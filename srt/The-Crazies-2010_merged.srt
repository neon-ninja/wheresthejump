1
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,981
Um, Dr. Dutten,

2
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,108
- my aunt's in town.
- Mm-hmm.

3
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,277
And she's sick, too.

4
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,571
I'm gonna need you to stay late tonight.

5
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,573
- Oh. You are?
- You know, you should probably

6
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,283
text your Aunt Scotty

7
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,911
and tell him you can't make it
to the baseball game today.

8
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,579
Wait a second.

9
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,915
- Okay, look, Scotty and I, we're not-
- Oh, come on, Becca.

10
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,958
- I mean-
- It's the worse-kept secret in town.

11
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,960
Now, that is saying a lot.

12
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,421
Go on.
Get outta here.

13
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,756
Go have some fun.

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,050
Thanks, Dr. Dutten.

15
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,442
Well, I don't care what the calendar says.

16
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,528
Opening day-
That's the first day of spring.

17
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,656
No, no, no.
The sheriff never pays for coffee.

18
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,616
Well, that's kind of you, Ben.

19
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,827
But the principal still has to pay
his parking tickets.

20
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,496
- Start him a tab.
- Yes, sir.

21
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,422
Kid throws fast.

22
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,174
Just like he drives.

23
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,010
Nice pitch, Scotty.

24
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,346
Come on, man! Come on, guys!

25
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,810
Strike two!

26
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,062
Whoo! Yeah!

27
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,785
Center field.

28
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,373
Oh, Jesus Christ.

29
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,128
Hey, Tommy!

30
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,215
- Stay there.
- What's he doing?

31
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,842
- Boys, get in the dugout.
- Move it off.

32
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,552
- Get off!
- Bring it in. Bring it in.

33
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,762
Get them off the field.

34
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,347
Get them in the dugout, Principal.

35
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,933
Rory. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

36
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,936
Hey, Rory, we got
a ballgame going on here.

37
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,272
We're playing ball,
and you come out with a gun?

38
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,358
What the hell are you doing?

39
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,193
Aw, Ror.

40
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,738
You're drunk, that's all.

41
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,532
All right? Let's just lay the gun down.

42
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,579
Rory, lay the gun down.

43
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,290
Hmm? Lay it down.

44
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,045
Hell, Rory, come on.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

45
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,463
Rory?

46
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,010
Now, you lay that gun down.

47
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,974
Rory?

48
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,647
Oh, my God.

49
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,101
I'll have blood alcohol for you in the morning.

50
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,813
A full tox screen will take about a week.

51
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,192
How are you holding up, David?

52
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,113
Peggy here yet?

53
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,198
She just walked in with her boy.

54
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,663
David, perhaps now is not the best time.

55
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,917
Son, settle down.

56
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,921
Hey, Curt.

57
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,133
Uh...

58
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,093
I'm so sorry.

59
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,264
I liked Rory. I liked him a lot.

60
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,141
What was he doing out there?

61
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,144
He had been drinking, that's all.

62
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,645
Rory quit two years ago.

63
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,815
You know how proud he was of that.

64
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,735
Is that what you're saying,
that he was drunk?

65
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,154
- Is that what you're telling people?
- No.

66
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,657
That you had to do it-
had to shoot the town drunk.

67
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,545
You did the right thing.

68
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,133
I need a new blade for this.

69
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,677
Hey, David.

70
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,181
You did the right thing.

71
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,238
You should be sleeping.

72
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,916
Sheriff's Department.

73
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,585
No, ma'am,
we can't comment on that.

74
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,421
That's an ongoing investigation.

75
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,465
No, ma'am, the sheriff
is not here right now,

76
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,468
but I can see if the deputy will-

77
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:35,139
Amateur.

78
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,726
Sheriff's Department.
Mm-hmm.

79
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,438
That's the medical examiner on line two.

80
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,985
Morning, Jim.
What have we got?

81
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,988
The toxicology reports are in.
The results are negative.

82
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,698
- Come again?
- There was no alcohol-

83
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,159
No, I heard what you said,
Jim, but that's not right.

84
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,787
- Rory was-
- David, we did the test twice.

85
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,540
Rory wasn't drunk.
There was no alcohol in his bloodstream.

86
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,752
We'll get the drug results
back in a couple of days, maybe a week.

87
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,587
Yeah, okay.

88
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,631
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

89
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,758
Do you want this car...

90
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,762
Bring it down here.

91
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Ben?

92
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,083
Ben!

93
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,047
Hey.

94
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,844
Hey, Ben. Ben!

95
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,847
Ben!

96
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,016
Hey. You all right?

97
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,231
Don't worry. The, uh...

98
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,316
kids are resilient.

99
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,360
They're gonna be all right.

100
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,362
Yeah.

101
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,447
I'm late. I gotta go.

102
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,785
- Deardra. Bill.
- Hey, Judy.

103
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,454
Little man.
How y'all doing?

104
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,748
Uh, would you mind
taking a look at Bill?

105
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,750
- Sure. What's wrong?
- I don't know.

106
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:30,504
He's just-
He's not right.

107
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,427
How are you feeling, Bill?

108
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,887
Any pain or discomfort?

109
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,308
Bill?

110
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,227
She worries too much. I'm fine.

111
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,313
Just a little tired.

112
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,148
You got any plans this weekend?

113
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,819
She worries too much. I'm fine.

114
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,488
Just a little tired.

115
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,782
His vitals are fine.

116
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,453
But, you know, I've gotta see a patient
in Cedar Rapids on Monday.

117
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,621
I wanna take Bill in to get a CT scan.

118
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,998
- Monday?
- Yeah.

119
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,168
Let's just make sure it's nothing serious.

120
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,669
- Okay.
- Okay?

121
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,463
You need me, you call me.

122
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:13,881
Day or night.

123
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,049
- Okay?
- Thanks, Judy.

124
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,633
See you, Nicholas.

125
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,094
- Bye, Judy.
- Bye, Bill!

126
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,551
What's Dad doing?

127
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,597
Wait here, Nicholas.

128
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,466
William!

129
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,598
William?

130
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,483
William, what are you doing?

131
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,679
William?

132
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:33,770
William!

133
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,274
Oh, God.

134
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,109
Nicholas!

135
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,659
Nicholas?

136
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,335
Nicholas.

137
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,173
Nicholas!

138
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

139
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,392
- Nicholas, are you okay?
- Shh, shh.

140
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,898
Nicholas, what happened?

141
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,817
It's Dad.

142
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,111
Wh-Where's Dad?

143
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,072
What happened?

144
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,657
Honey, please, talk to me.

145
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,784
Please.

146
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,079
He has a knife.

147
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,374
Oh, my God.

148
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,755
Stay back.

149
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,298
Stay right there.

150
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

151
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,797
William!

152
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,300
William!

153
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,228
William!

154
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,066
William, please, don't do this!

155
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,362
William, please let us out!

156
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,888
Hello.

157
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,514
Mmm.

158
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,518
I'm coming.

159
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,772
What is it?

160
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,983
Number 1, take the full pressure.

161
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,277
All right, team.
Get me some power.

162
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:29,279
- Oh, my God.
- The garage is lit up, too.

163
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,782
- Deardra!
- Tom, they get out?

164
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,785
Not Deardra and Nicholas.
Just Bill.

165
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,704
- I need two men on that Engine 3 quarter, south side.
- On it.

166
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,374
When we got here, there was
an empty gas can just sitting out front.

167
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,377
And Bill- Well, he was mowing the goddamn lawn.

168
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,880
David, Deardra and Nicholas
were upstairs locked inside a closet.

169
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,132
Bill! Bill!

170
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,009
Bill?

171
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,470
What the hell happened here?

172
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,307
- Oh, my God.
- Judy.

173
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,350
Oh, God.

174
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,143
- Judy, come on.
- No.

175
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,437
- What the fuck have you done?
- Judy, come on.

176
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,481
- Oh! Oh, David!
- Shh.

177
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,025
Oh, God!

178
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,153
Deardra!

179
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,073
Oh, my God!

180
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,991
Deardra!

181
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,561
What the hell?

182
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,484
What the hell?

183
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,072
What you got?

184
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,830
Shit!

185
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,540
Oh, my God.

186
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,128
Russ, you get in touch
with Sheriff Byrnes in Cedar Rapids?

187
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,049
- Russ?
- Uh, yeah.

188
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,469
State troopers are coming this afternoon
to pick him up for transfer.

189
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,304
How long has he been playing statue?

190
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,347
A couple hours now.

191
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,226
The same look Rory gave me.

192
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,645
The same goddamn look.

193
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,987
Shit.

194
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,283
Sheriff's Department.

195
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,662
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. Slow down.

196
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,797
Been there at least a week
by the looks of things.

197
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,925
I'll check to see
if there's any identification.

198
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,093
Yeah.

199
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,137
Do that.

200
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,559
Boys, last I checked,
hunting season ended three months ago.

201
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,770
We was just out taking in a little nature.

202
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,356
- Fresh air is all.
- Guns away till fall.

203
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,733
- Aw, come on, Sheriff.
- What, are you kidding me?

204
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,361
- What's with this guy?
- Well, we got us a pilot.

205
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,822
Where's the plane?

206
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,324
You know, last week,
Travis Quinn was going around

207
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,118
saying he heard something crash
out by Hautman Bog.

208
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:25,163
- I didn't think nothing of it.
- On account of him being full of shit?

209
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,165
As a general rule.

210
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,710
- Well, maybe there's the exception.
- Maybe.

211
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,637
You said it sounded like a plane, Trav?

212
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,305
Sheriff, about the reward-

213
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,641
Shit. Big plane? Little plane?
What? Come on now.

214
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,643
If you can explain the difference
how those two sound,

215
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,895
- I might be able to figure it out.
- You're full of shit.

216
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,647
He's full of shit.

217
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,316
People only ask for a reward
when there's something to find.

218
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,818
Is it gonna be a big reward, Sheriff?

219
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,319
Travis, you ask about that again,

220
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,154
I'm gonna throw you
out of the fucking boat.

221
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,240
You're not gonna shoot me?

222
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,493
Travis.

223
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,495
Yeah?

224
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,206
Kill the engine.

225
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,337
It was a big plane, Russ.

226
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,006
Why is that?

227
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,341
'Cause we're right on top of it.

228
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,541
Kevin, which way does
the water flow through town?

229
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,335
Nice to see you, too, Dave.

230
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,086
Waste water or drinking?

231
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,422
- Drinking.
- Give me a second.

232
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,134
A plane that size goes down-

233
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,345
nothing in the paper,
nothing in the news.

234
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,264
- Make any sense to you?
- It depends on what the payload is.

235
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,224
Exactly what I'm thinking.

236
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,477
Which is what?

237
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,896
Hautman Bog-
What's that drain into?

238
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,564
- Dwyer Creek.
- Which drains into?

239
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,816
Black Pond. Oh, hey,
you remember monster catfish-

240
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,153
Russell, where do you think
we get our drinking water from?

241
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,365
Treated water comes in from the north,
breaks east-west.

242
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,075
And what house does it get to first?

243
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,744
Uh, let's see.

244
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,746
Rory Hamill.

245
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:41,299
You wanna shut off
the entire town's water supply on a hunch?

246
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:44,928
Mayor, I've got three dead bodies
in the morgue in the last 48 hours.

247
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,138
David, take a look around you.

248
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,974
This is a farming community.

249
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,976
It is springtime.
It is planting season.

250
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,936
You turn off the water,
you're gonna kill the crops.

251
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,606
You kill the crops, and you bankrupt
every family in Pierce County.

252
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:59,734
And that is not based
on some, uh, hunch.

253
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,319
That's a fact.

254
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,657
Water stays on.

255
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,964
Uh, Sheriff,

256
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,632
I'm all for a little civil disobedience,

257
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:26,386
but, um, I think this one
might cost you your job.

258
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,057
You know what, Russ?

259
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,354
That wouldn't be such a bad thing.

260
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,577
What the fuck?

261
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Shh. Hang on a second.

262
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,594
Well, is he dead?

263
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Well, if he is, he won't mind waiting.

264
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,481
Oh! Jesus Christ!

265
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,612
Did we or did we not request
a transfer for him this morning?

266
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,696
Mm-hmm.

267
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,452
God damn it.

268
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,709
Even better.

269
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,340
- You know what?
- What?

270
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,760
We're in trouble.

271
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,836
Hello?

272
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,142
Jim?

273
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,782
Jim?

274
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,791
Jesus Christ.

275
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Behind you.

276
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

277
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,175
Christ Almighty.

278
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,434
David, I'm not gonna do this.

279
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,144
I can't go to my parents.

280
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,271
- You have no idea-
- And neither do you.

281
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,149
Look, whatever it is,
I can't just leave.

282
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,193
- Are you gonna leave?
- I'm the sheriff.

283
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,652
- I'm their doctor.
- Yeah, well,

284
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,488
if it turns out what they need is penicillin,

285
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,656
I'll call you.

286
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:21,824
David.

287
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,409
What?

288
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,579
What?

289
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,750
There's somebody outside.

290
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
David!
Get on the ground!

291
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,561
This is secure.

292
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,607
All right! Let's go, men! Move it!

293
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,609
Come on. Let's go.
Keep it moving.

294
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:43,072
Sheriff, what's going on?

295
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,324
- I don't know any more than you do.
- Keep moving, sir.

296
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,534
Please take the first open seat.

297
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,412
A funny thing happened
on the way to Cedar Rapids.

298
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,873
Bastards spiked my tires.

299
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,333
Who are these fuckers, man?

300
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,623
Keep moving.
Everyone must exit the bus.

301
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:34,957
Keep moving, please.

302
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,876
Let's go, let's go!

303
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,795
Stay in line, sir.
Keep up with the group, please.

304
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,965
Please head into the tent.

305
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,343
- There is no need for alarm.
- Inside, please.

306
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,803
Forward, please.

307
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,972
- Please keep moving into the tent.
- Please step forward.

308
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,099
Let's go.
Keep moving, please.

309
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,268
Hey, can one of you guys
tell me what's going on?

310
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,480
- I'm sorry. You're gonna have to keep moving.
- Sir, come with me.

311
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,606
- Let's go!
- No!

312
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,149
- Russell!
- Don't touch me!

313
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,235
- Coming through!
- The temperature spiked.

314
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,658
- Ma'am-
- What are you people doing?

315
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,409
Judy- Hey, don't touch me.

316
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,370
- Hey!
- Both of you, out!

317
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,914
Let's go.
Keep moving, please.

318
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,375
- Go ahead. This way, please.
- Judy, what does it mean?

319
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,585
- They're checking for elevated temperatures.
- Clear.

320
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,837
Farnum was bleeding from the nose.
So was Rory.

321
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,339
Well, cerebral hemorrhaging-

322
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,174
It's gotta be some kind of virus.

323
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,343
- You gotta wait here.
- Look, I'm a sheriff.

324
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,178
- She's a doctor. We know these people.
- Clear.

325
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:32,181
Would you just tell us what's going on?
Maybe we can actually help you.

326
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,519
- Take her in there!
- David!

327
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,230
Go, go, go!

328
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,525
David!
Get off me! Stop!

329
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:46,279
David! Wait! Wait!

330
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,030
Stand back! Now!

331
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,032
- Wait! Wait! Wait!
- Judy! Judy!

332
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,284
Wait!

333
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,745
David! David!

334
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,706
Judy!

335
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:01,877
David! David! David!

336
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,089
Please.

337
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,008
Please help me.

338
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,302
Please. Please.

339
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:21,230
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving.

340
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,441
We got Trayberg scrubbed and ready.

341
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,484
Let's go, let's go.

342
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,364
Please. Please.

343
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,658
Don't. Please. Don't.

344
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,705
No.

345
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,415
No. Please.

346
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,001
Please. I'm pregnant.

347
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,711
Please! No!

348
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,280
Let's go!

349
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,699
Franklin, open these doors!

350
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,744
Quickly, people.
We're getting you outta here.

351
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,621
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

352
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,581
- Keep moving!
- Come on!

353
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,963
Let's go, let's go.

354
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,549
Extend your right arm,
please, sir. Let's go.

355
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,135
You'll be given a card.
It looks like this.

356
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,971
Do not lose it.

357
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,851
Keep it moving.

358
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,490
We have an inbound vehicle
coming in from the northern perimeter.

359
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,784
Do you have clearance ID? Over.

360
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:02,665
We have no ID.

361
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,173
We have gunfire!

362
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:16,011
It's a civilian vehicle!

363
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,349
- Behind you!
- Right there! Right there!

364
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,535
Keep moving.

365
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,579
Kevin, where's Linda?

366
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,373
- They took her. Judy?
- They took her, too.

367
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,083
They took George and Francine

368
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,543
and Winton Simon
and a whole mess of other people.

369
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,254
- Jake! Jake! Jake!
- Mom!

370
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,631
Let's go, people.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

371
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,675
I'm going back.

372
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,719
They got the whole town sealed off.

373
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,679
Roadblocks on every highway.

374
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,431
Tim Mitchell tried to run one.

375
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,266
They shot him dead.
His entire family.

376
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,768
Keep it moving.
Come up ahead.

377
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,978
David, this here
might be your only chance.

378
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,148
Don't lose it running off
on some fool's errand.

379
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,734
Judy's a fool's errand?

380
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,819
You know what I'm saying.

381
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,782
I'll tell you what, Kev.

382
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,867
Don't ask me why I can't leave
without my wife.

383
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,577
I won't ask you why you can.

384
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:31,670
We got a breach in the yard!
Got a breach in the yard!

385
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,006
Move out! Move out!
Let's go! Evacuate!

386
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,300
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

387
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,427
The crazies have breached
the containment area!

388
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:41,430
- The military's pulling out!
- We gotta get outta here!

389
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,644
Come on! Go!
Get on board!

390
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,604
- We're outta here!
- Move! Move! Move!

391
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,982
Take 'em out!

392
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,694
On board! On board!

393
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,152
Nice to see you, too, Chief.

394
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,572
Oh, shit.

395
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,082
How'd you get out?

396
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,375
Tom Ellis ran his pickup
through the fence.

397
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,335
Fucking military started shooting.

398
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,004
Townsfolk going nuts.

399
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:58,007
Before you know it,
people are just running off into the fields.

400
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,342
David, Judy was still inside.

401
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,511
- I'm sorry.
- She's not sick.

402
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,806
She's been running a fever all month.
Russ, she's pregnant.

403
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,057
It's about time.

404
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,101
I'm gonna go get her.

405
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,937
Hoo-fucking-yah.
Let's go to the high school.

406
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,046
Becca? Becca!

407
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,048
Is that you?

408
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,551
Oh, God. Honey-

409
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:45,387
Honey, are you hurt?

410
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,598
Is this really happening?

411
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:51,310
It's gonna be all right.
We're gonna be okay.

412
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,605
You don't really believe that, do you?

413
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,166
Shh.

414
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,241
Oh. Shh. Shh.

415
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,578
Please, Principal Sandborn, please stop.

416
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,538
Please, let me go.

417
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,333
Please don't do this.

418
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,959
No. Please don't do this.

419
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:24,296
Please. No, no. Please.

420
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,632
No!

421
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,018
Oh, shit.

422
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,194
What are you doing? Stop!

423
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,238
No. Please. Please.

424
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,241
- No! N-
- Just get out of here, please.

425
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:55,410
Stop. Please go. Don't.

426
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,830
- Don't hurt her. Please, just go away.
- Please.

427
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,248
Please.

428
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,251
Please stop. Please stop.

429
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,920
Stop. Leave her alone.

430
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,630
Stop.

431
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,633
Please just get out of here. Please.

432
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,636
No.

433
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:15,180
No!

434
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,393
Oh! Oh!

435
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,729
Oh, God! Oh, David!

436
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,482
David! Oh, God!

437
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,526
Are you okay?

438
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,362
No, not really.

439
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,784
- Uh, Chief?
- We gotta get to Quik Phil's truck stop on 35.

440
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:38,996
They're putting people on buses,
and they're getting them out of here.

441
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:43,250
We're gonna go. Come on.

442
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:48,338
- Did Peter call?
- Shh.

443
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,010
- Did Peter call?
- That's gonna be me.

444
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:56,180
Russell, we've got enough problems
without you inventing them.

445
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,973
- That's easy for you to say.
- Did Peter call?

446
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,600
You're at the end of the pot mine.

447
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,268
I'm a half mile from the farm.

448
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,352
- Who's the sheriff?
- What?

449
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,354
Who's the sheriff of Pierce County?

450
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,607
- You are.
- I am. Who's the deputy?

451
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,983
- That would be me.
- You are.

452
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,484
Deputy does what the sheriff tells him.

453
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:12,863
That's the balance of power.
And I'm telling you,

454
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,782
you're not getting sick,
you understand me?

455
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,161
Did Peter call?

456
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:23,248
Did Peter call?

457
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,126
I hope you're right, Chief.

458
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:29,588
I'm not world leader, but I had plans.

459
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,131
Did Peter call?

460
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,799
Come on.

461
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,440
Let's go.

462
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,345
I'll check the truck.

463
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,765
Fuck.

464
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,645
Aw, shit!
It's booted.

465
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,150
- They all are.
- I'll check those cars.

466
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,454
It's not booted.

467
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,377
Whoa, whoa.

468
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,422
Russell,

469
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,007
get out of the truck.

470
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:57,509
Just give me a second.

471
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,094
Oh, Jesus.

472
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,930
Go. Run. Go on.

473
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:03,974
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

474
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,600
Get down, get down, get down.

475
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,275
Come on, boys.

476
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,027
Come on! Get him!

477
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,323
Come on! Yeah!

478
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:20,949
Whoo!

479
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:22,409
Oh, yeah!

480
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,954
- Whoo!
- Run, little man!

481
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,748
Run!

482
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,624
- Get him!
- Whoo!

483
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:34,212
- Nice shot. Nice shot.
- Oh, yeah!

484
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:35,964
Huh? Nice shot.

485
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:38,550
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- Nice shot, huh?

486
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,385
Whoo!

487
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,183
Come on. Get him.

488
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:49,144
Hey, straight through the heart!

489
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,521
- Uh-huh!
- Yeah!

490
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,148
Shit.

491
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,358
- Come on.
- Huh?

492
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,360
Hey, he's gonna dress up real nice.

493
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,571
Come on, boy.

494
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,992
Come on.
Get him up on there.

495
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,342
Good shot, man.

496
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,928
I knew I was okay about that shot.

497
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,368
It's a hell of a walk to Quik Phil's.

498
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,955
I got the old cruiser on blocks.

499
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,040
That piece of shit still works?

500
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,542
Yeah.

501
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:56,086
I guess you can't boot a car without wheels.

502
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,046
It's seven miles to my place.

503
00:45:58,131 --> 00:45:59,881
It's five if we cut through
the McGregor farm.

504
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,426
Another 20 to Quik Phil's from there.

505
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,262
- I'm fine.
- Good.

506
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:06,346
Let's go.

507
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,480
They took my blood.

508
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:21,820
Ran at least one test that I saw.

509
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:26,575
What if the reason they didn't let me go
is because I have it?

510
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,578
You're pregnant.
That's why you have a fever.

511
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:33,248
David, you can't know that for sure.

512
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,084
I can, and I do.

513
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,547
If you're sick, I'm sick.
We drank from the same tap.

514
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,633
And I'm not sick.
None of us are.

515
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,348
We are gonna get through this.

516
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,815
What the fuck?

517
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,651
Scotty McGregor.
It's her boyfriend.

518
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:02,944
Russell, stop her.

519
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:03,945
- Yeah, I got it.
- David-

520
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,239
We don't have time for this.

521
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,366
You had time for me.

522
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,208
Okay, let's go.

523
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:22,130
It looks deserted.

524
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:23,548
Scotty?

525
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,053
- Scotty?
- Get back!

526
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,722
- Drop the fucking gun, Scotty.
- I will blow your head off.

527
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,141
- Scotty, it's me.
- Stay here.

528
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:37,187
Scotty, don't be an asshole.
We're fine.

529
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,149
Scotty.

530
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,151
Scotty, put the gun down.

531
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:44,653
Put it down.

532
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,404
Scotty.

533
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,500
Sorry.

534
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,254
Had to be sure.

535
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:06,466
Yeah, well, that's
a two-way street there, Scotty.

536
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:12,180
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

537
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:13,974
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

538
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,059
- Scotty, where's your mom?
- Back at the house.

539
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,103
We were just getting some supplies
before we started walking.

540
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,689
The sheriff's got a car.
You two can come with us.

541
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:23,441
- Are you okay?
- Better than you guys.

542
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,319
- How's your mom?
- Be quiet.

543
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:29,155
- Get in the barn.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

544
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,981
Russ.

545
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:13,867
- We have one civilian coming out.
- What are you doing?

546
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,244
- Ma'am, please.
- Stop! Stop!

547
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:17,621
We need you downstairs.

548
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,372
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Wait.

549
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:22,042
- We just need to process you.
- Oh, no.

550
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,835
- Please!
- Okay, I got an adult male.

551
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,712
I just need you...

552
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,339
It'll just take a second, ma'am.

553
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:29,132
Too late.

554
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,095
Hold it right there!

555
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,853
Scotty!

556
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,234
Okay, light them up.

557
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,789
Okay, let's go! Split it up!

558
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:03,124
I want a complete sweep of the area!

559
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,959
Take my gun.
Close the back of the barn.

560
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:08,088
Move, move, move!

561
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:39,077
Don't kill me, please.
Don't kill me.

562
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,161
Oh, fuck.

563
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:43,415
How could you do it?
How could you...

564
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,417
- Becca-
- You make a sound louder than this,

565
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,168
and I'll kill you, you understand?

566
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:49,003
- What the hell was that?
- Orders, sir.

567
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,839
- Who, asshole?
- Whoever gives them- I don't know.

568
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:52,674
- Bullshit!
- What the fuck is going on here?

569
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,093
All's they said is that there'd been
some sort of accident.

570
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,846
My whole unit got flown in.
We didn't even know what state we was in

571
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,099
till we seen the license plates.

572
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:09,733
Am I gonna die without my mask on?

573
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,943
Is that what they told you-

574
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,945
If you took your mask off,
you were gonna die?

575
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,198
They just said to keep it on.

576
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,118
Look, um,

577
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,871
I know I don't deserve
any favors from you people,

578
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:25,957
but if you let me go,
I swear to God I won't say nothing.

579
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,793
I didn't sign up
to shoot unarmed civilians.

580
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,213
- I'll just leave, okay?
- Sit down.

581
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,090
- Put the gun down, Russ.
- Chief...

582
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,720
I'm a sheriff.
That's my deputy.

583
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,514
Look, my wife's a doctor.
She's pregnant.

584
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,933
- Becca here is not even 18.
- When he blabs, they'll find us.

585
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,102
If we don't let him go,
they'll find us for sure.

586
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:49,314
And besides,
he's not gonna blab.

587
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,192
No, sir.

588
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:03,912
You gotta give it to him, Russ.

589
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:04,996
Shit.

590
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,749
I'm sorry about your folks' town.

591
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,210
- Hey, one up!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

592
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,170
Any crazies back there, Babcock?

593
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:16,883
Babcock?

594
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:19,594
No. We're all clear.

595
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,971
Good. Military's pulling
back to the perimeter.

596
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,015
Let's go. Come on.

597
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,186
Barn's clear!

598
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,438
- We're secure back there!
- All right, then.

599
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:32,982
Mount up!
We're moving out!

600
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:55,171
If what that soldier said is true,

601
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,757
this disease has gone airborne.

602
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,638
We just have to keep going.

603
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:04,991
Uh, we'll go and get
the car up and running.

604
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,285
- Come on.
- Go.

605
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,207
Hey.

606
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,001
Hey, hey, hey.

607
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:26,346
It's perfect.

608
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,434
It's a perfect, beautiful morning,

609
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,436
and this is our home.

610
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,438
This is where we were
gonna raise our baby.

611
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,690
We can still do all those things.

612
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,108
Hmm?

613
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,029
Everyone we know...

614
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,948
is dead.

615
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:51,996
This town is dead,
and it's not coming back.

616
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:56,000
It's never coming back.

617
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,968
Fuck, yeah.

618
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:07,261
See if you can find a toolbox.

619
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:08,846
Okay.

620
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,132
This was gonna be your room.

621
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,140
Judy.

622
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Look, I know this is hard,
but we've gotta keep moving.

623
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,431
This is the gun that killed your father.

624
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,650
Baby.

625
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:28,486
Peggy- Peggy, no. Not Judy.

626
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,572
No. No, no, no.

627
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:33,741
I shot him.
I did. I shot him.

628
00:57:33,826 --> 00:57:35,409
Yes.

629
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,245
Peggy, I shot him.

630
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,288
Look at me, you crazy bitch!

631
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,500
That's it.
I fucking shot him!

632
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,418
I did it!

633
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,838
He walked on that field
with a loaded shotgun!

634
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:49,173
And I'm glad I did!

635
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:51,050
They should give me a fucking medal!

636
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,302
I finally killed the town drunk!

637
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

638
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,712
Oh!

639
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,689
- Oh, God.
- We're okay.

640
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,858
- Baby!
- Oh, my God.

641
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,153
Let me see your hand.

642
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,530
Give me the Betadine.

643
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,869
Yep, that's it. Here.

644
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,037
Shit.

645
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,345
Russell. Russell!

646
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,347
Just making sure.

647
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,490
He's sick, David.

648
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:41,369
You don't know that.

649
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:42,620
- You saw what he did.
- Hey, guys.

650
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,122
Come on. We gotta go.

651
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,002
He saved our lives.

652
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,088
That's what I saw.

653
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,137
Hey, you feeling okay?

654
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,556
- She's fine.
- Well, I'm just saying, if she's getting sick,

655
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,225
- we don't wanna be in the fucking car with her.
- Russell, she's fine.

656
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,768
I'm not sick.

657
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,771
You wouldn't know,
'cause that'd be the sickness

658
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:53,024
- messing with your mind.
- Okay. Russell, that's enough.

659
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,776
Don't lose your head.

660
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,279
What do you mean by that?

661
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,364
I mean, don't lose your head.

662
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:01,991
What do you mean by that, Chief?

663
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,868
I mean...

664
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:05,828
She's fine.

665
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,873
Now, just...

666
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,086
Fuck!

667
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:18,466
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.

668
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:22,303
- David, honey...
- Aw, shit.

669
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,096
Guys, it's turning around.

670
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:25,306
- It's coming back for us!
- Shit! Let's go!

671
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,392
We gotta get out of here!

672
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:31,270
- Go! Chief, let's go!
- The helicopter's coming!

673
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:55,920
- We can't stay on the highway.
- No.

674
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,588
There's gotta be another road we can take.

675
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,216
- What road? Tell me?
- I don't know. There's gotta be something.

676
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,176
- What road can they not see? Tell me.
- What?

677
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,178
What road can they not see?

678
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,846
What magic road can they not see?

679
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:08,224
Tell me, and I'll fucking go.

680
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
David, I'm just trying to help.
I'm sorry.

681
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,736
- I saw someone.
- Move. Where?

682
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:23,697
He was back there.
I know I saw someone.

683
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,699
Uh...

684
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:29,120
- Oh, fuck.
- Shit.

685
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,081
What the fuck?

686
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,251
David, get us outta here.

687
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:40,256
Oh, shit.

688
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,883
Start the car.

689
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,051
Come on, Chief.

690
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,388
Let's go. Come on.
Get us outta here.

691
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:52,726
Let's go! Let's go!

692
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,980
Come on!

693
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:04,655
Come on!

694
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,407
- Let's go!
- All right!

695
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,576
Come on!

696
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,995
Come on! Let's go!

697
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,080
- Why aren't we moving?
- Why the fuck aren't we moving, Chief?

698
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:15,833
- 'Cause I can't get any fucking traction.
- Go! Go!

699
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,085
Fuck! Let's go!
Get us outta here! Come on!

700
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,089
I don't wanna die like this!

701
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,049
What the fuck was that?

702
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,972
- There! There! Right there!
- Motherfucker!

703
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,140
- Russell- Russ-
- There!

704
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,141
Oh, shit!

705
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,142
Motherfucker!

706
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,562
Russell!

707
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,064
- Oh, fuck!
- Russell!

708
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,441
I saw movement!

709
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:43,110
Everything is fucking moving!

710
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000

Go! Come on! Come on!

711
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:37,831
- Stop the fucking car!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

712
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:39,750
Stop the car!

713
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,418
- Stop!
- Judy!

714
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:45,881
Shit! David!

715
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:48,384
Help me here!
Help me!

716
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:52,054
Oh, God, please.
You're okay.

717
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:56,100
Becca! Becca! Becca!

718
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:06,277
Oh, no.

719
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,784
Becca.

720
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No.
Becca.

721
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,604
That's my truck.

722
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:26,023
Fuckers spiked my tires.

723
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:39,912
Shit.

724
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:53,008
God damn it!

725
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:55,803
We need water.

726
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:57,304
I know.

727
01:06:57,389 --> 01:07:00,391
Guys, car coming!

728
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:12,069
Stay here.

729
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,029
David, what are you doing?

730
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:16,365
We're taking this car.

731
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:32,506
- Motherfucker!
- Russ!

732
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,383
What are you- No!

733
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,136
Whoo!

734
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:04,037
Welcome to Pierce County,
friendliest place on earth, asshole.

735
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:06,081
Russ, I wanna talk to him.

736
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,585
Okay.

737
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,879
Who the fuck do you think you are?

738
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:15,215
I'm the guy standing between you and a bullet.

739
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,177
Now, what was on that plane?

740
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:21,180
What was on that goddamn plane?

741
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,681
Trixie.

742
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:25,100
Rhabdoveridae prototype.

743
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:27,227
A- A fucking biological weapon.
- It was headed

744
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:30,063
- to an incinerator in Texas.
- Whoa. What is this?

745
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:32,733
You're telling me that you guys
engineered this crap?

746
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:35,402
It's designed to destabilize a population.

747
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,571
In this case, the wrong one.

748
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,198
Look, fella, we lost a plane.

749
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:41,408
What do you want me to say?

750
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,872
How about, "Sorry for destroying
your whole goddamn town"?

751
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,416
- What would you have preferred, a global pandemic?
- Wait. Wait.

752
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:52,211
Take it up with the pilot.
I came here to help.

753
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,129
Help who? Help us?

754
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:56,256
What- What is the incubation period?

755
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,258
48 hours.

756
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:00,761
After that, you're either dead
or you don't have it.

757
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Fine. It's day three,
and we're still talking.
So you are gonna help us.

758
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:09,853
What the fuck!

759
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:11,522
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, my God!

760
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:13,482
What the fuck is the matter with you?

761
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,651
I said that I wanted to talk to him!

762
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:18,487
You talked.

763
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,017
Shit.

764
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,441
I'm gonna need that back.

765
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:57,943
I'll carry it for a while.

766
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,571
- You've been carrying it the whole time.
- Oh, no. Really.

767
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:02,281
I got it.

768
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,700
You sure?

769
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:06,118
Yeah.

770
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:21,508
Russell, we're on your side.

771
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,886
My side? Shit.
I didn't even know there were sides.

772
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,013
- There's not. I'm just-
- Shut up the fuck up!

773
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:28,265
- Tell her to shut up, or I'll kill her, too.
- Russell, no!

774
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:30,559
- Judy, stop talking.
- Okay.

775
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,561
Let him think about what he's doing.

776
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,438
Uh-huh.

777
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:40,444
One, two,

778
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,321
three.

779
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:47,576
That's how many times
I've saved your life.

780
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:50,746
Go on.

781
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,748
Walk out where I can see you.

782
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:53,832
Move!

783
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:20,901
Fucking heavy.

784
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:30,786
Move!

785
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:43,715
- Fuck it. I'm gonna confront him.
- No, David. Don't. Please.

786
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,469
If we don't make it to that truck stop,
we're dead anyway.

787
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,013
- Don't, David. Don't.
- Back off!

788
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:52,599
- I wanna talk to you.
- I will fucking shoot you where you stand.

789
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:54,518
- I just wanna talk.
- David, stop.

790
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:56,269
You better listen to me.

791
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:57,771
- David.
- Put the gun down.

792
01:11:57,855 --> 01:12:00,565
- Final warning, Chief.
- Put it down.

793
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:03,652
Please? Just put it down.

794
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,113
I just wanna talk.

795
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:09,783
You and me, man to man.

796
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:11,535
Come on.

797
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,746
- Shit.
- Okay.

798
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,540
Here's the deal.

799
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,710
Fuck!

800
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,099
Hey.

801
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:38,729
You remember that monster catfish
I caught last summer?

802
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:40,772
What'd he weigh, you reckon?

803
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:46,486
35, 40 pounds.

804
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:48,155
Shit.

805
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,241
It was a big son of a bitch.

806
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,838
I'm not right, am I?

807
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:18,769
Can I walk with you guys?

808
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:23,398
Just a little while longer?

809
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:27,277
Please?

810
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,854
Shit.

811
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:06,399
If you cut through there,
you can make it to the highway on the other side.

812
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:09,486
- They'll see us.
- Nah, they'll be focusing on me.

813
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:13,573
Deputy does what
the sheriff tells him, right?

814
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,158
You're the sheriff.

815
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:18,745
Come on, Chief.

816
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,413
I'm done.

817
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:22,874
I'm gonna die here no matter what.

818
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,293
So let it mean something.

819
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:29,089
Let it mean that you two made it.
Give me that.

820
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:51,778
Hoo-fucking-yah.

821
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,991
We got an inbound!

822
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:57,951
- Hey!
- Attention!

823
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:01,121
- You have entered a military operation.
- Hey! Hey!

824
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:03,081
Please identify yourself.

825
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,791
My name's Deputy Russell Crank,

826
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:06,793
the Pierce County Sheriff's Department.

827
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:09,629
- Keep your hands in the air and walk slowly.
- It's okay. I'm not sick.

828
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:11,047
Make no sudden movements

829
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:12,799
- or you will be fired upon.
- Oh, shit.

830
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:15,177
We are a live-fire operation.

831
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:17,012
Get out from behind the vehicle.

832
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:20,223
You are in breach of
a Level 4 military operation.

833
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:30,025
Reveal yourself,
or we will open fire.

834
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:35,488
- Proceed slowly with your hands in the air.
- It's okay.

835
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:37,199
It's okay.

836
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,993
Now stop there
and get down on the ground.

837
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:42,996
Stop and get down on the ground!

838
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,415
Get down on the ground now!

839
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:52,297
- He's down!
- Man down! Cease fire!

840
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,466
Fireteam Bravo, move up.

841
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,343
Alpha Team, stand by!

842
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:58,261
Let's go, let's go!

843
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,265
Approach with caution.

844
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,684
Movement in tight.
He's still breathing!

845
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:07,354
Secure that weapon!

846
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:10,273
Stay on him.

847
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:15,070
Fuck you for what you did.

848
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:31,253
Hey! Get an 18-Wheeler Dog

849
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,588
only at Quik Phil's.

850
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:36,758
Football fans,
show your support this off-season

851
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:40,262
with our University of Iowa
Hawkeyes Snack Pack.

852
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:43,431
One jar of hot sauce and one jar of salsa

853
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,725
in a collectible Iowa Hawkeyes helmet.

854
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,395
Available while supplies last

855
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:51,564
only at Quik Phil's.

856
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:53,900
It was Grand Central last night.

857
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:58,196
Nothing satisfies hunger
better than a Quik Phil's Mega-burger.

858
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:00,198
Take it to go or eat it here

859
01:17:00,283 --> 01:17:03,785
- in one of our panoramic dining areas.
- Wait here.

860
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,258
Hello?

861
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:16,191
Judy?

862
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:20,236
Judy! Judy!

863
01:18:25,076 --> 01:18:27,702
Judy, you all right?

864
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:48,431
Ohh.

865
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:06,074
They exterminated everyone,
not just the sick.

866
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,535
- Look, there's a rig we can take.
- What's the point?

867
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:11,121
- If we get out of here, they're gonna kill us, too.
- No.

868
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:13,498
- If we get to Cedar Rapids-
- David, can you just stop it?

869
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,292
- If we get to Cedar Rapids-
- Can you stop pretending

870
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:18,628
everything is gonna be okay?

871
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:20,296
All right.

872
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:23,174
For Christ sakes.

873
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,142
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

874
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:41,943
You wanna give up?

875
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:45,405
You wanna sit here and die?

876
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:46,906
Tell me,

877
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:50,493
and I will sit here and die with you.

878
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,645
You gonna go get that truck?

879
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:28,508
Blackbird 2, this is T.O.C.

880
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:31,886
We are approaching T minus ten minutes.
Confirm status.

881
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:34,597
This is Blackbird 2...

882
01:21:52,283 --> 01:21:53,741
All units, this is T.O.C.

883
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:55,743
Be advised we are at ready status.

884
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,329
Proceed to countdown.

885
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:00,582
Countdown procedure initiated.

886
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,376
We are at T minus ten minutes.

887
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,295
All right. Blackbird 2 is in the air-

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

893
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:45,348
Honey, it's fine.

01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:46,849
It's okay.

895

Oh, shit.

Oh, shit. Baby, come on.
Come on. Come on.

God damn it!

902
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:18,714
David, come on.

I'm sorry. It's okay.

They've gotta be in here somewhere,
David. Come on.

Come on, baby. Come on.

Let's get the fuck out of here, huh?

912
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:48,447
The smallest, straightest road
to Cedar Rapids.

913
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:50,366
Yeah. Perfect.

No.

931
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:12,782

We want to update you
on late-breaking news.

946
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:21,238
A massive fire in Ogden Marsh
continues to rage,

947
01:34:21,323 --> 01:34:23,157
and high winds are preventing fire teams

948
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:25,034
from containing the deadly blaze.

949
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:28,287
Now, information is still coming in,
but what we currently know:

950
01:34:28,371 --> 01:34:32,207
An explosion rocked the Dakon Petrol
chemical plant early this morning,

951
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:36,462
with eyewitness reports
of a 400-foot fireball that lit up the sky.

952
01:34:36,546 --> 01:34:38,714
We also have reports
of a second explosion

953
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:40,924
at a nearby truck fueling station.

954
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:44,178
A perimeter has been set
in an effort to contain the blaze,

955
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:46,013
and civilians are not being permitted
into that area.
