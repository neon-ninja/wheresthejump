1
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,000
<i>Close your eyes...</i>

2
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,958
<i>...and place your attention on your breath.</i>

3
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,958
<i>Breathe in...</i>

4
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,166
<i>and out.</i>

5
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,833
<i>Just put your attention on the breath
coming into your body as you inhale.</i>

6
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,500
<i>It's clear.</i>

7
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,625
<i>Nothing.</i>

8
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,125
<i>And as you breathe out...</i>

9
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,458
<i>...the air
that comes out of you is black.</i>

10
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,625
<i>And that black is any anxiety, stress,</i>

11
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,083
<i>any worries that you carry.</i>

12
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,708
<i>And as you breathe out,
feel it leave your body.</i>

13
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,208
<i>Breathe in clear air
and breathe out the black.</i>

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,916
<i>Breathe in clear air.</i>

15
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:04,583
<i>Breathe out...</i>

16
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,416
There I am standing

17
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,708
in front of this old
nothing house, staring at it,

18
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,958
and this bloke comes over.

19
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,958
And I recognize him, you know?

20
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,333
Older, but I recognize him.

21
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:44,000
I said, "It's me, Paul Emery.
I used to live in that house."

22
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,875
And he goes, "No. No, you didn't."

23
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I said, "You're Chris."

24
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:01,291
"Chris. You had that German Shepherd."
He says, "How did you know that?"

25
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,000
"We lived in this house for years."

26
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,666
- This old fellow...
- You heading to WA for work?

27
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,708
No.

28
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,000
Never actually been there before.

29
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:18,875
Yourself?

30
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,791
Home. Headed home.

31
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,333
No, I just had to, uh, clear out...

32
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,916
Clear out of Queensland.

33
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,000
Sort myself a car.

34
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,291
Some place to stay and that.

35
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,333
I'm Paul.

36
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:48,708
Henry.

37
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,791
Turn her off again.

38
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,333
And again.

39
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,583
Yeah. Let's hear her, mate.

40
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,208
I need an address for
the transfer of ownership.

41
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:28,833
Yeah.

42
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,333
- I can put down a motel?
- I don't know about that.

43
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:37,416
- That's where I'm living. A motel.
- Can't put down a motel.

44
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,375
I've got a PO box you can use,
put that down while he sorts himself out.

45
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,625
- Okay.
- Thanks.

46
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,125
Thanks, Henry.

47
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:46,708
All right.

48
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,333
$1,600.

49
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,791
- Here, mate. That's for you.
- Nah.

50
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,708
Come on, mate.
I mean, you really helped me out.

51
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,625
No.

52
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,041
What do you do for work, Henry?

53
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,666
Everything I know is in my hands.

54
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,750
Can't hardly work now though.

55
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,666
I'll be fucked in a few years' time.

56
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,625
And why's that?

57
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,250
Can't fuckin' breathe, mate.

58
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,458
I know what it's like to be
on the other side of things.

59
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,291
You got your last few fuckin' dollars
in an envelope there.

60
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,708
I see it all over you.

61
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,375
Paul Emery?

62
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,750
<i>I can't, uh,
take your call at the moment.</i>

63
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,333
<i>If you leave me a message,
I'll endeavor to call you back later.</i>

64
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,458
Henry, it's Paul.

65
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,208
I need to talk to you about something.

66
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,750
I might need to shift out of the motel.

67
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,208
So give us a ring back when you get this.

68
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,291
Okay. Talk soon.

69
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:21,458
So it's just a bit further up here.
There's a house. You can drop me off.

70
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,791
All right, I have to tell you, Henry...

71
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:30,625
I came out here
to do a job for some people.

72
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,625
And there's a mate of mine.

73
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:38,208
Mark. He asked me if I knew anyone
who could handle a bit of work.

74
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,291
I talked to him about you.

75
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,291
Yeah, just here is good.

76
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,250
Yeah, this is good. Just here.

77
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,416
What kind of work?

78
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,125
I have to let him tell ya.

79
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,875
I don't do violence.

80
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,333
No, Henry, come on. It's not like that.

81
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,750
We'll meet him tomorrow.
He'll tell you all about it.

82
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,041
Have you dyed your hair?

83
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,000
What?

84
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,541
Have you dyed your hair?

85
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,125
Yeah, I just went a bit darker.

86
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,000
It looks good.

87
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,375
Thanks.

88
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,708
Tell him we're on.

89
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,166
Yep.

90
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,750
Great. I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks for the lift.

91
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,416
- Where's Paul?
- He couldn't make it.

92
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,458
Get in.

93
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,125
Get in.

94
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,625
Put your seat belt on.

95
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:44,958
I don't do violence.

96
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,958
No. I've heard.

97
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,541
Fat cunt.

98
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,416
What are we doing here?

99
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:26,791
Wait here.

100
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,916
How you doin', Mark? Good?

101
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,375
Why'd you call me?

102
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,541
Look, I've got your passports ready.

103
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:41,375
They're all clean and unmarked.
And I'm so sorry I couldn't get the money.

104
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,833
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Why?

105
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,375
I tried everything I could.

106
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,583
- But...
- I'll get it for you Tuesday.

107
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,458
By the way,
there's a girl shifting gear around

108
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,291
out of Central Massage.

109
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,250
Who?

110
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,041
You remember Letessia?

111
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,166
- Who?
- Letessia.

112
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,750
Oh, yeah, yeah.

113
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,875
She's dealing out of the rooms.

114
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,125
- Next week, Ken.
- 12:00 sharp?

115
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,250
- What will you do? Thank you.
- Get your money.

116
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,250
No car parks from now on. Fuck.

117
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,041
Shift around gear. Is that it?

118
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,625
No, we don't fuckin' touch it.

119
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,208
You don't use when you work with us, okay?

120
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,708
I've heard that you don't have
many acquaintances, which is good for us.

121
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,750
Works well.

122
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,875
'Cause you don't discuss
this work with anyone.

123
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,458
Open that.

124
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,208
It's blank.

125
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,083
It's just here.

126
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:16,000
You know,
he's in, uh, trouble. Old mate. Paul.

127
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,000
That's why they had to bring him out here.

128
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,458
What's wrong?

129
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,458
If he contacts you and it's not
through me, just let me know.

130
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,125
Don't you go tell Paul
what I said about him.

131
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,208
Where's your place?

132
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,000
Little piece of fluff.

133
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,291
Thanks.

134
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:33,333
One, two, three, four, five.

135
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,083
I'm a sworn member
of the Western Australian Police,

136
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,333
conducting duties
at the Undercover Crimes Unit

137
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,875
in the investigation into
the abduction and murder

138
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,791
of James Liston on the 12th of May, 2002.

139
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,208
Today's date is May 6, 2010.

140
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,000
My CO number is 452

141
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,791
and I'm using the assumed name
of Mark Frame.

142
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,583
<i>Old mate, he called me last night.</i>

143
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,416
<i>I let it go to voicemail
like... like you said.</i>

144
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,833
Uh, he wanted me to, uh,
to collect this, though.

145
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,833
Yeah, I'll take that.

146
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,041
He's at a property
out of town for a while.

147
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,916
What?

148
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,750
I thought I saw a car.

149
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,708
What'd it look like?

150
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,208
Ah, it's a van. It's turned off now.

151
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,791
Hey, just hold on a sec.

152
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,625
All right, Henry?

153
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,000
Have you seen the sea?

154
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:13,750
Hey.

155
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,125
Hey, Gary.

156
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:22,041
This, um, came for Paul yesterday.

157
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,000
Henry.

158
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,458
Come here.

159
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,416
This is Henry Teague.

160
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,750
That's Gary.

161
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,250
You can't come in here dressed like that.

162
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,958
Get yourself some proper clothes.

163
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,666
You look like a fuckin' criminal.

164
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,416
Seriously, sort it out. Sit down.

165
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,458
About Paul.

166
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He has issues in the past
and we have to resettle him.

167
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,958
That creates an opening.

168
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,333
We're a closed group.

169
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,375
We don't often let people in,

170
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,541
and when we do, we take care of our own.

171
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,250
How's that sound to you, Henry?

172
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,375
Yeah, why... Yeah, why not?

173
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,875
Look, Mark. I don't have enough money
to buy new clothes, mate.

174
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:33,500
- I can't fuckin' afford that, you know...
- Ah, mate. Mate, shh, listen. Here. Look.

175
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,125
Yeah, don't worry about it.

176
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,666
I'll look after you.

177
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,583
See?

178
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,125
Wait. I've gotta ask you something.

179
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:53,208
That fella up there, Gary,
all right, he's the head here, okay?

180
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:57,416
But there are people who he answers to
and they answer to people above them.

181
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,333
But he told me to ask you
if you'd done time before.

182
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,708
Yeah, I have, yeah.

183
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,958
Mm-hmm. What for?

184
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:09,208
Been in and out
a few times, nothing serious.

185
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,916
So no longer stints then?

186
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,291
I did time for an assault
up in the NT, okay?

187
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:20,541
That's why no fucking violence, you know,
because of the time for repeat offenders.

188
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,875
If you've done longer stints,
just fuckin' tell me, okay?

189
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,250
Don't wait for me to ask you.
How long for?

190
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,583
Two years.

191
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,333
It was at a family crisis center
and there was this fella

192
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,208
who kept chattin' about my
fuckin' missus all the time.

193
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,250
I went for him.

194
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,541
He ran off into the trees,
I went after him.

195
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,500
Yeah, I don't fuck...
I don't care what you done, okay?

196
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,250
What I care about is
you being honest with me.

197
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,625
Yeah. Be honest with me.

198
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,583
That's all I ask, mate, serious. Here.

199
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,125
Cheers.

200
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,916
What?

201
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,666
Just... Nothin', man. All right.

202
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

203
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,166
Oi!

204
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,500
What did you do?

205
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,500
Get off the fuckin' table. Get...

206
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,041
Here. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

207
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,291
Come here. Sit on the... Stand there.

208
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,750
You've got bare feet.

209
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,875
- What did you do that for?
- I didn't mean it.

210
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,666
Fuckin' hell.

211
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,500
Can you just pay attention?

212
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,625
All right?
If I cut myself, whose fault is it?

213
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:47,916
Fuck.

214
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,458
What are you gonna do next time?

215
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,125
- Clean it up.
- No, pay attention.

216
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,958
All right. Come here.

217
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,083
Listen. Look at me.

218
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,958
Sorry I sweared at you, all right?
Go put your shoes on.

219
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,083
<i>Hey, you want me to
teach you something I learned at work?</i>

220
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,500
<i>Okay, you gotta close your eyes, yeah?</i>

221
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,333
<i>Close your eyes and you gotta breathe in,</i>

222
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,125
<i>and when you breathe in,</i>

223
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,875
<i>you're gonna imagine that
you're breathing in really clear air.</i>

224
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,333
You gonna get out in a sec?

225
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,541
<i>And then when you breathe out, you're...</i>

226
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,666
<i>you're gonna breathe out all the black...</i>

227
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,750
Did you know...

228
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,375
<i>...dark, bad air.</i>

229
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,458
What?

230
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,750
That there's a frog that makes this sound?

231
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,666
<i>And that's all the things
you don't like.</i>

232
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,000
Up top. Oh, don't hurt me.

233
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,541
- I'm not trying to hurt you.
<i>- Like when you're angry...</i>

234
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,125
You're getting it in my beard!

235
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,958
<i>...or when you're scared and stuff.</i>

236
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,791
- Close your eyes. Trust me.
- No.

237
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:10,541
<i>Things you don't like
and then you breathe in the clear air...</i>

238
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,791
<i>...and out the blackness.</i>

239
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,875
There you go.

240
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,458
Your whole body's gonna relax

241
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
from your feet, your knees,
your hips,
your stomach, your chest.

242
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,916
In the clear air...

243
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,208
...out the black...

244
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,208
Do you need a hand?

245
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,166
Sorry.

246
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:38,750
Ah, I'm just fucking with you.
You look good. Come on.

247
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,791
Now he's gonna make me go shopping.

248
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:50,666
Hey.

249
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,458
Shut the fuckin' door.

250
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,833
- What's going on here?
- Sit down.

251
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,625
Hand over your phones.

252
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:02,333
What do you need our phones for?

253
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,333
Unlock them.

254
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,333
What do you need them for?

255
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,916
We're deleting all of Paul's contacts.

256
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:14,083
He's downstairs. Give him this.

257
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,666
John's taken care of everything.

258
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,000
Have a drink with Paul

259
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,208
and then we're taking him to the airport.

260
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:23,375
And you, do whatever Mark tells you to do.

261
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,166
There you fuckin' are.

262
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:33,833
Sit down.

263
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,458
- Hey, Henry.
- How you doing?

264
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,583
All right, there's ten grand in there.

265
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,541
Passport's been issued.

266
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:47,958
Ticket to the UK as well.

267
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,750
And your visa's good for a year.

268
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:56,791
Listen, mate, whatever this is about,
I don't want to know about it.

269
00:23:56,875 --> 00:24:00,083
We don't need to know.
You told John and that's all that matters.

270
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:01,500
Okay?

271
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:05,000
And he reckons it'll all be over
by the time you get back.

272
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:10,625
We've all got a history, mate.
We've all got a past.

273
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,750
And now you're nobody. Woo-hoo.

274
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,125
Cheer up, man.

275
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,625
I'm gonna get us a drink.

276
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:36,916
Henry...

277
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,250
Trust Mark.

278
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,916
Trust Mark. Yeah?

279
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:50,125
If you're honest...
If you're honest with these guys,

280
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,500
you'll be looked after, mate.
You'll be looked after.

281
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:05,833
What are we doing out here?

282
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:08,541
We're making sure that Paul's clean.

283
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,375
Who's John?

284
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,916
He's your employer.

285
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:38,375
Sorry, I can be a bit of a cunt.

286
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:42,333
I've had issues myself in the past.

287
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,583
This is the only family I've ever had.

288
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:52,125
So, listen, if you have any issues,

289
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:56,250
if you need help or what have you,

290
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:58,583
just come out here and you wait,

291
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:01,791
and I'll find you, brother.

292
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:24,041
After the child
was abducted from the underpass,

293
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,875
he was questioned several times
due to his record.

294
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,791
He refused psychological testing.

295
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:33,333
He stated he had a history
of violent of fences.

296
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,708
There's an assault in the NT.

297
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:38,833
Details aren't listed.

298
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:45,916
We've been tasked P28
to reassess for the coronial inquest.

299
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,416
At the time of the abduction,
P28's file was closed

300
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,791
after detectives found
insufficient time or evidence

301
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,333
for him to be considered
a person of interest.

302
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:57,666
He has since relocated
to Western Australia.

303
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,333
We've been tasked with P27.

304
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:07,166
He has a history of assault
and sexual violence.

305
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,208
His movements place him
in the region, the bypass road

306
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,833
on the morning of the 12th of May, 2002.

307
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,250
We're tasked with P26.

308
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:20,000
He has a lengthy history
of domestic assault charges.

309
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:22,541
There are currently four AVOs
ascribed to him.

310
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:42,500
Mark.

311
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:58,166
Thank you for everything
you've done on this case.

312
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:02,458
It's your groundwork got us to this point,
so you should be proud of that.

313
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,541
See you on the other side.

314
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:12,541
Flying back to Queensland?

315
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,500
Hey!

316
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:19,833
We burnt your car.

317
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,833
<i>The decision is we can't have him
in densely populated areas,</i>

318
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,083
<i>so isolate him further.</i>

319
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:37,083
<i>Downside is we can't have
physical surveillance in remote areas,</i>

320
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:39,541
<i>which means you'll be
unprotected and unobserved</i>

321
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,500
<i>apart from the recording equipment.</i>

322
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,875
<i>The whole operation hinges
on you getting closer with him.</i>

323
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:49,291
<i>I know you fuckin' know this.</i>

324
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:52,833
Don't find yourself in terrain
that you're unfamiliar with.

325
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:57,375
Weigh the balance of the closeness you
could form against your own vulnerability.

326
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,375
Fuck!

327
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,666
I said wait in the car.

328
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:35,250
You were taking ages.

329
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:39,625
Could've been one of those silent alarms.

330
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:42,166
Ah, I sorted that ages ago.

331
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:44,375
Here. I forgot your brand.

332
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Here you go.
- Thanks, mate.
- Do you want a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

333
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,916
<i>Do you want a smoke?</i>

334
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,583
<i>Nah. I quit.</i>

335
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:16,041
<i>I couldn't find a job
anywhere before this.</i>

336
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:19,541
<i>You got a criminal record,
you're fucked these days.</i>

337
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,750
<i>My dad was in the Army.</i>

338
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:26,000
<i>Thought about joining the Reserves myself.</i>

339
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,333
<i>I did all the tests.</i>

340
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:32,166
<i>I failed the psych
'cause I fuckin' sleepwalk.</i>

341
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:53,708
<i>Do I look like a monster?</i>

342
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:54,625
What?

343
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:58,166
I can taste with my feet
and hear with my fur.

344
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,625
- What am I?
- What?

345
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:00,958
A moth.

346
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:03,416
You're a pain in the arse,
that's what you are.

347
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:06,375
No, here, here. Here.

348
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,291
All right, mate. See you Thursday.

349
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,666
This is Detective Senior Constable
Kate Rylett

350
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,375
in the presence of Detective
Senior Constable Graham Ikin.

351
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,416
We are carrying out a timing
of the movements

352
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,166
of POI 28, Henry Teague,
on the 12th May, 2002.

353
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:32,125
<i>P28 claims to have left
his home at 2:50 p.m.</i>

354
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:34,375
<i>and returned at 5:30 p.m.</i>

355
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:38,500
<i>He drove along the bypass
towards a relative's house,</i>

356
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:41,208
<i>he parked and collected an engine part.</i>

357
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,166
<i>He returned along the same road,
passing the bus stop at the underpass,</i>

358
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,208
<i>where the victim was last seen
between 4:05 and 4:10 p.m.</i>

359
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:55,000
He claims not to have seen the child,

360
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,666
but places himself driving past

361
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,791
at the same time the child was
observed by other witnesses,

362
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:02,083
including those on a passing bus.

363
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,958
<i>That bus wasn't taking passengers.</i>

364
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,958
<i>It drives through
the underpass at 4:15 p.m.</i>

365
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:14,375
<i>A number of witnesses
on that bus saw the boy.</i>

366
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:16,958
<i>He was waiting by the side of the road</i>

367
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,416
<i>with a man standing behind him,</i>

368
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:22,750
<i>leaning against a pillar of the underpass,</i>

369
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:26,083
<i>his leg bent behind him like a stork.</i>

370
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,791
<i>A second bus passes at 4:18 p.m.</i>

371
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:37,916
There are no sightings of either the boy
or the man from that last bus

372
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,708
which means in those three minutes,

373
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:45,375
between 4:15 to 4:18 p.m., he's taken.

374
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:08,666
<i>He claimed that a camera,
angled at the road,</i>

375
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,083
<i>would've seen his car
driving through the site.</i>

376
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,291
<i>That camera was not operational.</i>

377
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,750
He... He's only placed himself at the scene

378
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,583
because he thinks
he was recorded passing through it.

379
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:26,708
<i>P28 claimed he drove
through the site without stopping,</i>

380
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:29,666
<i>proceeding directly to
the home of an elderly friend</i>

381
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,666
<i>with whom he spent the next half hour.</i>

382
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,166
<i>The alibi no longer resides
at her home address.</i>

383
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:39,625
<i>When asked why
he hadn't raised the alibi earlier,</i>

384
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:43,291
<i>P28 stated it was because
he did not want to upset her.</i>

385
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:48,875
Hello, Mari.

386
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:51,708
How are you today?

387
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,208
What was the period of time
you were hoping to talk to her about?

388
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:00,416
We can't discuss that.

389
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,916
He claimed to have been with her
between 4:10 and 4:45 p.m.,

390
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:09,916
however, she's unable to confirm that.

391
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,333
Forensic investigators
attended his property

392
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:16,500
in the days following

393
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,750
and conducted an examination
of his vehicle.

394
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,750
Tape lifts were taken through
the interior of the car.

395
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:26,333
There's no record of the results here.

396
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:30,666
<i>Senior police considered him
an unlikely suspect regardless,</i>

397
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:34,083
<i>as he did not drive
the "boxy black vehicle"</i>

398
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,500
<i>sighted by multiple witnesses
at the scene.</i>

399
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:38,333
<i>The conclusions were a lack of evidence</i>

400
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:41,458
<i>and insufficient time for him
to have abducted the child</i>

401
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:43,500
<i>and returned home by 5:30</i>

402
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,583
to what he stated he'd been doing.

403
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,666
Which was what?

404
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,000
Cleaning.

405
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:57,625
You know, when I was a kid, I used to ride
the cane trains all the fuckin' time.

406
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,583
Out of my fuckin' head, I was.

407
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:10,583
I never felt more free until now, mate.

408
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:21,083
I reckon this is what
fuckin' real dreams are made of.

409
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,208
You know Paul?

410
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:35,375
When I first met him, I...
I didn't even fuckin' trust him.

411
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:39,166
I thought he was a fuckin'
reporter or something, you know?

412
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:43,291
With all the fuckin' questions
he was asking.

413
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:46,500
That cunt couldn't be a reporter.

414
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:49,166
He can hardly fuckin' read.

415
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:57,958
It's true.

416
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:01,000
He's a fuckin' dumb dummy.

417
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,250
- Done?
- No, not yet.

418
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,625
Hey.

419
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:34,875
This is Henry.

420
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:41,250
Here you go.

421
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,208
Good?

422
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,625
- Yeah, you'll let me know?
- Yep.

423
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,041
So...

424
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,833
Meeting him is a marker of trust.

425
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:57,250
It means you've been brought further in.

426
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:59,875
He's a detective senior sergeant.

427
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:02,916
His influence goes right up
through the ranks.

428
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,666
If you ever see him out,
don't approach him,

429
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,666
don't talk to him.

430
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,541
He's hooked us up with an arms contact.

431
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,458
<i>We've got to go and meet him out of town.</i>

432
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:22,083
Two 1911s,
two Berettas, three Glocks.

433
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:24,000
I can do the lot for, like, 12...

434
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,458
I like firearms.

435
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:44,208
I used to collect them.

436
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,375
Now it's antiques,
little trinkets like this.

437
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:50,458
Oh.

438
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:55,708
Who's Rylett?

439
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,458
- Rylett?
- Mm.

440
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:02,958
Oh. Rylett Holdings. Yeah,
I used to work for them back east.

441
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:08,500
<i>This is Kate Rylett.</i>

442
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:13,250
<i>I'm after any archival video material
related to P28, Henry Teague.</i>

443
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:21,916
<i>What was your relationship?</i>

444
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:24,291
<i>We met through church.</i>

445
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,625
<i>Why have you come forward?</i>

446
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:34,541
<i>Well, I don't...
I don't know about this case, but, um...</i>

447
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:40,041
<i>but if a child's gone missing
and he was in the area, then I...</i>

448
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,208
<i>think that...</i>

449
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:47,250
<i>You think he was involved?</i>

450
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:49,458
<i>Yeah.</i>

451
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:55,041
<i>He drove us into the forest
this one night, um...</i>

452
00:38:56,541 --> 00:39:00,375
<i>And told me to get out
and pretend that I didn't know him.</i>

453
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:02,708
<i>And... and then he's...</i>

454
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:07,791
<i>He's just driven off,
and he's just left me there. Uh...</i>

455
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:11,916
<i>Then he's... He circled back round,</i>

456
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,708
<i>he's pulled over to talk me into the car,</i>

457
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,833
<i>and then when I climbed in, he's...</i>

458
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:19,791
<i>Ugh.</i>

459
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:25,625
<i>He said, "You should...
You should be more careful who you trust."</i>

460
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:29,125
<i>And then what happened?</i>

461
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,375
I used to be
a tow-truck driver, you know?

462
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:42,166
Take the wrecks to... to be destroyed
down at the shredding yard.

463
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:44,750
If you ever needed to,

464
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:47,958
that would be a very good place
to get rid of a body, you know.

465
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,541
If you ever needed to.

466
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:54,125
They don't check the cars?

467
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:55,625
Nah.

468
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
A lot of fuckin' crosses out here, mate.

469
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:07,875
I used to be a member of
the church, back east. Yeah.

470
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:10,833
A charismatic revival.

471
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:12,708
Do you know the type?

472
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:15,500
Yeah.

473
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:18,375
You shake and you flap about.

474
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,375
Then they go into fucking convulsions.

475
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:38,750
Eh.

476
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:42,083
I had a falling out
with the pastor, though.

477
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:46,666
He said there was
no such thing as an unforgivable sin.

478
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:50,916
All sins could be forgiven.

479
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,958
"That's not what it says in the Bible,"
I fuckin' told him.

480
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,791
Standing up there,
preaching things that aren't fuckin' true.

481
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,833
Fuckin' lying.

482
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:09,416
<i>When we get there,
I'll need to go off and meet our contact.</i>

483
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,833
<i>You just hold there at the caravan park</i>

484
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:15,291
<i>till I come back for you.</i>

485
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:23,041
Your recording device failed.
Take this one and hand me yours.

486
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:28,250
You guys, you, you need to
back off further, all right?

487
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,541
You're following way too close.

488
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,083
All right. You all right?

489
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:34,041
You just...

490
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,666
Just... just run me through
the fuckin' scenario.

491
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,291
There's no scenario, mate.

492
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:45,166
Local police were alerted to activity
at the warehouse we planned to use.

493
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,250
We had to clear out.

494
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:49,583
Fuck.

495
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:54,750
Henry!

496
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:55,916
- Buddy.
- Henry!

497
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,666
Got to move out, mate.

498
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,875
Hurry up. Get your shit. Serious.

499
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:01,916
- Quick! Anything else here?
- Yeah.

500
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,375
- No.
- All right.

501
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:30,125
Do you, um...

502
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,583
Do you want to come up to the house?

503
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,416
The missus is out of town at the moment.

504
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:03,791
Nice.

505
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,583
Back in a sec.

506
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:46,500
What does your missus do?

507
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Oh, she...

508
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,875
She suffers with anxiety and depression.

509
00:43:57,625 --> 00:44:00,125
She doesn't really leave
the house that much.

510
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:01,250
Oh, yeah?

511
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:23,125
Bought that with the money
you paid me for the work last week.

512
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:33,708
Where did you grow up?

513
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:36,791
A lot of army bases.

514
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,250
I'm the black sheep of the family, mate.

515
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:51,833
They're ashamed of me.
Can't fuckin' stand me.

516
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,625
Why's that?

517
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:00,041
I don't know.

518
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:09,875
How old are you, Mark?

519
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,083
Forty-six.

520
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:15,000
- Nearly 50, eh?
- Yeah.

521
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:16,625
Old man.

522
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,166
Huh.

523
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:26,750
What kind of music do you listen to, Mark?

524
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:31,333
I don't really... listen to music.

525
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:34,541
How do you mean?

526
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:38,750
Well, I'm not really a song person.

527
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:43,708
Yeah.

528
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,500
Hey, listen, um,

529
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:53,541
there's preparations
for something that's happening,

530
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:58,333
and I've talked about bringing you in.

531
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:01,625
But it would mean travelling out of town,

532
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:04,458
like, interstate, if you're up for it.

533
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:07,750
I'm there, mate. I'm there.

534
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:10,375
Brilliant. All right.

535
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:11,958
I'll let 'em know.

536
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:17,541
It's good to have a friend, Mark,
you know.

537
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:21,083
Someone you can chat to.

538
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:24,375
- Yeah.
- It's been a while.

539
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:30,458
We see through to the other side,
you and me.

540
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:32,166
That's why we get on so well.

541
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,666
Yeah. You're doin' good.

542
00:46:39,916 --> 00:46:41,875
Oh, fuck, I'm tired, man.

543
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:46,416
I have a long drive back.
I'm going to have to head off.

544
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,208
Sorry.

545
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:52,458
Um... It's a nice place.

546
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:53,916
Mark, wait.

547
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:25,416
<i>Hey. What are you fuckin' doing?</i>

548
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:28,541
All right, enough.

549
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:33,958
All right, one time. That's it, all right?

550
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:35,958
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Shake my hand.

551
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:38,125
- Promise.
- All right. okay.

552
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:40,041
I'm gonna... How much do I gotta count?

553
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:41,416
Uh...

554
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,000
- Forty.
- Forty.

555
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:46,125
Thirty? Thirty. I'll count to 30.

556
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:50,250
One, two, three,

557
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:55,375
four, five, six,

558
00:48:56,625 --> 00:49:00,583
seven, eight, nine,

559
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:03,958
ten, eleven...

560
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:13,041
You in here? Huh?

561
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:16,708
Buddy?

562
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:18,666
I'm gonna tickle ya.

563
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,666
I'm gonna getcha!

564
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:26,708
Fuck are you?

565
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,458
Fuck.

566
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:31,208
Mate?

567
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:34,416
Mate, I'm fucking serious!

568
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,458
Call out now if you can hear me.

569
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,750
Mate!

570
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:41,833
Hey, where are you? Mate!

571
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,125
- Mate!
- I'm here!

572
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:50,125
- What are you doing out here?
- You said hide.

573
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:52,041
You cannot come out here.

574
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:54,875
You don't go out here. What did I say?

575
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,583
- Come here.
- You told me to hide.

576
00:49:57,083 --> 00:50:00,208
What did I say?
You don't go outside. Get in the house.

577
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,166
Fucking feel this, cunt.

578
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,416
Feel the wind in me hair.

579
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,166
I can feel the wind in me hair.

580
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,083
What is this fuckin' person doing?

581
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What's the matter with you, you fuck?
Get out there, you fuckin' idiot.
What the fucking matter with you?
Oi! Get the fuck out!
Fuckin' drive, cunt!

582
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,208
Fuck!

583
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:35,583
Fuck.

584
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:36,666
Fuckin' hell.

585
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,833
Fuck.

586
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,458
- <i>Police, fire or ambulance?</i>
- Ambulance.

587
00:50:54,541 --> 00:50:57,625
<i>What's the situation there, sir?
Can you describe it for me?</i>

588
00:50:57,708 --> 00:50:59,333
Uh, car crash.

589
00:50:59,416 --> 00:51:04,208
Uh, corner of Ellery and...
Fuck, I don't know.

590
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:06,958
<i>All right, sir.</i>

591
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:09,458
<i>Can I have your name
and a contact number please?</i>

592
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,083
Fuck.

593
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:14,416
- Henry!
- Sit down here. Sit down.

594
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,416
Yeah.

595
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,125
Henry, come on. We've got to go.

596
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,833
Henry!

597
00:51:29,416 --> 00:51:31,250
Do you want to come up to the house?

598
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:32,625
No, no, no.

599
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:38,000
They're... they're putting
the final pieces in place

600
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:39,750
to fly us across to Victoria.

601
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:42,791
- What?
- What's that noise?

602
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:56,625
They're putting the final...

603
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:58,791
I've never been to Victoria.

604
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:06,625
Okay, I'm just gonna
need you to lay low.

605
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:09,083
That's all...
I'm fuckin' tired, man.

606
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,625
All right? I'll call you later
with the details, okay?

607
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:28,416
No, no.

608
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:39,833
I'm just fuckin' with you.

609
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:41,916
I know.

610
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,375
I know.

611
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:22,875
<i>Are you, um,
dealing with any increased irritability?</i>

612
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:25,041
- Stress?
<i>- Nah.</i>

613
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:27,541
<i>Nothing that
you've perceived in yourself?</i>

614
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:28,583
<i>No.</i>

615
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:30,625
<i>Okay.</i>

616
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,333
<i>Any physical discomfort,
anything likewise?</i>

617
00:53:33,416 --> 00:53:34,333
<i>No.</i>

618
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:38,458
<i>Any symptoms of depression?</i>

619
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:39,458
<i>No.</i>

620
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:40,958
<i>How about anxiety?</i>

621
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:43,125
- Are you feeling anxious?
- No. No.

622
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:47,625
And, um, how about any...
any thoughts of self-harm?

623
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:49,958
No.

624
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:55,041
Look, um, I do have, um, it noted

625
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:57,291
that you are dealing
with some sleep issues.

626
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,333
Might it be linked to
your work with WA Police,

627
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:00,416
or is that more personal?

628
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,500
Nah.

629
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:05,333
More to do with WA Police
or more personal?

630
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:06,541
Neither.

631
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:10,416
Mark, look, the reason that you're here

632
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,291
is I've been told you're being placed
in a difficult work situation.

633
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:16,958
I've been asked to discuss that with you.

634
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:22,208
You know, a person in this profession

635
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:25,125
goes through enough...
goes through enough trauma

636
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:27,041
that the aggregation of that trauma,

637
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:29,291
- the amount of it, is overwhelming.
- Mm-hmm.

638
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,500
There's not always an isolated incident

639
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:33,958
or a situation that...

640
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:36,250
I don't know what you're talking about.

641
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:38,666
If you need to take some time off work,

642
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,875
there will be other people
that can take your shifts.

643
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:50,041
Look, I need to talk to you
about the other night

644
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:51,625
outside the front of my house.

645
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:55,666
- Uh, no, Henry, listen...
- No, Mark, please.

646
00:54:58,375 --> 00:55:00,375
I used to watch a lot of porn, you know?

647
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:03,291
Uh, amputees.

648
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:06,291
That was my thing.

649
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:11,000
You know, people with no...
no arms, no fuckin' legs.

650
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:15,625
I don't know what it is about you, Mark.

651
00:55:17,416 --> 00:55:19,583
You... you remind me of an amputee.

652
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
You keep talking like that,
I'll have to take you down
to the fuckin' watch house.

653
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:30,583
What was that?

654
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,625
Uh... Uh...

655
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:36,500
I've got a black lake in my eye!

656
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

657
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:29,416
<i>You need to know that
I've told them that we cannot replace you.</i>

658
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:32,375
<i>You've been on for five and a half months.</i>

659
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:35,041
We can't replicate that
and we can't undo that work.

660
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:42,291
Flying you down to Melbourne
in the coming days.

661
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,958
Victoria are providing coverts.

662
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:47,041
That'll take the pressure off.

663
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:50,333
We've heard nothing
about the assault in the NT

664
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:54,500
and Forensics have come back
with the test results from his vehicle.

665
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:57,083
The tape lifts they took
were never tested.

666
00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:00,833
They were submitted to the lab
where they were set aside.

667
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:02,708
They tested them yesterday.

668
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:05,583
Testing confirms no physical evidence

669
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:08,000
of any other presence
in the fucking vehicle.

670
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:11,791
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

671
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:16,166
They noted that this,
in and of itself, is not conclusive

672
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:19,541
and that at the time
the tape lifts were taken

673
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:21,500
the person of interest was compliant,

674
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:23,791
cooperative and understanding
of the process.

675
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,458
We have absolutely nothing on him.

676
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:53,833
How's, uh... How's your mum?

677
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,166
She said to not talk about it.

678
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:01,541
Talk about what?

679
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:03,083
How she is.

680
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:11,666
- Hey, mate.
- Yeah?

681
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,750
I'm not gonna be able to
take you for a few days, okay?

682
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:15,666
Okay.

683
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,750
- So you tell your mum?
- Okay.

684
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:28,208
There's a boy out there.

685
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:32,041
Alone.

686
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:35,375
Waiting to be found.

687
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:41,583
And you know what he's saying?

688
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:46,041
"Where am I?"

689
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,583
"Where am I?"

690
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:51,583
"Where the fuck am I?"

691
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:44,083
Henry.

692
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:46,875
I heard this is
your first time in Victoria.

693
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:51,500
Must've done something right
to be sent interstate.

694
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:54,541
We're making a collection from a contact.

695
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:58,291
You're taking it back with you to WA,
that's why you're here.

696
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Mark.

697
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:03,833
Mark!

698
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:06,583
John's here in town.

699
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:24,041
Take this.

700
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,708
- You wait here.
- Hey, Mark.

701
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:29,708
Follow me through here.

702
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:35,000
What the fuck's happened to this shit?

703
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:51,708
Through here, mate. You all right?

704
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,291
Yep.

705
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,416
Victoria have provided John.

706
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:58,583
He'll be leading
the final part of the operation.

707
01:01:58,666 --> 01:02:01,208
But my concern is that
he's too direct for Henry.

708
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:04,166
I need you to talk to him
about Henry's anxiety.

709
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:09,000
So we've gone after him
and we're racing down this corridor

710
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:12,041
and he's locked himself in
so we thought, "Well, all right."

711
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:15,083
"Wait for you to ask
to be nicely let out."

712
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:16,625
John.

713
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:18,708
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

714
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:21,375
Uh, Mark here's been
leading the operation in WA.

715
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:23,000
Be good to talk to him about...

716
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:24,875
Sorry, what was your name again?

717
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:25,791
Mark.

718
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:29,291
Yeah, but that's not
your actual name, is it?

719
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:32,000
I mean they did tell you
not to use your actual name?

720
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:33,291
Yeah.

721
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,916
So what's your real name?

722
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:41,583
What's your name?

723
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:44,166
Well, it's not Mark. That's taken.

724
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:49,166
Sorry. I'm just fucking around with you.
I'm sorry.

725
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:51,625
I'll be with you in a sec.
I've just got to...

726
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,958
So...

727
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:55,333
He's a fuckin' arsehole.

728
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:57,583
We've got him here.

729
01:02:57,666 --> 01:03:00,333
We picked him up,
take him down the hallway...

730
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:05,125
We've been taking out insurance policies,
putting it through our claims officer.

731
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,291
Which puts it in our system...

732
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:09,375
Mark.

733
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:12,041
What do you reckon is in the case?

734
01:03:13,458 --> 01:03:14,916
You just have to trust him.

735
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:20,916
Where is my water?
Where's my water?

736
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,791
Where is my water?

737
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:25,000
Bloody hell!

738
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:28,041
No, no, no, no!

739
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:30,291
- It's him.
- Who?

740
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:31,291
John.

741
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,875
- You all right, Mark?
- Yeah.

742
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:43,875
- Flight sorted?
- Yep.

743
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:46,125
How are you, Henry?

744
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:47,166
Yeah.

745
01:03:48,666 --> 01:03:51,833
It's really... nice to meet you,
John, yeah. Thanks...

746
01:03:51,916 --> 01:03:53,083
I'm not John.

747
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:55,208
He's over there.

748
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:59,458
He wants you to write down
your name and date of birth.

749
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:04,041
Um, yeah.

750
01:04:28,541 --> 01:04:30,541
He said to write down your other name.

751
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:36,583
- My other name?
- Yeah. Your other name.

752
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:22,791
- I changed the name years ago.
- Why didn't you fuckin' tell me?

753
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:24,791
What's he want to know the name for?

754
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:26,500
Why didn't you fuckin' tell me?

755
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:28,875
They'll give your name
to a police contact,

756
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,333
run a background check on you.

757
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,250
We all have to get cleared.
Make sure we won't draw attention.

758
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:36,416
Yeah, yeah,
don't fuckin' worry about it.

759
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,166
I remember sitting where you are,

760
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,500
thinking I'd never be let in
with the shit I'd done.

761
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:42,916
- John wants to see you.
- What?

762
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:45,416
John. He wants to talk to you now.

763
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:04,916
I heard about you. Henry.

764
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:07,541
Whatever your name is.

765
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,208
You've got to be honest with us,
all right?

766
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:13,333
I... Yeah.

767
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:15,833
I changed... I changed the name years...

768
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:17,166
I don't give a fuck.

769
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:19,916
No.

770
01:06:23,666 --> 01:06:25,375
- What are you staring at?
- Nothin'.

771
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:29,708
Then why are you still standing there?

772
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:40,458
Thanks.

773
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:44,291
Right. They've got us in different places.
Don't leave the hotel.

774
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,041
There's nothing else I haven't told you,
apart from the name.

775
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:49,541
- Nothing else I know about, at least.
- All right.

776
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:51,333
Don't leave the hotel, Henry.

777
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:22,666
<i>I met this woman down
in the hotel bar last night.</i>

778
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,916
<i>Brought her back to the room.</i>

779
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:32,791
<i>You know what she told me before she left?</i>

780
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:35,458
Hm.

781
01:07:36,541 --> 01:07:38,458
<i>"I'll never forget you, Henry."</i>

782
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:48,041
Fuckin' hope they've got enough ink
in the printer to print out my record.

783
01:07:48,125 --> 01:07:50,291
Eh, you don't need to worry about it.

784
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:55,000
Ah, there's been nothing
in 20 years, mate.

785
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:26,916
There were no records
of an assault in the NT

786
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,208
under Henry Teague.

787
01:08:28,916 --> 01:08:31,500
They were filed under his
former name, Peter Morley.

788
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,791
I provided them with the information,

789
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:36,750
but it was misfiled.

790
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:40,416
Jesus Christ.

791
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:48,458
<i>I can't, uh,
take your call at the moment.</i>

792
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:52,083
<i>If you leave me a message,
I'll endeavor to call you back later.</i>

793
01:08:58,250 --> 01:08:59,208
Henry?

794
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:03,875
Fuck.

795
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:13,125
- I've lost him.
<i>- What?</i>

796
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:15,875
- I've fuckin' lost him.
<i>- Did he follow you back?</i>

797
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:18,458
Uh, no, I don't know,
but I don't think so.

798
01:09:18,541 --> 01:09:19,458
<i>Fuck!</i>

799
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:22,625
<i>Uh... Listen, Mark.</i>

800
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:26,125
<i>We can't put out an alert. You know that.</i>

801
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:31,041
<i>There... there can't be a follow vehicle.</i>

802
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,708
<i>I can't put out an alert.
You have to try and find him.</i>

803
01:09:33,791 --> 01:09:34,708
What?

804
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:37,166
<i>You're gonna have to
try to find him, mate.</i>

805
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,750
<i>Only issue is the alibi.</i>

806
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:41,708
<i>Her daughter worked at a local RSL
at the time of the abduction.</i>

807
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:44,958
<i>She said her mum was often there,
playing the machines.</i>

808
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:47,833
<i>Don't have security camera
footage dating back to 2002?</i>

809
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,833
Not back that far.

810
01:09:52,416 --> 01:09:54,583
Do you keep records of your sign-in books?

811
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:56,875
If she was a regular,
she wouldn't have to sign.

812
01:09:56,958 --> 01:09:58,750
What do you do for the regulars?

813
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:01,000
We used to have a loyalty program

814
01:10:01,083 --> 01:10:03,125
where members could scan their cards

815
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:05,083
and the machine
would record their numbers.

816
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:06,833
How would we track down...

817
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:08,458
Sorry.

818
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:11,708
<i>They shall not
grow old, as we who are left grow old.</i>

819
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:15,583
<i>Age shall not weary them,
nor the years condemn.</i>

820
01:10:17,916 --> 01:10:20,500
<i>At the going down of the sun
and in the morning,</i>

821
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:21,833
<i>we shall remember them.</i>

822
01:10:21,916 --> 01:10:23,250
We shall remember them.

823
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:25,750
- We shall remember them.
- We shall remember them.

824
01:10:35,458 --> 01:10:38,833
- <i>Lest we forget.</i>
- We'll have her number on file,

825
01:10:38,916 --> 01:10:41,750
- but the machines have been out of use...
- Where are they?

826
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:51,250
What's the date you're after?

827
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:54,500
The 12th May, 2002.

828
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:36,875
<i>I'm sittin' here with
the missus and just had ourselves a roast.</i>

829
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:41,333
<i>She says hello, by the way.</i>

830
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,791
<i>"Hello, Mark," she's saying,
"Hello, Mark."</i>

831
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,333
<i>Tell her I... Tell her I said hi.</i>

832
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:52,000
<i>Mate, where... Where are you?</i>

833
01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:54,083
- Are you okay?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

834
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:57,375
<i>I had to head out of town for a while.</i>

835
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:01,750
<i>Well, why don't I talk
to the boys, we'll work out...</i>

836
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:05,833
Yeah, he's anxious. He's unsettled.

837
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:12,541
At this point, we feel that
we could lose him... at any time.

838
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:16,583
<i>We need to get John out here</i>

839
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:19,166
<i>and prepare to make the final push.</i>

840
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:29,041
<i>The interstate job
was in preparation for a larger shipment.</i>

841
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:32,416
Mark, here,
has put you forward for this, Henry.

842
01:13:33,416 --> 01:13:35,416
And this is just the start, mate.

843
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,833
This is nothing.
This is just a fuckin' run.

844
01:13:37,916 --> 01:13:41,458
It's a remote airfield,
hour-and-a-half out of town.

845
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:45,833
<i>John's concerned about security
and we need you to case the site.</i>

846
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:51,375
<i>When the delivery is made,
you'll take 10% of the profit.</i>

847
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:54,625
<i>To be clear, Henry,
that's over $100,000 each.</i>

848
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:08,458
I've been, uh,
doing the security down here

849
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:11,416
for nearly five years
and, uh, it never gets old.

850
01:14:13,291 --> 01:14:15,666
We're open to the public
on Sundays, by the way.

851
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:18,958
Oh, right, yeah.
I might bring my boys out.

852
01:14:19,041 --> 01:14:20,791
Yeah, you should. They'd enjoy it.

853
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:27,583
You like the look of that, eh?
You want to sit in the front seat?

854
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:32,333
<i>I was 54 when I started.
I learned with my son.</i>

855
01:14:33,166 --> 01:14:36,541
<i>I had a fear of heights,
but, uh, when you get in here,</i>

856
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:37,916
it feels really safe.

857
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:40,458
- Yeah.
- It feels very safe.

858
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:42,125
It does feel safe.

859
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:47,416
How much are these worth?

860
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:51,916
Well, there's, uh, no ceiling
in the price of planes

861
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,375
but, uh, that, um... that plane back there,

862
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:58,583
that's, uh, $60,000.

863
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:16,708
We've disproved his alibi.

864
01:15:16,791 --> 01:15:18,875
She was on the machines at the local RSL.

865
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:21,666
He couldn't have been
with her at the time.

866
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:24,541
Where was he then?

867
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:28,500
Not... not there.

868
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:34,125
Have you seen the records from the NT?

869
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:35,166
I'm reading them.

870
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,500
Follow me, please.

871
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:27,500
Take a seat. There's fine.

872
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:33,291
I'm Detective Sergeant Cross.

873
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,791
I'm the controller for
the Covert and Specialist Operations crew.

874
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:40,333
I'm here to inform you
that at the close of the coronial inquest

875
01:16:40,416 --> 01:16:42,666
there'll be a UC sitting
next to your person of interest

876
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:45,166
on his return to WA. This is Paul Emery.

877
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:47,208
- Hey.
- Hi.

878
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:49,625
The intention will be
for Paul to make contact

879
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:51,333
with the POI on his return trip,

880
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:54,041
see where that takes us
over a two-week period.

881
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:57,000
I'm afraid, unless they decide
to take it further, that's...

882
01:16:58,416 --> 01:16:59,250
That's it.

883
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:02,833
You're here to brief us
about his background.

884
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:05,000
- Right. But he did it.
- Mm.

885
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:12,416
And I know they've probably told
you he isn't worth the effort,

886
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:15,083
but he did it.

887
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:19,125
Well,
we've only just been allocated this.

888
01:17:20,583 --> 01:17:22,875
Tell us what we can use
to get him to talk.

889
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:25,916
<i>Is this Peter Morley?</i>

890
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:27,541
<i>No.</i>

891
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:31,166
Is this Peter Morley,
otherwise known as Henry Peter Teague?

892
01:17:32,666 --> 01:17:34,083
<i>Who's this?</i>

893
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:35,375
My name's Kate Rylett.

894
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:38,791
I'm a detective senior constable
in Queensland.

895
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:42,000
<i>As the detectives would've informed you,</i>

896
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:46,250
<i>you've been summonsed to appear
at a coronial inquest in Queensland...</i>

897
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:47,250
Henry Teague.

898
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:52,166
<i>...into the suspected abduction
and murder of James Liston in 2002.</i>

899
01:17:53,666 --> 01:17:55,583
<i>I'm going to give you my phone number.</i>

900
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:58,791
<i>I'll be your point of contact
from here on.</i>

901
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:00,541
<i>And what if I refuse to come?</i>

902
01:18:00,625 --> 01:18:02,125
<i>If you don't want to come,</i>

903
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:04,958
<i>the Queensland coroner
will issue a warrant</i>

904
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:08,625
<i>for you to be taken into custody
and brought before the inquest.</i>

905
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,375
<i>After the inquest,
we'll provide you with transport,</i>

906
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:17,708
<i>as I understand that
you currently live in Western Australia.</i>

907
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,375
<i>We'll ensure you're returned
to your place of residence,</i>

908
01:18:22,208 --> 01:18:24,583
<i>assuming you aren't required
to remain in Queensland</i>

909
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,083
<i>at the close of the process.</i>

910
01:18:44,583 --> 01:18:48,166
<i>We've reviewed the brief
of evidence prepared by Detective Rylett.</i>

911
01:18:50,916 --> 01:18:52,083
Paul Emery?

912
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:54,916
And we can see reason
to invest WA Pol resources

913
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,458
in your person of interest.

914
01:18:56,916 --> 01:18:59,500
You'll remain here as a controller,
work with us on this.

915
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:03,541
We're initiating an operation
that would mean introducing Mark here

916
01:19:03,625 --> 01:19:09,083
as part of a criminal organization that
can relocate people, erase histories...

917
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:11,833
<i>...offer him a way out.</i>

918
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:16,833
<i>It's dark.</i>

919
01:19:22,416 --> 01:19:24,083
I step out the front of my house.

920
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:32,583
And I get this feeling
of lightness come over me.

921
01:19:34,166 --> 01:19:35,625
So I start to run.

922
01:19:36,666 --> 01:19:38,125
And then I'm up in the air

923
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:42,041
and I'm flying over the back fences
and the houses that I grew up in.

924
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:49,041
Fixed-wing licence costs $10,000.

925
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:53,791
Two $5,000 payments.
Hey, figure how useful I'd be, Mark.

926
01:19:53,875 --> 01:19:56,416
I... I could be landing on airstrips

927
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,958
all over the country, you know,
making deliveries.

928
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:05,541
Yeah?

929
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,166
All right. We'll head over
to the airfield after that.

930
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
We're going to go meet him out of town.

931
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:37,958
Henry.

932
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:40,125
Mark.

933
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:42,333
- All right?
- Yeah, good.

934
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:45,041
There's a car to be ditched.
Police have eyes on it.

935
01:20:45,125 --> 01:20:47,041
Make sure it's not parked where it is.

936
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:48,458
I'll send you the details.

937
01:20:49,375 --> 01:20:52,208
Henry, there's, um...
I don't know if you're aware of this,

938
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:54,750
but there's a subpoena
that's been issued for you.

939
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:57,000
Nah.

940
01:20:57,083 --> 01:20:59,041
Yeah. Queensland Coroners Court.

941
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:00,250
Are you aware of that?

942
01:21:01,791 --> 01:21:04,208
No, that's done. I went through that.

943
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:06,125
No. This is different.

944
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:11,000
Another inquest, is it?

945
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:14,541
Yeah, apparently they have
some new information.

946
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:41,125
- Can't let you hold on to that.
- Yep.

947
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Thanks.

948
01:21:46,083 --> 01:21:48,375
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's it.

949
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:01,041
What was that about?

950
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:04,916
Uh... I was in the same area
when this person went missing.

951
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:08,666
Police harassed me for it at the time.
Nothing came of it, so...

952
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:17,625
How many times have I told you...

953
01:22:17,708 --> 01:22:21,208
If I'd known there could've been
another subpoena, I would've told you.

954
01:22:24,666 --> 01:22:25,666
What?

955
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:28,375
Yeah. I am.

956
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:30,916
What?

957
01:22:34,541 --> 01:22:35,416
Now?

958
01:22:38,416 --> 01:22:39,375
All right.

959
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:42,541
Yeah, fuckin' all right. I'm doing it now.

960
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,208
What is it?

961
01:22:46,166 --> 01:22:47,500
I've got to turn around.

962
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:48,416
Why?

963
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:52,791
The airfield is, uh, not on tonight.

964
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:55,125
John's in town.

965
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:57,916
We're gonna go, um...
We're gonna go see him.

966
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,791
It's probably about the airfield.

967
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:02,583
Could be about the inquest.

968
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:04,041
Huh?

969
01:23:05,041 --> 01:23:06,750
It could be about the inquest.

970
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:08,916
I really don't fuckin' know.

971
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:18,625
Okay. Well done.
And I'll give you a call this afternoon.

972
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:20,500
- All right. Take care.
- Hey.

973
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:22,291
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

974
01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:23,750
- How you doin'?
- Good, good.

975
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,458
- Uh, Henry, John. John, Henry.
- Yeah.

976
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,416
- Good?
- You remember Henry?

977
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,500
- All good?
- Yep.

978
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:32,625
-All right
-Cool.

979
01:24:33,791 --> 01:24:35,166
- Take a seat.
- Yep.

980
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:37,708
Yeah. Grab yourself a seat. There, there.

981
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:39,708
Park yourself up the end there, Henry.

982
01:24:50,791 --> 01:24:53,625
So, I, uh, actually need to

983
01:24:54,625 --> 01:24:58,916
talk to you about this inquest
that you've heard told of...

984
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:01,458
Heard tell of.

985
01:25:02,416 --> 01:25:05,250
I just need to... to sort that out.

986
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:09,250
Yeah, uh...

987
01:25:11,166 --> 01:25:12,583
Got a criminal history.

988
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:15,166
Stealing, uh, bit of violence.

989
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:17,541
Fuckin' hell.

990
01:25:17,625 --> 01:25:19,416
Uh... Hey, uh, let me...

991
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,500
- Yeah, John, let me...
- Fuck's sake.

992
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:23,291
Yeah, I'll sort it out. Hold on.

993
01:25:26,125 --> 01:25:27,041
I've got it.

994
01:25:35,583 --> 01:25:38,166
I... I did time for the violence, you know?

995
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:40,416
I was upfront with Mark about that.

996
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,833
- Wasn't I, mate?
- Yeah, absolutely.

997
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,208
And I was questioned about
the other thing at the time.

998
01:25:47,916 --> 01:25:49,041
There we are.

999
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:51,250
Nothing came of it.

1000
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:53,333
Sorry about that.

1001
01:26:01,416 --> 01:26:02,583
Excuse us a minute.

1002
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,625
Where's he gone?

1003
01:26:24,833 --> 01:26:26,125
I don't know.

1004
01:26:29,666 --> 01:26:30,916
I'm gonna go

1005
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:33,250
see what's going on.

1006
01:26:41,958 --> 01:26:42,833
John.

1007
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:46,625
You okay, mate?

1008
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:50,500
Wait outside. Wait in the hall.
I'll call you later.

1009
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:53,666
Hey, we're, um...

1010
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:56,708
- I should... I should be here.
- Mark. Fuck off.

1011
01:26:59,583 --> 01:27:00,750
Yeah. Yep.

1012
01:27:07,166 --> 01:27:08,083
Mm.

1013
01:27:09,541 --> 01:27:11,666
Yeah, all right, then. Um...

1014
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,208
I'll see what he says.
I'll give him a call then.

1015
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:16,458
I'll be right back.

1016
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:36,791
Fuck! Fuck!

1017
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:43,708
What's going on?

1018
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:46,041
He's fuckin' falling to pieces
in there. Fuck!

1019
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:49,125
Fuck. Hey, hey.

1020
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:51,916
- <i>...who tell me...</i>
- Fuck.

1021
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,041
<i>- ...that you're the one who's responsible...</i>
- Fuck.

1022
01:27:55,875 --> 01:27:59,625
<i>...so you have to tell me
what we need to take care of.</i>

1023
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:00,833
<i>Nothin' to tell.</i>

1024
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:06,625
<i>Okay.
What falls on you falls on all of us.</i>

1025
01:28:07,708 --> 01:28:08,625
<i>All right?</i>

1026
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:14,500
So I received information this morning

1027
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:19,791
that says you're the one... who's done it.

1028
01:28:21,208 --> 01:28:23,958
And I... I don't care what you've done,

1029
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:27,958
whether you done him
or killed him or what have you.

1030
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:31,500
I mean, there's...
there's nothing you can tell me

1031
01:28:31,583 --> 01:28:32,708
that's gonna upset me.

1032
01:28:34,166 --> 01:28:36,416
What I care about is being lied to.

1033
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:38,208
I'm not lying.

1034
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:40,791
You've had every opportunity
to be upfront with us.

1035
01:28:41,666 --> 01:28:42,916
And if you're gonna...

1036
01:28:44,625 --> 01:28:47,708
be dishonest in front of me
and say you had nothin' to do with it,

1037
01:28:47,833 --> 01:28:49,708
- that's not what I've heard.
- Yeah.

1038
01:28:50,583 --> 01:28:55,541
And I'd have no choice but to cut you out
and you'd be back to nothing.

1039
01:28:58,916 --> 01:28:59,916
Yep.

1040
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:01,333
Yeah.

1041
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:06,916
And if they put you away for this,
there's nothin' I can do.

1042
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,750
And there's a...
There's a stigma, there's a...

1043
01:29:10,583 --> 01:29:13,166
there's a... a stigma about
this kind of thing inside.

1044
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:18,500
So, you know, I can create alibis,

1045
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:21,375
clear the site,
remove evidence, relocate you.

1046
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:22,750
I mean, you've seen that.

1047
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:27,541
All right.

1048
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:34,083
Sorry. Henry, what was that?

1049
01:29:44,916 --> 01:29:46,791
<i>I killed him. I killed the boy.</i>

1050
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:49,291
Jesus Christ. Fuck yes!

1051
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:51,041
<i>Well, you know,</i>

1052
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,791
<i>you're gonna have to take me through it</i>

1053
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:57,291
<i>'cause we need to know
what we have to take care of.</i>

1054
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:05,208
<i>Uh...</i>

1055
01:30:06,916 --> 01:30:07,916
<i>Uh...</i>

1056
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:10,333
<i>I saw him waiting at the underpass,</i>

1057
01:30:10,416 --> 01:30:13,541
<i>so I pulled the car over,
and started to chat to him for a while</i>

1058
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:15,500
<i>and I talked him into the car.</i>

1059
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:19,333
<i>Cops have taken the car, searched it,</i>

1060
01:30:19,416 --> 01:30:20,583
<i>came back with nothin'.</i>

1061
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:23,166
<i>They haven't found the body, obviously.</i>

1062
01:30:23,916 --> 01:30:26,458
<i>And where did this happen?</i>

1063
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:27,958
<i>Just, um...</i>

1064
01:30:38,916 --> 01:30:39,875
What happened?

1065
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,958
John said we've got to go and fuckin'

1066
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:46,208
wait there in my fuckin' car.

1067
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:48,666
What? What is it?

1068
01:30:49,166 --> 01:30:51,666
Nothin'. I don't know. Fuck. Uh...

1069
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,125
Just put the work on hold
for a while or something, um,

1070
01:30:55,208 --> 01:30:56,833
while he sorts a few things out.

1071
01:30:56,916 --> 01:30:59,458
- You told him about the airfield?
- Yeah.

1072
01:31:00,375 --> 01:31:03,125
Look, I don't know how much
I can tell you, man, all right?

1073
01:31:08,666 --> 01:31:10,916
<i>He was dead before anyone
knew he was missing.</i>

1074
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:13,833
Before the police were called.

1075
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:17,333
Before his family even
started looking, he was dead.

1076
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:22,166
Detectives will regroup in Queensland
to determine if arrest will be made.

1077
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:27,458
<i>The undercover operation will continue
with Detective Sergeant Cross</i>

1078
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:30,166
<i>to return the suspect
to the scene of the of fence.</i>

1079
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:35,583
<i>The site itself will need to be contained
in preparation for a search for evidence.</i>

1080
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:40,000
<i>Henry,
I'm what's referred to as a cleaner.</i>

1081
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:43,958
<i>The organization's brought me in
to ensure the police can find nothing</i>

1082
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:46,666
that could be brought against
you at this new inquest.

1083
01:31:47,166 --> 01:31:50,375
So talk me through it all
and I'll decide the right course for us.

1084
01:31:50,458 --> 01:31:53,125
I read all the press
and reports and that.

1085
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:56,416
It wasn't a black car,
it wasn't two... two men.

1086
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:57,875
I was on me own.

1087
01:31:57,958 --> 01:32:01,166
I didn't park at the overpass,
I parked behind it at my old church.

1088
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,958
It happened in an old demountable.

1089
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:04,333
Uh...

1090
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:07,333
So here, it's, uh,
about an hour and a half

1091
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:09,458
north of the city, out in the mountains.

1092
01:32:09,541 --> 01:32:12,291
- It was an old forestry site.
- Where is the demountable?

1093
01:32:14,125 --> 01:32:17,333
Uh, they took it away when...
when they closed the site.

1094
01:32:20,166 --> 01:32:21,541
There's nothin' in it, so...

1095
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:23,375
Couldn't there be traces in there?

1096
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,166
No.

1097
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,250
All right.

1098
01:32:31,041 --> 01:32:32,875
Well, what happened after he, um...

1099
01:32:35,166 --> 01:32:36,375
after he died?

1100
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:40,791
I took him out a bit further, you know,
covered him up with grass, branches,

1101
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:41,833
that sort of thing.

1102
01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:45,375
Left him there, went back about a week
or two later and he was almost gone.

1103
01:32:45,458 --> 01:32:46,458
What do you mean?

1104
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:50,291
There were just little pieces of him.

1105
01:32:50,791 --> 01:32:52,666
No. No, we have to find everything.

1106
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:53,916
What about his clothes?

1107
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,458
I threw them in the creek.

1108
01:32:55,541 --> 01:32:58,000
- How long ago was this?
- About eight years now.

1109
01:32:58,083 --> 01:32:59,833
Why did you take his clothes off?

1110
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:02,541
I don't know, Mark.

1111
01:33:04,041 --> 01:33:05,875
I suppose you had to get rid of 'em.

1112
01:33:12,666 --> 01:33:14,041
What have you done then?

1113
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:15,375
I went home.

1114
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:18,125
How'd you do it?

1115
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,958
- How do you mean?
- How'd you kill him?

1116
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:25,041
- I put my arm around his neck.
- Right. Show us on Mark.

1117
01:33:25,125 --> 01:33:29,166
Mark, can you just pop yourself down
and we'll take a look at that.

1118
01:33:36,166 --> 01:33:37,875
All right.

1119
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:58,583
All right. Yeah. It doesn't matter.

1120
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:01,708
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1121
01:34:02,541 --> 01:34:03,791
Yeah.

1122
01:34:11,416 --> 01:34:13,500
- You need to take us there.
- Yeah.

1123
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:15,666
- Need to clear everything.
- Can Mark come?

1124
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:16,916
- Yeah.
- Ah.

1125
01:34:17,666 --> 01:34:20,666
It doesn't matter where we sit
as long as we're fuckin' together.

1126
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,875
Like, you know, the same fuckin' row.

1127
01:34:24,958 --> 01:34:27,208
So the flight is sorted.

1128
01:34:28,083 --> 01:34:31,458
Uh, well, he'll call me in five
but I'm gonna go sort the car out.

1129
01:34:33,416 --> 01:34:34,291
Hey.

1130
01:34:35,541 --> 01:34:36,583
Henry.

1131
01:34:37,291 --> 01:34:38,833
Um, I'm gonna...

1132
01:34:39,916 --> 01:34:42,041
Mate, I'm... I'm... Come here.

1133
01:34:42,916 --> 01:34:45,791
Come here, mate. Fuck.
I'm just...

1134
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:50,166
I'm so proud of you, brother.

1135
01:34:52,208 --> 01:34:53,375
Yeah.

1136
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,416
<i>This briefing
has been called to determine</i>

1137
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:18,041
<i>whether an arrest
should be made of Peter Morley,</i>

1138
01:35:18,125 --> 01:35:20,208
<i>otherwise known as Henry Peter Teague,</i>

1139
01:35:20,291 --> 01:35:22,916
in the abduction and murder
of James Liston,

1140
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,833
eight years ago on the 12th of May, 2002.

1141
01:35:28,333 --> 01:35:29,541
<i>As you're all aware,</i>

1142
01:35:29,625 --> 01:35:33,000
<i>this is the largest missing-persons case
in the history of our state</i>

1143
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:36,083
<i>and is one of the largest
in the history of our country.</i>

1144
01:35:36,166 --> 01:35:38,125
I'm going to the bathroom.

1145
01:35:38,666 --> 01:35:41,166
<i>The investigation has
spanned over eight years</i>

1146
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:43,416
<i>and is one of the largest joint operations</i>

1147
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:46,333
<i>ever undertaken by interstate agencies.</i>

1148
01:35:46,416 --> 01:35:50,250
Peter Morley was born to a normal,
middle-class military family.

1149
01:35:51,166 --> 01:35:56,125
There is no evidence to suggest as a child
Peter Morley was the subject of abuse.

1150
01:36:02,583 --> 01:36:05,666
<i>This investigation
has completely disproved Morley's alibi...</i>

1151
01:36:06,416 --> 01:36:08,000
He's just gone to the bathroom.

1152
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:10,458
<i>...and has
unearthed the full details</i>

1153
01:36:10,541 --> 01:36:14,083
<i>of his previous assault of a child
in the Northern Territory</i>

1154
01:36:14,166 --> 01:36:16,291
<i>for which he served two years in jail.</i>

1155
01:36:17,791 --> 01:36:18,791
Lights, please.

1156
01:36:23,708 --> 01:36:28,958
This child was taken from
a family crisis center in the NT in 1996.

1157
01:36:30,166 --> 01:36:31,833
He was not known to the offender.

1158
01:36:33,708 --> 01:36:35,791
Attending doctors observed that the child

1159
01:36:35,875 --> 01:36:41,041
had lacerations and abrasions
to his legs, arms and torso.

1160
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:46,250
His hair, face and body
were covered in dirt,

1161
01:36:47,125 --> 01:36:49,375
with blood present in the nose and mouth.

1162
01:36:50,583 --> 01:36:52,166
He had blackened eyes,

1163
01:36:53,416 --> 01:36:54,916
several closed fractures,

1164
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:57,041
a collapsed lung,

1165
01:36:58,291 --> 01:37:00,416
severe bruises beneath his hairline,

1166
01:37:02,166 --> 01:37:04,583
and deep cuts to his scalp and genitalia.

1167
01:37:06,625 --> 01:37:10,541
The overall pattern indicated
widespread and repeated applications

1168
01:37:11,041 --> 01:37:14,541
of both blunt and sharp-force trauma.

1169
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:18,375
Contusions to the throat

1170
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:21,250
in association with
hemorrhaging in the eyes

1171
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:22,958
was indicative of suffocation.

1172
01:37:24,083 --> 01:37:27,916
He was found barely alive
in the remnants of a burnt-out car

1173
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,333
less than 100 meters
from where he was taken.

1174
01:37:32,458 --> 01:37:34,583
On returning to the site of the abduction,

1175
01:37:34,666 --> 01:37:38,583
Peter Morley offered to lead the search
for the person responsible.

1176
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,125
Hello?

1177
01:37:43,375 --> 01:37:44,958
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1178
01:37:45,666 --> 01:37:46,916
- Sorry.
- Nah.

1179
01:37:53,458 --> 01:37:54,666
Thought you'd fallen in.

1180
01:37:57,916 --> 01:38:00,625
I can't fuckin' breathe, man.
I can't fuckin' breathe.

1181
01:38:01,583 --> 01:38:02,583
- Yeah, you can.
- Nah.

1182
01:38:02,666 --> 01:38:03,541
Yeah, you can.

1183
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:06,291
Ready?

1184
01:38:10,958 --> 01:38:12,833
I want to
raise a few issues here.

1185
01:38:12,916 --> 01:38:14,875
Regardless of his assault
on this other child,

1186
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:16,833
in this case, the time lines are thin,

1187
01:38:17,708 --> 01:38:19,375
even with the break in his alibi.

1188
01:38:19,458 --> 01:38:23,333
We're talking about an hour
to abduct a person...

1189
01:38:23,416 --> 01:38:25,583
I have to be clear,
this is a practiced offender

1190
01:38:25,666 --> 01:38:28,541
- who's placed himself at the scene...
- You've been clear.

1191
01:38:28,625 --> 01:38:31,708
- You've had your time. Now sit down.
- I want to clarify something.

1192
01:38:31,791 --> 01:38:33,541
Let's have some contention in the process.

1193
01:38:33,625 --> 01:38:36,958
I want to clarify something.
The duration of the assault in the NT?

1194
01:38:39,125 --> 01:38:40,333
Fifteen minutes.

1195
01:38:45,833 --> 01:38:48,916
There's never been anyone
locked up in Queensland without a body.

1196
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,083
New South Wales there has. Not here.

1197
01:38:51,166 --> 01:38:56,000
I, um... I mentioned the yard
where you talked about shredding the cars.

1198
01:38:56,416 --> 01:38:58,625
Is that somewhere that we should head to?

1199
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:01,291
- Nah, mate.
- I just thought maybe...

1200
01:39:01,375 --> 01:39:02,458
No, Mark, no.

1201
01:39:05,333 --> 01:39:07,000
What were you wearing on the day?

1202
01:39:07,083 --> 01:39:10,083
I threw it all on the fire,
burnt it all, shoes as well.

1203
01:39:11,041 --> 01:39:13,750
- There's nothing left?
- Nothing left. Nothing.

1204
01:39:13,833 --> 01:39:16,750
- Where are the ashes?
- I threw them out on the lawn

1205
01:39:16,833 --> 01:39:19,458
and then I got the dirt
ripped up and taken away, so...

1206
01:39:19,541 --> 01:39:21,000
Fuckin' well done.

1207
01:39:21,083 --> 01:39:23,083
That's gold. Fuckin' gold.

1208
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:26,708
I didn't mean to do it, though.
I didn't know it would happen.

1209
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:29,291
It's like how the words
are coming out of me mouth now,

1210
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:31,750
like how I'm saying it to you now,
like it's nothing.

1211
01:39:34,625 --> 01:39:37,000
- How far from here?
- Not far.

1212
01:39:37,916 --> 01:39:39,541
That's my old church there.

1213
01:39:39,625 --> 01:39:41,000
That's where I was married.

1214
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:44,083
Don't know what I was fuckin'
thinkin' of at the time.

1215
01:39:45,166 --> 01:39:46,208
Yeah.

1216
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:48,625
This is where I picked him up, here.

1217
01:39:49,791 --> 01:39:52,750
No, don't fuckin' pull over.
There's a camera there.

1218
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:54,458
There's a camera there, mate.

1219
01:39:54,541 --> 01:39:55,625
Just keep going.

1220
01:39:59,375 --> 01:40:01,708
<i>This isn't
about whether he did it.</i>

1221
01:40:01,791 --> 01:40:04,500
<i>It's about whether
or not it's prosecutable.</i>

1222
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:08,250
And you can talk about
an unsolicited confession all you like.

1223
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:12,041
This undercover operation
induces a suspect to confess.

1224
01:40:12,916 --> 01:40:15,541
It's inducement without evidence.

1225
01:40:17,041 --> 01:40:19,166
This is where I threw his clothes.

1226
01:40:20,625 --> 01:40:22,041
There's nothing here.

1227
01:40:24,458 --> 01:40:25,375
That's good.

1228
01:40:27,791 --> 01:40:30,500
I strongly submit that we
continue the covert operation

1229
01:40:30,583 --> 01:40:32,166
while the area's being searched

1230
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:34,625
because if you go for
an arrest without evidence

1231
01:40:34,708 --> 01:40:36,666
and you find nothing, he walks.

1232
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:41,125
I refuse to put the victim's family
through that for nothing.

1233
01:40:41,208 --> 01:40:43,666
As you're aware,
the commissioner has tasked me

1234
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:46,875
with making a decision as to whether
or not an arrest is to take place.

1235
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:48,541
Without evidence, he walks.

1236
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:52,000
And that will be
my decision to make.

1237
01:41:03,708 --> 01:41:05,250
Just pull in up there.

1238
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Is this it?

1239
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:18,958
Yep.

1240
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:31,000
So this is where
the demountable was?

1241
01:41:32,875 --> 01:41:35,000
- Yeah.
- So you killed him in there...

1242
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:39,333
and you dragged him down where?

1243
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:23,833
I don't remember that water being there.

1244
01:42:27,291 --> 01:42:28,500
It was here though.

1245
01:42:30,333 --> 01:42:31,333
Here.

1246
01:42:34,875 --> 01:42:35,833
You sure?

1247
01:42:45,583 --> 01:42:46,875
Yeah, there's nothing.

1248
01:43:03,416 --> 01:43:04,583
It's all right.

1249
01:43:07,208 --> 01:43:08,208
It's all right.

1250
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,708
<i>Hold it there!
Hold it there!</i>

1251
01:43:13,791 --> 01:43:16,250
<i>Stay where you are, mate!
Just stay where you are!</i>

1252
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:34,208
Thank you all for your attendance.

1253
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,750
I'll let you know at the outset that
we won't be able to answer any questions.

1254
01:44:39,833 --> 01:44:42,208
<i>I can confirm that earlier today,
an arrest was made</i>

1255
01:44:42,291 --> 01:44:46,041
<i>in relation to the disappearance
of James Liston on May 12, 2002.</i>

1256
01:44:46,125 --> 01:44:50,208
<i>Police are currently securing a large area
in anticipation of an extensive search.</i>

1257
01:44:57,791 --> 01:45:01,500
<i>The search area itself
is located in the Queensland floodplain.</i>

1258
01:45:01,583 --> 01:45:05,416
<i>The issue that we are facing
is that flooding over the past eight years</i>

1259
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,625
<i>may have removed any remaining evidence.</i>

1260
01:45:16,541 --> 01:45:17,833
Henry Teague.

1261
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,458
As informed earlier,

1262
01:45:20,541 --> 01:45:23,500
you're here under arrest with regard
to the abduction of James Liston

1263
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:24,750
on the 12th May, 2002.

1264
01:45:24,833 --> 01:45:27,875
I haven't done this, you know.
Nothin' to do with me, mate.

1265
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:30,708
As long as you didn't do it,
there'll be no evidence

1266
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:32,958
and you've got nothing to worry about.

1267
01:45:33,041 --> 01:45:35,500
Now, you got a minute.
Anything you need?

1268
01:45:36,583 --> 01:45:37,791
Anyone got a smoke?

1269
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:26,666
<i>We'll be undertaking
a basic search of the forest covering.</i>

1270
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:29,416
<i>We have around four acres to manage.</i>

1271
01:46:38,541 --> 01:46:41,083
<i>Additional Forensics are
searching the demountable</i>

1272
01:46:41,166 --> 01:46:43,333
<i>which was relocated when the site sold</i>

1273
01:46:43,416 --> 01:46:45,916
<i>and where it's alleged
that the victim was killed.</i>

1274
01:46:52,416 --> 01:46:54,416
<i>Don't disturb potential evidence.</i>

1275
01:46:55,208 --> 01:46:59,625
If you come across anything,
pause and raise your hand.

1276
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:14,958
- How we looking?
- Found nothing.

1277
01:48:15,041 --> 01:48:16,125
- Nothing at all?
- No.

1278
01:48:16,208 --> 01:48:18,708
The divers have finished with
the lake, but no, nothing.

1279
01:48:18,791 --> 01:48:19,791
Right.

1280
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:13,666
No, hold on.

1281
01:51:34,875 --> 01:51:36,083
<i>It's night.</i>

1282
01:51:38,083 --> 01:51:39,416
<i>I'm in my house.</i>

1283
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:43,500
<i>My son is asleep in his room.</i>

1284
01:51:46,125 --> 01:51:47,541
<i>And I hear a voice.</i>

1285
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:51,416
<i>It's coming from downstairs.</i>

1286
01:51:53,958 --> 01:51:55,250
<i>I walk toward it.</i>

1287
01:51:58,333 --> 01:51:59,750
<i>I can barely breathe.</i>

1288
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:04,375
<i>It's not a person talking.</i>

1289
01:52:06,583 --> 01:52:08,375
<i>It's a tape recorder.</i>

1290
01:52:11,166 --> 01:52:13,208
<i>I press the button to turn it off.</i>

1291
01:52:15,083 --> 01:52:16,541
<i>But when I turn it off...</i>

1292
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:20,375
<i>the voice keeps coming...</i>

1293
01:52:23,041 --> 01:52:24,208
<i>...keeps talking.</i>
