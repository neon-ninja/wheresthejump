00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,708
(fast beating drums)

25
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,708
- [Woman] And what
was your last job?

26
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:46,208
- Well I've kinda just done
odds and ends to get by,

27
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,500
you know, waitress and cleaning.

28
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,417
I just really would like
a job doing something

29
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:57,792
where I could feel like I
was doing something good.

30
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,458
- This is our training room.

31
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,417
We don't get to use it that
often but it's great to have

32
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:02,875
when we get to use it.

33
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,458
We help support individuals
with disabilities

34
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,750
in the community to
live in their homes

35
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,083
and have lives just
like you and I .

36
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,875
And here's our kitchen where
the DSP stores their food

37
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,417
and prepares their lunches.

38
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:16,875
The hours are kind of crazy.

39
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,792
You come in and
work two days on.

40
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,333
Then you come back
and work two nights on

41
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,458
and you have to stay
awake all night.

42
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,792
- I don't sleep much
anyway so that'll be fine.

43
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,708
- This is the area they come
in if they want to do puzzles

44
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,042
or whatnot.

45
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,625
And this is Patricia.

46
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,583
- Hi.

47
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,125

hi to my friend, Katie?

50
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,042

my friend, Katie?

00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,417

00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:49,625
- Good

54
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,792
- You guys said hi
to my friend Katie?

55
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:51,875

56
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,292

57
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,542

ready to eat okay.

00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:04,958
This is Jeffrey.

61
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,125

63
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,000
- Yeah.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,833
- And this is Stephanie.

65
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,458
- Hi Stephanie.

66
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,083
- Hi Stephanie this
is my friend, Katie.

67
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,833

working in your home.

68
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:15,667
- Hi.

69
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,000

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,125

00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,083

00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,083

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,375
- This is Katie she's gonna

76
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,875
- Look at that pretty coloring.

77
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:32,958
What are you coloring?

78
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:36,667
Are you coloring?

79
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:37,542
What's that?

80
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:39,500
That's pretty

81
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:41,625
- And this is Brandy.

82
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,583
She's gonna be who
you're following

83
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,625
for the next few days.

84
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,583

I'm gonna go up I've got
some things I need to do.

87
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,958
- Sure.

88
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:50,833
- Thank you.

89
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:55,167
- So this is our room
we use for the clients,

90
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:57,208
for the jobs they train in here

91
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,542
so that they're all out for
the day right now, though.

92
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:01,417
- Okay.

93
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:06,792
- Our computer room

94
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,833
and stuff like that in here.

95
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,000
A lot of employees
just gossip mainly.

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,542
- (laughs)

97
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:14,417
- we use this area over
here for our planner outings

98
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,417
in the morning.

99
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,417
That's what are they.
- okay

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,875
- Puzzles. They love
working on puzzles.

101
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:22,708
- Pretty

102
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,042
- We usually hang them
up but we got a couple

103
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:26,917
that rip them off the walls.

104
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,542
- (laughing)

105
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:29,917
- They get tired they can
rest in there or whatever.

106
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:31,083
- Okay.

107
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,708

108
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,375
what the doctor prescribes
all health information.

109
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,750
We use this room for
physical therapy.

110
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,542
If they're sick and
want to take a nap,

111
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:43,167
they'll just come in
here and lay down.

112
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:46,250
You make sure you keep your
medications locked at all times.

113
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,750
And you lock the
door when you go out.

114
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,750
- Okay.

115
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,792
- You'll get used to it
it ain't no big deal.

116
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:52,625
- That's a lot.

117
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,917
Are those your
trophies over there?

118
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:57,083
- Yeah

119
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,500

you win them for.

120
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,083
- (mumbles)

121
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,458
- [Katie] You must be good.

122
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,708
- Oh yeah.

123
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,792
- [Katie] How many
trophies do you have?

124
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:06,667
- Two

125
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:09,167
Two two three

126
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,167
- [Katie] So you like fishing?

127
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:13,875
- Yeah

128
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,000
- [Katie] Where do you
usually go fishing at?

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,958
What kind of fish do
you like to catch?

130
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,875
- How do I help you?

131
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,708
- [Katie] What's on it?

132
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,000
- (mumbles)

133
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:55,958
- [Katie] Are you
making me a picture?

134
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,208
- Yeah. Your picture

135
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,125
- [Katie] Oh, it's pretty.

136
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,500
Do you want help coloring?

137
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,708
- No I can do it.

138
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,125
- You can do it yourself okay.

139
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,625
- I might mess it up.

140
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,667
- Can you put your name on it?

141
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,125
You wanna do that
in red or green?

142
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,000
Green?

143
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,583
Yeah.

144
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,708
You have a lot of
friends in here?

145
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,167
Yeah.

146
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:24,042
- (mumbles)

147
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:24,917
- Oh, I love it.

148
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:27,208
It's for me?

149
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,250
- Yeah

150
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,750
- Oh.

151
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,625
- Done

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,542
(laughing) I'm done

153
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:39,667
(coins chinking)

154
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:42,708
(low pitched sounds)

155
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,000
(door knocking)

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,125
- Hey . How was your first day?

157
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,542
- It, it felt really good.

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,292
- [Woman] Brandy said
that you did really well

159
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:09,792
with the clients back there?

160
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,042
- It was, it was a lot of fun.

161
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:14,167
- [Woman] So where
are you staying at?

162
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,750
I know you're new in the area.

163
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:19,708
- I actually got a
place in the country.

164
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,083
It needs a little work,

165
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,083
but I'm hoping to
stay there for awhile.

166
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,125
(loud drumming)

167
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,792
(coins chinking)

168
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:13,667
- [Man] Your family
didn't understand you.

169
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,875
They didn't deserve you.

170
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,042
(coins chinking)

171
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:20,167
You have a new family now

172
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,708
(coins chinking)

173
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:12,333
The devils

174
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,875
they listen to the
sounds of the innocent.

175
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,083
One

176
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,333
Two

177
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:24,292
Three

178
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:27,500
(loud drumming)

179
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,292
(coins chinking)

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,958
- [Man] This is Katie.

181
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,875
She's going to be
a guest for awhile

182
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,292
Come on

183
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,875
- [Katie] You're
ready for this dance.

184
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:05,708
Okay.

185
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,917
Alright. Let's go get in

186
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:14,375
Alright, come on and
get in over here.

187
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:19,750
Okay.

00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,083
Oh, good.

426
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,083
Hello.

427
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,292

430
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,500

431
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,542
(door clinking)

432
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:19,417
Hey,

433
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:24,167
- I didn't hear you come in.

434
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:26,875
- Sorry. I knocked, but
I didn't hear anybody.

435
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,333
- You need something?

436
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,292

437
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:34,250
(loud drumming)

438
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,083

439
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:04,458

440
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,958

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,125
There you go. Come on

443
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:13,917
(loud drumming)

444
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:24,167
So we use them all to
know when they're coming.

445
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,042
(mumbles) feel the beat.

446
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,375
(mumbles)

447
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:14,583
(fast drumming)

448
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:07,542
- [Brandy] Be careful

449
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,625
- Well, Hey, welcome back.

00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:12,000
- Hello

451
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,208
- You want to go in here?

452
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:15,417
You want to go in and sit down?

453
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:16,583
- I wanna sit down.

454
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,958
- You want to sit
down there okay.

455
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,625
Hey, how are you?

456
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:21,667
Do you have a good day?

457
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,083
Let's go to your chair.

458
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,958
Sound good?

459
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:25,667
- No.

460
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:27,000
- Okay.

461
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,958
Hey Steph,

462
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:32,417
- You all rested up?

463
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:38,375
- Oh yeah. Like I said, I
don't really sleep much so

464
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,125
I'm good.

465
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,792
How was Stephanie today?

466
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:49,208
She stayed by herself
most of the day.

467
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:50,125
Why?

468
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,625
- That was probably
nothing. I was just

469
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,458
it was probably nothing.

470
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:59,708
(playful music playing)

471
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:20,667
All right. Let's
get you in here.

472
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:25,292
Is that good stuff?
- yeah

473
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:26,167
- Okay.

474
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:28,833
Here you go.

475
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,333
That look good?

476
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,708
Here's your spoon.

477
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,750
(playful music playing)

478
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:56,208
(coins chinking)

479
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:08,875
(low pitched voices)

480
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:12,375
(woman screaming)

481
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,625
Steph are you okay?

482
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:15,500
It's okay

483
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:18,292
- Stephanie is sick.

484
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:21,042
- I'll get this out of your way.

485
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,750
(playful music playing)

486
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:46,292
(loud low-pitched sound)

487
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,458
(loud drumming)

488
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:54,292
(coins chinking)

489
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:03,542
(man laughing)

490
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:10,208
(woman laughing)

491
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:48,708
- [Girl] Where are you mommy?

492
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:57,417
(loud deafening sounds)

493
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,417
- [Man] Take a big breath
in and out one more time.

494
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:24,292
(Breaths heavily)

495
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:24,958
Okay, good.

496
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,917
Okay. Did you say she
got sick last night?

497
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:37,333
- Yeah, but I didn't notice
a fever or anything though.

498
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,000
- Okay.

499
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:40,750
I think she might
have just a little bit

500
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:44,708
of a respiratory infection and

501
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:47,000
we'll just watch it
for now and maybe get

502
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,458
some lab work and see
what that shows us okay.

503
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:51,542
- [Katie] Thank you

504
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:52,625
- You're doing
good. You're good.

505
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:53,500
Okay.

506
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:59,750
(coins chinking)

507
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:03,333
- Hey.

508
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:06,750
You can't have you
getting sick you hear me?

509
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:11,417
I'm not gonna let
them get you too.

510
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:12,292
- Yes

511
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:39,000
(loud drumming)

512
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:41,625
- The devils.

513
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:44,875
They listened to the
sounds of the innocent.

514
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,958
- What do you write in stories?

515
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:08,833
- No, I just write things
down so I don't forget them so

516
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,333
- I drank every night to
do the total opposite.

517
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Are you okay though?

518
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:19,750
- I just (chuckles) I
just worry a lot you know

519
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:22,875
- About Stephanie?

520
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,125
She hardly ever gets sick.

521
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,792
She just exaggerates
everything a lot.

522
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:29,667
- I hope so.

523
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:44,708
(coins chinking)

524
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:16,000
(loud drumming)

525
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:59,167
- [Man] You are so special

526
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:03,833
If you only knew.

527
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,208
(loud slapping)

528
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:20,958
- (Charles singing)

529
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:22,667
- [Katie] Hey Charles.

530
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:24,000
- Goodbye Ms Kimmy.

531
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,583
- Have you seen Stephanie?

532
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,750
You know where she's at?

533
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,958
- I don't know.

534
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:54,083
- [Brandy] Stephanie
you wait on me okay.

535
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:56,167
(mumbles)

536
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:08,083
(coins chinking)

537
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:11,000
(coughing)

538
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,167
- [Katie] Hey,

539
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:15,000
- Hey. Sorry it took us forever
to get here this morning.

540
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,625
- Is she okay?

541
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,250
- Yeah. She was like
stuck in the bed.

542
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,375
I don't know it's like
she was glued down.

543
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:22,750
(coughing)

544
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:26,583
(coins chinking)

545
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:45,042
(loud gong)

546
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:24,333
- [Man] The blood shows
the devils the way.

547
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:50,708
The devil they'll call
out for you if you listen.

548
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:52,833
Listen.

549
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:55,125
(loud gong)

550
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:48,167
One

551
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:54,958
Two

552
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:01,958
Three

553
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:09,750
Four

554
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,083
Five

555
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:22,333
Six

556
00:45:29,167 --> 00:45:30,042
Seven

557
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:53,083
- A sacrifice will
keep the devils away.

558
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:03,792
- Left hand side of this
are our dogs and our cats.

559
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,083
There are adoptions
we like to make sure

560
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:08,792
that they have a yard.

561
00:46:08,792 --> 00:46:09,750
Do you have a yard?

562
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:12,500
So we're needing
something small.

563
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,167
(dogs barking)

564
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:00,792
There are cats.

565
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:04,292
(cats chirrup)

566
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:23,333
- Who's this one?

567
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,083
- [Agent] That's
Mr. Will Pickle.

568
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:35,000
There you go

569
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,458
- All right.

570
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:37,375
Thanks.

571
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:39,000
- [Agent] Yes ma'am be careful.

572
00:47:52,542 --> 00:47:55,042
(cat meows)

573
00:48:27,042 --> 00:48:30,250
- Hey you just won't
be quiet will you?

574
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:54,667
I'll come back for
you a little bit okay.

575
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:07,167
Hey Steph did you do okay today?

576
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:10,750
- [Brandy] Yeah. She's still
up on and off all day long.

577
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,458
- She doing any better now or?

578
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:16,083
- No we had our doctor's
appointment rescheduled for

579
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:16,958
tomorrow.

580
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:21,292
Maybe they can do something
and she's just getting worse.

581
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,333
- All right. Well,
I'll take care of her.

582
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:25,208
- Okay.

583
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:27,750
- All right. Have a good one.

584
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:28,625
- You too.

585
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,375
(Suspenseful loud drumming)

586
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:36,208
(coins chinking)

587
00:49:58,167 --> 00:49:59,375
- Guys stay in here.

588
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:00,250
I'll be back.

589
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:49,083
- [Man] (mumbles)
they never come back.

590
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:52,208
Give it a place
with a lot of food.

591
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:53,083
It'll keep coming.

592
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,833
- Why so many?

593
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:56,792
- To protect us,

594
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,208
To protect us from them.

595
00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:03,208
I'll teach you soon enough.

596
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,167

you all better okay.

599
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,292
- Yeah.

600
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,417
- Poor thing.

601
00:51:28,417 --> 00:51:29,708
Let's grab our lunch boxes.

602
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:34,083
Take this one okay.

603
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,750
Did you get a cat?

604
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:50,833
- What?

605
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:51,708
- A cat.

606
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,583
- I used to have one.

607
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:12,250
- They're fixing to
come back and get her.

608
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:13,625
Do you want to go back with her?

609
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:14,625
- Yeah.

610
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:16,292
- If she's good with it.

611
00:52:16,292 --> 00:52:17,917
- Stephie You're going let
Ms.Katie go back with you?

612
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:18,833
- Yeah

613
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:19,708

614
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,708

617
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:13,542

618
00:53:13,542 --> 00:53:15,000

- Okay.

620
00:53:17,667 --> 00:53:19,250
Oh oh. It's going to be okay.

- It's okay. Relax.

622
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:31,583
- I'm just gonna tie this
around your arm okay.

623
00:53:35,917 --> 00:53:37,667
- [Katie] Hey Steph

624
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:38,708
- Now see your arm.

625
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:44,667

00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:23,917
With the alcohol.

- [Katie] It's okay.

635
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:44,500
It's okay. See that
wasn't so bad was it?

636
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:10,917
You need to rest up okay.

637
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:11,708
Come on.

638
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:18,458

(loud drumming)

641
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:28,625
But if the devils find them
their entrance must be blocked

642
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,875
by something that was
once part of the living.

643
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:32,833
- [Man] Once part of the living.

644
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:35,667
Find them

645
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:37,458
The devils find them.

646
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:43,458
Hello

00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:48,833
Hello. Hello.

All right.

649
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

650
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:06,042
Their entrance must be
blocked by something

651
00:57:06,042 --> 00:57:08,167
that was once part
of the living.

652
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:10,917
- [Man] Once part of the living.

653
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:55,458
(coins chinking)

654
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:20,542
- [Man] I can't wait
to show you the house.

655
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:23,958
You are loved now.

656
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:24,833
(door closing)

657
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:29,833
One

658
00:58:30,167 --> 00:58:30,833
Two

659
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:37,500
(car garage door opening)

660
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:03,042
- What the hell?

661
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:04,042
Stephany

662
00:59:04,042 --> 00:59:05,250
- Brandy wait.

663
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,125

664
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:13,042
- Brandy just let me explain

00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:16,833
Brandy.

00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:25,750
Brandy.

669
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:26,708
Brandy.

670
00:59:42,792 --> 00:59:46,042
- [Brandy] First off Katie is
writing this weird devil shit

671
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:47,625
in her notebook.

672
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,333
I came back to check on Steph,

673
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:52,583
Katie was asleep in the
house with this burnt up cat.

674
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,750
Crazy as shit we
can't have that.

675
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:00,042
The girl is just fucking crazy.

676
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:07,333
- Can you sign this please.

677
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:14,208
- Listen Stephanie is in trouble
I'm just trying to help her

678
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:15,917
- She's not your
concern anymore.

679
01:00:15,917 --> 01:00:18,625
It's on this so I don't have
to call the cops please.

680
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:00,083
- It's gonna be fine

681
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,083
it's too soon anyway

682
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:45,875
- They must be
taken to the house.

683
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:50,458
It's the only way to protect
them from the devils.

684
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:52,458
- [Man] From the devils.

685
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:56,167
They'll call out for
you if you listen

686
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:01,292
