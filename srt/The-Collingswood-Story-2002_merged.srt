1
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Ma...ma?

2
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,879
John?

3
00:01:51,254 --> 00:01:52,754
Wait! I-I can't see you!

4
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:54,129
Are you still there?

5
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:55,129
Yeah.

6
00:01:55,754 --> 00:01:56,754
Why is this thing...?

7
00:01:58,504 --> 00:01:59,504
What do I click?

8
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:01,504
Rebecca?

9
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,504
Yeah?

10
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:03,504
The video button.

11
00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:04,379
Duh.

12
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:07,879
Much better!

13
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,629
Hey!

14
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,254
Hey!

15
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,379
Took you long enough.

16
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:12,004
She's a little slow getting started, ok?

17
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:14,004
How are you?

18
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:15,379
Can't complain. Still kickin.

19
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:17,879
Can you really see me in this thing?

20
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:19,129
No.

21
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:23,879
Is this me or is it just... is it really confusing?

22
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:25,254
What?

23
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:27,004
Well, I look up here...

24
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:27,629
Yeah, at the cam.

25
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,129
But I want to look at the screen.

26
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,004
It takes a little getting used to.

27
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:34,004
Hey, not complaining, man. Really cool game.

28
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:43,629
Happy birthday to you!

29
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,129
Happy!

30
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:48,379
You know the rest.

31
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:49,754
Thanks, man.

32
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,504
What are you waiting for? Blow 'em out!

33
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:54,379
Huh?

34
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:56,504
Make a wish!

35
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:57,879
How?

36
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:01,129
Do it.

37
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:09,379
Dork.

38
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,504
This is great! This is so cool that we can see each other!

39
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:18,754
Wait, though. I don't know if I want everybody
seeing me every time I talk on this thing.

40
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:20,004
Why?

41
00:03:20,754 --> 00:03:22,254
You know! What if I have to...?

42
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:23,629
What?

43
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:28,754
That's the one thing about phone cams.

44
00:03:29,254 --> 00:03:30,629
What you see is what you get?

45
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,379
How's your birthday?

46
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,129
Spent most of it in class breathing in car fumes.

47
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,004
Ugh!

48
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:41,754
Yeah, Rutgers-Camden is located right
near the Ben Franklin Bridge so, uh...

49
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:45,004
I'm pretty much digging living off-campus right now.

50
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:46,504
You make a wish?

51
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:48,004
Mm-hmm.

52
00:03:48,004 --> 00:03:48,879
And what was it?

53
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:50,504
Uh uh.

54
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:51,129
Rebecca?

55
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:54,129
Ok. Have any of the ones you've ever told come true?

56
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:55,379
No.

57
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:56,754
Any of yours?

58
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:59,879
Well, the one about me getting
the hell out of Bedford sure did.

59
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,129
And! The one about me getting
accepted to a better school did!

60
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:03,879
Yes!

61
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:09,254
Getting out of Bedford was probably
the best thing I've done in my life.

62
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:10,254
Ouch.

63
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,004
Oh, hey, I didn't mean it like that.

64
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,379
Right.

65
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,879
I didn't, man, really.

66
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:19,754
I'm just giving you a hard time.

67
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:21,379
What else?

68
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,629
You seeing anyone?

69
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:26,004
Uuuuuh... no comment.

70
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:31,879
- This the place you're been telling me about?
- Yeah.

71
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,504
I'm... actually renting a room
in someone's house. It's, umm...

72
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:37,129
-...My first off campus pad.
- Sweet.

73
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:41,754
One thing about historic Collingswood,
we've got some pretty bitchin' old houses.

74
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:44,629
Here, let's see if I can move this thing.

75
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:50,504
- Look, see, it even has a closet!
- Knock yourself out!

76
00:04:51,254 --> 00:04:52,254
Lot's of space, huh?

77
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:53,379
Oh, yeah, yeah.

78
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:55,504
Oh, look what I picked up today.

79
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:59,629
What's that?

80
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:01,504
It's the house. Let's look through it.

81
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,004
- Can you see it?
- Yeah.

82
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:08,879
Am I holding it up ok?

83
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:13,129
Oh, yeah. It looks, uh... historic.

84
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:16,629
Not out on hardback yet?

85
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:17,504
Hm-mm

86
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:18,754
To the birthday girl!

87
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:20,629
In her new bitchin' pad.

88
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:21,629
Cheers!

89
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:28,504
Yeah, so, not bad for $300 a month.

90
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,254
So, the owners were having trouble renting
it out so, um, they lowered the price.

91
00:05:33,754 --> 00:05:36,754
He's a professor at school and I forget what she does.

92
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,629
Their bedroom above yours?

93
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,629
Um, no, actually I think it's the bathroom.

94
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:42,004
They quiet?

95
00:05:42,004 --> 00:05:43,504
No, no, they're not.

96
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:44,629
Wood floors, really.

97
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:46,504
You don't hear them cuz they're away.

98
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:48,379
What?

99
00:05:49,254 --> 00:05:50,004
Yeah, 'til Sunday.

100
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:52,004
Fuck! You shoulda had me down! Party weekend!

101
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:54,504
I know. I know, man.

102
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:57,379
We could be cruising into Philly right
now chowing down on cheesesteaks!

103
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:59,254
I have so much due on Monday.

104
00:05:59,254 --> 00:06:00,754
I waited 'til the last minute.

105
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:04,004
Right, uh, you didn't want
to see me. I can take a hint.

106
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:08,129
Look, next weekend when you come down, we'll party.

107
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:09,754
Glad to see you're doing ok, Beck.

108
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:16,879
Well...

109
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,504
Big plans for the night?

110
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:23,629
Naw, just gonna hang with Billy, you know?

111
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:26,379
Get in the fall spirit, carve pumpkins, get trashed.

112
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,879
Sounds fun.

113
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,129
How is Billy anyway?

114
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:31,004
He's Billy.

115
00:06:31,754 --> 00:06:34,754
Hey, were you fixin' to do something before I called?

116
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:37,879
Well, yeah, I was just gonna pop
my Swanson Delux in the microwave.

117
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:41,379
Can I give you a call back? You'll be around?

118
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:42,629
Call me when you're done.

119
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:43,754
Ok.

120
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:45,379
Hey.

121
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:49,504
Thanks for making my birthday so special.

122
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:50,879
It's not over yet.

123
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:53,629
It's not?

124
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:57,254
Bye!

125
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:59,379
See ya.

126
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:11,129
Billy

127
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:12,254
Yeah.

128
00:07:15,254 --> 00:07:17,129
Think I was gonna wait for everyone to get here?

129
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:26,879
Those things really work?

130
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,879
Oh, yes! Sure way to get shitfaced in half the time.

131
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:33,754
So, what's up? Talk to Rebecca?

132
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,129
Just did.

133
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:36,879
So, you missing her, man? Or what?

134
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:38,254
I don't know.

135
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:39,754
She's hard to read.

136
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,254
Why'd she leave Bedford?

137
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:46,129
She wanted to transfer to a better school.

138
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:48,629
No, no, no man. Why'd she really leave?

139
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:51,254
I just told you. She's tired of it.

140
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,129
She couldn't be around her step-dad.

141
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:58,504
Yeah, what happened to the, you know?

142
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:00,754
I don't know, man.

143
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,004
It's her birthday, ain't it?

144
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:04,754
Why aren't you there?

145
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:06,629
She's got too much to work on. She's stressin', man.

146
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:07,879
You know what that means.

147
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:11,379
- What?
- She's seeing some other loser.

148
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,629
Otherwise she woulda definitely wanted you there.

149
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:16,129
Dumb shit.

150
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:18,129
You really think so?

151
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:19,004
Yeah, uh huh.

152
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:20,129
Fuck you, Billy.

153
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:22,629
- You’re just trying to piss me off.
- I'm just telling you how it is.

154
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:23,629
Alright.

155
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,004
Why do you think you got her that video phone?

156
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:28,129
So you could stalk her online.

157
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,379
Don't waste your time, man.

158
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:35,129
When ya heading out?

159
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:37,129
I dunno. Think I'm gonna hang here tonight.

160
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:41,629
Been in any more phone cam sites?

161
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:44,004
You been to The Baroness?

162
00:08:45,254 --> 00:08:46,879
I told you about that one.

163
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:49,629
Here's one you probably haven't heard of.

164
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,004
I was, you know, checking through all these sites.

165
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:54,879
Ghost cams and spook houses, that sort of thing.

166
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,629
But, you know, they're all pretty lame.

167
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,879
Until I found Vera Madeline.

168
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,879
She's basically a psychic.

169
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,254
But her specialty is raising
the folks who push up the daisies.

170
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,504
Six feet under?

171
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,754
The dead?

172
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:09,629
No way.

173
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:11,504
$50 she gives a full on seance.

174
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:13,379
That's wild, man.

175
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:14,629
Yeah, and $50.

176
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:16,879
Just be warned.

177
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,879
Rip off.

178
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,754
Yeah.

179
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:23,004
She got in touch with my old man,
you know, who passed away in 1996.

180
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:25,629
He told her that he worries about me.

181
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:29,129
You know, wants me to get a life so he can be proud of me.

182
00:09:29,754 --> 00:09:30,629
Billy.

183
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:33,129
Since when did your dad die?

184
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:37,254
Yep, alright. Gimme her number.

185
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:39,879
This is it. Yeah.

186
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:41,629
555

187
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:43,379
8657

188
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:45,379
Check her out, man.

189
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:48,004
Hey, I gotta grab that. I'll call you back.

190
00:09:52,254 --> 00:09:53,379
What's up?

191
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:54,254
Hey!

192
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:56,004
Did you move your computer?

193
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,879
I installed the software on my laptop, so, now...

194
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:02,129
I can show you around easier.

195
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:07,004
Wow, you, uh, made your own portable phone cam gizmo.

196
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:09,879
Yeah, pretty crafty, huh?

197
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:12,629
And while you're at it, making
use of the phone line in the kitchen.

198
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:19,379
You know, now what I really need is one of those
super long phone cords and then this will really rock.

199
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:23,379
Ooh, check out what they've done in here. It's so great.

200
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:25,254
Look at that.

201
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:26,879
Isn't it cool?

202
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:29,754
Ah, I cannot wait to snoop in here some more.

203
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,754
Feeling better?

204
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:33,004
Yeah, now that I'm um...

205
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:35,629
...Pigging out.

206
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:43,379
Hey, um...

207
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:46,004
Beck, uh...

208
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:47,129
No biggie.

209
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:51,504
I was wondering if you were really by yourself there.

210
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:53,379
Huh?

211
00:10:56,004 --> 00:10:57,129
What's up?

212
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:02,629
Yeah, I hope the owners go away a lot.

213
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,254
It'll be too perfect.

214
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:05,504
You got it made, Beck.

215
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:10,129
Oh! That's my portable.

216
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,379
Check your email. I just sent you something.

217
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,504
Lemme grab that. Hold on.

218
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:18,879
Hello?

219
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:22,254
Hi, Mom.

220
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:26,254
Yeah, thanks for the sweater.

221
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,379
No, I love it. Yeah!

222
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:33,004
Got that whole, uh, New York thing going.

223
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,754
Yeah, Mom hang on a minute.

224
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:39,129
Hey, I'll call you back?

225
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:40,129
Oh, ok.

226
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:44,254
That was John.

227
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,504
He's ok.

228
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:50,004
No, no we're uh...

229
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:54,129
We're... we're gonna do something next weekend.

230
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:57,254
I dunno...just...

231
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,754
Just kind of feeling overwhelmed and...

232
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:01,754
Sort of felt like being alone.

233
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,379
Oh, you know, I don't think I'm
gonna be able to make it Thanksgiving.

234
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,379
Yeah, I mean, finals are coming up and I'm just...

235
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,004
Yeah.

236
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:22,754
Today? I had a great day!

237
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:25,379
No, it was-I had a lot of fun!

238
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,504
Yeah, how are things with you and Paul?

239
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:30,754
Oh?

240
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:32,504
He did.

241
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:36,754
Tell him I said hi.

242
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:39,879
Everything’s fine, Mom. Yeah, I love you.

243
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:41,504
Bye.

244
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:16,254
Hey, man!

245
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:19,004
She's alone.

246
00:13:20,504 --> 00:13:22,379
So, I was wrong. Made a mistake.

247
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:24,129
Big fucking deal.

248
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,004
Dumb shit.

249
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:27,504
Why you getting shitty with me?

250
00:13:27,504 --> 00:13:29,379
Fuck you, man. Last time I ever listen to you.

251
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:30,754
What's your fucking problem?

252
00:13:30,754 --> 00:13:32,129
You'll never let it go, will you?

253
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:33,629
That she dumped you.

254
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:34,629
Who?

255
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:35,879
Billy.

256
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:38,379
Oh, yeah?

257
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:42,129
Kiss this, ass munch. Come on,
right here. Come on, right here.

258
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:44,004
- Kiss that!
- No, thanks.

259
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:47,254
- I think I'm gonna hang here tonight.
- Oh, hold on, wait, wait. Hold on.

260
00:13:47,254 --> 00:13:49,879
You, uh, go to Vera Madeline?

261
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:50,879
Not yet.

262
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,254
Pshh, loser.

263
00:13:56,004 --> 00:13:57,754
Don't know what you're missing.

264
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,254
Have fun!

265
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:03,754
Dumb shit.

266
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:20,879
Yeah.

267
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:24,754
That's so cool how you got that thing hooked up!

268
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:27,504
Hmm.

269
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:30,004
I thought you were heading out?

270
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:33,254
Naw, Billy's having his entire
crowd over and I'm not in the mood.

271
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:37,004
So, I thought I'd take a chance and see if, uh...

272
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:38,254
You can distract me?

273
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:39,379
Yup!

274
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,254
Hey, you know what I've been thinking?

275
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:43,379
It's still my birthday. I want to have fun!

276
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:45,129
Now she's talking!

277
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:46,629
Speaking of which!

278
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:49,879
What are these numbers you emailed me?

279
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:53,379
Who are they?

280
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:55,379
No.

281
00:14:56,254 --> 00:14:58,629
You mean I can just...
I call these people in it?

282
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:02,379
- So she's ready to do a little phone searching.
- She is, she is!

283
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,004
What do I gotta do?

284
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:07,004
Nothing different. Keep the software
running and dial the number.

285
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:09,754
Theodore? Who's that?

286
00:15:09,754 --> 00:15:13,254
Something we've always joked about.
A little birthday entertainment.

287
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:14,379
Noooo.

288
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:17,254
No, you didn't! It's not a stripper, is it?

289
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:20,879
Have fun.

290
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,129
Ok, Bye.

291
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:41,379
There's no one there...

292
00:15:43,004 --> 00:15:44,004
Hello?

293
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:46,379
God dog!

294
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:49,504
I'm sorry. I think I called the wrong number.

295
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:55,379
- Um... Who am I calling?
- You look about...

296
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:58,504
...Beautiful 21.

297
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:02,379
I've done some of that.

298
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:07,379
What's your name?

299
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,254
Um... I...

300
00:16:13,254 --> 00:16:15,504
A friend of mine gave me your number.

301
00:16:15,504 --> 00:16:20,004
I'm a dancer, baby.
Hoo coo coo ca ca, baby.

302
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:25,129
Ole, ole, ole, Bah! Boo! Bah! Yeah!

303
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:30,254
You know, I... Look. Have a great night, man.
I, um, I gotta go.

304
00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:32,129
Why come in so short?

305
00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:35,504
I-I don't really know what to say.

306
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,129
Uh, what, I mean...

307
00:16:48,004 --> 00:16:51,629
You just, you just leave this cam on
and people just call you?

308
00:16:52,754 --> 00:16:54,254
24/7!

309
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:56,629
What do you talk about?

310
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:57,879
Open up to me.

311
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,004
We all got a little bit of...

312
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:04,129
...Wicked in us!

313
00:17:05,129 --> 00:17:06,254
Open up!

314
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:26,879
Who the hell was that?

315
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:30,254
Just your average cam nut.

316
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:35,254
-Ugh, thanks a lot!
-Beck, first time I called him I was so stoned!

317
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:39,254
He just wanted to chill and talk weird
shit about mushroom radiation.

318
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:41,504
Where did you find him?

319
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:44,129
Yellow Pages.
He's listed in the phone cam directory.

320
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:46,504
I cannot believe people.

321
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:51,254
I mean, they have these cams in their homes and they just...
They leave them on what? 24/7?

322
00:17:51,254 --> 00:17:53,004
Just harmless exhibitionists.

323
00:17:53,004 --> 00:17:54,129
Right.

324
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:57,754
What was that?

325
00:17:58,629 --> 00:17:59,879
You're getting another call.

326
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,254
On this?

327
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:02,254
Yup.

328
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:03,379
I'm scared.

329
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:05,379
Trust me.

330
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:07,254
This is the best birthday entertainment.

331
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,629
You're gonna remember this night.

332
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:11,129
Ok, hold on.

333
00:18:17,254 --> 00:18:18,254
Hi, Rebecca!

334
00:18:18,254 --> 00:18:19,004
Hello?

335
00:18:19,004 --> 00:18:20,129
Happy birthday.

336
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:21,879
This song is for you!

337
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:48,004
Great!

338
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:53,629
What did you think?

339
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:54,504
Cute?

340
00:18:55,504 --> 00:18:58,129
And he got my number how?

341
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:00,379
I gave it to him.

342
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:02,504
Great.

343
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:05,379
You get it? He's a singing telegram.

344
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:06,379
Oh!

345
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:09,629
Wow, this is a trip, John. I love it.

346
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:11,629
Having fun?

347
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:14,129
Yeah, yeah. I think.

348
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:16,504
Ok. One more. She's a cam psychic.

349
00:19:16,504 --> 00:19:21,629
- Oh!
- She's got a gift according to Billy
for contacting the dearly departed.

350
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:25,379
- I thought I'd go first...
- No, no, no! I want to!

351
00:19:26,004 --> 00:19:26,754
Ok.

352
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:29,629
Yeah, these 1 -800 people crack me up.

353
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:31,504
Is this it?

354
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:37,129
Maybe she can tell me if its in the stars
if I'll pass or fail this semester.

355
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:39,504
Good luck.

356
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:40,379
I'll call you back.

357
00:19:56,879 --> 00:20:01,504
"Welcome to my paranormal realm where
psychic secrets and desires are revealed."

358
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:03,879
"My name is Vera Madeline."

359
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:05,754
"I am a clairvoyant medium."

360
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:08,629
"I offer spiritual guidance and knowledge."

361
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:11,504
"I am a very positive, honest person."

362
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,879
"I never knowingly will cause you anxiety."

363
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:18,754
"If you are open and if you believe anything is possible."

364
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:22,379
"Do you certify that you are at least
18 years of age or older?"

365
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:26,129
Oh, um, yes.

366
00:20:27,254 --> 00:20:32,004
"Then if you are comfortable and understand that this
is for entertainment purposes only, we may begin."

367
00:20:32,504 --> 00:20:33,754
"What's your name, hun?"

368
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:37,129
Lisa.

369
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:40,379
"Your initial reading is 100% free."

370
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:41,254
Lisa.

371
00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:44,379
"After that I charge only $19.95 for ten minutes."

372
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:47,254
"A seance experience is $50."

373
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:52,129
"For years I have successfully and
comfortably helped others contact DPs."

374
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:54,504
I'm sorry, DPs?

375
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:57,754
Dead people.

376
00:20:58,129 --> 00:20:58,879
Oh.

377
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:00,504
How old are you?

378
00:21:00,504 --> 00:21:01,254
21.

379
00:21:01,254 --> 00:21:03,629
And the psychic state you're calling from?

380
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:05,129
New Jersey.

381
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:07,629
Place your right hand on the cam.

382
00:21:17,254 --> 00:21:18,004
Mm hm.

383
00:21:21,504 --> 00:21:22,379
Thank you.

384
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:28,754
You're a very deep and sensitive young lady.

385
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:33,504
However you're stubborn.

386
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:37,254
You don't have a lot of patience for people, do you?

387
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:48,629
Something happened to you recently. Something disturbing.

388
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,504
Did it have to do with a family member?

389
00:22:05,379 --> 00:22:06,254
Woah.

390
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:08,254
That's weird.

391
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:16,254
Somebody's trying to make contact.

392
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:18,879
What?

393
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:24,754
There's something he wishes Rebecca to know?

394
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:27,254
I can't hear you.

395
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:48,504
You're very receptive.

396
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:51,254
How'd you know my name?

397
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:52,629
There's much more to tell.

398
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:55,254
I accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover.

399
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:56,379
Nah, pretty cool, though.

400
00:22:56,379 --> 00:23:00,129
Please feel free to visit me on
my website veramadeline.com.

401
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,629
God bless.

402
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:16,629
Oh my god!

403
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,754
You have to go to this freak.

404
00:23:18,754 --> 00:23:21,754
I can't even explain to you. I don't
know how to describe it. Just go.

405
00:23:21,754 --> 00:23:22,629
Really?

406
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:27,004
She's got the candles burning in
the background and this hokey music.

407
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:28,004
You have to go.

408
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:30,004
But did she read you?

409
00:23:30,004 --> 00:23:33,879
Pretty lame. She said I was,
um, stubborn and intelligent.

410
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,254
Huh.

411
00:23:35,254 --> 00:23:37,629
Please, they just say stuff that applies to anyone.

412
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:39,004
Although, this was weird.

413
00:23:39,504 --> 00:23:42,504
I didn't want to tell her my name because,
you know, so...

414
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:46,254
...I just told her it was Lisa. But
then later she called me Rebecca.

415
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:49,129
Unless...

416
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,129
What?

417
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:55,879
People can use their caller IDs with this, huh?

418
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:59,129
What a joke!

419
00:24:00,504 --> 00:24:02,004
So what's her place like?

420
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:04,129
Trust me. You'll see.

421
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:06,254
She's got that whole cliche going. Don't worry.

422
00:24:06,254 --> 00:24:08,629
She make, uh, contact with anybody?

423
00:24:09,254 --> 00:24:13,129
Yeah, some DP said something
in another language. Kinda lost me.

424
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:15,379
Dead person.

425
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:19,504
I don't know how she keeps a straight face.

426
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:22,129
Sounds like she takes herself a little too seriously.

427
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:23,879
So you didn't do the whole seance thing?

428
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,379
Yeah right. Like I've got
an extra $50 laying around.

429
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:29,629
Pretty steep. Pretty sure she's
got the car payment to make.

430
00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:31,129
Ok. My turn.

431
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:32,879
Kay. Good luck. Call me back.

432
00:24:37,004 --> 00:24:41,254
"Welcome to my paranormal realm. Where psychic
secrets and desires are revealed."

433
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:45,754
"My name is Vera Madeline. I am a clairvoyant medium."

434
00:24:46,379 --> 00:24:48,629
"I offer spiritual guidance and knowledge."

435
00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:51,879
"I am a very positive, honest person."

436
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:54,504
"I never knowingly will cause you anxiety."

437
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:58,754
- Better not.
- "If you are open and believe anything is possible."
- Just kidding.

438
00:24:59,504 --> 00:25:02,504
"Do you certify that you are at least
18 years of age or older?"

439
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:08,129
"Then if you are comfortable and understand that this is for
entertainment purposes only, we may begin."

440
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:10,129
"What's your name, hun?"

441
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:11,629
John.

442
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:14,879
"Your initial reading is 100% free."

443
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:15,504
John.

444
00:25:15,504 --> 00:25:18,504
"After that I charge only $19.95 for ten minutes."

445
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:21,254
"A seance experience is $50."

446
00:25:21,254 --> 00:25:25,379
"For years I have successfully and comfortably helped others
contact dead people."
-Dead people.

447
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:30,379
Have I helped you before?

448
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:32,504
Couple buddies of mine have been to you recently.

449
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:34,379
Oh, a referral.

450
00:25:35,504 --> 00:25:36,504
How old are you?

451
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:37,129
26.

452
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:40,004
And the psychic state you're calling from?

453
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:42,504
Virginia.

454
00:25:43,004 --> 00:25:44,754
Place your right hand on the cam.

455
00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:54,379
Hmm.

456
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:56,879
Thank you.

457
00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:02,504
You're a very deep and sincere young man.

458
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:04,379
Passionate.

459
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:05,629
Strong.

460
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:11,754
However, you're indecisive and gullible.

461
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:18,754
There's a change going on in the workplace right
now, and you're not quite sure what to do next.

462
00:26:18,754 --> 00:26:20,129
No, I love what I do.

463
00:26:20,504 --> 00:26:22,004
I'm getting a hospital.

464
00:26:23,504 --> 00:26:26,754
There's someone in your life who you desire and yet...

465
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:29,379
...You're not sure if the feeling is mutual.

466
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:37,754
- Wait, is this because that this individual...
-...This individual move out of your psychic state?

467
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:41,879
How did you know that?

468
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:45,879
This individual, they just called you.

469
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:47,379
I get hundreds of calls.

470
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:49,004
This was a couple of minutes ago.

471
00:26:51,754 --> 00:26:52,879
This, uh...

472
00:26:54,754 --> 00:26:55,754
This referral.

473
00:26:56,129 --> 00:26:57,129
What was the name?

474
00:26:57,129 --> 00:26:58,254
Rebecca.

475
00:27:01,254 --> 00:27:02,129
From Jersey.

476
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,754
Where in Jersey does she live?

477
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:09,004
I don't think I want to give that information out over this.

478
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,754
No, not the address, the city.

479
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:11,754
Quickly.

480
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:12,129
Why?

481
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:12,879
Quickly!

482
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:16,129
Collingswood.

483
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:21,504
Fear is very well known to mediums and psychics.

484
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:24,504
There is darkness.

485
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:27,254
The town has not recovered from it.

486
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:31,879
Hey. You're starting to lose me here, I don't...

487
00:27:43,254 --> 00:27:47,879
Umm... was there supposed to be
a translation or subtitles with that?

488
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:53,629
Too many people are blinded by the truth.

489
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:56,379
They suffer. They die.

490
00:27:57,629 --> 00:27:59,129
I have a message for your friend.

491
00:27:59,129 --> 00:27:59,754
What?

492
00:27:59,754 --> 00:28:00,879
She must call me.

493
00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:04,629
I am compelled by forces you know nothing of.

494
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:07,629
Beck's kind of a starving student.
I don't know if she would, uh...

495
00:28:08,379 --> 00:28:09,754
I will not charge her.

496
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:13,879
She really doesn't believe in this stuff.

497
00:28:15,004 --> 00:28:17,129
- Why don't you tell me, and then I'll tell her.
- No.

498
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:20,754
- Then you open yourself up to...
- I think I can handle it. I'm pretty solid.

499
00:28:20,754 --> 00:28:21,879
No. You can't.

500
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,379
No. I can.

501
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:28,254
Look, why don't you just tell me, alright? I wanna know.

502
00:28:28,254 --> 00:28:30,754
Please. I'll pay you.

503
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:33,004
Tell her what I know.

504
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:38,129
What?

505
00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:39,629
There are rumors...

506
00:28:41,004 --> 00:28:43,254
...Of a secret society.

507
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:46,254
An underground cult.

508
00:28:46,254 --> 00:28:49,379
It's founding member was Alan Tashi.

509
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:52,129
He lived in Collingswood.

510
00:28:53,004 --> 00:28:55,504
In the mid-1800s, I'm not sure when.

511
00:28:55,504 --> 00:29:00,754
The neighbors discovered
the bodies of 9 girls in a well.

512
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:03,129
On his property.

513
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:11,629
Their eyes had been carved out and their
mouths had been cut from ear to ear.

514
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:14,004
Giving them a grotesque smile.

515
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:20,879
When the townspeople found out about it they surrounded
his house, but he had barricaded himself inside.

516
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:25,254
They knocked the doors down and they searched all
the rooms, but they couldn't find him anywhere.

517
00:29:27,254 --> 00:29:31,129
They did find one thing, though. Up in the attic.

518
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:34,754
If I remember correctly it was a child's toy.

519
00:29:35,254 --> 00:29:36,629
A stick of wood.

520
00:29:38,754 --> 00:29:40,379
With a tin face on it.

521
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:43,629
A Halloween shaker.

522
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:48,379
Left by Alan Tashi.

523
00:29:51,754 --> 00:29:54,504
This really happened in Collingswood, NJ?

524
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:59,504
Is the house still there? I mean,
do you know where it's at?

525
00:29:59,504 --> 00:30:00,879
Lee's Lane.

526
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:04,379
The house is on Lee's Lane.

527
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:10,004
What does this got to do with my friend?

528
00:30:10,004 --> 00:30:15,004
Maybe nothing. I offer guidance
and I am compelled to tell you.

529
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:16,879
It still exists.

530
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:20,379
This all kind of sounds out there.

531
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:22,254
The truth usually is.

532
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,254
I could go on, but...

533
00:30:24,754 --> 00:30:25,879
But what?

534
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:26,879
Just tell her.

535
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,629
Hey. What did you think of Madame Vera?

536
00:30:53,379 --> 00:30:55,129
What? Didn't have a good reading?

537
00:30:55,129 --> 00:30:57,629
She's hokey like you said.

538
00:30:59,504 --> 00:31:01,379
But, then it kinda got...

539
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:05,129
She went on about this stuff
that happened in Collingswood.

540
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:05,754
What?

541
00:31:05,754 --> 00:31:07,504
She wanted you to call her.

542
00:31:07,504 --> 00:31:08,504
Why?

543
00:31:08,504 --> 00:31:10,879
She said you were receptive.

544
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:13,504
She probably says that about everyone.

545
00:31:14,004 --> 00:31:15,504
You didn't give her this number, did you?

546
00:31:15,504 --> 00:31:16,254
No.

547
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:20,004
Good, because I don't want anyone
else we call on this to have it.

548
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,629
She just wants me to call her
so that I can pay her to do that.

549
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:24,629
She said she wouldn't charge you.

550
00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:29,254
It's a come on. It has to be. I mean...

551
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:33,379
She says she won't charge and then
you call and then she starts a story.

552
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:36,379
And then you get hooked and
then she won't finish until you pay.

553
00:31:39,754 --> 00:31:41,004
Ok, what?

554
00:31:41,504 --> 00:31:43,004
Tell me. I know you want to.

555
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:48,004
Beck, weird shit, about a secret society.

556
00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:49,379
What?

557
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:51,629
She said it was an underground thing.

558
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:56,129
There's this house in Collingswood
where all these bodies were found.

559
00:31:58,754 --> 00:32:01,004
She knew the name of the street and everything.

560
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,129
Which was?

561
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,004
I wrote it down.

562
00:32:05,504 --> 00:32:08,254
Lee's Lane. Is there a Lee's Lane?

563
00:32:08,254 --> 00:32:11,254
K, are you trying to freak me
out? Cuz it's not gonna work.

564
00:32:11,254 --> 00:32:12,254
Is there?

565
00:32:13,254 --> 00:32:14,129
Mm hmm.

566
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:15,754
How does she know that?

567
00:32:16,254 --> 00:32:20,004
Like she just didn't happen to have a map of
Collingswood there and pulled Lee's Lane off of it.

568
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:24,004
Or she's trying to freak you out
because Halloween's in what, two days?

569
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:26,504
You know it takes a lot for me to get freaked.

570
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:30,129
The bodies were stuffed inside a well.

571
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:33,004
Where's Lee's Lane?

572
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:36,504
I don't know. I might have passed
it on the way to school today.

573
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:38,129
I have to find out for sure.

574
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:40,004
Maybe you should.

575
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:42,504
Why?

576
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:48,254
So I can take a picture in front of the well
and send it back to all my friends in Bedford?

577
00:32:48,629 --> 00:32:50,629
Its a little late to be sending out Halloween cards.

578
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:54,629
So do they know who killed them?

579
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:55,879
All those girls?

580
00:32:56,629 --> 00:32:58,254
Of course it was girls.

581
00:32:59,504 --> 00:33:03,504
The guy that lived in the house.
Um, Alan something.

582
00:33:03,504 --> 00:33:04,754
What happened to the guy?

583
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:07,254
They never found him.

584
00:33:07,254 --> 00:33:09,504
Of course. He just disappeared.

585
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:13,879
What they did find, according to
the psychic, was this old toy.

586
00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:17,254
A Halloween shaker or something like that.

587
00:33:18,504 --> 00:33:23,004
Look, maybe this is something she says to
anybody who calls from any town. You know?

588
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,379
Yeah.

589
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:34,504
Ok, look, maybe I'll look up the darker side of
Collingswood. See if there's anything on the web.

590
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:38,879
The owners did mention something about
an official Collingswood website.

591
00:33:43,629 --> 00:33:46,004
Listen, I'm really gonna try and get some work done.

592
00:33:47,129 --> 00:33:51,254
Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry. I don't
mean to be a bad influence.

593
00:33:51,254 --> 00:33:55,504
No, it's just, I have so much to
get through before tomorrow and...

594
00:33:55,504 --> 00:33:57,754
Still want to get out before it gets
too late and pick up some smokes.

595
00:33:57,754 --> 00:34:00,754
- It's just gonna be a huge day tomorrow.
- Yeah, me too.

596
00:34:01,504 --> 00:34:02,129
You working?

597
00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:02,879
Til 6.

598
00:34:04,504 --> 00:34:07,254
Ok, well I better...

599
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,879
Don't stay up too late.

600
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:12,129
Talk to you later. Thanks again.

601
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:13,379
Good night.

602
00:34:14,254 --> 00:34:15,129
Good night.

603
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:57,004
Blah, blah, blah...

604
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:29,004
Wow.

605
00:35:49,129 --> 00:35:50,129
Oh my god.

606
00:36:20,254 --> 00:36:21,004
Hey.

607
00:36:22,004 --> 00:36:23,379
Too tired to go back out?

608
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:25,254
- Beck.
- What's up?

609
00:36:26,129 --> 00:36:29,629
There's something I want to tell you about,
but I don't want to freak you out.

610
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:32,004
I think you should hear this.

611
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:36,629
John, I really don't care
what else the psychic said.

612
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:38,754
It has nothing to do with her.

613
00:36:38,754 --> 00:36:40,879
It has to do with the
house you moved into.

614
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,004
I don't think they told you.

615
00:36:46,629 --> 00:36:47,254
They?

616
00:36:47,254 --> 00:36:48,629
The owners.

617
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:53,129
A family that lived there. They were murdered.

618
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:58,254
Ok, you're trying to freak me out?
Cuz the psychic didn't, right?

619
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:00,379
It's not gonna work.

620
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:02,004
Beck, I'm not.

621
00:37:04,629 --> 00:37:05,379
Yeah?

622
00:37:06,754 --> 00:37:07,879
What's up with you?

623
00:37:08,754 --> 00:37:11,379
I looked it up on the web right after we hung up.

624
00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:14,754
There was articles in the Collingswood
Post. They had a picture of the house.

625
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:15,879
I don't believe you.

626
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:20,254
This judge that lived there...

627
00:37:21,254 --> 00:37:23,879
...He killed his wife and his
two kids before killing himself.

628
00:37:25,129 --> 00:37:27,129
It was really fucking sick.

629
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:30,129
He knocked them out and
dragged them to the bathtub.

630
00:37:30,129 --> 00:37:31,754
They were still alive.

631
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:37,379
They died from being held
under water in the bathtub.

632
00:37:38,254 --> 00:37:39,254
Are you serious?

633
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,379
Don’t joke about kids dying, ok?

634
00:37:49,629 --> 00:37:51,004
Wonder why they didn't tell me?

635
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:52,629
Because they wanted to rent it out.

636
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:55,879
Beck, it's almost exactly what
the psychic was telling me.

637
00:37:56,379 --> 00:37:58,754
The judge, he was in this cult.

638
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:01,754
Beck, she was right.

639
00:38:02,504 --> 00:38:04,129
It's still going on.

640
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:06,129
People need to get a life.

641
00:38:12,379 --> 00:38:15,379
I'm sorry. I just thought you should know.

642
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,754
I'll tell ya, what a birthday.

643
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:22,879
Different, huh.

644
00:38:23,379 --> 00:38:24,379
I'll say.

645
00:38:30,379 --> 00:38:34,504
Well, I was kind of jazzed about
being here all by myself, but, um, now...

646
00:38:37,254 --> 00:38:38,754
You know what we can do?

647
00:38:39,254 --> 00:38:40,129
What?

648
00:38:42,379 --> 00:38:45,379
We don't have to turn this off.
I mean, we don't have to hang up.

649
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:47,629
Leave it on all night?

650
00:38:49,254 --> 00:38:53,379
God, we're gonna be like
the freaks that leave it on 24/7.

651
00:38:54,629 --> 00:38:56,379
Won't that be kind of expensive?

652
00:38:56,379 --> 00:38:57,504
It's on me.

653
00:38:57,504 --> 00:38:59,129
This way we can, uh...

654
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:00,629
Sleep together?

655
00:39:02,504 --> 00:39:04,254
Safest sex we'll ever have.

656
00:39:06,504 --> 00:39:07,129
Kay.

657
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,629
It'll be kind of nice actually.

658
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:23,254
What time you getting up?

659
00:39:23,754 --> 00:39:25,379
I'd like to get up before 8:00.

660
00:39:26,254 --> 00:39:27,379
I'll wake you up.

661
00:39:28,004 --> 00:39:29,754
I'm usually up around 7:00 these days.

662
00:39:33,629 --> 00:39:34,504
Cool.

663
00:39:55,629 --> 00:39:56,379
John?

664
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:58,254
Don't think about it.

665
00:39:59,504 --> 00:40:00,754
Just get some sleep.

666
00:40:10,129 --> 00:40:13,629
They found the bodies
in the bathroom upstairs?

667
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:15,879
Just get some sleep.

668
00:41:32,254 --> 00:41:34,254
Be afraid of his love.

669
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

670
00:42:44,504 --> 00:42:46,254
I was dreaming.

671
00:43:00,129 --> 00:43:01,754
Rebecca.

672
00:43:04,004 --> 00:43:04,754
Wake up.

673
00:43:17,254 --> 00:43:18,754
Long time, no see.

674
00:43:23,629 --> 00:43:24,754
What time is it?

675
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:27,004
10:30

676
00:43:28,754 --> 00:43:29,504
Shit!

677
00:43:31,504 --> 00:43:33,504
The library closes early today, John.

678
00:43:35,004 --> 00:43:36,629
Thought you were gonna get me up at 8:00!

679
00:43:36,629 --> 00:43:37,754
I overslept.

680
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,004
I gotta book.

681
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,504
I'm sorry about last night.

682
00:43:46,879 --> 00:43:48,004
When will you be back?

683
00:43:48,004 --> 00:43:48,629
I dunno.

684
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:52,754
Good one.

685
00:44:00,379 --> 00:44:01,129
Hello?

686
00:44:03,754 --> 00:44:05,004
Have fun last night?

687
00:44:05,004 --> 00:44:06,629
Yeah, did you?

688
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:09,379
You get any?

689
00:44:13,504 --> 00:44:14,504
What time is it?

690
00:44:15,129 --> 00:44:16,379
Little after 11:00.

691
00:44:17,004 --> 00:44:18,629
Oh, man! Why don't you let me sleep?

692
00:44:18,629 --> 00:44:19,379
Hang on.

693
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:23,254
Billy.

694
00:44:24,004 --> 00:44:26,129
I need you to be straight
with me about something.

695
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:29,754
That psychic you told me about. Do
you know her? I mean, where's she from?

696
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:34,504
I don't think that lady gives refunds
just cuz that's what you're hoping for.

697
00:44:34,504 --> 00:44:36,754
She knew about all this stuff
that happened in Collingswood.

698
00:44:36,754 --> 00:44:38,129
Where Rebecca is?

699
00:44:38,129 --> 00:44:38,879
Yeah.

700
00:44:39,879 --> 00:44:40,629
What things?

701
00:44:40,629 --> 00:44:42,379
I know this sounds kind of...

702
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:45,379
She told me about this cult and its leader.

703
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:49,504
He was into human sacrifices.

704
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:53,254
She wanted Beck and I to
know that this cult still exists.

705
00:44:53,254 --> 00:44:55,254
Sure got your $50 worth.

706
00:44:55,254 --> 00:44:57,004
She never took our money.

707
00:44:58,254 --> 00:44:59,879
Did you tell her to fuck with us?

708
00:45:00,254 --> 00:45:00,754
Huh?

709
00:45:01,754 --> 00:45:02,754
Did you?

710
00:45:03,879 --> 00:45:05,879
Sounds like you're believing all this crap.

711
00:45:06,379 --> 00:45:09,004
I know it sounds like a scam.
I mean, come on, man.

712
00:45:09,004 --> 00:45:12,754
Until I decided to see if there was anything
backing up what the lady was saying.

713
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:16,504
Fuck!
I've been sleeping in pumpkin shit all night.

714
00:45:16,504 --> 00:45:17,504
Listen.

715
00:45:17,879 --> 00:45:19,379
The house Beck's renting a room in...

716
00:45:19,879 --> 00:45:22,879
Four years ago this judge living there, he snapped.

717
00:45:22,879 --> 00:45:25,254
He took out his whole family and then himself.

718
00:45:26,254 --> 00:45:28,254
He was a member of that cult.

719
00:45:29,504 --> 00:45:32,504
Maybe Vera delivers the goods after all.

720
00:45:33,754 --> 00:45:35,504
Does your little Beck know?

721
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:38,879
Rebecca. I call her Beck.

722
00:45:39,254 --> 00:45:42,254
K, does Rebecca know about the murder/suicide?

723
00:45:42,629 --> 00:45:45,629
Yeah. I guess I should've waited, I mean...

724
00:45:46,129 --> 00:45:47,379
She's all alone this weekend.

725
00:45:47,379 --> 00:45:51,254
Rebecca's all alone in
that house and you told her?

726
00:45:52,629 --> 00:45:54,879
Wait, wait, wait. I get it.

727
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:59,879
You thought that scaring the shit out of
Rebecca would, what, bring her back to Bedford?

728
00:46:02,254 --> 00:46:03,629
There's meds for that.

729
00:46:04,379 --> 00:46:05,254
Get some.

730
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,629
Wait.

731
00:46:43,629 --> 00:46:44,379
What?

732
00:47:02,504 --> 00:47:06,629
Ok, John, I'm gonna attempt to drive
and hold the cam without crashing.

733
00:47:07,504 --> 00:47:09,379
Here you go! Your first video email.

734
00:47:09,754 --> 00:47:12,254
Coming to you from the one
and only Collingswood cam.

735
00:47:12,754 --> 00:47:13,754
Big whoop.

736
00:47:18,504 --> 00:47:21,129
Ok, I'm just taking a short cut through Crow's Park.

737
00:47:21,504 --> 00:47:22,879
They say it's famous.

738
00:47:23,504 --> 00:47:25,504
Who knows for what, maybe the crows?

739
00:47:25,504 --> 00:47:28,004
Hey, I don't want to run any of the locals over.

740
00:47:28,004 --> 00:47:30,004
Smile! Fools.

741
00:47:33,254 --> 00:47:35,129
Ooh, how bout that spirit, huh?

742
00:47:35,879 --> 00:47:37,629
Do they get into it or what?

743
00:47:40,504 --> 00:47:43,504
Smile! You're on Collingswood Cam!

744
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,004
Ok, I'm on Admiral Wilson Boulevard.

745
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:50,504
Rutgers-Camden! Don't miss the exit.

746
00:47:53,379 --> 00:47:55,504
Ok, I'm gonna head to the library.

747
00:47:55,879 --> 00:47:58,879
Hope these are all coming out. I'll see ya! Bye.

748
00:48:11,379 --> 00:48:13,754
This is the place where Becca lives?

749
00:48:14,754 --> 00:48:16,629
The crime scene photo. What's that thing?

750
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:19,129
What is it?

751
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:22,254
I think it's this thing the psychic described to me.

752
00:48:22,754 --> 00:48:25,004
Its something left behind by the cult leader.

753
00:48:27,379 --> 00:48:28,504
Man, there's nothing.

754
00:48:31,004 --> 00:48:33,129
Maybe you should give that psychic a call back.

755
00:48:33,879 --> 00:48:36,879
See if she can help you track it down for you again.

756
00:48:38,379 --> 00:48:41,379
Man, get out. Get some fresh air. You need it.

757
00:48:47,129 --> 00:48:48,254
Have fun at work.

758
00:48:56,754 --> 00:48:59,754
Hey. It's me again.

759
00:49:00,379 --> 00:49:01,754
I'm done for the day.

760
00:49:04,254 --> 00:49:08,754
I read the same newspaper articles you did.

761
00:49:10,254 --> 00:49:14,879
The judge that lived in my house,
they think he was a member of that cult.

762
00:49:17,004 --> 00:49:18,754
K, how does that look?

763
00:49:19,254 --> 00:49:22,254
It's the, um, park cam.

764
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,129
I could sit here for...

765
00:49:28,629 --> 00:49:31,004
Ok, I know, I have no life.

766
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:35,379
I read conflicting things on that cult, though.

767
00:49:35,379 --> 00:49:40,254
One said that it originated in France
in a province outside of Lyons.

768
00:49:41,504 --> 00:49:44,504
And that's where the guy, the cult leader, was from.

769
00:49:44,504 --> 00:49:45,754
What's his name?

770
00:49:46,754 --> 00:49:48,254
The one that lived on Lee's Lane?

771
00:49:49,379 --> 00:49:51,379
Which I still haven't been able to find.

772
00:49:52,754 --> 00:49:55,379
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

773
00:50:23,004 --> 00:50:24,004
You're back.

774
00:50:25,254 --> 00:50:26,879
Long day. How's work?

775
00:50:30,504 --> 00:50:32,504
Oh, their library.

776
00:50:33,504 --> 00:50:35,254
I know. I'm basically all over the place.

777
00:50:35,254 --> 00:50:37,754
Watch, they come home early and
find I've taken over their house.

778
00:50:37,754 --> 00:50:38,879
Oh, look.

779
00:50:40,629 --> 00:50:42,004
Hundred feet of phone cord.

780
00:50:42,629 --> 00:50:46,254
Now, while you watch it live,
I can wander all through the house.

781
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:49,879
Did you get the emails?

782
00:50:50,254 --> 00:50:53,254
You got a little carried away.
They take forever to download.

783
00:50:56,379 --> 00:50:58,629
So, the cult started in France.

784
00:50:58,629 --> 00:50:59,629
Yeah.

785
00:51:00,879 --> 00:51:03,629
But, who's to say what's
credible and what's not.

786
00:51:03,629 --> 00:51:07,254
I mean, I read something else and
it said that the cult was a myth.

787
00:51:07,254 --> 00:51:09,254
- No way.
- There never even was one, so...

788
00:51:09,254 --> 00:51:11,754
Beck, I don't see how that could be. I mean...

789
00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:14,754
...There's all the articles and all the proof.

790
00:51:15,254 --> 00:51:17,129
Except for that judge that lived here.

791
00:51:17,629 --> 00:51:20,254
No miss there. Sicko.

792
00:51:21,379 --> 00:51:23,129
How could you do that to your own kids?

793
00:51:24,629 --> 00:51:26,504
It's fucked. I don't understand it.

794
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:29,504
I'm just surprised that you even
want to stay there tonight, Beck.

795
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:33,379
During the day I'm fine. It's just... at night.

796
00:51:34,754 --> 00:51:38,254
But it's not like what happened
here happened six months ago.

797
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:40,754
I have to keep telling myself that.

798
00:51:46,129 --> 00:51:46,879
Hey, um.

799
00:51:48,254 --> 00:51:51,254
When you read the articles
in the Collingswood Post...

800
00:51:52,254 --> 00:51:55,504
...Did anything catch your eye?
I mean, did you happen to see anything?

801
00:51:57,004 --> 00:51:59,004
I could've swore I saw...

802
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:01,379
What?

803
00:52:03,004 --> 00:52:03,754
Nothing.

804
00:52:04,504 --> 00:52:05,879
It's getting to you.

805
00:52:06,629 --> 00:52:08,254
Like me with that psychic.

806
00:52:09,504 --> 00:52:12,629
I don't know what to tell you, Beck.
I mean, this is too weird.

807
00:52:13,379 --> 00:52:15,629
Do you think she knows about what happened here?

808
00:52:16,879 --> 00:52:19,879
- I mean, since the judge was supposedly a part of that cult.
- I know.

809
00:52:19,879 --> 00:52:23,129
It almost makes me want to call her back
just for the hell of it and see if she does.

810
00:52:24,629 --> 00:52:25,754
Who is she?

811
00:52:26,504 --> 00:52:29,879
- She's a spooky broad, I'll tell you that much.
- She did want me to call her.

812
00:52:32,254 --> 00:52:35,879
Maybe she'll still do that free seance
thing that she claimed she'd do.

813
00:52:37,504 --> 00:52:38,379
Here's her number.

814
00:52:38,379 --> 00:52:41,379
It's Saturday night, Beck!
Can't we think of anything better to do?

815
00:52:41,879 --> 00:52:44,129
I'm thinking maybe we just shouldn't mess with it.

816
00:52:44,754 --> 00:52:45,754
Maybe we should.

817
00:52:47,629 --> 00:52:48,629
We need to know.

818
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,004
You're not going anywhere, are you?

819
00:52:55,754 --> 00:52:56,379
Come on.

820
00:52:57,754 --> 00:52:58,754
I'll call you right back.

821
00:52:58,754 --> 00:53:01,754
Hey, be safe.

822
00:53:18,879 --> 00:53:23,129
"Welcome to my paranormal realm where psychic
secrets and desires..."

823
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:37,004
It's me. We talked last night.

824
00:53:39,879 --> 00:53:41,754
Some of the that things you said...

825
00:53:45,379 --> 00:53:47,754
John and I just really want to
know what the hell is going on.

826
00:53:48,879 --> 00:53:49,504
Sorry?

827
00:53:55,129 --> 00:53:58,129
The underground cult that you told John about...

828
00:54:00,379 --> 00:54:03,504
- It was from France wasn't it?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

829
00:54:04,504 --> 00:54:07,504
The judge that lived here, in this house...

830
00:54:09,129 --> 00:54:10,254
...He was a member.

831
00:54:10,254 --> 00:54:11,879
I don't know what you're talking about.

832
00:54:11,879 --> 00:54:17,004
Malcolm Hawks was a member
of the cult that you told John about.

833
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,129
I never told anyone about any...

834
00:54:19,129 --> 00:54:19,879
What?

835
00:54:19,879 --> 00:54:20,879
You're mistaken.

836
00:54:21,629 --> 00:54:22,629
Yes, you did. Last night.

837
00:54:22,629 --> 00:54:24,504
Look, would you like a reading or not?

838
00:54:24,504 --> 00:54:26,129
I have other callers.

839
00:54:29,254 --> 00:54:31,129
Wait a minute. Don't you know who I...?

840
00:54:31,129 --> 00:54:34,254
- Mm mm.
- I'm Rebecca from Collingswood, New Jersey.

841
00:54:34,254 --> 00:54:36,504
The, the receptive one.

842
00:54:38,504 --> 00:54:40,004
You know who I am.

843
00:54:46,254 --> 00:54:51,754
My disclaimer clearly states that
this is for entertainment purposes only.

844
00:54:52,754 --> 00:54:53,504
What?

845
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:57,129
What are you saying?

846
00:54:58,379 --> 00:54:59,379
What are you saying?

847
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,004
It's for entertainment purposes only.

848
00:55:02,754 --> 00:55:05,004
No. We took you serious!

849
00:55:07,379 --> 00:55:10,379
- I can't believe this! So what was it? Some sick joke?
- Goodbye.

850
00:55:10,379 --> 00:55:11,629
And God bless.

851
00:55:19,879 --> 00:55:20,629
What?

852
00:55:21,129 --> 00:55:22,129
Beck, what?

853
00:55:22,129 --> 00:55:25,504
She didn't even remember
me or telling you about anything.

854
00:55:26,754 --> 00:55:32,504
She gave me some line about her disclaimer
about it being for entertainment purposes only.

855
00:55:33,254 --> 00:55:34,629
It was all a sick joke.

856
00:55:34,629 --> 00:55:37,629
- Well, last night, I mean, she was really serious.
- It was all an act.

857
00:55:37,629 --> 00:55:39,129
Beck, she knew about Collingswood.

858
00:55:39,129 --> 00:55:42,629
Well, obviously she digs stuff up once she finds out where
the caller's calling from.

859
00:55:44,129 --> 00:55:46,754
I don't know, it's kind of convincing for some act.

860
00:55:46,754 --> 00:55:48,129
She's sick, John.

861
00:55:48,129 --> 00:55:51,254
Why would she go to so much trouble?
I mean, what does she get out of it?

862
00:55:51,629 --> 00:55:53,379
Some cheap thrill, apparently.

863
00:55:55,129 --> 00:55:56,254
She's messed up.

864
00:55:58,004 --> 00:56:00,754
- I don't know. It's not right.
- I'm so pissed.

865
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:07,629
Anyway...

866
00:56:09,504 --> 00:56:11,629
...It's been an interesting distraction.

867
00:56:11,629 --> 00:56:14,754
Otherwise I'd be pulling my hair
out with all this fucking homework.

868
00:56:16,254 --> 00:56:17,254
You make a dent?

869
00:56:18,379 --> 00:56:20,754
Still have all day tomorrow
what I don't finish tonight, so...

870
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:22,379
Huh...

871
00:56:37,004 --> 00:56:37,754
Beck.

872
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:39,879
Hello?

873
00:56:43,879 --> 00:56:45,254
They're in this book.

874
00:56:45,754 --> 00:56:46,754
What?

875
00:56:47,879 --> 00:56:49,754
Antique post cards, I guess.

876
00:57:00,129 --> 00:57:01,629
Let me see those again.

877
00:57:01,629 --> 00:57:05,129
That thing the ghost is holding. It's one of those.

878
00:57:09,004 --> 00:57:12,004
Didn't Vera tell you they found one of
those in that house on Lee's Lane?

879
00:57:19,379 --> 00:57:21,004
On est pas mort...

880
00:57:29,504 --> 00:57:32,879
At one point during our first conversation
Vera mumbled something in French.

881
00:57:35,504 --> 00:57:37,379
The cult originated in France.

882
00:57:40,629 --> 00:57:43,129
I might be crazy but I think this is...

883
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,754
No. It can't be.

884
00:57:47,754 --> 00:57:49,129
What's going on?

885
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:51,879
She needs to talk.

886
00:57:52,504 --> 00:57:53,379
No.

887
00:57:54,129 --> 00:57:57,129
What if... Beck, what if they're...

888
00:57:57,754 --> 00:57:59,754
What if they never left this weekend?!

889
00:58:01,254 --> 00:58:02,754
What if they're fucking with you?!

890
00:58:03,254 --> 00:58:04,629
I don't think it's them.

891
00:58:04,629 --> 00:58:06,754
Then it's Vera. I mean, it's gotta be!

892
00:58:08,254 --> 00:58:10,754
John, don't call her! You can't
trust anything she says! John!

893
00:58:21,379 --> 00:58:22,129
Vera!

894
00:58:23,004 --> 00:58:24,129
Vera Madeline!

895
00:58:49,004 --> 00:58:51,129
She's on break or she’s just not answering.

896
00:58:51,879 --> 00:58:52,879
Drop it.

897
00:58:52,879 --> 00:58:56,504
Beck, she's up to something. I'm
not gonna let her get away with that!

898
00:58:57,254 --> 00:58:59,129
I want to forget about her.

899
00:59:02,379 --> 00:59:04,004
Ok, Beck, look.

900
00:59:04,754 --> 00:59:07,254
Just to be on the safe side
I think I should drive down.

901
00:59:07,254 --> 00:59:08,004
Why?

902
00:59:08,004 --> 00:59:11,754
I don't like the idea of you being there
alone. I'd feel a lot better if I was there.

903
00:59:12,379 --> 00:59:14,879
That means you won't get up here until 4:00 am.

904
00:59:14,879 --> 00:59:16,879
You really feel like driving 8 hours tonight?

905
00:59:17,504 --> 00:59:19,379
I already threw some stuff in a book bag.

906
00:59:20,004 --> 00:59:22,254
Look, I can get somebody to
cover for me at work tomorrow.

907
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:23,754
Look, John, I'm set.

908
00:59:24,754 --> 00:59:25,879
Thanks, though.

909
00:59:26,754 --> 00:59:27,504
Beck.

910
00:59:28,379 --> 00:59:30,754
Do you remember the last
time you told me you were set?

911
00:59:30,754 --> 00:59:33,254
We went fishing and you
got trashed on Jello shots?

912
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:35,879
You had to carry me all the way down to the car.

913
00:59:37,129 --> 00:59:39,254
And you threw up all over my jacket.

914
00:59:40,629 --> 00:59:44,379
Hey, I just want you to
know that I'm there for you.

915
00:59:52,004 --> 00:59:53,879
I haven't eaten since this morning.

916
00:59:54,629 --> 00:59:59,754
I'm really tired. So, I'm gonna
go out and get something.

917
01:00:02,754 --> 01:00:03,504
Ok.

918
01:00:04,629 --> 01:00:06,129
That sounds like a good idea.

919
01:00:07,254 --> 01:00:08,504
Thanks, John.

920
01:00:09,004 --> 01:00:09,629
Bye.

921
01:00:23,129 --> 01:00:24,254
Hi, John.

922
01:00:26,004 --> 01:00:32,004
Guess it's kind of pointless, but, I figure as
long as I'm out here, Might as well try to find it.

923
01:00:35,004 --> 01:00:36,754
Talking about finding Lee's Lane.

924
01:00:49,629 --> 01:00:51,254
Someone's been having fun.

925
01:00:56,129 --> 01:00:57,504
Wooooo.

926
01:00:58,629 --> 01:00:59,504
Look!

927
01:01:09,504 --> 01:01:12,129
Listen, lady. What the hell are you doing to us?

928
01:01:12,129 --> 01:01:15,629
You... You can not be messing
with me and my girlfriend!

929
01:01:15,629 --> 01:01:19,879
- Alright? What do you think...
- They didn't know what was going on. They didn't know what was happening.

930
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,879
Their father put them in the bathtub.

931
01:01:26,504 --> 01:01:28,629
Put their heads down in the water.

932
01:01:30,754 --> 01:01:32,754
He had to do it.

933
01:01:32,754 --> 01:01:34,504
It was their only escape.

934
01:01:35,629 --> 01:01:38,254
It was their only escape from Alan Tashi.

935
01:01:40,504 --> 01:01:42,129
Tell her to get out.

936
01:01:42,129 --> 01:01:43,879
Her life depends on it.

937
01:02:14,754 --> 01:02:16,504
It's so quiet.

938
01:02:23,504 --> 01:02:24,879
"They're over here."

939
01:02:36,629 --> 01:02:38,879
I don't think I told you this, John.

940
01:02:40,629 --> 01:02:43,629
Supposedly the cult holds meetings here at night.

941
01:02:50,254 --> 01:02:53,129
You have to get her out of there.
Get her out of there now.

942
01:02:53,129 --> 01:02:55,879
- Wait. How come you didn't say this to Beck before.
- She's in danger. I couldn't talk then.

943
01:02:55,879 --> 01:02:57,254
It was too dangerous.

944
01:02:57,879 --> 01:02:58,379
What?

945
01:02:59,879 --> 01:03:02,254
They practice the rites in the attic.

946
01:03:03,254 --> 01:03:06,254
You don't believe me.
There are scars left behind.

947
01:03:06,754 --> 01:03:08,129
You'll find them.

948
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:13,129
Look, lady, we'll be ok, alright?

949
01:03:14,504 --> 01:03:16,504
I'm definitely driving to Jersey tonight.

950
01:03:17,004 --> 01:03:20,004
She wants me there.
She just thinks it's too late for me to be driving.

951
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,879
She’s just going through
the motions. Don't you see?

952
01:03:23,879 --> 01:03:25,754
She doesn't care for you anymore.

953
01:03:26,254 --> 01:03:27,504
She's got him.

954
01:04:09,504 --> 01:04:12,504
Lee's Lane. I found it!

955
01:04:16,129 --> 01:04:18,004
It's gotta be the next one.

956
01:04:25,504 --> 01:04:27,004
Oh my god!

957
01:04:27,879 --> 01:04:28,754
John!

958
01:04:29,879 --> 01:04:31,879
This is where Alan Tashi lived!

959
01:04:37,754 --> 01:04:39,629
I wonder where the well used to be.

960
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:44,629
I'm outta here.

961
01:04:48,254 --> 01:04:49,504
Oh my god!

962
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Don't go near her.
What?
Stay away from her.

963
01:04:58,254 --> 01:05:00,254
Stay away from her!

964
01:05:00,254 --> 01:05:01,629
Stay away from her.

965
01:05:03,879 --> 01:05:05,004
Oh, God!

966
01:05:09,754 --> 01:05:11,004
Hey, it's me.

967
01:05:12,879 --> 01:05:13,879
Bullseye.

968
01:05:14,254 --> 01:05:15,129
Found it.

969
01:05:20,629 --> 01:05:21,754
The house.

970
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:26,379
It's pretty dark. Let me know if it turns
out. I'll upload them for you in a minute.

971
01:05:27,129 --> 01:05:29,004
They practice rituals in the attic.

972
01:05:32,754 --> 01:05:33,504
Huh?

973
01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:38,754
John, you didn't.

974
01:05:39,629 --> 01:05:40,504
Tell me you...

975
01:05:41,254 --> 01:05:43,129
- Why would you call her again? She's...
- She called me.

976
01:05:43,129 --> 01:05:44,254
To say what?

977
01:05:45,129 --> 01:05:46,129
You know what.

978
01:05:49,004 --> 01:05:52,004
My, God, one minute you don't
believe her and the next minute you do?

979
01:05:52,754 --> 01:05:55,754
Alright, look, Beck, be honest with
me, alright? Don't fuck with me!

980
01:05:55,754 --> 01:05:58,379
Don't talk to me like that. I have
always been honest with you.

981
01:06:00,129 --> 01:06:02,004
I don't need this right now.

982
01:06:04,754 --> 01:06:07,129
John? What's going on here?

983
01:06:08,129 --> 01:06:09,879
- What did she say?
- It's over isn't it?

984
01:06:10,879 --> 01:06:13,004
Beck, she was right. You're
just going through the motions.

985
01:06:13,004 --> 01:06:15,254
You believe some cheap psychic over me?

986
01:06:16,129 --> 01:06:18,754
John, she gets off on
fucking with people's heads.

987
01:06:19,754 --> 01:06:20,879
And you know something?

988
01:06:21,379 --> 01:06:23,254
That's what it feels like
your starting to do with me.

989
01:06:26,504 --> 01:06:28,629
Maybe this whole thing wasn't
such a good idea after all.

990
01:06:30,629 --> 01:06:33,379
Don't let that old bitch get
to you. It's what she wants.

991
01:06:37,254 --> 01:06:39,629
There's too many things that
are right on with what she said.

992
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:42,129
Too many signs, Beck. It's all proof.

993
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:46,254
You really think they had the rituals up there?

994
01:06:51,004 --> 01:06:51,629
Ok.

995
01:06:52,879 --> 01:06:54,129
I'll go find the attic and look around.

996
01:06:54,129 --> 01:06:55,629
No, Beck! That's not what I want!

997
01:06:56,754 --> 01:06:59,004
Well, then, what is it that
you want me to do? What?

998
01:06:59,504 --> 01:07:00,254
Tell me.

999
01:07:00,254 --> 01:07:01,504
Just get out of there!

1000
01:07:01,504 --> 01:07:03,129
Just for tonight! Go back tomorrow!

1001
01:07:04,004 --> 01:07:05,504
- Talk to you in a bit, John.
- Beck!

1002
01:07:11,879 --> 01:07:13,129
Ok, John. You there?

1003
01:07:14,754 --> 01:07:15,754
Yeah.

1004
01:07:17,004 --> 01:07:18,254
Took me forever to find it.

1005
01:07:19,129 --> 01:07:21,379
It's above the toilet in the guest bathroom.

1006
01:07:25,254 --> 01:07:27,254
I had to plug into a line in their bedroom.

1007
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:29,754
Ok, you know what?

1008
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:31,379
I believe you.

1009
01:07:31,879 --> 01:07:32,879
Nothing happened.

1010
01:07:33,629 --> 01:07:35,004
Just don't go up there.

1011
01:07:36,254 --> 01:07:38,504
I already lugged this
ladder in from the garage.

1012
01:07:39,004 --> 01:07:39,754
Beck...

1013
01:07:42,629 --> 01:07:44,629
...This is the bathroom
where he put his kids.

1014
01:07:46,504 --> 01:07:48,254
Creep me out some more, why don't you?

1015
01:08:27,879 --> 01:08:28,629
Be careful.

1016
01:08:55,129 --> 01:08:56,879
Can't even stand up in here.

1017
01:09:10,004 --> 01:09:11,379
Where are you? I can't see you?

1018
01:09:12,129 --> 01:09:13,379
The phone cord is stuck.

1019
01:09:13,879 --> 01:09:14,754
Hang on.

1020
01:09:21,754 --> 01:09:22,754
Hang on.

1021
01:09:27,754 --> 01:09:30,379
If we get disconnected, I'll call you back.
Stay by the phone.

1022
01:09:30,379 --> 01:09:31,254
Ok, Beck.

1023
01:09:39,629 --> 01:09:41,504
Hey, I'm looking...

1024
01:09:42,379 --> 01:09:43,629
...Not seeing any-

1025
01:09:44,129 --> 01:09:45,254
Can't even see it.

1026
01:10:02,879 --> 01:10:04,004
Beck, what is it?

1027
01:10:05,754 --> 01:10:06,629
I think I might've...

1028
01:10:22,379 --> 01:10:23,379
It's a door.

1029
01:10:23,379 --> 01:10:24,254
What?

1030
01:10:38,504 --> 01:10:39,254
Beck.

1031
01:10:48,379 --> 01:10:49,504
What's in there?

1032
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:50,754
Hang on.

1033
01:10:52,129 --> 01:10:53,504
- Beck, what do you-
- Hang on.

1034
01:11:10,629 --> 01:11:11,504
Beck.

1035
01:11:17,504 --> 01:11:18,379
What's in there?

1036
01:11:18,379 --> 01:11:19,254
John...

1037
01:11:31,254 --> 01:11:32,129
What is this?

1038
01:11:43,504 --> 01:11:44,254
What's in that thing?

1039
01:11:44,254 --> 01:11:45,629
How do I know?

1040
01:11:58,254 --> 01:11:59,754
Maybe this is the room where they...

1041
01:12:06,879 --> 01:12:08,129
- Beck.
- Hang on.

1042
01:12:16,504 --> 01:12:17,504
Don't open that.

1043
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:23,629
Now what are you doing?

1044
01:12:23,629 --> 01:12:25,004
I wanna check this out some more.

1045
01:12:34,504 --> 01:12:35,629
Just get out of there.

1046
01:12:35,629 --> 01:12:37,254
You've been in there long enough.

1047
01:12:39,754 --> 01:12:41,504
You don't think it's cool in here?

1048
01:12:41,504 --> 01:12:42,379
I don't know...

1049
01:12:42,379 --> 01:12:43,379
Hang on.

1050
01:12:51,254 --> 01:12:52,004
Beck!

1051
01:12:52,504 --> 01:12:53,129
Hang on.

1052
01:12:54,504 --> 01:12:56,504
I just, I really think you
should get out of there now.

1053
01:12:56,504 --> 01:12:57,504
In a minute!

1054
01:13:10,004 --> 01:13:11,004
Beck, what is it?

1055
01:13:15,379 --> 01:13:16,254
I don't know.

1056
01:13:46,629 --> 01:13:47,629
Oh my god!

1057
01:13:48,379 --> 01:13:50,004
Oh my god!

1058
01:13:50,004 --> 01:13:51,379
Who could be calling?

1059
01:13:52,129 --> 01:13:53,129
Beck, see who it is?

1060
01:13:58,504 --> 01:14:00,879
- Aren't the scars enough to warn you?
- How did you get my number?

1061
01:14:00,879 --> 01:14:02,504
What are you still doing there?

1062
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:05,629
- What do you want from us?
- Get out of the house, Rebecca. Please.

1063
01:14:05,629 --> 01:14:06,629
What do you want?

1064
01:14:06,629 --> 01:14:08,754
You're crazy, ok? Leave me alone!

1065
01:14:08,754 --> 01:14:09,629
I got away.

1066
01:14:10,629 --> 01:14:12,879
He loved me too. Look at me.

1067
01:14:24,379 --> 01:14:25,754
Be afraid of his love.

1068
01:14:30,129 --> 01:14:31,504
Be afraid of it.

1069
01:14:33,254 --> 01:14:35,004
He'll cut your eyes out.

1070
01:14:36,129 --> 01:14:38,379
Do you see what this is all about now?

1071
01:14:39,004 --> 01:14:40,879
Go before it's too late.

1072
01:14:40,879 --> 01:14:42,379
You don't know what you're talking about.

1073
01:14:42,754 --> 01:14:44,879
- Wait, don't hang up. Listen.
- Please, just leave me alone!

1074
01:14:44,879 --> 01:14:46,504
I don't understand what you're-

1075
01:14:46,504 --> 01:14:47,379
God...

1076
01:14:51,629 --> 01:14:53,004
He'll cut your eyes out!

1077
01:14:55,629 --> 01:14:56,879
Who was it?

1078
01:15:00,004 --> 01:15:02,004
- Vera?
- Everybody leave me the fuck alone!

1079
01:15:02,004 --> 01:15:03,004
What did she say?

1080
01:15:03,004 --> 01:15:04,754
I wanna get out of here.

1081
01:15:04,754 --> 01:15:05,879
Beck, what?

1082
01:15:07,629 --> 01:15:08,504
Jesus, Beck!

1083
01:15:19,754 --> 01:15:21,004
What the fuck is going on?!

1084
01:15:25,629 --> 01:15:27,004
Someone was up here.

1085
01:15:29,754 --> 01:15:31,254
Christ, Beck! Get out of there!

1086
01:15:33,129 --> 01:15:35,379
- How do I get out of here?
- What are you waiting for? Get out of there!

1087
01:15:38,754 --> 01:15:39,879
How do I get out of here?

1088
01:15:41,129 --> 01:15:42,004
I can't-

1089
01:15:46,129 --> 01:15:46,879
Rebecca...

1090
01:15:48,629 --> 01:15:49,504
Rebecca!

1091
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:51,379
Rebecca...

1092
01:15:53,504 --> 01:15:54,254
Rebecca.

1093
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
- I can't get out!
- Jesus, Beck! You gotta get out of there!
- Is this really happening?
- Just go!

1094
01:16:04,754 --> 01:16:05,879
Who is it?

1095
01:16:08,254 --> 01:16:09,004
Beck!

1096
01:16:18,379 --> 01:16:19,754
I can't see!

1097
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:24,879
Where is he?

1098
01:16:27,754 --> 01:16:30,004
Oh my God! What the fuck is going on?!

1099
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:32,129
Where is he?!

1100
01:16:36,629 --> 01:16:37,629
Rebecca!

1101
01:16:37,629 --> 01:16:38,754
Don't! Please!

1102
01:16:39,754 --> 01:16:42,254
Stay where I can see you!
Stay where I can see you!

1103
01:16:57,629 --> 01:16:59,379
Beck, tell him to stop!

1104
01:16:59,379 --> 01:17:01,004
Tell him to stop!
