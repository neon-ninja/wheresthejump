00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:05,099
Cooper!

3
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,647
Who paints a room pink?

4
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:51,332
Wait, wait...

5
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:57,001
Don't look at me like that.

6
00:04:57,003 --> 00:04:59,140
You're the one that's gonna
have to shit that out later.

7
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:26,801
Oh.

8
00:05:57,229 --> 00:05:59,229
Piece of cake.

9
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:01,301
Jesus Christ!

10
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:09,840
Doorbell needs fixing.

11
00:06:09,842 --> 00:06:10,878
Bourbon?

12
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:13,981
What brings you
out to the suburbs?

13
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:16,780
Change of scenery.

14
00:06:16,782 --> 00:06:19,116
Uh, my wife and I
got a baby on the way,

15
00:06:19,118 --> 00:06:21,453
and this guy needed a yard.

16
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:22,486
Thought a little bit
of elbow room

17
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:23,987
would do everybody
some good.

18
00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:25,890
Family's good.

19
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:27,025
Dirt's good.

20
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:29,393
Kids can't grow up right
without some mud on their jeans

21
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:32,030
and a frog
in their pocket.

22
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:34,234
What about you?
Do you live around here?

23
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:37,268
Since '84,

24
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,138
long enough to see
my fair share of things

25
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,875
come and go.

26
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,475
So you're a nun...?

27
00:06:44,477 --> 00:06:47,845
Good Lord.

28
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:50,948
I remember Chicago being
more progressive than that.

29
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,883
No, we're Protestant.

30
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:54,486
I'm the pastor.

31
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:56,087
I apologize.
I should've known.

32
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,455
My wife and I
aren't very religious.

33
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,193
- I just didn't...
- Don't sweat it, slick.

34
00:07:00,092 --> 00:07:02,128
We're more laidback
out here.

35
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:05,265
And my door
is always open,

36
00:07:05,998 --> 00:07:07,835
if you care to learn more.

37
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:30,354
Hey, Bunny!

38
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:32,827
<i>Hi, Tiger.
How was your first night?</i>

39
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:36,227
Oh, great.
Look at this place.

40
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:38,830
<i>Did you just wake up?</i>

41
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:41,202
Hey, how's the
little kicker doing?

42
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:43,404
<i>Say hi to Daddy.</i>

43
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:50,174
Hey, little Pumpkin Head.

44
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:51,475
<i>Oh my God,
you're not calling your daughter</i>

45
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:52,544
<i>"Pumpkin Head."
Please.</i>

46
00:07:52,546 --> 00:07:54,011
Oh, come on, babe.

47
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:56,047
You've seen the size
of your belly.

48
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:58,085
That's the only explanation.

49
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,085
<i>So, what's on
the agenda today?</i>

50
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:02,453
<i>How's the schedule looking?</i>

51
00:08:02,455 --> 00:08:03,821
Oh, the schedule
feels great.

52
00:08:03,823 --> 00:08:05,556
I will finish this room

53
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:06,624
as soon as I'm off
the phone with you

54
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:09,326
and I'll move on to the
kitchen in the afternoon.

55
00:08:09,328 --> 00:08:11,996
<i>So what, like painting,
sanding,</i>

56
00:08:11,998 --> 00:08:14,933
<i>opening that giant
gaping hole?</i>

57
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:17,035
<i>Ugh, are you sure
you don't want me</i>

58
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:19,070
<i>to call in some pros,
Don?</i>

59
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:20,237
<i>This is a lot of work.</i>

60
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,405
No, we're not
calling anybody.

61
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:22,407
I got this.

62
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:23,407
How could I sleep at night

63
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:26,109
knowing some other jerkwad
built your castle?

64
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,315
<i>Well, you'd sleep because
the roof wouldn't leak.</i>

65
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:31,185
<i>What's that?</i>

66
00:08:33,452 --> 00:08:35,286
Oh, there's piles of junk
all over this place.

67
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:37,154
Please don't be paranoid.

68
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:38,489
<i>I trust you.</i>

69
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:39,556
<i>Shit, I got to go.</i>

70
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:41,893
<i>I've got, um,
team's proposals at ten.</i>

71
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,628
<i>Anyway, I'll call you
tonight, okay?</i>

72
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,863
<i>Love you.</i>

73
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:46,096
<i>Mwah.</i>

74
00:08:46,098 --> 00:08:47,565
<i>Mwah.</i>

75
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,135
<i>Bye.</i>

76
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,441
<i>"So once you get
your drywall size,</i>

77
00:08:57,443 --> 00:08:59,210
<i>you want to
just check by hand</i>

78
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:02,213
<i>and see where does
the drywall give in?</i>

79
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:05,853
<i>Now, luckily, it's only
a small section..."</i>

What the hell?

95
00:10:14,654 --> 00:10:17,357
Oh, piece of shit drill,
motherfucker!

96
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,552
Ow!

97
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,222
Oh, God!

98
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:01,635
How's it going,
Mr. Koch?

99
00:11:05,204 --> 00:11:06,940
Change of pace, huh?

100
00:11:07,674 --> 00:11:09,706
Something like that.

101
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,442
How's a guy like you
planning to survive out here?

102
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:13,643
I'll figure it out.

103
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:16,047
Can't imagine there's
much of a nightlife.

104
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,316
No fancy supper clubs.

105
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:20,118
No strippers
to woo clients with.

106
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,085
Uh, there's plenty
of strippers.

107
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:23,354
I just don't have any
clients left to woo.

108
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:24,622
True.

109
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:26,391
Which begs the question,

110
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:28,996
how exactly can you
afford this place?

111
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:33,764
Good old Liz.

112
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:36,433
Yeah. I like her.

113
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:38,402
Smart woman.

114
00:11:38,404 --> 00:11:40,204
How's she accepting
this change?

115
00:11:40,206 --> 00:11:42,739
She will keep her
company running

116
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:45,176
and she'll commute
once the baby's born.

117
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:47,077
You know, it's not like
our life's over.

118
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,513
It's just...

119
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:49,680
...it's maturing.

120
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:51,382
It'd better be, Don.

121
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:53,183
Feds cut you one hell
of a sweetheart deal,

122
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:54,652
all things considered.

123
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:57,057
Be a shame if you
fucked it all up again.

124
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:00,557
That it?

125
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,526
Yeah.

126
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:03,197
That's the last of it.

127
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,332
That's a beautiful church.

128
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:49,510
Oh, shit!

129
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:11,531
You gonna be okay?

130
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:17,471
Don't shit in the house.

131
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:13,260
Goddamn machine
likes to eat balls.

132
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:17,195
You hungry or thirsty?

133
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:18,696
Both.

134
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:20,730
Cocktails I have
some control over.

135
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:22,768
Food can be hit or miss.

136
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,269
Well let's start
with a drink, then.

137
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:27,840
Smart man.

138
00:14:35,648 --> 00:14:37,248
It's not bad.

139
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,352
I'll quote you
in the next ad.

140
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:43,753
So, uh,
are you visiting or lost?

141
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:44,821
Resident.

142
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:46,859
I, uh, just bought the house
on Saul and Circle.

143
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:52,830
What?

144
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:54,532
You queer?

145
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:55,532
Excuse me?

146
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:57,500
It's a simple question.

147
00:14:57,502 --> 00:14:58,301
Yeah, I'm about
to have a kid.

148
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,604
What kind of
a question is that?

149
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:00,372
Easy, Don.

150
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:02,473
Gay people
can have kids, too.

151
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:04,374
Nothing wrong with that.

152
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:06,512
I know that.
I...

153
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:08,749
I'm happily married.

154
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:10,981
Of course, you are.

155
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:12,385
I'm sorry.

156
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:17,888
That house just seems to be
bad news for straight men.

157
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,894
Uh, but, uh,
I'm sure you'll be fine.

158
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:26,232
How about a shot?

159
00:15:31,837 --> 00:15:33,604
You've got a real fucked up
way of welcoming people

160
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:35,509
to the neighborhood,
Geary.

161
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:50,824
Cooper!

162
00:16:42,842 --> 00:16:44,678
Cooper!

163
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Cooper?

164
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,630
Shit!

165
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:07,967
You really suck,
you know that?

166
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:10,967
<i>You know,
Cleo and Jason</i>

167
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:12,903
<i>brought up the Hyde Park
Project again.</i>

168
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:14,871
<i>So frustrating</i>

169
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:16,610
<i>to keep having
to telling them no.</i>

170
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:18,708
<i>You know what I also hate?</i>

171
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,579
<i>Having to pee all the time.</i>

172
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:23,013
<i>God, if these things
get any more swollen</i>

173
00:17:23,015 --> 00:17:25,384
<i>I won't be able to
stand up straight.</i>

174
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:28,686
<i>So, how is it going
over there?</i>

175
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:30,521
Great.
I got a ton done today.

176
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:32,122
I'm feeling positive
about it.

177
00:17:32,124 --> 00:17:34,425
<i>That's wonderful, babe.</i>

178
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:35,996
<i>How's the kitchen
shaping up?</i>

179
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:38,529
Well, I actually
didn't make it

180
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:39,563
into the kitchen today,

181
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:42,832
but it is the first thing
on tomorrow's list.

182
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:44,033
<i>Are you sure you
don't need some</i>

183
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:45,836
<i>extra hands, babe?</i>

184
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:47,103
I'm sure, Bunny.

185
00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:48,539
Everything's going fine.

186
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,108
Don't forget Milo's
coming up this weekend.

187
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,776
But if you wanna help,

188
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:54,578
you can do me a favor
right now.

189
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,411
<i>What's that?</i>

190
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:56,880
Just tilt that
phone down to those

191
00:17:56,882 --> 00:17:59,385
beautiful boobs
one more time.

192
00:18:01,787 --> 00:18:04,123
<i>That's all you get
until I see a finished kitchen.</i>

193
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:06,189
<i>All right.
Good night.</i>

194
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:07,760
<i>Mwah!</i>

195
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:16,199
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

196
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:19,536
<i>I've been such a naughty,
naughty girl.</i>

197
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:22,475
<i>You always know
exactly how to treat me.</i>

198
00:18:24,177 --> 00:18:26,980
<i>Oh, I'll do whatever
you say, Daddy.</i>

199
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:30,613
<i>Are you gonna punish me?</i>

200
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:31,784
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

201
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:35,488
<i>I've been such a naughty,
naughty girl.</i>

202
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:04,484
Hey, hey, out!

203
00:19:58,537 --> 00:19:59,839
That looks terrific.

204
00:20:01,673 --> 00:20:03,640
Old pipes.

205
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:05,178
They don't look so old.

206
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:11,282
Can I help you
with something?

207
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:13,216
I just like it here.

208
00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:15,051
- What?
- The house.

209
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:16,753
It's usually empty.

210
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:19,156
Oh, well, I bought it.

211
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:20,760
So it's not empty anymore.

212
00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:23,529
Hmm, shame.

213
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:29,766
Uh, I'd better get
back inside.

214
00:20:29,768 --> 00:20:31,936
Sure.
No problem.

215
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:33,640
See you around.

216
00:21:25,224 --> 00:21:27,561
<i>♪ Distill</i>

217
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,298
<i>♪ Distill</i>

218
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:41,174
<i>♪ Break them all down</i>

219

221
00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:56,221

<i>♪ Distill ♪</i>

223
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,061
Fuck!

224
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:58,111
Oh, Christ.

225
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:24,337
Still smoke, Dad?

226
00:24:26,971 --> 00:24:28,871
And in here,
we will change this wallpaper

227
00:24:28,873 --> 00:24:31,308
to something
a lot less hideous.

228
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,812
Who's "we?"

229
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:36,815
My wife and I.

230
00:24:38,484 --> 00:24:41,584
Are you sure?
It's very retro.

231
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:43,489
You might end up
regretting it.

232
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,090
Uh, well, I'll let you know
if we lose any sleep over it.

233
00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:49,963
A man who never
second-guesses himself, huh?

234
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:52,165
What's this?

235
00:24:53,098 --> 00:24:54,298
Now, this...

236
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,965
This is retro.

237
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:58,837
A tiny closet?

238
00:25:16,322 --> 00:25:18,621
Please tell me you guys
are keeping this.

239
00:25:18,623 --> 00:25:20,424
Entire reason
I bought the house.

240
00:25:20,426 --> 00:25:22,395
You have great taste.

241
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,534
What's in here?

242
00:25:31,937 --> 00:25:33,337
- White?
- Oh, you got me.

243
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:34,503
The wife picked it out.

244
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:36,540
I think it was called
"French Vanilla"

245
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:37,574
or something like that.

246
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:40,310
It's supposed to be
next year's trendy color.

247
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:42,115
Hmm.

248
00:25:42,948 --> 00:25:45,118
Anything else
you wanna show me?

249
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:57,628
Can you do me a favor?

250
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,329
<i>What's that?</i>

251
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:00,664
<i>Choke me.</i>

252
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:02,302
<i>Hmm.</i>

253
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:32,297
This dress looked
better on the floor.

254
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,636
That was even better
than I hoped for.

255
00:26:57,022 --> 00:26:59,255
Oh, don't look
at me like that.

256
00:26:59,257 --> 00:27:00,425
I earned that.

257
00:28:00,486 --> 00:28:01,752
<i>That is insane!</i>

258
00:28:01,754 --> 00:28:04,754
I know.
Well, check this out.

259
00:28:04,756 --> 00:28:07,256
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

260
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:09,559
I don't know.
Bleachers?

261
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:12,195
Hey, maybe they heard about
how hot our sex life is

262
00:28:12,197 --> 00:28:13,362
and had them installed,
huh?

263
00:28:13,364 --> 00:28:15,398
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

264
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,134
<i>I just don't understand
how you missed this</i>

265
00:28:17,136 --> 00:28:18,404
<i>during the appraisal.</i>

266
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:22,472
You were here too,
and these weren't.

267
00:28:22,474 --> 00:28:24,541
<i>I'm gonna call
the real estate agent.</i>

268
00:28:24,543 --> 00:28:25,408
Why?

269
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,244
What is she going to do?
They're here.

270
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:28,779
<i>Because I want them gone.</i>

271
00:28:28,781 --> 00:28:30,446
<i>The ceiling repair is gonna
cost time and money</i>

272
00:28:30,448 --> 00:28:32,049
- <i>and we should be compensated.</i>
- Bunny...

273
00:28:32,051 --> 00:28:34,150
Bunny, relax, okay?
This is an easy fix.

274
00:28:34,152 --> 00:28:36,419
It's probably just
a shoddy patch, all right?

275
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:37,554
<i>No structural damage.</i>

276
00:28:37,556 --> 00:28:39,488
<i>Me and Milo can tackle this,
no problem.</i>

277
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,524
<i>Trust me, okay?</i>

278
00:28:41,526 --> 00:28:42,560
<i>I trust you, babe.</i>

279
00:28:42,562 --> 00:28:43,659
<i>I just don't want you
to bite off</i>

280
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:45,364
<i>more than you can chew.</i>

281
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:51,636
Eh, I should have got
a dumpster.

282
00:29:20,198 --> 00:29:21,633
What you doing?

283
00:29:24,203 --> 00:29:25,069
You know me,

284
00:29:25,071 --> 00:29:28,241
I'm just working hard,
cranking away.

285
00:29:28,739 --> 00:29:30,543
Sounds fun.

286
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:32,611
Want some help?

287
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:34,644
Nah.

288
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:36,245
Doing a bunch of
heavy lifting in here.

289
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:38,215
I got this.

290
00:29:38,217 --> 00:29:40,119
Okay.

291
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:48,224
Look, last night
was super-hot,

292
00:29:48,226 --> 00:29:49,725
but we shouldn't.

293
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:51,261
You know, I got to get
this place tip-top

294
00:29:51,263 --> 00:29:52,728
before the wife
and baby get here,

295
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,598
and there's still, like,

296
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,669
a laundry list
of things to do.

297
00:29:57,703 --> 00:30:01,140
True, but that's later.

298
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,609
What about right now?

299
00:30:11,816 --> 00:30:14,120
I can't.
I'm sure you understand.

300
00:30:16,588 --> 00:30:18,388
Sure.

301
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,293
I understand.

302
00:31:06,604 --> 00:31:08,571
Hey, Tiger.

303
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:10,877
- Jesus...
- Shh.

304
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

305
00:32:29,353 --> 00:32:30,389
What the fuck?

306
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

307
00:33:39,358 --> 00:33:41,360
It's Saturday, idiot.

308
00:33:42,627 --> 00:33:43,996
Nice doorbell.

309
00:33:45,096 --> 00:33:48,933
Well, that's certainly creepy.

310
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:52,004
You don't know
the half of it.

311
00:33:52,737 --> 00:33:55,138
Did you freaks pay extra
for that feature or...

312
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,473
Shut up, dick.

313
00:33:56,475 --> 00:33:57,573
We didn't know
this was there.

314
00:33:57,575 --> 00:33:59,475
Well, I don't know, man.

315
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:01,677
Turn the attic
into a guest room.

316
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,816
Airbnb it,
charge a fortune to watch.

317
00:34:05,617 --> 00:34:06,849
This is gone
by the weekend

318
00:34:06,851 --> 00:34:09,622
or there's not gonna be
a wife left to watch.

319
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:12,155
Well, for the sake
of your kid,

320
00:34:12,157 --> 00:34:14,557
we better get to work.

321
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,091
Where are your tools?

322
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:17,662
Right there.

323
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:20,863
That's it?

324
00:34:20,865 --> 00:34:22,631
You plan on renovating
an entire house

325
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:24,533
with a Swiss army knife?

326
00:34:24,535 --> 00:34:26,505
What?
Is that not enough?

327
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:29,975
No.

328
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:43,622
Lift.

329
00:34:46,957 --> 00:34:48,825
- You good?
- Yeah.

330
00:34:48,827 --> 00:34:50,160
All right.
Here we go.

331
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:51,861
How's the firm anyway?

332
00:34:51,863 --> 00:34:52,695
Shit.

333
00:34:52,697 --> 00:34:55,532
New regulations
got us by the balls.

334
00:34:55,534 --> 00:34:57,633
You got out
at the right time.

335
00:34:57,635 --> 00:35:00,003
Maybe not gracefully,
but, you know?

336
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:01,838
You still making money,
at least?

337
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,905
Not as much.

338
00:35:02,907 --> 00:35:05,207
Have to work
twice as hard for it.

339
00:35:05,209 --> 00:35:07,142
Need to find a Liz
for myself.

340
00:35:07,144 --> 00:35:09,211
It's a bad idea if you, uh,

341
00:35:09,213 --> 00:35:11,481
are afraid of hard work.

342
00:35:11,483 --> 00:35:13,682
Motherfucker, you don't
see me holding the other side

343
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:16,151
of this heavy-ass drywall
above my head?

344
00:35:16,153 --> 00:35:17,820
Free of charge,
I might add?

345
00:35:17,822 --> 00:35:19,689
Hey, listen, all the money
I've made you,

346
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:23,062
couple hours of gratis
isn't too much to ask.

347
00:35:24,796 --> 00:35:26,999
Well, you do have
a pretty nice house.

348
00:35:35,907 --> 00:35:38,778
What's next?
Applebee's?

349
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,758
Is that the wife?

350
00:35:57,762 --> 00:36:00,562
You mean this modest
motherfucker didn't tell you?

351
00:36:00,564 --> 00:36:02,198
He basically ran Chicago.

352
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,501
King Don, we called him.

353
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:05,702
I had a good run.

354
00:36:05,704 --> 00:36:06,637
Whoa.

355
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:09,905
You traded a penthouse
for a whorehouse?

356
00:36:09,907 --> 00:36:13,845
That might officially make
you the craziest man in town.

357
00:36:14,778 --> 00:36:16,713
Wait, what?

358
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:19,048
Oh, he didn't tell you?

359
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,584
King Don is the proud owner

360
00:36:21,586 --> 00:36:25,220
of Portsmith's former
house of ill repute.

361
00:36:25,222 --> 00:36:27,189
That was over
a hundred years ago.

362
00:36:27,191 --> 00:36:29,928
Well, might explain
some things, though.

363
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:32,528
Speaking of pleasure,

364
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,731
a little light on options
in here, isn't it?

365
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:37,733
You move to the suburbs
to start a family,

366
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:41,104
or because everyone thinks
you're an asshole.

367
00:36:41,106 --> 00:36:42,905
Right.
Because you're an asshole.

368
00:36:42,907 --> 00:36:45,008
Certainly there's a college
around here, right?

369
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,843
Like, I saw one or two cute
girls walking around earlier.

370
00:36:47,845 --> 00:36:48,745
No college.

371
00:36:48,747 --> 00:36:52,916
But, uh, Gwen Martin
will be in later.

372
00:36:52,918 --> 00:36:54,082
Oh?

373
00:36:54,084 --> 00:36:55,551
Who's Gwen Martin?

374
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:57,889
She runs an erotic
pottery class.

375
00:36:58,722 --> 00:37:01,090
She's a feminist, though.

376
00:37:01,092 --> 00:37:02,258
That's great.

377
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,229
I'm a feminist.

378
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,131
Me too, son.

379
00:37:26,184 --> 00:37:27,950
Promise me you won't
say a word to Liz

380
00:37:27,952 --> 00:37:29,952
about last night.

381
00:37:29,954 --> 00:37:31,954
I swore to her
I wouldn't drink.

382
00:37:31,956 --> 00:37:34,189
Bro code, bro!

383
00:37:34,191 --> 00:37:35,725
Good man.

384
00:37:35,727 --> 00:37:37,260
My head's killing me.
I need coffee.

385
00:37:37,262 --> 00:37:38,128
You want some?

386
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,698
Your assistant
already brewed a pot.

387
00:37:48,974 --> 00:37:50,276
Morning, Don.

388
00:37:54,912 --> 00:37:56,646
What the hell
are you doing here?

389
00:37:56,648 --> 00:37:57,847
I stopped by.

390
00:37:57,849 --> 00:37:59,749
Milo let me in.
What's wrong?

391
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:01,954
"What's wrong?"
Are you kidding me?

392
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:06,122
All right.
Let's get something straight.

393
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:09,024
This is my life...

394
00:38:09,026 --> 00:38:10,892
Sarah.
My name is Sarah.

395
00:38:10,894 --> 00:38:11,827
Great, Sarah.

396
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:14,763
Look, I'm not
fucking around right now.

397
00:38:14,765 --> 00:38:17,265
It was a fun night,
don't get me wrong,

398
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:20,035
but I don't ever wanna see you
here in my house ever again.

399
00:38:20,037 --> 00:38:22,204
You understand me?

400
00:38:22,206 --> 00:38:24,073
Sure, man.

401
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:26,178
Don't make it weird.

402
00:38:27,345 --> 00:38:29,348
All good in here?

403
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,890
What the fuck was that?

404
00:38:40,892 --> 00:38:43,291
Nothing. Nothing.

405
00:38:43,293 --> 00:38:44,292
Don't worry about it.

406
00:38:44,294 --> 00:38:47,195
Come on,
don't bullshit me, Don.

407
00:38:47,197 --> 00:38:47,930
What did you do?

408
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:49,899
I didn't do anything,
okay?

409
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:50,867
You're overreacting.

410
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:52,934
You're standing there
threatening a woman

411
00:38:52,936 --> 00:38:54,906
and I'm overreacting?

412
00:38:55,407 --> 00:38:56,972
All right.

413
00:38:56,974 --> 00:38:59,841
Look, between you and me,
I fucked up, all right?

414
00:38:59,843 --> 00:39:00,943
I didn't go looking for it.

415
00:39:00,945 --> 00:39:03,312
I didn't ask for it,
I didn't even really want it.

416
00:39:03,314 --> 00:39:05,448
It just happened,
she came back.

417
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,149
I explained to her
it was a mistake.

418
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:08,151
It's not gonna be a problem.

419
00:39:08,153 --> 00:39:09,818
Can we just go to the
hardware store for...

420
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,187
How many times
are you gonna fuck up

421
00:39:11,189 --> 00:39:13,256
until you get a clue?

422
00:39:13,258 --> 00:39:16,091
Liz is pregnant.
That's your blood.

423
00:39:16,093 --> 00:39:18,727
And you're out here trying
to recapture your glory days

424
00:39:18,729 --> 00:39:22,198
while she's busting ass
to keep a roof over your head?

425
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,999
She's my friend, dude.

426
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:26,401
What... How am I supposed
to look her in the eye now?

427
00:39:26,403 --> 00:39:28,204
Liz doesn't need
to find out, okay?

428
00:39:28,206 --> 00:39:30,707
Everything's gonna be fine.

429
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:32,274
When are you gonna start
thinking about someone

430
00:39:32,276 --> 00:39:33,209
other than yourself?

431
00:39:33,211 --> 00:39:37,113
Oh, fuck,
it is what it is, Milo, okay?

432
00:39:37,115 --> 00:39:38,881
If you can't handle it,

433
00:39:38,883 --> 00:39:41,352
don't be here
when I come back!

434
00:39:42,253 --> 00:39:44,256
Cooper!

435
00:40:44,014 --> 00:40:46,017
Of course not.

436
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:04,135
You like my trick?

437
00:41:05,068 --> 00:41:07,269
Sarah, are you crazy?
I almost fucked you up.

438
00:41:07,271 --> 00:41:09,140
I'm just playing.

439
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:14,343
Look, I'm sorry
Don's such an asshole

440
00:41:14,345 --> 00:41:16,448
but you need
to get out of here.

441
00:41:17,816 --> 00:41:19,284
Well, that's no fun.

442
00:42:14,606 --> 00:42:17,508
You wanna help me
or what?

443
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:35,993
Milo?

444
00:43:12,963 --> 00:43:16,267
All right, dick,
you can come out now.

445
00:44:24,068 --> 00:44:25,401
Oh, it's been a killer
weekend, Bun.

446
00:44:25,403 --> 00:44:27,169
We got a ton done.

447
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:28,169
<i>Did Milo have fun</i>

448
00:44:28,171 --> 00:44:28,970
<i>or did you just
work him to death?</i>

449
00:44:28,972 --> 00:44:31,173
He wanted to work
the whole time.

450
00:44:31,175 --> 00:44:32,173
Check this out.

451
00:44:32,175 --> 00:44:33,376
<i>Wow.</i>

452
00:44:33,378 --> 00:44:35,077
<i>I'm seriously impressed,
Tiger.</i>

453
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:36,548
I told you not to worry.

454
00:44:38,448 --> 00:44:39,582
<i>Wait, what was that?</i>

455
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:40,582
What?

456
00:44:40,584 --> 00:44:42,220
<i>I just saw
something behind you.</i>

457
00:44:44,255 --> 00:44:46,057
What are you
talking about?

458
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,637
<i>Don, don't mess with me,
is Milo still there?</i>

459
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:02,370
No.

460
00:45:02,372 --> 00:45:04,305
He had to head
back to work.

461
00:45:04,307 --> 00:45:05,744
Are you sure?

462
00:45:09,213 --> 00:45:10,512
<i>I don't know.</i>

463
00:45:10,514 --> 00:45:12,782
<i>I thought I saw someone.
Now I'm getting freaked out.</i>

464
00:45:12,784 --> 00:45:13,816
Well, you're not
the one who has to

465
00:45:13,818 --> 00:45:15,550
sleep here tonight,
Bunny.

466
00:45:15,552 --> 00:45:17,153
Check all this out.

467
00:45:17,155 --> 00:45:19,124
<i>Wow, it looks great,
babe.</i>

468
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:27,162
Babe, if somebody else
was in here,

469
00:45:27,164 --> 00:45:29,330
Cooper would be
all crazy right now.

470
00:45:29,332 --> 00:45:30,765
<i>Good point.</i>

471
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:32,267
You want I should
sleep with a hammer

472
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:34,070
under my pillow tonight,
just in case?

473
00:45:34,072 --> 00:45:35,437
<i>You probably better.</i>

474
00:45:35,439 --> 00:45:37,342
<i>I don't want to have to kill
someone when I get there.</i>

475
00:45:46,517 --> 00:45:47,850
<i>Are you okay?</i>

476
00:45:47,852 --> 00:45:48,718
Yeah.

477
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,285
Yeah.
I'm just getting tired, babe.

478
00:45:50,287 --> 00:45:51,454
<i>Well, rest up,
okay, babe?</i>

479
00:45:51,456 --> 00:45:53,325
<i>I'll call you tomorrow.</i>

480
00:46:06,637 --> 00:46:08,640
What the fuck?

481
00:46:52,416 --> 00:46:55,253
Ah!

482
00:46:58,722 --> 00:47:00,724
How's it going, Don?

483
00:47:05,496 --> 00:47:07,365
You wanna talk about it?

484
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:13,205
Nothing to talk about.

485
00:47:14,238 --> 00:47:16,405
Let's start with the house.

486
00:47:16,407 --> 00:47:18,376
How is she coming along?

487
00:47:18,943 --> 00:47:20,608
Just fine.

488
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,443
Fine, huh?

489
00:47:22,445 --> 00:47:25,280
You know, when a woman
gets to be a certain age,

490
00:47:25,282 --> 00:47:28,283
she doesn't like to be
futzed with too much.

491
00:47:28,285 --> 00:47:30,521
Houses aren't that different,
I guess.

492
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,562
It's...

493
00:47:39,564 --> 00:47:41,363
It's been hard.

494
00:47:41,365 --> 00:47:43,798
I bet.

495
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,436
This house is a bitch.

496
00:47:48,872 --> 00:47:50,506
What's that mean?

497
00:47:50,508 --> 00:47:54,376
Well, just that certain
places have personalities,

498
00:47:54,378 --> 00:47:56,680
and sometimes they're rotten.

499
00:47:57,981 --> 00:48:01,152
It takes a real strong hand
to turn them around again.

500
00:48:05,256 --> 00:48:06,888
I'm trying.

501
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:08,856
"Blessed is the man
who remains

502
00:48:08,858 --> 00:48:11,595
steadfast under trial."

503
00:49:26,871 --> 00:49:28,773
Hi, handsome.

504
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:43,287
Coop?

505
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,485
Cooper?

506
00:51:32,496 --> 00:51:34,631
- Sarah?
- Sarah, yeah.

507
00:51:35,633 --> 00:51:37,198
No last name?

508
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,834
I imagine she has one

509
00:51:38,836 --> 00:51:40,669
but I didn't check her ID,
okay?

510
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,702
She lives
in the neighborhood,

511
00:51:41,704 --> 00:51:43,972
she won't stop
fucking with me!

512
00:51:43,974 --> 00:51:45,110
Look.

513
00:51:49,914 --> 00:51:51,680
And?

514
00:51:51,682 --> 00:51:52,814
And?!

515
00:51:52,816 --> 00:51:53,783
You see the dog, right?

516
00:51:53,785 --> 00:51:55,550
You think he jumped
into the goddamn dryer

517
00:51:55,552 --> 00:51:56,584
by himself?

518
00:51:56,586 --> 00:51:58,053
Did he turn it on, too?

519
00:51:58,055 --> 00:52:00,457
Come on, man.
It was her.

520
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,926
Milo!

521
00:52:04,928 --> 00:52:06,562
Call me back.

522
00:52:06,564 --> 00:52:08,196
Look, I'll put the name
and the description

523
00:52:08,198 --> 00:52:09,030
in my report.

524
00:52:09,032 --> 00:52:10,899
But there's no signs
of forced entry,

525
00:52:10,901 --> 00:52:12,468
no evidence of a struggle,

526
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:13,968
and you were sleeping
upstairs the whole time

527
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,204
and didn't hear a thing.

528
00:52:15,206 --> 00:52:16,004
Oh, great.

529
00:52:16,006 --> 00:52:16,905
Well, thank you
for your service.

530
00:52:16,907 --> 00:52:19,541
Is this your idea
of law enforcement?

531
00:52:19,543 --> 00:52:21,510
You just poke your head
and you shrug your shoulders

532
00:52:21,512 --> 00:52:22,144
like a dipshit.

533
00:52:22,146 --> 00:52:24,546
You didn't do anything.

534
00:52:24,548 --> 00:52:27,519
Please let us know
if anything else comes up...

535
00:52:28,885 --> 00:52:29,920
King Don.

536
00:53:25,976 --> 00:53:28,680
<i>I hate what you've done
with the place.</i>

537
00:53:33,717 --> 00:53:35,052
I'm sorry.

538
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:39,224
For what?

539
00:53:42,325 --> 00:53:47,564
I'm sorry for not being
honest from the start.

540
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:51,135
I'm sorry for
treating you unfairly.

541
00:53:52,202 --> 00:53:55,707
I'm sorry for making
you feel unimportant.

542
00:53:56,941 --> 00:53:59,177
And most of all,
I'm sorry for threatening you.

543
00:54:01,211 --> 00:54:03,077
Wow.

544
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:04,848
Did you rehearse that?

545
00:54:07,584 --> 00:54:09,553
I deserved that,
but no.

546
00:54:14,724 --> 00:54:15,791
I mean it, I'm sorry.

547
00:54:15,793 --> 00:54:19,361
I understand why
you feel so angry.

548
00:54:19,363 --> 00:54:20,928
Well, it's not
a very nice way

549
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:23,001
to treat someone, Don.

550
00:54:24,068 --> 00:54:27,205
I hope you treat your wife
and kid better than this.

551
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:32,643
I love my wife.

552
00:54:34,945 --> 00:54:37,247
And I wish I was stronger.

553
00:54:41,285 --> 00:54:43,721
To make all this up to you,
I got you something.

554
00:54:45,356 --> 00:54:47,959
A gift from a married man.

555
00:54:49,325 --> 00:54:51,295
Sounds a lot like a bribe.

556
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:58,135
If you're interested,
it's in the kitchen.

557
00:55:07,778 --> 00:55:10,646
I appreciate the apology,
Don.

558
00:55:10,648 --> 00:55:12,617
I don't want things
to get any uglier.

559
00:57:14,771 --> 00:57:16,037
Hey, Bunny.

560
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:18,106
<i>Hey, Tiger?
What you doin'?</i>

561
00:57:18,108 --> 00:57:20,041
Oh.

562
00:57:20,043 --> 00:57:21,778
Just working.

563
00:57:23,046 --> 00:57:25,180
<i>So, I got a text
from Milo.</i>

564
00:57:25,182 --> 00:57:26,448
Oh, yeah?

565
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:28,883
<i>It was kind of weird.
He said we needed to talk.</i>

566
00:57:28,885 --> 00:57:30,050
<i>Any idea why?</i>

567
00:57:30,052 --> 00:57:31,887
No,
I have no clue, babe.

568
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:33,254
<i>Don,
just be honest with me.</i>

569
00:57:33,256 --> 00:57:34,856
<i>Look, is the renovation
in trouble?</i>

570
00:57:34,858 --> 00:57:36,193
<i>Is that what it is?</i>

571
00:57:37,293 --> 00:57:38,994
<i>Did he see some things
that he thinks</i>

572
00:57:38,996 --> 00:57:40,861
<i>I should know about?</i>

573
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,166
No!

574
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,100
<i>Tiger, calm down.</i>

575
00:57:45,102 --> 00:57:47,269
Everything is fine, Liz!
All right?

576
00:57:47,271 --> 00:57:50,070
You're gonna throw this
in my face now?!

577
00:57:50,072 --> 00:57:52,006
I have no idea why
Milo called you,

578
00:57:52,008 --> 00:57:57,111
but please, by all means,
call him, find out.

579
00:57:57,113 --> 00:58:00,784
I'm busy.
I... I wanna get back to work.

580
00:58:08,157 --> 00:58:09,893
Shit!

581
00:59:26,903 --> 00:59:28,472
Sarah!

582
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the fuck!

583
01:03:07,124 --> 01:03:08,325
Oh God!

584
01:03:30,347 --> 01:03:32,213
<i>"You've reached the voicemail

01:03:32,215 --> 01:03:33,515

Why?

590
01:05:39,575 --> 01:05:41,843
Why are you
doing this to me?

591
01:05:41,845 --> 01:05:44,582
Stay away from me!

592
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:02,497
Hello?

593
01:06:02,499 --> 01:06:04,599
Tiger?

594
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:06,769
Cooper,
come here, boy.

595
01:06:08,838 --> 01:06:10,474
Hello?

596
01:06:18,782 --> 01:06:21,552
Cooper, come here.

597
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:46,309
Absolutely not.

598
01:06:59,923 --> 01:07:02,593
Oh, Jesus, Don,
no dropcloth?

599
01:07:09,898 --> 01:07:13,036
Oh, Jesus, Don,
what did you spill here?

600
01:07:40,997 --> 01:07:44,501
What are you doing, Don?

601
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:00,984
Oh my God.

602
01:08:45,027 --> 01:08:46,863
Come on, Donald.

603
01:09:21,263 --> 01:09:23,566
What are you up to?

604
01:09:37,045 --> 01:09:38,913
Jesus!

605
01:09:38,915 --> 01:09:40,517
I'm so, so, so sorry.

606
01:09:43,286 --> 01:09:45,019
Uh, I'm sorry,
can I help you?

607
01:09:45,021 --> 01:09:46,119
I didn't mean
to frighten you.

608
01:09:46,121 --> 01:09:47,654
My name is Sarah.

609
01:09:47,656 --> 01:09:48,991
I've been helping Don.

610
01:09:50,593 --> 01:09:52,092
Uh, hel... helping Don?

611
01:09:52,094 --> 01:09:54,595
I'm sorry, what does,
what does that mean exactly?

612
01:09:54,597 --> 01:09:56,867
You know, getting the house
ready for you.

613
01:09:57,767 --> 01:10:00,668
Because you're a carpenter?

614
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:03,837
No, ma'am.
More like a gofer.

615
01:10:03,839 --> 01:10:06,606
"Drywall screws, boss?
Sure thing!"

616
01:10:06,608 --> 01:10:08,809
I'm an architecture nut.
Don couldn't say no.

617
01:10:08,811 --> 01:10:11,482
No. That definitely
isn't his strong suit.

618
01:10:13,049 --> 01:10:14,782
How long?

619
01:10:14,784 --> 01:10:15,983
I'm sorry?

620
01:10:15,985 --> 01:10:17,017
Your baby?

621
01:10:17,019 --> 01:10:19,055
How long till she's due?

622
01:10:19,789 --> 01:10:21,154
Uh, twelve weeks.

623
01:10:21,156 --> 01:10:23,791
If she's anything like me,
she'll be on time.

624
01:10:23,793 --> 01:10:25,696
If she's like her father,
much later.

625
01:10:26,295 --> 01:10:27,127
May I?

626
01:10:27,129 --> 01:10:28,731
Oh, I don't think so.

627
01:10:30,133 --> 01:10:31,602
Someone's here.

628
01:10:43,646 --> 01:10:44,779
Missus Koch?

629
01:10:44,781 --> 01:10:45,346
Yes?

630
01:10:45,348 --> 01:10:47,582
I'm Ellie Mueller.

631
01:10:47,584 --> 01:10:48,649
Can we talk?

632
01:10:48,651 --> 01:10:50,918
Let me guess,
you're the plumber?

633
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,921
Uh, no, darling,
I work across the street.

634
01:10:53,923 --> 01:10:55,826
But I do deal with
a lot of people's shit.

635
01:10:57,293 --> 01:10:59,327
That's right,
Don did mention you, sorry.

636
01:10:59,329 --> 01:11:01,796
Would, would you
like to come in?

637
01:11:01,798 --> 01:11:03,965
Why don't we chat
outside instead?

638
01:11:03,967 --> 01:11:06,836
Okay. Sure, just, uh,
give me a sec, okay?

639
01:11:10,173 --> 01:11:12,675
Hey, sorry to be rude
but, um...

640
01:11:13,142 --> 01:11:14,811
Hello?

641
01:11:17,045 --> 01:11:18,846
So how's Don doing?

642
01:11:18,848 --> 01:11:22,283
He looks tired,
but he's a workhorse.

643
01:11:22,285 --> 01:11:24,385
Where... where is he now?

644
01:11:24,387 --> 01:11:25,319
I'm not really sure.

645
01:11:25,321 --> 01:11:27,887
He must have just
taken the dog for a run.

646
01:11:27,889 --> 01:11:31,794
I, I should have called first,
but I wanted to surprise him.

647
01:11:33,228 --> 01:11:35,261
Would you say
it's a good marriage?

648
01:11:35,263 --> 01:11:38,164
I'm sorry?

649
01:11:38,166 --> 01:11:39,166
Ah.

650
01:11:39,168 --> 01:11:40,368
This house has a history

651
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:42,802
of bringing out
the worst in people.

652
01:11:42,804 --> 01:11:46,774
I just wanted make sure
you two are prepared for that.

653
01:11:46,776 --> 01:11:47,708
Right.

654
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:49,176
Well, it, it clearly
needs a lot of work,

655
01:11:49,178 --> 01:11:51,044
but it's...
it's not that bad.

656
01:11:51,046 --> 01:11:52,779
I'm sure we'll manage.

657
01:11:52,781 --> 01:11:54,114
You never really know
until you start

658
01:11:54,116 --> 01:11:56,150
tearing a place up,
though.

659
01:11:56,152 --> 01:11:57,885
Uh-hmm.

660
01:11:57,887 --> 01:12:00,154
Well, thank you for your
concern, really, uh,

661
01:12:00,156 --> 01:12:02,288
but Don and I have been
through much worse,

662
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:04,628
so we'll be fine.

663
01:12:34,456 --> 01:12:37,227
I am not creeped out
by this house one bit.

664
01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:41,965
I am in complete control
of my emotions.

665
01:12:43,098 --> 01:12:44,934
Just like Beyonce.

666
01:12:55,344 --> 01:12:57,714
Oh, Christ.

667
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

668
01:13:33,215 --> 01:13:35,419
Fuck this.

669
01:14:07,482 --> 01:14:09,182
Hi.

670
01:14:09,184 --> 01:14:10,720
I'm worried.

671
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:23,500
My husband is a fuck-up.

672
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,333
Well, you're not the first
woman to say that

673
01:14:26,335 --> 01:14:27,935
about her husband.

674
01:14:27,937 --> 01:14:29,171
No.

675
01:14:30,205 --> 01:14:33,342
I don't mean he, uh,
leaves the toilet seat up.

676
01:14:36,278 --> 01:14:38,247
He, um...

677
01:14:40,215 --> 01:14:42,382
he defrauded his clients

678
01:14:42,384 --> 01:14:45,151
out of their
retirement funds.

679
01:14:45,153 --> 01:14:49,123
He barely avoided fifteen years
in a federal prison.

680
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:50,990
He cheated on me

681
01:14:50,992 --> 01:14:53,894
while I was trying
to get pregnant,

682
01:14:53,896 --> 01:14:57,064
and then he insists
that buying this house

683
01:14:57,066 --> 01:14:59,936
was our second chance,
so, yeah.

684
01:15:00,836 --> 01:15:02,272
So why'd you stay?

685
01:15:05,907 --> 01:15:08,441
The alternatives
seemed worse.

686
01:15:08,443 --> 01:15:11,311
Life is a series
of choices.

687
01:15:11,313 --> 01:15:13,614
Cause and effect.

688
01:15:13,616 --> 01:15:16,617
Sounds like Don hasn't
learned that dynamic yet.

689
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:18,485
I'm just scared.

690
01:15:18,487 --> 01:15:20,053
Oh, I'm scared
he's drinking again.

691
01:15:20,055 --> 01:15:22,125
He's probably drunk
right now.

692
01:15:23,425 --> 01:15:27,026
I think this house just
pushed him right over the edge.

693
01:15:27,028 --> 01:15:29,999
This house has a habit
of testing men.

694
01:15:30,532 --> 01:15:31,865
I've met families
who have lived there

695
01:15:31,867 --> 01:15:34,635
happily for years
and others

696
01:15:34,637 --> 01:15:37,171
who never make it a home.

697
01:15:37,173 --> 01:15:40,173
The difference seems to
come down to the character

698
01:15:40,175 --> 01:15:43,077
and determination
of the people moving in.

699
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:45,115
Well, we're screwed, then.

700
01:15:46,648 --> 01:15:48,184
So what's the plan?

701
01:15:49,117 --> 01:15:51,017
I don't know.
Wait for him to come home,

702
01:15:51,019 --> 01:15:52,388
sober up.

703
01:15:53,555 --> 01:15:56,927
And then have a long,
honest talk about our future.

704
01:15:57,994 --> 01:16:00,197
You're a brave woman, Liz.

705
01:16:01,129 --> 01:16:03,263
You want my advice?

706
01:16:03,265 --> 01:16:04,465
Get your husband
and your baby

707
01:16:04,467 --> 01:16:06,836
far away from that house.

708
01:16:48,009 --> 01:16:49,512
Uh, excuse me?

709
01:16:52,013 --> 01:16:53,315
Don?

710
01:16:56,419 --> 01:16:58,252
Don?

711
01:16:58,254 --> 01:16:59,990
Jesus.

712
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,159
Welcome home.

713
01:17:05,161 --> 01:17:06,961
What the fuck
is going on here?

714
01:17:06,963 --> 01:17:08,162
A party.

715
01:17:08,164 --> 01:17:10,631
Where is my husband?

716
01:17:10,633 --> 01:17:12,466
Upstairs, I think.

717
01:17:12,468 --> 01:17:14,400
Cocktail?

718
01:17:14,402 --> 01:17:16,138
Fuck off.

719
01:17:17,473 --> 01:17:18,675
Don?

720
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:25,282
Don!

721
01:17:35,223 --> 01:17:36,625
Don!

722
01:17:42,464 --> 01:17:44,166
Joining?

723
01:17:45,433 --> 01:17:47,070
No.

724
01:17:48,304 --> 01:17:49,569
Don?

725
01:17:49,571 --> 01:17:51,105
The show's already started.

726
01:17:51,107 --> 01:17:52,709
Go upstairs.

727
01:19:15,357 --> 01:19:17,093
Don?!

728
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,030
Don!

729
01:19:58,134 --> 01:19:59,702
Oh.

730
01:20:21,656 --> 01:20:23,157
Stop!

731
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:24,561
Stop!

732
01:20:41,242 --> 01:20:42,879
Is the show over already?

733
01:20:59,661 --> 01:21:01,763
That's my girl.

734
01:21:39,802 --> 01:21:41,568
The male performers
wore costumes

735
01:21:41,570 --> 01:21:43,369
because the owner
felt the mix of erotic

736
01:21:43,371 --> 01:21:45,674
and grotesque heightened
the experience.

737
01:21:46,407 --> 01:21:47,873
He was right.

738
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:50,245
We were popular,
and the money flowed in.

739
01:21:50,745 --> 01:21:52,945
Some nights,
we'd work until dawn.

740
01:21:52,947 --> 01:21:55,649
It was too busy
to keep an eye on everyone.

741
01:21:55,651 --> 01:21:57,320
Even the innocent ones.

742
01:21:57,987 --> 01:22:00,290
Even the not-so-innocent.

743
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:05,859
He played with her for months
and then killed her,

744
01:22:05,861 --> 01:22:07,627
dumping her body
at the train tracks,

745
01:22:07,629 --> 01:22:09,395
and the world moved on.

746
01:22:09,397 --> 01:22:12,735
Well, some of the world did.

747
01:22:14,737 --> 01:22:17,971
When he killed me,
my body never left the house.

748
01:22:17,973 --> 01:22:19,840
I was a star,

749
01:22:19,842 --> 01:22:23,010
loved by the men who
came through our doors,

750
01:22:23,012 --> 01:22:25,948
but not one of them
questioned my disappearance.

751
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:31,454
All men really love
is the power you give them.

752
01:23:15,563 --> 01:23:17,432
Don.

753
01:23:18,866 --> 01:23:21,670
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

754
01:23:26,407 --> 01:23:28,510
I'm so sorry.

755
01:23:30,446 --> 01:23:32,381
I couldn't get them all.

756
01:23:33,715 --> 01:23:36,048
Don, baby?

757
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:38,553
What happened to you?
What happened?

758
01:23:39,888 --> 01:23:41,020
Hey, look, look.

759
01:23:41,022 --> 01:23:42,855
I don't know what the fuck
is going on in this house,

760
01:23:42,857 --> 01:23:45,592
but we got to get
out of here right now.

761
01:23:45,594 --> 01:23:47,430
It's not that easy.

762
01:23:48,563 --> 01:23:50,465
What does that mean?

763
01:23:51,532 --> 01:23:52,966
Bunny, I fucked up again.

764
01:23:52,968 --> 01:23:55,435
What does that mean,
Don?

765
01:23:55,437 --> 01:23:58,538
I just...
I felt so small.

766
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:00,977
I just wanted to be
the man one more time.

767
01:24:02,643 --> 01:24:04,744
You understand that
don't you, Bunny?

768
01:24:04,746 --> 01:24:07,480
No!

769
01:24:07,482 --> 01:24:09,449
I don't!

770
01:24:09,451 --> 01:24:10,717
Bunny!

771
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:12,052
I promise I can change.

772
01:24:12,054 --> 01:24:14,788
I promise it'll be different.
Bunny, look at me.

773
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:18,758
Bunny, you just have to say
that you understand

774
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:19,860
and that it's okay.

775
01:24:19,862 --> 01:24:21,595
Please.

776
01:24:21,597 --> 01:24:25,034
It's not okay!

777
01:24:29,437 --> 01:24:31,106
I can change, Liz!

778
01:24:56,432 --> 01:24:57,565
I'm proud of you, Liz!

779
01:24:57,567 --> 01:24:59,969
Thought you weren't gonna
make it there at the end.

780
01:25:15,517 --> 01:25:17,450
<i>Hey, Liz.</i>

781
01:25:17,452 --> 01:25:18,987
<i>Liz!</i>

782
01:25:59,061 --> 01:26:00,530
Nope!

783
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:06,028
<i>You did good.</i>

784
01:27:07,896 --> 01:27:08,694
I'd offer you some,

785
01:27:08,696 --> 01:27:10,696
but it isn't the
seventies anymore.

786
01:27:10,698 --> 01:27:13,233
You knew?

787
01:27:13,235 --> 01:27:15,101
Yeah,

788
01:27:15,103 --> 01:27:17,837
I watch this house
and it watches mine.

789
01:27:17,839 --> 01:27:20,640
Why the fuck
didn't you warn us?

790
01:27:20,642 --> 01:27:23,275
Life is a series
of choices, Liz.

791
01:27:23,277 --> 01:27:25,311
You can't talk someone
into doing the right thing

792
01:27:25,313 --> 01:27:27,146
or the wrong thing.

793
01:27:27,148 --> 01:27:28,882
I couldn't keep someone
out of this house

794
01:27:28,884 --> 01:27:31,117
any more than
those girls inside

795
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:33,252
could keep someone
out of mine.

796
01:27:33,254 --> 01:27:36,791
Need to lay the options out
and see what they choose.

797
01:27:37,358 --> 01:27:39,528
A test.

798
01:27:40,128 --> 01:27:41,764
Exactly.

799
01:27:42,863 --> 01:27:45,268
Well, it seems like
a pretty shitty game.

800
01:27:46,668 --> 01:27:47,969
It is, kiddo.

801
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:50,973
But I didn't make the rules.

802
01:29:21,463 --> 01:29:23,832
Hello, my little angel.

803
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:27,303
You don't wanna
sleep at all, do you?

804
01:29:28,737 --> 01:29:31,007
After your nap,
we're gonna go to the park.

805
01:29:32,073 --> 01:29:33,075
Would you like that, huh?

806
01:29:39,246 --> 01:29:40,915
I love you so much.
