00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:10,399
Find me

3
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:50,169
closer

4
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:43,276
Found you

5
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:47,710
Ah ha!

6
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:49,273
You think you could hide
from me, did you?

7
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:52,096
Did you read what it said?
It said found you.

8
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,410
- It didn't say tickle...
- Samuel. Bee.

9
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,076
That's enough.

10
00:03:59,944 --> 00:04:02,993
- You don't want to get overheated.
- I'm not.

11
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:04,435
You're sure?

12
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,623
Good.
Because now it's my turn!

13
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Dad, help!
- You need help?
Oh sure, I can
help tickle you.
I think the bottom of this feet
might be very ticklish.

14
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:29,849
Time for bed, Bee.

15
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:34,430
Thank you.

16
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:44,477
- I love you Mommy.
- I love you more.

17
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:51,360
Mommy?

18
00:04:57,805 --> 00:05:00,745
- Just for a little while.
- Thanks.

19
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,436
- Mommy.
- Um-hm.

20
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:33,740
Can we play dollies
when we get home?

21
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:36,906
Well, I think if you help me
with the washing up

22
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:40,311
- I can play dollies with you all afternoon.
- Sam.

23
00:05:40,336 --> 00:05:41,219
Yes!

24
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:42,376
Sam.

25
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:44,322
Good morning, Sam.

26
00:05:44,347 --> 00:05:45,701
- Good morning, Esther.
- Morning.

27
00:05:45,726 --> 00:05:47,585
Hey there, busy Bee.

28
00:05:48,077 --> 00:05:49,647
Sam, just wondering...

29
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:51,425
if you got that order
of mine ready yet?

30
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,855
I got customers coming
into my store everyday

31
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,568
asking about your dolls.

32
00:05:55,593 --> 00:05:57,985
You can send your son
over tomorrow, Vic.

33
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,151
They're ready.

34
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:00,187
Well, hallelujah.

35
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:02,541
I guess prayers do
get answered, don't they?

36
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:03,538
They do.

37
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,028
Oh right... well, thank you so much.
You all have a good Sunday.

38
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:08,297
- You have a good day too.
- You have a lovely day.

39
00:06:10,346 --> 00:06:11,736
In you get.

40
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:16,258
Damn it!

41
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,223
Language.

42
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:24,461
There's a car coming,
why don't I wave it down

43
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:25,890
and see if we can
get some help.

44
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:27,777
No, no, no, no.
I got it.

45
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'll get it.

46
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,658

52
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:34,393
Okay.
Pick a number.

53
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:36,748
Linda?

54
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:39,139
Um.

55
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,198
Four.

56
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:42,773
Okay.

57
00:07:43,644 --> 00:07:46,143
You'll soon make new friends.

58
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:48,885
Do my now.

59
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:53,401
What's wrong?

60
00:07:54,784 --> 00:07:57,143
I just wish you and me
were going to a new home

61
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:59,317
instead of a new orphanage.

62
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,128
Sweet Sue thinks too.

63
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,193
It would be nice
to have a home.

64
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,853
Yeah, but...
only if you're there.

65
00:08:10,878 --> 00:08:13,382
I don't want to go
anywhere you're not.

66
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:16,919
So, let's swear.

67
00:08:16,944 --> 00:08:20,307
If someone wants one of us,
they get both of us.

68
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:23,389
Okay.
I swear.

69
00:08:23,414 --> 00:08:24,739
Good.

70
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:26,583
Me too.

71
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:30,103
You know what I like most
about Sweet Sue?

72
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:31,722
What?

73
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:35,470
She looks just like you.

74
00:08:38,305 --> 00:08:40,647
So, how much further
is it, father?

75
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:44,725
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
You're worse than the children, sister.

76
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:49,876
The Mullins agreeing to take
us in was a gift from god.

77
00:08:49,901 --> 00:08:53,224
What kind of person isn't
excited about getting a gift?

78
00:08:53,523 --> 00:08:55,776
I should mention
don't be alarm if you...

79
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,465
don't see much of
Mrs Mullins at first.

80
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,973
She... has a condition.

81
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:05,426
You see, she was in
an accident years ago.

82
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:08,556
You girls would do well
to help her if need be.

83
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:22,569
Janice.
You need help?

84
00:10:22,594 --> 00:10:25,111
No, thanks.
I can manage.

85
00:10:30,648 --> 00:10:32,075
Sister.

86
00:10:33,402 --> 00:10:36,724
She's one of the unfortunate ones
with that polio outbreak,

87
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:39,521
but she's getting stronger everyday.

88
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:42,302
She won't be a burden,
I promise you.

89
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:43,495
Um-hm.

90
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:47,150
Mr Mullins, why don't
you show the girls around?

91
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:49,907
I can unload their belongings.

92
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:52,347
We'll start inside.

93
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:54,329
Thank you, father.

94
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:06,136
Wow.
This is an amazing castle.

95
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:08,863
Which obviously makes us the princesses.

96
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:10,297
This is our new orphanage?

97
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:13,016
Which is fine if
we're never being adopted.

98
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:17,002
There's a TV.

99
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:21,297
The television no longer works,
the radio however does.

100
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:29,223
This goes on forever.

101
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:32,125
You're right. We're going to need
a map to find our way around.

102
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,355
Girls, this way.

103
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:38,515
As you can see, the dining room
is more than adequate

104
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,703
to accommodate all of us.

105
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:44,526
Wow.
What's in here?

106
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,365
Let's stay together.

107
00:11:53,762 --> 00:11:56,330
Mrs Mullins and I stay in here.

108
00:11:56,654 --> 00:12:00,255
Fell free to use the rest of the
downstairs as you see fit.

109
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,489
Your rooms are upstairs.

110
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:04,077
Mr Mullins.

111
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:08,047
Is there someway Janice and I
can maybe stay down here?

112
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,722
Me too.

113
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:11,456
I'll be fine.

114
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,543
I installed it years ago
for my wife.

115
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:32,570
Hasn't been used in ages,
it works fine.

116
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:34,756
Try it, Jan.

117
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:38,669
If you don't, I will.

118
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:45,174
Up is up

119
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,917
Down is down.

120
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:48,822
It won't work...

121
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:53,169
... unless you click the seat belt in.

122
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:55,370
Like this.

123
00:12:57,423 --> 00:12:58,904
Simple.

124
00:13:10,086 --> 00:13:11,600
Thank you.

125
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,279
I get to go next!

126
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:26,976
Wow.
Nice.

127
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:29,573
I guess this is ours.

128
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,979
Let's take that side.

129
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:36,204
Kate and Tierney can have these.

130
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:38,505
What about Linda and me?

131
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:42,669
Relax, Janice. This is a big house,
there are other bedrooms.

132
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:44,679
Why can't Linda and me
have those over there?

133
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:48,329
Okay, but then,
where would Kate and Tierney sleep?

134
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:56,594
Wow.

135
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,258
This is neat.

136
00:14:58,283 --> 00:14:59,718
I got this one.

137
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:28,129
Locked.

138
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:30,702
And it stays that way too.

139
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:42,256
Hey, Jan.
In here.

140
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

141
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,475
Hey.

142
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:14,867
You wanna bunk beds?

143
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:34,541
- Hey sister Charlotte, can we...
- Oh lord.

144
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:39,040
Please bless Nancy with the wisdom
to not give people their heart attacks.

145
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:40,330
Sorry.

146
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:41,781
What is your emergency?

147
00:17:41,806 --> 00:17:43,066
Can we go exploring?

148
00:17:43,091 --> 00:17:45,078
Help father Massey with
your things first and then...

149
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:46,686
But Mr Mullins insist that we go.

150
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- But that doesn't mean you don't have to...
- You know how father Massey is.
We'll only get in the way.
- Fine.
- She said okay!

151
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:57,256
But look out for one another.

152
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:03,536
You coming, Jan?

153
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,595
Maybe in a little while.

154
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:08,727
Well.

155
00:18:09,516 --> 00:18:11,275
Maybe I'll stay too.

156
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:13,769
Because you feel sorry for me?

157
00:18:14,672 --> 00:18:15,832
Well...

158
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:19,045
You promised you wouldn't
treat me any differently.

159
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,563
Okay.

160
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,980
See ya!

161
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:06,662
Dear lord.
Thank you for bringing us all together.

162
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:10,301
Bless this food for our use,

163
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,035
and us to thy service.

164
00:20:14,104 --> 00:20:17,061
Fill our hearts with grateful praise.

165
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:21,299
And help us give you
glory each day through

166
00:20:23,226 --> 00:20:25,988
Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.

167
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:27,313
Amen.

168
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:40,656
If you'd excuse me.

169
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:17,004
Carol.

170
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:25,353
Keep to your own business.

171
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:42,303
And if I die before I wake,
I pray the lord my soul to take.

172
00:21:42,328 --> 00:21:44,584
Please, god.
Help Linda and me find a good home

173
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,028
and keeps us together.

174
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:49,802
- So we finally be real sisters.
- With good loving parents.

175
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:52,395
That hate homework
as much as we do.

176
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,580
But, even if they don't,
that's okay too.

177
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,696
Amen.

178
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,944
Find me

179
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:27,541
in here

180
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:38,621
Nancy.

181
00:23:39,745 --> 00:23:41,113
Carol.

00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,973
Are you guys in here?

183
00:23:48,077 --> 00:23:52,656
Forgive me, Father,
for I am about to sin.

184
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:36,433
I bet this is where
Mr Mullins keeps his wife.

185
00:30:36,831 --> 00:30:38,482
Does she really wear a mask?

186
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:40,745
Yeah, she look like a doll.

187
00:30:41,976 --> 00:30:43,799
Mrs Mullins?

188
00:30:43,983 --> 00:30:45,331
You down there?

189
00:30:45,356 --> 00:30:46,581
Stop it.

190
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,323
I think he seems nice.

191
00:30:49,578 --> 00:30:52,426
Why don't you go find Janice,
see what she's up to.

192
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:53,545
Why?

193
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,392
So you can talk about boys.

194
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:57,986
Well, do you want to
talk about boys?

195
00:30:58,198 --> 00:31:00,889
Gross.
No.

196
00:31:01,046 --> 00:31:02,398
I wanna play a game.

197
00:31:02,423 --> 00:31:03,751
Okay.

198
00:31:03,776 --> 00:31:05,260
Let's play hide and seek.

199
00:31:05,285 --> 00:31:07,660
You go hide and
we'll come look for you.

200
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:09,026
Okay.

201
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:17,228
So, are we going to
look for her?

202
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:18,990
Maybe.

203
00:31:24,998 --> 00:31:26,561
Bless you.

204
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:27,923
Thank you.

205
00:31:28,674 --> 00:31:30,120
What are you doing?

206
00:31:30,145 --> 00:31:33,445
I asked Mr Mullins if we could use
this room for our new classroom

207
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,779
and he graciously agreed.

208
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:37,643
Would you like to help?

209
00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:41,390
What's wrong?

210
00:31:42,782 --> 00:31:45,118
I have a sin to confess.

211
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:49,644
Forgive me, sister Charlotte,
for I have sinned.

212
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:53,362
-  It's been...
- At least 2 weeks.

213
00:31:54,451 --> 00:31:56,934
... at least 2 weeks
since my last confession.

214
00:31:59,173 --> 00:32:01,565
There's this room upstairs
I'm not suppose to go into.

215
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,305
But you did anyway.

216
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,495
How did you know?

217
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,873
Because otherwise why would
you be telling me about it.

218
00:32:10,604 --> 00:32:13,315
Well, the door was already opened.

219
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:17,582
I don't know how because
Mr Mullins always keeps it locked.

220
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:20,467
When I went inside
there was this little doll.

221
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:22,697
- And it was really strange.
- Janice.

222
00:32:22,938 --> 00:32:24,544
Weird things started to happen.

223
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:27,052
Janice, listen to yourself.

224
00:32:28,327 --> 00:32:30,687
What do I always say?

225
00:32:31,585 --> 00:32:34,891
A sin is a sin
no matter the context.

226
00:32:36,017 --> 00:32:40,437
More importantly, you absolutely
cannot disobey the Mullins.

227
00:32:41,848 --> 00:32:44,760
We only just got here and
they're doing a very generous thing

228
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:47,195
by allowing us
to stay with them.

229
00:32:48,743 --> 00:32:51,579
If they decide to
no longer have us here

230
00:32:51,604 --> 00:32:53,445
we'll all be split up.

231
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:57,167
So next time you're thinking
of breaking a rule,

232
00:32:57,503 --> 00:33:01,874
think of how that could've affect
the other girls first.

233
00:33:03,971 --> 00:33:05,234
Do you understand me?

234
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:07,188
Yes.
I'm sorry, sister, I wasn't thinking.

235
00:33:07,213 --> 00:33:08,699
It's okay, love.

236
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:14,182
For your penance,
pray 1 Hail Mary

237
00:33:14,363 --> 00:33:17,575
and unpack 3 of these boxes.

238
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:24,133
What are you guys doing?

239
00:33:25,096 --> 00:33:26,981
Unpacking boxes.

240
00:33:27,345 --> 00:33:28,533
Oh.

241
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:17,788
This place is so creepy.

242
00:34:31,556 --> 00:34:32,969
What was that?

243
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:40,018
What was that?

244
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:48,219
How dare you!

245
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:53,847
Oh, Mr Scarecrow.

246
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,895
Oh.

247
00:36:06,889 --> 00:36:08,346
Found you.

248
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:11,087
You're not very good at hiding.

249
00:36:16,527 --> 00:36:19,759
Years of neglect have
affected the counter balance.

250
00:36:20,093 --> 00:36:22,680
There.
That should keep the draft out.

251
00:36:22,705 --> 00:36:24,155
Thank you.

252
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

253
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:35,079
Those taken in Romania.

254
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:37,397
At a convent of cloistered nuns.

255
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:39,206
They have little contact
with the outside world

256
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:42,079
but I became very close
to these three.

257
00:36:42,104 --> 00:36:45,351
That's sister Maria.
That's sister Anna.

258
00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:47,409
And that's sister Lucia.

259
00:36:48,922 --> 00:36:50,603
Who's this?

260
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:52,125
!! Valak !!

261
00:36:53,372 --> 00:36:56,297
I... don't know.
I don't think I even met her.

262
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:01,159
Is there anything else you need?

263
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:02,803
No.
Thank you.

264
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,244
Good night.

265
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:12,126
Good night.

266
00:37:15,327 --> 00:37:17,125
Uuu.
I like him.

267
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:19,135
Which one would you marry?

268
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,827
Oh.
I don't know.

269
00:37:20,852 --> 00:37:23,861
I guess I'll just have to date
all of them to find out.

270
00:37:24,646 --> 00:37:26,056
This is Ira.

271
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:28,910
- His eye.
- He's very handsome.

272
00:37:53,831 --> 00:37:57,393
Night time is when Mrs Mullins
gets her powers.

273
00:37:57,418 --> 00:37:59,980
That's why she's in bed all day.
But at night...

274
00:38:00,005 --> 00:38:01,976
she can go wherever she wants.

275
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:05,584
She needs to
so she can feed.

276
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:08,342
And if you look directly
at her you'll die.

277
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:10,484
And to get you to look,
she'll keep saying your name

278
00:38:10,509 --> 00:38:15,259
over and over
till you can't stand it!

279
00:38:17,418 --> 00:38:20,621
Nancy.
Nancy.

280
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:23,010
- Nancy...
- No. No.

281
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:24,288
Nancy.

282
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,716
Oh.

283
00:38:43,341 --> 00:38:45,159
She's ready to feed.

284
00:38:45,798 --> 00:38:48,643
Carol.
Carol.

285
00:38:48,668 --> 00:38:49,694
Carol.

286
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,060
Hey, we're not suppose to be up.

287
00:38:51,085 --> 00:38:53,352
- Well, you'll do it to.
- Hey.

288
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,644
Why isn't he answering her?

289
00:39:35,538 --> 00:39:37,421
- It's her.
- Don't look at her.

290
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:38,644
No!

291
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:41,964
Please please please...

292
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:43,566
Please.

293
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,688
Please.

294
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,457
She's gone.

295
00:39:57,779 --> 00:39:59,195
She's gone.

296
00:40:02,953 --> 00:40:04,529
What's going on?

297
00:40:04,554 --> 00:40:05,804
What on god's earth?

298
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:07,277
- Sister Charlotte.
- Mrs Mullins.

299
00:40:07,302 --> 00:40:08,360
She was here.
We heard.

300
00:40:08,385 --> 00:40:10,686
In this room,
she was sitting right over there.

301
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:11,949
Who?

302
00:40:12,998 --> 00:40:14,693
Your wife apparently.

303
00:40:14,718 --> 00:40:16,439
They said she was
just in here.

304
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:18,073
Oh, that's impossible.

305
00:40:18,098 --> 00:40:21,215
My wife hasn't been
able to walk for years.

306
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

307
00:40:44,271 --> 00:40:46,594
Girls.
Girls.

308
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,359
Let's go back to our studies, okay?

309
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,407
You okay, Nance?

310
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,198
Did you really see Mrs Mullins
in your room last night?

311
00:41:19,223 --> 00:41:21,046
Yes.
We swear we were under the cover and...

312
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:23,087
Nancy.
Stop it.

313
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:26,161
We just freaked ourselves out
last night, you know that.

314
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:43,948
Mrs Mullins?

315
00:41:44,517 --> 00:41:46,383
Sister Charlotte.

316
00:41:46,494 --> 00:41:49,579
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

317
00:41:49,604 --> 00:41:51,174
Of course.

318
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:29,029
It's good to hear
some life again.

319
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:34,500
I've been cooped up here so long
I forgotten what that sounded like.

320
00:42:36,424 --> 00:42:38,397
What a lovely picture.

321
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,442
She was taken from us

322
00:42:40,467 --> 00:42:43,509
at an early age... unfortunately.

323
00:42:45,198 --> 00:42:47,889
If you could turn away
for a moment, sister.

324
00:42:47,914 --> 00:42:49,360
Yes, of course.

325
00:42:51,346 --> 00:42:54,520
I'm very sorry to hear
about your daughter.

326
00:42:56,747 --> 00:43:00,985
But we find comfort in knowing
she waits for you in heaven.

327
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:03,772
I wish that were true.

328
00:44:55,757 --> 00:44:58,034
Oh my gosh.

329
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:01,402
You shouldn't be in here.

330
00:45:01,544 --> 00:45:03,533
Well, neither should you.

331
00:45:14,642 --> 00:45:16,712
Who's room is this anyways?

332
00:45:16,737 --> 00:45:18,652
The Mullins had a daughter.

333
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:20,332
It was her's.

334
00:45:22,614 --> 00:45:24,176
Had one?

335
00:45:24,797 --> 00:45:26,741
I think she died.

336
00:45:29,224 --> 00:45:32,032
And I think that was her
playing the music too.

337
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,209
Stop trying to scare me.

338
00:45:39,234 --> 00:45:41,124
I'm not.
It's the truth.

339
00:45:41,149 --> 00:45:43,084
Then why are we in here.

340
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:45,043
- We should leave.
- No.

341
00:45:45,773 --> 00:45:46,873
Oh.

342
00:45:58,749 --> 00:46:00,112
Linda.

343
00:46:00,556 --> 00:46:01,943
What is it?

344
00:46:03,515 --> 00:46:05,512
We shouldn't be in here.

345
00:46:07,462 --> 00:46:08,746
Okay.

346
00:46:09,971 --> 00:46:11,719
I'll leave in a minute.

347
00:46:11,744 --> 00:46:13,301
Well, I'm going.

348
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,835
Dear Diary, today I came home

349
00:47:22,347 --> 00:47:23,765
Who's doing that?

350
00:48:14,953 --> 00:48:16,251
Hi.

351
00:48:30,276 --> 00:48:33,463
You're the Mullins' daughter...
aren't you?

352
00:48:35,977 --> 00:48:38,150
What happened to you?

353
00:48:38,446 --> 00:48:40,340
Will you help me?

354
00:48:43,293 --> 00:48:45,071
What do you need?

355
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:50,895
YOUR SOUL!

356
00:49:11,742 --> 00:49:13,461
Charlotte!

357
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Sister Charlotte!

358
00:50:26,881 --> 00:50:28,089
No.

359
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

360
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

361
00:52:30,165 --> 00:52:31,905
How do you feel?

362
00:52:33,054 --> 00:52:34,768
Give her some space.

363
00:52:39,054 --> 00:52:40,471
Girls.

364
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:43,302
Janice is feeling
a little down right now.

365
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:46,220
So, we need to do
what we can to support her.

366
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:49,428
Time I think
is all she needs.

367
00:52:49,811 --> 00:52:52,852
She'll walk again, right?

368
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,471
We'll have to see.

369
00:52:57,281 --> 00:52:58,613
You need sleep.

370
00:52:58,638 --> 00:53:01,202
That's going to help you
with the healing.

371
00:53:01,601 --> 00:53:04,087
I can't stay here, sister Charlotte.

372
00:53:04,964 --> 00:53:06,783
We can't stay here.

373
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,474
We need to leave.

374
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:09,924
Leave.

375
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,657
And go where?

376
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,087
There isn't anywhere else
for us to go.

377
00:53:17,872 --> 00:53:20,710
I didn't fall down those stairs.

378
00:53:21,447 --> 00:53:23,426
Something threw me.

379
00:53:23,961 --> 00:53:25,737
What do you mean?

380
00:53:28,329 --> 00:53:30,159
You always say that

381
00:53:30,366 --> 00:53:33,243
even though we can't see god
we can...

382
00:53:33,268 --> 00:53:35,514
we can feel his presence.

383
00:53:36,177 --> 00:53:37,534
Well...

384
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:41,929
in this house I feel
a different kind of presence.

385
00:53:42,134 --> 00:53:43,683
What kind?

386
00:53:47,822 --> 00:53:49,774
An evil one.

387
00:53:49,908 --> 00:53:51,897
It's coming after me.

388
00:53:51,922 --> 00:53:53,340
Coming after my soul.

389
00:53:53,365 --> 00:53:54,877
You soul.

390
00:53:54,902 --> 00:53:56,978
Because I'm the weakest.

391
00:53:57,003 --> 00:53:58,728
No, darling.

392
00:53:59,045 --> 00:54:00,342
Listen.

393
00:54:00,521 --> 00:54:03,236
The devil preys on
those weak in faith,

394
00:54:03,261 --> 00:54:05,684
not weak of flesh and bone.

395
00:54:05,939 --> 00:54:09,525
You are as strong
as any of us, Janice.

396
00:54:10,835 --> 00:54:12,413
Stronger.

397
00:54:29,096 --> 00:54:31,440
You're quiet, Samuel.

398
00:54:32,504 --> 00:54:34,725
I think it was a mistake...

399
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,550
to bring the girls here.

400
00:54:38,726 --> 00:54:40,203
Why?

401
00:54:42,521 --> 00:54:44,208
The girl ...

402
00:54:44,632 --> 00:54:46,307
The girl who fell.

403
00:54:47,674 --> 00:54:49,642
Maybe she didn't fall.

404
00:54:50,275 --> 00:54:51,808
Maybe...

405
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:54,394
It was an accident.

406
00:54:55,193 --> 00:54:56,961
That's all it was.

407
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,268
Accidents happen.

408
00:55:03,563 --> 00:55:06,795
It's been quiet for 12 years.

409
00:55:08,463 --> 00:55:12,043
You should try embracing
the presence of the girls...

410
00:55:12,593 --> 00:55:15,256
instead of frightening them away.

411
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,736
You'll be better soon.

412
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:23,738
I don't think so.

413
00:55:25,662 --> 00:55:27,378
Not this time.

414
00:55:27,809 --> 00:55:29,646
But you have too.

415
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,419
You said we'll find
a new home.

416
00:55:34,438 --> 00:55:36,837
No one is going to
want me now.

417
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:38,929
I'll just be a burden.

418
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,731
But you swore we'll stay together.

419
00:55:43,278 --> 00:55:45,045
I take it back.

420
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:51,165
Maybe I won't get adopted.

421
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,006
You will.

422
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,779
You know why?

423
00:55:59,505 --> 00:56:01,491
Because you're special.

424
00:56:03,062 --> 00:56:07,914
You're going to get adopted by
a nice family somewhere

425
00:56:07,939 --> 00:56:10,604
and they're going to
spoil you so much.

426
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:13,036
You're going to have
so many dolls that...

427
00:56:13,061 --> 00:56:15,370
you won't even be able to
name all of them.

428
00:56:15,395 --> 00:56:17,027
Sure I can.

429
00:56:17,052 --> 00:56:18,717
Janice one.

430
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:21,122
Janice Two.
Janice Three.

431
00:56:22,664 --> 00:56:26,032
Linda.
Time for bed.

432
00:56:28,194 --> 00:56:30,715
Won't you come upstairs?

433
00:56:31,628 --> 00:56:33,713
I don't want to sleep alone.

434
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:37,022
Here.

435
00:56:38,109 --> 00:56:39,776
Take Becca.

436
00:56:40,172 --> 00:56:41,779
This way,

437
00:56:42,598 --> 00:56:44,383
I'll always be with you.

438
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,740
Then, you should have Sweet Sue.

439
00:56:52,654 --> 00:56:54,191
Thank you.

440
00:56:57,976 --> 00:57:00,661
Remember before
all of this.

441
00:57:00,981 --> 00:57:04,954
When we used to sneak around
the orphanage at night,

442
00:57:05,234 --> 00:57:07,932
And ate all the chocolate
of the pantry.

443
00:57:07,977 --> 00:57:11,817
Father Massey was convinced
that we had mice.

444
00:57:12,725 --> 00:57:17,460
Oh lord, please cleanse
my soul of my sins

445
00:57:17,485 --> 00:57:20,121
and cleanse our house of...

446
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:22,346
- these mice.
- these mice.

447
00:57:28,999 --> 00:57:31,302
Whatever happens

448
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:36,215
I was thinking always
all those things we did together.

449
00:57:38,971 --> 00:57:40,552
Good night, Linda.

450
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:42,702
Good night, Jan.

451
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

452
01:02:42,048 --> 01:02:44,685
A little sunlight will
do you some good.

453
01:02:44,851 --> 01:02:47,899
I don't the sunlight can fix
what's wrong with me.

454
01:02:49,149 --> 01:02:51,503
You mustn't give up hope.

455
01:02:53,056 --> 01:02:55,555
Hope is a home onto itself.

456
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:58,476
Dwell in it and it will
protect and keep you.

457
01:03:00,461 --> 01:03:02,682
What book of the bible
is that from?

458
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,499
The book of Charlotte.

459
01:03:07,401 --> 01:03:09,838
But that doesn't
make it any less so.

460
01:03:11,528 --> 01:03:13,125
Are you okay here?

461
01:03:14,854 --> 01:03:17,009
The sunlight actually
feels kind of nice.

462
01:03:17,034 --> 01:03:18,686
I told you.

463
01:03:56,264 --> 01:03:57,904
Sister Charlotte?

464
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No, no, no!
GOD HELP ME!

465
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

466
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:44,557
Janice!

467
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:48,826
Janice!

468
01:05:51,235 --> 01:05:52,529
What's going on?

469
01:05:55,503 --> 01:05:57,087
I couldn't get out.

470
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

471
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,170
I'm worry about Janice.

472
01:06:13,974 --> 01:06:16,044
A few nights ago
she wanted to leave.

473
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:17,565
Why she want to leave?

474
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:20,437
Probably because this place
is off the wall.

475
01:06:20,604 --> 01:06:24,095
She told me the Mullins's daughter
was coming for her.

476
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,496
The Mullins' had a daughter?

477
01:06:26,948 --> 01:06:29,210
She died a long time ago.

478
01:06:29,687 --> 01:06:31,873
So, she's seeing ghost?

479
01:06:33,551 --> 01:06:35,307
Keep your voice down.

480
01:06:35,655 --> 01:06:37,764
So, she's seeing ghost?

481
01:06:38,392 --> 01:06:39,865
I guess.

482
01:06:40,343 --> 01:06:43,271
Well...
You guys saw something.

483
01:06:43,658 --> 01:06:45,223
That wasn't a ghost.

484
01:06:45,248 --> 01:06:47,627
Ghost can only be
of dead people.

485
01:06:48,446 --> 01:06:50,760
How does that explain
what you saw?

486
01:06:50,937 --> 01:06:53,515
Unless it really was Mrs Mullins.

487
01:06:54,681 --> 01:06:59,059
Or...
something was just trying to scare you.

488
01:06:59,898 --> 01:07:02,570
You guys are doing a good job
with that on your own.

489
01:07:07,201 --> 01:07:11,436
Janice is probably just looking for ways
to justify us treating her differently.

490
01:07:12,212 --> 01:07:13,813
I don't think so.

491
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:15,154
Of course you don't.

492
01:07:15,179 --> 01:07:17,228
You'll know what I mean
when you're older.

493
01:07:17,521 --> 01:07:19,187
Now go get to bed.

494
01:07:54,173 --> 01:07:55,857
What are you waiting for?

495
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,495
Nothing.

496
01:08:01,897 --> 01:08:03,354
You like it?

497
01:08:04,082 --> 01:08:05,547
It's nice.

498
01:08:10,214 --> 01:08:12,254
It's not my finest work.

499
01:08:23,201 --> 01:08:24,855
You seem troubled.

500
01:08:25,815 --> 01:08:27,243
Maybe I can help.

501
01:08:28,822 --> 01:08:30,471
I don't think so.

502
01:08:30,701 --> 01:08:33,936
Talking about the things
that bothers us sometimes...

503
01:08:34,885 --> 01:08:36,749
all the help we need.

504
01:08:38,058 --> 01:08:39,306
Well.

505
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:43,140
It's Janice.

506
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,278
She's acting funny.

507
01:08:46,538 --> 01:08:48,184
Acting funny?

508
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:51,061
She says...

509
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,283
she's seen your daughter.

510
01:08:57,669 --> 01:08:59,211
My daughter...

511
01:09:01,953 --> 01:09:05,017
has been dead for a
very very long time

512
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:08,916
I know, but...

513
01:09:09,472 --> 01:09:12,851
You see,
Janice went into her bedroom.

514
01:09:12,876 --> 01:09:14,044
She what?

515
01:09:14,936 --> 01:09:17,771
She knows she wasn't suppose to
but...

516
01:09:17,796 --> 01:09:20,794
- she found this doll and...
- What doll?

517
01:09:21,598 --> 01:09:23,159
The one in the white dress.

518
01:09:23,184 --> 01:09:24,764
That's impossible!

519
01:09:24,789 --> 01:09:26,790
That doll was hidden away.

520
01:09:26,815 --> 01:09:28,702
She mustn't go near that doll!

521
01:09:28,727 --> 01:09:30,244
You understand me?

522
01:10:44,355 --> 01:10:45,855
Found you

523
01:10:57,695 --> 01:11:00,175
Janice, I told you
not to use that room.

524
01:11:00,729 --> 01:11:06,624
Please don't take
my sunshine away...

525
01:11:44,378 --> 01:11:46,218
Ahhh!

526
01:11:46,556 --> 01:11:47,919
Stay here.

527
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:51,653
Mr Mullins.

528
01:11:57,453 --> 01:11:59,558
Mr Mullins, are you okay?

529
01:12:18,227 --> 01:12:20,300
Go get ready for bed, girls.

530
01:12:20,325 --> 01:12:22,516
I need to speak to Mrs Mullins.

531
01:15:32,025 --> 01:15:34,859
Linda.
What are you doing?

532
01:15:35,393 --> 01:15:36,708
This doll.

533
01:15:36,733 --> 01:15:39,657
It's hurting Janice
and it killed Mr Mullins.

534
01:15:39,973 --> 01:15:41,617
I'm getting rid of it.

535
01:15:48,823 --> 01:15:50,663
Linda, let's go back.

536
01:16:05,682 --> 01:16:06,938
Linda?

537
01:16:14,017 --> 01:16:15,406
No!

538
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:34,596
What is that?

539
01:16:34,621 --> 01:16:36,499
Who cares!
Run!

540
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Janice. Janice.
I got rid of it.

541
01:16:48,902 --> 01:16:50,832
I got rid of the doll.

542
01:16:53,814 --> 01:16:55,176
Janice.

543
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:56,356
Janice.

544
01:16:56,636 --> 01:16:58,464
- What's going on?
- Where is Janice?

545
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,520
- I don't know.
- Go find her.

546
01:17:00,665 --> 01:17:01,839
Hurry!

547
01:17:07,503 --> 01:17:08,661
What's going on?

548
01:17:08,686 --> 01:17:09,635
No!

549
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:11,738
No!
Get that thing away from me!

550
01:17:14,702 --> 01:17:15,989
It's back.

551
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:18,143
I know it was back.

552
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:19,776
What is it?

553
01:17:21,114 --> 01:17:22,376
Evil.

554
01:17:23,335 --> 01:17:25,362
The devil itself.

555
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:27,974
What are you talking about?

556
01:17:29,231 --> 01:17:32,731
After Samuel and I...
lost our daughter

557
01:17:33,209 --> 01:17:36,566
we prayed and promised
our devotion to

558
01:17:36,591 --> 01:17:38,922
whatever power that
would allow us to

559
01:17:39,033 --> 01:17:42,814
speak or see our
beloved girl again.

560
01:17:43,841 --> 01:17:46,749
It started small,
the contact.

561
01:17:52,579 --> 01:17:54,152
But it was her.

562
01:17:54,731 --> 01:17:56,328
Our busy Bee.

563
01:17:56,717 --> 01:17:58,417
We know it was her.

564
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,792
She wanted permission
to move into the doll

565
01:18:02,817 --> 01:18:05,253
so she could be
with us forever.

566
01:18:16,466 --> 01:18:17,985
please

567
01:18:18,017 --> 01:18:19,725
We said yes.

568
01:18:19,821 --> 01:18:22,684
And that's when it became stronger.

569
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:28,122
Soon we can actually see her.

570
01:18:28,867 --> 01:18:32,229
Only in fleeting glimpses
but that was enough.

571
01:18:33,504 --> 01:18:35,423
Our beloved Bee.

572
01:18:35,969 --> 01:18:37,310
Our darling.

573
01:18:37,633 --> 01:18:39,214
Annabelle?

574
01:18:47,398 --> 01:18:49,555
Even though I couldn't hold her.

575
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:53,539
It was comforting to start
the past activity again.

576
01:18:57,769 --> 01:19:01,629
But we soon realised
it wasn't our Annabelle at all.

577
01:19:11,453 --> 01:19:17,002
You are my sunshine,
my only sunshine

578
01:19:17,699 --> 01:19:20,088
You make me happy ...

579
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:23,251
when skies are gray

580
01:19:24,766 --> 01:19:27,256
You'll never know dear,

581
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:30,146
how much I love you

582
01:19:30,971 --> 01:19:36,542
Please don't take my sunshine away

583
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:05,370
Esther?

584
01:20:06,264 --> 01:20:07,524
Esther.

585
01:20:12,242 --> 01:20:14,649
My... eye...

586
01:20:20,151 --> 01:20:22,351
It was a demonic presence.

587
01:20:22,376 --> 01:20:25,012
And it was using our
Annabelle to manipulate us

588
01:20:25,037 --> 01:20:27,721
into giving it soul
it couldn't have.

589
01:20:27,746 --> 01:20:29,648
It tried to take mine.

590
01:20:29,814 --> 01:20:32,490
Then Samuel reached out
to the church.

591
01:20:33,467 --> 01:20:35,035
They saved my soul

592
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:38,288
but the evil was still
attached to that doll.

593
01:20:39,539 --> 01:20:41,695
So we locked it away

594
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:44,900
where it could be surrounded
by the word of god.

595
01:21:29,138 --> 01:21:32,174
It was quiet
for all these year.

596
01:21:32,443 --> 01:21:34,886
I thought the evil was contained.

597
01:21:36,247 --> 01:21:39,477
We thought helping the girls
could be our penance.

598
01:21:39,872 --> 01:21:43,083
But we end up giving it
just what it wanted.

599
01:21:43,292 --> 01:21:47,932
You are my sunshine,
my only sunshine

600
01:21:47,957 --> 01:21:52,279
You make me happy
when skies are gray

601
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:56,670
- You'll never know dear,
- Janice.

602
01:21:56,695 --> 01:21:59,004
how much I love you

603
01:21:59,383 --> 01:22:03,059
Please don't take my sunshine away

604
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:04,619
She can walk.

605
01:22:05,076 --> 01:22:07,034
It's just us, Janice.

606
01:22:08,273 --> 01:22:10,588
Time to cease from sin, Carol.

607
01:22:17,308 --> 01:22:19,027
Sister Charlotte!
Sister Charlotte!

608
01:22:19,052 --> 01:22:20,370
It's-It's Janice.

609
01:22:20,433 --> 01:22:22,163
- She's... She's...
- Look what she did!

610
01:22:22,188 --> 01:22:23,957
- Carol, call for help.
- Okay.

611
01:22:23,982 --> 01:22:26,055
- And stay together.
- Okay.

612
01:22:31,107 --> 01:22:33,596
They're on their way.
Let get somewhere safe.

613
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:39,430
What do we do?

614
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:42,100
We can't just leave her here,
can we?

615
01:22:53,894 --> 01:22:55,454
Mrs Mullins?

616
01:22:58,065 --> 01:22:59,575
Mrs Mullins?

617
01:23:01,515 --> 01:23:03,102
Mrs Mullins?

618
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:22,626
Girls.

619
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,145
Let's go.
Now.

620
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:32,591
Forgive me, sister,
for I have sinned.

621
01:24:02,755 --> 01:24:04,662
- Sister Charlotte!
- Run. Come on!

622
01:24:08,574 --> 01:24:10,072
Linda!

623
01:24:12,173 --> 01:24:14,445
Go, Tierney!
Get help!

624
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,143
Or...

625
01:24:16,813 --> 01:24:18,494
... you can help me.

626
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,301
The truck!

627
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:35,540
Come on.
Come on.

628
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Close the door! Close the door!
Come on!
Go!
Go.

629
01:24:47,797 --> 01:24:49,717
No!
No!

630
01:24:53,472 --> 01:24:54,685
Okay.

631
01:24:56,499 --> 01:24:58,050
No!

632
01:24:58,270 --> 01:24:59,995
I'm trying!

633
01:25:10,031 --> 01:25:11,251
Guys!

634
01:25:14,655 --> 01:25:16,978
- Guys! Guys!
- What? What?

635
01:25:17,676 --> 01:25:19,025
The scarecrow.

636
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:20,839
What scarecrow?

637
01:25:26,326 --> 01:25:27,553
Get out!

638
01:25:47,150 --> 01:25:48,917
Come on!
Run!

639
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Carol?

640
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Nancy, I can't Ge the door open.
Is it locked?
Can you get it from your side?

641
01:26:10,288 --> 01:26:11,625
Girls.

642
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,099
Nancy?

643
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:46,416
No.

644
01:27:46,441 --> 01:27:47,713
No.
No.

645
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

646
01:29:07,694 --> 01:29:10,356
Lord, help me.
Lord, help.

647
01:29:10,381 --> 01:29:12,220
Help...

648
01:29:13,409 --> 01:29:14,793
Carol, it's me.

649
01:29:14,818 --> 01:29:16,259
It's just me.

650
01:29:16,873 --> 01:29:18,316
Now, come on.

651
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

652
01:31:29,872 --> 01:31:31,231

01:31:43,527 --> 01:31:44,678
No!

655
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:48,150
No!

656
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:07,182
Sister Charlotte?

657
01:33:33,436 --> 01:33:36,549
You know what I like most
about Sweet Sue?

658
01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:43,780
She looks just like you.

659
01:34:21,132 --> 01:34:22,559
Linda?

660
01:34:24,002 --> 01:34:26,685
Where are you, Linda?

661
01:34:30,229 --> 01:34:31,735
Linda?

662
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:47,329
Linda, I'm coming?

663
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:13,466
Found you!

664
01:35:16,095 --> 01:35:18,355
You swore if I found a home
you'd come too.

665
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:20,807
You know what they say
about breaking a swear.

666
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,512
You go straight to hell.

667
01:35:22,537 --> 01:35:23,689
Janice!

668
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:31,849
Forgive me.

669
01:35:32,795 --> 01:35:33,997
No!

670
01:35:35,742 --> 01:35:37,245
Let me out!

671
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:38,870
Let me out!

672
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Let me out... !

673
01:36:23,156 --> 01:36:24,346
Go!

674
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:35,851
- Sister Charlotte!
- Sister Charlotte!

675
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:16,096
Anything?

676
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:18,106
I'm afraid not.

677
01:38:18,543 --> 01:38:20,403
Still no sign of the girl.

678
01:38:20,613 --> 01:38:22,469
But at her age...

679
01:38:23,031 --> 01:38:24,861
how far could she'd gone?

680
01:38:27,190 --> 01:38:28,838
Don't worry.

681
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:31,119
We'll find her.

682
01:38:38,181 --> 01:38:40,055
This house is blessed.

683
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:43,375
Whatever evil was here
is no longer.

684
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:45,712
But...

685
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:47,740
The doll.

686
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:50,791
It was a conduit
for the evil.

687
01:38:50,816 --> 01:38:53,016
That evil has moved on.

688
01:38:53,410 --> 01:38:55,677
Now the doll
is just a doll.

689
01:38:55,796 --> 01:38:57,109
So...

690
01:38:57,990 --> 01:38:59,970
... which one of you gets this?

691
01:39:25,466 --> 01:39:27,270
How are you holding up?

692
01:39:29,592 --> 01:39:31,249
I'm okay.

693
01:39:34,056 --> 01:39:37,632
You know, that wasn't Janice back there.
That was...

694
01:39:39,010 --> 01:39:40,748
... something else.

695
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:46,223
I know.

696
01:40:24,212 --> 01:40:26,037
ST. JOACHIM
ORPHANAGE

697
01:40:26,062 --> 01:40:28,392
Hi there.
Welcome.

698
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:30,460
Let's go right inside, shall we?

699
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:36,075
She mostly keeps to herself,
that can be a bit quite.

700
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:37,914
but she's a lovely girl.

701
01:40:37,939 --> 01:40:40,280
She's just been through a lot.

702
01:40:41,510 --> 01:40:43,570
I think you will love her.

703
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,660
Hello.

704
01:40:48,057 --> 01:40:50,370
There's someone here to see you, sweetie.

705
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:56,813
I want to introduce you to
Mr and Mrs Higgins.

706
01:40:58,430 --> 01:41:00,975
And you must be...

707
01:41:01,086 --> 01:41:03,416
- Annabelle.
- Annabelle.

708
01:41:03,441 --> 01:41:05,428
What a lovely name.

709
01:41:06,562 --> 01:41:08,438
We brought you a present.

710
01:41:11,870 --> 01:41:13,840
I hope you like dolls.

711
01:41:42,458 --> 01:41:50,394
12 YEARS LATER

712
01:42:00,927 --> 01:42:02,666
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

713
01:42:02,691 --> 01:42:03,981
What is it?

714
01:42:04,126 --> 01:42:05,219
Stay here.

715
01:42:05,244 --> 01:42:06,687
No, no, no!
No, wait.

716
01:42:06,712 --> 01:42:07,872
It's okay.
It's alright, sweetheart.

717
01:42:07,897 --> 01:42:09,213
I'm just going to
take a quick look.

718
01:42:09,238 --> 01:42:10,941
Call the police.

719
01:42:24,826 --> 01:42:27,289
- Annabelle?
- Hi, Mom.

720
01:42:50,036 --> 01:42:51,419
John.
