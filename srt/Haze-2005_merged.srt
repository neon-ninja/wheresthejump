A Shinya TSUKAMOTO Film

3
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,831
Hey, hey, hold it,

4
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,359
What the hell...!!

5
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,629
What the hell...!!

6
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,956
What's happening!
What's going on here!

7
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,958
Let me think.....

8
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,716
Let me think....

9
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,557
Can't think!

10
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,030
What's going on?!

11
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,832
It's got to be a dream,

12
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,716
A fucking dream!

13
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,630
That must be it,

14
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,669
I won't feel pain if it is a dream,

15
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,279
What's happening?

16
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,479
Where the hell was I before this?

17
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,918
This can't be real,

18
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,475
Think!

19
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,836
Think, man! It's not a dream,

20
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,712
Shit... think...

21
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,237
Damn it!

22
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,593
Lost my memory by chance?

23
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,518
Calm down.

24
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,555
I'm sure I'll remember soon.

25
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,520
Hell!
What was...?

26
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,914
Where did I come from?
Where?

27
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

28
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,228
Perhaps...

29
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,397
The war may have broken out?

30
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,275
Was I taken prisoner?

31
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,589
Or has some kind of cult brainwashed
me?

32
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,558
They did steal my memory then?

33
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,309
Was I a member of the cult?

34
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,472
No I wasn't,

35
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,918
Maybe I was?

36
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,714
No way,

37
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,919
Or perhaps some rich pervert is playing a
trick on me?

38
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,634
God damn it!

39
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,872
Fuck!

40
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,710
I'm sorry,

41
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,670
I'm sorry,

42
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:02,040
I found myself here, in the
middle of nowhere.

43
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,676
Umm... can you tell me...

44
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,599
...why we are here?

45
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,998
You can't either.

46
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,470
You are bleeding, too!

47
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,029
This must be our last resting place.

48
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,910
I will...

49
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,350
...get out of here.

50
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,909
What about you?

51
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,273
What?

52
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,477
But how?

53
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,832
I've crawled all over the place.

54
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,994
There's no way out.

55
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,998
We'll die before reaching the exit.

56
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,551
We'll get out the way we came.

57
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,879
See the ditch over there.

58
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,589
I think the ditch is where
people enter

59
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,229
Some drowned.

60
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,874
Some managed to crawl up here.

61
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:52,553
But they all end up being mutilated and
brought here.

62
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,430
Who'd do that?

63
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,678
Don't know.

64
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,878
It seems to be a really big
and dark thing.

65
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,873
I wonder if it is a human being.

66
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,959
You find yourself in
total darkness...

67
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,473
...being dismembered...

68
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,039
...and floating in the water.

69
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,672
If you see nothing ahead...

70
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,634
you eventually end up here...

71
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,958
and floating in the water.

72
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,993
More or less.

73
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,350
That's what we will end up like.

74
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:01,237
You will be one of them if you
don't move now.

75
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,635
But how are we going to move?

76
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,836
Tell me how?

77
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,836
You are remembering someone's
face, right?

78
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,876
Me too.

79
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,948
If you open your mind...

80
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,515
how can I put it...

81
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,389
you will see a flash of
cherished memory...

82
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,879
I saw something else, too.

83
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,909
I saw fireworks.

84
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,989
Fireworks... fireworks... fireworks...

85
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,792
I used to like them a lot.

86
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,480
I was watching them...

87
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,751
...over the cold landscape.

88
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:45,910
There is no sign of anyone setting
off the fireworks.

89
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:55,838
It's as if the fireworks
had a life of their own.

90
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,832
Hey...

91
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,713
Hey, don't sleep.

92
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,911
Did I sleep long?

93
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,359
Seconds...
I woke you right away.

94
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,438
I just had a dream of waking
up somewhere.

95
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,838
A dream of being awake?

96
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,916
I found myself...

97
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,349
...waking up alone in a room.

98
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,040
It was already dark.

99
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,349
I must have dozed off.

100
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,429
I remember the TV was showing a
still image of a town.

101
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,956
The weather forecast...

102
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,278
...was scrolling at the bottom of the
screen all the time.

103
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,789
I felt Ionely.

104
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,229
It was like falling into a
place like this.

105
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,992
It was so scary!

106
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,789
It may be the place you
were before here.

107
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,638
Nothing spectacular is
waiting for us...

108
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,877
...even if we get out of
here anyway.

109
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,830
Perhaps.

110
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,033
I must go.

111
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,029
Are you sure you're not coming?

112
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,713
Alright. I'm off now.

113
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,955
You're serious.

114
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,352
I've got no time.

115
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,753
Hey, hey...
You can't go that way.

116
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,799
Come with me?

117
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,955
Thanks.

118
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,396
What?!

119
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,475
Nothing. Just go!

120
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,678
Go!

121
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,276
What now?

122
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,398
What?!

123
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,836
We'll dive from now on.

124
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:38,918
No...

125
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,875
We're finished.

126
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,836
That hurt!

127
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,668
My stomach...

128
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,030
Let's go back.

129
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,273
We should be back.

130
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,879
Yes, we do.

131
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,992
Get back there.

132
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,954
Listen to me, will you?

133
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,996
We'll think when we get back.

134
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,397
I remember something.

135
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,790
I wanted to go somewhere.

136
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:56,517
Someone imprisoned me here...
before I could run away.

137
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,679
Somewhere?

138
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:09,038
You mean a war broke out...
and we're imprisoned?

139
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,956
I doubt it?

140
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,398
I knew it.

141
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,393
A rich pervert is playing a trick
on us for fun?

142
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,319
Still strange...

143
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,437
Why the hell would anyone set up
such a grand stage...

144
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,360
...based on your fears and then imprison
us?

145
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,559
What business does he
have with you?

146
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,316
It is probably to make me to
want to go back.

147
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,315
"Go back"?

148
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,676
Where to?
What are you talking about?

149
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,873
Please do not give up!

150
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,670
I'm sorry,

151
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,393
God damn it!

152
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,278
I knew it!

153
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,511
That fucking pervert...

154
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,995
...is doing this!

155
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:23,990
So you got out...
good... good...

156
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,837
Are you sure of that?

157
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,749
Yes,

158
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,951
Getting away with me?

159
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,835
Yes,

160
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,953
I wonder what went wrong,

161
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,719
Never mind that,

162
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,758
I'm ready to escape,

163
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:30,951
Someone imprisoned me here
before I could run away,

164
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,752
I'll help you.

165
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,752
I'll save you.

166
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,029
