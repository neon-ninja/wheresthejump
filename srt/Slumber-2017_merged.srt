1
00:00:05,508 --> 00:00:07,355
I wonder if she'll come
back again.

2
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:08,969
I wonder if she comes
again.

3
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:13,280
I wonder if she'll
come back again.

4
00:00:13,282 --> 00:00:15,659
I wonder if she comes again.

5
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:17,450
I wonder if she'll come
back again.

6
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:20,097
I wonder if she comes
again. I wonder...

7
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:29,236
I wonder if she comes tonight.
I wonder what games we'll play.

8
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,441
If she comes again tonight,
I wonder what games we'll play.

9
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:50,496
Okay, that sounds fun.

10
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:02,909
Her name's Alice. She's six.

11
00:01:27,502 --> 00:01:30,238
Ready or not, here I come.

12
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:40,016
Liam?

13
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:48,859
Where are you?

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Liam, you're sleep walking
again.

15
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:01,172
There you are, next to my
sister.

16
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:06,944
This isn't funny!
I'm gonna tell Mom!

17
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:13,082
Liam, you're scaring me.

18
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:14,485
Get away from me!

19
00:02:14,487 --> 00:02:16,186
Liam, stop it!

20
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:20,159
Alice! Help me! Alice!

21
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,183
<i>So why don't you tell me...</i>

22
00:02:43,185 --> 00:02:46,519
<i>a little bit about your
nightmare?</i>

23
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:49,388
<i>I first saw it as a child...</i>

24
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,025
<i>standing in the shadows at the
end of my bed.</i>

25
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:56,531
<i>It's hard to describe
what it looks like.</i>

26
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,967
<i>This figure in the darkness.</i>

27
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:02,402
<i>It didn't have a face.</i>

28
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:05,573
<i>I wake up. I can't move.</i>

29
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:08,477
<i>Like I'm paralyzed.</i>

30
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,980
The room gets
<i>darker and darker.</i>

31
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:14,615
<i>That's when I know it's coming.</i>

32
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:16,451
<i>It happens to me every night.</i>

33
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:18,487
<i>I don't wanna sleep any more.</i>

34
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,157
<i>And there's this pressure on my
chest...</i>

35
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,492
<i>this huge force.</i>

36
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,295
<i>It's like something's holding
you down.</i>

37
00:03:26,297 --> 00:03:27,696
<i>I feel terrified.</i>

38
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:29,432
<i>I knew it was there.</i>

39
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:33,671
<i>I could feel it in the darkness
just... watching me.</i>

40
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:35,338
<i>I feel trapped.</i>

41
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,308
<i>I wasn't able to move any part
of my body.</i>

42
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,010
<i>I could only move my eyes
back and forth.</i>

43
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,511
<i>And then I saw this figure...</i>

44
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,614
<i>coming towards me and I...</i>

45
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:46,284
<i>I couldn't make it out,
because it was black.</i>

46
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:49,154
<i>You'd be surprised how
many people are affected.</i>

47
00:03:49,156 --> 00:03:52,156
I think some people don't even
like to talk about it.

48
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,126
<i>Every fiber of your body...</i>

49
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:56,529
<i>is telling you it's something
evil.</i>

50
00:03:56,531 --> 00:04:00,767
<i>It looks like this old
woman, a haggard old woman...</i>

51
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:06,305
<i>with these cold, dark eyes.</i>

52
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:10,177
<i>It's not like a nightmare,
it's... it's something else.</i>

53
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:15,416
<i>It had such power.
I felt completely helpless.</i>

54
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:18,820
<i>You don't know what it's like.
It's like a curse.</i>

55
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:20,587
<i>You wanna run,
you wanna scream...</i>

56
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,289
<i>but it won't let you.</i>

57
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,292
<i>The thing was well
over six foot.</i>

58
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:25,794
<i>I think it was seven feet tall.</i>

59
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:28,229
<i>It was like this
moving darkness.</i>

60
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:31,132
<i>It was the greatest terror
I've ever experienced.</i>

61
00:04:31,134 --> 00:04:33,601
<i>The shadow man is violent.</i>

62
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:35,304
<i>The hag, she takes hold of me...</i>

63
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:37,338
<i>and I think I'm gonna die.</i>

64
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,675
<i>Well, you know
it's coming back.</i>

65
00:04:39,677 --> 00:04:41,776
<i>It is always coming back
for you.</i>

Not as sweet as you.

Has Henry had his breakfast yet?

76
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:48,616
He had six peanuts!

77
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:49,383
Six.

78
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:50,551
Oh, six.

79
00:05:50,553 --> 00:05:51,887
You ready for your test?

80
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:52,888
Yeah.

81
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,422
Ah, excuse me.

82
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:56,191
Yes!

83
00:05:56,193 --> 00:05:57,360
Who's this?

84
00:05:57,362 --> 00:06:00,829
Erm, it's you. You're flying.

85
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,865
Oh, super mom!

86
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:06,269
It's very nice.
Where am I flying to?

87
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:08,539
I don't know. Nowhere, I guess.

88
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,274
Do you like it?

89
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:13,609
I love it.

90
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:16,647
One, two, three.

91
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:18,583
Oh, my gosh, every time.

92
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:19,850
Loser!

93
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:21,386
You can't kiss the artist!

94
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:22,587
Yes, I can!

95
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:24,888
Okay, artist, time to go!

96
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,290
<i>And I kept trying to breathe...</i>

97
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,792
<i>and I couldn't breathe...</i>

98
00:06:27,794 --> 00:06:32,231
<i>and I was telling myself, like,
Michelle, wake-up.</i>

99
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:37,336
<i>Wake-up. Breathe. Get out
of bed. Move.</i>

100
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:42,208
<i>Like, do something, you're
okay, but I couldn't.</i>

101
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,945
So, in turn, her brain
is not allowing her...

102
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,845
to go into REM-deep sleep.

103
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:49,448
This is what's causing her
parasomnia episodes...

104
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,885
sleep talking, scary night
terrors.

105
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:56,324
Seeing things that aren't
really there, yeah.

106
00:06:56,326 --> 00:07:00,328
You know, it's a lot more common
condition than you might think.

107
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,598
Even my own daughter, she goes
through this sometimes.

108
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,373
And because of what we know now,
it's easily treatable.

109
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:15,243
Hm, today's dream drawing:
who is it?

110
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:17,512
It's meant to be me, flying.

111
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:19,948
Hm, floating more like.

112
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,651
If I drew my dreams,
I'd get arrested.

113
00:07:22,653 --> 00:07:24,453
That's because you're a
sociopath, Malcolm.

114
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:26,891
Shh, they'll hear.

115
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,493
What about you?

116
00:07:30,495 --> 00:07:32,262
What about me?

117
00:07:32,264 --> 00:07:35,565
What creepy things have you got
lurking in your dreams?

118
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:39,036
Dr. Arnolds, the Morgans
have arrived.

119
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,837
I thought they weren't coming
until 3:00?

120
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,643
I told them they were early, but
they seemed a little... on edge.

121
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:46,479
Okay.

122
00:07:49,683 --> 00:07:52,717
Why don't you tell me a little
bit about what's been going on?

123
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:58,723
Erm, about two months ago our
baby boy, he...

124
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:03,728
He passed away... in his sleep.

125
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,363
- Let it go.
- Stop it!

126
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:07,301
Charlie... please.

127
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:09,068
I'm so sorry.

128
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:16,409
Um, around the same time,
we started to find Daniel, um...

129
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:18,913
sleepwalking and... and sleep
talking...

130
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,915
sometimes even screaming.

131
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,451
He's had episodes like this
before.

132
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:29,356
But then we started to find him
asleep, we think...

133
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:35,630
but with his eyes open,
chest heaving, trying to talk...

134
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:39,768
but his whole body's paralyzed.

135
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,772
Daniel, you've been experiencing
sleep paralysis.

136
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,674
That's when you think
you're awake...

137
00:08:45,676 --> 00:08:47,410
but your brain is still
dreaming.

138
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:50,012
You can open your eyes
and look around the room...

139
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:53,617
but your body can't move,
because you're still asleep.

140
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:55,486
You feel trapped.

141
00:08:55,488 --> 00:08:57,854
Your mind tells you that there's
something else in the room.

142
00:08:57,856 --> 00:09:00,993
Something bad, something
pressing down on your chest.

143
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,133
It's all up here, honey.
It's all in our imagination.

144
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:12,370
I know it can be scary, but
there are no ghosts or goblins.

145
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:15,909
See, honey, what did
I tell you? Huh?

146
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:23,952
Why don't both of you come
and get one of these? Mm.

147
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:26,652
- What do you say?
- Here, sweetie.

148
00:09:26,654 --> 00:09:27,887
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

149
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:28,991
You're welcome.

150
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:35,028
Losing a loved one, as you
both know...

151
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,096
can take a very heavy
psychological toll...

152
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:38,765
especially on children.

153
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:41,569
So I wouldn't be surprised
if this tragedy...

154
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:44,539
acted as a trigger for Daniel's
nocturnal behavior.

155
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:48,410
But, you know, we will run some
tests while he's here and...

156
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:50,111
you know, I wouldn't worry.

157
00:09:50,113 --> 00:09:51,746
I haven't run into a single
person...

158
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:53,681
who's issues haven't been
resolvable.

159
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:55,417
But it's not just him.

160
00:09:55,419 --> 00:10:00,488
We've all started having these
terrible dreams.

161
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,791
Sleepwalking and sleep talking.

162
00:10:01,793 --> 00:10:03,725
I'm sorry, I'm confused...

163
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:06,797
which one of you is staying
with us tomorrow night?

164
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,867
All of us.

165
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,682
Okay.

166
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:26,216
Thank you, my dear.

167
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:28,686
You're welcome. Goodnight.

168
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:31,526
Goodnight, Mr. Futterman.

169
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,808
And when Gretel opened her
apron, the pearls...

170
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,777
and precious stones were
scattered all over the room...

171
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:55,516
and Hansel took one handful
after another out of his pocket.

172
00:10:55,518 --> 00:11:01,725
Then was all care at an end and
they lived happily ever after.

173
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:07,796
When the witch died, did she
go to heaven?

174
00:11:07,798 --> 00:11:10,599
Not everybody gets into heaven.

175
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:14,639
Only the good people, like your
baby brother.

176
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:22,144
Time for bed, Daniel.

177
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:24,614
I don't wanna go to sleep.

178
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:26,581
Then why don't you do your
multiplication tables...

179
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,083
like the nice doctor said.

180
00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:30,056
So you won't think about
the bad things.

181
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,766
I don't want it to come again.

182
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,935
Oh, sweetie, that's just
a nightmare...

183
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,939
but this is a good, strong
house...

184
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,941
with good, strong, brave
children.

185
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,111
Show me the money.

186
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,250
Grrr. Mini muscle man.

187
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:00,618
Can Alfie sleep with us tonight?

188
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,057
Sure.

189
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:08,964
Love you both. Sleep tight.

190
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:24,010
Dr. Arnolds!

191
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Dammit, Cam!
Sorry.
Oh, gosh.
I have to get this coffee to
Malcolm in observation.

192
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:34,356
He's probably having a caffeine
melt-down by now.

193
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:38,160
Hey, what do you guys do
in that little cave anyway?

194
00:12:38,162 --> 00:12:42,265
The observation room?
We observe.

195
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:44,169
Oh, that's genius.

196
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:08,695
Two times three is six.

197
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,735
Three times three, nine.

198
00:13:17,738 --> 00:13:20,309
Four times three, twelve.

199
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:26,280
Five times three, fifteen.

200
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:31,351
Six times three, eighteen.

201
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,996
Maybe it's safer if I stay
on the couch tonight?

202
00:13:41,998 --> 00:13:43,765
You know, just in case...

203
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:49,607
No, I want you here.
Close to me.

204
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:56,848
It's gonna be okay,
we'll figure it out.

205
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:56,176
What?

206
00:14:56,178 --> 00:15:00,147
Alice, you all right?

207
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,984
Yeah... yeah, I was just resting
my eyes and I...

208
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,357
um, I nodded off.

209
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:12,029
Why don't you go home?
I have this covered.

210
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:16,367
Thanks, Malcolm.

211
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:37,289
- Hey.
- Hey.

212
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:08,053
No, no, they're gonna get me.

213
00:16:08,055 --> 00:16:11,157
They're gonna get me.

214
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:13,194
Don't want them to get me.

215
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:30,945
I don't wanna die.

216
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,471
Daddy needs a smoothie.

217
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:58,311
Daddy needs a smoothie.
Daddy needs...

218
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:02,182
Daddy needs a smoothie.

219
00:17:04,283 --> 00:17:06,453
Daddy needs a smoothie.

220
00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:11,926
Your Daddy needs a smoothie.

221
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:27,538
It's you... yeah, that's right.

222
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,247
I don't want it to get me.
I don't want it to get me.

223
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:40,222
I don't want it to come again.

224
00:17:53,937 --> 00:18:00,344
That's right, who is Daddy's
boy? It's you.

225
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:17,931
I don't want it to come again.
I don't want it to come again.

226
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,301
I don't want it to get me.

227
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,480
Hey, boo-boo.
Hey, boo-boo-boo.

228
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:36,684
I hate you.

229
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,387
I hate you!

230
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:53,136
Mommy... help me.

231
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:03,112
I hate you!

232
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:09,053
Why?

233
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,294
I don't want it to get me.

234
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:25,734
What's wrong with my teeth?

235
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:27,369
I hate you!

236
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:36,112
- I hate you!
- Emily, wake up!

237
00:19:36,114 --> 00:19:37,479
Wake up.

238
00:19:39,718 --> 00:19:41,419
Daniel...

239
00:19:41,421 --> 00:19:43,023
Dad!

240
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:14,186
Here's your picture, Mom.

241
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:16,355
So what did you dream
about this time?

242
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:17,491
Niamh!

243
00:20:17,493 --> 00:20:19,460
Sorry.

244
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:20,793
It's okay. It's okay, honey.
It's just an accident.

245
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:24,197
Just grab your school bag.

246
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:25,566
You...?

247
00:20:25,568 --> 00:20:26,770
Fine.

248
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,641
Hey.

249
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:36,743
Hey, what's going on?

250
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:40,247
I'm just tired.

251
00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:44,088
There was a boy yesterday, and
he reminded me of my brother.

252
00:20:45,755 --> 00:20:49,725
Hey, why don't you go back
to bed for a while, huh?

253
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:51,830
You probably only slept
a couple of hours?

254
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:38,781
Ready or not, here I come.

255
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:00,402
Liam?

256
00:22:03,473 --> 00:22:06,410
There you are, next to my
sister.

257
00:22:08,646 --> 00:22:10,916
No, Liam, there's no one there.
It's just me.

258
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:17,356
Liam!

259
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,456
Alice! Help me!

260
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,326
Liam!

261
00:22:22,328 --> 00:22:23,830
Alice! Alice!

262
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:47,585
You two will be sleeping
in here with your parents...

263
00:22:47,587 --> 00:22:49,423
so you'll feel nice and safe,
okay?

264
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:53,426
What's that?

265
00:22:53,428 --> 00:22:56,729
That is a polysomnogram device.

266
00:22:56,731 --> 00:23:01,333
It helps us figure out why
you're not sleeping properly.

267
00:23:01,335 --> 00:23:04,536
And this monitors your brain
waves...

268
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:07,842
your eye movements, your muscle
tone and your breathing.

269
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,710
And this right here measures
your heart rate.

270
00:23:10,712 --> 00:23:12,648
You look like an alien.

271
00:23:16,018 --> 00:23:20,022
That's stupid. She does not.

272
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,859
Well, not a scary alien, right?

273
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:33,705
Mr. Morgan.

274
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:39,510
It helps me sleep.

275
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:43,846
We had another terrible night
last night.

276
00:23:43,848 --> 00:23:47,418
You got no idea how much
we need this to work.

277
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,258
Oh, believe me, I do.
Let's get you back in.

278
00:23:59,765 --> 00:24:02,000
There's a night vision camera
in the corner of the room...

279
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:03,902
we'll be keeping an eye
on everything...

280
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:05,671
you do while you sleep.

281
00:24:05,673 --> 00:24:07,709
So will this stop me from
killing all the teddy bears?

282
00:24:12,647 --> 00:24:16,051
Can't we just never sleep?
Please?

283
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,587
I don't want it to come again.

284
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,021
You don't want what to come
again?

285
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:23,956
Daniel, we've already talked
about this.

286
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:27,093
We're the only ones in the room.
Okay? They're just dreams.

287
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:28,896
We need to get a good night's
sleep.

288
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:31,534
That's how we're going to get
fixed, sweetie.

289
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:36,506
Will you help me, Dr. Alice?

290
00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:41,344
Of course I will. That's my job.

291
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:50,889
Everything's gonna be
fine. See you in the morning.

292
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:54,524
Did you check
on Mr. Futterman?

293
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,462
Yes I did, and he's asleep.

294
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:42,041
They're definitely shook up.
The father just lost his job.

295
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:43,911
He seems to be drinking.

296
00:25:43,913 --> 00:25:45,846
And his knuckles...

297
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:49,516
he says that he's punching the
walls while he's sleep walking...

298
00:25:49,518 --> 00:25:53,020
which is enough to give
anyone nightmares.

299
00:25:53,022 --> 00:25:56,558
Do you remember the, er,
Mitchell case?

300
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,762
It must have been, well, at
least a decade ago now.

301
00:26:01,764 --> 00:26:03,831
I don't think so.
What was his first name?

302
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:08,636
Dan Mitchell. He was a farmer
over in Winnetka County.

303
00:26:08,638 --> 00:26:11,607
- No.
- Popular guy by all accounts...

304
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:12,875
went to church every Sunday.

305
00:26:12,877 --> 00:26:14,777
Not a bad word to be said
about him.

306
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:20,483
Anyway, this guy was a chicken
farmer with a few dozen coops.

307
00:26:20,485 --> 00:26:21,851
His family and friends
knew him...

308
00:26:21,853 --> 00:26:25,856
as a sleepwalker and a sleep
worker.

309
00:26:25,858 --> 00:26:27,156
Every night he used to go out...

310
00:26:27,158 --> 00:26:28,926
and do his farm chores while
he slept.

311
00:26:28,928 --> 00:26:31,564
Fill the feeders, sweep the
floor, clean out the muck.

312
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,032
Every night like clockwork.

313
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:37,767
It sounds pretty useful.

314
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:41,105
Yeah, maybe to begin with.

315
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:46,678
Turns out, the whole family had
a history of parasomnia.

316
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,849
One night, while he was seeing
to the chickens in his sleep...

317
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:55,721
he thought there was an intruder
in his house.

318
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:57,689
He got into a fight with the
attacker...

319
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:59,661
trying to defend his daughter.

320
00:27:01,763 --> 00:27:05,766
By the time they woke him,
it was too late.

321
00:27:05,768 --> 00:27:09,637
He'd hacked his wife to death
with a shovel.

322
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:11,604
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

323
00:27:11,606 --> 00:27:14,007
And he was really asleep
when he did it?

324
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:17,812
Well, he passed all the lie
detector tests.

325
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:20,218
Even his daughter backed up
the story.

326
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:27,122
Daniel said he didn't want 'it'
to come again.

327
00:27:27,124 --> 00:27:29,592
What do you think he meant
by that?

328
00:27:31,296 --> 00:27:34,095
Oh, shit, Mr. Futterman's gone.

329
00:27:34,097 --> 00:27:36,097
Well, he's probably gone
to the bathroom.

330
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:38,567
I'll go and check.

331
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:40,873
Why don't you go and get us
some more coffee.

332
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:18,848
Mr. Futterman?

333
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:38,698
I fucking told them.
I said no!

334
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No! No! No, no.

335
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:28,689
No... I... don't...

336
00:30:06,964 --> 00:30:12,169
I don't... I didn't...

337
00:30:56,483 --> 00:30:58,920
I didn't do anything.

338
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:12,836
Ready or not, here I come.

339
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:40,997
Alice, guess where I found
Futterman?

340
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,933
He was sleep walking in the
shower. Can you believe it?

341
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,979
Daniel?

342
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,848
Daniel!

343
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,854
Malcolm?

344
00:32:02,856 --> 00:32:04,923
Oh, my God.

345
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:06,992
Daniel, Daniel just breathe.

346
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:11,163
You're okay. Take it easy,
you're all right.

347
00:32:11,165 --> 00:32:15,333
You'll be okay. Okay, just
breathe. It'll be all right.

348
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:19,574
That's a good boy.
Take it easy. That's it.

349
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
- I won't let you!
- Let go of me!
Dad, no! Stop!
Give him back.

350
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:40,131
Dad! Stop!

351
00:32:48,271 --> 00:32:50,508
Alice, are you okay?

352
00:33:07,358 --> 00:33:09,125
I don't think he knew
what he was doing.

353
00:33:09,127 --> 00:33:10,427
Alice.

354
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:12,162
I think he was sleep walking.

355
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:15,399
Alice, imagine
if it was one of his kids...

356
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:20,003
he grabbed by the throat,
or hacked up with a shovel!

357
00:33:20,005 --> 00:33:22,440
You saw the bruises
on Daniel's chest.

358
00:33:22,442 --> 00:33:24,942
That man might not be
consciously abusive...

359
00:33:24,944 --> 00:33:27,144
but he's an alcoholic,
he's dangerous...

360
00:33:27,146 --> 00:33:28,617
and he shouldn't be around them.

361
00:33:30,451 --> 00:33:32,921
This was the right thing to do.

362
00:33:36,022 --> 00:33:39,223
Alice, you should go home.

363
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:44,166
Be with your family. God...
forget about this for now.

364
00:34:57,778 --> 00:35:00,713
Oh!

365
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the hell are you doing?
Niamh!

366
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,459
You need to stay
home and rest.

367
00:35:12,461 --> 00:35:14,727
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

368
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:17,097
- I am.
- You do not... fine.

369
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:18,398
You were saying 'help me'...

370
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,404
over and over in your sleep
last night.

371
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,472
It was just a dream.
It's not a big deal.

372
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:27,842
Alice, you were attacked.
It's a big fucking deal!

373
00:35:27,844 --> 00:35:29,113
Christ...

374
00:35:44,196 --> 00:35:46,161
Alice, what are you doing here?

375
00:35:46,163 --> 00:35:48,400
Come here and take a look
at this.

376
00:35:52,505 --> 00:35:54,537
Fascinating...

377
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:58,408
they're all in REM sleep, but
it's like they're synchronized.

378
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,510
- Like puppets.
- Hm.

379
00:36:00,512 --> 00:36:03,613
Yeah, except for Daniel.

380
00:36:03,615 --> 00:36:07,551
They all seem to be moving
away from him.

381
00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:12,623
I've never seen such an intense
sleep paralysis episode before.

382
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:14,828
He looks terrified.

383
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:22,568
Hey. Hey, guys. I just wanted
to let you know...

384
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,637
I don't work for the hospital
anymore.

385
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:26,338
I, er, handed in my resignation,
so...

386
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,740
What?

387
00:36:27,742 --> 00:36:31,777
Dr. Arnolds, would you mind
a word outside?

388
00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:34,450
Of course.

389
00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:40,755
<i>Paging
Dr. Davies. Dr. Davies, please.</i>

390
00:36:40,757 --> 00:36:42,490
Cam, are you okay?

391
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,392
Look, stay away from that
family.

392
00:36:44,394 --> 00:36:47,264
Never see them again.

393
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:55,507
Cam... Cam, what are you...?

394
00:38:01,877 --> 00:38:05,312
- What's that?
- Oh, nothing, honey.

395
00:38:05,314 --> 00:38:07,381
Boring stuff.

396
00:38:07,383 --> 00:38:10,253
Work stuff.

397
00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:14,256
I'm sorry I yelled at you
this morning.

398
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:16,625
It's okay.

399
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:27,305
Let's get into your
PJ's, Danny.

400
00:38:49,863 --> 00:38:54,999
Did your father do this to you,
Daniel?

401
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:56,938
Then who did?

402
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:06,348
I told you already... it only
comes when I'm dreaming.

403
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:14,421
From the shadows.

404
00:41:54,864 --> 00:41:57,931
I don't want it to get me.
I don't want it to get me.

405
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:59,902
I don't want it to get me.

406
00:42:22,692 --> 00:42:24,595
Get away from me!

407
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,858
Oh, my God.

408
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:31,332
Emily... wake up. Wake up.

409
00:43:31,334 --> 00:43:33,602
Mummy, what's going on?

410
00:43:33,604 --> 00:43:35,769
Close your eyes, sweetie.
Close your eyes.

411
00:43:37,207 --> 00:43:38,843
What's going on?

412
00:43:45,716 --> 00:43:47,849
Mom, I don't want
to stay here.

413
00:43:47,851 --> 00:43:50,288
Ssh! Don't move, honey.

414
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Daniel! Daniel!
No! Agh!

415
00:44:25,893 --> 00:44:27,830
Daniel!

416
00:45:02,899 --> 00:45:04,233
Honey?

417
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:07,804
Hey.

418
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:10,074
I'm having that nightmare again.

419
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,349
Why didn't you tell me?

420
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:21,787
Because something about this
feels different.

421
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:25,856
I just... I...

422
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:29,393
I heard that little girl singing
the same lullaby...

423
00:45:29,395 --> 00:45:33,833
that Liam sung the night
that he died and I just erm...

424
00:45:35,134 --> 00:45:37,134
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

425
00:45:37,136 --> 00:45:41,841
Hey... it's stress,
that's all it is, it's stress.

426
00:45:41,843 --> 00:45:43,045
Hm?

427
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:53,487
I thought about what you said...
and you're right.

428
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:57,357
I need to slow down,
and I need to get some sleep.

429
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:01,297
So I'm gonna go into work and
I'm gonna ask for some time off.

430
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:05,468
Hallelujah.

431
00:46:17,982 --> 00:46:21,283
Dr. Arnolds! Please.

432
00:46:21,285 --> 00:46:23,285
You know he didn't mean
to attack you.

433
00:46:23,287 --> 00:46:25,219
You don't understand.

434
00:46:25,221 --> 00:46:28,391
It... it isn't Charlie, it's
something else. Something...

435
00:46:28,393 --> 00:46:30,994
I think it's trying to pull us
apart so it can...

436
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,061
Can what?

437
00:46:33,063 --> 00:46:36,532
I think it's trying to kill
my son.

438
00:46:36,534 --> 00:46:39,970
Mrs. Morgan, no one is trying
to kill your son.

439
00:46:39,972 --> 00:46:41,571
Your husband...

440
00:46:41,573 --> 00:46:44,875
My husband was trying to protect
us and you got him locked up!

441
00:46:44,877 --> 00:46:47,243
Last night, Emily butchered
our dog...

442
00:46:47,245 --> 00:46:50,881
with a pair of garden shears,
in her sleep, for God sake!

443
00:46:50,883 --> 00:46:54,318
I saw something lift my son's
bed off the ground.

444
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,822
I need my husband.
I need my husband back!

445
00:46:57,824 --> 00:47:01,860
You said you would help us!

446
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:05,434
How could you do this to us?

447
00:48:52,249 --> 00:48:54,549
You know, that night
in the ward. I can't...

448
00:48:54,551 --> 00:48:56,420
I can't explain it.

449
00:48:57,988 --> 00:49:00,558
There was something in the room
with us.

450
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:05,263
I had to stop it. I'm sorry.

451
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:11,233
You know, people all over the
world, they describe the same...

452
00:49:11,235 --> 00:49:14,603
dark presence during sleep
paralysis episodes.

453
00:49:14,605 --> 00:49:17,473
We write it off as hypnagogic
hallucinations, but...

454
00:49:17,475 --> 00:49:21,479
I knew it wanted Daniel and it
sure as shit wasn't no dream.

455
00:49:51,145 --> 00:49:52,981
I hate you!

456
00:50:00,788 --> 00:50:03,058
I hate you. I hate you.

457
00:50:11,434 --> 00:50:12,402
Emily?

458
00:50:14,503 --> 00:50:17,038
Emily?

459
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:31,457
Oh, no, oh, God... Sarah.

460
00:50:38,496 --> 00:50:40,332
- It's steak.
- Oh...

461
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:43,167
Agh!

462
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Sarah! Sarah, wake up!
Sarah, it's me.
- Hey! Help me, please.
- Daniel.
Daniel! Daniel! Daniel!

463
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:57,481
Help me! Daniel! Get in here.

464
00:50:57,483 --> 00:50:59,353
Daniel! Daniel!

465
00:51:03,858 --> 00:51:05,794
Is he... okay?

466
00:51:08,595 --> 00:51:09,761
Wake him up! Wake him up!

467
00:51:09,763 --> 00:51:12,401
Daniel, wake up!
Wake up, Daniel!

468
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,523
<i>Dream, dream,
dream, dream, dream.</i>

469
00:51:39,295 --> 00:51:40,862
Alice?

470
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,299
Hm.

471
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:46,801
Alice?

472
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,238
Honey?

473
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,307
Alice?

474
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:52,478
Oh...

475
00:52:08,861 --> 00:52:13,165
I'm sorry. How's Daniel?

476
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:18,372
He's fine... for now.

477
00:52:22,742 --> 00:52:26,447
Look, erm, we can't go
to the hospital.

478
00:52:28,182 --> 00:52:29,450
What can we do?

479
00:52:31,852 --> 00:52:34,122
I don't know.

480
00:53:11,629 --> 00:53:12,931
He's gotta be here.

481
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,633
Cam?

482
00:53:16,635 --> 00:53:19,639
Cam, it's Alice.

483
00:53:21,273 --> 00:53:23,742
It's Dr. Arnolds, from the
hospital.

484
00:53:30,482 --> 00:53:32,250
Cam?

485
00:53:32,252 --> 00:53:33,351
Alice.

486
00:53:33,353 --> 00:53:35,322
Alice, how did you...

487
00:53:37,623 --> 00:53:39,590
I'm... I'm sorry, I can't help
you. Please, you gotta go.

488
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:43,294
- Just leave.
- My son's life is in danger!

489
00:53:43,296 --> 00:53:44,796
Please.

490
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:48,633
You're not gonna like
what I have to say.

491
00:53:48,635 --> 00:53:51,404
Go back home and distance
ourself from this family.

492
00:53:51,406 --> 00:53:55,808
And, I'm afraid your son
is going to die.

493
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,442
- There is nothing you can do.
- What, that's it?

494
00:53:57,444 --> 00:53:59,444
Yes. Now, I'm sorry,
you gotta go.

495
00:53:59,446 --> 00:54:00,779
I'm not going anywhere!

496
00:54:00,781 --> 00:54:02,547
Leave now!

497
00:54:02,549 --> 00:54:04,717
Cam, don't make me call
the cops on you...

498
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:07,054
for stealing tranquilizers
from the hospital.

499
00:54:10,358 --> 00:54:13,360
Grandpa? Okay... just a minute.

500
00:54:13,362 --> 00:54:16,297
Hey, just go back to sleep,
okay. Shh... no.

501
00:54:16,299 --> 00:54:17,868
These guys are just leaving.

502
00:54:22,571 --> 00:54:23,840
It's okay.

503
00:54:30,014 --> 00:54:33,648
My grandfather is fine,
Dr. Arnolds.

504
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:36,318
It's just that those drugs...

505
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,089
they're the only way he can
get to sleep.

506
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:42,825
Your son has always suffered
from sleep talking...

507
00:54:42,827 --> 00:54:44,660
and sleepwalking? Hm?

508
00:54:44,662 --> 00:54:46,395
Yes.

509
00:54:46,397 --> 00:54:51,569
That's how the wretched thing
found him.

510
00:54:51,571 --> 00:54:54,838
It seeks out children who are
neither asleep, nor awake.

511
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,543
For it does not exist in the
'real' world...

512
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:02,981
or in the 'dream' world, but in
the cracks in between.

513
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:04,917
- Well, what is it?
- Grandpa, please.

514
00:55:04,919 --> 00:55:06,785
Ah!

515
00:55:06,787 --> 00:55:10,689
It's got many names: the Ancient
Greek's called it mora...

516
00:55:10,691 --> 00:55:14,660
the Persian's bakhtak.

517
00:55:14,662 --> 00:55:17,563
The Japanese kannashibari.

518
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:21,134
I first heard it called
ocnitsa.

519
00:55:21,136 --> 00:55:22,534
In English...

520
00:55:22,536 --> 00:55:24,371
The Night Hag.

521
00:55:24,373 --> 00:55:25,804
Yeah.

522
00:55:25,806 --> 00:55:29,642
In Olde English, the night-mare.

523
00:55:29,644 --> 00:55:34,985
A demon that has existed since
man first learned to dream.

524
00:55:36,952 --> 00:55:39,620
It doesn't exist, they kept
telling me.

525
00:55:39,622 --> 00:55:42,592
Just in your imagination.

526
00:55:44,995 --> 00:55:48,433
Once a child is chosen...

527
00:55:50,802 --> 00:55:54,070
then it paralyzes the child...

528
00:55:54,072 --> 00:55:56,374
in its sleep before crushing it.

529
00:55:57,876 --> 00:56:01,447
And then, when it's finished
feasting...

530
00:56:05,017 --> 00:56:06,685
What?!

531
00:56:14,593 --> 00:56:17,128
- It happened to me.
- Okay, that's enough.

532
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,463
Alice, please, I beg you,
just leave him alone.

533
00:56:19,465 --> 00:56:21,699
How did you survive then?

534
00:56:21,701 --> 00:56:24,769
Another child died in my place.

535
00:56:24,771 --> 00:56:30,008
I don't know how...
I don't know why.

536
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:34,515
I've spent my whole life
trying to understand.

537
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:38,784
But the only thing
I've learned...

538
00:56:38,786 --> 00:56:41,822
is that there are no answers.

539
00:56:41,824 --> 00:56:45,461
There is no help
for your son.

540
00:56:48,063 --> 00:56:49,762
Charlie, look at me.

541
00:56:49,764 --> 00:56:51,698
Nothing is going to happen
to Daniel.

542
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,868
We're gonna do everything
we can. We'll keep him awake.

543
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:57,638
Whatever we have to do.
There are always answers.

544
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:03,047
I like you. I, too, was once
fierce.

545
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:08,553
Then I got old. Life's a bitch.

546
00:57:10,254 --> 00:57:12,524
Life's a b...

547
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,959
Hello.

548
00:57:55,069 --> 00:57:57,906
- Are the salts working?
- So far, but he's fading.

549
00:58:03,077 --> 00:58:06,246
- We should not be here, Grandpa.
- Hello.

550
00:58:06,248 --> 00:58:08,217
- Here, sweetheart.
- Hi.

551
00:58:12,721 --> 00:58:16,593
Okay, the oxygen should keep him
awake for a little while.

552
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:21,662
By now, the thing that
is attacking your son...

553
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:25,232
doesn't care whether it's day
or night.

554
00:58:25,234 --> 00:58:28,003
It knows he's weak.

555
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:31,510
And when he sleeps,
it will come.

556
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,012
We will find a solution,
but until we do...

557
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,617
we all need to stay by him
and keep him awake.

558
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:43,019
Be strong for your son.
You can do that.

559
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:44,289
Thank you, Alice.

560
00:59:32,775 --> 00:59:37,213
I used to sleepwalk a lot
when I was boy, too.

561
00:59:38,948 --> 00:59:44,285
It was while I was asleep
that I first saw it.

562
00:59:44,287 --> 00:59:49,658
A kind old woman who would sing
that lullaby.

563
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:54,262
Come, she said, let's play
a game.

564
00:59:54,264 --> 00:59:57,999
That's how it got close to me.

565
00:59:58,001 --> 00:59:59,769
But then it all changed...

566
00:59:59,771 --> 01:00:01,103
when I first saw it
for what it really was.

567
01:00:01,105 --> 01:00:02,805
Grandpa, stop it.

568
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:06,942
Tell me, tell me, have you all
been sleepwalking?

569
01:00:06,944 --> 01:00:08,712
Nightmares?

570
01:00:08,714 --> 01:00:10,149
The horse.

571
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:16,086
The horse with the white eyes.
I hate it.

572
01:00:16,088 --> 01:00:19,023
Nightmares, sleepwalking...

573
01:00:19,025 --> 01:00:21,759
the same thing happened
to my family.

574
01:00:21,761 --> 01:00:25,195
I believe this parasite infects
your dreams.

575
01:00:25,197 --> 01:00:28,933
It knew my family's darkest
fears...

576
01:00:28,935 --> 01:00:34,138
and used their nightmares to
distract them away from me...

577
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:37,144
allowing it to feed on me,
undisturbed.

578
01:00:39,281 --> 01:00:41,313
Except for my sister.

579
01:00:41,315 --> 01:00:45,485
She was somehow able to save me
from it.

580
01:00:45,487 --> 01:00:49,025
Then she paid with her own life.

581
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Daniel, wake up!
- Get him to the bathroom!
- Dan, wake up!
You can wake'm in the bathroom
in the cold water, come on!

582
01:01:01,037 --> 01:01:02,072
Wake up!

583
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,279
Talk to me. Talk to me.
Tell me your name.

584
01:01:12,281 --> 01:01:13,514
- Come on.
- Charlie, get my medical bag.

585
01:01:13,516 --> 01:01:15,418
- I'm not leaving him.
- Charlie, now!

586
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:18,019
Dan, say something! We can't
keep him like this, Alice!

587
01:01:18,021 --> 01:01:20,222
I know. This will keep you up.
Talk to me, Daniel!

588
01:01:20,224 --> 01:01:21,826
Please, Daniel!

589
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Get him up!
Do something!

590
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:40,878
- Oh, my God.
- Here we go.

591
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,885
Okay. Okay. Okay.

592
01:01:48,155 --> 01:01:50,324
I'm sorry.

593
01:01:56,464 --> 01:02:00,064
How long will the adrenaline
keep him awake for?

594
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:02,370
I'm not sure, maybe a couple
hours.

595
01:02:05,174 --> 01:02:07,409
Can we give him more
if we need to?

596
01:02:11,012 --> 01:02:12,514
His pulse is too high.

597
01:02:23,892 --> 01:02:25,026
<i>Tom?</i>

598
01:02:25,028 --> 01:02:27,529
Mom, where are you? I miss you.

599
01:02:27,531 --> 01:02:30,833
Oh, honey, I'm just...
I'm busy helping someone.

600
01:02:30,835 --> 01:02:32,601
<i>Is Daddy there?</i>

601
01:02:32,603 --> 01:02:36,471
Daddy's in the lounge,
talking to Malcolm.

602
01:02:36,473 --> 01:02:38,841
<i>I heard them
say you're trying to save...</i>

603
01:02:38,843 --> 01:02:42,211
<i>your brother... I thought your
brother was dead?</i>

604
01:02:42,213 --> 01:02:47,182
Just tell Daddy that, erm,
that everything's fine, okay?

605
01:02:47,184 --> 01:02:48,417
- <i>Okay, Mom...</i>
- Okay.

606
01:02:48,419 --> 01:02:50,386
<i>but please come home soon.</i>

607
01:02:50,388 --> 01:02:52,491
<i>I didn't sleep very well last
night without you here.</i>

608
01:02:54,926 --> 01:02:56,960
I'll be home very soon,
I promise.

609
01:02:56,962 --> 01:02:59,362
Okay. Bye. I love you.

610
01:02:59,364 --> 01:03:00,966
<i>I love you, too.</i>

611
01:03:17,384 --> 01:03:23,089
Sweet red chili flavor...

612
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:25,324
they're good.

613
01:03:25,326 --> 01:03:27,063
I'm okay.

614
01:03:30,532 --> 01:03:33,133
I understand that you want
to help...

615
01:03:33,135 --> 01:03:35,269
but you should go home
to your family.

616
01:03:35,271 --> 01:03:37,403
There's nothing more for you
to do.

617
01:03:37,405 --> 01:03:41,442
Do not lose sight of what's
important.

618
01:03:41,444 --> 01:03:43,410
Saving that boy is important.

619
01:03:43,412 --> 01:03:45,480
Saving him is impossible.

620
01:03:45,482 --> 01:03:48,116
What you can do is save
yourself.

621
01:03:48,118 --> 01:03:50,288
Don't make the same mistake
as me.

622
01:03:52,188 --> 01:03:54,956
It drove me to obsession.

623
01:03:54,958 --> 01:04:00,228
I was so scared, I couldn't
sleep for years.

624
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:05,200
It's crazy what a person
will do to stay awake.

625
01:04:05,202 --> 01:04:08,305
I tried to cut my eyelids off.

626
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:09,542
Oh, God.

627
01:04:12,377 --> 01:04:15,182
Come on, Grandpa, we should go.

628
01:04:17,183 --> 01:04:22,219
You know, I really thought
that you might find an answer.

629
01:04:22,221 --> 01:04:25,088
When you're fixated
on something...

630
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:28,660
it's as if you're sleepwalking.

631
01:04:28,662 --> 01:04:30,963
Time to wake up.

632
01:04:30,965 --> 01:04:36,234
Amado... do you think that your
sister was sleepwalking...

633
01:04:36,236 --> 01:04:37,405
when she saved you?

634
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:55,722
Hey, energy drink.

635
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:57,226
Hey, psst...

636
01:04:59,294 --> 01:05:00,530
You drink this.

637
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,172
One more.

638
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:11,942
Hey, good boy.

639
01:05:22,653 --> 01:05:26,021
Hey, you remember Christmas
a couple of years back?

640
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:28,424
Grandma's house?

641
01:05:28,426 --> 01:05:31,027
It snowed hard all
Christmas Eve.

642
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:33,629
You were so excited about all
your presents...

643
01:05:33,631 --> 01:05:35,765
you couldn't sleep.

644
01:05:35,767 --> 01:05:38,972
You came to sleep
with Mom and me.

645
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:44,441
You just sat there all night,
at the end of the bed.

646
01:05:44,443 --> 01:05:48,715
Your eyes wide open.

647
01:05:50,618 --> 01:05:52,220
Remember?

648
01:05:53,821 --> 01:05:56,290
Do you remember that?

649
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:03,463
So we know this thing pushes
us away from Daniel...

650
01:06:03,465 --> 01:06:05,664
when it's feeding, right?

651
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:10,503
So what if we could get back
to Daniel to protect him?

652
01:06:10,505 --> 01:06:13,239
We've been with him before,
we can't stop it.

653
01:06:13,241 --> 01:06:15,341
Yes, but we were awake.

654
01:06:15,343 --> 01:06:18,782
What if we could protect Daniel
while we're asleep?

655
01:06:21,617 --> 01:06:24,551
I know, just follow me.

656
01:06:24,553 --> 01:06:27,288
My brother saw "it" when
he was sleepwalking.

657
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:29,157
You, Charlie, saw something
at the hospital...

658
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:30,424
when you were sleepwalking.

659
01:06:30,426 --> 01:06:33,128
Amado's sister not
only saw it...

660
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:35,429
but she could stop it while
she was sleepwalking.

661
01:06:35,431 --> 01:06:37,465
My sister died.

662
01:06:37,467 --> 01:06:39,769
We're not children, and there's
more than one of us...

663
01:06:39,771 --> 01:06:42,370
so maybe if we can see it,
we can stop it.

664
01:06:42,372 --> 01:06:45,541
Fucking nuts!

665
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:49,680
You're asking me to protect
my son when I'm asleep!

666
01:06:51,183 --> 01:06:54,384
Charlie, we have to do
something.

667
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:56,587
Daniel is exhausted and I cannot
give him any more medication.

668
01:06:56,589 --> 01:06:58,455
He'll be asleep soon.

669
01:06:58,457 --> 01:07:02,392
And there's nothing we can do to
stop it, this is our only shot.

670
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:04,461
We'll know what to expect
this time.

671
01:07:04,463 --> 01:07:07,164
We won't let it push us away.

672
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:09,700
All right.

673
01:07:09,702 --> 01:07:12,305
But how am I going to get
to sleep?

674
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,712
It's heavy stuff.

675
01:07:24,518 --> 01:07:26,355
It's just for tonight.

676
01:07:27,556 --> 01:07:30,860
So, who's driving, you or me?

677
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:34,697
Okay.

678
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:51,416
It's okay, she's safe now.

679
01:08:35,562 --> 01:08:38,431
It's done, Sarah. Give me
your arm, Charlie.

680
01:08:38,433 --> 01:08:44,270
Oh, the demon will use our
nightmares against us...

681
01:08:44,272 --> 01:08:47,405
to draw us away from him.

682
01:08:47,407 --> 01:08:51,678
Do not believe your
surroundings.

683
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:58,188
Return to this room.
Return to Daniel.

684
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,935
If I fall asleep, will I die?

685
01:09:13,937 --> 01:09:18,707
No, honey, I know you're scared.
I am, too...

686
01:09:18,709 --> 01:09:21,342
but we're going to get through
this together, all right?

687
01:09:21,344 --> 01:09:23,746
Let me test you. This will keep
you awake, okay?

688
01:09:23,748 --> 01:09:26,318
What's... what's... what's three
times five?

689
01:09:27,919 --> 01:09:29,718
Fifteen.

690
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:35,260
Fifteen, good, and, erm...
what's four times five?

691
01:09:37,461 --> 01:09:40,031
Twe... twenty.

692
01:09:40,033 --> 01:09:43,534
All right, stay with me, honey.
What's six times eight?

693
01:09:43,536 --> 01:09:45,568
Six times...

694
01:09:55,783 --> 01:09:59,820
Daniel? Daniel? Daniel?

695
01:10:05,026 --> 01:10:08,927
Amado, are you awake?

696
01:10:08,929 --> 01:10:10,833
Nothing's happening to me.

697
01:10:12,733 --> 01:10:15,468
Why is no one sleepwalking?

698
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:16,637
Daniel?

699
01:10:22,411 --> 01:10:23,843
Daniel?

700
01:10:33,989 --> 01:10:35,859
Daniel?

701
01:10:46,904 --> 01:10:48,536
Daniel?

702
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Daniel?

703
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,595
Peter.

704
01:11:11,764 --> 01:11:17,835
Hey, Peter. Hello.

705
01:11:17,837 --> 01:11:21,076
Hey. Come here.

706
01:11:23,743 --> 01:11:25,112
Hello.

707
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:33,889
Why would you say that
about my teeth? I...

708
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

709
01:12:02,187 --> 01:12:03,686
It's not real.

710
01:12:03,688 --> 01:12:05,691
Help me, Alice! Please!

711
01:12:07,925 --> 01:12:09,057
I can't help you.

712
01:12:09,059 --> 01:12:11,397
You can, Alice. Please!

713
01:12:21,573 --> 01:12:23,973
Remember where you are!

714
01:12:23,975 --> 01:12:25,545
Come back!

715
01:12:27,047 --> 01:12:28,949
Come back to Daniel!

716
01:12:31,584 --> 01:12:33,186
Daniel.

717
01:12:40,594 --> 01:12:42,126
Help me, Alice! Please!

718
01:12:42,128 --> 01:12:44,162
I can't help you.
You're not my brother.

719
01:12:44,164 --> 01:12:45,898
- Alice!
- No, my brother's dead.

720
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,032
Help!

721
01:12:47,034 --> 01:12:48,567
It's Daniel...

722
01:12:50,738 --> 01:12:53,006
Agh! Agh!

723
01:13:07,523 --> 01:13:09,624
Peter.

724
01:13:09,626 --> 01:13:15,667
Oh, no, no! Peter! Peter!

725
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:30,516
Please!

726
01:13:36,253 --> 01:13:39,155
- Liam!
- Alice, help me! Alice!

727
01:13:39,157 --> 01:13:40,227
Liam!

728
01:13:41,259 --> 01:13:44,063
Agh! Agh! Agh!

729
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:50,071
Peter!

730
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,940
Liam! No!

731
01:13:54,942 --> 01:13:56,777
Please, Alice!

732
01:14:00,147 --> 01:14:04,784
Finish what you started!

733
01:14:04,786 --> 01:14:06,922
- Alice!
- Liam!

734
01:14:15,230 --> 01:14:19,736
Oh, I've got you.

735
01:14:24,806 --> 01:14:26,142
I've got you.

736
01:14:51,103 --> 01:14:53,973
My brother is dead!

737
01:15:15,262 --> 01:15:16,831
Amado?

738
01:15:21,968 --> 01:15:23,637
Amado?

739
01:15:24,771 --> 01:15:26,838
Amado?

740
01:15:52,402 --> 01:15:54,171
Amado?

741
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Finish what I started.

742
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,704
I'm sorry.

743
01:16:56,837 --> 01:16:59,307
You did the right thing.

744
01:17:01,843 --> 01:17:07,750
Finally, I can get some
real sleep.

745
01:19:12,218 --> 01:19:13,485
Hello.

746
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:14,919
<i>Mom?</i>

747
01:19:14,921 --> 01:19:17,222
Hi! How are you, my little
artist?

748
01:19:17,224 --> 01:19:20,257
<i>I'm retired now. Wanna play?</i>

749
01:19:20,259 --> 01:19:23,962
- Yes. One, two, three.
- <i>One, two, three.</i>

750
01:19:23,964 --> 01:19:26,031
- <i>No, that's not fair!</i>
- I won!

751
01:19:26,033 --> 01:19:28,566
- <i>You cheated.</i>
- I did not cheat!

752
01:19:28,568 --> 01:19:29,968
Who's the loser now?

753
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:32,004
- <i>Best out of three.</i>
- Okay.

754
01:19:32,006 --> 01:19:33,571
<i>Okay, sweetie, that's enough.</i>

755
01:19:33,573 --> 01:19:35,540
<i>Look, erm, Mom and Dad need
to talk now, okay?</i>

756
01:19:35,542 --> 01:19:37,075
- <i>One minute only.</i>
- <i>Okay, okay.</i>

757
01:19:37,077 --> 01:19:38,612
- <i>One minute.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

758
01:19:38,614 --> 01:19:40,147
I love you.

759
01:19:40,149 --> 01:19:41,950
<i>Love you, too.</i>

760
01:19:44,019 --> 01:19:45,318
<i>Hey.</i>

761
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,688
How is she?

762
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:50,658
<i>Apart from her hamster dying
last night...</i>

763
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:53,560
<i>she's, erm, she's fine.</i>

764
01:19:53,562 --> 01:19:55,462
Oh, that's awful.

765
01:19:55,464 --> 01:19:56,730
<i>How are you?</i>

766
01:19:56,732 --> 01:19:59,266
I'm really good, actually.

767
01:19:59,268 --> 01:20:01,101
- Rested.
- <i>Wow.</i>

768
01:20:01,103 --> 01:20:03,404
Feeling better, better than I've
been in years.

769
01:20:03,406 --> 01:20:06,240
<i>I don't think that either of us
have, er...</i>

770
01:20:06,242 --> 01:20:08,177
<i>slept well since this whole
thing happened.</i>

771
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:10,712
I know. Tom...

772
01:20:10,714 --> 01:20:15,118
this has been so rough on the
two of you and I'm so sorry.

773
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,020
All my priorities were
messed up.

774
01:20:17,022 --> 01:20:20,123
<i>Yeah, I know,
it's erm, it's okay.</i>

775
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:23,392
I promise from now on, you two
are my first priority.

776
01:20:23,394 --> 01:20:25,027
No more obsessing over work.

777
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:30,668
No.

778
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:34,205
<i>Alice? What's wrong, honey?</i>

779
01:20:34,207 --> 01:20:36,406
No. Tom, that lullaby,
where did she hear that?!

780
01:20:36,408 --> 01:20:38,042
<i>Honey, calm down. We're okay.</i>

781
01:20:38,044 --> 01:20:39,577
- Where did she hear it?
- <i>Mom?</i>

782
01:20:39,579 --> 01:20:41,145
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

783
01:20:41,147 --> 01:20:42,714
- <i>What are you...?</i>
- Where did she hear it?

784
01:20:42,716 --> 01:20:44,248
<i>Look, please, just calm down!</i>

785
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:45,617
- Alice?
- <i>Mom?</i>

786
01:20:45,619 --> 01:20:47,486
<i>We're fine. Everything is fine.</i>

787
01:20:47,488 --> 01:20:49,086
- No, it's not okay!
- <i>Just relax.</i>

788
01:20:49,088 --> 01:20:50,422
- Please listen to me.
- <i>Okay, Niamh! Niamh!</i>

789
01:20:50,424 --> 01:20:52,124
- Tom? Please!
- <i>You're upsetting Niamh!</i>

790
01:20:52,126 --> 01:20:53,760
- I wanna talk to my husband!
- <i>Please just...</i>

791
01:20:53,762 --> 01:20:55,261
- Tom?
- <i>Mom!</i>

792
01:20:55,263 --> 01:20:56,796
- Tom!
- <i>I... I can't do this anymore!</i>

793
01:20:56,798 --> 01:20:58,431
