about the bond measure.

have to see it again.

what I did might
make her wanna hurt us.

you have to tell me.

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,433
- Is he all right?
- He's sick.

360
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,317
How sick?

361
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,278
Max,

362
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,237
I need your help.

363
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,993
Here.

364
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,036
I'll get some more blankets.

365
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,953
The house is yours if there's
anything you need at all.

366
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,156
[Rachel] OK. Thanks.

367
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,878
- Here.
- Thank you.

368
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,758
- Shouldn't he be at a hospital?
- No, he's fine.

369
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,034
The bath?

370
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,714
Just down the hall.
I'll get it started.

371
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,518
Honey.

372
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,549
I'm gonna go home
and get some of our things.

373
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,318
Then we'll leave here
and never come back, OK?

374
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,912
[Rachel] Let's get you warmed up.

375
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,594
Not the best water pressure,
but it works.

376
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,319
It's good, thanks.
I don't know why we lost power.

377
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,594
The block seemed fine.

378
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,558
I have plenty of candles
in case the problem spreads.

379
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,596
Go ahead and get in.
Get you warmed up.

380
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,114
Max, I just need
to go back to my house,

381
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,316
get a few things,
some medicine.

382
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,197
Do you mind if you could?

383
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,589
- I'll watch him. Of course.
- OK, thanks.

384
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,399
Honey, go ahead and get in.
Let's go. Let's go.

385
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,798
We need to raise your temperature.
Now, let's get in.

386
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,917
Aidan, what's wrong?
It's just water.

387
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,356
- We need to raise your temperature...
- I don't want to, Rachel.

388
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,715
Do you want me
to get in with you?

389
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,475
Let's go then.
Aidan. Come on, let's go.

390
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,157
That's it.

391
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,118
Come on, honey.
Let's go. Let's go.

392
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,395
That's it. That's it.

393
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,351
That's better, right?

394
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,069
See? It's nice and warm.

395
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,550
It's OK. Just relax.

396
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,953
[Wailing]

397
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,230
[Water pouring]

398
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,436
[Phone ringing]

399
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,278
[Max] Hello?

400
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,636
Officer Ray. How you doing?

401
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,156
Yeah, good, good. All right,
what do you got for me?

402
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,993
Mm-hmm. Right.

403
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,196
Yeah. Yeah.

404
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,352
Yeah, well, that all
sounds like page 26.

405
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,510
You don't have any headlines?

406
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,397
No?

407
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,710
Well, business is business.

408
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,031
Yeah. No, no, I'm good.
Real good.

409
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,714
Could you do me a little favour
while I've got you?

410
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,075
Could you look into
your accident reports

411
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,197
and see if there was an accident
with a woman and her son?

412
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,316
"K" for Keller.

413
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,868
No, no, I'm just trying
to get a story straight.

414
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,837
[Door squeaks shut]

415
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,353
Ray?

416
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,000
Ray, let me call you right back. OK.

417
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,678
[Knocking]

418
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,399
Everything OK in there?

419
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,790
Uh, Aidan, could you, uh,
unlock the door, please?

420
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,111
[Knocking] Aidan, can you hear me?

421
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,196
Aidan, please, unlock the door!

422
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,554
Aidan, open the door!

423
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,590
Aidan. Aidan. Aidan!

424
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,035
He's in the bath.
It was open a second ago.

425
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,078
- Aidan, open the door!
- I'll get something to break it.

426
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,913
Aidan, open up the door.
I'm right here.

427
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,036
Honey, can you hear me? Please.

428
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,111
You need to open up the door.

429
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,713
Aidan!

430
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,431
Aidan.

431
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,958
Oh, my God.

432
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,994
Aidan!

433
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,308
Aidan.

434
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,709
Please, honey, open the...

435
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,396
Oh, my God.

436
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,392
Oh!

437
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,277
Aidan.

438
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,392
Aidan. Aidan.

439
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,677
Look at me. Aidan, look at me.
Look at me.

440
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
[Coughing]

441
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,714
Mommy!

442
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,358
[Shrieks]

443
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,430
[Max] Rachel, no!

444
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,234
[Coughing]

445
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,356
Baby. Oh.

446
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,112
Oh, my God.
Baby, I'm sorry.

447
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,117
It wasn't him. It wasn't him.

448
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,872
I was just trying to help.

449
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,748
OK, Rachel, let's just
get him out of there.

450
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,918
Why is she doing this to me?

451
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,353
I'm here now, baby.

452
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,318
- Why is she doing this to me?
- It's OK, Aidan.

453
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,994
- We're gonna get you to a hospital.
- No!

454
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,116
- They can't do anything.
- [Coughing]

455
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,430
You asked for help,
you're gonna get help.

456
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,238
He gets to a hospital. Now.

457
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,673
[Crying]

458
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,239
[Man] We're working to raise
his core temperature.

459
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,197
He was at 90 degrees
when he came in.

460
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,479
- He wasn't outside overnight?
- No. He was at home with me.

461
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,757
A body doesn't develop
severe hypothermia on its own.

462
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,594
Whatever the cause, he's fighting it.
Seems like he's stabilizing.

463
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,036
- And he's just sleeping now?
- Right.

464
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,873
And having some kind of dream.

465
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,674
What's the story, Rachel?

466
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,156
They stabilized his temperature.

467
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,549
I mean the story
with you and Aidan.

468
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,676
You seem awfully hard on him.

469
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,999
Look, I know
it's a stressful time for you.

470
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,231
Moving. It's a whole new life.

471
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,118
Maybe you should tell me.

472
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,677
All I ever tried to do for him
was the right thing,

473
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,149
and it only ever
made things worse.

474
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,357
Then it wasn't
the right thing, was it?

475
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,635
[Rachel] What do you see?

476
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,311
Well, it's Aidan.

477
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,315
- Is that a girl there?
- Why is she in the picture?

478
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,233
- Why? How would I know?
- Why is she in all of them?

479
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,110
Her name's Samara.

480
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,718
She was murdered by her mother.
Left to die at the bottom of a well.

481
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,071
- Wait, she's... she's who?
- She didn't die.

482
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,756
At least, not her ghost.
I kept it alive for Aidan.

483
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,832
I let it out,
it spread and then we ran.

484
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,879
- What are you talking about?
- I know this sounds crazy,

485
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,238
but she's here now.
She's found us.

486
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,356
And I thought it was
just to hurt Aidan,

487
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,035
but it's more than that.
She wants to be him.

488
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,635
And she wants to live
for real this time.

489
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,639
You tell me, who can help me?

490
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,198
- Who?
- I'm sure there's a rational...

491
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,794
You take his picture
and tell me why she's in it.

492
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,075
- Rachel.
- You take his picture.

493
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,709
It's proof that he's what?
He's got a ghost inside him?

494
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,588
No. The proof
is what will happen.

495
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,035
[Rachel] Aidan,

496
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:12,079
you said Samara
couldn't hear us when we sleep.

497
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,788
Well, you're sleeping now.

498
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,233
Tell me how to stop her, honey.

499
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,271
Tell me how to help you.

500
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,318
Just tell me,
I'll do anything, I swear.

Aidan?

511
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,640
- Aidan?
- Miss Keller?

512
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,593
Hello, I'm Dr Emma Temple.

513
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,753
I'm a consulting physician
at County Child Services.

514
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,673
Well, I was hoping to speak
with Aidan when he wakes up.

515
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,074
Is everything all right in here?

516
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,549
Yeah. It's fine. Thank you.

517
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,234
[Dr Temple] I was hoping
to speak with you as well.

518
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:09,269
It's Rachel, isn't it?
Yeah, about his situation.

519
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,670
[Rachel] Sorry, what kind
of doctor did you say you were again?

520
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,159
I'm a psychiatrist.

521
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,155
Yeah. I spoke with a Dr, um...

522
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,959
...Koji in Seattle. Aidan's doctor.

523
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,474
Look, if we could
maybe talk later.

524
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,873
Right. Um, Dr Koji mentioned
that you dealt with some PPD

525
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,030
when Aidan was born.

526
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,553
Postpartum depression.

527
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,631
That was the first month.
That's all.

528
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,995
I understand. It's very common.

529
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,198
I mean, a lot of women have trouble
adapting to the stresses of motherhood.

530
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,671
What does this have to do with
what's going on with my son right now?

531
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,070
Have you been
under stress lately?

532
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,596
Have you ever found that you were...

533
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,877
...unable to experience love for Aidan?

534
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,475
- What?
- Have you hurt him,

535
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,993
however unintentionally?

536
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,719
Have you left him alone?
Abandoned him?

537
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,679
I'd like to be with my son,
please, if you don't mind.

538
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,870
Yeah, of course.

539
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,270
I'm sorry, Rachel.

540
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,271
[Beeping]

541
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,873
Until we can talk further,

542
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,635
I cannot let you be alone with him.

543
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,119
I'm his mother.

544
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,592
There are bruises on his body.

545
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,592
He was hypothermic
and very near death.

546
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,830
That is not because of me.

547
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,674
[Dr Temple] He's gonna
be all right. He will.

548
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,035
But you need to leave.

549
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,315
Now, please.

550
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,071
[Whispering] You can't have him,
Samara.

551
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,789
You're going back
to where you came from.

552
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,477
All I wanna know is what her
history was before the Morgans.

553
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,915
I'm sorry, but the
privacy laws still apply.

554
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,993
Well, was she really adopted?
Can you at least tell me that much?

555
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,311
- Was their story true?
- Samara Morgan was adopted, yes.

556
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,073
But you won't tell me from who?

557
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,357
- I'd lose my job if I did.
- [Sighing] Look, ma'am,

558
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,149
my son has a medical condition
that his doctors don't even understand.

559
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,390
This little girl
had the same condition.

560
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,632
Now, if I knew what caused that,
it could save his life.

561
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,599
[Woman] All I can say is you
should speak to the Morgans.

562
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,434
They're dead.
They both killed themselves.

563
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

564
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,992
Whoa! Look out. Early birds.

565
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,275
Marty Savide,
Stevens Northwest Realty.

566
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,669
- Hi.
- Uh, come in.

567
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,036
I thought I put 12.30 on the ad.
For the open house.

568
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,634
- How'd you get around the gate?
- Well, I just...

569
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,312
Ah! Who cares? Come on.

570
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,154
Make me an offer
over asking and it's yours.

571
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,879
OK, then, don't mind me.

572
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,158
My first try with these things,
took off flying. [chuckling]

573
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,831
There we go.

574
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,751
What do you think?

575
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,753
Um, a little colour will really
turn the place around.

576
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,592
It's got a wonderful history.

577
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,636
Working horse ranch.
How about that?

578
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,430
And there's even this cute little
tree house thing way up in the barn.

579
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,911
Um, is the place being
sold unfurnished or?

580
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,594
The previous owners
didn't leave anything behind?

581
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:26,038
Well, there were some things
that were left, after they...

582
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,269
...moved.

583
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,794
We're storing all that
in the basement.

584
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,871
There's a basement?

585
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,953
Uh... Well, you betcha.
No extra charge.

586
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,996
Right this way.

587
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:44,075
[Low rumbling]

588
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,233
[Savide] Uh, if you don't mind,
I'm the welcome wagon.

589
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,276
Gotta open up the gate for everyone.

590
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,396
So please,
just make yourself at home.

591
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,792
Do you know what happened
to them? The previous owners?

592
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,030
I believe they bought
a condo in Phoenix.

593
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,394
Really?

594
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,598

[Gasps]

598
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,310
I'll take it from here.

599
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,876
Hello, Aidan, I'm Dr Temple.

600
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,359
How are you feeling?

601
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,596
Aidan?

602
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,875
You know,
I'd really like to help you.

603
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,077
Can you tell me
how you're feeling?

604
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,752
Where's my mommy?

605
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,913
Well, she'll be here soon.
She's on her way.

606
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,514
I want Mommy.

607
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,477
Yeah, I know you do.

608
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,755
Your mommy
wants to be with you too.

609
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,479
So where is she?

610
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,198
She went home.

611
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,999
She didn't think that you
were gonna wake up so soon.

612
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,718
I wanna go home too.

613
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,030
Well, you will.

614
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,999
We just have to...
We just have to get you...

615
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,756
You're freezing.

616
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,190
I wanna go home to Mommy.

617
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,670
Well, we need to talk about her.

618
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,558
Can you tell me
about Mommy a little bit?

619
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,719
She loves me.

620
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,756
I know that she does.

621
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:17,277
She went looking for me.
She tried to find me.

622
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,635
It means she loves me.

623
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,597
I don't understand.

624
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,558
Can I go home now?

625
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,199
No, honey,
you're not well enough.

626
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,432
Can I go home?

627
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,633
No.

628
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,350
I'm sorry.

629
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,437
Then I have
to show you something.

630
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,352
It won't stop.

631
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,359
[Exhales]

632
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,196
[Woman] I'm gonna walk you
just around the corner here.

633
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:00,197
Her name was Evelyn.

634
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,669
She came to us
eight months pregnant.

635
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,512
- Did she have her baby here?
- Yes.

636
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,431
And you arranged
for the adoption?

637
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,078
That's right.

638
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,948
- And the father?
- There was none.

639
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,870
Half the mothers
that come to us say that.

640
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,793
So, what did she think
got her pregnant?

641
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,949
Evelyn wasn't well.

642
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,759
She had been having problems
during the pregnancy:

643
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,195
Hallucinations, visions.

644
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,556
She believed some thing
had come for her baby

645
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,995
from the waters of the world
beyond this one.

646
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,230
I'm sorry. Did you say water?

647
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:37,916
Well, we all envision
the afterlife differently.

648
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,755
For Evelyn,
it's just what she believed.

649
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:46,799
As you might imagine, she suffered
severe postpartum depression.

650
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,997
She blamed her troubles
on her child.

651
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,878
So she tried to kill it.

652
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,033
- All babies are a challenge.
- [Baby cooing]

653
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:05,432
But Samara, she never cried.

654
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,351
Never.

655
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,829
Except when her mother
would try to bathe her.

656
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,754
Then she'd scream like it
was the end of the world.

657
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,597
It was the screaming that woke us.

[Woman] She was trying
to drown the baby.

663
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,229
The baby was taken from her,
of course.

664
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,709
Evelyn was institutionalized.

665
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,234
And all those pictures
she'd been collecting,

666
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,357
they finally made sense.

667
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,392
Did she say why she did it?

668
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,870
She felt she had to kill
her baby to save it.

669
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,909
I'm here to see a patient.
Her name's Evelyn.

670
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,560
- I don't know her last name.
- Evelyn?

671
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,676
That's right.

672

Evelyn's expecting you.

sort of have a feeling.

- It has to do with your daughter.

to kill your baby?

till she finds one.

886
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,551
[Aidan] Come on!
Come back!

887
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,915
Get away from her! Rachel!

888
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,956
Get away from her!

889
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:20,392
You can't have my son.

890
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:27,113
So take me.

891
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,713
Rachel! No!

892
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:36,870

Here I am, Samara.

896
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:22,118
Just like you wanted.

897
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:27,596
But you leave him alone!

898
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,318
You hear me?

899
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,629
[Electric buzzing]

900
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,118
[Samara] Help me.

901
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,193
It's always open.

902
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:54,478
Her only way out
is always open.

903
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,871
[Samara muffled] Mommy.

904
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,637
Mommy!

905
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:43,153
Mommy.

[Breathing heavily]

908
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
[Panting, straining]

909
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:36,031
- Mommy!
- I'm not your fucking mommy.

910
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,989
[Gasping]

911
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,631

913
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,237
[Aidan] Rachel.

914
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,797
Rachel.

915
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:19,518
Rachel.

916
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,719
Rachel.

917
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:27,429
- Can you hear me?
- I can hear you.

918
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,875
[Aidan] I'm right here.

919
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:58,992
[Silence]

920
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,195
[Aidan] Rachel.

921
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,916
Rachel!

922
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,871
You're here.

923
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,075
- You're here, Rachel.
- Of course I'm here.

924
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:16,993
I followed your voice.

925
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,797
What happened?

926
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,520
It's over, honey.

927
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:29,074
She's not coming back.

928
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,833
How do you know, Rachel?

929
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,670
I know.

930
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,391
I promise.

931
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,191
I promise.

932
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,794
I love you, Mommy.

933
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:54,155
Promise me something?

934
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:57,710
Yeah. Anything, Mom. Anything.

935
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:00,189
Just call me Rachel.

936
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,438
At least for a while.

937
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,553
[Whirring, hissing]

938
01:40:35,153 --> 01:40:36,711
I wanna show you something.

939
01:40:37,953 --> 01:40:39,671
What?

940
01:40:46,593 --> 01:40:49,346
Have you ever seen
something so scary

941
01:40:49,433 --> 01:40:52,072
that you had to show
to someone else?

942
01:40:54,073 --> 01:40:57,031
I mean, like, you know,
a movie or something.

943
01:40:57,113 --> 01:40:58,751
Well...

944
01:40:58,833 --> 01:41:03,668
I've got the scariest
freakin' movie you'll ever see.

945
01:41:03,753 --> 01:41:07,792
Now... A buddy of mine
actually turned me on to it.

946
01:41:07,873 --> 01:41:09,750
And he made me a copy.

947
01:41:09,833 --> 01:41:12,950
So... I did one for you.

948
01:41:13,033 --> 01:41:14,944
You brought me here
to watch a video?

949
01:41:15,033 --> 01:41:18,628
Well, two minutes. OK?
Two minutes and it'll all be over.

950
01:41:18,713 --> 01:41:21,147
It's totally underground stuff.

951
01:41:21,233 --> 01:41:24,543
- I thought we were gonna just...
- No, we will. We will.

952
01:41:24,633 --> 01:41:28,182
You just gotta see this.
I'm telling you, it's...

953
01:41:28,273 --> 01:41:31,390
- How about after we?
- No, you need to watch it now.

954
01:41:39,393 --> 01:41:41,429
What's so scary about it?

955
01:41:52,713 --> 01:41:54,544
You'll see.

956
01:42:14,233 --> 01:42:17,305
Play it. Just play the thing.

957
01:42:17,393 --> 01:42:20,112
Come on,
I got two minutes here, please.

958
01:43:02,633 --> 01:43:04,942
Emily, play the goddamn tape!

959
01:43:53,113 --> 01:43:55,069
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, man, you made it. </i>

960
01:43:55,153 --> 01:43:58,270
<i>I knew you'd come through. 
You got somebody to watch it</i>

961
01:44:02,633 --> 01:44:05,101
Some stupid chick
from my school.

962
01:44:05,193 --> 01:44:07,946
<i>Good. I was afraid
you didn't believe me, man. </i>

963
01:44:08,033 --> 01:44:11,742
<i>Now it's her problem. She doesn't
get someone else to watch it in a week,</i>

964
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:13,744
<i>I swear she's dead. </i>

965
01:44:13,833 --> 01:44:15,983
<i>So, did you tell her what happens</i>

966
01:44:16,073 --> 01:44:18,462
<i>or you just gonna let her
find out for herself?</i>

967
01:44:20,153 --> 01:44:22,542
<i> Jake?</i>

968
01:44:22,633 --> 01:44:25,147
<i>Come on, it's over, dude. </i>

969
01:44:25,233 --> 01:44:29,146
<i> Jake. This isn't funny, man. </i>

970
01:44:31,673 --> 01:44:33,470
Emily?

971
01:44:55,753 --> 01:44:59,268
- Emily, what the hell did you do?
- I played it, I just didn't look.

972
01:45:53,553 --> 01:45:56,272
Come on, Aidan, let's go home.

973
01:46:47,593 --> 01:46:51,711
It was the right choice.
No question.

974
01:46:57,073 --> 01:47:00,702
Aidan, dinner's ready.

975
01:47:02,753 --> 01:47:05,187
Damn.

976
01:47:23,313 --> 01:47:27,101
OK, now, before you say anything,
I followed the recipe this time.

977
01:47:27,193 --> 01:47:30,151
Just 'cause it doesn't look
like the one in the magazine,

978
01:47:30,233 --> 01:47:33,145
doesn't mean to say
it won't taste good.

979
01:47:36,673 --> 01:47:40,666
Those are great, honey.
Got a really good eye.

980
01:47:46,233 --> 01:47:48,542
He'd be proud of you.

981
01:47:49,273 --> 01:47:51,264
Thanks, Rachel.

982
01:47:54,073 --> 01:47:57,827
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to call me "mom" now and again.

983
01:47:57,913 --> 01:48:00,188
"Ma. " "Mommy. "

984
01:48:00,273 --> 01:48:03,663
Something besides "Rachel".

985
01:48:03,753 --> 01:48:05,505
Yeah, I like "Rachel".

986
01:48:05,593 --> 01:48:08,187
Well, "mom" has its charms too,
you know.

987
01:48:08,273 --> 01:48:10,389
But "Rachel"
is more your personality.

988
01:48:10,473 --> 01:48:11,667
Really?

989
01:48:12,473 --> 01:48:17,183
Well, Rachel declares dinnertime.

990
01:48:23,913 --> 01:48:26,950
It's working out great,
don't you think?

991
01:48:27,033 --> 01:48:30,184
All of this space and fresh air.

992
01:48:30,273 --> 01:48:33,709
We have a yard.
It's really great.

993
01:48:41,993 --> 01:48:44,712
Listen, honey...

994
01:48:48,793 --> 01:48:50,670
...we didn't do anything wrong.

995
01:48:52,393 --> 01:48:55,351
We did what anyone would do.

996
01:48:57,233 --> 01:48:59,793
We started over.

997
01:49:22,033 --> 01:49:25,423
You know how they can tell
you used to work at a real newspaper?

998
01:49:25,513 --> 01:49:27,788
You're the only one
who closes your door.

999
01:49:27,873 --> 01:49:29,943
Habit.

1000
01:49:33,913 --> 01:49:37,144
I wanted to talk
to you about my editorial.

1001
01:49:37,233 --> 01:49:39,349
Those changes OK?

1002
01:49:39,433 --> 01:49:42,823
Well, I asked you to copy edit it
and you rewrote it.

1003
01:49:42,913 --> 01:49:45,029
Just the part
about the bond measure.

1004
01:49:45,113 --> 01:49:46,512
That was the whole thing.

1005
01:49:46,593 --> 01:49:49,312
The bridge would get
the money, not the riverfront.

1006
01:49:55,073 --> 01:49:56,870
You know,
a big news day in Astoria

1007
01:49:56,953 --> 01:50:00,866
is a school board meeting, a car wreck
and a cat in a tree. That's big news.

1008
01:50:00,953 --> 01:50:04,582
You sure this is the job
you're looking for?

1009
01:50:04,673 --> 01:50:07,346
Well, I'm around for my son more.

1010
01:50:07,433 --> 01:50:09,071
In Seattle, I wasn't.

1011
01:50:10,633 --> 01:50:12,464
Good a reason as any.

1012
01:50:12,553 --> 01:50:15,909
I'm glad to see you're
settling in. I like the...

1013
01:50:15,993 --> 01:50:17,392
Max, while you're here,

1014
01:50:17,473 --> 01:50:20,306
have you given any thought
to that piece for tomorrow?

1015
01:50:20,393 --> 01:50:22,270
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

1016
01:50:24,233 --> 01:50:27,384
<i>It's 442 Ridgecrest. </i>

1017
01:50:27,473 --> 01:50:29,623
<i>Repeat that. 
It's what?</i>

1018
01:50:29,713 --> 01:50:32,352
<i>Ridgecrest. Ridgecrest!</i>

1019
01:50:32,433 --> 01:50:35,505

examiner. They're on their way. </i>

1021
01:50:37,473 --> 01:50:39,703
<i>Can we keep
this channel clear?</i>

1022
01:50:39,793 --> 01:50:42,261
- The police found a body.
- Possible homicide.

1023
01:50:42,353 --> 01:50:45,550
- Please, we should be so lucky.
- What are they saying?

1024
01:50:45,633 --> 01:50:50,070
"High school student, male, 17.
Address, 442 Ridgecrest.

1025

Found the house flooded,
a girlfriend hiding in the basement. "

1026
01:50:53,513 --> 01:50:57,472
- Suspect or witness, they don't know.
- The guy was dead in front of the TV.

1027
01:50:57,553 --> 01:51:00,829
They keep on talking
about his face.

1028
01:51:00,913 --> 01:51:03,063
What about his face?

1029
01:51:03,153 --> 01:51:07,066

area Astoria, switch to Tack Five. </i>

1030

Detective.

1031
01:51:24,313 --> 01:51:27,385
Detective, you have a minute?
Was it homicide or wasn't it?

1032
01:51:27,473 --> 01:51:28,986
You know how he died.

1033
01:51:40,793 --> 01:51:42,829
I just have
a few last questions.

1034
01:51:42,913 --> 01:51:45,791
If you could walk me
through it again.

1035
01:52:17,193 --> 01:52:20,265
It's just horrible.
So young.

1036
01:53:09,513 --> 01:53:11,504
No.

1037
01:53:12,553 --> 01:53:16,785
No, please, not here.

1038
01:53:33,353 --> 01:53:34,945
I found you.

1039
01:53:52,673 --> 01:53:55,824
We only made one copy.

1040
01:53:57,513 --> 01:54:00,823
Oh, God.

1041
01:54:07,313 --> 01:54:09,508
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hold on.

1042
01:54:11,113 --> 01:54:14,423
- Rachel Keller from the Daily Astorian.
- We'll make a statement.

1043
01:54:14,513 --> 01:54:17,346
- I need to know about the girl.
- We'll make a statement.

1044
01:54:17,433 --> 01:54:19,230
She hasn't said a word, has she?

1045
01:54:20,033 --> 01:54:23,343
You're welcome to wait.
Excuse me.

1046
01:54:26,233 --> 01:54:28,906
Watch your step.
Have a seat here, OK?

1047
01:54:28,993 --> 01:54:31,826
Have a seat.
I just want you to relax for me.

1048
01:54:31,913 --> 01:54:33,346
You can't keep her.

1049
01:54:33,433 --> 01:54:36,391
- Focus on the walls.
- We wanna take her.

1050
01:54:36,473 --> 01:54:39,067
- She'll talk to us.
- I understand.

1051
01:54:39,153 --> 01:54:41,508
I'm just gonna ask
a few questions. Please.

1052
01:54:41,593 --> 01:54:44,869
- Be right back, Emily.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1053
01:54:44,953 --> 01:54:48,707
All right. Give me his number.
Yeah. All right.

1054
01:55:05,033 --> 01:55:08,992
Emily, listen to me.
I know what happened.

1055
01:55:09,073 --> 01:55:10,586
I know.

1056
01:55:10,673 --> 01:55:13,745
Now, you have to tell me.
The tape.

1057
01:55:17,033 --> 01:55:19,342
Did you watch it?

1058
01:55:21,713 --> 01:55:24,944
Do you know who else
has watched it?

1059
01:55:26,113 --> 01:55:29,583
Has anyone else watched it?

1060
01:55:31,273 --> 01:55:32,501
Then where is it?

1061
01:55:32,593 --> 01:55:36,427
Hey, you.
Get away from her. Ray.

1062
01:55:36,513 --> 01:55:39,869
Emily, talk to me.

1063
01:55:39,953 --> 01:55:41,784
I want her out of here.
Now.

1064
01:55:41,873 --> 01:55:44,467
You can tell me, Emily.

1065
01:58:24,073 --> 01:58:25,904
No.

1066
01:58:26,953 --> 01:58:30,502
Not here, Samara.

1067
01:58:30,593 --> 01:58:32,584
Not here.

1068
02:00:37,033 --> 02:00:38,944
Honey, what is it?

1069
02:00:39,033 --> 02:00:41,228
What's wrong?

1070
02:00:41,313 --> 02:00:43,781
Look at me.

1071
02:00:43,873 --> 02:00:47,183
- OK? What is it?
- I had a nightmare.

1072
02:00:47,273 --> 02:00:51,391
That's all right.
We all have them.

1073
02:00:52,993 --> 02:00:56,190
Oh, God, you're soaked.
And you're freezing.

1074
02:00:56,273 --> 02:00:59,310
Let's get you out of
these clothes. Come on.

1075
02:00:59,393 --> 02:01:00,746
Aidan?

1076
02:01:01,393 --> 02:01:03,827
What happened in your nightmare?

1077
02:01:07,073 --> 02:01:11,464
I woke up and you weren't here.
You weren't here.

1078
02:01:12,873 --> 02:01:16,991
I'm here now, honey.
I'm right here, OK?

1079
02:01:18,793 --> 02:01:20,431
Listen.

1080
02:01:20,513 --> 02:01:24,347
All you have to do is call my
name and I'll follow your voice.

1081
02:01:25,313 --> 02:01:27,781
OK?

1082
02:01:28,673 --> 02:01:32,985
Even if I have to come right down
into that nightmare with you.

1083
02:01:34,273 --> 02:01:36,150
So tell me what happened.

1084
02:01:40,993 --> 02:01:42,346
I don't remember.

1085
02:01:43,233 --> 02:01:44,586
You don't remember?

1086
02:01:45,553 --> 02:01:47,464
I don't remember.

1087
02:02:34,073 --> 02:02:37,190
Honey. You heard me?

1088
02:02:37,273 --> 02:02:39,104
I've been calling your name.

1089
02:02:40,233 --> 02:02:42,383
I'm... sorry.

1090
02:02:44,033 --> 02:02:46,752
You ready to go?

1091
02:02:49,953 --> 02:02:51,671
OK.

1092
02:03:46,953 --> 02:03:49,990
So we'll just swing by
and see what they have, OK?

1093
02:03:50,073 --> 02:03:53,190
And you can keep a watch on
the backyard stuff. How's that?

1094
02:03:57,913 --> 02:04:01,542
Look at all this stuff.
Who do you think buys this crap?

1095
02:04:03,073 --> 02:04:05,109
Rachel.

1096
02:04:05,193 --> 02:04:06,911
Sorry.

1097
02:04:08,633 --> 02:04:11,272
What's wrong, honey?
You all right?

1098
02:04:12,713 --> 02:04:15,307
I'm just a little cold, Rachel.

1099
02:04:15,393 --> 02:04:19,102
- I'm gonna take a look around.
- All right.

1100
02:04:19,993 --> 02:04:21,984
Stay close.

1101
02:05:09,993 --> 02:05:11,870
Would you like a marble, ma'am?

1102
02:06:19,913 --> 02:06:22,188
You gotta wait
for the whistle.

1103
02:06:23,353 --> 02:06:27,232
Here I go!

1104
02:07:58,513 --> 02:08:00,071
Are you in there?

1105
02:08:08,433 --> 02:08:11,345
Why didn't you answer me, honey?
What are you?

1106
02:08:13,633 --> 02:08:17,467
Jesus, you're freezing, honey.
What's going on? Are you sick?

1107
02:08:17,553 --> 02:08:19,145
Talk to me, honey.

1108
02:08:19,233 --> 02:08:21,793
Talk to me. What's going on?

1109
02:08:21,873 --> 02:08:24,910
- What is it?
- I'm cold.

1110
02:08:29,593 --> 02:08:32,949
It's OK. It's OK.

1111
02:08:44,233 --> 02:08:47,782
Honey, when did this start?

1112
02:08:47,873 --> 02:08:49,909
Was it last night,

1113
02:08:49,993 --> 02:08:52,063
or this morning?

1114
02:08:53,153 --> 02:08:55,223
I don't remember.

1115
02:08:55,313 --> 02:08:58,066
I know you don't like me prying,
but this is important.

1116
02:09:00,353 --> 02:09:02,913
Was it your nightmare?

1117
02:09:02,993 --> 02:09:04,824
I really don't remember, Rachel.

1118
02:09:04,913 --> 02:09:06,983
I need you to try.

1119
02:09:08,353 --> 02:09:11,823
You're sick, all right? And we
need to know what started it.

1120
02:09:18,633 --> 02:09:20,669
Was she in your nightmare?

1121
02:09:44,433 --> 02:09:45,946
Don't stop.

1122
02:09:49,353 --> 02:09:52,072
- Go! Drive! Drive!
- What's the matter, honey?

1123
02:09:52,153 --> 02:09:53,711
Just don't stop the car!

1124
02:10:12,913 --> 02:10:14,062
Get down!

1125
02:10:38,953 --> 02:10:41,262
"Don't stop. "

1126
02:10:42,273 --> 02:10:45,106
You said, "Don't stop. "

1127
02:11:47,273 --> 02:11:50,424
OK. Let's see.

1128
02:11:54,633 --> 02:11:56,225
That's impossible.

1129
02:11:57,953 --> 02:12:00,183
Rachel...

1130
02:12:01,033 --> 02:12:02,512
...what's happening?

1131
02:12:07,433 --> 02:12:09,230
Yeah, hi...

1132
02:12:09,313 --> 02:12:11,190
My son is very sick

1133
02:12:11,273 --> 02:12:13,423
and I'd like to
talk to someone who...

1134
02:12:15,833 --> 02:12:21,112
Well, it's his temperature.
It's... it's five degrees low.

1135
02:12:46,953 --> 02:12:50,628
Yeah. Well, then,
I'll hold for the on-call nurse.

1136
02:12:53,793 --> 02:12:55,431
Hello?

1137
02:13:27,513 --> 02:13:30,903
Honey, the power just went out.
Are you OK up there?

1138
02:13:40,593 --> 02:13:43,232
Honey, this shouldn't be open.

1139
02:13:43,313 --> 02:13:44,666
God.

1140
02:14:00,713 --> 02:14:03,750
Aidan, let's go. Get out of bed.

1141
02:14:07,993 --> 02:14:11,144
Aidan, what are you
doing over there?

1142
02:14:12,433 --> 02:14:15,743
Get back in bed right now.

1143
02:14:15,833 --> 02:14:18,586
I saw something.

1144
02:14:31,633 --> 02:14:34,750
Move! Get away.
Get away from there.

1145
02:14:35,513 --> 02:14:38,186
Honey, let's go. Come on.

1146
02:14:44,313 --> 02:14:46,668
I saw it.

1147
02:14:46,753 --> 02:14:49,825
- I saw it in my head.
- Let's go.

1148
02:15:12,113 --> 02:15:14,104
Oh, Miss Keller...

1149
02:15:14,193 --> 02:15:17,265
- About my story. I...
- Not now.

1150
02:15:27,313 --> 02:15:32,103
Now, listen, sweetie.
Last night I found a tape.

1151
02:15:32,193 --> 02:15:34,070
It was one of hers.

1152
02:15:34,153 --> 02:15:37,304
And I made it so we'd never
have to see it again.

1153
02:15:39,153 --> 02:15:42,304
But if she knows that,

1154
02:15:42,393 --> 02:15:45,703
what I did might
make her wanna hurt us.

1155
02:15:45,793 --> 02:15:50,344
Am I right?
Do you know something, honey?

1156
02:15:50,433 --> 02:15:53,345
Look, if you know why she's here,
you have to tell me.

1157
02:15:53,433 --> 02:15:55,867
Aidan...

1158
02:15:55,953 --> 02:15:58,592
...is she here to hurt you?

1159
02:16:00,233 --> 02:16:02,189
Honey.

1160
02:16:09,833 --> 02:16:11,471
She can hear us.

1161
02:16:14,433 --> 02:16:16,549
She hears everything.

1162
02:16:18,113 --> 02:16:21,264
Except when we sleep.

1163
02:16:21,353 --> 02:16:23,469
She can't hear us
when we sleep?

1164
02:16:24,273 --> 02:16:27,231
What does that mean?

1165
02:16:27,313 --> 02:16:29,622
We have to sleep.

1166
02:16:31,753 --> 02:16:34,790
Rachel,
may I come in, please?

1167
02:16:39,513 --> 02:16:41,583
What happened to your car?

1168
02:16:41,673 --> 02:16:43,550
Your car. Apparently it's wrecked.

1169
02:16:43,633 --> 02:16:47,103
- Are you guys OK?
- Yeah. We got hit.

1170
02:16:47,193 --> 02:16:49,309
And no one's hurt?

1171
02:16:49,393 --> 02:16:51,953
That's good.

1172
02:16:52,033 --> 02:16:55,582
Aidan, right? Hi, I'm Max.

1173
02:16:57,233 --> 02:16:59,986
- Is he all right?
- He's sick.

1174
02:17:00,073 --> 02:17:01,870
How sick?

1175
02:17:07,033 --> 02:17:09,831
Max,

1176
02:17:09,913 --> 02:17:11,790
I need your help.

1177
02:17:45,113 --> 02:17:46,546
Here.

1178
02:17:46,633 --> 02:17:48,589
I'll get some more blankets.

1179
02:17:48,673 --> 02:17:51,506
The house is yours if there's
anything you need at all.

1180
02:17:51,593 --> 02:17:53,709
OK. Thanks.

1181
02:17:53,793 --> 02:17:55,431
- Here.
- Thank you.

1182
02:17:55,513 --> 02:17:58,311
- Shouldn't he be at a hospital?
- No, he's fine.

1183
02:17:58,393 --> 02:17:59,587
The bath?

1184
02:17:59,673 --> 02:18:02,267
Just down the hall.
I'll get it started.

1185
02:18:03,353 --> 02:18:05,071
Honey.

1186
02:18:06,713 --> 02:18:09,102
I'm gonna go home
and get some of our things.

1187
02:18:09,673 --> 02:18:13,871
Then we'll leave here
and never come back, OK?

1188
02:18:17,713 --> 02:18:19,465
Let's get you warmed up.

1189
02:18:19,553 --> 02:18:22,147
Not the best water pressure,
but it works.

1190
02:18:22,233 --> 02:18:24,872
It's good, thanks.
I don't know why we lost power.

1191
02:18:24,953 --> 02:18:26,147
The block seemed fine.

1192
02:18:26,233 --> 02:18:29,111
I have plenty of candles
in case the problem spreads.

1193
02:18:29,193 --> 02:18:31,149
Go ahead and get in.
Get you warmed up.

1194
02:18:31,233 --> 02:18:33,667
Max, I just need
to go back to my house,

1195
02:18:33,753 --> 02:18:35,869
get a few things,
some medicine.

1196
02:18:35,953 --> 02:18:37,750
Do you mind if you could?

1197
02:18:37,833 --> 02:18:40,142
- I'll watch him. Of course.
- OK, thanks.

1198
02:18:40,233 --> 02:18:42,952
Honey, go ahead and get in.
Let's go. Let's go.

1199
02:18:44,553 --> 02:18:47,351
We need to raise your temperature.
Now, let's get in.

1200
02:18:47,433 --> 02:18:50,470
Aidan, what's wrong?
It's just water.

1201
02:18:50,553 --> 02:18:53,909
- We need to raise your temperature...
- I don't want to, Rachel.

1202
02:18:53,993 --> 02:18:56,268
Do you want me
to get in with you?

1203
02:18:56,353 --> 02:19:00,028
Let's go then.
Aidan. Come on, let's go.

1204
02:19:00,833 --> 02:19:02,710
That's it.

1205
02:19:02,793 --> 02:19:05,671
Come on, honey.
Let's go. Let's go.

1206
02:19:05,753 --> 02:19:07,948
That's it. That's it.

1207
02:19:08,993 --> 02:19:10,904
That's better, right?

1208
02:19:10,993 --> 02:19:14,622
See? It's nice and warm.

1209
02:19:14,713 --> 02:19:18,103
It's OK. Just relax.

1210
02:21:23,113 --> 02:21:24,831
Hello?

1211
02:21:24,913 --> 02:21:28,189
Officer Ray. How you doing?

1212
02:21:28,273 --> 02:21:31,709
Yeah, good, good. All right,
what do you got for me?

1213
02:21:31,793 --> 02:21:34,546
Right.

1214
02:21:36,833 --> 02:21:39,905
Yeah, well, that all
sounds like page 26.

1215
02:21:39,993 --> 02:21:42,063
You don't have any headlines?

1216
02:21:43,073 --> 02:21:44,950
No?

1217
02:21:45,033 --> 02:21:47,263
Well, business is business.

1218
02:21:47,353 --> 02:21:50,584
Yeah. No, no, I'm good.
Real good.

1219
02:21:50,673 --> 02:21:53,267
Could you do me a little favour
while I've got you?

1220
02:21:53,353 --> 02:21:55,628
Could you look into
your accident reports

1221
02:21:55,713 --> 02:21:58,750
and see if there was an accident
with a woman and her son?

1222
02:21:58,833 --> 02:22:00,869
"K" for Keller.

1223
02:22:00,953 --> 02:22:03,421
No, no, I'm just trying
to get a story straight.

1224
02:22:05,473 --> 02:22:06,906
Ray?

1225
02:22:06,993 --> 02:22:09,553
Ray, let me call you right back. OK.

1226
02:22:16,313 --> 02:22:18,952
Everything OK in there?

1227
02:22:23,713 --> 02:22:28,343
Aidan, could you,
unlock the door, please?

1228
02:22:28,433 --> 02:22:31,664
Aidan, can you hear me?

1229
02:22:47,793 --> 02:22:49,749
Aidan, please, unlock the door!

1230
02:22:49,833 --> 02:22:51,107
Aidan, open the door!

1231
02:22:54,233 --> 02:22:56,588
He's in the bath.
It was open a second ago.

1232
02:22:56,673 --> 02:22:59,631
- Aidan, open the door!
- I'll get something to break it.

1233
02:22:59,713 --> 02:23:02,466
Aidan, open up the door.
I'm right here.

1234
02:23:02,553 --> 02:23:04,589
Honey, can you hear me? Please.

1235
02:23:04,673 --> 02:23:06,664
You need to open up the door.

1236
02:23:15,953 --> 02:23:17,511
Oh, my God.

1237
02:23:28,953 --> 02:23:31,262
Please, honey, open the...

1238
02:23:56,033 --> 02:23:59,230
Look at me. Aidan, look at me.
Look at me.

1239
02:24:25,073 --> 02:24:26,267
Mommy!

1240
02:24:38,753 --> 02:24:40,983
Rachel, no!

1241
02:24:44,873 --> 02:24:46,909
Baby. Oh.

1242
02:24:48,753 --> 02:24:51,665
Oh, my God.
Baby, I'm sorry.

1243
02:24:53,633 --> 02:24:56,670
It wasn't him. It wasn't him.

1244
02:24:56,753 --> 02:24:58,425
I was just trying to help.

1245
02:24:58,513 --> 02:25:02,301
OK, Rachel, let's just
get him out of there.

1246
02:25:09,513 --> 02:25:12,471
Why is she doing this to me?

1247
02:25:12,553 --> 02:25:13,906
I'm here now, baby.

1248
02:25:13,993 --> 02:25:16,871
- Why is she doing this to me?
- It's OK, Aidan.

1249
02:25:16,953 --> 02:25:19,547
- We're gonna get you to a hospital.
- No!

1250
02:25:19,633 --> 02:25:21,669
They can't do anything.

1251
02:25:21,753 --> 02:25:23,983
You asked for help,
you're gonna get help.

1252
02:25:24,073 --> 02:25:25,791
He gets to a hospital. Now.

1253
02:25:44,073 --> 02:25:46,792
We're working to raise
his core temperature.

1254
02:25:46,873 --> 02:25:48,750
He was at 90 degrees
when he came in.

1255
02:25:48,833 --> 02:25:54,032
- He wasn't outside overnight?
- No. He was at home with me.

1256
02:25:54,113 --> 02:25:57,310
A body doesn't develop
severe hypothermia on its own.

1257
02:25:57,393 --> 02:26:01,147
Whatever the cause, he's fighting it.
Seems like he's stabilizing.

1258
02:26:01,233 --> 02:26:04,589
- And he's just sleeping now?
- Right.

1259
02:26:04,673 --> 02:26:07,426
And having some kind of dream.

1260
02:26:23,713 --> 02:26:26,227
What's the story, Rachel?

1261
02:26:28,273 --> 02:26:31,709
They stabilized his temperature.

1262
02:26:31,793 --> 02:26:34,102
I mean the story
with you and Aidan.

1263
02:26:34,193 --> 02:26:36,229
You seem awfully hard on him.

1264
02:26:41,513 --> 02:26:45,552
Look, I know
it's a stressful time for you.

1265
02:26:45,633 --> 02:26:48,784
Moving. It's a whole new life.

1266
02:26:49,793 --> 02:26:52,671
Maybe you should tell me.

1267
02:26:56,793 --> 02:27:01,230
All I ever tried to do for him
was the right thing,

1268
02:27:01,313 --> 02:27:03,702
and it only ever
made things worse.

1269
02:27:03,793 --> 02:27:06,910
Then it wasn't
the right thing, was it?

1270
02:27:22,993 --> 02:27:25,188
What do you see?

1271
02:27:28,873 --> 02:27:30,864
Well, it's Aidan.

1272
02:27:32,273 --> 02:27:35,868
- Is that a girl there?
- Why is she in the picture?

1273
02:27:35,953 --> 02:27:38,786
- Why? How would I know?
- Why is she in all of them?

1274
02:27:41,513 --> 02:27:43,663
Her name's Samara.

1275
02:27:44,993 --> 02:27:49,271
She was murdered by her mother.
Left to die at the bottom of a well.

1276
02:27:50,473 --> 02:27:53,624
- Wait, she's... she's who?
- She didn't die.

1277
02:27:53,713 --> 02:27:58,309
At least, not her ghost.
I kept it alive for Aidan.

1278
02:27:58,393 --> 02:28:01,385
I let it out,
it spread and then we ran.

1279
02:28:01,473 --> 02:28:05,432
- What are you talking about?
- I know this sounds crazy,

1280
02:28:05,513 --> 02:28:09,791
but she's here now.
She's found us.

1281
02:28:09,873 --> 02:28:11,909
And I thought it was
just to hurt Aidan,

1282
02:28:11,993 --> 02:28:15,588
but it's more than that.
She wants to be him.

1283
02:28:15,673 --> 02:28:19,188
And she wants to live
for real this time.

1284
02:28:26,313 --> 02:28:30,192
You tell me, who can help me?

1285
02:28:30,873 --> 02:28:33,751
- Who?
- I'm sure there's a rational...

1286
02:28:33,833 --> 02:28:36,347
You take his picture
and tell me why she's in it.

1287
02:28:36,433 --> 02:28:38,628
- Rachel.
- You take his picture.

1288
02:28:38,713 --> 02:28:42,262
It's proof that he's what?
He's got a ghost inside him?

1289
02:28:42,353 --> 02:28:46,141
No. The proof
is what will happen.

1290
02:28:56,473 --> 02:28:57,588
Aidan,

1291
02:28:57,673 --> 02:29:01,632
you said Samara
couldn't hear us when we sleep.

1292
02:29:02,873 --> 02:29:05,341
Well, you're sleeping now.

1293
02:29:08,033 --> 02:29:10,786
Tell me how to stop her, honey.

1294
02:29:11,993 --> 02:29:13,824
Tell me how to help you.

1295
02:29:13,913 --> 02:29:16,871
Just tell me,
I'll do anything, I swear.

1296
02:30:28,633 --> 02:30:31,193
- Aidan?
- Miss Keller?

1297
02:30:33,473 --> 02:30:36,146
Hello, I'm Dr Emma Temple.

1298
02:30:36,233 --> 02:30:40,306
I'm a consulting physician
at County Child Services.

1299
02:30:40,393 --> 02:30:43,226
Well, I was hoping to speak
with Aidan when he wakes up.

1300
02:30:46,193 --> 02:30:48,627
Is everything all right in here?

1301
02:30:48,713 --> 02:30:51,102
Yeah. It's fine. Thank you.

1302
02:30:51,193 --> 02:30:53,787
I was hoping
to speak with you as well.

1303
02:30:53,873 --> 02:30:58,822
It's Rachel, isn't it?
Yeah, about his situation.

1304
02:30:58,913 --> 02:31:02,223
Sorry, what kind
of doctor did you say you were again?

1305
02:31:02,313 --> 02:31:03,712
I'm a psychiatrist.

1306
02:31:03,793 --> 02:31:08,708
Yeah. I spoke with a Dr...

1307
02:31:08,793 --> 02:31:11,512
...Koji in Seattle. Aidan's doctor.

1308
02:31:11,593 --> 02:31:14,027
Look, if we could
maybe talk later.

1309
02:31:14,113 --> 02:31:19,426
Right. Dr Koji mentioned
that you dealt with some PPD

1310
02:31:19,513 --> 02:31:21,583
when Aidan was born.

1311
02:31:21,673 --> 02:31:23,106
Postpartum depression.

1312
02:31:23,193 --> 02:31:25,184
That was the first month.
That's all.

1313
02:31:25,273 --> 02:31:27,548
I understand. It's very common.

1314
02:31:27,633 --> 02:31:31,751
I mean, a lot of women have trouble
adapting to the stresses of motherhood.

1315
02:31:31,833 --> 02:31:36,224
What does this have to do with
what's going on with my son right now?

1316
02:31:36,313 --> 02:31:39,623
Have you been
under stress lately?

1317
02:31:39,713 --> 02:31:43,149
Have you ever found that you were...

1318
02:31:43,233 --> 02:31:46,430
...unable to experience love for Aidan?

1319
02:31:46,513 --> 02:31:50,028
- What?
- Have you hurt him,

1320
02:31:50,113 --> 02:31:51,546
however unintentionally?

1321
02:31:51,633 --> 02:31:54,272
Have you left him alone?
Abandoned him?

1322
02:31:54,353 --> 02:31:58,232
I'd like to be with my son,
please, if you don't mind.

1323
02:32:00,193 --> 02:32:02,423
Yeah, of course.

1324
02:32:03,593 --> 02:32:05,823
I'm sorry, Rachel.

1325
02:32:08,913 --> 02:32:10,426
Until we can talk further,

1326
02:32:10,513 --> 02:32:14,188
I cannot let you be alone with him.

1327
02:32:15,273 --> 02:32:16,672
I'm his mother.

1328
02:32:18,073 --> 02:32:21,145
There are bruises on his body.

1329
02:32:21,233 --> 02:32:24,145
He was hypothermic
and very near death.

1330
02:32:24,233 --> 02:32:26,383
That is not because of me.

1331
02:32:30,633 --> 02:32:33,227
He's gonna
be all right. He will.

1332
02:32:33,313 --> 02:32:35,588
But you need to leave.

1333
02:32:35,673 --> 02:32:37,868
Now, please.

1334
02:32:43,393 --> 02:32:46,624
You can't have him,
Samara.

1335
02:32:46,713 --> 02:32:50,342
You're going back
to where you came from.

1336
02:33:14,913 --> 02:33:18,030
All I wanna know is what her
history was before the Morgans.

1337
02:33:18,113 --> 02:33:20,468
I'm sorry, but the
privacy laws still apply.

1338
02:33:20,553 --> 02:33:24,546
Well, was she really adopted?
Can you at least tell me that much?

1339
02:33:24,633 --> 02:33:27,864
- Was their story true?
- Samara Morgan was adopted, yes.

1340
02:33:27,953 --> 02:33:30,626
But you won't tell me from who?

1341
02:33:30,713 --> 02:33:33,910
- I'd lose my job if I did.
- Look, ma'am,

1342
02:33:33,993 --> 02:33:37,702
my son has a medical condition
that his doctors don't even understand.

1343
02:33:37,793 --> 02:33:39,943
This little girl
had the same condition.

1344
02:33:40,033 --> 02:33:44,185
Now, if I knew what caused that,
it could save his life.

1345
02:33:44,273 --> 02:33:48,152
All I can say is you
should speak to the Morgans.

1346
02:33:48,233 --> 02:33:51,987
They're dead.
They both killed themselves.

1347
02:35:19,473 --> 02:35:22,545
Look out. Early birds.

1348
02:35:22,633 --> 02:35:24,828
Marty Savide,
Stevens Northwest Realty.

1349
02:35:24,913 --> 02:35:27,222
- Hi.
- Come in.

1350
02:35:27,313 --> 02:35:30,589
I thought I put 12.30 on the ad.
For the open house.

1351
02:35:30,673 --> 02:35:33,187
- How'd you get around the gate?
- Well, I just...

1352
02:35:33,273 --> 02:35:34,865
Ah! Who cares? Come on.

1353
02:35:34,953 --> 02:35:38,707
Make me an offer
over asking and it's yours.

1354
02:35:38,793 --> 02:35:41,432
OK, then, don't mind me.

1355
02:35:41,513 --> 02:35:45,711
My first try with these things,
took off flying.

1356
02:35:46,473 --> 02:35:48,384
There we go.

1357
02:35:48,473 --> 02:35:50,304
What do you think?

1358
02:35:50,393 --> 02:35:54,306
A little colour will really
turn the place around.

1359
02:35:54,393 --> 02:35:56,145
It's got a wonderful history.

1360
02:35:56,233 --> 02:35:58,189
Working horse ranch.
How about that?

1361
02:35:58,273 --> 02:36:02,983
And there's even this cute little
tree house thing way up in the barn.

1362
02:36:03,073 --> 02:36:07,464
Is the place being
sold unfurnished or?

1363
02:36:07,553 --> 02:36:10,147
The previous owners
didn't leave anything behind?

1364
02:36:10,233 --> 02:36:15,591
Well, there were some things
that were left, after they...

1365
02:36:15,673 --> 02:36:16,822
...moved.

1366
02:36:16,913 --> 02:36:19,347
We're storing all that
in the basement.

1367
02:36:19,433 --> 02:36:21,424
There's a basement?

1368
02:36:21,513 --> 02:36:25,506
Well, you betcha.
No extra charge.

1369
02:36:25,593 --> 02:36:27,549
Right this way.

1370
02:36:36,953 --> 02:36:39,786
If you don't mind,
I'm the welcome wagon.

1371
02:36:39,873 --> 02:36:41,829
Gotta open up the gate for everyone.

1372
02:36:41,913 --> 02:36:43,949
So please,
just make yourself at home.

1373
02:36:44,033 --> 02:36:48,345
Do you know what happened
to them? The previous owners?

1374
02:36:48,433 --> 02:36:50,583
I believe they bought
a condo in Phoenix.

1375
02:36:50,673 --> 02:36:51,947
Really?

1376
02:40:09,833 --> 02:40:11,903
Her mother.

1377
02:40:42,713 --> 02:40:44,863
I'll take it from here.

1378
02:40:50,153 --> 02:40:53,429
Hello, Aidan, I'm Dr Temple.

1379
02:40:53,513 --> 02:40:54,912
How are you feeling?

1380
02:40:58,113 --> 02:41:00,149
Aidan?

1381
02:41:01,753 --> 02:41:05,428
You know,
I'd really like to help you.

1382
02:41:05,513 --> 02:41:08,630
Can you tell me
how you're feeling?

1383
02:41:10,713 --> 02:41:12,305
Where's my mommy?

1384
02:41:12,393 --> 02:41:16,466
Well, she'll be here soon.
She's on her way.

1385
02:41:16,553 --> 02:41:19,067
I want Mommy.

1386
02:41:19,153 --> 02:41:21,030
Yeah, I know you do.

1387
02:41:21,113 --> 02:41:23,308
Your mommy
wants to be with you too.

1388
02:41:23,393 --> 02:41:26,032
So where is she?

1389
02:41:26,113 --> 02:41:27,751
She went home.

1390
02:41:27,833 --> 02:41:30,552
She didn't think that you
were gonna wake up so soon.

1391
02:41:30,633 --> 02:41:32,271
I wanna go home too.

1392
02:41:32,353 --> 02:41:34,583
Well, you will.

1393
02:41:34,673 --> 02:41:38,552
We just have to...
We just have to get you...

1394
02:41:42,273 --> 02:41:44,309
You're freezing.

1395
02:41:45,513 --> 02:41:47,743
I wanna go home to Mommy.

1396
02:41:49,753 --> 02:41:53,223
Well, we need to talk about her.

1397
02:41:53,313 --> 02:41:56,111
Can you tell me
about Mommy a little bit?

1398
02:41:57,553 --> 02:42:00,272
She loves me.

1399
02:42:00,353 --> 02:42:02,309
I know that she does.

1400
02:42:02,393 --> 02:42:06,830
She went looking for me.
She tried to find me.

1401
02:42:06,913 --> 02:42:09,188
It means she loves me.

1402
02:42:10,273 --> 02:42:12,150
I don't understand.

1403
02:42:15,473 --> 02:42:17,111
Can I go home now?

1404
02:42:19,033 --> 02:42:21,752
No, honey,
you're not well enough.

1405
02:42:25,233 --> 02:42:26,985
Can I go home?

1406
02:42:27,673 --> 02:42:29,186
No.

1407
02:42:36,833 --> 02:42:38,903
I'm sorry.

1408
02:42:46,953 --> 02:42:49,990
Then I have
to show you something.

1409
02:43:45,153 --> 02:43:46,905
It won't stop.

1410
02:44:29,313 --> 02:44:32,749
I'm gonna walk you
just around the corner here.

1411
02:44:46,713 --> 02:44:49,750
Her name was Evelyn.

1412
02:44:49,833 --> 02:44:52,222
She came to us
eight months pregnant.

1413
02:44:52,313 --> 02:44:54,065
- Did she have her baby here?
- Yes.

1414
02:44:54,153 --> 02:44:55,984
And you arranged
for the adoption?

1415
02:44:56,073 --> 02:44:57,631
That's right.

1416
02:44:57,713 --> 02:45:01,501
- And the father?
- There was none.

1417
02:45:03,273 --> 02:45:05,423
Half the mothers
that come to us say that.

1418
02:45:05,513 --> 02:45:08,346
So, what did she think
got her pregnant?

1419
02:45:08,433 --> 02:45:09,502
Evelyn wasn't well.

1420
02:45:09,593 --> 02:45:12,312
She had been having problems
during the pregnancy:

1421
02:45:12,393 --> 02:45:14,748
Hallucinations, visions.

1422
02:45:14,833 --> 02:45:18,109
She believed some thing
had come for her baby

1423
02:45:18,193 --> 02:45:20,548
from the waters of the world
beyond this one.

1424
02:45:20,633 --> 02:45:22,783
I'm sorry. Did you say water?

1425
02:45:22,873 --> 02:45:27,469
Well, we all envision
the afterlife differently.

1426
02:45:27,553 --> 02:45:32,308
For Evelyn,
it's just what she believed.

1427
02:45:32,393 --> 02:45:36,352
As you might imagine, she suffered
severe postpartum depression.

1428
02:45:36,433 --> 02:45:39,550
She blamed her troubles
on her child.

1429
02:45:39,633 --> 02:45:42,431
So she tried to kill it.

1430
02:45:47,833 --> 02:45:50,586
All babies are a challenge.

1431
02:45:50,673 --> 02:45:54,985
But Samara, she never cried.

1432
02:45:55,073 --> 02:45:56,904
Never.

1433
02:45:56,993 --> 02:45:59,382
Except when her mother
would try to bathe her.

1434
02:45:59,473 --> 02:46:03,307
Then she'd scream like it
was the end of the world.

1435
02:46:08,273 --> 02:46:10,150
It was the screaming that woke us.

1436
02:46:18,233 --> 02:46:20,827
Evelyn, don't!

1437
02:46:25,833 --> 02:46:27,789
Evelyn!

1438
02:46:27,873 --> 02:46:30,023
Evelyn, stop!

1439
02:46:42,233 --> 02:46:44,383
She was trying
to drown the baby.

1440
02:46:44,473 --> 02:46:46,782
The baby was taken from her,
of course.

1441
02:46:46,873 --> 02:46:49,262
Evelyn was institutionalized.

1442
02:46:49,353 --> 02:46:51,787
And all those pictures
she'd been collecting,

1443
02:46:51,873 --> 02:46:54,910
they finally made sense.

1444
02:46:58,033 --> 02:47:00,945
Did she say why she did it?

1445
02:47:01,033 --> 02:47:04,423
She felt she had to kill
her baby to save it.

1446
02:48:02,073 --> 02:48:04,462
I'm here to see a patient.
Her name's Evelyn.

1447
02:48:04,553 --> 02:48:07,113
- I don't know her last name.
- Evelyn?

1448
02:48:07,193 --> 02:48:09,229
That's right.

1449
02:48:11,153 --> 02:48:12,950
Evelyn's expecting you.

1450
02:48:13,033 --> 02:48:15,501
Every few years, one of you
comes to see Evelyn.

1451
02:48:15,593 --> 02:48:18,630
She's like a freakin'
patron saint or something.

1452
02:48:18,713 --> 02:48:21,352
Got a problem with your kid,
don't you?

1453
02:48:27,033 --> 02:48:28,989
Something wrong?

1454
02:48:29,073 --> 02:48:32,270
That song. I know it.

1455
02:48:32,353 --> 02:48:34,309
Yeah. They all do.

1456
02:48:40,513 --> 02:48:42,265
Hey, Evelyn.

1457
02:48:42,353 --> 02:48:46,141
You were right as rain.
You got a visitor today.

1458
02:48:46,233 --> 02:48:48,701
Hope she's some help
to your troubles.

1459
02:48:48,793 --> 02:48:50,704
Ten minutes.

1460
02:48:56,393 --> 02:48:59,465
My name's Rachel.

1461
02:48:59,553 --> 02:49:01,544
But you know that.

1462
02:49:06,913 --> 02:49:10,064
Some days I
sort of have a feeling.

1463
02:49:11,193 --> 02:49:13,388
A feeling?

1464
02:49:13,473 --> 02:49:16,146
This is about your child.

1465
02:49:20,033 --> 02:49:21,022
It's...

1466
02:49:23,313 --> 02:49:25,907
It's about yours.

1467
02:49:25,993 --> 02:49:27,904
Samara.

1468
02:49:35,113 --> 02:49:37,468
They don't dream, you know.

1469
02:49:38,513 --> 02:49:40,583
The dead don't dream.

1470
02:49:44,393 --> 02:49:46,429
Look, something's happened
to my son.

1471
02:49:46,513 --> 02:49:49,550
- You have to sleep to dream.
- It has to do with your daughter.

1472
02:49:49,633 --> 02:49:51,510
And the dead never sleep.

1473
02:49:51,593 --> 02:49:52,867
They wait...

1474
02:49:54,433 --> 02:49:56,822
...and watch for a way back.

1475
02:49:59,033 --> 02:50:01,752
But they never sleep.

1476
02:50:01,833 --> 02:50:04,631
- That's why dreams are safe.
- I'm sorry, I just...

1477
02:50:04,713 --> 02:50:08,262
I don't have a lot of time.
Please, I need your help.

1478
02:50:08,353 --> 02:50:10,423
I have to know.
Can you tell me?

1479
02:50:12,073 --> 02:50:14,268
Why did you try
to kill your baby?

1480
02:50:16,233 --> 02:50:18,144
Why?

1481
02:50:19,713 --> 02:50:21,624
Because my baby told me to.

1482
02:50:22,833 --> 02:50:24,983
Just like yours will tell you.

1483
02:50:25,073 --> 02:50:28,224
And you have to do it.

1484
02:50:28,313 --> 02:50:31,066
- You have to send it back.
- What?

1485
02:50:36,753 --> 02:50:39,904
They stopped me.

1486
02:50:39,993 --> 02:50:43,224
- Don't let them stop you.
- What?

1487
02:50:44,833 --> 02:50:46,903
Listen to the voices.

1488
02:50:46,993 --> 02:50:48,790
What are you talking about?

1489
02:50:48,873 --> 02:50:51,626
Because it's our fault. We did it.

1490
02:50:51,713 --> 02:50:53,908
Yes. We did it. Yes.

1491
02:50:53,993 --> 02:50:55,904
It was you.
It was you! You did it!

1492
02:50:55,993 --> 02:50:57,506
What did I do?

1493
02:50:59,873 --> 02:51:02,626
Evelyn, that's enough.

1494
02:51:04,033 --> 02:51:06,991
I love my son.

1495
02:51:07,073 --> 02:51:09,712
Come on. It's all right.

1496
02:51:10,113 --> 02:51:13,503
I'm sorry, ma'am,
that's enough for today.

1497
02:51:13,593 --> 02:51:15,106
Let's go.

1498
02:51:15,193 --> 02:51:17,263
What did I do?

1499
02:51:18,153 --> 02:51:19,950
You let the dead get in.

1500
02:51:22,393 --> 02:51:23,985
Let's go.

1501
02:51:36,873 --> 02:51:38,784
What should I do?

1502
02:51:40,433 --> 02:51:42,742
Be a good mother.

1503
02:51:43,993 --> 02:51:46,746
Listen to your baby.

1504
02:52:53,513 --> 02:52:55,469
Hey.

1505
02:52:59,993 --> 02:53:01,745
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

1506
02:53:01,833 --> 02:53:04,791
No. I'm here
waiting for my mommy.

1507
02:53:04,873 --> 02:53:06,943
OK.

1508
02:53:07,033 --> 02:53:11,868
Well, you can't really leave
till the hospital says it's OK.

1509
02:53:11,953 --> 02:53:14,592
You were very, very sick.

1510
02:53:16,393 --> 02:53:18,349
You're all right now?

1511
02:53:23,593 --> 02:53:25,106
The cable setup at my house,

1512
02:53:25,193 --> 02:53:28,947
the TV needs to be
on channel three.

1513
02:53:29,033 --> 02:53:32,423
<i>She loves me. 
She loves me not. </i>

1514
02:53:32,513 --> 02:53:35,027
- Thank you, Max.
- Sure.

1515
02:53:37,073 --> 02:53:39,462
<i>She loves me!</i>

1516
02:53:39,553 --> 02:53:42,113
<i>Look, Mandy!</i>

1517
02:53:43,913 --> 02:53:45,790
<i>I think I'm gonna puke. </i>

1518
02:53:45,873 --> 02:53:48,785
<i>Why don't you do something
productive with your life?</i>

1519
02:53:50,553 --> 02:53:53,306
<i>Say, Billy,
if you like fish so much... </i>

1520
02:53:53,393 --> 02:53:54,951
Your mom loves you, you know.

1521
02:53:55,873 --> 02:53:57,909
She loves you a lot.

1522
02:54:01,393 --> 02:54:04,032
You'd tell someone if you
weren't sure about that?

1523
02:54:04,113 --> 02:54:09,062
Like, if she'd been
hurting you somehow.

1524
02:54:10,553 --> 02:54:13,113
Did she ever treat you
like you're someone else?

1525
02:54:13,193 --> 02:54:16,424
I'm not somebody else.
I'm Aidan.

1526
02:54:16,513 --> 02:54:18,424
- I know.
- We don't need anyone else.

1527
02:54:18,513 --> 02:54:19,832
That's right.

1528
02:54:19,913 --> 02:54:24,748
We don't need you,
that doctor or anyone else.

1529
02:54:43,153 --> 02:54:44,666
What are you doing?

1530
02:54:46,273 --> 02:54:48,787
I was just gonna
take a picture of you.

1531
02:54:48,873 --> 02:54:51,592
No.

1532
02:54:53,193 --> 02:54:55,024
- It'll be for your mom.
- No.

1533
02:54:55,113 --> 02:54:58,025
Why not? What's wrong
with taking your picture?

1534
02:54:58,113 --> 02:55:01,583
I'll tell you what's wrong
if you promise not to take it.

1535
02:55:01,673 --> 02:55:03,425
But that's only if you promise.

1536
02:55:03,513 --> 02:55:06,232
Fine. I promise.

1537
02:55:14,633 --> 02:55:16,146
So, Aidan, what's the story?

1538
02:55:35,793 --> 02:55:40,708
<i>¤ We're happy when we're sad</i>

1539
02:55:40,793 --> 02:55:44,069
<i>¤ We're always feeling sad</i>

1540
02:55:44,153 --> 02:55:46,144
Hello?

1541
02:55:46,233 --> 02:55:49,623
<i>- How are you?
- Terrible. </i>

1542
02:55:49,713 --> 02:55:55,504
<i>¤ That's why we're happy
when we're sad ¤</i>

1543
02:56:01,633 --> 02:56:03,271
Max?

1544
02:56:05,153 --> 02:56:07,109
Are you here?

1545
02:56:18,673 --> 02:56:20,311
- You're home!
- God.

1546
02:56:20,393 --> 02:56:23,226
What are you doing?
I thought you were at the hospital.

1547
02:56:23,313 --> 02:56:25,588
No. I'm here, Mommy.

1548
02:56:28,033 --> 02:56:32,185
- What did you say?
- I said I'm here.

1549
02:56:34,113 --> 02:56:36,024
Is Max here?

1550
02:56:37,153 --> 02:56:38,984
No.

1551
02:56:39,073 --> 02:56:41,382
But his coat...

1552
02:56:48,553 --> 02:56:52,102
He went away.
You wanna watch some TV with me?

1553
02:56:57,353 --> 02:57:01,744
I just have to get
something from the car. OK?

1554
02:57:07,273 --> 02:57:09,787
I love you, Mommy.

1555
02:57:47,073 --> 02:57:48,825
Max.

1556
02:58:37,793 --> 02:58:41,547
<i>Goldfish must have water
in order to exist. </i>

1557
02:58:41,633 --> 02:58:44,784
<i>But goldfish hate cats. </i>

1558
02:58:50,673 --> 02:58:54,666
<i>While on the other hand,
cats hate water. </i>

1559
02:59:31,513 --> 02:59:34,073
Are you sleeping, Rachel?

1560
02:59:34,913 --> 02:59:38,952
I am. She makes me sleep
all the time now.

1561
02:59:40,753 --> 02:59:43,221
Just keep sleeping, Rachel.

1562
02:59:43,313 --> 02:59:46,783
So she can't hear us.
It's the only way.

1563
02:59:46,873 --> 02:59:49,148
You have to show her, Rachel.

1564
02:59:49,233 --> 02:59:50,586
Show her she can't stay.

1565
02:59:50,673 --> 02:59:53,710
In you.

1566
02:59:53,793 --> 02:59:57,263
How? How do I do that?

1567
02:59:57,353 --> 03:00:00,345
Take me to where she's afraid of.

1568
03:00:00,433 --> 03:00:03,106
You know where she's afraid of.

1569
03:00:03,193 --> 03:00:04,831
Take me there...

1570
03:00:06,153 --> 03:00:08,030
...and kill me.
- Aidan, no.

1571
03:00:08,113 --> 03:00:10,946
Rachel, keep sleeping.

1572
03:00:11,033 --> 03:00:14,582
She won't stay if she knows
you'll kill me.

1573
03:00:14,673 --> 03:00:19,064
- It's the only way.
- I can't do it. I can't.

1574
03:00:23,353 --> 03:00:24,752
Then she stays.

1575
03:00:27,153 --> 03:00:29,428
She's heard us.

1576
03:00:50,313 --> 03:00:52,304
Honey?

1577
03:00:52,393 --> 03:00:54,907
I thought you were sleeping,
Mommy.

1578
03:00:56,433 --> 03:00:59,345
I was, but I had a bad dream.

1579
03:00:59,433 --> 03:01:01,663
You must've had a nightmare.

1580
03:01:01,753 --> 03:01:05,428
It's all right.
We all have them.

1581
03:01:07,513 --> 03:01:09,868
Will you stay with me now?

1582
03:01:09,953 --> 03:01:13,423
- Stay?
- Stay for always.

1583
03:01:16,033 --> 03:01:17,864
Yeah. Yeah.

1584
03:01:17,953 --> 03:01:21,025
Alrighty.
Let's watch some TV together.

1585
03:01:23,473 --> 03:01:25,668
It's kind of late, honey.

1586
03:01:27,233 --> 03:01:29,667
Don't you think
you should sleep?

1587
03:01:33,513 --> 03:01:36,186
I never sleep.

1588
03:01:41,473 --> 03:01:44,351
Then let Mommy
make you something.

1589
03:03:00,233 --> 03:03:03,384
Something wrong?
You seem sad.

1590
03:03:05,313 --> 03:03:07,588
No, honey, I'm not sad.

1591
03:03:08,993 --> 03:03:11,632
I'm just tired, that's all.

1592
03:03:13,233 --> 03:03:15,872
Well, now you have me
to protect you.

1593
03:03:46,033 --> 03:03:49,423
<i>¤ You ain't the biggest catfish
in the deep blue sea ¤¤</i>

1594
03:04:01,673 --> 03:04:04,028
Take me to where
she's afraid of.

1595
03:04:04,113 --> 03:04:06,104
You know where she's afraid of.

1596
03:04:07,713 --> 03:04:09,624
You have to show her, Rachel.

1597
03:04:09,713 --> 03:04:12,511
Show her she can't stay.

1598
03:04:14,353 --> 03:04:16,264
Listen to the voices.

1599
03:04:16,353 --> 03:04:18,947
You have to listen to the voices.

1600
03:04:22,673 --> 03:04:25,949
Be a good mother.
Be a good mother.

1601
03:04:27,033 --> 03:04:29,388
Listen to your baby.

1602
03:05:23,073 --> 03:05:24,586
I'm sorry.

1603
03:05:25,593 --> 03:05:27,868
I'm so sorry.

1604
03:05:29,073 --> 03:05:31,667
But you can't stay.

1605
03:05:38,553 --> 03:05:41,989
What are you doing? Rachel!

1606
03:05:42,073 --> 03:05:43,586
What are you doing?

1607
03:05:43,673 --> 03:05:45,425
It's me.

1608
03:05:45,513 --> 03:05:47,788
- It's not her, Rachel.
- I know, baby.

1609
03:05:47,873 --> 03:05:50,148
It's me.

1610
03:05:50,233 --> 03:05:53,430
I love you. Mommy, I love you.

1611
03:05:53,513 --> 03:05:55,583
I know, baby.

1612
03:05:57,353 --> 03:06:00,026
I love you too.

1613
03:06:12,193 --> 03:06:14,707
But you're not my son.

1614
03:06:50,833 --> 03:06:53,108
Mommy.

1615
03:07:18,193 --> 03:07:19,672
Honey.

1616
03:07:21,793 --> 03:07:25,229
Breathe. Baby, breathe.

1617
03:07:25,313 --> 03:07:28,350
Please. I know it's you, honey.

1618
03:07:31,913 --> 03:07:34,507
Aidan, please.

1619
03:07:43,033 --> 03:07:45,342
I'm right here.

1620
03:07:46,553 --> 03:07:47,872
You're OK.

1621
03:07:47,953 --> 03:07:51,025
Everything's all right, honey.

1622
03:07:54,513 --> 03:07:56,663
You were sleeping.

1623
03:07:56,753 --> 03:07:59,665
You were just sleeping.

1624
03:08:15,873 --> 03:08:17,943
No.

1625
03:08:30,353 --> 03:08:32,184
She wants me again.

1626
03:08:34,673 --> 03:08:36,664
No.

1627
03:08:42,993 --> 03:08:46,269
Rachel, what are you doing?

1628
03:08:48,353 --> 03:08:52,949
All she wants is a mother.
That's all she wants.

1629
03:08:55,313 --> 03:08:59,022
And she'll keep coming
till she finds one.

1630
03:08:59,113 --> 03:09:01,104
Come on!
Come back!

1631
03:09:01,193 --> 03:09:03,468
Get away from her! Rachel!

1632
03:09:03,553 --> 03:09:05,509
Get away from her!

1633
03:09:08,193 --> 03:09:09,945
You can't have my son.

1634
03:09:13,913 --> 03:09:16,666
So take me.

1635
03:09:16,753 --> 03:09:18,266
Rachel! No!

1636
03:10:02,273 --> 03:10:03,626
Samara!

1637
03:10:04,633 --> 03:10:07,022
Here I am, Samara.

1638
03:10:08,873 --> 03:10:11,671
Just like you wanted.

1639
03:10:13,793 --> 03:10:17,149
But you leave him alone!

1640
03:10:17,233 --> 03:10:18,871
You hear me?

1641
03:10:25,953 --> 03:10:27,671
Help me.

1642
03:10:36,913 --> 03:10:39,746
It's always open.

1643
03:10:39,833 --> 03:10:44,031
Her only way out
is always open.

1644
03:11:05,953 --> 03:11:10,424
Mommy.

1645
03:13:22,433 --> 03:13:25,584
- Mommy!
- I'm not your fucking mommy.

1646
03:15:13,353 --> 03:15:16,982
- Can you hear me?
- I can hear you.

1647
03:15:17,073 --> 03:15:19,428
I'm right here.

1648
03:15:56,513 --> 03:15:58,424
You're here.

1649
03:16:00,113 --> 03:16:03,628
- You're here, Rachel.
- Of course I'm here.

1650
03:16:03,713 --> 03:16:06,546
I followed your voice.

1651
03:16:08,553 --> 03:16:10,350
What happened?

1652
03:16:12,513 --> 03:16:15,073
It's over, honey.

1653
03:16:16,033 --> 03:16:18,627
She's not coming back.

1654
03:16:18,713 --> 03:16:21,386
How do you know, Rachel?

1655
03:16:24,153 --> 03:16:26,223
I know.

1656
03:16:28,113 --> 03:16:29,944
I promise.

1657
03:16:36,833 --> 03:16:39,347
I love you, Mommy.

1658
03:16:41,513 --> 03:16:43,708
Promise me something?

1659
03:16:43,793 --> 03:16:47,263
Yeah. Anything, Mom. Anything.

1660
03:16:47,353 --> 03:16:49,742
Just call me Rachel.

1661
03:16:51,353 --> 03:16:52,991
At least for a while.
