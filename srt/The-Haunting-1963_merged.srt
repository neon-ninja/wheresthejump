1
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:18,890
<i>An evil old house,</i>
<i>the kind some people call haunted...</i>

2
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:23,135
<i>is like an undiscovered country</i>
<i>waiting to be explored.</i>

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,142
<i>Hill House had stood for 90 years</i>
<i>and might stand for 90 more.</i>

4
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:33,271
<i>Silence lay steadily against the wood</i>
<i>and stone of Hill House.</i>

5
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:37,248
<i>Whatever walked there walked alone.</i>

6
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,010
<i>Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide.</i>

7
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:19,044
<i>The history of Hill House was ideal.</i>

8
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:21,215
<i>It had everything I wanted.</i>

9
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,058
<i>It was built 90-odd, very odd years ago...</i>

10
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:28,689
<i>by a man named Hugh Crain</i>
<i>as a home for his wife and daughter...</i>

11
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:31,734
<i>in the most remote part of New England</i>
<i>he could find.</i>

12
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:38,599
<i>It was an evil house from the beginning.</i>

13
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:40,700
<i>A house that was born bad.</i>

14
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:49,717
<i>Hugh Crain's young wife...</i>

15
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:52,983
<i>died seconds before</i>
<i>she was to set eyes on the house.</i>

16
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,226
<i>She was killed when,</i>
<i>for no apparent reason...</i>

17
00:02:57,293 --> 00:03:01,024
<i>the horses bolted,</i>
<i>crashing her carriage against a big tree.</i>

18
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:09,134
<i>Mrs. Crain was carried...</i>

19
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:12,606
<i>lifeless is the word, I think...</i>

20
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:15,576
<i>into the home</i>
<i>her husband had built for her.</i>

21
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,610
<i>Hugh Crain was left an embittered man...</i>

22
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,285
<i>with a small daughter, Abigail, to bring up.</i>

23
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:44,362
<i>Fortunately, for me, that is...</i>

24
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:48,173
<i>Hugh Crain did not leave Hill House.</i>
<i>He married again.</i>

25
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,183
<i>The second Mrs. Crain's death</i>
<i>was even more interesting...</i>

26
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:02,156
<i>than her predecessor's.</i>

27
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:19,137
<i>I've been unable to find out</i>
<i>how or why she fell...</i>

28
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:21,869
<i>although I have my suspicions.</i>

29
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,882
<i>Hugh Crain left Abigail with a nurse</i>
<i>and went to England...</i>

30
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:34,446
<i>where he died in a drowning accident.</i>

31
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,786
<i>Marvelous!</i>

32
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:40,022
<i>I mean, the way the history of Hill House</i>
<i>follows a classic pattern.</i>

33
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,457
<i>For some reason...</i>

34
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,368
<i>Abigail kept that same nursery room</i>
<i>in Hill House where she grew up...</i>

35
00:04:49,238 --> 00:04:50,728
<i>and grew old.</i>

36
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:08,915
<i>In later years,</i>
<i>she became a bedridden invalid.</i>

37
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:13,261
<i>She took a girl from the village</i>
<i>to live with her as a paid companion.</i>

38
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,763
<i>It's with this young companion...</i>

39
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:21,861
<i>the evil reputation of Hill House</i>
<i>really begins.</i>

40
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:31,237
<i>The story goes</i>
<i>that the old lady died calling for help...</i>

41
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:33,339
<i>in the nursery upstairs...</i>

42
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:37,416
<i>while the companion fooled around</i>
<i>with a farm hand on the verandah.</i>

43
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:52,525
<i>The companion inherited Hill House</i>
<i>and occupied it for many years.</i>

44
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:55,603
<i>The local people believe that,</i>
<i>one way or another...</i>

45
00:05:55,671 --> 00:05:58,003
<i>she had murdered her benefactor.</i>

46
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,874
<i>She lived a life of complete solitude</i>
<i>in the empty house...</i>

47
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,004
<i>though some say</i>
<i>that the house was not empty...</i>

48
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:08,573
<i>and never has been</i>
<i>since the night old Miss Abby died.</i>

49
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:14,186
<i>They say that whatever there was</i>
<i>and still is in the house...</i>

50
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:17,492
<i>eventually drove the companion mad.</i>

51
00:06:21,497 --> 00:06:23,590
<i>We do know she hanged herself.</i>

52
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,259
<i>After her death...</i>

53
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:29,236
<i>the house passed legally into the hands</i>
<i>of a distant relative in Boston...</i>

54
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:33,901
<i>an old lady, Mrs. Sannerson,</i>
<i>who I very much wanted to see.</i>

55
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:38,480
All my life I've been looking
for an honestly haunted house.

56
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:42,484
In the interests of psychic research,
you must let me have it for a few weeks.

57
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:46,886
No one who rented Hill House
ever stayed for more than a few days.

58
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,357
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.

59
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:53,218
I don't believe it.

60
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:55,560
Dr. Markway is a trained anthropologist...

61
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:57,963
a respected member
of a university faculty.

62
00:06:58,034 --> 00:07:00,628
We should welcome such a man
to investigate Hill House.

63
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:01,795
Perhaps.

64
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:04,772
As an old woman due shortly
to enter the next world...

65
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,468
I'd like to know if there is one.

66
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:10,501
I'm sure his report will give Hill House
a clean bill of health.

67
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:14,849
How will you go about conducting
your investigations, Dr. Markway?

68
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:19,110
I shall occupy the house with a group
of carefully selected assistants...

69
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,816
- Assistants?
- My dear Mrs. Sannerson...

70
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,183
I am a scientist conducting
an unusual experiment.

71
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:27,855
A haunted house. Everyone laughs.

72
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,194
So I must have specially qualified help...

73
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:33,702
to take notes and document any evidence
of the supernatural I may find.

74
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:36,897
- Who are these assistants?
- I haven't made my final choice yet...

75
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:40,238
but they're from a list of names
I've been assembling over the years.

76
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:43,176
- We don't want any publicity seekers.
- Of course not.

77
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:46,545
These people have only been selected
after painstaking research.

78
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:50,518
They've all been involved before,
one way or another, with the abnormal.

79
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:52,486
I don't like the sound of that.

80
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,991
- Are any of the people women?
- Some.

81
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:58,253
- Are you a married man?
- Yes.

82
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,189
Then your wife will be accompanying you.

83
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:02,821
I'm afraid not.

84
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,300
My wife disapproves of my experiments
with the supernatural.

85
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:08,428
She wants no part of Hill House.

86
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:11,337
To make sure
that everything is as it should be...

87
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,274
suppose your nephew
goes along with Dr. Markway?

88
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:15,332
Luke?

89
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,672
Our young Lochinvar
from out of the Midwest.

90
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:22,808
I haven't much confidence
in that branch of the family.

91
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:26,514
In this case, I think you can.
Luke expects to inherit Hill House...

92
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,524
and he'll make sure
that his property is well taken care of.

93
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,889
His property?

94
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:35,430
Still, it might be rather good at that.

95
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:39,126
Luke hopes one day to live off Hill House.

96
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:42,399
But he never dreamed
to find himself living in it.

97
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:45,970
Harper, give Dr. Markway his lease.

98
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:47,600
Thank you, Mrs. Sannerson.

99
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:50,737
A word of warning:
Don't play gin with Luke.

100
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:52,007
He's a cardsharp.

101
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:55,073
Good. That indicates a strong instinct
for self-preservation.

102
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:59,383
Exactly what do you and your assistants
expect to find at Hill House?

103
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:04,056
Maybe only a few loose floorboards,
and maybe...

104
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,389
I only say maybe...

105
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:09,088
the key to another world.

106
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:31,350
You've just got to let me have the car.

107
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,483
There's no other way of getting there,
and I'm expected.

108
00:09:34,557 --> 00:09:37,185
- Calm down.
- I've even bought some new clothes.

109
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,693
Please, Bud.

110
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:43,030
Carrie drives the car all the time
and I never even take it out of the garage.

111
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:45,363
- Mother...
- Mother what?

112
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:48,901
Nothing.

113
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:55,577
Auntie Nell is blinking.

114
00:09:58,214 --> 00:09:59,613
Quiet, Dora.

115
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:03,247
Let's talk this over without anybody
getting emotional or nervous.

116
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:05,378
Why shouldn't I be nervous?

117
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:09,049
My first chance for a vacation in my life
and you won't let me take it.

118
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,060
There's a good reason Mother was afraid
for you to go anywhere...

119
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,356
and it still applies.

120
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:16,990
We're not going to dig up
the family skeleton again, are we?

121
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:19,666
I think you should have a vacation, Nell.

122
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:23,330
Nobody knows better than me what you
went through during your mother's illness.

123
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:26,341
Dirty laundry,
the smell of that sickroom...

124
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:28,735
Talk about mean old ladies!

125
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,704
Let the dead rest in peace.

126
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,875
It's half my car.
I helped pay for it and I mean to take it.

127
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,747
We don't know where you're going.

128
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:39,686
You haven't seen fit
to tell us anything, have you?

129
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:41,518
No, you may not have the car.

130
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,320
What beats me is why
you're playing this thing so cozy...

131
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,758
like this was a jailbreak.

132
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:49,924
In any case, I'm sure I'm doing
what Mother would have thought best.

133
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:54,001
Although I don't suppose
poor Mother's wishes mean much to you.

134
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,295
Get out. Get out, both of you.

135
00:10:58,174 --> 00:11:01,666
Now just a minute, young lady.
You happen to be in my living room.

136
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,612
I happen to be in my bedroom,
and I pay a good part of your rent for it.

137
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:09,208
Now get out before I show you
what my nerves can really do!

138
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:16,049
Besides, how do I know you'll
bring back my car in good condition?

139
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,353
Come on.

140
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:42,074
I want my car. I mean to take it.

141
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:44,311
- Which?
- The Fredericks' car.

142
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,351
- You ain't Mrs. Fredericks.
- It's half mine.

143
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:53,725
- Who are you?
- Her sister, Miss Lance.

144
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,459
Look, here's my driver's license...

145
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,364
here's my library card...

146
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,197
and here's a blood donor card.

147
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:08,040
All the same address as my sister's.
I live with her.

148
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,537
- Front row, left of the far pillar.
- Thank you.

149
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:31,732
"Very happy that you'll be joining us
in Hill House.

150
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:34,031
"Take US 50 from Boston...

151
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:37,038
"and watch for the turnoff
onto Route 238."

152
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:41,774
<i>Route 238.</i>

153
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:45,438
<i>At last I am going someplace</i>
<i>where I'm expected...</i>

154
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,744
<i>and where I'm being given shelter.</i>

155
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:50,342
<i>And I shall never have to come back.</i>

156
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:52,987
<i>I hope...</i>

157
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:55,922
<i>This is what I've been waiting for</i>
<i>all my life.</i>

158
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,189
<i>I'm going. I'm really going.</i>

159
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,755
<i>I've finally taken a step.</i>

160
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:15,274
<i>By now they know the car is gone...</i>

161
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:18,045
<i>but they don't know where.</i>

162
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:21,545
<i>They would never have suspected it of me.</i>

163
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:24,917
<i>I would never have suspected it of myself.</i>

164
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,048
<i>I'm a new person.</i>

165
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,635
<i>Someday...</i>

166
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,541
<i>Someday I'll have an apartment</i>
<i>of my own...</i>

167
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:53,912
<i>in a house with a pair of stone lions</i>
<i>guarding the gate.</i>

168
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:59,015
<i>I might just stop anywhere</i>
<i>and never leave again.</i>

169
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:01,782
<i>Or I might drive on and on...</i>

170
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:04,724
<i>until the wheels of the car</i>
<i>are worn to nothing...</i>

171
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:07,888
<i>and I've come to the end of the world.</i>

172
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,756
<i>I wonder if all homeless people</i>
<i>feel that way.</i>

173
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:15,769
<i>I wonder what Dr. Markway is like.</i>

174
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:19,137
<i>I wonder who else will be there.</i>

175
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:22,609
<i>I wonder what Hill House is like.</i>

176
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:56,935
- What do you want?
- I want to come in, please.

177
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,007
- Please unlock the gates.
- Who says?

178
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,850
I'm supposed to come in. I'm expected.

179
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,046
- Who by?
- Dr. Markway.

180
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,181
- You better come back later.
- Please.

181
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:10,987
I'm one of Dr. Markway's guests.

182
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,029
He's expecting me in the house.
Please listen to me.

183
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:15,996
He can't rightly be expecting you...

184
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:18,966
seeing as you're
the only one who's come so far.

185
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:22,464
Do you mean that
there's no one in the house?

186
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:24,301
No one you'd want to see.

187
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:29,502
- What did you say your name was?
- Eleanor Lance...

188
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:31,671
and I am expected in Hill House.

189
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:34,443
- Unlock those gates at once.
- All right.

190
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,116
Suppose you know what you're asking for
coming here.

191
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,886
Suppose they told you, back in the city.

192
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:04,838
You seem to be the one who's afraid.

193
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,148
You'll be sorry I ever opened the gate.

194
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,183
Out of the way, please.
You've held me up long enough.

195
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:14,154
- Are you Dudley, the caretaker?
- I'm Dudley, the caretaker.

196
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,815
I shall report you.

197
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,086
Think they can find anyone else
to stay here?

198
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,186
Think we can't have things
the way we want, me and the wife...

199
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:23,493
as long as we stay around here,
see to the house...

200
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,659
for all you city people
think you know everything?

201
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,200
<i>It's staring at me.</i>

202
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,572
<i>Vile.</i>

203
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,717
<i>Get away from here. Get away at once.</i>

204
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:21,353
<i>It's my chance.</i>
<i>I'm being given a last chance.</i>

205
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:23,989
<i>I could turn my car around</i>
<i>and go away from here...</i>

206
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:27,551
<i>and no one would blame me.</i>
<i>Anyone has a right to run away.</i>

207
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:31,188
<i>But you are running away, Eleanor...</i>

208
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,895
<i>and there's nowhere else to go.</i>

209
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:18,102
<i>It's waiting for me.</i>

210
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:21,541
<i>Evil, patient...</i>

211
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:23,246
<i>waiting.</i>

212
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:47,169
Mrs. Dudley?

213
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:50,975
I'm Eleanor Lance. I'm expected.

214
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,603
Can you take me to my room?

215
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,895
I gather I'm the first one here,
Mrs. Dudley.

216
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,788
You did say you were Mrs. Dudley?
I met your...

217
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:55,474
<i>Talk about being scared</i>
<i>of your own shadow.</i>

218
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:57,878
<i>Pull yourself together.</i>

219
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,208
Here.

220
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,151
This is your room.

221
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:15,124
How nice.

222
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:17,964
I can't keep the rooms the way I'd like...

223
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:21,298
but there's no one else they could get
that would help me.

224
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,794
How very nice.

225
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,131
I set dinner
on the dining room sideboard at 6:00.

226
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:28,904
I clear up in the morning.

227
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:32,538
I have breakfast for you at 9:00.
I don't wait on people.

228
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:35,478
I don't stay after I set out the dinner.

229
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:37,916
Not after it begins to get dark.

230
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:40,478
I leave before the dark comes.

231
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:44,115
- Your husband?
- We live over in town, miles away.

232
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,623
So there won't be anyone around
if you need help.

233
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:47,821
I understand.

234
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:50,421
We couldn't hear you... in the night.

235
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,996
- Do you have any idea when...
- No one could.

236
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:56,496
No one lives any nearer than town.

237
00:20:57,272 --> 00:20:59,797
No one will come any nearer than that...

238
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,069
I know.

239
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,670
...in the night, in the dark.

240
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,201
<i>I'm like a small creature</i>
<i>swallowed whole by a monster...</i>

241
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:38,737
<i>and the monster</i>
<i>feels my tiny movements inside.</i>

242
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,513
<i>Now, Eleanor Lance, you just stop it.</i>

243
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,321
There's no one else they could get.
I set dinner on the...

244
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:27,624
Thank heavens somebody's here.

245
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,989
My name's Eleanor Lance.
I'm so glad you're here.

246
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:33,193
I'm Theodora. Just Theodora.

247
00:22:33,468 --> 00:22:35,060
What about this crazy house?

248
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:37,469
I'm right next door.
We have a connecting bath.

249
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:39,404
This used to be
the embalming room, I bet.

250
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:40,839
It was terrible being here alone.

251
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:42,774
I set dinner on the sideboard at 6:00...

252
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:45,039
Where's Markway?
I thought he'd be here first.

253
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,978
Serve yourselves.
I clear up in the morning.

254
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:49,643
- Have you known Dr. Markway long?
- Breakfast is at 9:00.

255
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:52,778
- I've never met him.
- I don't stay after 6:00, when it gets dark.

256
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:57,450
Our only contact is our correspondence
about the "experiment."

257
00:22:57,526 --> 00:22:58,959
I leave before the dark comes.

258
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:02,190
So there won't be anyone around
if you need help.

259
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:05,463
No one can hear you
if you scream in the night.

260
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:07,365
Isn't that so, Mrs. Dudley?

261
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:10,103
No one lives any nearer than town.

262
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:13,368
No one will come any nearer than that...

263
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:15,933
in the night... in the dark.

264
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,816
- You're frightened, Nell.
- No more.

265
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:27,881
Just when I thought I was all alone.

266
00:23:28,356 --> 00:23:30,483
But how did you know
my nickname is Nell?

267
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,426
That is the affectionate term
for Eleanor, isn't it?

268
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,656
Yes, I suppose it is.

269
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:38,599
What a nice way of putting it.

270
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,329
The affectionate term
for Theodora is Theo.

271
00:23:43,205 --> 00:23:45,571
We're going to be great friends, Theo.

272
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,107
Like sisters?

273
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:50,536
There's no need
to hang around our rooms.

274
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:52,477
- Let's go exploring.
- I'd like to.

275
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:56,415
Why don't you put on one of your
new things? Something that'll stand out.

276
00:23:56,485 --> 00:24:00,319
I think it's a good idea around here
to always remain strictly visible.

277
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,285
Be ready in a jiffy.

278
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,320
How did you know I brought new clothes?

279
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:07,987
You wear your thoughts on your sleeve.

280
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:10,327
Anyway, that's better than my heart.

281
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,647
<i>How did I get into this? Why am I here?</i>

282
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:29,641
<i>What nightmares are waiting?</i>

283
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,677
Damn it! I still say one of these doors
should lead to the main hall.

284
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:35,780
Any lights near you, Nell?

285
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:41,755
It helps if you make a game of it.

286
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,923
Pretend this is hide-and-seek.

287
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:45,626
But we're still lost.

288
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,258
Yes.

289
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:51,263
That passageway.
We haven't tried that one yet.

290
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,202
What's the matter?

291
00:24:55,343 --> 00:24:57,368
There's something with us.

292
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:01,011
I don't see anything.

293
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:03,050
- Can't you feel it?
- No.

294
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:06,210
I feel a chill.

295
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:10,054
- It's moving.
- It's just the air rushing past our ears.

296
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:13,187
Then who?

297
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:16,386
What?

298
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:20,460
The house, it's alive.

299
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:30,974
<i>She didn't hear that.</i>

300
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,013
<i>Nobody heard it but me.</i>

301
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,648
It wants you, Nell.

302
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:42,687
The house is calling you.

303
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:54,659
<i>I've waited such a long time.</i>
<i>Is this what I came so far to find?</i>

304
00:25:59,107 --> 00:26:02,270
Don't let me go! Theo, stay with me!

305
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:07,811
You won't believe this,
but five minutes ago I left this door open...

306
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:10,976
so you could find your way.
It closed by itself.

307
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:14,211
Welcome to Hill House. I'm Dr. Markway.

308
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:18,248
Thank goodness.
I thought you might be a ghost.

309
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,762
- How do you know I'm not?
- Don't be ghoulish.

310
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,630
You mustn't confuse ghoulish and ghostly.

311
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:27,566
The word "ghoulish" is used to describe
a feeling of horror...

312
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:29,536
often accompanied by intense cold.

313
00:26:29,604 --> 00:26:32,004
It has nothing to do with ghosts.
Ghosts are visible.

314
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:35,736
- Enough of that. Get us out of here fast.
- What's the matter?

315
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,006
Let's just say we're scared of the dark.

316
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,708
I, too, go in mortal terror of the dark.

317
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,842
- I'm Theodora.
- You must be Eleanor.

318
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,545
I'm unsure at the moment.

319
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:49,783
If it turns out you're not,
I'll be disappointed.

320
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,086
All right.

321
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:55,288
It's Theo who's wearing velvet,
so I must be Eleanor in tweed.

322
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:56,395
Good.

323
00:26:56,464 --> 00:26:59,490
Follow me through
the uncharted waste of Hill House.

324
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,194
Dinner's waiting.

325
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,771
- Do you like it?
- Lovely. What do you call this?

326
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:10,504
The Purple Parlor.

327
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,704
We're going to use this
as the operating room.

328
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:16,984
I mean the center of operations.

329
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,520
- It's not very cheerful.
- I don't know.

330
00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:22,021
There's nothing more cozy
than an old gargoyle...

331
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,081
except maybe a whipping post or two.

332
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,957
This house does have its little oddities.

333
00:27:27,262 --> 00:27:29,560
The man who built it was a misfit...

334
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:32,623
who hated people
and their conventional ideas.

335
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:35,226
He built his house to suit his mind.

336
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:39,430
For instance, all the doors
are hung slightly off-center.

337
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:42,742
Probably explains why
they keep swinging shut by themselves.

338
00:27:42,811 --> 00:27:44,005
Watch.

339
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,770
Now watch this.

340
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:54,382
What did I tell you?

341
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,826
Anyway, all the angles are slightly off.
There isn't a square corner in the place.

342
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:02,829
No wonder it's impossible
to find your way around.

343
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:05,491
Add up all these wrong angles...

344
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:08,536
and you get one big distortion
in the house as a whole.

345
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,037
Clever, Eleanor. You catch on fast.

346
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,171
I'm hungry.

347
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,034
Let's go.

348
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:17,834
Sorry. In the psychic world
we're apt to forget...

349
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:21,712
that food is still the main concern
of poor old homo sapiens.

350
00:28:22,183 --> 00:28:24,447
You see? Closed by itself.

351
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:28,918
To the right, ladies.

352
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:38,260
Now, which door?

353
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:42,035
- That one.
- Wrong.

354
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:44,264
I've studied a map, it's this one.

355
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:50,366
- This proves it, one of you is a witch.
- A broom closet.

356
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:53,175
If you can't find your way around,
how will we ever?

357
00:28:53,248 --> 00:28:56,945
All these doors, it makes me think
of the lady and the tiger.

358
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:59,748
Let's see if there's a tiger behind this one.

359
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:09,157
That's funny.

360
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,325
- No tiger?
- Listen.

361
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:23,374
What's wrong? Too much vermouth?

362
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,202
Nothing that serious...

363
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,376
and, please,
no cracks about my passion for spirits.

364
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,381
If you two
are the ghostly inhabitants of Hill House...

365
00:29:33,455 --> 00:29:35,480
I must confess I'm glad I came.

366
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:38,816
It has taken 60 million years...

367
00:29:38,893 --> 00:29:41,794
to develop the carnivorous biped
you see before you.

368
00:29:41,996 --> 00:29:43,020
Luke Sannerson.

369
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:45,258
Let's see what kind of martinis it makes.

370
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:48,632
They should be pretty good.
I majored in them at college.

371
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:52,070
Are we to expect
any more carnivorous bipeds?

372
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:55,738
Originally, there were six committed
to the experiment...

373
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,675
but one by one the others dropped out.

374
00:29:57,745 --> 00:30:02,079
I suppose they were frightened by the
various unsavory stories about the house.

375
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:05,543
You're the only ones left.

376
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,314
What stories?

377
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,913
You didn't investigate
before you came here?

378
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:13,259
So much the better.

379
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:15,922
You should be innocent and receptive.

380
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,766
- So let's drink to our success.
- Success?

381
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:24,738
And just how do you reckon success
in a junket like this?

382
00:30:24,806 --> 00:30:26,569
I'd like to drink...

383
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:29,808
to just us, good companions.

384
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,406
Excellent.

385
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:34,172
To my new companion.

386
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,248
Except I don't drink.

387
00:30:45,424 --> 00:30:48,052
- I think I'll have some more salmon.
- Palissy.

388
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:50,461
- Yeah? How much is it worth?
- Plenty.

389
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:53,293
Haven't seen Palissy outside of a museum.

390
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:56,729
I'll take a pair of Kastle skis for them
any day of the week.

391
00:30:56,802 --> 00:30:59,498
I wonder how much I'll get
for this New England fossil.

392
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:03,974
Don't let Mrs. Dudley hear you saying that.
At the moment she's giving us the best.

393
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:08,240
I'm a simple fellow myself,
easily satisfied by the best of everything.

394
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:10,781
Including, I hope,
some startling events to come.

395
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:13,682
Exactly what do you
expect to happen, Dr. Markway?

396
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:16,418
Yes, what is the matter with Hill House?

397
00:31:16,588 --> 00:31:19,056
What's going to happen?
Why are we here?

398
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:25,319
Like so many people through the ages,
I've been intrigued by the supernatural...

399
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:28,264
or rather
the possibility of the supernatural.

400
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:31,258
I'm here in hopes of proving its existence.

401
00:31:31,336 --> 00:31:34,737
You're here to keep track and take notes
for an authenticated record.

402
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:37,274
- Okay. But why us?
- It's no accident.

403
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:41,373
You're what's left of a select company
chosen with great care.

404
00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:43,676
I combed the records
of psychic societies...

405
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:47,275
the back numbers of newspapers,
reports of parapsychologists...

406
00:31:47,352 --> 00:31:51,379
hoping to find people who've been touched
in some way by the supernatural.

407
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:55,490
It's my belief that the very presence
of people like yourselves in this house...

408
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,791
will help to stimulate
the strange forces at work here.

409
00:31:58,864 --> 00:32:01,298
Charming thought, to be used as live bait.

410
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:04,460
I'm here because
I'm a wolf in ghost's clothing.

411
00:32:04,703 --> 00:32:07,797
I'm not really running
a psychic beauty contest.

412
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:09,738
You're here, Theo...

413
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:13,039
because of your remarkable powers
of extrasensory perception.

414
00:32:13,111 --> 00:32:15,875
ESP? Don't believe in it.

415
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:17,714
Theo's a champ.

416
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:21,377
Her name shines in the annals
of Duke University Psychic Lab...

417
00:32:21,453 --> 00:32:23,921
where she identified 19 out of 20 cards...

418
00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:26,389
held up out of sight and hearing.

419
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:30,991
But I've never had
anything to do with the supernatural.

420
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:34,361
Yes, you have, Eleanor.
Your poltergeist experience.

421
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:36,463
What's a poltergeist?

422
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:40,529
- A playful ghost, isn't that right, Nell?
- I wouldn't know.

423
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:43,764
According to the records
of the International Psychic Society...

424
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:47,801
showers of stones fell on your house for
three days when you were 10 years old.

425
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:49,540
That's ridiculous.

426
00:32:49,681 --> 00:32:51,672
It was witnessed by your family...

427
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,980
the neighbors, sightseers and the police.

428
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:57,249
In fact, it's the only case
ever officially recorded by the police.

429
00:32:57,322 --> 00:32:58,983
It never happened.

430
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,554
Perhaps not, if you say so.

431
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:05,323
I only mention it because that's
the reason I wanted you in Hill House.

432
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:06,728
Doc, level with us.

433
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:09,596
I mean, you're a college prof.
A man with a PhD.

434
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:13,134
You can't really believe
there's such a thing as a haunted house.

435
00:33:13,205 --> 00:33:16,800
I wish you'd stop referring
to this desirable property as haunted.

436
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,672
There's that word "haunted" again.

437
00:33:18,743 --> 00:33:22,270
Makes me expect to find
a disembodied hand in the sauce.

438
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,543
Nobody knows even
why some houses are called haunted.

439
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,444
What would you call this place?
Fun-o-rama?

440
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:32,290
Diseased, sick, crazy if you like.

441
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:36,618
A deranged house
isn't a bad way of putting it.

442
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:40,461
Your aunt thinks
that maybe Hill House was born bad.

443
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:44,129
Such houses are described in the Bible
as leprous.

444
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:46,693
Or before that,
in Homer's phrase for the underworld:

445
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:48,398
A house of Hades.

446
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,339
Come off it, Doc.

447
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:53,241
Really, the local mayor
makes more sense to me.

448
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:56,378
He says the disturbances
are caused by subterranean waters...

449
00:33:56,448 --> 00:34:00,748
electric currents, atmospheric pressure,
sunspots, earth tremors, et cetera.

450
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:03,583
Sure, people always want to put
an easy label on things...

451
00:34:03,655 --> 00:34:05,088
even if it's meaningless.

452
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:07,420
"The trouble with Hill House is sunspots."

453
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:10,188
There's an explanation
you don't have to think twice about.

454
00:34:10,262 --> 00:34:12,958
And it has a scientific ring.

455
00:34:13,031 --> 00:34:15,363
That was the neighbors.
They threw the rocks.

456
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:18,732
Mother says they were against us
because she wouldn't mix with them.

457
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:20,270
Mother says...

458
00:34:24,009 --> 00:34:24,998
Oh, dear.

459
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:28,836
That's all right, Eleanor.

460
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:31,572
- Go on. What does your mother say?
- Nothing.

461
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:35,776
I must be more tired than I thought.

462
00:34:36,288 --> 00:34:38,518
My mother died two months ago.

463
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:41,291
You weren't sorry when it happened...

464
00:34:42,294 --> 00:34:43,283
were you?

465
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:46,254
No, she wasn't very happy.

466
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,692
Then I won't say I'm sorry now.

467
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:52,802
If I'd known,
I'd never have asked you to come here.

468
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:55,339
But I'm grateful you did. I had to get away.

469
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:58,843
- Perhaps you should...
- Please, let's talk about something else.

470
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,372
Oh, dear.

471
00:35:03,648 --> 00:35:05,878
Doc, see that? Now what about that?

472
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,544
Does salt work against the supernatural?

473
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:12,420
The Montusi bushmen thought so,
but they're extinct.

474
00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:16,057
You see, you haven't a ghost of a chance.

475
00:35:25,837 --> 00:35:27,964
<i>I have a place in this room.</i>

476
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:30,533
<i>These people are my friends.</i>

477
00:35:30,975 --> 00:35:34,274
<i>I'm one of them. I belong.</i>

478
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:38,842
Gin!

479
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:42,409
- That's the fifth time, five times in a row.
- $12, please.

480
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:44,717
- I hope your skirt isn't stained.
- That's all right.

481
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:46,586
But the upholstery on the couch.

482
00:35:46,658 --> 00:35:47,590
I've cleanser upstairs.

483
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:49,923
- Do you think I'm a sucker?
- Pay up. Cash on the line.

484
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:52,758
Over my dead body.
You knew every card I had in my hand.

485
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:56,096
- There's a name for that.
- If you mean cheating, I don't have to.

486
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:58,397
Okay, Miss ESP,
go dream yourself up the $12.

487
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,496
Pay up, you welsher!
I won fair and I want my money.

488
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:08,475
- What was it?
- I had a feeling.

489
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:13,379
- I'm sure it was just my imagination.
- A feeling you were being watched?

490
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:15,049
Yes, I did.

491
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,520
The house.
It watches every move we make.

492
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:21,252
- That's your imagination.
- Don't be so cocksure of everything.

493
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:25,057
A closed mind is the worst defense
against the supernatural.

494
00:36:25,363 --> 00:36:29,595
You think you're too civilized to need
to protect yourself against evil spirits.

495
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:33,865
But even prehistoric man had a dozen
practical methods of warding them off.

496
00:36:33,938 --> 00:36:36,133
Some of your theories
strike me as prehistoric.

497
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:38,437
Besides, they downgrade property values.

498
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,707
I know the supernatural is something
that isn't supposed to happen.

499
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,247
Yet it does happen.

500
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:47,478
Ghosts make the papers along
with celebrities every day of the week.

501
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:49,480
If it happens to you...

502
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:52,550
you're liable to have
that shut door in your mind...

503
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:54,285
ripped right off its hinges.

504
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:57,522
Look, Doc, we're buddies,
but don't try to convert me.

505
00:36:57,595 --> 00:36:59,620
I'm trying to prepare you.

506
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:04,561
There's something going on in this house
or I wouldn't be here.

507
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:05,728
What?

508
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:11,865
Don't ask me to give a name
to something which hasn't got a name.

509
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:14,734
I don't know.

510
00:37:18,316 --> 00:37:21,217
Tomorrow we'll see all the place.
Now let's go to bed.

511
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:23,049
Unless anyone wants to clear out now...

512
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:25,351
and not have anything more to do
with Hill House.

513
00:37:25,423 --> 00:37:28,290
I hope to have plenty
to do with it someday, moneywise.

514
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:30,554
We couldn't leave now
even if we wanted to.

515
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:34,359
- You mean I'm holding you prisoner?
- I mean Dudley keeps the gates locked.

516
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:36,457
We could always break out.

517
00:37:36,935 --> 00:37:39,870
I have a key to the gate
anytime you want it.

518
00:37:40,004 --> 00:37:42,632
- I wouldn't dream of leaving.
- Thank you.

519
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:44,833
Adventurers all.

520
00:37:45,577 --> 00:37:48,205
But you mustn't expect every night
to be Halloween.

521
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:50,873
Psychic phenomena
are subject to certain laws.

522
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:52,814
And just what are these laws?

523
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:55,409
You won't know until you break them.

524
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:59,680
At the end of each day, you have to fill
out these forms I've had mimeographed.

525
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:01,349
Very scientific, aren't we?

526
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:04,259
The really scientific phase
won't start for a while yet.

527
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:06,661
First of all, we have to get orientated.

528
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:09,097
What's this? Looks like "psy-kookiness."

529
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,930
Nothing like that wrong with me.

530
00:38:11,002 --> 00:38:13,197
Psychokinesis is just the technical form...

531
00:38:13,271 --> 00:38:15,705
for what you'd call
objects moving by themselves.

532
00:38:15,773 --> 00:38:17,172
Actually, they don't...

533
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:21,372
but are moved by a force from somewhere
which we call psychokinesis.

534
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:24,841
I see.

535
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,048
About this ghost
I can expect in my room tonight...

536
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,314
tell me, is it male or female?

537
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,258
Good night, ladies, Doc.

538
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:39,856
I just thought of something.
Nobody locked the front door.

539
00:38:40,131 --> 00:38:42,156
Won't make any difference.

540
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:44,126
I see.

541
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:48,863
- Good night, Dr. Markway.
- John.

542
00:38:49,607 --> 00:38:53,065
Good night, Theo.
Get a good rest, Eleanor. Sleep well.

543
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:57,545
I'll turn the lights off below,
in case you wonder who did it.

544
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,847
If you feel in the least bit nervous,
just run right into my room.

545
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,649
Thanks. Good night.

546
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:06,113
I'll come in for a second.

547
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:09,886
You've been thinking of changing
your hair. I know just the style for you.

548
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:13,226
Why, yes. I was. But I'm awfully tired.

549
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:17,289
- Thanks anyhow.
- Okay. We have a date for breakfast.

550
00:39:17,902 --> 00:39:19,529
Good night, Theo.

551
00:39:43,962 --> 00:39:47,022
<i>Funny. Everything's so ugly</i>
<i>and yet so comfortable.</i>

552
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,900
<i>Like drowning, I guess.</i>

553
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:58,640
<i>Now I can think about them. I'm all alone.</i>

554
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:03,007
<i>Alone.</i>

555
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:16,684
<i>He won't know I locked it.</i>

556
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:20,525
<i>Against what, Eleanor?</i>

557
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:52,123
All right, Mother.

558
00:40:57,001 --> 00:40:59,026
Just a minute. I'm coming.

559
00:41:07,712 --> 00:41:09,976
What, Theo?

560
00:41:10,048 --> 00:41:11,709
Nell, in here!

561
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,349
I'm here. What is it?

562
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:22,985
I thought it was you pounding.

563
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:25,427
It was. I mean, I did.

564
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:29,660
But now it's down
near the other end of the hall.

565
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,533
<i>It's not at all like Mother</i>
<i>knocking on the wall.</i>

566
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:40,071
<i>It's only a noise,</i>
<i>and the room is terribly cold.</i>

567
00:41:40,978 --> 00:41:42,946
<i>Terribly, terribly cold.</i>

568
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:47,011
It must be Luke and Dr. Markway.

569
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:49,445
Why should they be knocking
on the walls?

570
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,387
Something is. Anyway, it's only a noise.

571
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:54,147
Earth tremors?

572
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:15,906
Maybe it'll go down
on the other side of the hall.

573
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

574
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,741
- No!
- Go away!

575
00:43:01,692 --> 00:43:03,284
<i>Now I've done it.</i>

576
00:43:03,427 --> 00:43:06,521
<i>It was looking for the room</i>
<i>with someone inside.</i>

577
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:15,538
You big baby.

578
00:43:16,808 --> 00:43:19,242
Whatever it is, it's just a noise.

579
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:21,641
- I'm cold.
- So am I.

580
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:25,682
- Where's Luke? Where's Markway?
- I don't know.

581
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,342
- Warmer now?
- No.

582
00:43:28,152 --> 00:43:30,814
In a minute
I'll go out in the hall and call them.

583
00:43:30,888 --> 00:43:32,549
Are you all right?

584
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,187
Oh, God, Nell!

585
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:39,556
It's against the top of the door!

586
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:55,407
<i>It's found us.</i>

587
00:43:56,447 --> 00:44:00,144
<i>Now I know why people scream,</i>
<i>because I think I'm going to.</i>

588
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,349
Is the door locked?

589
00:44:45,863 --> 00:44:47,490
You can't get in!

590
00:45:20,031 --> 00:45:21,191
It's over.

591
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:25,058
- How do you know?
- Can't you feel it?

592
00:45:25,436 --> 00:45:28,564
Aren't you warm again?
That terrible cold has gone.

593
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,234
Why, yes.

594
00:45:31,175 --> 00:45:35,111
Intense cold is one of the symptoms
of shock. My mother...

595
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:38,171
Intense shock
is one of the symptoms I've got.

596
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:47,553
Where have you two been?

597
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:50,059
What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

598
00:45:50,127 --> 00:45:51,822
Did anything happen?

599
00:46:05,443 --> 00:46:07,308
Nothing in particular...

600
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,174
just something knocked on the door
with a cannonball...

601
00:46:13,484 --> 00:46:15,247
then tried to get in and eat us.

602
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:16,809
I'm with Nell.

603
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:20,822
Miss ESP and Bridey Murphy,
some combination.

604
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:23,992
- There isn't a scratch on the wood.
- Or anywhere else.

605
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:26,552
How nice, it didn't mar the woodwork.

606
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:31,660
Where were you, Dr. Markway?

607
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:33,526
Chasing a dog.

608
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:36,372
At least, we assumed it was a dog.

609
00:46:36,507 --> 00:46:38,407
We followed it outside.

610
00:46:40,911 --> 00:46:42,640
You mean it was inside?

611
00:46:42,713 --> 00:46:45,113
I thought I heard something
run past my room.

612
00:46:45,182 --> 00:46:47,946
I woke Luke. We went looking for it
all over the house...

613
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:49,452
and finally out in the garden.

614
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,819
But let's face it, girls,
we didn't get very far from the house.

615
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,552
Then you must've heard
that ungodly noise.

616
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,495
No, there wasn't a sound from the house.

617
00:47:00,131 --> 00:47:02,463
At least, nothing audible to us.

618
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:09,505
- We'd better take precautions.
- Against what?

619
00:47:10,307 --> 00:47:13,140
When Luke and I are decoyed outside...

620
00:47:13,911 --> 00:47:16,311
and you two are bottled up inside...

621
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,510
wouldn't you say that something,
somehow, is trying to separate us?

622
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:48,769
Good morning, Dr. Markway.

623
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:51,746
'Morning, and please call me John.

624
00:47:53,717 --> 00:47:57,175
- This curious life seems to agree with you.
- Thank you.

625
00:47:57,321 --> 00:47:59,312
- Tea or coffee?
- Tea, please.

626
00:47:59,723 --> 00:48:01,918
How is it you look so pretty
after last night?

627
00:48:01,992 --> 00:48:03,755
That was last night.

628
00:48:03,928 --> 00:48:06,089
There may have been a little noise.

629
00:48:07,264 --> 00:48:09,960
One has to expect that
in these old houses.

630
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:13,200
I give up. I was sure you'd be packed
and on your way.

631
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:14,259
Not likely.

632
00:48:14,338 --> 00:48:17,273
This is my first vacation in years
and I'm going to enjoy it.

633
00:48:17,341 --> 00:48:20,799
That's the point. You need a real vacation.
This isn't the place for one.

634
00:48:20,878 --> 00:48:22,778
I mean to stay. Period.

635
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,578
Unless, of course,
you want to get rid of me.

636
00:48:25,649 --> 00:48:27,514
No, you mustn't think that.

637
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:31,179
Till last night
you were just a name on my list.

638
00:48:31,255 --> 00:48:33,416
I scarcely know Eleanor Lance.

639
00:48:33,491 --> 00:48:36,085
- She's horrible.
- No, you mustn't make fun of me.

640
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,993
You're sweet and pleasant
and everyone likes you very much.

641
00:48:39,063 --> 00:48:41,293
I want to know more about you.

642
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:45,729
I dislike lobster,
crack my knuckles when I'm nervous...

643
00:48:47,037 --> 00:48:49,767
save buttons, and sleep on my left side.

644
00:48:50,508 --> 00:48:52,271
Why on the left side?

645
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:55,506
I read someplace
it wears the heart out quicker.

646
00:48:56,514 --> 00:48:58,641
That's a depressing thought.

647
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:03,310
For the past 11 years I've been
walled up alive on a desert island.

648
00:49:03,387 --> 00:49:06,845
I thought you might be hiding
some dark romantic secret in your past.

649
00:49:06,924 --> 00:49:08,186
Romantic?

650
00:49:09,326 --> 00:49:12,853
I've spent all my adult life
taking care of my invalid mother...

651
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:14,854
until she died.

652
00:49:15,032 --> 00:49:16,932
No, it wasn't romantic.

653
00:49:17,535 --> 00:49:21,494
Now that you're free at last, you shouldn't
be wasting your time in Hill House.

654
00:49:21,572 --> 00:49:24,006
- It's a mistake.
- But it isn't, don't you see?

655
00:49:24,074 --> 00:49:26,304
The only thing that kept me going...

656
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:28,839
was that someday
I knew something would happen.

657
00:49:28,913 --> 00:49:32,349
Something truly extraordinary,
like Hill House.

658
00:49:33,584 --> 00:49:35,552
Yes, it's extraordinary.

659
00:49:36,353 --> 00:49:38,685
What'll you do when you get back?
Do you have a job?

660
00:49:38,756 --> 00:49:41,987
No job, nothing.
I don't know what I'm going to do.

661
00:49:43,494 --> 00:49:45,928
You wouldn't send me back, would you?

662
00:49:45,996 --> 00:49:47,964
That depends on what happens.

663
00:49:48,933 --> 00:49:51,026
We may all have to go back.

664
00:49:51,135 --> 00:49:52,625
But I won't give up easily.

665
00:49:52,703 --> 00:49:55,900
How did you get so interested
in the supernatural?

666
00:49:56,407 --> 00:50:00,309
I didn't want to become
what my father called a practical man.

667
00:50:01,011 --> 00:50:04,276
I come from one of those
respectable English families...

668
00:50:04,348 --> 00:50:07,283
that dragged all the Victorian virtues
into the 20th century.

669
00:50:07,351 --> 00:50:09,319
In a Gladstone bag, of course.

670
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:11,980
Everything had to be practical
and conventional.

671
00:50:12,056 --> 00:50:13,614
So my first reaction as a kid...

672
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:16,717
was to choose something useless
and unconventional. Like ghosts.

673
00:50:16,794 --> 00:50:18,921
But you're an anthropologist now.

674
00:50:19,296 --> 00:50:22,356
When I refused to read law at Oxford
as my father had...

675
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:24,162
there was a terrific row.

676
00:50:24,335 --> 00:50:27,133
I took off for America,
without my Gladstone bag...

677
00:50:27,204 --> 00:50:29,172
and worked my way through college.

678
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,367
I decided on anthropology
because it seemed...

679
00:50:31,442 --> 00:50:33,774
to be a short step
from the study of dead souls...

680
00:50:33,844 --> 00:50:36,938
to the study of dead men
and dead civilizations.

681
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:39,005
I'm not very practical, either.

682
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,816
But it didn't occur to me
till I was hooked...

683
00:50:41,885 --> 00:50:45,150
that my combined knowledge
of anthropology and psychic phenomena...

684
00:50:45,222 --> 00:50:47,690
had led me on to something very practical.

685
00:50:47,891 --> 00:50:51,349
You see, if ghosts,
which are pure spirit, come from man...

686
00:50:51,428 --> 00:50:54,659
then perhaps it's possible some day
to have individuals...

687
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:59,164
whose spiritual caliber far surpasses
anything humanity has yet known.

688
00:50:59,503 --> 00:51:02,165
Human nature could certainly stand
some improvements.

689
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:04,969
However, my idea remains pure theory...

690
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:08,375
until somebody proves definitely
the supernatural exists.

691
00:51:09,213 --> 00:51:12,546
Anyway, that's enough about me.
Now tell me about last night.

692
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:14,175
Thank you.

693
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:16,515
I've been trying to remember.

694
00:51:16,587 --> 00:51:19,317
I can remember
knowing I was frightened...

695
00:51:19,657 --> 00:51:23,354
but I can't remember
actually being frightened, or how I felt.

696
00:51:23,694 --> 00:51:25,685
I think it's because it was so unreal.

697
00:51:25,763 --> 00:51:28,664
Still could be subterranean waters,
you know.

698
00:51:28,732 --> 00:51:31,826
I hope not.
That wouldn't be nearly so exciting.

699
00:51:32,336 --> 00:51:34,930
Not good, this feeling of excitement.

700
00:51:35,472 --> 00:51:39,374
It's the first sign
you've fallen under the spell of the house.

701
00:51:39,777 --> 00:51:41,972
Maybe it isn't just the house.

702
00:51:42,513 --> 00:51:44,037
Then what else?

703
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:48,810
Let's blame it on sunspots.

704
00:51:50,087 --> 00:51:52,419
Well, it wasn't sunspots last night.

705
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:56,719
If anyone gets hurt,
it's going to be your fault, Markway.

706
00:51:57,361 --> 00:52:01,320
No ghost in all the long history of ghosts
ever hurt anyone physically.

707
00:52:01,398 --> 00:52:04,595
We weren't in any actual danger at all,
isn't that right, John?

708
00:52:04,668 --> 00:52:05,965
No, not entirely.

709
00:52:06,036 --> 00:52:08,266
Fear alone can do the damage
to the victim.

710
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:11,570
Prehistoric man, for instance,
could die of fright during an eclipse.

711
00:52:11,642 --> 00:52:14,372
- Poor sap.
- You mean poor homo sapiens.

712
00:52:15,779 --> 00:52:18,976
A modern man can react
with the same unreasoning terror...

713
00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:20,448
to a supernatural event.

714
00:52:20,517 --> 00:52:23,384
Especially if he doesn't believe
that the supernatural exists.

715
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:26,753
I've always been more afraid
of being left alone or left out...

716
00:52:26,824 --> 00:52:29,418
than of things that go bump in the night.

717
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:32,285
What are you afraid of, Theo?

718
00:52:32,663 --> 00:52:34,893
Of knowing what I really want.

719
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:40,194
- Good morning, fellow earthlings.
- Luke, what are you afraid of?

720
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,397
What I just saw in the hall.

721
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,766
- Is there something?
- You mean you haven't seen it?

722
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:49,301
The show's just getting good. Come on.

723
00:52:55,052 --> 00:52:56,178
Right here.

724
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:00,356
It's writing?

725
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:01,985
Writing.

726
00:53:05,229 --> 00:53:06,389
Chalk.

727
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:10,728
Or something like chalk.

728
00:53:21,044 --> 00:53:22,841
- Can you read it?
- No.

729
00:53:31,388 --> 00:53:32,480
What?

730
00:53:35,225 --> 00:53:36,522
No.

731
00:53:36,994 --> 00:53:40,088
Wipe it off, please. It's crazy.

732
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:42,532
Crazy is the word for it, all right.

733
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:45,864
- Get something and wipe it off, Luke.
- But it's crazy. Why?

734
00:53:45,936 --> 00:53:48,564
Why all the fuss?
It spelled her name right, didn't it?

735
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:50,903
- Those letters spelled out my name.
- Take it easy.

736
00:53:50,974 --> 00:53:54,501
It's my name!
It belongs to me and something is using it.

737
00:53:54,578 --> 00:53:56,603
Writing it and calling me
with my own name!

738
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,773
- Just because your name...
- That's it!

739
00:53:58,849 --> 00:54:01,044
It knows my name, doesn't it?

740
00:54:01,185 --> 00:54:03,585
- It knows my name!
- Simmer down, Nell.

741
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:06,248
It could have said any of us.
It knows all our names.

742
00:54:06,323 --> 00:54:09,520
Did you write it? Please tell me.
I won't be angry or anything.

743
00:54:09,593 --> 00:54:11,857
I just want to know so that...

744
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:14,557
Maybe it was only for a joke
to frighten me.

745
00:54:14,998 --> 00:54:17,193
You know none of us wrote it, baby.

746
00:54:17,267 --> 00:54:19,565
- She's lying, I could swear she did it.
- Easy.

747
00:54:19,636 --> 00:54:21,365
I clear breakfast at 10:00.

748
00:54:21,438 --> 00:54:23,998
- Why should I write your name?
- I set lunch at 1:00.

749
00:54:24,074 --> 00:54:26,133
Because I didn't wait
to have breakfast with you.

750
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:28,838
- You're way out.
- You don't know Theo as I'm beginning to.

751
00:54:28,912 --> 00:54:31,472
- I clear up at 10:00.
- Mrs. Dudley, please!

752
00:54:31,782 --> 00:54:34,478
- No one blames you for being upset.
- It's 10:00.

753
00:54:34,551 --> 00:54:36,917
Why me? Why should I be the one chosen?

754
00:54:36,987 --> 00:54:39,478
Maybe something in the house
finds you a kindred spirit.

755
00:54:39,556 --> 00:54:43,253
Maybe it thinks you have more
understanding and sympathy than we do.

756
00:54:43,727 --> 00:54:45,524
Maybe you wrote it yourself.

757
00:54:45,596 --> 00:54:48,064
Sure, I'm just the kind
to want to see my name...

758
00:54:48,131 --> 00:54:51,999
- scribbled all over this foul house!
- It's one way to attract attention, isn't it?

759
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:54,765
You think I like the idea
I'm the center of attention?

760
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:57,830
Why are you all done up
in that new hairstyle?

761
00:55:01,278 --> 00:55:03,746
- You were the one who suggested...
- That's enough.

762
00:55:03,814 --> 00:55:05,372
How dare you?

763
00:55:05,449 --> 00:55:08,316
Can't you see Theo's just trying
to get a rise out of you...

764
00:55:08,385 --> 00:55:10,876
so you won't be frightened anymore?

765
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:14,821
I'm sorry.

766
00:55:15,225 --> 00:55:16,954
Take Eleanor to her room.

767
00:55:17,361 --> 00:55:19,352
We'll postpone the tour of the house.

768
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:22,887
Okay, but don't forget.
I don't want to spend another night...

769
00:55:22,966 --> 00:55:25,662
wondering what's over my head
or underneath me.

770
00:55:28,105 --> 00:55:30,505
You wouldn't leave me behind, would you?

771
00:55:30,841 --> 00:55:32,741
No one will leave you behind.

772
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:46,822
Holy cow! Mount Rushmore!

773
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:50,018
- It's not there. I don't believe it's there.
- How?

774
00:55:50,661 --> 00:55:52,424
I thought you'd get a kick out of it.

775
00:55:52,496 --> 00:55:55,363
It's supposed to be St. Francis
curing the lepers.

776
00:55:55,866 --> 00:55:57,857
I'd say it's a family portrait.

777
00:55:58,035 --> 00:55:59,195
A composite.

778
00:55:59,536 --> 00:56:02,198
The tall, draped, masculine type...

779
00:56:02,272 --> 00:56:04,433
that's old Hugh Crain...

780
00:56:04,508 --> 00:56:08,103
pointing out all the great treasures
in this creepy house he built.

781
00:56:08,178 --> 00:56:11,670
The dame on the end down there
and this one must be his two wives.

782
00:56:11,748 --> 00:56:13,648
His daughter, Abigail.

783
00:56:14,284 --> 00:56:17,185
- Now the dog...
- The dog you were chasing last night.

784
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:19,249
Yeah, very good.

785
00:56:20,324 --> 00:56:23,054
Now that one,
she's got to be the companion.

786
00:56:23,193 --> 00:56:25,889
The one who's supposed
to have murdered Abigail.

787
00:56:25,963 --> 00:56:28,989
No, that was much later.
When Abigail was an old lady.

788
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:33,462
I wonder how this statue got here.
It wasn't on the original inventory.

789
00:56:33,537 --> 00:56:35,698
Maybe I'll break it up
and sell it for tombstones.

790
00:56:35,772 --> 00:56:37,865
The companion reminds me of you, Nell.

791
00:56:37,941 --> 00:56:39,340
Oh, no!

792
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:40,975
She does at that.

793
00:56:41,712 --> 00:56:43,703
A natural beauty, I'd call her.

794
00:56:45,782 --> 00:56:47,875
<i>What does he think of me, really?</i>

795
00:56:48,352 --> 00:56:49,751
<i>Am I being a fool?</i>

796
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:53,984
<i>Don't let me know too surely</i>
<i>what he thinks of me.</i>

797
00:56:54,424 --> 00:56:56,722
This could be a family portrait of us.

798
00:56:56,793 --> 00:56:59,694
- Don't be ridiculous.
- You're the companion.

799
00:57:00,163 --> 00:57:02,495
I'm Abigail, grown up.

800
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:04,967
And Markway could be old Hugh.

801
00:57:05,235 --> 00:57:07,362
- Where do I fit in?
- The dog.

802
00:57:09,272 --> 00:57:11,433
When are you going to show me your ESP?

803
00:57:11,508 --> 00:57:13,203
Keep your hands to yourself.

804
00:57:13,276 --> 00:57:14,868
What's going on?

805
00:57:16,113 --> 00:57:17,808
More than meets the eye.

806
00:57:18,915 --> 00:57:22,942
You know, this wouldn't be
such a bad room without the statue.

807
00:57:23,387 --> 00:57:25,787
Ideal for the zombies' annual ball.

808
00:57:28,058 --> 00:57:31,050
Why don't you dance with Hugh?
I believe he has his eye on you.

809
00:57:31,128 --> 00:57:32,652
- That's not funny.
- Don't be chicken.

810
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:35,391
- Leave her alone.
- I bet she doesn't know how to dance.

811
00:57:35,465 --> 00:57:36,727
I do, too.

812
00:57:40,737 --> 00:57:43,297
Hugh Crain, will you dance with me?

813
00:57:44,608 --> 00:57:46,599
I believe he's going to accept.

814
00:58:00,524 --> 00:58:02,492
- He moved.
- Of course.

815
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,756
Haven't you noticed how nothing
in the house moves till you look away...

816
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:09,595
and then you just catch something
out of the corner of your eye?

817
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:13,460
She stepped on my toe.

818
00:58:14,604 --> 00:58:17,505
Let's go out this way
before somebody gets hurt.

819
00:58:21,378 --> 00:58:24,814
Come over here, I want to show you
something really unique.

820
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:36,390
A library complete with ivory tower.

821
00:58:38,462 --> 00:58:40,054
I can't go in there.

822
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:43,663
- My mother...
- Yes?

823
00:58:44,601 --> 00:58:45,829
That smell...

824
00:58:48,071 --> 00:58:51,700
- It's just stale air, Eleanor.
- No, that other smell... Awful.

825
00:58:52,876 --> 00:58:54,673
Smells sweet to me, honey.

826
00:58:54,811 --> 00:58:58,372
At 25 cents a book,
I should do all right with this room.

827
00:58:58,448 --> 00:59:01,849
I don't think I'll do much reading
while I'm here.

828
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:05,520
- Not if the books smell like the library.
- I didn't notice it.

829
00:59:06,123 --> 00:59:08,853
No, that's good, Eleanor.
It's just what we're after.

830
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:11,655
Try and remember your reaction
and describe it exactly...

831
00:59:11,728 --> 00:59:14,629
- when you write your notes tonight.
- That's what I'm here for.

832
00:59:14,698 --> 00:59:17,792
Only, do you mind
if I skip the library for now?

833
00:59:17,868 --> 00:59:20,928
No, do just what you want.
We'll only be a minute.

834
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:25,834
- You're sure you're all right?
- Yes.

835
00:59:32,315 --> 00:59:34,647
I want to show you something
really interesting.

836
00:59:34,718 --> 00:59:37,516
You remember that companion,
the one that Abigail had...

837
00:59:37,587 --> 00:59:40,454
when she was an old lady?
See that little balcony...

838
00:59:41,525 --> 00:59:44,688
clear up at the top there,
right up there in the shadows?

839
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:47,796
That's where the companion
hanged herself.

840
00:59:47,864 --> 00:59:50,492
- It would have been easier to jump.
- Without a parachute?

841
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:53,058
They say she tied the rope
on to the railing and then...

842
00:59:53,136 --> 00:59:54,797
Thanks, we get it.

843
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:56,495
I just had a great idea.

844
00:59:56,573 --> 01:00:00,441
You know what I'll do with this room?
After I inherit the house, of course.

845
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:02,239
I'll turn it into a nightclub.

846
01:00:02,312 --> 01:00:05,179
Tear out these bookshelves
and put a band in there.

847
01:00:06,316 --> 01:00:07,613
Now comes the best part.

848
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:10,517
A line of beautiful chorus girls
dancing down these stairs.

849
01:00:10,587 --> 01:00:11,952
Can't you see it?

850
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:18,919
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

851
01:00:18,995 --> 01:00:20,587
- Quick thinking.
- Instinct.

852
01:00:20,664 --> 01:00:23,326
My strong instinct for self-preservation.

853
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,359
And it's telling me right now
loud and clear to get the hell out of here.

854
01:00:37,214 --> 01:00:39,011
<i>Vile. Hideous.</i>

855
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,654
<i>I wonder what it would be like</i>
<i>looking down from there.</i>

856
01:00:54,497 --> 01:00:56,362
<i>That's where she did it.</i>

857
01:00:57,067 --> 01:00:58,466
<i>From that window.</i>

858
01:00:59,302 --> 01:01:01,566
<i>Climbing out through the bars...</i>

859
01:01:02,439 --> 01:01:06,603
<i>hanging on for an instant, hanging on...</i>

860
01:01:12,482 --> 01:01:14,279
Eleanor, you'll fall!

861
01:01:15,118 --> 01:01:16,915
Didn't you hear me calling?

862
01:01:17,387 --> 01:01:20,754
This house,
you have to watch it every minute.

863
01:01:25,028 --> 01:01:28,828
I didn't realize you were so nervous.
I think I should send you home.

864
01:01:28,899 --> 01:01:32,164
- No, please, I can't go home.
- It's no reflection on you.

865
01:01:32,235 --> 01:01:34,396
An atmosphere like this
might break anyone down.

866
01:01:34,471 --> 01:01:36,268
But I'm not breaking down.

867
01:01:36,606 --> 01:01:38,233
I did hear noises last night.

868
01:01:38,308 --> 01:01:40,776
Something was trying to get
into the room.

869
01:01:43,947 --> 01:01:48,816
You realize that if even one event
is proved to be a hallucination...

870
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:52,247
then this whole experiment
will be questioned.

871
01:01:53,156 --> 01:01:55,420
I'm not crazy, you know.

872
01:01:55,725 --> 01:01:59,855
After all, Theo was there, too.
Is it my fault it just didn't make sense?

873
01:02:05,435 --> 01:02:07,300
We'll let it go for now.

874
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:11,267
- Maybe I'm just being selfish.
- Selfish?

875
01:02:11,474 --> 01:02:14,204
Keeping you here
for the sake of the experiment.

876
01:02:14,878 --> 01:02:17,813
Of course, for the sake of the experiment.

877
01:02:17,881 --> 01:02:20,281
You do seem to be the main attraction...

878
01:02:21,318 --> 01:02:23,149
for whatever's in the house.

879
01:02:23,353 --> 01:02:27,449
- But I'll send you back the minute...
- No, please. I'm all right. Really I am.

880
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:33,055
Well, don't you two look cozy.

881
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:37,665
She was halfway off the verandah
when I caught her.

882
01:02:38,268 --> 01:02:41,362
I was leaning back
to see the top of the tower.

883
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:44,363
- I got dizzy.
- Dizzy like a fox?

884
01:02:46,576 --> 01:02:47,736
Poor Nell.

885
01:02:48,011 --> 01:02:51,105
You look like death. Let's go inside.

886
01:02:56,953 --> 01:02:59,421
I think you'd better move in with Eleanor.

887
01:02:59,489 --> 01:03:02,856
- You're the doctor.
- But that's my room, my very own room.

888
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:06,859
I wouldn't want to risk either of you
spending another night alone.

889
01:03:07,664 --> 01:03:09,495
Don't get all hung up, Nell.

890
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:13,160
We'll have fun. Like sisters.

891
01:03:21,845 --> 01:03:23,836
- It tickles.
- Of course.

892
01:03:24,614 --> 01:03:26,411
Your toes are tickled pink.

893
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:29,051
I knew my shade would suit you perfectly.

894
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,588
Have another drink.
It will keep the chill out.

895
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:35,089
Just a teensy one. To keep the chill out.

896
01:03:36,259 --> 01:03:38,921
- I don't really like whisky.
- This is brandy.

897
01:03:40,864 --> 01:03:44,630
By the time I'm through with you, Nell,
you'll be a different person.

898
01:03:46,736 --> 01:03:48,101
It's wicked.

899
01:03:49,005 --> 01:03:50,472
I mean, on my foot.

900
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:53,503
You've got foolishness
and wickedness mixed up.

901
01:03:54,411 --> 01:03:55,810
Maybe.

902
01:03:56,212 --> 01:03:58,942
Haven't had much chance
to learn the difference.

903
01:03:59,682 --> 01:04:02,742
Know something?
Even when I'd play solitaire in my room...

904
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:05,151
she'd bang on the wall
and make me feel guilty...

905
01:04:05,221 --> 01:04:07,621
for leaving her alone just that little bit.

906
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:09,817
- She'd always...
- Your mother?

907
01:04:11,594 --> 01:04:14,028
My mother...

908
01:04:17,033 --> 01:04:18,864
Story of my dull life.

909
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,601
What's your apartment like?

910
01:04:22,872 --> 01:04:27,036
It's an old place we furnished ourselves
from stuff we picked up in the junk shops.

911
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,305
We both love fixing over old things.

912
01:04:29,546 --> 01:04:30,706
Like me.

913
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,110
You married?

914
01:04:36,286 --> 01:04:37,275
No.

915
01:04:39,122 --> 01:04:40,384
I'm sorry.

916
01:04:42,258 --> 01:04:45,227
I'm stupid and wicked
and untrustworthy...

917
01:04:45,295 --> 01:04:48,162
- and not good for anything at all.
- I don't think so.

918
01:04:48,231 --> 01:04:50,722
Maybe just a little tight at the moment.

919
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:53,767
Tell me something about where you live.

920
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:01,039
I haven't had it long enough
to believe it's my own.

921
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:05,142
It's a little apartment.
Smaller than yours, I'm sure.

922
01:05:05,815 --> 01:05:08,477
I live alone. I'm still furnishing it.

923
01:05:09,385 --> 01:05:13,481
Buying one thing at a time
to make sure I get everything right.

924
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:19,759
Took me two weeks to find
the little stone lions I keep on the mantel.

925
01:05:21,131 --> 01:05:23,065
Brush their teeth every night.

926
01:05:23,933 --> 01:05:27,664
I've got a hunch I better get you back
to your apartment as fast as I can.

927
01:05:27,737 --> 01:05:29,398
- Don't say that.
- I only mean...

928
01:05:29,472 --> 01:05:31,064
Why do you all pick on me?

929
01:05:31,141 --> 01:05:34,269
Am I the public dump or something
for everybody's fear?

930
01:05:37,981 --> 01:05:40,745
I don't want to leave Hill House ever.

931
01:05:43,853 --> 01:05:47,380
I've been waiting all my life
for something like this to happen.

932
01:05:49,225 --> 01:05:51,591
Hey, everybody, come here.
I've found something.

933
01:05:58,301 --> 01:05:59,928
What's wrong with you, Doc?

934
01:06:00,003 --> 01:06:03,962
Stand there, go on.
You, too, girls. Stand there.

935
01:06:07,777 --> 01:06:10,268
A genuine cold spot.

936
01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:13,109
I guarantee it won't register
on any thermometer.

937
01:06:13,183 --> 01:06:15,845
Bunk. It's just a draft, that's all.

938
01:06:16,553 --> 01:06:19,420
- Coming from somewhere.
- A draft? In Hill House?

939
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:22,049
Not unless you can make
one of the doors stay open.

940
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:25,788
No, I found it. The heart of Hill House.

941
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:28,196
You mean where we're standing?

942
01:06:28,765 --> 01:06:30,232
Behind these doors.

943
01:06:31,067 --> 01:06:33,001
- What's in there?
- The nursery.

944
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:36,166
Abigail Crain grew up and died there.

945
01:06:37,774 --> 01:06:41,005
- Just the place to chill our beer.
- No, don't go in there.

946
01:06:41,344 --> 01:06:45,371
We'll keep the lid on the pressure cooker
a while longer, then.

947
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:47,446
Now don't give me that, Doc.

948
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:50,041
It's like the doorway to a tomb.

949
01:06:50,787 --> 01:06:52,118
Bless you.

950
01:06:53,389 --> 01:06:55,152
Now, that's enough, girls.

951
01:06:55,225 --> 01:06:57,625
You'd better run along to bed
before you catch cold.

952
01:06:57,694 --> 01:06:59,685
Yes, teacher. Bless you.

953
01:07:00,196 --> 01:07:01,185
Come on.

954
01:07:14,811 --> 01:07:16,836
No. There's got to be a draft.

955
01:07:19,182 --> 01:07:20,843
The floor's solid.

956
01:07:21,384 --> 01:07:24,251
Look, Doc, don't give me
any of that supernatural jazz.

957
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:28,484
This is something I can feel. And see.

958
01:07:28,992 --> 01:07:31,825
Maybe there's a pipeline to the North Pole.

959
01:07:32,161 --> 01:07:36,120
Why won't you accept it for what it is:
A supernatural phenomenon?

960
01:07:36,266 --> 01:07:38,461
You knock on wood, don't you?

961
01:07:38,868 --> 01:07:41,393
Yeah, what's that got to do with it?

962
01:07:41,704 --> 01:07:44,172
It shows that even you, despite yourself...

963
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,267
feel that there are forces
beyond nature able to help or hurt us.

964
01:07:49,312 --> 01:07:50,301
Wait a minute.

965
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,848
Are you telling me that belief
in a superstition...

966
01:07:52,915 --> 01:07:55,611
is the same thing
as believing in the supernatural?

967
01:07:55,685 --> 01:07:57,243
It's food for thought.

968
01:08:01,224 --> 01:08:02,919
Frozen food for thought.

969
01:08:09,932 --> 01:08:11,297
You know what I think?

970
01:08:11,367 --> 01:08:14,268
Markway has us all so edgy,
we're getting the cold sweats.

971
01:08:14,337 --> 01:08:16,965
The temperature needn't drop
to make you feel like that.

972
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,530
That's right.

973
01:08:18,608 --> 01:08:20,599
Music gives me goose bumps.

974
01:08:21,277 --> 01:08:23,609
Still, there was that awful smell
in the library.

975
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,580
Here we go again. You know very well...

976
01:08:25,648 --> 01:08:29,175
what you thought you smelled
in the library. The sickroom smell.

977
01:08:30,086 --> 01:08:32,520
Let's discuss me some other time.

978
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:34,520
I'm tired.

979
01:08:35,224 --> 01:08:37,988
- Turn out the light.
- I'd like it on. Have you seen this?

980
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:41,394
I told you. I just want to go to sleep.
Good night!

981
01:08:43,366 --> 01:08:46,824
Why be mad at me?
I don't think you killed your mother.

982
01:08:51,808 --> 01:08:53,105
Leave me alone.

983
01:08:54,644 --> 01:08:55,770
Go to sleep!

984
01:08:56,212 --> 01:08:57,941
Good night, Nellie my Nell.

985
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:00,434
Are you awake?
Don't say a word, Theo. Not a word.

986
01:10:00,977 --> 01:10:03,138
Don't let it know you're in my room.

987
01:10:25,768 --> 01:10:27,235
Hold my hand.

988
01:10:30,406 --> 01:10:32,306
And for God's sake, don't scream.

989
01:10:58,868 --> 01:11:01,769
Is it over? Do you think it's over?

990
01:11:03,639 --> 01:11:05,334
You're breaking my hand.

991
01:11:26,229 --> 01:11:28,322
<i>This is monstrous. This is cruel.</i>

992
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:32,058
<i>It is hurting a child</i>
<i>and I will not let anyone...</i>

993
01:11:32,134 --> 01:11:33,795
<i>anything hurt a child.</i>

994
01:11:34,437 --> 01:11:37,270
<i>I won't endure this. It thinks to scare me.</i>

995
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,274
<i>It has, and poor Theo, too.</i>

996
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:43,076
<i>Honestly, it feels like</i>
<i>she's breaking my hand.</i>

997
01:11:51,587 --> 01:11:54,317
<i>I will take a lot</i>
<i>from this filthy house for his sake...</i>

998
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:57,951
<i>but I will not go along</i>
<i>with hurting a child. No, I will not.</i>

999
01:11:58,327 --> 01:12:02,923
<i>I will get my mouth to open right now,</i>
<i>and I will yell.</i>

1000
01:12:05,234 --> 01:12:06,963
Stop it!

1001
01:12:14,043 --> 01:12:15,670
What, Nell?

1002
01:12:21,717 --> 01:12:22,706
Oh, God!

1003
01:12:28,357 --> 01:12:30,086
Whose hand was I holding?

1004
01:12:58,754 --> 01:13:01,917
- Eleanor, too bad. You just missed it.
- What?

1005
01:13:02,358 --> 01:13:04,690
The <i>Hill House Concerto for Harp.</i>

1006
01:13:06,128 --> 01:13:07,857
Were you playing the harp?

1007
01:13:08,064 --> 01:13:09,656
It was playing itself.

1008
01:13:10,833 --> 01:13:13,131
Naturally. How do you explain it?

1009
01:13:13,636 --> 01:13:15,797
Subterranean waters? Earth tremors?

1010
01:13:16,005 --> 01:13:19,805
As a matter of fact,
I don't think it is anything supernatural.

1011
01:13:20,009 --> 01:13:21,704
The self-starting music.

1012
01:13:21,877 --> 01:13:24,778
More likely it's in the realm
of the preternatural.

1013
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,940
Something we don't have
any natural explanation for right now...

1014
01:13:28,017 --> 01:13:30,212
but probably will have some day.

1015
01:13:30,286 --> 01:13:34,222
The preternatural of one generation
becomes the natural of the next.

1016
01:13:35,524 --> 01:13:39,392
Not so long ago, scientists laughed
at the idea of magnetic attraction.

1017
01:13:39,929 --> 01:13:43,592
They couldn't explain it,
so they refused to admit it existed.

1018
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,625
Life is still full of the preternatural.

1019
01:13:47,203 --> 01:13:48,431
My mother...

1020
01:13:48,938 --> 01:13:51,634
Go on. Say it.
You've been trying to since you got here.

1021
01:13:51,707 --> 01:13:55,370
I don't know what I was going to say.
I'm still so terrified from last night.

1022
01:13:55,444 --> 01:13:57,969
You shouldn't be.
It's silly to be frightened.

1023
01:13:58,047 --> 01:13:59,878
You haven't been through it.

1024
01:14:00,683 --> 01:14:02,708
This horrible unknown thing.

1025
01:14:02,885 --> 01:14:05,285
Unknown. That's the key word.

1026
01:14:05,955 --> 01:14:07,980
When we get involved
in a supernatural event...

1027
01:14:08,057 --> 01:14:11,083
we're scared out of our wits
just because it's unknown.

1028
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,991
The night cry of a child.

1029
01:14:13,229 --> 01:14:15,254
Face on the wall, knockings, bangings.

1030
01:14:15,331 --> 01:14:16,559
What's there to be afraid of?

1031
01:14:16,632 --> 01:14:20,068
You weren't threatened. It was harmless,
like a joke that didn't come off.

1032
01:14:20,136 --> 01:14:22,001
- But the child...
- There was no child.

1033
01:14:22,071 --> 01:14:23,698
- Just a voice.
- Worse.

1034
01:14:25,074 --> 01:14:26,974
Look, let me put it this way.

1035
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:30,244
When people believed the Earth was flat...

1036
01:14:30,312 --> 01:14:33,076
the idea of a round world
scared them silly.

1037
01:14:33,182 --> 01:14:35,810
Then they found out
how the round world works.

1038
01:14:35,885 --> 01:14:38,479
It's the same with the world
of the supernatural.

1039
01:14:38,554 --> 01:14:40,454
Until we know how it works...

1040
01:14:40,956 --> 01:14:44,722
we'll continue to carry around
this unnecessary burden of fear.

1041
01:14:48,364 --> 01:14:50,992
Supposing it is in my imagination...

1042
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:54,431
the knocking, the voices, everything.

1043
01:14:56,706 --> 01:14:58,799
Every cursed bit of the haunting.

1044
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:04,010
Suppose the haunting is all in my mind.

1045
01:15:04,113 --> 01:15:07,241
You can't say that
because there are three other people here.

1046
01:15:07,316 --> 01:15:09,648
We all resist the idea...

1047
01:15:09,852 --> 01:15:13,083
that what ran through the garden
the first night was a ghost...

1048
01:15:13,155 --> 01:15:16,921
what banged on the door was a ghost,
what held your hand was a ghost.

1049
01:15:17,026 --> 01:15:19,893
But there's certainly something
going on in Hill House.

1050
01:15:19,962 --> 01:15:23,625
We're getting close, Eleanor,
very close to finding out what it is.

1051
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:27,394
I could say all three of you
are in my imagination. None of this is real.

1052
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:30,200
Sure. That's the easiest way to dismiss
the supernatural...

1053
01:15:30,272 --> 01:15:33,105
by pleading insanity
or accusing others of it.

1054
01:15:33,275 --> 01:15:34,765
Maybe I am insane.

1055
01:15:40,282 --> 01:15:42,079
The night my mother died...

1056
01:15:43,085 --> 01:15:44,780
she knocked on the wall.

1057
01:15:45,721 --> 01:15:47,120
And I didn't come.

1058
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:52,656
Eleven years of looking in on her
after every small noise.

1059
01:15:53,462 --> 01:15:54,690
That night...

1060
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,760
my back hurt and my hands.

1061
01:15:58,334 --> 01:16:01,235
It wasn't fair.
We could've afforded a laundress.

1062
01:16:01,537 --> 01:16:04,938
I ought to have brought her the medicine.
I always did before.

1063
01:16:05,074 --> 01:16:06,302
This time...

1064
01:16:08,277 --> 01:16:09,642
she called me...

1065
01:16:10,546 --> 01:16:12,138
and I never answered.

1066
01:16:15,017 --> 01:16:17,417
- Is that how a normal person acts?
- Yes.

1067
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:22,347
You were tired and disgusted. 11 years!

1068
01:16:23,526 --> 01:16:24,857
You're human.

1069
01:16:25,427 --> 01:16:27,987
Stop trying to be either a saint
or a martyr.

1070
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:30,890
You probably like thinking
it was your fault.

1071
01:16:31,867 --> 01:16:34,392
My sister says I wanted Mother to die.

1072
01:16:36,038 --> 01:16:39,064
I've wondered ever since
if I didn't wake up in the night...

1073
01:16:39,141 --> 01:16:42,542
and hear her just go back to sleep.

1074
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:45,674
It would have been easy.

1075
01:16:45,948 --> 01:16:49,440
- I've wondered about it.
- No, you're not capable of that.

1076
01:16:50,586 --> 01:16:52,520
You're a fine person, Eleanor.

1077
01:16:53,088 --> 01:16:55,579
Sensitive and honest and thoroughly good.

1078
01:16:57,827 --> 01:17:00,990
- Do you really think so, John?
- I do indeed.

1079
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:06,532
Goose bumps.

1080
01:17:08,404 --> 01:17:11,999
There isn't by any chance
a cold spot in this room, too, is there?

1081
01:17:12,374 --> 01:17:14,069
No, there isn't.

1082
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,253
<i>"Journeys end in lovers meeting."</i>

1083
01:17:34,964 --> 01:17:37,091
<i>All I want is to be cherished.</i>

1084
01:17:38,467 --> 01:17:41,300
<i>And here we are listening</i>
<i>to that ridiculous harp.</i>

1085
01:17:43,873 --> 01:17:46,774
"Lust. Daughter, preserve thyself.

1086
01:17:49,011 --> 01:17:53,004
"Hold apart from this world,

1087
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:56,283
"Could you but hear for a moment

1088
01:17:57,152 --> 01:17:58,619
"the screaming... "

1089
01:17:59,655 --> 01:18:01,646
Oh, now, get this, congregation.

1090
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:04,548
''...the dreadful crying out of the lustful...

1091
01:18:04,793 --> 01:18:07,853
"damned for eternity
in everlasting flame! "

1092
01:18:08,764 --> 01:18:11,232
- What have you got there?
- I found it in the library.

1093
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:12,767
He made it himself.

1094
01:18:13,002 --> 01:18:13,991
Look.

1095
01:18:14,203 --> 01:18:16,068
"Memories for Abigail Lester Crain:

1096
01:18:16,138 --> 01:18:18,436
"A legacy for her education
and enlightenment.

1097
01:18:18,507 --> 01:18:20,975
"From her devoted father,
Hugh Desmond Lester Crain...

1098
01:18:21,043 --> 01:18:23,671
"Hill House, October 21, 1873."

1099
01:18:24,446 --> 01:18:27,973
- But that's today.
- Tomorrow and 90 years later.

1100
01:18:28,684 --> 01:18:30,311
Some nursery book, huh?

1101
01:18:31,186 --> 01:18:34,747
"Honor the authors of thy being, daughter.

1102
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:37,356
"Thy father and thy mother."

1103
01:18:38,694 --> 01:18:42,255
Just the thing to give a child at bedtime.
No family should be without one.

1104
01:18:42,331 --> 01:18:46,563
I can see him now spitting out the words
so they take root in her little mind.

1105
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:51,869
Hugh Crain, you were a dirty man
and you made a dirty house.

1106
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:54,601
If you can hear me,
I'm telling you to your face...

1107
01:18:54,677 --> 01:18:58,010
I hope you spend eternity
in that foul, rotten book...

1108
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,275
and never stop burning for a minute.

1109
01:19:04,653 --> 01:19:08,020
- Don't be a bore, Nell. Sit down and we'll...
- Leave me alone.

1110
01:19:08,824 --> 01:19:10,416
You are a bore.

1111
01:19:11,093 --> 01:19:12,924
I've got it. I'll tear out the pictures...

1112
01:19:12,995 --> 01:19:16,362
and send them as Christmas cards
to my New England relatives.

1113
01:19:16,532 --> 01:19:19,592
I think it's funny. "Dear Uncle Ned:
Merry Christmas, may your soul... "

1114
01:19:19,668 --> 01:19:21,101
Close that book.

1115
01:19:21,804 --> 01:19:23,635
It's enough to set
anyone's nerves on edge.

1116
01:19:23,706 --> 01:19:26,504
It's not the book
that's making our Nell nervous.

1117
01:19:26,608 --> 01:19:28,735
She's worried about her apartment.

1118
01:19:29,878 --> 01:19:32,278
I didn't know.
Is there anything I can do to help?

1119
01:19:32,348 --> 01:19:34,111
She thinks she's being funny.

1120
01:19:34,183 --> 01:19:36,651
Tell me, Dr. Markway,
are you fond of stone lions...

1121
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:39,745
- the kind you keep on the mantel?
- Shut up, Theo.

1122
01:19:39,855 --> 01:19:42,847
Do you long for a tiny home,
something smaller than Hill House?

1123
01:19:42,925 --> 01:19:44,722
There's room for two, isn't there, Nell?

1124
01:19:44,793 --> 01:19:49,059
You're a monster, Theo.
You're the monster of Hill House.

1125
01:19:53,769 --> 01:19:56,101
- You'd better go with her.
- Wouldn't you rather?

1126
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:59,538
I said go with her.
She shouldn't be left in that room alone.

1127
01:20:06,915 --> 01:20:08,883
Here you are. Okay, Isolde.

1128
01:20:08,951 --> 01:20:11,112
- Tristan wants you inside.
- Leave me alone.

1129
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:12,983
Stop trying to be the center of attention.

1130
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:15,182
- Come inside.
- You revolt me.

1131
01:20:16,425 --> 01:20:18,290
Can't you take a joke?

1132
01:20:18,727 --> 01:20:20,661
I didn't know you
were serious about Markway.

1133
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:22,390
Of course you did.

1134
01:20:23,032 --> 01:20:25,193
But he shouldn't be allowed
to get away with it.

1135
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:26,962
Get away with what?

1136
01:20:27,102 --> 01:20:30,868
- You're making a fool of yourself over him.
- Suppose I'm not, though.

1137
01:20:30,939 --> 01:20:34,067
You'd mind terribly if you turned out
to be wrong for once.

1138
01:20:34,143 --> 01:20:38,273
- You poor stupid innocent.
- I'd rather be innocent than like you.

1139
01:20:39,348 --> 01:20:40,815
Meaning what?

1140
01:20:40,983 --> 01:20:43,281
Now who's being stupid and innocent?

1141
01:20:43,752 --> 01:20:47,654
- You know perfectly well what I mean.
- Is this one of your crazy hallucinations?

1142
01:20:47,723 --> 01:20:49,884
- I'm not crazy.
- Crazy as a loon.

1143
01:20:49,958 --> 01:20:53,223
You expect me to believe you're sane
and the rest of the world is mad?

1144
01:20:53,295 --> 01:20:54,762
Why not?

1145
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:57,094
The world is full of inconsistencies.

1146
01:20:57,399 --> 01:21:01,733
Unnatural things. "Nature's mistakes,"
they're called. You, for instance.

1147
01:21:18,887 --> 01:21:21,913
A reporter's been telephoning all day.
He's on your track.

1148
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:24,288
- He's heard about you renting this place.
- How?

1149
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:26,793
The Dudleys, I bet.
They must've blabbed in town.

1150
01:21:26,862 --> 01:21:28,625
Come back with me now, please.

1151
01:21:28,697 --> 01:21:31,894
If they find out why you're here,
the papers'll have a field day.

1152
01:21:31,967 --> 01:21:33,366
Who are you?

1153
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:34,929
Grace Markway.

1154
01:21:36,371 --> 01:21:38,498
Didn't John tell you he's married?

1155
01:21:39,007 --> 01:21:41,532
- I tried to warn you.
- Welcome to our party.

1156
01:21:42,177 --> 01:21:43,838
Who are you?

1157
01:21:44,046 --> 01:21:46,947
We're researchers in the field
of psychic phenomena.

1158
01:21:47,015 --> 01:21:49,449
Please go.
You couldn't have arrived at a worse time.

1159
01:21:49,518 --> 01:21:51,952
Stop this insanity, John,
and come back with me.

1160
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:53,180
I can't. Not now.

1161
01:21:53,255 --> 01:21:56,122
I'm convinced
we're on the verge of a breakthrough.

1162
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:58,889
Here you are, driver, that'll be all.

1163
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:01,994
<i>But I had to come. I had to.</i>

1164
01:22:02,998 --> 01:22:04,966
<i>I've waited such a long time.</i>

1165
01:22:05,534 --> 01:22:07,468
<i>I've earned my happiness.</i>

1166
01:22:09,972 --> 01:22:12,440
I was afraid this would be your attitude.

1167
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:16,402
I'm not leaving here until you've got
sense enough to leave with me.

1168
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:19,038
I hope no one minds
if I join the ghost hunt.

1169
01:22:20,082 --> 01:22:22,607
All right, I'll put your things in my room.

1170
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:25,946
I'll be very disappointed
if I don't see a ghost.

1171
01:22:26,021 --> 01:22:28,319
Hadn't you better put me
in the ghastly dungeon...

1172
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:30,585
or the mysterious secret chamber?

1173
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:33,389
There are no dungeons,
no secret chambers in Hill House.

1174
01:22:33,462 --> 01:22:35,555
In fact, nothing romantic at all.

1175
01:22:36,064 --> 01:22:38,225
It's a deadly serious place.

1176
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,327
- Not even a treasure buried in the cellar?
- There's the nursery.

1177
01:22:43,305 --> 01:22:45,603
Thank you, my dear. The nursery it is.

1178
01:22:55,918 --> 01:22:59,183
You must listen to me.
Certain things have happened here.

1179
01:22:59,488 --> 01:23:02,787
You may not believe in the supernatural,
but these are physical facts.

1180
01:23:02,858 --> 01:23:06,021
Mrs. Markway, please...

1181
01:23:06,728 --> 01:23:08,525
Don't sleep in the nursery.

1182
01:23:08,864 --> 01:23:11,025
I didn't realize what I was saying.

1183
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,500
You insult my intelligence.

1184
01:23:13,635 --> 01:23:17,901
You don't think I'd believe anything
you ghost hunters might tell me.

1185
01:23:17,973 --> 01:23:20,464
Even so, you shouldn't sleep in that room.

1186
01:23:21,009 --> 01:23:23,341
It hasn't been opened
since we've been here.

1187
01:23:23,412 --> 01:23:27,781
I agree with you about the spook bit,
Mrs. M, but it's true, the air might be bad.

1188
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:29,349
Oh, poisonous.

1189
01:23:29,551 --> 01:23:32,418
I've just remembered. No problem.

1190
01:23:32,487 --> 01:23:36,583
I don't have the key to the nursery,
and the Dudleys have gone for the night.

1191
01:23:36,792 --> 01:23:39,192
Incidentally,
how'd you get through the gate?

1192
01:23:39,261 --> 01:23:41,855
Very supernatural. With a key.

1193
01:23:42,331 --> 01:23:44,856
Your Mrs. Dudley is quite human,
I assure you...

1194
01:23:44,933 --> 01:23:47,128
and not at all averse to a $5 bill.

1195
01:23:48,971 --> 01:23:50,302
Hey, look.

1196
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:05,547
From your expressions,
I gather that is the dreaded nursery.

1197
01:24:06,888 --> 01:24:09,550
And as for the bad air,
it's quite the opposite.

1198
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:11,650
There seems to be a draft.

1199
01:24:12,661 --> 01:24:14,128
Wait a minute, Doc.

1200
01:24:15,831 --> 01:24:18,425
This is ridiculous.
Nobody opened these doors.

1201
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,967
That's right, Luke.
You're beginning to see the light.

1202
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:23,935
I haven't seen a damn thing.

1203
01:24:26,074 --> 01:24:28,235
I just don't like the way it looks.

1204
01:24:30,345 --> 01:24:33,542
Now I know who your fiend
of Hill House is.

1205
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:35,242
The interior decorator.

1206
01:24:35,384 --> 01:24:38,353
Evidently Mrs. Dudley
doesn't get in here very often.

1207
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:40,888
Looks the same
as the rest of the house to me.

1208
01:24:40,956 --> 01:24:44,084
It's no use, Grace. The air in here is stale.

1209
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:46,293
I can take care of that.

1210
01:24:46,662 --> 01:24:49,756
Only one way
to argue with a woman, Doc. Don't.

1211
01:24:50,565 --> 01:24:52,226
Good night.

1212
01:24:53,335 --> 01:24:54,563
My mother...

1213
01:25:00,175 --> 01:25:03,338
This room is the cold,
rotten heart of the house.

1214
01:25:03,512 --> 01:25:05,480
Since you're so foolish, I'll stay with you.

1215
01:25:05,547 --> 01:25:07,708
But you're not to be
in this room alone tonight.

1216
01:25:07,783 --> 01:25:11,480
I can't go on watching you waste your life
on all this nonsense.

1217
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:15,781
If there is such a thing as a haunted house,
this is my chance to find out.

1218
01:25:15,924 --> 01:25:17,016
All right.

1219
01:25:18,627 --> 01:25:21,221
John, my bag.

1220
01:25:22,197 --> 01:25:24,062
At least leave the door open.

1221
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:27,559
Don't worry.
I've brought a special ghost trap with me.

1222
01:25:34,676 --> 01:25:38,203
<i>What if he does have a wife?</i>
<i>I still have a place in this house.</i>

1223
01:25:38,413 --> 01:25:41,507
<i>I belong. I want to stay here.</i>

1224
01:25:42,284 --> 01:25:45,117
<i>It's the only time</i>
<i>anything's ever happened to me.</i>

1225
01:25:45,654 --> 01:25:49,556
<i>He can't make me leave,</i>
<i>not if Hill House means me to stay.</i>

1226
01:25:50,392 --> 01:25:55,022
<i>Go away, Eleanor, we don't want you</i>
<i>anymore, you can't stay.</i>

1227
01:25:56,631 --> 01:25:58,599
<i>But I can.</i>

1228
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:01,499
<i>He doesn't make the rules around here.</i>

1229
01:26:03,805 --> 01:26:05,272
Nell, I'm talking to you.

1230
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:07,641
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter?

1231
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:09,404
Didn't you hear Markway?

1232
01:26:10,212 --> 01:26:11,702
He doesn't want us to stay here.

1233
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:14,340
He wants us to spend the night
downstairs in the parlor.

1234
01:26:14,416 --> 01:26:17,408
Luke and he will take turns
watching on this floor.

1235
01:26:18,453 --> 01:26:20,887
For Pete's sake, snap out of it.

1236
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1237
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:02,680
- Why aren't you upstairs?
- I needed a drink.

1238
01:28:28,316 --> 01:28:29,578
- Grace.
- Wait a minute.

1239
01:28:36,558 --> 01:28:39,186
It's nowhere near the nursery,
it's down here.

1240
01:28:50,305 --> 01:28:52,933
It seems to me
we've been on this kick before.

1241
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:55,870
Next vacation
I must really go somewhere else.

1242
01:29:11,927 --> 01:29:15,328
<i>It knows my name.</i>
<i>This time it knows my name.</i>

1243
01:29:16,531 --> 01:29:18,522
- I'll have to go out there.
- No!

1244
01:29:20,035 --> 01:29:24,529
- It hasn't hurt me. Why should it hurt her?
- She might try to do something about it.

1245
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:30,673
Is it over, Theo? Is it?

1246
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,841
No, I'm so cold.

1247
01:29:34,583 --> 01:29:37,211
It's going to start everything
all over again.

1248
01:29:44,826 --> 01:29:47,522
It can't get in. Don't let it get in.

1249
01:30:11,553 --> 01:30:13,350
Oh, God, it knows I'm here.

1250
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:44,449
Doc, I'll let you have the house cheap.

1251
01:31:22,157 --> 01:31:25,854
<i>It will go on and on</i>
<i>and come back again until it finds me.</i>

1252
01:31:26,928 --> 01:31:30,420
<i>On and on until it finds me.</i>

1253
01:31:41,843 --> 01:31:43,333
It's at the nursery.

1254
01:31:43,945 --> 01:31:45,708
- You must be crazy!
- I'm going out there!

1255
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:47,372
Not with that thing out there.

1256
01:31:47,449 --> 01:31:50,384
- We have to, Luke. She's there!
- Don't be crazy.

1257
01:31:50,452 --> 01:31:52,579
I've got to find out if Grace is all right.

1258
01:31:52,654 --> 01:31:55,122
I don't know what it is,
but I don't want to find out...

1259
01:31:55,190 --> 01:31:58,591
I've got to get out of here.
I've got to find out if Grace is all right.

1260
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:00,184
- No, don't.
- Cut it out!

1261
01:32:00,261 --> 01:32:02,593
<i>I'll come.</i>

1262
01:32:03,998 --> 01:32:06,296
<i>Whatever it wants of me it can have.</i>

1263
01:33:14,169 --> 01:33:16,433
<i>The house is coming down around me.</i>

1264
01:33:16,938 --> 01:33:19,532
<i>The house is destroying itself.</i>

1265
01:33:37,992 --> 01:33:39,459
It's in the nursery.

1266
01:34:04,752 --> 01:34:06,049
Mrs. Markway?

1267
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:09,779
Please.

1268
01:34:15,263 --> 01:34:17,288
Grace, are you...

1269
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:19,798
Where is she?

1270
01:34:21,169 --> 01:34:23,967
- Where is she? What did you see?
- Nothing.

1271
01:34:25,673 --> 01:34:27,004
She wasn't here.

1272
01:34:28,243 --> 01:34:29,608
- What happened?
- She's gone.

1273
01:34:29,677 --> 01:34:31,167
Where? How?

1274
01:34:31,346 --> 01:34:32,438
Good God!

1275
01:34:32,513 --> 01:34:34,606
Markway, if this is your idea of a joke...

1276
01:34:34,682 --> 01:34:37,310
if living in a haunted house
has done this to you...

1277
01:34:37,385 --> 01:34:38,977
We'll start here, then the whole house.

1278
01:34:39,053 --> 01:34:42,147
- Even if we have to tear the place apart.
- You can't do that.

1279
01:34:42,223 --> 01:34:45,124
If we don't find her,
the police will be around.

1280
01:34:45,193 --> 01:34:47,991
<i>I'm coming apart, a little at a time.</i>

1281
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:54,427
<i>Now I know where I'm going.</i>

1282
01:34:54,969 --> 01:34:58,905
<i>I'm disappearing inch by inch</i>
<i>into this house.</i>

1283
01:35:06,114 --> 01:35:09,606
We killed her. You and I, Hugh Crain.

1284
01:35:44,686 --> 01:35:47,052
She must be around this house
somewhere.

1285
01:35:48,089 --> 01:35:49,954
Maybe this whole thing is a bad joke.

1286
01:35:50,024 --> 01:35:53,460
- She isn't the kind who makes jokes.
- You find her, she's your wife.

1287
01:35:53,528 --> 01:35:56,088
I'm taking Nell
and I'm clearing out of here.

1288
01:35:56,364 --> 01:35:57,991
Where is Eleanor?

1289
01:36:11,512 --> 01:36:13,036
<i>I want to stay here.</i>

1290
01:36:14,449 --> 01:36:16,508
<i>I want to stay here always.</i>

1291
01:36:20,221 --> 01:36:22,746
<i>I will not be frightened or alone anymore.</i>

1292
01:36:31,132 --> 01:36:33,032
Has anyone checked outside?

1293
01:36:35,036 --> 01:36:37,231
Please, Nell, where are you?

1294
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,878
<i>Here I am, inside.</i>

1295
01:36:49,617 --> 01:36:53,348
<i>It's not cold at all and the smell is gone.</i>

1296
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:24,848
<i>I've broken the spell of Hill House.</i>

1297
01:37:25,753 --> 01:37:26,947
<i>I'm home.</i>

1298
01:37:33,561 --> 01:37:37,759
<i>No stone lions for me. I am home.</i>

1299
01:39:15,129 --> 01:39:16,289
<i>I will not look back...</i>

1300
01:39:16,364 --> 01:39:19,060
<i>because then they will know</i>
<i>what I am thinking.</i>

1301
01:39:19,367 --> 01:39:21,631
Eleanor, turn around and come down.

1302
01:39:29,677 --> 01:39:31,201
Now, be very, very careful.

1303
01:39:33,614 --> 01:39:35,104
Come down.

1304
01:39:40,855 --> 01:39:43,255
<i>All that is gone and left behind.</i>

1305
01:39:44,525 --> 01:39:46,220
Eleanor, for God's sake!

1306
01:39:55,736 --> 01:40:00,196
- Wait a minute. This thing will collapse...
- It can't possibly hold the both of you.

1307
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:14,349
Just turn around, Eleanor.

1308
01:40:14,989 --> 01:40:17,583
Keep hold of the rail
and start down slowly.

1309
01:40:49,924 --> 01:40:51,619
Stand still! Don't move!

1310
01:40:53,995 --> 01:40:55,587
Stand perfectly still!

1311
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:58,055
Nell, do what they say, please!

1312
01:41:36,137 --> 01:41:38,037
I'm coming on the platform.

1313
01:42:24,952 --> 01:42:26,476
Now come along.

1314
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

1315
01:42:50,177 --> 01:42:52,042
Are you sure, Eleanor?

1316
01:42:52,713 --> 01:42:54,305
It was Mrs. Markway.

1317
01:42:55,015 --> 01:42:58,678
Just before I fainted, I looked up,
and there she was above the trap door.

1318
01:42:58,753 --> 01:43:01,051
What's more, she's still around.

1319
01:43:01,589 --> 01:43:04,251
I don't know
who or what you really saw, Eleanor.

1320
01:43:04,325 --> 01:43:07,055
But whatever it was,
we can't risk letting it happen again.

1321
01:43:07,128 --> 01:43:09,790
- That's why you're leaving now.
- But I can't leave now.

1322
01:43:09,864 --> 01:43:13,823
- I brought the car round front. She ready?
- She's all packed. Take her suitcase.

1323
01:43:13,901 --> 01:43:16,369
No, please, Luke, let me stay.

1324
01:43:16,437 --> 01:43:18,200
I'll help Mrs. Dudley.

1325
01:43:18,472 --> 01:43:20,736
All it will cost you is just my keep.

1326
01:43:20,941 --> 01:43:23,432
Sorry, honey,
but you're not the type I keep.

1327
01:43:23,511 --> 01:43:27,072
- I can't leave, I tell you.
- I can't take any more chances.

1328
01:43:27,548 --> 01:43:30,517
I realize now what a terrible thing
I was asking of you all.

1329
01:43:30,584 --> 01:43:34,543
You're leaving as quickly as you can.
Then we'll find Grace or go to the police.

1330
01:43:34,622 --> 01:43:35,884
It isn't fair.

1331
01:43:35,956 --> 01:43:38,948
I'm the one who's supposed to stay here.
She's taken my place.

1332
01:43:39,026 --> 01:43:41,119
Don't worry.
Luke will see you get there safely.

1333
01:43:41,195 --> 01:43:43,925
- Get where?
- Why, home, of course.

1334
01:43:43,998 --> 01:43:47,263
Go back to your own little apartment
where all your things are.

1335
01:43:47,334 --> 01:43:48,892
I haven't any home.

1336
01:43:49,303 --> 01:43:50,531
I made it up.

1337
01:43:51,338 --> 01:43:53,169
No apartment, no things...

1338
01:43:54,208 --> 01:43:56,335
Everything in all the world
that belongs to me...

1339
01:43:56,410 --> 01:43:59,106
is in that suitcase and a carton in my car.

1340
01:44:00,247 --> 01:44:03,182
So you see,
there's no place you can send me.

1341
01:44:03,751 --> 01:44:05,241
I have to stay here.

1342
01:44:05,419 --> 01:44:07,512
You must have lived somewhere before.

1343
01:44:07,588 --> 01:44:10,489
- You had an address where I wrote you.
- My sister's.

1344
01:44:11,225 --> 01:44:13,591
I sleep on a couch in the living room.

1345
01:44:13,828 --> 01:44:16,797
I'd be much happier here.
I can't go back to my sister's.

1346
01:44:16,864 --> 01:44:19,059
Yes, you can, and immediately.

1347
01:44:20,401 --> 01:44:24,030
This is a mistake. Don't you understand?
The house wants me.

1348
01:44:24,438 --> 01:44:26,906
Mrs. Markway can't satisfy it.
No one else can.

1349
01:44:26,974 --> 01:44:28,771
Forget about this house
as soon as you can.

1350
01:44:28,843 --> 01:44:32,609
No, please. I'm fine now. I'm not afraid.

1351
01:44:34,381 --> 01:44:35,746
I was happy here.

1352
01:44:36,817 --> 01:44:40,116
- I don't think Mrs. Markway will be.
- Put the bag in the car, Luke.

1353
01:44:40,187 --> 01:44:42,314
Nell is right. Grace is around somewhere.

1354
01:44:42,389 --> 01:44:44,914
- You see?
- Please, there's no time to waste.

1355
01:44:45,059 --> 01:44:48,551
Please, let me stay. I'm the only one
who can call Mrs. Markway back.

1356
01:44:48,629 --> 01:44:51,792
I was wrong. I should have sent
you home the first night.

1357
01:44:54,969 --> 01:44:57,938
This is the only time
anything's ever happened to me.

1358
01:45:03,444 --> 01:45:05,469
I'm the one it really wants.

1359
01:45:07,281 --> 01:45:10,739
Can't you feel it? It's alive.

1360
01:45:11,986 --> 01:45:13,385
Watching...

1361
01:45:14,255 --> 01:45:15,620
waiting...

1362
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:21,252
Waiting for me.

1363
01:45:26,767 --> 01:45:28,359
I won't go away.

1364
01:45:28,702 --> 01:45:30,795
You will go away. Right now.

1365
01:45:34,174 --> 01:45:36,665
- No, come on.
- I'll drive. It's my car.

1366
01:45:37,745 --> 01:45:39,474
At least, half mine.

1367
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:42,576
All right, let her.
I can't stand here arguing.

1368
01:45:43,017 --> 01:45:45,485
Thank you for rescuing me in the library.

1369
01:45:47,087 --> 01:45:50,454
That was wrong of me, I know,
but I'm all right now, honestly.

1370
01:45:50,524 --> 01:45:53,721
I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry, really.

1371
01:45:57,831 --> 01:45:58,855
Goodbye.

1372
01:45:59,233 --> 01:46:00,860
Let's get moving.

1373
01:46:08,742 --> 01:46:11,040
I thought you weren't going
to say goodbye.

1374
01:46:11,111 --> 01:46:13,909
Nellie my Nell, be happy, please be happy.

1375
01:46:14,515 --> 01:46:16,380
Everything's going to be all right.

1376
01:46:16,450 --> 01:46:19,351
I'm sure Grace is here and we'll find her.
So don't worry.

1377
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:21,752
She has my place. It isn't fair.

1378
01:46:22,189 --> 01:46:23,918
Goodbye, Eleanor.

1379
01:46:27,728 --> 01:46:30,720
I'll write you. Drive carefully.

1380
01:46:34,335 --> 01:46:35,962
Goodbye.

1381
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,899
Who do I thank for a lovely time?

1382
01:46:46,447 --> 01:46:48,176
Oh, hold it. Markway!

1383
01:46:51,952 --> 01:46:52,941
The key.

1384
01:46:53,954 --> 01:46:56,582
- To the gate.
- Yes, of course.

1385
01:46:57,758 --> 01:47:01,285
<i>What fools they are.</i>
<i>The house tricks them so easily.</i>

1386
01:47:01,929 --> 01:47:05,194
<i>Just by telling me to go away,</i>
<i>they can't make me leave.</i>

1387
01:47:06,066 --> 01:47:07,863
<i>They can't shut me out.</i>

1388
01:47:08,202 --> 01:47:10,534
<i>Not if Hill House means me to stay.</i>

1389
01:47:11,805 --> 01:47:13,466
- Eleanor.
- Wait.

1390
01:47:24,685 --> 01:47:26,414
<i>So now I'm going.</i>

1391
01:47:27,087 --> 01:47:30,614
<i>But I won't go. Hill House belongs to me.</i>

1392
01:47:33,794 --> 01:47:35,955
<i>I knew it.</i>

1393
01:47:36,430 --> 01:47:38,523
<i>Hill House doesn't want me to go.</i>

1394
01:47:45,606 --> 01:47:47,904
Stop it. Please. What are you doing?

1395
01:47:48,442 --> 01:47:49,841
Let go.

1396
01:47:51,712 --> 01:47:53,179
What are you doing?

1397
01:47:55,282 --> 01:47:58,445
<i>Why don't they stop me?</i>
<i>Can't they see what is happening?</i>

1398
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:02,220
<i>But it's happening to you, Eleanor.</i>

1399
01:48:02,856 --> 01:48:06,451
<i>Yes. Something at last is really...</i>

1400
01:48:09,029 --> 01:48:11,224
<i>really happening to me.</i>

1401
01:48:44,932 --> 01:48:46,297
She's dead.

1402
01:49:00,114 --> 01:49:03,572
I didn't want any of this to happen.
You must believe me, John.

1403
01:49:04,051 --> 01:49:06,212
What were you doing? What happened?

1404
01:49:06,687 --> 01:49:08,177
That terrible house.

1405
01:49:08,822 --> 01:49:12,952
I woke up and I was frightened.
So I tried to find your room, but I got lost.

1406
01:49:13,026 --> 01:49:15,893
Almost as though
the house were doing it on purpose.

1407
01:49:15,963 --> 01:49:17,726
And I ended up in the attic.

1408
01:49:17,798 --> 01:49:20,892
I was only trying to find a way out
when I opened the trap door.

1409
01:49:20,968 --> 01:49:23,061
I wasn't trying to frighten her.

1410
01:49:23,137 --> 01:49:26,595
- Didn't you see me?
- No, but Eleanor did.

1411
01:49:27,174 --> 01:49:29,301
The shock of seeing you almost killed her.

1412
01:49:29,376 --> 01:49:30,502
She did kill her.

1413
01:49:31,678 --> 01:49:34,408
Seeing her is what made Eleanor
lose control of the car.

1414
01:49:34,481 --> 01:49:38,110
No. She only saw me the very last instant.

1415
01:49:38,185 --> 01:49:40,380
The same time I saw her.

1416
01:49:41,054 --> 01:49:43,318
I don't even know how I got out here.

1417
01:49:43,824 --> 01:49:45,348
It wasn't your fault.

1418
01:49:46,493 --> 01:49:48,222
Eleanor did it to herself.

1419
01:49:48,996 --> 01:49:51,021
It looked to me, anyway, like she...

1420
01:49:51,098 --> 01:49:53,589
deliberately aimed the car at this tree.

1421
01:49:54,768 --> 01:49:58,534
Where the first Mrs. Crain
was also killed in an "accident."

1422
01:50:00,407 --> 01:50:01,772
Here's the mark.

1423
01:50:04,578 --> 01:50:07,445
There was something in the car with her,
I'm sure of it.

1424
01:50:07,514 --> 01:50:10,415
Call it what you like,
but Hill House is haunted.

1425
01:50:11,485 --> 01:50:14,454
It didn't want her to leave,
and her poor bedeviled mind...

1426
01:50:14,521 --> 01:50:16,614
wasn't strong enough to fight it.

1427
01:50:18,192 --> 01:50:20,854
- Poor Eleanor.
- Maybe not "poor" Eleanor.

1428
01:50:22,496 --> 01:50:25,158
It was what she wanted, to stay here.

1429
01:50:26,567 --> 01:50:28,432
She had no place else to go.

1430
01:50:30,204 --> 01:50:32,729
The house belongs to her now, too.

1431
01:50:33,307 --> 01:50:34,797
Maybe she's happier.

1432
01:50:35,509 --> 01:50:37,136
You wait here, Grace.

1433
01:50:37,211 --> 01:50:39,771
I'll go and get your things
and call the police.

1434
01:50:39,847 --> 01:50:42,816
No one must go in that house again.
Whatever is there might...

1435
01:50:42,883 --> 01:50:44,316
I'll be all right.

1436
01:50:45,085 --> 01:50:49,044
The house has what it wants... for a while.

1437
01:50:57,231 --> 01:51:01,224
It ought to be burned down
and the ground sowed with salt.

1438
01:51:06,974 --> 01:51:11,502
<i>Hill House has stood for 90 years</i>
<i>and might stand for 90 more.</i>

1439
01:51:12,446 --> 01:51:16,712
<i>Within, walls continue upright,</i>
<i>bricks meet...</i>

1440
01:51:17,317 --> 01:51:21,310
<i>floors are firm,</i>
<i>and doors are sensibly shut.</i>

1441
01:51:22,322 --> 01:51:26,156
<i>Silence lies steadily against the wood</i>
<i>and stone of Hill House.</i>

1442
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,496
<i>And we who walk here walk alone.</i>
