1
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:18,953
West!

2
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:23,590
You bastard.

3
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,295
You did this to me.

4
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,847
But you'll not escape me.

5
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,350
Not this time!

6
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:18,683
- Take this.
- It'll burst an artery.

7
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,063
If we don't remove this now, he's
going to go into cardiac arrest.

8
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,561
I assure you.
Be ready to clamp.

9
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:25,770
- If it doesn't hold...
- We have no choice, Dan.

10
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:28,692
Now!

11
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,360
Jesus Christ!

12
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:35,737
It didn't hold!

13
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:44,626
But his central nervous system
is still intact.

14
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:48,751
He might still prove to be useful.

15
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,295
More useful than he'd be otherwise.

16
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:18,576
We have to retreat!

17
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,907
The frontlines have weakened.

18
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:39,600
- God damnit, Herbert! What are you doing?
- You know very well what I'm doing, Dan.

19
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:42,895
- Don't you ever stop?
- We may never again have access

20
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:46,942
- to this volume of fresh subjects.
- Fascinating, there's somebody here.

21
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:54,115
- What do you want? Get away from those!
- What are you doing back here?

22
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,318
- Leave.
- Put that thing away!

23
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:58,403
This is too dangerous
for all of us.

24
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:00,760
Where are you going?
We've got lots of work to do here.

25
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:03,749
Come on!
Jesus Christ!

26
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,959
- She's right!
- She's wrong.

27
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,128
- No!
- Listen, we are close, Dan.

28
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:09,672
Reticular consciousness
is not just in the brain.

29
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:12,752
We know that, yes?
We've gone beyond that.

30
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:14,085
Look at this.

31
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,472
These reptiles are the key, Dan.

32
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:20,016
Yes.

33
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:22,518
You just still don't
understand, do you?

34
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,349
This is no longer about
just reanimating the dead.

35
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:30,148
We will create new life.

36
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:32,854
Hang on!

37
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:39,239
Francesca?

38
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:41,868
Get out of here!

39
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,497
Come on! Let's go!

40
00:03:48,712 --> 00:03:50,334
- Let's go.
- My notes.

41
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,089
- Leave them!
- Wait!

42
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,793
- Forget it!
- We'll need this back home.

43
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:56,298
Come on!

44
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:04,344
Dan?

45
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,547
Dan?

46
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,963
Well, you're going to be all right.

47
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:41,382
We've got to get out.
Come on.

48
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,766
Come on.

49
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,514
Let's go home.

50
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,317
Morning, Gloria.

51
00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:52,455
How's the star patient?

52
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:54,036
Hello, Doctor.

53
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:56,834
You look great. I see you
even put on some makeup.

54
00:07:57,586 --> 00:07:58,833
Don't tease me.

55
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,210
It's just that...

56
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:05,465
My head is about the only
part of me that's not sick.

57
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:13,183
- Excuse me.
- This is Dr. West.

58
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:16,937
He'll be coordinating with
pathology about your biopsy.

59
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:20,392
You're right.
That part of you is quite well.

60
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:23,937
I'm scared.

61
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:27,736
Don't worry.
The surgery is routine.

62
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:30,535
I'll be taking
real good care of you.

63
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,894
She's not an experiment.

64
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,942
- She's terminal.
- She's a patient!

65
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:06,570
- She could be of use to us, Dan.
- Not us. You.

66
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:09,820
- I'm a doctor.
- Who will be a scientist.

67
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:37,427
Yes?

68
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:54,201
Lieutenant Leslie Chapham,
Arkham Police Department.

69
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:56,780
- Leslie?
- Lieutenant.

70
00:09:57,414 --> 00:10:00,242
Well, how may I help you,
Lieutenant?

71
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:04,044
I understand that you are in charge of the
remains from the night of the massacre?

72
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:08,216
Yes, but it's my understanding
that the case is closed.

73
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,543
Not to me.

74
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:25,983
It showed up in a carnival
sideshow just outside of Arkham.

75
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:27,401
Dr. Hill?

76
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:32,566
Remarkably well preserved, considering
the massacre was eight months ago.

77
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,827
All the specimens from that night
exhibit the same qualities.

78
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:40,828
Yes, as you see, the skull
is fractured right there.

79
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:43,535
Didn't you know it was missing?

80
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,161
You know,

81
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:48,338
I could fix that.

82
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,587
Where do you keep
the rest of the remains?

83
00:10:57,599 --> 00:11:00,052
The specimens from that night

84
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:03,687
have shown almost
no signs of deterioration.

85
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:06,607
This not only holds true
for the gross anatomy,

86
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:08,936
but the individual cells
in each specimen

87
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,780
display a lack of decay.

88
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,443
Are you saying
that they're not quite dead?

89
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,904
What's dead is dead, Lieutenant.

90
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:22,036
I should know.
It's my field.

91
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,377
What's this?

92
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:33,425
That's something
Dr. Hill was working on.

93
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:36,546
I haven't been able to identify it.

94
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,013
Yet.

95
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:41,058
I was planning on doing that first thing
in the morning, as a matter of fact.

96
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:43,512
Is this all of it?

97
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:47,190
- Except for fragments and debris.
- What happened to that?

98
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:50,276
Why, we burned them, of course.

99
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:02,155
Suicide.

100
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,331
Would-be ballet dancer
didn't have the stuff,

101
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,456
cut off her feet and bled to death.

102
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:10,789
Where are her feet?

103
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:12,582
Her feet?

104
00:12:12,924 --> 00:12:15,172
Why... they're missing.

105
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:19,638
A lot of stuff's been missing
from around here lately, Holmes.

106
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,301
Body parts?

107
00:12:24,602 --> 00:12:28,682
Really, Lieutenant?
Who would want to steal body parts?

108
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,921
Yes!

109
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:38,592
How did you get back here?

110
00:13:46,684 --> 00:13:47,885
Well...

111
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:51,639
well, well.

112
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,525
What do you think of the location of
the will in the brain now, Dr. Hill?

113
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:04,869
I'm sorry, what was that?

114
00:14:06,871 --> 00:14:09,915
Actually, you've been
quite useful to me.

115
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:15,373
You helped me prove that consciousness
resides in every part of the body.

116
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:25,095
You had such pretensions of
grandeur, you pompous plagiarist.

117
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,929
But look at you now.

118
00:14:28,643 --> 00:14:32,768
You're nothing but a dead-head.

119
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:39,855
A no-body.

120
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,807
Did that police officer find you?

121
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:09,583
Police?

122
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,708
Yes, he came by while
you were in surgery.

123
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,361
You're gonna be all right.

124
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,731
Gloria.

125
00:16:01,736 --> 00:16:02,937
Herbert!

126
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:37,305
Herbert?

127
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Dan!

128
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:08,093
Look at this!

129
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:13,846
We practically share a wall with
the Avril's crypt in the cemetery.

130
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,771
Yes, that's a 150 years of decay.

131
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,640
Oh, well.

132
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:22,892
Dust to dust.

133
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:32,659
- What happened to our cadaver?
- I was finished with it.

134
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,862
Would you help me
with this, please?

135
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:43,663
Security.

136
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:45,915
From what?

137
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:59,895
- Herbert, I've got something to tell you.
- Really?

138
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:02,019
I have something to show you.

139
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,094
Look at that, Dan.

140
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,593
And no tissue damage.

141
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:41,142
It simulates a heart attack.
And it leaves virtually no trace.

142
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,194
That's real useful if you
want to murder someone.

143
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,942
It is very useful...

144
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:53,525
in obtaining...

145
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:57,320
the freshest animal specimens.

146
00:18:58,287 --> 00:18:59,784
Right here.

147
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:06,127
The amniotic fluid
of the Cuzco iguana.

148
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:09,923
Did you know that this reptile has
not changed significantly in over...

149
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:12,968
a hundred million years.
Herbert, I know this is important.

150
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:14,295
Now...

151
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:19,475
we extract
the amniotic fluid from the sac.

152
00:19:20,017 --> 00:19:23,767
With that, we add the
muscle proteins of

153
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,019
myosin, actin and...

154
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:27,520
Tropomyosin.

155
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,269
Good.

156
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:32,646
And then...

157
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:50,335
Our reagent.

158
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:06,142
Pure potentiality.

159
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:10,769
The primordial ooze
from which life originates.

160
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:18,571
Dr. Hill...

161
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:21,369
Dr. Hill gave me this idea.

162
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:46,266
I'm moving out.

163
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:48,806
What?

164
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,108
I'm moving out.

165
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:54,603
Dan!

166
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:57,281
You can't turn back now.

167
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:00,075
This...

168
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:03,203
This is the key to creating life!

169
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:04,519
Parts! Reanimated parts!

170
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:07,229
We're trying to save
whole people, not parts.

171
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:11,083
Exactly, and what are people, Dan, over
and above a collection of living parts?

172
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:15,375
We can create...

173
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,340
new life.

174
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:39,695
This morbid doodling
with human body parts.

175
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:46,663
Is this what it's all about? Is this
what all our great work has led to?

176
00:21:46,664 --> 00:21:48,623
- Exactly what are you insinuating?
- This is your madness!

177
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:50,583
It had nothing to do with me.
I'm out!

178
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:54,421
I didn't see you rejecting my work
when Meg was lying there dead!

179
00:21:54,422 --> 00:21:57,421
- Where were your great ideals then?
- Don't you...

180
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,760
Daniel?

181
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,014
What was it about
Meg that you loved?

182
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,292
Meg's heart.

183
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:52,179
Help me...

184
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,978
to continue the work.

185
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:19,999
We can create a new life.

186
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:26,005
Starting...

187
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,427
with Meg's heart.

188
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,101
Yes.

189
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,731
Now, Dan.

190
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:47,656
You're going to have to help.

191
00:23:48,953 --> 00:23:50,450
At the hospital.

192
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:53,540
What about the police?

193
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:57,040
No, the police will
never come here.

194
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:30,865
- Daniel Cain?
- Yes.

195
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:38,744
Police?

196
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:51,556
Come on in.

197
00:24:56,604 --> 00:24:58,226
Is there a problem?

198
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,231
Who are you?

199
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:12,653
Dr. West.

200
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:16,414
Lieutenant Chapham.

201
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:17,616
Police.

202
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:20,331
What do you want?

203
00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:23,038
It's...

204
00:25:24,381 --> 00:25:26,633
quite an old place you got here.

205
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:28,301
It used to be a mortuary.

206
00:25:28,302 --> 00:25:31,429
After the cemetery filled up,
it was the caretaker's house.

207
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,133
Nobody's been here
for twenty years.

208
00:25:36,477 --> 00:25:38,304
Odd place to live.

209
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:40,723
Has its advantages.

210
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,401
Pretty morbid stuff.

211
00:25:48,572 --> 00:25:50,991
I don't consider science morbid.

212
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:54,369
It was pretty morbid
the night Dr. Carl Hill died.

213
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,698
And Dean... Dean...

214
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:03,921
- Halsey.
- Dean Halsey. Yeah.

215
00:26:04,338 --> 00:26:07,166
And Megan Halsey.

216
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,005
Do you mind if I sit down?

217
00:26:17,017 --> 00:26:21,347
Dr. West, what kind of problems
did you have with Dr. Carl Hill?

218
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,941
Dr. Hill and I
had professional differences.

219
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:28,066
It was nothing personal.
I have been all through this.

220
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:32,281
It's in the police records, which
lam certain you have access to.

221
00:26:32,282 --> 00:26:36,908
I understand that you have
some radical ideas about...

222
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:40,081
the reanimation of dead tissue?

223
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:45,169
When I was in medical school, I might
have had time to discuss the theory.

224
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,546
I don't anymore.

225
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:50,422
I suppose those poor souls
out at the Sefton Ward...

226
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:52,294
are theory.

227
00:26:57,725 --> 00:27:00,098
I don't know what
you're talking about.

228
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:12,823
And I suppose you don't know anything about
the missing body parts at the hospital?

229
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:16,492
Missing body parts?

230
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:20,364
No.

231
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,421
I can find my own way out.

232
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:15,854
Get off!

233
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,356
Get off!

234
00:29:18,949 --> 00:29:20,150
Get off!

235
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:21,693
Get off me!

236
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:24,613
Get off!

237
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,775
Ernest?

238
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:57,820
Dr. Graves
wants to see you right away.

239
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,608
- Pathology?
- Right away.

240
00:30:04,328 --> 00:30:07,281
- What about the...
- I'll take care of it.

241
00:30:08,665 --> 00:30:09,866
Cool.

242
00:30:56,338 --> 00:30:58,916
More.

243
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,001
Dr. Hill...

244
00:31:02,678 --> 00:31:04,004
Is that you?

245
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:06,590
More!

246
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,700
Dr. Graves.

247
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:27,865
You... you see?

248
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:31,491
I recognize you.

249
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,708
You do?

250
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:37,914
That seminar in Zurich...

251
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:39,380
Yes.

252
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:46,180
Your theory of reconciling
creationism...

253
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:50,681
with the origin of disease...

254
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:52,677
Yes.

255
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,347
Totally idiotic!

256
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:16,911
It's you, come in!

257
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:23,674
No, no.

258
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:24,876
No lights.

259
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:27,671
Come over here.

260
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,226
Dr. Hill?

261
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,561
Speak to me.

262
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:49,738
Speak to me, Dr. Hill!

263
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,078
Speak.

264
00:32:53,497 --> 00:32:56,291
This is some kind of joke,
right, man?

265
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,751
No, it is not a joke.

266
00:32:58,752 --> 00:33:00,211
He can talk.

267
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,380
He heard my lecture in Zurich.

268
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:05,174
The head?
He heard your lecture?

269
00:33:05,175 --> 00:33:07,753
He can talk, for God's sake!

270
00:33:08,512 --> 00:33:09,713
Listen.

271
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:12,807
Talk, damnit! Talk!

272
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:15,260
- Talk!
- The head...

273
00:33:26,113 --> 00:33:30,113
Don't you ever do that again,
you mental midget!

274
00:33:30,826 --> 00:33:33,870
Oh my God.
My God, I'm losing my mind.

275
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:39,122
I have some unfinished business.

276
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:45,083
And you will assist me.

277
00:33:47,884 --> 00:33:49,760
Not out the front door.

278
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:53,636
Just the doctor taking a
patient out for a little air.

279
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,440
- Man!
- Oh my God!

280
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,147
Herbert!

281
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:26,665
Hey, pooch.

282
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:32,425
Yes! You said "Hi" to him!

283
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:33,755
Francesca!

284
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:44,311
- Hi, Doctor.
- Hi.

285
00:34:45,108 --> 00:34:48,812
Don't let the little head
rule the big head, Dan.

286
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:55,944
So, what are you doing in Arkham?

287
00:34:56,411 --> 00:34:59,413
Oh, I'm doing some interviews
in Boston this week.

288
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:01,415
Dr. Cain, 5436.

289
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,167
Dr. Cain, 5436.

290
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:05,878
- Oh God. I've gotta go.
- I know.

291
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:07,080
Listen...

292
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,715
What about dinner tonight?

293
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,093
Only if you let me cook.

294
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,803
Real Italian style.

295
00:35:14,804 --> 00:35:17,848
Okay.
Only if you'll let me help.

296
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:20,594
Real American style.

297
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:23,934
- It's a deal.
- See you tonight.

298
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:25,728
Yeah.

299
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,604
Hope you like garlic!

300
00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:35,946
Well, Angel?

301
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:37,952
What do you think?

302
00:35:37,953 --> 00:35:39,951
What do you think?

303
00:35:40,455 --> 00:35:42,657
Hey, pooch.
Where did you come from?

304
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:44,909
From Peru.

305
00:35:45,794 --> 00:35:48,292
Is that where you met Dr. Cain?

306
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:53,714
Why do you want to know, Mr...

307
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:57,255
Lee Chapham.

308
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,341
Arkham Police.

309
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:04,053
Lieutenant.

310
00:36:06,815 --> 00:36:09,518
I'd like to talk to you about him.

311
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:15,246
Did you ever hear of the
"Miskatonic Massacre"?

312
00:36:15,272 --> 00:36:16,031
No, I haven't.

313
00:36:16,032 --> 00:36:18,610
It happened here at the hospital.

314
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:23,539
Eight months ago the department
got a call about a homicide

315
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,542
at the Miskatonic
University hospital.

316
00:36:26,543 --> 00:36:29,792
The whole place was in a panic.
It was down in the morgue.

317
00:36:30,297 --> 00:36:32,465
There was blood all over the walls.

318
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:34,885
You ever been around dead bodies?

319
00:36:38,513 --> 00:36:42,183
Then you know that stench
of decaying flesh.

320
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,855
Out of the darkness we were
attacked by a naked maniac.

321
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,982
He jumped right on my
partner and bit his arm.

322
00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:51,856
Nothing could make him come loose.

323
00:36:51,985 --> 00:36:53,777
Tore the muscle right off the bone

324
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,322
before we pumped enough lead
in him to make him stop.

325
00:37:03,496 --> 00:37:06,324
The dean of the medical
school was down there.

326
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,076
In pieces.

327
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:17,093
Also a prominent physician,
Dr. Carl Hill.

328
00:37:20,013 --> 00:37:21,931
We found only his head.

329
00:37:22,682 --> 00:37:25,977
The rest of his body
was just part of the muck.

330
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:30,098
Funny thing though:

331
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:35,358
His head, when I
found it, was still...

332
00:37:36,529 --> 00:37:37,730
twitching.

333
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:39,315
Twitching?

334
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:41,492
The doctors had a lot of
highfalutin explanations.

335
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:43,869
Postmortem involuntary spasm...

336
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,071
I don't know.

337
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:50,076
But I've seen my
share of the dead.

338
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:55,632
And I never saw
a twitching like that before.

339
00:37:57,342 --> 00:37:59,968
They blamed it all
on these ones in here.

340
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:01,591
The funny thing is:

341
00:38:02,055 --> 00:38:04,890
There's a death certificate at the
hospital for each one of these.

342
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:06,266
A death certificate?

343
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:10,563
I mean to say these three didn't get
to the morgue on their own two feet.

344
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,396
The hospital made a mistake?

345
00:38:18,947 --> 00:38:22,401
The hospital might have made
a mistake about those two.

346
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,281
Not...

347
00:38:28,957 --> 00:38:30,374
But not this one.

348
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:34,045
I know about this one.

349
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,291
She was my wife.

350
00:38:39,134 --> 00:38:40,506
I'm sorry.

351
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,131
Elizabeth, stop!

352
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:47,058
Get off me!

353
00:38:56,818 --> 00:39:00,022
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm all right. Thanks.

354
00:39:03,783 --> 00:39:04,984
That's enough.

355
00:39:05,535 --> 00:39:07,745
She's never done
anything like that before.

356
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:08,947
Just...

357
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:12,124
What does all this
have to do with Daniel?

358
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:16,296
Dr. Cain and Dr. West were the only
normal survivors of that night.

359
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:19,625
Daniel's girlfriend was Meg Halsey,
the dean's daughter.

360
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:24,216
And Daniel was found with
her dead body in his arms.

361
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:26,889
Her dead body.

362
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:28,883
Twitching.

363
00:39:29,726 --> 00:39:31,599
Like that blasted head.

364
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:55,000
Not too much, we don't want
premature reanimation.

365
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:57,670
Thank you, I've never
done this before.

366
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,471
Yes.

367
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:23,229
Good.

368
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:33,578
The circulation is going to work.

369
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:38,128
God damnit, Herbert!

370
00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:44,171
What are we
doing here anyway?

371
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,094
Why don't we just publish our findings?
We could get grant money.

372
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,555
Because they would never
understand our methods.

373
00:40:49,556 --> 00:40:52,475
Besides that, they
would steal the work.

374
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:55,599
It's never gonna work.

375
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,939
She's gonna be
uncontrollably spastic.

376
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,984
Unless we reanimate all the limbs
at the same time, they'll separate.

377
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:05,195
That's why we inject
directly into the heart.

378
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:08,198
The circulatory system
should distribute the reagent

379
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:12,245
to all the various limbs and
effect reanimation concurrently.

380
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,289
- We've never done that before.
- I know that.

381
00:41:15,832 --> 00:41:18,501
No, I don't want to
gamble with Meg's heart.

382
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,398
Oh God...

383
00:41:42,317 --> 00:41:44,440
- Ciao, dottore. Come va?
- Francesca...

384
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:51,366
Sorry about the place.
I didn't have any time to...

385
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:54,446
- Did I come too early?
- No! No, no, no, no.

386
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,868
God, you look great.

387
00:42:00,627 --> 00:42:04,206
Open this up, will you?
It's a Chianti, 1987.

388
00:42:06,174 --> 00:42:09,628
- So, where is the kitchen?
- It's right over here.

389
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:15,843
- Did you have any trouble finding it?
- Oh, no. The cemetery made it real easy.

390
00:42:31,908 --> 00:42:34,110
This is my special sauce.

391
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:35,987
Here.

392
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:44,371
- What do you think? You like it?
- I love it.

393
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,622
So do I.

394
00:45:18,783 --> 00:45:19,984
Come on.

395
00:45:56,904 --> 00:45:58,481
You're so beautiful.

396
00:46:03,286 --> 00:46:05,079
Your skin's so soft.

397
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:10,409
So warm.

398
00:46:42,658 --> 00:46:44,952
What are you doing here?

399
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:53,286
What do you want?

400
00:46:55,713 --> 00:46:58,048
The body you took
from the crematorium.

401
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:00,251
Get out of here.
Right now.

402
00:47:04,096 --> 00:47:05,468
What's down here?

403
00:47:07,308 --> 00:47:09,510
That's none of your business.

404
00:47:34,043 --> 00:47:36,371
You are making a big mistake.

405
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:39,335
Do you believe...

406
00:47:39,882 --> 00:47:41,880
that dead is dead,

407
00:47:42,635 --> 00:47:43,961
Dr. West?

408
00:47:44,971 --> 00:47:50,018
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I am talking about my wife!

409
00:47:51,727 --> 00:47:54,271
No! You can't go in there.

410
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:55,940
- Move.
- No.

411
00:47:56,399 --> 00:47:58,021
Move!

412
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:48,526
You...

413
00:48:50,286 --> 00:48:51,612
butcher!

414
00:48:51,746 --> 00:48:54,415
How dare you judge my work?

415
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:56,496
"Work"?

416
00:48:58,544 --> 00:49:01,122
Was my wife your "work"?

417
00:49:01,255 --> 00:49:03,798
- Don't lay your guilt on me, Lieutenant!
- What?

418
00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:06,593
Your wife died of multiple
contusions to the head.

419
00:49:06,594 --> 00:49:08,303
- From a blunt instrument.
- No.

420
00:49:08,304 --> 00:49:10,764
- Multiple blows to the head!
- She fell!

421
00:49:10,765 --> 00:49:12,262
She fell, did she?

422
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:16,513
That was not my fault!

423
00:49:34,955 --> 00:49:36,156
What happened?

424
00:49:36,832 --> 00:49:38,158
He attacked me.

425
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:42,087
No, Dan! Dan! I can't help
it if his heart gave out!

426
00:49:42,088 --> 00:49:43,961
God, Herbert, he's a cop!

427
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:46,584
You...

428
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,343
What are we gonna do with him?

429
00:49:52,306 --> 00:49:53,507
Well...

430
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:57,511
We could get him
back out on the street.

431
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:58,971
Walking.

432
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,070
You don't wanna gamble
with Meg's heart.

433
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:10,866
This is our opportunity for a test.
Do you wanna waste it?

434
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:20,118
How much do you think
he weighs? 230, 240?

435
00:50:26,048 --> 00:50:28,751
So little tissue damage.

436
00:50:29,552 --> 00:50:31,299
Oh, Dan?

437
00:50:34,056 --> 00:50:35,883
Just in case.

438
00:50:46,402 --> 00:50:47,603
Daniel?

439
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,320
It's working.

440
00:51:03,544 --> 00:51:05,621
Get away from me with that cloth!

441
00:51:09,008 --> 00:51:10,551
No! Dan!

442
00:51:16,557 --> 00:51:19,601
He's a wife-beater, Dan!
Use the gun!

443
00:52:10,402 --> 00:52:11,319
Dan?

444
00:52:11,445 --> 00:52:12,612
Herbert?

445
00:52:35,636 --> 00:52:37,133
Lieutenant Chapham!

446
00:52:37,638 --> 00:52:39,340
What are you doing here?

447
00:52:43,143 --> 00:52:45,095
Herbert!

448
00:52:54,446 --> 00:52:57,525
No! Stop!

449
00:53:02,204 --> 00:53:03,405
Stop!

450
00:53:03,706 --> 00:53:05,203
Get away from me!

451
00:53:05,332 --> 00:53:06,533
Get out!

452
00:53:06,834 --> 00:53:08,377
Get away...

453
00:53:42,077 --> 00:53:43,278
What happened?

454
00:53:52,087 --> 00:53:53,288
Is he gone?

455
00:53:54,256 --> 00:53:56,834
What is going on here?

456
00:54:01,138 --> 00:54:04,012
What did you do to him
to make him that way?

457
00:54:04,683 --> 00:54:06,009
She's hysterical.

458
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:10,893
What did you do to him?
Why?

459
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:53,913
What are you doing down here?

460
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:57,959
Your welcome does not extend
to this part of the house.

461
00:56:00,174 --> 00:56:01,375
Angel?

462
00:56:03,218 --> 00:56:04,419
Sweetie.

463
00:56:15,564 --> 00:56:17,186
Get out of my way!

464
00:56:17,316 --> 00:56:20,611
- You should never have brought her here.
- Get that thing out of here!

465
00:56:20,736 --> 00:56:22,236
Francesca, wait! Let me explain.

466
00:56:22,237 --> 00:56:24,565
Is this what you did to Meg?

467
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,362
You're a freak!

468
00:56:27,451 --> 00:56:29,119
God, I hate you!

469
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,044
You're better off without her.

470
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:57,431
Dan.

471
00:56:57,731 --> 00:56:59,228
Now listen to me.

472
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,570
All we need is just one last piece.

473
00:57:06,114 --> 00:57:07,315
Dan?

474
00:57:10,786 --> 00:57:11,987
Gloria?

475
00:57:12,579 --> 00:57:13,780
Hi.

476
00:57:20,629 --> 00:57:22,422
How are you feeling today?

477
00:57:32,266 --> 00:57:33,467
You see,

478
00:57:34,476 --> 00:57:37,850
it helps me to think of you as Meg.

479
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:42,646
Meg who lived.

480
00:58:00,586 --> 00:58:01,503
Nurse!

481
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:05,458
Paddles!

482
00:58:09,177 --> 00:58:12,847
I didn't even notice.
God, what's wrong with me?

483
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:14,549
Let me through!

484
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:17,594
Give me that!

485
00:58:18,312 --> 00:58:19,513
Clear!

486
00:58:20,647 --> 00:58:21,973
Push the lidocaine!

487
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:26,520
Clear!

488
00:58:28,447 --> 00:58:29,694
Forget it, Dan.

489
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:31,191
Let's go in.

490
00:58:42,419 --> 00:58:45,713
- She's never gonna survive this.
- She's already dead, Dan.

491
00:58:45,714 --> 00:58:47,882
No, you're off midline.

492
00:58:47,883 --> 00:58:49,084
Damnit!

493
00:58:57,351 --> 00:58:58,851
I'm getting nothing.

494
00:58:58,852 --> 00:59:00,053
I'm sorry.

495
00:59:00,187 --> 00:59:01,388
Come on!

496
00:59:03,398 --> 00:59:05,475
- Anything?
- Still flat.

497
00:59:07,361 --> 00:59:08,608
I'm calling it.

498
00:59:08,737 --> 00:59:10,405
No!

499
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:15,318
Not again.

500
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:32,752
Go home.

501
00:59:37,015 --> 00:59:39,718
Go home.

502
00:59:59,746 --> 01:00:00,947
Yes.

503
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:03,367
Come to room 613.
Right away.

504
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:42,451
Damn you, West!

505
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:46,034
Wilbur!

506
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:48,335
- Get me out of here!
- No.

507
01:00:48,336 --> 01:00:50,379
West took my body,

508
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,708
but he cannot take my mind.

509
01:00:52,924 --> 01:00:54,751
Take me to him!

510
01:00:55,969 --> 01:00:57,170
No.

511
01:00:57,387 --> 01:00:59,055
Just don't talk.

512
01:00:59,556 --> 01:01:01,303
Don't say anything.

513
01:01:09,191 --> 01:01:14,192
Don't make me get someone else.

514
01:01:40,097 --> 01:01:42,049
What do you think you're doing?

515
01:01:42,182 --> 01:01:43,383
Stop!

516
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:47,353
Do as I say, you nincompoop!

517
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:53,689
Come on, come on.

518
01:01:55,737 --> 01:01:57,610
You're going away now.

519
01:02:05,372 --> 01:02:07,791
Now, now...

520
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:17,876
Yo, Dr. West.

521
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:19,882
Let's get this.

522
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:24,466
No, no. You get the feet.

523
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:27,473
I'll get the head.

524
01:02:34,818 --> 01:02:36,611
Was she goog-looking, Doc?

525
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:57,339
You take this to the crematorium.

526
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,925
The crematorium?
You mean pathology.

527
01:02:59,926 --> 01:03:01,503
I mean crematorium.

528
01:03:07,392 --> 01:03:09,686
Well, excuse me!

529
01:03:12,397 --> 01:03:14,975
Excuse me,
have you seen Dr. Cain?

530
01:03:15,984 --> 01:03:17,151
He left.

531
01:03:17,152 --> 01:03:18,774
For the day, I think.

532
01:03:18,904 --> 01:03:20,902
Is there something wrong?

533
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:22,653
He's very upset.

534
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:24,610
He lost a patient.

535
01:03:25,202 --> 01:03:28,121
I've never known a doctor
that cared so much.

536
01:03:30,498 --> 01:03:31,699
Yeah.

537
01:03:38,506 --> 01:03:41,550
Now, Dan, I'm going to
need your help with this.

538
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:42,752
Understand?

539
01:03:46,223 --> 01:03:48,642
This is for you, too.

540
01:03:51,436 --> 01:03:52,978
Gloria! No...

541
01:03:52,979 --> 01:03:55,856
Dan, don't quit on me now, please.

542
01:03:55,857 --> 01:03:59,026
It's going to take the two of us to
fuse the brain to the spinal cord.

543
01:03:59,027 --> 01:04:01,070
- No!
- Dan, look!

544
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:04,198
Look what we've done.

545
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:07,110
Meg's heart is going to beat again.

546
01:04:07,702 --> 01:04:11,372
Others dare not dream
what we are about to do.

547
01:04:12,874 --> 01:04:14,075
Dan.

548
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,040
The feet...

549
01:04:21,299 --> 01:04:23,342
of a young ballet dancer...

550
01:04:23,843 --> 01:04:27,422
who ended her life when
she lost her ambition.

551
01:04:29,724 --> 01:04:30,925
These legs...

552
01:04:32,352 --> 01:04:33,929
walked the streets.

553
01:04:34,562 --> 01:04:38,858
You remember the hooker who was killed
in the E.R. by her pimp last week?

554
01:04:39,651 --> 01:04:42,445
Think of all the bodies these
legs have wrapped around.

555
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:44,697
What was the value of her life?

556
01:04:44,698 --> 01:04:47,825
To end up being picked apart
by the likes of Dr. Graves

557
01:04:47,826 --> 01:04:49,448
and his bumbling students?

558
01:04:50,996 --> 01:04:52,197
And here,

559
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:55,124
the womb of the virgin.

560
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:58,829
Struck down before
tasting the pleasures of life.

561
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:01,581
Remember?

562
01:05:03,049 --> 01:05:04,250
Her skin.

563
01:05:05,343 --> 01:05:06,715
So soft.

564
01:05:08,221 --> 01:05:09,673
So warm.

565
01:05:11,766 --> 01:05:14,560
But so cold in death.

566
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:20,475
The arms of a waitress.

567
01:05:23,695 --> 01:05:25,613
The lawyer's hand.

568
01:05:27,824 --> 01:05:29,071
Case dismissed.

569
01:05:33,204 --> 01:05:37,705
And look at this delicate piece.

570
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:40,787
What do you think?

571
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:43,706
A sculptress?

572
01:05:45,216 --> 01:05:46,417
A harpist?

573
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,175
Would you believe...

574
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,053
a murderess?

575
01:05:59,147 --> 01:06:01,190
But they're all equal now.

576
01:06:01,983 --> 01:06:06,108
Nothing but cast-off remnants
of a meaningless existence.

577
01:06:10,408 --> 01:06:11,609
Even her.

578
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,822
How beautiful is this face?

579
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:19,288
Oh, yes.

580
01:06:20,794 --> 01:06:21,995
She...

581
01:06:23,088 --> 01:06:25,086
was special.

582
01:06:26,591 --> 01:06:27,792
Yes.

583
01:06:29,636 --> 01:06:30,837
Just...

584
01:06:31,137 --> 01:06:32,338
dead...

585
01:06:32,847 --> 01:06:34,048
tissue.

586
01:06:35,767 --> 01:06:37,719
But in our hands...

587
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:41,643
it's the clay of life.

588
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:45,230
Within this chest,

589
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:48,985
Meg's heart will beat again.

590
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:03,202
Good.

591
01:07:05,463 --> 01:07:07,040
Let's get to work.

592
01:07:22,564 --> 01:07:23,765
Who's there?

593
01:07:58,558 --> 01:08:00,476
I didn't do anything.

594
01:08:03,271 --> 01:08:04,768
Oh, no.

595
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:08,400
You disappoint me,

596
01:08:08,401 --> 01:08:10,695
Dr. Graves.

597
01:08:11,946 --> 01:08:13,147
Please.

598
01:08:14,365 --> 01:08:15,566
On the table!

599
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:20,530
- No!
- Yes!

600
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:25,702
Scalpel.

601
01:08:56,324 --> 01:08:57,525
Left!

602
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,800
Get off me!
Let me go! Get off me!

603
01:09:14,801 --> 01:09:17,550
What's the matter?
Don't you like me?

604
01:09:19,639 --> 01:09:21,682
No! Let me go!

605
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,261
No!

606
01:09:25,395 --> 01:09:26,972
Cain, West.

607
01:09:27,105 --> 01:09:30,024
- They did this to me!
- Let the fuck go!

608
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,355
And they'll pay!

609
01:09:33,194 --> 01:09:35,821
Please, let me out!

610
01:09:35,822 --> 01:09:37,740
Let me out, please!

611
01:09:37,865 --> 01:09:40,409
Please let me out! Please!

612
01:09:43,413 --> 01:09:45,707
- Oh my God!
- Get security!

613
01:10:19,407 --> 01:10:20,608
Well...

614
01:10:21,034 --> 01:10:24,113
if it had always been
as fresh as the head, but...

615
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:29,208
I think we're ready, Dan.

616
01:10:29,334 --> 01:10:30,535
Good.

617
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,803
Sounds like rats in the wall.

618
01:10:45,642 --> 01:10:46,843
Rats?

619
01:10:48,353 --> 01:10:49,554
Yes.

620
01:10:50,355 --> 01:10:51,852
That's what it is.

621
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,728
The little buggers
better stay put or I'll...

622
01:11:04,118 --> 01:11:06,616
We start with the heart.

623
01:11:22,095 --> 01:11:24,343
And God created woman.

624
01:11:31,562 --> 01:11:32,763
Let me.

625
01:12:19,318 --> 01:12:20,519
Time?

626
01:12:21,654 --> 01:12:23,572
- Time?
- 15 seconds.

627
01:12:37,795 --> 01:12:39,463
45 seconds.

628
01:12:54,812 --> 01:12:57,106
Three minutes, 15 seconds.

629
01:12:58,107 --> 01:12:59,980
It's going to take time.

630
01:13:04,489 --> 01:13:05,690
Damnit!

631
01:13:07,158 --> 01:13:08,359
Not now.

632
01:16:35,908 --> 01:16:37,576
Breathe.

633
01:16:43,207 --> 01:16:44,408
Breathe.

634
01:16:50,965 --> 01:16:52,166
Yes.

635
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:54,543
Breathe.

636
01:16:55,678 --> 01:16:56,879
Breathe.

637
01:16:59,974 --> 01:17:01,175
Breathe.

638
01:17:02,143 --> 01:17:03,560
Stay with me.

639
01:17:04,228 --> 01:17:05,429
Yes.

640
01:17:07,523 --> 01:17:08,724
Yes.

641
01:18:09,502 --> 01:18:10,703
You're alive.

642
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:28,137
Alive...

643
01:20:03,741 --> 01:20:05,238
Herbert!

644
01:20:43,948 --> 01:20:45,775
I made you.

645
01:20:47,368 --> 01:20:49,244
Daniel!

646
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:50,446
She's alive.

647
01:20:51,205 --> 01:20:52,281
They're coming!

648
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:54,116
Now!

649
01:20:56,168 --> 01:20:58,166
Dan! Get her out of here!

650
01:20:58,295 --> 01:21:01,089
Freeze! Police!

651
01:21:02,091 --> 01:21:03,292
What?

652
01:21:05,552 --> 01:21:06,753
Francesca, go!

653
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:19,274
Dan, help me!

654
01:21:44,008 --> 01:21:45,881
No! This!

655
01:21:53,517 --> 01:21:54,718
Get this!

656
01:21:59,565 --> 01:22:00,766
Yes.

657
01:22:30,554 --> 01:22:31,926
Who is she?

658
01:22:34,016 --> 01:22:35,342
It's Meg.

659
01:22:36,643 --> 01:22:38,220
Meg is dead.

660
01:22:44,401 --> 01:22:45,602
Dan!

661
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:52,401
My God, they're using tools!

662
01:23:15,057 --> 01:23:17,385
What have you done in here?

663
01:23:17,518 --> 01:23:19,937
We created a life.

664
01:23:21,188 --> 01:23:23,231
- You made her?
- Yes.

665
01:23:23,232 --> 01:23:26,567
Dead pieces of this.
With my hands I created

666
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:30,363
what no man's mind or woman's
womb could ever hope to achieve.

667
01:23:30,948 --> 01:23:32,866
This is blasphemy!

668
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:36,870
Blasphemy?
Before what God?

669
01:23:37,371 --> 01:23:42,577
A God repulsed by the miserable
humanity he created in his own image?

670
01:23:42,835 --> 01:23:46,835
I will not be shackled
by the failures of your God.

671
01:23:47,172 --> 01:23:51,502
The only blasphemy
is to wallow in insignificance.

672
01:23:52,094 --> 01:23:56,264
I have taken refuse
of your God's failures

673
01:23:56,265 --> 01:23:58,718
and I have triumphed.

674
01:24:00,018 --> 01:24:01,219
There!

675
01:24:01,478 --> 01:24:04,648
There is my creation!

676
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:08,568
He made me.

677
01:24:13,157 --> 01:24:16,076
Open up! Open!

678
01:24:17,202 --> 01:24:18,574
Dan?

679
01:24:18,704 --> 01:24:20,906
We've got to fight them off.

680
01:24:22,082 --> 01:24:23,784
Leave him alone!

681
01:24:24,126 --> 01:24:25,748
Listen to me!

682
01:24:56,909 --> 01:24:59,362
Your girlfriend
doesn't stand a chance.

683
01:25:00,996 --> 01:25:02,573
Our girl is superior.

684
01:25:14,009 --> 01:25:15,210
Help!

685
01:25:16,595 --> 01:25:18,797
Leave her alone, you monster!

686
01:25:21,934 --> 01:25:25,308
Forget it, Dan. She's just an
assembly of dead tissue.

687
01:25:37,324 --> 01:25:38,866
You made me.

688
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:40,910
I made you!

689
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:44,330
Don't! Dan, wait!

690
01:25:44,331 --> 01:25:45,953
Don't! Dan, wait!

691
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:11,357
Don't you want me?

692
01:26:13,819 --> 01:26:16,442
I don't want your body!

693
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:28,117
Then what do you want?

694
01:26:55,402 --> 01:26:58,526
Is this what you want?

695
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:00,152
You're not...

696
01:27:00,782 --> 01:27:01,983
Meg.

697
01:27:02,659 --> 01:27:04,111
Meg's dead.

698
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:10,743
No!

699
01:27:20,927 --> 01:27:22,094
Out of the way!

700
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:24,514
You're next, you little squirt!

701
01:27:55,754 --> 01:27:57,422
Make a note of it, Dan!

702
01:28:00,967 --> 01:28:02,919
"Tissue rejection!"

703
01:28:10,602 --> 01:28:12,725
My wife understands, really.

704
01:28:28,537 --> 01:28:29,738
Francesca!

705
01:28:36,002 --> 01:28:37,203
West!

706
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:41,174
You stupid biped!

707
01:28:47,097 --> 01:28:48,014
No.

708
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,801
Get back!

709
01:28:52,602 --> 01:28:53,849
How dare you!

710
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:00,523
You're under arrest!

711
01:29:08,368 --> 01:29:10,445
Get off!
Get off of me!

712
01:29:14,332 --> 01:29:15,533
No!

713
01:29:19,755 --> 01:29:21,207
Oh my God, Dan.

714
01:29:56,041 --> 01:30:00,041
Are we having fun, yet?

715
01:30:20,106 --> 01:30:22,559
Get off of me, you rejects!

716
01:30:32,077 --> 01:30:34,496
It's over, West!
