1
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,433
<i>Do you like your present?</i>

2
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:38,626
<i>Yeah.</i>

3
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,466
What's wrong, Michael?

4
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,732
It reminds me of something.

5
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,142
What? What does it remind you of?

6
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,814
Just a dream
that I had last night.

7
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,683
What kind of dream? Was it a
good dream or was it a bad dream?

8
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,151
It was a good dream.
A really good dream.

9
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,018
You were dressed in all white,
like a ghost.

10
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,092
Like a really beautiful ghost.

11
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:06,459
You were walking down this white
hallway with this big white horse

12
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,567
saying you were gonna come
and take me back home.

13
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,504
I wish I could take you
home, honey. I miss you there.

14
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,798
I miss you too.
Aw.

15
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,840
Whenever you look at the horse,
you can think of Mommy, okay?

16
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,279
Okay.
Okay.

17
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,214
Are you ticklish?
No.

18
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,353
I forgot. I thought you were.
No, I'm not.

19
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,723
Yes, you are. That's
the face I wanna see.

20
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,722
Okay? Cheer up.
Okay.

21
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,792
All right.
Okay. No more gloom.

22
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,156
Okay.
Okay.

23
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:39,999


24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,428


25
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,033


26
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,227


27
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,836


28
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,787
Laurie?

29
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,585
Laurie, is that you?

30
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,354
Laurie? Laurie?

31
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,862
Stop, stop. Stop, stop, sweetie. Stop.

32
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,591
Stop.
It's Sheriff Brackett.

33
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,465
Laurie, give me the gun.

34
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,040
That's it.
Just give me the gun.

35
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,835
That's it. Easy.

36
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,309
Easy, sweetie. Easy.

37
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,311
I killed him.

38
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,381


39
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,246
The man.

40
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:12,156
I climbed in the wall, I fell.

41
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,149
Okay. All right, sweetie.

42
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,419
Sweetie. It's okay.
I killed him.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I killed him.
It's okay.
It's all right. It's all
right. It's all right.
I want you to come with me,
okay?

44
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,564


45
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,760
Please!

46
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,375
What is happening?
Where am I? Where am I?

47
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,550


48
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:44,981
We're gonna need Neuro,
Ortho, Trauma, X-ray!

49
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,488
Am I...? Am I gonna die?

50
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,693
Am I gonna die?!

51
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,419
Am I...? Am I gonna die?

52
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,190
Heads up,
everybody. Clear. Make a path.

53
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,428
We're losing
him. Altered mental status,

54
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,161
unknown injury.
BP is 79 over 40.

55
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,638
On my count we're
gonna move her. Ready?

56
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,645
And one, two, three.

57
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,044


58
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,778
We need CBC chem panel.

59
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,421
Hucks.

60
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,719
How many?

61
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,083
Two.

62
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,289
They heavy?

63
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,729
What the hell
happened to this kid anyway?

64
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,205


65
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,375
I don't know. I thought it
was a car accident. I'm very confused.

66
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,305
At least
Neurosurgery cleared her head.

67
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:39,978
We don't have to do anything
with that.

68
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,578
Right.

69
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:48,050
She's gonna need Plastic, but that's
the least of her worries right now.

70
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,719
Come on. GARY: Pull me down the stairs.

71
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,625
- Lift up your end.
- Come on, pull it up.

72
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,716
Cut.

73
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:32,291
On three. Nice
and easy. One, two, three!

74
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,625


75
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:36,590
Let's go feet first.

76
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,327
Feels like he's made of lead.

77
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,905
Wait, wait, wait. Pick him up.

78
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,370
Oh, Jesus Christ.

79
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,906
He weighs a ton.

80
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,606
Looks good.

81
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,078
It'll hold. At least for now.

82
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,581
Strap him down tight.

83
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,348
I don't need that behemoth
banging around back there.

84
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,994
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This ain't
my first fucking corpse, rodeo.

85
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,595
Just close it
up when you're done.

86
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,697
When the boys get him
over to county,

87
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,060
just make sure that
they lock the place up tight.

88
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,930
I don't want any surprises
till I get there in the morning.

89
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,629
No problem. On first sight,

90
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,173
I'd say cause of death
is fairly obvious.

91
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,404
I'd say that there's nothing obvious
about anything that happened here tonight.

92
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,479
Not a goddamn thing.

93
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,151
The son of a bitch
was heavy, huh?

94
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,885
Six guys to lift one stiff.

95
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,393
That's one for the books.

96
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,531
Technically,
five guys and a girl.

97
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,568
Whatever.

98
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,268
Did you get a look
at the naked chick?

99
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:53,673
Man, she was F-I-N-E, fine.

100
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,512
Yeah. She still looked fresh.

101
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,982
I heard a story about
a couple of meat wagon boys

102
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,318
fucking corpses over in Essex.

103
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,630
I ain't never had the urge
till tonight.

104
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,095
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, whoa!
Whoa. Come on!

105
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,996
Brackett even thinks he hears
you joking about that

106
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,400
and you're out of here on your ass.
I wouldn't ever do it.

107
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,173
Oh, yeah?
I'm just saying.

108
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,311
She still looked good to me.
Nice little titties hanging out.

109
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,845
Come on, that's disgusting. Stop it.
I got wood just Ziploc'ing her up.

110
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,041
Stop. Shut up. Please.

111
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,381
I'm just saying, man.

112
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,356
Hey.
Huh?

113
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,125
What's the difference
between jam and jelly?

114
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,696
I don't know. What?

115
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,629
You can't jelly your cock
up a dead girl's ass.

116
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,236
I knew that one.

117
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,937
Cow! Cow!

118
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,887
Shit. Oh, shit.

119
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,991
Oh, fuck. Hooks. Hooks.

120
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,026
Hooks. Hooks.

121
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,296
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

122
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,870
Fuck! Fuck. Fuck.

123
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,032
Oh, God.

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Fuck. Fuck.

125
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,249
Fuck!

126
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,653
Oh, fuck!

127
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,733
Help me! Help me!

128
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,270
Hooks.

129
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:41,776
Hooks, Hooks, Hooks.
Hooks, Hooks.

130
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,252
Help me. Help please.

131
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,592
Help me.

132
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,923
Help. Help.

133
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,701
Please, help. Help me!

134
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,601
Help me. Hey.

135
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:17,129
So I told her. I said, "Girl, if you
think I'm letting you handle Thanksgiving,

136
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,497
then I'm ordering Chinese."

137
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,469
Octavia, it's a pleasure that
you're embracing life this way.

138
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,869
I love seeing you.

139
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,634
She's bringing Miriam down.

140
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,813
Not the dog!
That yapping dog that peed

141
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,776
all over my new couch.

142
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,610
You are gonna have to
cook that dog for Thanksgiving.

143
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,016
Honey, I'm gonna leave.

144
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,284
Hold down the fort.
All right, doc.

145
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,425
I'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.

146
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,693
Annie?

147
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,833
Oh, Annie.

148
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,435
Oh, baby.

149
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,577
Oh, Annie.

150
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,484
Oh, Annie. Please don't die.
Please, please, please don't die.

151
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,786
Please, Miss Strode.

152
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,623
You cannot be in here.

153
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,890
I just wanted to sit here with her.
Please, I won't bother her.

154
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,796
Mm-mm. You need to go
back to your own room.

155
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,561
You need to rest
just as much as she does.

156
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,467
Please. Please Just a few minutes.
Just a few minutes. Please.

157
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,904
Come on.
Let's get you back into bed.

158
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:35,136
You're doing good, sweetie.
Doing good. All right.

159
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,384
<i>Nurse Daniels,
please report to Emergency Room A.</i>

160
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,849
Oh. Honey, do you need my
help getting back to your room?

161
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,043
I'm fine.

162
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,723
<i>Nurse Daniels, please
report to Emergency Room A.</i>

163
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,599
Nurse, I...

164
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,406
I need something for my head.

165
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,303
Hello?

166
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,416
I'm getting really dizzy.

167
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,873
Nurse, I need something
for my head.

168
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,248
Help!

169
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,254
Help!

170
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,904
Help! Somebody! Please!

171
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,699
Help! Help!

172
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,598
Help, somebody!

173
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,739
Help, somebody!

174
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,134
Please!

175
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,349
Help!

176
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,553
Somebody, please.

177
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,820
Help me!

178
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,466
Help!

179
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,710
Help me!

180
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,760
Oh, goddamn it.

181
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,928
This is just fucking great.

182
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,016
Help me, please! Help me!
Oh, my God!

183
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,087
What the Christ are you doing here?
Please help. Help me, please.

184
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,156
You're gonna freeze
your ass off out here.

185
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,123
Please! Please! Please!
Here, easy.

186
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,387
Look, just sit down. Here, here.
- Please!

187
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:10,261
Here, now. Put this on before they
blame me for you catching pneumonia.

188
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,300
The nurse is dead.
The nurse is...

189
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,530
No, no, it's going to be okay.
Listen, it's going to be all right.

190
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,732
I work here.
My name is Buddy.

191
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,934
Okay, it's going to be fine.
No. No, it's not.

192
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,635
I've gotta get you back.
No, it's... No, it's...

193
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:25,180
Just let me go get my car, okay?
Please! Please!

194
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,942
It'll just take a second.
No, no!

195
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,586
No, honey,
it'll just take a second.

196
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,154
Please don't leave me. Please.
The car is right out there.

197
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,086
Look, look, here.
Here, here.

198
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,729
Just drink what's left of this
till I get back, okay?

199
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,727
Okay? And I promise,
I'll be back in just a second.

200
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,593
- No, please.
- Okay, just don't...

201
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,893
Nobody's gonna hurt you, honey.

202
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:49,665
It'll be all right. Here,
I'm gonna lock this door, okay?

203
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:50,864
One second,

204
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,871
and then I will pull up
right here, okay?

205
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,809
All right.

206
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,485
Buddy!

207
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,186
Buddy, please.

208
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,791
Buddy, please come back!

209
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,231
Buddy!

210
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,851
Buddy!

211
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,064
I'm sorry.

212
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,600
This old car doesn't always
like to start,

213
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
especially in the rain.
Everything will be fine, okay?

214
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,103
No! Buddy!

215
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,947


216
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

217
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,140


218
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,318


219
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:22,126
Somebody! Somebody, please!

220
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,444
Help me! Help me, please!

221
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,781


222
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,920
No!

223
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,807


224
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,472
Come on.

225
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,876
He's dead.

226
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,881
He's fucking dead.

227
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,218
Oh, fuck.

228
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,356
Oh, God.

229
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,747
I am running ragged this morning.

230
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,113
Morning.
Running ragged.

231
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,379
Good morning.

232
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,456
Did you hear Laurie last night?
Yes, Dad.

233
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:04,755
I hear her every night. Please,
God, don't say anything to her.

234
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,897
I won't. I won't.

235
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,121
Want some egg whites?

236
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:12,360
No. I think I'm gonna get me one
of them sticky buns on the way in.

237
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,131
That's great.
Pastry for breakfast.

238
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,207
Seriously, 500 calories
of sugar and shit.

239
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,241
I know it, I know it.

240
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:21,935
- Morning.
- Morning.

241
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,409
Good morning, sunshine.

242
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,243
I got to go.
Hey, slow your roll for one second.

243
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,919
Please do not forget
to pick up the pizza.

244
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,246
And whole-wheat crust.

245
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,080
God, Annie.

246
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,953
Why don't we just have them take
the cheese and put it on cardboard?

247
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,493
Aren't you late?
Cardboard's got a lot of fiber.

248
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,722
And it's cheap.
No meat.

249
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,234
Rough night?

250
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,931
Did you hear me?

251
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,673
Mm. Just a little.

252
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:56,472
God. Just when I think I can get back to
something as simple as sleep, it's like...

253
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,213
Right back at me.

254
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,451
Do you wanna tell me about it?

255
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,715
Nah.

256
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,357
I don't remember much.

257
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,685
It was a hospital one.

258
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:13,153
I haven't had one of those
in a while.

259
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,359
Guess I know what I'll be
yakking about in therapy today.

260
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,803
One day at a time, babe.

261
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,339
One day at a time.

262
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,100
One fucking day at a time.

263
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,644
You know what, if I hear that fucking
phrase one more fucking time...

264
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:33,147
She just fucking sits there in her
fucking leather chair and judges me...

265
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:37,185
like she's fucking God.
It's her job, Laurie. My God.

266
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:41,416
What am I supposed to say?
Boo-fucking-hoo for you.

267
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:44,117
See? You don't fucking care.

268
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:49,398
Right, I don't fucking care.
I don't understand, Laurie.

269
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:55,397
Oh, nice. Thanks for
leaving me some coffee, Dad.

270
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:09,210
I don't know, I just... I wake up
and I feel like I can't even breathe.

271
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,888


272
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,750
They seem to be
getting worse.

273
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,528
I'm... I'm concerned,

274
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:24,065
but, gosh, I can't say
that I'm surprised.

275
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,864
I mean, it's Halloween, and Halloween
is a big trigger point for you, isn't it?

276
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,235
Barbara,

277
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,674
I know Michael Myers is dead.

278
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,070
I shot him in the fucking head.

279
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,912
I know he's not gonna come back
just because of some stupid holiday.

280
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,486
Laurie, they never found his body.
So?

281
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:48,682
So it's very hard for you
to get closure on this.

282
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,329
I mean, he's objectively dead
but he's living in your mind,

283
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,158
and he's living in your
heart and your emotions.

284
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:58,563
So that's the reality that
we have to heal you from.

285
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,271
Which is why I say you're still
in recovery.

286
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:07,077
So, basically, I just have to wait
until my brain heals?

287
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:14,008
Well, let's try and help your brain
heal a little bit today, okay?

288
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,449
Okay.
Okay.

289
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,386
How's your relationship
with Annie going?

290
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,855
Annie?
Yeah.

291
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,297
Not good.

292
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,099
Hm.

293
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:35,430
I don't know, I feel kind of
shitty by saying this, but...

294
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:39,235
She's a constant reminder.

295
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:44,971
Every time I see her face,
and I see those scars,

296
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,413
I know that it's my fault.

297
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,680
And I get angry. And there's
something in my body that snaps.

298
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,826
And I get this zero to a hundred rage,
and I just wanna go up to her,

299
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:59,986
and I just wanna... Fuck, I don't know.
Finish the thought.

300
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:05,158
Finish that thought. It's important.
I'd rather not. You'll send me away.

301
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,200
I would never send you away. We're
here to keep you out of the hospital.

302
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:13,639
The last place you're gonna
heal is in a hospital.

303
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,615
What is that?

304
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,888
That? That's whatever you
think it is is what that is.

305
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:30,818
The theory is that this ambiguous
stimuli here will bring

306
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:34,965
your subconscious thoughts
into the light. Illuminate them.

307
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:36,798
So, what do you see?

308
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,003
White horse.

309
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:48,443
So, what does that tell you?
Am I crazy or sane?

310
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,243
It tells me you're a girl
who likes white horses.

311
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,653


312
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,991
The natives are getting restless.

313
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,068
You were supposed to
be here 45 minutes ago.

314
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,239


315
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,203
Hello. Yes, hello, darling.

316
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:20,935
No. How are you? Hello? Hello?

317
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:24,178
Damn. Hello?

318
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,178
Everybody has been completely
briefed on why we are here.

319
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,253
They know the drill so I don't foresee
any problems in that department.

320
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,788
Everything is kosher,
as my people say.

321
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,586
I know every one of these
journalists personally, they're cool.

322
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:39,228
Trust me, they are cool.

323
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,627
So I feel like this should be
really a positive experience,

324
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,233
you know, and be really
good for the book.

325
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:48,303
Whoa. Hi. Did you just mention
"journalists," "cool" and "positive"

326
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,736
all in the same sentence
without throwing up?

327
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,239
Yes, why?
Is that a problem?

328
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,469
It's just quite an oxymoron,
my dear.

329
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,511
Look, can you just
level with me?

330
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,513
Is there going to be
a problem today?

331
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,845
You are quite an odd one,
aren't you?

332
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,548
I mean, look at you.
Are you color-coordinated?

333
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,750
Pink clogs and this orange thing.
Are you a clam digger or something?

334
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,326
I don't mean that
in a lesbian sense.

335
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:15,226
I think you mean "carpet muncher."
I'm not judging. I'm not...

336
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,663
Hello.
Can we just not get personal?

337
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,268
Look at this. No!

338
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,495
Look,
it's the wrong photograph!

339
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:25,142
I mean, this is old Loomis.
This is new.

340
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:29,177
Yes, well, old Loomis increases
sales by 25 percent, okay? So just...

341
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,348
I'm not going in there
until you go get me

342
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,576
a cup of PG tips with a splash of
milk, and I want it sizzling hot.

343
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,812
PG what?

344
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,284
Tea?

345
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,219
We don't have time.

346
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,551
Fine. Fine,
I'll go find you some.

347
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,855
- Two percent.
- Two percent.

348
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:05,482
Wow, the princess of
punctuality is a little late.

349
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,584
Alert the authorities. Laurie
has been replaced by a pod.

350
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:11,346
Whoa, wait, I'm early.
I worked overtime last night.

351
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:15,720
Oh. See, you're too together. No,
you gotta loosen up a little, babe.

352
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,088
You know, bring some
anarchy to the party.

353
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,026
So you're saying I can start
showing up whenever I want?

354
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,961
Not on my dime, sister.

355
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,032
You can save the slacker shit

356
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,034
for those corporate bloodsuckers
who can afford it.

357
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,070
That's why we're going
down the toilet.

358
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,971
Since 1946, this country has
been under the military-industrial...

359
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,908
Fuck the man.
Right on, sister.

360
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,484
You're really interested.
I know, I know.

361
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:46,854
I give in. You win.
The old man caves again.

362
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,984
What's up with him?
I don't know.

363
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,990
Are you gonna come
and rock balls

364
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,095
with Harley and me at
the Phantom Jam or what?

365
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,992
Hells yeah.

366
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,635
But I'm not sure if I'm down with
the whole costume concept.

367
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:01,669
What? Okay, wait.
Think of it like this.

368
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,932
It's so lame that
it's totally cool again.

369
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,208
Well, I still
like my idea better.

370
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,212
What up, dick-lickers?

371
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,076
Could you please convince
Miss Too-Coolio-for-Schoolio

372
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,080
that our costume idea is totally rad?

373
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:18,244
Dude, suck it up, ho. We got a fucking
theme going on. Don't screw it up.

374
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,549
Plus we got you
that sick maid outfit

375
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,419
and dudes dig the domestic.

376
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,425
Come on, you guys, it's
borderline drama-class nerd.

377
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,325
Yeah. Own it.
All right. What do I have to do?

378
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,932
Stand on this chair and show the
old hippie dude my tits again?

379
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,260
- No.
- Oh, Meat!

380
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,959
Check out my lady lumps!
- No, no, no.

381
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,637
I'll wear it.
Put down your fucking shirt.

382
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,829
You give in too easy.

383
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,134
All right,
you guys ready for it?

384
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,368
For what?
Are you ready?

385
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,240
Kick out the jams, motherfucker!

386
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,882
<i>Michael, I'm sorry to tell you this,</i>

387
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,086
<i>but your mother has passed away.</i>

388
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,157
<i>She'll be back.</i>

389
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:05,358
<i>No, I'm afraid she won't be
coming to see you anymore.</i>

390
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:09,466
<i>I'll see her again,
but I won't see you.</i>

391
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,502
Ladies and
gentlemen, Dr. Samuel Loomis,

392
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:18,774
<i>author of The Devil Walks Among
Us, in stores October 31 st.</i>

393
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:22,414
Thank you all and welcome.

394
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,114
I think you can all see
quite clearly here

395
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,086
that Michael's psychotic perception

396
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:31,660
is in complete denial about his
own mother's suicide

397
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:35,230
Freud would certainly have a field day
with that little one, wouldn't he?

398
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:41,399
So it is the fate of all of us

399
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:46,100
to direct our first
sexual impulses towards our mothers

400
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:51,013
and our first murderess hatred
against our fathers.

401
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:55,649
Now, in Michael's case,
I became the surrogate father.

402
00:35:55,853 --> 00:36:01,052
The last father
in a long series of fathers.

403
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,859
Well, um, has anybody
got any questions at all?

404
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,689
Yes, sir. Yes. Please.

405
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:11,091
Um, you never really made it clear whether
you believe it was nurture or nature

406
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,497
that contributed
to Michael's condition.

407
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,631
I would like to answer it, in part,
by quoting

408
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,174
the great George Bernard Shaw,

409
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,438
with a little Loomis twist
at the end.

410
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:28,551
He says: "In the arts of life,
man invents nothing.

411
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:33,019
But in the arts of death,
he outdoes nature herself

412
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:37,194
and produces,
by chemistry and machinery,

413
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:42,025
all the slaughter of plague,
pestilence, famine"

414
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,463
and Michael Myers.

415
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,794


416
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,103
Well, sorry, but I like that little one.

417
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:51,937
That's my own
little twist.

418
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,301
Yes, ma'am?

419
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:57,743
Do you feel personally responsible for
the deaths of as many as 15 victims?

420
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,814
I have tremendous sympathy
for all the families involved.

421
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:09,721
And do I personally feel
responsible? Ma'am, no, I do not.

422
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,952
And I've said that many times.

423
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,723
It's just awful and, um,

424
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:17,366
I was very nearly a victim myself.

425
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:21,698
I'm not a psychic Sherlock Holmes
playing Superman.

426
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:25,067
Since the authorities haven't
been able to produce a body,

427
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,710
do you think Michael
is alive or dead?

428
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,178
<i>Will he kill again?</i>

429
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:31,776
Here we go again.

430
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:37,553
Look, let me make things
nice and sparkling clear.

431
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,916
Michael Myers is fucking dead!

432
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,388
Now, do you brain-dead
gossip mongers

433
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:46,689
want me to spell it out for you?
D-E-A-D!

434
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,237
Michael.

435
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,442
Halloween is coming.

436
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,384
You have to get ready.

437
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,754
We are counting on you
to bring us home this year.

438
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,289
I won't let you down.

439
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,159
I know you won't, baby.

440
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,627
I love you, Mama.

441
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,665
I love you too, Michael.

442
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,768
It's that same
guy who's been coming.

443
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:02,961
You seen him before?

444
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,232
Yeah, it's the same filthy bum.

445
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,070
Stealing our shit.
I'd recognize him anywhere, Daddy.

446
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,336
Motherfucker.

447
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:12,708
Can't have drifters just coming in
here and taking whatever they want.

448
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,549
What y'all gonna do?

449
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,380
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

450
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,085
Shut up, Ivan.
We see him.

451
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:26,418
Let's do it.

452
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,071
You're just gonna scare him.

453
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:41,574
Daddy, what the fuck?
Safety.

454
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:47,809
Hey, you stupid, slimy dick.

455
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:52,284
I told you if you came on this land
again, I'd beat the fuck out of you.

456
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:55,383
What the fuck you think
you're doing here?

457
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,289
As big as he is dumb, man.

458
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:02,091
Look at that. He's about
7-foot of fuck-tard.

459
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,834
I'm talking to you, shit-heel.

460
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,060
You stupid fuck!

461
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,203
I'm talking to you!

462
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,938
What's wrong with
this son of a bitch?

463
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,635
Give him a taste of that here.

464
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,249
All right.

465
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,316
Hey! No! You'll fucking kill him.

466
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,147
Wanna go to jail for
killing that fucking turd?

467
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,947
One more shot. Shut up!

468
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,924
Woo-hoo-hoo.

469
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,150
Chris, knock it off.

470
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:33,121
- Big man.
- Oh, man.

471
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,764
Come on, Daddy.
Don't you come back, son of a bitch.

472
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,196
Man, that was a professional
ass-whupping there.

473
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,894
Oh, I'm jacked.

474
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,094
Whoo!

475
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,302
You okay?
Shut up, Ivan!

476
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,945
I'm so sorry. What are we gonna
do, just fucking leave him out here?

477
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,443
Get in the truck.

478
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,138
Come on now. Chop-chop.

479
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,180
Get in the truck.
I'm so sorry.

480
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,746
I am so sorry.

481
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,247
Shut up, Ivan.

482
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:11,833
- Whoo.
- Seriously.

483
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,675
Jump up.
You didn't need to

484
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,504
fucking beat him to a pulp.

485
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,843
- I told the guy.
- Fuck that.

486
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:30,275
Oh, my God!

487
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,521
Fuck!

488
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:37,885
No, Daddy!

489
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:10,816
What are you doing?
I said I was fucking sorry!

490
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,146
Pizza.

491
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:41,381
Dude, you didn't get whole wheat.
I forgot.

492
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:44,954
Anybody hungry?

493
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:48,188
Starving like Marvin.
- Starving like Marvin.

494
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,266
Has anybody at this table
ever wondered

495
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:52,696
who Marvin is?

496
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,770
I mean, the original Marvin
who was starving Marvin?

497
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:58,635
What?
Was it...? Was it Lee Marvin?

498
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,776
Who's Lee Marvin?

499
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,439
"Who's Lee Marvin?"

500
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,904
Did I stutter?

501
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:08,952
<i>Paint Your Wagon.
The Professionals. Lee Marvin.</i>

502
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,882
<i>Cat Ballou?</i>

503
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,556
<i>Cat Ballou.
He was great in Cat Ballou.</i>

504
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:18,558
I can't believe you guys haven't seen
it. He was, like, playing this drunk,

505
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:21,463
but he's, like, the
greatest gun in the West.

506
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,064
At one point he's, like,

507
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,360
talking about being a gunslinger.

508
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,163
Bam. And he misses the barn.

509
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,902
He misses the barn completely.

510
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:37,847
I wanna thank the both of you for
making me feel as old as Methuselah.

511
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:41,506
All I know is I hope that dead, rotting
flesh didn't bump on my pineapple.

512
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,812
A little dead, rotting flesh
never hurt anybody.

513
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,751
Oh, God. Do we have to do this
every fucking time we eat together?

514
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,187
We need to get you off
the animal products, Mr. B.

515
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,726
Not gonna happen.
Man was meant to eat meat.

516
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,922
We, all of us, have a
little bit of caveman in us.

517
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:04,596
God.

518
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,443
How is it possible
that every father

519
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,085
perfects the art of humiliating
their offspring?

520
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:17,886
What? It's cute.

521
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,233
What?
Come on, Annie.

522
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,306
I'll go. I always go.

523
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,627
Hang on.

524
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,690
God.

525
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,397
Here.
Thanks.

526
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,035
Sorry I was such
a bitch earlier.

527
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,476
I get it.

528
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,849
Okay.

529
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,847
Where have you been?
I've been waiting.

530
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,117
You know
I can't come here anymore.

531
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,618
My time here is over.

532
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:01,586
You're here now.
Michael,

533
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,726
you know
I'm not really here.

534
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,889
I wanna show you something.

535
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,158
All right.

536
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,285
I found her.

537
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,546
I found Boo.

538
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,267
My baby.

539
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,865
Can we be a family again?

540
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Not yet, Michael.
Not yet.

541
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,344
Oh, fuck.

542
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,892
Come here, buddy.

543
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,650
So, Dr. Loomis, tell me.

544
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,447
How long do you plan on
staying in town?

545
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,248
Please. Sam.

546
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,790
Thank you. Well, I could
stay a few extra days.

547
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,494
It depends on if there's something
or someone that motivated me.

548
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,687
Excuse me, Dr. Loomis...

549
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,127
We're in... I'm in the
middle of something.

550
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:51,733
Could I speak to you
for a second? Please?

551
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,199
What?
Please?

552
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:58,033
Excuse me, my dear.
I won't be one second.

553
00:47:58,742 --> 00:47:59,731
What?

554
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:02,070
Okay, I am all for
selling books. All right?

555
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:05,373
God knows I've done some
things that I'm not proud of,

556
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:09,814
but this is disgusting.
I did not agree to this backdrop.

557
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,011
I mean, what's next?
Heading over to the cemetery

558
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,951
and dancing on
the victims' graves?

559
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:17,058
Look, I don't think you
quite understand

560
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:20,697
what I'm trying to accomplish here.
Well, fair enough. I don't.

561
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,298
Please, explain it to me.
I would really like to understand.

562
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,402
I'm selling the sizzle,
not the steak.

563
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:29,295
The sizzle?
Yes.

564
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:33,173
The sizzle. It's bad taste
is what it is.

565
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,274
It's just gonna add fuel
to the lynch mob fire.

566
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,606
Bad taste? Bad taste?

567
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,976
My God, it's business, woman! Business.

568
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:44,551
Besides, bad taste is the petrol
that drives the American dream.

569
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:46,782
Well, I think it's a mistake.

570
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,548
Oh, yeah, you do, do you?
Yes.

571
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,922
Well, when I want your opinion,
I'll beat it out of you.

572
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:58,167
Here. Now, take that and go sit in
the car. Go on. Get your ass in there.

573
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,460
Okay. Hi, where do you want me?

574
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

575
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,055
<i>Die, you fucking bitch!</i>

576
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,887
<i>You fucking bitch!
I'm gonna fucking kill you.</i>

577
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,991
<i>I'm gonna fuck you...
Rip your fucking throat.</i>

578
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,826
Fucking die, you fucking bitch!

579
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,263
<i>You fucking cunt!</i>

580
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,027
<i>Fucking bitch!</i>

581
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,465
Please, Laurie, please!

582
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:47,975
You fucking...
Die, you fucking bitch!

583
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:54,916
Laurie! Laurie, Laurie, Laurie!

584
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,154
- You guys like Frankenstein?
- Yes.

585
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,122
Who likes popcorn?

586
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:40,558
<i>So I was going through the park,</i>

587
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:44,666
and there was this
really crazy Frankenstein.

588
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,460
<i>And he was, like, yelling at the kids.</i>

589
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:50,765
And he was yelling at them,
like, perverted things and stuff.

590
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:54,842
And I really thought it was funny
and I stopped and watched.

591
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:59,180
<i>And then I saw this, like, farm.</i>

592
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,748
Laurie?
And this lady let me hold the pig.

593
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,715
What are you
feeling right now, Laurie?

594
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,184
The pig really liked me
and she said that the pig

595
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,357
Laurie?
Liked me. I wanted to take it home.

596
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,458
Sit down, Laurie.

597
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,187
Come on, Laurie.

598
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,797
Stay centered.
What's going on?

599
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:21,634
I had this really, really,
really crazy attack.

600
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,274
And not while I was asleep,
while I was awake.

601
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,967
Look, I just need you to
prescribe me something, please.

602
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:32,512
Laurie, according to my notes, you
should have a lot of medication.

603
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,741
I don't. I'm out.

604
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:38,543
Look, I need you to get your magic
pen and your magic piece of paper,

605
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,485
and I need you to write me up
a prescription, please.

606
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:45,127
Laurie, that's not the answer. Are
you doing your breathing exercises?

607
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,592
Breathing exercises?
Yes, it helps.

608
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:50,357
Breathing exercises aren't gonna cut it.
They help, Laurie.

609
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,967
And I can't deal with this!
Oh, honey.

610
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,333
I'm not strong enough and
I'm tired of pretending that I am.

611
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,008
Look, Laurie, listen to me.
Stay with me.

612
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,007
You are so much stronger
than you think you are. You are.

613
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:07,013
Now, go on, sit down. Sit down.
You better fucking let me go

614
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:09,777
and give me
some fucking prescriptions!

615
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:12,648
I'm gonna give you some
Haldol to tide you over.

616
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,915
Haldol?
Yes, Haldol.

617
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:17,992
It'll take some of these thoughts away.
I don't want Haldol.

618
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:22,723
I want my prescription!
I'm so sorry you're going through this.

619
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:24,161
Fuck, you know what?

620
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,892
Fuck you and fuck this!

621
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:29,435
I'm tired of your:
"How are you, Laurie?

622
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,869
I'm so concerned
at 100 bucks an hour."

623
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:35,805
You know what? I would be fucking
concerned at 100 bucks an hour.

624
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:38,037
I'm really concerned right now.
Bullshit.

625
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:41,809
No, it's not bullshit.
You're more fucked up than I am,

626
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:43,076
you crazy bitch!

627
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:59,896
<i>For most of us, Michael
Myers is a mysterious legend of evil.</i>

628
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:01,502
<i>But for Dr. Samuel Loomis,</i>

629
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,935
<i>the bogeyman is all too real.</i>

630
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,371
<i>There have been wild rumors circulating
as to the content of your new book.</i>

631
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,067
<i>What can you tell me?
Well,</i>

632
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:11,213
<i>after my last encounter
with Michael,</i>

633
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,882
<i>some startling facts
came to light,</i>

634
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:16,675
<i>and I just thought that
the public really ought to know.</i>

635
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:18,615
<i>Such as?</i>

636
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:20,613
<i>Read the book, as they say.</i>

637
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:24,089
<i>But weren't you horrified when the news
broke that Michael's body went missing?</i>

638
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,262
<i>No, not really.</i>

639
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:30,225
<i>How you can lose a body, you
know, transporting it from A to B.</i>

640
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,603
<i>You better ask the sheriff's
department that one.</i>

641
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:35,498
<i>Well, do you think
that the body will reappear?</i>

642
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,296
<i>Yes, probably. You know,
somewhere it'll reappear,</i>

643
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:42,308
<i>along with the Elephant Man's
bones at some sideshow.</i>

644
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,878
<i>But as my old Aunt Miri
used to say:</i>

645
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:48,107
<i>"Freaks will always
find their way home."</i>

646
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,867
What's up with the booze?

647
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,731
Oh, yeah.
Meet my new best friend.

648
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:13,406
Oh, is this how
your new work friends roll?

649
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,509
Maybe. Jealous?

650
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:20,406
Whatever.
You know what Annie?

651
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,414
I don't need your shit.

652
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:27,322
You don't need
my shit?

653
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:31,426
You don't need my shit?
I put up with your shit, 24-7.

654
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:35,159
You better back the fuck off!

655
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:37,663
Or what, huh?
The fuck are you gonna do?

656
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:41,564
You know what, you act like you're the
only one whose life got fucking trashed.

657
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:45,002
I'm so not buying
the new Laurie act.

658
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,369
I'm not putting up
with your moaning shit.

659
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:52,480
Get the fuck out of my room!
Get the fuck out of my room!

660
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,310
I'm not impressed.

661
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:00,856
Fuck!

662
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,599
"Hey, Howard.

663
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:17,671
Can't afford the new tits.
Can you loan me some bones?"

664
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:20,765
Fucking whore.

00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:23,138
Hey! Hey, Misty, come here.

666
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,314
Come on, it's on.
Come on, it's finally on.

667
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,712
I'm on TV. You're missing it. Move
your ass. Come here. Look at this!

668
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:30,215
Oh, my God, baby.

669
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,217
Look at that. I'm incredible.

your face at the Rabbit In Red Lounge</i>

girls dance because they are fantastic.</i>

Hey, Howard,
where are those drinks?

673
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:44,959
Hey, boss. That's
right, they love you, man.

674
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:48,035
That's why the whole town loves you.
- Yeah, they love me.

675
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,263
They love me like cancer,
that's how much they love me.

676
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:52,202
You look like
that big guy.

677
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,308
The shit falls on his head.

What are you talking about?

681
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,018
Yeah. Green makes you look sexy, baby.

682
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,151
Green. That suits you, man.

683
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:12,226
It really suits you. It's like
the color of money. Ka-ching.

684
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:14,589
Dumb ass.
Ha-ha-ha.

685
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:16,732
Hey, Howard, let
me ask you a question.

686
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,059
I got a riddle for you.

687
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,829
What does a stripper do with her
asshole before she dances.

688
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,297
I don't know.

689
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:28,475
She gives him 10 bucks and she
tells him to take out the trash!

690
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,275
That's a good one.
Here, Howard. Take out the trash.

691
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,111
Take out the trash,
Howard.

692
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:37,877
He's good at
taking out the trash.

693
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:39,748
I'm funny.

694
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,390
Yeah, I'm the big joke.

695
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,619
Hey, I'm on TV. Quiet.
Shut up. Shut up.

696
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:48,593
Enjoy the fucking herpes, old man.

697
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,892
- I got an aura.
- You got an aura, baby.

698
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:53,591
You have an aura.
You got two auras.

699
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:56,067
- You're so bad.
- Really?

700
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:58,672
- Auras are popping out.
- Ha! Let me see those auras.

701
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,743
Two-faced bitch.

702
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:15,851
Fucking Hoss. I'm fucking
Hop Sing doing all the chores.

703
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:17,651
You bitch.

704
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:22,087
"Yeah, Howard.

705
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:26,701
Can I have some money for
my dad's blood transfusion?"

706
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:30,437
What the fuck you doing, man,

707
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,074
sneaking around back here?

708
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:36,443
Hey.

709
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:40,215
The boss don't like you
bums hanging out back here,

710
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,907
rooting around
through the Dumpsters.

711
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,512
So get a move on.

712
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,592
Look, man.

713
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,425
Don't give me no reason.

714
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,634
I already sent some
sorry fucking jag-off

715
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:03,999
to the emergency room
tonight.

716
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,367
So

717
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:09,602
I suggest you
take the easy road out

718
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,080
and hit the bricks, Dorothy.

719
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,351
Heh, fu...

720
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,956
Trust me,

721
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:29,154
you filthy, dirty hippie,

722
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,865
you don't wanna be doing that.

723
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:35,127
Copy that, downtown?

724
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:40,498
Fuck.

725
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

726
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
