Aagh!

3
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:56,962
Help me!

4
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:05,630
Can you play at peek-a-boo?

5
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:08,588
I can play at peek-a-boo!

6
00:01:08,713 --> 00:01:11,630

Peek-a-peek-a-peek-a-peek-a-boo!

00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:21,130
<i>Well done. That's very good. Now, ssh!</i>

10
00:01:26,338 --> 00:01:27,797
Still.

11
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,588
And everyone up.

12
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:36,838
And that's the end of the week.
Well done.

13
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:05,714
- Hey.
- Hey.

14
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:07,381
Sorry.

15
00:02:20,214 --> 00:02:24,049
Kat's boyfriend is taking her to Paris
for the weekend

16
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:27,090
and mine is taking me
to a disused quarry!

17
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:29,715
It's a flooded quarry. It's lovely.

18
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,424
It's the last chance to see it
before the developers build over it.

- You're such a boy!</i>

21
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:44,799
<i>And I can mate it up to my mobile phone.
Pretty sexy, huh?</i>

22
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:46,924
Grrr!

23
00:02:49,257 --> 00:02:51,840
<i>Stop it, I'm driving.</i>

24
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,715
What's that?

25
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,215
<i>The guy's wife had a bad back.
Kinky, huh?</i>

26
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,174
<i>Actually, it's quite nice.</i>

27
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:05,591

- Have you cycled all the way here?
- And no Kylie!

I'm not so sure about the top, though.</i>

00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:24,603
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Clear off!

97
00:11:24,728 --> 00:11:28,812
- What the fuck's all this shit?
- Fucking little prick.

98
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:32,145
<i>Hey, that's the little boy we saw.</i>

99
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,145
Since when did you support England?

100
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,395
Little hoods.

<i>Oh, Steve...</i>

103

It's just boys being boys.

104
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:50,478
As long as they leave us alone.

105
00:11:50,603 --> 00:11:52,978
<i>Run for it, run!</i>

106
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:56,103
<i>- Get the fuck out of here!
- Go on, have him.</i>

107
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jesus!

108
00:12:21,146 --> 00:12:22,896
<i>Bonnie, come!</i>

109
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:25,396
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

110
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:28,146
<i>Good girl, good girl, good girl.</i>

111
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:34,979
Come on then.

112
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:36,646
Lovely.

113
00:12:39,314 --> 00:12:42,939
Fancy a dip before it craps in the water?

114
00:12:43,064 --> 00:12:46,480
<i>No, you go. I'll keep an eye on the stuff.</i>

115
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:48,647
Probably not a bad idea.

116
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:50,647
Good girl.

117
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,648
<i>Oh, man!</i>

118
00:13:22,731 --> 00:13:24,815
<i>Come on, Bonnie! Bonnie!</i>

119
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,065
<i>Bonnie, come here, girl!
Come here! Come here!</i>

120
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,273
<i>Good girl, Bonnie.</i>

121
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:40,606
Ow!

122
00:13:48,815 --> 00:13:52,731
<i>Hey, guys. Can you do us a favour
and turn the music down?</i>

123
00:13:52,856 --> 00:13:56,106

- Turn your sounds down.</i>

124
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:59,065
<i>Can't hear you, mate.</i>

125
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:07,024
- What are you doing?
- And watch your dog.

126
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:09,649
- He's scaring my girlfriend.
- She.

127
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:12,857
- Hmm?
- Bitch. She's a bitch.

128
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:18,441
Don't be dicks. This is a big beach.
There's room for all of us.

129
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,649
Who are you calling a dick?

130
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:23,399
And what are you looking at? My tits?

131
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,191
Fucking jog on! Prick.

132
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:31,149
Dickhead.

133
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,817
<i>Hey, what a prick!</i>

134
00:14:41,942 --> 00:14:43,733
Mug!

135
00:14:58,108 --> 00:14:59,942
Oh!

136
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,650
Why don't we just find another spot?

137
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:06,025
I won't be bullied by a bunch
of 12-year-olds.

138
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,817
- And let it ruin our afternoon?
- We were here first.

139
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:15,900
<i>Well, this is relaxing</i>

140
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,568
- What are you doing?
- Fuck off!

141
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:23,776
Why? Why?

142
00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:31,151
<i>Oh, mate, I love bird-watching.</i>

143
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:35,568
<i>- What's with you, you tit?
- You're the tit!</i>

144
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:41,943
What are you looking at her for?

145
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:44,901
<i>I'm not looking at her face,
just her tits.</i>

146
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:47,609
She's an ugly bint.

147
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,277
Booya-booya-booya!

148
00:16:22,235 --> 00:16:24,777
<i>Yeah, do you want my autograph?</i>

149
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:34,819
Happy now? Hmm?

150
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:36,527
Hmm.

151
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:47,820
<i>Hey, Jenny!</i>

152
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,486
Nearly!

153
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:34,529
Fancy another brewski?

154
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,737
<i>Yeah, why not?</i>

155
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:43,362
<i>Steve, what's that?</i>

156
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:48,362
It's nothing.

157
00:17:54,696 --> 00:17:57,279
There's not much to do after dark.

158
00:17:57,404 --> 00:17:58,862
Nope.

159
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:04,029
Wanna check out
our exclusive New England home?

160
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:06,738
- Hmm?
- Sure.

161
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:11,030
- Do you like it?
- I think it's beautiful.

162
00:18:24,613 --> 00:18:26,947
- Stephen Taylor...
- Hmm?

163
00:18:30,988 --> 00:18:33,072
What's that noise?

164
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,863
It's just the wind.

165
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:42,905
<i>No, that's not the wind.</i>

166
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:47,989
Could be a fox.

167
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:51,156
Or a donkey.

168
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:55,406
<i>No, listen. Ssh!</i>

169
00:18:56,573 --> 00:18:58,739
You're just imagining it.

170
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:07,281
<i>- I'll go take a look.
- No, don't go... Go.</i>

171
00:19:26,323 --> 00:19:27,990
Steve?

172
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:32,240
Hello?

173
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:34,449
Steve?

174
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,657
Hello?

175
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:45,449
Steve!

176
00:19:51,282 --> 00:19:53,365
Ugh!

177
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:56,282
Steve?

178
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:04,365
<i>Steve, stop messing around!</i>

179
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Steve!
- Ooh ah ha ha ha!

180
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:23,866
- That was horrible.
- I'm sorry.

181
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:26,158
- Get off!
- I'm really sorry.

182
00:20:26,283 --> 00:20:29,491
- Ow! You're freezing!
- Then warm me up.

183
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:33,366
<i>You're a big, crude, pikey oaf!</i>

184
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:35,866
I love you. Love you.

185
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,784
Eugh!

186
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:14,201
I am absolutely starving.

187
00:21:14,326 --> 00:21:17,451
- I could eat a horse.
- So move to France.

188
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,909
Fuck!

189
00:21:23,117 --> 00:21:24,659
Shit!

190
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,784
- What's happened?
- Little fuckers!

191
00:21:48,702 --> 00:21:52,243
<i>- How's your tyre, mate?
- Fucking git!</i>

192
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:54,452
Little fuckers!

193
00:21:55,743 --> 00:21:58,160
<i>No, wait, Steve!</i>

194
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:03,368
- Watch it!
- Shit!

195
00:22:03,493 --> 00:22:07,660
<i>You should've got a smaller body,
fucking dollar boy!</i>

196
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:10,827
- Breakfast?
- Fuck!

197
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:16,536
<i>Right, what would you like?</i>

198
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:19,911
The full English
with white toast and coffee.

199
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:22,911
- And for you?
- I'll get the same.

200
00:22:23,036 --> 00:22:27,869
<i>Hey, you wouldn't have seen a bunch
of kids tooling around on BMXs?</i>

201
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:31,119
Certainly have. Been terrorising you?

202
00:22:31,244 --> 00:22:35,036
<i>- Well, hassling us.
- Little terrors.</i>

203
00:22:36,828 --> 00:22:40,036
<i>I wouldn't worry too much,
a big boy like you.</i>

204
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:44,828
They punctured my back tyre.
I thought parents might want to know.

205
00:22:44,953 --> 00:22:47,828
Not my kids.

206
00:22:47,953 --> 00:22:52,287
<i>- No, I didn't mean they were your kids.
- Not mine.</i>

207
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,579
Never mind.

208
00:22:56,704 --> 00:22:58,787
I don't want any trouble.

209
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,704
Making friends?

210
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,745
I think she likes me.

211
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:20,662
What the?

212
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:23,787
<i>No, Steve, it's not worth it.</i>

213
00:23:23,912 --> 00:23:28,620
<i>If everyone said that, where would we be?
I'll be back in a minute.</i>

214
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:53,830
Hello?

215
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,163
Anyone home?

216
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:04,663
Hello?

217
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

218
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:29,039
<i>- Come on, you're blocking my drive!
- OK.</i>

219
00:24:29,164 --> 00:24:31,247
- Come on!
- All right!

220
00:24:32,414 --> 00:24:33,456
Sorry!

221
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:35,664
Stupid bitch!

222
00:25:15,623 --> 00:25:16,665
Shit!

223
00:25:20,123 --> 00:25:23,623
Brett! Is that you?
Get down here now!

224
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:25,957
<i>Can't run away, little bunny.</i>

225
00:25:26,082 --> 00:25:30,290
<i>Yeah, that's right,
you can't because you're in a box.</i>

226
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:33,915
<i>Brett!
Brett, don't make me come up there!</i>

227
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:38,791
Shit!

228
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,833
Brett!

229
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:57,291
The hutch should be destroyed. Burn it.

230
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:59,166
Brett!

231
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,374
Let's go!

232
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,999
I can feel that schoolteacher look.

233
00:26:08,124 --> 00:26:12,166
<i>Yeah, you're lucky.
You could have broken something.</i>

234
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:16,458
<i>- Let's just enjoy the weekend.
- Yeah, I'd like that.</i>

235
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,542
Yes?

236
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:38,209
<i>- You were going to say something?
- No, not a word.</i>

237
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:40,667
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

238
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:44,875
<i>- I thought you were looking at my foot.
- No, wait. No, no!</i>

239
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,292
<i>- You're going in!
- Steve, no!</i>

240
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,834
No!

241
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,876
<i>- Oh, it's fucking freezing.
- Language!</i>

242
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:28,418
<i>All right, lazy bones?</i>

243
00:27:40,502 --> 00:27:44,544
It's amazing the stuff you find
at the bottom of the lake.

244
00:27:45,502 --> 00:27:47,752
<i>Steve, where's the beach bag?</i>

245
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,919
It was right here.

246
00:27:54,002 --> 00:27:57,419
I don't believe it.
It's got the car keys in it.

247
00:28:01,336 --> 00:28:03,794
<i>Please, God, don't tell me...</i>

248
00:28:04,627 --> 00:28:06,419
Fuck!

249
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:11,169
Fuck! Fuck!

250
00:28:56,587 --> 00:28:58,045
Tossers!

251
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,588
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

252
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:47,380
<i>Jenny, come on.</i>

253
00:30:08,672 --> 00:30:11,880
- Come on.
- No... Let's just leave it.

254
00:30:12,005 --> 00:30:14,089
They've got our car.

255
00:30:17,047 --> 00:30:19,672
<i>Go on, go on. Go on!</i>

256
00:30:19,797 --> 00:30:22,464
Fucking shitting itself! Fuck off!

257
00:30:27,673 --> 00:30:28,923
Brett!

258
00:30:37,715 --> 00:30:41,090
Listen... I don't care
what you're up to here.

259
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:44,715
<i>- I just want my car back.
- It's not us, mate.</i>

260
00:30:50,131 --> 00:30:52,215
<i>Car keys, phone, wallet.</i>

261
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,798
<i>- Not us, mate.
- Steve, come on. Let's leave it.</i>

262
00:30:56,631 --> 00:31:00,131
<i>- You're wearing my shades.
- They're mine, mate.</i>

263
00:31:00,256 --> 00:31:02,715
Your Ray-Ban Aviators?

264
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,924
<i>Fakes, mate.</i>

265
00:31:07,216 --> 00:31:09,716
<i>Yeah, Steve, come on.</i>

266
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:14,299
Listen... You've had your fun.

267
00:31:15,466 --> 00:31:19,091
Let's just call it quits.
Tell me where the car is.

268
00:31:20,424 --> 00:31:22,549
Keep that animal back.

269
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:26,049
<i>- Where's my fucking car?
- I've got no idea, mate.</i>

270
00:31:26,174 --> 00:31:28,716
- Watch that fucking dog!
- Watch yours!

271
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:31,132
What did you say?

272
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,882
That's my phone.

273
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:39,132
- Steve...
- Got the same ringtone as me?

274
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,007
Steve!

275
00:31:44,883 --> 00:31:47,592
Hit him! He's got a fucking knife!

276
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:01,675
Bonnie...

277
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:06,967
Bonnie! Bonnie!

278
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:15,175
You stuck my dog.

279
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,758
It was an accident. Give me the car keys.
I'll drive her to the vet.

280
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:22,508
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

281
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:25,843
Fuck off!

282
00:32:39,384 --> 00:32:41,676
She's... She's fucking dying.

283
00:32:43,343 --> 00:32:45,676
I'm sorry.

284
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:48,426
- She's fucking dying!
- Brett...

285
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:51,009
- Brett...
- Fuck off!

286
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:55,926
<i>Bonnie, don't die on me. Not you. Bonnie!</i>

287
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:57,384
Steve...

288
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:00,134
I've got the car keys. Let's just go.

289
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:03,093
<i>- Come on!
- Don't die on me, Bonnie!</i>

290
00:33:03,218 --> 00:33:05,843
<i>Come on, Steve!</i>

291
00:33:14,177 --> 00:33:15,844
Bonnie!

292
00:33:22,344 --> 00:33:24,802
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

293
00:33:26,177 --> 00:33:28,052
Get 'em!

294
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:32,719
Fuck!

295
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,385
<i>Steve, quick!</i>

296
00:33:50,345 --> 00:33:51,553
Right!

297
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,470
Shit!

298
00:33:56,261 --> 00:33:57,803
Go back!

299
00:34:02,803 --> 00:34:03,845
Shit!

300
00:34:11,386 --> 00:34:13,553
- Get on to it!
- Jesus Christ!

301
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:15,720
Come on!

302
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,970
<i>Quick, go back!</i>

303
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:20,095
Get out the fucking car!

304
00:34:21,345 --> 00:34:23,595
<i>- Oh, my God, oh, my God!
- Fuck!</i>

305
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,803
Get out the fucking car!

306
00:34:25,928 --> 00:34:28,346
Get out the fucking car!

307
00:34:30,554 --> 00:34:32,221
Fucking prick!

308
00:34:32,346 --> 00:34:34,387
<i>Oh, my God! Shit!</i>

309
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,679
- You fucking bitch!
- Steve!

310
00:34:42,262 --> 00:34:44,554
<i>I can't see, I can't fucking see.</i>

311
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:48,262
I can't see where we're fucking going!
Jesus Christ!

312
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,471
Shit!

313
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,804
Aargh! Oh!

314
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:03,804
Are you all right? Wait.

315
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:06,387
Ohhh!

316
00:35:06,512 --> 00:35:09,722
- I can't get...
- I'm stuck! I'm fucking stuck!

317
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:11,513
- Wait.
- Jesus!

318
00:35:11,638 --> 00:35:15,013
- I can't get it.
- OK... Listen to me.

319
00:35:15,138 --> 00:35:18,222
<i>- Oh, my God, they're coming!
- Listen to me!</i>

320
00:35:18,347 --> 00:35:21,347
Listen. Go. Find a road. Take this.

321
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,263
- No...
- Go get help! Go!

322
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:41,472
Fucking kill 'em!

323
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,013
<i>This way, this way, come on!</i>

324
00:35:51,431 --> 00:35:54,098
<i>Brett, it's over here!</i>

325
00:35:54,223 --> 00:35:55,598
Fuck!

326
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:58,306
Come over here. I've got the car!

327
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:05,806
Ugh!

328
00:38:04,642 --> 00:38:06,809
<i>Brett, this is fucked up!</i>

329
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:13,059
It's ten fucking miles into town
in the dark. She's not fucking Lassie!

330
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:18,017
Are you watching the road?

331
00:38:18,142 --> 00:38:20,601
No one goes home. You get here now!

332
00:38:20,726 --> 00:38:25,434
<i>Please, let me go. I won't say anything.
Please, let me go.</i>

333
00:38:26,642 --> 00:38:30,309
<i>Listen, Brett,
people know that we're here.</i>

334
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:33,059
They're going to call the police.

335
00:38:33,184 --> 00:38:38,143
<i>If you let me go, I swear on my life,
I won't tell anyone.</i>

336
00:38:38,268 --> 00:38:43,018
<i>Look, guys, please. We can stop this.
Nobody's died yet.</i>

337
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:45,227
My fucking dog died though!

338
00:38:45,352 --> 00:38:47,560
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

339
00:38:47,685 --> 00:38:52,310
There's going to be another accident
when I find that bitch of yours!

340
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:57,685
"No one's died. "
Wait and see what happens to her

341
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,310
when I fucking see her!

342
00:39:00,435 --> 00:39:04,102
Get the fuck off me! Fucking little prick!

343
00:39:04,227 --> 00:39:06,685
<i>Let's not be head-loose, right?</i>

344
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,685
- Who are you calling head-loose?
- Let's not be rash.

345
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,436
<i>First phone he sees, 999-
who's fucking head-loose?</i>

346
00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:22,144
<i>No, this is rash shit, man.
I never touched him.</i>

347
00:39:26,144 --> 00:39:29,144
<i>- What, you didn't touch him?
- No, mate.</i>

348
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,186
You fucking touch him now then!

349
00:39:39,853 --> 00:39:41,811
Him or me.

350
00:39:45,603 --> 00:39:49,769
<i>You wanna front, you wanna act
like the fucking big man?</i>

351
00:39:49,894 --> 00:39:52,103
You'll step up now.

352
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:03,729
All right.

353
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,687
Jesus...

354
00:40:07,812 --> 00:40:10,395
<i>Paige, get this!</i>

355
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:16,312
<i>- Don't fucking record it, man.
- Huh?</i>

356
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,687
<i>No, wait.</i>

357
00:40:20,812 --> 00:40:22,895
Fucking wait!

358
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:33,770
- Go on then.
- Fuck you!

359
00:40:42,813 --> 00:40:46,230
No. That's not even a proper cut. Deeper.

360
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,730
Deeper!

361
00:40:49,855 --> 00:40:52,313
Aaaargh!

362
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:54,730
Aaagh! Fuck!

363
00:41:01,688 --> 00:41:05,521
<i>All right, now everyone'll have a dig.
Marky Mark?</i>

364
00:41:16,938 --> 00:41:18,397
Jesus!

365
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:21,731
<i>- Oh, man, I can't fucking see this!
- Jesus!</i>

366
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:25,064
Ugh!

367
00:41:25,189 --> 00:41:27,189
<i>- Fuck's sake.
- Go on, Mark.</i>

368
00:41:28,314 --> 00:41:32,022
<i>- Aaaagh!
- Jesus Christ, fucking bollocks.</i>

369
00:41:37,939 --> 00:41:40,064
Ricky Dicky...

370
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:58,773
Go on.

371
00:42:02,982 --> 00:42:05,023
Shit! My shoe!

372
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,482
<i>These are fucking Gold Tops, man.
Brand-new.</i>

373
00:42:09,607 --> 00:42:11,857
You little fuckwit.

374
00:42:11,982 --> 00:42:14,857
<i>Cooper! Bang on, mate, you're up!</i>

375
00:42:14,982 --> 00:42:16,107
What?

376
00:42:16,232 --> 00:42:18,315
<i>Come on, mate.</i>

377
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:21,732
Knife.

378
00:42:21,857 --> 00:42:23,940
<i>Paige, keep that phone up.</i>

379
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,648
<i>Right, Coops, everyone has a dig.</i>

380
00:42:36,315 --> 00:42:39,607
<i>Go on then, Cooper.
Let's see your bottle.</i>

381
00:42:54,774 --> 00:42:56,899
<i>Come on, come on. Please.</i>

382
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:07,149
<i>Brett, I can't.</i>

383
00:43:07,274 --> 00:43:11,566
<i>For fuck's sake, listen!
We're all in this together. Go on.</i>

384
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:14,024
- He's scared.
- I'm not scared.

385
00:43:14,149 --> 00:43:19,233
Listen. He's heard all of our fucking
names. Either do it or he's gonna spill.

386
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:21,400
Go on...

387
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:31,359
Do it! Cut his fucking tongue out!

388
00:43:32,775 --> 00:43:37,025
- Fucking hell! That's bloody.
- That's lethal.

389
00:43:42,067 --> 00:43:45,817
- Here you are.
- I can't believe you did that.

390
00:43:45,942 --> 00:43:48,442
Look - it's Tony Montana!

391
00:43:53,567 --> 00:43:56,775
All right. Now we've got to finish this.

392
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:11,026
<i>Please, please...</i>

393
00:44:12,276 --> 00:44:14,568
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

394
00:44:17,901 --> 00:44:21,193
Please...

395
00:44:22,651 --> 00:44:25,818
What's up?

396
00:44:28,818 --> 00:44:32,193
Bluetooth. She's fucking here.

397
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:35,110
<i>Jenny, run! Run!</i>

398
00:44:35,235 --> 00:44:37,526
Come on! Run!

399
00:44:47,736 --> 00:44:49,236
Aargh!

400
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:15,652
There's the bitch!

401
00:45:32,237 --> 00:45:33,862
Bitch!

402
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,445
<i>Well, fuck the bikes. Come on!</i>

403
00:45:44,862 --> 00:45:46,320
Ahh!

404
00:46:16,988 --> 00:46:19,029
Fuck!

405
00:46:27,446 --> 00:46:30,654
Get to the clearing. Guard the fucker.

406
00:46:53,697 --> 00:46:55,780
Right.

407
00:46:59,322 --> 00:47:01,447
Where is she?

408
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:16,905
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

409
00:47:20,655 --> 00:47:22,989
<i>- Brett, he's gone!
- What?</i>

410
00:47:23,114 --> 00:47:28,323
<i>- He's not here!
- Mate, he's cut to fuck. Follow the blood.</i>

411
00:47:29,031 --> 00:47:30,823
Come on!

412
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:51,573
Fuck's sake!

413
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:56,865
Oi! Oi!

414
00:48:46,366 --> 00:48:48,658
- Steve!
- Jenny...

415
00:48:48,783 --> 00:48:51,492
Come on! We've got to get out of here!

416
00:48:51,617 --> 00:48:53,783
Come on...

417
00:48:58,242 --> 00:49:00,283
Come on.

418
00:49:14,867 --> 00:49:16,908
Come on.

419
00:49:19,658 --> 00:49:21,742
This way.

420
00:49:32,576 --> 00:49:34,368
Aargh!

421
00:49:34,493 --> 00:49:36,784
Gently! All right?

422
00:49:37,951 --> 00:49:40,534
- I'm all right.
- That's it.

423
00:49:45,493 --> 00:49:51,118
<i>OK. We're going to clean you up,
all right? We're going to clean you up.</i>

424
00:49:54,243 --> 00:49:56,326
Drink some water.

425
00:49:57,993 --> 00:49:59,618
I'm...

426
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:02,951
Well done. All right.

427
00:50:03,993 --> 00:50:05,034
Em...

428
00:50:16,535 --> 00:50:19,410
<i>OK, this is going to sting.</i>

429
00:50:19,535 --> 00:50:20,577
OK...

430
00:50:20,702 --> 00:50:24,035
Well done. I know it does sting.

431
00:50:31,744 --> 00:50:35,869
<i>- Oh, shit!
- How does it look?</i>

432
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:41,285
- It looks worse than it is.
- Let me see.

433
00:50:44,077 --> 00:50:48,244
<i>Oh, Jesus! God!
That's black blood. Gut blood.</i>

434
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:52,536
- I'm fucking bleeding to death!
- You're not going to die!

435
00:50:52,661 --> 00:50:55,453
I'm not going to let you die! I'm not!

436
00:50:55,578 --> 00:51:00,370
They haven't hit any arteries.
Right. You've just got to stay calm.

437
00:51:00,495 --> 00:51:06,203
<i>Stay calm. You can't go into shock. Deep
breaths, measured breaths. Stay still.</i>

438
00:51:06,328 --> 00:51:11,536
<i>You're going to be all right. You'll be
all right, you'll be OK. I promise.</i>

439
00:51:13,411 --> 00:51:15,495
I'm so sorry.

440
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,370
I'm so sorry. I didn't know what to do.

441
00:51:26,536 --> 00:51:29,245
I thought Africa for a honeymoon.

442
00:51:31,745 --> 00:51:34,246
<i>Beach first, for a rest,</i>

443
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:36,454
and then safari.

444
00:51:37,787 --> 00:51:41,954
I don't care where we go
as long as I'm with you.

445
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,579
Africa sounds lovely.

446
00:51:50,912 --> 00:51:53,496
I even asked your old man.

447
00:52:01,454 --> 00:52:03,496
Shit!

448
00:52:07,537 --> 00:52:09,496
Other side.

449
00:52:10,662 --> 00:52:12,704
Ah... shit.

450
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:28,413
That's him. He's been here.

451
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:41,580
Find him and drain him
like a fucking bottle.

452
00:52:41,705 --> 00:52:46,038
<i>- I'm tired, Brett.
- Shut up, shite bag. Is that you?</i>

453
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:49,080
<i>Is that you, fat lad?</i>

454
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:56,998
<i>- No, not mine, mate.
- That's a girl's footprint.</i>

455
00:52:57,123 --> 00:53:00,206
<i>Well, she's with him, then.</i>

456
00:53:13,873 --> 00:53:19,081
That fucker can't be far.
He's nearly half fucking dead. Split up.

457
00:53:19,206 --> 00:53:23,706
<i>Spread out between here and the fence.
All right, come on.</i>

458
00:53:29,914 --> 00:53:32,414
You fat fuck!

459
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:40,207
<i>Get going.
Work off some of that weight, you fat shit.</i>

460
00:54:03,415 --> 00:54:05,374
Sorry...

461
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:26,875
Well done. Let's get your head down.

462
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,125
<i>That's it, that's it. Well done.
Well done.</i>

463
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:36,250
Steve?

464
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:40,375
<i>Steve! Steve, please...</i>

465
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:46,208
I've got to get us out of here. OK?

466
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:51,291
- I can't move.
- Then I've got to go. OK?

467
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:53,416
I'm safe here.

468
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:55,541
They've gone.

469
00:54:57,001 --> 00:55:01,167
<i>You need blood, Steve,
or you're going to die.</i>

470
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:05,292
I need to get to town.

471
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:14,376
I saw power pylons on the way in.

472
00:55:16,209 --> 00:55:18,709
They must lead somewhere.

473
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:35,792
Look.

474
00:55:35,917 --> 00:55:37,792
Look!

475
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:47,668
Now you stay hidden...
and you hold on.

476
00:55:47,793 --> 00:55:49,752
You come back.

477
00:56:48,419 --> 00:56:53,628
<i>- Brett, I'm really tired.
- Take a toke on this, you little shit!</i>

478
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,962
Come on!

479
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,004
Aaaaaiee! God!

480
00:57:19,045 --> 00:57:20,920
God!

481
00:57:21,045 --> 00:57:23,879
Aaaah! Aaaaah!

482
00:57:24,004 --> 00:57:26,920
<i>Oi, oi, oi! This way, yeah?</i>

483
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:45,338
Come on!

484
00:58:11,671 --> 00:58:13,338
Unnnngh!

485
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,796
Aaah!

486
00:58:41,256 --> 00:58:42,631
Arrgh!

487
00:58:53,047 --> 00:58:55,006
Aaaah!

488
00:59:26,882 --> 00:59:28,840
Unnngh!

489
01:00:15,341 --> 01:00:17,424
It's OK! It's...

490
01:00:17,549 --> 01:00:22,216
It's me. It's... It's Jenny.
Remember me from the lake?

491
01:00:25,384 --> 01:00:28,717
I just... I need some help.

492
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:34,967
I want to talk to your mum.
Can you take me to her?

493
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:40,300
She's working.

494
01:00:40,425 --> 01:00:42,384
But I'm...

495
01:00:46,967 --> 01:00:49,675
I really need to get into town.

496
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,800
Can you please just show me the way?

497
01:01:14,051 --> 01:01:18,843
<i>- Shouldn't we follow the power lines?
- No, this way's quicker.</i>

498
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:23,260
My mum picks me up down here.

499
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,926
What? Here?
In her car with your bike?

500
01:01:30,676 --> 01:01:32,635
What?

501
01:01:44,676 --> 01:01:48,802
<i>- Have you got a signal here?
- No, just games.</i>

502
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:51,636
She should be here soon.

503
01:01:53,427 --> 01:01:57,177
- I thought she was working.
- She's finished her shift.

504
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:02,677
- No signal?
- One bar.

505
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:06,469
<i>- Adam, I need your phone.
- We shouldn't be here!</i>

506
01:02:06,594 --> 01:02:09,302
- Please!
- Its battery's low!

507
01:02:09,427 --> 01:02:12,511
My mum might need to call me back!

508
01:02:14,261 --> 01:02:18,969
<i>Adam, your mum is coming to get you,
isn't she? Hmm?</i>

509
01:02:19,094 --> 01:02:21,261
<i>Adam, what's going on?</i>

510
01:02:21,386 --> 01:02:25,469
<i>Where have you brought me?
Please, Adam!</i>

511
01:02:25,594 --> 01:02:28,512
Please... just give me the bloody phone!

512
01:02:28,637 --> 01:02:31,512
How now brown cow!

513
01:02:57,178 --> 01:03:01,345
<i>She's awake!
Brett, she's fucking awake!</i>

514
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:06,470
<i>Mark, you fucking pussy!
You didn't hit her hard enough!</i>

515
01:03:08,429 --> 01:03:10,388
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

516
01:03:18,471 --> 01:03:20,971
We found him.

517
01:03:22,513 --> 01:03:27,221
<i>- Brett, we can't do this! She's alive!
- And he's dead.</i>

518
01:03:29,471 --> 01:03:32,388
We did him.

519
01:03:33,846 --> 01:03:36,763
Paige has got you all having a dig.

520
01:03:36,888 --> 01:03:42,263
<i>It's on her phone. No ballsing out now,
lads. No backing down.</i>

521
01:03:45,513 --> 01:03:48,763
<i>Oh, Jesus...</i>

522
01:03:51,347 --> 01:03:55,889
<i>- Paige, get filming. Come here.
- Oh, fuck it!</i>

523
01:03:58,847 --> 01:04:02,055
<i>Look at me, man. Wanna be in our gang?</i>

524
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,680
<i>Prove yourself, then.</i>

525
01:04:06,014 --> 01:04:10,639
<i>No, please...!
Adam, no, please... don't do it!</i>

526
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:13,680
<i>Please, don't do it! Please...!</i>

527
01:04:14,764 --> 01:04:17,305
Go on. Go on.

528
01:04:19,847 --> 01:04:22,847
<i>- What?
- Listen, you've seen too much.</i>

529
01:04:22,972 --> 01:04:26,680
<i>You either do it now, yeah, or you're next.</i>

530
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,306
<i>Go on, then.</i>

531
01:04:34,223 --> 01:04:36,806
Go on!

532
01:04:45,098 --> 01:04:47,556
No! No-o-o!

533
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:52,181
Stop!

534
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,640
That fucking stinks.

535
01:04:56,765 --> 01:05:01,973
<i>Fucking look at that! That was you.
That was fucking you, not me.</i>

536
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:04,806
- Fucking you.
- Please...!

537
01:05:04,931 --> 01:05:08,015
Fucking bitch. Ask her if it's warm.

538
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:11,015
Is it warm? Say it! Is it warm?

539
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:15,557
Fucking you do it an' all! Ask her!

540
01:05:15,682 --> 01:05:19,599
- Is it warm? Is it warm?
- Say it! Louder!

541
01:05:19,724 --> 01:05:22,016
Is it warm?

542
01:05:22,141 --> 01:05:25,849
<i>Fucking burn!
Burn, you little bitch! Go on!</i>

543
01:05:25,974 --> 01:05:31,391
<i>Yeah! Fucking hell! Fucking smile, boy.
You fucking love it.</i>

544
01:05:39,891 --> 01:05:42,307
<i>Oi, oi!</i>

545
01:05:47,307 --> 01:05:49,724
<i>Go on, then.</i>

546
01:05:55,558 --> 01:05:58,058
<i>Come here, you fucking shit!</i>

547
01:05:58,183 --> 01:06:02,058
You get the fuck back here
or I'll burn him!

548
01:06:02,183 --> 01:06:05,392
Come on! Come on!

549
01:06:06,558 --> 01:06:09,808
Right! Do him!

550
01:06:11,142 --> 01:06:13,642
<i>Help! Jenny, help!</i>

551
01:06:13,767 --> 01:06:15,850
Help! Help!

552
01:06:15,975 --> 01:06:17,850
Help!

553
01:06:24,225 --> 01:06:26,100
Aaargh!

554
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,311
<i>- OK...
- Brett, this way!</i>

555
01:08:53,979 --> 01:08:58,146
She's got the fucking map!
She knows which way to go.

556
01:08:58,271 --> 01:09:03,479
<i>No, we know which way she's fucking
going. There's one track into town.</i>

557
01:09:03,604 --> 01:09:06,687
- She won't go far on her foot.
- Look.

558
01:09:06,812 --> 01:09:10,604
What? What does it say?

559
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:15,271
<i>"Jenny Greengrass and Steve Taylor
attacked. Mark, Brett, Ricky, Cooper. "</i>

560
01:09:15,396 --> 01:09:18,105
<i>Shit, we're famous, mate!</i>

561
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:20,938
<i>- You got a match?
- No, mate.</i>

562
01:09:22,688 --> 01:09:24,772
<i>Fuck it, then.</i>

563
01:09:26,522 --> 01:09:32,188
<i>When I find that fucking bitch,
I'm going to fucking bury her, mate.</i>

564
01:09:35,063 --> 01:09:37,147
Fucking hell!

565
01:09:42,397 --> 01:09:45,313
<i>Little prick, come on.</i>

566
01:11:19,065 --> 01:11:21,025
Miss...

567
01:11:29,025 --> 01:11:30,816
Uurgh!

568
01:12:05,734 --> 01:12:08,442
I can't stand it...!

569
01:12:22,401 --> 01:12:24,359
No...!

570
01:12:28,442 --> 01:12:30,484
<i>No, no, no!</i>

571
01:12:51,568 --> 01:12:56,652
<i>- We're not going to find her in the dark!
- Yes, we fucking are! Go on!</i>

572
01:13:04,902 --> 01:13:06,860
Aaaargh!

573
01:13:07,902 --> 01:13:09,860
Brett!

574
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:12,860
- Paige?
- Brett!

575
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:24,903
- Brett!
- Paige!

576
01:13:47,611 --> 01:13:52,319
Look at what you've fucking done!
Fuck!

577
01:13:52,444 --> 01:13:56,611
<i>You know what, Brett?
Fuck this - I'm gone, mate.</i>

578
01:13:56,736 --> 01:13:57,986
What?

579
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:03,569
<i>No. No, no, no. Paige, phone.</i>

580
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:16,029
<i>Look! Look, look, look.
Look, look, it's you. That's you.</i>

581
01:14:16,154 --> 01:14:21,779
I didn't want this. I didn't want
to kill him or fucking burn that lad!

582
01:14:21,904 --> 01:14:25,029
- And I don't want to go to pen.
- Pen?

583
01:14:25,154 --> 01:14:27,862
What do you know about pen?

584
01:14:28,904 --> 01:14:33,487
Have you been inside?
Has your old man been inside?

585
01:14:33,612 --> 01:14:38,320
<i>What the fuck are you crying for,
you fucking girl?</i>

586
01:14:41,404 --> 01:14:43,695
Who you calling?

587
01:14:46,905 --> 01:14:50,113
Who you calling?

588
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:53,821
Put that down. Put that...

589
01:14:53,946 --> 01:14:57,571
Put that down. Put it down. Put it down.

590
01:14:57,696 --> 01:14:59,738
Put it down.

591
01:15:03,613 --> 01:15:07,321
- Brett!
- I'll fucking batter you!

592
01:15:07,446 --> 01:15:10,405
I'll fucking batter you!

593
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:12,446
Brett...!

594
01:15:12,571 --> 01:15:17,655
I... told... you... to... put... that... down!

595
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:21,321
Fucker! Fucker! Fucker! Fucker!

596
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:29,156
Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off.

597
01:15:29,281 --> 01:15:33,031
<i>Turn it off! Turn it off,
you fucking bitch!</i>

598
01:15:53,531 --> 01:15:55,114
Oh...

599
01:16:26,532 --> 01:16:30,823
- God! Are you OK?
- You've got to help me!

600
01:16:30,948 --> 01:16:35,490
<i>- Please, just get me out of here.
- Fuck! What's going on?</i>

601
01:16:35,615 --> 01:16:40,532
- They killed my boyfriend!
- All right! All right! Get in the car!

602
01:16:47,658 --> 01:16:51,616
- What happened back there?
- I'm being hunted.

603
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:55,908
- Hunted? By who?
- A gang. Just get me into town.

604
01:16:56,033 --> 01:17:00,408
- Town's the other way.
- Why the other way?

605
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:04,199
Me fucking brother's out here!

606
01:17:04,324 --> 01:17:09,116
- Your brother?
- My little brother. Now I'm worried.

607
01:17:09,241 --> 01:17:12,074
<i>- Oh, no...
- Ricky?</i>

608
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:15,241
<i>Ricky, are you OK? You ready?</i>

609
01:17:15,366 --> 01:17:20,158
<i>- I'll be there in two ticks. Yeah?
- No, please, stop! Turn around!</i>

610
01:17:20,283 --> 01:17:23,699
<i>- Please, go the other way!
- I will.</i>

611
01:17:36,825 --> 01:17:39,534
Fuck! They better be OK.

612
01:17:41,784 --> 01:17:43,742
Ricky?

613
01:17:45,742 --> 01:17:50,034
<i>Ricky?
Ricky, you little shite! Where are you?</i>

614
01:17:51,992 --> 01:17:57,284
Little bastard! I've got better things
to do. Mum's worried sick.

615
01:17:57,409 --> 01:18:01,200
This lady says she's been hunted.
You know about this?

616
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,825
Hey! Hey!

617
01:18:07,159 --> 01:18:08,950
Hey!

618
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:12,201
Hey!

619
01:18:23,618 --> 01:18:25,826
Aaaargh!

620
01:19:24,661 --> 01:19:26,036
Aah!

621
01:20:22,704 --> 01:20:27,288
# Please believe us
We ain't ever gonna be respectable

622
01:20:27,413 --> 01:20:30,579
<i># Like us, hate us, but you'll... #</i>

623
01:20:30,704 --> 01:20:33,913
<i>Somebody, please help me!</i>

624
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:38,496
<i>#... respectable, respectable... #</i>

625
01:20:41,579 --> 01:20:44,496
Don't just stand there!

626
01:20:48,663 --> 01:20:50,913
<i>- Get her in the house.
- Come on, then.</i>

627
01:20:54,497 --> 01:20:58,747
- You've been through the wars.
- What happened?

628
01:20:58,872 --> 01:21:04,664
<i>- Come on, give her some air.
- That stings, sorry... Thanks, Tan.</i>

629
01:21:04,789 --> 01:21:08,247
We'll put this down here.

630
01:21:08,372 --> 01:21:12,872
- You're safe now.
- Lots of big ugly men around.

631
01:21:13,705 --> 01:21:16,705
I'm still at Uncle Jon's.

632
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:20,789
<i>- A woman crashed in, looking like death.
- Mel!</i>

633
01:21:20,914 --> 01:21:24,039
That's a lovely ring. From your fella?

634
01:21:25,372 --> 01:21:27,872
What's that?

635
01:21:27,997 --> 01:21:31,664
<i>Hey, Clyde! Come here! Down! Out!</i>

636
01:21:31,789 --> 01:21:37,040
- You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
- Sorry. He's no good with strangers.

637
01:21:37,165 --> 01:21:40,915
<i>Mel? Mel, what's going on?</i>

638
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,956
What the fuck?! That's Reece's van!

639
01:21:45,081 --> 01:21:48,581
<i>- Go on, tell me!
- I'll fucking kill him!</i>

640
01:21:48,706 --> 01:21:52,665
- Hang on...
- Give me the fucking phone!

641
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:56,331
- Get me an ambulance.
- Jon?

642
01:21:56,456 --> 01:22:00,831
<i>Jon, get an ambulance.
Get this lady an ambulance.</i>

643
01:22:01,998 --> 01:22:06,873
<i>- I want the police.
- Eh? No, no, no. Don't worry, love.</i>

644
01:22:06,998 --> 01:22:09,706
You let us do that. Just stay here.

645
01:22:09,831 --> 01:22:14,248
- Ssh. You just sit quiet.
- I'm going to be sick.

646
01:22:14,373 --> 01:22:19,291
<i>I'll get you to the loo. Come on.
Come with me. Come on, love.</i>

647
01:22:21,374 --> 01:22:23,874
In here. Here we go.

648
01:22:24,916 --> 01:22:27,624
Lee Trevitt! Get out!

649
01:22:28,666 --> 01:22:30,749
Sorry about this.

650
01:22:31,582 --> 01:22:34,707
<i>Get out! Go on, love.</i>

651
01:22:40,332 --> 01:22:42,291
<i>Oh, God...</i>

652
01:22:49,707 --> 01:22:51,999
<i>Oh, God. Oh, God...</i>

653
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:36,250
Open the fucking door!

654
01:23:38,418 --> 01:23:40,501
Open it up!

655
01:23:40,626 --> 01:23:43,418
Open the fucking door!

656
01:23:52,918 --> 01:23:54,959
- Is this the lady?
- Yeah.

657
01:23:55,084 --> 01:23:59,251
<i>- You fucking slag! I'll fucking kill you!
- Come on, love!</i>

658
01:23:59,376 --> 01:24:03,543
- What's he told you? He's a liar!
- What about the van?!

659
01:24:03,668 --> 01:24:07,793
- They killed Steve!
- Your sick bastard boyfriend!

660
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:12,501
- Just call the police!
- What good are they to her?

661
01:24:15,418 --> 01:24:17,501
Fuck!

662
01:24:17,626 --> 01:24:21,460
You want to play with the big boys now?
Eh? Eh?

663
01:24:21,585 --> 01:24:23,669
Jon... Jon...

664
01:24:23,794 --> 01:24:26,294
She killed her little one.

665
01:24:26,419 --> 01:24:31,585
Look at her.
You fucking look at her now!

666
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:39,127
- You fucking keep looking at her.
- They're just children!

667
01:24:39,252 --> 01:24:42,252
Just children! They're just children!

668
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:45,252
I didn't mean to...

669
01:24:45,377 --> 01:24:49,460
- They started this!
- And we're gonna finish it.

670
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:53,460
<i>Look, there's dead kids, man.</i>

671
01:24:53,585 --> 01:24:57,877
- The police will ask questions.
- Doesn't mean they'll get any answers.

672
01:24:59,503 --> 01:25:02,211
We look after our own round here.

673
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:06,211
- Now... Now take Brett to bed.
- No...

674
01:25:06,336 --> 01:25:10,003
<i>Brett, get upstairs now!
You little bastard!</i>

675
01:25:10,128 --> 01:25:12,420
Get upstairs now.

676
01:25:13,795 --> 01:25:16,503
<i>- Please, don't...!
- Sssh.</i>

677
01:25:16,628 --> 01:25:19,295
Just put her in the shower.

678
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:21,295
No-o-o!
