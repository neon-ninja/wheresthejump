17
00:01:16,507 --> 00:01:18,372
Hitler's already dead.

18
00:01:18,374 --> 00:01:20,339
Short train ride
from Paris to Berlin,

19
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:23,440
and I get there
with this baby...

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,472
Pow!

21
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:27,339
We all go home.

22
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:42,141
That's a lot of boats!

23
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:48,740
I think I'd rather be up here.

24
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:51,639
Some Kraut bomber spots them

25
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:53,707
all squeezed together
like that,

26
00:01:54,373 --> 00:01:57,339
take out 20 at a time.

27
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:59,471
Tougher to shoot down
a plane.

28
00:01:59,473 --> 00:02:00,870
Hey, Rosenfeld!

29
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:04,305
More GIs die in planes
than boats. That's a fact.

30
00:02:05,707 --> 00:02:08,471
Don't listen to Tibbet, Rosenfeld.
He's full of shit.

31
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:09,971
Hey, Grunauer!

32
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:12,538
How do you say "full of shit"
in German again?

33
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:16,806
I love that.

34
00:02:25,872 --> 00:02:27,138
Hey.

35
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,706
Morton Chase.

36
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,804
I'm a photographer.

37
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:36,371
I heard the Sergeant say that
you were in Italy before this?

38
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:38,372
It's a great frame.
You mind if I snap

39
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:39,971
a couple pictures of you
looking out the window?

40
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:41,604
You know what I wouldn't mind,
Morton Chase,

41
00:02:41,606 --> 00:02:43,938
is you taking your ass
back to your seat.

42
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,572
You making friends
already, pretty boy?

43
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:49,404
- You know that guy?
- No.

44
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:51,171
Corporal
from Baker Company.

45
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:52,438
Last minute transfer.

46
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,838
I heard he got put in with us
for popping a captain.

47
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,938
He pops his C.O.
and gets a ride with us, huh?

48
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,837
So, what did we do wrong?

49
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:00,841
Uh, Boyce. Gum?

50
00:03:06,107 --> 00:03:09,171
What the fuck is this?
What's this, for luck?

51
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:10,072
Come on, man.

52
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:11,471
Shit, you're gonna need
more than that

53
00:03:11,473 --> 00:03:12,538
when we hit the ground.

54
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,804
Can you give me
my chain, please?

55
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:15,104
Ain't gonna be nothing
like boot camp,

56
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:17,738
not with those Jerries
firing real ammo.

57
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,338
And, hell, Boyce, you hardly
made it out of boot alive.

58
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,271
No lucky charm in the world

59
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:26,272
is gonna turn you
into a soldier.

60
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,404
Are you finished?

61
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:28,806
Are you gonna give me
the fucking chain?

62
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:32,638
- I'm screwing with you.
- Thanks.

63
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:41,138
Where's our drop zone, Nez?

64
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,570
The village of Cielblanc,
France, Sergeant!

65
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:45,670
And what is our target,
Grunauer?

66
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:47,405
Radio-jamming tower
on top of the church

67
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:48,938
near the town center,
Sergeant!

68
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,305
And why would the Nazis
put a radio-jamming tower

69
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:53,275
on top of a church,
Private Boyce?

70
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:58,638
Because they...

71
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,974
Good Christ Almighty, Boyce.

72
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:03,072
They put it
on a church because

73
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:05,637
the Nazis are
rotten sons of bitches.

74
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,237
And rotten sons of bitches
will do anything they have to

75
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,304
to destroy everything
that is good in this world!

76
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:14,638
That is why we have to be
just as rotten as they are.

77
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,871
Am I clear?

78
00:04:15,873 --> 00:04:18,538
Yes, Sergeant!

79
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,038
There are gonna be over
120,000 Allied soldiers

80
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,671
fighting their way
onto a French beach

81
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:24,738
in the name
of all that is good

82
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,874
and pure in this world.

83
00:04:27,872 --> 00:04:31,004
Those men are gonna need
air support!

84
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:33,737
That support will not make it
through Jerry's defenses

85
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:37,404
if we do not get
that tower down by 0600.

86
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:39,071
So what do you have to do?

87
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:41,205
Our goddamn job, Sergeant!

88
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:42,670
That's right.

89
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:44,937
Your goddamn job.

90
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:48,138
Corporal Ford here has joined
as our explosives expert.

91
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,838
You are lucky to have him.

92
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,805
You will obey his commands
as if you heard

93
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:55,372
my own beautiful voice
coming from his lips.

94
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:57,707
Our drop is 90 minutes out.

95
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:00,906
- Coo-ree!
- Coo-ree!

96
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:01,137
We must be
getting close.

97
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,938
Hope nothing goes wrong.

98
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,171
We miss our drop and land

99
00:06:04,173 --> 00:06:05,604
in the middle of
a German squad or something...

100
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:06,737
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

101
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:07,837
Because we both know
what the Nazis

102
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,004
are gonna do to a guy
named Rosenfeld.

103
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:10,637
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

104
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,504
It's just a little
Kraut hello, ladies.

105
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:18,805
Hold your seat and stay calm.

106
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:20,308
We jump
when the light tells us.

107
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:26,204
Isn't this fun, ladies?

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, shit!
Too much flak!
We're gonna have to drop
a couple of clicks south.
Copy that.

109
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,837
Didn't I tell you,
ladies,

110
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,773
I'd show you a good time?

111
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,905
We're gonna fucking die!

112
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:09,838
We're gonna fucking die!

113
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,307
Sarge, you got...

114
00:07:12,572 --> 00:07:13,971
- Murphy!
- Medic!

115
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:16,771
Settle down!
This is why we're here.

116
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:18,370
This is the job.

117
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,437
Grunauer, sit down!

118
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,138
Goddamn it, sit down!

119
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,138
I can save him!
I can save him!

120
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,770
He's dead! Sit down!
Everybody sit down!

121
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:33,941
Oh, shit!

122
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,241
Red level! Stand up.

123
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:43,040
Hook up.

124
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,473
Square up that line!

125
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,172
Wait for green.

126
00:07:50,174 --> 00:07:52,104
Oh, shit.

127
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:54,906
- See you on the ground.
- I'll be right behind you.

128
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:57,137
Jacob!

129
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:59,805
- I'll be right behind you.
- Okay.

130
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,407
Manual deploy!

131
00:08:21,873 --> 00:08:23,340
Tibbet, go!

132
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,907
Rosenfeld!

133
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,473
Go!

134
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:29,970
Fuck.

135
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

136
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,240
Jacob?

137
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,974
Jacob?

138
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:52,340
Jacob?

139
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

140
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:05,004
Sarge.

141
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:10,004
Any of you Krauts
got a cigarette?

142
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,370
You got to be
shitting me. None of you?

143
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:24,407
Well, that's goddamn...

144
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:38,738
Shut up. It's over.

145
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,638
You just let him die.

146
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,938
He was dead
before he hit the ground.

147
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,037
He fucking knew that.

148
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,470
What are you talking about?
We could've...

149
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,705
Done shit.

150
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:45,570
There were ten of them,

151
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:47,538
and I've seen how you hold
that rifle.

152
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,070
The Sergeant
wasn't the mission.

153
00:12:50,072 --> 00:12:53,606
We got to get that tower down
by 0600. Let's go.

154
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:10,571
Another click north,

155
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:13,838
we reach the rally point
at Cielblanc.

156
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,171
That's if the others
even made it.

157
00:13:16,173 --> 00:13:18,706
- Did you see anyone?
- No, just you.

158
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:21,171
And Sergeant Rensin.

159
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:22,870
Boyce, you keep worrying
about dead bodies,

160
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:25,103
you're gonna be one.

161
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,106
Well, Corporal, I had
friends on that plane.

162
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:29,770
Yeah.

163
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:31,439
Well, friends die.

164
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,373
Corporal.

165
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:45,604
Flash.

166
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:46,904
Thunder.

167
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:52,537
Welcome to France.

168
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:53,504
Hey, fellas!

169
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:55,204
- Shh.
- Oh, sorry.

170
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:57,737
I was afraid it was just
gonna be us three.

171
00:13:57,739 --> 00:13:59,071
He was afraid.

172
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:00,705
I was about to end it
if I had to listen

173
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,570
to Annie Oakley over here
for another minute.

174
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:04,671
Tibbet, how you doing
on explosives?

175
00:14:04,673 --> 00:14:05,870
I'm good.

176
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:08,873
Please tell me you got more
than just Boyce with you.

177
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,070
Goddamn it. Sorry.

178
00:14:12,072 --> 00:14:14,870
- You got your camera.
- Oh, jeez. Huh?

179
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:16,070
- You brought your camera.
- Yes.

180
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:17,338
- That made the jump?
- Yeah.

181
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,571
Wow, that's well-made.

182
00:14:18,573 --> 00:14:20,204
- Thank you.
- You get scenic shots with it?

183
00:14:20,206 --> 00:14:21,371
Uh, well, I think

184
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:23,170
they want me to take
some more of the action,

185
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:25,503
maybe get some scenes
from the frontline.

186
00:14:25,505 --> 00:14:28,837
Can I see that?
I can use that.

187
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,438
Just be careful with this.
You know, it's a fragile...

188
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,374
It's like wearing a spotlight around your neck.

189
00:14:34,971 --> 00:14:36,172
Sorry, man.

190
00:14:38,905 --> 00:14:40,371
Any sign of Rosenfeld?

191
00:14:40,373 --> 00:14:42,638
Saw Grunauer
about a mile east.

192
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,638
The Krauts had shot him
all to hell.

193
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,104
Shit. Not gonna be
nobody left to rally with.

194
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:50,805
Just keep smiling
through it, Tibbet.

195
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,004
Fuck France.

196
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:54,570
I bet you wish you were back
at Italy, huh, Corporal?

197
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:57,071
How'd you even end up
with us?

198
00:14:57,073 --> 00:14:58,936
I don't know, Tibbet.

199
00:14:58,938 --> 00:15:01,037
Why do you talk so much?

200
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,804
Some questions
don't have good answers.

201
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:06,473
I'm gonna put that
in my book, Corporal Ford.

202
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:09,271
Your book?

203
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Yeah. I've been writing it
since we got stationed.
Is that what you're
always scribbling about?
Jesus, Dawson, I didn't
think a hick like you
knew enough letters
to make a sentence,

204
00:15:17,273 --> 00:15:19,603
much less a fucking book.

205
00:15:19,605 --> 00:15:22,236
My mama writes her cookbooks
for the church back home.

206
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:23,637
I figured
I'd try it over here.

207
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,171
All the stuff regular folks
don't know.

208
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:27,903
What goes on
from basic to here.

209
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:31,204
Sounds thrilling. Bet you'll
sell a million copies.

210
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:32,474
I'd buy one.

211
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:34,570
Thanks, buddy.

212
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:36,604
And, Chase, I was thinking
maybe me and you

213
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:38,670
could team up, use some
of your pictures in it.

214
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,171
That way, you get a cut
of the profits...

215
00:16:02,206 --> 00:16:03,407
Boyce!

216
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:11,540
Boyce...
Boyce, walk on a line to me!

217
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,440
Boyce!

218
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:18,937
Where's Dawson?

219
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:20,936
- Where's Dawson?
- There is no Dawson.

220
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,640
Walk to me on a line like
you're on a fucking tightrope.

221
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:26,737
Fix your bayonet

222
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:28,805
and probe to my line.

223
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:36,304
Come on. We got to go!

224
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:42,039
Chase,
get right on his tracks.

225
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:45,440
Move it, keep coming.

226
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:54,503
Hey, hey, hey, get up.
Point your weapon that way.

227
00:16:54,505 --> 00:16:56,571
Anyone want to come
over here and get me?

228
00:16:56,573 --> 00:16:59,036
Use your rifle.
Light taps.

229
00:16:59,038 --> 00:17:01,303
Not hard enough
to set off a mine.

230
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:03,307
Exactly how hard
is too hard?

231
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:05,374
You'll know.

232
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:09,607
Move it. We need to get
to the tree line.

233
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,040
He was there

234
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:49,773
and then he wasn't.

235
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,973
But you still are.

236
00:17:56,238 --> 00:17:58,973
So get your head right.
We got a job to do.

237
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:02,304
What the hell is this?

238
00:18:02,306 --> 00:18:04,303
A dog, maybe?

239
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:06,670
Oh. Smells like shit.

240
00:18:06,672 --> 00:18:09,237
- What is that on it?
- Looks like an eyeball.

241
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:10,403
That's not normal.

242
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:11,937
Hey, turn off
the fucking light.

243
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:13,271
Jesus, sorry.

244
00:18:13,273 --> 00:18:15,607
Goddamn it, doesn't matter
what it...

245
00:18:17,205 --> 00:18:18,471
What it is.

246
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:19,940
That's not a dog.

247
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:22,736
Kind of looks
like a jackal.

248
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:25,439
- A jackal?
- Yeah, you know, Satan's dogs?

249
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,338
Patrol hell.

250
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,870
Rip the spirit
right out of your body

251
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:30,470
and take it straight
to the devil.

252
00:18:30,472 --> 00:18:32,204
Where do you come up
with this shit?

253
00:18:32,206 --> 00:18:33,403
What do you mean?

254
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,338
How do these things
pop into your head?

255
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,538
The Bible.

256
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,637
The Bible.

257
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:39,470
How many jackals
have you seen with a hoof?

258
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:40,737
That's exactly
my point.

259
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:42,470
This is not
your average jackal.

260
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:43,872
Hey!

261
00:18:58,173 --> 00:18:59,371
Corporal,
what do we do?

262
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:01,371
She can't let anyone
know we're here.

263
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,906
Grab her. Grab her.

264
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:28,537
Easy. Easy, easy. Easy.

265
00:19:36,138 --> 00:19:38,839
Boyce, official translator.
All right.

266
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:45,670
Our girl's a scavenger.

267
00:19:45,672 --> 00:19:48,172
Cielblanc?
Is that your village?

268
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:50,872
Cielblanc?

269
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:54,639
Germans? Many Germans?

270
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,040
Here.

271
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:14,905
Boyce, tell her
to lead the way.

272
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:24,438
This?

273
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,640
Here.

274
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:12,172
Fucking Nazis.

275
00:21:28,738 --> 00:21:31,737
Corporal? This is it.

276
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:33,605
What are we gonna find
in there?

277
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:41,903
Just an
aunt and kid brother.

278
00:21:41,905 --> 00:21:45,071
Okay. We're gonna find out
if she's telling the truth.

279
00:21:45,073 --> 00:21:46,803
Boyce, you stay here.

280
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,936
If she runs, shoot her.

281
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:50,438
Let's go.

282
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:11,870
No. No.

283
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,737
Girl tip them off?

284
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:05,569
No. I don't think
she likes the Germans

285
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:07,004
any more than we do.

286
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:09,770
Because they're pigs.

287
00:24:09,772 --> 00:24:11,973
I needed to make sure
you weren't as well.

288
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:14,940
This way.

289
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:19,137
Oh, man,
that's beautiful.

290
00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:21,003
<i>Ooh la la la. Oui, oui.</i>
Oh, you know,

291
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:24,873
we go to Eiffel Tower and all that shit.

292
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,636
What the hell is that?

293
00:24:44,638 --> 00:24:46,839
My aunt. She's sick.

294
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:02,738
- Be quiet.
- Me?

295
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,437
Tell this kid not to do
creepy shit like that.

296
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:13,338
Is she gonna be a problem?

297
00:25:14,372 --> 00:25:15,373
No.

298
00:25:15,905 --> 00:25:17,438
She's very sick.

299
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:28,140
<i>Bonjour.</i>

300
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:39,869
A lot of Krauts
moving around out there.

301
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,737
Two buzzsaws by my count.

302
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:44,204
And that wall
is well fortified, too.

303
00:25:44,206 --> 00:25:45,270
Everybody de-rig.

304
00:25:45,272 --> 00:25:47,602
All the explosives and timers
on this table,

305
00:25:47,604 --> 00:25:49,139
and I need a count.

306
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:51,870
Ma'am.

307
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,402
Have you been inside
that compound?

308
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:54,536
No.

309
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:55,969
The trucks go in and out,

310
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,637
but we are shot
if we go near it.

311
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,502
We'll have to clock their
patrols and scale it in a gap.

312
00:26:00,504 --> 00:26:02,336
Oh, and hope that
there's not a firing squad

313
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:03,836
waiting for us
behind that wall?

314
00:26:03,838 --> 00:26:05,204
We just need
enough time to place

315
00:26:05,206 --> 00:26:06,837
the explosives on that tower.

316
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,837
Tibbet, if we could put you
in a good position,

317
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,171
you think you could keep
those buzzsaws off

318
00:26:10,173 --> 00:26:12,171
Chase and I if they see us
dropping over?

319
00:26:12,173 --> 00:26:13,037
Wait, what?

320
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,637
I mean, I can
buy you some time,

321
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,235
but once I start popping,
they're gonna be coming out

322
00:26:16,237 --> 00:26:17,770
of every door.
I can't cover that.

323
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:19,269
Well, what if I...

324
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:20,370
I'm not sure that I'm the best
person to climb the tower.

325
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:21,737
Maybe I could go.

326
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:34,969
What are
they doing with them?

327
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:36,639
What they've done to so many.

328
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:39,339
To my parents.

329
00:26:43,371 --> 00:26:45,502
- Oh, shit!
- Jesus Christ.

330
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:46,803
You can't stay here.

331
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,003
They patrol all night,
inspecting houses,

332
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:50,338
doing whatever they like.

333
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:56,737
We just need to stay here
till that tower comes down

334
00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:58,070
in less than four hours.

335
00:26:58,072 --> 00:26:59,405
Don't worry, sweetheart.

336
00:27:01,706 --> 00:27:03,137
Oh, Jesus!

337
00:27:03,139 --> 00:27:05,537
We got to put a bell on this
little fucker, or something.

338
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,469
There's a lot of
soldiers out there

339
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:11,305
and there's only four of us.

340
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:12,640
So,

341
00:27:13,772 --> 00:27:15,037
maybe we should wait.

342
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,502
See if more of our guys
show up first.

343
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:18,569
Pretty boy, you finally said
something smart.

344
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:20,870
- Thank you.
- Corporal, there is no sense

345
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:23,203
committing suicide
over some tower.

346
00:27:23,205 --> 00:27:24,669
We all heard the Sergeant.

347
00:27:24,671 --> 00:27:26,603
The planes can't provide
air support

348
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,969
to the beaches unless
we take the tower out.

349
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:30,969
- Oh, listen to you!
- Right?

350
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:32,136
All of a sudden

351
00:27:32,138 --> 00:27:33,637
talking like a real soldier
there, Boyce.

352
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:35,539
And what are you prepared to
do to take out those Krauts?

353
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:38,469
Whatever I have to.

354
00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:39,403
Whatever you have to.

355
00:27:39,405 --> 00:27:41,071
And what is that exactly?
Tell me more.

356
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:42,169
What's your point, Tibbet?

357
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:44,205
My point is you couldn't
even kill a mouse,

358
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:46,170
could you?

359
00:27:46,172 --> 00:27:47,903
Corporal, you've got to
hear this.

360
00:27:47,905 --> 00:27:49,402
We had this mouse, he
gets in the barracks

361
00:27:49,404 --> 00:27:50,302
back at base, right?

362
00:27:50,304 --> 00:27:51,969
The thing's shitting
all over the place,

363
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:53,703
so Sarge, he orders
somebody to kill it.

364
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,537
So Boyce here,
he catches the thing

365
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:58,135
in his boot and he sets it
loose in a field.

366
00:27:58,137 --> 00:28:00,203
But the mouse comes back
the next night,

367
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:02,337
and it's crapping all over
Sarge's pillow.

368
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:03,936
So Sarge, he has us
running up hills

369
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
all morning for that shit.

370
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You're not built
for this, Boyce.
Even if you were, there's
10 Krauts to every one of us.
Tibbet, enough!

371
00:28:21,205 --> 00:28:22,970
And go see if anyone else
made it to the rally point.

372
00:28:22,972 --> 00:28:25,303
- Take Chase with you.
- Oh, goddamn it.

373
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:27,669
Chase, go. And be back here
at 0300.

374
00:28:29,072 --> 00:28:30,372
What?

375
00:28:30,938 --> 00:28:32,037
What?

376
00:28:33,472 --> 00:28:35,003
It's all pops and clicks.

377
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,269
I don't understand
what you're saying.

378
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:37,804
He asked if
you wanted to play.

379
00:28:37,806 --> 00:28:39,803
He thinks all Americans
play baseball.

380
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:42,103
Yeah, well, not this one.

381
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:44,069
Tell him to get a pool cue
and five bucks

382
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:45,569
and we'll be in business.

383
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:46,639
Chase, move it!

384
00:28:48,939 --> 00:28:50,206
Ma'am?

385
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:51,705
Thank you.

386
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,636
I need you to go downstairs and
make sure everything stays clear.

387
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:03,870
Right, but Tibbet and Chase,
they probably need a little...

388
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,273
Boyce, go.

389
00:30:09,871 --> 00:30:11,505
I told you my aunt was sick.

390
00:30:19,605 --> 00:30:20,673
What happened to her?

391
00:30:25,171 --> 00:30:26,639
I don't know.

392
00:30:27,504 --> 00:30:29,370
Ask the Germans.

393
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:32,539
She hasn't spoken since I
got her back from the church.

394
00:30:36,171 --> 00:30:37,572
I need to clean that.

395
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:01,405
Let's go!

396
00:31:11,005 --> 00:31:14,172
I liked the story
about the mouse.

397
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:17,537
Your English is good.

398
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:20,402
I went
to university in London

399
00:31:20,404 --> 00:31:22,472
to be a veterinarian.

400
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:24,740
Then the war came,

401
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:27,473
and everything changed.

402
00:31:28,204 --> 00:31:29,405
That's Paul.

403
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:32,272
And I'm Chloe.

404
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:34,639
I'm Ed.

405
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:02,770
Your French
has a different sound.

406
00:32:02,772 --> 00:32:06,670
My grandmother taught me.
She was from Haiti.

407
00:32:06,672 --> 00:32:10,868
But she moved to the States.
She was in Louisiana.

408
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,205
I don't know Louisiana.

409
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:18,672
It's hot.

410
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,273
It's hot.

411
00:32:23,205 --> 00:32:24,539
And, um,

412
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:27,272
there is no war there?

413
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:29,706
Not like this.

414
00:32:40,037 --> 00:32:42,703
You said before that, um,

415
00:32:42,705 --> 00:32:44,904
the Germans, they took
your parents?

416
00:32:46,904 --> 00:32:48,640
Our father first.

417
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:52,170
A few weeks later
they come for our mother.

418
00:32:52,172 --> 00:32:54,202
The German doctor,

419
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:55,769
he believes the tar
in the ground

420
00:32:55,771 --> 00:32:57,238
has some kind of a power.

421
00:32:59,205 --> 00:33:01,339
He calls it his science.

422
00:33:02,771 --> 00:33:05,769
But it's just an excuse
to kill us.

423
00:35:48,971 --> 00:35:50,106
Hmm?

424
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:05,006
Hmm?

425
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:46,771
Get up, you piece of shit.

426
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:55,672
You okay?

427
00:40:00,404 --> 00:40:02,206
She is for now.

428
00:40:04,104 --> 00:40:06,969
But none of you will be
for very long.

429
00:40:12,503 --> 00:40:14,868
Don't worry about us, Franz.

430
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,739
I like our odds a whole lot
better than yours right now.

431
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,272
This is very nice.

432
00:40:35,971 --> 00:40:37,169
Did your boss give this
to you

433
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:39,371
for hitting
your execution quota?

434
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:59,936
I need some kind of sack.

435
00:40:59,938 --> 00:41:02,668
Boyce, you just put the whole
fucking mission at risk.

436
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,835
Corporal, we couldn't just
let her...

437
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:06,336
Shut up.
Go get Tibbet and Chase.

438
00:41:07,737 --> 00:41:09,739
We got to move on that tower.

439
00:43:33,805 --> 00:43:35,935
Oh, fuck!

440
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

441
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

442
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,169
Shit!

443
00:51:33,703 --> 00:51:34,834
Jacob?

444
00:51:44,137 --> 00:51:45,838
Shh. Be quiet.

445
00:52:38,669 --> 00:52:40,803
We got to get
the hell out of here.

446
00:52:49,438 --> 00:52:50,767
No, wait.

447
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:54,571
I'm sorry. Listen to me!
I have to pull it out, okay?

448
00:52:55,303 --> 00:52:57,504
This might hurt. Sorry.

449
00:52:59,036 --> 00:53:00,537
Come on. Come on.

450
00:53:33,737 --> 00:53:34,935
What now?

451
00:53:38,338 --> 00:53:39,870
Yeah, here.

452
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:42,603
Here. Cover us.

453
00:54:01,103 --> 00:54:02,137
Hurry.

454
00:54:17,803 --> 00:54:18,804
Come on.

455
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,902
It's been too long.

456
00:54:54,904 --> 00:54:57,571
Ten bucks says
Boyce got himself grabbed.

457
00:55:09,804 --> 00:55:12,271
Don't you got yourself a dog
to play with or something?

458
00:55:23,703 --> 00:55:26,104
Jesus, Chase.
Enough with the camera.

459
00:55:38,171 --> 00:55:39,667
No luck?

460
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:40,901
I sent him to you.

461
00:55:40,903 --> 00:55:43,035
So it's my fault
Boyce didn't show up?

462
00:55:43,037 --> 00:55:45,534
You said wait at the bridge.
I waited.

463
00:55:45,536 --> 00:55:47,234
It's a miracle I even
kept Jughead here alive.

464
00:55:47,236 --> 00:55:48,970
Hey! Some help!

465
00:55:52,804 --> 00:55:53,968
What happened to him?

466
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:55,168
I found him
inside the church.

467
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,600
Krauts grabbed me
as soon as I hit the ground.

468
00:55:57,602 --> 00:55:59,535
Woke up with all kinds of
shit stuck in me.

469
00:55:59,537 --> 00:56:02,734
Inside the church? How did
you get inside the church?

470
00:56:02,736 --> 00:56:04,335
On dead bodies.

471
00:56:04,337 --> 00:56:05,534
Slow down. Slow down.

472
00:56:05,536 --> 00:56:08,001
Listen to me. They're doing
experiments on them in there.

473
00:56:08,003 --> 00:56:09,735
They're doing experiments
on the villagers!

474
00:56:09,737 --> 00:56:11,134
- What?
- Just like her aunt.

475
00:56:11,136 --> 00:56:12,701
They're burning people
with these flamethrowers,

476
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,135
and they're still moving,
the bodies...

477
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,701
And they're pumping tar
from the ground

478
00:56:15,703 --> 00:56:16,967
into these cocoon things...

479
00:56:16,969 --> 00:56:19,400
Breathe. Did you get eyes
on the tower compound?

480
00:56:19,402 --> 00:56:20,867
She doesn't have a body

481
00:56:20,869 --> 00:56:23,336
and she's still talking,
and I saw Rosenfeld...

482
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,734
Boyce!

483
00:56:24,736 --> 00:56:27,305
Did you get eyes
on the tower compound?

484
00:56:31,704 --> 00:56:33,870
- The tower base...
- Yeah.

485
00:56:34,704 --> 00:56:36,134
...is below the ground.

486
00:56:36,136 --> 00:56:37,935
But there's more than that
down there.

487
00:56:37,937 --> 00:56:39,437
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Look.

488
00:56:48,237 --> 00:56:49,838
What the hell is that?

489
00:56:57,338 --> 00:56:58,871
What is this shit?

490
00:57:02,036 --> 00:57:03,367
What is that, German?

491
00:57:03,369 --> 00:57:04,767
I don't understand German.
Do you understand German?

492
00:57:04,769 --> 00:57:06,202
I don't speak German.

493
00:57:06,204 --> 00:57:09,468
I'm simply
an officer for the <i>Fuhrer.</i>

494
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:12,668
I know nothing
of what the doctor does.

495
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,938
- Oh, you don't?
- No.

496
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:21,001
Well, I don't think that the, uh, private
here, I don't think he believes you.

497
00:57:21,003 --> 00:57:24,068
I saw your men and the doctor
burn those people.

498
00:57:25,769 --> 00:57:27,201
This is war, <i>ja?</i>

499
00:57:28,104 --> 00:57:31,205
People die
in many unfortunate ways.

500
00:57:31,602 --> 00:57:33,135
I'm sure your

501
00:57:33,137 --> 00:57:35,804
corporal has killed
many people.

502
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:42,971
Oh, yeah. Hey.

503
00:57:43,536 --> 00:57:44,935
Stay focused.

504
00:57:44,937 --> 00:57:46,135
I'm on the clock here, Franz,

505
00:57:46,137 --> 00:57:47,468
so if you don't tell me
what I need to know,

506
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:50,068
the private here is gonna
paint this room with you.

507
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,701
What do you do
with those people

508
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:55,504
that you take
into that church?

509
00:58:00,036 --> 00:58:02,903
They have been given
a purpose.

510
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:28,768
Get her off!

511
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:31,005
Get her the fuck
out of here.

512
00:58:36,803 --> 00:58:38,336
Ugh.

513
00:58:41,136 --> 00:58:43,271
Sorry about that.

514
00:58:44,603 --> 00:58:45,734
Now,

515
00:58:45,736 --> 00:58:46,835
we don't need this

516
00:58:46,837 --> 00:58:48,904
because it's got nothing
to do with us.

517
00:58:51,602 --> 00:58:52,804
Fuck you.

518
00:59:04,502 --> 00:59:05,503
Get him up.

519
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:19,902
- What are we doing now?
- Hoist him up.

520
00:59:19,904 --> 00:59:22,104
- What?
- Hoist him up.

521
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:26,068
<i>Nein. Nein.</i>

522
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,702
Corporal, why do we need
to hoist him up for?

523
00:59:27,704 --> 00:59:30,102
We know he's not gonna talk.
You said we have to move.

524
00:59:30,104 --> 00:59:31,971
We have a mission, right?

525
00:59:34,136 --> 00:59:35,434
Right?

526
00:59:40,837 --> 00:59:42,504
You know
what I need to know.

527
00:59:47,836 --> 00:59:49,902
What's inside that
compound wall of yours?

528
00:59:49,904 --> 00:59:52,005
Men, weapons, everything.

529
00:59:53,203 --> 00:59:54,370
Hmm?

530
00:59:55,804 --> 00:59:57,271
Fuck you.

531
00:59:59,704 --> 01:00:00,904
Hey, Franz...

532
01:00:04,603 --> 01:00:06,404
I'm gonna win this one.

533
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:21,401
You're gonna fucking talk.
You're gonna fucking talk.

534
01:00:28,536 --> 01:00:29,435
Ford!

535
01:00:29,437 --> 01:00:31,638
- What?
- What the hell are we doing?

536
01:00:33,235 --> 01:00:35,568
You think this asshole
deserves better?

537
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:36,968
We're not him!

538
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,868
You want to beat them,

539
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:41,101
you play just as dirty
as they do.

540
01:00:41,103 --> 01:00:43,038
Now get the fuck back.

541
01:00:52,103 --> 01:00:55,133
How many men you have
behind that wall?

542
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:58,670
How many troops
inside that compound?

543
01:01:06,536 --> 01:01:08,336
Get the fuck out of here.

544
01:01:57,369 --> 01:01:59,834
Three months ago, I was

545
01:01:59,836 --> 01:02:02,568
cutting grass
in my front yard

546
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:05,504
and the mailman shows up
with a letter from the Army.

547
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:07,637
Now I'm here.

548
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
With no idea of where
I'm gonna end up.

549
01:02:34,837 --> 01:02:37,068
If we can believe him,

550
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:39,334
they got at least
40 men inside the wall.

551
01:02:39,336 --> 01:02:43,301
Forty? Well,
definitely that's too many.

552
01:02:43,303 --> 01:02:44,401
Right? It's too many.

553
01:02:44,403 --> 01:02:46,300
It'll make it tough
to slip by.

554
01:02:46,302 --> 01:02:47,967
Tibbet'll have to keep them
busy long enough

555
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:49,703
for you and me
to rig that tower.

556
01:02:50,769 --> 01:02:52,701
You still going
with that plan?

557
01:02:52,703 --> 01:02:54,034
It's all we got.

558
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,167
You know,
there might be access

559
01:02:55,169 --> 01:02:56,368
to the tower from inside.

560
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:57,968
I mean, I saw some kind of
operations room

561
01:02:57,970 --> 01:02:59,567
when I was down there.

562
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:01,335
So we gotta fight our way
into the church

563
01:03:01,337 --> 01:03:02,834
and then
fight our way out? No.

564
01:03:02,836 --> 01:03:04,300
It's better to stay outside.

565
01:03:04,302 --> 01:03:06,203
Sixty minutes until
they hit the beach.

566
01:03:07,837 --> 01:03:10,435
You got a vehicle we can use?
You won't get it back.

567
01:03:10,437 --> 01:03:12,237
My father kept one
in the garage.

568
01:03:13,403 --> 01:03:16,067
Chase, go get the Kraut
ready to travel.

569
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:18,203
We're gonna use him
to draw a crowd.

570
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,471
Show me this garage.

571
01:03:33,804 --> 01:03:35,604
Hey. Time to move.

572
01:04:01,602 --> 01:04:03,570
Hey. Fella.

573
01:04:05,503 --> 01:04:06,638
Wake up.

574
01:04:11,903 --> 01:04:13,704
I think I'm gonna need
some help...

575
01:04:14,569 --> 01:04:18,867
No! No! Stop it! Stop!
Let go! No!

576
01:04:18,869 --> 01:04:20,270
Help!

577
01:04:22,503 --> 01:04:23,504
Chase!

578
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:35,838
Hey, hey, hey.

579
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:40,735
Chase, Chase, Chase.

580
01:04:40,737 --> 01:04:42,204
He was asleep.

581
01:04:43,903 --> 01:04:45,835
He was asleep.

582
01:04:45,837 --> 01:04:46,967
Goddamn it.

583
01:04:46,969 --> 01:04:48,567
Shut up.
It's not your fault.

584
01:04:48,569 --> 01:04:50,966
- Put pressure on it.
- Yeah, put pressure.

585
01:04:50,968 --> 01:04:52,601
Is it bad? Is it bad?

586
01:04:52,603 --> 01:04:54,668
Shh. Just look at me.
You're fine. You're fine.

587
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:56,501
- How's he doing?
- Chase.

588
01:04:56,503 --> 01:04:59,067
Open your mouth, huh.
There you go.

589
01:04:59,069 --> 01:05:01,368
Hey, Ed?
Don't let me die, okay?

590
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:03,901
You're not gonna die.
You're all right.

591
01:05:03,903 --> 01:05:05,001
You're all right.

592
01:05:05,003 --> 01:05:06,368
Pressure, put pressure.

593
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:09,033
Come on, Chase.
It's gonna be okay, son.

594
01:05:09,035 --> 01:05:10,901
I don't feel good.

595
01:05:10,903 --> 01:05:13,000
Stay down, stay down.

596
01:05:13,002 --> 01:05:15,435
Chase, relax, relax, relax.

597
01:05:15,437 --> 01:05:17,467
You're all right.

598
01:05:17,469 --> 01:05:19,400
You're all right, Chase.
Just stay with us.

599
01:05:19,402 --> 01:05:21,067
Look at me, Chase,
look at me.

600
01:05:21,069 --> 01:05:23,001
Chase. Chase.

601
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:24,471
Where's my camera?

602
01:05:24,902 --> 01:05:26,634
It's right here.

603
01:05:26,636 --> 01:05:27,902
It's your camera.

604
01:05:30,603 --> 01:05:31,738
Chase.

605
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:37,067
Chase.

606
01:05:43,603 --> 01:05:44,703
Chase.

607
01:05:52,136 --> 01:05:54,400
Let me put a bullet
in his fat Kraut face!

608
01:05:54,402 --> 01:05:55,500
No, no, no, no,
we still need him.

609
01:05:55,502 --> 01:05:56,804
I'll get you another one!

610
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,638
What are you doing?

611
01:06:25,704 --> 01:06:27,300
Boyce, he's dead.

612
01:06:27,302 --> 01:06:30,300
Rosenfeld, get these explosives
off the table. We need to move.

613
01:06:30,302 --> 01:06:32,233
If they haven't heard us
by now, they just did.

614
01:06:32,235 --> 01:06:33,570
Move it!

615
01:06:34,135 --> 01:06:36,200
Keep moving. Move!

616
01:06:36,202 --> 01:06:39,335
Boyce, explosives, now.

617
01:06:39,337 --> 01:06:41,534
Come on. Air support
can't cover that beach

618
01:06:41,536 --> 01:06:43,668
as long as that tower's
still up.

619
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:45,667
What are you
smiling at, buddy?

620
01:06:50,369 --> 01:06:51,969
Holy Christ.

621
01:06:52,603 --> 01:06:53,936
Uh...

622
01:06:56,669 --> 01:06:59,937
You asked what the
serum was, Corporal.

623
01:07:03,235 --> 01:07:04,370
I'm thirsty.

624
01:07:06,337 --> 01:07:08,737
How do you...
How do you feel?

625
01:07:16,768 --> 01:07:18,637
I feel really good.

626
01:07:24,236 --> 01:07:25,969
Doesn't even hurt.

627
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:30,603
Not as bad
as it looks, I guess.

628
01:07:35,868 --> 01:07:37,300
That's weird.

629
01:07:37,302 --> 01:07:39,304
Add it to the list.

630
01:07:41,835 --> 01:07:43,371
- Chase?
- Huh?

631
01:07:44,203 --> 01:07:45,671
Can you stand up?

632
01:07:45,969 --> 01:07:47,133
Yeah.

633
01:07:47,135 --> 01:07:49,536
Whoa, whoa. Easy.

634
01:07:51,869 --> 01:07:53,603
Is it hot in here?

635
01:07:55,536 --> 01:07:57,603
I feel hot.

636
01:08:01,269 --> 01:08:03,667
- Chase.
- Chase.

637
01:08:03,669 --> 01:08:06,404
- Maybe you should sit down.
- My head hurts.

638
01:08:19,169 --> 01:08:20,637
What the fuck?

639
01:08:21,836 --> 01:08:22,903
Ed?

640
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:25,637
- Chase?
- Oh, my God.

641
01:08:27,968 --> 01:08:29,902
- Shit.
- Jesus.

642
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:32,604
My head hurts.

643
01:08:33,236 --> 01:08:35,137
Whoa, Chase.

644
01:08:35,902 --> 01:08:36,868
Chase, sit down.

645
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:39,000
Jesus Christ, Chase!
Jesus Christ!

646
01:08:40,269 --> 01:08:41,867
What's wrong with him?

647
01:08:41,869 --> 01:08:43,100
I don't know.

648
01:08:48,103 --> 01:08:49,104
Chase.

649
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:58,837
I'm gonna
fucking shoot him.

650
01:08:59,536 --> 01:09:00,834
Corporal,
no, please.

651
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,870
Corporal, relax, please.
Chase.

652
01:09:03,402 --> 01:09:04,467
Hey, pal.

653
01:09:04,469 --> 01:09:05,604
Hey, Chase?

654
01:09:08,402 --> 01:09:10,700
What did you do to me, Ed?

655
01:09:11,603 --> 01:09:13,736
- What did you do?
- Chase, stop!

656
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:41,503
What just happened?

657
01:09:42,602 --> 01:09:44,204
A Thousand-Year Reich

658
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:48,571
needs thousand-year soldiers.

659
01:09:55,203 --> 01:09:57,471
You got to be
shitting me.

660
01:10:12,003 --> 01:10:13,004
Boyce.

661
01:10:14,269 --> 01:10:15,334
Boyce!

662
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,468
Hey. Hey.
It's over. It's over!

663
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:20,534
It's over! It wasn't him.
That was not Chase.

664
01:10:20,536 --> 01:10:22,801
You hear me? It wasn't Chase.

665
01:10:22,803 --> 01:10:24,334
Holy shit.

666
01:10:24,336 --> 01:10:25,534
Does somebody want to tell me

667
01:10:25,536 --> 01:10:27,737
what the fuck
is going on here?

668
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:42,637
- Paul.
- Goddamn it!

669
01:10:43,403 --> 01:10:45,902
Chloe!

670
01:10:46,669 --> 01:10:48,903
Chloe!

671
01:11:01,868 --> 01:11:03,004
Fuck!

672
01:11:16,602 --> 01:11:18,070
Get down!

673
01:11:36,535 --> 01:11:39,435
No! Paul! Paul!

674
01:11:39,437 --> 01:11:41,303
Chloe!

675
01:11:42,203 --> 01:11:43,301
Fuck!

676
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:44,669
Paul!

677
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:46,767
Damn it!

678
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,634
We got to move. We take down
that tower right now.

679
01:11:49,636 --> 01:11:51,401
Boyce, you and I are
climbing it.

680
01:11:51,403 --> 01:11:52,566
Tibbet and Rosenfeld
will cover us.

681
01:11:52,568 --> 01:11:53,667
Corporal, wait,
what about the kid?

682
01:11:53,669 --> 01:11:54,834
Come on, we got to move!
Goddamn it!

683
01:11:54,836 --> 01:11:57,934
They grabbed him
because of us. Wait, wait.

684
01:11:57,936 --> 01:12:00,067
And the labs? The shit
they're doing down there?

685
01:12:00,069 --> 01:12:02,001
That doesn't matter!
They're not our mission.

686
01:12:02,003 --> 01:12:03,800
We take out the tower,
troops come in

687
01:12:03,802 --> 01:12:05,534
and deal with whatever's
below ground later.

688
01:12:05,536 --> 01:12:07,033
Her brother will be dead
by then.

689
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:08,701
You forget
what your job is, Private?

690
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,034
It's about more than
that now, Corporal!

691
01:12:10,036 --> 01:12:12,167
Do I have to drag your ass
up that fucking tower?

692
01:12:12,169 --> 01:12:14,667
Yes, you do. Because I'm not
leaving him down there.

693
01:12:14,669 --> 01:12:16,137
I gave you an order!

694
01:12:31,203 --> 01:12:32,204
No.

695
01:12:34,102 --> 01:12:35,104
No.

696
01:12:36,902 --> 01:12:38,636
No. No!

697
01:12:39,235 --> 01:12:41,234
We have to do this!

698
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:43,337
You know we have to do this,
Corporal.

699
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:46,499
I can get us inside.

700
01:12:46,501 --> 01:12:49,433
I can. I can get us inside!

701
01:12:49,435 --> 01:12:50,833
We can blow the tower
from below.

702
01:12:50,835 --> 01:12:52,970
We can destroy
their fucking labs!

703
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:58,337
We could grab the kid
as a bonus. Kill two birds.

704
01:13:06,169 --> 01:13:08,368
If we do this,

705
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:09,934
our odds of walking
out of here

706
01:13:09,936 --> 01:13:12,200
go down to nearly zero.

707
01:13:12,202 --> 01:13:14,001
If we pull it off,
that walk back's

708
01:13:14,003 --> 01:13:16,101
gonna feel a hell
of a lot sweeter.

709
01:13:16,103 --> 01:13:17,969
And I can lead us
straight there.

710
01:13:21,469 --> 01:13:22,870
Okay.

711
01:13:24,337 --> 01:13:26,069
Tell me while we move.

712
01:14:36,336 --> 01:14:38,801
There's an old drainage
line just east of the church.

713
01:14:38,803 --> 01:14:40,834
The tunnel entrance
is down the slope.

714
01:14:40,836 --> 01:14:42,734
- Right.
- And over here is the church.

715
01:14:42,736 --> 01:14:45,168
Make sure you can
cover that entrance.

716
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:46,633
Here should give you
a good angle

717
01:14:46,635 --> 01:14:48,033
on our bait
and those two buzzsaws.

718
01:14:48,035 --> 01:14:49,599
You got to keep those
from getting wound up.

719
01:14:49,601 --> 01:14:52,267
Be nice to have a friend to
keep any loose Krauts off me.

720
01:14:52,269 --> 01:14:54,203
Yeah, I can cover
him while Boyce sneaks you in.

721
01:14:55,501 --> 01:14:56,567
Okay.

722
01:14:56,569 --> 01:14:57,767
You got to make sure
it feels like

723
01:14:57,769 --> 01:14:59,299
the entire 101st is
laying down on them.

724
01:14:59,301 --> 01:15:01,399
We need to pull as
many outside as we can.

725
01:15:01,401 --> 01:15:03,499
The more they're bunched up
for us, the better.

726
01:15:03,501 --> 01:15:06,169
- I'll take care of that.
- And be careful.

727
01:15:09,369 --> 01:15:12,101
Gonna catch on at some
point it's just two guys.

728
01:15:12,103 --> 01:15:14,766
Just buy us enough time down
below to get the ordnance set.

729
01:15:14,768 --> 01:15:16,633
Then we'll rescue the kid.

730
01:15:16,635 --> 01:15:19,300
- I think we can manage that.
- Yeah.

731
01:15:19,302 --> 01:15:21,299
Good luck.

732
01:15:21,301 --> 01:15:22,734
You keep your head down.

733
01:15:22,736 --> 01:15:24,170
- You too, Ed.
- Yeah.

734
01:15:25,102 --> 01:15:26,104
Hey.

735
01:15:27,835 --> 01:15:29,033
Woulda made a hell
of a chapter

736
01:15:29,035 --> 01:15:30,667
in Dawson's book, huh?

737
01:18:21,401 --> 01:18:23,435
- Reloading!
- Hurry up, Rosenfeld, I need you!

738
01:18:25,235 --> 01:18:26,303
Shit!

739
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,502
Come on, you fucker!

740
01:18:29,936 --> 01:18:31,736
Door! Get the door!
Get the door!

741
01:18:35,569 --> 01:18:38,167
Sounds like the package
did its job.

742
01:18:38,169 --> 01:18:40,637
Hopefully those two
can pull the rest away.

743
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:01,300
Don't stop shooting.

744
01:19:01,302 --> 01:19:03,603
It's a two-person gun,
you bastard!

745
01:19:04,669 --> 01:19:06,535
Shit! Goddamn it!

746
01:19:08,969 --> 01:19:10,399
Let's move.

747
01:19:10,401 --> 01:19:11,470
Move!

748
01:19:18,602 --> 01:19:20,567
Okay, where now?

749
01:19:20,569 --> 01:19:22,100
I think the tower room
is down this way.

750
01:19:22,102 --> 01:19:23,566
What about Paul?

751
01:19:23,568 --> 01:19:26,200
We rig this place,
then we find your brother.

752
01:19:26,202 --> 01:19:28,434
Listen, we'll find him.
Don't worry.

753
01:19:28,436 --> 01:19:30,800
No. I don't have time
for that.

754
01:19:30,802 --> 01:19:32,269
Chloe. Chloe!

755
01:19:33,134 --> 01:19:35,302
She was never gonna wait.

756
01:20:35,768 --> 01:20:38,499
Boyce, go get started
on those labs that you saw.

757
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:40,500
Boats on the beach
in 20 minutes.

758
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,232
I'm setting these timers
for 18.

759
01:20:42,234 --> 01:20:44,570
Anybody still down here after
that is not making it out.

760
01:20:44,935 --> 01:20:46,136
Go.

761
01:21:07,967 --> 01:21:09,169
Paul?

762
01:21:19,835 --> 01:21:20,837
Paul?

763
01:21:25,902 --> 01:21:27,633
He said Paul was in there.

764
01:21:27,635 --> 01:21:28,836
Hey. Paul's not in there.
Come on!

765
01:21:34,235 --> 01:21:36,066
Come on. Come on!

766
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Tibbet!
- Oh, shit.

767
01:21:59,235 --> 01:22:01,637
Move it! Move that ass! Go!

768
01:22:08,235 --> 01:22:10,302
This is where they had Jacob.

769
01:22:14,034 --> 01:22:15,636
Slow, slow, slow.

770
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:37,133
Paul?

771
01:22:38,769 --> 01:22:40,500
- Paul?
- Chloe!

772
01:22:40,502 --> 01:22:42,369
- Paul?
- Chloe!

773
01:22:51,469 --> 01:22:54,736
Let's go. Let's go!
Hurry and get him up.

774
01:22:57,201 --> 01:22:58,399
Let's go.

775
01:22:58,401 --> 01:23:00,267
- Hurry up and get him out.
- No.

776
01:23:00,269 --> 01:23:03,866
I have to finish this.
I have to finish this!

777
01:23:03,868 --> 01:23:04,936
I'll catch up.

778
01:23:05,736 --> 01:23:07,270
I'll catch up.

779
01:23:09,867 --> 01:23:11,335
Be careful.

780
01:23:13,202 --> 01:23:14,403
Go.

781
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Chloe!
Go, Paul, go!

782
01:26:00,169 --> 01:26:01,702
Hello, Corporal.

783
01:26:56,635 --> 01:26:58,702
I had so hoped

784
01:27:00,002 --> 01:27:01,669
to see you again,

785
01:27:02,934 --> 01:27:04,203
Corporal.

786
01:27:06,968 --> 01:27:09,000
I wanted to thank you...

787
01:27:11,402 --> 01:27:13,536
...for helping me

788
01:27:14,667 --> 01:27:17,168
become the man that I am.

789
01:27:22,335 --> 01:27:24,669
This one, Corporal,

790
01:27:25,469 --> 01:27:27,736
I'm going to win.

791
01:28:27,134 --> 01:28:28,269
Shit.

792
01:28:29,069 --> 01:28:30,270
Cover me!

793
01:28:36,402 --> 01:28:38,132
Get down!

794
01:28:38,134 --> 01:28:39,000
Stay down! Stay down!

795
01:28:39,002 --> 01:28:41,203
What the hell
are you doing, kid?

796
01:28:44,535 --> 01:28:46,866
Hey, you're okay.
You're okay, all right?

797
01:28:46,868 --> 01:28:49,203
What do you think you are,
Stan Musial or something?

798
01:28:51,834 --> 01:28:53,498
All right, look at me.

799
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,233
Hold onto me.

800
01:28:55,235 --> 01:28:56,769
Rosenfeld, go!

801
01:29:01,368 --> 01:29:02,665
Shit.

802
01:29:02,667 --> 01:29:03,933
Rosenfeld!

803
01:29:03,935 --> 01:29:06,232
Somebody's got to put
a fucking leash on this...

804
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Tibbet! Tibbet!
- Paul! Paul!

805
01:29:15,501 --> 01:29:16,702
Chloe!

806
01:29:18,435 --> 01:29:20,033
Come on, buddy.

807
01:29:20,035 --> 01:29:22,933
Is the kid okay?

808
01:29:22,935 --> 01:29:25,199
No more running around
for you, all right, kid?

809
01:29:25,201 --> 01:29:27,403
Chloe, you see Ed or Ford?

810
01:29:44,901 --> 01:29:47,968
I'm afraid I don't have
any of your rope.

811
01:29:50,434 --> 01:29:51,768
But...

812
01:30:16,801 --> 01:30:18,869
Where were we?

813
01:30:19,468 --> 01:30:20,936
Oh, yes.

814
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:32,468
What's behind those walls?

815
01:30:35,501 --> 01:30:36,632
Me.

816
01:30:36,634 --> 01:30:38,203
Fuck you.

817
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:42,300
You know,

818
01:30:42,302 --> 01:30:43,769
Corporal,

819
01:30:44,501 --> 01:30:47,266
all that power in the tar...

820
01:30:48,835 --> 01:30:53,032
...running beneath
French feet for centuries,

821
01:30:53,034 --> 01:30:56,302
it just needed to be refined
by their bodies.

822
01:30:57,234 --> 01:31:00,035
But they lacked
the vision to do it.

823
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,199
I am a god,

824
01:31:08,201 --> 01:31:09,465
Corporal.

825
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:22,035
Germany will have
an invincible army.

826
01:32:27,401 --> 01:32:31,000
This Reich, Hitler's
Thousand-Year Empire,

827
01:32:31,002 --> 01:32:33,402
is going to
take over the world.

828
01:32:55,901 --> 01:32:58,368
You like her, sweet Chloe?

829
01:32:59,934 --> 01:33:02,168
I'll tell her goodbye for you.

830
01:33:46,635 --> 01:33:48,533
How does it feel,

831
01:33:48,535 --> 01:33:52,136
the blood of eternity
flowing through your veins?

832
01:33:55,034 --> 01:33:58,100
Not so fucking great.

833
01:34:52,334 --> 01:34:53,335
Boyce.

834
01:35:19,267 --> 01:35:20,269
Ford.

835
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,402
Okay.

836
01:35:31,067 --> 01:35:33,332
Let's get you up. Come on.

837
01:35:33,334 --> 01:35:35,199
- We got to move.
- I'm good.

838
01:35:35,201 --> 01:35:37,669
- You're good?
- I'm good, I'm good.

839
01:35:40,434 --> 01:35:42,965
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Ford!

840
01:35:42,967 --> 01:35:44,032
No, Ford, open the gate!

841
01:35:44,034 --> 01:35:45,899
Listen to me.
Look at me. Ford. Hey.

842
01:35:45,901 --> 01:35:47,031
Ford, look at me.

843
01:35:49,267 --> 01:35:50,334
Ford.

844
01:35:51,534 --> 01:35:52,766
Open the gate.

845
01:35:52,768 --> 01:35:54,198
Open the gate,
we can fix it.

846
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:58,733
I didn't get the timer set
at the tower.

847
01:35:58,735 --> 01:36:01,333
- You got to go take it down.
- I'll take it down, okay.

848
01:36:01,335 --> 01:36:03,065
You just need
to open the gate.

849
01:36:03,067 --> 01:36:05,165
Ford.

850
01:36:05,167 --> 01:36:07,302
Ford, look at me.
Please open the gate.

851
01:36:12,168 --> 01:36:13,636
Open the gate!

852
01:36:17,168 --> 01:36:19,569
I was never getting back.

853
01:36:21,767 --> 01:36:23,566
And this shit,

854
01:36:23,568 --> 01:36:26,102
our side shouldn't
have it either.

855
01:36:28,167 --> 01:36:32,034
It'll have to stay buried
down here with me.

856
01:36:33,168 --> 01:36:36,299
You got to finish
the job, Boyce,

857
01:36:36,301 --> 01:36:38,632
and blow this
whole fucking place up.

858
01:36:42,268 --> 01:36:43,533
Go!

859
01:36:43,535 --> 01:36:44,999
Ford, open the gate.

860
01:36:45,001 --> 01:36:47,669
Ford, please!
There's still time! Ford!

861
01:36:51,668 --> 01:36:53,534
Open the gate!

862
01:36:54,801 --> 01:36:56,601
Ford! Ford, come on!

863
01:36:58,001 --> 01:37:00,669
The tower, Private Boyce.

864
01:37:15,901 --> 01:37:17,835
I think I'm done with this.

865
01:37:20,368 --> 01:37:21,469
Thanks.

866
01:38:47,535 --> 01:38:51,301
<i>Under the command
of General Eisenhower,</i>

867
01:38:51,933 --> 01:38:54,665

01:39:05,335 --> 01:39:08,799
<i>This communique

872
01:39:08,801 --> 01:39:10,365
<i>This is a momentous hour</i>

873
01:39:10,367 --> 01:39:11,800
<i>in world history.</i>

874
01:39:11,802 --> 01:39:15,198
<i>This is the invasion

875
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,732
<i>The zero hour

876
01:39:17,734 --> 01:39:19,999
<i>The men of General
Dwight Eisenhower</i>

877

their landing barges,</i>

878

880
01:39:25,801 --> 01:39:27,266
Yeah, Boyce!

881
01:39:27,268 --> 01:39:29,366
<i>They are moving in from
the sea to attack the enemy</i>

882
01:39:29,368 --> 01:39:31,533

883
01:39:31,535 --> 01:39:33,865

886

<i>but a large proportion
of this assault</i>

887
01:39:39,901 --> 01:39:43,299
<i>is believed to be in the hands

888
01:39:43,301 --> 01:39:45,399
<i>They unleashed the attack

889
01:39:45,401 --> 01:39:47,002
<i>with the British Tommies...</i>

890
01:39:57,335 --> 01:39:58,602
Ford?

891
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:19,665
You had plenty of explosive to
take the tower out above ground,

892
01:40:19,667 --> 01:40:21,931
but you went below
to set the charges.

893
01:40:21,933 --> 01:40:23,732
Yes, sir.

894
01:40:23,734 --> 01:40:26,466
Why would you do something
like that, Private?

895
01:40:26,468 --> 01:40:29,298
Corporal Ford thought
it was best.

896
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:32,831
The number of
enemy troops, he...

897
01:40:32,833 --> 01:40:36,502
He didn't feel we'd be able to hold
them off long enough outside, sir.

898
01:40:37,767 --> 01:40:40,964
Well, your corporal
made a hell of a good call.

899
01:40:40,966 --> 01:40:43,432
I just wish he were here
for me to tell him that.

900
01:40:43,434 --> 01:40:44,764
So do I, sir.

901
01:40:44,766 --> 01:40:45,732
Go catch a breath.

902
01:40:45,734 --> 01:40:47,469
We're gonna fold you
into Charlie Company.

903
01:40:48,468 --> 01:40:49,801
At ease, Private.

904
01:40:53,168 --> 01:40:54,569
Oh, Private?

905
01:40:59,568 --> 01:41:02,232
Did you see anything else
when you were down there?

906
01:41:02,234 --> 01:41:05,834
There's talk about
some kind of Kraut lab.

907
01:41:06,601 --> 01:41:07,898
So if there's anything
down there

908
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:10,801
that's worth us digging
through all that rubble,

909
01:41:11,867 --> 01:41:13,467
you'd let us know, right?

910
01:41:16,534 --> 01:41:18,602
Just the tower control room.

911
01:41:19,734 --> 01:41:22,002
But there's nothing
left of that, sir.

912
01:41:24,866 --> 01:41:26,266
That's what I figured.

913
01:41:26,268 --> 01:41:28,466
Good job, soldier.
You and your squad.

914
01:41:28,468 --> 01:41:29,935
Thank you, sir.

915
01:41:32,367 --> 01:41:33,498
No wilds.

916
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,633
Matchsticks, five.
Buttons, ten.

917
01:41:35,635 --> 01:41:38,865
Are you ready? Ante up.
Including you, kid.

918
01:41:41,401 --> 01:41:44,333
He throws two,
and I calls me that...

919
01:41:44,335 --> 01:41:45,798
Finally got yourself a friend.

920
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:46,665
Hey!

921
01:41:46,667 --> 01:41:48,502
Kid's bugging the hell
out of me.

922
01:41:50,866 --> 01:41:52,299
All right. Two to you.

923
01:41:52,301 --> 01:41:53,832
- You look better.
- Thanks.

924
01:41:53,834 --> 01:41:55,298
Now I just got to
convince somebody

925
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:56,932
how I helped save the war.

926
01:41:56,934 --> 01:41:59,899
Save the war?
All I saw was you missing

927
01:41:59,901 --> 01:42:01,699
a bunch of Germans
with a machine gun.

928
01:42:01,701 --> 01:42:03,565
Are you kidding?
I saved your ass out there.

929
01:42:03,567 --> 01:42:05,498
Is that what happened?
I don't remember that.

930
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:06,934
Do you remember that?

931
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,265
No? That's what I thought.

932
01:42:09,267 --> 01:42:10,366
Did you get your orders?

933
01:42:10,368 --> 01:42:11,699
Yeah, they're putting us
in C Company.

934
01:42:11,701 --> 01:42:13,898
Jesus Christ,
after all that?

935
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:15,901
I thought they would just
send us the fuck home.

936
01:42:16,901 --> 01:42:17,899
Got a job to finish.

937
01:42:17,901 --> 01:42:20,168
We got to get
Tibbet to Hitler.

938
01:42:21,767 --> 01:42:23,198
And then pop!

939
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,667
We all go home.

940
