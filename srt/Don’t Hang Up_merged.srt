All right, fine.

172
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:26,192
One beer and a movie all right,
but I'm not doing prank calls.

173
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,394
Last time we did that shit...
Was amaze-balls!

174
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,863
And when Prank Monkey gets here,
you're gonna shut the fuck up.

175
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,932
Whoa, hold on! What happened to
just you and me?

176
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,333
When you've Prank Monkey 69
in the house.

177
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,068
Dude is a genius at this.

178
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,637
Dude, you cannot be inviting
people over, all right?

179
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,105
If my parents...

180
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,906
Your parents are too busy
banging each other...

181
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,675
in some cheap hotel room, to
care what you're doing tonight.

182
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,377
Okay, thanks. Thanks for the
image, you sick fuck!

183
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,679
Do you think your mom
blows your dad?

184
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,948
She seems like a giver to me.
You are in for it!

185
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:52,818
Oh, Mrs Fuller! Oh, your
titties are so huge!

186
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,655
Agh! Ha-ha!

187
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,990
Turn it off.

188
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,692
Besides, Prank Monkey probably
won't even show.

189
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,293
Little fucker hasn't texted me
back all day.

190
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,995
Please do not be inviting
anyone else...

191
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,363
and forget about making
prank calls, all right...

192
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,033
that shit is absolutely not
happening.

193
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,734
What's that guy's name
across the street?

194
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,269
The one whose dog craps
on your lawn all the time?

195
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,872
No, dude, not on my street.
Dude, he deserves it.

196
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,140
Besides you need a reaction
shot.

197
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,061
You wanna see him freak out,
right?

198
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,278

Well, you had to order
from Peyton?

214

When she finds out it's a prank
from right across the street...

215
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,314
she's gonna know it was me.

216

proven guilty?

217
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,317
I am guilty.

Was your wife Brenda?

224
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,401
But last night was so much fun.

225
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,103
Why are you pretending
not to know me?

226
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,805
Is it the wife? Is she there?
Lemme talk to her.

227
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,440

the next step.

lining?
