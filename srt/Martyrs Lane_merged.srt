00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

3
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:29,731
Rich!

4
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:34,388
Fixed! Fixed!

5
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,030
And here I am, wide awake.

6
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:50,597
And that's it,
then, for the night.

7
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:53,600
What's that? Five hours,
and I'm just so tired.

8
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,428
We don't have enough bamboo
cakes for the poor table.

9
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:56,995
Do you have some more?

10
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,606
The poor table needs cleaning.

11
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,348
Sarah, do you think Thomas
would give me a blessing, Sarah?

12
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:04,785
It always helps me so
much with my sleeping.

13
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:06,483
- Could you ask him for me?
- Of course.

14
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:07,832
Of course, Edith. I'll ask
him as soon as I see him.

15
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:09,399
Thank you.

16
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:10,661
Oh, Janet, could you take
the lamb out of the oven

17
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:12,532
for the rich table?
Just let it rest.

18
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:14,621
But keep it in the
foil, all right?

19
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:16,299
Go set the poor table, quickly/.

20
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:20,497
Leah, I made you a cake.

21
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,020
Here.

22
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:24,414
Now, here we go.

23
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:28,069
Now, you take it home. Don't
let the parish gobble it.

24
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:30,357
Come on. I'll hide it.

25
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,860
You will remember to ask
Father Thomas, Sarah?

26
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:38,645
It's just that I don't want
to bother him at lunch.

27
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,299
I will, Edith. Don't worry.

28
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,083
I'll ask him this evening.
Can you hand me the rice?

29
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:44,153
Oh, yes.

30
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Aah!

31
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,262
Here you go.

32
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:30,828
Nah.

33
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:32,375
Go on.

34
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:38,705
Hey, Leah.

35
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,359
Tell Brian what your
rabbit's called.

36
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:42,666
- No.
- Yeah, tell me.

37
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,582
It's Mary, and
why is that, Leah?

38
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:47,366
You know why.

39
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,934
So, Mary was
visited by an angel,

40
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,328
and now she's pregnant.

41
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,634
Go on, Leah. Tell him.

42
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:57,071
Yeah, tell me.

43
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:58,706
Hey, where you going?

44
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:03,188
Bex, come play with me.

45
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,088
Hey, Leah.

46
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:16,613
Two Truths, One Lie.

47
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:19,006
Your asthma is all in your head.

48
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,878
God loves you.

49
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:23,165
And you're an
attention-seeking little brat.

50
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:31,628
I feel sorry for you
for being so hateful!

51
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,871
Ah!

52
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,155
Stop it!

53
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:39,094
Girls!

54
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:43,857
She's supposed to...

55
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,946
She's just supposed to
help me with that sort,

56
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,079
but I haven't seen
her for weeks now,

57
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:50,777
I'm sure we can Thomas
to make some phone calls.

58
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,736
We'll sort it all
out, Janet. I promise.

59
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,172
She's gonna leave
the house to him,

60
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:55,521
and she hasn't seen
him for five years.

61
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:57,697
You don't know that.

62
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:59,699
Where did you get that?

63
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:01,309
Lillian baked a cake.

64
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,182
Well, you can't have
cake before your dinner.

65
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:06,643
- Put it back.
- Oh, Janet, tough time?

66
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:11,082
Go and do your homework and
wash your hair for tomorrow.

67
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:17,560
Want to play the Stanford?

68
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:19,716
I need to practice. Can
you do the right hand?

69
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,680
One, two, three.

70
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,688
Sorry.

71
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:00,583
It's all right.

72
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:04,935
Ah. Time for dinner.

73
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:20,342
Come on, downstairs.

74
00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:14,807
No, don't!

75
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No, don't, don't!
- Don't, don't!
- Shhh!
Shh.
It's okay. It's
only just a dream.

76
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:28,758
You're okay.

77
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:38,875
We've got someone coming
to stay with us soon,

78
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,312
someone with a little boy.

79
00:10:41,336 --> 00:10:43,749
Can you find some of your
toys for him to play with?

80
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:46,254
- Okay.
- I brought you this to wear.

81
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:54,455
You didn't wash
your hair, did you?

82
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:55,892
No.

83
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,024
Well, you're gonna
have to wait for me.

84
00:10:57,048 --> 00:10:59,093
I'm having a shower first.

85
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,709
Leah, you have to dry your hair.

86
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,145
I couldn't find a hairbrush.

87
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,842
There's one of my dresser.

88
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:18,781
Come on, hurry.

89
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,350
Eh, call you back
in a couple months.

90
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:48,961
Forget it. We're never gonna
reach the target for the roof.

91
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,485
None of this.

92
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:53,618
Ah.

93
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:55,576
Bishop's late.

94
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,405
Bishop's prerogative.

95
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:01,844
- Don't tell Mom?
- It's just one puff.

96
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:04,498
Three. All right.

97
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:07,588
Come on. One, two, three. Ah!

98
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:09,765
- Whee!
- Ahhhh!

99
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,443
Reach up! Whoo!

100
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:34,006
Oh. Father Thomas.

101
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,227
I ha... I haven't been
sleeping very well.

102
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:39,055
Can I have a blessing?

103
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,360
Of course, Edith.

104
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:42,754
- This way.
- Thank you.

105
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:44,824
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yes.

106
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:24,491
Confirm, oh, Lord, your
servant with your Holy Spirit.

107
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:26,866
Leah Elizabeth.

108
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:33,022
Leah Elizabeth,

109
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:37,615
God has called you by
name and made you his own.

110
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:51,978
Confirm, oh, Lord, your
servant with your Holy Spirit.

111
00:14:58,027 --> 00:14:59,526
Sarah.

112
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,528
My locket.

113
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:05,489
Leah has chosen "All creatures
of Our God and King,"

114
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:08,951
number 263 in your hymn books.

115
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,519
Well, everyone... look, look.

116
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:37,434
No, no, no, I'm sorry,

117
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,652
- I should have said that.
- It's gone.

118
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:41,133
- We'll find it.
- We... how? How?

119
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:42,439
How are we going to find it?

120
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:44,267
The clasp must have come loose.

121
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,617
Someone's taken it.

122
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:47,749
- Sarah.
- I'm telling you.

123
00:15:47,773 --> 00:15:49,925
No one's taken it.

124
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,492
- Look, let's try and find it.
- Where did you last see it?

125
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:54,320
Don't ask me where
I last saw it.

126
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:56,912
- Must be in here somewhere.
- Must have fallen on the floor.

127
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,469
Sarah?

128
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:40,992
What is it?

129
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,994
It's the locket.

130
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:45,562
It's open.

131
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:48,154
I told you, it's the clasp.

132
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:20,142
Sarah?

133
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:24,209
Ah. She's sleeping. Come on.

134
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:26,279
Come back to bed, please.

135
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,691
Your face has gone purple.

136
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,135
You'll pass out and
fall on your head.

137
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:59,984
Come on.

138
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:01,792
Come on, Millie.

139
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,067
Want to go the short cut?

140
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:20,420
Come on, Millie.

141
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,620
We never go this way.

142
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:29,100
Stop whinging.

143
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:31,320
But I didn't know this
was the short cut.

144
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,563
How come we never
go this way, then?

145
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,240
Ghosts.

146
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:39,937
You know Henry VIII?

147
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:42,592
He sent his soldiers to
ransack all the monasteries,

148
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:45,812
and there was a monastery
just down the way.

149
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:48,554
And all the monks took all
they could carry and ran away,

150
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:51,078
but the soldiers, obviously
being on horseback,

151
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:53,820
just chased after them, easy,

152
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:56,151
and cut them down as
they ran. Czzzzzt!

153
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:06,944
Loads of them died around here.

154
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,753
You can still hear them
at night, their screams.

155
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:15,799
I'll tell Dad.

156
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:17,279
Tell Dad what?

157
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:18,976
That you're trying to scare me.

158
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,587
You asked. I told you.

159
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:23,807
I'm not gonna mollycoddle
you like everyone else.

160
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:27,898
No, you just don't
tell the truth!

161
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:29,793
I don't tell the truth?

162
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:34,252
Millie?

163
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:37,018
Millie, the road!

164
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:39,388
Millie!

165
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:41,109
Millie?

166
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:58,099
I can see you.

167
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:05,996
- The ribbon.
- It's stuck in a knot,

168
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,761
I have nails.

169
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,831
You can come to my
house, if you like.

170
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:17,486
I've got a rabbit.

171
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,426
She's pregnant, but she's
never been out of her run.

172
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:31,175
Millie!

173
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:43,773
Don't you dare tell
Mom about this!

174
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:46,123
- Promise!
- I promise!

175
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:49,039
Ow!

176
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:51,674
You're hurting me!

177
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:15,976
Help.

178
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:54,493
Here.

179
00:24:58,105 --> 00:25:00,107
What's the matter?

180
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:06,263
Tell me something.

181
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:07,743
What?

182
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:09,682
Tell me something
that will cheer me up.

183
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:18,144
What's black and white
and red all over?

184
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:19,363
I don't know.

185
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:21,626
A sunburnt nun.

186
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,609
Another one.

187
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:28,372
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

188
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:30,505
- The interrupting cow.
- The interr...

189
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,008
Mooooo!

190
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:38,319
What was it that made you cry?

191
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:43,909
Sometimes I just have
bad things in my head.

192
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:46,869
Bad thoughts.

193
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:49,741
I have bad things
in my head, too.

194
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:53,179
Do you?

195
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:54,746
I'm Leah.

196
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,034
- Leah.
- What's your name?

197
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:02,561
Well, what am I supposed
to call you, dingy?

198
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:07,846
Are you lost?

199
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,916
I can ask my mom and dad.

200
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:13,765
Why not?

201
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:15,637
I just need to warm up.

202
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:17,097
My feet are cold.

203
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:22,276
Shh. Lay down.

204
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,500
Boo!

205
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:55,546
- Aah!
- Ah!

206
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,854
Ah, your feet are freezing!

207
00:26:58,878 --> 00:27:00,551
Do you want to play a game?

208
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:03,946
It's called Two Truths, One Lie.

209
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,731
So, okay, so when I was 5,

210
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:08,380
I once smacked my
teacher on the bottom.

211
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:13,912
When I was really little,
I used to suck my thumb.

212
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:17,089
And last year I
had such high fever

213
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:21,354
that the doctor
said I nearly died.

214
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:23,443
Now you guess.

215
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:27,099
I think...

216
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:29,536
Didn't smack a
teacher on the bum.

217
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,713
And the other two are true.

218
00:27:30,737 --> 00:27:32,191
That's right!

219
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:34,237
She's hit me on the
head with a book once.

220
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:37,003
- Really?
- For looking out the window.

221
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:42,811
Okay, I'll do another one, then.

222
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:47,883
I can fit five custard creams
into my mouth at the same time.

223
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:56,085
My dad nearly drowned
when he was little.

224
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,565
But he says he could
feel his guardian angel

225
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:02,308
lift him up in the river
and guide him to the bank.

226
00:28:02,332 --> 00:28:07,923
And I... I took something
really important by mistake.

227
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:09,489
And now I've lost it.

228
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:12,231
- What was it?
- What did you steal?

229
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:14,190
I didn't steal it.

230
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:16,235
I took it.

231
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,261
I was gonna give it back.

232
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:23,547
Something belonging to my mom.

233
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:27,116
And then she was gonna
find out and I panicked.

234
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,468
And now... I don't
know where it is.

235
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:34,321
Does she know it was you?

236
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:39,258
You're supposed to
be guessing the lie.

237
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:41,739
The custard creams.

238
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:44,133
I could fit four.

239
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:46,159
What are you gonna do now?

240
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:56,319
My turn. So, I knew this dog,

241
00:28:56,343 --> 00:28:57,668
and when it was a puppy,

242
00:28:57,692 --> 00:28:59,888
it ate a whole
tube of toothpaste,

243
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:02,107
and then it pooped it
out, the tube and all.

244
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:03,543
Yuck!

245
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,764
And once I ate a
triple-yolked egg.

246
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:10,289
And what you took,
what you lost,

247
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:12,030
is in the back garden,

248
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:15,362
under the windowsill,
beside the yellow rosebush.

249
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:40,232
What are you doing?

250
00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:41,867
Nothing.

251
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:51,809
Go to bed before Mom hears you.

252
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,290
Before Mom hears you.

253
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:57,230
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

254
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:17,337
Go to sleep.

255
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:53,191
Leah, what are you doing?

256
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:55,435
I was thirsty.

257
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:09,710
Okay, come on.

258
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:11,688
Now, straight to sleep, okay?

259
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:13,540
I don't want you up again.

260
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,180
Hello?

261
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:26,945
Is someone there?

262
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:31,819
Who's there?

263
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:38,149
Edith!

264
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:40,673
What are you doing?

265
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:43,198
I need to speak
to Father Thomas,

266
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:45,156
to get a blessing.

267
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,116
Well, he's... he's giving last
rites to John Hart's mother.

268
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,814
I don't know when
he's going to be back.

269
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:53,512
How long have you been there?

270
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:55,688
I'll get him to come 'round to
you first thing in the morning,

271
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:57,627
- I promise.
- Thank you.

272
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:10,051
I can't believe she was just
sitting in the dark like that.

273
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:12,227
Dad says we need to
share what we have.

274
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:14,881
Yes, I know.

275
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:17,884
But she does have her own house.

276
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:20,975
"Do not neglect show
hospitality to strangers,

277
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,628
for by doing so,

278
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:25,394
some people have shown
hospitality to angels."

279
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:45,825
It's okay.

280
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:48,026
Go to sleep.

281
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

282
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,835
Well, I'm sure Thomas has them
in his study or something. I...

283
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:25,316
Can't reimburse you
for the bills and fuel

284
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,405
without presenting receipts
to the parish council.

285
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:28,885
Yes, I know, Lillian.

286
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:30,234
I wanted to talk to
you about the boiler.

287
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:32,193
- I-I want to arrange...
- Aaah!

288
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:34,151
- Oh. Oh.
- Aah!

289
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:35,500
That's it, that's it.

290
00:35:35,524 --> 00:35:37,415
I've got a first-aid
kit in the car.

291
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:40,462
Actually, Lillian, would you
mind just going to find Thomas?

292
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:41,898
He's at morning song.

293
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:43,508
I'm sure he can help
you with those receipts

294
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:44,641
you're looking for.

295
00:35:44,665 --> 00:35:46,448
Well done.

296
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:50,409
Oh.

297
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:05,337
Thank you.

298
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:28,751
Are you enjoying this banana?

299
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,995
Oh.

300
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:38,587
Mm.

301
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:55,580
The prodigal daughter returns.

302
00:36:55,604 --> 00:36:59,149
- Yeah, all right.
- Ah. No hugs for your dad?

303
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:02,196
I don't want any breakfast.

304
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,396
I'm too tired.

305
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:20,431
Ah. How are the
women in my life?

306
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:22,216
Queuing around the house
to leap into your lap.

307
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,261
Oh, quick, very quick.

308
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,089
You got everything
ready for uni?

309
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:28,657
Uni? Look, Dad... still trying
to get down with the kids.

310
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:31,616
Oh, well, maybe I shouldn't
be doing a 10-hour round trip

311
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,403
on my day off to get you there,
then, if I'm so irrelevant.

312
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:37,100
Please don't feed her

313
00:37:37,124 --> 00:37:39,015
at the table, I've told you,

314
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:41,757
Millie is 91 in dog years.
It's to be expected, really.

315
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:43,454
Thomas, what did I just say?

316
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:45,978
Oh, poor Millie. Ooh.

317
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:48,633
Come on, eat your breakfast.

318
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:51,332
I'm hoping for a triple yolk.

319
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:53,595
Have you ever had a triple yolk?

320
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:55,249
I've not even had a double one.

321
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,774
Mm. She's got a strong
constitution, Miss Millie.

322
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:02,386
Mm. Remember when she ate
all that Swiss chocolate?

323
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,996
Yeah, she vomited it
all up later, though,

324
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,737
- all over the doormat.
- Bex, please.

325
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:07,565
- We're having breakfast.
- And that party when she ate

326
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:08,958
- all the coronation chicken?
- Diarrhea.

327
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:11,047
Bex!

328
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:14,137
I once knew this dog, puppy,
that a whole tube of toothpaste

329
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:16,859
and then pooed it
out, tube and all.

330
00:38:20,254 --> 00:38:21,951
Sorry.

331
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:27,392
Who told you that?

332
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:45,734
Come in.

333
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:47,257
Sarah said it was okay.

334
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:48,954
I hope it's not
too much trouble.

335
00:38:48,978 --> 00:38:50,608
- It's no trouble at all.
- The room's free.

336
00:38:50,632 --> 00:38:52,610
- Stay as long as you need.
- Thank you.

337
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:55,004
- That's what this house is for.
- It's the church's house.

338
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:57,528
As much yours as it is ours.

339
00:38:57,552 --> 00:38:59,641
The room's just up
here on the left.

340
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:04,753
That's a good shot.

341
00:39:04,777 --> 00:39:05,995
Oh, sorry, that...

342
00:39:11,697 --> 00:39:14,415
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry! Sorry.

343
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,069
You could win Wimbledon
with a swing like that.

344
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:19,420
Yeah, but I can't do a backhand.

345
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:21,378
You got to keep the
racket straight.

346
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:24,579
Hey.

347
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:34,348
Stop.

348
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,982
Stop.

349
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:44,512
- Kyla!
- Stop, stop!

350
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:48,690
Come here.

351
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,849
Irreconcilable.

352
00:39:57,873 --> 00:39:59,895
- I-R-R-E...
- Uh-huh.

353
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:02,506
- C-O-N...
- Yes.

354
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:07,511
C-I-O...

355
00:40:07,535 --> 00:40:09,078
"Lable." Label.

356
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:11,472
Oh.

357
00:40:11,496 --> 00:40:14,847
- L-A-B-L-E.
- Yes!

358
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:18,827
Mm. Whoa!

359
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:21,027
That was... That was
the biggest so far.

360
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,096
That one is like the...

361
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,532
That is the same
size as your head.

362
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:32,406
Oh! Sorry.

363
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,388
Okay.

364
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,437
You nearly done?

365
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:41,787
Time for bed?

366
00:42:13,008 --> 00:42:15,509
Which one was it. Your lie?

367
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,882
Which one?

368
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:23,473
I found something else
under the yellow roses.

369
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:25,325
What did you find?

370
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:30,262
What's the matter?

371
00:42:30,286 --> 00:42:31,549
A thing.

372
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:44,494
Your turn.

373
00:42:44,518 --> 00:42:46,322
I like meringues.

374
00:42:46,346 --> 00:42:49,238
Everybody likes meringues.

375
00:42:49,262 --> 00:42:51,414
I hate spaghetti.

376
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:53,285
You don't want to play.

377
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:56,941
Okay, I'm thinking.

378
00:42:56,965 --> 00:42:59,161
My mom wears this cardigan

379
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:02,686
with the top button missing.

380
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:07,169
And she says every time she
tries to sew on a new button,

381
00:43:07,193 --> 00:43:08,953
it falls off.

382
00:43:08,977 --> 00:43:12,087
So she just keep wearing
it without the top button.

383
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:15,351
Spaghetti, obviously.

384
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:16,831
My turn.

385
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:19,050
I can sing the alphabet
song backwards.

386
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:21,879
I used to eat jelly
cubes, the raw cubes,

387
00:43:21,903 --> 00:43:24,012
when I was little.

388
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:27,537
- Oh, you shouldn't.
- They're made of bones.

389
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:28,756
Cow bones.

390
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,496
And what you lost...

391
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,150
It's near the old shed,

392
00:43:32,174 --> 00:43:35,961
behind the back, right
under the window.

393
00:46:14,336 --> 00:46:17,794
Come.

394
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:19,578
Leah?

395
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:21,363
Where are you going?

396
00:46:21,387 --> 00:46:23,017
Taking out the dog,

397
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:25,497
Well, just stay in the
church grounds, okay?

398
00:46:25,521 --> 00:46:26,977
Because of the ghosts?

399
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:28,849
What?

400
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:30,613
Bex said.

401
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:35,203
It's an incense boat,

402
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:37,858
Zach Barnes found it
with his metal detector.

403
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:41,209
Did the monks drop it
when they ran away?

404
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:43,907
We don't know.

405
00:46:43,931 --> 00:46:47,432
But people don't leave their
spirits behind when they die.

406
00:46:47,456 --> 00:46:50,242
Only things, only memories.

407
00:46:51,504 --> 00:46:54,439
- They go to Heaven.
- Mm.

408
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,378
What about Hell?

409
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,273
It's not fire and brimstone.

410
00:47:02,297 --> 00:47:04,406
It's...

411
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,234
It's darkness.

412
00:47:06,258 --> 00:47:09,672
It's the absence of love.

413
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:12,414
God's love is like sunlight,

414
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:16,834
seeks out every shadow,
every place of darkness.

415
00:47:20,228 --> 00:47:22,317
But what if you hide?

416
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:33,652
You know what this music is?

417
00:47:33,676 --> 00:47:37,308
It's called "Non
Móriar Sed Vívam."

418
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:38,962
Do you know what that means?

419
00:47:38,986 --> 00:47:42,642
"I should not die but live."

420
00:49:11,035 --> 00:49:12,403
Knock, knock.

421
00:49:12,427 --> 00:49:14,275
Who's there?

422
00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:15,929
The interrupting tomato.

423
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,172
- The interr...
- Splat!

424
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:27,941
Did you find out?

425
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,420
What?

426
00:49:29,444 --> 00:49:32,186
Which one was the lie.

427
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:46,722
You want me to go?

428
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,702
I thought I kept you company.

429
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:52,487
You do. I just...

430
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:53,991
Thought you liked me.

431
00:49:58,821 --> 00:50:02,497
We can play one
game, if you like.

432
00:50:02,521 --> 00:50:04,523
Okay.

433
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:16,076
You sound like you've
got an infection.

434
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,253
I get infections in my chest.

435
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:21,864
- Is that why you nearly died?
- What?

436
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:23,692
You said the first
time we played

437
00:50:23,716 --> 00:50:25,433
that when you were
little, you got so ill

438
00:50:25,457 --> 00:50:26,825
that you nearly died.

439
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:29,785
I was born early.

440
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:31,550
Why were you born early?

441
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,034
Some babies are.

442
00:50:41,299 --> 00:50:42,798
My turn.

443
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:44,321
I hatepineapple.

444
00:50:44,345 --> 00:50:46,652
You didn't like it
when I did spaghetti.

445
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:50,153
And what you took...

446
00:50:50,177 --> 00:50:52,155
It's on the top
shelf of the dresser

447
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:54,442
in the kitchen.

448
00:50:56,575 --> 00:50:58,248
And these are just
my pretend wings

449
00:50:58,272 --> 00:51:00,990
until my real one grow.

450
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:03,732
They're little stumps
on my back right now.

451
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:07,629
I am actuallyan angel.

452
00:51:14,288 --> 00:51:16,290
Shhh.

453
00:51:22,427 --> 00:51:26,146
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

454
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,539
Shhhh.

455
00:51:28,563 --> 00:51:32,263
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

456
00:51:47,234 --> 00:51:49,018
What's happening?

457
00:51:52,718 --> 00:51:55,088
Don't look.

458
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,983
Don't look!

459
00:52:22,878 --> 00:52:24,856
Warm water coming
from the cold tap.

460
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,336
- Mm.
- That's dangerous.

461
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,251
- All right.
- I've got some money.

462
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:29,992
- Let me give him a call.
- Okay.

463
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:33,561
Just tell Sarah that, um,
hmm, the church arranged it.

464
00:52:33,585 --> 00:52:35,171
Think of it as a long-term loan.

465
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:36,912
I am the way...

466
00:52:36,936 --> 00:52:39,262
- And take the house in Devon.
- You all need a holiday.

467
00:52:39,286 --> 00:52:42,047
- I'm not sure if Sarah...
- Hello, Chris, hi.

468
00:52:42,071 --> 00:52:45,268
Yes. I-I just need
to ask a favor.

469
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:48,445
Hot water coming from the
cold tap in the kitchen.

470
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:51,492
Yes, Thursday's fine.

471
00:52:51,516 --> 00:52:54,625
Um, yes, uh, I'll see
you afternoon day then.

472
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:56,149
Yes, thank you, Chris.

473
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,890
Oh, hello, Becca.

474
00:52:58,914 --> 00:53:02,503
Um, so how are you getting
on with the fuel receipts?

475
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:04,722
The parish council needs
to make payment this month.

476
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:07,880
- Sorry. I meant to check the...
- How's Thursday?

477
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:12,904
I said hello, Rebecca.

478
00:53:12,928 --> 00:53:14,234
- Leah.
- Aah!

479
00:53:17,672 --> 00:53:19,998
Um...

480
00:53:20,022 --> 00:53:22,199
Here.

481
00:53:23,896 --> 00:53:26,353
What are they?

482
00:53:26,377 --> 00:53:28,093
Teeth?

483
00:53:28,117 --> 00:53:29,921
Baby teeth.

484
00:53:29,945 --> 00:53:33,079
The girls'. I'd forgotten
they were there.

485
00:53:50,575 --> 00:53:52,248
He's teething.

486
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:54,163
Didn't sleep well.

487
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:57,016
Grabbing hold of
everything he can chew.

488
00:54:19,821 --> 00:54:21,582
Where did you find it?

489
00:54:21,606 --> 00:54:24,933
In the garden, behind the shed.

490
00:54:24,957 --> 00:54:28,066
What were you doing back there?

491
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,223
Exploring.

492
00:54:35,924 --> 00:54:38,013
Such a long time.

493
00:54:40,015 --> 00:54:42,255
It's been missing.

494
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,846
That's why I sewed it back on.

495
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:50,219
The thread is very pink.

496
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:52,071
I like it, though.

497
00:54:54,203 --> 00:54:56,858
It's a bit loose, but
I can make it tighter.

498
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:04,605
What are you doing rattling
around the house so much?

499
00:55:07,913 --> 00:55:10,544
Will you read with me?

500
00:55:10,568 --> 00:55:12,744
Oh, I haven't
finished the dishes.

501
00:55:15,094 --> 00:55:17,899
It'll have to be
quick, 10 minutes.

502
00:55:17,923 --> 00:55:20,989
- 20.
- 8.

503
00:55:21,013 --> 00:55:23,078
- 15.
- 5.

504
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:25,191
Okay, 10.

505
00:55:36,158 --> 00:55:39,268
"But God knows how to make
the story end just right

506
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:42,097
in the way that's best for us.

507
00:55:42,121 --> 00:55:46,319
'Do you really believe that,
Mother?' Peter asked quietly.

508
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:50,279
'Yes, ' she said, 'I do
believe it almost always,

509
00:55:50,303 --> 00:55:53,306
"except when I'm so sad that
I can't believe anything.'"

510
00:56:02,446 --> 00:56:04,926
- Mom?
- Mm-hmm.

511
00:56:06,493 --> 00:56:09,148
I...

512
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,349
He's choking!

513
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,960
He's choking!

514
00:56:18,984 --> 00:56:21,595
He's okay, he's okay, he's okay.

515
00:56:25,207 --> 00:56:26,644
It's okay. It's okay.

516
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:34,826
It's okay.

517
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:48,397
What's the matter with you?

518
00:57:48,421 --> 00:57:51,182
I'm cold.

519
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:53,402
Everything hurts.

520
00:57:53,426 --> 00:57:55,404
Maybe

521
00:57:55,428 --> 00:57:58,451
maybe I should go
and... I'll be okay!

522
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,215
I just need to warm up.

523
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:18,233
We're friends, aren't we?

524
00:58:25,371 --> 00:58:28,176
I here to help you.

525
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,614
Guardian angel.

526
00:58:31,638 --> 00:58:34,138
So, let's play.

527
00:58:34,162 --> 00:58:35,947
Don't want to.

528
00:58:50,135 --> 00:58:53,462
Do-do, do-do, do-do.

529
00:58:53,486 --> 00:58:56,857
Last time we said it
was supposed to be

530
00:58:56,881 --> 00:58:59,424
two truths, one lie,

531
00:58:59,448 --> 00:59:03,951
but you said... You said
you had angel wings,

532
00:59:03,975 --> 00:59:05,430
real ones growing.

533
00:59:05,454 --> 00:59:08,172
Do you want to see?

534
00:59:08,196 --> 00:59:10,068
Go on, look.

535
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:37,486
What is it?

536
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:47,496
You see? Soon I'll
have real wings.

537
00:59:49,107 --> 00:59:50,345
Play?

538
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:52,913
Please go. I don't want to!

539
00:59:52,937 --> 00:59:55,655
Okay, then. My turn.

540
00:59:55,679 --> 01:00:00,007
In the Bible, Jacob
didn't want to marry Leah.

541
01:00:00,031 --> 01:00:01,946
He was tricked.

542
01:00:04,383 --> 01:00:06,753
Your mother will
never forgive you

543
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:09,388
if you don't find
what you stole.

544
01:00:12,957 --> 01:00:16,284
And what you took,
what you lost,

545
01:00:16,308 --> 01:00:18,591
it's in a hole above
the first branch

546
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,940
of the yew tree in the garden.

547
01:00:19,964 --> 01:00:21,594
Please go!

548
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,117
I'm your guardian
angel, aren't I?

549
01:00:23,141 --> 01:00:25,032
Go!

550
01:00:25,056 --> 01:00:26,381
I don't want you here!

551
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:27,817
Come out!

552
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:31,604
Out! Come out. Come out!

553
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,649
Out! Out! Out!

554
01:00:33,673 --> 01:00:37,653
Leah? Leah, shh.

555
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:40,264
It's okay. It's okay.
It's just a dream.

556
01:00:40,288 --> 01:00:42,789
It's okay. Shhh.

557
01:00:42,813 --> 01:00:44,529
It's okay. It was just a dream.

558
01:00:44,553 --> 01:00:46,575
It was just a
dream. You're okay.

559
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:49,907
Shhh. Let's get you into bed.

560
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:38,643
It's all my fault.

561
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:42,212
I knew... I knew that

562
01:02:42,236 --> 01:02:44,562
she hadn't sewn the
button on properly,

563
01:02:44,586 --> 01:02:46,956
and I was supposed to sew it on.

564
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,653
Look, it must have
just fallen off.

565
01:02:48,677 --> 01:02:51,134
It was an accident. He's
okay. No one's hurt.

566
01:02:51,158 --> 01:02:52,507
No, it's...

567
01:02:54,683 --> 01:02:56,444
Leah?

568
01:02:56,468 --> 01:02:58,818
What happened?

569
01:03:13,137 --> 01:03:14,878
Leah?

570
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:22,252
So, what were you doing?

571
01:03:22,276 --> 01:03:25,062
I just wanted to climb the tree.

572
01:03:28,456 --> 01:03:31,218
I was wondering...

573
01:03:31,242 --> 01:03:34,047
We haven't had a
holiday this summer,

574
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:36,789
Lillian's offered us a
week at her flat in Devon,

575
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:40,096
and I thought we could go.

576
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,056
Would that be good?

577
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,908
Would Mom say yes?

578
01:03:52,611 --> 01:03:55,851
Lillian baked us a cake.

579
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:58,182
Mom threw it away.

580
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:04,318
I'll talk to Mom.

581
01:05:45,202 --> 01:05:46,899
Are you hurting?

582
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,745
I know you're not

583
01:06:10,096 --> 01:06:11,837
my angel.

584
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:17,775
I'd like to have been.

585
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:20,256
We're friends.

586
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,978
Still?

587
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,612
Will you help me?

588
01:06:28,636 --> 01:06:30,875
You need something,

589
01:06:30,899 --> 01:06:32,921
and I need something.

590
01:06:32,945 --> 01:06:34,531
My name.

591
01:06:34,555 --> 01:06:35,774
And then?

592
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:39,996
And then it will be okay.

593
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:47,960
Will you... stop?

594
01:06:50,397 --> 01:06:52,071
A deal?

595
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:54,445
My name for what you've lost?

596
01:06:59,145 --> 01:07:02,255
Let's play.

597
01:07:02,279 --> 01:07:04,126
There's someone...

598
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,737
Someone else your mother
will never forgive,

599
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:10,611
someone she hates even
more than your father,

600
01:07:10,635 --> 01:07:12,724
even more than you.

601
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:27,782
The next time I come here
will be the last time.

602
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:34,678
It's not true.

603
01:07:34,702 --> 01:07:37,812
And what you took,
what you lost,

604
01:07:37,836 --> 01:07:40,249
what you stole

605
01:07:40,273 --> 01:07:45,080
is hidden in the brambles
beside the road sign

606
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:46,690
of Martyrs Lane.

607
01:07:46,714 --> 01:07:48,910
She doesn't hate my father.

608
01:07:48,934 --> 01:07:50,520
She doesn't hate me.

609
01:07:50,544 --> 01:07:51,956
She wishes you had died

610
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,871
and someone else had lived.

611
01:07:53,895 --> 01:07:56,246
No!

612
01:08:31,977 --> 01:08:34,390
Sarah, could you
get these receipts

613
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:36,392
to Lillian this
morning? I-I'm so sorry.

614
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:38,679
We won't have any
expenses for the summer.

615
01:08:41,378 --> 01:08:43,641
Thanks.

616
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:57,742
Oh.

617
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:10,034
Lillian?

618
01:09:10,058 --> 01:09:12,148
- Hello.
- Hello?

619
01:09:15,107 --> 01:09:16,804
Sarah.

620
01:09:19,329 --> 01:09:21,940
Oh. How good of you to come.

621
01:09:24,943 --> 01:09:27,400
Ah. Oh, uh, the fuel receipts.

622
01:09:27,424 --> 01:09:30,011
Perfect. Thank you so much.

623
01:09:30,035 --> 01:09:32,144
I think they'll be
good in this vase.

624
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:36,452
Oh, this is, um... This is
Amy, my daughter-in-law.

625
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:39,151
Um, I'm not sure... I'm
not sure that you've met.

626
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,066
Amy, this is, uh, Sarah.

627
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,807
Hello.

628
01:09:43,831 --> 01:09:46,419
Freddy, do you mind taking
those cases upstairs?

629
01:09:46,443 --> 01:09:48,140
Of course.

630
01:09:54,277 --> 01:09:56,124
Can I... Can I get
you a... a cup of tea

631
01:09:56,148 --> 01:09:59,195
or, um, a glass of water
or... or something?

632
01:10:00,718 --> 01:10:02,198
Mom.

633
01:10:29,964 --> 01:10:31,836
Rest now.

634
01:10:33,881 --> 01:10:37,426
Leah.

635
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:39,341
Don't worry.

636
01:10:39,365 --> 01:10:41,585
Everything's gonna be okay.

637
01:13:10,255 --> 01:13:12,668
What are you doing? Come here.

638
01:13:12,692 --> 01:13:14,390
Oh.

639
01:13:27,881 --> 01:13:29,293
Okay. Breathe in.

640
01:13:29,317 --> 01:13:31,426
Hold.

641
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:34,037
One, two, three.

642
01:13:34,061 --> 01:13:35,648
And breathe out. Breathe in.

643
01:13:35,672 --> 01:13:37,780
Hold.

644
01:13:37,804 --> 01:13:40,740
One, two, three, four, five,

645
01:13:40,764 --> 01:13:43,114
six, seven, eight, breathe out.

646
01:13:46,596 --> 01:13:48,400
Demand that she tells
him never to come.

647
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,053
- Please be...
- 10 years, Sarah!

648
01:13:50,077 --> 01:13:52,447
You've forgiven him
so easily, so easily.

649
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:54,188
You don't know what I've
done or haven't done.

650
01:13:54,212 --> 01:13:55,798
No, I don't, because
you don't tell me.

651
01:13:55,822 --> 01:13:57,409
It's between you and your God.

652
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,933
- He's her son!
- Dare we go there now?

653
01:13:59,957 --> 01:14:01,717
- Ask him to leave his home?
- I want you to do something,

654
01:14:01,741 --> 01:14:03,439
feel something.

655
01:14:12,926 --> 01:14:15,383
Promise me you won't tell?

656
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:17,124
No.

657
01:14:17,148 --> 01:14:20,344
Then I won't tell you.

658
01:14:20,368 --> 01:14:22,936
Okay, I won't tell.

659
01:14:54,098 --> 01:14:55,554
Where did you find these?

660
01:14:55,578 --> 01:14:57,841
- Everywhere.
- How?

661
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:04,563
Look, I'm leaving here tomorrow.

662
01:15:04,587 --> 01:15:06,347
I want you, in the morning,

663
01:15:06,371 --> 01:15:08,480
to dig a hole and
bury all of this,

664
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:12,072
just bury it deep in the ground
and never think about it again.

665
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:16,860
Just look after yourself.

666
01:15:22,126 --> 01:15:24,974
- Bex?
- What?

667
01:15:24,998 --> 01:15:26,565
Have you seen her?

668
01:15:31,048 --> 01:15:34,225
No.

669
01:15:36,227 --> 01:15:38,553
Did you hear what I said?

670
01:15:38,577 --> 01:15:40,686
Give this up.

671
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:43,036
No more, okay?

672
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:46,237
No more. Promise me.

673
01:15:47,281 --> 01:15:49,457
Promise!

674
01:16:07,214 --> 01:16:09,018
What are you doing?

675
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:10,870
Sleeping here tonight.

676
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:14,395
Shut your eyes.

677
01:16:23,535 --> 01:16:26,451
I can't you still
sleep with Mini Mill.

678
01:16:29,367 --> 01:16:31,867
Ow!

679
01:16:31,891 --> 01:16:33,371
Go to sleep.

680
01:17:24,552 --> 01:17:28,358
Ah! I'll be back late tonight.

681
01:17:28,382 --> 01:17:32,014
Look after your
mother, okay? Mwah.

682
01:17:32,038 --> 01:17:35,539
Ah, unbridled
hedonism, here we come.

683
01:17:35,563 --> 01:17:37,237
Yeah, you're dropping me
off outside the campus, Dad.

684
01:17:37,261 --> 01:17:38,673
I know, I know.

685
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:40,066
- Wait.
- Haven't you got Mini Mill?

686
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:41,328
- No.
- I'll get her.

687
01:17:41,352 --> 01:17:44,331
- Leah, no, I...
- Oh, come on.

688
01:17:44,355 --> 01:17:46,618
She'll fight off
all your boyfriends.

689
01:18:14,864 --> 01:18:16,755
Woof, woof. Grr!

690
01:18:16,779 --> 01:18:19,346
Leah. Great, thanks.

691
01:18:48,636 --> 01:18:51,335
Ah!

692
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:34,890
Rachel.

693
01:21:42,985 --> 01:21:44,769
Rachel.

694
01:21:48,251 --> 01:21:50,775
Her name.

695
01:21:53,256 --> 01:21:56,670
I took it... the curl.

696
01:21:56,694 --> 01:21:59,499
I just wanted to
know what it was.

697
01:21:59,523 --> 01:22:02,415
Bex told me it was
better to keep her out.

698
01:22:02,439 --> 01:22:04,983
But I think it's
better to let her in.

699
01:22:05,007 --> 01:22:08,116
No, Leah.

700
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:11,337
No, no! No.

701
01:22:11,361 --> 01:22:12,971
No.

702
01:22:23,112 --> 01:22:24,852
See?

703
01:22:29,466 --> 01:22:31,294
I found it.

704
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:48,200
In the Bible,
Jacob loved Rachel,

705
01:22:48,224 --> 01:22:49,245
not Leah.

706
01:22:49,269 --> 01:22:51,749
Oh, Leah, no.

707
01:22:53,751 --> 01:22:55,753
Will you tell me?

708
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:09,917
We weren't...

709
01:23:09,941 --> 01:23:12,900
We weren't expecting
to have another baby.

710
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:19,753
But when I found out I
was pregnant with you,

711
01:23:19,777 --> 01:23:23,650
I was soexcited, I was so happy.

712
01:23:25,957 --> 01:23:27,654
And then...

713
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:32,094
Then something
terrible happened.

714
01:23:34,835 --> 01:23:37,621
It was such a beautiful day.

715
01:23:40,276 --> 01:23:42,017
It happened just like that.

716
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:47,085
So quickly.

717
01:23:47,109 --> 01:23:48,675
Like a chalk snap.

718
01:23:51,548 --> 01:23:57,548
And then... my
contractions started.

719
01:23:57,815 --> 01:24:02,274
You were coming. Too early.

720
01:24:02,298 --> 01:24:07,192
This... tiny little thing,

721
01:24:07,216 --> 01:24:12,632
covered in blood in my
arms, and I was still

722
01:24:12,656 --> 01:24:15,200
trying to understand how
everything had shifted,

723
01:24:15,224 --> 01:24:19,204
how...

724
01:24:19,228 --> 01:24:23,295
It was like I had
gone through a mirror

725
01:24:23,319 --> 01:24:26,428
into a world where

726
01:24:26,452 --> 01:24:28,715
she was gone and you here.

727
01:24:31,892 --> 01:24:34,765
And I felt like I was
in the wrong place.

728
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:40,814
That I had to come back
somehow, but I couldn't.

729
01:24:43,948 --> 01:24:46,535
Just couldn't function.

730
01:24:46,559 --> 01:24:48,170
Couldn't do anything.

731
01:24:51,825 --> 01:24:53,697
I could see you.

732
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:58,658
I can see how
beautiful you were.

733
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:02,706
But I couldn't feel anything.

734
01:25:11,976 --> 01:25:14,694
She wants you to say it.

735
01:25:14,718 --> 01:25:16,415
You have to say her name.

736
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:20,047
Please, Mom, just say it.

737
01:25:20,071 --> 01:25:23,268
Please, Mom, just say it!

738
01:25:23,292 --> 01:25:25,792
You have to say her name.

739
01:25:25,816 --> 01:25:28,514
Rachel.

740
01:25:31,387 --> 01:25:33,432
I'm so, so sorry.

741
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,938
Will you tell Dad?

742
01:26:04,376 --> 01:26:06,639
I don't think he'll understand.

743
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:14,256
Perhaps we should move.

744
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:19,150
Could Dad get another job?

745
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,827
I think so.

746
01:26:23,482 --> 01:26:25,180
He did before.

747
01:26:27,443 --> 01:26:29,271
But I wanted to stay.

748
01:26:34,624 --> 01:26:36,278
Go to sleep now.

749
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:49,454
Mom?

750
01:28:58,985 --> 01:29:00,247
Mom?

751
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,629
Mom?

752
01:29:14,653 --> 01:29:17,980
Oh, my darling.

753
01:29:18,004 --> 01:29:19,765
I'm cold.

754
01:29:19,789 --> 01:29:21,268
I need you.

755
01:29:22,313 --> 01:29:25,074
Oh.

756
01:29:25,098 --> 01:29:27,555
No!

757
01:29:27,579 --> 01:29:28,687
You can't have her.

758
01:29:28,711 --> 01:29:29,911
Ah!

759
01:29:31,017 --> 01:29:32,473
You can do it.

760
01:29:32,497 --> 01:29:33,779
No!

761
01:29:33,803 --> 01:29:35,737
You need to let her go.

762
01:29:35,761 --> 01:29:38,218
Please, Mom, come with me.

763
01:29:38,242 --> 01:29:39,480
I love you.

764
01:29:39,504 --> 01:29:42,744
Mom. Mom, come here. Mom!

765
01:29:42,768 --> 01:29:46,206
- Mom, don't look at her.
- Don't look at her!

766
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:01,329
Mom!

767
01:30:01,353 --> 01:30:03,243
No!

768
01:30:03,267 --> 01:30:05,463
You have to tell her to go!

769
01:30:05,487 --> 01:30:07,706
Aah!

770
01:30:09,273 --> 01:30:11,318
Mom, make her go!

771
01:31:48,067 --> 01:31:51,201
Leah, time to go.

772
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:04,538
The piano stays
for the time being.

773
01:32:04,562 --> 01:32:09,436
I'm not sure we'll
have room for it.

774
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:57,267
Mom?
