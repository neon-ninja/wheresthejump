00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,042
Captain, where are you?

3
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,542
I'm heading there with my sister's family.

4
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,750
We're almost there, so hang on.

5
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,667
Is this the right way?

6
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,792
I drove through here dozens of times.

7
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,292
All the other roads would be packed with cars.

8
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:41,792
Oh...

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,375
Please give us a ride.

10
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:51,208
I have a little girl. I have a wife too.

11
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,792
Please take us to the port.

12
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,667
I'm begging you...

13
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,167
I wasn't bitten! It's not a bite!

14
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:07,833
If we look dangerous,
at least take our girl. Please.

15
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:09,458
Sir?

16
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:12,375
Please! I'm begging you!

17
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,292
Sir! Please!

18
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:18,875
Jung-seok...

19
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't say anything until we're on the ship!

20
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,792
Can you tell us
why this dreadful virus has spread, Paul?

21
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,625
Well, unfortunately, we don't have much information

22
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,250
other than the fact that it started
out of a bio-factory in South Korea.

23
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:44,042
Uh, it's unclear exactly
how this unidentified virus initially began to spread.

24
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,875
Of course,
sheer pandemonium broke loose in South Korea.

25
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,458
And many people began to believe a rumor

26
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:51,875
that was circulating online

27
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,208
about a safe region somewhere further down south...

28
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:56,708
Busan? Is this the correct pronunciation?

29
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:59,042
That's right. People were evacuated there.

30
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,875
But in the end, no place was truly safe.

31
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,667
But there is an absolute safe place
on the Korean Peninsula.

32
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,708
That's correct.
I believe you're referring to North Korea.

33
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:12,542
Perhaps it's fortunate
that this happened before the reunification!

34
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,875
So it turns out.

35
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:17,833
So how long before the Korean government
lost all control?

36
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:19,458
Just one day.

37
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,125
Please move slowly!

38
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,458
This is Alpha One.

39
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,625
Move on!

40
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,708
Be careful!

41
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:44,708
This is Alpha Two.

42
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,625
We have about 50 civilians waiting for boarding.

43
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:03,875
Uncle.

44
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,792
Are you all right, Dong-hwan?

45
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,208
Yes.

46
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,875
Where's Chul-min?

47
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:14,208
He went to get some relief aid.

48
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:19,292
But shouldn't we have arrived in Japan by now?

49
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,417
I'm sure we're almost there, don't worry.

50
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:24,958
Captain!

51
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,708
What is it?

52
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,750
We're being rerouted to Hong Kong.

53
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,083
Why all of sudden?

54
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:35,917
They're not telling me why.

55
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:39,667
I have to go check something.

56
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,917
Excuse me.

57
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,167
I'll ask about it,
so go and check what's going on.

58
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,250
Yes, sir.

59
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:00,917
Excuse me.

60
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,333
Excuse me.

61
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,042
Uh.

62
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,125
Sir!

63
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Sir!

64
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:44,917
Is it true that we are rerouting to Hong Kong?

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,792
Please return to your seats.

66
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:49,375
We need to understand the situation, sir!

67
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,750
Everyone's getting nervous.

68
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:55,417
Please return to your seat
and await further instructions.

69
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,542
Sir!

70
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:57,667
We have a problem.

71
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,042
We've found an infected person
on the lower deck cabins.

72
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,625
We get ramen too?

73
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,875
Come in. Leave your bag here.

74
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:07,958
It looks good.

75
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,125
Please come in.

76
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,917
- Infected!
- What?

77
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,625
What is it?

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

79
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:13,792
It's okay, I'll be right here.

80
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:17,708
Breathe, Dong-hwan. I'm not going anywhere.

81
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,375
It'll be okay.

82
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,458
Look at me.

83
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,333
I'll be right here with you.

84
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,900
What do I do?

85
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,067
Your uncle's here, Dong-hwan.

86
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:14,442
Sis...

87
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:16,817
- What do we do?
- We have to go.

88
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,233
We have to go now, come on!

89
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,567
- Let's go!
- Your uncle...

90
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:24,400
We have to go!

91
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:26,817
We must leave.

92
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Come on!

93
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:30,775
Sis!

94
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:50,483
Sis! Sis!

95
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:06,025
Honey!

96
00:09:07,357 --> 00:09:08,357
No!

97
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:45,608
There is even a case of infected hosts

98
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:48,567
that were found on the last lifeboats
to leave for Hong Kong.

99
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,317
After that, the neighboring countries

100
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,567
decided to no longer accept any more refugees.

101
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,358
In effect, Korea became completely quarantined.

102
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:58,650
Yes, it's been four years already.

103
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,442
Yes. Four years.

104
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:08,525
Wake him up.

105
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:15,525
Hey! Wake up!

106
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,025
That's enough!

107
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,942
We are not here to fight.

108
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:27,775
The boss wants to see you.

109
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:31,983
Hey!

110
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:07,858
Come on.

111
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,317
What are you doing here?

112
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:18,567
Let's leave.

113
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,650
Let go of me.

114
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:21,317
Hyung!

115
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:22,442
"Hyung."

116
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:26,025
It means "brother," doesn't it?

117
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:27,608
You two brothers? Huh?

118
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:29,025
No, no, no.

119
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:31,317
He is my dead wife's brother.

120
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:32,900
Not brother.

121
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
That sounds like a real tragic story.

122
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:38,983
Have a seat.

123
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,192
I don't know what the hell is it
with you people from the peninsula?

124
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:44,817
You, uh... have an air about you.

125
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,650
You have a lot of sad, sad tales...

126
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:50,067
Let's get down to business.

127
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:53,400
Should I say "your country"
or "the peninsula"?

128
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:56,025
Look, I, I heard a rumor...

129
00:12:56,483 --> 00:12:59,900
There seems to be some people
that are going back down

130
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:03,275
into the peninsula
to make their own fate.

131
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:07,358
Zombies don't give a damn about all
that gold and money,

132
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:10,233
which is just laying around there unguarded.

133
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:12,733
I think it's ingenious.

134
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:13,858
Wow.

135
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,650
You want us to go back in there?

136
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,233
Have you lost your mind?

137
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:21,150
My brother,

138
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,942
my mind is completely sound, thank you.

139
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:26,233
Okay.

140
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:27,858
So...

141
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:31,233
the neighboring countries around the peninsula

142
00:13:31,317 --> 00:13:34,483
are controlling every ship
and plane that crosses the border.

143
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:37,525
How would you get in or out?

144
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,900
It's been done.

145
00:13:40,358 --> 00:13:42,692
You don't need to worry about the coast guard.

146
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:45,150
As long as we keep paying them,

147
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,525
the ships go in, the ships go out.

148
00:13:48,108 --> 00:13:51,650
As a matter of fact, technically,
we had the money and the truck.

149
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,025
Twenty million dollars.

150
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:55,692
Until we went missing halfway here.

151
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:57,025
Where was the last time we...

152
00:13:57,108 --> 00:13:58,358
On the Omok Bridge.

153
00:13:58,483 --> 00:13:59,483
Mok-dong?

154
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:01,567
What?

155
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,108
Look, I don't think it's too difficult.

156
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,775
You just go in at night,

157
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:07,275
you get the truck, come back with the money,

158
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:09,983
and don't worry about those zombies.

159
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:12,733
I hear they are practically blind at night.

160
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:14,358
So...

161
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,317
How much money we get?

162
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,567
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:22,192
Well, that's the question, isn't it?

164
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:23,608
Half.

165
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:27,567
That is, if you come back alive.

166
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:32,358
That's 2.5 million dollars per head.

167
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:34,567
Now listen to me.

168
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:37,525
You have no idea when or even

169
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:42,817
if the government is ever going
to grant you any refugee status,

170
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,192
so you might as well make your own goddamn future.

171
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:47,275
Think!

172
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:02,858
We just have to hop on a boat,
and bring the truck back.

173
00:15:02,942 --> 00:15:04,275
What's so hard about that?

174
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:06,358
It'll only take half a day.

175
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:13,817
Are you nuts? You want to go back there?

176
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:19,692
Then do you want to keep living here,
getting treated like scum?

177
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:27,317
You should have let me die
with my son and wife!

178
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:28,983
Why did you do it?

179
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:33,567
Had I let you die, everyone on
that ship would've died.

180
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,650
Am I wrong?

181
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,317
It was a sensible decision.

182
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:41,983
Sensible decision, my ass.

183
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:44,983
Did you even try?

184
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:48,650
Jung-seok...

185
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:51,733
You're tormented too!

186
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,358
You just gave up!

187
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:02,400
Whatever, forget it.

188
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:03,733
Okay.

189
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:07,608
Well, I'm going to go there,

190
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:11,192
so you can do whatever you want.

191
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:14,358
Let's just not bump into each other.

192
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:16,650
It's hard for both of us.

193
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:18,942
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

194
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:22,275
Aren't they bastards from the peninsula?

195
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,567
- What?
- Where the virus came from!

196
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,192
Should you be letting them in here?

197
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:28,275
Move aside.

198
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:29,442
- Let go of me.
- Stop.

199
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:30,983
Do you even care about the others?

200
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:32,108
Stop it.

201
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,733
Is he infected?

202
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:36,317
Come on. Stop.

203
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:38,358
I won't take your money, so just leave!

204
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:41,108
You go ahead.

205
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,358
You're entering the peninsula waters.

206
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:17,567
Turn back.

207
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,692
You're entering the peninsula waters.

208
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:20,775
Turn back.

209
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:23,608
This is Z055 Chungpyung.

210
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,317
- Hello?
- Hello?

211
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,900
It's all good if there's no response.

212
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:54,525
Almost there!

213
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,733
No need to be so serious.

214
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:01,817
Soon, you'll be rich!

215
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:03,775
Take what you need.

216
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,983
Don't forget, the zombies are blind at night
and sensitive to sound.

217
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:11,233
And the important thing.

218
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:16,817
We'll drop you off
and stay at sea nearby for three days.

219
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:22,442
Take these.

220
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
One for you.

221
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:28,067
And... another.

222
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,400
Call me when you get to the port with the truck

223
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:33,442
and we'll pull up the boat.

224
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:39,317
And lastly!

225
00:18:39,942 --> 00:18:43,442
You escaped out of there alive,
so you know better...

226
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:47,233
Don't screw up trying
to save each other for nothing.

227
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:49,650
Don't worry. We know.

228
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,067
Great!

229
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:52,900
Do not let us down.

230
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:05,733
It makes me nervous that you two know each other.

231
00:19:05,817 --> 00:19:07,192
I know.

232
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:09,983
We have to pull this off no matter what,

233
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,400
so don't let your personal emotions
get mixed up in the way.

234
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:15,733
We won't even see each other after this,
so don't worry.

235
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:18,483
Fine.

236
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,108
Whatever, man.

237
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:52,150
GOD HAS FORSAKEN US

238
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:14,025
We're not on a tour, you know.

239
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:18,150
Let's hurry things along,
we should leave before sunrise.

240
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,567
All right, let's get it over with.

241
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,150
Jeez.

242
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:28,108
Is it working?

243
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,025
Nice!

244
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,233
It's unrecognizable now. My goodness.

245
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:58,608
The city became a ruin in just four years.

246
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:00,650
Did you live near here?

247
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,525
I used to drive a cab.

248
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:07,692
So I pretty much know all the roads.

249
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:11,567
At the very least,
those jerks put together a good team.

250
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,567
A HEALTHY, CAREFREE COUNTRY

251
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:48,733
Could that be it?

252
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:50,150
Where?

253
00:22:51,608 --> 00:22:53,442
The plate number is 6431, right?

254
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:55,233
We'll find out soon.

255
00:22:55,817 --> 00:22:57,733
You stay here, I'll go alone.

256
00:22:57,817 --> 00:22:58,858
What?

257
00:22:58,942 --> 00:23:00,817
Hey, hey, hey! Wait!

258
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

259
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:08,358
Come on, come on, come on!

260
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:10,775
What's with you?

261
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:12,775
Is that the truck?

262
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:14,650
No, it isn't.

263
00:24:16,358 --> 00:24:18,483
It should be nearby.
Let's look around a bit more.

264
00:24:46,358 --> 00:24:48,775
There, I see one more.

265
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,983
Let's check it out.

266
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,400
Okay.

267
00:25:13,317 --> 00:25:17,025
I'll go have a look. You stay here.

268
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:18,108
Stop it!

269
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:19,858
I'm not on a tour, you know.

270
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,775
We'll go together.

271
00:25:22,317 --> 00:25:23,317
Mister.

272
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:25,483
Let's take a look.

273
00:25:46,983 --> 00:25:48,358
Are they Unit 631?

274
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:52,400
No. They're not.

275
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,567
Jackpot, we found it.

276
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:23,317
It was true...

277
00:26:26,692 --> 00:26:28,692
What they said was true.

278
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:30,900
It's all in US dollars. How much is all this?

279
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:33,483
We confirmed it, so let's get going.

280
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:36,567
Okay.

281
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,900
Jeez.

282
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hey! Over here!

283
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:48,817
He must've been the last person to make contact.

284
00:26:51,358 --> 00:26:53,067
How unfortunate.

285
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:55,525
He could've been a millionaire.

286
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,483
But it's good for us.

287
00:26:57,775 --> 00:26:59,233
Let's pull him out and go.

288
00:27:01,692 --> 00:27:03,900
Oh, jeez...

289
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:06,108
He stinks...

290
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:10,275
Move your leg. Thank you.

291
00:27:10,775 --> 00:27:11,817
Thank you.

292
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:23,442
Idiots.

293
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:34,275
Are you okay?

294
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:36,442
I'm fine, I wasn't bitten.

295
00:27:44,692 --> 00:27:47,067
Gosh, what are they up to?

296
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:03,067
Get in the car, go!

297
00:28:05,942 --> 00:28:07,025
Back it up!

298
00:28:58,067 --> 00:28:59,317
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

299
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,442
Come on, come on, come on!

300
00:29:00,525 --> 00:29:01,608
All right!

301
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:04,317
Let's go!

302
00:29:04,317 --> 00:29:05,608
Go! Go!

303
00:29:13,817 --> 00:29:14,983
We're clear, we're clear!

304
00:29:15,192 --> 00:29:16,317
Thank you...

305
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:19,817
So the money's really there?

306
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:22,858
You're a millionaire!

307
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:26,108
Yes!

308
00:29:26,192 --> 00:29:27,817
Awesome!

309
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,525
What will you do with the money?

310
00:29:29,608 --> 00:29:31,067
Me? Uh...

311
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,275
Maybe I'll hire a chauffeur.

312
00:29:32,358 --> 00:29:34,108
Like a real millionaire!

313
00:29:38,025 --> 00:29:40,025
So we just have to get
to the harbor and call them in.

314
00:29:41,483 --> 00:29:43,400
This is a piece of cake!

315
00:29:45,358 --> 00:29:46,567
Give me the satellite phone.

316
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,358
Huh? Sure, hold on.

317
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,150
Here.

318
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:05,817
What's that?

319
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:27,900
Just drive!

320
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:29,900
Go, go, go! Just go!

321
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:17,358
Hop in, if you want to live.

322
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,692
Sorry!

323
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:53,650
You must've been scared.

324
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:58,942
Yu-jin, I told you not
to act so friendly to strangers.

325
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:01,317
Sit back properly.

326
00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:52,900
Dang, he passed out.

327
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:55,567
Did I not tell him to buckle up?

328
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,900
Joon-i, can you drive through them?

329
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:06,067
I'm not sure.

330
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:09,942
Then what? Do I need to get involved?

331
00:35:58,817 --> 00:36:00,025
Ooh...

332
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:01,483
Ooh.

333
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,358
Uh?

334
00:36:21,692 --> 00:36:22,775
Really?

335
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:26,900
The ground was weird, it wasn't my fault.

336
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:29,733
Oh.

337
00:37:01,942 --> 00:37:04,483
I really liked that one, though.

338
00:37:31,608 --> 00:37:33,983
CITY NIGHT CLUB

339
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:18,400
It's a grocery truck. Nice.

340
00:38:19,317 --> 00:38:20,692
It looks new.

341
00:38:25,608 --> 00:38:27,608
- Who's that?
- He's alive!

342
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:32,983
- Please, help me...
- Be careful.

343
00:38:33,192 --> 00:38:36,775
- Be careful.
- Help me, I'm begging you...

344
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:42,400
Help me, please.

345
00:38:42,483 --> 00:38:44,108
What the hell's going on?

346
00:38:44,608 --> 00:38:46,025
He's just an infected, you jerks.

347
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,650
Have you never seen one before?

348
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:49,192
Please...

349
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:51,067
It's all right, come here.

350
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:16,233
Sir, please, help me...

351
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:18,900
I'm begging you...

352
00:39:22,942 --> 00:39:25,025
- Give it to me.
- Here you go!

353
00:39:27,858 --> 00:39:29,233
Sir...

354
00:39:32,442 --> 00:39:33,817
Nice shot!

355
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:35,567
Wow, he killed him properly.

356
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:37,483
Damn it!

357
00:39:39,442 --> 00:39:41,483
It got on my pants. I should get it washed.

358
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,150
Here.

359
00:39:44,317 --> 00:39:45,567
Let's get back, the sun will rise.

360
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:47,108
Shit...

361
00:39:47,483 --> 00:39:49,942
- Let's go.
- The zombies are coming!

362
00:39:52,483 --> 00:39:54,192
Huh?

363
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:16,733
You little rascals!

364
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:20,317
You brought something dangerous instead
of what you were supposed to get.

365
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:21,483
Hey!

366
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:25,608
You'd have been locked up for insubordination
if it were the old days!

367
00:40:32,317 --> 00:40:33,608
Lieutenant Yoon! Captain Hwang!

368
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:34,692
Assemble!

369
00:40:35,192 --> 00:40:36,608
Aren't you going to make a report?

370
00:40:36,692 --> 00:40:38,192
Did you get what I asked?

371
00:40:38,483 --> 00:40:41,150
Salute! Division commander, we did not get it!

372
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:44,108
Hey!

373
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,775
How could you not get it?

374
00:40:45,858 --> 00:40:48,067
The ROK-US Combined Forces Command
is waiting for my call!

375
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,442
Without batteries...

376
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:50,650
Come on!

377
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:52,317
- Are you having fun?
- Joon-i!

378
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:54,400
- Captain Hwang!
- Grandpa!

379
00:40:55,025 --> 00:40:56,942
How long will you go on with that army stuff?

380
00:40:57,025 --> 00:40:58,025
Aren't you sick of it?

381
00:40:58,108 --> 00:40:59,358
No, it's for real this time!

382
00:40:59,442 --> 00:41:02,025
The newly appointed Major Jane
is totally different.

383
00:41:02,108 --> 00:41:03,733
She and I get along.

384
00:41:03,817 --> 00:41:06,775
And it seems like we'll get rescued soon.

385
00:41:06,858 --> 00:41:09,233
Listen to me, I'm good friends with her, so--

386
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:11,275
- Stop it! I'm sick of it!
- Yu-jin, you believe me, right?

387
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:12,358
Who are you?

388
00:41:15,317 --> 00:41:17,692
I guess you've never experienced
a wild dog hunt before.

389
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,275
You should've known that such trucks

390
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:20,942
would attract their attention.

391
00:41:21,275 --> 00:41:22,358
"Truck"?

392
00:41:22,442 --> 00:41:23,775
Who's that?

393
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:24,858
Mom!

394
00:41:30,025 --> 00:41:34,192
Sir! Please!

395
00:41:36,233 --> 00:41:38,900
He was almost caught by Unit 631.

396
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:41,483
You went outside again?

397
00:41:42,108 --> 00:41:43,817
I convinced her to go.

398
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,483
Why don't you ever listen to me?

399
00:41:47,275 --> 00:41:48,442
I'm sorry, Mom.

400
00:41:50,192 --> 00:41:52,775
They're batteries. Grandpa, she got batteries!

401
00:41:54,483 --> 00:41:56,400
Okay! Okay!

402
00:41:59,108 --> 00:42:00,108
They fit.

403
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:02,192
Hi, Jane? Jane? Major Jane?

404
00:42:02,775 --> 00:42:05,317
Oh, Jane! Oh, Jane! Okay!

405
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,358
Are you okay?

406
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,067
- I'm okay! Yeah!
- You should turn it on.

407
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,567
We are strong soldiers! No problem!

408
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,900
I'm Yu-jin!

409
00:42:16,192 --> 00:42:17,275
When are you coming?

410
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:19,608
- So people still live here...
- They said they're coming!

411
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,483
Who are you?

412
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:24,442
Are you with Unit 631?

413
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,442
I don't know what 631 is.

414
00:42:32,275 --> 00:42:34,483
I came to Incheon by boat yesterday.

415
00:42:35,692 --> 00:42:36,858
From Hong Kong.

416
00:42:37,317 --> 00:42:38,317
What?

417
00:42:39,442 --> 00:42:40,900
From where?

418
00:42:52,108 --> 00:42:53,817
Damn, the sun is rising.

419
00:42:55,233 --> 00:42:56,900
Let's hurry up.

420
00:43:02,067 --> 00:43:03,567
The third platoon is returning!

421
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,025
Open the gate!

422
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:17,233
There are one, two, three,
four, five, six boxes of cookies.

423
00:43:17,608 --> 00:43:18,817
That's all correct.

424
00:43:21,192 --> 00:43:22,525
Scrap soup again?

425
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:23,942
Eat if you want to live.

426
00:43:24,025 --> 00:43:27,108
That looks good. Have a great meal!

427
00:43:27,192 --> 00:43:29,150
Have a nice meal. Have a nice meal.

428
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,983
The third platoon is back!

429
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:34,400
They're here!

430
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:48,067
- They're back!
- They're here!

431
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:51,942
Great work, everyone.

432
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:53,692
Look! Isn't it awesome?

433
00:43:53,775 --> 00:43:55,400
- Yeah!
- It sure is.

434
00:43:55,483 --> 00:43:57,108
My boys worked so hard!

435
00:43:57,192 --> 00:43:59,525
Bring us a can of tuna, that's all I ask!

436
00:43:59,608 --> 00:44:00,817
- I'm sorry, sir...
- No, bring one.

437
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,525
We were told to keep a tight lid on supplies.

438
00:44:02,608 --> 00:44:05,067
If I keep handing out stuff,
there won't be anything left.

439
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,358
And Captain Seo is...

440
00:44:06,942 --> 00:44:08,108
One can is too much?

441
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:09,358
That's not it...

442
00:44:09,692 --> 00:44:10,692
Bring it.

443
00:44:10,942 --> 00:44:11,983
They're serving food at the cafeteria.

444
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,067
Get it!

445
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,233
I said bring it!

446
00:44:14,483 --> 00:44:15,900
So I should just have scraps?

447
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,192
That's not...

448
00:44:17,275 --> 00:44:18,275
Do you want it?

449
00:44:18,608 --> 00:44:20,733
I have to report to Captain Seo first.

450
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:22,817
Just bring it, asshole!

451
00:44:24,025 --> 00:44:28,067
Report to a guy who's never even fought before?

452
00:44:28,483 --> 00:44:29,817
He's my commander.

453
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,942
- Sergeant...
- Piss off, you bastard!

454
00:44:33,608 --> 00:44:35,358
- What was that?
- I'm talking here!

455
00:44:35,733 --> 00:44:37,233
- What was that?
- Hello?

456
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,567
- Where is it coming from?
- I heard something.

457
00:44:43,567 --> 00:44:45,025
- What? A person?
- Hang on.

458
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:47,650
Sir, we have a wild dog here.

459
00:44:48,483 --> 00:44:49,483
- What?
- Get him.

460
00:44:49,775 --> 00:44:51,067
What's a wild dog?

461
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,775
Are you soldiers?

462
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,650
Help me, I'm not from here.

463
00:44:58,775 --> 00:44:59,775
Get up, you bastard.

464
00:44:59,858 --> 00:45:01,317
Has the game started?

465
00:45:01,525 --> 00:45:02,567
It hasn't, sir.

466
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,192
Take him to the arena.

467
00:45:04,275 --> 00:45:06,317
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go!

468
00:45:07,692 --> 00:45:09,400
We have a new player!

469
00:45:14,067 --> 00:45:18,483
Keep sucking up to Captain Seo,
and I'll kill you both.

470
00:45:18,567 --> 00:45:19,567
Got that?

471
00:45:21,567 --> 00:45:23,442
You little...

472
00:45:26,483 --> 00:45:27,608
Hey! Hey!

473
00:45:28,608 --> 00:45:30,025
He probably wasted all the flares

474
00:45:30,108 --> 00:45:31,608
without knowing what to get.

475
00:45:32,108 --> 00:45:33,192
That idiot.

476
00:45:33,608 --> 00:45:37,400
He brought so much useless crap last time.

477
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,608
What the hell?

478
00:45:44,025 --> 00:45:45,817
We are strong soldiers!

479
00:45:46,108 --> 00:45:47,400
Strong! Strong!

480
00:45:48,317 --> 00:45:49,567
Strong. Strong.

481
00:45:50,817 --> 00:45:52,942
No one ever came to rescue us in four years,

482
00:45:53,983 --> 00:45:55,650
but some chump change was all it took?

483
00:45:58,567 --> 00:45:59,900
What about your group?

484
00:46:04,775 --> 00:46:05,858
They're all dead.

485
00:46:07,733 --> 00:46:08,817
Everyone.

486
00:46:11,192 --> 00:46:12,400
We got a fresh one!

487
00:46:26,942 --> 00:46:28,317
Hey there, cutie!

488
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,025
Who were those soldiers?

489
00:46:35,108 --> 00:46:36,775
They're called Unit 631.

490
00:46:37,525 --> 00:46:39,775
They used to be a military unit dispatched
to rescue civilians.

491
00:46:40,317 --> 00:46:42,233
You were with them?

492
00:46:42,317 --> 00:46:44,692
We lived there before we escaped.

493
00:46:44,775 --> 00:46:46,275
At first.

494
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:49,567
They sent out SOS signals for a few years,

495
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:50,775
which were left unanswered.

496
00:46:51,983 --> 00:46:53,942
After that, they gave up everything,

497
00:46:54,067 --> 00:46:56,150
and now they're all crazy.

498
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,483
Hm.

499
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:35,442
I'm leaving.

500
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:45,608
Yes?

501
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,108
Bang!

502
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:01,733
Awesome, that's great.

503
00:48:05,858 --> 00:48:08,233
I'm not someone who takes bribes, take it back.

504
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:10,275
Gosh, you're making me sad.

505
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:12,400
I don't take bribes!

506
00:48:12,483 --> 00:48:13,817
Look at it, it's Black Label.

507
00:48:14,942 --> 00:48:17,608
Thanks, I was finishing my last drink.

508
00:48:18,525 --> 00:48:21,025
Here, accept my drink.

509
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:30,692
Nothing to report again?

510
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:32,317
No, nothing happened.

511
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,400
Sergeant Hwang stole a truck
from wild dogs overnight,

512
00:48:37,942 --> 00:48:41,233
and was boasting like crazy,

513
00:48:41,317 --> 00:48:43,317
acting all high and mighty...

514
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:47,358
So where did our valiant sergeant go today

515
00:48:47,442 --> 00:48:49,983
and what adventure did he have?

516
00:48:52,108 --> 00:48:53,650
What did he bring in?

517
00:48:54,525 --> 00:48:57,275
Captain, that's the weird thing.

518
00:48:57,733 --> 00:48:59,400
The truck was full of US dollars.

519
00:48:59,483 --> 00:49:00,608
US dollars?

520
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,650
How much?

521
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:05,775
It was quite a bit.

522
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:09,233
About 20 bags full of them.

523
00:49:09,817 --> 00:49:12,858
But why do you think those idiotic wild dogs

524
00:49:12,942 --> 00:49:16,108
were transporting completely useless money?

525
00:49:18,858 --> 00:49:20,108
Where is it now?

526
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,150
So they took the truck.

527
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,150
What about the satellite phone?

528
00:49:25,942 --> 00:49:27,983
It should be by the driver's seat.

529
00:49:36,442 --> 00:49:39,483
Sir, I'm not from here!

530
00:49:40,692 --> 00:49:42,775
I'm from Hong Kong!

531
00:49:44,692 --> 00:49:45,775
This is brand new.

532
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,650
It's rare. Today is your lucky day.

533
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:48,942
Got anything else?

534
00:49:49,192 --> 00:49:51,900
I have... a satellite phone!

535
00:49:53,275 --> 00:49:56,567
With a satellite phone,
we can all get out of here!

536
00:49:57,483 --> 00:49:59,025
- Show us!
- Right here!

537
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,733
- You lying sack of shit!
- He doesn't have it!

538
00:50:06,817 --> 00:50:09,317
Where do you think they
were heading with this money?

539
00:50:16,608 --> 00:50:18,317
Sir, where's the truck?

540
00:50:19,567 --> 00:50:20,900
Stop that!

541
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:22,483
Stop! Please!

542
00:50:24,525 --> 00:50:26,067
Ah...

543
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,233
He's really fresh!

544
00:50:35,317 --> 00:50:38,400
This guy's in good shape. He's a Grade A!

545
00:50:41,942 --> 00:50:43,067
Can you run well?

546
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:44,650
No?

547
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:49,025
What should his number be?

548
00:50:49,108 --> 00:50:50,400
Give him Park Chan-ho's number.

549
00:50:50,483 --> 00:50:51,483
Number 61!

550
00:50:51,567 --> 00:50:52,900
Number 61 it is!

551
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:56,942
Major League pitcher!

552
00:50:57,608 --> 00:50:58,733
That's a great number!

553
00:51:03,608 --> 00:51:04,733
Turn around!

554
00:51:07,692 --> 00:51:10,067
I'm betting a chocolate bar on him.

555
00:51:15,233 --> 00:51:17,317
Sir, where's the truck?

556
00:51:29,275 --> 00:51:32,567
Sir! I'm not from here!

557
00:51:33,192 --> 00:51:35,150
There's money in the truck! Go check it out!

558
00:51:35,233 --> 00:51:38,108
We can all leave if we have that, you idiots!

559
00:51:59,108 --> 00:52:00,108
What...

560
00:52:05,275 --> 00:52:06,317
Hello?

561
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,900
Where are you? The sun is out.

562
00:52:08,317 --> 00:52:09,442
What's going on?

563
00:52:10,775 --> 00:52:12,942
Hello. Who are you?

564
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:14,233
What?

565
00:52:14,317 --> 00:52:15,608
Who the hell are you?

566
00:52:15,775 --> 00:52:17,025
Where's the money?

567
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:44,567
Where are you going?

568
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:46,983
I don't think we should go out...

569
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,733
Number 61! Get out!

570
00:52:54,483 --> 00:52:55,650
Get the hell out!

571
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:30,567
I don't care who you are.

572
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:31,650
Just bring the money.

573
00:53:31,733 --> 00:53:34,025
The terms are the same
as the guys we sent in...

574
00:53:34,275 --> 00:53:37,442
Half the money to anyone
that brings it out. Okay?

575
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:41,525
Are you saying we can get out of here?

576
00:53:41,608 --> 00:53:43,483
We are waiting around Incheon Port.

577
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:45,108
You call me when you get there.

578
00:53:45,775 --> 00:53:46,817
It's so easy!

579
00:53:47,608 --> 00:53:49,858
Easy, easy. I can do it. I can do it.

580
00:53:49,942 --> 00:53:50,983
All right.

581
00:53:58,483 --> 00:53:59,983
You can drive, right?

582
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,150
Let's just go now, Mom.

583
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:06,108
I'll bulldoze them all with my car.

584
00:54:08,733 --> 00:54:11,608
You'll just go in there? In broad daylight?

585
00:55:26,442 --> 00:55:28,692
Run faster!

586
00:55:48,233 --> 00:55:52,233
It's time for us. To say goodbye

587
00:55:52,608 --> 00:55:55,067
Let's meet again soon

588
00:55:56,567 --> 00:56:00,567
It's time for us. To say goodbye

589
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,483
Let's meet again soon

590
00:56:06,192 --> 00:56:07,400
Hey, buddy!

591
00:56:08,608 --> 00:56:10,233
If you don't hurry, the doors will shut!

592
00:56:37,483 --> 00:56:38,733
You must be tired.

593
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,150
You did great.

594
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:41,608
How about a feast?

595
00:56:41,817 --> 00:56:43,233
You want it? Really?

596
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:46,025
Have some ramen!

597
00:56:46,442 --> 00:56:48,692
Eat slowly! Share them with your friends!

598
00:56:48,775 --> 00:56:50,067
Greedy bastards.

599
00:56:55,275 --> 00:56:56,400
You should share them!

600
00:56:58,358 --> 00:57:01,650
It's too dangerous now.
Let's move after sundown.

601
00:57:01,733 --> 00:57:04,400
I think we can go now, though...

602
00:57:05,275 --> 00:57:06,858
Go? Go where?

603
00:57:08,233 --> 00:57:10,650
Grandpa, we're moving. Let's pack up.

604
00:57:10,942 --> 00:57:11,983
Move?

605
00:57:12,525 --> 00:57:13,525
Where?

606
00:57:13,608 --> 00:57:15,317
We're going to Incheon Port.

607
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,025
Incheon Port? Are we going to ride a boat?

608
00:57:17,108 --> 00:57:18,108
Okay!

609
00:57:18,192 --> 00:57:19,317
No, no, no!

610
00:57:19,733 --> 00:57:23,108
We must stay here until Jane
comes to rescue us.

611
00:57:23,192 --> 00:57:24,983
It was so hard convincing her!

612
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:27,733
If Major Jane is coming,
tell her to come to the port.

613
00:57:27,817 --> 00:57:29,150
No way!

614
00:57:29,233 --> 00:57:30,608
You said you two are close.

615
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,942
I guess you aren't.

616
00:57:33,733 --> 00:57:34,733
We're close.

617
00:57:34,942 --> 00:57:36,733
Okay, it's doable.

618
00:57:37,483 --> 00:57:38,942
Incheon? Incheon Port?

619
00:57:39,025 --> 00:57:41,108
- Grandpa, hurry!
- Okay.

620
00:57:43,692 --> 00:57:46,483
You'll take a crazy old man and little kids

621
00:57:48,067 --> 00:57:50,525
to steal a truck from armed soldiers?

622
00:57:51,525 --> 00:57:54,608
Then should I continue living here with my girls?

623
00:57:55,983 --> 00:57:57,858
If you're scared, stay here.

624
00:57:59,525 --> 00:58:01,067
I'll give you this place at a cheap price.

625
00:58:03,442 --> 00:58:05,150
Get him a first aid kit,

626
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,108
and get some sleep. We'll leave after sundown.

627
00:58:27,817 --> 00:58:29,358
Why did you save me earlier?

628
00:58:30,692 --> 00:58:33,150
I was going to leave, but she wanted to save you.

629
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:37,942
Dad told us we should help the weak
before he went to heaven.

630
00:58:39,108 --> 00:58:40,983
You looked weak.

631
00:58:43,233 --> 00:58:45,192
Stop yapping and go to bed.

632
00:58:45,275 --> 00:58:46,275
No!

633
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:48,275
I'm going to bed soon too, so go to sleep!

634
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,483
I don't want to!

635
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,608
One! Two!

636
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:54,192
She's always like that...

637
00:58:54,275 --> 00:58:55,817
She thinks she's so big now.

638
00:58:57,483 --> 00:58:59,067
Maybe we should've left you there.

639
00:58:59,692 --> 00:59:01,400
You're complaining when we saved you.

640
00:59:02,483 --> 00:59:03,942
You look like a zombie.

641
00:59:09,983 --> 00:59:12,317
Mm...

642
00:59:13,567 --> 00:59:15,650
How long does it take to get to Incheon Port?

643
00:59:15,733 --> 00:59:17,025
If we find an unobstructed route,

644
00:59:17,108 --> 00:59:18,483
it'll only take thirty minutes.

645
00:59:18,817 --> 00:59:20,775
Thirty minutes, thirty minutes, thirty minutes...

646
00:59:21,733 --> 00:59:23,275
What about zombies? Wouldn't it be dangerous?

647
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:24,525
They bite and stuff.

648
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:25,775
- Captain.
- Yes?

649
00:59:26,483 --> 00:59:28,275
We need to get out of here.

650
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,275
Forget about the zombies!

651
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,942
Should we bring Sergeant Hwang?

652
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:36,192
He's more dangerous than the zombies.

653
00:59:36,275 --> 00:59:37,275
You're right.

654
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:39,900
I can keep the gatekeepers off our backs,

655
00:59:40,483 --> 00:59:44,025
but sharp-witted Sergeant Hwang
might get suspicious.

656
00:59:45,942 --> 00:59:47,775
Yes, you're right.

657
00:59:48,817 --> 00:59:54,817
Then I just have to find a way
to distract him, right?

658
01:00:36,525 --> 01:00:38,067
Sir? Sir!

659
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:40,983
Sir! Please!

660
01:00:41,525 --> 01:00:45,525
Sir! Please just take my girl!

661
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:52,567
Jung-seok, why are you the only one alive?

662
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:43,083
Put it down.

663
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,750
You'll drain the batteries.

664
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,083
Did Major Jane say she's coming to Incheon Port?

665
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,250
Huh?

666
01:01:57,333 --> 01:02:00,292
She should. She has to.

667
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:04,875
She better rescue my little darlings.

668
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:06,792
My treasures.

669
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,667
Yu-jin and Joon-i,

670
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:13,625
they're the beacon of hope in this hell.

671
01:02:16,542 --> 01:02:21,708
I'll get them out of this hell no matter what.

672
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:27,583
Major Jane is coming, right?

673
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,292
Are you okay?

674
01:02:51,417 --> 01:02:55,083
We stole these when we fled. Take what you need.

675
01:02:58,417 --> 01:03:00,542
I actually saw you before.

676
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:02,333
I...

677
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:06,333
came across your family
when I was fleeing to board the ship.

678
01:03:08,042 --> 01:03:09,750
You begged me to take your girl.

679
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:16,417
Why are you telling me that now?

680
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:18,875
Because you feel guilty?

681
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:21,167
There were 31 cars.

682
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:24,125
There were 31 cars that drove past us.

683
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:27,250
I thought the first car would stop to help us.

684
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,208
Or maybe the next one...

685
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,250
All 31 cars just drove by.

686
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:39,917
You're indebted to my girls.

687
01:03:45,542 --> 01:03:47,875
Yu-jin, I'm buttoning you up.
Stand up straight!

688
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,167
Are we going on a boat ride now?

689
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:55,250
Yes, we just have to get something first.

690
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:00,125
What about my cars?

691
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:02,958
No way, we can't take them all.

692
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:07,750
Then just this one!

693
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:09,125
Put it down.

694
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:10,875
Please, just one!

695
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:13,208
Let me take one!

696
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:17,792
Let's go.

697
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:09,417
Joon-i.

698
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:14,250
Stay here. If I'm not back by sunrise,
head back home.

699
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:16,042
Just the three of us?

700
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:18,000
What about you?

701
01:05:18,583 --> 01:05:19,875
How will you come home?

702
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,708
I'll find my way somehow,

703
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:24,583
so don't worry and head home.

704
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,958
And don't ever leave the car, got it?

705
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Answer me.

706
01:05:36,167 --> 01:05:37,167
Okay.

707
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:40,625
Yu-jin, come here.

708
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:48,542
I'll be back soon. Listen to your sister, okay?

709
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:51,083
You'll really be back soon, right?

710
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:52,750
Of course, I'll be right back.

711
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:08,292
Commander, take good care of my girls.

712
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:14,458
Let's go.

713
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,667
It's an emergency exit that we found
when we lived here.

714
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:55,583
What the hell?

715
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:14,667
Is that it?

716
01:08:18,167 --> 01:08:19,667
Yes, that's the one.

717
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:22,250
Let's move quickly.

718
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:27,583
Ah, ah, ah.

719
01:08:27,667 --> 01:08:30,333
I brought good news.

720
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:38,500
Last night, the third platoon led by Sergeant Hwang

721
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:40,042
brought home a truck.

722
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:44,917
There was enough food for everyone to eat

723
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,542
for an entire month.

724
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:53,583
You've worked so hard, I know you did!

725
01:08:53,667 --> 01:08:58,707
So tonight... there'll be an unlimited game

726
01:08:58,792 --> 01:09:00,500
for 24 hours!

727
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:05,500
And remember.

728
01:09:05,957 --> 01:09:08,125
Have fun like there's no tomorrow.

729
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:09,417
Have a great time!

730
01:09:13,457 --> 01:09:16,582
There will be no tomorrow.

731
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:20,625
Stop cheering. Doesn't he seem strange?

732
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:21,875
I think he's high.

733
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,417
I'm not sure. Let's enjoy this!

734
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,875
Hey, look over there.

735
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:33,542
Shouldn't we report that?

736
01:09:34,042 --> 01:09:37,042
There aren't that many. Why bother reporting?

737
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:39,167
Forget it, don't mind them.

738
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,625
Listen.

739
01:10:15,417 --> 01:10:17,167
Since you owe my girls,

740
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:20,625
do me a favor later.

741
01:10:35,042 --> 01:10:38,792
Johnnie Walker Black Label!

742
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:43,208
You're back.

743
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:48,250
Are you supposed to have booze here?

744
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:49,375
Well...

745
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:53,000
The game is about to start. What brings you here?

746
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:55,958
I haven't seen your face in ages.

747
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:59,917
Could I have a sip?

748
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,333
Sure, help yourself.

749
01:11:01,417 --> 01:11:02,583
- Really?
- Sure.

750
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:05,875
So why are you here?

751
01:11:06,042 --> 01:11:08,333
Do you have something to report?

752
01:11:08,417 --> 01:11:12,833
No, I was just curious
what gets you up in the morning.

753
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:16,250
Hm?

754
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:24,167
It's good?

755
01:11:24,375 --> 01:11:25,625
So good!

756
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,792
If you love it that much,
you can take the bottle.

757
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:32,625
It's my gift to you.

758
01:11:34,417 --> 01:11:36,167
- What's with you?
- What?

759
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:40,417
I begged for some snacks
for my boys to boost morale,

760
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,250
but all we got were scraps.

761
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:44,833
You were acting so cheap.

762
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:48,375
So why the sudden generosity?

763
01:11:49,542 --> 01:11:52,083
I think I told everyone with my speech earlier.

764
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,417
We owe so much to you and your men...

765
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,542
Bullshit!

766
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:05,167
I was just kidding.

767
01:12:06,375 --> 01:12:10,333
Captain Seo, are you hiding something from me?

768
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:14,208
No, of course not.

769
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:18,708
Captain Seo, I...

770
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:22,458
Private Kim?

771
01:12:23,833 --> 01:12:26,500
Do you visit Captain Seo's quarters frequently?

772
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:30,708
No... I do not.

773
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:57,500
Ah.

774
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,417
You two are a thing?

775
01:13:01,958 --> 01:13:03,625
- Yes.
- My apologies!

776
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:08,583
I'm so clueless.

777
01:13:09,417 --> 01:13:10,542
I'll leave you two alone.

778
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:12,833
Just the two of you...

779
01:13:12,917 --> 01:13:15,125
Hm?

780
01:13:15,917 --> 01:13:19,208
I'll tell the boys to avoid dropping in,

781
01:13:19,292 --> 01:13:20,458
so have a great time.

782
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:24,042
Have a hot time, okay?

783
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:25,792
All right.

784
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:28,542
Love, love is...

785
01:13:30,458 --> 01:13:32,667
Sir, the preparation is done.
Shall we get to the truck?

786
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:35,125
You go ahead. I have something to do first.

787
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:36,208
Yes, sir.

788
01:13:38,417 --> 01:13:40,542
Does he have a death wish or what?

789
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:54,625
Joon-i, look up ahead! Quickly!

790
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:05,708
It's a march.

791
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:17,792
That road is too close to Unit 631.

792
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:19,583
Aren't we going to go greet Mom?

793
01:14:51,292 --> 01:14:52,500
The money is intact.

794
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:17,625
Hey, can't you take me with you?

795
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:19,750
I really want to get out of here.

796
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,375
Go where? Who told you about that?

797
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:27,292
I overheard Captain Seo talking
on the satellite phone.

798
01:15:28,042 --> 01:15:29,458
Please take me with you.

799
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,208
Satellite phone?

800
01:15:31,833 --> 01:15:33,125
Where did you get it?

801
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,917
The wild dog we found in the truck had it.

802
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:37,917
Private Kim!

803
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,500
Aren't you going to see the game?

804
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:42,292
Answer naturally.

805
01:15:45,417 --> 01:15:46,583
I'm all right.

806
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:48,750
You always say that. Oh, right.

807
01:15:49,167 --> 01:15:51,750
That wild dog who came with the truck,

808
01:15:51,833 --> 01:15:53,458
that guy was no joke.

809
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:57,083
He was struggling so much to survive.

810
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:00,167
I bet all my canned goods on him!

811
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:02,125
I'll see you later.

812
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:05,458
Where is the phone now?

813
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:07,417
It's not with me.

814
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,083
Captain Seo has it. He'll be here soon.

815
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:14,417
Get going.

816
01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:16,750
I can't wait long.

817
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:26,167
Act naturally when that bastard comes, got it?

818
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:28,875
Okay...

819
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:32,833
Number 61!

820
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:56,833
What are you doing? Let's move!

821
01:16:58,792 --> 01:17:00,083
Captain...

822
01:17:01,542 --> 01:17:03,083
Long time no see, Captain Seo.

823
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:06,958
Min-jung, you were alive. Gosh.

824
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,792
You have the satellite phone, right?

825
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,000
Hand it over.

826
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:14,208
The satellite phone...

827
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:16,000
Give me a second.

828
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:18,417
Mm. Oh.

829
01:17:32,167 --> 01:17:33,208
Wasn't that a gunshot?

830
01:17:33,292 --> 01:17:35,042
Like hell it was. Just shut up and eat this tuna.

831
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,167
Hey!

832
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:42,208
Oh.

833
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:45,667
Let's go get Mom.

834
01:18:02,625 --> 01:18:04,417
Look! That bastard!

835
01:18:09,292 --> 01:18:10,750
Gun! Get the guns!

836
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:16,042
- Are you okay?
- Yes...

837
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:17,708
Can you get up?

838
01:18:18,167 --> 01:18:20,083
Yes, I can get up. I can get up.

839
01:18:27,417 --> 01:18:28,667
Stay behind me.

840
01:18:31,292 --> 01:18:33,667
Hey, where did he go?

841
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Jesus Christ...

842
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:40,458
Min-jung, I was so worried...

843
01:18:42,542 --> 01:18:44,458
That's mine, give it back...

844
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:49,375
Sergeant!

845
01:18:51,417 --> 01:18:53,083
Where did that bastard go?

846
01:18:57,375 --> 01:18:58,583
Go look for him.

847
01:19:06,042 --> 01:19:07,208
Block the entrance!

848
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:12,417
Move!

849
01:20:02,333 --> 01:20:03,542
Fire! Fire!

850
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,000
Hey. Go forward.

851
01:21:01,125 --> 01:21:02,125
Damn it!

852
01:21:02,292 --> 01:21:03,292
Jung-seok!

853
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,208
Sergeant!

854
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:05,417
Come on!

855
01:22:49,542 --> 01:22:52,125
Hurry! Get in!

856
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:58,625
Get in! Come on!

857
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:04,208
Snap out of it!

858
01:23:04,917 --> 01:23:06,167
Come on!

859
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:08,667
Hurry!

860
01:23:29,042 --> 01:23:32,042
Go after them!

861
01:23:46,792 --> 01:23:48,583
Captain, are you okay?

862
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:52,875
What do we do now, sir?

863
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:57,250
Captain!

864
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,167
You did all you can.

865
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:08,958
That's what matters.

866
01:24:09,292 --> 01:24:10,417
Get it together.

867
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:36,417
Sergeant Hwang!

868
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:39,500
Step on it!

869
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:46,667
It's time for us. To say goodbye

870
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:49,333
Let's meet again soon

871
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,333
Grandpa, hurry!

872
01:26:04,708 --> 01:26:06,083
Okay!

873
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,750
Open the window.

874
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,375
Mom!

875
01:26:35,875 --> 01:26:38,500
We came to greet you!

876
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:40,833
Why don't you ever listen to me?

877
01:26:42,083 --> 01:26:43,208
Come on!

878
01:26:57,208 --> 01:26:58,417
Yee-haw!

879
01:27:23,667 --> 01:27:25,792
- Hold on.
- Okay!

880
01:27:54,708 --> 01:27:59,792
Hey! Stop with the damn flares!
Just kill them all!

881
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:20,833
They're behind us!

882
01:28:27,208 --> 01:28:28,375
Hold on tight!

883
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:43,083
Come on!

884
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:55,042
You asshole!

885
01:29:03,333 --> 01:29:04,542
He's not bad.

886
01:29:50,958 --> 01:29:52,917
Pull up closer, asshole!

887
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,417
This way, move up!

888
01:29:55,583 --> 01:29:56,583
Kill him!

889
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:13,542
Watch the front, asshole!

890
01:30:13,917 --> 01:30:15,000
Hold the wheel!

891
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Hey!

892
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:29,292
Turn on the lights.

893
01:30:54,958 --> 01:30:56,208
To our right!

894
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,042
Beside you!

895
01:31:38,208 --> 01:31:39,208
Watch out!

896
01:32:24,625 --> 01:32:25,750
Hold on tight!

897
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:40,792
Go over to the right!

898
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,292
Hey! Back up, back up, back up!

899
01:34:20,042 --> 01:34:22,250
Back it up!

900
01:34:23,708 --> 01:34:26,625
I said back it up, asshole!

901
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:32,125
Just step on it!

902
01:34:33,208 --> 01:34:35,542
Back the shit up!

903
01:34:36,333 --> 01:34:38,208
What the hell are you doing? Back it up!

904
01:34:42,292 --> 01:34:43,375
You bastard!

905
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:10,750
We're almost there.

906
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
We arrive at Incheon Port in 15 minutes.

907
01:35:58,750 --> 01:35:59,750
Joon-i.

908
01:36:00,375 --> 01:36:03,167
Is that the boat? Oh, yes!

909
01:36:14,333 --> 01:36:15,375
Yu-jin...

910
01:36:16,167 --> 01:36:17,292
Yu-jin, are you okay?

911
01:36:18,583 --> 01:36:19,625
Hi.

912
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Joon-i!

913
01:36:26,792 --> 01:36:29,208
Put down your gun! Come on!

914
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:32,292
Drop it!

915
01:36:32,833 --> 01:36:34,833
Do you want to see her head blown up?

916
01:36:34,917 --> 01:36:36,000
Put it down!

917
01:36:41,042 --> 01:36:43,458
Kick it! Kick it away!

918
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:45,792
Yes, that's it.

919
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:51,875
I can finally get off this peninsula...

920
01:36:52,583 --> 01:36:57,625
When I leave, I'm going to live
to the fullest in Hong Kong.

921
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
They won't know what I did here.

922
01:37:03,375 --> 01:37:05,333
I'm going to be a good man.

923
01:37:06,083 --> 01:37:09,500
Thank you. Thank you so much.

924
01:37:09,583 --> 01:37:11,167
I'll thank you every night.

925
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:13,792
I really mean it. Thank you so much.

926
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:16,292
I love you all!

927
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:17,375
Now!

928
01:37:20,375 --> 01:37:21,375
Okay...

929
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:28,458
No!

930
01:37:59,792 --> 01:38:01,250
Grandpa...

931
01:38:02,208 --> 01:38:04,958
Grandpa, are you okay?

932
01:38:05,333 --> 01:38:06,583
Grandpa...

933
01:38:06,792 --> 01:38:08,375
Mom! Mom...

934
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:43,042
The sun is rising.

935
01:38:43,125 --> 01:38:44,125
A horde's coming.

936
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:45,875
We have to depart!

937
01:38:57,792 --> 01:38:58,875
The money's here.

938
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:03,167
Huh?

939
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:05,792
It's not him.

940
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:08,958
How many times did they switch?

941
01:39:11,875 --> 01:39:13,083
Nice to meet you...

942
01:39:13,708 --> 01:39:15,917
- Nice to meet you too.
- Thank you.

943
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:26,500
Get rid of the body!

944
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:44,167
Hey, stop!

945
01:39:54,167 --> 01:39:57,083
Get the money!

946
01:39:57,167 --> 01:40:00,083
Shut the back hatch! Zombies are coming!

947
01:40:32,708 --> 01:40:35,417
Grandpa...

948
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:41,000
Okay, I'm okay...

949
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,750
Grandpa...

950
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:50,583
I wanted to pull you out of this hell...

951
01:40:53,833 --> 01:40:55,000
No...

952
01:40:56,458 --> 01:40:59,167
We were together all along.

953
01:41:00,625 --> 01:41:02,625
Why would this be hell?

954
01:41:04,667 --> 01:41:05,708
Thank you...

955
01:41:06,625 --> 01:41:08,542
Grandpa...

956
01:41:12,583 --> 01:41:14,208
Grandpa!

957
01:41:15,792 --> 01:41:17,250
I'm sorry...

958
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:21,042
for making you live in this world...

959
01:41:21,417 --> 01:41:23,542
Grandpa...

960
01:41:25,167 --> 01:41:29,000
- Grandpa...
- I'm sorry...

961
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:30,667
Grandpa.

962
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:37,708
Grandpa!

963
01:41:42,833 --> 01:41:44,583
Don't die...

964
01:41:49,667 --> 01:41:52,375
Grandpa! No!

965
01:41:54,792 --> 01:41:56,333
Grandpa...

966
01:42:36,875 --> 01:42:38,583
Girls! The fireworks!

967
01:42:38,667 --> 01:42:39,708
Hurry!

968
01:42:41,167 --> 01:42:42,167
Joon-i!

969
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:52,167
You promised to do a favor for me.

970
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:56,458
Take the girls with you no matter what.

971
01:42:57,292 --> 01:42:58,333
Got it?

972
01:42:58,667 --> 01:42:59,667
Promise me, okay?

973
01:43:00,417 --> 01:43:01,458
Get going!

974
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:03,250
Now!

975
01:43:17,667 --> 01:43:20,792
Commander, thank you.

976
01:44:08,083 --> 01:44:10,333
Mom's falling behind!

977
01:45:12,417 --> 01:45:13,583
Are you all right?

978
01:45:13,792 --> 01:45:14,958
You're safe now!

979
01:45:18,708 --> 01:45:19,708
Jane...

980
01:45:19,792 --> 01:45:20,792
Jane!

981
01:45:20,875 --> 01:45:23,833
Jane! We have to save my mom!

982
01:45:23,917 --> 01:45:25,250
I'm sorry. It's too late!

983
01:45:25,333 --> 01:45:26,542
We can't put you in danger.

984
01:45:26,625 --> 01:45:27,708
We must leave now!

985
01:45:27,792 --> 01:45:30,542
Please, help my mom!

986
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:32,750
Please! Just this once!

987
01:45:32,917 --> 01:45:33,917
Go! Let's go!

988
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,208
Let's go!

989
01:45:35,292 --> 01:45:36,458
You must wait!

990
01:45:39,167 --> 01:45:40,208
Please...

991
01:45:41,792 --> 01:45:43,750
Remain calm...

992
01:45:54,125 --> 01:45:55,500
Don't wait for me...

993
01:46:19,792 --> 01:46:20,792
No...

994
01:46:22,208 --> 01:46:23,208
Mom!

995
01:46:23,292 --> 01:46:26,083
Don't do it, Mom!

996
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:36,542
Let go of me!

997
01:46:40,167 --> 01:46:41,167
Mom!

998
01:46:50,292 --> 01:46:51,917
Mom, please!

999
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,792
She made a very sensible decision.

1000
01:47:03,458 --> 01:47:07,333
It was for the best! For everyone...

1001
01:47:08,458 --> 01:47:10,125
Sensible decision, my ass.

1002
01:47:12,167 --> 01:47:13,333
Did you even try?

1003
01:47:16,125 --> 01:47:17,125
Jung-seok...

1004
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:20,000
You're tormented too!

1005
01:47:21,708 --> 01:47:23,042
You just gave up!

1006
01:47:23,125 --> 01:47:25,750
We have to save Mom!

1007
01:47:32,708 --> 01:47:34,292
I'll bring back your mom.

1008
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:36,708
Wait right here.

1009
01:47:48,708 --> 01:47:50,917
Mom! Run!

1010
01:49:21,958 --> 01:49:24,333
- Mom!
- Mom!

1011
01:49:31,917 --> 01:49:32,917
Mom!

1012
01:50:49,833 --> 01:50:52,667
Don't worry. She'll be okay.

1013
01:50:57,417 --> 01:50:58,708
She'll be fine.

1014
01:51:12,542 --> 01:51:15,250
In a few hours, a new world will be waiting.

1015
01:51:17,042 --> 01:51:20,792
The world I knew wasn't bad either.

1016
01:51:51,125 --> 01:51:54,654
