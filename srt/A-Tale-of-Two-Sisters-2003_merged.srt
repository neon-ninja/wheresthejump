1
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,200
How was your day today?
How was it?

2
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,310
First tell me about yourself

3
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,720
Who do you think you are?

4
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,570
Do you know who this is?

5
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,770
Don't know?

6
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,580
It's your family

7
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,680
Want to see it again?

8
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,290
Fine then

9
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,700
Can you tell me

10
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,200
about that day?

11
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,610
About what happened?

12
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,710
You should be able
to remember it clearly

13
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,210
It's okay

14
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,960
From now on

15
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,960
tell me what happened

16
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,440
Aren't you getting out?

17
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,230
Su-yeon

18
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,530
Su-yeon!

19
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,190
It's so pretty

20
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,520
Give me your hand

21
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,520
The other one

22
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,730
Why?

23
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,550
Su-mi!

24
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,880
Welcome home!

25
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,280
It's been such a long time

26
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,180
You've changed
so much Su-yeon

27
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,380
You've gotten prettier

28
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,490
But you two
really disappointed me

29
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,790
I waited all day for you two

30
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,590
cooking and cleaning the house

31
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,700
but why didn't
you say hi first?

32
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,890
What did you do?

33
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,800
Were you at the wharf?

34
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,110
You should've changed first
before you went outside

35
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,300
Anyway

36
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,510
welcome back home

37
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,930
Is something wrong?

38
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,030
I see you've gotten better

39
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,270
I'm so glad
you feel better now

40
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,170
You're taking after your mom

41
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,880
You're feeling
a lot better too right?

42
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,790
Right
I bet you're both tired

43
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,090
Get some rest
and come down for dinner

44
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,200
I'm preparing a
special dinner

45
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,700
But you should
give me some time

46
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,890
There's a lot to prepare

47
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,090
We just got back

48
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,500
Things don't look
so good right now

49
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,510
It wouldn't help much
if you came

50
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,110
Yeah I know

51
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,340
Let's talk later
I should go

52
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,150
So you're doing okay right?

53
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,750
Did I tell you?

54
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,360
Sun-kyu and his wife
are coming over

55
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,550
lt'll be alright
I'll take care of it

56
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,860
Okay bye

57
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,850
Oh right!

58
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,360
I invited Sun-kyu and his wife over

59
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,760
for dinner this weekend

60
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,960
Really?

61
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,860
Lt'll be nice for them to
see the girls after so long

62
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,370
And to catch up on things

63
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,870
That was delicious

64
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,880
Sorry I have things to tend to

65
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,680
You must be tired
so clean it up tomorrow

66
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,330
Did you prepare
your father's undergarments?

67
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,030
Thanks but that's my job

68
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,840
Cleaning my room is my job too
Why'd you touch my stuff?

69
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,540
That's how it was before

70
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,340
So all of the same clothes
were hanging there before?

71
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,570
I'm not having
dinner with him

72
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,270
What?

73
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,680
I said I'm not having
dinner with that guy

74
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,180
He's not some guy
he's your uncle

75
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,390
It's the first day
so let's give it a rest

76
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,540
And you?
Yes?

77
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,200
Aren't you going to follow her?
You're supposed to follow your sister

78
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,040
What did that woman tell you?

79
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,250
If she ever gets on your case
then tell me

80
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,280
And don't ignore it like before
Okay?

81
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,090
Good night

82
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

83
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,200
What's wrong?

84
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,400
Did you have a bad dream?

85
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,600
Was it the closet?

86
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,210
Then what's wrong?

87
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,440
I keep hearing
strange noises outside

88
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,750
It's because
you've been away too long

89
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,960
It's okay
Let's sleep

90
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:23,470
Somebody came into my room

91
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
He's asleep

92
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,830
I know
Then why are you trying to wake him?

93
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,830
Says who?

94
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,430
You were trying
to wake him just now

95
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,440
Have something to tell him?

96
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,140
It's none of your business

97
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,750
All I'm saying is
since his fast asleep

98
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,250
Don't wake him up
Don't you understand me?

99
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,550
I just came down for water

100
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,260
He's asleep so be quiet

101
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,740
Did you go to my room?

102
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,840
Yes

103
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,280
Who was it?

104
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,290
That woman

105
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,490
Stepmom?

106
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,700
Yeah

107
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,900
It's strange

108
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,510
What is?

109
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:32,610
That woman is strange

110
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:37,110
And so is this house

111
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,130
Are you scared?

112
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:55,240
Everything's alright
I'm here

113
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,640
Come here
Let's sleep

114
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,980
I'll always be with you

115
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

116
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,020
Su-yeon Go away

117
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

118
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

119
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

120
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,670
Are you awake?

121
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,570
Yes

122
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:33,270
Can I come in?
No

123
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,080
Come down and eat

124
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,650
What are you doing?

125
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,960
Are you having your period?

126
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,360
No Su-yeon is

127
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,870
Su-yeon?

128
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,570
That's so funny

129
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:53,780
How could we both get our periods
on the same date?

130
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,120
Su-mi

131
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,120
It's okay come down

132
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,710
That's mom's favorite huh?

133
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,120
Do it like this

134
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:50,230
Shall we kill them?

135
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,930
Let's set them free

136
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,940
She'll have a cow
if we mess with her precious

137
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,270
I'd hate to see that

138
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,080
Su-mi

139
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,800
What are you doing
out in the cold?

140
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,700
Are you alright?

141
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,010
Why?

142
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:32,410
You don't look so good
Are you feeling sick?

143
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,710
No I'm okay

144
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:37,010
Tell me what's wrong?

145
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:40,320
I said I'm okay

146
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,020
Just get rid of
Su-yeon's closet

147
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,930
Su-mi

148
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,520
we agreed not to talk about
that closet

149
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,130
You promised right?

150
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,470
Su-mi

151
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:09,480
I know you're
very angry with me

152
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,420
And I know I'm a bad father

153
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,060
You're not even a bad father

154
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,600
It's cold so let's go inside

155
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,100
I will

156
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,880
What are you doing?

157
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:43,490
You scared me

158
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,090
When did you come in?

159
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,600
Did you go to the warehouse?
Yeah

160
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,250
Su-yeon look at this

161
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,950
Tada!

162
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,560
Wow

163
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:14,950
Cool
Pretty huh?

164
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:19,360
Is it mom's?
Yup and

165
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,470
There's more

166
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,760
It's mom!

167
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:33,470
Taritakoom taritakoom

168
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:35,580
What does that mean?

169
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,080
It's a spell to call mom

170
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,480
Who told you that?

171
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,990
Mom did
What?

172
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,090
Can I take this?

173
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,890
Huh? Sure

174
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:59,100
This and this

175
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,040
Wait!

176
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,840
What is this?

177
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,640
Who did this to you?

178
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,660
Tell me who did this?

179
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:22,350
It's okay tell me

180
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,460
She did this huh?

181
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,060
She did this didn't she?

182
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,160
Su-yeon
what's wrong with you?

183
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,770
I told you to
tell me everything!

184
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:36,880
She did this right?

185
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,880
She did this huh?
Did she do this?

186
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:43,570
Tell me! Tell me!
Tell me! Tell me!

187
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,250
What?

188
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:24,860
How can you be so cruel?

189
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,650
It's retribution

190
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,960
If you disobey
you need to be punished

191
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,760
Does dad know what you did?

192
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,170
Think your father
can solve everything?

193
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,360
Then go get him
Want me to do it?

194
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:43,570
Sit down!
Where are your manners?

195
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,180
Were you like this
to your mom too?

196
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,180
Don't bring up my mom!

197
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:51,180
Listen carefully
I'm your mother got it?

198
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,870
As much as you hate it

199
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,680
I'm the only one in this world

200
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,480
you can call mother got it?

201
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,750
Crying over your mom's photos

202
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,690
won't change anything

203
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,890
Hard to handle huh?
That's too bad

204
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,890
But that's how the world is

205
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:09,590
The world isn't as sweet
as you picture it

206
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,000
Sometimes you have to bear the worst
and live on

207
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:14,800
Like the way
I'm bearing you two!

208
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,600
Tough isn't it?

209
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,610
I have beared you two brats

210
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,910
from the moment I came to this house

211
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,310
I have never met such ill-mannered

212
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,920
menaces like you two

213
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,720
What?

214
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,330
Why the hell did
you even come here?

215
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:47,040
I can't believe you
said that to me again

216
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:53,140
I see you still must be sick

217
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,410
Don't touch me

218
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,320
Let go!
What's wrong with you?

219
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,330
Are you that clueless?

220
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,440
Don't touch me
with those filthy hands!

221
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,130
Su-mi listen to me

222
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:54,330
I don't want to hear it
You're the same

223
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:56,440
That's not true
you've misunderstood

224
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,040
You're not even
accepting all this

225
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,970
Why is it always me?

226
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:04,980
Why are you asking only me
to understand?

227
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,880
Are you really clueless?

228
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,290
Yeah

229
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,190
Maybe I don't know
I don't have all the answers

230
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,190
I don't know so tell me
and let it off your chest

231
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:17,890
Tell me!

232
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:21,800
Will it change anything?
Will it?

233
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,800
Su-mi

234
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:32,000
Don't do this
Please don't

235
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:35,400
You'll get sick again

236
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:38,610
What?

237
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,320
Fine

238
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:57,330
From now on
anything that happens here

239
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:02,970
all the filthy things
you brought here

240
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,670
be responsible for it all

241
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,280
I have nothing more to say
so answer the phone

242
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,290
Do you remember?

243
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:39,600
My memory's a bit blurry
but I think it did happen

244
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,210
When was it?

245
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,000
Hey remember this?

246
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,900
You jumped into the rive

247
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,310
to catch some fish

248
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,610
Then you started to drown

249
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,510
and everyone had a fit

250
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,720
There was another funny story

251
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:01,050
What was it?
Oh yeah I remember

252
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,750
Remember that crazy guy?

253
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,160
The funny thing is
is that he was always normal

254
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,170
but whenever it rained
he went nuts

255
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,260
While plowing the field

256
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,770
he'd strip off his clothes
when it rained

257
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:18,270
and run out into the highway

258
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,670
The funniest time was

259
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:24,180
when it rained off and on

260
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:29,080
So he'd put on and take off
his clothes again and again

261
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:35,090
Then he got sick of it
and just went into his house

262
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:42,990
Everyone in the neighborhood
laughed so much back then

263
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:44,190
But when

264
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:47,700
But when he was little
he saw him doing that once

265
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:51,200
He saw him doing that once
and then he ran together

266
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,600
with that crazy guy

267
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:00,840
Our mom saw that
and she almost passed out

268
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,340
Do you remember?

269
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,740
You remember right?

270
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:09,850
Say something

271
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:11,850
Don't you remember?

272
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:16,750
You remember right?

273
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,070
No

274
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,670
I don't remember

275
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,670
What?

276
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:35,570
I said I don't remember

277
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,030
Why don't you remember?

278
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,640
Are you crazy?

279
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:40,680
Mi-hee!

280
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,150
Mi-hee!

281
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,690
Wait hold on to her

282
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,590
What's wrong?
Wake up!

283
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,190
Bring some water

284
00:57:57,330 --> 00:57:58,690
Are you alright Mi-hee?

285
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,130
Water water

286
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,060
I'm sorry it's all my fault

287
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:46,880
Mi-hee!

288
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:48,580
It's okay

289
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,490
It's alright Mi-hee

290
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,020
It's alright

291
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,670
I'm sorry

292
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,810
I didn't want to come
but your father begged me to

293
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:50,100
so I had no choice

294
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:53,570
Honey
Yes?

295
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:58,080
I saw something strange
in that house

296
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What did you see?
There was a girl
under the sink

297
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,210
Just go in

298
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

299
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:18,770
Can't you just stay here?
Why?

300
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:20,980
It's strange

301
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:23,270
What's strange?

302
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,280
It's strange

303
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,080
After the girls came down

304
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:30,880
weird things have been
happening in this house

305
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:34,290
Don't say stupid things

306
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:36,690
Didn't you see it?

307
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:41,490
You're just having a hard time adjusting
You'll get better if you rest

308
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:43,500
No

309
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:49,800
There's something
in this house

310
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:57,310
I'll look around
so lie down

311
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

312
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:16,140
Open the door!

313
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:17,750
Open it!

314
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,350
Open the god damn door!

315
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,170
I'll show you

316
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:47,370
Get up!

317
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:52,480
Get off the bed

318
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,790
Get off now!

319
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,730
I said now!

320
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:30,150
Come here right now!

321
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:35,860
You pest

322
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,570
Talk!

323
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:55,480
A person can't get any rest
around this household

324
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:03,080
Tell me
Who did it?

325
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:06,790
Who did it?

326
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:09,390
Who?
Better tell me the truth

327
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:11,790
Who did it!

328
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:14,190
Was it Su-mi?

329
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:18,000
You two need
to learn a lesson!

330
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,000
Was it your sister?

331
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:41,920
So do you feel better looking
at your dead mom's things?

332
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,220
Feel happy
after seeing the photos?

333
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,880
Say that you're sorry

334
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,490
Until you do don't even
think about coming out

335
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,800
There's no use in crying

336
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:31,000
Say that you're sorry
and beg for forgiveness!

337
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,610
I'm sorry

338
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:36,510
What?

339
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:39,110
Say it right

340
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:42,510
I'm sorry

341
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,530
I'll ask you once more

342
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:59,430
You're admitting
that you're sorry right?

343
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:04,470
Stop crying

344
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:08,480
I don't want to hear it
so stop it now!

345
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,080
Are you

346
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:16,980
Are you mad?

347
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:21,080
Is that why you're crying?

348
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:30,030
Fine let's see
how long you hold up

349
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,100
This will put some sense
into you two

350
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:53,610
Su-yeon

351
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,550
Su-yeon I'm sorry

352
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,260
I didn't hear you

353
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,960
I'm sorry Su-yeon
I'm sorry

354
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:24,480
This won't happen again

355
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:28,290
I promise

356
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,270
Don't cry it's okay

357
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:53,900
Tell me
What?

358
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,200
Why the hell
are you doing this?

359
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,800
Tell me why you've acted

360
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:02,850
so weird since you got here

361
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,540
You really don't know?

362
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,840
Don't know what? What is it?

363
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,850
I'm talking about
what that woman is doing to us!

364
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:11,150
So tell me what has she done?

365
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:13,450
She keeps harassing Su-yeon

366
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:17,760
What?

367
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,950
Didn't you hear me?

368
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:23,360
I said she keeps harassing Su-yeon!

369
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,260
She's vicious evil

370
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:28,270
and always locks Su-yeon up
in the closet!

371
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:30,870
Su-mi please stop it

372
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:33,980
Stop what?

373
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:38,770
You know that
Su-yeon is scared of her

374
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:43,380
Su-yeon you tell dad

375
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,780
Stop crying
and tell him now

376
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,590
Tell him!

377
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:50,690
Please stop it!

378
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:58,200
Su-yeon is dead

379
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:05,130
What?

380
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:10,150
No

381
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:15,550
Su-yeon is dead

382
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:19,060
So pull yourself together

383
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,660
How long will you keep this up?

384
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:43,670
It's not true Su-yeon

385
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:48,680
Su-yeon

386
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:59,190
Su-yeon No No

387
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:29,950
Come down tomorrow
I can't do it alone

388
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,060
Hmm

389
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,960
She's getting worse

390
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:43,610
I'll pick you up
call me when you get here

391
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,610
Su-yeon!

392
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:27,910
Su-yeon!

393
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:30,400
Su-yeon!

394
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,290
Su-mi!
Su-yeon!

395
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:43,170
Su-yeon!

396
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

397
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

398
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:44,390
Su-yeon!

399
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,080
Su-yeon!

400
01:26:53,530 --> 01:26:57,590
I am fed up with your family

401
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:06,820
How did we come to this?

402
01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:16,730
Don't you get it yet?

403
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:23,540
Remember what
I told you before?

404
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:29,550
Remember when I said
you'll regret it some day?

405
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:38,750
You

406
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,450
Know what's really scary?

407
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:50,160
You want to forget something

408
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:54,670
Totally wipe it off of your mind

409
01:29:56,810 --> 01:29:59,080
But you never can

410
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:01,410
It can't go away you see

411
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:04,680
And

412
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:10,680
And it follows you around
like a ghost

413
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:17,400
Help me

414
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:32,310
Sure I'll help you

415
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:35,810
Let's end it here

416
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:22,290
Su-mi!

417
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:24,700
Su-mi!

418
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:26,700
Su-mi!

419
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:54,320
Where's Su-mi?

420
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,620
Where?

421
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,860
Please stop it

422
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,360
I'm sick of it now

423
01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:15,670
Take this
you'll feel much better

424
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,500
Su-mi!

425
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,980
Don't you get it yet?

426
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:39,880
You're just having
a hard time adjusting

427
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:41,180
You still must be sick

428
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:42,790
You promised not to
bring up that closet

429
01:35:42,930 --> 01:35:44,990
How could we both get our periods
on the same date?

430
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:46,600
Su-yeon is dead!

431
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:48,200
No I don't remember!

432
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,990
Su-mi are you okay?

433
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,320
It's all over now

434
01:38:07,070 --> 01:38:09,830
You'll feel better here

435
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:18,850
Get some rest

436
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:22,550
I'll come and visit often

437
01:38:29,390 --> 01:38:33,260
Take care of yourself
Bye

438
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:43,070
Su-mi what's wrong?
Let go

439
01:38:44,410 --> 01:38:46,470
Let go Su-mi

440
01:38:48,410 --> 01:38:51,570
Please stop it and let go

441
01:40:08,930 --> 01:40:11,690
No I'll get it
Let me take one

442
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:52,420
Mom

443
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:16,180
Su-yeon!

444
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

445
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

446
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

447
01:46:32,410 --> 01:46:33,310
Su-yeon!

448
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:28,460
Mom?

449
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:33,470
Mom? Mom mom!

450
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:39,370
Mom! Mom mom mom!

451
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:40,670
Mom!

452
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:14,230
Didn't you hear something?

453
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:19,240
Why'd you come up here?

454
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:22,740
Dad's not here

455
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:26,540
What do you mean by that?

456
01:49:26,980 --> 01:49:30,440
Now you're trying
to act like mom

457
01:49:33,290 --> 01:49:35,090
Do me a favor

458
01:49:35,290 --> 01:49:38,230
Stay out of our lives

459
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:46,260
Can you get out of the way?

460
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:48,970
I have to go

461
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:54,170
You

462
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:56,870
You might regret this moment

463
01:49:57,010 --> 01:49:59,170
Keep that in mind!

464
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,780
What can be worse

465
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:07,080
than standing here with you?

466
01:50:09,530 --> 01:50:11,080
When you're here

467
01:50:11,230 --> 01:50:14,200
I wanna be as far away
from you as I can

468
01:50:14,630 --> 01:50:16,390
Understand?

469
01:50:29,450 --> 01:50:31,210
Su-mi!

470
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:36,710
Su-mi!

471
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:10,780
Help me Su-mi

472
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:14,860
Su-mi Su-mi

473
01:51:16,430 --> 01:51:18,360
Su-mi

474
