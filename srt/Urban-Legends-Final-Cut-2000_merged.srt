1
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,630
Afraid of flying?

2
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,992
You shouldn't be. It's really safe.
Except in that movie.

3
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,479
They had this, like, creature on the
wing of the plane.

4
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,071
Heard they based that on a true story.

5
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,234
Planes crash all the time.

6
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,716
They cover it up,
buy off the witnesses.

7
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,435
Where the hell are
the flight attendants?

8
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,872
It's all based on the aerodynamics
of hydrometeorology.

9
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,030
Hey. Ever heard
of the Mile High Club?

10
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,714
Come on.

11
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,311
He's sick.

12
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,516
Come on.

13
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,836
I don't know if we should do this.

14
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,360
Oh, you think?

15
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,791
No. We should.

16
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,035
Get over here!

17
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,400
"You're going down."

18
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,750
I sure am, baby.

19
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,720
No. Rob!

20
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,910
Stop!

21
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,676
What the fuck's going on? Let's go!
Go, go!

22
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,956
Oh, God!

23
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,715
Mayday! Mayday!

24
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Mayday!
Mayday! Mayday!

25
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,750
Cut!

26
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,833
Hey, guys!
When I say "cut," that means stop!

27
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,429
Thank you.

28
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,671
Sandra. You're not supposed
to fly the plane.

29
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,111
Jesus! Vanessa.

30
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,678
Thanks for getting the boom
in the shot again.

31
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,679
Poor Sandra.

32
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,198
He whines like a real director.

33
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm sorry.
You know, who are we kidding?

34
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,751
She's no Jamie Lee Curtis, right?
But she'll get better.

35
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,477
Young man, that woman's acting would
be wretched in a porno film.

36
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,911
He's right. I've seen her in a couple
of them. She's really bad.

37
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,840
- I thought there was...
- Shut up, scrote.

38
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,480
Get me a cup of coffee.

39
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,830
Hi, Amy.

40
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,037
Let's try something new this time:

41
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,273
Why don't you get it right,
or I'll kill you?!

42
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,319
Let's try it again. Back to one.

43
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,079
Take 41.

44
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,910
Effects up.

45
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,639
Effects up. Effects up!!

46
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,671
- Roll sound.
- Soundspeed.

47
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,434
- Roll camera.
- Rolling.

48
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,313
Scene 16, take 41.

49
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,239
Fucking action.

50
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,710
As chairman of the film department...

51
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,876
I want to wish you all the best as
you return for the spring semester...

52
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,593
and remind you that yours is the
honor and the privilege to attend...

53
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,554
the greatest film school
that ever existed.

54
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,799
So let's try
and not burn the place down.

55
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,634
Mr. Solomon?

56
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,991
Did everyone have a nice,
toasty holiday?

57
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,473
I'd like to personally welcome
Melvin Zarcoff...

58
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,831
who joins us after a distinguished
Hollywood career.

59
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,520
Welcome.

60
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,394
Mr. Zarcoff...

61
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,671
is a veteran of over 50 films...

62
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,913
Ten bucks he croaks
before the end of the semester.

63
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,719
You don't have ten bucks.
You spent it on your shitty movie.

64
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,195
Come on. A little courtesy?

65
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,675
Yeah, shut the fuck up.

66
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,280
You're so mean.

67
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,359
Clive Lavey will be offering
a new super-8 course.

68
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,550
Action!

69
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,912
Which is required before
you go on to the video workshops.

70
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,476
He the one that did
<i>Vampire Cheerleaders</i>?

71
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,997
No, that was Nick LaVey.
Clive did the Splattertown sequels.

72
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,520
Not enough blood for me.

73
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,030
Some of you have yet
to submit your screenplays.

74
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,717
At the end of the semester,
you may submit your thesis films...

75
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,311
to be considered for the prestigious
Hitchcock Award...

76
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,870
which not only carries with it,
as you all know, a $15,000 stipend...

77
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,838
but, I'm proud to say, has become a
springboard to Hollywood success...

78
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,720
- for such alumni as...
- Cecily Spector.

79
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,233
Josh Bouvet.

80
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,995
Chip Voelker.

81
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,079
And Chip Voelker.

82
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,919
Young lady!

83
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,036
Come here! Come here. What are you
doing out here in the dark?

84
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,999
I was going to the library.

85
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,874
Alone? At this hour? In this weather?

86
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,152
Girl, get in this car. I'll drive you.

87
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,953
So cold.

88
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,796
No "Show me your badge,"
no "Can I see some ID?"

89
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,632
Can I see some ID?

90
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,030
I got no ID.

91
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,272
- Where you going?
- Over the bridge to the...

92
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,358
Library, right.

93
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,876
Good for you, baby.

94
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,711
My name's Reese.
What's your name, sugar?

95
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,076
I'm Amy.

96
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,515
Nice lion.
You ever hide a gun in there?

97
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,197
- What makes you say that?
- I'm a film student.

98
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,440
I had a class last semester
where we saw Pam Grier.

99
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,395
She had this film where she hides a gun
inside a lion like that.

100
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,159
<i>Coffy.</i>

101
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,875
That's one of my favorite films of hers.

102
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,790
I even have my gun
trimmed in gold like hers.

103
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,195
Look at that.

104
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,640
I've always been partial to Foxy Brown.

105
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,474
"That's my sister, baby.

106
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,515
And she's a whole lot of woman!"

107
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,558
You'll do action movies like <i>Coffy</i>?

108
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,671
I don't know. I have to make a thesis
film. I can't think of a good story.

109
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,591
I got a good story.

110
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,796
Yeah, it's about a campus serial killer
who murders eight students...

111
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,273
but nothing happens because the
prestigious university covers it up.

112
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,997
I heard this one.
It supposedly happened at Pendleton.

113
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,839
It was just an urban legend.

114
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,599
You didn't let me finish.

115
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,917
After the murders,
the chief of security...

116
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,880
who refused to go along with the
cover-up, is fired.

117
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,834
Spends the entire year looking
for work.

118
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,193
Finally lands an entry-level position
at another university.

119
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,119
Thanks for the ride.

120
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,998
- Oh, yeah, baby, any time.
- Have a good night.

121
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,155
Urban legend, my ass.

122
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,075
A lot of film historians don't seem
to be able to gauge...

123
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,957
the impact of mise en so? Ne
on cinema v? Rit? Storytelling.

124
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,399
On the other hand, it could be argued
mise en so? Ne or staging...

125
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,116
are two examples that are basically
mutually exclusive.

126
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,676
What is cinema v? Rit? If not...

127
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,593
the absence of staging?

128
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,029
- And so on.
- Come in.

129
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,079
- Godard's victims...
- Sorry. I'll come back later.

130
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,836
Draped in the trees in the French
countryside.

131
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,509
I just had an idea
for my thesis film so...

132
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,877
Come in. Sit down.

133
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,319
Hi, Dr. Fain.

134
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,595
So...

135
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,949
the movie is about a serial killer...

136
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,119
whose murders
are all based on urban legends.

137
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,870
That's pretty cool.

138
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,874
But not exactly what we've come to
expect from a Mayfield.

139
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,278
I know, but I think I'm ready
for a work of fiction.

140
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,115
I think you are too. You mind, Richard?

141
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,680
You can get the door...

142
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,992
on your way out.

143
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,393
What do you think?

144
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,480
Horror or suspense?

145
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,873
A little bit of both.

146
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,639
Just like Hitchcock.

147
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,595
Hitchcock's themes might
serve you well.

148
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,597
Paranoia, fear of imprisonment,
wrong man accused...

149
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,072
how the lines blur
between fantasy and reality.

150
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,520
So you think it's okay?

151
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,874
It's great.

152
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,714
Travis Stark.

153
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,152
Who would've thought
you'd be the next Spielberg?

154
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,959
- Yeah, right.
- Come on.

155
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,157
Enjoy it.
Next year you'll be in the real world.

156
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,840
Here's to unemployment.

157
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,670
Here's to you for saving my ass again.

158
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,234
Two more.

159
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,156
Do I get a private screening
when I get back?

160
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,834
We'll have to see.

161
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,554
I worked my ass off on your film.

162
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,549
- And every film you've done.
- I know, and I love you for it.

163
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,390
Thanks.

164
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,312
Here's to loving me for it.

165
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,236
Drink up.

166
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,319
Don't you have a plane to catch?

167
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,159
Wasted is the only way to fly.

168
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,079
I've got to go finish working on my
film. So have a safe trip.

169
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,639
See you when you get back.

170
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,751
That guy's a real spaz.

171
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,511
You know, I'm a director too.

172
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,315
Really?

173
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,193
Directors make a lot of money?

174
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,276
Pretty much.

175
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,112
Then you won't mind paying for these.

176
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,235
Excuse me.

177
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,789
Excuse me.

178
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,520
Hello?

179
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

180
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,320
<i>911. Please state your emergency.</i>

181
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,552
I just woke up in a tub of ice...

182
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,360
<i>- Don't tell me. Your kidney's gone.</i>
- Yes.

183
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,037
<i>Honey, I got Princess Di on line four.</i>
<i>I got to go.</i>

184
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,356
What?

185
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

186
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,270
<i>So check it out.</i>

187
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,870
It's a tradition during finals week.

188
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,351
Everybody's up late studying...

189
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,271
and, at midnight, everyone
screams as a release of tension.

190
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,635
At the same time,
between midnight and 12:01...

191
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,230
a coed is brutally attacked.

192
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,396
Her screams go unnoticed, drowned out
by the screams of those around her.

193
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,275
True story, right?

194
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,790
Yeah, I heard it happened at Harvard.

195
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,320
No.

196
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,714
It's an urban legend.

197
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,871
Like that girl who eats a burrito
with the pregnant roach...

198
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,037
and the eggs hatch inside of her
nose?

199
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,640
Or like that girl who takes a bite
of a chicken sandwich...

200
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,232
and discovers that the mayonnaise
is really pus from a chicken tumor?

201
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,314
There's that guy who has crabs,
unzips his fly...

202
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,590
Okay!

203
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,837
You definitely have the idea.

204
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,078
But I have my thesis film.

205
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,800
There a role in it for me?

206
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,912
You can scream, can't you?

207
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,915
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

208
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,032
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

209
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,830
You guys scared the shit out of me.

210
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,638
We're movie monsters.

211
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,877
- Want to be the Count?
- The Count sucks.

212
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,390
Get it?

213
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,034
Travis Stark, film genius.

214
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,959
- What are you doing?
- Looking for her.

215
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,358
She was looking through the window.
Trying to get her mack on.

216
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,034
Totally.

217
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,190
Sorry.

218
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,232
Let's play hopscotch.

219
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,320
Anyway...

220
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,437
- Is this your thesis film?
- Yeah, but it's not done.

221
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,194
I'm sure it's a mess right now.

222
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,272
I wouldn't call it a mess.

223
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,593
Right. I mean...

224
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,470
I just got my script approved
for my film, and thought...

225
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,831
maybe you'd want
to take a look at it.

226
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,277
Why don't you come by Tuesday night
and we'll talk about it?

227
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,835
Okay.

228
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,634
I'll call you about it.

229
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,160
On the phone.

230
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,676
I hear cell phones
give you brain cancer.

231
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,996
That's an urban legend.

232
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,316
Too bad.

233
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,477
This is what we're going to film.

234
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,157
Here's a twenty. Go wash my car.

235
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,874
Go ahead.

236
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,869
You know he's a P.A.,
not a slave, right?

237
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,279
Same difference. The guy's applied
to film school three times now.

238
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,717
Well, there's this girl...

239
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,719
who's afraid of the dark.

240
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,799
She puts her hand down,
and if her dog licks her hand...

241
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,400
she knows everything's okay.

242
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,235
Can I be the dog?
Because I'm a great licker.

243
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,079
That's what Dirk told me.

244
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,590
So anyway, when she wakes up
in the morning...

245
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,397
she walks into her bathroom and sees
her dog hanging from the shower rod.

246
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,637
- And a message.

247
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,480
Latex and cornflakes. We can do that.

248
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,430
Latex and cornflakes? One call to my
old man, and we can go digital.

249
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,351
Digital sucks. Latex rules.

250
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,354
That's not what your god
George Lucas says.

251
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,271
Yeah, well, fuck George Lucas.

252
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,749
- You're going to Hell, man.
- I know.

253
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,475
I need to talk to you, Mayfield.

254
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,360
In private.

255
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,116
Be right back.

256
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,519
- Where were you?
- This is a nice script, Mayfield.

257
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,390
Nice horror script.

258
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,917
It seems similar,
but I'm going for a paranoid...

259
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,916
That is bullshit. Mayfield,
you stole my fucking genre.

260
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,000
- Trust me, I'm not stealing anything.
- Trust you?

261
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,357
Yeah, I should trust you.

262
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,678
To steal a Hitchcock from me.

263
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,840
Nobody is going
to steal a Hitchcock from me.

264
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,873
Especially you, little girl.

265
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,398
Find yourself another D.P.

266
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,957
Are you all right, Travis?

267
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,989
I got graded on my film today.

268
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,552
C fucking minus.

269
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,273
How could that happen?

270
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,037
So much for the Hitchcock.

271
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,238
You don't need that.

272
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,833
You're better than that.

273
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,999
You're the most talented filmmaker
at this school.

274
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,877
Amy, I have no money.

275
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,759
I have no connections.

276
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,352
I feel really awful asking this now...

277
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,872
but I'm kind of desperate.

278
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,754
Toby dropped off my crew today.

279
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,671
You know another D.P. I could use?

280
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,075
Yeah. His name is Simon.

281
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,472
He shot my film.

282
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,714
I can give him a call if you want.

283
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,633
It's going to be okay.

284
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,800
I'll see you.

285
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,396
Hey, guys.

286
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,239
- Anyone seen Sandra?
- Naked, you mean?

287
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,760
Anyone not seen her naked?

288
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,270
I heard that!

289
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,279
- Watch out!
- Oh, my God!

290
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,320
She's...

291
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,790
Oh, my God.

292
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,870
Got you.

293
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,033
She's one hell of an actress, ain't she?

294
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,040
Movie magic.

295
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,720
Oh, my God.

296
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,314
Was I in the moment?

297
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,389
What were you doing?

298
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,472
Rehearsing.

299
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,552
I got an audition to play a coma patient
on ER.

300
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,713
- With help from Graham's daddy.
- It was nothing.

301
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,913
Thank you, baby.

302
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,478
Let's go watch her clean up.

303
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,277
You hear a noise while you're in the
bedroom. You come in here.

304
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,473
The camera follows you from the doorway.
Comes in.

305
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,160
You see the dog, you turn...

306
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,319
you see the message, then the killer.
You scream.

307
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,274
And that's it. Got it?

308
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,430
Picture's up.

309
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,918
Everybody shut up! Picture's up.

310
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,556
Okay, roll sound.

311
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,080
- I'll see you later.
- Graham, hello!

312
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,839
Can you hold on a minute?

313
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,350
Speed.

314
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,596
Pardon me?

315
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,831
Is this the set of Amy Mayfield?

316
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,996
Yeah, I'm Amy.

317
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,399
Listen, I need a reservation
for two for tonight. 8:45.

318
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,512
I'm Schorm Jabuscko.

319
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,594
Travis says you need
director of photography.

320
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,712
Travis. Yeah.

321
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,754
Thank you for coming. Unfortunately...

322
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,872
this camera is all we have...

323
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,799
Schorm.

324
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,392
You can call me Simon.

325
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,956
Don't worry.

326
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,554
I bring my own.

327
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,238
This is my baby...

328
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,320
baby.

329
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,079
You know,
you're a very beautiful woman.

330
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,519
Well, you're pretty cute too,
camera boy.

331
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,231
If you were a girl,
I would definitely fuck you.

332
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,556
- Really?
- Yeah.

333
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,671
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, doll-face.

334
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,639
Can I give you a lift?

335
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,758
You already have.

336
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,353
Shit!

337
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,114
Jesus!

338
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,991
Idiot, Sandra. Idiot.

339
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,591
All right. Keys, keys. Where would I
be if I were keys? Keys, keys.

340
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,149
Goddamn it. Keys.

341
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,558
Hello. Where are you? Keys.

342
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,356
A mess.

343
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,512
Disgusting. Goddamn it.

344
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,309
Yes.

345
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,390
<i>Cut.</i>

346
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,230
- She sucks.
<i>- Urban Legends, scene 3, take 28.</i>

347
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,239
- Dog looks good.
- It does.

348
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,760
<i>Action.</i>

349
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,311
- You could turn it into a comedy.
<i>- Scene 3</i>

350
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,716
<i>Take twenty-fucking-nine.</i>

351
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,479
<i>Okay, action.</i>

352
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,794
<i>Cut. Please cut.</i>

353
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,990
What the...?

354
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,431
- This isn't us, is it?
- Wrong reel.

355
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,873
Oh, that's Sandra.

356
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,874
- What is she doing?
- That's Sandra's best angle.

357
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,600
That's definitely Sandra's ass.

358
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,560
Gratuitous ass shot.

359
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,793
Dude, that looks so real.

360
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,119
Right there. Get her.

361
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,431
They slash a major artery
and that's all the blood?

362
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,200
O.J. left more blood on the Bronco.

363
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,230
It was all right.

364
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,193
The dog was good.

365
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,836
Did you guys do this?

366
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,355
I didn't. Did you?

367
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,517
Simon?

368
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,995
No.

369
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,116
But I like it.

370
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,919
Where's the reel that was on this?

371
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,750
I don't know.

372
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,240
You swear you didn't do this?

373
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,875
Yeah, Dirk and I could do much better.

374
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,839
You don't think it was real?

375
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,589
No. Not enough blood.

376
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,033
Come on. This is classic Sandra.

377
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,830
- She probably staged it for her reel.
- Then, who shot it?

378
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,715
Guys. Travis Stark, he...

379
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,436
he's dead.

380
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,352
By now,
most of you have heard the news.

381
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,111
For those of you who haven't...

382
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,111
Travis Stark took his life
last night.

383
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,673
It's just hard to know what to say.

384
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,159
He blew his head off in the campus
tower. I mean, literally blew it off.

385
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,159
- Dental records wouldn't help.
- It's important for us...

386
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,953
to celebrate who he was...

387
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,915
and, what I believe,
he could've become.

388
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,711
He was a gifted filmmaker who raised the
bar for all of us.

389
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,315
But not only did he let himself down
he let us all down.

390
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,710
Everybody goes through a time when
they feel alone and helpless.

391
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,429
We need to go easy on ourselves...

392
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,673
and remember we're just doing
the best we can.

393
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,918
You know, in the movie
<i>Day for Night...</i>

394
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,397
Truffaut asked the question:

395
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,520
"Is film more important than life?"

396
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,637
He was a hell of a talent.

397
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,160
Are you okay?

398
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,790
No.

399
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,399
Have you seen Sandra?

400
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,397
Sandra's in a coma, Amy.

401
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,877
On <i>ER</i> in LA.

402
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,756
You should let me help you, too.

403
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,150
I know you're not hitting on me now.

404
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,071
With my dad's connections,
I can get your film done tomorrow.

405
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,632
I'd like to try it for myself.

406
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,231
That is hypocritical bullshit.

407
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,434
I know about you.

408
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,474
You're a Hollywood kid, like me.

409
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,837
What? I grew up in Chicago.

410
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,032
Not before 1992, you didn't.

411
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,593
You were 13 years old when you and
your mama moved from Beverly Hills.

412
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,790
After your daddy,
Taylor Mayfield died...

413
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,029
while shooting
the same nature crap that you do.

414
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,712
Don't look so surprised.

415
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,192
It's in your admissions file.

416
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,718
Being the daughter of an Oscar-winning
documentary filmmaker...

417
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,952
didn't hurt your chance of getting
into this school.

418
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,959
Why don't you cut
the girl-next-door crap?

419
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,193
You need to make it to save face...

420
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,119
just as bad as I do.

421
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,233
Maybe worse.

422
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,353
I'll see you on the set...

423
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,390
darling.

424
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,391
<i>I heard he blew his head off</i>
<i>up in the campus tower.</i>

425
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

426
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,151
Hello? Who's there?

427
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,676
Travis?

428
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,990
They told me you killed yourself.

429
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,520
You knew him?

430
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,876
What?

431
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,839
My brother. You knew him?

432
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,833
I don't understand.

433
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,999
I'm Trevor Stark.

434
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,473
I'm his brother.

435
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,871
I didn't know that Travis had a brother.

436
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,719
When was the last time you saw him?

437
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,677
I saw him a couple of days ago.

438
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,234
Was he upset?

439
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,076
He was depressed because of
the grade he got on his thesis film.

440
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,912
He thought he'd lost his chance
at the Hitchcock Award.

441
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,036
I thought that's why you...

442
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,880
he...

443
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,670
killed himself.

444
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,394
Is that what everyone thinks?

445
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,076
Wait. Please.

446
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,916
If you're not Travis, why are you here?

447
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,394
Please.

448
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,276
My brother didn't kill himself.

449
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,516
Trust me. He wouldn't do that.

450
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,399
What are you saying?
You think he was murdered?

451
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,080
I know that's what happened.

452
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,875
- Have you said anything to the police?
- I can't.

453
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,036
Why not?

454
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,590
I just can't. Listen...

455
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,277
don't tell anybody you saw me here.

456
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,753
Please.

457
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,036
Something happened to my brother,
and I'm going to find out what.

458
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,477
<i>Three, two, one, midnight.</i>

459
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,754
And cut.

460
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,280
Thank you so much. Thank you.
All right, we're done.

461
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,472
You can go home. That's a wrap.

462
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,957
- Sorry it was so late.
- What's going on?

463
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,151
Nothing.

464
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,433
There's something wrong.

465
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,838
Nothing. Just...
Hang on. Hey, guys.

466
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,993
I need help with these wild tracks.

467
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,115
Great. They're gone.

468
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,640
I'll do it.

469
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,470
No, I just need a wild track of them
screaming. Get some sleep.

470
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,353
- You sure?
- Yeah, I got it.

471
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,670
I'll talk to you later.

472
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,636
I must smoke.

473
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,876
I need a bunch of loud screaming.

474
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,431
You're a very beautiful woman.

475
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,634
Is that a Beaulieu?

476
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,599
A Bolieux.

477
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,109
Can I see it?

478
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,115
No.

479
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,999
Have a good night.

480
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,030
Okay, and rolling.

481
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,591
Now, remember guys: Nice and loud.

482
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

483
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,430
Help.

484
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,435
Help!

485
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,920
Help! Help!

486
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,280
Help!

487
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,476
And cut.

488
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,630
Help me!

489
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,359
<i>Hey, Foxy</i>

490
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,074
<i>Oh, Miss Foxy Brown</i>

491
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,150
Go, girl!

492
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,029
Scared me to death.

493
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,471
Have you been watching
these monitors?

494
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,040
Yes.

495
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,232
Are you signing my paychecks now?

496
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,917
I thought I heard someone screaming
like they were being attacked.

497
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,514
Anybody else hear them?

498
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,074
I had my headphones on.

499
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,359
I was recording screaming.

500
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,873
Let me get this, you were recording
screaming, then you heard...

501
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,912
screaming.

502
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,713
Your movie's making you paranoid.

503
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,715
Can we play the last hour
of these monitors?

504
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,520
Last hour?
Honey, I have rounds to make.

505
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,359
You think I just watch movies?

506
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,910
- Can I just borrow the tapes?
- Borrow them?

507
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,596
I'll bring them back. I promise.

508
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,430
All right.

509
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,439
If you see anything strange...

510
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,439
and I mean really strange...

511
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,635
you bring these back
to me to look at.

512
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,955
And start wearing a bell or something!

513
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,716
Stan?

514
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,270
That's not funny.

515
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,237
I'm serious. Stop it.

516
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

517
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,953
Goddamn it! Girl, this is getting old!

518
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,874
Somebody's after me.

519
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,514
How'd you find me?

520
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,996
You see? I do watch those things.

521
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,077
One tape was in my bag when I threw it.
I ran out of the scoring stage, but...

522
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,154
I had another tape. I dropped it.
Did you see it?

523
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,718
I looked, but I didn't see no tape, just
your crazy white ass down in the sewer.

524
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,151
I saw Simon killed. I saw the attack.

525
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,750
Look, honey, without proof...

526
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,036
This is proof.

527
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,754
Vandals.

528
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,029
Any overworked policeman
with a caseload a mile long...

529
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,550
is going to look
at this as vandalism.

530
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,833
Baby, trust me.

531
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,040
It's the way it is.
Let me take you home...

532
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,913
get out of them wet clothes.

533
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,116
And maybe I can go home.

534
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,075
<i>Hey, this is Travis. Leave it.</i>

535
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,397
<i>Hey, it's me, from the tower.</i>

536
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,072
I don't know if you're staying there,
but I need to talk to you.

537
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,273
It's about Travis.

538
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,239
I think you're right.

539
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,034
After I got away, I realized the footage
of Sandra was real. It wasn't a prank.

540
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,039
You think your friend Sandra
was killed as well.

541
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,914
Yeah. And that would've
been the third.

542
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,274
Have you told anyone else?

543
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,270
I was going to tell the police.

544
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,151
You can't tell the police.

545
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,470
Why not?

546
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,076
That's the second time you've said that.

547
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,800
Look...

548
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:31,958
Travis and I both had a certain amount
of creativity.

549
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,599
I focused mine on lesser pursuits.

550
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,716
And as a result, my relationship with
the authorities isn't that great.

551
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,474
But thanks to Travis, I'm starting to
get my shit together.

552
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,437
He was always riding me about never
following through on anything.

553
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,672
So I owe it to him.

554
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,634
You know?

555
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,430
Yeah.

556
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,993
Reminds me of my dad.

557
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,472
He was a filmmaker...

558
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,993
documentaries.

559
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,358
After he died...

560
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,469
I thought that if I didn't make
documentaries too, that I'd forget him.

561
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,150
But he'd be proud of me to know I'm
doing something I'm passionate about.

562
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,829
That's why I decided
to make this fiction film.

563
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,318
Not because I had any chance
at the...

564
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,155
The what?

565
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,517
At the Hitchcock award.

566
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,512
The winner's guaranteed a shot
at directing in Hollywood.

567
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,511
You think
somebody would kill for that?

568
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,200
Maybe.

569
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,836
Wait a minute.

570
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,913
Where's your shoot tomorrow?

571
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,231
It's at the theme park outside town.

572
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:56,236
Because if you're right, whoever's doing
this is going to come after you again.

573
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,393
This is our chance
to draw out the killer.

574
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,874
Trevor, I can't.

575
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,080
I know you're scared.

576
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,513
I mean, so am I.

577
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,198
But don't we owe it
to Travis and your friends?

578
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,555
I won't let anything happen to you.

579
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,554
I will be there.

580
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,234
Trust me.

581
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:37,031
<i>- I have a good story for you.</i>
<i>- Sandra's in a coma.</i>

582
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,913
<i>I heard he blew his head off.</i>

583
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,873
<i>Don't tell anybody you saw me here.</i>

584
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,635
<i>Latex and cornflakes.</i>

585
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,394
<i>- He was a talent.</i>
<i>- Don't act so surprised.</i>

586
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,956
<i>- So much for the Hitchcock.</i>
<i>- No one's going to steal it from me.</i>

587
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,760
<i>- Fantasy and reality.</i>
<i>- I'm good at that.</i>

588
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,232
<i>You need to make it to save face</i>
<i>just as bad as I do.</i>

589
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,715
<i>Tragic.</i>

590
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,479
<i>- Trust me.</i>
<i>- Paranoia.</i>

591
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,074
<i>I know about you.</i>

592
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,272
<i>- Fear of imprisonment.</i>
<i>- Not what we'd expect...</i>

593
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,392
<i>- Nice horror script.</i>
<i>- The wrong man accused.</i>

594
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,479
<i>- Especially you.</i>
<i>- My brother didn't kill himself.</i>

595
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,154
<i>Don't tell anybody you saw me.</i>

596
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,800
<i>- Trust you.</i>
<i>- Trust me.</i>

597
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,434
<i>Got you.</i>

598
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,914
Quite the artist. What are you guys
working on? Another urban legend?

599
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,430
"The Tunnel of Terror."

600
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,832
<i>A carnival comes to town.</i>
<i>Only, it's notlike other carnivals.</i>

601
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,676
<i>It has a Tunnel of Terror filled</i>
<i>with fake bloody corpses.</i>

602
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,594
<i>Everybody thinks</i>
<i>it's the scariest ride.</i>

603
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,111
<i>Then in the morning,</i>
<i>the carnival's gone...</i>

604
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,551
<i>and a bunch of children</i>
<i>are missing.</i>

605
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,636
<i>It turns out that the bodies</i>
<i>were real in the Tunnel of Terror.</i>

606
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,797
This is the Tunnel of Terror?

607
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,239
It will be.

608
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,280
<i>Hello, tenderfoot.</i>

609
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,399
<i>You must be as high as my tool</i>
<i>to ride the Merry Miners.</i>

610
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,750
I told you.

611
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,917
Whoo, suki suki now.

612
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,360
Dead bodies, anyone?

613
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,710
Oh, my God.

614
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,640
- So this is our Tunnel of Terror.
- You'll be able to make it work?

615
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,316
- We need three hours.
- You only have one.

616
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,517
- Perfect.
- Just negotiate.

617
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,393
- Wonder Twin powers...
- Activate.

618
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,153
Split it. Coming through.

619
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,876
Good luck, boys.

620
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,160
Sorry, baby.

621
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,359
Dirk! How you doing down there?

622
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,714
<i>Back to work, boys.</i>

623
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,070
Power's up.

624
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,150
<i>Take a look at these babies.</i>

625
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,751
Hurry back up here.
These things are creepy.

626
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,032
Scared of miners? Weak sauce, man.

627
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,760
Shut up and come up here.

628
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,989
I can't believe Simon flaked.

629
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,429
I can.

630
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,794
What happened to
good old Simon anyway?

631
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,519
What's he doing here?

632
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,072
Carrying shit. He wanted to help.
So what?

633
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,070
It's my crew. That's "so what."

634
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,591
I don't want all these people here.

635
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,879
<i>Take a look at these babies.</i>

636
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:58,313
This little piggy went wee-wee-wee all
the way home.

637
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,159
Nice, man.

638
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,592
You bring up the strobes?
Let me do this one.

639
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,519
Did you call me a ho?

640
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:11,556
Don't you think you're over your head
on this little masterpiece?

641
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,031
You pull a power trip on me
in front of everybody?

642
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,876
You shouldn't do that. You know?

643
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,600
Not to me, you shouldn't.

644
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,391
I'm out of here. Pack up this shit.

645
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,519
This will take a long time.

646
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,360
You guys go eat before
we get stuck here all night.

647
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,030
- You sure?
- Yeah.

648
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,512
I'll stay here.
Just come back in an hour.

649
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,554
Okay. I'll bring you back something.

650
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,559
All right. Guys, lunch. One hour.

651
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,799
Just be careful.

652
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,434
Always.

653
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,910
<i>The lights are in place.</i>
<i>How you doing?</i>

654
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,076
Everything's fine.

655
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,390
Let her rip.

656
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,592
- I'm about to go take care of my baby.
<i>- Use a rubber.</i>

657
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,357
Dirk and Stan, you read me?

658
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,078
<i>You okay in there?</i>
<i>Can you guys read me?</i>

659
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,397
<i>You coming in for a runthrough?</i>

660
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,474
Yeah, I'm coming now.

661
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,592
Okay, you push the red...

662
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,519
<i>No. No. Green.</i>

663
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,111
<i>Push the green button and pull the</i>
<i>pick ax. That should start the ride.</i>

664
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,277
<i>- Go for it.</i>
- Copy that.

665
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:56,159
<i>Howdy, tenderfoot, and welcome. Keep</i>
<i>your keister in the seat till the end.</i>

666
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,199
<i>Don't want to lose</i>
<i>any nuggets along the way.</i>

667
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,320
<i>So long, stranger.</i>

668
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,478
She's coming in for a runthrough.

669
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,636
Hurry up, man.

670
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,836
Hurry on up!

671
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,835
We outdid ourselves this time.
She's going to love it!

672
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,155
Coming up.

673
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,511
Okay, guys, very funny.

674
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,800
Guys, okay. I'm really scared.
Just stop.

675
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,637
Guys, are you okay down there?

676
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:56,516
Nice set. Where's your crew?

677
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,432
There's the two of them.
They were both electrocuted.

678
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,109
Stupid kids.

679
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,829
And that's your final statement?

680
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,356
Anything else you could tell us,
other than the power going out?

681
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,350
Anything else, sugar?

682
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:18,599
We can take it from here, detective.

683
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,236
No, there's nothing else.

684
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,871
Okay. We'll be in touch.

685
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,036
<i>Where were you?</i>

686
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,309
Is this what you call following
through?

687
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,718
You didn't do anything.
You didn't protect me.

688
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,432
That's not true.

689
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,519
I saw what happened with Graham.
That's why I followed him.

690
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,912
When I came back, the police were
everywhere. What happened?

691
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,756
Exactly what you said would happen.

692
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,839
He came back.

693
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,799
And now Dirk and Stan are dead.

694
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,520
Oh, my God.

695
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,239
I trusted you.

696
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,433
Amy, I'm sorry.

697
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,672
At least we know it's not Graham.

698
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,915
Not exactly. I lost him.

699
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,432
I'm wrong about everything.

700
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,110
Why?

701
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,274
Dirk and Stan were sophomores.

702
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,270
They weren't up
for the Hitchcock Award.

703
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,194
So why kill them?

704
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,270
I don't know what to do.

705
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,994
I'm so scared.

706
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,313
It's okay.

707
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,799
I'm here now.

708
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:02,830
Listen.

709
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,951
You need to get some rest.

710
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,153
Then we'll go to the tower
and start at the beginning.

711
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,592
You need to go to sleep.
You're exhausted.

712
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,920
- I know, but...
- You're exhausted.

713
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,351
Maybe there's something we missed.

714
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,117
Something that will help us.

715
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,360
Just don't leave me again, okay?

716
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,074
I won't.

717
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,079
I promise you.

718
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:12,550
Vanessa.

719
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,832
I got your note.

720
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:28,831
Let me just tell you
how I felt when I read this.

721
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,556
What?

722
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,839
At first I was a little surprised,
but...

723
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,838
you know, not really.

724
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,513
But I...

725
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,512
Vanessa, I didn't write a letter.

726
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,590
What?

727
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Oh, God.
Who would do this?

728
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,076
Come on, come on!

729
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,958
Amy, what's going on?

730
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,319
What are we running from?

731
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,955
What is it?

732
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,439
What is it, Amy?

733
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:52,916
Oh, shit.

734
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,554
Who the fuck's there?!

735
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,473
What the fuck's down there?!

736
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,592
Who is down there?!

737
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,429
Oh, rats.

738
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:31,996
Come on!

739
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,072
What's going on? Is it a joke?

740
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,351
No, it's not a joke.

741
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,999
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

742
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,392
What the fuck?

743
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,759
I don't hear anything.

744
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,312
Somebody help me!

745
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,118
What the hell?

746
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

747
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,633
Amy. What's wrong?

748
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,115
It's Vanessa.

749
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,433
- What?
- In the tower!

750
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,397
Why weren't you there when I woke?

751
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,634
Amy, I found something.

752
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:31,114
You've got to believe me.
Let's get out of here.

753
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,833
So I got to thinking...

754
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,836
if the killer wasn't killing off
the competition for the Hitchcock...

755
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,158
only film students,
there had to be a connection.

756
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,120
But I couldn't find one.

757
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,118
So then I took you...

758
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,394
out of the loop.

759
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:02,996
My brother's thesis film project.
All the victims worked on it.

760
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,434
Got it.

761
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,434
That was just awful.

762
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,717
How could Travis make
such a shitty movie?

763
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,353
I think I saw something.

764
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,957
- It's a splice.
- So?

765
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:55,915
It's a hard splice.

766
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:59,995
See, there's splicing tape connecting
the last frame of the film...

767
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,715
to the first frame of the credits.

768
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:05,389
- That's not normal?
- No.

769
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,556
This is a final print.

770
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,473
It's a copy from a negative.
You shouldn't see splices.

771
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:15,479
Somebody changed the credits
on Travis' film?

772
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,511
Somebody changed the film
on Travis' credits.

773
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,710
To pass it off as their own?

774
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,597
There's one person
on this crew who's still alive.

775
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,954
Oh, my God.

776
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>Gone with the wind</i>

777
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:04,035
Mayfield? What the f...?

778
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,079
Okay, okay.

779
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,870
What do you want?

780
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,920
Travis.

781
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,475
That should hold him.

782
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,113
What's the matter, Toby?

783
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:50,673
Looks like you've seen a ghost.

784
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,994
Professor Solomon.

785
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,669
Could you talk to them?
They have a gun...

786
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,189
Shut up!

787
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,120
Travis?

788
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,520
Professor.

789
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,440
But I thought...

790
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,950
Thank you for coming,
Professor Solomon.

791
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,679
Am I sorry.

792
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,553
Maybe you should sit down.

793
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,272
Pull up a chair, professor.

794
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,200
What's with the gun?

795
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,632
It's fake. It's a prop.

796
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,160
Oh, my God.

797
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,473
What's going on here?

798
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,357
Toby stole my film
and switched the credits on it.

799
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:55,599
Is that what this is all about?
Well don't flatter yourself.

800
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:00,437
Back up a step. Travis, why the
charade? I thought you were dead.

801
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,000
We'll get to that.

802
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,715
Toby's film was falling apart.

803
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,560
He knew mine was good,
because he did the sound on it.

804
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:12,357
No, I did not do the sound
on your film, you fake-suicide psycho.

805
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,677
You did it. You know that.

806
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,910
You gave me the credit
so I could graduate.

807
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,353
You never saw his film?

808
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,677
No, I never came near his film.

809
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,670
Professor, help me out here.

810
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,676
You realize what this means, don't you?

811
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,190
What?

812
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:39,275
I gave you an A in sound for nothing.

813
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,552
Film's a collaborative medium.

814
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:56,192
And who the fuck are you?

815
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,716
I put a gun in Travis Stark's mouth.

816
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,432
And I pulled the trigger.

817
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:08,550
Why?

818
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,600
Why?

819
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,230
To frame you.

820
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,359
As a matter of fact...

821
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:20,315
I need your prints on this gun
to prove you killed Toby and Travis.

822
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,079
And whoever this loser is.

823
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,153
Trevor, is it?

824
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:28,956
Cute.

825
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:36,310
Run, Amy!

826
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,630
Get up!

827
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,840
If you don't get out here,
I'll choke him!

828
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,310
Move.

829
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,798
Get out here
before you kill someone else.

830
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,239
Amy, don't come out.

831
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:18,999
True about twins? Did you feel it
when I blew your brother's brains out?

832
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,840
Guess it's going to hurt dying twice.

833
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:27,350
Let him go.

834
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,472
You got what you wanted.

835
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,800
You think this is what I wanted?

836
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,072
Fuck teaching!

837
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,639
What are you talking about?

838
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,637
When I was a student here...

839
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:49,590
the faculty was deadlocked
for the Hitchcock, between my film...

840
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,832
and a piece of shit by Chip Voelker.

841
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,150
So they asked a guest filmmaker
to cast the deciding vote.

842
01:26:58,880 --> 01:26:59,950
Taylor Mayfield...

843
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:02,516
documentary hack.

844
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,839
With that one vote...

845
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:10,279
your father robbed me of a career
I should've had in Hollywood.

846
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,760
And I've been trapped here ever since.

847
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:15,670
But then...

848
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,351
Travis made a brilliant film.

849
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,112
And I saw my way out.

850
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,511
But I needed an alibi.

851
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,196
Then bingo.

852
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:31,314
You walk in my office
with that twisted little movie idea...

853
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,916
giving me the cover I needed.

854
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,352
You killed everyone
who worked on Travis' film...

855
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,276
to pass it off as your own.

856
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,993
Hey, babe, whatever.

857
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,669
While you end up
in some lesbo prison...

858
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:49,430
I'll be heading to L.A. with Travis'
film and a 3 picture deal.

859
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:53,037
That only works in movies, idiot.

860
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:08,716
Freeze!

861
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,559
Oh, thank God.

862
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,993
- They were trying to kill me.
- He's lying.

863
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:16,356
First things first!

864
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,638
I want the girl to drop the gun
and kick it away!

865
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,190
But he's lying!

866
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,591
I said drop it and kick it away!

867
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,475
Thank you.

868
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:38,760
Now, everyone out
of the creepy-ass graveyard!

869
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,997
That includes the undead!

870
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,678
Professor, drop the shovel.

871
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,439
She's the one you saw coming
out of the tower.

872
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,996
- Don't listen to him.
- Cross to me, professor.

873
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,199
You're safe now.

874
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,198
It's true, isn't it?

875
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,040
I saw you leaving the tower.

876
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,116
Listen.

877
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,719
But I never told anyone I saw her.

878
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:15,640
Motherfucker!

879
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,391
You fucking son of a bitch!

880
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,840
Watch out!

881
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,705
Okay, everybody, calm down!

882
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,433
What do you say, hon?

883
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:58,839
Give me your best shot.

884
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,637
You filmed Sandra's death.

885
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,355
It's called "cin? Ma v? Rit?".

886
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,519
Nice touch, don't you think?

887
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:09,874
It was out of focus.

888
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:12,914
But you know what they say.

889
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,959
Those who can't do teach.

890
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:38,116
What are you going to do?

891
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,675
Come on.

892
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:47,310
Do it.

893
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,954
Pass it to me.

894
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:03,829
Oh, my God.

895
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,434
Thank God.

896
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:26,036
That's my sister, baby.
She's a whole lot a woman.

897
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,956
We need help at the film department.

898
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:39,591
It has been a year of pain
and tremendous loss.

899
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:44,000
And our final award is also tinged
with sadness...

900
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:46,954
for its recipient is
no longer with us.

901
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:50,713
We are fortunate, however,
to have his brother here...

902
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,270
to accept on his behalf.

903
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:57,790
We're proud to give this year's
Alfred Hitchcock Award...

904
01:31:58,160 --> 01:31:59,799
in memory of Travis Stark...

905
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:01,800
and <i>The Gods of Men</i>

906
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:21,911
Freeze!

907
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,672
You psycho motherfucker!

908
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:39,990
And cut.

909
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:47,434
- How many times we got to do this?
- Good. Print that.

910
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:50,838
We're going to do this one more time.
Back to one.

911
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,880
Let me give you a hand.

912
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,916
Listen. I am Amy Mayfield's agent.

913
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,874
We're not taking less
than a 3 picture deal.

914
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:07,360
- How am I doing?
- You're doing great.

915
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,960
You too.

916
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:10,435
Picture's up.

917
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,877
All right, let's try it. And rolling.

918
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,715
- Okay, let's get this.
- Soundspeed.

919
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:23,391
<i>Urban Legends</i> scene six, take two.
Mark it.

920
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,231
Don't you just love that movie?

921
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:42,235
I think we have a lot in common.
