2
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:05,615
This is where she did it.

3
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,385
Right here in this room.

4
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:09,754
The dorms were different
back then,

5
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:13,323
but the showers
have always been the same.

6
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:15,993
She ran a tap over her wrist,

7
00:01:16,027 --> 00:01:19,797
and then sliced it open
with a razor.

8
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:25,703
Then she lay her head back
and drowned in her blood.

9
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:26,804
They say her heart
stopped beating

10
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:29,774
at exactly 3:13 a.m.

11
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:32,542
Yvonne, what time is it?

12
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:36,379
3:12, one minute till.

13
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:40,383
I don't believe any of this.
Nothing's gonna happen.

14
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:43,654
Well, Kerrie, we'll know
soon enough, won't we?

15
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:46,891
It's exactly 3:13...

16
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:49,493
now.

17
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,596
Are you ready?

18
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:55,332
Edelvine ghost,
rise up to us.

19
00:01:55,365 --> 00:02:00,604
Edelvine ghost, rise up to us.
Edelvine ghost, rise up to us.

20
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,673
Aw, what's the matter, Kerrie?

21
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:05,009
Forget the words?

22
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,744
It doesn't matter anyway.

23
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:09,513
It should still work
for you all.

24
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,548
She's supposed to appear
behind you.

25
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:14,551
Do you see anyone else
in the mirror?

26
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:21,491
See? Told you it wasn't real.
It's just...

27
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,396
Did you guys hear that?

28
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:33,671
Hey.

29
00:02:33,704 --> 00:02:35,740
Is somebody there?

30
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:38,508
Alice? Don't.

31
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:41,444
Now let's get out of here,
please.

32
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:56,093
Funny.

33
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:58,062
Which one of you guys did this?

34
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,791
Oh, my God!
You guys fell for it completely.

35
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:28,860
You guys are fucking assholes.

36
00:03:28,893 --> 00:03:31,662
Oh, come on, Ros, even you can
admit that was a good one.

37
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:33,030
Oh, it was totally worth it.

38
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:34,732
You were in on this, too,
Bethany?

39
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:36,466
It was Bethany's whole idea.

40
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:38,169
Well, I mean, Alice came up with
all the good parts.

41
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:40,071
Well, partially I did, at least.

42
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:42,673
Hey, so, where did
Kerrie go anyway?

43
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,424
Who's there?

44
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:44,534
What now, Alice?
Another dumb prank?

45
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,603
No, that wasn't us.

46
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:49,874
Right. I'm going to bed.

47
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:53,110
You know what?
I bet you're half right.

48
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:54,679
Kerrie's screwing with us.

49
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,013
She figured it out,

50
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:58,481
and now she's just trying
to get back at us.

51
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:00,084
Come on.

52
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:07,792
Kerrie? Are you okay in there?

53
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:18,936
- Oh, my God.
- What?

54
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:24,507
Oh, my God.
Call... Call an ambulance.

55
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,735
Camille Meadows.

56
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:30,708
I see you've been at the top
of our wait list for some time.

57
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,276
You'll face a challenge

58
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,346
since our classes
are already underway.

59
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,715
As one of the higher-ranked
academies in the country,

60
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:39,616
our climate can be
quite competitive,

61
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,154
especially among seniors
like yourself.

62
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:45,956
Even girls who entered
as freshmen can sometimes

63
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,060
find the stress of their
last semester to be too much.

64
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:50,294
I've worked very hard to be

65
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,196
where I am right now,
Mrs. Landry.

66
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:53,931
That's good to hear.

67
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:55,933
It's fortunate that a space
has opened up for you

68
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:57,301
here at Edelvine.

69
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,370
Yes.

70
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,772
May I ask what happened?

71
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:05,776
A girl here died?

72
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,845
That's correct, I'm afraid.

73
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:09,914
A terrible accident.

74
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:12,783
Uh, one of our students slipped
and fell from her window.

75
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:15,086
The poor thing. Tragic.

76
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:19,156
Well, then, I'll have Helina,
our student aide,

77
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,958
show you to your room.

78
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:25,229
You sure you don't need
any help?

79
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:26,797
I got it.

80
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:28,866
Supper's in the dining hall
at 7:00.

81
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:30,801
You're gonna want to be on time.

82
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:32,336
The tables can be
a bit cliquish,

83
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,839
but I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

84
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,408
Curfew's every night by 10:00,

85
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:38,843
so make sure you're back
in your room,

86
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,411
in case Mrs. Landry
decides to check.

87
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:42,146
All that's in your
orientation pocket,

88
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:45,015
but it can be a lot to digest,
especially considering

89
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:47,852
I'm sure you already have a ton
of catch-up work to do.

90
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:52,323
This is your room.

91
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,272
The girl who died...

92
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:12,877
...this was her room?

93
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:17,882
Yeah. Kerrie Riley.

94
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,683
She lived here.

95
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:23,387
All the other rooms are full.

96
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,323
But, um, hey, why don't you
come find me

97
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:29,126
in the study lounge
once you've finished unpacking?

98
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,862
We could go over your
class schedule together.

99
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:33,998
I'd really appreciate that.

100
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:02,693
Perfect.

101
00:09:47,304 --> 00:09:50,040
Hey, this is our table.

102
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:51,475
Scram.

103
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,377
- Your table?
- Uh, yeah.

104
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,147
This is where we sit every day,
not you, whoever you are.

105
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,149
My name's Camille Meadows.
I'm new here.

106
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,819
I didn't ask,
because I don't care.

107
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,321
This is our table,
and everybody knows that.

108
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,924
Move.

109
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:10,527
- No, I'm good here.
- You're really not.

110
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:13,230
Look, um, I get that
you're new here,

111
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:14,865
so you don't know us yet,

112
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:17,268
but you really don't want
to get on our bad side.

113
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:18,969
Why's that?

114
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:20,504
You guys seem so nice.

115
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,940
Um, Camille.

116
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:24,308
Let's go sit somewhere else.

117
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:26,343
Oh, Helina's already
made friends

118
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:28,178
with the retarded new girl.

119
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,913
Why am I not surprised?

120
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:31,448
Shut up, Yvonne. I'm just...

121
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:35,119
Hey. What's going on here?

122
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:37,354
The new girl wants
to sit at our table.

123
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:38,922
It's true.

124
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:40,324
It's good conversation.

125
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:41,992
Sure.

126
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:44,328
I mean, we do have
an extra chair now, don't we?

127
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:46,196
And you already took
Kerrie's spot in school,

128
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,532
so you might as well take
her study lounge seat, too.

129
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,267
Thanks, Alice, but it's fine.

130
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:51,468
We'll just go sit
somewhere else.

131
00:10:51,502 --> 00:10:53,337
So...

132
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,406
What's your name?

133
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:56,974
Camille.

134
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:58,442
Well, I'm Alice.

135
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:01,145
And you've already
met Lenora and Yvonne.

136
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:03,213
This is Bethany.
And over here...

137
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,186
Oops. Oh, my God.

138
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:11,322
I am so sorry.

139
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:14,625
Looks like you're gonna
have to go get changed.

140
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:17,227
Go on, get the fuck out of here.

141
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:30,941
Stop!

142
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:36,547
Stop that immediately!

143
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,349
Ugh!

144
00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:41,518
All of you to my office.
This instant.

145
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,566
Are you certain
you don't want to tell me

146
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:58,335
who started this fight?

147
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:02,106
It was just
a little misunderstanding.

148
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:05,342
I can't say you're off to the
best start here, Ms. Meadows.

149
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:09,313
I hope you don't make me regret
our decision to enroll you.

150
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:12,416
Now, unless one of you girls

151
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:15,352
tells me who was responsible
for this altercation,

152
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:18,989
I'm afraid I will have no choice
but to punish you all.

153
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,929
Fine, then. You're dismissed.

154
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:07,971
Tomorrow's a new day.

155
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:12,677
You fucking joking?

156
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:17,474
Hi. I got a maintenance
request for this room.

157
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:19,610
- Just one moment, please.
- That's okay. I'll, uh...

158
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:31,154
Sorry about that.

159
00:14:31,188 --> 00:14:32,523
No problem.

160
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:35,793
So, you're the guy around here
who fixes stuff?

161
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:39,196
Yeah, I guess that's me.

162
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:43,100
Janitor, handyman, et cetera.

163
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:46,370
Uh, really just those two.

164
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:49,473
So, you put a request
in the maintenance box.

165
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:53,377
Yeah, that light
keeps flickering.

166
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,413
Or at least it was last night.

167
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:57,682
I'm new here.

168
00:14:57,715 --> 00:14:59,149
Yeah, I heard.

169
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:01,118
Uh, nice to meet you.
My name's Trevor.

170
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,319
Camille.

171
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,324
Oh.

172
00:15:07,357 --> 00:15:09,727
It must be the ghost again.

173
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:12,764
No, this building's supposed
to be haunted, you know?

174
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:15,867
Isn't every old school building
supposed to be haunted?

175
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,635
Yeah, each school probably does
have its own stories,

176
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,438
but this one especially

177
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:23,675
used to freak me out
when I was a kid.

178
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,442
You grew up around here?

179
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:28,612
I did. You've undoubtedly met
my mother, Mrs. Landry.

180
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:30,380
Your mom's the head mistress?

181
00:15:30,414 --> 00:15:32,115
Mm-hmm.

182
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,118
Yeah, she moved here to start
teaching when I was 5.

183
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:36,620
All my babysitters growing up
were students,

184
00:15:36,654 --> 00:15:40,357
so I know all the best
Edelvine ghost stories.

185
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,893
I, um...

186
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:44,294
I've got to go to class.

187
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:46,898
So I'll just let you...

188
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:49,166
Yeah, no problem.

189
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,301
Is everything else okay?

190
00:15:51,335 --> 00:15:53,705
Um, I think the window
might be loose.

191
00:15:53,738 --> 00:15:56,239
I kind of felt a little draft
last night.

192
00:15:56,273 --> 00:15:58,308
Okay. I'll take a look at it.

193
00:15:58,342 --> 00:16:00,644
Uh, I meant...

194
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:02,312
Oh, that's just...

195
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,817
- It's just an accident.
- Well, be careful out there.

196
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,151
Let me know if you need
anything else.

197
00:16:11,656 --> 00:16:14,358
In the Noh drama style,
women were barred

198
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,259
from participation onstage.

199
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:19,162
Their lead roles were acted out
by male performers

200
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:22,599
wearing masks,
not entirely unlike those

201
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:25,435
that you each designed
for yourselves.

202
00:16:27,504 --> 00:16:30,574
Camille, I was hoping
you could tell us the name

203
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:35,345
of the first acknowledged female
performer in English theater.

204
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:37,147
I'm not sure.

205
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:45,657
Margaret Hughes, who took
the stage on December 8, 1660.

206
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,557
This was in your reading.

207
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,961
I understand it will take
some time for you to catch up

208
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:52,429
with the rest of the class,
but it might help

209
00:16:52,462 --> 00:16:56,233
to keep your eyes forward
while I am speaking.

210
00:16:56,266 --> 00:17:00,337
Now, before we finish today,
as you recall, last semester,

211
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,308
you each submitted essays to the
Ivy Gate Fellowship competition.

212
00:17:05,342 --> 00:17:08,746
I am very proud to announce
that one of our own students,

213
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,348
Bethany, has won first place,

214
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:15,720
with a prize of a $250,000
college scholarship.

215
00:17:15,753 --> 00:17:17,955
- You didn't tell me that.
- Her winning essay will be

216
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:21,258
featured in the next issue
of the <i>Edelvine Gazette.</i>

217
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:25,228
And I suggest you all read it
to learn from her example.

218
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,267
Class is dismissed.

219
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,803
As for those of you
with detention,

220
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:35,372
Mrs. Landry has asked that you
meet her in the library.

221
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:39,877
In order to make our entire
storage collection

222
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:43,246
searchable online, a good deal
of archiving and scanning

223
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,882
will have to be done.

224
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:48,552
And I have decided that you
will all have detention

225
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:52,023
each and every day until
this project is completed

226
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:53,925
to my satisfaction.

227
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,393
I know you girls are dealing
with a lot right now,

228
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:57,929
but we do not tolerate

229
00:17:57,962 --> 00:18:01,431
any physical altercations
here at Edelvine.

230
00:18:01,465 --> 00:18:04,367
If you can all manage
to work together as a team,

231
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:06,838
I'm sure you'll get through
this quickly.

232
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:14,779
This is gonna take forever.

233
00:18:14,812 --> 00:18:17,581
- Thanks a bunch, new girl.
- Her name is Camille.

234
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:19,649
And also, how is
any of this her fault?

235
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:22,285
- You and Alice started it.
- I shouldn't even be here.

236
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,354
- I didn't do anything.
- Shut up, Bethany.

237
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:25,957
You just got a quarter-million-
dollar scholarship,

238
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,059
so you can stop freaking out
about your transcript.

239
00:18:28,092 --> 00:18:29,861
Whereas I have
a recital next week

240
00:18:29,894 --> 00:18:31,929
- I should be practicing for.
- Okay, well, you know what?

241
00:18:31,963 --> 00:18:33,664
I think we all should've gotten
a pass this semester

242
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:35,365
'cause of Kerrie.

243
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:36,901
Okay, I don't mean to be harsh,

244
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:38,903
but aren't you supposed
to get an automatic 4.0

245
00:18:38,936 --> 00:18:40,637
if your friend dives
out a window?

246
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:42,539
I think that's
only if you're roommates.

247
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:44,809
As much as I'd love
to spend my last semester

248
00:18:44,842 --> 00:18:47,611
listening to our complain,
I suggest we put all our

249
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:50,014
differences aside for now,

250
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:53,383
and like Mrs. Landry said,
get to work.

251
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,820
Agreed?

252
00:18:55,853 --> 00:18:59,090
I can start looking
for those books in storage.

253
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:00,825
If someone shows me
where that is.

254
00:19:00,858 --> 00:19:02,960
Yeah, I'll come with you.

255
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:09,801
Um, okay, next one is 115.25.

256
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,340
Okay, I'm gonna go
take these up front.

257
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:19,010
Um, you happy to start
on the next shelf?

258
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:20,477
Yeah.

259
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:57,715
Helina?

260
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Wow.

261
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,641
Well, if you can't have fun
in detention,

262
00:20:57,675 --> 00:20:59,542
when can you have fun?

263
00:20:59,576 --> 00:21:00,811
Hilarious.

264
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:02,113
Yeah, you like?

265
00:21:02,146 --> 00:21:04,181
We made masks of our faces
in theater tech.

266
00:21:04,215 --> 00:21:07,785
I did such a good job.

267
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:10,154
Can you even tell
I'm wearing it?

268
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,757
Oh.

269
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,659
Oh, hi, Helina.

270
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:17,460
We were just having fun
with your new girlfriend.

271
00:21:17,494 --> 00:21:19,130
You know, one of these days,
you two are gonna mess

272
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:21,032
with the wrong person.

273
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:23,901
Maybe.
Not today, though.

274
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:27,805
Oh, no.
Are you mad at us, Helina?

275
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:29,740
Oh! Boo-hoo!

276
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:39,649
Sorry about them.

277
00:21:39,684 --> 00:21:41,551
I'd say they're better
once you get to know them,

278
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:43,688
but they're not really.

279
00:21:45,756 --> 00:21:50,493
If anything, they've gotten
worse since, um...

280
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:52,730
since Kerrie died.

281
00:21:52,763 --> 00:21:55,565
Did you know her well?

282
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:58,135
Yeah, we used to be close.

283
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:01,638
My first year here, but, um...

284
00:22:01,672 --> 00:22:04,108
we... we grew apart.

285
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:06,243
Kerrie started hanging out
with Alice and the others,

286
00:22:06,277 --> 00:22:08,679
and then she just didn't have
time for me anymore.

287
00:22:08,713 --> 00:22:10,114
I'm sorry.

288
00:22:10,147 --> 00:22:12,883
Not your fault.

289
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:15,119
What happened, exactly?

290
00:22:15,152 --> 00:22:17,188
I'm sorry. No one's told me.

291
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:20,057
Some people think
it was an accident.

292
00:22:20,091 --> 00:22:21,993
I heard a rumor that
her parents want to reopen

293
00:22:22,026 --> 00:22:24,228
the police investigation.

294
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,596
What do you think?

295
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:28,666
I think it's easier to believe
almost anything

296
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:30,201
other than that someone
we were close to

297
00:22:30,234 --> 00:22:32,535
was in pain
and we didn't notice.

298
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:36,907
So, I-I don't know.

299
00:22:38,876 --> 00:22:42,246
Guess we'll never
really know for sure.

300
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:45,515
What if I told you
there's a way we can find out?

301
00:22:47,151 --> 00:22:49,687
What are you talking about?

302
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,156
Come, I'll show you.

303
00:22:55,826 --> 00:22:57,094
So, we've been talking
about doing

304
00:22:57,128 --> 00:22:58,996
something like this anyway,

305
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,266
and then Bethany found
this ritual online.

306
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:03,834
It's in Latin.

307
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:06,070
So, you're gonna do a seance.

308
00:23:06,103 --> 00:23:07,604
In here.

309
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,140
To contact your friend.

310
00:23:09,173 --> 00:23:11,909
This is really fucked up.

311
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:13,944
What is your problem, Helina?

312
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:16,013
If it doesn't work,
it doesn't work.

313
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:18,816
Worst-case scenario,
nothing happens, right?

314
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:20,351
And I mean,
don't you want to know

315
00:23:20,384 --> 00:23:22,953
why Kerrie did what she did?

316
00:23:22,987 --> 00:23:24,321
I'm in.

317
00:23:24,355 --> 00:23:26,757
Why not? Sounds weird.

318
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:30,728
Besides, I'm not working in here
while you all take a break.

319
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:35,032
Okay, fine. I guess if you're
all really doing this...

320
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:38,035
Grab a chair, then.

321
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:42,139
Where's, uh... what's her name?

322
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:45,276
Oh, Lenora said
she wasn't feeling great,

323
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:47,912
so we shouldn't wait for her.

324
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,949
There's someone
hiding in that corner.

325
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:54,718
- How... How did you...
- They're trying to scare us.

326
00:23:54,752 --> 00:23:56,687
Just play it cool.

327
00:24:11,802 --> 00:24:14,004
So, is this what you all do
for fun here?

328
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:16,807
To be fair,
we don't have a ton of options.

329
00:24:16,841 --> 00:24:20,077
Okay, then. Fine.

330
00:24:20,111 --> 00:24:21,946
How does it work?

331
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:23,814
Well, first,
you need a planchette,

332
00:24:23,848 --> 00:24:25,015
like a writing tool.

333
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:27,685
Alice had a great idea for that.

334
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,389
Neat, huh?

335
00:24:32,423 --> 00:24:37,194
Okay, so, we've got to
concentrate our energy

336
00:24:37,228 --> 00:24:41,332
and maintain contact
with the, um, planchette here.

337
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:43,134
You guys ready?

338
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:09,059
Is that it?

339
00:25:11,195 --> 00:25:14,832
So, what happens now?

340
00:25:14,865 --> 00:25:17,234
Wait, I guess.

341
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:18,936
- For how long?
- Wait.

342
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:21,238
Okay, I...

343
00:25:25,276 --> 00:25:27,011
Who's doing that?

344
00:25:31,248 --> 00:25:33,884
"Me."

345
00:25:33,918 --> 00:25:38,789
Okay. Spirit, is there anything
you want to tell us?

346
00:25:44,228 --> 00:25:45,229
Hold on. This is...

347
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:47,431
Shh! Ros.

348
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,268
"Ghost is real."

349
00:25:51,302 --> 00:25:53,504
What... What
is it talking about?

350
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:55,306
Oh, come on.

351
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:58,742
You didn't seriously think
this would scare us, did you?

352
00:25:58,776 --> 00:26:00,844
Quiet, Helina.
We're not doing this.

353
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:02,179
This is too weird.

354
00:26:02,213 --> 00:26:05,249
No, wait.
We shouldn't break contact.

355
00:26:05,282 --> 00:26:07,284
Seriously?

356
00:26:07,318 --> 00:26:09,153
Yeah.

357
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:11,121
We should keep going, right?

358
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,261
Spirit, with whom am I speaking?

359
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:28,505
Kerrie.

360
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:30,274
Is it actually her?

361
00:26:30,307 --> 00:26:33,310
- You all really are sick.
- What the fuck is going on?

362
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,847
I can't believe that even you
would sink this low for a joke.

363
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:47,391
Okay, what... what's
that supposed to mean?

364
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:50,227
W-Who is going to kill us?

365
00:26:53,497 --> 00:26:55,199
"She is."

366
00:26:55,232 --> 00:26:58,569
W-Who is she, Kerrie?
Who do you mean?

367
00:26:58,602 --> 00:27:01,171
- "Her?"
- She's talking in circles.

368
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:05,242
Maybe being a ghost
is confusing.

369
00:27:05,276 --> 00:27:07,444
"She is here."

370
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

371
00:27:28,365 --> 00:27:30,134
I...

372
00:27:37,207 --> 00:27:39,243
So, what was that in there?

373
00:27:39,276 --> 00:27:41,245
It seems like <i>you</i>
should tell <i>us.</i>

374
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:43,180
It was supposed to be a joke.

375
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:44,948
We were gonna move
the planchette around,

376
00:27:44,982 --> 00:27:46,383
draw a pentagram
with the lipstick,

377
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:48,385
and then Lenora was gonna
jump out and scare you.

378
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,487
Would have been really funny.

379
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:52,389
Yeah, it would have.

380
00:27:52,423 --> 00:27:54,591
But that wasn't us.

381
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:56,260
I honestly figured it was
one of you two

382
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:57,528
who was doing it at first.

383
00:27:57,561 --> 00:27:59,096
What, you really expect me
to believe

384
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:01,298
that we just talked
to Kerrie's spirit?

385
00:28:01,332 --> 00:28:02,499
I don't know.

386
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,902
I really did read
that incantation.

387
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:07,271
On the site where I got
the ritual, it said that

388
00:28:07,304 --> 00:28:09,173
you could only contact
the spirits of people

389
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:10,574
who died somewhere nearby.

390
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,077
We really did
the summoning, too.

391
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:19,083
The Edelvine ghost,
that night with Kerrie...

392
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:21,552
we said the words
at the right time.

393
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,923
The Edelvine ghost?

394
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:27,991
It's just an old legend.

395
00:28:28,025 --> 00:28:31,462
Some girl supposedly killed
herself in the dorms years ago.

396
00:28:31,495 --> 00:28:34,398
Story goes, if you call to her,
she appears, and then...

397
00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:36,600
- Then you die.
- Yeah, but it's not real.

398
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:40,037
And, I mean, no one's stupid
enough to actually try it.

399
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:43,540
Oh.

400
00:28:46,176 --> 00:28:50,013
The night Kerrie died, it really
was supposed to be a joke.

401
00:28:51,115 --> 00:28:52,616
Then she ran to her room,

402
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:55,986
and that was the last time
any of us saw her alive.

403
00:28:58,288 --> 00:29:01,492
Hey, so, I honestly couldn't
hear or see anything

404
00:29:01,525 --> 00:29:02,926
from over in the corner.

405
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,962
Can somebody tell me
what happened?

406
00:29:11,368 --> 00:29:12,670
Are you okay?

407
00:29:12,704 --> 00:29:15,072
I guess.

408
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:18,676
I mean, that had to just be
an awful fucking joke, right?

409
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,344
Maybe.

410
00:29:20,377 --> 00:29:22,079
They seemed pretty sincere.

411
00:29:22,112 --> 00:29:24,682
Yeah, they're good at that.

412
00:29:24,716 --> 00:29:27,651
It's the same joke they played
the night that Kerrie died?

413
00:29:29,754 --> 00:29:32,556
I just know I don't
trust any of them.

414
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,098
No idea how I meet these guys.

415
00:29:41,131 --> 00:29:43,500
Last guy who messaged me just
wanted pictures of my feet.

416
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:46,203
Uh, I'll just
catch up with you guys in a bit.

417
00:29:46,236 --> 00:29:47,571
- Okay?
- Are you sure?

418
00:29:47,604 --> 00:29:49,373
Yeah, it's cool.

419
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:30,748
What the...?

420
00:30:33,183 --> 00:30:35,118
Is somebody there?

421
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:38,656
Okay, come on, if this is
somebody playing a joke,

422
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,624
it's really not funny.

423
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:43,728
Fuck...

424
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:16,186
Camille?

425
00:32:18,322 --> 00:32:21,124
Um, yeah? Come in.

426
00:32:24,595 --> 00:32:27,164
Hey, um, I printed

427
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:28,866
those Renaissance notes
I was telling you about.

428
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,468
Oh, thank you.

429
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:34,471
That's really...

430
00:32:34,504 --> 00:32:36,874
super helpful.

431
00:32:36,908 --> 00:32:38,776
Thanks.

432
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,410
Helina?

433
00:32:42,412 --> 00:32:43,915
Do you mind me asking,

434
00:32:43,948 --> 00:32:47,317
the girl who lived here,
Kerrie...

435
00:32:47,351 --> 00:32:49,386
what was she like?

436
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:51,789
Are you worried your room
is haunted now?

437
00:32:51,823 --> 00:32:54,224
I don't know.

438
00:32:55,693 --> 00:32:58,595
My grandmother used to say
that if someone dies

439
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:05,235
in a really horrible,
like, bad way,

440
00:33:05,268 --> 00:33:08,171
the energy imprints
on the surroundings.

441
00:33:08,205 --> 00:33:10,574
And if you're sensitive,
you can pick up on it,

442
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:13,678
like playing back a recording.

443
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:18,750
Look, even if Kerrie was here
in some way, she...

444
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:25,222
Kerrie was a good person.

445
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:27,925
Okay.

446
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,663
Thanks.

447
00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:44,241
And a tendu, close.

448
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:46,343
Shape the arm, and in.

449
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:50,715
Dégagé, dégagé, piqué,
and close.

450
00:33:50,748 --> 00:33:52,950
Pas de cheval, and in.

451
00:33:52,984 --> 00:33:55,318
And side, and in.

452
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:57,521
And back, and in.

453
00:33:57,554 --> 00:33:59,757
And seven, and eight.

454
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:01,926
And a-one, and a-two.

455
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,728
Balancé, and four.

456
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:08,398
And five and six,
and developpé.

457
00:34:08,432 --> 00:34:10,802
Chassé, grand jeté.

458
00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:13,570
Yes?

459
00:34:13,603 --> 00:34:16,339
What?

460
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:18,575
No.

461
00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:21,244
No, she isn't.

462
00:34:21,278 --> 00:34:22,512
Hm.

463
00:34:25,817 --> 00:34:29,319
That's all for today.
Good work, everyone.

464
00:34:29,352 --> 00:34:32,757
Alice, Bethany, Yvonne,
Rosalind, Camille...

465
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,894
after you've changed,
please come see me in my office.

466
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:39,897
Camille, just one moment,
please.

467
00:34:43,835 --> 00:34:46,671
Your transcripts say you
undertook ballet at Brighton.

468
00:34:46,704 --> 00:34:48,039
Is that accurate?

469
00:34:48,072 --> 00:34:49,606
Of course.

470
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,341
Huh.

471
00:34:51,374 --> 00:34:56,047
I'm sorry. I... I didn't sleep
very well last night.

472
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,315
And I have cramps.

473
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:00,383
Ah.

474
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,854
I truly hope to see some
improvement from you shortly.

475
00:35:02,887 --> 00:35:04,756
Now go get dressed
with your friends.

476
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:07,257
They're not my friends.

477
00:35:15,465 --> 00:35:19,503
So, you're telling me that none
of you have seen or heard

478
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:21,906
from Lenora since supper
last evening?

479
00:35:21,939 --> 00:35:24,608
No, she wasn't at lunch
or in class.

480
00:35:24,641 --> 00:35:26,343
And she didn't say anything
about perhaps

481
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,478
traveling somewhere,
anything like that?

482
00:35:28,512 --> 00:35:31,916
I've been texting her all day,
but I think her phone is off.

483
00:35:31,949 --> 00:35:33,483
And I went to her room
before lunch,

484
00:35:33,517 --> 00:35:35,352
but her door's locked.

485
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:37,722
Yes, a staff member checked
Lenora's room this morning

486
00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:39,957
when she wasn't in class.

487
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:43,493
Almost all of her personal items
are missing.

488
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:45,629
We've spoken with her parents.

489
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:47,364
They're trying to locate
a young man

490
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:49,599
she's become acquainted with
online.

491
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:53,037
Wait, you think
Lenora ran away from school?

492
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,939
She would never do that,
Mrs. Landry.

493
00:35:54,972 --> 00:35:57,775
I mean, definitely not
without telling us.

494
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:01,545
Which is exactly why
I've invited you all here.

495
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:04,514
I can assure you that
any information given to me

496
00:36:04,548 --> 00:36:07,084
will be passed along
in confidence.

497
00:36:07,118 --> 00:36:09,754
Her parents just want
to know she's okay.

498
00:36:09,787 --> 00:36:12,056
- So do we.
- Yeah. This doesn't even...

499
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:15,726
Mrs. Landry, we honestly
don't know anything.

500
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,830
But I don't think Lenora
would just take off like that.

501
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:21,766
I can see that
we're getting nowhere.

502
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:25,468
But please, if any of you girls
should suddenly recall

503
00:36:25,502 --> 00:36:28,039
anything at all
regarding this matter,

504
00:36:28,072 --> 00:36:30,074
please let me know.

505
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:31,876
You're dismissed.

506
00:36:38,582 --> 00:36:40,785
Why are old people so stupid?

507
00:36:40,818 --> 00:36:42,653
Your brain cells die
after you turn 30.

508
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:43,921
I read that.

509
00:36:43,955 --> 00:36:45,823
There's no way
Lenora just bailed on us.

510
00:36:45,857 --> 00:36:47,758
Mrs. Landry said all her stuff
was packed and gone.

511
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:49,994
That's just not possible.

512
00:36:50,027 --> 00:36:52,163
Mrs. Landry's son, Trevor,

513
00:36:52,196 --> 00:36:54,832
he's like the handyman
around here, right?

514
00:36:54,866 --> 00:36:56,901
Would he have a key to her room?

515
00:36:56,934 --> 00:36:58,703
I guess so.

516
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:02,539
What are you doing?

517
00:37:02,572 --> 00:37:03,975
Texting him.

518
00:37:04,008 --> 00:37:06,010
How do you have his number?

519
00:37:06,043 --> 00:37:08,946
- He gave it to me.
- Well, that's just impossible.

520
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,449
Because he doesn't talk
to us students, like, ever.

521
00:37:13,684 --> 00:37:15,019
Great.

522
00:37:15,052 --> 00:37:17,454
He's gonna meet me in the dorm.

523
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:18,990
What's got you playing
detective?

524
00:37:19,023 --> 00:37:20,523
You don't even know Lenora.

525
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:22,126
Why do you care
what's happened to her?

526
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:26,563
I don't. But whatever it is,
I don't want it to happen to me.

527
00:37:26,596 --> 00:37:29,633
Come with us. Or don't.
Up to you.

528
00:37:51,923 --> 00:37:53,691
So, when you said
you wanted me to meet you here,

529
00:37:53,724 --> 00:37:56,794
that was kind of like
a plural "you," huh?

530
00:37:56,827 --> 00:37:59,664
Sorry. It's important.

531
00:37:59,697 --> 00:38:01,198
Well, it better be.

532
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:02,934
Could get in trouble for this,
you know?

533
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:06,804
We won't tell anyone.
We just want to see in her room.

534
00:38:25,022 --> 00:38:28,125
Her suitcase is gone.

535
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:31,561
Yeah, I assume that's the kind
of clue they'd look for.

536
00:38:31,594 --> 00:38:33,030
Seems like she packed
in a hurry.

537
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:34,865
Her room's always
kind of like this.

538
00:38:34,899 --> 00:38:36,934
There's a hidden space
behind the top drawer,

539
00:38:36,968 --> 00:38:38,501
in case you get a room search.

540
00:38:38,535 --> 00:38:39,870
You didn't see this.

541
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:41,571
I'm not even here.

542
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:44,675
I don't think she would leave
without this, would she?

543
00:38:44,709 --> 00:38:46,811
Can I see that?

544
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,182
Well, we should probably
get out of here,

545
00:38:51,215 --> 00:38:54,285
so if you're all finished...

546
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:56,087
Yeah, I guess.

547
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:02,760
Lenora made her bed?

548
00:39:11,202 --> 00:39:13,237
The police are on their way.

549
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,139
They've told me that
they'll have the substance

550
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:17,274
on Lenora's bed analyzed
to determine if there's

551
00:39:17,308 --> 00:39:18,943
any cause for real concern.

552
00:39:18,976 --> 00:39:20,177
Cause for real concern?

553
00:39:20,211 --> 00:39:22,113
Mrs. Landry,
our friend's disappeared,

554
00:39:22,146 --> 00:39:24,315
and there's a cross
drawn in blood on her bed.

555
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:27,051
As I said, Bethany,
the police are on their way,

556
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:30,154
and I'm sure they'll take this
quite seriously.

557
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:33,290
I, for one, just hope this isn't
a waste of their time.

558
00:39:33,324 --> 00:39:35,893
To me, this appears to be
exactly the sort of prank

559
00:39:35,926 --> 00:39:37,560
Lenora and you girls
love to play.

560
00:39:37,594 --> 00:39:39,864
- We wouldn't...
- We shall see.

561
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:45,202
As for you, Trevor,
we'll discuss this matter later.

562
00:39:45,236 --> 00:39:47,171
Wait for me at home.

563
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,942
Whatever's going on here,

564
00:39:51,976 --> 00:39:53,978
I'm sure there's no need
to impress upon you

565
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:57,081
how bad it would be
for rumors to circulate.

566
00:39:57,114 --> 00:39:59,350
If I hear any gossip
regarding this matter,

567
00:39:59,383 --> 00:40:01,952
I will know its source.

568
00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:03,586
The police will be here shortly,

569
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,122
and I will apprise
you of their findings,

570
00:40:05,156 --> 00:40:09,360
but if this turns out to be
one of your jokes...

571
00:40:09,393 --> 00:40:13,230
To that point, shouldn't you all
currently be in detention?

572
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:25,976
This is it.

573
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,945
I think I found her.

574
00:40:29,947 --> 00:40:32,883
Alicia Kane, daughter of
Noah and Ethel Kane.

575
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:36,253
Born February 24, 1982,
Gridley, Illinois.

576
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:40,758
Died October 13, 1998,
at Edelvine Girls Academy.

577
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:42,827
Funeral service will be held...

578
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,195
Is that it?

579
00:40:44,228 --> 00:40:46,097
They won't say suicide
in obituaries.

580
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,699
I wouldn't expect
any more details.

581
00:40:48,732 --> 00:40:50,234
How do we know it's her?

582
00:40:50,267 --> 00:40:51,769
We don't.

583
00:40:51,802 --> 00:40:53,671
But, um, I did
an obituary search online,

584
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:55,206
and this was the only listing
I could find

585
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:57,808
for a student who died here
at Edelvine.

586
00:40:57,842 --> 00:41:01,245
I mean, aside from Kerrie.

587
00:41:04,148 --> 00:41:05,950
1998, right?

588
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,666
- So, that's the Edelvine ghost?
- Wait, look at her necklace.

589
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:26,403
It's the same cross.

590
00:41:26,437 --> 00:41:30,640
That's her, but...
now what do we do?

591
00:41:45,723 --> 00:41:48,692
Better hurry, Ros. Past 10:00.

592
00:42:56,327 --> 00:42:58,963
Hey, someone's still in here!

593
00:43:02,132 --> 00:43:04,068
Assholes.

594
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,569
Shit.

595
00:45:50,702 --> 00:45:55,172
Excuse me, please, everyone.

596
00:45:55,205 --> 00:46:00,611
As some of you may have heard,
I have tragic news.

597
00:46:00,644 --> 00:46:03,681
One of your classmates,
Rosalind Carlisle,

598
00:46:03,715 --> 00:46:06,283
passed away tonight.

599
00:46:06,316 --> 00:46:09,319
I've just spoken to the coroner,
and it would seem

600
00:46:09,353 --> 00:46:12,956
that she somehow fell
in the shower.

601
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:17,161
For now, I'll ask you all
to please return to your rooms.

602
00:46:46,223 --> 00:46:49,026
Hey, Camille,
are you in there?

603
00:46:54,766 --> 00:46:59,069
Hey, um, I-I just heard
the awful news about Rosalind,

604
00:46:59,102 --> 00:47:01,472
and I wanted to, um...

605
00:47:01,505 --> 00:47:03,540
j-just check and make sure
you're okay.

606
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:05,609
Thanks.

607
00:47:05,642 --> 00:47:07,511
Yeah, I'll be fine.

608
00:47:07,544 --> 00:47:09,747
Are you sure?

609
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:14,084
I... I have some Xanax,
if you need anything.

610
00:47:14,117 --> 00:47:17,054
I-I've just been taking them
to sleep since...

611
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:19,623
Lately.

612
00:47:19,657 --> 00:47:22,259
No. Thanks.

613
00:47:22,292 --> 00:47:25,663
Okay. Um...

614
00:47:25,697 --> 00:47:27,732
Good night, then.

615
00:47:27,765 --> 00:47:32,469
Hey, um, do you want
to hang out here for a while?

616
00:47:52,724 --> 00:47:54,659
Rosalind.

617
00:47:57,394 --> 00:48:00,798
It doesn't make any sense.

618
00:48:00,832 --> 00:48:03,500
How so?

619
00:48:03,534 --> 00:48:06,637
For her to fall in the shower.

620
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:08,539
I mean, I know
stuff like that happens,

621
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:13,277
but, like, only
to really old people, right?

622
00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:25,757
Maybe I do believe in ghosts.

623
00:48:28,191 --> 00:48:32,262
There have been times in here
when I felt like someone

624
00:48:32,296 --> 00:48:35,532
was watching me,
but there was no one there.

625
00:48:35,566 --> 00:48:37,501
You know?

626
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:41,104
You're kind of freaking me out.

627
00:48:41,138 --> 00:48:44,709
Sorry.

628
00:48:44,742 --> 00:48:46,510
Me too.

629
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:50,147
I think I'm pretty high.

630
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:56,186
Hang on.

631
00:48:58,455 --> 00:49:02,225
I want to give you something.

632
00:49:02,259 --> 00:49:04,561
Camille, you didn't have to.

633
00:49:08,833 --> 00:49:12,169
Okay. What is it?

634
00:49:19,576 --> 00:49:21,511
Keep it.

635
00:49:22,714 --> 00:49:27,584
If anything scares you,
hit it in the skull.

636
00:49:27,618 --> 00:49:30,454
Don't you need it?

637
00:49:30,487 --> 00:49:32,589
No, I've got other stuff.

638
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:36,627
Okay. Um...

639
00:49:41,598 --> 00:49:43,701
Thank you, Camille.

640
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:54,211
No, Mom, I'm fine.

641
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:55,947
I'm just...

642
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,615
We're all just really upset.

643
00:49:59,884 --> 00:50:01,919
Ros was...

644
00:50:01,953 --> 00:50:05,255
No, no, I don't... I don't
need you and Dad to come here.

645
00:50:05,288 --> 00:50:07,792
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

646
00:50:07,825 --> 00:50:10,227
No, it won't affect my grades.

647
00:50:11,628 --> 00:50:14,598
I'll study, Mom, I promise.
Yes.

648
00:50:18,635 --> 00:50:21,773
I need to go to bed now, okay?
I'm really tired.

649
00:50:23,473 --> 00:50:25,242
You too.

650
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:27,712
Okay, good night, Mom.

651
00:50:31,783 --> 00:50:33,885
Good night, Mr. Bear.

652
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Wait, what?

653
00:50:57,742 --> 00:51:00,210
She was in my room.

654
00:51:02,412 --> 00:51:04,281
Check the closet.

655
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:06,583
O-Okay.

656
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:20,698
What's going on in here?

657
00:51:20,732 --> 00:51:23,500
We don't know.
We just got here.

658
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:25,402
She... She was right over there.

659
00:51:25,435 --> 00:51:27,905
Tell me exactly
what happened, Bethany.

660
00:51:27,939 --> 00:51:31,008
I... I heard a voice in my room,

661
00:51:31,042 --> 00:51:34,411
and it was the Edelvine ghost
looking right at me.

662
00:51:34,444 --> 00:51:35,847
And I threw my lamp at her...

663
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,816
The Edelvine ghost.
Not that nonsense again.

664
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:41,418
Think logically, Bethany.

665
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:43,755
Where were you
when you saw this ghost?

666
00:51:43,788 --> 00:51:45,489
You were asleep in bed.

667
00:51:45,522 --> 00:51:47,658
I wasn't asleep.
I'd just turned out the light.

668
00:51:47,692 --> 00:51:52,395
Bethany, you've had a bad dream.

669
00:51:52,429 --> 00:51:55,666
It's entirely understandable
under the circumstances.

670
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,869
I-I was wide awake. I swear.

671
00:51:57,902 --> 00:51:59,636
Everyone return to your rooms.

672
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:01,304
I know this has been
a terrible evening,

673
00:52:01,338 --> 00:52:02,673
but you need to get some rest.

674
00:52:02,707 --> 00:52:05,442
You can stay in my room tonight,
Bethany.

675
00:52:05,475 --> 00:52:07,477
That's okay, right, Mrs. Landry?

676
00:52:07,511 --> 00:52:10,681
Yes, fine. Just for tonight.

677
00:52:10,715 --> 00:52:14,484
Helina, what are you doing
on this hall after curfew?

678
00:52:14,518 --> 00:52:17,822
I-I was just making sure
that Camille was okay.

679
00:52:17,855 --> 00:52:19,957
What are <i>you</i> doing here,
Mrs. Landry?

680
00:52:19,991 --> 00:52:23,928
Rosalind's mother asked me
to pack up some of her things.

681
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:25,663
Her family will be here
tomorrow,

682
00:52:25,696 --> 00:52:27,765
and I've offered to help.

683
00:52:27,799 --> 00:52:30,001
Now, all of you,
back to your rooms.

684
00:52:30,034 --> 00:52:32,837
I just need to pack a bag,
Yvonne.

685
00:52:43,613 --> 00:52:45,817
I really think we need to tell
someone what's going on.

686
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:49,954
Tell them what? That we conjured
a ghost and now it's killing us?

687
00:52:49,987 --> 00:52:51,689
No one will believe it.

688
00:52:51,722 --> 00:52:53,758
Well, I'm not sure <i>I</i> believe it.

689
00:52:53,791 --> 00:52:56,526
Whatever was in Bethany's room,
she scared it off.

690
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,497
I just... don't understand that.

691
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,367
I guess it's difficult to say
why ghosts do what they do.

692
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:08,940
Are you two high?

693
00:53:11,809 --> 00:53:15,412
Where's Alice?
I haven't seen her tonight.

694
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:19,016
I don't know. I guess
she slept through everything.

695
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:21,752
Um, we shouldn't
wake her up now.

696
00:53:21,786 --> 00:53:23,486
I'll tell her in the morning.

697
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,522
Okay.

698
00:53:25,555 --> 00:53:27,591
Be careful.

699
00:53:27,624 --> 00:53:29,727
You too, I guess.

700
00:54:05,129 --> 00:54:07,798
Great, you're finally here.

701
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,802
We're gonna try
and contact Rosalind.

702
00:54:11,836 --> 00:54:13,536
What, right now?

703
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:16,207
We should do it when
her spirit might be near.

704
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,110
She could have a message for us.

705
00:54:19,143 --> 00:54:21,779
If you don't want to, fine.

706
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:37,995
Okay, so should we should all
focus our thoughts on Rosalind.

707
00:54:49,774 --> 00:54:52,043
Fuck off.

708
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,070
Rosalind? Is that you?

709
00:55:27,178 --> 00:55:29,646
Do you have a question for her?

710
00:55:34,551 --> 00:55:37,054
Rosalind, hey.

711
00:55:38,689 --> 00:55:40,891
We miss you.

712
00:55:40,925 --> 00:55:43,728
Rosalind, how did you die?

713
00:55:43,761 --> 00:55:45,863
What happened?

714
00:55:51,302 --> 00:55:53,070
"Murder."

715
00:55:57,074 --> 00:56:00,177
Did the Edelvine ghost kill you?

716
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,685
What does she mean?

717
00:56:09,687 --> 00:56:12,757
Rosalind, who killed you?

718
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,291
Was it...

719
00:56:20,931 --> 00:56:23,300
Camille?

720
00:56:23,334 --> 00:56:25,568
What the fuck?

721
00:56:25,602 --> 00:56:28,272
This is fucking bullshit.

722
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:31,709
One of you is doing
something to...

723
00:56:33,811 --> 00:56:35,246
Camille!

724
00:56:35,279 --> 00:56:38,716
Wait. Wait! Maybe Ros was saying
something else!

725
00:56:38,749 --> 00:56:41,819
Seemed pretty fucking clear.

726
00:56:41,852 --> 00:56:43,721
Are you fucking nuts?

727
00:56:43,754 --> 00:56:46,791
Stay away from me.
Get the fuck away from us.

728
00:56:46,824 --> 00:56:48,926
- We should tell someone.
- Tell them what?

729
00:56:48,959 --> 00:56:50,661
Look, I'm sorry, Camille.

730
00:56:50,694 --> 00:56:51,929
I admit, I don't know
what's going on here.

731
00:56:51,962 --> 00:56:53,664
And if I'm wrong,
then I'll apologize.

732
00:56:53,697 --> 00:56:55,332
But in the meantime,
I'm texting my friend back home

733
00:56:55,366 --> 00:56:57,600
and I'm telling her that
if anything bad happens to me,

734
00:56:57,634 --> 00:56:58,903
Camille Meadows did it.

735
00:56:58,936 --> 00:57:01,038
Yeah, good idea.
I'm gonna text my brother.

736
00:57:01,072 --> 00:57:04,842
Text the FBI for all I care.
I didn't touch Rosalind.

737
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:06,043
Why would I kill her?

738
00:57:06,077 --> 00:57:07,610
You got into a fight with her.

739
00:57:07,644 --> 00:57:09,914
I got into a fight with <i>you.</i>

740
00:57:09,947 --> 00:57:11,682
Is that a threat?

741
00:57:16,887 --> 00:57:19,256
You should text someone,
too, Yvonne.

742
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:22,026
Maybe we should call the police,
leave an anonymous tip.

743
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:25,129
That way, we don't have to
explain, just in case.

744
00:57:25,162 --> 00:57:27,965
Yeah, that's a good idea.

745
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,335
W-Where are you going?

746
00:57:31,368 --> 00:57:33,938
- I need to go to practice.
- Right now?

747
00:57:33,971 --> 00:57:38,275
Yeah, I-I just want to think
about some things.

748
00:57:38,309 --> 00:57:40,610
I'll catch up
with you guys later.

749
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:38,262
Who's in here?

750
01:00:16,433 --> 01:00:18,902
You?

751
01:00:19,169 --> 01:00:21,505
Go away.

752
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,809
You're not supposed to be
here anymore.

753
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:29,947
You're not alive.

754
01:00:44,528 --> 01:00:47,498
You're not supposed to be here.

755
01:00:56,907 --> 01:00:58,575
My room is definitely haunted.

756
01:00:58,609 --> 01:01:01,178
Can I sleep with you tonight?

757
01:01:01,211 --> 01:01:03,314
Um, yeah, sure.

758
01:01:17,494 --> 01:01:18,862
Thanks.

759
01:01:18,896 --> 01:01:22,066
Yeah. No problem.

760
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:25,602
I took a couple pills, so I'm
probably gonna pass out soon.

761
01:01:25,636 --> 01:01:27,404
Cool?

762
01:02:31,568 --> 01:02:34,204
What?
What the fuck, Yvonne?

763
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,647
Yvonne?

764
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:27,785
Where the hell are you?

765
01:04:33,223 --> 01:04:35,158
Lenora?

766
01:04:46,503 --> 01:04:48,272
What the...?

767
01:05:04,454 --> 01:05:06,557
Yvonne, what the fuck?

768
01:06:52,629 --> 01:06:54,732
She'll scream.

769
01:06:57,334 --> 01:06:59,871
No one can hear us
back here.

770
01:07:01,605 --> 01:07:03,373
Scream all you want.

771
01:07:07,444 --> 01:07:09,546
Fine. Suit yourself.

772
01:07:11,983 --> 01:07:15,585
There's not much need
for masks anymore.

773
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:17,354
I like wearing it.

774
01:07:17,387 --> 01:07:19,556
You two...

775
01:07:19,589 --> 01:07:21,959
killed Kerrie?

776
01:07:21,993 --> 01:07:24,327
Kerrie?

777
01:07:24,361 --> 01:07:26,263
Yeah.

778
01:07:26,296 --> 01:07:28,432
Yeah, and Rosalind.

779
01:07:30,367 --> 01:07:32,269
And Yvonne.

780
01:07:32,302 --> 01:07:33,403
And Lenora.

781
01:07:33,437 --> 01:07:34,604
Fuck this.

782
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:42,579
Oh, yeah. She's dead, too.

783
01:07:42,612 --> 01:07:44,982
Technically, uh,
I killed them.

784
01:07:45,016 --> 01:07:46,884
I-It's true.

785
01:07:46,918 --> 01:07:50,454
Kerrie?
Are you okay in there?

786
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:53,725
Trevor knows how to make
crawl spaces in these buildings.

787
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:57,829
He's been at it for years.

788
01:07:57,862 --> 01:07:59,797
Oh, my God.

789
01:08:05,402 --> 01:08:09,006
Oh, my God.
Call an... call an ambulance!

790
01:08:14,011 --> 01:08:16,313
Why?

791
01:08:18,548 --> 01:08:21,052
Did you hate them all that much?

792
01:08:21,085 --> 01:08:23,855
Yes, I did.

793
01:08:23,888 --> 01:08:28,693
But no, I only did it
because I had to.

794
01:08:28,726 --> 01:08:31,863
I honestly never expected
that scholarship essay to win.

795
01:08:31,896 --> 01:08:34,766
I didn't have time
to write my own,

796
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:38,401
so I just copied one of Kerrie's
depressing stories,

797
01:08:38,435 --> 01:08:40,772
just retyped it.

798
01:08:40,805 --> 01:08:44,374
When I found out it actually
won, I thought I was fucked.

799
01:08:44,407 --> 01:08:46,677
Not only would I lose
the scholarship,

800
01:08:46,711 --> 01:08:49,479
but I'd be expelled
for plagiarism.

801
01:08:49,513 --> 01:08:51,883
My whole life gone.

802
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:53,684
Unless...

803
01:08:55,953 --> 01:08:58,856
The problem was,
once Kerrie was dead,

804
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:00,792
I realized I had to kill
the others, too,

805
01:09:00,825 --> 01:09:02,994
because if they
actually bothered to read it

806
01:09:03,027 --> 01:09:06,429
once it was published,
they'd know it was Kerrie's.

807
01:09:06,463 --> 01:09:08,398
They could put it all together.

808
01:09:08,431 --> 01:09:10,802
So I just had to keep them
distracted.

809
01:09:10,835 --> 01:09:13,738
Enter the Edelvine ghost.

810
01:09:13,771 --> 01:09:16,339
The funny thing about
those pranks we used to play

811
01:09:16,373 --> 01:09:19,110
is that the girls were actually
very superstitious.

812
01:09:19,143 --> 01:09:20,912
So I moved the planchette.

813
01:09:20,945 --> 01:09:24,048
I put a magnet in my phone case
for the big stuff.

814
01:09:24,081 --> 01:09:27,584
And if I had been caught,
I would have laughed it off.

815
01:09:27,617 --> 01:09:29,352
But no one did.

816
01:09:29,386 --> 01:09:32,056
And after that, no one was
thinking clearly about anything.

817
01:09:32,089 --> 01:09:35,092
Trevor had already helped me
there before we even met.

818
01:09:35,126 --> 01:09:38,129
Didn't you, babe?

819
01:09:38,162 --> 01:09:40,131
Alicia Kane.

820
01:09:40,164 --> 01:09:42,900
She used to babysit me
when I was a kid.

821
01:09:42,934 --> 01:09:45,670
She was a real bitch.

822
01:09:45,703 --> 01:09:50,540
When I was 12, I snuck
into her room just to scare her.

823
01:09:50,574 --> 01:09:54,011
She really freaked out.

824
01:09:54,045 --> 01:09:56,948
So I hit her with my hammer.

825
01:09:56,981 --> 01:09:59,784
Then it wasn't too hard
to drag her to the bathroom,

826
01:09:59,817 --> 01:10:02,119
cut her wrists.

827
01:10:02,153 --> 01:10:06,057
I think my mom might've guessed.

828
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:09,160
I've been more careful
since then.

829
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:34,986
It was just a dream.

830
01:10:53,704 --> 01:10:55,206
When we found that
picture of her wearing

831
01:10:55,239 --> 01:10:57,975
that necklace,
Trevor had the idea

832
01:10:58,009 --> 01:11:00,577
to put the blood
on Lenora's bed.

833
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:03,214
Not many girls would appreciate

834
01:11:03,247 --> 01:11:06,717
someone with a unique mentality
like Trevor.

835
01:11:08,252 --> 01:11:12,056
We've had to keep our love
secret since my freshman year.

836
01:11:12,089 --> 01:11:14,591
But not much longer.

837
01:11:14,624 --> 01:11:17,695
Freshman year?

838
01:11:17,728 --> 01:11:19,730
So you were 14.

839
01:11:19,764 --> 01:11:20,932
Gross.

840
01:11:20,965 --> 01:11:22,499
Can I kill her now?

841
01:11:22,532 --> 01:11:24,467
Not just yet.

842
01:11:42,753 --> 01:11:45,555
It's for the medical examiner.

843
01:11:45,588 --> 01:11:48,726
While I'm here,
I might as well take this.

844
01:11:54,265 --> 01:11:57,702
Do you think I didn't see
your shoulders moving?

845
01:11:57,735 --> 01:12:01,538
Come on, it's amateur hour.

846
01:12:01,571 --> 01:12:04,709
Use this to kill Alice.
More evidence.

847
01:12:08,946 --> 01:12:11,849
God must truly be on my side.

848
01:12:11,882 --> 01:12:13,650
Right when I was trying
to figure out how I was gonna

849
01:12:13,684 --> 01:12:16,053
pull this off,
the weird new girl shows up,

850
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:18,990
picks a fight publicly
with all the victims.

851
01:12:19,023 --> 01:12:21,859
With Alice and Yvonne's
text messages about you,

852
01:12:21,892 --> 01:12:24,261
plus the evidence
we'll plant in your room,

853
01:12:24,295 --> 01:12:26,030
I don't think the police
are gonna look

854
01:12:26,063 --> 01:12:28,565
too closely at this.

855
01:12:28,598 --> 01:12:31,869
I mean, Helina might not buy it.

856
01:12:31,902 --> 01:12:34,105
But when she commits suicide
in a day or two,

857
01:12:34,138 --> 01:12:35,740
everyone will understand.

858
01:12:35,773 --> 01:12:37,274
It's just more tragedy.

859
01:12:37,308 --> 01:12:39,176
If you touch Helina...

860
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:40,945
You'll what?

861
01:12:40,978 --> 01:12:42,747
Be dead?

862
01:12:45,683 --> 01:12:47,550
This has been
tremendously satisfying,

863
01:12:47,584 --> 01:12:49,552
but it's time to wrap it up.

864
01:12:49,586 --> 01:12:52,189
Go ahead, babe. Alice first.

865
01:13:01,065 --> 01:13:02,233
What?

866
01:13:02,266 --> 01:13:04,835
Oh, you're so fucked.

867
01:13:04,869 --> 01:13:07,637
Hey, since you decided to frame
me for a series of murders,

868
01:13:07,671 --> 01:13:10,174
did you bother
to look me up at all?

869
01:13:10,207 --> 01:13:11,809
I did.

870
01:13:11,842 --> 01:13:14,011
And you're not on social media,
which is weird...

871
01:13:14,045 --> 01:13:17,948
But I bet you did find a
Camille Meadows, though, right?

872
01:13:17,982 --> 01:13:20,351
Lives in Florida,
gets good grades.

873
01:13:20,384 --> 01:13:23,054
Went to Brighton for ballet.

874
01:13:23,087 --> 01:13:25,990
You're not you.

875
01:13:26,023 --> 01:13:28,225
Hey, I'm a little lost here.
Can somebody loop me in?

876
01:13:28,259 --> 01:13:32,263
I don't get it. Why?

877
01:13:32,296 --> 01:13:35,733
I came to this school...

878
01:13:35,766 --> 01:13:38,302
to pay off a debt.

879
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:39,970
And how's that going?

880
01:13:43,374 --> 01:13:45,843
Could be worse.

881
01:13:45,876 --> 01:13:47,044
Where's the breaker?

882
01:13:47,078 --> 01:13:48,679
By the back door.

883
01:13:48,712 --> 01:13:50,114
Stay here.

884
01:13:57,421 --> 01:13:59,356
Hey, Trevor.

885
01:14:00,958 --> 01:14:03,994
Last chance.

886
01:14:04,028 --> 01:14:07,965
Untie me, and maybe you can go
to hospital instead of prison.

887
01:14:07,998 --> 01:14:11,669
Yeah, you know, my mother
sent me to therapy a few times.

888
01:14:11,702 --> 01:14:13,671
I always got along fine
with the therapists.

889
01:14:13,704 --> 01:14:16,006
Good listeners.

890
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,842
No, thanks.

891
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:21,812
I like it out here.

892
01:14:21,846 --> 01:14:24,715
I'm supposed to kill her first.

893
01:14:24,748 --> 01:14:28,219
Some forensics thing
Bethany's got figured out.

894
01:14:29,086 --> 01:14:31,255
But...

895
01:14:31,288 --> 01:14:34,425
you know, I bet
if I cut you now,

896
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:36,694
she'd make it work.

897
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:37,895
She always does.

898
01:14:37,928 --> 01:14:39,230
Hold on.

899
01:14:39,263 --> 01:14:41,298
Please don't do this.

900
01:14:50,407 --> 01:14:52,343
Hit him again.

901
01:15:00,317 --> 01:15:01,852
Good.

902
01:15:01,886 --> 01:15:03,954
Untie me.

903
01:15:05,189 --> 01:15:07,758
Are you okay?

904
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:09,727
I am now.

905
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,262
How'd you find us?

906
01:15:11,295 --> 01:15:13,397
I-I'll tell you later.

907
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:17,201
You're hurt.

908
01:15:17,234 --> 01:15:19,103
I'm fine.

909
01:15:19,136 --> 01:15:20,838
Did you call the police?

910
01:15:20,871 --> 01:15:22,373
No, I left my phone in my room.

911
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:29,880
Is she... Is she dead?

912
01:15:29,914 --> 01:15:32,850
No, she's just knocked out.

913
01:15:32,883 --> 01:15:34,451
Help me untie her.

914
01:15:36,921 --> 01:15:38,255
Okay.

915
01:15:38,289 --> 01:15:39,990
We're gonna have to carry her.

916
01:15:40,024 --> 01:15:42,393
Through the library.

917
01:15:52,069 --> 01:15:53,437
Hey, wait.

918
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:56,173
Where you girls going?

919
01:16:00,144 --> 01:16:02,846
Fucking useless.

920
01:16:57,868 --> 01:17:00,137
You can't run from me.

921
01:18:26,023 --> 01:18:29,259
You shouldn't have killed
my friend.

922
01:18:29,293 --> 01:18:31,929
Kerrie.

923
01:19:11,969 --> 01:19:14,071
Hi, Alice.

924
01:19:19,176 --> 01:19:21,211
What happened?

925
01:19:21,245 --> 01:19:24,515
Bethany and Trevor
killed everyone.

926
01:19:24,548 --> 01:19:27,518
So, there...
there wasn't a ghost?

927
01:19:29,153 --> 01:19:32,055
No, I think there is a ghost.

928
01:19:32,089 --> 01:19:35,225
The ghost just didn't kill
your friends.

929
01:19:45,335 --> 01:19:47,171
You're... You're alive?

930
01:19:47,204 --> 01:19:49,573
Careful.

931
01:19:49,606 --> 01:19:51,475
You have a concussion.

932
01:19:51,508 --> 01:19:53,544
You know, I think we all do.

933
01:19:53,577 --> 01:19:56,213
But can you walk?

934
01:20:02,286 --> 01:20:04,521
Is... Is Bethany...

935
01:20:04,555 --> 01:20:06,724
She's dead.

936
01:20:06,758 --> 01:20:08,459
I'm gonna need you both
to go back to the dorm

937
01:20:08,492 --> 01:20:10,027
and call the police.

938
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,562
Wait, you're not coming with us?

939
01:20:11,595 --> 01:20:13,530
Trevor's still back there.

940
01:20:13,564 --> 01:20:17,434
I'll tie him up and wait here
for the cops to come.

941
01:20:17,468 --> 01:20:20,204
I'll see you
when they get here, okay?

942
01:21:19,664 --> 01:21:22,834
You had to kill Bethany, huh?

943
01:21:22,867 --> 01:21:25,670
Literally the only girl
I ever got along with.

944
01:21:29,774 --> 01:21:32,242
There's nowhere to escape to.

945
01:21:34,645 --> 01:21:37,581
I already locked the back door.

946
01:21:37,614 --> 01:21:40,584
Doesn't matter
if your friends bring help.

947
01:21:42,887 --> 01:21:45,188
No one will get here...

948
01:21:47,224 --> 01:21:49,159
...in time.

949
01:21:58,803 --> 01:22:01,271
Hey. You under there?

950
01:22:11,481 --> 01:22:13,317
Aah! Aah!

951
01:22:22,326 --> 01:22:24,762
My leg. It's broken.

952
01:22:29,734 --> 01:22:32,402
Should've killed you earlier.

953
01:22:34,739 --> 01:22:38,375
Guess I'll be going
to that loony bin, after all.

954
01:22:38,408 --> 01:22:40,611
Maybe my mom can pull
a few strings,

955
01:22:40,644 --> 01:22:42,646
get me out in a couple years.

956
01:22:45,449 --> 01:22:49,553
How many friends did you have
growing up, Trevor?

957
01:22:49,586 --> 01:22:51,455
I don't know.

958
01:22:51,488 --> 01:22:53,858
I just had one.

959
01:22:53,891 --> 01:22:55,158
Whoa!

960
01:24:37,594 --> 01:24:40,230
I thought you might try
something like this.

961
01:24:51,408 --> 01:24:54,779
You killed him, didn't you?

962
01:24:54,812 --> 01:24:56,748
Of course.

963
01:24:59,717 --> 01:25:02,519
Alice told me what she heard.

964
01:25:04,354 --> 01:25:07,759
You... You did this
all for Kerrie.

965
01:25:07,792 --> 01:25:10,427
Kerrie and I grew up together.

966
01:25:12,529 --> 01:25:14,766
I owed her a lot.

967
01:25:18,602 --> 01:25:20,570
She killed herself.

968
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,843
I wanted to know why.

969
01:25:26,110 --> 01:25:28,813
I called the police.

970
01:25:28,846 --> 01:25:30,380
They're gonna want
to talk to you.

971
01:25:30,413 --> 01:25:33,617
Well, I might be hard to find.

972
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:36,788
I'm not Camille Meadows, Helina.

973
01:25:36,821 --> 01:25:39,957
I just used that name
to get in here.

974
01:25:39,991 --> 01:25:43,027
Now I'm done.

975
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:45,863
Gonna find another name
for a while.

976
01:25:47,698 --> 01:25:50,067
So, I'm sorry, but...

977
01:25:50,101 --> 01:25:53,671
I'm afraid you'll have to
explain things for me.

978
01:25:53,704 --> 01:25:55,706
What, so that's just it?

979
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:58,075
You're leaving?

980
01:25:58,109 --> 01:26:01,712
I mean, w-what am I supposed
to tell everyone?

981
01:26:01,746 --> 01:26:05,515
Tell them whatever
you want, Helina.

982
01:26:05,549 --> 01:26:07,484
I don't care.

983
01:26:10,054 --> 01:26:13,825
Then how will I be able
to reach you?

984
01:26:13,858 --> 01:26:16,694
I mean...

985
01:26:16,727 --> 01:26:18,830
if I wanted to.

986
01:26:41,018 --> 01:26:43,486
I'll find you.

987
01:26:50,995 --> 01:26:53,798
But I really have to go now.

988
