1
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,196
Tom, it's Robert.

2
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,831
I need you to fill in for me. Kate's gone
into labor and there are complications.

3
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,031
Mr. Thorn.

4
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,918
- Is she all right?
- She's resting.

5
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,116
And the child?

6
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,631
The child is dead.

7
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,513
She does not know.

8
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,838
It was everything to her.

9
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,717
A child.

10
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,439
Mr. Thorn, your wife...

11
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,638
There was damage to the womb.
She might not be able to...

12
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,154
She might not be able to what?

13
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,955
You love her very much.

14
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,278
Then you must accept God's plan.

15
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,189
He is quite beautiful.

16
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,273
I knew the mother well.
Healthy in every way.

17
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,313
- And the family?
- No family.

18
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,116
The mother died, as your own child...

19
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,236
in the same hour.

20
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,160
And our child...

21
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,279
May I see the body?

22
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,552
What's to be gained?
Give your love to the living.

23
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,358
For the sake of your wife, Mr. Thorn.

24
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,194
God will forgive this little deception.

25
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,352
And for the sake of this child.

26
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,837
On this night, Mr. Thorn,

27
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,474
God has given you a son.

28
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

29
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,231
Who's that?

30
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,310
That's our son.

31
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,231
He's perfect.

32
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,791
I love you.

33
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,070
I love you too.

34
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,359
No, it's good, it really is.

35
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,311
What is it?

36
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,471
Come on. Big blow.

37
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,835
Thank you so much.

38
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,029
Hi, Mike.

39
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,395
Afternoon, Mrs. Thorn.
How's young Damien?

40
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,948
He's fine.
Is my husband around?

41
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,110
Yes, ma'am. He's expecting you.

42
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,998
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Troy.

43
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,593
Hi, Steven.

44
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,148
- Hi, Kathy. It's great to see you.
- You too.

45
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,118
I've gotta run.
I'll let Robert tell you the good news.

46
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,918
- OK. Bye.
- Bye, Kathy.

47
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,036
What good news?

48
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,994
How was your Italian lesson?

49
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,750
That's very good. I'll have to remember that
next time my watch is stolen on a sailing trip.

50
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,910
All right. I'm on book one.

51
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,155
Well, the good news is that
you might not have to open book two.

52
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,354
Steven's been made
ambassador to Great Britain.

53
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,078
Wow.

54
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,230
That's great.

55
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,199
We're going with him, Kate.
He's made me deputy.

56
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,230
Oh, my God.

57
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,639
Robert...

58
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,109
London... That's wonderful.

59
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,636
I'm number two now.
I couldn't wait to tell you.

60
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,954
It's gonna be great, Kate.

61
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,671
What's going on up there?

62
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,349
Traffic.

63
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,669
Well? Do you like it?

64
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,317
It's big.

65
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,436
Big. Bad big?

66
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,875
Big big.

67
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,589
It reminds me of Steven's place in Italy.

68
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,630
What's that mean?

69
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,318
Nothing.

70
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,434
I thought you would like it.

71
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,510
Sorry.

72
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,515
Sometimes it feels
as if I'm stepping over Steven's corpse.

73
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,554
You got this job because you earned it.

74
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,437
Really?

75
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,752
Nothing to do with the fact
that I'm the president's godson?

76
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:12,436
Two senators and the president's sister
wanted that job, but he gave it to you.

77
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,909
What does that tell you?

78
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,070
That I love you.

79
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,835
- So we'll take it.
- Do I have a choice?

80
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,229
- No.
- Didn't think so.

81
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,075
It is big.

82
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,037
A little bit.

83
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,837
Hello?

84
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,709
Hello?

85
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,952
Damien?

86
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,629
Damien?

87
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,033
Damien?

88
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,032
No...

89
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,676
Damien... Damien.

90
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,589
Boo.

91
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,388
Don't... don't ever do that again.

92
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,948
Did I scare you, Mommy?

93
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,235
I didn't mean to.

94
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,355
I know.

95
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,319
I know. I'm sorry.
I was just worried about you.

96
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,875
- Ready? Come on, Damien, big breath...
- Three, two, one...

97
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,471
Great.

98
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,360
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

99
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,635
- I can take him.
- OK.

100
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,631
Thanks.

101
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,519
Damien.

102
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,154
Damien.

103
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,356
Look at me, Damien.

104
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,150
It's all for you, Damien.

105
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,349
It's all for you.

106
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,391
It's OK, pal.

107
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,310
It's OK.

108
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,596
Here he is.

109
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,068
- Have you read the papers today, Mr. Thorn?
- No, I'm afraid I haven't.

110
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,233
- There's an article about the suicide.
- I'm here to welcome the Saudi ambassador...

111
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,754
- Was she on drugs?
- Excuse me.

112
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,196
Will the suicide affect
your performance as ambassador?

113
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,192
Gentlemen, this way, please.

114
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,838
It's all right.

115
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,671
Are you OK?

116
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,679
I'm very sorry. Please, send me the bill.
I'll cover the charges.

117
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,957
It's all right, sir.
Let's just say that you owe me one.

118
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,757
Robert?

119
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,990
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

120
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,231
The tabloids are having a field day
with the nanny situation.

121
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,710
I know. Let it go.
It'll all blow over.

122
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,669
- I think we should issue a statement at least.
- Tom, please. Let it go this time, OK?

123
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,279
Excuse me, sir. A Father Brennan
is waiting downstairs at reception.

124
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,397
- Who?
- Father Brennan. The priest from Rome.

125
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,152
Did he say what it was about?

126
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,677
He called several times yesterday.
He said it was personal and urgent.

127
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,716
Want me to handle this?

128
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,951
No. No, I got this.

129
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,555
Father Brennan.

130
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,196
Robert Thorn.

131
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,753
What can I do for you?

132
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,559
We haven't much time, Mr. Thorn.

133
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,079
Time for what?

134
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,994
We must accept the Lord Jesus Christ
as our savior.

135
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,592
Accept him now.
Ask for his forgiveness.

136
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,231
Take Holy Communion, Mr. Thorn.
Drink of his blood, eat of his flesh.

137
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,713
For only when he is within you
can you defeat the devil's son.

138
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,351
I'm sorry, Father, I...

139
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,557
Accept responsibility, Mr. Thorn.
You did it.

140
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,870
You let them do it.

141
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,514
I think there's been some mistake...

142
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,273
He's killed before. He'll kill again.

143
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,148
He'll kill
until everything that's yours is his.

144
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,631
Forgive me, Father,
but I really should get back to work. Sorry.

145
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,068
I was at the hospital, Mr. Thorn.

146
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,750
The night your son was born.

147
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,478
I...

148
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,116
I participated.

149
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,752
I witnessed the birth.

150
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,597
I beg of you, please, Mr. Thorn.

151
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,240
What do you want?

152
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,232
I want to save you, Mr. Thorn.

153
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,550
So Christ will save me

154
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,837
and rescue me from eternal damnation.

155
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,036
What do you know about my son?

156
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,631
Everything.

157
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,510
I saw its mother.

158
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,834
- You saw my wife.
- No. I saw its mother.

159
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,911
You're referring to my wife.

160
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,072
Its mother, Mr. Thorn. Its mother.

161
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,357
- OK, that's enough. Sergeant...
- His mother is a jackal.

162
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,829
Yes, sir.

163
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,832
Everything all right, Mr. Ambassador?

164
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,469
Yes, Travis. Please escort
this gentleman out of the building.

165
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,549
Yes, sir.

166
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,556
You must accept the Lord Jesus each
and every day, Mr. Thorn. Drink his blood.

167
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,108
It is the only way, Mr. Thorn.

168
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,869
- How's the nanny search coming?
- Frustrating.

169
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,713
- No one you like?
- Not really.

170
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,759
- Well, maybe we don't need one.
- What does that mean?

171
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,549
Nothing. Just maybe we don't need a nanny.
You're not working...

172
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,598
I'm trying to raise our child. That's work.

173
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,797
I'm here with him every minute. You're not.

174
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,148
All I'm saying
is maybe we don't need a nanny.

175
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,312
Give you and Damien a chance to bond.

176
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,710
Now Damien and I don't bond.

177
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,553
That's not what I meant, Kate.

178
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,514
Can we start over, please?

179
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,954
I'm sorry you had a bad day.

180
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,030
Mine wasn't exactly uneventful either.

181
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,680
Can we call it a draw?

182
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,751
I'm sorry.

183
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,991
Come here.

184
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,671
- Hon?
- Yeah?

185
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,830
- There's something that I think I...
- Excuse me.

186
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,118
- Yes, Mrs. Horton?
- Mrs. Baylock is here.

187
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,154
I thought I was done for the day.

188
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,038
- Shall I show her in?
- Yes, please.

189
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,193
Good afternoon, Mr. Thorn.

190
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,111
- Hello.
- Pleasure to meet you.

191
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,589
- This is my wife Katherine.
- Mrs. Thorn.

192
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,114
- Please.
- Thank you.

193
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,553
If I may say, I realize
this must be a difficult time for you.

194
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,313
I'm genuinely sorry for your loss.

195
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,990
You know, sometimes the younger girls,
away from their families...

196
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,152
Well, the job can be hard on them.

197
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,114
But, you know, for me
caring for children has been the joy of my life.

198
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,239
I've really been so lucky.
I love my job.

199
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,555
I don't think I have your résumé.

200
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,991
The agency sometimes forgets,
with all the girls they send out.

201
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,389
This isn't the first time.

202
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,119
Here it is.
I sometimes bring an extra copy.

203
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,159
I've been raising children
for almost 40 years now, Mrs. Thorn.

204
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,119
I helped my own mother raise
my brothers and sisters - I was the eldest -

205
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,192
and I guess the habit sort of stuck.

206
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,512
I'm not the parent, and I never forget that.

207
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,114
But I am an extra pair of hands

208
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,513
and a responsible substitute
when you're out of the house.

209
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,599
May I see the boy?

210
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,268
He's beautiful.

211
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,319
I'll just be right back.

212
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,750
Hello, Damien.

213
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,115
I'm Mrs. Baylock.

214
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,030
Don't be afraid.
I'm here to protect you.

215
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,788
- Kate.
- I'm coming.

216
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,076
Mrs. Baylock?

217
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,272
Where's Damien? I asked you
to have him dressed and ready.

218
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,158
I'm afraid he's a bit under the weather.

219
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,150
He was fine a minute ago.

220
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,510
I was concerned about him last night.
He didn't sleep well.

221
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,353
I think he might
be coming down with something.

222
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,309
And it's such a long ceremony.
I really don't think it's a good idea.

223
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,276
Mrs. Baylock, have my son
dressed and in the car in five minutes.

224
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,717
What's wrong, sweetie?

225
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,355
It's just a church, that's all.

226
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,310
I know how you feel, kiddo.

227
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,789
Robert...

228
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,714
You OK, tiger?

229
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,390
Is he sick?

230
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,236
Damien, what's wrong?

231
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,359
Damien?

232
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,757
Damien, stop it.

233
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,357
Damien, stop it now.

234
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,112
No.

235
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,237
Damien, stop it.

236
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,595
Go. Drive the car. Go, now.

237
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,717
Home, please, David.

238
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,790
Hold still.

239
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,194
Maybe we should call a doctor.

240
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,396
No, it's not that bad.

241
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,709
No, I mean for Damien.

242
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,268
He's fine, Kate.

243
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,955
That boy has never been sick
a day in his life.

244
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,109
I know.

245
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,395
It's strange, isn't it?

246
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,710
What, that he's healthy?

247
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,590
It's unusual, Robert.

248
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,149
Other kids get colds, runny noses, the flu...

249
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,796
But Damien...

250
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,474
Nothing. Not once.

251
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,672
It's not just my imagination.

252
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,755
He's strange.

253
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,715
- It's...
- What?

254
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,271
It's different.

255
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,992
He's different.

256
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,238
Now why would you think
something like that?

257
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,432
He's just a little boy, Kate.

258
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,590
He got scared, that's all.

259
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,471
I'm gonna go to bed.

260
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,595
OK.

261
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,551
Easy.

262
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,318
Easy, boy.

263
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,236
Quiet down.

264
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,989
This is the master of the house.

265
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,432
Mrs. Baylock, what is this?

266
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Sir?
- This dog.
We found him outside.
- Who said you could bring a dog in here?
- I'm sorry, sir. Did he scare you?

267
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,989
- That's not the point...
- He'll be a good watchdog, sir.

268
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,232
Believe me, you'll be grateful
on those long trips away.

269
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,679
Mrs. Baylock, when and if we need a dog,
I'll pick one out myself.

270
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,751
Thank you.

271
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,912
Damien has grown quite fond of him, sir.

272
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,556
Tomorrow morning you'll call the RSPCA
and have him removed.

273
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,517
Do you understand?

274
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,598
Come on.

275
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,110
Good night, Mr. Thorn.

276
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,713
So, how's the new nanny working out?

277
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,110
She seems good.
But so did the last one.

278
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,676
I know the two of you were there
when the other girl...

279
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,072
With your kids. I hope they're OK.

280
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,197
- They're fine. Really.
- Yeah, they're fine.

281
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,273
Come along, children.
Stay close together.

282
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,634
Damien.

283
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,278
Damien.

284
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,599
Damien?

285
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,959
Hey.

286
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,711
Damien?

287
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,235
What's the matter? Those other kids
didn't wanna play with you?

288
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,349
They're afraid.

289
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,195
Let's go look at the birds.

290
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,838
Let's do that.

291
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,558
Hi.

292
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,790
Everything all right?

293
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,553
Yeah.

294
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,034
How's Damien?

295
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,149
What's wrong?

296
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,918
Did something happen today, Kate?

297
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,115
We went to the zoo...

298
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,268
with all the other children.

299
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,913
There's something about Damien.

300
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,436
He's so far away.

301
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Something's not right.

302
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,793
I must be a terrible person
for even thinking such things.

303
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,757
No. No.

304
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,910
Kate...

305
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,556
I need to talk to someone.

306
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,119
OK. OK.

307
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,155
What can I do, baby?

308
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,949
I need to talk to someone.

309
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,712
OK.

310
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,391
Tomorrow, Mr. Thorn. One o'clock.
Bishop's Park, by the bridge.

311
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,438
Just five minutes
and you'll never see me again.

312
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,274
Your wife's in grave danger.
She'll die if you don't come.

313
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,798
Damien?

314
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,835
Are you OK?

315
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,278
Damien?

316
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

317
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:47,273
All right, you've got your five minutes.
Now tell me why I'm here.

318
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,592
"When the Jews return to Zion
And a comet rips the sky,

319
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,834
When the Holy Roman Empire rises,
Then you and I must die.

320
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,550
From the eternal sea he rises,
Creating armies on either shore,

321
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,156
Turning man against his brother,
Till man exists no more."

322
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,834
You said my wife was in danger.

323
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,678
Go to the town of Megiddo
in the walled city of Jezreel.

324
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,194
There lives a man named Bugenhagen.

325
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,796
He alone can describe
how the child must die.

326
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,196
What child?
What are you talking about?

327
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:32,356
Your son, Mr. Thorn.
The son of the devil.

328
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,356
I came here
because you said my wife was in danger.

329
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,629
She's pregnant.

330
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,199
- That's impossible.
- That's what they told you, Mr. Thorn.

331
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,957
He will not allow the child to be born.
He'll kill it while it slumbers in the womb.

332
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,316
He'll kill the unborn child
and then he'll kill your wife.

333
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,631
And then, when he's certain
to inherit all that you have,

334
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,918
then, Mr. Thorn, then he'll kill you.

335
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,638
- That's enough.
- He has to die, Mr. Thorn.

336
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,439
You must act now, or all will be lost.

337
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:15,878
Go to the town of Megiddo.
See Bugenhagen, before it's all too late.

338
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,917
Now you listen to me.

339
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,835
I don't know who you are or what you want,
but stay away from my family. Understand?

340
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,469
I don't want to see
or hear from you ever again.

341
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,477
You'll see me in hell, Mr. Thorn.

342
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,799
We'll spend eternity together.

343
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,398
Damien, could you please stop that?

344
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,552
Damien.

345
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,071
Mrs. Baylock.

346
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,396
- What's wrong?
- That noise is driving me crazy.

347
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,789
Mrs. Baylock.

348
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,549
Yes, ma'am?

349
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,234
Could you please take him out of here?

350
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,709
He's playing quietly, Kate.

351
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,473
I said take him out of here.

352
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,629
Yes, ma'am.

353
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,998
Come along, Damien.
Mummy's not feeling well.

354
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,071
We'll go take a walk.

355
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,510
How's the therapy coming?

356
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,031
Can't you tell?

357
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,035
Dr. Greer wants to speak with you.

358
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,111
About what?

359
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,034
Kate?

360
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,839
We have a problem, Robert.

361
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,110
I'm pregnant.

362
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,592
What?

363
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,796
I'm having an abortion.

364
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,552
- Kate, listen, we should talk about this.
- No.

365
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,272
I am not having any more children.

366
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,396
I want it out of me.

367
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

368
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,637
Look, Mr. Thorn,
this session was Katherine's idea,

369
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,678
so I encourage you to speak freely.

370
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:22,437
Well, Kate's been under a lot of pressure
recently with our son Damien.

371
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,431
Things have been...

372
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,999
difficult.

373
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,959
I suppose that's why she doesn't like
the idea of having another child.

374
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,430
She's certainly having a hard time coping.

375
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,230
So much so that she's developed
what I call delusional rationalizations.

376
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,712
Like what?

377
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,790
Well, she fantasizes that Damien is evil,
for instance.

378
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,190
What do you mean, evil?

379
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,397
Forget about that, Mr. Thorn.
It's just a fantasy.

380
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,438
She also fantasizes
that he's not really hers.

381
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,358
- She told you that?
- It's just inside her head.

382
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,915
Do you believe in God, Dr. Greer?

383
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,831
Excuse me?

384
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,311
God.

385
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,591
Do you believe?

386
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:26,992
Mr. Thorn, my beliefs
really don't have anything to do with this.

387
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,076
Look, Mr. Thorn,
if you want to help your wife,

388
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,469
you really must consider an abortion.

389
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,120
We're not having an abortion.

390
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,428
We need this child.

391
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,034
Damien.

392
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,594
Damien...

393
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,829
please help.

394
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,075
- Ambassador Thorn.
- How is she?

395
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,790
She'll recover, but she has a concussion,
broken collarbone and internal bleeding.

396
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,429
- Internal bleeding?
- That's our biggest worry at the moment.

397
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,556
She's pregnant.

398
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,995
I'm afraid not.

399
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,273
She lost the child?

400
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,351
Yes.

401
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,952
Robert.

402
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,837
What is it, babe?

403
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,718
Please don't let him kill me.

404
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,510
What?

405
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,354
Don't let him kill me.

406
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,999
Hello?

407
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,197
Mr. Ambassador? My name's Keith Jennings.

408
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,750
- Who?
- I'm a photographer. You broke my camera.

409
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,909
- How did you get this number?
- No, no, please don't hang up.

410
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,675
This is not about the camera,
it's about you. And a priest.

411
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,149
A Brennan, a Father Brennan.

412
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:36,591
You were seen with him
moments before he was killed.

413
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,673
You see anything unusual?

414
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,032
- No.
- Look, here. Look. See?

415
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,838
There.

416
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:54,154
I know, I know. I didn't think much of it either
at first. Thought it was just a bad roll of film.

417
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,233
But then it happened again.
Here. You see?

418
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,390
That's on another roll.

419
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,519
And then again on the digital files.

420
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,751
There. That's digital.
That's another camera.

421
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,310
Here we go.

422
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,073
Our friend Father Brennan.

423
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,319
Look at this. Here.

424
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,634
And here's one I snapped ten days later.

425
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,517
- Same thing.
- Yeah.

426
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:38,628
Only much more pronounced on this one,
actually making contact with the body.

427
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,191
The rest...

428
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,275
of course, is history.

429
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,471
I know.

430
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,558
I didn't get it either.

431
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,916
Which is why I started digging.

432
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,629
The coroner's report showed
that Brennan was riddled with cancer.

433
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:11,114
He was high on morphine most of the time,
injecting himself two or three times a day.

434
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,760
- He knew he was dying.
- Apparently.

435
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,958
He said he wanted to be forgiven by Christ.

436
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,392
No atheists in foxholes, eh?

437
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,474
Here we go.

438
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:31,758
Now, externally
his body was completely normal -

439
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:36,470
apart from one small item
on the inside of the left thigh.

440
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,312
Here.

441
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,992
What is it?

442
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,548
That's three sixes.

443
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,200
Six hundred and sixty-six.

444
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,474
- A tattoo?
- No.

445
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,828
The biopsy showed that
that was a birthmark.

446
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,279
Come with me.

447
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,633
The best is yet to come.

448
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,192
He lived here?

449
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,313
Yes.

450
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,236
If you can call it living.

451
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:26,029
These are all pages from the Bible.
Thousands of them.

452
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,192
Every inch of wall space is covered.

453
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,559
And crucifixes...

454
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,200
Hundreds of crucifixes.

455
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:43,116
I'd say he was trying to keep something out,
wouldn't you?

456
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,636
He was obviously out of his mind.

457
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,790
Was he?

458
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,953
The first thing I found was his diary.

459
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,397
Only it's not so much about him
as about you.

460
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,118
And it's a little obsessive.

461
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,112
Notes on whenever you left the house,

462
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,875
where you went, where you ate,
your speaking engagements...

463
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,633
- Can I see that?
- Yes, certainly.

464
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:17,311
You'll see that the last entry says you were
scheduled to meet him in Bishop's Park...

465
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,956
the same day that he died.

466
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:30,430
However, the really interesting items are here.

467
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,308
If we're ever gonna get to the bottom of this,
this is where we begin.

468
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,279
The first is a clipping
from some astrology magazine,

469
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,749
a report of an unusual phenomenon.

470
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,149
It's a comet
in the shape of a glowing star,

471
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,959
much like the Star of Bethlehem
2,000 years ago -

472
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:51,797
only this one happened a little closer
to home, on the European continent,

473
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,030
just five years ago.

474
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,155
June 6, to be exact.

475
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,717
I assume that date rings a bell.

476
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,359
Yes.

477
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,191
Yeah.
Then you'll recognize the second clipping,

478
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,068
which is a birth announcement
from a newspaper in Rome -

479
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:25,551
again, five years ago,
sixth day, sixth month.

480
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,794
Was your son born at 6 A.M.?

481
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,070
My son is dead.

482
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,758
I don't know whose son I'm raising.

483
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:53,152
Well, if you don't mind, Mr. Thorn,
I'd like to try and help you find that out.

484
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,638
No.

485
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,636
It's my problem.

486
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:07,195
No. No, no, no, please, please.
You're wrong.

487
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,510
You see, it's also my problem.

488
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:16,638
See, when I first came into this room
with the police, I took a number of photos

489
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:22,033
and I happened to catch a reflection of myself
in this mirror here.

490
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,076
Take a look.

491
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:33,394
That's rather an unusual effect, isn't it?

492
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,991
All right.

493
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:48,113
Let's go. Get your stuff.

494
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,514
I'll be back as soon as I can.

495
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,439
I'm sorry, I have to.

496
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,238
No.

497
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,794
I'm so scared.

498
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,713
Kate, there's nothing to be scared of.

499
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,911
Nothing.

500
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,916
I promise.

501
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,311
That's not it.

502
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,558
It's the right address.

503
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:04,672
Apparently there was a terrible fire.
The old hospital burned down.

504
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,190
Five years ago.

505
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:16,159
<i>Molti morti-</i> many dead.

506
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:41,869
The fire started in the hall of records
in the basement.

507
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:46,750
It went up like a torch.
Shot up the stairwells.

508
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,917
The third floor became an inferno.

509
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,275
The third floor.

510
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,828
The maternity ward.

511
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:01,716
There was a priest.
A very tall man. He was in charge.

512
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,075
- Spiletto.
- Yes.

513
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,230
That's his name. That's him.

514
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,515
Do you know where he is now?

515
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,716
A monastery...

516
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,438
in Subiaco.

517
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,995
Subiaco.

518
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:05,198
I haven't found this poem you talked about,
but I have a good idea where it's from.

519
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:10,149
It seems to be a composite of prophesies
from the Bible, from Daniel, from Revelation,

520
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:16,554
whereby the time of the Antichrist
is heralded by the Jews returning to Israel.

521
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,676
That's the poem.

522
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,752
"When the Jews return to Zion",

523
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,116
and something about a comet.

524
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,270
That's here.

525
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,396
"A great star blazing like a torch
fell from the sky."

526
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:35,553
Now, these are signs,
together with the rise of the Roman Empire,

527
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,518
which signify the birth of the Antichrist.

528
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,592
As we know, the Jews have returned to Zion.

529
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:45,593
We've seen evidence of a comet.

530
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,910
The rise of the Roman Empire is...

531
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:54,916
The Treaty of Rome.
The European Union.

532
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,712
Revelation 13:
"And I stood upon the sand of the sea

533
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,268
and saw a beast rise up out of the sea."

534
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:07,478
That's the poem: "From the eternal sea
he rises, creating armies on either shore."

535
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,472
Now, the sea - bear with me -
the sea in this context

536
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,279
has been interpreted
as representing politics -

537
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:18,593
the sea which eternally rages with conflict,
with turmoil, with revolution.

538
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,875
Politics.

539
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:27,911
"From the eternal sea he rises" - the devil's
child shall rise from the world of politics.

540
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,348
They chose you, Robert.

541
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,357
Father Spiletto.

542
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:34,114
My name is Robert Thorn.

543
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,111
We met in Rome.

544
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,839
You remember me?

545
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,311
There was a child.

546
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,720
I need to know where he's from.

547
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,591
I'm afraid it's no use.

548
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,391
You said you knew his mother.
Where is she now?

549
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,954
- Please, sir.
- Where is she?

550
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,474
I must insist.

551
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,120
You confessed to them.

552
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,040
Now confess to me.

553
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,315
Where is she now?

554
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,351
Cervet...

555
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,592
- What does it mean?
- Cerveteri.

556
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:57,311
It's an old cemetery
from the Etruscan time.

557
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,229
Where is this place?

558
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,116
Where is it?

559
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,760
You'll find it on a map.

560
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,594
It is perhaps 50 kilometers north of Rome.

561
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,153
Robert.

562
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,231
Here.

563
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,391
Look at the date.

564
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:33,519
June 6, five years ago.
Mother and child.

565
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,794
"Maria Avedici Santoya."

566
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,351
Damien's mother.

567
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,592
But if that's her, then who's the child?

568
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,313
Hand me that iron.

569
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,989
Try to free up those edges.

570
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,511
It's coming.

571
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,272
What the fuck is this?

572
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,031
The priest...

573
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,596
He said its mother was a...

574
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,234
Was a what?

575
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:13,795
- The other one.
- What for? There's nothing there.

576
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:17,839
What if there is?
Maybe he's alive somewhere.

577
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:23,277
- Who?
- My son.

578
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,111
Oh, God...

579
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,311
They killed him.

580
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:48,118
They took him from her...

581
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,191
and they killed him.

582
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,035
Come on.

583
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,950
Let's go. Go.

584
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,631
Excuse me.

585
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:31,235
I'm the family nanny.
Here to spread a bit of cheer.

586
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:34,551
I just gave her her night-time meds.
She's barely awake.

587
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,189
I understand. I wonder if I could see her,
just for a few minutes?

588
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,430
No, I'm sorry, but I can't.

589
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:46,719
Her son picked these out himself.
He'd be heartbroken if she didn't get them.

590
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,950
I promised him.

591
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,713
I'm not sure if he should see her like this.

592
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,917
OK. I'll park him over here.

593
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,431
There you go.

594
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,795
I'll be back in a minute, sweetie.

595
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,191
Pretty.

596
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,951
Hi.

597
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,589
It's only me. Don't be afraid.

598
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:47,432
We have to find the town
Father Brennan mentioned.

599
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:52,115
- Megiddo.
- Right. I'll get hold of some maps.

600
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,670
Come on.
Come on, pick up the goddamn phone.

601
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

602
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,318
No...

603
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,113
No...

604
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,838
- No... No...
- Good girl.

605
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,190
Almost there.

606
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,752
Come along, sweetie. All done.

607
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,759
Hello?

608
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,229
Tom. Listen, I just tried...

609
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,956
Are you with Kate?

610
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,752
But I just...

611
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,198
No, she...

612
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,437
Look at his little hands.

613
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,558
Drink his blood.

614
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,269
What the hell happened to you?

615
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,834
Did you fall asleep?

616
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,194
Yeah.

617
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,797
No wonder you've been staying awake.

618
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,869
I found out about the town of Megiddo.

619
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:06,192
It's derived from the word "Armageddon" -
the end of the world.

620
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:10,239
It's underground,
just south of Jerusalem.

621
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:16,515
There's an excavation going on there -
some American university.

622
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,956
I don't suppose you remember that name?

623
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,590
Bugenhagen.

624
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,432
Bugenhagen?

625
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,270
That was his name.

626
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,668
I remember the poem, too.

627
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:40,550
"When the Jews return to Zion

628
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,791
And a comet fills the sky,

629
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:48,670
And the Holy Roman Empire rises,
Then you and I must die.

630
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:55,473
From the eternal sea he rises,
Creating armies on either shore,

631
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,313
Turning man against his brother...

632
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,272
Till man exists no more."

633
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,518
Kate's dead.

634
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,879
I want Damien dead as well.

635
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,952
Bugenhagen?

636
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,479
That little priest, Brennan.

637
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,070
Is he dead yet?

638
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,039
Yes.

639
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:14,036
Then we have work to do. Come.

640
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:35,877
It must be done on hallowed ground.
In the grounds of a church.

641
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:38,997
The blood must be spilled
on the altar of God.

642
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:43,870
Each knife must be buried up to the hilt,

643
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:48,033
and then set
so as to form the sign of a cross.

644
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,955
The first knife is the most important,

645
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,318
for it extinguishes physical life
and sets the center of the cross.

646
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:02,997
The subsequent knives extinguish
spiritual life and radiate outwards.

647
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,752
This is a child we're talking about.

648
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,229
A small boy
who I've raised as my own son.

649
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:13,791
He's not your son. He's a beast.
He's evil incarnate. Don't you forget that.

650
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:17,429
- What if you're wrong? What if he isn't?
- I'm not wrong.

651
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:20,080
- How do I know that?
- God, look...

652
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:22,799
He bears a birthmark.

653
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,670
A sequence of sixes.

654
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:30,833
So says the Bible.
As do all the apostles of Satan.

655
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:36,793
- No. He doesn't have it.
- He must have it.

656
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:41,715
I bathe him.
I know every inch of his body.

657
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,756
He doesn't have it.

658
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,356
If the sign isn't visible,
then it must be hidden beneath the hair.

659
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:51,796
Remove that, you'll find the number.

660
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,519
What about the woman, the nanny?

661
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:58,513
She's an apostate of hell.
She'll die before permitting this.

662
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,316
Kill him.

663
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:08,912
No.

664
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,039
No.

665
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:17,268
It's insane. All of you. You... Oh, my God.

666
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:22,673
Don't lose your nerve now, man.
We'll all be in the cesspool if you do.

667
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,595
Stop.

668
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:43,399
Thorn, stop.

669
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:46,074
You cant just walk away from this.

670
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:50,153
What the fuck did you think he was gonna
say? Why else have we come here?

671
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,993
He's a drunk.
An insane, delusional drunk,

672
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:57,232
who, like every religious fanatic,
thinks arcane scripture justifies killing.

673
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:00,392
What about me?
What about the photographs?

674
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:03,392
What if I'm next?

675
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:10,756
Listen to yourself.
Do you have any idea what you're saying?

676
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:18,680
You're asking me to stab a child.
A little boy.

677
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,719
Can't you see how insane that is?

678
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,917
It's not real, Keith.
There is no devil, there is no God.

679
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,276
There is only here and now, and life.

680
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:35,513
And that's something I would never take away
from any man, certainly not my own son.

681
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:39,038
Well, if you won't, I will.

682
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

683
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,310
No.

684
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:00,795
No.

685
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:54,199
No.

686
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:58,839
No. No. No.

687
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:06,472
No. No. No.

688
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,358
No. No. No. No.

689
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,556
No. No.

690
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:18,192
Our Father, who art in heaven,

691
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:19,998
hallowed be thy name.

692
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,479
No. No. No.

693
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:24,199
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

694
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:26,669
on earth as it is in heaven.

695
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:30,869
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,

696
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,758
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

697
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,751
And lead us not into temptation...

698
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,479
Please, Daddy, don't.

699
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,150
Stop.

700
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

701
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:08,596
Mr. President, your car is ready, sir.

702
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
