00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:12,667
<i>We interrupt this program</i>

3
00:01:12,669 --> 00:01:14,700
<i>to bring you
an important news bulletin.</i>

4
00:01:14,702 --> 00:01:17,799
<i>The Center for Disease Control
has recategorized the pandemic</i>

5
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:20,300
<i>first thought to be a super
virus strain of the flu.</i>

6
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:23,000
<i>It has now been determined

7
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:24,367
<i>seemingly capable

8
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:30,034
Have you got
your ticket for tonight?

9
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:31,999
Dad, I told you,
I've got work.

10
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:33,599
You deserve a break, love.

11
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:35,034
I don't need a break.

12
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:36,500
You won't be saying that
next year

13
00:01:36,502 --> 00:01:38,170
when it's wall-to-wall
lectures.

14
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:41,534
You heard back
from art school yet, John?

15
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:44,499
Uh, no, not yet,
Mr. Shepherd.

16
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:45,800
Is that normal?

17
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:47,700
- Dad!
- Sorry!

18
00:01:47,702 --> 00:01:50,133
I'm sure it'll be fine.

19
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:53,267
Hey, why don't you bring Anna
to the Christmas show tonight?

20
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:55,301
I'm working!

21
00:01:55,303 --> 00:01:58,033
So is he.
John, you tell him!

22
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:01,033
She can't, she's got to
pay off that ticket.

23
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:02,700
John!

24
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:04,300
What ticket?

25
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:05,599
You said, "Tell him!"

26
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:07,866
- I didn't say tell him that!
- What ticket?

27
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:09,367
- It's nothing.
- Anna!

28
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:10,666
I'll tell you about it later.

29
00:02:10,668 --> 00:02:12,367
What ticket, Anna?

30
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:13,336
Just...

31
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,435
I'm going on a trip,
all right?

32
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,201
- When? Where?
- Dad.

33
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:20,967
Well, I hope you checked when
university starts, because...

34
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:23,034
I'm not going to uni!

35
00:02:28,202 --> 00:02:30,499
I'm gonna travel first.

36
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:31,999
Just for a year, or maybe...

37
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:33,600
Don't be so stupid!

38
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:46,000
See you inside.

39
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:47,836
Thanks for the lift,
Mr. Shepherd.

40
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,699
You know this is
going to hold you back.

41
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:52,700
Where are you gonna go?

42
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:55,200
Australia first.
The ticket's open.

43
00:02:55,202 --> 00:02:57,101
Oh, well, that's all right
if it's open, eh?

44
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:58,532
Think of all
the beautiful places

45
00:02:58,534 --> 00:02:59,767
you could get
mugged or killed.

46
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:01,134
Stop trying to run my life.

47
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:02,500
I'm not
a little girl anymore.

48
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:03,799
Well, stop acting like one!

49
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:05,135
If your mother
could see you now...

50
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:08,466
I can't wait
to get away from you.

51
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:09,468
Anna.

52
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:14,266
<i>My parents went to Mexico,</i>

53
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:15,500
<i>so I'm all alone.</i>

54
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:17,100
I just thought
it would be nice

55
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:19,167
to spend Christmas
as a couple.

56
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,832
That's fine.

57
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:27,835
It's fine. Forget it.

58
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:36,836
My holiday
gift donation.

59
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:39,001
Wait!

60
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:40,036
Sorry!

61
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:43,602
Don't! I got it.

62
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:47,433
Do you need a hand
with these, Steph?

63
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,702
No,
my car's right outside.

64
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,502
I guess we're all having
a good day.

65
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:58,899
You all right?

66
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,933
Never seen your dad
like that before.

67
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:03,866
You think I'm doing
the right thing, yeah?

68
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,768
Yeah, it's great.

69
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:10,835
Anyway...

70
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:13,369
P.E. is calling.

71
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,135
Yeah!

72
00:04:20,502 --> 00:04:22,168
<i>More snowflakes!</i>

73
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,767
That picture's not straight.

74
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:26,003
Drawing pin
missing, bottom left-hand corner.

75
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:28,801
Miss North!

76
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:30,199
Dropped the homeless story.

77
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,466
It's editorial.

78
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:32,967
You can't do that.

79
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:35,366
It's a school blog,
Miss North, not <i>The Times.</i>

80
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:37,799
Council sets our budgets,
so we play nice.

81
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:40,167
Hopefully, get some
new computers.

82
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:42,366
With all due respect,
Mr. Savage...

83
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:44,134
I'm gonna go to Mr. Gill.

84
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:45,300
- Be my guest!
- Cool!

85
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:47,666
Headmaster Gill
is all but gone.

86
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:49,835
Come January,
this school is mine.

87
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:53,432
Oh. And as I told you before,

88
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:55,600
park your vehicle
on school property

89
00:04:55,602 --> 00:04:58,336
and it becomes
school property.

90
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,601
Give!

91
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:09,268

the world to be?

114

talented boy.

117
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:48,266

118
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:50,935

- Hey, Lisa!
- Oh!

145
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:37,600
What do you think?

146
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:41,001
It's like Narnia
threw up over Oz?

147
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,600
I know!

148
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:43,666
Hold still!

149
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:46,432
Four more cast members
called out sick.

150
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:47,767
So we're going to
have to change

151
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:49,433
the running order,
I'm afraid.

152
00:08:49,435 --> 00:08:53,766
Please try to remember that a
hand sanitizer is your friend.

153
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:55,335
Kissing on the mouth

154
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,168
is not...

155
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:00,135
Your friend.

156
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:03,001
You two!

157
00:09:03,003 --> 00:09:04,500
Why aren't you up on stage?

158
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,966
I'm not in the show.

159
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:07,401
Ah, Miss Shepherd.

160
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:10,833
Your father
is doing my lights.

161
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:13,967
When he has finished
cleaning the toilets,

162
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:15,433
would you send him
my way, please?

163
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,368
- That's not his job!
- Anna!

164
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:19,802
It will be soon.

165
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:23,199
Now where is my magician?

166
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:24,201
Here, sir!

167
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:37,533
I think it's about time we had a
little chat about health and safety.

168
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,669
Everybody up on stage, please.

169
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:41,766
Now!

170
00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:43,165
No, no, no!

171
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:52,569
Get back on stage this minute!

172
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:57,870
Flightless chancers!

173
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:18,600
You are such a child.

174
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:19,668
A sexy child.

175
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:23,367
Wait, no.

176
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:25,199
Goodbye, Nick!

177
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,668
Hey. Come on, come on.
Don't be like that!

178
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:28,835
Look.

179
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,265
If you wanna hook up

180
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:33,501
over the holidays, then...

181
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,799
Skip off.

182
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:52,532
Savage is losing it.

183
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:55,002
He made Henry Lee cry
'cause he can't breakdance.

184
00:10:56,435 --> 00:10:58,266
Henry Lee has a prosthetic.

185
00:10:58,268 --> 00:11:00,336
And he only has one leg!

186
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:02,432
Hey, guys!

187
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:03,468
Yay! Boyfriend!

188
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:21,133
Ignore him.

189
00:11:21,135 --> 00:11:22,834
Ugh. He's such a prick!

190
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:24,433
I mean, yeah,
he's got a body you could

191
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:25,767
- lick chocolate off but you'd have to have...
- Mmm-hmm.

192
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,669
...like, no self-respect
to even think...

193
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:31,666
I mean, um...

194
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:33,201
Not you, obviously!

195
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:34,802
The others!

196
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:37,333
Not that there's been loads,

197
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:39,734
you know, it's probably
all just rumors anyway.

198
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:41,666
I mean, love me!

199
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:42,869
Hey, guys!

200
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:46,266
Chris. Uh...

201
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:48,466
I need you to film something.

202
00:11:48,468 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah? Cool.
I'll film anything.

203
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,600
Savage keeps screwing
with the blog.

204
00:11:52,602 --> 00:11:55,599
So, um, I wanna bypass
the school completely

205
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:58,200
and do a video.
Uh...

206
00:11:58,202 --> 00:11:59,633
If we go to
the soup kitchen tonight,

207
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,866
I can have it in
before Christmas

208
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:02,999
and actually show people
we have a problem.

209
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,098
No! It's the Christmas
show tonight.

210
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,336
And I'm doing a special song
about Santa!

211
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:11,632
Our teacher said
you need something real.

212
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:13,435
Um... This is real.

213
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:18,834
I promise I'll make it back
for your song

214
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:20,666
and Gran will be there.

215
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:22,965
She's really excited
to see you, Lis.

216
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,099
All right.

217
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:25,068
Yeah!

218
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:27,832
Thank you! Thank you! Cool.

219
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:29,333
Yeah, um...

220
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:32,102
Let's see that asshole
try and stop this one!

221
00:12:35,603 --> 00:12:36,667
Uh...

222
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:37,769
Bye.

223
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:41,534
Oi, Annie Lennox!

224
00:12:41,536 --> 00:12:42,998
Right. I'm going over there.

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,332
Power down your lasers,
Iron Man!

226
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:48,866
He doesn't have lasers!
They're repulsors.

227
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,300
Well, Nick doesn't need help
being any more repulsive.

228
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:55,169
Plus, you know it's not like
you could actually do anything.

229
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:00,999
Hey, did you guys hear what
happened in science? Oh, my God!

230
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:03,132
Gemma Brand called Miss Hutchie
a Nazi, then got all upset.

231
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:04,500
She was sent outside,
'cause she thought

232
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:05,932
Nazi meant the same as OCD.

00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:50,132
I tried. My girlfriend
won't pick up.

303
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,365

are in Mexico, so...

304

from your weird-ass daughter.

miles away from here right now.

opportunity.

387
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:06,802
Sorry, Mrs. Hinzmann.

388
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:16,635
All right.

00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,132
Oh. John, wait.

Oh!

397
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:49,999
When I was little,

398
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:52,698
me and Dad
used to have competitions,

399
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,400
see who could
make the best one.

400
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,766
Mum would judge.

401
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:59,435
We stopped doing it
after she died.

402
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:03,265
What if Dad's right

403
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:05,935
and I'm just
screwing everything up?

404
00:24:06,634 --> 00:24:08,365
Look.

405
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:10,664
You're gonna end up
going to uni,

406
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,599
getting some fancy job

407
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:15,099
and having
a stupidly-successful life.

408

I'll come and visit you.

411
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,133
We can hike
across the Outback.

412
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:25,299
That's a pretty long hike.

413
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:26,799

00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:28,499

Mate! Mate!

00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,234

00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,033

that's perfectly normal!

this is happening.

you saw me with an inhaler?

00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:57,932
Don't have a go at me, just

00:30:57,934 --> 00:30:59,698

still working.

00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:42,968
Maybe it won't be so bad
across town.

524
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,967
Potassium.

525
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:02,466
It's okay.

526
00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:03,965
It's gonna be okay.

527
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:05,534
Our parents will know
what to do.

528
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,198
That's enough!

529
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,798
Now, even though we had
to spend the night

530
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,798
in the school, be assured,

531
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,132
the government
will sort all this out.

532
00:32:20,134 --> 00:32:24,001
We have an army base,
literally on our doorstep.

533
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,998
All that is required of us

534
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,298
is that we remain calm

535
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,099
and patient.

536
00:32:31,101 --> 00:32:32,831
If anyone has
any further questions,

537
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:35,398
I've set up temporary
office space over there,

538
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,334
adjacent to the fridge.

539
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:45,764
I'll get someone.

540
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:47,599
Doctors can't fix it, dear.

541
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:49,967
Don't think your teachers
could do much.

542
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:53,868
I'm just worried
about Christopher.

543
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:58,265
He's seen, like,
every horror movie.

544
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,601
He'll know what to do.

545
00:33:04,301 --> 00:33:05,632
Go.

546
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:08,864
See?

547
00:33:08,866 --> 00:33:11,599
- Told you it was them!
- Have you been bitten?

548
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:13,168
- Show me!
- They're fine!

549
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:17,833
Hey, guys!

550
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:20,466
Did you guys break in?

551
00:33:20,468 --> 00:33:23,501
Uh, the back door
was unlocked.

552
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:27,597
That's the cleaner's job!

553
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:30,366
Oh. Although, she might
have been concussed.

554
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,764
So, uh...

555
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:33,664
We were out filming
the soup kitchen last night.

556
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:34,798
It was really good,
and then we...

557
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,933
Then somebody screamed.

558
00:33:37,134 --> 00:33:38,268
Yeah.

559
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:41,366
Hey, zombies, right?
It's crazy!

560
00:33:41,368 --> 00:33:42,701
I know!

561
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:46,466
Excuse Anna.

562
00:33:46,468 --> 00:33:48,133
She's in Egypt at the moment.

563
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:51,331
Because she's so far
in denial!

564
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:54,798
You're not funny.

565
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,065
Oh!

566
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,498
- Boom!
- You guys heard anything?

567
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,798
<i>Further updates now on
the unfolding global crisis.</i>

568
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,331
<i>Reports of mass infection</i>

569
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,499

00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:08,665
- <i>Sources at the UN...</i>
- Whatever.

572
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:11,665
Big firm has been doing weird
shit for years. It's a cover up.

573
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,198
<i>...historic proportions.</i>

576
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:19,232
Yeah, once it's safe,

577
00:34:19,234 --> 00:34:21,197
we're supposed to go
to the school.

578
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,432
So the school's okay?

579
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:26,332
Yeah. And the army's
going to escort us out.

580
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:27,968
How cool will that be?

581
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,530
- Shit!
- What?

582
00:34:31,532 --> 00:34:34,665
Justin Bieber's a zombie!

583
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:39,700
Also, search "#EvacSelfie."

584
00:34:42,466 --> 00:34:44,098
- Look.
- Oh, no!

585
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:51,867
Well...
We all deserve to go extinct.

586
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:04,131
Oh! Bollocks!
He's definitely a zombie.

587
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:07,465
Robert Downey Jr. has,
like, a bazillion dollars.

588
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:10,164
He is in a hot tub right now

589
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,799
surrounded by electric fences

590
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:14,132
and models!

591
00:35:14,134 --> 00:35:15,932
Yeah, but,

592
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:17,664
it just takes
one personal trainer

593
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:18,797
with a bite and then...

594
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:20,500
Uh-uh.

595
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,298
Iron Man lives!

596
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,464
What about Ryan Gosling?

597
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:26,631
Doesn't matter.

598
00:35:26,633 --> 00:35:29,031
Alive? Dead?
The guy's still cool!

599
00:35:29,033 --> 00:35:29,998
Yeah.

600
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,500
Um... Taylor Swift?

601
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,232
Jesus, Chris!

602
00:35:37,234 --> 00:35:39,097
Why would you even say that?

603
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:40,465
Tay Tay's fine!

604
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:41,531
Yeah, all right, I was just...

605
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:42,701
She's fine!

606
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:45,967
Do you think
Paris is still standing?

607
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:48,531
Yeah.

608
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:50,430
French don't take no shit!

609
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:13,601
Mrs. Hinzmann?

610
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:18,198
Um...

611
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,335
No!

612
00:36:53,932 --> 00:36:54,933
They're inside!

613
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,700
- John?
- What do I do?

614
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,898
What do I do?

615
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,967
Destroy the brain
like in the movies!

616
00:37:33,432 --> 00:37:34,433
Get behind the table!

617
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:47,631
Go, on three!

618
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,033
Three! Two!

619
00:37:50,732 --> 00:37:52,530
I said "after three!"

620
00:37:52,532 --> 00:37:54,597
You said "on three!"
Think about your words!

621
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,966
"Think about your words!"

622
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:01,099
Fuck off!

623
00:38:02,901 --> 00:38:04,732
Fuck off!

624
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:06,201
Fuck off!

625
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,633
Can you...
Can you understand me?

626
00:38:22,034 --> 00:38:23,098
Okay.

627
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:35,598
Yeah! Boom!

628
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

629
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:27,631
Mr. Savage?

630
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:30,165
Is... Is there anything
we can give Bea?

631
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,965
Am I supposed to know
who that is?

632
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:35,500
It's just 'cause she's got
a bad heart, so...

633
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:38,467
Look around you, Miss Snow.

634
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:40,867
What do you see?

635
00:39:42,366 --> 00:39:43,367
Um...

636
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,664
Tables?

637
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:48,333
I see civilization
on the edge.

638
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,832
And what does civilization do

639
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:55,034
when it finds itself
on the edge?

640
00:39:56,466 --> 00:39:57,797
We help each other?

641
00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:03,766

- What's wrong?
- The snow's gone.

683
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:56,634
Fucking hell, Chris!
What about the army?

684
00:43:57,365 --> 00:43:58,666
See for yourself.

685
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:11,499
Everyone's dead.

686
00:44:14,701 --> 00:44:16,000
People will still be waiting
at the school.

687
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,364
We just need to get there.

688
00:44:18,366 --> 00:44:19,963
There's no evacuation coming.

689
00:44:19,965 --> 00:44:21,765
So, we'll get your car
and leave town.

690
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:23,297
And go where?

691
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:24,765
Well, I don't know yet, but
we'll figure something out.

692
00:44:24,767 --> 00:44:27,364
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

693
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:29,664
You can do anything.

694
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,032
I'm getting my dad,
all right?

695
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:35,131
Yeah, and my gran and Lisa.

696
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:38,197
I want to find
my mum too...

697
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:40,867
But how are we even gonna
get past all the zombies?

698
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,667
I've just had
the best idea ever.

699
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,964
This is the stupidest
idea ever.

700
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,698
We're all going to die.

701
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,363
We should play a game.

702
00:45:06,365 --> 00:45:07,466
Take your mind off it.

703
00:45:08,432 --> 00:45:10,698
Helps me when I'm carsick.

704
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,164
'Cause this is
exactly the same!

705
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,964
- Steph.
- Yeah?

706
00:45:14,966 --> 00:45:17,397
Um... Marry, shag, kill...

707
00:45:17,399 --> 00:45:20,864
Zombie Miley, Zombie Rihanna,
Zombie Beyonce.

708
00:45:20,866 --> 00:45:21,863
Kill them all,
they're zombies.

709
00:45:21,865 --> 00:45:23,033
No, play it properly!

710
00:45:27,132 --> 00:45:28,797
Marry Beyonce.

711
00:45:28,799 --> 00:45:30,665
- Why are you killing Rihanna?
- That's not what I said.

712
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:32,601
Well, obviously, you're shagging...

713
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:36,601
Is it a horde?

714
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,996
One, two, three.

715
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:42,164
How many is a horde?

716
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,132
Just check!

717
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:47,365
Shit.

718
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:49,530
I swear to God, if he says
it's snowing again...

719
00:45:49,532 --> 00:45:51,766
Uh, better.
Killer old people!

720
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:05,832
What the fuck?

721
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:21,598
Yeah, an old woman's
sitting on your face.

722
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,633
Oh.

723
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:29,131
Is she pissing?

724
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:30,465
You're fine.

725
00:46:30,467 --> 00:46:31,597
It's plastic.

726
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:32,866
It's warm plastic!

727
00:46:52,865 --> 00:46:53,866
Shit!

728
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:00,099
All right, losers.

729
00:47:02,732 --> 00:47:05,467
If you were going out,
should've brought some muscle.

730
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hi, John!
Hi, Nick.
Thought your big army dad
would have pulled you a favor
and shipped you out?

731
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,833
Don't talk about
my fucking dad!

732
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:18,497
Show some fucking respect.

733
00:47:18,499 --> 00:47:19,565
Says the guy
who just murdered

734
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:21,367
a whole bunch
of grandparents.

735
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:24,431
Actually,

736
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:27,097
can you get that on camera?
It's a bit of human interest.

737
00:47:34,765 --> 00:47:36,198
Ah.

738
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,667
You've been looting.

739
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,364
Lovely!

740
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:42,932
Where is your dad?

741
00:47:44,766 --> 00:47:45,833
He went to the base.

742
00:47:47,566 --> 00:47:49,031
Sorry.

743
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:50,799
Whatever.

744
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,467
Shit! Get back under!

745
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,200
Hiding's for pussies,
John boy!

746
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:01,966
We are hunters.

747
00:48:03,832 --> 00:48:05,797
All right, boys,
what do we have here?

748
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,763
- Are they, uh, excited?
- Yeah, mate. Use that.

749
00:48:08,765 --> 00:48:10,097
They're idiots.

750
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:11,999
So, yeah, probably.

751
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:13,299

Hey, so where are we going?

814
00:51:20,598 --> 00:51:21,800
Somewhere fun?

815
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:29,533
<i>People...</i>

816
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:32,334
People,
you have to listen to me.

817
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,829
We have to stay
in the school.

818
00:51:34,831 --> 00:51:36,163
You have to trust me.

819
00:51:36,165 --> 00:51:37,929
I've devised a 12-point plan.

820
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:39,630
Arthur. We're on our own.

821
00:51:39,632 --> 00:51:40,633
It's time to go.

822
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,297
We have emergency guidelines
in place for a reason.

823
00:51:45,299 --> 00:51:46,998
We have to hold out.

824
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Enough!

825
00:51:51,832 --> 00:51:54,297
If you love this place
so much,

826
00:51:54,299 --> 00:51:55,765
you're welcome to stay.

827
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:00,763
But I'm the headmaster.

828
00:52:00,765 --> 00:52:02,199
I'm the headmaster.

829
00:52:03,965 --> 00:52:04,866
I'm the headmaster.

830
00:52:07,832 --> 00:52:09,533
I'm the headmaster.

831
00:52:10,165 --> 00:52:11,166
I'm headmaster!

832
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:17,263
Come with us, Arthur.
You can help.

833
00:52:17,265 --> 00:52:19,363
Don't patronize me,

834
00:52:19,365 --> 00:52:21,632
you fucking janitor!

835
00:52:25,765 --> 00:52:28,496
After everything
I've done for you all,

836
00:52:28,498 --> 00:52:30,166
this is how you treat me?

837
00:52:54,865 --> 00:52:56,966
This is my school.

838
00:53:06,465 --> 00:53:08,831
Reckon they'll use our stuff
on the news?

839
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:10,766
It'll make my gran so happy.

840
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,633
That's weird,
isn't it?

841
00:53:15,598 --> 00:53:17,165
I mean, like...

842
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:20,331
You hear about riots and
revolutions in other countries,

843
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,796
but not here.

844
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,098
We could die!

845
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,131
Hey!

846
00:53:24,133 --> 00:53:25,633
Well, we could, though.

847
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:30,100
At least you won't be going
anywhere anymore,

848
00:53:30,798 --> 00:53:32,297
so that's something.

849
00:53:32,299 --> 00:53:33,300
What does that mean?

850
00:53:34,865 --> 00:53:36,497
Well...

851
00:53:36,499 --> 00:53:38,296
It's different now.

852
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,699
You can't just leave.

853
00:53:46,465 --> 00:53:48,499
John, you're my best friend,
yeah?

854
00:53:49,498 --> 00:53:50,499
You know that.

855
00:53:51,531 --> 00:53:52,632
Of course.

856
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:56,000
John.

857
00:53:58,498 --> 00:54:00,600
You're my best friend.

858
00:54:10,765 --> 00:54:11,833
Swap.

859
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:30,664
Besides, nobody's dying.

860
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:32,330
I'm going traveling

861
00:54:32,332 --> 00:54:34,097
and you're going
to art school.

862
00:54:35,165 --> 00:54:37,198
Yeah, because
abstract impressionists

863
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,000
are super important right now.

864
00:54:41,633 --> 00:54:43,032
Oh.

865
00:54:46,365 --> 00:54:47,696
You really think
you can still

866
00:54:47,698 --> 00:54:48,999
get away after all this?

867
00:54:50,633 --> 00:54:51,766
Watch me.

868
00:55:01,466 --> 00:55:03,533
Could go through here.
Quicker.

869
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:05,730
Plus, it'll be fun!

870
00:55:05,732 --> 00:55:06,965
Right, lads?

871
00:55:06,967 --> 00:55:10,530
Yeah! Certain death
is so much fun!

872
00:55:10,532 --> 00:55:12,330
Aw! Don't piss your pants!

873
00:55:12,332 --> 00:55:14,763
Pretty dark.

874
00:55:14,765 --> 00:55:17,063
Yeah, it'll be the same
out here soon.

875
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:18,362
Look. We go through here,

876
00:55:18,364 --> 00:55:20,265
we might make it
to the school before sundown.

877
00:55:21,365 --> 00:55:24,198
Come on.
You know we've got this.

878
00:55:28,332 --> 00:55:30,499
All right. Fun way it is.

879
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,833
Eh, can we vote?

880
00:55:34,533 --> 00:55:35,697
Yeah.

881
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,031
Here's your vote.

882
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,463
Live or die?

883
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:43,299
After you!

884
00:55:45,366 --> 00:55:46,633
In you go! Go!

885
00:56:48,665 --> 00:56:50,629
<i>Have a Christmassy Christmas!</i>

886
00:56:56,699 --> 00:57:00,262
Guess there's nobody gnome!

887
00:57:08,698 --> 00:57:09,930
Oh, no!

888
00:57:09,932 --> 00:57:11,333
- Steph!
- Fuck! Chris!

889
00:57:18,033 --> 00:57:19,100
John?

890
00:57:20,365 --> 00:57:21,763
Fuck.

891
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,997
Guys!

892
00:57:24,999 --> 00:57:26,763
Over there.

893
00:57:30,032 --> 00:57:31,198
Come on! Hurry!

894
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,463
Jake?

895
00:57:33,465 --> 00:57:34,465
Tibbsy?

896
00:57:36,632 --> 00:57:38,100
Oh, fuck, guys!

897
00:57:40,398 --> 00:57:41,765
Anna!

898
00:57:43,266 --> 00:57:45,098
- John!
- Anna!

899
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,296
Just get to the door!

900
00:57:46,298 --> 00:57:47,496
Where's John?

901
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:48,696
- What are you doing?
- Where is he?

902
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:50,964
Come on!
For God's sake, Anna!

903
00:57:50,966 --> 00:57:53,129
- What are you doing?
- Go, go, go!

904
00:57:53,131 --> 00:57:54,530
- Come on! Quick, quick, quick!
- Come on!

905
00:57:54,532 --> 00:57:56,296
Oh, no!

906
00:57:56,298 --> 00:57:57,964
- My phone!
- Chris!

907
00:57:57,966 --> 00:57:59,864
Are you fucking kidding me?
Come on!

908
00:57:59,866 --> 00:58:01,967
Move, move, move!
Come on, run!

909
00:58:12,032 --> 00:58:13,497
That was so stupid!

910
00:58:13,499 --> 00:58:14,499
I know.

911
00:58:20,198 --> 00:58:21,964
I'm sorry about your friends.

912
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:23,697
Yeah, they should
have kept up.

913
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:25,697
You should have
left it behind.

914
00:58:25,699 --> 00:58:27,664
It's just plastic and glass.

915
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:30,266
And all my photos and videos.

916
00:58:32,098 --> 00:58:33,633
Lisa and Gran.

917
00:58:36,164 --> 00:58:37,665
They're alive, Chris.

918
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:40,600
You don't believe that.

919
00:58:41,965 --> 00:58:43,599
You think
your girlfriend's dead,

920
00:58:44,198 --> 00:58:45,197
and your parents.

921
00:59:00,731 --> 00:59:02,465
What if everyone is dead?

922
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,032
Then you'll think
of something.

923
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:07,967
You usually do.

924
00:59:09,798 --> 00:59:11,166
It's actually
kind of annoying.

925
00:59:12,364 --> 00:59:14,430
We good to go?

926
00:59:14,432 --> 00:59:16,298
Or does John need
to change his tampon?

927
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:23,499
I can really see why you
find him so irresistible!

928
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:25,630
Shut up.

929
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:28,165
Come on.

930
00:59:31,598 --> 00:59:33,163
Oh, by the way...

931
00:59:33,165 --> 00:59:35,663
I remembered the names
of all Santa's reindeer.

932
00:59:35,665 --> 00:59:37,063
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

933
00:59:37,065 --> 00:59:39,496
- You ready?
- Okay, ready.

934
00:59:39,498 --> 00:59:42,529
So, there's Dasher, Dancer,

935
00:59:42,531 --> 00:59:44,866
Comet, Vixen,

936
00:59:45,831 --> 00:59:47,296
- Cupid...
- Cupid?

937
00:59:47,298 --> 00:59:48,663
I know, right?

938
00:59:48,665 --> 00:59:53,098
Prancer, Donner,
Blitzen and Rudolph!

939
01:00:16,465 --> 01:00:18,631
Come on. Get up. Please.

940
01:00:18,633 --> 01:00:20,029
Get up!

941
01:00:29,798 --> 01:00:32,165
John! John! John!

942
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:33,966
John!

943
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:37,764
John! John!

944
01:00:37,766 --> 01:00:39,333
- No, Anna, no! Leave him.
- John!

945
01:00:40,332 --> 01:00:41,962
Leave him. He's gone.

946
01:00:41,964 --> 01:00:43,931
Leave him.

947
01:00:45,198 --> 01:00:47,330
Leave him.
Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

948
01:00:48,666 --> 01:00:51,366
No! Fuck! No!

949
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:53,197
Hey!

950
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:55,800
Hey! Your dad's
waiting for you.

951
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Yeah.

952
01:01:22,832 --> 01:01:24,199
Holy shit!

953
01:01:40,632 --> 01:01:41,800
Hurry up!

954
01:01:57,032 --> 01:01:58,763
What?

955
01:01:58,765 --> 01:02:00,295
What are you doing?

956
01:02:00,297 --> 01:02:02,665
I am eating my Christmas
dinner, Miss North.

957
01:02:09,965 --> 01:02:12,365
I expect you'll all be wanting
to see your parents.

958
01:02:13,532 --> 01:02:15,730
You're very lucky children,

959
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,432
because they almost...

960
01:02:18,031 --> 01:02:19,032
Left.

961
01:02:34,965 --> 01:02:35,800
Thank you.

962
01:02:55,266 --> 01:02:56,696
It's locked.

963
01:03:12,265 --> 01:03:13,597
What the fuck?

964
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:16,029
Do you know, Miss North,
for such a serious journalist,

965
01:03:16,031 --> 01:03:19,332
your vocabulary does leave
an awful lot to be desired.

966
01:03:20,632 --> 01:03:22,197
You're a teacher,
for God's sake.

967
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:25,763
Not so cocky now,
are we, Miss Shepherd?

968
01:03:25,765 --> 01:03:28,797
I can't wait to show your
daddy what's left of you.

969
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,162
Savage.
Please, please,

970
01:03:30,164 --> 01:03:31,131
please! Oh, God!

971
01:03:32,864 --> 01:03:34,297
- Go!
- Pudding!

972
01:03:34,299 --> 01:03:35,830
- Go!
- Chris!

973
01:03:35,832 --> 01:03:36,928

Now fuck off!

1015
01:05:32,464 --> 01:05:33,762
Where's my dad?

1016
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:34,832
Okay, come on!

1017
01:05:40,931 --> 01:05:42,030
I'll go get
my car keys,

1018
01:05:42,032 --> 01:05:43,533
you go find your dad.
Meet outside.

1019
01:05:45,165 --> 01:05:46,198
Savage!

1020
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:11,299
I didn't mean it about
your parents, and stuff.

1021
01:06:12,664 --> 01:06:14,366
It's, uh... It's fine.

1022
01:06:15,397 --> 01:06:16,999
I know how I am, so...

1023
01:06:18,864 --> 01:06:20,695
Well...

1024
01:06:20,697 --> 01:06:22,131
Whatever happens...

1025
01:06:23,465 --> 01:06:24,599
You've got us.

1026
01:06:29,632 --> 01:06:30,763
Listen.

1027
01:06:33,466 --> 01:06:34,799
It's Lisa's song.

1028
01:07:00,764 --> 01:07:01,765
Chris?

1029
01:07:02,632 --> 01:07:03,632
Baby!

1030
01:07:06,498 --> 01:07:08,029
Savage, he opened the doors,

1031
01:07:08,031 --> 01:07:10,662
and we had to run, and there
was just so many of them.

1032
01:07:10,664 --> 01:07:12,696
But, Bea, her heart...

1033
01:07:12,698 --> 01:07:15,499
But we got her up here,
but her heart was...

1034
01:07:21,264 --> 01:07:22,531
I'm so sorry.

1035
01:07:28,731 --> 01:07:30,631
At least she's not
one of them.

1036
01:07:56,298 --> 01:07:57,497
Bye, Gran.

1037
01:08:14,665 --> 01:08:15,532
Shit!

1038
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:19,764
Hey, don't worry.
We'll find your dad, okay?

1039
01:08:21,365 --> 01:08:22,963
Dream team!

1040
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:25,266
We're a lot of things, Nick,
but we've never been a team.

1041
01:08:26,597 --> 01:08:28,129
Hey...

1042
01:08:28,131 --> 01:08:29,298
It wasn't me, you know.

1043
01:08:30,664 --> 01:08:32,196
That night
you stayed at mine.

1044
01:08:32,198 --> 01:08:34,130
I didn't say nothing
to no one.

1045
01:08:34,132 --> 01:08:35,296
Wait.

1046
01:08:35,298 --> 01:08:37,330
You think that's why
I'm angry with you?

1047
01:08:37,332 --> 01:08:39,763
Yeah, obviously.

1048
01:08:39,765 --> 01:08:41,997
Nick, I don't care
about the sex.

1049
01:08:41,999 --> 01:08:43,528
I'm angry with you
because we shared

1050
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:44,830
all that stuff
about our future,

1051
01:08:44,832 --> 01:08:46,799
and you acted like
it meant something,

1052
01:08:47,664 --> 01:08:49,432
and then you just dumped me!

1053
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:52,765
I trusted you.

1054
01:08:54,132 --> 01:08:55,132
Oh.

1055
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:57,664
That's it?

1056
01:08:59,497 --> 01:09:01,029
You are such a prick.

1057
01:09:01,031 --> 01:09:02,963
Hey, look. Just 'cause your
little fuck buddy died,

1058
01:09:02,965 --> 01:09:04,329
don't go taking it out
all on me.

1059
01:09:04,331 --> 01:09:06,429
Don't you dare
talk about John!

1060
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,698
What have you ever done that
wasn't just about yourself?

1061
01:09:10,031 --> 01:09:11,031
Killed my dad.

1062
01:09:18,964 --> 01:09:19,966
He got bit.

1063
01:09:23,498 --> 01:09:26,129
So he gave me the bat

1064
01:09:26,131 --> 01:09:29,497
and he said,
"Don't you let me down, son.

1065
01:09:30,164 --> 01:09:31,464
For once."

1066
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:35,995
So I...

1067
01:09:46,464 --> 01:09:48,097
Fuck.

01:09:48,099 --> 01:09:50,029

Shit!

1070
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:53,362
Right, I'll hold them back.

1071
01:09:53,364 --> 01:09:54,432
No, we stick together.
