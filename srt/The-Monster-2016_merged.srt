1
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:23,082
<i>Lizzy my mom tells me there's
no such thing as monsters.</i>

2
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:25,651
<i>But she is wrong.</i>

3
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:30,222
<i>They are out there,
waiting for you...</i>

4
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,925
<i>watching.</i>

5
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:37,963
<i>They are in the dark...
Sometimes where you see them...</i>

6
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,732
<i>Sometimes where you don't.</i>

7
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,469
<i>I know that now.</i>

8
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,420
Momma.

9
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:42,955
Stop. Stop shaking me.

10
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,189
Get up!

11
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,924
Stop.

12
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,847
Did I oversleep?

13
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,383
Yes. Get up.

14
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,784
I am getting up.

15
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,854
You said 8:00, it's 9:00!

16
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,056
Are you ready to go?

17
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:21,059
I packed for me, and I packed
for you.

18
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:28,400
Where's Roy? He said he was
gonna call me.

19
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,435
He's an ass.

20
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,538
Damn it, Elizabeth.

21
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,340
Get up.

22
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:38,176
Go load the car.

23
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,913
I should have had dad
pick me up.

24
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,548
Excuse me.
Get up.

25
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,750
I will.
Get up.

26
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,151
I am.

27
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:23,955
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry... I fell back asleep.

28
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,130
I'm sorry, okay!

29
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,135
You can't smoke in the car.

30
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,206
Fine.

31
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:53,852
Quit playing with that.
Give it! Give it!

32
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,909
You're too old for that.

33
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:54,613
You're too old for a lot
of things.

34
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,354
Turn on the car,
roll down the window.

35
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:54,406
I was gonna give you this
when we got there.

36
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,415
It was grandma's.

37
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,184
Yeah.

38
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,289
Why are you giving it to me?

39
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,626
Because you're not coming back.

40
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,996
I didn't say that.

41
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,166
Yeah, but you're not gonna...

42
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,052
If we stop in Darlington
tonight...

43
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,622
It's only 4 hours
until we get there.

44
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:53,999
Yeah. Just tell me
when you wanna stop.

45
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,650
You know what? Honestly, Lizzy,
I'm done, okay?

46
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,686
Just get in the goddamn car!

47
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,121
I don't want to!

48
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:19,424
I don't care! I'm not
gonna ask you again.

49
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,260
Look, I know this
is a big night for you.

50
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,461
I don't care!

51
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,696
Yes, you do!

52
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,197
It's my play!

53
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:30,135
Yes, and you are going to be
late. Get in the goddamn car!

54
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,937
Get your ass in there right now!

55
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:34,706
I don't want you to go.
I don't want you to go.

56
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:35,941
I don't want you to go.

57
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:37,976
What did you say?

58
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:41,146
I don't want you there!

59
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:51,289
Well, that is some tough fucking
shit, because I'm going.

60
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,559
This is a big night for you
and I know that.

61
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,527
Just drop me off.

62
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,128
Fuck you!

63
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,864
Don't talk to me like that.

64
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,366
Fuck you, fuck you.

65
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,701
Don't talk to me like that.

66
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,936
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

67
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,404
I hate you.
Fuck you.

68
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,572
I hate you.

69
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,107
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you,
fuck you, fuck you!

70
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,276
Fuck you! Fuck you!
I hate you! I hate you.

71
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,944
It's my play.

72
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,280
You never come, you never care,
you never come to anything!

73
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:19,784
You know what? You know what?
Find your own goddamn ride!

74
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,935
Fuck you!

75
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:06,031
You sure you want to keep going?

76
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:10,602
I called dad and Jenna,
they said they'll stay up.

77
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,841
I wanna sleep there.

78
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,816
Are you tired?

79
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,524
No, I'll be fine.

80
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,534
I think it's gonna rain.

81
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,872
I hate thunder.

82
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,827
I know you do.

83
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,843
Hey... can I?

84
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,512
Crack your window.

85
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,639
What time is it?

86
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:30,008
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

87
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:38,483
It's 12...

88
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,585
:15.

89
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:44,189
And not a soul in sight.

90
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,391
Don't do that.

91
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,993
I'm just kidding.

92
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,662
It's not funny.

93
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,832
You need to lighten up.

94
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:06,444
I wish you listened more.

95
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,047
I wish you'd quit saying that.

96
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,352
Oh shit... damn it!

97
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

98
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,041
Oh, god!

99
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,215
Baby! Are you okay?

100
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:48,052
Look at me! Are you okay?

101
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,588
Are you okay?

102
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,257
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

103
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,391
Mommy.

104
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,226
Just tell me what hurts.
Ow!

105
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,061
Mom!

106
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:02,267
Ow, my wrist! Fuck! Oh, god.

107
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,502
Mom, you're bleeding.

108
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:07,171
Are you sure you're okay?

109
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,374
Mom, what do we do?

110
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:13,111
We gotta call 9-1-1.

111
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,847
We gotta call 9-1-1.

112
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,493
Oh, shit.

113
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:53,851
Hello?
We've been in a accident.

114
00:15:53,853 --> 00:16:00,458
My mom has... she hurt her head,
it's bleeding.

115
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,963
Where are we?

116
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:09,667
Tell them we passed the 40 like
30 minutes ago, going south.

117
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,537
We passed the 40 about
30 minutes ago.

118
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,604
Tell them that we...
At that fork...

119
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:14,872
Where there's construction...

120
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,307
Tell them where there's
construction...

121
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,709
We went on the old road.

122
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:21,145
We're on the old road.
I don't...

123
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,916
I don't know. Okay.

124
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,086
What did they say?

125
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:32,023
They're sending an ambulance
and a tow truck thing.

126
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:35,126
See if there's a band-aid
in my purse.

127
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,211
You want to get out?

128
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,751
What if it's still alive?

129
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:41,426
Baby, look at it.
It hasn't moved.

130
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:42,760
But still...

131
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,167
Ow!

132
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,538
Okay, try your side.

133
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:04,582
Hey... it's all right.
Come on, be brave.

134
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,925
Climb out.

135
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:26,998
Baby? You're gonna need
to call your dad.

136
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,970
He can come get you wherever
they're taking us.

137
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,773
What are you gonna do?

138
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,475
I gotta deal with this.

139
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:41,379
I'll have Roy come and get me
in the morning. Call him.

140
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,861
Hi, dad? Dad, we got
into an accident.

141
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:05,136
No, I'm okay.
Yeah, so is mom.

142
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:12,210
Um, no, dad... she wasn't.
Dad, she's fine.

143
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:20,318
No, it... it was raining and
there was something in the road.

144
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,391
It was scary. We hit a wolf.
Yeah, mom made me call.

145
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,705
Oh, god.

146
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:20,111
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

147
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:23,347
You can do it,
you can lick it, baby.

148
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:27,952
Just don't do it, just don't do
it, just go to fucking bed.

149
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,356
Just go to bed. Just go to bed.

150
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,098
Oh, fuck, fuck.

151
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,257
Is it dead?

152
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,126
I don't know.

153
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,230
It looks dead.

154
00:23:54,866 --> 00:24:00,004
Yeah... it does.

155
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,311
Look at this.

156
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,424
Let's go back to the car.

157
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,094
Okay.

158
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:38,809
Some of those cuts on the wolf
weren't from the crash.

159
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,445
I think it was fighting
with something.

160
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:44,315
What?

161
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:51,155
I don't know, there are lots of
things that hide in the woods.

162
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,591
Can I see your arm?

163
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,646
Stay still.

164
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,765
Oh, thank god.

165
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:18,676
Maybe he knows...
Where they'll be taking us.

166
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,426
Momma...

167
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,227
Uh-huh.

168
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,200
Where'd the wolf go?

169
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,063
Ma'am? Ma'am, you all right?

170
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:16,400
Yeah, yeah, we're fine.
We're fine, it's just my wrist.

171
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,941
Sorry, sweetheart.

172
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,910
Station called, said the
ambulance is gonna be a bit.

173
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:29,847
Let me get your things,
put 'em in my truck.

174
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,148
I'll get your car ready.

175
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,784
Okay. Thank you.

176
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:35,486
I don't want to get out.

177
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:39,823
Baby, that thing probably just
crawled into the woods to die.

178
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,158
That's all.

179
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,697
My name's Jesse.

180
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:47,765
Hey.

181
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,366
I hope y'all aren't too
shaken up.

182
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:52,536
We hit a wolf, if you can
believe it.

183
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:53,804
Get out, I want to help him.

184
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:55,873
Well, nobody much takes this
road any more.

185
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,942
I'm not surprised that animals
don't think twice...

186
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:01,245
About crossing it.

187
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,713
Where'd it go?

188
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:05,382
Uh, I think it got up.

189
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:10,854
Well, shit... must've just
spooked it then.

190
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:14,224
All right, that's it.

191
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:16,994
Your ambulance will be
coming in a minute.

192
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:18,495
Okay.

193
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:20,297
There's a big wreck
on the highway...

194
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,400
It's slowing everything down.

195
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,369
It's okay, I think we'll
just stay in this car.

196
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,471
Can you hook it up
with us in there?

197
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:30,908
Yeah, yeah, y'all right, go on.

198
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:49,159
Aw, dang it.

199
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:53,464
You got a...
Axel broke in half.

200
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:56,900
You got oil pouring out like
it's trying to get away.

201
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:03,474
I'm gonna have to work on it
before we get going.

202
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:07,211
You want to pop it? Pop it?

203
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:15,652
Why would it run out
in the road?

204
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,488
Who knows?

205
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:23,227
It had to have seen us, right?

206
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:24,528
It's probably just running.

207
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,430
From what?

208
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:49,820
Dogs don't got teeth like this.
Their teeth are small.

209
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,399
We hit a wolf.

210
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,140
Damn it!

211
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,909
What time is it?

212
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,913
Late.

213
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:19,917
Late 30 or late 45?

214
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,866
Stay in there.

215
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:48,245
Baby, where'd you put my phone?
I want to call your dad.

216
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:51,048
I think it's in my bag.

217
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,616
He took it?

218
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:00,424
Holy... son of a bitch.

219
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:06,697
Go tell him we want our phone.
Go tell him.

220
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,198
Do I have to?

221
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,602
We have to call your dad, go on.
Go on, he's gonna be worried.

222
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:13,370
Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

223
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,052
Mister?

224
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,321
Jesse.

225
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:34,524
Mr. Jesse, we need our phone.

226
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:38,896
I'll be out in a minute. You can
go get it yourself.

227
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:27,177
Mister! I need the key!

228
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:31,448
Oh, goddamn it!
I'll be out in a sec!

229
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,117
Momma, come look!

230
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:44,921
Momma?

231
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,560
Oh, shit.

232
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,564
Mom!

233
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:07,711
I found it! I found the wolf!

234
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,222
Sorry we hit you.

235
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,270
Momma?

236
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:15,172
I hate you. I hate you.

237
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,377
I hate you.

238
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,849
Go away.

239
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,051
Should have got you a jacket.

240
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,790
Come here.

241
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,262
Did you hear me out there?

242
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:15,432
Uh, no, I guess not.

243
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:18,501
I called for you.

244
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,470
What happened?

245
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:21,638
I found it.

246
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,173
Found what?

247
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:24,507
The wolf.

248
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,409
Where'd you see it?

249
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,946
In the woods. Something ate it.

250
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,085
Should have left it alone.

251
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,486
I did!

252
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,597
Come on! Goddamn it!

253
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:17,961
We're gonna be gone soon,
and you know...

254
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:20,964
Birds will eat it in the
morning.

255
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:25,468
What would do that?

256
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,804
Baby, are you scared?

257
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:34,611
Hey! It's not gonna come
after people.

258
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:37,647
You promise?

259
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,883
I promise.

260
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:46,356
Where is the fucking ambulance?

261
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,828
Let's go, man! Come on!

262
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,697
What's his name?

263
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,031
Jesse.

264
00:38:55,033 --> 00:39:01,137
Jesse. Hey, Jesse!
Come on, man, let's go!

265
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,975
Mister?

266
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,012
Hang on a sec.

267
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,754
Where is he?

268
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:19,856
He's down there.

269
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:24,494
Why won't he answer?

270
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:40,643
I don't hear him.

271
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,412
Hey!

272
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,053
Jesse?

273
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,556
Momma?

274
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,302
I'm going out there.

275
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,638
Let's just wait here... please!

276
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,574
You stop making this into
a thing. Honestly, stop.

277
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,844
Don't get weird on me. I'm just
gonna go out and find him.

278
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:15,912
Why?

279
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,013
Because I don't just sit.

280
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:18,581
Don't go.

281
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:22,619
Not one word out of you, not one
more word. You hear me, Lizzy?

282
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,587
Is he there?

283
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,930
Jesse!

284
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,977
Where is he?

285
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,274
You out there?

286
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:28,044
Oh, my god, oh, my god. Oh!

287
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

288
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,229
It's okay. It's okay.

289
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:52,735
It's okay. We're gonna be okay.

290
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,404
The ambulance will be here soon.

291
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,272
What if they never get here?

292
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:59,809
Stop, don't... don't think like
that. Don't think like that.

293
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:02,845
They're coming.
They're on their way.

294
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:04,747
I want my daddy.

295
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:14,090
Hey... hey! I'm right here.

296
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,693
I don't care.

297
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,763
Hey.

298
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:32,775
I told you... I told you not
to get out of the car...

299
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,978
And you never listen to me.

300
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:40,383
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

301
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:41,884
He could have killed you.

302
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:47,557
Nothing happened to me.
I'm okay, I'm right here.

303
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,465
I'm right here.

304
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,377
Momma?

305
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:42,812
What?

306
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:56,693
What do we do?

307
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:04,834
I don't know. I don't know.

308
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,119
Please don't! Please?

309
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:25,955
We can't just leave him
out there.

310
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:27,390
Please?

311
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,864
Agh! Oh, no!

312
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,873
Agh!

313
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:52,448
I don't know what to do.

314
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:56,419
I know what you think, okay!
I know what you think!

315
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:01,758
What is it? What?

316
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,426
I see it.

317
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:35,124
Turn around! Turn around!

318
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,192
Turn around!

319
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:37,860
Turn around!

320
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,505
Mom, where is it?

321
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:50,773
I don't know! I don't know! I
don't know!

322
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:53,276
Where is it? Where is it?

323
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:38,421
Don't look. Don't look,
don't look.

324
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:48,598
Mom.

325
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:11,787
Ssh... it's okay.

326
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,758
It's okay.

327
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:20,029
It's not.

328
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,108
You're an idiot!

329
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,943
You think you're so fucking
smart, don't you?

330
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:36,512
Well, maybe I feel a little less
with you being here.

331
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:37,680
I told you, over and over
and over again...

332
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:39,282
Don't touch my fucking beer!

333
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:40,349
It's my house!

334
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:41,484
It's my fucking beer!

335
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:43,352
It's my fucking house!

336
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:45,221
Dumb ass, it's not in there.
I told you it's not in there.

337
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:46,389
I know it's not in there! I know
where I put them!

338
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:47,890
Lizzy, where are you! Lizzy!

339
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:51,527
This is the last time! Lizzy!

340
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:55,898
Lizzy! Lizzy!
Where are you, you little shit!

341
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,001
Lizzy!

342
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:03,105
Momma!

343
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,140
Where are they?

344
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:05,308
I don't know.

345
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,842
Speak up!
Hey!

346
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:10,780
Get away from her.
She's got 'em, okay?

347
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,548
I fucking know that!
Well, get them!

348
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:16,953
Look at me.

349
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:17,987
Look at your mother!

350
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:19,622
Look at me!

351
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,429
Give me them.

352
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:28,264
I don't have them.

353
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:29,265
Give me them!

354
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:32,134
Shit.

355
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:36,172
Store closes in eight minutes.
Wait. Baby, wait!

356
00:49:36,174 --> 00:49:39,742
Momma, i... I don't... i...

357
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:58,995
Mom! Mom?

358
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:03,532
Mom, please! Mom!

359
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:28,057
Ssh. Ssh.

360
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,160
Ssh.

361
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:34,030
What was that?

362
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,502
I don't know.

363
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:43,873
Was it a monster?

364
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,209
I don't know.

365
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,644
Monsters aren't real.

366
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:51,947
Ssh, I know.

367
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:54,617
You said...

368
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:57,686
I was wrong.

369
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:07,196
Ssh. Ssh.

370
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:12,968
I don't... I don't want to die.

371
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:20,042
Ssh. Ssh.

372
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:46,469
The door to his truck is open.
I'm just gonna take a look.

373
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:47,670
No.

374
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:49,238
It doesn't know we're in here.

375
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,274
You don't know that.

376
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:56,545
Ssh. Ssh.

377
00:51:56,547 --> 00:52:03,119
If we can get his keys,
we can get out of here.

378
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:10,593
He had them. He might have
dropped them.

379
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:16,332
Momma, I don't want you to.

380
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:23,839
I could just peek.
You can stay here.

381
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:26,475
Stay, stay here with doggy.

382
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:27,910
Mommy.

383
00:52:27,912 --> 00:52:32,014
Be very quiet. Be very
quiet. It's okay.

384
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:17,293
What's out there?

385
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,397
I'm not sure.

386
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:43,018
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

387
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Ssh. Be still.

388
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:09,578
Be still. Be still, be still.

389
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,449
Stay quiet. Stay there.

390
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,019
Ssh.

391
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:49,518
It's come back.

392
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,896
It's okay.

393
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:11,507
It's okay. Ssh.

394
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:17,913
Momma!

395
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:19,415
Momma! Momma!

396
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

397
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,968
Hold on. Hold on, momma!

398

Help us! Please, help!
Please help us!

399
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:47,509
Okay, ma'am, stay where you are!

400

Please help us! Help!

401
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:49,578
There's somebody out there!

402
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,715
Ladies. Hey, hey, hey!

403
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:56,051
Get her away from it, please!

404
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:57,553
The monster, what the fuck?

405
00:55:57,555 --> 00:55:58,821
Ma'am, relax.

406
00:55:58,823 --> 00:56:01,223
Get us out of here!

407
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:02,991
We're just gonna hold
for a moment.

408
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:04,393
All right, now roll over,
please.

409
00:56:04,395 --> 00:56:07,129
Fuck, you get us off
of this fucking road!

410
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:09,131
Get us off this fucking road!

411
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:10,866
Hey! Ma'am, hey, look at me.

412
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,334
Get off this fucking road!

413
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:13,769
Look at me, my name is John.
We're here to help you.

414
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:15,104
Get us away!

415
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:17,272
Dispatch, we need a medical
examiner out here...

416
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:19,241
And animal control as soon
as possible.

417
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:21,143
Squad cars can find the flares.

418
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:24,713
Please.

419
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:28,384
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

420
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:29,218
Mom.

421
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,020
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

422
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,592
We're gonna go real soon.
We're gonna go real soon, okay?

423
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:38,994
All right, we're good to go.
Everything's gonna be okay.

424
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:40,262
You'll be okay.

425
00:56:40,264 --> 00:56:42,431
Goddamn it, hold on.
You're okay.

426
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:45,567
Ah, damn it... Williams!

427
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,203
Let's get out of here.

428
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:20,569
Close the door. Close the door.

429
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:24,973
Mom, don't.

430
00:57:24,975 --> 00:57:27,910
They can put it back in.
Close the door now.

431
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,422
What do we do?
Just stay close to me, okay?

432
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:44,426
Get back on the gurney.

433
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:45,928
Where is he?

434
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,797
I don't know. What happened
to you?

435
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,299
Just get us out of here.

436
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:52,434
I just need you to stay calm,
okay?

437
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, my god.

438
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

439
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:47,022
Go, mom, go, go, go!

440
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:50,225
Hold on to something!

441
00:58:58,401 --> 00:58:59,902
Oh, my god.
We did it.

442
00:58:59,904 --> 00:59:01,370
Ah, fuck you.

443
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:07,876
Oh, fuck you, you fucking devil!

444
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,211
We did it.

445
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

446
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:01,263
Ow.

447
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,810
No... no.

448
01:00:14,812 --> 01:00:17,346
Mom.

449
01:00:17,348 --> 01:00:23,986
Please wake up, wake up, wake
up. Please open your eyes.

450
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:26,188
Open your eyes, please.

451
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:29,424
Oh, no.

452
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,131
Wake up.

453
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:41,770
Oh, god, help. Help, help, help.

454
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:46,808
Mom, it's me, it's okay, it's
me, it's okay. It's okay.

455
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:51,580
It's okay... oh, please.

456
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:02,391
We have to get back.
We have to get back.

457
01:01:02,393 --> 01:01:05,560
Go, go, go, get back, get away.

458
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:37,092
Okay, are you okay? Oh, god.

459
01:01:37,094 --> 01:01:40,962
Oh, god, are you okay?

460
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:42,297
My head hurts.

461
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:47,102
Show me, show me. Oh.

462
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:49,805
Is this my blood or your blood?

463
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:52,240
You're okay.

464
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:56,445
You're okay.

465
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:01,616
Okay.

466
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,306
Help us.

467
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:33,682
Help us.

468
01:02:33,684 --> 01:02:36,618
Help.

469
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,590
Damn it.

470
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:47,696
Oh, goddamn it.

471
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:52,501
God damn it.

472
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:05,614
You try to be quiet... okay?

473
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:06,948
Okay.

474
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

475
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

476
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,600
No.
It's okay.

477
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:14,009
We need to make a fire.

478
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:15,744
Why?

479
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:19,514
Because we need to get you
to the road...

480
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:23,418
So you can get aw...
So you can get away.

481
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,997
Take it. Take it.

482
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:40,468
We can't go out there.

483
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:47,108
Look, they can't... they won't
know we're here.

484
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:01,957
They can't see you down here.

485
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,041
I've got a plan.

486
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,678
I'm gonna need you.

487
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:32,153
I'm gonna need you
to be brave, okay?

488
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,158
I need you to be brave.

489
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:41,830
I need you to be braver
than you've ever been.

490
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,901
<i>Kathy I can distract it.</i>

491
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:52,640
<i>I can use the fire,
I can use it.</i>

492
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:59,447
<i>So I can go out there,
and it'll follow me...</i>

493
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:04,152
<i>So that you can go out there
and you can get away.</i>

494
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,188
It'll get to you.

495
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:10,558
No, no...

496
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,497
It will be afraid.

497
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:19,701
Monsters don't like the light...

498
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:23,538
That's what night lights
are for, right?

499
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:27,609
Don't lie to me.

500
01:07:27,611 --> 01:07:29,911
I'm not.

501
01:07:29,913 --> 01:07:33,548
Yes, you are.

502
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:43,858
Yes, I am.

503
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:03,711
Listen to me.

504
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:14,255
I'm gonna die.

505
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:22,597
Real soon... whether I go
out there or not.

506
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,799
You can't die.

507
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:26,401
No, you can't die.

508
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:28,002
Why?

509
01:08:28,004 --> 01:08:34,109
Because you... you are the
reason I'm here.

510
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:40,381
<i>Kathy look at me.</i>

511
01:08:40,383 --> 01:08:47,455
<i>When I call for you, I need you
to run as fast as you can.</i>

512
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:51,192
<i>Lizzy we could go together.</i>

513
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:59,400
Don't look back. Don't look back
no matter what happens, okay?

514
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:01,302
With me, don't look back.

515
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:09,644
I'll get help. I'll get help and
they can come back, and they...

516
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:12,213
And then they can save you.

517
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:18,286
That's our plan.

518
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:21,723
That's our plan. Okay?

519
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,397
That's our plan.

520
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:38,740
Lizzy! Lizzy, be ready!

521
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:45,313
Come back! Come back, I don't
want to go! I don't want to go.

522
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:49,184
You do what I say!

523
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:52,620
I won't leave you!

524
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:56,257
Baby, please? You do what I say!

525
01:09:57,393 --> 01:09:59,060
Do what I say!

526
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:04,332
I'm here!

527
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:12,240
Are you scared?

528
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:41,169
Lizzy, be ready.

529
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:05,727
Lizzy, run!

530
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

531
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:52,940
Go away!

532
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:58,813
No, get away, get away!

533
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:09,090
Mom. Mom.

534
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:12,960
Lizzy.

535
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:16,297
Lizzy.

536
01:12:16,299 --> 01:12:22,470
Oh, mommy, mommy, please get up.
I want you to so bad, please.

537
01:12:22,472 --> 01:12:25,773
Please, please, please.
Please get up. Please.

538
01:12:25,775 --> 01:12:27,375
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

539
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:30,044
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

540
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:35,583
Mommy, get up, please, please,
please. Please.

541
