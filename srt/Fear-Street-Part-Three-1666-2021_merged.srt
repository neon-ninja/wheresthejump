1
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:08,500
You saw the witch and you survived.

2
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,416
Maybe that can help us.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,541
This was July 12th, 1978.

4
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:16,791
The first day of camp.

5
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:19,750
<i>Shadyside!</i>

6
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,500
<i>A week later...</i>

7
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,166
<i>my sister was dead.</i>

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,833
Only Cindy Berman would expect
to clean the outhouse and not get dirty.

9
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,166
Tommy!

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,708
- Who are you?
- Nick Goode. Nice to meet you.

11
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,291
Deep down, you feel it, don't you?

12
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,125
Shadyside, there's something cursing us.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,916
Bad things always happen
to Shadysiders.

14
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,166
The witch is real.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,791
And she's possessing people!

16
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,000
Tommy Slater!

17
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,416
Every name on that rock!

18
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,333
Mary... she tried to kill him.

19
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,583
We have to find a way out.

20
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,416
Sarah Fier's lost hand.

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,333
"The curse will last

22
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:14,000
until body and hand unite."

23
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,666
We can save Shadyside.

24
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,416
We have to bury this thing...

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,000
right fucking now.

26
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:23,875
Dig!

27
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,791
- Where is she? The body?
- I don't know.

28
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,895
<i>I told everyone the story.</i>

29
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,500
The curse, it's... it's real.

30
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:38,541
<i>No one believed me.</i>

31
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,416
We know where the body is,
so all we need is the hand.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Is it still buried under the Hanging Tree?

33
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:56,708
Sarah!

34
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,458
Sarah Fier!

35
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,041
Sarah!

36
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:32,791
Sarah!

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,125
There's one more. It's breeched.

38
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,416
Hold her still.

39
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,250
I feel it. It's fighting to get out.

40
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,625
Tough little bastard.

41
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:56,791
I said hold her!

42
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:57,958
Sorry!

43
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,083
Quiet, you beast.

44
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,666
We're going to lose her.
We're going to lose both.

45
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,750
No, we aren't.

46
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,791
Don't go wobbly on me now, Henry.

47
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,916
- On three, all right?
- All right.

48
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,875
One...

49
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,041
two...

50
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,833
three.

51
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,875
Seven piglets.
And not a stillborn among them.

52
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,916
You have a gift, Sarah.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,541
It's luck is all.

54
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,958
Luck and a very sharp knife.

55
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,750
This wicked one is going to Solomon.

56
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,750
- He's lucky to have a friend like you.
- Father...

57
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,791
What? He's struggled so.

58
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:45,750
First his child, then his wife.
He needs someone to take care of him.

59
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,333
Someone strong and capable.

60
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:52,041
I'm not marrying Solomon bloody Goode,
if that's what you're driving at.

61
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,875
I worry about you. Is it so wrong
for a father to wish his daughter to wed?

62
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,708
And leave you alone
to eat up all the bacon?

63
00:03:58,791 --> 00:03:59,791
Not likely.

64
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,291
A full moon rises before nightfall.

65
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,333
Good night to enjoy
the fruits of the land.

66
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,166
- Alderman Goode.
- Sarah.

67
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,791
A full moon rises before nightfall.

68
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,166
A good night to enjoy
the fruits of the land.

69
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,791
Try to clean yourself up before then.

70
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,166
<i>♪ Pastor Miller, blind as a bat ♪</i>

71
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,125
<i>♪ Pastor Miller, blind as a bat! ♪</i>

72
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,041
<i>♪ Tried to read the Bible
And his eyes went splat! ♪</i>

73
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:11,208
Oh, but I see you.
I've got eyes in the back of my head!

74
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,333
- Don't be a brat, Constance!
- Don't be a shrew, Abigail!

75
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,208
Sarah!

76
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,625
A full moon rises before nightfall.

77
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,583
Good night to enjoy fruits of the land.

78
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,791
I'm coming too!

79
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:27,875
No, you're not.

80
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,208
Then I'm telling Mother.

81
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,958
You tell Mother and I'll cut
your braids off your head.

82
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,708
Don't be getting us into trouble.
You know what Mother will do.

83
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,916
A full moon rises before nightfall.

84
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,125
Holy Hannah Miller?
Don't tell me you're going.

85
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, I'm going.

86
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:51,083
In fact, I'm going with Lizzie before
to get berries from the widow.

87
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,000
What?

88
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,541
Hannah, it's one thing for Lizzie
to trade with that hag.

89
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,916
It's another for the pastor's daughter.

90
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,833
Aren't you even a little curious?

91
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,833
I'll only go if you go.

92
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,500
Please?

93
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,416
Girl, what's taking so long?
I need help with...

94
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,708
Get inside.

95
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,708
I can see a secret about you, girl.

96
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,666
And a good day to you, Thomas.

97
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,291
Don't you want to hear it,

98
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,125
pretty girl?

99
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,375
Good girl.

100
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,458
I can see everything.

101
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,791
I see all the dark secrets in Union.

102
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,833
You must be busy.

103
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,583
I see the darkness in you, girl!

104
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,125
Be still, Thomas!

105
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,750
Beware, Sarah Fier.

106
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,750
Solomon!

107
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,708
Sarah.

108
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,958
This is madness, Sarah.

109
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,750
It's too much. I can't accept it.

110
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,791
Just think of it as my dowry.

111
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,750
We're practically married.
Haven't you heard?

112
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,500
Well, in that case, tell your father
this isn't nearly worth it.

113
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,541
- But thank you, truly.
- Of course.

114
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,000
Shadows fall on us all now and then.

115
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,250
My, uh...

116
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,041
My brother wants me to give up.

117
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,416
Move back to the settlement.

118
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,833
He says the Goode family are not farmers.

119
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,500
But these lands, they are fertile.
I know it.

120
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,791
We'll have a healthy crop yet.

121
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,708
The sun will shine on us.

122
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,125
You ought to rest some.

123
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,708
You look like death.

124
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,375
Sarah Fier, flattering as ever.

125
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,458
Well, I'm going to lose light.

126
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:26,958
I should go.

127
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,000
Full moon rises before nightfall.

128
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,083
Nothing good comes
from those woods after sundown.

129
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,833
You sound like my father.

130
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,541
So you're going?

131
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,291
Going where?

132
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,583
Henry!

133
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,125
Shouldn't you be sleeping?

134
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,875
Shouldn't <i>you </i>be sleeping?
Father wouldn't approve.

135
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,166
Then don't tell him.

136
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,166
The berries make you see
the world beyond our own. Just one bite.

137
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,208
What does an old lady need
with that?

138
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,791
She's not just an old lady.

139
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,666
The widow's 1,000 years old.

140
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,125
She drinks the blood of virgins
to keep her youth.

141
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,208
You're safe then.

142
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,041
She sacrificed her husband
to become the Devil's bride.

143
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,708
That's how she gained eternal life.

144
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,333
Well, I heard she kept the company
of the natives,

145
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,916
and that she even fell in love with one.

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,750
That's why she was exiled.

147
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,416
She learned their medicine too.
Solomon told me.

148
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,958
He took his wife to her
after they lost their child,

149
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,250
but it was too late.

150
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,541
Are you sure this is the right way?
How do <i>you </i>know where we're going?

151
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:56,583
I've been there before. Remember
when Abigail had her ring of fire?

152
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,291
She was scratching like a dog
during Father's sermon.

153
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,750
Mother told me she'd lain with a demon.

154
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,458
The Devil's gift.

155
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,791
More like Mad Thomas's gift.

156
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,875
Well, whoever she lay with,
Abbi made me go to the widow with her.

157
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,916
- And the widow fixed her with witchcraft?
- Yes, witchcraft.

158
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:17,000
And some foul-smelling paste
made for whores like Abbi Berman.

159
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,916
Are we sure about this?

160
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,541
Widow Mary?

161
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,375
Widow Mary?

162
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,041
She's not here.

163
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,125
Find the berries.

164
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:15,958
Abbadon...

165
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,000
Azazel...

166
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,625
Beelzebub...

167
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,166
Moloch.

168
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:26,875
Satan.

169
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,375
Don't.

170
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,125
Widow...

171
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,083
The veil has grown thin
with the turn of the moon.

172
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,916
And with it,

173
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,875
the Morning Star rises.

174
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,625
Beware the Devil. He lives in that book.

175
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,125
He calls to you from it.

176
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,708
He senses you now.

177
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,541
And if you're not careful,

178
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:56,166
he'll bore himself beneath your skin

179
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,500
and he'll consume you from the inside out.

180
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,166
Sarah?

181
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,750
Get out.

182
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,625
Get out.

183
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,500
Get out!

184
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,000
Get out! You get out!

185
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,166
Go! Go!

186
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,666
Full moon rises.

187
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,416
To the fruits of the land.

188
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,291
Come to the woods with me.

189
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,375
Entertain yourself with someone else.

190
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,708
Get off of me! Stop!

191
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,666
Caleb, stop!

192
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,625
Don't tease me, girl.

193
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,416
She's not teasing!

194
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,708
What, are you jealous?

195
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,166
Sarah Fier, you want a kiss too?

196
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,041
You know, maybe if you weren't
such a frigid bitch...

197
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,333
There's your kiss.

198
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,625
And if you're still so eager,

199
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:50,416
I'm sure there's a mule tied up
who will overlook your flaws in the dark.

200
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,958
You're completely mad.

201
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,791
No...

202
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,958
I'm just not afraid with you.

203
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,625
We should go back.

204
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,125
Should we?

205
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,416
We can't.

206
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,916
This is wrong.

207
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,166
Doesn't feel wrong.

208
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,708
Tell me to stop and I shall.

209
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,666
What was that?

210
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,666
Someone was there.

211
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,958
Someone saw us.

212
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,416
They couldn't.

213
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
What if it was the widow or Caleb?

214
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,916
Caleb can barely find his own member.

215
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,666
But if he saw us, if he tells...

216
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,750
That spoiled piglet doesn't scare me.

217
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,958
They'll hang us, Sarah.

218
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,041
Well, let them hang us then.

219
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,583
I was not alive before now anyway.

220
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,083
Sinners, sinners.

221
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,833
Oh, damn you, Merryboy!

222
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,833
Get in, you brute.

223
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,958
Sarah! It's half six.

224
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,666
You've overslept.
I've done most of the morning work.

225
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,125
All right.

226
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:28,958
I'm coming.

227
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,166
<i>Merryboy!</i>

228
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,958
Merryboy, time to eat!

229
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,541
Oh, where are you, dog?

230
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,333
Merryboy?

231
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,583
- Merryboy?
- Sarah?

232
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,250
Oh, heavens.

233
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,041
You scared me.

234
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,791
There's something wrong with my father.

235
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,958
The voice shall sing.
Order's furnace beckons now.

236
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,791
To be freed, to be released.

237
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,125
What is he saying?

238
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,375
I don't know.

239
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,500
The voice shall soon become.

240
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,625
<i>Cyrus...</i>

241
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,708
When did this start?

242
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,208
Just this morning.

243
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,708
He's distracted,

244
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,208
listening to things only he can hear.

245
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,041
Perhaps it is prayer?

246
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,666
No.

247
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,166
No, something is...

248
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,708
wrong.

249
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,875
I look in his eyes and it's as if...

250
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,708
As if something crawled in from the night
and put on Father's skin.

251
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,500
It looks like him, but...

252
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,750
He's not himself, Sarah.

253
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,083
Mother's gone to the meeting house.

254
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,958
She says we must ask God,

255
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,000
but I don't know which Psalm,

256
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,375
what passage...

257
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,833
He needs proper medicine, Hannah.

258
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,083
- I will talk to your mother.
- No!

259
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,666
She can't know you were here.

260
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,541
I'm not to see you anymore.

261
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,125
Not to see me?

262
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,583
She suspects us, Sarah.

263
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,375
She suspects our...

264
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,750
wickedness.

265
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,291
And now Father is sick.

266
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,083
Do you think...

267
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,375
Did we cause it?

268
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,041
Hannah...

269
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,416
Everything will be all right.

270
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,625
You! You!

271
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,416
You won't stop until you've
completely ruined her life, will you?

272
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,625
- Mother!
- You shut your mouth!

273
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,333
Thomas saw you last night in town!

274
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:37,583
He's telling everyone! How dare you
bring this filth into our home!

275
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,333
I see what you really are, girl.

276
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,000
An abomination corrupting my daughter.

277
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,833
Born of perversion!

278
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,583
Goody Miller, please!

279
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,875
God knows what you are, girl!

280
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,125
You'd better pray for mercy
on your damned soul!

281
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:27,666
Sarah, Thomas has been talking.
There something you want to tell me?

282
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:30,708
No.

283
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,000
I heard you come home late last night.

284
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,375
You were out
with the pastor's daughter, weren't you?

285
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,250
And Abbi.

286
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,416
And Lizzie and...

287
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,750
the others.

288
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,125
If your mother was still alive...

289
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,208
You know, it was your mother
who convinced us to settle this land.

290
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:01,583
She was wise enough to understand
this land was special.

291
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,958
<i>She said she could feel it in the air.</i>

292
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:07,541
<i>The lake.</i>

293
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
<i>The woods.</i>

294
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,958
<i>So we put down roots...</i>

295
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,416
<i>and made up our own Eden here.</i>

296
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,041
She was a good woman.

297
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,875
And I fear in her absence...

298
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,250
I have failed her.

299
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,458
I have failed you both.

300
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Father...

301
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:38,166
There has always been
a strangeness in you, Sarah.

302
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,625
A streak...

303
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,916
Something perhaps
a mother could have rooted out,

304
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,416
but you were raised like a boy.

305
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,708
I gave you too much freedom,

306
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,708
and now it is too late.

307
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,291
It's my fault.

308
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,333
Father...

309
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:33,666
Sarah!

310
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,125
What is it? What's wrong?

311
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,041
The babes are gone.

312
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:44,916
She ate them.

313
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:49,541
She ate them all.

314
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,416
Bring me the ax, Henry.

315
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,375
Sarah...

316
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:57,500
The ax!

317
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,166
The dark one has come

318
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,833
to harvest the bitter fruit
of the evil we have sown.

319
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,500
To feast on our misdeeds.

320
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,791
And yet you all smile,

321
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:50,000
blind to the horrors around us.

322
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,750
But you see it now, don't you?

323
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,625
He blocks our well,

324
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,583
clogs it with our sin.

325
00:25:58,666 --> 00:25:59,958
It's stuck!

326
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,000
He takes our water.
He takes our life blood!

327
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,458
What's happened?

328
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:07,250
- What's going on here?
- The bucket's caught on something.

329
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:14,375
- It rises!
- Yeah. Let go.

330
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,500
It's coming!

331
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,083
It rises!

332
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,333
A dead dog in the well!

333
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,875
- Get it out!
- Our water! It's poisoned!

334
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:31,041
See? You have already drunk
from the cup of darkness.

335
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,333
Merryboy...

336
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:37,375
This is the work of the Devil.
He has come to stake our land.

337
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:41,041
Who among you has welcomed
the Devil to Union?

338
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Whose lust?

339
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
Whose sin?

340
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:48,333
Oh, foolish Union.

341
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,583
The Devil has come

342
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,958
and cast his darkness over us.

343
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,291
And his darkness grows

344
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,500
within each of us

345
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,041
like a rot.

346
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:21,875
Solomon...

347
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:25,916
I didn't mean to stop by unexpected.

348
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,541
I have just a, uh...

349
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,875
a small thank you.

350
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:37,916
It's for Sarah.

351
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:42,958
What is it?

352
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,250
Can you keep a secret?

353
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,250
And that's when I saw
something in the trees.

354
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,708
A figure.

355
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Who was it?

356
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,708
I don't know. It was so dark.

357
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,291
I thought it was Caleb or...

358
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:59,083
or the widow.

359
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:01,166
But now...

360
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,500
What?

361
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:10,708
Now we are tormented

362
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,583
and the pastor is sick and...

363
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:16,250
and I feel half mad, and now I wonder

364
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,625
if perhaps something is wrong with me.

365
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:23,208
- Sarah...
- And always has been, Solomon.

366
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,625
I was never normal. My own father said so.

367
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:31,041
Maybe I was born wicked

368
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:32,958
and strange.

369
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:36,791
Maybe it was the Devil in the woods.

370
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:40,375
Maybe the Devil is in me.

371
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,416
Stop! You sound like Mad Thomas.

372
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,000
Perhaps Thomas is right.

373
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,583
Thomas is a mindless drunk, nothing more.

374
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:49,916
Look around, Solomon.
There is blight everywhere.

375
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,583
I... I... I grant you that, but you...

376
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:57,833
Hannah was just a dalliance, Sarah.

377
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,625
And if it wasn't?

378
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,125
What do you mean?

379
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,500
That's why I'm so afraid.

380
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:14,916
Do you understand?

381
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:21,041
Because it was not
just a dalliance.

382
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:32,750
I see.

383
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,333
I can't breathe.

384
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,291
Listen to me...

385
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:51,083
Dalliance or not...

386
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,916
one does not summon the Devil by chance.

387
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,541
Even the weakest heart,

388
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,125
the most corruptible soul,

389
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:01,875
they must make the choice.

390
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,583
They must extend their hand,

391
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,541
which you did not do.

392
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,500
- No.
- No.

393
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,125
You can always come to me, Sarah.

394
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,625
My door is always open to you.

395
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,708
Cyrus! Come out!

396
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:30,875
Constance! Where is Constance?

397
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:34,750
- The Devil has locked himself in there!
- Pastor! Pastor!

398
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,291
- Brother! What's happening?
- The pastor.

399
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:40,375
He's locked the children
in the Meeting House. A dozen at least.

400
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:41,958
Henry! Where is Henry?

401
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:48,916
Solomon!

402
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:54,708
Cyrus!

403
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,083
Keep everyone back.

404
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,458
Solomon, wait!

405
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:28,083
Let me in! No!

406
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,291
Stay back.

407
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:32,708
Henry! Henry!

408
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:37,625
Because they are.
We call upon which they call within.

409
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:40,041
Resigned to deficit.

410
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:41,934
- Where's my husband?
- Hold them back!

411
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:43,750
What's happening in there?

412
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:47,708
- Let me go! Let me go! Cyrus!
- Constance!

413
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,583
Cyrus?

414
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:24,291
I can see now.

415
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,958
I can see everything.

416
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,916
Our children!

417
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,125
Our children!

418
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,000
No!

419
00:32:58,166 --> 00:32:59,375
Henry!

420
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,708
Sarah!

421
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:06,833
Cyrus, no!

422
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:12,458
No!

423
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,541
Witchcraft! Witchcraft!

424
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,333
Evil! Show yourself!

425
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:22,375
- Witchcraft!
- Show yourself!

426
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:26,375
Show yourself!

427
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:43,416
Hear ye! Hear ye!

428
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,916
Good people of Union, listen!

429
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,416
There is a dark

430
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,666
and evil force at work here.

431
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,142
If we are ever to end this misery...

432
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,208
Aye!

433
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,833
...then we must root out the guilty.

434
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:57,976
- We must...
- Jakob! Please, Goodman Berman!

435
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,916
The man responsible is dead.

436
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,416
- Pastor Miller...
- The pastor...

437
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,958
Our pastor was a man of God.

438
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,500
- Right.
- And this was not him!

439
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:11,458
- He was possessed by a darkness.
- Yes!

440
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:15,958
My child, my dear Constance,
and many others...

441
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,166
are dead.

442
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,833
Our futures...

443
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:24,541
...many of our entire bloodlines
have been stolen from us.

444
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,166
Someone must pay!

445
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:35,416
I saw some little lambs of our town...

446
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,416
laughing, dallying on the full moon last!

447
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:44,750
There were some of us in the woods,
but there was no...

448
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:49,083
We drank Apple Jack. We danced.

449
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:52,166
We are young. That is not a crime!

450
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:53,583
Heathens!

451
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:56,208
You have sinned! You have sinned!

452
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:58,750
Look upon your children!

453
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:02,000
For they will bear the Devil's mark!

454
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:04,958
<i>Witchcraft!</i>

455
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:07,541
<i>Witchcraft!</i>

456
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:09,541
<i>Yes, witchcraft.</i>

457
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:13,250
But just as my brother Solomon

458
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:16,416
heroically expelled the darkness among us

459
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,125
by killing our afflicted pastor,

460
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:22,666
we too will punish and surmount this evil!

461
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,041
Yes, we will!

462
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:29,541
As survivors, our faces always will remain
toward the sun.

463
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:31,750
Hear, hear!

464
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,958
<i>I traced it on my patrol!</i>

465
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:45,666
This scourge centers on Union proper.

466
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,583
He's right!

467
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:49,916
I've searched the woods.
It does not extend beyond the settlement.

468
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,120
He's right.

469
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,791
It's here! It's in Union!

470
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:59,750
We are being punished,
and I have a list of names!

471
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:02,708
Oh, then show it to us! Show it to us!

472
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:05,500
Enough! Enough!

473
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,458
Listen to yourselves!

474
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,875
Speculation!

475
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,375
Chasing shadows!

476
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:15,166
Imagined curses!

477
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,208
I ask...

478
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:19,833
do you have proof?

479
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,625
No. Or you?

480
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:27,083
Or any of you?

481
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,666
I have proof!

482
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:39,791
It was some nights back when the full moon
had risen just beside the sun.

483
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:41,500
<i>As I lay sleeping,</i>

484
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,833
<i>she came to me.</i>

485
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:49,291
<i>She witched me and led me to the woods.</i>

486
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,791
She was naked...

487
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,125
...and riding a red mule.

488
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,208
Yes.

489
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:01,666
<i>The red mule became a horned man.</i>

490
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,250
And she made me watch
as she lay with the Devil.

491
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,250
- Who?
- Who was it?

492
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:09,833
As <i>both </i>of them lay with the Devil.

493
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:11,750
Both of them?

494
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,625
Hannah Miller and Sarah Fier!

495
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:17,541
- No!
- No!

496
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:19,458
Witches! Witches!

497
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,916
- Witches!
- Witches!

498
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,291
Witches!

499
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:25,083
Witches! Witches!

500
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:27,625
I saw Hannah Miller and Sarah Fier.

501
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:29,333
I saw Hannah Miller.

502
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:30,625
I saw Hannah Miller.

503
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:31,791
I saw Hannah Miller.

504
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,208
I saw Sarah Fier.

505
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,666
- I saw Sarah Fier.
- I saw Sarah Fier.

506
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,250
Witches!

507
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,916
Witches! The witches!

508
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
The witches!

509
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,458
- We need to get away from here!
- And go where?

510
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:07,916
Here! They're here!
Witches over here!

511
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,625
Go! Go!

512
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,666
The Devil is in this

513
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,916
disgusting whore!

514
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,916
No!

515
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,750
Silence! Check her for marks!

516
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:21,708
No! No!

517
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,750
No!

518
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:27,666
No! No!

519
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,125
Be still, witch!

520
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,166
Got one!

521
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:41,125
As sure as the sun rises,
we will purge Union

522
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:42,208
of this...

523
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,333
Witch!

524
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:44,708
...wretched pollution!

525
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,666
We will search every house,

526
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,291
every inch of wood!

527
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,583
We will not rest
and we will not have mercy!

528
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,000
No mercy!

529
00:38:57,083 --> 00:39:01,083
So help me, God,
we will be cleansed of these anathemas!

530
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:04,250
- Yeah!
- We will have our justice!

531
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,541
Yeah!

532
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:08,333
We will find Sarah Fier!

533
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:09,791
Find her!

534
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:10,875
Get up!

535
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:13,416
Find her!

536
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:16,041
Until we find Sarah Fier!

537
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,333
Where are you, Sarah Fier?

538
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,541
Find the witch!

539
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:44,916
Find her!

540
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:48,791
- Father!
- My fault...

541
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:51,500
Father!

542
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:04,083
Did you look upstairs?

543
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,541
I did, there's no one there.

544
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,958
Did you hear that?
The other side of the house.

545
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,000
We'll find her elsewhere.

546
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:33,125
Open up!

547
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:55,625
David!

548
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,791
Take your musket round back
to the Fier house.

549
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,583
Keep an eye on George Fier.

550
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:04,125
Keep an eye out for that witch.

551
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,625
Hannah?

552
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:08,208
What have they done to you?

553
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,500
I am to hang on the morrow.

554
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:16,458
And if you don't flee, you will too.

555
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:17,416
No!

556
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,000
Listen to me.

557
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,208
You need to run.

558
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,750
- No, I won't leave you.
- You must!

559
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:32,500
This is my fault anyway.

560
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:35,750
- No.
- I led the Devil here.

561
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:40,208
That is not how it works.
You do not summon the Devil by chance.

562
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,208
You have to make a choice.

563
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:44,750
Don't you see?

564
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:48,250
It doesn't matter if we did it or not.

565
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,291
They think we're guilty, so we are.

566
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:54,916
You're right.

567
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,750
Everyone believes we've done it.

568
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:04,000
So what difference does it make
if we do now?

569
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,250
- What are you saying?
- I will go back to the widow.

570
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:15,625
I will make a deal with the Devil.

571
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:20,791
Perhaps that can save us.

572
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:22,375
But the Devil...

573
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:24,041
Are you mad?

574
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,583
I don't fear the Devil.

575
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,333
Hannah,

576
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:31,250
I fear the neighbor who would accuse me.

577
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:36,166
I fear the mother
that would let her daughter hang.

578
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,750
I fear Union.

579
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:43,791
They lead us like lambs to the slaughter
and expect us to just follow.

580
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,875
Well, they will see...

581
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:50,500
I am no lamb.

582
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:53,166
<i>Sarah Fier! Come out!</i>

583
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:58,916
When this is over,
we will leave this place.

584
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,041
We will go far away

585
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:03,500
and we'll dance every night,

586
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:06,208
then kiss in the broad daylight.

587
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:16,083
I can't lose you.

588
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:17,750
You won't.

589
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,750
If they want a witch...

590
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:26,291
I will give them a witch.

591
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:03,375
Widow!

592
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:06,125
Mary!

593
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

594
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,541
Away, Elijah.

595
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:18,500
- Elijah, I said enough!
- Please, you have to help me!

596
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:19,666
Sarah?

597
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:22,833
- We're innocent, Solomon.
- I know...

598
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:25,208
Hannah and I, we didn't do this!

599
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:27,833
- You're bleeding.
- It doesn't matter. Listen to me.

600
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:30,583
I went back to the woods, to the widow.

601
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:34,083
- Sarah!
- She's dead, Solomon! Someone killed her!

602
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,500
And there was this...

603
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,750
this book...

604
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:41,250
with a... a kind of instruction,
an incantation.

605
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:44,458
- An incantation? For what?
- Yeah.

606
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:45,750
I think...

607
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:50,125
I think someone struck a deal
with the Devil.

608
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:52,833
Offering our town.

609
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,041
- Our town?
- Yes.

610
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:58,791
In exchange, perhaps, for power?

611
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,166
Solomon, I swear it...

612
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,333
it wasn't me!

613
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:09,041
Sarah...

614
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:16,625
I believe you.

615
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,583
Who else knows about this?

616
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:26,833
No one.

617
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:28,875
Solomon!

618
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:34,625
- Solomon!
- Go! Go quickly! Hide!

619
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:41,666
Solomon!

620
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,041
Solomon!

621
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:50,208
Open up, Solomon!

622
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,250
We're looking for Sarah Fier.

623
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,583
There's no one here but me.

624
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:01,208
Then we're free to search.

625
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:02,791
Of course you are not.

626
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,166
Do not try to intimidate me, Caleb.
I am not some child!

627
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,833
Come out! Sarah!

628
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:14,633
If only your word was enough,
Solomon.

629
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:17,583
What's in the back room, Solomon?

630
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,083
Sarah Fier!

631
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:36,208
Sarah Fier!
Come out, Sarah Fier!

632
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,333
If there's nothing there,

633
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:41,541
let me check.

634
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:44,000
What do you have to hide?

635
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,541
I'll tell you once more.
There's no one here, but me.

636
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:55,375
Sarah Fier! Go around the back!
She's gotta be here somewhere!

637
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:02,875
Leave immediately,
or I'll make you leave.

638
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:06,875
Come on!

639
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:12,666
Go on...

640
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,000
All of you, go on!

641
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,333
<i>Abbadon...</i>

642
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:29,416
Ahriman...

643
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:31,583
Azazel...

644
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,750
Bael...

645
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,416
You!

646
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:48,750
It's you!

647
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:56,583
<i>Rimmon...</i>

648
00:50:58,583 --> 00:50:59,666
<i>Samael...</i>

649
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:02,083
Lucifer...

650
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,875
Gorgon...

651
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:09,083
Beelzebub...

652
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:13,166
Morning Star...

653
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,083
Satan.

654
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:23,875
It's you.

655
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:25,375
I'm still me.

656
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,083
I've always been me.

657
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:33,166
Only I've grown tired of watching fortune
turn a blind eye to me.

658
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,916
How could you?

659
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,166
How could I what? Take what we all want?

660
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,791
What we all came here for?

661
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:43,791
Power, prosperity, legacy.

662
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:45,333
Consider, Sarah...

663
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:47,833
a single soul...

664
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:50,666
Cyrus Miller.

665
00:51:54,916 --> 00:51:56,083
Just one.

666
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:57,750
Pastor Miller.

667
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:59,041
And in return...

668
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,125
what no amount of praying
could ever bring.

669
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:07,833
One person every few years
seems a small price to pay.

670
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,125
One person?

671
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:13,666
The pastor slew 12 children!

672
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:18,083
- My brother! Innocents!
- Innocents.

673
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,000
Who's innocent?

674
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:25,375
Your neighbors hunt you,

675
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:28,875
forsake you, curse your name!

676
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:30,541
Everywhere is ignorance!

677
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:32,250
Dread!

678
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:34,958
Yet you resign yourself to it!

679
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:44,000
They're afraid
because they know you're different.

680
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:48,375
And you are.

681
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:55,833
Someone who refuses to settle
for the rules of these dogmatists,

682
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:58,041
who seeks more from the world.

683
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:04,541
You're like me.

684
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,625
I am nothing like you!

685
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,583
No!

686
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:20,875
Argh!

687
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:35,541
Sarah!

688
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,250
Sarah!

689
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:51,000
Sarah!

690
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:03,916
Sarah?

691
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:07,666
Sarah!

692
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,375
Sarah, come back to me!

693
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:19,458
<i>Sarah...</i>

694
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:25,125
Sarah!

695
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:26,625
Sarah!

696
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,375
Sarah!

697
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:06,166
Sarah!

698
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:48,333
No!

699
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:51,125
No! No, no, no, no!

700
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:53,000
- Stop, stop, stop!
- No!

701
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,208
- Stop it!
- No!

702
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:56,541
- Stop it! Stop, stop, stop!
- No, no!

703
00:55:56,625 --> 00:56:00,041
Please, do not make me hurt you!
I love you, Sarah! I love you!

704
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:02,333
Stop fighting! I don't want to hurt...

705
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,583
No!

706
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:08,625
No!

707
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:13,500
No! No!

708
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:15,625
No!

709
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:10,875
I found the witch!

710
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:14,666
Told you she was a witch!

711
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:17,750
No, no!

712
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,333
The penalty
for practicing witchcraft

713
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:00,375
is death by hanging!

714
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:02,625
Hang them!

715
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:04,166
Hang them!

716
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:07,625
Confess!

717
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:12,375
Confess your sins or burn in eternal hell.

718
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,666
- Hang her!
- Confess!

719
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:18,666
Confess!

720
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:21,833
Confess!

721
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:23,750
Hang them!

722
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:42,000
I confess.

723
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:45,625
No! No!

724
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,375
I confess!

725
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:51,416
- No! She's lying!
- I walked with the Devil!

726
01:00:53,041 --> 01:00:54,500
I lay with him!

727
01:00:55,541 --> 01:00:57,583
I bewitched the good pastor.

728
01:00:58,666 --> 01:00:59,958
And I bewitched...

729
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:02,458
Hannah Miller.

730
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:07,458
I clouded her mind.

731
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,416
I clouded her mind.

732
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:13,750
It was me.

733
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:18,833
It was me!

734
01:01:21,416 --> 01:01:22,708
It was only me.

735
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,250
It was always me.

736
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:33,541
- Hannah's innocent.
- Let her go.

737
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:38,458
No!

738
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,333
No! No! No!

739
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,208
The truth will come out.

740
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,750
Maybe not today...

741
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:04,291
and maybe not tomorrow,

742
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:05,791
but it will.

743
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:09,875
The truth shall be your curse.

744
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:13,916
It will follow you for eternity.

745
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:17,750
I will shadow you forever.

746
01:02:19,208 --> 01:02:21,208
I will show them what you've done.

747
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,833
I will never...

748
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:26,791
let you go.

749
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:33,166
- Hang her!
- Hang her!

750
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,166
Witch!

751
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,375
Hang the witch!

752
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,833
The truth will come out.

753
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:10,458
Maybe not today.

754
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:13,083
Maybe not tomorrow,

755
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,625
but it will.

756
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:18,291
We can't just leave her here,

757
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:21,208
alone underneath this tree.

758
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:24,000
She deserves a proper burial.

759
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:26,916
Let's move her,
bury her somewhere else.

760
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:32,333
So no one else knows where she is.

761
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:34,458
Except us.

762
01:03:56,875 --> 01:04:00,208
The truth shall be your curse.

763
01:04:04,791 --> 01:04:07,291
I will shadow you for eternity.

764
01:04:10,625 --> 01:04:12,458
I will follow you forever.

765
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:20,083
And everything you take

766
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:22,625
and everyone you harm,

767
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:24,375
you will feel the grip

768
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:26,416
of my hand.

769
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,041
I will show them what you've done.

770
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:45,666
I will never let you go.

771
01:06:23,541 --> 01:06:24,875
Sheriff Goode!

772
01:06:37,916 --> 01:06:38,916
You OK?

773
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:43,500
Need help?

774
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:47,541
Uh... Uh, no, sir. I'm good over here.

775
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:49,041
Middle of the night.

776
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:51,666
What brings you back here?

777
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,250
Where's your sister?

778
01:06:57,166 --> 01:06:58,166
Officer...

779
01:06:58,958 --> 01:06:59,958
Huh?

780
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:01,666
Josh!

781
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:17,250
What the hell?

782
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:19,041
It's him!

783
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,000
Josh!

784
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:25,916
Your sister is very confused.

785
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,875
His dad and his grandpa
and his great grandpa!

786
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:29,958
What?

787
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:32,541
She's clearly suffering
from some kind of a...

788
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:34,833
a breakdown.

789
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:38,958
She needs help.

790
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:40,750
Josh?

791
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:43,750
Goode is evil!

792
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:26,625
I was back in time. I was Sarah Fier,
and Sarah Fier was innocent.

793
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:30,291
She isn't turning people in Shadyside
into killers. She wasn't a witch!

794
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:34,791
<i>We have a 5150 in possession of car 961.</i>

795
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:37,333
<i>- Suspects on their way.</i>
- Josh! Listen! Solomon Goode...

796
01:08:37,416 --> 01:08:38,250
Who?

797
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:40,041
Nick Goode's Pilgrim ancestor

798
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:43,500
made a deal with the Devil, then framed
Sarah to cover his own Puritan ass.

799
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:44,625
Deena!

800
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:51,958
The Goodes, they're trading us.
People from Shadyside.

801
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:55,625
Lucifer... Samael... Satan...

802
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:58,875
- <i>Goode gives a name to the Devil.</i>
- Ryan Torres.

803
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:08,184
- <i>The Devil takes over that person.
- Ryan!</i>

804
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:09,208
What?

805
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:12,333
Then that person kills and murders.

806
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:17,666
<i>And the Devil feeds on this blood
of dead Shadysiders.</i>

807
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:30,916
And Goode gets whatever he wants.

808
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:32,916
<i>He becomes Sheriff.</i>

809
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:35,791
<i>His brother becomes mayor.</i>

810
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:38,708
All of Sunnyvale gets better and better.

811
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:44,166
And Shadyside doesn't.

812
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:49,666
And the Goodes do it over and over,
again and again.

813
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:53,458
<i>One Goode from every generation
passing down the evil.</i>

814
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:57,000
- <i>Solomon...</i>
- Cyrus Miller.

815
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:01,708
- <i>Solomon's son.</i>
- Isaac Milton.

816
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,000
William Barker.

817
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:07,583
- <i>Firstborn to firstborn.</i>
- Harry Rooker.

818
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:09,291
Ruby Lane.

819
01:10:10,083 --> 01:10:11,791
Thomas Slater.

820
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:13,375
<i>Right to today.</i>

821
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:16,934
- Abbadon, Ahriman...
<i>- Right to Sheriff Nick Goode.</i>

822
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,916
- So, Sarah Fier...
- He framed her!

823
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,666
She's the only one
who's ever figured out the truth...

824
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:24,916
until us.

825
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,125
And the killers came after us
to keep us from uncovering it.

826
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:30,875
Yes, to protect Goode's deal
with the Devil.

827
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:34,000
But... but, Deena?

828
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,625
Yeah, Josh?

829
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:38,583
<i>If the killers
were after us before...</i>

830
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:44,333
<i>now that we know the truth,
now we know about Goode's deal...</i>

831
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:47,333
...what happens now?

832
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:22,916
Oh, Jesus Christ!

833
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Look at her! I told you it wouldn't work!
There's no ending it.

834
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:32,583
What is it?

835
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:35,458
We need to talk.

836
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:39,000
Thank you, King of Sunnyvale,

837
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:42,166
for rescuing poor helpless Shadysider me!

838
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:47,958
- Now.
- Now.

839
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:52,708
This is how we save Sam.

840
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:55,083
Nick Goode. Nice to meet you.

841
01:11:57,708 --> 01:11:59,458
How we save Shadyside.

842
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:02,083
<i>Being the heir apparent
isn't always easy either.</i>

843
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:04,166
What if that's not who I want to be?

844
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:06,583
You believe me, right? About the curse?

845
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:08,166
Yeah, of course.

846
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:10,708
I've let a lot of people die...

847
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:14,291
- Nick, this isn't your fault.
- But not you. I'm not letting you die.

848
01:12:18,916 --> 01:12:20,458
We can't kill the Devil.

849
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:22,166
The curse, it's...

850
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,833
it's real.

851
01:12:24,458 --> 01:12:25,541
So...

852
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:28,416
<i>we have to kill him.</i>

853
01:12:30,708 --> 01:12:32,166
We need to kill Nick Goode.

854
01:12:34,916 --> 01:12:37,541
But I called him... I thought...

855
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:40,833
I thought he could help.

856
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:43,750
We need to go. Now!

857
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,750
I wanted to do that all day.

858
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:06,458
- Should be up here on the right.
- Are we sure about this?

859
01:13:08,916 --> 01:13:12,208
<i>♪ Mo murda, mo murda, come again...</i> ♪

860
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:18,125
<i>♪ Mo murda, mo murda, come again... ♪</i>

861
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:22,791
You gotta be kidding me.
Yo, man, I wasn't doing nothing.

862
01:13:23,291 --> 01:13:24,833
Minding my business.

863
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:26,416
Hey!

864
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:28,833
- Urkel?
- Yeah!

865
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:30,833
Uh...

866
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:34,416
Wanna help us kill Sheriff Goode?

867
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:38,041
Let me get my coat.

868
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:41,916
As the mall's
lead custodial engineer,

869
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,833
I ensure that all retail establishments

870
01:13:43,916 --> 01:13:46,208
come equipped with the StoreSafe 250.

871
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,708
This is the Cadillac of store gates.

872
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:51,791
Now, the 250 prevents
your standard smash-and-grab, graffiti,

873
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:55,625
all while complying with the 70%
visibility ordinance. Best part...

874
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:02,375
Easy to operate.

875
01:14:02,458 --> 01:14:04,625
And we can rig them for quick release?

876
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:08,208
Little grease, these things go down faster
than a Sunnyvale cheerleader.

877
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:10,333
So, Deena is the target now,

878
01:14:10,416 --> 01:14:13,708
so the killers will go after Deena's blood
just like they did with Sam.

879
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:16,916
And then we use that to lure them
into the stores, and then...

880
01:14:20,791 --> 01:14:22,708
Welcome to the clink, motherfucker.

881
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,416
The killers will be locked up,
then it's us versus Goode.

882
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,750
OK, sure, awesome, but then what?

883
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:30,000
Like how do we take out Goode?

884
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:31,791
Are y'all serious about this?

885
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:36,000
Once they're down, how quickly
can we get the gates back open?

886
01:14:36,083 --> 01:14:38,500
- Depends, but...
- Why would we want to do that?

887
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:41,833
Looks like blood.

888
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:43,666
<i>Carrie, </i>cool.

889
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:46,250
We'll <i>Carrie </i>him.

890
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:02,958
Seriously?

891
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:07,250
Look at this dumbass thing.
It's bigger than a tape deck.

892
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:10,750
If you want to hear more than one album,
you got to carry all that too.

893
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:12,416
It skips if you breathe on it.

894
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:16,208
Then listen to the radio, dude.
We have a situation here.

895
01:15:16,791 --> 01:15:21,166
Yeah, about that, Urkel.
Um... what's really going on here?

896
01:15:23,583 --> 01:15:26,416
OK. OK, OK. OK!

897
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,791
Cool. There's a half-possessed
tied-up white girl.

898
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:32,708
I need you to stay calm, alright?
I promise we got this all under control.

899
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:36,166
- OK.
- She's one of them, we'll save her.

900
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:38,750
We're gonna kill Sheriff Goode
and save Shadyside.

901
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:42,083
OK.

902
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:46,375
Any tips for fighting these things?

903
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:49,125
Yeah.

904
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,666
Try not to die.

905
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:03,208
- <i>Here?
- Yes!</i>

906
01:16:03,291 --> 01:16:04,291
<i>Dig, dig!</i>

907
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:05,250
Dig!

908
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:09,375
Get ready to run.

909
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:11,916
- <i>No, Cindy, no! No, no!
- Let's go!</i>

910
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
This is it.

911
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:20,750
Yep.

912
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:30,125
Hang her! Hang her! Hang her!

913
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,875
What's that?

914
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:48,666
Never seen a goody bag?
All cops got 'em, for emergencies.

915
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,208
This one's Sheriff Goode's.

916
01:16:50,791 --> 01:16:53,416
Full of useful stuff.
There was this one ti...

917
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:58,791
<i>I'll tell you again.
Somebody planted that.</i>

918
01:16:58,875 --> 01:17:00,666
Those ain't my cans.

919
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:02,291
You're right, Martin.

920
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:05,583
These are actually my cans.

921
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:08,416
Son of a bitch.

922
01:17:27,166 --> 01:17:28,166
Deena?

923
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:33,166
I wanted to see if you wanted
one of these, uh... headlamps.

924
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,625
I know it looks pretty dumb, but...

925
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:37,625
It's perfect.

926
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:45,916
Up, up... down, down.

927
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,375
Left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

928
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:49,750
What?

929
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:52,708
It's the Konami Code.

930
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:54,208
It's what you need.

931
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:55,875
It's what we all need.

932
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:57,458
I have no idea what...

933
01:17:57,541 --> 01:17:59,583
It's the ultimate secret code.

934
01:17:59,666 --> 01:18:02,333
<i>Super Contra, Castlevania, Teenage Mutant...</i>

935
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:08,875
It's a code for extra lives.

936
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:13,166
When things get bad
at school or whatever, it's...

937
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:14,583
it's what I think about,

938
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:16,583
and it helps me...

939
01:18:17,416 --> 01:18:19,875
I don't know, to survive.

940
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,125
You are the biggest nerd.

941
01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:31,541
You smell like an androgynous baby.

942
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:35,291
Everyone says Shadyside sucks
because it's full of shitty people,

943
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:39,208
that bad things happen here
because we're bad,

944
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:42,583
that we deserve what we have coming.

945
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,125
That's how it was for Sarah,

946
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:48,375
and that's how it's been for us.

947
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:51,166
But it's all bullshit.

948
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:54,500
OK, just because we're weird

949
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:57,083
and smart and different

950
01:18:57,750 --> 01:19:01,125
doesn't mean they can feed us
through their meat grinder.

951
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:02,541
Not anymore.

952
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:04,208
It's been three centuries.

953
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:06,000
No one else has gotten this far.

954
01:19:06,083 --> 01:19:08,791
It stops here... tonight.

955
01:19:08,875 --> 01:19:10,125
It stops with us.

956
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:14,458
We're gonna kill this motherfucker.

957
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:18,083
For Sarah,

958
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:19,916
for Kate and Simon.

959
01:19:21,916 --> 01:19:23,000
For Cindy.

960
01:19:25,291 --> 01:19:26,541
For all of us.

961
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:30,791
