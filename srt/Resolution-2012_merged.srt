1
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:36,489
What are you gonna surround me?

2
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:41,241
Oh! You don't belong here.

3
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:45,519
F*ck you! You put it down.

4
00:00:45,523 --> 00:00:46,675
Where are you goin?

5
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:48,317
Ah!

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,883
Daddy hurt himself.

7
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:54,881
Ha-ha-ha, it's not
gonna fit you!

8
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:57,589
And you don't do
that to a friend.

9
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,797
Oh, God!

10
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:06,598
Oh, no!

11
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,648
Ah-h-h!

12
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,250
It's a horrible idea.

13
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:00,553
Look, if he says no,

14
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:04,656
I'll just come back home.

15
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,759
It's stupid

16
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,634
and selfish.

17
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:17,869
Be safe, okay?

18
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,639
Okay.

19
00:02:28,747 --> 00:02:30,590
6:45 M.A.

20
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,353
Woo!

21
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:43,589
You're wearing the hat now?
That's fine, that's fine.

22
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,555
Hey, don't take it off.

23
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:47,793
No, I got a hat hook for ya.
Right over there.

24
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,427
Just sit there.

25
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:51,763
Glorious!

26
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,965
It's glorious!

27
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:56,734
Oh, Christmas!

28
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:58,469
Oh, Santa Claus.

29
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,673
Chris!

30
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:02,875
Chris, it's Michael.

31
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,543
Can I come up?

32
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:07,779
Who?

33
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,416
Mike Danube, your best friend.

34
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,484
Yeah, man.

35
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:16,386
Just don't scare away
the birds though.

36
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:17,856
Seriously.
Okay.

37
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,990
Do not scare the birds!

38
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:21,693
Okay, I'm coming up, all right?

39
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:26,063
Don't shoot, okay?

40
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:28,644
Sure.

41
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:41,778
Holy shit, man!

42
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:43,847
Fucking Mike!

43
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:45,650
How the fuck are ya, man?

44
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:47,684
I'm good, man, I'm good.

45
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:48,419
You?

46
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,023
Oh, God, fucking
fantastic, man.

47
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:52,091
Fucking living the dream, man.

48
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,792
Isn't this fucking the tits?

49
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:55,960
Yeah.

50
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,963
Yeah, it's, uh, something else.

51
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,397
Yeah.

52
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:01,766
How'd you find this place?

53
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,501
You sent me a map.

54
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:04,869
Fuck, I did?

55
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,635
Goddamn, man,
these fucking bugs

56
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:08,637
are trying to fucking
get me, dude.

57
00:05:08,638 --> 00:05:11,876
They're trying to eat me like they
got this goddamn tree over here.

58
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:12,976
Yeah, I read about that.

59
00:05:12,977 --> 00:05:15,014
It's a parasite,
a beetle, right?

60
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:17,080
Yeah, yeah.

61
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:19,516
It fucking flies, too.
Did you know that?

62
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:20,884
A lot of people
don't know that.

63
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:23,955
I wouldn't give a shit if they
ate the entire tree, but no,

64
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,522
they fucking leave
it like a dick

65
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:28,427
to fucking remind me that
they'll fucking eat me.

66
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,629
Oh, fucking shut the fuck up!

67
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,164
I swear to God
these fucking birds

68
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:36,666
are just fucking take
my shit all the time

69
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,004
and they will not
fucking shut up.

70
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:43,708
Oh, God, eat my fucking...

71
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,076
I got drinks, man,
you want a drink?

72
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:45,777
Sure.

73
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,651
Come on, man, let's
get fucking drinks.

74
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:54,852
Come on.
Okay.

75
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:56,185
Mike, it is good to see you.

76
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:58,488
Seriously, I am glad you
got to see this place.

77
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:00,858
It's a very special place to
me and you get to see it.

78
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:01,826
I'm happy.

79
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:04,095
Yeah, of course.

80
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:06,731
Oh, God.

81
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:08,532
You look, uh...

82
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,802
You lost a, a ton of weight.

83
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,171
Oh, yeah, I can
see my dick now.

84
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:16,877
Crack-kins,
huh?

85
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:20,677
You've been busy.

86
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:21,844
Fuck yeah I've been busy, man.

87
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:22,947
The inspiration,
I'm telling you,

88
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:26,049
it just fucking
flows through me

89
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,518
like a river of...

90
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,791
Crap, where's my fucking pipe?

91
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,826
Okay.

92
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:37,695
All right.

93
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:40,164
Give me my pipe, dude.

94
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:41,898
I don't have it.

95
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:44,768
Mike, fuck you.

96
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:46,572
Give me my fucking
pipe right now!

97
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,705
I don't have your pipe.

98
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:49,973
Mike, you fucking asshole!

99
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:54,111
No, don't fucking judge me with
your shitty fucking eyes goddamnit.

100
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:55,912
Really?

101
00:06:55,913 --> 00:06:57,449
It was the fucking birds.
You're right, I gotcha.

102
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,784
Okay, here it comes.

103
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,053
Shit! Godda... Oh,
fucking bullets.

104
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,987
Out of fucking bullets!

105
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:05,088
Goddammit, man!

106
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:06,858
Chris, it's okay, man, all right?
I see your pipe.

107
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:07,891
You see it?

108
00:07:07,892 --> 00:07:10,061
Yes, yes, it's outside, okay?

109
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,831
I'm, I'm gonna go outside
and I'm gonna get it.

110
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,266
Okay. I'm gonna bring
it back to you.

111
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,266
Bring it back.

112
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:17,000
Just have a seat on your
mattress and chill out.

113
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:17,702
You're the boss.

114
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:19,637
All right, I'll
be waiting here.

115
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:20,338
All right.

116
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,507
You're a good friend, Michael.

117
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,207
Yeah.

118
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,076
I'm sorry this had to happen
when you came to visit me.

119
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:27,811
Oh.

120
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:32,148
Oh, fuck Mike, you're
a fucking lifesaver.

121
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:34,990
Oh, God.

122
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,031
Oh, there we go.

123
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,002
Oh, God.

124
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,236
Fuck, man.

125
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:53,305
That's a lot better, dude.

126
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,573
Fuck, that was a close one.

127
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:57,281
Oh, God.

128
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,881
Sorry, man.

129
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:06,656
For what?

130
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,223
All right, look, I came here

131
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,659
to ask you one last time.

132
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,029
Can we get in my truck
and take you somewhere?

133
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:19,964
Oh, come on, dude, no way, man.

134
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:21,099
This...

135
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,765
Mike this is my fucking
destiny, man, you know that.

136
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:24,567
All I'm asking is
that you get clean

137
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:25,702
for one week, okay?

138
00:08:25,703 --> 00:08:27,139
If after that you
want to go back

139
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,073
to dying here, that's fine.

140
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:29,575
No.

141
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,775
No way.

142
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:32,576
Okay.

143
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:36,147
All right.

144
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,114
Well, goodbye.

145
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:38,782
What?

146
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:39,717
Mike, don't fucking...

147
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:42,119
Here, dude, don't leave.

148
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,054
Finish your drink, man.

149
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,355
Come on, sit down.

150
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:47,792
Come on, finish your drink.

151
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,864
Sit down, finish your
drink, talk to me.

152
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:53,564
How's...

153
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:54,732
How's your wife?

154
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:58,035
How's, um... Jennifer. Jennifer.

155
00:08:58,036 --> 00:08:58,935
Is good.

156
00:08:58,971 --> 00:08:59,837
Jennifer's good, right?

157
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:01,339
Okay, that's good.

158
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,142
Is she still mad at
me about the wedding?

159
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,176
Yes.

160
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:05,877
Really?

161
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,878
Yeah, actually, yeah, nobody,

162
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,780
nobody really likes you
very much right now.

163
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:12,082
Oh, that sucks.

164
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,019
You can fix it.

165
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:15,352
Oh, God, there's no...

166
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:16,054
Do you remem...

167
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,388
I don't think I can fix that.

168
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:20,995
God.

169
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:27,797
Oh God, Mike, I got
a fucking dog.

170
00:09:27,798 --> 00:09:28,531
Can you believe that?

171
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:29,801
I finally got a fucking dog.

172
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,768
It's so fucking awesome.

173
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,203
She doesn't live here,

174
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:35,104
but she visits me every day.

175
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:37,308
We're, uh, we're writing
a book together

176
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:39,143
on, uh, squirrels.

177
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:40,210
Her idea.

178
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:42,246
When's the last time you slept?

179
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:43,214
Oh, fuck.

180
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:47,350
Jeez, I don't know.

181
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:48,885
Well, all right.

182
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:49,387
Really?

183
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,120
Yeah.

184
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,089
You're leavin'?

185
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,129
All right, man.

186
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:01,231
In seven days the last
molecule of that shit

187
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:02,272
will be leaving your body.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,037
After that, you wanna die,

189
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,806
I will throw you the key,

190
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:10,676
and you'll never see me again.

191
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,343
Mike, what are ya doing?

192
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:14,110
Mike, what the fuck?

193
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:17,248
Look, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna go to the store.

194
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,316
I'll be back in a half hour.

195
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,917
Mike!

196
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,418
Mike, fuck off!

197
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,286
Mike, take this fucking off me

198
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:24,387
right fucking now!

199
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:25,289
Try and sleep it off.

200
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,090
Michael!

201
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:28,426
Fuck you, Mike!

202
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,227
Are you fucking kidding me?

203
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:31,428
Mike!

204
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:31,930
Mike!

205
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:33,998
Oh, my fucking God, Mike,

206
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,431
you're a fucking dead man!

207
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:38,202
Fucking let me out
of this fucking thing!

208
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:39,436
Michael!

209
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:42,229
Oh, fuck!

210
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:05,297
I tried, there's no,

211
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,731
there's no signal at the cabin.

212
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,465
Yeah, he, uh, he
says he's gonna try.

213
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:11,937
He was being
surprisingly agreeable.

214
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,038
So...

215
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,182
Yeah, I know, it is a miracle.

216
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:25,383
I know, I know, there're much

217
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,224
bigger responsibilities.

218
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,490
Well, hey.

219
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:35,759
Well, hi, where'd
you come from?

220
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,894
What's your name?

221
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:40,931
Hey.

222
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:42,298
Hi.

223
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:43,105
Hi.

224
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:48,138
Pretty dog.

225
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,010
Hey.

226
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,445
Where'd you get that?

227
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:56,279
My pocket.

228
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,383
I don't want my
teeth to fall out.

229
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:04,220
Michael, when you were gone

230
00:12:04,221 --> 00:12:08,158
I took a long, hard
look at myself.

231
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,326
You're right.

232
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:12,529
I'm pretty fucked up.

233
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,231
I need to go to rehab.

234
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:17,201
I'm ready, man.

235
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:21,806
I'm ready for you
to take me to rehab.

236
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,374
Let's do this.

237
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,311
Uncuff me.

238
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:28,380
What are you doing?

239
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,314
Why are you doing that?

240
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:33,817
Mike, let me out
of the fucking cuffs.

241
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:37,588
Do you know why
Jimi Hendrix died?

242
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,254
He didn't have Mike Danube

243
00:12:39,255 --> 00:12:41,491
and a set of handcuffs
to save his life.

244
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:43,493
Here, you're gonna need
water and calories.

245
00:12:43,494 --> 00:12:44,393
It's an empty bag anyway.

246
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:46,228
Hey, I found someone
you know outside.

247
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:47,164
Are Billy and Micah outside?

248
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:49,134
No, you still talk
to those degenerates?

249
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,302
They're my drug dealers.

250
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:54,537
Oh my God, Sara!

251
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:56,040
Kill Mike.

252
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,040
Kill Mike, Sara.

253
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,407
I found an address on her tags.

254
00:12:58,408 --> 00:13:00,844
I should probably take
her back to her owner.

255
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:02,344
Oh yeah, great idea, Mike.

256
00:13:02,345 --> 00:13:03,881
Take away the only thing
in life that keeps me

257
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:06,222
from killing myself.

258
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:13,424
She has a really
good imagination.

259
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,859
Hey, some ointment
for your wrist.

260
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,392
I'm gonna fire up some
chili, you want some?

261
00:13:17,393 --> 00:13:19,496
Does it got crack
in it, motherfucker?

262
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:22,398
Okay, at least drink something.

263
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,004
I read that the dehydration
will only make this worse.

264
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:28,037
Thank you for this.

265
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:29,477
I appreciate it.

266
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:08,512
Please, Michael.

267
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:11,017
Please.

268
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,119
I need it.

269
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,524
Please, Michael.

270
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:23,494
Please, Michael.

271
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,562
Please.

272
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:30,500
I need it, Michael.

273
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:34,370
Please.

274
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:38,274
Please, Michael.

275
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:42,379
I need it.

276
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,115
Please.

277
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:50,254
Please, Mike.

278
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:54,291
I need it, Mike.

279
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:57,427
Please.

280
00:14:57,428 --> 00:15:01,165
Please, Mike.

281
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,630
Please, Michael.

282
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,731
Give me the fucking key, Mike!

283
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:36,333
Give me the fucking key, man!

284
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:38,768
Fuck!

285
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:40,937
Oh... Oh.

286
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,645
Fuck.

287
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:50,684
Oh.

288
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:55,565
Oh.

289
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,710
Oh, God.

290
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,077
Wake up you little bitch.

291
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:22,614
Yo, come out, don't be
keeping all that stuff

292
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,751
for your dirty
carpet mining self.

293
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:29,653
Oh, shit!

294
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:31,488
Mike Danube and shit.

295
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:33,724
Fuck, what up, dog?

296
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:36,094
I didn't know you
was into chicken?

297
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,564
Where's Chris?

298
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:42,633
Yo, Chris!

299
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,569
Chris!

300
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,504
He all whooped already?

301
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:49,105
No, he's, uh, he's sick

302
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:50,672
and he's taking a break,

303
00:16:50,673 --> 00:16:51,708
but I'll, uh, I'll let him know

304
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:54,545
you guys stopped by.

305
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:55,645
Y'all are getting all spracked

306
00:16:55,646 --> 00:16:56,712
on our shit in there, huh?

307
00:16:56,713 --> 00:16:57,615
You tell him, dog.

308
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,651
Yeah.

309
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:01,652
Use that shit.

310
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,756
I fucking dare you.

311
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:07,591
Come on.

312
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:10,560
All right then.

313
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:14,797
Now I see how it is.

314
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,535
Yo, Chris,

315
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:20,303
we're gonna come back
later go fishing.

316
00:17:20,304 --> 00:17:22,104
I'm telling you, motherfucker.

317
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:23,307
If we don't get
that blue belly,

318
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:27,544
we're gonna have
some problems, yo.

319
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:29,784
Fucking cunt.

320
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:33,487
Faggot.

321
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,621
Oh, what the fuck?

322
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,654
Are you fucking dealing?

323
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:40,491
I wish I was fucking dealing.

324
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,594
What's the gun for?

325
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,795
Protection.

326
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:47,663
Protection from what?

327
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:48,397
The birds.

328
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:50,602
Okay, there are
no birds, Chris.

329
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,507
You have meth psychosis.

330
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,606
The gray man.

331
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:58,642
The gray man, yes of course.

332
00:17:58,643 --> 00:18:00,575
Mike, the government
issues each

333
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:01,878
and every one of us
a shadow man.

334
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:03,546
Billy and Micah stopped by.

335
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:04,779
Billy and Micah are fucked up.

336
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,847
Don't fuck with
those guys, dude.

337
00:18:05,848 --> 00:18:07,816
You know, I never thought
that you would end up

338
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:08,685
as bad as them.

339
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:09,819
I fucking...

340
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,689
I'm kidnapped, asshole,
and you're jud...

341
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,191
You're a self-righteous
asshole!

342
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:15,759
They said that you have
something of theirs.

343
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,261
God.

344
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:20,462
All right, man, fucking
last fucking month

345
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:22,599
my check didn't come
and fucking so they

346
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,268
shared with me.

347
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,636
Oh, God.

348
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:28,673
Provided I just fucking
pay 'em back this month.

349
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,207
Okay.

350
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,543
Where is it?

351
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,877
You found it already.

352
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:38,248
The rest of it.

353
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,383
Okay.

354
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:43,964
Come on, dude, you know I'm
gonna find it eventually.

355
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:55,732
Mike, please just
give me a hit of it.

356
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:58,735
Mike, seriously.

357
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:00,604
Mike, I...

358
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:02,338
I know I sound ridiculous
'cause you hear...

359
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,788
Just plea...
Just I... You don't just go cold turkey.

360
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:09,772
What'd you do with it?

361
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:11,606
Mike, you can't fuck around
with this stuff, man.

362
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:12,842
I didn't do anything, okay?

363
00:20:12,843 --> 00:20:13,642
I just picked this stuff up

364
00:20:13,643 --> 00:20:15,644
and I brought it straight here.

365
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:16,948
There was nothing
else down there?

366
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,449
No, just a shitload of guns,

367
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,051
that box, and these
like a little story.

368
00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:23,686
Mike, this is not good, man.

369
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:25,787
Look, I know right
now it probably feels

370
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:27,858
like you're not gonna make it,
but you're gonna be all right.

371
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:31,528
Oh God, I owe Micah and Billy.

372
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:34,365
They're not the same guys
from high school, Mike.

373
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,499
I saw Billy hit a girl so hard

374
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,902
her fucking eyeball popped
out of her fucking head.

375
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:40,871
What are these?

376
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,739
They're fucking
some photos I found

377
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,043
by the stone house.

378
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,809
I was gonna sell 'em
at the flea market.

379
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,812
And they were just
lying there in the dirt?

380
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:51,615
You find all kinds
of shit out here.

381
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:54,851
People do rituals.

382
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:55,852
So, you've got government

383
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:58,387
and devil worshipper problems?

384
00:20:58,388 --> 00:20:59,628
I'm really fucking tired, Mike.

385
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:02,992
This is probably the point

386
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:06,329
where you're gonna wanna
sleep for a few days.

387
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:11,101
Oh, God, fuck off.

388
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:12,892
I'm going for a walk.

389
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:36,361
That's exactly what
Jedediah was saying

390
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:39,996
about the metamorphosis
of the tadpole.

391
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:42,031
Hey, how's it going, man?

392
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:43,366
Good, thanks.

393
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:45,402
Right on, right on.

394
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:48,872
Hey, uh, if you
don't me asking,

395
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:51,842
what, uh, what are
you doing out here?

396
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:55,412
Oh, I'm, uh, just
visiting my friend.

397
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:56,912
Very cool, very cool.

398
00:21:56,913 --> 00:21:58,546
The only reason I'm
asking is that we come

399
00:21:58,547 --> 00:22:00,585
out here just about
every day after prayer

400
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,719
and we never see anyone ever.

401
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,954
So, this is awesome.

402
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,956
I'm Justin.

403
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,891
Um, hi.

404
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:09,992
I'm, I'm Michael.

405
00:22:09,993 --> 00:22:11,796
Michael, it's fantastic
to meet you.

406
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:12,929
This is David.

407
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,431
Hi.

408
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:15,966
And this is Aaron.

409
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,835
- How ya doing, brother?
- Good.

410
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:20,937
Yeah.

411
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:23,405
So, you guys are like
in a church group?

412
00:22:23,406 --> 00:22:24,606
Basically, basically.

413
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:27,809
Our whole thing is just making
sure that people know that

414
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,451
the celestial Messiah
will land his vessel

415
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:34,048
before the end of days.

416
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,145
Why are you freaking out?

417
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Fuck!

418
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,047
Holy shit!

419
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:12,548
Holy shit!

420
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:13,949
What, what's happening?

421
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,951
There's somebody outside.

422
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:16,653
Do they have my stuff?

423
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:17,922
No, it's some girl.

424
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,124
She looks crazy,
or sick, or some shit.

425
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,893
Oh, God.

426
00:24:23,894 --> 00:24:24,927
You're not scared?

427
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:30,133
No, man, she's probably from the new
age mental health house up the street.

428
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:32,003
They wander out all the time.

429
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:34,285
Oh.

430
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,985
Rise and shine, cunts!

431
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:50,624
Oh, fuck.

432
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:54,890
Give me my gun, Mike.

433
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:56,626
Mike, don't leave
here without a gun.

434
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:58,127
Mike, don't be stupid.

435
00:24:58,128 --> 00:24:59,796
Fuck.

436
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:02,199
Just give me the crizzy
and we'll bounce.

437
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,268
Look, Billy, we don't
have your shit, okay?

438
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:07,736
Look, Chris either smoked
it all or he lost it,

439
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:10,040
I don't know, but I can
write you a check right now

440
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,708
for whatever he owes you

441
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:12,809
if you'd be willing
to call it even.

442
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,177
No, fuck that shit.

443
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:15,777
Come on, Chris, give me
the fucking twizz, bitch.

444
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:17,248
Fuck you, Billy! I
don't owe you shit.

445
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,115
Shut the fuck up!

446
00:25:20,116 --> 00:25:23,119
Look, Bill, I will give
you more than enough money

447
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,954
to buy some more, okay?

448
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:26,355
- Billy.
- Yeah?

449
00:25:26,356 --> 00:25:28,224
Someone's coming
up the hill, dog.

450
00:25:28,225 --> 00:25:29,793
All right, fuck you.

451
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:31,932
Fuck you, Danube.

452
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:36,097
What are you doing here?

453
00:25:36,098 --> 00:25:38,334
I'm, uh, I'm just
visiting my friend.

454
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:40,635
Yeah, what the fuck's
your friend doing here?

455
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:41,905
Hey, Mike, who is that?

456
00:25:41,906 --> 00:25:44,074
Don't let 'em know I'm in here.

457
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,142
I'm, uh, Michael.

458
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:48,778
Charles.

459
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:49,711
Is there a problem?

460
00:25:49,712 --> 00:25:53,283
Yeah, there's a problem.
This is my goddamn building.

461
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:55,987
Oh, so Chris, Chris
didn't pay his rent?

462
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:58,153
Who the fuck is Chris?

463
00:25:58,154 --> 00:25:59,389
Shit.

464
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:04,095
Look, um, I'm trying to get him out
of here and I need less than a week.

465
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:07,096
Is there anyway we can
work something out?

466
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:08,965
Well, that would be impossible.

467
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:13,135
See, that's
the reservation border.

468
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:14,638
We're on a reservation?

469
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:19,174
You need tribal council
approval to stay here.

470
00:26:19,175 --> 00:26:21,177
Okay, look, um,

471
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:23,211
how 'bout I write
you a check right now

472
00:26:23,212 --> 00:26:25,816
and five days from now you will
never know we were even here?

473
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,116
Are you serious?

474
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:30,085
Yeah.

475
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:32,221
Tell you what.

476
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:35,191
To bring me cash tomorrow

477
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:38,965
you call this number.

478
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:44,266
And I want this place
cleaned up in five days.

479
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:45,135
Do you understand me?

480
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:48,171
I do.

481
00:26:48,172 --> 00:26:50,441
A lot of drug addicts
buried in these hills,

482
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,887
you know that?

483
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:04,687
You're squatting.

484
00:27:04,688 --> 00:27:05,756
You're squatting.

485
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,191
No, man, we're squatting.

486
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:13,962
I mean, don't you get money from
welfare, or unemployment, or something?

487
00:27:13,963 --> 00:27:14,863
Well, the owner was out there.

488
00:27:14,864 --> 00:27:16,931
Billy and Micah are
coming back, Mike.

489
00:27:16,932 --> 00:27:18,132
You never know when
but they always come back,

490
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:19,834
and they're gonna
fucking kill us.

491
00:27:19,835 --> 00:27:23,072
Oh, and did you know you're
on an Indian reservation?

492
00:27:23,073 --> 00:27:24,472
How the fuck am
I supposed to know

493
00:27:24,473 --> 00:27:27,209
what an Indian reservation is
or what private property is?

494
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,178
Check a map you fucking idiot.

495
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:30,446
I'm a fucking junkie, Mike.

496
00:27:30,447 --> 00:27:31,747
I move every two weeks when

497
00:27:31,748 --> 00:27:33,414
I'm not fucking
chained to a pipe.

498
00:27:33,415 --> 00:27:35,017
Do you have any idea
what tribal security

499
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:37,854
would do to us if they
caught us here?

500
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:39,088
Whatever they want.
Yeah.

501
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:40,389
Yeah, okay, so
fucking uncuff me.

502
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,824
Let's get the fuck out of here.

503
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:43,059
No, I'm gonna pay
'em for five days.

504
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,728
What?
We'll be fine.

505
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:47,963
Well, I hope you got a good fucking
deal 'cause this place really sucks.

506
00:27:47,964 --> 00:27:48,831
What is that smell?

507
00:27:48,832 --> 00:27:50,196
I shit in the bucket.

508
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,366
The man said that
it was worth more,

509
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:32,568
wouldn't do that to you.

510
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:35,438
Where's the rest?

511
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:38,441
There isn't any more.

512
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:41,477
I'm not lying to you.

513
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:43,013
What is that?

514
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:45,047
No!

515
00:29:45,048 --> 00:29:46,316
God, please!

516
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:47,983
Please!

517
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:49,419
Please!

518
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,433
Please!

519
00:30:37,433 --> 00:30:39,134
What was that?

520
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:40,970
Some weird story.

521
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:41,837
Yeah.

522
00:30:41,838 --> 00:30:45,408
Well, the air weighs
a billion pounds

523
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:49,479
and I itch all over still.

524
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,582
Hey, where did you
find those pictures?

525
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,450
Told ya, man, by that
stone house thing.

526
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:55,586
Near the stove thing?

527
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,987
Yeah.

528
00:30:57,988 --> 00:31:00,154
There's a weird record
with a story in there.

529
00:31:00,155 --> 00:31:02,259
There's weird shit
everywhere, man.

530
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,327
There's some weird
tires by the river.

531
00:31:05,328 --> 00:31:06,996
Why don't you grab that?

532
00:31:06,997 --> 00:31:09,065
Why'd you send me the video?

533
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:10,366
I didn't send you a video.

534
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:12,302
Yeah, you did.

535
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:14,537
The link you emailed me.

536
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:17,374
Mike, do you see a computer
or a camera around here, man?

537
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,174
I sold all that shit

538
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:23,445
a year ago to shitty Carl.

539
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:25,548
What are ya, gonna surround me?

540
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:27,150
Oh!

541
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,952
I don't think I sent you that.

542
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,453
Yeah, you sent it
to me with a map.

543
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:34,590
Look, dude, you haven't
slept in like two days

544
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:37,226
and my brain is
fucked, obviously,

545
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:39,495
so why don't you uncuff me

546
00:31:39,496 --> 00:31:42,966
before you go crazy?

547
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:47,438
Yeah, you're right,
I need sleep.

548
00:32:22,172 --> 00:32:24,508
Hey, I found this library
book on our doorstep.

549
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,241
Oh, that's fantastic.

550
00:32:26,242 --> 00:32:27,344
Do you wanna uncuff me now?

551
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,243
It's cool.

552
00:32:28,244 --> 00:32:30,778
It's like a collection of
fiction writing or something.

553
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:33,180
God, my legs are
starting to cramp up.

554
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:35,285
There's a bunch of like
campfire ghost stories.

555
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,585
It's a...

556
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:39,721
Oh God, they're really
starting to hurt.

557
00:32:39,722 --> 00:32:41,258
Hey, I'm gonna go pay that guy.

558
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:44,093
Do you need anything?

559
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:47,162
Yeah, some food would be good.

560
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:49,175
Uh...

561
00:32:59,175 --> 00:33:02,116
Can you hand it to me, man?
I can barely fucking move.

562
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:09,694
There. Thank you.

563
00:33:18,694 --> 00:33:23,365
Just fucking kill me, man.

564
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:25,601
Seriously, just fucking
grab a gun and kill me.

565
00:33:25,602 --> 00:33:26,702
Look, Chris, I'm obviously

566
00:33:26,703 --> 00:33:28,770
I'm not an expert, okay,

567
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:30,604
but I read that this
is normal, okay?

568
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:32,841
You're gonna feel weak, and
you're gonna feel helpless,

569
00:33:32,842 --> 00:33:34,178
but eventually,
little by little,

570
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,380
you will get better.

571
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:38,747
I'm not gonna fucking
be able to do this, man.

572
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:39,581
Yes, you can.

573
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:40,414
Yes, you can.

574
00:33:40,415 --> 00:33:41,050
Trust me on this.

575
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:44,487
You can do this, okay?

576
00:33:44,488 --> 00:33:45,521
You have my word
you're not gonna die.

577
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:46,521
Fuck.

578
00:33:46,522 --> 00:33:49,101
Just fucking kill me.

579
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:57,602
Hey.

580
00:33:57,733 --> 00:33:59,843
Hey.

581
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,143
You have four days.

582
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:10,846
Got it, thank you.

583
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:14,517
Um, hey, hey, Charles?

584
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:17,351
My sincerest apologizes
on behalf of both of us.

585
00:34:17,352 --> 00:34:18,286
It doesn't matter.

586
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:19,755
If I were you, I'd leave.

587
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:22,725
Ain't nothing you
can do for him.

588
00:34:22,726 --> 00:34:28,163
Hey, can I ask you
a quick question?

589
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:29,831
With all due respect, um,

590
00:34:29,832 --> 00:34:31,501
why is no one living
in the place?

591
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:36,138
I mean, why not, you know,
finish it off and rent it?

592
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,639
We rent it out
to tribal members

593
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,876
but it got burnt in the fires.

594
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:43,312
We couldn't afford to rebuild.

595
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:46,681
I'm sorry to hear that.

596
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:48,355
Thank you again.

597
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,318
Hi.

598
00:35:22,318 --> 00:35:26,221
So, these are just
there in its place?

599
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:27,490
Yeah, it's bizarre, right?

600
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:29,773
No, I don't care.

601
00:35:43,773 --> 00:35:47,246
Another story with
a fucked up ending.

602
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:50,846
What do you think?

603
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,681
About what?

604
00:35:52,682 --> 00:35:55,750
Do you think someone's leaving
these stories for us to find?

605
00:35:55,751 --> 00:35:58,355
I think people leave
their shit everywhere

606
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,457
and you fucking
take it personally.

607
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,792
I don't know, Billy and Micah?

608
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:05,360
The chick in the window?
I don't know, the fucking dog?

609
00:36:05,361 --> 00:36:10,299
Like why would somebody be
leaving stuff for us to find?

610
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,735
I don't fucking know, Mike.

611
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,736
Who gives a shit, man?

612
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:16,706
I got bigger fucking
problems than your

613
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,726
fucking faggot recordings.

614
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:38,995
Seriously?

615
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,763
Alcohol has never
been your problem.

616
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:42,863
Actually, no, I won't say that.

617
00:36:42,864 --> 00:36:44,768
If you have problems
when you drink,

618
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:48,337
you have a drinking problem.

619
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:50,872
What the fuck are
you talking about?

620
00:36:50,873 --> 00:36:55,778
Denise "The Beast" Price.

621
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:57,748
Why you gotta
bring up old shit?

622
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:00,649
She's easily the fattest girl,

623
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,985
I think, that has ever
walked the planet.

624
00:37:02,986 --> 00:37:05,821
I was wasted, man.

625
00:37:05,822 --> 00:37:07,757
I literally saw her
eat an entire block

626
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,426
of Velveeta cheese
in one sitting.

627
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:12,829
We were making nachos
and the stove was broken.

628
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,332
There's no excuse
for that, dude.

629
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,833
You had sex with
"Grody" Jody Jenkins.

630
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:19,534
I was in college.

631
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:21,604
I was hammered.

632
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:23,772
She looked like John Madden.

633
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:24,674
No way.

634
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,642
Oh, yeah, she was
a punisher of eyes.

635
00:37:27,643 --> 00:37:28,923
Well, it's not as
bad as the hogs

636
00:37:29,012 --> 00:37:30,614
that Dale used
to bang, remember?

637
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,781
Oh, man, Dale was the man

638
00:37:32,782 --> 00:37:33,942
'cause he owned it, you know?

639
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:35,417
He had an opinion,

640
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:36,985
he didn't care, and he
just went for it.

641
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:39,889
He didn't give a shit who
fucking cared about it.

642
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,435
To Dale.

643
00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:41,474
To Dale.

644
00:37:57,474 --> 00:37:58,774
Chris.

645
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:01,710
Oh my God, I feel like shit.

646
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:04,046
But in a different way.

647
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:08,417
Where did this come from?

648
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:10,721
You were looking at
it when you passed out.

649
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,053
I was?

650
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:14,909
No, I have no idea.

651
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:09,979
Well, I mean, you know,
it's hard to tell.

652
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,181
Um, you know, we'll have
to see after, you know,

653
00:39:12,182 --> 00:39:13,948
we get back, but, uh,

654
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:17,021
yeah, I'm, uh, I'm
really optimistic.

655
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:22,424
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm
going a little stir crazy

656
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:25,627
and I miss you a lot.

657
00:39:25,628 --> 00:39:27,930
How ya feeling?

658
00:39:27,931 --> 00:39:31,433
Yeah, but I mean it's
just the mornings, right?

659
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:34,103
Okay, well then, yeah,
I guess you better

660
00:39:34,104 --> 00:39:36,171
tend to that.

661
00:39:36,172 --> 00:39:38,956
I love ya.

662
00:40:24,621 --> 00:40:26,522
Can I go down to the
stream and wash off?

663
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:28,656
Nope.

664
00:40:28,657 --> 00:40:30,092
Can I change my clothes?

665
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:33,529
I'm not changing mine.

666
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,598
Man, you have no faith in me.

667
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,633
Look, if that were the case,

668
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:38,800
I wouldn't be here.

669
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:42,203
I just, uh, don't have very
much faith in you right now.

670
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:44,939
Yeah, likewise.

671
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,075
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm fucking talking about.

672
00:40:48,076 --> 00:40:49,510
Dude, you keep coming
here with these

673
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:51,646
shitty recordings
and these stupid stories

674
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:54,050
about how you found 'em, and
you're fucking acting weird.

675
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:54,751
I'm...

676
00:40:55,018 --> 00:40:56,550
Okay, I'm not like making

677
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:57,918
this shit up, all right?

678
00:40:57,919 --> 00:41:00,123
I think someone might
be messing with us.

679
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,223
Maybe you have a...

680
00:41:02,224 --> 00:41:03,704
split personalities
and you're leaving

681
00:41:04,027 --> 00:41:06,594
each other gifts
and shit for you to find.

682
00:41:06,595 --> 00:41:07,963
Do you want some water?

683
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:11,299
No, I'm good.

684
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,943
Oh, great, more shitty
fucking recordings.

685
00:41:20,943 --> 00:41:22,076
You fucking...

686
00:41:22,077 --> 00:41:24,715
Ah-h-h!

687
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:29,984
That's impossible.

688
00:41:29,985 --> 00:41:32,988
That could be fucking filmed
from right outside the window.

689
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:35,857
Then where's, uh,
where's the glare?

690
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:37,157
Okay, where's,
where's the glass

691
00:41:37,158 --> 00:41:38,992
if it's outside the window?

692
00:41:38,993 --> 00:41:40,994
It's not fucking HD,
Mike, it's dog shit.

693
00:41:40,995 --> 00:41:45,901
That could be filmed from right
outside the fucking window.

694
00:41:45,902 --> 00:41:47,342
What, you think it's
Billy and Micah?

695
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:49,972
I think some fucking
kids up the street

696
00:41:49,973 --> 00:41:52,040
are just fucking with ya.

697
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,043
You really think so?

698
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,676
Mike, I don't...

699
00:41:54,677 --> 00:41:56,144
I'm fucking starving, Mike,

700
00:41:56,145 --> 00:41:57,979
and if you don't stop
talking about this

701
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,048
goddamn shitty
recording business

702
00:42:00,049 --> 00:42:03,217
and fucking start preparing us some
food, I'm gonna fucking strangle myself

703
00:42:03,218 --> 00:42:04,721
with my fucking shoelaces, man.

704
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,989
I swear to God.

705
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:11,060
Make me beans,
or food, or something.

706
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,762
Yeah, I'll pick up
some stuff for dinner.

707
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,196
Oh, God, thank you.

708
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:16,000
Do you want me to go with you?

709
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,734
Hey, could I, uh,

710
00:42:52,735 --> 00:42:56,839
could I talk to you
for a second?

711
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,573
Thank you.

712
00:42:57,574 --> 00:42:58,740
You need to be out of there.

713
00:42:58,741 --> 00:43:01,210
No, I know, I just wanted
to ask you about something.

714
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:04,178
There's a, there's
a shed down the hill

715
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:05,847
from your place,
do you know why

716
00:43:05,848 --> 00:43:07,916
there's a bunch of playback
equipment in it?

717
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:10,123
Shouldn't be in there.

718
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:17,825
I found this journal in there and it was
written all in French, and I was...

719
00:43:17,826 --> 00:43:21,864
Yeah, yeah, we rented it out to a bunch
of French students to research something.

720
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,366
You need to leave.

721
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:29,203
Did you talk to them?

722
00:43:29,204 --> 00:43:33,841
They said they were
researching folktales.

723
00:43:33,842 --> 00:43:36,210
That's it?

724
00:43:36,211 --> 00:43:38,686
They didn't say anything else?

725
00:43:43,686 --> 00:43:47,458
They asked a lot
about the caverns.

726
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,292
All right, thank you.

727
00:43:50,293 --> 00:43:52,030
We're coming in two days.

728
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,264
I think obviously
we need a kitchen,

729
00:43:57,265 --> 00:43:58,298
some granite countertops.

730
00:43:58,299 --> 00:43:59,969
Of course, granite's probably

731
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,272
not gonna pencil out,

732
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,338
but the thing is it's your

733
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:06,208
God-given right
to be happy.

734
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:08,343
Oh, hey, you must be Mike.

735
00:44:08,344 --> 00:44:09,844
Mike, Ted, Ted Tellensworth.

736
00:44:09,845 --> 00:44:10,577
How ya doing?

737
00:44:10,578 --> 00:44:11,912
I was just telling Chris here

738
00:44:11,913 --> 00:44:15,184
how it looks the wool's been pulled
over our collective eyes, so to speak.

739
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,752
Mm-hm.

740
00:44:16,753 --> 00:44:19,788
Oh, we're not
interested in, um,

741
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:20,356
I'm, I'm Catholic.

742
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:21,756
I understand.

743
00:44:21,757 --> 00:44:25,259
California, bless their liberal
bedwettin' ACLU card carrying hearts,

744
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,195
allowed you two newly weds to
consummate your bond.

745
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,329
Then you guys move into this
place after some wheeling, dealing,

746
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,768
dickhead mortgage broker
sells you guys an Option ARM

747
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,968
with a NegAm balloon payment.

748
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:36,206
No kids, expendable
incomes turned out to be

749
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:39,942
a real financial
nightmare for you guys.

750
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:41,344
You guys just want
to feel right again.

751
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,910
No, okay, we're not...

752
00:44:42,911 --> 00:44:46,146
Mike, I'm not here to decide who's
the cub and who's the bear.

753
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:47,782
What I am here to tell ya,

754
00:44:47,783 --> 00:44:51,353
that cash out loan the bank's
tellin' ya isn't possible?

755
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:54,223
Right here in this briefcase.

756
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,959
That whole "We buy
houses for cash"

757
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,993
I'm that guy.

758
00:44:57,994 --> 00:44:58,992
He's that guy, Mike.

759
00:44:58,993 --> 00:45:01,095
Ted, tell him how much
we could probably get.

760
00:45:01,096 --> 00:45:02,295
Hold your horses, sunshine.

761
00:45:02,296 --> 00:45:04,898
The thing is, I'm gonna need
to see some loan paperwork,

762
00:45:04,899 --> 00:45:07,068
maybe a deed, whatever
you guys have on hand,

763
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:08,235
and we could probably
work this thing out.

764
00:45:08,236 --> 00:45:09,137
Mike, we have that right?

765
00:45:09,138 --> 00:45:10,838
Why don't you just
give us a retainer now...

766
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:13,441
Wait, wait. So, you're
a mortgage broker?

767
00:45:13,442 --> 00:45:16,744
Uh, Michael, let's just say what I
used to be able to do on the phones,

768
00:45:16,745 --> 00:45:19,313
probably served better in this
economy going door to door.

769
00:45:19,314 --> 00:45:21,115
So, you're not
a mortgage broker.

770
00:45:21,116 --> 00:45:23,219
You guys are obviously
doing what you guys do.

771
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,120
I do what it is I do.

772
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:27,220
Nobody talks about maybe
what we can do together,

773
00:45:27,221 --> 00:45:28,456
and, uh, if we do
this thing right,

774
00:45:28,457 --> 00:45:29,423
we trust each other,

775
00:45:29,424 --> 00:45:32,295
we could probably all
profit from this thing.

776
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,529
We're renting.

777
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:35,465
I'll be damned.

778
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,198
Of course you two are.

779
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:40,133
Chris, admittedly, I'm
a little bit embarrassed.

780
00:45:40,134 --> 00:45:42,375
Sorry for wasting
your guys' time.

781
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,176
Oh, and, um, Michael,

782
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,012
I'd hate to have either
one of our businesses

783
00:45:50,012 --> 00:45:54,415
disrupted by maybe some
business that didn't happen.

784
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:56,919
Did you read my
notes on the, uh,

785
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,319
on the squirrels?

786
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,257
You know, you really fucked
us on that deal, Mike.

787
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,390
What?

788
00:46:02,391 --> 00:46:04,325
Why didn't you follow my lead?

789
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:07,329
I mean, just follow my lead, man. I
would have split the money with you.

790
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,564
God, we have real trust issues.

791
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:10,900
You're eating a real meal.

792
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,366
This is amazing.

793
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:13,900
Yeah, well, I sleep all day,

794
00:46:13,901 --> 00:46:18,272
and I mostly want to kill myself when I'm
awake, but sure I'm a little hungry.

795
00:46:18,273 --> 00:46:21,109
Well, I'm really
happy about that.

796
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:24,144
If I had crystal meth in my
hand and a gun in the other,

797
00:46:24,145 --> 00:46:26,382
I would have a hard
time choosing.

798
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:27,616
But you're hungry?

799
00:46:27,617 --> 00:46:30,285
Yeah, fine, I'm hungry.

800
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:33,155
Hey, so I figured out where
all the equipment came from.

801
00:46:33,156 --> 00:46:34,455
I'm really hungry.

802
00:46:34,456 --> 00:46:36,892
It turns out it belonged
to a group of researchers.

803
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:38,260
I found their journal.

804
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:39,160
Really?

805
00:46:39,161 --> 00:46:41,162
They just left all
that stuff up there?

806
00:46:41,163 --> 00:46:44,866
Man, if I would've found that stuff,
I would've sold it and bought drugs.

807
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:47,168
Well see, that's the thing I don't get
is like why would they just leave

808
00:46:47,169 --> 00:46:48,170
all that stuff, you know?

809
00:46:49,005 --> 00:46:52,040
It's 'cause they
don't exist, I think,

810
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:53,309
and you just believe everything

811
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,483
people tell you.

812
00:47:01,483 --> 00:47:03,352
What?

813
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:04,150
Take a look at it.

814
00:47:04,151 --> 00:47:04,851
I really...

815
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:06,288
I'm really hungry.

816
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:08,925
Take a look at the journal
and I'll feed you.

817
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:09,427
Okay.

818
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:11,526
See what it says.

819
00:47:11,527 --> 00:47:14,162
Um...

820
00:47:14,163 --> 00:47:16,230
Nikola Tesla.

821
00:47:16,231 --> 00:47:17,531
Fer...

822
00:47:17,532 --> 00:47:19,402
Mike, this is in
a different language.

823
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,970
Do you notice anything else?

824
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:24,171
It says "telekinesis" a lot.

825
00:47:24,172 --> 00:47:27,307
Look, man, there are a lot
of weird people out here.

826
00:47:27,308 --> 00:47:29,510
Okay, are you sure you don't
know who shot that video?

827
00:47:29,511 --> 00:47:31,774
No, I'm not sure, man.
I was high as fuck.

828
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:35,384
Okay, take a look at
the clip one more time.

829
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:37,217
Mike, my blood sugar is low,

830
00:47:37,218 --> 00:47:38,385
and I'm about to pass out.

831
00:47:38,386 --> 00:47:40,086
Will you please give me beans?

832
00:47:40,087 --> 00:47:43,358
You know, you really fucked
us on that deal, Mike.

833
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,326
What?

834
00:47:44,327 --> 00:47:46,460
Why didn't you follow my lead?

835
00:47:46,461 --> 00:47:49,564
What the fuck?

836
00:47:49,565 --> 00:47:52,568
- Am I fucking brain damaged?
- You're eating a real meal.

837
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:54,502
This is amazing.

838
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:55,635
Yeah, well I sleep
all day and...

839
00:47:55,636 --> 00:47:57,271
Mike, if my fucking
mind is mush,

840
00:47:57,272 --> 00:47:59,240
don't make me go through this.

841
00:47:59,241 --> 00:48:00,323
Dude, just calm down, okay?

842
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,544
I'm...
Fuck.

843
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:05,382
I'm seeing the same thing.

844
00:48:07,382 --> 00:48:10,451
It's satellites.

845
00:48:10,452 --> 00:48:11,185
What?

846
00:48:11,186 --> 00:48:11,886
Yeah, man.

847
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,021
I don't know how
they work either

848
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,555
but that's satellites.
That is government satellites

849
00:48:15,556 --> 00:48:17,305
and they have... They
watch everything.

850
00:48:18,027 --> 00:48:20,428
Chris, why would the
government be watching you?

851
00:48:20,429 --> 00:48:22,463
Why would the government
be watching you, Mike?

852
00:48:22,464 --> 00:48:24,532
Look, I don't know
what you've done.

853
00:48:24,533 --> 00:48:26,068
I came here to help you, okay?
That's it, that's all.

854
00:48:26,568 --> 00:48:27,636
Bullshit.

855
00:48:27,637 --> 00:48:29,503
You came here to help
yourself and you know it.

856
00:48:29,504 --> 00:48:30,572
You're absolutely right.

857
00:48:30,573 --> 00:48:32,441
I'm, I'm actually, I am,

858
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:34,576
I'm a government spy, yeah.

859
00:48:34,577 --> 00:48:36,410
Or no, wait, maybe I'm,

860
00:48:36,411 --> 00:48:38,713
I'm a mass murderer
child molester.

861
00:48:38,714 --> 00:48:41,048
Oh, now you're just being a dick.
I'm trying to tell you, man,

862
00:48:41,049 --> 00:48:42,450
someone's fucking following us.

863
00:48:42,451 --> 00:48:44,050
If someone's following us,

864
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:46,420
why don't you uncuff me so
we can get away from them?

865
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:47,556
Will you go into rehab?

866
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:48,689
Oh, here we go.

867
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:51,192
I don't know, Mike.

868
00:48:51,193 --> 00:48:53,528
If you don't go in, you'll die.
You know that?

869
00:48:53,529 --> 00:48:54,730
Will you go in?

870
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:57,465
Look, I don't know
and this is retarded.

871
00:48:57,466 --> 00:48:59,568
Look, if five days got
you from no to maybe

872
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:03,437
then I'm willing to risk it.

873
00:49:03,438 --> 00:49:05,139
If you're trying
to atone for all

874
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:09,176
those times we were kids and I saved
you from getting your ass just beaten,

875
00:49:09,177 --> 00:49:11,213
this is a shitty way
of going about it.

876
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:12,381
You saved me?

877
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:15,150
You punched like a wind sock.
It's horrifying.

878
00:49:15,151 --> 00:49:17,584
If your wife ever sees
you punch anybody,

879
00:49:17,585 --> 00:49:18,552
you are in deep shit.

880
00:49:18,553 --> 00:49:20,153
She's gonna leave you
for a stronger man.

881
00:49:20,154 --> 00:49:21,521
You know, your lack
of belief in my

882
00:49:21,522 --> 00:49:23,557
good intentions
here is disturbing.

883
00:49:23,558 --> 00:49:26,628
Yeah, well, when your
friend holds you hostage,

884
00:49:26,629 --> 00:49:29,230
you get a different
perspective.

885
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:31,566
It's like a little story.

886
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:32,567
Little story.

887
00:49:32,568 --> 00:49:35,404
Little story.

888
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:36,240
Little story.

889
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,343
Made some coffee,
you want some?

890
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:43,345
I'm sleeping.

891
00:49:43,346 --> 00:49:45,646
It's good coffee, man,
you should try it.

892
00:49:45,647 --> 00:49:46,815
Does it have crack in it?

893
00:49:46,816 --> 00:49:49,750
Kind of.

894
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:50,451
Here.

895
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:57,259
Hey, do you know about any,
uh, any caves nearby?

896
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:00,194
Yes.

897
00:50:00,195 --> 00:50:01,561
Drive to the end of the road,

898
00:50:01,562 --> 00:50:03,199
and then there's some stables,

899
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,167
and then a dirt trail.

900
00:50:06,168 --> 00:50:10,705
Take that, and then you will find
the, uh, Mexican trafficking cave.

901
00:50:10,706 --> 00:50:12,607
Trafficking cave?

902
00:50:12,608 --> 00:50:13,808
Yeah.

903
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:15,445
No really, but Billy
and Micah thought

904
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:18,647
it was this Mexican
drug trafficking cave.

905
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:20,146
I was like, "Why
would anyone build

906
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:21,782
a tunnel fifty miles
from Mexico?"

907
00:50:21,783 --> 00:50:24,353
But they're like,
"We're gonna get rich."

908
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,419
Tweakers.

909
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,155
Are you, uh, are you cool
if I go check it out?

910
00:50:27,156 --> 00:50:29,658
I feel like I need a walk.

911
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:32,526
What about mountain lions?

912
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:34,129
What about them?

913
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,329
Since 1983, the mountain
lion population

914
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,766
of this town has increased

915
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:40,167
staggeringly and steadily.

916
00:50:40,168 --> 00:50:43,739
Right now, there's like 13
mountain lions per person.

917
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,707
Yeah, I think, uh,
I think I'll be fine.

918
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:48,842
You should take my
mountain lion gun.

919
00:50:48,843 --> 00:50:50,679
You have a mountain lion gun?

920
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,879
Mm-hm.

921
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,682
I'm just, I'm gonna
take my chances.

922
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:56,384
All right, man.

923
00:50:56,385 --> 00:50:56,886
Yeah.

924
00:50:57,052 --> 00:50:59,720
You know, on a side note, I'm
not feeling too bad today.

925
00:50:59,721 --> 00:51:00,722
I feel pretty sweet.

926
00:51:00,723 --> 00:51:01,857
Good.

927
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,825
If you got energy, I will
leave you my laptop here.

928
00:51:04,826 --> 00:51:07,130
There's some, there's some games
on it if you wanna play.

929
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:08,562
Thank you.

930
00:51:08,563 --> 00:51:09,698
You're welcome.

931
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:13,201
I will.

932
00:51:13,202 --> 00:51:15,775
Is this a camera?

933
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:22,817
Hey, girl, hey.

934
00:51:27,817 --> 00:51:29,284
That was a warning, Danube!

935
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:32,610
I want my tish!

936
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:57,346
Look, I know this
is a dark moment

937
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,747
but it does get better.

938
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:04,585
You keep fucking saying that,
man, but you don't get it.

939
00:52:04,586 --> 00:52:08,290
This is the worst of it, okay?

940
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:11,426
Just make it to tomorrow.

941
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:15,296
Mike, I never enjoyed life

942
00:52:15,297 --> 00:52:17,399
until I started doing drugs.

943
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,634
Okay, I know that's not true.

944
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:22,203
It is true.

945
00:52:22,204 --> 00:52:25,306
Our childhood I was miserable.

946
00:52:25,307 --> 00:52:29,810
Our adolescence fucking sucked.

947
00:52:29,811 --> 00:52:32,246
The only time I ever
felt happiness was

948
00:52:32,247 --> 00:52:33,548
when I did a line of speed off

949
00:52:33,549 --> 00:52:36,283
some chick's dresser
at a party.

950
00:52:36,284 --> 00:52:38,653
I saw you happy before that.

951
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:41,288
Nah, man, I was being polite.

952
00:52:41,289 --> 00:52:43,325
I'm happy on meth.

953
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,392
Look, life gets better, okay?

954
00:52:45,393 --> 00:52:48,230
You, you were just
dealt a shitty hand.

955
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,598
Oh, Jesus, man.

956
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:54,236
My parents.

957
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,271
I do drugs 'cause
my body chemistry

958
00:52:56,272 --> 00:52:58,906
makes me wanna do drugs.

959
00:52:58,907 --> 00:53:01,641
If I had your parents you
know what I'd be, man?

960
00:53:01,642 --> 00:53:03,579
I'd be a guy with rad
parents who fucking

961
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,747
loves doing drugs.

962
00:53:06,748 --> 00:53:10,451
I mean, God,
I fucking hate people.

963
00:53:10,452 --> 00:53:11,721
Fuck, man, you know
what people do?

964
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:15,025
They fucking kill dogs.

965
00:53:16,025 --> 00:53:18,560
You, me, and fucking those apes

966
00:53:18,561 --> 00:53:22,696
that killed Sara.

967
00:53:22,697 --> 00:53:24,598
We're all the same.

968
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:27,836
The only difference is that
I fucking liked Sara.

969
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:30,372
I loved that dog.

970
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,341
I mean, I just...

971
00:53:33,342 --> 00:53:35,710
I'd rather just do
drugs and end it

972
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:39,381
on my terms rather
than a virus,

973
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:43,884
or global warming, or some
shit just killing me slowly.

974
00:53:43,885 --> 00:53:46,519
This is not the same guy that
painted the picture on my wall.

975
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,858
Being creative it's,
it's, it's not...

976
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:50,959
It's a curse.

977
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,764
It condemns you to a life of failure
'cause you can't sustain interest

978
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:59,788
in any boring rat race job long
enough to make a living at it.

979
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:02,537
I'm creative, I make a living.

980
00:54:02,538 --> 00:54:04,407
You make, you're
a graphic designer, man,

981
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:08,576
you make pamphlets
and DJ fliers.

982
00:54:08,577 --> 00:54:11,046
You're a fucking sellout.

983
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:14,915
All right, well, you know why none
of this bothers me is because

984
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:16,818
I can't believe a word
that's come out

985
00:54:16,819 --> 00:54:19,888
of your mouth in
the last three years.

986
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,688
Why don't you let me go then?

987
00:54:21,689 --> 00:54:23,893
Everyone you've
ever known thinks

988
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:26,593
that you're a liar and a thief.

989
00:54:26,594 --> 00:54:29,662
You know, you tricked us too many times
into thinking you were pulling it together.

990
00:54:29,663 --> 00:54:31,798
Mike, when you
and I were fucking

991
00:54:31,799 --> 00:54:33,833
partying and doing
dumb shit together,

992
00:54:33,834 --> 00:54:36,370
I was doing drugs and you
didn't give a shit then.

993
00:54:36,371 --> 00:54:39,809
Oh, okay, so I guess then I'm,
uh, I'm like your enabler.

994
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,910
Call it whatever
the fuck you want, man.

995
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:45,045
Some of this shit
is your fault.

996
00:54:45,046 --> 00:54:46,681
We all believe
in the possibility

997
00:54:46,682 --> 00:54:48,783
that you're sick.

998
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:51,885
We think about all the fucking horrible
things you've done in your life

999
00:54:51,886 --> 00:54:53,989
and which ones we should
hold you accountable for.

1000
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:55,656
You're saying I'm sick?

1001
00:54:55,657 --> 00:54:57,523
I never called it
a fucking illness

1002
00:54:57,524 --> 00:54:58,606
or any of that shit at all.

1003
00:54:59,027 --> 00:55:00,928
So, fuck off.

1004
00:55:00,929 --> 00:55:03,531
We all have temptations, okay?

1005
00:55:03,532 --> 00:55:05,833
But most of us, we keep
them in check.

1006
00:55:05,834 --> 00:55:07,603
We keep them under control
so we don't hurt

1007
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,104
the people around us.

1008
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,838
You know, man, there
is a, there is a solid

1009
00:55:10,839 --> 00:55:13,608
possibility that you're
just fucking selfish.

1010
00:55:13,609 --> 00:55:16,044
No fucking shit

1011
00:55:16,045 --> 00:55:18,413
I'm fucking selfish, man!

1012
00:55:18,414 --> 00:55:19,546
Fuck.

1013
00:55:19,547 --> 00:55:20,947
The only reason
you're fucking here,

1014
00:55:20,948 --> 00:55:23,516
and I'm chained to
this fucking pipe,

1015
00:55:23,517 --> 00:55:25,853
is so that you can have
something to fucking save

1016
00:55:25,854 --> 00:55:27,922
and fucking feel
good about yourself.

1017
00:55:27,923 --> 00:55:29,857
But guess what, Michael,

1018
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:31,891
you're no fucking
better than anyone else

1019
00:55:31,892 --> 00:55:34,563
and your fucking life is
as meaningless as mine

1020
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:38,767
and I swear to fucking God
that I'm gonna fucking sue

1021
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:40,034
the shit out of you when

1022
00:55:40,035 --> 00:55:43,990
this fucking shit is done.

1023
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:06,694
I, uh, will be back
later tonight.

1024
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:09,728
I'm really sorry about Sara.

1025
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1026
00:57:13,728 --> 00:57:15,096
Ah-h-h!

1027
00:57:15,097 --> 00:57:18,273
Sorry.

1028
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:28,042
Ow, fuck.

1029
00:57:28,043 --> 00:57:28,803
No, I'm just tired,

1030
00:57:28,811 --> 00:57:32,981
and I, uh, I sprained my ankle,
you know, on our morning jog.

1031
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:35,088
So...

1032
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:43,691
Actually, the, um, the
neighbor's dog, uh,

1033
00:57:43,692 --> 00:57:47,127
just like literally dropped
dead on Chris' porch.

1034
00:57:47,128 --> 00:57:48,695
I don't know, it was like, uh,

1035
00:57:48,696 --> 00:57:51,933
like a heart attack or
something, and I...

1036
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:53,067
No, it's fine.

1037
00:57:53,068 --> 00:57:54,935
Don't, don't be sad, okay?

1038
00:57:54,936 --> 00:57:56,770
The dog was ugly as shit.

1039
00:57:56,771 --> 00:58:00,140
I just, um, I can't,
I can't decide whether

1040
00:58:00,141 --> 00:58:02,141
I should tell
the owner or just bu...

1041
00:58:02,142 --> 00:58:04,275
I don't know, I don't
know what to do.

1042
00:58:33,275 --> 00:58:35,676
Yes?

1043
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:39,147
Oh, hi.
Um, I'm Michael.

1044
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:42,817
I needed to, uh, talk
to you about your dog.

1045
00:58:42,818 --> 00:58:46,154
She's all right, I hope.

1046
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:47,187
Uh, no.

1047
00:58:47,188 --> 00:58:48,190
Actually, I'm sorry.

1048
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:52,292
Um, I found her by the road.

1049
00:58:52,293 --> 00:58:55,197
It looked like some
coyotes had gotten to her.

1050
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:58,198
Impossible.

1051
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:00,972
Poor Sophie.

1052
00:59:03,972 --> 00:59:06,375
Would you like to
sit for a moment?

1053
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,743
I just made some tea.

1054
00:59:08,744 --> 00:59:13,314
I think it's just a sprain.

1055
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:15,850
But, yeah, I mean, um,

1056
00:59:15,851 --> 00:59:17,119
yeah, I could go for some tea.

1057
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,315
Thank you.

1058
00:59:46,315 --> 00:59:49,250
I, uh, I never
caught your name.

1059
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:51,319
Byron.

1060
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,128
I'm Michael.

1061
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:00,008
You are from the city?

1062
01:00:00,862 --> 01:00:02,764
Yeah, yeah, I'm just out here

1063
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:06,234
taking care of my friend.

1064
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:08,289
Thank you.

1065
01:00:28,289 --> 01:00:29,756
Do you mind?

1066
01:00:29,757 --> 01:00:32,697
Oh, no, go right ahead.

1067
01:00:35,697 --> 01:00:37,064
Are you French?

1068
01:00:37,065 --> 01:00:40,067
Yeah.

1069
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:42,271
How long have you
been out here?

1070
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:44,007
Almost thirty years,

1071
01:00:45,007 --> 01:00:47,841
believe it or not.

1072
01:00:47,842 --> 01:00:50,179
I mean, how'd you, uh,
how did you end up here?

1073
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:53,247
If you don't mind me asking.

1074
01:00:53,248 --> 01:00:57,852
I was studying archeology
at the Sorbonne, and, uh,

1075
01:00:57,853 --> 01:01:01,988
I receive a grant
to study native art.

1076
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:06,194
And you just never went back?

1077
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:07,160
I study man,

1078
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:11,471
but I prefer not
to be with him.

1079
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:17,205
You are fine.

1080
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:20,284
I can run faster than
you at the moment.

1081
01:01:29,284 --> 01:01:31,384
So, you, uh,

1082
01:01:31,385 --> 01:01:33,422
you have a lot of time
to yourself here.

1083
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:37,394
It is a unusual story.

1084
01:01:40,394 --> 01:01:44,371
I've, uh, I've got some time.

1085
01:01:50,371 --> 01:01:53,009
Two students came here with me.

1086
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:56,378
They said they were studying
some related topics

1087
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:00,214
in archeology and physics.

1088
01:02:00,215 --> 01:02:04,023
Something about new
carbon dating methods.

1089
01:02:08,023 --> 01:02:09,925
They were very excited
when they first arrived

1090
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,326
but then the arguing began.

1091
01:02:12,327 --> 01:02:15,130
One would accuse the other
of hiding research

1092
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:18,265
or stealing findings.

1093
01:02:18,266 --> 01:02:21,438
A lot of screaming
and slammed doors.

1094
01:02:23,438 --> 01:02:25,305
Oh, no, I'm good.

1095
01:02:25,306 --> 01:02:28,442
Actually, I haven't done
that since college.

1096
01:02:28,443 --> 01:02:29,809
Actually, what, what is that?

1097
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:31,091
I've never seen
it red like that.

1098
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:33,981
I cannot remember
the exact name,

1099
01:02:33,982 --> 01:02:38,084
but the seeds I brought
from South America

1100
01:02:38,085 --> 01:02:41,221
many years ago.

1101
01:02:41,222 --> 01:02:42,490
It grows nicely on the hillside

1102
01:02:42,491 --> 01:02:45,264
this time of year.

1103
01:02:49,264 --> 01:02:50,230
What?

1104
01:02:50,231 --> 01:02:53,234
What was I saying?

1105
01:02:53,235 --> 01:02:55,570
You were telling me
about the students.

1106
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:57,904
Yes.

1107
01:02:57,905 --> 01:03:02,042
I do not know what they
were actually studying

1108
01:03:02,043 --> 01:03:05,446
but the yelling was constant,

1109
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:10,317
and one day the noise
went into the woods

1110
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:12,453
and they never returned.

1111
01:03:12,454 --> 01:03:14,756
- Did they go back to France?
- They left their passports.

1112
01:03:14,956 --> 01:03:18,426
I tried to find them
through university

1113
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:20,427
but there was no
record of them.

1114
01:03:20,428 --> 01:03:23,530
And you don't know what
they were researching?

1115
01:03:23,531 --> 01:03:25,534
I found some papers
in the trash,

1116
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:29,303
some esoteric writings
on manipulating

1117
01:03:29,304 --> 01:03:33,406
light and sound waves.

1118
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:37,178
I think they were
searching for monsters

1119
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:39,951
and they found each other.

1120
01:03:42,951 --> 01:03:46,087
Monsters?

1121
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,154
The people come here, Michael,

1122
01:03:48,155 --> 01:03:51,225
to look for aliens,

1123
01:03:51,226 --> 01:03:55,529
ghosts, and cults,
and gateways to hell,

1124
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:58,499
and secret military bases

1125
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,104
looking into other dimensions.

1126
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:06,439
I think if there is something

1127
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,977
it is not none of these things,

1128
01:04:09,978 --> 01:04:12,546
or perhaps all of them.

1129
01:04:12,547 --> 01:04:14,682
I'm sorry, I'm not at
all following

1130
01:04:14,683 --> 01:04:16,651
what you're saying.

1131
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:19,021
How does an isolated
tribesman in Ecuador

1132
01:04:20,021 --> 01:04:23,256
know the difference
between an alien,

1133
01:04:23,257 --> 01:04:27,429
an angel, and a ghost?

1134
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:31,364
I have no idea.

1135
01:04:31,365 --> 01:04:32,566
He doesn't,

1136
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:37,203
but he tells a story

1137
01:04:37,204 --> 01:04:41,375
to make sense

1138
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:45,413
of the infinite.

1139
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:48,482
Sometimes when

1140
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:50,484
I stare up

1141
01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:54,488
and look into the infinite

1142
01:04:54,489 --> 01:04:57,329
I see film.

1143
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:01,328
A film?

1144
01:05:01,329 --> 01:05:06,433
A membrane there,
and behind it is another,

1145
01:05:06,434 --> 01:05:09,569
and another,

1146
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:12,007
and another.

1147
01:05:13,007 --> 01:05:17,645
Do you see?

1148
01:05:17,646 --> 01:05:21,482
No, I, uh... No, I don't.

1149
01:05:21,483 --> 01:05:23,651
I'm sorry.

1150
01:05:23,652 --> 01:05:27,321
Each one has a beginning,

1151
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:29,522
middle,

1152
01:05:29,523 --> 01:05:32,625
and end.

1153
01:05:32,626 --> 01:05:34,030
Beginning,

1154
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:36,529
middle,

1155
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:39,767
end.

1156
01:05:39,768 --> 01:05:44,138
Beginning,

1157
01:05:44,139 --> 01:05:46,445
middle...

1158
01:05:50,445 --> 01:05:52,446
end.

1159
01:05:52,447 --> 01:05:54,448
Thank you so much for the tea

1160
01:05:54,449 --> 01:05:55,616
and the aspirin.

1161
01:05:55,617 --> 01:05:57,618
I, uh, I should make my way

1162
01:05:57,619 --> 01:06:01,187
back home now.

1163
01:06:01,188 --> 01:06:03,624
Again, I'm sorry
about your dog.

1164
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:06,682
Aspirin?

1165
01:06:28,682 --> 01:06:30,350
Shit.

1166
01:06:30,351 --> 01:06:31,419
Shit!

1167
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:32,787
Fuck, Chris!

1168
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:34,055
What?

1169
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:35,323
What's happening? What?

1170
01:06:35,456 --> 01:06:37,457
Fuck.

1171
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:38,558
God.

1172
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:41,428
What's wrong with you?
Jesus, are you all right?

1173
01:06:41,429 --> 01:06:42,430
Fucking "A".

1174
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:45,066
Oh, no, dude, I'm fine, man.

1175
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:46,500
This is nothin'.

1176
01:06:46,501 --> 01:06:49,236
Oh, no big deal.

1177
01:06:49,237 --> 01:06:51,071
No, I was, uh...

1178
01:06:51,072 --> 01:06:53,273
I couldn't find an artery
with a coffee cup,

1179
01:06:53,274 --> 01:06:55,242
so I was trying
to pull a spring out

1180
01:06:55,243 --> 01:06:58,645
of the mattress here,
but this mattress

1181
01:06:58,646 --> 01:07:01,182
is like made by NASA
or something, man.

1182
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,549
It's like Teflon.

1183
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:03,517
Goddammit.

1184
01:07:03,518 --> 01:07:05,453
Could not get a spring out.

1185
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:06,353
God, it's just...

1186
01:07:06,354 --> 01:07:08,090
Just fell asleep,
I guess, after that.

1187
01:07:08,091 --> 01:07:11,091
It's tiresome.

1188
01:07:11,092 --> 01:07:12,660
Fucking "A", man.

1189
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:13,561
What's up with you?

1190
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:14,627
You scared me.

1191
01:07:14,628 --> 01:07:17,297
Why'd you run
in here like that?

1192
01:07:17,298 --> 01:07:18,098
Seriously.

1193
01:07:18,099 --> 01:07:19,299
I scared you?

1194
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,666
Yeah, you came in
guns blazing, man.

1195
01:07:20,667 --> 01:07:23,204
- I thought there was a fucking...
- It's a fucking scratch.

1196
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:25,672
War outside.

1197
01:07:25,673 --> 01:07:26,541
Yeah, dude, it's no big deal.

1198
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,776
Goddammit.

1199
01:07:28,777 --> 01:07:31,849
Woo.

1200
01:07:34,849 --> 01:07:37,750
See, man, no problem.

1201
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:40,421
Thank you, nurse.

1202
01:07:40,422 --> 01:07:41,289
You're welcome.

1203
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:44,530
There we go.

1204
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:49,797
What's up with your limp?

1205
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:53,667
Yeah, I, uh, I fell running.

1206
01:07:53,668 --> 01:07:56,637
Fuck, dude, I told ya, man,
mountain lions out there.

1207
01:07:56,638 --> 01:07:58,705
Homeless guy.

1208
01:07:58,706 --> 01:08:02,877
Homeless guy?

1209
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:05,913
Mike, you know what?

1210
01:08:05,914 --> 01:08:08,617
There's a lot of hobo
junkies in that cave

1211
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:10,783
I sent you to.

1212
01:08:10,784 --> 01:08:13,195
Don't go to that cave, dude.

1213
01:08:21,195 --> 01:08:26,233
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

1214
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:28,979
There really are a lot
of weird people out here.

1215
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:15,715
Chris.

1216
01:09:15,716 --> 01:09:16,884
Yeah?

1217
01:09:16,885 --> 01:09:20,321
Is this your knife?

1218
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,488
Hey, man, yeah it is.

1219
01:09:22,489 --> 01:09:24,858
I lost it a couple weeks ago.

1220
01:09:24,859 --> 01:09:26,526
Man, I could've
used it this week.

1221
01:09:26,527 --> 01:09:27,860
Where'd you find it?

1222
01:09:27,861 --> 01:09:29,797
Below this fucking
carving that appeared

1223
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:32,599
while we were asleep.

1224
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,902
Looks exactly like the story

1225
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:36,306
on the cave wall yesterday.

1226
01:09:39,306 --> 01:09:42,776
Mike, are you
feeling all right?

1227
01:09:42,777 --> 01:09:46,447
Yeah.

1228
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,948
Mike, are you sure?

1229
01:09:48,949 --> 01:09:51,483
Yeah, what's that got
to do with the carving?

1230
01:09:51,484 --> 01:09:53,719
I don't know, 'cause when you're out
here, your mind plays tricks on you.

1231
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,955
You know, the elevation,
the electrical

1232
01:09:55,956 --> 01:09:57,558
does weird things,
and there's satellites

1233
01:09:58,025 --> 01:09:59,025
that are always watching.

1234
01:09:59,027 --> 01:10:00,727
Will you stop talking
about the satellites?

1235
01:10:00,728 --> 01:10:02,729
I don't know how they work either,
Mike, but there are satellites,

1236
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:03,864
and they're always here
always watching.

1237
01:10:03,865 --> 01:10:09,303
Look, you are a suicidal
paranoid junkie, okay?

1238
01:10:09,304 --> 01:10:10,837
You're my friend,

1239
01:10:10,838 --> 01:10:12,571
but you're a crazy drug addict.

1240
01:10:12,572 --> 01:10:14,842
Fine, I'm just saying
there's satellites.

1241
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:16,977
Listen, okay?

1242
01:10:16,978 --> 01:10:17,712
You never listen.

1243
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:20,318
Will you just listen to me?

1244
01:10:23,318 --> 01:10:25,586
Look, I stopped by Sara's

1245
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:29,657
owner's place yesterday, okay?

1246
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:31,493
He knew the people who
owned the equipment

1247
01:10:31,494 --> 01:10:34,961
down in the shed.

1248
01:10:34,962 --> 01:10:36,765
They have been missing
for thirty years.

1249
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:39,933
Mike, you know I know
you're a good guy,

1250
01:10:39,934 --> 01:10:43,336
but I gotta tell ya
I've never seen

1251
01:10:43,337 --> 01:10:45,606
any of the stuff
you're talking about.

1252
01:10:45,607 --> 01:10:47,340
I get that, okay?

1253
01:10:47,341 --> 01:10:48,743
Will you just, will
you just hear me out

1254
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:51,612
so I can just try and
make sense of this?

1255
01:10:51,613 --> 01:10:53,447
All right.

1256
01:10:53,448 --> 01:10:56,916
All right, so people
come to the boonies

1257
01:10:56,917 --> 01:11:01,054
to like explore religion,

1258
01:11:01,055 --> 01:11:04,058
or to, uh, hallucinate,

1259
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:06,460
or to tell ghost stories,

1260
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:08,728
or, you know, find UFOs,

1261
01:11:08,729 --> 01:11:10,863
or Bigfoot, or whatever,

1262
01:11:10,864 --> 01:11:12,665
and we've been led
to some stories.

1263
01:11:12,666 --> 01:11:13,748
We've allegedly been led...

1264
01:11:14,002 --> 01:11:15,035
Listen, dude!

1265
01:11:15,036 --> 01:11:19,939
Look, assume that I am honest

1266
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:22,343
and sane, okay?

1267
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:26,813
We were presented with
several stories, all right?

1268
01:11:26,814 --> 01:11:30,384
And all of those stories

1269
01:11:30,385 --> 01:11:33,724
had an ending.

1270
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:37,491
What the fuck was that?

1271
01:11:37,492 --> 01:11:38,458
Mike, it's an old house.

1272
01:11:38,459 --> 01:11:39,627
It's gonna make
noise sometimes.

1273
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:42,895
It's not a big deal.

1274
01:11:42,896 --> 01:11:46,734
Look, I'll never really know what
actually happened this last week,

1275
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:50,603
but if I could like

1276
01:11:50,604 --> 01:11:55,408
give you closure, or whatever,

1277
01:11:55,409 --> 01:11:59,145
maybe it'll make
you feel better.

1278
01:11:59,146 --> 01:12:00,814
I mean, we're paid
through until sundown,

1279
01:12:00,815 --> 01:12:03,684
but, um, yeah,

1280
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:07,657
I mean at this point I
guess it is what it is.

1281
01:12:09,657 --> 01:12:11,911
Will you sit down?

1282
01:12:29,911 --> 01:12:33,417
I will never go to rehab.

1283
01:12:36,417 --> 01:12:39,685
Ever.

1284
01:12:39,686 --> 01:12:42,456
Please just let me kill myself

1285
01:12:42,457 --> 01:12:46,859
the way that I want
to kill myself.

1286
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:53,467
I appreciate all the stuff you're
doing for me, man, but as my friend,

1287
01:12:53,868 --> 01:12:56,974
you gotta just let me go.

1288
01:12:59,974 --> 01:13:02,713
All right.

1289
01:13:06,713 --> 01:13:08,054
All right.

1290
01:13:13,054 --> 01:13:15,188
Did you Photoshop that?

1291
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:16,757
Why the fuck would you do that?

1292
01:13:16,758 --> 01:13:18,524
No, I didn't.

1293
01:13:18,525 --> 01:13:21,899
Just give me
the fucking key, please.

1294
01:13:25,899 --> 01:13:28,774
Fuck this, I'm going home.

1295
01:13:32,774 --> 01:13:33,908
You gotta be fucking
kidding me, Mike.

1296
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,041
Really?

1297
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:39,078
Chris, the slide machine just
turned on and operated by itself.

1298
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:40,680
It's electrical, Mike.

1299
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:43,684
I guarantee you the wiring in this
house is not up to code, man.

1300
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:47,821
There's pictures of us in the
fucking thing that we didn't take.

1301
01:13:47,822 --> 01:13:50,924
I don't know what the fuck
you do when you leave here.

1302
01:13:50,925 --> 01:13:52,525
Look, ever since I opened up

1303
01:13:52,526 --> 01:13:53,960
that clip of you
something's been...

1304
01:13:53,961 --> 01:13:55,995
Oh, now you're gonna tell
you didn't open that?

1305
01:13:55,996 --> 01:13:59,066
What would convince you that
I'm not lying or crazy?

1306
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,200
I don't know.

1307
01:14:00,201 --> 01:14:03,269
So, we're at an impasse?

1308
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:05,943
I guess so.

1309
01:14:08,943 --> 01:14:09,909
Did you see that?

1310
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:10,710
Did you see that?

1311
01:14:10,711 --> 01:14:12,246
See what? See what?

1312
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:14,256
That. That.

1313
01:14:22,256 --> 01:14:25,042
Fuck, no, no!

1314
01:14:41,042 --> 01:14:42,522
We need to leave before
they get here.

1315
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:45,946
- Mike, I don't understand.
- Look, man, I'm sorry.

1316
01:14:45,947 --> 01:14:47,147
I don't...

1317
01:14:47,148 --> 01:14:49,550
Could we go, please?

1318
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:52,586
Wait, hold on. Let's just, uh,

1319
01:14:52,587 --> 01:14:54,721
let's just think
about this, okay?

1320
01:14:54,722 --> 01:14:58,125
We, uh, we know it doesn't

1321
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:01,295
want me to go home,

1322
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:04,636
but we know we can't stay here.

1323
01:15:08,636 --> 01:15:12,839
Mike, we gotta... Please, let's go.
What's going on, Mike?

1324
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,541
Just calm down, okay?
We'll be all right.

1325
01:15:14,542 --> 01:15:16,977
Mike, no.

1326
01:15:16,978 --> 01:15:18,611
- Mike, what's happening?
- I don't know.

1327
01:15:18,612 --> 01:15:20,886
Mike, if you had
to guess what...

1328
01:15:24,886 --> 01:15:28,354
Okay, say, uh...

1329
01:15:28,355 --> 01:15:32,027
Say, uh, say we hit
some film, okay,

1330
01:15:33,027 --> 01:15:36,362
and I'm, I'm looking
at you, all right?

1331
01:15:36,363 --> 01:15:38,733
We take that film,
we get it developed,

1332
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:41,100
and then when I'm
looking at you,

1333
01:15:41,101 --> 01:15:43,135
appears on the photo.

1334
01:15:43,136 --> 01:15:45,939
It's basically it's like,
like using your mind

1335
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:48,742
to send whatever you're seeing,

1336
01:15:48,743 --> 01:15:51,978
or thinking, or imagining,
to a, to a film,

1337
01:15:51,979 --> 01:15:55,118
or a tape, or something.

1338
01:15:57,118 --> 01:16:00,786
We were both in that.

1339
01:16:00,787 --> 01:16:02,733
I know.

1340
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:16,202
What does it want, Mike?

1341
01:16:16,203 --> 01:16:17,203
I don't know.

1342
01:16:17,204 --> 01:16:20,377
Afucking, a theory, man?

1343
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:26,779
I think it wants a story.

1344
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,114
That's it?

1345
01:16:28,115 --> 01:16:31,084
That's all?

1346
01:16:31,085 --> 01:16:34,692
I think it wants
a story with an ending.

1347
01:16:37,692 --> 01:16:39,425
Mike, wait, wait, wait.

1348
01:16:39,426 --> 01:16:41,428
Where're we going?

1349
01:16:41,429 --> 01:16:45,233
Okay, on the webcam it was daylight
when they were in the cabin, right?

1350
01:16:45,234 --> 01:16:46,233
Uh-huh.

1351
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:48,933
Okay, so we'll take my truck,
we'll drive somewhere nearby,

1352
01:16:48,934 --> 01:16:50,068
and we'll come back later
tonight after they're gone.

1353
01:16:50,069 --> 01:16:50,769
Then what?

1354
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:54,107
Uh, we'll shake hands,
and I'll go home.

1355
01:16:54,108 --> 01:16:55,376
I mean, that's what you wanted

1356
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:58,812
and it gives us an ending.

1357
01:16:58,813 --> 01:16:59,813
I found it.

1358
01:16:59,814 --> 01:17:01,715
- Found what?
- What I owe Billy.

1359
01:17:01,716 --> 01:17:03,282
- Hey, how the fuck did you get...
- I don't know, man!

1360
01:17:03,283 --> 01:17:05,250
I was fucking high, and I tried to
drive this stupid fucking truck.

1361
01:17:05,251 --> 01:17:06,285
Just get it the fuck
out of here.

1362
01:17:06,286 --> 01:17:08,055
Okay, I will.
Calm down, all right, dude?

1363
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:08,756
Jesus.

1364
01:17:08,923 --> 01:17:10,992
Please put it in
the cabin or something.

1365
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:12,425
Shit.

1366
01:17:12,426 --> 01:17:14,161
Just give it...

1367
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:15,862
I'm going in the house.

1368
01:17:15,863 --> 01:17:17,198
Here give me... Up
the fucking hill.

1369
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,171
Fuck me.

1370
01:17:24,171 --> 01:17:25,971
Fuck.

1371
01:17:25,972 --> 01:17:29,209
Fuck.

1372
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:31,951
Oh.

1373
01:17:36,951 --> 01:17:39,296
Don't, don't play that.

1374
01:17:49,296 --> 01:17:51,831
Who is that?

1375
01:17:51,832 --> 01:17:56,435
It's Charles' friends.
I'll go talk to 'em.

1376
01:17:56,436 --> 01:17:58,470
Hey, I'm sorry we're
a little late,

1377
01:17:58,471 --> 01:17:59,740
but we were just leaving.

1378
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:01,179
Wait!

1379
01:18:05,179 --> 01:18:06,345
No, please.

1380
01:18:06,346 --> 01:18:07,447
Please.

1381
01:18:07,448 --> 01:18:11,584
Please! No, wait!

1382
01:18:12,185 --> 01:18:14,292
I'm a fath...

1383
01:18:18,292 --> 01:18:20,099
Burn it.

1384
01:18:25,099 --> 01:18:27,067
It's a horrible idea.

1385
01:18:27,068 --> 01:18:29,102
It's a horrible idea.

1386
01:18:29,103 --> 01:18:31,876
It's a horrible idea.

1387
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:38,077
All right.

1388
01:18:38,078 --> 01:18:39,438
We know I can't go home,

1389
01:18:40,014 --> 01:18:42,283
but we can't go to
the cabin any time

1390
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:44,550
today or tonight.

1391
01:18:44,551 --> 01:18:46,051
Fuck, man.

1392
01:18:46,052 --> 01:18:47,786
Can you just fucking
call someone?

1393
01:18:47,787 --> 01:18:50,321
Call the fucking,
call the fucking FBI.

1394
01:18:50,322 --> 01:18:51,958
Call the fucking FBI
or something

1395
01:18:51,959 --> 01:18:56,328
and let's fucking go!

1396
01:18:56,329 --> 01:18:59,398
I can't take this home.

1397
01:18:59,399 --> 01:19:01,101
No, we gotta get through
this thing here, okay?

1398
01:19:01,102 --> 01:19:03,536
We, uh, we don't even know

1399
01:19:03,537 --> 01:19:06,212
if it can do anything to us.

1400
01:19:11,212 --> 01:19:13,046
I'll go. I'll go first.

1401
01:19:13,047 --> 01:19:15,948
No, we'll both go.

1402
01:19:15,949 --> 01:19:16,983
Fuck, man.

1403
01:19:16,984 --> 01:19:18,185
Do you think there's bats?

1404
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:20,153
Probably.

1405
01:19:20,154 --> 01:19:22,188
Do you remember Danny Kaiser?

1406
01:19:22,189 --> 01:19:23,291
With the messed up teeth?

1407
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:25,358
Yeah.

1408
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:27,393
He was squatting at
a barn up the street.

1409
01:19:27,394 --> 01:19:29,961
Like a couple months
ago he got rabies.

1410
01:19:29,962 --> 01:19:30,698
Did he die?

1411
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:33,066
He wishes he was
dead because he

1412
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:34,465
was just foaming at the
mouth when they got him.

1413
01:19:34,466 --> 01:19:37,370
He was just walking in
circles, and was chasing kids.

1414
01:19:37,371 --> 01:19:41,407
He can only say a few words now,
and he just drools all the time.

1415
01:19:41,408 --> 01:19:44,143
Look, Mike, I know your leg's hurt, but
if there's something down there, man,

1416
01:19:44,144 --> 01:19:45,910
you gotta just,
please, just run

1417
01:19:45,911 --> 01:19:47,180
like it doesn't hurt, okay?

1418
01:19:47,181 --> 01:19:48,281
Please?

1419
01:19:48,282 --> 01:19:49,916
Okay.

1420
01:19:49,917 --> 01:19:51,319
Do you remember Derrick Jones?

1421
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,087
Oh, fuck. All right, I'll go.

1422
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:54,120
Jesus.

1423
01:19:54,121 --> 01:19:55,378
Thanks, man.

1424
01:20:18,378 --> 01:20:20,613
What if we just didn't open it?

1425
01:20:20,614 --> 01:20:22,282
We have to open it.

1426
01:20:22,283 --> 01:20:25,051
What if we just took it with us,
and then if we wanted to open it,

1427
01:20:25,052 --> 01:20:27,053
we would consider opening,
opening it then?

1428
01:20:27,054 --> 01:20:29,487
Look, I can't go home and
that last footage saved you

1429
01:20:29,488 --> 01:20:31,958
from getting beaten
to death or shot.

1430
01:20:31,959 --> 01:20:34,394
We don't know that, right?

1431
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:36,327
What if this thing's actually
trying to help us?

1432
01:20:36,328 --> 01:20:39,475
We don't even know if this stuff
is really gonna happen or not.

1433
01:20:48,475 --> 01:20:50,510
That car was a gift.

1434
01:20:50,511 --> 01:20:51,678
Goddammit.

1435
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,185
All right, man, open it.

1436
01:20:59,185 --> 01:21:01,987
Ow, fuck.

1437
01:21:01,988 --> 01:21:03,924
It's us.

1438
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,224
And?

1439
01:21:05,225 --> 01:21:08,528
Uh, we're outside
and the cabin's

1440
01:21:08,529 --> 01:21:12,532
in the background.

1441
01:21:12,533 --> 01:21:14,466
Okay, what else?

1442
01:21:14,467 --> 01:21:16,671
Okay, we're still
outside but it's night,

1443
01:21:16,672 --> 01:21:18,571
and we're lit by a fire.

1444
01:21:18,572 --> 01:21:19,605
A fire?

1445
01:21:19,606 --> 01:21:21,206
Yeah.

1446
01:21:21,207 --> 01:21:22,342
Do we look all right?

1447
01:21:22,343 --> 01:21:24,411
I, I don't know, I mean,

1448
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:26,146
yeah, I think,
I think we look okay.

1449
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:27,380
And are we upset?

1450
01:21:27,381 --> 01:21:28,514
I don't know.

1451
01:21:28,515 --> 01:21:30,483
It's difficult to see.

1452
01:21:30,484 --> 01:21:33,420
I don't know.

1453
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:36,156
Do you think all that stuff
down there is of us?

1454
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:37,690
Why are you asking me?
Fuck, really?

1455
01:21:37,691 --> 01:21:39,326
You don't wanna talk about it?
Okay.

1456
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:41,528
Yes, I think it's all us.

1457
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:43,564
Do you think that's all of it?

1458
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,165
No.

1459
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:47,099
I think we could be on any

1460
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,469
recording device anywhere.

1461
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:52,505
We could be on a fucking
hard drive in China.

1462
01:21:52,506 --> 01:21:54,608
They should be at
the cabin by now.

1463
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:58,144
Do you think they
found the bag?

1464
01:21:58,145 --> 01:22:00,213
I left it inside
for them to find.

1465
01:22:00,214 --> 01:22:00,715
Fuck.

1466
01:22:00,914 --> 01:22:02,957
They're smoking that bag, man.
They're fucking smoking that bag.

1467
01:22:02,983 --> 01:22:04,183
Maybe they took the
trees to the road.

1468
01:22:04,184 --> 01:22:07,320
No, man, they're getting fucked up,
and they're fucking waiting for us

1469
01:22:07,321 --> 01:22:10,523
to fuck us up.

1470
01:22:10,524 --> 01:22:14,126
I'm gonna go to that
place in the film.

1471
01:22:14,127 --> 01:22:15,496
The rocks in front
of the cabin.

1472
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:17,528
Why would... That's
fucking nighttime, man.

1473
01:22:17,529 --> 01:22:19,199
It's like fucking noon right now.
Are you crazy?

1474
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,500
I'll be fine, okay?

1475
01:22:20,501 --> 01:22:22,735
Look, I'm gonna sneak
around the back,

1476
01:22:22,736 --> 01:22:24,469
I'll be far enough away,
and plus they're probably

1477
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:25,737
so fucked up they won't
even know I'm there.

1478
01:22:25,738 --> 01:22:27,774
Why would you fucking do that?

1479
01:22:27,775 --> 01:22:30,609
Because I think if we
can get to the end

1480
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:34,179
of this reel of film,
we'll be fine.

1481
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:35,714
You don't fucking know that.

1482
01:22:35,715 --> 01:22:37,648
No, I don't, but do you
have a better plan?

1483
01:22:37,649 --> 01:22:39,183
Yeah, man, let's fucking leave.

1484
01:22:39,184 --> 01:22:40,755
Chris, I am not taking this

1485
01:22:40,756 --> 01:22:44,590
home to my wife.

1486
01:22:44,591 --> 01:22:48,127
Fuck!

1487
01:22:48,128 --> 01:22:49,630
All right, man,
fuck it I'll go.

1488
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:50,397
Let's go.

1489
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:52,498
You can leave. No, fuck you,
don't make me feel guilty.

1490
01:22:52,499 --> 01:22:55,336
I'll fucking go, I said
I'll go, let's go.

1491
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:59,538
All right.

1492
01:22:59,539 --> 01:23:01,074
Lighter, lighter,
lighter, pants on fire.

1493
01:23:01,075 --> 01:23:03,216
Do it, do it, do it, do it.

1494
01:23:09,216 --> 01:23:12,285
So, what's it like, uh,

1495
01:23:12,286 --> 01:23:15,054
what's it like being married?

1496
01:23:15,055 --> 01:23:18,058
It's good, you know,
I mean it's, uh,

1497
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:20,626
it's hard, but, uh,

1498
01:23:20,627 --> 01:23:23,664
yeah, I like it.

1499
01:23:24,664 --> 01:23:28,768
What's it like being single?

1500
01:23:28,769 --> 01:23:31,604
Well, getting high all
the time pretty much

1501
01:23:31,605 --> 01:23:34,674
covers that base.

1502
01:23:34,675 --> 01:23:36,444
You don't have like
a, like a junkie

1503
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:38,411
girlfriend or something?

1504
01:23:38,412 --> 01:23:40,212
No.

1505
01:23:40,213 --> 01:23:43,349
No, I don't.

1506
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:48,288
Actually, I did go into the
city like a couple months ago,

1507
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:52,559
and I picked
up a little "hmm-hmm."

1508
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,261
What's that? What's "hmm-hmm"?

1509
01:23:55,262 --> 01:23:56,696
Yeah, what's that?

1510
01:23:56,697 --> 01:23:59,199
You know, man, like
on the back of the...

1511
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:03,670
Like the reader those,
those like little box ads.

1512
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:05,170
I don't know.

1513
01:24:05,171 --> 01:24:06,573
A fucking hooker, Mike.

1514
01:24:06,574 --> 01:24:08,140
Goddamn.

1515
01:24:08,141 --> 01:24:11,612
Yeah, the whole thing just
was like ridiculous, man.

1516
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:15,180
Um, we just, basically
just were gacking rails

1517
01:24:15,181 --> 01:24:18,451
all night long, and, uh,

1518
01:24:18,452 --> 01:24:21,754
I just talked her ear
off for like six hours,

1519
01:24:21,755 --> 01:24:24,256
and then by the end of it, um,

1520
01:24:24,257 --> 01:24:27,727
she just like took off
like all freaked out.

1521
01:24:27,728 --> 01:24:29,260
We never even took our
clothes off or nothing.

1522
01:24:29,261 --> 01:24:31,696
We just talked,
and then I scared her.

1523
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:33,667
That was pretty much my
last sexual experience.

1524
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:34,901
That sounds awful.

1525
01:24:34,902 --> 01:24:37,603
It was horrible.

1526
01:24:37,604 --> 01:24:40,239
Yeah.

1527
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:43,643
Was it true about
the, uh, dad thing?

1528
01:24:43,644 --> 01:24:45,178
What dad thing?

1529
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:47,546
On the fucking CD.

1530
01:24:47,547 --> 01:24:49,715
Yeah.

1531
01:24:49,716 --> 01:24:52,585
Yeah, I'm gonna be a dad.

1532
01:24:52,586 --> 01:24:53,553
Fuck, man.

1533
01:24:53,554 --> 01:24:55,354
Are you sketched out?

1534
01:24:55,355 --> 01:24:56,489
I'm okay with it.

1535
01:24:56,490 --> 01:24:58,524
When's it going down?

1536
01:24:58,525 --> 01:24:59,459
Seven months.

1537
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:01,728
Seven months?

1538
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:03,263
Boy or girl?

1539
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:05,263
Well, it's a little
early to tell.

1540
01:25:05,264 --> 01:25:07,366
Well, I'm not
a pediatrician, Mike.

1541
01:25:07,367 --> 01:25:09,434
I don't know.
Obstetrician.

1542
01:25:09,435 --> 01:25:11,170
Whatever, man.

1543
01:25:11,171 --> 01:25:14,607
Um, yeah, let's just
hope it's a boy, right?

1544
01:25:14,608 --> 01:25:19,545
Better worrying about one wiener
than like every wiener in the world.

1545
01:25:19,546 --> 01:25:20,881
Could I borrow
one of your guns?

1546
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:24,384
Sure, dude.

1547
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:25,953
You would make a good uncle.

1548
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:28,220
Whatever.

1549
01:25:28,221 --> 01:25:29,388
That's bull, that's
bullshit, man.

1550
01:25:29,389 --> 01:25:31,455
Give yourself
a little credit, man.

1551
01:25:31,456 --> 01:25:32,758
Seriously, you're like,

1552
01:25:32,759 --> 01:25:34,328
you're one of the most loyal,

1553
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:37,397
protective, and smartest
people I know.

1554
01:25:37,398 --> 01:25:40,199
You know, and you don't
wave it in people's faces

1555
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,868
and make them feel
stupid about it.

1556
01:25:41,869 --> 01:25:44,437
Come on, that's
a bunch of malarkey,

1557
01:25:44,438 --> 01:25:45,672
but thanks, though.

1558
01:25:45,673 --> 01:25:47,372
I'm serious.

1559
01:25:47,373 --> 01:25:48,906
Okay, why do you think,

1560
01:25:48,907 --> 01:25:51,478
why do you think you've
lasted as long as you have

1561
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:53,580
like you have?

1562
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:57,649
It's because the dirt bags you hang out
with actually like being around you.

1563
01:25:57,650 --> 01:26:00,687
You know, I think it
makes them feel better

1564
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:02,890
about their dark souls
to have someone

1565
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:04,724
like you around.

1566
01:26:04,725 --> 01:26:06,793
I appreciate it, man,
but I'm a piece of shit.

1567
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:08,428
You know it.

1568
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:09,963
You know.
No, you're not.

1569
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:13,832
Well, well, I mean even
though you completely

1570
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:17,371
abandoned your pregnant wife
to save a piece of shit

1571
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:20,340
like myself, I, uh,

1572
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:21,708
I think you're gonna
be a good dad.

1573
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:23,242
Thanks.

1574
01:26:23,243 --> 01:26:24,742
Yeah, I mean, I don't
know really much about it,

1575
01:26:24,743 --> 01:26:26,611
but I would imagine
being forgiving

1576
01:26:26,612 --> 01:26:27,745
has something to do
with being a good dad,

1577
01:26:27,746 --> 01:26:29,348
and, uh, you and I have
lasted this long,

1578
01:26:30,016 --> 01:26:31,719
so that shows that you're one

1579
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:34,757
forgiving motherfucker.

1580
01:26:37,757 --> 01:26:39,424
There's something
I should tell you.

1581
01:26:39,425 --> 01:26:40,828
It's cool, man, don't.

1582
01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:41,728
You...

1583
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:43,697
You're my buddy, that's
all that matters.

1584
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:46,265
No.

1585
01:26:46,266 --> 01:26:48,834
Look, I'm... I'm
trying to tell you...

1586
01:26:48,835 --> 01:26:49,802
Don't do it, man.

1587
01:26:49,803 --> 01:26:51,703
No, you were right, okay?

1588
01:26:51,704 --> 01:26:55,340
You know, I felt guilty
and I missed my best friend,

1589
01:26:55,341 --> 01:26:58,711
but I had, I had no
right to intrude

1590
01:26:58,712 --> 01:26:59,912
on your life like this, man.

1591
01:26:59,913 --> 01:27:01,680
I just didn't.

1592
01:27:01,681 --> 01:27:03,348
Dude, whatever, man.
Don't even sweat it.

1593
01:27:03,349 --> 01:27:06,519
I don't care.
We're cool.

1594
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:07,921
I know, it's just
like, you know,

1595
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:11,357
with the baby coming like
I felt like this was

1596
01:27:11,358 --> 01:27:14,827
my last chance to do
something to feel better

1597
01:27:14,828 --> 01:27:18,898
about myself, and I'm
just fucking sorry, man.

1598
01:27:18,899 --> 01:27:19,865
It is what it is, Mike.

1599
01:27:19,866 --> 01:27:21,767
I don't, I don't give a shit.

1600
01:27:21,768 --> 01:27:23,701
I mean, I'm sorry that I can't

1601
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:25,305
be this imaginary guy that you

1602
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:29,041
think is me, you know?

1603
01:27:29,042 --> 01:27:33,578
You're still my buddy.

1604
01:27:33,579 --> 01:27:36,782
Shit.

1605
01:27:36,783 --> 01:27:39,885
Ha-ha-ha!

1606
01:27:39,886 --> 01:27:41,994
That was cool.

1607
01:27:47,994 --> 01:27:52,864
Fuck, man!

1608
01:27:52,865 --> 01:27:53,933
Holy shit.

1609
01:27:53,934 --> 01:27:54,834
Fuck me.

1610
01:27:54,835 --> 01:27:56,868
Holy fuck.

1611
01:27:56,869 --> 01:27:58,970
Oh, my God.

1612
01:27:58,971 --> 01:28:00,488
Burn it.

1613
01:28:15,488 --> 01:28:17,850
Oh, my fucking God.

1614
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:47,754
That's my bullets.

1615
01:28:47,755 --> 01:28:50,926
Is that it? Is that all of 'em?

1616
01:28:53,926 --> 01:28:56,862
Chris?

1617
01:28:56,863 --> 01:28:59,965
Chris.

1618
01:28:59,966 --> 01:29:00,866
Oh, fuck.

1619
01:29:01,001 --> 01:29:03,038
Oh, fuck!

1620
01:29:06,038 --> 01:29:06,938
No, Mike!

1621
01:29:06,939 --> 01:29:07,779
It's gonna burn, man.

1622
01:29:08,007 --> 01:29:10,948
I need a fucking
hit, let me go!

1623
01:29:14,948 --> 01:29:17,069
Fuck!

1624
01:29:36,069 --> 01:29:38,202
I don't wanna
fucking die, Mike.

1625
01:29:38,203 --> 01:29:40,039
I can't control it, man,
I really fucking can't.

1626
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,179
I need help.

1627
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:47,118
Can I take you to rehab?

1628
01:29:51,118 --> 01:29:52,998
Yeah.
It has to be now, man.

1629
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,755
You have to fucking
take me right now.

1630
01:29:55,756 --> 01:29:57,465
Okay.

1631
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:06,505
Oh, shit.

1632
01:30:11,505 --> 01:30:14,041
Hey, we gave that thing
a story with a happy ending.

1633
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:16,917
Fuck you.

1634
01:30:23,917 --> 01:30:26,117
Oh, God.

1635
01:30:26,118 --> 01:30:29,121
I'm sorry.

1636
01:30:29,122 --> 01:30:33,693
Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.

1637
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:35,695
I'm sorry.

1638
01:30:42,735 --> 01:30:45,171
Can we try it another way?
