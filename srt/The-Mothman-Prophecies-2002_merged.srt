1
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,581
Jesus!

2
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,669
Are you still there?

3
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,129
No, I'm back.

4
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,090
I'm not sure I got the spelling.

5
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:34,052
It is a "Y" Okay, great.
Yes, thank you. Bye.

6
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,524
Honey, you there?
Pick up, pick up.

7
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:51,653
You're not there. Okay.
Look, it's a little after 6:00.

8
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,489
I'll catch a ride
and see you out there. Bye.

9
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,787
- Jack.
- Yeah?

10
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:05,250
The Balkans peace council is "comprised"
or "composed" of ten members?

11
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,793
Twelve members.

12
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,795
Oh, right. Thanks.

13
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,715
Composed.

14
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,218
What?

15
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,890
A three-block area
has been evacuated.

16
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,935
You might wanna avoid that route
coming home from work.

17
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,517
- What do you think, Cy?
- This'll make them sweat. It's good.

18
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,228
- I'll lead with it.
- Great. I'll see you Monday.

19
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,105
What?

20
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,440
- I gotta go.
- Come on, John.

21
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:15,445
It'll look bad, my star reporter
not showing up at the Christmas party.

22
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,409
I can't.

23
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,411
Mary's waiting for me.

24
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:20,511
It's a big house, isn't it?
It's a steal at this price.

25
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,971
That's if you want it.

26
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,474
But we're gonna have to
make an offer today.

27
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,435
The owner's highly motivated.

28
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,063
Think it over.
I'll make some calls.

29
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,357
Take a look around.

30
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,359
Okay.
Thank you, Brian.

31
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,902
Thank you very much.

32
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,159
It's okay.
We're just gonna look.

33
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,832
My God.

34
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,547
Here you are.

35
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,050
We were just making sure
there was adequate closet space.

36
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,719
Good. Good.

37
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,346
Well, this house is yours
if you want it...

38
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,932
but you have to
decide right now.

39
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,517
We'll take it.

40
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,061
Really? Oh, my God!

41
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,684
You know what I kept thinking
when we were looking at that house?

42
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,687
That we should get
a mattress for that closet.

43
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,988
I kept thinking that
it felt like a dream come true.

44
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,248
Come here.

45
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,590
- How fast can you drive this thing?
- Really fast.

46
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:04,758
Let's see.

47
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,927
Okay.

48
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,273
- We bought a really, really...
- Excuse me. We bought a house.

49
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
We bought a big house.

50
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,056
Mary.

51
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,982
Mary, are you all right?
Mary, talk to me.

52
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,442
Are you okay?

53
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,281
Can you hear me?
Jesus Christ!

54
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,744
Hold on, darling.

55
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,664
911, there's been an accident.

56
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,166
Yes.

57
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,733
Nothing.

58
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You okay?
Yeah.

59
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,498
All right.
It's all right.

60
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,630
It's all right.
It's just me.

61
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,680
You didn't see it, did you?

62
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,559
See what?

63
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,273
What did you see?

64
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,654
I didn't see anything.

65
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,831
There's something wrong with me.

66
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,218
It's called a glioblastoma.

67
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,763
It's a temporal lobe tumor.

68
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,308
According to the doctor,
it's extremely rare.

69
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,435
One in...

70
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,521
600,000 gets this thing.

71
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,482
Did they say it was
a result of the accident?

72
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,110
No, it turns out...

73
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,112
that it's been there a while.

74
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,617
There's nothing else they can do?

75
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,413
They did the surgery, and they
couldn't get it all out, so they'll...

76
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,834
keep her on the chemo...

77
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,378
as long as her strength holds out.

78
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,550
That's working.
I think she's looking better now.

79
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,511
Good.

80
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,929
That's good.

81
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,433
Two weeks ago...

82
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,435
we were house hunting.

83
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,403
One day you're just
driving along in your car...

84
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,780
and the universe...

85
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,949
just points at you and says...

86
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:43,078
"Ah, there you are,
a happy couple.

87
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,581
I've been looking for you.

88
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,834
I've been looking for you".

89
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,089
I'm sorry.

90
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,842
For what?

91
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,848
For all of this.

92
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,396
I feel like
I ruined everything.

93
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,534
You didn't ruin anything.

94
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,537
Not a damn thing.

95
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,709
I want you to be happy.

96
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,450
You didn't see it, did you?

97
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,506
Yes.

98
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,802
Yeah?

99
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,095
She knew.

100
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,600
What?

101
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,353
She was drawing angels.

102
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:29,883
It was the meanness
of the campaigns...

103
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:33,720
the almost complete lack
of candor and honesty...

104
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,722
that turned the voters off..

105
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:41,395
I think that these parties
are demonizing each other.

106
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:46,149
They're projecting our own
personal fears and anxieties...

107
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,151
onto the national stage.

108
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:52,865
People don't like it. People are
very, very unsatisfied at the moment.

109
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:56,910
It makes them complacent because they
don't see any possibility of change.

110
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:01,164
2004... Is there a dark horse candidate
out there for the Democrats?

111
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,584
Well, I'm hearing a lot
about Russ McCallum.

112
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,086
- Governor of Virginia.
- Yeah, he might do what Carter...

113
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,843
Hey, I told her to watch.

114
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,219
Who?

115
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,762
Peter's friend Gwen.

116
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,640
She'll be there tonight.

117
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:22,978
Oh, God. Look, I don't think I'm gonna
be able to make that one tonight.

118
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,564
Come on, you can't keep
blowing this thing off.

119
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,941
I'm not. I've got an interview
with the governor.

120
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,611
I gotta be in Richmond
at 8:00 in the morning.

121
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:36,533
I almost forgot.
McCallum's office called.

122
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:39,077
They bumped the meeting
till tomorrow night.

123
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,418
Eddie, look, I...

124
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:47,419
Look...

125
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,340
she's not Mary.

126
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,050
Not by a mile.

127
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,719
But you know what?

128
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,097
No one ever will be.

129
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,057
Hey, Ed.
I'm sorry about today.

130
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,728
I'm sure Gwen is very nice.

131
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,189
Maybe some other time.

132
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,316
It's about 1:00 in the morning.

133
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,236
I'm a little wired,
so I'm driving down to Richmond tonight.

134
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,071
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye.

135
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,084
Al I right, come on.

136
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:18,589
Hi. I'm sorry. I know it's really late,
but my car broke down just up the road.

137
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,216
I wondered if I could
use the phone.

138
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,718
Hello.

139
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:25,846
It's him.

140
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,310
I been waitin' for you.

141
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:34,980
You son of a bitch.
What are you doin'?

142
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,149
Get the door! Get the door!

143
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,611
Just stay right there.

144
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,823
Mister, I don't know who you...

145
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:45,824
Shut up!

146
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:48,869
Shut up.

147
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:53,790
Honey, Connie's here.

148
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,628
Well, hey, Gordon.
How you doin'?

149
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:02,049
Okay, why don't you just...

150
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,469
put down the gun and tell me
what's going on here.

151
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,554
Yeah.

152
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:17,564
He's come around three nights in a row.
This son of a bitch is stalking us.

153
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:22,236
- I'm John Klein. My car broke down...
- Let's let Gordon finish, Mr. Klein.

154
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:24,947
Two nights ago...

155
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,992
at 2:30 in the a.m.,
there's a bang on the door.

156
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:32,329
I open it up,
and here's this guy.

157
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,623
He says he wants to use the phone.

158
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:37,417
But there's something
creepy about him...

159
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:39,586
so I tell him to get lost.

160
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,381
Last night at 2:30 on the dot,
guess who's back.

161
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,383
You're sure it was Mr. Klein here?

162
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:47,010
I am absolutely positive
it's Mr. Klein.

163
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:50,597
- Crazy. This is...
- I am not crazy.

164
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:53,851
- I didn't say that you...
- So then what happened?

165
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:56,603
I warned him off my property.

166
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,605
I used the word "trespass",
and he still came back.

167
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:02,734
You're lucky I'm a Christian, because I
had the right to shoot you on my porch.

168
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,862
He'd have to been
inside the house, Gordon.

169
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,405
What?

170
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,906
Fine.

171
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:11,910
So tonight I figured the dumb fuck might
come back, and sure enough, there he is.

172
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:15,497
It wasn't me.

173
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:18,584
I don't know what's happening here.

174
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,502
Something's very wrong here.

175
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:25,007
I don't know these people.
I have never been here before.

176
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:27,301
I'm from DC. Look.

177
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,887
It's a wallet, okay? Wallet?

178
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:32,639
I'm from DC.

179
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:34,683
My name is John Klein.

180
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:43,609
Washington Post.

181
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,110
Yes.

182
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,783
Can I get out of this shower now?

183
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,751
You can wait for me outside,
Mr. Klein.

184
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:08,759
We'll run a check on him.
Anyone else comes by, forget the gun.

185
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,802
Just call me.

186
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:13,263
Just find out what he wants.

187
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:30,155
So, you didn't actually see the guy
before tonight?

188
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:31,657
No.

189
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,660
But I heard the knocking.

190
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,787
Three nights in a row.

191
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,125
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

192
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:50,717
I'm gonna give you a ride into town,
unless you wanna sleep in your car.

193
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:53,220
I can call for a tow
in the morning.

194
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:01,186
You're a long way from DC.

195
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:04,147
What are you doing here?

196
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:06,733
Driving through.

197
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:11,238
We're not on the way
to anyplace, Mr. Klein.

198
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:23,876
I recognize you.

199
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:27,921
DC Review.

200
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:33,135
- You watch that?
- We're not all bumpkins.

201
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,597
So I'm not under arrest?

202
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,266
You didn't steal anything.
You didn't hurt anybody.

203
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:41,685
No breaking and entering.

204
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,645
You've had trouble
with him before?

205
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,732
Gordy and Denise? No.

206
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,233
They're good people.

207
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,279
Things have just been
a little strange around here lately.

208
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:09,296
You still haven't told me what you're
doing here in the middle of the night.

209
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,924
I don't know.

210
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:19,723
Where am I?

211
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:43,705
Think you could show me
where we are on the map here?

212
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:46,291
We're right on the state line.

213
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,466
With Ohio.

214
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:22,327
- What time did you leave DC?
- 1:00 in the morning.

215
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:25,914
If I was doing 80 the whole way, it
would've taken me six hours to get here.

216
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:29,376
- There's gotta be a logical explanation.
- I don't know.

217
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:33,964
By the way, don't worry about your pal
the governor. I'll take care of it.

218
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:35,591
Yeah. Okay.

219
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,092
Thanks, Eddie.

220
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:39,845
- So?
- It's running fine, Mr. Klein.

221
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:42,472
- Can't find a thing wrong with her.
- Really?

222
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:45,225
Strange.

223
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:49,730
- All right, what do I owe you?
- Nothin'.

224
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:53,692
I said I can't find
anything wrong with her.

225
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:32,689
Mr. Smallwood.

226
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:38,237
Mr. Smallwood...

227
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:46,119
I just wanted to apologize for that
misunderstanding we had last night.

228
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:51,917
Are you sure it was me that came by
the last couple of nights?

229
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,711
Listen, mister.

230
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,672
Connie called me.

231
00:29:56,755 --> 00:30:00,634
She told me that you check out,
and that's good enough for me.

232
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:04,888
I'm perfectly willing
to let it go.

233
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:08,600
But I don't drink anymore...

234
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:10,686
and I don't lie.

235
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:13,605
And as far as I know,
I'm not crazy.

236
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:16,441
So if you're accusing me...

237
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:24,408
Look, here's the thing.

238
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,121
I don't know how
I ended up here last night.

239
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:34,168
I didn't even know
I was in West Virginia.

240
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:37,421
Some how, between 1:00 and 2:30...

241
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:42,050
I traveled 400 miles and ended up
on that road by your house...

242
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:47,431
and I've got no memory of it.

243
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:52,269
And you call me crazy?

244
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:47,241
I was afraid I'd see you here.

245
00:31:58,502 --> 00:31:59,419
Okay.

246
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:04,591
You didn't show up.

247
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:07,177
Too bad. I really wanted
to know what I look like.

248
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:12,015
Sergeant, I'm curious.

249
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,101
Last night you said...

250
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:17,062
things had been strange...

251
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:18,564
around here lately.

252
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:21,900
- What kind of things?
- You really don't want to know.

253
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,028
Now I really need to know.

254
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,698
Just your odd reports.

255
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:32,119
People seeing things they can't explain,
so they all come to me.

256
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:33,787
'Cause you're the cop.

257
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,041
Because they know me.

258
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:47,342
You know, if there are
other people in this town...

259
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:49,386
who are feeling as...

260
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:52,472
confused as I am right now...

261
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:54,141
I'd sure like to hear it.

262
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:06,028
The past few months,
people have been coming up to me...

263
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:08,864
and reporting that they've
been seeing strange things.

264
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:13,493
I don't mean the town speed freak.
I mean good, honest, church going people.

265
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:16,914
I've known these folks
my entire life...

266
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:19,291
and they seem down right embarrassed
to be bringing it up.

267
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:21,126
Bringing what up?

268
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,295
It's hard to explain.

269
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:02,334
Weird lights,
strange phone calls, you.

270
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:05,921
Seeing a UFO is one thing.

271
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:09,925
What do you do when someone tells you
they saw this in their backyard?

272
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:18,767
What is it?

273
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:24,147
My wife died two years ago.

274
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:33,574
She saw something.

275
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:35,200
Drew pictures.

276
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,787
Who showed you this?

277
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,634
It was right here.

278
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:57,681
There was only a foot or so
between its head and that branch.

279
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:00,100
That makes it about...

280
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:02,352
eight feet tall.

281
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:04,271
Yeah.

282
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:08,692
I was getting ready for bed and just
happened to glance out the window.

283
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,528
At first all I could see...

284
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:15,032
were these two red eyes.

285
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:17,034
I kept looking at it.

286
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,078
I couldn't stop.

287
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:25,083
I've never had that feeling before,
like I couldn't move.

288
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:28,962
And then I guess it just...

289
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,381
took off..

290
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:40,599
That may not make much sense,
but it's...

291
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:44,061
the only way I can
put it into words.

292
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,331
You didn't see it, did you?

293
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:17,761
It started about two months ago.

294
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:22,724
Every time I answered the phone
I'd hear it.

295
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:26,562
The first one was just
a loud beeping noise.

296
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:30,858
Now they're mostly
these creaking, howling sounds.

297
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,111
They all like this?

298
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:38,031
Well, once it was a man
talking really fast.

299
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:40,784
- What'd he say?
- I couldn't make it out.

300
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:44,621
- Some foreign language.
- Have you had the line checked?

301
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:47,374
I even had our number changed.

302
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:50,878
But before I got a chance
to give it out to anyone...

303
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:54,006
the calls started again.

304
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:02,681
It's not a question of believing them.
Like I said, they're honest people.

305
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:05,267
- How long you lived here?
- My whole life.

306
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:08,145
- I grew up right over that hill.
- On a farm?

307
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:09,771
Shucks, no.
A real live house.

308
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:13,025
Indoor plumbing and everything.

309
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:14,443
Sorry.

310
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:17,029
We even had shoes for church
and schoolin' and stuff.

311
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,363
All right, all right.

312
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:25,662
Where the hell are you?

313
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:27,206
I'm still here.

314
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:29,333
- West Virginia?
- Yeah.

315
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,252
Something's come up.

316
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:35,214
You're kidding. Something of
national interest in West Virginia?

317
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:38,258
No, scientific.
I'll tell you about it later.

318
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:42,888
Cy's beginning to look rabid.

319
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:44,515
Keep him at bay, okay?

320
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:47,184
Are you okay?
You sound a little stressed.

321
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:49,686
No, I'm fine.
I'll talk to you later.

322
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:09,456
We were parked up here...

323
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,708
and sort a making out
in the back seat.

324
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:28,392
And what happened next...

325
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:30,936
is sort of hard to explain.

326
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:00,299
Next day...

327
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:04,178
I woke up and...

328
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:06,138
both my...

329
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:08,140
my eyes were swelled up.

330
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:12,895
What did the doctors say?

331
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,522
He couldn't explain it.

332
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,152
See this one here?

333
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:24,281
It ain't never healed.

334
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:31,872
We're getting engaged.

335
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:36,126
That's good.

336
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:11,346
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.

337
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:17,394
Last night I woke up...

338
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:21,565
with the worst headache
I've ever had in my life.

339
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:26,361
I went into the bathroom
to get some aspirin...

340
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:29,072
and I happened
to look in the mirror...

341
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,159
and...

342
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:34,369
I swear to God...

343
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:36,371
I see something...

344
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:38,040
I can't describe.

345
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,959
But it sure as hell...

346
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:42,794
is not my reflection.

347
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:46,006
And then...

348
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,424
I hear...

349
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:49,718
this weird...

350
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:53,347
howl...

351
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,308
coming out of the sink.

352
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:00,771
And there's a voice.

353
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,818
It's a voice...

354
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:09,905
and it's saying...

355
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:12,616
"Do not be afraid.

356
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,952
Ninety-nine will die.

357
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:18,038
Denver Nine".

358
00:42:19,957 --> 00:42:21,625
I even wrote it down.

359
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:27,214
He just keeps saying the same thing
over and over for an hour...

360
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:30,008
and then it stops.

361
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:33,095
And when I wake up this morning
I look at this piece of paper...

362
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:36,348
where I wrote down the words...

363
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:40,185
and this thing is on it.

364
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:42,938
I did not draw that.

365
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,884
- Gordon?
- What?

366
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:15,012
Gordon, you...
your ear's bleeding.

367
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:16,513
What?

368
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,490
This CAT scan is clean, Gordon.

369
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:37,451
No sign of any physical problem.

370
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:42,331
Are you sure?
Because this man's wife had a tumor.

371
00:43:42,372 --> 00:43:44,917
What you had, Gordon,
was a first-class migraine.

372
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,337
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.

373
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,923
- Thank you, Doctor.
- There were other symptoms, Doc.

374
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:54,426
He had hallucinations,
heard voices.

375
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,762
Aren't they both associated
with glioblastoma?

376
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:59,932
I see nothing here to suggest...

377
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:03,018
something as exotic
as glioblastoma, Mr. Klein...

378
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:06,605
but if you'd like I can refer
Mr. Smallwood to another neurologist...

379
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:08,649
for a second opinion.

380
00:44:09,775 --> 00:44:11,568
- He's wrong.
- No, that'd be fine.

381
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:13,028
Thank you.

382
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:16,073
Thank you very much.

383
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:23,580
Wait. Wait.

384
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:25,582
He's not wrong.

385
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,126
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.

386
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:32,548
He's not wrong
'cause there's nothing wrong.

387
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:36,844
There's nothing wrong.

388
00:45:00,158 --> 00:45:04,913
You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear
and he tells you you got a headache...

389
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:08,417
Yes, well, you're not sick,
so that is good news.

390
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:11,712
I wish I was sick. Then I would
know why this is happening.

391
00:45:11,837 --> 00:45:14,089
You shouldn't say things like that.

392
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:18,427
What should I say, Denise?
I'm hallucinating.

393
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:20,137
I'm hearing voices.

394
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,140
Was your wife hearing voices
before she had her tumor?

395
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:26,185
No.

396
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:56,924
13 News is headed to the scene,
and we'll have a live report in minutes.

397
00:45:56,924 --> 00:46:02,095
Again our top story, Domain Air
flight 9 out of Denver has crashed.

398
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:06,433
An airline representative is expected
to make a statement shortly.

399
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:07,935
There is no confirmation...

400
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:11,021
but all 99 passengers and crew members
are believed dead.

401
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:22,241
Wow, man.

402
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:33,293
Could I speak to
Alexander Leek, please?

403
00:46:33,335 --> 00:46:35,963
- This is Leek.
- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein.

404
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:38,131
I'm working on
a pretty strange story.

405
00:46:38,215 --> 00:46:40,843
I was hoping you might be able
to help me out.

406
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:45,264
I'm particularly interested in your
theories on precognition and prophecies.

407
00:46:45,347 --> 00:46:47,266
Anything you want to know
is in the book.

408
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:51,770
Yeah, but the chapter that you have
on the entities you call...

409
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:53,397
Were you contacted...

410
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,358
or are you pretending to have
a professional interest?

411
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:57,860
Yeah... No.

412
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:01,113
I'm a reporter
for The Washington Post.

413
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:04,449
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein.
I don't work in those areas anymore.

414
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:07,160
I don't understand.

415
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:22,926
To hear a voice is one thing...

416
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:26,013
but this isn't just a message,
it's a prediction.

417
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:27,598
It came true.

418
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:31,935
These things Gordon's having,
are they dreams or hallucinations?

419
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:35,272
The way he describes them,
they sound like dreams.

420
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:36,732
I don't know.

421
00:47:38,317 --> 00:47:40,235
He believes they're real.

422
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:47,034
I had a dream like that.

423
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:49,786
Yeah?

424
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,001
It was nighttime...

425
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:59,546
and I was
in the middle of the ocean.

426
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:05,344
I was trying to swim,
but I was too cold.

427
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:10,933
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something...

428
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:13,310
to hang on to.

429
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:17,397
And there were presents...

430
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:18,690
floating all around me.

431
00:48:18,774 --> 00:48:21,235
They were wrapped up.
They were tied with bows.

432
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:27,366
I tried to grab on to them,
but they kept popping away.

433
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:32,788
And then I started to sink...

434
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:35,499
like a stone.

435
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:40,671
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.

436
00:48:42,631 --> 00:48:44,550
But it felt good.

437
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,306
I was letting go.

438
00:48:55,477 --> 00:48:58,063
I was letting myself go...

439
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:00,315
and...

440
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:01,859
all I could see...

441
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:03,360
was black...

442
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:06,947
and all I could feel
was the darkness above me...

443
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,949
and the lights...

444
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:10,909
coming from below.

445
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,498
I knew I was dying.

446
00:49:19,877 --> 00:49:25,132
And then I heard this voice,
like somebody whispering in my ear.

447
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:27,509
"Wake up, number 37".

448
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:38,604
And then I woke up.

449
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:45,277
What do you think that means?

450
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,488
Number 37?

451
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:51,074
I have absolutely no idea.

452
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:26,568
I met him.

453
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:30,489
The guy who told me
about the plane crash.

454
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:34,826
You met him?

455
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:35,827
Yeah.

456
00:50:36,578 --> 00:50:38,413
I met him.

457
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:41,750
Last night, coming home
from work about midnight.

458
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:44,795
I'm driving past the cement plant...

459
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:48,048
out by the chemical factory.

460
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:49,216
Right.

461
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:51,260
Something happened.

462
00:50:58,267 --> 00:50:59,685
Bright...

463
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:01,103
flash.

464
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:02,229
Lightning.

465
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:07,568
Something...

466
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:09,111
encircles me.

467
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:16,994
Everything's kind of hot.

468
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:21,665
I feel like I can't catch...

469
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,543
catch my breath.

470
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:00,454
He looked human.

471
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:04,291
But there was just something...

472
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:05,834
wrong about him.

473
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:10,047
That's when I heard the voice.

474
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:13,008
The same voice
that I heard two nights ago.

475
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:15,511
He said...

476
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:17,513
"Do not be afraid.

477
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:20,349
My name...

478
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:23,393
is Indrid Cold".

479
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:30,359
And he said to me...

480
00:52:30,484 --> 00:52:32,444
"In a place this size.

481
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:34,988
Equator.

482
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:37,032
Three hundred.

483
00:52:37,074 --> 00:52:39,910
Three hundred will die.

484
00:52:42,704 --> 00:52:44,289
Wait for me.

485
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:46,834
I will return.

486
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:50,379
I will see you in time".

487
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:57,803
And that was it.

488
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:03,141
It's a little...

489
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:11,525
Have a look.

490
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,691
She knew.

491
00:53:54,985 --> 00:53:56,445
I didn't see anything.

492
00:54:16,298 --> 00:54:19,843
You want to hear
the chief's latest phone call?

493
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:50,666
Yes?

494
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:52,459
- Thank God you're there.
- Gordon?

495
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:55,754
I know I sounded crazy the other day,
but things are getting weird out here.

496
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:57,130
Slow down, Gordon.

497
00:54:57,214 --> 00:54:58,632
- He's here.
- Who's here?

498
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:02,302
Indrid Cold.
He's standing right next to me.

499
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:05,848
Get over to Gordon's right away.
He says Indrid Cold is there.

500
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:10,310
Gordon, let me talk to him.

501
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:13,689
Sure. Hang on.

502
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:16,483
Hello, John Klein.

503
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:20,237
Who is this?

504
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,865
My name is Indrid Cold.

505
00:55:27,286 --> 00:55:29,246
Unless, of course,
you're Gordon Smallwood.

506
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:33,709
Your father was born
in Racine, Wisconsin.

507
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:36,753
He lived in a green house
on Monroe Street.

508
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:41,592
You don't remember
how your mother looked.

509
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:45,721
Okay, you got my attention.

510
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:56,523
- Where's my watch?
- In your shoe.

511
00:55:58,442 --> 00:55:59,693
Under the bed.

512
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,387
Very good, John.
Thank you.

513
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:31,808
What's in my hand?

514
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:34,728
Chap Stick.

515
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,486
You're reading my mind,
aren't you?

516
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:44,112
Did you read my mind?

517
00:56:44,196 --> 00:56:47,282
I have no need to, do I?

518
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:54,790
What's the third line of page 51?

519
00:56:56,625 --> 00:57:01,046
"A broken smile
beneath her whispered wings".

520
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:05,008
Still more proof, John Klein?

521
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:12,975
What do you look like?

522
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:16,270
It depends on who's looking.

523
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,941
I want to meet you.

524
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:23,443
You already have, John.

525
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:26,280
I have seen you afraid.

526
00:57:26,405 --> 00:57:28,782
You're afraid right now,
aren't you?

527
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:34,413
Can I ask you something?

528
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:38,458
Why ask me
what you already know, John?

529
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:47,926
What happened to my wife?

530
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:50,304
You were there.

531
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:55,517
Mary Klein cannot be found
by looking.

532
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:57,978
You will see her in time.

533
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:24,046
What's up, Connie?

534
00:58:24,129 --> 00:58:26,256
Everything okay?

535
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:29,551
Did you just call John?

536
00:58:30,844 --> 00:58:32,804
I've been asleep since 9:00.

537
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:49,238
Unless, of course,
you're Gordon Smallwood.

538
00:58:49,321 --> 00:58:54,076
See? It's sticking up here
around 1,950 cycles per second.

539
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:58,705
But it never gets any lower
than maybe 1,930 or so.

540
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:02,709
But yours is way down here
in the normal vocal range...

541
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:06,421
anywhere between 1,000
and 1,200 cycles per second.

542
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:09,967
Okay, so this guy's vocal range
is much higher than mine.

543
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:13,595
What makes you think it's a man?

544
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:15,430
Still more proof, John Klein?

545
00:59:23,105 --> 00:59:24,690
What is it?

546
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:28,318
Near as I can tell, it's...

547
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,736
an electrical impulse.

548
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:37,160
But whatever it is, it's not
coming from human vocal cords.

549
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:39,746
Why ask me
what you already know, John?

550
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:41,582
What happened to my wife?

551
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:44,835
You were there.

552
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:49,381
Mary Klein cannot be found
by looking.

553
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:51,884
You will see her in time.

554
00:59:56,388 --> 01:00:00,851
This isn't like you. We used to rip on
this stuff. when it came over the wire.

555
01:00:00,893 --> 01:00:02,019
Yeah, I know.

556
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:05,772
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.

557
01:00:05,856 --> 01:00:08,901
Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu. Any excuse.

558
01:00:08,984 --> 01:00:10,360
I'll back you up.

559
01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:13,071
I just wanna make sure
you still got a job...

560
01:00:13,197 --> 01:00:16,700
when you're done doing
whatever it is you're doing down there.

561
01:00:16,825 --> 01:00:18,785
Okay, I'll call you from Chicago.

562
01:00:22,873 --> 01:00:24,124
What time is your flight?

563
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:27,836
8:00 a.m.

564
01:00:31,924 --> 01:00:33,175
Am I crazy?

565
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:38,096
No.

566
01:00:42,476 --> 01:00:44,144
I am crazy.

567
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:28,689
Alexander Leek.

568
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:34,736
- Who the hell are you?
-John Klein. I called you last week.

569
01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:37,948
Do you know what that is?

570
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:41,910
Stay away.

571
01:01:43,996 --> 01:01:46,957
I need to know what this is.
Tell me.

572
01:01:50,169 --> 01:01:52,171
Where are they seeing it?

573
01:01:52,212 --> 01:01:54,173
Point Pleasant, West Virginia.

574
01:01:57,634 --> 01:01:59,553
You can help me.

575
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:04,016
Follow me.

576
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:13,025
The nocturnal butterfly.

577
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:17,279
In ancient cultures, the moth
represents a form of the psyche...

578
01:02:17,362 --> 01:02:20,115
or the soul immortally trapped...

579
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:23,744
in the hellish death realms.

580
01:02:25,746 --> 01:02:27,164
Mothman.

581
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:33,378
That's what the Ukranians called him.
Rough translation, of course.

582
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:37,674
There were 100 sightings in Chernobyl
the year the nuclear plant went down.

583
01:02:37,758 --> 01:02:41,011
Galveston, 1969,
just before the hurricane.

584
01:02:41,053 --> 01:02:42,513
They saw it.

585
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,558
But seeing isn't always believing.

586
01:02:49,686 --> 01:02:52,606
Look, there's never been
a single shred of evidence...

587
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:57,444
to show that these things
exist materially.

588
01:02:57,569 --> 01:03:00,322
So you're telling me
these things do not exist?

589
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:05,202
Oh, they exist. All kinds of things
exist around us that we never see.

590
01:03:05,285 --> 01:03:09,039
Electricity, microwaves,
infrared waves.

591
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:12,417
You know, these things
have been around forever.

592
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:15,629
They show up in cave paintings.

593
01:03:15,712 --> 01:03:18,215
They're a normal condition
of the planet.

594
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:24,638
They're just not part of our consensus
of what constitutes...

595
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:27,808
physical reality.

596
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:30,143
What are they part of, then?

597
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:35,023
You're asking for an explanation...

598
01:03:35,148 --> 01:03:36,567
for something...

599
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:42,197
that can't be explained
rationally.

600
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:51,540
You know the buildup of energy
before something happens?

601
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:55,085
The way your hair stands up
before lightning strikes?

602
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:59,423
"Before something happens".
Do you mean they cause disasters?

603
01:04:00,257 --> 01:04:02,092
Why would they need to?

604
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:04,887
All right, then...

605
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:06,972
are they trying to warn me?

606
01:04:10,475 --> 01:04:12,227
Their motivations...

607
01:04:13,812 --> 01:04:15,230
aren't human.

608
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:20,569
All right,
then what do they want?

609
01:04:20,652 --> 01:04:22,571
I have no idea.

610
01:04:24,031 --> 01:04:26,074
What you really want
is to know...

611
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:29,244
why you?

612
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:32,998
Yes.

613
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:38,712
You noticed them,
and they noticed that you noticed them.

614
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:44,218
Most people aren't sensitive enough
to see them...

615
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,929
without some kind of...

616
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:51,058
trauma.

617
01:04:53,685 --> 01:04:55,896
What happened to you, Mr. Klein?

618
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:03,654
Last week my friend
got a strange phone call...

619
01:05:03,737 --> 01:05:05,864
from an entity...

620
01:05:07,115 --> 01:05:08,700
a spirit, whatever.

621
01:05:10,577 --> 01:05:12,621
It seemed to know everything.

622
01:05:12,746 --> 01:05:14,164
Like God?

623
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:17,501
- It made predictions that came true?
- Yes.

624
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:20,003
His name was Indrid Cold.

625
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:24,216
It's perception, John.
They appear differently to everyone.

626
01:05:24,258 --> 01:05:27,511
A voice, a light, a man, a monster.

627
01:05:27,594 --> 01:05:32,266
If your friend thinks it's God he spoke
to, he's off by more than a few degrees.

628
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:34,768
Then how do you explain
that it knows everything?

629
01:05:36,645 --> 01:05:37,896
Look at that.

630
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:43,610
If there was a car crash 10 blocks away,
that window washer could likely see it.

631
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:46,655
That doesn't mean he's God...

632
01:05:46,738 --> 01:05:48,657
or even smarter than we are.

633
01:05:49,992 --> 01:05:52,786
But from where he's sitting...

634
01:05:52,828 --> 01:05:55,789
he can see
a little further down the road.

635
01:05:56,915 --> 01:05:59,668
I think we can assume that...

636
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:01,670
these entities
are more advanced than us.

637
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:06,341
Why don't they just come right out
and tell us what's on their minds?

638
01:06:06,425 --> 01:06:08,427
You're more advanced
than a cockroach.

639
01:06:08,468 --> 01:06:11,430
Have you ever tried explaining yourself
to one of them?

640
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:18,645
How many people have seen it?

641
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:20,689
Ten. Twenty, maybe.

642
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:29,281
Listen to me. Something terrible
is going to happen in Point Pleasant.

643
01:06:30,866 --> 01:06:32,451
Don't go back.

644
01:06:33,911 --> 01:06:35,370
Stay away.

645
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:39,750
I can't talk about this anymore.

646
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:52,346
There is a reason...

647
01:06:52,471 --> 01:06:54,515
that I ended up in Point Pleasant.

648
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:58,352
Something brought me there.

649
01:06:58,477 --> 01:07:00,479
Whatever brought you there...

650
01:07:02,064 --> 01:07:03,982
brought you there to die.

651
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:51,530
You're just in time. They're just
about to light this Christmas tree.

652
01:07:51,613 --> 01:07:54,032
They have been
for the last two hours.

653
01:07:55,367 --> 01:07:57,411
Isn't that Denise?

654
01:07:57,494 --> 01:07:59,454
Is she okay?

655
01:07:59,538 --> 01:08:00,956
She left Gordon.

656
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:05,502
He got fired from the chemical plant.
Just stopped coming to work one day.

657
01:08:05,586 --> 01:08:06,545
Shit.

658
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:10,757
- Where is he?
- Who knows?

659
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:16,054
Be back in a second.

660
01:08:20,017 --> 01:08:22,019
Connie.

661
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:23,478
What's wrong?

662
01:08:25,147 --> 01:08:28,108
Fifteen more people
reported seeing that thing today.

663
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:30,402
Fifteen.
Three of them were cops.

664
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:36,116
I hate this, John.
I absolutely goddamn hate this.

665
01:08:43,248 --> 01:08:45,167
How was Chicago?

666
01:08:48,712 --> 01:08:50,672
What did he say?

667
01:08:52,758 --> 01:08:54,676
He wouldn't see me.

668
01:09:13,111 --> 01:09:15,030
Shit.

669
01:09:40,472 --> 01:09:41,932
You all right?

670
01:09:49,022 --> 01:09:51,567
It's cold.
Get in the car, warm up.

671
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:54,152
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.

672
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:03,537
Everybody in this town is looking at me
like I'm insane. You know why?

673
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:11,336
Denise and all the others,
they don't know, John.

674
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,880
I do.

675
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:19,386
I don't think you're crazy.

676
01:10:19,469 --> 01:10:21,096
Okay?

677
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:23,557
You talked to him too, John.

678
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:28,896
You know...

679
01:10:28,937 --> 01:10:31,857
I've been lying awake at night.

680
01:10:33,108 --> 01:10:34,568
I feel...

681
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:37,738
like I'm sleeping...

682
01:10:38,822 --> 01:10:40,282
but I'm awake.

683
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,704
That's when I hear him.

684
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:48,248
And lately, when I hear him...

685
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:51,126
all at once...

686
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:55,589
I understand.

687
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:01,053
Everything.

688
01:11:05,307 --> 01:11:09,895
John, do you remember
the last time you were happy?

689
01:11:25,494 --> 01:11:26,954
It's real.

690
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,000
These things are real.

691
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

692
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:03,824
I want you to be happy.

693
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:16,003
Yeah?

694
01:12:18,672 --> 01:12:20,257
What?

695
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:23,260
This is your wake-up call,
Mr. Klein.

696
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:25,762
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.

697
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

698
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:13,852
What happened to you, Mr. Klein?

699
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,739
I can't believe I got through.

700
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:28,909
Gordon, where are you, man?

701
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:30,452
Speak up.

702
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:33,288
Listen, John, he was right.

703
01:13:33,372 --> 01:13:35,707
Mr. Cold was right
about everything.

704
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:39,086
Right? Right about what?
I can't hear you.

705
01:13:39,127 --> 01:13:41,046
He was right about understanding.

706
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:44,925
It's real, John.
I want you to know.

707
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:48,220
- It's real.
- What is... What are you talking about?

708
01:13:48,262 --> 01:13:51,598
You've got nothing to worry about.

709
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:53,600
I'll see you in time.

710
01:14:20,377 --> 01:14:21,670
Gordon?

711
01:15:57,307 --> 01:15:59,726
Can they tell how long
he was out there?

712
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:03,063
Looks like he's been dead
about eight hours.

713
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:06,441
He died of exposure.

714
01:16:08,402 --> 01:16:10,612
What made you come out here?

715
01:16:15,492 --> 01:16:17,786
- He called me.
- When?

716
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:20,539
I didn't like
the way he sounded.

717
01:16:20,664 --> 01:16:23,083
When did he call you, John?

718
01:16:28,213 --> 01:16:29,673
About an hour ago.

719
01:16:32,342 --> 01:16:33,760
I can't stand this.

720
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:23,185
It didn't seem right
to bring this up at the funeral...

721
01:17:23,268 --> 01:17:26,647
but as far as I know there's never been
any accidents at the chemical plant.

722
01:17:27,523 --> 01:17:29,399
I don't know
what you're talking about.

723
01:17:29,483 --> 01:17:34,488
I got your message the other day.
I meant to call you back, but I forgot.

724
01:17:36,907 --> 01:17:39,493
Don't you remember
leaving me that message?

725
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:42,120
Chief, this is John Klein.

726
01:17:42,204 --> 01:17:44,414
I didn't call him.
No, it's not me.

727
01:17:44,456 --> 01:17:47,292
I analyzed both tapes
with the voice print.

728
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:50,796
I don't care.
It may be my voice. It's not me.

729
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:53,257
- It is not me.
- Listen to me.

730
01:17:53,298 --> 01:17:56,802
I would swear in a court of law
that that's your voice.

731
01:17:56,885 --> 01:17:58,929
Yeah, great. Thanks.

732
01:18:00,639 --> 01:18:01,557
Shit!

733
01:18:30,836 --> 01:18:33,005
Regular coffee to go, please.

734
01:18:33,797 --> 01:18:34,840
Seventy-five cents.

735
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:39,887
Have a great day.

736
01:18:50,147 --> 01:18:51,565
Do you know that woman?

737
01:18:53,025 --> 01:18:56,028
- What woman?
- She just left. You didn't see her?

738
01:18:56,111 --> 01:18:58,071
- No.
- That's strange.

739
01:18:58,071 --> 01:19:02,576
She had long red hair, green eyes, real
pretty, and she was asking about you.

740
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:21,595
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.

741
01:19:22,846 --> 01:19:26,391
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.

742
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:29,937
What are you doing here?
And she asked if you were happy.

743
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:35,108
- What did you say?
- I asked her for some ID.

744
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:36,610
- Did she give you any?
- No.

745
01:19:36,693 --> 01:19:41,114
She just said "Tell John I'm sorry for
ruining everything", and then she left.

746
01:19:43,617 --> 01:19:44,743
What's wrong?

747
01:19:49,331 --> 01:19:50,249
Was it her?

748
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:52,167
Was it her?

749
01:19:55,212 --> 01:19:56,588
That's your wife?

750
01:19:57,256 --> 01:19:58,674
It was her.

751
01:19:59,883 --> 01:20:02,261
- I'm not sure.
- What?

752
01:20:02,302 --> 01:20:03,971
I mean, the hair is different.

753
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:06,265
- Oh, come on!
- What?

754
01:20:06,348 --> 01:20:09,852
- This is the woman you saw.
- No, it isn't, John.

755
01:20:09,935 --> 01:20:12,479
Now, I agree
there is a similarity...

756
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:13,856
Bullshit!

757
01:20:19,528 --> 01:20:21,113
John, it's all right.

758
01:20:21,154 --> 01:20:23,115
I'm not all right.

759
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:29,079
This is the woman you saw.
She was here. This woman.

760
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,711
Don't you do this to me.

761
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:31,183
I'm sorry, John.

762
01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:33,685
I feel like
I've ruined everything.

763
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:35,521
I feel like
I've ruined everything.

764
01:21:41,652 --> 01:21:43,028
I'm so sorry.

765
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:21,984
I need to know
what happened to you.

766
01:22:23,402 --> 01:22:25,779
Please.

767
01:22:25,863 --> 01:22:27,322
Come in.

768
01:22:32,786 --> 01:22:36,707
I was a physics professor
at Cornell.

769
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:39,501
Tenured.
You can look me up.

770
01:22:40,586 --> 01:22:43,380
One day
I started hearing voices.

771
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:47,801
The voices became messages.

772
01:22:47,843 --> 01:22:50,929
Before long, I was fully convinced
that I was receiving...

773
01:22:51,013 --> 01:22:54,892
predictions of disaster
from outside intelligences.

774
01:22:54,933 --> 01:22:56,435
But you were, weren't you?

775
01:22:56,518 --> 01:22:58,937
John, I had tapes
of their voices.

776
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:03,775
I knew a building was going to blow up,
and I tried to prevent it...

777
01:23:03,901 --> 01:23:07,070
but no one listened.

778
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:10,574
What happened?

779
01:23:10,616 --> 01:23:11,992
People died.

780
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:17,956
Many people died.

781
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:23,420
I was investigated,
almost arrested.

782
01:23:25,047 --> 01:23:26,965
My wife divorced me.

783
01:23:28,258 --> 01:23:30,469
My kids...

784
01:23:30,552 --> 01:23:32,763
stopped speaking to me.

785
01:23:37,142 --> 01:23:40,854
Do you know what four years in
a psychiatric hospital can do to you?

786
01:23:42,898 --> 01:23:44,775
Everything...

787
01:23:44,858 --> 01:23:46,693
gone.

788
01:23:47,986 --> 01:23:51,240
Oh, you'll never understand
their messages.

789
01:23:51,323 --> 01:23:53,534
You'll misinterpret them.

790
01:23:53,617 --> 01:23:56,286
I did.
It almost destroyed me.

791
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:59,498
In the end,
it all came down to just...

792
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:01,625
one simple question.

793
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:04,962
Which was more important...

794
01:24:05,045 --> 01:24:07,047
having proof...

795
01:24:09,132 --> 01:24:11,051
or being alive?

796
01:24:15,138 --> 01:24:16,306
Trust me.

797
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:19,184
I turned away years ago...

798
01:24:19,268 --> 01:24:21,520
and I've never looked back.

799
01:24:24,648 --> 01:24:27,025
Didn't you need to know?

800
01:24:32,656 --> 01:24:34,825
We're not allowed to know.

801
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:19,930
It's me, Cyrus.

802
01:26:19,972 --> 01:26:21,974
John, is that you?

803
01:26:22,099 --> 01:26:23,684
Yeah.

804
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:24,852
Yeah, it's me.

805
01:26:24,977 --> 01:26:27,312
Whatever you are doing,
you drop it.

806
01:26:27,354 --> 01:26:29,314
Governor McCallum
is going to Charleston.

807
01:26:29,356 --> 01:26:32,317
Then he's touring that chemical plant
in Point Pleasant today.

808
01:26:32,401 --> 01:26:35,195
Now, I want you to go down there...

809
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:37,489
and meet him at the airport.

810
01:26:39,533 --> 01:26:41,869
You listening?

811
01:26:41,952 --> 01:26:44,454
Yeah, McCal I um...
at the chemical plant. Got it.

812
01:26:44,538 --> 01:26:47,374
I need to know that
you're gonna be there.

813
01:26:47,457 --> 01:26:49,376
John, are you there?

814
01:27:05,809 --> 01:27:07,311
Ohio.

815
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:12,191
Great tragedy
on the River Ohio.

816
01:27:13,609 --> 01:27:18,572
Great tragedy
on the River Ohio.

817
01:27:24,036 --> 01:27:27,331
I can't call in sick just because
you have a bad feeling about today.

818
01:27:27,456 --> 01:27:31,418
Just think about this.
Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.

819
01:27:31,543 --> 01:27:33,462
They show up
over the chemical plant.

820
01:27:33,545 --> 01:27:35,714
Josh gets a call from me,
but it's not really me.

821
01:27:35,797 --> 01:27:40,177
I'm talking about something bad
happening at the chemical plant.

822
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:43,180
Then I get this message
from this Indrid Cold...

823
01:27:43,263 --> 01:27:46,892
who's talking about
a great tragedy on the Ohio River.

824
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:50,354
Guess what's on the Ohio River.

825
01:27:50,437 --> 01:27:51,980
The chemical plant.

826
01:27:53,273 --> 01:27:56,443
Today Governor McCallum
is gonna be there.

827
01:27:56,527 --> 01:27:59,279
I was on my way to interview him.
That's how I ended...

828
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:06,411
That's how I ended up here.

829
01:28:09,915 --> 01:28:11,625
My God.

830
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:13,752
That's why I'm here.

831
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:16,922
He was right.

832
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:19,591
Who was right?

833
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:24,179
You saw Leek.

834
01:28:24,263 --> 01:28:26,348
- He was part of the warning.
- What?

835
01:28:26,431 --> 01:28:29,518
He was part of the warning.
Stop, stop, stop.

836
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:31,895
I didn't want to scare you.

837
01:28:34,398 --> 01:28:35,774
He said...

838
01:28:36,942 --> 01:28:38,902
He said the messages are real.

839
01:28:40,696 --> 01:28:42,948
Something terrible
is gonna happen.

840
01:28:45,242 --> 01:28:46,660
Connie, please.

841
01:28:49,872 --> 01:28:51,957
We have to leave here now.

842
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,001
I will not live
my life like that.

843
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:58,422
I will not make decisions based
on messages from Indrid Cold.

844
01:28:58,463 --> 01:29:00,340
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.

845
01:29:02,968 --> 01:29:04,928
Okay, I'm going to Charleston.

846
01:29:05,012 --> 01:29:06,972
I'll be at the Marriott.
Get yourself reassigned.

847
01:29:07,055 --> 01:29:08,974
I don't want you anywhere
near the plant today.

848
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:10,517
What if nothing happens?

849
01:29:12,436 --> 01:29:15,772
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?

850
01:29:15,856 --> 01:29:17,983
- That's not the point.
- Well, I think it is the point.

851
01:29:18,066 --> 01:29:21,361
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!

852
01:29:23,405 --> 01:29:25,991
I know what's gonna happen.

853
01:29:28,202 --> 01:29:30,579
You have to leave now.

854
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:34,374
I have to report to work.
We can talk about this later.

855
01:30:08,909 --> 01:30:11,203
- Governor?
- Good to see you, John.

856
01:30:11,286 --> 01:30:13,664
I need to speak with you.
It's urgent.

857
01:30:13,747 --> 01:30:16,124
- What's this about, John?
- It's the tour.

858
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:17,876
You can't do it. You can't go.

859
01:30:18,919 --> 01:30:21,964
Listen to me.
Cancel it. Cancel the tour.

860
01:30:22,047 --> 01:30:25,509
Cancel it. Make them
shut down the plant now.

861
01:30:25,592 --> 01:30:27,511
The plant's gonna blow up
while you're there.

862
01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:31,431
Where are the cops?
What are they doing?

863
01:30:31,515 --> 01:30:33,600
- This is McCallum's chief aide.
- They don't know yet.

864
01:30:33,684 --> 01:30:35,936
Have you received a bomb threat?

865
01:30:36,019 --> 01:30:39,231
I didn't say anything about a bomb.
There's a source.

866
01:30:39,273 --> 01:30:42,734
- I know this sounds...
- You're messing up here, John.

867
01:30:46,488 --> 01:30:49,283
Get me Cyrus Bills at the Post.

868
01:30:59,376 --> 01:31:02,462
Our top story takes us tonight
to Point Pleasant...

869
01:31:02,546 --> 01:31:05,465
- where Virginia Governor McCallum...
- Turn it up!

870
01:31:05,549 --> 01:31:07,634
toured the Edgewater
Petrochemical plant.

871
01:31:07,718 --> 01:31:10,053
In what he's called
a successful review...

872
01:31:10,137 --> 01:31:13,724
Governor McCallum has given
high marks to this petrochemical plant.

873
01:31:13,807 --> 01:31:16,685
He is expected to call
for similar renovations...

874
01:31:16,768 --> 01:31:18,896
at several Virginia plants.

875
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:21,315
WOWK-TV 13...

876
01:31:21,398 --> 01:31:24,943
has an exclusive look inside
at what the governor saw.

877
01:31:25,068 --> 01:31:26,403
Son of a bitch.

878
01:31:26,486 --> 01:31:29,907
I congratulate my friends
at Edgewater Petrochemical...

879
01:31:29,948 --> 01:31:32,284
on a job well done.

880
01:31:33,493 --> 01:31:35,120
- Success here at Point Pleasant...
- Excuse me, Mr. Klein.

881
01:31:35,162 --> 01:31:37,122
You have a message.

882
01:32:04,358 --> 01:32:05,776
Come in.

883
01:32:16,662 --> 01:32:18,622
- Back to Washington?
- Yeah.

884
01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:21,959
- Do you have to go?
- I have to go.

885
01:32:24,545 --> 01:32:27,673
- If this is about today...
- No, it's not.

886
01:32:29,216 --> 01:32:31,134
I got a message.

887
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:35,222
I have to go home.

888
01:32:35,305 --> 01:32:38,392
I have to be there noon
on Friday.

889
01:32:38,433 --> 01:32:40,686
John, do you realize
what's happening to you?

890
01:32:45,607 --> 01:32:47,734
I have to go.

891
01:34:12,236 --> 01:34:14,154
Hey, it's me.

892
01:34:15,781 --> 01:34:17,741
- Connie?
- Yeah.

893
01:34:17,783 --> 01:34:21,537
I thought we could chat
for, say, 10 or 15 minutes.

894
01:34:27,668 --> 01:34:30,671
- I'm sorry. Can I call you back?
- No,you can't.

895
01:34:31,839 --> 01:34:34,591
- I booked you a flight.
- What?

896
01:34:34,675 --> 01:34:37,636
It leaves Dulles
for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45.

897
01:34:39,972 --> 01:34:44,268
I tried to get you on the one to
Charleston, but they're all booked up.

898
01:34:44,351 --> 01:34:46,854
So if you leave now,
you'll just make it.

899
01:34:46,937 --> 01:34:48,647
I can't.

900
01:34:51,567 --> 01:34:54,111
It's Christmas Eve, John.

901
01:34:54,194 --> 01:34:56,154
You shouldn't be alone.

902
01:35:00,826 --> 01:35:01,994
I can't.

903
01:35:02,077 --> 01:35:03,996
Yeah, you can.

904
01:35:05,998 --> 01:35:07,457
You know...

905
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,253
when Mary got sick...

906
01:35:11,336 --> 01:35:13,505
I couldn't help thinking...

907
01:35:13,589 --> 01:35:15,465
this isn't real.

908
01:35:16,592 --> 01:35:18,844
I can stop this.

909
01:35:18,927 --> 01:35:21,305
I know I can.
I can stop this.

910
01:35:22,306 --> 01:35:24,766
No one can stop it, John.

911
01:35:25,851 --> 01:35:27,769
Listen to me.

912
01:35:28,854 --> 01:35:32,608
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.

913
01:35:32,691 --> 01:35:35,027
People you know and love
are going to die...

914
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:38,447
and no matter what
that voice tells you...

915
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:41,825
there's nothing
you can do about it.

916
01:35:44,077 --> 01:35:46,622
It's two years to the day.

917
01:35:47,706 --> 01:35:51,835
He told me that she's going to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.

918
01:35:51,919 --> 01:35:53,128
He's lying.

919
01:35:55,339 --> 01:35:58,509
Whoever calls
may sound like her...

920
01:35:58,592 --> 01:36:00,719
but it's not gonna be her.

921
01:36:01,803 --> 01:36:04,389
I don't know what happens to us
after we die...

922
01:36:04,473 --> 01:36:07,100
but I'll bet you
wherever Mary is now...

923
01:36:07,184 --> 01:36:09,770
she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.

924
01:36:12,064 --> 01:36:13,982
What if it is her?

925
01:36:19,363 --> 01:36:21,281
She's dead, John.

926
01:36:23,575 --> 01:36:27,538
The only important question now is
how do you want to remember her?

927
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:33,877
I miss her so much.

928
01:36:33,961 --> 01:36:36,713
I know you do.
Of course you do.

929
01:36:36,755 --> 01:36:38,715
But, John, listen...

930
01:36:39,842 --> 01:36:42,845
you can miss her here
just as easily as there.

931
01:36:42,928 --> 01:36:46,265
Even more easily because there,
you're all alone.

932
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,103
And that's just no way to be.

933
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:57,401
You do whatever you need to do...

934
01:36:57,484 --> 01:36:59,403
and I'll understand.

935
01:37:00,863 --> 01:37:03,866
But here,
we have dinner at 6:00...

936
01:37:05,075 --> 01:37:07,327
and we open presents at 8:00.

937
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:11,540
And we hope we see you.

938
01:37:14,001 --> 01:37:15,419
Okay?

939
01:37:20,465 --> 01:37:21,925
Bye, John.

940
01:39:40,898 --> 01:39:44,401
WJMP time is 5:51
on this chilly Christmas Eve.

941
01:40:18,519 --> 01:40:20,270
Come on.

942
01:40:45,879 --> 01:40:50,425
- You know what's going on down there?
- Some problem with the traffic lights.

943
01:40:50,509 --> 01:40:51,969
Shit.

944
01:41:33,886 --> 01:41:37,514
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.

945
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:51,737
My God...

946
01:42:35,322 --> 01:42:37,866
Get off the bridge!
Everyone's gotta get off the bridge!

947
01:42:43,163 --> 01:42:45,707
Get off! Everyone get out
of your cars and get off!

948
01:42:47,376 --> 01:42:49,586
C.J., come on!

949
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:51,964
You've gotta get off.
Turn the damn thing down.

950
01:42:52,005 --> 01:42:54,174
- What?
- You gotta get off the bridge now!

951
01:43:24,162 --> 01:43:27,207
- Get out! Get out!
- Let's go!

952
01:43:40,804 --> 01:43:44,016
Get off!
Get off the bridge!

953
01:43:46,143 --> 01:43:47,769
Oh, God!

954
01:43:55,819 --> 01:43:57,112
Go!

955
01:44:01,742 --> 01:44:04,036
Get out of the car!
Get off the bridge!

956
01:44:05,621 --> 01:44:07,372
Quick!

957
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:16,715
Let's get out!

958
01:44:24,932 --> 01:44:26,767
Get out!

959
01:44:42,407 --> 01:44:43,450
Get out!

960
01:44:46,745 --> 01:44:49,206
Come on. Get out.

961
01:44:50,082 --> 01:44:52,501
All units, this is unit 64.

962
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:05,514
Get out!

963
01:45:15,023 --> 01:45:16,692
Signal 33 on the Silver Bridge.

964
01:45:44,928 --> 01:45:46,847
Rose, do you copy?

965
01:45:49,808 --> 01:45:53,145
Signal 33 on the Silver Bridge...

966
01:48:25,005 --> 01:48:27,007
Wake up. Wake up.

967
01:48:34,223 --> 01:48:36,475
Here we go.

968
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:23,999
You are here.

969
01:50:25,417 --> 01:50:27,753
I didn't know
if I was dreaming or...

970
01:50:27,836 --> 01:50:29,963
I left DC right after you called.

971
01:50:32,341 --> 01:50:34,092
You did call me, right?

972
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:38,180
Yeah.

973
01:50:39,389 --> 01:50:41,183
Yeah, I called.

974
01:50:46,605 --> 01:50:49,024
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.

975
01:50:50,651 --> 01:50:53,403
But I supposed
it could've been a lot worse.

976
01:50:55,948 --> 01:50:58,909
Are they done with the search?

977
01:50:58,992 --> 01:51:00,577
Thirty-six.

978
01:51:02,788 --> 01:51:05,249
Looks like about 36 people.

979
01:51:06,375 --> 01:51:07,459
Jesus.

980
01:51:18,178 --> 01:51:19,596
Thirty-six?

981
01:51:22,766 --> 01:51:24,184
Thirty-six?

982
01:51:31,984 --> 01:51:34,278
Wake up, number 37.

983
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,900
Wake up
