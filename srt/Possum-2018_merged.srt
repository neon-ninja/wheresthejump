2
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:41,555
Mother, Father, what's afoot?

3
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:44,515
Only Possum, black as soot.

4
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:47,307
Mother, Father, where to tread?

5
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:50,515
Far from Possum and his head.

6
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:55,555
Here's a bag, now what's inside?

7
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,223
Does he seek or does he hide?

8
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,891
Can you spy him, deep within?

9
00:01:03,223 --> 00:01:06,307
Little Possum, black as sin.

10
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:33,431
- Did you hear about it?
- I know where that happened.

11
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:34,515
Where?

12
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,683
- He doesn't know.
- All right.

13
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:38,975
- Where, then?
- Fallmarsh Woods.

14
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:40,975
Liar.
They ain't even said who it was.

15
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:44,307
- Besides, it was the old army barracks.
- Whereabouts?

16
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,599
Fallmarsh Woods,
the police said.

17
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:47,683
Liar.

18
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:50,515
Well, my uncle told me,
and his neighbour's a policeman.

19
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,599
Bollocks is he.

20
00:03:51,683 --> 00:03:53,847
He knows all about you.

21
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:57,015
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop! Why you hittin' me? Stop.

22
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:01,307
- Stop, both of you. Stop.
- Fallmarsh, next stop.

23
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:16,431
What were you drawing?

24
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:57,807
Maurice?

25
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:21,807
Bag is open, growing wider.

26
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:25,639
What's inside, man or spider?

27
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:28,475
Little boy, don't lose your way.

28
00:10:28,555 --> 00:10:30,723
Possum wants to come and play.

29
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:55,099
Going in?

30
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,639
No.

31
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:28,767
Mind of its own?

32
00:12:41,055 --> 00:12:43,099
The legs are impressive.

33
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:48,099
- What exactly is it?
- It's a puppet.

34
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:53,555
You show that to children?

35
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,267
I'm destroying it.

36
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:01,139
Even the head?

37
00:13:10,975 --> 00:13:13,807
I heard about your performance.

38
00:13:16,223 --> 00:13:19,515
An old teaching colleague of mine
wrote to me.

39
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,723
A scandal, by all accounts.

40
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:25,099
They'll take me back, once that's gone.

41
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:31,683
Now you won't get something
from the jar.

42
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:36,475
May I have a demonstration?

43
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:40,683
I wanna see how the legs work.

44
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:45,015
Before you kill it.

45
00:13:46,223 --> 00:13:47,975
Can't kill it, it's a puppet.

46
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,683
Burn it, will you?

47
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,683
This place is disgusting, Maurice.

48
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:16,307
King of the castle.

49
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:23,683
Remember, a demonstration.

50
00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:32,515
Look at Possum, there he lies.

51
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:35,683
Children, meet his lifeless eyes.

52
00:16:37,055 --> 00:16:39,475
See his nasty legs and tongue.

53
00:16:40,223 --> 00:16:43,099
When he wakens, watch him run.

54
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:45,307
Philip!

55
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:32,891
Come in.

56
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,099
I want to borrow the tools.

57
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:44,307
Please?

58
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:12,807
- Hungry?
- No.

59
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:15,099
Roast fox.

60
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:17,767
Funny.

61
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,431
Dismantling it, are you?

62
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:27,475
- In my own time, yeah.
- Pity.

63
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:30,891
Puppetry's the one thing
you were good at.

64
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:33,683
Staying, are you?

65
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:37,891
For a while. My house.

66
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:50,099
Remember this one?

67
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:53,847
Well made.

68
00:18:54,475 --> 00:18:56,515
My father taught me, you know.

69
00:18:57,099 --> 00:19:00,391
- Runs in the family.
- You're not my father, Maurice.

70
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:09,891
Bring 'em back.

71
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:37,847
Police are investigating
the disappearance of a 14-year-old boy

72
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:39,723
near Fullmarsh, in Norfolk.

73
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:42,475
Officers are searching
local woodlands and waste ground

74
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:44,267
in an effort to find the teenager,

75
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:47,683
who was last seen on his way home
from Marshwood Secondary School

76
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:50,683
in the area of Full...

77
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:20,307
Is that you, pervert?

78
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:33,683
Come on.

79
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:58,307
Can I ask what you're doing?

80
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:01,183
Nothing.

81
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:03,639
Why are you waiting there?

82
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,683
Used to be my school.

83
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:11,223
Move on, will you?

84
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:17,639
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

85
00:22:48,723 --> 00:22:50,891
Philip!

86
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:35,723
Wait awhile, my little child,
for what is playing dead.

87
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:41,099
Possum, with his black balloons,
will eat you up in bed.

88
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

89
00:28:48,183 --> 00:28:49,891
Waking up, is it?

90
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:52,223
Wants to get out.

91
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:18,891
Something from the jar?

92
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,055
What's in them?

93
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:38,723
Same as always.

94
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:41,099
No, then.

95
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:44,767
All grown up now.

96
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,891
Tell me again about the fox.

97
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:23,223
Why?

98
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,847
Why not?

99
00:30:29,055 --> 00:30:30,055
No.

100
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:32,515
Tell me.

101
00:30:38,267 --> 00:30:40,267
We were on the marshes,

102
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:41,891
me and the other boys.

103
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:44,931
I'd built a den there.

104
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:47,099
Out by the bridges there.

105
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,055
I wanted to show 'em.

106
00:30:53,183 --> 00:30:56,267
When we got there, we found a fox.

107
00:30:56,975 --> 00:31:00,099
Thought it had swallowed something,
'cause it was pantin'.

108
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:03,515
Whole body was shakin'
like it was dyin'.

109
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:08,683
They started to kick it.

110
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:11,683
All of 'em. Yeah.

111
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,099
Kicked it around like it was a ball...

112
00:31:23,475 --> 00:31:25,599
Then stuck things in it,
till it was dead.

113
00:31:27,891 --> 00:31:29,099
Then what?

114
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,683
Wanted me to pick it up.

115
00:31:34,347 --> 00:31:35,683
Made me.

116
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,639
They grabbed my head,

117
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:42,683
pushed my face inside
where it was rotten.

118
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,683
I started to cry.

119
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,891
They laughed.

120
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:57,475
Ran off and left me.

121
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:03,683
And then after a while...

122
00:32:07,015 --> 00:32:08,307
the fox...

123
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:12,099
opened its eyes and stared at me.

124
00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:17,099
Stood up and walked away.

125
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:28,767
There.

126
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:41,307
Sly bugger.

127
00:32:42,223 --> 00:32:43,683
Playin' with ya.

128
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:53,475
Yours, I believe.

129
00:32:57,807 --> 00:32:59,431
Like this house, Maurice.

130
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:14,267
They're demolishing the old barracks.

131
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:18,099
About bloody time.

132
00:33:19,391 --> 00:33:21,475
Black as sin, it is.

133
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:49,807
Going in?

134
00:41:19,391 --> 00:41:20,391
Maurice?

135
00:42:12,015 --> 00:42:18,183
"Possum.
How he came into the world. 1978."

136
00:42:19,055 --> 00:42:21,099
"By Philip Connell."

137
00:42:25,767 --> 00:42:28,807
"After the fire. Possum."

138
00:42:30,307 --> 00:42:34,183
"Was it he who blackened
the very sun above our town?"

139
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:41,183
"Possum. Does his stare not seem
like the face of waking death?"

140
00:42:43,055 --> 00:42:46,599
"Behold how he came into the world."

141
00:42:49,475 --> 00:42:56,099
"Mother, Father, what's afoot?
Only Possum, black as soot."

142
00:42:57,807 --> 00:43:00,807
"Mother, Father, where to tread?"

143
00:43:02,223 --> 00:43:04,975
"Far from Possum and his head."

144
00:43:07,975 --> 00:43:14,183
"Wait awhile, my little child,
for what is playing dead."

145
00:43:14,267 --> 00:43:17,183
"Possum, with his black balloons,

146
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:19,975
will eat you up in bed."

147
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,599
"Look at Possum, there he lies."

148
00:43:26,347 --> 00:43:29,807
"Children, meet his lifeless eyes."

149
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:38,599
"See his nasty legs and tongue.
When he wakens, watch him run."

150
00:43:40,391 --> 00:43:43,599
"Here's a bag, now what's inside?"

151
00:43:44,975 --> 00:43:47,975
"Does he seek, or does he hide?"

152
00:43:49,015 --> 00:43:52,183
"Can you spy him, deep within?"

153
00:43:52,267 --> 00:43:55,599
"Little Possum, black as sin."

154
00:43:58,975 --> 00:44:01,099
"Bag is open, growing wider."

155
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:03,683
"What's inside it,

156
00:44:04,431 --> 00:44:06,807
man or spider?"

157
00:44:08,055 --> 00:44:10,931
"Little boy, don't lose your way."

158
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:14,183
"Possum wants to come and play."

159
00:44:22,391 --> 00:44:26,639
- Where'd you get that?
- Fell. From there.

160
00:44:26,723 --> 00:44:28,475
Liar.

161
00:45:09,475 --> 00:45:12,015
Didn't know you could draw as well.

162
00:45:13,055 --> 00:45:14,391
Private.

163
00:45:15,475 --> 00:45:17,639
Is it dead yet?

164
00:45:19,723 --> 00:45:21,847
Mind your own business.

165
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:23,975
Perhaps it's still playin'.

166
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:32,599
- You won't see me again, Maurice.
- Won't I?

167
00:45:32,723 --> 00:45:34,807
Train line's down.

168
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:37,183
Home for the holidays, you are.

169
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:41,055
But I'd watch
where you're treadin', lad.

170
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:44,723
- People are talkin'.
- Talkin' about what?

171
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:47,347
Don't you read the papers?

172
00:45:57,975 --> 00:46:00,267
Why didn't you burn, Maurice, eh?

173
00:46:01,807 --> 00:46:02,975
Hmm?

174
00:46:04,807 --> 00:46:07,055
Why wasn't it you?

175
00:51:13,931 --> 00:51:15,307
Maurice?

176
00:51:32,267 --> 00:51:33,683
Maurice?

177
00:52:07,931 --> 00:52:14,099
Happy valley, painted black,
all the children in a sack.

178
00:52:14,183 --> 00:52:17,639
Wave goodbye to sun and moon.

179
00:52:17,723 --> 00:52:20,099
Say hello to black balloon.

180
00:55:00,307 --> 00:55:03,015
Happened before, I recall.

181
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:06,891
Your time. After the fire.

182
00:55:12,139 --> 00:55:13,847
Your school, wasn't it?

183
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:23,015
I taught you there once, remember?

184
00:55:24,267 --> 00:55:28,099
- I remember.
- That business with the fox...

185
00:55:29,307 --> 00:55:32,891
A colleague asked me in
to teach them all a lesson.

186
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:36,099
Remember their faces.

187
00:55:37,223 --> 00:55:38,847
We showed 'em, didn't we?

188
00:55:40,267 --> 00:55:42,307
Petrified, they were.

189
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:58,931
Stuffed 'em inside a bag, didn't he?

190
00:57:00,139 --> 00:57:03,307
Wore a mask so they couldn't see him.

191
00:57:05,223 --> 00:57:06,683
There, there, lad.

192
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:08,475
I had no idea.

193
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:16,807
I'm sorry. Here.

194
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:34,099
I had no idea.

195
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

196
01:03:05,683 --> 01:03:07,347
Maurice?

197
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:40,391
Police are widening their search

198
01:03:40,475 --> 01:03:42,139
for missing teenager Michael Browning

199
01:03:42,223 --> 01:03:45,599
who disappeared on his way home
from school on Tuesday afternoon.

200
01:03:45,683 --> 01:03:49,015
Officers are investigating reports
of a man acting suspiciously

201
01:03:49,099 --> 01:03:52,475
near woodlands and waste ground,
close to a former military barracks

202
01:03:52,555 --> 01:03:54,639
in the area of Fullmarsh.

203
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:57,807
The suspect,
who was wearing a beige raincoat,

204
01:03:57,891 --> 01:04:02,099
was seen several times with a boy
matching Michael's description.

205
01:04:02,183 --> 01:04:05,515
Police are warning members of the public
not to approach the man,

206
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,639
and urge anyone with information
to contact the police on this number...

207
01:05:46,807 --> 01:05:48,807
What are you lookin' for?

208
01:05:57,515 --> 01:05:59,683
I wanna talk to you.

209
01:06:12,807 --> 01:06:14,975
Come.

210
01:06:22,015 --> 01:06:24,183
Someone come 'ere for you.

211
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:27,015
Who?

212
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:29,347
Law, I reckon.

213
01:06:29,847 --> 01:06:33,347
- What did they want?
- None of my business.

214
01:06:33,431 --> 01:06:35,015
Said you were out.

215
01:06:37,055 --> 01:06:38,847
Did you find him?

216
01:06:39,807 --> 01:06:42,975
- Who?
- Who you're lookin' for.

217
01:06:45,723 --> 01:06:50,347
- No.
- He'll turn up. They always do.

218
01:06:51,723 --> 01:06:53,015
We burnt it.

219
01:06:53,975 --> 01:06:56,599
You and me, we burnt it, the puppet.

220
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:58,391
You look confused, lad.

221
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:00,767
You don't look well.

222
01:07:01,723 --> 01:07:02,975
Your face.

223
01:07:04,683 --> 01:07:07,683
Maybe you best lie low for a while.

224
01:07:12,391 --> 01:07:13,891
I'm goin' away.

225
01:07:16,183 --> 01:07:17,931
Where you goin'?

226
01:07:18,015 --> 01:07:19,807
My business.

227
01:07:21,847 --> 01:07:24,183
You'll have this place to yourself.

228
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:26,767
Don't bring trouble home.

229
01:07:30,391 --> 01:07:32,307
Bloody kids.

230
01:08:37,099 --> 01:08:38,599
Wait there, please.

231
01:08:41,639 --> 01:08:45,183
Can I see him then, please, miss?
Will I... Will I see him, Mr Grant?

232
01:08:45,267 --> 01:08:47,139
He's my form teacher.

233
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:49,347
He knows all about it.
He knows what's happened.

234
01:08:49,431 --> 01:08:51,099
Said he'd come with me.

235
01:08:51,975 --> 01:08:55,347
- Come where?
- Police station, miss.

236
01:08:56,347 --> 01:08:57,807
Wait there, please.

237
01:09:32,139 --> 01:09:36,099
OK, will you call them?
And I'll keep him here.

01:15:42,723 --> 01:15:46,391
The parcel opened,
out it sprang,

240
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:49,807
the black long-legged Possum man.

241
01:15:49,891 --> 01:15:55,183
Children, run! He'll eat and smother
any child without a mother.

242
01:15:57,015 --> 01:15:58,599
Maurice!

243
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:01,767
Maurice!

244
01:16:05,639 --> 01:16:07,515

01:16:15,807 --> 01:16:18,391

- No. No, no, no.
- Poor boy.

253
01:19:59,639 --> 01:20:01,475
Poor orphan boy.

- No.

255
01:20:06,223 --> 01:20:11,515
There, there. Uncle's here, lad.

Have you missed them?

01:20:26,391 --> 01:20:31,223
Please... Please, Uncle Maurice, don't.
Please, don't.

262
01:20:31,307 --> 01:20:34,223
Do you want my fingers,

01:20:35,723 --> 01:20:36,975

Open up, I said!

Poor, broken Philip.
