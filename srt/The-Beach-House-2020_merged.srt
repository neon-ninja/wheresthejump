2
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:58,890
He's still working on it.

3
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,762
Never seems to finish.

4
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:13,862
No one's been here
in months.

5
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:17,039
Season doesn't really start
until Memorial Day.

6
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:27,876
Looks like we have the whole
neighborhood to ourselves.

7
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:39,496
Hey...

8
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:46,677
I've been thinking about this,
like, you have no idea.

9
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:03,477
I missed you.

10
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:18,927
So, uh, what do you
want to do?

11
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:06,888
Where are you going?

12
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:10,152
I'm just going to run
to the restroom.

13
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,720
I'll be back in a sec.

14
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:20,989
You know, it's not bad here in,
like, January, February.

15
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,730
Yeah?

16
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,516
Well...

17
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:28,300
I was thinking that maybe we
could live here,

18
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,693
like year-round.

19
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:33,088
I mean, the house is just
sitting here empty.

20
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:35,873
It's such a waste.

21
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:40,835
Well, what about
my grad school?

22
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:42,619
Can't that wait?

23
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,623
I mean, that's, like years.

24
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,843
I mean, it's such bullshit.

25
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:51,846
You know it is.

26
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:54,414
No, not really.

27
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:56,633
Think about it.

28
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,593
It'd be a vacation all the time.

29
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,595
Isn't that what we want?

30
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,166
Don't be scared.

31
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,573
Randall, get up.

32
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,835
Someone's here.

33
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:21,490
- What?
- Someone's in the house.

34
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:23,274
Well, that's impossible.

35
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:25,668
- No one should be here.
- Well, they're downstairs.

36
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,757
- Get dressed.
- Who is it?

37
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:29,977
I don't know. Some woman.

38
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:32,283
Perfect.

39
00:10:57,874 --> 00:11:00,355
She was right there.

40
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:04,533
Hello?

41
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,795
Jesus!

42
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,623
Who are you?

43
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,364
What are you doing
in my house?

44
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,846
Your house?

45
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:16,284
Doc never said anyone
was gonna be here.

46
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:18,242
You spoke to my father?

47
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:21,419
You're Randy?

48
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:25,685
Oh, you got so big.

49
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:28,644
I haven't seen you since...

50
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:30,777
Mm...

51
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:32,300
It's been years.

52
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:35,129
We stayed here
with your family.

53
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,219
Jane, honey,
sorry I took so long.

54
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:41,918
The nearest open store
is an hour away.

55
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,705
Well...

56
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,316
It's Randy.

57
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:50,231
Doc's son.

58
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:53,800
Is that right?

59
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,802
Well, Randall now.

60
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,804
Well, Randall.

61
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,196
Mitch Turner.

62
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,547
You've met my wife Jane.

63
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:03,897
It's good to see you.

64
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:07,291
I taught with Doc
at Brighton High,

65
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:09,424
maybe, uh, 20 years ago.

66
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,079
And you are?

67
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,124
Uh, sorry, I'm Emily.
Emily Kirk.

68
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:15,691
I'm Randall's girlfriend.

69
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:17,911
Oh, it's very nice
to meet you.

70
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:19,390
Nice to meet you.
I'm so sorry about this.

71
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:20,827
We don't want
to ruin your weekend.

72
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:22,916
We can, uh,
go to a hotel, or...

73
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:24,221
We don't want to impose
or anything.

74
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,049
No, we're only in one bedroom.

75
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:28,443
There's plenty of space.

76
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,186
It'd be so great to have
dinner with you tonight.

77
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:35,624
I'm kind of a grill master,
at least Jane says so.

78
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,757
He is.

79
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,193
Yeah, sure.

80
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,282
That sounds good.

81
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,066
Thank you. Uh...

82
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:45,547
Randall, I'm gonna go
get the bags...

83
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:46,722
Okay.

84
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,115
...from the car.

85
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:50,944
I'll be there
in a minute.

86
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:53,294
Excuse me.

87
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:26,414
So who are they?

88
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:30,200
Some old friends
of my father, it seems.

89
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:35,379
They obviously spoke to Doc
before coming here.

90
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:37,904
Did you happen to tell him
that we were gonna be here?

91
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:40,123
Things have been strained
between us lately.

92
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,821
It's not my fault.

93
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,825
Of course.

94
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,784
You know, I thought it would be
a good idea

95
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,830
to come here with you
and straighten some things out.

96
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,527
And now it's not?

97
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,268
I'm serious.

98
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,053
You know, I...

99
00:13:58,098 --> 00:13:59,926
I thought we were good.

100
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:02,276
And then you leave school,

101
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:04,278
you leave me.

102
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:07,194
No calls,
some cryptic emails.

103
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,152
I mean, are you kidding me?

104
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:12,895
And now, here we are,
back at it again

105
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,897
like nothing's changed.

106
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,553
And we could have gone
somewhere else.

107
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,294
We could have gone anywhere.

108
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:21,861
Emily...

109
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,865
I fucked up.

110
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:28,650
I wanted to be here with you,
that's all.

111
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:30,260
So they're here.

112
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,134
We'll figure it out.

113
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:35,483
We have time.

114
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,138
I promise.

115
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:41,097
It'll be fine, okay?

116
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:43,578
Okay.

117
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,582
I do love you, you know.

118
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,499
I love you, too.

119
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:22,182
And here comes
this three-year-old kid

120
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,358
who wouldn't eat
anything we made,

121
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:27,361
just scarfing down
these oysters.

122
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:30,364
I think I puked
my brains out.

123
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,540
You liked them.

124
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:35,195
No oysters tonight?

125
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:38,459
Fine.

126
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:40,635
For old times' sake.

127
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:50,906
Yeah, um...

128
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,517
I think I liked them more
when I didn't know any better.

129
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,870
I'm not even going
to attempt that.

130
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,698
Mm-mmm, not for me.

131
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:02,396
It's an acquired taste.

132
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:07,401
Yeah. My idea of the beach
is a book and a blanket.

133
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:09,316
Not shellfish.

134
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,144
What are you studying
at school, Emily?

135
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:13,320
Organic chemistry.
I'm finishing up my third year.

136
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,017
Five more weeks.

137
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:16,932
Chemistry? That's...
That's an ambitious major.

138
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,326
Yeah, yeah. I, um...

139
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,328
I did it as a bit
of a challenge to myself.

140
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:26,594
I figured I could study anything
after four years of chemistry.

141
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:28,639
- You thinking about grad school?
- Yeah.

142
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:32,078
I want to study astrobiology
at the University of Washington.

143
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:34,080
They have a great program.

144
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,430
What is that?
Life on other planets?

145
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,258
Kind of.

146
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:41,130
It actually has more to do
with life on this planet.

147
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:45,134
How organisms can adapt
to extreme environments

148
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:47,702
that we could not even survive.

149
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,312
It's, um...

150
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,793
It's the point where chemistry
becomes biology.

151
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,535
Somewhere at the bottom
of the ocean, we think.

152
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:02,108
Life is so fragile.

153
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:06,112
We're the right
combination of elements.

154
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,464
The right temperature.
The right distance from the sun.

155
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:15,121
And this measure of time
spent developing

156
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,514
and changing.

157
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,473
Billions of years.

158
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,130
One thing slightly off,
and we would be nothing.

159
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:27,089
Dust or gas or something.

160
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,007
I'm in awe of it.

161
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,970
Over my head.

162
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,148
Randall, how'd you end up
with someone so smart?

163
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,454
Lucky, I guess.

164
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,066
Randall, what are you
studying at college?

165
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:50,460
Um... Well,
I'm not really there now.

166
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:52,332
Oh, yeah?

167
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:54,595
Yeah. I just...

168
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:57,641
I'd had it with school.

169
00:17:57,728 --> 00:18:00,209
I needed to get away,
you know?

170
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:03,691
Doc probably wasn't
thrilled with that.

171
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:06,650
No.

172
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:08,348
No, he was not.

173
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:12,091
Things are a little
different now, with college.

174
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,353
Like, they're farming
graduates.

175
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,138
I didn't want
what school offered,

176
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:18,184
what the rest of my life
was gonna be.

177
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:22,623
I mean, it's like,
what am I learning?

178
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,278
What's the point
of an education?

179
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:27,193
Just to... to get a job?

180
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,456
I mean, there has to be
something else, right?

181
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,327
What's underneath
all of this?

182
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:33,895
The... The marriage, kids,

183
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:36,027
taxes, bills,
watching television,

184
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,378
elections, sports on Sunday.

185
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:41,511
Careful. I coached
a state champion baseball team.

186
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,905
Look, no offense.

187
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,907
I just don't know.

188
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:47,952
You know, I'm figuring it out.

189
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,215
For me.

190
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:51,042
Well, it's complicated.

191
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,566
I just wouldn't write off

192
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:55,873
everyone who thinks
differently than you do.

193
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,094
You should be thankful
that you have the time

194
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,617
to do whatever you want.

195
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,448
It...

196
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:10,149
It is nice to hear...

197
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:13,152
that spirit.

198
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:17,765
We are so fortunate
to be here with you.

199
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:19,549
It's just...

200
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:23,162
It's just so nice.

201
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,350
Well, uh,

202
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:38,786
does anyone need a refill?

203
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:40,614
Yes, please.

204
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,925
Uh-oh.

205
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:49,666
Bad news.

206
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:51,015
Are we out?

207
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:53,844
Last bottle of chardonnay.

208
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:55,281
Half-empty.

209
00:19:56,978 --> 00:20:00,416
Doc doesn't have any bottles
stashed away anywhere?

210
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:02,810
I could use a little whiskey.

211
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:04,290
No.

212
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:05,943
Nothing's open
this time of night.

213
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,424
Well, and we shouldn't
be driving anyway.

214
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,560
There is something else.

215
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:23,004
- Mr. Turner.
- "Mitch," please.

216
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,745
Mitch, Jane...

217
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:28,531
are you familiar
with edibles?

218
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:30,272
Randall...

219
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,231
Times being
what they are,

220
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,580
legalization and all.

221
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,190
I don't think
this is appropriate.

222
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,714
Well, it's only polite to share.

223
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:43,416
Edible marijuana?
Is that what you mean?

224
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:49,900
Are you fucking insane?

225
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:52,338
What? I got them at a
dispensary before I picked you up.

226
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:54,601
They even said that most
of the customers are, like,

227
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:56,037
50, 60 years old.

228
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:58,387
This is a really
bad idea, Randall.

229
00:20:58,474 --> 00:20:59,867
What's he gonna do,
tell my dad?

230
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:01,477
She's medicated.

231
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:03,523
It'll probably
do her some good.

232
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:06,352
I don't think it's a good idea.

233
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:07,875
You already ate.
We're not gonna be driving.

234
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:09,224
Okay.

235
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,357
How strong are they?

236
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,359
They'll be fine.

237
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:14,969
Randall?

238
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,539
Do we cut it in quarters?

239
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:35,163
So wait, tell me
about this astrobiology?

240
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,776
Well,
it's like the origins of life on Earth.

241
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:43,737
As we study the basic building
blocks of life on other planets,

242
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:46,696
it helps us
with our origins.

243
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:48,481
Finding any evidence of water
is a good start.

244
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,221
Didn't they just
find water on Mars?

245
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,137
Uh, yeah, kind of.

246
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:55,096
Very recently.

247
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:58,752
It's like, there are these
very basic elements

248
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:01,972
that were present at the
earliest stages of the planet,

249
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:05,628
and the heat from the from
the core of the earth,

250
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:08,283
it kept churning these elements

251
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,938
for millions and millions
of years.

252
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,202
Evaporating, hardening...

253
00:22:18,728 --> 00:22:20,774
The atmosphere is, like,

254
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:24,343
steam from water
hitting a hot rock.

255
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,040
But it's like

256
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:29,957
something foreign had to enter
the environment

257
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:32,307
for nucleic acids to form.

258
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:35,354
That initial drop,

259
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:37,399
where did it come from?

260
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:40,924
And then it started reacting,
replicating,

261
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:45,189
into what would become
the bottom of the ocean.

262
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:01,467
Soft water.

263
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:09,910
I'm getting my diver's
certification,

264
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:13,392
so I can go on
deep-sea studies...

265
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:18,092
in some of the most inhospitable
places on the planet.

266
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,791
If we can find organisms

267
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:24,620
that could live in such
harsh conditions here, then...

268
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:27,884
Oh, like an alien planet.

269
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:30,887
I mean...

270
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:34,108
I guess.

271
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:39,940
All other planets are too harsh
for life as we know it.

272
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:43,422
We are the exception.

273
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:46,468
We're delicate.

274
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:53,170
What would it
have looked like?

275
00:23:53,257 --> 00:23:54,476
What?

276
00:23:54,563 --> 00:23:56,260
Our planet.

277
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:58,437
The surface back then.

278
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:01,788
I don't know.

279
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:09,622
Swirling gases.

280
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,322
Unstable.

281
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:15,889
Boiling.

282
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:19,240
Chaos.

283
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:20,850
Hm.

284
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:46,457
It's so beautiful.

285
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,290
Randall, have you
seen this out here before?

286
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:54,901
No way.

287
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:58,165
Super trippy.

288
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:08,654
It's all over.

289
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:10,873
It's in the trees.

290
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:18,185
Windswept microbes of some kind.

291
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:22,015
Something in the air.

292
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:25,366
Usually it's in
the water.

293
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:28,064
Oh, I want to see.

294
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,893
You think you should?

295
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,288
Oh, please, Mitchell.
I'm fine.

296
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,290
I'm having such a good time.

297
00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:38,161
Fine, fine.

298
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:46,822
I think I need
a new song.

299
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:54,613
Mm. I'm sorry,
I should have asked.

300
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:59,226
With all your science...

301
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:00,444
I know.

302
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:01,663
I know it's stupid.

303
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,056
I'll say.

304
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,103
Randall hates it, too.

305
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:11,194
I want to be a scientist,

306
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:14,676
but I still do dumb shit.

307
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:32,868
You okay, Mrs. Turner?

308
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:34,261
Hmm?

309
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:35,654
You feeling it?

310
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:39,266
Oh, I'm just having
so much fun.

311
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,445
That music sounded alive.

312
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:46,360
Yeah?

313
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:47,796
That's awesome.

314
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:54,020
It's gonna be
amazing outside.

315
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:07,686
You kids today,
how you see the world.

316
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:10,689
It's so different.

317
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:15,215
All the information
out there, it's...

318
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:18,305
scary.

319
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:20,699
No, don't...
Don't be scared. It...

320
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:24,050
The doors that could be open

321
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:27,053
because of that
information should...

322
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:31,666
It should make life
more beautiful.

323
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:36,932
We're learning
so much so fast.

324
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:41,937
I think that's why
I put my head down

325
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:44,679
and focus on our
baseball team.

326
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:50,250
It kind of smells
out here.

327
00:28:51,468 --> 00:28:52,818
You smell that?

328
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:56,909
Yeah, I do.

329
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,869
I wonder if sewage
is backed up.

330
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:05,221
I felt a little
light-headed before.

331
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:10,879
Have you seen my wife?

332
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:14,056
Um...

333
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:20,193
No, I haven't.

334
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,325
She... She's very...

335
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:27,504
I h... I have to look out
for her.

336
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:28,723
Yeah.

337
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,290
I really...

338
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:32,379
I really shouldn't have
let her do this.

339
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,620
Mitchell?

340
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,411
Randall, get up.

341
00:30:48,498 --> 00:30:50,152
What? It's fine.

342
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:52,024
It's not fine.
Turn the music down.

343
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:54,678
Randall, where did Jane go?

344
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:56,550
Uh... Outside, I think?

345
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:57,899
I need to find her.

346
00:30:57,986 --> 00:31:00,162
She went out the front door.

347
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:05,602
Jane!

348
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:07,300
It smells.

349
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,611
That stuff's really strong.

350
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,865
I think they're really
fucked up.

351
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:52,606
Who?

352
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:53,955
Who do you think?

353
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,095
This fog is insane.

354
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:20,460
You smell that?

355
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:23,463
What?

356
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,954
I'm seeing sunspots.

357
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:38,652
Jane!

358
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,306
Relax.

359
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:41,655
Jesus.

360
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:43,135
Jane?

361
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:47,313
Jane?

362
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,144
Randall?

363
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:55,625
What are you doing?

364
00:32:57,932 --> 00:32:59,542
I don't...

365
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:04,199
I don't feel good.

366
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:04,477
Randall?

367
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:05,913
Hm?

368
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:07,573
Randall...

369
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,097
Hey, get up. It's past noon.

370
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:14,232
How are you feeling?

371
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:16,146
I'm fine.

372
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,542
I feel like
I'm still stoned.

373
00:37:22,718 --> 00:37:25,504
I have this horrible
taste in my mouth.

374
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:29,290
Is it hot out?

375
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:30,726
I'm sweating.

376
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:32,598
Yeah, it's hot out.

377
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:36,819
It's beautiful, though.

378
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,519
The fog's gone away.

379
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:45,480
Should we go to the beach?

380
00:37:49,658 --> 00:37:53,183
Okay, I'm still a little
fucked up.

381
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,450
Yeah.

382
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:02,062
They were a mess.

383
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:03,455
Really?

384
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:04,630
Yeah.

385
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:07,285
She was throwing up.

386
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,766
And you fell asleep.

387
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:12,812
I didn't think
they'd get so messed up.

388
00:38:14,466 --> 00:38:16,598
I thought they'd enjoy it.

389
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:18,165
Really.

390
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:22,865
Well, I'm... I'm glad
I brought my suit.

391
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,357
Mrs. Turner,
how are you today?

392
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:46,759
Um...

393
00:38:46,846 --> 00:38:48,717
You want some coffee?

394
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:54,854
Are you okay?

395
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:04,385
Do you need
your medication?

396
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:09,738
Your pills.

397
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,363
Mrs. Turner,
where's Mr. Turner?

398
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:30,368
Where's Mitch?

399
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:36,504
Mitch?

400
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,165
Um, here, let me...

401
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:46,558
Let me help you.

402
00:40:06,142 --> 00:40:07,622
Hello, Mrs. Turner.

403
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:17,589
Um...

404
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:41,700
Mitch!

405
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:45,094
Mr. Turner!

406
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:58,847
Let's go down.

407
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,652
I don't think
he's down here.

408
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:23,524
No one is.

409
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:27,920
Mitch!

410
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:32,620
Mr. Turner!

411
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:37,364
Mitch!

412
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,516
Why would he leave her?

413
00:41:58,603 --> 00:42:00,518
Seems fucking shitty.

414
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:04,739
I'm sure he's somewhere close.

415
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,357
Can we sit down
for a second?

416
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:15,576
You okay?

417
00:42:15,663 --> 00:42:17,622
Yeah.

418
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:21,147
It's just hot.

419
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:22,975
And the air is so thick.

420
00:42:39,034 --> 00:42:40,993
Maybe he went swimming
somewhere.

421
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:40,313
You all right?

422
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,271
Yeah, I'm gonna go
back to the house.

423
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:44,099
- Yeah?
- Yeah, like right now.

424
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:46,058
- Well, I'll come with you.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

425
00:43:46,145 --> 00:43:48,277
I got to use the bathroom.
It's a guy thing.

426
00:43:48,364 --> 00:43:51,237
- Will you check on Mrs. Turner?
- Yeah. Sure.

427
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:54,719
Are you sure
you're okay?

428
00:43:54,806 --> 00:43:56,634
Yeah, I'll be right back.

429
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:49,687
Where is everyone?

430
00:44:52,646 --> 00:44:54,213
I've been wondering that.

431
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:02,308
It was always so beautiful here,
but this time...

432
00:45:04,092 --> 00:45:05,485
I don't know.

433
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:07,574
Something is off.

434
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:20,761
Oh, come on, now.

435
00:45:34,688 --> 00:45:36,211
What the fuck?

436
00:45:49,355 --> 00:45:51,313
Mr. Turner?

437
00:45:57,102 --> 00:45:58,668
Mitch?

438
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:24,129
The thing we liked about coming
here is, it was so comfortable.

439
00:46:25,173 --> 00:46:28,568
The same weather,
the same rooms,

440
00:46:28,655 --> 00:46:30,483
the same furniture.

441
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,790
They're frozen in time.

442
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:38,404
Jane loved it so much.

443
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,931
We hadn't been in so long,
I just...

444
00:46:46,238 --> 00:46:49,807
I wanted her to have
one last special time.

445
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:55,900
She could be so happy
on the beach.

446
00:47:02,602 --> 00:47:05,779
And when you see
someone change

447
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:07,781
in front of you...

448
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:12,917
and you know it won't
get any better,

449
00:47:13,004 --> 00:47:14,832
there's no going back.

450
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:22,100
It scares me to death.

451
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:29,455
How is she?

452
00:47:35,026 --> 00:47:37,202
We are so fortunate.

453
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:42,120
It is so nice out today.

454
00:47:57,352 --> 00:47:59,050
Is everything okay?

455
00:48:00,703 --> 00:48:02,792
Fine, fine.

456
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:06,448
Everything is fine.

457
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:13,238
I think I'll go for a swim.

458
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:02,809
Mr. Turner?

459
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,932
Mitch!

460
00:49:52,337 --> 00:49:54,034
Mitch!

461
00:50:00,388 --> 00:50:01,868
Jane?

462
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:21,148
Are you okay?

463
00:50:30,853 --> 00:50:32,333
Mrs. Turner?

464
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:35,597
I'm coming inside.

465
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:39,340
Tell me if you don't want me to.

466
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:55,139
Mitch!

467
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:06,558
Randall!

468
00:52:57,348 --> 00:52:58,740
Randall!

469
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:37,518
Randall, where the fuck
are you?

470
00:56:18,549 --> 00:56:19,941
Randall?

471
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:24,163
Hey. Hey, stop.
What are you doing?

472
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,818
What's wrong with you? Hey.

473
00:56:33,085 --> 00:56:34,652
No, no.

474
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:57,239
Hey, we have to go.
We have to go, all right?

475
00:56:58,502 --> 00:57:00,286
Get up, get up, get up, get up.

476
00:57:34,973 --> 00:57:36,496
Where are your keys?

477
00:57:37,802 --> 00:57:39,281
- I don't have them.
- What do you mean?

478
00:57:39,368 --> 00:57:40,935
They're not here!

479
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:44,983
- God, what's wrong with her?
- Go! Just go!

480
00:57:49,988 --> 00:57:51,859
- This way.
- What?

481
00:57:51,946 --> 00:57:53,339
This way.

482
00:58:07,396 --> 00:58:09,442
Hello?

483
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,619
Hello? We need help!

484
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:14,969
Hello?

485
00:58:15,056 --> 00:58:16,362
I need a hospital.

486
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:21,367
Oh, I'm fucked up.

487
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,457
What is it?
Is it your stomach?

488
00:58:24,544 --> 00:58:26,415
No, it's everything.

489
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,861
What did she do to you?

490
00:58:38,427 --> 00:58:40,517
I tried to help her.

491
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:47,393
It's like I was knocked out.
I...

492
00:58:49,003 --> 00:58:50,701
I can't remember.

493
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,403
We need a car.

494
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,973
We need a car.
We need to get out of here.

495
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,975
We need help.

496
00:59:04,062 --> 00:59:05,324
What is going on?

497
00:59:06,978 --> 00:59:08,545
I don't know.

498
00:59:13,462 --> 00:59:15,029
- What is it?
- Oh, fuck!

499
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,561
I can't breathe.

500
01:00:18,266 --> 01:00:19,877
Look. Look.

501
01:00:19,964 --> 01:00:21,487
What is it?

502
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:24,664
A flashing light.

503
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:27,058
Somebody's gonna be there.

504
01:00:27,145 --> 01:00:28,625
They have to be.

505
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:33,194
We got to go.

506
01:00:56,261 --> 01:00:57,566
Okay.

507
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,941
Okay...

508
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,773
Hello?

509
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,252
Is this the police?

510
01:01:34,603 --> 01:01:36,823
Is there anybody there?
We need help.

511
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:45,049
We're... We're on Beach...

512
01:01:45,136 --> 01:01:46,790
Beachcomber Road.

513
01:01:46,877 --> 01:01:48,792
It's, um...
It's near the bend.

514
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:50,576
It's, uh... I don't...

515
01:01:50,663 --> 01:01:52,621
I don't know the address.

516
01:01:54,101 --> 01:01:56,190
...hear you... near the water?

517
01:01:56,277 --> 01:01:58,976
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
It's on the ocean.

518
01:01:59,063 --> 01:02:01,152
Your... Your car is here.

519
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:02,806
It's number, um...

520
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:05,547
Um, I don't know.
I don't know the number.

521
01:02:05,634 --> 01:02:07,419
I don't know the number,
but we need help.

522
01:02:08,942 --> 01:02:10,335
...are extremely dangerous...

523
01:02:10,422 --> 01:02:12,250
What's extremely dangerous?

524
01:02:13,555 --> 01:02:14,687
...exposed.

525
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:16,515
Everyone exposed.

526
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,954
Exposed to what?

527
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:22,956
Get out of the car,
get indoors, lock yourself in.

528
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:26,046
Seal the windows.
Don't breathe it.

529
01:02:26,133 --> 01:02:28,179
Breathe what?

530
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:30,050
Is it the fog?

531
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,706
It's not fog.

532
01:02:36,622 --> 01:02:38,145
What is it?

533
01:02:39,494 --> 01:02:41,235
What is it?

534
01:02:41,322 --> 01:02:42,933
Hello?

535
01:02:45,544 --> 01:02:47,285
Hello? Please answer.

536
01:02:49,461 --> 01:02:51,942
Hello?

537
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,076
Randall?

538
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:01,473
Randall!

539
01:03:07,653 --> 01:03:10,787
Randall. Are you okay?

540
01:03:14,355 --> 01:03:15,922
I was... I was thinking...

541
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,188
maybe it wasn't such a great
idea to come to the beach.

542
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,800
Can you get up?

543
01:03:44,342 --> 01:03:46,126
Help!

544
01:03:48,215 --> 01:03:50,435
Okay, I need you
to give me a second, okay?

545
01:03:50,522 --> 01:03:52,132
Just give me one second.

546
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hey.

547
01:04:42,226 --> 01:04:44,184
Jesus!

548
01:04:44,271 --> 01:04:45,403
Sorry.

549
01:04:47,274 --> 01:04:49,146
I'm feeling worse.
We need to get inside.

550
01:04:55,021 --> 01:04:56,980
I need you to cover your eyes,
okay?

551
01:04:57,067 --> 01:04:58,198
Shit.

552
01:05:10,819 --> 01:05:12,517
Can you get in?

553
01:05:12,604 --> 01:05:14,258
Okay, come on.

554
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:15,781
Come on.

555
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:21,091
One... two...

556
01:05:21,178 --> 01:05:22,483
three.

557
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:42,939
You okay?

558
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:46,029
I'm all right.

559
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:53,514
Are you okay?
Are you all right?

560
01:05:53,601 --> 01:05:56,343
Look at me. Look at me.

561
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:58,128
Are you okay?

562
01:06:13,665 --> 01:06:15,145
Hello?

563
01:06:20,498 --> 01:06:21,803
Em...

564
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,464
Come on.

565
01:06:40,866 --> 01:06:42,520
Well, that's a good thing.

566
01:06:44,783 --> 01:06:46,089
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

567
01:06:46,176 --> 01:06:47,351
Hold on.

568
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,367
Hello? Is anyone there?

569
01:07:04,237 --> 01:07:06,239
It smells like rotten eggs.

570
01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:17,337
What happened here?

571
01:07:32,178 --> 01:07:33,484
Nothing.

572
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:37,053
Damn it!

573
01:07:39,316 --> 01:07:41,448
Car keys. Car keys.
Car keys.

574
01:08:08,736 --> 01:08:10,086
They...

575
01:08:12,479 --> 01:08:15,178
They said it's not fog.
Maybe...

576
01:08:15,265 --> 01:08:18,398
Maybe it's something
from the water.

577
01:08:18,485 --> 01:08:20,183
An algae bloom.

578
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,794
A chemical spill
that's affecting the air.

579
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:24,274
I...

580
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:28,495
I don't know.

581
01:08:29,801 --> 01:08:31,455
We're fucked, right?

582
01:08:47,297 --> 01:08:49,081
Randall...

583
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:53,999
Okay...

584
01:08:55,392 --> 01:08:56,480
Okay...

585
01:08:59,657 --> 01:09:02,529
It's okay. It's okay.

586
01:09:02,616 --> 01:09:05,141
Here. Here.

587
01:09:18,328 --> 01:09:19,416
What?

588
01:09:19,503 --> 01:09:21,244
The television.

589
01:09:33,517 --> 01:09:34,474
Uh-uh.

590
01:09:36,998 --> 01:09:39,087
I can feel it, like...

591
01:09:40,654 --> 01:09:42,439
churning inside.

592
01:10:00,065 --> 01:10:02,023
It's all the same.

593
01:10:03,851 --> 01:10:06,071
We're in fucking hell.

594
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:13,644
The microbes
have been preserved in rock.

595
01:10:13,731 --> 01:10:15,167
- What is that?
- And the earth's heat

596
01:10:15,254 --> 01:10:16,908
free the bacterial form,

597
01:10:16,995 --> 01:10:18,214
- bubbling to the surface.
- It's a...

598
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:20,216
It's an AM station.

599
01:10:21,739 --> 01:10:23,480
Someone's out there.

600
01:10:23,567 --> 01:10:25,612
...Oceanographic
Research Institute,

601
01:10:25,699 --> 01:10:29,225
located 41 degrees north,
54 minutes, 67 seconds.

602
01:10:38,756 --> 01:10:40,192
We are fucked.

603
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:42,803
Well, if somebody's
broadcasting that,

604
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:44,022
that mean that
there are others.

605
01:10:44,109 --> 01:10:45,241
We should...

606
01:10:45,328 --> 01:10:46,633
We should lock ourselves in

607
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,156
and seal the windows,

608
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,507
and we could just
wait until morning.

609
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:54,728
I won't make that.

610
01:10:56,469 --> 01:10:57,775
No.

611
01:11:01,126 --> 01:11:03,607
I need you to hold on for me,
okay?

612
01:11:03,694 --> 01:11:05,652
I can't do this by myself.

613
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:08,394
I've...

614
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:11,615
I've wasted so much time
on shit.

615
01:11:15,009 --> 01:11:16,620
I'm scared.

616
01:11:20,188 --> 01:11:21,538
I'm so scared.

617
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:22,713
It's okay.

618
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:31,069
Look at me. Hey.

619
01:11:33,463 --> 01:11:36,248
We have to keep going.

620
01:11:40,383 --> 01:11:42,036
Oh, God.

621
01:11:43,603 --> 01:11:45,039
I'm here.

622
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,608
And I'm not leaving you.

623
01:11:53,004 --> 01:11:54,484
Don't be scared.

624
01:11:56,181 --> 01:11:58,096
Okay?

625
01:11:59,358 --> 01:12:01,665
I need you
to hold on for me.

626
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:05,103
I'll try.

627
01:12:38,571 --> 01:12:42,314
...don't expire
when they succumb to the affliction.

628
01:12:42,401 --> 01:12:44,229
While life does not resemble

629
01:12:44,316 --> 01:12:45,622
what we have come
to understand,

630
01:12:45,709 --> 01:12:47,972
a complex carbon-based form

631
01:12:48,059 --> 01:12:49,626
has become something else.

632
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:55,431
...until our planet becomes
like all others,

633
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:57,520
an extinction event

634
01:13:57,607 --> 01:13:59,957
to all current complex
forms of life.

635
01:16:14,787 --> 01:16:16,397
Randall?

636
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:23,579
We got to go now.
There's something down there.

637
01:16:51,955 --> 01:16:53,609
No!

638
01:20:17,551 --> 01:20:18,944
No!

639
01:21:20,136 --> 01:21:21,354
Ah!

640
01:24:29,107 --> 01:24:30,935
Don't be scared.

641
01:24:32,589 --> 01:24:34,156
Don't be scared.

642
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:37,115
Don't be scared.

643
01:24:38,595 --> 01:24:40,249
Don't be scared.

644
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,079
Don't be scared.

645
