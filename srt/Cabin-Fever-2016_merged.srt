00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,099
¶ But the more
it stays the same ¶

181
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:03,968
I'll race you to the island!

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,281
-Yeah.

196
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,284
Greasy Toby,
the guy with the OCD?

197
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:57,755
-Yeah. That and ADD.

198
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,457
He tried to kiss me.

199
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,095
-He did?

200
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,697
-Mm-hmm.

201
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,799
Two days ago.

202
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,701
It's weird, it's like..

203
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:12,770
...this family friend
I've had for 12 years.

204
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:17,008
Just...he put his hands on my
face and tongue down my throat

205
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,712
and it was, was gross.
It was just bad.

206
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:25,116
-What, was it...gross because
you'd known him for so long

207
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,785
or...because he's gross?

208
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:31,289
-Mm...it was definitely him.

209
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,291
[chuckles]

210
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,329
You know how, like,
sometimes you've known someone

211
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,565
a really long time

212
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,735
and you just wanna kiss 'em just
to see if they're a good kisser?

213
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,441
-Yeah.

214
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,646
-I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

215
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,828
-Where are you going?

216
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,964
-Swimming.

Janny, I'm coming up
on your seven.

223
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,973

Poof!

225
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,411
Aah! I think I just got
a team killed to save you guys.

226
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,213
It's all good, move it up!

Oh, no.

00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,520
-You shot me!

237
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:45,089
-No fucking way.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, man.

238
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,691
I am so sorry!

239
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,728

00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,063
-Okay, okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

-Ugh!
-Hey, stay back!

just stay there!

Please!

00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,518
Fuck.

00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,067
What, were you trying
to burn the whole place down?

Smokey the Clown?

00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,575
-You mean Smokey the Bear?

265
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,410
-Seriously though,
how old are you?

266
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:13,744
We can't leave you alone
for five minutes without

267

you burning the place down?

268
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:20,484
And he brought a gun. Great, so,
what were you shooting at?

269
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:23,421
-Squirrels.
I was shootin' some squirrels.

270
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:29,026
-Okay.
-What is wrong with him?

-<i> Video game</i>

-What are you gonna roast
on that thing?

273
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,612
-Squirrel, if we even get one.

274
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:48,713
-I'm a vegetarian.

276
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:56,988
-So, Paul, tell your story.

277
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,590
-No, no, man, it's..

278
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,159
It's too traumatic.
I don't want to talk about that.

279
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,694
-We like traumatic stories.

280
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,797
I mean, not about me,
but in general.

281
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,232
-Plus trauma bonds people

282
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,101
so you can totally
talk to us about it.

283
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,003
-Trauma bonds people
who experience it

284
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,170
not the people
that you tell the story --

285
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:16,040
-Just tell the story!
-Fine. Fine.

286
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,709
[laughing]

287
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:24,915
-We used to go to this
bowling alley

288
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,118
Lenny Meads Brighton Bowl,
you remember it?

289
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,687
-It was in Brighton, right?

290
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:33,257
-Yeah, that's why
it's called Brighton Bowl.

291
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,792
-Okay, guys.

292
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,994
-<i> Anyway, every weekend</i>
<i> I would go there either</i>

293
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:41,165
with my dad or for a birthday
party or whatever.

294
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,367
One weekend I asked my dad
if we were going?

295
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,703
He said, no.
He said the alley was closed.

296
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,841
Apparently,
some disgruntled employee

297
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:55,146
was holding all the other
employees at gunpoint.

298
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,415
<i> The police said that he tied</i>
<i> each hostage</i>

299
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:01,285
to a chair and arranged them
in a circle.

300
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:05,356
That way everyone was forced
to look at one another.

301
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,425
Then after that they've been
gagged and beaten

302
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,827
this maniac breaks out
a ball-peen hammer

303
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,929
and one by one..

304
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,000
<i> ...smashes in the back</i>

306
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:22,106
-Can you imagine
dying like that?

307
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,308
Just watching
all of your friends dying

308
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,743
knowing you're next?

309
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:26,977
-I can't.

310
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,080
-That's not all.

311
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:31,182
This guy doesn't stop,
he breaks out the fire axe.

312
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,751
The alarm sounds,
but he doesn't care.

313
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,219
He hacks off
all of their limbs

314
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,288
dismembers them completely.

315
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,156
When the police arrived

316
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,392
they just found
6 bloody torsos

317
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:44,061
tied to those colored
bowling chairs, remember?

318
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:47,098
Blood everywhere.

319
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,266
No sign of the killer though.

320
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:54,205
-And that was your childhood
playground?

321
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:58,843
-Yeah.

322
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,611
-True story.

323
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:06,684
-Oh, my God, you were lying?

-No, it's true..
You can look it up.
-You fuckers.
-It's not a funny story.
It's Jeff's face
that's making me laugh.
[gasps]
Shit!

325
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:17,495
-Where the fuck
did you come from?

326
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,532
-You spyin' on us?
-No, not at all.

327
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:25,169
Just saw your campfire.

328
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:29,106
I was out on a midnight hike, I
thought I'd come and say hello.

329
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,142
I haven't seen
anybody up here in a week.

330
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:32,710
-Um, can you do
something about--

331
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:35,946
-Dr. Mambo.
His name is Dr. Mambo.

332
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,481
At least that's what I call.

333
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:38,616
He seems to like it.

334
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:42,453
-Psychiatrist or pediatrician?

335
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:44,288
-Little of both, I guess.

336
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,424
-What are you doing out here?

337
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,926
-Same thing you guys are.

338
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,362
Enjoying nature.

339
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:54,498
Some of the best free climbing
is right here in this valley.

340
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,700
-I hate heights.

341
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:59,270
-It's definitely
not for everybody.

342
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,605
So you don't mind if I sit here
and chill out with you guys

343
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,873
for a bit, do you?

344
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,676
-Actually we're having
a private conversation

345
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,411
so if you don't mind..

346
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:10,614
-No worries.
I get it.

347
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,584
-I guess I'll just take
this big bag of weed

348
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,152
and smoke it all by myself.

349
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:18,022
-Oh, hey..
-No, no, no..

350
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:20,724
-Are you sure?
-Hey, no..

351
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:22,993
-I'm so sorry.
What's your name?

352
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:26,330
-Connor.
But you can call me Grim.

353
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,965
-Grim like, uh, Grimace or..

354
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:32,770
-No...just Grim.

355
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,808
Like that..

356
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,777
Like the Grim Reaper.

357
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:43,814
I figure I'm gonna die up
in these mountains anyway

358
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:48,519
so...I don't know..

359
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:51,288
Just a nickname.
I didn't beg it.

360
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:02,366
I just came up here
from Berkeley.

361
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:06,003
Now that's a party town.

362
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,306
-Karen was just there.
-Oh, yeah?

363
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,309
-Yeah.

364
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:15,145
Oh, my gosh,
I met these guys in..

365
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,714
<i> They won't let me drink</i>
<i> anything but beer</i>

366
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:19,550
<i> for, like, 5 days.</i>
<i> Just solid.</i>

367
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,253
-I've done that.

368
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:25,389
I got drunk.

369
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:27,725
-Actually, it sounds
like a pretty cool idea.

370
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,994
Only drinking beer.
-I could do it.

371
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,796
I don't know if you could.

372
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:35,666
-If that is a challenge, sir,
then I accept.

373
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:38,669
-Alright, fine,
from here on out,
we'll only drink beer.

374
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:41,105
-Deal.

375
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,640
[thunder rumbling]

376
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:47,011
-Looks like rain
is headed our way.

377
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:49,146
It's gonna be a wet one.

378
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:53,250
-Yeah. Party's over.

379
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,488
-Why don't you, uh, come up
for a minute and hang out?

380
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:01,759
-That's cool, but, uh,
I gotta get back to my tent.

381
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:04,328
I left all my gear out
and if it gets wet

382
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,764
that $4000 destroyed.

383
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:09,800
-<i> How far is your campsite?</i>

384
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,869
-It's about 20 minutes
give or take

385
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,904
but, uh, I'm coming back.

386
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,739
-Can you bring the weed?

387
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,740
-Absolutely.

388
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,908
[thunder rumbling]

389
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,844
-Alright, Dr. Mambo.
Let's hit it.

390
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:28,719
[chuckling]

391
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:30,054
-That was pretty weird.

392
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:32,022
-He was okay.

393
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:34,692
[thunder rumbling]

394
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:38,629
-So how did you do it?

395
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:41,298
[chuckles]

396
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,233
-What do you mean how?

397
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:47,071
It.. It was..

398
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:50,007
Okay, had different settings

399
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:55,212
like, pulse, power, stream

400
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:58,582
all different kinds of speeds
and, uh..

401
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:02,086
that was on this length of hose
that I could reach
when I lay down in the tub.

402
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,121
[Karen laughs]

403
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,390
-Wait, did you come
every time?

404
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:11,462
-Absolutely. Yeah.

405
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,530
Imagine my disappointment
the first time I had sex.

406
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:15,232
[laughs]

407
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,301
-Tell me about it.

408
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:20,137
-What's that supposed to mean?

409
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,271
-Wait, I have a better story.

410
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,641
-Bullshit, you do.

411
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:24,808
-Nothing beats stories
about Karen

412
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,876
and her parents shower massage.

413
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:26,877
-Thank you.

414
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:27,878
[knocking on door]

415
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,648
-Oh, it must be the weed guy.

416
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,750
Okay. Alright.

417
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:34,018

-I'm burnin'.

420
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,997
Help me.

421
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:49,900
I need a doctor.

422
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:52,036
-Uh, g -- get him a blanket.

423
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:53,737
-Oh, shit!

-You..

425
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,076
It's you.

426
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:00,511
-No, no, no, no, no.

427
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:03,514
No, no, no, no way

428
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,183
I'm letting that
contagious freak in.

429
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,519
-No, no, Bert, he's sick
and he needs help, okay?

430
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,754
-What? No, look at him.

431
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,890
I mean he's got something.
He's got something bad.

432
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:15,592
-But we need to call him
a doctor or call someone.

433
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,629
-Okay, no, no, no,
we don't have any receptions.

434
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:21,331
-Oh, shit, that freak
is going to the car.

435
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,533
-What?

436
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,567
-<i> Oh, wait, what?</i>
<i> What's he doing? What?</i>

437

Look at me!
Look at the guy with the gun.

Hey, get out of the car.

stay back!

I don't want him to touch me.

465
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,973
I don't want him to touch
any of us.

466
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,478
It was self-defense.

467
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,917
And it's raining,
so it probably put him out.

468
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,624
-This is some
serious real shit.

469
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:31,028
They are worse.

470
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,164
I mean, it looked like something
was eating his skin..

471
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,666
...like biohazard style.

472
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:39,203
Like quarantine.

473
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:41,171
-I think we should tell
the police it wasn't our fault.

474
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:46,476
We should tell them...now.

475
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,779
<i> We have -- we have to go</i>
<i> tell them right now. Please.</i>

476
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:52,583
-That's where the reality
comes in. We can't.

477
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:53,884
I'm not about to ride
in that car

478
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,252
with that dude's blood
all over it.

<i> Come on.</i>

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,027
Tomorrow we can clean it up,
fix the tire

481
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:08,765
whatever else is wrong with it,
and report the accident.

Holy shit.

486
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,056
-What's the plan?

487
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,760
-Divide and conquer.

488
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:13,263
-You better leave me
the rifle.

489
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,633
-He's right.

490
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:18,902
-What? Wait a second.

491
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:21,638
I'm not the one who went
ballistic last night.

492
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,106
-What's that supposed to mean?

493
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,143
-It means you raged
out of control, that's what.

494
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:27,577
-Well, that's fucked up.

495
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,446
-What was fucked up is you
beating the shit out of my car

496
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,014
with your fuckin' bat.

497
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,282
-What about Captain Jackoff
over here

498
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,684
with the assault rifle,
you forget about him?

499
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:36,420
-Alright, look,
we all fucked up the car.

500
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:39,957
-You guys are just gonna keep
arguing or maybe do somethin'
about it.

501
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:43,660
-Where you goin'?
-To get help.

-Jeff and Bert have --
-I know.

508
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,450
-I know you know it.

509
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:14,918
Look, last night, we --

510
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,355
-Paul, somebody came
to our door and asked for help

511
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:20,857
and we lit him on fire...okay.

512
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:23,293
He could be anywhere out there,
and I just wanna go home.

-Karen, it wasn't our fault.

514
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:28,131
We didn't mean to do it.
Everything happened so fast.

515
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,132
It was an accident.

516
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,768
-Was it?

517
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,539
I don't know about you,
but every time I close my eyes

518
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:38,108
I see him burning,
I can see him screaming

519
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:42,079
and his skin crackling and
the smell of his burning hair.

520
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,847
-We saw him when he came
on the door last night.

521
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,583
He was very sick.
He was going to die anyway.

522
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,351
-You don't know that.
Oh, my God.

523
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,922
-Look..

524
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:56,593
Look, I can't change
what happened last night.

525
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,896
I wish I could, but I can't.

526
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,668
But if we just work together
we can fix this.

527
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,239
Okay?

528
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:11,975
-Okay.
-Alright then.

529
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,980
Better?

00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:18,782
-Yeah.

00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:29,793
Thank you.
-Okay.

532
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,048
-I feel like, we're gonna get
lost.

533
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,617
-We're not gonna get lost.

534
00:35:59,091 --> 00:36:02,092
[music continues]

535
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:14,471
That place
just gotta have a phone.

536
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,441
-Uh, yeah..

537
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,776
<i> It looks kinda creepy.</i>

538
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:23,647
-Don't be a wuss.
Let's go check it out.

539
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:26,650
[howling]

540
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:29,119

[woman grunting]

542
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:56,346
-God damn, rot!

543
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:02,052
You see this?

544
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,254
You see this shit?

545
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:08,425
This is the third sick hog
this month.

546
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:12,062
You tell Marie I can't eat this!

547
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,198
There's some goddamn animal
runnin' around here

548
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,800
infecting everything.

549
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:20,937
Now what am I supposed
to do with a sick hog, huh?

550
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,172
Huh?

551
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:25,008
I'm not about to eat this meat.
Would you?

552
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,445
-N -- no.
No, I -- I -- I'm a vegetarian.

553
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:30,547
-That has nothin'
to do with it

554
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:34,484
because you know
all this stuff is no good.

555
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:38,188
It's all sick.
It all has to go back.

556
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:43,360
I want me a new hog.

557
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:45,929
-Yeah, um,
we just need a mechanic

558
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:46,930
and we're just wondering --

559
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,532
-A mechanic?

560
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:50,867
You're not gonna find one here

561
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,369
you got to go into town
for that.

562
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:54,838
-Uh, yeah, right.

563
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,841
That -- that's the, um, ahem,
the problem.

564
00:37:57,843 --> 00:38:01,011
Our car is busted,
so we can't get into town.

565
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:02,445
We need someone
to take us to town

566
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,381
<i> to get a mechanic.</i>

567
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:07,917
-I already been in town
already today. Sorry.

568
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:13,123
-Uh, well, if you're going to
town again, can you let us know?

569
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,959
We're just stayin' at a cabin
a few miles down the road.

570
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,161
[intense music]

571
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:23,233
-I'm sorry.

572
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:26,336
Of course, of course.

573
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:30,206
Heck, why didn't you just come
right out with it?

574
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:33,176
Here I am pracklin' on
about my hog

575
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:37,814
and you just wanna find somebody
who's gonna find you a mechanic.

576
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,617
Come on up to the house.
I got a radio inside.

577
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,887
We'll call Ricky.
Uh, he's got a tow truck.

578
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:46,656
-That's actually great.
-Yeah, great.

579
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,958
-Thank you. Ricky.

580
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,831
[thunder rumbling]

581
00:38:57,102 --> 00:39:00,570
Sorry to bother you,
but we really appreciate this.

582
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:03,039
<i> Some crazy guy came out</i>
<i> of the woods</i>

583
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:06,676
just tryin' to trash our car
or break into it or somethin'.

584
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,178
-Sounds terrible.

585
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,913
Uh, you two wanted
somethin' to drink?

586
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:13,316
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, please, thank you.

587
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:17,053
-Uh, you said this person
damaged your car?

588
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:19,622
-Yeah, it was this crazy
hermit guy, like, really
dangerous.

589
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:22,459
We just scared him off with bats
and everythin'.

590
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:25,028
-Crazy hermit guy?
I --it wasn't Henry, was it?

591
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:29,132
[music continues]

592
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:32,602
-Um, Henry..
-No.

593
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:36,639
Uh, my Cousin Henry.
Uh, he knows better than that.

594
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,942
Did you say
you hit him with bats?

595
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:40,377
-No.
-No.

596
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:41,845
-No, no, no.
-No, no, no.

597
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:43,346
What he means is, uh, no.

598
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:46,549
It wasn't Henry,
it was our friend, Walter.

599
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,817
-It was Walter.
-<i> Our friend, Walter.</i>

600
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:50,086
This crazy friend Walter.
He's.. He was drunk.

601
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,788
-Oh, that's not good.

602
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,391
-Uh, y -- you know what?
Let's forget the tow truck.

603
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,292
It's turning into such a nice
day. We'll just walk.

604
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:57,961
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
we'll fix ourselves.

605
00:39:57,963 --> 00:39:59,763
-Yeah.
-A -- are you sure?

606
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:01,698
-Yeah, absolutely.
Thank you so much.

607
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,932
-Thank you, really.

608
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:05,568
-Well, uh, suit yourselves,
I -- I..

609
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:10,807
-I can't believe
we burned Cousin Henry.

610
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,308
-I know.

611
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,181

00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

[exhales sharply]

614
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,311
-Fuck. Did you find anybody?

615
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,749
-Nothing. Nobody's home.

616
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:55,385
-Place is locked up
pretty tight.

617
00:40:57,923 --> 00:41:00,290
-Do you think the police
know about this yet?

618
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,459
-I doubt it.

619
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,394
If they did, they'd be
at the cabin already.

620
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
-Whoa, whoa! Easy, easy.

621
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:31,521
-Town boy, that's how people
get themselves shot around here.

622
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:39,963
-Deputy Winston, Bunyan County
Sheriff's Department.

623
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:41,498
-What can I do for you?

624
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,033
-I'm just out here on patrol.

625
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,969
It's my jurisdiction.

626
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:49,072
I understand you guys
had a little commotion here
last night.

627
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:51,841
I was hopin' you could tell me
somethin' about that.

628
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:55,979
-Sure, sure. Uh, some...guy
tried to enter our cabin.

629
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:58,515
Uh, he was sick, really sick.

630
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,016
I don't know
what kind of disease he had

631
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,218
but he was a mess, and..

632
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:06,823
-Yeah. Ahem.
I kinda have to report this.

633
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,027
-My friends are out lookin'
for a neighbor right now

634
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,863
so we could call you.
We don't have a phone up here.

635
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:17,066
-No, most people got radios.
That's what I've got.

636
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:25,375
It looks like you guys were
having some kinda party
last night, huh?

637
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,943
-Yeah, you know,
w-we were drinking

638
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:29,045
and then this guy came along
and tried to..

639
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,281
He tried to break
into our cabin, and, you know

640
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:32,749
uh, we had no choice,
but to get rough with him

641
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:33,750
and we didn't know what to do --

642
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,618
-Stop talkin'.
-Yes.

643
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,986
[chuckles]

644
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,088
-Look, man, I already told
you, makin' a report.

645
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,791
That guy isn't gonna come back
and bother you.

646
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:44,627
I'll bet you scared him off
pretty good, huh?

647
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:50,400
Besides...I won't let him
ruin the fun.

648
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:53,403
[intense music]

649
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:59,642
-Thanks
'cause...my friend's inside

650
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:01,911
and she's pretty upset
about the whole thing.

651
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,347
She wants to go home.

652
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:05,448
We all do.

653
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:08,918
-Mm, lady friend, huh?

654
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:12,922
-I'll bet you like to party.

655
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,291
I bet you like to party
with the ladies.

656
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:17,627
-Paul?

657
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:27,036
-Hey. Is everything okay?

658
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:29,839
-Oh, hey there, sugar.

659
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:33,676
Oh, everything is, uh,
it's just fine.

660
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:36,746
Why don't you take your
pretty little self back inside

661
00:43:36,748 --> 00:43:41,985
just relax, put your feet up
and, uh, pop up another 40.

662
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:44,153
<i> It's all good.</i>
-Okay.

663
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,122
Ahem. Okay, then.

664
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:57,634
-Shit.

665
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:02,972
Now that girl is hot.

666
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,875
If you're askin' me,
you gotta stay and party.

667
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:09,846
-<i> Oh, you know,</i>
<i> that's why we came here</i>
<i> in the first place.</i>

668
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:13,082
-Yeah, boy..

669
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:18,421
...ain't this some kind
of wonderful...shit?

670
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:22,291
<i> I'd say that creep really did</i>
<i> a number on your jeep here.</i>

671
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:24,927
-Do you think you can get
someone up here to fix it?

672
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:27,497
-Of course. I'm not an idiot.

673
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,599
I'll take care of you.

674
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:31,701
I could probably have
someone here by, uh

675
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:35,204
I don't know,
tomorrow afternoon?

676
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:37,807
I want you to know you're
in my top priority..

677
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:40,443
...'cause you're my party man..

678
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:44,213
...and this is party town.

679
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:45,882
We're all gonna party, right?

680
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,585
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

681
00:44:49,587 --> 00:44:51,020
-Yeah.

682
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,355
-You know how to find me?

683
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,559
-Dial 911?

684
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,396
-That's right.

685
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:02,231
Yeah, that's right.

686
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:06,102
Take care of that little peach
in there.

687
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:08,271
She sure looks sweet.

688
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:13,009
[engine starts]

689
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:26,189
[instrumental music]

690
00:45:45,477 --> 00:45:47,643
-This is bullshit.

691
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,414
[gags]

692
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,282
Oh, shit.

693
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:56,119
So is she gonna report it
or not report it?

694
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:58,855
-I don't think she is.

695
00:45:58,857 --> 00:46:01,624
But she didn't make it sound
like we did anything wrong.

696
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:04,560
She said she'll have a tow truck
up here by tomorrow.

697
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:07,797
-Sounds...weird.

698
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,299
-It was.

699
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:13,770
-How's Karen? Has she come out
of her room yet?

700
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:15,271
-No, I think she's sleeping.

-Why don't you sleep in it?
-Maybe I will.

-Alright. You guys are right.

912
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:50,646

I can't take this shit anymore.
I can't do this by myself.

And I'd prefer if we didn't
fucking argue about everything!

-Not another word!

I can't handle anymore
of this shit!

I don't want
any of us to get sick

1001

but you fucking idiots
insist on moving her

1002

and now you're covered

We're going down."

-One more step,
I will kill you.

This is what's gonna fucking
happen, you bitch.

You're gonna go look for me
at the cabin..

for a doctor.

Don't touch anything
at the cabin.
