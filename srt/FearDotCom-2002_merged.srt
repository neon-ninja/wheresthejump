1
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,692
No!

2
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,675
Damn.

3
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,697
Thanks for the present, Bennie.

4
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,119
I guess we're in the same business.

5
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,169
Okay. I'm on my way.

6
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,756
Don't want to keep the roaches waiting.

7
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:31,104
-Hey, Mike. Watch your step.
-Yeah, yeah.

8
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,152
-These tracks are still Iive?
-Williams, over here.

9
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,284
Jesus Christ.
What happened to him?

10
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,412
I don't think he got eIectrocuted.

11
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,375
What's going on with his eyes?

12
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,879
Don't know yet.
We'll have to wait for the autopsy.

13
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,800
What did this guy see to Ieave
an expression Iike that?

14
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,052
Any witnesses?

15
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,097
Not to the accident. A guy went to grab
a paper out of the newsstand.

16
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,350
When he came back,
the victim was Iike this.

17
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:12,646
According to this guy, his eyes
were bIeeding prior to the swan dive.

18
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,274
-Must have been into computers.
-His name's PoIidori.

19
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,735
He and another guy wrote the book.

20
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:23,448
Must have tried to stop the train with
it. Had to pry it out of his fingers.

21
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,566
Now all we need is the Ieading Iady.

22
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,097
-You want one?
-No, thanks.

23
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:17,270
Give it up, Mike. The Feds
are covering that now. It's over.

24
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,314
The Feds haven't done shit.

25
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,734
Not hearing from him
doesn't mean he's stopped.

26
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:30,325
You're pissed off because this Doctor guy
keeps sending you Iove Ietters.

27
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:35,956
Everyone has cases they can't crack.
Don't Iet it fuck with your head.

28
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,459
What now?

29
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:52,514
Get him out of here. Put him
in a hoIding pen, an empty one.

30
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:58,478
And get someone to transIate
whatever Ianguage he's speaking.

31
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,355
Jesus Christ.

32
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:06,486
Check him for a passport, an ID,
something in fucking EngIish.

33
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:11,157
It says he's a German exchange student,
Dieter Schrader.

34
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:15,078
Lives over in the Village.
Here's the address.

35
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,831
Call the heaIth bunnies, DOH.

36
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:22,669
Find out if there's some bug going
around, something with bIoody eyes.

37
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,047
They can send someone to meet me
at his apartment.

38
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,051
Sykes! Leave the doughnut shop here.
Let's go! Come on.

39
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,886
Johnny!

40
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,660
Know any German?

41
00:08:55,869 --> 00:09:00,498
-I can sing ''She Loves You'' in German.
-Great. That'll heIp.

42
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,421
PoIice!

43
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,757
Anyone here?

44
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,949
Artists.

45
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,455
-I wouIdn't touch her just yet.
-Jesus.

46
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,959
Actually, Terry Huston,
Department of HeaIth.

47
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,546
-Detective Reilly. You got here fast.
-Yeah.

48
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,926
Goddamn it.

49
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,263
God!

50
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:25,059
-What do you make of this?
-This is really fascinating.

51
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:31,566
She's dispIaying possibIe signs of a
hemorrhagic virus. Something Iike EboIa.

52
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,735
Excuse me.

53
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,404
-Reilly.
-"Reilly, we got a problem."

54
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:43,536
Sykes! Hello? Sykes? What are
you doing? Call the coroner.

55
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,747
Yeah, right.

56
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,415
Jesus.

57
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,917
What is it?

58
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,544
You better get back to the station.

59
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:56,174
I got a dead girI, a woman from DOH
saying we have a serious probIem.

60
00:11:56,341 --> 00:12:00,094
-I'm not going anywhere.
-"I think you better get back here."

61
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,263
And bring the DOH with you.

62
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,974
Do you have a pIastic bag?

63
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,603
-That's evidence.
-Yeah.

64
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,533
Excuse me. Excuse me.

65
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:38,508
-That's German. It means ''murderer.''
-I got that. What's with the 48?

66
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,969
Don't know.

67
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,516
BarIow, what happened here?

68
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,186
The guys said he was taIking
to himseIf. That's it.

69
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,939
We'll know more when we get him
to the morgue.

70
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,108
All right, stand back.

71
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,112
Great.

72
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,785
ShouId we be in one of those suits
they're wearing?

73
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:11,833
-We're probabIy aIready infected.
-So we couId all just be dying here?

74
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,170
What is it with you peopIe?
You just Iet this shit run wiId?

75
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,967
Thanks.

76
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:27,515
Serum paneI is all cIear.
It's not a virus.

77
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,809
So we're back at square one.

78
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,645
We've got the camcorder.

79
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:02,050
Sorry about the space patroI,
but we had to be sure.

80
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:07,180
No probIem. I Iove needIes stuck in me.
It's a hobby of mine.

81
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,725
So you Iike working with bugs
and viruses?

82
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:15,396
Someone's got to do it. Otherwise,
disease spreads out of controI.

83
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,023
You do the same thing.

84
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:22,028
At Ieast I can see what I'm deaIing with.
This other shit creeps me out.

85
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,030
I hate germs and....

86
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,406
Diseases.

87
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,783
What about bugs?

88
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,036
I pretty much hate them too.

89
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,039
-You know you sIeep with bugs?
-What?

90
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,083
You sIeep with bugs.

91
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,045
No, I don't, actually.

92
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,255
Yeah, you do. Everyone does.

93
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,259
Dust mites. They're in your carpets,
in your bed.

94
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:50,056
They Iook Iike IittIe Iobsters.
In fact, they're distant reIatives.

95
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:55,144
-You're enjoying this, aren't you?
-I just don't get out much.

96
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,522
I can see that.

97
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,664
I'm sorry.

98
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:19,085
I'm being inconsiderate,
making you uncomfortabIe.

99
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:25,174
I'm so used to seeing through a Iens,
I forget how intimidating a camera can be.

100
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,303
I'm doing a IittIe fiIm
at the WiIton Theatre, and....

101
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:34,976
You know, I can't say this
without it sounding Iike a Iine, but....

102
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:39,856
I was fiIming you because you
happen to be the perfect Ieading Iady.

103
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,482
Do you mean that?

104
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,277
I can't promise anything...

105
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,904
...but come by the theater tonight...

106
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:51,117
...I'll put you in front of the camera,
see what happens.

107
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:10,845
You have to punch this button.
Then you can record us.

108
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,306
Hard to beIieve that's the same guy.

109
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,567
Wait!

110
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,891
-I can watch this Iater.
-Wait a second.

111
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,007
The guy's Iosing it.

112
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,439
Oh, my God.

113
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,111
Jesus.

114
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,157
Hello?

115
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,188
Hello?

116
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,495
Hello?

117
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,763
The sun's out.

118
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,266
Another storm coming.

119
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,186
Shit!
I got a ticket.

120
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,443
I think I can take care of this
for you.

121
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,111
Really?

122
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,990
So I'll see you Iater?

123
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,659
Thanks.

124
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,381
Terry, couId you come in here?

125
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,302
Mr. Turnbull?

126
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,607
Did you want something?

127
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,068
No.

128
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,986
Yeah.

129
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:23,282
What happened with the German kids?
Is it EboIa?

130
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,577
No. I don't even think it's a virus.

131
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,622
-What, then?
-I don't know.

132
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,791
Are you okay?

133
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:37,630
Yeah, I'm just tired.

134
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,050
Let me know if you hear anything, okay?

135
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,135
Sure.

136
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,774
-Where did your computer go?
-Broke.

137
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,112
I sent it in for repair.

138
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:06,325
-PIaying on the Internet too much?
-Yeah.

139
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,586
Well, I'm gonna go finish my report.

140
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

141
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,377
Hot!

142
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:10,342
Cause of death appears to be a stroke
brought on by a surge of adrenaIine.

143
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,178
No signs of vioIence
except the bIeeding.

144
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:17,016
Hi, you must be Terry Huston.
I'm Thana Brinkman.

145
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,225
One moment.

146
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:23,272
Severe rupturing to the ocuIar
bIood vesseIs. I can't account for it.

147
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,357
Heart is compIeteIy engorged.

148
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,444
There's a massive hemorrhage
to the cerebraI cortex.

149
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,113
Death was instantaneous.
End report.

150
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:35,576
-So it was a stroke.
-UnIess Iab tests find something eIse.

151
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:40,539
There's no known virus,
bacteria or viruIent protein.

152
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,583
Excuse me.

153
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,421
Brinkman.

154
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,383
We have another one.

155
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,608
Oh, my God.
It's Eddie Turnbull.

156
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,240
Did your husband have
any medicaI probIems?

157
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,952
Any condition that wouId contribute
to his sudden death?

158
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,791
Other than the chain-smoking
and the chronic stress?

159
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:29,630
I tried to warn him. It never bothered
him untiI these Iast coupIe of days.

160
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:33,425
He got kind of sick,
started seeing things.

161
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,553
-What kind of things?
-Crazy things.

162
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,847
Said someone was watching him.

163
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:43,102
Kept taIking about a IittIe girI.
There was no IittIe girI.

164
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,105
I think he worked himseIf to death.

165
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,691
AIways working.
AIways on his computer.

166
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,239
You know what's odd, though?

167
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:58,367
It was Iike he was afraid of it.

168
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:08,043
Mrs. Turnbull, do you mind
if we take this?

169
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:02,514
Now, you and I share
a great responsibiIity...

170
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,767
...to them.

171
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:10,230
They've come to watch
but aIso to Iearn.

172
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,233
We will provide a Iesson...

173
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,195
...that reducing reIationships...

174
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:20,741
...to anonymous, eIectronic impuIses...

175
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,535
...is a perversion.

176
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:37,633
But here, we offer intimacy.

177
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:44,181
So tell us about yourseIf,
who you are, where you're from.

178
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,558
Do you have brothers and sisters?

179
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,687
Did you dream of being a ballerina
when you grew up?

180
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,815
You're gonna kill me, aren't you?

181
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,990
Of course I'm gonna kill you.

182
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:07,788
The Internet offers birth,
sex, commerce...

183
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:13,126
...seduction, proseIytizing,
poIitics...

184
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,712
...posturing.

185
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,758
Death is a IogicaI component.

186
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:24,012
An intimate experience
made more so...

187
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,515
...by knowing the victim.

188
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,979
So, Karen...

189
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:37,150
...tell us your hopes and dreams.

190
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,448
Nothing. Nothing in common.

191
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,786
PoIidori had a bad chiIdhood,
some juveniIe stuff.

192
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,080
CIeaned up at tech schooI.

193
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:54,626
German kids seem cIean. One was
arrested for weed, big surprise.

194
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,672
Turnbull didn't even have
a traffic ticket. I don't know.

195
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:02,384
Let's start over.
We gotta be missing something.

196
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:07,097
They all had the same pattern
of bIeeding, right?

197
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,308
They all had burnt computers.

198
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,853
Maybe this guy was trying
to tell us something.

199
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,064
We gotta get these computers
checked out.

200
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:20,569
I know a forensic programmer, Denise
Stone. She's worked with me before.

201
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,904
She might be abIe to heIp.

202
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:27,200
We need to find a common Iink
on these computers.

203
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:33,040
-They Iook pretty fried, and this one....
-You think you can do it?

204
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,293
The data shouId still be retrievabIe.

205
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,713
UnIess the fiIes have been corrupted.

206
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,759
I'll see what I can do.

207
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,137
-You're the best.
-I know.

208
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,746
Turn around, Bennie.

209
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,583
I don't want you watching this.

210
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,328
Forty-eight hours. 48.

211
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,228
Do you like to watch?

212
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,245
Okay, I think we get the idea.

213
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,369
I'm waiting for you.
Denise.

214
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,273
Come and find out.

215
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,358
Don't you want to play with me?

216
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,115
Do you want to hurt me?

217
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,790
You're lying.

218
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:17,199
How enticing the smell
of cheap perfume can be.

219
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,119
Or is that fear?

220
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:31,713
I'd Iike to say I can feeI your pain...

221
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,132
...but I can't.

222
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,261
I can't feeI anything.

223
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:41,181
I've been deprived of that somehow.

224
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,978
I know what I shouId feeI.

225
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,483
I just can't feeI it.

226
00:35:55,612 --> 00:36:01,284
You can end this Iesson whenever
you wish. SimpIy ask me to kill you.

227
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,580
She wants to Iive.

228
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,667
Very well.

229
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:14,297
Let the Iesson commence.

230
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,398
-Denise!
-It's you.

231
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:56,649
-Hi.
-What's wrong?

232
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:00,570
I'm fine. I just came to give you this.

233
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,624
-Where did you get this?
-I was there.

234
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,542
What do you mean?

235
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,795
Denise, tell me.

236
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,839
The one thing all the victims
have in common...

237
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:23,968
-...is the Fear site.
-That doesn't make any sense.

238
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,763
-He wouIdn't use the same site twice.
-Who?

239
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,349
The Doctor.

240
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:33,978
-Who's the Doctor?
-A skeIeton in my cIoset.

241
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,940
It's a Iive-cam death site.

242
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:40,318
That's not Iike Turnbull.
Why wouId he watch that?

243
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,153
PeopIe Iove to see death.

244
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,658
Why do you think the ratings are
so high on reaIity disaster shows?

245
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:53,081
Maybe it's a way to find out about
death before it's your turn.

246
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,500
I gotta go.

247
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:59,712
Wait. Do you think you can trace
who's running the site?

248
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,757
-Sure.
-Are you sure you're okay?

249
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,095
Yeah, I'm fine. Fine.

250
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,346
Denise....

251
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,058
Be carefuI. We'll see you soon.

252
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,896
-Hey, come on.
-Where we going?

253
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:20,275
I did some reading Iast night.

254
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:47,594
-We're Iooking for Frank Bryant.
-Over there in the back, hon.

255
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,805
-Last tabIe.
-Okay, thanks.

256
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,107
Frank Bryant?

257
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,071
Are you Mr. Frank...

258
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,535
...Bryant?

259
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:20,710
-How can I heIp you, officers?
-How did you know we were cops?

260
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:26,007
Nobody ever says my name
that way except cops.

261
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,428
We're not here to cause
you any troubIe.

262
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:33,890
We read your book,
the parts we couId understand.

263
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:38,228
Really? I didn't reaIize
my book was still being soId.

264
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:42,565
-We found it on a dead man.
-A guy named PoIidori.

265
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,651
PoIidori?

266
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:46,611
PoIidori is dead?

267
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:49,989
What can you tell us about him?

268
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,534
A good guy.

269
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:53,826
A decent friend.

270
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:58,831
Why wouId he be cIutching your book
as if it were the HoIy GraiI?

271
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:03,002
I couIdn't make much
sense of it myseIf.

272
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,798
That's because it was a Ioad of shit.

273
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,551
I needed a new car,
so I wrote the book.

274
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:14,681
I was driving aIong one day, Iooking
at the teIephone poIes and the wires...

275
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,182
...and I came up with this idea.

276
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:22,605
What wouId happen if you connected
a whoIe bunch of computers together?

277
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:27,735
You'd get one big computer.
Like a supercomputer.

278
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,195
A neuronet.

279
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:34,951
PoIidori and I used to spend
Iong nights taIking about it.

280
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,371
He came to beIieve that the Web
couId receive energy...

281
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:42,375
-...store it, send it out.
-Energy. What kind?

282
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,794
-Here you go.
-Thanks, doll.

283
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,631
Fuck if I know. I mean, you know....

284
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:52,176
Negative energy, magnetic fieIds...

285
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:58,600
...psychic energy steaIing
your souI. You know?

286
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,771
-And?
-PoIidori beIieved he knew...

287
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,649
...where that site existed.

288
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,447
But then again,
PoIidori was fucked up.

289
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,532
And now...

290
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,577
...he's dead.

291
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,913
Do you remember the name of the site?

292
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,793
-No idea.
-Do you think he was right?

293
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,589
I never beIieved a word of it.

294
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:33,009
But then, I'm drunk by 8 p.m.

295
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,387
It's noon.

296
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:40,391
Hey, I'm ahead of the game.

297
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,562
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Bryant.

298
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:48,107
-If we need to reach you....
-I'll be here.

299
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:52,111
-I have no reason to Ieave.
-Okay.

300
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,125
Oh, my God.

301
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:11,381
She was the first. Jeannie Richardson.
He killed her on the Fear site.

302
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,467
He tortures his victims
till they beg to die.

303
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,638
-This is the Doctor, right?
-Yeah.

304
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:22,684
His name's AIistair Pratt.
He was thrown out of medicaI schooI.

305
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,062
Nine months, he fucked with me.
I never even got cIose.

306
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:27,563
How come?

307
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:32,485
After every killing, he'd change
the site. We couIdn't trace it.

308
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,659
What time did PoIidori die?

309
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:47,417
-Three a.m.
-Turnbull was Iater, about 6, right?

310
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,794
6:1 5.

311
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:53,548
Based on that, these victims
died two days to the minute...

312
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,469
...after they Iogged on to the site.
The German kid was trying to tell us.

313
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,930
Shit. Denise.

314
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,532
Come on, Denise.

315
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,204
-You trying to get ahoId of Denise?
-Why?

316
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:29,041
She was supposed to drop something off.
She didn't show--

317
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,794
Get units over there now!

318
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:36,466
-What you taIking about?
-I said get units over there now!

319
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,749
-She's not there. She's not answering.
-Keep trying.

320
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:43,718
-Just diaI it again.
-I am. I just tried. She's not there.

321
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,811
I shouId never have
gotten her invoIved.

322
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,648
I shouId have fucking warned her.

323
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:42,526
-It's not your fauIt.
-I still don't get one thing.

324
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:47,949
Everybody died 48 hours after they went
on to that site, right? Everybody.

325
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,368
Denise doesn't fit the pattern.

326
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:55,039
Maybe it was easier to die
than face whatever is on the website.

327
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,208
What do you mean?

328
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:01,170
Eddie Turnbull was terrified
of car crashes.

329
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:04,632
It was a chiIdhood thing.
He was manic about it.

330
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:10,012
I did some research. Did you know the
German girI was terrified of drowning?

331
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:13,099
-But she didn't drown.
-She died in water.

332
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:16,352
Maybe she died of her greatest fear.

333
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:21,107
I don't know, Terry.
I don't know, I think you're reaching.

334
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:24,276
-Maybe.
-Denise got too cIose.

335
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,363
Someone killed her.
It's as simpIe as that.

336
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:30,449
Can you promise me one thing?

337
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,286
That you won't visit that site?

338
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,284
God, Denise.

339
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,720
Do you like to watch?

340
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:08,524
Do you want to see more?

341
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,081
Do you want to hurt me, Mike?

342
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,294
Jeannie!

343
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:33,299
I know who you are,
and I know what you really want.

344
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:47,855
Time to play.
Time for us to become one.

345
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,858
How do I pIay?

346
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,612
Find me.

347
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:58,782
You have 48 hours.

348
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,835
Me.

349
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,509
What happens if I Iose?

350
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:20,804
You die.

351
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:25,309
Do you want to play?

352
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:28,395
What are you afraid of?

353
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

354
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,174
God!

355
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:13,602
Jesus.

356
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,942
Sorry, did I scare you?

357
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,214
Miss, your gIove.

358
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,244
Mike?

359
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,377
The website. I saw her.

360
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:45,546
-Who did you see?
-The dead girI.

361
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:48,549
-What dead girI?
-Jeannie Richardson.

362
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,801
I saw her.

363
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,096
Bryant was onIy haIf right.

364
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:57,933
-What do you mean?
-It's not just energy.

365
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:03,105
-I don't understand.
-She's out there, aIive in the wires.

366
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,860
If the will is strong, it can Iive
in the objects around it.

367
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:11,196
You don't go there, all right?
Promise me.

368
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:14,157
Tell me you won't go there!

369
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:18,161
Don't go there!
Promise me you won't go there!

370
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:21,331
Forty-eight hours.

371
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:02,581
Hello, Terry. Are you ready to play?

372
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:10,255
Why are you killing Mike?

373
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:12,799
Guilty.

374
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:18,889
GuiIty of what?

375
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,767
Watching.

376
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:25,354
Are you ready to play?

377
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:27,564
Yes.

378
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,987
Shit!

379
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,252
-Hey, Sykes.
-Hey.

380
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:15,756
I need to take a Iook
at the Doctor fiIes.

381
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,884
Let's go in here.

382
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,846
Look.

383
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:25,932
The Feds are covering this now.

384
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,771
I suppose you think
you can do better?

385
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:38,487
Mike doesn't Iike peopIe fucking
with his-- Stop! All right!

386
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:43,909
Jesus-fucking-Christ.

387
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,745
Knock yourseIf out.

388
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,962
Jeannie Richardson.

389
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:00,217
Yeah, she was beautifuI.

390
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:04,054
Yeah, Jeannie. I checked out
her addresses. Shit hoIes.

391
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:08,517
Artist/modeI, my ass.

392
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:15,982
You, though...

393
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:18,193
...you're a different story.

394
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:21,446
Will you shut the fuck up?

395
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:40,048
Oh, my God.

396
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:56,106
Joseph StaIin said that the death
of one person is a tragedy...

397
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:59,818
...the death of a million: a statistic.

398
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:06,575
Your death will give meaning
to all us sad, IittIe Iives out there.

399
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:14,249
See? The audience is never wrong.

400
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:20,649
They smell death

401
01:03:54,366 --> 01:03:56,327
Mrs. Richardson?

402
01:03:56,702 --> 01:04:00,247
Do you have a moment
to taIk about your daughter?

403
01:04:04,627 --> 01:04:08,088
This is Jean Marie on the day
of her First Communion.

404
01:04:08,297 --> 01:04:13,302
This is the Jeannie I know, not what
they said. They didn't know her.

405
01:04:13,886 --> 01:04:16,347
So beautifuI.

406
01:04:16,513 --> 01:04:19,642
She was a happy chiId
despite her condition.

407
01:04:24,188 --> 01:04:28,317
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

408
01:04:28,525 --> 01:04:31,195
Condition? Did you say, condition?

409
01:04:31,362 --> 01:04:34,365
Jean Marie was a hemophiIiac.

410
01:04:34,531 --> 01:04:38,911
Without medication, she couId
bIeed to death from just a scratch.

411
01:04:39,078 --> 01:04:41,872
Left her scared to death
of anything sharp.

412
01:04:42,456 --> 01:04:47,461
-Scissors or knives.
-Yes. That ball....

413
01:04:47,628 --> 01:04:52,508
She aIways had that thing with her.
WillfuI chiId, wouIdn't give it up.

414
01:04:53,133 --> 01:04:58,973
It wasn't untiI she discovered boys
that she finally Ieft it behind.

415
01:05:00,224 --> 01:05:04,561
CouId you take a Iook at these
pictures for me and tell me...

416
01:05:04,728 --> 01:05:08,774
...if there's any pIaces
that you recognize in them?

417
01:05:14,446 --> 01:05:18,409
It's the oId PoeIzig steeI mill
two miIes down the road.

418
01:05:18,575 --> 01:05:21,453
Jeannie used to pIay there as a chiId.

419
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

420
01:06:38,989 --> 01:06:40,574
What are you watching?

421
01:06:45,496 --> 01:06:48,415
You seem Iike you were expecting me.

422
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

423
01:07:04,515 --> 01:07:06,934
Where is she?

424
01:07:17,027 --> 01:07:18,570
No.

425
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,093
Mike Reilly, where is he?

426
01:10:30,095 --> 01:10:32,264
Excuse me? Can I heIp you?

427
01:10:32,472 --> 01:10:34,308
Just tell me where he is!

428
01:10:34,474 --> 01:10:38,228
PIease caIm down,
or I'll have to ask you to Ieave.

429
01:10:38,353 --> 01:10:40,022
Yeah, okay, I'm sorry.

430
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:44,192
I'm sorry, I just--
I really need to see him right now.

431
01:10:44,318 --> 01:10:47,821
Okay. First door on your Ieft.

432
01:11:01,084 --> 01:11:02,544
Hello?

433
01:11:02,878 --> 01:11:05,255
Hello, Terry.

434
01:11:05,505 --> 01:11:07,591
Are you ready to play?

435
01:11:07,758 --> 01:11:12,554
-Goddamn you, what do you want?
-"Play the game. Find me."

436
01:11:12,763 --> 01:11:14,681
Where are you?

437
01:11:14,848 --> 01:11:17,434
Time is running out.

438
01:11:17,601 --> 01:11:20,562
Leave me aIone! Where are you?

439
01:11:26,902 --> 01:11:29,154
Oh, my God.

440
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

441
01:13:02,748 --> 01:13:04,624
Do you like to watch?

442
01:13:11,548 --> 01:13:14,676
I am waiting for you.

443
01:13:16,678 --> 01:13:18,597
Jeannie?

444
01:13:19,389 --> 01:13:22,017
Come and find out.

445
01:13:28,065 --> 01:13:31,359
Don't you want to play?

446
01:13:39,534 --> 01:13:42,579
Do you want to hurt me?

447
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:59,429
You're lying.

448
01:14:09,106 --> 01:14:11,191
Oh, my God.

449
01:14:14,277 --> 01:14:17,864
I found you. I found your body.
I did what you wanted.

450
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,578
I know who you are.

451
01:14:24,496 --> 01:14:28,041
And I know what you really want.

452
01:14:30,293 --> 01:14:33,088
Time to play.

453
01:14:34,548 --> 01:14:37,259
Time for us to become one.

454
01:14:40,428 --> 01:14:42,889
Find me.

455
01:15:51,458 --> 01:15:53,627
Oh, my God.

456
01:15:57,339 --> 01:15:59,799
What time is it?

457
01:16:13,647 --> 01:16:16,358
You shouIdn't Ieave
your front door open.

458
01:16:16,524 --> 01:16:19,444
-Oh, my God.
-It invites illegaI entry.

459
01:16:19,653 --> 01:16:21,196
Mike.

460
01:16:28,662 --> 01:16:30,247
Terry.

461
01:16:31,706 --> 01:16:33,583
What did you do?

462
01:16:34,251 --> 01:16:35,543
Why?

463
01:16:37,754 --> 01:16:43,051
-You just ran out, didn't you?
-More Iike a sIow trot.

464
01:16:43,551 --> 01:16:46,012
You gotta go back.

465
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:49,182
No, they can't heIp me now.

466
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:54,312
-I'm drifting in and out more and more.
-Okay.

467
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:57,399
-I'm running out of time.
-We gotta go.

468
01:16:57,607 --> 01:16:59,526
-Where are we going?
-The morgue.

469
01:17:01,111 --> 01:17:04,698
Are you two okay?
You don't Iook good.

470
01:17:04,948 --> 01:17:07,867
You shouId see it from our side.

471
01:17:09,577 --> 01:17:14,165
I just thought once we found the body,
that wouId be an end to it.

472
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:18,003
No, there's got to be more to this.

473
01:17:18,211 --> 01:17:19,587
She had a reason.

474
01:17:19,713 --> 01:17:23,508
Someone performed an autopsy
on this body a Iong time ago.

475
01:17:23,633 --> 01:17:27,762
-Look at the incisions.
-It's AIistair.

476
01:17:27,929 --> 01:17:31,182
He cut her open whiIe
she was still aIive.

477
01:17:38,148 --> 01:17:39,524
Textbook procedure.

478
01:17:39,649 --> 01:17:44,487
He cut out her viscera.
Then he bagged them and sewed her up.

479
01:17:49,326 --> 01:17:51,202
What's that?

480
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:56,958
She must have swallowed it
before he killed her.

481
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:11,181
''The guiIty must be punished.''

482
01:18:11,639 --> 01:18:14,309
So she didn't want a buriaI.

483
01:18:15,101 --> 01:18:16,644
She wants revenge.

484
01:18:20,398 --> 01:18:22,108
Bingo.

485
01:18:29,324 --> 01:18:31,117
Two days.

486
01:18:31,868 --> 01:18:35,955
Two days is how Iong AIistair
tortured Jeannie before she died.

487
01:18:36,373 --> 01:18:38,208
Knives, Mike.

488
01:18:38,416 --> 01:18:40,794
She died her worst nightmare.

489
01:18:57,268 --> 01:18:59,521
Shit, Terry, I'm Iosing it.

490
01:18:59,687 --> 01:19:02,857
-I'm having troubIe staying here.
-HoId on, okay?

491
01:19:40,061 --> 01:19:41,980
Wait here.

492
01:19:51,781 --> 01:19:53,116
Come on.

493
01:20:05,962 --> 01:20:10,133
Electroshock,
as it is sometimes called....

494
01:20:14,304 --> 01:20:18,766
Electrodes are attached
to the patient's head....

495
01:21:44,727 --> 01:21:45,979
Oh, my God!

496
01:22:33,026 --> 01:22:34,611
Mike.

497
01:22:35,903 --> 01:22:37,238
I found him.

498
01:22:43,202 --> 01:22:45,580
Are you in, or what?

499
01:22:47,498 --> 01:22:49,751
-Two.
-One.

500
01:22:52,629 --> 01:22:56,507
-It better be important.
-"Sykes, I need your help."

501
01:22:56,716 --> 01:22:58,635
What? I'm winning here.

502
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:02,430
-"Look, I found the Doctor."
-So? Call the Feds.

503
01:23:02,597 --> 01:23:05,933
There's no time for that.
I need backup.

504
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:09,103
All right.

505
01:23:10,688 --> 01:23:14,776
-Where is it?
-"A cooling tower. Poelzig steel mill."

506
01:23:15,777 --> 01:23:18,488
I Iove watching these oId tapes.

507
01:23:26,329 --> 01:23:28,498
Jeannie Richardson.

508
01:23:29,832 --> 01:23:31,334
She was my favorite.

509
01:23:35,672 --> 01:23:39,759
You see, I beIieve
death shouId be repuIsive...

510
01:23:39,884 --> 01:23:43,262
...so we don't grow too fond of it.

511
01:23:44,389 --> 01:23:45,640
But...

512
01:23:46,182 --> 01:23:48,184
...all this couId be avoided...

513
01:23:49,519 --> 01:23:51,813
...if you're ready.

514
01:24:55,310 --> 01:25:01,608
No tears. Take joy in the fact
that you've done great good here.

515
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:08,365
You asked for death...

516
01:25:08,574 --> 01:25:10,951
...so I'm no Ionger your murderer.

517
01:25:42,941 --> 01:25:45,319
The time has come, Karen.

518
01:25:56,371 --> 01:25:58,040
Drop it now!

519
01:25:58,165 --> 01:26:01,502
-Drop the fucking knife now!
-BIess my souI.

520
01:26:01,668 --> 01:26:04,713
Reilly, so gIad you couId
make it to the party.

521
01:26:05,005 --> 01:26:07,466
-You brought a date.
-Get away from her.

522
01:26:07,633 --> 01:26:10,177
I'm not gonna fire
a warning shot!

523
01:26:13,597 --> 01:26:16,517
Guns are so impersonaI and artIess.

524
01:26:16,975 --> 01:26:22,856
If you want to hurt someone intimateIy,
you have to get up-cIose and personaI.

525
01:26:23,065 --> 01:26:27,528
You aIready tortured her. Shooting her
wouId be doing her a favor.

526
01:26:27,694 --> 01:26:31,031
You won't shoot.
You suffer from the curse of hope.

527
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:36,119
Yeah, I got hope. I hope my first shot
bIows your fucking head off!

528
01:26:36,245 --> 01:26:39,122
If you kill her, you'll have
no one to hide behind.

529
01:26:39,456 --> 01:26:42,209
I don't want to spoiI things,
but if you're...

530
01:26:42,417 --> 01:26:46,838
...expecting the cavaIry to save
the day, you're gonna be disappointed.

531
01:26:47,047 --> 01:26:49,758
The cavaIry's right there.

532
01:26:50,425 --> 01:26:51,885
Oh, my God!

533
01:26:54,263 --> 01:26:55,180
Fuck!

534
01:26:56,181 --> 01:27:00,894
Not a very nice person, Mr. Sykes.
Appalling eating habits.

535
01:27:01,144 --> 01:27:04,273
Too bad this show aIways
has the same ending.

536
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:06,984
No, not this time.

537
01:27:07,568 --> 01:27:10,362
Someone wants revenge.

538
01:27:39,641 --> 01:27:41,643
No!

539
01:27:50,444 --> 01:27:53,405
I guess the fans Iove a comeback.

540
01:28:03,415 --> 01:28:04,875
Mike.

541
01:28:09,171 --> 01:28:12,799
Look at me. Stay with me.
HoId on. HoId on.

542
01:28:13,675 --> 01:28:19,306
Stay with me. Mike.
Mike, Iook at me.

543
01:28:19,514 --> 01:28:22,809
HoId on. HoId on! Look at me! No!

544
01:28:47,668 --> 01:28:51,421
Attractive women Iike you
sell through the roof.

545
01:28:51,588 --> 01:28:53,173
Just Iike Jeannie.

546
01:29:08,188 --> 01:29:09,398
AIistair.

547
01:29:12,109 --> 01:29:14,027
AIistair!

548
01:30:29,587 --> 01:30:31,338
You're dead! I killed you!

549
01:30:32,006 --> 01:30:33,799
AIistair.

550
01:30:38,304 --> 01:30:40,473
AIistair...

551
01:30:41,849 --> 01:30:44,435
...time to feeI.

552
01:30:57,239 --> 01:30:58,491
GuiIty.

553
01:31:01,285 --> 01:31:03,370
GuiIty.

554
01:31:06,165 --> 01:31:08,542
Time to die.

555
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:15,734
Oh, my God.

556
01:32:15,901 --> 01:32:18,904
No, Mike.

557
01:33:06,994 --> 01:33:08,621
Hello?

558
01:33:10,956 --> 01:33:12,583
Hello?
