I don't know why you're so freaked
out, you're with us, don't worry.

9
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:48,364
This better be worth it.

10
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:51,166

You guys, it's a dead... End.

Seriously?

21
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:08,911
It's not funny.

<i>Enter if you dare.</i>

23
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:02,567
Great. It's a dead end.

24
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:07,669
Shit. Another scare?

25
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:14,411
Wait.

26
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:18,980
You're the one that's been following
me all night, aren't you?

27
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,620
Okay, stop!

28
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:27,291
I'm scared, okay?
Is that what you wanna hear?

29
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,426
Now, leave me alone.

30
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,930
Thank you so much.

31
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:54,709
Nat? Oh, my God!

32
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,144
What? You're here!

33
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:57,812
What? Oh, my God!

34
00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:01,048
- How are you?
- I'm good! How are you?

35
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,985
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

36
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:05,754
- Yay.
- Wow, why is she here?

37
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:07,755
Well, hello, Grade School.

38
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:09,360
It's good to see you.
How's life?

39
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:13,161
- It's great.
- Mmm.

40
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:14,829
Yeah. Why are you here?

41
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,064
Oh, she didn't tell you?

42
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,533
Dude, I live here now.
It's awesome, right?

43
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:19,668
I'm so glad you're here.

44
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,603
I was just telling Taylor
how I hoped you'd make it.

45
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:23,971
Such a surprise!

46
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:25,106
Huge surprise.

47
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,808
Why?

48
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,142
Why is it surprising?

49
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:30,211
Well, I mean,
just last time we talked,

50
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:32,079
you said you were studying.
So I didn't know if...

51
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,449
Studying?

52
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:34,817
Dude, it's October,
it is fun time.

53
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:36,117
You save that for December.

54
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:37,985
Well, some of us have
scholarships, Taylor.

55
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,555
- Kinda need to keep mine.
- Mmm-hmm.

56
00:05:39,557 --> 00:05:40,956
You kinda need to get laid.

57
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,925
Brooke, your bestie needs
to get some,

58
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:45,593
and lucky for her,
Gavin's coming tonight!

59
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,629
You remember Gavin.
Brook already told me

60
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:49,730
you've wanted
to ride that D

61
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:51,166
since you first
laid eyes on him.

62
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:53,437
- Wow.
- Yeah. See, I listen.

63
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,504
I really wish you didn't.

64
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:59,106
"Ride that D," huh?

65
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,478
Her, of all people?
God, she's never liked me.

66
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,045
I don't know why you would
tell her about Gavin.

67
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,884
Hey, can't stay mad.

68
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:09,016
Can't stay mad.

69
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:10,017
Ugh!

70
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:11,887
She calls me "Grade School,"
for God's sake.

71
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:13,988
- I think it's endearing.
- No! It's not endearing.

72
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,089
It's bitchy, maybe.

73
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:16,524
No, it's not.

74
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:17,995
Look, she's not replacing you.

75
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:21,230
Nothing could ever
replace you, okay?

76
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:23,531
Please tell me I don't have to
hang out with her all weekend.

77
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26,802
Uh... Tonight she's coming,
but that's it.

78
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,069
And then, it's just
you and me. Promise.

79
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:29,441
Unless...

80
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:31,606
Unless what?

81
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:34,175
Unless, you know,
you and Gavin

82
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:35,843
want some alone time
this weekend.

83
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:38,247
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing, I promise!

84
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,048
He's just the one that got us
the VIP passes to Hell Fest.

85
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,117
What is that?

86
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,019
Dude, it's so
fucking dope! Okay?

87
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:45,721
Like, it's a traveling
horror night.

88
00:06:45,723 --> 00:06:47,589
People totally lose their shit
in there. It's really fun.

89
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:48,856
You're not
selling me on it.

90
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,591
No, it's great!
It's gonna be fun!

91
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:52,226
Tickets sold out
the minute they went on sale.

92
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:55,596
But your boy Gavin came through
and got some tickets for us.

93
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:57,031
Okay, we don't need
to do this dance now.

94
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:00,035
And he's been
asking about you.

95
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:01,170
- Really?
- He was like...

96
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:04,940
"Hey, Brooke, is your hot
friend coming this weekend?"

97
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:06,307
Wait, he called me hot?

98
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:08,810
Apparently, someone made
a great impression on him

99
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:09,944
this past summer.

100
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:11,012
Why is that surprising?

101
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:14,249
He was like,
"Hey Brooke, uh...

102
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:15,117
"You know, I should get

103
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,685
"an extra ticket
for Natalie, right?

104
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,185
"She's coming.
She's coming, right?"

105
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,555
"Hey, Brooke,
I know this is, like,

106
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:21,023
"really awkward and shit.
But, like,

107
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,990
"do you think that
after Hell Fest,

108
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:25,093
"Natalie will sit on my face?"

109
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:26,865
Shut up, he did not say that!

110
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:30,331
- Did he?
- I don't know!

111
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,033
But, um...

112
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,803
You're not wearing
that, right?

113
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:36,271
Why? What is wrong
with what I'm wearing?

114
00:07:36,273 --> 00:07:37,906
Nat, it's Halloween!

115
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:39,574
It's the one night
out of the year

116
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:42,310
you're allowed to let out
your inner slut.

117
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:43,844
Yeah, I don't think
I have one of those.

118
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:45,947
Hey, babe... Oh. Whoa.

119
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:47,949
Natalie!

120
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:50,752
- I didn't think you were gonna make it.
- Can you knock?

121
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:51,952
Hi! Yeah, no, I'm here.

122
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:53,721
I don't know why everyone
thinks I'm not gonna be here.

123
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,223
What? No. I knew
you were coming.

124
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,992
Brooke was the one
who was like, "It's iffy."

125
00:07:56,994 --> 00:07:58,627
Can you not do that?

126
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:59,827
- What are you in here for?
- I'm just... I'm ready.

127
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:01,062
You guys ready?
You ready for Hell Fest?

128
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,964
- You look ready.
- Baby, we need 10 minutes.

129
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:05,067
We have to meet Gavin at will call.
We're gonna be late.

130
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,670
Babe, you gotta go.
I need 10 minutes.

131
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:10,238
- Okay. I'll see you in 30.
- See you in a bit.

132
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,341
- Love you.
- Okay, so...

133
00:08:12,343 --> 00:08:14,276
We need to find you
something good.

134
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:16,243
And make up for lost time.

135
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,312
This is dope!

136
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:18,379
Oh, my God!
This is awesome, guys!

137
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:20,247
- I know!
- It's gonna be fun!

138
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,783
Nat, don't worry! I will totally
protect you from being murdered.

139
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:24,752
Oh, thanks. I didn't realize
that was a possibility, but...

140
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,220
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

141
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,356
Do not be flippant.

142
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:29,724
It happens,
like in Orange Grove.

143
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:31,225
Oh, yeah, that was
fucked up.

144
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:32,361
Wait, what?

145
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:34,095
Oh, well, a couple
years ago,

146
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,330
a girl got completely gutted

147
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:37,465
in a haunted house,
like, for real.

148
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,867
The killer left her body
in the park for three days.

149
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:41,802
No one found her
until she started to stink.

150
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:43,238
They thought she was
a freaking prop!

151
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,906
- Wait, that's brutal!
- Man, what can I say?

152
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,174
Some people are just evil.

153
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:48,042
I mean, they're monsters.

154
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:50,746
To them, every single day
is Halloween

155
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:52,783
and they dress up,
so that we don't know.

156
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:55,217
Know what?

157
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:56,951
That they walk among us.

158
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,853
Nat, they're fucking
with you!

159
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,253
- Okay, dude...
- Are we?

160
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:00,555
Oh, yes, you are!

161
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:02,657
- Okay, murder twins, we get it. It's scary.
- I know.

162
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:03,724
Whatever.

163
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:04,825
- Oh, my God!
- Quinn!

164
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:06,395
<i>Welcome to Hell Fest!</i>

165
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:08,295
Hell Fest! Hell Fest!

166
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,297
Yes, I'm excited.
Okay, let's go, let's go.

167
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:14,002
<i>I'm so excited! Yes!</i>

168
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:15,706
Hey, murder twins,
wait up!

169
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,773
<i>Welcome to Hell Fest!</i>

170
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:21,276
All right. Let's go.

171
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:23,411
<i>Beyond these gates,</i>

172
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:27,683
<i>your inner fears
will come true!</i>

173
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:34,690
Whoa. Is that her?

174
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:36,724
- Asher's here?
- Yeah. Come on.

175
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,225
Oh, yeah.

176
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,728
You might actually
have to pretend

177
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,733
- you have game tonight.
- Asher!

178
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,565
Hey, boo.

179
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,066
Asher, this is Natalie.
Natalie, Asher.

180
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:46,102
- Hello, pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

181
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:47,301
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

182
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:49,704
- Hey. It's been a while.
- Hey.

183
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:51,406
You look great.
It's good to see you.

184
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:54,175
- Hell Fest!
- Welcome to VIP, bitches!

185
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,411
VIP, bitches!

186
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,347
There you go.
I can help you put yours on.

187
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,614
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

188
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:03,285
Thanks. Yeah, Brooke tells me
I have you to thank for this.

189
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:05,186
- So...
- Yeah, no. No problem.

190
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,488
- Thank you.
- No problem.

191
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,858
No, she said you were
coming to town, so I just...

192
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,193
I wanted us to do
something fun.

193
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,761
Great.

194
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:14,496
- Hey, you guys ready?
- Yeah.

195
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:15,863
You guys ready?

196
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,931
Hell Fest, guys!
Let's do this!

197
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:21,368
Hell Fest!

198
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:37,017
Look it, work it
for me, baby! Work it!

199
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:42,293
Oh, shit! Okay!

200
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:47,863
Hey!

201
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:48,997
Oh, shit!

202
00:10:52,536 --> 00:10:54,268
Good Lord!

203
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,070
Wow!

204
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,305
And then there's that.

205
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:59,340
And then there's that.

206
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:03,111
So, just so you guys know,
fear is an aphrodisiac.

207
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:04,411
Yeah, it stimulates
something...

208
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,948
- The more you know.
- Deep in those lizard brains

209
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,183
and it reminds you
that life is short

210
00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:12,186
and an organism's only true
purpose is to, uh, reproduce.

211
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,722
Okay. That's great.
Thank you.

212
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:17,124
It is. All right, I will let you guys
think about that and I'll be back later.

213
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:19,261
All right.
Thanks for the master class.

214
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,029
You're welcome!

215
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:22,497
I'm starting to get
the feeling our friends think

216
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,398
something's gonna happen
between us.

217
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,967
Really? No, I didn't
notice that at all.

218
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:27,068
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

219
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,170
You don't get
that vibe at all?

220
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:29,237
- No, I don't.
- It's very subtle.

221
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,405
Just you're picking up
on that.

222
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:32,440
Yeah, it's just me.

223
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,977
Hey, well, I'm actually...
I'm glad you came.

224
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:37,145
I think it's gonna be fun.

225
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:39,513
It's been a while
since we've hung out.

226
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:41,116
Yeah, I was bummed
that I had to bail.

227
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,383
I just had a bunch of shit
that I...

228
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:45,420
Jesus Christ!
That came so close to my face!

229
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No!
You're good, this is it.
It's not that bad.
- It's just...
- Not the worst thing, I guess?

230
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:57,065
- It is time for shots!
- Shots!

231
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:58,300
- Yes!
- Shots!

232
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,234
Please, let's go!
Come on!

233
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:38,442
Raise your arms.

234
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:46,317
You're good.

235
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:05,970
Why do you always
switch them?

236
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,502
Thanks, man.

237
00:13:07,504 --> 00:13:09,941
Asher! Hurry up
with those shots!

238
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,407
- Whoa. Shots!
- Yeah!

239
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:15,175
Nice! So we got VIP tonight,

240
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:17,212
so lines aren't gonna be
an issue. We are here,

241
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,512
but we need
to focus our shit,

242
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:19,647
'cause I'm trying to hit
everything tonight.

243
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:20,916
Let's do the Zombie Maze.

244
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:21,983
- Boom.
- Why?

245
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:23,450
Yo, Gav, what are you, five?

246
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:24,652
We didn't come here for slow.

247
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:26,154
If you want that,
go trick-or-treating.

248
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:27,689
We came here to be terrified!

249
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:29,991
The Zombie Maze
is fucking scary, it's...

250
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:31,292
I'm good with the
Zombie Maze. I am.

251
00:13:31,294 --> 00:13:33,060
No, I wanna do Deform School

252
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,462
because I've been
a very naughty girl.

253
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:36,097
And I hear Deform School
is one of the scariest mazes

254
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:37,632
outside of the Deadlands.

255
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:39,434
- Wait, what are the Deadlands?
- What?

256
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:41,069
No, it's a part of the park

257
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,405
where they can all touch you
or something. Right?

258
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,172
Wait. For real,
they can touch you?

259
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:46,641
Yeah. That's where shit's
gonna get crazy.

260
00:13:46,643 --> 00:13:48,142
Sounds fun, right?

261
00:13:48,144 --> 00:13:49,944
Plus, it's the only way
you get to go into Hell

262
00:13:49,946 --> 00:13:52,249
which is the scariest maze,
so...

263
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:56,151
Yeah?

264
00:13:56,153 --> 00:13:57,484
Please?

265
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:00,190
Come on.

266
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,691
Sure.

267
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,062
- To Hell Fest!
- To Hell Fest!

268
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:26,680
Oh, my God!
Dude, you don't scare me!

269
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:27,684
Go back to the other freaks!

270
00:14:56,113 --> 00:14:57,679
I just wanna go back home...

271
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:01,516
What is up with
all these assholes?

272
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:04,151
You think you're scaring me?
Ooh, you're so scary.

273
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,587
No. Move.

274
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:36,550
Wait! You guys,
what the fuck?

275
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:37,685
Come on, come on!

276
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,119
You don't
have to run, like...

277
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:40,454
- I don't like being fast.
- I don't like being...

278
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:42,056
- I don't like that. At all.
- I can't see anything.

279
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:44,159
Okay, we can do this.
It's okay, we got this.

280
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:45,526
Fuck this shit!

281
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,362
Oh, my God!

282
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,662
Okay. Hi,
thank you very much!

283
00:15:48,664 --> 00:15:50,131
Oh, my God!
Holy shit.

284
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:52,633
- Brooke! Okay, okay...
- Go, go, go!

285
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:55,603
Oh, my God!
It's everywhere!

286
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:56,670
That was so stupid!

287
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:58,138
Picture,
picture, picture!

288
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,773
He got her
more than me. Thank God.

289
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:00,842
Let's go.

290
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,776
Cobwebs.
You go, you walk first.

291
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:03,978
Dude, the more scared
you seem,

292
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,646
the more they're gonna come
after you. You gotta like...

293
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:06,747
- You have to play it cool.
- Just relax and...

294
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:08,416
Yes. You... Shit!

295
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:09,717
Oh, my God!

296
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Yeah, no, just play it cool.
I'll remember that.
That's great.
No, that...
I have a very specific phobia
of demon clowns.
These are my people.

297
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:19,627
Jesus Christ.

298
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:21,128
Come on,
come on, come on!

299
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,229
VIP!

300
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,567
Sucks to be you.

301
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:27,868
Okay, I'm sorry.
VIP band, just showed it off.

302
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,140
Tay, they pace it out
so we each go on our own.

303
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:34,108
Oh, can we go? Can we go?

304
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,478
And, wait, wait.

305
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,815
- Go, go, go!
- Thank you!

306
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,116
Okay. Are you ready?

307
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:42,382
- Yeah.
- You that ready?

308
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:43,386
Yep, I'm ready.

309
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:47,658
Go, go, go!

310
00:16:54,498 --> 00:16:56,330
See? I didn't need that
in my life.

311
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:58,398
Don't do that! Oh, my God!

312
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,367
You know what? He deserves
at least some dignity in death.

313
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:01,903
- Let's give him a boner.
- Definitely.

314
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:03,538
Oh, God!
The last thing I need to do

315
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,672
is relive high school.

316
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:06,441
She can keep me after class.

317
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,342
Ow! Hey, Gavin.

318
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:09,610
You like paddles, right?
You said you had a fetish

319
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,245
or something.
She's got a paddle.

320
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,679
I've never said that
in my entire life.

321
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:14,348
Oh, freaky.

322
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,916
I don't like paddles.
They're fucking with you.

323
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:17,351
I mean,
if you do, man.

324
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:18,485
- I never...
- You don't like paddles?

325
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:19,787
- You're such an asshole.
- Hey, guys.

326
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,490
I don't think everyone here
is completely dead.

327
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:26,226
I mean, part of this guy
is very much alive.

328
00:17:27,264 --> 00:17:28,596
Are you sexually harassing
a zombie right now?

329
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:30,631
Because I feel like
that's just a lot.

330
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,633
Look, all I know is

331
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,701
I definitely know
how to make the dead rise.

332
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:35,904
You know how
to make everything rise, baby.

333
00:17:35,906 --> 00:17:37,504
- I guess we're going that way.
- We're going that way.

334
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:39,206
We're supposed
to follow that?

335
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:45,682
Oh.

336
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:49,951
Hurry up!

337
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:51,252
I'm trying. Hold on.

338
00:17:51,254 --> 00:17:52,486
Oh, shit!

339
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,321
Oh. All right. No.

340
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,558
Ruined the damn photo.

341
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,629
I'm scared.

342
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:03,263
Oh, God! One of these guys
has gotta be real.

343
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:05,433
- Oh, yeah!
- Yep.

344
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,570
If you could
go first, that'd be great.

345
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:10,637
This...

346
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,342
- Okay, you have to look at their hands.
- Why?

347
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,578
Then you can tell
which one is real,

348
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,878
if you look at their hands.

349
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,047
Okay, but I don't like
looking at the hands,

350
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:22,416
because then you can't see
their skin and their faces.

351
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:24,819
- Yeah, that's the one.
- There you go.

352
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:27,454
Busted, sir. Or, ma'am.
I can't really tell.

353
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,323
How dare you assume?

354
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:31,925
I don't know, honestly.
They're all kind of...

355
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:33,261
Neutral.

356
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:34,829
Oh, hey.

357
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:35,964
This place is
kind of lame.

358
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:37,498
- Yeah, bummer.
- I like all the art...

359
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:41,171
Fuck! Come on!

360
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Nope! Okay, go!

361
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:04,892
- Did they just ditch us?
- What the fuck?

362
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,797
- Oh, my God!
- Of course they did. Wait.

363
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:09,664
Wait.

364
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,832
Wait, wait.
Don't you spill my tequila.

365
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:13,300
Wait, no, no, no!
I just figured it out.

366
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Look, she just came
out of here.
Somebody else is gonna come
out of here and freak us out.
Oh, great,
thank you for confirming.
Really?
Look, and then she's gonna
jump out here, too.

367
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:23,344
Yes, thank you. Thanks!

368
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:24,412
You're ruining this for me.

369
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,313
No, I'm telling you.
Now someone's just

370
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:28,416
gonna come out of this door
right here.

371
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,716
- All right, let's see.
- Let's see.

372
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:31,953
Stop saying things
at the same time.

373
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:34,521
And Grade School
overthought it.

374
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:35,623
And, three, two... Shut up.

375
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,425
Three, two, one.

376
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,060
Help me! He's following me.

377
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:40,962
- Please!
- Oh. See, your timing was off.

378
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:42,062
And location.

379
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:43,764
Please, help me. Please.

380
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,503
Oh, my God!
He's coming!

381
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:50,440
Okay. Well, I was still
kind of right.

382
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:52,508
So melodramatic.

383
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:55,411
Oh, hi, buddy.

384
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:57,480
Hello.

385
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:59,579
He got the...

386
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:00,481
Okay.

387
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:03,451
Class deceased.

388
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:06,387
If at first you don't
succeed, die and die again.

389
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:08,423
He's got the wonky eyeballs.

390
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:09,991
He's been through some things.

391
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:11,992
Yeah, you're not scary, dude.

392
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:13,660
- Okay.
- Did you see that?

393
00:20:18,668 --> 00:20:21,703
Okay, just get back on script,
guy. Your girl's over there.

394
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:22,971
With the big arrow.

395
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:26,473
Where it says, "Don't look." She's
in that thing, you should...

396
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,848
No, no. Just stop!
Please.

397
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,117
Help me! Please! Please!

398
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:38,019
No, no, no!

399
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:39,454
Stop it!

400
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:40,754
Yeah, no, fuck that. I'm good.

401
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,357
Yep. Let's go.

402
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,491
Stop!

403
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:44,591
Stop it! No!

404
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,109
Okay, just do it.

405
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:34,642
That was
fucking insane.

406
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:36,410
I know. Now you know
why I wanna come here.

407
00:21:36,412 --> 00:21:37,544
Yes, I get it.
This is fucking...

408
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,812
- I know!
- Jesus Christ!

409
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:40,181
Hey, you good?

410
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:41,916
What took you so long?

411
00:21:41,918 --> 00:21:43,650
That was really fucking real
in there at the end.

412
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:45,355
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah! Really intense.

413
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:47,722
You need some?

414
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,490
Yes.

415
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:50,858
Go Grade School.

416
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,462
- Shit!
- Jesus Christ!

417
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:59,434
I love this place
so much!

418
00:21:59,436 --> 00:22:00,501
Come on. Let's go.

419
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:01,868
She just, like, walks away?

420
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,639
You ditched us.
What do you want?

421
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,219
Looks like you made a friend,

422
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,221
Grade School.

423
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:23,023
Well, at least I wasn't crying
like a baby in there, College.

424
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,992
Okay! All right,
I might like you.

425
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:27,494
Let's keep going.
Keep it up.

426
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:28,966
I like this sassy side.

427
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:35,535
Wait, does she still snore
like an outboard motor

428
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:36,637
when she's drunk, because...

429
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:37,737
Like a fucking buzz saw.

430
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:39,840
You two are getting
a little too close, all right?

431
00:22:39,842 --> 00:22:41,809
Well, you can't
stay mad, so...

432
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:43,043
Oh, one night at Hell Fest,

433
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:44,611
and you're coming out
of your shell.

434
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,879
It looks good, right?
It suits her.

435
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:47,548
Yeah.

436
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,715
Look, is that the same guy
from the Deform School?

437
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:50,717
- Hey!
- Don't do that.

438
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:51,886
- Why?
- Jesus Christ!

439
00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:54,155
He's an actor. He gets paid
minimum wage to follow us.

440
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:56,256
But he's only following us.
It's stalker-ish.

441
00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:57,358
- Yo, let's go.
- Keep it moving.

442
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,827
Yo, guys, this is the same
dude from Deform School.

443
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:01,695
Nat, he's just an actor.
They fuck with everyone.

444
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:02,829
Seriously, ignore him.
He'll get bored.

445
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:03,964
It works with Brooke.

446
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,166
Yeah, no, no,
that's great advice.

447
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:06,533
That always works
with stalkers. Thanks.

448
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:07,902
Hey. Listen.

449
00:23:07,904 --> 00:23:10,070
If he gets too close,
I'll fuck him up for you.

450
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:12,138
Oh, my God!
That's adorable. I got it.

451
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,508
You guys are gonna
handle this one?

452
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,810
- Yeah.
- Yeah, of course. We got you.

453
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,512
Dude, I told you
it'd be fun with her here.

454
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:19,547
I know! You're right.
She's awesome!

455
00:23:22,552 --> 00:23:23,818
- This is amazing.
- This is dope!

456
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,520
Oh, crap.

457
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:27,722
Oh, look, it's you.
It's your future, Ash.

458
00:23:27,724 --> 00:23:29,189
Okay. No, no, no!

459
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:34,095
Oh, shit.

460
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:35,929
Come on, girl, let's go
win you some cheap-ass prizes.

461
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:37,798
That is so antiquated
of you, Ash.

462
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,867
- They have funnel cakes!
- Off we go!

463
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:40,935
Have fun, you two.

464
00:23:40,937 --> 00:23:42,669
Hey, Gavin...

465
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,004
Great. That's...

466
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,740
Thanks, Quinn.
That was so subtle of you.

467
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:46,973
Thanks for that.

468
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:48,675
- I'm sorry.
- Um...

469
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,111
Here. Let's play a game.

470
00:23:51,113 --> 00:23:52,946
- Are you ready for this?
- I am. Are you ready?

471
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:54,749
Ready as I'll ever be.

472
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:55,786
Mine.

473
00:23:57,986 --> 00:23:59,619
You are really close.
Maybe it's just your...

474
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:01,023
I just need to stop
overthinking it.

475
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,956
No look.

476
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,825
- What you wanna do?
- I'm doing it, too.

477
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:06,497
Prize time. Dang it.

478
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:10,964
Are you sure
you're not left-handed?

479
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:12,800
- Who won? Who won?
- Yes!

480
00:24:14,337 --> 00:24:16,203
Oh, wow.

481
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,838
Let me show you how it's done.

482
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,173
Well, now I just wanna
keep this.

483
00:24:21,744 --> 00:24:23,780
- For my queen.
- Thanks, babe.

484
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:27,114
- Oh, wow!
- Shit!

485
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:28,316
You definitely took
that somewhere.

486
00:24:28,318 --> 00:24:30,150
- I'm sorry about that.
- Ready, one...

487
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:32,154
Two, three... Go!

488
00:24:34,957 --> 00:24:36,059
This is painful, bruh.

489
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:38,626
- Okay. Thanks.
- It's not that bad.

490
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:39,629
It's pretty bad.

491
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,763
- That was close!
- It was. Thank you.

492
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:44,865
- It was...
- Yeah.

493
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:45,933
- No, no, no!
- No, I got another one

494
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:47,001
- It's more than okay.
- It's really not.

495
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:48,868
We don't have to...
It's been, like, five games.

496
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,204
You know how good
you're gonna feel

497
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:51,472
when you have a teddy bear
of your very own?

498
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:53,640
Sometimes you just have to
accept that it's not for you.

499
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,678
I'm sorry,
I'm so shitty at ring toss.

500
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,746
It's okay.

501
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,014
I was honestly
trying my best.

502
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:03,850
But I think my game of choice
is the one where you're like,

503
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:04,785
"Here's five dollars."

504
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:06,087
And the guy's like,
"Here's a pretzel."

505
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:07,253
So you pay for things?

506
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,656
Yeah, but at an incredibly
fast rate.

507
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:09,590
Okay.

508
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,791
I think that's my game
of choice. Hello.

509
00:25:11,793 --> 00:25:13,094
Oh, hello!

510
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:16,097
What? Can I?
May I? Thank you.

511
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:17,263
Wow! It's so coiffed.

512
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,000
- It really is.
- It's so beautiful.

513
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:20,333
I think you should
get one of those.

514
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:22,369
I was gonna say
I think you should.

515
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:25,005
Well, I can't, so...

516
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:27,140
So what do you think so far?

517
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:28,408
Of the pretzel?

518
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,645
- Uh, no, not the pretzel.
- Good. Could use mustard.

519
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:31,679
I do want a piece of this.

520
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:34,080
- Oh, you're a mustard kind of girl?
- Mmm-hmm.

521
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:35,217
I meant of Hell Fest.

522
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:41,121
What do you think? Like hanging out?
Two of us?

523
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,390
- I like hanging out with you.
- Okay. Good.

524
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:45,358
I'm sorry that I've been
so flaky actually.

525
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,796
I've just been having a really
tough time with school

526
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,830
and work, and life, so...

527
00:25:50,832 --> 00:25:52,201
It's just nice to be here.

528
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,270
- Nice to be in Hell.
- Yep. It's nice to be in Hell.

529
00:25:56,272 --> 00:25:58,075
- It's the best place to be.
- Yeah.

530
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:05,212
- Come here.
- Yeah.

531
00:26:05,214 --> 00:26:08,348
Oh, God! But that was
a perfectly good pretzel.

532
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,353
I'm sorry.
It was not salty enough.

533
00:26:14,223 --> 00:26:16,290
Oh, God, I am so bad
at these things.

534
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:17,425
Oh, we have to pay
under here.

535
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:18,629
Yeah. Okay.

536
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:24,064
- What do we...
- Um...

537
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:26,067
Smile.
Just smile like an idiot.

538
00:26:26,069 --> 00:26:27,467
Not that you're an idiot.

539
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:30,339
No, that's really the only way
I know how to do it.

540
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,312
Uh, drunk face?

541
00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:40,981
Uh, sure, okay. I don't
really have a drunk face.

542
00:26:40,983 --> 00:26:42,950
I don't, either.
I'm a stoic drunk.

543
00:26:42,952 --> 00:26:45,051
Yeah. I'm a
very composed...

544
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,759
Um...

545
00:26:51,761 --> 00:26:53,761
No, no, you don't touch it.
Just your...

546
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:55,128
Well, I didn't know
if I was supposed to...

547
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,300
With my tongue?
What do you want me to do?

548
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:03,069
How could you not know
that I was going

549
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:04,472
- for the nose-tongue picture?
- I don't know

550
00:27:04,474 --> 00:27:05,607
- how many people...
- How dare you.

551
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:08,978
I didn't know there was
a type of picture you take.

552
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,786
Yo!

553
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:53,387
What the fuck? Hey!

554
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:54,554
Is that Brooke?

555
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:57,223
- You sure? Was that Brooke?
- Brooke?

556
00:27:57,225 --> 00:27:58,462
What the hell?

557
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:01,896
That guy just
took your photos.

558
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:03,931
- What?
- Babe, here.

559
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,965
- Whoa. Whoa!
- Hey!

560
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:07,033
- Brooke.
- Babe!

561
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:08,037
- You guys, come on!
- Hey!

562
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,970
What's going on?

563
00:28:09,972 --> 00:28:11,172
- Did you two just...
- Come on,

564
00:28:11,174 --> 00:28:12,408
- let's make fun of him!
- Take pictures together.

565
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:14,945
Yo!

566
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:19,816
Oh, so you're hiding now?

567
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:22,319
You gonna scare me?

568
00:28:52,113 --> 00:28:54,147
Hey, I told you to...

569
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,151
Stop.

570
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,466
Shit!

571
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:15,336
When did you become
a tough guy?

572
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Listen, I scared him off.
Let's go.
Did you?
Did you get the photos?
No, but he's gone.
Here, take this.

573
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:29,116
That's gonna
consume her.

574
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:30,483
It's a pleasure to meet you.

575
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:32,319
Hey, guys! I found
Nat's security guard.

576
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:33,987
Hey, did you get the pictures
back? What happened?

577
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:36,389
I took care of it,
like I said I would.

578
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:37,590
- Is that what you did?
- Yes.

579
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:38,992
It's the same guy, right?

580
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:40,327
- Wait, Deform School guy?
- Yeah.

581
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:41,628
He's just going
for Employee of the Year.

582
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,563
He's doing pretty damn good.

583
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:44,498
I mean, look at both
of your faces right now.

584
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,367
All right, fuck this place
anyway. It is Deadlands time.

585
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,601
I wanna be touched.

586
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:49,502
Yes. Thank you!
Let's go, let's go.

587
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:50,370
All right.
Deadlands. I'm in.

588
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,172
Yeah, you guys go
and then I'm gonna

589
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:54,073
- catch up with you, okay?
- What?

590
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:56,577
Just go, and then I'm gonna
catch up to you guys.

591
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:57,677
- What, what are you...
- Just go.

592
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,112
I wanna
get her a toy.

593
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:00,313
Just go really quick,
and then I'll meet up.

594
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:01,447
Do what you gotta do.

595
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:03,183
- Okay, do you want company?
- No, no, no.

596
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:05,953
Me and the bearded lady,
we exchanged this look.

597
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:07,253
I think she's gonna
give me beard lessons.

598
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:08,289
So, I'm gonna go
get her number.

599
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,291
That's not a thing.
I can just come with you.

600
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:11,358
It's totally a thing.

601
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,425
Okay.

602
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:13,493
So, we'll meet you
in line then?

603
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:14,560
Yeah, dude,

604
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,929
if you're not there
by the time

605
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:17,097
we get to the front
of the line,

606
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:18,398
I'm going to Hell
without you.

607
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,566
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

608
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,466
Just be really fast.

609
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:22,302
'Cause she really likes you.
You know?

610
00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:24,003
And, she thinks
you're really hot.

611
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:25,606
She doesn't wanna
do Deadlands without you.

612
00:30:25,608 --> 00:30:27,374
That wasn't uncomfortable
at all.

613
00:30:27,376 --> 00:30:29,310
- We're going. Let's go.
- You're not hurrying!

614
00:30:29,312 --> 00:30:30,347
All right. Bye.

615
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:37,216
Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

616
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:40,654
Excuse me? Hey, um...
We're VIP, can we just...

617
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:42,556
Babe, this is VIP.

618
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:44,524
- This whole thing is VIP?
- Yeah.

619
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:46,159
Hey, don't worry about Gavin.

620
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:47,528
He's probably pooping
or something.

621
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,030
Okay, I did not need
to picture that.

622
00:30:50,032 --> 00:30:51,264
What? Everybody poops, Nat.

623
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,167
Birds poop, bees poop. Honey!
That's where it comes from.

624
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:55,639
No more drinks for you.

625
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:01,175
Hey. You remember me? Earlier?

626
00:31:01,177 --> 00:31:02,376
I was here playing
the ring toss?

627
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:03,513
And you were terrible at it?

628
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,548
That was me.
Thank you. Yeah.

629
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:10,451
Um, hey, listen,
I spent like $50.

630
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:11,922
Could you just help me out
and give me one of those?

631
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,293
Nah. I'd lose my job.

632
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:22,695
All right. Hey, thank you.

633
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:23,931
Thanks so much.

634
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:26,436
Wait, what actually happened
with that guy that you chased?

635
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:28,601
Mmm.

636
00:31:28,603 --> 00:31:31,538
It got real intense,
so I just bailed.

637
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,374
I can't figure out what
his fucking deal is.

638
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,208
Me either.

639
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,176
But, hey, no,
you're having a great time,

640
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:38,177
Gavin's totally into you,

641
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:39,512
you're stepping out
of your comfort zone...

642
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:41,551
- He's cute, right?
- Hell yeah!

643
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:51,492
Hey,
are we good on stock?

644
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,327
Yeah, we got
plenty of stuffed animals

645
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,461
back in the locker.

646
00:31:54,463 --> 00:31:55,665
We're good.

647
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,569
It just slipped out.

648
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:06,339
Uh, why do we keep
waiting in line for rides?

649
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,075
I thought we were doing mazes.

650
00:32:08,077 --> 00:32:10,644
B, this is the ride that
takes us to the Deadlands.

651
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:12,146
It's the only way
to get there.

652
00:32:12,148 --> 00:32:13,646
Why are we signing a waiver?

653
00:32:13,648 --> 00:32:16,617
I mean, they can touch us
and liability is a bitch.

654
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:18,385
That's really extreme.

655
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:20,553
Extreme is what we want, Nat.
That's why we're here.

656
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:23,322
Plus, if you don't sign
you can't go in.

657
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:25,458
Oh, come on, Nat,
just sign it.

658
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,229
I was just starting to like
the new you.

659
00:32:28,264 --> 00:32:29,362
Huh?

660
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,798
Just let me text Gavin
and let him know.

661
00:32:32,234 --> 00:32:33,302
You sign. I'll text.

662
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,493
Damn.

663
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,804
Okay, Asher.

664
00:33:24,652 --> 00:33:26,121
Oh, yes.

665
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:28,058
Okay...

666
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:37,434
Hmm.

667
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,475
Hmm.

668
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,312
That's good.

669
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:51,281
Oh, shit!

670
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:58,819
It's you again? Seriously?
You're following me now?

671
00:33:58,821 --> 00:34:01,754
Nice. All right, you take
your job way too seriously.

672
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:03,589
Hope you know that.

673
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:05,325
You know, actually,
it's great that you're here.

674
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:07,330
Can I get
my pictures back? Or...

675
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:13,169
All right.

676
00:34:16,171 --> 00:34:18,340
Dude, drop the character,
you're offstage.

677
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:25,380
Cool.

678
00:34:28,684 --> 00:34:30,653
What the fuck
is your problem, man?

679
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,689
Come on, come on,
come on!

680
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:10,856
And...

681
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,626
- Thank you!
- Yes!

682
00:35:12,628 --> 00:35:13,727
Wait. Nat, where is he?

683
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:14,861
I don't know.

684
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,629
Just text him again.
Okay? Come on.

685
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:17,997
Come on.

686
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:19,568
- Come on, guys!
- Yeah, we're coming!

687
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,935
- Sorry.
- Wait, slow down!

688
00:35:26,008 --> 00:35:27,374
Nat, come on!

689
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:29,443
I'm coming.

690
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:50,597
<i>Beware! Night Bumps</i>

691
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:55,405
<i>leads to the Deadlands,
where no soul is safe.</i>

692
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,838
- Night Bumps!
- Yes!

693
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:01,575
Wait, wait, wait.

694
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:02,876
Nat, come on. You gotta get on

695
00:36:02,878 --> 00:36:04,410
or you lose
your place in line.

696
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,447
In or out?

697
00:36:06,782 --> 00:36:08,314
Sucks to be Gavin.

698
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:10,417
- Great to be us.
- Okay.

699
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:11,718
Let's go. Come on,
come on, baby.

700
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,352
- Wait, Brooke.
- Oh, um...

701
00:36:13,354 --> 00:36:14,588
- What?
- Hey.

702
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,555
- We should wait. No.
- No, no, no.

703
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:18,425
No, Gavin assured us,
he would be there.

704
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:19,626
- It's fine. Come on.
- No, wait.

705
00:36:19,628 --> 00:36:21,495
- He'll be right here.
- Wait. Really?

706
00:36:21,497 --> 00:36:23,330
Nat, I don't wanna
split up, so...

707
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:24,765
Gavin'll meet us
on the other side, okay?

708
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:26,432
Yeah. He will be there.
I promise.

709
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,767
Okay?

710
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,836
Yeah. Love you.

711
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:31,037
See you in the Deadlands.

712
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:33,906
<i>Beware the things that go</i>

713
00:36:33,908 --> 00:36:35,075

714
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:36,410
<i>Night Bumps!</i>

715
00:36:36,412 --> 00:36:37,577
I hope she's okay.

716
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:38,847
Babe, she'll be fine.

717
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:41,985
Thank you.

718
00:36:55,764 --> 00:36:57,530
<i>Night Bumps!</i>

719
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:14,013
Oh, okay. Hey!

720
00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:15,716
Oh. Yummy.

721
00:37:15,718 --> 00:37:16,886
I don't like that.

722
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,019
Mmm-mmm.

723
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:21,488
Oh, my God! Wow!

724
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,356
- I'm so scared!
- Oh, shut up.

725
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,727
Crap!

726
00:37:26,729 --> 00:37:28,997
Okay! Did you see the head
on that thing?

727
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:31,968
Jesus!

728
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:35,901
Fuck you, man!

729
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:37,506
Jesus Christ!

730
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:47,780
Shit!

731
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Okay. Great.
Well, there goes that mood.

732
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:47,142
Are you shitting me?

733
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:13,403
Hello?

734
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,173
Hello?

735
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:23,843

<i>Please remain calm while
we attempt to fix the ride.</i>

738
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,653
Excuse me?

739
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:35,187
Do you know how long
this is gonna take?

740
00:39:35,189 --> 00:39:38,024
<i>Please remain calm</i>

741
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:40,963
<i>and try not to lose your head.</i>

742

Hello?

743
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,450
Hello, there's somebody
in here.

744
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:08,524
Hello?

745
00:40:18,066 --> 00:40:19,936

Hello?

747
00:40:23,872 --> 00:40:25,241
Security?

748
00:40:25,907 --> 00:40:27,175
Help me!

749
00:40:29,244 --> 00:40:31,211
Okay... What was that?

750
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:38,718
Yo, did you guys
hear that?

751
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,986
Yeah. It sounds like
Grade School freaking out.

752
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:43,589
No, she's not just
freaking out, that's beyond.

753
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:44,758
She's just getting into it.

754
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,559
See? Here we go. Oh.

755
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,258
<i>You are now
entering the Deadlands.</i>

756
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:22,028
<i>The Other will guide you
on your journey.</i>

757
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,097
That's awesome.
That's brilliant.

758
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:26,098
- Are you kidding me?
- No! No, no, no!

759
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,700
Nat, it was part of the ride,
get it?

760
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:28,836
They fake breaking down

761
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:30,903
and then they climb in
with one of the single riders.

762
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,071
- That's awesome!
- This has been terrifying,

763
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,939
- you asshole.
- Terrifyingly awesome!

764
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:35,874
- No, it's pretty good.
- Nat. Relax.

765
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:38,310
Get that out of my...
I hate you all.

766
00:41:38,312 --> 00:41:39,379
Dude.

767
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:42,585
Asher, Asher!

768
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,755
Oh, shit!

769
00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:48,991
Ah, it's so cool!

770
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:52,292
What the fuck is this?

771
00:41:52,294 --> 00:41:54,263
The hell is that?

772
00:41:55,396 --> 00:41:57,930
Oh, shit!
That girl got wrecked!

773
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,698
I hope that washes out.

774
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,633
So, guys,

775
00:42:00,635 --> 00:42:02,836
uh, what do we do?
Do we just wander around?

776
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:05,037
I don't know. I feel like
we should wait for Gavin.

777
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:07,006
All right, Nat, real talk.

778
00:42:07,008 --> 00:42:08,374
I don't want
to ruin it for you.

779
00:42:08,376 --> 00:42:10,343
But Gavin is out getting you

780
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:12,682
one of those stupid
stuffed animals.

781
00:42:13,381 --> 00:42:15,180
He's just gonna take a while.

782
00:42:15,182 --> 00:42:17,253
Because he sucks. Right?

783
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:19,452
Damn it. Really?

784
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,720
Yes, he likes you, okay? He's
gonna catch up when he does,

785
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:24,025
but we're here now. So let's
have some fun, all right?

786
00:42:24,693 --> 00:42:25,959
Hey, guys...

787
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,327
I think we gotta
check this thing out.

788
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:28,928
He likes you

789
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,198
and we know he's not pooping.

790
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,100
Oh, that's nasty.

791
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:35,368
I think they're in there.

792
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,269
- Step up, Q.
- Yeah, nope.

793
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:39,238
- Go for it.
- No.

794
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,874
- No. No.
- What?

795
00:42:40,876 --> 00:42:42,341
You're such a wuss, Q.

796
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:43,778
Yes.

797
00:42:46,048 --> 00:42:47,247
You okay, Ash?

798
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:48,381
Yeah.

799
00:42:48,383 --> 00:42:49,816
- Then hurry up, man.
- You look good.

800
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,283
I'm good. Hold on.

801
00:42:51,285 --> 00:42:53,252
Come on, baby.

802
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,292
That's gross.
That's in there.

803
00:42:59,294 --> 00:43:00,830
That's why
I didn't do it.

804
00:43:01,696 --> 00:43:02,861
Okay. Hold on.

805
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:03,930
That's nasty.

806
00:43:03,932 --> 00:43:05,698
I think I got
something.

807
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,932
Does he always
make those noises?

808
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:08,801
- I'm almost there.
- You find it yet?

809
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:11,171
Oh, shit!

810
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:12,772
Oh, shit!

811
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Holy fuck!
- He got you!
- Look at your face.
Shut the fuck up.
Take the stupid map.
- Shit!
- Oh, shit!
- Okay. What the fuck?
- Hey!

812
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,381
Let me down!
What the fuck? Put me down!

813
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Uh...
- What just happened?
- Asher!
I don't know.
I'm gonna need her back, dude!
Hey, Taylor.
Tay! Taylor!

814
00:43:31,225 --> 00:43:33,193
I get touching somebody,

815
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:34,193
but picking them up
and taking them away

816
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,894
from their entire group
is kinda fucked up.

817
00:43:35,896 --> 00:43:36,963
- Taylor!
- Tay!

818
00:43:36,965 --> 00:43:38,430
I'm gonna barf.

819
00:43:38,432 --> 00:43:40,432
That guy smelled like
a hobo's asshole.

820
00:43:40,434 --> 00:43:42,769
Wait, how do you know

821
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:44,336
what a hobo's asshole
smells like?

822
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:45,805
Because it smells
like Quinn's mom.

823
00:43:45,807 --> 00:43:47,106
- Oh!
- Where did that guy take you?

824
00:43:47,108 --> 00:43:48,742
I know, that's why I
know what I'm talking about.

825
00:43:48,744 --> 00:43:49,809
They smell so bad,
I'm gonna die.

826
00:43:49,811 --> 00:43:50,812
Oh, shit.

827
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:06,493
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

828
00:44:06,495 --> 00:44:09,265
Um... I guess
we're going with them.

829
00:44:11,832 --> 00:44:13,899
It's all right.
We can do this.

830
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,936
Fuck.

831
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,537
Okay.

832
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:19,004
All right.

833
00:44:19,006 --> 00:44:20,275
- This is awesome!
- Hi.

834
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:23,910
Um, maybe somebody
should text Gavin.

835
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:25,144
- Guys!
- Oh, yeah, he's not...

836
00:44:25,146 --> 00:44:26,981
Where the hell is he?

837
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:48,535
I can't see anything.

838
00:44:48,537 --> 00:44:49,839
I know.

839
00:44:56,544 --> 00:44:58,477
Yo, this is dope.

840
00:44:58,479 --> 00:45:02,048
<i>Welcome to your first trial.</i>

841
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:04,950
<i>Will you conquer your fears</i>

842
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,822
<i>or will your fears
conquer you?</i>

843
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:12,559
Oh.

844
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:15,260
Okay, bye.
Thanks for not killing us.

845
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:17,497
- That was creepy.
- Right?

846
00:45:17,499 --> 00:45:19,899
Okay, guys, I think
this is the triple maze.

847
00:45:19,901 --> 00:45:21,901
Sleep Like a Baby.
Very Bad Dreams.

848
00:45:21,903 --> 00:45:23,068
Your Worst Nightmare.

849
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,806
- Your Worst Nightmare!
- Sleep Like a Baby.

850
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:26,305
Tay, wait up.

851
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,573
We'll see you girls
on the other side.

852
00:45:27,575 --> 00:45:29,477
Hope Gavin catches up. Whoo!

853
00:45:37,952 --> 00:45:39,320
Flashlights?

854
00:45:40,187 --> 00:45:41,387
Whoa.

855
00:45:41,389 --> 00:45:43,890
There is no way the girls' maze
is better than this one.

856
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:50,530
- Is that a baby face?
- Yeah, where is that...

857
00:45:50,532 --> 00:45:52,164
On the ass?

858
00:45:54,236 --> 00:45:55,905
This is so gross.

859
00:46:06,046 --> 00:46:08,184
Shit! Go, go, go!

860
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

861
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,526
Yo, yo. They changed.

862
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,528
How did it do that?

863
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,365
- The girl. Look at the girl.
- The veins.

864
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,566
- Whoa.
- Detail.

865
00:46:27,568 --> 00:46:29,102
This is gnarly.

866
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:31,473
Whoa.

867
00:46:34,008 --> 00:46:35,878
Oh, now that is just awful.

868
00:46:48,957 --> 00:46:50,356
Oh, shit!

869
00:46:50,358 --> 00:46:52,193
Damn! She got me!

870
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Listen, I'm not
going first anymore.
Go, Taylor. Stop laughing.
I don't wanna go first.

871
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:00,602
Go!

872
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:04,640
What?

873
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:10,178
- Whoa. Be careful.
- Okay, this is really cool.

874
00:47:13,481 --> 00:47:15,113
Dude...

875
00:47:15,115 --> 00:47:16,716
That's crazy!

876
00:47:16,718 --> 00:47:18,254
This is dope.

877
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:24,256
I like all the swirlies.

878
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,526
This is so dope.

879
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,129
Like, this is insane.

880
00:47:31,131 --> 00:47:32,231
It's probably...

881
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:33,432
- Shit!
- Jesus Christ!

882
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What is that? Oh!
Shut up, Taylor.

883
00:47:57,559 --> 00:47:59,128
Oh, damn!

884
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:08,070
All right.

885
00:48:13,675 --> 00:48:15,575
Just look at the hands.

886
00:48:15,577 --> 00:48:16,709
Hey, Taylor,
you should go first.

887
00:48:16,711 --> 00:48:19,611
Oh. I hate you
so much right now.

888
00:48:19,613 --> 00:48:21,213
- What if I just...
- No!

889
00:48:24,785 --> 00:48:26,486
Just keeping you
on your toes.

890
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:28,657
Yay. That does
not look comfortable.

891
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:32,392
Okay, is it just me
or is it getting...

892
00:48:32,394 --> 00:48:33,559
No, it's definitely
getting closer.

893
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:35,794
Yeah, but are the hands longer
or are the walls just...

894
00:48:35,796 --> 00:48:36,696
Maybe both.

895
00:48:36,698 --> 00:48:38,231
The walls might be
closing in.

896
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:40,033
All I know is
think little thoughts.

897
00:48:40,035 --> 00:48:41,300
Think little thoughts.

898
00:48:41,302 --> 00:48:42,801
All right, you know what?

899
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:45,104
First of all, woman.
Second of all, not that bad.

900
00:48:45,106 --> 00:48:46,205
Yeah.

901
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000

Let me go!

902
00:49:02,222 --> 00:49:03,458
Get off!

903
00:49:04,793 --> 00:49:06,361
Wait! Brooke! Taylor!

904
00:49:07,128 --> 00:49:08,493
Yo, man.

905
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,000
Yo, my flashlight
went out. What about you?

906
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:14,434
Mine too, dummy.

907
00:49:14,436 --> 00:49:15,368
Hurtful.

908
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,702
Q, it's probably a part
of the gimmick.

909
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Whoa!
That thing's not
slowing down, man.
- No. I know, I know...
- Oh, shit!

00:50:46,693 --> 00:50:47,792
- What guy?
- What are you talking about?

923
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:48,727
The guy!
The guy from Night Bumps.

924
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:50,463
Well, news flash,
he's been everywhere.

925
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:52,430
- Remember, we saw, like, 20.
- No! No, not that.

926
00:50:52,432 --> 00:50:54,800
The guy that I was telling you
about before,

927
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:55,667
he was in there,
he was fucking taunting me.

928
00:50:55,669 --> 00:50:57,702
He was banging
against the Plexiglas.

929
00:50:57,704 --> 00:50:58,803
Nat. Hey.

930
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,539
Look,
when Asher gets out,

931
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:01,673
we'll go find someplace else.

932
00:51:01,675 --> 00:51:02,841
Yeah. Just give him a second.

933
00:51:02,843 --> 00:51:05,443
Knowing him, he's probably
having the time of his life.

Hey, it's okay.
Just breathe.

943
00:52:30,687 --> 00:52:32,422
I'm just, like, I'm done.

944
00:52:32,424 --> 00:52:34,756
I know. You've made it through
the majority of the night.

945
00:52:34,758 --> 00:52:36,125
Of the fucking night?

946
00:52:36,127 --> 00:52:37,259
You've gotten through a lot,
all right?

947
00:52:37,261 --> 00:52:38,393
Fuck!

948
00:52:38,395 --> 00:52:39,731
Oh, shit!

00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,623
Fuck me!

You got Brundlefly'd!

That's awesome!

Well, that's kind of funny.

00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,333
Oh, really?
It's your shirt, so, fuck you.

955
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,868
Damn! Shut up!

956
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,437
Let's go to the bathroom.

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, shit!
This isn't how
I wanted the night to go.
It's just been a long time
since I've seen you
and I wanted it to be
like it used to be.

958
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,315
I knew this place
was gonna be creepy,

959
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:07,882
I just didn't know
it was gonna be that intense.

960
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,153
Right.

961
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:12,386
But, hey, are you...

962
00:53:12,388 --> 00:53:13,424
Are you good?

963
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,560
I just worry about you.

964
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,326
And I love you.

965
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:20,164
And I miss you.

966
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,199
I love you, too.

967
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,268
I'm sorry I haven't
been around lately.

968
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:27,304
We gotta see each other more.

969
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:30,574
Let's go to Spain.

970
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:32,875
- You're not serious.
- I'm serious.

971
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,275
We've always talked about it.

972
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:35,476
- Let's just do it.
- You wanna go to Spain?

973
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:36,545
Yeah, you said I need a break.

974
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:39,181
You're probably right. So...

975
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:41,449
You wanna go to the Prado
and get <i>tapas?</i>

976
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:42,784
Sounds like you're saying
"topless," but...

977
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,286
I mean, we can do that, too.

978
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:45,687
You can do that. No thanks.

979
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,223
We're going to Spain?

980
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:51,259
- Yeah.
- You promise?

981
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,496
I promise.

982
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,364
Okay.

983
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:56,364
Okay.

984
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:57,699
I'll meet you out there.

985
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,534
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

986
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:02,203
We're going to Spain.

987
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,508
We're going topless in Spain.

Ugh. Gross.

I'm calling the cops!

991
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,011
Fuck!

992
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:30,772
Brooke.

993
00:58:30,774 --> 00:58:31,873
What?

994
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:34,942
What's wrong?

995
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,212
Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you. It's empty.

996
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:39,214
No, I'm telling you
that he was just here!

997
00:58:39,216 --> 00:58:41,148
I just had to crawl under this
thing to get away from him!

998
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- He was grabbing at me!
- All right, look...
I know the scarers
aren't supposed
to be in the bathroom,
but if you can't even
identify him,
I don't know what
you want me to do.

999
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:49,757
I don't know. Shut down
the park. Call the cops.

1000
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,726
- Do something other than this!
- Are you hurt?

1001
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:54,062
- What?
- Did he physically hurt you?

1002
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:55,830
I mean, he grabbed at me.
I'm not injured.

1003
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,833
Unless there is
an actionable charge,

1004
00:58:57,835 --> 00:58:59,801
- there's nothing I can do.
- What?

1005
00:58:59,803 --> 00:59:01,569
No, you're not understanding
a thing that I'm saying!

1006
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:03,804
This guy has been stalking us
since the second we got here!

1007
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,473
- Which guy?
- The guy with the mask

1008
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,609
from the Night Bumps ride!

1009
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:09,610
You just described 15 people
that work in this park.

1010
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:11,212
You know how many complaints
I get like this a night?

1011
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,580
Great. Well, mine's valid,

1012
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:13,748
so what are you gonna
do with that?

1013
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,119
- Holy shit!
- What?

1014
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:19,020
It's the photos
of you and Gavin.

1015
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,621
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, no, no, wait.

1016
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:21,723
Who's Gavin?

1017
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:22,623
He's our friend that was

1018
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:23,991
supposed to meet us,
like, an hour ago.

1019
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:25,092
He must have Gavin's phone.

1020
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:28,529
Yeah, I think your friend,
Gavin, is pranking you.

1021
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:29,830
All right, look,

1022
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,600
you came here
to be scared, right?

1023
00:59:31,602 --> 00:59:34,235
I can't arrest people
for doing their job.

1024
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,772
Welcome to Hell Fest.

1025
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,176
We've got to find him.

1026
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:43,578
Quinn. Quinn, we need to go.

1027
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,779
- Now.
- What?

1028
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,114
- We need to go. Now.
- Why would we leave?

1029
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:47,781
I'll tell you later.
Where's Asher?

1030
00:59:47,783 --> 00:59:48,917
I haven't seen him.

1031
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,587
Then where's Taylor?

1032
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:53,221
She volunteered.

1033
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,683
Welcome,

1034
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:27,054
children of the night!

1035
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:30,058
Are you ready to leave

1036
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,826
the land of the living

1037
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:33,060
and enter

1038
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:35,830
into the darkness?

1039
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:40,203
Into the world of monsters?

1040
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:42,571
Whoo!

1041
01:00:42,573 --> 01:00:46,308
In order to open up
the gates of Hell,

1042
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,344
we must spill the blood of...

1043
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:51,045
Wait for it,

1044
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,183
wait for it,

1045
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,784
a virgin.

1046
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:03,223
So, about that
whole virgin thing,

1047
01:01:03,225 --> 01:01:04,826
I think we might have
a problem.

1048
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:06,328
What is your name, child?

1049
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,330
Taylor Ann Smythe, your honor.

1050
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:10,799
You're accused of doing
the Devil's work.

1051
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:12,033
What say you?

1052
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,668
- Totally did it.
- And what are your crimes?

1053
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:15,937
Well, how long
do you have?

1054
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:18,205
'Cause I've actually done laps
around the seven deadly sins.

1055
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,875
Oh! Impressive.

1056
01:01:21,877 --> 01:01:25,013
But you must pay
for your transgressions.

1057
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:26,016
Ooh, what is it?

1058
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,882
Your head.

1059
01:01:30,152 --> 01:01:31,187
Ooh.

1060
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:35,192
Executioner!

1061
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,229
Yeah!

1062
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,201
Oh. Okay. Well, bye-bye.

1063
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:48,005
- Something's not right.
- What?

1064
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:53,741
Something's not right.

1065
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:54,844
What do you mean?

1066
01:01:56,712 --> 01:01:58,013
Yeah!

1067
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,228
That's him.

1068
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,730
That's him.

1069
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,964
Wait, the guy
from the bathroom?

1070
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,266
Yeah, that's...

1071
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,235
That's him. Oh, God! Taylor!

1072
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,272
Nat, wait!

1073
01:02:38,754 --> 01:02:40,757
Taylor!

1074
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:42,993
Taylor!

1075
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:56,740
Nat, it's okay.
It's okay.

1076
01:03:02,846 --> 01:03:04,782
Oh, my God,
that was so much fun!

1077
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,449
Hell Fest!

1078
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:14,992
Hey, can someone get me
out of this thing?

1079
01:03:16,093 --> 01:03:17,357
Hey, you got her?

1080
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,195
Please exit
the stage area.

1081
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:25,967
Oh, hey. Sorry about the, uh,

1082
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:27,301
screaming girl.

1083
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,002
Yeah, that's my best friend's
best friend.

1084
01:03:29,004 --> 01:03:31,371
She doesn't really get horror,
so...

1085
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:32,877
What can you do?

1086
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:40,114
Can you get me out?

1087
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:41,185
Please?

1088
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,790
Yes! Awesome, thank you.

1089
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,458
Ow! What the hell, man?

1090
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,259
I said out, not forward.

1091
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,427
Ow!

1092
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:56,063
And not tighter. Dude, did you
just skip training day?

1093
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:58,533
'Cause you're really
not doing this right. It's...

1094
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:01,069
Okay, that's really tight.

1095
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:02,402
This isn't a funny joke.

1096
01:04:02,404 --> 01:04:04,038
Ow! Okay.

1097
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,973
Jesus, can you not hear
when I say "Ow"?

1098
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,107
This is not comfortable.

1099
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:08,912
Ow!

1100
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:11,846
Okay, too tight.

1101
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,047
This is really not funny.
I don't like this.

1102
01:04:14,049 --> 01:04:15,285
This is really uncomfortable.

1103
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,096
Brooke!

1104
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:28,295
Quinn!

1105
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,165
Somebody help me!

1106
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:31,299
Are you happy now?

1107
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:33,101
'Cause now we're gonna have
to call the cops on you.

1108
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:34,536
Yeah, no, that's exactly what
I want you to do!

1109
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:35,770
Two of our friends
are missing!

1110
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:37,404
No, two of your friends are
somewhere in the park, drunk.

1111
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:38,473
No, they're not!

1112
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:39,477
Help me!

1113
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:43,844
Shit! Quinn!

1114
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,248
Come on!

1115
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,449
Oh, my God, someone help!

1116
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:53,223
Help me!

1117
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:19,273
Help me, please!

1118
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:20,440
Please help me! Please!

1119
01:06:20,442 --> 01:06:23,043
- Help me!
- You suck at this shit!

1120
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,913
- Guys, I think it's Taylor.
- Who's...

1121
01:06:24,915 --> 01:06:26,617
- Hey, where are you...
- Fuck out of my way!

1122
01:06:28,018 --> 01:06:30,051
We got a situation
in the Deadlands.

1123
01:06:30,053 --> 01:06:31,551
He's trying to
kill me! Get out of the way!

1124
01:06:31,553 --> 01:06:32,987
Get out of the way!

1125
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,554
Somebody, help me,
please! Help me!

1126
01:06:34,556 --> 01:06:35,556
Please help me! Please!

1127
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,125
Get out of the way,
he's trying to kill me!

1128
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:39,330
What are you doing? Don't...

1129
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,600
Hey, man, what are you doing?

1130
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,477
- Quinn, Quinn!
- Brooke. Brooke. Brooke!

1131
01:06:57,547 --> 01:06:59,980
- Quinn! No!
- We gotta go.

1132
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:01,451
Brooke, we gotta go.

1133
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,170
Get down on the ground!

1134
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,107
We got him! Got him!

1135
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:38,485
- Nat! Are you okay? You okay?
- Yeah.

1136
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,457
<i>Please find the nearest exit.</i>

1137
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,503

Come on, we gotta go.

- Nat, over here.
- Okay.

01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,493

- Wait, wait, wait.
- What? What?

1160
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:03,463
Look, these are triggering
the rooms.

1161
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:05,165
This is what's making
the noise.

1162
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:06,601
- Come with me.
- No. Nat.

1163
01:10:06,603 --> 01:10:07,735
Brooke, I'm telling you...

1164
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:08,902
We gotta go that way.

1165
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,607
Shh, listen, you have

1166
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,273

Okay, come on.

Come on.
There's a closet back here.

Yeah.

I won't tell anybody!
Please!

1215
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,120
No! Wait, wait!
Please!

1216
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:54,324
No!

1217
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:01,163
Go to Hell!

1218
01:20:16,746 --> 01:20:18,011
Hey, back up!

1219
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:19,512
He was
right behind us.

1220
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:01,357
We looked everywhere,
but we couldn't find him.

1221
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:04,294
Wait, what?

1222
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:08,765
No, no, no,
he was right there.

1223
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:12,502
Don't worry. We're gonna
keep looking, okay?

1224
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:28,080
<i>They're gonna find him.</i>

1225
01:21:28,082 --> 01:21:30,183
<i>Tragedy at Hell Fest tonight.</i>

1226
01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:31,919
<i>Police believe
that the suspect</i>

1227
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:33,920
<i>may have entered
the park anonymously</i>

1228
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:35,222
<i>with the rest
of the attendees.</i>

1229
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:37,456
<i>Four fatalities
have been confirmed</i>

1230
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:39,392
<i>with two of the bodies
being hidden</i>

1231
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,928
<i>within mazes inside the park.</i>

1232
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:44,231
<i>All of this leads police
to connect tonight's murders</i>

1233
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,900
<i>to the killing of a girl
at an Orange Grove haunt</i>

1234
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,569
<i>just a few years ago.</i>

1235
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:50,340
<i>If you're just tuning in,
tragedy...</i>

1236
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:09,485
Daddy, you're home!

1237
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:13,488
Did you bring me anything?
