1
00:02:17,923 --> 00:02:20,389
...this inditement is only one of
a series to be handed down...

2
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,461
as result of the respectful
rangery investigation.

3
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:28,030
Grave robbing, in Texas, is this
hour top news story...

4
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:31,399
and informant led officers at
Marto County sheriff department...

5
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,935
to a cemetery, just outside
the small Texas community of Newt...

6
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:36,538
...early this morning.

7
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,341
Officers there discovered what
appeared to be a grizzly work of art...

8
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:44,543
the remains of a badly decomposed body,
wired to a large monument.

9
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:46,979
A second body was found
in the ditch near...

10
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,582
the perimeter of the cemetery,
subsequent investigation has revealed...

11
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:52,850
at least a dozen empty crypts.

12
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:56,421
And it's clear more will turn up
as the probe continues.

13
00:02:56,521 --> 00:03:00,622
Deputies report that in some instances,
only parts of the corpses have been removed.

14
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,124
The head, or in some cases...

15
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,231
the extremities removed, and...

16
00:03:04,332 --> 00:03:06,762
the remainder of the corpse left
intact. Evidence indicates...

17
00:03:06,863 --> 00:03:10,209
the robberies have occurred
over a period of time.

18
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,900
Sheriff Jesús Maldonado
refuses to give details...

19
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,171
in this case and said only...

20
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:17,695
that he did have a strong
evidence linking the crime to...

21
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:22,075
elements outside the state.
Area residents have reportedly...

22
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:24,609
converged on the cemetery
claiming the remains of relatives

23
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,135
have been removed.

24
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:29,693
No suspects are in custody, as
investigation at the scene...

25
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:31,116
continues.

26
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:58,029
...mental hospital and released.
A 16-story-building downtown...

27
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,611
Atlanta, collapsed today, killing
at least 29 persons.

28
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:07,435
The engineering firm responsible
could offer no explanation for...

29
00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:11,081
the collapse although the
construction firm say there's...

30
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:15,438
no logical reason for the
collapse is suspected sabotage.

31
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:18,442
Police in Gary, Indiana, have
been unable to identify the...

32
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:21,839
bodies of a young man...

33
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:28,647
and four children
who had their features carved away,

34
00:05:28,748 --> 00:05:30,934
the man's dimples had been removed.

35
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,555
Police first identified
the victims as 2 women...

36
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:39,458
continuing the program of the
government to overwhelm reaches...

37
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:42,495
beyond the Amazon today are
ruptured into violence...

38
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:48,057
Forces of at least three South America
governments already have been involved...

39
00:05:51,203 --> 00:05:55,406
...this territory it tells it's
sketchy and yet none of...

40
00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:59,109
the governments is involved
as its knowledge to a war.

41
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,433
...Police in Dallas arrested a
young couple today...

42
00:06:02,534 --> 00:06:04,916
complaints by neighbors led
them to discover a 18-month-old

43
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:06,552
daughter the couple...

44
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:11,595
chained in the attic of a
dilapidated house...

45
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:21,197
Franklin!

46
00:06:32,554 --> 00:06:34,149
Are you ok?

47
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:44,106
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take...

48
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:47,857
- much more of this.
- The condition of retro gradation...

49
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,139
is contrary or inharmonious to the
regular direction of actual...

50
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,152
movement in the zodiac, and is,
in that respect, evil.

51
00:06:54,253 --> 00:06:57,667
Hint: When malefic planets are in
retrograde, and Saturn is malefic...

52
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:01,386
their maleficies are increased.

53
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,265
Have you been doing that Reader's
Digest worth our...

54
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,643
Jerry, it just means Saturn's a bad
influence. It's just particularly...

55
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:10,694
bad influence now, because
it's in retrograde.

56
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:14,499
Hey, man, do you believe all that
stuff your old lady is talking me?

57
00:07:33,163 --> 00:07:35,740
My granddaddy is buried here. Can
we find out if anything happened?

58
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:38,053
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- See that big heavy fella...

59
00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:41,836
standing with that big flashlight,
isn't that the sheriff?

60
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:44,947
You go tell him your granddaddy is
buried in there. He'll let you in.

61
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,498
Ok. Thank you.

62
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:49,258
Hey, fella, I'm gonna
run off to...

63
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:51,903
- meet him if you don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.

64
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:55,481
- Hey, folks. Let us go see where...

65
00:07:55,582 --> 00:07:58,207
her granddaddy's buried.

66
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:05,781
Things happen here about
they don't tell about.

67
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:09,156
I see things.

68
00:08:11,632 --> 00:08:17,863
You see, they say it's just an old
man talking.

69
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,176
You laugh at an old man...

70
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:27,975
this thing that laughs
knows better.

71
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:37,859
Yes, they're sure. The man said the
Tallman's grave had been dug up.

72
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,363
Mama, don't worry.
I saw it myself!

73
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:44,054
It didn't look dug up to me.

74
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:50,797
What's that? What smell?

75
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:55,637
What is that stench?

76
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,485
Hey. That's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used...

77
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:10,058
to sell his cattle! We got an uncle
that works in one of those places...

78
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,829
outside of Fortworth. See those
buildings there? That's where...

79
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,400
they kill him. They bash'em in the
head with a big sledgehammer!

80
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:20,899
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill him.

81
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:38,321
It'd start squealing and freaking
out, they'd have to...

82
00:09:38,422 --> 00:09:40,589
come up and bash'em 2 or 3 times.

83
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,960
They'd scatter them before
they were even dead.

84
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:48,130
That's horrible! People shouldn't
kill animals for food.

85
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:52,035
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they get this big air gun...

86
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:55,398
that shoots a bullet into the skull
and then retracts it.

87
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:01,011
Franklin, I like me, please
change the subject.

88
00:10:01,112 --> 00:10:03,668
That smell's still going on.

89
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:09,809
Oh, man! It's hot in here.

90
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,294
- Hitchhiker!
- Should we take him up?

91
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:19,863
Yeah man, pick him up.
He'll asphyxiate out there!

92
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:21,597
- What does he look like?
- The son of a bitch 's gonna...

93
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:24,802
- smell like the slaughterhouse.
- Give the guy a break. He can...

94
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:26,870
- sit by Franklin.
- What do you wanna do?

95
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:30,233
- He's weird looking, no.

96
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:54,653
- I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where're you heading, man?

97
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,236
- You work at that place?
- Don't.

98
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:01,963
- How did you get stuck out here?

99
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:05,309
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- I got an uncle that works...

100
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,979
- at a slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.

101
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,511
My grandfather, too.

102
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:14,051
My family's always been in beef.

103
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:16,947
The whole family are cracked.
Hey man, did you go into that...

104
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:21,325
slaughter room or whatever
they call it?

105
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:24,163
Where they shoot the cattle
with that air gun thing?

106
00:11:24,264 --> 00:11:27,332
- That gun is no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.

107
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:31,336
With the sledge!
That was better.

108
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:34,405
- They died better that way.
- How come? I thought the gun...

109
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:36,509
- was better.
- Oh no. With the new way...

110
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:42,147
- people were put out of jobs.

111
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:44,941
- You do that?
- Look!

112
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:54,727
- I was the killer!
- Let me see them.

113
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:58,230
- They don't seem to head your way.
- You took these, huh?

114
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:00,264
- Yeah!
- Franklin.

115
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:04,504
- Let me see.
- They make hitches...

116
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:14,048
They take the head and they boil,
except for the tongue, and scrape...

117
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:18,173
all the flesh away from the bone.

118
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:21,054
They use everything,
they throw nothing away.

119
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:26,392
They use jaws, muscles, and
the eyes, and the ligaments...

120
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:28,996
- and everything!
- Look at this.

121
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:33,834
- They boil the nose and the gums
down to a big jelly of fat.

122
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:36,503
I don't know it was in that stuff.

123
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:39,539
It's really good. Do you like it?

124
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,811
- Yeah, I like it. It's good!
- It sounds horrible. Can't we...

125
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:47,514
- talk about something else?
- You'd probably like it if you...

126
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:49,650
didn't know what was in it.

127
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:52,376
I wouldn't and I wish you'd
stop talking about it.

128
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:56,413
Take it before everybody's sick.

129
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,306
What are you doing?

130
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:19,975
Look. I think that might hurt.

131
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,049
Oh, come on!

132
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,792
What are you doing to yourself?

133
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,826
Oh, what are you doing?

134
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:46,931
Nice, man!

135
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:10,663
I have this knife.

136
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:13,866
Put that away, too.

137
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:20,897
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man. Put it back.

138
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,185
You took my picture!

139
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:10,627
You can take me to my house.
I live right off this road.

140
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:14,753
I don't know, man.
We're in much of a hurry.

141
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:18,403
- How close is it?
- It's real close.

142
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:23,507
Couldn't you just walk? I mean...
If it's so close.

143
00:15:23,608 --> 00:15:27,345
You could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese. My brother...

144
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:30,148
- makes it real good. You'll like it.
- I think we'd better push on, man.

145
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:36,115
Don't we, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry...

146
00:15:57,877 --> 00:16:03,015
- It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.

147
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:05,083
- You can pay me now.
- Huh?

148
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:07,852
- 2 dollars. It's a good picture.
- No, man. Franklin...

149
00:16:07,953 --> 00:16:11,613
give him back that picture.

150
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:46,886
I'm about to freak. Call a cop.

151
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:50,250
That's the last damn hitchhiker
I ever take.

152
00:17:56,564 --> 00:17:59,553
- Listen to Franklin's horoscope:
- I'm sorry.

153
00:18:02,004 --> 00:18:04,172
Travel in the countryside.

154
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:08,009
Long range plans,
upsetting persons...

155
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,180
around you, could make this a
disturbing and unpredictable day.

156
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:16,618
The events in the world are not
doing much, to cheer one up.

157
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:19,220
- That's just perfect!
- Franklin, I think you'll be alright.

158
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:23,914
Hey, Kat, read Alex's. He's
Capricorn.

159
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:33,064
Oh, no.

160
00:18:33,503 --> 00:18:38,574
Capricorn is ruled by Saturn.
There are moments where we...

161
00:18:38,675 --> 00:18:41,310
cannot believe that what's
happening is really true...

162
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:45,401
pinch yourself and you may
find out that it is.

163
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:17,907
Hurry up.

164
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:27,950
Here comes somebody.

165
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,723
How are you?

166
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:40,427
Would you fill her up, please?

167
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,995
I got no gas.

168
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:47,444
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty. Transport won't...

169
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:50,681
be here until this afternoon.

170
00:19:50,782 --> 00:19:53,584
Maybe not even until
tomorrow morning.

171
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:57,743
Hey, you know where "The Old
Franklin Place" is?

172
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:05,763
- "The Old Franklin Place"?
- It's an old 2-story house and...

173
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:09,032
it's sitting up on the hill. I think
you have to turn on the road...

174
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:11,928
back there,
but I'm not real sure.

175
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:16,502
Maybe I've seen something like
that up there. But look, you boys...

176
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:22,480
don't wanna go messing around
an old house.

177
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:25,718
Those things are dangerous,
you're bound to get hurt!

178
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,453
- We'll be careful.
- Don't wanna go fooling around...

179
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:32,591
other folk's property. Some folks
don't like it.

180
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:34,525
They don't mind
showing you.

181
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:37,663
- My father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?

182
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:39,457
- Yeah.
- Look...

183
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:44,737
I got barbecue here. Why don't
you stay a while?

184
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:48,396
The transport will be by
in a little while...

185
00:20:50,243 --> 00:20:53,209
I can go and get some barbecue.

186
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,850
Them girls, they don't wanna go
messing around an old house.

187
00:20:57,951 --> 00:21:00,678
Best you stick around here.

188
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:14,734
We should've asked him if there's
another gas station around here.

189
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:17,801
Don't you think he would have told
us if there was?

190
00:21:18,138 --> 00:21:23,129
- It wouldn't hurt to ask.
- I'll go ask.

191
00:21:27,181 --> 00:21:30,511
What the hell, we should have
stopped back there for gas.

192
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:33,775
Go, damn it.
There.

193
00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:36,447
You think this place has
room service?

194
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,591
Franklin, you're cutting the van!

195
00:21:42,296 --> 00:21:46,161
Yeah, I just started doing that.

196
00:21:49,637 --> 00:21:55,708
I bet this is some of that guy's
blood. Look at that.

197
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:59,332
- Think it's his blood?
- I guess so.

198
00:22:01,116 --> 00:22:05,709
That's blood, alright. And I got
cut the hell out of him, chef.

199
00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:09,587
You think you could do that
to yourself?

200
00:22:09,858 --> 00:22:11,950
Crazy?

201
00:22:13,862 --> 00:22:18,796
It takes something, though, I mean,
do that to yourself, like he did.

202
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:24,962
You think I said something that
made him mad?

203
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,898
- What?
- Franklin, you're crazy as he was.

204
00:22:33,515 --> 00:22:38,314
Hey, I got us some barbecue.
Newt's the closest place to get gas.

205
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:48,731
We're going to that Granpa's place.
There's a creek, you can go swimming.

206
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:52,367
Come on, Sally, we're going to
that Granpa's place!

207
00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:56,071
- Let's go.
- Hey, that guy smeared blood...

208
00:22:56,172 --> 00:23:01,476
- all over the van.
- Let's not waste time to wipe this up.

209
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:05,271
What? What did you do?
You're in someone's van?

210
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:28,600
Let me see your knife.

211
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:33,433
Thank you.

212
00:23:39,816 --> 00:23:42,518
Franklin, if we run out of gas
before we get back to that service...

213
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:45,847
station, you're towing us back
in that chair.

214
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,792
Hey...

215
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:59,870
You think that guy was just trying
to scare us by blowing out...

216
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,834
my picture like that?

217
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,044
Oh, look, they let the place
fall apart.

218
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,418
Put it over there.

219
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,151
- Wanna go over there?
- Let's go.

220
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,858
Oh, Kirk, come on!

221
00:25:07,307 --> 00:25:09,829
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

222
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:16,771
I want to see the smear
the guy made.

223
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:27,259
This is weird.
I wonder if that means something.

224
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,661
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's gonna get you.

225
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:33,957
- Why don't you wash it off, ok?
- I want to see inside.

226
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,061
- Jerry!
- Ok!

227
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:40,928
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

228
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:45,744
- Get it. You wash it up.
- You don't think that guy...

229
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:49,278
- is trying to follow us, do you?
- What for?

230
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:04,789
Where's my knife?
Kirk?

231
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:08,601
Looks like it must have been
a nursery room.

232
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:12,473
This was my room. I got to stay
here until I was 8 years old.

233
00:26:12,574 --> 00:26:15,341
- Until my grandmother died.
- What happened?

234
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:19,637
- To my grandmother?
- Yeah, she died.

235
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:56,450
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- I think it's seen better days...

236
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:59,320
These animals would to put me to
sleep when I was a little girl.

237
00:26:59,421 --> 00:27:03,412
Look at the zebra. I had this
fascination for the zebras...

238
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:04,916
Kate?

239
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:33,343
Sally!

240
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:45,691
Come on, Franklin!
It's gonna be a fun trip.

241
00:28:53,771 --> 00:28:58,603
If I have any more fun today,
I don't think I'll take it!

242
00:29:17,496 --> 00:29:20,962
- Hey, Franklin!
- What's wrong?

243
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:24,895
Didn't you say there was a
swimming well out here?

244
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:29,764
Pam and I would like to go
swimming in there.

245
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:35,871
There used to be a trail down
between those two old sheds.

246
00:29:36,616 --> 00:29:37,774
Come on.

247
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,844
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- We'll see them in an hour or so.

248
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:51,815
Yeah. See them down in
about an hour or so.

249
00:30:11,078 --> 00:30:15,376
Sally!
Sally...

250
00:30:33,262 --> 00:30:35,954
Seed growing in the world...

251
00:30:36,565 --> 00:30:39,553
I don't want to miss it.

252
00:30:42,003 --> 00:30:45,332
Man, a scorpion,
there's a scorpion!

253
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:58,104
Crap!

254
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:03,747
This must be it!

255
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,014
Are you ok?

256
00:31:08,123 --> 00:31:10,991
What the hell, Franklin would never
get down here anyway.

257
00:31:11,092 --> 00:31:14,060
I bet he must have when
he was little.

258
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:17,319
Franklin never was little.

259
00:31:25,939 --> 00:31:27,699
Gasoline.

260
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:32,007
I can leave my guitar, you know,
I'd give him a couple of bucks...

261
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:35,378
We gotta come back by here anyway,
I can pick up my guitar and...

262
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:37,613
give him a couple more dollars
and we get more gas...

263
00:31:37,714 --> 00:31:40,649
He won't want your guitar,
he's not gonna sell us some gas...

264
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,112
let's just go back now.

265
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:28,910
Hey, come here!
Come here, look at this.

266
00:32:54,709 --> 00:32:56,604
- A generator!
- What?

267
00:32:57,011 --> 00:33:00,476
A generator! For electricity!

268
00:33:02,515 --> 00:33:06,003
Hey, hello! Is there anybody
in the house?

269
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:52,709
Hello! Is anybody home?

270
00:34:13,607 --> 00:34:16,401
I got something for you.

271
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:23,937
Let's go!

272
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:29,506
Hello?

273
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:32,918
Hello?

274
00:34:43,163 --> 00:34:46,560
- Come look at this!
- Let's go!

275
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:50,355
Hello!

276
00:34:54,673 --> 00:34:55,762
Anybody home?

277
00:34:57,908 --> 00:34:58,769
Hello?

278
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:11,579
Hey, Pam!

279
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:20,581
Hello!

280
00:35:44,379 --> 00:35:45,434
Kirk!

281
00:35:59,692 --> 00:36:00,987
Kirk!

282
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,627
Kirk!

283
00:36:20,241 --> 00:36:21,136
Kirk?

284
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:46,523
Kirk!

285
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,391
Kirk?

286
00:37:00,775 --> 00:37:01,500
Kirk?

287
00:40:28,575 --> 00:40:30,910
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
He's coming to get you!

288
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,944
You don't think it means anything?

289
00:40:33,045 --> 00:40:35,580
We'll protect you if
he tries to get you.

290
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:39,409
- Maybe it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.

291
00:40:41,252 --> 00:40:45,446
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- You worry too much.

292
00:40:46,455 --> 00:40:50,393
He couldn't find us, anyway.
He doesn't even know our names.

293
00:40:50,494 --> 00:40:53,228
I gave him your name, Franklin.
And I told him where you lived.

294
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:56,130
I even gave him your ZIP code.
He's gonna kill you.

295
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:57,195
Jerry...

296
00:40:58,232 --> 00:41:01,734
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.

297
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:04,904
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife, remember?

298
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:07,401
When did you have it last?

299
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:12,376
I didn't have it last.
You had it last.

300
00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:14,778
I gave it to you, remember?
What did you do with it?

301
00:41:14,879 --> 00:41:17,080
I don't know. Didn't I
give it back to you?

302
00:41:17,181 --> 00:41:20,349
No, I didn't have it when I got
out of the van.

303
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:24,177
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right. I'll look for it.

304
00:41:25,288 --> 00:41:28,122
Listen, I think I'll walk down to
the creek before it gets too dark.

305
00:41:28,223 --> 00:41:29,923
How do I get there, Frank?

306
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:33,649
Well, there's a trail down there.
Between the two old sheds.

307
00:41:34,261 --> 00:41:37,784
- Can I go too?
- I think you'd better stay here.

308
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:40,061
All right.

309
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,166
I can't find it.

310
00:41:57,714 --> 00:42:02,944
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

311
00:42:05,854 --> 00:42:08,819
You really are mad, huh?

312
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,113
I don't blame you.

313
00:42:13,327 --> 00:42:14,689
Kirk!

314
00:42:25,571 --> 00:42:29,038
You really didn't want me
to come, did you?

315
00:42:29,139 --> 00:42:35,004
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.

316
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:43,050
Did you believe all that stuff
Pam was telling about?

317
00:42:43,151 --> 00:42:46,318
Saturn, and retrograde,
and all that?

318
00:42:46,419 --> 00:42:51,183
I don't know. Everything means
something, I guess.

319
00:42:56,161 --> 00:42:59,328
You don't think that guy is
trying to follow us, do you?

320
00:42:59,429 --> 00:43:02,520
I mean, there's no way
that he could follow us.

321
00:43:06,236 --> 00:43:09,201
He'd probably find
Kirk and kill him.

322
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:19,300
- Sally...
- What now?

323
00:43:22,482 --> 00:43:23,913
Nothing.

324
00:43:26,753 --> 00:43:28,650
Never mind.

325
00:43:34,024 --> 00:43:35,249
Kirk!

326
00:44:05,616 --> 00:44:07,171
Hello?

327
00:44:10,987 --> 00:44:12,509
Is anybody home?

328
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:21,455
Excuse me, I'm looking for
some friends. Hello?

329
00:44:26,434 --> 00:44:28,194
Is anybody here?

330
00:44:31,704 --> 00:44:32,668
Damn.

331
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:54,442
Kirk!
Are you guys in there?

332
00:44:58,226 --> 00:45:02,216
Hey, guys! Quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.

333
00:45:10,336 --> 00:45:12,325
Pam, is that you?

334
00:45:16,142 --> 00:45:17,834
Okay, you guys!

335
00:45:21,811 --> 00:45:25,869
Come on out.
Come on!

336
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,882
Kirk?

337
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

338
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:40,990
They must be lost. They don't
have a flashlight or anything.

339
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:44,459
If they 're not back in a minute,
we'd better go look for them

340
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,582
What if we get lost, too?

341
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,832
Sally, we ought to go to that
gas station and get help.

342
00:47:51,933 --> 00:47:54,989
I'm not leaving here
without Jerry.

343
00:47:55,969 --> 00:47:57,661
Jerry!

344
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:03,796
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

345
00:48:05,711 --> 00:48:09,075
Jerry!

346
00:48:10,214 --> 00:48:11,235
Jerry!

347
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:13,879
Hey!

348
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:22,013
They'll probably be back
in a minute or so.

349
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:26,951
Sally, we ought to go
to that gas station.

350
00:48:29,163 --> 00:48:30,525
Sally...

351
00:48:32,299 --> 00:48:34,888
I think we ought to go.

352
00:48:37,936 --> 00:48:40,867
Are the keys in the van?

353
00:48:42,373 --> 00:48:44,941
Could I see the flashlight
for a minute?

354
00:48:45,042 --> 00:48:46,506
What for?

355
00:48:47,077 --> 00:48:49,745
Let me see the flashlight.
I'm gonna go look for them.

356
00:48:49,846 --> 00:48:51,147
You don't have to go.

357
00:48:51,248 --> 00:48:53,448
Sally, no, I don't think that's
a good idea, Sally.

358
00:48:53,549 --> 00:48:56,013
I don't think you ought to go.

359
00:48:56,284 --> 00:48:58,852
Look, I'm gonna honk
the horn one more time.

360
00:48:58,953 --> 00:49:03,424
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No, I'm gonna honk the horn...

361
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:07,926
and we will wait a minute, and
they will come and we will go.

362
00:49:08,027 --> 00:49:09,048
All right?

363
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,469
Sally, they took the keys!
We don't have any keys!

364
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:20,625
They took the keys!

365
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:24,330
Stop it!
Stop it!

366
00:49:26,409 --> 00:49:31,346
- Now give me the flashlight!
- No, Sally! You can't go!

367
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:33,847
What if they came back
and we weren't here?

368
00:49:33,948 --> 00:49:37,317
- Franklin, give me that flashlight!
- I'll keep the flashlight!

369
00:49:37,418 --> 00:49:40,486
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right! All right!

370
00:49:40,587 --> 00:49:42,921
I'll go with you. I'll go
with you, all right?

371
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:46,523
I'll go with you, but I'll
keep the flashlight.

372
00:49:46,624 --> 00:49:49,527
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.

373
00:49:49,628 --> 00:49:52,329
I can't push you down the hill!

374
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:53,519
Sally...

375
00:49:56,199 --> 00:50:00,758
- Look, I'll go with you...
- Never mind, I'll go without it.

376
00:50:01,938 --> 00:50:06,871
All right. Sally, wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.

377
00:50:07,275 --> 00:50:10,576
Sally! Hold on a minute now.

378
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:12,336
All right, let's go.

379
00:50:12,813 --> 00:50:15,505
Let's go, I'll go with you.

380
00:50:16,316 --> 00:50:18,651
Sally, I can't keep up with you!

381
00:50:18,752 --> 00:50:19,841
Sally!

382
00:50:20,686 --> 00:50:23,378
Sally, wait a minute!

383
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:30,322
Hold on!

384
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:43,168
Jerry!

385
00:50:43,537 --> 00:50:44,432
Jerry!

386
00:50:52,379 --> 00:50:57,540
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

387
00:50:58,549 --> 00:51:01,880
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

388
00:51:09,959 --> 00:51:12,514
I thought I heard something.

389
00:51:13,095 --> 00:51:14,559
There's a light!

390
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:16,258
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

391
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,423
- It looks like a house.
- Come on, push!

392
00:51:32,744 --> 00:51:37,109
- It's a house!
- I can't see it very well.

393
00:51:37,449 --> 00:51:42,780
- Franklin, this is impossible.
- Come on, Sally!

394
00:51:43,419 --> 00:51:46,179
Get back and push, damn!

395
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:48,248
Impossible!

396
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:56,650
I heard something over there!

397
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:04,028
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!

398
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Sally, I hear something.
Stop! Stop!

399
00:54:20,346 --> 00:54:21,935
Help!

400
00:54:30,853 --> 00:54:33,444
Help me!

401
00:54:58,811 --> 00:55:00,936
Help!

402
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:14,116
Help me, please!

403
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:10,296
- Help! Help!
- Whoa! Whoa!

404
00:58:10,397 --> 00:58:15,229
- Help me! Help me!
- Come over here!

405
00:58:17,705 --> 00:58:20,739
You're all right, girl.
Okay?

406
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,465
Hold on, take it easy, all right?

407
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:26,749
He killed...

408
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:31,146
- Take it easy...
- He killed Franklin...

409
00:58:31,247 --> 00:58:32,537
Call the police!

410
00:58:34,072 --> 00:58:35,327
Jerry!

411
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:39,257
I don't know what happened
to the others...

412
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:41,751
There's nobody out there now!

413
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:45,332
Take it easy!
Take it easy!

414
00:58:45,543 --> 00:58:46,697
What happened?

415
00:58:47,538 --> 00:58:53,048
- Call the police...
- There's no phone here.

416
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:59,170
We have to drive to the sheriff's.

417
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:02,365
Take it easy. Take it easy.

418
00:59:02,466 --> 00:59:04,050
I'll get the truck.

419
00:59:04,527 --> 00:59:09,640
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- Don't go! Don't go!

420
00:59:17,028 --> 00:59:19,720
The weather is expected to
continue warm and clear...

421
00:59:19,821 --> 00:59:20,807
and partially cloudy tomorrow...

422
00:59:20,908 --> 00:59:27,177
with no chance of precipitation.
Expected high of 90 °F.

423
00:59:27,278 --> 00:59:31,342
Our current temperature is 96°.
Winds blow southeast at 3 ml/h.

424
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:35,049
Community 98, kilometer 29.9.

425
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:37,540
Acting on a typical day
with some news...

426
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:40,176
the word is that the sheriff's
office began an investigation...

427
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:42,606
early this morning in the
County Cemetery.

428
00:59:42,707 --> 00:59:46,195
Opening crypts and muslins
where there was evidence of...

429
00:59:46,296 --> 00:59:49,611
tampering, The Sheriff found
a reported dozen coffins were...

430
00:59:49,712 --> 00:59:52,337
robbed a part of its contents.
According to the sheriff, Rhesus...

431
00:59:52,438 --> 00:59:55,095
Maldonado, there are ones
from which only the head and...

432
00:59:55,196 --> 00:59:57,854
extremities are removed,
and others

433
00:59:57,955 --> 01:00:00,173
and others from which only a
hand or foot removed, with the...

434
01:00:00,274 --> 01:00:07,416
remainder of the cadaver left
intact. Maldonado linked...

435
01:00:34,402 --> 01:00:36,335
What are you doing?

436
01:00:36,772 --> 01:00:39,533
- You will come with me...
- No!

437
01:00:43,881 --> 01:00:49,909
- What do you want?
- There's no need to do that...

438
01:00:50,057 --> 01:00:52,784
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

439
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:02,074
I had to lock up and
get the lights off.

440
01:03:02,175 --> 01:03:05,972
Because electricity is enough to
drive a man out of business.

441
01:03:35,454 --> 01:03:40,048
I hope you're not too
uncomfortable down there.

442
01:03:43,264 --> 01:03:47,269
You got nothing to worry about.
Just take it easy.

443
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:51,065
We're gonna get there soon.

444
01:03:52,811 --> 01:03:55,540
No, no, no.

445
01:03:56,716 --> 01:03:59,876
There's no need to do that.

446
01:04:27,126 --> 01:04:31,230
We always do our best.

447
01:04:31,331 --> 01:04:32,489
Hang on.

448
01:04:36,204 --> 01:04:37,191
No.

449
01:04:41,946 --> 01:04:43,913
Half witch.

450
01:04:48,989 --> 01:04:50,614
You little shit!

451
01:04:58,668 --> 01:05:02,006
You knock-head idiot!

452
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:05,544
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.

453
01:05:05,645 --> 01:05:08,874
You damn fool!
You almost got caught.

454
01:05:09,216 --> 01:05:12,454
No! They didn't see me.
They don't know nothing!

455
01:05:12,555 --> 01:05:16,318
I told you to stay away
from that graveyard.

456
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:56,367
I told you...

457
01:05:57,016 --> 01:06:02,324
I told you never to leave
your brother alone!

458
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:07,019
Get that girl out of the car!
Get her out!

459
01:06:11,202 --> 01:06:15,000
I hope your brother didn't let any
of those kids get away.

460
01:06:22,117 --> 01:06:26,450
Look at what your brother did
to that door!

461
01:06:35,803 --> 01:06:38,965
You let her go!

462
01:06:40,343 --> 01:06:42,572
You goddamn idiot!

463
01:07:06,078 --> 01:07:09,671
I thought you were in a hurry.

464
01:07:13,222 --> 01:07:16,246
Where are the kids?
Where are the children?

465
01:07:20,365 --> 01:07:21,887
Did they get away?

466
01:07:23,703 --> 01:07:25,362
Are you sure?

467
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:31,776
You...

468
01:07:33,248 --> 01:07:37,513
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!

469
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:50,306
Hey, come here! Look!
See how nice she looks!

470
01:07:50,407 --> 01:07:53,806
Get upstairs and get
your grandpa!

471
01:08:10,568 --> 01:08:14,173
Take it easy there, huh?

472
01:08:14,274 --> 01:08:18,106
You'll stay here for
a few minutes.

473
01:08:19,915 --> 01:08:22,144
Get back in there!

474
01:08:25,521 --> 01:08:27,715
To the chamber!

475
01:08:33,165 --> 01:08:36,028
You just take it easy.

476
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:41,471
We'll have something
to eat right away.

477
01:09:09,316 --> 01:09:11,145
Hey, you two!

478
01:09:11,687 --> 01:09:14,482
Give me a hand
with grandpa!

479
01:10:09,465 --> 01:10:11,021
Look, grandpa! Look!

480
01:12:25,589 --> 01:12:26,918
Knock it off!

481
01:12:27,624 --> 01:12:32,497
Quiet! You act like a pack
of hounds.

482
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:37,470
- We're just having fun!
- You think this is a party?

483
01:12:37,571 --> 01:12:43,245
Please!
You can make them stop!

484
01:12:43,346 --> 01:12:47,974
- No shit?
- Shut your mouth!

485
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,624
Can't be helped, young lady.

486
01:12:51,725 --> 01:12:56,319
Please! You can't let them
kill me!

487
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,669
He likes this face.

488
01:13:18,928 --> 01:13:24,236
He's crazy!
You gotta make him stop!

489
01:13:24,337 --> 01:13:25,666
Please...

490
01:13:26,373 --> 01:13:32,207
- He's just a cook!
- Shut up, you bitch hog!

491
01:13:33,314 --> 01:13:36,253
He always does all the work.

492
01:13:36,354 --> 01:13:39,189
He don't like it. Is that right?
You're just a cook!

493
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,721
Shut your mouth!

494
01:13:42,795 --> 01:13:45,565
You don't understand nothing.

495
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:49,938
I understand you ain't nothing!
We do all the work!

496
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:53,563
I just can take no
pleasure in killing.

497
01:13:57,114 --> 01:14:01,420
It's just something we gotta do.
It don't mean you have to like it.

498
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:02,508
Please...

499
01:14:03,124 --> 01:14:04,350
Please...

500
01:14:10,366 --> 01:14:15,029
I'll do anything you want.

501
01:15:17,993 --> 01:15:20,630
You don't need to torture the girl.

502
01:15:20,731 --> 01:15:23,200
Please, shut up. Remember
you're just a cook.

503
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:25,562
Let me and him handle this.

504
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,503
I won't have this.

505
01:15:31,413 --> 01:15:36,440
We ain't in no hurry.
And you ain't going no place.

506
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:40,979
You don't hear me?
I heard you told me much.

507
01:15:43,662 --> 01:15:48,324
No sense in waiting.
I gotta go to my room.

508
01:15:49,338 --> 01:15:53,075
I'll take her to grandpa.

509
01:15:53,176 --> 01:15:55,011
Grandpa'll have some fun.

510
01:15:55,112 --> 01:15:56,846
You always said he was the best.

511
01:15:56,947 --> 01:15:59,451
He's the best all right.

512
01:15:59,552 --> 01:16:03,824
Let's let him half leg.
Grandpa, we're gonna let you...

513
01:16:03,925 --> 01:16:05,288
have this one!

514
01:16:14,672 --> 01:16:16,228
Have this one!

515
01:16:20,146 --> 01:16:25,311
He won't use you much.
He won't hurt none.

516
01:16:25,588 --> 01:16:29,692
Our grandpa was the best killer
there ever was.

517
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:33,197
I never took all the guts to see.

518
01:16:33,298 --> 01:16:37,165
I did in 6 in 5 minutes once.

519
01:16:37,405 --> 01:16:41,008
I could've done more if the hook
pulled again could've gotten the...

520
01:16:41,109 --> 01:16:43,438
beaves out of the way faster.

521
01:16:44,013 --> 01:16:50,533
Now don't you cry. Grandpa is
the best. It won't hurt a bit.

522
01:16:53,644 --> 01:16:54,572
No!

523
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:02,095
No!

524
01:17:08,807 --> 01:17:12,737
Please! Don't!

525
01:17:28,003 --> 01:17:29,091
Hit her!

526
01:17:44,933 --> 01:17:46,328
Hit the bitch!

527
01:17:47,499 --> 01:17:49,225
Go ahead!

528
01:18:21,491 --> 01:18:24,683
Give me the hammer!

529
01:18:28,623 --> 01:18:31,314
Give me the hammer!
I'll kill her!

530
01:21:17,287 --> 01:21:22,147
Go! Go!
