1
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:52,041
Hello. I'm home alone.

2
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:57,147
They're at some alumni get-together.
They don't give a damn about their daughter.

3
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,752
Hey, if...

4
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:04,896
Kyung-Ah just paged me.
Left this voice mail to try to scare me.

5
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:11,197
Is that it? Forget about it.
Hey let's go for a drive.

6
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:17,471
- No, I can't. I have exams next week.
- Stop being such a wet blanket. Come on.

7
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:24,180
- My parents are going to be home soon.
- Stop being a tease. You know that place...

8
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:36,154
Hear what?

9
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:46,997
Chang! What's wrong?!!

10
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:16,033
You look good enough to frame.

11
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,298
So, you can replicate me?

12
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:26,237
Eun Kyung Shin

13
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,881
In this age of
modern science of cloning,

14
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,646
I'm trying to discover
who I am through the body.

15
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,413
Jin Young Jung

16
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,857
asexuality, cloning...
So multi-sexuality is the key word, right?

17
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:44,763
Chang Wan Kim

18
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:49,129
The ancient greeks had an affinity
for bi-sexuality.

19
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:54,469
The best of both worlds, a combination
of feminine beauty and masculine strength.

20
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,740
Multi-sexuality which
breaks the boundaries

21
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:00,612
Du Na Bae

22
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:03,074
between genders was admired
and worshipped two thousand years ago.

23
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:09,452
By eliminating the complications of
human intercourse,

24
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:11,353
half of the problem has been solved.

25
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:22,162
All right sweetie, mommy's gonna be home soon.
but you shouldn't call when mommy's working.

26
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:34,444
- My outfit's all ready mommy.
- OK...

27
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:45,758
- Honey, you must not say anything to them.
- Why not?

28
00:05:46,526 --> 00:05:48,426
Aunt and uncle will be very sad.

29
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:52,660
- Because of cousin Sang-Mi?
- Yeah.

30
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,669
Is Sang-Mi really dead?

31
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,453
Boram!!

32
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:33,564
Let her be. It's ok.

33
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:37,709
You want something to drink, honey?

34
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:41,009
Hello... Listen, kid,
how many times do I have to tell you?

35
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,672
I looked for it
and it's not here!

36
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:47,577
- Excuse me.
- Do you know what today is?

37
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:49,312
Here let me.

38
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,920
Yeah, I'm her aunt.

39
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:05,869
I'll find the resort
membership card for you. Ok.

40
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:11,841
Meanwhile,
could you hold off on the phone calls?

41
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:30,556
- Boram...what are you doing in here?
- I hear something.

42
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:34,590
Stop that.
Uncle's looking for you.

43
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's not here. I looked for it many times...
don't open that!

44
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:27,043
She was in there... dead...

45
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:34,216
fist full of her own hair...

46
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:43,634
don't cry.
Sang-Mi's in a better place now.

47
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:55,910
I don't know well.
I knew she was a model student.

48
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:02,718
Well...
I'm not an intimate friend with her.

49
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:08,320
The resort card that Sang-Mi borrowed,
would you know where it is?

50
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:14,764
I was supposed to go with them,
but only Sang-Mi and Kyung-Ah went.

51
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:20,269
Kyung-Ah... okay, I'll call her.

52
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:24,805
but... Kyung-Ah's...

53
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:29,075
- what about Kyung-Ah?
- you don't know?

54
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,845
don't know what?

55
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,414
She's dead too.

56
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,720
what?!! when?

57
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:50,364
The day that Sang-Mi died.
It was all over the news.

58
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:14,183
Midnight date-couple die

59
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:22,063
Hey!

60
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:25,468
Did you write this?

61
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:33,536
- wear your glasses.
- I wear them when I need them.

62
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:36,678
You don't wear condoms all day, do you?

63
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:40,819
Are there any more reference materials?

64
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:48,092
- Why are you so interested in this case?
- She's a friend of my late niece.

65
00:10:53,266 --> 00:11:01,002
She was in a state of full arousal.

66
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:05,733
Just when they were about to get into it.
They kicked the bucket.

67
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:10,546
Anything suspicious?
Strangulation...

68
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:14,409
No internal bleeding,
the police say it was a heart attack.

69
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:15,614
No substance abuse?

70
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:19,487
what do you want to hear?

71
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:22,885
The case isn't over...

72
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:27,628
There is no case.
It was a heart attack.

73
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:36,698
There was some weirdo at the autopsy.

74
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:43,142
Said something about unrecognizable shock or
something equally ridiculous. Pretty hilarious.

75
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:48,249
Wait.

76
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:52,024
Hey, wait. Stop!

77
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:09,305
Umm, Sun-Joo...

78
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:22,781
do you know the guy who died with Kyung-Ah?
Lee, Dong-Joon?

79
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:29,085
I've never met him...
She told me he was some guy she knew.

80
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:35,593
Do you think Dong-Joon went to
the resort with them?

81
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:40,998
It's oK.
I won't get mad...

82
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:48,079
Yeah, he did.
Kyung-Ah told me after she came back.

83
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:52,174
So, it was the three of them.

84
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,055
Actually, there was one more.

85
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,192
A friend of Dong-Joon joined them.

86
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,026
you shouldn't jump into
something like this.

87
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:16,233
No, there's something strange. Why would you
grab your own hair during a heart attack?

88
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,103
Park, he touches his ear
when he gets a writer's block.

89
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:24,675
I touch my feet...
you pull your hair.

90
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:28,478
Is this the doctor
with the unconventional diagnosis?

91
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:35,319
He was the best in sawing heads open,
but I heard he's off his rocker now.

92
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,392
He's not worth your time.

93
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:10,858
Excuse me.

94
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:48,228
Well...

95
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:55,267
are you dr. Choi?
I called you earlier...

96
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,656
you claimed the deaths were caused

97
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:19,163
by super natural shock
as opposed to other opinions.

98
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:24,798
Are you claiming homicide?

99
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,478
Do you have any medical evidence
to Support your claim?

100
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:49,889
No. It's just a gut feeling.

101
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,233
But shouldn't something like
this have some evidence...

102
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,734
Miss journalist,
do you have some evidence?

103
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:06,909
It could be the new virus
from the recent meteor shower...

104
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:10,673
No one knew what aidS was
when it was first discovered.

105
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,611
Have you thought of this?

106
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:21,885
For instance,
the theory that the same virus killed

107
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:26,922
all four simultaneously is more plausible
than a supernatural force as a cause of death.

108
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:37,299
these critters already know
that I'm getting them

109
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:43,207
out to play with them
or to kill them.

110
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:46,678
Why's that?

111
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:00,530
Let me guess, you won't sleep
with a guy on feelings alone.

112
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:06,028
You haven't got laid in over a year.

113
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:10,608
It's been exactly 18 months.
Satisfied?

114
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:17,180
Dr. Choi!
I'm here about the autopsy...

115
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:31,863
Listen, Dr. Choi,
I'm not interested in playing games.

116
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:47,670
two other people supposedly died
from heart attacks on the same day!

117
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:56,449
Leave the dead alone
and let the case remain closed.

118
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:08,362
Hey, where are you going?
that door's for corpses.

119
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:18,807
Sun-Joo!
you're playing a dangerous game.

120
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:22,510
It's nothing like you've ever seen.

121
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:26,011
Be careful!

122
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:32,844
We saw it was not have to see?
- Kyung-Ah 10:52 P.m.

123
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:49,866
What happened to you, Sang-Mi?

124
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:16,754
You're sure?
Thanks... the resort guys won't talk,

125
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:22,331
claimed guest Privacy
infringement or something.

126
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:26,433
Let's have a drink soon, ok...

127
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:29,902
room 105.

128
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:40,012
You want me to go with you?

129
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:56,065
Hey, Kim!
there's a gas explosion!!

130
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:59,962
What!! Let's just drop by.

131
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:07,511
All right, you go ahead.
Take this.

132
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:07,360
You regret if you see this!
4 A man of horrors-

133
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,675
we shouldn't have watched it.

134
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:39,195
May I borrow these?

135
00:23:39,998 --> 00:23:41,625
Yes, go ahead.

136
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:47,697
Do you remember the kids
who stayed in suite 105 last time?

137
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:50,732
Sorry,
I'm usually only on night duty.

138
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:42,492
Watch till the end.

139
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:50,492
Or else death will swallow you.

140
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:28,706
playing in water will summon spirits.
you'll soon bear a child next year.

141
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,736
Listen to your granny.

142
00:25:57,102 --> 00:26:02,438
Whoever watches this

143
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:08,440
will die exactly one week from now.

144
00:26:10,115 --> 00:26:15,018
If you want to live...

145
00:28:54,246 --> 00:28:56,180
mommy, aren't you going to work?

146
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:46,257
december 1st, tuesday.

147
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,383
Let me see the tape first.

148
00:30:11,656 --> 00:30:12,987
No, it's too dangerous.

149
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,651
Then why are you here?

150
00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:21,130
Didn't you come for help?

151
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:25,166
Don't you believe what l'm saying?

152
00:30:30,342 --> 00:30:31,934
Do you want me to shake in my boots?

153
00:30:41,686 --> 00:30:46,350
I'd like to see my own dead face,
if I could.

154
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:29,726
So am I involved now?

155
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:36,402
Maybe it's a practical joke.
Like one of those chain letters.

156
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:42,676
Ever see a joke this serious?

157
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:47,713
Why did those four idiots die?

158
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:52,823
The video has the spell to break
the curse and if they knew about it,

159
00:31:54,092 --> 00:31:56,356
why didn't they use it?

160
00:31:56,428 --> 00:32:00,797
Maybe they saw the tape
after the spell was recorded over.

161
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:05,461
Who erased the spell?
you have to find out.

162
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:09,370
We can't ask the dead now, can we.

163
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:22,176
You know this show?

164
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:28,816
Find out when that greasy
looking dude was on as a guest.

165
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,693
That's the day the spell was erased.

166
00:32:33,598 --> 00:32:38,126
It wasn't recent. The clothes
they're wearing are out of fashion.

167
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:44,767
- I have to find that out too?
- Of course. Anyone else who's seen the tape?

168
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:50,077
Show it to people, after wards,

169
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:52,673
you'll have plenty of helpers
on your hands.

170
00:32:57,889 --> 00:32:59,481
Why aren't you in bed?

171
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,708
Could l get some copy?
I want to take my time with this.

172
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,296
Cheers! Pretty exciting huh?

173
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,664
A game of life and death.

174
00:33:46,271 --> 00:33:48,739
Seven days left.

175
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:53,839
You're a day ahead.

176
00:33:56,848 --> 00:34:02,115
december 2nd, wednesday

177
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:23,103
all right.
You don't have to watch it.

178
00:34:25,276 --> 00:34:28,143
But you help me.

179
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:41,991
The tape deck in the resort room was installed
in September. Who left this in suite 105?

180
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:43,858
That's too much snooping!

181
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:47,888
OK, narrow it down to November.
It was probably before the quadruple deaths.

182
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:52,168
If you can find the culprit too,
that'd be great.

183
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:58,201
- Sun-Joo, have a seat.
- I only have six days left.

184
00:34:59,744 --> 00:35:00,676
Hey, come here.

185
00:35:02,313 --> 00:35:07,444
Mr. Kong?
I need you to find out something.

186
00:35:08,453 --> 00:35:14,153
The guest that was on the show... yes.

187
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:48,749
Mysterious death during brain surgery

188
00:37:01,332 --> 00:37:05,393
december 3rd, thursday.

189
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:12,469
This looks like the tidal wave in the video.

190
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:15,306
Judging from the height,
it's definitely a seismic wave.

191
00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:20,240
From 1951 to 83,
there were four of these just in the east sea.

192
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:25,989
If it would be pictured by video camera,
it maybe made at 1983...

193
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:28,184
is a 1971 model.

194
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:31,888
the tv in the tape...

195
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:36,961
The tape was filmed
and was left in 105 by someone?

196
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:44,508
A family stayed in the room 3 days
be fore the four victims...

197
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:46,938
their kid probably left the tape
in there after

198
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:49,445
he tried to record that show.

199
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:56,645
then the four victims stayed there next
and watched the tape on a whim.

200
00:37:58,756 --> 00:38:02,852
They probably thought
the whole thing was ajoke

201
00:38:03,828 --> 00:38:08,561
and erased the spell at the end
to scared the next people.

202
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:18,005
Why was this recorded on the blank tape
that was in the vcr?

203
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,208
Is there anything else?

204
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:23,738
That's all I have.

205
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:29,480
What's about you?

206
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:31,420
Stop it there.

207
00:38:39,664 --> 00:38:41,962
Don't you feel something slippery

208
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:45,196
when you watch this part?

209
00:38:52,877 --> 00:38:56,506
Look closely.
That dark obstruction, what is it?

210
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:04,286
What about it?
Is it important?

211
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:07,491
Aren't we impatient today.

212
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:15,258
If you want answers.
You have to find the person who made this.

213
00:39:16,134 --> 00:39:21,094
Right, I should go back to the resort
where the tape originated from.

214
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:24,132
Obviously alone.

215
00:39:25,543 --> 00:39:28,706
- I'm sorry doctor, I thought you were alone...
- Come in.

216
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:39,622
This is Ji-Yeon. My one and only pupil.

217
00:39:40,558 --> 00:39:43,083
This is Sun-Joo,
a devoted believer of modern science.

218
00:39:44,095 --> 00:39:47,121
- You have a call from the publisher.
- What the fuck do they want now?

219
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:50,698
- They couldn't get in touch with you.
- Tell the fuck to wait.

220
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:54,796
You should call them.
It should hold them off for about a week.

221
00:39:55,573 --> 00:40:01,409
Everything is in a week. Go buy some of these
and not ones with a week left till expiration.

222
00:40:09,787 --> 00:40:11,118
Let's not waste any more time.

223
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:14,488
How about an ad in the paper to find the person
who made this?

224
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:19,088
you have a day less than I do.
It's you who should get a move on.

225
00:40:21,065 --> 00:40:24,557
I'd like to see that smile wiped
off your face after I'm dead.

226
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:29,133
You're my partner.
You can't die.

227
00:41:47,952 --> 00:41:50,887
Hey!! No!
What are you doing?

228
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:56,282
Cousin Sang-Mi told me to watch.

229
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:48,508
What did you find out?

230
00:42:54,218 --> 00:42:55,651
Tell me for heaven's sake!

231
00:42:58,122 --> 00:43:00,989
I'm not offering a solution,
only evidence.

232
00:43:01,058 --> 00:43:03,754
I want to know what you've thought up.

233
00:43:08,566 --> 00:43:11,399
Only 4 days remaining,
but there are so many barriers...

234
00:43:15,773 --> 00:43:17,502
my daughter watched the goddamn video.

235
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:24,103
More reason to calm down.
Go splash some cold water on your face.

236
00:43:32,924 --> 00:43:34,755
I divided the video screen into two.

237
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:40,759
Abstract images in the head
and what can be seen with the eyes.

238
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:53,934
There's that dark obstruction
over the real images.

239
00:43:55,479 --> 00:43:57,777
- Remember this.
- Go on.

240
00:43:59,717 --> 00:44:02,845
The characters behind
the obstruction are all real.

241
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,652
What do you feel?

242
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:18,058
Don't you feel like
you're being reproached?

243
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:21,533
These images,

244
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:27,633
we thought they were captured on camera.

245
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:31,315
But?

246
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:33,908
Look closely.

247
00:44:41,425 --> 00:44:42,915
Those faint shadows.

248
00:44:45,096 --> 00:44:47,724
why do I feel like
I'm actually there?

249
00:44:57,708 --> 00:45:00,108
This game's getting better and better.

250
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:04,681
Someone recorded
these images through telekinesis.

251
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:10,550
A man blinks twenty times a minute,
a woman blinks fifteen.

252
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:12,947
It's highly probable the tape
was produced by a woman.

253
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,052
What are you trying to say?

254
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:22,458
The blank tape in the resort suite.

255
00:45:24,902 --> 00:45:30,465
A woman with super natural powers transferred
images from her head to the video.

256
00:45:34,245 --> 00:45:35,507
I can feel it.

257
00:45:38,249 --> 00:45:40,308
The damp darkness...

258
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:02,102
exactly, who are you looking for?

259
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,908
Someone with telekinetic ability,
who's probably in hiding now.

260
00:46:07,878 --> 00:46:13,248
Telekinesis. There are so many cases
and many are fraudulent.

261
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:20,081
May we try?

262
00:46:23,394 --> 00:46:29,128
december 4th, friday.

263
00:46:31,435 --> 00:46:33,300
Are you sure it's here?

264
00:46:34,438 --> 00:46:36,030
Highly probable.

265
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:42,037
Concentrate on the southern province.
that old hag in the video was

266
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,745
speaking southern dialect.
I asked a friend about it.

267
00:46:46,784 --> 00:46:51,016
playing in water will summon spirits.
you'll bear a child next year.

268
00:46:51,055 --> 00:46:53,785
Listen to your granny.

269
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:56,557
What does that mean?

270
00:46:57,394 --> 00:47:00,329
Don't ask me.
That's your job.

271
00:47:25,723 --> 00:47:27,748
Is this it?

272
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:32,656
Maybe.
Take down the name and address.

273
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:28,840
What's the matter?

274
00:48:35,192 --> 00:48:36,216
Nothing.

275
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:46,833
It's here.
It has to be.

276
00:49:15,232 --> 00:49:16,824
Park... Eun... Suh...

277
00:49:19,136 --> 00:49:21,502
This is her invitation.

278
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:47,787
Are you still busy these days?

279
00:49:48,132 --> 00:49:50,828
I guess so... I'm sorry, mom.

280
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:53,699
That's all right, honey.
We'd love to have Boram with us.

281
00:49:54,171 --> 00:50:00,303
- But is something wrong?
- No, everything's fine.

282
00:50:37,681 --> 00:50:48,489
december 5th. Saturday

283
00:50:49,493 --> 00:50:54,954
Those four dim wits,
why didn't they execute the spell?

284
00:50:57,868 --> 00:51:01,031
Simple. They didn't believe in it.

285
00:51:01,071 --> 00:51:08,773
Fear of dying is a basic instinct.
It can not be ignored easily.

286
00:51:09,446 --> 00:51:12,847
At least one of them
should have tried to prevent it.

287
00:51:19,356 --> 00:51:23,190
Maybe, the spell to break
the curse are difficult to execute.

288
00:51:25,329 --> 00:51:29,857
If so, what will you do?

289
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:35,070
It depends on if we find out.

290
00:51:36,507 --> 00:51:39,408
We only have the name Park, Eun-Suh.

291
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:50,414
Man, what an ordeal!

292
00:51:51,355 --> 00:51:52,151
Why?

293
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:57,388
Everyone over reacts
to the mention of Eun-Suh.

294
00:51:58,495 --> 00:52:00,861
They consider the mother
and daughter as witches.

295
00:52:01,765 --> 00:52:04,427
- Mother and daughter?
- Didn't you hear?

296
00:52:05,669 --> 00:52:09,765
Park, Jung-Sook,
Eun-Suh's mother had incredible powers.

297
00:52:11,008 --> 00:52:12,839
They were amazing at one time.

298
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:16,977
They'd predict rain...
they'd predict high winds...

299
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:22,344
after Jung-Sook killed herself,
Eun-Suh lost her Powers.

300
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:25,119
You mean her powers
and foresight disappeared?

301
00:52:26,123 --> 00:52:28,921
Yes.
She lived normally with her uncle

302
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,855
and disappeared after high school.

303
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:44,699
She jumped from here?

304
00:52:45,175 --> 00:52:49,805
Yes,
this place hasn't changed since.

305
00:53:46,303 --> 00:53:48,328
Why did Jung-Sook kill herself?

306
00:54:24,908 --> 00:54:26,375
Do you need a room?

307
00:54:28,111 --> 00:54:30,079
We're looking for Park, Eun-Suh.

308
00:54:31,682 --> 00:54:34,583
- What? You don't need a room?
- Yes, we do need a room.

309
00:54:37,854 --> 00:54:41,187
Sir,
we're looking for Park, Eun-Suh.

310
00:54:45,696 --> 00:54:47,687
You journalists should know better.

311
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:55,962
She's not here.

312
00:54:56,707 --> 00:55:01,371
Father! I'm sorry.
My father-in-law doesn't mean it that way...

313
00:55:01,445 --> 00:55:04,972
Do you know where she is?
Did something happen to her?

314
00:55:05,282 --> 00:55:09,548
- I don't know, I'm not from here.
- Ma'am...

315
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:17,192
Your room is ready.
It's got a good view.

316
00:55:17,628 --> 00:55:19,596
- I need another room...
- Pardon?

317
00:55:19,696 --> 00:55:23,826
- Another room...
- Of course... coming right uP.

318
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:15,017
- Father...
- Just do as I say...

319
00:56:15,852 --> 00:56:18,548
- At this time of the night?
- The guests are leaving!

320
00:56:23,326 --> 00:56:33,201
Sir, you know where she is, don't you?
It's a matter of life and death.

321
00:56:34,004 --> 00:56:37,462
That time,
It's a matter of life and death, too.

322
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,307
Ma'am... please help us?

323
00:57:57,721 --> 00:58:01,851
I hope this helps...

324
00:58:09,466 --> 00:58:12,799
this was the last thing
we got from her.

325
00:58:36,893 --> 00:58:41,262
I know my father-in-law misses here too.

326
00:58:52,209 --> 00:58:55,804
Park, Jung-Sook had supernatural powers?

327
00:58:56,746 --> 00:59:00,079
She met a man named Oh, Chang-Joon
when she was 21.

328
00:59:02,853 --> 00:59:07,950
- Oh...Chang...what?
- Chang-Joon. He was a professor of psychiatry.

329
00:59:08,058 --> 00:59:10,026
They started out as patient and doctor
and the relationship became amorous.

330
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,927
Eun-Suh was their child.

331
00:59:13,463 --> 00:59:16,261
Park... what are you saying?

332
00:59:17,534 --> 00:59:20,799
Dr. Oh was a married man.
He already had a child.

333
00:59:22,906 --> 00:59:28,037
That's life...
Hey, there's a storm front moving in.

334
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:33,012
Anyway,
they caused quite a media scandal.

335
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:38,043
Jung-Sook killed herself and dr. Oh
died a ruined man. Can you find out?

336
00:59:39,322 --> 00:59:42,621
- I got it. I'll look into it when I can.
- When?

337
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:47,487
Hey, I'm swamped!
I have two deadlines to meet.

338
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:49,496
How can you say that?

339
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:53,727
What's about me?
I've got two days to live!

340
00:59:55,872 --> 00:59:59,330
All right, which one first?
Mother or daughter?

341
01:00:00,844 --> 01:00:03,904
Eun-Suh holds the key.
There's more.

342
01:00:04,981 --> 01:00:07,575
She predicted a seismic tidal wave
at the age of 11.

343
01:00:08,485 --> 01:00:12,114
Well, on that day, an enormous tidal wave
swallowed the island as well as the mainland.

344
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:16,615
- That's what I saw on the video.
- That's on the video?

345
01:00:21,064 --> 01:00:22,554
It wasn't shot by a person.

346
01:00:31,741 --> 01:00:35,973
1973?
Are you kidding? Sun-Joo,

347
01:00:36,579 --> 01:00:40,276
I can barely trace information from last year.
That's two decades ago!!

348
01:00:42,385 --> 01:00:45,013
You mean Park, Eun-Suh
was a nightclub singer?

349
01:00:47,257 --> 01:00:48,053
Mukoy Dong?

350
01:00:51,227 --> 01:00:53,354
I'm the one who phoned.
Please take a look.

351
01:01:00,403 --> 01:01:01,370
Park, Eun-Suh...

352
01:01:04,975 --> 01:01:13,280
You mean Sunny Park. Singer, my ass,
she was a golfer for about a year.

353
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:16,681
You remember her?
Was she pretty?

354
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,483
Well... She looked like...

355
01:01:32,268 --> 01:01:37,900
december 6th. Sunday

356
01:02:14,978 --> 01:02:16,605
I found out something interesting.

357
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:15,917
Why he dead...? what he saw!?

358
01:05:18,027 --> 01:05:22,020
Park Eun Suh's supernatural powers would not
be disappeared. Instead, more big...

359
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:29,104
- Turn on the tv..., kill the men...
- Man! the ferry has been canceled!

360
01:05:30,173 --> 01:05:31,401
The ferry has been canceled!

361
01:05:35,144 --> 01:05:38,875
What do we do now?
You can't leave for a day or two.

362
01:05:42,919 --> 01:05:45,444
We have to get out of here.
Tomorrow will be too late.

363
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:52,785
This storm is our chance.
The key to the puzzle is in Eun-Suh's home.

364
01:05:54,264 --> 01:05:57,563
We should never have come here.
That damn video.

365
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:02,200
I should have kept my nose out of this.
Now, Boram's been dragged into this mess.

366
01:06:03,906 --> 01:06:05,601
Nice to know you care about me.

367
01:07:54,317 --> 01:07:59,949
She would've been quite attractive.

368
01:08:06,095 --> 01:08:08,188
Super natural power revealed

369
01:11:52,722 --> 01:11:56,089
What does people think
at their moment of death.

370
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:06,432
This video is ...

371
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:12,265
We saw something not of this world.

372
01:12:19,281 --> 01:12:25,413
No, Eun-Suh's not dead.
She's alive....

373
01:12:33,129 --> 01:12:36,098
- Kim?
- It's over. We lost track.

374
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,867
- What do you mean?
- Further investigation is impossible.

375
01:12:41,637 --> 01:12:46,301
- Park, Eun-Suh's disappeared.
- Kim,

376
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:01,488
She's not dead.
She's disappeared...

377
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:08,052
What did the old lady say?
About giving birth?

378
01:13:11,534 --> 01:13:13,297
Who's the man in the video!

379
01:13:17,707 --> 01:13:22,576
Don't ask me. Use your head!

380
01:13:26,682 --> 01:13:33,349
We've uncovered alot.

381
01:13:35,291 --> 01:13:39,352
But we're not even close to solving
the fucking curse!

382
01:13:41,897 --> 01:13:43,831
You're afraid, aren't you?

383
01:13:45,835 --> 01:13:47,803
Only of one thing.

384
01:13:51,741 --> 01:13:54,869
That I'll die before
I solve this third-rate riddle!

385
01:13:59,115 --> 01:14:01,015
That's the only thing I'm afraid of.

386
01:14:01,217 --> 01:14:03,344
Still think it's a game?

387
01:14:05,721 --> 01:14:10,715
Then what's about two years ago.
Was that patient a pawn in a sick game?

388
01:14:23,172 --> 01:14:25,265
I shouldn't have trusted
a quack like you.

389
01:14:27,676 --> 01:14:29,234
It wasn't a game.

390
01:14:32,782 --> 01:14:36,047
She was Boram's age.
Everyone said there was no hope.

391
01:14:36,085 --> 01:14:37,450
There is no possibility of revival...

392
01:14:37,486 --> 01:14:41,081
but I did it.
The surgery turned out well.

393
01:14:44,093 --> 01:14:45,720
I was high on my success.

394
01:14:48,264 --> 01:14:50,027
But I heard someone whisper

395
01:14:52,401 --> 01:14:54,266
"I'm taking her..."

396
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:02,677
She suffered for two days.

397
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:08,310
I killed her.

398
01:15:17,326 --> 01:15:21,729
Do you regret watching the video?

399
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:25,557
The game's not over.

400
01:15:28,838 --> 01:15:30,533
We still have a day.

401
01:15:32,174 --> 01:15:33,937
You have one more day..

402
01:16:45,114 --> 01:16:53,249
I know who drove Eun-Suh
and her family to ruin...

403
01:16:55,925 --> 01:17:01,761
they put her on a pedestal
and shook it...

404
01:17:06,869 --> 01:17:11,806
But why me?
Why am l being cursed?

405
01:17:12,274 --> 01:17:14,640
You're ajournalist like them.

406
01:17:23,018 --> 01:17:29,389
Someone painted that picture on the wall.
He's probably the last one to see her.

407
01:17:40,903 --> 01:17:47,399
You know something. We don't have any time.
We have to break the curse.

408
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:11,095
It's strange.
I'm not scared at all.

409
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:17,031
If we die now,
I'll just be going a day earlier.

410
01:18:18,941 --> 01:18:20,499
What happens when you die?

411
01:18:22,211 --> 01:18:26,204
I don't know.
That's what scares people.

412
01:18:31,053 --> 01:18:33,146
If the woman in the picture is Eun-Suh...

413
01:18:34,356 --> 01:18:36,483
I'd like to meet the artist.

414
01:18:40,262 --> 01:18:42,924
He's the only one who was there.

415
01:18:49,638 --> 01:18:53,005
You know who he is?

416
01:18:54,443 --> 01:19:00,871
It's her half brother...
Chang-Joon's son.

417
01:19:10,726 --> 01:19:12,216
The storm's passed us by.

418
01:19:14,029 --> 01:19:16,020
I guess we made it.

419
01:19:20,302 --> 01:19:22,793
I'll call you when we find her.

420
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:35,615
december 7th, monday

421
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:32,136
This is why game's fun.

422
01:20:40,315 --> 01:20:44,183
Oh, Kyung-Pil!
what have you done with her?!

423
01:20:58,534 --> 01:21:00,627
What's the scar on your shoulder for?

424
01:21:10,546 --> 01:21:22,481
Boram? mommy's gonna get you tomorrow.
I'm busy. Be good for grandma.

425
01:21:27,563 --> 01:21:29,087
What time did you watch the video?

426
01:21:29,998 --> 01:21:33,593
10:06 or 7.
It was definitely before 10:10.

427
01:21:53,889 --> 01:21:57,689
I was in a sanatorium for small pox...

428
01:21:59,194 --> 01:22:03,062
Eun-Suh came to nurse me...

429
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:08,102
We loved each other in a special way.

430
01:22:18,413 --> 01:22:23,749
It was so simple.
Everything began here.

431
01:22:25,954 --> 01:22:29,185
- I need some rest.
- We don't have time.

432
01:22:29,591 --> 01:22:31,081
Calm down.

433
01:22:34,496 --> 01:22:36,396
Eun-Suh were here.

434
01:23:38,293 --> 01:23:41,694
I find, here!

435
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:59,679
I saw male and female in her body...

436
01:24:03,118 --> 01:24:08,021
and then I could not remember
what I did...

437
01:24:31,413 --> 01:24:34,507
She would be live still...

438
01:25:13,221 --> 01:25:14,153
Are you all right?

439
01:25:18,326 --> 01:25:21,693
Stop worrying and drop the bucket.

440
01:26:26,595 --> 01:26:28,392
I have not enough time.

441
01:26:32,968 --> 01:26:36,495
- What's wrong?
- Your turn.

442
01:26:40,308 --> 01:26:43,402
I need to rest before I can...

443
01:26:47,682 --> 01:26:49,240
Did you forgot it to call before?

444
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:56,123
Your daughter is at stake here?
Is that what you want?

445
01:27:08,937 --> 01:27:12,304
You really think this will work?

446
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:14,967
Just get down there.

447
01:27:16,344 --> 01:27:22,476
Gather her remains and put her to rest.
That's the spell to break the curse.

448
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

449
01:29:00,015 --> 01:29:06,443
Eun Suh, wherever you are...
please appear.

450
01:30:12,487 --> 01:30:14,250
Rest in peace Eun-Suh...

451
01:30:33,608 --> 01:30:34,802
Sun Joo...

452
01:30:36,945 --> 01:30:42,281
the time of death was passed.
We are the winner's of the game.

453
01:30:51,626 --> 01:30:55,084
She survived in the well for a week.

454
01:30:56,798 --> 01:31:00,700
She transferred her fear
and suffering to us...

455
01:31:03,671 --> 01:31:06,936
Why didn't she curse Oh, Kyung-Pil?

456
01:31:08,443 --> 01:31:13,710
She may have wanted to die.
Maybe with some help.

457
01:31:15,683 --> 01:31:18,049
Because she lamented itself condition.

458
01:31:21,556 --> 01:31:24,389
Just as light and darkness existed
as one before the big bang,

459
01:31:25,994 --> 01:31:30,829
man and woman probably
co-existed as one.

460
01:31:32,801 --> 01:31:36,134
A perfect combination of
strength and beauty.

461
01:31:37,972 --> 01:31:41,635
But she was the target of
ridicule in her life.

462
01:31:42,911 --> 01:31:49,146
She just wanted a normal life.
To have children...

463
01:31:52,654 --> 01:31:55,088
Her only legacy is the video.

464
01:32:00,962 --> 01:32:06,332
We only know parts of reality.
But we can't know the beginning and the end.

465
01:32:10,071 --> 01:32:11,936
That's life.

466
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:54,007
So, it's over, huh?

467
01:32:57,418 --> 01:32:59,750
Hey, I was having a nice dream.

468
01:33:08,997 --> 01:33:10,487
I was actually flying.

469
01:33:34,555 --> 01:33:38,355
Hey... do you like beer?

470
01:33:42,297 --> 01:33:43,855
Thought you'd never ask.

471
01:33:58,746 --> 01:34:02,307
Set date.
If you don't want my curse,

472
01:34:38,553 --> 01:34:40,851
Sun-Joo! What's going on?

473
01:34:42,123 --> 01:34:47,652
You ever hear of cell phones?

474
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

475
01:37:46,174 --> 01:37:48,870
I'm Hong Sun Joo,
please leave a message.

476
01:39:28,976 --> 01:39:32,468
- When did it happen?
- Around ten last night.

477
01:39:33,581 --> 01:39:34,741
And the cause of death?

478
01:39:36,117 --> 01:39:39,518
They said cardiac arrest.

479
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:49,229
Did he leave any information
about the videotape?

480
01:39:51,365 --> 01:39:52,491
What tape?

481
01:40:03,644 --> 01:40:05,509
Why am I spared?

482
01:40:16,357 --> 01:40:24,560
You know. Please tell me! please!
Boram is next.

483
01:41:07,108 --> 01:41:10,635
What I did and you didn't...

484
01:41:14,915 --> 01:41:18,817
what I did and you didn't...

485
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:26,426
what I did and you...

486
01:41:47,882 --> 01:41:49,543
Is this your spell ?

487
01:41:52,086 --> 01:41:54,577
You have given birth to
something haven't you.

488
01:41:59,994 --> 01:42:06,160
If you want to live.
Copy this tape and give to another

489
01:42:06,801 --> 01:42:13,400
Mom, it's me.
How's Boram? yeah, I'm on my way.

490
01:42:15,009 --> 01:42:16,567
Mom, do you have a vcr?

491
01:42:18,846 --> 01:42:21,178
Stay there.
I'll be right over.

492
01:42:23,451 --> 01:42:25,885
I have something you must watch.

493
01:42:26,887 --> 01:42:28,684
It's for Boram.
