1
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:31,540
What, what?

2
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,376
Captain?

3
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,792
- What was that?

4
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,208
- A whale?

5
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,916
- Whales don't sound like that.

6
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:50,832
- What, you get a lotta whales

7
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:52,292
on the Lower East Side, Bigelow?

8
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:53,124
- Listen.

9
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,084
It's a ship.

10
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:08,916
- A ship?

11
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:10,876
We're saved?

12
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,208
- Faraday, give your life
vest to Miss Prescott.

13
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,000
- Oh, for heaven sake,
the man has a broken arm.

14
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,960
Ahoy, over here!

15
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,460
- Oi, sit down you fat
head, you'll capsize us.

16
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,208
- Don't you touch me.

17
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,040
- Look.

18
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:30,500
- Great.

19
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:33,040
Fuckin' Nazis.

20
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,460
- I don't care if it's Hitler's
personal pleasure cruiser.

21
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,292
This is the only ship
that we've come across

22
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:38,460
the last two--
- Keep your voice down.

23
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,000
- And what are they
gonna do, shoot us?

24
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,500
We're dead anyways.

25
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,584
- He's right, Captain.

26
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,708
The Russian's are done.

27
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,500
- Chances are they'll
shoot me on sight,

28
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,624
but I guess that's better
than starvin' to death.

29
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:56,624
We got to get off this raft,
simple as that Captain.

30
00:04:56,752 --> 00:04:58,624
- What about her?

31
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:02,792
What do you think those sons
of bitches will do to her?

32
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:04,708
- I'll not have any of
your deaths on my hands.

33
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,208
We'll live to fight
another day, hm?

34
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,040
All of us.

35
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,292
- Perhaps we could consider
some of the other options.

36
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:14,040
I simply mustn't be allowed
to fall into enemy hands.

37
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,792
- What makes you
so bloody special?

38
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:17,376
- Surely there's something
more we can do besides--

39
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:18,584
- Can it, Specks.

40
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,124
We'll hitch a ride
with the krauts.

41
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:44,252
Brace yourselves!

42
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,124
Hey!

43
00:05:47,124 --> 00:05:48,500
- Captain Malone
and Sinclair: Hey!

44
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,332
Hey!

45
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:50,832
- Down here!
- Hey!

46
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:52,668
- Hello!
- Hey!

47
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:56,000
You dirty bastards!

48
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,376
- I can't see anyone on deck.

49
00:05:57,376 --> 00:05:58,208
- Hello!
- Hey!

50
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,168
- Hello!
- Hey!

51
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:00,000
Ahoy!

52
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,876
- Hello?
- Hey!

53
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:03,668
- What are you doin'?

54
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:05,252
- Need a tow-line.

55
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:07,124
Shit!

56
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:08,168
Everybody hold still.

57
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,040
Oh!

58
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:15,460
- How many bullets left?

59
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,540
- Wait a God damn minute.

60
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,208
You speak English?

61
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,540
- I never said I could not.

62
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,584
Well,
this is just perfect.

63
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:24,460
- How many bullets?

64
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,292
- One.

65
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,624
- Sniper?

66
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,376
- Nah, we're not gonna give
our only rifle to the Russian.

67
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:34,292
- Yeah, especially
to a guy who's

68
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:35,876
been spyin' on
us the whole time.

69
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:36,876
You can't trust this guy.

70
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:40,040
- What's he gonna
do with one bullet?

71
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,292
- Hopefully not miss.

72
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:53,916
- You buyin' it
or firing it Ivan?

73
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,084
- The Enfield, Mark One.

74
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:57,624
Old action rifle.

75
00:06:57,624 --> 00:07:00,708
Shoots to left if not
properly re-calibrated.

76
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,000
- I swear to God,
Ivan if you miss--

77
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,208
- Look, would you just shut up
and let the man concentrate?

78
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,624
- Gentlemen, we're
running out of ship.

79
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,960
He got it!

80
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,792
Grab it.

81
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:23,624
Grab it!

82
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:25,416
Grab it!

83
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:27,208
Pull.

84
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,040
Pull!

85
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:33,000
- Heave!

86
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:35,624
- Pull!

87
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:37,960
Get up there Teplov.

88
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:41,540
Captain, hold on.

89
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,584
Come on, come on, pull, pull.

90
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:45,416
- Ivan!

91
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:47,960
- Come on, come on climb.

92
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,792
- Climb.

93
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,792
- Who up now?

94
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:55,084
Miss Prescott, Miss
Prescott my hand.

95
00:07:55,084 --> 00:07:56,584
- You got her?
- Thank you.

96
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:58,252
Bigelow?

97
00:07:58,252 --> 00:07:59,540
- Come on.
- Come on Bigelow.

98
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,208
- Come on.
- Jackson?

99
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,916
Faraday, come on.

100
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:03,752
- I couldn't
possibly, it's my arm.

101
00:08:03,752 --> 00:08:05,040
- Mr. Faraday, come on.

102
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,208
- Captain, come on!
- Come on Mr. Faraday.

103
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,084
Give me your hand.

104
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:08,292
Mr. Faraday, Sir?
- Come on.

105
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,000
- Come here.
- We don't have all day mate!

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,832
- Come on.
- No!

107
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:11,708
- Grab a hold.
- No, no.

108
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,540
- Come on.
- Get on.

109
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,084
Get up here.

110
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:14,916
Come on here, here.

111
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:15,708
Get on Faraday.

112
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:16,540
Up you go, come on.

113
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,376
Grab him, grab him.

114
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:18,208
Come on.

115
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,040
- All right, move, move, move.

116
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,876
Here we go.

117
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:21,708
- All right.

118
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,584
Oh, damn.

119
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:23,540
Come on Captain.

120
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:25,208
- Captain!

121
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,040
Come on Captain.

122
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,124
Grab him Jackson.

123
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:28,208
Come on Cap.

124
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,668
There we go.

125
00:08:31,252 --> 00:08:32,084
- Pull him up!

126
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:33,252
- Come on!
- Come on Captain!

127
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:34,168
- Come on Captain.

128
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,208
You're a damn fool Captain.

129
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,292
Captain!

130
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,832
Captain!
- Jesus Christ!

131
00:08:45,252 --> 00:08:47,460
- Hey, hey.
- What?

132
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,376
Captain!

133
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:50,332
- Jackson, I'm sorry he's gone.

134
00:08:50,332 --> 00:08:51,168
He's gone.

135
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:52,960
Yeah, he's gone.

136
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,792
Come on, everyone.

137
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:27,168
- How's that hand Mr. Faraday?

138
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:28,000
- No, no, no.

139
00:09:33,668 --> 00:09:35,208
Gerard...

140
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,292
I, look, I...

141
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,000
- The Englishman
has many secrets.

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,168
- You're one to talk.

143
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:43,416
- You limey weasel.

144
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,832
- You were gonna
let us starve to death

145
00:09:44,832 --> 00:09:46,500
so you could live
a few more days.

146
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,376
- You'd have done the same if

147
00:09:47,376 --> 00:09:49,000
you had the
brains to think of it.

148
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,332
The work I do affects
the lives of millions.

149
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:53,540
You're just meat
for the grinder.

150
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:55,208
- Oh!

151
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,084
Leave him alone.

152
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:57,500
He's harmless.

153
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,292
- He's a coward is what he is.

154
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:00,416
- Who's to say that fuckin' arm

155
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,792
ain't even broken?
- Hey, hey, hey.

156
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:02,624
- Yeah, why don't we

157
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:03,460
just throw him overboard?
- Hey!

158
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,460
- Oh, enough!

159
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,500
In case you'd
forgotten we're all

160
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,332
on the same side,
now act like it.

161
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,252
- You know what
I think is strange?

162
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:12,124
- Oh, what?

163
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,960
- All this, this
fighting and shouting.

164
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:23,792
No one comes to see, hm?

165
00:10:39,668 --> 00:10:42,084
- It's one bloody thing
after another isn't it?

166
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:43,792
- Let's take shelter.

167
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:45,416
- Amen to that toots.

168
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:50,668
Mr. Sinclair,
perhaps you could help.

169
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:52,960
Come on.

170
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,876
- Engine's runnin' but--

171
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:28,376
- Nobody's home.

172
00:11:28,376 --> 00:11:29,832
It seems that way.

173
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:31,500
- We can't stay out here.

174
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,668
- Well, if you wanna
go stumbling around

175
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:34,584
in the dark go
knock yourself out.

176
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:39,252
After you ladybird.

177
00:11:40,752 --> 00:11:41,584
- Oi.

178
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:43,916
What have you and uh, Ivan--

179
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,540
Teplov.

180
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,376
- What?

181
00:11:46,376 --> 00:11:48,960
- Junior Sergeant
Alexander Teplov.

182
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,292
With the four keeps--
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

183
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:52,292
Sniper.

184
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:53,124
- Yeah.

185
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:54,040
- Yeah, got it.

186
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,792
Why don't you and Bigelow
head up to the bridge?

187
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:59,416
See who's steerin'
the thing, huh?

188
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,708
- I'm not goin' anywhere
with the fascist.

189
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,460
- Communist, dickhead.

190
00:12:05,332 --> 00:12:06,168
- What's the difference?

191
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:08,960
- Hey look, why don't you just
do what the man says Bigelow?

192
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,460
- And since when did you
start givin' me orders?

193
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:19,124
- Come, I do not bite.

194
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:29,584
- Gosh he's smug.

195
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:37,416
- You know you're
gonna get frostbite?

196
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:42,084
- Yeah, I've been through worse.

197
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:44,708
- All you Cossacks
are a bit loony.

198
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,752
- And you Americans
talk too much.

199
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:52,124
- I preferred when
you didn't talk at all.

200
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:57,960
- We need to get his
arm back into a sling.

201
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:01,708
- Hm.

202
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,584
- Yes, Ma'am.

203
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:07,416
- Thank you Mr. Sinclair.

204
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,124
- Fuck, it's mouldy.

205
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,540
You wanna point that
outta my fuckin' face?

206
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,708
Jesus man.

207
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,540
Fuck.

208
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,624
Oh.

209
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,460
Oh.

210
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,084
- Here you go.

211
00:13:58,084 --> 00:13:59,168
Courtesy of the Fuhrer.

212
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:03,292
- It's not exactly my colour.

213
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:05,208
- A sling, your majesty.

214
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,832
- Colonist.

215
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:08,832
- Imperialist.

216
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:10,416
- Convict.

217
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,252
- Wanker.

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,916
Over here.

219
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,460
- You go.

220
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,000
- Okay.

221
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,040
You gonna be all
right Miss Prescott?

222
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,124
- We're fine.

223
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:40,540
- It was a cowardly
thing I did, I know.

224
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,168
- I've seen men do
far worse in this war.

225
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,668
Sinclair!

226
00:15:07,624 --> 00:15:08,540
- Hey.

227
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:14,624
- You ought to know.

228
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,708
- Blimey.

229
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,124
The life boats have

230
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:25,208
been sabotaged too.
- Oh, you're kidding me man?

231
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,624
- You ever seen
anything like this before?

232
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:33,540
- I have seen gas
turn a man inside out,

233
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,460
but nothing like this.

234
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,832
- Whatever it is it's startin'

235
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:38,752
to give me the creeps all right?

236
00:15:38,752 --> 00:15:40,332
There's somethin' wrong here.

237
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:43,292
- I knew farmers who
took up arms against

238
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:45,752
the Wehrmacht with more
courage than you.

239
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:47,752
- Hey, what do you want from me?

240
00:15:47,752 --> 00:15:49,668
I'm a God damn cook, all right?

241
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:51,376
Three years in that
fuckin' war and then

242
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,916
I get torpedoed my way
home and then I get stuck

243
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:57,376
on that God forsaken raft
with no food and no water

244
00:15:57,376 --> 00:15:59,624
and now you're tellin' me
that my only fuckin' chance

245
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:03,040
of hope is on some God
forsaken ghost ship?

246
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,584
On top of it you
forgot to mention

247
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:07,292
I got stuck with you, you
cloak and dagger asshole

248
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:10,708
and that limey prick
and you, Australia.

249
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,752
I ain't even know you
people were in the war.

250
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:13,960
- Pull your head in mate.

251
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,540
- Hey, I ain't your mate, okay?

252
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,040
I don't owe you people nothin'.

253
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,084
We got stuck in the same war

254
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:22,040
and now get stuck
in the same boat.

255
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,292
- Yeah, we did and
we're still breathin'.

256
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:29,376
- I just want lady luck to
smile on me just this once.

257
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:31,624
- It ain't about luck mate.

258
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:34,376
It ain't.

259
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:36,708
It's about how you play
the hand you're dealt.

260
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:43,876
Look, keep this to
ourselves for now.

261
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,252
- All right.

262
00:16:51,252 --> 00:16:52,084
Okay.

263
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,416
No shoes.

264
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,168
- What's your excuse?

265
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,584
- I was in bunk
when torpedo hit.

266
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,624
- Oh, you poor thing.

267
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,500
We'll get you out of
the retched weather.

268
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,832
We'll find a sickbay, okay?

269
00:17:25,832 --> 00:17:27,668
- So you're British
Intelligence?

270
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:31,624
- Something like that.

271
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:32,460
Oh, oh.

272
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,500
- How'd you get here?

273
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,292
- He needs rest Mr. Jackson,
not an interrogation.

274
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,376
Watch your step.

275
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,668
- You guys find anything?

276
00:17:45,668 --> 00:17:48,832
- Uh, no just a busted
compass and uh,

277
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:52,916
someone chained
the wheel, no Jerries?

278
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,584
- Yeah, just don't jinx it, huh?

279
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,252
- Yeah.

280
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:26,208
- Bet this tug's still
crawlin' with krauts.

281
00:18:33,624 --> 00:18:34,792
- What's that?

282
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:40,916
- It's a doll.

283
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,540
- It's really old.

284
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,252
- Spooky.

285
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,708
It's an antique.

286
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,376
- Oh, you're some
kind of expert are ya?

287
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:57,376
- An antique dealer actually
in another life before the war.

288
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,584
- Of course you were, Gerard.

289
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,792
- May I?

290
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,208
Oh.

291
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:14,832
Pierre-Francois Jumeau,
finest doll makers in Paris.

292
00:19:14,832 --> 00:19:16,752
Hm, 1780 - 1830 I'd say.

293
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,624
- Is it worth anything?

294
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:23,460
- A thousand pounds.

295
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,376
Perhaps more at auction.

296
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:27,916
- Well that's a whole lotta
clams for a kid's toy.

297
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:31,708
- What the hell's it doin' here?

298
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,040
- Jackson?

299
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:50,124
How do you feel
about switchin' sides?

300
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:51,416
- Hey, if it means us gettin'

301
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,540
out of these wet
drawers sign me up.

302
00:19:57,876 --> 00:20:00,960
All
there is I'm afraid.

303
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,584
- Man, how many
times you been shot?

304
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,708
- Not all bullets.

305
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:25,000
Some is knife,
some is cigarette.

306
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,500
This one wild pig.

307
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:29,668
It's long story.

308
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:33,752
- Oh my...

309
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:38,292
Sorry.

310
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:39,208
- Don't be.

311
00:20:41,168 --> 00:20:42,416
Just a scratch.

312
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,916
- Where'd you get those?

313
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,584
- Tobruk.

314
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:51,832
Panzer division.

315
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:55,040
Blasted us to buggery.

316
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,208
- All that time of the life boat

317
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,124
and you didn't say anything.

318
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,040
- Three years as a POW.

319
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,332
Not much to tell.

320
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,752
Shelly, my wife.

321
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:18,208
They told her I was killed
in action, so she remarried.

322
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,584
She's happy.

323
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:23,708
She's had a baby.

324
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,292
Few months old now.

325
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:30,584
I wanna see her
just one last time.

326
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,624
Don't blame her for movin' on.

327
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,376
Life's too short.

328
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:40,292
It's too bloody short.

329
00:21:46,252 --> 00:21:47,624
- You'll see her again.

330
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,168
- What about you tough guy?

331
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:55,584
You got family?

332
00:21:57,832 --> 00:21:59,000
- Not anymore.

333
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,040
I'm
sorry to hear that.

334
00:22:10,252 --> 00:22:12,252
- Such small feet these Nazis.

335
00:22:20,332 --> 00:22:23,752
- Boiler room, ammunitions,
galley, radio room.

336
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:26,752
Let's see if we can reach
anyone on the shortwave.

337
00:22:26,752 --> 00:22:27,752
- All right.

338
00:22:27,752 --> 00:22:28,624
I wanna take a
look at the engine

339
00:22:28,624 --> 00:22:31,792
and see what's
keepin' her runnin'.

340
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:34,168
- No offence Jackson
but you're a cook.

341
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:36,960
- Oh yeah, he's a real demon
with the ladle this guy.

342
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,792
- I worked in a
shipyard before the war

343
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:40,292
and the mechanics before that.

344
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,124
- Okay then.

345
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:42,168
- Remind me, what did you do
- Okay.

346
00:22:42,168 --> 00:22:44,460
- before slingin'
last week Bigelow?

347
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,292
- Two groups.

348
00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:48,084
Jackson, Bigelow
with uh, Teplov.

349
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:50,832
Miss Prescott and
Faraday with me.

350
00:22:50,832 --> 00:22:52,332
Meet back in the
galley when we're done.

351
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:53,752
- All right then.

352
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:56,624
- Bloody Yanks.

353
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:28,500
- German.

354
00:23:30,332 --> 00:23:31,168
- Do you know
what they're saying?

355
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,124
- Bits and pieces.

356
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,584
- I think they're
looking for this ship.

357
00:23:42,876 --> 00:23:44,208
- Don't be daft, say something.

358
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,708
Just speak, go on.

359
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,416
- We're on a German ship
without any Germans on it

360
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:53,084
and you wanna just
invite some along.

361
00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:54,540
Go on genius.

362
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,876
- Mm, brilliant.

363
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:02,460
- Must be someone else.

364
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:13,040
- Oh, not good.

365
00:24:14,168 --> 00:24:15,584
This is not good.

366
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,708
- You care to uh, humour me
with specifics Mr. Jackson?

367
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:23,124
- Uh, the boiler
must be runnin' dry.

368
00:24:23,124 --> 00:24:25,208
Engine pressure's
through the roof.

369
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,332
- So, who gives a shit?

370
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,332
- Look, if the boiler
runs dry and the engine

371
00:24:28,332 --> 00:24:30,460
is still running it could
set off a chain reaction.

372
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,168
If it reaches the
munitions room,

373
00:24:33,168 --> 00:24:35,500
it can blow this
whole ship to pieces.

374
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,584
This tub's a ticking time bomb.

375
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:38,832
- So turn it off.

376
00:24:38,832 --> 00:24:40,168
- That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

377
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:41,668
- No, hold the fuck up.

378
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:43,252
You're not shuttin'
this ship down.

379
00:24:43,252 --> 00:24:44,832
- Look we don't know how
much fuel we got left.

380
00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:45,832
A day, maybe less.

381
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:47,416
We can always
turn it back on once

382
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:48,960
we realise where
the hell we're goin'.

383
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,168
Teplov, grab that other wheel.

384
00:24:50,168 --> 00:24:52,668
- Don't fuckin' touch
that wheel, okay?

385
00:24:52,668 --> 00:24:54,124
Listen to me, listen to me.

386
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:55,916
If you shut it off
how do we know

387
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,208
we're gonna turn it back on?

388
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:58,252
- I'd rather be
dead in the water

389
00:24:58,252 --> 00:25:00,416
then literally
dead in the water.

390
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,252
Wouldn't you?

391
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,040
Teplov, grab that wheel.

392
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,832
- Fuck that, no.

393
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:07,292
- God damn it.

394
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:09,668
Listen, I have been
smiling through

395
00:25:09,668 --> 00:25:13,168
your bullshit for
two and a half years.

396
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:16,040
Do you see me smilin' now?

397
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,584
Look, you're not
my boss anymore.

398
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:20,792
Down here what I say goes.

399
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,208
You can try to stop me but
I wouldn't recommend it.

400
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,124
Do we have ourselves
an understanding?

401
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,376
You gravy?

402
00:25:57,252 --> 00:25:58,084
- Gravy.

403
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,500
- Three, two, one.

404
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,500
- Jackson.

405
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,376
- What the?

406
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
All right, that's it.

407
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,332
Fuck this thing.

408
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:35,876
I want off this God damn ride.

409
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:37,876
- Sweet mother of mercy.

410
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:42,084
Not again.

411
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:43,292
- What?

412
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:45,208
What do you mean not again?

413
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:47,584
What, is there somethin'
you're not tellin' me Bigelow?

414
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:49,832
- German sailor on bridge.

415
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:51,376
- And you didn't say anything?

416
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,752
- It was Sinclair's
idea all right?

417
00:26:52,752 --> 00:26:56,000
He told us not to say anything
until we knew what it meant.

418
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,124
- It meant somethin'
bad Bigelow.

419
00:26:58,124 --> 00:27:00,376
Damn, I mean dead bodies
usually mean somethin' bad.

420
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:24,292
- That's two weeks old at least.

421
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:25,708
- I've had worse.

422
00:27:27,252 --> 00:27:28,084
- Ah.

423
00:27:30,668 --> 00:27:31,832
- Oi, Jackson?

424
00:27:32,876 --> 00:27:33,876
Why'd you turn the engines off?

425
00:27:33,876 --> 00:27:34,708
- Had to.

426
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,500
The boiler was about to blow.

427
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,084
- We could've
discussed it first, mate.

428
00:27:38,084 --> 00:27:39,416
- That's what I said.

429
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:41,000
- I made the call.

430
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,168
I made the call
just like you did

431
00:27:43,168 --> 00:27:44,876
about the dead
body on the bridge.

432
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:45,708
- What?

433
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:46,584
- Decapitated, right?

434
00:27:46,584 --> 00:27:48,376
With all the funky veins
runnin' through it?

435
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:51,376
Well there's more down in
the engine room burned alive.

436
00:27:51,376 --> 00:27:53,124
- I didn't wanna cause
a panic, Jackson.

437
00:27:55,252 --> 00:27:57,876
- We need to be able to
trust each other, Sinclair.

438
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:58,876
- Yeah we do, Jackson.

439
00:27:58,876 --> 00:27:59,708
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

440
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:00,540
- Stop.

441
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:05,876
While I appreciate your
decision making Mr. Jackson,

442
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:08,624
and your discretion,
Mr. Sinclair,

443
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,124
right now we have food,
clothing and shelter

444
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,752
and it appears we have this
entire boat to ourselves.

445
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:17,792
Our present predicament is
far better than yesterday's.

446
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,376
Who knows what
tomorrow may bring, hey?

447
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:22,168
So for now let's eat.

448
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,416
"An army marches
on its stomach."

449
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:25,292
- Hang on.

450
00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:26,960
Did you just make that up?

451
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,500
- I think you'll find
that's Napoleon Bonaparte.

452
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,624
- You need to eat too Mr.
Faraday, keep your strength up.

453
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:36,540
- You are an absolute
angel Miss Prescott.

454
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,040
- Yeah, and don't choke on it.

455
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:41,916
- Sorry Miss Prescott.

456
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:42,876
- I'm sorry too.

457
00:28:42,876 --> 00:28:45,540
- Can I at least buy you dinner?

458
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:48,084
Wehrmacht's finest.

459
00:28:48,084 --> 00:28:50,752
Thank you Mr. Sinclair.

460
00:28:50,752 --> 00:28:52,960
- Look, there's no um...

461
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,252
- You don't like fish mate?

462
00:28:54,252 --> 00:28:55,084
- There's no ring.

463
00:28:55,084 --> 00:28:56,000
- That's all you're
getting mate.

464
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,916
Could you
possibly open this?

465
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:58,752
Yes mate.

466
00:29:10,252 --> 00:29:11,084
- What was it?

467
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Some kind of
child or somethin'.
- A child?
Yeah, a child who
scared the shit out of me.
Okay come
on, come on guys.

468
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,376
Oh.

469
00:29:47,624 --> 00:29:51,332
Oh.

470
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,416
Someone hacked
the lifeboats to bits.

471
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:59,124
- Excuse me?

472
00:29:59,124 --> 00:30:01,124
Why would he do that?

473
00:30:01,124 --> 00:30:03,376
- So nobody could leave.

474
00:30:03,376 --> 00:30:06,708
- Hey, please don't
think about it Ivan.

475
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:09,040
- Gasoline.

476
00:30:13,252 --> 00:30:14,708
- He's right.

477
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:16,376
It smells like fuel.

478
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,376
Marvellous.

479
00:30:21,376 --> 00:30:22,208
Marvellous.

480
00:30:23,084 --> 00:30:26,708
So, so, mad captain
loses his marbles,

481
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:29,252
gets a bit axe
happy with his men,

482
00:30:29,252 --> 00:30:31,708
sets them on fire
and then sabotages

483
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:34,500
their only means of escape.

484
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,292
Not to mention ours.

485
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,124
- Shut up Faraday.

486
00:30:37,124 --> 00:30:37,960
- Yeah.

487
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:42,376
- But then who did this to him?

488
00:30:44,084 --> 00:30:44,916
- Rats.

489
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:47,916
Big rats.

490
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:03,460
Miss Prescott?

491
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:08,416
- Hello darling.

492
00:31:10,332 --> 00:31:11,500
Is this yours?

493
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:14,252
Don't be scared.

494
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,460
It's all right.

495
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,876
Ow.

496
00:31:28,876 --> 00:31:30,292
Did she bite you?

497
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:31,124
It's fine.

498
00:31:31,124 --> 00:31:31,960
Just a scratch.

499
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
- Little monster.

500
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,876
- Who knows how long she's
been here on her own,

501
00:31:35,876 --> 00:31:38,460
or what she's been
through poor thing.

502
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:41,460
It's okay.

503
00:31:50,332 --> 00:31:51,752
We're scared too.

504
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:54,876
We're
not gonna hurt you.

505
00:32:05,168 --> 00:32:06,084
- That's family.

506
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:08,040
- What's that?

507
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,252
- Uh, sounds Italian.

508
00:32:09,252 --> 00:32:10,876
Somethin' about family.

509
00:32:10,876 --> 00:32:12,416
Family is.

510
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:14,208
- Okay, so she's
speakin' Italian?

511
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:17,208
- No, no, no, no it just,
not it's not Italian.

512
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:18,708
It just sounds similar.

513
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:19,624
- Romanian.

514
00:32:21,668 --> 00:32:22,876
I recognise it.

515
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:30,040
- Hey, once bitten...

516
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,460
- It's okay.

517
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,208
Oh.

518
00:32:43,168 --> 00:32:44,000
Hm.

519
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:46,540
- What is that?

520
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,668
That looks old.

521
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:53,500
Looks like it's worth somethin'.

522
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,332
What?

523
00:32:54,332 --> 00:32:56,084
Well, clearly he
doesn't need it.

524
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,540
Now we're talkin'.

525
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,376
Oh.
- Nothing broken

526
00:33:01,376 --> 00:33:02,208
and nothing bruised?

527
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,460
Nasty.

528
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,668
Any bullets?

529
00:33:10,124 --> 00:33:12,376
- About half a dozen maybe.

530
00:33:14,832 --> 00:33:16,124
- Wanna trade?

531
00:33:18,292 --> 00:33:19,208
- Nice try.

532
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,416
- You're okay, hm?

533
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,168
Jane.

534
00:33:26,168 --> 00:33:28,668
Jane.

535
00:33:28,668 --> 00:33:31,540
Yes, that's me, Jane.

536
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,960
- Mya.

537
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,460
- Mya.

538
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,292
- Mya.

539
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:36,124
- Mya.

540
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,500
- I'm sorry, what is happening?

541
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,000
- She wants us to follow her.

542
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,832
- You're honestly gonna go

543
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:49,252
following some
little brat around?

544
00:33:49,252 --> 00:33:51,916
What on earth's she doing
here you bloody fools?

545
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,752
- That's what we're
going to find out.

546
00:33:53,752 --> 00:33:55,040
Come on Gerard.

547
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,668
- Something
happened on this ship,

548
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,540
the ship that you forced me onto

549
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,584
and now despite
all logic and reason

550
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:03,252
you're gonna go
casually exploring.

551
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:04,084
No.

552
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,124
I'll have none of this.

553
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:06,208
I mean, look at him.

554
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,376
He loves casual exploring.

555
00:34:09,624 --> 00:34:10,540
- Yeah.

556
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,376
Well uh, why don't you
hang out with old skipper?

557
00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:18,208
Looks like he uh,
loves antiques mate.

558
00:34:26,752 --> 00:34:28,668
- You want us to go down there?

559
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:30,416
Faraday?

560
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,000
- Wait for me.

561
00:34:35,124 --> 00:34:38,460
- What's Romanian for how
many Nazis are down there?

562
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,500
- Bigelow, why don't you
stay up here with Faraday?

563
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,252
- I like this idea.
- I agree.

564
00:34:43,252 --> 00:34:44,292
- Hey.

565
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:45,124
- Hey.

566
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:45,960
- No wait, Mya?

567
00:34:47,624 --> 00:34:48,460
Mya?

568
00:34:52,252 --> 00:34:55,376
Mya, you can't just run off
like that, it's dangerous.

569
00:35:03,124 --> 00:35:04,168
Don't shit yourself.

570
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,252
- Oh I won't.

571
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:07,668
- God damn.

572
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,832
- Wait.

573
00:35:13,832 --> 00:35:17,916
Yeah, I wouldn't
touch it if I were you.

574
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,292
Gasoline.

575
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:27,668
- Hey, what is it?

576
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,040
What is it?

577
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,376
- Come down and
see for yourself.

578
00:35:43,252 --> 00:35:44,416
- I'll be damned.

579
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:46,376
- Jerry! It's a goddamn Kraut!

580
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,168
- We gotta open it.

581
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:51,752
- Eh, naw.

582
00:35:51,752 --> 00:35:52,708
No we don't.

583
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:53,916
- I think they're gonna open it.

584
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:55,000
- Blithering idiots.

585
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Are you barking mad?

586
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,376
You've got no
idea what's in there.

587
00:35:59,376 --> 00:36:00,708
It could be a trap.

588
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:01,540
- You know, I'm
startin' to think

589
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,168
that shortbread
here has got a point.

590
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:04,916
- Look, put a lid on it Bigelow.

591
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:07,168
This man knows what
happened on this ship.

592
00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:09,584
I'd like to know as
well, wouldn't you?

593
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:12,040
Americana?

594
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,668
- Yeah, yeah Americana, yeah.

595
00:36:14,668 --> 00:36:16,252
- You are Australian.

596
00:36:16,252 --> 00:36:17,752
- He doesn't know
the difference mate.

597
00:36:17,752 --> 00:36:19,792
- We're going to open the door.

598
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,332
Do you understand?

599
00:36:26,624 --> 00:36:27,540
- I can't say.

600
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,376
Yeah.

601
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:31,124
Sure you wanna do this?

602
00:36:31,124 --> 00:36:32,500
- Yeah.

603
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,040
Yeah I do.

604
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,292
- You want me to take gun?

605
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:36,584
- I got it.

606
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:39,708
- If you have to
shoot, don't miss.

607
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:42,124
- If it comes to it, I won't.

608
00:36:43,252 --> 00:36:44,084
- Relax.

609
00:36:46,624 --> 00:36:48,124
Okay.

610
00:37:00,124 --> 00:37:01,792
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!

611
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:02,624
- Put it down.

612
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:03,752
What's happening?

613
00:37:03,752 --> 00:37:04,584
Shut up.

614
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:06,252
- Okay, look at me.
- What?

615
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:07,084
What?

616
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:08,252
- Yeah.

617
00:37:08,252 --> 00:37:09,084
Relax.

618
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,792
Hey, yeah look at me.

619
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:12,624
Put the gun down.

620
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,500
Jackson?

621
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,332
- Shit.

622
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,332
- Yeah?

623
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:19,084
Calm down, calm down.

624
00:37:19,084 --> 00:37:19,916
Jackson, relax.

625
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,460
- We wanna talk, yeah?

626
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,792
Calm down, calm down.

627
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:30,960
- Kind tricks?

628
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,624
- Kind, kind tricks.

629
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:37,460
No tricks.

630
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,540
No tricks.

631
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,376
Yeah.

632
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:42,624
Okay.

633
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,460
Looks like we're
gettin' somewhere.

634
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,332
- That beast!

635
00:37:49,332 --> 00:37:51,124
That beast!

636
00:37:51,124 --> 00:37:51,960
- Huh?

637
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,792
- Put it down!

638
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,624
- Shoot him.

639
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
- What's he sayin' Sinclair?

640
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,332
- He's spooked.

641
00:37:57,332 --> 00:37:58,168
- Well no shit.

642
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:01,000
- Do it!

643
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:05,668
- Do it!
- Sinclair!

644
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:10,668
- It's jammed.

645
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,332
Well, I'd
better get out of the way.

646
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,168
- Where you goin'?

647
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:14,000
- Shoot him!

648
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,500
Shoot him!

649
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,292
- Jackson?

650
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:28,168
- Bloody Jesus, is
anybody alive down there?

651
00:38:28,168 --> 00:38:29,040
Oh man.

652
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,332
- Oh.

653
00:38:33,332 --> 00:38:34,708
- Anything else up your sleeve?

654
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,876
Here.

655
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:41,708
Bigelow?

656
00:38:43,792 --> 00:38:44,792
- You're shot.

657
00:38:49,668 --> 00:38:50,916
- I'm fine.

658
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,624
Bigelow?

659
00:39:05,624 --> 00:39:07,292
- Gravy buddy.

660
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:08,124
Gravy.

661
00:39:13,332 --> 00:39:14,332
- Not safe.

662
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:15,168
Just wait.

663
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:18,960
What was he so afraid of?

664
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,416
- Hey ho, can I have a gun?

665
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,292
- You can have the knife.

666
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:38,040
- Actually, I'm okay.

667
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:43,624
Suit yourself.

668
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,960
Well, it looks like Fritz was
plannin' on stayin' awhile.

669
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,792
- Yeah.

670
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,292
Home sweet home.

671
00:40:13,668 --> 00:40:15,416
We need
to apply pressure.

672
00:40:18,084 --> 00:40:20,752
I've had
worse.

673
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,540
This'll work.

674
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,416
Here you go.

675
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:31,416
- Sweet mother Mary.

676
00:40:33,584 --> 00:40:34,668
Hey Sinclair?

677
00:40:35,624 --> 00:40:37,292
We're gonna be rich.

678
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:39,416
- Why?

679
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:45,540
No we won't.

680
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,208
You gotta hold off on
the celebrations mate.

681
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:49,540
- Yeah, but this is
what I'm talkin' about.

682
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,416
This is what I've
been talkin' about man.

683
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,208
This is it.

684
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:56,376
This is lady luck is
finally smilin' down on us.

685
00:40:56,376 --> 00:40:58,500
- Ain't worth Buckley's
if we don't make it home.

686
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,540
What in the devil?

687
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:23,084
We maybe wanna
keep this to ourselves?

688
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:26,084
- Oh yeah, 'cause that
worked so well last time.

689
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:28,084
Actually, you know what?

690
00:41:30,252 --> 00:41:31,416
I'm actually okay with that.

691
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:33,916
We can keep this to ourselves.

692
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,332
- It's just a little bit of
blood Mya, he'll be fine.

693
00:41:44,332 --> 00:41:46,124
- Teplov, big enough?

694
00:41:53,252 --> 00:41:54,708
Here you go.

695
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:55,540
Thank you.

696
00:41:56,584 --> 00:41:58,624
- No, no sorry.

697
00:41:58,624 --> 00:41:59,792
No one.

698
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:02,876
- Yeah uh, just a
couple of old boxes.

699
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:03,708
- Yeah.

700
00:42:04,876 --> 00:42:06,752
Looks like Fritz
was all on his own.

701
00:42:06,752 --> 00:42:08,832
- Well, that's good yes?

702
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:09,668
- Yeah.

703
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:13,000
Except we still don't know why.

704
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,084
- Oh, well first thing's first.

705
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:17,084
I need to get
Alexander to a sickbay.

706
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:36,040
Mya, stop dawdling, hm?

707
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:45,752
Once I get that bullet out
you'll need just a few stitches.

708
00:42:45,752 --> 00:42:47,416
- What I need is a drink.

709
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:48,916
- You and me both.

710
00:42:51,876 --> 00:42:53,168
- Ought to take the sting off.

711
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,708
- Did you see where Gerard went?

712
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:01,540
- Screw him.

713
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,876
He's a deserter.

714
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:06,040
- Wouldn't want
us to look for you?

715
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,252
- I wouldn't go runnin'
off in the first place.

716
00:43:09,084 --> 00:43:10,708
- I'm gonna head back to
the captain's quarters.

717
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:13,540
I'll keep an eye
out for Faraday.

718
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,960
Got one left, if you need it.

719
00:43:18,752 --> 00:43:20,084
Come on Bigelow.

720
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,208
- I never liked these things.

721
00:44:05,124 --> 00:44:08,332
Now, this may sting a little.

722
00:44:23,332 --> 00:44:24,376
- You think that
buckle head down there

723
00:44:24,376 --> 00:44:26,332
just locked himself in there

724
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:28,208
just to get away
from his captain?

725
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,040
- Don't know.

726
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:37,832
- You know, I heard flyboys
talkin' about gremlins

727
00:44:40,124 --> 00:44:43,832
causing all kinds of
trouble for the aircrafts.

728
00:44:43,832 --> 00:44:46,376
It's givin' me the heebie
jeebies just thinkin' about it.

729
00:44:46,376 --> 00:44:47,960
- Gremlins?

730
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,376
- Yeah, gremlins.

731
00:45:05,332 --> 00:45:06,332
- There you go.

732
00:45:06,332 --> 00:45:07,416
That's the worst part over.

733
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,084
- You know, whatever
happened on this ship,

734
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,168
it wasn't gremlins.

735
00:45:14,168 --> 00:45:16,876
It was somethin' far more real.

736
00:45:16,876 --> 00:45:18,584
And ever strange.

737
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,584
- Please, please, please.

738
00:45:21,668 --> 00:45:23,832
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

739
00:45:31,668 --> 00:45:32,832
- Man look.

740
00:45:32,832 --> 00:45:34,000
Fritz from downstairs.

741
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:43,124
I've seen this before.

742
00:45:43,124 --> 00:45:44,916
What's this insignia?

743
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:48,252
- That's some Nazi
voodoo shit right there.

744
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:53,084
That thing's huge.

745
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:53,960
What is that?

746
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,000
That some kind of safe?

747
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,460
- These bastards were makin' off

748
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:01,624
with a fortune and
artwork and artefacts.

749
00:46:01,624 --> 00:46:02,960
- Maybe that was in
those crates downstairs.

750
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,124
Maybe that was...

751
00:46:05,124 --> 00:46:07,624
Maybe there's gold and jewels.

752
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,208
Yeah, nice little Nazi nest egg.

753
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,040
Seemed like it.

754
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:41,832
- Do you think her family's
here on this vessel?

755
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:43,084
- I don't know.

756
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,000
If there's one thing this war's

757
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,168
good for it's making orphans.

758
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,124
- Surely?

759
00:46:54,124 --> 00:46:55,708
Wait.

760
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:56,540
Yes.

761
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:58,252
Yes.

762
00:47:03,252 --> 00:47:04,084
Come on.

763
00:47:04,084 --> 00:47:04,916
Come on.

764
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:06,540
Come on.

765
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,416
Mayday.

766
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:08,540
Mayday.

767
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,668
Can anyone hear me?

768
00:47:11,876 --> 00:47:13,624
Is anybody there?

769
00:47:13,624 --> 00:47:14,584
Mayday.

770
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,416
You said
you had a family?

771
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:20,252
- Yeah.

772
00:47:22,292 --> 00:47:25,292
The Nazis, they
come for my village.

773
00:47:28,876 --> 00:47:31,292
They shoot the old, the weak.

774
00:47:34,624 --> 00:47:37,708
They killed my
father in front of me.

775
00:47:39,916 --> 00:47:42,832
They uh, take my
mother and sister.

776
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,792
I knew I would not
be seeing them again.

777
00:47:55,084 --> 00:47:55,916
- I'm so sorry.

778
00:48:03,752 --> 00:48:04,584
All done.

779
00:48:10,416 --> 00:48:12,752
Let's see how this is going.

780
00:48:16,376 --> 00:48:17,708
- Your daughter?

781
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:20,752
How old was she?

782
00:48:32,584 --> 00:48:36,500
- She would've been 12
this year but the blitz.

783
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:47,040
It's impossible not
to be reminded of her.

784
00:48:49,124 --> 00:48:50,252
You know, part of me's scared of

785
00:48:50,252 --> 00:48:52,916
this war ending
because then I'll go home.

786
00:48:59,124 --> 00:49:02,332
And she won't be
there waiting for me.

787
00:49:02,332 --> 00:49:05,000
My husband, he's lost in Africa.

788
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,584
I know he won't be coming back.

789
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,792
This bloody war,

790
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,752
takes everything from
you, gives you nothing back.

791
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:26,624
- What were they up to?

792
00:49:33,084 --> 00:49:34,668
What the hell is this?

793
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:42,208
Hey Bigelow, look.

794
00:49:48,376 --> 00:49:49,208
Oi?

795
00:49:53,376 --> 00:49:54,208
Bigelow?

796
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,500
- Sorry Mr. Jackson but to
the victor go the spoils.

797
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:13,668
Oh.

798
00:50:13,668 --> 00:50:20,832
Lady luck, you are
one beautiful minx.

799
00:50:51,668 --> 00:50:52,876
I hustled my way out of a war

800
00:50:52,876 --> 00:50:55,208
and I'm still gonna
come out on top.

801
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:31,584
- Bigelow?

802
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:53,708
Bigelow?

803
00:52:01,668 --> 00:52:02,500
- Get fucked.

804
00:52:11,124 --> 00:52:11,960
Bigelow!

805
00:52:47,916 --> 00:52:50,208
- Yes Mya, we'll keep
looking I promise you.

806
00:53:12,668 --> 00:53:14,292
Mya?

807
00:53:43,252 --> 00:53:44,084
- Miss Prescott?

808
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,208
Hey, hey, hey.

809
00:53:52,624 --> 00:53:53,460
You okay?

810
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,208
- Mya, she--

811
00:53:58,208 --> 00:53:59,040
Hey?

812
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,416
- She...

813
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:01,252
- I know.

814
00:54:05,332 --> 00:54:07,332
I need to show you somethin'.

815
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,084
- Mayday.

816
00:54:10,084 --> 00:54:11,000
Um, mayday.

817
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,832
Can anyone hear me?

818
00:54:17,124 --> 00:54:18,332
Mayday.

819
00:54:23,084 --> 00:54:26,040
Yes, yes, yes I can hear you.

820
00:54:30,124 --> 00:54:32,332
- Um, English, English.

821
00:54:32,332 --> 00:54:33,168
Uh...

822
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,208
Speak the English better.

823
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,040
English?

824
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:39,876
- Yes.

825
00:54:40,752 --> 00:54:41,584
Yes.

826
00:54:42,752 --> 00:54:43,752
I'm English.

827
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:49,460
I'm, I'm on one of your vessels.

828
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,832
Anyone else on board?

829
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,416
- Everybody's dead.

830
00:54:55,624 --> 00:54:58,876
The captain went
mad I'm telling you.

831
00:54:58,876 --> 00:55:00,168
What is your position?

832
00:55:00,168 --> 00:55:01,084
- Oh, um...

833
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:09,208
Somewhere...

834
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,916
It's somewhere in
the North Atlantic.

835
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:12,792
I don't know.

836
00:55:12,792 --> 00:55:14,792
I'm not a navigator.

837
00:55:25,832 --> 00:55:27,376
Come in English.

838
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,376
- My name is Gerard Faraday,

839
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:42,208
and I am a code breaker
with British Intelligence.

840
00:55:44,584 --> 00:55:47,332
If you help me,
if you rescue me,

841
00:55:49,792 --> 00:55:53,208
I can provide you
with vital information,

842
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,832
classified information.

843
00:56:08,584 --> 00:56:12,752
Listen my name is Gerard--
- We will send help English.

844
00:56:12,752 --> 00:56:15,252
Stay on the radio.

845
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:18,708
We will attempt to
triangulate your position.

846
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,540
- Thank God.

847
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

848
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:50,124
- My guess is uh, they
brought these caskets onboard.

849
00:57:51,124 --> 00:57:55,292
One of these things got
out, slaughtered the crew.

850
00:57:56,252 --> 00:57:58,540
Mya.

851
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,960
- Yeah, she was the
only one on the ship.

852
00:58:03,168 --> 00:58:06,668
The captain must've figured
out what was goin' on.

853
00:58:06,668 --> 00:58:09,208
Killed as many as he could.

854
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:12,252
Wrecked the life boats,
turned the ship off course.

855
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:44,584
It's these monsters.

856
00:58:45,668 --> 00:58:48,000
This is what killed Bigelow.

857
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,792
This ugly bastard.

858
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:51,624
- Please, please.

859
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,332
It's, it's not possible.

860
00:58:59,252 --> 00:59:00,084
Strigoi.

861
00:59:02,252 --> 00:59:03,084
- What?

862
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:04,752
- Strigoi.

863
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,540
Fairytales.

864
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,540
Something my
grandfather used to tell us.

865
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,124
- This isn't exactly
a fairytale Alexander.

866
00:59:18,084 --> 00:59:19,916
- Strigoi is the living dead.

867
00:59:19,916 --> 00:59:20,752
Shape shifters.

868
00:59:20,752 --> 00:59:24,084
They, they, they
move by night, hunting.

869
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:28,460
Changing shape and appearance.

870
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:32,040
They command armies of
animals and insects.

871
00:59:36,584 --> 00:59:40,000
That's what bedtime stories
to, to frighten children.

872
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,208
- Alexander?

873
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:42,416
Alex?

874
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:43,708
Hey?

875
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:44,540
Hey?

876
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,292
Did these bedtime stories,

877
00:59:48,292 --> 00:59:51,460
did they tell you how
to kill the bastards?

878
00:59:52,752 --> 00:59:53,708
Yeah?

879
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:54,540
Yeah?

880
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,668
- These uh, holy weapons.

881
00:59:56,668 --> 00:59:58,084
Relics and stuff.

882
01:00:00,332 --> 01:00:04,752
- There's a box of this
stuff down in the cargo hold.

883
01:00:05,792 --> 01:00:10,540
It's locked in there with
the one that killed Bigelow.

884
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,376
- Okay.

885
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:16,460
So, only little girl
we have to worry about.

886
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,624
- And Faraday.

887
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,084
He's still out there on his own.

888
01:00:22,832 --> 01:00:24,960
- Let's hope he's as
smart as he thinks he is.

889
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:20,292
- Faraday?

890
01:02:41,084 --> 01:02:41,916
Faraday?

891
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:44,876
- Gerard?

892
01:02:50,668 --> 01:02:51,500
Gerard?

893
01:02:53,668 --> 01:02:55,332
- Faraday?

894
01:02:55,332 --> 01:02:56,168
- Gerard?

895
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,540
- Hey?

896
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:59,540
Gerard?

897
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,376
Gerard?

898
01:03:10,332 --> 01:03:11,168
- Gerard?

899
01:03:19,624 --> 01:03:21,960
- You know nothing of death.

900
01:03:55,752 --> 01:03:59,832
We must show you what it
means to embrace death.

901
01:03:59,832 --> 01:04:01,000
To welcome it,

902
01:04:02,584 --> 01:04:03,832
with open arms.

903
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:21,376
- It is your nature to fear
what you do not understand.

904
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,876
- Gerard, stop.

905
01:04:25,876 --> 01:04:27,168
- Faraday?

906
01:04:27,168 --> 01:04:28,960
- It is not Faraday.

907
01:04:32,376 --> 01:04:33,668
Strigoi.

908
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:42,832
- Wait!

909
01:04:42,832 --> 01:04:43,668
Wait!

910
01:04:43,668 --> 01:04:44,500
Wait!

911
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:49,292
Wait.

912
01:04:50,752 --> 01:04:51,584
- Teplov.

913
01:05:21,832 --> 01:05:23,124
- Do it!

914
01:05:23,124 --> 01:05:23,960
Do it.

915
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:34,084
- You are already dead.

916
01:05:34,084 --> 01:05:36,584
You simply do not know it yet.

917
01:05:38,752 --> 01:05:39,584
- Do it!

918
01:05:48,084 --> 01:05:48,916
- Why?

919
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,168
- You stabbed me.

920
01:06:10,168 --> 01:06:11,832
- Just breathe Gerard, breathe.

921
01:06:14,292 --> 01:06:15,876
I'll get you to sickbay.

922
01:06:15,876 --> 01:06:17,584
You'll be right as rain.

923
01:06:22,876 --> 01:06:23,916
Where are we?

924
01:06:26,084 --> 01:06:28,332
- You're going home Gerard.

925
01:06:31,876 --> 01:06:33,584
- It's autumn there now.

926
01:06:49,668 --> 01:06:52,084
- You did what you had to do.

927
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,540
What is this?

928
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,668
- It's a big fucker.

929
01:07:28,668 --> 01:07:32,084
- All of this because
of one little girl.

930
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,708
What if this big one gets out?

931
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:38,540
We
can't let it happen.

932
01:07:42,668 --> 01:07:44,084
- Let's end this.

933
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:47,752
Mya?

934
01:07:50,624 --> 01:07:51,460
Mya?

935
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:01,124
Mya, where are you?

936
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,040
- Mommy?

937
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:36,540
- Milly?

938
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:38,208
- Mommy, I'm scared.

939
01:09:41,208 --> 01:09:42,376
Mommy, please?

940
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:45,208
- That's my
daughter, that's her.

941
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:47,916
- You can save me this time.

942
01:09:47,916 --> 01:09:48,752
- Milly?

943
01:09:48,752 --> 01:09:49,752
It's not her.

944
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:50,584
It's not her.

945
01:09:50,584 --> 01:09:53,168
- No!
- Mommy let me out please!

946
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:56,624
- Let me in!

947
01:09:56,624 --> 01:09:59,916
- You can save me this
time mommy, please!

948
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:01,168
- Let go of me!

949
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,292
- It's not her!

950
01:10:03,292 --> 01:10:04,460
It's not your daughter.

951
01:10:08,376 --> 01:10:09,208
Do it.

952
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:13,832
Do it!

953
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,460
- Miss Prescott?

954
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,208
I'll meet you at the
captain's quarters.

955
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:46,416
- Right, that'll do.

956
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,252
Sinclair?

957
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:22,460
- Miss Prescott?

958
01:13:37,832 --> 01:13:38,708
Miss Prescott?

959
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Strigoi.

960
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,460
Nathan?

961
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,084
- Jane?

962
01:15:34,084 --> 01:15:34,916
- Nathan?

963
01:15:36,792 --> 01:15:38,084
I'm waiting for you.

964
01:15:42,624 --> 01:15:44,208
Come to me my darling.

965
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:53,916
I've been waiting so long.

966
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:54,752
So long.

967
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,292
- Shelly?

968
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,460
- Come back to me husband.

969
01:16:03,584 --> 01:16:04,624
Come.

970
01:16:04,624 --> 01:16:05,708
Come back to me husband.

971
01:16:05,708 --> 01:16:06,540
Come.

972
01:16:09,668 --> 01:16:11,876
We'll be together again.

973
01:16:11,876 --> 01:16:13,584
We'll be together again.

974
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:29,168
- But that other fella?

975
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:31,252
I thought I lost you.

976
01:16:31,252 --> 01:16:32,708
- I'm right here.

977
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,500
- I've been waiting a long time.

978
01:16:39,792 --> 01:16:40,624
- Sinclair!

979
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:11,208
Sinclair?

980
01:17:23,332 --> 01:17:24,500
- Wait for me.

981
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:30,000
What are you doing?

982
01:17:32,332 --> 01:17:33,168
Why?

983
01:17:33,168 --> 01:17:34,000
Why?

984
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,500
Why?

985
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,040
- They are not
so easy to kill, no?

986
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:24,876
- Not so easy to kill, no.

987
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:30,000
- You hurt?

988
01:18:32,832 --> 01:18:34,500
I've been through worse.

989
01:18:38,124 --> 01:18:40,000
Miss Prescott?

990
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:42,540
Ship.

991
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:44,708
- The flare.

992
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:45,624
Teplov, again.

993
01:18:45,624 --> 01:18:46,460
Signal the ship.

994
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:49,000
- No, that was last one.

995
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,084
What if it is German, hm?

996
01:18:52,376 --> 01:18:54,332
- Better for the Nazis.

997
01:18:54,332 --> 01:18:55,460
Piece of piss mate.

998
01:18:59,584 --> 01:19:00,416
Strigoi.

999
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:05,000
We can't let the
Strigoi off the ship.

1000
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,668
We won't.

1001
01:19:07,584 --> 01:19:09,668
- We gotta find Miss Prescott.

1002
01:19:09,668 --> 01:19:13,960
- Find Miss Prescott,
signal ship, kill Strigoi.

1003
01:19:17,668 --> 01:19:19,252
- What's your plan?

1004
01:19:20,792 --> 01:19:22,124
- We blow it up.

1005
01:19:23,376 --> 01:19:24,916
We blow up ship.

1006
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:26,792
- We find Miss Prescott.

1007
01:19:26,792 --> 01:19:30,752
- Jackson, he said chain
reaction could blow up ship.

1008
01:19:30,752 --> 01:19:32,416
We get to munitions room,

1009
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:35,668
we detonate shell,
blow up boiler, boom.

1010
01:19:37,376 --> 01:19:38,668
- You're right, boom.

1011
01:19:38,668 --> 01:19:39,500
- Yeah?

1012
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,832
- You're as mad as a cut snake.

1013
01:19:43,832 --> 01:19:45,292
- Piece of piss mate.

1014
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,208
- That looks promising.

1015
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:45,376
Got another plan?

1016
01:21:49,332 --> 01:21:50,332
- Open door.

1017
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:55,416
- Teplov and
Sinclair: Kill Strigoi.

1018
01:21:55,416 --> 01:22:00,416
- All right, well I've been
killin' monsters for years.

1019
01:22:00,792 --> 01:22:02,376
A few more won't hurt.

1020
01:22:05,624 --> 01:22:07,916
Can't promise you're not
gonna get anymore scars.

1021
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:11,332
- Yeah, more
scars, more stories.

1022
01:22:11,332 --> 01:22:13,000
- That's the spirit.

1023
01:22:17,084 --> 01:22:18,084
Wanna trade?

1024
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,332
- No.

1025
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,124
- Hey.

1026
01:23:30,584 --> 01:23:34,500
Now we know what happened
to the crew.

1027
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:37,292
- And what we will happen to me.

1028
01:23:37,292 --> 01:23:38,668
- What?

1029
01:23:38,668 --> 01:23:41,208
- Bite marks like this.

1030
01:23:41,208 --> 01:23:44,040
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, naw.

1031
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,208
- I think when Strigoi attack,

1032
01:23:46,208 --> 01:23:49,876
what doesn't kill you
makes you one of them.

1033
01:23:51,792 --> 01:23:52,624
So--

1034
01:23:52,624 --> 01:23:54,040
- So no, come on.
- No, no, no, no,

1035
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,752
- Come on!
- no, no, no, no.

1036
01:23:55,752 --> 01:23:57,832
You go all right?

1037
01:23:57,832 --> 01:23:59,752
You find Miss Prescott.

1038
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:03,540
I will set off explosion.

1039
01:24:04,876 --> 01:24:05,708
- No, no.

1040
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:06,540
- Yes.
- No.

1041
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:07,376
- Yes.

1042
01:24:08,416 --> 01:24:09,252
Please.

1043
01:24:11,084 --> 01:24:11,916
- Mate.

1044
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,708
- I hope you see
your wife again.

1045
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:19,540
No.

1046
01:24:20,584 --> 01:24:21,708
I hope she's happy.

1047
01:24:25,752 --> 01:24:27,252
You tell her baby,

1048
01:24:29,668 --> 01:24:34,124
there are not so many
monsters in the world today,

1049
01:24:34,124 --> 01:24:36,124
as there were yesterday.

1050
01:24:37,624 --> 01:24:38,584
Okay?

1051
01:24:38,584 --> 01:24:39,416
You tell her.

1052
01:25:27,708 --> 01:25:28,916
- Whoa!

1053
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:29,752
Jane?

1054
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,292
Come on, come on, come on!

1055
01:25:33,292 --> 01:25:34,708
- No, Nathan!
- Come on.

1056
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:35,540
What?

1057
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,376
- No.
- What?

1058
01:25:36,376 --> 01:25:38,960
- Oh, are you all right?

1059
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,040
- It's not my blood.

1060
01:25:43,584 --> 01:25:45,332
Come on, come on, come on.

1061
01:25:45,332 --> 01:25:46,960
- No, Nathan?

1062
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,000
What?

1063
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:48,832
What's wrong?

1064
01:25:51,208 --> 01:25:52,040
Come on.

1065
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,168
We're not beat yet.

1066
01:25:53,168 --> 01:25:54,332
We ain't beat yet.

1067
01:25:54,332 --> 01:25:55,668
Come on!

1068
01:25:57,792 --> 01:25:58,832
We gotta find the ship.

1069
01:25:58,832 --> 01:25:59,668
Come on.

1070
01:26:06,252 --> 01:26:07,084
- Jane come on.

1071
01:26:07,084 --> 01:26:09,292
Come on, Teplov's
gonna blow the ship.

1072
01:26:09,292 --> 01:26:10,208
- What?
- Come on.

1073
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:32,624
We don't have time.

1074
01:26:32,624 --> 01:26:33,460
Come on!

1075
01:26:36,124 --> 01:26:36,960
I can see it!

1076
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,124
We have to jump.

1077
01:26:53,124 --> 01:26:54,332
- No, I can't.

1078
01:26:54,332 --> 01:26:55,792
We
don't have a choice.

1079
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:15,960
- You have to leave me.

1080
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,168
- What are you talking about?

1081
01:27:45,376 --> 01:27:46,208
- No!

1082
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,540
- Miss Prescott?

1083
01:28:31,252 --> 01:28:32,540
Miss Prescott?

1084
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:33,708
Miss Prescott?

1085
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,460
Miss?

1086
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:38,752
Look, look a ship!

1087
01:28:38,752 --> 01:28:39,832
It's a ship.

1088
01:28:39,832 --> 01:28:40,668
Miss Prescott?

1089
01:28:40,668 --> 01:28:42,752
It's British.

1090
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,584
Hey, hey!

1091
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:45,792
Hey!

1092
01:28:50,376 --> 01:28:51,752
You okay?

1093
01:29:47,168 --> 01:29:50,832
Let the
medic through.

1094
01:29:50,832 --> 01:29:52,876
Stand aside
gentlemen, give her a hand.

1095
01:29:52,876 --> 01:29:54,460
- There.
- Bring this there.

1096
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:56,168
- You're safe now Miss.

1097
01:29:56,168 --> 01:29:59,752
Did anybody else
make it off alive?

1098
01:29:59,752 --> 01:30:01,252
- No.

1099
01:30:01,252 --> 01:30:02,084
Only me.

1100
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:09,540
This bloody war.
