1
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,708
Well?

2
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,958
Sir, I just want to come back
and finish my studies.

3
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:32,633
Being a doctor and serving society
has always been my main goal in life.

4
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:37,627
I don't want my future destroyed
because of one mistake.

5
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:38,877
So, do you admit it?

6
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:40,377
Admit what?

7
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:41,997
What you've done.

8
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:47,748
Well, I don't know the details of my case

9
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,713
but I guess the reason I can't return
is because I was politically active.

10
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,000
But sir, everyone was politically active
during the revolution.

11
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,540
I was young.
Naive.

12
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:03,253
I mean, I didn't even understand
the difference between left and right.

13
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:06,172
I was just passionate
like everyone else that age.

14
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:09,672
I was concerned about the country.
I wanted change.

15
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:12,997
I'm sure you understand.

16
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:16,792
If I ended up
in one of those radical left groups...

17
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:20,213
It was only because
i didn't know any better...

18
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:25,292
Every mistake has consequences.

19
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,633
I let you in so you could hear this
directly from my lips

20
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,077
and stop wasting your time
by coming here every day.

21
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:34,205
Let me tell you this frankly.

22
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,500
You cannot continue your studies.

23
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:39,832
Based on your history, there is not even
the slightest possibility

24
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:45,075
that you can ever return
to the university.

25
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,495
I suggest you find a new goal in life.

26
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,922
- Hello, Mrs. fakur.
- Hello, dear.

27
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,208
Sorry, I'm late.
I hope dorsa wasn't any trouble?

28
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,000
No trouble at all.
We had fun.

29
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,502
Dorsa! Mum!

30
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,498
- What happened?
- Mummy.

31
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,542
Oh, darling

32
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,172
it's okay.

33
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:17,288
It's okay. I understand.
That's the climate right now.

34
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,333
Don't let it change you.

35
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,170
To my daughter.

36
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,498
Congratulations
on beginning medical school.

37
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:55,382
I'm proud of you.
Your loving mother.

38
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,670
Hello? Anyone home?

39
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:29,037
Dad, dad, dad, dad!

40
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,383
Hello, little one.

41
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:33,917
Where's mum?

42
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:38,292
She's in the bedroom.

43
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:42,753
She's grumpy.

44
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,542
Hello...

45
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,633
Hello...

46
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:52,827
What are you doing?

47
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,918
Those are my course books.

48
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,495
Give them away to someone
who wants them. Or Chuck them.

49
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,290
Go and play dorsa.

50
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,083
What happened?

51
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:30,827
Maybe things will get better
after the war.

52
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,248
There's no guarantee.

53
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,168
And this war seems to be never ending.

54
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:47,035
Well, you've tried your best.

55
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,875
It's out of your hands now.

56
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,963
Who knows? It's probably for the best.

57
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,247
Dorsa! Run!

58
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,077
Where are you going?

59
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:13,132
- There is no time, we have to go
downstairs! - We can't leave kimia behind.

60
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,923
Come on.

61
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:28,082
Hello.
Hello.

62
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,325
Thank you, doctor.

63
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:33,825
- Sorry for the trouble.
- Not at all.

64
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:42,752
Thank god, sounds like they've put
more defenses around Tehran.

65
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:48,212
I heard a rumor that Iraq
is launching missiles now...

66
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,583
Leave her alone.

67
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,285
Dorsa,
come here, sweetheart.

68
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,168
Who's this new boy?

69
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:09,748
Mr. ebrahimi's nephew. Apparently
he lost his parents in the abadan.

70
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:19,422
Dad?

71
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,128
Dad?

72
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,875
Dad?

73
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,543
What happened, sweetheart?

74
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,082
Did you have a bad dream?

75
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:46,632
It's okay.

76
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,633
No, dear, those things don't exist.

77
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:58,747
Next time you're scared,
remember that you're not on your own.

78
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:03,252
I gave you kimia to keep you company.

79
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,415
Good morning.

80
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,672
No toys at the breakfast table please.

81
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,252
Good morning.

82
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:17,792
The tape on the windows is coming off.

83
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:24,043
- What if the windows shatter in a
blast... - I'll re-tape them.

84
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,875
Did you have a nightmare last night?

85
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:33,747
She said she heard someone
walking in the house.

86
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,292
You're a bad sleeper
just like your mother.

87
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,375
Did you sleep okay last night?

88
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,287
Me?

89
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,713
Why do you think I'm sleepwalking again?

90
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,170
You would have noticed.

91
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,287
I was out cold.

92
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,883
Just because I did it once or twice

93
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:54,747
like six months ago,
doesn't mean it's a constant thing.

94
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:59,752
Plus this is not the first time dorsa has
had a nightmare and imagined things.

95
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:04,502
I'm just saying you're only a bad sleeper
when you're stressed.

96
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,208
What's that?

97
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,577
It's my...

98
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,535
Annual draft notice.

99
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:30,172
Why didn't you mention it sooner?

100
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:34,825
You've had other things on your mind.

101
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:40,285
I'm going to the ministry of health later
today to see where I'm stationed.

102
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:44,832
Might get somewhere safe
like last year...

103
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:47,497
If we're lucky...

104
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:44,707
Hey, doctor.

105
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,000
- A minute please...
- Hello.

106
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:51,252
- Hello... how is your family?
- Good, thank you.

107
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:55,212
How many times do I have to ask for
the garage door to be closed properly?

108
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,380
- Please remind your wife...
- What do you mean?

109
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:01,707
Let me show you.

110
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,040
The bolt has rusted.

111
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:11,673
- It takes force to put it in place...
- How do you know it was my wife?

112
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,538
It's not you or me.

113
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,293
I know Mr. fakur closes it properly.

114
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:19,043
And none of the women in the
building drive, apart from your wife.

115
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,633
Right. We'll remember
to close the door properly.

116
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,247
Have a good day.

117
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,128
Hello.

118
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,460
Hello.

119
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,325
They're sending me to elam.

120
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,210
That's in the middle of the fighting.

121
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,540
I tried for a safer post
but it didn't work out.

122
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:18,292
I think you and dorsa
should go to my parents.

123
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,383
Why?

124
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,670
The rumors about Iraq using
missiles are probably true.

125
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,708
It's safer up north.
People are already leaving the city.

126
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,830
We're fine here.

127
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:32,832
You don't get a warning with missiles.

128
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,205
I'm not going to be
a burden to your parents.

129
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,500
You're not a burden.

130
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,582
Last time we went there
your sisters kept saying

131
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,245
"Tehran gets bombed
and we get the shrapnel."

132
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:45,172
We'll be fine in our own home.

133
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,708
I'm worried about dorsa.

134
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,920
What? Am I not capable
of looking after my own child now?

135
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:57,877
That's not what I'm saying.

136
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:03,165
All I'm saying is I won't be around.

137
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:07,208
At my parents', you can
at least have that support.

138
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,000
Ah, because you've been so supportive
until now...

139
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,712
That's unfair.

140
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:20,420
No, unfair is you swanking off
to play doctors and treating me like...

141
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,038
I'm incompetent.

142
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,253
Play doctors?

143
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:26,212
Being shipped off to war is not a game.

144
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,503
Are you showing off?
Do you want a medal?

145
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,042
I'm not going out of choice.
I'd lose my right to practice...

146
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,793
If you don't have the right
to practice, it's a catastrophe

147
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,923
but if I don't it's for the best.

148
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,168
Are you mad that I'm practicing?

149
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,168
No, I'm not mad about that...

150
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:45,918
Dorsa, how many times have I told you
to put your toys away after playing?

151
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:09,752
Is it my fault
you can't finish your studies?

152
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:16,250
Didn't you waste your time
on politics at university?

153
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:19,292
You sound exactly like them.

154
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,830
Am I wrong?

155
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:30,420
Have you forgotten that you kept calling
me spineless for sticking to my studies?

156
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,208
Like you never tried
to stop me studying.

157
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,880
When did I ever do that?

158
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:38,207
When the universities reopened
after the cultural revolution

159
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:42,130
who was it that told me studying could
wait, stay home and raise the child?

160
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,285
Do you have a problem
looking after your child?

161
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,793
Are you calling me a bad mother?

162
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:57,667
No. I'm saying don't blame your
shortcomings on me and our child.

163
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,038
Tell me, why do you want
to go back now, all of a sudden?

164
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,543
I didn't leave out of choice.
The cultural revolution happened.

165
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:07,883
That was four, five years ago.
The universities reopened after a year.

166
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:08,917
So?

167
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:12,168
You only want to go back now
because your mother died...

168
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,748
Becoming a doctor has
always been my dream!

169
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:17,922
No, shideh, it's your mother's dream.

170
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,377
Dead people can't dream.

171
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,502
I'll be scared without you here.

172
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:47,672
I'll be back before you know it!

173
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:56,038
Mum is going to take you to granny's.

174
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,290
Here's this month's rent
and what we owed from last month.

175
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,083
Give it to ebrahimi
when it's due to shut him up.

176
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,420
Mum...

177
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,500
Mum...

178
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,880
Mum...

179
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,747
Yes?

180
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:13,752
My bed is wet.

181
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,667
Get up.

182
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,543
You still have to wet yourself
at this age!

183
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,883
Aren't you going to school
next year?

184
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,828
Go to the bathroom,
take your clothes off.

185
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,633
Didn't I say go to the bathroom?

186
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm scared to go alone...

187
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,625
Your toast.

188
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,668
Mummy?

189
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:15,328
Now that dad is not here...
Can I sleep next to you at night?

190
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,455
Aren't you a big girl?

191
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,920
Big girls don't wet the bed either.

192
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:25,127
Why do you have trouble sleeping?

193
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:31,462
Well?
Tell me. What are you scared of?

194
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,375
Hey?

195
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,745
Djinn...

196
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,422
Djinn aren't real...

197
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,578
They are. We just can't see them.

198
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,785
- Who told you that?
- Mehdi.

199
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,793
Who's mehdi?

200
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,793
Sogand and Ali's cousin.

201
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:57,210
He gave me a ball of magical cat
fur to protect myself from them.

202
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,750
But I lost it.

203
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:01,537
Drink properly.

204
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:08,293
Djinn are just a fairytale made
up to scare little children.

205
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:14,917
Mehdi said djinn are real.
They're evil and want to hurt us...

206
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,168
Mehdi is talking nonsense.

207
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:30,127
- Hello, Mrs. ebrahimi.
- Hello...

208
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:33,127
- I hope it's not a bad time.
- Not at all. Please come in.

209
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,577
No, thanks. I just
have a small request...

210
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,915
- Your relative...
- Mehdi?

211
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:42,918
He has been telling scary
stories to my daughter, dorsa.

212
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,998
I know he's just a child,
it's nothing spiteful

213
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:49,132
but dorsa is having real
trouble sleeping at night.

214
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:54,037
Please ask him not to tell
dorsa those kind of stories...

215
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,083
Your daughter has made a mistake.

216
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,785
Mehdi is mute.

217
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,503
He hasn't said a word
since he lost his parents.

218
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:05,132
They both got killed.

219
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:07,497
Ebrahimi took him
to so many different doctors.

220
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:09,132
But no result.

221
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:12,497
- She said mehdi told her...
- Has she said what stories?

222
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:16,422
- Djinn and stuff...
- Oh, god, have mercy!

223
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,168
Djinn aren't Mrs. ebrahimi...

224
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,288
They are very real.
It's even in the quran.

225
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:28,458
My husband gets angry when I say this,
but the boy is creepy...

226
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:37,213
- You're back early.
- Mrs. ebrahimi sent me back upstairs.

227
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,882
Didn't she say why?

228
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:47,043
She took sogand and Ali home
and told me to go home too.

229
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,213
What about mehdi?

230
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:00,000
Mehdi's allowed to stay.

231
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:02,542
But we can't play with him anymore.

232
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:12,497
You know, the stories you
mentioned this morning...

233
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,252
Are you sure it was mehdi that told
them to you and not the ebrahimi kids?

234
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:20,212
Well, sogand and Ali
also tell me stories.

235
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,830
Why be careful?

236
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,955
Because they're coming.

237
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:29,287
Did he say that
in front of the ebrahimi kids?

238
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,793
No, he whispered it in my ear.

239
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,380
Oh my, we've talked so much.
Your tea is getting cold.

240
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:42,877
You are right. Sorry.

241
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:45,747
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

242
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:50,208
What lovely tea you've made.

243
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,710
I didn't know that you
could make such tasty tea.

244
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,330
Thank you.

245
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,833
- Have some bread too.
- Yes, yes, I will.

246
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,628
Hello?

247
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,917
Hello?

248
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,038
- Shideh?
- Hello.

249
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:20,423
- Can you hear me?
- The line isn't great but it's okay.

250
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,748
- How are you?
- We're fine. How is it over there?

251
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:25,002
Not great.

252
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:28,382
Either working in the hospital
or taking shelter.

253
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,375
You still don't want to go
to my parents?

254
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:33,417
Don't worry about us.

255
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:38,918
The foreign radios are saying Iraq claims
they'll level Tehran with missiles soon.

256
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:41,078
Nothing has been reported here.

257
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,575
Please take dorsa out of the city.

258
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:46,535
I'm not abandoning my home
based on a rumor.

259
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:50,458
- Not even for dorsa?
- Dorsa is better off in her own home.

260
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:55,245
I have to go.
Think about what I said.

261
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,830
I miss you.

262
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:01,292
- Bye.
- I miss you too...

263
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:06,132
400 miles from the battlefield...

264
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:10,287
Tehran will become the new front line
for the ongoing Iran-Iraq war.

265
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,833
Iraq has started launching missiles,
reaching out...

266
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:15,825
- Where did you go, ma'am?
Your tea is getting cold. - Hold on.

267
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,785
Many iranians have already left the
capital... - What about our tea party?

268
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:22,923
- Playtime is over
- it's not. It's not. It's not.

269
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:27,748
Enough!
When I say playtime's over, I mean it!

270
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,382
If you don't listen to me

271
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:32,417
next time I'll take kimia away
so you can't play with her.

272
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:35,788
- Understand?
- Did it hurt?

273
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:40,213
It's okay. I'm here.
I'll look after you.

274
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,043
Dorsa!

275
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,753
Come here please.

276
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:00,332
Are you still mad at me?

277
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,075
We need to go downstairs right now!

278
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

279
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,575
Dorsa!

280
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,495
Dorsa!

281
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,667
Somebody...

282
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:48,918
Help me!

283
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:51,708
Please!

284
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:56,713
Dorsa?
Sweetheart?

285
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,000
Dorsa?

286
00:26:58,042 --> 00:26:59,752
Dorsa?
Sweetheart?

287
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:03,172
Please answer me...

288
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:08,213
Oh, my sweetheart...

289
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:14,248
- I saw them. They're real.
They were scary. - Saw who?

290
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:18,172
- I saw them...
- What are you talking about? Shideh.

291
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:21,038
Please... my dad...
My dad is dying.

292
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:24,253
- Please help.
- Mum! Don't leave me!

293
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:29,212
Please! Help my father!
Save my dad. You're a doctor. You can.

294
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,710
- But I'm not a doctor...
- Mum! Don't go!

295
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:40,420
- I'll look after dorsa. Go.
- No, mum! No!

296
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:55,537
Come here.
He's here. Hurry!

297
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:59,383
- Mr. bijari?
- Father!

298
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,920
Let's take him out of here.

299
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:06,828
We can't be here.
This missile might still explode!

300
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:10,575
Go and call an ambulance!
If I don't do cpr now, he'll die.

301
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:14,205
Dad... my poor dad...
Come on.

302
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,288
Come on.

303
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,583
Come.

304
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:40,288
Paramedics.
It's safe, you can come up.

305
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:52,922
If I was a real doctor,
he might still be alive.

306
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,128
Why do you say this?

307
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:57,577
You did everything you could.

308
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:04,832
- What's going on?
- Nothing, darling. Go back to sleep.

309
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,288
She's not here!

310
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:41,878
Kimia...
Kimia is not here.

311
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:44,627
- Where was it before?
- On the bed...

312
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:53,828
- They took her.
- Nobody took it.

313
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:55,575
It's probably around here somewhere...

314
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:58,417
Are you okay?

315
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,535
You're so hot!

316
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:06,793
Oh, my baby...
My sweet, baby girl...

317
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:10,083
They came and saw
she was alone and took her.

318
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:14,205
Don't worry.
You should rest for now.

319
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,920
Take your shoes off.

320
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,210
Keep warm and rest
until your fever breaks.

321
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,630
I promise to find her.
Okay?

322
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:29,583
Mum, I had a bad dream.

323
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:41,125
Don't be afraid.

324
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:46,833
Don't be afraid.

325
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,330
Dorsa?

326
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:10,125
What are you doing?

327
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:12,497
Going to get kimia!

328
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:20,042
I think she's upstairs... they've taken
her upstairs... I want to go, find her...

329
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:23,383
Let's go back to bed.

330
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:53,787
- You need to eat something.
- I can't.

331
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:56,543
You have to eat
if you want to get better.

332
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:02,293
Do you know what I'm going
to do after breakfast?

333
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,133
I'll put a video on for you.

334
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,500
You can lie in front of the TV all
day and watch whatever you want.

335
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:13,882
But only if you eat breakfast.

336
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,922
- Dorsa?
- Yes?

337
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:36,168
- Have you seen my workout tape?
- No.

338
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:38,328
It was here but I can't find it now.

339
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:42,915
- I never touch the tapes.
- I didn't say you did.

340
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,575
Who is it?

341
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:53,535
Glazier.

342
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:02,457
Just a second...

343
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,415
- Hello.
- Hello.

344
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,670
Business must be good at the moment
with all the attacks.

345
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:25,958
Problem is, the missus insists
that it's too dangerous to stay.

346
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,670
- Wants us to move out of town...
- Mum.

347
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:32,708
I had my breakfast.
So, put the video on for me please.

348
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:38,210
- You said you would.
- Let's go outside and let the man work.

349
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:43,083
How many times have I told you not to
say we have a vcr, in front of a stranger?

350
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:45,035
Do you want the authorities
to find out and take it away?

351
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:49,083
But I'm bored...
I want kimia.

352
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,327
I told you I'll find kimia.

353
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:00,578
- Hello, shideh...
- Hello...

354
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,075
This is for you.

355
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:03,245
For what?

356
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:05,042
For your help yesterday.

357
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,133
I'm also here to say goodbye.

358
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:08,707
Goodbye?

359
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:12,540
I'm going back to Kurdistan for a while.
- But it's so dangerous over there.

360
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:16,793
My father always wanted
to be buried in his hometown.

361
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:20,542
Dorsa, my dear.

362
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:26,963
Remember, yesterday after the missile hit,
you said you saw something or someone?

363
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,380
Pargol?

364
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:31,917
- You said they were scary.
You were crying. - Pargol? Go inside.

365
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:37,582
Dorsa is a child.
She imagines things when she's scared...

366
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:40,125
You probably think I'm going crazy...

367
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:43,747
But my father was fine yesterday
after the missile hit.

368
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:46,582
He was talking to me. I swear.

369
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:51,035
I left the room to get him a glass
of water and then I heard him scream.

370
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,133
I ran back and saw...

371
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:55,417
He looked so terrified.

372
00:37:55,458 --> 00:38:01,038
His eyes were fixed on something
behind me I couldn't see.

373
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,133
Something terrifying...

374
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,537
Like...

375
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:11,915
I understand how hard it is to deal
with the death of someone so close.

376
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:15,788
You know I lost my
mother six months ago.

377
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:21,877
But it was the shock of the missile
that gave your father a heart attack.

378
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:48,077
- Is she still the same?
- Yeah.

379
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,915
The fever still won't break.

380
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:54,248
Maybe you should take her to a doctor...

381
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:57,502
I mean, like a pediatrician.

382
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,133
I can't stand any more of this,
ebrahimi.

383
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,877
You have to close up shop
and take us out of town.

384
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:09,627
If our tenants would
only pay what they owe

385
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:15,037
then I could close up shop.
Mrs. ebrahimi is right.

386
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:20,673
I've told fakur that we have to leave
everything and go to our son's in Paris.

387
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:26,458
We just renewed our visas, so I see
no reason to sit through this.

388
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:45,253
I missed you.

389
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,040
I'm here for dorsa.

390
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:53,075
I always knew you were useless.

391
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,710
- This can't be real.
- Why not?

392
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:19,378
Where did you go, ma'am?

393
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,077
Your tea is getting cold...
No, playtime is not over!

394
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:30,752
It was on the bed.

395
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:36,293
Nothing.

396
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:44,825
Nothing here either.

397
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:50,672
- Shideh, could you have dreamt it?
- It was too real.

398
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:31,672
What's my workout video
doing in the bin?

399
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,077
I'm talking to you.

400
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:46,628
Dorsa?

401
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,290
Dorsa...
What are you doing?

402
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:50,883
Where is she?

403
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:55,417
I want her back! Give her back!

404
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:09,503
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for kimia.

405
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,170
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

406
00:42:56,667 --> 00:43:01,287
Finally some peace.

407
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:06,673
Ebrahimi went out
and took the children with him.

408
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:12,582
So, how is little dorsa?

409
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:18,125
- She's a little under the weather.
- Oh, god.

410
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:21,707
Nothing serious, I hope?
No, just a cold I think.

411
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:26,040
Have you heard any strange noises
around the building recently?

412
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:29,463
If this is about dorsa's screams earlier
in the stairway

413
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,250
I apologize. She has been a bit restless
because of her fever.

414
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:35,752
Mehdi has been very restless too
but he doesn't seem to be ill.

415
00:43:35,792 --> 00:43:38,542
I knew he'd bring trouble with him.

416
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:41,133
Please don't say such things,
Mrs. ebrahimi.

417
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:43,077
I don't think you get it.

418
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:45,875
That thing didn't crash here by accident.

419
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:49,037
I think it brought something with it...

420
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:50,923
Like what?

421
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:53,378
Djinn.

422
00:43:53,417 --> 00:43:57,247
Djinn belong to fairy tales.

423
00:43:57,292 --> 00:43:59,632
This is not
a thousand and one nights.

424
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:00,747
You're wrong.

425
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:05,922
They travel on the wind from place to
place until they find someone to possess.

426
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:07,918
Why are you telling me this?

427
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:11,788
Why was dorsa outside bijari's
apartment, banging on the door?

428
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:15,463
I told you she's delirious
because of her high fever.

429
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,710
She was looking for someone.

430
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:22,000
Her favorite doll is missing. She thinks
it has somehow gone to the fourth floor.

431
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,543
I think I should go now...

432
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:30,293
You know, if they take a personal
belonging...

433
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:33,383
Something that you treasure...

434
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:35,917
Then there's no escape from them.

435
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:39,748
You'll be marked and they'll
always know how to find you.

436
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:44,875
Sorry, I'm late.
Mrs. ebrahimi accosted me.

437
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:56,038
- What time is your flight?
- Early morning.

438
00:44:57,125 --> 00:45:00,575
You must be excited to see your son.

439
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:03,745
The missile attacks have
actually been a good excuse.

440
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:09,212
He has missed us lots too.
Even wanted to come back.

441
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:12,790
I had to remind him that they'd
have him conscripted and sent

442
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:19,753
conscripted the front line
as soon as he landed!

443
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,830
What are you looking for?

444
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:28,035
I remember you had this book,
the people of the air, by saedi.

445
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:32,713
Yes, we have. Second shelf.
The contemporaries.

446
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:39,672
Do you know what it's about?

447
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:40,788
Djinn.

448
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:44,633
It's about superstitious
belief in djinn, down south...

449
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:48,133
And how they travel on the wind.

450
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:55,537
It's an anthropological book,
not a book to find answers in.

451
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,330
What answers?

452
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,127
I'm just saying

453
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:07,423
people can convince themselves
anything's real if they want to.

454
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:15,673
The winds refer to mysterious,
ethereal and magical forces

455
00:46:15,708 --> 00:46:19,248
which can be anywhere...

456
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:33,127
Where there is fear and anxiety,
the winds blow.

457
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

458
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

459
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,500
I'm glad I got hold of you.

460
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:34,962
I thought you'd have left the city
like everyone else.

461
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I sent the family away.

462
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:41,077
I'll join them during the weekend.

463
00:49:46,042 --> 00:49:49,422
- Have you heard from anyone recently?
- Not really.

464
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:53,998
I've been to the university a few times
and seen a few old faces.

465
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:56,672
Can you believe there are still people
from our time who haven't finished?

466
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:58,538
They're obviously not doctor material...

467
00:49:58,583 --> 00:50:01,713
- Did your own problem get sorted?
- No.

468
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,460
Take a deep breath, sweetheart.

469
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,455
I give her paracetamol
three times a day.

470
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,380
Also started with antibiotics when
i saw the fever wasn't breaking.

471
00:50:15,417 --> 00:50:17,667
There's no sign of internal infection.

472
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:19,458
So, why isn't her fever breaking?

473
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:24,417
Shideh, can I borrow you for a second?

474
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:27,785
Sit down, sweetheart.

475
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:36,207
Is everything okay at home?

476
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:38,578
Yes, why?

477
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,293
Everyone's under a lot of strain
right now.

478
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:47,293
Dorsa is no exception.
It could be stress related.

479
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:48,923
Everything's fine.

480
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:53,003
How about you?
Are you okay?

481
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,457
Yes.

482
00:50:57,292 --> 00:50:58,582
I'm fine.

483
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,330
What are you doing here on your own?

484
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,460
Do you need a lift?

485
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:28,998
Get in.

486
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:58,915
Where is her doll?

487
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:21,673
Where have you been, you little sod?

488
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:25,578
Hi, thanks for dropping him off.

489
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:29,325
- I saw him down the road...
- Do you want us to leave you behind?

490
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:33,745
- Is that what you want?
- Leave him alone. It's okay...

491
00:52:33,792 --> 00:52:35,962
How's little dorsa?

492
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,670
The same.
Are you leaving too?

493
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:43,078
What else can we do?
Take care of yourself. Goodbye.

494
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:45,538
Sorry...

495
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,330
Have a safe trip.

496
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:56,328
Please make sure you close the door
properly now that we are away.

497
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:20,455
- What are you doing?
- We are leaving too.

498
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,540
We can't.
What about kimia?

499
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,293
Okay. Try to remember
the last time you saw it.

500
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:29,535
It's not there now.
So, where else could it be?

501
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:32,923
- I don't know
- it didn't walk off on its own.

502
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:35,708
- Someone took her.
- Who? Who took it?

503
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:39,830
There's nobody here except for us.
Do you understand?

504
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:43,415
- Why are you shouting at me?
- Because I'm tired of this silly game.

505
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:45,918
If nobody took her,
where is she?

506
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:47,748
I didn't move her.

507
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,830
Just like you didn't
move my workout video, I suppose?

508
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:54,165
I said I didn't touch
your workout video!

509
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:56,078
How did it end up in the bin then?

510
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:59,998
The doll is around here somewhere.

511
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:03,328
It hasn't left the house
and nobody has taken it.

512
00:54:03,375 --> 00:54:06,535
If I didn't move her and nobody
took her, then where is she?

513
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:10,543
I suppose I took her then,
right?

514
00:54:32,667 --> 00:54:36,077
Please...
We can't leave kimia behind...

515
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:38,625
I'll be scared without her.

516
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:41,377
And I'll stay sick forever.

517
00:54:41,417 --> 00:54:43,917
Don't you want me to get better?

518
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:50,578
If you love me,
please help me find her...

519
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:05,750
Okay... but we'll leave
as soon as we find it.

520
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:36,250
You can sleep next to me
tonight, if you want.

521
00:56:41,417 --> 00:56:43,207
Maybe it's over.

522
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:49,168
Let's just stay a bit longer.

523
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:55,577
What's wrong?

524
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:05,125
Hi... do you know where she is?

525
00:58:05,167 --> 00:58:09,377
On top of where? The bookcase?

526
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:15,497
- Who are you talking to?
- That lady. She was standing right there.

527
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:42,832
What's this look?
Are we in Swiss now?

528
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:02,328
Here, cover yourself with this.
I'll go and speak to the haji.

529
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:05,205
What were you thinking? You know
your crime is punishable with lashes.

530
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:09,332
So, pray that he shows mercy.

531
00:59:29,417 --> 00:59:30,327
Stand up.

532
00:59:33,708 --> 00:59:36,708
Look, I'm letting you off
this time with a warning

533
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,670
only because Mrs. hashemi
has vouched for you.

534
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:41,248
Go and thank god that she did.

535
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:43,922
Because this behavior
is absolutely intolerable.

536
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:47,458
A woman should be scared of exposing
herself more than anything else.

537
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,130
So, be ashamed.

538
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:53,077
These are not the old times.
We have values now.

539
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:59,375
Our men are becoming martyrs
to protect these values...

540
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:21,208
What are you doing?

541
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:22,790
Nothing...

542
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:29,248
- Looking for kimia...
- Up there?

543
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:31,632
I thought maybe she was up there.

544
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:34,167
I told you I'd find it.

545
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,708
You really need to rest,
especially with your fever.

546
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,670
You hardly had any sleep last night.

547
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:53,127
Promise me that you'll find her.

548
01:02:53,167 --> 01:02:54,537
I promise.

549
01:02:57,125 --> 01:02:59,125
My dear...

550
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:10,457
Hello?

551
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,670
- Hello? Shideh?
- Hello? Hello?

552
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:16,378
- Why are you still there?
- Hi.

553
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:19,287
Please. Can you not be stubborn
about this under the circumstances?

554
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:21,293
I'm not being stubborn.

555
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:24,293
- Everyone's fleeing Tehran.
- But...

556
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:28,458
- But what? - Something has gone
missing. I have to find it first.

557
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,630
- What? - You wouldn't understand,
you haven't been here.

558
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:34,877
I'm just hearing excuses. I think its
best I get my parents to contact you...

559
01:03:34,917 --> 01:03:36,167
No...

560
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:38,708
....and officially invite you.

561
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:42,710
- Listen to me...
- I know you well enough. You're just a...

562
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:46,380
Hello?
You're cutting out... hello?

563
01:03:48,917 --> 01:03:50,627
Who is it?

564
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

565
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

566
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:22,668
Dorsa!
Dorsa, open the door!

567
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:33,253
Where were you?

568
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,575
Did you see anyone?

569
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:40,665
Who?

570
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:42,825
I don't know... like a lady?

571
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,790
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

572
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:49,173
She comes when you're not around.

573
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:52,713
What does she do?

574
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:56,460
She plays with me. She's nice.

575
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,330
What does she want?

576
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:00,788
She says...

577
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,750
You can't look after me but she can.

578
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:07,793
That's nonsense.

579
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:11,793
She says she knows where kimia is.
She can help me find her...

580
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:18,167
This is all in your head.
She's not real.

581
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:23,462
But you said you saw her too.

582
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:35,460
To the last person, to the last home

583
01:05:36,292 --> 01:05:38,922
and to the last drop of blood

584
01:05:38,958 --> 01:05:44,538
we are standing
in exaltation at the word, god.

585
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:20,457
- Mum, can I go back to bed?
- No.

586
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,040
You've to stay where I can see you.

587
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:24,133
On the sofa?

588
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:29,127
Didn't we agree not to come in here
anymore? The room is off limits.

589
01:06:30,042 --> 01:06:36,462
- If I can't be there, then why are you?
- Because I'm looking for your doll.

590
01:06:38,417 --> 01:06:40,917
The lady was right.

591
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:45,418
What did you say?
I'm sick of this nonsense!

592
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:49,748
I don't want to hear about this lady
anymore, whether she's real or not!

593
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:51,462
Understand?

594
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,420
I'll run off with her then!

595
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:08,245
Stop it!

596
01:07:09,042 --> 01:07:11,382
Stop!

597
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Please... have me instead...
Please...

598
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,957
Dorsa?

599
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:02,037
Dorsa?

600
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:09,745
I woke up and you weren't here.

601
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:15,878
- I heard noises.
- What noises?

602
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,043
Hello?

603
01:09:57,667 --> 01:10:01,417
Shideh, have you found what
you were looking for yet?

604
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:03,328
Hello, iraj.

605
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:05,495
You might find this hard to believe,
but...

606
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:12,537
But I really think there
is something haunting us.

607
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:16,333
They've taken dorsa's doll and...
I have to find it...

608
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:19,875
If I don't, they'll never leave dorsa
alone...

609
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:23,325
But you can't protect dorsa.

610
01:10:24,667 --> 01:10:30,577
You're useless!
You're nothing but a disappointment!

611
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:32,915
Even your daughter hates you!

612
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:36,038
- Shut up!
- No, you shut up, whore!

613
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:38,543
You brought this on yourself!

614
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:46,173
Go away!

615
01:10:49,292 --> 01:10:50,882
What is that?

616
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:25,793
Your loving mother...

617
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:42,748
Why did you do that?

618
01:11:44,042 --> 01:11:47,002
You killed her!
You killed her!

619
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:51,923
- I didn't do it.
- Liar!

620
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:54,328
They did it.
The ones you talk about.

621
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:57,075
That's your drawer!
You hide your things in it!

622
01:11:57,125 --> 01:12:01,285
That's why they put it in here.
They want you to think that I did it.

623
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:06,878
But you said they're not real.

624
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:12,915
Okay. The important
thing is we found her.

625
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:14,918
But she's dead!

626
01:12:15,792 --> 01:12:18,632
- I'll fix her.
- How?

627
01:12:22,417 --> 01:12:25,287
Lie on the bed and close your eyes.

628
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:28,043
It'll be fixed when you open them.

629
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:31,382
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

630
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:04,540
Dorsa.

631
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,920
Dorsa.

632
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:09,417
Dorsa.

633
01:13:22,458 --> 01:13:24,578
Look!

634
01:13:27,292 --> 01:13:28,962
Your fever has gone.

635
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:34,328
You know I love you, right?

636
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:36,333
Right?

637
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,748
We'll be downstairs
until the danger is over

638
01:13:52,792 --> 01:13:54,582
and then we'll leave
and go to granny's.

639
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:56,665
I don't want to stay here anymore.

640
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:58,828
Wear your coat.

641
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:02,205
It's not here.
Maybe it's in your room.

642
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:04,290
Let's go. I'm right behind you.

643
01:14:12,042 --> 01:14:13,542
I'm right here!

644
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:17,382
I'm right here!

645
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:20,247
Wait for me.

646
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:37,043
Why aren't you coming?

647
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:39,288
Did you hear something?

648
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:53,785
Mum! Mum! Mum!

649
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:56,923
Please, mum...

650
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:59,748
Help me, mum!

651
01:15:00,625 --> 01:15:02,785
Please!

652
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:05,133
It sounds like you.

653
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:12,290
- Dorsa!
- Don't go!

654
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:14,543
Dorsa!

655
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:16,503
Dorsa, I'm coming!

656
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:18,042
Dorsa!

657
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,747
Dorsa!

658
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:23,172
Dorsa!
Mummy's coming!

659
01:15:24,167 --> 01:15:27,377
I'm coming!
I'm coming!

660
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,130
- Mummy!
- Leave her alone!

661
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,580
Dorsa!

662
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:40,705
Mummy!

663
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:42,460
Mummy!

664
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,290
- Mummy!
- Dorsa?

665
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:46,673
- Dorsa?
- Mummy!

666
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:50,248
- I'm here, sweetheart.
- Mummy!

667
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Mummy... it has got me!
- I've got you!

668
01:16:27,167 --> 01:16:30,037
- Dorsa?
- Don't come close.

669
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:32,173
Why did you leave me again?

670
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:35,245
I made a mistake.

671
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:39,422
- What?
- Whom are you talking to?

672
01:16:39,458 --> 01:16:42,498
The lady...
She says you took kimia!

673
01:16:42,542 --> 01:16:44,752
- Me?
- She says you were hiding it!

674
01:16:44,792 --> 01:16:48,752
- No. She's lying.
- You're lying. You took it.

675
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:53,082
- Don't lie.
- Yes. Maybe.

676
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:55,875
I'm not sure.
I really don't know...

677
01:16:55,917 --> 01:16:59,247
But I know I love you very much.
I'm telling you the truth.

678
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:04,167
If I've upset you in any way,
I'm sorry.

679
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:06,498
I didn't mean to.
Please forgive me.

680
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
I know you're scared.
I am too. Come over here.
Let's leave, then we won't be afraid...
Come here, sweetheart.

681
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,460
Mum!

682
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,380
Mum, please help me!

683
01:17:18,417 --> 01:17:19,787
Mum!

684
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:23,083
Mum, please help me!

685
01:17:35,708 --> 01:17:37,918
Mum!

686
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:43,035
Dorsa!

687
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:45,633
- Mum!
- Dorsa!

688
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:49,457
Mum, please help me...

689
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,213
Don't leave me...

690
01:17:58,458 --> 01:18:01,578
Don't leave me!

691
01:18:03,417 --> 01:18:04,917
Oh, my god!

692
01:18:05,542 --> 01:18:07,422
Are you okay, my dear?

693
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:15,455
Go! I'll come too. Hurry up.

694
01:18:24,292 --> 01:18:27,292
No. Don't come to me.
Don't step on the ground.

695
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:28,883
Go up.

696
01:18:55,083 --> 01:18:56,463
Run...

697
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,750
Run!

698
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,580
Kimia!

699
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,250
Hurry up...

700
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:15,003
Get in.

701
01:19:30,042 --> 01:19:32,132
Shit!

702
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:44,917
Mum...
What is wrong?

703
01:19:44,958 --> 01:19:46,328
Mum...

704
01:19:47,042 --> 01:19:49,752
- Mum?
- Come to the front.
