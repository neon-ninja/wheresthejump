1
00:01:30,937 --> 00:01:33,007
Help!
Someone help me!

2
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:38,971
Is someone there?

3
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:46,619
Oh, shit. I'm probably dead.

4
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:48,881
<i>- You're not dead.</i>
- Who's that?

5
00:01:54,294 --> 00:01:56,057
Turn on the lights!

6
00:01:56,997 --> 00:01:58,464
Wish I could.

7
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:01,727
What the fuck is going on? Where am I?

8
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:03,926
I don't know yet.

9
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:05,733
What is that smell?

10
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:10,200
I don't see a thing, asshole.

11
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:56,448
Shit!

12
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,937
Help!

13
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,516
No one can hear you.

14
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:31,947
- What the fuck is this?
- Calm down. Just calm down.

15
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,153
- Are you hurt?
- I don't know. Yeah!

16
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:40,323
What's your name?

17
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,769
My name is very fucking confused.
What's your name? What's going on here?

18
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:47,466
My name is Lawrence Gordon. I'm a doctor.

19
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,066
I just woke up here. Just like you.

20
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:05,123
- Recognize that man?
- No.

21
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:11,863
- Do you have any idea how you got here?
- No.

22
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:15,197
- What's the last thing you remember?
- Nothing.

23
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:19,864
I went to bed in my shit-hole apartment
and woke up in an actual shit-hole.

24
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:24,534
What about you?

25
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,612
There's not much to tell really.

26
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:34,381
I was on my way home from work
and I don't remember anything else.

27
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:44,593
First dead body I've ever seen.
Look different in real life.

28
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,560
They don't move.

29
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:56,241
From the looks of these chains...

30
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:59,244
someone didn't want us
to go very far either.

31
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:02,946
- Can you see any scars?
- What?

32
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:05,776
This is what they do.
They kidnap you and drug you...

33
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:07,000
and before you know it,

34
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:09,447
you're in a bathtub and
your kidneys are on eBay.

35
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:13,424
- No one has taken your kidneys.
- How can you tell from way over there?

36
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:18,055
Because you'd either be in terrible agony
or you'd be dead by now.

37
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:19,256
Trust me.

38
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:21,630
- What are you, a surgeon?
- Yeah.

39
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:29,375
So, you going to tell
me your name or what?

40
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:35,039
Adam.

41
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:37,513
Well, Adam...

42
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:41,515
what we need to do...

43
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:45,356
is start thinking about why we are here.

44
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:48,553
Whoever brought us here
could've killed us by now.

45
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:50,220
But they didn't.

46
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,064
They must want something from us.

47
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:56,533
Question is what.

48
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:04,369
- That clock.
- What about it?

49
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:07,545
- It's brand-new.
- So?

50
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:12,847
So somebody obviously
wanted us to know the time.

51
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:18,582
Wait. I think I might be able
to reach the door.

52
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:45,984
What is that?

53
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:50,520
Excuse me.

54
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,018
- It's a tape.
- Where did you find it?

55
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:56,024
It was in my pocket.

56
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:05,765
It says "Play me."

57
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:39,333
Come on.

58
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:43,670
Throw it over here.

59
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,454
No?

60
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:34,724
- Use your shirt.
- What?

61
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:36,459
Your shirt.

62
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:53,507
Come on.

63
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:59,246
It won't work.

64
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:02,447
Look around.
There must be something else you can use.

65
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:05,355
- There's nothing.
- There must be something.

66
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:21,104
Come on. You can do it.

67
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:27,810
Come on. Again.

68
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:53,282
<i>Rise and shine, Adam.</i>

69
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:55,763
<i>You're probably
wondering where you are.</i>

70
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:58,542
<i>I'll tell you where you might be.</i>

71
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:01,543
<i>You might be in the
room that you die in.</i>

72
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:05,045
<i>Up until now,</i>
<i>you simply sat in the shadows...</i>

73
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:07,586
<i>watching others live
out their lives.</i>

74
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,654
<i>What do voyeurs see</i>
<i>when they look into the mirror?</i>

75
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:14,751
<i>Now, I see you as a strange mix...</i>

76
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:18,024
<i>of someone angry
and yet apathetic.</i>

77
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:20,458
<i>But mostly just pathetic.</i>

78
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:23,827
<i>So are you going to watch yourself</i>
<i>die today, Adam?</i>

79
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:26,167
<i>Or do something about it?</i>

80
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,530
I don't get it.

81
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:31,972
Throw me the player.

82
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:36,172
No. You throw me your tape.

83
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:39,489
Look, we're going to
have to work together

84
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,910
if we want to get out of here.

85
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:42,420
Now, just throw it to me.

86
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:46,151
I'm not going to risk breaking it.
You throw me your tape.

87
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:06,605
<i>Dr. Gordon.
This is your wake-up call.</i>

88
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:11,281
<i>Every day of your working life,</i>
<i>you have given people the news...</i>

89
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:13,683
<i>that they are going to die soon.</i>

90
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:16,980
<i>Now you will be
the cause of death.</i>

91
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:20,685
<i>Your aim in this
game is to kill Adam.</i>

92
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:24,060
<i>You have until 6:00
on the clock to do it.</i>

93
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:27,890
<i>There's a man in
the room with you.</i>

94
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:30,759
<i>When there is that much
poison in your blood, </i>

95
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,495
<i>the only thing left to do...</i>

96
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:34,333
<i>is shoot yourself.</i>

97
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,274
<i>There are ways to win this...</i>

98
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:44,546
<i>hidden all around you.</i>

99
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:46,114
<i>Just remember:</i>

100
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:49,179
<i>"X" marks the spot
for the treasure.</i>

101
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,984
<i>If you do not kill Adam by 6:00...</i>

102
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:57,454
<i>then Alison and Diana will die,
Dr. Gordon.</i>

103
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:03,502
<i>And I'll leave you
in this room to rot.</i>

104
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:05,266
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

105
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:18,177
Give me that. Now.

106
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:31,161
<i>... then Alison and Diana will die,</i>
<i>Dr. Gordon.</i>

107
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:34,767
<i>And I will leave you
in this room to rot.</i>

108
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:37,062
Any idea who that is?

109
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:38,899
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

110
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:43,004
- He knows us.
- Come on.

111
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:45,270
What do you think?

112
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:47,745
Probably a joke, right?

113
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:50,347
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

114
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,610
Listen.

115
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:54,913
<i>Follow your heart.</i>

116
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:05,629
What the hell does
"follow your heart" mean?

117
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:14,301
There, right next to you, on the toilet.

118
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:25,979
Come on.

119
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,601
- Anything?
- No solids.

120
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:44,929
Take off the lid.

121
00:13:59,452 --> 00:14:02,353
I really wish I had
checked in there first.

122
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:04,621
What is it?

123
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:37,785
Mind passing me the other one?

124
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:04,909
Fuck!

125
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:52,297
He doesn't want us
to cut through our chains.

126
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,893
He wants us to cut through our feet.

127
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:02,430
I think I may know who's done this to us.

128
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:06,000
- What did you say?
- It's not someone I know personally.

129
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,841
It's just someone I know of.

130
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:12,817
Jesus Christ! Tell me. Who is it?

131
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:16,984
The last I heard...

132
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:20,754
the police still hadn't caught him.

133
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,991
<i>And the only reason I know that</i>
<i>is because I was a suspect.</i>

134
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,230
<i>I'll start from the beginning.</i>

135
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,068
This one's not fresh anymore.
At least three weeks out.

136
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:44,412
Victim's a 46-year-old male.

137
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:50,653
Died of massive blood loss.
Mostly through the femoral artery.

138
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:55,988
He started at the back of the cage...

139
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:58,530
and tunneled his way
through that razor wire so fast...

140
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:01,191
it's amazing he got as far as he did.

141
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:06,428
Cut himself so deep, we found
traces of stomach acid on the floor.

142
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:10,503
We also found this.

143
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:15,278
<i>Hello, Paul.</i>

144
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:19,383
<i>You're a perfectly healthy, sane,</i>
<i>middle-class male.</i>

145
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:23,886
<i>Yet, last month, you ran a straight
razor across your wrists.</i>

146
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:28,322
<i>Did you hurt yourself</i>
<i>because you truly wanted to die...</i>

147
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:30,919
<i>or did you just
want some attention?</i>

148
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,421
<i>Tonight, you'll show me.</i>

149
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:36,172
<i>The irony is that
if you want to die</i>

150
00:17:36,173 --> 00:17:38,500
<i>you just have to
stay where you are.</i>

151
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:42,401
<i>But if you want to live,</i>
<i>you'll have to cut yourself again.</i>

152
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:45,600
<i>One path through the
razor wire to the door.</i>

153
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:49,708
<i>But hurry.
At 3:00 that door will lock...</i>

154
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:53,178
<i>and then this room
becomes your tomb.</i>

155
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,750
<i>How much blood will you shed</i>
<i>to stay alive, Paul?</i>

156
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:04,125
The door was on a timer.
It was unlocked until 3:00.

157
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Then it snapped shut.
He was given two hours.

158
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:17,108
Jigsaw piece.

159
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:24,447
I think I'm gonna be here for a while.

160
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:27,953
The newspapers started calling him
the "Jigsaw killer."

161
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:31,147
Actually, technically speaking, he is...

162
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:34,590
not really a murderer.

163
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:38,091
He never killed anyone.

164
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:41,258
<i>He finds ways for his victims</i>
<i>to kill themselves.</i>

165
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:45,869
<i>Hello, Mark, if you're so sick...</i>

166
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:49,563
<i>then why do I have so many
photos of you up and about?</i>

167
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:53,577
<i>Let's put your so-called
illness to the test.</i>

168
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,107
<i>Right now, there is a slow-acting
poison in your veins.</i>

169
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:01,550
<i>The antidote is inside the safe.</i>

170
00:19:03,122 --> 00:19:05,283
<i>The combination to the safe...</i>

171
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:08,092
<i>is written on the wall.</i>

172
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:11,759
<i>Hurry up and program it in.</i>
<i>But watch your step.</i>

173
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:16,863
<i>By the way, that's flammable substance
smeared on your body.</i>

174
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:20,700
<i>So I would be careful with
that candle, if I were you...</i>

175
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:21,797
Help.

176
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:24,240
<i>... or all the people</i>
<i>you've burned with your act...</i>

177
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,244
<i>just might have their revenge.</i>

178
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,519
I found something else.
Well, two things actually.

179
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,748
There was someone standing outside here
watching through this peephole.

180
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:44,267
Looks like our friend
Jigsaw likes to book

181
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,594
himself front row
seats to his sick games.

182
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:49,526
He was there at the last one as well.

183
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:53,464
Only this time, he left us his penlight.

184
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,979
- Get a rush on the prints.
- Copy that.

185
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:06,848
Okay. This patient has an inoperable
frontal lobe tumor...

186
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:10,446
extending across the midline.
Started as a colon cancer.

187
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:14,219
The patient has come in
for a standard checkup...

188
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:18,491
by which we are able to monitor the rate
at which his condition is declining.

189
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:22,862
- The patient had...
- His name is John, Dr. Gordon.

190
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:26,401
He's a very interesting person.

191
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,301
Thank you for that information, Zep.

192
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:34,608
As you can see, our orderlies form
very special bonds with the patients.

193
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:37,132
Continuing on, the patient...

194
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:39,976
<i>Dr. Gordon, please page the operator.</i>

195
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:44,099
Obviously, someone doesn't want me

196
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,788
to tell you what the patient has.
Excuse me.

197
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,563
Dr. Gordon, I'm Det. Tapp...

198
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:57,227
this is Det. Sing. City Homicide.

199
00:20:57,303 --> 00:20:58,930
Very impressive.

200
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:02,740
Thank you. I do my best.

201
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:08,227
Sorry to interrupt
you while you're working.

202
00:21:08,228 --> 00:21:09,043
That's fine.

203
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:11,082
How can I help you, gentlemen?

204
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,118
Tell us where you were...

205
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:17,178
between the hours of 11:00 p.m.
and 1:00 a.m. last night, Doctor.

206
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,815
Why is it that you're interested?

207
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:22,861
We'd like to ask you
a few questions about it.

208
00:21:23,062 --> 00:21:26,998
For your sake, I think it's best
if we do it down at the station.

209
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:28,966
Would you like to follow us there?

210
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:31,935
No. I'm afraid
that's quite out of the question.

211
00:21:32,004 --> 00:21:35,997
I can't just leave, I have work to do.
Plus, my wife has the car today.

212
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:39,053
That's okay. You can ride with us, Doc.

213
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,594
I'm sorry, you'll have to tell me again.
What is this all about?

214
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,566
Is this yours, Doctor?

215
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,541
So you have no idea how your penlight
showed up at the murder scene?

216
00:22:09,617 --> 00:22:11,141
Of course not.

217
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:17,683
I'll have to ask.
What were you doing last night?

218
00:22:21,129 --> 00:22:22,619
I was seeing someone.

219
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:25,661
Who?

220
00:22:30,471 --> 00:22:32,631
Look, if you can't
be honest with me...

221
00:22:32,632 --> 00:22:35,170
I was visiting someone.
It wasn't a patient.

222
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,713
What am I gonna do?

223
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:45,549
Well, as your lawyer and your friend,
my advice to you is to bite the bullet...

224
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,815
and give them your alibi now.

225
00:22:48,623 --> 00:22:51,592
Because no one is going to
believe you later.

226
00:22:56,231 --> 00:22:58,222
That was five months ago.

227
00:23:01,836 --> 00:23:04,168
He tried to set me up for murder.

228
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:12,246
Okay. We checked your alibi. It holds up.

229
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:15,379
Good. Can I go home now?

230
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:19,345
We have one of the victims
who managed to escape.

231
00:23:19,687 --> 00:23:22,396
Want to know if you
wouldn't mind sticking around

232
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:24,021
and listening to her testimony?

233
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:27,556
- Maybe it'll trigger something.
- I'd like to help really but...

234
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:29,654
We'd really appreciate it.

235
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:33,127
- She's the only one who made it.
- Okay.

236
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:40,168
Amanda...

237
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:43,372
in your own time...

238
00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:46,739
tell me the first thing you remember.

239
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:05,859
<i>I woke up.
All I could taste was blood...</i>

240
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:08,767
<i>and metal.</i>

241
00:24:37,832 --> 00:24:39,322
<i>Hello, Amanda.</i>

242
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:43,268
<i>You don't know me, but I know you.</i>

243
00:24:44,072 --> 00:24:48,065
<i>I want to play a game.</i>
<i>Here's what happens if you lose.</i>

244
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:53,710
<i>The device you're wearing is hooked
into your upper and lower jaws.</i>

245
00:24:54,349 --> 00:24:56,783
<i>When the timer at
the back goes off...</i>

246
00:24:56,851 --> 00:24:59,945
<i>your mouth will be</i>
<i>permanently ripped open.</i>

247
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:03,257
<i>Think of it like a
reverse bear trap.</i>

248
00:25:04,025 --> 00:25:05,754
<i>Here, I'll show you.</i>

249
00:25:18,706 --> 00:25:21,504
<i>There is only one key
to open the device.</i>

250
00:25:22,443 --> 00:25:25,310
<i>It's in the stomach
of your dead cellmate.</i>

251
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:29,882
<i>Look around, Amanda.</i>
<i>Know that I'm not lying.</i>

252
00:25:30,852 --> 00:25:32,717
<i>You better hurry up.</i>

253
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:36,486
<i>Live or die. Make your choice.</i>

254
00:26:15,196 --> 00:26:17,096
And then I saw the body.

255
00:26:40,788 --> 00:26:42,312
There was a knife.

256
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:16,856
He'd been injected
with an opiate overdose.

257
00:27:18,025 --> 00:27:20,858
He couldn't move or
feel much of anything.

258
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:26,263
- You mean he was alive?
- Was.

259
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:31,328
What happened after you took it off?

260
00:28:28,516 --> 00:28:31,349
<i>Congratulations.
You are still alive.</i>

261
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:36,348
<i>Most people are so
ungrateful to be alive.</i>

262
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,651
<i>But not you. Not anymore.</i>

263
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:50,595
You are, in fact, a drug addict.
Isn't that right, Mandy?

264
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:55,937
Do you think that is why he picked you?

265
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,551
Are you grateful, Mandy?

266
00:29:09,857 --> 00:29:12,826
He helped me.

267
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:55,560
- Are you sure it's him?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

268
00:29:56,537 --> 00:29:58,752
How do I know you're
telling the truth?

269
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:01,133
You can be the one that
put me in this room.

270
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:04,963
I'm in exactly the
same situation you are in.

271
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:05,678
Wrong.

272
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:10,022
You've got one thing
I don't: information.

273
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:11,246
You know who did this.

274
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:15,414
Now you either tell me
what is really going on...

275
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:18,822
or I'll cut you with this. You hear me?
I'll cut...

276
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,561
- What?
- It's a two-way mirror.

277
00:30:57,198 --> 00:30:58,825
I can see you.

278
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:03,260
<i>So that's what this is.
Reality TV.</i>

279
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:06,772
Don't look at me. I can't help you.

280
00:31:06,874 --> 00:31:10,071
Can you hear me in there?
I'm having a blast.

281
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:13,271
This is the most fun I've had
without lubricant.

282
00:31:13,614 --> 00:31:16,139
Make sure you're getting everything.

283
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,786
That's not going to do anything.

284
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,957
<i>You just want to leave it running on us?</i>

285
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:26,248
<i>He won't stop it.</i>

286
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:28,485
That's why we can't cut
through these chains.

287
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:30,553
It's why you won't break that glass.

288
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:33,691
Every possible angle
has been pre-thought out by him.

289
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:36,362
You sound like you admire this prick.

290
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:37,975
To overcome something,

291
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:40,534
you have to understand
what a perfect engine it is.

292
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,838
That's how you fight disease.

293
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,072
Now the tape told us to find an "X."

294
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:48,964
That "X" has to be
somewhere in this room.

295
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:49,947
Help me find it.

296
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:53,809
How can you be the calm doctor-guy
when your wife and kid are out there?

297
00:31:53,888 --> 00:31:57,051
He's got them, too. He could be doing
anything to them right now.

298
00:31:57,124 --> 00:32:00,821
- Are you thinking about that?
- I am thinking about that.

299
00:32:07,101 --> 00:32:10,935
I've been thinking about the
last thing I said to my daughter.

300
00:33:54,308 --> 00:33:56,401
Diana. Honey, are you okay?

301
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:01,373
- Can you hear me?
- Mommy.

302
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:05,777
- What is it, sweetpea?
- There's a man in my room.

303
00:34:06,887 --> 00:34:10,448
Honey, are you sure
he's not just hiding in your imagination?

304
00:34:10,524 --> 00:34:12,151
He talked to me.

305
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:17,963
- Okay, I'll come and check your room.
- I want Daddy.

306
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,590
He'll get the scary man.

307
00:34:22,036 --> 00:34:24,470
All right, if you want. Come on.

308
00:34:27,808 --> 00:34:32,040
Larry, sorry to bother you,
but your daughter had a bad dream again.

309
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:33,603
Just a minute.

310
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:36,980
She wants you to check her room.

311
00:34:38,152 --> 00:34:40,620
Just got to finish this paragraph.

312
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:46,422
Come on, sweetie, I'll go check with you.

313
00:34:48,729 --> 00:34:50,253
Yep. I'm done.

314
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,367
See, there's no one in your room.

315
00:34:56,737 --> 00:35:01,037
There's no such thing as the bad man.
Now can you go to sleep?

316
00:35:01,842 --> 00:35:03,935
- I'm still scared.
- You are?

317
00:35:04,111 --> 00:35:05,738
Give me your tootsy.

318
00:35:08,382 --> 00:35:10,373
What a big tootsy.

319
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:12,646
Remember this one?

320
00:35:13,354 --> 00:35:16,915
"This little piggy went to market
This little piggy stayed home

321
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:21,360
"This little piggy had roast beef
This little piggy had none

322
00:35:21,896 --> 00:35:26,162
"This little piggy went 'Whee'
all the way home"

323
00:35:30,237 --> 00:35:31,932
I hate that thing.

324
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,574
I have to go to work, sweetheart.
You know what Daddy's job is like.

325
00:35:36,644 --> 00:35:38,111
Now, come on.

326
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:43,806
Let's see.
Try and get some sleep now, okay?

327
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:53,960
You're not going to leave us,
are you, Daddy?

328
00:35:55,663 --> 00:35:56,652
What?

329
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:03,799
What are you talking about?
You mean, leave you and Mommy?

330
00:36:06,307 --> 00:36:10,437
No, sweetheart. I would never do that.

331
00:36:11,512 --> 00:36:14,777
- Who gave you that idea?
- No one.

332
00:36:16,116 --> 00:36:18,346
It's not true. Okay?

333
00:36:20,955 --> 00:36:22,946
How much do I love you?

334
00:36:23,023 --> 00:36:25,787
- Love you very much.
- Very much. That's right.

335
00:36:27,027 --> 00:36:29,757
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Daddy.

336
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:38,000
Tomorrow, I'll read
your favorite story.

337
00:36:38,001 --> 00:36:38,637
Okay.

338
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:42,002
I don't know how much
longer I can do this.

339
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:43,202
What are you talking about?

340
00:36:43,277 --> 00:36:45,745
How can you walk through life
pretending you're happy?

341
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:48,441
- I am happy.
- That is complete bullshit.

342
00:36:48,515 --> 00:36:51,382
I'd rather you break down
and tell me that you hated me.

343
00:36:51,452 --> 00:36:54,114
At least there'd be some passion in it.

344
00:36:58,826 --> 00:37:00,851
Would you like to see her?

345
00:37:17,378 --> 00:37:19,972
- She's beautiful.
- Thank you.

346
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:26,209
- You gonna have any more kids?
- We've talked about it, but...

347
00:37:28,188 --> 00:37:32,648
with our schedules, it's difficult enough
to concentrate on one.

348
00:37:34,495 --> 00:37:36,793
So where is the lucky wife?

349
00:37:37,898 --> 00:37:40,628
There's another picture
behind the one you're looking at.

350
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:44,797
It's my favorite one
because we're all in it together.

351
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:48,338
Someone, usually me,
has to hold the camera...

352
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:51,469
which means I'm always missing
from the photos.

353
00:38:09,463 --> 00:38:12,489
- It's not here.
- What?

354
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:16,068
This photo you're
talking about is not here.

355
00:38:16,437 --> 00:38:19,065
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

356
00:38:34,988 --> 00:38:36,580
He must have taken it.

357
00:38:36,657 --> 00:38:39,353
How can you walk through life
pretending you're happy?

358
00:38:39,426 --> 00:38:42,486
- I am happy.
- That is complete bullshit.

359
00:38:42,563 --> 00:38:45,157
I'd rather you break down
and tell me that you hated me.

360
00:38:45,232 --> 00:38:47,962
At least there'd be some passion in it.

361
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:53,596
We can talk about this later, okay?

362
00:38:56,577 --> 00:38:57,942
Just leave.

363
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>Good night, little girl.</i>

364
00:39:42,723 --> 00:39:43,883
Diana!

365
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,434
Mommy!

366
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:12,408
Mommy!

367
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:29,731
Don't do that! Leave her!

368
00:41:27,794 --> 00:41:29,523
<i>You little man...</i>

369
00:41:30,564 --> 00:41:32,031
<i>I see you.</i>

370
00:41:35,836 --> 00:41:39,499
<i>Does Dr. Gordon know</i>
<i>you're at home with his wife?</i>

371
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,142
<i>I know you know something.</i>

372
00:41:49,616 --> 00:41:51,641
<i>What are you doing there?</i>

373
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:56,722
<i>Waiting for the doctor?</i>
<i>I'm waiting for the doctor, too.</i>

374
00:42:08,502 --> 00:42:11,198
<i>I know that she'll let you go.</i>

375
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:40,944
<i>So you have no idea
how your penlight</i>

376
00:42:40,945 --> 00:42:42,527
<i>showed up at the
murder scene?</i>

377
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:44,195
We checked your alibi. It holds up.

378
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:45,397
Isn't that right?

379
00:42:45,472 --> 00:42:47,838
<i>I know that she'll let you go.</i>

380
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,613
Here we are.

381
00:42:55,882 --> 00:43:00,216
That was quite an amazing story
that poor woman told.

382
00:43:19,106 --> 00:43:22,633
I'm sorry I can't be of more help
to your investigation.

383
00:43:23,677 --> 00:43:26,703
You know,
we arrested a dentist last week...

384
00:43:27,014 --> 00:43:29,915
who liked to play with
kids a bit too much.

385
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,814
He lived two blocks from here.

386
00:43:33,353 --> 00:43:37,949
The sewer lines
run under this neighborhood, too, Doctor.

387
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:04,073
<i>Hello, Amanda.</i>

388
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:08,078
<i>You don't know me, but I know you.</i>

389
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:12,552
<i>I want to play a game.</i>
<i>Here's what happens if you lose.</i>

390
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:19,230
<i>There's a timer at the back
of the device you're wearing.</i>

391
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:21,028
<i>When the timer goes off...</i>

392
00:44:21,401 --> 00:44:24,393
<i>your mouth will be</i>
<i>permanently ripped open.</i>

393
00:44:25,238 --> 00:44:26,569
I'll catch you guys down there.

394
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,040
<i>Think of it like a
reverse bear trap.</i>

395
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:36,182
<i>I'll show you.</i>

396
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:46,322
We're gonna go down to The Grill,
go get a beer. You wanna come?

397
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:49,954
- I don't think so. Thanks, anyway.
- You know I always ask.

398
00:44:50,263 --> 00:44:51,696
<i>There's only one key...</i>

399
00:44:51,765 --> 00:44:54,029
I'll leave you to have fun here then.

400
00:44:54,134 --> 00:44:56,796
<i>It's in the stomach
of your dead cellmate.</i>

401
00:44:57,971 --> 00:45:00,701
I don't mean for this
to be disrespectful.

402
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:05,377
Maybe you should find
yourself a girlfriend.

403
00:45:08,515 --> 00:45:11,348
<i>It's in the stomach
of your dead cellmate.</i>

404
00:45:11,518 --> 00:45:12,951
<i>Look around.</i>

405
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:17,989
<i>Look around, Amanda.</i>
<i>Know that I'm not lying.</i>

406
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,122
<i>You better hurry up.</i>

407
00:45:23,964 --> 00:45:25,454
Wait! Sing.

408
00:45:27,834 --> 00:45:29,859
- Get back here.
- What?

409
00:45:43,817 --> 00:45:45,614
Remember 118th Street?

410
00:45:49,022 --> 00:45:50,421
K2K.

411
00:45:50,891 --> 00:45:53,485
That gang's territory
was only about four blocks.

412
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,084
Listen to this.

413
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:09,873
We gotta check the records...

414
00:46:09,943 --> 00:46:11,123
from all fire emergencies

415
00:46:11,124 --> 00:46:13,106
that occurred there
in the last two weeks.

416
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,704
Go. Right now.

417
00:46:15,215 --> 00:46:17,115
On the night of Tuesday, the 17th...

418
00:46:17,184 --> 00:46:21,678
we got a fire alarm going off
in the rear wing of 213, Stygian Street.

419
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:25,254
It's an old listing.
Used to be a mannequin factory.

420
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:27,991
Think we have enough for a warrant now?

421
00:46:28,061 --> 00:46:30,188
Who said anything about a warrant?

422
00:46:30,764 --> 00:46:32,425
- Right now?
- Why not?

423
00:46:44,911 --> 00:46:47,607
At least we'll have
the cover of darkness.

424
00:46:48,148 --> 00:46:50,514
Yeah, well, so will anybody else.

425
00:47:36,496 --> 00:47:37,963
I got you.

426
00:48:30,483 --> 00:48:32,383
What the hell is this?

427
00:48:49,402 --> 00:48:50,391
Shit!

428
00:49:18,631 --> 00:49:19,791
- Sing.
- What?

429
00:49:19,866 --> 00:49:22,096
- Let's see what's he's gonna do.
- Why? We got him.

430
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:25,035
We don't know what he looks like.
Lets see what he's gonna do.

431
00:49:25,105 --> 00:49:26,629
No fucking way.

432
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,065
Fuck that. I'm gonna take him.

433
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:31,372
What the fuck? Shit!

434
00:50:18,091 --> 00:50:19,820
Awake already, Jeff?

435
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:24,561
I need more powerful tranquilizers
next time. Don't cry.

436
00:50:25,131 --> 00:50:27,395
I've given your life a purpose.

437
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:30,761
You're a test subject
for something greater than yourself.

438
00:50:30,837 --> 00:50:33,169
- Freeze! Police.
- Hold it right there! Don't move!

439
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,673
Put your fucking hands in the air!

440
00:50:42,649 --> 00:50:44,116
Now you'll make a choice.

441
00:50:44,184 --> 00:50:46,982
In 20 seconds,
the life of this man will be ended.

442
00:50:47,053 --> 00:50:49,544
- Shut up and get down here.
- Turn it off.

443
00:50:50,657 --> 00:50:53,990
Sing, stop that thing.
I'm taking this bastard down.

444
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:55,785
Move!

445
00:50:55,862 --> 00:50:58,194
- How do you turn it off?
- Tell him how to stop it!

446
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,630
- One key will unlock it.
- Where is it?

447
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,793
- It's in the box.
- Box?

448
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:11,967
- Which key?
- Tell him which key it is.

449
00:51:12,045 --> 00:51:15,412
- Time is running out.
- Get down here right now, asshole!

450
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:18,475
What's more important to you, Officer...

451
00:51:18,551 --> 00:51:21,679
arresting me,
or the life of another human being?

452
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:23,513
Get down on your knees!

453
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:26,653
- Jesus!
- Help me!

454
00:51:28,428 --> 00:51:30,362
Yes, I am sick, Officer.

455
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,897
Tapp, it's none of the keys here!

456
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:35,799
Sick from the disease
eating away at me inside.

457
00:51:35,869 --> 00:51:38,895
Sick of people
who don't appreciate their blessings.

458
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:41,964
Sick of those
who scoff at the suffering of others.

459
00:51:44,944 --> 00:51:46,536
I'm sick of all.

460
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,822
No! Tapp. Shit.

461
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:08,733
I'll be back. Okay?

462
00:52:42,902 --> 00:52:44,767
Freeze! Or I'll shoot.

463
00:54:17,196 --> 00:54:19,357
Got you on your knees.

464
00:54:20,566 --> 00:54:22,898
You're running.

465
00:54:24,837 --> 00:54:27,670
You're running scared because we had you.

466
00:54:29,052 --> 00:54:31,282
I'm going to close this case.

467
00:54:32,855 --> 00:54:35,346
We've closed it. We're right, Sing.

468
00:54:36,192 --> 00:54:38,490
We're going to close this thing.

469
00:54:45,835 --> 00:54:47,598
<i>"X" marks the spot.</i>

470
00:54:50,373 --> 00:54:52,603
<i>We should search this room again.</i>

471
00:54:53,543 --> 00:54:55,477
<i>What are you doing over there?</i>

472
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:58,210
Excuse me.

473
00:54:59,248 --> 00:55:01,307
Just because I'm stuck
in this room with you...

474
00:55:01,384 --> 00:55:04,444
doesn't mean I have to report to you
every 10 seconds.

475
00:55:04,921 --> 00:55:08,482
I really don't see the point
in us not helping one other.

476
00:55:09,325 --> 00:55:12,055
What do you want me to do?
I'm on a leash.

477
00:55:12,228 --> 00:55:14,788
That's exactly why we need to talk.
We need to think.

478
00:55:14,864 --> 00:55:16,229
I am thinking.

479
00:55:16,299 --> 00:55:19,928
Then don't keep me in the dark
about what you're thinking.

480
00:55:22,672 --> 00:55:25,163
- Turn off the lights.
- What?

481
00:55:27,009 --> 00:55:29,705
- Turn them off, now, please!
- Why?

482
00:55:29,779 --> 00:55:32,111
Just turn them off for a second.

483
00:55:46,729 --> 00:55:48,390
Jesus! Behind you.

484
00:55:53,202 --> 00:55:57,195
- How come we didn't see that before?
- The lights in here hadn't charged it.

485
00:55:57,273 --> 00:56:00,470
It must be glow-in-the-dark paint
or something.

486
00:56:39,649 --> 00:56:41,947
- Open it.
- It's locked.

487
00:56:43,152 --> 00:56:46,644
The key. The one from my envelope.
Where is it?

488
00:56:49,992 --> 00:56:52,961
Where the fuck... Here.

489
00:57:21,157 --> 00:57:24,820
Cell phone. The most beautiful invention
on this planet.

490
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:33,066
Make that second most
beautiful invention.

491
00:57:33,135 --> 00:57:35,126
<i>- Give me that.</i>
<i>- Are you joking?</i>

492
00:57:35,204 --> 00:57:39,106
<i>You're gonna put something we found
in this room in your mouth?</i>

493
00:57:40,209 --> 00:57:43,701
Yes. I'm willing to risk it.
Give me that sweet cancer.

494
00:57:45,882 --> 00:57:48,749
I don't care, I really don't.
Give me one of those.

495
00:57:50,386 --> 00:57:52,752
<i>The cigarettes are harmless,
I promise.</i>

496
00:57:52,822 --> 00:57:56,724
<i>Smoking is only poisonous</i>
<i>when it ends in bloodshed.</i>

497
00:57:56,792 --> 00:58:00,250
<i>Think about this:</i>
<i>you don't need a gun to kill Adam.</i>

498
00:58:01,063 --> 00:58:03,463
May I please have a cigarette?

499
00:58:04,734 --> 00:58:06,634
I'm trying the police.

500
00:58:16,879 --> 00:58:18,005
Shit.

501
00:58:19,949 --> 00:58:23,043
This was meant to receive calls,
not make them.

502
00:58:24,987 --> 00:58:28,479
Wait a minute. This has happened before.

503
00:58:32,795 --> 00:58:35,992
<i>Last night,
after I finished at the hospital...</i>

504
00:58:38,668 --> 00:58:40,829
<i>I was walking back to my car.</i>

505
00:58:42,772 --> 00:58:47,368
<i>I thought I was alone, but I'm
sure someone else was there.</i>

506
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
That thing. It was waiting for me.

507
01:00:30,713 --> 01:00:33,253
How did you know to
turn off the lights?

508
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,740
Who cares? It worked.

509
01:00:34,817 --> 01:00:37,684
- Yeah, but how did you know?
- Instinct.

510
01:00:38,454 --> 01:00:40,046
- Instinct?
- Yeah.

511
01:00:40,823 --> 01:00:44,122
You know what? You're a terrible liar.

512
01:00:45,027 --> 01:00:47,291
You say that like you know me.

513
01:00:48,464 --> 01:00:50,796
What else aren't you telling me?

514
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,628
Let's see.

515
01:00:53,669 --> 01:00:57,196
On my sixth birthday, my best
friend at that time, Scott Tibbs...

516
01:00:57,273 --> 01:00:59,639
stabbed me with a rusty nail.
I didn't tell you that.

517
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:02,643
I didn't tell you my last girlfriend,
a feminist vegan punk...

518
01:01:02,711 --> 01:01:05,043
broke up with me
because she thought I was too angry.

519
01:01:05,147 --> 01:01:07,920
I haven't told you
that one of my toenails...

520
01:01:07,921 --> 01:01:08,583
Stop it.

521
01:01:09,518 --> 01:01:12,954
- You knew to turn off these lights.
- Whatever.

522
01:01:13,722 --> 01:01:15,849
I'm dealing with a juvenile.

523
01:01:16,425 --> 01:01:18,393
- You wanna know?
- Yeah.

524
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:22,795
Here it is.

525
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,508
Oh, God!

526
01:01:44,954 --> 01:01:47,115
Where did you get this?

527
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:51,051
It was in your wallet,
behind the photo of your daughter.

528
01:01:51,127 --> 01:01:55,655
- Why didn't you show me this before?
- I couldn't.

529
01:02:00,636 --> 01:02:01,967
I'm sorry.

530
01:02:12,548 --> 01:02:15,312
What are you doing to them, you bastard?

531
01:02:26,896 --> 01:02:28,955
Okay, I got to think now.

532
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:35,902
<i>Think about this:</i>
<i>you don't need a gun to kill Adam.</i>

533
01:02:37,006 --> 01:02:39,394
<i>When there is that much
poison in your blood,</i>

534
01:02:39,395 --> 01:02:41,602
<i>in your blood, the only
thing left to do...</i>

535
01:02:41,677 --> 01:02:43,338
<i>is shoot yourself.</i>

536
01:03:17,179 --> 01:03:18,942
What are you doing?

537
01:03:26,488 --> 01:03:27,648
<i>Hey!</i>

538
01:03:27,723 --> 01:03:29,850
What the hell are you doing?

539
01:03:32,494 --> 01:03:36,294
Adam, listen to me.
I want you to play along with me on this.

540
01:03:43,806 --> 01:03:45,239
You got that?

541
01:03:58,087 --> 01:04:01,284
So, you still want that cigarette?

542
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:05,490
Yeah. Sure.

543
01:05:15,698 --> 01:05:17,723
There, I've done it!

544
01:05:18,434 --> 01:05:20,902
I've killed him with the poison,
just like you wanted!

545
01:05:20,969 --> 01:05:24,336
Now where is my family? Where are they?

546
01:05:34,883 --> 01:05:36,009
What?

547
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,218
- I just got electrocuted.
- What?

548
01:05:42,091 --> 01:05:45,549
- That was our way out.
- Did you hear what I said?

549
01:05:45,627 --> 01:05:48,323
Get this thing off me. Get it off!

550
01:05:48,397 --> 01:05:51,525
- Stop acting.
- You think I would make that up...

551
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,898
just to mess up
your stupid, fucking charade?

552
01:05:53,969 --> 01:05:55,459
All right, that's it!

553
01:06:11,186 --> 01:06:12,380
Damn it!

554
01:06:18,894 --> 01:06:20,885
I remember everything now.

555
01:06:22,965 --> 01:06:24,990
I remember how I got here.

556
01:08:14,376 --> 01:08:15,468
Great!

557
01:08:45,374 --> 01:08:46,898
Is someone there?

558
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:00,378
I can hear you.

559
01:09:35,557 --> 01:09:36,956
What the...

560
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

561
01:09:52,608 --> 01:09:54,007
What the...

562
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:04,251
Who is that? Who's in there?

563
01:10:06,455 --> 01:10:09,618
Come on out!
I'll kill you, you motherfucker.

564
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

565
01:10:53,735 --> 01:10:56,397
- Who is this?
<i>- Daddy?</i>

566
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:01,066
- Diana?
- Daddy, is that you?

567
01:11:02,978 --> 01:11:05,173
Yeah, baby, it's me. I'm here.

568
01:11:05,247 --> 01:11:07,681
I'm scared, Daddy.

569
01:11:07,883 --> 01:11:10,681
Don't worry, honey.
Everything's going to be okay.

570
01:11:10,752 --> 01:11:14,381
<i>- Where is Mommy?</i>
- She's here with me.

571
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:18,817
Let me talk to her, sweetie.
Okay? Put Mommy on.

572
01:11:19,461 --> 01:11:22,157
The bad man from my room is here.

573
01:11:22,664 --> 01:11:24,461
<i>He has us tied up...</i>

574
01:11:26,501 --> 01:11:28,196
and he has a gun.

575
01:11:29,738 --> 01:11:30,830
What man?

576
01:11:30,906 --> 01:11:32,737
<i>Please come home, Daddy.</i>

577
01:11:34,309 --> 01:11:35,469
Hello?

578
01:11:38,547 --> 01:11:39,741
Diana?

579
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,684
- Larry?
- Ali?

580
01:11:52,355 --> 01:11:53,879
Is Adam there?

581
01:11:56,359 --> 01:11:57,917
How do you know?

582
01:11:59,228 --> 01:12:02,254
Ali, what is going on?

583
01:12:03,966 --> 01:12:06,059
Don't believe Adam's lies.

584
01:12:07,136 --> 01:12:08,244
<i>He knows you.</i>

585
01:12:08,245 --> 01:12:10,572
<i>He knew all about
you before today.</i>

586
01:12:15,478 --> 01:12:17,742
Hello? Ali?

587
01:12:21,651 --> 01:12:22,845
Hello?

588
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:25,186
God damn you!

589
01:12:25,488 --> 01:12:29,219
If you so much as lay a finger on them,
I'll kill you! Do you hear me?

590
01:12:29,292 --> 01:12:31,783
You son of a bitch. I'll kill you!

591
01:12:41,837 --> 01:12:43,361
Are they okay?

592
01:12:46,442 --> 01:12:50,208
My wife, she mentioned your name.

593
01:12:52,548 --> 01:12:54,175
What did she say?

594
01:12:55,751 --> 01:12:57,241
She told me...

595
01:12:58,788 --> 01:13:00,517
not to believe you.

596
01:13:01,657 --> 01:13:03,522
Believe me about what?

597
01:13:05,861 --> 01:13:08,386
She told me you know me.

598
01:13:12,935 --> 01:13:14,300
Who are you?

599
01:13:15,538 --> 01:13:16,937
You know who I am.

600
01:13:17,006 --> 01:13:19,668
Stop the lies. You're a liar!

601
01:13:20,042 --> 01:13:22,067
I need to know the truth!

602
01:13:24,046 --> 01:13:25,445
I'm a liar?

603
01:13:27,283 --> 01:13:29,877
What did you do last night, Lawrence?

604
01:13:30,052 --> 01:13:32,919
Work at a hospital? Saving sick children?

605
01:13:33,022 --> 01:13:35,893
You told me that after you
left your house last night,

606
01:13:35,894 --> 01:13:37,459
you went to work at a hospital.

607
01:13:37,526 --> 01:13:39,289
That's because it's the truth.

608
01:13:39,362 --> 01:13:43,264
No, it's not. Your wife is right, Larry.

609
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,459
You don't recall getting your
picture taken in that parking lot?

610
01:14:05,921 --> 01:14:10,051
I can prove that you didn't go
anywhere near a hospital last night.

611
01:14:17,066 --> 01:14:19,557
It's not the first time
I've done it either, Larry.

612
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:21,967
I've been taking pictures of you
for a few days now.

613
01:14:28,311 --> 01:14:29,403
Why?

614
01:14:29,478 --> 01:14:33,141
Wanna know what I do? I get paid
to take pictures of rich guys like you...

615
01:14:33,215 --> 01:14:36,548
who go to seedy, out-of-the-way motels
to fuck their secretaries.

616
01:14:36,619 --> 01:14:39,986
Last night I went to your house.
I watched you leave.

617
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:42,517
<i>I followed you...</i>

618
01:14:43,759 --> 01:14:46,193
<i>all the way to that shitbag hotel.</i>

619
01:14:49,365 --> 01:14:52,664
You've had these with you the whole time?

620
01:14:53,048 --> 01:14:55,949
I found them in there, with the hacksaws.

621
01:14:56,485 --> 01:14:58,851
<i>I don't know how they got there.</i>

622
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,887
Yeah, right. You're so full of it!

623
01:15:02,391 --> 01:15:06,020
Face it, Larry, we're both bullshitters,
but my camera isn't.

624
01:15:06,094 --> 01:15:07,617
It doesn't know how to lie.

625
01:15:07,618 --> 01:15:10,155
It shows you what's put
right in front of it.

626
01:15:10,232 --> 01:15:13,724
Just out of curiosity,
what did you do in that motel room?

627
01:15:13,802 --> 01:15:16,202
You got out of there pretty fast.

628
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,749
Why did you deem it necessary
to page me when you knew I was at home?

629
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:34,488
I didn't know if you were gonna make it.

630
01:15:34,556 --> 01:15:38,151
But I gave you a precise time
at which to page me.

631
01:15:39,961 --> 01:15:41,656
You can't do that.

632
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:45,366
It's not like I know the rules
for this sort of stuff.

633
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:50,495
What's wrong, Dr. Gordon?

634
01:15:53,008 --> 01:15:56,068
Look, it was wrong of me
to make you come here.

635
01:15:56,144 --> 01:15:59,204
- But I thought we...
- Please.

636
01:16:02,017 --> 01:16:03,348
I'm sorry.

637
01:16:16,364 --> 01:16:19,197
- You tell anyone you were here?
- No.

638
01:16:30,412 --> 01:16:31,572
Hello?

639
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:39,145
- It's for you.
- For me?

640
01:16:53,268 --> 01:16:54,394
Hello?

641
01:16:56,605 --> 01:16:59,904
<i>I know what you're doing, Doctor.</i>

642
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:17,450
- I have to go.
- What happened?

643
01:17:17,526 --> 01:17:18,550
I got to go.

644
01:17:38,013 --> 01:17:40,243
- Who was it?
- Who was what?

645
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:43,049
The person who paid you to follow me?
Who was it?

646
01:17:43,118 --> 01:17:45,848
He calls himself Bob
and he gives me the money up front.

647
01:17:45,921 --> 01:17:47,411
$200 a night.

648
01:17:47,489 --> 01:17:50,424
If I knew I was gonna end up here,
I would've asked for more.

649
01:17:50,492 --> 01:17:53,518
Does that mean
you saw what happened to me?

650
01:17:53,595 --> 01:17:56,792
What I saw was you get into your car.
That's it.

651
01:17:57,265 --> 01:17:59,893
I didn't ask your name.
I didn't know who you were.

652
01:17:59,968 --> 01:18:03,369
I don't know how I got here,
I don't know how you got here.

653
01:18:03,438 --> 01:18:07,306
<i>I just took the shots</i>
<i>and went straight home to develop.</i>

654
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:09,866
Next thing I know,
I'm chained to a pipe...

655
01:18:09,945 --> 01:18:11,936
in some pre-historic bathroom...

656
01:18:12,013 --> 01:18:14,504
staring at the guy
I've been taking shots of all night.

657
01:18:14,583 --> 01:18:16,195
Clearly, whoever paid you to take

658
01:18:16,196 --> 01:18:18,246
pictures of me is the
one who put us here.

659
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,651
- Maybe.
- What do you mean maybe?

660
01:18:19,721 --> 01:18:21,416
Of course it is. What did he look like?

661
01:18:21,489 --> 01:18:24,014
- He was just a guy.
- Was he tall, skinny, obese, what?

662
01:18:24,092 --> 01:18:25,821
I don't take notes about his appearance.

663
01:18:25,894 --> 01:18:27,885
- You must remember something of him.
- I can't.

664
01:18:27,963 --> 01:18:29,794
You don't remember a thing about the guy?

665
01:18:29,864 --> 01:18:32,628
- I told you...
- For fuck's sake! I give up!

666
01:18:32,701 --> 01:18:36,398
He's a tall, black guy.
He's got a scar around his neck, okay?

667
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:47,606
Tapp!

668
01:18:50,585 --> 01:18:52,109
Det. Tapp.

669
01:18:53,588 --> 01:18:56,819
The guy who paid me to take these photos
was not a cop.

670
01:18:56,891 --> 01:18:59,883
No. He was discharged
from the police force.

671
01:19:00,362 --> 01:19:02,562
He broke down after
his partner was killed.

672
01:19:02,563 --> 01:19:04,662
But that didn't stop
him from harassing me.

673
01:19:04,733 --> 01:19:06,667
The guy became obsessed.

674
01:19:06,735 --> 01:19:10,398
He convinced himself I must have
somehow been involved with the murders...

675
01:19:11,539 --> 01:19:12,699
And you helped him.

676
01:19:12,774 --> 01:19:15,743
You took money from him
to invade my privacy.

677
01:19:16,994 --> 01:19:20,020
- How could you do that?
- Call it my need to eat.

678
01:19:20,097 --> 01:19:21,257
Right.

679
01:19:21,999 --> 01:19:24,866
You know what?
You're not a victim of this game...

680
01:19:24,935 --> 01:19:26,664
- you're a part of it.
- Really?

681
01:19:26,737 --> 01:19:29,433
Obviously this cop thinks
you're the one behind it all.

682
01:19:29,506 --> 01:19:31,371
I told you, he's not a cop.

683
01:19:31,442 --> 01:19:35,105
- He's a bottom feeder. Just like you.
- What are you more pissed off about?

684
01:19:35,179 --> 01:19:36,806
That I took some shots of you...

685
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,713
or that I took shots
while you were cheating on your wife?

686
01:19:39,783 --> 01:19:43,048
- I did not cheat on her!
- Why do you care what I think anyway?

687
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:46,055
I don't give a crap if you covered
yourself in peanut butter...

688
01:19:46,123 --> 01:19:48,318
and had a 15 hooker gang-bang.

689
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,069
How did I get here?

690
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:07,834
I had everything in order.

691
01:20:10,114 --> 01:20:12,582
My whole life was in perfect order.

692
01:20:39,843 --> 01:20:42,209
Sweetheart, are you okay?

693
01:20:45,182 --> 01:20:49,516
Mommy just needs you
to be really strong right now.

694
01:20:51,255 --> 01:20:56,056
I'm not going to let anybody hurt you.
You got that?

695
01:20:57,227 --> 01:20:59,058
That's my good girl.

696
01:21:23,053 --> 01:21:26,784
<i>Hey, was there someone else</i>
<i>at your house last night...</i>

697
01:21:26,857 --> 01:21:29,587
<i>- besides your wife and daughter?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

698
01:21:30,294 --> 01:21:32,353
<i>Well, there's someone here.</i>

699
01:21:49,379 --> 01:21:51,711
I know him. Zep!

700
01:21:54,084 --> 01:21:55,676
His name is Zep.

701
01:21:56,086 --> 01:21:58,384
He's an orderly in my hospital.

702
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,281
You perverted little psychopath.

703
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:05,988
I'm gonna take great pleasure
in seeing you pay for this!

704
01:22:06,063 --> 01:22:07,963
You bastard! Fuck!

705
01:22:11,602 --> 01:22:12,694
Look.

706
01:22:19,176 --> 01:22:20,837
We're out of time.

707
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:46,601
- It's okay.
- Mommy, help me.

708
01:23:04,821 --> 01:23:07,016
Dr. Gordon's time is up.

709
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:11,358
Now I gotta do what I've gotta do, and...

710
01:23:12,763 --> 01:23:16,426
I'm afraid it has to be you
that tells him he failed.

711
01:23:28,245 --> 01:23:32,375
Is that you, Zep, you bastard!
I know it's you, you son of a bitch!

712
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:35,181
<i>- Larry.</i>
- Ali?

713
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:38,219
You failed.

714
01:23:40,257 --> 01:23:41,383
Hello?

715
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:52,825
Don't move! Stay on the ground.

716
01:23:53,637 --> 01:23:55,332
Give me the phone.

717
01:23:56,173 --> 01:23:57,640
Give it to me!

718
01:24:09,853 --> 01:24:11,684
- Larry?
- Ali!

719
01:24:12,389 --> 01:24:14,653
- Honey, are you all right?
- No.

720
01:24:15,492 --> 01:24:17,619
No, we're not... Get down!

721
01:24:18,128 --> 01:24:19,925
Larry, where are you?

722
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:20,965
I don't know.

723
01:24:20,966 --> 01:24:23,725
I'm being held captive
in a room somewhere.

724
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,200
What are you talking about?

725
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:29,538
<i>- I'm so sorry, Ali.</i>
- Larry, we need you here.

726
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:31,972
<i>I'm sorry for everything.
It's my fault.</i>

727
01:24:32,042 --> 01:24:34,738
Please forgive me.
I've always been happy with you.

728
01:24:34,793 --> 01:24:35,953
Mommy.

729
01:24:41,967 --> 01:24:43,025
Ali!

730
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:08,883
Mommy, help me.

731
01:25:24,043 --> 01:25:25,237
Freeze!

732
01:25:36,155 --> 01:25:37,349
Oh, no.

733
01:25:42,127 --> 01:25:43,651
What the fuck?

734
01:26:10,522 --> 01:26:11,921
Mrs. Gordon?

735
01:26:15,527 --> 01:26:16,721
Diana?

736
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,535
I'm gonna kill your husband now,
Mrs. Gordon.

737
01:26:53,866 --> 01:26:55,128
Lawrence!

738
01:27:00,038 --> 01:27:01,266
Lawrence, get up!

739
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

740
01:27:13,018 --> 01:27:15,384
Lawrence, get up!

741
01:27:16,555 --> 01:27:17,920
I need you.

742
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:34,971
Thank God! I thought you were dead.

743
01:27:41,747 --> 01:27:44,443
- He electrocuted me.
- I told you.

744
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:48,377
The same thing happened to me, see?
I wasn't lying, see?

745
01:27:49,321 --> 01:27:50,879
Fuck this shit!

746
01:28:56,388 --> 01:28:58,948
I'm gonna kill you, you sick asshole.

747
01:28:59,157 --> 01:29:00,351
No!

748
01:29:03,028 --> 01:29:04,655
Lawrence, calm down.

749
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:07,858
- There must be a way out of here.
- I can't be calm!

750
01:29:08,367 --> 01:29:10,096
My family needs me.

751
01:29:11,770 --> 01:29:13,397
No, God!

752
01:29:40,699 --> 01:29:42,189
Stop it.

753
01:29:46,638 --> 01:29:48,765
Lawrence, please calm down.

754
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:51,809
There's a way out of here.
There's a way out.

755
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:57,810
No! Oh, my God!

756
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,049
What are you doing?

757
01:31:07,119 --> 01:31:09,280
Lawrence, what are you doing?

758
01:31:31,476 --> 01:31:33,103
What are you...

759
01:31:34,946 --> 01:31:36,345
Oh, my God!

760
01:31:39,851 --> 01:31:41,944
Lawrence, don't! No!

761
01:31:42,287 --> 01:31:45,085
Lawrence, please! I'm begging you.

762
01:31:46,658 --> 01:31:49,525
Lawrence, it's not me
who did this to you.

763
01:31:50,629 --> 01:31:53,223
- You have to die.
- No, I want to live.

764
01:31:53,765 --> 01:31:55,790
- I'm sorry.
- I want to live.

765
01:31:55,867 --> 01:31:57,334
My family...

766
01:32:13,185 --> 01:32:14,618
I've done it!

767
01:32:15,387 --> 01:32:17,252
Now show them to me.

768
01:32:22,928 --> 01:32:24,156
Thank you very much, Officer.

769
01:32:24,229 --> 01:32:26,663
- Larry?
- Did you get through to him?

770
01:32:26,731 --> 01:32:28,164
There's still no answer.

771
01:32:28,233 --> 01:32:31,896
It's all right. I've called the police.
Everything's okay.

772
01:32:47,953 --> 01:32:50,751
You bastard! I'll fucking kill you.

773
01:32:52,591 --> 01:32:55,890
You fucking bastard!
I'll fucking kill you!

774
01:33:11,243 --> 01:33:13,074
You're too late.

775
01:33:13,812 --> 01:33:16,940
- Why?
- It's the rules.

776
01:34:00,625 --> 01:34:04,652
You're going to be all right.
You're just wounded in the shoulder.

777
01:34:05,764 --> 01:34:08,631
I have to go and get help.

778
01:34:09,634 --> 01:34:12,899
If I don't get help...

779
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,034
I'm going to bleed to death.

780
01:34:18,109 --> 01:34:21,408
Don't leave me. No!

781
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:41,340
Don't worry, I'll bring someone back.
I promise.

782
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:48,610
Lawrence!

783
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:03,028
We're going to be okay?

784
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:07,264
I wouldn't lie to you.

785
01:35:28,923 --> 01:35:30,015
Key.

786
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:50,341
Key!

787
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:14,930
<i>Hello, Mr. Hindle...</i>

788
01:36:16,237 --> 01:36:20,298
<i>or as they called you</i>
<i>around the hospital: Zep.</i>

789
01:36:21,075 --> 01:36:23,236
<i>I want you to make a choice.</i>

790
01:36:27,248 --> 01:36:30,649
<i>There's a slow-acting poison</i>
<i>coursing through your system...</i>

791
01:36:30,718 --> 01:36:33,152
<i>that only I have the antidote for.</i>

792
01:36:33,821 --> 01:36:38,053
<i>Will you murder a mother and
her child to save yourself?</i>

793
01:36:38,693 --> 01:36:40,854
Dr. Gordon's time is up.

794
01:36:40,928 --> 01:36:42,327
Mrs. Gordon?

795
01:36:42,863 --> 01:36:46,355
<i>Listen carefully, if you will.
There are rules.</i>

796
01:36:46,601 --> 01:36:48,626
- Why?
- It's the rules.

797
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:39,811
Key to that chain is in the bathtub.

798
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:53,666
He's a very interesting person.
His name's John.

799
01:37:53,734 --> 01:37:56,100
He has an inoperable
frontal lobe tumor...

800
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:58,730
Sick from the disease
eating away at me inside.

801
01:37:58,806 --> 01:38:00,034
Sounds like our friend Jigsaw.

802
01:38:00,107 --> 01:38:02,632
<i>Sick of people who don't appreciate
their blessings.</i>

803
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:06,237
Looks like our guy likes to book himself
front row seats to his sick games.

804
01:38:06,313 --> 01:38:07,712
<i>Hello, Mark.</i>

805
01:38:09,016 --> 01:38:11,780
<i>Dr. Gordon, I want to play a game.</i>

806
01:38:38,145 --> 01:38:41,808
<i>Most people are so
ungrateful to be alive.</i>

807
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:46,486
<i>But not you. Not anymore.</i>

808
01:38:51,025 --> 01:38:52,390
Game over.

809
01:38:57,298 --> 01:38:58,595
Don't!
