1
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:45,066
Go! Go! Go!
: Go! Go!

2
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:46,918
: They've been here before.

3
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:50,758
Belgium, Osaka, Roswell:
those were recon missions.

4
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,439
They were testing our weakness.

5
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:58,285
Testing our capabilities.

6
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,719
But Phoenix was different.
: How was it different?

7
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:08,359
- It was only the beginning.

8
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,651
Come on!

9
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:22,826
- What the fuck is going on,
Mitch?!

10
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:30,122
- Jesus Christ, we gotta go!
We gotta go!

11
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:41,704
- Glenn, come on! Over here!
- Keep going! Go! Go! Go!

12
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:43,435
Come on!
- Come on, Jake! Come on, Jake!

13
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:44,552
- Aargh...!
- Come on!

14
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,241
- What the fuck is going...?

15
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,608
My God...

16
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:08,042
- Sorry, if I had known
I would've waited.

17
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:12,939
- Alright, well...
- We got plenty of time.

18
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:16,495
- You know, we'll go down,
we can get to the other side,

19
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:17,641
it'll be perfect.

20
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:22,922
Come on, come on, come on.
Pick it up, Jesus Christ.

21
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:27,948
Ryan! Let's go! Come on!
- You comin'?

22
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:30,537
- Cue to John Williams.

23
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:33,708
- Wow!
- Right?!

24
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:36,231
- Wow!

25
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:39,468
- You know how we're going down,
right, Jake?

26
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,187
- Put Ryan on Jake's back,
push Jake down the side.

27
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:44,428
- You've done this before,
right? Just sliding?

28
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:46,024
- ...ride you like an alpaca,
man!

29
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:48,268
I'm serious, you could do it.

30
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:50,638
You go first.
Come on, go first, you can.

31
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:52,647
- Wait! Camera! Camera, camera,
camera, camera!

32
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:54,728
: Four Phoenix area
residents are missing tonight

33
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,070
after a local camping trip
in the Estrella Mountains.

34
00:04:57,361 --> 00:04:59,533
- Despite the efforts
of the Arizona County Rescue

35
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,561
and the AHP,

36
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:02,796
officials continue
to scour the area

37
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,617
by ground and in the air,

38
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,110
but have found no sign
of the missing hikers.

39
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:10,829
The men were all experienced
riders, and were in good health.

40
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:12,936
- Susan Lauder hasn't heard
from her son Glenn

41
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:14,383
since Thursday morning
around 11 a.m.

42
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:16,299
- March 14th, 1997,

43
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:19,626
authorities recover
an abandoned ATV

44
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:22,347
belonging to 28-year-old
Glenn Lauder.

45
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,897
His food and water supplies are
found less than 50 feet away,

46
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,298
but Glenn is nowhere
in the area.

47
00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:29,995
- ...that provided
the first real clues

48
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,559
as to what may have happened

49
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,487
to the four missing riders
on March 14th.

50
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:35,724
- The individual committing
these abductions was

51
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:38,095
extremely methodical. The
location of the disappearance

52
00:05:38,193 --> 00:05:40,910
has led us to believe this was
the work of a lone perpetrator,

53
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,765
operating in a specific part
of the desert.

54
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:45,385
- New evidence
has come to light

55
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:47,016
linking the unexplained
disappearance

56
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,418
of four missing Arizona hikers.

57
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:52,075
- Sheriff's Officials arrest
Walton S. Gayson,

58
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:53,738
a retired Veteran
and religious fanatic,

59
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:56,269
with a long history
of confrontations with police.

60
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:58,922
- The Phoenix District
Attorney's Office says

61
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,959
Gayson was involved
in a fourth aggravated assault,

62
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:04,236
where he attacked a Maricopa
County Sheriff's station.

63
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,615
- Chilling testimony
from Walton S. Gayson,

64
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:18,215
now the prime suspect

65
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:21,256
in what investigators believe
may be a four-person homicide.

66
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:22,473
Gayson, seen...

67
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,330
: During
interrogation, Gayson confesses

68
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,190
he witnessed
the men's abduction,

69
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:29,257
but insisted the men were
taken by non-terrestrial beings.

70
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:52,936
: But before Gayson
can stand trial,

71
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,975
Gayson is taken
into Federal custody,

72
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,990
and all information
in the case is confiscated.

73
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,591
- Investigators from the FBI
will be reviewing the evidence

74
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,072
and will be making a statement
in the coming weeks. Thank you.

75
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:05,606
- Gayson absolutely committed
these murders,

76
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:08,102
there's no question
in my mind.

77
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:10,926
It's like we were being
sabotaged by our own country.

78
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:14,314
- You think this was
a conspiracy?

79
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,065
- Absolutely. Something happened
out there in the desert.

80
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:18,991
- What do you think happened?

81
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:20,813
- We got too close
to something much bigger;

82
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:22,669
the military
didn't want us to know.

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

84
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:14,544
- You're aware that,
by giving this interview,

85
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:16,528
they could come after you
and your family?

86
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:21,063
- Yeah, I know, I know.

87
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:24,682
- Okay, you ready to do this?
- Yeah, let's go.

88
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:29,482
- In 1997, you took part
in one of the largest

89
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:31,952
military cover-ups
in United States history.

90
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,707
- That's correct.

91
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:36,329
- And this involved
a direct engagement

92
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,189
with extra-terrestrial craft.

93
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,750
- That's correct.

94
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,188
- But the official defense
department reports

95
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,198
have never been disclosed.

96
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:48,337
- Congress doesn't even know
that this happened.

97
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:50,921
- This began March 13th, 1997,

98
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:54,472
during the single most
controversial UFO sighting

99
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:58,472
in North America known as
the "Phoenix Lights".

100
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:02,573
- Hey Sue! Take a look at this!

101
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:05,259
- The Phoenix Lights.
Tonight, lights in the sky.

102
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:07,434
- Phoenix, Arizona residents
are talking about

103
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:08,911
one of the nation's
largest UFO sightings.

104
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:12,270
- There was a case... oh... a
couple of years ago in Arizona,

105
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:15,784
of some lights that were seen
over Arizona.

106
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,823
Um, and that has never been
fully explained.

107
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:21,776
- Like a fleet of planes or
helicopters flying in formation.

108
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:24,873
- The first reports of the
strange flying object came in

109
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:26,631
about 8:20 p.m.

110
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:29,671
from a former police officer
in Paulden, Arizona.

111
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,944
- ...hundreds of eye witnesses
reported sightings--

112
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:34,350
: They've been here
before.

113
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,319
Belgium, Osaka, Roswell:
those were recon missions.

114
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:42,607
But Phoenix was different.

115
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:45,511
- How was it different?

116
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:51,759
- This was the first time we
knew what they were capable of.

117
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,188
The first time we'd been
provoked into an attack,

118
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:55,947
or maybe the first time
they were.

119
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:57,991
- And as a result

120
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,163
of this operation, four civilian
men became collateral damage.

121
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:05,958
- Yeah...

122
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:10,351
I don't think a night's gone by
in seventeen years

123
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:12,423
that I haven't thought about
what happened to those boys

124
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,773
that night.

125
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:16,143
- Get down!

126
00:10:20,113 --> 00:10:22,317
- Alright, so here's what I got.

127
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:26,093
See here, I had to cannibalize
a bunch of other cameras.

128
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,233
They are wrecked,
unfortunately, but, uh...

129
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:31,497
Yeah, that's right!
Hands free baby!

130
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:36,423
And, why hands free, you ask?
Lemme show you, with this...

131
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:37,838
Keeyah! Alright?!

132
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:40,585
You can do cool shit
like this... Pow!

133
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:44,169
Captain Fuckin' Magic, right?

134
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:48,135
- Uh, Glenn had mounted this
camera to the front of his bike

135
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,767
and actually one to his helmet,
too;

136
00:10:49,873 --> 00:10:51,978
the best we could do
at the time, you know.

137
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,837
But, like,
he recorded everything,

138
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:57,385
he managed to get every stunt
way before Go Pros or,

139
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:58,983
you know, any of the shit
we have now.

140
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:01,648
Glenn was, um,
never scared of shit.

141
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,817
He was just fearless.

142
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,542
Oh ho-ho.

143
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:08,332
- And you do realize how
ridiculous you look in all this,

144
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:09,993
right?
- You look ridic... Fuck you!

145
00:11:10,097 --> 00:11:13,709
- He saved up his own money
to buy his cameras.

146
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:18,218
He filmed stunts, tricks,

147
00:11:18,513 --> 00:11:20,422
anything you could film.

148
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:23,016
He was pointing that thing
at something.

149
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:28,999
Fuck yeah! Whoo!

150
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:36,809
- When they disappeared
it was...

151
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:39,880
it was like life just stopped.

152
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:45,352
They were so fun and...

153
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:47,399
and full of life.

154
00:11:49,617 --> 00:11:51,756
- You find me attractive!

155
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:53,675
- I think, that's my foot.

156
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:58,120
And then they were just gone.

157
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:02,768
Oh, you son of a bitch.

158
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:08,014
Hey... you son of a bitch!

159
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:14,511
So you are the best alarm clock
of all.

160
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,267
I know.

161
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,441
Alright, let's do this!

162
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:21,998
It's D-Day, motherfuckers!

163
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:23,919
Shut up! Shut up.

164
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,886
- Hey, are you sure you got
enough food for this weekend?

165
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:30,024
- Yeah, I got...
I got everything we need.

166
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:32,431
- I don't wanna eat bologna
and beer every day.

167
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:34,503
- No, I know. I know.

168
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:36,496
It'll be fine,
don't worry about it.

169
00:12:36,593 --> 00:12:37,837
- Where are we
even fuckin' going?

170
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:40,496
- Look, here, we can just...
We're right here...

171
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,284
- Why do we even have
to go that far?

172
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:44,424
Why can't we just, like,
hit a bar, or a...

173
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:47,791
- I'm not taking you to...
to 'Nam or anything...

174
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:50,027
- I just don't wanna get bit
by a fuckin' rattlesnake.

175
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:51,820
- Look, I'm doing this
as much for you

176
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:53,809
as I am for him, come on.

177
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:55,792
Fuck!

178
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:59,238
Yeah, I hear you! God dang.
Hey, hey, hey!

179
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,215
- What's up, man?!
- Ready? Whattup?!

180
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:05,550
- Look at Jacob, looking good,
buddy. Where's Ryan?

181
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:08,104
What? He's still asleep.

182
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:10,031
Sh-shh!

183
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:23,632
Whoo!
Give me some! Give me some!

184
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:26,544
Get the fuck outta here!

185
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:31,311
- Yeah, I know. No, I fucked it
up on that last jump,

186
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:33,830
it's not gonna zoom anymore.
- Oh, shit.

187
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:35,792
- It'll be fine, though,
I just can't zoom.

188
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:36,903
- It'll be great!

189
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:38,918
- "Bitches!"

190
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:43,023
Aw, man, if we don't get out
of here this day

191
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:45,390
it's 'cause of YOU, you...
What's the problem?

192
00:13:45,488 --> 00:13:47,877
- The zipper's stuck.
- No, it's not. Hold on.

193
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:55,152
- Leather.
- Smells like victory.

194
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:56,361
- Leather!

195
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,917
So good.

196
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:01,872
So good.

197
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:03,594
- Out, out, out!

198
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:06,828
- Out, out, out!
One! Two! Three!

199
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,838
- After you.
- Oh, thank you, love.

200
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:12,711
- I mean, for years,
they told us it was over.

201
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:15,337
You know, they couldn't
explain the reports,

202
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:17,034
the bone fragments,
the lack of evidence.

203
00:14:17,137 --> 00:14:19,504
How good do I look? Huh?

204
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,870
- No one would help us.

205
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:24,335
I mean, if... if our boys are
dead, where are the bodies?

206
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:27,945
You guys look great.

207
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:31,147
- But no parent should have
to outlive their kid.

208
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:34,539
We just wanna know
what happened to our boys.

209
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:39,339
- What?

210
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,047
- By coming forward
with this information now

211
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:44,909
you risk exposing
a military operation

212
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:47,725
that led to the disappearance
of these four men.

213
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:52,685
How did you become
involved with this event?

214
00:14:53,648 --> 00:14:55,536
- In 1997, I was stationed
at Luke Air Force Base

215
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,421
in Phoenix, Arizona
as part of a special operations

216
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,757
aerial unit.

217
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:02,158
- And the weeks
leading up to the incident,

218
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:03,718
had you experienced
any warning signs

219
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:05,166
about an impending attack?

220
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:08,363
- There were reports
of livestock mutilations,

221
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:11,367
things of that nature
on our side of the spectrum.

222
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:13,033
We had experienced, uh...
atmospheric anomalies

223
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:14,992
about 50 clicks west
of the range.

224
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:17,063
- That's in an area where
the four men were abducted?

225
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:18,063
- That's right.

226
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,949
- But there was
no other indication

227
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,798
of an attack or an invasion?
- No. No, not at that time.

228
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:24,358
- And leading up
to the incident,

229
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:25,838
were you or your superiors
aware

230
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:28,104
of the four civilian men
prior to that night?

231
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,510
- No, we were not.
- Walton Gayson?

232
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:32,103
- No.

233
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,063
- Were you aware that the men
had been recording themselves?

234
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:35,950
Did you... did you know
that the footage existed?

235
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:37,390
- Not at that time,

236
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:39,142
I have subsequently
become aware of that.

237
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:51,081
I thought you had to piss?!

238
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:55,309
- Dude.
- Can I get space?

239
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:56,423
Dude!

240
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:00,904
- All right, fine!
Is this what you want?

241
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:02,154
This is what I want.

242
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:04,874
- It's gonna take me a minute,
hold on, with you watchin'.

243
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:06,952
- Are you pee shy? Don't move.

244
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:09,991
I'm gonna try to get it
between your legs.

245
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:12,623
- Nobody look,
I get really embarrassed.

246
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,622
- Oh my God,
what are you doing?

247
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:18,347
Holy shit.

248
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:22,409
Did that freak you out
at all? Is that gay?

249
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:24,139
Is this intimidating anybody?

250
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,826
Is that a squirt bottle?

251
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:29,197
Got it on my shorts.

252
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,588
- That's what happens
when you pee into the wind.

253
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:34,925
- Off a tire, into the wind.

254
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:37,807
- My father would be so proud.
God.

255
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:42,125
- At that time Hale-Bopp
was making its approach

256
00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:43,402
to the North-West.

257
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,504
0430 Nor Comm El Paso reported

258
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:50,346
a... a triangular shape

259
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:53,805
that was trailing
behind the comet's tail.

260
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:57,548
- Did you know
what the object was?

261
00:16:57,648 --> 00:16:59,787
- They referred to it
as a Chevron,

262
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:02,823
but no, nobody knew
what the hell it was.

263
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:05,576
At 0700 there was traffic
about a separation.

264
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,102
The object had been following
the comet

265
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,405
until 1.32 aeronautical units,
at which time

266
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:13,031
it began a break-off

267
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:15,177
and a rapid descent
into our atmosphere.

268
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,444
- And was there any
indication where it was heading?

269
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:21,579
- Yeah, somewhere over Arizona.

270
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:23,820
- Yeah, this is how it begins!

271
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,335
- We're gonna have
to stop for gas first.

272
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:29,383
- Sup, buddy?
- Whoa! Hello-o.

273
00:17:29,488 --> 00:17:32,139
- We should take those, yeah?
- Yeah, I know, right?

274
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:33,867
Hey, here, take it, take it,
take it.

275
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:35,790
I gotta show ya something.
I've been practicing.

276
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,863
- Come on, man, I thought
you were ready to go!

277
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:40,750
Here, ready?

278
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:43,466
You son of a bitch!

279
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:46,350
- That's just like the best
thing I have ever seen.

280
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:47,757
- No, it's not!

281
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:50,125
- Mitch was a good kid.

282
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:54,191
He didn't deserve any of this.

283
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:56,361
- Well, the family took
the disappearance really hard.

284
00:17:56,464 --> 00:17:58,799
Especially since
Mitch's brother Mark,

285
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:01,831
he, uh, died in a helicopter
crash

286
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:05,035
in '92, two years
after the Gulf War.

287
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:08,143
- You know, I think that's why
Mitch and Glenn had that...

288
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:09,959
I, I think, you know,

289
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:12,912
growing up around military,
they, they were like family,

290
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:15,339
you know, they uh...
they were close,

291
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:17,164
they were really
tight knit,

292
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,435
and... and once Mark passed
on, definitely more so, I think,

293
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:21,445
like, Glenn became
like a brother to Mitch.

294
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:36,358
- You could model...
- Don't "big brother" him right now.

295
00:18:36,464 --> 00:18:38,286
- Just be nice,
you just gotta be nice.

296
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:41,319
- Look, I'm being nice, I'm
telling him that he's brilliant.

297
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:43,595
So, why aren't you painting?
You never paint.

298
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:44,871
- I do paint.

299
00:18:44,976 --> 00:18:46,799
- Dude, how come
you don't make music.

300
00:18:46,896 --> 00:18:49,100
If you're a...
if you're all a musician...

301
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,233
- Ooh, I like it! That's a...
that's a very good idea!

302
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:54,122
- This is not about me,
this is about him.

303
00:18:54,224 --> 00:18:55,534
- "Why don't you
make music?"

304
00:18:55,632 --> 00:18:57,542
- You know why he doesn't have
to make music?

305
00:18:57,648 --> 00:18:58,925
Because he dresses like
he makes music,

306
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:00,453
and that's the important part.

307
00:19:00,561 --> 00:19:02,765
- You know what
that the difference is,

308
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:06,028
is I'm gonna be
a librarian who paints.

309
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,910
You're gonna fuckin' go
to L.A. and you're gonna...

310
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:10,983
you know, we're gonna listen
to you on the radio.

311
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:13,227
- Damn straight.
- You know, you're my best friend,

312
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:15,849
but you need to get
the fuck away from me

313
00:19:15,952 --> 00:19:18,156
and get the hell out of here...
You know...

314
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,456
- You said I was
your best friend.

315
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:21,738
- Only on Sunday nights.

316
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,655
- You two belong.
- I'm gonna go smoke pot.

317
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:26,662
- Run, keep running,
all the way to the coast.

318
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:29,038
- If you don't, if you don't
come back,

319
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:30,991
we know you've gone
to Los Angeles

320
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,095
to be a rock 'n' roll star.

321
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,041
- Dude...
- Turn the fuckin' camera off.

322
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:42,511
- You just fuckin' ran
outta there?

323
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:44,942
- Turn the fucking camera off,
please.

324
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,910
- ...fuckin' problem, man.
Fuck that guy, dude...

325
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:49,191
I love him, I know...

326
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:51,151
- Ryan, he's doing it because
he loves you...

327
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:53,223
- No, he's not.
The only reason why he...

328
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:56,143
- No, we all do, 'cause we want you...
because we know you're fuckin' good.

329
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:58,215
- I get it.
But I don't need to hear it

330
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,175
from fucking Jake
who can't get over his wife,

331
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:02,061
who won't take his fuckin'
wedding ring off,

332
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,299
that I need to change my life
and do something with him.

333
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:06,665
Why doesn't he get off his ass
and do anything?

334
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:09,703
- That's his problem.
- It's his problem, but I don't need to be...

335
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,710
I know what I'm doing
with my life and at least...

336
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:15,150
out of the four of us,
I've got...

337
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,190
I've got a plan
to do something,

338
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:19,947
I'm not just sitting on my ass
and, and...

339
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:21,935
I don't know, dude.
You can't just...

340
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:24,782
I'm willing to do it. I'll pack
everything that I have

341
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:26,768
in the back of my car
and fucking drive,

342
00:20:26,864 --> 00:20:28,904
and I'll get there.
And I'll pump gas,

343
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:32,456
I'll paint houses, I don't
give a shit what I have to do.

344
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:34,633
Well, just... Maybe there's
a side of me

345
00:20:34,737 --> 00:20:37,770
that doesn't wanna leave,
I mean... I don't know, I mean,

346
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:39,563
- I'm... certainly
not one to talk...

347
00:20:39,664 --> 00:20:41,639
- Yeah, I know, I know,
we're good.

348
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:46,863
- You don't believe Gayson
acted alone?

349
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:48,749
- When you're doing
a criminal investigation,

350
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,026
you look at every possibility,

351
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:52,517
and then you consider the
impossible. The impossible was

352
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,829
that four healthy, young men
could have been overpowered,

353
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:56,838
abducted, and murdered
by a single individual.

354
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:13,132
- We have a very limited time

355
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:15,654
that we get to talk to each
other, so, uh,

356
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:18,510
I would kind of like to get to
some questions that I have,

357
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:20,844
I've been wanting to ask you
for quite a while.

358
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:24,845
So, if you don't mind,
are you ready to, uh...

359
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:28,263
ready to begin?

360
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:30,702
- You don't want
to shake hands first?

361
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:34,472
- I don't think we're allowed
to actually touch each other,

362
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:36,940
Mr. Gayson, but I appreciate
the offer.

363
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,691
- Courtesy.
- But why did your department

364
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:41,483
release Gayson
after the incident?

365
00:21:41,585 --> 00:21:44,105
- We're following protocol.
We investigate the case.

366
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,466
We investigate the leads.
We hit a dead end.

367
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:50,285
- Yeah, but you had
a suspect in custody.

368
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,615
- We had a suspect

369
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:57,869
who said that he witnessed
the men in the area,

370
00:21:57,968 --> 00:21:59,943
but there wasn't
enough evidence to hold him.

371
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:01,739
- So you're saying
your department released

372
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:03,783
the last person
to see the men alive?

373
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:06,823
- No one took him seriously.

374
00:22:06,928 --> 00:22:11,630
He was a bit of a, a bit of a...
a bit unstable.

375
00:22:11,728 --> 00:22:13,867
- When history paints
a picture of me,

376
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,324
it will say I was
the monster that took them.

377
00:22:19,344 --> 00:22:23,239
I wasn't the real monster.

378
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,207
- I didn't fuckin' feel it
at first.

379
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:29,963
Because of the shock, yeah.
And then I look down,

380
00:22:30,064 --> 00:22:32,584
and the branch is literally
sticking through my thigh.

381
00:22:32,688 --> 00:22:34,957
- You always laugh
when you get hurt.

382
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:37,638
Show and tell! Whoa.

383
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:41,707
- Hey, do you have your
Frankenstein, helmet rig thing?

384
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,105
- Oh! Yeah!
Get it out the bag in the back.

385
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,484
Record button's on the side,

386
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:47,472
just mash it
and it starts recording.

387
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,877
- He'll be the first man
on earth

388
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:53,707
to film his own death.
Well done.

389
00:22:53,808 --> 00:22:54,855
- Pretty cool little thing.

390
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,862
- Alright, check it out.
Yeah, yeah, you like that? Yep.

391
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:01,485
- Hey, guys! Something's going
on over there.

392
00:23:01,584 --> 00:23:03,689
- What, what's up?
- Check it out.

393
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:06,094
What's going on?

394
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:08,047
- What is it? What's up?

395
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:10,348
- I don't know.
- What the fuck?

396
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:12,685
- By 0900 multiple
atmospheric distortions

397
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:14,191
began appearing
across the state.

398
00:23:14,288 --> 00:23:16,841
- In the same position
as the previous sightings.

399
00:23:16,944 --> 00:23:17,959
- That's right.

400
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,747
Uh, the Nevada border,
Paulden, and Flagstaff.

401
00:23:20,848 --> 00:23:23,237
- Those were the same
warning indicators

402
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:25,646
that happened
in Russia and Syria.

403
00:23:25,744 --> 00:23:28,166
- We had two birds in the air,

404
00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:30,574
but there were no other
confirmed contacts

405
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:33,323
except for the formation.

406
00:23:42,449 --> 00:23:44,750
- Oh, shit...
- What is that?

407
00:23:44,848 --> 00:23:48,558
It's not normal.

408
00:23:48,656 --> 00:23:50,544
- What the fuck!?

409
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,462
- Goddamn it!
- Get out and check it, Jake.

410
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,534
- What did you hit?
Did you hit something?!

411
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,363
- I didn't do anything!
Goddamn it!

412
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:58,351
- Would you come look at this?
- I'm on it.

413
00:23:58,448 --> 00:24:00,172
- Did you ever put oil in this?
- Fuck you.

414
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,661
- How far is it to your folks'
place, maybe we can walk?

415
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:04,655
- No, no. It's at least
15 miles or more.

416
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:06,825
I don't even know
where we are out here.

417
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:09,099
- I don't think AAA's gonna
come out this far.

418
00:24:09,392 --> 00:24:11,563
- Well, I don't think anybody's
coming out this far,

419
00:24:11,664 --> 00:24:12,646
that's the whole point.

420
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,411
- I'm sorry, guys,
this is my fault.

421
00:24:14,512 --> 00:24:15,657
- No. Don't worry about it.

422
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,443
Look, we'll try and find a
phone, see if anybody's there

423
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:19,886
we can call for help, yeah?

424
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:22,832
- I'll stay here and see
if I can at least get it runnin'

425
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,349
or something. I'll get it
patched up, if I can,

426
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:27,143
and you can meet us back
here, alright?

427
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:29,004
- Jake, you're... yeah?
- Yeah, we're good.

428
00:24:29,104 --> 00:24:32,682
- Dude, she's a big girl,
she'll be fine.

429
00:24:32,784 --> 00:24:34,922
- Well, I don't like it.

430
00:24:39,664 --> 00:24:41,224
- Whoo! Yeah!

431
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:42,702
- ...but Ryan got there like,

432
00:24:42,992 --> 00:24:46,985
his nut sweat stain was like
a third of the size of yours,

433
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:49,128
which makes no sense at all.
- It was cold!

434
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:50,988
- Do you remember that?
He was like,

435
00:24:51,088 --> 00:24:53,477
"No! My nuts are starting
to get sweaty, that's why.

436
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:54,632
They just look smaller!"

437
00:24:54,736 --> 00:24:55,630
- Shut up.

438
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,703
- Screamin', "I was in the
pool! I was in the pool!"

439
00:24:59,888 --> 00:25:02,441
- Were the four men aware
of the impending operation?

440
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:06,188
Do you think they had any idea
of what was about to happen?

441
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:09,932
- Now y-y-you-you've asked me
some form of that question

442
00:25:10,032 --> 00:25:11,439
two or three times now,

443
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:13,768
and I've already given you
the answer:

444
00:25:13,872 --> 00:25:15,944
they didn't know,
we didn't know.

445
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,641
That's it,
that's not gonna change.

446
00:25:17,744 --> 00:25:20,526
Tire... I'm tired.

447
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:32,041
- Okay...

448
00:25:37,648 --> 00:25:40,812
- Hey, don't touch the fence,
I think it's electric.

449
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:41,861
- You think?

450
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:44,837
You think this thing's on?
- I don't know, man.

451
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:52,263
I hope it's not on, I just
picture a fat serial killer

452
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:53,961
on the other end,
just staring at us.

453
00:25:54,064 --> 00:25:55,657
Shut up, dude. Shut up.

454
00:26:00,912 --> 00:26:02,821
- So, what was the official
cause of death?

455
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:06,506
- They said that
Ryan had been attacked

456
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:09,674
by some kind of an animal.

457
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,646
The coroner said

458
00:26:12,752 --> 00:26:16,582
that they thought they found
what were his remains.

459
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:19,208
: Police say
the remains of the four men

460
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:21,385
have yet to be identified,
however officials

461
00:26:21,488 --> 00:26:23,757
are classifying this
as an animal attack,

462
00:26:23,856 --> 00:26:26,955
believing the men may have
become victims of a bear...

463
00:26:27,056 --> 00:26:29,096
:...the March 14th,
1997 attacks,

464
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,069
where 4 hikers disappeared
in the Estrella Sierra...

465
00:26:32,368 --> 00:26:33,710
- Following the coroner's
announcement,

466
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:35,815
the County Attorney's office
has suspended

467
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,189
further investigation
into the men's disappearance.

468
00:26:38,288 --> 00:26:40,677
- How many bodies
did you recover?

469
00:26:40,784 --> 00:26:43,948
- There were no bodies.
No tissue residue.

470
00:26:44,048 --> 00:26:47,277
Not even DNA could be
recovered from the site.

471
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:51,150
- So, in your opinion,
could this have been a bear?

472
00:26:51,248 --> 00:26:55,023
- No. Absolutely not.

473
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,549
- Everyone knew Gayson
would never testify.

474
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,860
So, the medical examiner was
instructed to classify the event

475
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,415
as a 'bear attack'. Families
never had any resolution

476
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,146
to what happened to their kids.

477
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,262
: Despite
public criticism

478
00:27:04,368 --> 00:27:06,124
of the Medical Examiner's
announcement,

479
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:08,842
the County Attorney's office
has suspended

480
00:27:08,944 --> 00:27:11,465
further investigation into
the men's disappearance.

481
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,134
- Givin' up over here, or what?

482
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:16,014
- I guarantee you he has never
put oil in this car.

483
00:27:16,112 --> 00:27:19,909
He can barely wipe his own ass,
how could he make it in L.A.?

484
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:22,950
- What's with you guys,
you used to be best friends?

485
00:27:23,248 --> 00:27:25,321
- I'll take that,
I've had enough of this.

486
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:31,237
I'll see
if there's anything else...

487
00:27:33,008 --> 00:27:36,106
- I'm gonna go try to find
some help with that road.

488
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:37,418
- Are you sure?

489
00:27:37,712 --> 00:27:40,745
- Yeah, it's not that far.
- Alright.

490
00:27:40,848 --> 00:27:42,822
- I'll be back.
- Be careful, alright?

491
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:43,943
- I will.

492
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:46,285
- I don't want Mitch
putting me in the ground.

493
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,769
Great... f...

494
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:53,703
- By 1100 hours, NORCOM
had lost visual with the object.

495
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,927
Within 30 minutes

496
00:27:55,024 --> 00:27:57,293
we had lost
two KH-12 satellites

497
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:58,919
over the Southwestern
atmosphere.

498
00:27:59,023 --> 00:28:01,871
- They were entering
our atmosphere?

499
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:03,910
- There were conflicting
reports, the...

500
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:07,757
It was a fuckin' mess, nobody
knew what they were lookin' for

501
00:28:07,856 --> 00:28:09,383
or where the hell to look.

502
00:28:11,568 --> 00:28:15,310
Well, Glenn, congratulations

503
00:28:15,408 --> 00:28:19,150
'cause we are pretty fucked
out here.

504
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:23,470
Uh, Ryan's car's
out of commission, so,

505
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,702
we're stuck, and...

506
00:28:25,808 --> 00:28:27,782
There isn't shit for miles.

507
00:28:27,888 --> 00:28:30,124
And judging by the look
of that shack

508
00:28:30,224 --> 00:28:31,980
you guys just headed off for,

509
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,854
I'm gonna guess you're about
to be chopped up into uh...

510
00:28:35,952 --> 00:28:38,822
hamburger meat, so,
let me just go on the record

511
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,680
and say 'I told you so'.

512
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:43,883
You know, this whole trip,
just... great fuckin' idea.

513
00:28:43,984 --> 00:28:45,545
- You need to leave!

514
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,044
You need to leave, now!

515
00:28:49,968 --> 00:28:52,521
- Were you with the men
the night they disappeared?

516
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,278
- I warned them...

517
00:29:01,327 --> 00:29:03,466
...but they came back.

518
00:29:03,568 --> 00:29:06,088
You need to leave!

519
00:29:06,192 --> 00:29:08,199
You need to get out!

520
00:29:12,368 --> 00:29:14,310
Fuck!

521
00:29:14,608 --> 00:29:16,037
- Authorities claim
you were responsible

522
00:29:16,144 --> 00:29:19,144
for the disappearance of those
men, but you've never spoken

523
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,000
about any military operation
that night.

524
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:23,242
Get away from my car!

525
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,646
: If you say so.

526
00:29:27,408 --> 00:29:29,513
- Why not come forward?

527
00:29:29,615 --> 00:29:31,339
Expose the truth?

528
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:35,433
- I have made peace
with my Lord,

529
00:29:35,728 --> 00:29:38,281
and He shall grant me
forgiveness.

530
00:29:39,568 --> 00:29:41,957
I can't say the same for you.

531
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:48,745
Whoa! Jesus!
- Open the fuckin' door!

532
00:29:48,848 --> 00:29:51,750
- Take it easy! Take it easy!
- Where is he? Where did he go?!

533
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:53,390
There was this fucking guy
right here!

534
00:29:53,488 --> 00:29:54,665
- What the fuck are you doing?

535
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,942
- There was some
fucking psychopath

536
00:29:56,047 --> 00:29:57,935
banging on the fucking car!
- Hey! Relax! Ryan! I...

537
00:29:58,032 --> 00:29:59,373
- I think I just peed
a little...

538
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:01,360
- I didn't see anybody, did you?
- What happened?

539
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:03,950
- Why don't you just
own up to the fact

540
00:30:04,048 --> 00:30:05,575
that you were beatin' off
in there.

541
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,469
- Look, can we get back
on the ATVs?

542
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:09,989
- I'm sorry I disturbed you,
all right?

543
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:12,743
- I mean, if we can expose
a conspiracy, then none of this

544
00:30:12,848 --> 00:30:15,750
has to happen again.
- It is happening...

545
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,641
- I think people believe
what they want to believe.

546
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
But in my heart, I know
Gayson killed those men.
- They come. They take.
They feed.
They have no pity,
no remorse.

547
00:30:27,888 --> 00:30:31,019
Their vision is pure.

548
00:30:34,928 --> 00:30:37,383
- See ya later.
- We're good!

549
00:30:37,488 --> 00:30:39,659
- I'll pick you up later
tonight!

550
00:30:51,888 --> 00:30:53,742
- Go! Come on, douchebag!
Let's go!

551
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,750
- Go on! I'm gonna catch up!

552
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:57,100
- Those boys found something
out there,

553
00:30:57,391 --> 00:30:58,853
something no one
was supposed to see.

554
00:31:03,247 --> 00:31:05,320
The police, they just
didn't wanna say what.

555
00:31:07,888 --> 00:31:09,961
- What do you think they found?

556
00:31:12,048 --> 00:31:14,022
- The truth.

557
00:31:14,128 --> 00:31:16,997
- And then you received a call
to stop the investigation?

558
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:21,323
- Can you shut that off?

559
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Our department...
was told to back down
by the Air Force
investigative commission.

560
00:31:32,911 --> 00:31:34,766
- We have recovered
circumstantial evidence

561
00:31:34,864 --> 00:31:38,180
of a possible connection
to an incident in Arizona...

562
00:31:38,288 --> 00:31:40,143
- We received a call.
They told us to suspend

563
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:41,549
all search and rescue
operations

564
00:31:41,647 --> 00:31:43,949
in the Estrella region,
so that's what we did.

565
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:46,503
- So you were told, essentially,
to back off?

566
00:31:46,607 --> 00:31:47,556
- Yes.

567
00:31:47,663 --> 00:31:50,860
- Well, would you say that that
was unusual for the military

568
00:31:51,151 --> 00:31:53,224
to intervene in a missing
persons investigation?

569
00:31:53,327 --> 00:31:56,011
- Yeah. I'd say
that's very unusual.

570
00:31:56,112 --> 00:31:59,428
- I was told. "Don't ask
any more questions",

571
00:31:59,728 --> 00:32:02,794
and that's kind of
where it ended.

572
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:05,962
- This was not about a bear,

573
00:32:06,064 --> 00:32:08,747
or even about
investigating Gayson.

574
00:32:08,848 --> 00:32:11,303
- You believe they were
covering something up?

575
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:14,604
- It was a distraction, to keep
people from knowing the truth.

576
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:20,167
- Look, no one talks about
what happened that night.

577
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,054
- At this point
you were at DEFCON 2?

578
00:32:23,152 --> 00:32:25,388
- At 1730, the 104th reported
multiple bogies

579
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,047
descending
into Nevada airspace.

580
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:42,190
I got that one on video.

581
00:32:42,287 --> 00:32:44,197
- When they made an abrupt
turn at the south...

582
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:47,374
...law enforcement,
civilians had already seen it.

583
00:32:47,472 --> 00:32:49,708
There was no way
to isolate or contain it.

584
00:32:49,807 --> 00:32:52,196
We couldn't respond in time.
- Major sighting, here!

585
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,638
- Well, our newsroom has been
flooded with calls tonight...

586
00:32:54,736 --> 00:32:56,743
:...from all across
the state of mysterious

587
00:32:56,848 --> 00:32:57,830
flying objects in the sky...

588
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:00,204
:...in what many
are already calling

589
00:33:00,304 --> 00:33:02,475
the largest UFO sighting
in North America.

590
00:33:02,576 --> 00:33:04,398
- There were so many phone calls
coming in

591
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:06,700
from the city and the county,
and people were concerned

592
00:33:06,991 --> 00:33:08,901
that this object
could have been a threat.

593
00:33:09,007 --> 00:33:12,236
It passed over our airport,
it passed over the towers,

594
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:15,564
the buildings, and nobody
was doing anything about it.

595
00:33:15,664 --> 00:33:17,933
- I don't care what nobody's
talking about, man.

596
00:33:18,032 --> 00:33:20,781
Those were aliens and shit,
like E.T., but aliens, man!

597
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:22,668
- After hundreds of panicked
911 calls and reports

598
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:23,782
to local authorities,

599
00:33:23,888 --> 00:33:27,183
airport officials were prompted

600
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,352
to temporarily suspend
flights, as the strange lights

601
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:31,463
crossed over
Sky Harbor air space.

602
00:33:31,568 --> 00:33:33,422
Air traffic controllers
had been notified

603
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,407
by Luke Air Force Base
authorities,

604
00:33:35,504 --> 00:33:39,213
and numerous reports from
nearby residents confirmed

605
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:42,508
the base had scrambled F-16s
shortly after the sightings.

606
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:44,746
- We were tracking 'em
for about 90 minutes

607
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:46,953
coming in from Nevada.

608
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:49,670
As soon as they entered
our air space,

609
00:33:49,775 --> 00:33:51,717
we scrambled two '15's, but...

610
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:56,906
the 104th was already
engaged over that area.

611
00:33:57,007 --> 00:33:58,917
- Engaged?

612
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:04,680
- Yeah, they had encountered
them

613
00:34:04,783 --> 00:34:07,466
over the Barry Goldwater Range
and evaded them into the south

614
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,094
until we could intercept.

615
00:34:09,391 --> 00:34:12,839
That's when operation Snowbird
went into effect.

616
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,367
- Don't worry, baby,
I'll snuggle up to you tonight,

617
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:17,228
keep you warm.
Come on, give me a kiss.

618
00:34:17,327 --> 00:34:20,905
- Quit jerking off
with your toys.

619
00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:22,829
Geek!

620
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,782
- What the fuck?
I mean, look at 'em.

621
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,301
They're all fucking aligned.
- What are you guys lookin' at?

622
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,542
- You're fuckin' retarded,
you know that, right?

623
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:32,681
- Look, look, look, look, look
they're comin' this way.

624
00:34:32,783 --> 00:34:34,954
- Hmm?
- Jesus. That... That's a UFO.

625
00:34:35,248 --> 00:34:36,742
It is not a UF...

626
00:34:36,848 --> 00:34:39,466
those are flares, dude! Come on!
- Flares? From what?

627
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:40,745
- Shh-shh-shh-shh... Listen.

628
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,429
Huh, you hear 'em?
You hear the A-10's?

629
00:34:43,535 --> 00:34:45,226
- Yeah, yeah, you can hear 'em.

630
00:34:45,327 --> 00:34:47,051
- That's what they're from,
you dunce. Hmm?

631
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:48,231
- What are they doing out here?

632
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:50,310
- Must be part of that operation
we saw this morning.

633
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:52,747
- They've been doing maneuvers
over the desert all day.

634
00:34:52,847 --> 00:34:55,782
- Oh, dude! Check it, check it,
look, look, look! You see 'em?

635
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:57,862
The two A-10's?

636
00:34:57,968 --> 00:35:00,651
- Oh, shit. That's not it, man.
- Those are '15's!

637
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:02,345
Oh, shit, those are '15's!

638
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:04,586
Look how fuckin' fast
they're going!

639
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:05,735
Whoohoohoo! Oh, my God!

640
00:35:06,031 --> 00:35:08,398
- Why are they dropping flares,
were they chasing something?

641
00:35:08,495 --> 00:35:11,146
- Maybe it's an exercise
or a... training something.

642
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:12,742
- What? At nine o'clock
at night?

643
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:14,986
- Yeah, I haven't seen '15's
do maneuvers over a city

644
00:35:15,087 --> 00:35:16,614
in, what, like forever?
- Yeah, but why here?

645
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,149
Why aren't they down
by the base?

646
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:20,684
- I don't know! You know
what this means, right?

647
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:22,507
We're fuckin' going up there!
- No!

648
00:35:22,607 --> 00:35:25,357
- We are goin' up there! Come
on, man, let's go! Let's go!

649
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,797
We are doin' this, baby!
- Absolutely not.

650
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:28,070
- What?! Come on...!

651
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:30,510
- We don't know what that is,
we don't even know

652
00:35:30,608 --> 00:35:32,102
where the hell we are
right now.

653
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:33,865
We should just
stay here or go home.

654
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,429
Melissa's fucking
waiting on us anyway!

655
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:37,222
- No, please don't bring
Melissa into this, no...

656
00:35:37,328 --> 00:35:38,375
- Whatever shit
is going on there,

657
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:40,232
we do not need
to be fucking with it.

658
00:35:40,528 --> 00:35:42,022
- You kidding me?
You want to go home, Jake?

659
00:35:42,128 --> 00:35:43,688
Would you quit hiding
from stuff? Please stop

660
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:45,482
being such a fucking pussy,
it breaks my heart!

661
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:46,793
- I'm not being a fucking pussy,

662
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,383
I don't think we should be
fucking around out here, okay?

663
00:35:49,487 --> 00:35:50,862
I just have a bad feeling
about this.

664
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,322
I think we should go home now.
- It's just some planes!

665
00:35:53,423 --> 00:35:55,365
- Yeah, and in two minutes,
they're gonna be gone!

666
00:35:55,472 --> 00:35:57,162
- You're telling me that
those are flares dropped

667
00:35:57,263 --> 00:35:58,987
from fighter jets,
and you want to go closer?

668
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:01,291
What if it's the fucking
Russians, or something!

669
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,239
- It's not the Russians!
What are you talkin' about?!

670
00:36:04,528 --> 00:36:07,081
- Look! I swear I will get you
the best blow job ever,

671
00:36:07,183 --> 00:36:09,834
just please come with me,
alright? We'll go up there,

672
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:11,790
we'll come back down,
it'll take 10 minutes.

673
00:36:11,888 --> 00:36:13,294
You are going, yes?

674
00:36:13,391 --> 00:36:16,687
- Fuckin' a, man--
- Yes! He's going! He's going!

675
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:18,027
And you're going too, baby!

676
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:20,429
Let's do it! This is gonna be
fucking great! Let's go!

677
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:22,120
Let's go, let's go!
- Jesus...

678
00:36:24,303 --> 00:36:25,830
- Lt. Col. James Edwards,

679
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:28,107
now the Assistant Director
of Operations

680
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,793
for the 176th Operations Group
in Maryland,

681
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:33,546
says his squadron
of A-10 Warthogs

682
00:36:33,647 --> 00:36:36,397
was on a training exercise
over the Barry Goldwater Range.

683
00:36:36,496 --> 00:36:38,830
- So you're saying the lights
that people witnessed

684
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,712
were flares?
- Most likely they were

685
00:36:41,008 --> 00:36:42,950
our LUU-2
illumination parachute flares.

686
00:36:43,055 --> 00:36:46,284
- Is that unusual, to drop
flares over a populated area?

687
00:36:46,383 --> 00:36:49,417
- We were miles
from any civilian areas.

688
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:53,191
It was standard procedure
to drop unused ordinance

689
00:36:53,488 --> 00:36:55,015
after a run.

690
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,356
- I still don't know
what it was.

691
00:36:57,455 --> 00:37:00,205
As a pilot and a former
Air Force officer, uh...

692
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:02,857
I can definitively say
that this craft did not resemble

693
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:05,355
any manmade object
that I'd ever seen.

694
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:08,423
And it was certainly not
"high altitude flares",

695
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:12,750
as put out by the, uh... the Air
Force at Luke Air Force base,

696
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:16,230
because I've never seen flares
fly in formation.

697
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:19,081
- There were about five or six
craft, uh...

698
00:37:20,847 --> 00:37:23,815
We were tracking their progress
for about ten more minutes...

699
00:37:25,807 --> 00:37:27,750
And when they passed
over the city,

700
00:37:28,048 --> 00:37:29,957
they broke south for Tucson.

701
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:32,357
- What changed?

702
00:37:33,808 --> 00:37:37,069
- Well, after what happened in,
uh... Belgium and Osaka,

703
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,037
we... we sure as hell weren't
gonna take any chances.

704
00:37:41,488 --> 00:37:43,397
- What kind of chances?

705
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:49,869
- Fuckin' move, let's go!
- Mitch, Mitch. Hold up, man.

706
00:37:49,903 --> 00:37:51,278
- Move it, let's go!

707
00:37:53,968 --> 00:37:55,877
- Are you serious?

708
00:37:57,967 --> 00:37:59,396
See that shit?!

709
00:37:59,503 --> 00:38:00,998
- Let's just turn around.

710
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,774
...freakin' me out.
- ...seen anything like this?

711
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,668
I mean,
what the fuck is going on?

712
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:08,742
- What's that one
behind that one over there?

713
00:38:08,847 --> 00:38:10,702
- I don't know, it's not a '15.

714
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:12,871
- Yeah, no fucking a right,
it's moving too fast.

715
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,142
- They're dumping more flares.

716
00:38:15,247 --> 00:38:17,003
Ugh, let's get
the fuck out of here.

717
00:38:18,928 --> 00:38:21,961
- Two of our F-15's approached
them from the North.

718
00:38:22,063 --> 00:38:24,070
One of our birds
attempted to make contact

719
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,215
with the lead craft,
and the other objects

720
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:28,686
instantly egressed from the AO.

721
00:38:30,448 --> 00:38:32,837
- Flares...
- Okay.

722
00:38:34,927 --> 00:38:37,164
- ...multiple bogies closing in
on your position.

723
00:38:37,264 --> 00:38:38,671
- Check your nine o'clock...

724
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:41,386
- We had an E-3 in the air
covering with FLIR.

725
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,658
We could see them on visual,

726
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:46,023
but they were completely
invisible to radar.

727
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:48,429
- I was passed some information
that said

728
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:50,661
this was operation Snowbird.

729
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:54,728
The information this man
gave me was codenames

730
00:38:54,831 --> 00:38:57,319
and Snowbird was diversion.

731
00:38:58,607 --> 00:39:01,324
- Can you tell us specifically
what operation Snowbird is?

732
00:39:05,487 --> 00:39:08,040
- In the event of a mass
sighting or an engagement

733
00:39:08,143 --> 00:39:09,387
over a civilian populated area,

734
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:12,171
operation Snowbird would deploy
deterrent measures

735
00:39:12,271 --> 00:39:17,192
or diversionary tactics to draw
eyes away from the combat zone.

736
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,397
- A distraction operation?

737
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:21,869
- Yeah.

738
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:24,717
- So when the public saw
the lights over the city

739
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:26,757
they weren't seeing
the actual craft?

740
00:39:26,863 --> 00:39:29,962
- No. No, they were seeing
our flares.

741
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:35,816
- Is it unusual to drop flares
over a populated area?

742
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:37,708
- Well, I've already stated that
we--

743
00:39:37,807 --> 00:39:39,879
- Eh! Look, as Lieutenant
Colonel Jones stated

744
00:39:39,983 --> 00:39:42,830
in his report,
the events of March 13 were

745
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:45,862
a documented training exercise
with the 104th fighter squadron.

746
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,909
- Is it unusual that A-10's
from another base

747
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:49,385
would violate your air space

748
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,145
without first contacting
your flight controller?

749
00:39:51,247 --> 00:39:53,003
- Lt. Col. Jones and his men

750
00:39:53,104 --> 00:39:55,143
were well within their area
of operation.

751
00:39:55,247 --> 00:39:57,102
- And, does this include
operation Snowbird,

752
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,785
as a diversion exercise
over the Estrella Mountains?

753
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:01,959
- Alright, we're going to end
this interview now.

754
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:05,098
- I didn't expect
those questions.

755
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,825
- At, uh, 2200 hours...

756
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,782
they cleared
the E. Mountain line,

757
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:15,662
and that lead craft, uh...

758
00:40:15,759 --> 00:40:17,384
changed trajectory,

759
00:40:17,487 --> 00:40:20,105
and engaged our fighters
head on.

760
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:22,346
- So, what was going through
your mind?

761
00:40:22,447 --> 00:40:25,164
- I had never seen anything move
so fast in my life.

762
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,844
Okay, stay on top of them...

763
00:40:35,407 --> 00:40:37,479
- Everyone defending!

764
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:46,443
...missile launched!

765
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:52,196
- Warning. Warning.
Warning. Warning.

766
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:00,876
- I don't think so, I mean

767
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:03,142
they're not supposed to be able
to move like that.

768
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:05,319
- Whoa! Look, look, look,
look, look!

769
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:09,509
- Oh shit!

770
00:41:09,808 --> 00:41:11,979
- Oh, fuck, what the hell
was that?!

771
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,868
- Jesus Christ!
- What was that?!

772
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:16,618
- Oh, my God, man,
that's a pilot...

773
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,988
- But why did we shoot it down?

774
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:20,843
- Come on, we gotta go.

775
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:26,666
- What're you doing?!
- That's enough, listen, dude...

776
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:27,716
Mitch, get...

777
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:29,547
- Everybody on, everybody on!
Come on, man!

778
00:41:29,647 --> 00:41:31,305
- Goddamn it!

779
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,440
- Where the fuck is it?!

780
00:41:34,543 --> 00:41:36,845
- I think they went this way,
somewhere over here, come on!

781
00:41:36,943 --> 00:41:38,317
- They're looking
in the wrong place!

782
00:41:38,608 --> 00:41:40,200
- Come on!

783
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:43,077
- Do you see it?!

784
00:41:43,183 --> 00:41:45,485
- It's on the mountain there!
- Right over there! Look!

785
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:11,716
- Mitch...

786
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:15,753
- Wait, hang on,
get down, get down.

787
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:17,454
We need to turn around,
right fuckin' now.

788
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:18,631
- Hang on a second.
- No, why...?

789
00:42:18,927 --> 00:42:20,837
- It's a fucking pilot,
we can't leave him.

790
00:42:20,943 --> 00:42:22,318
- Listen to him, man,
he's right.

791
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,902
You've had your fun,
let's get the fuck out of here.

792
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:27,309
- If that's one of ours,
I'm not gonna leave him here!

793
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,093
- "One of ours"?
What are you talking about, dude?

794
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:31,533
If that's one of ours, military,
someone's coming after him.

795
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:33,770
- There's nobody else here!
It's our chance to save him.

796
00:42:33,871 --> 00:42:36,238
Will you just fucking come
with me for one second?!

797
00:42:36,335 --> 00:42:39,597
- We don't know what the hell that is!
- We're just gonna see if he's okay!

798
00:42:39,695 --> 00:42:43,306
If he's fine, we'll go back down,
we'll get some help, alright? It'll be fine!

799
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:45,993
- If who's fine?!
- The fucking pilot, man! God, he needs us!

800
00:42:46,095 --> 00:42:47,208
- Listen to me.
Nobody needs us,

801
00:42:47,311 --> 00:42:49,700
and this is not the time
for you to play hero.

802
00:42:49,807 --> 00:42:51,912
- What're you worried about?
- What am I worried about?!

803
00:42:52,015 --> 00:42:53,957
About him going up there,
getting us all fucking killed,

804
00:42:54,063 --> 00:42:56,070
we shouldn't be here
in the first fucking place.

805
00:42:56,367 --> 00:42:57,644
Listen, Mark is not up there,
okay?

806
00:42:57,743 --> 00:43:00,198
- What the fuck did you say
to me?! Fuck you, dude!

807
00:43:00,303 --> 00:43:01,830
- I'm trying to save
his fucking life!

808
00:43:02,127 --> 00:43:04,615
- You wanna be a fucking baby,
fine! I'm going after him!

809
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:06,312
- You've lost your fuckin' mind!
Go!

810
00:43:06,415 --> 00:43:08,106
- You sack of shit!
Fuck you, Ryan!

811
00:43:08,207 --> 00:43:10,508
- Fuck...
- If he dies, it's on you!

812
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:13,766
- We gotta go, we got--
- Get the fuck off me!

813
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:16,588
- Let's go!
- This is bullshit! Let him go!

814
00:43:16,687 --> 00:43:18,988
- Would you leave up there,
alone? Come on!

815
00:43:19,087 --> 00:43:21,029
- This doesn't make any sense.

816
00:43:21,327 --> 00:43:23,880
- Come on, man...
- Mitch! Mitch!

817
00:43:23,983 --> 00:43:25,706
- Ryan, man! Ryan!

818
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:28,996
Shit!

819
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,429
- They were scared.

820
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:36,902
We... uh.... We're talking
about best trained pilots

821
00:43:37,007 --> 00:43:39,876
in the world, best equipment
in the world, it doesn't matter.

822
00:43:41,647 --> 00:43:44,996
We were not prepared for
anything like this, nobody is.

823
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:48,837
- Can we fucking go now?

824
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:53,000
- Come on, Jake,
a little further, buddy.

825
00:43:57,807 --> 00:43:59,236
- Come on!

826
00:44:02,127 --> 00:44:03,720
- You see this?

827
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,596
- Hey, you good?
- Yeah.

828
00:44:12,687 --> 00:44:14,662
- Mitch--
- Shh! Shut the fuck...!

829
00:44:14,767 --> 00:44:16,174
Dude, come on!

830
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:18,507
- That's gotta be
one of our jets, man.

831
00:44:18,607 --> 00:44:20,909
Did you guys see
an ejection or anything?

832
00:44:21,007 --> 00:44:22,468
- No!
- No, nothing. Can we go now?

833
00:44:22,767 --> 00:44:25,069
- Would you shut the fuck up,
come on!

834
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:26,312
I gotta go up.

835
00:44:26,607 --> 00:44:28,233
- Mitch, no. No, no, no, dude!
- Mitch!

836
00:44:28,527 --> 00:44:30,153
- Fuck. Then stay here!
- That is far enough!

837
00:44:30,447 --> 00:44:31,560
- Mitch!

838
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:40,742
What the fuck is that?!

839
00:44:49,327 --> 00:44:51,782
- There was no heat signature.

840
00:44:51,887 --> 00:44:54,505
Our E-3 controllers were
unable to find the crash site

841
00:44:54,607 --> 00:44:56,101
for 28 minutes.

842
00:44:57,647 --> 00:44:59,883
By the time we did find
their location,

843
00:45:01,647 --> 00:45:03,240
it was too late.

844
00:45:05,231 --> 00:45:08,100
Oh, my God!

845
00:45:08,207 --> 00:45:11,273
- Go! Go! Go!
Go to the bikes!

846
00:45:24,687 --> 00:45:27,076
Come on, come on!

847
00:45:33,327 --> 00:45:35,498
- Shit! Shit! Shit! Mitch!

848
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:37,994
- Come on. If they knew
they were trapped,

849
00:45:38,095 --> 00:45:39,819
wouldn't they have done
something about it?

850
00:45:39,919 --> 00:45:42,669
I mean, this is the
U.S. military for Christ's sake,

851
00:45:42,767 --> 00:45:44,589
they can do anything they want.

852
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:55,403
- Come on, Jake!
- Glenn!

853
00:46:01,327 --> 00:46:03,269
- Mitch! Ryan!

854
00:46:17,967 --> 00:46:19,080
- Jake!

855
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,942
Jake! Jake!

856
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:25,640
- Jake!

857
00:46:27,726 --> 00:46:31,436
- Oh, my God, dude...
His leg is fucked, man! Shit!

858
00:46:31,535 --> 00:46:32,876
- Take it easy.
Jake, listen to me, buddy.

859
00:46:32,974 --> 00:46:34,982
You're gonna be alright, okay?
You're gonna be okay.

860
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:37,221
- Oh, God, Jesus.

861
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:38,853
- I don't know, alright.
I don't know.

862
00:46:39,151 --> 00:46:41,125
- Let's just get him
back on one of the bikes.

863
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,638
- Don't think
that's a good idea!

864
00:46:42,927 --> 00:46:44,356
Nooo!

865
00:46:44,463 --> 00:46:46,470
- Okay...
- What about those things?

866
00:46:46,767 --> 00:46:48,261
I don't know!

867
00:46:52,015 --> 00:46:55,114
- Fuck!
- Come on, Jake, we gotta go, buddy!

868
00:46:55,407 --> 00:46:58,277
This way!

869
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:01,612
Come on, man!

870
00:47:01,711 --> 00:47:04,264
- Come on, Jake. Come on, buddy.
- Guys, this way!

871
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:05,676
Jesus!

872
00:47:05,967 --> 00:47:07,047
- I can't see 'em!

873
00:47:07,151 --> 00:47:09,060
- What the fuck is going on,
Mitch?!

874
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:11,076
- Move! Come on, man!

875
00:47:12,047 --> 00:47:14,316
We gotta go faster!

876
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:16,680
Come on! Come on!

877
00:47:20,847 --> 00:47:22,952
This is the way, guys!
Come on, follow me!

878
00:47:23,247 --> 00:47:25,320
Hey, guys! Over here!

879
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:34,124
Down here! Down here, come on!

880
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:38,275
Come on, let's go.

881
00:47:45,486 --> 00:47:47,428
Oh...
: What are we even doing?

882
00:47:47,535 --> 00:47:49,739
- Shh-shh-shh-shh!
Okay, alright, hold up.

883
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:51,562
Let's stay here for second.

884
00:47:51,663 --> 00:47:54,183
: We never should
have fuckin' come here.

885
00:47:54,287 --> 00:47:57,418
- I know, I'm sorry, buddy.
- We'll never get out of here!

886
00:47:57,518 --> 00:47:59,242
- Listen, man. Just hang in
there, alright?

887
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,863
We're gonna get through this.
I'm sorry, buddy.

888
00:48:01,966 --> 00:48:04,236
We gotta keep moving, though,
okay? Can you walk?

889
00:48:04,527 --> 00:48:06,502
- I don't know, man,
I don't know.

890
00:48:06,606 --> 00:48:07,850
- Jesus. Uh...
Alright, listen...

891
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:11,366
It's either stay, alright?
And wait for the sun.

892
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,787
Or we try for it.
It's up to you.

893
00:48:15,087 --> 00:48:17,062
Shit...

894
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:18,595
- What're we doing here, Mitch?

895
00:48:18,703 --> 00:48:20,612
- Just... let me think
for a second.

896
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:23,049
- I think they gave up.
We can make a run for it!

897
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:24,907
- Shhh, did you see
how many there were?!

898
00:48:25,006 --> 00:48:27,178
- Are you fucking crazy?
They are fucking hunting us!

899
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

900
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
: Okay, we've got four
civilians heading in 0230.
Multiple contacts
North of their position.

901
00:49:20,367 --> 00:49:22,571
- Stop! Stop!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

902
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:24,427
Jesus Christ!

903
00:49:24,526 --> 00:49:25,835
- We gotta go!
Come on! Come on!

904
00:49:26,127 --> 00:49:27,305
- What the fuck
are those things?

905
00:49:27,406 --> 00:49:29,675
- Glenn, come on!
- Over here!

906
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,396
Over here!

907
00:49:36,142 --> 00:49:38,990
- Come on!
- What's that light coming from?

908
00:49:39,087 --> 00:49:41,094
- I don't know,
maybe it's a house.

909
00:49:41,198 --> 00:49:43,467
We gotta go! Go, go, go!
- Come on, Jake!

910
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,663
- Come on, Jake.

911
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:49,287
- Shit! It's the same house
from this morning.

912
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,245
It's the same fuckin' house
from this morning, man!

913
00:49:51,342 --> 00:49:53,546
- I know it is! What else
are we going to do?!

914
00:49:53,647 --> 00:49:55,589
This way, come on!
- Argh!

915
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:57,384
Come on, come on!

916
00:49:57,583 --> 00:49:59,819
You got him?

917
00:50:00,015 --> 00:50:07,914
- Tracking civilians at 0647.

918
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:14,475
- I wish I could share the pain
I live with everyday.

919
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:21,000
The shame I feel when I look
at myself in the mirror.

920
00:50:21,807 --> 00:50:23,946
I've prayed.

921
00:50:24,046 --> 00:50:25,956
Oh, God, I've prayed.

922
00:50:28,207 --> 00:50:31,720
I'm not ready
for the Kingdom of Heaven.

923
00:50:33,646 --> 00:50:38,283
There's only one savior
waiting for me.

924
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:05,003
Hey! Hey!

925
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:11,080
Guys, over here! Come on.

926
00:51:11,182 --> 00:51:14,827
- Mitch, they're close! Come on!
- Come on, hurry up!

927
00:51:14,926 --> 00:51:18,058
- Ah, Jesus, come on!
- They're coming!

928
00:51:24,526 --> 00:51:27,625
- Come on, open the gates!
Open the gates!

929
00:51:27,727 --> 00:51:29,417
- Open the fucking gates!

930
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:35,435
They're right behind us!

931
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:43,941
- I don't wanna die out here.

932
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:45,956
It's open! It's open!

933
00:51:58,126 --> 00:52:00,363
Go! Go!

934
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:03,555
- Get inside! Get inside!

935
00:52:07,566 --> 00:52:10,949
- Help me bar the fuckin' door!
- Ooh, Mitch! Mitch! Mitch!

936
00:52:11,247 --> 00:52:13,386
- Yeah-yeah! I'm coming!

937
00:52:13,486 --> 00:52:15,396
Put this... put this over here!

938
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,066
- See how fast they were moving?

939
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:26,282
- Oh, my God, guys. We have
got to get Jake to a hospital!

940
00:52:26,382 --> 00:52:30,474
- Call my dad, he'll... he'll
know who to call, he's...

941
00:52:30,574 --> 00:52:33,870
Can't find a phone!
Where's the fucking phone! Shit!

942
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:36,749
Mitch!

943
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,992
- We can't stay here.
We gotta find some help.

944
00:52:42,094 --> 00:52:44,429
- Well, listen, whatever took
that thing down, if it's military,

945
00:52:44,527 --> 00:52:46,948
someone's gonna come
looking for it, right? Right?!

946
00:52:49,006 --> 00:52:51,145
- Wanna stay here
and wait for them to get here?

947
00:52:51,247 --> 00:52:53,668
- I mean, what are we going
to do about Jake?

948
00:52:53,775 --> 00:52:54,887
- I don't know, maybe...

949
00:52:54,991 --> 00:52:56,485
we'll just leave him here.

950
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,957
- What?! What the fuck
are you talking about?!

951
00:52:59,247 --> 00:53:01,581
We can't just leave him here!
- I am not staying in here

952
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,467
with those things coming in
to tear us apart!

953
00:53:03,566 --> 00:53:05,389
You understand me?

954
00:53:05,486 --> 00:53:06,501
- Oh, shit!
- Fuck!

955
00:53:06,607 --> 00:53:09,225
Who the fuck is that?!

956
00:53:09,326 --> 00:53:11,236
- Who the fuck is this guy?

957
00:53:15,086 --> 00:53:17,126
- Shit...
- Man, I know we're trespassing here,

958
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:19,719
but we got these things
out there chasing us.

959
00:53:24,718 --> 00:53:27,401
- Listen, man.
We have to find a phone.

960
00:53:27,502 --> 00:53:31,244
- Our friend is hurt real bad.
Please help him. Please. Please!

961
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:40,903
- Hey, look, I think there's
some kind of misunderstanding.

962
00:53:41,006 --> 00:53:42,981
If you could just let us
wait here for a while,

963
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:45,323
we'll stay here until
somebody can come and help us.

964
00:53:47,886 --> 00:53:49,894
Hey...

965
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:55,588
- What the fuck, man?!
- What the fuck did you just do?

966
00:53:55,887 --> 00:53:59,182
Dude, how could you open those gates!

967
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:02,311
- You son of a bitch!
- Oh, my God, dude!

968
00:54:02,607 --> 00:54:04,200
Mitch, Mitch! Mitch!

969
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:07,555
- Come on, we gotta move.
Come on, let's move!

970
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:09,964
We can't stay here!
- Come on, come on, Jake!

971
00:54:33,806 --> 00:54:36,523
- Okay. Okay, okay! Okay, okay.

972
00:54:39,726 --> 00:54:42,574
- Guys. There's a lot of blood,
man,

973
00:54:42,671 --> 00:54:43,947
we gotta stop this bleeding.

974
00:54:44,046 --> 00:54:47,079
- Goddamn it! What the fuck?!

975
00:54:47,182 --> 00:54:48,327
Okay, check the beds.

976
00:54:48,431 --> 00:54:50,765
There's gotta be
something in here.

977
00:54:56,686 --> 00:54:58,825
- Oh, shit!
- Yeah.

978
00:54:58,926 --> 00:55:00,749
- I got two! I got two!
- That'll work.

979
00:55:00,846 --> 00:55:01,894
Yeah.

980
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:04,262
- At least it's something.

981
00:55:04,366 --> 00:55:06,919
- It's better than something.
Here, catch.

982
00:55:12,846 --> 00:55:14,755
Hanging in there, Jakey?

983
00:55:17,806 --> 00:55:19,083
- Mitch...

984
00:55:20,686 --> 00:55:23,239
Mitch, I'm sorry for what I said
about Mark, man.

985
00:55:25,646 --> 00:55:27,556
I didn't mean it, okay?

986
00:55:29,646 --> 00:55:31,402
- Yeah, I know, man.

987
00:55:32,847 --> 00:55:34,123
- And...

988
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:39,054
I'm sorry about Melissa.

989
00:55:46,287 --> 00:55:48,588
I'm sorry I porked your mom.

990
00:55:54,126 --> 00:55:56,941
...but I kinda wish
it was the Russians.

991
00:55:57,038 --> 00:55:59,373
- Easy, man.
Just take it easy, okay?

992
00:55:59,471 --> 00:56:03,148
It's gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

993
00:56:12,686 --> 00:56:14,759
- Jake!
- Oh, my God! Jake!

994
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:19,243
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Jake!

995
00:56:20,366 --> 00:56:21,544
- Oh, my God!

996
00:56:24,046 --> 00:56:26,151
- Then why did the men
return to the house?

997
00:56:27,886 --> 00:56:29,795
- Geographically, it was the
only place within miles of them.

998
00:56:29,902 --> 00:56:31,658
It was the only safe port
in the storm.

999
00:56:31,759 --> 00:56:32,806
- And other than those men,

1000
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:35,245
the public had no idea
what was happening.

1001
00:56:36,366 --> 00:56:37,795
- They were the only ones
up there

1002
00:56:37,902 --> 00:56:40,139
and we couldn't risk anyone
compromising the operation.

1003
00:56:40,238 --> 00:56:42,180
- You got it?
You got it, man?

1004
00:56:42,286 --> 00:56:45,003
- Yes. Yes, I fucking got it!
- Come on!

1005
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:46,214
We got to get 'em.

1006
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:48,390
- No, dude, you have no idea
how many of those things

1007
00:56:48,687 --> 00:56:50,181
are out there!
- But I pushed him here--

1008
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:54,148
Turn the fuckin' light off!

1009
00:56:54,447 --> 00:56:56,748
Shh-shh!

1010
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:58,756
- It's in the house!
- Shut up!

1011
00:57:07,406 --> 00:57:09,162
Shh! Shh-shh!

1012
00:57:16,046 --> 00:57:18,861
Shh-shh! Shh!

1013
00:57:27,118 --> 00:57:29,387
Shh-shh! Shh!

1014
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,535
Turn the power back on!

1015
00:58:06,926 --> 00:58:08,966
I don't.

1016
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,347
- Jesus!
- Motherfucker!

1017
00:58:13,167 --> 00:58:15,533
What are those things?!

1018
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:17,321
What'd they do to Jacob?!

1019
00:58:26,126 --> 00:58:28,995
Tell me! What do they want?!

1020
00:58:31,886 --> 00:58:33,795
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck?

1021
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:40,654
- Once we were able
to mark their position,

1022
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,598
our SAR teams were still
about 15 minutes out.

1023
00:58:43,886 --> 00:58:45,959
You could see the men were
getting ripped apart

1024
00:58:46,062 --> 00:58:47,949
and...

1025
00:58:48,046 --> 00:58:51,275
and we had no choice, we had
to do it, we had to attack.

1026
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Oh, oh, God, they're shelling us, man!
- Who?!
- The military!
- Jake's still out there!

1027
00:59:00,526 --> 00:59:02,119
- They're bombing 'em!

1028
00:59:05,486 --> 00:59:06,696
- Shut up. Shut up!

1029
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:08,997
If you don't fucking help me,
I will end you!

1030
00:59:09,102 --> 00:59:10,760
Where's more ammo?!

1031
00:59:14,766 --> 00:59:16,554
- Watch him.
- No! Mitch!

1032
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:19,785
No! Mitch, come back, man!
- Mitch, wait!

1033
00:59:54,286 --> 00:59:57,799
- Hey...
There's a light up there!

1034
01:00:08,046 --> 01:00:09,540
- Oh, shit!

1035
01:00:09,646 --> 01:00:11,533
- Find something.
Go through this!

1036
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:13,539
- He's got cameras everywhere.

1037
01:00:13,646 --> 01:00:16,995
He's been watching us
the whole fucking time! Shit...

1038
01:00:18,926 --> 01:00:20,552
- There's gotta be something
we can use!

1039
01:00:20,846 --> 01:00:23,148
- Mitch!
- Yeah. Keep it.

1040
01:00:23,246 --> 01:00:24,740
- Okay.

1041
01:00:24,846 --> 01:00:27,628
Shit. They lead us here.
He's helping them!

1042
01:00:27,726 --> 01:00:29,155
- Guys!?

1043
01:00:30,446 --> 01:00:32,039
- That's Jake.

1044
01:00:34,606 --> 01:00:37,704
Oh, shit!
- Hey, hey!

1045
01:00:37,806 --> 01:00:39,399
- Mitch. Mitch!

1046
01:00:41,294 --> 01:00:42,701
- Ryan! Ryan. This is you.

1047
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:45,804
You got my back,
I'm going after Jake.

1048
01:00:47,246 --> 01:00:49,351
Alright, let's go. Come here.

1049
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,785
Come on! Let's move!
- Mitch, wait!

1050
01:01:13,806 --> 01:01:15,944
Mitch?! Ryan?!

1051
01:01:16,046 --> 01:01:18,118
Glenn!

1052
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1053
01:01:53,646 --> 01:01:56,166
- Let him go!

1054
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:07,623
No, n-no, man, please? Please?!

1055
01:02:07,726 --> 01:02:10,922
No-I, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1056
01:02:15,086 --> 01:02:18,348
- You okay? Alright, come on,
get up. Get up.

1057
01:02:18,446 --> 01:02:21,315
Come on. Come on, Ryan,
let's go! Let's roll.

1058
01:02:22,126 --> 01:02:24,908
Glenn, let's go!
- Where the fuck did he go?!

1059
01:02:25,006 --> 01:02:27,624
Come on, let's go!

1060
01:02:27,725 --> 01:02:29,548
Over here!
Glenn, come on, let's go!

1061
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:31,140
- We gotta go!

1062
01:02:50,094 --> 01:02:54,153
- I'm going to go out the front and get Jake.
You two go out the back, get to the ATV's,

1063
01:02:54,446 --> 01:02:56,421
I will meet you there. Okay?
Now, come here, come here.

1064
01:02:56,525 --> 01:02:58,664
Listen. I can do this, alright?

1065
01:02:58,766 --> 01:03:01,548
I got it. I'm way faster without
you two bitches, anyway.

1066
01:03:01,646 --> 01:03:04,428
Alright? First one there,
get to the ATV,

1067
01:03:04,526 --> 01:03:07,144
fuckin' haul ass
and get some help. Okay?

1068
01:03:07,246 --> 01:03:10,475
- Okay, okay.
- We can do this. Let's go.

1069
01:03:10,766 --> 01:03:12,195
- Alright.

1070
01:03:14,286 --> 01:03:15,715
- Mitch!

1071
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:19,144
:...local hostiles
converging on the target.

1072
01:03:19,438 --> 01:03:21,380
- We could see 'em on scope.

1073
01:03:21,485 --> 01:03:23,427
There was nothing else
we could do for 'em.

1074
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:27,693
That was the worst thing
I've ever seen.

1075
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:30,343
:...clear to engage
the target.

1076
01:03:30,446 --> 01:03:32,901
- Roger that.

1077
01:03:33,005 --> 01:03:35,307
- One friendly down, confirm,
we have one friendly down.

1078
01:03:35,406 --> 01:03:36,682
- Okay.

1079
01:03:36,782 --> 01:03:38,921
- Continue engaging.

1080
01:03:42,126 --> 01:03:43,555
- Ryan?!

1081
01:03:44,525 --> 01:03:47,395
Come on! Let's go, come on!

1082
01:03:48,846 --> 01:03:50,755
No...

1083
01:03:54,286 --> 01:03:57,068
It's in the house!
It's in the fuckin' house!

1084
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,238
Ryan!

1085
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:03,238
- Go! Go!

1086
01:04:07,726 --> 01:04:09,482
Glenn! Run! Go!

1087
01:04:13,646 --> 01:04:15,718
Don't fucking stop!

1088
01:04:18,446 --> 01:04:19,940
Oh!

1089
01:04:20,045 --> 01:04:21,572
Let's go! Go!

1090
01:04:29,006 --> 01:04:30,151
- Come on!

1091
01:04:30,446 --> 01:04:33,032
Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

1092
01:04:53,805 --> 01:04:55,693
- They found us!

1093
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:57,546
: We got
two civilian friendlies

1094
01:04:57,645 --> 01:04:58,823
exiting the structure.
- Yeah.

1095
01:04:58,926 --> 01:05:01,381
- Roger that, we got them.
Hold that position!

1096
01:05:04,686 --> 01:05:07,141
- Hey!

1097
01:05:07,245 --> 01:05:09,034
- Hey! Down here!

1098
01:05:09,134 --> 01:05:10,476
: Back and left.
Back and left.

1099
01:05:10,766 --> 01:05:12,905
Alright, hold. Get that ladder
down to them.

1100
01:05:15,086 --> 01:05:17,606
- We got 298-9
about 30 seconds on scene.

1101
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:19,619
- Down here.
- Come on!

1102
01:05:19,725 --> 01:05:22,693
We're getting outta here, Glenn!
- We're down here!

1103
01:05:22,797 --> 01:05:24,204
- Hey!

1104
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:26,759
- Oh, shit!

1105
01:05:43,086 --> 01:05:45,387
- Ryan? Ryan?

1106
01:05:45,485 --> 01:05:47,307
What're you doing?

1107
01:05:47,405 --> 01:05:48,583
- Run.

1108
01:05:48,686 --> 01:05:50,758
Run!

1109
01:05:55,406 --> 01:05:57,959
Ryan!

1110
01:07:07,085 --> 01:07:10,468
No! No!

1111
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1112
01:08:23,406 --> 01:08:26,984
- About two weeks
after the, uh... incident,

1113
01:08:27,085 --> 01:08:29,704
a captain from Davis-Monthan
made overtures toward the press,

1114
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:31,627
apparently he was going
to bring this story

1115
01:08:31,725 --> 01:08:33,481
to their attention.

1116
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:39,751
About 72 hours later they found
he and his A-10 aircraft

1117
01:08:40,046 --> 01:08:42,915
crashed into the side
of a Colorado mountainside.

1118
01:08:44,365 --> 01:08:46,821
Pentagon said it was, uh...

1119
01:08:46,925 --> 01:08:49,795
equipment malfunction
and gross pilot error.

1120
01:08:53,166 --> 01:08:55,075
Nobody came forward after that.

1121
01:09:21,837 --> 01:09:23,746
- Do you believe the men
were taken by aliens?

1122
01:09:25,325 --> 01:09:27,234
- I'm not telling you
what I think.

1123
01:09:28,686 --> 01:09:30,693
I'm telling you what I know.

1124
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1125
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1126
01:11:09,325 --> 01:11:12,042
- He was 28
when they disappeared.

1127
01:11:13,325 --> 01:11:17,635
Glenn would've been
43 years old next month.

1128
01:11:22,957 --> 01:11:24,844
- And the official medical
examiner report

1129
01:11:24,941 --> 01:11:27,625
still lists the incident
as an animal attack?

1130
01:11:33,869 --> 01:11:36,291
- That monster took my son.

1131
01:11:36,397 --> 01:11:38,372
He knew what he did,

1132
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,964
and they're just as guilty
as he is for not telling us.

1133
01:11:45,485 --> 01:11:47,372
- And then it was over.

1134
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,476
They just closed the case.

1135
01:11:50,605 --> 01:11:53,060
It was like
no one would help us,

1136
01:11:53,165 --> 01:11:55,554
or even acknowledge
they existed.

1137
01:11:56,205 --> 01:11:58,344
- Their case was never brought
to my attention,

1138
01:11:58,445 --> 01:12:00,682
and when I asked
about the incident

1139
01:12:00,782 --> 01:12:02,669
I was told
"no more questions".

1140
01:12:02,765 --> 01:12:04,904
- But now I'll ask Officer Stein
and his colleagues

1141
01:12:05,005 --> 01:12:06,663
to escort the accused
into the room

1142
01:12:06,765 --> 01:12:09,034
so that we may all look
upon the guilty party.

1143
01:12:15,149 --> 01:12:17,124
- But the bottom line is,
they lied to us.

1144
01:12:18,445 --> 01:12:20,267
They're trying to hide
the facts

1145
01:12:20,365 --> 01:12:23,016
that fit their version
of what happened.

1146
01:12:23,118 --> 01:12:27,274
- Look, our goals are the same
as the families':

1147
01:12:27,566 --> 01:12:29,704
to find answers.

1148
01:12:29,805 --> 01:12:32,139
Now, as a parent,
I sympathize with them,

1149
01:12:32,429 --> 01:12:34,534
but in this case there's
simply not enough evidence

1150
01:12:34,638 --> 01:12:36,394
that this was anything
but an animal attack

1151
01:12:36,493 --> 01:12:38,665
or some kids
who got caught up in a cult.

1152
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:44,005
- The amateur photographer
was camping in the Estrella

1153
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:47,338
mountain range, south of the
I-10 highway. Along with him,

1154
01:12:47,437 --> 01:12:49,063
Mitch Adams...

1155
01:12:49,165 --> 01:12:51,849
- Anyone with information about
their possible whereabouts

1156
01:12:51,949 --> 01:12:54,983
is encouraged to contact
the Arizona Missing Database

1157
01:12:55,085 --> 01:12:58,663
at www.MaricopaMissing.com

1158
01:12:58,765 --> 01:13:01,253
or call 1-866-2Find-Them,

1159
01:13:01,357 --> 01:13:03,724
and remember,
the call is anonymous.

1160
01:14:25,038 --> 01:14:30,024
- It is 8:16, the night of
March 13th, 1997, and suddenly,

1161
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:32,067
over the skies
of Paulden, Arizona,

1162
01:14:32,366 --> 01:14:36,359
what is described as a giant,
brightly lit boomerang,

1163
01:14:36,461 --> 01:14:40,105
soars through the air
slowly and silently.

1164
01:14:40,205 --> 01:14:43,587
Just 16 minutes later
that same UFO is spotted

1165
01:14:43,886 --> 01:14:45,446
by thousands of people
over the Phoenix area.

1166
01:14:45,549 --> 01:14:46,859
People report seeing it,

1167
01:14:46,957 --> 01:14:49,324
pilots report seeing it
in the air,

1168
01:14:49,421 --> 01:14:52,039
yet military radar screens
pick up nothing.

1169
01:14:54,605 --> 01:14:56,841
- If those boys are dead,

1170
01:14:58,445 --> 01:15:01,162
where the fuck are their bodies?

1171
01:15:03,245 --> 01:15:06,179
Where the fuck...

1172
01:15:06,285 --> 01:15:08,194
are their bodies?!

1173
01:17:06,605 --> 01:17:08,198
Okay.

1174
01:17:13,645 --> 01:17:16,994
Hello.
My name is Walt Gayson.

1175
01:17:18,445 --> 01:17:21,479
And my joyous day
has finally come.

1176
01:17:23,245 --> 01:17:27,239
My brothers and sisters
have all risen above this world

1177
01:17:28,205 --> 01:17:30,594
and left their vehicles behind.

1178
01:17:31,885 --> 01:17:34,984
But today it's my turn

1179
01:17:35,085 --> 01:17:37,354
to follow the Chosen Ones

1180
01:17:37,645 --> 01:17:39,555
to the Kingdom of Heaven.

1181
01:17:50,765 --> 01:17:52,674
It is time.
