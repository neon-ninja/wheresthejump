1
00:01:06,628 --> 00:01:10,462
Evacuations are in progress. All...

2
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:13,128
...martial law.

3
00:01:13,295 --> 00:01:15,545
Evacuations are in progress.

4
00:01:15,712 --> 00:01:19,170
All residents are... to their
designated quarantines.

5
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,087
Martial law...

6
00:01:22,753 --> 00:01:24,503
It's okay, sweetheart.

7
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,337
It's okay.

8
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,212
Please. I need to know
if he's on the other bus.

9
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:41,378
- We can check when we stop, ma'am.
- But my son.

10
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:42,878
Ma'am...

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

12
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:18,211
Alpha One, this is Alpha Two, over.
One, this is Two. Do you copy?

13
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:20,795
Why are we stopped short
at the gate? Over.

14
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:23,295
Alpha One, this is Alpha...

15
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,295
What the fuck?

16
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:29,836
What's happening?
You have to tell us what's happening.

17
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:31,378
Open the door.

18
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:36,378
It's all fine.
Everyone stay in the seat and quiet.

19
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:38,795
Open the door.

20
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,420
And close it behind me.

21
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:45,878
No one gets on or off till I get back.

22
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:22,628
Alpha Two, do you copy?

23
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:27,795
Alpha Two, do you copy?

24
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:32,753
Alpha Two, do you copy?

25
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:57,128
- Open the door.
- Yeah. I don't think that's a good idea.

26
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

27
00:04:23,628 --> 00:04:25,336
Okay. Close the door behind me...

28
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:35,836
Patrick.

29
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,920
We need to protect ourselves.
That soldier out there's got two guns.

30
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:07,253
I don't know.
Maybe we should sit tight, man.

31
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:10,795
I'm going out.

32
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:12,128
You got my back.

33
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:14,045
Come on. Let me go. Quick.

34
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What's happening?

35
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:21,669
No, no, no.

36
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:25,794
Patrick.

37
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:27,669
Emma.

38
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:31,628
Emma.

39
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:33,711
- Emma.
- Stop...

40
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:11,836
It's me, it's me, it's me.

41
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:14,253
Emma.

42
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:15,503
Where's Emma?

43
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

44
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,461
No. No.

45
00:09:07,877 --> 00:09:10,127
No. No.

46
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:12,794
Leave me alone.

47
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,211
No.

48
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:18,502
No.

49
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:20,169
No.

50
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,919
No.

51
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:30,336
Jack. Jack.

52
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:32,336
It's okay. I got her.

53
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,169
It's okay. I got her.

54
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:40,336
You're okay.

55
00:09:40,502 --> 00:09:41,794
- Jack.
- Emma.

56
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:46,211
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

57
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,377
- No, no, no.
- Baby, stop.

58
00:09:49,544 --> 00:09:51,169
- She's bleeding.
- Oh, shit.

59
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:52,794
- What's that?
- I don't know.

60
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,502
It's not hers.

61
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,252
It's not hers.

62
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:44,336
Get away from the window, please.

63
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:47,461
He killed another animal.

64
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:02,502
Time for homework.

65
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:07,961
I can't remember
what real meat tastes like anymore.

66
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:25,169
Photo. Photosynthesis.

67
00:12:25,336 --> 00:12:27,211
- Can you spell it?
- F-O...

68
00:12:27,377 --> 00:12:28,877
F.

69
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:32,960
What other letters make the sound "F"?

70
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,377
- P-H?
- Very good.

71
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:15,794
Patrick Thornton here...

72
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,794
broadcasting out of Harmony on 109.9.

73
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,377
Can anybody read me?

74
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,460
Now, that is a real shame.

75
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:43,460
Because we've got a very special show...

76
00:14:43,627 --> 00:14:46,502
in store for you today on Radio Harmony.

77
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:51,210
Chock-full of contests, interviews...

78
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:54,294
fantastic musical numbers.

79
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,585
So let's begin with today's guests.

80
00:14:58,294 --> 00:15:00,669
How you doing, John Doe?

81
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:04,752
"I'm doing good, Patrick. Really good."

82
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,419
And so tell me, John. Are you happy?

83
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:10,627
"Of course, Patrick. Why wouldn't I be?"

84
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Well, maybe because you haven't talked
to anybody for nine years...

85
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:18,294
besides your stupid dog.

86
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:23,460
All right. Let's get to the weather:
The forecast for tonight is cold.

87
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:25,585
Tomorrow, cold.

88
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:28,627
The day after tomorrow, cold.

89
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:33,460
Next year...

90
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:38,794
Well, let's move on
to the question-and-answer contest.

91
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,169
Now, this first one is easy.

92
00:15:41,335 --> 00:15:45,127
Whoever gets it right
wins an all-expense-paid trip...

93
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:49,169
to the end of the fucking earth.

94
00:15:49,835 --> 00:15:54,960
And the crowd goes crazy
with anticipation.

95
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:57,377
All right. Now, here's the question:

96
00:15:57,544 --> 00:16:00,002
Where the hell is everybody?

97
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:23,127
Good night, Lu.

98
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:54,585
Lu?

99
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,043
You know I don't like it when you go
downstairs without telling me.

100
00:17:00,293 --> 00:17:01,793
I didn't wanna wake you.

101
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,460
Anyway, I'm big now.

102
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,960
There are bedtimes you need to follow.

103
00:17:13,793 --> 00:17:15,293
You'll be big...

104
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,793
when I tell you you're big.

105
00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:34,418
Can I have another cookie?
I'm still hungry.

106
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:36,460
But that was...

107
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:39,293
You're not hungry, you're bored.

108
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:43,793
When you're finished, brush your teeth,
or you won't get any more cookies.

109
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:48,377
- I don't like brushing my teeth. It hurts.
- Because you don't brush your teeth.

110
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,252
No, I don't like brushing my teeth
because it hurts.

111
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:54,127
It hurts because you don't
brush your teeth.

112
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:02,168
Okay...

113
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,502
Yeah. I'm coming.

114
00:18:38,543 --> 00:18:41,252
Hey, doggy. Hey, buddy. Did you miss me?

115
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:42,543
Did you miss me?

116
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,960
I saw a really cool episode yesterday.

117
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:47,460
Ramble asked Mamble out. She said no.

118
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,377
Because he didn't bring her flowers.

119
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:53,960
I'd already seen it,
but it was funnier this time.

120
00:19:03,918 --> 00:19:05,585
Hey, doggy. Did you do this?

121
00:19:05,752 --> 00:19:07,335
Did you dig the hole yourself?

122
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:09,502
Good boy.

123
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:14,043
Now I can give you cookies even better.

124
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,043
Just don't tell Dad.

125
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:18,168
He'll cover it back up.

126
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:24,127
No.

127
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:28,918
Where the hell do you run off to
every morning anyway?

128
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,793
Yeah.

129
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:38,460
Two times five.

130
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,001
Ten.

131
00:19:41,168 --> 00:19:43,626
Five times three.

132
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,585
Fifteen?

133
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,751
Nine times 14.

134
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:53,293
No counting on your fingers.

135
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,960
No counting on your fingers.

136
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:01,001
- Dad, how did you know?
- I know everything.

137
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,376
Well?

138
00:20:05,293 --> 00:20:07,126
You know this.

139
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,293
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

140
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,710
I think it's recess time.

141
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:17,460
Few more minutes.

142
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:24,293
All right.

143
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:33,126
Hey, Dad?

144
00:20:33,293 --> 00:20:34,710
Can I shoot?

145
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:36,918
I already told you no.

146
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:38,793
What?

147
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,126
I said it's not a kiddie game.

148
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,126
Then stop shooting
and come play with me.

149
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:49,501
I'm bored.

150
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:56,668
You don't like playing
with your dollies?

151
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,418
I'm too big to be playing with dolls.

152
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,126
Oh, yeah? Who told you that?

153
00:21:05,126 --> 00:21:06,793
Too big, huh?

154
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,460
What do you wanna play?

155
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:15,918
How about I be the teacher,
and you be my student?

156
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:17,585
Okay.

157
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:24,460
You again, Jack. And you didn't
do your homework this time...

158
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:27,626
because you think you're Mr. Big Shot.

159
00:21:27,793 --> 00:21:30,126
I'm really sorry, ma'am. I'm...

160
00:21:30,293 --> 00:21:33,501
- It won't happen again.
- Dad, do it right. In a kid's voice.

161
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:37,626
I'm sorry, ma'am. It won't happen again.

162
00:21:37,793 --> 00:21:41,626
Dad, I said do it in a kid's voice.
Not a squirrel one.

163
00:21:41,793 --> 00:21:45,960
I ate a squirrel. That's why I sound
like this. I have a squirrel in my tummy.

164
00:21:46,126 --> 00:21:48,668
He'd like some food. He's hungry.
He likes little girls.

165
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:52,210
He wants to eat little girls alive.
I eat everything.

166
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:54,085
Dad...

167
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:06,085
I'm hungry.

168
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:57,376
All done. Face and teeth, Daddy.

169
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:04,834
We should get her new flowers.

170
00:23:09,626 --> 00:23:11,793
- What is it?
- Open it.

171
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:36,126
Cool.

172
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,793
Who's that?

173
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:44,209
That's your mom
when she was really young.

174
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:47,418
All these things were hers.

175
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:56,543
But why are you giving me
all these today?

176
00:23:56,793 --> 00:23:59,043
You don't know what today is?

177
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:02,959
Today...

178
00:24:05,793 --> 00:24:07,959
Is it my birthday already?

179
00:24:09,376 --> 00:24:13,126
Happy birthday, happy birthday

180
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:17,501
Happy birthday to you

181
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:25,543
How about you take it to her?

182
00:24:26,418 --> 00:24:30,959
Because I'm pretty damn sure Jack
wouldn't open the fucking door to me.

183
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:38,876
The last dog alive.

184
00:24:39,043 --> 00:24:41,376
And the stupidest one.

185
00:24:45,793 --> 00:24:48,501
- House.
- No.

186
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:53,709
- Loud.
- Nope.

187
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:56,959
No. I give up.

188
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:58,959
- It's mouse.
- Mouse?

189
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:03,168
- That's wasn't a mouse.
- That was so a mouse.

190
00:25:04,293 --> 00:25:07,126
Before there were lots of kids
at birthdays, right?

191
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:11,043
Absolutely, and you can invite
anybody you want.

192
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,043
They all brought you presents?

193
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:17,501
But is it true...

194
00:25:17,793 --> 00:25:19,751
or just a story?

195
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:22,834
Why would I make something like that up?

196
00:25:23,293 --> 00:25:28,418
I don't know, it's just,
I've never seen any other kids before.

197
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:35,084
Don't even remember ever seeing Mom.

198
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:41,709
Honey, I'm telling you the truth.
And your mom, you knew her.

199
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:43,793
You were just little.

200
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,293
That's why you can't remember.

201
00:25:57,626 --> 00:25:59,793
Now that I'm grown up...

202
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:02,376
you can tell me the truth.

203
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:06,959
Do the monsters really exist?

204
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:11,293
They did.

205
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:16,793
But there are no more left.
They all died from the cold.

206
00:26:18,584 --> 00:26:20,751
I'm cold, though, and I'm not dead.

207
00:26:20,918 --> 00:26:24,001
Well, that's because you're
a very strong young lady.

208
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,668
- And grown-up.
- And... No, not grown-up.

209
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:29,959
- Oh, I'm very grown-up.
- Very grown-up. Grown-ups dance.

210
00:26:30,126 --> 00:26:32,292
Come on, honey. Come on, Lu.

211
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:38,459
Spin.

212
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,959
That's all for today.

213
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:13,834
This is 109.9.

214
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:18,834
Somebody fucking answer me.

215
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:34,292
Hello?

216
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:35,959
Hello, this is...

217
00:27:36,126 --> 00:27:39,459
This is Patrick Thornton in Harmony.

218
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:42,042
I'm 109.9. Do you read me?

219
00:27:43,126 --> 00:27:44,626
Hello?

220
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:46,626
Hello? Do you hear me?

221
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:48,709
Hello?

222
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,167
Do you read me? Hello?

223
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:33,667
Lu?

224
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:50,126
What are you doing under there?

225
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,626
Would you come out here, please?

226
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,459
Lu, come out here.

227
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:56,959
Lu.

228
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:02,209
All right. Move over. I'm coming in.

229
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:07,125
Come on. Scooch over.

230
00:30:11,584 --> 00:30:14,292
Now will you tell me
what you're doing under here?

231
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:20,084
I saw a monster last night.

232
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,959
Out the window.

233
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:28,459
What did it look like?

234
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,084
Like Ramble...

235
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:36,459
but really white instead of Grey.

236
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:41,125
And no hair.

237
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:43,459
Claws too.

238
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,917
Oh, and fangs.

239
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,167
I think.

240
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:50,292
Honey, that was a bad dream.
You were having a nightmare.

241
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:55,792
No. First, I had the nightmare,
then I woke up and saw the monster.

242
00:30:57,042 --> 00:31:00,917
You said so yourself that before,
there were monsters that killed mom.

243
00:31:01,084 --> 00:31:04,292
And all those monsters have died
from the cold.

244
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:07,834
And they didn't look like Ramble.

245
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:12,959
If they all died...

246
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:16,959
then why do you keep
so many locks on the door?

247
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,209
You never let me go out.

248
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:22,792
Not even to get food with you
from the other houses.

249
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,959
Do you wanna go with me
to get some food?

250
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,584
Okay.

251
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:36,250
Okay.

252
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:39,709
Let's go down to the kitchen
and get some food. Come on.

253
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:44,667
Wait, what?

254
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:56,792
Okay, bunny.

255
00:31:56,959 --> 00:32:01,792
I need you to not let anybody but doggy
in this hole. Okay?

256
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:04,375
Thank you.

257
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,792
Come on.

258
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:26,917
So...

259
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:29,500
you're the one.

260
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:36,125
The one responsible
for my dog's daily disappearing act.

261
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:42,334
If you give him too many treats,
he could go blind.

262
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:44,959
The... The dog, he...

263
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:48,459
You can... You can eat
as many cookies as you'd like.

264
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,209
Get away from her.
Don't you look at her.

265
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:54,042
Don't you come near her.
Don't you talk to her.

266
00:32:57,459 --> 00:32:58,667
You shut that dog up...

267
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:01,292
or I swear to God,
I will put a bullet in him.

268
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,125
No, doggy's my friend.

269
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:06,542
Dog. Dog, shut up.

270
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:11,292
Come on.

271
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:00,792
Dog.

272
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:21,125
Jesus, Patrick.
Quit making noise or they'll catch us.

273
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,625
That what you say to Jack?

274
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:29,125
"Don't make too much noise,
or Patrick will catch us"?

275
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:33,125
You and Jack...

276
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:40,750
Dog.

277
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:42,833
Come on.

278
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:01,208
Dog.

279
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,458
Dog, quiet.

280
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

281
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,208
Dog. Dog, run. Run.

282
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:22,917
Dog.

283
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,042
Go, go, go.

284
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:36,833
Come on.

285
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:40,792
Come on, Dog.

286
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,792
Come on, Dog.

287
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:48,958
Run. Come on. Come on.

288
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,041
It's too heavy.

289
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,333
Hold with both hands.

290
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:40,083
This is your sight. Like your finger...

291
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,125
- aim right at the bottle.
- Okay.

292
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:44,500
Put your finger on the trigger.

293
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:46,041
Squeeze it.

294
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:47,958
I can't.

295
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,541
Hold on. Take your finger off.

296
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,750
Okay. Wait.

297
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,958
Okay. Aim at the bottle.

298
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:59,458
Squeeze the trigger.

299
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
A little harder.

300
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:10,125
That was so much fun, Daddy.
Can I do it again?

301
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:11,958
Can I, Daddy? Please?

302
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:09,291
Now, next time, what I want you to do...

303
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,291
You see it?

304
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:19,500
Can I shoot it?

305
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:21,166
How hungry are you?

306
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:27,583
You better do it this time.

307
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:03,833
Stay there.

308
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:25,958
Jack.

309
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,249
Hey.

310
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:32,166
Run, Jack.

311
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:46,958
Lu, are you all right? Look at me.
You okay, baby? Are you hurt?

312
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:54,624
Get in the house.
Get in the house now. Go on.

313
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,541
Get behind the gate.

314
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:13,208
Shoot it.

315
00:41:13,374 --> 00:41:15,499
Lock the gate,
and get in the house. Now.

316
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:21,958
Shoot.

317
00:41:56,374 --> 00:41:57,624
No.

318
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:35,499
- Honey, are you okay?
- Get off me.

319
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:37,416
- No.
- Get off me. Get off me.

320
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:39,708
Honey, calm down. Honey, hey. Listen.

321
00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:41,124
Listen up. Listen to me.

322
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:44,416
Honey. Listen to me.

323
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:49,291
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

324
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:52,166
Lu, honey.

325
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,999
Hey.

326
00:43:08,624 --> 00:43:12,999
What did I tell you
about playing the hero, huh?

327
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:15,208
What did I tell you?

328
00:43:16,624 --> 00:43:17,958
No.

329
00:43:18,124 --> 00:43:19,791
No.

330
00:43:24,374 --> 00:43:25,833
No.

331
00:44:13,957 --> 00:44:16,291
Fuck me.

332
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:37,332
Do it.

333
00:44:38,124 --> 00:44:40,666
Do it, Patrick. Do it.

334
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:44,291
Do it.

335
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:58,249
Hello?

336
00:45:00,374 --> 00:45:01,957
Hello?

337
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:13,957
Hello? Can you read me?

338
00:45:14,124 --> 00:45:15,874
Oh, God.

339
00:45:19,124 --> 00:45:21,624
Can you read me? Are you out there?

340
00:45:25,624 --> 00:45:27,291
Hello?

341
00:45:36,457 --> 00:45:37,749
Yeah. I read you.

342
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:39,832
Oh, thank God.

343
00:45:40,082 --> 00:45:44,124
For a minute there, I dreamt
I'd never made contact with someone.

344
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:46,707
Yeah. Me too.

345
00:45:47,124 --> 00:45:48,957
Well, where are you?

346
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:53,124
In Harmony.

347
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,291
- It's in the...
- I know it.

348
00:45:55,457 --> 00:45:57,457
It's not so far from where we are.

349
00:45:58,166 --> 00:45:59,874
They're back.

350
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:03,957
We thought they were all dead,
but they're...

351
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:07,791
They're back. They infected me.

352
00:46:07,957 --> 00:46:10,124
What? But...

353
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:12,207
You were bitten? When was it?

354
00:46:12,374 --> 00:46:14,082
This morning.

355
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:22,249
Too much time has gone by, you'd be
one of them by now. You're not infected.

356
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:24,249
I'm gonna kill it.

357
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,207
I'm gonna go out there...

358
00:46:29,457 --> 00:46:31,582
and I'm gonna kill that...

359
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:35,374
- That creature, whatever it is. I'm...
- Patrick.

360
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:38,624
That creature isn't responsible
for what happened today.

361
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:41,457
The neighbour could've helped you,
but he didn't.

362
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:44,916
He's got the girl,
and now you've got nothing.

363
00:46:45,624 --> 00:46:47,291
What are you gonna do about it?

364
00:46:51,874 --> 00:46:53,457
What?

365
00:46:55,957 --> 00:46:57,791
Who are you?

366
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,082
You're a liar.

367
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:18,624
Last night you said the neighbour
would turn into a monster...

368
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:21,332
because he got bit. But it's not true.

369
00:47:21,499 --> 00:47:23,416
That's impossible.

370
00:47:23,582 --> 00:47:24,624
That thing...

371
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:28,249
That thing bit him.

372
00:47:38,707 --> 00:47:40,415
Why'd you break my watch, Lu?

373
00:47:40,582 --> 00:47:42,665
So, you wouldn't know what time it is.

374
00:47:42,832 --> 00:47:45,415
That monster was the same one I saw
the other night...

375
00:47:45,582 --> 00:47:47,624
and you didn't believe me.

376
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:52,582
Honey, can we call a truce?

377
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,707
What's a truce?

378
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:01,457
A truce is when you forgive someone
for a little while.

379
00:48:03,332 --> 00:48:06,249
You always liked a second cookie
in the morning.

380
00:48:08,457 --> 00:48:10,874
The second cookie was for doggy.

381
00:48:12,624 --> 00:48:15,040
Honey, please.

382
00:48:16,499 --> 00:48:18,915
What's gonna happen
when you're real old?

383
00:48:19,082 --> 00:48:21,624
Will I have to ask permission
to go out then too?

384
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:23,790
I'm tired of living my life locked up.

385
00:48:23,957 --> 00:48:27,415
I've never been out of this house.
You never let me do anything.

386
00:48:27,582 --> 00:48:29,624
I wanna go pick new flowers for my mom.

387
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,707
- If you're afraid, I'll go myself.
- Can't go out. Can't go outside.

388
00:48:32,874 --> 00:48:34,457
Those things...

389
00:48:34,624 --> 00:48:38,374
I don't know what they are,
but, honey, the monsters are back.

390
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,999
But they're flowers for Mom.

391
00:48:42,665 --> 00:48:44,915
I bet the neighbour would do it.

392
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,540
Are you there, Patrick?

393
00:50:53,957 --> 00:50:55,832
Answer, Patrick.

394
00:50:55,999 --> 00:50:57,707
Who are you?

395
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,123
Patrick, are you there?

396
00:51:03,915 --> 00:51:04,957
Patrick?

397
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:09,915
Who the fuck are you?

398
00:51:10,082 --> 00:51:12,582
Patrick, the time is now.

399
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,582
You got your rifle ready last night.

400
00:51:15,748 --> 00:51:18,290
The decision's been made.

401
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,165
I am not a murderer.

402
00:51:23,332 --> 00:51:25,498
I am not going to kill Jack.

403
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,040
Yes, you are.

404
00:51:27,207 --> 00:51:30,415
Don't you dare turn your back on me.

405
00:51:31,373 --> 00:51:35,498
- Shut up.
- No, you shut up.

406
00:51:40,123 --> 00:51:42,290
Don't make me hurt you.

407
00:51:43,207 --> 00:51:45,457
You had the balls to let Emma die...

408
00:51:45,623 --> 00:51:49,790
and now you feel bad
for that son of a bitch, you piece of shit.

409
00:51:49,957 --> 00:51:52,207
Candy ass.

410
00:51:52,457 --> 00:51:57,623
You don't even have the balls
to shoot a goddamn radio.

411
00:52:02,207 --> 00:52:04,540
What will happen to the girl?

412
00:52:12,957 --> 00:52:15,498
Lu, there are no flowers left.

413
00:52:15,915 --> 00:52:18,082
Then I won't call a truce.

414
00:52:25,832 --> 00:52:28,082
But I found these.

415
00:52:32,707 --> 00:52:35,790
Even better. Now they won't droop.

416
00:52:44,123 --> 00:52:45,623
Thank you.

417
00:53:40,915 --> 00:53:43,082
Thanks for watching, bunny.

418
00:53:45,332 --> 00:53:47,165
I'll be back soon.

419
00:53:47,748 --> 00:53:49,457
Promise.

420
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:18,332
Lu?

421
00:54:20,207 --> 00:54:21,873
Lu?

422
00:54:36,998 --> 00:54:38,498
Lu.

423
00:55:28,373 --> 00:55:29,456
No.

424
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,456
No, no.

425
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:37,040
Wait. Over here. Hey.

426
00:56:14,831 --> 00:56:16,873
Lu, baby?

427
00:56:18,623 --> 00:56:20,456
Oh, honey.

428
00:56:22,081 --> 00:56:23,790
Look at me, baby. Look at me.

429
00:57:01,831 --> 00:57:03,290
Lu?

430
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:09,123
Lu?

431
00:57:13,623 --> 00:57:14,665
Lu?

432
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

433
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:39,873
Lu?

434
00:57:54,915 --> 00:57:57,248
Where the hell you going
this time of night?

435
00:58:09,081 --> 00:58:13,539
It's the creature that attacked you.

436
00:58:16,123 --> 00:58:18,123
Think there'll be more?

437
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:19,414
Who are you?

438
00:58:19,581 --> 00:58:21,789
I've been keeping watch with binoculars.

439
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:24,456
- What are you doing?
- There's no sign of them.

440
00:58:25,456 --> 00:58:29,123
Check this out. Thought the fucker
would bleed out and die.

441
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:31,331
Tell me where Lu is, Patrick.

442
00:58:31,498 --> 00:58:35,623
Fucking sealed up the wounds
in just a few hours.

443
00:58:36,123 --> 00:58:39,123
We thought they were dying,
but they're evolving.

444
00:58:39,289 --> 00:58:41,623
They adapted to their environment.

445
00:58:43,831 --> 00:58:45,456
Teeth.

446
00:58:45,623 --> 00:58:46,998
Claws.

447
00:58:47,164 --> 00:58:49,248
Hard skin for resisting cold.

448
00:58:49,414 --> 00:58:51,623
Evolution like that
takes millions of years.

449
00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:52,998
It took this thing nine.

450
00:58:53,164 --> 00:58:55,248
- What happened to Lu?
- It's not all bad.

451
00:58:55,414 --> 00:58:59,248
Neither one of us got infected.
The contagious strain is gone.

452
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:01,914
Gives us a fighting chance, right?

453
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:04,706
Totally blind.

454
00:59:04,873 --> 00:59:08,539
Locate their prey by sound alone.
Don't know how many are out there.

455
00:59:08,706 --> 00:59:11,456
- We're gonna have to be ready.
- What happened to Lu?

456
00:59:12,206 --> 00:59:15,081
How long before this thing
starves to death?

457
00:59:15,248 --> 00:59:18,748
Couple of weeks, a month.
These fuckers are tougher than the first.

458
00:59:18,914 --> 00:59:20,664
Where's Lu, Patrick?

459
00:59:21,914 --> 00:59:22,956
Daddy?

460
00:59:31,164 --> 00:59:33,914
- How did you...? You okay, Lu?
- I'm sorry.

461
00:59:34,081 --> 00:59:36,289
- It's okay, baby.
- Patrick took care of me.

462
00:59:36,456 --> 00:59:39,123
- It's okay. It's okay, baby.
- I'm fine.

463
00:59:39,289 --> 00:59:42,206
- Are you hurt? Let me look at you.
- I'm... I'm okay.

464
00:59:42,373 --> 00:59:44,373
- It's okay, baby.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

465
00:59:46,081 --> 00:59:48,289
Are you cold? Are you hungry?

466
00:59:54,373 --> 00:59:55,789
Patrick?

467
00:59:55,956 --> 00:59:57,664
Are you there?

468
00:59:58,289 --> 00:59:59,831
Patrick.

469
01:00:02,414 --> 01:00:04,039
Patrick.

470
01:00:05,206 --> 01:00:07,623
Listen to me. You...

471
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,664
Hello?

472
01:00:29,581 --> 01:00:31,248
Hello?

473
01:00:31,414 --> 01:00:32,831
Neighbour Patrick?

474
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:36,498
Hello?

475
01:00:37,331 --> 01:00:38,498
Neighbour Patrick?

476
01:00:38,664 --> 01:00:42,456
- Yes?
- Dad. Hey, he answered. Come on.

477
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:45,498
I wanted to invite you over
for dinner tomorrow night.

478
01:00:45,664 --> 01:00:47,748
I mean, if you can, of course.

479
01:00:48,581 --> 01:00:50,623
Can you, Neighbour Patrick?

480
01:00:52,748 --> 01:00:54,873
Yes, Lu. That...

481
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:57,623
I would like that very much.

482
01:00:58,373 --> 01:01:00,498
What time should I come?

483
01:01:01,164 --> 01:01:03,289
How about after my cartoon?

484
01:01:06,081 --> 01:01:08,581
Okay, Lu. I will... I will see you then.

485
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,914
I promise. Okay.

486
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:12,289
Bye, Neighbour Patrick.

487
01:01:35,789 --> 01:01:37,622
Christ.

488
01:01:58,122 --> 01:02:00,581
I didn't know what to bring, so...

489
01:02:04,622 --> 01:02:06,956
You don't drink anymore, do you?

490
01:02:09,497 --> 01:02:11,164
Me either.

491
01:02:18,706 --> 01:02:20,706
Lu, come on down.

492
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:32,539
This is yours.

493
01:02:32,706 --> 01:02:34,122
That's a...

494
01:02:34,289 --> 01:02:37,706
- It's a gift for Lu.
- I figured.

495
01:02:37,956 --> 01:02:41,247
What I mean is,
I don't play with these things.

496
01:02:43,622 --> 01:02:45,622
Hi, Neighbour Pat...

497
01:02:49,122 --> 01:02:50,164
Neighbour?

498
01:03:04,831 --> 01:03:06,456
- Aren't those fancy.
- I know.

499
01:03:06,622 --> 01:03:09,997
They're like my mom's,
but without the holes.

500
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,956
It's for your birthday.

501
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:16,456
Look, Dad. It's the one I wanted.

502
01:03:16,622 --> 01:03:19,664
I thought you were getting too old
to play with dolls.

503
01:03:24,872 --> 01:03:27,414
How'd you know it was the dolly
I liked the best?

504
01:03:27,581 --> 01:03:29,039
I just figured.

505
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:31,706
I sure liked them when I was a kid.

506
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,372
Okay. So be honest.

507
01:03:34,539 --> 01:03:36,872
What else did you like
when you were a kid?

508
01:03:39,747 --> 01:03:41,581
Lots of stuff.

509
01:03:41,872 --> 01:03:43,706
Toy soldiers.

510
01:03:44,206 --> 01:03:46,206
I had a whole bucket of them.

511
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:51,247
And then robots like Mazinger.

512
01:03:51,789 --> 01:03:55,622
But more than anything,
playing hockey with my buddies.

513
01:03:55,789 --> 01:03:57,956
You were a lucky duck.

514
01:03:58,122 --> 01:04:00,831
All I get to play with is my dolls.

515
01:04:02,997 --> 01:04:05,622
There's gotta be a kid or two
out there somewhere.

516
01:04:05,789 --> 01:04:10,039
- There's gotta be someone somewhere.
- My dad says there's not any.

517
01:04:15,622 --> 01:04:18,081
Are you scared of the monsters?

518
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:22,831
Of course he's scared of the monsters.

519
01:04:23,122 --> 01:04:25,664
That's why he protects himself.

520
01:04:26,914 --> 01:04:30,289
And we'll be safe
as long as we protect ourselves.

521
01:04:30,456 --> 01:04:32,914
Yeah, but he's braver.

522
01:04:34,831 --> 01:04:39,081
Now that you two are friends, you can go
hunt animals with my dad, right?

523
01:04:39,247 --> 01:04:41,206
So we can have real food more often.

524
01:04:41,372 --> 01:04:44,122
I think that's a good idea.

525
01:04:44,289 --> 01:04:45,747
I can help your dad hunt...

526
01:04:45,914 --> 01:04:48,122
and he can help me go get ammunition...

527
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:51,622
and other supplies in the store.
What do you think?

528
01:04:51,789 --> 01:04:54,664
I think you don't need my dad's help
to go into town.

529
01:04:59,247 --> 01:05:02,580
You, when you were a kid,
did you know how to add and subtract?

530
01:05:02,747 --> 01:05:07,914
Well, not much.
I tell you what, not much now neither.

531
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,580
Well, I do. My dad taught me.

532
01:05:10,747 --> 01:05:13,039
Watch. Three plus two is five.

533
01:05:13,205 --> 01:05:14,789
Six plus one is seven.

534
01:05:14,955 --> 01:05:17,455
Eight plus four is...?
Come on. It's easy.

535
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,205
No counting on your fingers.

536
01:05:19,372 --> 01:05:20,872
That's cheating.

537
01:05:21,289 --> 01:05:23,789
It's 12, Neighbour Patrick, 12.

538
01:05:23,955 --> 01:05:27,289
I'm glad to know
your dad is good for something.

539
01:05:29,664 --> 01:05:32,789
What about geography?
Did you know about geography?

540
01:05:33,205 --> 01:05:35,997
Let's see. In what country
is the Great Wall of China?

541
01:05:36,164 --> 01:05:37,997
Oh, gosh.

542
01:05:38,747 --> 01:05:41,539
- Mexico.
- Nope. China.

543
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:43,080
Do you know what language they speak?

544
01:05:43,247 --> 01:05:44,455
Chinese.

545
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:46,289
Very good.

546
01:05:46,455 --> 01:05:49,122
- Do you know what the population is?
- Right now?

547
01:05:56,289 --> 01:05:57,789
What is it?

548
01:05:57,997 --> 01:05:59,830
What's so funny?

549
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:01,830
Why are you laughing?

550
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:04,164
Oh, shit.

551
01:06:04,664 --> 01:06:08,164
Dad, he said a swear word.
If you swear, people think badly of you.

552
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:10,539
- I know. I know.
- Right, Dad?

553
01:06:10,705 --> 01:06:12,205
- I know.
- They will.

554
01:06:12,372 --> 01:06:14,622
It's important
what people think about us.

555
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:19,039
Yeah. Well, especially the Chinese.
Goddamn Chine...

556
01:06:20,705 --> 01:06:24,039
And then E.T.'s heart
started to beat again.

557
01:06:27,789 --> 01:06:30,080
And the plant
that looked like it was dead...

558
01:06:30,247 --> 01:06:32,455
came back to life.

559
01:06:33,914 --> 01:06:36,247
That's a nice story.

560
01:06:38,497 --> 01:06:41,955
Meanwhile, Elliott and his friends...

561
01:06:42,122 --> 01:06:44,580
planned E.T.'s rescue.

562
01:06:50,122 --> 01:06:52,455
And she's out like a light.

563
01:06:54,664 --> 01:06:57,580
- Should I take her up?
- I'll handle it.

564
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:06,289
Another night where she goes to sleep
without brushing her teeth.

565
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:08,455
Not a tragedy.

566
01:07:09,164 --> 01:07:11,914
I don't like it when she disobeys.

567
01:07:13,289 --> 01:07:16,372
It's normal. I'm sure you were
rebellious at her age too.

568
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:19,205
It'd be normal
if we were living in a normal world.

569
01:07:19,372 --> 01:07:21,455
Disobeying is dangerous here.

570
01:07:21,622 --> 01:07:23,747
She's a lot like her mother.

571
01:07:24,455 --> 01:07:26,914
She has nothing of her father in her.

572
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:42,372
I'm sorry about your dog, Patrick.

573
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:45,455
- I don't know what came over me.
- It's all right.

574
01:07:46,289 --> 01:07:51,122
I know what it's like
to have weird things come over you.

575
01:07:52,372 --> 01:07:54,455
These things are back.

576
01:07:57,872 --> 01:08:02,372
I haven't forgotten what happened
or what you did.

577
01:08:03,414 --> 01:08:05,872
But I can't do this alone. Not with Lu.

578
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:07,872
You can count on me.

579
01:08:08,497 --> 01:08:10,205
For anything.

580
01:08:11,539 --> 01:08:14,122
That truck we were
gonna take back before Emma...

581
01:08:16,455 --> 01:08:18,289
I think I can get it working.

582
01:08:20,539 --> 01:08:21,914
What?

583
01:08:22,914 --> 01:08:26,663
- We're not going anywhere.
- What, are you planning...

584
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:29,955
on staying here
and waiting for more to come?

585
01:08:32,455 --> 01:08:34,372
What makes you think more are coming?

586
01:08:34,538 --> 01:08:36,288
The fuck are you saying?

587
01:08:36,455 --> 01:08:37,955
They're coming.

588
01:08:38,122 --> 01:08:41,913
If it's not today, it'll be tomorrow
or next week, but they're back.

589
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,372
Shit. You're worried
about her brushing her teeth...

590
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:48,622
instead of her living her life
cooped up in this prison.

591
01:08:48,788 --> 01:08:50,497
There is no future here, Jack.

592
01:08:50,663 --> 01:08:53,622
You lower your voice,
or you will wake her up.

593
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:56,955
We are safe here.

594
01:08:57,955 --> 01:09:00,788
We can protect ourselves here.

595
01:09:01,163 --> 01:09:03,288
We have no idea
what's on the other side.

596
01:09:03,455 --> 01:09:06,288
That's the problem, Jack.
We don't know shit.

597
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:09,872
You have been so hell-bent
on surviving...

598
01:09:10,038 --> 01:09:13,122
that you have forgotten how to live.

599
01:09:13,288 --> 01:09:16,872
Oh, if you're so damn sure,
why the hell haven't you left already?

600
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:28,830
This dinner was a bad idea.

601
01:09:29,122 --> 01:09:30,955
This was her thing.

602
01:09:37,497 --> 01:09:39,080
Go.

603
01:09:39,997 --> 01:09:42,788
I'm grateful for how you raised her.

604
01:09:43,663 --> 01:09:46,247
- Emma would also...
- No. No.

605
01:09:46,413 --> 01:09:47,913
Don't you talk about Emma.

606
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,122
Not in this house.

607
01:09:50,913 --> 01:09:52,455
I'm sorry.

608
01:09:54,247 --> 01:09:57,038
What are you actually sorry about?

609
01:09:59,997 --> 01:10:01,830
Just go.

610
01:10:23,622 --> 01:10:25,455
What did you do?

611
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:26,872
Emma's...

612
01:10:28,997 --> 01:10:31,038
Do you know what you've done?

613
01:10:31,205 --> 01:10:34,372
The infected are all gone.
They're not...

614
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:36,580
Drunk son of a bitch.

615
01:10:36,747 --> 01:10:39,080
Fuck off.

616
01:10:40,705 --> 01:10:43,122
It's okay. It's okay.

617
01:10:45,163 --> 01:10:46,538
Where is she?

618
01:10:47,622 --> 01:10:49,872
- What?
- Emma. Where is she?

619
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,413
You fucking killed her.

620
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:58,955
Fuck.

621
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:01,163
Fuck you.

622
01:11:08,705 --> 01:11:11,038
You're no longer her father.

623
01:11:42,038 --> 01:11:43,413
Dad.

624
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:44,913
What?

625
01:11:46,122 --> 01:11:48,622
Lu, what is it? What?

626
01:11:51,122 --> 01:11:53,622
Baby, you were having a bad dream.

627
01:11:54,497 --> 01:11:56,163
Hey. It's okay.

628
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:58,830
The monsters can't hurt you anymore.

629
01:12:00,371 --> 01:12:01,413
I...

630
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:05,121
I didn't dream about the monster.

631
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:08,163
You died, and I was left here all alone.

632
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:10,121
I don't wanna be alone, Daddy.

633
01:12:10,288 --> 01:12:12,788
- I thought I was big, but I'm not.
- It's okay.

634
01:12:12,955 --> 01:12:15,830
- I'm not. I'm not.
- Okay, okay, okay.

635
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:41,871
You got room for two more?

636
01:13:03,205 --> 01:13:05,371
Daddy. Dad.

637
01:13:07,955 --> 01:13:09,996
Dad, do you see this?

638
01:13:10,955 --> 01:13:15,163
Look, Neighbour Patrick. Look.
Look at all those trees. See this?

639
01:13:15,955 --> 01:13:18,121
Come on. Look.

640
01:13:39,955 --> 01:13:41,955
Lu, stay close.

641
01:13:45,455 --> 01:13:48,038
Lu needs a father, not a drunk.

642
01:13:48,205 --> 01:13:50,913
You... You and Jack...

643
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,705
Patrick.

644
01:14:30,288 --> 01:14:33,121
Is this where you got the dolls from TV?

645
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:36,288
There's only one way to find out.

646
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:03,871
Jack, give me a hand.

647
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:23,746
Lu?

648
01:15:29,621 --> 01:15:31,121
Lu?

649
01:15:52,913 --> 01:15:55,246
Lu, wait for me.

650
01:16:00,746 --> 01:16:02,246
Dad.

651
01:16:03,038 --> 01:16:05,288
I think there's something out there.

652
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:37,913
Are you okay?

653
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:51,038
Hey.

654
01:16:52,329 --> 01:16:54,663
No. No. No.

655
01:16:54,829 --> 01:16:56,954
Get in the truck. Get in the truck.

656
01:16:57,288 --> 01:16:58,788
It's okay.

657
01:17:00,454 --> 01:17:02,621
Calm the fuck down. It's okay.

658
01:17:02,788 --> 01:17:05,329
It's okay. It's okay.

659
01:17:06,621 --> 01:17:08,121
She's in shock.

660
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:25,454
Her clothes are soaking wet.

661
01:17:35,829 --> 01:17:37,163
- All right.
- Yeah.

662
01:17:37,329 --> 01:17:38,788
Come on.

663
01:17:40,913 --> 01:17:43,038
Sweetie, go downstairs.

664
01:17:43,663 --> 01:17:47,329
- But I don't wanna be alone.
- Go downstairs now. Do not disobey me.

665
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,954
Go.

666
01:18:23,913 --> 01:18:26,246
Is that woman gonna die?

667
01:18:27,496 --> 01:18:28,538
No.

668
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:33,371
No, she just got very cold,
and that made her sick.

669
01:18:33,538 --> 01:18:34,954
She's gonna be okay.

670
01:18:36,746 --> 01:18:41,204
- So there are other people in the world?
- Yeah. It looks that way.

671
01:18:41,954 --> 01:18:43,788
Kids too?

672
01:18:44,371 --> 01:18:46,038
I don't know.

673
01:18:47,163 --> 01:18:50,954
We could ask her if she gets better.

674
01:18:51,121 --> 01:18:53,704
Now, that sounds like a good idea.

675
01:19:00,704 --> 01:19:03,037
Did you like my mom too?

676
01:19:08,996 --> 01:19:11,162
It's just
you have so many pictures of her...

677
01:19:11,329 --> 01:19:12,787
up in your room.

678
01:19:13,037 --> 01:19:14,954
We don't even have that many at home.

679
01:19:20,787 --> 01:19:23,871
I think that's why you and my daddy
keep fighting.

680
01:19:25,037 --> 01:19:26,954
It is, isn't it?

681
01:19:30,371 --> 01:19:31,996
You are a...

682
01:19:32,662 --> 01:19:35,079
A very clever girl.

683
01:19:41,412 --> 01:19:43,746
And when my mom chose my dad...

684
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:46,371
I bet you were pretty sad.

685
01:19:50,454 --> 01:19:53,121
But weren't there
other pretty girls for you?

686
01:19:56,037 --> 01:19:58,371
None as pretty as your mother.

687
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:10,204
She's stabilised...

688
01:20:10,371 --> 01:20:12,787
but she is running a fever.

689
01:20:14,412 --> 01:20:15,871
It's hot.

690
01:20:16,037 --> 01:20:18,704
I'm gonna go out and check the fence.

691
01:20:23,621 --> 01:20:25,787
You have to do what I tell you.

692
01:20:27,454 --> 01:20:28,871
Please.

693
01:20:59,787 --> 01:21:00,996
She was delirious.

694
01:21:01,162 --> 01:21:03,496
Said dozens of creatures attacked them.

695
01:21:05,954 --> 01:21:07,787
See anything?

696
01:21:09,287 --> 01:21:11,537
I hadn't noticed that for so long.

697
01:21:11,704 --> 01:21:13,037
What?

698
01:21:47,579 --> 01:21:49,246
It's okay.

699
01:21:55,954 --> 01:21:59,162
We were shut up in our house...

700
01:21:59,329 --> 01:22:02,996
for over a year.

701
01:22:03,621 --> 01:22:09,954
My parents, my brothers and I,
we just stayed there...

702
01:22:10,121 --> 01:22:13,496
because of what we heard on the radio
before the blackout.

703
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,496
Then what happened?

704
01:22:18,579 --> 01:22:20,037
Then...

705
01:22:20,579 --> 01:22:25,537
Then we left our house
and headed north...

706
01:22:25,704 --> 01:22:30,454
in just abandoned cars
we found along the way.

707
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:32,079
And...

708
01:22:32,454 --> 01:22:35,162
living in all kinds of places.

709
01:22:36,829 --> 01:22:40,787
And we found little cells of survivors.

710
01:22:40,954 --> 01:22:42,662
People like you all.

711
01:22:42,829 --> 01:22:47,412
And I met a guy
in one of these groups...

712
01:22:47,579 --> 01:22:51,537
and I got pregnant.

713
01:22:53,995 --> 01:22:58,120
Although, he never had
the chance to know it.

714
01:23:00,495 --> 01:23:01,995
And...

715
01:23:05,537 --> 01:23:08,829
about a few weeks ago, we...

716
01:23:09,287 --> 01:23:11,620
We hooked up
with about a dozen others...

717
01:23:11,787 --> 01:23:13,995
and created a three-car convoy.

718
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:18,204
We heard a radio broadcast
out of this valley...

719
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:23,829
and thought
that maybe things weren't so bad here.

720
01:23:27,204 --> 01:23:29,912
Why did you leave your house?

721
01:23:34,912 --> 01:23:36,912
Because...

722
01:23:38,162 --> 01:23:40,620
that was no longer living.

723
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:45,620
I mean, we're human beings.

724
01:23:48,162 --> 01:23:50,662
What about you?
How long have you been here?

725
01:23:53,704 --> 01:23:55,954
Do you know how to braid?

726
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,287
Lu.

727
01:23:57,454 --> 01:23:58,954
Yeah.

728
01:24:09,995 --> 01:24:12,120
I'd like to go to China.

729
01:24:12,537 --> 01:24:14,954
It's really, really big.

730
01:24:15,454 --> 01:24:16,912
Well...

731
01:24:17,454 --> 01:24:19,870
I'd like to go to China too.

732
01:24:21,204 --> 01:24:25,204
Yeah. They say
it's a very beautiful place.

733
01:24:28,287 --> 01:24:30,037
What is it?

734
01:24:33,245 --> 01:24:36,037
Is there really a baby in there?

735
01:24:38,454 --> 01:24:39,954
Yeah.

736
01:24:40,454 --> 01:24:42,037
There is.

737
01:24:42,454 --> 01:24:43,870
And...

738
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:46,245
well, you know, when...

739
01:24:46,412 --> 01:24:50,370
When he's born,
you'll have to help take care of him.

740
01:24:50,787 --> 01:24:52,454
- Would you like that?
- Yes.

741
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:57,287
You'll be able to play together
and be friends.

742
01:24:58,954 --> 01:25:00,954
They're here. They're here.

743
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:04,537
- No. No, we captured one. It's harmless.
- What?

744
01:25:04,704 --> 01:25:07,787
Yeah. It's harmless. I'm telling you.
Completely.

745
01:25:22,162 --> 01:25:23,537
Hey.

746
01:25:38,287 --> 01:25:41,412
That's how they fucking call
to each other.

747
01:26:05,245 --> 01:26:07,578
What the hell is going on?

748
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:10,120
Now, we're all gonna die.

749
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:15,578
No one is gonna die.

750
01:27:04,745 --> 01:27:06,578
Hey, you.

751
01:27:08,245 --> 01:27:12,703
- That's a nice doll. What's his name?
- Lu doesn't deserve this.

752
01:27:14,078 --> 01:27:15,745
I call him Randy.

753
01:27:15,912 --> 01:27:17,370
Look.

754
01:27:18,453 --> 01:27:20,287
I'm sorry.

755
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:24,412
Sorry for everything that's happened.

756
01:27:25,995 --> 01:27:28,828
It's not my forgiveness you need.

757
01:27:56,787 --> 01:27:57,953
What...?

758
01:28:36,412 --> 01:28:39,620
Lu, sweetie, for once in your life,
just obey Daddy.

759
01:28:40,037 --> 01:28:42,287
I need you to go downstairs.

760
01:28:42,787 --> 01:28:45,120
Listen to me. Lu, listen to me.

761
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:48,287
Daddy needs to help
get the monsters out of the house.

762
01:28:48,453 --> 01:28:50,870
I can't do that
if I don't know you're safe.

763
01:28:51,037 --> 01:28:53,787
The windows, they're small,
monsters cannot get in.

764
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:55,453
Listen, they won't get in.

765
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:58,328
- Gonna shut the door, walk downstairs.
- Daddy.

766
01:28:58,703 --> 01:29:02,120
And no matter what happens,
you don't make a sound. All right?

767
01:29:03,703 --> 01:29:06,620
You understand?
That's right, sweetheart. That's right.

768
01:29:06,787 --> 01:29:10,037
That way they can't hear you. Okay.
So, you just...

769
01:29:10,203 --> 01:29:14,870
And when this is all over,
Daddy is gonna open the door. Okay?

770
01:29:15,037 --> 01:29:16,870
You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

771
01:29:17,037 --> 01:29:18,495
No.

772
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

773
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

774
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

775
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

776
01:34:13,286 --> 01:34:14,786
Patrick.

777
01:34:17,786 --> 01:34:20,286
I think they're inside the walls.

778
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:10,536
Lu? Honey, are you there?

779
01:35:11,286 --> 01:35:12,786
Lu?

780
01:36:16,786 --> 01:36:18,411
Drop dead.

781
01:37:02,786 --> 01:37:04,286
Lu.

782
01:37:10,369 --> 01:37:12,536
I don't like the basement.

783
01:37:13,952 --> 01:37:16,744
There's a monster,
and he tried to hurt me.

784
01:37:17,161 --> 01:37:18,452
That's why I need you...

785
01:37:18,619 --> 01:37:20,661
- to stay right here.
- No.

786
01:37:20,827 --> 01:37:22,286
Everybody can see each other right here.

787
01:37:22,452 --> 01:37:23,911
Okay? You'll be safe here.

788
01:37:24,077 --> 01:37:25,286
Where's my dad?

789
01:37:25,452 --> 01:37:26,786
Your dad...

790
01:37:26,952 --> 01:37:30,327
Your dad is upstairs,
and he's gonna be down any minute.

791
01:37:30,494 --> 01:37:33,202
I need you to stay here.
Stay away from the doors...

792
01:37:33,369 --> 01:37:36,411
and the windows,
and everything's gonna be okay.

793
01:37:46,661 --> 01:37:48,494
Hello? Do you read me?

794
01:37:49,036 --> 01:37:54,369
We're broadcasting from Spring Falls.
This is not a pre-recorded message.

795
01:38:32,244 --> 01:38:34,952
Lu? Lu, what are you doing here?
Are you hurt?

796
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:37,452
- Dad. Dad.
- Now stay here. Don't move.

797
01:38:56,119 --> 01:38:59,536
- More fuel?
- Yeah, but the generator's out too far.

798
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,786
More ammo?

799
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Not enough.

800
01:39:36,161 --> 01:39:37,619
Shit.

801
01:39:38,786 --> 01:39:40,952
Give me some fucking light.

802
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:42,619
Right here.

803
01:39:43,577 --> 01:39:44,619
Hurry.

804
01:40:18,952 --> 01:40:21,119
I won't let them hurt her.

805
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:25,785
- Dad.
- It's okay, baby.

806
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:30,369
Baby, listen to me. I want you
to close your eyes and think of Mom.

807
01:40:30,535 --> 01:40:32,410
- Dad.
- Close your eyes, baby.

808
01:40:32,577 --> 01:40:35,785
Close your eyes and think of Mom.
And when you see her...

809
01:40:35,952 --> 01:40:37,952
- the monsters will be gone.
- Dad.

810
01:40:38,119 --> 01:40:41,660
And when you see her,
the monsters are gone.

811
01:40:43,452 --> 01:40:46,619
And when you see her,
the monsters are gone.

812
01:40:46,785 --> 01:40:50,952
No, Dad. They said you have
to shoot them in the head to kill them.

813
01:40:51,452 --> 01:40:53,035
Who?

814
01:40:54,369 --> 01:40:55,535
The woman on the radio.

815
01:40:55,702 --> 01:40:57,952
They said it
before everything turned off.

816
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:01,369
- Where's Spring Falls?
- Some 50 miles from here.

817
01:41:01,535 --> 01:41:05,535
- They said we have to go there.
- Yeah. That's right. We heard that too.

818
01:41:12,202 --> 01:41:13,535
No.

819
01:41:20,452 --> 01:41:22,285
It's too far. We'll never make it.

820
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:26,119
I'm gonna draw them away from the house.

821
01:41:26,285 --> 01:41:29,285
And when it's clear,
you get to the truck...

822
01:41:29,452 --> 01:41:32,452
but don't start it.
Not until I give you the signal.

823
01:41:41,952 --> 01:41:43,619
What's going on?

824
01:41:43,785 --> 01:41:45,785
He's drawing them away from the house.

825
01:42:03,244 --> 01:42:05,202
Lu, listen to me.

826
01:42:06,244 --> 01:42:08,702
There's something I need to tell you.

827
01:42:12,119 --> 01:42:14,202
When this is all over...

828
01:42:14,827 --> 01:42:16,494
no matter what...

829
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:21,744
No matter what, always brush your teeth
before bedtime. Okay?

830
01:42:42,619 --> 01:42:45,952
And now we're gonna kick
these monsters out of here, princess.

831
01:43:00,285 --> 01:43:01,702
Right here.

832
01:43:01,869 --> 01:43:03,785
I'm right here. Come on.

833
01:43:03,952 --> 01:43:05,535
Come on.

834
01:43:05,869 --> 01:43:08,869
Come on. I'm right here. Come on.

835
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:11,910
Right here. I'm right here.

836
01:43:12,077 --> 01:43:14,952
Come on. Come on.

837
01:43:22,119 --> 01:43:23,702
Right here.

838
01:43:24,743 --> 01:43:26,743
Right here. Come on.

839
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:30,202
That's right, fuckers. Come on.

840
01:43:35,285 --> 01:43:37,118
Come on.

841
01:43:40,785 --> 01:43:42,827
All right. All right, now.

842
01:43:42,993 --> 01:43:44,660
Come on. Come on, now. Come on.

843
01:43:57,077 --> 01:43:59,577
I know you're all cosy inside.

844
01:43:59,743 --> 01:44:01,702
But I really...

845
01:44:02,243 --> 01:44:06,577
We really wanna meet you, little girl,
so don't get too comfortable in there.

846
01:44:06,743 --> 01:44:09,118
Hey, don't say that.

847
01:44:09,285 --> 01:44:11,452
I'm not talking to you.

848
01:44:14,535 --> 01:44:16,202
Now, you gotta come out soon.

849
01:44:16,827 --> 01:44:18,660
And I hope, for your sake...

850
01:44:18,827 --> 01:44:20,660
that you look like your mother.

851
01:44:20,827 --> 01:44:26,327
Because right now,
there is nothing more beautiful.

852
01:45:19,035 --> 01:45:20,327
Lu.

853
01:45:22,285 --> 01:45:23,785
Look.

854
01:45:57,535 --> 01:45:58,868
Look, Dad.

855
01:45:59,035 --> 01:46:01,368
I can see China.

856
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:07,785
Now what?
