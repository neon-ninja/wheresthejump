1
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:48,003
one three one
this is the dispacher go ahead

2
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:52,441
This is one three one! We have a male,
mid-fifties with burns over nine to nine

3
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,604
and a half percent of his body!

4
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:56,927
Prior to our arrival on scene,
patient apparently doused his head,

5
00:02:56,927 --> 00:03:00,066
neck and face with some
sort of highly concentrated acid!

6
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:03,543
Patient’s airway is severely
compromised due to fume inhalation!

7
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:06,394
Vital signs unstable! Please
advise!

8
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,115
Patient is a criminal
suspect!

9
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:10,312
We’re coming in with a
police escort right now!

10
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,668
hi

11
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:36,099
Can I talk to him?

12
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:40,693
He can’t actually talk...

13
00:03:47,397 --> 00:03:50,598
alright . Jesus...

14
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:53,355
can I  just
have a few minutes?

15
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:03,525
We wanna know who you are.

16
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,839
We’ll find out, you know. Sooner or
later.

17
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,447
You could save us some
legwork by communicating with us now.

18
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:18,190
Are you a Satanist? You in some
kind of cult?

19
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:23,374
Coz if there are  others involved,
we’ll find them too, believe me.

20
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:30,237
What’s the matter?
Is that it?

21
00:05:30,237 --> 00:05:32,933
Is there someone you
wanna tell me about?

22
00:05:40,065 --> 00:05:42,896
I’m sorry. The Nurse at reception
downstairs is on the phone.

23
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:44,934
She wants to talk to you.
Says it’s urgent.

24
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:48,202
i m coming

25
00:05:57,948 --> 00:05:58,819
I’ll be right back.

26
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:17,575
yeah

27
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:26,118
His daughter? When was this -- is
she still here...?

28
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:35,767
did she leave any information,
a phone number...?

29
00:06:39,034 --> 00:06:40,372
What do you mean a little girl?
How little...?

30
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:58,135
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph...

31
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:23,178
There is sin and evil in the world,

32
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,171
and we’re enjoined by scripture and
the Lord Jesus to oppose it with allour might.

33
00:07:29,754 --> 00:07:32,461
Our nation, too, has a
legacy of evil with which it must deal.

34
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:38,616
The glory of this land has been its capacity
for transcending the moral evils of our past...

35
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:16,774
Eat some now, save some for later...

36
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:19,798
Eat some now, save some for later...

37
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:21,813
Now and Later...

38
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,450
the really tasty
treat...

39
00:08:25,578 --> 00:08:27,089
Now and Later...

40
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:29,479
the
flavor can’t be beat..

41
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:31,826
Look at all those pieces

42
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:32,943
Owen...?

43
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:35,326
Flavors that are wow...

44
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:41,401
- Owwwwen...?
- What...?!

45
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:44,074
Dinner time honey...!

46
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,116
....and these Thy gifts,
for which we are about to receive,

47
00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:14,302
..please guide and direct us for all our days.
And protect us from evil. Amen.

48
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:19,217
How was school today?

49
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,882
you didn’t go and spoil your dinner on me now,
did you? Owen?

50
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,690
...No...  I didn’t...

51
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:38,348
Eat. Please, honey.

52
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:43,905
Hello?
What?

53
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:49,257
Look, I’m not
gonna discuss this now?

54
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:50,381
We’re eating dinner

55
00:09:57,504 --> 00:09:58,523
we had an agreement, John.

56
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:04,221
I think maybe you
better call my lawyer okay...?

57
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:11,500
Don’t talk to me like that

58
00:10:14,843 --> 00:10:16,987
I will
not. Be spoken to. In that way!

59
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:48,412
Hey little girl...

60
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,566
Are you a little girl...?

61
00:10:55,516 --> 00:10:56,290
are you scared?

62
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:52,402
I pledge allegiance... to the flag...
of the United States of America...

63
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,779
And to the Republic... for which it
stands...

64
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,732
One Nation... under God...

65
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:02,741
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

66
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,982
Mr. Zoric...?

67
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:37,237
Okay, Kenny! Ten laps! Now!

68
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:38,664
I didn’t do anything...!

69
00:15:39,086 --> 00:15:41,160
Now! Or I make it twenty!

70
00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:14,683
Hey little girl...

71
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:21,647
Ow! Don’t...!

72
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:22,843
Are you a little girl...?

73
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,324
That’s why he won’t go swimming

74
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:30,157
he doesn’t want everyone to see what
a little fucking girl he is

75
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,478
Hold him down! Get his arms! Get
his arms!

76
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:45,641
stop

77
00:16:57,285 --> 00:16:59,562
Dude, shit! I think he pissed
himself!

78
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,947
Oh...! Shit...!

79
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:02,704
He fucking pissed himself!

80
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:05,622
Jesus! Fucking freak!

81
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:35,102
is that is for you?

82
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:54,391
Are you scared, little girl? Huh?

83
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,993
What are you doing?

84
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:16,539
Nothing

85
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,599
What are you doing?

86
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:22,027
Nothing.

87
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:26,846
You guys just moved in, huh?
Upstairs.

88
00:18:28,322 --> 00:18:29,097
How do you know?

89
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:30,505
I live next door to you.

90
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:33,104
Right there.

91
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:47,452
Just so you know, I can’t be your
friend.

92
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:51,582
...Why not?

93
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:54,452
That’s just the way it is.

94
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:12,106
who said I wanted to be your friend...?!

95
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:03,723
god!

96
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:12,398
what am i supposed to do?

97
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:17,955
to go out in there and do it myself? Huh?

98
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:22,947
what?
answer me

99
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:34,417
maybe i m getting slow

100
00:24:39,163 --> 00:24:40,356
maybe i want to get caught...

101
00:24:46,237 --> 00:24:47,997
maybe i m just tired

102
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:29,297
excuse me
can I get through here?

103
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:40,288
As some of you may have heard, there
was an incident last night

104
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:43,769
and one
of our recent graduates was killed...

105
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:48,555
i want assure you that everything possible is being
done to find those responsible for this tragedy,

106
00:25:50,536 --> 00:25:51,812
but in
the mean time

107
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:55,782
we should all be on the
lookout for any suspicious activity...

108
00:25:57,811 --> 00:26:01,232
Your safety is our number on concern.

109
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:33,581
it’s you again, huh?

110
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:37,767
You know, I really wanna be left
alone..

111
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:39,138
Me too.

112
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,686
So leave.

113
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,268
You leave.

114
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:44,172
I’ve lived here  longer than
you...

115
00:26:50,096 --> 00:26:51,184
What is that?

116
00:26:55,162 --> 00:26:55,898
...This?

117
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,645
It’s a Rubik’s Cube.

118
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:04,446
You don’t know Rubik’s Cube?

119
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:08,596
Is it a puzzle?

120
00:27:11,655 --> 00:27:14,562
Yeah... Wanna try?

121
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:17,303
You can give it back
tomorrow.

122
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:20,909
...How do you do it?

123
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:29,702
You gotta make each side all one
color.

124
00:27:42,849 --> 00:27:43,517
like that

125
00:27:57,792 --> 00:27:58,951
...You smell kinda funny.

126
00:28:06,264 --> 00:28:06,864
Aren’t you cold?

127
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,100
I don’t really get cold

128
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,955
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

129
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:26,690
Help me...

130
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:33,193
...Hello?

131
00:29:36,465 --> 00:29:41,212
Please... Help me...

132
00:29:56,618 --> 00:29:57,721
...Hello?

133
00:30:03,256 --> 00:30:08,047
Hey there... Are you okay?

134
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:09,320
What happened?

135
00:30:12,996 --> 00:30:14,193
I fell...

136
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:18,265
Yeah...?

137
00:30:21,677 --> 00:30:22,908
Can’t you get up...?

138
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:24,629
No...

139
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:27,659
How old are you, sweetheart?

140
00:30:28,714 --> 00:30:30,016
Do you live around here...?

141
00:30:33,223 --> 00:30:34,313
I live right here...

142
00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:39,165
Can you carry
me...?

143
00:30:41,557 --> 00:30:46,552
Okay, sweetheart... sure... Why
don’t you... here...

144
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You got it...?

145
00:32:07,473 --> 00:32:10,462
you expect me to clean it up now...!

146
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,681
don't you?

147
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:16,159
...fucking bitch!

148
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:39,841
How did you do it?!

149
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,591
I just... twisted it.

150
00:34:52,805 --> 00:34:54,247
Do I smell better now?

151
00:34:58,574 --> 00:34:59,416
...What’s your name?

152
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,949
Abby. What’s yours...?

153
00:35:02,653 --> 00:35:03,391
I’m Owen.

154
00:35:06,485 --> 00:35:07,330
How old are you?

155
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:11,902
Twelve. More or less. What about
you?

156
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:15,630
Twelve years, eight months, and
nine days

157
00:35:16,298 --> 00:35:17,528
what do you mean,
“more or less”...?

158
00:35:18,127 --> 00:35:18,864
When’s your
birthday?

159
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:20,377
I don’t know.

160
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,911
You don’t know?

161
00:35:24,704 --> 00:35:26,286
Don’t you
celebrate your birthday?

162
00:35:29,874 --> 00:35:32,336
- Don’t you get birthday presents?
- No.

163
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:40,283
Well... you can... have this. If
you want.

164
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,307
That’s okay. It’s yours.

165
00:35:48,935 --> 00:35:50,096
I really don’t get how you did
this...

166
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:52,169
...Want me to show you?

167
00:35:52,909 --> 00:35:53,541
Yeah...

168
00:36:08,678 --> 00:36:13,533
I must be gone and live, or stay
and die...

169
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:17,782
Yon light is not day-light,

170
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,088
I know it

171
00:36:25,592 --> 00:36:29,985
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,

172
00:37:28,784 --> 00:37:29,979
What were you writing back
there...?

173
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:32,549
...What do you mean?

174
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:34,131
In Cook’s class.

175
00:37:36,523 --> 00:37:37,227
Let’s see it...

176
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,576
- ...No
- ...No?

177
00:37:50,492 --> 00:37:51,088
Where is it...?

178
00:37:53,903 --> 00:37:54,606
Where is it...?

179
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:56,191
Show me!

180
00:38:00,482 --> 00:38:01,889
- ...Jesus Christ, dude...!
- ...What...?

181
00:38:02,487 --> 00:38:03,368
You explain that to his mom...

182
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:09,701
That’s okay...

183
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:14,802
She’s not going to tell her mom on
us, is she...?

184
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:17,709
She fell down on
the playground, that’s all...

185
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:18,939
Right?

186
00:38:22,022 --> 00:38:22,967
Right...?

187
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:28,105
Say it, little girl... Say it...

188
00:38:37,705 --> 00:38:39,006
come on, dude... Let’s go...

189
00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:44,667
I fell down...
...On the playground.

190
00:38:46,297 --> 00:38:47,983
Well you have to be more careful,
Okay honey?

191
00:38:51,043 --> 00:38:53,257
I don’t like to
see my baby hurt...

192
00:38:56,114 --> 00:39:01,616
Bless us o Lord and these thy gifts...

193
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:03,006
and protect us from evil

194
00:39:06,373 --> 00:39:08,377
look , I made one for you,
and one for me

195
00:39:15,023 --> 00:39:16,148
Are you reading this?

196
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:20,334
It’s for school, it’s boring
c’mon, look...! It’s so cool...!

197
00:39:22,478 --> 00:39:24,061
We can talk to each other...!
Through the wall...!

198
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:30,658
Can you hear me through the wall?

199
00:39:36,812 --> 00:39:38,289
...Only sometimes..

200
00:39:40,787 --> 00:39:42,052
Did you hear anything the other
night...?

201
00:39:45,331 --> 00:39:47,113
why was your dad so mad...?

202
00:39:57,586 --> 00:40:00,415
Where’s your mom...?
Are you parents divorced?

203
00:40:00,694 --> 00:40:02,265
My mom is dead

204
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:10,141
My mom and dad are getting a divorce.

205
00:40:16,965 --> 00:40:18,336
What happened there...?

206
00:40:22,801 --> 00:40:24,174
Just some kids. At school.

207
00:40:25,861 --> 00:40:27,955
Where do you go to school anyway?
I never see you....

208
00:40:27,955 --> 00:40:29,098
...Owen, listen.

209
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:32,685
...What...?

210
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:34,650
You have to hit back.

211
00:40:36,657 --> 00:40:37,710
You have to hit back hard.

212
00:40:38,445 --> 00:40:41,328
i can't
...There are three

213
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:43,824
Then you hit back even harder.

214
00:40:47,308 --> 00:40:50,755
Hit them harder than you dare
And then they’ll stop.

215
00:40:50,508 --> 00:40:52,195
...What if they hit me back?

216
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:53,674
You have a knife.

217
00:40:54,442 --> 00:40:57,205
Yeah... But what if that didn't
stop them?

218
00:41:01,532 --> 00:41:02,904
I’ll help you.

219
00:41:06,504 --> 00:41:07,771
But.. You’re a girl...

220
00:41:14,525 --> 00:41:16,706
I’m a lot stronger than you
think I am

221
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:36,965
...I have to get in there...!

222
00:41:37,888 --> 00:41:38,558
...Move...

223
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:44,185
...Move...

224
00:42:03,494 --> 00:42:06,876
- Mr. Zoric...?
- Yes, Owen?

225
00:42:07,283 --> 00:42:10,273
I was wondering. About the after
school strength training?

226
00:42:11,539 --> 00:42:13,209
Can people still sign up?

227
00:42:14,722 --> 00:42:16,121
...You like to get strong?

228
00:42:19,535 --> 00:42:23,879
Okay. Four o’clock. You come. We
make you strong.

229
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:26,875
Cool...

230
00:43:45,573 --> 00:43:49,502
you want some?! They’re really good!
They’re my favorite!

231
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:51,171
- They’re really really good!

232
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:54,895
- no thanks

233
00:43:58,171 --> 00:44:01,343
What do you like...?
You can have anything you want...!

234
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:02,762
That's ok..

235
00:44:05,114 --> 00:44:06,378
Okay...!

236
00:44:07,302 --> 00:44:08,824
I guess that’s it...!

237
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:18,572
i guess i could have one

238
00:44:20,542 --> 00:44:21,958

239
00:44:23,262 --> 00:44:24,890

240
00:45:09,054 --> 00:45:10,252
...Sorry

241
00:45:23,488 --> 00:45:25,147
Owen... Do you like me?

242
00:45:28,482 --> 00:45:30,216
Yeah...

243
00:45:30,847 --> 00:45:31,776
A lot.

244
00:45:36,856 --> 00:45:42,792
Would you still like me... even if
I wasn’t a girl...?

245
00:45:47,308 --> 00:45:48,813
...What do you mean...?

246
00:45:54,202 --> 00:45:57,425
I don't know... I guess...

247
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:07,089
...Why?

248
00:46:11,787 --> 00:46:13,558
No reason...

249
00:46:19,886 --> 00:46:23,337
So where are you guys from?
How come you moved here...?

250
00:46:23,337 --> 00:46:28,586
We... move around a lot.

251
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:32,256
Yeah, but why would you move here?

252
00:46:32,547 --> 00:46:36,268
Nobody moves here
I hate it here

253
00:46:37,732 --> 00:46:39,163
Someday I’m gonna
get out...

254
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,628
And I’ll never come back...

255
00:46:43,025 --> 00:46:44,937
People here ....

256
00:46:47,615 --> 00:46:50,643

257
00:46:57,451 --> 00:46:58,940

268
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:17,878
Please don’t see that boy again...

269
00:49:22,065 --> 00:49:22,769
Okay...?

00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:21,835

00:51:31,816 --> 00:51:34,052

00:54:59,214 --> 00:55:02,845
Over there

293
00:55:02,956 --> 00:55:03,976
Hey!

294
00:55:25,927 --> 00:55:27,226
There!

295
00:56:06,016 --> 00:56:08,132
an unidentified man has been arrested

296
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:11,767
in connection with the recent ritual
murder of a local high school honor student...

297
00:56:11,945 --> 00:56:14,135
...The suspect is hospitalized in
critical condition

298
00:56:14,145 --> 00:56:17,723
with severe, self-inflicted acid
burns over his face and torso

299
00:56:17,724 --> 00:56:22,060
making it impossible so far for
authorities to determine his identity...

300
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:33,173
Ladies and gentlemen, the President
of the United States: Ronald Reagan!

301
00:56:43,353 --> 00:56:45,220
Excuse me!

302
00:56:46,295 --> 00:56:48,307
I'm looking for my father.

303
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,705
Is he a patient here...?

304
00:56:52,883 --> 00:56:56,564
Yeah... They... brought him in...

305
00:56:58,607 --> 00:57:00,473
...The police did.

306
00:57:00,753 --> 00:57:02,904
...Oh... I see...

307
00:57:03,515 --> 00:57:05,095
Do you know where he is...?

308
00:57:05,211 --> 00:57:09,105
He’s... he’s on the tenth floor,
sweetie... But it’s restricted...

309
00:57:09,339 --> 00:57:12,750
- why don’t I call them, tell them you’re here..?
-  Oh, no -- that’s okay...

310
00:57:19,918 --> 00:57:22,393
Oh my God -- you poor girl...

311
00:57:23,275 --> 00:57:24,609
Sweetie!

312
00:57:24,985 --> 00:57:26,210
Sweetie!

313
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,416
...May I come in...?

314
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,914
...I’m sorry...

315
01:00:05,115 --> 01:00:08,686
His daughter? When was this -- is
she still here...?

316
01:00:14,826 --> 01:00:17,980
Well did she leave any information,
a phone number...?

317
01:00:20,193 --> 01:00:23,007
What do you mean a little girl?
How little...?

318
01:00:37,982 --> 01:00:39,705
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

319
01:00:39,755 --> 01:00:41,255
Help!

320
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:25,019
Owen!

321
01:01:26,212 --> 01:01:27,523
Owen!

322
01:01:29,627 --> 01:01:31,359
Can I come in...?

323
01:01:33,005 --> 01:01:36,055
No...wait
don’t look at me...

324
01:02:34,506 --> 01:02:36,631
How’d you get up here...?

325
01:02:38,015 --> 01:02:40,595
- I flew.
- Yeah, right...

326
01:02:43,636 --> 01:02:47,197
Hey... you’re not wearing
anything...!

327
01:02:48,891 --> 01:02:51,035
And you’re freezing...!

328
01:02:52,015 --> 01:02:53,753
Is that gross...?

329
01:02:55,478 --> 01:02:56,308
No.

330
01:02:59,153 --> 01:03:00,971
Abby?

331
01:03:02,059 --> 01:03:03,271
Yeah...?

332
01:03:06,321 --> 01:03:08,944
Will you go steady with me?

333
01:03:10,085 --> 01:03:13,211
- What do you mean?
- Will you be my girlfriend...?

334
01:03:13,925 --> 01:03:15,311
Owen...

335
01:03:17,435 --> 01:03:19,353
I am not a girl.

336
01:03:20,499 --> 01:03:23,415
- You’re not a girl...?
- No.

337
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,916
What are you...?

338
01:03:29,108 --> 01:03:30,808
Nothing.

339
01:03:31,591 --> 01:03:33,050
Oh

340
01:03:33,915 --> 01:03:36,965
You know, it’s okay if you don’t
wanna be my girlfriend.

341
01:03:37,275 --> 01:03:39,525
You don’t
have to make stuff up...

342
01:03:45,165 --> 01:03:50,925
- Can’t we just keep things the way they are...?
- Yeah.. sure...

343
01:03:54,845 --> 01:03:56,384
Well...

344
01:03:56,685 --> 01:04:00,850
Do you... have to... do anything special?

345
01:04:01,156 --> 01:04:02,878
when you go steady...?

346
01:04:02,902 --> 01:04:04,379
No.

347
01:04:06,381 --> 01:04:09,708
-So everything’s the same?
- Yeah...

348
01:04:13,046 --> 01:04:14,543
Okay.

349
01:04:16,075 --> 01:04:19,313
-  We can go steady.
- Really?

350
01:04:21,005 --> 01:04:22,456
Yes.

351
01:04:46,765 --> 01:04:51,374
"I must be gone and live, or stay and die. "
ABBY + OWEN

352

Faster, faster!

What you think you’re gonna do with

01:06:40,650 --> 01:06:44,240
I’m gonna... hit you with it... If

You know what I think?

362
01:06:52,201 --> 01:06:54,736
I don’t think you’re gonna do a
fucking thing...

363
01:06:56,522 --> 01:06:59,631
I think you’re just gonna stand there,
like the  little girl you are...

364
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:03,309
And I’m gonna grab that stick...
and ram it right up your ass...

365
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:08,855
And then...?
You’re goin’ swimming.

366
01:07:11,553 --> 01:07:12,880
hey hey
quickly

367
01:07:17,646 --> 01:07:20,922
Dude....Zoric is over there
checking us out

368
01:07:21,005 --> 01:07:23,533
let it go...
We’ll beat his little ass later...

369
01:07:24,588 --> 01:07:26,389
Give me the stick...

370
01:07:29,996 --> 01:07:31,151
Give me the stick...

371
01:07:38,323 --> 01:07:40,473
Holy shit! Are you fucking crazy!?

372
01:07:41,154 --> 01:07:42,525
Hey!

373
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:10,025
Okay.
Please, move back.

374
01:08:10,131 --> 01:08:11,711
move back

375
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:36,550
Give me one reason I shouldn’t
suspend you, Owen...

376
01:08:37,315 --> 01:08:38,897
Can you think of one?

377
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:42,360
Don’t you know what
could’ve happened...?

378
01:08:43,969 --> 01:08:46,150
You seem like a smart kid.

379
01:08:46,371 --> 01:08:49,023
I just don’t want to see you going down
the wrong path...

380
01:08:49,702 --> 01:08:53,105
He’s a good boy... he really is...

381
01:08:55,078 --> 01:08:56,895
Hello...? Is John there...?

382
01:08:57,338 --> 01:09:00,514
Excuse me...? This is his wife
who’s this...?

383
01:09:01,968 --> 01:09:06,555
hello, Cindy... Could you
please tell John that I called?

384
01:09:07,969 --> 01:09:11,284
Hi there... Your mom or dad home?

385
01:09:12,471 --> 01:09:14,755
Yes. Mom!

386
01:09:16,395 --> 01:09:17,738
What?

387
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:22,393
- Sorry to bother you, Ma'am.

388
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:23,740
What’s this about...?

389
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:27,009
I’m afraid there’s been an incident
with one of your neighbors here in the complex...

390
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,057
So we’re just going around, talking to people...
see if anyone knows anything...

391
01:09:30,117 --> 01:09:32,099
What kind of incident?

392
01:09:34,815 --> 01:09:37,039
Owen, why don’t you go to your
room...?

393
01:11:54,841 --> 01:11:57,248
- Sorry, guys!
- you wonder?

394
01:11:57,259 --> 01:11:58,859
- what?

395
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,060
why do you need glasses?
so dangerous?

396
01:12:03,053 --> 01:12:06,075
- Hey! Stop!
- How’s the cripple...!?

397
01:12:06,176 --> 01:12:07,676
Stop! Hey!

398
01:12:09,587 --> 01:12:11,878
Jesus Christ, dude... look out...!

399
01:12:11,959 --> 01:12:15,300
Man, that kid wailed on your ass
Can you still hear me, bro  ?!

400
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:16,548
Stop!

401
01:12:17,325 --> 01:12:21,233
- You going home?
-No, we’re going over to Mark’s...

402
01:12:21,434 --> 01:12:25,468
Well can I borrow your keys...? I
forgot mine... Please...?

403
01:12:26,405 --> 01:12:28,470
Give me the fucking keys!

404
01:12:33,151 --> 01:12:34,470
Thanks!

405
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:36,855
- See you at home, little girl...
- Hey!

406
01:12:41,367 --> 01:12:43,140
- Shut up!
- But I didn't say anything!

407
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:44,555
Shut up!

408
01:12:50,559 --> 01:12:53,339
Abby, I did it!

409
01:12:54,025 --> 01:12:55,827
You did what...?

410
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:57,918
They were gonna push me in a hole.
In the ice.

411
01:12:57,919 --> 01:13:01,255
So I got a big stick
and I hit him in the head really hard.

412
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:05,969
He had to go to the hospital
I almost got suspended.

413
01:13:06,175 --> 01:13:10,715
But I did it. What you said.
I stood up to them.

414
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:13,893
Owen...

415
01:13:14,902 --> 01:13:16,169
...Yeah?

416
01:13:33,633 --> 01:13:38,955
- Hey... You wanna go somewhere...?
- Where?

417
01:13:42,579 --> 01:13:45,201
“ENTER UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH”

418
01:13:57,305 --> 01:13:59,652
- It's pretty cool huh?
- Yes.

419
01:14:00,953 --> 01:14:04,455
This this kid who used to live
in the building. Tommy.

420
01:14:04,916 --> 01:14:10,445
He would come down here and drink and 
smoke with his high school friends, and..

421
01:14:10,656 --> 01:14:14,122
And when they weren't here,
He would play ping-pong with me.

422
01:14:14,223 --> 01:14:16,323
He was really cool

423
01:14:18,095 --> 01:14:20,421
Then he had to move away.

424
01:14:24,649 --> 01:14:26,517
I kinda like it here...

425
01:14:28,359 --> 01:14:30,191
It’s cool...

426
01:14:30,892 --> 01:14:35,155
I don’t think any of the adults
know about it... just us.

427
01:14:59,639 --> 01:15:03,675
So... what did you want to do down
here...?

428
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,753
I think I have an idea...

429
01:15:09,854 --> 01:15:11,703
close your eyes...

430
01:15:12,426 --> 01:15:14,092
keep them closed

431
01:15:28,726 --> 01:15:30,900
Let's make a pact.

432
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,851
it only hurts for a second

433
01:15:36,736 --> 01:15:38,133
Here.

434
01:15:58,778 --> 01:16:00,260
Abby?

435
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:19,634
Go away...!

436
01:16:37,681 --> 01:16:39,232
Goddammit ... Virginia...!

437
01:16:39,727 --> 01:16:41,307
Phooey! Virginia!

438
01:16:44,028 --> 01:16:45,640
Virginia!

439
01:16:55,186 --> 01:16:56,592
What the FUCK ?!

440
01:16:56,638 --> 01:16:58,315
Leave her alone!

441
01:17:04,996 --> 01:17:06,387
Hey!

442
01:17:07,286 --> 01:17:08,676
Hey!

443
01:17:15,183 --> 01:17:17,510
Somebody call 9-1-1...!!!

444
01:17:52,866 --> 01:17:54,263
Mom!

445
01:17:59,453 --> 01:18:01,084
Mom!

446
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:09,649
Hello!

447
01:18:10,177 --> 01:18:11,868
Dad?

448
01:18:12,269 --> 01:18:14,169
Can I talk to you?

449
01:18:14,249 --> 01:18:16,332
...Sure, pal... What is it...?

450
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:19,259
i don't know...

451
01:18:21,542 --> 01:18:25,457
...Do you think...?
Is there such a thing As evil?

452
01:18:27,177 --> 01:18:28,650
What?

453
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:33,315
What are you talking about, pal...?

454
01:18:36,018 --> 01:18:40,150
-...Can people be evil??
- Where are you getting this...?

455
01:18:41,054 --> 01:18:42,937
From your mother...?

456
01:18:43,138 --> 01:18:45,663
-All her religious crap...?
- No.

457
01:18:45,703 --> 01:18:49,450
You know what? Owen, listen put
your mother on the phone, I wanna talk to her...

458
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:52,900
she’s not here...

459
01:18:53,549 --> 01:18:58,438
All right. please have her call me when
she gets back, alright...?

460
01:19:00,161 --> 01:19:01,521
Well.

461
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,184
Dad!

462
01:19:03,215 --> 01:19:06,220
Owen, I want you to get that crap
out of your head, okay?

463
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:12,895
You mother just... she has problems... and I’m
gonna talk to her.

464
01:19:12,925 --> 01:19:16,872
So I don’t want to hear
any more about this, alright?

465
01:19:19,657 --> 01:19:21,099
alright?

466
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:23,030
...Yeah...

467
01:19:23,528 --> 01:19:27,055
You have a good
night, pal. I love you.

468
01:19:27,226 --> 01:19:32,922
And I’m sorry about the last couple months,
but I’ll see you real soon, okay?

469
01:19:33,158 --> 01:19:36,607
- I promise! Maybe next weekend.
- Okay...

470
01:19:40,037 --> 01:19:42,052
I love you!

471
01:20:05,803 --> 01:20:07,627
Can I come in...?

472
01:20:14,881 --> 01:20:17,004
...You have to say it...

473
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,410
...You can... come in..

474
01:20:58,435 --> 01:21:00,404
Are you a vampire...?

475
01:21:07,581 --> 01:21:11,700
I... need blood. To live.

476
01:21:12,438 --> 01:21:16,455
- How old are you? Really.
- twelve...

477
01:21:18,151 --> 01:21:19,827
But...

478
01:21:22,066 --> 01:21:24,602
I been twelve for a very
long time...

479
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:38,491
Where’s your dad...?

480
01:21:42,194 --> 01:21:44,261
...He wasn’t... my dad...

481
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:57,838
What this stuff?

482
01:21:58,836 --> 01:22:00,730
I like puzzles.

483
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,172
I’m wanna go home now...

484
01:22:29,394 --> 01:22:31,117
I wanna go.

485
01:22:31,258 --> 01:22:33,566
Are you gonna let me...?

486
01:22:35,466 --> 01:22:37,626
What are you gonna do to me...?

487
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:44,370
...I told you we couldn’t be friends...

488
01:23:19,672 --> 01:23:22,008
Hi... Are you Larry...?

489
01:23:22,536 --> 01:23:24,620
can i talk to you for a
minute...?

490
01:23:26,228 --> 01:23:27,680
Sure.

491
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,208
Sorry to bother you.

492
01:23:41,609 --> 01:23:43,600
..How’s... she doing...?

493
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:47,217
It’s been... quite a night

494
01:23:48,418 --> 01:23:50,775
They had to give her
almost six pints of blood...

495
01:23:50,814 --> 01:23:53,727
We’re still waiting to
see if her body rejects it.

496
01:23:56,724 --> 01:23:59,313
I won’t keep you too long.
I just want...

497
01:23:59,533 --> 01:24:04,533
I need to ask you about the
description you gave. Of the little girl.

498
01:24:05,181 --> 01:24:08,203
You said she had long blonde hair

499
01:24:08,604 --> 01:24:13,346
was around twelve years old,
and wasn’t wearing shoes...

500
01:24:13,517 --> 01:24:14,767
- Right?
- Right!

501
01:24:14,777 --> 01:24:17,450
Have you ever seen this man?

502
01:24:24,557 --> 01:24:26,800
He’s a suspect in a murder investigation.

503
01:24:27,157 --> 01:24:29,257
Maybe... Looks like a guy
in our building

504
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:33,155
Did he have a daughter? Like the
girl you described?

505
01:24:33,255 --> 01:24:35,946
I don’t know.
I’ve only seen him a few times...

506
01:24:38,557 --> 01:24:41,750
Why?
You think this is related to the murder case?

507
01:24:41,885 --> 01:24:45,745
Maybe. I began to believe that two of
victims were part of a Satanic cult.

508
01:24:45,835 --> 01:24:47,160
What?

509
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:49,352
We found another body few days ago...

510
01:24:49,372 --> 01:24:51,705
Same M.O. The victim was
completely drained of blood...

511
01:24:51,715 --> 01:24:56,765
But there were bite marks on the
victim’s neck. Small ones. Like a child’s

512
01:24:56,885 --> 01:24:58,652
Jesus Christ!

513
01:25:20,839 --> 01:25:24,168
Jesus Christ!
Virginia! God!

514
01:25:24,656 --> 01:25:26,679
Jesus Christ!

515
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:28,320
No!

516
01:25:38,526 --> 01:25:41,840
“HI SWEETIE, MEETING WITH
THE LAWYER TONIGHT. BE HOME LATER.

517
01:25:41,841 --> 01:25:45,347
THERE’S A POT PIE IN THE
FREEZER! I LOVE YOU! GOD BLESS! MOM.”

518
01:25:45,357 --> 01:25:49,610
one patient who killed in a fire,
and one hospital nurse

519
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:55,323
the five alarm fire broke out on the
eight floor of the hospital..

520
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:58,448
The cause of the fire is
still under investigation, but....

521
01:26:04,013 --> 01:26:05,502
...Hey.

522
01:26:06,215 --> 01:26:07,743
...Hey.

523
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:18,579
You... have to invite me in.

524
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:21,767
It’s your home

525
01:26:22,305 --> 01:26:24,671
What if I don’t...?

526
01:26:25,626 --> 01:26:29,750
Why can’t you just come in...?
Is there something in your way...?

527
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:26,454
No! Stop! You can come in!
You can come in!

528
01:27:37,405 --> 01:27:39,152
What was that?

529
01:27:41,029 --> 01:27:42,886
I don't know.

530
01:27:44,057 --> 01:27:47,760
I just know this is what happens
if you don't invite me in.

531
01:27:51,271 --> 01:27:53,259
What if I didn’t say anything...?

532
01:27:54,807 --> 01:27:59,730
Would you have just kept bleeding...?
You'd have died?

533
01:28:02,588 --> 01:28:05,070
I knew you wouldn’t let me...

534
01:29:17,675 --> 01:29:20,811
You can borrow one of my mom’s old
dresses if you want...!

535
01:29:47,699 --> 01:29:48,907
Hello!

536
01:29:51,558 --> 01:29:52,984
Owen?

537
01:29:54,485 --> 01:29:56,635
I’m in here...! I'll be right there!

538
01:31:47,201 --> 01:31:53,046
“Hi, Owen. Good morning. I am
in the bathroom. Please do not come in.

539
01:31:54,088 --> 01:32:00,774
