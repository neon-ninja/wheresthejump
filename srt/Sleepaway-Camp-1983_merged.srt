1
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:04,692
Hey, get away from me with that
pail of water. I'll kill you.

2
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:16,120
Hey, what was the
elbow for, asshole?

3
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:39,810
Yeah, nice pitch! Get
two, get two, get two!

4
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,785
Cut it out! Daddy, tell
him to leave me alone.

5
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:24,830
- Peter started it!
- I did not, you liar!

6
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:26,540
- Did too.
- Did not.

7
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,834
Alright, let's settle
down and stop fighting.

8
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,695
She started it.

9
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:36,175
That looks neat.
Can I try it, Daddy?

10
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:39,370
Maybe in a couple years,
if we ever get a motorboat.

11
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:43,958
Can we go to the camp one summer?
I bet they'd show us there.

12
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,085
Well, I don't know about that.

13
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:50,881
Hang in there, Dolore!
You're doing great!

14
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,509
Can't we stop now?

15
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:56,486
Hey, Craig. How about letting
me take her out once, huh?

16
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,697
Come on, Mary Ann.
You know I can't do that.

17
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:01,366
Oh, don't be such a stiff.
I know how to drive these things.

18
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,452
My old man's got one twice as big.

19
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:06,622
Yeah, and is your old man gonna
give me a job when I get fired?

20
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:10,401
Lighten up, will you? No one's
gonna see us way out here.

21
00:04:27,352 --> 00:04:32,173
Oh, so you think it's funny,
huh? You little schemers!

22
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:36,886
Come on. Please?

23
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,196
Alright.

24
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:40,264
Super!

25
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,224
But look, just for a minute.

26
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:48,439
Not too fast!

27
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:54,028
Hey John, we gotta go meet the Doc.

28
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:59,825
John! It's almost 4:30.
Doc's gonna be here soon!

29
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:05,097
Come on, fellas. Doctor
Thomas is on her way up.

30
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:08,558
- Aunt Martha's coming?
- Is Ricky coming too?

31
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,240
Nah, I'm afraid he's spending
the weekend with his father.

32
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:18,094
You look like a skiing hunchback!
Straighten up, will ya?

33
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,243
Turn! Turn the boat!

34
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:28,495
- What'd she say?
- I don't know.

35
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,189
Hey!

36
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,753
There's a boat!

37
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,673
Stop the motor. Holy shit! Turn it!

38
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,242
Turn the wheel!

39
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:45,621
- I can't turn it!
- Give me the wheel!

40
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,057
John!

41
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:51,810
Oh my God!

42
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:56,690
Somebody help those people!
Get in the water!

43
00:05:56,691 --> 00:06:02,237
Get them onto the boat, please!
Oh my God, we just hit them both.

44
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:05,073
Oh my God.

45
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:08,910
Somebody help them. Please.

46
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:16,569
Help them! Please! They're
gonna die, I know it! Please!

47
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:20,823
Hurry! Help them! Please help them!

48
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:25,244
Oh my God, we just hit them both.

49
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:38,090
Hurry, sweeties. We don't
want to be late for the bus.

50
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,427
Goodness, no.
That wouldn't do at all.

51
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:48,601
Richard. Angela. Oh, here you are.

52
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:53,663
Look what I did. I packed you
and your cousin some goodies

53
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:57,985
for the ride up to camp.
Wasn't that nice of me, hmm?

54
00:06:58,669 --> 00:06:59,920
Any Chips?

55
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:04,450
Why, of course. I believe
there's a whole bag.

56
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,745
I'm almost sure of it.

57
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:15,602
Angela, isn't there anything special
my little girl would care for, hmm?

58
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:17,604
We gotta go, mom.
It's getting late.

59
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:21,233
Well of course you do, dear. We
wouldn't want them to leave without us,

60
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:22,676
now would we?

61
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:26,347
No. No, I'm afraid
that that wouldn't do.

62
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:32,102
Come, children. Let's
be on our way.

63
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,859
Now what?

64
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:44,281
I believe that I've forgotten
something. Now, what can it be?

65
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:49,511
Oh, I remember what it is.
I knew I would forget.

66
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:53,541
I just kept reminding myself.
In fact, I tied a string around...

67
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:58,963
Around my finger,
so I wouldn't forget.

68
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,397
See?

69
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:04,593
And I didn't. You never
can be too careful.

70
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:12,601
Well, what is it already?

71
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:19,567
Oh, just a moment!
I'll be right back!

72
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,945
Good old Mom's at it again.

73
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:27,048
Here they are! All filled out
and signed by yours truly.

74
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,426
Wasn't that nice of me, hmm?

75
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:32,387
- What are they?
- Why, they're your physicals, of course.

76
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:35,332
We can't go to camp without
our physicals, now can we?

77
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:38,794
Just be careful not to tell
anyone how you got them.

78
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:42,798
Oh, no, I'm afraid that they
wouldn't approve of that at all.

79
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,276
Even though they know
that I am a doctor.

80
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,596
No matter what they
do, I'll never tell.

81
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:52,474
Oh, you're such a dear.

82
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:56,036
Well, run along now.

83
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:59,789
- So long, Mom.
- Goodbye, my angel.

84
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,862
I hope you have a good time.
But of course you will.

85
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,907
Take good care of my
little girl, Richard!

86
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:12,328
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye, dear.

87
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:17,309
Look at all that young, fresh chicken.
Where I come from we call them baldies.

88
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,020
Makes your mouth water, don't it?

89
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:24,874
Artie. They're too young to even
understand what's on your mind.

90
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,987
Ben, good buddy, there ain't any
such thing as being too young.

91
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,322
You're just too old.

92
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,693
Ahh! Ricky, how you doin'?

93
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:53,862
- Paul, great to see you.
- You winning?

94
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:56,015
Ah, you know. Same old shit.

95
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,726
- Hey, this is my cousin Angela.
- How you doin'?

96
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:04,164
She's kind of shy, I guess. You know,
first time away from home and all.

97
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:07,042
Listen, I got to take her down to the
bunks. I'll catch you down the hill, ok?

98
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:08,193
You got it.

99
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:13,157
Hey, Rick.

100
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,617
Wait'll you get a load of Judy!

101
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,385
Man, oh, man.

102
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,928
Oh, yeah?

103
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,247
You'll see.

104
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:24,434
Me and Judy were steadies last summer.

105
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:26,515
Hey, you'll probably be in the same cabin.

106
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,907
These are all the girls' cabins.

107
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:42,494
Over there is the rec hall.
Next to that is Ronnie's shack.

108
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:45,939
Behind that's the archery
range. There she is!

109
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,985
Judy! Yo, Judy! How you doin'?

110
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,461
Alright.

111
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:53,655
Who's the wimp?

112
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,465
Oh, that's Ricky.

113
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,384
Wasn't he the kid you were
babysitting last year?

114
00:11:57,385 --> 00:11:59,870
Guess I'm not good
enough for her anymore.

115
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:07,227
Well, here you go, Angela.

116
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:09,312
If you need anything,
I'll be in bunk 19, below.

117
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:10,672
Second from the bottom.

118
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,573
- Who were those guys?
- Just some boys I met today.

119
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,601
Weren't they a little old for you?

120
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,994
Don't you know girls
mature before boys?

121
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,746
That's bullshit and you know it.

122
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,691
Ricky, I don't have time for
your nonsense right now.

123
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:34,571
Well, excuse me. Bitch.

124
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:48,852
Alright, ladies. Let's
hurry it up and unpack

125
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:50,170
so we can get these trunks
the hell out of here.

126
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:53,815
By the way, for those of you who
don't know, the name is Meg.

127
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,968
M-E-G.

128
00:12:57,111 --> 00:13:00,989
This here is Susie. You got any problems,
this is the complaint department.

129
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,891
Got it? Ok? Capische?

130
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,862
What are you looking at?

131
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,040
What, are you taking
pictures? Quit it!

132
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:31,879
You must be Angela. Remember?
Ronnie spoke to us about her.

133
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,174
Looks like we got a real winner here.

134
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,885
You ain't kidding.

135
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,940
Quiet, please.

136
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:57,321
Thanks for nothing.

137
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:01,700
Quiet, please.

138
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,049
See what I mean, Ronnie?
She hasn't even touched it.

139
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,486
Angela, Meg tells me you haven't
eaten much since you've been here.

140
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:22,362
Is that true?

141
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:25,974
You won't get a peep out of this one.
She hasn't said a word in three days.

142
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,786
Tell you what. How about if you and
me take a walk into the kitchen?

143
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:32,814
See if we can find something
you like. That sound okay?

144
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,626
I'm gonna take her inside to
see Artie. She'll be alright.

145
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,904
Probably a little homesick, is all.

146
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,155
Come on, Angela.

147
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:48,997
He's starting to spoil
the little brat already.

148
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:59,132
Hey Ben, is Artie around? Artie,
can I see you for a minute, please?

149
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:04,012
Hey, Artie. Be a little more
discrete with the beer can, huh?

150
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,406
Sure, Ron. What's up?

151
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:10,060
I want you to meet one of our new campers.
Angela, this is Artie, our head chef.

152
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:13,855
Well, hello there, Angela.

153
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,483
Can you get that, Ben? Please?

154
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,736
As you can see, she
isn't very talkative.

155
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,547
In fact, she isn't much of a
fan of your cooking, either.

156
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:25,425
You think you could find something
for her? Some ice cream, or, you know...

157
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:27,010
Phone for you and Mel, Ron.

158
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:29,012
Do me a favor. Get Mel, will you?

159
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:31,139
See what you can do, okay,
Artie? I'll catch you later.

160
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,583
No problem. I'll find
something she likes.

161
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,753
I'll bet we can find something
interesting in the walk-in.

162
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,923
You never know what you
can find in there.

163
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:48,557
Where's my cousin?

164
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:50,199
Ronnie took her into the kitchen.

165
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,769
- She eat anything?
- What do you think?

166
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:56,623
What's her problem, anyway? She don't eat,
she don't talk, she don't do anything.

167
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:59,318
Why don't you leave her
alone? She's just quiet.

168
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:04,323
If she were any quieter,
she'd be dead.

169
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,914
So Angela, see anything you like?

170
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,335
Maybe I can help you decide.

171
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:21,965
You sure are a sweet-looking
little cupcake, ain't you?

172
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,222
Yeah. Think I got something
you're gonna like real good.

173
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,227
Hey, what are you doing?!

174
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,664
Keep your mouth shut, you hear me?

175
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:39,916
You didn't see nothin'!
Got it? Nothin'!

176
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,598
- Sure. Whatever you want.
- Now get the hell out of here.

177
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,993
Hey, What's going on?

178
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:52,704
What was that all about?

179
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:56,500
Guess I scared him.

180
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,880
I guess so.

181
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:12,323
Want to check on the water?
About done over here.

182
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:15,602
That damn water better be done.
It's been on a half hour. Shit!

183
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:20,565
- Gimme that goddamn chair.
- All yours, my good man.

184
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,840
It's still got a couple minutes to go.

185
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:29,507
Gonna grab some hay
before dinner. You coming?

186
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:32,661
- Yeah, after I throw the corn in.
- See you later.

187
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,667
Boiling yet?

188
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,462
Atta girl.

189
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,336
Motherfucker, you
could have killed me!

190
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:50,530
Now get the hell over
here and help me down.

191
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,533
Come on, kid.

192
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:57,287
Get me down and I'll make you a
nice ice cream sundae, okay?

193
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,125
Hey, what the... What
the hell you doin'?!

194
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,018
You little shit!

195
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,354
When I get down from here I'm
gonna rip your fucking head off!

196
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,632
Ben! Help! Ben!

197
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:12,151
Ben! Get the hell in here! Ben!

198
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:15,446
Help! Ben! Ben!

199
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,640
Ben!

200
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:18,801
I'm afraid I don't carry a
sedative strong enough to mask

201
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:22,763
the kind of agony he's in right now. Every
nerve in his body must feel like it's on fire.

202
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:27,335
- What's the prognosis, Doc?
- Well, he's badly burned all over.

203
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,686
Especially his face.

204
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,255
How about his eyes?

205
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,316
Too early to tell.

206
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:36,761
- Jesus, the pain must be incredible.
- Poor guy must be going crazy.

207
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,279
Yeah, if he's lucky.

208
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,519
Look, can we move this along, please?
No need to upset the campers, right?

209
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,606
Well, I guess I'll be on my way.

210
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,625
Now what?

211
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,920
Now we get this ambulance out
of here as quickly as we can.

212
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,671
Why? It was only an accident.

213
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:59,133
Because I don't want the kids or their
parents to know that this ever happened.

214
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,410
You understand?

215
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,703
What about them?

216
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:03,872
Don't worry.

217
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:05,832
I'll take care of them.

218
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,393
Real shame what happened to Artie in here.

219
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,718
In the future, I hope the rest
of you will be more careful.

220
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,387
Ben?

221
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:24,059
I guess that makes you the
head man here now, doesn't it?

222
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:27,270
I wasn't thinking much
about myself, Mr. Costa.

223
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,790
I just don't see how something
like that could happen.

224
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,751
Come on now, Ben. We still got a
camp to feed here now, don't we?

225
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:34,919
Yes, sir.

226
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,590
Besides, fifty bucks more a week
can't be all that bad, now, can it?

227
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:45,179
No, sir. I always thought he
had a little devil in him.

228
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,084
And fifteen dollars a week
more for the rest of you, eh?

229
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:52,545
- That's real generous of you, sir.
- Well, now...

230
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:56,383
Ben, there is one thing, though...

231
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:04,057
There's really no reason for the
campers to find out what happened.

232
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:10,705
You know what I mean?
Too, um, gruesome, I think.

233
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:15,652
So why don't we just say that Artie found himself
another job, should anybody happen to ask.

234
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,338
Sure, sure. Whatever you say, sir.

235
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:23,201
Good, and do me a favor. Tell your
friends here to say the same thing.

236
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,760
You don't have to worry
none about them.

237
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:28,373
Good. Thanks, Ben. I knew
I could count on you.

238
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:33,628
- What do you say we get dinner going here, huh?
- Right away, sir.

239
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,554
Mind over matter is the key.

240
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:47,116
Mind over matter says that even the
incredibly simple task of a single sit-up

241
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:50,077
should be impossible,
should the mind will it.

242
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:52,772
Come on. There's no way.

243
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,442
Shut up, Mozart, and concentrate.

244
00:22:56,585 --> 00:23:00,155
Concentrate on summoning all your
strength for this single sit-up.

245
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:03,382
And you will be amazed when the
time comes that although the body

246
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:07,162
is willing, the mind refuses.

247
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:13,684
I will count to three. On three, you will
concentrate all your strength, only to

248
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:17,605
see the folly of it all. Concentrate,
dear boy. I cannot stress this enough.

249
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:20,300
Mind over matter. Mind over matter.

250
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,553
I shall now begin the count.

251
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:26,723
One.

252
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:28,892
Two.

253
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,144
Three!

254
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,897
You guys are gross!

255
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,460
Don't tell me Mozart fell for
the old mind over matter trick.

256
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,462
Oh, not Mozart.
He's too swift for that.

257
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:44,115
Hey, listen. Everybody grab
your glove. The games are on.

258
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:46,467
- They're gonna play us?
- Right now.

259
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:49,220
I got five bucks riding on
you guys, so don't lose.

260
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:51,347
No sweat, Gene. We're
gonna kick their asses.

261
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,750
Alright, you better. Let's go.

262
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,632
Come on, Ricky, babe.
Save me my ups.

263
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:00,972
Hey! Big man!

264
00:24:00,998 --> 00:24:04,452
You and your boys want to place a little
wager while the game is still close?

265
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:06,237
What do you have in mind, asswipe?

266
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:09,265
- Buck a man, asshole!
- That's a little steep.

267
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,143
- Make it five.
- You got it.

268
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,809
Come on, Chuck, he's a looker.

269
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:24,197
Nice shot, Rick, way to go!

270
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,683
Go Paul! Come on, Paul.

271
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:37,643
Make yourself useful and
bring me home, huh?

272
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:40,630
This little shit, will be
lucky to make contact.

273
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,864
Should've brought my rabbit's foot.

274
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:48,946
You got it, you got it, you got it!

275
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,641
You got it! Come on!
Get it! Get it!

276
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:01,860
Safe!

277
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,699
- Nice shot, man.
- Must have been lucky.

278
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:14,513
Come on, Billy, be a hitter Bill.
Come on, Bill!

279
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:18,350
No problem Geno, this guy blows
dead dogs. Just lay it in there.

280
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:21,770
- Eat shit and die, Ricky!
- Eat shit and live, Bill.

281
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:26,009
Yea Bill, he's a little wimp, Bill.

282
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,470
Come on, keep your eye on it.
Drive it in. Let's go.

283
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,225
Right there, Bill!
Go ahead. Go! Go! Go!

284
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,703
Wake up Mo!

285
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:39,413
Shit.

286
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:40,581
Come on, Mo!

287
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,734
You got it, babe!

288
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:50,283
Nice catch, Motz.

289
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,743
Get off, man.

290
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:56,138
Can you believe that? Hey, how
many we up by now, anyway?

291
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,833
I think it's 8-6.

292
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,275
Come on. Take the bat
off your shoulder.

293
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:09,469
Fuck you!

294
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:12,680
You tell him too, Rick.
You tell him, too.

295
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:29,296
What are you gonna do
with your big paycheck?

296
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:32,216
I don't know! Maybe I'll get
a Corvette or something.

297
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:33,175
How about you?

298
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:35,302
I think I'll take a cruise.

299
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:38,222
Hey, Mr. G! How about some
real competition next time?

300
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:42,210
Yeah! Maybe the girls want a game!

301
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:47,398
It's okay, we'll get 'em back.
Come on, we'll get 'em back.

302
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:49,217
Don't worry. We'll get 'em back.

303
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,418
We still need more babes.

304
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:11,572
I mean, who wants to go skinny dipping
with fifteen guys and only five girls?

305
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,465
Hey, let's ask Angela.

306
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:18,387
Man, I've been watching her a
whole week, and she is fucked up.

307
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:23,835
Now wait a second. You guys aren't
afraid to ask Angela, are you?

308
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:27,354
I think it might be kind of interesting
if Angela were around tonight.

309
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,048
Good. Then you ask her.

310
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:32,568
Oh, I would, but it wasn't my idea.

311
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:36,014
Hey, and who am I to steal
a buddy's great idea, huh?

312
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:39,600
Unless, of course,
you guys are... chicken!

313
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,981
Alright! Alright, we'll do it!

314
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,484
Who knows? We may get
married one day.

315
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:54,699
Nice shot.

316
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:58,886
Say, Angela. We're all going
down to the lake tonight.

317
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:04,642
You know, for a little swim. And, um,
we were kind of wondering if, well,

318
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:06,763
maybe if you wanted to
join us or something.

319
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,381
Let the pro take over.

320
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,474
Listen Angela, what say me and you go for a
little walk somewhere, talk about tonight, huh?

321
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:23,702
What's the matter, can't you talk?

322
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:27,081
I told you she was playing with
half a deck. Angela's a nut cake.

323
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:29,942
Ain't that right, Angela?
Ain't you Looney Tunes?

324
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:54,050
Hey Angela, how's this? Remind
you of anyone you know?

325
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:56,777
Yo, Angela. How come
you're so fucked up?

326
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,195
I mean, like, what's your problem?

327
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:00,030
Hey, dickface, leave her alone.

328
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:03,017
Oh yeah? What are you gonna
do about it, asshole?

329
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:22,761
You fucks! I'm gonna beat
your fucking asses in!

330
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,096
You and what army?

331
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:25,706
Oh, shut up and let's go.

332
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:26,999
Come on.

333
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,518
Pricks!

334
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,978
Shut your mouth,
will you, Mel's here?

335
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,438
I don't give a shit.

336
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,773
I think I'd better take you over to the
infirmary before your mouth gets you

337
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:36,108
into any more trouble.

338
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:38,819
- You alright?
- Yeah, I guess so.

339
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,988
Don't worry about it, Rick.
We'll get 'em back.

340
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:43,182
Come on, let's get out of here.

341
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:58,213
Hi. I'm Paul. Remember?

342
00:29:58,214 --> 00:30:00,616
I met you last week when
we all first got here.

343
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:07,165
Listen, I heard... Well, I mean,
Ricky told me all about it.

344
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:12,128
Well anyway, I'm really sorry about
what happened to your family.

345
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:15,731
Me and Ricky, we go
back a long time.

346
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:18,012
We've been best friends
for three years already.

347
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,980
We always seem to get
into trouble together.

348
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,515
Last year we hung the girls'
panties on the flagpole.

349
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:29,145
Sorry.

350
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:32,106
We got caught anyway.

351
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,358
Could be a lot of rocks.

352
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,280
Jerk.

353
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,825
Then there was this
time last year...

354
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:46,787
We locked Alan Weinstein out of
the cabin with no clothes on.

355
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:48,735
Boy, did we get it for that one.

356
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:56,005
Hey, bunk 19, time to go. Say
your goodnights and move out.

357
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:59,926
Guess I gotta go. Well,
goodnight, Angela.

358
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:06,432
Goodnight.

359
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:11,187
Good night!

360
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:28,537
Come on, girls!

361
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:32,375
Water's really warm at night.
What do you say, huh?

362
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:35,670
- I don't know, Billy.
- It's all very simple, right?

363
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,313
Why don't you start without us?

364
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:39,731
The hell with you, then!

365
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:42,134
You don't know how to
have any fun anyways.

366
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,928
Come on, boys.

367
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:52,353
- Come on, be serious.
- I am serious.

368
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:53,980
Woo!

369
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,335
Whoa!

370
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:01,445
Oh!

371
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:18,705
Any of you ladies interested
in a moonlight canoe ride?

372
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:22,133
Hey, come on. I won't try
anything, I promise.

373
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:24,510
How about it, Betsy?

374
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:27,263
No, I don't think so, Kenny.

375
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:29,740
Leslie's coming down soon.
Why don't you ask her?

376
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:32,143
Leslie's coming down?

377
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:35,521
Definitely, definitely.

378
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,523
Take it easy.

379
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:43,404
Have a good trip.

380
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:47,325
I don't like the way he said that.
Are you two planning something?

381
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:51,662
Relax, Leslie. You can trust me. Mike's
always screwing around like that.

382
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:08,346
The water really does
feel warmer at night.

383
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,614
Better not leave your
hand in there too long.

384
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:13,517
All the water snakes and snapping
turtles come out at night.

385
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,993
Yeah, sure.

386
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:18,230
Really! If you fall in,
you're gonna get eaten alive.

387
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:20,248
Hey, quit rockin' it, will you?

388
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:22,876
Why? You're not scared of a few
snakes and turtles, are you?

389
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:25,629
Kenny, stop it! I want to go back.

390
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:30,826
You know, if we fall in, we
may never be seen again!

391
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,704
You bastard! I hate you.

392
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:42,880
Hey, that's not a water snake
I see over there, is it?

393
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:57,202
Leslie...

394
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,814
Les-lie...

395
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:01,873
Hey!

396
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,192
Hey, you!

397
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,155
You guys are real schmucks.

398
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:16,513
Hey, Leslie! See any
water snakes out there?

399
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Woooo!
Hey, Bob-a-Ray-Bob.
Hey, hey, Bob-a-Ray-Bob.
What the hell are you doing here?

400
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:31,679
I bet the rest of the boys'll
be interested in seeing you.

401
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:38,160
Hey, Kenny! You scared
all the chicks away!

402
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:39,244
That's Kenny.

403
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:41,246
Love him and leave him.

404
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:43,957
Hey, we better beat it before all those
girls get caught and tell Ronnie we're

405
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,067
all down here.

406
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:47,377
Is this what's called getting
caught with your pants down?

407
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:51,282
Aw, you stupid shit.

408
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:53,784
Woo!

409
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:57,955
Kenny, let's go!

410
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:02,184
Come on, we're out of here!

411
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:04,519
Fuck him, Mike! He's
being a wise-ass again!

412
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,241
We'll catch him back at the bunk.

413
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:23,455
Why do I have to clean up after
these little peckerheads?

414
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:25,691
It's not my camp.

415
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:28,447
You'd think I didn't have
anything better to do!

416
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:32,448
These peckerheads suck!

417
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:37,036
How the hell did that get there?

418
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:44,851
Pick up this. Pick up that.
Clean this. Clean that.

419
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,837
Sign here, Mel.

420
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:51,066
I'd like to see Mel get his fat ass
down here and pick up something.

421
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,551
That cheap son of a...

422
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:18,994
As far as I can tell,
the boy drowned.

423
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:22,347
Of course, we'll have to wait for the
medical examiner to check him over

424
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:23,140
before we can be certain.

425
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:26,560
Of course he drowned. He was horsing
around, the canoe tipped over.

426
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:28,186
He must have hit his head.

427
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:30,981
I don't think so. Weren't any
bumps or bruises when I checked.

428
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:32,983
Though again, I'm no
expert on this matter.

429
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:36,862
It was obviously an accident. I mean, the
boy might have gotten scared and panicked.

430
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:37,888
Right?

431
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:39,573
That could be a logical explanation.

432
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:42,409
So it was one of those fluke accidents
we could not have foreseen,

433
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,952
and that is all there is to it!

434
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:46,154
- I don't know Mel, I...
- It was an accident!

435
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:50,834
I mean, that's what the
officer said, right?

436
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:53,362
I said the autopsy will
be more conclusive.

437
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:54,379
Right.

438
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,140
- You'll call me as soon as you know?
- You can count on it.

439
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:01,469
If you'll excuse me I have the unpleasant
task of informing the boy's parents.

440
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,455
Thank you for your help, officer.

441
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:09,211
The man doesn't take no
for an answer, does he?

442
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:11,396
I guess he's just uptight
about bad publicity.

443
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:13,382
Yeah, I guess so.

444
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:21,489
Hey, weren't you about to say something
just before he bit your head off?

445
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,644
I dunno. I was just thinking, I remember
that boy being a pretty damn good swimmer.

446
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:30,816
I sure hope you're wrong.

447
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:36,087
Alright, let's go. Everyone
back to their bunks.

448
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,568
Be ready for the morning
activity. Come on, let's go.

449
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:45,998
Nine, six.

450
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,959
Get it. Yeah!

451
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:54,590
Ten, six.

452
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:58,193
Hi-ya, Angela.

453
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:01,488
- How's it going?
- Okay. How's it going with you?

454
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:05,225
Could be better. Your cousin
just whipped me in tennis.

455
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,103
I was wondering...

456
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,360
Want to go to the movie
in the rec hall tonight?

457
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,292
I thought we had to go anyway.

458
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:17,738
Yeah, we do. But I meant
seeing it together.

459
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,286
So how about it? You want to go?

460
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:26,830
- Alright.
- Great!

461
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:31,627
Hey. How come Angela gets to
talk to the boys all day?

462
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:34,004
And we have to play volleyball.

463
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:37,216
What's she? Special?

464
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:40,844
It doesn't seem fair, does it?

465
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:50,062
- Aren't you supposed to be somewhere?
- I'm going.

466
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:52,622
- See you later, Angela.
- Bye.

467
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:53,707
Listen, Angela.

468
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:56,918
If you're not gonna participate
in our activities,

469
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,753
then you just sit
there and do nothing.

470
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:01,532
That does not include
talking with the boys.

471
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,925
You're not a goddamn
prima donna, you know?

472
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,927
Understand?

473
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:10,223
Big deal, she was talking to a boy.
Let's just finish the game

474
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:11,808
so we can get ready for lunch.

475
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,043
Yeah, let's.

476
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:18,507
- Are you sure you don't want to play?
- I'm sure.

477
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:23,011
Is there anything you would like
to do? Go sailing or something?

478
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:26,849
That's okay. I don't mind watching.

479
00:39:30,328 --> 00:39:32,813
Twelve, seven.

480
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,558
Mind if I walk you
back to your bunk?

481
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,835
I guess not.

482
00:39:57,897 --> 00:40:01,258
Gimme a break, will you?
Stop acting so stuck-up.

483
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:04,887
Remember all those good
times we had last summer?

484
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:08,114
What do you say, huh?
Let me walk you back?

485
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,142
Not tonight, Ricky.

486
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:19,437
- Where are we going?
- I want to show you something.

487
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:29,870
I hope you're not mad I did that.

488
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:33,306
I'm not mad. I better go in.

489
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:34,708
Can I have another one?

490
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,836
You know, another good night kiss?

491
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:44,009
I have to go now.

492
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:49,640
Good night, Angela.

493
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,433
Good night.

494
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:57,414
Hello, Paul.

495
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:58,690
How you doing, Judy?

496
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:01,777
You and Angela sure are
becoming quite an item.

497
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,195
So what?

498
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:05,364
I just didn't think
she was your type.

499
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:08,216
You know what I mean?

500
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:09,576
I gotta go.

501
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:18,810
Boy, did I have a great time tonight.

502
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:21,129
Shh! Shut up, or
you'll wake up Mozart.

503
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:23,966
What are you guys doing?

504
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:25,342
You'll see.

505
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:34,977
Go ahead, Baron.
But don't wake him up.

506
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,293
What the...?

507
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:45,420
What's the matter, Motz?
Five-o-clock shadow?

508
00:41:45,421 --> 00:41:47,322
You bastard!

509
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:50,300
Look out, man, he's got a knife!

510
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:51,827
I'm gonna kill you!

511
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:56,707
Uh-oh!

512
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:00,127
Hey!

513
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,963
What, are you guys kidding me?

514
00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:05,465
Are you nuts or something?

515
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:09,261
Gimme that. You'll see this at the
end of the summer, if you're lucky.

516
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:10,554
Idiot.

517
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:14,532
Come on, Gino, he was just kidding.

518
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:15,700
Give him a break.

519
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:17,702
Yeah. Gimme a break.

520
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:20,772
Maybe I should ask Ronnie
what he thinks I should do.

521
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:25,819
You'll see it at the end of the summer.
Right, now everybody into bed.

522
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:28,196
That includes you too, lover boy.

523
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:49,384
Guess who?

524
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,179
- Um, Ricky.
- Nope!

525
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:56,058
- Um... Burt Reynolds!
- You're getting warmer.

526
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:59,536
- I give up!
- Surprise!

527
00:42:59,537 --> 00:43:00,771
Who are you?

528
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:05,108
Well, well, if it isn't
the two lovebirds.

529
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:06,851
Why don't you get out of here?

530
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:08,487
Oh, sorry.

531
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:11,490
She's such a jerk
sometimes, isn't she?

532
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:28,882
Uh-oh. Here comes the
wicked witch of the West.

533
00:43:32,111 --> 00:43:34,028
I think I'm gonna go
back into the water.

534
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:35,514
Talk to you later, Angela.

535
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:43,772
Well, not going in the
water again, huh, Angela?

536
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:48,193
What's the matter?
Don't you like to swim?

537
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:50,654
Can you swim?

538
00:43:52,006 --> 00:43:56,910
Angela, I'm talking to you. Are you
going in the water or aren't you?

539
00:43:57,011 --> 00:43:58,036
Huh?!

540
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:03,433
Angela! I am waiting for an answer!

541
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:06,477
Yes or no?

542
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:10,523
Goddammit, answer me, Angela!
Answer me! Goddammit, answer me!

543
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:12,942
- What the hell is going on here?
- The little bitch won't answer me!

544
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:14,344
She never answers me!

545
00:44:14,737 --> 00:44:16,221
You alright, Angela?

546
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:18,948
Meg, I want to see you in my
shack right after swim period.

547
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:21,435
Now get back to your post.

548
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:39,119
Hey, girls.

549
00:44:39,136 --> 00:44:43,640
Let's not forget to thank Angela
for getting Meg in trouble.

550
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:45,375
I didn't do anything.

551
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:49,004
You never do shit.

552
00:44:55,444 --> 00:44:57,054
Give me that.

553
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:08,315
Hey, Angela.

554
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:14,529
How come you never take showers
when the rest of us do, huh?

555
00:45:17,216 --> 00:45:19,284
You queer or something?

556
00:45:20,636 --> 00:45:24,998
Oh, I know what it is. You
haven't reached puberty yet.

557
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,474
Is that it?

558
00:45:26,475 --> 00:45:28,768
I bet you don't even
have your period.

559
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:29,936
That's enough, Judy!

560
00:45:29,937 --> 00:45:33,632
Angela's allowed to shower in the
morning or any other time she wants to.

561
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:37,985
Yeah, she takes showers when no one
can see she has no hair down below.

562
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:40,863
- Judy!
- She's a real carpenter's dream!

563
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:43,449
Flat as a board and needs a screw!

564
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,268
- That's enough!
- Fuck off!

565
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:57,447
I'm going down to see my cousin.
I'll be back before dinner.

566
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:30,605
You fucking bastards are
gonna pay for this!

567
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:32,665
Cocksuckers! Pricks!

568
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,609
I'm gonna fight you, chickenshits!

569
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:42,550
- Angela!
- You chickenshits, you fucking pussies!

570
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:46,137
I'll kick your friggin asses all
over this goddamn camp, you fucks!

571
00:46:46,138 --> 00:46:50,266
Those pricks, I'll kill 'em!

572
00:46:50,267 --> 00:46:52,085
Take it easy already!

573
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:55,338
You boys come down from
there immediately.

574
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:09,494
Those cocksuckers keep
picking on my cousin.

575
00:47:09,495 --> 00:47:11,204
- That's bullshit.
- Enough.

576
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:13,231
I saw the whole business.

577
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:15,500
You realize how dangerous
those things are?

578
00:47:15,501 --> 00:47:17,694
You could have taken her eye out.

579
00:47:17,795 --> 00:47:19,420
Ronnie's gonna hear about this,

580
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:22,507
and there gonna be no
canteen for a whole week.

581
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:24,842
And that goes for you too on
account of your filthy mouth.

582
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:25,843
What?!

583
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:28,429
If I ever hear anything
like this again,

584
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,807
I'm gonna throw the whole
bunch of you out of here,

585
00:47:30,808 --> 00:47:32,751
and don't think I don't mean it.

586
00:47:35,354 --> 00:47:36,922
Get ready for dinner.

587
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:45,154
How do you feel, Angela? Alright?

588
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:46,447
She's okay.

589
00:47:46,448 --> 00:47:49,569
Better go change before you catch
pneumonia. It's almost time to eat.

590
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:19,814
Hey! What are you guys up to, huh?

591
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:22,441
We got a game against the
counselors. You gonna play?

592
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:23,860
Sure.

593
00:48:23,861 --> 00:48:26,696
I gotta take a wicked dump first, so
I'll see you guys down there, alright?

594
00:48:26,697 --> 00:48:29,099
Got it. See you later.

595
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:19,482
Who is that?

596
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:25,755
Oh, playing games? Is that
you, Benji? Jesus Christ.

597
00:49:25,756 --> 00:49:28,366
I can't even take a shit
in peace around here.

598
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:36,390
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, get that thing out of here!

599
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:38,251
Come on, get it out!

600
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:43,064
Come on! Get it out!
Get it out! No! No! No!

601
00:49:43,065 --> 00:49:45,274
Oh, God! Get away from me!

602
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:48,219
Get away! Get away from me!

603
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:51,948
Get away, get away! Somebody
help! Somebody help me!

604
00:49:51,949 --> 00:49:54,492
Help me!

605
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:56,311
Help me, somebody!

606
00:50:24,106 --> 00:50:25,882
I'm finished!

607
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:30,303
That's all there is to it.
Finished. Wiped out.

608
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:33,765
How many are left?

609
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:37,143
I'd say about twenty-five.

610
00:50:37,703 --> 00:50:39,870
We might as well pack
everything and shut down.

611
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:41,914
Nobody's ever gonna send
their kids here again.

612
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:45,084
Why don't we finish the summer, Mel?
Tomorrow I'll consolidate the bunks.

613
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:47,365
There's no sense in keeping
everyone spread out.

614
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:48,696
Yeah.

615
00:50:48,964 --> 00:50:50,756
Why make things easier
for the killer?

616
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:53,134
Hey, don't talk like that. We
don't know anything for sure yet.

617
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:56,955
I know! I've known all along.
I've seen the hate in his eyes.

618
00:50:57,472 --> 00:51:02,018
But I never did anything. Now,
I'll stop him for what he's done to me.

619
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:03,227
I'll stop him!

620
00:51:03,228 --> 00:51:06,005
Snap out of it, will you, Mel?
You're talking crazy.

621
00:51:06,148 --> 00:51:13,596
Yeah, maybe I am. Maybe
I'm just... imagining it.

622
00:51:19,453 --> 00:51:21,604
Maybe.

623
00:51:58,366 --> 00:52:00,451
Boo! Scared you, huh?

624
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:02,453
I thought you were the killer.

625
00:52:02,454 --> 00:52:05,372
Oh, come on. Don't tell me you
believe all that bologna.

626
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:07,458
Yeah, well what happened to Billy?

627
00:52:07,459 --> 00:52:09,859
Somebody was playing a joke
and it got out of hand.

628
00:52:09,878 --> 00:52:12,739
Now come on. Let's get out of
here before we get caught.

629
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:15,257
- Or murdered.
- Where are we going?

630
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:17,202
To the lake.

631
00:52:31,233 --> 00:52:33,968
Wait'll I get my hands on you!

632
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:50,000
No, don't.

633
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:53,696
Come on, Angela.
I'm not doing anything.

634
00:53:42,762 --> 00:53:43,830
No!

635
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:47,250
Angela!

636
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:49,669
Angela!

637
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:56,551
Okay, let me have your
attention for one minute.

638
00:53:56,651 --> 00:54:00,930
The last few days we've been using
the regular activity schedule.

639
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:02,448
And that bites the big one,

640
00:54:02,449 --> 00:54:04,992
so today we're going to try
something a little different, okay?

641
00:54:04,993 --> 00:54:07,745
Like in Color War, you're
gonna be separated into

642
00:54:07,746 --> 00:54:10,398
two groups and we're gonna
play capture the flag.

643
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:16,253
For you guys who have never played before,
Gene is going to explain the rules.

644
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:19,215
Alright, gangsters, listen up, because
this is going to be a lot of fun.

645
00:54:19,216 --> 00:54:22,134
Now, depending on what team you're on,
you're going to be wearing white strips

646
00:54:22,135 --> 00:54:25,638
or blue strips. The guys with the blue
strips have to capture the white flag,

647
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:27,806
and the guys with the white strips
have to capture the blue flag.

648
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:29,099
Sounds easy enough, right?

649
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,353
Now, to capture the flag you've got to
sneak into the other guy's territory.

650
00:54:32,354 --> 00:54:34,772
Capture his flag without getting
one of your strips taken off.

651
00:54:34,773 --> 00:54:39,052
First guy to capture the flag
wins, and that's about it.

652
00:54:43,823 --> 00:54:46,893
I still don't understand why you
got so upset about last night.

653
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:49,787
I wasn't doing anything
that bad, was I?

654
00:54:49,788 --> 00:54:54,583
I'm sorry, Paul. I just
wasn't ready. I just...

655
00:54:54,584 --> 00:54:57,836
- Hey, I understand.
- Please don't.

656
00:54:57,837 --> 00:54:59,739
What's the matter with you?

657
00:55:00,507 --> 00:55:02,450
I have to go.

658
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:04,952
Angela!

659
00:55:05,512 --> 00:55:08,164
- Angela!
- Let her go.

660
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:10,917
I really don't know why you
keep bothering with her.

661
00:55:11,268 --> 00:55:13,727
She's so small.

662
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:18,633
- What do you know?
- I know a lot of things.

663
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:34,148
Angela, you gotta help me. I got
a great plan to get the flag.

664
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:36,333
We cut through the woods
and sneak up behind them.

665
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:38,460
You go in one way and
I go in the other.

666
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:39,420
It can't miss!

667
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:42,699
- I don't feel like playing, Ricky.
- Oh, come on.

668
00:55:43,008 --> 00:55:44,383
Help me out, will you?

669
00:55:44,384 --> 00:55:46,119
I can't do it by myself.

670
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:47,537
Please?

671
00:55:48,096 --> 00:55:51,473
After we get the flag the game will be
over and you won't have to play anymore.

672
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:52,792
Okay?

673
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:56,546
- Alright, where do we have to go?
- Follow me.

674
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:14,621
The flag should be around
there, past those trees.

675
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:16,540
You go in from this side,
and I'll walk around

676
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,000
and attack from the other side.

677
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:19,960
They'll never be able
to catch both of us.

678
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:22,238
How do I know when to come out?

679
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:24,198
Good question.

680
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:25,799
Tell you what.

681
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,260
Give me about five minutes, and
when I see them run after you,

682
00:56:28,261 --> 00:56:29,996
I'll sneak out and grab the flag.

683
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:34,459
- I hope it works.
- No sweat, it's foolproof.

684
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:47,805
Come on. No one will see us.

685
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:50,516
Jesus, will you loosen up already?

686
00:56:55,246 --> 00:56:57,940
That wasn't so bad, was it?

687
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:59,901
I guess not.

688
00:57:06,716 --> 00:57:08,117
Angela!

689
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,286
Angela!

690
00:57:10,678 --> 00:57:13,414
Hey. Where are you going?

691
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:18,435
You're a real scumbag,
Judy, you know that?

692
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:20,171
Fuck you, Ricky.

693
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:22,089
You're just jealous.

694
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,884
Same to you.

695
00:57:45,338 --> 00:57:47,907
Mind if I sit here?

696
00:57:50,927 --> 00:57:55,973
Angela, I'm really sorry
about what happened before.

697
00:57:55,974 --> 00:57:57,917
I really am.

698
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:02,338
I don't know what happened.
She just wouldn't leave me alone.

699
00:58:05,108 --> 00:58:08,135
Come on, Angela. Please?

700
00:58:09,112 --> 00:58:11,764
Give me another chance, will you?

701
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:13,516
Please?

702
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:16,368
Back together so soon?

703
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:19,689
Boy, Angela, you
sure are forgiving.

704
00:58:20,165 --> 00:58:22,942
Especially after he told
me what a prude you are.

705
00:58:24,252 --> 00:58:27,196
That is the word you
used, isn't it, Paul?

706
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:30,199
I gotta go.

707
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:32,910
Bye, Paul.

708
00:58:34,888 --> 00:58:36,914
It's really no big deal, you know.

709
00:58:37,557 --> 00:58:39,542
I mean, he's okay for you.

710
00:58:41,811 --> 00:58:45,397
How about a little
swim, huh, Angela?

711
00:58:45,398 --> 00:58:51,470
What do you say we get that beautiful
bod of yours into the water, hmm?

712
00:58:56,493 --> 00:58:58,285
- Hello, Ricky.
- Hi, Mel.

713
00:58:58,286 --> 00:59:00,662
Seems we haven't had much
of a chance to talk.

714
00:59:00,663 --> 00:59:02,998
How's your summer been so far?

715
00:59:02,999 --> 00:59:05,610
- Alright, I guess.
- Just alright?

716
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:08,921
Well, it would have been better
if there were more guys around.

717
00:59:08,922 --> 00:59:11,048
It's kind of hard to get a
ball game up now, you know?

718
00:59:11,049 --> 00:59:12,450
Yeah.

719
00:59:13,176 --> 00:59:16,037
It is a shame so many had to leave.

720
00:59:17,055 --> 00:59:20,625
So how about it, Angela?
Let's go for a swim.

721
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:24,603
Oh, what's the matter? You afraid?

722
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:26,063
Huh?

723
00:59:26,064 --> 00:59:27,506
Huh?

724
00:59:28,149 --> 00:59:31,527
Well say something,
you spoiled little bitch!

725
00:59:31,528 --> 00:59:33,320
What's the problem?

726
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:36,198
My good friend Angela here

727
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:38,867
doesn't feel like going
in the water today.

728
00:59:38,868 --> 00:59:41,411
Oh, she doesn't, does she?

729
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:43,606
Well, I think I can fix that.

730
00:59:44,666 --> 00:59:47,668
No! Stop it! Let me down!

731
00:59:47,669 --> 00:59:51,797
Stop it! Please! Don't
throw me in the water!

732
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:53,783
Please, let me go!

733
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,135
With all this bad publicity, I don't
see how I can hold onto the camp.

734
00:59:57,136 --> 00:59:58,329
One sec...

735
00:59:58,805 --> 01:00:00,847
- I asked you a question!
- Hey, what are you doing?

736
01:00:00,848 --> 01:00:04,101
Just like all those other times. She gets
into trouble and you run to her rescue.

737
01:00:04,102 --> 01:00:05,435
You try to take care of everybody.

738
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:08,689
How you gonna do it this time? Another
drowning, or something worse?

739
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,107
What are you talking about?
Let me go!

740
01:00:10,108 --> 01:00:11,817
I saw you those times!

741
01:00:11,818 --> 01:00:14,403
In the rec room, at the water
fight, you killed them!

742
01:00:14,404 --> 01:00:17,848
Stop it! Don't throw
me in the water!

743
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:22,869
Stop, please! I don't
know how to swim!

744
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:27,749
You killed them to destroy me,
didn't you? Didn't you?!

745
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,444
Jesus Christ, Mel! What
the hell are you doing?

746
01:00:31,963 --> 01:00:34,156
Angela!

747
01:00:42,974 --> 01:00:44,375
Oh, poor baby.

748
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:49,880
You're a real peckerhead,
you know that, Meg?

749
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:56,236
Little fuckers!

750
01:00:56,237 --> 01:00:59,724
Hey! Animals! Knock it off!

751
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:10,584
Calm down, Angela. It's okay now.

752
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:12,778
Everything's gonna be alright.

753
01:01:12,837 --> 01:01:15,990
We won't let them get away
with this, that's for sure.

754
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:18,367
I promise we won't.

755
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:25,875
Okay, the only activity scheduled for
tonight is a social in the rec room.

756
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:28,226
Those on duty can start bringing
your kids up around nine,

757
01:01:28,227 --> 01:01:32,272
except for Eddie, who I've got some
bigger and better things planned.

758
01:01:32,273 --> 01:01:34,316
- A night off!
- Even better than that.

759
01:01:34,317 --> 01:01:36,234
Tonight you get to take those
little darlings of yours

760
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:38,262
on a camping trip on the lake.

761
01:01:39,364 --> 01:01:43,158
The campfire, sleeping under the
stars, bacon and eggs for breakfast.

762
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:45,243
- I can't wait.
- Okay.

763
01:01:45,244 --> 01:01:49,998
As for the rest of you, you're all on
tonight, except for... Let me see...

764
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:52,542
- Jerry and Meg. Any questions?
- Yea.

765
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:53,710
What's that?

766
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:54,961
Anybody want to switch?

767
01:01:54,962 --> 01:01:58,074
Sorry, Eddie. Have a
good evening, everybody.

768
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:05,097
- Boy, are you lucky.
- You ain't kidding.

769
01:02:05,098 --> 01:02:07,818
- I could sure use the night off.
- You and the rest of us.

770
01:02:08,351 --> 01:02:10,086
I'll see you later, okay?

771
01:02:13,231 --> 01:02:15,190
Hey, guess who has the
night off tonight?

772
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:17,093
Well, congratulations.

773
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:21,905
Listen, I was thinking... Remember
that dinner you promised me?

774
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:23,516
UP at your place?

775
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,356
Yeah. Nine, nine-thirty?

776
01:02:31,207 --> 01:02:33,317
You got it. See you then.

777
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:47,264
What are you so happy about?

778
01:02:47,265 --> 01:02:50,684
- Got me a date tonight.
- Oh yeah? With who?

779
01:02:50,685 --> 01:02:52,628
It's a secret.

780
01:02:57,692 --> 01:03:00,333
I don't suppose you guys would
let me go next, would you?

781
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:03,889
Didn't think so.

782
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:10,620
Hey, Jude! Jude! Jude!
Is the water still on next door?

783
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:12,898
- I guess so.
- Great.

784
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:14,400
See you later.

785
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

786
01:04:33,412 --> 01:04:36,190
Hey, no fighting back there.

787
01:04:39,043 --> 01:04:40,903
Okay, guys, let's go.

788
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:48,160
You guys got all that stuff out
of the car, right? Hey, quit it!

789
01:04:49,846 --> 01:04:51,304
Give me that.

790
01:04:51,305 --> 01:04:54,208
- This isn't a toy!
- I wasn't doing anything!

791
01:04:54,851 --> 01:04:59,145
Look, guys, you set up and I'll go
get some wood for the fire, ok?

792
01:04:59,146 --> 01:05:00,506
Can I come, Eddie?

793
01:05:00,857 --> 01:05:02,591
What are you, my shadow?

794
01:05:04,861 --> 01:05:07,012
Alright. Alright.
Come on, let's go.

795
01:05:20,585 --> 01:05:21,944
Hi.

796
01:05:23,713 --> 01:05:25,322
Do you know where Ricky is?

797
01:05:26,299 --> 01:05:28,284
He's back at the bunk lying down.

798
01:05:28,301 --> 01:05:31,578
Said he didn't feel good after
dinner, but he might come by later.

799
01:05:32,513 --> 01:05:34,039
Look, Angela.

800
01:05:34,765 --> 01:05:39,169
I'm really sorry about what
I did. I know I was wrong.

801
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:41,313
Can't you forgive
me just this once?

802
01:05:41,314 --> 01:05:42,840
Please?

803
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:45,483
I didn't mean what
I said about you.

804
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:47,261
I was just pissed off.

805
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:49,613
I swear it.

806
01:05:49,614 --> 01:05:51,531
Excuse us, kids.

807
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:54,643
Don't they make a lovely couple.

808
01:05:56,954 --> 01:05:58,814
I really hate that girl.

809
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:05,253
Please, Angela. I'm really sorry.

810
01:06:05,254 --> 01:06:07,156
You know I am.

811
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,533
Please forgive me.

812
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:12,411
Please?

813
01:06:15,723 --> 01:06:18,542
Meet me at the waterfront
after the social.

814
01:06:20,061 --> 01:06:21,378
I'll be there.

815
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:36,268
Eddie.

816
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:39,229
Eddie, I'm cold.

817
01:06:39,455 --> 01:06:41,774
- Eddie!
- What do you want?

818
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:44,985
I want to go back. I'm cold!

819
01:06:45,628 --> 01:06:48,713
- Forget it.
- Eddie!

820
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:53,035
- Please, Eddie, I want to go back.
- I want to come too!

821
01:06:56,097 --> 01:06:58,723
You guys are really pains
in my ass, you know that?

822
01:06:58,724 --> 01:07:00,376
Please?

823
01:07:03,145 --> 01:07:05,964
Alright. Up to the car.

824
01:07:58,325 --> 01:07:59,284
Susie?

825
01:07:59,285 --> 01:08:00,702
Have you seen Meg anywhere?

826
01:08:00,703 --> 01:08:02,620
- She's off tonight, Mel.
- Yeah, I know.

827
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:04,748
She was supposed to meet
me about an hour ago.

828
01:08:04,749 --> 01:08:06,207
Did you check the bunk?

829
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:07,542
Not yet.

830
01:08:07,543 --> 01:08:10,946
If you see her, tell her I'm looking
for her. Will you, please?

831
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:24,877
- Do you have to kiss so wet?
- Sorry.

832
01:08:31,692 --> 01:08:33,802
Quick. Under the bed.

833
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,310
- Hi, Mel.
- Hey,

834
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:43,995
You're not going to the
social tonight, eh?

835
01:08:43,996 --> 01:08:46,498
I'm a little tired, so I thought
I might get to bed early.

836
01:08:46,499 --> 01:08:49,918
Oh, yeah? I'm looking for
Meg, have you seen her?

837
01:08:49,919 --> 01:08:53,088
The last time I saw Meg, she was
going next door to take a shower.

838
01:08:53,089 --> 01:08:55,324
- When was that?
- I don't know.

839
01:08:55,549 --> 01:08:56,909
After dinner sometime.

840
01:08:58,803 --> 01:09:00,245
Alright, thanks.

841
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:07,169
You know, you could ruin your eyes
reading in the dark like that.

842
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:19,781
Look. I think I'd better beat it.

843
01:09:19,782 --> 01:09:20,615
What?

844
01:09:20,616 --> 01:09:22,033
You just got here!

845
01:09:22,034 --> 01:09:23,701
I don't know, I just don't
want to get caught.

846
01:09:23,702 --> 01:09:26,037
Cut the crap, Mike. He won't
be back and you know it.

847
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:28,540
You never know. Look,
I'll see you tomorrow.

848
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:30,067
Don't bet on it.

849
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:32,736
Chickenshit.

850
01:09:57,486 --> 01:09:58,762
Meg?

851
01:10:01,073 --> 01:10:02,724
Are you in there?

852
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

853
01:10:20,593 --> 01:10:22,369
Oh my God.

854
01:10:22,803 --> 01:10:25,414
Not you, Meg.

855
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:30,185
He did this to get back at me!

856
01:10:30,186 --> 01:10:33,813
I had him. I had him
and let him go.

857
01:10:33,814 --> 01:10:37,050
Forgive me, Meg, please forgive me.

858
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,137
I'll stop him.

859
01:10:40,154 --> 01:10:42,055
I've got to stop him!

860
01:10:43,449 --> 01:10:45,434
He won't get away, Meg.

861
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:49,062
He'll never get away from me again.

862
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,971
Mike?

863
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:08,248
Is that you?

864
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:16,506
Who is that?

865
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:24,113
Well, whoever it is,
don't turn the light on,

866
01:11:24,114 --> 01:11:26,350
or we'll have to go
to the stupid social.

867
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,549
Oh, it's you. What do you want?

868
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:45,744
Well?

869
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

870
01:13:19,563 --> 01:13:21,089
Help.

871
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:24,176
Somebody.

872
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:27,262
Help.

873
01:13:29,865 --> 01:13:32,768
Help! Help!

874
01:13:33,285 --> 01:13:35,437
Somebody help!

875
01:13:42,294 --> 01:13:45,129
Wait a minute. Where do
you think you're going?

876
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:47,840
- Inside, to get something to eat.
- Oh, no. The social's over.

877
01:13:47,841 --> 01:13:48,883
Get back to your bunk.

878
01:13:48,884 --> 01:13:49,842
Give me a break, huh?

879
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:52,553
I've been lying down all night
because dinner made me sick.

880
01:13:52,554 --> 01:13:54,998
Just let me grab
something real quick.

881
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,209
Well, dinner was shitty.

882
01:13:57,893 --> 01:14:00,045
- Just make it snappy.
- Thanks, Jeff.

883
01:14:22,835 --> 01:14:24,293
Hello?

884
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:26,488
Speaking.

885
01:14:26,922 --> 01:14:28,114
What?

886
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:30,325
Oh, God, no.

887
01:14:32,344 --> 01:14:33,745
Three of them?

888
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,791
Listen, I'll get them now.
Right now, I will.

889
01:14:38,684 --> 01:14:40,017
I just don't believe it, though.

890
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:43,563
I gotcha now, you little
monster. Now it's my turn!

891
01:14:43,564 --> 01:14:45,773
Get the fuck off of me!
Leave me alone!

892
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:49,970
You killed that Benny and
Billy just like you left Meg!

893
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:52,447
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

894
01:14:52,448 --> 01:14:53,849
I didn't do nothing!

895
01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:56,977
Stop it! I didn't do
anything, you crazy fuck!

896
01:14:57,828 --> 01:14:59,954
Stop it! I didn't do nothing!

897
01:14:59,955 --> 01:15:02,816
Liar! Liar! Liar!

898
01:15:05,002 --> 01:15:08,087
Marie, find all the counselors and have
them meet me in my shack right away.

899
01:15:08,088 --> 01:15:09,130
I'll go get the ones below.

900
01:15:09,131 --> 01:15:10,811
- What happened?
- Just get them!

901
01:15:11,967 --> 01:15:15,453
Liar!

902
01:15:17,764 --> 01:15:22,018
I got him. Just like
I promised Meg.

903
01:15:22,019 --> 01:15:23,879
I got him.

904
01:15:26,356 --> 01:15:28,091
Wait.

905
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:30,969
I gotta get away.

906
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It can't be you.
It can't be!
It can't be!

907
01:15:58,138 --> 01:16:00,389
- I filled them all in.
- Alright, great.

908
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,475
Now I suggest you send
them all back to their kids

909
01:16:02,476 --> 01:16:04,685
to make sure everyone stays inside.

910
01:16:04,686 --> 01:16:07,313
- Angela and Judy are missing.
- Oh, no.

911
01:16:07,314 --> 01:16:09,106
- What's all the fuss?
- There's a killer loose.

912
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:11,359
Make sure no one leaves
your bunk for any reason.

913
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,902
Paul and Ricky haven't
come back yet.

914
01:16:12,903 --> 01:16:14,237
We'd better go look
for them right now.

915
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:15,446
Everybody out in pairs.

916
01:16:15,447 --> 01:16:17,949
Look everywhere you can think
of, even the empty cabins.

917
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,143
Let me get my flashlight.

918
01:16:42,057 --> 01:16:43,857
I didn't think you were gonna show.

919
01:16:47,521 --> 01:16:49,923
- Let's go swimming.
- Now?

920
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:53,677
- What about our clothes?
- Take them off.

921
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,221
OK!

922
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,845
Found one.

923
01:17:39,197 --> 01:17:40,682
Ricky.

924
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:47,230
Hey, he's alive!

925
01:18:03,472 --> 01:18:04,998
It's Meg.

926
01:18:05,057 --> 01:18:07,459
It's so horrible!

927
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:33,443
Angela!

928
01:18:33,585 --> 01:18:35,070
Judy!

929
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:38,323
Ricky, Paul! You guys out here?

930
01:18:39,633 --> 01:18:41,409
Hey. You hear something?

931
01:18:42,094 --> 01:18:44,245
- What?
- Listen.

932
01:18:44,971 --> 01:18:46,831
Sounds like singing.

933
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,795
Damn it. It's coming
from over here.

934
01:18:59,194 --> 01:19:00,637
It's Angela!

935
01:19:01,071 --> 01:19:03,765
Angela! Are you alright?

936
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:08,103
Angela! Are you okay?

937
01:19:09,121 --> 01:19:11,022
Angela, can you hear me?

938
01:19:18,088 --> 01:19:21,132
Oh, you're going to enjoy
living with us so much!

939
01:19:21,133 --> 01:19:22,758
Yes, I know you are.

940
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:26,887
As a welcome-home present I bought
you such wonderful new clothes.

941
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:30,641
I just hope that Richard doesn't get
jealous that I didn't get him anything.

942
01:19:30,642 --> 01:19:35,046
Oh, but then he is such a dear.
I'm sure that he won't mind.

943
01:19:35,063 --> 01:19:37,982
You see, I've always
wanted a little girl.

944
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,693
But of course, when
my husband left...

945
01:19:40,694 --> 01:19:41,902
Oh, well!

946
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:44,613
That's all water under the
bridge, as I always say.

947
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:46,615
Water under the bridge.

948
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:50,161
But it certainly will be a nice little
surprise when Richard comes home

949
01:19:50,162 --> 01:19:52,188
to find a little girl in the house.

950
01:19:52,581 --> 01:19:57,944
Yes, I've always dreamed of a
little girl just like you.

951
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:00,379
I mean, we already have a boy.

952
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:05,259
So another one simply would not do.
Oh, no, absolutely not.

953
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:09,747
A little girl would be so much nicer.
Don't you think so, Angela?

954
01:20:10,182 --> 01:20:11,932
Angela...

955
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:14,169
Such a lovely name.

956
01:20:15,187 --> 01:20:17,271
Why, I believe it means "angel."

957
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Why, yes. I'm sure it does.
I know you're going
to like that name.
Won't you, Peter?

958
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:30,894
How can it be?

959
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:38,151
My God, she's a boy.
