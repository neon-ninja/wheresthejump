You're under arrest.

28
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,753
Get on your knees.

29
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,964
I didn't do anything.

30
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,091
Hands! Hands! Hands!

31
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,678
William, I know I told you
to take out the laundry.

32
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,480
- Billy, where you going?
- Laundry.

33
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,858
- Oh, can you do mine?
- No.

34
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,029
I hope Sherman gets you.

35
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,460
If you see him, let us know.

36
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,086
We don't need him scaring
any more kids, all right?

37
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,112
And that's the lowdown. Them kids.

38
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,864
They're still looking for him.

39
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,369
Just don't get out after dark. You know?

40
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,703
That's what I said.

41
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:28,352
Suspicious noise from inside the building.
We're gonna check it out.

42
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,237
- You nervous?
- What?

43
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,614
You're doing that thing with the bottle,
with your hands.

44
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,158
- Are you a little fidgety?
- No. No.

45
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,785
- Yeah.
- Are you nervous?

46
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,579
No, I want to become best friends
with your sister.

47
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,082
See? How would you feel about that?

48
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,626
- I'm fine.
- Uh-huh.

49
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,592
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

50
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,430
What is this wine? Walgreens?
Rothschild's?

51
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,766
We have a moscato in the fridge,
if that's more your taste.

52
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,811
I think Postmates delivers wine.

53
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,521
Is this one of yours?

54
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,940
Yes. Very old piece.

55
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,234
He hates that I put that up there.

56
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:26,405
- At some point, you gotta move on.
- Except that you haven't though, right,

57
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,157
made a piece in, what, two years?

58
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,452
It's just that you're my muse,
and I don't see you often enough, Troy.

59
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,121
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

60
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,290
- Oh, my gosh, stop. You are too much.
- Hmm?

61
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,499
- Thank you.
- Brat.

62
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,625
- Let it breathe.
- Shut up.

63
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,961
He's still salty we didn't use him
as our realtor.

64
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,087
- As you can tell.
- Mm-hmm.

65
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,965
- Horrible. How can you stand that?
- No, no, no, sweetie.

66
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,884
You don't know the first thing
about Chicago real estate.

67
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,218
He must like you,

68
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,596
because he's really showing his ass.

69
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,307
- Isn't he always?
- You overpaid, Bri.

70
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,475
It's not just the inside that counts.

71
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,644
- It's close to the gallery.
- Yeah, it's very practical.

72
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,771
- Okay, what is wrong with it?
- Nothing.

73
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,356
As I told my sister many times,

74
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,942
- the neighborhood is haunted.
- Everywhere is haunted.

75
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,069
- Troy, do not start with that.
- Sure, sure, sure,

76
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,447
but why choose a place
that used to be called Smokey Hollow?

77
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,450
Then, Little Hell, then what is it?
Combat Alley?

78
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,785
- What's it called now?
- Cabrini-Green.

79
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,913
It was the projects.

80
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,540
It was affordable housing
that had a particularly bad reputation.

81
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,001
- You would never know.
- Because they tore it down

82
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,628
and gentrified the shit out of it.

83
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:26,673
Translation: White people built the ghetto
and then erased it

84
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,675
when they realized they built the ghetto.

85
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,761
- Oh, no offense.
- None taken.

86
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,304
They took the opportunity
to make it livable.

87
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,972
I could've got you a better conversion.

88
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,100
They kept telling people
they were gonna make it better,

89
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,895
moving 'em from place to place,
but they were just tearing it down,

90
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,773
so they could develop
everything around it.

91
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,358
Oh, like here.

92
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,572
You guys want to hear a scary story?

93
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,992
- No.
- Too bad.

94
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,707
But I voted no.

95
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:01,959
- Troy…
- Uh-oh.

96
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,503
Oh, my gosh.

97
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,880
Really?

98
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,978
This shit better be good.

99
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,649
This is a story

100
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,776
about a woman named Helen Lyle.

101
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,821
She was a grad student,
a white grad student,

102
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,615
doing her thesis
on the urban legends of Cabrini-Green.

103
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,704
<i>For research, she came down
to Cabrini a few times, you know?</i>

104
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:43,000
<i>Asking questions,
taking pictures of graffiti, of people.</i>

105
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,168
<i>And then,</i>

106
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,253
<i>one day,</i>

107
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,380
<i>she just…</i>

108
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,841
<i>…snaps.</i>

109
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,511
<i>She beheaded a Rottweiler.</i>

110
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,096
<i>By the time the police show up,</i>

111
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,309
<i>she's in one of the apartments,
doing snow angels in a pool of blood.</i>

112
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,643
- Ew.
- Bullshit.

113
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,270
- Troy.
- Bullshit.

114
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,272
- Where do you get this?
- She killed a Rottweiler?

115
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,982
This is extra, even for you.

116
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,317
There are articles written about this.

117
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,818
Look it up.

118
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:11,945
The authorities take her in,

119
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,614
but she escapes almost immediately.

120
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,075
<i>She goes on a rampage,</i>

121
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,412
<i>leaving a trail of bodies
in her wake and then,</i>

122
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,539
<i>the baby of one of the residents…</i>

123
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:23,707
<i>…is abducted.</i>

124
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,461
<i>The mother is devastated.
Everyone is looking for him,</i>

125
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,254
and nothing.

126
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,549
<i>On the night of the annual bonfire,</i>

127
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,052
<i>with all of the residents
of Cabrini watching…</i>

128
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,471
<i>…Helen arrives…</i>

129
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,557
<i>with a sacrificial offering.</i>

130
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,145
Baby in her arms,
she runs towards the fire,

131
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,647
<i>but they're on her, quick.</i>

132
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,400
They say she was in a fugue state,
fighting back blindly.

133
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,402
But they got the baby free.

134
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,905
<i>While everyone is fussing over him,</i>

135
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,740
<i>Helen stands up,</i>

136
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,369
<i>and walks right into the fire.</i>

137
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,455
And it's on that spot that she dies,

138
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:08,335
<i>burns to death,
right in the middle of Cabrini-Green.</i>

139
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,340
Is my rosé still in the freezer?

140
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,593
You don't want the moscato?

141
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,264
Moscato's a dessert wine.

142
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,518
- Bye, Bri-Bri.
- Love you.

143
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,353
- Nice to meet you.
- And, Anthony, get painting!

144
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,647
My sister's not trying to support you
the rest of her life.

145
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,649
Put down those weights,
pick up them brushes.

146
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,942
- Troy…
- Come on.

147
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,403
He's funny.

148
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,281
He is ridiculous.

149
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,532
He is right.

150
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,584
I'm just glad Troy's
finally dating someone normal.

151
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:54,298
I was getting exhausted trying to keep up
with all those European fashion designers.

152
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,216
Hello?

153
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,053
What time is Clive coming tomorrow?

154
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,471
10:00 a.m.

155
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,766
You feeling good
about what you're showing?

156
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,603
Uh, I think so.

157
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,521
Uh…

158
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,190
Some stuff he might enjoy.

159
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,400
Mm-hmm.

160
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,569
Okay, okay.

161
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,197
Huh.

162
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,700
I guess she did kill a Rottweiler.

163
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,910
Damn.

164
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,037
I don't care.

165
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,624
I'm not trying to get creeped out
in my new apartment before bed.

166
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,419
Your new apartment is ghost-proof.

167
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,839
- It was on the Zillow listing.
- Our new apartment.

168
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,216
Mm-hmm.

169
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,383
Sorry.

170
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,055
Come here.

171
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,645
Hmm.

172
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,355
Who are you, man?

173
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:54,691
Uh, well…

174
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,945
This is Anthony McCoy
of two years ago.

175
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,739
I want the Anthony McCoy of the future.

176
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:04,201
I want the great Black hope
of the Chicago art scene of tomorrow.

177
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,080
That's the guy that I gave a solo show to
straight out of grad school.

178
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,792
Look, I really don't want
to have to go through

179
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,836
the trouble of replacing you
in the summer show,

180
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,798
but you're the only person
who hasn't shown me what I'm putting up!

181
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,262
- I'm working on something.
- Dig into that history of yours, dude!

182
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,848
I'm thinking about doing something
about the projects.

183
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,768
- And about how white supremacy…
- White people.

184
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,563
Yeah, how it creates these spaces

185
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,606
of rampant neglect
for communities of color,

186
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,733
- in particular, Black communities.
- Yeah, like where you're from.

187
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,945
- Yeah. Bronzeville.
- South Side is kind of played.

188
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,866
Uh, or Cabrini-Green.

189
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,162
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.

190
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,540
Bye, babe.

191
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,542
- Don't forget we have your mom's tonight.
- 7:00.

192
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,505
Bye.

193
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,839
They'd almost never come
round here back in the day.

194
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,758
Unless it was to take someone in.

195
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,636
But that was a long time ago.

196
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,764
Now they can't seem to stay away.

197
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:38,684
At night, they post up where
the last of us still live,

198
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,520
a police car on either side of the block.

199
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,230
Keeping us safe…

200
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,149
or keeping us in.

201
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,361
You've lived around here for a while?

202
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:53,073
Uh, since before the high-rises came down.

203
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,158
William. William Burke.

204
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,535
Anthony McCoy.

205
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:00,789
You need a hand?

206
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,251
Home sweet home.

207
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,464
Ah, the more things change,
the more things stay the same.

208
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,049
How you doing, brother?

209
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:14,803
Ask the white people around here
about "Girl X," Dantrell Davis.

210
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:16,013
Blank stares.

211
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,725
One white woman dies in the hood,
and the story lives on forever.

212
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,518
It's a good story, I guess.

213
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,687
You mind if I take some notes?

214
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:31,111
Makes you think about what could make
someone just snap like that.

215
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,947
Helen Lyle was out here
looking for Candyman.

216
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:36,533
You ask me, I say she found him.

217
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:39,953
What's Candyman?

218
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,876
<i>For me, Candyman
was a guy named Sherman Fields.</i>

219
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,337
<i>He had a hook for a hand.</i>

220
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,421
<i>Neighborhood character.</i>

221
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:52,508
<i>Used to stand there
and hand out sweets when I was a kid.</i>

222
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:54,593
<i>One October,</i>

223
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,847
a razor blade shows up
in a little white girl's Halloween candy.

224
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:02,017
Police come around looking for Sherman,
but Sherman's gone.

225
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:07,231
And one day, I saw him myself.

226
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,451
<i>He'd been hiding in the walls.</i>

227
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,377
We got a suspicious noise…

228
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,922
That's when I saw the true face of fear.

229
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,760
Come on, come on.
Go, go, go!

230
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,470
Go, go! Come on, let's go!

231
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,370
Hurry! Come on, go, go, go!

232
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,011
Over here.

233
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,555
Get out of here! Come on!

234
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,229
<i>They swarmed him.</i>

235
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,238
<i>Killed him right there on the spot.</i>

236
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,959
What shows up a couple weeks later?

237
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,755
More razor blades in more candy.

238
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:59,551
That's when we knew
Sherman had been innocent.

239
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,053
Harmless.

240
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,806
But that wasn't the last we saw of him.

241
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,487
I don't know what to tell you.

242
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,447
Beshaw dropped out of my show.

243
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:07,119
Oh, I told you months ago
to put her in rehab.

244
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,705
You fix this.

245
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,504
Uh.

246
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:20,799
Uh-huh.

247
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,509
Uh-huh. Okay.

248
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,054
What's up?

249
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,267
- You forgot your mother's.
- Shit. I'm sorry.

250
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,269
Will you please call that woman?

251
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,354
- Tomorrow.
- You said that yesterday.

252
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,356
And it's nice that she wants
to spend time with you.

253
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,816
Not everyone has that.

254
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,861
Is she okay?

255
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:44,198
She implied that I give you money
so you won't visit her.

256
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,618
So, she's about the same.

257
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,828
- Stop it.
- That's great.

258
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:51,330
I wanna show you something.

259
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,332
Uh…

260
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:57,002
- Do I need to come upstairs?
- Stay right there.

261
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,046
All righty then.

262
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:03,342
Sherman's face was beaten
so badly that it was unrecognizable,

263
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:06,011
and that's where the story started.

264
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:09,014
About them seeing him around Cabrini.

265
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,933
About him coming to get you.

266
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,772
Over time, his name disappears,
and he just becomes the Candyman.

267
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:19,483
What do you think?

268
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,109
Well…

269
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,945
it's a pretty literal approach.

270
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,198
Not much room for viewer
interpretation, you know.

271
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:30,035
Moving from the symbolism of violence
to the actual depiction of it.

272
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,996
Okay, but how is it hitting you?

273
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,498
It's…

274
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,917
painful.

275
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:41,046
I feel really connected to this.
I've never been this clear before.

276
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:45,676
It's like I know exactly
what I'm meant to be doing right now.

277
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:50,013
Babe, that's great.

278
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,894
- And I'm sure Clive will be...
- Oh, there's one more thing.

279
00:23:56,728 --> 00:24:00,107
The legend is
if you say his name five times

280
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,650
while looking in the mirror,

281
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:05,571
he appears in the reflection
and kills you.

282
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,449
So, I thought

283
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,827
that we could…

284
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,412
What did you think?

285
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,289
Summon him.

286
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:18,166
Hell no.

287
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:20,794
No.

288
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:22,337
Candyman.

289
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:23,672
Anthony…

290
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:26,508
- Candyman.
- Anthony, no.

291
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:28,760
- Candyman.
- Stop. Stop it.

292
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,387
- Candyman.
- Stop it!

293
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,597
Okay.

294
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,057
- You better not do that last one.
- Okay, okay, okay.

295
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,147
- Candyman.
- Anthony, you play too much!

296
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,565
Stop, stop, stop.

297
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,442
What happened to your hand?

298
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,777
- Fucking bee sting.
- Really?

299
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,279
Yeah, that shit hurt.

300
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,615
Mmm. Looks like it.

301
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,867
- Kiss it.
- Get the fuck outta here.

302
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:54,453
Help, help.

303
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,176
- We can go now.
- Finally.

304
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:38,307
Last year, we did a solo booth
at Frieze LA with Jameson.

305
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,725
Phenomenal work.

306
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,018
These are related works,

307
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:46,231
but here, he's recreating
and looping archival footage.

308
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,443
Just take your time.

309
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,746
This is quite a departure
from your previous work.

310
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,166
Go ahead, open it.

311
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:16,470
I'm trying to align these moments in time
that exist in the same place.

312
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:19,223
The idea is to almost

313
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:23,769
calibrate tragedy into a focused lineage
that culminates in the now.

314
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,106
Brianna,
tell your boy not to hog the critic.

315
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,944
He's got a whole thing.

316
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:36,573
Yeah, no, I know, I heard it.
It's complicated.

317
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:40,410
She's interacting with the piece.

318
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:43,914
The mirror invites you
to attempt the summoning yourself.

319
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:46,583
Huh.

320
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:51,713
Anyway, I don't know why
I'm standing next to my own piece

321
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:53,674
like some kind of asshole.

322
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:57,928
- The work speaks for itself.
- Oh, it speaks, all right.

323
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:01,431
It speaks in didactic knee-jerk clichés

324
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:04,852
about the ambient violence
of the gentrification cycle.

325
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:09,731
But your kind are the real pioneers
of that cycle, you know.

326
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:11,149
Excuse me?

327
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:13,527
Artists.

328
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:18,323
Artists descend upon
disenfranchised neighborhoods

329
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:21,201
divining cheap rent, so they can
dick around in their studios

330
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,662
without the crushing burden of a day job.

331
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:27,082
I'm gonna get another drink.

332
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:38,135
- Should we try it?
- What?

333
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,803
Summon the Candyman?

334
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:43,140
Uh, yeah, no. Black people don't need
to be summoning shit.

335
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:46,226
- Come on, that is nonsense.
- This isn't the bayou.

336
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,187
In Chicago, that's white people shit.

337
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,563
Mmm.

338
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,900
- Candyman. Candyman.
- Zip it. Hey, stop.

339
00:28:58,655 --> 00:28:59,865
- Candyman.
- Stop it.

340
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:07,372
Of course, I did. I owe Brianna one.

341
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,667
She introduced me to Thelma Golden
three years ago.

342
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:13,212
You still owe me one for that.

343
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:14,588
And, uh…

344
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:15,881
Ah…

345
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,382
Tony, is it?

346
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:20,219
I love interventionist strategy.

347
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:23,305
Conventional painting is such a drag.

348
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,057
I love that you hid those fucking things

349
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,351
in a storage room
with the lights out. So smart.

350
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,603
Is all your work based on found material?

351
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,647
I mean, where'd you
even find those paintings?

352
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,023
Thrift store in the desert?

353
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:37,528
I found them in the studio
where I painted them.

354
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,572
You goofy-ass fuck.

355
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,243
And you, you fucking hyenas.

356
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:46,453
- Oh, what the fuck?
- Hey. Let's go. Clive.

357
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,915
- Anthony.
- You think you'd even be here

358
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:51,083
if it wasn't for her?

359
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,168
Shouldn't you be stocking up
on morning-after pills

360
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:55,045
to accommodate your summer intern program?

361
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,923
That's not spontaneous.
You had that one in the bank.

362
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,675
Yeah, I did, bitch.

363
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:04,137
That's fine.
I can take being called a bitch.

364
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:07,516
- It's fine. I'm on a NuvaRing.
- I know.

365
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:10,435
Thanks for coming.

366
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:38,547
I'm so fucking over it.

367
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,216
Honestly, if she can't control her man…

368
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,593
She lost control.

369
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:45,387
It's like, do I get a thank you? No!

370
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,307
Do I get an apology for that display?

371
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,267
Atrocity exhibition.

372
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:55,772
Shoehorning her boyfriend
into my summer show was her first mistake.

373
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:57,941
- Only mistake.
- She's done.

374
00:30:58,025 --> 00:31:00,152
And she has no one to blame but herself.

375
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:03,071
Don't mix curation
with who you're fucking.

376
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,782
Love will tear us apart.

377
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:08,327
Jesus, Jerrica, we get it.
You like Joy Division.

378
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:17,002
- What's that thing again?
- What thing?

379
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:19,546
You know.

380
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,716
Say what five times in the mirror?

381
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,968
You tell me.

382
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:27,387
You proofread the press release, Jerrica.

383
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:29,681
"Candyman."

384
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:34,269
But don't do it, okay?

385
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:36,939
I don't want you to die tonight.

386
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,651
At least, not until we…

387
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:42,444
fuck.

388
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:45,614
You're no good for me.

389
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:47,950
You know what? I changed my mind. Do it.

390
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:49,826
Necrophilia's always been
on my bucket list.

391
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,078
Mmm.

392
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,040
Mmm.

393
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:57,668
Hmm.

394
00:31:57,751 --> 00:31:59,044
Let's do it here then.

395
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,712
Um.

396
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:03,298
- No, I've been here all day.
- Come on.

397
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:12,683
Mmm.

398
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:16,937
- Candyman.
- Are you serious?

399
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,188
Quiet, bitch.

400
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,489
Candyman.

401
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,658
Candyman.

402
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,288
- Candyman.
- Mmm.

403
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:35,706
Candyman.

404
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:54,308
<i>See?</i>

405
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Nothing.
So much for that.

406
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:07,946
Is this real?

407
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:11,742
This is real?

408
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:13,118
What the fuck?

409
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,788
What the fuck!

410
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:24,004
Hello?

411
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,141
What…

412
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:45,651
…the fuck?

413
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:53,909
Oh!

414
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:55,452
Fuck!

415
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:59,206
Fuck me. Must go faster.

416
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,333
Must go faster!

417
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:09,800
Fuck!

418
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,302
Fuck! No!

419
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:15,389
No! No!

420
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:19,643
Stop! Stop! Stop!

421
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,603
Help! No! No!

422
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,858
Fucking assholes.

423

They said my name.

And <i>Say My Name.</i>

430
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,001
I don't know, just…

431
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:11,129
It's cool to be mentioned, I guess.

432
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:17,094
I mean, obviously…

433
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:20,180
Obviously, it's... Obviously, it's awful.

434
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,057
Really?

435
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,035
Clive?

436
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:47,249
Dad?

437
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,006
Why are you sitting there?

438
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:58,468
Hey.

439
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:03,473
I bet you didn't know
your daddy could fly.

440
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:05,517
Did you?

441
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:09,813
Well, I can.

442
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:41,512
Anthony?

443
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,981
Anthony?

444
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:56,860
Are you okay?

445
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:00,572
I had a bad dream.

446
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:02,449
Me too.

447
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:05,118
What was it?

448
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:07,913
What was what?

449
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:10,374
The dream.

450
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,548
I'll be out. I'll be out in a minute.

451
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:22,845
Anthony?

452
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:31,478
So, I don't know what this is,
or how you knew it existed,

453
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,939
but this is everything
we have under Helen Lyle.

454
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:36,650
I didn't. That's why I had to ask.

455
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,863
Well, here it is.

456
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:42,447
Thanks, I appreciate it.

457
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:45,158
Of course.
I found it filed under True Crimes.

458
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,369
Work-study undergrads are the worst.

459
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:48,954
So, are you a student?

460
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:55,794
<i>Some of the things that
have happened in Cabrini over the years,</i>

461
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:59,798
<i>violence just so extreme, so bizarre.</i>

462
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:03,969
<i>It's almost as if violence
became a ritual.</i>

463
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:05,345
<i>The worst part,</i>

464
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,182
<i>the residents are afraid
to call the police.</i>

465
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:12,102
<i>A code of honor, perhaps,
fear of the police themselves.</i>

466
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:15,105
<i>The easy answer is always,
"Candyman did it."</i>

467
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:17,691
<i>The summoning game itself
could be connected.</i>

468
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:20,819
<i>I mean, it's clear that
no one person makes this up.</i>

469
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:24,156

<i>Bernadette and I tried the summoning.</i>

474
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:38,295
<i>It's amazing how effective it can be.</i>

475

<i>The suggestion that

00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:47,095
<i>But I get it.</i>

Excuse me.

486
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:25,694
<i>And she heard
a noise. Do you remember her name?</i>

487
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:28,071
<i>I think
her name was Ruthie Jean,</i>

488
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,741
<i>and she heard this banging and smashing…</i>

489
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:33,035
<i>…like somebody was trying to make

490

<i>So, Ruthie called 911</i>

<i>and she said, "There's somebody
coming through the walls."</i>

492
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,708
<i>And they didn't believe her.</i>

493
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:42,211
<i>They thought
the lady was crazy, right?</i>

494
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,087
<i>Mm-hmm.
So, she called 911 again,</i>

495
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:46,381
<i>and they still didn't believe her.</i>

496
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:49,343
<i>And when they finally got there,
she was dead.</i>

497
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:50,761
<i>Was she shot?</i>

498
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:53,388
<i>No.</i>

499
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:56,850
<i>No, she was killed with a hook.</i>

500
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:58,477
<i>Yeah.</i>

501
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,145

502
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:02,773

We have the dinner tonight.

508
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:17,371
I don't know how long I'll be.

509
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:21,500
Jack Hyde is coming in from New York,
and he never comes to Chicago.

510
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:24,920

511
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,755

<i>Don't fuck this up for me.</i>

514
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:20,475
It's been a crazy couple of weeks.

515
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,854
That is putting it mildly.

516
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:29,735
As you can imagine, what I'm writing is
no longer an exhibition review.

517
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:30,986
It's...

518
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:33,947
It's now expanded into a larger article,

519
00:43:34,031 --> 00:43:35,657
which impacts both the works

520
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:39,745
and the circumstances around the murders.

521
00:43:39,828 --> 00:43:41,038
I see.

522
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:45,042
So, I just wanted to get
a few quotes from you.

523
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,003
Well, I don't know much of anything.

524
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:50,547
Your work is so macabre, and that's…

525
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:55,052
pretty interesting,
considering what happened.

526
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:57,638
That's a coincidence.

527
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:00,098
I'm not saying that you're at fault,

528
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:02,809
and I'm certainly not saying
that a ghost manifested

529
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:06,939
by collective storytelling
killed a prominent art dealer.

530
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:09,191
I'm just saying that…

531
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:13,654
all of a sudden, your work seems…

532
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,199
eternal.

533
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:21,453
What's next?

534
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:25,707
I'm expanding the work into a series.

535
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:29,545
I'm hoping to do a solo show.

536
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:32,714
All about Candyman. Spread the word.

537
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:34,591
Mmm, I love that idea.

538
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:40,264
I'm surprised at how positive
your take on my piece seems to be now.

539
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:42,975
Well, it grew on me.

540
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:45,686
- Seemed like you didn't quite get it.
- No, I get it.

541
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:49,273
It's the hood, gentrification, et cetera.

542
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,692
Artists gentrify the hood?

543
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,987
Who do you think makes the hood?

544
00:44:56,613 --> 00:45:00,450
The city cuts off a community
and waits for it to die.

545
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:03,996
Then they invite developers in

546
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,415
and say, "Hey, you artists,

547
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:09,710
you young people, you white,
preferably or only…

548
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:13,505
please come to the hood, it's cheap.

549
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:17,384
And if you stick it out for a couple
of years, we'll bring you a Whole Foods."

550
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,929
You wanna be a part of the story, right?

551
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:22,556
Well, as a critic, I…

552
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:24,975
To really engage with the work,

553
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:26,393
to "get it"…

554
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:30,022
you should say it.

555
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:31,732
- Say what?
- Say his name.

556
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:39,198
Think I need to use the bathroom.

557
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:41,033
Oh, this is as good a time as any.

558
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:43,785
I dare you.

559
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:19,613
<i>Doors open
to the right at State and Lake.</i>

560
00:46:19,696 --> 00:46:22,741
<i>Transfer to Red Line trains
at State and Lake.</i>

561
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:04,491
Ah!

562
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:18,714
Finley?

563
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:56,770
Are you all right?

564
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:06,196
- I thought…
- What?

565
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:16,248
I gotta go.

566
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:50,199
Really?
No one's buying it, not that I care.

567
00:49:58,165 --> 00:49:59,416
Careful.

568
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:05,589
I love being here.
It's so provincial, yet exciting.

569
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:09,134
Oh, my God.
Have you met Danielle Harrington?

570
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:11,845
- She's chief...
- Curator at the MCA.

571
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:14,306
I find it crazy that
we actually haven't met yet.

572
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:15,891
I've been so eager to meet you.

573
00:50:15,974 --> 00:50:18,560
Don't you start already. I get first dibs.

574
00:50:18,644 --> 00:50:22,773
Clive literally had to die
for Brianna to be free. Sorry.

575
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:25,400
Jameson's doing a show
at my gallery in New York.

576
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:28,987
I think it's
the perfect opportunity for you

577
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:30,614
to spread your wings a bit more.

578
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:32,032
Come to the big city.

579
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:33,992
I could introduce you to
the women of Entre Nous

580
00:50:34,076 --> 00:50:35,160
if you decide on New York.

581
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:37,663
Wow. Thank you.

582
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:40,874
I've actually been considering
going out on my own.

583
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:43,085
Don't you wanna focus
on working with artists

584
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:46,088
instead of chasing outstanding invoices?

585
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:49,591
You can change the institution
from the inside.

586
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:52,427
You should come by the museum some time.

587
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:54,429
Okay.

588
00:50:54,513 --> 00:50:56,014
I think I'd like that.

589
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:57,391
Oh, my God.

590
00:50:57,474 --> 00:50:58,559
- What's wrong?
- What's happening?

591
00:50:58,642 --> 00:51:01,228
Finley Stephens was found dead
in her apartment.

592
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:02,980
Her husband found her.

593
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:05,816
Poor thing. Oh, her husband's a suspect.

594
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:09,653
- I have to go.
- Anthony.

595
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,093
Anthony?

596
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:34,803
<i>What is he?</i>

597
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:36,638
<i>Candyman ain't a he.</i>

598
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:38,974
<i>Candyman's the whole damn hive.</i>

599
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:41,518
There are others?

600
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:44,354
<i>Samuel Evans.</i>

601
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:48,692
<i>Run down during
the white housing riots of the '50s.</i>

602
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:51,820
<i>William Bell, lynched in the '20s.</i>

603
00:51:52,738 --> 00:51:55,782
<i>But the first one, where it all began,</i>

604
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:58,118
<i>was in the 1890s.</i>

605
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:01,747
<i>It's a story Helen found.
The story of Daniel Robitaille.</i>

606
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:07,044
<i>He'd made a living touring the country
painting portraits for wealthy families.</i>

607
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:10,047
<i>Mostly white, and they loved him.</i>

608
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:12,174
But you know how it goes.

609
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:15,844
They love what we make

610
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:17,012
but not us.

611
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:21,183
<i>One day, he's commissioned</i>

612
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:23,393
<i>to paint the daughter
of a Chicago factory owner</i>

613
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:25,646
<i>who made his fortune in the stockyards.</i>

614
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:26,730
<i>Well,</i>

615
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:30,192
<i>Robitaille committed
the ultimate sin of his time.</i>

616
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:32,736
They fell in love.

617
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:35,072
They had an affair, she got pregnant.

618
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:37,282
<i>The girl tells her father, and, well…</i>

619
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:38,367
<i>you know…</i>

620
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,161
<i>He hires some men to hunt Robitaille down,</i>

621
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:42,663
<i>told them to get creative.</i>

622
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:45,582
Chased him through here
in the middle of the day.

623
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:46,792
He collapses from exhaustion

624
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:49,545
right near where the old tower
in Chestnut used to be.

625
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:52,130
<i>They beat him. Tortured him.</i>

626
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:55,884
<i>They cut off his arm
and jammed a meat hook in the stump.</i>

627
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:59,012
They smeared honeycomb
from the nearby hives on his chest

628
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:00,389
and let the bees sting him.

629
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:03,183
<i>A crowd started to form to watch the show.</i>

630
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:05,936
<i>The big finale:</i>

631
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:08,564
They set him on fire

632
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:10,357
and he finally dies.

633
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:14,194
But a story like that,

634
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:15,571
a pain like that…

635
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:18,615
lasts forever.

636
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:22,202
That's Candyman.

637
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:28,375
So…

638
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:31,628
he's real?

639
00:53:31,712 --> 00:53:32,880
Bell is real.

640
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:36,758
Samuel, Sherman, Daniel Robitaille.
They're all real.

641
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:40,721
Candyman is how we deal with the fact
that these things happened.

642
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:42,514
That they're still happening.

643
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:47,060
Get some rest, young blood.

644
00:53:48,478 --> 00:53:50,022
You'll feel better in the morning.

645
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:08,457
Don't look at those!

646
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:11,376
What the fuck is this?

647
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:13,795
You shouldn't be looking at this.

648
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:18,842
Anthony, we are beyond
sensitive artist bullshit.

649
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:21,136
What is going on?

650
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:23,931
I think... I think…

651
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:28,727
- I made a mistake, Bri.
- What do you mean?

652
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:32,314
- I brought him back.
- Who?

653
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:35,400
You promise you won't think I'm crazy?

654
00:54:35,484 --> 00:54:36,902
Anthony, who?

655
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:42,241
Oh, God.

656
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:45,827
- Burke told me…
- God. Who is Burke?

657
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:47,704
From the laundromat.
He knows about all of it.

658
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:48,956
Knows about what?

659
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:51,583
Candyman.

660
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:55,462
- Candyman isn't real.
- I saw him!

661
00:54:55,546 --> 00:54:58,590
Candyman isn't real, Anthony!

662
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:02,427
You know what is real?

663
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:06,598
Me, Anthony. Me. This, this is real.

664
00:55:08,183 --> 00:55:10,060
- You don't understand.
- Okay.

665
00:55:10,143 --> 00:55:13,897
I will show you that... Okay.

666
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:15,941
- Candyman.
- No!

667
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:17,025
Candyman!

668
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:24,992
Don't… say his name.

669
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:27,035
- You stay the fuck right there.
- Brianna…

670
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,246
Don't follow me.

671
00:55:36,837 --> 00:55:40,340
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
Let the motherfucker try and come up here.

672
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:45,137
Fucking art ogre, fucking fee-fi-fo-fum.
Grady will stomp on his ass.

673
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,973
- Ain't that right, Grady?
- If I have to stomp, I'll stomp.

674
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:50,267
I mean, he literally was, like,

675
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,395
"I summoned Candyman," and I'm like…

676
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:55,105
Candyman ain't real, nigga.

677
00:55:55,189 --> 00:55:58,442
I told you not to start dating
that Dapper Dan-ass,

678
00:55:58,525 --> 00:56:01,778
li'l Basquiat-ass, fucking no-job Sun Ra...

679
00:56:01,862 --> 00:56:03,405
Troy. Okay.

680
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:06,283
Ain't a dick on the planet good enough
to offset a demonology hobby.

681
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:07,910
Okay, Troy, stop!

682
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:10,204
What? It's the truth.
If Grady came up in here,

683
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:12,122
smashing mirrors.

684
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:14,791
Mirrors.

685
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:17,336
He's right.

686
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:22,090
- All right.
- You…

687
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:25,219
take care of Lucy.

688
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:27,596
And you are in time-out.

689
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:28,805
Come here.

690
00:56:30,307 --> 00:56:31,517
Break it up.

691
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:39,024
I spoke to Mom.

692
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:42,402
She wants to close the storage unit out,

693
00:56:42,486 --> 00:56:45,364
so we finally have to deal
with Dad's work.

694
00:56:45,447 --> 00:56:47,366
I was thinking maybe we could

695
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:49,952
sell or…

696
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:55,541
- if you want to keep anything…
- No, I don't want any of that in my house.

697
00:56:55,624 --> 00:56:58,126
- Thank you.
- Then, sell or do a show.

698
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,753
I think you should open a space.

699
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:03,674
I'm not doing a show
of the thing that killed him, Troy.

700
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:05,968
You can't hide everything, and…

701
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:07,845
- and just hope it goes away.
- Troy…

702
00:57:07,928 --> 00:57:11,056
You don't have to be there every time
a tortured artist has a psychotic break.

703
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:17,771
I'm sorry.

704
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:21,358
Bri.

705
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,740
I'm glad you're here.

706
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:33,412
You can stay as long as you want,
on the condition you don't try

707
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:34,913
and summon Candyman.

708
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:37,791
Who would do that?

709
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:39,835
What's up?

710
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:49,970
Trina was fooked up this weekend.

711
00:57:50,053 --> 00:57:53,223
- Guys, what should I do about my bangs?
- No one cares about your bangs.

712
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:54,600
Annika, look at this.

713
00:57:54,683 --> 00:57:57,728
Trina's fucking trashed. Look.
Watch, watch, watch.

714
00:57:57,811 --> 00:58:00,439
- Samantha.
- Oh, my God, that's so sad.

715
00:58:01,148 --> 00:58:04,443
- Oh, shit.
- Look at this chunky-ass vomit.

716
00:58:04,526 --> 00:58:06,904
Oh, my gosh, in front of everyone.

717
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:08,780
Have you guys heard of Candyman?

718
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,367
Fuck this. I changed my mind.
I'm not gonna do it.

719
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:16,371
- Come on, Boof. Don't be a pussy.
- Why not? It's a warm and wonderful thing.

720
00:58:16,455 --> 00:58:17,956
Boof, we're already in formation.

721
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,583
- Fine.
- Okay, ready?

722
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,376
Candyman.

723
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,961
All at once, dumbass.

724
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:27,674
Candyman.

725
00:58:29,218 --> 00:58:30,469
Candyman.

726
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:33,472
Candyman.

727
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:37,893
- Not today. Not today.
- Come on.

728
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:39,686
Two more times.

729
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,151
Candyman.

730
00:58:46,235 --> 00:58:47,361
One more.

731
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,031
Candyman.

732
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:56,119
Well, we're still alive, so…

733
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,750
Hey, Trina.

734
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,169
Let's go.

735
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:12,803
Hey, Triney, how's that hangover?
You're such a mess.

736
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:19,852
- Trina was fucking trashed.
- Don't let her drink that much.

737
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,353
That's between her and her god.

738
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:24,147
Trina, you broke the fucking door.

739
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:29,778
Haley, I'm too young to die. Open it.

740
00:59:29,862 --> 00:59:31,530
I'm working on it.

741
00:59:36,326 --> 00:59:37,327
Guys…

742
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:38,662
What the fuck?

743
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:41,039
- Wait, I forgot my vape.
- Boof.

744
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:43,750
You know, I don't think you should…

745
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:45,210
Boof?

746
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:47,004
Boof?

747
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,756
Boof?

748
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:52,926
What are you doing?

749
01:00:06,857 --> 01:00:10,027
- Oh, my God, guys. Stop being so stupid!
- Haley!

750
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:27,127
This isn't funny.

751
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:31,590
You guys, what the fuck?
This isn't funny!

752
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:45,812
No!

753
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:55,030
No!

754
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:08,145
We've been trying to move
in a fresher direction

755
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:09,563
for the past few years,

756
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:13,775
and our last curator was a great guy,
but just had a hard time getting there.

757
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:16,695
Well, I've certainly noticed
a shift in programming

758
01:02:16,778 --> 01:02:19,615
- since you started here.
- Hopefully for the best.

759
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:22,784
I'm so happy I finally got
to meet you at Jack's dinner.

760
01:02:22,868 --> 01:02:25,495
Yes. He's been trying
to get us together before.

761
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:28,665
It's crazy about Clive.

762
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:31,210
I heard you were the one
to find the bodies.

763
01:02:31,293 --> 01:02:32,628
Yeah…

764
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:35,797
You've really emerged

765
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:39,593
as an interesting figure amidst all this.

766
01:02:39,676 --> 01:02:42,346
The show you put together
sounded so good too.

767
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:45,641
You were so brave to embrace formlessness.

768
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:50,145
Actually, there were a lot of bodies...
figures in the show.

769
01:02:50,229 --> 01:02:51,855
Like Arnold's work.

770
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:57,236
For so long, abstraction has been about
indexing a sublimated emotional state,

771
01:02:57,319 --> 01:03:00,239
- and I just wanted to focus on the body.
- Of course, but I mean,

772
01:03:00,322 --> 01:03:03,200
between the recent tragedies
and your father's legacy,

773
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:05,702
you've got a fascinating story.

774
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,247
Right.

775
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:10,707
And your eye for emerging talent.

776
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:13,126
How long have you worked
with Anthony McCoy?

777
01:03:14,044 --> 01:03:15,838
Just a couple years.

778
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:19,842
My board members are buzzing
about McCoy's work.

779
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:24,346
Feels like a Project Room show
is something we could start talking about.

780
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:28,433
And of course, any other artist
you have your eye on.

781
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:38,277
<i>The Near North Side
community, once known as Cabrini-Green,</i>

782
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,406
<i>is stunned by the vicious mass murder
at Golin College Prep.</i>

783
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:45,450
<i>Police have found a startling link
to the art world murders,</i>

784
01:03:45,534 --> 01:03:48,620
<i>in particular a piece called</i> Say My Name,

785
01:03:48,704 --> 01:03:51,456
<i>which was written in the victims' blood
on the bathroom wall.</i>

786
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,667
Welcome back, Mr. McCoy.

787
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,002
What?

788
01:03:55,544 --> 01:03:57,671
I saw in your file you were born here.

789
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,176
I was born on the South Side.

790
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:05,721
No, it says you were born here.

791
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:10,142
Regardless, it's good that
you came in when you did.

792
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:13,729
We need to admit you immediately
for monitoring and do some more testing.

793
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:47,304
Anthony, where have you been?

794
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:56,855
What happened to your hand?

795
01:04:57,648 --> 01:04:59,274
Looks bad.

796
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:04,071
Went to River North Memorial,
near Cabrini.

797
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:07,908
They fixed me right up.

798
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:11,745
You've been painting?

799
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:18,585
Yeah, I've been inspired a lot, actually,

800
01:05:18,669 --> 01:05:20,462
by Cabrini.

801
01:05:21,505 --> 01:05:23,423
You want some tea?

802
01:05:23,507 --> 01:05:25,551
I heard a story about a fire.

803
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:28,387
Killed a woman named Helen Lyle.

804
01:05:29,721 --> 01:05:31,348
A baby that was taken.

805
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,393
Something they used to call Candyman.

806
01:05:36,937 --> 01:05:38,647
Don't.

807
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:40,148
Don't say that.

808
01:05:44,236 --> 01:05:47,030
You told me I was born on the South Side.

809
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:49,408
I did raise you in the home you remember.

810
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:55,122
But you were born in River North Memorial

811
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:57,916
and spent the first two years in Cabrini.

812
01:05:59,126 --> 01:06:00,752
Why did you lie?

813
01:06:02,588 --> 01:06:04,006
To protect you.

814
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:10,137
From what?

815
01:06:13,557 --> 01:06:18,604
I just wanted you to grow up happy

816
01:06:18,687 --> 01:06:20,230
and normal.

817
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:28,155
Do I look normal, Mama?

818
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:35,746
I have to know.

819
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:38,457
Now.

820
01:06:48,884 --> 01:06:53,305
When you first got taken,
I thought she was the one who did it.

821
01:07:07,236 --> 01:07:11,156
When you first got taken,
I thought she was the one who did it.

822
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:13,200
Helen.

823
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:20,874
The way I found her in her apartment,

824
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:22,501
covered in blood.

825
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:26,004
We all thought she was crazy.

826
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:33,846
But it wasn't her.

827
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:39,726
It was him.

828
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:45,440
<i>He had a purpose for you.</i>

829
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:49,152
<i>He chose you to be</i>

830
01:07:49,236 --> 01:07:51,572
one of his victims.

831
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:55,659
He wanted you to burn in that fire.

832
01:07:55,742 --> 01:07:58,078
But she pulled you out…

833
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:02,124
and gave you back to me.

834
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:10,924
- <i>I thought it ended that night.</i>
- <i>Wait!</i>

835
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:14,803
<i>In the fire.
I thought she ended it.</i>

836
01:08:17,014 --> 01:08:19,850
And we vowed to never say his name again.

837
01:08:24,395 --> 01:08:25,898
But…

838
01:08:26,732 --> 01:08:30,736
someone broke the pact and…

839
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:32,069
He found me.

840
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:40,871
I'm sorry.

841
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:49,712
Anthony, wait, wait. Baby, wait.

842
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:51,548
Where are you going?

843
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:54,343
Anthony, baby, wait, wait, wait.

844
01:09:47,604 --> 01:09:48,897
Anthony?

845
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:50,858
It is Troy.

846
01:09:51,942 --> 01:09:56,321
Come out immediately where I can see you.

847
01:09:56,405 --> 01:09:59,783
- Immediately.
- Troy, stop. Please, oh, my gosh.

848
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:03,412
We are picking up her things

849
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:04,997
and we will…

850
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:08,542
be leaving with them.

851
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:10,419
I see. Yeah, thanks.

852
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:12,838
He's not with Noah either.

853
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:15,424
What the hell is going on?

854
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:18,886
- Maybe Candyman got his ass.
- That's not funny, Troy.

855
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:59,885
Hello?

856
01:11:11,146 --> 01:11:12,439
Anthony?

857
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,252
Nope.

858
01:11:47,933 --> 01:11:50,853
Hello! Excuse me!

859
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:52,479
Please!

860
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,037
Go away.

861
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:10,956
- I wanna play.
- No.

862
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:13,792
- Please. I'm not scared anymore.
- Go play with your puppets.

863
01:12:13,876 --> 01:12:16,420
I'm gonna pee on your bed
if you don't let me in.

864
01:12:16,503 --> 01:12:18,297
You're being so annoying right now.

865
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,049
- What are you doing?
- Mind your business.

866
01:12:21,133 --> 01:12:23,510
Come on, let me play. Please.

867
01:12:23,594 --> 01:12:26,680
This game is for grown-ups,
and you're a big baby.

868
01:12:26,763 --> 01:12:28,265
I'm not a baby.

869
01:12:28,348 --> 01:12:29,641
Go away!

870
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,480
No, this is not gonna work.

871
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:38,192
Candyman.

872
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:40,527
Candyman.

873
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:45,282
Candyman.

874
01:12:46,617 --> 01:12:47,951
Candyman.

875
01:12:50,245 --> 01:12:51,747
Candyman.

876
01:12:53,832 --> 01:12:54,917
I said…

877
01:12:56,877 --> 01:12:58,545
Sabrina?

878
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:12,476
Sherman.

879
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:23,654
Now…

880
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:26,949
we have a witness.

881
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:36,124
I think I saw the guy
you're looking for.

882
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:37,835
The "Say My Name" killer.

883
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:40,462
He's roaming around
the row houses at Cabrini.

884
01:13:40,546 --> 01:13:42,089
A Black man, around 30.

885
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:46,093
He was waving a hook and talking crazy.
I think he's killing people down there!

886
01:13:47,386 --> 01:13:48,720
What the fuck?

887
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:00,566
What the fuck?

888
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:04,069
I was baptized here.

889
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:07,948
Isn't it beautiful?

890
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:12,035
A... A... A... Anthony?

891
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:16,290
Oh, uh... Yeah, I guess I'm on
some other shit now, huh?

892
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,544
When something leaves a stain,

893
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:23,130
even if you wash it out,

894
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:24,214
it's still there.

895
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:26,675
You can feel it.

896
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:30,220
A thinning, deep in the fabric.

897
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:35,559
This neighborhood got caught in a loop.

898
01:14:35,642 --> 01:14:39,479
The shit got stained
in the exact same spot,

899
01:14:39,563 --> 01:14:41,231
over and over,

900
01:14:41,315 --> 01:14:43,942
until it finally rotted
from the inside out.

901
01:14:45,194 --> 01:14:48,280
They tore down our homes,
so they could move back in.

902
01:14:48,363 --> 01:14:50,741
We need Candyman.

903
01:14:51,617 --> 01:14:54,578
'Cause this time,
he'll be killing their fathers,

904
01:14:55,329 --> 01:14:58,540
their babies, their sisters.

905
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:04,963
I knew it was only a matter of time
before the baby came back here,

906
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:07,132
in perfect symmetry.

907
01:15:07,216 --> 01:15:11,803
A chance for Candyman to take back
what's rightfully his.

908
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:14,097
His legend.

909
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:22,189
Hand.

910
01:15:23,065 --> 01:15:24,816
Wait…

911
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,527
No, no, no, no!

912
01:15:29,154 --> 01:15:30,364
Anthony!

913
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:42,543
See, you can really make
the story your own.

914
01:15:43,418 --> 01:15:46,630
But… …some of the specifics

915
01:15:46,713 --> 01:15:48,799
should be somewhat consistent.

916
01:16:00,811 --> 01:16:04,356
Here we have the story of Anthony McCoy,

917
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:06,316
artist who lost his mind,

918
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,861
and the cops showed up
and shot him down in cold blood

919
01:16:08,944 --> 01:16:10,571
without even saying a word.

920
01:16:12,197 --> 01:16:15,450
Well, say his name, if you dare!

921
01:16:15,534 --> 01:16:18,871
Say it five times in a mirror.
See what happens.

922
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:24,293
When it's all done,
they'll tell his story,

923
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:26,962
and Candyman will live…

924
01:16:29,631 --> 01:16:30,716
…forever.

925
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:34,469
Here comes the swarm.

926
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:40,225
Are you ready for the sacrament?

927
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,983
Hey!

928
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:50,194
Where you going?

929
01:16:50,277 --> 01:16:52,362
Don't you want a sweet?

930
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,288
Fuck!

931
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:10,339
Where you going?

932
01:17:15,677 --> 01:17:20,516
<i>♪ Who can make the sunrise ♪</i>

933
01:17:22,809 --> 01:17:26,813
<i>♪ Sprinkle it with dew? ♪</i>

934
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

935
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:11,984
This is as good a place as any, pet.

936
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,210
I think he's dead.

937
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:37,342
Brianna.

938
01:18:58,363 --> 01:18:59,865
No, no!

939
01:19:01,575 --> 01:19:03,493
Get up, Anthony. Get up.

940
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:06,496
Baby, baby, baby…

941
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:09,750
Please. No. No.

942
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,793
Anthony, baby.

943
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:14,505
- It's okay.
- Get up, please.

944
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:18,008
Please.
Please stay with me, Anthony, please.

945
01:19:18,091 --> 01:19:21,345
Please, please, please. Please get up.

946
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:23,472
Please get up, Anthony.

947
01:19:25,098 --> 01:19:26,141
Don't go.

948
01:19:26,225 --> 01:19:29,019
We're gonna get you help.
We're gonna get you to a hospital.

949
01:19:29,102 --> 01:19:30,437
We're gonna get you to a hospital.

950
01:19:30,521 --> 01:19:32,147
In here!

951
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:35,067
- Put your hands up!
- He just needs…

952
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:16,149
Oh, my God.

953
01:20:25,242 --> 01:20:26,952
Hey. Stay on your feet.

954
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:28,704
- Come on. Move it.
- What's going on?

955
01:20:28,787 --> 01:20:30,747
We got two suspects, one's down.

956
01:20:30,831 --> 01:20:32,875
- Get her in the car.
- Hurry up.

957
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:36,253
We didn't know what to do.

958
01:21:10,537 --> 01:21:13,582
Very unfortunate
what happened to your man in there.

959
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,711
We'd been looking for him.

960
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:20,547
Got a tip he'd be here.

961
01:21:22,674 --> 01:21:24,176
You know anything about that?

962
01:21:28,222 --> 01:21:30,307
Whatever you tell us helps.

963
01:21:31,642 --> 01:21:33,310
Any cooperation is noted.

964
01:21:34,311 --> 01:21:35,938
Saying what you saw

965
01:21:36,813 --> 01:21:38,190
when he came at Jones…

966
01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:42,444
and Jones, obviously knowing
what he'd done before,

967
01:21:42,528 --> 01:21:46,073
seeing his hook,
knowing you were in danger,

968
01:21:46,156 --> 01:21:48,909
had no choice but to discharge his weapon.

969
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:54,790
Doesn't sound right to you?

970
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:00,629
Or…

971
01:22:01,755 --> 01:22:03,340
she's an accomplice.

972
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:08,053
She held the victims down, he cut 'em up.

973
01:22:09,638 --> 01:22:11,598
He died coming at a cop.

974
01:22:12,516 --> 01:22:15,435
She goes to jail for the rest of her life.

975
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:21,441
Which story is it?

976
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:30,492
Can I see myself?

977
01:22:30,576 --> 01:22:31,869
What?

978
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:33,453
In the mirror.

979
01:22:34,955 --> 01:22:38,542
I'll tell you everything
if you let me see myself.

980
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:41,503
No.

981
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:44,798
I'll say whatever you want.

982
01:22:58,437 --> 01:22:59,688
Candyman.

983
01:23:05,777 --> 01:23:07,237
Candyman.

984
01:23:07,321 --> 01:23:09,198
What?

985
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:14,036
Candyman.

986
01:23:15,329 --> 01:23:16,872
What the fuck is that?

987
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:21,502
- Candyman.
- Candyman?

988
01:23:27,007 --> 01:23:28,383
What the fuck?

989
01:23:28,467 --> 01:23:29,760
Holy shit.

990
01:23:29,843 --> 01:23:32,012
Rooney? Jesus. What the fuck?

991
01:23:32,095 --> 01:23:35,265
10-1, emergency. Officer down.
Officer down.

992
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:36,767
What the fuck!

993
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:39,228
Get on the ground now! Now!

994
01:23:44,024 --> 01:23:45,192
What the fuck!

995
01:23:47,027 --> 01:23:48,487
- Let me in.
- I can't!

996
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:49,821
Let me in, damn it!

997
01:23:50,781 --> 01:23:52,574
- Stop!
- No, no, no, no, no!

998
01:23:54,576 --> 01:23:55,827
Holy shit!

999
01:23:57,538 --> 01:23:58,914
What the fuck?

1000
01:24:09,466 --> 01:24:10,634
Who are you?

1001
01:24:13,136 --> 01:24:14,596
<i>I am</i>

1002
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,390
<i>the writing on the walls.</i>

1003
01:24:17,683 --> 01:24:21,812
<i>I'm the sweet smell of blood
on the street.</i>

1004
01:24:23,438 --> 01:24:26,358
<i>The buzz that echoes in the alleyways.</i>

1005
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:31,154
<i>They will say I shed innocent blood.</i>

1006
01:24:31,238 --> 01:24:33,574
<i>You are far from innocent,</i>

1007
01:24:33,657 --> 01:24:35,492
<i>but they'll say you were.</i>

1008
01:24:36,493 --> 01:24:38,078
<i>That's all that matters.</i>

1009
01:25:57,991 --> 01:25:59,201
Tell…

1010
01:26:00,661 --> 01:26:02,204
everyone.
