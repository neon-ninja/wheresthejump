Alvarez boys
aren't going to class again.

50
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:40,384
Okay, well,
why is Donna going over there?

51
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,152
I transferred
some of your cases.

52
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:43,321
Now, Donna has more energy.

53
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,923
- More energy?
- And more time.

54
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,258
She doesn't have the outside
responsibilities you have.

55
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,460
- She has no kids.
- She has support at home.

'Cause her husband isn't dead.

57
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,935
She was on time

All right? But believe me,
we all understand.

59

Do you?

60
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:02,843
Doesn't really feel like it.

61
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:05,843
Less time here,
more time at home

62
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,044
might not be such a bad thing.

63
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,313
Patricia Alvarez isn't gonna
talk to someone like Donna.

64
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,515
"Someone like Donna"?

65
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,417
I just mean that she knows me.

66
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,219
I've been with that family
for four years.

67
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,354
I've seen those kids grow up.
Patricia trusts me.

68
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,056
She knows that I'm a mom, too.

69
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,493
The job is to do
what's best for the kids.

70
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:22,025
Okay, okay, look.
Just keep the case.

71
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:24,061
Once you get done here,
check in with patrol.

72
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,496
- I don't need patrol.
- Take an officer.

73
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:28,368
That's not a request.

74
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,135
[officer] I'm sorry.

75
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,571
[Anna] You know what, I can
handle this myself, okay?

76
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,439
I'm sure you can.

Hi, Patricia.

80
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,353
How are you?

81
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,554
Are the boys home?

82
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:53,023
- Ma'am, open the door.
- No, that's okay.

83
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,958
Just give us a second.

84
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,395
Patricia, where are the boys?

85
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,229
They're somewhere safe, Anna.

86
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:01,064
[Anna] Oh.

87
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,633
Look, I don't know
what's going on,

88
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,501
but I might be your best bet
at clearing things up.

89
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:06,203
So why don't you let me in

90
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:09,475
and you can show me that
they're safe, like you said?

91
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,946
No, he doesn't even
have to come inside.

92
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,551
Okay? Why don't you
just let me in?

that I'd go in alone.

00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,489
Yeah, out of respect
for Officer Garcia.

96
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,256
Your husband
was a police officer.

97
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:28,494
You think he'd let you
go in there alone?

98
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:30,530
Yeah, I do.

99
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:34,164

Guys,
everything's all settled.

You're gonna have warm beds,

and hot food,

146
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,868

Okay?

00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,882
My gosh!

149
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,452
How did that happen?

150
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,889
She did it.

151
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,623
Your mother did that to you?

152
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,691
[Tomas] No.

153
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:56,295
It wasn't her.

154
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:06,571
Your mother loves you.
You know that, right?

155
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:07,705
Whatever's happening,

156
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,510
we're gonna
take care of it, okay?

157
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:13,179
But for tonight,
you guys are safe.

158
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:16,182
I promise you.

159
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,654

Hi!

163
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,168
Sorry I'm late.

164
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,566
How was school?

166
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,939
Hey, Sam.

00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,872
Hey.

168
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,340
There was meatloaf

[singsong] Hello?

172
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,348
Yeah, he heated it up.

173
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,681
Okay. Where is he?

174
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:54,387
He's playing in Dad's office.

175
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,422

176

a 10-15 in Midtown.

I'm pursuing on foot.

179
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:05,763
I think I see something.

180
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:06,897
There he is.

181
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,767
I'm on his tail.
I see the suspect.

182
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,402

she discovered him in the arms
of a younger woman.

325
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:30,634
What'd she do?

326
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,740
She took from him
what was most priceless.

327
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,243
She murdered their children.

328
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:43,546
In a fit of jealous rage,
she drowned them in the river.

what she had done,</i>

- <i>she was consumed by guilt.</i>

331

She threw herself
into those same waters.

was the religious one, not me.

What's going on, honey?

368
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,289
Honey, what happened
to your arm?

369
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,925
I fell.

370
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:23,062
That's quite a fall.

371
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:26,665
Hey.

372
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:31,434
I know things are a little bit
hard right now.

373
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,906
And I know that the world
sometimes seems scary.

374
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:37,907
But I was thinking,

375
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,944
remember what
Daddy used to say?

376
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,783
About if you were scared
and he wasn't there?

377
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,849
He'd tell you
to hold onto to Misty

378
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,821
and you squeeze her
really tight.

379
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,955
Does it feel any better?

380
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,958
That feels
a little bit better, right?

381
00:29:58,397 --> 00:29:59,598
What are you looking at?

382
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,867
[knock on door]

383
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,404
Coop's here.

384
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:15,848
Come on.

385
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:19,851
Come on, sweetie.

386
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:27,058
[thunder rumbling]

387
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:37,937
Rough day, guys?

388
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,873
Can we go watch TV?

389
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:44,610
Sure.

390
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,150
[sighs heavily]

391
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:56,389
[TV playing]

392
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,853
Um...

393
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:59,023
Cheers?

394
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,992
It's been that kinda day, huh?

395
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,961
- Week.
- Month?

396
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,897
- Year.
- [chuckles]

397
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,666
I don't know.
They're hanging in.

398
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,937
I think we need...

399
00:31:13,537 --> 00:31:14,803
Time.

400
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:16,007
Yeah.

401
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,176
And the occasional takeout,

402
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,476
so thank you.

403
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,645
You're welcome.

404
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,713
Well, if you're not
in the mood

405
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,781
to talk personal problems,

406
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:26,718
how about professional ones?

407
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,717
Oh, no. What?

408
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,890
It's about Patricia Alvarez.

409
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,190
We know that she had
some involvement

410
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,993
in her sons' deaths,
but she has a solid alibi.

411
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,528
Several parishioners
at her church say

412
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,263
they saw her at the time
that her kids were taken.

413
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,363
Really?

414
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:44,868
You know her story.
Just take a look at the file.

415
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,671
Maybe you'll see
something I missed.

416
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,772
I would love to help you

417
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,708
but she does not
want to see me.

418
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,676
Well, that's just it.

419
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:55,680
She's angry at you.

420
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,013
And one of the first things

421
00:31:58,015 --> 00:31:59,648
your husband
ever taught me is that...

422
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,586
Angry people love to talk.

423
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:16,996

00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,129

00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:02,987
What are you doing?

00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:06,324
Chris.

You okay, honey?

00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,532
Chris?

442
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:16,033
Honey?

443
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,270
You all right?

444
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,102
You okay, honey?

Honey. Hey.

Come on.

00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,631
Hey, wake up.

451
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,131
What happened?

452
00:37:50,133 --> 00:37:51,434
You were sleepwalking, baby.

453
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,102
Oh, sweetie.

454
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,238
You were just sleepwalking.

455
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,606
It's okay.

456
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,073
Come on. Come on, baby.

457
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,378
Let's get you upstairs.
Let's go to sleep.

458

Come on.

459

Is there someone in here?

463
00:39:04,474 --> 00:39:06,108
Because my husband is a cop

464
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,613
and he's gonna be home
any minute now.

Nothing. Nothing.

Nothing, honey. Nothing.

481
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,226
I'm sorry.
Come on in, honey.

I'm very sorry
about your loss.

I feel nothing.

00:41:53,443 --> 00:41:55,613
Because I have felt the worst.

497
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,347
I am done.

498
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:01,452
I don't care
what they do to me.

499
00:42:03,753 --> 00:42:05,823
You should be sitting here
instead of me.

500
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,658
You killed my boys, not me.

502
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,796
Patricia,
you had them locked up.

503

I had them hidden.

have they heard her crying?

513

Have they felt
the sting of her tears?

514

They will. Soon.

No, Patricia...

You know, when my boys died,

520
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:12,954
I didn't pray to God
for their salvation.

521
00:43:12,956 --> 00:43:16,494
Instead, I prayed to her.

and I prayed to her

525
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:24,466
to give my children
back to me

526
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,438

00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:21,538
[Donna] <i>Samantha,
how did you get those burns?</i>

555
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,680
How about you, Chris?

556
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,852
I told you, I fell.

557
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,551
Is that true?

558
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:37,889
Where was your mom?

559
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,892
Anna, you know
you can't be here.

560
00:47:44,894 --> 00:47:46,528
Oh, come on, Donna.
I wouldn't...

561
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,595
They're trying to protect you.

562
00:47:47,597 --> 00:47:49,131
They're telling you the truth.

563
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:51,733
I would never hurt my kids.

564
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:53,535
She's right.

565
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,939
You can't be here.

566
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,419
[Donna sighs]

567
00:48:10,653 --> 00:48:14,626
You may not believe this,
but I hate having to be here.

568
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:22,731
I promised your dad
I'd watch out for you guys.

569
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,798
So if you ever need anything,

570
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,136
just call me. Got it?

571
00:48:29,572 --> 00:48:32,207
We had to release
Patricia Alvarez.

572
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,645
Didn't have enough
to charge her.

573
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,449
Maybe she didn't do it.

574
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:40,652
What do you mean?

575
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,659
I don't know. Never mind.

576
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,925
Anna,

577
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,662
whatever's going on here,

578
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,630
fix it.

579
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:08,010
<i>Dad, for the first time
in my life, I'm in love.</i>

580
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:09,176
<i>That's very serious.</i>

581
00:49:09,178 --> 00:49:10,312
[Anna] Hey.

582
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:11,549
<i>And she loves me, Dad.</i>

583
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:17,555
Chris...

584
00:49:20,256 --> 00:49:21,793
Can we talk?

585
00:49:26,095 --> 00:49:28,032
Honey, I need to know
what really happened.

586
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:36,673
[water splashing]

587
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,698
[Chris] <i>I saw a woman.</i>

588
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,903
In the house?

589
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,106
In Samantha's room.

590
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:13,111
I thought it was Sam but...

591
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,283
A woman in a white dress.

592
00:50:19,617 --> 00:50:20,885
She was crying.

593
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,655
She wants us.

594
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,758
She wants us to be hers.

595
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:33,731
Ow. Mom, that hurts.

596
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:38,303
Rinsing.

597
00:50:44,707 --> 00:50:46,144
You believe me?

598
00:50:48,144 --> 00:50:49,246
Yes.

599
00:50:49,847 --> 00:50:51,082
I do.

600
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,088
[grunting]

601
00:50:57,887 --> 00:50:59,156
[gasping heavily]

602
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,809
[muffled screaming]

603
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
[faint thudding]
Sam?

604
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,258
Sam?

605
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,065
Sam! Sam!

606
00:51:42,865 --> 00:51:44,267
Sam! Open the door! Sam!

607
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:46,303
Sam!

608
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,239
[grunts]

609
00:51:51,207 --> 00:51:52,943
[Samantha coughing]

610
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:55,345
[gasping deeply]

611
00:52:00,017 --> 00:52:02,320
What happened?
What happened to you?

612
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,051
Honey.

613
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:05,822
You okay?
What happened?

614
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:09,360
Sam?

615
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:14,365
[whimpering]

616
00:52:16,432 --> 00:52:17,733
Sam?

617
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:18,769
[Chris] Mom.

618
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:20,905
[stammers] Mom. Mom!

619
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:22,903
Mom!

620
00:52:22,905 --> 00:52:24,039
- [screeching]
- [screaming]

621
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,309
- [sizzling]
- [screaming]

622
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
[groans] Go!
[Samantha continues screaming]
Go! Run!
Go!

623
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,249
Run!

624
00:52:35,251 --> 00:52:36,954
[whimpers]

625
00:52:38,521 --> 00:52:40,457
- [rumbling]
- [yelling]

626
00:52:43,392 --> 00:52:44,695
[door rattling]

627
00:52:46,095 --> 00:52:47,329
Run!

628
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:48,466
Go!

629
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,001
Run!

630
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:53,905
- [whimpers]
- [rumbling stops]

631
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,258
[Anna] I know it sounds
hard to believe.

632
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,829
[Father Perez]
A few years ago,

633
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:24,966
I placed little stock
in legends, myths,

634
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,171
things that go
bump in the night.

635
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,372
But then

636
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,042
there was an incident

637
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:35,146
with a doll.

638
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:42,517
It opened my mind

639
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,789
to possibilities
out of the ordinary.

640
00:53:45,988 --> 00:53:47,257
Can you help us?

641
00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:51,992
The Church works with people

642
00:53:51,994 --> 00:53:54,829
who specialize
in situations like this.

643
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,097
Okay.

644
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:00,036
But to get to them, we'd have
to go through the archdiocese.

645
00:54:01,537 --> 00:54:03,838
How long does that take?

646
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,544
At its best, several weeks
for a case to be approved.

647
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:13,517
[Anna] No.

648
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:17,619
There may be another way.

649
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:20,992
It's unorthodox,
but he's local.

650
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:24,294
However,
if you choose this route,

651
00:54:25,628 --> 00:54:27,562
I must obey
the laws of the Church,

652
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:30,631
and remove myself
from this process.

653
00:54:30,633 --> 00:54:34,269
As I said,
his methods are unorthodox.

654
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,437
And the Church, well,

655
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:39,573
the Church has their ways,
and he has his.

656
00:54:39,575 --> 00:54:42,914
It's why he abandoned
the collar years ago.

657
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:45,113
He used to be a priest.

658
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,117
Yes.

659
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:51,151
But now, he's a faith healer.

660
00:54:51,153 --> 00:54:53,053
A shaman who operates

661
00:54:53,055 --> 00:54:55,927
on the fringes
of religion and science.

662
00:54:58,195 --> 00:55:00,595
A <i>curandero.</i>

663
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,600
- [music playing on radio]
- [door bells jingling]

664
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,242
Don't touch anything, okay?

665
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,075
<i>Hola.</i> Excuse me.

666
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:16,913
- Um...
- I've seen you before.

667
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:20,649
The Alvarez memorial.

668
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:21,919
Yes?

669
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:25,019
Yes. I was her case worker.

670
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,521
Well, if you've come just to
gawk at my shop,

671
00:55:27,523 --> 00:55:30,327
I have more
important things to do.

672
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:32,626
You know what,
I don't think that

673
00:55:32,628 --> 00:55:33,995
we're in the right spot.
I'm sorry.

674
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,332
Come on, guys.

675
00:55:41,637 --> 00:55:42,639
Have you seen this before?

676
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:44,705
Yes.

677
00:55:44,707 --> 00:55:45,943
What is it?

678
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,142
The Church can help you.

679
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:51,181
No, no, no, please. The Church
sent us here, to you.

680
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:55,585
This is Church business.

681
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:59,122
Please.

682
00:56:09,465 --> 00:56:13,535
[Rafael] These are the marks
of <i>La Llorona.</i>

683
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,473
You have seen her then?

684
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,142
[Anna] You ever seen her?

685
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,146
No.

686
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,181
Not directly.

687
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,184
But I have seen what she does.

688
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,686
What do we do?

689
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:35,392
We are facing an evil
that has no bounds.

690
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,629
But she's not human. Right?

691
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:44,635
No. But she was,

692
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:50,540
until her murderous vanity
consumed her.

693
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:54,441
She's just a dark spirit.

694
00:56:54,443 --> 00:56:56,510
Unholy. Forsaken by God.

695
00:56:56,512 --> 00:56:58,479
Okay, that's it. I'm gonna
take them to a motel.

696
00:56:58,481 --> 00:56:59,615
Why?

697
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:04,452
She's attached herself to
your family, not your house.

698
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,425
If you move,
she will follow you.

699
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:11,128
What are we supposed
to do then?

700
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,369
I don't think
that's gonna help.

701
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:24,374
No. Not just this.

702
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,246
At the memorial,

703
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:34,615
I saw you speaking
with Father Perez.

704
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,619
He said that
you used to be a priest.

705
00:57:39,488 --> 00:57:41,624
My journey
began in the Church.

706
00:57:43,492 --> 00:57:44,661
Yes.

707
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:49,199
That was a long time ago.

708
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,474
Take me to your home.
We must begin immediately.

709
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,912
We're done.

710
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:08,216
I'm sorry, are you just gonna
rub eggs all over everything?

711
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,421
You think it's silly,
don't you?

712
00:58:11,153 --> 00:58:12,555
Pretty much.

713
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,459
Come with me.

714
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:21,428
This ritual, <i>la limpia,</i>

715
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,767
is used to detect
the presence of evil.

716
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:30,204
The bloodier the content,

717
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:32,308
the greater the evil.

718
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,082
[chanting in Spanish]

719
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,544
Oh, that's a trick.
I saw it on <i>Johnny Carson.</i>

720
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,182
Mom.

721
00:59:23,325 --> 00:59:24,394
[all gasp]

722
00:59:26,428 --> 00:59:27,465
Ta-da.

723
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,500
Did you see that on <i>Carson?</i>

724
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,104
No.

725
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,307
[praying in Spanish]

726
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:41,378

<i>Let's prepare.</i>

[muttering prayer]

731
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:20,381
That cross was carved
from a tree in Mexico.

732
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,316
It blooms with red blossoms

733
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:24,919
that make it look like
it's on fire.

[speaks Spanish]

735
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:30,624
The fire tree.

01:00:30,626 --> 01:00:32,162
[in English] They say

737
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:34,229
the fire trees wept

738
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:36,930
as <i>La Llorona</i>
drowned her children.

739
01:00:36,932 --> 01:00:39,767
As the only witness
to her sins,

740
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:42,573
they hold a special power
over her.

741
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:47,378
[blowing]

742
01:01:00,889 --> 01:01:04,791

<i>Amen.</i>

744
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:19,310
What is that?

745
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:22,276
[Rafael]
The tears of <i>La Llorona.</i>

746
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:23,479
I've sanctified them.

747
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:24,848
Why?

748
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,617
Antivenom.

749
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,495
[thunder rumbling]

750
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,640
Is that another ritual?

751
01:01:53,642 --> 01:01:56,347
Yes. Breakfast for dinner.

752
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,747
That was David's thing.

753
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:02,550
Breakfast for dinner.
I used to always tease him

754
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,785
it was 'cause cereal
was the only thing

755
01:02:03,787 --> 01:02:04,720
he knew how to make.

756
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:08,789
Tonight, <i>la comida</i>
is for comfort,

757
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,725
after everything
that you've been through,

758
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,996
and what's to come.

759
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:15,095
You don't seem very confident.

760
01:02:15,097 --> 01:02:17,932
I'm confident in God.

761
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,635
Father Perez said you turned
your back on the Church.

762
01:02:20,637 --> 01:02:23,274
The Church? Yes.

763
01:02:23,972 --> 01:02:26,376
God? Never.

767
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:42,559
Watch the flames.

768
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,559
A steady flame tells us

769
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:47,430
that our protective charms
are working.

770
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:50,401
Is she coming?

771
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:56,006
She's already here.

01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,499
She's searching.

779
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:26,704
For what?

780
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,439
Us.

You told us we'd be safe!

You said
the light would protect us!

816
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:37,385
Not true.

817
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:39,019
Mommy, Misty's gone!
I can't find her!

818

[Anna] Honey, not now.

819

You let her get me.

No. Of course not.

I used all of you as bait.

Are you crazy?

825
01:07:54,803 --> 01:07:56,303
What if you didn't
get to him in time?

826
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:57,303
But I did.

827
01:07:57,305 --> 01:07:59,309
And now <i>La Llorona</i>
is out of your house.

828

Remember the fire tree?

Those are its seeds.

As long as this line
remains unbroken,

she cannot enter.

833

Do not touch them.

834
01:08:13,156 --> 01:08:15,122

whatever she can

835
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:17,059

<i>La Llorona</i> had your daughter
in her grasp.

Now, when she calls to her
she will go.

When we banish the spirit,

895

her trance will be broken.

896
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:29,232

No.
