Have you drifted so far from God, Merrin,
that you can't see?

358
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:51,425
Monsieur Bession
was touched by the devil.

359
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:54,294
Demonic possession?
Forgive me, Father.

360
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:57,300
I never said he was possessed.
Only touched.

361
00:35:57,368 --> 00:36:01,304
So, "touched."
What does that mean?

362
00:36:01,372 --> 00:36:05,502
In 1647, the Ursuline Convent
in Loudon, France...

363
00:36:05,576 --> 00:36:08,374
was plagued by possession.

364
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:11,040
Thirty-four nuns had
been touched by the devil...

366
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,881
Having orgies including goats
doesn't make them possessed.

Simply horny... and inventive.

368
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,194
Four priests were dispatched
to exorcise the demons.

369
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:30,064
Three of them were possessed themselves
and subsequently died.

370
00:36:30,134 --> 00:36:33,592
The last one was driven insane
by his brush...

371
00:36:33,671 --> 00:36:36,162

372
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,233
That is what happened
to Monsieur Bession.

00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:43,007
And that evil remains in Derati.
