1
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:58,068
"To digest natural happiness,
as well as artificial happiness,

2
00:00:58,093 --> 00:01:01,698
you must first have the
courage to swallow it."

3
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:05,186
"Dump it and I'll kill you."

4
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:19,792
Hi.

5
00:01:20,922 --> 00:01:22,629
- Hi.
- The water's great.

6
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,291
Come here often?

7
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,644
I never saw you.
Pretty girls are--

8
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,624
Can you get my chair?

9
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:47,240
- That thing?
- Yes.

10
00:01:58,308 --> 00:01:59,481
Thanks.

11
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:17,475
So?

12
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:19,266
Pretty girls are what?

13
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:27,852
<i>I'm Eva Roussel.
I'm paraplegic.</i>

14
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:30,598
<i>My message to the next one.</i>

15
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:34,333
If you're watching,
you've had an Advent calendar.

16
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,166
Above all, follow the rules.

17
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:39,266
THE CALENDAR

18
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,813
<i>If you don't, you'll die.</i>

19
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:44,713
<i>Look out!</i>

20
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,263
THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3rd

21
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,416
Eva!

22
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:23,151
Yeah, come in!

23
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,571
Your November figures are bad.

24
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:35,428
- I worked like usual.
- OK, but do better.

25
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:38,118
You sell cheap family insurance!

26
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:41,398
All we do is pay out on it.

27
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,631
Buck up.
I had to shell out for you.

28
00:05:45,656 --> 00:05:48,338
- You get a grant.
- Not enough.

29
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:50,582
A new crapper cost a bomb.

30
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,873
- Hello.
- <i>Hello, Agnès, it's Eva.</i>

31
00:06:11,193 --> 00:06:13,786
- How's my father?
- <i>He's well.</i>

32
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:16,602
- <i>Could you put him on?</i>
- Why?

33
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:19,102
It's my birthday.
I'd like to chat.

34
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,846
Your father has forgotten you.

35
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:26,113
How can he remember your birthday?

36
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,510
I have to go.

37
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:30,418
I have things to do.

38
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,773
Let me in, I'm freezing!

39
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:06,849
Surprise!

40
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:08,264
You're here?

41
00:07:08,703 --> 00:07:10,868
Aren't you in Germany till Xmas?

42
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,374
Time off for your birthday.

43
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:16,025
German cake...

44
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:18,756
Champagne...

45
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:20,957
from Germany.

46
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:22,917
And...

47
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:27,997
A German present.

48
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,746
Happy birthday.

49
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,707
Hope you like it.

50
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,516
An Advent calendar?

51
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,803
- Like it?
- I love it.

52
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,943
A surprise a day till Xmas.

53
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,456
Where's it from?

54
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,116
The Munich Xmas market.

55
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:06,749
Meaning?

56
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,428
"The miracle of Christmas".

57
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:11,448
Dump it and I'll kill you.

58
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,920
It says so on the back.

59
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,196
Dump it and I'll kill you.

60
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:26,983
Who's "I"?

61
00:08:27,302 --> 00:08:28,543
"Ich".

62
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:33,556
Who's "Ich"?

63
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:35,669
Dump it and you'll see.

64
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,599
Give it to me.

65
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,988
"Rule number 1.

66
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:38,611
The calendar contains candy.
If you eat one, eat them all.

67
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,685
Or I'll kill you.

68
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:42,698
Rule number 2.

69
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:45,764
Respect all rules
until you open the last door.

70
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:47,617
Or I'll kill you.

71
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:51,725
Rule number 3.
Dump it and I'll kill you."

72
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,419
Sounds grim.

73
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:55,499
Germans are grim.

74
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,634
Careful.

75
00:09:58,343 --> 00:10:00,996
Eat one, you have to eat them all.

76
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:29,453
Did you put this in it?

77
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:30,806
No. Why?

78
00:10:33,248 --> 00:10:34,981
It was my dad's favourite.

79
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:39,247
Go on, eat it.

80
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:42,015
Maybe your dad will eat one too

81
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,048
and the chocolate will connect you.

82
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,624
I can't understand.

83
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:13,418
"To cure hurt,
destroy what hurt you."

84
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,872
No cheating!
Wait until midnight.

85
00:11:23,897 --> 00:11:25,614
OK, but it's jammed.

86
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:27,577
Let me see.

87
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,271
Yeah.

88
00:11:32,812 --> 00:11:33,812
<i>Kaput.</i>

89
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:42,536
<i>We're naked in bed.
I'm waiting for him to go.</i>

90
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,783
<i>But he gives me an odd look.</i>

91
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,332
<i>We'd just met.</i>

92
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:48,916
I don't know his name.
Karl, Klaus...

93
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,333
Something like that.

94
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,760
He's about to talk crap
like, "Ich liebe dich."

95
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,986
But then, the guy takes my hand

96
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,066
and says--

97
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
"Es ist Mitternight"?
Meaning?
"Midnight is here here.
Open the door."

98
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:05,524
"Jesus said to the cripple,
'Arise and walk.'"

99
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,815
I'm sorry.

100
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,582
It's late.

101
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:19,811
I start early.

102
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:23,096
- We never talk about it.
- I don't want to.

103
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,056
Not now, please.

104
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,762
Alright.

105
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,166
<i>Eva?</i>

106
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,012
Dad?

107
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:15,546
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

108
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,740
Dad?

109
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:22,601
Dad?

110
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,457
Eva!

111
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,832
Eva!

112
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,813
Meet Ms. Lemaire.

113
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:03,193
Hi.

114
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:04,986
Hello.

115
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:07,884
She'll take some of your clients
to train with.

116
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,637
Once she's ready,
she'll find new ones.

117
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,082
- And I get mine back?
- We'll see.

118
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,553
For me, a client's a client.

119
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:17,293
We need turnover.

120
00:16:17,747 --> 00:16:19,127
You or Myriam.

121
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,103
- Ms. Lemaire.
- Myriam is OK.

122
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:23,843
That's all.

123
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,287
Go and make some money.

124
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,925
I think you're really brave.

125
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:51,869
I couldn't.

126
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:53,365
What?

127
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:56,357
Work in that state.

128
00:16:57,043 --> 00:16:58,173
What state?

129
00:16:58,198 --> 00:16:59,509
Well, that.

130
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:02,488
I couldn't.

131
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:13,216
I wanted to ask...
Do you mind if we swap from Monday?

132
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:14,850
Swap desks?

133
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,996
- Yours is by the window.
- And?

134
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,416
- As you'll only work mornings...
- What?

135
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,303
John didn't tell you?

136
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:41,377
Want to have dinner with a buddy?

137
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:44,177
- I'll be in the way.
- You won't.

138
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,976
- Well?
- Do I know him?

139
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:48,749
No, his name's Boris.

140
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:50,207
A dumb trader,

141
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:51,983
but he'll buy dinner.

142
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:56,775
About that chocolate...

143
00:17:57,401 --> 00:17:59,001
It connected me to Dad.

144
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:02,898
It did?

145
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,525
Yeah.

146
00:18:04,928 --> 00:18:06,765
I ate it and he called me.

147
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:11,642
<i>It's weird. Dad has Alzheimer's,
he's forgotten me,</i>

148
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:14,166
<i>and called on a disconnected phone.</i>

149
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,995
Taking your anti-hallucination pills?

150
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,502
Yeah. It wasn't a hallucination.

151
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,466
Maybe it was an E or something.

152
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:36,933
Think so?

153
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,368
A druggy Advent calendar.

154
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:41,941
A high a day until Xmas.

155
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,541
You wanted your dad to call
and he did.

156
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,999
What did the vendor tell you?

157
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,475
We didn't talk much.

158
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:52,124
- I stole it.
- What?

159
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,125
Ready?

160
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:55,042
Let's eat.

161
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,305
Stop eating them if it spooks you.

162
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,586
It doesn't.

163
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,380
I was glad to hear my dad.

164
00:19:30,306 --> 00:19:32,972
Hey, Soso! Over here!

165
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:44,915
Hi there.

166
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,873
- You're Eva, right?
- Yes.

167
00:19:55,937 --> 00:19:58,416
I brought a buddy too.

168
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:01,292
No threesomes that way.

169
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:09,248
Thomas, Sophie... Eva...
And I'm Boris.

170
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:12,678
Careful, girls.
Thomas is an ace hunter.

171
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:14,155
When he sees two does...

172
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:19,452
OK, some bubbly! Champagne!

173
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,591
He needs a reason
to make you work part-time.

174
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:26,155
Handicapped is reason enough.
Right?

175
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:28,160
That's a dumb comment.

176
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:30,034
Just asking.

177
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:34,332
So, are you really a hunter or
was Boris being tactless again?

178
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:36,126
Pretty tactless.

179
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
But I do hunt now and then.

180
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:39,684
See, I was right.

181
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,501
But you were tactless.

182
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:45,151
I've never hunted.
I'd like to try.

183
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,293
I have a place in the country.

184
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:49,022
We can go one weekend.

185
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:51,976
- Even with your chair.
- I'd like that.

186
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,996
One last drink? I'm parched.

187
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,923
Not for me.

188
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:58,583
I'll go, it's late.

189
00:20:58,608 --> 00:21:01,024
Oh, right. I'll pay then.

190
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,366
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

191
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,366
Thanks for stepping in.

192
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:15,967
- What do you think?
- About who?

193
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:17,625
The hunter. He's a hunk.

194
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,285
He's nice.

195
00:21:19,414 --> 00:21:20,665
Be right back.

196
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:42,480
He wants to have a drink.

197
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,941
Now?

198
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:45,180
Alone.

199
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,431
That's kind but...

200
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,599
I'm already sleepy.

201
00:21:49,624 --> 00:21:51,123
Not with you, with me.

202
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:18,222
<i>Congratulations.</i>

207
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,011
I've no money for that.

208
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,023
I'll give you the 457 I just made.

209
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,943
Keep it and take me home.

210
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,582
You can keep your eyes closed.

What's up with you?

214
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:28,831
You said nothing so far.

215
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,161
I said nothing
cos I feel nothing, asshole!

216
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:35,881
- I'm paraplegic, get it?
- What?

217
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,606
Touch me
or poke your trader dick in me,

218
00:23:38,631 --> 00:23:39,921
I feel nothing!

219
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,033
I thought you were playing along!

220
00:23:48,518 --> 00:23:50,355
Can you feel with your mouth?

221
00:23:50,852 --> 00:23:53,215
Shit, you've turned me on.

222
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:55,411
Come here!

223
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,078
Come here, I said.

224
00:23:58,518 --> 00:23:59,878
Come on!

225
00:24:04,782 --> 00:24:05,948
Cut that out!

226
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:11,941
Fuck!

227
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:24,306
Fucking cut it out! Come here!

228
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,541
Drop dead!

229
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:39,981
What is this shit?

230
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,084
Fuck!

231
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:47,109
<i>It's me.
Heard about Boris?</i>

232
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:51,211
No, what is it?

233
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:54,451
<i>He crashed his car.
They found him crushed inside.</i>

234
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:56,209

Drop dead!

237
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,883
- In the park.
- <i>I'll be right there.</i>

238
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,446
SORRY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT

239
00:27:19,395 --> 00:27:22,761
<i>I get a message after he died?
Isn't that weird?</i>

240
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:25,288
No, it happens all the time.

241
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:28,485
One guy got my text dumping him
two days late.

242
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,165
Very awkward.

243
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:31,666
OK.

244
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:34,125
- What's My Trader Online?
- Screw that.

245
00:27:35,543 --> 00:27:37,396
- You clicked on the link?
- No.

246
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,365
Go talk to him.

247
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:56,420
To say what?

248
00:27:56,445 --> 00:27:57,824
Something nice.

249
00:27:58,038 --> 00:27:59,931
"Hi, I'm Eva..."

250
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,371
"I'm paraplegic.

00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:03,110

I have to go.

256
00:28:16,215 --> 00:28:17,707
Back to Munich?

257
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:20,235
- When'll you be back?
- In two weeks.

258
00:28:21,051 --> 00:28:22,418
Want a ride home?

259
00:28:22,857 --> 00:28:23,857
No.

260
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,271
I'll stay a while.

261
00:28:28,863 --> 00:28:29,863
Take care.

Mulled wine.

268
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:03,059
- OK.
- Thank you.

269
00:31:04,184 --> 00:31:05,448
And for you?

270
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,814
- The same as him.
- Two mulled wines.

271
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,327
Is this free?

272
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,273
May I sit down?

273
00:32:18,477 --> 00:32:20,053
I'm William, and you?

274
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:22,978
Eva.

275
00:32:23,438 --> 00:32:26,265
I won't stay long.
I'm on duty soon.

276
00:32:26,538 --> 00:32:28,058
On duty?

277
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:29,778
I'm a nurse.

278

You're paraplegic, I'm a nurse,

279
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,599
I can wash your private parts.

280
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:37,542
Shit...

281
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:40,888
Sorry, why did I say that?

282
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,895
I couldn't stop myself.

283
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:46,595
May I sit?

284
00:32:47,648 --> 00:32:50,231
Were you a pro or was it a hobby?

285
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,332
A pro.

286
00:32:52,421 --> 00:32:54,021
I've danced since I was six.

287
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,626
I mean, I danced.

288
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,506
Closing time.

00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,926
Can I drop you on my way to work?

290
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,660
You don't know where I live.

291
00:33:07,674 --> 00:33:09,874
True, but it's on my way.

292
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,707
OK, you can have it.

293
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,373
What?

294
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:31,606
You wanted my number?

295
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,726
- No.
- OK, since you insist.

296
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:45,133

You take four days off,

I didn't take time off.

Get the hell out.

307
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,920
Myriam can manage.

308
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:30,328
I pretended you were normal.

309
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,355
But, to be frank, you're just
a half-chick on wheels.

310

<i>Hello?</i>

311
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:00,876
What is it?

312
00:36:01,163 --> 00:36:03,876
Perhaps drugs
that cause hallucinations.

313
00:36:04,207 --> 00:36:05,376
Such as?

314
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:06,876
Depends on the candy.

My dad called for my birthday.

316
00:36:16,445 --> 00:36:18,278
I slept for 24 hours.

317
00:36:19,018 --> 00:36:20,267
I slept.

318
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:22,666
I slept for four days

319
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:25,408

who knows.

320
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,781
Time flew by.

321
00:36:27,898 --> 00:36:29,781

00:36:33,744 --> 00:36:35,424

323
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:39,292
Nothing.

00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:41,692
Nothing?

325
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,307

Don't you remember?

00:45:40,953 --> 00:45:42,369
Were you alone?

370
00:45:42,863 --> 00:45:44,286
Did someone attack you?

371
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:47,871
I don't know.

372
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:51,702
We'll keep you under observation.

373
00:45:52,776 --> 00:45:54,628
If everything's OK,
you'll leave tomorrow.

374
00:45:55,735 --> 00:45:57,461
Deliver me from evil.

375
00:46:44,598 --> 00:46:45,930
I walked.

376
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:50,999
Our Father in heaven,

377
00:46:51,872 --> 00:46:53,968
hallowed be your name,

378
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:56,864
your kingdom come,

379
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:01,666
your will be done,
on earth as in heaven.

380
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:06,048
Give us today our daily bread.

381
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:09,214
Forgive us our sins

382
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,666
as we forgive those
who sin against us.

383
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,450
Lead us not into temptation,

384
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,874
but deliver us from evil.

385
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:27,383
Deliver me from evil.

386
00:48:07,505 --> 00:48:08,971
Eva...

387
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,183
Deliver me from evil.

388
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,594
I WALKED

389
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:50,257
<i>Congratulations,
you have made 14,014 euros.</i>

390
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:00,721
You're selling Dad's house?

391
00:51:01,334 --> 00:51:04,194
Legally, it's mine too, as his wife.

392
00:51:04,488 --> 00:51:07,368
- What about him?
- I'll find a rest home.

393
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:09,235
He's not choosy.

394
00:51:09,372 --> 00:51:11,195
He's in his chair all day.

395
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,374
Him too.

396
00:51:20,501 --> 00:51:23,095
I won't offer you a drink,
you won't stay long.

397
00:52:09,971 --> 00:52:11,240
Eva...

398
00:52:24,854 --> 00:52:28,148
I called you for your birthday.

399
00:52:28,944 --> 00:52:30,152
I know.

400
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:33,491
I'm glad you're here.

401
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:37,496
I miss you so much.

402
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,437
I miss you too.

403
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:44,660
And your mother.

404
00:52:45,144 --> 00:52:46,456
I miss her.

405
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,013
If only you could help me join her.

406
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,000
Your calendar will demand
other sacrifices.

407
00:53:00,779 --> 00:53:02,886
Others will have to die.

408
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:05,319
Strangers...

409
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:08,457
Friends...

410
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:10,666
Those you love...

411
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,938
It's the price to pay.

412
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:18,451
If you want to walk, you have to kill.

413
00:53:19,588 --> 00:53:21,168
When my time comes...

414
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:25,124
don't hesitate.

415
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:30,542
If you refuse, you'll be sacrificed.

416
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:04,113
<i>This is Eva.
Leave a message.</i>

417
00:54:06,153 --> 00:54:07,360
It's me.

418
00:54:07,512 --> 00:54:10,315
- Just checking up on you.
- I'm fine.

419
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:14,143
Why're you here?

420
00:54:16,273 --> 00:54:17,933
I took two like that.

421
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:19,916
And?

422
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:22,321
I walked to the street.

423
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:24,666
- Eva...
- You don't have to believe me.

424
00:54:26,971 --> 00:54:28,691
I just want you to be here.

425
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,397
You'll take this one too?

426
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:35,083
Yes.

427
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:37,189
What'll happen?

428
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,396
I don't know.

429
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:41,957
That's why I'm here.

430
00:54:45,917 --> 00:54:46,917
OK.

431
00:55:13,914 --> 00:55:14,914
You okay?

432
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:37,990
Eva?

433
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:42,016
Eva...

434
00:55:44,306 --> 00:55:45,389
Eva...

435
00:55:52,917 --> 00:55:54,203
I can feel you.

436
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,020
Your hand on my thigh...

437
00:56:09,542 --> 00:56:10,707
I can feel it.

438
00:56:14,542 --> 00:56:15,832
I can feel you.

439
00:56:19,647 --> 00:56:20,771
I can feel you.

440
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:24,181
I can feel you.

441
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:03,968
Shit.

442
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:24,057
Hi there.

443
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:28,790
Let me know when you finish.
I'll get your chair.

444
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:31,170
- Thanks.
- No worries.

445
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:32,874
See you later.

446
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:01,739
<i>This is Eva.
Leave a message.</i>

447
00:58:01,792 --> 00:58:05,099
It's me.
You left your keys in my car.

448
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:07,989
I'll put them in the pot by the door.

449
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,321
A pretty common hiding place,

450
00:58:12,023 --> 00:58:13,416
but better than above the door.

451
00:58:13,441 --> 00:58:14,606
Bye.

452
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:27,615
<i>Sorry, why did I say that?
I couldn't stop myself.</i>

453
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

454
01:00:27,598 --> 01:00:30,771
TI PMUD T'NOD

455
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:51,376
It's Antoine from the pool.

456
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:56,215
- Anyone home?
- What do you want?

457
01:05:57,865 --> 01:06:00,058
I don't know how you left,

458
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:02,465
with your things still at the pool.

459
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:06,161
Your address was in the bag,
so I brought your chair back.

460
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,334
OK, I'll leave you my number.

461
01:06:09,942 --> 01:06:12,681
If you need anything, anything at all.

462
01:06:14,618 --> 01:06:15,773
Everything OK?

463
01:06:16,504 --> 01:06:18,319
Go or I'll set the dog on you!

464
01:06:21,841 --> 01:06:23,334
And close the gate.

465
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:06,988
William.

466
01:08:30,596 --> 01:08:31,876
William.

467
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:52,034
Eva?

468
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:03,916
Eva?

469
01:11:37,298 --> 01:11:38,578
Eva?

470
01:11:48,839 --> 01:11:49,999
Are you OK?

471
01:11:51,332 --> 01:11:52,812
She killed her dog.

472
01:11:53,765 --> 01:11:55,238
You're sleeping here?

473
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:56,632
I know, it sucks.

474
01:11:56,958 --> 01:11:58,585
But I can't leave her.

475
01:12:00,018 --> 01:12:01,428
Our weekend's off then?

476
01:12:01,707 --> 01:12:02,942
I don't know.

477
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:04,862
How big is the place?

478
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:07,397
There's room for her.

479
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:08,944
That's cool.

480
01:12:09,957 --> 01:12:12,143
I'll let her sleep
and we'll come tomorrow.

481
01:13:51,542 --> 01:13:53,362
- You opened it?
- Yeah.

482
01:13:53,542 --> 01:13:54,832
What was inside?

483
01:13:56,042 --> 01:13:57,315
Some chewing gum.

484
01:13:57,610 --> 01:13:58,693
Hand it over.

485
01:13:59,792 --> 01:14:00,985
Hand it over!

486
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:19,978
Nothing.

487
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:25,082
Nothing at all.

488
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:29,190
Still nothing.

489
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:06,556
That's awesome!
The Metropolitan?

490
01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:09,363
They confirmed it?
No more auditions?

491
01:15:10,136 --> 01:15:11,549
Any guys on the jury?

492
01:15:11,574 --> 01:15:14,616
I bet your sexy tutu caught their eye.

493
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:19,285
You were mad I left for Germany,

494
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:21,998
but I have to go to New York
to see you.

495
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:24,398
Let's immortalize the moment.

496
01:15:27,101 --> 01:15:28,334
Look out.

497
01:15:36,375 --> 01:15:37,568
Well?

498
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:39,541
What was the candy?

499
01:15:46,524 --> 01:15:47,750
A memory.

500
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:51,868
Good or bad?

501
01:15:58,312 --> 01:15:59,436
Bad.

502
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,416
You'll be OK?

503
01:16:07,528 --> 01:16:08,610
Yeah.

504
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:20,213
<i>I don't blame her.
I don't want her hurt.</i>

505
01:16:24,519 --> 01:16:28,280
<i>I don't blame her.
I don't want her hurt.</i>

506
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:46,396
Had a good night?

507
01:16:48,856 --> 01:16:50,146
Where's my dog?

508
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:54,458
He was cremated.

509
01:16:56,792 --> 01:16:57,957
That's good.

510
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:01,413
I don't blame you.

511
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,220
I don't want you hurt.

512
01:17:22,645 --> 01:17:23,811
Can we talk?

513
01:17:29,846 --> 01:17:32,492
After three years,
it's time we talked.

514
01:17:35,042 --> 01:17:36,282
He's not here.

515
01:17:36,514 --> 01:17:37,514
Who?

516
01:17:38,358 --> 01:17:39,455
Ich.

517
01:17:40,524 --> 01:17:42,356
He's not in his box.

518
01:17:42,651 --> 01:17:45,078
That calendar will drive you crazy.

519
01:17:45,545 --> 01:17:46,551
No.

520
01:17:46,993 --> 01:17:48,618
It'll give me my legs back.

521
01:17:58,667 --> 01:18:00,427
Every day, I blame myself.

522
01:18:01,542 --> 01:18:03,115
I'm what hurt you.

523
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:09,743
What hurt me...

524
01:18:14,792 --> 01:18:16,374
- Get out of here.
- What?

525
01:18:16,375 --> 01:18:17,878
Leave, it's dangerous.

526
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:20,673
You hurt me.

527
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:23,173
If I eat this, he'll destroy you.

528
01:18:23,725 --> 01:18:25,432
If he does, will you walk?

529
01:18:26,448 --> 01:18:27,448
Yes.

530
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:29,701
Then eat it.

531
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:34,417
Go on.

532
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:45,457
Look after it.

533
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:48,086
Give it to me tomorrow.

534
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:52,149
I'll eat it at home, alone.

535
01:18:52,755 --> 01:18:53,849
OK.

536
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:04,844
I don't blame her.
I don't want her hurt.

537
01:19:05,821 --> 01:19:07,208
I don't blame her.

538
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:09,148
I don't want her hurt.

539
01:19:10,937 --> 01:19:12,164
Everything OK?

540
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:14,082
She's feeling paranoid.

541
01:19:16,792 --> 01:19:18,445
She wants to leave tomorrow.

542
01:19:18,842 --> 01:19:20,049
What's that?

543
01:19:20,975 --> 01:19:25,223
A baby Jesus.
Don't eat it or I'll die.

544
01:19:27,883 --> 01:19:29,340
And your baby Jesus?

545
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:31,624
Is he dangerous?

546
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:41,190
Stop.

547
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:43,541
- It's no use.
- What?

548
01:19:43,542 --> 01:19:45,508
She's next door. I can't.

549
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:47,181
She's asleep.

550
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,233
Maybe, but I can't.

551
01:20:08,167 --> 01:20:10,308
- What is it?
- What do you think?

552
01:20:10,857 --> 01:20:12,514
<i>Super erection.</i>

553
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:14,957
Open wide.

554
01:20:30,042 --> 01:20:31,595
We're back in business.

555
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:42,856
I don't want her hurt.
I don't blame her.

556
01:20:42,975 --> 01:20:44,256
I don't want...

557
01:21:38,734 --> 01:21:40,025
Thomas!

558
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:44,957
Sophie?

559
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:52,250
Sophie?

560
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:56,916
Sophie, what's going on?

561
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:38,133
I need to see Aloïs Hoffmann.

562
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:40,806
I'm Aloïs Hoffman.

563
01:24:41,531 --> 01:24:42,878
What do you want?

564
01:24:42,917 --> 01:24:45,258
- It's about your painting.
- What painting?

565
01:24:45,393 --> 01:24:47,267
I've done hundreds.

566
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:49,158
The one from last year.

567
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:52,274
Is this a joke?

568
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:01,243
I couldn't have painted it last year.

569
01:25:04,978 --> 01:25:07,064
I've been blind for five years.

570
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:11,368
Follow me.

571
01:25:17,884 --> 01:25:19,323
Give me the painting.

572
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,206
I didn't paint this horror, miss.

573
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,733
My wife and son are well.

574
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:21,780
Why would I paint them dead?

575
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:27,498
Because they were dead then.

576
01:26:29,896 --> 01:26:32,356
It's a message for the next one.

577
01:26:32,875 --> 01:26:34,457
You had to sacrifice them.

578
01:26:36,879 --> 01:26:38,378
Get out of my home.

579
01:30:31,975 --> 01:30:34,073
Love, Eva

580
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:29,207
It's my turn.

581
01:32:32,292 --> 01:32:34,085
You had to sacrifice her too?

582
01:32:34,481 --> 01:32:35,665
No.

583
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:37,707
She was for fun.

584
01:34:25,078 --> 01:34:26,838
You're not paralysed anymore?

585
01:34:27,133 --> 01:34:28,215
I'm over it.

586
01:34:31,064 --> 01:34:32,064
Cool.

587
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:44,776
So,

588
01:34:45,230 --> 01:34:46,716
after you eat the last candy,

589
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:49,236
things rewind and you forget?

590
01:34:49,958 --> 01:34:51,123
Like the painter?

591
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:54,223
Yeah.

592
01:34:55,723 --> 01:34:57,410
I'll wake on December 1st.

593
01:34:57,833 --> 01:34:58,936
Paraplegic.

594
01:35:01,542 --> 01:35:03,128
You'll forget what we did?

595
01:35:04,168 --> 01:35:05,615
It won't have happened.

596
01:35:07,083 --> 01:35:08,596
Why did you bring me here?

597
01:35:11,075 --> 01:35:13,068
In 10 minutes, my body will be no use.

598
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:15,828
I wanted to enjoy it while I could.

599
01:35:58,724 --> 01:36:00,224
I'm Eva Roussel.

600
01:36:00,684 --> 01:36:02,058
I'm paraplegic.

601
01:36:02,875 --> 01:36:04,582
My message to the next one.

602
01:36:05,147 --> 01:36:08,187
If you're watching this,
you've had an Advent calendar.

603
01:36:09,231 --> 01:36:11,421
Above all, follow the rules.

604
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:15,397
<i>If you don't, you'll die.</i>

605
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:18,643
<i>The calendar will demand sacrifices.</i>

606
01:36:19,042 --> 01:36:20,296
<i>Obey.</i>

607
01:36:20,917 --> 01:36:23,350
<i>If you refuse, you'll be sacrificed.</i>

608
01:36:23,375 --> 01:36:25,210
If you die before the 24th,

609
01:36:25,299 --> 01:36:28,117
all deaths will be final, yours too.

610
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:27,838
MY MESSAGE FOR THE NEXT ONE

611
01:37:57,625 --> 01:37:58,878
Wait!

612
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:02,082
Not the last one.

613
01:38:02,705 --> 01:38:04,225
If I don't eat it, I'll die.

614
01:38:04,583 --> 01:38:06,723
- That's the first rule.
- OK.

615
01:38:06,969 --> 01:38:11,209
Rule 2 says to respect all rules
until you open the last door.

616
01:38:11,792 --> 01:38:14,132
You opened it. No more rules.

617
01:38:14,493 --> 01:38:15,558
Do as you want.

618
01:38:17,787 --> 01:38:18,787
What now?

619
01:38:20,585 --> 01:38:21,792
Rule number 3.

620
01:38:22,125 --> 01:38:24,318
Dump it and I'll kill you.

621
01:38:25,025 --> 01:38:26,258
Stop!

622
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,536
No more rules!

623
01:38:40,625 --> 01:38:42,916
It's over! Do as you want.

624
01:38:43,603 --> 01:38:45,263
You have a choice.

625
01:38:45,742 --> 01:38:48,909
Eat it and wake on December 1st
in your chair.

626
01:38:49,083 --> 01:38:51,623
Or dump it and wake tomorrow in shape.

627
01:38:52,167 --> 01:38:53,416
Cool, huh?

628
01:38:53,417 --> 01:38:55,624
The dead stay dead, but you'll walk.

629
01:39:09,913 --> 01:39:11,240
Happy birthday.

630
01:39:11,265 --> 01:39:12,427
Who's "Ich"?

631
01:39:12,685 --> 01:39:14,380
Dump it and you'll see.

632
01:39:14,525 --> 01:39:15,607
I'm William.

633
01:39:15,917 --> 01:39:17,683
Half-chick on wheels.

634
01:39:17,783 --> 01:39:20,430
- Stop eating this crap.
- You'll go crazy.

635
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:23,497
- It'll give me my legs back.
- Others will have to die.

636
01:39:25,141 --> 01:39:26,339
<i>I can feel you.</i>

637
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:29,266
<i>It's the price to pay.</i>

638
01:39:58,229 --> 01:40:00,099
ONE YEAR LATER

639
01:40:00,329 --> 01:40:01,856
<i>I'm Eva Roussel.</i>

640
01:40:02,031 --> 01:40:03,488
<i>I'm paraplegic.</i>

641
01:40:03,667 --> 01:40:05,832
<i>My message to the next one.</i>

642
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:08,819
<i>If you're watching this,
you've had an Advent calendar.</i>

643
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,593
<i>Above all, follow the rules.</i>

644
01:40:11,917 --> 01:40:14,610
<i>If you don't, you'll die.</i>
