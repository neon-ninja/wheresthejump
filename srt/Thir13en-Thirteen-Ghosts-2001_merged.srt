RESYNCHRONiZE AND FiXED BY
' N3krA ' 
SEPTiCEMiA TEAM

2
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:35,477
Is it bad tonight?

3
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,856
Bad. That's one way to describe it.

4
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:43,026
Insane seems a little more appropriate.

5
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,821
It feels like he's breathing down my neck.

6
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,868
It is my professionaI opinion
we should get the hell out of here. Now.

7
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:52,745
Noted.

8
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:56,790
Clean this place up, then locate our guests.

9
00:03:04,673 --> 00:03:06,675
I just need to take the edge off.

10
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:11,054
You know the routine.
I need you clear-headed.

11
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:13,682
First things first.

12
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,021
Now, where is he?

13
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:23,984
Show me where he's hiding.

14
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

15
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,544
Son of a bitch!
You said he only killed nine people.

16
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:44,171
There are 40 victims here.

17
00:03:44,254 --> 00:03:47,382
Nine when he was alive.
He's added a few since then.

18
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:49,426
Now where is he, Dennis?

19
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:02,606
All teams go to alpha. Bring in the cube!

20
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:09,947
How did this guy get the name
"The Breaker"? Is he a truck driver?

21
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,451
Simple folkIore.
The locaI color exorcising its demons.

22
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:18,288
Maybe it's because he broke his victims
into as many pieces as possible.

23
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,794
I hate being rushed.

24
00:04:24,086 --> 00:04:25,838
This one isn't like the others.

25
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:28,799
- I'll give you a bonus.
- You don't have that kind of money.

26
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:31,718
After tonight you'll be surprised.
Now, get to work.

27
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:40,602
CarefuI, Dennis.

28
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:44,148
Don't get too curious.

29
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:48,736
Son of a bitch!

30
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:53,657
How can you justify what you're doing,
Cyrus? It's out and out slavery!

31
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:57,619
You are persistent, Damon.
And what about you, Kalina?

32
00:04:57,828 --> 00:05:01,582
Still carrying around
those ridiculous quicksilver flares?

33
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,792
You still have that quaint magicaI book?

34
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:07,337
These aren't animals you're capturing,
they're human beings.

35
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:09,131
They are dead human beings.

36
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:13,177
Maybe you should join Greenpeace.
Throw blood on old women's furs.

37
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:17,055
Who are you to play God?

38
00:05:19,016 --> 00:05:21,894
- Playing is for children.
- You'll never pull it off.

39
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:26,315
Not without the right spells.
That, and the thirteenth ghost.

40
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:27,816
Thirteenth ghost?

41
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:31,695
Get them out of my sight!
We've wasted too much time already.

42
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:34,490
Why did he say thirteenth?

43
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:36,909
Move the cube into position.

44
00:05:37,284 --> 00:05:39,328
What's he talking about, 13 ghosts?

45
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:43,040
You contracted me for 12 ghosts!
The Breaker is 12!

46
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,334
I'm done after tonight, Cyrus.

47
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:49,713
Yes. Twelve and then one more.
I thought you were psychic!

48
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:51,882
That's not how it works, and you know it!

49
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:53,801
There's no time to argue.

50
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:56,303
Release the bait!

51
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:59,389
What bait? We never needed bait before!

52
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:15,906
A truck full of blood?
You've got to be shitting me.

53
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:20,661
Oh, boy.

54
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:27,042
Now...

55
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:29,628
...power up the cube.

56
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:38,387
Start transmitting.

57
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:10,127
Come.

58
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:13,213
Come.

59
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:15,048
Come!

60
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:26,143
Help me! Help me!

61
00:07:31,774 --> 00:07:33,108
Oh, shit!

62
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:40,300
Put him down!

63
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:58,235
Cyrus, I hope you're happy.
You've got your twelve now.

64
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:01,029
Help me! He's dying!

65
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:04,700
Hang on, Damon. Somebody help!
Damn you, Cyrus!

66
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:07,369
Somebody help me, please!

67
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:11,081
Help me. Do something!

68
00:09:19,757 --> 00:09:21,425
Oh, Cyrus.

69
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:23,343
Oh, God.

70
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:35,355
- Swing me!
- Come on, Bobby.

71
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:37,733
Faster, Kathy.

72
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:39,401
Let me get your arms.

73
00:09:39,526 --> 00:09:41,195
Try to drag me.

74
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:45,574
You're the best little brother.
I love you. Let's go!

75
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,203
I'm going to get you! I'm going to get you!

76
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:54,500
Look at those two. She's got him
on the run now, but pretty soon...

77
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:58,003
...he's going to be picking her up
and throwing her over his shoulder.

78
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:00,255
They're perfect.

79
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:02,966
Watch them. Watch them.

80
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:06,970
They really love this place.

81
00:10:14,686 --> 00:10:16,230
I love you.

82
00:10:16,355 --> 00:10:18,023
Surprise!

83
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:21,735
My heart! My heart!

84
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:23,654
Happy birthday, Dad!

85
00:10:25,197 --> 00:10:26,865
Happy birthday, Arthur.

86
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,700
Here's my present, Dad.

87
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:31,620
We love you. Make a wish.
Blow out the candles.

88
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:35,124
What did you wish for?

89
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:37,709
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

90
00:10:43,215 --> 00:10:45,884
What's that? Why is the smoke alarm on?

91
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:48,512
I'll get the kids. Call the fire department.

92
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:50,305
Dad! Help, Mom!

93
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:53,517
Get the kids. Get the kids!

94
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:56,228
Mom! Dad! Help me!

95
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,856
Where's your mom? Where is she?

96
00:10:58,897 --> 00:11:00,399
I don't know where Mom is.

97
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:03,318
Bobby, we have to get out. Oh, my God!

98
00:11:03,402 --> 00:11:04,903
Jean! Jean!

99
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:08,907
Mom's still in the house.
We can't leave her there.

100
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:12,244
Bobby, go outside. Go wait outside.

101
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:14,663
You can't go back in there, sir.

102
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:24,923
I'm sorry, sir. She didn't make it.

103
00:11:25,257 --> 00:11:27,426
I should have gone back in.

104
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:34,850
We are gathered here today,
to honor the memory...

105
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:37,352
...and life's work ofJean Kriticos...

106
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:40,981
...a devoted mother and loving wife...

107
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:43,984
...who was too quickly taken from this life.

108
00:11:44,526 --> 00:11:49,364
Jean, you will be forever missed,
but never forgotten.

109
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:52,785
I miss you, Mom.

110
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:55,329
Why did you have to leave us?

111
00:11:57,206 --> 00:11:59,041
I can't do this without you.

112
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,751
I don't want you to go.

113
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,170
Mom, I love you so much.

114
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:05,798
Please watch over us.

115
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:09,718
I'll love you always.

116
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:21,605
Dad, it's...

117
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:27,194
It's almost 8:30.
Shake a leg or you'll miss your first class.

118
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:30,906
Today on Death in America:
"Cancer rates are down...

119
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:33,117
"... but suicide is sky-high.

120
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:35,494
"We have a speciaI treat for you today.

121
00:12:35,577 --> 00:12:38,831
"A body was found this morning,
decolopolated. "

122
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,959
"Decapitated. "

123
00:12:42,376 --> 00:12:44,086
Bobby, find a healthier hobby.

124
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:46,630
Leave me alone, you guys, I'm recording.

125
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:49,091
Good morning, everybody.

126
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:52,344
Something smells interesting.

127
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:55,764
Dad, they found a guy without a head
behind Dunkin' Donuts.

128
00:12:56,473 --> 00:12:58,475
I love Dunkin' Donuts.

129
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,936
Kathy.

130
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:05,774
Let Maggie make breakfast for once.
That's why we hired her.

131
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:08,026
Dad, have you tasted Maggie's cooking?

132
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,987
Just that one time.

133
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,240
I heard that. Hell, I cook better than you.

134
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:15,284
We have to try to get along here.

135
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:21,373
Dad, tell Kathy that keeping
a record of death is healthy.

136
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,626
Kathy, "Keeping a record of death
is healthy. "

137
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,962
Because she's being a reaI slut about it.

138
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:30,174
Bobby. Don't call your sister a slut.

139
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:31,759
Thank you, Maggie.

140
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,136
I prefer the term "bitch. "

141
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:36,638
Sluts are girls with loose-

142
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,974
Mr. Edgar Allan Poe,
did you do your homework?

143
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:41,351
Because Mr. Peterson-

144
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:46,482
Damn it! Bobby, that's the third time
I've tripped on that stupid scooter!

145
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:49,151
- Sorry.
- If we had a bigger place, we wouldn't-

146
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:51,528
We don't have a big place anymore, do we?

147
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,405
It's the best I can do for now...

148
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:57,159
...so let's all try and keep our shit
off the floor.

149
00:13:57,743 --> 00:14:01,038
All right? Now, Bobby,
put away the damn tape recorder.

150
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,540
Can you do that for me?
And get ready for schooI.

151
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,959
I'm sorry, Dad.

152
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:11,256
Must be the lawyer. I forgot.

153
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,259
Lawyer? I thought our credit
was all cleaned up.

154
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:16,428
No, I don't think it's about that.

155
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:20,974
They won't make us move again, will they?

156
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:24,019
It's gonna be all right.
Whatever it is, we'll deaI with it.

157
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:26,647
Mr. Kriticos?

158
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,315
That's right. You are?

159
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,401
Ben Moss. How do you do?

160
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:31,819
Please, come in.

161
00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:34,363
Is now a good time, or...?

162
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:39,243
As good a time as any.
Please, just give me one minute.

163
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:44,832
Sorry. I'm ready.

164
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,627
I represent the estate of your uncle
Cyrus Kriticos.

165
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:50,379
We have an Uncle Cyrus?

166
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:55,092
Had. I only met him a couple of times
as a kid.

167
00:14:55,217 --> 00:14:56,802
He wasn't too popular.

168
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,596
My dad said
he squandered the family fortune.

169
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:01,306
We have a family fortune?

170
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,851
No. Cyrus squandered it.

171
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:06,478
Bobby, isn't that great?
You have a late uncle.

172
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:09,064
- What is he late for?
- His next birthday.

173
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:10,816
You mean, he's dead?

174
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:13,360
- Now we get his attention.
- Pipe down.

175
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:15,571
Cyrus recorded this message
six weeks ago.

176
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:18,615
He asked that it be played for you
in the event of his death.

177
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,001
Arthur...

178
00:15:30,335 --> 00:15:32,171
...it's good to talk to you.

179
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:36,258
Sadly, if you're watching this now,
it means I am no longer among the living.

180
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:41,430
Happily, that makes you and your family
my sole beneficiaries.

181
00:15:41,597 --> 00:15:43,932
I've instructed my lawyer, Mr. Moss...

182
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:48,729
...to deliver the essential elements
in my last will and testament.

183
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:50,773
Give it to them, Ben.

184
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:58,113
A key?

185
00:15:58,447 --> 00:15:59,782
A key to what?

186
00:16:00,032 --> 00:16:01,742
A key to your new house.

187
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:02,951
What?

188
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:07,122
This house is the fruit of my life's work.

189
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,752
Bathrooms.
Everyone gets their own bathroom.

190
00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:12,920
Is this for reaI?

191
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:17,091
It is a one-of-a-kind home.
It's my home, actually.

192
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:21,136
My home.

193
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,848
I have no complaints.
I've led an interesting life.

194
00:16:25,307 --> 00:16:28,102
I have seen some amazing things.

195
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:35,359
But the only regret I have, is that
I never got to know my nephew Arthur...

196
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:39,446
...nor appreciate the love of a family,
like you have.

197
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:43,617
This house is my attempt
to make up for that.

198
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:46,328
Enjoy.

199
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,083
Perhaps we'll meet again...

200
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:54,336
...in another life.

201
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,342
- Wow!
- When can we see it?

202
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:03,887
The house is yours whenever you like.
I'm heading up there after work.

203
00:17:03,971 --> 00:17:06,765
If you want, you, your wife and kids-

204
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,017
Time-out. I am not the missus here.

205
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:11,270
My wife...

206
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:13,105
My wife is...

207
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,983
Our mom got burned to death in a fire.

208
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,026
What? It's true.

209
00:17:18,402 --> 00:17:19,403
That's enough, Robert.

210
00:17:20,863 --> 00:17:25,200
Mr. Moss, exactly where is this place?

211
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:29,037
A couple hours drive from here,
a town called Willow Grove...

212
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:30,622
...just up the parkway.

213
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:34,793
It's in a gorgeous area. But I warn you,
your uncle liked his privacy.

214
00:17:34,877 --> 00:17:37,212
There isn't a neighbor for miles.

215
00:17:37,337 --> 00:17:38,589
Come on. Hurry up.

216
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,550
S- U-F.

217
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:44,636
Suffocate. I got it. I win.

218
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,389
So what? You think you're so slick.

219
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:50,100
Come on, you guys. We're almost there.

220
00:17:52,102 --> 00:17:56,065
- Excited?
- Yeah. Mom would have freaked over this.

221
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:02,321
Looks like things are
starting to get better, right?

222
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:03,697
Yeah.

223
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,241
That's strange.

224
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:34,663
Dad, it's beautifuI.

225
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:40,002
My God. I've never seen anything like it.

226
00:19:42,504 --> 00:19:43,881
CooI!

227
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,592
So futuroic.

228
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:56,977
It's about time somebody showed up.
Is this your place?

229
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:59,521
- Who are you?
- I'm the power guy.

230
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:02,733
Don't touch.

231
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:07,279
Your house is knocking out the power
of the whole tri-quad area.

232
00:20:07,362 --> 00:20:09,531
I need to get inside
and check the breakers.

233
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:12,493
Could you come back tomorrow?
Is that a possibility?

234
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:14,203
Tomorrow? Let me see.

235
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:17,915
There are about 5,570 houses right now
without power.

236
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:20,042
My bosses kind of frown on that, so...

237
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,087
Well, that's not really our problem, is it?

238
00:20:25,506 --> 00:20:28,383
Look, buddy, I've been doing this job
for about three weeks.

239
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:30,928
Is there any way
you can give me a break here?

240
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:32,221
Sure.

241
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:33,847
No problem.

242
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,642
Thank you.

243
00:20:37,476 --> 00:20:38,685
Mr...?

244
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:40,813
Kriticos. Arthur Kriticos.

245
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:44,441
It's quite a place you've got.

246
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:47,444
Yeah. We're moving in.

247
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:49,405
One step at a time.

248
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:10,259
- That's odd.
- Dad, you broke it.

249
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:12,177
Bobby, give it a rest.

250
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:18,767
Hello.

251
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:22,271
Wow! You can see right through it.

252
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,441
You guys couldn't afford any walls?

253
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:27,109
How weird.

254
00:21:27,234 --> 00:21:30,237
Guess Uncle Cyrus wasn't too keen
on privacy.

255
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:34,032
I hope the bathroom's in the basement.

256
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:17,534
It's like a funhouse.

257
00:22:19,495 --> 00:22:20,996
It's Latin.

258
00:22:31,924 --> 00:22:33,842
Everything's so beautifuI.

259
00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:40,474
Family, just so we're all clear,
Miss Maggie does not do windows.

260
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:41,975
Wow!

261
00:22:48,315 --> 00:22:50,943
What an incredible wealth of knowledge.

262
00:22:54,488 --> 00:22:56,323
A samurai sword.

263
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:58,534
In your dreams, paI.

264
00:23:01,745 --> 00:23:04,373
Dad, this stuff must be worth a fortune.

265
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:07,084
Yeah, that occurred to me, too.

266
00:23:15,592 --> 00:23:17,344
Oh, Cyrus.

267
00:23:17,594 --> 00:23:21,098
You crazy son of a bitch, what did you do?

268
00:23:37,823 --> 00:23:39,074
Goodness.

269
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,410
It's like a cathedraI.

270
00:23:42,745 --> 00:23:46,165
All right, first rule: No throwing stones.

271
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,334
It's marvelous, though, isn't it?

272
00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:52,212
A living work of art.

273
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:59,887
The sooner you show me
where you hid the basement...

274
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,347
...the sooner I can get my ass out of here.

275
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,351
I believe it's down the hall.
It's two doors on the right.

276
00:24:10,564 --> 00:24:12,024
Excuse me.

277
00:24:16,695 --> 00:24:19,406
The construction is amazing.

278
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:23,452
I'm getting dizzy.

279
00:24:27,414 --> 00:24:28,707
Bobby.

280
00:24:28,832 --> 00:24:32,461
Don't touch anything. Okay?

281
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:36,673
At least untiI we get property insurance.

282
00:24:37,508 --> 00:24:40,052
Arthur, we've got some papers to sign
in the library.

283
00:24:40,135 --> 00:24:43,555
After that, I'd love to give you
and your family a tour of the house.

284
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:47,059
Great. I don't want you guys to move
from this spot.

285
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:48,352
We'll be right back.

286
00:24:48,435 --> 00:24:51,105
You're being paranoid and overprotective.

287
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,565
Yeah, of all this stuff.

288
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:56,276
I know you guys too well. Stay...

289
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,072
...right here. I mean it.

290
00:25:23,512 --> 00:25:25,013
What the...?

291
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:45,033
Where'd you hide your money, old man?

292
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

293
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:01,508
Shit!

294
00:26:02,676 --> 00:26:04,511
What the hell was that?

295
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:13,020
Oh, no.

296
00:26:13,729 --> 00:26:14,897
Oh, Cyrus.

297
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,236
Now I know I'm dreaming.

298
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,032
Was Cyrus a hunter?

299
00:26:25,365 --> 00:26:26,575
You could say that.

300
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,454
Your uncle was quite a collector
of many things.

301
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:42,007
I've marked where
you're supposed to sign, Arthur.

302
00:26:42,091 --> 00:26:43,592
Okay, look.

303
00:26:44,676 --> 00:26:47,930
I didn't want to bring this up
in front of the kids...

304
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:52,893
...but this place is beyond amazing.

305
00:26:58,816 --> 00:27:00,484
I'm just a math teacher.

306
00:27:01,568 --> 00:27:03,821
The taxes alone must be...

307
00:27:03,862 --> 00:27:06,281
I have nothing set aside.

308
00:27:08,075 --> 00:27:12,204
To be honest, a fire took away everything.

309
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:14,581
Arthur, you don't need to worry.

310
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:18,794
Cyrus was a genius
when it came to finances.

311
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:22,798
Basically, you and your family
never have to worry about money again.

312
00:27:27,052 --> 00:27:28,345
Son of a bitch.

313
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

314
00:28:26,153 --> 00:28:28,280
Lookee here. Look, y'all.

315
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:31,241
Look, look!

316
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:40,125
Sign.

317
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:42,878
Arthur?

318
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:46,882
Arthur, we've got to...

319
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:49,426
We have to talk.

320
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,553
What is the deaI with the breakers?

321
00:28:51,637 --> 00:28:56,016
Nothing. I'm not a power guy.
My name is Dennis Rafkin.

322
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,394
- You're Dennis Rafkin?
- Who's Dennis Rafkin?

323
00:28:58,435 --> 00:29:00,437
My office warned me about this guy.

324
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:03,607
I know this will sound
completely whacked, but stay with me.

325
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,820
I used to hunt displaced spirituaI energies
with your uncle.

326
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:09,279
I'm sorry?

327
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:13,367
PK agents. Revenants. Wraiths.

328
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:16,245
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

329
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,541
Okay. I'll do this the easy way: ghosts.

330
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,043
Arthur, I used to...

331
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:26,505
I used to hunt ghosts
with your Uncle Cyrus.

332
00:29:28,465 --> 00:29:29,425
Goats?

333
00:29:29,508 --> 00:29:32,553
Ghosts! Ghosts, goddamn it!
Listen to me!

334
00:29:32,803 --> 00:29:34,513
Race you to the end of the hall.

335
00:29:34,596 --> 00:29:37,099
No, Bobby, I don't think this is the place-

336
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:40,602
Come on, slowpoke!
Is that the best you got?

337
00:29:40,644 --> 00:29:43,105
My grandma scoots better than that.

338
00:29:43,147 --> 00:29:48,485
Ghosts. As in disgruntled spirits
trapped on earth. Ghosts.

339
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,987
As in Halloween? Boo?

340
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,031
As in Demi Moore
and Unchained Melody. Ghosts.

341
00:29:53,115 --> 00:29:56,243
Ghosts. Okay, I get it. I'm scared.

342
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:58,912
Don't laugh at me. Don't laugh.

343
00:29:59,955 --> 00:30:01,373
I'll explain everything...

344
00:30:01,457 --> 00:30:05,043
...as soon as you get
you and your children outside.

345
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:07,296
- What's taking you so long?
- Out of my way.

346
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:09,798
- I don't think scooting is your game.
- Come on.

347
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,968
- I won.
- You cheated. I didn't get a start.

348
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:14,720
Got to be on your toes, man.

349
00:30:14,803 --> 00:30:18,682
This has to be my room.
There are toys everywhere.

350
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:22,895
- I wonder what my room's like.
- This is the coolest room in the house.

351
00:30:27,816 --> 00:30:29,485
I'll be in here.

352
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:47,419
This place is awesome!

353
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:51,507
Cyrus has containment cubes
all over the basement.

354
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:54,134
I don't know why they're here...

355
00:30:54,426 --> 00:30:57,137
...and I am not staying around to find out.

356
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:59,681
- So, if I were you-
- Well, he isn't you.

357
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:03,227
This guy has been harassing my office
since your uncle died.

358
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,354
I see this all the time.

359
00:31:05,437 --> 00:31:08,816
Some rich guy passes away
and all the nuts come out!

360
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:12,319
Next thing, he'll be claiming
Cyrus owned him money or-

361
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:15,739
He did owe me money.
He owed me a shitload of money!

362
00:31:16,156 --> 00:31:18,450
These are some funky-looking specs.

363
00:31:20,828 --> 00:31:23,872
- What do you think? Do I look cooI?
- Let me see.

364
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:25,833
Not so fast. Cater to my ego first:

365
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:27,835
"Maggie's the best babysitter
you ever had. "

366
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:29,878
- Come on!
- All right.

367
00:31:30,212 --> 00:31:32,881
I'm getting my ass
out of the big glass house!

368
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Grab your children! Do the same.
Are you all right?

369
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,358
Jean! Jean!

370
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:56,864
We'll go get you some help. Okay?

371
00:31:57,781 --> 00:31:59,116
Don't touch me.

372
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:10,711
Oh, my God!

373
00:32:19,386 --> 00:32:20,763
We have struck gold.

374
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:24,016
- Easy.
- Don't.

375
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,360
How's your head?

376
00:32:36,236 --> 00:32:37,738
Not good.

377
00:32:39,323 --> 00:32:40,574
Where's the suit?

378
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,547
Power guy. Idiot.

379
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:58,550
CooI!

380
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:01,220
Better have a pair of those in my room.

381
00:33:01,595 --> 00:33:03,138
Bobby, where are you going?

382
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,186
What are you staring at?

383
00:33:11,438 --> 00:33:12,981
Hey, kiddo.

384
00:33:14,274 --> 00:33:16,110
He thinks I'm going to duck.

385
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:18,570
Nice tits.

386
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:24,618
What's the matter, honey?
Bad representation?

387
00:33:52,396 --> 00:33:54,273
Not bad for an hourly wage.

388
00:34:05,117 --> 00:34:06,827
It's time to leave.

389
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,079
I'll take your word for it.

390
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:12,082
Kathy?

391
00:34:19,715 --> 00:34:21,175
Come on. This way.

392
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:27,890
Shit! What the hell? Kathy!

393
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:31,935
Maggie? Bobby!

394
00:35:01,048 --> 00:35:03,675
I was just kidding before.

395
00:35:04,676 --> 00:35:06,261
A little lawyer humor.

396
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:43,340
Kathy?

397
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:45,175
Bobby!

398
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:50,556
I don't believe it.

399
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,015
Believe what?

400
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:58,188
- I told them not to leave this spot.
- They're kids, what do you expect?

401
00:35:58,272 --> 00:36:01,817
Thank you, Dr. PhiI. You check downstairs.
I'II look up.

402
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:04,194
Bobby, come on! It's time to go!

403
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:15,164
Kathy? Where are you guys?

404
00:36:15,247 --> 00:36:16,457
Bobby!

405
00:36:19,126 --> 00:36:20,919
I'm sorry.

406
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,502
I'm sorry.

407
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

408
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:37,723
What are you doing up here?
I told you to wait downstairs.

409
00:38:37,806 --> 00:38:41,060
Dad, come on.
This bathroom is unbelievable.

410
00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:44,688
Great house. BeautifuI bathroom.
Now, where is your brother?

411
00:38:45,272 --> 00:38:46,899
He's with Maggie.

412
00:38:47,274 --> 00:38:51,403
Was with Maggie. We were racing
and we saw all the glass-

413
00:38:51,487 --> 00:38:55,491
You're supposed to watch him.
That's what I pay you for.

414
00:39:06,418 --> 00:39:07,795
Bobby.

415
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:13,425
Down here.

416
00:39:14,343 --> 00:39:15,677
Maggie?

417
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,013
Come on down and play.

418
00:39:18,347 --> 00:39:19,890
Is that you?

419
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,227
Maggie?

420
00:39:23,685 --> 00:39:24,978
Stop playing games.

421
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:29,733
Bobby? I have something for you.
We'll have lots of fun.

422
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:33,153
Don't come down, Bobby.

423
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,031
Stay upstairs.

424
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:40,035
Don't follow her.

425
00:39:42,037 --> 00:39:44,039
Down here, Bobby.

426
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:48,919
Bobby, don't come down.

427
00:39:50,212 --> 00:39:53,382
Bobby? Around the corner.

428
00:39:54,883 --> 00:39:56,719
Don't come down here!

429
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,262
That's it.

430
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,305
You guys, I'm gonna tell Dad!

431
00:40:01,724 --> 00:40:03,058
Bobby!

432
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:08,647
I'll find Bobby.
But I want you both out of here.

433
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:10,149
- But, Dad-
- No "buts"!

434
00:40:10,232 --> 00:40:13,819
I want you both to wait in the car.
I'll be out as soon as I find the kid.

435
00:40:13,902 --> 00:40:17,531
- Why are you freaking out?
- Just this once, don't argue with me.

436
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:21,952
What happened to the door?

437
00:40:22,411 --> 00:40:24,079
Son of a bitch!

438
00:40:24,413 --> 00:40:26,081
I cannot believe this.

439
00:40:26,415 --> 00:40:29,126
I'm going to have to break it down.
Back away!

440
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,468
It's quite dramatic...

441
00:40:37,926 --> 00:40:40,637
...but you're wasting your time.
It's all sealed up.

442
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:43,807
- Weren't you in an orange jumpsuit?
- Don't go there.

443
00:40:43,891 --> 00:40:45,684
What do you mean, "all sealed up"?

444
00:40:45,768 --> 00:40:48,562
What part of that code
are you having trouble cracking?

445
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:50,272
The entire house is sealed up.

446
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:53,525
- There must be another way out.
- I've looked.

447
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:56,695
We'II look again, right after I find my son.
Now get up.

448
00:40:56,779 --> 00:40:58,822
That's all right, I'll wait right here.

449
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:04,620
I don't know what is going on here,
or who the hell you are.

450
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,872
And my son is missing.

451
00:41:06,955 --> 00:41:10,209
So, untiI those questions are answered,
you're not leaving my sight.

452
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:12,461
Now, get up!

453
00:41:13,796 --> 00:41:16,131
All right. Breathe.

454
00:41:20,636 --> 00:41:22,137
Did the lawyer split?

455
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:34,024
Bobby.

456
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:37,403
Bobby.

457
00:42:36,545 --> 00:42:38,964
Come on, guys! Stop hiding!

458
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:46,263
Bobby!

459
00:42:46,513 --> 00:42:48,182
- Bobby.
- Come on out now, paI!

460
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:49,600
Stop screwing around.

461
00:42:49,725 --> 00:42:52,478
Glass family Robinson,
you're wasting your breath.

462
00:42:52,561 --> 00:42:55,272
This is ectobar glass. He won't hear you.

463
00:42:55,314 --> 00:42:57,649
This is shatterproof and soundproof.

464
00:42:58,067 --> 00:42:59,359
What are these?

465
00:42:59,485 --> 00:43:03,405
That's a little harder to explain.
They're containment spells.

466
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:05,199
Ghosts can't cross those.

467
00:43:05,657 --> 00:43:08,285
- Ghosts?
- Yes, ghosts.

468
00:43:09,328 --> 00:43:13,582
The supernaturaI realm has its own laws.
For ghosts, it's spells.

469
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:18,003
Written or spoken, the ghosts
have to obey whatever the spells say.

470
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

471
00:43:37,606 --> 00:43:40,109
The entire basement is filled with ghosts.

472
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:41,819
In this basement?

473
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:46,865
Of course, in this basement.
If it was next door, I wouldn't give a shit!

474
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Dad!
- I can prove it.
- I gave a pair of those to Bobby.

475
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,130
SpectraI viewers.
You can see ghosts with these.

476
00:44:01,213 --> 00:44:02,923
Bobby, come on.

477
00:44:03,006 --> 00:44:06,176
- I don't see any ghosts.
- Because they're locked downstairs.

478
00:44:06,301 --> 00:44:07,636
Dad!

479
00:44:08,303 --> 00:44:11,014
There's more of this crazy spell shit
on the floor.

480
00:44:12,474 --> 00:44:13,976
Let me see those.

481
00:44:21,775 --> 00:44:23,986
Bobby! Come on out, paI!

482
00:44:25,404 --> 00:44:29,533
Hidden barrier spells.
Why would he need more protection?

483
00:44:29,575 --> 00:44:32,703
All right, that's enough.
This is not helping.

484
00:44:32,786 --> 00:44:35,956
Do me a favor and stop
with all the haunted house nonsense...

485
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:39,042
...at least untiI we find the kid
and figure a way out of here.

486
00:44:39,668 --> 00:44:40,836
Bobby, come on.

487
00:44:40,919 --> 00:44:42,546
I don't know where he could be.

488
00:44:42,629 --> 00:44:44,715
No, no!

489
00:44:45,674 --> 00:44:47,009
Wait!

490
00:44:47,342 --> 00:44:51,597
What did I just say,
that there was a petting zoo downstairs?

491
00:44:51,847 --> 00:44:52,890
No!

492
00:44:52,931 --> 00:44:55,768
There are ghosts downstairs, Arthur.

493
00:44:55,851 --> 00:44:58,937
Right, right. But you also said...

494
00:44:59,646 --> 00:45:02,649
...that they're all locked up. Right?

495
00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:05,986
- No. No way.
- Wait.

496
00:45:07,362 --> 00:45:08,697
Listen.

497
00:45:11,033 --> 00:45:12,659
I'll make a deaI with you.

498
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:15,412
I'll pay you whatever Cyrus owed you...

499
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:19,416
...if you just help me...

500
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,252
...find my son.

501
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,267
Unbelievable. Get out of my way.

502
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:47,111
Bobby.

503
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:09,633
Get out of the basement.
You need to go upstairs.

504
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:15,472
You need to put on those glasses.

505
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,975
Leave me alone!

506
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,313
That's it. That's a good boy.

507
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:29,987
Bobby.

508
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:33,991
Bobby.

509
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:36,827
Go upstairs and find your father.

510
00:46:38,036 --> 00:46:38,912
Mom?

511
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,330
Go on.

512
00:46:41,749 --> 00:46:43,417
Go upstairs!

513
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,338
Go find Kathy.

514
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Watch out.
Watch out.

515
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:56,638
Bobby! Come on!

516
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:03,353
You don't have to scream, all right? Just...

517
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:05,689
...chill.

518
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:26,960
- This way.
- Hold on. Listen to me.

519
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,673
This will take forever.
This place is just too big.

520
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:38,222
Kathy and I will head up this way.
You two check down there.

521
00:47:38,263 --> 00:47:41,058
- No, I don't think we should split up.
- It's okay.

522
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:45,771
Go in a straight line, turn around.
We'll meet back here in five.

523
00:47:46,522 --> 00:47:49,024
Five. Back here.

524
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,651
Don't touch anything.

525
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:53,112
- I don't want to go with him!
- Go ahead.

526
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:04,498
Let's go back to the ghost thingy.

527
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:08,919
There are ghosts down here.
If you don't believe me, look for yourself.

528
00:48:09,128 --> 00:48:11,171
I told you, I can't see any ghosts.

529
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the hell? Give me those.
Let me see. Why are these open?
I was down here before.
They weren't open.

530
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:24,476
- God! I hate it when they do that!
- Do what?

531
00:48:25,185 --> 00:48:29,565
They wait for you to put your face
up to the glass, then give you...

532
00:48:30,065 --> 00:48:31,900
...a big, fat "boo"!

533
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:33,444
Don't do that!

534
00:48:37,906 --> 00:48:38,949
God.

535
00:48:39,408 --> 00:48:40,659
See it?

536
00:48:41,535 --> 00:48:43,328
- It's, it's...
- A ghost.

537
00:48:43,412 --> 00:48:47,249
Just like I've been saying all night!
Finally, a believer!

538
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:50,919
Ghosts are around us all the time.
Most of them can't hurt us.

539
00:48:51,336 --> 00:48:55,632
Most don't want to.
Ghosts here, ghosts there, no one cares.

540
00:48:55,758 --> 00:48:58,761
But there are exceptions,
like this bad-ass behind me.

541
00:48:58,886 --> 00:49:03,057
Those who die violently stay in
a tortured realm, so that's all they know.

542
00:49:03,557 --> 00:49:04,933
What is he doing?

543
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:08,645
I don't know. I can't see.
I don't have the glasses.

544
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:14,234
I've had it with this. It's time to go.

545
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,653
- Now! Please!
- Don't touch me.

546
00:49:17,696 --> 00:49:19,239
Will you come on?

547
00:49:25,412 --> 00:49:28,123
Come on, ghost boy! Move your ass!
It's time to go.

548
00:49:30,876 --> 00:49:33,879
Dad, slow down. We're going to get lost.

549
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:54,024
Dad!

550
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:04,701
Dad.

551
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:06,703
Listen to me.

552
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:09,373
He's going to be okay.

553
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:12,126
We're going to find him.

554
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:15,212
I am so ready to leave this place.

555
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,048
- Oh, boy.
- What?

556
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:22,094
- That's the symboI of The JackaI.
- What's The JackaI?

557
00:50:22,177 --> 00:50:26,390
The JackaI is the Charlie Manson of ghosts.
If he's out, screw the kid.

558
00:50:26,682 --> 00:50:28,642
We've got to get out of this basement.

559
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,895
Maybe Rafkin was right, and maybe there-

560
00:50:31,937 --> 00:50:33,105
Kathy!

561
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:36,567
Think about what you're saying.

562
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
There is no such thing as ghosts.

563
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:54,918
Kathy.

564
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:58,672
Kathy!

565
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:13,937
What is it? I can't see it!
Tell me where it is!

566
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:16,106
Get off!

567
00:51:18,859 --> 00:51:20,527
Hold on! Stay with me!

568
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,456
Come on, pull!

569
00:51:32,706 --> 00:51:35,709
- Who are you?
- Never mind, just pull.

570
00:51:37,336 --> 00:51:40,672
Shit! Don't speak. Don't move.

571
00:51:42,216 --> 00:51:43,384
Somehow...

572
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,011
...we got behind enemy lines.

573
00:51:55,354 --> 00:51:56,688
Hurry!

574
00:51:56,897 --> 00:51:58,232
Please, hurry!

575
00:52:00,234 --> 00:52:01,902
Hey, little guy.

576
00:52:02,361 --> 00:52:03,987
- How.
- Don't tease the ghosts.

577
00:52:04,029 --> 00:52:07,658
- Will you shut up?
- You shut up. You keep pissing them off.

578
00:52:08,742 --> 00:52:11,412
Go.

579
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,835
- Maggie!
- What?

580
00:52:24,091 --> 00:52:26,760
Where?
I can't see without the glasses, idiot!

581
00:52:27,094 --> 00:52:30,723
Well, I can see.
And I think you should go this way!

582
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:33,267
Go, go!

583
00:52:37,104 --> 00:52:39,064
It's all right. I've got you.

584
00:52:40,482 --> 00:52:41,608
Look at me.

585
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,694
Daddy.

586
00:52:44,278 --> 00:52:45,946
It's okay.

587
00:52:56,457 --> 00:52:58,250
Who the hell are you?

588
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:01,045
And what the hell was that?

589
00:53:01,628 --> 00:53:05,090
My name is Kalina Oretzia.
I'm in the spirit reclamation business.

590
00:53:05,174 --> 00:53:06,175
What?

591
00:53:06,633 --> 00:53:08,302
I free trapped souls. Cyrus-

592
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Forget Cyrus, who traps souls,
for a damn second.
What are you doing here?
Looks to me like I'm saving your ass.

593
00:53:19,271 --> 00:53:22,399
Oh, my God!
It's over there! It's over there!

594
00:53:22,983 --> 00:53:24,568
Give him your glasses.

595
00:53:25,486 --> 00:53:26,487
Come on!

596
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:42,002
Oh, my God.

597
00:53:44,838 --> 00:53:46,340
Unbelievable.

598
00:53:46,465 --> 00:53:48,801
Another one of Cyrus's victims.

599
00:53:49,343 --> 00:53:52,012
I hope to God the barrier spells hold.

600
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,681
Victims?

601
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,768
Cyrus had a nasty habit of enslaving souls.

602
00:53:57,893 --> 00:54:00,771
That's why I'm here.
I intend to set them all free.

603
00:54:00,854 --> 00:54:02,231
Listen to me.

604
00:54:02,856 --> 00:54:04,441
I need to know...

605
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,944
...how you got in here.

606
00:54:07,486 --> 00:54:10,322
I slipped through an opening in the house
when it shifted.

607
00:54:10,406 --> 00:54:13,867
- An opening where?
- It's closed now. It won't happen again.

608
00:54:14,868 --> 00:54:17,538
Let me show you. This is the Arcanum.

609
00:54:18,038 --> 00:54:20,207
Many people died
in the quest for this book.

610
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,669
It was written in the 15th century
by an astrologer named Basileus.

611
00:54:23,752 --> 00:54:26,714
In it, he describes
the making of a certain machine.

612
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:29,216
One that can see into the future.

613
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:31,969
He wrote it while he was under
demonic possession.

614
00:54:32,386 --> 00:54:34,388
I can't believe Cyrus built it.

615
00:54:34,722 --> 00:54:37,891
Built what? What are you talking about?

616
00:54:38,225 --> 00:54:39,893
Basileus's device.

617
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:44,481
We're in the middle of a machine, designed
by the deviI and powered by the dead.

618
00:54:45,524 --> 00:54:46,859
Listen to me.

619
00:54:48,402 --> 00:54:50,821
I don't give a shit about any machine...

620
00:54:51,196 --> 00:54:53,657
...or deviI or Basileus or anything...

621
00:54:54,366 --> 00:54:57,411
...except getting my family
the hell out of this place.

622
00:54:58,203 --> 00:55:01,749
I came here
to set the souls in this house free.

623
00:55:02,082 --> 00:55:05,085
You want help, you have to help me first.

624
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,505
Kathy, can you walk?

625
00:55:11,592 --> 00:55:14,261
Kathy! Oh, no. This can't be happening!

626
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:17,723
- We have to get out of here.
- I'm not going anywhere without my kids.

627
00:55:17,765 --> 00:55:19,349
Try telling him that.

628
00:55:26,273 --> 00:55:27,608
Come on.

629
00:55:38,952 --> 00:55:41,288
This way. Come on.

630
00:55:43,123 --> 00:55:45,459
Stairs. Let's go.

631
00:55:46,794 --> 00:55:49,296
Go. You go!

632
00:55:51,131 --> 00:55:52,800
Don't touch me!

633
00:55:53,133 --> 00:55:54,802
Wait! The glasses!

634
00:55:55,094 --> 00:55:56,804
You'll need these! Catch!

635
00:56:06,939 --> 00:56:08,941
- Good job.
- Sorry.

636
00:56:16,865 --> 00:56:18,700
Perfect. Another dead end.

637
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:21,787
Okay, genius, we found the stairs.
How do we get to them?

638
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:24,039
- Get away.
- What? What do we do now?

639
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Get away from the glass.
- Why?
- Just do it.

640
00:56:52,025 --> 00:56:53,235
Glasses.

641
00:56:59,158 --> 00:57:00,367
Duck!

642
00:57:01,326 --> 00:57:02,786
Move! Go left!

643
00:57:03,036 --> 00:57:06,248
Do something, for Christ's sake!
We're running out of corridors!

644
00:57:06,331 --> 00:57:09,418
Duck! Go left! Go right! Move!

645
00:57:11,336 --> 00:57:12,588
Get down!

646
00:57:17,676 --> 00:57:21,638
Here. We've got to get to the library.
It has spell protection all around it.

647
00:57:22,514 --> 00:57:24,266
Where is that from here?

648
00:57:42,743 --> 00:57:45,120
Can I rely on you not to get me killed?

649
00:57:45,746 --> 00:57:47,331
I guarantee nothing.

650
00:58:01,303 --> 00:58:02,971
See anything?

651
00:58:06,809 --> 00:58:08,435
- Anything?
- No.

652
00:58:10,646 --> 00:58:11,980
Come on.

653
00:58:12,481 --> 00:58:14,733
I think they're just downstairs.

654
00:58:18,654 --> 00:58:19,988
Nothing.

655
00:58:23,075 --> 00:58:26,412
If we get out of this alive,
I've got to get a pay raise.

656
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:29,540
That's a big "if. "

657
00:58:32,835 --> 00:58:34,044
Give me the flare.

658
00:58:37,339 --> 00:58:41,176
What's wrong?
Don't start freaking out now. Come on.

659
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:51,437
What?

660
00:58:55,023 --> 00:58:57,025
- Okay. What?
- Shut up.

661
00:58:57,234 --> 00:58:58,944
Give me the book.

662
00:59:02,531 --> 00:59:04,199
Just back up.

663
00:59:06,618 --> 00:59:08,287
Go. Slow.

664
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- I'm going slow.
- Slow.
Go! Go!
Fast!

665
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:19,757
- What the hell?
- Who the hell?

666
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,717
What the hell are you doing here?

667
00:59:28,724 --> 00:59:29,933
Shit!

668
00:59:33,979 --> 00:59:35,564
Remember me?

669
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:46,325
Thanks for taking your time.

670
00:59:46,408 --> 00:59:48,619
Go down the hall. Turn left, then right.

671
00:59:48,702 --> 00:59:50,788
- Where are we going?
- Trust me, okay?

672
00:59:50,871 --> 00:59:52,748
- Arthur?
- Trust her.

673
00:59:52,831 --> 00:59:54,625
Okay, let's go!

674
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:57,127
- Who the hell is she?
- I'll explain her later.

675
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

676
01:01:03,652 --> 01:01:05,154
What happened to Kathy?

677
01:01:05,237 --> 01:01:06,864
I don't know, she disappeared.

678
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
How do you lose an entire family
in a glass house?

679
01:01:20,836 --> 01:01:22,129
Arthur!

680
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:27,051
Kalina, give me a flare!

681
01:01:34,349 --> 01:01:36,685
Get him! Go! Get up!

682
01:01:36,977 --> 01:01:39,646
This is not the time to be a girI! Run!

683
01:01:40,773 --> 01:01:43,734
Stop dragging your ass, man! Go!

684
01:01:44,276 --> 01:01:46,403
Oh, my God! Go! Run!

685
01:01:46,445 --> 01:01:49,573
Now is not the time
to sit around, Arthur! Run!

686
01:01:49,823 --> 01:01:51,784
Get the door. Close the door!

687
01:01:56,455 --> 01:01:58,499
Arthur, are you all right?

688
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:02,878
God, what's going on here?
Fucking ghosts.

689
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:04,755
I hate this job.

690
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:07,966
They don't like you, either. I wonder why.

691
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:12,846
You got something to say, say it.

692
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:16,183
All right. Let's start with:
This is all your goddamn fault!

693
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:19,144
If you hadn't caught them,
we wouldn't be running from them.

694
01:02:19,186 --> 01:02:21,188
It was his uncle that built the house!

695
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:24,858
You helped him. How could you help him
without knowing what he was doing?

696
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:32,241
- I had my reasons.
- Money, you parasite.

697
01:02:32,324 --> 01:02:36,120
You stole people's souls for money!
How depraved is that?

698
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:39,289
If you haven't noticed, I'm a bit of a freak!

699
01:02:39,498 --> 01:02:42,835
I come within 10 feet of anything dead,
I go into seizures.

700
01:02:42,918 --> 01:02:47,673
I touch somebody, a whole life full of shit
flashes in front of my eyes.

701
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:49,758
So, yeah, I'm depraved.

702
01:02:49,842 --> 01:02:52,386
But Cyrus was my friend,
and he accepted me.

703
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:56,473
He didn't accept you. You're so pathetic!

704
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:59,518
- He used you.
- Shut up, both of you.

705
01:03:00,394 --> 01:03:03,772
Cut him some slack.
What difference does it make?

706
01:03:05,649 --> 01:03:07,526
You didn't tell him, did you?

707
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:10,487
Tell me what? What now?

708
01:03:10,988 --> 01:03:12,823
About the fourth ghost.

709
01:03:15,576 --> 01:03:17,911
Don't do this. I didn't tell him.

710
01:03:18,036 --> 01:03:19,705
He has a right to know.

711
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:24,334
What about the fourth ghost?

712
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:28,589
St. Luke's HospitaI. Six months ago.

713
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:41,018
You're saying my wife's spirit...

714
01:03:41,435 --> 01:03:43,270
...is trapped in this house?

715
01:03:46,106 --> 01:03:47,524
I didn't know you.

716
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:51,612
I didn't know her.
I didn't know she had a husband.

717
01:03:55,699 --> 01:03:59,578
Why? In God's name, why?
Tell me, why her?

718
01:03:59,661 --> 01:04:02,581
I don't know. Cyrus handpicked them,
including your wife.

719
01:04:02,623 --> 01:04:05,459
I figured out who you were
and I've been trying to help you.

720
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:09,963
You call this help? She's right!
This is all your goddamn fault!

721
01:04:10,381 --> 01:04:12,216
Son of a bitch!

722
01:04:14,218 --> 01:04:17,054
You can save her. And your kids, too.

723
01:04:17,388 --> 01:04:20,307
Just listen to me and believe me.

724
01:04:21,225 --> 01:04:22,976
This house is not a house.

725
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:26,146
It is a machine.

726
01:04:28,107 --> 01:04:32,277
A complete and faithfuI re-creation
of Basileus's design.

727
01:04:32,903 --> 01:04:36,407
According to this, there should be
12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.

728
01:04:37,074 --> 01:04:40,244
See these?
They represent the black zodiac.

729
01:04:40,411 --> 01:04:44,039
They represent the ghosts that
Cyrus needed to catch: The First-Born Son.

730
01:04:44,123 --> 01:04:45,624
I don't want to play.

731
01:04:47,501 --> 01:04:48,752
The Torso.

732
01:04:51,672 --> 01:04:52,881
The Bound Woman.

733
01:04:55,801 --> 01:04:57,469
The Withered Lover.

734
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:00,305
Jean.

735
01:05:06,562 --> 01:05:08,856
Bobby. I love you.

736
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:12,776
The Torn Prince.

737
01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:17,281
The Angry Princess.

738
01:05:17,489 --> 01:05:18,824
I'm sorry.

739
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,784
The Pilgrimess.

740
01:05:22,327 --> 01:05:24,163
The Great Child and the Dire Mother.

741
01:05:26,832 --> 01:05:28,459
The Hammer.

742
01:05:31,128 --> 01:05:34,506
And here, the sign of Hell's Winter:
The JackaI.

743
01:05:37,593 --> 01:05:39,053
And The Juggernaut.

744
01:05:42,056 --> 01:05:44,266
The machine required the energy...

745
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:47,227
...of these specific spirits
in order to bring it to life.

746
01:05:47,478 --> 01:05:50,314
Once it engages,
the spirits are released one by one.

747
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:52,816
The house then draws them to its center.

748
01:05:52,858 --> 01:05:56,278
Each one adds its energy to the machine,
powering it up.

749
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:59,782
Powering it up for what?

750
01:05:59,865 --> 01:06:01,784
To open the Ocularis Infernum.

751
01:06:01,867 --> 01:06:03,577
What's that?

752
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,953
It's Latin.

753
01:06:05,037 --> 01:06:08,499
Ocularis Infernum. The Eye of Hell?

754
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,502
Very good.

755
01:06:11,543 --> 01:06:16,006
The Eye of Hell. I'm stuck in a glass house
with crazy white people...

756
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:17,091
Go on.

757
01:06:17,174 --> 01:06:20,594
In hell, there is an eye
that sees everything, the past, the future...

758
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:23,013
...heaven and earth,
the blessed, the damned.

759
01:06:23,097 --> 01:06:26,600
If knowledge is power,
then the man who controls the Ocularis...

760
01:06:26,683 --> 01:06:28,936
...would be the most powerfuI
man on earth.

761
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:31,772
Your uncle.

762
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:33,524
Great.

763
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,526
So...

764
01:06:36,026 --> 01:06:39,113
...how many ghosts have been set free?

765
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:42,282
Eleven. And the house needs twelve.

766
01:06:42,533 --> 01:06:46,370
No. Damon said something about thirteen.

767
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:48,372
That there are thirteen ghosts.

768
01:06:48,497 --> 01:06:50,666
The thirteenth ghost is a faiI-safe.

769
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:55,838
To stop the process, the house needs
a sacrifice of life instead of death.

770
01:06:56,422 --> 01:06:58,799
A willing, human sacrifice.

771
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:02,052
A sacrifice of the broken heart.

772
01:07:02,386 --> 01:07:05,389
The only ghost to be created
out of an act of pure love.

773
01:07:05,764 --> 01:07:07,558
You're the thirteenth ghost.

774
01:07:10,269 --> 01:07:13,731
The thirteenth spirit stands before the eye
at the finaI configuration.

775
01:07:13,772 --> 01:07:16,775
As the eye opens,
the spirit uses the power of life...

776
01:07:17,234 --> 01:07:19,278
...to short-circuit the system.

777
01:07:19,737 --> 01:07:22,072
Uses the power of life how?

778
01:07:22,448 --> 01:07:24,074
By leaping into the eye.

779
01:07:24,158 --> 01:07:27,453
And Arthur's supposed to take this leap?
No fucking way, lady.

780
01:07:27,828 --> 01:07:30,414
That's suicide. I won't let you do it.

781
01:07:30,497 --> 01:07:34,168
You need to come up with something else.
That's not working.

782
01:07:34,918 --> 01:07:37,087
Love is the most powerfuI energy.

783
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:38,756
Meaning?

784
01:07:39,631 --> 01:07:43,844
In order for you to save your children,
you must trade your life for theirs.

785
01:07:48,223 --> 01:07:49,767
Let me see this.

786
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:52,352
There's got to be a better way.

787
01:07:53,729 --> 01:07:55,230
I don't read Latin.

788
01:07:55,314 --> 01:07:58,525
Well, we can try it the old-fashioned way,
my personaI favorite.

789
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:01,403
Nobody will be here
to brag about it afterwards.

790
01:08:01,487 --> 01:08:04,990
We need to come up with
a game plan soon. Time's running out.

791
01:08:05,491 --> 01:08:07,326
Are you going to blow the place up?

792
01:08:07,451 --> 01:08:09,536
The last ghost is about to be released.

793
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:13,332
- I know why you feeI you have to do this.
- Get away from me.

794
01:08:13,415 --> 01:08:17,419
Psychics call it a "linking. "
We linked earlier. I saw everything...

795
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:19,963
...about Jean, about you.

796
01:08:20,005 --> 01:08:23,717
Shut up.
I'm not going to listen to this from you.

797
01:08:24,134 --> 01:08:26,261
Kalina is talking about suicide.

798
01:08:26,345 --> 01:08:28,222
Anything to save my kids.

799
01:08:28,389 --> 01:08:31,475
It doesn't add up.
It doesn't make any sense.

800
01:08:31,517 --> 01:08:33,227
There's got to be a better way.

801
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:35,896
"Doesn't add up"?
What does add up here, Dennis?

802
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:38,440
How much of this equation
makes any sense at all?

803
01:08:38,649 --> 01:08:41,110
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

804
01:08:42,653 --> 01:08:45,072
AII I can think about are my kids.

805
01:08:46,615 --> 01:08:48,784
I don't even know if they're alive.

806
01:08:51,245 --> 01:08:53,497
Then let's go out there and find out.

807
01:08:54,498 --> 01:08:57,584
One last time,
while there's still time, you and me.

808
01:09:08,554 --> 01:09:09,930
Kalina...

809
01:09:10,013 --> 01:09:13,684
...no matter what I decide to do,
or what happens to any of us...

810
01:09:14,059 --> 01:09:16,395
...are you sure
you can you stop that machine?

811
01:09:17,271 --> 01:09:20,649
I've got enough explosives
to blow us back to the 15th century.

812
01:09:23,068 --> 01:09:24,361
Okay.

813
01:09:26,405 --> 01:09:29,241
- How many flares do you have left?
- One, why?

814
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,160
We're going out again.

815
01:09:31,243 --> 01:09:34,788
No fucking way, Arthur.
You're going to get yourself killed.

816
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:36,707
Not if we take that.

817
01:09:39,126 --> 01:09:42,713
Ten minutes
untiI the ectoplasmic shit hits the fan.

818
01:09:45,549 --> 01:09:47,217
Go.

819
01:09:49,386 --> 01:09:51,722
We'll go down and buy you some time.

820
01:09:51,847 --> 01:09:53,849
After you, Captain America.

821
01:10:06,111 --> 01:10:08,530
Damn. I just got my nails done.

822
01:10:09,406 --> 01:10:11,075
Here. Put these on.

823
01:10:11,909 --> 01:10:13,619
Come on, let's go!

824
01:10:48,278 --> 01:10:50,030
"There's no place like home. "

825
01:10:50,114 --> 01:10:53,283
"There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

826
01:10:53,492 --> 01:10:55,494
"There's no place like home. "

827
01:10:55,828 --> 01:10:58,914
Knock it off, Dennis.
Just keep your eyes open.

828
01:11:00,666 --> 01:11:02,918
I sure hope I don't bleed to death.

829
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,963
That would suck.

830
01:11:08,006 --> 01:11:09,341
Rotate.

831
01:11:19,184 --> 01:11:20,978
Is that half the lawyer?

832
01:11:21,145 --> 01:11:22,980
Here, take this. Move it.

833
01:11:23,021 --> 01:11:25,649
Oh, my God. He definitely looked better.

834
01:11:57,681 --> 01:11:59,850
Oh, my God. Shit.

835
01:12:02,352 --> 01:12:03,645
GirI, hurry up!

836
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

837
01:12:31,507 --> 01:12:34,510
- Ram him!
- He's swinging for the fences!

838
01:12:44,645 --> 01:12:47,815
Kalina, get over here!
This flare shit ain't working! Hurry up!

839
01:13:22,516 --> 01:13:23,809
Where is it?

840
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:26,937
Where is it?

841
01:13:27,438 --> 01:13:28,731
Kalina?

842
01:13:28,939 --> 01:13:32,526
Why are you so mad at me?
I did everything you asked me to do.

843
01:13:32,651 --> 01:13:35,112
I killed Damon, I stole his spells.

844
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,198
I made sure your pathetic nephew
didn't get himself killed!

845
01:13:38,282 --> 01:13:39,658
Kalina!

846
01:13:41,285 --> 01:13:43,203
Where are the spells?

847
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,419
You're not mad at me, are you?

848
01:13:52,713 --> 01:13:53,964
Of course not.

849
01:13:55,257 --> 01:13:57,468
- What is it?
- Oh, shit.

850
01:14:04,808 --> 01:14:06,560
There's only room for one of us.

851
01:14:06,643 --> 01:14:08,353
What are you doing?

852
01:14:08,645 --> 01:14:12,316
Don't worry, I've been looking for a reason
to like myself for a long time.

853
01:14:12,357 --> 01:14:13,901
Dennis, don't do this!

854
01:14:13,984 --> 01:14:16,862
Hey, bro. You ain't nothing but a bitch!

855
01:14:19,573 --> 01:14:21,241
Dennis, no!

856
01:14:40,177 --> 01:14:41,553
Oh, my God.

857
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:34,940
What do we do now?

858
01:15:35,023 --> 01:15:38,193
Your nephew believes
that sacrificing himself will save his kids.

859
01:15:38,277 --> 01:15:40,988
But he won't do it
unless his kids are in jeopardy.

860
01:15:41,071 --> 01:15:43,657
- Well, put them in jeopardy.
- What?

861
01:15:45,409 --> 01:15:47,411
- Why not?
- But they're kids.

862
01:15:47,453 --> 01:15:49,788
Greatness requires sacrifice.

863
01:15:51,749 --> 01:15:53,584
Now, I have a job to do.

864
01:15:54,626 --> 01:15:56,170
And so have you.

865
01:15:58,589 --> 01:16:00,716
Do it. Do it!

866
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:02,384
Yes.

867
01:16:07,306 --> 01:16:09,099
And now to finish this.

868
01:17:05,531 --> 01:17:07,157
Oh, my God. Jean.

869
01:17:09,785 --> 01:17:11,620
I loved you so much.

870
01:17:14,206 --> 01:17:15,791
I miss you.

871
01:17:17,793 --> 01:17:19,378
Miss you.

872
01:17:20,504 --> 01:17:22,673
I'm nothing without you.

873
01:17:33,016 --> 01:17:36,186
Don't go.

874
01:17:36,395 --> 01:17:38,021
Don't go.

875
01:17:51,118 --> 01:17:52,995
Fetch the book.

876
01:18:03,047 --> 01:18:06,050
Cyrus! What are you doing?

877
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:08,886
You just can't teach some people.

878
01:18:09,011 --> 01:18:13,348
I thought I told you,
greatness requires sacrifice.

879
01:18:22,232 --> 01:18:23,984
- Kathy!
- Bobby, don't look.

880
01:18:24,068 --> 01:18:26,236
I don't want to look.

881
01:18:28,864 --> 01:18:31,033
Kathy, I'm scared!

882
01:18:34,995 --> 01:18:36,330
Kathy!

883
01:18:36,413 --> 01:18:38,207
Kathy! Bobby!

884
01:18:40,918 --> 01:18:42,002
Daddy!

885
01:18:42,252 --> 01:18:43,587
Bobby!

886
01:18:44,421 --> 01:18:46,256
Dad, help!

887
01:18:51,428 --> 01:18:52,805
Oh, my...

888
01:18:58,185 --> 01:19:01,438
Make it stop, Dad! Make it stop!

889
01:19:18,247 --> 01:19:21,250
This house is not a house. It's a machine...

890
01:19:24,294 --> 01:19:26,255
...designed by the devil...

891
01:19:27,464 --> 01:19:29,299
...and powered by the dead.

892
01:19:33,053 --> 01:19:37,182
According to Basileus, there should be
12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.

893
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:42,062
They represent the black zodiac.

894
01:19:44,314 --> 01:19:47,276
They represent the ghosts
that Cyrus needed to catch:

895
01:19:48,986 --> 01:19:51,155
- The First-Born Son.
- One.

896
01:19:52,906 --> 01:19:54,575
- The Torso.
- Two.

897
01:19:54,908 --> 01:19:56,827
- The Bound Woman.
- Three.

898
01:19:56,869 --> 01:19:58,662
- The Withered Lover.
- Four.

899
01:19:58,954 --> 01:20:00,622
The Torn Prince.

900
01:20:00,914 --> 01:20:03,375
The Angry Princess. The Pilgrimess.

901
01:20:03,417 --> 01:20:05,627
The Great Child and the Dire Mother.

902
01:20:05,878 --> 01:20:09,673
The Hammer. The Jackal.
And The Juggernaut.

903
01:20:10,007 --> 01:20:11,467
Twelve.

904
01:20:18,474 --> 01:20:20,142
You're the thirteenth ghost.

905
01:20:25,022 --> 01:20:26,857
If I'm the thirteenth...

906
01:20:42,706 --> 01:20:45,626
You son of a bitch!

907
01:20:48,921 --> 01:20:51,715
Release my kids, you bastard!

908
01:20:56,011 --> 01:20:58,514
Damn you! You're nothing, Arthur!

909
01:20:58,931 --> 01:21:01,308
Do you hear? You loser!

910
01:21:01,392 --> 01:21:04,061
I've dedicated my entire life to this.

911
01:21:04,269 --> 01:21:06,772
Every waking moment, for years.

912
01:21:06,939 --> 01:21:10,734
Have you ever shown
that kind of dedication? Have you?

913
01:21:11,318 --> 01:21:14,822
The world has no time
for little people like you.

914
01:21:14,947 --> 01:21:17,658
It needs people
who are willing to do anything!

915
01:21:19,243 --> 01:21:21,078
Anything for greatness.

916
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:29,586
You don't have a choice this time, Arthur.

917
01:21:29,753 --> 01:21:31,630
You will make that leap.

918
01:21:33,549 --> 01:21:36,385
The machine requires
a ghost to be created...

919
01:21:36,468 --> 01:21:38,762
...out of an act of pure love.

920
01:21:39,012 --> 01:21:42,433
That's why I chose you, nephew.
You and your pathetic family.

921
01:21:42,474 --> 01:21:44,184
Make it stop, Dad!

922
01:21:44,268 --> 01:21:48,272
Congratulations,
you get to become the thirteenth ghost.

923
01:21:49,022 --> 01:21:50,482
Get on your feet.

924
01:21:55,028 --> 01:21:56,613
Come on!

925
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

926
01:23:02,679 --> 01:23:05,516
Trust me, Arthur. It's not over yet.

927
01:23:06,225 --> 01:23:07,768
You can finish this.

928
01:23:10,104 --> 01:23:12,106
You still have the power in you.

929
01:23:13,524 --> 01:23:17,361
It's just a matter of how you use it.
Go to your kids. They need you.

930
01:23:26,662 --> 01:23:28,497
Dad! Help!

931
01:23:29,873 --> 01:23:32,209
Daddy, don't! Don't do it!

932
01:23:40,384 --> 01:23:41,844
Oh, fuck!

933
01:23:47,933 --> 01:23:49,184
Dad!

934
01:23:58,944 --> 01:24:00,237
Don't move!

935
01:24:04,324 --> 01:24:05,826
Keep your heads down!

936
01:24:08,287 --> 01:24:09,496
Hold on!

937
01:24:57,002 --> 01:24:58,587
Everybody okay?

938
01:25:01,215 --> 01:25:02,716
You okay?

939
01:25:05,469 --> 01:25:07,638
How did you know we'd be safe here?

940
01:25:09,098 --> 01:25:10,432
I didn't.

941
01:25:10,641 --> 01:25:13,560
I just wasn't about to leave you guys.

942
01:25:14,144 --> 01:25:16,313
I love you both so much.

943
01:25:28,826 --> 01:25:30,119
Mom?

944
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:35,165
I love you guys.

945
01:25:41,505 --> 01:25:42,965
I love you.

946
01:25:55,602 --> 01:25:57,020
This is it for me.

947
01:25:57,062 --> 01:25:59,648
I am on the first plane back to Newark.

948
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:04,778
I am sorry, family, Kathy,
Bobby, Uncle, ghosts...

949
01:26:04,987 --> 01:26:06,780
...I am sick of this nanny shit.

950
01:26:06,864 --> 01:26:10,659
I've had it.
This was not in the job description. I quit!
