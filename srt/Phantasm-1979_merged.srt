1
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,830
Oh, baby.

2
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,229
Tommy.

3
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:57,930
Tommy.

4
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:10,364
Mmm. That was great, baby.

5
00:02:37,246 --> 00:02:38,746
Jody.

6
00:02:39,546 --> 00:02:42,231
- Hi, Reg.
- How's it goin'?

7
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:46,441
Tommy's gone.

8
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:51,346
It's, uh... it's a hell of a way
to end a trio.

9
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:54,945
It's hard to believe... he killed himself.

10
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:59,446
Yeah, I, uh... I'm gonna go visit somebody.
I'll catch ya inside.

11
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,131
Yeah.

12
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

13
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:35,463
The funeral is about to begin... sir.

14
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:39,462
Okay.

15
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:41,963
Sir.

16
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:02,512
It was a good idea not to let
your little brother come to the funeral

17
00:07:02,612 --> 00:07:04,412
and see Tommy like this.

18
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:08,413
Yeah, after Mom and Dad's funeral,
he had nightmares for weeks.

19
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:17,662
And forgive us our debts
as we forgive our debtors.

20
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:22,496
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

21
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:27,572
Hey, I don't like this place.

22
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:30,746
Well, say goodbye to Tommy.

23
00:08:31,395 --> 00:08:33,768
Let's just get the hell out of here.

24
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:15,579
- Hi, Michael.
- Hi. Uh... is your grandmother home?

25
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,763
Sure. Come in.

26
00:10:25,746 --> 00:10:29,589
Grandmother. Michael has returned
and wishes to speak with you.

27
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:42,396
Grandmother is pleased you've come
and wants to know what's bothering you.

28
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:45,382
Uh, tell her that I, um...

29
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:46,864
She can hear you.

30
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:49,429
Oh, yeah.

31
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:52,828
Uh, it's Jody again.

32
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:54,650
I found out that he's leaving.

33
00:11:39,677 --> 00:11:42,047
I think it's one of these headers in here.

34
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:58,429
Hey, Toby! Hey.

35
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:02,107
- So what brings you back?
- Tommy.

36
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:04,662
Yeah, yeah.

37
00:12:04,762 --> 00:12:08,328
Well, I just don't get off on funerals, man.
They give me the creeps.

38
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:11,929
I just wanted to tell you I heard
about your folks. I'm really sorry.

39
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,429
Yeah, thank you, man. That's, uh...

40
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:17,562
In two years I guess you can
just about get over anything.

41
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:21,412
- So I hear you've been out on the road.
- Yeah.

42
00:12:21,612 --> 00:12:23,278
How come you're hanging around this dump?

43
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:25,545
Well, I'm taking care
of the kid, you know.

44
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:30,294
Shit, I think after, uh, all that action,
this town would drive you nuts.

45
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:33,812
You're damn right. Hell, the kid's 13 now.

46
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:36,963
Yeah, I'm thinking of sending him
off to live with his aunt.

47
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:39,546
<i>But I'll tell you,
he sure ain't gonna like it.</i>

48
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:44,812
<i>I mean, as it is, he follows me everywhere.
It's like he knows I'm gonna leave.</i>

49
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:47,412
<i>He's a tough little kid. I love him.</i>

50
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:49,597
<i>I'm gonna miss him.</i>

51
00:12:57,946 --> 00:13:00,012
Grandmother has told you
before not to worry.

52
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,712
If he does leave, he'll take you with him.

53
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:05,980
- God, I hope she's right.
- She always is.

54
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:11,162
Uh, there's something else.

55
00:13:11,862 --> 00:13:14,133
I'm really scared
about something that I did.

56
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:18,595
I was messing around up at Morningside
Cemetery, and I saw something.

57
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:20,780
Something really scary.

58
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

59
00:14:14,712 --> 00:14:17,896
Michael, grandmother
wants to play a little game.

60
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:21,278
Wow! How'd you do that?

61
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:23,079
Put your hand in the box.

62
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:28,163
- Well, what's in it?
- Just put your hand in the black box.

63
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:32,462
Okay, but what's in it?

64
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:36,745
Hey, this thing really hurts!

65
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:39,045
Don't fear, Michael.

66
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,862
- I can't get my hand out.
- Don't fear.

67
00:14:43,412 --> 00:14:46,646
- Give me back my hand!
- Don't fear!

68
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:56,558
It was simply reflection.
Fear is the killer.

69
00:14:56,658 --> 00:14:59,204
That's what grandmother
wants you to learn.

70
00:14:59,978 --> 00:15:02,246
Boy, that really hurt.

71
00:15:04,712 --> 00:15:06,813
It was all in your mind.

72
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:12,145
Oh, yeah.

73
00:15:21,945 --> 00:15:24,112
Come and visit us again soon.

74
00:15:24,212 --> 00:15:25,730
Yeah.

75
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:18,778
- Hiya, Reg.
- Writing a new tune?

76
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,962
Yeah, working on it.

77
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:31,063
<i># I'm just a-sittin' here at midnight #</i>

78
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:37,862
<i># And I'll be sitting here 'til noon #</i>

79
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,961
<i># You see, my lady left me lonely #</i>

80
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:47,480
<i># Yes, she did #</i>

81
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:51,979
<i># My baby left me blue #</i>

82
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:20,928
All right. We're hot as love, you know.

83
00:18:58,195 --> 00:19:00,695
Well, let's see.

84
00:19:01,495 --> 00:19:04,480
This is, uh... just right up the street.

85
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,596
This is, uh...

86
00:20:07,995 --> 00:20:11,796
- kinda spooky, isn't it?
- No, it's exciting.

87
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,995
So, uh...

88
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:18,196
what's the only thing to do in this town?

89
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:21,984
Well, it's something...

90
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,779
Wow.

91
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:06,029
Wow.

92
00:22:20,178 --> 00:22:22,429
What the heck?

93
00:22:23,028 --> 00:22:25,494
Wait here. It's my little brother.

94
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,012
I think he's got some kind of a problem.

95
00:22:49,378 --> 00:22:50,962
Mike!

96
00:22:53,728 --> 00:22:55,701
What's wrong with you, man?

97
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:58,894
There's something up there.
I know it. I saw it!

98
00:22:58,994 --> 00:23:00,244
What?

99
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:02,661
Okay, look, I was following you guys.

100
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:05,845
I didn't mean any harm,
but it's out there and it's gonna get me!

101
00:23:06,944 --> 00:23:09,861
- What's out there?
- I don't know.

102
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:12,798
It was little and brown
and low to the ground.

103
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:15,744
It was probably just a gopher in heat.

104
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:18,112
It wasn't any gopher!

105
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:20,394
Where's that girl, anyway?

106
00:23:20,494 --> 00:23:23,032
Well, she's waiting back there
for me, you idiot.

107
00:23:24,745 --> 00:23:26,745
Did you hear that?

108
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:29,362
Eh, it's only the wind.

109
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,944
You better go get her before it gets her.

110
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:36,703
You got some kind of an overactive
imagination or something, man?

111
00:23:37,244 --> 00:23:40,112
Look, tell you what.

112
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:44,978
You go on home.
I'll talk to you when I get back.

113
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:49,310
- You sure you're gonna be okay?
- Ah, get out of here.

114
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

115
00:27:30,827 --> 00:27:34,262
Did that chick that I left with
last night ever come back in here?

116
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:37,277
What happened? You get a hold
of something you couldn't handle?

117
00:27:37,377 --> 00:27:40,978
Nah, she just ditched out on me, I guess.

118
00:27:41,777 --> 00:27:43,789
We were...

119
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,785
messing around out there at Morningside.

120
00:27:46,885 --> 00:27:49,978
- The funeral parlor?
- Yeah. Cemetery.

121
00:28:20,477 --> 00:28:23,361
Jody? Is that you?

122
00:29:27,194 --> 00:29:28,978
You hit my fucking foot, man.

123
00:29:29,177 --> 00:29:31,929
Oh, damn. I know you're not gonna
believe this, but these things were here.

124
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:34,093
Right in the garage
and they were gonna get me.

125
00:29:34,193 --> 00:29:35,964
Ah, gimme a break, will ya?

126
00:29:36,064 --> 00:29:39,728
They were jumping on the car
and making these weird sounds.

127
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:42,477
Sure it wasn't that retarded kid,
Timmy, up the street?

128
00:29:42,577 --> 00:29:45,881
No, it was the same thing
that chased me last night.

129
00:29:46,011 --> 00:29:48,278
Well, what are we gonna do?

130
00:29:49,994 --> 00:29:51,879
You're crazy, man.

131
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

132
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,912
Um...

133
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:55,645
Oh, shit.

134
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

135
00:40:20,476 --> 00:40:22,393
I've gotta talk to you.

136
00:40:22,493 --> 00:40:24,777
And it's in that box?

137
00:40:25,027 --> 00:40:26,611
Yep.

138
00:40:47,977 --> 00:40:50,410
Okay. I believe you.

139
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,661
Jesus!

140
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,245
What's goin' on up there?

141
00:40:57,345 --> 00:40:59,728
Well, there's something I didn't tell ya.

142
00:41:00,427 --> 00:41:04,327
I was spyin' on Tommy's funeral
from the Groves with your binoculars.

143
00:41:04,427 --> 00:41:06,650
And after everybody had left,

144
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,363
that Tall Man picked up
Tommy's coffin all by himself

145
00:41:10,463 --> 00:41:12,127
and put it in the hearse and drove off.

146
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:15,427
You're crazy!
I helped carry that sucker myself.

147
00:41:15,527 --> 00:41:17,728
It must've weighed over 500 pounds.

148
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:25,128
I can't figure this thing out.

149
00:41:26,327 --> 00:41:29,928
But I do know one thing.
Something weird is going on up there.

150
00:41:31,027 --> 00:41:33,427
We're goin' for the sheriff.
Go get your evidence.

151
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:35,461
All right!

152
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,594
That's funny.

153
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

154
00:42:16,443 --> 00:42:19,731
Jody! Jody!

155
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,344
What the...

156
00:42:35,326 --> 00:42:37,415
The garbage disposal.

157
00:42:38,261 --> 00:42:39,914
Come on.

158
00:42:51,677 --> 00:42:54,176
Ready? Go!

159
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,661
Would you look at that?

160
00:43:19,211 --> 00:43:21,011
Hey, guys.

161
00:43:22,259 --> 00:43:24,911
I thought I'd come over
and see what was goin' on

162
00:43:25,011 --> 00:43:26,727
before the kids got out of summer school.

163
00:43:26,827 --> 00:43:29,110
Mike, you wanna ride along with me today?

164
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:33,757
It's pretty warm outside and the ice cream's
gonna be flying fast and furious.

165
00:43:33,977 --> 00:43:37,593
Remember how good you were
at crowd control last time?

166
00:43:37,693 --> 00:43:38,960
Hey, what's goin' on here?

167
00:44:07,927 --> 00:44:10,510
What the hell is goin' on?

168
00:44:11,509 --> 00:44:14,076
Here, you keep that.

169
00:44:14,176 --> 00:44:18,078
Now remember, you don't aim a gun
at a man unless you intend to shoot him.

170
00:44:18,777 --> 00:44:22,577
And you don't shoot a man
unless you intend to kill him.

171
00:44:23,276 --> 00:44:25,477
No warning shots.

172
00:44:25,577 --> 00:44:27,176
- Hey, you listening to me?
- Yeah.

173
00:44:27,276 --> 00:44:30,277
No warning shots.
Warning shots are bullshit.

174
00:44:30,577 --> 00:44:33,577
You shoot to kill
or you don't shoot at all.

175
00:44:33,977 --> 00:44:38,078
Now you'll be safe here.
Lock all the doors and windows.

176
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:42,777
- And don't follow me.
- You sure you're gonna be okay with that?

177
00:44:42,877 --> 00:44:46,677
I'm just gonna go up there and take
a look around. Nobody's gonna see me.

178
00:44:47,276 --> 00:44:51,995
But, heck, a Colt Army issue
will put a man down and keep him there.

179
00:44:56,343 --> 00:44:59,844
Remember that broken basement
window around by the side.

180
00:45:00,443 --> 00:45:02,528
And be careful.

181
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

182
00:48:47,943 --> 00:48:50,328
All right, who's in there?

183
00:48:55,343 --> 00:48:56,928
Mike?

184
00:49:02,543 --> 00:49:05,211
Damn door latch. Get in.

185
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,043
Oh, here it comes!

186
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:16,577
There's nobody drivin' that mother!

187
00:49:21,343 --> 00:49:23,578
The pump's in the backseat.

188
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:29,477
Okay. Slow down,
and let him ride right up on our ass.

189
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:42,077
There was nobody...
there was nobody driving!

190
00:49:44,676 --> 00:49:46,993
I'm gonna get that bastard.

191
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:57,361
Oh, Jesus.

192
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:06,843
All right, speed up.
I want to put a few in the engine.

193
00:50:06,943 --> 00:50:08,529
Okay.

194
00:50:13,993 --> 00:50:16,177
Holy shit!

195
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,742
It's one of those dwarves.

196
00:51:07,842 --> 00:51:09,638
It went right through it.

197
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:27,445
Tommy!

198
00:51:30,092 --> 00:51:31,611
Reggie.

199
00:51:35,026 --> 00:51:36,911
We got one of 'em.

200
00:51:40,326 --> 00:51:43,111
Uh, on Colton in the Groves.

201
00:51:45,326 --> 00:51:48,011
All right. Uh, Reg?

202
00:51:50,026 --> 00:51:52,111
Bring your truck.

203
00:51:55,243 --> 00:51:59,257
Holy Jesus!
You didn't tell me the dwarf was Tommy.

204
00:51:59,876 --> 00:52:03,377
Hell, we buried him on Monday,
and look what they did to him.

205
00:52:03,876 --> 00:52:07,760
He's only three feet long!
He must still weigh 200 pounds.

206
00:52:09,276 --> 00:52:11,876
What's all this yellow shit
coming out of his head?

207
00:52:11,976 --> 00:52:14,127
Careful. Get him in there.

208
00:52:16,043 --> 00:52:18,828
- Better padlock it.
- Yeah.

209
00:52:22,643 --> 00:52:26,227
This guy's not gonna leak
all over my ice cream, is he?

210
00:52:28,842 --> 00:52:30,943
We'll see you back at the house.

211
00:52:31,043 --> 00:52:32,595
Right.

212
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You boys back yet?

213
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:17,159
Jesus Christ, Myrtle.
You almost gave me a coronary.

214
00:53:17,409 --> 00:53:19,994
But I just can't figure out why.

215
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:26,909
Why they're taking these bodies
and crushing them down to half size.

216
00:53:27,209 --> 00:53:28,610
Crushing 'em.

217
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:30,926
What about Mom and Dad?

218
00:53:31,825 --> 00:53:33,910
They're up there too.

219
00:53:42,959 --> 00:53:45,793
Hey, just forget about that.

220
00:53:47,376 --> 00:53:48,877
Okay.

221
00:53:49,676 --> 00:53:52,076
I see it. I see it all now.

222
00:53:52,576 --> 00:53:56,477
What we gotta do is we gotta
snag that tall dude,

223
00:53:56,577 --> 00:53:58,376
and stomp the shit out of him.

224
00:53:58,476 --> 00:54:01,477
And we'll find out what the hell
is going on up there.

225
00:54:02,276 --> 00:54:06,642
Yeah. We'll lay that sucker out flat and
drive a stake through his goddamn heart!

226
00:54:07,092 --> 00:54:09,927
You gotta be shittin' me, man.
That mother's strong.

227
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,377
Hey, hold on. First thing is,
I want Mike out of here.

228
00:54:17,176 --> 00:54:20,377
Reg, you take him over to Sally's,
the antique store.

229
00:54:20,477 --> 00:54:22,776
He'll be safe there. Then hustle on back.

230
00:54:22,876 --> 00:54:25,812
And, Mike, no arguments.

231
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:37,459
Jody sure sounded strange on the phone.

232
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:39,260
I hope he's feeling okay.

233
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,844
Sally, did you see these new settings?

234
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:46,244
Oh, these are nice.

235
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:50,609
You know, I think I'm gonna lock up.

236
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,559
Michael, when you get sleepy,
I've got a bed made up for you in back.

237
00:56:27,909 --> 00:56:29,609
- You have to take me home.
- But why?

238
00:56:29,709 --> 00:56:32,210
No questions. You must take me home.

239
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

240
00:57:39,693 --> 00:57:42,078
Oh, my God. Pull over.

241
00:57:47,892 --> 00:57:51,760
Stay in the car and don't get out.
I'll be right back.

242
00:57:53,276 --> 00:57:55,861
Michael, wait a minute.

243
00:58:02,243 --> 00:58:04,511
Is that Reggie's truck?

244
00:59:03,459 --> 00:59:05,976
Let's get out of here, quick!

245
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:08,559
- Michael, what is going on?
- Just get me home.

246
00:59:11,842 --> 00:59:14,328
What the hell is that?

247
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:19,658
Oh, shit!

248
00:59:22,709 --> 00:59:24,710
Get out of here.

249
00:59:26,826 --> 00:59:28,666
Don't open it!

250
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:30,560
No!

251
01:00:49,542 --> 01:00:51,827
Oh, God.

252
01:01:03,342 --> 01:01:05,827
It got Sally and Suzy.

253
01:01:07,242 --> 01:01:08,744
What?

254
01:01:09,743 --> 01:01:12,049
Up at Morningside.

255
01:01:12,149 --> 01:01:14,227
And Reggie too.

256
01:01:23,342 --> 01:01:25,342
You better get on up to your room.

257
01:01:25,442 --> 01:01:27,398
- I'm goin' with you.
- Nope.

258
01:01:27,498 --> 01:01:30,026
I'm not lettin' you go by yourself.

259
01:01:30,126 --> 01:01:32,611
Let me go, goddamn it!

260
01:01:35,026 --> 01:01:38,325
Son of a bitch!
You're not lettin' me go, are ya?

261
01:01:38,425 --> 01:01:41,793
You're never coming back,
you goddamn bastard!

262
01:01:50,776 --> 01:01:53,060
Don't leave me alone!

263
01:01:55,159 --> 01:01:57,444
Open the damn door!

264
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

265
01:04:36,242 --> 01:04:38,727
I've been waiting for you.

266
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,510
He has to be in there.

267
01:08:03,242 --> 01:08:05,197
I'm sorry, Daddy...

268
01:08:06,543 --> 01:08:08,628
but we had to.

269
01:08:30,576 --> 01:08:32,177
Oh, my God!

270
01:08:43,225 --> 01:08:45,726
- Jody?
- Yeah?

271
01:08:48,497 --> 01:08:50,510
I opened up his...

272
01:08:51,925 --> 01:08:53,925
Forget it.

273
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:56,510
Come on.

274
01:08:59,425 --> 01:09:01,926
There's this door down here...

275
01:09:03,025 --> 01:09:05,611
and I'll bet there's something behind it.

276
01:09:07,924 --> 01:09:09,709
Let's take a look then.

277
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:38,558
Well, that's the door.

278
01:09:39,357 --> 01:09:42,098
- Hey, man, I don't know...
- Hey!

279
01:09:42,198 --> 01:09:46,458
- Hi, guys.
- Reg! You ain't dead.

280
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:49,560
No, and I ain't
three foot two yet, either.

281
01:09:50,858 --> 01:09:53,459
- What's goin' on?
- Hey, man, I don't know.

282
01:09:53,658 --> 01:09:56,758
I've been hidin' in a casket,
playin' like a stiff.

283
01:09:56,858 --> 01:09:58,658
But I did find the girls.

284
01:09:58,758 --> 01:10:04,158
I found Sally and Sue, and a couple
other girls I never even saw before.

285
01:10:04,258 --> 01:10:06,808
- Were they dead?
- No.

286
01:10:06,908 --> 01:10:11,075
I snuck 'em out a window, and they took off
through the bushes like scared rabbits.

287
01:10:11,175 --> 01:10:12,975
All right.

288
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:16,576
Well, after you, my friend.

289
01:10:17,175 --> 01:10:19,561
You be my guest, man.

290
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:19,410
Jesus.

291
01:11:21,325 --> 01:11:23,159
Dwarves!

292
01:11:29,775 --> 01:11:32,730
God, Reggie! Look at this.

293
01:11:41,142 --> 01:11:42,577
Don't fear.

294
01:11:57,842 --> 01:11:59,378
Wow.

295
01:12:20,025 --> 01:12:21,643
Jesus!

296
01:12:23,558 --> 01:12:26,444
God! I just grabbed him there.

297
01:12:30,658 --> 01:12:32,359
Slaves.

298
01:12:32,459 --> 01:12:35,159
- What?
- Slaves.

299
01:12:35,758 --> 01:12:38,160
They're using them for slaves.

300
01:12:39,259 --> 01:12:41,259
The dwarves.

301
01:12:41,658 --> 01:12:45,458
And they gotta crush 'em
'cause of the gravity...

302
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:48,244
and the heat.

303
01:12:51,758 --> 01:12:54,159
And this is the door to their planet.

304
01:12:55,158 --> 01:12:56,659
Yeah.

305
01:12:57,508 --> 01:12:59,893
And these guys are all ready to go.

306
01:13:04,191 --> 01:13:05,759
Yeah.

307
01:13:09,675 --> 01:13:12,575
- Okay, stay together.
- Wait a sec. I think I got a lighter.

308
01:13:12,675 --> 01:13:14,776
Quick, light it up.

309
01:13:20,575 --> 01:13:22,575
Over here. Follow me.

310
01:13:26,825 --> 01:13:29,227
Jody, where are ya?

311
01:13:30,825 --> 01:13:32,326
Mike!

312
01:13:35,276 --> 01:13:37,143
Ah, shit!

313
01:13:38,441 --> 01:13:40,209
Mike!

314
01:13:40,309 --> 01:13:42,310
Mike, where are ya?

315
01:13:43,858 --> 01:13:45,626
Mike!

316
01:15:41,441 --> 01:15:43,127
Jody!

317
01:15:44,425 --> 01:15:46,625
Jody, where are ya!

318
01:15:47,624 --> 01:15:50,773
Jody! Jody!

319
01:15:53,324 --> 01:15:54,676
Jody!

320
01:16:39,524 --> 01:16:41,691
Jody, where are ya?

321
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:54,628
Mike! Mike!

322
01:16:59,725 --> 01:17:03,210
Mike! Mike, come on. We gotta find Reggie.

323
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:37,726
Where's Reggie? We gotta find him.

324
01:17:45,491 --> 01:17:47,074
- It's Reggie!
- No!

325
01:17:47,174 --> 01:17:50,606
- Come on! We got to help him.
- No, you can't help him. He's dead.

326
01:18:09,658 --> 01:18:11,442
There's a...

327
01:18:12,441 --> 01:18:14,741
there's an old mine shaft

328
01:18:14,841 --> 01:18:18,525
way down by the...
by the end of Singer's Creek.

329
01:18:20,441 --> 01:18:23,226
A thousand feet straight down.

330
01:18:24,942 --> 01:18:27,925
We just gotta... we just gotta figure
a way to get him up there.

331
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:35,763
What are we gonna do without Reggie?

332
01:18:37,508 --> 01:18:39,909
Reggie's the last he'll ever get...

333
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:44,638
'cause we're gonna run
that tall bastard straight down to hell.

334
01:18:45,707 --> 01:18:48,929
Look, you go in and try to find more ammo.

335
01:18:49,029 --> 01:18:51,741
I'm gonna haul ass over there
and get rid of that warning barrier

336
01:18:51,841 --> 01:18:54,389
around the mine shaft and camouflage it.

337
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:59,894
Lock up the house good, man,
and stay in there. I'll be right back.

338
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

339
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

340
01:20:41,641 --> 01:20:43,326
Boy!

341
01:20:55,374 --> 01:20:58,057
<i>You play a good game, boy.</i>

342
01:20:58,157 --> 01:21:00,408
<i>But the game is finished.</i>

343
01:21:00,508 --> 01:21:03,025
<i>Now you die.</i>

344
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:09,958
Don't fear.

345
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:12,709
Don't fear.

346
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:45,325
Don't fear.

347
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

348
01:23:33,458 --> 01:23:35,743
I hear the sounds.

349
01:23:38,157 --> 01:23:40,759
I know those rocks aren't gonna hold him.

350
01:23:41,258 --> 01:23:43,059
Not for long.

351
01:23:44,658 --> 01:23:46,757
Hey, you had a dream.

352
01:23:46,857 --> 01:23:48,858
Just a nightmare.

353
01:23:49,258 --> 01:23:53,259
What do you expect? You've hardly
slept since the funeral last week.

354
01:23:53,858 --> 01:23:56,259
I know those rocks aren't gonna hold him.

355
01:23:57,458 --> 01:23:59,559
First he took Mom and Dad...

356
01:24:00,358 --> 01:24:02,359
then he took Jody.

357
01:24:03,358 --> 01:24:05,458
Now he's after me.

358
01:24:05,558 --> 01:24:09,214
Mike, that Tall Man of yours
did not take Jody away.

359
01:24:09,314 --> 01:24:11,593
Jody died in a car wreck.

360
01:24:39,275 --> 01:24:41,091
Mike.

361
01:24:41,191 --> 01:24:43,493
You had a bad dream.

362
01:24:44,692 --> 01:24:47,092
I know you're scared...

363
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:51,008
but you're not alone.

364
01:24:57,724 --> 01:24:59,759
I'll take care of you.

365
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:04,525
I know I can't ever take Jody's place...

366
01:25:05,224 --> 01:25:07,627
but I'm sure as hell gonna try.

367
01:25:12,425 --> 01:25:14,610
It seemed so real.

368
01:25:17,957 --> 01:25:22,007
You know, partner, what we need
is a change of scenery.

369
01:25:24,607 --> 01:25:27,205
Why don't you and me
hit the road for a couple of weeks?

370
01:25:28,658 --> 01:25:30,691
Where'll we go?

371
01:25:31,091 --> 01:25:34,975
Well, I don't know. I guess we can
figure that one out when we get there.

372
01:25:39,658 --> 01:25:40,937
Okay.

373
01:25:41,037 --> 01:25:43,975
Well, get on upstairs.
Get your gear together.

374
01:25:44,325 --> 01:25:47,125
'Cause we leave when the sun comes up.

375
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Boy!
