1
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,114
It's okay. Mommy's here, okay?

2
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,317
I need you to be a big boy, okay?

3
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:42,533
Get under the bed. Get under the bed.
Right now. Quick. Quick.

4
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,664
Please, leave us alone!

5
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,755
Where's Mom? Where's...

6
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,489
Go, Michael, go!

7
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,359
No!

8
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,743
Michael.

9
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,610
Michael, run!

10
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

11
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,269
You're going to run down the battery.

12
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,580
Like you could get
a signal around here anyway.

13
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:28,245
Luckily, people out here remember you can
have conversations without those things.

14
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,848
It's okay, buddy.

15
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,689
Be careful not to unbuckle his seatbelt.

16
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,056
I'm not.

17
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,162
We're here. How about that?

18
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,504
No going back now.

19
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,709
We couldn't afford it even if we wanted to.

20
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,581
I know it's a bit run-down,
but wait till you see the inside.

21
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,720
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Denise, check out the water pump.

22
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,519
You want to come see your new back yard?

23
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,050
Yeah? It's big.

24
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,757
- Still works.
- Yeah, I'm impressed.

25
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,658
I know you're worried.

26
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:02,538
But a couple of days and I'll have everything
here running like new. I promise.

27
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,473
Even that?

28
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,082
All right. Maybe a week.

29
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,311
Still think we can do this?

30
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,122
Climate's right. The soil reports are great.

31
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,790
Listen, I know I couldn't make this work
in the city.

32
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,658
But this is something I know.

33
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

34
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

35
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,220
Jess.

36
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,319
Jess, come help with these bags.

37
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,065
What do you think of the house?

38
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,663
Neat.

39
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,271
Help us unload.

40
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,273
If we want anything to sleep on tonight,
we got to get moving.

41
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,435
Okay.

42
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,239
Neat.

43
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

44
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,913
I think she's going to be okay.

45
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,987
Well, at least she's talking to us.
I guess that's a start.

46
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,820
Yeah.

47
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,964
I love it out here, you know.

48
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,447
- Hey.
- Hey.

49
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,073
How's it going?

50
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,621
It's so quiet out here.

51
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,157
Yeah. It takes some getting used to, huh?

52
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:57,237
You know, bringing you out here
wasn't a punishment, Jessica.

53
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,709
It's an adjustment for everybody.

54
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,307
And the only way
we're going to make this work

55
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,476
is if we give it a chance.

56
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,049
"I'll take that as a good point, Dad.

57
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,650
"You're right. You're always right."

58
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,435
Good night.

59
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,765
Get some sleep.

60
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,921
Don't give up, honey!

61
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,186
Don't worry. I'll get it.

62
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:53,859
Come on.

63
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,028
Come on.

64
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,762
Come on.

65
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,362
Come on. That's right. Come on.

66
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,800
He did it! High-five. High-five.

67
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,508
He did it!

68
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

69
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,717
Roy Solomon?

70
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,749
Colby Price. Belton Savings.

71
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,348
Oh, hey. Good to meet you.

72
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,727
So you said
your father grew sunflowers, too.

73
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,890
Yeah, over in Turek County.

74
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,299
I grew up not too far from here.

75
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,530
Right.

76
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,132
Look, I know you're all moved in,

77
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:13,702
but an opportunity came up at the bank
that I thought you might be interested in.

78
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,771
This place sat gathering dust for years
until you came along and bought it,

79
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,317
and now, as it happens,

80
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,718
another party's expressed interest
in the farm.

81
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,415
The good news is,
they're willing to pay what you paid

82
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,323
and put another 15% on top of that.

83
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,531
We just got here.

84
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,930
And frankly,

85
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:39,035
my family's looking for a little stability
right now.

86
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,102
Well, this will give you the details.

87
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,739
Give me a call if you want to discuss it.

88
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,413
Thanks, I will.

89
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hey, Benny.
I'm coming.

90
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:15,937
You ready?

91
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,813
Oh, great.

92
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,360
Ben?

93
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,210
Ben?

94
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,859
Hey, sport.

95
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,959
I thought you were asleep.

96
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,069
How'd you get out of bed, sport?

97
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,599
I thought you were...

98
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,782
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

99
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,410
Okay.

100
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,957
All right, Ben.
Now you try to get some sleep now, okay?

101
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,292
Lay down. Go to sleep. Good boy.

102
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,591
Daddy loves you.

103
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,650
What?

104
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,677
What are you doing?

105
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,715
- Going to town.
- I don't think so, Jess.

106
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,248
Give me the keys.

107
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,654
I just had them, like, two seconds ago.

108
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,857
Thanks, Jess. You ready to go?

109
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,922
Jess?

110
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,930
What's up with that?

111
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,070
It was me, not her.

112
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,538
I thought she was taking the car.

113
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,540
Don't beat yourself up over it.

114
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:45,374
By the way, your son managed to climb
out of his crib last night.

115
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,815
That's new.

116
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,611
Yeah.

117
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,752
So are the things I'm gonna do to you

118
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,855
when I come in from the fields tonight.

119
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,561
- New things, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

120
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,023
I've been reading the farmer-sutra.

121
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,367
See you.

122
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:30,793
- There you go. You have a good day now.
- Thanks, Ed.

123
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,853
Well, you're the new folks in town, right?

124
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,796
Yeah, Roy Solomon.

125
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,266
- So what do you plant?
- Sunflowers.

126
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,032
All right. Let me help you get started.

127
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,638
Hey, mind if I go look around?

128
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,742
Okay.

129
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,340
Hey, don't go too far.

130
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,629
Hey, buddy.

131
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,162
Hey, what're you looking at?

132
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,939
You didn't get to finish your cereal.

133
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:05,247
And Daddy said you got out of the crib
last night all by yourself.

134
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,083
Did you do that all by yourself?

135
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,490
Nice!

136
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,355
Pass it up.

137
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:17,784
Got it.

138
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,885
You're all over him.

139
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,855
- Get up! Get up!
- Take it!

140
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,367
- Come on, Bobby. What was that?
- Come on.

141
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,236
Little help?

142
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,134
Thanks.

143
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,839
- It's all in the wrists.
- Right.

144
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,384
I'm Bobby.

145
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,680
Jess.

146
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,416
Welcome to North Dakota, Jess.
You're from Chicago, right?

147
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,753
Yeah. How'd you know that?

148
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:53,965
Small town. Everybody knows everything.
You might want to remember that.

149
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,335
So what do you guys do for fun out here?

150
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,568
You're looking at it.

151
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,068
Sweet.

152
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,968
Half now and half at harvest.
That's the best I can do.

153
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,183
I appreciate it.

154
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:18,814
And if you're looking for labor,
it's gotten cheap with all the unemployment.

155
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:24,426
I can't afford much now,
but I'll keep it in mind. Thanks, Ed.

156
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,366
You're kicking my ass.

157
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,565
Yeah, it's all in the wrists.

158
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,470
Come on, you played in Chicago, right?

159
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,338
Well, I used to. I played in junior high.

160
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,843
Yeah? What happened?

161
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:45,178
I don't know.
I guess I just got into other things.

162
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,782
Well, the girls' team here is for shit.

163
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,258
Yeah, boys' is too, if you're on it.

164
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,831
Nice one, bro.

165
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:15,374
Hey, you know, if you ever get bored
of doing nothing out at the farm,

166
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:21,248
I could always swing by and pick you up,

167
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:25,619
and we could go do nothing
someplace else.

168
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,383
Yeah, maybe.

169
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,460
Hey, I got to go.

170
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,203
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

171
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,869
Nice to meet you.

172
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,316
Hey, who was that kid?

173
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,275
Just some guy.

174
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,849
From around here?

175
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,685
No. He commutes to shoot hoops.

176
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,219
You get his number?

177
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,355
Dad.

178
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,728
If you want to go back,
if you're too embarrassed,

179
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,233
- I'll get his number for you.
- Dad.

180
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:22,673
You know, I think you and your mom would
have a lot to talk about if you give it a try.

181
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,186
We're all in this together, Jess.

182
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,266
So I'll go see if Mom needs anything.

183
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,572
Okay. Sure.

184
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,814
How was town?

185
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,044
Small.

186
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:06,222
Hey, Jess, I'm really sorry about earlier.

187
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,458
It's okay.

188
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:15,128
Need me to help you with anything?

189
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,101
I'd love it if you could carry down
some of those boxes in the hallway.

190
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,364
Sure. Where do you want them?

191
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,400
Just put them in the cellar.

192
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,239
Thanks.

193
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,079
Oh, God. You got to stop that.

194
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,284
Sorry if I surprised you.

195
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,849
What do you want?

196
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,361
I wondered if you'd had a chance to look
at that purchase offer yet.

197
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,024
We're gonna make a go of it.

198
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,589
We're staying.

199
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:53,460
Now, if you don't mind, I've got work to do.

200
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,170
Of course.

201
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,802
Always lots of work to do around a farm.

202
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,107
Bye now.

203
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,281
Damn it!

204
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,617
Get out of here!

205
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:26,555
Shit.

206
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

207
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,352
Oh, my God.

208
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,583
About the only thing that keeps them away.

209
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,483
They always like that?

210
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,147
No. Hell, they just want your seeds.

211
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,883
- Roy Solomon.
- John Burwell.

212
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:11,087
Good to meet you.
Lucky you came by when you did.

213
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:14,290
- You live around here?
- No, I was just heading into town.

214
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,265
Got to go where the work is.

215
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,063
What do you do?

216
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,832
A little bit of everything. Why, you...

217
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,368
You need some help around here?

218
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,435
What was that noise? What's going on?

219
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,913
Everything's all right.

220
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:34,418
This is John Burwell,
part-time crow exterminator.

221
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,579
The crows were going nuts out here.
If John hadn't come along when he did,

222
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,623
I might have gotten pecked to death.

223
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,750
Well, it's a good thing he did then.

224
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:46,763
I could sure use somebody to help me in the
fields, but I really can't pay you till harvest.

225
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:51,268
We could provide meals and put you up
in the workers' quarters till then.

226
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,935
Sunflowers, huh?

227
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,364
All you can eat.

228
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,003
That sounds good to me.

229
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,277
Well, I was making some lunch.
Would you like to join us?

230
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,680
- Sure. Sounds good.
- Okay.

231
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,319
Do you mind keeping that outside?

232
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,858
Sorry.

233
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,629
Got any family out here, John?

234
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,233
No, ma'am. Just me.

235
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,204
Think it's going to be a good harvest?

236
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,943
Well, it's been a while since
that land's been planted, so, yeah.

237
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,581
That's what I like to hear.

238
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,848
Cheers.

239
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,619
Hey, Jess.
Do you mind helping me with these?

240
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,787
Yeah.

241
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,358
Thanks.

242
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,460
You want this?

243
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,065
He won't stop.

244
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,373
But it must mean he likes you.

245
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,975
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

246
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,933
What are you looking for?

247
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,229
Nothing.

248
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:06,895
Roy?

249
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,372
What's wrong?

250
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,866
Oh, my God!

251
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,535
Are you okay?

252
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,806
- What happened?
- It's no big deal.

253
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,075
I cut my hand on the tractor.

254
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,581
Oh, honey, you're gonna need stitches.

255
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,050
No, I just need a bandage.

256
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,610
No, we got to get you to the hospital.

257
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,485
Well, I can take him.

258
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,886
Not with a suspended license, you can't.

259
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,518
All right. I'm going to get Ben's bag.
Jess, you get in the car.

260
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,723
Ben can stay here with Jess.

261
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,629
Roy, I don't think it's a good idea.

262
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:39,261
Just grab the keys and let's go.
Jess and Ben will be fine.

263
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,170
John's right outside if they need anything.

264
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,654
Holy shit.

265
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,695
Your dad gonna be all right?

266
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,358
Yeah. He probably just needs some stitches.

267
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:14,200
Hey, what you got there? Farmer?

268
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,907
You gonna be a farmer when you grow up,
like your daddy, huh?

269
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:22,104
- Let me know if you need anything, okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

270
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,175
What's up with the crows?

271
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,293
All right, Ben. Tonight we have

272
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,234
filet mignon, veal parmesan,

273
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:50,172
baked Alaska, chicken cacciatore,

274
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,436
and mac and cheese.

275
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,717
Stay here, Ben, okay?

276
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,619
Hey.

277
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,489
John.

278
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,367
Is that you?

279
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hey, who is...

280
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,778
911. What's your emergency?

281
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,909
I think there's something in my house!

282
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,954
I need you to get everybody
out of the house as quickly as possible.

283
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:14,321
We'll send a car immediately.
Ma'am, are you alone?

284
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,984
No, I'm with... I'm with...

285
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,118
Ben!

286
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:30,431
Ben!

287
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,449
Ben?

288
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Ben, what are you...

289
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,165
Ben!

290
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

291
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,323
Let me go!

292
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

293
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,805
What's wrong?

294
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:48,208
Help us! Take him. Take him.

295
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,912
What's the matter?

296
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What is it? Jess. What's the matter?

297
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,566
Oh, Roy, I hope they're okay.

298
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:19,273
- What happened?
- Everything's all right, ma'am.

299
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,318
Oh, God.

300
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,927
I already checked all the rooms.
There's nobody here.

301
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,225
But she described a lot of damage.

302
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:39,299
As of now, we're going to classify this
as a false alarm, not a deliberate hoax.

303
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,771
Thank you.

304
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,035
What did John say?

305
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,947
Well, he said it was easy to understand
someone getting scared

306
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,417
their first night alone out here.

307
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,221
But that he didn't see anything unusual
in the house.

308
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:04,819
Mom, please believe me.
I'm not making this up. I'm telling the truth.

309
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,362
Jess, please.

310
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,296
Just stop.

311
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:15,630
Dad...

312
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,076
Dad, I'm really scared.
Can we just go home?

313
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:25,279
Jessica, this is home.

314
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,612
You need to get used to that.

315
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,086
But I thought we agreed that
you were going to try.

316
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,093
What happened to that?

317
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,723
Hi. Shut the door.

318
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,163
Maybe we shouldn't have
left Ben alone with her.

319
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:26,934
Did you see her face?
She seemed so scared.

320
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:32,542
I'm really worried about her.

321
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,915
She's just having a hard time adjusting,
that's all.

322
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,948
Being out here will be great for her.

323
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,192
I don't know.

324
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:48,295
- Maybe we're in over our heads here, Roy.
- We'll get through this.

325
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,765
Just give her some time. She'll be fine.

326
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,704
You saw it too, didn't you?

327
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,480
Come on. I know you did. You had to have.

328
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,513
Just tell me.

329
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:19,094
I wish you could just tell them
what you saw.

330
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,528
Come on, Ben.
When are you going to start talking?

331
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,169
I promise I'll never let anything
happen to you.

332
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,144
I promise.

333
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,205
You heard that, too, didn't you?

334
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,235
Can you see them?

335
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,817
Where are they, Ben?

336
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

337
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,347
Son of a bitch!

338
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,457
Hey, you didn't hear that.

339
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,263
- Dad said you needed this.
- Yeah, thanks.

340
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:32,072
Why did you tell my parents
you didn't see anything last night?

341
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,643
Well, because I didn't.

342
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,776
I mean, look, I know you were scared.

343
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:46,146
And I know that people,
even your parents, sometimes,

344
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:49,386
- they don't know how to listen.
- Especially my parents.

345
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:53,862
They got pressures
that you can't even begin to understand.

346
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,664
You sure you saw something up there?

347
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,934
I saw it. It was real.

348
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:08,105
Maybe you've just got a lot on your mind.

349
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,989
Hey, Jess.

350
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,290
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

351
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,898
You don't look so good. What's up?

352
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:34,493
Did you know the family
that used to live in my house?

353
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,971
Not really. It was the Rollins that lived there.

354
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,234
What happened to them?

355
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,641
They just up and left
about five, six years ago.

356
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:45,409
There were some bad harvests.
Lot of people didn't make it.

357
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,811
Hey...

358
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:55,551
Did you ever hear of anything
about my house being, like, haunted?

359
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,428
Seriously.

360
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:05,092
Just, like, stupid stories.
It's been abandoned for a long time. So...

361
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,796
- What kind of stories?
- Nothing really.

362
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:13,501
When we were kids, we used to dare
each other to go down into the cellar.

363
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,909
Why? Did you ever see anything?

364
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,713
No. Not me.

365
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,920
I never went down there.

366
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

367
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

368
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

369
00:53:28,544 --> 00:53:30,171
What's happening to me?

370
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Are you okay?
I saw something again today.

371
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:05,169
It's a girl. She was in the cellar.
Something...

372
00:54:07,016 --> 00:54:09,211
Something happened to her.

373
00:54:12,622 --> 00:54:15,455
She was trying to get away from something.

374
00:54:16,092 --> 00:54:18,526
- Get away from what?
- I don't know.

375
00:54:19,195 --> 00:54:20,822
But she was...

376
00:54:20,897 --> 00:54:24,230
She looked just scared to death.

377
00:54:31,407 --> 00:54:33,272
Have you told your folks about this?

378
00:54:33,342 --> 00:54:35,776
You know my parents already think I'm nuts.

379
00:54:38,915 --> 00:54:40,883
Do you think it's crazy?

380
00:54:42,552 --> 00:54:44,213
People's spirits

381
00:54:45,388 --> 00:54:47,879
hanging around after they're dead?

382
00:54:49,926 --> 00:54:51,188
No.

383
00:54:52,295 --> 00:54:55,958
There's something about the land out here.

384
00:54:56,032 --> 00:54:59,798
It gets ahold of people.
It doesn't want to let them go.

385
00:55:08,077 --> 00:55:11,069
What about you?
Don't you get lonely out here?

386
00:55:12,214 --> 00:55:14,808
Don't you miss having a family of your own?

387
00:55:14,884 --> 00:55:17,580
Nah, you guys keep me plenty busy.

388
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:28,789
Thank you. For listening.

389
00:55:31,133 --> 00:55:32,361
Anytime.

390
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:53,418
- Almost ready.
- Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

391
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,819
I really like being here, Roy.

392
00:55:59,895 --> 00:56:03,092
You guys make me feel like family.
I'm grateful.

393
00:56:03,165 --> 00:56:05,133
Lucky to have you, John.

394
00:56:05,868 --> 00:56:10,202
Let's see how good the harvest is,
and maybe I can afford to keep you on.

395
00:56:10,272 --> 00:56:13,799
Don't worry about me.
You just take care of your family.

396
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

397
00:57:41,997 --> 00:57:43,692
Help me.

398
00:58:06,322 --> 00:58:07,482
Hello?

399
00:58:19,535 --> 00:58:21,526
What do you want from me?

400
00:59:16,158 --> 00:59:17,216
Hey.

401
00:59:22,965 --> 00:59:24,227
You okay?

402
00:59:29,972 --> 00:59:31,564
Can you hear me?

403
00:59:42,585 --> 00:59:44,052
What's wrong?

404
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

405
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,648
Is she okay?

406
01:00:19,722 --> 01:00:22,486
The lacerations are superficial.
So she'll be just fine.

407
01:00:22,558 --> 01:00:24,150
Oh, thank God.

408
01:00:25,094 --> 01:00:26,721
Is there any reason...

409
01:00:26,795 --> 01:00:29,856
Has there been any trouble
in the family recently

410
01:00:29,932 --> 01:00:33,766
that would make her want to hurt
or draw attention to herself?

411
01:00:40,075 --> 01:00:42,407
We just moved here from Chicago.

412
01:00:43,279 --> 01:00:45,804
And back there,

413
01:00:45,881 --> 01:00:49,578
Jess got into some trouble.

414
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,950
She's kind of struggled a bit.

415
01:00:54,323 --> 01:00:58,521
We've been dealing with
a lot of emotional issues.

416
01:01:12,141 --> 01:01:14,132
Jessica? Your mom's here.

417
01:01:15,411 --> 01:01:16,469
Hey.

418
01:01:28,824 --> 01:01:31,452
Dad, we need to leave the house now,

419
01:01:31,527 --> 01:01:33,722
before anything else happens.

420
01:01:35,764 --> 01:01:36,822
Dad.

421
01:01:38,634 --> 01:01:40,192
Dad, I'm really scared.

422
01:01:40,269 --> 01:01:44,000
Have you forgotten how hard it was
the last couple of years?

423
01:01:44,673 --> 01:01:47,506
Me out of work, Ben's hospital bills.

424
01:01:47,576 --> 01:01:50,568
We went through every dime
your mother and I managed to save.

425
01:01:50,646 --> 01:01:55,140
Twenty years.
Twenty years of savings gone in two years.

426
01:01:57,286 --> 01:02:01,017
We have everything
riding on this harvest, Jess. Everything.

427
01:02:02,658 --> 01:02:05,388
We're only a couple of days away. Please.

428
01:02:09,598 --> 01:02:12,294
- Mom, these things attacked me.
- Enough!

429
01:02:20,976 --> 01:02:25,242
God. The doctor said
your cuts look self-inflicted.

430
01:02:25,314 --> 01:02:28,010
That's what he said. That you did this!

431
01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:33,554
You actually think that I would do this
to myself?

432
01:02:36,692 --> 01:02:38,683
Why won't you believe me?

433
01:02:39,428 --> 01:02:41,055
How can we, Jess?

434
01:02:43,899 --> 01:02:45,127
Tell me!

435
01:02:46,902 --> 01:02:49,598
I mean,
we thought you put this all behind you.

436
01:02:58,514 --> 01:03:01,244
Why do you keep
blaming everything on me?

437
01:03:02,151 --> 01:03:04,051
You never listen to me.

438
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:09,416
And what? We're supposed to pretend like
we're some big happy family again?

439
01:03:09,858 --> 01:03:11,450
I can't do that.

440
01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:15,421
Jess!

441
01:03:18,867 --> 01:03:20,232
Let her go.

442
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:57,002
Maybe coming here was a mistake.

443
01:03:57,806 --> 01:03:59,899
Don't second-guess yourself, Roy.

444
01:03:59,975 --> 01:04:03,638
Why not? Everybody else around here does.

445
01:04:03,712 --> 01:04:05,737
Don't attack me over this.

446
01:04:07,282 --> 01:04:09,011
I should have sold.

447
01:04:11,353 --> 01:04:13,719
- Damn it.
- What?

448
01:04:20,496 --> 01:04:24,330
Right after we got here,
there was another offer on the place.

449
01:04:26,435 --> 01:04:29,700
We would have made our money back,
plus another 15% .

450
01:04:36,678 --> 01:04:39,545
And you didn't even mention this to me?

451
01:04:39,615 --> 01:04:43,142
How could I?
You would have taken the offer on the spot.

452
01:04:43,952 --> 01:04:47,115
So you make this decision
without even telling me?

453
01:04:47,189 --> 01:04:50,989
I held this family together for two years
while you were looking for a job.

454
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:55,996
And then I come all the way out here
when you decided this was the answer.

455
01:04:56,064 --> 01:04:59,898
And now we had another option
and you didn't even tell me about it?

456
01:04:59,968 --> 01:05:02,198
You held this family together?

457
01:05:03,005 --> 01:05:06,532
Is that why you and Jess can't even be in
the same room for more than five minutes?

458
01:05:06,608 --> 01:05:08,735
No wonder the girl's a mess.

459
01:05:12,548 --> 01:05:15,984
Damn, Denise. Denise, I'm sorry.

460
01:05:19,154 --> 01:05:20,382
Damn it.

461
01:05:38,273 --> 01:05:39,365
Damn.

462
01:05:44,646 --> 01:05:46,136
Everything okay, Roy?

463
01:05:46,215 --> 01:05:49,673
No matter what I do,
I can't keep this family together.

464
01:06:10,405 --> 01:06:12,134
Hey. You all right?

465
01:06:13,242 --> 01:06:14,971
Do you want a ride?

466
01:06:18,447 --> 01:06:20,415
So where are we going?

467
01:06:20,482 --> 01:06:22,643
Feed store.

468
01:06:22,718 --> 01:06:23,810
Why?

469
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:30,124
Bobby, I'm gonna tell you something.

470
01:06:30,192 --> 01:06:34,128
And I need you to believe me,
because nobody else does.

471
01:06:34,196 --> 01:06:35,254
Okay.

472
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:37,628
I don't think the Rollins just up and left.

473
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:40,099
What are you talking about, Jess?

474
01:06:40,535 --> 01:06:42,628
I think something really terrible
happened to them.

475
01:06:42,704 --> 01:06:45,298
I think they're dead. I've seen them.

476
01:06:46,608 --> 01:06:48,337
You've seen ghosts?

477
01:06:55,484 --> 01:06:59,420
- Have you talked to your parents?
- I've tried but they won't listen to me.

478
01:06:59,488 --> 01:07:00,546
Why?

479
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:04,991
Back in Chicago, I messed up.

480
01:07:09,765 --> 01:07:14,327
Like, six months ago, my mom was picking
up my dad from the airport.

481
01:07:14,403 --> 01:07:18,237
And his flight was late,
so she called to see if I could

482
01:07:18,307 --> 01:07:22,004
pick up my little brother
from the babysitter's house.

483
01:07:22,077 --> 01:07:27,105
And I should have told her
that I'd been drinking with my friends but...

484
01:07:27,182 --> 01:07:29,810
I mean, it wasn't like
I was wasted or anything,

485
01:07:29,885 --> 01:07:31,284
and I thought I was okay to drive.

486
01:07:31,353 --> 01:07:36,916
But we got in a wreck,
and Ben had to go to the hospital.

487
01:07:38,627 --> 01:07:40,959
And he hasn't talked since then.

488
01:07:43,498 --> 01:07:47,366
I mean, they just haven't let it go yet.

489
01:07:50,105 --> 01:07:52,505
Everybody makes mistakes, Jess.

490
01:07:58,747 --> 01:07:59,839
Yeah.

491
01:08:00,349 --> 01:08:02,647
Your sister's going to be okay.

492
01:08:03,185 --> 01:08:04,652
Right, Benny?

493
01:08:06,755 --> 01:08:08,484
Say, "Right, Mama."

494
01:08:21,136 --> 01:08:23,366
What are you pointing at, Ben?

495
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,608
What do you see?

496
01:08:29,277 --> 01:08:31,177
What does it look like?

497
01:09:05,447 --> 01:09:06,937
What the hell?

498
01:09:52,494 --> 01:09:55,395
Okay, honey.
Lie down for your nap, sweetie.

499
01:09:56,498 --> 01:09:58,659
You okay? All right.

500
01:11:00,328 --> 01:11:03,627
The woman in this watch,
I remember seeing her here.

501
01:11:06,401 --> 01:11:07,561
There!

502
01:11:10,338 --> 01:11:11,703
That's her.

503
01:11:16,878 --> 01:11:18,140
Oh, my God.

504
01:11:18,213 --> 01:11:20,443
- What is it?
- I got to get home.

505
01:11:24,686 --> 01:11:27,780
Ben, honey. We got to get out of here.

506
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Honey, come on.

507
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Mama will be right there.
Mama will be right there.
All right. Stay right there. All right, okay.
Mama will be right there.
You stay right there.

508
01:12:27,248 --> 01:12:28,909
Oh, my God, John.

509
01:12:29,784 --> 01:12:31,547
Where are you going?

510
01:12:33,388 --> 01:12:35,515
Where are you going, Mary?

511
01:12:37,392 --> 01:12:38,484
What?

512
01:12:41,329 --> 01:12:42,796
What is this?

513
01:12:45,133 --> 01:12:46,862
Are you leaving me?

514
01:12:47,702 --> 01:12:49,932
- I don't...
- Shut up!

515
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:51,971
No, don't...

516
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:56,208
I've been working my ass off every day.

517
01:12:56,778 --> 01:12:59,508
- It's never good enough for you, is it?
- Oh, God.

518
01:13:01,316 --> 01:13:05,150
Did you really think
that I could ever let you leave me?

519
01:13:13,928 --> 01:13:15,190
Michael.

520
01:13:24,172 --> 01:13:26,800
Open this door! Open this door, Mary!

521
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:39,377
Mom?

522
01:13:43,358 --> 01:13:44,416
Dad?

523
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Mom?

524
01:14:08,983 --> 01:14:10,041
Mom?

525
01:14:11,586 --> 01:14:12,644
Ben?

526
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

527
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

528
01:14:49,457 --> 01:14:50,481
Go!

529
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:07,968
Bobby, wait!

530
01:15:08,042 --> 01:15:09,304
- What?
- My brother.

531
01:15:09,377 --> 01:15:12,744
- He's not here. Let's go.
- Bobby, watch out!

532
01:15:22,357 --> 01:15:24,848
Open the door!

533
01:15:37,338 --> 01:15:38,396
Mom?

534
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:56,948
Mom.

535
01:15:57,358 --> 01:15:58,620
Oh, Jess.

536
01:16:00,061 --> 01:16:02,291
I know what you were seeing.

537
01:16:02,363 --> 01:16:05,890
I've seen it, too.
I'm so sorry I didn't trust you.

538
01:16:13,308 --> 01:16:15,333
Mom, I've got to find a way out of here.

539
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:16,809
- Okay?
- Okay.

540
01:16:20,448 --> 01:16:25,044
Mary. Do you think
I would let you walk out on this family?

541
01:16:28,923 --> 01:16:30,823
Open the door, Lindsay.

542
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Open the door!

543
01:17:13,434 --> 01:17:15,299
You're not leaving me.

544
01:18:23,638 --> 01:18:26,436
Be quiet, sweetheart. Be quiet.

545
01:18:38,386 --> 01:18:40,650
Bobby? Bobby!

546
01:18:46,728 --> 01:18:49,322
Where are they, Bobby? Where are they?

547
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Denise?
- Dad?
- Jess.

548
01:19:09,584 --> 01:19:10,676
Dad!

549
01:19:14,088 --> 01:19:16,522
You've been a bad girl, Lindsay.

550
01:19:23,064 --> 01:19:25,225
No! Leave her alone!

551
01:19:29,904 --> 01:19:31,394
Come here!

552
01:19:33,474 --> 01:19:37,035
Why are you always trying to run away
from me, Lindsay?

553
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:41,307
What's the matter with you?

554
01:19:42,183 --> 01:19:44,515
Don't you like your family?

555
01:19:48,189 --> 01:19:51,124
My family is going to stick together!

556
01:19:59,534 --> 01:20:01,661
We're not your family!

557
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Mom?

558
01:21:18,446 --> 01:21:19,504
Dad!

559
01:21:24,285 --> 01:21:25,513
I got you.

560
01:21:41,802 --> 01:21:43,030
Hold on!

561
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:33,082
Hey, honey, it's me.

562
01:22:34,989 --> 01:22:37,082
It's gonna be all right.

563
01:22:38,759 --> 01:22:41,819
Mrs. Solomon,
I have just a few more questions.

564
01:22:57,612 --> 01:22:59,409
You're gonna be okay.

565
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:24,731
Excuse us, please.

566
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:26,537
Let's get him in.

567
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:58,065
Maybe now they can rest, Ben.

568
01:24:07,682 --> 01:24:09,650
- Hey.
- Hey.

569
01:24:09,717 --> 01:24:12,550
- You thirsty?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

570
01:24:18,659 --> 01:24:20,456
So, how's it going?

571
01:24:21,829 --> 01:24:23,319
Getting there.

572
01:24:25,032 --> 01:24:27,626
What's up there, dude? What's in the sky?

573
01:24:27,702 --> 01:24:30,432
- That. Birdie.
- What's that?

574
01:24:32,373 --> 01:24:36,639
- Is that a cloud?
- Crow. That's a crow.

575
01:24:41,916 --> 01:24:43,440
How about that?
