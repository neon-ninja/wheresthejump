00:00:07,392 --> 00:00:12,705
THE PERFUME
OF THE LADY IN BLACK

2
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:34,868
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

3
00:03:58,432 --> 00:04:00,627
Hi, is everything okay?

4
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:03,143
Yes, pretty good.

5
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:06,304
I just have to bring it up
to temperature.

6
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:13,872
- Morning.
- Morning, Miss Hacherman.

7
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:17,581
- How's it going?
- You were right.

8
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:20,665
- This compound is positive.
- That's fine.

9
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:23,301
- It means we're almost ready.
- Yes.

10
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:25,748
Good.
Well then...

11
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:29,508
I'm going to see
how Elisabeth is doing.

12
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,907
How's it going?
Are you done yet?

13
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:41,710
It wasn't as easy as I thought.

14
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:44,989
Series K didn't work out too well
and I had to do it over.

15
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:47,905
This material has to be in Berlin!

16
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:51,030
It's not my fault,
I've been working all night.

17
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:54,902
I want it ready by tonight.

18
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:57,950
- Call me if you need anything.
- All right.

19
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:00,706
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

20
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:17,183
- Good morning.
- Hi.

21
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:18,911
Good morning, Mrs Lovati.

22
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,030
Miss Hacherman,
I figured you weren't coming anymore.

23
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:25,708
Isn't it beautiful?
I hate it here when it rains.

24
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:27,863
It's so sad.

25
00:05:28,592 --> 00:05:30,184
You're right, it's a lovely day.

26
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:32,866
- Take the hose if you need it.
- All right.

27
00:06:59,832 --> 00:07:01,788
- I'm sorry...
- Mr Rossetti!

28
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:04,262
I realized I was out of tea.

29
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:08,425
And our fellow tenants
are all away on vacation.

30
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:11,584
Could you help out
an old widower?

31
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,062
- Coffee is like poison to me!
- Of course.

32
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:15,904
I'll be right back.

33
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:19,189
Two or three spoonfuls
should be enough.

34
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:36,303
I hope this is enough.

35
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:38,861
Mozart...
What a genius!

36
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:42,422
- It reminds me...
- I don't mean to be rude...

37
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:45,106
...but I have to go out
and I'm running late.

38
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:48,264
- Maybe some other time.
- Well, thanks again.

39
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:51,185
Sorry to have troubled you.
If you need anything...

40
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:53,787
Thanks.
Goodbye.

41
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:58,031
We've changed too.

42
00:07:58,031 --> 00:07:58,431
We've changed too.

43
00:07:58,672 --> 00:08:01,789
We used to eat our enemies,
now we study engineering.

44
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:05,991
Unfortunately, it's slow progress.
There's a lot of prejudice.

45
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:10,669
We have no schools
and the witchdoctor's word rules.

46
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:13,745
The witchdoctor is Africa.

47
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:18,624
And you must understand Africa

48
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:20,351
in order to judge it.

49
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:26,108
Andy, you've forgotten
Roberto works often in Africa.

50
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:29,185
I know, Elise.
But he's still a white man.

51
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:32,947
I remember
an English geologist

52
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:34,625
in Cameroon with me.

53
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:39,791
He got the idea of making enemies
with the local witchdoctor.

54
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:44,344
I heard he was found dead
in his tent after much suffering.

55
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:47,231
The autopsy revealed

56
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:50,111
short cat whiskers,
like little needles,

57
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:52,946
embedded in his stomach wall.

58
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:55,706
He had evidently ingested them

59
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,863
but no one knows how.

60
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:02,344
That's a rather uneventful example
of black magic.

61
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:05,550
A university professor like you
can't believe such things.

62
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:09,181
In every corner of Africa,

63
00:09:10,752 --> 00:09:15,303
be it jungle,
savannahs, village,

64
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:20,262
river or even in
the skyscrapers of our modern cities,

65
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:25,788
a certain fear rides the hot winds.

66
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,820
An ancient fear with many names.

67
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:32,030
Black magic.

68
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:34,144
Witchcraft.

69
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:36,826
Superstitions, rites.

70
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:40,862
Mysterious deaths.

71
00:09:41,752 --> 00:09:44,141
- Human sacrifice.
- Not just in Africa.

72
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:46,860
In Europe too.

73
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:49,626
It's less known,
but it does go on.

74
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:51,749
But those people aren't normal.

75
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:56,588
In our country,
there are still cults

76
00:09:56,832 --> 00:10:00,666
who chose victims
without them even knowing it.

77
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:04,746
By means of potions
or evil rites,

78
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:07,825
they are driven mad then killed.

79
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:12,350
It is a challenge
thrown in the face of evil.

80
00:10:12,832 --> 00:10:17,223
The victim suffers a horrible death
by an ancient sacrifice.

81
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:25,942
But such practices require
time and patience.

82
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:31,584
They are like a test
of man's mental strength

83
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,663
over his weaknesses.

84
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:45,189
Did I frighten you?
I was only joking.

85
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,304
You mustn't believe a word of it.

86
00:10:47,552 --> 00:10:49,907
We no longer do such things.

87
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

88
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:31,229
- What time is it?
- 1:30 AM.

89
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:33,508
1:30?

90
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:37,142
That's funny,
I thought it was later.

91
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:39,189
Do you mind if I don't come up?

92
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,310
We have to get up early tomorrow.

93
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:45,350
Tomorrow's Monday.
You know I can't come.

94
00:11:45,592 --> 00:11:47,548
For Christ's sake,
it's always the same story.

95
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:51,307
We've known each other four months
and you haven't missed a day of work.

96
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:54,350
All you think about
is that damn lab!

97
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:58,062
It's the third time
Andy's asked us to play tennis.

98
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:00,268
You don't want to offend him,
do you?

99
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:06,185
I just don't understand you.

100
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:09,344
It's like you're excluding me
from your life.

101
00:12:09,592 --> 00:12:11,310
You know that's not true.

102
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:14,749
I just want to check on
the material going to Berlin.

103
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:18,064
To hell with the material!
You're obsessed.

104
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:20,701
It's not like you'll win
the Nobel Prize or anything.

105
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:24,667
You're so upset
over a silly tennis match.

106
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:28,029
You're right.
Do as you please.

107
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:31,311
I'll call you when I have time,
goodnight.

108
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:22,626
Miss!

109
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:25,591
Miss!
Wake up, it's late.

110
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:30,864
Miss!

111
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:36,465
Carlotta!

112
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:39,910
- Is it already time to go to work?
- No, it's much later.

113
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,189
- It's a quarter past three.
- That can't be!

114
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:46,663
It's a quarter past three.
You've had quite a sleep!

115
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:53,267
- I didn't even undress.
- It happens when you stay out late.

116
00:13:58,392 --> 00:14:00,860
Why didn't your brother wake me?

117
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:02,704
We tried.

118
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:07,025
Luigi rang over and over
and we thought you were out.

119
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:10,230
Then Francesca told me
you were still in.

120
00:14:10,472 --> 00:14:14,670
- I brought the newspaper.
- Thank you, you can go now.

121
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:22,788
Don't walk around barefoot,
you might cut yourself.

122
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:25,626
- The photograph fell and broke.
- I know.

123
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:27,669
I broke it.

124
00:14:37,112 --> 00:14:40,070
<i>The time is 3.31 pm.</i>

125
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:49,545
<i>"Music For You" continues.</i>

126
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:13,981
You must be a witch, Francesca.
How did you know we had an argument?

127
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:16,700
I saw it from my window.

128
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:20,822
It's never happened to me,
I fell asleep like that.

129
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:23,586
Carlotta woke me up an hour ago.

130
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:27,347
You work too hard,
you should have more fun with Roberto.

131
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:29,901
You should make up.
I'll take care of it.

132
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:32,666
- Doesn't he collect butterflies?
- Yes, why?

133
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:35,142
I have an idea.
Come with me.

134
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,223
Gorgeous creatures!

135
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:45,263
That's nice.

136
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:49,503
Is anybody here?

137
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,905
- Is anybody here?
- I've never noticed this store.

138
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:58,541
Sorry, I couldn't find my glasses.

139
00:16:01,072 --> 00:16:03,222
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to buy a butterfly.

140
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:06,509
- It's for a collector.
- Right.

141
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,862
I really like this one.

142
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:19,623
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

143
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:21,511
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

144
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:25,028
- Can you gift wrap it?
- Of course.

145
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:26,546
Thank you.

146
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:57,224
Roberto?

147
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:21,310
Silvia!

148
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:29,905
There was a woman there watching me.

149
00:19:30,472 --> 00:19:31,985
What are you talking about?

150
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:37,068
I saw her.

151
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:52,506
There is no one there.

152
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:56,221
A woman was sitting there.

153
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:58,265
No...

154
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:02,621
It's an old robe of mine.

155
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:06,703
I was expecting you,
I thought you'd be coming.

156
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:12,429
I'm afraid.

157
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:16,062
Stop acting like a child.
Kiss me.

158
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:17,904
Or don't you want to...

159
00:20:28,272 --> 00:20:30,422
I love you, Roberto.

160
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:57,468
Don't serve so hard,
it's my first time!

161
00:22:57,712 --> 00:23:00,101
I'm hardly a champion myself!

162
00:23:08,432 --> 00:23:10,662
I'm glad you invited Francesca.

163
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:13,824
She's a smart girl.

164
00:23:14,072 --> 00:23:16,905
- And Andy's hard to please.
- Silvia!

165
00:23:17,152 --> 00:23:19,666
I'm worn out,
he's too good for me.

166
00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:22,904
- Your turn.
- Come on, Silvia.

167
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,143
Just one game.

168
00:23:25,392 --> 00:23:27,428
- Don't you want to play?
- No, you go on.

169
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:31,062
I'll play later
so Andy will be tired and I'll win.

170
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:33,621
Francesca deserves a nice cold drink.

171
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:36,662
It sure is hot today.

172
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:48,508
What happened?

173
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:52,391
I grabbed the racket
and something stabbed me.

174
00:24:10,352 --> 00:24:13,822
That's strange,
there's a nail in the handle.

175
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:20,985
- I can't stand the sight of blood.
- Here...

176
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:24,188
I know what to do.

177
00:25:12,752 --> 00:25:15,027
Silvia's hurt herself.

178
00:25:16,352 --> 00:25:18,946
Silvia's hurt herself.

179
00:25:19,472 --> 00:25:21,542
Silvia's hurt herself.

180
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:39,224
Don't get angry at me,
any other night...

181
00:25:39,912 --> 00:25:42,301
It's not my fault.

182
00:25:42,552 --> 00:25:45,908
I have a screening of
that geology documentary.

183
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,707
You know I'd rather be with you.

184
00:25:49,952 --> 00:25:52,227
Weren't you going out
with Francesca?

185
00:25:52,472 --> 00:25:55,066
Andy's asked her out to dinner.

186
00:25:55,312 --> 00:25:58,065
They sure made friends fast.

187
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:05,107
I'll pick you up after work tomorrow
and we'll go out to eat.

188
00:26:05,352 --> 00:26:07,946
I found a nice place
in the country.

189
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,183
Excellent food.

190
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:11,867
Yes.

191
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:14,828
Get some sleep.

192
00:26:15,112 --> 00:26:16,625
Goodnight.

193
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,582
Can you give me a light?

194
00:27:07,432 --> 00:27:11,425
SILVIA HACHERMAN
THIRD GRADE

195
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,946
<i>Dear Daddy,</i>

196
00:27:13,192 --> 00:27:15,831
<i>I've now passed the third grade.</i>

197
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:19,542
<i>I don't want any presents,
just for you to come home.</i>

198
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:22,431
<i>Mommy said you'll be at sea
for a long time.</i>

199
00:27:22,672 --> 00:27:24,947
<i>Why did you leave us alone?</i>

200
00:27:25,192 --> 00:27:28,582
<i>The man at the animal store
gave me a black cat.</i>

201
00:27:28,832 --> 00:27:31,585
<i>He comes over
and takes us out sometimes.</i>

202
00:27:31,832 --> 00:27:34,426
<i>But he won't take us
to the zoo.</i>

203
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:38,870
<i>Mommy bawled me out
because I said he scares me.</i>

204
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:29,467
Mommy!

205
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

206
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:19,702
- I called Silvia but no one answered.
- She must be on her way.

207
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:23,385
- It's almost 11:00.
- Maybe she's ill.

208
00:30:23,632 --> 00:30:26,863
- Someone would have answered.
- Maybe the phone's off the hook.

209
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,268
Good morning!

210
00:30:36,512 --> 00:30:39,470
- There was a vase in the window.
- Which one?

211
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:42,021
It was pink with
a flower on it.

212
00:30:42,272 --> 00:30:46,185
I'm sorry, there was no vase
like that in the window.

213
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:50,391
That's impossible,
I've seen it many times.

214
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:53,829
You must be mistaken,
I do the window myself.

215
00:30:54,072 --> 00:30:56,028
Can I show you something else?

216
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,591
Miss!

217
00:31:11,112 --> 00:31:14,627
- How do you want your steak?
- Same as usual.

218
00:31:20,592 --> 00:31:22,583
Do you really have to leave?

219
00:31:23,552 --> 00:31:24,587
Yes.

220
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:29,661
- I'm sorry, but I have no choice.
- Where are they sending you?

221
00:31:30,112 --> 00:31:32,068
Cape Town.

222
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:36,307
There's a new layer,
I can get interesting samples.

223
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:40,868
I'll only be gone a week.

224
00:31:41,792 --> 00:31:43,748
I don't want you to leave.

225
00:31:48,312 --> 00:31:50,382
Stay with me tonight.

226
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,107
I need to be near you.

227
00:31:56,992 --> 00:31:59,028
I don't want to be alone.

228
00:32:35,312 --> 00:32:37,064
Mr Rossetti!

229
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:41,864
It's you, Miss Hacherman!
Just one second.

230
00:32:42,232 --> 00:32:46,828
...Fifty-seven, fifty-eight,
fifty-nine, sixty!

231
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:53,504
- It's beautiful.
- Not bad.

232
00:32:54,112 --> 00:32:56,262
That makes two hundred-twenty.

233
00:32:56,512 --> 00:32:58,468
But the first ones
were out of focus.

234
00:32:58,712 --> 00:33:00,543
You must love animals.

235
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:02,942
Just hippopotami.

236
00:33:05,512 --> 00:33:07,662
Please, Miss Hacherman...

237
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:10,631
do you mind taking off
your dark glasses?

238
00:33:10,872 --> 00:33:14,911
It bothers me talking to someone
when I can't see their eyes.

239
00:33:21,952 --> 00:33:24,227
It's unfair
to hide such beautiful eyes.

240
00:33:31,352 --> 00:33:35,391
- Don't you teach anymore?
- I quit a year ago.

241
00:33:35,632 --> 00:33:37,987
I was forced into retirement.

242
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:43,381
Ever since my wife's death,

243
00:33:43,872 --> 00:33:46,306
my life hasn't been the same.

244
00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:48,345
I know what you mean.

245
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:51,181
I feel alone too.

246
00:33:58,632 --> 00:34:01,590
How did your mother die?

247
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:07,028
I don't remember, I was very little.

248
00:34:17,752 --> 00:34:19,902
I'm glad to be here with you.

249
00:34:20,152 --> 00:34:22,302
It reminds me of
the happiest time of my life,

250
00:34:22,552 --> 00:34:24,782
when my father
would take me to the zoo.

251
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:28,104
We used to come every Sunday
when he was home from sea.

252
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:32,265
Let's take a walk.

253
00:34:35,352 --> 00:34:37,946
No, don't do that.
Turn around!

254
00:34:38,192 --> 00:34:40,547
I look terrible today!

255
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:43,829
Stand still, it will be perfect.

256
00:34:49,352 --> 00:34:52,025
One, due, three, four...

257
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:06,387
Luigi?

258
00:35:08,512 --> 00:35:09,831
Luigi!

259
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:13,462
Good evening!

260
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:17,864
I almost forgot.
There's a package for you.

261
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:27,825
Here.

262
00:35:29,272 --> 00:35:31,832
- Who's it from?
- I don't know.

263
00:35:32,072 --> 00:35:35,985
My sister received it
while I was cleaning the boiler.

264
00:35:36,232 --> 00:35:39,622
Carlotta left it with me
before she went out.

265
00:35:41,032 --> 00:35:44,308
Wait.
I'm coming up too!

266
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:47,908
- Hello, Mrs Accardini.
- I never have any mail.

267
00:35:48,152 --> 00:35:51,747
No, Chopin!
Miss Hacherman won't hurt you.

268
00:35:51,992 --> 00:35:53,823
She's a friend.

269
00:35:54,072 --> 00:35:55,346
Hello, Luigi.

270
00:35:55,592 --> 00:35:57,548
Here we are.

271
00:35:57,792 --> 00:36:00,829
You're not allergic to cats,
are you?

272
00:36:01,072 --> 00:36:04,667
Do you believe a taxi driver
wouldn't let me in with the cat?

273
00:36:05,632 --> 00:36:09,022
I can't understand why
people don't like animals.

274
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:15,626
- Who is it?
- It's me, Francesca.

275
00:37:17,472 --> 00:37:19,827
- Hi, can I come in?
- Sure.

276
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:26,192
- No Roberto?
- He left yesterday.

277
00:37:26,432 --> 00:37:29,230
- You must be lonely.
- Yes.

278
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:32,020
What a nice vase!
Is it new?

279
00:37:32,912 --> 00:37:34,106
Yes.

280
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:38,222
My mother had one like it.

281
00:37:38,712 --> 00:37:41,909
- Are they for me?
- Andy sent them to me.

282
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:46,705
It's odd though.
Twenty-four roses and two lilies.

283
00:37:46,952 --> 00:37:49,102
Funny, isn't it?

284
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:51,820
I brought some for you,
I know you like them.

285
00:37:52,072 --> 00:37:54,506
Thanks, that's so kind.

286
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:57,061
I'll put water in straight away.

287
00:37:58,752 --> 00:38:00,583
I'd better run.

288
00:38:00,832 --> 00:38:03,187
I still have to get dressed!
Bye!

289
00:38:03,432 --> 00:38:05,388
Bye and thanks.

290
00:38:19,272 --> 00:38:20,910
Silvia...

291
00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:49,381
- Is my picture ready?
- I don't know what to tell you.

292
00:40:49,632 --> 00:40:51,623
I can't find your picture anywhere.

293
00:40:51,872 --> 00:40:55,262
I've searched the entire store.

294
00:40:55,512 --> 00:41:00,028
That's impossible,
why won't you give it back?

295
00:41:00,272 --> 00:41:03,662
Maybe someone else came
to pick it up.

296
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:07,260
I want my picture back!
Give it to me!

297
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:10,663
- There's no use in getting angry...
- Don't touch me!

298
00:41:14,592 --> 00:41:17,902
Just a few friends,
they're all really swell.

299
00:41:18,152 --> 00:41:20,222
You have to be there!

300
00:41:20,472 --> 00:41:25,227
I need your help too,
you won't die without Roberto!

301
00:41:27,192 --> 00:41:29,228
I'm just not in the mood tonight.

302
00:41:29,472 --> 00:41:32,782
<i>- Come on...
- I don't feel like getting ready.</i>

303
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,385
<i>Not tonight...</i>

304
00:41:34,632 --> 00:41:38,625
I'll see you tonight
and make yourself pretty.

305
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,064
It sends shivers up my spine,
she's very good.

306
00:41:53,672 --> 00:41:56,982
I didn't think
you could do it with a photo.

307
00:41:58,912 --> 00:42:03,224
Apart from two or three things,
she guessed everything.

308
00:42:04,072 --> 00:42:08,384
Let's see if she's as good
with Miss Hacherman.

309
00:42:08,632 --> 00:42:10,748
I'd rather not.

310
00:42:10,992 --> 00:42:13,267
You go first, Francesca.

311
00:42:13,512 --> 00:42:16,345
No, I've already done it
so many times

312
00:42:16,592 --> 00:42:18,310
that Orchidea knows me by heart.

313
00:42:18,552 --> 00:42:20,986
Sorry, I'm so tired.

314
00:42:21,232 --> 00:42:24,702
- Let's not waste time.
- It's just a game, Silvia.

315
00:42:24,952 --> 00:42:26,431
Don't be afraid.

316
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:30,221
Give me your hand.
Your left hand.

317
00:42:31,512 --> 00:42:32,501
Yes.

318
00:42:35,992 --> 00:42:38,870
You're afraid.
I feel you're afraid.

319
00:42:39,752 --> 00:42:43,142
Let yourself go.
That's right.

320
00:42:43,392 --> 00:42:45,223
Clear your mind.

321
00:42:45,472 --> 00:42:50,182
I need an object, anything.

322
00:42:50,432 --> 00:42:55,347
Something that belongs to you,
something that's yours.

323
00:42:55,592 --> 00:42:58,789
- I have nothing here.
- What about that doll?

324
00:42:59,032 --> 00:43:01,102
It's in your handbag.

325
00:43:49,592 --> 00:43:53,949
Mr Rossetti went home to bed,
he's off to the seaside tomorrow.

326
00:43:54,192 --> 00:43:56,228
He said to tell you goodnight.

327
00:43:59,752 --> 00:44:02,425
Have you found it?
Let me see.

328
00:44:10,672 --> 00:44:12,981
Close your eyes.

329
00:44:39,712 --> 00:44:41,191
What is it?

330
00:44:42,152 --> 00:44:44,871
Everything's dark now.

331
00:44:46,592 --> 00:44:49,231
The boat is leaving.

332
00:44:51,232 --> 00:44:52,745
Water.

333
00:44:53,352 --> 00:44:55,547
Nothing but water.

334
00:44:58,872 --> 00:45:01,261
The wind is coming up.

335
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:05,390
I can see a man.

336
00:45:06,552 --> 00:45:09,066
Struggling against the waves.

337
00:45:10,552 --> 00:45:12,065
He's shouting:

338
00:45:13,312 --> 00:45:17,100
<i>"Silvia! Silvia!"</i>

339
00:45:23,752 --> 00:45:26,391
Now I see him sinking.

340
00:45:27,232 --> 00:45:29,348
Sinking to the depths.

341
00:45:29,712 --> 00:45:31,907
Swallowed up by the ocean.

342
00:45:33,112 --> 00:45:34,864
It's your father.

343
00:45:35,112 --> 00:45:36,591
Your father.

344
00:45:37,032 --> 00:45:39,466
Seaweed is wrapped around his body.

345
00:45:39,712 --> 00:45:42,101
Someone's hurting him.

346
00:45:44,272 --> 00:45:46,388
Why have you opened your eyes?

347
00:45:46,632 --> 00:45:50,261
I know you have,
I can't read your thoughts now.

348
00:45:50,512 --> 00:45:52,468
Not like that.

349
00:45:58,192 --> 00:46:00,706
I want to stop this game.

350
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:03,582
You can't stop now.

351
00:46:03,832 --> 00:46:05,629
It's not a game.

352
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,303
Close your eyes.

353
00:46:14,432 --> 00:46:16,992
Now I can see
when you were little.

354
00:46:19,032 --> 00:46:21,671
I see a man in your house.

355
00:46:22,712 --> 00:46:24,509
It isn't your father.

356
00:46:26,272 --> 00:46:28,866
You feel threatened by this man.

357
00:46:31,752 --> 00:46:33,026
What is it?

358
00:46:33,712 --> 00:46:37,830
Something strange,
I can't see it!

359
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:44,861
The man the little girl is afraid of
has vanished.

360
00:46:49,912 --> 00:46:52,426
Now I can see your mother.

361
00:46:53,912 --> 00:46:56,551
Your mother's putting out a flag.

362
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,149
You go up to her...

363
00:46:59,632 --> 00:47:01,782
No, Silvia! Don't do it!

364
00:47:02,032 --> 00:47:05,945
That man will pursue you
for the rest of your life!

365
00:47:07,152 --> 00:47:09,029
Stop!
That's enough!

366
00:47:09,272 --> 00:47:11,502
I hate you! I hate you!

367
00:47:15,552 --> 00:47:17,429
It's later than I thought.

368
00:47:21,312 --> 00:47:23,906
We'd better go,
they're waiting for us.

369
00:50:27,032 --> 00:50:28,511
Who is it?

370
00:52:10,872 --> 00:52:13,227
Where have you been?
I rang and rang.

371
00:52:35,472 --> 00:52:38,589
You can't stay here.
Do you know what time it is?

372
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,381
It's late for a little girl like you.

373
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:45,181
Your hair's all wet.

374
00:52:45,432 --> 00:52:48,151
- You wanted me to come, Silvia.
- Me?

375
00:52:50,032 --> 00:52:53,707
- How do you know my name?
- Where's the picture?

376
00:52:54,792 --> 00:52:57,101
You probably made mother angry.

377
00:52:58,632 --> 00:53:00,384
You should go home.

378
00:53:01,072 --> 00:53:04,189
Your parents
are probably out worrying.

379
00:53:06,592 --> 00:53:09,265
There's no point in calling anyone.

380
00:53:15,032 --> 00:53:16,590
Go away.

381
00:53:19,952 --> 00:53:21,908
Please go away.

382
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,231
Go away!

383
00:53:24,472 --> 00:53:26,940
It's late, I want to go to sleep.

384
00:53:27,192 --> 00:53:29,148
Go away, do you hear?

385
00:53:40,672 --> 00:53:41,991
It's beautiful.

386
00:53:48,272 --> 00:53:52,504
- Where did you get it?
- It's mine, it's my favourite toy.

387
00:53:56,272 --> 00:53:58,183
I had one just like it.

388
00:53:58,432 --> 00:54:02,220
That's funny,
her arm is broken.

389
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,190
Like mine.

390
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:06,986
It's mine!

391
00:54:07,872 --> 00:54:09,749
Where did you get it?
Give it to me!

392
00:54:09,992 --> 00:54:12,426
No, you're old now.

393
00:54:12,672 --> 00:54:14,902
What do you want it for, you're old!

394
00:54:34,992 --> 00:54:37,552
Open up!

395
00:54:57,632 --> 00:54:59,190
Mr Rossetti!

396
00:54:59,432 --> 00:55:01,343
Please help me!

397
00:55:01,592 --> 00:55:03,025
What's the matter?

398
00:55:03,272 --> 00:55:06,821
- Make her go away, I'm afraid.
- Who?

399
00:55:07,072 --> 00:55:08,869
Who's there?

400
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:12,071
A little girl...

401
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:14,826
A horrible girl, she won't go away.

402
00:55:15,072 --> 00:55:17,984
- A little girl?
- Yes.

403
00:55:19,912 --> 00:55:22,187
Don't worry.

404
00:55:22,912 --> 00:55:25,142
I'll see what I can do.

405
00:56:01,352 --> 00:56:03,866
Not there, in the living room.

406
00:56:20,112 --> 00:56:22,182
There's no one here at all.

407
00:56:22,992 --> 00:56:24,983
Come and see for yourself!

408
00:56:25,392 --> 00:56:29,431
There's nothing to be afraid of,
no sign of a little girl.

409
00:56:37,952 --> 00:56:39,783
That's not possible.

410
00:56:40,032 --> 00:56:42,990
You must have had a bad dream,
because of the storm.

411
00:56:44,592 --> 00:56:46,947
Look, she bit my hand.

412
00:56:47,672 --> 00:56:50,186
If she did, there's no sign of it.

413
00:56:56,512 --> 00:57:00,585
I guess you're right, it was a dream.
But it seemed so real.

414
00:57:01,672 --> 00:57:03,663
I'm sorry I bothered you.

415
00:57:03,912 --> 00:57:05,550
Don't mention it.

416
00:57:05,952 --> 00:57:07,908
Don't even joke of such a thing!

417
00:57:08,432 --> 00:57:10,388
You're like a daughter to me.

418
00:57:11,232 --> 00:57:14,588
Get a good night's sleep
and don't worry about it.

419
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:18,062
You have a spot on your shoes.

420
00:57:20,712 --> 00:57:23,784
Dear!
Another pair of shoes to clean.

421
00:57:24,952 --> 00:57:27,512
My nose bleeds
when it rains.

422
00:57:27,752 --> 00:57:29,902
Ever since I was a child.

423
00:57:31,432 --> 00:57:33,741
You get some sleep.

424
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,869
- Thank you.
- Goodnight.

425
00:58:21,432 --> 00:58:23,150
Kitty, kitty!

426
00:58:33,392 --> 00:58:36,384
Where are you hiding?

427
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:46,983
Kitty, kitty!

428
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,950
Where have you got to?

429
00:58:51,672 --> 00:58:54,266
I haven't forgotten about you.

430
00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:55,242
...She was such a lovely girl!

431
00:59:55,485 --> 00:59:58,875
She asked me to bring her mail up
but she wasn't answering.

432
01:00:00,085 --> 01:00:02,997
- How did it happen?
- They don't know.

433
01:00:03,245 --> 01:00:05,361
The poor girl must have fallen ill.

434
01:00:05,605 --> 01:00:07,960
- Does her family know?
- She had none.

435
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:09,957
She told me she was all alone.

436
01:00:10,205 --> 01:00:13,675
- Your sister found her?
- Yes, she was supposed to clean.

437
01:00:13,925 --> 01:00:18,555
She found her in the bathroom.
It was horrible!

438
01:00:18,805 --> 01:00:22,480
It must have been,
what a shock!

439
01:00:22,725 --> 01:00:25,159
- Who are you talking about?
- Miss!

440
01:00:25,405 --> 01:00:28,283
- It's dreadful!
- What happened?

441
01:00:28,525 --> 01:00:31,517
Who could have imagined,
of course it was an accident...

442
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:34,837
Francesca is dead!

443
01:00:36,325 --> 01:00:37,678
What?

444
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:40,161
- What?
- She's dead.

445
01:00:40,405 --> 01:00:42,600
They found her in the bathtub.

446
01:00:42,845 --> 01:00:47,202
She was completely naked.
It was awful.

447
01:00:47,445 --> 01:00:50,642
She must have had
too hot of a bath.

448
01:00:50,885 --> 01:00:55,117
Then felt giddy
and her heart wasn't up to it.

449
01:00:55,725 --> 01:00:59,843
She was all alone, poor creature.
What a tragedy!

450
01:01:02,485 --> 01:01:05,124
Miss!
There's no use!

451
01:01:05,365 --> 01:01:08,357
It's locked,
they've taken her body away.

452
01:01:30,205 --> 01:01:32,321
See?
I've come back early.

453
01:01:34,085 --> 01:01:36,838
- Francesca's dead.
- I know.

454
01:01:37,085 --> 01:01:38,996
It's scary.

455
01:01:40,805 --> 01:01:43,524
I didn't know
she had a weak heart.

456
01:01:44,925 --> 01:01:48,838
I'm so afraid,
all these horrible things.

457
01:01:49,485 --> 01:01:50,964
It's all right.

458
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Everything is ready.
Shall we proceed?

459
01:03:57,245 --> 01:04:00,203
<i>"Though she haunts me
phantomwise,</i>

460
01:04:00,445 --> 01:04:02,595
Alice under skies,
never seen by eyes.

461
01:04:02,845 --> 01:04:05,120
Children yet, the tale to hear.

462
01:04:05,365 --> 01:04:07,959
In a wonderland they lie.

463
01:04:08,405 --> 01:04:10,316
Dreaming as the days go by,

464
01:04:11,685 --> 01:04:13,960
dreaming as the summers die.

465
01:04:14,205 --> 01:04:16,958
Ever drifting down the stream,

466
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:20,993
lingering in the golden gleam.

467
01:04:22,565 --> 01:04:24,999
<i>Life, what is it but a dream?"</i>

468
01:07:37,405 --> 01:07:39,396
Excuse me, do you have
any blackberry jam?

469
01:07:39,645 --> 01:07:41,283
- Yes.
- I'll take all you've got.

470
01:07:41,525 --> 01:07:42,878
All right.

471
01:07:50,005 --> 01:07:51,404
Is that all you've got?

472
01:07:51,645 --> 01:07:54,955
I've got other kinds
but this is all the blackberry.

473
01:07:58,005 --> 01:08:00,235
Wait...
You forgot to pay.

474
01:08:00,805 --> 01:08:02,284
Sorry.

475
01:08:06,805 --> 01:08:10,514
Hello, sorry to bother you.
Were you sleeping?

476
01:08:10,765 --> 01:08:13,404
- No, what do you want?
- Chopin is missing!

477
01:08:13,645 --> 01:08:15,636
Have you seen him around?

478
01:08:15,885 --> 01:08:18,922
- Seen who?
- My black cat.

479
01:08:19,165 --> 01:08:22,282
He ran away last night,
he's in heat.

480
01:08:22,525 --> 01:08:25,403
I couldn't bear him mating
with one of those alley cats!

481
01:08:25,645 --> 01:08:27,761
Sorry, but I haven't seen him.

482
01:08:30,645 --> 01:08:33,113
They've all lost their minds!

483
01:09:21,725 --> 01:09:23,636
Where did you get that box?

484
01:09:24,165 --> 01:09:26,315
It's mine, I had it at home.

485
01:09:27,885 --> 01:09:29,000
Home?

486
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,842
- Where do you live?
- You know very well.

487
01:09:32,885 --> 01:09:36,002
- Via Cavalier D'Arpino.
- What?

488
01:09:36,245 --> 01:09:38,475
Via Cavalier D'Arpino, number 5.

489
01:09:39,245 --> 01:09:40,837
I've brought you a surprise.

490
01:09:58,445 --> 01:10:00,879
Why have you brought them here?

491
01:10:01,125 --> 01:10:03,923
- I've come to live with you.
- No!

492
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:10,164
I'll be happy here,
you have all that blackberry jam.

493
01:10:10,405 --> 01:10:14,637
Look under the bottom dress
for your surprise.

494
01:10:15,445 --> 01:10:17,401
I want you to be happy too.

495
01:10:32,285 --> 01:10:34,480
You shouldn't have.

496
01:10:52,685 --> 01:10:56,234
I've always wanted
a black cat of my own.

497
01:10:57,205 --> 01:11:01,198
We can have him stuffed
to look like he's alive.

498
01:11:04,765 --> 01:11:09,202
<i>Elisabeth, I'm fine.
I don't need anything.</i>

499
01:11:09,445 --> 01:11:13,723
Can you tell everyone
I've left,

500
01:11:13,965 --> 01:11:16,240
that I'll be back in a week?

501
01:11:17,005 --> 01:11:18,233
Yes.

502
01:11:19,085 --> 01:11:20,837
- Thank you.
- Okay.

503
01:11:21,085 --> 01:11:23,599
She said she'll be back
next week.

504
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:27,196
But she sounded strange.

505
01:11:49,885 --> 01:11:52,683
Yes, he said that will be fine.

506
01:11:53,325 --> 01:11:55,680
But you'll have to wait
three weeks.

507
01:11:55,965 --> 01:11:57,523
That long?

508
01:11:57,765 --> 01:11:59,596
Couldn't he do it quicker?

509
01:12:00,245 --> 01:12:03,317
It's August and we're backed up.

510
01:12:03,605 --> 01:12:05,596
I'll see what we can do.

511
01:12:07,445 --> 01:12:10,517
But you'll have to leave an advance.

512
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:14,242
Sorry but we don't accept orders
without a down payment.

513
01:12:14,685 --> 01:12:18,075
I have no money with me,
I left without my purse.

514
01:12:19,765 --> 01:12:22,233
Can you leave your name and address?

515
01:12:42,005 --> 01:12:42,960
Here.

516
01:12:44,645 --> 01:12:45,714
Thanks.

517
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:50,560
What about your telephone?

518
01:12:51,405 --> 01:12:52,804
We don't have one.

519
01:12:55,365 --> 01:12:57,799
Can you wait a moment?
I'll be right back.

520
01:13:11,525 --> 01:13:13,117
Silvia...

521
01:13:13,685 --> 01:13:16,040
Little Silvia...

522
01:13:16,285 --> 01:13:18,082
Silvia Hacherman.

523
01:13:19,685 --> 01:13:21,437
Don't you remember me?

524
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:23,884
Yes.

525
01:13:24,245 --> 01:13:25,997
You're Nicola.

526
01:13:27,885 --> 01:13:30,319
Why did you write this address?

527
01:13:31,045 --> 01:13:33,923
You know nobody lives there anymore.
Where are you going?

528
01:13:44,085 --> 01:13:46,440
I don't need you anymore.

529
01:13:53,245 --> 01:13:57,124
<i>Strong north-westerly winds.</i>

530
01:13:57,805 --> 01:14:00,080
<i>Partly sunny skies</i>

531
01:14:00,325 --> 01:14:04,238
<i>except for a few
cloud formations</i>

532
01:14:04,485 --> 01:14:09,513
<i>due to mid-Adriatic rain showers.</i>

533
01:14:29,685 --> 01:14:32,153
Have you made up your mind where?

534
01:14:32,405 --> 01:14:34,236
Via Cavalier D'Arpino, number 5.

535
01:14:34,645 --> 01:14:36,954
Behind the botanical gardens.

536
01:19:12,445 --> 01:19:15,118
Thought you'd be safe
in your old room.

537
01:19:15,365 --> 01:19:18,402
Now your mother's not here
to protect you.

538
01:19:18,605 --> 01:19:22,484
Remember how pretty she was?
You ended all that...

539
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:23,919
You...

540
01:19:25,285 --> 01:19:27,594
...murdering little bitch!

541
01:19:47,965 --> 01:19:50,195
Remember your mother?

542
01:19:50,405 --> 01:19:53,875
Impaled on the spikes
of the front gate?

543
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

544
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:06,638
What are you doing here?

545
01:22:09,085 --> 01:22:11,315
What's your problem?

546
01:22:15,885 --> 01:22:17,876
I don't want to go home.

547
01:22:18,085 --> 01:22:21,521
- Nicola.
- What are you talking about?

548
01:22:24,605 --> 01:22:26,357
I killed him.

549
01:22:29,005 --> 01:22:31,155
- Hold me.
- Another one of your fantasies...

550
01:22:38,485 --> 01:22:41,158
In there, in my old bedroom.

551
01:22:46,885 --> 01:22:48,876
In your old bedroom...

552
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:59,196
There's no one at all.

553
01:23:00,285 --> 01:23:02,924
Come in, there's nobody here.

554
01:23:03,685 --> 01:23:05,596
See for yourself.

555
01:23:06,485 --> 01:23:08,715
Where is this man?

556
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:13,638
- Why did you come to this place?
- It's my house.

557
01:23:19,045 --> 01:23:20,603
Listen.

558
01:23:21,805 --> 01:23:24,114
Silvia's back.

559
01:23:25,325 --> 01:23:27,520
- I have to go home.
- Stop it.

560
01:23:28,365 --> 01:23:30,162
That's enough of this.

561
01:23:30,725 --> 01:23:33,000
- I'm taking you home.
- Don't touch me!

562
01:23:33,205 --> 01:23:34,957
I'm not yours!

563
01:24:08,925 --> 01:24:10,677
<i>Hello, Silvia?</i>

564
01:24:10,885 --> 01:24:14,434
<i>Silvia?
Answer me!</i>

565
01:24:26,605 --> 01:24:28,277
Only Silvia's good.

566
01:24:28,485 --> 01:24:31,716
Everyone else is evil
and wants to hurt us.

567
01:24:31,925 --> 01:24:35,554
Only Silvia's good.
Only Silvia's good.

568
01:24:39,925 --> 01:24:41,756
Stop it!

569
01:24:43,325 --> 01:24:46,795
Stop it!
You've got to get ready!

570
01:25:08,165 --> 01:25:12,078
Don't leave me,
don't ever leave me.

571
01:25:12,725 --> 01:25:14,602
No one else loves me.

572
01:25:15,565 --> 01:25:17,999
Today is a big holiday.

573
01:25:19,525 --> 01:25:22,995
You must look your best.
The whole city's lit up.

574
01:25:24,685 --> 01:25:26,118
I'm so glad.

575
01:25:27,845 --> 01:25:31,633
Now you must do what I say,
you must obey me.

576
01:25:33,285 --> 01:25:34,354
Yes.

577
01:27:27,125 --> 01:27:30,162
<i>"'The Dormouse is asleep again,'
said the Mad Hatter.</i>

578
01:27:30,365 --> 01:27:33,641
And he poured hot tea on his nose.

579
01:27:33,845 --> 01:27:36,962
The Dormouse
shook his head impatiently

580
01:27:37,165 --> 01:27:39,042
and said without opening his eyes:

581
01:27:39,245 --> 01:27:42,794
'Of course,
I was about to say so myself! '

582
01:27:43,805 --> 01:27:48,674
'Have you solved the riddle? '
Said the Mad Hatter turning to Alice.

583
01:27:50,205 --> 01:27:52,514
'What is the answer? '

584
01:27:53,165 --> 01:27:56,362
<i>'I haven't the faintest idea,'
replied Alice."</i>

585
01:28:01,045 --> 01:28:04,276
We can't play without the Mad Hatter!
Call Roberto.

586
01:28:17,445 --> 01:28:20,243
Is this game that important?

587
01:28:36,885 --> 01:28:39,353
It's a fun game.

588
01:28:40,165 --> 01:28:42,156
Today is a big holiday.

589
01:28:42,365 --> 01:28:46,074
I've invited some friends
and made some tea.

590
01:28:46,325 --> 01:28:48,122
You were the only one missing.

591
01:29:49,405 --> 01:29:51,555
Now we can start.

592
01:29:51,765 --> 01:29:54,484
You'll be the Mad Hatter.

593
01:29:56,125 --> 01:29:59,913
<i>"The Dormouse is asleep again,"
said the Mad Hatter.</i>

594
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:03,003
And he poured hot tea on his nose.

595
01:30:25,205 --> 01:30:28,561
Where are you going?
Why don't you stay?

596
01:30:30,485 --> 01:30:32,282
Wait for me!

597
01:30:36,325 --> 01:30:39,795
Music!
Do you want to go see the band?
