1
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,330
I drove out to the orphanage today.

2
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,880
I go every month, remember?

3
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,170
The children are so cute.

4
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,470
If I have a child, maybe I'll raise her
out there in the country.

5
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,350
Show her flowers and trees.
Plus, it's close to Seoul.

6
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,390
The tow truck?

7
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,600
They said it'll take a while.

8
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,820
I love your voice.

9
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,490
It feels romantic
to hear your voice in the snow.

10
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,420
Hold on a moment.

11
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,380
Got a flat tire?

12
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,590
Yes, I called a tow truck.

13
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,470
In this snow,
it could take a while.

14
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,310
Hold on.
Let me take a look.

15
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,730
I said it's okay,
but he's looking at it.

16
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,860
Really?

17
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,740
Just wait for the tow truck.

18
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,580
No, it's not hard
to change a flat tire.

19
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,960
But why bother
when a tow truck's coming?

20
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,510
Hold on a sec.

21
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,550
Status?

22
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,470
Okay, got it.

23
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,180
Hello? Ju-yeon?
I would better get going.

24
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,110
Lock the doors
and just wait for the tow truck.

25
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,650
What?

26
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,070
Hold on.

27
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,340
Love is...

28
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,680
Sweet like...

29
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,300
A mother's...

30
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,430
Tow truck's on its way.

31
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,690
Why does he bother?

32
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,730
Too many people here today.

33
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,990
Sorry to be working
on your birthday again.

34
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,870
I'll be home soon.

35
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,090
Your car's completely sunk.

36
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,100
Thank you, but I'll just wait
for the tow truck.

37
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,890
Thank you.

38
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,350
STUDENT SAFETY VEHICLE

39
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,360
Why isn't he leaving?

40
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

41
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,030
Mister...

42
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,860
Mister...

43
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,950
Wait...

44
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,560
Your skin's so soft,
looks like it'll be easy.

45
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,530
Please don't kill me.

46
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,120
Why not?

47
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm...

48
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,790
...pregnant.

49
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,810
Please, let me live.

50
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,980
Dong-su! Dong-su!

51
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,440
- What?
- Come here, quick!

52
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,410
Chief!
Why did you come here?

53
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,410
Stay at home.
We'll keep you posted.

54
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,830
What's going on?

55
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,590
What happened to my daughter?

56
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,050
Don't look!

57
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,590
Nothing's for sure yet.

58
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,170
- Detective Cho!
- What?

59
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,500
What's this?

60
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,800
Move it.

61
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,510
It looks like a head.

62
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,720
Flip it.

63
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,540
Forensics!
Come here, quick!

64
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,340
We found the head!

65
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,140
Look after Chief Jang!

66
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,520
Chief! Sir!

67
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,320
Ju-yeon! Ju-yeon!

68
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,270
Stop taking pictures!

69
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,690
You call yourselves humans?!

70
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,230
Block them off!

71
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,170
At least, heaven helped us.

72
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,390
Otherwise,
we might never have found her.

73
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,480
How ironic.

74
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,560
I was a police detective
for over 30 years...

75
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,190
And I couldn't even protect
my own daughter.

76
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,580
Stop smoking, sir.

77
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,760
I'm sorry.

78
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,550
Really.

79
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,770
I'm so sorry.

80
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,610
To you...

81
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,780
And to Ju-yeon...

82
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,910
I'm so sorry.

83
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,940
Forgive me, Ju-yeon.

84
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,240
I wasn't there for you.

85
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,410
Always late...

86
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,660
Never there when you needed me.

87
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,750
But Ju-yeon...

88
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,880
I promise you this.

89
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:34,640
I'll make him pay for your pain.

90
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,690
Soo-hyun...

91
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,450
For how long?

92
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,410
There's no rush.
Do you want one or two months off?

93
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,240
All I need is two weeks, sir.

94
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,500
Take more days.

95
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,500
No, I'll see you in two weeks, sir.

96
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,710
That would be good for us...

97
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,590
But are you sure?

98
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,270
Then I'll see to it.
I hope you recover from your grief.

99
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,110
Get some rest.

100
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,530
How could this happen?

101
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,040
Didn't he get engaged
just last month?

102
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,540
I don't believe this.

103
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,670
The capsule is equipped
with GPS and a microphone.

104
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,210
Cool, isn't it?

105
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,470
Good job.

106
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,970
Thanks.

107
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,640
Sure.

108
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,310
Aren't you going back?

109
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,650
Huh?

110
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,320
Anything else to tell me?

111
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,320
No.

112
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,860
Right.

113
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,910
As you know,
I snuck this out.

114
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,790
If something goes wrong,
you and I will...

115
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,420
Don't worry.

116
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,790
Nothing will go wrong.

117
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,970
It looks like the police...

118
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,480
Think these four
are the main suspects.

119
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,780
They've been accused
of similar crimes before.

120
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,700
- Hi, Soo-hyun.
- Hi.

121
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,660
Did you have dinner already?

122
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,410
I would better get going.

123
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,380
I brought some groceries for Dad.

124
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,510
I'll be going then.
Take care, sir.

125
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,300
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

126
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,070
Shit.

127
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,820
Quiet!

128
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,200
Remember this?

129
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,950
You really don't know?

130
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,590
Fine.

131
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,310
Sir.

132
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,820
What the hell is with him?
He's turning himself in?

133
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,070
Says he killed the girl found
at Bangho Creek two months ago.

134
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,120
And the missing Shinchon girl case
a few years back.

135
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,240
All of a sudden,
he has a conscience?

136
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,450
What the hell? Who did this?
You bastards?

137
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,370
No, sir.

138
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,540
An ambulance came
so I ran up to see.

139
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,920
And this bastard
was practically dying.

140
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,130
What the heck happened?

141
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,550
Well, he didn't say anything yet.

142
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,640
What the hell happened last night?

143
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,350
Help... me... please.

144
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,480
Help... me...

145
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,150
What's he saying?

146
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:59,780
Some bastard hammered his balls.

147
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,150
What?

148
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,780
That's insane!

149
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,530
Who broke your balls?

150
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,110
Who are you?

151
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,160
What the hell!

152
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:47,340
The buses have stopped running.
Where are you headed?

153
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,920
Pardon me?

154
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,090
Where are you going?

155
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,630
To Sung-min Apartments.

156
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Sung-min?

157
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,350
Well, it's kind of on the way.
Hop in.

158
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,520
I'll give you a ride.

159
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,640
It's okay, but thanks.

160
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,810
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

161
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,400
No, really. It's okay.

162
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,690
It's just down the road.
Hop in.

163
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,910
It's fine.

164
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,630
You sure it's on your way?

165
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:34,260
Don't worry. Get in.

166
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,530
What?

167
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,490
Huh? Nothing.

168
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,460
Is this a school van?

169
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,110
Ah... shit.
Where did I put it?

170
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,600
Why?

171
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,310
Huh?

172
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,110
Why do you look
like you stepped in shit?

173
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,400
Never seen a thing like this?

174
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,020
Who's there?

175
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,960
Why do you need this
for the insurance money?

176
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:01,170
I have to identify
the policy holder.

177
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,300
There are too many people
with the same name.

178
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,550
These are all old pictures.

179
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,320
Perhaps this one would do.

180
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,280
I'll ask a few more
standard questions.

181
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:33,160
Do you have additional
contact numbers for him?

182
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,460
I don't.
But his son does.

183
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,880
Sang-won! Sang-won!

184
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,130
Where did he go?

185
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:52,310
I think it was Yang-pyung
or Chung-pyung...

186
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:58,810
Can you verify that this person is
the man I'm looking for?

187
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,570
Is this Mr. Jang Kyung-chul?

188
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,450
It's Kyung-chul alright.

189
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,330
But...

190
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,580
Is this a recent picture?

191
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:24,760
Why does he look so scary?

192
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,680
Insurance, my ass.

193
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,890
He doesn't give a shit
about anyone.

194
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,600
He abandoned his parents
and his son.

195
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,360
Like he would really take out
a family insurance policy?

196
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,900
It doesn't make any sense!

197
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,070
Don't talk like that!

198
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,530
Am I wrong?

199
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,490
No use protecting him.

200
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,200
- Shut up! You old fool!
- You call that a "son"?

201
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,830
Shut up!
Don't get me started!

202
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,080
How can you say that?

203
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,170
If you can't say something nice,
don't say anything!

204
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,840
Fuck!

205
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,390
By the way...

206
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:16,350
Doesn't the family get the money
if the policy holder dies?

207
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,300
Are you Sang-won?

208
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,640
Do you know
where your dad lives?

209
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,020
Shit!

210
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,020
Why?

211
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,430
She's a really good singer.

212
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,520
- Maybe I can go.
- Of course you'll go.

213
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,940
My mom is gonna kill me.

214
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:33,440
Go straight home, girls. Okay?

215
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,610
Yes, ma'am.

216
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,610
Please drive them straight home.

217
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,780
Of course.

218
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,660
- Thank you.
- Sure.

219
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,160
Shit.

220
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,460
- Can I help you?
- Is Jang Kyung-chul here?

221
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:35,170
- Why? Is there a problem?
- We're the police. Where is he?

222
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,540
He's driving the kids home.

223
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,760
Shit. Call his cell phone, now!
Hurry!

224
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,690
LEARNING CENTER

225
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,820
Shit.

226
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,580
Do not cry on me.

227
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:08,640
Do not cry like a baby.

228
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,390
Let's see.

229
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,140
You have fair skin.

230
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,770
It's okay.

231
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,900
It'll be over quick.

232
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:08,820
I lost my damn job.

233
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:14,370
Looks like things are fucked up.

234
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:19,960
But...

235
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,090
Shit!
Who says I can't like you?

236
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:27,590
What's wrong with that?

237
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,390
I can like you if I want.

238
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:35,640
Damn bitches in the world
are always against me.

239
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:39,100
I can! Can't I?

240
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,650
Shit.

241
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:49,780
It'll be over quickly.

242
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,030
I'll make it quick for you.

243
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,430
Jang Kyung-chul.

244
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,000
What?
You're alone?

245
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,420
Are you a cop?

246
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,940
Must be right.

247
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,530
The cops found me this quick?

248
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,570
You're shitting me.

249
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:45,660
Guess you don't know
who you're dealing with.

250
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,670
Damn cops.

251
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:51,380
What do you expect...

252
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,050
Anyway...

253
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:45,890
You son of a bitch!

254
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:49,140
Bastard !

255
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,440
What the hell?

256
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,610
The bastard's a complete psycho.

257
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,630
Shit!

258
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:35,430
Oh, fuck...

259
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:13,340
Don't know where you're headed,
but you can hop in.

260
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,260
You don't want a ride?
There won't be other cars.

261
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,980
Why are you
all the way out here alone?

262
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:30,320
You're pretty lucky, Mister.
Catching a cab out here.

263
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,610
It's on the way
for the man in the back.

264
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,490
You don't mind, right?

265
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,370
Of course not.

266
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,140
It must have been hard
to get a cab here.

267
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,310
Cars hardly ever go by here.

268
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:06,560
I don't come here much.
Just for work.

269
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:11,440
You're really lucky, Mister.

270
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,900
Did you hear?

271
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:17,780
Strange things have been
happening around here.

272
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:21,080
So there aren't
any passengers out at nights.

273
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,580
But I have two tonight.

274
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:29,540
Looks like I'm lucky, too.
Right, Mister?

275
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,890
Way out here
in the dark night.

276
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,820
What, Mister?

277
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:59,950
What's so funny?

278
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,950
Mister?

279
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,870
Yes?

280
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:09,670
You said we're all lucky, right?

281
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,880
Yeah, I did.

282
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,550
So?

283
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,800
The way I see it...

284
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,760
I think you're damn unlucky.

285
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,060
Crazy bastards.

286
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:32,830
You're young.
it'll heal fast.

287
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,710
And soccer...

288
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:39,290
Don't play so rough
that you break your wrists, okay?

289
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,510
Who plays soccer with
their wrists anyway?

290
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:47,220
Go easy, son. Got it?

291
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,980
Get going now.

292
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,690
Hey, shithead.

293
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:07,360
I am not your son!

294
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,490
Shit.
Watch the way you talk!

295
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,540
Take off your glasses!

296
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:24,880
Take them off!

297
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:30,890
Shit!

298
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,140
Come here, you!

299
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,350
Come here!

300
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,560
Excuse me?

301
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,900
Please come and get
your prescription.

302
01:03:55,830 --> 01:04:00,080
Damn old folks always
talking down to people!

303
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,750
I'll rip your mouth off!

304
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:12,220
Watch yourself.

305
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,430
How old are you?

306
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,110
Twenty-two.

307
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:26,480
Nice and young.

308
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:29,110
Got a boyfriend?

309
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,700
Excuse me?

310
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:35,410
Bet you have many, huh?

311
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:40,750
Ah... no. I don't.

312
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,500
You fucking playing with me?

313
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,460
A pretty girl like you
without a boyfriend?

314
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,390
You don't know how to do it?

315
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,350
Excuse me?

316
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,980
If you don't, you don't.

317
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,140
Actually...

318
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:22,600
I was about to have
a good time last night.

319
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:28,060
But some bastard
came and ruined everything.

320
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,490
So...

321
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:37,110
Let's make this easy.

322
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:07,270
Take it off.

323
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,730
What?

324
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:16,990
Strip.

325
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:22,410
Try and enjoy it.

326
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:26,660
So, take it off.

327
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:49,140
Strip before I cut up
your face, bitch!

328
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,190
Strip now, bitch!

329
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:51,040
That's it.

330
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:01,760
Take off your bra.
Hurry.

331
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:17,230
Please...

332
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:34,000
Good.
Take off your skirt.

333
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,890
You son of a bitch!

334
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:13,640
Who the fuck are you?

335
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,680
You bastard!

336
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:10,570
Wait!

337
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:14,620
Stay here.
He'll need to be treated.

338
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,460
Don't act so weak.
This is just the beginning.

339
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,880
Remember...

340
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,840
Your nightmare's
only getting worse.

341
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:37,180
Close your eyes, Miss!

342
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:39,600
Look away and
plug your ears.

343
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:19,030
Son of a bitch!

344
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:53,440
Damn motherfucker!
You want to die?

345
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:04,620
You want to fight me, huh?

346
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:07,750
Damn son of a bitch!

347
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,040
Motherfucker.

348
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:15,800
Fine! Let's see who's the bitch here!
You bastard!

349
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,420
What happened, sir?

350
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:35,750
Did you have an accident?

351
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:48,560
His car must have stalled.

352
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,450
Damn dogs.

353
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:51,330
Always going wild...

354
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:55,540
At the smell of blood.

355
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,450
Yes, sir.

356
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:33,830
Is everything okay?

357
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:41,500
Just worried that's all.

358
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:48,800
The police think
I'm chasing after Jang.

359
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:53,850
The cops are after him
themselves as well.

360
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:57,150
I was thinking...

361
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:05,610
How about dropping it now?

362
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:09,410
- Sir...
- You've done enough.

363
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,240
I want you to stop.

364
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:13,830
But, sir...

365
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:28,340
Forget it.

366
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:31,430
Talk to you later.

367
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,810
It's me. Se-yeon.

368
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:41,860
- Soo-hyun.
- Hi, how are you?

369
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,860
Good.
How are you?

370
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:47,860
Well, just busy
working on something.

371
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:51,450
Really?
What kind of work?

372
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:55,450
You know what I do.

373
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:59,370
I'm asking about
what we don't know.

374
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:02,790
Dad gave you
the police files, right?

375
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,590
Soo-hyun?

376
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,010
I know how you feel,
but I hope you'll stop.

377
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,720
It won't bring her back.

378
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:21,520
Whatever you do to punish him,
things won't change.

379
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:25,900
Revenge is for movies.

380
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:28,190
That bastard's a psycho.

381
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:33,410
Sorry. I have nothing
to say to you.

382
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:36,120
How come?

383
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:38,620
We're practically family.

384
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,670
You know how I am
these days?

385
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:48,300
I keep looking back,
thinking I'm being followed.

386
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,390
And you have nothing to say?

387
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:03,060
So, please.

388
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:06,940
This is pointless.
Please drop it.

389
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:11,280
Sorry, I would better go.

390
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:15,780
And this is not pointless.

391
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:19,000
Soo-hyun!

392
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,970
Water!

393
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:18,510
Get me water!

394
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,700
Aren't you sick of it?

395
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,290
Try it.

396
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,500
You can't get sick of it.

397
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:51,590
Once you taste this,

398
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,880
you can't eat any other meat.

399
01:22:57,050 --> 01:22:59,550
Crazy bastard.

400
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,110
What did you just say?

401
01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:18,450
Why you little...

402
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:23,540
Gone insane from
eating human flesh?

403
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:28,210
Wake up!
I'm Jang Kyung-chul!

404
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:52,820
Yeah,
I must be damn crazy.

405
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:56,150
This meat's so good,
I lost my mind.

406
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:05,200
Why do I cry when I get tense?

407
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Crazy bastard.

408
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,300
Remember when we first met?

409
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:28,060
Trying to form a militant group
to fuck over the world!

410
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,320
Those were the days.

411
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:37,360
We weren't afraid of anything!

412
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:41,160
Cut the bullshit
and give me a cigarette.

413
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,650
Bet he's a family member
of a bitch you killed.

414
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,650
If not, he's some total maniac.

415
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,160
He's our kind.

416
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:34,000
He's enjoying the excitement
of the hunt.

417
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:41,670
Catching and letting go
of the prey.

418
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,430
He's playing the hunter.

419
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:46,720
He relishes torturing his prey.

420
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,930
Man...

421
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:55,650
I think you're screwed this time.

422
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:04,280
The bastard must have gone crazy
after losing his bitch.

423
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:09,790
You've created a monster.
How interesting.

424
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:32,140
Get some sleep.
We've got plenty of rooms.

425
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,350
You can sleep anywhere.

426
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:40,480
I'll go prep my next meal.

427
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:00,500
Damn bastards.

428
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,140
He's enjoying the excitement
of the hunt.

429
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:20,150
Catching and letting go
of the prey.

430
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:22,860
He relishes torturing his prey.

431
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:29,030
He's playing the hunter.

432
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,660
Your nightmare 's
only getting worse.

433
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:45,300
Amusing...

434
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,440
Now...

435
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,770
I used up all the guts?

436
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:08,030
Not here, either?

437
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,360
Then...

438
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:33,100
Shit.

439
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,730
Come on.

440
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:26,230
Didn't you see your sister?

441
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:31,450
If you fight it,
it'll be more painful.

442
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:39,700
I'll end it quickly for you.

443
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:46,750
So why be suspicious of us?

444
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:50,170
We didn't ask for money
or the house!

445
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:53,510
Couldn't let us in, huh?

446
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,760
I'm sorry.

447
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:58,310
I'm really sorry!

448
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:06,810
Should have apologized
a long time ago.

449
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,610
Damn bitches.

450
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:15,660
Always acting up
when it's too late.

451
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:18,200
Wait.

452
01:30:18,370 --> 01:30:20,870
Hands, feet,
then head, was it?

453
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:26,330
Close your eyes.
Better not to look.

454
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,360
Where the hell?

455
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:41,620
How did you come in
without making a sound?

456
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:18,490
I'm... pregnant.

457
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:26,660
I was wondering about you.

458
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:30,210
You don't look like a monster.

459
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:34,630
Sick bastard.

460
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:45,780
Hands, feet, then head.
Right?

461
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:48,620
Just like you did.

462
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:51,080
Nothing more, nothing less.

463
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,830
You sick psychos!

464
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:54,570
Son of a bitch.

465
01:38:15,010 --> 01:38:18,810
Why? Why? Why?

466
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:28,060
Why, why...

467
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:31,820
Why...

468
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,670
I'm actually relieved.

469
01:40:08,830 --> 01:40:11,920
You had me worried sick
about you.

470
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:16,920
It's secret agent
Kim Soo-hyun, right?

471
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:21,430
Want me to show you
what he's been up to?

472
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:30,060
Make him stop.

473
01:40:30,230 --> 01:40:33,060
He can't become a monster
to fight the monster.

474
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:39,320
You know that's wrong.

475
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:43,160
Where is he now?

476
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:46,950
Your wounds are treated.
You'll be okay.

477
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:54,670
You and that bastard
were out for two days.

478
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:59,630
What happened?

479
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:04,010
Sir?

480
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:05,970
Hand the bastard over.

481
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:10,640
I'm far from done.

482
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:12,850
What are you going to do?

483
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:17,030
You know...

484
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:22,160
It feels like a huge rock is
pressing down on my chest.

485
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:26,200
Big and heavy.

486
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:36,130
I promised Ju-yeon that
I would make him feel the same pain.

487
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:41,130
It's not over.

488
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:45,890
Far from it.

489
01:41:48,350 --> 01:41:51,730
Okay, no more questions.

490
01:41:51,890 --> 01:41:54,100
By the way,
how's the capsule working?

491
01:41:54,270 --> 01:41:56,860
Unless he has diarrhea...

492
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:06,200
Don't worry.
The bastard's completely out.

493
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:09,290
He'll be out
for another day at least.

494
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:19,710
Sir?

495
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:22,300
You've changed a lot,
you know?

496
01:43:57,310 --> 01:43:58,770
Hello.

497
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:01,270
Pain killers, please.
With dexibuprofen.

498
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,730
Dexi what, sir?

499
01:44:04,730 --> 01:44:07,610
- Just give me the strongest kind.
- Sure.

500
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:14,540
Where are you?
Guess you aren't around.

501
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:17,660
Are you listening?

502
01:44:17,830 --> 01:44:20,420
Of course you are.

503
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:27,260
It's been a blast.
Totally unexpected fun.

504
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:31,340
You!

505
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:34,600
Want me to guess
who you are?

506
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:38,850
Your bitch was Ju-yeon?
From Yeon-hee-dong, right?

507
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:42,770
You hear me?

508
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:45,730
But, you made a mistake.

509
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:50,030
You took me for granted.

510
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:53,950
You'll regret not killing me.

511
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:55,790
I'll get you soon.

512
01:44:55,950 --> 01:44:57,410
Hello, there.

513
01:44:57,580 --> 01:45:02,380
Wait.
I'll show you what real pain is!

514
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:06,380
What are you doing!

515
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,420
Hey, you!

516
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:12,720
By the way...

517
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:16,430
Before she died, she said...

518
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:18,470
That she was pregnant.

519
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:22,150
Begged for her life.

520
01:45:25,270 --> 01:45:27,440
Did you know?

521
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:40,710
Go! Go! Get here quick!
Or the man I left inside is dead!

522
01:45:42,580 --> 01:45:45,420
Should keep close range
when hunting me.

523
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:16,260
What the hell!

524
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:31,080
Where have you gone?

525
01:48:55,150 --> 01:48:59,240
Do we have to do all this
to save bastards like them?

526
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:05,030
Seeing scum like them
makes me sorry to be human.

527
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:07,540
Call me when they wake up.

528
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:17,380
What is it this time?

529
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:20,170
Yeah. What is it?

530
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:24,180
What?

531
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:27,850
Are you sure?

532
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:31,690
Okay.

533
01:49:33,690 --> 01:49:35,310
Hey.

534
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:37,230
Jang Kyung-chul is
turning himself in.

535
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:39,610
You made a damn mistake fool!

536
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,710
Wake up.

537
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:48,890
I have a question.

538
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:51,850
Where might our friend be?

539
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:09,660
You ticked off the wrong guy.

540
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:15,670
He always gets even.

541
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:17,630
Know what that means?

542
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:27,300
First your girl, then her family.

543
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:36,560
Then he'll give himself up
to the cops.

544
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:41,730
But...

545
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:46,400
Your woman didn't have it
all that bad.

546
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:54,870
Unlike me, Jang likes to give
pleasure before pain.

547
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:01,540
He gives pleasure first.
Get it?

548
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:07,970
Funny?

549
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:11,930
That's funny?

550
01:52:12,930 --> 01:52:15,390
You think it's funny?

551
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:27,570
I'll give you
a permanent smiley face!

552
01:52:35,910 --> 01:52:38,160
I traced Jang's call.

553
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:42,040
I was tapping the cops
investigating Jang.

554
01:52:42,210 --> 01:52:45,840
Jang just called them.
Said he'll turn himself in today.

555
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:51,800
He says he's doing something first.
What if he fucks up again?

556
01:52:51,970 --> 01:52:53,470
Where's he located?

557
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:54,680
Yeon-hee-dong.

558
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:21,250
Parcel delivery!

559
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:44,440
Is this Captain Oh?

560
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:47,400
I'm Kim Soo-hyun.

561
01:53:47,570 --> 01:53:49,900
What?

562
01:53:50,070 --> 01:53:53,990
What the hell have you done?

563
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:58,740
If something happens to him,
I'll kill you!

564
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:01,410
Got that, you bastard?

565
01:54:06,210 --> 01:54:09,170
Send the closest men
to the Chief's house now!

566
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:12,420
Turn the car around!

567
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:15,920
Not much resemblance.

568
01:56:16,090 --> 01:56:19,260
Ju-yeon must have taken after
her mom.

569
01:56:20,430 --> 01:56:22,550
Good thing
she doesn't look like you.

570
01:56:28,060 --> 01:56:31,230
Why did you come at me like that?
Old bastard!

571
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:34,320
You crazy? Huh?

572
01:56:36,610 --> 01:56:40,740
Wait a minute.
Where did I put it?

573
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:48,290
What should I do
to make that bastard flip?

574
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:51,170
Will this do the trick?
Like this?

575
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:55,840
And this! And this!

576
01:56:57,300 --> 01:57:00,260
Like this? Fuck.

577
01:57:57,780 --> 01:57:59,940
Dad?

578
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:03,610
I'm home.

579
01:58:55,210 --> 01:58:56,630
- What's going on?
- Stay back.

580
01:58:56,790 --> 01:58:58,290
Back away, please!

581
01:58:58,460 --> 01:59:00,590
- Stay back.
- What happened?

582
01:59:00,750 --> 01:59:03,050
You can't come in, sir.

583
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:11,010
Who the hell?

584
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:17,350
What is it? Step aside.

585
01:59:18,980 --> 01:59:21,480
You're Kim Soo-hyun?

586
01:59:26,610 --> 01:59:29,030
You stupid son of a bitch!

587
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:34,620
You know what you did?
How dare you come here!

588
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:37,210
Damn piece of shit.

589
01:59:37,370 --> 01:59:40,500
Back off. Let go!

590
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:47,180
Damn son of a bitch.

591
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:54,770
Step aside. Move!

592
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

593
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:31,240
Hello?

594
02:01:31,410 --> 02:01:33,530
Jang Kyung-chul here.

595
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:36,700
You bastard!

596
02:01:38,870 --> 02:01:41,710
Where the hell are you?

597
02:01:41,870 --> 02:01:45,130
You didn't hurt Se-yeon
did you?

598
02:01:45,290 --> 02:01:48,380
You'll find out later.

599
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:55,350
What?

600
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:04,560
Take this.

601
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:22,330
Hello?

602
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:33,470
So?
How does it feel?

603
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:39,470
You shouldn't have fucked with me!
You piece of shit!

604
02:02:40,470 --> 02:02:43,270
Who do you think won?

605
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:45,900
You think you won?
Or me?

606
02:04:13,690 --> 02:04:16,190
Jang Kyung-chul!

607
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:18,490
Sir! it's Jang!

608
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:20,700
Wait! Not now!

609
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:25,060
Search the car!

610
02:05:29,770 --> 02:05:31,600
What's that car?

611
02:05:34,270 --> 02:05:35,520
What the hell!

612
02:05:35,690 --> 02:05:37,360
Stop that car!

613
02:05:41,530 --> 02:05:42,660
Stop it now!

614
02:05:52,830 --> 02:05:54,460
Get him!

615
02:05:58,710 --> 02:06:00,300
Catch him!

616
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:01,840
Get him!

617
02:07:08,780 --> 02:07:11,120
Okay, you're right.

618
02:07:13,660 --> 02:07:15,870
I made a mistake.

619
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:25,510
I underestimated you.

620
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:42,780
I'll treat you right
from now on.

621
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:51,160
You son of a bitch!

622
02:07:51,330 --> 02:07:54,450
What the hell are you doing?

623
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:59,920
Come on.
I'm just getting started.

624
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:08,430
Kill me!
You son of a bitch!

625
02:08:08,590 --> 02:08:10,390
Kill me, now!

626
02:08:10,550 --> 02:08:12,600
You son of a bitch!

627
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:18,560
Hurry up and kill me!
You bastard!

628
02:08:18,730 --> 02:08:20,770
Kill me now!

629
02:08:28,950 --> 02:08:32,620
Not yet.
It won't be long.

630
02:08:36,370 --> 02:08:40,460
If it was that easy,
I would've killed you already.

631
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:46,970
I'll kill you at your most
painful moment.

632
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:54,140
When you most tremble
in pain and fear,

633
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:55,970
I'll kill you then!

634
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:04,400
Because only that
will be real revenge.

635
02:09:06,030 --> 02:09:08,450
True revenge.

636
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:23,210
Let me live. Please?

637
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:26,000
Don't kill me.

638
02:09:26,170 --> 02:09:29,050
Please...

639
02:09:34,510 --> 02:09:39,310
Heard that many times, haven't you?
People begging for their lives.

640
02:09:44,270 --> 02:09:46,570
You enjoyed that, huh?

641
02:09:47,690 --> 02:09:52,030
Don't kill me, please.

642
02:09:59,660 --> 02:10:03,920
I'll pay for my sins.

643
02:10:07,590 --> 02:10:09,550
So...

644
02:10:11,550 --> 02:10:17,970
Let me go, please.

645
02:10:20,100 --> 02:10:24,980
Haven't you done enough?

646
02:10:25,980 --> 02:10:28,440
Please, don't kill me.

647
02:10:47,790 --> 02:10:50,510
I'm so sorry.

648
02:11:02,770 --> 02:11:06,020
I beg you.

649
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:21,330
Are you scared?

650
02:11:26,210 --> 02:11:29,790
Say it.
You're scared?

651
02:11:35,260 --> 02:11:40,560
Do you realize now
what you've done?

652
02:12:03,790 --> 02:12:08,370
Stop fucking around with me!

653
02:12:08,540 --> 02:12:11,880
You son of a bitch!

654
02:12:17,050 --> 02:12:19,340
Hey.

655
02:12:19,510 --> 02:12:23,180
Cut the bullshit.

656
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:28,350
You already lost.

657
02:12:31,150 --> 02:12:34,780
You think you got to me?

658
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:37,110
Huh?

659
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:41,370
Fuck you.

660
02:12:43,740 --> 02:12:48,500
I don't know what pain is.

661
02:12:49,540 --> 02:12:54,130
Fear?
Don't know that, either.

662
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:02,390
There's nothing
you can get from me.

663
02:13:09,850 --> 02:13:12,150
So...

664
02:13:13,190 --> 02:13:15,650
You already lost.

665
02:13:18,860 --> 02:13:21,030
Got that?

666
02:13:50,440 --> 02:13:52,600
I hope...

667
02:13:54,230 --> 02:13:57,650
That you suffer even after you die.

668
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:50,560
Son of a bitch!
You hear me?

669
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:58,600
You shit! It isn't over.
I'll live no matter what!

670
02:15:58,770 --> 02:16:02,320
You hear me, shithead?

671
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:05,780
I'm not scared!

672
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:12,950
You think you can fuck with me?

673
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:22,880
Dad?

674
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:26,130
Dad?

675
02:16:28,890 --> 02:16:30,550
Hey!

676
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:33,970
Don't open the door!

677
02:16:34,140 --> 02:16:36,390
Dad?

678
02:16:41,770 --> 02:16:44,400
Don't open the door!

679
02:16:44,570 --> 02:16:45,990
Sang-won!

680
02:16:46,150 --> 02:16:47,530
Don't come in!

681
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:50,200
What the hell is he saying?

682
02:16:52,660 --> 02:16:54,830
Don't open it!

683
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:58,870
It's stuck.

684
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:02,420
No! Why the hell
are the old folks here?

685
02:17:02,590 --> 02:17:04,960
- Kyung-chul!
- Mom!

686
02:17:05,130 --> 02:17:06,460
- Are you in there?
- No, Mom!

687
02:17:06,630 --> 02:17:13,850
Don't open the door!
Shit! Get away!

688
02:17:44,790 --> 02:17:47,170
Kyung-chul!
