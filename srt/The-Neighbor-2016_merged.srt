1
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,870
# Tell me all of
your thoughts #

2
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,179
# Show me what it is
to be free #

3
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:27,887
# I've been riding
on this dream #

4
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:33,158
# Flying high #

5
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,228
# Flying high #

6
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:42,301
# Flying high #

7
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:21,106
# Tell me all of
your thoughts #

8
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:28,847
# I've been riding on
this dream #

9
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,155
# Flying high #

10
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:39,224
# Flying high #

11
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:44,329
# Flying high #

12
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:48,266
# Flying high #

13
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,205
# Flying high #

14
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:55,407
# Flying high... #

15
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,540
Turn it off.

16
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:08,948
Give me the keys.

17
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,730
How bad is it?

18
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:27,032
I can make it.

19
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:29,835
I only got one more day.
I can make it.

20
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,853
Please.

21
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:49,555
Let me see it.

22
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:52,592
I went straight through,
thank God.

23
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:57,596
-You got lucky.
-This is lucky?

24
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:00,199
Yep, darling,
this is lucky.

25
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,436
It's okay, baby.

26
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,874
You may want to
bite something.

27
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:16,949
Do you know what you're doing?

28
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,786
Spent three years
in the desert, darling.

29
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:28,628
I need you to hold still.
All right?

30
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:57,656
Your plates are swapped.
You're good until Alabama.

31
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:00,092
If you get woozy,
you take a bump.

32
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,026
Not a line,
a bump.

33
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,362
Go straight down this road
and keep your lights off.

34
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:07,299
You keep 'em fucking off
until you hit the pavement.

35
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:09,868
-You understand me?
-Thank you so much.

36
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:32,294
THE NEIGHBOR
Subrip: Pix

37
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:02,120
What's he doing?

38
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:05,423
He's shooting rabbits.

39
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:07,892
What's he doing that for?

40
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:10,495
'Cause they're like squirrels,
chewing and digging everything up.

41
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:15,134
Or maybe this is
what people do around here.

42
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:20,740
What, is he like a tweaker
or something?

43
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,142
No, he's not a tweaker.

44
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:28,413
How do you know?

45
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:32,651
His aim's too good.

46
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,804
Seriously?

47
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:58,343
You're such a jerk.

48
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,680
I'm late, babe.

49
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,519
Johnny, when are you
coming back?

50
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:11,656
I don't know. It...

51
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:13,425
it shouldn't take too long.

52
00:08:25,002 --> 00:08:27,171
A few hours. I can stop
and get lunch if you want.

53
00:08:27,204 --> 00:08:29,074
No.

54
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:31,410
What is it, then?

55
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:35,514
Nothing.

56
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,163
This is temporary.

57
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:55,301
How temporary?

58
00:08:57,903 --> 00:09:01,273
A few more deliveries
and we're cool.

59
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:02,575
I get straight
with my uncle,

60
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:06,110
and then we can get
oceanside, you know?

61
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:09,581
Someplace nobody
can find us.

62
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:17,822
We're close, babe.

63
00:09:17,855 --> 00:09:19,926
We're really,
really close.

64
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:44,076
You come in late,

65
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:46,445
you come in short,

66
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:49,981
and you've brought me
a side of attitude.

67
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,388
I've been sticking
my fucking neck out for you.

68
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:58,323
I get it.

69
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:00,591
You know, I read that,

70
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:04,529
the number one reason
people give for office theft...

71
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:09,168
is "the company
owes me something."

72
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:15,441
You see that employee
right there?

73
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,309
My nephew.

74
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:22,280
He knows
how to do his job.

75
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:24,882
He keeps it clean.

76
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:29,188
And he knows that
I don't owe nobody jack shit.

77
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,191
That's why he's gonna
grow old and fat.

78
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:36,228
And you,
I don't know about you.

79
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:40,633
Guille, get this jackass outta
here before I lose my temper.

80
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:47,173
Sorry to keep ya.

81
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:51,375
Training day.

82
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:54,312
-Big delivery today, John.
-Yeah?

83
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,248
What should I expect?

84
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,218
100. Not a penny less.

85
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:02,987
-100.
-Light me a goddamn cigarette.

86
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,524
Go on, Guille.

87
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:07,893
How's things
out at the ranch?

88
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,828
Rosie's complaining
about the bugs a little bit,

89
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,096
but other than that,
everything's good.

90
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,532
You're doing pretty good
for yourself?

91
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:16,401
No problems, right?

92
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:19,370
So if, anything
was bothering you,

93
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:21,240
you'd tell me, right?

94
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,942
I mean, yeah,
of course.

95
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:26,278
Of course I would.
Everything's good.

96
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,118
You...

97
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,787
your daddy
was like you.

98
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,090
The devil
keep his soul.

99
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:40,158
He didn't say much,

100
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,561
but when he did,

101
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,100
He-he saved my neck

102
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:52,237
more times than I can
even think about.

103
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:55,473
I owed him, you see?

104
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:56,875
And that's why
I took you in,

105
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:59,778
taught you how to be
a man, you know?

106
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:03,115
I mean, you said you wanted
to go in the Service.

107
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:05,317
I allowed it.

108
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,618
Yeah.

109
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,787
But that's over now,
John, you know?

110
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:11,456
You've done your time.

111
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:15,360
You at home now
with family, right?

112
00:13:15,393 --> 00:13:18,230
Where you belong, no?

113
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:20,199
I know, Neil.

114
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:24,235
-Uncle Neil.
-Uncle Neil.

115
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:27,105
Yeah.

116
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:29,841
Yeah.

117
00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:24,355
Is there a problem, Officer?

118
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,892
Step out of
the vehicle.

119
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:38,937
Have an appointment
today, Johnny?

120
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,273
Make a little pickup
from your uncle?

121
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:43,908
-I'm clean.
-Bullshit.

122
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,010
You was born dirty.

123
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:50,915
You know better than to
leave it out in the open.

124
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:53,517
Maybe you're hiding it
someplace else.

125
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:56,254
Someplace I gotta look
a little harder to find.

126
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:02,126
You think I don't know
what goes on here, Johnny?

127
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,963
Your kind rots this town
from the inside out.

128
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:10,101
And I don't take no shit from
two-bit dirt rats like you.

129
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:12,303
No matter what
your tats say,

130
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:15,707
you'll always be scum
under my boots.

131
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,579
What you say to me?

132
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:22,613
I just said
you're not wrong.

133
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,586
you're clean.

134
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,123
Guess you weren't lying.

135
00:16:31,155 --> 00:16:33,157
Drive safe, Johnny.

136
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:14,726
What happened to you?

137
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:17,795
It ain't mine.

138
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,436
How's that gal
of yours?

139
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,472
She's sick.

140
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:32,110
Is she inside?

141
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:34,145
Nope.

142
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:38,317
Well, I hope
she's all right.

143
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,695
See ya in a few days.

144
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:13,519
-Hey, what happened?
-All good.

145
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:27,900
-There was a good amount.
-How much?

146
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:31,936
I think it was like
100 grand or something.

147
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,908
100 grand?

148
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,845
How much of that
do we get?

149
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,948
25.

150
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,416
Tomorrow, the white bag
goes to Neil,

151
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,186
and we get
the fuck outta here.

152
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:51,490
I knew you could do it.
I knew you could do it.

153
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:56,260
I knew we could do it.

154
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:36,268
What if we took
all of it?

155
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,803
Neil would hunt us down
and kill us.

156
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:50,048
Is he gonna kill us
if we leave?

157
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,450
Well, not fucking him over

158
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:55,519
would certainly
help him cope.

159
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,559
We could really use
the whole 100.

160
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:04,296
Yeah, we could, right?

161
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:06,664
It'd certainly
make a difference.

162
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,300
That would be greedy.

163
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,968
Greed makes people unlucky.

164
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:16,842
Yeah?

165
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,445
Hey, neighbor.

166
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:22,380
Hey, listen, I hate
to bother you so late,

167
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:24,449
but,
got a question for you.

168
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:26,050
All right.

169
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:29,788
Brought over
a couple cold ones.

170
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,522
Yeah, come on in.

171
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,660
-All right, cool, thanks.
-Have a seat over there.

172
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,729
Thank you.

173
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:49,707
-What's he want?
-I don't know.

174
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,949
-So, what's going on?
-I appreciate it.

175
00:21:57,981 --> 00:21:59,817
Yeah.

176
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,355
By any chance,
were you on my land today?

177
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:06,323
Yeah.

178
00:22:06,356 --> 00:22:08,826
Yeah, your trashcan was laying
in the middle of the road.

179
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:11,195
Just drug it back up
to your house.

180
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,298
All right.

181
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,500
Makes me feel better.

182
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:17,034
Found some tracks,
you know,

183
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:18,903
I didn't know if someone was
trying to rob me or whatever.

184
00:22:18,935 --> 00:22:21,405
Hell, you can't tell
about people in these parts.

185
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:23,708
Nope, that was just me.

186
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,447
You gonna keep peekin' around that
corner or you gonna come out?

187
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:39,057
-Good to meet you.
-How you doin'?

188
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:41,058
I'm Rosie.

189
00:22:44,694 --> 00:22:48,165
We don't get too many women
good-looking as you around these parts.

190
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:55,973
Y'all married?

191
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:00,778
Yeah.

192
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,982
All right.

193
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:10,020
Just wondering who you was.

194
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:15,993
I'm Rosie.

195
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,130
Night, baby.

196
00:23:22,232 --> 00:23:24,235
Yeah, I got me
one of those.

197
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,540
Yeah, they're pretty good
for looking at the stars.

198
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,676
I use mine for
looking at my neighbors.

199
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:40,018
I'm just screwing with you,
John boy, come on.

200
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,556
No, but I do watch
that road out front.

201
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:47,392
See some pretty
interesting things.

202
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:53,531
Sometimes a car will come in
light with one pair of plates.

203
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:57,434
Hour later,

204
00:23:57,468 --> 00:23:59,871
goes out heavy
with another pair of plates.

205
00:24:01,137 --> 00:24:03,140
Ain't that weird?

206
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:07,412
We all got our secrets.

207
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:09,681
I ain't no hypocrite.

208
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:13,217
You do what you do,
I do what I do.

209
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:16,453
That's why we live
out in these parts.

210
00:24:16,487 --> 00:24:18,423
Don't want to be
bothered by others.

211
00:24:20,156 --> 00:24:21,592
Well, I better be
headin' on back.

212
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:25,062
My boys gonna be
gettin' home at any second.

213
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,432
Hey, come on by sometime.

214
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:30,033
I owe you
for a cold one.

215
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:32,069
Nighty night,
neighbor.

216
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:56,314
Stop being nosey, babe.

217
00:26:56,346 --> 00:26:59,317
And pack your bags, we gotta go
as soon as I get back, all right?

218
00:27:11,127 --> 00:27:14,298
Are you sure you're
ready for this?

219
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,332
Yeah.

220
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:20,038
Yeah?
Leaving everyone?

221
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,872
Friends and family
and everyone?

222
00:27:21,905 --> 00:27:23,907
We don't have
any friends.

223
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:35,920
This...

224
00:27:56,807 --> 00:28:00,344
I'll see ya, babe.

225
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Should just buy
everything new.

226
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

227
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:56,326
-Hey, any bumps on the road?
-Nope. All good.

228
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,264
All right.

229
00:30:02,232 --> 00:30:04,501
Here you go.

230
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:06,336
Try this.

231
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:08,772
I'm not that hungry...

232
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:10,808
I didn't ask you
if you were hungry.

233
00:30:13,443 --> 00:30:15,913
-Where you going, John?
-I'm not going anywhere.

234
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:18,815
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-This is a small town, boy.

235
00:30:18,848 --> 00:30:20,483
There's no secrets
I don't hear.

236
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:22,353
I don't know what you're
listening to, but it's bullshit.

237
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:24,454
-Bullshit?
-Why would I fuck you over?

238
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:26,490
You're the only family I got.

239
00:30:29,393 --> 00:30:31,796
You are right
for Hallmark, boy.

240
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:38,836
I hear everything.
Everything.

241
00:30:38,868 --> 00:30:41,872
Sometimes I hear things
I don't like.

242
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:43,974
Now, I rely on
a lot of people.

243
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,478
Most especially you.

244
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,048
I can't afford for there
to be any dissension.

245
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:53,517
You understand?

246
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:56,553
Even if we are family...

247
00:31:15,571 --> 00:31:17,407
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

248
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:20,010
Pick up the phone!

249
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,599
At the tone,
please record your message.

250
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:43,433
When you finish recording,
you may hang up...

251
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,448
Rosie?

252
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:23,734
Troy!

253
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:37,213
You didn't happen to see, Rosie come
by here in last hour or so, did you?

254
00:33:37,247 --> 00:33:38,682
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I did.

255
00:33:38,714 --> 00:33:39,983
Caused quite a dust storm.

256
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:41,818
Seemed she was in a big
old hurry to get somewhere.

257
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:46,923
Yeah, see that?

258
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:48,492
That's why I don't
mess with 'em.

259
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:50,761
What's that?

260
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:52,129
Pretty girls.

261
00:33:52,162 --> 00:33:54,432
Will break your heart
every time.

262
00:37:13,262 --> 00:37:15,266
Troy?

263
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,003
Got those beers.

264
00:39:13,048 --> 00:39:15,552
You motherfucker.

265
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,691
# Everybody loves,
everybody loves #

266
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:31,695
# Everybody making love... #

267
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:24,840
# Everybody making love #

268
00:42:24,873 --> 00:42:29,111
# Everybody
making love #

269
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:38,788
# Everybody making love #

270
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,157
# Everybody... #

271
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:26,062
Fuck.

272
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,530
Hey.

273
00:44:32,802 --> 00:44:34,805
Kid, you better get up.

274
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:38,574
Fuck.

275
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:55,792
-You're not one of them?
-I'm not one of them.

276
00:44:55,824 --> 00:44:58,327
-You have to help me get out.
-I'm gonna help you.

277
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,230
Your last name,
what's your name?

278
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:01,931
-I'm Sarah.
-Sarah?

279
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,467
-Please.
-They're not gonna hurt you.

280
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,936
They took my friend Cole.
You have to help me find him.

281
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,971
I know, I know.
I just saw him next door.

282
00:45:08,003 --> 00:45:09,839
No, that's not him.

283
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,675
You have to find him.
You have to help him.

284
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,309
-Please.
-I'm going to.

285
00:45:13,342 --> 00:45:14,877
I just need you to
stay quiet, all right?

286
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:16,746
People don't
make it out of here.

287
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,149
-Girl, you gotta be quiet, all right?
-Okay.

288
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:21,150
I'll be back.

289
00:45:32,027 --> 00:45:34,230
Shit!

290
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:37,334
John! Holy shit.
John, he's fucking crazy.

291
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,169
-John...
-Slow down.

292
00:45:39,202 --> 00:45:41,438
-Help me, John, help me.
-Slow it down, slow it down, slow down.

293
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:43,840
John, help me.

294
00:45:43,873 --> 00:45:47,376
Get me out of here,
please!

295
00:45:47,409 --> 00:45:48,478
Please.

296
00:45:53,882 --> 00:45:55,751
This lock, babe,
I need bolt cutters.

297
00:45:55,784 --> 00:45:58,020
No, no, you don't.
No, just break it off!

298
00:45:58,054 --> 00:46:00,157
Just break it
the fuck off!

299
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,126
-Get me out of here, John, please!
-Stop!

300
00:46:09,865 --> 00:46:11,400
Fuck.

301
00:46:15,938 --> 00:46:17,406
-Fuck.
-It's him.

302
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,742
It's him.
He's back.

303
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:20,309
Fuck.
He's back.

304
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,222
Fuck. John...

305
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:35,925
I can take him.

306
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:38,027
I'll stop this.

307
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:40,197
I can take him.

308
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,532
-Okay.
-He doesn't know that I'm here.

309
00:46:42,565 --> 00:46:45,135
-He's by himself.
-John...

310
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:47,336
-One blow and he's done.
-Johnny...

311
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,441
-I'll be back before you know it.
-Okay.

312
00:46:51,474 --> 00:46:53,043
John...

313
00:47:59,007 --> 00:48:01,010
<i>side of the road.</i>

314
00:48:06,215 --> 00:48:08,518
<i>Sir, put your hands
on your head.</i>

315
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,386
<i>You. - What are you
doing this evening?</i>

316
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,322
<i>-I know my rights.
-What are you doing out here?</i>

317
00:48:13,356 --> 00:48:16,459
<i>-show you my.
-Put your hands on your head, sir.</i>

318
00:48:16,492 --> 00:48:18,995
<i>Hey, put your...
Down on the ground.</i>

319
00:48:19,027 --> 00:48:20,996
<i>Down the ground, sir!
Hey! Hey!</i>

320
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,170
<i>Sir, down on the ground.</i>

321
00:48:27,202 --> 00:48:29,072
<i>-Down on the ground, sir.
-, I know my rights.</i>

322
00:48:29,105 --> 00:48:31,007
<i>-Down on the ground, sir.
-I know my rights.</i>

323
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:33,208
<i>-Down on the ground.
-Take me home.</i>

324
00:48:33,242 --> 00:48:35,644
<i>There you go, sir.
Thank you very much.</i>

325
00:48:38,114 --> 00:48:40,215
<i>Hey, hey! Why you...
Why you messing with me?</i>

326
00:48:40,248 --> 00:48:43,953
<i>Get off of me.
Come on, man!</i>

327
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:46,456
About damn time.

328
00:48:52,094 --> 00:48:55,531
Well, which one of you dumbshits
forgot how to tie a slipknot?

329
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,934
It's nice to see you,
too, Daddy.

330
00:48:57,967 --> 00:49:00,403
-You got any aspirin?
-Aspirin?

331
00:49:00,436 --> 00:49:03,306
I'm the one
who needs aspirin.

332
00:49:03,338 --> 00:49:06,076
I had that kid's dad
on the hook for 50K.

333
00:49:06,108 --> 00:49:08,110
Now we ain't got shit.

334
00:49:08,143 --> 00:49:09,945
Well, you know,
you didn't have to kill him.

335
00:49:09,978 --> 00:49:13,282
-He saw my face.
-What'd you expect me to do?

336
00:49:13,315 --> 00:49:16,118
I'm sorry, okay?

337
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:18,054
What do you want from me?

338
00:49:18,086 --> 00:49:21,056
You're gonna dig the damn hole.
Alone.

339
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:25,662
Hell, like I've never dug
a goddamn hole before.

340
00:49:25,695 --> 00:49:28,832
Cooper,
you all right?

341
00:49:28,864 --> 00:49:32,401
Yeah.
Just allergies.

342
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,105
It's not allergies.

343
00:49:35,137 --> 00:49:36,873
Harley, give us a sec,
would you?

344
00:49:39,474 --> 00:49:41,310
God damn it.

345
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:46,182
Cooper...

346
00:49:47,483 --> 00:49:49,586
it's okay to be scared.

347
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:53,088
When your mom died,
I was scared.

348
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:55,125
I didn't know how
we was gonna survive.

349
00:49:56,324 --> 00:49:58,427
But we made it work,
didn't we?

350
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,129
We found a way.

351
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,465
Now, can it get ugly?
Yeah.

352
00:50:03,498 --> 00:50:06,101
Did we ever mean to hurt
these people? No.

353
00:50:06,135 --> 00:50:08,338
Hell no.

354
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:11,740
We was just tryin' to get a few bucks
from people who already got plenty.

355
00:50:11,773 --> 00:50:14,376
And then we was gonna
give 'em back.

356
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:16,545
You gotta know that, boy.

357
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,951
Today,
something went wrong.

358
00:50:22,385 --> 00:50:25,222
We just doing our best
to make it right and move on.

359
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:30,993
Tonight,
I'm gonna need you

360
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:33,697
to do everything I tell you,
no matter what happens.

361
00:50:35,063 --> 00:50:37,232
Because tonight,

362
00:50:37,266 --> 00:50:41,271
we are gonna get everything
we need to survive.

363
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:44,007
And then we ain't
gonna be scared no more.

364
00:50:46,108 --> 00:50:50,112
You go get your brother and go
downstairs and I'll show you, okay?

365
00:50:50,146 --> 00:50:52,015
-Okay.
-I love you, son.

366
00:51:31,753 --> 00:51:34,690
All right, boys, we got
something special tonight.

367
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:37,961
That little girl's dad is
in real estate development.

368
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,130
He's worth about
five mill.

369
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:43,565
But the mom,
she's loaded.

370
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,702
I figure her inheritance
is worth about 35.

371
00:51:46,735 --> 00:51:50,072
Which means
little blondie in there

372
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:53,209
oughta fetch about
high six figures.

373
00:51:53,242 --> 00:51:57,080
Boys, we do this right,

374
00:51:57,112 --> 00:51:59,548
we are set.

375
00:51:59,581 --> 00:52:01,317
Well, hell,
let's just ask for seven.

376
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:03,385
No, no.

377
00:52:03,418 --> 00:52:05,654
We play by the rules

378
00:52:05,688 --> 00:52:08,124
just enough till they know
we're serious,

379
00:52:08,157 --> 00:52:11,161
but not too much that
they're gonna go call the cops.

380
00:52:11,193 --> 00:52:13,128
All right?

381
00:52:13,161 --> 00:52:15,164
Let's get to work.

382
00:52:28,844 --> 00:52:32,248
-Which one's yours, bud?
-Don't matter, either one.

383
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,116
Well, it kinda
does matter.

384
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,286
I don't want
your fucking sickness.

385
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:38,355
Allergies,
asshole.

386
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,362
All right, Cooper.

387
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,599
Now, listen to me.

388
00:52:49,632 --> 00:52:52,335
When you pick up this hammer,

389
00:52:52,367 --> 00:52:54,269
you pick it up real,

390
00:52:54,302 --> 00:52:56,438
real slow.

391
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:00,177
It's not about what
you're gonna do with it.

392
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:03,445
It's what they think
you're gonna do with it.

393
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:08,952
-Yes, Dad.
-All right.

394
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,554
Let the camera
do the rest of it.

395
00:53:11,586 --> 00:53:13,623
All right,
let's go get her.

396
00:53:30,972 --> 00:53:32,909
Please stop.

397
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,952
Please don't hurt me.

398
00:53:43,985 --> 00:53:46,255
P... please don't...

399
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,597
Please. No.

400
00:54:09,311 --> 00:54:12,147
<i>This is your proof of life.</i>

401
00:54:38,974 --> 00:54:41,144
<i>As you can see,</i>

402
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:44,014
<i>your daughter
has not been harmed.</i>

403
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:49,952
<i>Yet...</i>

404
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:04,067
<i>If you do not do
as you're instructed...</i>

405
00:55:05,867 --> 00:55:10,306
<i>you will never see her
alive again.</i>

406
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:34,564
Hey.

407
00:55:36,532 --> 00:55:38,768
You did good, boy.

408
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,804
You did real good.

409
00:55:45,106 --> 00:55:46,842
We done?

410
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,312
Don't it look like it?

411
00:55:49,344 --> 00:55:52,180
What about
the other girl?

412
00:55:52,213 --> 00:55:53,615
She ain't worth nothin'.

413
00:55:53,648 --> 00:55:54,951
We're gonna have to
get rid of her.

414
00:55:54,983 --> 00:55:57,119
Why not just ransom
her back to that guy?

415
00:55:57,152 --> 00:55:59,721
She's seen too much, son.

416
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:00,990
Just ask John.

417
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,726
Hell, he's some
lowlife trafficker.

418
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:07,496
Can't pay if you don't
need the problems.

419
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,800
Right? We're just
taking out the trash.

420
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:12,836
Doing the world
a favor.

421
00:56:14,436 --> 00:56:16,572
What we gotta do is keep
our eye on that prize.

422
00:56:16,605 --> 00:56:19,641
Okay?
All right, attaboy.

423
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:35,758
-God, John.
-It's all right.

424
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:37,760
You've gotta keep quiet.
There's three now.

425
00:56:37,793 --> 00:56:39,028
-Okay.
-There's three people here.

426
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:40,997
I saw the other kids
in the rooms.

427
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,965
-I'm going back to our house.
-God.

428
00:56:42,998 --> 00:56:45,735
I'm gonna get the bolt cutters
and I'm gonna get my gun.

429
00:56:45,768 --> 00:56:47,403
-This is gonna get really bad...
-Okay.

430
00:56:47,436 --> 00:56:48,838
-really quickly.
-Yeah.

431
00:56:48,871 --> 00:56:50,673
-I'm not gonna let them hurt you.
-Okay.

432
00:56:50,706 --> 00:56:52,942
-I'm not gonna let them hurt you.
-Yeah.

433
00:56:52,974 --> 00:56:54,844
Okay, okay.

434
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:56,378
Okay, okay.

435
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Please don't.

436
00:59:00,302 --> 00:59:01,905
Dad, help!

437
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:05,608
Dad!

438
00:59:17,686 --> 00:59:19,956
Dad!

439
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:21,757
Help!

440
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,929
Eat that shit!

441
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:28,730
Fucker!

442
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:57,760
Where's the fucking gun?

443
00:59:57,793 --> 00:59:59,695
Fuck.

444
01:00:20,715 --> 01:00:22,719
Fuck.

445
01:00:27,789 --> 01:00:30,492
Hey, where the hell
is your brother?

446
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,862
You know Cooper.

447
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:37,333
Goddamn shame
we can't keep her, Dad.

448
01:00:37,365 --> 01:00:40,869
Yeah, she's a pretty
little thing, ain't she?

449
01:00:40,902 --> 01:00:41,937
Yeah.

450
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,846
Now, remember,
you said I have dibs.

451
01:00:50,878 --> 01:00:53,114
You do.

452
01:00:53,148 --> 01:00:55,251
Do me a favor, though.

453
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:57,720
Don't tear her up too bad.

454
01:00:57,753 --> 01:01:01,289
I'm thinking I might like
a poke at this little one.

455
01:01:01,322 --> 01:01:03,826
Bet you'd enjoy that,
wouldn't you, princess?

456
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,731
Sweet.

457
01:01:08,764 --> 01:01:11,733
Dress her up.
Something nice.

458
01:01:16,405 --> 01:01:18,274
Don't mind him.

459
01:01:27,815 --> 01:01:29,718
No! No!

460
01:01:29,751 --> 01:01:31,286
Please!

461
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,722
Shut the fuck up!

462
01:01:33,755 --> 01:01:35,790
I'm here to help you.

463
01:01:35,824 --> 01:01:39,994
I found your friend Sarah, and
I've got a girl upstairs, okay?

464
01:01:40,027 --> 01:01:43,431
-I need your help.
-I'm sorry, I can't walk or run.

465
01:01:43,465 --> 01:01:45,800
I tried to run.
I'm sorry.

466
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:48,837
I can't walk. No, wait!
Where are you going?!

467
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:52,407
-No, don't leave me!
-Shut up.

468
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,810
I'm gonna cut this chain.
I do not want you to move.

469
01:01:55,844 --> 01:01:57,280
I am not gonna leave you.

470
01:02:02,717 --> 01:02:04,385
Please tell me that
you can move on your own.

471
01:02:04,418 --> 01:02:05,788
-Yeah, I'm okay, I can move.
-Yeah?

472
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:07,322
All right, listen.
I found your friend.

473
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:08,858
He's down the hall.

474
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,726
He's hurt pretty badly
and he can't move on his own.

475
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,930
I need you to
dial in right now.

476
01:02:14,963 --> 01:02:16,365
Do you understand me?

477
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:19,168
My girl is upstairs
and I need your help.

478
01:02:19,201 --> 01:02:21,536
-Can I count on you?
-Yes.

479
01:03:05,547 --> 01:03:07,483
-Can you throw?
-Yeah.

480
01:03:10,284 --> 01:03:12,253
Take this.

481
01:03:12,286 --> 01:03:14,656
I want you to throw the rock
at that house.

482
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:17,092
And hit it hard.
They're gonna come out.

483
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:19,427
So as soon as you throw that,
you take him,

484
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,397
you go to my truck
right over there, start it up,

485
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:25,768
but do not turn
the lights on, all right?

486
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,569
-You wait for me there.
-Okay.

487
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:31,407
All right, listen,
do not lose those keys.

488
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,777
Count to 100,
then throw the rock.

489
01:03:37,512 --> 01:03:39,748
Now, I got this

490
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:42,217
off an Iowa girl.

491
01:03:44,452 --> 01:03:47,590
They paid a lot of money
to get her back.

492
01:03:53,195 --> 01:03:54,997
You can tell
how much money folks got

493
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:57,266
when they get the girl
something like this.

494
01:04:02,938 --> 01:04:05,875
You know, little girls generally
don't make it on the good wall.

495
01:04:08,376 --> 01:04:09,911
No, ma'am.

496
01:04:11,179 --> 01:04:14,282
Generally,
they're too strung out.

497
01:04:14,315 --> 01:04:15,650
Too easy to get.

498
01:04:18,186 --> 01:04:20,990
But you are
a special little bird.

499
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:24,359
Unique.

500
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:27,228
Prettiest goddamn girl
I've ever seen.

501
01:04:27,262 --> 01:04:30,800
You're gonna do
just right by us.

502
01:04:33,034 --> 01:04:34,103
Please...

503
01:04:36,103 --> 01:04:39,307
I was beginning to think
you didn't speak.

504
01:04:45,112 --> 01:04:47,884
You wanna look nice and pretty
for your close-up, don't you?

505
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,052
Don't you?

506
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,526
Zip it up.
Something's going on.

507
01:05:05,032 --> 01:05:07,536
Cooper!

508
01:05:09,503 --> 01:05:11,840
Coop! Cooper!

509
01:05:13,942 --> 01:05:15,945
Come on.

510
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:24,387
Cooper!

511
01:05:32,293 --> 01:05:35,096
Cooper!

512
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:37,365
-Cooper!
-Coop!

513
01:05:39,934 --> 01:05:41,503
Dad!

514
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:00,089
He's fucking dead!

515
01:06:40,295 --> 01:06:42,664
-I will not leave!
-Come on!

516
01:06:42,697 --> 01:06:45,468
-Go! Get up!
-Keys. Come on.

517
01:07:00,081 --> 01:07:03,051
-Shit! Shit!
-Get in the truck!

518
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,853
Start the fucking truck!

519
01:07:04,885 --> 01:07:07,221
Shit! Hold on.

520
01:07:07,255 --> 01:07:09,425
-Where you going, John?
-It's not what you think.

521
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,527
-They got guns.
-What?

522
01:07:11,559 --> 01:07:13,962
They're coming with guns!

523
01:07:30,177 --> 01:07:32,181
Here.

524
01:07:37,052 --> 01:07:38,754
Get in the car! Get in the car!
Guille!

525
01:07:38,786 --> 01:07:40,989
-Guille!
-He's dead. Go! Get in the car!

526
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:45,793
-My God!
-Get in the car!

527
01:07:45,827 --> 01:07:48,330
Come on!

528
01:07:50,264 --> 01:07:51,500
Go, go, go, go!

529
01:07:54,135 --> 01:07:56,237
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

530
01:07:56,271 --> 01:07:58,539
Go, go, go!

531
01:07:58,572 --> 01:08:01,242
Keep your heads down.
Heads down!

532
01:08:01,275 --> 01:08:03,678
Ain't nobody gonna take me!

533
01:08:05,045 --> 01:08:07,014
Come on, motherfuckers!

534
01:08:07,047 --> 01:08:09,050
Shit!

535
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:12,454
John, I'm gonna need you...

536
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:27,328
-Fuck!
-Don't fucking move!

537
01:09:30,231 --> 01:09:33,335
-John!
-Rosie!

538
01:09:48,582 --> 01:09:50,952
# Take my heart #

539
01:09:50,985 --> 01:09:54,288
# Precious love #

540
01:09:54,322 --> 01:09:57,226
# Guide my hand... #

541
01:10:05,899 --> 01:10:08,804
That motherfucker!

542
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,672
Fuck!

543
01:10:10,704 --> 01:10:12,908
Fucker!

544
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,677
I knew you
were trouble, Johnny.

545
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:19,914
The Service puts a certain
moral code in you.

546
01:10:19,948 --> 01:10:23,885
Just like it puts
a certain moral code in me.

547
01:10:23,917 --> 01:10:26,153
You know,
I just wanted to kill you.

548
01:10:26,186 --> 01:10:28,990
This is ugly country.

549
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:32,194
People do ugly things.

550
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:39,467
Ain't it like that
sometimes?

551
01:10:41,536 --> 01:10:43,404
Get the fuck up!

552
01:10:43,438 --> 01:10:45,975
You understand what
it means to take a life.

553
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:51,947
They don't understand
what it means to give it.

554
01:10:51,979 --> 01:10:53,848
Fuck you!

555
01:10:53,881 --> 01:10:55,617
God damn it!

556
01:10:59,554 --> 01:11:01,690
This is old country, Johnny.

557
01:11:10,664 --> 01:11:12,667
No place for weakness.

558
01:11:17,404 --> 01:11:18,974
Motherfuckers.

559
01:11:19,006 --> 01:11:22,009
Cooper didn't do shit to you.

560
01:11:22,042 --> 01:11:24,612
You fucking murderers!

561
01:11:24,645 --> 01:11:27,282
Takes someone like me
to see that.

562
01:11:27,314 --> 01:11:30,885
To see that some people ain't even
meant to be born in the first place.

563
01:11:33,988 --> 01:11:37,025
# Woe to those #

564
01:11:37,057 --> 01:11:39,860
# Who embark #

565
01:11:39,894 --> 01:11:45,367
# Then to take us apart #

566
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:48,269
# I call upon #

567
01:11:48,302 --> 01:11:51,038
# The Lord #

568
01:11:51,072 --> 01:11:55,543
# Whom I serve... #

569
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:58,347
Fuck.

570
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,382
No, don't you fucking die!

571
01:12:00,414 --> 01:12:03,185
Don't you fucking die!
You don't get to fucking die!

572
01:12:10,692 --> 01:12:13,595
# Take my heart #

573
01:12:13,627 --> 01:12:17,098
# Hold my hand #

574
01:12:17,131 --> 01:12:18,699
Let me the fuck outta here!

575
01:12:18,733 --> 01:12:21,703
# Take my heart #

576
01:12:21,735 --> 01:12:24,573
# Precious love #

577
01:12:24,605 --> 01:12:27,641
# Guide my hand #

578
01:12:27,675 --> 01:12:30,078
# From above #

579
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:32,314
# Keep me safe... #

580
01:12:32,346 --> 01:12:35,550
No. Fuck you!

581
01:12:35,582 --> 01:12:37,618
No, no, no.
Fuck you!

582
01:12:37,652 --> 01:12:39,554
Fuck!

583
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:41,590
Fuck!

584
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:50,432
# Guide my soul #

585
01:12:50,465 --> 01:12:53,001
# Guard my heart #

586
01:12:53,033 --> 01:12:55,336
# Precious love... #

587
01:12:55,369 --> 01:12:57,838
Am I pretty now,
motherfucker?!

588
01:12:57,872 --> 01:13:00,008
Prettiest thing you ever saw?!

589
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:07,115
You know, it's always the ones that
look nice with the sick minds.

590
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:11,753
# Precious love #

591
01:13:11,786 --> 01:13:14,655
# Take my heart... #

592
01:13:14,689 --> 01:13:17,359
Don't move.
Don't move!

593
01:13:17,391 --> 01:13:18,859
You're sadistic.

594
01:13:18,893 --> 01:13:21,395
Hit her again! Do it!

595
01:13:21,429 --> 01:13:23,597
Let us go
or I'll fucking shoot you!

596
01:13:23,631 --> 01:13:25,634
Do it here! Do it!

597
01:13:33,173 --> 01:13:35,777
Let's go, baby.

598
01:13:37,578 --> 01:13:39,413
Do not...

599
01:13:39,447 --> 01:13:41,082
point...

600
01:13:41,114 --> 01:13:44,385
a gun if you don't know
what the hell you're doing!

601
01:13:50,457 --> 01:13:52,460
-Let her go!
-Hey!

602
01:14:17,484 --> 01:14:19,387
He's locked us in.

603
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:22,891
What?

604
01:14:30,765 --> 01:14:31,900
-Move back.
-Come on, come on.

605
01:14:31,932 --> 01:14:33,935
Back! Back!

606
01:14:33,967 --> 01:14:35,737
John!

607
01:14:41,876 --> 01:14:43,177
He's coming back
up the stairs.

608
01:14:43,211 --> 01:14:45,079
Get her down there.
Get her down the fucking hole!

609
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:47,516
-Go!
-Come on.

610
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:21,483
Okay. Okay.

611
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:28,422
Fuck!

612
01:16:31,752 --> 01:16:34,622
You think this ends
with me?

613
01:16:34,655 --> 01:16:37,225
I'm just a middleman.

614
01:16:39,493 --> 01:16:42,964
Just like you, John.

615
01:16:48,301 --> 01:16:49,304
That's right.

616
01:16:50,738 --> 01:16:52,874
That's right.

617
01:16:52,907 --> 01:16:55,076
They all know
who you are.

618
01:16:55,109 --> 01:16:57,078
And they're coming.

619
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:59,648
Nobody gets away.

620
01:17:02,984 --> 01:17:06,054
Now, why don't you to be
a good little soldier,

621
01:17:06,087 --> 01:17:08,323
John boy,

622
01:17:08,355 --> 01:17:10,524
and put the fucking
gun do...

623
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,983
# Blessed above #

624
01:19:50,016 --> 01:19:53,153
# May I see #

625
01:19:53,186 --> 01:19:55,823
# Our work done #

626
01:19:55,856 --> 01:19:58,827
# Let it be #

627
01:19:58,859 --> 01:20:01,228
# Precious love #

628
01:20:01,261 --> 01:20:04,097
# Take my heart #

629
01:20:04,131 --> 01:20:06,802
# Hold my hand #

630
01:20:09,837 --> 01:20:12,874
# Take my heart #

631
01:20:12,907 --> 01:20:15,310
# Precious love #

632
01:20:15,342 --> 01:20:18,179
# Guide my hand #

633
01:20:18,212 --> 01:20:20,882
# From above #

634
01:20:20,914 --> 01:20:23,784
# Keep me safe #

635
01:20:23,818 --> 01:20:26,554
# In the light #

636
01:20:26,587 --> 01:20:29,524
# Of the Lord #

637
01:20:30,591 --> 01:20:33,027
# Precious love #

638
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,797
# Take my heart #

639
01:20:35,829 --> 01:20:38,131
# Hold my hand #
