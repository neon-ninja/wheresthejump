1
00:00:02,406 --> 00:00:03,640
(whooshing)

2
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:15,619
(light, enigmatic music)

3
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:36,140
(car rumbling)

4
00:01:21,652 --> 00:01:23,320
(thudding)

5
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:32,429
What do you think?

6
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,708
You must be Richard.

7
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:46,143
I'm Luke.

8
00:01:46,177 --> 00:01:47,411
This is my wife Jennifer,
sorry we kept you.

9
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:49,546
Three bedrooms,
one and a half baths

10
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,382
She's old,

11
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:53,250
but she's got good bones.

12
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:57,521
When was it built?

13
00:01:57,554 --> 00:01:59,723
Come one inside and
take a look around.

14
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:02,125
You let me know if you find
any problems or whatnot.

15
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,745
Good bones, huh?

16
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,249
Comes with the furniture?

17
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:27,451
Yeah.

18
00:02:27,484 --> 00:02:29,953
I guess, Richard got
the house on auction.

19
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:31,555
Hmm.

20
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:32,756
[Luke] He's been
meaning to fix it up a bit

21
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,593
but hasn't gotten
around to it yet, so.

22
00:02:36,627 --> 00:02:37,894
He did like this.

23
00:02:41,798 --> 00:02:43,900
He's giving us a
really nice deal.

24
00:02:45,836 --> 00:02:47,238
Great.

25
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:52,909
Hey.

26
00:02:53,977 --> 00:02:56,313
Give it a chance, huh?

27
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:58,549
I think this could be fun.

28
00:02:58,582 --> 00:02:59,916
Playing house for a few months.

29
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:10,193
I'll go get rid of,
Mr. Personality.

30
00:03:18,602 --> 00:03:20,203
A few months.

31
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,980
(click)

32
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:41,485
I haven't lived in a
house since I left.

33
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:43,454
And our apartment,

34
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:45,622
I think it'd fit in
within these two rooms.

35
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:48,925
It's a lot of house.

36
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,628
It's a lot to get used to.

37
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,932
It's only for now.

38
00:04:57,534 --> 00:04:59,970
And I think this is gonna
be really good for us.

39
00:05:02,573 --> 00:05:04,475
And once things
have settled down,

40
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:07,844
Chicago will still be there.

41
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:10,947
Promise?

42
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:12,416
Promise.

43
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:18,021
It's a nice house.

44
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:28,365
(gasping, rustling)

45
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:33,103
(knocking)

46
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:47,050
(click)

47
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,018
Hello.

48
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:48,785
[Luke] Meredith?

49
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:50,053
Mom.

50
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:51,988
Oh, well you just
look at this house.

51
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:54,891
It is so good to
have you back, Jenny.

52
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:57,127
You have no idea how
much I've missed you.

53
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,962
And you, Luke.

54
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:00,130
Handsome as ever.

55
00:06:00,163 --> 00:06:02,866
Oh, welcome home, welcome.

56
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:06,570
Oh, and I've brought you a
little house warming gift

57
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:07,804
for the nursery.

58
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:09,873
And, some wraps from
over at Larry's Place.

59
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:10,941
I figured you must be starving.

60
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:12,709
We just ordered a pizza.

61
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:13,910
So.

62
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:15,646
Well, how was I
suppose to know that?

63
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,113
Could've called,
that would've worked.

64
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:18,715
Honey, it's okay, I'll
just put them in the fridge.

65
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:20,016
Meredith, thank you,
it was very thoughtful.

66
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,818
Well I figured you
must be starving.

67
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:23,153
No, really we are, here.

68
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:23,954
Come in.

69
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:25,422
Excuse me, dear.

70
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:26,857
Oh.

71
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:30,627
(chuckling)

72
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:32,529
I see you just
started to unpack.

73
00:06:32,563 --> 00:06:34,431
We got here this afternoon.

74
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:37,067
I know, I know, just saying.

75
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,470
You have an awfully long
way to go, don't you?

76
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:40,804
Yes.

77
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:43,674
It's not so bad.

78
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:45,175
I was telling Jennifer
earlier, how exciting.

79
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,111
Yes, it's terribly,
terribly exciting.

80
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:49,946
Well.

81
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:52,716
Certainly is big enough.

82
00:06:57,253 --> 00:06:59,490
I'm gonna go put
these in the kitchen.

83
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:01,124
Meredith, maybe you wanna
take a look around upstairs?

84
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:02,225
Sounds lovely.

85
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:04,160
Yes.

86
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:06,129
Jenny, coming?

87
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:20,210
Luke seems to be in high
spirits, doesn't he?

88
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:27,250
And you?

89
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:29,085
How are you?

90
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,821
You don't have to
tiptoe around me, Mom.

91
00:07:30,854 --> 00:07:31,755
I'm fine.

92
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:32,756
Please don't lie, Jenny.

93
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:34,491
It doesn't suit you.

94
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,193
What do you want?

95
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:39,195
I want you to be happy.

96
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:41,197
I'm happy, things are great.

97
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:43,033
I'm glad to hear that.

98
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:45,068
After all the help
I've given you.

99
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:46,537
I don't need your help.

100
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,203
(laughing)

101
00:07:47,237 --> 00:07:48,905
I beg to differ.

102
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:49,973
Where would you be

103
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:52,142
if I hadn't convinced
Richard about this house?

104
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:54,110
And help Luke get this job?

105
00:07:54,144 --> 00:07:55,178
In Chicago.

106
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:57,147
Oh yes.

107
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,917
Raising a family on a
bartender salary alone.

108
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:02,252
Of course.

109
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:03,720
No.

110
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:06,089
I think this is going to
be best for both of you.

111
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:07,958
The three of you.

112
00:08:07,991 --> 00:08:11,261
Besides, it's about time Luke
did something with his degree.

113
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,731
And you?

114
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:15,666
Can we not do this right now?

115
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:16,600
Still haven't talked about it.

116
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:17,834
There's nothing to talk about.

117
00:08:17,868 --> 00:08:19,169
Your irrational
little episode.

118
00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:20,571
Stop, Mom.

119
00:08:20,604 --> 00:08:21,772
You know, I wasn't
exactly thrilled

120
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:24,140
when I found out I
was pregnant with you.

121
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:26,677
But I managed to keep
it together, didn't I?

122
00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:29,045
You should leave.

123
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,014
I didn't act like
a spoiled child.

124
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:32,816
What you did was irresponsible.

125
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:34,017
Embarrassing, really.

126
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,285
Get out.

127
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:43,660
Of course.

128
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,228
It's none of my business.

129
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:55,105
I'm just so glad
everything's alright.

130
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,878
It's a lovely house.

131
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:13,189
Leaving already?

132
00:09:13,223 --> 00:09:14,224
I should be going.

133
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:16,159
Let you two finish unpacking.

134
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:17,894
Goodnight, Luke.

135
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:19,195
Thanks for the wraps.

136
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:20,897
It was nice to see you.

137
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:23,166
Jenny.

138
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,701
Bye Mom.

139
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,903
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

140
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:28,939
I'm going to be throwing
a house warming party

141
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:30,273
for you here this weekend.

142
00:09:30,306 --> 00:09:32,643
I've invited all of
my friends, of course

143
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:33,777
and some of yours.

144
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,978
What?

145
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:36,046
I'm going to make
a few appetizers

146
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,313
and dips and the like.

147
00:09:37,347 --> 00:09:39,282
But you should probably put a
few things together yourself.

148
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:40,717
We can't have a party.

149
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:41,852
Oh and

150
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:44,755
make sure you've
finished unpacking, hmm?

151
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:47,023
I don't want anyone to get
a bad first impression.

152
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:51,327
(thud)

153
00:09:52,963 --> 00:09:54,130
[Voiceover] She
made you curtains?

154
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:55,331
Yes.

155
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:57,400
[Voiceover] Oh
god, what a delight.

156
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,335
With elephants
and zebras on them.

157
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:01,838
[Voiceover] She made
you jungle curtains.

158
00:10:01,872 --> 00:10:03,674
She made me jungle curtains.

159
00:10:03,707 --> 00:10:05,842
[Voiceover] Oh
I just, I can't.

160
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:06,977
You have to put them up.

161
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:07,778
(laughing)

162
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:09,279
Absolutely not.

163
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:11,147
[Voiceover] Oh come
one, you're being no fun.

164
00:10:11,181 --> 00:10:13,083
No, I already
explained to Luke.

165
00:10:13,116 --> 00:10:15,185
Putting them up would
seem too permanent.

166
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:17,253
Next thing you know we're
painting the walls to match

167
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:18,689
and getting new carpet

168
00:10:18,722 --> 00:10:19,923
and putting the
pool in the back.

169
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:21,858
We're not gonna
be here that long.

170
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:23,259
[Voiceover] Ready to
come back already, huh?

171
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:24,127
(sighing)

172
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,295
Oh yes.

173
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:27,764
[Voiceover] You're not
enjoying it even a little bit?

174
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:29,332
My life's in Chicago, Lauren.

175
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:30,233
(thump)

176
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:31,434
You're in Chicago.

177
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:33,169
There's nothing for me here.

178
00:10:33,203 --> 00:10:35,271
[Voiceover] Yeah, I
know I want you back too.

179
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:39,209
Just stay positive,
it'll be over soon.

180
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:41,377
It's only gonna be
what you make of it.

181
00:10:41,411 --> 00:10:43,346
Yeah, yeah, I know.

182
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,683
Honey, what are these?

183
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:49,052
Oh yeah, turns
out we have rats.

184
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:50,086
Hold on.

185
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,154
We have rats?

186
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:51,988
Yeah.

187
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:53,189
Down in the crawlspace,

188
00:10:53,223 --> 00:10:54,891
I saw some droppings
this morning.

189
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,326
He says we have rats
in the crawlspace.

190
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:57,894
[Voiceover] Rats
in the crawlspace?

191
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,295
God, that's awful.

192
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:01,031
At least he didn't
find any dead bodies.

193
00:11:01,064 --> 00:11:02,232
That would be a deal breaker.

194
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:03,867
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention.

195
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,835
Shut up.

196
00:11:04,868 --> 00:11:06,102
I better go, sorry.

197
00:11:06,136 --> 00:11:07,838
[Voiceover] No, I get it.

198
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:09,940
I've a problem
with my own anyway.

199
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:11,307
Brad's been drawing
on the walls lately

200
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:14,344
and he just ran by with
a handful of markers.

201
00:11:14,377 --> 00:11:16,279
I'm afraid he's
feeling artistic again.

202
00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:17,247
(laughing)

203
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,181
You think rats are bad?

204
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:19,249
Try dealing with a toddler.

205
00:11:19,282 --> 00:11:21,117
Something to look forward to.

206
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:23,787
Come visit me?

207
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,188
[Voiceover] Done.

208
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:26,322
Miss you, love you.

209
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:27,824
Miss you, love you.

210
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:28,725
[Voiceover] Brad,
I swear you put the.

211
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,893
(beep)

212
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:37,133
(clink)

213
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:44,174
(light, enigmatic music)

214
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,829
I'm gonna go to my Mom's.

215
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:07,363
Get those things for tonight.

216
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:08,164
She's out getting her hair done

217
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:10,266
so I figured now's
the best time.

218
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:12,869
You want me to go?

219
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:15,872
No, I want to
get out the house.

220
00:12:15,906 --> 00:12:17,273
Cabin fever, huh?

221
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:19,209
I'm just starting
to feel a bit trapped.

222
00:12:19,242 --> 00:12:21,878
In less than a week and she's
already running our lives.

223
00:12:21,912 --> 00:12:23,880
Come on, it's not that bad.

224
00:12:23,914 --> 00:12:25,381
She is throwing us a party.

225
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:27,217
She's throwing
herself a party.

226
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,484
I really don't think she's.

227
00:12:28,518 --> 00:12:29,986
This isn't about us
Luke, it's about her.

228
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,521
It's always about her.

229
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:33,489
Jennifer.

230
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:35,158
Come here.

231
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:37,427
Come here.

232
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:41,264
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:42,765
I'm overreacting.

234
00:12:45,268 --> 00:12:47,403
Listen, if you go into to
it with a negative attitude

235
00:12:47,437 --> 00:12:49,272
it's going to be bad.

236
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:52,843
It's just one night.

237
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:56,012
And I'll be there with
you the whole time.

238
00:12:57,613 --> 00:12:58,982
I love you.

239
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:00,483
I love you too.

240
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:02,418
(smooch)

241
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:04,354
Want me to finish unpacking?

242
00:13:04,387 --> 00:13:05,455
No leave them.

243
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:08,024
Let her know how inconvenient
this whole thing is.

244
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:12,028
(birds chirping)

245
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:29,212
(light, sensitive music)

246
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,529
(laughing, chattering)

247
00:14:21,397 --> 00:14:22,498
That's good.

248
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:24,167
Okay.

249
00:14:31,574 --> 00:14:33,910
And so, my mother sees
me on the floor that day

250
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:34,677
and my brother's not there

251
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,346
so she picks me up, she running.

252
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:38,982
Can you imagine having
something this nice?

253
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:40,917
And let me tell you
who's delighted is Luke.

254
00:14:42,152 --> 00:14:43,519
Yikes.

255
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:45,922
(laughing)

256
00:14:45,956 --> 00:14:47,257
Fair fight, huh?

257
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,258
Fair kind of conversation
to be part of.

258
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:48,992
That's good.

259
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:50,293
That's good.

260
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:14,617
Jenny, oh my goodness, hi.

261
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,585
Hi.

262
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:17,187
How are you?

263
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,520
Look at you.

264
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:18,989
Oh.

265
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:19,589
[Burnett Woman]
You look amazing.

266
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:20,991
[Jennifer] Thank you.

267
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:21,724
[Burnett Woman] How
far along are you?

268
00:15:21,757 --> 00:15:23,459
[Jennifer] About seven months.

269
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:24,260
[Burnett Woman] When did
you get home from Chicago?

270
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:25,495
Just a few days ago.

271
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:26,462
If you'll excuse
me, I'm so sorry,

272
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:27,663
I just have to take
care of a few things.

273
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:28,331
[Woman] It's great to see you.

274
00:15:28,364 --> 00:15:29,132
You too.

275
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:29,599
She looks amazing.

276
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:30,433
[Woman] Yeah.

277
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:37,440
Excuse me.

278
00:15:37,473 --> 00:15:38,308
Oh.

279
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:39,442
(laughing)

280
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:40,243
I'm sorry.

281
00:15:40,276 --> 00:15:41,711
[Man] Sorry.

282
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:43,546
Um, I don't
believe we have met.

283
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:44,480
I'm Jenn.

284
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:45,448
You're Jennifer, right?

285
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:47,383
Yes.

286
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:48,551
I'm Walter, Walter Vance.

287
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:50,320
Very nice to meet you.

288
00:15:50,353 --> 00:15:51,521
You're a friend
of my mother's?

289
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:54,124
An old friend, yes, yes.

290
00:15:54,157 --> 00:15:56,459
I must say Jennifer, this is

291
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:58,328
quite the house you have here.

292
00:15:58,361 --> 00:16:00,063
Hmm, it's

293
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:01,397
unique.

294
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:02,498
Oh very unique.

295
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:03,666
Yes.

296
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:05,468
Yes a very

297
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:07,270
interesting energy.

298
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:10,440
Thank you.

299
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:12,842
Is there anything
I could get you?

300
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,710
I'm so very glad to hear
your baby's doing better.

301
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:19,482
It was very close, wasn't it?

302
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,252
What was it, if
I may be so bold?

303
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:24,020
Was the baby sick?

304
00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:26,122
Were you sick?

305
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:27,590
Who told you about that?

306
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:29,525
Walter?

307
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,493
(grunting)

308
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:32,595
Oh, there you are, Walter.

309
00:16:32,628 --> 00:16:34,664
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

310
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:36,132
Hello Katherine.

311
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,600
And I was just getting
to know Jennifer here.

312
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:39,602
Oh Jennifer, what'd
you think of Walter, hmm?

313
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:42,038
He's my most eccentric friend.

314
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:43,039
[Walter] Now Katherine.

315
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:44,340
No, it's true.

316
00:16:44,374 --> 00:16:46,642
Walter thinks himself
a bit of a psychic.

317
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:49,212
Or is it medium, dear?

318
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:51,047
Is that what you call yourself?

319
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:52,148
Neither, actually.

320
00:16:52,182 --> 00:16:53,749
Pay no attention to her.

321
00:16:53,783 --> 00:16:56,286
I pick up on things, that's all.

322
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,420
Energy.

323
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:59,355
But I'm a chiropractor
by profession,

324
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:00,356
just a chiropractor.

325
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,091
Just?

326
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:01,691
Don't be silly.

327
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:03,393
This man has a gift.

328
00:17:03,426 --> 00:17:05,295
Now if you'll
excuse us, Jennifer,

329
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:08,431
I have some gossip I'm
just dying to tell him.

330
00:17:08,464 --> 00:17:10,500
Very nice to
meet you Jennifer.

331
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:20,476
(chattering, laughing)

332
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,801
(dark, ominous music)

333
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,509
Let's give her
some room, okay?

334
00:17:53,543 --> 00:17:55,711
I just don't want
it brought up, okay?

335
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:56,646
Anymore.

336
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:57,580
Thank you.

337
00:17:57,613 --> 00:17:59,182
I know you'll understand.

338
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:00,683
[Luke] Isn't that
right Jennifer?

339
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:01,884
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:03,119
[Luke] I said
we're still deciding

341
00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:05,555
but we're thinking maybe Tyler.

342
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:08,258
Oh, yes, that's right.

343
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,625
Tyler.

344
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,399
[Luke] You're
being awfully quiet.

345
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:50,766
Hmm.

346
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,835
It took a lot out of me.

347
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:54,370
[Luke] What did she say?

348
00:18:54,404 --> 00:18:56,472
What didn't she say?

349
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:58,574
Oh, I'm terribly
sorry about this mess.

350
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:01,711
Terribly, terribly sorry.

351
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,216
She knows we haven't hung
up those damn curtains yet.

352
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:06,949
God.

353
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:07,883
You know we might as well.

354
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:08,818
Save us an earful, at least.

355
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:09,652
Luke.

356
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:10,853
They're not that
hideous, really.

357
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:12,822
No, I'm not putting them up.

358
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:19,629
Have you applied for
anything in Chicago?

359
00:19:19,662 --> 00:19:20,630
[Luke] It's been a week.

360
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:22,164
So, no.

361
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,802
We're going to be here at
least until the baby's born.

362
00:19:26,836 --> 00:19:28,938
That was the whole point
of this, you know that.

363
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:31,674
(sighing)

364
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:33,309
Look, I'll start looking soon

365
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:34,510
but while we're here,

366
00:19:34,544 --> 00:19:35,611
you should at least try
to give it a chance.

367
00:19:35,645 --> 00:19:36,679
I am trying.

368
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:37,613
We hosted the party.

369
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:39,815
You didn't talk to anybody.

370
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:40,950
You know, you could've made
an effort with these people.

371
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:42,785
Try to make some friends.

372
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:45,455
I like the friends I have.

373
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
(rustling)

374
00:20:24,594 --> 00:20:25,661
Whoa.

375
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:26,929
Sorry.

376
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:34,570
(clattering)

377
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:35,905
Someone's still here.

378
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:37,340
What?

379
00:20:37,373 --> 00:20:39,041
In the bathroom,
there's someone there.

380
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:40,576
Go get rid of them.

381
00:20:49,018 --> 00:20:50,720
(knocking)

382
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:01,997
(click)

383
00:21:12,975 --> 00:21:15,778
(dark, ominous music)

384
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:22,485
(crickets chirping)

385
00:21:38,968 --> 00:21:40,470
They leave?

386
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:43,072
Yeah.

387
00:21:47,943 --> 00:21:49,412
(sighing)

388
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:52,715
I'm sorry.

389
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,018
It took a lot out of me too.

390
00:21:58,854 --> 00:22:00,322
Come on.

391
00:22:20,175 --> 00:22:22,545
Late?

392
00:22:22,578 --> 00:22:23,979
[Luke] Yeah.

393
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:26,081
Forgot what it feels
like to be up this early.

394
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:30,953
Wish me luck.

395
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:31,621
Good luck.

396
00:22:31,654 --> 00:22:32,087
I love you.

397
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:33,556
Love you.

398
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:21,971
(knocking)

399
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:27,810
(birds chirping)

400
00:23:38,821 --> 00:23:40,856
(knocking)

401
00:24:42,151 --> 00:24:44,554
(thumping)

402
00:24:45,855 --> 00:24:48,257
(dark, ominous music)

403
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
(knocking)

404
00:25:05,074 --> 00:25:06,609
Yes?

405
00:25:06,642 --> 00:25:08,544
Is this a bad time?

406
00:25:08,578 --> 00:25:10,112
No.

407
00:25:10,145 --> 00:25:11,781
Can I help you?

408
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:14,750
I'm Marlene, I live next door.

409
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:17,653
Oh.

410
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:19,789
Right, I'm sorry.

411
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:21,724
I'm, Jennifer.

412
00:25:21,757 --> 00:25:24,226
I thought I'd bring you these.

413
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:26,228
Welcome to the
neighborhood, all that.

414
00:25:26,261 --> 00:25:27,597
Thank you.

415
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:29,932
It's very thoughtful.

416
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,001
You're from around here?

417
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:33,102
Chicago, actually.

418
00:25:33,135 --> 00:25:35,838
My husband, Luke and I,
we're just here for a bit.

419
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:38,908
I, grew up around here though.

420
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:40,042
Oh.

421
00:25:40,075 --> 00:25:41,543
Welcome home.

422
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,884
It's a blessing.

423
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:50,252
I'm sorry?

424
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,322
Oh.

425
00:25:53,355 --> 00:25:55,157
Thank you.

426
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:01,296
Would you like to come inside?

427
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,799
Oh no, I, I have to be going.

428
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,901
I just wanted to say hello.

429
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:09,071
Thank you for the cookies.

430
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:10,706
Nice meeting you.

431
00:26:15,244 --> 00:26:17,179
(scrunching)

432
00:26:20,215 --> 00:26:22,584
(whirring, ticking)

433
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:39,234
(groaning)

434
00:27:38,027 --> 00:27:40,295
(dark, menacing music)

435
00:27:51,106 --> 00:27:52,341
But he's one of
those newer supervisors

436
00:27:52,374 --> 00:27:53,375
anytime I asked him a question,

437
00:27:53,408 --> 00:27:54,844
he just give me the name

438
00:27:54,877 --> 00:27:56,445
of somebody else to
go talk to later on.

439
00:27:56,478 --> 00:27:57,780
I don't know, I think
he was just hired

440
00:27:57,813 --> 00:27:59,414
but he's really nice.

441
00:27:59,448 --> 00:28:00,983
You look bored to death.

442
00:28:02,084 --> 00:28:03,786
What?

443
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:06,321
No, Morgan sounds nice.

444
00:28:06,355 --> 00:28:08,057
He sounds really

445
00:28:08,924 --> 00:28:10,259
nice.

446
00:28:12,795 --> 00:28:15,798
I'm sorry, I had a weird day.

447
00:28:15,831 --> 00:28:16,465
No, no, it's boring stuff.

448
00:28:16,498 --> 00:28:18,200
No, it's not really.

449
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:20,169
I'm sure Morgan is very

450
00:28:20,202 --> 00:28:21,303
Nice.

451
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:24,473
(laughing)

452
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,142
So what's up?

453
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:33,482
Have you felt anything
off since moving here?

454
00:28:33,515 --> 00:28:35,417
In the house, I mean?

455
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,386
[Luke] Off how?

456
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:39,454
Well, today

457
00:28:39,488 --> 00:28:43,058
these boxes moved on their own.

458
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:45,861
I don't know.

459
00:28:45,895 --> 00:28:47,429
I just felt like my
head wasn't on right.

460
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,367
What?

461
00:28:52,401 --> 00:28:54,003
How long has
this been going on?

462
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:55,370
Just today.

463
00:28:59,408 --> 00:29:01,243
It's probably nothing.

464
00:29:01,276 --> 00:29:02,377
Never mind.

465
00:29:02,411 --> 00:29:03,545
Jennifer, if you're starting
to feel strange again?

466
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:05,447
It's nothing.

467
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,849
Forget I said it.

468
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:10,920
Just don't like being
here alone, that's all.

469
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:19,394
(splashing)

470
00:29:19,428 --> 00:29:21,463
(gasping)

471
00:29:39,448 --> 00:29:41,984
(chattering, laughing)

472
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,458
No.

473
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:52,061
No, no no, no.

474
00:29:53,062 --> 00:29:54,296
I don't care if you say no.

475
00:29:56,465 --> 00:29:58,033
No, no, no, do you hear me?

476
00:29:58,934 --> 00:30:00,369
No.

477
00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:02,137
No, no, no, no.

478
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:14,149
(wind rustling)

479
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:19,121
(fizzing, pattering)

480
00:30:30,966 --> 00:30:32,334
(creaking)

481
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:33,502
Luke?

482
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:37,873
Very funny.

483
00:30:43,612 --> 00:30:45,547
(dark, ominous music)

484
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,088
What're you doing?

485
00:30:59,128 --> 00:31:00,896
I'm almost done,
then it's all yours.

486
00:31:11,006 --> 00:31:12,307
Not now.

487
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:21,951
Alright that's enough.

488
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,460
I'm sorry, I

489
00:31:31,493 --> 00:31:33,528
I appreciate the
gesture, I really do.

490
00:31:33,562 --> 00:31:34,529
But.

491
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:36,498
Talking to yourself?

492
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:38,167
Thanks for keeping
the water warm for me.

493
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,301
Thanks honey.

494
00:31:56,318 --> 00:31:57,586
Luke.

495
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:00,355
[Luke] Do we have any
of that creamer left?

496
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:01,290
Luke?

497
00:32:01,323 --> 00:32:02,657
[Luke] Just a second.

498
00:32:10,632 --> 00:32:11,600
Luke.

499
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:13,235
Hmm?

500
00:32:14,303 --> 00:32:15,537
Could we talk?

501
00:32:17,472 --> 00:32:18,707
Yeah what's up?

502
00:32:22,011 --> 00:32:23,612
There's um,

503
00:32:24,613 --> 00:32:25,614
there's something.

504
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:26,748
(buzzing)

505
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:28,117
Hold that thought.

506
00:32:33,455 --> 00:32:34,523
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

507
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:36,425
(knocking, gasping)

508
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:38,360
(chuckling)

509
00:32:38,393 --> 00:32:39,561
I think you're gonna
wanna get that.

510
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:42,364
What?

511
00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:43,698
Go on, get it.

512
00:32:48,137 --> 00:32:48,737
What's going on?

513
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,305
Just open it.

514
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:54,676
Look who's in town.

515
00:32:54,709 --> 00:32:55,677
(laughing)

516
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,146
Lauren.

517
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:58,547
Oh are you
surprised to see us?

518
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,781
What're you doing here?

519
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:01,250
I was gonna wait
till you were settled

520
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:03,418
but the train is cheap
and I had nothing to do.

521
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:04,653
God, I missed you,
I really miseed you.

522
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:06,021
I can't believe you're here.

523
00:33:06,055 --> 00:33:07,122
Oh well, it was
Luke's idea really.

524
00:33:07,156 --> 00:33:08,257
I'd love to take all the credit

525
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,491
but I guess your husband's just

526
00:33:09,524 --> 00:33:11,126
a better person
than your bestie.

527
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,427
(screaming)

528
00:33:12,461 --> 00:33:14,563
Oh god it is so good to see you.

529
00:33:14,596 --> 00:33:16,431
You have no idea.

530
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:27,676
You know I've been
dying to see this place.

531
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:30,145
I love it, by the way.

532
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,248
So old, so bizarre.

533
00:33:35,484 --> 00:33:37,586
Okay, so

534
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:39,354
real talk.

535
00:33:39,388 --> 00:33:42,491
I know you're probably
tired of people asking, but

536
00:33:42,524 --> 00:33:44,459
how are you feeling?

537
00:33:46,595 --> 00:33:48,663
Can I tell you something?

538
00:33:48,697 --> 00:33:51,400
And you have to promise to
keep an open mind about it.

539
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:52,601
Yeah sure.

540
00:33:52,634 --> 00:33:53,735
What is it?

541
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:00,475
I think this house is haunted.

542
00:34:03,212 --> 00:34:04,413
What?

543
00:34:04,446 --> 00:34:05,547
I don't know for
sure, it's just

544
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,683
some weird things have been
happening recently, and

545
00:34:08,717 --> 00:34:10,485
yeah, everything
feels so strange.

546
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:13,122
Luke said you've
been feeling weird.

547
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:14,756
He told you that?

548
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:17,092
Well yeah, yeah, but I
mean he didn't mention,

549
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:18,660
he didn't say that it was.

550
00:34:18,693 --> 00:34:21,796
You think this house is haunted?

551
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,732
Tell me everything.

552
00:34:23,765 --> 00:34:25,334
Things move.

553
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:27,202
Strange noises.

554
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,639
I thought someone was in the
shower with me this morning.

555
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:32,174
No way.

556
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:33,775
And did you tell Luke
about any of this?

557
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:35,344
I tried.

558
00:34:35,377 --> 00:34:36,545
But the moment I
mentioned I felt something

559
00:34:36,578 --> 00:34:38,313
he got upset.

560
00:34:38,347 --> 00:34:40,282
And I mean I think
he thought it was

561
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:41,850
the whole baby thing.

562
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:44,253
You're sure it's not?

563
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:45,487
What?

564
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,422
[Lauren] I mean your
sure it's not stress or

565
00:34:48,757 --> 00:34:49,858
hormones?

566
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:53,128
Hormones don't open doors
and move boxes, Lauren.

567
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:57,832
Look, I get why you might

568
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,869
why you and Luke might not.

569
00:35:04,573 --> 00:35:06,875
Things got really confused
back in Chicago, right before.

570
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,844
You know, I.

571
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,815
I was feeling a lot of things

572
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:15,617
and I

573
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,455
I couldn't handle it.

574
00:35:23,558 --> 00:35:25,727
But this is something different.

575
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,762
Lauren please, you
gotta believe me.

576
00:35:27,796 --> 00:35:28,763
This is something else.

577
00:35:28,797 --> 00:35:30,232
I believe you.

578
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:34,503
Thanks.

579
00:35:35,737 --> 00:35:37,272
So

580
00:35:38,207 --> 00:35:39,808
What're you gonna do?

581
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:42,711
I don't know.

582
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:43,845
I mean, what're
you supposed to do

583
00:35:43,878 --> 00:35:45,714
when your house is haunted?

584
00:35:45,747 --> 00:35:46,781
Pull out a ouija board?

585
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:48,283
Call a medium.

586
00:35:48,317 --> 00:35:49,751
(chuckling)

587
00:35:52,754 --> 00:35:54,323
There was this
guy at our party,

588
00:35:54,356 --> 00:35:56,258
my Mom's chiropractor.

589
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,360
His friend said he was psychic.

590
00:35:59,694 --> 00:36:01,896
Your Mom knows a
psychic chiropractor?

591
00:36:03,598 --> 00:36:04,466
It's just.

592
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:05,834
(laughing)

593
00:36:05,867 --> 00:36:06,468
(child cooing)

594
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:07,702
Oh.

595
00:36:07,736 --> 00:36:09,338
Sounds like somebody's awake.

596
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:13,308
That one?

597
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:14,376
Ah hmm.

598
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:15,210
And this one.

599
00:36:15,244 --> 00:36:15,844
(clattering)

600
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:17,246
[Lauren] Oh, uh oh.

601
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:19,248
Let's take this
one off over there.

602
00:36:19,281 --> 00:36:21,450
I can't find anything
at this address.

603
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:22,984
There's an article from
the 70's about rezoning

604
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:23,918
but that's it.

605
00:36:23,952 --> 00:36:26,355
No deaths, no murders, nothing.

606
00:36:26,388 --> 00:36:27,322
[Lauren] So?

607
00:36:27,356 --> 00:36:28,723
So it doesn't make sense.

608
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:29,824
I mean someone had to die here

609
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:30,959
for there to be ghost, right?

610
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:33,828
I don't think ghosts have
rules, Jennifer, I mean.

611
00:36:33,862 --> 00:36:34,863
You're thinking too small,

612
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:36,531
what if

613
00:36:36,565 --> 00:36:38,933
what if your house is
cursed or it's a poltergeist

614
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:40,702
or a demon?

615
00:36:40,735 --> 00:36:42,571
Great.

616
00:36:42,604 --> 00:36:44,839
I have an idea of
something that we can try.

617
00:36:44,873 --> 00:36:47,576
But we'll have to wait till
tonight when Brad's in bed.

618
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:48,843
What is it?

619
00:36:48,877 --> 00:36:50,612
Oh I'm not gonna
ruin the surprise.

620
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:52,447
I have to pee.

621
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:53,648
Great.

622
00:36:53,682 --> 00:36:54,449
Can you watch him?

623
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:55,250
[Jennifer] Yeah.

624
00:36:55,284 --> 00:36:55,984
[Lauren] Thanks.

625
00:36:59,288 --> 00:37:00,522
[Brad] Hi.

626
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:06,628
Hi.

627
00:37:07,862 --> 00:37:09,030
Hi.

628
00:37:09,063 --> 00:37:10,632
Hi Brad.

629
00:37:13,335 --> 00:37:14,803
Hi.

630
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,808
Hi.

631
00:37:24,513 --> 00:37:26,281
Brad, who're you talking to?

632
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:27,916
Hmm.

633
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:32,354
Hi.

634
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,627
Brad.

635
00:37:39,528 --> 00:37:40,895
Do you see someone?

636
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:42,931
(clattering)

637
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,567
What do you see?

638
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:49,971
It's a ghost in here.

639
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:54,042
(growling)

640
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,478
(thudding, creaking)

641
00:37:57,846 --> 00:37:59,314
You know, I was thinking.

642
00:37:59,348 --> 00:38:00,582
Oh ho.

643
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:01,650
You're alright?

644
00:38:01,683 --> 00:38:02,851
(gasping)

645
00:38:02,884 --> 00:38:03,518
[Jennifer] A door
closed upstairs.

646
00:38:03,552 --> 00:38:04,453
No way.

647
00:38:04,486 --> 00:38:05,687
[Jennifer] I just heard it.

648
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,621
Oh then we have
to go check it out.

649
00:38:06,655 --> 00:38:07,689
I'm not going up there.

650
00:38:07,722 --> 00:38:09,391
[Lauren] Fine I'll go.

651
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,898
There's nothing up here.

652
00:38:25,073 --> 00:38:26,508
Hi.

653
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,550
The ghost is attacking,
mu, mu, mu, mum, mum.

654
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:52,601
[Lauren] Shut the door.

655
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:53,935
[Jennifer] Why?

656
00:38:53,968 --> 00:38:56,037
[Lauren] We have
to block any drafts.

657
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:01,910
This is what I used to
do when we were kids.

658
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:03,845
We shut the door, the windows.

659
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:05,079
Turn off the air.

660
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:08,850
And then you ask questions.

661
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:11,620
And if the flame moves

662
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:14,789
it's the spirit or the ghost
or whatever, responding.

663
00:39:14,823 --> 00:39:15,690
Lauren, I don't know.

664
00:39:15,724 --> 00:39:16,625
No, come on, here.

665
00:39:16,658 --> 00:39:17,992
You've to put your hands on it.

666
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:27,836
Now what?

667
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:28,837
Ask something.

668
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,139
I don't know what to ask.

669
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:32,841
Fine then I'll ask.

670
00:39:35,844 --> 00:39:37,946
Is there somebody down here

671
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:39,013
in the basement with us?

672
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:40,081
Jesus Christ Lauren, don't.

673
00:39:40,114 --> 00:39:41,616
Shh.

674
00:39:43,718 --> 00:39:47,589
Is there somebody or something

675
00:39:48,657 --> 00:39:50,158
here with us now?

676
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:59,167
If there is something
in this house

677
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,937
please make yourself known.

678
00:40:05,574 --> 00:40:07,676
Show us that you're here.

679
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:10,779
Give us a sign.

680
00:40:21,556 --> 00:40:23,124
Lauren, look.

681
00:40:24,058 --> 00:40:25,927
(laughing)

682
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,028
You jerk.

683
00:40:27,061 --> 00:40:27,962
I'm sorry, it's just so.

684
00:40:27,996 --> 00:40:29,998
(thumping)

685
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:31,533
What the hell was that?

686
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:34,503
Lauren, where you going?

687
00:40:34,536 --> 00:40:35,236
Oh we gotta make contact.

688
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,871
[Jennifer] Wait a minute.

689
00:40:38,607 --> 00:40:40,041
Lauren, stop.

690
00:40:40,074 --> 00:40:42,176
Whatever you
are, show yourself.

691
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:44,145
[Jennifer] Come on,
let's just go outside.

692
00:40:44,178 --> 00:40:46,114
Shit.

693
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Something's coming.
Lauren.
Come on, come on, come on.
Lauren, no.
(screaming)

694
00:40:53,121 --> 00:40:54,088
Whoa, what's going on?

695
00:40:54,122 --> 00:40:56,057
Holy shit.

696
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,559
Oh my god you had us so scared.

697
00:40:57,592 --> 00:40:58,527
Yeah I can see that.

698
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,494
What're you doing?

699
00:40:59,528 --> 00:41:00,795
We are amateur ghost hunters

700
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:02,196
and we thought that
you were our ghost.

701
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,632
Ghost hunters?

702
00:41:03,665 --> 00:41:05,634
Oh my god, you
had me so scared.

703
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:07,035
I need wine.

704
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,106
You were hunting ghosts?

705
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,075
We were.

706
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:15,777
You think the
house is haunted?

707
00:41:17,245 --> 00:41:18,780
Yes.

708
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:21,082
Why didn't you tell me?

709
00:41:21,115 --> 00:41:22,183
I tried.

710
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:23,151
I don't know.

711
00:41:23,184 --> 00:41:24,653
Ah come here.

712
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,155
The house isn't haunted.

713
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:29,290
There's no such thing as ghosts.

714
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:32,193
Oh my god, my heart is
just beating out of my chest.

715
00:41:32,226 --> 00:41:34,162
Seriously, you're
lucky I like you.

716
00:41:34,195 --> 00:41:36,097
Wait, that's it?

717
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,298
I mean we're done now?

718
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:39,100
The footsteps were
Luke's so we're done?

719
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:43,171
Jennifer I've
been here all day

720
00:41:43,204 --> 00:41:45,239
and nothing has happened.

721
00:41:45,273 --> 00:41:46,741
The door shut by itself.

722
00:41:46,775 --> 00:41:48,843
Listen, I get it.

723
00:41:48,877 --> 00:41:50,178
New houses are scary.

724
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:51,813
Believe me every
time I move somewhere

725
00:41:51,846 --> 00:41:54,215
I'm convinced it's
haunted and it never is.

726
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,119
There's always an
explanation for everything.

727
00:41:58,152 --> 00:41:59,220
[Luke] Yeah.

728
00:42:02,156 --> 00:42:04,192
[Lauren] Oh, um did we leave
the door open downstairs?

729
00:42:04,225 --> 00:42:05,594
I'll get it.

730
00:42:15,203 --> 00:42:16,805
(click)

731
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:35,724
(dark, ominous music)

732
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:47,201
(thudding)

733
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:53,642
Lauren, Luke.

734
00:42:54,342 --> 00:42:56,077
(laughing, chattering)

735
00:42:57,078 --> 00:42:58,947
[Luke] That is not true.

736
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,682
[Lauren] Well
obviously it's not true.

737
00:43:00,715 --> 00:43:01,950
[Luke] It's not true.

738
00:43:01,983 --> 00:43:02,751
At all.

739
00:43:02,784 --> 00:43:03,685
[Lauren] Yeah, okay.

740
00:43:03,718 --> 00:43:04,152
[Luke] Let me finish the joke.

741
00:43:04,185 --> 00:43:06,254
Okay, so.

742
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:07,221
You never listen.

743
00:43:07,255 --> 00:43:08,156
[Lauren] Well I'm listening.

744
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:09,157
No, no you never listen.

745
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:09,691
I am listening.

746
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:10,291
No.

747
00:43:10,324 --> 00:43:11,960
Luke, I am listening.

748
00:43:11,993 --> 00:43:13,127
[Jennifer] There's a hand
print in the crawlspace.

749
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:15,396
A what?

750
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:17,098
A hand print

751
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:19,801
in the crawlspace.

752
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:22,236
So?

753
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:25,373
So how did it get there?

754
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:28,242
Well, I

755
00:43:28,276 --> 00:43:30,044
checked the traps a
couple of days ago

756
00:43:30,078 --> 00:43:32,681
set a few new ones,
it's probably mine.

757
00:43:32,714 --> 00:43:33,948
Jennifer stop
freaking yourself out,

758
00:43:33,982 --> 00:43:36,951
just come, come sit
with us and talk, okay?

759
00:43:36,985 --> 00:43:38,419
Luke was just telling
me a really funny joke.

760
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:40,021
Come on.

761
00:43:40,054 --> 00:43:40,989
[Luke] Okay so
there're two hunters

762
00:43:41,022 --> 00:43:42,323
they're amateur hunters

763
00:43:42,356 --> 00:43:43,958
[Lauren] Two hunters?

764
00:43:43,992 --> 00:43:44,893
[Luke] And the pro hunters,
they already shot a deer

765
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:46,160
and they're back at the place.

766
00:43:52,734 --> 00:43:54,202
(swoosh)

767
00:44:26,968 --> 00:44:28,903
[Jennifer] Luke?

768
00:44:28,937 --> 00:44:30,338
What're you doing up?

769
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:36,911
[Luke] Someone is
laughing up there?

770
00:44:44,919 --> 00:44:46,354
Laughing?

771
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:50,324
[Luke] They keep
saying your name.

772
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:51,359
[Jennifer] Luke, what are you?

773
00:44:51,392 --> 00:44:52,393
(growling)

774
00:44:52,426 --> 00:44:54,095
(gasping)

775
00:44:55,396 --> 00:44:56,865
What'd you say?

776
00:44:58,066 --> 00:44:59,233
[Jennifer] You heard that?

777
00:45:01,435 --> 00:45:04,005
Luke I didn't say
anything, it wasn't me.

778
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:05,373
[Luke] Okay.

779
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,475
(creaking)

780
00:45:23,491 --> 00:45:25,093
Brad.

781
00:45:26,027 --> 00:45:26,795
What's wrong?

782
00:45:26,828 --> 00:45:27,996
What're you doing up?

783
00:45:30,498 --> 00:45:32,300
Brad?

784
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:33,367
I can't sleep.

785
00:45:35,403 --> 00:45:37,238
Why not?

786
00:45:37,271 --> 00:45:38,339
I'm scared.

787
00:45:42,143 --> 00:45:43,912
There's someone in there.

788
00:45:49,117 --> 00:45:52,320
There's someone in
here like a ghost.

789
00:45:52,353 --> 00:45:54,488
Brad?

790
00:45:54,522 --> 00:45:55,924
Brad what is it?

791
00:45:55,957 --> 00:45:57,892
Is it what you
saw earlier today?

792
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,361
Brad look at me, what is it?

793
00:46:00,394 --> 00:46:01,295
What did you see?

794
00:46:01,329 --> 00:46:02,096
Come on.

795
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,431
What did you see?

796
00:46:03,464 --> 00:46:04,365
Brad?

797
00:46:04,398 --> 00:46:05,433
Brad look at me, what is it?

798
00:46:05,466 --> 00:46:06,467
Brad what did you see?

799
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,401
What did you see?

800
00:46:07,435 --> 00:46:08,803
Tell me, what did you see?

801
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:12,240
(clattering)

802
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

803
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,356
(screaming)

804
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:30,024
What's going on?

805
00:46:30,058 --> 00:46:30,825
What going on?

806
00:46:30,859 --> 00:46:31,559
What happened?

807
00:46:31,592 --> 00:46:32,360
There's something out here.

808
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:34,028
Why is Brad out here?

809
00:46:34,062 --> 00:46:35,363
I heard him out here, I came
out to see what was wrong.

810
00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:36,264
He's bleeding.

811
00:46:36,297 --> 00:46:36,931
[Luke] What?

812
00:46:36,965 --> 00:46:38,199
Is he okay?

813
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:39,133
[Lauren] No, do you
have a first aid kit?

814
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:39,600
[Luke] In the bathroom.

815
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:40,801
Lauren?

816
00:46:44,405 --> 00:46:46,507
(Brad crying)

817
00:46:52,146 --> 00:46:53,247
Luke, I swear.

818
00:46:53,281 --> 00:46:54,448
Stop.

819
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:57,218
It's three in the morning.

820
00:46:58,953 --> 00:46:59,587
There was someone.

821
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,056
No, stop.

822
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,392
[Lauren] Come here,
it's okay, shh, come here.

823
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,502
(wind howling)

824
00:47:20,574 --> 00:47:22,443
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay?

825
00:47:22,476 --> 00:47:24,545
I mean I can stay another
day, if you guys want.

826
00:47:24,578 --> 00:47:27,882
No, it's fine really,
thanks for coming.

827
00:47:27,916 --> 00:47:29,450
Yeah, Luke, thanks.

828
00:47:29,483 --> 00:47:30,985
[Luke] You're welcome.

829
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:32,320
Come here bud.

830
00:47:33,587 --> 00:47:34,555
Say goodbye.

831
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:35,223
Bye.

832
00:47:35,256 --> 00:47:35,890
[Luke] Bye.

833
00:47:35,924 --> 00:47:36,624
Alright.

834
00:47:39,593 --> 00:47:41,362
I know, we're
going, we're going.

835
00:47:42,997 --> 00:47:44,298
Miss you, love you.

836
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:46,500
Miss you, love you.

837
00:48:01,015 --> 00:48:02,416
What's going on?

838
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:04,485
I told you.

839
00:48:10,024 --> 00:48:11,392
The house is haunted?

840
00:48:15,063 --> 00:48:17,065
Then how come I
haven't seen anything?

841
00:48:17,098 --> 00:48:19,433
I live here too you know,
I haven't seen a thing.

842
00:48:19,467 --> 00:48:20,668
But I have.

843
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,072
That should be enough.

844
00:48:25,373 --> 00:48:26,474
Well what do
you suggest we do?

845
00:48:26,507 --> 00:48:27,341
I wanna move.

846
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:28,476
Honey, we can't move.

847
00:48:28,509 --> 00:48:29,677
Then I wanna call someone.

848
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,046
To have someone come in here
and figure out what's going on.

849
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,514
Jennifer there's

850
00:48:33,547 --> 00:48:34,715
nothing going on.

851
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:36,650
There was a man at
the house warming party.

852
00:48:36,684 --> 00:48:39,187
A friend of my mother's, he
said he picked up on things

853
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,555
and that our house has
an interesting energy.

854
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:43,657
Okay, so our house has
an interesting energy.

855
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:45,559
Fine.

856
00:48:45,593 --> 00:48:47,028
Did he say get out of the house

857
00:48:47,061 --> 00:48:47,996
or there's a ghost
in there with you?

858
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:48,562
I'm gonna call him.

859
00:48:48,596 --> 00:48:49,563
No.

860
00:48:49,597 --> 00:48:51,499
Jennifer you're not.

861
00:48:51,532 --> 00:48:53,634
Please, I'm starting to
get a little worried here.

862
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:55,169
This is all starting to sound
like what happened in Chicago.

863
00:48:55,203 --> 00:48:56,537
Luke.

864
00:49:01,575 --> 00:49:02,576
I saw something.

865
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,545
You didn't see anything.

866
00:49:07,048 --> 00:49:08,516
God you're stressed.

867
00:49:09,683 --> 00:49:11,685
Your mind's playing
tricks on you that's all.

868
00:49:12,686 --> 00:49:15,289
Look, it's like
what Lauren said,

869
00:49:15,323 --> 00:49:17,725
"There's an explanation
for everything."

870
00:49:19,027 --> 00:49:20,661
The next time something
happens, confront it.

871
00:49:20,694 --> 00:49:22,530
Go see what it is.

872
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:26,267
Stay calm.

873
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,302
Go at it rationally.

874
00:49:30,804 --> 00:49:33,041
And I think your
ghosts will go away.

875
00:49:34,575 --> 00:49:36,610
And what if they don't?

876
00:49:36,644 --> 00:49:38,212
They will.

877
00:49:39,247 --> 00:49:41,215
Give it a few days.

878
00:49:41,249 --> 00:49:42,583
I promise.

879
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:55,129
(knocking)

880
00:49:57,165 --> 00:49:58,732
[Delivery Man] Mrs. Branagan?

881
00:49:58,766 --> 00:49:59,667
Yes.

882
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,402
I need you to sign
here for me please.

883
00:50:03,604 --> 00:50:05,406
Need help carrying this in?

884
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,574
No thank you, I'll be fine.

885
00:50:06,607 --> 00:50:09,009
Well don't go hauling that
thing upstairs alone now.

886
00:50:10,178 --> 00:50:12,146
Get your husband to take it up.

887
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,082
(dark, ominous music)

888
00:51:04,465 --> 00:51:05,266
(thud)

889
00:51:05,299 --> 00:51:07,335
(gasping)

890
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:08,802
(grunting)

891
00:51:15,876 --> 00:51:17,778
(clattering)

892
00:51:21,515 --> 00:51:22,616
(screaming)

893
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:24,485
[Jennifer] No, no.

894
00:51:25,353 --> 00:51:26,487
Help.

895
00:51:27,355 --> 00:51:29,123
(gurgling)

896
00:51:33,194 --> 00:51:34,862
(screaming)

897
00:51:52,713 --> 00:51:54,715
Jennifer, my dear how are you?

898
00:51:54,748 --> 00:51:55,883
Thank you for coming, Walter.

899
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:57,718
Not at all.

900
00:51:57,751 --> 00:52:00,921
I must say, I was
a bit surprised to
receive your call but

901
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:02,390
delighted though.

902
00:52:04,192 --> 00:52:05,859
And you must be Luke.

903
00:52:11,932 --> 00:52:13,334
[Jennifer] What're
you doing here?

904
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:14,635
I heard there was
a party here tonight.

905
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:16,304
Little birdie told me.

906
00:52:16,337 --> 00:52:17,671
Am I late?

907
00:52:20,674 --> 00:52:23,311
And Meredith,
lovely as always.

908
00:52:27,915 --> 00:52:30,784
Well, I suppose we
should give this a go.

909
00:52:31,885 --> 00:52:33,721
Let's head upstairs shall we?

910
00:52:35,923 --> 00:52:38,459
(dark, melodious music)

911
00:53:17,431 --> 00:53:20,934
Luke, Meredith, would you
excuse us for a few minutes?

912
00:53:21,902 --> 00:53:22,870
I think it would be best

913
00:53:22,903 --> 00:53:25,639
if I had a little talk
with Jennifer, alone.

914
00:53:26,674 --> 00:53:28,476
[Luke] Wait, are you serious?

915
00:53:28,509 --> 00:53:30,411
I think it would be best.

916
00:53:31,512 --> 00:53:32,913
Let's go Luke.

917
00:53:32,946 --> 00:53:34,715
He's harmless.

918
00:53:34,748 --> 00:53:36,817
Let them have their fun.

919
00:53:38,852 --> 00:53:40,220
We won't be long.

920
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,498
I'm afraid I owe you
a bit of an apology.

921
00:53:52,466 --> 00:53:53,401
An apology?

922
00:53:53,434 --> 00:53:55,336
Yes.

923
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:58,439
I should've been more clear
when agreeing to see you.

924
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,975
Your expectations may
not be met this evening.

925
00:54:03,711 --> 00:54:05,979
I don't know what
you're talking about.

926
00:54:06,013 --> 00:54:08,015
I'm not a medium, Jennifer.

927
00:54:08,048 --> 00:54:09,950
I'm not psychic.

928
00:54:09,983 --> 00:54:12,620
I've never done anything
like this before,

929
00:54:12,653 --> 00:54:14,322
reading.

930
00:54:14,355 --> 00:54:17,325
Oh I have tried in the past to

931
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:19,860
contact the other
side, if you will but

932
00:54:20,961 --> 00:54:23,030
well I never had
much luck with that.

933
00:54:24,965 --> 00:54:26,934
You see, most people
expect someone like me

934
00:54:26,967 --> 00:54:29,036
to come in and tell them

935
00:54:29,069 --> 00:54:31,739
exactly what's going
on in their house.

936
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:32,906
Who's to blame?

937
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:33,441
A name?

938
00:54:33,474 --> 00:54:35,075
A face?

939
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:36,877
What they can do to stop it?

940
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:40,614
But the very definition
of paranormal is

941
00:54:40,648 --> 00:54:43,684
that, that can not be
explained or defined.

942
00:54:43,717 --> 00:54:46,053
It is outside of our
knowledge, outside of our

943
00:54:46,086 --> 00:54:48,422
understanding of the world.

944
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:50,791
It's the unknown.

945
00:54:51,925 --> 00:54:54,928
Which I suppose is why
it's so terrifying, huh?

946
00:54:57,931 --> 00:55:00,067
I'm fairly certain
there is something

947
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,503
going on in your house.

948
00:55:02,536 --> 00:55:04,438
I felt it at the
night of the party.

949
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:08,976
And I feel it now, here
in this room with us.

950
00:55:10,911 --> 00:55:13,581
But I'm afraid that's the
end of the line for me.

951
00:55:14,482 --> 00:55:17,618
I don't know what it is.

952
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:19,987
And I don't think I can
answer your questions.

953
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,460
So that's it?

954
00:55:27,695 --> 00:55:29,830
I mean you're not
even gonna try?

955
00:55:29,863 --> 00:55:30,898
Jennifer, I'd, I.

956
00:55:30,931 --> 00:55:31,999
So you're not a medium.

957
00:55:32,032 --> 00:55:32,933
Fine, but

958
00:55:32,966 --> 00:55:34,968
you said yourself you
pick up on things.

959
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:36,904
And you feel something
here, you just said that.

960
00:55:36,937 --> 00:55:37,771
Yes, but.

961
00:55:37,805 --> 00:55:39,039
Then try.

962
00:55:39,072 --> 00:55:40,874
Please, just

963
00:55:40,908 --> 00:55:42,376
ask it.

964
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:43,143
Ask it what it it is?

965
00:55:43,176 --> 00:55:45,012
What it wants from me?

966
00:55:46,146 --> 00:55:47,781
Please.

967
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,088
Do you know of anyone
who died in this house?

968
00:55:55,122 --> 00:55:56,590
Any trauma of any kind?

969
00:55:56,624 --> 00:55:57,758
No.

970
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:58,959
I looked online, I
couldn't find anything.

971
00:55:58,992 --> 00:56:00,528
Nor I.

972
00:56:01,762 --> 00:56:03,864
This is just a house Jennifer.

973
00:56:05,065 --> 00:56:08,135
With seemingly no reason
why it should hold a ghost.

974
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:11,104
Don't you see?

975
00:56:11,138 --> 00:56:13,874
I have tried.

976
00:56:13,907 --> 00:56:16,043
Whatever's here

977
00:56:16,076 --> 00:56:18,412
is much more
complicated than that.

978
00:56:23,917 --> 00:56:25,085
(sighing)

979
00:56:25,118 --> 00:56:26,887
Why are you here?

980
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,055
Excuse me?

981
00:56:28,088 --> 00:56:30,491
If you can't help me at all

982
00:56:30,524 --> 00:56:32,526
why did you even agree to come?

983
00:56:37,097 --> 00:56:40,100
I've tried for so many
years to ignore this thing.

984
00:56:41,669 --> 00:56:43,537
I guess I thought maybe
coming here tonight

985
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:45,839
would be different that,

986
00:56:45,873 --> 00:56:48,175
finding I could help.

987
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:50,010
I was curious.

988
00:56:51,044 --> 00:56:52,480
I'm sorry.

989
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:54,181
I was wrong.

990
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,787
So you're wasting my time.

991
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,721
Jennifer.

992
00:57:00,754 --> 00:57:01,855
You come into my house.

993
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:04,858
You stare at my staircase
all mysterious and eerie.

994
00:57:04,892 --> 00:57:06,860
You say something about my baby,

995
00:57:06,894 --> 00:57:08,596
something you have
no way of knowing

996
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:09,997
and then you come
over here tonight

997
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,065
and tell what's
been terrorizing me,

998
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:14,602
is more complicated then
some run of the mill ghost.

999
00:57:14,635 --> 00:57:17,070
And also there's nothing
I can do about it.

1000
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:17,738
Jennifer.

1001
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:19,072
No, get out.

1002
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:20,641
If you can't help me,
you need to leave.

1003
00:57:20,674 --> 00:57:21,909
Jennifer, please.

1004
00:57:21,942 --> 00:57:23,176
I need to figure out
what's going on here,

1005
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:25,145
do you understand?

1006
00:57:25,178 --> 00:57:26,714
I have a real problem,

1007
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:28,582
I need real help.

1008
00:57:29,216 --> 00:57:30,150
Get out.

1009
00:57:30,183 --> 00:57:30,818
Jennifer.

1010
00:57:30,851 --> 00:57:31,819
Get out.

1011
00:57:31,852 --> 00:57:33,220
(clattering)

1012
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:40,494
(dark, mysterious music)

1013
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,665
Walter?

1014
00:57:55,242 --> 00:57:56,076
I'll be off now.

1015
00:57:56,109 --> 00:57:58,211
Walter, wait,
what just happened?

1016
00:57:58,245 --> 00:58:01,181
Lovely seeing you
again, Jennifer.

1017
00:58:01,214 --> 00:58:02,783
No, please come back.

1018
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:04,585
Walter.

1019
00:58:04,618 --> 00:58:06,286
No, stop.

1020
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,154
Jennifer?

1021
00:58:07,187 --> 00:58:08,255
What's going on?

1022
00:58:08,288 --> 00:58:09,122
[Jennifer] Luke, stop
him, don't let him leave.

1023
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:10,123
Walter?

1024
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:11,058
You don't understand.

1025
00:58:11,091 --> 00:58:11,725
[Luke] Calm down, stop.

1026
00:58:11,759 --> 00:58:12,793
I'll call you.

1027
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:15,796
(thump, grunting)

1028
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:23,537
Are you trying to scare me?

1029
00:58:23,571 --> 00:58:25,172
Is that what this is?

1030
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:27,207
You wanna go back
to Chicago so bad

1031
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,943
you're trying to scare me out
of this house, aren't you?

1032
00:58:29,977 --> 00:58:30,744
What?

1033
00:58:30,778 --> 00:58:32,045
I can't believe this.

1034
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:32,980
I should've never
agreed to this.

1035
00:58:33,013 --> 00:58:34,181
There was no reason
for Walter to come.

1036
00:58:34,214 --> 00:58:36,083
What about the closet door?

1037
00:58:36,116 --> 00:58:37,551
How are you going
to explain that?

1038
00:58:37,585 --> 00:58:39,553
It's an old house.

1039
00:58:39,587 --> 00:58:41,121
It's old wood, it was

1040
00:58:41,154 --> 00:58:42,055
humidity.

1041
00:58:42,089 --> 00:58:44,091
These things happen, Jennifer.

1042
00:58:44,124 --> 00:58:45,125
I mean seriously,
you need to take

1043
00:58:45,158 --> 00:58:46,560
a step back for a second

1044
00:58:46,594 --> 00:58:48,528
and listen to yourself.

1045
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:50,798
Ghosts?

1046
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:52,633
A medium, for Christ's sake.

1047
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:54,234
It's all just a little.

1048
00:58:54,267 --> 00:58:56,570
What?

1049
00:58:56,604 --> 00:58:58,305
It's all just a little what?

1050
00:58:59,372 --> 00:59:00,674
Crazy?

1051
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:02,175
I didn't say that.

1052
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:06,046
You didn't have to.

1053
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,815
Fine.

1054
00:59:07,848 --> 00:59:09,049
If that's what you
want me to say,

1055
00:59:09,082 --> 00:59:10,250
you're right.

1056
00:59:10,283 --> 00:59:11,852
You're acting crazy.

1057
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:13,987
Walter saw something.

1058
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:15,288
Luke, you weren't there,

1059
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:17,090
you didn't see the
look on his face.

1060
00:59:17,124 --> 00:59:19,159
He said there's something
complicated going on here.

1061
00:59:19,192 --> 00:59:20,293
I saw enough.

1062
00:59:20,327 --> 00:59:21,795
Well, Luke listen to me.

1063
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:23,163
Listen to me.

1064
00:59:24,297 --> 00:59:26,166
If you came to me and told me,

1065
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:27,300
you thought the
house was haunted,

1066
00:59:27,334 --> 00:59:29,603
I'd believe you or at least,

1067
00:59:29,637 --> 00:59:30,838
listen to you.

1068
00:59:30,871 --> 00:59:32,973
But I'm not coming to
you with any of that.

1069
00:59:34,174 --> 00:59:36,176
Because I don't think
the house is haunted.

1070
00:59:36,209 --> 00:59:37,144
And honestly,

1071
00:59:37,177 --> 00:59:39,212
I don't think there's
anything to figure out,

1072
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:41,081
except why it's so
hard for you to focus

1073
00:59:41,114 --> 00:59:42,916
on anything other than yourself?

1074
00:59:44,885 --> 00:59:46,820
What?

1075
00:59:47,988 --> 00:59:49,356
No more ghosts.

1076
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:03,937
(splashing)

1077
01:00:17,217 --> 01:00:18,919
Hello?

1078
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:38,371
(clattering)

1079
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,317
(dark, ominous music)

1080
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:08,001
(fizzing)

1081
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:32,192
(thumping, thudding)

1082
01:01:35,162 --> 01:01:36,329
[Voiceover] Hi, you've
reached Walter Vance.

1083
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:38,799
I'm not available at the moment
but please leave a message.

1084
01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:40,133
(beep)

1085
01:01:51,311 --> 01:01:52,813
(knocking)

1086
01:01:57,117 --> 01:01:58,318
Jennifer.

1087
01:01:58,351 --> 01:01:59,820
Hi, Marlene.

1088
01:02:01,955 --> 01:02:03,356
Can I come in?

1089
01:02:12,532 --> 01:02:14,134
Thank you.

1090
01:02:18,939 --> 01:02:20,273
Are these your daughters?

1091
01:02:20,307 --> 01:02:21,975
Uh hmm.

1092
01:02:22,009 --> 01:02:24,111
Lucy and Claire.

1093
01:02:26,814 --> 01:02:28,115
You're scared.

1094
01:02:29,516 --> 01:02:31,418
What?

1095
01:02:31,451 --> 01:02:33,320
You look scared.

1096
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:43,263
Did you know the people

1097
01:02:43,296 --> 01:02:44,865
who lived in the
house before we did?

1098
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:46,399
Hm hmm.

1099
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:48,468
A family.

1100
01:02:48,501 --> 01:02:49,803
Nice people.

1101
01:02:53,406 --> 01:02:54,842
Do you know why they moved?

1102
01:02:56,076 --> 01:02:58,111
Just had somewhere
else to be I guess.

1103
01:02:58,145 --> 01:02:59,479
Happened pretty fast.

1104
01:03:02,449 --> 01:03:04,852
Do you know if they
experienced anything

1105
01:03:05,585 --> 01:03:08,355
strange in the house?

1106
01:03:08,388 --> 01:03:10,390
Strange?

1107
01:03:10,423 --> 01:03:11,925
Yeah, like

1108
01:03:14,094 --> 01:03:15,462
ghosts?

1109
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:19,299
You think the
house is haunted?

1110
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:21,801
I don't know.

1111
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:25,105
Yes.

1112
01:03:25,138 --> 01:03:26,573
I think.

1113
01:03:26,606 --> 01:03:27,875
Have you ever?

1114
01:03:27,908 --> 01:03:29,276
Uh hmm.

1115
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:34,114
'Cause I just
would feel better

1116
01:03:34,147 --> 01:03:36,349
if I knew someone else had
gone through it too, you know?

1117
01:03:37,517 --> 01:03:39,419
Luke doesn't believe me.

1118
01:03:39,452 --> 01:03:42,589
He thinks it's all in my head.

1119
01:03:42,622 --> 01:03:45,425
I feel like everything is
spinning out of control.

1120
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,827
But I refuse to believe that it,

1121
01:03:51,098 --> 01:03:52,565
I mean there has
to be something.

1122
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:54,534
Right?

1123
01:03:54,567 --> 01:03:56,169
Some sort of answer.

1124
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:05,078
My daughters, they

1125
01:04:05,913 --> 01:04:07,414
they don't talk.

1126
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:13,921
Since they were about four.

1127
01:04:13,954 --> 01:04:15,488
I had some guests over.

1128
01:04:16,556 --> 01:04:18,225
They made a game out of it.

1129
01:04:19,392 --> 01:04:21,628
I won't talk to mommy's
friends if you don't.

1130
01:04:24,631 --> 01:04:26,433
They haven't said
anything since.

1131
01:04:30,603 --> 01:04:33,040
It's called selective mutism.

1132
01:04:33,073 --> 01:04:36,476
There's nothing wrong
with them, they just

1133
01:04:36,509 --> 01:04:38,478
don't talk.

1134
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:44,551
I took them to dozens of
doctors and therapists.

1135
01:04:46,219 --> 01:04:48,255
Nobody could tell me anything.

1136
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,624
I went into debt,

1137
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:54,427
I got obsessive,

1138
01:04:55,628 --> 01:04:57,597
I got mean.

1139
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:01,368
I let my marriage fall apart.

1140
01:05:04,504 --> 01:05:08,575
And then about a year
ago I sat them down,

1141
01:05:08,608 --> 01:05:11,611
tried to explain things to them.

1142
01:05:11,644 --> 01:05:13,413
They'd never get a job,

1143
01:05:13,446 --> 01:05:16,183
never start a family, if they

1144
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:17,550
didn't talk.

1145
01:05:20,753 --> 01:05:24,157
I told them if they could
just try a little harder,

1146
01:05:26,359 --> 01:05:28,295
help me out a little bit,

1147
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:33,700
that they could get better.

1148
01:05:37,004 --> 01:05:38,671
They could talk again.

1149
01:05:44,544 --> 01:05:47,280
And then Lucy looked right at me

1150
01:05:47,314 --> 01:05:51,718
and she said, "We could
talk if we wanted to."

1151
01:05:53,386 --> 01:05:56,589
First thing she'd said
to me in 10 years.

1152
01:05:58,225 --> 01:06:00,693
"We could talk if we wanted to."

1153
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:09,069
I used to think there was
a reason for all of it.

1154
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,372
Now I'm not sure.

1155
01:06:14,207 --> 01:06:17,110
I think sometimes
things just happen.

1156
01:06:19,246 --> 01:06:24,051
There's no use ruining your
life looking for explanations.

1157
01:06:33,593 --> 01:06:35,762
My husband should
be getting home soon.

1158
01:06:38,698 --> 01:06:40,533
I'll walk you out.

1159
01:06:45,372 --> 01:06:47,340
I'm sorry for
barging in like that.

1160
01:06:47,374 --> 01:06:48,708
You're welcome any time.

1161
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,644
Jennifer.

1162
01:06:54,581 --> 01:06:56,616
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

1163
01:07:02,755 --> 01:07:04,491
Luke?

1164
01:07:04,524 --> 01:07:05,792
[Luke] Up here.

1165
01:07:10,797 --> 01:07:12,399
Hey.

1166
01:07:15,268 --> 01:07:17,337
I know you don't wanna
talk about this but.

1167
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:18,805
(clattering)

1168
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:21,040
Did you hear that?

1169
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:23,810
Luke, listen.

1170
01:07:25,778 --> 01:07:26,746
Oh.

1171
01:07:26,779 --> 01:07:28,415
(thud)

1172
01:07:30,617 --> 01:07:32,219
(banging)

1173
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Luke.
Jennifer.

1174
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:40,427
(screaming)

1175
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:41,361
What is it?

1176
01:07:41,394 --> 01:07:41,828
What's going on?

1177
01:07:41,861 --> 01:07:42,662
What is it?

1178
01:07:42,695 --> 01:07:43,663
Are you okay?

1179
01:07:43,696 --> 01:07:44,597
I just saw.

1180
01:07:44,631 --> 01:07:45,565
You were in the room with me.

1181
01:07:45,598 --> 01:07:47,066
What?

1182
01:07:48,768 --> 01:07:50,737
What's happening to me?

1183
01:07:51,871 --> 01:07:52,772
Oh boy.

1184
01:07:52,805 --> 01:07:54,374
Alright okay.

1185
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:58,711
You're too wound up.

1186
01:07:59,746 --> 01:08:00,680
Just.

1187
01:08:00,713 --> 01:08:02,115
Luke.

1188
01:08:12,792 --> 01:08:14,461
It opens on its own.

1189
01:08:23,803 --> 01:08:25,805
(scraping)

1190
01:08:31,544 --> 01:08:32,712
Better?

1191
01:08:38,485 --> 01:08:39,752
Just rest.

1192
01:08:42,322 --> 01:08:44,391
I'll stay with you
till you fall asleep.

1193
01:09:10,483 --> 01:09:12,285
(thudding)

1194
01:09:21,861 --> 01:09:23,763
(dark, menacing music)

1195
01:09:37,977 --> 01:09:39,446
I get it.

1196
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:41,214
(chattering)

1197
01:09:41,248 --> 01:09:42,349
Luke?

1198
01:09:42,382 --> 01:09:43,883
Oh jenny, you're up.

1199
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:47,754
What's going on?

1200
01:09:47,787 --> 01:09:48,888
(chuckling)

1201
01:09:48,921 --> 01:09:49,789
Oh, we were just discussing

1202
01:09:49,822 --> 01:09:52,592
that you've been a
bit tired recently.

1203
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:53,926
Weren't we?

1204
01:09:56,329 --> 01:09:57,530
Honey, why don't you sit down?

1205
01:09:57,564 --> 01:09:59,466
Will one of you
please tell me,

1206
01:09:59,499 --> 01:10:00,900
what's going on?

1207
01:10:02,502 --> 01:10:03,903
We're concerned.

1208
01:10:03,936 --> 01:10:06,939
Luke told me you gave him a
bit of a scare last night.

1209
01:10:06,973 --> 01:10:08,375
He did?

1210
01:10:08,408 --> 01:10:09,376
And he mentioned
that you were still

1211
01:10:09,409 --> 01:10:11,811
raving about ghosts?

1212
01:10:12,979 --> 01:10:14,581
It's just.

1213
01:10:15,415 --> 01:10:16,883
Well.

1214
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:19,819
This has been going on for
quite some time, Jenny.

1215
01:10:19,852 --> 01:10:21,354
You've been acting strange

1216
01:10:21,388 --> 01:10:23,956
ever since you got back home.

1217
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:25,892
And that stunt that
you pulled with Walter.

1218
01:10:25,925 --> 01:10:26,826
Stunt?

1219
01:10:26,859 --> 01:10:27,894
And hysterics last night.

1220
01:10:27,927 --> 01:10:28,828
Hysterics?

1221
01:10:28,861 --> 01:10:30,530
What are you talking about?

1222
01:10:30,563 --> 01:10:32,599
Well it all seems a bit
crazy, don't you think?

1223
01:10:35,835 --> 01:10:36,836
I'm not crazy.

1224
01:10:36,869 --> 01:10:38,771
Of course you're not, Jenny.

1225
01:10:38,805 --> 01:10:41,874
But you can understand why we
would both be alarmed, right?

1226
01:10:43,476 --> 01:10:46,646
There's something
going on in this house.

1227
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:50,016
It scares me.

1228
01:10:50,983 --> 01:10:52,985
And it scares me even
more that the two.

1229
01:10:53,019 --> 01:10:55,655
Luke hasn't noticed
anything out of the ordinary.

1230
01:10:55,688 --> 01:10:56,556
That doesn't mean anything.

1231
01:10:56,589 --> 01:10:57,790
I don't understand.

1232
01:10:57,824 --> 01:11:00,026
We don't want you
hurting the baby again.

1233
01:11:04,697 --> 01:11:06,899
Now, I've made an
appointment for you

1234
01:11:06,933 --> 01:11:08,601
with a psychiatrist next week.

1235
01:11:08,635 --> 01:11:10,537
He's a very good friend of mine.

1236
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:13,506
You'll see him three times a
week until the baby's born.

1237
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:15,308
After that we'll reassess.

1238
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:20,046
We just want what's
best for you.

1239
01:11:41,368 --> 01:11:44,070
(dark, threatening music)

1240
01:12:47,099 --> 01:12:49,035
(rustling)

1241
01:13:06,986 --> 01:13:08,921
What do you want from me?

1242
01:13:08,955 --> 01:13:10,790
(creaking)

1243
01:13:12,759 --> 01:13:14,894
(thudding)

1244
01:13:14,927 --> 01:13:15,995
(gasping)

1245
01:13:23,803 --> 01:13:25,438
(knocking)

1246
01:13:36,516 --> 01:13:38,017
Is your Mom home?

1247
01:13:39,919 --> 01:13:42,054
You Mom, Marlene is she home?

1248
01:13:44,123 --> 01:13:45,925
(groaning)

1249
01:13:48,995 --> 01:13:50,162
Please I need to
speak to someone.

1250
01:13:51,063 --> 01:13:52,732
You Mom, where is she?

1251
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:55,535
Where is she?

1252
01:13:56,936 --> 01:13:59,005
Do you not understand
what I'm saying?

1253
01:14:01,974 --> 01:14:03,142
(dial tone)

1254
01:14:03,175 --> 01:14:05,111
[Voiceover] Hi, you've
reached Walter Vance.

1255
01:14:05,144 --> 01:14:07,213
I'm not available at the
moment but pleave a message.

1256
01:14:07,246 --> 01:14:08,548
(beep)

1257
01:14:08,581 --> 01:14:10,049
(groaning)

1258
01:14:17,289 --> 01:14:19,458
(screaming)

1259
01:14:21,628 --> 01:14:24,096
(light, melodious music)

1260
01:14:29,736 --> 01:14:30,737
Jenny?

1261
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:32,639
What're you doing here?

1262
01:14:32,672 --> 01:14:34,073
Is everything okay?

1263
01:14:37,744 --> 01:14:40,079
Should I make some coffee?

1264
01:14:40,112 --> 01:14:41,614
I have decaf.

1265
01:14:43,182 --> 01:14:44,917
Coffee would be nice.

1266
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:21,220
I know you and Luke just
want what's best for me.

1267
01:15:22,354 --> 01:15:23,089
I haven't.

1268
01:15:23,122 --> 01:15:24,256
I know Jenny.

1269
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:25,892
I know.

1270
01:15:35,635 --> 01:15:37,103
This is nice.

1271
01:15:38,004 --> 01:15:39,572
It is, isn't it?

1272
01:15:51,984 --> 01:15:54,754
I have always cherished
our moments together.

1273
01:15:57,223 --> 01:15:59,759
Remember getting ready
for your pageants?

1274
01:16:02,094 --> 01:16:05,131
All that primping and preening.

1275
01:16:05,164 --> 01:16:07,133
Dolling you up.

1276
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:08,701
(chuckling lightly)

1277
01:16:11,003 --> 01:16:13,572
Those are some of
my fondest memories.

1278
01:16:15,274 --> 01:16:17,076
You and me.

1279
01:16:19,946 --> 01:16:23,215
All that beauty and promise.

1280
01:16:28,254 --> 01:16:30,089
I have an idea.

1281
01:16:31,357 --> 01:16:33,159
(clicking)

1282
01:16:33,192 --> 01:16:35,662
You have always had
the most lovely hair.

1283
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,202
I can't believe you're here.

1284
01:16:46,305 --> 01:16:48,307
Luke's in for quite
a shock tonight

1285
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:51,343
when you get home
looking so beautiful.

1286
01:17:00,186 --> 01:17:02,321
I really am glad you're back.

1287
01:17:06,225 --> 01:17:08,360
I don't know what
happened with us.

1288
01:17:12,264 --> 01:17:15,034
But with the baby and the move

1289
01:17:15,067 --> 01:17:16,635
and everything,

1290
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:21,908
I can't help but see
it as a second chance.

1291
01:17:25,011 --> 01:17:27,279
And who knows,

1292
01:17:27,313 --> 01:17:29,849
maybe the next one'll
be a little girl.

1293
01:17:31,951 --> 01:17:33,886
I have to use the restroom.

1294
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,254
Okay.

1295
01:17:35,287 --> 01:17:37,223
I'll be here when you get back.

1296
01:17:52,271 --> 01:17:54,874
(thudding)

1297
01:17:54,907 --> 01:17:56,876
(squeaking)

1298
01:18:02,414 --> 01:18:03,983
(shattering)

1299
01:18:09,288 --> 01:18:10,389
[Jennifer] Luke just called.

1300
01:18:10,422 --> 01:18:11,323
I should get going.

1301
01:18:11,357 --> 01:18:12,291
We haven't finished your hair.

1302
01:18:12,324 --> 01:18:13,793
Oh I can just pin this back.

1303
01:18:13,826 --> 01:18:15,762
It sounded like
he had a hard day.

1304
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,905
Jenny are you feeling okay?

1305
01:18:25,938 --> 01:18:27,006
Yes.

1306
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:28,374
(thudding, gasping)

1307
01:18:30,843 --> 01:18:32,411
Jenny, why are you so jumpy?

1308
01:18:33,379 --> 01:18:34,981
Jenny what's happening?

1309
01:18:36,248 --> 01:18:37,917
I have to go.

1310
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:39,451
Jenny?

1311
01:18:39,485 --> 01:18:41,253
Jenny?

1312
01:18:41,287 --> 01:18:43,823
(thump, shattering)

1313
01:18:43,856 --> 01:18:45,357
Jenny, what's wrong?

1314
01:18:47,426 --> 01:18:49,261
Jenny?

1315
01:18:49,295 --> 01:18:50,763
Jenny?

1316
01:18:52,431 --> 01:18:54,366
(car rumbling)

1317
01:18:55,968 --> 01:18:57,469
(knocking)

1318
01:18:57,503 --> 01:18:59,305
Walter?

1319
01:18:59,338 --> 01:19:00,907
Walter, please.

1320
01:19:08,815 --> 01:19:10,516
(screaming)

1321
01:19:10,549 --> 01:19:12,084
Ma'am?

1322
01:19:16,989 --> 01:19:18,357
Are you okay?

1323
01:19:20,126 --> 01:19:22,394
(dark, menacing music)

1324
01:19:33,005 --> 01:19:34,473
Get out of my head.

1325
01:19:37,609 --> 01:19:39,245
Get out.

1326
01:19:39,278 --> 01:19:40,379
Jennifer?

1327
01:19:40,412 --> 01:19:41,380
Jesus Christ.

1328
01:19:41,413 --> 01:19:43,415
Jennifer, Jennifer?

1329
01:19:43,449 --> 01:19:44,350
Luke.

1330
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,017
Honey, what's going on?

1331
01:19:45,051 --> 01:19:45,818
What's going on?

1332
01:19:45,852 --> 01:19:47,086
It's the house.

1333
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:48,287
We need to get
you to a doctor.

1334
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,122
No, no, it isn't,
it's the house.

1335
01:19:50,156 --> 01:19:52,524
(growling)

1336
01:19:52,558 --> 01:19:54,827
Meredith?

1337
01:19:54,861 --> 01:19:57,463
Yeah, she's here, I don't know.

1338
01:19:57,496 --> 01:19:58,497
No, it's not good.

1339
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:00,199
Get out.

1340
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,335
Meredith I gotta go,
we'll meet you there.

1341
01:20:04,236 --> 01:20:05,537
Jennifer,

1342
01:20:05,571 --> 01:20:06,338
stay here.

1343
01:20:06,372 --> 01:20:08,040
(gasping)

1344
01:20:08,074 --> 01:20:09,976
(thunder rumbling, pattering)

1345
01:20:10,009 --> 01:20:11,243
I'm gonna get you
out of the house.

1346
01:20:11,277 --> 01:20:13,079
I just need to call the doctor.

1347
01:20:13,112 --> 01:20:14,113
It's the house.

1348
01:20:14,146 --> 01:20:15,581
It's in my head.

1349
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,086
It wants you to think I'm crazy.

1350
01:20:20,119 --> 01:20:21,387
[Luke] Stay here.

1351
01:20:28,427 --> 01:20:30,396
I'm here.

1352
01:20:30,429 --> 01:20:32,431
Tell me what you want.

1353
01:20:34,666 --> 01:20:36,468
(scraping)

1354
01:20:41,507 --> 01:20:43,242
(screaming)

1355
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:15,541
Luke.

1356
01:21:19,478 --> 01:21:21,513
Luke.

1357
01:21:21,547 --> 01:21:23,349
(thudding)

1358
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,589
(gasping)

1359
01:21:30,622 --> 01:21:32,258
Jenny?

1360
01:21:32,291 --> 01:21:33,325
Luke, she's awake.

1361
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:34,126
(whimpering)

1362
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,161
No, no, no, no, sweety.

1363
01:21:35,194 --> 01:21:37,029
Lie down, lie down, lie down.

1364
01:21:37,063 --> 01:21:38,497
You need to rest.

1365
01:21:40,166 --> 01:21:41,233
What happened?

1366
01:21:41,267 --> 01:21:43,535
You had an accident.

1367
01:21:43,569 --> 01:21:45,304
We didn't if the baby was.

1368
01:21:46,505 --> 01:21:49,141
Everything's stable now.

1369
01:21:49,175 --> 01:21:51,510
Honey, you just tripped.

1370
01:21:51,543 --> 01:21:53,512
It could've happened
to any of us.

1371
01:21:53,545 --> 01:21:55,414
No.

1372
01:21:55,447 --> 01:21:56,548
It wasn't an accident.

1373
01:21:56,582 --> 01:21:57,549
It pushed me.

1374
01:21:57,583 --> 01:21:59,251
It pushed me down the stairs.

1375
01:21:59,285 --> 01:22:00,519
You have to believe me, please.

1376
01:22:00,552 --> 01:22:01,453
It pushed me.

1377
01:22:01,487 --> 01:22:03,489
I'm gonna go outside.

1378
01:22:03,522 --> 01:22:06,225
I'm gonna let you two be
alone for just a minute.

1379
01:22:06,258 --> 01:22:07,960
(gasping)

1380
01:22:10,096 --> 01:22:11,630
I'm just so glad you're okay.

1381
01:22:21,507 --> 01:22:22,674
You could've hurt the baby.

1382
01:22:22,708 --> 01:22:23,642
Luke it pushed
me down the stairs.

1383
01:22:23,675 --> 01:22:25,544
We're gonna stay at
Meredith's for a while.

1384
01:22:25,577 --> 01:22:26,678
Luke?

1385
01:22:26,712 --> 01:22:28,080
Why are you doing this?

1386
01:22:30,582 --> 01:22:32,584
You think I did this?

1387
01:22:34,086 --> 01:22:35,721
I don't know what I think.

1388
01:22:36,688 --> 01:22:38,524
I fucked up.

1389
01:22:38,557 --> 01:22:40,592
I made a mistake, I

1390
01:22:40,626 --> 01:22:41,427
I should've gotten you real help

1391
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:42,594
instead of bringing
you down here.

1392
01:22:42,628 --> 01:22:43,662
The house.

1393
01:22:43,695 --> 01:22:45,998
Please, stop.

1394
01:22:46,032 --> 01:22:48,300
Just make it through
this pregnancy.

1395
01:22:48,334 --> 01:22:50,069
For me, that's all I'm asking.

1396
01:22:50,102 --> 01:22:52,038
Make it through this
pregnancy, we could

1397
01:22:53,139 --> 01:22:54,973
we could figure
things out after that.

1398
01:22:58,744 --> 01:23:01,213
I know it's hard.

1399
01:23:01,247 --> 01:23:02,681
But I really think that

1400
01:23:02,714 --> 01:23:04,550
once you'll see the baby
you'll fall in love.

1401
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:06,552
Everything will make sense.

1402
01:23:06,585 --> 01:23:08,120
You'll see.

1403
01:23:09,221 --> 01:23:11,557
Why don't you care?

1404
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:14,660
Because this isn't
about you anymore.

1405
01:23:14,693 --> 01:23:16,028
It's about what's
best for this family,

1406
01:23:16,062 --> 01:23:18,230
what's best for us.

1407
01:23:18,264 --> 01:23:20,432
And if you really think you
can get me back to Chicago

1408
01:23:20,466 --> 01:23:24,170
with ghosts and mediums and
falling down the stairs,

1409
01:23:24,203 --> 01:23:26,472
let me just remind you that
you got me out of Chicago,

1410
01:23:26,505 --> 01:23:28,407
when you tried to give
yourself an abortion.

1411
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,275
But I didn't do it.

1412
01:23:29,308 --> 01:23:31,277
But you would have.

1413
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:32,578
If I hadn't walked
into that room,

1414
01:23:32,611 --> 01:23:34,313
you would have.

1415
01:23:35,714 --> 01:23:37,516
And really, there's not a lot
more in the way of scaring me

1416
01:23:37,549 --> 01:23:39,651
that you can do.

1417
01:23:39,685 --> 01:23:41,420
So just drop it.

1418
01:23:41,453 --> 01:23:42,821
Stop wasting your time and mine

1419
01:23:42,854 --> 01:23:44,790
and start making this work.

1420
01:23:55,101 --> 01:23:57,303
(dark, ominous music)

1421
01:24:12,418 --> 01:24:13,419
The crib?

1422
01:24:13,452 --> 01:24:14,753
It's nothing.

1423
01:24:14,786 --> 01:24:15,521
But she doesn't need.

1424
01:24:15,554 --> 01:24:16,622
Just in case.

1425
01:24:16,655 --> 01:24:18,424
Nothing to worry about.

1426
01:24:19,691 --> 01:24:20,626
We're moving back.

1427
01:24:20,659 --> 01:24:22,228
Just rest.

1428
01:24:35,607 --> 01:24:37,609
(wind rustling)

1429
01:24:39,645 --> 01:24:41,513
(scraping)

1430
01:25:05,904 --> 01:25:07,806
(splashing)

1431
01:25:32,831 --> 01:25:35,133
(whimpering, screaming)

1432
01:25:36,768 --> 01:25:38,804
(clinking)

1433
01:26:00,326 --> 01:26:02,561
(chomping)

1434
01:26:13,472 --> 01:26:14,773
Jenny?

1435
01:26:14,806 --> 01:26:16,642
You should eat your
food, it's getting cold.

1436
01:26:18,944 --> 01:26:20,812
Jenny, you're biting
your nails again.

1437
01:26:25,817 --> 01:26:26,585
Are you feeling?

1438
01:26:26,618 --> 01:26:28,654
She's just tired.

1439
01:26:28,687 --> 01:26:30,356
Drink your tea, sweety.

1440
01:26:47,005 --> 01:26:50,442
So, Luke, when're you
moving into your new office?

1441
01:26:53,712 --> 01:26:54,980
New office?

1442
01:26:55,013 --> 01:26:56,682
For the promotion.

1443
01:26:56,715 --> 01:26:57,949
Promotion?

1444
01:26:57,983 --> 01:26:58,750
Look.

1445
01:26:58,784 --> 01:26:59,951
What promotion?

1446
01:26:59,985 --> 01:27:00,619
I was waiting
for the right time.

1447
01:27:00,652 --> 01:27:01,720
We're leaving.

1448
01:27:01,753 --> 01:27:02,721
Maybe this isn't the
right time to discuss this.

1449
01:27:02,754 --> 01:27:03,655
Aren't we?

1450
01:27:06,925 --> 01:27:08,327
No.

1451
01:27:09,661 --> 01:27:11,397
I told them I'm
staying on, Jenny.

1452
01:27:18,904 --> 01:27:20,306
I like it here.

1453
01:27:20,339 --> 01:27:21,807
I have friends here.

1454
01:27:22,974 --> 01:27:24,743
And you know it's not the
perfect situation for me either

1455
01:27:24,776 --> 01:27:26,412
but I'm making it work.

1456
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,716
I really think we could
have a good life here

1457
01:27:30,749 --> 01:27:31,983
if you just give it a chance.

1458
01:27:32,017 --> 01:27:32,918
You didn't think
this was something

1459
01:27:32,951 --> 01:27:34,653
you should've discussed with me?

1460
01:27:34,686 --> 01:27:35,887
We decided it would be best.

1461
01:27:35,921 --> 01:27:37,789
We?

1462
01:27:37,823 --> 01:27:40,926
Luke and I discussed what
would be best for the baby.

1463
01:27:40,959 --> 01:27:43,295
A stable environment.

1464
01:27:43,329 --> 01:27:44,029
Just for a couple of years.

1465
01:27:44,062 --> 01:27:45,664
Just until things settle down.

1466
01:27:45,697 --> 01:27:46,998
Then we can.

1467
01:27:48,834 --> 01:27:50,302
I'm feeling tired.

1468
01:27:50,336 --> 01:27:50,836
I'm gonna go lie down.

1469
01:27:50,869 --> 01:27:51,570
I'll come.

1470
01:27:51,603 --> 01:27:52,438
No.

1471
01:27:52,471 --> 01:27:53,905
I'll be fine on my own.

1472
01:28:00,879 --> 01:28:01,847
[Voiceover] Hello?

1473
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:02,648
I'm coming to Chicago.

1474
01:28:02,681 --> 01:28:03,315
[Voiceover] What?

1475
01:28:03,349 --> 01:28:04,049
Jennifer, no.

1476
01:28:04,082 --> 01:28:04,983
You shouldn't be going anywhere,

1477
01:28:05,016 --> 01:28:06,418
I thought that you guys said.

1478
01:28:06,452 --> 01:28:07,018
I'm grabbing a few
things and driving up.

1479
01:28:07,052 --> 01:28:07,953
If you'll have me great

1480
01:28:07,986 --> 01:28:08,954
if not I'll find somewhere else.

1481
01:28:10,722 --> 01:28:12,958
I just called to let you know.

1482
01:28:12,991 --> 01:28:15,293
(birds chirping)

1483
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:20,332
(thudding)

1484
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:43,855
(creaking)

1485
01:28:50,896 --> 01:28:52,364
(screaming)

1486
01:28:54,766 --> 01:28:56,368
(buzzing)

1487
01:28:57,769 --> 01:28:58,537
(beep)

1488
01:28:58,570 --> 01:28:59,471
Luke?

1489
01:28:59,505 --> 01:29:00,406
[Voiceover] Where are you?

1490
01:29:00,439 --> 01:29:01,673
It trapped me in the bedroom.

1491
01:29:01,707 --> 01:29:02,608
[Voiceover] God
damn it, Jennifer.

1492
01:29:02,641 --> 01:29:03,409
There's something in the hall.

1493
01:29:03,442 --> 01:29:04,009
I have to get help.

1494
01:29:04,042 --> 01:29:05,377
I have to get help.

1495
01:29:05,411 --> 01:29:06,111
[Voiceover]
Jennifer, calm down

1496
01:29:06,144 --> 01:29:06,978
you have to calm down, okay?

1497
01:29:07,012 --> 01:29:07,646
(groaning)

1498
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:08,814
Jennifer?

1499
01:29:08,847 --> 01:29:10,449
I think I'm
having contractions.

1500
01:29:10,482 --> 01:29:11,417
[Voiceover] What?

1501
01:29:11,450 --> 01:29:13,452
(panting)

1502
01:29:15,621 --> 01:29:17,022
The baby's coming.

1503
01:29:18,657 --> 01:29:19,925
[Voiceover] Alright,
honey listen, I'm on my way.

1504
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:22,561
The baby's going
to come, calm down.

1505
01:29:22,594 --> 01:29:24,129
You're going to hurt him
if you're not careful.

1506
01:29:25,797 --> 01:29:27,433
Jennifer you need
to get outside.

1507
01:29:27,466 --> 01:29:28,934
No.

1508
01:29:28,967 --> 01:29:30,402
[Voiceover] Jennifer, please.

1509
01:29:30,436 --> 01:29:31,603
Take a deep breath, okay?

1510
01:29:31,637 --> 01:29:33,104
I'm coming, you
need to get outside.

1511
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:35,841
I can't.

1512
01:29:35,874 --> 01:29:36,775
(sighing)

1513
01:29:36,808 --> 01:29:37,709
[Voiceover] You can alright?

1514
01:29:37,743 --> 01:29:38,977
There's nothing in the hall.

1515
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:40,779
Jennifer, there never
has been, alright?

1516
01:29:40,812 --> 01:29:42,648
You're sick, honey.

1517
01:29:42,681 --> 01:29:44,182
Alright I'm sorry.

1518
01:29:44,215 --> 01:29:45,517
Okay, I really am, I'm sorry.

1519
01:29:45,551 --> 01:29:47,653
But this is all in your head.

1520
01:29:47,686 --> 01:29:49,721
Aright, you have to
believe me Jennifer.

1521
01:29:49,755 --> 01:29:51,022
Please.

1522
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:54,092
Jennifer?

1523
01:29:54,125 --> 01:29:55,393
Okay.

1524
01:29:56,695 --> 01:29:58,530
[Voiceover] Okay.

1525
01:29:58,564 --> 01:30:00,065
Alright, go to the door.

1526
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:04,035
(panting, snifling)

1527
01:30:11,877 --> 01:30:13,111
I'm there.

1528
01:30:13,144 --> 01:30:14,646
[Voiceover]
Alright, good, good.

1529
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,181
Alright, now close your eyes.

1530
01:30:17,248 --> 01:30:18,984
My eyes are closed.

1531
01:30:19,017 --> 01:30:20,952
[Voiceover] Alright,
great, that's great.

1532
01:30:20,986 --> 01:30:22,120
Alright, now open it.

1533
01:30:22,153 --> 01:30:22,788
Don't.

1534
01:30:22,821 --> 01:30:23,722
(whimpering)

1535
01:30:23,755 --> 01:30:24,523
[Voiceover] Jennifer, you can.

1536
01:30:24,556 --> 01:30:26,057
Alright honey, listen.

1537
01:30:26,091 --> 01:30:26,925
Listen to when I say this,

1538
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:28,460
there's nothing
out there, alright?

1539
01:30:28,494 --> 01:30:29,194
I promise, there's
nothing there.

1540
01:30:29,227 --> 01:30:30,496
Say it.

1541
01:30:30,529 --> 01:30:31,663
There's nothing there.

1542
01:30:31,697 --> 01:30:32,598
There's nothing there.

1543
01:30:32,631 --> 01:30:33,198
There's nothing there.

1544
01:30:33,231 --> 01:30:34,132
[Voiceover] Okay.

1545
01:30:34,165 --> 01:30:35,934
Alright honey, open the door.

1546
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,809
Alright, open your eyes.

1547
01:30:43,842 --> 01:30:46,111
On the count of three.

1548
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,613
One.

1549
01:30:47,646 --> 01:30:48,780
Two.

1550
01:30:48,814 --> 01:30:49,481
Three.

1551
01:30:49,515 --> 01:30:50,882
(gasping)

1552
01:30:55,053 --> 01:30:57,188
Everything okay?

1553
01:30:57,222 --> 01:30:58,857
Yeah.

1554
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:00,058
I'm fine.

1555
01:31:00,091 --> 01:31:01,827
[Voiceover]
Anything out there?

1556
01:31:03,228 --> 01:31:04,730
No.

1557
01:31:05,564 --> 01:31:06,832
It's empty.

1558
01:31:06,865 --> 01:31:07,866
[Voiceover] Alright just

1559
01:31:07,899 --> 01:31:09,568
just go downstairs and outside.

1560
01:31:09,601 --> 01:31:10,836
I'll be there soon.

1561
01:31:10,869 --> 01:31:11,870
Okay.

1562
01:31:23,148 --> 01:31:25,684
(dark, menacing music)

1563
01:31:25,717 --> 01:31:27,085
No.

1564
01:31:28,153 --> 01:31:30,088
No.

1565
01:31:30,121 --> 01:31:32,190
(screaming)

1566
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,762
(groaning, whimpering)

1567
01:31:45,937 --> 01:31:47,272
(banging)

1568
01:31:48,339 --> 01:31:51,209
(baby crying, buzzing)

1569
01:31:59,851 --> 01:32:00,786
There's nothing there

1570
01:32:00,819 --> 01:32:01,787
There's nothing there.

1571
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:02,788
There's nothing there.

1572
01:32:02,821 --> 01:32:03,655
There's nothing there.

1573
01:32:03,689 --> 01:32:04,590
There's nothing there.

1574
01:32:04,623 --> 01:32:05,190
There's nothing.

1575
01:32:05,223 --> 01:32:07,058
There's nothing,

1576
01:32:07,092 --> 01:32:08,594
nothing there.

1577
01:32:14,299 --> 01:32:16,267
(screaming)

1578
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:28,279
Stop.

1579
01:32:29,881 --> 01:32:31,917
(thudding)

1580
01:32:31,950 --> 01:32:34,019
(panting)

1581
01:33:08,754 --> 01:33:11,189
(breathing soundly)

1582
01:33:43,088 --> 01:33:45,356
(light, melodious music)

1583
01:34:02,407 --> 01:34:04,142
You wanna show him his room?

1584
01:34:05,944 --> 01:34:07,245
Sure.

1585
01:35:12,443 --> 01:35:13,278
(creaking)

1586
01:35:13,311 --> 01:35:14,712
(gasping)

1587
01:35:49,981 --> 01:35:51,482
Jennifer.

1588
01:35:53,919 --> 01:35:55,120
Pardon my mess.

1589
01:35:55,153 --> 01:35:58,056
I'm not accustomed to
having much company.

1590
01:36:07,365 --> 01:36:09,935
I'm sorry for how I acted.

1591
01:36:09,968 --> 01:36:10,501
For what I said.

1592
01:36:10,535 --> 01:36:11,970
Please.

1593
01:36:12,003 --> 01:36:14,172
We're both adults, no
need for pleasantries.

1594
01:36:15,373 --> 01:36:16,875
What can I do for you?

1595
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:20,211
Luke and my mom are telling me

1596
01:36:20,245 --> 01:36:23,348
that the pregnancy
was too much for me.

1597
01:36:23,381 --> 01:36:26,284
At this point, I'm
willing to accept that.

1598
01:36:26,317 --> 01:36:28,920
But they're just a few things
that keep nagging at me.

1599
01:36:31,322 --> 01:36:33,258
You saw something.

1600
01:36:33,291 --> 01:36:34,259
Didn't you?

1601
01:36:34,292 --> 01:36:35,093
Right be fore you left.

1602
01:36:35,126 --> 01:36:36,361
No.

1603
01:36:37,395 --> 01:36:38,496
I saw your face.

1604
01:36:38,529 --> 01:36:39,931
No.

1605
01:36:39,965 --> 01:36:42,467
I didn't see anything.

1606
01:36:43,902 --> 01:36:46,204
Something started to make
sense to me that's all.

1607
01:36:47,138 --> 01:36:48,539
What?

1608
01:36:51,042 --> 01:36:52,577
I don't believe
in God, Jennifer.

1609
01:36:52,610 --> 01:36:55,881
I don't believe in
life after death.

1610
01:36:57,048 --> 01:36:59,985
And if you pressed me,
I'd have to admit I

1611
01:37:00,018 --> 01:37:02,420
don't believe in ghosts either.

1612
01:37:02,453 --> 01:37:04,956
At least not the way they're
generally understood.

1613
01:37:06,524 --> 01:37:09,560
Stopped believing
all of that after

1614
01:37:09,594 --> 01:37:11,396
Charlie died.

1615
01:37:11,429 --> 01:37:13,131
'Cause I knew that if
there was an afterlife,

1616
01:37:13,164 --> 01:37:15,901
if there was any way possible,

1617
01:37:15,934 --> 01:37:17,468
he would contact me.

1618
01:37:18,669 --> 01:37:20,605
And he didn't.

1619
01:37:20,638 --> 01:37:23,408
He hasn't, not once
in over 20 years.

1620
01:37:24,375 --> 01:37:25,911
And how I tried.

1621
01:37:33,484 --> 01:37:35,186
But you said you pick up on.

1622
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:36,221
Energies.

1623
01:37:36,254 --> 01:37:37,588
Yes.

1624
01:37:37,622 --> 01:37:39,624
But just that.

1625
01:37:42,327 --> 01:37:45,596
It's a lot less romantic
than ghosts, isn't it?

1626
01:37:45,630 --> 01:37:49,067
It's a lot less comforting too.

1627
01:37:50,201 --> 01:37:52,603
But that's all I was
ever able to pick up on.

1628
01:37:53,571 --> 01:37:56,441
I don't think there
is anything else.

1629
01:37:56,474 --> 01:37:58,643
Well if you don't think it
was a ghost then what was it?

1630
01:37:58,676 --> 01:37:59,577
You

1631
01:37:59,610 --> 01:38:02,047
have an energy, Jennifer.

1632
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,015
I'm picking up on it right now.

1633
01:38:04,049 --> 01:38:06,617
You're afraid, frustrated.

1634
01:38:06,651 --> 01:38:08,219
I feel that.

1635
01:38:08,253 --> 01:38:10,621
And whether you're
aware of it or not,

1636
01:38:10,655 --> 01:38:12,490
it's bumping up
against my energy.

1637
01:38:12,523 --> 01:38:14,659
It's physically affecting
me, energy does that.

1638
01:38:16,127 --> 01:38:19,931
Well places, have
energies too, Jennifer.

1639
01:38:19,965 --> 01:38:21,532
Houses even.

1640
01:38:21,566 --> 01:38:24,035
And they're affected
in just the same way.

1641
01:38:25,336 --> 01:38:27,372
Let's say you go
into a place that

1642
01:38:28,539 --> 01:38:31,142
has a lot of energy
hanging around it.

1643
01:38:32,077 --> 01:38:33,678
Your house, say.

1644
01:38:33,711 --> 01:38:36,214
If you go into a place like that

1645
01:38:36,247 --> 01:38:38,249
and you're going
through something,

1646
01:38:38,283 --> 01:38:42,954
stress, anger, lot of
sorrow, regret, anything.

1647
01:38:44,122 --> 01:38:47,092
Well all that energy
you're pouring out

1648
01:38:47,125 --> 01:38:50,495
is going to bump up against the
energy that's already there.

1649
01:38:50,528 --> 01:38:52,297
It's gonna rough it up, you see.

1650
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:54,365
Mess with it.

1651
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:56,067
And then,

1652
01:38:56,101 --> 01:38:59,504
that energy that was
there is going to change.

1653
01:38:59,537 --> 01:39:01,239
It's going to react.

1654
01:39:03,674 --> 01:39:05,243
I'm not saying that's exactly

1655
01:39:05,276 --> 01:39:07,045
what's happening in your house.

1656
01:39:08,179 --> 01:39:09,514
But I am saying
that we often forget

1657
01:39:09,547 --> 01:39:13,284
that we're constantly
affecting everything around us.

1658
01:39:13,318 --> 01:39:16,121
People, environments,

1659
01:39:17,188 --> 01:39:19,490
old houses in Kansas.

1660
01:39:21,592 --> 01:39:23,494
You're saying,

1661
01:39:26,231 --> 01:39:27,598
you think this was all my fault.

1662
01:39:27,632 --> 01:39:29,467
You wanted my
opinion, there it is.

1663
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:30,668
There's got to be
another explanation.

1664
01:39:30,701 --> 01:39:32,070
There's,

1665
01:39:32,103 --> 01:39:33,138
there's something else,
I won't except that.

1666
01:39:33,171 --> 01:39:34,572
Of course not.

1667
01:39:34,605 --> 01:39:36,607
You're too blinded by
your search to find

1668
01:39:36,641 --> 01:39:39,577
something or someone else
to blame, aren't you?

1669
01:39:39,610 --> 01:39:42,147
Well there are things much
bigger than us, Jennifer.

1670
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:44,549
Things that aren't so
easily categorized or

1671
01:39:44,582 --> 01:39:46,551
or controlled.

1672
01:39:46,584 --> 01:39:48,419
You might have
better luck if you

1673
01:39:48,453 --> 01:39:49,787
stopped trying to
push everything

1674
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:51,256
the way you want it to go

1675
01:39:51,289 --> 01:39:53,691
and started looking
at the source.

1676
01:39:56,127 --> 01:39:57,695
You don't know
anything about me.

1677
01:39:57,728 --> 01:40:00,065
Oh, but I do, my dear.

1678
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:05,136
You moved into that
house and you hated it.

1679
01:40:05,803 --> 01:40:07,205
You hated this town,

1680
01:40:07,238 --> 01:40:08,706
you hated your mother.

1681
01:40:08,739 --> 01:40:10,375
You hated your husband
for bringing you here.

1682
01:40:10,408 --> 01:40:12,110
And most of all,

1683
01:40:12,143 --> 01:40:14,412
you hated that baby inside you

1684
01:40:14,445 --> 01:40:16,481
and what it did to
your perfect life.

1685
01:40:17,615 --> 01:40:19,250
From all I can see,

1686
01:40:19,284 --> 01:40:21,252
you've done nothing but hate.

1687
01:40:22,287 --> 01:40:24,155
Are you really
surprised that the house

1688
01:40:24,189 --> 01:40:27,125
started to hate back?

1689
01:40:27,158 --> 01:40:28,393
I shouldn't have come to you.

1690
01:40:28,426 --> 01:40:29,627
I should've known
you wouldn't help.

1691
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:31,429
What're you even doing here?

1692
01:40:31,462 --> 01:40:33,598
Still in this town?

1693
01:40:33,631 --> 01:40:35,133
Now that everything is settled,

1694
01:40:35,166 --> 01:40:37,235
now that the baby is born,

1695
01:40:37,268 --> 01:40:38,169
I don't understand,

1696
01:40:38,203 --> 01:40:39,737
why don't you just leave?

1697
01:40:43,541 --> 01:40:46,177
[Jennifer] Believe
me that's all I want.

1698
01:40:47,612 --> 01:40:49,614
Then what's stopping you?

1699
01:40:55,820 --> 01:40:57,722
(creaking)

1700
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,469
(thudding)

1701
01:41:13,604 --> 01:41:14,772
Hello?

1702
01:41:18,609 --> 01:41:20,178
Jennifer?

1703
01:41:54,612 --> 01:41:55,880
(buzzing)

1704
01:42:01,852 --> 01:42:02,753
Hey.

1705
01:42:02,787 --> 01:42:05,122
(frequency disturbance)

1706
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:17,402
Luke.

1707
01:42:18,536 --> 01:42:20,671
(baby crying)

1708
01:42:23,774 --> 01:42:24,942
Luke?

1709
01:42:24,975 --> 01:42:26,477
Luke?

1710
01:42:28,546 --> 01:42:29,680
Luke?

1711
01:42:34,819 --> 01:42:36,554
Luke?

1712
01:42:36,587 --> 01:42:37,755
Luke?

1713
01:42:40,758 --> 01:42:43,528
(dark, menacing music)

1714
01:44:09,013 --> 01:44:11,849
(car rumbling)

1715
01:44:25,663 --> 01:44:28,032
(whimpering)

1716
01:44:43,514 --> 01:44:45,616
Grandma's gonna
miss you so much.

1717
01:44:53,491 --> 01:44:55,626
Are you sure this is
the right thing to do?

1718
01:44:57,061 --> 01:44:58,996
If you live closer I could
help you take care of Tyler.

1719
01:45:01,098 --> 01:45:02,733
Take care of you.

1720
01:45:08,773 --> 01:45:10,875
Plan was always to
go back to Chicago.

1721
01:45:13,744 --> 01:45:14,979
Your plan.

1722
01:45:17,081 --> 01:45:19,950
Well, I'm happy for you.

1723
01:45:22,052 --> 01:45:24,054
At least you're getting
what you wanted.

1724
01:45:52,082 --> 01:45:54,719
(engine revving)

1725
01:46:34,124 --> 01:46:36,927
(baby crying)

1726
01:48:17,194 --> 01:48:17,261
(enigmatic, melodious music)
