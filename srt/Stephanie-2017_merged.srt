1
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,358
Well, I was...

2
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:56,926
I just wanted to see
how it ends.

3
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,147
So, you're the brave one.

4
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,149
- I guess.
- It's good.

5
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:04,151
It'll carry well down there.

6
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:36,068
A little help here, Francis.

7
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:37,157
Come on.

8
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:01,442
Not quite it, Francis.

9
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:03,661
Just not quite it.

10
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,330
Francis! Look what you did!

11
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,404
Bad turtles
don't get smoothies.

12
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:15,342
Come on...

13
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

14
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,985
Stop!

15
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:52,509
It's not funny.

16
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:54,337
Stop it!

17
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:22,496
This is good,
if I do say so myself.

18
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:41,428
Ow.

19
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:45,606
Ow.

20
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:53,048
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

21
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:20,222
The end is kind of sad.

22
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:22,267
Are you sure
you wanna hear this?

23
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:24,792
Okay.

24
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:26,315
"Once upon a time,

25
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,535
there was a unicorn
named Eleanor.

26
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:30,275
She wasn't like
the other unicorns

27
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,278
because she had two horns.

28
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:36,151
There's the wizard,

29
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:37,500
he says he can help her,

30
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:39,197
but only if she finds

31
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:40,416
someone else like her.

32
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,809
So she wanders around

33
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:43,027
until she finds a knight

34
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,507
who's stuck in a tree.

35
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:45,769
He's lonely, too,

36
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:48,337
and his name is Francis.

37
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,559
And they go back to the wizard

38
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:54,778
so he can make her normal.

39
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,215
But then the wizard says

40
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:58,782
that she's better than normal,

41
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:00,741
she's special.

42
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,307
And now that
she has another friend,

43
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:03,961
she's not lonely."

44
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,528
And that's it. The end.

45
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:08,792
But it doesn't make sense.

46
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:11,534
That's not even what she wanted.

47
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:12,579
See?

48
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,145
Told you it was sad.

49
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,545
I want Mommy and Daddy.

50
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,776
No peeking, okay?

51
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:43,523
One alligator,

52
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:44,872
two alligator,

53
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,264
three alligator,

54
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,223

00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:52,183
six alligator,

57
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:55,012
seven alligator,

58
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:56,797
eight alligator,

59
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,712
nine alligator,

60
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,365
ten alligator,

61
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:01,802
eleven alligator,

62
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:03,325
twelve alligator,

63
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:05,196
thirteen alligator,

64
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,983
fourteen alligator,

00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:10,985
fifteen alligator,

66
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:15,293
sixteen alligator,

67
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:17,339
seventeen alligator,

68
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,341
eighteen alligator,

69
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:20,951
nineteen alligator...

70
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,869
twenty alligator...

71
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,527
twenty-one alligator,

72
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,922
twenty-two alligator.

73
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:37,011
Okay, Francis, I'm here.

74
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:39,187
Come find me!

75
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

76
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,264
Go away. Please, go away!

77
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:15,440
Go away.

78
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:23,073
It came back.

79
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,730
See that?

80
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:29,514
That's where it lives.

81
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,647
Out past the trees.

82
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:35,999
When the monster comes,

83
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:37,348
you have to stay calm.

84
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:39,524
You can't even think
bad thoughts.

85
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:42,397
If it hears you,
it gets super angry.

86
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:52,015
Don't worry,
I won't let him get you.

87
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,148
You have to do what I say,

88
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,889
because I'm your mommy.

89
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,674
That means I'll always
take care of you,

90
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,242
and never go away
and leave you.

91
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,816
Come on, Francis,
kick it back.

92
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:13,515
Don't be a loser.

93
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:16,736
Oh, Mr. Hopper!

94
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:19,173
I'll be right back.

95
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:43,501
Shoot!

96
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:49,029
Shit!

97
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,163
Shit-ass! Shit!

98
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,078
Shit-ass, shit-ass,
shit-ass, shit!

99
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:56,993
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

100
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:59,779
Shit!

101
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,650
Shit-ass!

102
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,217
Shit!

103
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,436
Ass!

104
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:10,615
Shit-ass, shit,

105
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,878
shit, shit, shit.

106
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,009
Shit-ass, shit,

107
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:14,358
shit, shit, shit.

108
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:15,403
Shit-ass, shit,

109
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:16,883
shit, shit, shit.

110
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:21,191
Mr. Hopper...

111
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,629
I made you lunch.

112
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,851
Why don't you come back home?

113
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,027
We miss you.

114
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:33,900
Me and Francis.

115
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:35,815
Aw.

116
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,297
You just enjoy

117
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:44,127
the nice cup of tomato sauce.

118
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:46,913
No! Wait!

119
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:48,001
Wait, stop.

120
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,089
Come to Mommy.

121
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,307
Stop.

122
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:56,096
Stay.

123
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,402
Stay.

124
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:01,884
Now, come back.

125
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,712
Come here, Mr. Hopper.

126
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:06,106
Wait!

127
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:08,151
Don't go in there!

128
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:09,979
Please come back.

129
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,509
Don't leave me.

130
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

131
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

132
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,473
Ugh.

133
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,134
Ugh.

134
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,405
Sorry, I'm sorry.

135
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:13,015
I shouldn't have brought
you a pumpkin.

136
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,974
It was stupid, it's just...

137
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,323
they get rotten so fast

138
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:18,281
and you never got to finish it.

139
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:22,155
So, don't be mad.

140
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,373
Okay?

141
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:25,854
Paul?

142
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:39,128
The monster's back.

143
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,922
Your fingers are cold.

144
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,622
Let me sleep here.

145
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,625
Those outside
the hot-zones are required

146
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:42,757
to remain in their homes

147
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,367
while quarantine is in effect.

148
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:45,760
Airports are closed.

149
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:47,414
No unauthorized travel
is allowed to...

150
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:49,590
Containment
facilities are being

151
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:50,939
constructed around the country

152
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:52,288
and authorities are cautioning

153
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:55,030
that citizens
should not approach

154
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,249
this new...

155
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:13,004
There you are, Francis.

156
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,659
The guests will arrive shortly.

157
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,883
Well, you look marvelous.

158
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:24,103
You're marvelous, Ma...

159
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,542
I must compliment you

160
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:31,284
on your taste
of horn decorations.

161
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:32,981
Have you met Sir Francis?

162
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:36,724
He's a very famous explorer,
you know.

163
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:39,205
And he's not even afraid
of the dark.

164
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:40,858
At all.

165
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:44,819
If only we had Mr. Hopper.

166
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,307
Stay there.

167
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:03,229
Francis, did you do that?

168
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:18,157
Francis?

169
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

170
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:05,465
You were supposed
to take care of me!

171
00:20:05,508 --> 00:20:06,553
That's your job!

172
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:08,250
Dad says you're the big brother

173
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:09,860
and you take care
of Stephanie.

174
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:11,122
It's your fault.

175
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,081
They left because of you!

176
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:15,910
They'd still be here
if you hadn't died!

177
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:18,304
It's your fault!

178
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:54,764
Okay, you stay there.

179
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:56,026
You can do this.

180
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,464
Keep a lookout
for anything weird.

181
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:01,118
I believe in you.

182
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:04,383
I'll only take a minute.

183
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

184
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:32,313
Did you hear that?

185
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:36,273
Shh...

186
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

187
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,075
Oh, my God.

188
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,296
Stephanie.

189
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:10,819
Daddy!

190
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:13,256
- Come here, baby.
- Come here, baby.

191
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,997
I got you.

192
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,696
Yeah.

193
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,698
I got you.
I got you, princess.

194
00:28:21,395 --> 00:28:23,179
We're here.

195
00:28:23,223 --> 00:28:24,311
Let me see your face.

196
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:25,486
Let me see you.

197
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:26,879
You okay?

198
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:28,358
Yeah?

199
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:30,012
Look at you.

200
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:31,274
You're okay.

201
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:33,015
My princess.

202
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:36,062
That's my girl.

203
00:28:36,105 --> 00:28:37,716
I'm sorry.

204
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,764
I got ya.

205
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:44,331
Come on, baby.

206
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,637
Paul?

207
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:33,342
How are you gonna find
your way home?

208
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,189
Stephanie.

209
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:55,451
Sweetheart! Stephanie!

210
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,149
- Steph!
- Stephanie!

211
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:02,110
Stephanie!

212
00:33:02,154 --> 00:33:03,677
Steph!

213
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:11,032
Stephanie! You are not to leave
our sight, young lady!

214
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:12,164
Don't.

215
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:13,992
- She needs to listen.
- I said, don't.

216
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,908
Stay calm.

217
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:19,693
Both of you.

218
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:23,262
Baby, it's really dangerous
for you to be out there, okay?

219
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:28,049
Why did you take Paul away?

220
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:30,573
I want him to come home.

221
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,347
Hi, princess.

222
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:06,566
Hi, Daddy.

223
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,831
- I'm gonna make us breakfast.
- Okay.

224
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:13,790
Did you sleep well?

225
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:15,227
Mm-hmm.

226
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:18,621
The lights are back on.

227
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:20,232
Yeah. Your, um,

228
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:22,321
your father messed
with the breaker.

229
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:23,757
More?

230
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,063
Mm-hmm.

231
00:34:26,412 --> 00:34:28,718
What's he building?

232
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:30,155
Oh, you know your dad.

233
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:32,983
He would rebuild
the Panama Canal if he could.

234
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:38,685
Why did you leave me?

235
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:49,304
Stephanie,
you have to understand

236
00:34:49,348 --> 00:34:50,653
that your dad and me,

237
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:54,701
we never would have left you
here alone if...

238
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,137
We thought that...

239
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:58,705
You thought
that the monster got me, too.

240
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:03,884
Yeah.

241
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:06,278
It still comes
sniffing around.

242
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:09,194
It's in the woods.

243
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:10,934
But if we get upset,

244
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:12,806
it comes into the house.

245
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:15,417
What do you do then,
when it comes in the house?

246
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:17,115
We get totally quiet.

247
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:20,292
Me and Francis are aces
at hiding from it.

248
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:22,946
Aces.

249
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,165
Mm-hmm.

250
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:28,126
Steph, you're one tough kid,
you know that?

251
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,563
Not really.

252
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:35,133
Really, I'm pretty scared.

253
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:03,161
What do you think?

254
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:05,511
For the monster?

255
00:36:05,554 --> 00:36:06,860
Yes.

256
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,299
Do you think it's strong
enough to keep it out?

257
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:18,132
Well,

258
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,786
it's pretty good anyway.

259
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:22,615
Thanks.

260
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:24,399
I think so, too.

261
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:26,358
I like it
when you build stuff.

262
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:27,837
Is that so?

263
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,361
Mm-hmm.

264
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,670
Can I ask you a question?

265
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:36,455
Sure.

266
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:39,284
What happened to Mr. Hopper?

267
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:43,288
Well, he...

268
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:44,506
Honey!

269
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,552
Can you come inside
for a minute?

270
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:48,249
Yeah.

271
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:51,948
You stay here.

272
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:54,299
Clear.

273
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:55,430
Clear?

274
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:57,563
Crystal.

275
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:03,177
You stay here.

276
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,310
Clear?

277
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:08,313
Clear? Okay.

278
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:21,543
So what's Atlanta
saying about the new protocols?

279
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:23,980
The CDC
has no comment at this time.

280
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:26,026
You've seen the news.

281
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:28,289
The president...
is weighing all options.

282
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,770
There are rumors online
that they've had some success

283
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:33,033
at the containment facility
in Mumbai.

284
00:37:33,076 --> 00:37:35,731
Yeah, rumors but...

285
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,733
what's going on?

286
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:40,867
Jane, I've never seen you
like this.

287
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,391
Are Paul and Stephanie okay?

288
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:53,140
It's cool.
It's impossible not to worry

289
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:55,838
about all of our kids.

290
00:37:55,882 --> 00:37:59,494
Look, can you talk me through
the isolation protocol?

291
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:02,671
Three!

292
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:05,108
Two! One! Popcorn!

293
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:07,589
Done! Bam!

294
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,330
Eh-eh-eh!
Eh-eh-eh.

295
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:12,159
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

296
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:13,116
Ah, shit.

297
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,509
- Dad!
- Oh! Sorry.

298
00:38:14,553 --> 00:38:15,989
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

299
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:20,776
Fantastic.

300
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,212
Salt!

301
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:23,562
Good. Taste.

302
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,348
Good.

303
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:28,697
Give me some love.

304
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:34,790
You almost done
with that fence?

305
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:36,662
Probably tomorrow.

306
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:38,751
Good.

307
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:44,626
Ah, so they tell me.

308
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:47,760
Steph, what's Francis doing?

309
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:49,196
Dancing.

310
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:51,503
Oh baby, turtles can't dance.

311
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:53,940
Don't listen to her, Francis.

312
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:56,203
Show her your special dance.

313
00:38:56,246 --> 00:38:57,683
His special... Oh!

314
00:38:57,726 --> 00:38:59,249
Oh!

315
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,643
That is not a special dance!

316
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:03,297
That is tickle!

317
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,342
Oh, Francis,

318
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,691
you're Fran-tastic.

319
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:06,779
I don't get it.

320
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:08,607
I do!

321
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,522
I don't get it.

322
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:14,613
- Francis is Fran-tastic.
- Francis into fantastic.

323
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:16,528
But the word is fantastic.

324
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:19,661
Fantastic. It's not Fran-tastic.

325
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:21,489
It's Fran-tastic.

326
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,767
Be right back.

327
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:40,203
Okay.

328
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:08,623
Why, baby. Why?

329
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,886
It's okay, it's okay.

330
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,801
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

331
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:15,587
I know.
Take your time.

332
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:19,025
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- I got you.

333
00:40:19,068 --> 00:40:21,767
I got you.

334
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:25,248
Come on. Come on.

335
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,227
How did Paul come back?

336
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:57,542
Did the monster bring him?

337
00:40:57,585 --> 00:40:59,587
Yes.

338
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:00,893
Why?

339
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,550
We don't really know why it does
any of the things it does.

340
00:41:08,248 --> 00:41:09,945
Maybe we should leave.

341
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:16,125
I think it would just
come after us, princess.

342
00:41:16,169 --> 00:41:17,997
After me?

343
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,129
Yes.

344
00:41:22,915 --> 00:41:25,221
It wants me, right?

345
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:28,311
That's why
it keeps coming back.

346
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:32,490
Yes.

347
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:37,756
You used to say there's
no such thing as monsters.

348
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:39,671
I know.

349
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:43,936
I'm sorry.

350
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,855
I was wrong.

351
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:54,860
May I be excused?

352
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

353
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,887
Hey, princess.

354
00:44:32,931 --> 00:44:34,367
Hey, Dad.

355
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:38,676
Can we talk?

356
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:43,724
Your mother's sorry
for losing her temper.

357
00:44:43,768 --> 00:44:46,596
- No big deal.
- Mmm, no, it is a big deal.

358
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,337
All of us have to watch

359
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:50,078
what we do, how we feel.

360
00:44:50,122 --> 00:44:52,298
You included.

361
00:44:52,341 --> 00:44:54,082
Because that will make
the monster come.

362
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:56,258
Mm-hmm.

363
00:44:56,302 --> 00:44:59,261
We didn't mean to upset you.

364
00:44:59,305 --> 00:45:01,046
And that's why
we didn't wake you up

365
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:02,438
when we took Paul away.

366
00:45:02,482 --> 00:45:05,224
And maybe that was wrong,
I don't know.

367
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:07,313
Parents aren't perfect.

368
00:45:07,356 --> 00:45:09,054
That's the sad truth.

369
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:14,973
Why did you leave me here?

370
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:23,851
We were afraid, how's that?

371
00:45:23,895 --> 00:45:25,070
I was afraid.

372
00:45:25,113 --> 00:45:27,333
Of what?

373
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:28,726
Don't lie.

374
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:36,211
I was afraid of myself, maybe?

375
00:45:36,255 --> 00:45:38,910
That I wouldn't be strong enough

376
00:45:38,953 --> 00:45:40,128
to take care of the things

377
00:45:40,172 --> 00:45:42,304
that I need to take care of.

378
00:45:42,348 --> 00:45:43,958
What do you need to do?

379
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:45,264
Well, that's the scary part,

380
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:47,701
I'm not quite sure.

381
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,876
Can I help?

382
00:45:50,356 --> 00:45:52,401
Maybe, princess.

383
00:45:54,273 --> 00:45:57,015
You're strong, Stephanie.

384
00:45:57,058 --> 00:46:00,192
I'm talking about
strength up here.

385
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:02,194
Strength on the inside.

386
00:46:02,237 --> 00:46:04,283
Your mommy and me,
we made you.

387
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:06,720
We made your eyes that color

388
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,636
and we made your hair
straight and blonde.

389
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:10,811
That's what we did.

390
00:46:10,855 --> 00:46:13,553
We made everything out here.

391
00:46:13,596 --> 00:46:17,035
But up here, on the inside,
that's all you.

392
00:46:17,078 --> 00:46:18,210
All the way.

393
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:19,559
The good and the bad,

394
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:22,040
that's for you to control.

395
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:23,563
That's for you to change,

396
00:46:23,606 --> 00:46:24,912
if you want to.

397
00:46:24,956 --> 00:46:28,611
The fear and the anger
and the doubt,

398
00:46:28,655 --> 00:46:31,005
they're what call the monster.

399
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:33,616
And when you get those feelings,
the bad feelings,

400
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,010
all you have to do
is make them small.

401
00:46:36,054 --> 00:46:37,838
That's how you beat it.

402
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:39,666
That's the number one rule.

403
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:41,276
Don't let
the bad things get big,

404
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,061
everything will be fine.

405
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:44,453
You get it?

406
00:46:44,497 --> 00:46:46,238
Mm-hmm.

407
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:51,504
Now, I'm betting locked up
inside that head of yours,

408
00:46:51,547 --> 00:46:54,637
you have enough strength
to stop that monster cold.

409
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:05,170
Dunk.

410
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

411
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:20,098
You all right?

412
00:47:20,141 --> 00:47:21,664
Mm-hmm.

413
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:41,641
I love you, Daddy.

414
00:47:54,045 --> 00:47:56,177
She's lived longer
than any of them, right?

415
00:47:56,221 --> 00:47:58,876
Yeah.

416
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:00,921
Do you really believe

417
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:03,097
that she isn't gonna end up
like the rest of them?

418
00:48:03,141 --> 00:48:05,317
I talked to her,
she can keep herself calm.

419
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,362
- She's a tough kid.
- You talked to her.

420
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:09,538
Maybe it is,

421
00:48:09,582 --> 00:48:11,192
I don't know, we don't know.

422
00:48:11,236 --> 00:48:12,454
We have to protect her.

423
00:48:12,498 --> 00:48:13,891
This procedure, I can do it,

424
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:15,675
- I can keep her safe.
- You're not

425
00:48:15,718 --> 00:48:17,459
that kind of doctor,
it's too dangerous,

426
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:20,114
the procedure could kill her.

427
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:22,725
The best thing to do
right now is we just wait.

428
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:24,336
That's all I'm asking you
to do is wait.

429
00:48:24,379 --> 00:48:26,164
- Wait for what?
- What if she can't?

430
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:27,817
You've seen
what those things can do.

431
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:30,342
Yeah. I've seen it,
in my house.

432
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

433
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:16,910
Mom?

434
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,129
Dad?

435
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Mom?
Dad?

436
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

437
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Daddy?

438
00:50:40,602 --> 00:50:41,734
Daddy!

439
00:50:41,777 --> 00:50:43,170
Hi, princess.

440
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:48,235
Mom?

441
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:49,584
Dad?

442
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No!

443
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,912
Steph!

444
00:52:12,955 --> 00:52:15,480
All right, take it easy,
she's fine, she's fine.

445
00:52:15,523 --> 00:52:18,700
Look at me,
you got to stay calm. Okay?

446
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:19,701
The monster killed you.

447
00:52:19,745 --> 00:52:21,094
Nobody killed me.

448
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,009
Listen to me, baby,
you got to stay calm.

449
00:52:23,052 --> 00:52:24,663
No, Daddy, the basement.

450
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:29,146
Run!

451
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:33,150
- Daddy! Dad!
- Shh! Shh, shh...

452
00:52:33,193 --> 00:52:34,934
Daddy!

453
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:51,211
All right, it's okay.

454
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:53,822
It's okay. It's okay.

455
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:56,042
Shh! We have to be quiet.

456
00:52:56,085 --> 00:52:58,175
The monster might hear us.

457
00:53:41,914 --> 00:53:43,655
We did it.

458
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come on, it's clear.

459
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:23,347
Mom!

460
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:47,458
Ow. Ow.

461
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,636
Francis.

462
00:55:00,035 --> 00:55:02,516
Stephanie! Wait!

463
00:55:10,132 --> 00:55:11,612
Stephanie!

464
00:55:26,235 --> 00:55:28,107
The monster!

465
00:55:30,588 --> 00:55:31,545
The monster! The monster!

466
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:33,808
I'm sorry.

467
00:55:33,852 --> 00:55:35,375
I'm sorry, it's you.

468
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:37,246
It's you.

469
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,949
The monster is you.

470
00:56:33,955 --> 00:56:36,393
Baby, how'd you sleep?

471
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:38,133
I had a weird dream.

472
00:56:38,177 --> 00:56:39,961
Oh, I'm sorry.

473
00:56:40,005 --> 00:56:42,486
Your mom will be back

474
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:44,488
in a little while, she had
a meeting at the hospital.

475
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:47,316
Sure.

476
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:49,623
Hey, Paul.

477
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:52,060
Hey, Steph.

478
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,325
I don't wanna remember.

479
00:56:56,369 --> 00:56:58,589
I don't want to remember.

480
00:56:58,632 --> 00:57:00,286
It's okay.

481
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:01,896
You're all right.

482
00:57:04,682 --> 00:57:05,813
I'm sorry.

483
00:57:05,857 --> 00:57:07,293
You don't have to apologize.

484
00:57:07,336 --> 00:57:09,251
But what are you sorry for?

485
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,733
I won't run away again.

486
00:57:12,777 --> 00:57:14,474
You're sick.

487
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:16,433
You have something inside you.

488
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:18,652
It's making you see things.

489
00:57:18,696 --> 00:57:21,612
It's making you do things.

490
00:57:21,655 --> 00:57:25,180
Part of what it's making you do
is hurting your memory.

491
00:57:25,224 --> 00:57:26,878
We think if you can remember,

492
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:28,749
it'll help you fight it.

493
00:57:28,793 --> 00:57:30,838
Your mother and I
have been talking

494
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:33,841
and there's something

495
00:57:33,885 --> 00:57:35,016
we'd like to try with you.

496
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,148
Like an experiment.

497
00:57:36,191 --> 00:57:37,932
More like a game.

498
00:57:37,976 --> 00:57:40,979
Mm-hmm.

499
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:44,504
I need you
to close your eyes.

500
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:46,288
Go on.

501
00:57:46,332 --> 00:57:49,248
I want you to listen
to these clicks.

502
00:57:53,818 --> 00:57:56,995
Let your body relax.

503
00:57:57,038 --> 00:58:00,259
Good. Let your mind wander.

504
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:03,131
That's it.

505
00:58:03,175 --> 00:58:06,526
Let it go.

506
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:09,268
Tell me what happened
the day Paul died.

507
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:11,009
Tell me what happened
that morning.

508
00:58:12,967 --> 00:58:14,534
We're carving pumpkins.

509
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:15,753
That's right.

510
00:58:15,796 --> 00:58:18,320
That's, that's good, princess.

511
00:58:18,364 --> 00:58:20,105
He's being mean.

512
00:58:20,148 --> 00:58:21,410
Teasing me.

513
00:58:21,454 --> 00:58:24,326
I think he was just playing
with you.

514
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,067
What happened next?

515
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:29,723
Cut it out!

516
00:58:29,767 --> 00:58:31,725
- I got mad.
- Sure, you did.

517
00:58:31,769 --> 00:58:33,161
Of course, you did.

518
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:34,859
And that's okay.

519
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:36,861
What happened after you got mad?

520
00:58:36,904 --> 00:58:38,297
I went for him.

521
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:43,563
How?

522
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:45,130
With my arms.

523
00:58:45,173 --> 00:58:48,350
All of them.

524
00:58:51,963 --> 00:58:53,442
What happened after that?

525
00:58:53,486 --> 00:58:55,619
I hit Mommy.

526
00:58:55,662 --> 00:58:57,055
Okay, stop. Stop.

527
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:59,013
- Just stop.
- You ran!

528
00:59:01,973 --> 00:59:04,845
You left me.

529
00:59:04,889 --> 00:59:07,195
Okay, Eric, stop it, now!

530
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:11,156
What happened next?

531
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:12,766
Stephanie!

532
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,028
Stephanie!

533
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Yes. I'm Stephanie.
I am Stephanie.

534
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,539
You happy?

535
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,410
You think she can control that?

536
00:59:48,454 --> 00:59:51,196
- We do it your way.
- Thank you.

537
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:14,959
That's still
our little girl in there.

538
01:00:19,877 --> 01:00:21,313
Stephanie?

539
01:00:24,229 --> 01:00:26,057
Princess?

540
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:33,499
What's next?

541
01:00:35,283 --> 01:00:36,981
If you take the razor,

542
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,811
and just...

543
01:00:40,854 --> 01:00:42,987
just shave
this section right here.

544
01:00:58,437 --> 01:01:00,308
Yeah.

545
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:07,838
You okay?

546
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:09,448
Yeah.

547
01:01:18,022 --> 01:01:19,937
Jesus Christ.

548
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,416
Actually,
it's relatively simple.

549
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,418
As soon as we get
through the bone,

550
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:24,724
we feed the endoscope through.

551
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:26,639
There's a natural pathway
for it to follow.

552
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,597
If this doesn't work?

553
01:01:29,947 --> 01:01:31,644
It's going to work.

554
01:02:12,511 --> 01:02:15,775
Tragedy unfolding in Mumbai.

555
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:17,995
We are now expecting
confirmation

556
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:19,518
from the White House.

557
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:22,347
There has been
an incident in the lab,

558
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:24,305
where the rumored
surgical trials

559
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:25,916
are being conducted.

560
01:02:25,959 --> 01:02:27,787
The death toll is unconfirmed,

561
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:30,529
but there were at least
200 physicians

562
01:02:30,572 --> 01:02:32,139
and researchers gathered

563
01:02:32,183 --> 01:02:33,793
by the coalition of nations,

564
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:35,926
at the facility.

565
01:02:35,969 --> 01:02:40,017
With all the therapeutic
containment efforts failing,

566
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:42,715
this surgery was viewed,
by many researchers,

567
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:46,371
as our last best hope
to finding a cure,

568
01:02:46,414 --> 01:02:48,765
a hope that is now fading.

569
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:50,244
The nation and the world

570
01:02:50,288 --> 01:02:52,856
are reckoning
with what some fringe elements

571
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:54,379
of the scientific community

572
01:02:54,422 --> 01:02:56,816
have been saying
since the initial outbreak

573
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,035
in April,

574
01:02:58,078 --> 01:03:00,385
that euthanasia may be

575
01:03:00,428 --> 01:03:02,779
the only cure.

576
01:04:02,577 --> 01:04:04,014
"Once upon a time,

577
01:04:04,057 --> 01:04:07,321
in a place
just beyond our sight,

578
01:04:07,365 --> 01:04:11,021
there lived a magical kingdom
called Anywhere.

579
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:13,675
In Anywhere,
anything was possible."

580
01:05:55,864 --> 01:05:58,128
Hey, Steph.

581
01:05:58,171 --> 01:06:00,957
Do you wanna come for a walk
in the orchard with me?

582
01:06:03,481 --> 01:06:04,786
Come on.

583
01:06:06,353 --> 01:06:08,225
Okay.

584
01:06:29,681 --> 01:06:32,075
I made you
some hot chocolate.

585
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:45,566
We haven't been out
to the orchard in a while.

586
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:47,177
Mm-hmm.

587
01:06:49,744 --> 01:06:52,051
Do you think we can make
some orange juice?

588
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:53,748
For all three of us?

589
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:55,185
I don't see why not.

590
01:06:55,228 --> 01:06:57,013
Okay.

591
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:27,826
I did that.

592
01:07:27,869 --> 01:07:30,742
- No, baby.
- Yes, I did.

593
01:07:30,785 --> 01:07:33,223
But you don't remember doing it.

594
01:07:33,266 --> 01:07:35,660
Well, then it wasn't you.

595
01:07:35,703 --> 01:07:38,793
What's wrong with me?

596
01:07:38,837 --> 01:07:41,100
Imagine you're a door,

597
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:42,232
and there's something

598
01:07:42,275 --> 01:07:43,885
that's trying
to come through.

599
01:07:43,929 --> 01:07:45,148
What is it?

600
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:47,889
We don't know.

601
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:50,109
Something we don't understand.

602
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:51,719
Something,

603
01:07:51,763 --> 01:07:54,157
from another place.

604
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,595
I don't even think
it has a body.

605
01:07:57,638 --> 01:07:58,857
That's why it uses yours.

606
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,337
It changes you.

607
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:02,382
And you're not alone,
there's kids like you

608
01:08:02,426 --> 01:08:03,949
all over the world.

609
01:08:03,992 --> 01:08:06,082
Can they stop it?

610
01:08:08,127 --> 01:08:10,738
There's one more thing
we're gonna try.

611
01:08:10,782 --> 01:08:11,913
I'm sorry.

612
01:08:11,957 --> 01:08:13,219
No, stop apologizing...

613
01:08:13,263 --> 01:08:15,439
- But I'm sorry.
- Don't be!

614
01:08:15,482 --> 01:08:18,529
Don't be sorry.

615
01:08:18,572 --> 01:08:19,921
You didn't do anything wrong.

616
01:08:19,965 --> 01:08:22,707
Not one day in your life.

617
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,926
Do you understand me?

618
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:32,978
I think it's getting cold.

619
01:08:33,021 --> 01:08:34,719
It's getting cold.

620
01:08:34,762 --> 01:08:36,199
We should drink up.

621
01:08:38,201 --> 01:08:39,332
Wait.

622
01:08:41,769 --> 01:08:44,163
Don't forget cheers, Dad.

623
01:08:45,643 --> 01:08:47,688
Cheers.

624
01:09:11,538 --> 01:09:14,802
Dad, wait. I, I can stop it.

625
01:09:14,846 --> 01:09:17,979
Dad. No, don't.

626
01:09:23,507 --> 01:09:26,553
See? I can stay calm.

627
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:44,180
I love you, Daddy.

628
01:09:44,223 --> 01:09:47,487
You are my baby girl.

629
01:09:47,531 --> 01:09:49,010
You're my princess.

630
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:53,711
I love you so much.

631
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,336
Stephanie...

632
01:10:12,382 --> 01:10:15,559
Steph

633
01:10:18,518 --> 01:10:21,608
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

634
01:11:19,536 --> 01:11:22,234
Ah.

635
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,890
Oh, what did I do?

636
01:11:29,633 --> 01:11:32,984
Oh, it's over,
I loved her. Oh.

637
01:12:23,817 --> 01:12:26,559
My God.

638
01:12:26,603 --> 01:12:27,691
- Upstairs.
- No, no!

639
01:12:27,734 --> 01:12:29,475
- Go! Go upstairs.
- No, no!

640
01:12:29,519 --> 01:12:31,042
- Go!
- No!

641
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

642
01:12:47,624 --> 01:12:50,409
Princess... oh.

643
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

644
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:19,933
Stop! St... Stop!

645
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,417
You tried to kill me.

646
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:28,812
You're not my daughter.

647
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:34,992
What the hell are you?

648
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:37,995
Big.

649
01:14:46,743 --> 01:14:49,049
Stay there. Clear?

650
01:14:50,442 --> 01:14:51,835
Good.

651
01:14:55,882 --> 01:14:59,059
No! I'm so... I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

652
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:24,998
We should have never left you.

653
01:15:26,043 --> 01:15:27,871
You shouldn't have come back.
