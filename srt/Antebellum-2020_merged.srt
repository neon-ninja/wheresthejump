2
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:57,507
Em? Darlin'?

3
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,748
Get.

4
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,969
Kill me. Kill me.

5
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:40,785
Now, don't you worry, girl.

6
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:45,256
I will accommodate you.

7
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,843
No!

8
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:49,847
I often ponder
the depths of your loyalty.

9
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:52,883
Prove me wrong.

10
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,888
Say your name, girl.

11
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:03,160
Say your name.

12
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,083
It brings me no joy
to do this.

13
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,158
Silence!

14
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:36,894
You will speak only when
I instruct you to speak.

15
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:41,966
I am responsible
for you now,

16
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,335
and I will tame
your savage ways.

17
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,106
- Now, get up.
- No, no!

18
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,308
Come on.

19
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,412
Say your name, girl.

20
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,885
Comply!

21
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,156
You've given me no choice.

22
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,036
Now, please stand up for me.

23
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:21,939
No, no, no!

24
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:25,209
No, no, no, no, no!

25
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:29,546
Your friends are dead
because of you.

26
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,814
You know that, right?

27
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,585
Try to escape again,

28
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:36,920
I'll drag you
to the burn shed myself.

29
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:59,343
Now, let's try this again.

30
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:04,381
Say your name, girl.

31
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,918
Eden.

32
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,187
Eden.

33
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,057
Say your name
with pride and conviction!

34
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:18,529
Eden.
My name is Eden.

35
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,902
That's good, Eden.
Real good.

36
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:29,606
Everything will be
all right now, and, uh,

37
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,511
you can stop
that cryin'.

38
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,231
Maybe I can get away
for supper tomorrow.

39
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:56,166
You can make us a chicken.

40
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:29,460
Y'all seem easily distracted.

41
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,398
Why don't we break up
this monotony

42
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:35,767
and get y'all focused?

43
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:39,369
Go on, sing us somethin'.

44
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:44,041
Perhaps one of those
old Negro tunes.

45
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,757
We need to move.
These fuckers is crazy.

46
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:11,703
Next time,
I won't be so generous.

47
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:17,341
Back to work. All of you!

48
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,678
Let the sound
of Confederate victory

49
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:22,513
bring joy to your labor.

50
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:07,190
Milk, chicken.

51
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:09,192
We must try again.

52
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:17,100
- Get down. Get down!
- Get off there. Come on.

53
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:21,104
- Get off the wagon.
- Move! Get out of here!

54
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:24,174
What you lookin' at?
Line up. Come on!

55
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:25,242
Hurry!

56
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,746
Line up!
Get over there.

57
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,551
Eden! Get your ass
down here, girl!

58
00:15:38,923 --> 00:15:41,525
Separate yourself.
Turn.

59
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:49,867
Look at her hair.

60
00:15:51,703 --> 00:15:53,236
Quite a beauty.

61
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,139
Shall we
name her, child?

62
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:58,241
Mmm... Let's name
her Julia.

63
00:15:58,275 --> 00:15:59,376
Hmm.

64
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:01,645
You hear that?

65
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:07,417
Those are worker hands.

66
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:09,887
You're dismissed.

67
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:17,862
Well,

68
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:21,632
welcome home, one and all.

69
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,236
Now, listen up! All of you.

70
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:33,610
This here
is a reformer plantation

71
00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:35,880
commandeered
by the Ninth Infantry

72
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,649
of the Confederate Army
of the 13 states.

73
00:16:41,485 --> 00:16:43,487
Wherever you were before,

74
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:49,559
whatever small freedoms
you might have enjoyed,

75
00:16:50,895 --> 00:16:53,196
I'm here to tell you
that's over.

76
00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:58,803
I don't tolerate any back talk
whatsoever from inferiors.

77
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:04,976
In fact,
on this plantation,

78
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:08,680
you will only speak when
given permission to do so.

79
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,449
That means

80
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:18,288
absolutely no talking
among yourselves

81
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:21,224
unless one of the white folk
on property...

82
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,762
...gives you permission
to do so.

83
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:29,466
If you do...

84
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,468
Oh.

85
00:17:32,502 --> 00:17:33,738
We will know about it.

86
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,443
Over here,
you will find your cabins.

87
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,012
You will also
be given instructions

88
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:42,579
by one of the overseers

89
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:44,648
as to your daily duties,

90
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:46,784
which ought to be
followed obediently

91
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:51,421
and with a smile.

92
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:56,861
Here, we whistle
while we work.

93
00:17:56,894 --> 00:17:58,696
Ain't that right, Eli?

94
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:02,566
Raise the flag,
Corporal.

95
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,001
The general will be
home this evening.

96
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:06,838
You're dismissed.

97
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:07,872
Get.

98
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:10,742
Go on. Walk, now.

99
00:18:11,575 --> 00:18:14,444
Get on. Let's go, move.

100
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:16,480
Hey, what is this?

101
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,849
Quiet!

102
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:19,549
Go, now!

103
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,019
Mmm. You started early.

104
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:27,919
When?

105
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:04,487
How many...

106
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:08,391
Get in here.

107
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:15,967
You're from
Virginia, right?

108
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:22,907
I'm from North Carolina.

109
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:30,513
Look, I can't do this.

110
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:33,117
Whatever you're doin',

111
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,551
I can't do it.

112
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:37,121
Listen to me.

113
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,824
Wherever you came from
before here,

114
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:42,626
- you need to forget about it.
- Mmm-mmm.

115
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,829
That is not possible for me.

116
00:20:47,765 --> 00:20:49,432
What are we doin'?

117
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:55,773
Huh? What is the plan?

118
00:20:55,806 --> 00:20:57,540
You think I haven't tried?

119
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:14,191
We must choose
our moment wisely.

120
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,496
But until then,

121
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:24,567
we keep our heads down
and our mouths shut.

122
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:27,570
Do you understand me?

123
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:33,510
I know you.

124
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:41,018
And I know that you are
my only way out of here.

125
00:21:50,828 --> 00:21:52,462
I'm pregnant.

126
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:07,912
I need you to listen to me.

127
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:11,882
You have to keep quiet.

128
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,851
These white people
will kill you.

129
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:16,087
Oh, you think being quiet
is being strong, huh?

130
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:21,591
What has that
ever gotten us?

131
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:32,036
You ain't no leader.

132
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:36,173
You're just a talker.

133
00:22:36,207 --> 00:22:38,541
Ain't that right, huh?

134
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:41,912
You... Hey!

135
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,715
What, you just
a coward nigger slave

136
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:46,083
with a brand
and no backbone?

137
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:55,259
Blood and soil.

138
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:58,796
Blood and soil.
Blood and soil.

139
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:46,010
As you were.

140
00:23:48,312 --> 00:23:49,947
First,

141
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:52,149
I want to congratulate you

142
00:23:52,183 --> 00:23:55,119
on our defeat of the Yanks
at Milliken's.

143
00:23:57,121 --> 00:24:00,724
This is what
victory looks like!

144
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:10,968
We got those blue-bellied
bastards on their heels,

145
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:13,270
Washington in our sights.

146
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,175
But we must never relent.

147
00:24:22,947 --> 00:24:24,949
We are descendants
of the gods

148
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:27,351
and we will fight

149
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:30,688
with the same immeasurable
courage and vigor.

150
00:24:32,857 --> 00:24:35,392
We will sacrifice our blood

151
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:39,196
and fertilize this soil
of our homeland.

152
00:24:40,865 --> 00:24:43,901
This is the only hope we have

153
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:48,172
of retaining our heritage,
our way of life.

154
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:54,912
This land
was always ours.

155
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:59,250
It is our
rightful inheritance.

156
00:25:01,218 --> 00:25:04,688
And, rest assured,
our nationalist state

157
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:10,394
will not be stolen from us
by these traitors to America.

158
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,333
I have faith in this
because I have faith in you.

159
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:20,171
You all are the future.

160
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:22,439
And it is you

161
00:25:23,874 --> 00:25:28,112
who will lead us all
to the ultimate victory.

162
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:35,286
But for tonight,
let us put away our troubles.

163
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:39,156
Drink and be merry.
You've earned it. All of you.

164
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,392
And, by the way,

165
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:48,165
these Sapphires are here
to fulfill your every need,

166
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,804
whatever those needs
may be.

167
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,474
Faith! Family! Folk!

168
00:25:57,508 --> 00:25:59,076
Faith! Family! Folk!

169
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:06,483
As you were.

170
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,792
So, which one
of these girls do you like?

171
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:15,859
What?

172
00:26:15,893 --> 00:26:16,994
Which one of these girls
do you like?

173
00:26:25,135 --> 00:26:26,136
Hey, angel.

174
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:28,906
Yeah, you.

175
00:26:30,207 --> 00:26:32,109
Come here. I don't bite.

176
00:26:33,477 --> 00:26:34,945
Come on.

177
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,188
My compadre here
was just telling me

178
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:46,223
he thinks
you're real pretty.

179
00:26:46,257 --> 00:26:48,792
No, man. No.

180
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:51,328
What, you don't think
she's pretty? Hmm?

181
00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:52,796
No, I mean...

182
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:56,834
Yeah, of course I do.

183
00:26:56,867 --> 00:27:00,504
Well, then.
She ain't gonna say no. Hmm?

184
00:27:02,273 --> 00:27:03,474
Talk to her.

185
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:07,177
You're in charge here.

186
00:27:15,185 --> 00:27:16,186
Um...

187
00:27:17,454 --> 00:27:19,556
Uh... I, um...

188
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:21,825
Well, I...

189
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:23,994
Oh, just...
Fuck's sake.

190
00:27:24,028 --> 00:27:25,462
He will meet you
at your cabin

191
00:27:25,496 --> 00:27:27,398
immediately following
dinner service.

192
00:27:28,198 --> 00:27:30,267
You're dismissed
as of this moment.

193
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:33,337
Now, go and prepare
for your corporal.

194
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:39,176
What's that, girl?

195
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:42,079
Yes,

196
00:27:43,947 --> 00:27:45,015
sir.

197
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:47,084
That's more like it.

198
00:27:52,122 --> 00:27:53,424
Go on, now. Go.

199
00:28:01,332 --> 00:28:03,267
Well, you enjoy,
all right?

200
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,837
I'm going around back
to the whipping post.

201
00:28:26,924 --> 00:28:28,492
If I may?

202
00:28:30,494 --> 00:28:31,962
I never got
your name.

203
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:34,264
Daniel. Um...

204
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:38,135
It's Daniel.

205
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:40,839
Well, thank you, Daniel.

206
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:44,875
For earlier.

207
00:28:46,343 --> 00:28:49,279
You said that I was pretty.

208
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:55,586
Of course you are.
Anyone can see that.

209
00:29:00,424 --> 00:29:01,425
It's, um...

210
00:29:02,426 --> 00:29:04,061
It's just been
such a long time

211
00:29:04,094 --> 00:29:07,231
since any man
has been nice to me.

212
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:10,467
I appreciate
the compliment is all.

213
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:20,077
How'd you get
to be so sweet?

214
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:28,152
Look, you don't...

215
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:32,389
You don't have to do this.

216
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:35,159
I can tell
that you're special.

217
00:29:37,461 --> 00:29:40,597
You're not like the others.
Those monsters.

218
00:29:50,574 --> 00:29:52,943
Why'd you speak to me?

219
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,615
You mean, when your friend
called me over before?

220
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:01,118
No. Why'd you
speak to me

221
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:03,020
when I entered the room
just now?

222
00:30:06,089 --> 00:30:07,291
Uh...

223
00:30:09,092 --> 00:30:14,131
I just thought we should have
a proper introduction.

224
00:30:14,164 --> 00:30:16,066
You have
a short memory, then.

225
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:18,736
You heard
Commander Jasper.

226
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,105
You speak only when
given permission to do so.

227
00:30:22,139 --> 00:30:24,742
- Is that not right?
- Yes, sir. Uh...

228
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:26,711
I mean, Daniel.

229
00:30:26,744 --> 00:30:28,579
No. It's "sir"!

230
00:30:32,817 --> 00:30:36,119
You don't know shit!
You don't know shit!

231
00:30:36,153 --> 00:30:37,154
Okay.

232
00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:42,059
I'm as much a Confederate
as any man here.

233
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,126
Because I don't wanna sleep

234
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,229
with no filthy fucking mongrel

235
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:49,233
instead of my own kind,
that don't make me no...

236
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,635
I'm... I'm a patriot!
You understand me?

237
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,772
Shut the fuck up!

238
00:30:54,806 --> 00:30:56,340
Shut up!

239
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:00,611
You're lucky
I don't tell Jasper.

240
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:02,279
You better make him believe
I had my way with you

241
00:31:02,312 --> 00:31:03,380
if you know what's good
for you.

242
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:04,448
You understand me?

243
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:06,450
Get off of me.

244
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:09,286
Uh...

245
00:31:40,183 --> 00:31:44,521
Well, you're forgiven
your tardiness, this time.

246
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:46,724
Don't make it a habit,
or the stocks will be waitin'.

247
00:32:02,707 --> 00:32:04,474
Are you okay?

248
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:08,478
Please...

249
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:13,617
I know. Be patient.

250
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:16,688
Just keep goin'.
We have to keep goin'.

251
00:32:20,157 --> 00:32:22,125
Oh, no!

252
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,128
No! No, no, no!

253
00:32:33,938 --> 00:32:36,708
No!

254
00:32:36,741 --> 00:32:39,376
- Oh, no! No!
- It's okay.

255
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:41,111
It's not okay!

256
00:32:51,455 --> 00:32:52,456
Cracker!

257
00:32:55,927 --> 00:32:57,795
The fuck
you just say, boy?

258
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,703
Oh, I'm gonna be
right back for you.

259
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:07,170
Hyah.

260
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:09,841
What the fuck is the issue?

261
00:33:09,874 --> 00:33:11,676
She's sick, sir.

262
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:13,477
Oh, no...

263
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,513
Oh... Go on.
Go get yourself cleaned up.

264
00:33:16,546 --> 00:33:17,749
May I go with her?

265
00:33:17,782 --> 00:33:20,350
She can handle herself.
Get back to work.

266
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,886
Sir...

267
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:25,222
Oh.

268
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:28,392
Fine. Go clean her up,
get back here.

269
00:33:42,707 --> 00:33:44,307
Take hold of him.

270
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,477
It's okay, boy.

271
00:33:54,551 --> 00:33:55,552
Now,

272
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,624
what was that
you were sayin',

273
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:04,762
boy?

274
00:34:11,703 --> 00:34:12,737
Oh.

275
00:34:14,404 --> 00:34:15,773
You missing your woman?

276
00:34:20,444 --> 00:34:21,813
Give me an excuse.

277
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,581
Go on.

278
00:34:28,753 --> 00:34:29,754
No.

279
00:34:32,556 --> 00:34:35,993
Why, that reminds me,
the shed needs cleanin'.

280
00:34:37,627 --> 00:34:40,932
Too many foolish Negroes
with rebellious hearts.

281
00:34:44,702 --> 00:34:48,371
Yeah. Go get that
cleaned up, boy.

282
00:34:48,405 --> 00:34:50,474
That should stop you
flappin' them gums.

283
00:34:55,947 --> 00:34:56,981
Yes,

284
00:34:58,916 --> 00:34:59,951
sir.

285
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:02,653
Yes, sir.

286
00:35:05,422 --> 00:35:06,623
Go on, get.

287
00:35:14,464 --> 00:35:16,533
Cracker-ass cracker.

288
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:56,827
Sweet dreams, Eden.

289
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,801
Good morning, Steph.

290
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:37,902
<i>Good morning, V.</i>

291
00:38:37,935 --> 00:38:39,737
<i>Just making sure
you're ready for your flight.</i>

292
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:40,972
<i>Skype is at 8:45,</i>

293
00:38:41,005 --> 00:38:42,707
<i>and the car will be there
at 9:00.</i>

294
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,642
- Oh, shit. Okay. All right.
- <i>Okay.</i>

295
00:38:45,676 --> 00:38:47,510
- Thanks, Steph. Bye.
- <i>Safe travels.</i>

296
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:54,151
Another bad dream?

297
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:58,189
No. I'm... I'm okay.

298
00:38:59,924 --> 00:39:04,128
Babe? Can you
please do me a favor?

299
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:05,997
Anything.

300
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,699
Can you get Ken Ken
dressed for me today?

301
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:10,935
Of course. Mmm-hmm.

302
00:39:10,968 --> 00:39:13,671
My first meeting is
right here in Georgetown

303
00:39:13,704 --> 00:39:16,273
and it got pushed
to 11:00 anyway, so...

304
00:39:16,307 --> 00:39:17,574
Okay.

305
00:39:18,075 --> 00:39:20,044
I don't know.

306
00:39:20,077 --> 00:39:24,315
I'm not gonna even be
dressed before 9:00.

307
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:27,184
- I got you. I got you.
- Thank you, babe.

308
00:39:28,953 --> 00:39:32,990
But would it be the
worst thing in the world

309
00:39:33,024 --> 00:39:34,557
if you didn't make it?

310
00:39:39,997 --> 00:39:41,799
Not today.
Not today.

311
00:39:41,832 --> 00:39:44,735
There she is.

312
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:46,771
My favorite girl.

313
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:49,240
- Guess what?
- What?

314
00:39:49,273 --> 00:39:52,243
Daddy is gonna get
you dressed for school today.

315
00:39:52,276 --> 00:39:56,313
I know exactly
what I want to wear.

316
00:39:56,347 --> 00:39:57,748
You do?

317
00:39:57,782 --> 00:39:59,050
- Hurry up.
- I'm comin', girl.

318
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:00,084
- She said "Hurry," Daddy.
- I'm hurryin'...

319
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:01,786
I'm hurryin'.

320
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:03,120
- Hurry up.
- You're gonna pull

321
00:40:03,154 --> 00:40:04,155
my arm off.

322
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:06,824
Okay, okay, okay.

323
00:40:06,857 --> 00:40:08,159
What you wearin' today?

324
00:40:32,316 --> 00:40:34,685
Well,
look at you two.

325
00:40:34,718 --> 00:40:35,920
Look at you.

326
00:40:35,953 --> 00:40:38,122
Mommy loves that dress.

327
00:40:38,155 --> 00:40:40,825
Excellent
choice, baby.

328
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:42,326
Yeah, she picked it.

329
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,296
- Hi, babe.
- You stay trendin'.

330
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:48,299
Paused it for you.

331
00:40:48,332 --> 00:40:51,769
<i>I understand
you think you are defending</i>

332
00:40:51,802 --> 00:40:53,636
<i>the plight of the black man.</i>

333
00:40:53,671 --> 00:40:56,140
<i>I guess, in your case,
the black woman.</i>

334
00:40:56,173 --> 00:40:58,943
<i>But we are doing a disservice
to the argument,</i>

335
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:00,678
<i>much less your people...</i>

336
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:04,782
<i>by conflating race
with basic common sense.</i>

337
00:41:04,815 --> 00:41:06,884
<i>I would say this.</i>

338
00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:09,753
<i>The disenfranchisement
of black people in America</i>

339
00:41:09,787 --> 00:41:10,821
<i>is by design,</i>

340
00:41:10,855 --> 00:41:13,657
<i>written into the actual DNA
of this country.</i>

341
00:41:13,691 --> 00:41:15,893
<i>Your argument,
however flawed</i>

342
00:41:15,926 --> 00:41:17,695
<i>has been successfully promoted</i>

343
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:19,230
<i>and propagated
through repetition.</i>

344
00:41:19,263 --> 00:41:22,099
<i>We hear it over
and over again.</i>

345
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:23,334
<i>But I'm here to tell you</i>

346
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:25,836
<i>that this vicious cycle
of inequity</i>

347
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,371
<i>will soon be broken.</i>

348
00:41:28,706 --> 00:41:30,207
- Boom!
- Boom!

349
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:31,275
- Boom!
- Boom!

350
00:41:31,308 --> 00:41:32,977
Boom!

351
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,247
Mommy, why was
that man so angry?

352
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,184
Oh, baby,
that is a really great question.

353
00:41:45,055 --> 00:41:48,893
Sometimes
what looks like anger

354
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:52,062
is really just fear.

355
00:41:52,096 --> 00:41:55,199
Things are not always
what they appear to be, baby.

356
00:41:55,232 --> 00:41:56,333
Does that make sense?

357
00:41:58,802 --> 00:42:02,406
Do you remember when Vanessa
was bullying you at school?

358
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:03,941
She was pickin' on you?

359
00:42:03,974 --> 00:42:05,075
And Mommy had to
come up there

360
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:06,310
because Vanessa thought

361
00:42:06,343 --> 00:42:08,245
that you were gonna
come in class

362
00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:10,814
and take
all of her toys away.

363
00:42:10,848 --> 00:42:12,983
And now you two
are like best friends.

364
00:42:14,818 --> 00:42:17,221
So, are you two
friends yet?

365
00:42:22,826 --> 00:42:23,827
Not yet, baby.

366
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:26,697
Mommy's working on it.

367
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:58,395
Pancake?

368
00:42:58,429 --> 00:43:00,764
Pancake?
On a Tuesday?

369
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:03,534
What is the special occasion?

370
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:05,169
Well, I was informed

371
00:43:05,202 --> 00:43:07,438
it was pancakes or nothing,
so, you know,

372
00:43:07,471 --> 00:43:08,973
we gotta pick our battles.

373
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:11,108
Um, question,
are we vegan this week?

374
00:43:12,209 --> 00:43:16,547
Babe, the struggle
is real.

375
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:21,252
Got it. So, one non-vegan
pancake coming up.

376
00:43:21,285 --> 00:43:24,255
Babe, no. I cannot.

377
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:35,899
Elizabeth?

378
00:43:35,933 --> 00:43:39,270
<i>Yes. Dr. Henley.</i>

379
00:43:39,303 --> 00:43:43,307
Hi. And please call me Veronica.

380
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,875
How are you this morning?

381
00:43:44,908 --> 00:43:46,443
<i>Oh, I'm fine.</i>

382
00:43:46,477 --> 00:43:49,880
<i>That lipstick just looks
lovely on you.</i>

383
00:43:51,015 --> 00:43:53,484
<i>It suits your skin tone.</i>

384
00:43:53,517 --> 00:43:56,420
<i>I don't think I could
pull it off.</i>

385
00:43:58,155 --> 00:44:00,824
So, do you have
any questions for me?

386
00:44:00,858 --> 00:44:02,393
How did you
come across my work?

387
00:44:02,426 --> 00:44:06,297
<i>Oh, I saw you on one of
those legacy media networks.</i>

388
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:10,434
<i>I believe it was a roundtable
discussion about inclusion.</i>

389
00:44:12,002 --> 00:44:13,570
<i>You were so articulate.</i>

390
00:44:13,604 --> 00:44:17,107
<i>It must have been
a ratings bonanza.</i>

391
00:44:17,141 --> 00:44:21,245
Those particular segments
do garner a lot of attention.

392
00:44:21,278 --> 00:44:22,212
I don't mean to be curt,

393
00:44:22,246 --> 00:44:25,015
but do you have any questions
around the book?

394
00:44:25,649 --> 00:44:29,086
<i>Oh. Your book.</i>

395
00:44:30,454 --> 00:44:31,989
<i>Yes, I believe
you mentioned it</i>

396
00:44:32,022 --> 00:44:34,591
<i>on that show that you were on.</i>

397
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:38,062
<i>As a matter of fact,
I know you mentioned it.</i>

398
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:39,530
<i>'Cause I thought
it was rather odd</i>

399
00:44:39,563 --> 00:44:44,501
<i>that you chose that moment
to be peddlin' your wares.</i>

400
00:44:44,535 --> 00:44:47,438
Well, actually,
that particular segment

401
00:44:47,471 --> 00:44:50,541
focused on the lack
of inclusion.

402
00:44:50,574 --> 00:44:53,544
And that is exactly
what my book highlights.

403
00:44:53,577 --> 00:44:57,981
Intersectionality of race,
class, and gender.

404
00:44:58,015 --> 00:45:00,250
I wrote
<i>Shedding the Coping Persona</i>

405
00:45:00,284 --> 00:45:04,054
as a road map to revolution

406
00:45:04,088 --> 00:45:06,557
for historically
marginalized people.

407
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:08,660
Maybe I didn't catch
this earlier,

408
00:45:08,693 --> 00:45:10,427
but who did you say
you were with again?

409
00:45:10,461 --> 00:45:12,463
<i>I didn't mention it.</i>

410
00:45:12,496 --> 00:45:14,666
<i>I'm a bit of a talent scout.</i>

411
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:18,469
Oh. So, you're a headhunter.
That makes sense.

412
00:45:18,502 --> 00:45:20,571
<i>I'm a headhunter.</i>

413
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:26,210
<i>Exactly that.</i>

414
00:45:26,243 --> 00:45:27,478
<i>Oh.</i>

415
00:45:28,345 --> 00:45:30,447
<i>Now, is that Kennedi?</i>

416
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:34,418
<i>Will you move the camera over?
Oh. She's so cute.</i>

417
00:45:34,451 --> 00:45:35,687
<i>She'll make
a perfect little companion</i>

418
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,954
<i>for my daughter.</i>

419
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:39,623
<i>I see a playdate
in our future.</i>

420
00:45:39,657 --> 00:45:41,492
As my assistant
mentioned earlier,

421
00:45:41,525 --> 00:45:43,927
I am short on time
this morning.

422
00:45:43,961 --> 00:45:45,697
<i>Oh, no problem. I didn't
mean to trigger you none.</i>

423
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,165
<i>You have fun at your summit,
and I'll see you soon.</i>

424
00:45:48,198 --> 00:45:50,300
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

425
00:45:54,204 --> 00:45:57,107
- Who was that?
- Oh, baby.

426
00:45:57,141 --> 00:45:58,942
It's nobody.

427
00:45:58,976 --> 00:46:01,512
Don't worry
about that woman, okay?

428
00:46:01,545 --> 00:46:03,113
Okay.

429
00:46:03,147 --> 00:46:05,082
That's my car.

430
00:46:05,115 --> 00:46:07,084
I can't even imagine what
y'all are about to get into.

431
00:46:07,117 --> 00:46:09,520
- Obviously.
- Mommy, wait.

432
00:46:09,553 --> 00:46:11,121
- I'll call you. I love you.
- I almost forgot.

433
00:46:11,155 --> 00:46:12,657
This is for you.

434
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:15,092
Oh, baby.

435
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:17,528
This is for Mommy?

436
00:46:17,561 --> 00:46:21,999
Ken Ken, I'm putting this
with all my important work.

437
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:27,137
When you look in the sky
and you see that big airplane,

438
00:46:27,171 --> 00:46:30,007
you'll know that's Mommy,
comin' home to you.

439
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,576
- Wow. That's a big head.
- Daddy. Come on.

440
00:46:32,609 --> 00:46:34,712
It's not that big.

441
00:46:34,746 --> 00:46:37,314
And I'm gonna hang it
on my wall in my hotel.

442
00:46:37,347 --> 00:46:38,582
Yeah.

443
00:46:39,684 --> 00:46:41,118
- Daddy.
- Yes?

444
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,386
Twenty minutes
of screen time.

445
00:46:42,419 --> 00:46:43,520
Okay.

446
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:45,489
- I need you to be strong.
- We got you.

447
00:46:45,522 --> 00:46:47,124
Be good.

448
00:46:47,157 --> 00:46:51,094
Mommy loves you. Come here.
Come here. Kiss me.

449
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,131
Give Mommy all the kisses.

450
00:46:54,164 --> 00:46:55,132
One minute.

451
00:46:55,165 --> 00:46:56,200
I'll be back, baby.
I'll be back.

452
00:46:56,233 --> 00:46:57,702
- Okay, okay. I love you, baby.
- Bye. Love you, babe.

453
00:46:57,735 --> 00:46:59,269
- All right.
- All right, be safe.

454
00:46:59,303 --> 00:47:00,571
I love you.
I'll be back, baby.

455
00:47:00,604 --> 00:47:02,639
Love you more, Mommy.

456
00:47:41,645 --> 00:47:44,047
Okay. Release.

457
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:49,821
And as we begin to gather
our thoughts for the day,

458
00:47:49,854 --> 00:47:54,191
I want you to focus on
bringing positivity and light

459
00:47:54,224 --> 00:47:57,594
to each and every situation
you may face today.

460
00:47:58,696 --> 00:48:00,264
Visualize yourself

461
00:48:00,297 --> 00:48:03,267
addressing any obstacles
you might face

462
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,402
with the same determination

463
00:48:05,435 --> 00:48:08,438
and focus that you brought
to your practice today.

464
00:48:09,573 --> 00:48:12,509
See yourself
emerging successful

465
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,712
and victorious
on the other side.

466
00:48:16,848 --> 00:48:18,415
<i>Namaste.</i>

467
00:48:18,917 --> 00:48:20,617
<i>Namaste.</i>

468
00:48:21,786 --> 00:48:23,688
V! V, girl,
I got some tea.

469
00:48:23,721 --> 00:48:26,724
You better open this door
and let me come and spill it.

470
00:48:26,758 --> 00:48:29,761
Positivity
and light, right?

471
00:48:29,794 --> 00:48:30,862
V!

472
00:48:30,895 --> 00:48:32,129
I'm coming!

473
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:34,866
No, no. Faster!

474
00:48:34,899 --> 00:48:37,134
I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

475
00:48:40,637 --> 00:48:43,440
- Hey. How are you?
- Hey, babes!

476
00:48:43,473 --> 00:48:44,742
- Good mornting.
- Good mornting.

477
00:48:44,776 --> 00:48:48,412
How is the number one
relationship specialist...

478
00:48:48,445 --> 00:48:49,513
- True.
- ...in the world

479
00:48:49,546 --> 00:48:50,614
doing this mornting, doll?

480
00:48:50,647 --> 00:48:53,718
Well, you know... Ooh,
it's hot. Just flourishing.

481
00:48:53,751 --> 00:48:56,620
You know, being amazing
and fantastic as per usual.

482
00:48:56,654 --> 00:48:58,622
- You're looking sharp. Yes.
- You know how I do. Thank you.

483
00:48:58,656 --> 00:49:02,292
Oh, hello. Why is it
so goddamn hot in here?

484
00:49:02,326 --> 00:49:05,562
I'm trying to create
my own version of Bikram.

485
00:49:05,596 --> 00:49:08,332
You know I need
all the balance I can get.

486
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:10,567
Well, speaking of
balance, I saw you balance

487
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:13,270
and tag that ass
last night on TV, girl.

488
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:16,506
You got him
all the way together.

489
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,376
- Bye.
- Bye. Thank you.

490
00:49:20,778 --> 00:49:22,747
Okay. Before we
get down to it,

491
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,215
how is my favorite little
human in the world,

492
00:49:25,248 --> 00:49:26,450
Miss Kennedi?

493
00:49:26,483 --> 00:49:29,553
She's great. She's doing good.
Yesterday was tough, though.

494
00:49:30,855 --> 00:49:33,523
- It was tough.
- I just... Ugh.

495
00:49:33,557 --> 00:49:36,293
It breaks my heart every time
I have to leave her.

496
00:49:36,326 --> 00:49:37,929
Mmm. Ken Ken.

497
00:49:37,962 --> 00:49:40,665
I just feel like
I'm not doing enough.

498
00:49:40,698 --> 00:49:43,400
It's like when I'm at home,
I'm not working enough.

499
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:45,535
When I'm working,
I'm not home enough.

500
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:47,604
I'm not Mom enough.
I'm not wife enough.

501
00:49:47,638 --> 00:49:48,706
Mmm-mmm,
mmm-mmm-mmm.

502
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,575
Okay, you listen
to me now. Okay?

503
00:49:51,608 --> 00:49:55,646
Yes, you're a superwoman,
but you're also a human woman.

504
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,849
Okay? And you
are doing awesome.

505
00:49:57,882 --> 00:49:58,816
And Miss Kennedi,

506
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:01,618
or as the world
will one day refer to her,

507
00:50:01,653 --> 00:50:02,619
Madam President,

508
00:50:02,654 --> 00:50:05,690
is living her best life
thanks to you, okay?

509
00:50:05,723 --> 00:50:08,458
So be nicer
to yourself, please.

510
00:50:08,492 --> 00:50:11,696
- Thank you. I love you.
- Mmm-hmm. I love you, too.

511
00:50:11,729 --> 00:50:12,830
Now...

512
00:50:13,731 --> 00:50:16,233
So, Camille's
hostididy ass, right?

513
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:17,601
- You, girl...
- Oh, girl.

514
00:50:17,634 --> 00:50:19,369
- ...Camille was in the...
- Babe, I can't. I can't.

515
00:50:19,403 --> 00:50:20,905
I... You know
I usually would,

516
00:50:20,938 --> 00:50:22,539
but I have to get
to this walk-through.

517
00:50:22,572 --> 00:50:23,741
I'm already
runnin' behind.

518
00:50:23,775 --> 00:50:25,308
No, I get it.
You're too good for it today.

519
00:50:26,678 --> 00:50:29,446
No, I get it. You tryin' to
<i>namaste</i> in a peaceful space.

520
00:50:29,479 --> 00:50:31,816
And I'm about to ruin that,
so let me just see myself out.

521
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:33,383
<i>♪ I love
you, I love you I love you ♪</i>

522
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:35,419
You're welcome
for this free coffee.

523
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:37,789
I paid $74.93 for that.

524
00:50:37,822 --> 00:50:40,390
- No, you did not.
- I will Cash App you.

525
00:50:40,424 --> 00:50:42,526
- Stop. All right.
- I will. I will. I will.

526
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,728
All right.

527
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:47,631
And I wanna remind you to
be good to yourself, okay?

528
00:50:47,665 --> 00:50:48,733
- Be kind to yourself.
- All right.

529
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:49,801
- Be kind to my friend.
- I will.

530
00:50:49,834 --> 00:50:50,735
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

531
00:50:50,768 --> 00:50:53,270
All right, I'll see you
downstairs. Bye.

532
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:02,780
Girl.

533
00:51:05,382 --> 00:51:06,383
Ms. Henley?

534
00:51:07,785 --> 00:51:09,821
- Yes?
- Delivery.

535
00:51:10,888 --> 00:51:12,790
Oh.

536
00:51:12,824 --> 00:51:14,959
The front desk
didn't even call.

537
00:51:15,793 --> 00:51:17,227
Who are these from?

538
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,337
V! Oh, my God.

539
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:01,304
Sarah Bee!

540
00:52:01,338 --> 00:52:02,974
I'm so sorry.
I did not mean to scare you.

541
00:52:03,007 --> 00:52:06,077
It's okay. I have just been
so jumpy this morning.

542
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:07,945
I guess it's travel
or something.

543
00:52:07,979 --> 00:52:09,747
Okay, I love you,
but I have to run to my panel

544
00:52:09,781 --> 00:52:11,983
"The Exorcism of
the Unconscious Past."

545
00:52:12,016 --> 00:52:13,583
Ah.

546
00:52:13,617 --> 00:52:15,686
"The past is never dead."

547
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,823
"It's not even past."

548
00:52:18,856 --> 00:52:20,624
You know,
my nana used to say,

549
00:52:20,658 --> 00:52:22,927
"Our ancestors
haunt our dreams

550
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,962
"to see themselves forward."

551
00:52:24,996 --> 00:52:26,596
The unresolved past

552
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,331
can certainly wreak havoc
on the present.

553
00:52:28,365 --> 00:52:31,368
Listen, have an amazing panel.
You're gonna be incredible.

554
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:33,037
- I'll see you later, girl.
- I'll see you tonight, babe.

555
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,371
Love you.

556
00:52:36,908 --> 00:52:38,375
Hi.

557
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:39,643
Can I please
make a reservation

558
00:52:39,677 --> 00:52:41,511
at Stefano's tonight?

559
00:52:41,545 --> 00:52:42,546
Concierge.

560
00:52:45,049 --> 00:52:47,952
Of course.
Working on it as we speak.

561
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:52,389
What can I do for you?

562
00:52:53,658 --> 00:52:56,393
May I make a reservation
for three at Stefano's?

563
00:52:56,426 --> 00:52:58,062
Um, let's say around 7:30.

564
00:52:58,095 --> 00:52:59,864
And I'm in
the Jefferson Suite.

565
00:52:59,897 --> 00:53:00,965
Sure.

566
00:53:04,735 --> 00:53:05,903
God bless.

567
00:53:20,918 --> 00:53:23,087
Oh, shoot.

568
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,959
Puddin', I left my key
in the room. Do you mind?

569
00:55:21,806 --> 00:55:24,275
<i>You know,
I learned very quickly</i>

570
00:55:24,308 --> 00:55:28,746
that black people,
black women in particular,

571
00:55:28,779 --> 00:55:31,816
we're expected to be seen,
not heard.

572
00:55:33,284 --> 00:55:35,219
Or we risk being perceived

573
00:55:35,252 --> 00:55:37,788
as threatening
to the patriarchy.

574
00:55:37,822 --> 00:55:39,991
Or, God forbid,

575
00:55:40,024 --> 00:55:45,229
we continue to get branded as
the "angry black woman."

576
00:55:45,262 --> 00:55:47,098
<i>Yes.</i>

577
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:51,068
So, the coping persona has
been this mode of survival

578
00:55:51,102 --> 00:55:54,171
for generations
of oppressed people.

579
00:55:54,205 --> 00:55:56,606
What I also learned
through those experiences

580
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,911
is within our authenticity
lies our real power.

581
00:56:00,945 --> 00:56:01,979
Yes.

582
00:56:02,013 --> 00:56:04,248
And that's even
in those environments,

583
00:56:05,216 --> 00:56:07,151
which by design,

584
00:56:07,184 --> 00:56:13,691
demand our complete
and total assimilation.

585
00:56:13,724 --> 00:56:16,761
To the patriarchy, we've
been practically invisible.

586
00:56:18,295 --> 00:56:22,632
But their arrogance is
their greatest vulnerability.

587
00:56:24,201 --> 00:56:27,071
And our greatest opportunity.

588
00:56:27,104 --> 00:56:28,773
Yes.

589
00:56:31,742 --> 00:56:33,944
And it brings me to a quote

590
00:56:33,978 --> 00:56:35,746
by Assata Shakur.

591
00:56:38,249 --> 00:56:42,619
"The only thing
that we have to lose

592
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:45,622
"are our chains."

593
00:56:46,924 --> 00:56:52,129
Liberation over assimilation.

594
00:56:52,163 --> 00:56:53,898
They're stuck in the past.

595
00:56:55,066 --> 00:56:57,368
- We are the future.
- Yes.

596
00:56:57,401 --> 00:56:59,136
Our time is now.

597
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:01,305
It's now.

598
00:57:01,338 --> 00:57:02,740
Right now.

599
00:57:09,646 --> 00:57:11,682
Just a reminder,
you can pick up

600
00:57:11,715 --> 00:57:14,085
<i>Shedding the Coping Persona</i>
on your way out.

601
00:57:14,118 --> 00:57:17,655
Twenty percent
goes to HBCU schools

602
00:57:17,688 --> 00:57:20,157
including Louisiana's own

603
00:57:20,191 --> 00:57:22,159
Dillard and Southern
Universities.

604
00:57:30,234 --> 00:57:32,303
The way that you
talked to them, the nuance,

605
00:57:32,336 --> 00:57:34,171
and there's a specificity
that I just can't...

606
00:57:34,205 --> 00:57:36,674
Oh, my God.
That was fantastic.

607
00:57:36,707 --> 00:57:39,343
So sorry.
That was really great, you know.

608
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:40,244
I really enjoyed
my session,

609
00:57:40,277 --> 00:57:41,946
but I'm really glad
I stayed for that.

610
00:57:41,979 --> 00:57:43,714
- Wasn't that fantastic?
- It was.

611
00:57:43,747 --> 00:57:45,249
- Camille, this is...
- I'm sorry, did I interrupt?

612
00:57:45,282 --> 00:57:46,350
- No...
- I'm gonna continue to.

613
00:57:46,383 --> 00:57:48,719
I really have to steal her.
Sorry to be abrupt.

614
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:49,787
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

615
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,988
Thank you again.

616
00:57:51,021 --> 00:57:52,356
I'm just gonna finish up
work and get back to... Bye.

617
00:57:52,389 --> 00:57:54,191
- Thank you, love.
- Great. Bye.

618
00:57:54,225 --> 00:57:56,193
- Hey.
- You're welcome.

619
00:57:56,227 --> 00:57:58,729
Girl, I could feel
her angling in

620
00:57:58,762 --> 00:58:00,231
on our dinner tonight.
And no thank you.

621
00:58:00,264 --> 00:58:02,133
She needs to go
sit down some place.

622
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:05,035
Plus, we could use
a break from academia.

623
00:58:05,069 --> 00:58:08,072
And also, how often
do I get my V?

624
00:58:08,739 --> 00:58:10,007
Twice a year?

625
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,442
- Maybe three times a year.
- I know, I know, I know.

626
00:58:11,475 --> 00:58:14,879
Okay, I need you all to
myself tonight. Okay?

627
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:16,780
No filter. Full Dawn.

628
00:58:16,814 --> 00:58:17,982
Oh, she comes
with a filter?

629
00:58:20,451 --> 00:58:22,052
Also, after dinner...

630
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:25,055
Yeah.

631
00:58:25,089 --> 00:58:27,858
You know, when we
leave dinner, it's on.

632
00:58:27,892 --> 00:58:30,461
We gonna be out in
these streets body rolling.

633
00:58:30,494 --> 00:58:31,695
- Oh, dinner. Tonight?
- Yes.

634
00:58:31,729 --> 00:58:34,832
I'm sorry, but I have a date
with my king bed tonight.

635
00:58:34,865 --> 00:58:36,066
I won't be joining.

636
00:58:36,834 --> 00:58:38,135
Whack. Wow.

637
00:58:38,169 --> 00:58:40,704
No. I have
a 6:00 a.m. flight.

638
00:58:40,738 --> 00:58:43,240
I promised Ken Ken I'd take
her to Katie's birthday party.

639
00:58:43,274 --> 00:58:45,843
Okay. All right.
It's fine.

640
00:58:45,876 --> 00:58:46,810
We will keep you abreast

641
00:58:46,844 --> 00:58:49,280
of all of our hoetivities
via text anyhow.

642
00:58:49,313 --> 00:58:51,749
Please do.
I wanna know everything.

643
00:58:51,782 --> 00:58:54,718
Girl, the hoetivity
is gonna be popping tonight.

644
00:58:54,752 --> 00:58:56,754
Girl, meet me down here
at 7:00 p.m.

645
00:58:56,787 --> 00:58:57,821
We'll Uber over, okay?

646
00:58:57,855 --> 00:59:00,891
Yes, 7:00 p.m.
And I have to go get dressed.

647
00:59:00,925 --> 00:59:02,159
Oh, speaking
of getting dressed,

648
00:59:02,193 --> 00:59:03,127
what are you
wearing tonight?

649
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,362
Do not come down here
in mom jeans, okay?

650
00:59:05,396 --> 00:59:06,797
I need all eyes
on our table

651
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:08,199
'cause I'm tryin'
to fuck tonight.

652
00:59:08,232 --> 00:59:10,467
You are on board
for that, okay?

653
00:59:10,501 --> 00:59:13,037
I won't disappoint.
Bye, girl.

654
00:59:25,149 --> 00:59:27,284
Well, hi. Don't you
look beautiful?

655
00:59:27,318 --> 00:59:29,186
Are you going
to the 49th floor, too?

656
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,823
Shh.

657
00:59:32,856 --> 00:59:35,793
You'll get in trouble
for talking.

658
00:59:36,293 --> 00:59:37,228
I'll get...

659
00:59:37,261 --> 00:59:40,464
Oh. I'll get in trouble
for talking? Okay.

660
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:41,932
Shh.

661
00:59:55,512 --> 00:59:57,448
Okay.

662
01:00:34,518 --> 01:00:36,387
You rang, darling?

663
01:00:39,857 --> 01:00:43,160
Girl, I said "Step it up,"
not murder these hoes.

664
01:00:43,193 --> 01:00:44,328
Mmm-mmm.

665
01:00:47,164 --> 01:00:48,432
Okay.
Here's a new concept.

666
01:00:48,465 --> 01:00:49,366
What do you think?

667
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,870
Instead of a "fuckboy,"
it's an "inti-mate."

668
01:00:52,903 --> 01:00:54,872
Okay, I love
everything about it.

669
01:00:54,905 --> 01:00:56,307
It's someone who's
gonna feed me ice cream

670
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,008
and knows how to soothe
my childhood trauma.

671
01:00:59,109 --> 01:01:00,944
It doesn't sound like
you need to take a Plan B

672
01:01:00,978 --> 01:01:02,046
with that guy at all.

673
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,514
- An inti-mate...
- I just want somebody

674
01:01:03,547 --> 01:01:04,581
to snuggle me at night.

675
01:01:04,615 --> 01:01:06,517
- That's all I want.
- You deserve.

676
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:08,285
- Is that so much to ask?
- You can call me.

677
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:09,987
You're
a great snuggler.

678
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:13,957
- I am a great snuggler.
- Oh, my God.

679
01:01:13,991 --> 01:01:16,093
What are you smiling at?
Who's that?

680
01:01:16,126 --> 01:01:18,162
Well,
you know it's Nick.

681
01:01:18,195 --> 01:01:20,397
Let's see.
Dick pics or no?

682
01:01:21,231 --> 01:01:22,366
Aw.

683
01:01:22,399 --> 01:01:23,434
Yeah.

684
01:01:23,467 --> 01:01:26,637
See, here I thought marital
bliss was an oxymoron.

685
01:01:26,671 --> 01:01:30,441
Guys, I can 100% confirm that
Nick is not that perfect.

686
01:01:30,474 --> 01:01:32,609
Trust, okay?

687
01:01:32,643 --> 01:01:34,978
- But he is kind of perfect for me.
- Yeah.

688
01:01:35,012 --> 01:01:36,347
- Ugh. Girl, she ruined it.
- There it is.

689
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,582
I thought there
was tea coming.

690
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:40,918
I miss my babies, okay?

691
01:01:40,951 --> 01:01:42,419
I'd miss him, too.

692
01:01:44,388 --> 01:01:46,290
"I miss my baby.

693
01:01:46,323 --> 01:01:47,991
- "Oh, he's so perfect for me."
- Please, guys.

694
01:01:48,025 --> 01:01:49,460
"He's so perfect for me.

695
01:01:49,493 --> 01:01:51,161
"He's my lobster.

696
01:01:51,195 --> 01:01:54,098
"He's the Chandler Bing
to my Monica."

697
01:01:54,131 --> 01:01:55,499
"He fits perfectly
in my little box."

698
01:01:58,102 --> 01:01:59,436
"Like a puzzle piece."

699
01:02:00,571 --> 01:02:02,606
Yeah, no, we're very happy

700
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:04,341
for you, bitch.

701
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:08,445
- All right. Time to live in the present.
- Okay, babe.

702
01:02:08,479 --> 01:02:09,480
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay.

703
01:02:11,683 --> 01:02:12,916
Damn.

704
01:02:14,284 --> 01:02:17,254
- Oh, my God. Okay.
- Shit, are you okay? Holy...

705
01:02:18,255 --> 01:02:21,091
<i>Hi.
Henley for three, please.</i>

706
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:24,628
We have your table.
Follow me.

707
01:02:40,344 --> 01:02:42,513
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Uh-uh. No, no, no, no.

708
01:02:42,546 --> 01:02:44,381
Sorry, I think what my friend
is trying to say is that...

709
01:02:44,415 --> 01:02:45,949
Actually, babe,
I got it.

710
01:02:45,983 --> 01:02:48,318
This table is 100%
not acceptable,

711
01:02:48,352 --> 01:02:50,487
and I think that you know
that, don't you...

712
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:52,322
...Becky? Mmm-hmm.

713
01:02:52,356 --> 01:02:54,525
Listen, I'm actually not gonna
go back and forth with you

714
01:02:54,558 --> 01:02:57,394
about exactly why this
table's unacceptable.

715
01:02:57,428 --> 01:02:59,430
You're gonna seat us
over there.

716
01:02:59,463 --> 01:03:00,564
Oh, um...

717
01:03:00,597 --> 01:03:02,499
Thank you
so much, Rebecca!

718
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:04,669
You're doing great!

719
01:03:04,702 --> 01:03:08,673
Yo, get your sis.
The Caucasity!

720
01:03:11,475 --> 01:03:14,211
- No, this is good.
- Well, then you're welcome.

721
01:03:14,244 --> 01:03:15,446
- Welcome.
- Hi.

722
01:03:15,479 --> 01:03:17,214
- Wine list. Hi.
- Thank you.

723
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:20,083
My name is Sam.
I'll be taking care of you this evening.

724
01:03:20,117 --> 01:03:22,619
- Will a fourth be joining you?
- No, just us.

725
01:03:22,654 --> 01:03:26,223
Very good. And may I start
you off with a cocktail?

726
01:03:26,256 --> 01:03:30,360
Actually, we will share
a bottle of champagne.

727
01:03:30,394 --> 01:03:33,597
How about a nice bottle
of prosecco?

728
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:36,668
A bottle of Armand de Brignac,
please. Thank you.

729
01:03:39,169 --> 01:03:41,104
Okay,
but more to the point,

730
01:03:41,138 --> 01:03:43,440
do you have any apt
prospects for the night?

731
01:03:43,474 --> 01:03:44,608
Mmm.

732
01:03:44,641 --> 01:03:47,511
Booked and busy,
actually.

733
01:03:47,544 --> 01:03:50,013
Actually, okay,
so there's this, um...

734
01:03:50,047 --> 01:03:51,582
Ooh, I've been trying
to set up a meeting

735
01:03:51,615 --> 01:03:53,150
with this guy, Justin.

736
01:03:53,183 --> 01:03:56,487
Fine. Just like
a dark chocolate,

737
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,555
like a 72% cacao, you know?

738
01:03:58,589 --> 01:04:00,390
Just...
Chef kiss.

739
01:04:00,424 --> 01:04:01,759
- Is he fine?
- Yes, he's fine.

740
01:04:01,793 --> 01:04:04,161
- Mmm.
- And he's got a friend.

741
01:04:04,194 --> 01:04:05,730
- For me, a friend?
- Yeah, for you.

742
01:04:05,763 --> 01:04:08,232
- Mmm. A friend?
- Mmm-hmm.

743
01:04:08,265 --> 01:04:10,133
I don't know. That sounds
sort of suspicious.

744
01:04:11,101 --> 01:04:12,704
Like, it can't be good.

745
01:04:12,737 --> 01:04:14,104
I feel like you're leading me
into the snake den with this.

746
01:04:14,137 --> 01:04:15,272
Girl,
I'm sure he's fine.

747
01:04:15,305 --> 01:04:16,674
- You're sure?
- Oh, my God.

748
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:18,041
- You're sure he's fine?
- You haven't even met him?

749
01:04:18,075 --> 01:04:19,076
No, I haven't met him.

750
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:21,311
Nope. This is exactly
what is not happening.

751
01:04:21,345 --> 01:04:22,479
- I am too grown for this.
- It's not...

752
01:04:22,513 --> 01:04:23,547
Okay, you're too grown.

753
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,148
No, got it. I feel blocked.

754
01:04:25,182 --> 01:04:28,085
I do. And that's okay.
'Cause you're grown.

755
01:04:28,118 --> 01:04:30,120
That's cool. It'll just
be you and me tonight

756
01:04:30,153 --> 01:04:31,823
and I will meet up
with fine-ass Justin

757
01:04:31,856 --> 01:04:33,758
some other time.
And maybe his friend, too.

758
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,526
Hey.

759
01:04:36,728 --> 01:04:39,096
Okay. Do not look.

760
01:04:40,097 --> 01:04:42,266
There is a guy at the bar...

761
01:04:42,299 --> 01:04:44,401
I said don't look.

762
01:04:44,434 --> 01:04:48,071
...that has been staring
at us the entire night,

763
01:04:48,105 --> 01:04:49,506
and it's creeping me out.

764
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,809
Excuse me, ladies.
Before we order entrees,

765
01:04:51,843 --> 01:04:54,111
I wanted to let you know
that the gentleman at the bar

766
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:56,113
sent this drink
specifically for you.

767
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,648
Oh.

768
01:05:00,517 --> 01:05:03,453
Specifically for me.

769
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,556
Oh, my God.
He's coming over here.

770
01:05:05,589 --> 01:05:07,491
And he's coming this way.

771
01:05:07,524 --> 01:05:08,760
Okay, all right.

772
01:05:08,793 --> 01:05:10,193
Pardon me, ladies.

773
01:05:11,796 --> 01:05:13,330
I've had my eye on you.

774
01:05:14,666 --> 01:05:16,199
I just had to come by
and tell you

775
01:05:16,233 --> 01:05:18,101
that I think
you're quite stunning.

776
01:05:21,572 --> 01:05:26,643
Oh, thank you. Oh, gosh,
I'm so flattered, thank you.

777
01:05:26,678 --> 01:05:30,380
You are extremely
handsome yourself.

778
01:05:30,414 --> 01:05:31,448
Thanks.

779
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:33,685
However, um,

780
01:05:33,718 --> 01:05:36,520
I'd be remiss if I didn't
take the chance to sort of

781
01:05:36,553 --> 01:05:39,189
critique your game
just a little bit.

782
01:05:39,222 --> 01:05:40,591
I'm sure that you can tell,

783
01:05:40,624 --> 01:05:41,659
even from all the way
over there,

784
01:05:41,693 --> 01:05:44,829
that we're actually
drinking champagne tonight.

785
01:05:44,862 --> 01:05:47,631
I am a champagne lady,

786
01:05:47,665 --> 01:05:51,134
and we are champagne ladies.

787
01:05:51,168 --> 01:05:55,572
So, sending over
a vodka-cran, yeah,

788
01:05:55,606 --> 01:05:57,909
it just shows
lack of appreciation

789
01:05:57,942 --> 01:06:01,311
for our situation
tonight, so...

790
01:06:01,345 --> 01:06:02,512
Well, what you should
have done is

791
01:06:02,546 --> 01:06:04,381
you should have
asked our waiter,

792
01:06:04,414 --> 01:06:07,150
which, again,
champagne we're drinking,

793
01:06:07,184 --> 01:06:10,587
and sent over a second bottle
of it for all of us.

794
01:06:10,621 --> 01:06:15,225
And then, you make eye contact
with me from across the room.

795
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:17,227
You eye-fuck me.

796
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:18,528
Oh, my God.

797
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:21,264
And I say
all that to say,

798
01:06:21,298 --> 01:06:24,334
Oop, here's my number.

799
01:06:24,368 --> 01:06:27,772
Because this can happen.

800
01:06:28,438 --> 01:06:29,640
Good night.

801
01:06:32,209 --> 01:06:33,243
Oh.

802
01:06:33,276 --> 01:06:34,611
Why did you
do him like that?

803
01:06:34,645 --> 01:06:37,481
You know why I did him
like that. He needed to know.

804
01:06:37,514 --> 01:06:39,416
Okay, I'm sorry,
but can we just take a second

805
01:06:39,449 --> 01:06:43,253
to acknowledge that that guy
was supernaturally fine.

806
01:06:43,286 --> 01:06:44,621
Yeah, he was really cute.

807
01:06:44,656 --> 01:06:46,356
So? I'm cute, too.

808
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:47,424
That's true.

809
01:06:47,457 --> 01:06:48,525
- You are cute.
- Yeah.

810
01:06:48,558 --> 01:06:50,728
Hey, to being cute and classy.

811
01:06:50,762 --> 01:06:52,764
- Yes. To being cute.
- To being fine as fuck.

812
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:57,601
Well,
I definitely look forward

813
01:06:57,634 --> 01:06:59,904
to catching up on this saga.

814
01:06:59,937 --> 01:07:02,339
On a group text,
in my bed.

815
01:07:02,372 --> 01:07:03,373
Very safe move.

816
01:07:03,407 --> 01:07:08,846
Wait. Although,
this hotel has been so off.

817
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,548
The front desk.
They didn't clean my room.

818
01:07:11,581 --> 01:07:13,685
So, I'm not even holding my
breath for turndown service.

819
01:07:13,718 --> 01:07:14,752
It's probably a mess.

820
01:07:14,786 --> 01:07:16,688
Really?
That's so strange.

821
01:07:16,721 --> 01:07:18,756
My service has
been impeccable.

822
01:07:21,959 --> 01:07:24,662
I got the Uber, but I can't
believe we're splitting up.

823
01:07:24,696 --> 01:07:26,363
- I know. I'm so sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.

824
01:07:26,396 --> 01:07:27,899
Before we split up,
we have to take a selfie.

825
01:07:27,932 --> 01:07:29,701
- Oh, yes.
- Let's get a picture.

826
01:07:29,734 --> 01:07:31,769
Because it did not happen
if it didn't happen...

827
01:07:31,803 --> 01:07:34,271
- You are right about that.
- ...in a selfie.

828
01:07:34,304 --> 01:07:35,840
Where's my lipstick?

829
01:07:35,873 --> 01:07:37,742
- Girl, you look fine.
- Your lips look fine.

830
01:07:37,775 --> 01:07:38,810
No, but I put it
in there.

831
01:07:38,843 --> 01:07:39,877
- I could've sworn.
- Come on, come on.

832
01:07:39,911 --> 01:07:42,279
- Okay.
- Get ready and...

833
01:07:44,448 --> 01:07:46,550
- All right, that's it.
- Tag me in that.

834
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:47,652
One-take wonders.
Everything.

835
01:07:47,685 --> 01:07:48,720
I love y'all.

836
01:07:48,753 --> 01:07:50,353
Thank you so much.

837
01:07:50,387 --> 01:07:51,388
One moment.

838
01:07:52,289 --> 01:07:54,025
- Love you.
- I love you.

839
01:07:54,058 --> 01:07:55,093
I'm so proud of you.

840
01:07:55,126 --> 01:07:58,261
- I love you. Get home safely.
- I love you so much.

841
01:07:58,295 --> 01:08:00,031
All right.
I hate I have to go.

842
01:08:00,064 --> 01:08:01,398
I have to get home
to my baby, though.

843
01:08:01,431 --> 01:08:02,566
Say hi to the family.

844
01:08:02,599 --> 01:08:04,836
All right. Love y'all.
Watch her.

845
01:08:04,869 --> 01:08:06,369
- You watch yourself.
- All night.

846
01:08:06,403 --> 01:08:08,973
- Watch her.
- You're gonna be in trouble.

847
01:08:09,006 --> 01:08:10,607
- Bye.
- Bye.

848
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,342
Goodbye.
Is this our car?

849
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:16,914
This is us. Let's go.

850
01:08:18,783 --> 01:08:22,385
The Montgomery Hotel, please.
I think I put it in.

851
01:08:22,419 --> 01:08:25,589
And do you mind turning
that down just a bit?

852
01:08:25,622 --> 01:08:26,623
Thank you.

853
01:08:33,064 --> 01:08:36,801
First off, that we are
some 5-star ladies.

854
01:08:36,834 --> 01:08:37,935
Aren't we, sister?

855
01:08:37,969 --> 01:08:40,004
And I just wanted
to comment

856
01:08:40,037 --> 01:08:41,839
that you look like
a 5-star gentleman.

857
01:08:41,873 --> 01:08:42,907
- Don't touch him.
- Is that too much?

858
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:43,975
- Don't touch him.
- I know.

859
01:08:44,008 --> 01:08:45,209
- I wanna have five stars.
- It's too much.

860
01:08:45,243 --> 01:08:48,345
I feel like that was too much.
I shouldn't... I'm sorry, Gus.

861
01:08:48,378 --> 01:08:49,613
I'm so sorry, Gary.

862
01:08:49,646 --> 01:08:51,281
Hey, put your...
Can you turn that up?

863
01:08:55,753 --> 01:08:58,522
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Veronica?</i>

864
01:08:58,555 --> 01:09:00,323
Who is this?

01:09:00,357 --> 01:09:01,793
<i>♪ Blame it on my juice</i>

<i>♪ Blame it, blame it

867
01:09:02,894 --> 01:09:03,928

<i>♪ Ya-ya eee ♪</i>

869
01:09:05,029 --> 01:09:06,063

01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,802
- Oh, there must be...
- <i>I'm outside of Stefano's.</i>

873
01:09:10,835 --> 01:09:13,070
Yeah, there must be a mistake.
I'm in my car right now.

874
01:09:13,104 --> 01:09:14,705
<i>I'm outside the restaurant.</i>

875
01:09:14,739 --> 01:09:16,339
No, there's a mistake.
I'm here now.

876
01:09:16,373 --> 01:09:17,708
- <i>Okay, whatever.</i>
- Thank you.

877
01:09:17,742 --> 01:09:21,746
Ma'am, do you mind turning
down the music, please?

878
01:09:24,481 --> 01:09:25,716
Hello!

879
01:09:34,859 --> 01:09:37,795
Turns out, this
color does look nice on me.

880
01:09:44,568 --> 01:09:47,738
Help! Help!

881
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,670
What do you want?
It's 3:00 a.m.

882
01:10:56,674 --> 01:10:58,876
The arrangements
are already being made.

883
01:11:00,811 --> 01:11:03,714
Now, look, the ballot box
will go our way.

884
01:11:03,748 --> 01:11:06,183
The court will follow
one way or another.

885
01:11:08,152 --> 01:11:10,453
It's under control.
Is there anything else?

886
01:11:15,059 --> 01:11:16,493
Oh, really?

887
01:11:18,963 --> 01:11:22,033
If I see her pathetic husband
on the news one more time

888
01:11:22,066 --> 01:11:24,101
parading around
that little girl...

889
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:27,905
Mouthy darkies are a plague.

890
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:31,075
I'll take care of it.

891
01:11:32,076 --> 01:11:34,111
I'll take care of it.

892
01:11:34,145 --> 01:11:37,580
I said I will fucking
take care of it.

893
01:12:06,077 --> 01:12:07,211
Eden?

894
01:12:16,187 --> 01:12:17,487
Eden?

895
01:12:33,938 --> 01:12:37,174
They will never take you
away from me.

896
01:13:43,941 --> 01:13:44,942
What'd I say?

897
01:13:49,246 --> 01:13:52,249
What the fuck did I say?

898
01:13:54,852 --> 01:13:57,354
I told her yesterday
she got one pass.

899
01:13:57,388 --> 01:13:58,322
Now she thinks
she can come down

900
01:13:58,355 --> 01:14:00,124
to the fields whenever
she goddamn pleases.

901
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:04,395
Well, she will learn
her lesson today.

902
01:14:04,428 --> 01:14:06,797
Girl, go get her.

903
01:14:07,765 --> 01:14:09,100
I can head up there, sir.

904
01:14:11,268 --> 01:14:13,270
Who gave you permission
to speak, boy?

905
01:14:15,072 --> 01:14:17,675
I gave myself
permission to speak.

906
01:16:02,513 --> 01:16:03,781
Tonight.

907
01:16:07,318 --> 01:16:10,454
We go tonight.

908
01:20:46,396 --> 01:20:47,431
I'm here.

909
01:20:57,307 --> 01:20:58,575
No, no, no...

910
01:21:11,488 --> 01:21:13,223
- Are you ready?
- Let's go.

911
01:21:14,591 --> 01:21:16,326
Wait. Wait.

912
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:25,469
Well, I'll be damned.

913
01:21:49,761 --> 01:21:51,094
You're killing me, man.

914
01:21:51,128 --> 01:21:52,129
Hey, dude,
what the hell?

915
01:21:58,302 --> 01:21:59,403
Hey, is this yours?

916
01:22:01,305 --> 01:22:02,306
No, Purcell,

917
01:22:02,339 --> 01:22:03,875
you know I know the rules,
man. No cell phones.

918
01:22:03,908 --> 01:22:07,144
- You fucking cuck.
- No cell... What?

919
01:22:07,177 --> 01:22:09,413
Don't say my fucking name out
here, Daniel!

920
01:22:09,914 --> 01:22:11,615
I'm sorry.

921
01:22:11,648 --> 01:22:13,483
I don't fucking want it.

922
01:22:13,517 --> 01:22:14,686
All right.

923
01:22:22,459 --> 01:22:25,128
You should
have seen your face.

924
01:22:33,838 --> 01:22:34,772
Yeah, I'm mad.

925
01:22:34,806 --> 01:22:36,340
I mean, she's talking
to me all the time.

926
01:22:36,373 --> 01:22:37,407
Well, no, you gotta

927
01:22:37,441 --> 01:22:38,542
stick up for yourself,
all right?

928
01:22:38,575 --> 01:22:39,610
- I know.
- You can't expect every...

929
01:22:39,643 --> 01:22:41,445
What was that?

930
01:22:41,478 --> 01:22:42,714
Well, it came
from that direction.

931
01:23:07,805 --> 01:23:09,640
Fuck!

932
01:23:09,674 --> 01:23:11,408
Man, you scared
the shit out of me.

933
01:23:11,441 --> 01:23:14,746
Oh, what is it?
The spooks got you spooked?

934
01:23:15,747 --> 01:23:16,781
It's nothing, man.

935
01:23:16,814 --> 01:23:19,449
There's no one
out here this late.

936
01:23:19,483 --> 01:23:22,586
Look at that moon,
though. Beautiful.

937
01:23:23,721 --> 01:23:27,157
Yeah. Well,
enjoy it, snowflake.

938
01:23:32,629 --> 01:23:34,264
Fine, you traitor.

939
01:23:34,297 --> 01:23:36,801
Yeah, yeah, write
about it in your diary, Romeo.

940
01:23:59,423 --> 01:24:01,959
I need to piss, man.
I'm gonna take a piss.

941
01:24:03,393 --> 01:24:05,697
Let me get these
fucking things off.

942
01:24:06,898 --> 01:24:07,799
Daniel.

943
01:24:07,832 --> 01:24:09,633
You're not supposed
to say my fucking...

944
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:15,272
- Get the damn phone.
- Got it.

945
01:24:19,443 --> 01:24:20,477
Oh, shit.

946
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:23,848
Listen,
if I don't make it,

947
01:24:24,782 --> 01:24:27,719
the world has to find out
about this place.

948
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,354
It has to end tonight.

949
01:24:32,589 --> 01:24:34,659
I know there's service
at the cabin.

950
01:24:35,392 --> 01:24:36,794
Let's go.

951
01:24:48,873 --> 01:24:49,907
Come on.

952
01:24:52,309 --> 01:24:54,578
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

953
01:24:55,913 --> 01:24:57,547
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

954
01:24:58,482 --> 01:25:01,953
My name is Veronica Henley.

955
01:25:01,986 --> 01:25:05,656
I have been kidnapped.
There are so many of us here.

956
01:25:05,690 --> 01:25:06,791
We're on some
sort of plantation.

957
01:25:06,824 --> 01:25:07,624
<i>I'm sorry,
ma'am, you're breaking up.</i>

958
01:25:07,658 --> 01:25:09,426
I need you
to send help right now.

959
01:25:09,459 --> 01:25:10,494
<i>Did you say "plantation"?</i>

960
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:12,529
Hello? Hello?

961
01:25:24,407 --> 01:25:27,712
We need his face
to unlock this phone.

962
01:25:28,746 --> 01:25:31,548
That's the only way
we can send our location.

963
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:40,423
I got you.

964
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

965
01:27:31,669 --> 01:27:33,637
No fuckin' loyalty!

966
01:27:38,776 --> 01:27:40,111
Eden!

967
01:27:41,879 --> 01:27:45,016
My name is Veronica!

968
01:28:03,267 --> 01:28:05,069
Open your eyes, motherfucker.

969
01:28:06,671 --> 01:28:10,007
I said, open your
motherfuckin' eyes!

970
01:28:26,824 --> 01:28:27,825
<i>Hello?</i>

971
01:28:28,659 --> 01:28:29,794
Nick?

972
01:28:29,827 --> 01:28:32,930
<i>V? V!</i>

973
01:28:32,964 --> 01:28:34,932
I'm okay. I'm alive.

974
01:28:34,966 --> 01:28:38,501
<i>V, no. No, no, no.
Tell me exactly where you are.</i>

975
01:28:38,535 --> 01:28:40,537
I don't know,
but I'm getting out.

976
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:43,573
<i>Oh, my God. Everyone has
been searching for you.</i>

977
01:28:43,606 --> 01:28:44,809
I can't talk right now.

978
01:28:44,842 --> 01:28:48,578
I need you to call the police, now.
I'm gonna send you a pin.

979
01:28:48,611 --> 01:28:50,281
- <i>Mommy!</i>
- Oh.

980
01:28:50,314 --> 01:28:52,116
- <i>Okay, okay, V. No.</i>
- Baby.

981
01:28:52,149 --> 01:28:53,918
- <i>No, stay with me.</i>
- I love...

982
01:28:53,951 --> 01:28:55,485
Hello?

983
01:29:05,663 --> 01:29:08,799
Come on. No. No, no, no.

984
01:29:35,592 --> 01:29:36,961
Professor.

985
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:40,530
I'm sorry.

986
01:31:26,470 --> 01:31:28,305
This doesn't end here.

987
01:31:31,842 --> 01:31:33,210
We're nowhere

988
01:31:35,846 --> 01:31:37,414
and everywhere.

989
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

990
01:31:49,727 --> 01:31:51,061
What the fuck are you doin'
out of your cabin?

991
01:31:51,095 --> 01:31:52,263
It's the general, sir.
He's hurt.

992
01:31:52,296 --> 01:31:53,931
- Please come quick.
- Wait.

993
01:31:53,964 --> 01:31:55,833
- Come quick. He's hurt.
- God!

994
01:31:55,866 --> 01:31:57,735
Oh, God. Oh.

995
01:31:57,768 --> 01:31:59,870
Jesus Christ. Senator?

996
01:31:59,904 --> 01:32:01,739
Senator Denton! Sir?

997
01:32:03,774 --> 01:32:05,843
Eden! Hey! Eden?

998
01:32:07,077 --> 01:32:08,646
Eden, open this door!

999
01:32:09,046 --> 01:32:10,447
Shh.

1000
01:32:11,949 --> 01:32:14,185
Please,
open the fuckin' door.

1001
01:32:14,218 --> 01:32:17,288
Open the door.
Jesus fuckin'...

1002
01:32:17,321 --> 01:32:19,256
Eden, open this
fuckin' door right now!

1003
01:32:19,290 --> 01:32:20,824
Open the door!

1004
01:32:20,858 --> 01:32:22,126
No, Veronica!

1005
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:23,394
Veronica, Veronica,
listen to me.

1006
01:32:23,427 --> 01:32:26,397
Please. Veronica!

1007
01:32:26,430 --> 01:32:27,765
What the fuck
is she doing?

1008
01:32:27,798 --> 01:32:29,033
Open that
fuckin' door!

1009
01:32:31,302 --> 01:32:33,003
No! Get it off!

1010
01:33:00,231 --> 01:33:01,498
The hell is that?

1011
01:33:01,532 --> 01:33:02,933
Go on, mount up!
Let's go!

1012
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:09,940
Get, girl! Get!

1013
01:33:28,592 --> 01:33:30,160
Get, girl!

1014
01:33:43,941 --> 01:33:45,276
Eden!

1015
01:33:55,052 --> 01:33:56,086
Get, girl!

1016
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,035
Eden!

1017
01:34:16,507 --> 01:34:17,875
Eden!

1018
01:34:22,346 --> 01:34:24,415
You're not gonna
get out of here alive.

1019
01:34:24,448 --> 01:34:26,517
Now, why can't you
just accept that?

1020
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:29,286
Accept what you are.

1021
01:34:30,988 --> 01:34:32,489
You are nothin'.

1022
01:34:34,958 --> 01:34:37,227
You ain't nothin',
but a cotton picker.

1023
01:34:39,296 --> 01:34:41,398
You think you're
better than us,

1024
01:34:44,101 --> 01:34:46,537
but you ain't better than me,
you fuckin' cunt!

1025
01:34:49,206 --> 01:34:51,575
My father kept insistin'.

1026
01:34:53,177 --> 01:34:55,479
He said you were
spreadin' such filth!

1027
01:34:57,081 --> 01:34:58,949
I told him you weren't
worth the risk,

1028
01:35:01,485 --> 01:35:03,887
but he couldn't resist.

1029
01:35:03,921 --> 01:35:05,489
The movement be damned!

1030
01:35:06,557 --> 01:35:08,225
He just had to have you.

1031
01:35:08,258 --> 01:35:10,961
Every single one of you
I picked,

1032
01:35:11,528 --> 01:35:13,230
except for you.

1033
01:35:14,264 --> 01:35:16,066
His favorite girl.

1034
01:35:19,269 --> 01:35:23,273
Now, of course, like always,

1035
01:35:23,307 --> 01:35:26,276
it's up to a woman
to clean up the mess of a man.

1036
01:35:28,078 --> 01:35:29,113
Eden?

1037
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:35,486
Get your black ass out here!

1038
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:54,706
Get the fuck up.

1039
01:35:54,739 --> 01:35:57,274
Get the fuck up.

1040
01:35:57,307 --> 01:35:58,409
Get the fuck up!

1041
01:36:45,322 --> 01:36:49,193
What kind of woman are you?

1042
01:37:11,749 --> 01:37:13,383
Get, girl, Get.

1043
01:37:24,328 --> 01:37:26,330
Go, Daphne. Get, girl.

1044
01:41:55,235 --> 01:42:00,235
