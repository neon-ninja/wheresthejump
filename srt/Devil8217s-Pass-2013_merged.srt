1
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:08,323
These are the facts:

2
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:24,574
In February 1959, 9
Russian travelers ventured in the Urals

3
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,680
Two weeks later, all
nine were found dead.

4
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:39,081
Became known as the Incident Dyatlov Step.

5
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,482
- Okay, go.
- My name is Holly King.

6
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:50,213
I am a student of psychology
at the University of Oregon.

7
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:59,225
Gathered in a remote area
in the Ural Mountains in Russia

8
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:04,143
trying to solve the mystery that devastated
the world for nearly 50 years

9
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:07,306
known as "Incident Dyatlov Step"

10
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:12,101
thanks to leader
1959 expedition, Igor Dyatlov.

11
00:02:12,117 --> 00:02:13,307
They failed.

12
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:15,374
But I was struck by the story

13
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,584
and when my favorite teacher,
Dr. Kittles spoke at room

14
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,904
On a project dealing with the
incident, did not believe.

15
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:25,898
Commented to a friend, Jenson,
a film student here

16
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:28,957
and he said that we should make a movie

17
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:32,173
then ask a purse, and...

18
00:02:32,174 --> 00:02:33,803
Achieved.

19
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:36,138
Okay, then...

20
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:37,956
What happened?

21
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:42,187
I heard the first time about the incident
by a Russian journalist, Yuri

22
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:45,442
who published a fictionalized
version of a book of sci-fi

23
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,831
"The Highest Level of
Complexity Yuri Yarovoi"

24
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,030
Sure he had him killed.

25
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:54,055
Russian writer Yuri Yarovoi
crashed into a empty road on 01/28/1980.

26
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:56,421
No matter who has fictionalized the facts

27
00:02:56,438 --> 00:02:59,973
they do not want anyone
talking about Dyatlov.

28
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:04,066
And I started to use the "incident"
as an exercise teaching in psychology

29
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:07,837
Because there is a lot to know
what happened in Dyatlov Pass

30
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:09,547
in such detail

31
00:03:09,548 --> 00:03:12,643
and whole thing still remains
shrouded in mystery.

32
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,464
What explanations usually used?

33
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,584
The most common explanations
call "scientific"

34
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:22,422
is a disease called dementia hypothermia...

35
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:23,976
Dementia hypothermia

36
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:26,800
this is literally the most widely used,

37
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:29,105
but my preferred

38
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:30,639
is called...

39
00:03:30,662 --> 00:03:32,797
"Paradoxical undressing".

40
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:36,216
It's something that happens with
severe hypothermia sufferers,

41
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:41,083
disoriented, think they are
overheated and bare all.

42
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,436
Holly, 9 were experienced there,

43
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:49,266
tells me that they all
had hypothermia severe

44
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:53,592
while the same night?

45
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:57,666
They were out 3 days ago,
because at that moment?

46
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:01,645
An avalanche is another frequent response.

47
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:03,795
This, is even more stupid

48
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:05,906
than "paradoxical undressing".

49
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:10,936
Hearing the avalanche would be the
3 hours out camping without boots?

50
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:14,907
But after entering answers
the question nameless

51
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,451
my students will introduce their own fears

52
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,572
The Russian army?

53
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:22,666
I hope my students
propose something more believable...

54
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,479
I want to put them in place of those people

55
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:31,136
to understand why
victims did what they did,

56
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,640
this is the answer we seek.

57
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:35,259
Let's find out the truth?

58
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:40,545
- You know you'll never find out.
- What?

59
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,054
There is no truth.

60
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:51,387
The first leg of our journey will
Eugene-Oregon-Chelyabinsk Russia.

61
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:56,039
Not going to use those stupid dotted
to show the journey, right?

62
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,674
Wrong!

63
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:01,857
The last destination is Kholat Syakhl,

64
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:06,017
literally translated as
"the Mountain of the Dead."

65
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:08,216
Seriously!

66
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:12,536
The name takes into account the
numerous mysterious deaths

67
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:16,067
and disappearances
throughout history, so...

68
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:20,706
Find an audio engineer, Denise Evers.

69
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:26,158
The only operator on campus
audio that fills... physical requirements.

70
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,377
Bunch of skinny guys in Audio.

71
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:32,430
What's wrong with skinny?

72
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:34,611
Ah, sorry, was wrong.

73
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:37,417
And then we found two capable guides.

74
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:42,112
Andy Thatcher, President of
Northwest Trails Association...

75
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:45,557
Climbed all the mountains of the
USA, and also mochilei by TA.

76
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:48,355
- Forgiveness?
- The Appalachian Trail,

77
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:51,562
stretches from Maine to Georgia
I went in the summer.

78
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:55,354
- So you think you realize that?
- Yes

79
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:57,302
Why would you do that?

80
00:05:57,321 --> 00:06:02,483
No more I can climb
U.S., is a challenge for me.

81
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:05,262
- Are you afraid?
- No.

82
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:08,809
You know, recreate a trip
where 9 people died.

83
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:12,588
50 years ago, come on?
Not the Snowman.

84
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:14,831
- Yeti!
- He's gone now.

85
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,643
- And you are?
- Is JP Hauser.

86
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:18,932
- JP.
- I drew.

87
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:21,071
You think you're ready for this?

88
00:06:21,072 --> 00:06:23,920
This guy was here
in Himalayas, is ready.

89
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:25,330
- Really?
- Yes

90
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:29,065
- I took some time off.
- A long time off.

91
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:34,771
What kind of Hauser?
Hauser Hall?

92
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:38,130
Type construction that we are facing?

93
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:40,011
A itself.

94
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:44,332
This reminds me of my philosophy,
I take care of children after!

95
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:47,945
We have our team, it's time to work
:

96
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,981
studied maps, prepare gear and join
chopped and supplies

97
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:55,543
and then trained in the local mountains,

98
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:59,853
are excited and eager to go.

99
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:04,598
- I hate those snowshoes.
- It is so cool with them, Jenson.

100
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:08,093
Hey, what do you think of these boots?

101
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:14,376
Almost all hate that.

102
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,232
Shit!

103
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:20,694
Now, January 25...

104
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:23,726
Is time to leave.

105
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:28,420
Still looking for 5 students
missing last month

106
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:30,356
in the Urals.

107
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:34,673
Remember that three days
rescuers found items

108
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:39,505
to be students, tents, backpacks
and other equipment.

109
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:45,049
Ivan, our Russian correspondent
Channel 24 has more information.

110
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:50,357
Good afternoon, I'm Ivan Kudryavtsev
and you're watching the Russia-Canal24,

111
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:55,302
continue following the event that occupies
the attention of the international media

112
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:57,835
and the news is more
commented in Russia

113
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,946
the disappearance of the Ural Mountains
a group of American documentary filmmakers

114
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:07,436
that, as you may know, followed the
steps of the expedition Igor Dyatlov

115
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:14,163
9 whose members died in mysterious
circumstances in 1959.

116
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,110
Experts
raise several theories for disappearances.

117
00:08:18,142 --> 00:08:22,911
I think I made contact with aliens,
a ship or something...

118
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:28,976
In recent years there have been
several interesting phenomena on site.

119
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:32,652
The more I study the place, date
mysterious signs and...

120
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:34,966
And sinister, even mystical,

121
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:39,493
area is shrouded in mystery, which feeds
such theories, even the mystic

122
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:47,171
are understandable because has long been
reports that testify objects in the sky

123
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:52,764
and today this area is common
reports of Yeti footprints.

124
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:57,266
Also a native tribe, ethnicity
Mansi, have their own theory.

125
00:08:57,284 --> 00:09:01,557
An elder Mansi remember that when
group Dyatlov disappeared,

126
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,414
Native reported noises and balls
of fire over the mountains.

127
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:09,532
Believe that place...

128
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:12,756
Is where two worlds collide...

129
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:19,159
where you can pass from
one world to another...

130
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:24,133
Is where
enters the world of spirits.

131
00:09:24,134 --> 00:09:27,377
The Canal24-24 Russia continues to inform

132
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:31,127
recent disappearances
in the northern Urals,

133
00:09:31,143 --> 00:09:36,161
where 5 U.S. documentary filmmakers
disappeared mysteriously

134
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:41,259
in the same place, in 1959, the group
Igor Dyatlov died.

135
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:48,213
Thank you, Ivan.

136
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:53,437
Students recreated the ill-fated journey
seized by Igor Dyatlov

137
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,416
8 and other Russian explorers
50 years ago for a documentary.

138
00:09:57,423 --> 00:10:01,262
The most promising clue is found
equipment team recording

139
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:05,333
Experts watched the footage without
disclose it in the press, but today,

140
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:10,192
a group of hackers calling themselves
ConspiraLeaks gained access to footage

141
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,322
and posted on their web-site.

142
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:16,615
I opened the door and darkness
followed me, and in my dream.

143
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:19,192
Hey, come on.
Hey, hey, hey.

144
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:22,304
- It was just a dream, just a dream.
- Excuse me.

145
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:25,611
Jenson, never leave here.

146
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,096
Excuse me...

147
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:41,982
One month before

148
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:49,444
We arrived to Russia and the next
point of our journey is Chelyabinsk

149
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,607
and then to the Urals, into a city called
Ivdel.

150
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:57,514
- Beautiful tattoo, angel! Has another wing?
- It's unique, and it hurt like hell.

151
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:01,223
Anything else I should know,
something you want to show to the camera?

152
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:03,837
Keep dreaming, pervert.
And this phone?

153
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:09,051
It is equipped with GPS universal,
and where there is no signal,

154
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,413
here GPS navigates
anywhere in the world.

155
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:14,223
Cool!

156
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:18,579
Sorry, can not help
know I did not bring fluid.

157
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:22,004
- Do not do it.
- Talking to the camera?

158
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:24,701
Chatting with Lucile.

159
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:26,333
Really?
Type a girl?

160
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:29,463
Filmmaker
are quite connected in their cameras.

161
00:11:29,464 --> 00:11:32,352
No power, baby, she's jealous.

162
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:35,401
- Thank you.
- Quite linked...

163
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,979
Thank you.

164
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:47,730
What do you think? Think will put
backpacks and spend the week?

165
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:52,256
Is a test, you know?
Man against the elements.

166
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:55,466
Millennia People survive without
these things happening,

167
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,615
just do everything right,
and I bet you will.

168
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,392
Your confidence is daunting.

169
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:04,265
Enters those without trust,
you will not return.

170
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:07,527
And you, JP?

171
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:12,806
I thought well,
and live only once,

172
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:16,216
want to try to see and
do as much as possible,

173
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:19,132
I have everything I need in
backpack for months...

174
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:22,189
- That?
- For years, maybe. Yes, that.

175
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:24,595
How many people can say that?

176
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:27,266
I hope that does not need much.

177
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:31,638
- Yes, you never know.
- Never know.

178
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:41,303
We spent Monday in Ivdel,
then we can interview Piotr Karov,

179
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:47,055
the 10th member of the Dyatlov, who
got sick on the first day and came back,

180
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:52,661
shortly after he had a breakdown and
came to this Psychiatric Hospital.

181
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:58,414
Back.
Stop the camera!

182
00:12:58,454 --> 00:13:00,355
Hey, hey,
does not touch the camera!

183
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:01,963
Turn it off!

184
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,949
- No recordings!
- Yeah, tell that to the camera!

185
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:08,754
- Go away, please!
- The Cold War is over, we're friends.

186
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,001
We can not interview
Piotr Karov?

187
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,348
- He died. Now go.
- What?

188
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:16,345
- How did he die?
- Go!

189
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:20,613
- Friendly, no?
- Holly, in the upstairs window!

190
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:23,499
What?
Is it?

191
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:29,018
- I can not understand.
- Oh! Ow!

192
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:31,769
It was Karov?
What did he say?

193
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:34,972
- Have you seen?
- What the hell!

194
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:47,497
I know I look like Jenson, but I
believe I saw Piotr Karov that window,

195
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:50,425
and I really want to know
what they tried to show,

196
00:13:50,444 --> 00:13:53,447
but could not,
and trains do not go here

197
00:13:53,463 --> 00:13:57,467
Try to ride Vizhaj,
let's start backpacking.

198
00:13:57,489 --> 00:14:02,254
Best Jenson unless U.S. ambassador,
could restart the Cold War.

199
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:05,625
Okay, these guys say
bar here has a native

200
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:09,944
then we should give because there
has a native, the family is Vizhaj

201
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:12,788
are we can get a ride,
sounds good?

202
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:16,828
- Come on.
- Bar does not sound good.

203
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:20,085
- It's the wrong way!
- No, this is where we should go.

204
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,302
That's what I was talking about! Jenson
1 0 Andy.

205
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:27,069
Look, accept dogs,
Company home.

206
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,712
- Hilarious!
- Calm!

207
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:31,479
Holly, you know because it has no
drunk driver in Russia?

208
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,370
- No. - Yeah, give!
- Hey, a photo! Come on!

209
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:37,187
- Yes!
- I timer on the camera.

211
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:42,777
Come on!

212
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,516
- A... - Xis. - Two... - Three...
- West Coast!

213
00:14:56,298 --> 00:14:58,350
Do you speak English?

214
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,525
Course.

215
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:02,646
- Something to drink?
- Yes, please!

216
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,401
Jenson, looked for a ride.

217
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:09,670
We are young beautiful people
foreign land who would like a drink.

218
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:12,241
- Where are they going?
- Vizhaj.

219
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,300
And then that drink?

220
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:17,034
Vizhaj?

221
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:19,046
Why?

222
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:23,308
We are making a documentary about
the incident from Step Dyatlov.

223
00:15:23,324 --> 00:15:24,895
Ah...

224
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,909
So should try it!

225
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:33,870
- What's in there?
- VIP gentlemen.

226
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:36,237
- Here comes the shot!
- Shooting? Oh, no.

00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:41,531
Owe me a special favor,
anyone have a cigarette?

228
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:45,246
Looks like they're having fun.

229
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:51,394
- Beautiful... - Memorable bottle, huh?
- Beautiful bottle.

230
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:56,353
- God, she smelled?
- Yes!

231
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,028
Fede.

232
00:15:58,564 --> 00:16:00,913
- Maybe not so full.
- Chora!

233
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,087
They are great!

234
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:08,414
Let us then!

235
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,521
- Then I start?
- Wait, wait!

236
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:18,140
God, what a mess.

237
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:21,240

- Gonna mess with me, kid.

238
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,941

- Thank you.
- "In zdorovje"

241
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:32,692
What?

242
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:36,243
I mean, I know nothing about the people,
culture, history or women

243
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:39,504
Russia but did my duty as
home to good manners.

244
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:42,441
- So... cheers!
- Cheers guys!

245
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:51,631
Shit heavy!

246
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:54,571
You guys are viadinhos?

247
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:56,771
- What is it?
- Well ..

248
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:59,822
- Sa-ma-gon.
- Samagon.

249
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,328
Like a drop coaster.

250
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:04,536
Yes, because it served Samagon?

251
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:07,134
Serve them right here.

252
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:09,809
- Before leaving.
- Who? Who are they?

253
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:13,033
Dyatlov!
Drank it before leaving.

254
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,949
Stop it.
Not funny.

255
00:17:24,973 --> 00:17:28,857
- There is an omen, right?
- No, it's just a coincidence.

256
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,487
- We want another round, friend.
- Yes!

257
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:35,188
- Get down! - Making a movie?
- That's right.

00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:37,849
- And going Vizhaj?
- Yes

259
00:17:37,872 --> 00:17:40,892
Yes, you know how to get there?

260
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:43,226
'll Take you.

261
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:45,262
Go?
All right.

262
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:47,124
Leave tomorrow!

263
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,038
- Yes - Yes
- And take all?

264
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:51,625
No problem.

265
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,518
I said it would work.

266
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,843
Okay, serve this guy a drink?

267
00:17:55,862 --> 00:17:58,608
- A drink. - What do you want?
- Vodka.

268
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,946
Thank you very much.

269
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,688
No problem, I'm Sergei.

270
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:07,787
See, not so bad.

271
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:14,321
- Who let Jenson go ahead?
- At least we have the girls, bro!

272
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,360
- Keep dreaming.
- How far is...?

273
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:19,975
Vizhaj.
Some 40 miles (65kms).

274
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:22,880
Forty?
Great.

275
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:27,168
At least we have enough potatoes for stupid
chew.

276
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:53,154
- Denise, let's go!
- Guys?

277
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,457
My eyes froze shut!

278
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:58,479
Not funny.
What do I do?

279
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,614
- Wait, do not move.
- Take it easy on her, Andy!

280
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,715
- Hold on!
- Shit.

281
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:09,401
Expected, the other!

282
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,781
There is.
Everything okay?

283
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:18,043
Yes Thanks.

284
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:30,199
Cold here? I feel that...
You're...

285
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:33,176
- Feels like... cold.
- Okay, let's go!

286
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:36,543
No, man!
Not cool.

287
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:41,498
- I'll give you $ 100 if you lick the bumper!
- I'll give you a dollar sucking JP.

288
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:43,548
Come on, guys!

289
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:47,873
Hey, will love it. I found that
Sergei came to visit her aunt.

290
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:49,503
Wow, that too!

291
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,514
No, she was part of the first
rescuers to see Dyatlov.

292
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:55,857
- Wait, seriously?
- Yes

293
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:59,991
- I asked her to speak if they want
- Yes, I do!

294
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,847
- I want.
- I'll be in the movie, right?

295
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,192
- You bet!
- She speaks English?

296
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,119
Better than I!

297
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:09,563
Can you translate something for me?

298
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,161
- Here, take the camera.
- Yes, of course.

299
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:15,953
Let's go and find her aunt.

300
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:18,358
- What's her name?
- Alya.

301
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:20,432
She is a teacher.

302
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:24,867
What is this?

303
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,299
Piotr The name arose.

304
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:41,266
- Like this?
- Yeah, I guess.

305
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,865
What does it mean?

306
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:47,803
Stay away!

307
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,349
Tell us what happened.

308
00:20:52,363 --> 00:20:57,543
My brother Vallik, father
Sergei, found the first body,

309
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:01,550
still remember how he screamed,

310
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,751
when he returned later.

311
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,672
Proceed.

312
00:21:15,214 --> 00:21:19,100
Did not take long to find the others,

313
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,343
track...

314
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:27,806
A trail of corpses...

315
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:31,921
Find two

316
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:34,925
and woman

317
00:21:34,956 --> 00:21:38,677
a trail to campfire set up where

318
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:41,636
there we two

319
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,515
and four, in the ravine.

320
00:21:48,499 --> 00:21:50,543
We were so sad,

321
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:54,533
but not surprised

322
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:57,157
when we discovered

323
00:21:57,968 --> 00:22:00,631
there were no survivors,

324
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:07,222
but it was so weird...

325
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:10,538
I felt,

326
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:13,731
people got nervous...

327
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:16,475
I felt so,

328
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:21,534
had something wrong with the place,

329
00:22:24,514 --> 00:22:28,952
I left there wanting to get rid of it
,

330
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:32,396
was when I found two more

331
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:35,162
on the north side.

332
00:22:35,949 --> 00:22:38,572
There was something wrong with them,

333
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,780
more than others,

334
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:44,923
and something...

335
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:47,597
Snow near them.

336
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,324
A machine!

337
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:57,683
- As strange.
- Excuse me.

338
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:00,151
Let...
Cut a minute.

339
00:23:00,175 --> 00:23:02,887
So found 11 bodies.

340
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:05,988
-
Yes - Are you sure?

341
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,804
I know what I saw, young lady,

342
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:15,516
'll never forget.

343
00:23:16,116 --> 00:23:22,554
But the reports, photos of
scene, all report only 9.

344
00:23:22,555 --> 00:23:24,187
So what?

345
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:29,441
Believe what everyone tells you to believe

346
00:23:30,047 --> 00:23:33,108
or else believe in your own heart?

347
00:23:36,496 --> 00:23:38,511
'll Leave them a trail next.

348
00:23:38,512 --> 00:23:40,807
Not like we have

349
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:47,560
- I told you!
- Did what?

350
00:23:47,582 --> 00:23:49,932
Aliens!
What else can it be?

351
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:54,613
And the military? You said
conducted an experiment with them.

352
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:59,792
- Well then change my vote pros aliens.
- Yes, it makes much more sense, Jenson

353
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:05,842
And you, Andy? The think the
theory of aliens Jenson?

354
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:11,019
- Stupid.
- It is the silent type, huh?

355
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,965
I do not think Andy agrees with his theory.

356
00:24:15,842 --> 00:24:17,850
Whatever.

357
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:21,158
Do not get me shoot?
Shoots mountains.

358
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:23,747
Sounds interesting, JP.

359
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:36,233
Hey, Andy!
Denise did not take his eyes off you.

360
00:24:36,264 --> 00:24:40,768
Yes, your eyes say:
Oh, Jesus!

361
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,894
What an idiot!

362
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:49,841
So, guys, it's all what they expected
?

363
00:24:49,858 --> 00:24:52,071
-
Yes - Oh, yes.

364
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:55,488
!
The words lost?

365
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:58,009
Is this?

366
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,857
- This what?
- "Kholat Syakhl"

367
00:25:00,878 --> 00:25:02,882
Yes

368
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:08,208
The Mountain of the Dead!

369
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,180
Jesus!

370
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:18,841
As you can see, the weather changes quickly
,

371
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:20,886
and changed.

372
00:25:22,374 --> 00:25:24,378
My racquet again!

373
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,862
Piece of shit.

374
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:33,565
- We could die here.
- Better go before nightfall.

375
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,520
- The weather will change.
- Jenson!

376
00:25:35,544 --> 00:25:38,384
- Yo! - Just one more picture!
- Come!

377
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:41,582
Guys, this is too much!

378
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:57,905
So Mr. Hauser, which tricks
cooking at camp?

379
00:25:58,951 --> 00:26:04,256
Well, I like to do
as simple as possible, so...

380
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:11,357
You have to Dried Mountain Chili...
delicious.

381
00:26:11,358 --> 00:26:13,763
You know I'm vegetarian, right?

382
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,959
- Really?
- Yes

383
00:26:16,682 --> 00:26:20,572
Do not know...

384
00:26:22,968 --> 00:26:25,689
Okay, so let bottled water?

385
00:26:25,705 --> 00:26:27,450
Is using the snow?

386
00:26:27,465 --> 00:26:32,322
We need fresh water, but without
drama: the snow boiling kills bacteria.

387
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:35,476
- Smell amazing.
- JP, his master cook.

388
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:37,274
Wait but...

389
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:39,481
Will burn your mouth.

390
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:43,228
Idiot!

00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:58,481
- Looks tasty.
- Is it all the time?

396
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:03,342

398
00:27:07,412 --> 00:27:10,920

00:27:10,948 --> 00:27:13,533
Thank you.

00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:16,244
- Life-Size.

401
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:19,278
- I can show you later if you want.
- Sure can.

402
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:21,608
How many nights

403
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,400
Two.

404
00:27:30,634 --> 00:27:32,448
Tasty.

405
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:34,695
How's the pepperoni?

406
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:36,121
Good

407
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,080
- Want?
- No, thank you.

408
00:27:38,765 --> 00:27:40,407
Oh Jenson

00:27:40,418 --> 00:27:42,603

410
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:48,228
- This is sexy.
- Is sexy?

411
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:52,549
How's your first experience on a film set
professional?

412
00:27:52,565 --> 00:27:54,640
And this is a professional set?

413
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:57,717
This? It's the best set
which could start.

414
00:27:57,729 --> 00:28:00,488
It's cool, but what about you?
As thought was backpacking?

415
00:28:00,498 --> 00:28:03,592
- I thought it was good, easy.
- It? - I need sleep...

416
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:06,586
And gives you backpacking,
and gives you mountains.

417
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:09,614
Hoped to lead the expedition tomorrow.

418
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,482
Food can not stick with it.

419
00:28:12,504 --> 00:28:15,974
- Think, smart!
- It's a dick, is not understood.

420
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,087
But guess
feel the difference, huh?

421
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:21,513
Jesus Christ.

422
00:28:21,522 --> 00:28:23,247
And hearing this, 'm satisfied.

423
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:26,743
- Do not want to hear.
- If called hilarious. - Really?

424
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:29,302
Is not it beautiful?

425
00:28:29,317 --> 00:28:31,151
What?

426
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:33,195
The aurora borealis.

427
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,684
Oh, right.

428
00:28:38,027 --> 00:28:40,034
Yeah, well...

429
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,724
Adorable.

430
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:46,194
- How is your tongue?
- Well

431
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:55,151
Now, forget the aurora borealis,
Garner Denise is there.

432
00:28:55,175 --> 00:29:00,140
Believe me, I'm not interested
in perverting Denise moment.

433
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,473
Okay, what are you doing?

434
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:09,679
Week Incident reported
orange lights in the sky,

435
00:29:09,702 --> 00:29:12,342
six witnesses totally different.

436
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:15,656
- Aliens?
- Is what most think,

437
00:29:15,682 --> 00:29:20,696
the official report was "unusual
atmospheric conditions"

438
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:25,146
Light of reflected light in
clouds or something.

439
00:29:25,714 --> 00:29:28,746
- But I do not believe it?
- Hey, is not sleep?

440
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:31,073
Start early tomorrow.

441
00:29:31,097 --> 00:29:33,248
- Okay.
- What?

442
00:29:34,102 --> 00:29:35,885
The big day.

443
00:29:35,902 --> 00:29:39,097
Yes, I'll just...
See this.

444
00:29:39,325 --> 00:29:41,095
Okay.

445
00:29:46,975 --> 00:29:48,616
What was that?

446
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,820
- What was that?
- That Sound!

447
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:53,924
Forget.

448
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:57,540
Holly! Arise! Something was here,
gotta see this!

449
00:29:57,541 --> 00:30:00,124
- Is jokingly Jenson?
- Holy shit!

450
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,601
- What the hell.
- Okay. Action

451
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:04,224
- Denise?
- Do not like it!

452
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:07,115
Denise, if something happened,
was last night.

453
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:08,538
Do not know.

454
00:30:08,547 --> 00:30:12,818
I do not see any danger, I know it
is strange and so I want to shoot.

455
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:14,853
Okay, whatever.

456
00:30:14,865 --> 00:30:16,886
Can you wait a minute?

457
00:30:18,228 --> 00:30:20,064
Thank you.

458
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:23,286
You idiot!

459
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:28,840
Okay,
woke up and found something strange:

460
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:33,383
footprints, located between these
two stones and around the tents,

461
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:36,621
format is strange,
see how big they are?

462
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:41,992
And the other... is greater...
Two pairs, two different people.

463
00:30:42,016 --> 00:30:44,838
- People?!
- I speak not of Yeti, Jenson!

464
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:47,341
Come on, look at the size
of these footprints!

465
00:30:47,342 --> 00:30:49,807
I do not know, a bear, a tiger
Snow!

466
00:30:49,823 --> 00:30:54,142
- What? Snow tiger?!
- The Snow Tiger is extinct Denise!

467
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:55,590
What is more strange:

468
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:59,171
Anyone walking in this type
Snow boots need special

469
00:30:59,172 --> 00:31:03,218
need to grip, then use
stakes or gloves well modeled,

470
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:07,094
but are footprints soft, and is
whatever, were bare.

471
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,327
Andy told us that low
night temperature here...

472
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:13,043
- Freeze the toes in 10 minutes.
- What explains the Yeti.

473
00:31:13,044 --> 00:31:16,440
- There's your fucking Yeti!
- How do you know? - The damned do not exist!

474
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,831
- Do not know!
- By God, Jenson!

475
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,432
Okay, filming.

476
00:31:20,447 --> 00:31:23,924
No footprints are inside
or outside of campgrounds,

477
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,395
is as if something fell from the sky,
walked barefoot around the stalls

478
00:31:28,411 --> 00:31:30,464
and then rise again.

479
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,356
- Yeti flies too?
- Hey, Mike. - Hey.

480
00:31:33,384 --> 00:31:34,587
Can we go?

481
00:31:34,615 --> 00:31:37,577
- Has snow tiger here?
- No damn tigers here.

482
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:39,280
Come.

483
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,953
Not have to cross it, right?

484
00:31:42,565 --> 00:31:43,915
No.

485
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:48,088
- are well? All morning quiet.
- Yeah, all right.

486
00:31:48,112 --> 00:31:51,520
- Do not look fine.
- So for us to fill.

487
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:53,732
They think I'm filling?

488
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,951
No, we think Bigfoot
was in camping last night.

489
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:58,804
How could it be fake?

490
00:31:58,813 --> 00:32:03,027
Okay, Holly, nobody ever did
Bigfoot footprints in the snow.

491
00:32:04,873 --> 00:32:06,925
He's right, Holly,

492
00:32:06,943 --> 00:32:09,952
fun is cool, but
look around you,

493
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,822
is the last place
to scare someone.

494
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,547
Do not know what they are talking about.

495
00:32:18,054 --> 00:32:22,265
Left So say we all
the limit this morning.

496
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:37,354
Holly!
Did you hear that?

497
00:32:39,511 --> 00:32:43,798
The entire team wonders
whence comes this strange sound,

498
00:32:43,824 --> 00:32:47,464
watched the tape and no one can tell where
is

499
00:32:47,488 --> 00:32:49,495
and then found this...

500
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:54,262
As in camping,
the trail has no beginning or end...

501
00:32:54,283 --> 00:32:55,843
're A little scared.

502
00:32:55,861 --> 00:32:59,024
Holly! Come here,
more footprints!

503
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:05,191
- What is it?
- A meteorological tower.

504
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:09,619
The footprints are all over the area here.
The collar measures the wind speed.

505
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:11,702
No more, probably.

506
00:33:18,382 --> 00:33:21,612
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Following the footprints.

507
00:33:21,637 --> 00:33:25,975
Whatever makes that sound,
is here, and want to know why.

508
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:30,659
- E?
- Wait.

509
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:32,819
What the...

510
00:33:36,243 --> 00:33:38,236
- You okay?
- Okay?

511
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,361
-
Yes - Are you sure?

512
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,242
Holly...

513
00:33:44,265 --> 00:33:46,270
A language?

514
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:50,119
- It's not safe, Holly!
- Yes, that's what I saw.

515
00:33:50,135 --> 00:33:53,200
Seriously, it's a language!
We must go now!

516
00:33:53,221 --> 00:33:55,694
- Denise, can only...
- And the footprints?

517
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:59,026
- Jenson said it comes from there, listen!
- Voyage of Jenson. Give me a minute?

518
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:00,385
Hey, come on.

519
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:03,829
Is filling the bag with this stupid movie
.

520
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,321
Okay?

521
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:10,295
Is everything okay?

522
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:13,163
Yes, just scared,
is everything.

523
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,530
But you know, everyone is.

524
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:18,901
I heard about these steps
mountain in China

525
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:26,400
where birds fly against walls and
people and animals go crazy and die

526
00:34:26,428 --> 00:34:31,204
and all because the wind generates a sound
4 Mega Hertz

527
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,061
that makes people get mad.

528
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:36,524
- I think that...
- Wind crazy?

529
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,638
Jenson, all saw the tape and
hear whatever it is.

530
00:34:41,744 --> 00:34:44,010
Please tell me what is?

531
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,702
I heard this before.

532
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,924
Jesus Jenson.

533
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:54,225
This mountain is really "fantastic".

534
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:58,776
I stopped someone
mention how much I hate these rackets?

535
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,681
Someone?
No?

536
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:14,135
- Guys, wait!
- Come on slug.

537
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:18,132
Guys, wait, is here we come!

538
00:35:20,223 --> 00:35:23,295
- Thank God!
- Are you sure?

539
00:35:23,316 --> 00:35:28,628
I saw the pictures hundreds of times,
this is, was what happened here,

540
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,728
this is Step Dyatlov.

541
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:41,476
53 years ago today that nine people armed
camping in the same soil,

542
00:35:41,492 --> 00:35:44,432
they had dinner and went to bed

543
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:49,434
and somewhere between 9 and 11
the night, something that Russian officials

544
00:35:49,435 --> 00:35:53,020
defined as "uncontrollable force unknown"

545
00:35:53,036 --> 00:35:56,733
caused the flight of nine of its
tents in such a state of terror

546
00:35:56,747 --> 00:35:59,748
they tore the inside
and threw the night,

547
00:35:59,768 --> 00:36:02,450
to 17 degrees below zero.

548
00:36:02,477 --> 00:36:05,926
Gonna love this, Andy.
TV socket.

549
00:36:05,948 --> 00:36:07,868
It?
Which one?

550
00:36:07,884 --> 00:36:09,722
A gay.

551
00:36:09,741 --> 00:36:12,408
- It was good.
- Gracinha, Jenson.

552
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:19,633
Rustem Slobodin, 23,

553
00:36:19,634 --> 00:36:21,665
the first to be found.

554
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,191
Igor Dyatlov, 23,

555
00:36:24,218 --> 00:36:27,317
scout leader and most
experienced of the group,

556
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,296
probably was his idea to try
to go back to barracks.

557
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:33,004
Kolmogorova Zinaida, 22

558
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:35,941
just a year older than I am now

559
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:38,504
was the nearest camping
when the force arrived,

560
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:41,426
and only victim that showed signal strength
,

561
00:36:41,441 --> 00:36:45,372
was no language and a large portion of your
oral cavity.

562
00:36:46,027 --> 00:36:48,998
Dubinina Ludmila, 21,

563
00:36:49,138 --> 00:36:51,809
Nicolai Thibeaux-Brignolles,

564
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:54,709
Alexandrovich Zolotarev,

565
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:57,616
Alexander Kolevatov.

566
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:04,425
The cause of death for all victims
was defined as hypothermia,

567
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:08,834
But Rustem and Nicolai also
had serious skull fractures,

568
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:13,540
and Ludmila and Zolotarev
Alexandrovich also had broken ribs,

569
00:37:14,419 --> 00:37:17,551
but no bodies tried to defend injuries

570
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,411
on the other hand does not have
external injuries...

571
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:24,455
Somehow, something tried
crush the skull of two men

572
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,727
and broke ribs and Ludmila Alexandrovich

573
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:30,570
without leaving anything more than bruises.

574
00:37:31,484 --> 00:37:36,459
Moreover, Alexandrovich was positive for
high concentration of radiation.

575
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:39,370
Hello!

576
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:45,926
Where here
contracted Alexandrovich much radiation?

577
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:48,034
And because he alone?

578
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:51,426
Georgiy Krivonischenko, 24,

579
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,358
Yuri Doroshenko, 21,

580
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:58,101
when others fled,

581
00:37:58,129 --> 00:38:00,931
they sat quietly near the rest of the fire

582
00:38:00,941 --> 00:38:03,653
Quietly and froze to death.

583
00:38:12,352 --> 00:38:15,018
- What is it, Andy?
- Nothing.

584
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:17,390
Not sound like anything.

585
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:20,945
The GPS seems primed,
should not be at this point.

586
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:23,100
Seems suspect.

587
00:38:23,707 --> 00:38:26,562
Think this is my fault too?

588
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:28,884
- I dunno, it ruined?
- Not!

589
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:32,753
She must have moved at my watch
Also, the altimeter burned,

590
00:38:32,772 --> 00:38:34,489
it and see,

591
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:39,684
compass went crazy, went pro Himalayas with
and it always worked, but here.

592
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:43,623
I think we should leave.

593
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:47,613
- What? Just arrived!
- But we have to go back...

594
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:50,460
're Blind without GPS or reliable map.

595
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:55,854
- What's wrong with the map?
- There should already be here.

596
00:38:55,887 --> 00:38:57,700
How so?

597
00:38:57,715 --> 00:39:03,362
According map covered 23 kms today
not arrive before midnight.

598
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,483
So what?
We are fast.

599
00:39:05,484 --> 00:39:08,807
Look, let's go and follow
compass to stop freaking out

600
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:12,968
is obvious that some of the magnetic field
rocks and such

601
00:39:12,995 --> 00:39:15,760
stop elsewhere that no one
would notice the difference.

602
00:39:15,776 --> 00:39:19,311
- I have to finish the images before.
- Forget about the footage, Holly!

603
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:21,539
Obvious that something
is wrong, we should go,

604
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,417
begin to put it all together, gives
time.

605
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:26,019
No, no, no, do not want to get
,

606
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:31,380
but if we start together and we will be
walking in the dark and that's not good.

607
00:39:31,397 --> 00:39:33,174
Guys, it's a night

608
00:39:33,175 --> 00:39:37,779
people live for thousands of years
without clocks and without GPS

609
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:40,808
I think we got one night,

610
00:39:40,823 --> 00:39:42,914
what was to come.

611
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:46,534
Okay, let's have dinner.

612
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:48,388
Thank you.

613
00:39:58,669 --> 00:40:00,406
Hey.

614
00:40:00,423 --> 00:40:02,101
's Going on a date there.

615
00:40:02,102 --> 00:40:04,272
Strange, I feel that I am
sailing.

616
00:40:04,273 --> 00:40:06,888
Just do not understand what she sees
a guy like him.

617
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:08,328
- It's so arrogant...
- Confident...

618
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,062
- Full of himself... - Arrogant...
- Asshole...

619
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:14,109
You know, there's a room that
tent, you come in?

620
00:40:14,135 --> 00:40:17,167
Oh, maybe you too,
I'm sure I will someday

621
00:40:17,183 --> 00:40:20,739
boyfriend as cool as Andy, so...

622
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,180
What are you doing?

623
00:40:22,192 --> 00:40:23,688
Nothing, just...

624
00:40:24,778 --> 00:40:26,390
Shit!

625
00:40:28,148 --> 00:40:30,347
Thank you, thank you.

626
00:40:30,348 --> 00:40:33,030
It is one of the reasons why
can not find anyone.

627
00:40:33,047 --> 00:40:35,594
Not find anyone,
so I'm going with you.

628
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:37,428
In their desires.

629
00:40:40,865 --> 00:40:46,385
You know what Andy said...
About the magnetic field of the rocks?

630
00:40:46,386 --> 00:40:48,401
Yes?

631
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:50,488
And if not that?

632
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:55,093
Okay,

633
00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:57,966
tell us what you have there.

634
00:40:57,984 --> 00:41:01,292
So, this is a pretty basic Geiger counter
,

635
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:05,381
without complicating,
it detects radiation levels.

636
00:41:10,994 --> 00:41:12,945
Like here,

637
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:16,163
definitely no radiation in this area.

638
00:41:16,872 --> 00:41:20,297
Uranium could be rocks here?

639
00:41:22,711 --> 00:41:26,838
There is nothing dangerous, but
is more than you should.

640
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:31,285
Yes, the source of it...

641
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,427
Surely comes from there.

642
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:35,382
Let's check.

643
00:41:43,882 --> 00:41:46,538
- In this direction.
- Beware!

644
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:50,326
Lucile not like it.

645
00:41:50,352 --> 00:41:52,628
I think I found something.

646
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,003
Hey, Jenson.

647
00:41:56,536 --> 00:41:58,937
See that thin ice there?

648
00:41:58,964 --> 00:42:01,115
-
Yes - Snow...

649
00:42:01,124 --> 00:42:03,107
Yes?
What is?

650
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:05,794
Looks like someone was here,

651
00:42:05,821 --> 00:42:08,886
type in recent days...

652
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:10,773
Be careful!

653
00:42:10,796 --> 00:42:12,617
Okay.

654
00:42:12,635 --> 00:42:14,805
Here well up here.

655
00:42:22,488 --> 00:42:24,971
- Holly, beware!
- Okay.

656
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:27,254
Wait.

657
00:42:29,354 --> 00:42:31,470
Jenson, I think it's a rock.

658
00:42:36,534 --> 00:42:39,786
- Shit! you're Getting this?
- To picking, I'm picking up.

659
00:42:42,421 --> 00:42:44,427
Be careful!

660
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:48,637
- See that?
- Yes

661
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,536
Continue, continue.

662
00:42:50,557 --> 00:42:52,353
Come on!

663
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,839
- What is it?
- I do not know.

664
00:42:57,863 --> 00:43:00,291
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Jenson!

665
00:43:00,306 --> 00:43:01,684
See that?

666
00:43:01,695 --> 00:43:03,137
Tell the camera what you see!

667
00:43:03,154 --> 00:43:04,534
What do you see? Let
.

668
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:07,390
A cave or something...

669
00:43:07,411 --> 00:43:10,880
God, Jenson...
lower the camera and come help me.

670
00:43:11,913 --> 00:43:14,251
- It's a door!
- What?

671
00:43:15,344 --> 00:43:17,103
Lower the camera.

672
00:43:17,122 --> 00:43:19,177
We have to film this!

673
00:43:20,546 --> 00:43:22,570
's So weird!

674
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:25,186
Of course it is, Jenson, see!

675
00:43:25,826 --> 00:43:28,278
Is a door in the middle of the mountains
!

676
00:43:28,302 --> 00:43:31,302
What are locked from the other side?

677
00:43:33,481 --> 00:43:36,487
Is designed to keep something inside.

678
00:43:37,912 --> 00:43:40,209
- Yes, but what?
- Holly!

679
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:41,829
Look around, come on!

680
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:46,133
The Russian government took a long time
building a big solid door

681
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:48,616
to store something in the
mountain, we must not...

682
00:43:48,632 --> 00:43:51,067
Jenson, and why is she here?

683
00:43:51,085 --> 00:43:57,208
Do not want to know? The unstoppable force
unknown? Yeti or alien or...

684
00:43:57,226 --> 00:44:00,274
One superman designed by the Soviets?

685
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:04,003
I want to know what is
and the answer is behind the door,

686
00:44:04,004 --> 00:44:07,276
Then could help me, please?

687
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,476
Okay?

688
00:44:17,557 --> 00:44:19,220
Expected.

689
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:29,146
Is now open,

690
00:44:29,165 --> 00:44:31,685
but is frozen, it seems.

691
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:36,692
Well, it means that we can open up
derretermos ice.

692
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:40,553
- Let's call them and get hot water.
- No, Jesus...

693
00:44:41,406 --> 00:44:44,071
- Why not...
- Why?

694
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:48,782
You want to go here...
This will only scare them more...

695
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:52,092
And do not want to change
the camping, okay? So...

696
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:53,680
Count tomorrow

697
00:44:53,695 --> 00:44:56,919
now and then we come back, okay?

698
00:45:14,806 --> 00:45:16,717
Hey, guys!
What's up?

699
00:45:16,718 --> 00:45:19,034
- Let's go to bed?
- Sure.

700
00:45:19,775 --> 00:45:21,526
Good night.

701
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:24,890
- Goodnight, Holly.
- Good evening.

702
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:26,756
Good night, guys.

703
00:45:28,915 --> 00:45:30,947
What are you reading?

704
00:45:33,351 --> 00:45:35,354
Slaughterhouse 5.

705
00:45:35,972 --> 00:45:38,492
- Do not like Vonnegut?
- I love this book.

706
00:45:38,507 --> 00:45:41,177
- I thought of him yesterday.
- Good.

707
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,229
I'm impressed!

708
00:45:43,592 --> 00:45:46,165
- Sit, teacher.
- Thank you.

709
00:45:46,924 --> 00:45:48,957
Just take it from here...

710
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:00,219
Yes, impossible to heat

711
00:46:01,146 --> 00:46:04,258
when sitting in snow all the time.

712
00:46:04,288 --> 00:46:07,672
I think my ass will not know when
crap.

713
00:46:09,775 --> 00:46:13,485
- They found something with the Geiger counter?
- Not totally clean.

714
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:15,063
Good,

715
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:19,298
I think, I mean,
hope you find something to your movie.

716
00:46:19,314 --> 00:46:21,320
Still have time?

717
00:46:25,576 --> 00:46:27,483
Love young.

718
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,006
Hope you're right that...

719
00:46:32,035 --> 00:46:36,075
Thatcher is a nice guy, but not
concerning boyfriend.

720
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:39,211
What?
I think he's cute.

721
00:46:40,163 --> 00:46:43,307
Speaks master to stay on track.

722
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,283
Staying on track?

723
00:46:45,316 --> 00:46:48,095
Yes, let me see, man,

724
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,220
Stay in camping,
a track in the middle of nowhere

725
00:46:52,246 --> 00:46:56,559
especially when it's cold
and the girl needs caress.

726
00:46:56,582 --> 00:46:59,123
A romantic, my God!

727
00:46:59,137 --> 00:47:01,782
- Not the worst.
- He has herpes?

728
00:47:03,383 --> 00:47:05,460
This is not, not.

729
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,883
Know the camera on the phone?

730
00:47:07,905 --> 00:47:10,304
Oh, no!
It records?

731
00:47:10,324 --> 00:47:14,469
Not only is the map panorama reliable,
is also the head by the camera.

732
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:16,340
No, Denise.

733
00:47:16,363 --> 00:47:18,252
She will fall.

734
00:47:19,678 --> 00:47:22,152
And you, what is your tactic?

735
00:47:25,417 --> 00:47:28,185
Te present to my only friend

736
00:47:28,203 --> 00:47:30,029
"Colonel Whisky".

737
00:47:30,053 --> 00:47:32,717
- Hello, sir.
- Yes, please.

738
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:35,048
John Patrick Hauser,

739
00:47:35,072 --> 00:47:37,698
're trying to get me drunk?

740
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,851
Is the easiest way to get
paradoxical undressing.

741
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:45,402
Cool.

742
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:53,580
- Can you believe that?
- Not power, it's just a flirt on track.

743
00:47:53,596 --> 00:47:56,843
- Just a flirt on track?
- 'Re Filming, Hauser said.

744
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:01,329
I'm not sure...
This sequence wet.

745
00:48:02,116 --> 00:48:05,320
Lucile Whenever we call, right?

746
00:48:05,347 --> 00:48:07,641
Hey man, you laugh but...

747
00:48:07,674 --> 00:48:11,524
If shoot this illegal in the
state of Oregon, then...

748
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,514
I would not, but unfortunately there is
,

749
00:48:14,537 --> 00:48:17,786
so I have to maintain a
professional relationship she

750
00:48:17,806 --> 00:48:19,822
mostly.

751
00:48:33,692 --> 00:48:36,588
Well, I'm going...

752
00:48:37,642 --> 00:48:39,716
- I'll sleep.
- Okay.

753
00:48:42,882 --> 00:48:44,796
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

754
00:48:44,806 --> 00:48:46,509
Sweet dreams.

755
00:48:54,095 --> 00:48:57,507
Sorry for accusing him of faking
footprints.

756
00:48:57,531 --> 00:49:02,438
Okay. Do not know if it was fake, then
thought the same thing.

757
00:49:02,457 --> 00:49:05,528
I jumped into a conclusion unwarranted.

758
00:49:05,553 --> 00:49:09,268
Hoped that hit me,
but you good people.

759
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:14,036
Well, if you want to apologize...

760
00:49:14,055 --> 00:49:18,170
Such warm me with a caress?

761
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:21,649
- Really?
- Yes

762
00:49:23,185 --> 00:49:24,839
Yes

763
00:49:28,526 --> 00:49:31,364

764
00:49:31,365 --> 00:49:33,944
guess is...
The third day

765
00:49:35,508 --> 00:49:38,634
and we know Denise.

766
00:49:55,275 --> 00:49:58,315
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

767
00:49:58,337 --> 00:50:01,577
- Our own movie.
- Ready again?

768
00:50:01,592 --> 00:50:03,508
Why are you so surprised?

769
00:50:03,524 --> 00:50:05,827
Surprised me,
with the explosion.

770
00:50:05,848 --> 00:50:08,236
Explosion?

771
00:50:10,193 --> 00:50:11,415
Turn it off!

772
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:13,659
- What?
- Turn! Off! No!

773
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,045
'll Say I never did
sex at the camera?

774
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:19,024
- Andy!
- Oh, wait, that's part of the show.

775
00:50:19,025 --> 00:50:20,627
I have to admit it?

776
00:50:20,628 --> 00:50:22,618
- You'll have to admit...
- Andy!

777
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,928
Shit!

778
00:50:33,945 --> 00:50:36,050
What is this?

779
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,513
- What is it?
- Hear that? - Yes!

780
00:50:39,851 --> 00:50:41,394
Guys?

781
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,876
Everyone okay?

782
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,793
What is this?

783
00:50:46,699 --> 00:50:48,195
What the hell is that?

784
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,907
Shit!

785
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:52,699
- Denise! My God, out soon!
- Guys!

786
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,334
Denise, get up!

787
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,836
Avalanche!

788
00:50:58,165 --> 00:50:59,796
Come on, quick.

789
00:51:00,312 --> 00:51:02,592

790
00:51:04,118 --> 00:51:05,638

794
00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:25,216

795
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:39,129
Oh my God!
Where's Denise?

796
00:51:39,454 --> 00:51:40,981
Oh my God!

797
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:47,106
- Denise!
- Denise! Denise!

798
00:51:48,327 --> 00:51:50,274
She's gone!

799
00:51:50,296 --> 00:51:51,967
Denise died.

800
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:55,272
No way, man,
is waiting somewhere!

801
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:57,211
She's gone!

802
00:51:57,231 --> 00:51:59,417
- I'm sorry.
- She died.

803
00:52:07,495 --> 00:52:09,547
You abandoned her!

804
00:52:10,225 --> 00:52:12,793
- Abandoned her!
- Fuck you!

805
00:52:15,297 --> 00:52:18,912

808
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:28,353
Wake up, man! They tried to kill us and
bury, and think it was an accident?

809
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:31,417
You crazy bastard,

810
00:52:31,424 --> 00:52:34,093
're Talking not seen these explosions?

811
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:37,360
Choose? Or
explosions were the ghosts of the mountain?

812
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,331
- Do not know what happened!
- What!

813
00:52:39,332 --> 00:52:41,627
Anyone discovers this,
look around!

814
00:52:41,643 --> 00:52:46,353
I asked permission for the trip,
then know our itinerary,

815
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:49,845

Okay, so tell me, who is it?

820
00:52:57,995 --> 00:52:59,933

can not believe Denise died, but true

824
00:53:09,975 --> 00:53:14,528
Now we have to pull ourselves together,
and focus on not losing anyone else.

825
00:53:14,546 --> 00:53:18,400
- Andy, what do we do?
- My first aid kit.

826
00:53:23,727 --> 00:53:26,179
Okay, now what?

827
00:53:26,205 --> 00:53:28,615

828
00:53:28,637 --> 00:53:30,948
Okay, Jenson, get the camera.

Wait, try to be gentle!

833
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:49,435
Shit!
Shit, okay.

834
00:53:49,456 --> 00:53:52,067

840
00:54:09,427 --> 00:54:13,416
- I can not, JP!
- It's okay. Leave it to me.

841
00:54:13,975 --> 00:54:16,627
Not bad as she said, is only...

842
00:54:16,643 --> 00:54:19,984
Jenson, take a twig or
something to use as a splint.

843
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,839
- No, no, no!
- Not so bad, it'll be fine.

844
00:54:22,869 --> 00:54:27,192
'll Be fine, I promise I will...

845
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,763
This will hurt a bit
will hurt a bit, okay?

846
00:54:30,778 --> 00:54:34,120
Have to replace it...
Have to replace it now!

847
00:54:34,928 --> 00:54:36,330
- Ready?
- Yes

848
00:54:36,347 --> 00:54:38,141
count of three, okay?

849
00:54:38,162 --> 00:54:40,309
- Three breaths, okay?
- Yes

850
00:54:40,329 --> 00:54:42,436
- Are you ready?
- Make logo!

851
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:44,159
Okay, on three.

852
00:54:44,172 --> 00:54:45,440
Okay?
A...

853
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,668
It was not so bad.
It was not so bad.

854
00:54:49,683 --> 00:54:51,207
Not for you!

855
00:54:51,226 --> 00:54:54,152
- I'm sorry, it's over.
- Not! - Okay.

856
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:01,626
- Okay.
- This thing're on?

857
00:55:01,642 --> 00:55:04,104
Off,
do not want them to see me like this...

858
00:55:12,836 --> 00:55:15,244
This does not work!

859
00:55:15,262 --> 00:55:18,187
I paid for the international plan.

860
00:55:18,621 --> 00:55:22,344
This is stupid! We need help, we turn
flags.

861
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:25,209
- If we see who did it...
- Nobody... did it!

862
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:27,708
I do not know, JP, maybe
Jenson is right.

863
00:55:27,722 --> 00:55:29,732
No!

864
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:36,103
So Andy took the plunge and
bag is too far for someone to see us!

865
00:55:37,818 --> 00:55:39,859
Gotta same record?

866
00:55:39,891 --> 00:55:44,103
No matter the end of it, I
record what happens to us

867
00:55:44,118 --> 00:55:47,894
not done so as
Dyatlov another mystery.

868
00:55:49,306 --> 00:55:52,544
If we do that, we can ask for help before
?

869
00:55:52,571 --> 00:55:55,916
I do not think we can carry Andy.

870
00:55:55,929 --> 00:55:57,971
What is this?

871
00:55:57,985 --> 00:56:00,003
- What?
- That look...

872
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,786
What the hell is happening?

873
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:09,108
We found something with the Geiger counter.

874
00:56:12,461 --> 00:56:14,461
What do you think?

875
00:56:15,535 --> 00:56:17,548
A port.

876
00:56:18,314 --> 00:56:20,128
What?

877
00:56:20,144 --> 00:56:25,498
Freezing in the damn snow all day
and says he has a fucking bunker here?

878
00:56:25,531 --> 00:56:30,132
But we can not open,
radiation is... strong.

879
00:56:32,851 --> 00:56:34,858
How strong?

880
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,999
It is not dangerous, but...

881
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,815
Unbelievable!

882
00:56:47,095 --> 00:56:49,152
Planted footprints?

883
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:52,189
No!
Do not planted footprints.

884
00:56:52,379 --> 00:56:54,302
Not believe.

885
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:57,197
Great, not believe me.

886
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:06,397
Okay,

887
00:57:07,569 --> 00:57:11,289
if someone started this avalanche,
reason is there, right?

888
00:57:11,305 --> 00:57:12,611
Yes

889
00:57:12,627 --> 00:57:18,455
Light up the flags, so people will
will not have chance to kill us.

890
00:57:18,837 --> 00:57:20,842
Okay.

891
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:36,276
Come on!

892
00:57:41,187 --> 00:57:42,972
What?

893
00:57:44,452 --> 00:57:46,848
Orange lights in the sky.

894
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:53,689
JP, I'm sorry,

895
00:57:54,936 --> 00:57:56,946
should have told you

896
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,791
but they were so concerned
with the compass, and...

897
00:58:00,807 --> 00:58:02,826
With the map, and...

898
00:58:03,935 --> 00:58:07,076
And did not want anything to happen that
.

899
00:58:10,698 --> 00:58:12,510
Yes ..

900
00:58:12,516 --> 00:58:16,124
Follow step by step how
they killed nine people,

901
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:18,784
what you thought would happen?

902
00:58:18,801 --> 00:58:20,887
I do not know.

903
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,518
I just...

904
00:58:28,731 --> 00:58:33,022
Always felt attracted to this place

905
00:58:33,047 --> 00:58:36,943
do not know why,
can not explain.

906
00:58:39,051 --> 00:58:41,056
I do not want that.

907
00:58:43,143 --> 00:58:46,630
Do you think anyone will see the flags?

908
00:58:47,268 --> 00:58:49,037
I do not know.

909
00:58:49,952 --> 00:58:54,383
If to freeze here,
opened that door with radiation or not, ok?

910
00:58:54,385 --> 00:58:56,200
Yes

911
00:58:56,218 --> 00:58:58,047
Okay.

912
00:58:58,072 --> 00:59:02,079
Want blueberry pancakes
or Macaroni and Cheese?

913
00:59:02,107 --> 00:59:04,950
Have to eat blueberries for breakfast...

914
00:59:04,957 --> 00:59:06,818
To grow.

915
00:59:06,831 --> 00:59:08,344
Hey, Jenson!

916
00:59:08,362 --> 00:59:11,242
- What is it?
- Hey, man...

917
00:59:11,267 --> 00:59:13,793
Sorry for Denise

918
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:18,531
true, think what you want
, but sorry.

919
00:59:19,186 --> 00:59:21,192
Yes, me too.

920
00:59:22,783 --> 00:59:25,793
Oh, shit!
Someone is coming, look!

921
00:59:26,341 --> 00:59:27,936
Help!

922
00:59:27,956 --> 00:59:30,660
We need help!

923
00:59:31,512 --> 00:59:34,947
We saw the flags!
Are you well?

924
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:37,822
Our friend got hurt.

925
00:59:38,932 --> 00:59:41,258
- No, look, it's a lie.
- What?

926
00:59:41,279 --> 00:59:43,780
Are no backpacks,
as they arrived so fast?

927
00:59:43,795 --> 00:59:46,752
- Are following us.
- I said, detonated the explosives.

928
00:59:46,773 --> 00:59:48,249
- Who?
- The military!

929
00:59:48,266 --> 00:59:50,496
- Go, go, now!
- We will not leave you, Andy!

930
00:59:50,497 --> 00:59:52,495

00:59:52,496 --> 00:59:54,678
- Help load!
- I'll get it, we will.

932
00:59:54,702 --> 00:59:57,583
- I can not go anywhere!
- One, two, three.

933
00:59:57,602 --> 00:59:59,120
Okay!

934
00:59:59,136 --> 01:00:00,368
- I can not...
- Shit!

935
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:02,261
Can not go, can not, will!

936
01:00:02,262 --> 01:00:03,422
Go Now!

937
01:00:03,435 --> 01:00:05,419
- Jenson to the door!
- Come on.

938
01:00:05,434 --> 01:00:08,053
- JP, have to follow us, okay?
- Vai.

939
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:11,361
Hey, give me the gun signaling

940
01:00:13,171 --> 01:00:15,179
Quick!

941
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,714
We need to go now!

942
01:00:18,729 --> 01:00:19,799
- Come on!
- I will not!

943
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:22,354
- JP, come on!
- We have to go!

944
01:00:23,521 --> 01:00:25,523
We'll send help!

945
01:00:29,082 --> 01:00:30,622
Jesus, are shooting!

946
01:00:30,623 --> 01:00:31,732
What the...

947
01:00:34,462 --> 01:00:35,750
Holly!

948
01:00:35,766 --> 01:00:37,772
O Jesus!

949
01:00:38,581 --> 01:00:39,716
- Not!
- Go!

950
01:00:39,717 --> 01:00:40,610

JP, come on!

953
01:00:49,235 --> 01:00:50,600
Come on, Holly!

954
01:00:54,001 --> 01:00:55,480
Arise!

955
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:02,403
- Open the door.
- Shit! Shit! Shit!

956
01:01:02,898 --> 01:01:04,043
Opens!

957
01:01:04,054 --> 01:01:06,900
It is open only froze shut.

958
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:08,924
Guys!
Guys!

959
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:13,222
- Shit!
- Oh, shit!

960
01:01:13,245 --> 01:01:15,590
Opened enters!
Quick!

961
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:18,625
Come!

962
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:23,189
- Holly!
- Close the door, close the damn door

963
01:01:25,779 --> 01:01:27,154
Lock!

964
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:30,264
Bolt on the other side,
and they have closed!

965
01:01:30,275 --> 01:01:32,720
- My God locked us!
- JP?

966
01:01:32,738 --> 01:01:34,071
- Yes?
- You okay?

967
01:01:34,072 --> 01:01:35,848
No, I'm bleeding a lot.

968
01:01:35,865 --> 01:01:37,739
Press the injury.

969
01:01:38,645 --> 01:01:40,859
- It's okay.
- Stop for a second.

970
01:01:40,873 --> 01:01:43,685
Take the camera,
light on camera.

971
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,331
Good.

972
01:01:49,621 --> 01:01:51,149
Okay, got it!

973
01:01:52,284 --> 01:01:54,287
Oh, God!

974
01:01:54,307 --> 01:01:56,751
What do you see?

975
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,454
Is a tunnel!

976
01:01:59,478 --> 01:02:02,255
- What?
- We're in a tunnel.

977
01:02:09,068 --> 01:02:10,871
Okay.

978
01:02:17,363 --> 01:02:19,332
What do you see?

979
01:02:20,953 --> 01:02:23,903
An alternator...
Alternator power.

980
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,674
- League!
- Okay.

981
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:37,160
- Works.
- Thank God! - Right.

982
01:02:37,184 --> 01:02:39,525
- Should lock the door.
- Why?

983
01:02:39,526 --> 01:02:42,509
Why lock yourself out,
can come whenever you want.

984
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:45,183
No one will enter, face,
is wasted forces.

985
01:02:45,184 --> 01:02:47,702
- Is an emergency...
- Looked around?

986
01:02:47,703 --> 01:02:50,518
No one will come to save us.

987
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:52,996
We are on our own!

988
01:02:53,008 --> 01:02:56,289
They know that in a few
days we will dehydrate

989
01:02:56,303 --> 01:02:59,656
and not have to worry
with any of us.

990
01:03:00,478 --> 01:03:05,472
Then just lock themselves
the door and come back in a week.

991
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:07,959
Unless if we find an exit.

992
01:03:07,973 --> 01:03:10,499
- Can you walk?
- Yes

993
01:03:10,517 --> 01:03:13,414
- Okay.
- Beware, beware.

994
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:15,274
Shit!

995
01:03:16,618 --> 01:03:18,512
Okay.

996
01:03:19,423 --> 01:03:21,446
- Let's rectum.
- Okay.

997
01:03:22,912 --> 01:03:25,551
- Jenson, stay close.
- Okay.

998
01:03:25,564 --> 01:03:28,135
Slowly, slowly.

999
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Okay,
better take a break.

1000
01:03:45,415 --> 01:03:48,364
Shit, shit!
Another tunnel, another tunnel.

1001
01:03:49,378 --> 01:03:50,882
JP, JP...

1002
01:03:51,382 --> 01:03:52,889
What?
What is it?

1003
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,455
What?

1004
01:03:56,467 --> 01:03:58,021
I felt something.

1005
01:03:58,043 --> 01:03:59,672
What?

1006
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,998
There's something here!

1007
01:04:02,016 --> 01:04:04,576
- Follow.
- There's something here, Jenson, I swear!

1008
01:04:04,577 --> 01:04:06,379
There's nobody here, Holly!

1009
01:04:06,395 --> 01:04:08,228
Come on!

1010
01:04:10,189 --> 01:04:11,695
Shit!

1011
01:04:11,718 --> 01:04:14,377
- Which way?
- Left.

1012
01:04:14,388 --> 01:04:17,601
- Take it easy. Do not stop, do not stop.
- Right.

1013
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:20,913
The lights are still here.

1014
01:04:20,937 --> 01:04:23,646
- Stay close.
- Okay.

1015
01:04:23,661 --> 01:04:25,202
Shit.

1016
01:04:25,215 --> 01:04:27,668
- Not very fast.
- Right.

1017
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:40,019
Jesus!

1018
01:04:42,594 --> 01:04:44,250
What is this place?

1019
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,853
Is a...

1020
01:04:45,868 --> 01:04:47,901
Laboratory or type.

1021
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:50,660
Still is.

1022
01:04:50,674 --> 01:04:52,703
What happened here?

1023
01:04:52,716 --> 01:04:54,714
Who will know?

1024
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:57,246
Sit down, let me see.

1025
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,245
Wait...

1026
01:04:59,258 --> 01:05:01,029
Here.

1027
01:05:01,045 --> 01:05:02,913
Use this.

1028
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,600
I'll Be fine.

1029
01:05:10,783 --> 01:05:12,424
Sorry.

1030
01:05:16,091 --> 01:05:18,177
It will hurt a bit.

1031
01:05:29,734 --> 01:05:31,748
I found an opening.

1032
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:35,393
- Be careful.
- Yes, no problem.

1033
01:05:41,368 --> 01:05:43,376
Look at this place.

1034
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:55,520
Holly, come here, look at this
.

1035
01:05:57,636 --> 01:06:01,071
- What is this!
- A thick book, I think.

1036
01:06:03,935 --> 01:06:05,693
I know that word.

1037
01:06:05,709 --> 01:06:07,843
- Yes?
- Yes ..

1038
01:06:07,857 --> 01:06:10,664
Saw her several times while researching.

1039
01:06:10,665 --> 01:06:12,675
What is the meaning?

1040
01:06:13,483 --> 01:06:15,665
Killed in combat.

1041
01:06:15,689 --> 01:06:17,720
This all?

1042
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:19,810
Can you read something else?

1043
01:06:19,828 --> 01:06:21,845
Only dates.

1044
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:23,887
1945.

1045
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:27,278
1959.

1046
01:06:27,511 --> 01:06:30,727
Year in which the explorers were killed
,

1047
01:06:30,746 --> 01:06:32,783
and then.

1048
01:06:37,467 --> 01:06:39,975
What?
Is a boat.

1049
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:42,435
Is the Eldridge

1050
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:45,920
USS Eldridge,
the Philadelphia Experiment.

1051
01:06:45,939 --> 01:06:48,185
Philadelphia Experiment?

1052
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come on, live in the cave and such?
In 1943
the U.S. Government made a
experiment with this ship.

1053
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What kind of experiment?
Teleportation.

1054
01:07:03,383 --> 01:07:05,262
Oh my God!

1055
01:07:05,276 --> 01:07:09,039
There are rumors of people
saw the carcass of the ship,

1056
01:07:09,057 --> 01:07:11,808
but no one has ever seen
anything like this,

1057
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:15,166
type these photos are top-top-secret...

1058
01:07:15,935 --> 01:07:18,368
Someone could be killed because of it.

1059
01:07:18,385 --> 01:07:20,335
Oh God!

1060
01:07:20,355 --> 01:07:22,146
Okay.

1061
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:24,071
Let's get out.

1062
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,970
- Yes
- JP, can walk?

1063
01:07:26,991 --> 01:07:29,223
- No.
- Shit.

1064
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:32,957
I'm not leaving here, okay?
So think of something.

1065
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:35,026
Find a way out, okay?

1066
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:41,095
Okay, and then I'll go back and
carry you out, okay?

1067
01:07:41,453 --> 01:07:43,457
Come on!

1068
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1069
01:08:06,891 --> 01:08:08,938
Jesus Christ!

1070
01:08:30,409 --> 01:08:33,848
Is a cave formed naturally...

1071
01:08:33,865 --> 01:08:37,975
Do not know if the output is
seems a little wild.

1072
01:08:37,977 --> 01:08:40,099
Turned espeleólogo now?

1073
01:08:40,115 --> 01:08:42,123
See it.

1074
01:08:42,142 --> 01:08:46,556
Seems nuclear power for electricity
it has here.

1075
01:08:46,575 --> 01:08:50,723
Alexandrovich was here, which was picked
radiation.

1076
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:53,983
You have to have an outlet.

1077
01:08:57,127 --> 01:08:59,152
Caution!

1078
01:09:02,493 --> 01:09:04,499
Oh, my God!

1079
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:13,633
What is it?

1080
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,505
- Still works.
- Yes, give me that.

1081
01:09:29,037 --> 01:09:31,893
I knew someone had been here.

1082
01:09:31,924 --> 01:09:33,785
Who is he?

1083
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,645
A military.

1084
01:09:36,985 --> 01:09:39,279
Why is he here?

1085
01:09:42,233 --> 01:09:48,361
When killing five Americans want
to keep a secret buried for 50 years

1086
01:09:48,374 --> 01:09:52,913
send someone to make sure
that the secret will be kept.

1087
01:09:56,773 --> 01:09:59,192
- What are you doing?
- Checking something.

1088
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,018
Shit!

1089
01:10:02,192 --> 01:10:05,652
A we found at
Meteorological Tower.

1090
01:10:05,673 --> 01:10:08,174
Is his tongue?

1091
01:10:10,404 --> 01:10:12,581
How did she get there?

1092
01:10:12,593 --> 01:10:14,613
Something must have started.

1093
01:10:14,629 --> 01:10:16,816
So the door unlocked.

1094
01:10:16,817 --> 01:10:20,982
Could be doing an experiment there?

1095
01:10:20,998 --> 01:10:23,728
He ​​said he has a lot of it in progress.

1096
01:10:23,729 --> 01:10:25,487
My God!

1097
01:10:25,502 --> 01:10:28,159
Holly,
looks at the bullet holes,

1098
01:10:28,175 --> 01:10:30,183
this is not a laboratory,

1099
01:10:30,202 --> 01:10:32,319
is an execution chamber.

1100
01:10:32,335 --> 01:10:34,368
Oh God!

1101
01:10:35,345 --> 01:10:37,857
Holly, what is this?

1102
01:10:46,722 --> 01:10:49,103
Seems one of the soldiers that book.

1103
01:10:58,747 --> 01:11:00,920
I do not understand.

1104
01:11:00,937 --> 01:11:03,661
- Jenson!
- These things do not...

1105
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,542
Not appear normal.

1106
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:08,935
Maybe that's why we left here.

1107
01:11:15,274 --> 01:11:17,305
What the hell is that?

1108
01:11:25,592 --> 01:11:27,592
Wait!

1109
01:11:27,613 --> 01:11:29,647
This door was not open.

1110
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:31,676
What is it?

1111
01:11:38,637 --> 01:11:40,654
Be careful!

1112
01:11:45,733 --> 01:11:47,483
What is this?

1113
01:11:47,498 --> 01:11:49,234
JP?

1114
01:11:50,203 --> 01:11:51,916
God!

1115
01:11:57,673 --> 01:11:59,677
There's something here, Jenson.

1116
01:12:05,212 --> 01:12:07,423
- Oh, no!
- My God!

1117
01:12:12,872 --> 01:12:16,873
-It's Blood?
- We gotta get out of here, okay?

1118
01:12:20,296 --> 01:12:22,429
- What is it?
- I do not know.

1119
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:25,111
- A type of light?
- No lower.

1120
01:12:25,128 --> 01:12:27,144
Let me see that.

1121
01:12:28,192 --> 01:12:32,797
Is this the same camera, and still
battery. See what's on it.

1122
01:12:32,845 --> 01:12:35,855
<i>- No recordings!
- Yeah, tell that to the camera</i>

1123
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:39,593
<i>- Go away, please!
- The Cold War is over, we're friends.</i>

1124
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:43,450
- I do not...
- Accelerate before the battery runs out.

1125
01:12:43,478 --> 01:12:45,116
<i>He died.</i>

1126
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:52,012
Stop!

1127
01:12:52,044 --> 01:12:53,991
<i>See what's on it.</i>

1128
01:12:54,019 --> 01:12:57,102
<i>- No recordings!
- Yeah, tell that to the cam...</i>

1129
01:12:57,574 --> 01:12:59,605
Shit!

1130
01:13:03,013 --> 01:13:05,026
This is impossible!

1131
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:06,929
No, maybe not...

1132
01:13:06,951 --> 01:13:10,831
Remembers Eldridge,
the Philadelphia Experiment?

1133
01:13:10,832 --> 01:13:15,313
He ​​allegedly was teleported
from Philadelphia to Norfolk.

1134
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:17,396
- So what?
- So what...

1135
01:13:17,411 --> 01:13:22,483
Reportedly arrived in Norfolk
10minutes before leaving Philadelphia.

1136
01:13:23,141 --> 01:13:25,660
I mean that is a
damn time machine?

1137
01:13:25,674 --> 01:13:30,384
No, I mean anyone,
elite scientists or the government,

1138
01:13:30,385 --> 01:13:32,824
none knows

1139
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:37,445
Nobody knows what is happening or has
notion of how fuck is this.

1140
01:13:37,462 --> 01:13:41,488
Holly, all these experiments were abandoned
,

1141
01:13:41,501 --> 01:13:47,303
Eldridge's crew, who not
fused to the deck, went crazy,

1142
01:13:47,321 --> 01:13:50,894
suffered some...
Change...

1143
01:13:50,912 --> 01:13:53,299
Mutations...

1144
01:13:53,314 --> 01:13:56,244
People do not mention these things.

1145
01:13:57,074 --> 01:13:58,936
JP!

1146
01:14:01,355 --> 01:14:03,357
Jenson, come on!

1147
01:14:03,597 --> 01:14:05,404
Come on!

1148
01:14:09,686 --> 01:14:11,487
JP!

1149
01:14:24,323 --> 01:14:26,121
Jenson!

1150
01:14:31,902 --> 01:14:33,700
Jenson!

1151
01:14:36,133 --> 01:14:38,508
What are you doing?
Get out there.

1152
01:15:08,478 --> 01:15:11,801
- Where were they?
- Go back to get me.

1153
01:15:11,815 --> 01:15:14,456
Control yourself,
recompose now!

1154
01:15:32,836 --> 01:15:35,341
- JP!
- Come!

1155
01:15:37,698 --> 01:15:39,765
On the ceiling, the ceiling!

1156
01:15:39,783 --> 01:15:41,550
Jenson!

1157
01:15:41,551 --> 01:15:43,598
- Jesus Christ!
- Jenson!

1158
01:15:46,315 --> 01:15:48,594
- From where?
- I do not know.

1159
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,824
Look, it's up there!

1160
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:55,172
- Jenson, where he was?
- I do not know!

1161
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,828
- Where was he?
- Catch the JP!

1162
01:16:03,247 --> 01:16:04,770
Jenson!

1163
01:16:08,169 --> 01:16:11,361
Let him out the door and ran after
, understood?

1164
01:16:11,376 --> 01:16:12,949
Understood!

1165
01:16:15,554 --> 01:16:18,544
- Run! - Beware!
- Go, go!

1166
01:16:18,978 --> 01:16:20,617
- Over here!
- Come on!

1167
01:16:20,953 --> 01:16:22,696
Run!
Go!

1168
01:16:22,967 --> 01:16:25,048
Jenson, here!

1169
01:16:52,894 --> 01:16:55,989
Because let us run?
Why not prevented?

1170
01:16:56,014 --> 01:17:01,345
I do not know, we should be dead.
Do not kill us when they had a chance!

1171
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the hell is that?
Like a giant fossil.

1172
01:17:29,258 --> 01:17:32,791
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for us.

1173
01:17:33,747 --> 01:17:37,915
- JP! I said I would come back for him.
- It can not see what they did with it!

1174
01:17:37,923 --> 01:17:41,001
If we open the door, do the same with us
,

1175
01:17:41,016 --> 01:17:46,632
're trapped, and they know,
're exactly where they wanted.

1176
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Holly saw that?
- Yes

1177
01:17:55,399 --> 01:17:57,425
Do it again.

1178
01:18:06,377 --> 01:18:08,834
- She recorded this, right?
- Yes

1179
01:18:08,848 --> 01:18:10,573
Good.

1180
01:18:11,544 --> 01:18:13,940
I knew, I knew...

1181
01:18:14,748 --> 01:18:17,471
What!
- Teleportation.

1182
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Those creatures,
the way disappeared...
Were intangible,
can teleport

1183
01:18:27,061 --> 01:18:29,900
but not through these doors.

1184
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:33,232
Therefore lock from the outside.

1185
01:18:33,734 --> 01:18:38,131
There must be a connection between
those things and this place.

1186
01:18:48,588 --> 01:18:50,591
They came here,

1187
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,606
they came of it.

1188
01:18:52,619 --> 01:18:54,488
Makes sense...

1189
01:18:54,502 --> 01:18:56,435
Type this is...

1190
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:58,054
A giant...

1191
01:18:58,071 --> 01:19:00,154
"Wormhole"

1192
01:19:00,163 --> 01:19:01,919
type one...

1193
01:19:01,935 --> 01:19:03,785
Carrier.

1194
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- How to get here?
- I do not know.

1195
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Holly
the Mansi, the natives, all
here for thousands of years,
Do not know how this thing works, but
is what they are trying to say.

1196
01:19:27,683 --> 01:19:30,306
So they built a teleporter?

1197
01:19:30,322 --> 01:19:35,529
I do not know, maybe just found this thing
the cave and drew,

1198
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:39,062
it may be some kind of alien technology
,

1199
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,519
maybe try to turn into a weapon.

1200
01:19:41,535 --> 01:19:45,668
And if there are more portals
like this in the world?

1201
01:19:45,684 --> 01:19:47,898
If these things come from within it...

1202
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:50,804
Explain all kinds of unsolved mysteries,

1203
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:54,733
the Eldridge, the appearances of
the Mothman in Point Pleasant,

1204
01:19:54,753 --> 01:19:56,812
'll know what else!

1205
01:20:00,214 --> 01:20:03,447
- The flashlight was already.
- Shit.

1206
01:20:03,471 --> 01:20:06,514
- Jenson, I see nothing!
- Okay, stay with me.

1207
01:20:06,515 --> 01:20:09,435
Here you are.
Watch your step. Okay.

1208
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:13,970
Without opening the door, not in
reach if we sit here, okay?

1209
01:20:13,971 --> 01:20:16,140
Got it?
Right.

1210
01:20:24,228 --> 01:20:26,010
Happened...

1211
01:20:26,899 --> 01:20:28,637
What?

1212
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:32,405
I opened the door and darkness
followed me, and in my dream.

1213
01:20:32,432 --> 01:20:34,550
Hey, come on.
Hey, hey, hey.

1214
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:38,083
- It was just a dream, just a dream.
- Excuse me.

1215
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:41,295
Jenson, never leave here.

1216
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:44,554
Sorry.

1217
01:21:30,963 --> 01:21:32,997
The camera is connected?

1218
01:21:33,417 --> 01:21:35,770
- I see the light.
- Yes

1219
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,322
Okay.

1220
01:21:41,337 --> 01:21:43,342
I have an idea.

1221
01:21:44,493 --> 01:21:47,668
Enough with the old game, Jenson,
are spending battery.

1222
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,266
No.

1223
01:21:50,502 --> 01:21:52,516
The portal...

1224
01:21:55,005 --> 01:21:59,295
What about"
holes that bend the space time continuum

1225
01:21:59,307 --> 01:22:03,009
and cause panic in the human brain"?

1226
01:22:03,026 --> 01:22:05,051
This is my plan...

1227
01:22:06,034 --> 01:22:07,892
See?

1228
01:22:09,773 --> 01:22:11,845
No controls...

1229
01:22:12,584 --> 01:22:14,605
Has no buttons...

1230
01:22:15,939 --> 01:22:20,321
Which means that it takes
you somewhere specific...

1231
01:22:20,643 --> 01:22:22,982
Or anywhere.

1232
01:22:23,663 --> 01:22:25,525
Nowhere.

1233
01:22:25,539 --> 01:22:27,555
What I think too.

1234
01:22:28,886 --> 01:22:31,390
But what if...
You...

1235
01:22:31,406 --> 01:22:33,303
Fix a place

1236
01:22:33,313 --> 01:22:35,485
clearly in mind,

1237
01:22:35,871 --> 01:22:40,161
you concentrate,
so to there that takes you.

1238
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:45,225
As they say, there's no place like home
us, it's easy.

1239
01:22:45,236 --> 01:22:47,242
Yes, easy.

1240
01:22:49,621 --> 01:22:53,692
And let's not blow
the mountains and such?

1241
01:22:54,721 --> 01:22:57,157
Do not know hope not.

1242
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:03,607
We will die here, Jenson.

1243
01:23:09,532 --> 01:23:11,568
This is it...

1244
01:23:12,831 --> 01:23:14,896
Or laboratory.

1245
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:20,739
Okay.

1246
01:23:21,339 --> 01:23:23,397
What do we do?

1247
01:23:26,407 --> 01:23:29,156
It will tell you what we'll do,

1248
01:23:31,154 --> 01:23:36,896
but I think there should be a place
fresh in his memory,

1249
01:23:36,921 --> 01:23:39,179
somewhere close by,

1250
01:23:39,195 --> 01:23:43,106
A place whose image is in your mind.

1251
01:23:43,127 --> 01:23:45,389
Outside the mountain.

1252
01:23:47,305 --> 01:23:49,374
Tells the other side of the door?

1253
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:51,841
It's the most fresh in our minds,

1254
01:23:51,863 --> 01:23:54,319
and now that the door is closed
,

1255
01:23:54,331 --> 01:23:57,471
protects us from those things, right?

1256
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:04,796
Okay.

1257
01:24:05,548 --> 01:24:07,328
Okay.

1258
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:39,944
I'm scared!

1259
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:55,432
"It's all right, and everybody has to
do exactly what he does"

1260
01:24:56,297 --> 01:24:58,171
Where is it?

1261
01:24:58,201 --> 01:25:00,535
Slaughterhouse 5.

1262
01:25:02,277 --> 01:25:04,360
Never read.

1263
01:25:08,249 --> 01:25:10,271
So here we go.

1264
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:40,579
Other bodies.

1265
01:25:45,962 --> 01:25:48,000
Vallik!

1266
01:25:48,026 --> 01:25:52,096
But I think all the tourists!
Who are they?

1267
01:25:52,455 --> 01:25:54,462
- Stay away!
- She heard him move away!

1268
01:25:54,463 --> 01:25:56,645
- Stop!
- We did not do anything!

1269
01:25:56,668 --> 01:26:00,242
- We just wanted to help.
- Alright...

1270
01:26:00,253 --> 01:26:08,141
The army declared quarantine
this site to find out what happened...

1271
01:26:08,142 --> 01:26:12,052
Return with others to the city, please.

1272
01:26:12,053 --> 01:26:14,122
- Go!
- Okay.

1273
01:26:23,418 --> 01:26:25,683
What are you doing?

1274
01:26:25,706 --> 01:26:29,702
How will discover what happened if
are removing everything?

1275
01:26:29,703 --> 01:26:31,710
- C'mon, Alya!
- Listen to the...

1276
01:26:31,726 --> 01:26:35,477
He knows what is best for you,
the situation is under our control.

1277
01:26:35,496 --> 01:26:38,827
Do not even know who they are.

1278
01:27:12,887 --> 01:27:14,896
Rest.

1279
01:27:24,111 --> 01:27:26,178
Left.

1280
01:27:32,933 --> 01:27:34,936
Rest.

1281
01:27:46,584 --> 01:27:50,129
- What are you doing?
- Placing them with others.

1282
01:27:50,152 --> 01:27:53,957
No, no. Dr. Miktenko
will want to look these.

1283
01:27:53,976 --> 01:27:59,103
- Let them separate.
- Why? They are the same from others.

1284
01:27:59,136 --> 01:28:01,145
Come on!

1285
01:28:24,183 --> 01:28:26,369
Look at these clothes,

1286
01:28:26,387 --> 01:28:29,142
never seen anything like this in life.

1287
01:28:33,503 --> 01:28:35,884
Put away them fast, fast!

1288
01:28:35,885 --> 01:28:37,956
Okay.

1289
01:28:43,298 --> 01:28:45,353
Hang them!

1290
01:29:04,615 --> 01:29:07,379
- Who are they?
- Perhaps the group Dyatlov.

1291
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:10,588
- Made a mistake coming here.
- No matter,

1292
01:29:10,607 --> 01:29:14,634
hurry, let's get out of here.

1293
01:29:16,315 --> 01:29:20,000
I hate this place,
gives me chills.

1294
01:29:49,806 --> 01:29:52,901
Also in 2013, the world's
leading scientists

1295
01:29:52,902 --> 01:29:56,990
are still unable to explain what
happened to the group Dyatlov.

1296
01:29:58,018 --> 01:30:01,819
But there are those who believe
that the answers are there,

1297
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:06,196
buried under snow and rocks,
waiting to be found...
