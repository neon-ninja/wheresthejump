1
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:56,475
- Should we pack everything?

2
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,475
I mean, how long
are we gonna be?

3
00:02:58,477 --> 00:03:01,313
- I don't really know
how fucking long but just

4
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,948
pack everything up and do
it as quickly as possible,

5
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,950
okay?

6
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,655
- Jason?

7
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:16,261
- Just pack everything,
right now.

8
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,263
- Okay.

9
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,799
- It's gonna be okay.

10
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,403
- Okay, okay.

11
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,940
- Berries.

12
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,476
Red berries.

13
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:16,916
Okay.

14
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:42,941
Okay.

15
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Okay.

16
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,111
- The department
of health has been notified

17
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,713
by the federal emergency
management agency

18
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:32,551
that a viral infection has
severely infected the population.

19
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,619
Symptoms of the virus
include a small circular

20
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,122
red rash on the abdomen
or chest and is followed

21
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,758
by nausea, delirium and
aggressive outbursts

22
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,226
or unpredictable behavior.

23
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:44,029
If you or anyone you know are
exhibiting these symptoms,

24
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,832
immediately contact
emergency medical services.

25
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,767
Officials have been
advised that at this time

26
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,903
the viral infection poses an
immediate danger to the public.

27
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,573
As a precaution, resident
should stay indoors,

28
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,975
keep all windows, doors and
vents closed.

29
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,144
Turn off all air
conditioners, ration your...

30
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,516
- Stop, stop the car.

31
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,018
Jason stop the car.

32
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,921
Christ, Jason,
stop the fucking car.

33
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:10,789
They have a child.

34
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,791
- So do we!

35
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,592
Okay?

36
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,529
So do we.

37
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,907
- Hi there, how are you?

38
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:40,745
Looks like it's going
to be a beautiful day.

39
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,718
Do you want to play?

40
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:53,124
I miss you, hope to see
you soon.

41
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,899
- One, two, three, four.

42
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,640
One, two, three, four.

43
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,679
One, two, three.

44
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,230
Fuck, fuck!

45
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:10,903
Fuck.

46
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,841
- The most important thing
here is the saw-tooth leaf.

47
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,375
Turns red during the spring
time.

48
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,377
See that?

49
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,912
Okay.

50
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,215
How to make a deadfall trap,
you need a

51
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,150
support stick, a weight
stick, a bait stick.

52
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,150
Okay?

53
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:37,021
And you set them up, notches
matching, balance the...

54
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,791
Ann, are you listening?

55
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,791
This is important.

56
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:45,363
- Yes, I can't write as fast
as you can fucking talk.

57
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,365
Okay.

58
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,004
- Don't curse in front of her.

59
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,775
- Fine.

60
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,347
- Red berries.

61
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,349
Red leaves.

62
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,117
It's a bad thing.

63
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,354
Especially during the spring.

64
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,863
You're jerking the trigger.

65
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:19,998
- And I hit it!

66
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
- That's 'cause it's not moving.

67
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,569
It's a rabbit gun, you need
to hit head or heart to kill

68
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,238
so I need you to control
your breathing and lightly...

69
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,440
- squeeze, not pull, I know.

70
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,110
We should save our bullets.

71
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:36,147
- Well, they're of no use if
you don't know how to shoot.

72
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,082
- How many do we have?

73
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,051
- Enough.

74
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,487
Do it again.

75
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:06,477
- We can't survive on
a handful of berries.

76
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,448
- I know.

77
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,445
- Hi there, how are you?

78
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:47,418
Looks like it's going
to be a beautiful day.

79
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,479
- Okay.

80
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,822
- Hi there, how are you?

81
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,791
Hi there, how are you?

82
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,759
Hi there, how are you?

83
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,795
Hi there, how are you?

84
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,830
Hi there, how are you?

85
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:48,099
Hi there, how are you?

86
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,068
Hi there, how are you?

87
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,836
Hi there, how are you?

88
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,105
Hi there, how are you?

89
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,274
Hi there, how are you?

90
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,745
- Damn it!

91
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,498
Fuck!

92
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,783
Jason, what happened?

93
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:33,984
- No, don't touch me!

94
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,554
Just get everything in the car.

95
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,022
- What happened?

96
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,524
- Just get in the fucking car!

97
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,003
Her fever break?

98
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,138
- No.

99
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,539
Jason, what happened?

100
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,477
- There were a few boxes
of food.

101
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,479
- But they were there.

102
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:02,481
- Yeah.

103
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,416
They were there.

104
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:07,685
- But you've avoided them
before.

105
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:08,919
Why did they attack this time?

106
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,087
I don't know.

107
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,089
I don't.

108
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:16,994
There was enough food to eat
there, there was enough bodies.

109
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,767
I thought they would've
moved on.

110
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,738
Everything was fine until
I cut myself breaking

111
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,073
into that house.

112
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:33,611
The blood started flowing
and screams grew

113
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,415
and they swarmed.

114
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,555
It was like they knew.

115
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:46,690
They knew I was bleeding.

116
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,661
They could sense it.

117
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,130
- What are they?

118
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,735
- I don't know.

119
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,008
But some part of them is human.

120
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,810
- Why is that?

121
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,114
- Because they can die.

122
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,693
- Come on, come on.

123
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:45,643
Come on.

124
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:50,915
Come on.

125
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:53,785
Please.

126
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,035
Please, please.

127
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,003
Chris.

128
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,043
- Is he infected?

129
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,281
- No.

130
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,588
- Show me.

131
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,109
- Your name?

132
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:55,045
- Olivia.

133
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,284
You'll help him?

134
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,154
I can do that.

135
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,663
- Press here.

136
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,166
He'll be okay.

137
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,007
Grab an arm.

138
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,960
You coming from the south?

139
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,096
You and your father...

140
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,098
- stepdad.

141
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,134
Well, sort of.

142
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:28,072
Chris and my mom were,
you know, together, but

143
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,075
they never married.

144
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,746
They planned it for September,
but...

145
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:47,858
- You can sleep in the car
if you want.

146
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,926
- No, it's fine.

147
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:51,061
I want to sleep near him.

148
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:58,802
We'll leave, when he's better,
I mean.

149
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,439
We'll leave you alone.

150
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,944
Why do you have two campsites?

151
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:16,980
- In case I lose one
or the other.

152
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:17,982
- Oh.

153
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,202
- Helps cover your scent,
throws them off.

154
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,225
You headed north?

155
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:10,994
- Yeah.

156
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,399
- You wanna hear it?

157
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,680
- That's what's up north?

158
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,416
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,387
- Do you know what
they're saying?

160
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:11,389
- No.

161
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,263
- So that's it.

162
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,634
- That's all there is.

163
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,157
- Chris?

164
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,128
- It's alright, Liv.

165
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:54,065
It's okay.

166
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:07,110
- She says you're heading north.

167
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,213
- Yeah, trying to at least.

168
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,085
We hear it's in check up there.

169
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,188
Who the fuck knows, right?

170
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,497
You have a pretty nice setup
here.

171
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,669
Most people would kill
for this stuff.

172
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,805
You gotta tent.

173
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,641
Food, from what I can tell.

174
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:38,643
Car.

175
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:47,217
You gotta full tank?
- No.

176
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,690
Just a place to hide
from the rain.

177
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,539
- Ugh.

178
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
Thank you.

179
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,120
For what you did,
for both of us.

180
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:28,291
Not a lot of people
would do that nowadays.

181
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,566
We'll be gone in the morning.

182
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:37,568
- Okay.

183
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,706
- Get up, kiddo, let's go.

184
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,641
Let's get in the tent.

185
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,585
- Come on, get in!

186
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,918
- So, how long you been
out here?

187
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,621
- Since it started.

188
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:07,991
- Hmm.

189
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:14,631
Why you all the way out here
in the middle of nowhere?

190
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:21,371
- My husband grew up
in these woods.

191
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:24,507
He lived in a town
a mile or two west.

192
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,509
He brought us out here.

193
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,946
It's where he felt safest.

194
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:36,353
- Is that who taught you
how to be woods woman-y?

195
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,326
- He taught me what he could.

196
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:45,795
- What?

197
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,264
- Come on, Liv.

198
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:43,785
We kept hearing things,
you know.

199
00:38:43,787 --> 00:38:45,955
How Philly went down in
a day but some backwater,

200
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:50,527
berg like bethel didn't
get hit for a month.

201
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:54,431
So Suzanne, Liv's mom,
she said, "let's wait."

202
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,968
Let's just fucking wait.

203
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,873
She even thought that the
red cross was handing out

204
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,609
the cure in bottles over
in trout run.

205
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,013
Turns out they were just
handing out hot chocolate

206
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,948
and cheese sandwiches.

207
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:18,555
And then Suzy got some sores
on her belly,

208
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,361
they just looked like
little circles.

209
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:25,363
You know?

210
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,964
Little flea bites.

211
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:34,637
And then they started
getting worse.

212
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:39,709
Started bleeding and giving
off some sort of white puss.

213
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,747
Two days later, she,
she attacked Liv.

214
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:55,492
She tried to rip her
apart with her bare hands.

215
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:03,133
So that's when I tied her
to the bed.

216
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,505
And all she did was scream.

217
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,780
We left her there
for a few days.

218
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,787
Just listening to her scream.

219
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,727
- You just left her?

220
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:32,061
Tied to the bed?

221
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:43,506
- In a way,

222
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,076
yeah.

223
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,050
I took a kitchen knife and,

224
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,888
shoved it in her ear.

225
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,960
And I kept on pushing
and pushing.

226
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,231
Until the screams stopped.

227
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:21,077
I like to think that
she forgave me, though.

228
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,148
That she heard me say I'm
sorry and believed it.

229
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,880
- Oh, my god, oh my god, no!

230
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:31,748
- Come on, you're going in!

231
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,682
Here we go!

232
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:33,684
Bath time.

233
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:40,256
What, I didn't even throw
you in.

234
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:41,256
- Oh my god.

235
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,892
- These waters aren't
even that cold.

236
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:46,095
- Oh man.
- See, it's nice.

237
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:48,298
- It looks awful.

238
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,668
- I don't trust you
behind me, get out of here.

239
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,336
- Well, I can push you.

240
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:07,884
God, are there even
any fish here?

241
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:10,053
- Law of the lake, Liv.

242
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:13,923
Where there are fishermen,
there are no fish.

243
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,694
- Yeah, but we're on a river.

244
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:21,130
- Rules still apply.

245
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,868
I went on this fishing
trip once with Matt Theil.

246
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,870
You remember Matt, Liv?

247
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,942
Guy was built like a fucking
tank.

248
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:36,813
He could open bottles
of beer with his teeth.

249
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,016
Use to play call of duty 24/7.

250
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:42,752
Anyway, Matt rented a boat one
time, well, it wasn't really

251
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:44,654
a boat, it was more of a skiff.

252
00:43:44,656 --> 00:43:46,389
Tiny one at that, couldn't
even fit a case of fucking

253
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:47,757
natty light in it.

254
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:48,759
- Stop.

255
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,995
- What?

256
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:52,997
- Just

257
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:54,964
stop.

258
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,234
- Okay.

259
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:20,023
Hey, why did you stop
me earlier at the river?

260
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,829
- You know sometimes you,

261
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:30,299
it feels like you forget
what's out there.

262
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,670
I don't know, one minute
you're telling me about

263
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:36,139
how you killed your wife.

264
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:38,708
And the next, it's just like,

265
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:42,378
we're on a weekend camping trip.

266
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,848
We'll all return to normalcy
on Monday.

267
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,452
You know those rings
your wife had?

268
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:56,259
We saw them before anyone
knew what was going on.

269
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:01,464
We get patients in the
er oozing puss and blood.

270
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:07,437
The rings just devouring
the skin around it.

271
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:13,209
Feeding on it like it knew
what it was gonna become.

272
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:20,883
The only thing keeping them
down there

273
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:24,921
is the fact that they haven't
eaten all the bodies yet.

274
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:27,857
You know, all those people
like your wife,

275
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:30,326
just left and tied to the bed.

276
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:34,097
I can't.

277
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,835
I can't just choose to forget
that.

278
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,275
- I didn't forget.

279
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:52,482
I just choose what to remember
and when to remember it.

280
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:06,896
Get some sleep, alright?

281
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:14,137
- They took two
houses before I found

282
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:15,471
the last amount.

283
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:22,011
- Hailey needs something
to bring her fever down.

284
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:23,412
And we need food.

285
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,916
You can't just quit.

286
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:34,290
You brought us out here
for a reason, Jason.

287
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,928
This was your call.

288
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,297
And we survived.

289
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:45,168
We've gotten by.

290
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,971
- Getting by isn't life.

291
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:54,177
- Getting by is all
we have left.

292
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,119
You need to go.

293
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,460
- Yeah.

294
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,603
Will this mud work?

295
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:23,005
- I don't know.

296
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,341
Should mask the scent.

297
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,909
- Right.

298
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:27,911
- Gosh.

299
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:30,214
I'm sorry.

300
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,987
- Hey, hey.

301
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:40,189
We're not just getting by.

302
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:45,361
We have more left
than you think.

303
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,298
- Okay.

304
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:33,636
- You seen her?

305
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:34,638
- Nah-uh.

306
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,712
When are we leaving?

307
00:49:42,714 --> 00:49:43,714
- Soon.

308
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,652
- You always say we have
to keep moving.

309
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:51,454
Those who stay, die.

310
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,458
- We'll keep going,
just not yet.

311
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,528
- So what, we're staying
because of her?

312
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,430
- No, we're staying because
she has access to food

313
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:02,432
and water.

314
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:07,103
We should be thankful, Liv.

315
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:11,173
- Why does it matter if
we're leaving anyway?

316
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,275
- Well, it does matter.

317
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:14,610
She deserves it.

318
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,047
Lord knows what she's
been through.

319
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:20,047
- Yeah but we've been through...

320
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:22,385
- we'll, we've all been
through shit, Liv.

321
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:27,156
But at least you and I
had each other.

322
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:29,225
She didn't have anybody.

323
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:52,548
Shit.

324
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,350
- Here.

325
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:55,350
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

326
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:56,619
- Let me see.
- No, it's fine.

327
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:58,354
- Let me see.

328
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:10,533
Why do you still wear it?

329
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,202
- Habit, I guess.

330
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,286
- I use to love that show.

331
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:35,724
- My daughter
loved the colorful ones.

332
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:39,128
What happened to them?

333
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,729
Your family, I mean.

334
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:45,501
- Same thing that happened
to everyone elses.

335
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,394
- You're rationing.

336
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:46,396
- Yeah.

337
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,632
Can't always find food
on the road.

338
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:50,766
- You're leaving, then.

339
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:51,901
- Yeah, soon.

340
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:55,771
- You can take more if...

341
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:57,573
- nah, nah, please.

342
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:58,941
The more food we take, the
more you have to go down there

343
00:52:58,943 --> 00:53:00,276
and get some.

344
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,615
Hey, why don't you come with us?

345
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:08,484
Why not?

346
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:10,686
- How do you know
if what's out there

347
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:13,255
is any better than what's here?

348
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:14,755
- I guess we don't really.

349
00:53:14,757 --> 00:53:18,194
But, I mean, this place can only
be paradise for so long.

350
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:19,929
- It's not a paradise.

351
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:27,670
You've got Liv so you need
to find a place to survive.

352
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:29,471
For you, it's north.

353
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:32,341
For me, it's here.

354
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,784
- Hey, what would you give me
if I hit that tree right there?

355
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,784
What are you, like five?

356
00:54:50,786 --> 00:54:53,322
- I am 12, thank you very much.

357
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:54,356
Seriously, what are you gonna
give me?

358
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:56,292
That tree right there.

359
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:58,794
- Um.

360
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,332
I'll cook you dinner.

361
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,435
- Dinner, really?

362
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,571
You cook us dinner every night.

363
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:11,907
Plus that tree's 50 yards away.

364
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:12,908
- 50 yards?

365
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,310
- Uh 30, tops.

366
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:16,812
- Alright, fine.

367
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,748
Still, what are you
gonna give me?

368
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,489
- Fine.

369
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:31,960
We won't ration.

370
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:34,663
- My god, you have to.

371
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:35,931
You have to!

372
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:37,800
- So from here, is this okay?

373
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:40,836
- Yeah and you have to
make precisely that,

374
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,572
you see that little hole
at the bottom there?

375
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:44,606
- The one right in the middle.

376
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:45,541
- Yeah.

377
00:55:45,543 --> 00:55:46,875
That.

378
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:47,877
- Alright.

379
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:52,348
What are you gonna give me?

380
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,783
- The dinner thing.

381
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:57,019
- You can't have that
thing, that's Ann's thing.

382
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:59,555
- Yeah but we get to eat more
than four fucking crackers.

383
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:02,791
- Alright, fine then,
but what are you gonna give me?

384
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:03,793
Come on.

385
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:06,662
- We can swim.

386
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,565
- Really?

387
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:10,899
- Yeah.

388
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,603
- You hate swimming.

389
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:15,904
- You hate swimming?

390
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:17,439
- Just in lakes.

391
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,877
I don't like not seeing
the bottom.

392
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:22,879
- Alright.

393
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:27,516
This right here, it's for all
the marbles.

394
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:28,650
- Okay, come one.

395
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:31,387
- Big ol' dinner and swim time.

396
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:32,389
Alright? Here we go.

397
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,659
Oh wait, no, no, I slipped.
- Oh, nope, nope.

398
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:38,659
That was a false start.

399
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,662
Give me one more shot,
I get a second shot.

400
00:56:40,664 --> 00:56:41,797
Come on, now.

401
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:49,405
- Oh my god,
something just touched my foot.

402
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,107
Did it again.

403
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,877
- What?

404
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,614
- Nothing.

405
00:56:58,616 --> 00:57:00,749
- It's not nothing.

406
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,886
- It's nothing.

407
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,858
Yeah, it's nothing.

408
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,567
Oops, sorry.

409
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,006
See you later.

410
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,461
Mmm. Never thought I'd miss
this shit.

411
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:44,860
Oh, you want me to make you one?

412
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:46,695
I'm really good.

413
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,800
Let me try.

414
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:54,536
There we go.

415
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,539
Little beet.

416
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:00,943
Little olive.

417
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,011
There you go.

418
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,056
It's good, right?

419
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:16,492
Need more cheese, though?

420
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:18,694
Here.

421
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:19,696
Come on.

422
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,200
Want some cheese, Liv?

423
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:46,955
- She looks like mom.

424
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,760
I mean, not the hair but.

425
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,132
She's good at this stuff,
you know?

426
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:02,237
I mean, if it was me,
I would just be like, ah!

427
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:10,846
Is that why you want her
to come with us?

428
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:18,220
I mean, 'cause she's good
at this kind of thing?

429
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:23,659
- Now, where would we be if
she didn't find us that day?

430
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:27,696
I'd be dead and you'd be alone.

431
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:29,565
Nobody deserves that.

432
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:31,867
Not you, not her.

433
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:40,008
I want her to come
because of you.

434
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,945
Because she takes good
care of us.

435
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:49,117
Because I wanna take care
of her, too.

436
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,172
- Can I try that on?

437
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:15,811
- Sure.

438
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:25,954
- How did he ask you?

439
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:27,990
- Well.

440
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:36,131
I found out I was pregnant
on a Friday.

441
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,701
It was late and I told him.

442
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,939
And he just looked at me
and he left.

443
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:53,415
At midnight, he came
back, smelling like liquor

444
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:56,718
and he just sat down
at the edge of the bed

445
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,387
and showed me a ring.

446
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:03,325
He didn't asked me,
but I said yes.

447
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:07,095
And then we went to bed.

448
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:13,035
I think it came from a pawnshop.

449
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,439
Part of me didn't care.

450
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:22,878
Somehow I knew that was the
only way it would happen.

451
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,251
- Chris took my mom to Maui.

452
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:35,257
He asked her on the beach
during a sunset.

453
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:38,860
She said it was the best day
of her life.

454
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,865
It's nice.

455
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:44,867
- It is.

456
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,372
Sorta weird to think it was
someone else's

457
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:52,174
before it was yours.

458
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:13,248
- Yes.

459
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,216
Okay.

460
01:04:14,218 --> 01:04:16,084
I'll be back.

461
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:17,953
Mama loves you, okay?

462
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,959
Alright, you know that?

463
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:26,361
You know how much I love you?

464
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,235
Bye, baby girl.

465
01:04:33,237 --> 01:04:35,203
Bye, sweetness.

466
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:39,008
Okay.

467
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

468
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:45,827
Shh, mama's here.

469
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,197
I'm so sorry I left you.

470
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:51,633
I'm so sorry.

471
01:07:51,635 --> 01:07:53,268
I'm so sorry.

472
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:53,628
- Y'know, I don't
know anything about you

473
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,497
other than the fact that
you're stubborn.

474
01:08:55,499 --> 01:08:57,165
- I'm not stubborn.

475
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:58,165
- Aha!

476
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,902
Only stubborn people
instantly deny being stubborn.

477
01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:02,370
- It's called entrapment.

478
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:03,872
- Maybe.

479
01:09:03,874 --> 01:09:06,272
But now we know beyond a shadow
of a doubt

480
01:09:06,274 --> 01:09:09,911
that you, Ann, whatever
the hell your last name is,

481
01:09:09,913 --> 01:09:11,179
is stubborn.

482
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:14,816
- You're good at that.

483
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:16,284
- What exactly?

484
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:20,488
- Making me forget why I'm here.

485
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,367
Goodnight, Chris.

486
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,771
- Goodnight.

487
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:41,529
Come with us.

488
01:11:41,531 --> 01:11:42,563
- We've talked about this.

489
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:45,900
- Things can change.

490
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,890
Annabelle rose Marshall.

491
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:54,028
Organ donor.

492
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:56,731
Good for you.

493
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:06,741
- Stay.

494
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,045
Stay right here.

495
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:12,047
Stay.

496
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,050
- No. We can't.

497
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:24,025
Those that stay put, die here.

498
01:14:24,027 --> 01:14:25,693
- Well, I'm alive.

499
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:31,499
- Yeah, but look what
happened to your family.

500
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,072
Ann, I didn't mean it.

501
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,989
Ann, I'm so sorry, I didn't...

502
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,224
- she must've taken some.

503
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:32,927
I mean, there was at
least a box of crackers...

504
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:37,231
- Oh fuck! Olivia!

505
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:38,199
- Chris!

506
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:40,668
Chris, wait!

507
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:42,603
- Olivia!

508
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:49,810
- Liv, where are you?

509
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:52,681
Olivia!

510
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:08,956
- Did you get any in your mouth?

511
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:11,359
Liv?

512
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:13,327
- No.

513
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:14,662
- You?

514
01:17:14,664 --> 01:17:17,198
- No, I don't think so.

515
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,934
- You would've tasted it.

516
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:28,409
- That thing that came up here.

517
01:17:28,411 --> 01:17:30,044
- They didn't.

518
01:17:30,046 --> 01:17:32,647
Food must be scarce.

519
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:34,649
- You still wanna stay.

520
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:41,856
We're leaving in the morning.

521
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,260
- How are you, pretty girl?

522
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:48,996
What do you see?

523
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,098
What do you see?

524
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:54,101
Yes, you like being
with your mama?

525
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:03,811
Yes, yes, here we go.

526
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:18,159
Oh, Hailey.

527
01:18:18,161 --> 01:18:19,894
Come here, my love.

528
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:22,096
Here we go, here we go.

529
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,384
I'm so sorry.

530
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,353
I'm so sorry.

531
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:02,136
Chris.

532
01:19:02,138 --> 01:19:03,337
Chris, stop.

533
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:04,505
- Why won't you come with us?

534
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:05,840
- Because,

535
01:19:05,842 --> 01:19:07,174
I'm, I'm not ready.

536
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:09,376
- You're gonna fucking die here!

537
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:12,780
- Well, maybe I deserve
to fucking die here.

538
01:19:12,782 --> 01:19:14,915
- Oh, so that's what this is.

539
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:17,384
This is some sorta punishment.

540
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:19,887
Fucking atone for whatever
it is you did

541
01:19:19,889 --> 01:19:21,255
and move on, already.

542
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:23,157
- This isn't a world
where you can just forgive

543
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:24,225
and move on.

544
01:19:24,227 --> 01:19:28,262
We use to be able to fuck
up and then say you're sorry

545
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:31,966
and feel better until the
next time you fuck up.

546
01:19:31,968 --> 01:19:35,035
With my daughter, there was
no next time.

547
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:37,905
So who can I apologize to?

548
01:19:37,907 --> 01:19:39,273
Huh, Chris?

549
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:41,075
There's no one here.

550
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:43,944
- Yeah well, my wife,

551
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,514
she isn't here either.

552
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:51,318
I fucking killed her in
front of her daughter.

553
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:54,321
And it doesn't matter if
she was one of them or not,

554
01:19:54,323 --> 01:19:55,856
I confronted it.

555
01:19:55,858 --> 01:20:01,128
And I don't blame me, I don't
blame her, I blame them.

556
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:06,267
The only world that won't
right itself, Ann, is your own.

557
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:12,973
And the reason for that
is because of you.

558
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:17,144
Not because of what happened
here or what's north, you.

559
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:23,217
Look, your family, they
aren't here anymore,

560
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:26,887
but you are.

561
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:34,195
So please, just tell yourself
you're sorry, accept it

562
01:20:34,197 --> 01:20:36,864
and move the fuck on, already.

563
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:20,908
- We're gonna need more food.

564
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:25,379
And I won't be able
to get it by myself.

565
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:28,048
- You just tell me what to do.

566
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:31,252
- I'm coming, too.

567
01:21:31,254 --> 01:21:32,119
- Liv, no your not.

568
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:33,954
- I'm coming!

569
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:38,626
I'm just the same as Ann
or anyone else, I can help.

570
01:21:38,628 --> 01:21:42,096
Three carrying food is better
than two.

571
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:46,934
- Fine.

572
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:50,404
- Chris will distract them.

573
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:54,108
All you and I will do
is fill our packs

574
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,042
with everything you can.

575
01:21:55,044 --> 01:21:57,111
Just food, nothing else.

576
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,414
And then we run.

577
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:05,152
First sign of them, you
run, don't worry about me.

578
01:22:05,154 --> 01:22:06,154
Okay, Liv?

579
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:12,326
Liv, you okay?

580
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,262
- Yeah, I'm fine.

581
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:18,098
- Okay.

582
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:39,553
Hey.

583
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:42,690
Look, we're all gonna be fine.

584
01:22:42,692 --> 01:22:44,959
Chris, Chris is gonna be fine.

585
01:22:44,961 --> 01:22:45,961
- I know.

586
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:49,296
I know he's gonna be fine.

587
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:32,339
That's us. Let's go.

588
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:19,620
Grab any food you can find.

589
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:28,328
Liv, we gotta be quick!

590
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:43,744
Just grab any food you can.

591
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:04,264
Olivia, what the hell?

592
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,266
We gotta go.

593
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:49,743
What are you...

594
01:25:50,745 --> 01:25:53,247
We have to, we have to...

595
01:25:53,249 --> 01:25:54,314
We have to...

596
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:58,852
- Thought it would bleed more.

597
01:26:04,627 --> 01:26:05,759
- No!

598
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:06,761
Don't!

599
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

600
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:45,618
- Liv!

601
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:47,354
What's wrong?
- They're after me,

602
01:28:47,356 --> 01:28:48,021
- where's Ann?

603
01:28:48,023 --> 01:28:48,889
No, they're not.

604
01:28:48,891 --> 01:28:49,756
I lost them.

605
01:28:49,758 --> 01:28:51,425
Where's Ann?

606
01:28:51,427 --> 01:28:52,092
- She...

607
01:28:52,094 --> 01:28:53,560
- where's Ann?

608
01:28:53,562 --> 01:28:54,562
- She's...

609
01:29:00,035 --> 01:29:01,035
- Oh fuck!

610
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:07,808
Get in the car.

611
01:29:08,976 --> 01:29:11,912
- Chris, I...
- Get in the fucking car!

612
01:29:27,729 --> 01:29:28,729
- Olivia!

613
01:31:31,752 --> 01:31:32,752
- Okay.
