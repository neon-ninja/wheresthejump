1
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,408
Happy birthday to me!

2
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:54,509
Happy birthday!

3
00:01:03,418 --> 00:01:05,120
- Oh, my God!
- Anybody want this?

4
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:14,395
That's what happens when
you do a mercy invite.

5
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:17,098
I believed you wanted
to invite everyone.

6
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:20,168
Dad, I can't invite everyone in
my art class except for one person

7
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:22,103
without social networking evidence

8
00:01:22,137 --> 00:01:24,272
inflicting more pain on that
person than was intended.

9
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:25,406
And I'm not a monster.

10
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,343
I'm proud of you. I think.

11
00:01:28,376 --> 00:01:30,745
She gets detention a lot and she yells

12
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:32,780
at teachers sometimes.

13
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:34,782
There was that rumor that went around

14
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:36,684
that she just kept
running away from home.

15
00:01:36,717 --> 00:01:37,685
Um, maybe she can Uber.

16
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:39,654
I seriously believe that
we can go home now.

17
00:01:39,687 --> 00:01:42,323
Um, did I mistakenly convey
this was a democracy?

18
00:01:42,357 --> 00:01:45,126
We are not going
till she gets picked up.

19
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:51,032
Uh, the car broke down.

20
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:52,033
I'm just gonna take the bus.

21
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:54,269
You're not taking a bus.
I'll drive you home.

22
00:01:54,302 --> 00:01:56,637
Claire has almost saved her half of
the money she needs for a car.

23
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:58,139
Isn't that right?

24
00:01:58,173 --> 00:02:02,143
This'll be one of the few times left
I can drive you guys around. Huh?

25
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:04,812
Uh, I...

26
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:07,082
You won't be able to hear
my dad tell jokes

27
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:08,583
that only he thinks are funny

28
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:11,419
for an entire car ride unless you come.

29
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:13,388
You don't really wanna miss that.

30
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:22,397
Wow! I got more gifts
than I thought I did.

31
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:25,500
Can I put this in here?

32
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:28,303
Yeah, I'll get it.
Thank you, Marcia.

33
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:29,404
Maybe he just is into...

34
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:33,341
Maybe he's just content where he is.

35
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:43,818
Hey. Can I help you?

36
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:47,355
What?

37
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:49,490
This is the one.
He's really funny.

38
00:02:49,524 --> 00:02:52,193
He does these weekly videos.

39
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:57,398
See? It's so random.
That is so weird.

40
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:01,569
Yeah, you have a crush on him.

41
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:02,437
- I don't get it.
- Pause it.

42
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,471
Yeah, go back.
Why don't you get it?

43
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:06,307
I just don't get it.
He's blond and he's cute.

44
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,409
No, his eyebrows are just like...

45
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:09,610
Shut up. His eyebrows?

46
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:10,845
That's the one thing you couldn't get?

47
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:12,347
Yeah.

48
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:19,787
Oh, my God.

49
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:25,226
Oh. You see what he does, though?

50
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,894
How does he even do that?

51
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,329
That's the whole point
why I'm showing you.

52
00:03:28,363 --> 00:03:29,697
Genius!

53
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:32,300
So bad.

54
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:45,713
Hey!

55
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:47,748
Pardon me, sir. I think
you have the wrong car.

56
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:31,912
We woke up in here.

57
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:42,056
What the hell is going on?

58
00:06:42,957 --> 00:06:44,659
What are we doing here?

59
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:46,694
What happened to my dad?

60
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:47,895
He's out there.

61
00:06:50,965 --> 00:06:52,933
Do you know what happened to my dad?

62
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:48,956
I choose you first.

63
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:57,532
It's only gonna be a minute.

64
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,439
Pee on yourself.

65
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:05,873
Pee on yourself.

66
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:08,909
No!

67
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:19,420
No.

68
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:20,888
No!

69
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:23,991
No!

70
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:25,426
No!

71
00:08:26,193 --> 00:08:28,162
Open the door!

72
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:45,646
Hey, are you okay?

73
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:49,650
He wanted me to dance for him.

74
00:08:57,658 --> 00:08:59,093
The outside door is locked.

75
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,732
Everything's okay.

76
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:08,135
We're okay.

77
00:09:10,505 --> 00:09:11,506
We're okay.

78
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:21,816
I hear the tiniest little splash

79
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:23,551
and here it comes.

80
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:26,220
A freak of nature, like this.

81
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:28,523
So, he comes across the stream

82
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:30,124
and he's so tall

83
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:33,127
that the water doesn't even
get to his belly.

84
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,229
Then he stops.

85
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:37,965
And my heart's coming out of my chest.

86
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:41,035
You got buck fever.

87
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:44,238
Uncle John's got buck fever.

88
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:45,973
That's not true, Casey.
Your daddy's a liar.

89
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:47,207
How big was the rack?

90
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:48,909
It was huge.

91
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:50,611
Where are you supposed to
look when you shoot, Casey?

92
00:09:50,645 --> 00:09:51,779
At the body.

93
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:53,080
Then why was he looking at the rack?

94
00:09:53,113 --> 00:09:55,049
'Cause he had buck fever.

95
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:57,985
She'll say anything you say.

96
00:09:58,018 --> 00:09:59,720
You gonna do that when you get your

97
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:01,021
mentored hunting license in three years?

98
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:03,257
No, sir.

99
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,926
Make sure you put your
gloves on after you finish.

100
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,062
Your feet and your hands
get cold first out there.

101
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:38,125
Three students abducted.

102
00:10:38,158 --> 00:10:39,727
The father of one of the students

103
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,028
woke up dazed in King of Prussia,

104
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:42,129
reportedly drugged.

105
00:10:42,162 --> 00:10:44,832
He found the kids and the car missing.

106
00:10:44,865 --> 00:10:46,834
Neighbors are in disbelief.

107
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:48,202
A normally quiet community

108
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:50,170
is reeling after this abduction.

109
00:10:51,872 --> 00:10:55,142
If you have any information concerning
the whereabouts of these girls,

110
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:57,277
you are urged to contact the police.

111
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:16,964
It doesn't matter
if you open that door, Claire.

112
00:11:16,997 --> 00:11:20,134
There's a second locked door.

113
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,336
He's gonna come in
here again, any second,

114
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:24,805
and we're not letting him
take one of us out again.

115
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:30,110
We just cried and screamed
and we didn't hurt him

116
00:11:30,144 --> 00:11:32,980
because we were afraid to get him upset.

117
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:35,916
God, that's victim shit. Jesus!

118
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,085
We should fight him.

119
00:11:38,118 --> 00:11:40,254
We should drop a crazy-ass bomb on him.

120
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:42,690
I saw him carry one of you

121
00:11:42,723 --> 00:11:44,625
and lay you on the bed
like you weighed nothing.

122
00:11:46,193 --> 00:11:48,195
One punch from him
would knock one of us out.

123
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:52,867
I took six months of Kenpo karate class.

124
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,803
And you distract
the assailant with pain.

125
00:11:55,836 --> 00:11:59,006
Everything is so easy for you guys.

126
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,141
You do one thing, you can
predict the next thing.

127
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:06,346
It's not the way it's gonna be
in this situation.

128
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,348
We're not getting out of here.

129
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:11,118
You're saying that you're not gonna
fight with everything in you?

130
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:15,055
You know the only chance...

131
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,193
The only chance we have is if
all three of us go crazy on this guy.

132
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:23,163
We have to hurry.

133
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:29,737
We need you, Casey.

134
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,306
Claire's smart. Let's listen to her.

135
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:36,210
I'll do it if you're gonna do it, too.

136
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:40,114
We can win.

137
00:12:40,147 --> 00:12:41,315
He'll hurt us.

138
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:45,052
No. Shut up.

139
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,222
Both of you.

140
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,892
You're gonna pick your miserable
self up and help us get out of here.

141
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:56,263
Blow me.

142
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:59,900
And your six months of karate at the
King of Prussia Mall can blow me, too.

143
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:02,002
No! No, no, you can't do this today!

144
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:03,904
You can't do this right now.

145
00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:05,840
Why do you do this?
Why do you act like this?

146
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:07,241
Why do you act like
you're not one of us?

147
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,182
When you're aiming, Casey,

148
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,886
always keep both eyes open.

149
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,187
Cover your target with the barrel

150
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,458
then move with it to get its pace.

151
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:27,227
I'm warning you, it's gonna be
frustrating the first times.

152
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:29,964
You're gonna shoot
under it or behind it.

153
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:31,398
You'll learn to stay with it.

154
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,069
Females are smarter than the males.

155
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:36,804
But you know that, it's like humans.

156
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:40,908
Females use their nose to stay alive.

157
00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:43,277
They make sure they have cover.

158
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,413
They always remember they're
trying to stay alive.

159
00:13:46,446 --> 00:13:49,283
Bucks go off by themselves.

160
00:13:49,316 --> 00:13:52,186
Bucks get dumb during mating season.

161
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:54,889
Boys make too much noise.

162
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:57,124
Yes, they do.

163
00:13:57,157 --> 00:13:58,826
I'm better than a boy, right?

164
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:01,929
Yes, you are.

165
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:02,930
Hey

166
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:11,939
I'll let you know when I hear
something that makes sense.

167
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,778
We don't even know what this is yet.

168
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:26,253
Hey! I was inspired.

169
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:32,960
No, no, no, that one.

170
00:14:32,993 --> 00:14:35,395
That one, before the pink
frock coat with the thorns.

171
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:37,932
That's supposed to be
like a tailored jacket,

172
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:40,300
but I'm gonna hand-print it
with newspaper headlines.

173
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:46,773
I'm a simple blouse and
skirt person, but these...

174
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:52,179
These are very artistic, Barry.

175
00:14:52,212 --> 00:14:56,583
Just the kind of thing Hamptons
ladies would spend $15,000 on

176
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:58,853
to wear once at a charity ball.

177
00:14:58,886 --> 00:15:00,554
Shut up!

178
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:03,090
You know, I can't stay too long.

179
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:04,925
This is just a visit.

180
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,793
Well, tell me what's going on.

181
00:15:08,628 --> 00:15:10,397
What, you mean the email?

182
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,899
No, just the usual things.

183
00:15:11,932 --> 00:15:13,367
Just feelings of being overwhelmed.

184
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,938
The terseness of your email made it
sound specific and time-related.

185
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:19,606
Are you looking for something?

186
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,308
- No.
- No?

187
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:23,177
I'm just admiring. I'm better now.

188
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,411
How's work?

189
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:25,579
It's great.

190
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:27,447
When I last spoke to them,

191
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:30,484
they believed you were a model employee.

192
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:34,321
They found you meticulous
and conscientious.

193
00:15:34,354 --> 00:15:36,156
- You know this, right?
- I do.

194
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,992
You've managed there for 10 years.

195
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:39,493
You're functioning very well, Barry.

196
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:44,231
And it's a rare and wonderful
place for you to work.

197
00:15:44,264 --> 00:15:45,966
Yes, it is.

198
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,069
You know, of all my other
clients with your disorder,

199
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:51,505
you've been the most
consistent at your job.

200
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:55,275
Did something happen, Barry?

201
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,411
How old are you?

202
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:02,116
Just... The Internet is
inconsistent on this point.

203
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:04,318
Why is that on your mind?

204
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,955
Who's gonna look after us
when you retire or pass on?

205
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:10,457
You know, we're gonna have
to take care of ourselves

206
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,492
and nobody even believes that we exist.

207
00:16:12,526 --> 00:16:15,362
If ever something were to happen to me,

208
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:18,465
I've made arrangements with a colleague
from Baltimore to take over.

209
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,935
Hmm.

210
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:22,102
Hey, do you, uh...

211
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:24,138
You live alone?

212
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:25,572
You know this.

213
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:27,341
I'm sorry, I just meant how long?

214
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:28,475
Always.

215
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:33,180
That must be so lonely.

216
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,157
Uh, you know what?

217
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,293
I'm doing much better. I shouldn't
have emailed you. I'm just...

218
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:48,128
Look at me. I'm too impulsive.

219
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:53,067
By the way,

220
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,069
is anybody listening?

221
00:16:55,102 --> 00:16:56,636
Does anybody care about us?

222
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,904
Yes.

223
00:16:57,938 --> 00:17:01,141
The University of Paris has asked
me to do a lecture, in fact.

224
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:04,344
I'm going to be doing it
via Skype from right here.

225
00:17:04,378 --> 00:17:07,047
People are believing more.

226
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:10,650
Let's meet at our usual time next week.

227
00:17:10,684 --> 00:17:12,987
I would rather you didn't leave, Barry.

228
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:16,991
Did something happen?

229
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:18,392
Don't worry.

230
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:19,559
This was just a visit.

231
00:17:19,593 --> 00:17:21,228
I'm doing much better, I actually...

232
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:23,730
Don't you want your sketches, Barry?

233
00:17:23,763 --> 00:17:26,066
You're usually very protective of them.

234
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:28,568
Yeah.

235
00:17:29,203 --> 00:17:30,204
Thanks.

236
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,410
I'll see you next week
at our usual time.

237
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:39,546
Thanks for fighting
for us, Dr. Fletcher.

238
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:53,660
Thanks, Dr. Fletcher.

239
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:55,429
Welcome.

240
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:56,430
I just think I'm gonna blow it.

241
00:17:56,463 --> 00:17:58,532
No, you'll be great.
I'll see you next week.

242
00:17:58,565 --> 00:17:59,533
Okay, thank you.

243
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:08,508
...DJ's exclusive million dollar

244
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:11,445
Holiday Bucks Bonanza.

245
00:18:11,478 --> 00:18:13,747
I don't know how you work
with those people.

246
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:16,216
What people?

247
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,152
Your patients.

248
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:23,090
You can't use your thumbs
to spin the wheel, dumbasses.

249
00:18:23,123 --> 00:18:25,292
They always use their thumbs. Oh.

250
00:18:28,362 --> 00:18:32,432
Well, we look at people who've been
shattered and different as less than.

251
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:34,701
What if

252
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:37,704
they're more than us?

253
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:39,606
What?

254
00:18:43,243 --> 00:18:45,312
Do you believe them?
Your patients.

255
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,248
Just between you and me.

256
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:49,583
- Yes, I do.
- Hmm.

257
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,487
Flick it! Flick it!

258
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,156
...coming up next, right after this.

259
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,757
I don't believe it.

260
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,094
- No offense.
- No.

261
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:01,561
...but when you call, we'll send you

262
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:03,163
a second easy-feet absolutely free!

263
00:19:03,197 --> 00:19:04,731
Just pay separate processing.

264
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:06,166
So that's two easy feet...

265
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,102
Now, that, I need to buy that.

266
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:13,307
He's back.

267
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,275
There's a lady outside.

268
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,421
Dennis, admit what you've done.

269
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:28,522
Don't get upset.

270
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:31,258
Don't tell me.

271
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:33,727
I'm getting frightened.

272
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,532
I thought that you had
this under control.

273
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:40,567
Please tell me it's not too late.

274
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,768
The food is waiting.

275
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:48,342
Is she in that room?

276
00:19:50,244 --> 00:19:51,745
- We're here!
- Help us!

277
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:53,213
We're in here!

278
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:54,614
What is this? How many are there?

279
00:19:54,648 --> 00:19:56,216
No, don't go in there!

280
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,384
Don't go in there!

281
00:20:06,726 --> 00:20:08,195
Don't worry.

282
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:12,332
I'll talk to him.

283
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,569
He listens to me.

284
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,479
He's not well.

285
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:28,815
He knows what you're here for.

286
00:20:28,848 --> 00:20:31,451
He's not allowed to touch you.

287
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:32,686
He knows that.

288
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:36,423
Mmm-mmm.

289
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:39,626
Hmm?

290
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:06,152
Karen. Joe.

291
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:09,256
They said you can't have your
own panel at the national conference.

292
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:13,360
They conceded, however,

293
00:21:13,393 --> 00:21:15,595
that you can be part of
the mood disorder panel.

294
00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:17,731
It's not a mood disorder.

295
00:21:17,764 --> 00:21:20,367
Oh, I'm aware of your beliefs, Karen.

296
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,537
Well, were they open this time
with the new evidence?

297
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,573
One of your arguments is a dog?

298
00:21:26,606 --> 00:21:28,942
You submitted video of
a dog acting differently

299
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:30,844
to one of your patients
at different times?

300
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:32,912
It is more dramatic than that.

301
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:35,782
They are what they believe they are.

302
00:21:35,815 --> 00:21:38,785
The brain has learned to defend itself.

303
00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:40,787
You speak of them like
they're supernaturally gifted.

304
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:43,457
Like they have powers or something.

305
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,392
Karen, these are patients.

306
00:21:45,425 --> 00:21:47,294
They have been through trauma.

307
00:21:50,297 --> 00:21:54,334
And perhaps now they are
capable of something we're not.

308
00:21:56,002 --> 00:21:59,273
We have brain scans now.

309
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:03,843
DID patients have changed their
body chemistry with their thoughts.

310
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:09,649
He's just trying to scare us.

311
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:11,985
He was having a full
conversation with himself.

312
00:22:14,454 --> 00:22:17,724
What was that line about?
"The food is waiting."

313
00:22:17,757 --> 00:22:19,759
Does everyone get how wacked this is

314
00:22:19,793 --> 00:22:21,828
and that we need to get out of here now?

315
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,639
No.

316
00:22:32,672 --> 00:22:35,275
Please, keep your area neat.

317
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:36,976
The bathroom, it's unacceptable.

318
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,513
To make it easy, I've color-coded these.

319
00:22:39,546 --> 00:22:41,948
Use the blue bottle for the floor

320
00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:44,784
and the pink bottle
for the ceramic surfaces.

321
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:50,724
Uh...

322
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:14,548
Patricia has reminded me that
I was sent to get you for a reason.

323
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:17,384
That you are sacred food.

324
00:23:19,085 --> 00:23:21,521
And I promise not to bother you again.

325
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:37,537
Maybe he has a dog or something.

326
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:39,739
You think he's gonna
feed us to his dogs?

327
00:24:13,873 --> 00:24:14,874
Casey.

328
00:24:16,843 --> 00:24:17,844
Casey!

329
00:24:36,563 --> 00:24:38,064
My name's Hedwig.

330
00:24:38,097 --> 00:24:39,866
I have red socks.

331
00:24:46,573 --> 00:24:48,608
He's on the move.

332
00:24:51,578 --> 00:24:52,579
What?

333
00:24:56,516 --> 00:24:57,116
He's...

334
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:58,952
on...

335
00:24:58,985 --> 00:25:00,454
the...

336
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:01,921
move.

337
00:25:04,223 --> 00:25:05,091
Who?

338
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,495
Someone's coming for you

339
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:11,465
and you're not gonna like it.

340
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:13,533
You guys make noises in your sleep.

341
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:14,568
Tell us.

342
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:17,571
I'm not supposed to say.

343
00:25:18,872 --> 00:25:21,808
But he's done awful things to people

344
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:23,610
and he'll do awful things to you.

345
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:25,111
I have blue socks, too.

346
00:25:25,144 --> 00:25:26,680
We're his food?

347
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,852
How old are you?

348
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:34,754
Nine.

349
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,927
So you're not the guy that took us?

350
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:42,962
No.

351
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:46,800
You're not the lady?

352
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:49,135
What are you, blind?

353
00:25:49,168 --> 00:25:52,071
You don't know how they think?

354
00:25:52,105 --> 00:25:54,641
No, they don't tell me much.

355
00:25:54,674 --> 00:25:56,109
I just ate a hot dog.

356
00:25:57,711 --> 00:26:00,847
Could you help us, Hedwig?

357
00:26:02,582 --> 00:26:05,685
No, I'm not even supposed to be here.

358
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:08,755
I stole the light from Mr. Dennis,
but he'll be back real soon.

359
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:12,926
I can't steal the light for too
long or he'll know and get angry.

360
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:14,127
Etcetera.

361
00:26:16,796 --> 00:26:17,931
See you!

362
00:26:17,964 --> 00:26:19,065
Wait.

363
00:26:22,802 --> 00:26:24,571
We heard something.

364
00:26:26,706 --> 00:26:29,142
We didn't understand it,

365
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,145
but now we do.

366
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:37,551
Do you know what we heard?

367
00:26:37,584 --> 00:26:39,185
What did you hear?

368
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,921
Come here.

369
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,925
I'll whisper it to you.

370
00:26:48,194 --> 00:26:49,195
Okay.

371
00:27:01,908 --> 00:27:03,042
This guy

372
00:27:06,746 --> 00:27:08,715
is coming for you.

373
00:27:13,787 --> 00:27:15,254
You're a big fibber.

374
00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:16,890
I never lie, Hedwig.

375
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:20,660
But Mr. Dennis,

376
00:27:20,694 --> 00:27:23,730
he said that he followed
those two girls for four days

377
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:25,932
and that he knew

378
00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:28,568
that they were the ones
that he would want.

379
00:27:31,337 --> 00:27:33,640
When you're not around,

380
00:27:33,673 --> 00:27:35,942
Dennis and the lady talk about it.

381
00:27:35,975 --> 00:27:38,912
They talk about how
he wants a boy this time.

382
00:27:38,945 --> 00:27:40,346
They're going to give him you.

383
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:43,249
No, Miss Patricia, she said...

384
00:27:43,282 --> 00:27:45,351
She said she's not mad at me anymore.

385
00:27:45,384 --> 00:27:47,621
She sings to me sometimes.

386
00:27:47,654 --> 00:27:50,556
I think Miss Patricia is
still a little mad at you.

387
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:54,027
Miss Patricia thinks I'm...

388
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,629
She thinks I'm stupid.

389
00:27:57,063 --> 00:27:59,065
She thinks I make silly mistakes.

390
00:27:59,933 --> 00:28:01,034
Look at me.

391
00:28:01,935 --> 00:28:04,137
We're like your babysitters.

392
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,975
We'll let you watch TV
and make you a fun dinner.

393
00:28:11,144 --> 00:28:13,980
We all need to get out of here.

394
00:28:14,013 --> 00:28:16,382
You could show us the way out.

395
00:28:16,415 --> 00:28:18,985
We could be gone
before anybody gets back,

396
00:28:19,018 --> 00:28:21,120
but we have to hurry, Hedwig.

397
00:28:21,154 --> 00:28:23,623
We have to hurry and get out of here.

398
00:28:27,026 --> 00:28:28,261
Wait a minute.

399
00:28:29,896 --> 00:28:31,965
It took forever to get this place safe

400
00:28:31,998 --> 00:28:33,933
without the nosey bodies
that work here finding out.

401
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:35,869
You can't get out of here!

402
00:28:35,902 --> 00:28:37,036
I have to blow my nose.

403
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,237
No, wait! Please don't go!

404
00:28:40,974 --> 00:28:41,941
Who's coming?

405
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:45,144
This is seriously scary.

406
00:28:45,178 --> 00:28:46,312
No one's coming.

407
00:28:50,984 --> 00:28:52,618
He said something.

408
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:58,324
He said something
about making the room safe.

409
00:28:59,392 --> 00:29:00,994
This is all new drywall.

410
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:04,130
What was unsafe?

411
00:29:39,098 --> 00:29:40,133
Wait.

412
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:42,869
Wait, are we sure about this?

413
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,193
Casey, you were right.

414
00:30:08,061 --> 00:30:09,829
There's something here.

415
00:30:09,863 --> 00:30:11,898
He was covering up a way out.

416
00:30:11,931 --> 00:30:13,332
Tell me if you see him.

417
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,038
Casey, tell us what you see.

418
00:30:26,345 --> 00:30:28,281
He's here.

419
00:30:28,314 --> 00:30:30,049
You can't let him in!
You can't let him in!

420
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,217
This is our one chance.

421
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,054
We're not gonna make it.

422
00:30:35,088 --> 00:30:36,255
Yes, we are!

423
00:30:44,931 --> 00:30:45,932
What?

424
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:48,234
Hey, what are you guys doing?

425
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:53,372
Hey.

426
00:30:54,874 --> 00:30:56,375
Okay, quit it.

427
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,244
Okay, guys?

428
00:30:58,912 --> 00:31:00,079
Let me in.

429
00:31:00,113 --> 00:31:03,182
Give us a second. We're changing.

430
00:31:03,216 --> 00:31:04,417
What are you guys doing?

431
00:31:06,452 --> 00:31:07,420
Let me in.

432
00:31:10,189 --> 00:31:11,791
Guys, you're not being funny.

433
00:31:22,902 --> 00:31:25,138
You're being bitches!
Now, I'm gonna slap you!

434
00:31:25,171 --> 00:31:26,272
I'm gonna slap you in your face.

435
00:31:26,305 --> 00:31:28,074
Just give me as much time as you can.

436
00:31:29,575 --> 00:31:31,878
You're gonna get me into trouble.

437
00:31:35,481 --> 00:31:36,816
Guys...

438
00:31:38,584 --> 00:31:40,053
All right, push up.

439
00:32:46,285 --> 00:32:47,286
Hey!

440
00:32:52,258 --> 00:32:53,426
Hey!

441
00:32:59,665 --> 00:33:01,267
Hey!

442
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

443
00:33:27,026 --> 00:33:29,328
I thought I lost you.

444
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:33,666
Would you, uh...

445
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:36,902
Would you step outside, please?

446
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:46,379
You like to make fun of us.

447
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:49,048
But we're more powerful than you think.

448
00:33:49,082 --> 00:33:50,583
Step outside.

449
00:33:53,352 --> 00:33:54,353
Please.

450
00:34:03,229 --> 00:34:05,331
You shouldn't trick children.

451
00:34:06,265 --> 00:34:08,334
That shows who you are.

452
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,509
Look at your sweater. It's ruined.

453
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:18,044
It's dirty.

454
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:21,514
Remove it.

455
00:34:53,212 --> 00:34:54,513
I'm trying to be good.

456
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,266
You will not see your friend again.

457
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:17,403
She will be kept separate.

458
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:23,142
You take off your skirt.
You take off your shirt.

459
00:35:23,176 --> 00:35:25,144
Clothes you got all dirty from the dust.

460
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:54,607
One identity in an individual with
Dissociative Identity Disorder

461
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,841
can have high cholesterol.

462
00:35:55,874 --> 00:35:57,276
One.

463
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:01,280
There have been cases where one
identity is allergic to bee stings.

464
00:36:01,314 --> 00:36:03,048
The others are not.

465
00:36:03,082 --> 00:36:07,786
Are there moments where two identities
can coexist at the same time?

466
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,589
There are times when two identities

467
00:36:10,623 --> 00:36:14,160
can take the "light" or "the spot"

468
00:36:14,193 --> 00:36:16,762
or consciousness at the same time.

469
00:36:16,795 --> 00:36:19,732
This happened with a student
that I was working with.

470
00:36:19,765 --> 00:36:23,836
And her left and right hand
were taking notes

471
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:28,841
in different hand-writings about
separate things at the same time.

472
00:36:28,874 --> 00:36:32,645
The differences in the
identities can be dramatic.

473
00:36:32,678 --> 00:36:36,482
As much as the difference
between you and me

474
00:36:36,515 --> 00:36:39,418
and every person in that auditorium.

475
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,588
The identities have different IQ’s.

476
00:36:42,621 --> 00:36:44,623
They have different physical strengths.

477
00:36:44,657 --> 00:36:47,860
One personality is
a Russian weightlifter

478
00:36:47,893 --> 00:36:51,764
and can lift three times
his body weight.

479
00:36:51,797 --> 00:36:54,667
Their ability to hyper-focus

480
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,803
and have different
experiences is astounding.

481
00:37:00,706 --> 00:37:05,211
Have these individuals,
through their suffering,

482
00:37:05,244 --> 00:37:08,181
unlocked the potential of the brain?

483
00:37:09,715 --> 00:37:13,219
Is this the ultimate doorway

484
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,790
to all things we call unknown?

485
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:24,663
Is this where our sense of
the supernatural comes from?

486
00:37:38,411 --> 00:37:40,379
It's about depth

487
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:44,317
and curves...

488
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,818
Hey, you see that one?

489
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:47,686
It's kind of like
a chenille sweater-dress.

490
00:37:51,924 --> 00:37:53,326
Who are you?

491
00:37:58,331 --> 00:37:59,532
Barry.

492
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:02,701
I don't think you are.

493
00:38:04,603 --> 00:38:07,373
I've developed a nose for sensing

494
00:38:07,406 --> 00:38:09,408
whom I'm talking to and whom I'm not.

495
00:38:10,743 --> 00:38:12,611
Have I done something?

496
00:38:12,645 --> 00:38:15,448
You've emailed for
an unscheduled appointment

497
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:17,583
two days in a row.

498
00:38:17,616 --> 00:38:19,452
We're just feeling overwhelmed.

499
00:38:20,253 --> 00:38:21,687
Garden-variety issues.

500
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:27,926
I think Orwell or Jade
or Samuel or Heinrich

501
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,763
had the light for a moment
and emailed me.

502
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:33,332
And you're here to
tell me everything's okay.

503
00:38:33,366 --> 00:38:34,900
I emailed you.

504
00:38:37,503 --> 00:38:39,572
May I talk to one of them, please?

505
00:38:44,277 --> 00:38:45,978
That can't happen.

506
00:38:46,011 --> 00:38:47,546
I...

507
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,515
I told them that I wanted to

508
00:38:49,548 --> 00:38:51,284
spend the session with you today.

509
00:38:52,718 --> 00:38:55,654
I'm gonna ask again.

510
00:38:55,688 --> 00:38:59,492
To whom am I speaking with now?

511
00:38:59,525 --> 00:39:02,261
Dr. Fletcher, it's Barry.

512
00:39:02,995 --> 00:39:05,731
It doesn't seem like Barry.

513
00:39:05,764 --> 00:39:08,000
Barry is an extroverted leader.

514
00:39:08,033 --> 00:39:09,402
Yes, I am.

515
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:14,273
I'm gonna take a professional guess

516
00:39:14,307 --> 00:39:18,010
based on the description
of all 23 identities

517
00:39:18,043 --> 00:39:20,546
that live in Kevin's body,

518
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,648
that I've gotten from Barry.

519
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:28,587
I think I'm talking to Dennis.

520
00:39:31,924 --> 00:39:33,759
But he's been banned from the light

521
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:36,429
because, among other reasons,

522
00:39:36,462 --> 00:39:40,833
he has a proclivity to watch
young girls dance naked,

523
00:39:40,866 --> 00:39:42,768
which he himself knows is wrong

524
00:39:42,801 --> 00:39:45,604
and has fought against
with little success.

525
00:39:45,638 --> 00:39:48,441
I'm encouraged we can finally meet.

526
00:39:48,474 --> 00:39:49,942
And I've guessed this

527
00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:53,712
because you've adjusted the chocolate
dish twice since you came in here

528
00:39:53,746 --> 00:39:55,381
and I understand you have OCD.

529
00:39:56,782 --> 00:39:59,318
I see. Now, I see. That's clever.

530
00:39:59,352 --> 00:40:01,454
That's clever, but I'm not Dennis.

531
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:04,557
And you and Patricia have
been banned from the light

532
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,492
for quite a while now.

533
00:40:06,525 --> 00:40:08,827
Primarily, shall we say,
because of your beliefs.

534
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:11,364
Patricia and Dennis are very unstable.

535
00:40:11,397 --> 00:40:12,698
I'm not Dennis.

536
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:14,933
Have you both taken charge now?

537
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:17,536
Please believe me, I'm Barry.

538
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,044
You must forgive me.

539
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:29,382
My job is to challenge you.

540
00:40:29,415 --> 00:40:31,684
And, as you must know by now,

541
00:40:31,717 --> 00:40:33,686
I have plenty of opinions about

542
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:35,388
how everyone should live their lives.

543
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:39,625
Ask me something about fashion.

544
00:40:39,658 --> 00:40:40,926
I'll prove it.

545
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,562
Look, look, look. Lindt.

546
00:40:46,064 --> 00:40:47,032
Yeah, look.

547
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:51,003
You see? I'm not Dennis.

548
00:40:52,638 --> 00:40:54,507
You want me to do something else?

549
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,908
You got ice cream?

550
00:40:55,941 --> 00:40:58,043
Oh, this shirt's a cotton blend anyway

551
00:40:58,076 --> 00:41:00,413
and the collar is from
three seasons ago.

552
00:41:00,446 --> 00:41:02,381
Snood? I mean, come on.

553
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,902
Jai, what health-conscious
fast food purveyor

554
00:41:23,936 --> 00:41:26,138
did you originally solicit
to buy these chicken wings

555
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:29,575
you've so lovingly reheated
in a minor suicidal gesture?

556
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:31,610
Hooters. And you can't just
throw them out, Dr. Fletcher.

557
00:41:31,644 --> 00:41:33,746
Oh, this is wrong on so many levels.

558
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:38,083
We finished about 3:15,
so look around 3:18.

559
00:41:38,116 --> 00:41:39,593
You're getting a little soft
around the middle, Jai.

560
00:41:39,594 --> 00:41:40,085
Mmm-hmm.

561
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,923
The authors of Hooters play
on our incessant need for fat

562
00:41:44,957 --> 00:41:48,894
and man's incessant need to be in
the proximity of augmented breasts.

563
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:52,565
It's like Henry V ran
a fast food franchise.

564
00:41:52,598 --> 00:41:53,732
It's a good place, Dr. Fletcher.

565
00:41:53,766 --> 00:41:55,000
Right.

566
00:41:56,602 --> 00:41:58,604
How'd you know
the trash would be spilled?

567
00:41:58,637 --> 00:42:00,038
How can I say this, Jai?

568
00:42:00,072 --> 00:42:02,641
You're not the most
meticulous of people.

569
00:42:19,658 --> 00:42:20,826
This guy isn't very neat, is he?

570
00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:21,827
He walked right through the trash.

571
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,161
No, Jai.

572
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:25,564
Any normal person
would have walked around it.

573
00:42:25,598 --> 00:42:27,666
That was an act.

574
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:31,036
What are you up to, Dennis?

575
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:35,941
Or is it Patricia who's deciding things?

576
00:42:38,544 --> 00:42:39,945
We're not gonna die.

577
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:42,981
Bad things happen.

578
00:42:44,182 --> 00:42:46,018
But not like this.

579
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,120
Casey...

580
00:42:49,722 --> 00:42:51,023
Talk to me.

581
00:42:53,892 --> 00:42:56,929
We need to get to a window
or a door, or something.

582
00:42:56,962 --> 00:42:58,130
Don't you think?

583
00:43:13,245 --> 00:43:16,615
The thrill, Casey,
is about whether you can

584
00:43:16,649 --> 00:43:19,718
or can't outsmart this animal.

585
00:43:23,155 --> 00:43:25,824
See, you didn't used to
like to come out here.

586
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:27,993
This is like our
family tradition, right?

587
00:43:29,562 --> 00:43:30,729
Good shot, big brother.

588
00:43:31,597 --> 00:43:32,931
Thank you, John.

589
00:43:40,706 --> 00:43:42,875
I have your meal, sleepyhead.

590
00:43:47,946 --> 00:43:49,114
Eat.

591
00:43:56,088 --> 00:43:57,155
It's good?

592
00:43:58,757 --> 00:44:00,959
It's got paprika in it.

593
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:06,131
I'm sorry.

594
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,737
I think I'll put a pretty
flower in your hair.

595
00:44:14,206 --> 00:44:15,207
There we are.

596
00:44:23,015 --> 00:44:25,083
That's to show how important you are.

597
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:27,285
Come along.

598
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:29,154
We'll have a proper meal.

599
00:44:32,991 --> 00:44:34,259
I understand.

600
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:36,962
This must all seem
so unsatisfactory for you.

601
00:44:36,995 --> 00:44:39,965
But we are doing the best we can.

602
00:44:59,351 --> 00:45:00,318
Good?

603
00:45:03,656 --> 00:45:04,757
Hmm?

604
00:45:07,325 --> 00:45:09,061
Can Claire come eat with us?

605
00:45:09,094 --> 00:45:11,063
No.

606
00:45:11,096 --> 00:45:13,732
No, I'm afraid that can't happen.

607
00:45:13,766 --> 00:45:17,169
She almost ruined our big reception.

608
00:45:18,704 --> 00:45:19,872
Mmm...

609
00:45:23,876 --> 00:45:26,945
I've heard that Asian people's
music aids digestion.

610
00:45:29,081 --> 00:45:31,183
I'll make you a second sandwich.

611
00:45:35,721 --> 00:45:37,790
Do you know,

612
00:45:37,823 --> 00:45:42,360
a family of lions can eat
35 pounds a day?

613
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:49,367
A buck can lose 30% of its
weight during mating season,

614
00:45:49,401 --> 00:45:51,069
chasing does around.

615
00:45:51,103 --> 00:45:52,738
They're crepuscular, right?

616
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:57,209
It means they travel around
during dusk and dawn.

617
00:45:57,242 --> 00:45:58,243
Good for you.

618
00:46:14,827 --> 00:46:16,161
It's crooked.

619
00:46:17,462 --> 00:46:18,831
Forgive me.

620
00:46:29,141 --> 00:46:33,278
I don't know if you know,
but tigers have only 30 teeth.

621
00:46:35,413 --> 00:46:38,951
That's 12 less than a dog.

622
00:46:38,984 --> 00:46:40,786
I thought that was a fun fact.

623
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:42,320
No.

624
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,360
Marcia.

625
00:46:48,961 --> 00:46:50,362
Marcia, listen to me.

626
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,789
Go to your room. Shut the door.

627
00:47:16,822 --> 00:47:17,722
Do it now.

628
00:47:52,925 --> 00:47:57,195
"In the sun, we will find our passion.

629
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:03,068
"In the sun, we will find our purpose."

630
00:48:09,274 --> 00:48:11,343
You've always been protected.

631
00:48:11,376 --> 00:48:13,846
You've never truly suffered.

632
00:48:13,879 --> 00:48:16,949
And that's why we chose you.

633
00:48:16,982 --> 00:48:18,783
You've always been asleep.

634
00:48:22,387 --> 00:48:24,456
You never had a chance.

635
00:48:29,261 --> 00:48:31,229
You never had a chance.

636
00:48:32,998 --> 00:48:36,368
The dark-haired girl,
she's gonna be kept in another closet.

637
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:37,335
You might as well know at this point.

638
00:48:38,436 --> 00:48:40,238
The Beast,

639
00:48:40,272 --> 00:48:43,075
he's coming for you.

640
00:48:43,108 --> 00:48:45,510
All three of you, you're
gonna be kept separate.

641
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:49,281
You've got...

642
00:48:49,314 --> 00:48:51,249
You've got a crumb on your shirt.

643
00:48:53,618 --> 00:48:55,087
Please take it off.

644
00:48:55,587 --> 00:48:56,388
Just...

645
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,025
Just take it off.

646
00:49:16,574 --> 00:49:17,375
Hey.

647
00:49:23,615 --> 00:49:26,118
Ah.

648
00:49:51,276 --> 00:49:53,645
It wasn't nice, what you
said about Miss Patricia.

649
00:49:54,947 --> 00:49:56,248
You lied.

650
00:50:00,986 --> 00:50:03,922
I'm sorry about that, Hedwig.

651
00:50:03,956 --> 00:50:08,126
You guys lied to me,
made me scared, etcetera.

652
00:50:11,629 --> 00:50:14,967
Mr. Dennis, he says
you wear a lot of shirts.

653
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,168
I like this shirt.

654
00:50:17,102 --> 00:50:18,670
Thank you.

655
00:50:18,703 --> 00:50:21,306
Do you know who Dennis
and Miss Patricia are?

656
00:50:21,339 --> 00:50:22,640
No.

657
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:29,281
Every one of us has to wait in a chair,

658
00:50:29,314 --> 00:50:33,618
and Barry, he decides
who stands in the light.

659
00:50:33,651 --> 00:50:36,321
But Barry lost that power because of me.

660
00:50:38,256 --> 00:50:41,526
I can wish myself into
the light anytime I want.

661
00:50:42,327 --> 00:50:45,998
It's a special power.

662
00:50:46,031 --> 00:50:49,234
Barry just has to keep sitting
in his chair if I want him to.

663
00:50:51,103 --> 00:50:54,039
That's why Dennis and Miss Patricia
said I could be with them.

664
00:50:55,407 --> 00:50:58,977
Dennis and Miss Patricia,
they believe in The Beast

665
00:50:59,011 --> 00:51:00,545
and what he can do.

666
00:51:02,047 --> 00:51:04,382
Have you seen him?

667
00:51:08,086 --> 00:51:09,387
The Beast?

668
00:51:11,023 --> 00:51:12,557
No. Can I kiss you?

669
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:16,161
I wanted to kiss the other
girl with the dark hair,

670
00:51:16,194 --> 00:51:17,562
but she's in trouble.

671
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:23,201
So, do you want to?

672
00:51:23,235 --> 00:51:24,636
I mean, I don't know
much about kissing, though.

673
00:51:24,669 --> 00:51:25,470
Yeah.

674
00:51:29,174 --> 00:51:30,508
Okay.

675
00:51:31,276 --> 00:51:33,111
Uh...

676
00:51:33,145 --> 00:51:34,479
Okay, here we go.

677
00:51:37,115 --> 00:51:38,216
One...

678
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:39,251
Two...

679
00:51:40,285 --> 00:51:41,286
Three.

680
00:51:56,768 --> 00:51:58,403
You might be pregnant now.

681
00:52:01,106 --> 00:52:02,440
Am I a good kisser?

682
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:04,542
Yeah.

683
00:52:05,143 --> 00:52:06,278
I like dancing.

684
00:52:06,311 --> 00:52:08,413
Do you like dancing?

685
00:52:08,446 --> 00:52:12,284
I like dancing to
my CD player in my room.

686
00:52:12,317 --> 00:52:14,119
Kanye West is my main man.

687
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,223
We got my CD player set up in my room,

688
00:52:18,256 --> 00:52:19,591
right next to my window.

689
00:52:20,392 --> 00:52:21,393
I'm like...

690
00:52:28,533 --> 00:52:29,534
We gots the moves.

691
00:52:29,834 --> 00:52:30,635
Wow.

692
00:52:33,271 --> 00:52:36,541
Maybe I could watch you dance

693
00:52:36,574 --> 00:52:39,244
and listen to music with you.

694
00:52:40,512 --> 00:52:42,580
No, my music's in my room.

695
00:52:43,148 --> 00:52:44,616
Oh. Right.

696
00:52:47,352 --> 00:52:48,353
Maybe

697
00:52:49,487 --> 00:52:50,788
you could sneak me there.

698
00:52:52,457 --> 00:52:54,392
Are you trying to trick me?

699
00:52:55,127 --> 00:52:56,494
Etcetera?

700
00:52:57,629 --> 00:52:59,497
I'll tell on you.

701
00:52:59,531 --> 00:53:01,099
I'm telling on you.

702
00:53:01,133 --> 00:53:03,268
I'll tell you something.

703
00:53:03,301 --> 00:53:05,503
And you can tell me
if I'm lying or not, okay?

704
00:53:05,537 --> 00:53:07,439
- Mmm-hmm.
- Like a test. Okay?

705
00:53:12,877 --> 00:53:17,682
I get into trouble
at school, on purpose.

706
00:53:22,154 --> 00:53:24,456
So I can get sent to detention.

707
00:53:29,227 --> 00:53:32,664
To get away from everyone.

708
00:53:39,371 --> 00:53:41,206
So that I can be alone.

709
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,653
Okay, I'll show you
something cool in my room.

710
00:53:56,754 --> 00:53:58,022
Okay.

711
00:53:58,055 --> 00:54:01,459
But after Mr. Dennis has finished
his getting-ready ritual.

712
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,561
I have to go.

713
00:54:03,595 --> 00:54:05,363
He's got an appointment.

714
00:54:05,397 --> 00:54:06,631
When I fall asleep,

715
00:54:06,664 --> 00:54:08,266
one of the others keeps trying
to reach the doctor lady

716
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,168
to tell on us.

717
00:54:10,202 --> 00:54:12,570
That pant, it's got a red lining.

718
00:54:12,604 --> 00:54:15,940
You can see it in
the long slit down the side.

719
00:54:15,973 --> 00:54:20,612
We have been talking about
silk-and-wool blend for 20 minutes.

720
00:54:20,645 --> 00:54:23,615
Can I guess that you emailed
me in the middle of the night

721
00:54:23,648 --> 00:54:28,886
for an emergency session
due to garden-variety issues?

722
00:54:31,456 --> 00:54:35,960
I was down and I emailed you and
I woke up and I feel better.

723
00:54:35,993 --> 00:54:37,729
I feel better.

724
00:54:39,931 --> 00:54:41,566
I had a thought.

725
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:42,867
Mmm-mmm.

726
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,670
I want to talk about
the incident at work.

727
00:54:45,703 --> 00:54:47,372
It's okay, Barry.

728
00:54:47,405 --> 00:54:49,241
You're safe.

729
00:54:49,274 --> 00:54:51,676
I just want to bring the details back.

730
00:54:51,709 --> 00:54:53,745
We'll just talk about the details.

731
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,583
A high school from Camden, New Jersey

732
00:54:58,616 --> 00:55:01,753
was on a field trip
at your place of work

733
00:55:01,786 --> 00:55:04,389
and two young ladies came up to you.

734
00:55:04,422 --> 00:55:07,325
And one took your hand

735
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,261
and put it under her shirt on her breast

736
00:55:09,294 --> 00:55:10,628
and the second one did the same

737
00:55:10,662 --> 00:55:13,731
and then they just ran off
laughing to their friends.

738
00:55:13,765 --> 00:55:16,468
You surmised that it might be on a dare.

739
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:18,903
You said they were 17 or 18.

740
00:55:18,936 --> 00:55:20,938
You said it upset you for days.

741
00:55:20,972 --> 00:55:23,975
It was just a teenage prank.
I get that now.

742
00:55:25,377 --> 00:55:28,380
And see, that's my mistake.

743
00:55:28,413 --> 00:55:32,784
I believe that I went over this
incident with you too fast.

744
00:55:32,817 --> 00:55:35,653
Although you said you were fine,

745
00:55:35,687 --> 00:55:39,791
and the other identities
I met with said it was fine,

746
00:55:39,824 --> 00:55:44,028
I believe that this brought up issues

747
00:55:44,061 --> 00:55:46,964
from when you were a child and abused.

748
00:55:46,998 --> 00:55:49,967
Sometimes another incident of abuse

749
00:55:50,001 --> 00:55:52,704
can cause suppressed
personalities to take the light.

750
00:55:53,505 --> 00:55:56,508
Dennis, if this is you,

751
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:58,910
I completely understand

752
00:55:58,943 --> 00:56:02,947
why you felt the need to take
over and protect the others.

753
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,316
Please!

754
00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:05,850
Doctor, not this again.

755
00:56:05,883 --> 00:56:07,084
The others told me

756
00:56:07,118 --> 00:56:11,623
that you and Patricia told
the group about this Beast.

757
00:56:11,656 --> 00:56:15,026
And I told them that these
are just scary stories

758
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:19,564
that Dennis and Patricia tell
the others to scare them.

759
00:56:19,597 --> 00:56:22,367
How this Beast can crawl on walls,

760
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,738
like the best rock climbers using
the slightest friction and imperfections

761
00:56:26,771 --> 00:56:31,543
to hold his body close
to seemingly sheer surfaces.

762
00:56:31,576 --> 00:56:35,780
How his skin is thick and tough
like the hide of a rhinoceros.

763
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:42,687
Do you really believe
the stories about The Beast?

764
00:56:44,389 --> 00:56:45,457
Hmm.

765
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,659
If this is you, Dennis,

766
00:56:48,893 --> 00:56:51,496
I understand why Kevin needs you.

767
00:56:53,365 --> 00:56:55,833
You are strong and disciplined.

768
00:56:55,867 --> 00:56:57,735
You are precise

769
00:56:57,769 --> 00:56:59,971
and you will not be taken advantage of.

770
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:03,741
You can trust me.

771
00:57:05,577 --> 00:57:07,011
For example,

772
00:57:07,044 --> 00:57:11,549
I do have the ability to use Kevin's
full name and bring him forward

773
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:12,850
as he has in the past.

774
00:57:13,951 --> 00:57:16,521
But I wouldn't do that.

775
00:57:16,554 --> 00:57:20,758
I know that that would
be chaos for all of you.

776
00:57:20,792 --> 00:57:22,760
Everyone would grab the light.

777
00:57:22,794 --> 00:57:24,896
I don't want to hurt
any of you that way.

778
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:28,600
You don't have to hide.

779
00:57:29,967 --> 00:57:32,870
I know you are someone
who cares for Kevin.

780
00:57:35,607 --> 00:57:38,910
You are not evil to me.

781
00:57:41,446 --> 00:57:43,648
You were necessary.

782
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:47,018
Dennis.

783
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,021
Is that you?

784
00:58:05,169 --> 00:58:07,038
They keep calling us The Horde.

785
00:58:09,741 --> 00:58:11,108
The others, you know?

786
00:58:13,044 --> 00:58:16,147
Miss Patricia and I, we are ridiculed.

787
00:58:17,949 --> 00:58:22,086
Now, we're not perfect, but we
don't deserve to be ridiculed.

788
00:58:24,021 --> 00:58:26,958
We're all struggling.
They have to admit that.

789
00:58:32,564 --> 00:58:34,899
I am pleased to meet you, Dennis.

790
00:58:37,101 --> 00:58:37,902
You, too.

791
00:58:41,606 --> 00:58:45,977
I assume you don't know who emailed
me for the emergency sessions?

792
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,512
One of the others.

793
00:58:49,113 --> 00:58:50,448
Are you in charge?

794
00:58:50,482 --> 00:58:52,650
Yeah, we've taken charge.

795
00:58:52,684 --> 00:58:54,919
We're the only ones
that can protect Kevin.

796
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:56,954
We're all here to protect Kevin.

797
00:58:57,722 --> 00:58:59,023
He's very weak.

798
00:59:01,993 --> 00:59:05,129
He doesn't know how powerful we can be.

799
00:59:05,162 --> 00:59:07,832
Would you mind telling me when
you first came into existence?

800
00:59:11,903 --> 00:59:15,607
And how you and Patricia,
the other undesirable identity,

801
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,974
became aligned?

802
00:59:20,578 --> 00:59:21,178
That's okay.

803
00:59:22,246 --> 00:59:24,048
Do you still have strong beliefs?

804
00:59:25,049 --> 00:59:26,951
That depends on what.

805
00:59:26,984 --> 00:59:30,221
This story of The Beast.

806
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:39,997
One thing, Dennis, that may
comfort you if you are confused

807
00:59:40,031 --> 00:59:43,935
is that you've met the other alters.

808
00:59:43,968 --> 00:59:46,604
You're all in a room in chairs, right?

809
00:59:47,539 --> 00:59:49,006
Yeah.

810
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,108
But you never met The Beast.

811
00:59:51,142 --> 00:59:53,711
Because he doesn't reside
with the rest of you.

812
00:59:53,745 --> 00:59:56,948
Because he resides in the
train yard, as the story goes,

813
00:59:56,981 --> 00:59:59,150
because Kevin's dad left on a train.

814
00:59:59,183 --> 01:00:01,519
But the fact is,

815
01:00:01,553 --> 01:00:04,088
you and Patricia have
never met The Beast.

816
01:00:04,722 --> 01:00:05,723
Have you?

817
01:00:07,124 --> 01:00:08,025
No.

818
01:00:09,193 --> 01:00:11,162
That's because he's not an alter.

819
01:00:12,597 --> 01:00:14,799
He's not the 24th identity.

820
01:00:16,734 --> 01:00:18,035
He's a fantasy.

821
01:00:37,755 --> 01:00:40,057
Hurry up! Let's go!

822
01:00:40,091 --> 01:00:41,826
Come on, it's time.

823
01:02:08,345 --> 01:02:09,180
Wow.

824
01:02:10,014 --> 01:02:11,182
I know.

825
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:14,719
This is your CD player?

826
01:02:14,752 --> 01:02:15,920
Yeah.

827
01:02:19,256 --> 01:02:20,624
You don't like it?

828
01:02:22,226 --> 01:02:23,327
- It's not new...
- No!

829
01:02:24,261 --> 01:02:25,897
No, I'm just, uh...

830
01:02:28,099 --> 01:02:30,267
I'm confused.

831
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:31,936
You said it was near a window.

832
01:02:31,969 --> 01:02:33,270
Oh, that's here!

833
01:02:35,272 --> 01:02:36,808
Watch.

834
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:37,975
Now, it's closed.

835
01:02:39,243 --> 01:02:40,344
Now, it's open.

836
01:02:41,913 --> 01:02:42,914
Now, it's closed.

837
01:02:44,782 --> 01:02:45,917
Now, it's open.

838
01:02:55,159 --> 01:02:57,394
Did you think it was a real window?

839
01:03:00,865 --> 01:03:03,835
So you could leave, etcetera?

840
01:03:06,337 --> 01:03:09,406
Help me get out of here, Hedwig.

841
01:03:11,308 --> 01:03:14,445
Just get me the keys
and let me out the door.

842
01:03:15,346 --> 01:03:16,580
Please.

843
01:03:16,613 --> 01:03:18,983
Miss Patricia says that nobody
will make fun of me anymore

844
01:03:19,016 --> 01:03:21,085
when The Beast comes!

845
01:03:21,118 --> 01:03:23,788
She says that everyone
will see how amazing I am

846
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:26,991
and then all of the silly mistakes,
they won't matter anymore.

847
01:03:27,024 --> 01:03:28,993
I think you should go
back to your room. No!

848
01:03:29,026 --> 01:03:30,294
Wait, please,

849
01:03:30,327 --> 01:03:31,796
I wanna hear your Kanye West albums.

850
01:03:31,829 --> 01:03:33,264
Show me your room.

851
01:03:33,297 --> 01:03:35,432
Let's stay here.
I'm sorry I asked to leave.

852
01:03:35,466 --> 01:03:37,101
I can't.

853
01:03:37,134 --> 01:03:38,502
You said you wanted to show
me something cool, right?

854
01:03:38,535 --> 01:03:39,436
No.

855
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:41,873
- Show me something. Please!
- I don't want to.

856
01:03:45,042 --> 01:03:46,043
This!

857
01:03:53,818 --> 01:03:55,286
Wow.

858
01:03:56,353 --> 01:03:57,721
It's nice.

859
01:03:58,289 --> 01:04:00,291
It's not a toy.

860
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:07,031
This is real?

861
01:04:07,064 --> 01:04:08,065
Yes!

862
01:04:10,167 --> 01:04:11,903
It's Mr. Dennis'.

863
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:15,239
He doesn't even know I stole it.

864
01:04:17,108 --> 01:04:19,243
Pretty cool, right?

865
01:04:21,245 --> 01:04:22,780
You can listen to people talking

866
01:04:22,814 --> 01:04:24,515
and they don't even
know you're listening.

867
01:04:27,218 --> 01:04:28,953
Who does this talk to?

868
01:04:28,986 --> 01:04:30,121
Don't touch that.

869
01:04:31,355 --> 01:04:33,157
I just wanna see if it works.

870
01:04:34,992 --> 01:04:36,794
Hey, what are you doing?

871
01:04:36,828 --> 01:04:38,295
Don't touch those buttons.
You're gonna get us found out.

872
01:04:38,329 --> 01:04:40,197
- Yeah, East gate here.
- What up?

873
01:04:45,136 --> 01:04:46,370
Don't talk.

874
01:04:47,404 --> 01:04:49,040
- What up?
- Don't talk.

875
01:04:52,176 --> 01:04:53,210
Hello?

876
01:04:53,244 --> 01:04:54,311
I'm gonna slap you!

877
01:04:54,345 --> 01:04:55,379
Who's this?

878
01:04:58,115 --> 01:05:00,584
Hello. Hello, my name is Casey Cooke.

879
01:05:00,617 --> 01:05:02,954
I'm being held in a basement.
I've been abducted with two other girls.

880
01:05:04,355 --> 01:05:07,091
Who the hell is this?

881
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:16,934
Hello?

882
01:05:17,401 --> 01:05:19,170
Casey Cooke.

883
01:05:19,203 --> 01:05:20,337
I've been abducted.

884
01:05:20,371 --> 01:05:22,907
You need to find me.

885
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24,375
Betty, is that you?

886
01:05:24,408 --> 01:05:25,843
This isn't funny.

887
01:05:25,877 --> 01:05:28,345
Call the police. I must be near you.

888
01:05:28,379 --> 01:05:31,115
I'm being held in a
basement or something.

889
01:05:31,148 --> 01:05:32,516
Okay, Betty, listen.

890
01:05:32,549 --> 01:05:34,485
Tell Larry and Fish I said hi.

891
01:05:34,518 --> 01:05:37,021
Tell him I still got his
orange headphones.

892
01:05:37,054 --> 01:05:38,856
I don't know where I am.

893
01:05:39,456 --> 01:05:41,058
There's a man here.

894
01:05:41,092 --> 01:05:43,360
He abducted us and
he's going to kill me.

895
01:05:53,237 --> 01:05:55,406
I only have a few hours left.

896
01:05:59,911 --> 01:06:00,878
Please.

897
01:06:02,446 --> 01:06:04,081
I'm begging you.

898
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:07,985
Somebody save us.

899
01:06:08,019 --> 01:06:09,921
Wait, who is this?

900
01:06:09,954 --> 01:06:12,456
And how did you get one of our walkies?

901
01:06:20,431 --> 01:06:22,633
Put your hands together in contrition.

902
01:06:24,969 --> 01:06:28,906
"In the sun, we will find our passion.

903
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:32,443
"In the sun,

904
01:06:32,476 --> 01:06:37,414
"we will find our purpose."

905
01:06:47,691 --> 01:06:51,963
I read that on a sympathy
card in a supermarket.

906
01:06:51,996 --> 01:06:55,432
It was for funerals, but
I thought it was beautiful.

907
01:07:00,704 --> 01:07:04,575
Dennis will explain the
meaning of this evening.

908
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:42,646
The Beast is a sentient creature

909
01:07:42,679 --> 01:07:46,517
who represents the highest
form of humans' evolution.

910
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:50,387
He believes the time of
ordinary humanity is over.

911
01:07:52,389 --> 01:07:54,491
I hope this makes you feel calm.

912
01:07:56,393 --> 01:08:01,765
You will be in the presence
of something greater.

913
01:08:01,798 --> 01:08:04,335
I was gonna ask for your last shirt,

914
01:08:04,368 --> 01:08:06,503
but I won't.

915
01:08:06,537 --> 01:08:08,505
Because tonight is a sacred night.

916
01:08:10,141 --> 01:08:11,708
It's almost over.

917
01:08:19,816 --> 01:08:21,518
Casey. Come on.

918
01:08:23,054 --> 01:08:24,988
Let's pretend we're animals again.

919
01:08:25,356 --> 01:08:26,523
Come on.

920
01:08:29,593 --> 01:08:31,495
Casey, come on. This is our game.

921
01:08:34,131 --> 01:08:36,267
I'll tell your dad
you're not being nice.

922
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,689
Come on, take off your stuff.

923
01:08:58,722 --> 01:09:00,757
Animals don't wear clothes.

924
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:02,126
Come on.

925
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:03,560
Yeah, yeah.

926
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,062
Come on.

927
01:09:30,321 --> 01:09:31,788
Hey, Casey bear.

928
01:09:35,326 --> 01:09:36,693
This isn't funny.

929
01:09:41,132 --> 01:09:42,599
Is it loaded?

930
01:09:45,436 --> 01:09:46,670
Casey.

931
01:09:48,539 --> 01:09:49,573
I'm your uncle.

932
01:09:53,144 --> 01:09:54,645
Stop it, Casey.

933
01:09:56,213 --> 01:09:58,115
Put that gun down.

934
01:09:58,149 --> 01:09:59,750
I'm getting upset.

935
01:09:59,783 --> 01:10:01,618
I'm about to get very angry.

936
01:10:01,652 --> 01:10:02,686
Give me the gun!

937
01:10:10,427 --> 01:10:11,762
Could have killed me.

938
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:21,597
This place is closed.
You can't get in.

939
01:11:21,598 --> 01:11:22,299
No, it's okay.

940
01:11:22,333 --> 01:11:23,534
No, it's okay.

941
01:11:29,973 --> 01:11:32,376
Hello, Dennis.

942
01:11:32,409 --> 01:11:35,579
One of the others emailed me just now.

943
01:11:35,612 --> 01:11:37,714
Is everything okay?

944
01:11:37,748 --> 01:11:38,849
We're fine.

945
01:11:39,483 --> 01:11:40,884
Dennis,

946
01:11:40,917 --> 01:11:43,487
Kevin is really lucky to have you.

947
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,257
You are quite extraordinary.

948
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:48,492
I just don't want you guys to get hurt.

949
01:11:54,598 --> 01:11:57,234
You think we're extraordinary?

950
01:11:57,834 --> 01:11:59,703
I like you, Dennis.

951
01:12:00,537 --> 01:12:02,306
May I come in?

952
01:12:02,339 --> 01:12:03,840
And can we talk?

953
01:12:05,942 --> 01:12:08,612
I know you wanna tell me something.

954
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,915
Why don't you just tell me?

955
01:12:27,464 --> 01:12:29,733
We're very similar, you and I.

956
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:31,768
Both on the outside, looking in.

957
01:12:31,802 --> 01:12:33,470
Please, sit.

958
01:12:34,338 --> 01:12:36,940
I don't get many visitors.

959
01:12:36,973 --> 01:12:38,942
Uh, I'll get you some water.

960
01:12:38,975 --> 01:12:41,345
They got a proper quarters for me

961
01:12:41,378 --> 01:12:42,746
in a building on the south side,

962
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:45,549
but we prefer it here.

963
01:12:45,582 --> 01:12:46,750
When they promoted me
to head of maintenance,

964
01:12:46,783 --> 01:12:48,251
they said I could have it.

965
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,588
Who are you going to meet?

966
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:58,829
I wanna talk about

967
01:13:00,331 --> 01:13:01,498
Kevin

968
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:05,902
and what his mother did to him.

969
01:13:07,504 --> 01:13:09,740
I remember it all.

970
01:13:09,773 --> 01:13:12,909
I'm happy you're suddenly so open.

971
01:13:12,943 --> 01:13:15,579
Kevin's mother had
rather malevolent ways

972
01:13:15,612 --> 01:13:18,415
of punishing a three-year-old.

973
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:20,083
Is that when you arrived in the light?

974
01:13:20,116 --> 01:13:20,984
Yeah.

975
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:24,888
The one way to avoid her attention

976
01:13:24,921 --> 01:13:26,457
was to keep everything spotless,

977
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,792
everything perfect.

978
01:13:31,395 --> 01:13:33,997
I know you're coming from
good intentions, Dennis,

979
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:36,867
but there are other ways
to help Kevin now.

980
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:41,938
I've lost so many patients
into the system.

981
01:13:41,972 --> 01:13:45,809
I want you to know, Dennis,
I will never stop fighting for you.

982
01:13:45,842 --> 01:13:49,646
My patients have become my family.

983
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:53,016
They are what I've chosen instead
of a more traditional path.

984
01:13:53,049 --> 01:13:56,687
I hope you feel you can
be truly honest with me.

985
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:59,089
I actually wanna be honest with you.

986
01:14:00,857 --> 01:14:03,460
I lied before.

987
01:14:03,494 --> 01:14:06,096
When you asked if
I'd ever met The Beast,

988
01:14:06,997 --> 01:14:08,932
I said no.

989
01:14:08,965 --> 01:14:10,333
That really isn't true.

990
01:14:13,904 --> 01:14:19,643
You wrote about a woman in Germany
who'd been blind for 10 years.

991
01:14:19,676 --> 01:14:23,146
And then, it was discovered
that she had DID.

992
01:14:23,179 --> 01:14:27,518
Then three of her identities
developed sight.

993
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:31,955
And you speculated that her
optical nerves regenerated

994
01:14:31,988 --> 01:14:34,825
because of her beliefs.

995
01:14:34,858 --> 01:14:36,927
What are you trying to say?

996
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,029
There are things, Dr. Fletcher,

997
01:14:39,062 --> 01:14:41,665
that all of us would
find hard to believe.

998
01:14:41,698 --> 01:14:44,735
Are you trying to tell me
there's a 24th identity?

999
01:14:44,768 --> 01:14:47,170
You protect the broken.

1000
01:14:47,203 --> 01:14:50,907
When you said that you thought
this situation was extraordinary,

1001
01:14:50,941 --> 01:14:53,444
I knew you can maybe understand.

1002
01:14:53,477 --> 01:14:54,845
Understand what?

1003
01:14:54,878 --> 01:14:55,879
The Beast

1004
01:14:57,681 --> 01:14:59,149
is real.

1005
01:15:00,451 --> 01:15:02,085
He's just emerged.

1006
01:15:02,118 --> 01:15:04,555
You were right about everything.

1007
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:06,990
What does he look like?

1008
01:15:09,059 --> 01:15:11,728
He's much bigger than I am

1009
01:15:11,762 --> 01:15:13,764
and I'm the biggest of all of us.

1010
01:15:14,731 --> 01:15:16,467
He's tall.

1011
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,869
He's very muscular.

1012
01:15:18,902 --> 01:15:21,505
And he's got a long mane of hair

1013
01:15:21,538 --> 01:15:25,742
and his fingers are
twice the length of ours.

1014
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:30,447
He believes we are extraordinary.

1015
01:15:30,481 --> 01:15:34,751
That we don't represent
a mistake, but our potential.

1016
01:15:37,688 --> 01:15:39,590
You say the same things.

1017
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:44,060
He's on the move.

1018
01:15:44,661 --> 01:15:46,096
What does that mean?

1019
01:15:47,531 --> 01:15:48,999
I don't understand.

1020
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:51,968
He can't be real.

1021
01:15:53,704 --> 01:15:57,474
There must be limits to what
a human being can become.

1022
01:15:59,175 --> 01:16:00,644
And there's another whole part

1023
01:16:00,677 --> 01:16:03,046
of the story, isn't there?

1024
01:16:03,079 --> 01:16:06,683
About the eating of the impure young?

1025
01:16:06,717 --> 01:16:09,486
What does impure even mean?

1026
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,787
Well...

1027
01:16:10,821 --> 01:16:11,955
We should discuss that

1028
01:16:11,988 --> 01:16:14,124
so that you can understand fully.

1029
01:16:14,157 --> 01:16:15,792
Understand what?

1030
01:16:15,826 --> 01:16:17,561
Sometimes,

1031
01:16:18,862 --> 01:16:20,831
there's just no other way.

1032
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,069
Who are you going to meet?

1033
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:29,806
Him.

1034
01:16:35,078 --> 01:16:36,012
You know what?

1035
01:16:36,046 --> 01:16:38,682
I would love to take notes
on all of this.

1036
01:16:39,816 --> 01:16:41,918
We should probably discuss this

1037
01:16:41,952 --> 01:16:43,286
in a proper session tomorrow.

1038
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:44,955
Really?

1039
01:16:44,988 --> 01:16:46,857
You're okay with this?

1040
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:50,594
This has been so wonderful,
you being so open.

1041
01:16:50,627 --> 01:16:52,929
I can see that you feel very empowered

1042
01:16:52,963 --> 01:16:54,631
by the philosophies of The Beast.

1043
01:16:54,665 --> 01:16:56,700
I'm going to go now.

1044
01:16:56,733 --> 01:16:59,169
I knew you would understand.
I'll see you.

1045
01:17:12,783 --> 01:17:14,651
Would you mind

1046
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,989
if I used your bathroom?

1047
01:17:20,791 --> 01:17:21,792
No.

1048
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:27,197
It's down the hall, near
the stairs, on your left.

1049
01:17:31,668 --> 01:17:33,036
How we doing?

1050
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:35,205
I'm okay.

1051
01:18:15,011 --> 01:18:16,346
Are you real?

1052
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:21,618
Who is it?

1053
01:18:22,052 --> 01:18:23,219
Help me.

1054
01:18:24,888 --> 01:18:25,989
Help me.

1055
01:18:26,022 --> 01:18:27,691
Is someone there?

1056
01:18:30,193 --> 01:18:32,095
Please help me.

1057
01:18:34,731 --> 01:18:36,867
They will never reach their potential.

1058
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,268
They don't really matter.

1059
01:18:38,301 --> 01:18:40,203
Listen to me, Dennis.

1060
01:18:40,904 --> 01:18:43,707
I should've listened better.

1061
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:46,376
I should've understood
what you're capable of,

1062
01:18:46,409 --> 01:18:48,645
how powerful you are.

1063
01:18:48,679 --> 01:18:50,947
Patricia says your way isn't working.

1064
01:18:50,981 --> 01:18:53,116
The world will understand now.

1065
01:18:53,149 --> 01:18:56,987
Dennis, this is an egregious wrong.

1066
01:18:59,022 --> 01:19:00,791
These young women are suffering.

1067
01:19:00,824 --> 01:19:02,659
This is a crime.

1068
01:19:02,693 --> 01:19:04,961
I can't let you keep them here.

1069
01:19:04,995 --> 01:19:06,830
We've gotta stop this.

1070
01:19:06,863 --> 01:19:09,132
This identity is monstrous.

1071
01:19:09,165 --> 01:19:10,901
I'm really sad you feel this way.

1072
01:19:10,934 --> 01:19:12,669
Can't you see?

1073
01:19:12,703 --> 01:19:15,739
He is formed because of
your time in this place.

1074
01:19:42,999 --> 01:19:44,300
There's a lady.

1075
01:19:45,201 --> 01:19:46,903
Someone's here.

1076
01:19:48,739 --> 01:19:50,406
We need to get out of these rooms.

1077
01:19:53,176 --> 01:19:54,410
Is there anything in your room?

1078
01:19:54,444 --> 01:19:55,345
Anything that we could use?

1079
01:20:04,154 --> 01:20:05,789
There's nothing in here.

1080
01:20:08,324 --> 01:20:10,093
There's a hanger.

1081
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:35,251
Thank you, Dennis.

1082
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,288
Here you go, sir.

1083
01:20:57,007 --> 01:21:01,177
It sounded like there were slide
bolts on the outside of our doors.

1084
01:21:01,211 --> 01:21:03,513
See if you can move the lock
through the crack in the door.

1085
01:22:13,383 --> 01:22:15,151
Stay calm.

1086
01:22:15,185 --> 01:22:17,553
We're getting out of here.
We're gonna get Casey.

1087
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:21,024
You can do this, Marcia.

1088
01:22:56,993 --> 01:22:58,528
With regard to Chahamana's defeat

1089
01:22:58,561 --> 01:23:00,363
and Muhammad of Ghor's conquests

1090
01:23:00,396 --> 01:23:03,934
between 1192 and 1200,

1091
01:23:03,967 --> 01:23:07,570
I would liken it to
Muhammad's brazen ultimatum

1092
01:23:07,603 --> 01:23:10,440
that Prithviraj
either apostatize or fight.

1093
01:23:12,542 --> 01:23:16,079
Like Prithviraj's defiance,

1094
01:23:16,112 --> 01:23:19,582
we should stand up
to The Horde's advances.

1095
01:23:19,615 --> 01:23:22,953
In the face of their scare
tactics, we should show...

1096
01:23:24,487 --> 01:23:26,289
I hate my insulin shots.

1097
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:29,559
No one else around here
has to take them.

1098
01:23:29,592 --> 01:23:31,427
Why do I have to have diabetes?

1099
01:23:32,996 --> 01:23:35,265
All the doctors, besides Dr. Fletcher,

1100
01:23:35,298 --> 01:23:38,268
say that we're the same person.

1101
01:23:38,301 --> 01:23:40,336
Just personalities, huh?

1102
01:23:41,504 --> 01:23:42,538
How do you explain I'm the only one

1103
01:23:42,572 --> 01:23:44,007
that needs these, you motherfuck...

1104
01:23:49,579 --> 01:23:51,982
I'm wearing cargo pants from the '90s.

1105
01:23:52,748 --> 01:23:55,085
And a scarf.

1106
01:23:55,118 --> 01:23:57,253
If it wasn't for the
Varvatos T-shirt underneath,

1107
01:23:57,287 --> 01:23:58,921
I'd be a mess.

1108
01:24:00,156 --> 01:24:01,924
I got no taste for things right now.

1109
01:24:03,059 --> 01:24:06,262
I'm worried sick.

1110
01:24:07,663 --> 01:24:11,201
I have a very bad feeling
that I'm losing time.

1111
01:24:11,234 --> 01:24:12,735
I decide who gets the light, right?

1112
01:24:12,768 --> 01:24:14,337
I think

1113
01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:18,341
someone is stealing the light
from me when I'm not aware.

1114
01:24:18,374 --> 01:24:22,678
The Horde keeps obsessing about
the ones who haven't suffered.

1115
01:24:22,712 --> 01:24:26,949
I don't know where they're going
with this, but it scares me.

1116
01:25:28,111 --> 01:25:30,346
Picture yourself
in a couple hours at home.

1117
01:25:31,081 --> 01:25:32,548
On the couch,

1118
01:25:33,649 --> 01:25:36,086
in that ugly-ass sweatshirt
that you love.

1119
01:25:47,197 --> 01:25:49,732
It's an animal!

1120
01:25:49,765 --> 01:25:52,368
He goes like this if there's
a coyote or something.

1121
01:27:32,535 --> 01:27:34,437
Kevin, Kevin.

1122
01:28:02,898 --> 01:28:04,734
Thank you

1123
01:28:06,236 --> 01:28:08,404
for helping us till now.

1124
01:29:14,804 --> 01:29:17,340
I guess I should tell
Dr. Fletcher about this,

1125
01:29:18,574 --> 01:29:20,276
but she'll worry.

1126
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:21,611
She's such a sweet woman.

1127
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:27,650
I believe I will go for a nice walk

1128
01:29:27,683 --> 01:29:30,920
and think this through organizationally.

1129
01:29:33,923 --> 01:29:38,361
Thus ends my journal for Monday.

1130
01:29:38,394 --> 01:29:39,395
Ciao.

1131
01:31:00,810 --> 01:31:01,911
Claire.

1132
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,015
Marcia.

1133
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Claire.

1134
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:32,041
Claire, let's go.

1135
01:32:44,013 --> 01:32:45,848
"Kevin Wendell Crumb."

1136
01:33:11,807 --> 01:33:13,709
Kevin Wendell Crumb?

1137
01:33:18,648 --> 01:33:19,782
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1138
01:33:22,685 --> 01:33:25,020
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

1139
01:33:36,065 --> 01:33:38,000
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1140
01:33:39,702 --> 01:33:42,004
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1141
01:33:42,672 --> 01:33:44,540
You made a mess.

1142
01:33:45,608 --> 01:33:47,042
Come out here.

1143
01:33:49,779 --> 01:33:51,614
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

1144
01:33:51,647 --> 01:33:53,215
You made a mess!

1145
01:33:53,248 --> 01:33:54,516
Get out here!

1146
01:34:21,243 --> 01:34:23,613
Who are you?

1147
01:34:23,646 --> 01:34:25,214
What's happening?

1148
01:34:27,282 --> 01:34:28,918
Something horrible.

1149
01:34:30,886 --> 01:34:32,121
What'd I do?

1150
01:34:34,089 --> 01:34:35,825
Did I hurt you?

1151
01:34:43,899 --> 01:34:45,200
Dr. Fletcher.

1152
01:34:45,835 --> 01:34:47,302
Dr. Fletcher.

1153
01:34:49,672 --> 01:34:51,106
Who did that?

1154
01:34:53,175 --> 01:34:55,044
You did.

1155
01:34:55,077 --> 01:34:58,180
I swear, I was on a bus.

1156
01:34:58,213 --> 01:35:00,115
I don't remember
anything after that. I...

1157
01:35:02,184 --> 01:35:05,154
This is still September 18, 2014, right?

1158
01:35:16,031 --> 01:35:17,933
There's a shotgun I bought.

1159
01:35:19,368 --> 01:35:22,304
It's in the bottom cabinet,
hidden behind things.

1160
01:35:22,337 --> 01:35:25,174
The shells are in my uniform
closet out in the service hall.

1161
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:29,311
Kill me.

1162
01:35:33,182 --> 01:35:34,316
Then kill me.

1163
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:42,024
[AS JADE] Wait, no!

1164
01:35:42,057 --> 01:35:43,693
Don't do that!

1165
01:35:43,726 --> 01:35:45,194
He can't handle reality.

1166
01:35:45,895 --> 01:35:46,829
My name is Jade.

1167
01:35:46,862 --> 01:35:49,064
Has Dr. Fletcher been
getting our emails?

1168
01:35:49,098 --> 01:35:50,432
This is what we have to do.

1169
01:35:51,767 --> 01:35:53,736
[AS ORWELL] As in 1008,

1170
01:35:53,769 --> 01:35:57,740
when Anandapala suffered
the Shahis' most crushing defeat

1171
01:35:57,773 --> 01:36:01,010
and Mahmud overran the entirety
of the Punjab region,

1172
01:36:01,043 --> 01:36:03,713
taking the famed temple of Kangra,

1173
01:36:03,746 --> 01:36:06,849
we have been wronged by this alliance,

1174
01:36:06,882 --> 01:36:09,919
this horde of Patricia,
Dennis and the boy.

1175
01:36:09,952 --> 01:36:12,788
Their actions do not represent us.

1176
01:36:13,355 --> 01:36:15,257
They are every...

1177
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:17,426
[AS BARRY]
Everybody, just take a minute!

1178
01:36:18,193 --> 01:36:20,896
Oh, baby girl.

1179
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:22,965
They've been stealing control
of the light from me.

1180
01:36:22,998 --> 01:36:25,701
But the group are gonna
work through this.

1181
01:36:25,735 --> 01:36:27,803
Honey, my name is Barry.

1182
01:36:37,747 --> 01:36:39,381
[AS HEDWIG] You shouldn't
have used the walkie-talkie.

1183
01:36:43,886 --> 01:36:45,354
They almost caught us.

1184
01:36:47,389 --> 01:36:49,424
Stop it, Hedwig!

1185
01:36:49,458 --> 01:36:52,795
They were right. Look at you.

1186
01:36:52,828 --> 01:36:54,263
You're so frightened of us.

1187
01:36:55,831 --> 01:36:59,935
Dennis and Miss Patricia
are in charge because of me.

1188
01:36:59,969 --> 01:37:02,905
I'm gonna give the light to them now.

1189
01:37:02,938 --> 01:37:06,441
No one's allowed to
make fun of me anymore.

1190
01:37:19,121 --> 01:37:21,256
[AS PATRICIA] Thank you, Hedwig.

1191
01:37:25,494 --> 01:37:27,329
Everything's fine now.

1192
01:37:27,362 --> 01:37:29,131
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1193
01:37:31,366 --> 01:37:33,268
Kevin is asleep.

1194
01:37:33,302 --> 01:37:35,504
We've made him sleep far away.

1195
01:37:35,537 --> 01:37:38,007
You can call his name
all you like, dear,

1196
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:39,942
but he's not going to hear you.

1197
01:37:41,176 --> 01:37:44,213
The Beast has shared with us his dream

1198
01:37:44,246 --> 01:37:47,482
of a larger group to sustain him.

1199
01:37:47,516 --> 01:37:49,151
No.

1200
01:37:49,184 --> 01:37:52,888
Ten to 12 unworthy young next time.

1201
01:37:54,556 --> 01:37:56,992
This is just

1202
01:37:57,559 --> 01:37:58,961
the start.

1203
01:39:18,941 --> 01:39:20,009
Let go!

1204
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:56,578
Help!

1205
01:39:58,647 --> 01:40:01,350
No! No!

1206
01:40:07,122 --> 01:40:08,290
No.

1207
01:40:19,969 --> 01:40:20,970
No.

1208
01:40:23,172 --> 01:40:25,140
It runs in our family.

1209
01:40:26,141 --> 01:40:28,477
My daddy died, too.

1210
01:40:28,510 --> 01:40:30,245
Same way.

1211
01:40:30,279 --> 01:40:31,613
Heart attack.

1212
01:40:34,349 --> 01:40:36,285
But you don't need to worry.

1213
01:40:36,318 --> 01:40:37,586
I'm going to take care of you.

1214
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:42,424
Now,

1215
01:40:43,692 --> 01:40:46,528
you won't be giving me
any trouble, will you?

1216
01:40:47,362 --> 01:40:49,464
I know you won't, sweetie.

1217
01:41:10,552 --> 01:41:13,688
We are glorious!

1218
01:41:15,024 --> 01:41:18,093
We will no longer be afraid.

1219
01:41:27,802 --> 01:41:31,140
Only through pain

1220
01:41:32,407 --> 01:41:34,543
can you achieve your greatness!

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1222
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:55,564
The impure are the untouched,

1223
01:41:55,597 --> 01:41:59,334
the unburned, the unslain.

1224
01:42:02,304 --> 01:42:08,743
Those who have not been torn
have no value in themselves

1225
01:42:08,777 --> 01:42:13,182
and no place in this world!

1226
01:42:13,215 --> 01:42:16,518
They are asleep!

1227
01:42:35,670 --> 01:42:36,671
Fuck!

1228
01:42:37,739 --> 01:42:41,443
Your gun cannot hurt me.

1229
01:42:42,677 --> 01:42:46,047
Can't you see I am not human?

1230
01:42:48,417 --> 01:42:51,553
Kevin is a man. I am much more.

1231
01:44:23,378 --> 01:44:26,848
You are different from the rest.

1232
01:44:37,426 --> 01:44:40,795
Your heart is pure!

1233
01:44:42,664 --> 01:44:44,766
Rejoice!

1234
01:44:50,672 --> 01:44:54,476
The broken are the more evolved.

1235
01:45:00,649 --> 01:45:03,318
Rejoice.

1236
01:46:03,878 --> 01:46:06,415
What in the name of Mary and Joseph?

1237
01:46:07,816 --> 01:46:10,352
What are you doing in this area?

1238
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:53,428
Just keep walking, honey.

1239
01:46:53,462 --> 01:46:54,796
They won't do nothing.

1240
01:47:30,832 --> 01:47:33,868
Vince, call the police.

1241
01:47:33,902 --> 01:47:36,871
She said some people got hurt
in the area below maintenance.

1242
01:47:58,026 --> 01:47:59,027
Okay.

1243
01:48:01,996 --> 01:48:03,865
Now, I'm just gonna check you.

1244
01:48:45,574 --> 01:48:47,909
Third deceased name
of Dr. Karen Fletcher.

1245
01:48:47,942 --> 01:48:50,144
Still trying to locate the family.

1246
01:49:07,662 --> 01:49:09,598
Casey Cooke's guardian's here.

1247
01:49:20,074 --> 01:49:21,876
Your uncle's here.

1248
01:49:23,545 --> 01:49:25,113
You ready to go?

1249
01:50:14,763 --> 01:50:16,264
[AS DENNIS] It didn't go through.

1250
01:50:21,703 --> 01:50:25,239
[AS PATRICIA] We are
what we believe we are.

1251
01:50:31,012 --> 01:50:33,582
Holy shit!

1252
01:50:33,615 --> 01:50:36,050
This is so cool!

1253
01:50:39,287 --> 01:50:41,923
They're gonna believe
we exist now, right?

1254
01:50:44,959 --> 01:50:46,227
[AS DENNIS] They're gonna have to.

1255
01:50:48,997 --> 01:50:51,032
[AS HEDWIG] So what do we do now?

1256
01:50:54,836 --> 01:50:56,170
[AS PATRICIA] We trust in him.

1257
01:50:58,773 --> 01:51:00,108
He'll protect us.

1258
01:51:01,843 --> 01:51:05,146
Look at what he can do.

1259
01:51:07,215 --> 01:51:10,952
Let him show the world
how powerful we can be.

1260
01:51:20,695 --> 01:51:23,197
The suspected murderer Kevin Crumb

1261
01:51:23,231 --> 01:51:27,335
suffers from the controversial
psychological disorder DID.

1262
01:51:27,368 --> 01:51:30,939
The rumors coming out of the scene
are almost unbelievable.

1263
01:51:30,972 --> 01:51:34,743
There are conflicting stories
if the suspect is alive or dead

1264
01:51:34,776 --> 01:51:37,612
after sustaining
two point-blank gunshots.

1265
01:51:37,646 --> 01:51:40,181
Reports even indicate
one of his personalities

1266
01:51:40,214 --> 01:51:42,617
is an amalgam of the various animals

1267
01:51:42,651 --> 01:51:44,886
in the Philadelphia Zoo where he worked.

1268
01:51:44,919 --> 01:51:47,889
The press is already referring
to the alleged attacker

1269
01:51:47,922 --> 01:51:51,860
by a dark name leaked by
a source close to the case.

1270
01:51:51,893 --> 01:51:54,729
Because of his many personalities,
he is being called...

1271
01:51:54,763 --> 01:51:55,830
The Horde.

1272
01:51:57,331 --> 01:51:59,668
This is like that crazy guy
in the wheelchair

1273
01:51:59,701 --> 01:52:02,236
that they put away 15 years ago.

1274
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:04,773
And they gave him a funny name, too.

1275
01:52:05,674 --> 01:52:07,208
What was it?

1276
01:52:07,876 --> 01:52:09,310
Mr. Glass.

1277
01:52:09,343 --> 01:52:10,311
Oh, yeah.
