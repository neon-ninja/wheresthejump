1
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:13,860
Will.

2
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:23,705
Full severance package and a book deal.

3
00:01:24,775 --> 00:01:26,402
Total non-disclosure.

4
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:27,671
Uh-huh.

5
00:01:31,782 --> 00:01:33,409
Total.

6
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:37,211
Okay, boys. Get his stuff.

7
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:41,622
Danish? Eclair?

8
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:56,533
I'm gonna miss you, Will.

9
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:57,835
Mmm-hmm.

10
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:01,370
Little afternoon
pick-me-up, Mr. A?

11
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:02,912
I'm okay, Tommy.

12
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,004
Remodeling?

13
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:05,070
No, I quit.

14
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,414
Why would you do that?

15
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:10,510
He wants to spend more
time with his family.

16
00:02:10,587 --> 00:02:13,215
Didn't know you had a family.
Spend all your time here.

17
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,882
Well, I do.

18
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:23,490
Oh!

19
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:31,436
Oh, to the best editor who
ever escaped the dreary halls of GPH.

20
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:32,902
To Will.

21
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:34,976
To Will.

22
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:37,270
We're gonna miss you, Mr. Atenton.

23
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:39,474
Thank you. Thank you.

24
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:54,355
So, you finally made it out the door?

25
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:55,796
Yes.

26
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:59,396
You have some brilliant ideas
in your head. Let them out.

27
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:00,458
You think?

28
00:03:00,537 --> 00:03:03,370
You don't want to be chained to
your desk as an old editor, do you?

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,930
No.

30
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:09,040
Here. Best contractor
in Fairfield County.

31
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,777
Can't do it all by yourself.

32
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:13,910
I shall miss you.

33
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,343
Good luck.

34
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,682
Thank you.

35
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:47,444
Hey.

36
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:16,974
Hey, Atenton!

37
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:21,416
Will. How you doing?
Heather. Heather Keeler.

38
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:24,643
I found your house. Yes, sorry.

39
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:26,382
Yes. Yes. Bramble Branch.

40
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:27,514
How are you doing? I'm well.

41
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:28,683
Do you need a lift?

42
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,226
No, no, I'm getting a taxi.

43
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:33,091
A cab in this weather? Come
on. I'll give you a lift.

44
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:37,323
No, no, Heather.
Mine's the one on the left.

45
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:41,334
But you know that, don't you?

46
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:45,466
Okay, here we
are. Enjoy your new home.

47
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:47,204
Thank you. You have a good night.

48
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:48,608
Good night.

49
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:17,438
Sweetie, I just wanted
to know, did you get the 7:15?

50
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:20,965
Cause I really don't know whether
to put the kids to bed or not.

51
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:22,375
So, give me a call or
let me know...

52
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:23,970
Oh, Jesus!

53
00:05:24,748 --> 00:05:26,807
Oh, Will!

54
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:30,244
You gave me a fright.

55
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:32,788
Crazy.

56
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,694
You don't answer
the phone? What's going on?

57
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:42,522
What?

58
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:49,198
You did it.

59
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:51,137
You didn't? You didn't?

60
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,937
You didn't think I would, did
you? I didn't think you would.

61
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,206
You did it! Oh, you
did it! I'm so proud of you!

62
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,611
Oh, we're gonna be so much happier.

63
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:00,047
The kids are gonna be so much happier.

64
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:01,175
Where are they?

65
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:02,912
Oh, the kids are asleep.

66
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:04,385
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

67
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:06,820
Mrs. Atenton.

68
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,380
Mr. Atenton.

69
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:19,094
What's this?

70
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,363
Oh, this is the kids' painting.

71
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:21,631
Um...

72
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:23,439
Have the children gone to bed?

73
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:25,236
Yeah, the children are very...

74
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:27,742
They're very tired. I put them in bed.

75
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:29,438
And they've been
working all day? Mmm-hmm.

76
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:30,775
Yeah? Yeah.

77
00:06:31,982 --> 00:06:34,951
I'll just put my coat
down here, like this,

78
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:36,610
and then my...

79
00:06:37,854 --> 00:06:40,288
And this is a... This
is a new cushion, I see.

80
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:41,784
Shall I give it a squeeze?

81
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:43,416
I think you should. Mmm-hmm.

82
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:46,121
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

83
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:48,562
Daddy's home! Daddy's home!

84
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,797
What have you been doing?

85
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:53,130
Um, painting!

86
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,632
Painting! Oh, really?

87
00:06:54,704 --> 00:06:56,729
Sweetie, you wanna
show Daddy the surprise?

88
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:57,831
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

89
00:06:57,908 --> 00:06:58,966
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah?

90
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:00,270
That surprise.

91
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:07,310
Okay, ready, Dee Dee?

92
00:07:07,784 --> 00:07:10,184
One, two, three, go!

93
00:07:10,787 --> 00:07:12,516
Wow!

94
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:14,181
Do you like it? Yeah, I do.

95
00:07:14,257 --> 00:07:15,281
Really? Yeah.

96
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:17,019
Honestly? Yeah, you're hired.

97
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:18,685
You can't afford me.

98
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:20,525
I think I might be able to.

99
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:27,334
What is that? There's a very
strange smell around here.

100
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:29,031
You! You! You! You! You!

101
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:30,572
I know what it is. Mmm-hmm.

102
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,767
Stinky. Mmm-hmm. It's stinky kids.

103
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:33,969
Stinky kids.

104
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:35,909
Stinky kids need bath time! Stinky kids.

105
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,851
Are you gonna tell me
what this novel's about?

106
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:48,322
If I tell you about it, then...

107
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:51,693
Well, then it all disappears,
doesn't it?

108
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:55,923
But I can see the
characters, Libby. I can.

109
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:59,293
Just... Just as clearly as I can...

110
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:02,433
Thank you. ...as I can see you now.

111
00:08:04,774 --> 00:08:06,799
Thanks for the flowers.

112
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:12,540
When? I didn't give them to you.

113
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:14,277
I found them on the porch this morning.

114
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:17,278
They're probably from a secret admirer.

115
00:08:17,354 --> 00:08:18,378
Of yours.

116
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:20,150
No. Maybe.

117
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:25,157
Some gentleman caller leaving
you flowers on the doorstep.

118
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:29,832
Missed you.

119
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,440
I feel so safe when you're here.

120
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:44,373
Well, I'm not gonna go anywhere.

121
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:57,088
What are you thinking about?

122
00:08:58,662 --> 00:09:00,630
Ah, memories, maybe.

123
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:02,356
Hmm.

124
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,573
Do you remember this?

125
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:15,675
Forever.

126
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:24,217
You remember this? Just
a little bit of this.

127
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:29,923
You remember this?

128
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:54,082
You okay? Yeah.

129
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:56,584
All right. See you Sunday.

130
00:09:58,922 --> 00:10:00,048
Can you have her back by 9:00?

131
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:01,852
Oh, for Christ's sake, I know the drill.

132
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:04,393
Can't we have a single
exchange without you turning...

133
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:06,019
Without you twisting the knife?

134
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:08,064
No, it seems we can't.

135
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:11,031
Bye.

136
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:14,136
Bye, honey.

137
00:10:54,077 --> 00:10:56,136
That's all I know. That's good.

138
00:10:58,148 --> 00:10:59,672
That's good.

139
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:27,769
Will, come here.

140
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:31,438
Come take a look at this.

141
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:38,687
Would you look at that?

142
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,025
You know what? I'm not
gonna paint over it.

143
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:47,325
Don't. Belongs to the house.

144
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:51,022
They used to run up those stairs.

145
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:55,863
Wonder where they are now.

146
00:11:56,773 --> 00:11:59,037
Driving their parents insane.

147
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,612
Your financial statements, sir.

148
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:15,454
It's not what we hoped.

149
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:19,426
Any word on your custody appeal?

150
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,691
Sorry, sir.

151
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:48,588
Enter.

152
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:52,857
Hey, Shakespeare. Just
brought you some tea.

153
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:58,326
Hey, Dee Dee. Dee Dee, leave
Daddy alone. He's writing. Come on.

154
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:00,494
Dee Dee, come on, come out of
there. Daddy's working. Come on.

155
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,764
I want Daddy.

156
00:13:01,838 --> 00:13:04,136
He's working right now. I told you.

157
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:06,074
Will?

158
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,510
I want to go home to my own house.

159
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:10,773
This is your house.

160
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:13,240
This is where we live. Come on, baby.

161
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,280
Come here. Give me your hands.

162
00:13:16,352 --> 00:13:19,412
What are you so scared
about? What's going on?

163
00:13:21,558 --> 00:13:23,082
Tell me. What's going on?

164
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,753
Mom, she saw a man in the window.

165
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:27,318
I couldn't find him.

166
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:29,860
Where?

167
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,333
Show me.

168
00:13:35,638 --> 00:13:37,265
He was right there.

169
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,500
What did he look like, baby?

170
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:40,167
She said he had a big head.

171
00:13:40,243 --> 00:13:41,642
And it was fuzzy.

172
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:44,809
Fuzzy?

173
00:13:45,148 --> 00:13:46,410
Sweetie, do you mean a pretend person?

174
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:47,710
Is that what you're talking about?

175
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:49,513
Wait a minute. I know
what you saw. Look.

176
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:50,985
You saw the twigs at
the bottom of the garden.

177
00:13:51,054 --> 00:13:52,885
Looks like... That
looks like a man, see?

178
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:55,123
No, he was right there.

179
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,189
Wait a minute. Look at this.

180
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:01,964
Watch. Look at the window. And...

181
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:03,556
See?

182
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
See? It was your own
reflection.
When Trish turned on the light, it
wasn't a man, it was you, little one.
It was you.

183
00:14:12,008 --> 00:14:13,737
It's okay, it's okay.

184
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,477
Who peed their pants?
You did!

185
00:14:18,548 --> 00:14:19,913
Did you pee your pants? You did.

186
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:21,109
Did you pee your pants?

187
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:22,879
You did. Come on.

188
00:16:24,674 --> 00:16:26,164
You okay?

189
00:16:27,477 --> 00:16:28,705
Mmm-hmm.

190
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:33,108
Come on, you're worried about
something. Tell me what's going on.

191
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:35,047
You're so beautiful.

192
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,054
Stay like that forever.

193
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:42,647
Sorry. No, not possible, not forever.

194
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,022
Shucks.

195
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:49,846
Mommy's sad.

196
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,581
Daddy, aren't you gonna kill us again?

197
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,618
What are you doing?

198
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:00,354
Go, go!

199
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:02,857
Shit!

200
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:04,494
Shit.

201
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:13,373
Get up! What were you doing in there?

202
00:19:13,442 --> 00:19:15,000
We didn't know anybody lived here!

203
00:19:15,077 --> 00:19:16,101
I live there!

204
00:19:16,178 --> 00:19:17,805
Well, you scared the shit out of me!

205
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,370
Well, what were you doing down there?

206
00:19:19,682 --> 00:19:21,616
It's 'cause of the murders.

207
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:23,077
What murders?

208
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:25,545
You live here, and you
don't know about the murders?

209
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:28,021
The snowstorm? In April?

210
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,490
Come on, man, the whole
family got murdered!

211
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:33,262
Have you been looking
in through my windows?

212
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:34,821
He's back.

213
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:37,056
That is him.

214
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:38,122
He's back.

215
00:19:38,434 --> 00:19:39,992
Who's back?

216
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:41,798
He's back. That is him!

217
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:43,065
Sweet!

218
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:44,265
He's back!

219
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:50,705
Jerk.

220
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:55,208
Hey. What... Who is it?

221
00:19:55,484 --> 00:19:57,577
It's nothing, Libby.
It's just some kids.

222
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:01,317
They were just messing about. Go
back to bed. I'll be up in a minute.

223
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,584
Okay.

224
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:42,126
The department doesn't
close unsolved homicides,

225
00:20:42,198 --> 00:20:44,894
so, officially, the case is still open.

226
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:46,662
But I've only been on
the job a couple of years,

227
00:20:46,736 --> 00:20:48,363
so I don't know a lot
about the old cases.

228
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:49,927
You must be able to tell me something.

229
00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:52,736
I mean, who did it, for Christ's sake?

230
00:20:56,212 --> 00:20:59,147
Well, the focus came down on the father.

231
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:01,945
Peter Ward. He went a little nuts.

232
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,289
I thought you said the
whole family were killed.

233
00:21:07,356 --> 00:21:09,119
Well, the family was
shot. The father survived.

234
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:10,180
So he's still alive?

235
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:11,248
I don't really know.

236
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:13,022
Well, where is he?
I don't know.

237
00:21:13,095 --> 00:21:15,563
Look. You can let me look
at the case files and then...

238
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:17,724
I can't do that. It's police
business. No. I'll do it on my own.

239
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,028
Well, if you're not
gonna do it, I'll do it.

240
00:21:19,101 --> 00:21:20,466
We can't hand it out
to the general public.

241
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,735
Well, I'm hardly
the general public, am l?

242
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:25,501
I mean, I bought the crime
scene, for Christ's sake!

243
00:21:25,574 --> 00:21:28,543
New Ashford is a safe town now, okay?

244
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:31,102
So you got nothing to worry about.

245
00:21:31,347 --> 00:21:32,405
Have a nice day.

246
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:38,619
Take care now.

247
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:50,798
Libby?

248
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,258
Libby?

249
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:55,667
In here.

250
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:00,333
What's going on?

251
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:03,810
She heard the kid from
across the street on her cell.

252
00:22:05,314 --> 00:22:06,611
What did she say?

253
00:22:06,816 --> 00:22:10,411
Everybody who lives in
this house gets killed.

254
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,978
Oh, God Almighty.

255
00:22:12,054 --> 00:22:14,614
Why would she say something like that?

256
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:18,721
I told them we'd wait
till Daddy got home.

257
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,123
Okay. Let me...

258
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:34,271
Hi, there. Hi.

259
00:22:34,343 --> 00:22:38,473
Look, were you talking on your
phone near our house just now?

260
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:40,272
I just... Mom!

261
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:42,078
Can I just...

262
00:22:43,252 --> 00:22:47,348
Hi! I'm Will Atenton from across
the street. I wanted... Can l...

263
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,714
Can l...

264
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:56,090
Hi. Um, look, we...

265
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:59,894
We just found out what
happened in our house.

266
00:22:59,969 --> 00:23:01,231
I didn't mean
to upset your daughter,

267
00:23:01,303 --> 00:23:03,066
but I think she might have been talking

268
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:05,164
with some friends on the
phone, near the house,

269
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:07,971
and my daughters overheard, and
they're five and seven and...

270
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:09,704
I know she didn't do it
on purpose. It's just...

271
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:11,671
I'll talk to her.

272
00:23:11,747 --> 00:23:14,682
Thank you. Thank you.
That's all I'm asking.

273
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,617
You know, it was the fifth
anniversary a few days ago,

274
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:20,348
and my daughter's been
having nightmares again.

275
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:22,287
I'm sorry about that. That's awful.

276
00:23:25,761 --> 00:23:26,785
Did...

277
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:29,660
Did you leave some flowers on our porch?

278
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,299
Mom! No.

279
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:33,357
What?

280
00:23:33,435 --> 00:23:35,232
Hey, can l see you for a minute?

281
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:38,433
Right. Okay, thank you.

282
00:23:38,507 --> 00:23:40,600
The house has been empty a long time.

283
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:41,768
Um...

284
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:45,074
Yes, except we've...

285
00:23:45,147 --> 00:23:47,775
We've got an infestation of
teenagers in our basement.

286
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,308
And you... You wouldn't know...

287
00:23:51,387 --> 00:23:52,820
You wouldn't know... Do
they live around here?

288
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:56,551
I'd like to talk to their parents
just so I can keep them away.

289
00:23:59,028 --> 00:24:01,519
Right. I'm sorry to bother you.

290
00:24:02,464 --> 00:24:04,159
Have a good day.

291
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:55,183
What are you doing?

292
00:24:57,052 --> 00:24:58,110
Um...

293
00:24:58,854 --> 00:25:00,287
What's going on?

294
00:25:00,723 --> 00:25:03,886
I'm just covering this
up. I couldn't sleep.

295
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:21,338
What is this?

296
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,708
Those kids, you know? That l...

297
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:26,843
The ones I chased off? They left this.

298
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:39,554
"Slaughter house."

299
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,091
Who's Peter Ward?

300
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:53,005
Why didn't you just tell me?

301
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:57,570
Because I didn't want you to worry.

302
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:00,777
I just knew we shouldn't
have moved out of the city.

303
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:01,838
Libby, don't say that.

304
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:03,441
I knew that this wasn't gonna last.

305
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,248
What? This!

306
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:10,581
There's something wrong with this house.

307
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:12,092
No, Libby, there isn't.

308
00:26:13,762 --> 00:26:16,856
We'll do whatever it
takes, okay? We'll...

309
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,362
We'll hire a priest.

310
00:26:19,935 --> 00:26:23,427
Hire a priest?
Where do you do that?

311
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,204
Well, it's... Or a witch
doctor, whatever. I don't know.

312
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:29,244
We'll feng shui the place.
It's our house.

313
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,268
Hmm?

314
00:26:32,614 --> 00:26:34,878
There's joy in this house.

315
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:38,683
There's real joy in this
house. You're in it, so...

316
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:41,085
What?

317
00:26:44,727 --> 00:26:46,718
What is that out there?

318
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,564
There.

319
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:02,005
Hey!

320
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:08,177
Go in!

321
00:27:11,053 --> 00:27:12,213
Will?

322
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

323
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:48,914
Will!

324
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:50,549
I'm all right! I'm all right.

325
00:27:51,293 --> 00:27:52,385
Will!

326
00:27:53,295 --> 00:27:54,353
Go back in the house!

327
00:27:54,897 --> 00:27:57,092
Go! Get back in the house!

328
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:33,934
Girls?

329
00:28:49,384 --> 00:28:50,817
Girls!

330
00:28:51,753 --> 00:28:53,186
Trish?

331
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:57,948
Dee Dee?

332
00:28:59,228 --> 00:29:00,661
Girls?

333
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:04,689
Trish?

334
00:29:10,005 --> 00:29:11,029
Girls?

335
00:29:31,326 --> 00:29:32,554
Will?

336
00:29:32,928 --> 00:29:34,190
I can't find the girls.

337
00:29:34,263 --> 00:29:36,891
They're not in bed, they're not in the
garden. I don't know where they are.

338
00:29:36,965 --> 00:29:40,230
Girls, come on! It's not
funny! Come out right now! Kids!

339
00:29:40,302 --> 00:29:41,428
Did you look under the bed?

340
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:42,697
No!

341
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:46,539
Girls, come on now, where are you?

342
00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:48,075
Trish?

343
00:29:56,785 --> 00:29:58,582
Libby? What?

344
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:28,275
Okay. How many lumps?

345
00:30:28,717 --> 00:30:30,810
One lump of sugar, please.

346
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:36,650
Would you like any tea, Princess Katherine?

347
00:30:36,992 --> 00:30:38,653
Yes, please, Prince Beatrice.

348
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:40,024
Okay.

349
00:30:40,095 --> 00:30:42,359
What are
you girls doing in here?

350
00:30:42,431 --> 00:30:43,625
Are we interrupting you?

351
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:46,161
Hello, Mommy. Hello, Daddy.

352
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:48,795
Hello, Mommy. We found a
little girl's clubhouse.

353
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,337
I see.

354
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:52,195
Wow.

355
00:30:52,274 --> 00:30:54,674
Oh, my goodness
me, look at all of this.

356
00:30:54,743 --> 00:30:56,108
And you're having tea?

357
00:30:56,178 --> 00:30:57,167
Yep.

358
00:30:57,246 --> 00:30:59,214
But we were
looking for you. You were?

359
00:30:59,281 --> 00:31:00,578
We were looking for you everywhere.

360
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:02,048
How long have you been in here for?

361
00:31:02,117 --> 00:31:03,141
When did you get in here?

362
00:31:03,218 --> 00:31:05,186
About two hours. What is this, baby?

363
00:31:05,254 --> 00:31:07,017
Two hours. Two hours ago?

364
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:09,523
You've been in here for two
hours? And how did you find it?

365
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:10,615
It's an amazing place.

366
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:11,852
I fell through the wall.

367
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:13,053
Oh, really?

368
00:31:13,128 --> 00:31:14,356
You didn't hurt yourself? No.

369
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:16,522
No. Look at all these toys.

370
00:31:16,598 --> 00:31:18,361
I fell in the box.

371
00:31:19,768 --> 00:31:21,292
Look at that.

372
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:27,407
"This book belongs to Katherine Ward."

373
00:31:27,476 --> 00:31:30,001
And this belongs to Beatrice, see?

374
00:31:30,712 --> 00:31:32,805
Let me see that, sweetie.

375
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,084
Yeah, she wrote it in there in ink.

376
00:31:38,787 --> 00:31:39,845
Hmm.

377
00:31:41,757 --> 00:31:42,746
Do you think this
is where they played?

378
00:31:42,824 --> 00:31:43,848
Yeah.

379
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:45,790
This is their secret clubhouse.

380
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:47,351
Uh-huh.

381
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:49,153
They were happy here.

382
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:51,392
They were? How do you know that?

383
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:52,797
She just knows.

384
00:31:54,636 --> 00:31:56,263
Okay, I need a cup of tea.

385
00:31:57,139 --> 00:31:58,265
Lavender, lavender.

386
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,104
Lavender tea,
please, to calm my nerves.

387
00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:10,780
I just can't believe all this stuff.

388
00:32:10,852 --> 00:32:12,615
Yeah, I know.

389
00:32:19,561 --> 00:32:21,119
That's our house, Will.

390
00:32:21,663 --> 00:32:22,652
Yeah.

391
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:24,995
I mean, how could the neighbors
not have said anything to us?

392
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:26,796
I don't understand. Nothing. Not a word.

393
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:29,894
Well, they're all freaked out about
having a murderer in their midst.

394
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:33,065
They just care about
property prices, that's all.

395
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:34,833
Jesus Christ.

396
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:39,044
He shot the little one in the back.

397
00:32:56,798 --> 00:32:58,425
Will? I got it!

398
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:01,827
Hello.

399
00:33:02,637 --> 00:33:04,195
I brought you some stew.

400
00:33:04,272 --> 00:33:06,797
I thought you might like
something you could just heat up.

401
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:09,673
With all the work you're doing
in here, you must be busy.

402
00:33:09,745 --> 00:33:11,474
Thank you so much. That's...

403
00:33:11,546 --> 00:33:13,207
That's incredibly generous of you.

404
00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:15,647
I felt a little bad
about our last meeting.

405
00:33:15,717 --> 00:33:18,743
No, don't. Please, well, look, come in.

406
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:20,446
Hey, open up!

407
00:33:20,522 --> 00:33:21,546
No!

408
00:33:21,623 --> 00:33:23,215
I live with a
herd of elephants, sorry.

409
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:25,156
Can you keep it down, just a bit?

410
00:33:25,227 --> 00:33:26,251
Okay, Dad!

411
00:33:26,328 --> 00:33:28,489
Will, who is that at the door?

412
00:33:28,563 --> 00:33:29,996
I'm... I don't know your name.

413
00:33:30,665 --> 00:33:32,223
Ann Patterson.

414
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:35,034
It's Ann Patterson from across
the street. Come down, say hello.

415
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,433
Down in a minute.

416
00:33:44,546 --> 00:33:46,343
I should go. Okay.

417
00:33:46,948 --> 00:33:48,745
You'll come back?

418
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:51,213
Ann!

419
00:33:52,053 --> 00:33:54,044
Did you know the people
who used to live here?

420
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:15,770
Why didn't you come down and say hello?

421
00:34:26,755 --> 00:34:27,881
What's wrong?

422
00:34:28,423 --> 00:34:30,357
This is where the mother was shot.

423
00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:34,156
Okay.

424
00:34:44,306 --> 00:34:46,638
Children were shot right here.

425
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,243
Peter Ward.

426
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:00,847
Now listen to this.

427
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:04,449
It's a letter to the editor
from just a few weeks ago.

428
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,023
"It is impossible to comprehend
how a psychotic murderer

429
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:10,690
"could be placed in a
residential treatment program

430
00:35:10,765 --> 00:35:13,825
"with total disregard for the community.

431
00:35:13,902 --> 00:35:15,563
"Harkness House is located

432
00:35:15,637 --> 00:35:19,073
"within a half mile of my
children's elementary school."

433
00:35:26,448 --> 00:35:28,780
Hey, man. Good luck in there.

434
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:33,450
When people talk to you, you
oughtn't be rude to them, asshole.

435
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:35,483
Yeah, all right.

436
00:35:40,629 --> 00:35:42,062
Unis, has the mail come yet?

437
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,291
Jesus, Brady, I've been here three days

438
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:46,163
and you keep asking
the same damn question.

439
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:49,567
It already came, and you
already didn't get nothing.

440
00:35:50,238 --> 00:35:51,705
You got the release papers for me?

441
00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:53,832
No. I'm not a patient. I'm...

442
00:35:53,909 --> 00:35:55,206
Client. Right.

443
00:35:56,177 --> 00:35:58,042
I need to talk to you
about one of your clients.

444
00:35:58,113 --> 00:35:59,910
Unis, has the mail come yet?

445
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:01,573
Hey, go on.

446
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,274
Move!

447
00:36:03,351 --> 00:36:04,340
Come on.

448
00:36:04,419 --> 00:36:05,613
Let's watch a little ping-pong.

449
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:08,945
You need to speak to Mrs. O'Brien.

450
00:36:09,024 --> 00:36:10,685
You can just have a seat over there.

451
00:36:17,365 --> 00:36:18,889
I said you could have a seat.

452
00:36:20,702 --> 00:36:23,068
Yeah. Right, thank you.

453
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,929
What are you doing with my stuff?

454
00:37:29,204 --> 00:37:31,138
This is my stuff.

455
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,834
Where'd you get this?

456
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:35,509
Calm down! Why are you so angry?

457
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:38,512
This was in my kids'
room. Where did you get it?

458
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,138
I don't understand what
you're saying, all right?

459
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:41,375
I'll explain it to you.

460
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:44,976
Peter Ward, stay away from
my family, or I'll kill you!

461
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:46,547
Peter Ward?

462
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:49,386
There's no Peter Ward here.

463
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:53,325
No. I'm Martin.

464
00:37:58,667 --> 00:37:59,964
Look.

465
00:38:01,436 --> 00:38:03,404
Peter Ward's out there, man.

466
00:38:12,847 --> 00:38:14,371
I'm sorry.

467
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:33,865
Will?

468
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,731
What happened?

469
00:38:38,506 --> 00:38:39,598
Not a lot.

470
00:38:39,674 --> 00:38:40,732
Not a lot?

471
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:42,140
Hey, babies.

472
00:38:42,444 --> 00:38:44,241
Why are you
keeping things from me?

473
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:47,880
I'm not.

474
00:38:51,486 --> 00:38:53,545
Was Ward at Harkness House, yes or no?

475
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:56,089
No, he wasn't, but it's fine.

476
00:38:56,157 --> 00:38:57,988
It's not fine. You wanna
know why it's not fine?

477
00:38:58,059 --> 00:38:59,424
Because he was outside
the window looking in.

478
00:38:59,494 --> 00:39:00,552
The kids just saw him.

479
00:39:00,628 --> 00:39:02,061
They're imagining things,
honey... I saw him!

480
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,119
Well, then we'll call the police!

481
00:39:03,198 --> 00:39:04,222
I did.

482
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:06,993
What is that?

483
00:39:07,569 --> 00:39:09,332
It's a car.

484
00:39:09,404 --> 00:39:11,634
Okay, okay, kids, everything's okay.

485
00:39:11,706 --> 00:39:13,230
Daddy's home.

486
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:16,710
Just dial it down a bit, please.

487
00:39:20,181 --> 00:39:21,773
Just stay here.

488
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:31,686
What are you doing? What
the hell are you doing?

489
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,288
Kids, go upstairs now and lock the door!

490
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:37,789
Hey!

491
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:39,896
I know who you are, Ward!

492
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,772
Will! Libby, get inside!

493
00:40:05,527 --> 00:40:07,859
Wait, wait, hold it, hold it, hold it!

494
00:40:07,929 --> 00:40:09,487
Look, you've come at the wrong end.

495
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:11,088
The guy's driving a maroon Buick.

496
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:13,031
He's got a hooded
parka on. He's gone now.

497
00:40:13,101 --> 00:40:14,932
Okay, all right. Calm down.

498
00:40:15,003 --> 00:40:16,800
I will calm down. But
he's just... All right.

499
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:18,498
This guy's just come in and
threatened me and my wife.

500
00:40:18,573 --> 00:40:19,972
Sir, everything is under control.

501
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:21,531
It doesn't seem to be.
You know what? Look.

502
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:22,633
Hey! Hey!

503
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,938
It's a photograph.

504
00:40:24,012 --> 00:40:25,809
Look, he took this from
my house. All right.

505
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,780
He's not in Greenhaven. Okay,
the whole neighborhood...

506
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:28,838
He's back here! ...doesn't have to know.

507
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,544
What do you mean, the
whole neighborhood?

508
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:32,676
You must have just passed
him now on the road.

509
00:40:32,754 --> 00:40:35,086
Did you see him? A maroon Buick?

510
00:40:35,156 --> 00:40:36,555
Hooded parka. Just calm down.

511
00:40:36,624 --> 00:40:38,819
What are you taking notes for?
Get in the car and go after him!

512
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:39,985
Would you keep your voice down, please?

513
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:42,359
You know what, I'm gonna get
a gun, I'll shoot him myself!

514
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,897
Go get some sleep, sir.

515
00:40:43,965 --> 00:40:45,398
Oh, you guys, Jesus Christ!

516
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:47,932
Useless!

517
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:55,442
He's been in our house?

518
00:40:56,077 --> 00:40:57,704
He had this.

519
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:10,650
Why are they not helping us?

520
00:41:40,288 --> 00:41:41,915
I really appreciate you doing this.

521
00:41:43,324 --> 00:41:46,418
I don't understand why
the police won't help us.

522
00:41:46,694 --> 00:41:49,288
Let's just make sure we're
talking about the same man.

523
00:41:49,364 --> 00:41:51,355
Please, sit down.

524
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:53,160
Peter Ward.

525
00:41:53,668 --> 00:41:55,465
Well, I'm just...

526
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,705
I'm just trying to protect my family.

527
00:42:13,354 --> 00:42:14,821
What's that?

528
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,015
It's a gunshot wound.

529
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:20,492
I don't understand, why...
If he was a suspect, who...

530
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:22,588
Who shot him?

531
00:42:22,664 --> 00:42:23,722
His wife.

532
00:42:24,532 --> 00:42:27,433
Somehow she'd gotten
the gun away from him.

533
00:42:27,502 --> 00:42:29,129
Fought back before she died.

534
00:42:32,373 --> 00:42:34,000
What's he screaming?

535
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:37,340
He wants to get out, to find the
man who killed his wife and children.

536
00:42:38,112 --> 00:42:39,511
You filmed him all the time?

537
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,708
We had to, to protect ourselves.

538
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:50,324
He was not competent to stand trial.

539
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:54,122
We held him as long as we could
without conclusive evidence.

540
00:42:55,163 --> 00:42:56,425
Wait, can you... Sorry.

541
00:42:56,497 --> 00:42:59,955
Can you just rewind that
a little, just to there?

542
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:01,194
Stop.

543
00:43:01,402 --> 00:43:02,391
Sir...

544
00:43:05,573 --> 00:43:06,938
That's Ann Patterson.

545
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:10,302
She's... She lives
across the road from us.

546
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:13,046
I knew she knew him.

547
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:17,510
Let's go on. You'll understand.

548
00:43:20,388 --> 00:43:21,855
At a certain point,

549
00:43:21,923 --> 00:43:24,323
he simply refused to believe
that he was Peter Ward.

550
00:43:24,392 --> 00:43:26,553
You see, in his mind,
if he wasn't Peter Ward,

551
00:43:26,627 --> 00:43:28,527
he couldn't have killed
his wife and family.

552
00:43:28,596 --> 00:43:30,461
Well, what's he doing now?

553
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:34,399
He refused to allow his name to
appear on any of the hospital IDs.

554
00:43:34,469 --> 00:43:36,937
So he chewed them off

555
00:43:38,272 --> 00:43:40,297
and invented a new name.

556
00:43:40,908 --> 00:43:42,432
May l? Sure.

557
00:43:42,977 --> 00:43:44,444
That's...

558
00:43:48,316 --> 00:43:49,783
All right.

559
00:43:50,585 --> 00:43:54,146
Now I want to show you
something I showed you earlier.

560
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,614
From five years ago.

561
00:44:16,944 --> 00:44:20,505
That's not Peter Ward. That's...

562
00:44:22,483 --> 00:44:24,144
That's me.

563
00:44:25,887 --> 00:44:29,186
You lived in this institution
for five years, Peter.

564
00:44:39,267 --> 00:44:40,461
No.

565
00:44:43,638 --> 00:44:45,765
That's... That's ridiculous.

566
00:44:46,507 --> 00:44:49,101
I'm not Peter Ward. I'm Will Atenton.

567
00:44:50,144 --> 00:44:52,237
That's the name you gave yourself.

568
00:44:52,313 --> 00:44:55,612
W1-1L becomes Will.

569
00:44:56,784 --> 00:44:59,150
The numbers
8-10-10

570
00:44:59,687 --> 00:45:01,382
become Atenton.

571
00:45:02,223 --> 00:45:04,919
Will Atenton.

572
00:45:09,864 --> 00:45:12,298
I don't believe any of this.

573
00:45:12,366 --> 00:45:14,561
You're a danger to yourself.

574
00:45:15,536 --> 00:45:17,197
And to others.

575
00:45:18,706 --> 00:45:22,472
I'm sure the scar where your
wife shot you is still there.

576
00:45:24,645 --> 00:45:26,237
That would...

577
00:45:30,084 --> 00:45:32,143
That would mean that...

578
00:46:06,254 --> 00:46:07,414
No.

579
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,593
I left my wife and my
family at home this morning.

580
00:46:16,931 --> 00:46:19,525
You murdered your wife and family

581
00:46:20,268 --> 00:46:21,929
five years ago.

582
00:46:30,444 --> 00:46:32,469
You're a fucking liar!

583
00:46:33,948 --> 00:46:35,210
All right, move in.

584
00:46:35,883 --> 00:46:37,111
McNulty, get in here.

585
00:46:39,487 --> 00:46:40,818
Oh, nice.

586
00:46:49,964 --> 00:46:51,556
Hello? Hi.

587
00:46:53,935 --> 00:46:56,335
Hi. Where are you?

588
00:46:57,438 --> 00:46:59,929
Nothing. Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.

589
00:47:07,515 --> 00:47:09,244
I love you, Libby.

590
00:47:11,052 --> 00:47:12,383
I love you.

591
00:47:12,453 --> 00:47:15,422
Will you just hold on
just a minute, please?

592
00:47:17,391 --> 00:47:18,949
Would you like to talk to my wife?

593
00:47:19,727 --> 00:47:20,955
No.

594
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,931
Doesn't matter.

595
00:47:27,268 --> 00:47:28,530
No, no.

596
00:47:33,207 --> 00:47:35,835
No, we'll sort it out
when I get home. It's...

597
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:47,448
Will!

598
00:47:47,521 --> 00:47:48,681
Mr. A?

599
00:47:53,628 --> 00:47:54,788
How's the novel?

600
00:47:54,862 --> 00:47:55,988
Am I in it?

601
00:47:57,398 --> 00:47:58,865
I knew he'd be back.

602
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:02,292
The even numbers always come back.

603
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,867
Will... Will...

604
00:51:16,297 --> 00:51:18,390
Thanks for the flowers.

605
00:51:38,919 --> 00:51:41,012
Tell us a story, Daddy.

606
00:51:45,993 --> 00:51:47,961
Once upon a time,

607
00:51:50,464 --> 00:51:52,796
there were two little girls.

608
00:51:55,169 --> 00:51:57,501
And they lived in a house...

609
00:51:58,572 --> 00:52:00,335
In the forest.

610
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:04,739
...in a forest.

611
00:52:05,412 --> 00:52:07,004
By a stream.

612
00:52:08,015 --> 00:52:10,279
And they had a beautiful garden,

613
00:52:10,351 --> 00:52:12,683
with some beautiful flowers in it.

614
00:52:13,387 --> 00:52:16,652
Dee Dee, do you remember
the names of the flowers?

615
00:52:17,892 --> 00:52:19,792
Sunflowers!

616
00:52:20,427 --> 00:52:21,951
Marigolds.

617
00:52:23,731 --> 00:52:24,925
And tulips.

618
00:52:24,999 --> 00:52:27,433
Two lips! One, two.

619
00:52:28,636 --> 00:52:29,933
Stop it.

620
00:52:33,908 --> 00:52:35,341
Will, are you okay?

621
00:52:38,512 --> 00:52:39,706
Will?

622
00:52:44,919 --> 00:52:46,477
Are you okay?

623
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:49,184
What's the...

624
00:52:49,256 --> 00:52:51,850
Sweetie, you are seriously hot.

625
00:52:54,662 --> 00:52:57,256
You've got a fever. You're not well.

626
00:52:58,098 --> 00:52:59,292
Daddy, what's wrong?

627
00:52:59,366 --> 00:53:00,390
Daddy's not well.

628
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:02,662
Listen, why don't you girls go play,

629
00:53:02,736 --> 00:53:04,931
and we'll finish dinner later on, okay?

630
00:53:05,005 --> 00:53:06,063
All right?

631
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:09,234
I'm just gonna talk to
Daddy for a little bit.

632
00:53:09,643 --> 00:53:10,701
Stay there!

633
00:53:12,913 --> 00:53:15,473
I'm just
gonna talk to Daddy, okay?

634
00:53:18,852 --> 00:53:21,252
What happened to you at Greenhaven?

635
00:53:24,925 --> 00:53:26,790
They told me that...

636
00:53:31,131 --> 00:53:33,463
They told me that
you're not really here.

637
00:53:36,737 --> 00:53:38,864
Okay, Will, now you...

638
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:43,941
You're really scaring me.

639
00:53:44,878 --> 00:53:46,812
I'm not Will Atenton.

640
00:53:48,048 --> 00:53:49,481
I'm...

641
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:53,687
I'm Peter Ward.

642
00:53:55,889 --> 00:53:57,584
Do not say that.

643
00:53:59,393 --> 00:54:00,826
You have a fever,

644
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:03,491
and this is the fever talking.

645
00:54:08,302 --> 00:54:09,564
Okay?

646
00:54:10,104 --> 00:54:11,969
Come here. Come on.

647
00:54:17,077 --> 00:54:19,375
Come here, baby.
Daddy's not feeling well.

648
00:54:27,154 --> 00:54:28,314
Tell me your name.

649
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:32,391
Your real name, not your nickname.

650
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,224
Beatrice. We leave off the front.

651
00:54:49,143 --> 00:54:51,043
Okay, here we go.

652
00:54:53,781 --> 00:54:55,715
And what's your real name?

653
00:54:56,016 --> 00:54:57,677
It begins with a "K."

654
00:54:58,686 --> 00:55:01,120
Katherine. Katie.

655
00:55:01,822 --> 00:55:03,653
We used to call her Tee Tee.

656
00:55:03,891 --> 00:55:06,223
Now everybody calls her Dee Dee.

657
00:55:07,428 --> 00:55:09,157
And you're Libby.

658
00:55:10,831 --> 00:55:12,890
You're Elizabeth Ward.

659
00:55:21,608 --> 00:55:23,803
Okay, girls. Upstairs.

660
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:29,249
I'll be up in a minute.

661
00:55:29,683 --> 00:55:31,014
Come on.

662
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,524
It's okay. You're gonna be all right.

663
00:55:48,335 --> 00:55:49,927
Take it easy.

664
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:00,840
It's just a fever.

665
00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:04,249
It's gonna pass.

666
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:22,134
Will!

667
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:34,579
Will, come here!

668
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,254
Oh, God. They've caught your fever!

669
00:56:50,597 --> 00:56:52,997
Come here, baby. Are you okay?

670
00:56:54,334 --> 00:56:56,268
I can't breathe.

671
00:56:56,336 --> 00:56:57,598
You what?

672
00:56:57,671 --> 00:56:58,865
I can't...

673
00:56:58,939 --> 00:57:01,567
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

674
00:57:01,642 --> 00:57:03,109
Come here, come here.

675
00:57:03,177 --> 00:57:05,839
What is it? Tell me what's wrong.

676
00:57:07,681 --> 00:57:08,705
My throat hurts.

677
00:57:08,782 --> 00:57:09,771
Yeah?

678
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:10,908
I can't swallow.

679
00:57:11,285 --> 00:57:12,912
It's okay, I'm gonna
get you some medicine,

680
00:57:12,986 --> 00:57:15,454
and you're gonna feel okay in
a minute, all right?

681
00:57:15,522 --> 00:57:17,956
I can't breathe.

682
00:57:21,195 --> 00:57:23,459
I hurt my shoulder, too.

683
00:57:30,571 --> 00:57:34,302
Is this where it hurts? You wanna
show Mommy where it hurts? Where?

684
00:57:34,675 --> 00:57:36,142
Oh, my God.

685
00:57:36,844 --> 00:57:41,076
Oh, my God, there's a... She's
got... She's bleeding. She's got...

686
00:57:41,148 --> 00:57:42,479
She's got a bite here.

687
00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:44,210
Baby, we're gonna... It's
where she was shot, Libby.

688
00:57:44,284 --> 00:57:45,649
No, it's a...

689
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:47,016
It's where she was shot, Libby.

690
00:57:47,087 --> 00:57:48,145
It's a fever sore!

691
00:57:48,222 --> 00:57:49,621
It's where she was shot, Libby!

692
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:50,952
Stop saying that!

693
00:57:51,024 --> 00:57:53,891
There's a bullet
wound! Look at her back!

694
00:58:00,534 --> 00:58:01,865
Oh, my God.

695
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:07,197
Oh, God!

696
00:58:09,142 --> 00:58:10,541
Dee Dee?

697
00:58:12,546 --> 00:58:13,911
Dee Dee?

698
00:58:14,781 --> 00:58:17,181
Baby, come on. Dee Dee?

699
00:58:17,918 --> 00:58:19,215
Oh, God.

700
00:58:19,586 --> 00:58:22,783
Oh, God, she's so cold, Will.
Will, please do something.

701
00:58:22,856 --> 00:58:25,518
She's... She's not moving.
I need you to help, please.

702
00:58:25,592 --> 00:58:27,025
Please, she's not...

703
00:58:27,094 --> 00:58:29,460
What's going on? Dee Dee?

704
00:58:31,331 --> 00:58:33,993
Come on, Dee Dee. Dee Dee? Dee Dee?

705
00:58:34,067 --> 00:58:37,366
God, Will, she's cold. Trish? Trish?

706
00:58:38,005 --> 00:58:41,998
Trish, come on. Dee Dee.
Dee Dee, come on. Dee Dee?

707
00:58:43,076 --> 00:58:44,771
Why are you just standing there?

708
00:58:44,845 --> 00:58:47,177
Will, why are you just standing there?

709
00:58:47,247 --> 00:58:48,976
Wake up!

710
00:58:49,182 --> 00:58:51,673
Why won't you help your children?

711
00:58:51,752 --> 00:58:53,185
Will!

712
00:58:54,788 --> 00:58:55,948
Come on. Wake up!

713
00:58:56,023 --> 00:58:57,923
Libby, they're dead.

714
00:59:01,895 --> 00:59:03,624
You're dead.

715
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,801
Oh, please.

716
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:32,620
Yes, sir. Good evening.

717
00:59:32,693 --> 00:59:34,593
I wonder if youd take a
look at this for me, please?

718
00:59:43,003 --> 00:59:44,061
Thank you.

719
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:49,865
This is my home.

720
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,770
But it's not...

721
00:59:52,746 --> 00:59:54,873
It's not fit for habitation, Mr. Ward.

722
00:59:54,948 --> 00:59:55,937
Okay, let's go.

723
00:59:56,016 --> 00:59:57,643
Board it up now!

724
00:59:58,285 --> 00:59:59,809
Libby! Libby!

725
01:00:03,023 --> 01:00:04,718
Look out, buddy.

726
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:06,316
Libby!

727
01:00:07,494 --> 01:00:08,518
I'm sorry, sir.

728
01:00:14,368 --> 01:00:16,336
Did you do this?

729
01:00:18,572 --> 01:00:20,472
You don't remember me.

730
01:00:23,677 --> 01:00:25,907
Yeah, I remember you were...

731
01:00:27,614 --> 01:00:29,206
You were here.

732
01:00:30,751 --> 01:00:32,548
And you were at Greenhaven...

733
01:00:39,192 --> 01:00:41,092
You really see them.

734
01:00:42,696 --> 01:00:44,323
They're there.

735
01:00:44,865 --> 01:00:46,799
Look. Look!

736
01:00:51,171 --> 01:00:54,038
They're buried at New Ashford Cemetery.

737
01:01:31,778 --> 01:01:32,802
What are you doing?

738
01:01:32,879 --> 01:01:34,244
Trying to get into my house.

739
01:01:34,314 --> 01:01:35,406
Can't let you do that.

740
01:01:35,649 --> 01:01:37,640
This house is condemned,
buddy, can't let anyone in here.

741
01:01:43,256 --> 01:01:44,621
Have you been watching me?

742
01:01:44,691 --> 01:01:47,751
Goddamn right I have. You're a killer.

743
01:01:47,828 --> 01:01:49,455
Now get out of here.

744
01:01:54,201 --> 01:01:55,463
Go on. Get out of here.

745
01:02:52,092 --> 01:02:54,492
Where were you that night?

746
01:02:57,264 --> 01:03:00,358
I was alone, here at the house.

747
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:07,970
I was supposed to go out, but it was

748
01:03:08,842 --> 01:03:09,900
snowing.

749
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:12,908
Chloe was with her father, thank God.

750
01:03:12,979 --> 01:03:15,072
Why did you visit me in Greenhaven?

751
01:03:16,683 --> 01:03:20,141
Because I was your neighbor
from across the street.

752
01:03:20,787 --> 01:03:23,153
Libby was my best friend.

753
01:03:23,223 --> 01:03:25,248
Why didn't you tell me who I was?

754
01:03:25,325 --> 01:03:26,758
I wanted to,

755
01:03:27,561 --> 01:03:30,826
but you told me you were Will
Atenton. What was I gonna say?

756
01:03:33,466 --> 01:03:35,058
Did I do it?

757
01:03:36,436 --> 01:03:37,926
No.

758
01:03:39,072 --> 01:03:40,471
How do you know?

759
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:42,167
I just know.

760
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:44,536
Mom?

761
01:03:51,952 --> 01:03:53,681
Hey, honey. Hi.

762
01:03:55,121 --> 01:03:56,452
Hi.

763
01:04:00,994 --> 01:04:03,189
You... You need a bath.

764
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:06,996
Yeah.

765
01:04:07,067 --> 01:04:10,002
I guess I'll run him a bath.

766
01:04:15,442 --> 01:04:16,704
So,

767
01:04:17,777 --> 01:04:20,109
Mom says you see them.

768
01:04:21,615 --> 01:04:22,946
Yeah.

769
01:04:24,884 --> 01:04:26,146
Are they older?

770
01:04:28,288 --> 01:04:29,880
No, they're not.

771
01:04:31,258 --> 01:04:33,385
Could you tell them
how much I miss them?

772
01:04:40,033 --> 01:04:41,295
I will.

773
01:04:44,237 --> 01:04:46,296
Did you leave the plant?

774
01:04:47,107 --> 01:04:49,667
Yeah. It was the anniversary.

775
01:04:51,344 --> 01:04:52,333
Do you water it?

776
01:04:52,412 --> 01:04:53,811
Yeah, I do.

777
01:04:59,052 --> 01:05:00,383
Go get in the car, honey.

778
01:05:00,453 --> 01:05:01,579
Okay.

779
01:05:01,655 --> 01:05:02,747
Bye.

780
01:05:02,822 --> 01:05:03,811
Bye.

781
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:07,087
The water is running.
I left some towels.

782
01:05:09,029 --> 01:05:10,519
Don't go anywhere.

783
01:05:10,597 --> 01:05:12,121
Thank you.

784
01:05:20,206 --> 01:05:21,537
Are you okay? Yeah.

785
01:05:26,913 --> 01:05:28,813
Don't tell your father.

786
01:06:02,782 --> 01:06:04,079
Will?

787
01:06:11,591 --> 01:06:12,922
Yes.

788
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,957
I'll be down now.

789
01:06:22,802 --> 01:06:23,962
Mom.

790
01:06:25,939 --> 01:06:27,566
Oh, damn it.

791
01:06:28,108 --> 01:06:30,099
What are you doing here?

792
01:06:31,077 --> 01:06:32,339
I've heard Peter Ward's
been in our house.

793
01:06:32,412 --> 01:06:33,401
No, he's not.

794
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,210
And it's not our house. It's my house.

795
01:06:37,016 --> 01:06:38,040
Come on, Chloe. Get your stuff.

796
01:06:38,118 --> 01:06:39,380
She's not yours till Friday.

797
01:06:39,452 --> 01:06:41,420
She's in danger. He's a psychopath.

798
01:06:41,488 --> 01:06:43,752
What are you talking
about, Jack? Just go.

799
01:06:49,662 --> 01:06:50,686
Chloe...

800
01:06:50,764 --> 01:06:52,857
No, it's fine, Mom. I'll go.

801
01:06:52,932 --> 01:06:54,957
Honey, you don't have to go.

802
01:06:55,034 --> 01:06:57,002
No, it's okay. It's fine.

803
01:06:57,871 --> 01:06:59,361
Good girl.

804
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:02,667
You're such an asshole.

805
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:05,610
Chloe! Where are you...

806
01:07:05,678 --> 01:07:06,702
She's upset.

807
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,179
What do you expect?

808
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:12,943
Ann, I shouldn't even
be here. I'm sorry.

809
01:07:13,353 --> 01:07:15,685
It's not your fault.
He's just... Chloe!

810
01:07:16,856 --> 01:07:19,416
Look, I should go after her.

811
01:07:19,793 --> 01:07:23,456
But I found this in the laundry.

812
01:07:24,497 --> 01:07:28,228
Dr. Greeley. She treated
you at Greenhaven.

813
01:07:28,301 --> 01:07:29,359
Thank you.

814
01:07:29,636 --> 01:07:31,729
I think you should call her.

815
01:07:34,808 --> 01:07:36,207
Chloe!

816
01:07:40,547 --> 01:07:42,208
Chloe!

817
01:07:42,882 --> 01:07:44,406
Chloe!

818
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:48,516
Why did you release me?

819
01:07:49,389 --> 01:07:52,415
I had no choice. There was
no evidence against you.

820
01:07:52,892 --> 01:07:55,053
So I needed to let you go.

821
01:07:58,097 --> 01:07:59,291
How's the book?

822
01:07:59,766 --> 01:08:00,858
I'm not writing a book.

823
01:08:00,934 --> 01:08:03,095
I'm living in a fantasy
and walking around my house,

824
01:08:03,169 --> 01:08:04,898
talking to the walls.

825
01:08:05,572 --> 01:08:08,006
Perhaps it's your mind
trying to protect itself.

826
01:08:08,475 --> 01:08:09,567
From what?

827
01:08:09,943 --> 01:08:13,709
Their deaths. Or, the truth.

828
01:08:14,581 --> 01:08:15,707
You think I did it?

829
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:19,784
I honestly don't know.

830
01:08:20,186 --> 01:08:21,881
I don't care what my
mind's trying to do.

831
01:08:21,955 --> 01:08:25,152
I just have to find out who killed
my family, even if it was me.

832
01:08:26,426 --> 01:08:28,326
If you would admit yourself here now

833
01:08:28,394 --> 01:08:30,794
under my care, I can treat you.

834
01:08:30,897 --> 01:08:31,921
You're not well, Peter.

835
01:08:31,998 --> 01:08:33,022
Mmm.

836
01:08:33,933 --> 01:08:35,332
No, I'm not.

837
01:09:56,683 --> 01:09:59,015
Oh, I hate it when you leave!

838
01:10:00,553 --> 01:10:01,542
Look.

839
01:10:02,755 --> 01:10:04,222
I'm gonna beat you! Come on!

840
01:10:05,291 --> 01:10:07,589
The girls have been waiting for you.

841
01:10:12,031 --> 01:10:13,999
I love you. Sleep tight.

842
01:10:14,067 --> 01:10:15,500
Night, Daddy.

843
01:10:26,446 --> 01:10:29,040
Tell me what you know about that night.

844
01:10:29,115 --> 01:10:30,810
I don't wanna do this.

845
01:10:32,151 --> 01:10:34,642
You remembered where you were shot.

846
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:40,118
I remember I heard someone
on the stairs and I came out.

847
01:10:40,493 --> 01:10:41,551
I can't do this!

848
01:10:41,995 --> 01:10:43,758
You heard somebody on the stairs.

849
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:46,355
And I came out because
I knew it was you.

850
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:49,959
And then I fell.

851
01:10:50,303 --> 01:10:51,292
And...

852
01:10:56,476 --> 01:10:58,239
The kids were

853
01:10:59,445 --> 01:11:02,676
lying there and they were so still.

854
01:11:04,951 --> 01:11:06,612
And I knew they were going away,

855
01:11:06,686 --> 01:11:11,089
and I knew they needed me to take
care of them, so I went with them.

856
01:11:13,493 --> 01:11:15,120
And then...

857
01:11:21,234 --> 01:11:22,758
And then...

858
01:11:25,271 --> 01:11:29,037
I found those flowers, and
I was painting the front hall

859
01:11:29,108 --> 01:11:30,939
and it was snowing, and I was worried

860
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:33,240
you wouldn't make it home, but you did.

861
01:11:36,683 --> 01:11:38,674
What else? What else do you remember?

862
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,719
I don't remember anything.

863
01:11:42,488 --> 01:11:44,581
I don't remember anything.

864
01:11:44,657 --> 01:11:46,682
You shot me. You shot me.

865
01:11:46,759 --> 01:11:48,454
No. You shot me!

866
01:11:48,528 --> 01:11:51,520
No, I shot the man who shot the girls.

867
01:11:51,597 --> 01:11:52,825
You shot me.

868
01:11:52,899 --> 01:11:54,366
No.

869
01:11:56,936 --> 01:11:58,335
What is that?

870
01:12:01,074 --> 01:12:02,507
It's a scar.

871
01:12:07,013 --> 01:12:08,344
Why?

872
01:12:11,684 --> 01:12:13,515
Forgive me.

873
01:12:18,658 --> 01:12:20,956
Peter? Peter, are you there?

874
01:12:37,276 --> 01:12:38,265
Peter?

875
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:41,811
You have to get out of here. What?

876
01:12:44,984 --> 01:12:46,849
You're gonna tell me the truth.

877
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,514
I tried to tell you in Greenhaven.

878
01:12:48,588 --> 01:12:49,612
Tell me what?

879
01:12:49,689 --> 01:12:50,713
Everything.

880
01:12:51,424 --> 01:12:54,325
Libby, the children, they're gone.

881
01:12:54,393 --> 01:12:56,520
Libby is dead,

882
01:12:56,896 --> 01:12:59,421
and you need to let them go.

883
01:13:01,868 --> 01:13:04,336
It was a mistake coming back here.

884
01:13:05,071 --> 01:13:07,096
You can't stay in this house, Peter.

885
01:13:08,141 --> 01:13:09,733
It'll drive you crazy.

886
01:13:12,278 --> 01:13:13,745
How did she die, Ann?

887
01:13:15,148 --> 01:13:16,945
Tell me how she died.

888
01:13:22,054 --> 01:13:23,715
Libby loved you.

889
01:13:27,794 --> 01:13:29,785
She'd want you to let her go.

890
01:13:35,168 --> 01:13:37,432
You have to let her go now, Peter.

891
01:13:40,273 --> 01:13:42,537
Hey. Where are you?

892
01:13:42,675 --> 01:13:45,143
I heard you come in.
Is that you downstairs?

893
01:13:45,945 --> 01:13:47,037
I'm outside the house.

894
01:13:47,113 --> 01:13:48,410
Uh-huh.

895
01:13:48,481 --> 01:13:49,709
Daddy's home.

896
01:13:53,286 --> 01:13:54,344
Who are you?

897
01:13:56,055 --> 01:13:57,044
Shh!

898
01:13:57,356 --> 01:13:58,914
Mommy? Come on,
I heard you downstairs.

899
01:13:58,991 --> 01:14:00,788
What? You're a liar. What?

900
01:14:05,398 --> 01:14:06,422
Libby?

901
01:14:06,499 --> 01:14:08,262
Okay, kids, don't move, don't move.

902
01:14:08,401 --> 01:14:10,164
Mommy? It's gonna be okay.

903
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:11,559
Libby?

904
01:14:11,637 --> 01:14:12,661
Put down the gun, please.

905
01:14:13,739 --> 01:14:15,001
Libby?

906
01:14:16,809 --> 01:14:18,504
Put the gun down, please.

907
01:14:18,578 --> 01:14:19,738
Libby!

908
01:14:23,983 --> 01:14:25,848
Run! Daddy!

909
01:14:26,752 --> 01:14:27,844
Daddy!

910
01:14:58,484 --> 01:14:59,644
I didn't do it.

911
01:15:02,755 --> 01:15:03,949
I didn't.

912
01:15:10,529 --> 01:15:12,190
Hello, Peter Ward.

913
01:15:13,799 --> 01:15:14,993
Jack?

914
01:15:17,069 --> 01:15:18,696
Why don't you...

915
01:15:19,005 --> 01:15:20,939
Why don't you put that thing down

916
01:15:21,007 --> 01:15:22,201
and we can have a conversation?

917
01:15:25,878 --> 01:15:27,311
Peter!

918
01:15:28,748 --> 01:15:30,613
Jack, you killed them.

919
01:15:30,783 --> 01:15:31,977
It was supposed to be you.

920
01:15:33,219 --> 01:15:34,345
Stop!

921
01:15:39,792 --> 01:15:41,987
Get the chloroform! Now!

922
01:16:03,983 --> 01:16:06,315
It should've been so simple.

923
01:16:06,919 --> 01:16:09,888
I went to the wrong
goddamn house. It was a mistake.

924
01:16:09,956 --> 01:16:11,924
We put them in the basement.

925
01:16:42,025 --> 01:16:43,492
I'm sick of your shit.

926
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:46,185
You've tormented me
for five goddamn years.

927
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,794
Child killer.

928
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:04,969
Come on.

929
01:17:06,817 --> 01:17:08,375
You'll never collect.

930
01:17:09,086 --> 01:17:11,384
Chloe collects, I collect.

931
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,348
You took everything. My
money, my house, my kid!

932
01:17:47,624 --> 01:17:49,649
And now that Ward's back,

933
01:17:51,128 --> 01:17:52,720
I get another shot.

934
01:18:38,575 --> 01:18:39,735
Peter.

935
01:18:54,457 --> 01:18:55,481
Peter?

936
01:18:57,394 --> 01:19:00,488
Peter! Wake up, Peter!

937
01:19:36,166 --> 01:19:37,326
Okay, Ward!

938
01:19:42,639 --> 01:19:45,335
Peter. Peter.

939
01:19:48,878 --> 01:19:50,778
You're all right. You're
all right. You're okay.

940
01:20:51,941 --> 01:20:52,930
Are you okay?

941
01:20:53,576 --> 01:20:55,373
Yes. Chloe!

942
01:20:56,313 --> 01:20:59,146
Mom! Mom!

943
01:21:02,752 --> 01:21:04,117
Oh, baby.

944
01:21:08,992 --> 01:21:10,960
Peter, no!

945
01:21:18,068 --> 01:21:21,003
Libby! Libby!

946
01:21:31,147 --> 01:21:33,274
What are you doing? Get out of here.

947
01:21:34,751 --> 01:21:36,480
I don't wanna lose you.

948
01:21:38,254 --> 01:21:42,281
I know, but you have to go.

949
01:22:03,346 --> 01:22:04,643
You be good.

950
01:22:04,714 --> 01:22:06,238
We love you, Daddy.

951
01:22:33,109 --> 01:22:34,667
I love you.

952
01:22:36,713 --> 01:22:38,442
I love you.

953
01:22:43,586 --> 01:22:45,110
I'll always be with you.

954
01:22:45,722 --> 01:22:47,189
I know.

955
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
But you know that.

956
01:23:31,034 --> 01:23:32,058
Is there anybody else inside?

957
01:23:32,135 --> 01:23:33,363
No.

958
01:23:33,436 --> 01:23:35,301
You okay? Yeah.
