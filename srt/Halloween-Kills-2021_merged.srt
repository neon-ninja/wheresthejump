00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:06,240
Doctor, get back in the car!

3
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:08,076
No! No.

4
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:10,453
I'm still gonna blow
this motherfucker's brains out.

5
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:14,499
Mom! Mom!

6
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,542
Help!

7
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:28,137
Pick up.

8
00:01:29,305 --> 00:01:30,848
Pick up.

9
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,434
Dude, where are you?

10
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:34,769
Hey there, sassy lovers.

11
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:36,437
- This is Oscar.
- Damn it.

12
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,106
I am unable to take
your call right now

13
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:39,649
because I'm standing right...

14
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:41,109
behind you!

15
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,362
Hey, Oscar, uh, call me
wh-when you get this.

16
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,824
Um, I messed up
with Allyson, man.

17
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:50,451
I got to find her and, uh,
fix it somehow,

18
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:52,912
so, uh, if you know where she is

19
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:55,665
or if you guys are together,
let me know.

20
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:58,710
All right. Be safe. Bye.

21
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:04,257
Damn it!

22
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:12,765
Dude, you okay?

23
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:16,686
Hey! You okay?

24
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:20,565
Hey.

25
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:25,528
Hey, man, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

26
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:27,363
Oh, no.

27
00:02:27,405 --> 00:02:29,365
Oh, my God. Okay.

28
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:32,535
Okay.

29
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:35,371
Help! Help!

30
00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:37,457
Oh, shit. Help!

31
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:39,334
Somebody help!

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Okay, okay.
All right.
All right.
Um, okay, okay, okay.

33
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:49,218
Okay. All right, man.

34
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,179
Come on. Come on,
look at me, look at me.

35
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,472
Stay with me, stay with me.

36
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:53,848
Hawkins, Officer Hawkins.

37
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,017
Okay. Look at me, look at me.
You're good.

38
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:58,603
Hold on tight.
I'm gonna get help, okay?

39
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,064
- Help! Help!
- He needs to die.

40
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,691
He needs to die.

41
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,568
Okay, okay.
Come on, come on.

42
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,944
Stay still, stay still,
stay still. Look at me.

43
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,529
- Look at... Look at me.
- He needs to die.

44
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:09,947
Who needs to die?

45
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,075
He needs to die.

46
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:13,785
And I'm the one...

47
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,995
that's gonna get him.

48
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:23,795
Oh, shit.

49
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,547
Haddonfield
Sheriff's Department.

50
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,758
Stop right there.

51
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:34,931
I said stop!

52
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,610
Shit.

53
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:51,948
Shit.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hawkins! You all right?

55
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:09,132
Did you see him?

56
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:11,009
- Where did he go?
- Where have you guys been?

57
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,552
I called for backup
ten minutes ago.

58
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:14,095
Easy, rookie.

59
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:15,930
Loomis said he shot him
multiple times in the chest.

60
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:17,432
I saw from 50 yards away.

61
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:20,685
He crossed right here
and then just disappeared.

62
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,478
Okay. Sullivan, you and Tobias

63
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,022
search Chestnut,
south to the bypass.

64
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,149
Hawkins and I will track
Market Street up to Lampkin.

65
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,191
We'll catch him.

66
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,277
Yeah, kill the bad guy.

67
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,863
Jesus, Frank.

68
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,740
I used to know the guy.

69
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:35,950
- Michael. We were kids.
- Yeah?

70
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:38,119
Was he one of those
weirdo freaks who used to pluck

71
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:40,538
the wings off butterflies
when he was a kid?

72
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,582
Not that I ever saw.

73
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,292
He was just...

74
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:46,461
Just killed his sister
when he was six years old?

75
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:49,505
Yeah. My mom used to make me
go over to his house to play.

76
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:52,008
She felt bad. But he would just
spend the whole time

77
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,761
staring out of his sister's
bedroom window.

78
00:04:54,802 --> 00:04:56,804
I always remember thinking,

79
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:59,307
"The hell is he looking at
out there?"

80
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:02,810
He was looking at Haddonfield.

81
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:06,147
Simple town where
nothing exciting ever happens.

82
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:07,732
Yeah.

83
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,693
Then one day, he just snapped.

84
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,829
Lonnie, Lonnie, weird and scrawny.

85
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:24,499
Has bad dreams,
so cries to mommy.

86
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,084
He's gonna get you.

87
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,503
He's gonna get you, Lonnie.
He's gonna get you.

88
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:29,796
Touch Conrad's candy again,

89
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:31,255
I swear to God
I'll beat your ugly ass!

90
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,507
Yeah, we'll beat your
ugly ass. That's right!

91
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,008
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

92
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,718
- It was Richie.
- Then show me.

93
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,220
Open your hand right now.

94
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:38,763
- No.
- Why don't you open up your hand?

95
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,056
I don't want to.

96
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,518
- Get off.
- Open your hand!

97
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:46,145
Leave me alone.

98
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,232
Yeah, okay.

99
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:53,820
That's what you get when
you fuck with the Mullanys.

100
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:56,322
Get away from me!
Leave me alone!

101
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,035
Hey. Everything all right
with you kids?

102
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:03,788
Yeah. Just trick-or-treating
with our new old friend Lonnie.

103
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,373
What? You...

104
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:07,750
You kids see anyone
walking around in a white mask?

105
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:10,128
It's Halloween.
Everyone's wearing a mask.

106
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,255
That's right. I need you
to go home right now.

107
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:14,716
Go home to your parents
and lock your doors.

108
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:16,968
- Why? What did he do?
- What did he do?

109
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,553
He murdered three teenagers
down the street.

110
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,394
Don't get murdered, Lonnie.

111
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:28,563
Sleep with one eye open, Lonnie.

112
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:30,231
He's gonna get you, Lonnie Elam!

113
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:32,400
- Boogey, Boogey.
- Did you see his face?

114
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,654
Lonnie, Lonnie,
weird and scrawny.

115
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,906
Has bad dreams,
so cries to mommy.

116
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,533
Be careful, Lonnie.

117
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:42,076
He's gonna get you,
Lonnie. He's gonna get you.

118
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:43,578
He's gonna get you, Lonnie.

119
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,288
Sleep with one eye open, Lonnie.

120
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,081
He's gonna get you, Lonnie.

121
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:49,334
He's gonna get you,
Lonnie Elam.

122
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:13,775
Help.

123
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:15,193
Help!

124
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,904
I'm sorry
for tripping Tommy Doyle

125
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:19,155
and bullying him.

126
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:22,116
Just... just-just please
don't kill me.

127
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:23,701
Hey, kid. You okay?

128
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,328
Hey, whoa. It's all right.
Take it easy.

129
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,663
Where'd he go?

130
00:07:26,704 --> 00:07:27,914
Where is he?

131
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:29,874
You-you didn't see him?

132
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,418
- Take a deep breath.
- Who?

133
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,462
The Boogeyman.

134
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,799
- He's gonna kill you!
- Whoa. Hey, hey.

135
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,801
- Boogeyman?
- What the hell?

136
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:41,302
That's it.

137
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,597
That's the Myers house.

138
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,975
That's where it happened.

139
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:50,144
Halloween, 1963.

140
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:22,385
Hey, Frank?

141
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:23,886
Yeah.

142
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:26,180
There's a dead dog in here.

143
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,348
What?

144
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,474
Nothing.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Don't shoot!

146
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:44,198
- Frank. Frank.
- What?

147
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,618
Oh, sh...

148
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:52,123
Go for it.

149
00:08:53,124 --> 00:08:56,252
Three, two, one.

150
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:00,923
Okay.

151
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:04,385
Crazy.

152
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:12,685
Ugh.

153
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:14,270
Spiderwebs.

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Haddonfield.
Where nothing exciting
ever happ...

155
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,457
McCabe?

156
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:22,630
McCabe?

157
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,549
McCabe!

158
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,138
Drop him!

159
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:31,723
Drop him or I'll shoot.

160
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,434
Michael, I'm warning you.

161
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:38,604
Goddamn it!

162
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,001
Hang on, McCabe.

163
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:01,669
Pete. Pete, Pete.

164
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:04,130
Hey, hey. It's-it's okay.

165
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:05,757
We're gonna get...

166
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,217
We're gonna get you some help,
okay? Just hang in there.

167
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:09,594
It's gonna be okay, all right?

168
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,012
You're gonna stay with me?

169
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:12,347
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Stay with me, okay?

170
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:13,514
Stay back! The evil is here!

171
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:16,517
Move, move, move!

172
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,852
- Freeze!
- Stop!

173
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:20,438
Michael, stay where you are.

174
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,023
You got him, right?

175
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:24,359
We... Tell me we got him.

176
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,777
Stay right there!

177
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,278
Uh-huh.

178
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:30,531
We got him?

179
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:32,825
Oh, my God.

180
00:11:36,454 --> 00:11:38,581
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,500
Sorry.

182
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,211
Oh, God.

183
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:49,884
Stop!

184
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:51,302
Michael, stay back.

185
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,054
Hold it right there!

186
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:54,389
...description of
the subject for confirmation.

187
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,849
- It's him.
- It's him.

188
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:58,434
It's Michael Myers.

189
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:05,233
Officer Hawkins, tell me,
what happened in here?

190
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:06,901
Tell me what happened.

191
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,403
Did Michael kill?

192
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:09,946
Did Michael kill again?

193
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:20,785
♪ Daddy don't take it hard ♪

194
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:24,872
♪ When you cry... ♪

195
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:26,874
I thought that was
gonna be, like,

196
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,209
a holiday pizza party

197
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:29,627
with a bunch of coworkers,
not an orgy.

198
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,963
Your vulgar-ass boss
acted inappropriately.

199
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,381
You need to start

200
00:14:33,423 --> 00:14:34,757
standing up for yourself
in these situations.

201
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,384
Yeah, no. That's right.
You're right.

202
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:37,885
No, stand up for myself.
Now, tomorrow morning,

203
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:39,554
I'm gonna go in there,
I'm gonna quit that job...

204
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:41,389
And you're gonna punch
Dr. Mathis in the face.

205
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:43,725
- Ooh! Champagne.
- Yep. Punch him in the face.

206
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,351
- Okay. - Yes!
- Oh, look at you.

207
00:14:45,393 --> 00:14:46,769
With all the shit
happening today,

208
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,563
two homicides at a gas station...

209
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:50,606
Stop it. We don't even
know if he was on the bus.

210
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:52,984
Tommy, you're so paranoid.

211
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,237
- Very sous bois.
- Mm, okay.

212
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,905
- Oh. Excuse me.
- Great.

213
00:14:57,947 --> 00:14:59,991
Yeah, that's...
that's a little old French term

214
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,617
meaning this bitch tastes good.

215
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:04,370
All right!

216
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:09,083
Hey. Hey.

217
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,210
Hey, hey, guys, guys, guys.

218
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:12,837
Can you bring it down a tad?

219
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,214
Like, my wife and I are trying
to watch the talent show.

220
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:16,799
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

221
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:18,593
- Sorry. - Yeah. Yeah, sorry.
- Sorry about that.

222
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:20,928
- Appreciate it.
- Okay.

223
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:24,098
I'm gonna go get us
a couple of drinks.

224
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,767
- You relax.
- Okay.

225
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:28,561
Well, I'm kind of a
sommelier, but for cheap wines.

226
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:30,938
- Yeah.
- Yeah, can I get, um,

227
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,607
two of the voodoo
skeleton thing right here?

228
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:34,901
Hey, look here, don't be
bothered by them motherfuckers

229
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:36,361
over there, man.

230
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,529
They are friends
with that crazy lady

231
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:41,282
that almost got killed
by Michael Myers.

232
00:15:41,324 --> 00:15:43,284
No shit.
I-I heard about that.

233
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:44,786
Wha...
Uh, Laura Stropes or something.

234
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:46,871
- Laurie Strode.
- Strode, yeah.

235
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,539
The one that survived
Michael Myers.

236
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,333
They come here every Halloween,

237
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,044
and, you know,
tears in their beers.

238
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,131
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to introduce

239
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,841
our next thespian.

240
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:03,096
Now, I used to bust this guy's
balls when we were kids,

241
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:05,014
but he is all grown-up now.

242
00:16:05,056 --> 00:16:10,269
And he's become the most
captivating bird whistler.

243
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:18,861
- Hey, everybody.
- All right, Tommy!

244
00:16:18,903 --> 00:16:21,197
Uh, Lonnie put me up
to this shit.

245
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:25,201
Uh, I'm not gonna
whistle for you.

246
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:26,703
I'm, uh... I'm gonna
tell you a story.

247
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:29,455
- Ghosts and goblins!
- Oh...

248
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:33,167
- You got this, Tommy!
- Turn off the lights!

249
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:36,838
Any of you know the story
of the Haddonfield Boogeyman?

250
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,508
Too young to give a shit?
Too drunk to remember?

251
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,346
40 years ago, a madman escaped
from a mental hospital.

252
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:47,390
It was the night
before Halloween,

253
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:49,225
and three teenage girls

254
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:51,144
were walking home
from Haddonfield High.

255
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:53,855
They had sightings of a...

256
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:57,525
a ghostlike figure creeping
right through our town.

257
00:16:57,567 --> 00:17:00,403
A man in a white mask.

258
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:03,323
Or was it more than a man?

259
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:05,742
He was watching them.

260
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:09,787
Before the night was over,
three people would be murdered.

261
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:13,458
And in the house next door,
there was a babysitter

262
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,960
and a young boy
and a young girl,

263
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:19,297
and they were brutally attacked
by this stalker

264
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:23,635
who had a power beyond
any mortal man.

265
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,181
My name is Tommy Doyle.

266
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,434
And I was that young boy.

267
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:35,188
So, please, join me

268
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:38,900
in commemorating the victims

269
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:42,737
and the survivors
of Michael Myers.

270
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:45,531
Thank you.

271
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:53,081
Now, we have, uh, the lovely
Miss Lindsey Wallace.

272
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:56,959
Her babysitter, Annie Brackett,
was executed that night.

273
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:07,011
And we have
Miss Marion Chambers.

274
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,680
She survived an assault.

275
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,810
We have Lonnie Elam.

276
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:16,813
Lonnie survived
a face-to-face encounter.

277
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,733
Help!

278
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,945
It's Halloween night
in Haddonfield.

279
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:27,490
When terror's
supposed to be fun.

280
00:18:27,532 --> 00:18:29,993
When we hide behind masks

281
00:18:30,034 --> 00:18:32,245
and we pretend
we aren't what we are.

282
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:34,122
Is he real?

283
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:35,957
Who knows?

284
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:37,959
Who's next?

285
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:42,505
Maybe not tonight,
maybe not tomorrow,

286
00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:44,632
but the Boogeyman
is coming for me.

287
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:46,759
And he's coming for you.

288
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:50,013
But he's not gonna get us.

289
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:51,514
Not this time.

290
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:55,143
Because we will never
succumb to fear.

291
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:56,477
This is for you, Laurie.

292
00:18:58,521 --> 00:18:59,856
Wherever you are.

293
00:18:59,897 --> 00:19:01,274
We're almost at
the hospital, Mom.

294
00:19:01,316 --> 00:19:03,026
Take deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

295
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:04,986
We're almost there.
We're almost at the hospital.

296
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:07,071
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

297
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,740
It's good. It's good.

298
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,491
It's okay. It's okay.

299
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,493
No, no, no, no.

300
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:15,580
- No, no, no, no, no!
- No!

301
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,957
Oh, let it burn!

302
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:19,542
No!

303
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,210
Let it burn!

304
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:24,881
Copy that.
Utilities are being shut down.

305
00:19:24,922 --> 00:19:27,842
We got a gas-fed fire in here.

306
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:29,469
Ten-four. Stand by.

307
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,054
Copy.

308
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:38,353
Assignment complete.

309
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,521
- Utilities are disengaged.
- Copy.

310
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:42,106
- Eyes on the roof.
- Watch out.

311
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:43,858
With you. Let's move.
All right, let's go.

312
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,194
Command Ladder 13, do you copy?

313
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:12,428
Mayday. Mayday.

314
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:15,890
Radio silence.
We have a Mayday alert.

315
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:17,684
This is Benton
with Engine Eight.

316
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:19,978
There's been
a structural collapse.

317
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,397
My air supply has been
compromised.

318
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:24,315
PASS alarm has been activated.

319
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,693
Oh, shit.

320
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:29,570
Come in, Engine 13.

321
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:32,657
Oh.
There's someone else down here!

322
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,742
Do you copy?

323
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:44,711
Central,
we have a firefighter down.

324
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:48,673
All right, team one,
commence rescue.

325
00:20:50,341 --> 00:20:51,801
Benton?

326
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:54,762
Benton, my hand's here!

327
00:20:54,804 --> 00:20:57,181
Take my hand!

328
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,017
Take my hand now!

329
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,269
Mayday event.
Send in rescue team now.

330
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,812
Grab my hand!

331
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:12,071
The fuck is that?

332
00:22:17,595 --> 00:22:19,347
Mom, can you hear us?

333
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:21,391
- All right.
- She was stabbed in the abdomen.

334
00:22:21,432 --> 00:22:23,393
Activate the trauma team.
We got an unconscious female

335
00:22:23,434 --> 00:22:25,311
- with an abdominal injury.
- Can you hear me, Mom?

336
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:26,688
Possibly penetrating,
multiple contusions.

337
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:27,897
Mom, can you hear me?

338
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:30,024
She's losing a lot of blood.

339
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:31,567
Ma'am, can you tell me
your name?

340
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:32,777
Allyson, wait here, honey.

341
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,821
Ma'am, can you tell me
your name?

342
00:22:34,862 --> 00:22:37,615
Um, uh, that's... that's my mom.

343
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:38,783
It's Laurie Strode.

344
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,910
- Strode. She was attacked.
- Laurie.

345
00:22:40,952 --> 00:22:42,370
She's, uh... she's my mom.

346
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:44,288
Sh-She's been attacked.
She has probably...

347
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,708
Ma'am, I-I think you should
really let a nurse look at you.

348
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:47,834
I'm fine.

349
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,128
I'm fine.

350
00:22:52,547 --> 00:22:54,257
It's not my blood.

351
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:55,633
Okay? It's not my blood.

352
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,260
We'll close up the fascia,

353
00:23:39,302 --> 00:23:42,180
and, uh, we'll loosely
staple the, uh, skin

354
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,848
so it doesn't get infected.

355
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:48,353
She's lost a good bit of blood,
but it's all controllable.

356
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,063
I think she'll be fine.

357
00:23:50,104 --> 00:23:53,941
Get her to the floor,
into the ICU tonight.

358
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:56,277
The internal organ
will be repaired,

359
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,863
and so there shouldn't be
any long-term damage.

360
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,490
Her only concern will be

361
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:03,284
her abdominal wall will be
very sore from the knife wound

362
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:05,828
and from our midline
incision here.

363
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,292
Thank you for everything.

364
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:13,252
Honey.

365
00:24:13,294 --> 00:24:14,837
Hey.

366
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:16,881
She's gonna be okay.

367
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,884
She's gonna be okay.

368
00:24:25,014 --> 00:24:27,183
Dad's gone.

369
00:24:30,812 --> 00:24:33,064
He'll always be with us.

370
00:24:34,023 --> 00:24:36,275
Even if we can't see him.

371
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,200
No, I'm not afraid to go.

372
00:24:44,242 --> 00:24:46,703
I just don't feel like it.

373
00:24:46,744 --> 00:24:48,788
Besides, I sort of promised
my father

374
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,998
we-we were going to the movies.

375
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,542
I don't hear
no more fire trucks.

376
00:24:54,043 --> 00:24:56,045
Goddamn sleep apnea mask
smells like Lucky Strikes

377
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:57,839
from when
your mother borrowed it.

378
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,507
I smell it, too.

379
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:00,967
But that stink ain't cigarettes.

380
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:02,510
That's Laurie Strode's
house on fire.

381
00:25:02,552 --> 00:25:05,972
Well, from-from upstairs,
it looks like they put it out.

382
00:25:06,014 --> 00:25:08,975
But that nut bag lives
a highly flammable lifestyle.

383
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:11,019
Better not talk no shit
about that woman.

384
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,438
She will fuck you up.

385
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,857
How about you and I
snack on some Cheez-Its

386
00:25:15,898 --> 00:25:19,110
and try a little
Beaujolais nouveau?

387
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,156
Cheap piece of shit.

388
00:25:23,197 --> 00:25:24,907
You don't know
how to fly that thing.

389
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:26,701
Give me that controller.

390
00:25:26,743 --> 00:25:28,953
Here, I got you.

391
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,501
The fuck was that?

392
00:25:35,543 --> 00:25:37,462
Somebody in there?

393
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,072
Hey!

394
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:12,121
You see anything?

395
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

396
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:33,935
Hey, Sondra. Sondra.

397
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:35,311
There's a big fella
in our bathroom,

398
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
and he's wearing a monster mask.
Well, what the fuck
does he want?
Who gives a shit?
Call the cops!

399
00:27:01,838 --> 00:27:04,257
Run, Sondra! Run!

400
00:27:16,185 --> 00:27:18,229
No.

401

Please no.

I got my bat up here.
Huckleberry.

442
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:38,221
- Old Huckleberry.
- Baseball bat. Excellent.

443
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:39,597
Oh, if he come back today,

462

This fugitive is on foot.

463
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:25,643
His name is Michael Myers.

464

...service station
earlier today.

472
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:50,710
This evening,
four bodies were discovered

473
00:31:50,752 --> 00:31:53,421
in three homes along
the same residential street.

474
00:31:53,463 --> 00:31:56,758
Residents of North Haddonfield
are on high alert.

475
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,593
- Officials are investigating.
- What's gonna stop him?

476
00:31:58,635 --> 00:32:00,011
Less than an hour ago,

477
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:02,472
Haddonfield authorities
positively identified...

478
00:32:02,513 --> 00:32:03,765
- That's our street.
- ...several more victims

479
00:32:03,806 --> 00:32:05,933
in this
South Bastick neighborhood.

480
00:32:05,975 --> 00:32:08,102
That reporter is right
outside Mrs. Dewbottom's house.

481
00:32:08,144 --> 00:32:09,437
That's right next door
to our house.

482
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,897
...two patients of the local

483
00:32:10,938 --> 00:32:12,940
Smith's Grove State Hospital
unaccounted for

484
00:32:12,982 --> 00:32:14,942
after yesterday's
transport bus escape.

485
00:32:14,984 --> 00:32:17,111
Authorities have not
confirmed a connection

486
00:32:17,153 --> 00:32:20,531
between those two events,
but police are encouraging

487
00:32:20,573 --> 00:32:22,742
all residents to remain inside

488
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,370
until further information
is released.

489
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:28,498
Tonight's tragedy
an eerie reminder of an event

490
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:30,375
in Haddonfield history

491
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,960
this community has spent
decades trying to forget.

492
00:32:33,002 --> 00:32:34,837
But police now believe
that more people...

493
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:37,256
I-I remember him
from 40 years ago.

494
00:32:37,298 --> 00:32:39,634
I was laying in my bed,
and he...

495
00:32:39,676 --> 00:32:42,136
he stabbed... he...
he killed her.

496
00:32:42,178 --> 00:32:43,721
That's-that's Julian.
That's that...

497
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:45,765
That's that little asshole kid
from across the street.

498
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:47,976
And she was my number-one
main best babysitter.

499
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:49,978
Yeah, we're gonna go, all right?

500
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:51,521
Uh, hey, thanks, man.

501
00:32:51,562 --> 00:32:53,648
Um, it was nice meeting
you guys, but we got to go.

502
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,483
- Be careful.
- Oh, y'all be careful, now.

503
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:57,568
What the hell is happening?

504
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,987
It's Michael. It's got to be.

505
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:00,738
I've lived here my whole life.

506
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,032
This was a safe place,
and now it's not anymore.

507
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,706
Shit. I forgot my stethoscope.

508
00:33:09,747 --> 00:33:11,165
Come on, baby,
we got to get home.

509
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:13,668
I bet that lady still has it.
Hey, I'll be right back.

510
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

511
00:33:35,898 --> 00:33:37,150
What?

512
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:40,570
What's wrong?

513
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:41,904
Baby. Baby, baby.

514
00:33:41,946 --> 00:33:43,197
- What? What? What's wrong?
- He's in the car.

515
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:44,532
- What?
- He's in the car.

516
00:33:44,574 --> 00:33:45,867
- Who? What?
- He's in the back seat.

517
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,201
Michael Myers is
in the back seat. Go look.

518
00:33:47,243 --> 00:33:48,202
Go look? Hell no!

519
00:33:48,244 --> 00:33:50,038
What's wrong with you?

520
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:54,709
Somebody help me.
He's here.

521
00:33:54,751 --> 00:33:55,960
He's in the back seat of my car.

522
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:57,545
I saw him when I went
to go get in.

523
00:33:57,587 --> 00:33:59,047
It's the same guy
you were talking about...

524
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:00,590
the one that that was on TV.

525
00:34:00,631 --> 00:34:01,966
Tommy, what are you doing?

526
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:04,218
That nasty snatcher's
in my parking lot?

527
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,887
Yes, sir.

528
00:34:05,928 --> 00:34:07,597
Love lives today.

529
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:09,140
But evil dies tonight.

530
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:13,895
Tommy Doyle's gonna fuck him up.

531
00:34:13,936 --> 00:34:15,396
He's right there, in my car.

532
00:34:15,438 --> 00:34:17,357
He, uh... he got out of the car

533
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:19,776
and got into the front
of the car.

534
00:34:19,817 --> 00:34:22,320
I saw him.
He looked right at me.

535
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:41,047
Is it him?

536
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:42,799
He's watching us.

537
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:48,388
I got this.

538
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,556

I thought we were gonna
watch a movie.

00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,210
No.

580
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:25,461
Fuck that.

581
00:37:25,503 --> 00:37:26,963
It's Halloween.

582
00:37:27,005 --> 00:37:29,298
Pulled some old spooky records.

583
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,092
Want to get high and dance?

584
00:37:31,134 --> 00:37:32,260
It's tempting.

585
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:36,764
Little late
for trick-or-treaters.

586
00:37:39,142 --> 00:37:41,769
- Argh, matey.
- Me and my sister were trick-or-treating,

587
00:37:41,811 --> 00:37:43,938
and, uh, we got candy bars
from your house,

588
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,524
and when she bit into it,
there was a rusty razor blade.

589
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:48,359
Wha... All right.
Calm down, calm down.

590
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:49,819
Now, where is she?

591
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:52,113
She's right, um... there.

592
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:55,575
Big John!

593
00:37:55,616 --> 00:37:57,160
Big John, come quick!

594
00:37:57,201 --> 00:37:58,828
What, what, what, what?

595
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,663
- What's happened?
- She's bleeding.

596
00:38:00,705 --> 00:38:02,707
She swallowed a razor blade.
She's still alive.

597
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Call 911.
- Can you help her?
- Oh.
- She bit her tongue off.
- She's bleeding to death.
- Okay, there's the blade.
It's in the barf.

598
00:38:12,342 --> 00:38:13,968
The fuck was that?

599
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,803
Did someone just go
in our house?

600
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, my God.
- What is it? What?
- Are you okay?
- Boo!
- Aah! Jesus!

601
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:25,396
We scared you!

602
00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:28,733
I got it!

603
00:38:28,775 --> 00:38:30,693
You think this is funny, huh?

604
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:33,571
We got you good.

605
00:38:33,613 --> 00:38:35,740
I stole the whole damn bowl.

606
00:38:37,325 --> 00:38:39,577
You don't know who
you're messing with, do you?

607
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:41,079
Take it easy, Big John.

608
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,164
- They're too young to know.
- Too young to know what?

609
00:38:43,206 --> 00:38:45,917
Do you have any idea
whose house this was?

610
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:47,835
No.

611
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:51,172
You ever hear of
Michael fucking Myers?

612
00:38:51,214 --> 00:38:53,883
And do you know
what happens to people

613
00:38:53,925 --> 00:38:58,012
who come into the Myers home
without an invitation?

614
00:38:58,054 --> 00:38:59,472
We're not even scared.

615
00:38:59,514 --> 00:39:02,767
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

616
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:05,645
He stabbed his sister
in the tits.

617
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:09,107
- Yuck.
- Right upstairs.

618
00:39:12,026 --> 00:39:16,531
And sometimes,
when the wind blows just right,

619
00:39:16,572 --> 00:39:19,534
we can still hear her ghost

620
00:39:19,575 --> 00:39:21,744
calling out his name.

621
00:39:21,786 --> 00:39:23,746
Oh, sh-she calls.

622
00:39:23,788 --> 00:39:25,373
Mm-hmm.

623
00:39:25,415 --> 00:39:28,793
Michael.

624
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:32,338
Michael...

625
00:39:33,923 --> 00:39:35,550
Get out of my yard,
you little perverts!

626
00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:40,847
Wh-What was that?

627
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:12,045
All right, let's go. Let's get
him into code room three.

628
00:40:12,086 --> 00:40:14,088
- What have we got here?
- Internal bleeding,

629
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,923
lacerations,
but he's gonna make it.

630
00:40:15,965 --> 00:40:17,508
Call Respiratory
for a ventilator.

631
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,093
- Officer Hawkins.
- Go. Go, go, go.

632
00:40:19,135 --> 00:40:20,678
Make sure trauma two is prepped.

633
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,972
And I need help
getting him on the table.

634
00:40:38,321 --> 00:40:41,157
Allyson. Allyson.

635
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:44,827
Hey. Can I speak with you?

636
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:47,121
Ask you a few questions?

637
00:40:52,168 --> 00:40:55,129
I was always told
that I couldn't...

638
00:40:57,048 --> 00:40:59,384
I couldn't talk about Michael.

639
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:02,887
I could never acknowledge
the tragedy.

640
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:05,098
It was as if
my mother's biggest fear

641
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:06,933
was that my grandmother
was right

642
00:41:06,975 --> 00:41:09,644
and the Boogeyman was real.

643
00:41:09,686 --> 00:41:11,479
For 40 years, he was waiting

644
00:41:11,521 --> 00:41:13,022
to come and kill my mother.

645
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:15,483
He found where she lived.

646
00:41:15,525 --> 00:41:17,860
He came to her house.

647
00:41:19,445 --> 00:41:21,531
She put us in his path.

648
00:41:23,908 --> 00:41:26,202
He murdered my husband.

649
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,955
That's what happened.

650
00:41:28,997 --> 00:41:30,957
Well, so how did Michael know?

651
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:34,335
How did he know how to find
your grandmother?

652
00:41:34,377 --> 00:41:35,920
He didn't.

653
00:41:35,962 --> 00:41:37,547
It was his doctor.

654
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:39,674
Michael's doctor.

655
00:41:39,716 --> 00:41:41,843
He is the one that...

656
00:41:41,884 --> 00:41:44,178
He took him there.
He knew where to go.

657
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,307
And he's the one
that brought them together.

658
00:41:49,142 --> 00:41:52,020
It was his obsession,

659
00:41:52,061 --> 00:41:53,771
not Michael's.

660
00:41:53,813 --> 00:41:55,440
But we got him.

661
00:41:55,481 --> 00:41:58,359
Shot him in the face,
burned him alive

662
00:41:58,401 --> 00:42:01,029
so he can't hurt anyone
ever again.

663
00:42:05,074 --> 00:42:06,868
I'm sorry, Karen.

664
00:42:06,909 --> 00:42:08,786
Thank you.

665
00:42:08,828 --> 00:42:10,705
No one told you?

666
00:42:10,747 --> 00:42:12,665
Told me what?

667
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:18,546
Michael Myers is alive.

668
00:42:18,588 --> 00:42:19,589
What?!

669
00:42:20,715 --> 00:42:22,383
Allyson, Allyson!
Allyson, are you okay?

670
00:42:22,425 --> 00:42:24,260
- Oh, sorry.
- Slow down.

671
00:42:24,302 --> 00:42:26,471
- Allyson, please wait.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

672
00:42:26,512 --> 00:42:29,390
I'm so sorry. I just want to
help in any way I can, okay?

673
00:42:29,432 --> 00:42:31,392
- He's still alive.
- We're going after him.

674
00:42:31,434 --> 00:42:33,269
Me, my dad, you,
if you want to come.

675
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:35,229
We're joining Tommy Doyle.

676
00:42:36,606 --> 00:42:39,359
You need to get
everybody here now.

677
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,653
If he is alive,
he is on his way here.

678
00:42:41,694 --> 00:42:43,404
Mom.

679
00:42:43,446 --> 00:42:46,199
Honey, I want you to go
and sit in Grandmother's room

680
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,242
and wait there
until she wakes up, okay?

681
00:42:48,284 --> 00:42:50,078
- No.
- No, no, no. She-she's coming with us.

682
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:51,537
- We're joining Tommy Doyle.
- She what?

683
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:53,498
I don't know if you've heard,
but they've...

684
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:55,249
No, the police officers should
be on their way here right now.

685
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:57,001
Tommy's organizing groups,
groups of people that care.

686
00:42:57,043 --> 00:42:58,670
We're gonna go after him.
We're gonna find Michael.

687
00:42:58,711 --> 00:43:01,214
I'm going with them.
We're gonna hunt him down,

688
00:43:01,255 --> 00:43:03,091
- and we're gonna put an end to this.
- Yeah.

689
00:43:03,132 --> 00:43:05,426
No, he is on his way here.
I keep telling them that.

690
00:43:05,468 --> 00:43:08,388
He is stalking her, and we are
staying here to protect her.

691
00:43:08,429 --> 00:43:11,057
He's infected your family,
he's infected my family

692
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:13,184
with grief and fear
for 40 years.

693
00:43:13,226 --> 00:43:14,811
He's gonna die tonight.

694
00:43:14,852 --> 00:43:16,688
- He killed Dad.
- Clear the hallway! You have to move!

695
00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:19,065
Excuse me! My husband,
he's been very badly hurt!

696
00:43:19,107 --> 00:43:20,858
Clear the hallway, people.

697
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,443
Go back to the waiting area.

698
00:43:22,485 --> 00:43:24,946
Go back to the waiting room.
Clear the hallway.

699
00:43:24,988 --> 00:43:27,615
I'm not gonna pretend
this didn't happen.

700
00:43:27,657 --> 00:43:29,409
I love Dad, and somebody loves

701
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,495
whoever is laying
under those sheets right now.

702
00:43:33,746 --> 00:43:36,249
Look. Look at me.
We failed, baby.

703
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,376
We set a trap,
we set the whole thing on fire,

704
00:43:38,418 --> 00:43:40,253
and he lived through it.
Think about that.

705
00:43:40,294 --> 00:43:42,380
The police are out there
looking for him.

706
00:43:42,422 --> 00:43:45,008
You think you're the one
that's gonna find him?

707
00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:48,469
Sit in that room
and wait with your grandmother.

708
00:43:48,511 --> 00:43:50,179
Now!

709
00:43:54,934 --> 00:43:56,894
Does the hospital have
security guards?

710
00:43:56,936 --> 00:43:58,438
Do you have security guards?

711
00:43:58,479 --> 00:44:00,189
It seems like you should have
security guards

712
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:02,191
in case something
like this happens.

713
00:44:02,233 --> 00:44:03,860
And this is happening right now.

714
00:44:03,901 --> 00:44:06,821
I mean, my daughter is in here,
my mother is in here,

715
00:44:06,863 --> 00:44:09,073
there is a madman
on the loose...

716
00:44:09,115 --> 00:44:11,034
Oh! Oh, God!

717
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:20,418
Goodbye, Michael.

718
00:44:52,992 --> 00:44:56,329
This is for you,
whenever you need it.

719
00:45:13,888 --> 00:45:16,224
She's here. She's here.
We found her. Laurie's here.

720
00:45:16,265 --> 00:45:18,726
She's in recovery.

721
00:45:18,768 --> 00:45:20,103
It's lucky she survived.

722
00:45:20,144 --> 00:45:21,854
I just heard from
one of the police officers

723
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:23,272
at her compound.

724
00:45:23,314 --> 00:45:25,400
11 dead bodies.
They're all first responders.

725
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:27,318
Holy shit.
Cameron's in there.

726
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,320
Three of his friends
were killed.

727
00:45:29,362 --> 00:45:31,072
- It's a madhouse.
- All right, Lonnie, listen.

728
00:45:31,114 --> 00:45:33,157
The only way
we're gonna stop this

729
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:35,118
is if we all come together
on this.

730
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:36,369
You're goddamn right.

731
00:45:36,411 --> 00:45:38,121
- All right. All right.
- All right?

732
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:42,458
How about this sassy tackle?

733
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:45,461
You have a permit for all these?

734
00:45:45,503 --> 00:45:46,546
Some of 'em.

735
00:45:46,587 --> 00:45:49,173
- Dad.
- Hey, hey.

736
00:45:50,466 --> 00:45:52,385
- Where's your girlfriend?
- Uh, she's okay.

737
00:45:52,427 --> 00:45:54,220
- She's gonna stay with her family.
- Good for her.

738
00:45:54,262 --> 00:45:55,805
- Hey, Mr. Doyle.
- Hey, buddy.

739
00:45:55,847 --> 00:45:58,182
Lonnie, check it out.

740
00:46:01,269 --> 00:46:03,313
You guys are coming, too?

741
00:46:03,354 --> 00:46:04,772
Couldn't let you have
all the fun.

742
00:46:04,814 --> 00:46:06,524
So many victims
in our neighborhood.

743
00:46:06,566 --> 00:46:08,026
Close friends of ours,
and we just want to help out.

744
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:09,277
I'm a doctor.
My husband's a nurse.

745
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:10,903
I should've guessed.

746
00:46:10,945 --> 00:46:12,739
All right, we have to give all
these people protection.

747
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,449
- You got to share your shit, Lonnie.
- All right.

748
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,367
You coming with us?

749
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:18,411
Let's see what you got.

750
00:46:18,453 --> 00:46:20,330
Yeah, just help yourself.

751
00:46:21,831 --> 00:46:25,293
Michael Myers has haunted
this town for 40 years.

752
00:46:27,003 --> 00:46:28,796
Tonight, we hunt him down.

753
00:46:34,677 --> 00:46:36,804
Excuse me.
I need some good people.

754
00:46:36,846 --> 00:46:38,848
People who aren't afraid
to get their hands dirty.

755
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,558
Everybody else needs to go home.

756
00:46:42,352 --> 00:46:44,354
So, what do we do
if we find him?

757
00:46:44,395 --> 00:46:46,064
Go inside. Go inside.

758
00:46:46,105 --> 00:46:47,815
It's not safe to be out. Go.

759
00:46:47,857 --> 00:46:49,359
It's not safe to be out.

760
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,028
Man, I had an altercation
with Myers about an hour ago,

761
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,571
but he escaped.

762
00:46:53,613 --> 00:46:55,323
Now, listen, boys,
there's strength in numbers.

763
00:46:55,365 --> 00:46:57,408
You cover Spring Creek
to the bypass,

764
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,452
and then let me know
if you see anything.

765
00:46:59,494 --> 00:47:02,580
This man is a threat,
and we need to stop him tonight!

766
00:47:04,165 --> 00:47:06,167
Nobody ever took him seriously.

767
00:47:06,209 --> 00:47:07,960
- Who?
- Dr. Loomis,

768
00:47:08,002 --> 00:47:10,004
Michael's first doctor.

769
00:47:10,046 --> 00:47:11,673
He knew a killer
when he saw one.

770
00:47:11,714 --> 00:47:13,591
Now, the only way to catch him

771
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:16,344
is to play by his own game...
the element of surprise.

772
00:47:16,386 --> 00:47:18,137
So he thinks
you're going one place,

773
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:20,390
then you pop up someplace else.

774
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:22,392
And keep your eyes open.

775
00:47:25,144 --> 00:47:26,354
Eyes open.

776
00:47:31,734 --> 00:47:34,028
Wait, what's going on
over there?

777
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,905
Baby, who is that?

778
00:47:35,947 --> 00:47:37,949
Looks like kids.

779
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:39,450
They all alone?

780
00:47:39,492 --> 00:47:41,577
Marion, give me the flashlight.

781
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:43,705
It's the wrong night to be out.

782
00:47:43,746 --> 00:47:44,872
Careful, Lindsey.

783
00:47:44,914 --> 00:47:46,624
- Lindsey, I wouldn't go...
- Stay here.

784
00:47:50,086 --> 00:47:51,713
Never fired a gun before.

785
00:47:51,754 --> 00:47:54,215
Right, so I don't even know
why they gave you a gun.

786
00:47:54,257 --> 00:47:56,092
It's big, too.
Can you handle it?

787
00:47:56,134 --> 00:47:57,385
That's a no.

788
00:47:57,427 --> 00:47:58,553
Give me, give me.
I shot this shit before.

789
00:47:58,594 --> 00:48:00,054
Okay. If you want it.

790
00:48:00,096 --> 00:48:01,139
I got it.

791
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,932
Okay. Fine.

792
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:06,769
Hey.

793
00:48:06,811 --> 00:48:08,730
What are you guys
doing out here?

794
00:48:08,771 --> 00:48:10,565
It's Halloween.
We've been trick-or-treating.

795
00:48:10,606 --> 00:48:12,150
- We got a whole bag of candy.
- You guys should not be

796
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:13,526
out here right now, okay?
It's not safe.

797
00:48:13,568 --> 00:48:14,736
- You gonna kill me?
- No.

798
00:48:14,777 --> 00:48:15,903
Satan, not today.

799
00:48:15,945 --> 00:48:18,072
- Oh, I'm so scared.
- Are you guys alone?

800
00:48:18,114 --> 00:48:19,615
- Where are your parents?
- No.

801
00:48:19,657 --> 00:48:21,326
No, we're waiting
for our friend.

802
00:48:21,367 --> 00:48:22,952
And, like, there's
a creepy man in a white mask,

803
00:48:22,994 --> 00:48:25,705
and he keeps, like, trying
to play hide-and-seek with us,

804
00:48:25,747 --> 00:48:27,915
- and he thinks...
- And I think he's a pervert.

805
00:48:27,957 --> 00:48:29,208
Where did you see him?

806
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,460
He's just hiding behind trees.

807
00:48:30,501 --> 00:48:31,586
And he pops out like,
"Peekaboo!"

808
00:48:31,627 --> 00:48:33,254
I mean, we're not
three years old.

809
00:48:33,296 --> 00:48:34,589
- Come on, man!
- Oh, look, there he is.

810
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:37,300
- Oh, hello!
- Hello.

811
00:48:37,342 --> 00:48:39,344
What the hell are you doing?

812
00:48:41,137 --> 00:48:43,306
You want some candy?

813
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:47,852
Is that Dennis's mask?

814
00:48:47,894 --> 00:48:49,562
Run. Go home now.

815
00:48:49,604 --> 00:48:51,606
Before he kills us all!
Get out of here!

816
00:48:51,648 --> 00:48:53,441
Run! Do not turn around!

817
00:48:53,483 --> 00:48:55,360
Keep going home!

818
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,695
Oh, my God.

819
00:48:57,737 --> 00:48:59,614
What if someone is disabled?

820
00:48:59,656 --> 00:49:01,449
- Like, that doesn't make any sense...
- Yeah, but...

821
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the hell is that?
- What the fuck?
- It's Michael.

822
00:49:09,666 --> 00:49:11,959
Fuck this bullshit! Drive!

823
00:49:12,001 --> 00:49:13,461
Go! Go!

824
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Drive the fucking...

825
00:49:25,807 --> 00:49:27,141
God!

826
00:49:29,018 --> 00:49:31,396
- No, whoa! Jesus, Marion.
- Marion, watch it!

827
00:49:35,858 --> 00:49:37,443
- Marion, the door's locked!
- I don't want to die in here!

828
00:49:37,485 --> 00:49:38,987
- Unlock the door!
- Unlock the door! - Oh!

829
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Come on! - Let me out of here!
- Move! He's behind you!
- The door's locked, Marion.
- Move!

830
00:49:47,704 --> 00:49:48,830
Go, go!

831
00:49:48,871 --> 00:49:49,664
Vanessa, go!

832
00:49:49,706 --> 00:49:51,582
Get out of the fucking car!

833
00:49:51,624 --> 00:49:54,377
I love you, baby!

834
00:49:54,419 --> 00:49:56,754
No!

835
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Let go of her!
- Okay, come on. We got to go. We got to go.
- Oh, God.

836
00:50:04,053 --> 00:50:06,514
No.

837
00:50:06,556 --> 00:50:08,057
Shoot him! Shoot him, Marion!

838
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:09,517
Hey, Michael.

839
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:11,853
This is for Dr. Loomis.

840
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,487
- Oh, God. No!
- Marion!

841
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come on. Die.
Die, die, die!

842
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

843
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

844
00:53:28,216 --> 00:53:30,718
Mom. Oh, God. No, wait.

845
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,388
Stop, stop, please.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

846
00:53:33,429 --> 00:53:34,931
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

847
00:53:34,973 --> 00:53:37,767
You had a knife
in your fucking stomach.

848
00:53:37,809 --> 00:53:40,103
It's a paper cut.

849
00:53:40,144 --> 00:53:42,063
Where's Allyson?

850
00:53:43,189 --> 00:53:45,650
She was supposed
to be in here, with you.

851
00:53:45,692 --> 00:53:47,568
- You didn't see her?
- Nah...

852
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,113
I'm so geeked out
on pain meds, kiddo.

853
00:53:50,154 --> 00:53:52,615
Uh, uh, no.

854
00:53:55,535 --> 00:53:57,120
Is everything okay?

855
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,999
She probably just needed
some fresh air.

856
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:07,130
My God, they just leave your
bloody shirt just sitting here?

857
00:54:09,465 --> 00:54:11,342
Karen.

858
00:54:12,385 --> 00:54:14,637
Karen.

859
00:54:15,638 --> 00:54:17,807
Michael's gone.

860
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:20,310
We got him.

861
00:54:20,351 --> 00:54:22,103
That's right. We got him.

862
00:54:22,145 --> 00:54:25,898
We burned him
to the goddamn ground.

863
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,234
Excuse us.

864
00:54:28,276 --> 00:54:30,486
Pardon.

865
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:32,071
- Uh, over here.
- Frank?

866
00:54:32,113 --> 00:54:34,282
- Go a little further back.
- Okay. Okay.

867
00:54:34,324 --> 00:54:35,616
- Got the draw sheet?
- Yeah.

868
00:54:35,658 --> 00:54:36,951
One, two...

869
00:54:36,993 --> 00:54:38,536
There you go.

870
00:54:38,578 --> 00:54:39,996
Okay.

871
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:43,333
You knew my dad?

872
00:54:43,374 --> 00:54:45,668
Yeah, I knew Ray.

873
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:48,629
He used to sell me peyote.

874
00:54:48,671 --> 00:54:52,842
I remember once we were out
on Lake Cherokee in this canoe

875
00:54:52,884 --> 00:54:55,303
with a shaman from Little Rock.

876
00:54:55,345 --> 00:54:59,223
Your-your daddy got freaked out

877
00:54:59,265 --> 00:55:01,059
by his own reflection.

878
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,603
He took off his pants,
and he jumped in.

879
00:55:05,396 --> 00:55:07,815
I stopped doing drugs with him,

880
00:55:07,857 --> 00:55:10,693
but I'll-I'll miss him.

881
00:55:10,735 --> 00:55:12,528
- Dad.
- What? It's true.

882
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,614
No, no, no.
Dad, look, right there.

883
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:16,908
You see that? That's Tommy.

884
00:55:16,949 --> 00:55:19,369
- Yeah.
- Whose car is that?

885
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:21,704
Lindsey's. Shit.

886
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:26,834
Lindsey's car.

887
00:55:26,876 --> 00:55:28,753
It's covered in blood.
There's no bodies.

888
00:55:28,795 --> 00:55:30,713
It's Michael.

889
00:55:30,755 --> 00:55:32,548
He's here.

890
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,884
Come on, I need you guys.
Come on.

891
00:55:34,926 --> 00:55:36,094
Be careful now, all right?

892
00:55:36,135 --> 00:55:37,512
Keep your heads up, eyes open.

893
00:55:37,553 --> 00:55:39,180
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

894
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:41,683
Lindsey!

895
00:55:41,724 --> 00:55:43,893
- Okay.
- Just be safe, okay?

896
00:55:43,935 --> 00:55:45,728
You, too. Lindsey!

897
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,855
Lindsey!

898
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:51,693
Lindsey!

899
00:55:51,734 --> 00:55:53,736
- Marion!
- Marion!

900
00:55:57,657 --> 00:55:59,492
You guys be careful, okay?

901
00:55:59,534 --> 00:56:01,202
Keep your heads up.

902
00:56:02,704 --> 00:56:04,914
Oh, shit, Tommy.

903
00:56:08,584 --> 00:56:10,753
Oh, fuck.

904
00:56:15,758 --> 00:56:17,468
Oh, God.

905
00:56:33,443 --> 00:56:34,986
Fuck me.

906
00:56:35,028 --> 00:56:36,904
Yo, Dad, Dad.
What's over there?

907
00:56:36,946 --> 00:56:39,157
We found something.

908
00:56:40,283 --> 00:56:42,076
Oh, God.

909
00:56:44,787 --> 00:56:47,415
Oh, I'm sorry.

910
00:56:47,457 --> 00:56:49,917
- That's Marion, Lonnie.
- He did this.

911
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:52,920
Oh, God, Marion.

912
00:56:52,962 --> 00:56:55,548
Tommy, what the fuck?

913
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:58,301
I'm gonna get you.

914
00:56:58,343 --> 00:57:00,803
Come and get it, man.

915
00:57:07,435 --> 00:57:08,811
Over here.

916
00:57:08,853 --> 00:57:11,064
She's over here.

917
00:57:11,105 --> 00:57:13,650
I saw his face.

918
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:14,859
I saw everything.

919
00:57:14,901 --> 00:57:16,110
He's still out there.

920
00:57:16,152 --> 00:57:17,695
- She's lucky to be alive.
- I saw him.

921
00:57:17,737 --> 00:57:18,946
You saw his face?

922
00:57:18,988 --> 00:57:21,115
He's still out there, Tommy.

923
00:57:21,157 --> 00:57:23,117
You'll be okay, Lindsey.

924
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:24,661
You're gonna be okay.

925
00:57:24,702 --> 00:57:27,288
He's still out there.

926
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:32,335
Frank.

927
00:57:34,629 --> 00:57:36,589
Frank, are you awake?

928
00:57:44,013 --> 00:57:46,849
Do you remember that night?

929
00:57:46,891 --> 00:57:49,185
At the bar?

930
00:57:50,395 --> 00:57:52,689
You know, I-I never
said anything,

931
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,066
'cause I couldn't be sure.

932
00:57:57,902 --> 00:58:00,238
I was so messed up.

933
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:09,330
But you helped me.

934
00:58:13,376 --> 00:58:15,211
I always liked you.

935
00:58:18,297 --> 00:58:21,175
You so crazy.

936
00:58:21,217 --> 00:58:23,177
Fuck you.

937
00:58:26,347 --> 00:58:27,890
Hi.

938
00:58:28,725 --> 00:58:30,893
Hi.

939
00:58:32,687 --> 00:58:34,605
I remember that night.

940
00:58:34,647 --> 00:58:36,441
Yeah.

941
00:58:38,067 --> 00:58:39,861
I kissed you.

942
00:58:39,902 --> 00:58:41,863
Yeah.

943
00:58:41,904 --> 00:58:43,740
I remember.

944
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:46,034
You held my hand.

945
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,203
That was it.

946
00:58:49,245 --> 00:58:52,123
Now, I was hoping for more.

947
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:56,753
But I knew you were sweet for...

948
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,132
Ben Tramer.

949
00:59:06,304 --> 00:59:07,680
Frank.

950
00:59:10,683 --> 00:59:12,518
We got him.

951
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:16,105
We killed Michael.

952
00:59:16,898 --> 00:59:18,691
You ki...

953
00:59:21,486 --> 00:59:23,446
Well, it's about time.

954
00:59:23,488 --> 00:59:25,239
Ow.

955
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:27,867
Ow. Don't make me laugh.

956
00:59:27,909 --> 00:59:30,328
Oh, good. You're awake.

957
00:59:32,163 --> 00:59:33,998
Now, on a scale from one to ten,

958
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,793
what is your pain level,
with ten being the worst?

959
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:38,294
Number 11.

960
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,838
This will make the pain go away.

961
00:59:43,299 --> 00:59:44,592
Laurie.

962
00:59:44,634 --> 00:59:47,387
Nurse, will you do me a favor?

963
00:59:48,179 --> 00:59:49,931
Help out my friend here.

964
00:59:49,973 --> 00:59:52,517
Make it a double.

965
00:59:52,558 --> 00:59:55,019
You stood up to that monster.

966
00:59:55,061 --> 00:59:57,063
I tried, Tommy.

967
00:59:57,105 --> 00:59:59,107
You know, when we were kids,

968
00:59:59,148 --> 01:00:01,109
we used to all dare each other

969
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:03,111
to sneak into
the old Myers house.

970
01:00:04,654 --> 01:00:07,949
Lonnie was the only one
brave enough to do it.

971
01:00:07,991 --> 01:00:09,742
I lied.

972
01:00:10,827 --> 01:00:13,621
I never made it inside.

973
01:00:13,663 --> 01:00:15,707
When they arrested
Michael that night,

974
01:00:15,748 --> 01:00:18,376
I was telling my wife
that my daughter was killed,

975
01:00:18,418 --> 01:00:21,379
so I wasn't there to put
a bullet in his brain,

976
01:00:21,421 --> 01:00:23,464
like we should have.
This is no time for prudence.

977
01:00:23,506 --> 01:00:25,800
How'm I supposed to know
if my brother's alive or not?

978
01:00:25,842 --> 01:00:28,052
- I-I don't know.
- I've been waiting here for over an hour.

979
01:00:28,094 --> 01:00:30,013
Who the hell's in charge here?

980
01:00:30,054 --> 01:00:31,556
Authorized medical
and security personnel only.

981
01:00:31,597 --> 01:00:33,308
There's not enough medical
or security help.

982
01:00:33,349 --> 01:00:34,809
- He's going to kill everybody!
- You need to relax.

983
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:36,394
We've requested backup officers
and medical staff

984
01:00:36,436 --> 01:00:37,895
from Russellville
and Eaton County for support,

985
01:00:37,937 --> 01:00:39,230
but no confirmation.

986
01:00:39,272 --> 01:00:41,149
We can't handle
this scope a crime scene.

987
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:43,192
My son.
My son Oscar, is he here?

988
01:00:43,234 --> 01:00:44,360
Uh, I got a call.

989
01:00:44,402 --> 01:00:46,070
I'm his mother. Is he alive?

990
01:00:46,112 --> 01:00:47,447
I have no idea, but triage
expansion just opened up.

991
01:00:47,488 --> 01:00:48,948
I'm gonna have you sign in
right here.

992
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:50,325
It's spelled B-E-R-L-U-C-C-H-I.

993
01:00:50,366 --> 01:00:51,743
Clear the hallway, please.

994
01:00:51,784 --> 01:00:52,785
Somebody help!

995
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:54,162
Please, emergency.

996
01:00:54,203 --> 01:00:55,330
Take her to
the emergency room, please.

997
01:00:55,371 --> 01:00:56,914
You're gonna be okay, Linds.

998
01:00:56,956 --> 01:00:58,207
He's still out there, Tommy.

999
01:00:58,249 --> 01:00:59,959
- Be careful.
- Karen.

1000
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:01,711
How are you doing?
How's your mom?

1001
01:01:01,753 --> 01:01:03,254
- How's Laurie? Is she okay?
- Where's my daughter?

1002
01:01:03,296 --> 01:01:04,672
She's okay. She's fine.

1003
01:01:04,714 --> 01:01:05,757
She's with Lonnie and Cameron.

1004
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:06,966
No, no, but he's coming here.

1005
01:01:07,008 --> 01:01:08,259
She's not supposed
to be with them.

1006
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:10,219
He's coming here?
How do you know that?

1007
01:01:10,261 --> 01:01:13,097
All right, secure a perimeter.
Hospital's on lockdown.

1008
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:15,683
All right, listen, folks. Listen!

1009
01:01:15,725 --> 01:01:17,185
Folks, please.

1010
01:01:17,226 --> 01:01:18,853
The Boogeyman is at large.

1011
01:01:18,895 --> 01:01:21,689
He's got no choice
but to emerge.

1012
01:01:21,731 --> 01:01:23,524
He is an apex predator.

1013
01:01:23,566 --> 01:01:25,860
When he surfaces,
there will be no pause.

1014
01:01:25,902 --> 01:01:27,362
There will be no empathy.

1015
01:01:27,403 --> 01:01:30,031
This ends when Michael is dead!

1016
01:01:30,073 --> 01:01:32,241
Michael Myers will be
executed tonight,

1017
01:01:32,283 --> 01:01:35,286
and it will not go
without witness!

1018
01:01:35,328 --> 01:01:38,623
We need all of you.

1019
01:01:38,665 --> 01:01:41,084
Evil dies tonight!

1020
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:42,126
Evil dies tonight!

1021
01:01:42,168 --> 01:01:44,045
All right, everybody, calm down.

1022
01:01:44,087 --> 01:01:45,171
The Sheriff's Department
has this...

1023
01:01:45,213 --> 01:01:46,297
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1024
01:01:46,339 --> 01:01:47,632
Sheriff, we will not calm down.

1025
01:01:47,674 --> 01:01:49,300
We have watched
your department fail...

1026
01:01:49,342 --> 01:01:50,969
- fail tonight!
- Tommy's right!

1027
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:52,261
This is Haddonfield.

1028
01:01:52,303 --> 01:01:54,222
This is our town.

1029
01:01:54,263 --> 01:01:57,141
He killed my daughter
40 years ago

1030
01:01:57,183 --> 01:01:59,143
and desecrated her body.

1031
01:01:59,185 --> 01:02:00,395
Evil dies tonight.

1032
01:02:00,436 --> 01:02:01,896
Goddamn it, Brackett!

1033
01:02:01,938 --> 01:02:04,065
I am the law, not you.

1034
01:02:04,107 --> 01:02:06,234
- Fuck off, Barker.
- Jonesy, get over there!

1035
01:02:06,275 --> 01:02:07,485
Robin, I need you up there.

1036
01:02:07,527 --> 01:02:09,153
I need you over here.
You two...

1037
01:02:09,195 --> 01:02:10,530
Laurie!

1038
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:12,115
- Tommy, you can't go in there!
- Tommy?

1039
01:02:12,156 --> 01:02:13,825
- Tommy, you can't go in there!
- Laurie. Laurie.

1040
01:02:13,866 --> 01:02:15,410
- Tommy!
- Tommy.

1041
01:02:15,451 --> 01:02:17,370
- Laurie. He killed Marion.
- Tommy.

1042
01:02:17,412 --> 01:02:19,998
- And he attacked Lindsey, too.
- What? Karen.

1043
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:22,166
We didn't know for sure.
I didn't know what to tell you.

1044
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:24,627
Mom, I just want you to be okay.

1045
01:02:24,669 --> 01:02:26,629
Listen, I just want you to know,
when he gets here,

1046
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:29,590
I'm gonna fucking kill him,
because 40 years ago,

1047
01:02:29,632 --> 01:02:32,093
- when I was a kid, you protected me.
- Yeah.

1048
01:02:32,135 --> 01:02:34,554
So, tonight,
I'm gonna protect you. Okay?

1049
01:02:34,595 --> 01:02:36,931
Nurse.
You know, I appreciate you,

1050
01:02:36,973 --> 01:02:38,975
but could you get out, please?

1051
01:02:39,017 --> 01:02:40,893
Like, get out now!

1052
01:02:42,061 --> 01:02:43,271
We had him.

1053
01:02:43,313 --> 01:02:44,772
How did he escape?

1054
01:02:44,814 --> 01:02:46,274
I don't know. I don't know.

1055
01:02:46,316 --> 01:02:47,942
What do we do? We don't
have the police support.

1056
01:02:47,984 --> 01:02:49,610
We fight.

1057
01:02:49,652 --> 01:02:50,862
We always fight.

1058
01:02:50,903 --> 01:02:53,531
- Go! Find him, Tommy!
- Yeah. I will. I will.

1059
01:02:53,573 --> 01:02:55,491
- I... No.
- Mom, don't. Don't.

1060
01:02:55,533 --> 01:02:57,035
I need you to listen to me.

1061
01:02:57,076 --> 01:02:58,745
You need to listen to me
right now, okay?

1062
01:02:58,786 --> 01:03:02,165
All right, a lifetime
of preparation, and for what?

1063
01:03:02,206 --> 01:03:04,042
Ray is dead.

1064
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:05,626
So many people are dead.

1065
01:03:05,668 --> 01:03:07,128
We're not equipped.

1066
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,964
Allyson's run off
with crazy Lonnie Elam.

1067
01:03:10,006 --> 01:03:12,133
People are losing their minds.

1068
01:03:12,175 --> 01:03:14,719
There are authorities
who are trained

1069
01:03:14,761 --> 01:03:17,722
to deal with exactly
this kind of... this...

1070
01:03:17,764 --> 01:03:20,266
There's a system.

1071
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,478
Well, the system failed.

1072
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:25,396
Now, get the fuck out of my way.

1073
01:03:25,438 --> 01:03:27,315
- Don't. No. No.
- No, no, no. Get away.

1074
01:03:27,357 --> 01:03:28,483
- What are you doing?
- Karen, no!

1075
01:03:28,524 --> 01:03:29,525
- Stop right now!
- Get away!

1076
01:03:29,567 --> 01:03:31,110
I am not gonna let you do this.

1077
01:03:31,152 --> 01:03:32,487
- No. Mom.
- Get out of my way.

1078
01:03:32,528 --> 01:03:34,364
- Move!
- Mom, please, what are you doing?

1079
01:03:36,574 --> 01:03:38,993
Do you even know what that is?

1080
01:03:40,995 --> 01:03:42,872
It makes the pain go away.

1081
01:03:49,253 --> 01:03:50,838
Let him come for me.

1082
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,048
No.

1083
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:54,342
Let him take my head
as I take his.

1084
01:03:54,384 --> 01:03:57,095
- No.
- Maybe the only way he can die

1085
01:03:57,136 --> 01:03:58,262
is if I die, too.

1086
01:03:58,304 --> 01:04:01,015
- No.
- Karen, you and Allyson

1087
01:04:01,057 --> 01:04:02,725
should not have to keep running

1088
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:06,437
because of the darkness
that I created, honey.

1089
01:04:06,479 --> 01:04:09,023
So you just have to let me go.

1090
01:04:09,065 --> 01:04:11,109
- Karen, move!
- Mom, stop. Stop, Mom.

1091
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:13,486
Listen. Mom.

1092
01:04:15,863 --> 01:04:18,533
Stop.

1093
01:04:18,574 --> 01:04:21,786
I am not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1094
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,124
We want to get married.

1095
01:04:26,165 --> 01:04:28,292
Um...

1096
01:04:28,334 --> 01:04:31,421
Uh, I-I guess, uh, right away.

1097
01:04:31,462 --> 01:04:33,214
Right away, yeah. Right away.

1098
01:04:33,256 --> 01:04:36,384
The waggle dance
is how bees communicate.

1099
01:04:36,426 --> 01:04:38,386
They share the information
where the flower is

1100
01:04:38,428 --> 01:04:40,221
with the rest of the colony.

1101
01:04:40,263 --> 01:04:44,267
They communicate
the precise location

1102
01:04:44,309 --> 01:04:45,727
by shaking their butts.

1103
01:04:45,768 --> 01:04:47,812
What is in that honey?

1104
01:04:47,854 --> 01:04:50,189
Hey, Mom,
he wants to talk to you.

1105
01:04:50,231 --> 01:04:53,318
Hello, Mom.
Seymour Moskowitz.

1106
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,194
Right. Jewish.

1107
01:04:55,236 --> 01:04:58,740
My mom kept bees
before she died.

1108
01:05:01,034 --> 01:05:03,036
I'm sorry.

1109
01:05:03,077 --> 01:05:04,746
I'm sorry, baby.

1110
01:05:09,292 --> 01:05:11,919
And now they're
at the back door.

1111
01:05:11,961 --> 01:05:15,089
Halloween's over, kids!

1112
01:05:20,803 --> 01:05:22,847
I'll handle it.

1113
01:05:32,857 --> 01:05:34,275
Knock it off!

1114
01:05:39,697 --> 01:05:42,450
Well, now they're
at the front door.

1115
01:05:49,457 --> 01:05:51,959
Let's scare the shit
out of these kids.

1116
01:06:03,638 --> 01:06:05,682
John.

1117
01:06:06,766 --> 01:06:09,310
Don't you know
whose house this was?

1118
01:06:09,352 --> 01:06:10,979
Huh?

1119
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,064
Honey, don't do anything stupid.

1120
01:06:13,106 --> 01:06:14,899
We don't want to get sued.

1121
01:06:16,651 --> 01:06:19,028
I bet those bitches
are in the bushes.

1122
01:06:20,488 --> 01:06:23,032
Did you lock the back door?

1123
01:06:23,074 --> 01:06:24,742
Uh...

1124
01:06:24,784 --> 01:06:26,035
I'll check.

1125
01:06:28,037 --> 01:06:30,748
Next time, I'm coming
with a pitchfork.

1126
01:06:46,055 --> 01:06:47,640
Big John?

1127
01:06:48,391 --> 01:06:50,018
Big John?

1128
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:56,065
Yes, Little John?

1129
01:06:57,692 --> 01:07:00,320
Someone's in our house.

1130
01:07:00,361 --> 01:07:03,072
And it's not a child.

1131
01:07:08,745 --> 01:07:11,080
Fuck that.

1132
01:07:24,177 --> 01:07:26,596
I got this knife.

1133
01:07:31,434 --> 01:07:33,728
I got this knife.

1134
01:07:45,531 --> 01:07:47,325
Fuck off, man.

1135
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:49,494
Get out of my face.

1136
01:07:49,535 --> 01:07:51,287
Lonnie, where are you?

1137
01:07:51,329 --> 01:07:53,081
I'm at the hospital right now.

1138
01:07:53,122 --> 01:07:54,874
Yeah, I brought her in to E.R.

1139
01:07:56,459 --> 01:07:58,628
Is that him?

1140
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:01,923
I saw that guy on TV.

1141
01:08:01,964 --> 01:08:04,008
Back, back, back.

1142
01:08:11,641 --> 01:08:13,309
You know what I mean?

1143
01:08:15,061 --> 01:08:16,771
I have no answer for you.

1144
01:08:17,772 --> 01:08:19,816
Help me.

1145
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:22,527
Help me!

1146
01:08:27,573 --> 01:08:28,825
Tommy, what's happening?

1147
01:08:28,866 --> 01:08:30,410
- I don't know.
- Who is it?

1148
01:08:30,451 --> 01:08:31,786
Um...

1149
01:08:31,828 --> 01:08:34,080
- Help me!
- Who is it? Is it Michael?

1150
01:08:34,122 --> 01:08:36,040
- Is it him? - I don't know.
- It's Michael.

1151
01:08:36,082 --> 01:08:37,291
Michael's here.

1152
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:38,459
He's not wearing his mask!

1153
01:08:38,501 --> 01:08:40,545
- It's Michael.
- Michael!

1154
01:08:40,586 --> 01:08:43,131
Michael! Stop!

1155
01:08:45,216 --> 01:08:46,467
Stop!

1156
01:08:46,509 --> 01:08:47,677
Mom, Mom, you're not
going near him.

1157
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:49,220
- I'm gonna go.
- No, you're not.

1158
01:08:49,262 --> 01:08:50,513
Block the doorway!

1159
01:08:50,555 --> 01:08:52,682
Don't let him leave!

1160
01:08:52,724 --> 01:08:55,018
- He's getting away.
- Tommy, get him!

1161
01:08:55,059 --> 01:08:56,644
Excuse me.

1162
01:08:56,686 --> 01:08:59,647
Evil dies tonight!

1163
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:01,024
- Evil dies tonight!
- Come on!

1164
01:09:01,065 --> 01:09:05,153
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1165
01:09:05,194 --> 01:09:07,780
Evil dies tonight!

1166
01:09:07,822 --> 01:09:10,700
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1167
01:09:10,742 --> 01:09:12,785
Evil dies tonight!

1168
01:09:12,827 --> 01:09:17,123
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1169
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:21,836
Little John?

1170
01:09:22,587 --> 01:09:24,130
Big John.

1171
01:09:24,172 --> 01:09:25,673
Yeah.

1172
01:09:38,353 --> 01:09:40,355
Little John?

1173
01:09:40,396 --> 01:09:42,106
Big John.

1174
01:09:56,579 --> 01:09:59,916
Little John, the study's clear.

1175
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1176
01:10:55,179 --> 01:10:57,140
Big John!

1177
01:11:14,324 --> 01:11:16,326
Big John.

1178
01:11:16,367 --> 01:11:17,618
No.

1179
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:20,079
Big John.

1180
01:11:26,127 --> 01:11:27,837
Michael.

1181
01:11:32,258 --> 01:11:34,802
You've come home.

1182
01:11:42,602 --> 01:11:44,562
No!

1183
01:11:55,073 --> 01:11:57,241
No, no, no, that's not...

1184
01:11:57,283 --> 01:11:59,952
- That's not him. It's not him!
- It's not him? It's not him!

1185
01:11:59,994 --> 01:12:01,663
- That's not Michael!
- It's not him!

1186
01:12:01,704 --> 01:12:03,831
- It's not him! It's not him!
- Get him!

1187
01:12:03,873 --> 01:12:04,874
It's not him!

1188
01:12:04,916 --> 01:12:07,335
You fucking sheep, it's not him!

1189
01:12:07,377 --> 01:12:10,088
- It's not him! It's not him!
- Get out of the way!

1190
01:12:14,676 --> 01:12:16,678
Mom, Mom, Mom!

1191
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:17,720
Mom. Mom.

1192
01:12:17,762 --> 01:12:19,639
Mom. Mom!

1193
01:12:19,681 --> 01:12:21,182
I got to get you out of here.

1194
01:12:21,224 --> 01:12:22,350
Tommy!

1195
01:12:22,392 --> 01:12:24,727
Get back here!

1196
01:12:24,769 --> 01:12:27,689
Help! Help!

1197
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:30,358
Somebody help me!

1198
01:12:33,069 --> 01:12:34,737
Mom! Okay.

1199
01:12:34,779 --> 01:12:37,031
Okay. Okay, be careful.

1200
01:12:38,491 --> 01:12:40,451
- I got it, Sheriff.
- You're gonna be okay.

1201
01:12:40,493 --> 01:12:41,869
- Come on.
- Get him!

1202
01:12:41,911 --> 01:12:43,246
- It's not him.
- I know, Mom.

1203
01:12:43,287 --> 01:12:45,415
I got her. I got her.
Go, go, go.

1204
01:12:45,456 --> 01:12:47,083
- It's... not him.
- Your arm.

1205
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:48,835
- All right, let's get her...
- They're after the wrong guy.

1206
01:12:48,876 --> 01:12:50,837
- Let's get her into bed.
- It's not him. It's not Michael.

1207
01:13:03,057 --> 01:13:05,226
Get out of the way!

1208
01:13:05,268 --> 01:13:07,395
Okay, Mom. Come on.

1209
01:13:07,437 --> 01:13:08,896
We got you.

1210
01:13:08,938 --> 01:13:10,315
All right, gentle. Careful.

1211
01:13:10,356 --> 01:13:12,400
Careful. I can handle this.

1212
01:13:12,442 --> 01:13:14,485
Be careful of your head.

1213
01:13:14,527 --> 01:13:16,571
Okay. All right.

1214
01:13:16,612 --> 01:13:17,655
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1215
01:13:17,697 --> 01:13:19,198
All right, look, stay here.

1216
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,034
There's gonna be guards
outside the door, all right?

1217
01:13:21,075 --> 01:13:22,744
- Be careful.
- I'm gonna get a nurse to get you

1218
01:13:22,785 --> 01:13:24,120
- all hooked up again, okay?
- You be careful.

1219
01:13:24,162 --> 01:13:26,080
Hospital staff sightings
on the second floor.

1220
01:13:29,167 --> 01:13:31,419
Please stop!

1221
01:13:31,461 --> 01:13:33,963
Please! It's not Michael!

1222
01:13:34,005 --> 01:13:35,423
You don't know
what he looks like!

1223
01:13:35,465 --> 01:13:37,467
We're in the stairwell. Move!

1224
01:13:37,508 --> 01:13:40,053
Watch it, asshole. Karen.

1225
01:13:40,094 --> 01:13:42,972
You okay?
Here, move over to the side.

1226
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:45,433
To the side with them.
Careful, careful.

1227
01:13:45,475 --> 01:13:47,101
- He's up there!
- Stop! It's not him!

1228
01:13:47,143 --> 01:13:49,312
- Get out of my way!
- Tommy, stop! Chill out.

1229
01:13:49,354 --> 01:13:51,314
Get a grip, Tommy!

1230
01:13:51,356 --> 01:13:53,566
Get the fuck out of the way!

1231
01:13:53,608 --> 01:13:56,653
Knock it off!

1232
01:13:59,155 --> 01:14:01,199
Tommy!

1233
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,950
We're gonna kill him!

1234
01:14:02,992 --> 01:14:04,452
Evil dies tonight!

1235
01:14:04,494 --> 01:14:07,455
It's all happening.

1236
01:14:07,497 --> 01:14:10,166
Michael's masterpiece.

1237
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:13,211
He created this chaos, but...

1238
01:14:13,252 --> 01:14:16,839
I'm the one that brought it all
onto Haddonfield.

1239
01:14:16,881 --> 01:14:20,218
I could have made
all this go away.

1240
01:14:21,302 --> 01:14:24,931
It was that night
that you were attacked.

1241
01:14:24,973 --> 01:14:27,433
It's not your fault.

1242
01:14:27,475 --> 01:14:29,852
It's mine.

1243
01:14:34,148 --> 01:14:36,275
It was an accident.

1244
01:14:37,151 --> 01:14:40,405
I was lost in my own regret.

1245
01:14:40,446 --> 01:14:41,948
Did Michael kill again?

1246
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:44,742
I saw the look

1247
01:14:44,784 --> 01:14:47,078
in Loomis's eyes.

1248
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:50,498
All he wanted was more blood.

1249
01:14:51,749 --> 01:14:53,751
More death.

1250
01:14:53,793 --> 01:14:55,336
And I couldn't take it.

1251
01:14:55,378 --> 01:14:57,505
And then in that moment,
all I could think was that

1252
01:14:57,547 --> 01:15:00,967
inside that monster,
there was somebody's baby boy.

1253
01:15:02,385 --> 01:15:05,888
Purely and simply evil.

1254
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:08,850
No! Don't!

1255
01:15:08,891 --> 01:15:12,103
I could have made
all this go away.

1256
01:15:12,145 --> 01:15:15,481
It's not your fault.

1257
01:15:15,523 --> 01:15:17,734
It's mine.

1258
01:15:17,775 --> 01:15:20,069
But now I know...

1259
01:15:21,321 --> 01:15:25,950
...there's nothing
inside that man but pure evil.

1260
01:15:25,992 --> 01:15:28,077
It's not just Michael.

1261
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:31,289
It's what he's done
to this town, these people.

1262
01:15:32,415 --> 01:15:34,709
Decent people.

1263
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:36,544
You're a good man, Frank.

1264
01:15:36,586 --> 01:15:38,129
You were doing your job.

1265
01:15:38,171 --> 01:15:41,049
But now it needs to die.

1266
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:44,927
'Cause every time
somebody's afraid,

1267
01:15:44,969 --> 01:15:47,388
the Boogeyman wins.

1268
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:50,892
It needs to die.

1269
01:15:50,933 --> 01:15:55,146
And I'm the one
that needs to kill it.

1270
01:16:23,049 --> 01:16:24,717
It's not you.

1271
01:16:24,759 --> 01:16:26,636
I know it's not you.

1272
01:16:28,763 --> 01:16:30,974
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1273
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:42,652
I know you're scared.

1274
01:16:43,778 --> 01:16:45,655
They're scared, too.

1275
01:16:48,658 --> 01:16:51,285
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.

1276
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:11,306
Okay.

1277
01:17:11,347 --> 01:17:14,142
Okay. I know. I know.

1278
01:17:14,183 --> 01:17:16,894
I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna help you.

1279
01:17:16,936 --> 01:17:18,604
Okay, come on. Come on.

1280
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,025
Let go of my hand.

1281
01:17:22,066 --> 01:17:23,318
That's good.

1282
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:25,028
I'm gonna lock these doors.

1283
01:17:27,864 --> 01:17:28,990
Okay.

1284
01:17:29,032 --> 01:17:30,700
Okay. Lock this behind me.

1285
01:17:31,826 --> 01:17:33,369
They're coming.

1286
01:17:34,037 --> 01:17:35,496
They're coming.

1287
01:17:35,538 --> 01:17:37,790
Come on!

1288
01:17:46,174 --> 01:17:48,259
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.

1289
01:17:51,638 --> 01:17:52,764
It's him.

1290
01:17:52,805 --> 01:17:55,058
Get him! Get him!

1291
01:18:23,795 --> 01:18:25,713
Evil dies tonight!

1292
01:18:25,755 --> 01:18:26,964
Evil dies tonight!

1293
01:18:27,006 --> 01:18:30,093
Evil dies tonight!

1294
01:18:40,728 --> 01:18:42,647
Evil dies tonight!

1295
01:18:45,483 --> 01:18:50,154
Evil dies tonight!
Evil dies tonight!

1296
01:18:52,448 --> 01:18:54,075
Stop them!

1297
01:18:54,117 --> 01:18:55,868
It's not him?

1298
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,828
- Move!
- Evil dies tonight!

1299
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:40,621
Evil dies tonight!

1300
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:44,667
- Oh, my God.
- He's dead.

1301
01:19:46,836 --> 01:19:48,629
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

1302
01:19:48,671 --> 01:19:50,631
Evil dies tonight!

1303
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:01,809
Leigh! Leigh!

1304
01:20:01,851 --> 01:20:04,062
No. It's not him.

1305
01:20:04,103 --> 01:20:06,314
It's not him, Tommy.

1306
01:20:07,315 --> 01:20:09,817
He's always worn a mask.
How do we know it's not him?

1307
01:20:09,859 --> 01:20:11,319
How do we know, Leigh?

1308
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:22,538
Now he's turning us
into monsters.

1309
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,610
I swear I was just trying
to do the right thing.

1310
01:20:53,611 --> 01:20:54,988
Look at me.

1311
01:20:58,908 --> 01:21:01,869
What I'm thinking is
the killer was choking him,

1312
01:21:01,911 --> 01:21:04,038
Pete went for his gun.

1313
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:07,000
As he pulled it up, it went off.

1314
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:11,337
Give me your gun.

1315
01:21:12,171 --> 01:21:13,506
Don't look at it.

1316
01:21:13,548 --> 01:21:16,301
Just be cool
and give me your gun.

1317
01:21:16,342 --> 01:21:18,386
Take this.

1318
01:21:18,428 --> 01:21:20,221
It was an accident.

1319
01:21:20,263 --> 01:21:21,889
He shot himself.

1320
01:21:21,931 --> 01:21:23,599
Got it?

1321
01:21:24,434 --> 01:21:25,727
Just because
your intentions are good

1322
01:21:25,768 --> 01:21:27,937
doesn't mean things
always work out.

1323
01:21:30,815 --> 01:21:32,400
I stood in the way.

1324
01:21:32,442 --> 01:21:34,402
It was me.

1325
01:21:34,444 --> 01:21:36,904
- It wasn't him.
- Let me find him, then.

1326
01:21:36,946 --> 01:21:38,406
He's after me.

1327
01:21:38,448 --> 01:21:40,199
No, he's not.

1328
01:21:40,241 --> 01:21:41,743
Frank.

1329
01:21:41,784 --> 01:21:44,537
He's not.

1330
01:21:44,579 --> 01:21:46,914
It was the doctor that took him
to your house tonight.

1331
01:21:46,956 --> 01:21:48,291
It wasn't Michael.

1332
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:50,626
It's not about you.

1333
01:21:51,711 --> 01:21:53,421
- Doctor, get back in the car!
- No!

1334
01:21:53,463 --> 01:21:55,590
I'm still gonna blow
this motherfucker's brains out.

1335
01:21:56,924 --> 01:21:58,968
Mom! Mom!

1336
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:01,220
Help!

1337
01:22:02,597 --> 01:22:05,433
He's a six-year-old boy
with the strength of a man

1338
01:22:05,475 --> 01:22:07,185
and the mind of an animal.

1339
01:22:07,226 --> 01:22:09,354
I know. I've seen his face.

1340
01:22:09,395 --> 01:22:12,607
I looked in his eyes
when I took off his mask.

1341
01:22:12,649 --> 01:22:14,942
Did you know that
when he was a little boy

1342
01:22:14,984 --> 01:22:18,237
he used to stand
in his sister's bedroom and...

1343
01:22:18,279 --> 01:22:20,448
stare out the window?

1344
01:22:20,490 --> 01:22:22,575
My partner died

1345
01:22:22,617 --> 01:22:25,203
the night he stood
on that same spot.

1346
01:22:25,244 --> 01:22:27,413
But for an instant,

1347
01:22:27,455 --> 01:22:30,667
before his death, he knew.

1348
01:22:30,708 --> 01:22:33,461
Maybe he wasn't looking out.

1349
01:22:34,879 --> 01:22:36,923
Maybe he was looking in.

1350
01:22:38,508 --> 01:22:40,259
At his reflection.

1351
01:22:40,301 --> 01:22:42,095
At himself.

1352
01:22:43,012 --> 01:22:46,683
Who knows what makes him kill,
what motivates him?

1353
01:22:46,724 --> 01:22:52,021
But in his heart,
it always seemed to me

1354
01:22:52,063 --> 01:22:54,941
he wants one thing.

1355
01:22:54,983 --> 01:22:57,568
He's going home.

1356
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:59,612
- He went from Laurie's compound...
- Mm-hmm.

1357
01:22:59,654 --> 01:23:01,489
...the victims
in her neighborhood,

1358
01:23:01,531 --> 01:23:03,199
to the park, okay?

1359
01:23:03,241 --> 01:23:06,202
If you track those locations,
that's a straight line,

1360
01:23:06,244 --> 01:23:08,329
basically an arrow
pointing straight

1361
01:23:08,371 --> 01:23:11,749
to Lampkin Lane,
Michael's childhood home.

1362
01:23:11,791 --> 01:23:15,712
I came face-to-face with
this asshole when I was a kid.

1363
01:23:15,753 --> 01:23:19,882
He creeps, he kills,
he goes home.

1364
01:23:23,386 --> 01:23:26,014
Then that's where we're going.

1365
01:23:26,055 --> 01:23:27,724
Yeah.

1366
01:23:35,231 --> 01:23:37,108
Karen. Karen.

1367
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:38,359
Listen, I'm sorry.

1368
01:23:38,401 --> 01:23:39,902
You were right, okay?
I'm sorry.

1369
01:23:39,944 --> 01:23:43,031
Tommy, you took my daughter
to chase a killer,

1370
01:23:43,072 --> 01:23:45,074
and an innocent man is dead.

1371
01:23:45,116 --> 01:23:47,201
Fuck it.
None of us are innocent.

1372
01:23:47,243 --> 01:23:49,412
Karen, listen. Listen.
I fucked up.

1373
01:23:49,454 --> 01:23:50,913
I fucked up. I'm sorry.

1374
01:23:50,955 --> 01:23:52,623
So, what now?

1375
01:23:52,665 --> 01:23:55,001
You're sorry? You're just gonna
stand here hating yourself?

1376
01:23:55,043 --> 01:23:56,169
No.

1377
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:58,212
I got to keep trying.

1378
01:23:58,254 --> 01:23:59,714
But if I go down,

1379
01:23:59,756 --> 01:24:02,175
I'm gonna go down swinging.

1380
01:24:05,053 --> 01:24:06,929
I need a car.

1381
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:09,641
I have a car.

1382
01:24:29,369 --> 01:24:32,080
Okay, so the key is
we stick together.

1383
01:24:32,121 --> 01:24:33,748
No, I'm going in alone.

1384
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:35,416
- What?
- Mr. Elam.

1385
01:24:35,458 --> 01:24:37,293
You fucking dummy,
you brought your kid

1386
01:24:37,335 --> 01:24:39,170
- to the belly of the beast.
- Dad, no.

1387
01:24:39,212 --> 01:24:40,838
Mr. Elam, with all due respect,

1388
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,091
you really expect me
to sit here while you go inside

1389
01:24:43,132 --> 01:24:45,093
and confront the man
that killed my father?

1390
01:24:45,134 --> 01:24:47,512
No, I don't expect you to.

1391
01:24:47,553 --> 01:24:49,764
But I'm asking, Allyson.

1392
01:24:49,806 --> 01:24:52,100
For your sake and my son's.

1393
01:24:52,141 --> 01:24:54,936
Okay? Just stay here.

1394
01:24:54,978 --> 01:24:59,440
You see anything suspicious,
you honk the horn, all right?

1395
01:24:59,482 --> 01:25:01,776
But you stay safe.

1396
01:25:01,818 --> 01:25:03,569
All right?

1397
01:25:07,991 --> 01:25:10,702
I will see you
at the finish line, buddy.

1398
01:26:06,966 --> 01:26:08,551
Okay.

1399
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
This is so fucked up.
Cameron, let's go.

1400
01:26:27,153 --> 01:26:29,113
Come on.

1401
01:26:29,155 --> 01:26:30,239
Go, go, go, go!

1402
01:26:38,623 --> 01:26:41,000
Okay.

1403
01:26:51,427 --> 01:26:53,179
Dad?

1404
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:05,066
Allyson.

1405
01:27:05,108 --> 01:27:06,943

Dad.

Cameron?

Allyson!

No.

Come and get me.

1442
01:31:24,492 --> 01:31:25,618
Leave him alone!

1443
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:28,913
No.

1444
01:31:28,955 --> 01:31:30,790
No. No!

1445
01:31:30,832 --> 01:31:33,167
No!

1446
01:31:37,338 --> 01:31:39,048
No!

1447
01:31:51,519 --> 01:31:54,063
Do it. Do it.

1448
01:31:54,856 --> 01:31:56,316
Do it!

1449
01:32:16,502 --> 01:32:18,171
Mom.

1450
01:32:31,309 --> 01:32:33,269
Mom.

1451
01:32:39,776 --> 01:32:41,069
No, Mom.

1452
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:42,570
You want your mask?

1453
01:32:42,612 --> 01:32:44,030
Come and get it!

1454
01:32:44,072 --> 01:32:46,908
You want to fucking
kill someone, take me!

1455

Mom. No, Mom.

1456
01:32:52,914 --> 01:32:54,874
I'm an innocent woman,

1457
01:32:54,916 --> 01:32:56,918
just like your sister was.

1458
01:32:56,959 --> 01:32:58,961
It was Halloween night.

1459
01:32:59,003 --> 01:33:00,880
She was in her bedroom.

1460
01:33:00,922 --> 01:33:03,091
And it was right here.

1461
01:33:03,132 --> 01:33:05,009
Your house.

1462
01:33:05,051 --> 01:33:07,929
Can't you feel it?

1463
01:33:07,971 --> 01:33:09,931
No. No, Mom.

1464
01:33:13,017 --> 01:33:15,103
Mom, no.

1465
01:33:22,235 --> 01:33:24,988
Mom!

1466
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:05,194
Gotcha.

1467
01:34:16,831 --> 01:34:18,791
Hey, Michael.

1468
01:34:18,833 --> 01:34:20,418
It's Halloween.

1469
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:23,588
Everyone's entitled
to one good scare.

1470
01:35:04,462 --> 01:35:07,674
- Light him up.
- Let's take him.

1471
01:35:48,965 --> 01:35:50,550
We got this, Karen.

1472
01:35:51,968 --> 01:35:54,220
Go be with your daughter.

1473
01:36:18,202 --> 01:36:20,204
I always thought Michael Myers

1474
01:36:20,246 --> 01:36:24,292
was flesh and blood,
just like you and me,

1475
01:36:24,334 --> 01:36:26,169
but a mortal man
could not have survived

1476
01:36:26,210 --> 01:36:27,712
what he's lived through.

1477
01:36:28,921 --> 01:36:31,049
The more he kills,

1478
01:36:31,090 --> 01:36:32,800
the more he transcends

1479
01:36:32,842 --> 01:36:36,471
into something else
impossible to defeat.

1480
01:36:36,512 --> 01:36:38,181
Fear.

1481
01:36:38,222 --> 01:36:40,183
People are afraid.

1482
01:36:40,224 --> 01:36:43,561
That is the true curse
of Michael.

1483
01:36:43,603 --> 01:36:46,314
He'll always be here, won't he?

1484
01:36:46,356 --> 01:36:48,524
Even when we can't see him.

1485
01:36:54,572 --> 01:36:56,866
You can't defeat it
with brute force.

1486
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
If we only knew then
what we know now.

1487
01:37:39,617 --> 01:37:41,869
It is the essence of evil.

1488
01:37:43,955 --> 01:37:45,873
The anchor that divides us.

1489
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:50,920
It is the terror that grows
stronger when we try to hide.

1490
01:38:24,203 --> 01:38:26,748
If they don't stop him tonight,

1491
01:38:26,789 --> 01:38:29,083
maybe we'll find him tomorrow.

1492
01:38:29,125 --> 01:38:30,668
Or next Halloween,

1493
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:34,339
when the sun sets
and someone is alone.

1494
01:39:10,875 --> 01:39:14,462
You can't close your eyes
and pretend he isn't there.

1495
01:39:19,509 --> 01:39:21,803
Because he is.

1496
