1
00:03:16,502 --> 00:03:18,413
Are you hungry? Let's just wait for...

2
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,000
Why?

3
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:50,599
You think I'm stupid, don't you?

4
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,939
Where did you go again?

5
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:00,614
I didn't leave.

6
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:07,870
Liar! Don't lie to me! I was
calling here and no one answered!

7
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,043
I just bought...

8
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,455
Idiot! Stupid! Don't take me as a fool!

9
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:26,824
I know you have a lover in this
building! Admit it! You animal!

10
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,155
What?

11
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,763
Will you stop?

12
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

13
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

14
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:34,345
You're too much! I thought it was
something else.

15
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:36,417
Why? Who else were you expecting?

16
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:42,722
- No one.
- No one? You were expecting someone, eh?

17
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:45,386
No one really. That's why I was surprised.

18
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:51,596
You've been here two weeks and
you're not done fixing it up yet?

19
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:55,668
Lack of money.

20
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:58,571
Then borrow from our bank.
My boss is easy to talk to.

21
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:03,767
Or agree to my moving in
and I'll share my salary.

22
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:07,845
Who will take care of
your younger siblings?

23
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:13,320
Let's not complicate things. I all ready
argued with my mom about this.

24
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:17,553
Isn't she proud? Her only child is so
independent, he bought his own unit.

25
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:26,430
She says it's wrong. My savings, even
the money dad left went to this.

26
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:29,671
Show her it's the right decision.

27
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:36,136
That's why. Now I'll just make do.

28
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:43,782
Daddy's coming back next week.
I'll tell him I'm staying here.

29
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:46,848
I wish it was that easy.

30
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:53,050
You know, let's plan this.

31
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:55,669
Okay. Let's just take our time.

32
00:08:57,615 --> 00:09:00,960
Oh, well. Just tell me when you're free.

33
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:17,271
What's this? You'll have to change
this bed too, okay?

34
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:20,382
I wonder who last slept here?

35
00:09:20,438 --> 00:09:21,580
.Why?
- It's ugly-

36
00:09:22,107 --> 00:09:23,279
- It's beautiful!
- It's ugly.

37
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:25,647
And it's free.

38
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:28,287
You know, you...you, meddler.

39
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,260
Ouch! I think my vein split.

40
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:40,932
Stop it! Someone might complain
because we're always noisy.

41
00:09:45,664 --> 00:09:47,867
So, now what? You're in unit nine?

42
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:51,291
Yep. Seventh floor unit nine.

43
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:55,974
You should have gotten a unit on the
seventh floor. So it's lucky 777.

44
00:09:57,042 --> 00:10:01,522
I think what's lucky is 888.
Try looking, so we'll know.

45
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:04,117
I can't sleep, it's too noisy!

46
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:18,572
The noises don't stop.
I keep complaining to the admin.

47
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:22,710
I look like a fool.
There's no guard to talk to.

48
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:25,374
The caretaker's always drunk. Shit!

49
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:28,707
I'll complain about you to the admin.

50
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:34,279
Don't mess around.

51
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:54,233
I'm going to eat.

52
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:14,457
Hi!

53
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:19,681
Hello!

54
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:02,105
(Screams)

55
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:44,329
(Angry man yelling)

56
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

57
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:21,457
You look like you haven't slept yet.
Who did you dream about last night?

58
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:26,664
No, man. It's just really noisy
where I moved.

59
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:36,135
Who's there?

60
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:53,381
Who's there?

61
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:57,151
Help us.

62
00:18:57,782 --> 00:18:59,352
Who's there and what do you need?

63
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:03,299
Help us, please.

64
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:05,158
I don't want trouble.

65
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,563
Have pity on us.

66
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:28,817
Maybe the child can stay here for a
while. I want her to be safe.

67
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:32,726
Your husband might get angry.

68
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,150
Please...

69
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:40,563
When he beats me, he also
beats her.

70
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,236
My husband's about to come home.
Maybe she can

71
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:45,058
stay here when there's
trouble in our place.

72
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,472
What if he looks for her?

73
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:56,680
The building's big,
there's many places to hide in.

74
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:58,715
I'll say she's playing.

75
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,039
Please.

76
00:20:01,713 --> 00:20:04,091
It's really just for a short while.

77
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:06,624
Until what time?

78
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:10,565
I'll get her after
my husband falls asleep.

79
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:13,789
Please.

80
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,530
She's nice. Quiet.

81
00:20:25,103 --> 00:20:27,048
Has she eaten?

82
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:32,852
Lara. Her name's Lara. I'm Anna.

83
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:35,956
Jude.

84
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:43,521
We've eaten. Thank you very, very
much, Jude.

85
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:49,766
Go, go.

86
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:04,917
What are you doing here?

87
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,853
I'm just looking for Lara.

88
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,122
Where's the child?

89
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:16,092
I know you have a lover
in this building!

90
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:17,828
Lara. ls your name Lara?

91
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:22,671
You're going to escape, aren't you?
Are you fooling me?

92
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:26,071
You're using the child
for your foolishness!

93
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:30,211
Stop it, Bert. I was just
looking for Lara.

94
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:33,548
Lara, this is just a game, okay?

95
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,380
Hide and seek.
You can come out from there.

96
00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:43,753
They can't reach you here. Your dad
won't know you're here.

97
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:49,026
Are you lying to me? Are you fooling me?

98
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,750
(Woman screaming)

99
00:22:16,974 --> 00:22:18,974
(Gun shot)

100
00:22:37,235 --> 00:22:41,581
Lara, come out here. You want to eat?

101
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:48,385
Lara, where are you going? Lara, wait!

102
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,781
What's a little noise?

103
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:28,049
It's too noisy.
The fighting is too much.

104
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:31,153
Don't mind it. Sit down.

105
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:34,961
I'm not getting my money's worth
here, Dante.

106
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,458
Won't the building's
management intervene?

107
00:24:39,324 --> 00:24:44,069
Don't meddle, and no one will
meddle with you.

108
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:45,806
Just drink.

109
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,046
That's why a lot of tenants leave.

110
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,175
It looks like I got a bad deal here, Dante.

111
00:24:55,273 --> 00:24:57,947
A bad deal? You got
the unit very cheap.

112
00:24:59,644 --> 00:25:04,024
It's better that there's
only a few tenants. More privacy.

113
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:08,464
There's privacy, but no security.

114
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:17,305
There's fewer of you,
less association dues.

115
00:25:18,296 --> 00:25:22,039
We can't afford overnight security.

116
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,138
I'm here!

117
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:28,580
Go, go, go! Go up!

118
00:25:30,775 --> 00:25:33,756
Just think you're not hearing anything.

119
00:28:27,185 --> 00:28:31,099
Man, why do you always lack sleep?

120
00:28:34,623 --> 00:28:36,623
Hey, Marvin!

121
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:39,147
Sorry. What?

122
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:42,735
I was asking why you
always lack sleep.

123
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:48,012
Yes, just getting used to the house.
I can't sleep in the apartment.

124
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:51,280
Is it noisy again?

125
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:53,412
Yes.

126
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:55,936
Aside from that...

127
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:57,924
And my dreams are weird.

128
00:29:00,252 --> 00:29:08,252
Man, even I would be afraid. That place
is scary. Maybe it's haunted?

129
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:14,342
I don't know. Maybe not.

130
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,036
What if it is?

131
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,610
I don't believe in ghosts.

132
00:29:33,184 --> 00:29:37,223
Man, who's that behind you?

133
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:44,773
Asshole, don't joke like that.

134
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,208
Man, this is okay.

135
00:30:40,452 --> 00:30:42,728
What's with you? You scared me.

136
00:30:45,457 --> 00:30:47,198
You surprised me.

137
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:51,099
Just wanted to kiss you.

138
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,568
Your door was open.

139
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:59,042
I locked it...or didn't I?

140
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,376
Obviously, you didn't.

141
00:31:03,141 --> 00:31:08,614
Wait, what's your problem? Why are
you becoming forgetful?

142
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:12,723
Nothing, just lack of sleep. I was
fixing things up last night.

143
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:18,600
Anyway, get dressed. Let's go out.

144
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:21,730
- Where are we going?
- Just get dressed. Come on.

145
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:25,197
Let's go, get up!

146
00:31:26,131 --> 00:31:27,701
Daddy's best friend is a lawyer.

147
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:32,010
We can demand that your payment for
your unit be refunded.

148
00:31:32,404 --> 00:31:33,940
Just look for another place.

149
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:37,278
You're becoming a nag.
I all ready like my unit.

150
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:39,746
It's just noisy sometimes.

151
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:42,417
You're the one who's complaining.

152
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,858
I just said it's noisy
and you're insulting me.

153
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:49,257
What insult? Who's insulting you?

154
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:51,264
You're criticizing my unit!

155
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,868
Did I say anything like that?

156
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:55,371
Isn't that the same?

157
00:31:56,594 --> 00:32:00,608
You know, Marvin, there should be a
voice recorder whenever we talk.

158
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:02,669
You assume a lot of things.

159
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:05,408
I'm just saying I like my unit.

160
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:12,232
Pinky!

161
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:16,482
Marvin, let's just talk when
your mind is clear.

162
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:27,599
Don't go out from there until I pick
you up, okay?

163
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:32,132
Don't be sad. This will also end.

164
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:39,480
Let's go! You be nice, okay?
Don't move around too much.

165
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:46,217
It's better if you don't just play when
you're there. Sleep too, okay?

166
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:51,492
Don't be afraid of Uncle Jude. He's nice.

167
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:53,961
Smile. There you go!

168
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:14,710
Maybe she can stay here again?

169
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:21,215
Yes.

170
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:24,686
Baby, go in.

171
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:28,592
Thank you very much.

172
00:33:31,823 --> 00:33:33,427
Why don't you leave him?

173
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,570
My husband's a policeman
with many connections.

174
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:41,974
This will be the last time.

175
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:49,745
I'm sorry. But I'm getting nervous.

176
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:53,422
Can you bring her to
another unit next time?

177
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:57,325
I should be the one saying sorry to you.

178
00:33:57,349 --> 00:34:01,491
Don't worry, next time I'll bring Lara
to the next unit.

179
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,124
Go, go!

180
00:34:22,307 --> 00:34:24,311
How long since you finished
that doll house?

181
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:30,386
You want to live here? Don't go back
to your house anymore.

182
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,422
Let's play hide and seek!
I'll be the seeker.

183
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:44,546
(Gun shot)

184
00:34:46,866 --> 00:34:49,377
Lara, where are you going? Wait!

185
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:51,501
Lara!

186
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,070
Lara!

187
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:55,117
Don't go there! It's dangerous!

188
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:31,114
Bert. Bert, that's enough.
You're just drunk.

189
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,356
- Come here! Are you hungry?
- Me? Drunk? No!

190
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,525
- I'm not hungry.
- Let's just rest.

191
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:40,155
- You want this? You want this?
- No! No!

192
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:43,797
- You want this?
- No! No! Bert!

193
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,361
Let's sleep. Why don't you rest?

194
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:50,472
Come, rest! Or maybe you're hungry?

195
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:54,742
Stupid! You, too!

196
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:56,712
Bert! Don't mind her! Don't!

197
00:35:56,736 --> 00:35:58,736
Bert! Bert!

198
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:39,114
- Mom!

199
00:38:28,238 --> 00:38:30,238
It's Pinky!

200
00:38:30,422 --> 00:38:34,165
- Hasn't she come down yet?
- I don't think she went to work.

201
00:38:36,628 --> 00:38:38,232
Why don't you make up?

202
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:46,147
She doesn't answer my texts
and calls. Bye.

203
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:43,271
Up? Up?

204
00:41:21,226 --> 00:41:22,503
Did Pinky call?

205
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:25,531
No, sir. I've been here
since lunch, no calls.

206
00:43:44,569 --> 00:43:45,874
You're just here.

207
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:51,387
That's why you don't want
me to move in, huh?

208
00:43:53,378 --> 00:43:54,982
What?

209
00:43:55,814 --> 00:43:57,623
Your woman's waiting for you.

210
00:43:59,184 --> 00:44:01,391
Don't be silly.

211
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:04,359
I'm silly?

212
00:44:05,857 --> 00:44:08,235
You came here to fight with me?

213
00:44:09,728 --> 00:44:12,607
There was a woman outside earlier,
waiting for you.

214
00:44:12,631 --> 00:44:14,109
Long-haired.

215
00:44:17,302 --> 00:44:20,078
Maybe it's the woman next door who's
always knocking.

216
00:44:21,373 --> 00:44:22,750
Why would she knock?

217
00:44:25,644 --> 00:44:30,258
There's a couple in the other unit who
is always fighting.

218
00:44:30,282 --> 00:44:33,694
Sometimes the woman comes around,
knocking at the apartments.

219
00:44:33,718 --> 00:44:35,527
Asking for help.

220
00:44:35,954 --> 00:44:37,729
Are you pulling my leg?

221
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:43,439
That's the noise I've been
telling you about.

222
00:44:46,298 --> 00:44:48,175
I ignore her even when
she keeps knocking.

223
00:44:53,499 --> 00:44:56,999
Pinky, please.

224
00:44:57,023 --> 00:44:59,023
Sorry, okay?

225
00:45:00,011 --> 00:45:01,649
Sorry I was short-tempered.

226
00:45:03,215 --> 00:45:06,856
That's all right, okay?
Don't interfere with them.

227
00:45:06,952 --> 00:45:08,625
If she insists, call the caretaker.

228
00:45:12,249 --> 00:45:14,249
Sorry.

229
00:45:20,273 --> 00:45:22,273
Sorry too.

230
00:45:34,713 --> 00:45:37,785
- I'll bring you home.
- No, I brought daddy's car.

231
00:45:38,016 --> 00:45:40,929
- I'll walk you down.
- No, you didn't even close your door.

232
00:45:43,421 --> 00:45:44,690
Okay, you take care.

233
00:45:44,756 --> 00:45:49,704
You take more care, there's a
woman who's always knocking.

234
00:45:49,728 --> 00:45:52,334
I don't want to be beaten up
by a policeman.

235
00:45:52,771 --> 00:45:54,114
I'll go ahead. Bye.

236
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

237
00:47:05,837 --> 00:47:07,783
This elevator is probably
older than me.

238
00:47:11,242 --> 00:47:14,416
They say older is safer.

239
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:34,496
The elevator's big,
there's lots of space.

240
00:48:35,894 --> 00:48:37,931
What about the blood I saw on her head?

241
00:48:39,798 --> 00:48:42,744
Ketchup. Maybe it's ketchup.

242
00:48:42,768 --> 00:48:48,616
Ketchup? Why would the child put
ketchup on her head? Are you silly?

243
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,640
Come on, Pinky.

244
00:48:51,743 --> 00:48:54,053
Don't mind it, okay?

245
00:48:55,777 --> 00:48:58,777
Oh my, I don't know any more.

246
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:00,051
I know what I saw.

247
00:49:00,052 --> 00:49:01,998
Why would I make up a story?

248
00:49:02,754 --> 00:49:07,169
Don't mind it. That child is naughty.
She likes to play.

249
00:49:07,693 --> 00:49:10,640
Hide and seek. She always appears
out of nowhere.

250
00:49:12,264 --> 00:49:14,264
Okay.

251
00:49:14,366 --> 00:49:16,511
Let's just talk again later.

252
00:49:16,635 --> 00:49:20,235
- Yes, love you. - Okay, love you. Bye.

253
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:57,038
Has your husband left?

254
00:49:57,169 --> 00:50:01,242
He already left. This will be the
last time. Help us escape.

255
00:50:03,142 --> 00:50:06,888
I'm feeling brave now.
You're the only one I can trust.

256
00:50:06,912 --> 00:50:10,155
I don't know anyone in Manila.
I have no one else to turn to.

257
00:50:11,116 --> 00:50:12,794
Where will you go?

258
00:50:12,818 --> 00:50:16,322
Maybe you know a place where we
can hide. Anywhere.

259
00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:20,802
I can't take it anymore. He fired the
gun the last time.

260
00:50:20,826 --> 00:50:22,737
I don't know what will happen next.

261
00:50:22,995 --> 00:50:26,374
Have pity, please.
This will be the last time.

262
00:50:28,667 --> 00:50:33,248
Okay, let's see tomorrow. Just knock
when it's safe.

263
00:50:33,272 --> 00:50:35,309
As soon as he leaves.

264
00:50:35,941 --> 00:50:39,946
Thank you, thank you.
I'll just knock, okay?

265
00:51:51,683 --> 00:51:55,694
It's too much! My neighbor makes
noise every night.

266
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:57,801
The wife gets beaten up every night.

267
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,158
Did you see them, man?

268
00:52:00,759 --> 00:52:03,933
Even if I don't see them,
I hear the shouts.

269
00:52:04,096 --> 00:52:05,734
Cool!

270
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,970
Poor woman.

271
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:12,507
What do the neighbors say?

272
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,531
I don't know.

273
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:18,915
Some have already left.

274
00:52:20,279 --> 00:52:22,816
Why don't you move?

275
00:52:23,382 --> 00:52:25,862
Can't. I all ready bought the unit.

276
00:52:27,453 --> 00:52:28,961
Why don't you sell it?

277
00:52:31,223 --> 00:52:33,169
It's not that simple.

278
00:52:34,226 --> 00:52:35,734
Why don't you report it?

279
00:52:37,129 --> 00:52:43,171
To whom? I told you our
caretaker's a drunkard.

280
00:52:44,603 --> 00:52:45,911
Report it to the police.

281
00:52:48,073 --> 00:52:51,586
Can't. The husband's a policeman.

282
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,487
Shit, man. Don't meddle.

283
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:55,511
Mind your own business.

284
00:53:03,922 --> 00:53:07,631
Pitiful mother and child.

285
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:17,578
- Why are we here?
- I'll just show you the condo unit.

286
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,811
Who said I was looking for a condo?

287
00:53:20,706 --> 00:53:24,210
Just take a look. You might like it.
It's just an option.

288
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,886
I don't have money to get another.

289
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:35,890
I'll share. Marvin, this is for us.
It's new.

290
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:38,127
What do you think of the one I got?

291
00:53:40,526 --> 00:53:43,973
You're the one who said it was
noisy and unsafe, right?

292
00:53:45,497 --> 00:53:51,880
You can't make me move. Neither you
nor mommy can convince me. Let's go.

293
00:53:55,708 --> 00:53:57,049
Okay.

294
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:30,586
That's a lot. Who's going
to eat that, man?

295
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,384
I'm sorry?

296
00:54:34,213 --> 00:54:36,716
How many times have you visited Anna?

297
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,140
Sir?

298
00:54:42,287 --> 00:54:46,793
I've had it. You're seeing my wife?

299
00:54:49,127 --> 00:54:53,007
You plan to steal her from me?
You're brave, huh?

300
00:54:56,535 --> 00:54:59,675
I don't want trouble, sir.

301
00:55:00,973 --> 00:55:02,418
I don't want trouble, too.

302
00:55:04,977 --> 00:55:10,154
But my wife is stupid!
She'll go with any man!

303
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:17,459
She goes to you, doesn't she?
Every night? When I'm not here!

304
00:55:20,225 --> 00:55:22,865
Sir, that's not true, sir.

305
00:55:24,296 --> 00:55:27,209
That's why I don't like the child.

306
00:55:29,134 --> 00:55:31,580
My hunch is that she's not even mine.

307
00:55:33,572 --> 00:55:35,245
Is Lara your child?

308
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:40,513
Sir, I'm just new here, sir.

309
00:55:46,518 --> 00:55:49,829
That child doesn't look like me.

310
00:55:56,194 --> 00:55:57,730
You look like her, hmm?

311
00:56:02,301 --> 00:56:04,076
Hey! This isn't your floor!

312
00:56:06,605 --> 00:56:08,243
I have eyes everywhere!

313
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,114
You can't escape!

314
00:56:15,881 --> 00:56:19,693
I'll kill them both! And I'll
include you, asshole!

315
00:56:40,172 --> 00:56:44,019
- What are you doing outside?
- Bert, I'm just looking for Lara.

316
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:48,751
- You're going to escape?
- It's not like that.

317
00:56:51,218 --> 00:56:54,222
- Where's the kid?
- She went out.

318
00:56:55,655 --> 00:56:57,896
Are you lying to me?

319
00:56:58,292 --> 00:57:00,966
- You're using the child for your
foolishness, aren't you?

320
00:57:01,094 --> 00:57:02,531
Stop it, Bert.

321
00:57:02,929 --> 00:57:06,342
Are you lying to me? Are you
making a fool of me?

322
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:10,448
I was just looking for Lara.

323
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:16,685
You fool! You idiot! Don't make
me look stupid!

324
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:21,884
You have a lover in this building!
Admit it, you animal!

325
00:57:36,408 --> 00:57:39,008
Jude! Jude! Jude!...

326
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:43,740
Open the door! Jude, have pity on us!

327
00:57:48,442 --> 00:57:50,217
Open the door! Jude!

328
00:57:50,241 --> 00:57:52,241
Jude! Jude!

329
00:57:57,484 --> 00:57:59,964
They're making noises again.

330
00:58:00,587 --> 00:58:02,464
She's knocking on my door!

331
00:58:04,124 --> 00:58:05,762
Have pity on me and Lara!

332
00:58:08,086 --> 00:58:10,086
Jude!

333
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:13,010
Jude!

334
00:58:13,834 --> 00:58:16,234
Jude!

335
00:58:16,658 --> 00:58:19,258
Jude! Jude! Please!

336
00:58:24,382 --> 00:58:26,382
Jude, please!

337
00:58:29,182 --> 00:58:31,423
Have pity on me and Lara!

338
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:33,824
Jude, open the door!

339
00:58:37,448 --> 00:58:39,448
Jude! Jude!

340
00:58:42,972 --> 00:58:49,372
Jude! Jude! Jude, please! Jude!...

341
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,978
Jude, open the door!

342
00:59:18,131 --> 00:59:19,641
Come here!

343
00:59:26,306 --> 00:59:27,944
Come here.

344
00:59:30,277 --> 00:59:33,115
Jude, open the door! Jude...

345
01:03:53,108 --> 01:03:59,956
- What is my unit number, Dante?
- Unit 6! 7th floor, unit 6! Why?

346
01:04:03,413 --> 01:04:05,413
(Gun shot)

347
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:21,404
- She needs help!
- I said that's foolishness!

348
01:04:21,501 --> 01:04:23,310
The problem with you is
you're hard to talk to.

349
01:04:23,403 --> 01:04:24,579
What, crazy?

350
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:31,582
There's nothing there!

351
01:04:32,779 --> 01:04:34,452
What do you mean, nothing?

352
01:04:41,988 --> 01:04:44,127
There are no people here, Marvin.

353
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,208
There's no one here!

354
01:05:18,191 --> 01:05:20,000
But I saw them, Dante! I really did!

355
01:05:22,395 --> 01:05:25,069
Marvin, you're the only one who lives here
on the 7th floor.

356
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:31,214
It's been a long time
since anyone lived here.

357
01:05:32,005 --> 01:05:34,485
The last tenant left last week.

358
01:05:48,755 --> 01:05:50,329
It's been three years.

359
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:54,561
That's where Anna lived.

360
01:05:56,857 --> 01:06:03,331
Her husband Bert was a policeman,
very possessive.

361
01:06:05,933 --> 01:06:07,003
Their daughter was Lara.

362
01:06:10,704 --> 01:06:17,087
The couple fought every night. The wife
was beaten up, so was the kid.

363
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,992
Bert thought Anna had a lover here.

364
01:06:24,051 --> 01:06:26,190
He thought Lara wasn't his child.

365
01:06:28,089 --> 01:06:32,060
Bert was drunk every night. And there
was a fight every night.

366
01:06:34,762 --> 01:06:36,298
Things got worse.

367
01:06:38,399 --> 01:06:44,475
One night, they chased each
other down the hall.

368
01:06:55,883 --> 01:07:00,093
She asked help from Jude,
another tenant.

369
01:07:03,324 --> 01:07:04,962
Jude, open the door!

370
01:07:08,095 --> 01:07:09,631
He didn't help her.

371
01:07:30,317 --> 01:07:34,094
Bert chased her until they reached
the elevator. He reached her.

372
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,779
She was dragged down the hallway.

373
01:08:21,702 --> 01:08:23,112
She was hit many so times.

374
01:08:24,071 --> 01:08:25,615
Her skull was bashed in.

375
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:45,839
(Lara crying)

376
01:08:46,961 --> 01:08:52,968
The child was chased into the elevator.

377
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:25,068
Her skull was also crushed.
Mother and child were dead.

378
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:31,112
That's where he lived. Jude,
whom Anna asked help.

379
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:36,450
Exactly where your apartment is.

380
01:09:42,817 --> 01:09:47,493
But the gunshot earlier.
You heard it too, right?

381
01:09:49,056 --> 01:09:55,871
I can hear all the noises you hear
when I'm downstairs or here.

382
01:09:57,999 --> 01:10:01,105
It repeats. Every night.

383
01:10:03,871 --> 01:10:05,179
That' why I just drink.

384
01:10:08,142 --> 01:10:09,678
The husband committed suicide.

385
01:10:10,745 --> 01:10:14,955
He shot himself in the mouth.
That's what we heard earlier.

386
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:20,279
(Gun shot)

387
01:10:21,188 --> 01:10:22,862
Where's the man she asked help from?

388
01:10:25,626 --> 01:10:29,699
He left right after the investigation.

389
01:10:32,733 --> 01:10:34,076
What will I do, Dante?

390
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:39,881
Don't meddle.

391
01:10:42,877 --> 01:10:45,949
Give yourself courage.

392
01:10:56,924 --> 01:10:58,301
He should have helped her.

393
01:11:00,127 --> 01:11:01,800
He should have opened the door.

394
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:09,314
Then his skull would have
been crushed too!

395
01:11:45,339 --> 01:11:48,183
What? You thought you could
make a fool of me?

396
01:11:50,911 --> 01:11:52,754
Where are you going?

397
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,992
You thought I didn't know? Admit it!

398
01:12:02,523 --> 01:12:07,370
It's just noise. It happened,
it's finished.

399
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

400
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:48,976
Don't meddle!

401
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,700
Jude! Jude! Open the door!...

402
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:03,456
-No one lives here, no one lives here.
They're not here anymore. - Jude!

403
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,080
Jude, please!

404
01:13:22,536 --> 01:13:24,311
No one's here.

405
01:13:25,005 --> 01:13:26,609
I'm the only one who lives here.

406
01:13:36,317 --> 01:13:38,092
There's no one else here.

407
01:13:40,221 --> 01:13:42,667
They're not here anymore,
they're not here anymore.

408
01:13:49,697 --> 01:13:51,404
There's no one else here.

409
01:13:51,699 --> 01:13:54,076
There's no one else here.
No one else lives here.

410
01:14:37,745 --> 01:14:42,421
What's your problem, Marvin?
Are you sick?

411
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:44,919
No, Ma. I'm okay.

412
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:48,161
May I sleep here?

413
01:14:48,356 --> 01:14:53,305
May I sleep here? This is still your
home, remember.

414
01:14:54,195 --> 01:14:55,799
Why do you look so tired?

415
01:14:57,431 --> 01:15:00,537
It's nothing. I haven't slept because
I've been fixing the apartment.

416
01:15:01,502 --> 01:15:04,449
Cleaning. Painting.

417
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,913
You don't need paint here.

418
01:15:09,937 --> 01:15:11,937
Ma, let's not start. Okay?

419
01:15:15,149 --> 01:15:17,459
Paint is poisonous. Do you have a mask?

420
01:15:22,623 --> 01:15:24,227
Is my room still okay, Ma?

421
01:15:24,825 --> 01:15:27,066
Just like before. Like you never left it.

422
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:34,777
- I'll stay here for a few days.
- Even a few years is okay with me.

423
01:15:36,201 --> 01:15:38,201
Ma, please.

424
01:16:52,426 --> 01:16:54,126
I can hear you.

425
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:55,383
Sorry, Ma.

426
01:16:56,134 --> 01:16:59,547
Marvin, I know you haven't eaten.

427
01:17:01,726 --> 01:17:03,226
Thanks, Ma.

428
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:07,003
Okay. Just leave it outside when you're
finished, okay?

429
01:17:08,027 --> 01:17:10,027
Okay, Ma.

430
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:36,951
Marvin?

431
01:17:37,275 --> 01:17:39,275
Are you here?

432
01:17:41,468 --> 01:17:43,277
Why aren't you answering your phone?

433
01:17:46,001 --> 01:17:48,001
Are you okay?

434
01:17:49,225 --> 01:17:51,225
Marvin!

435
01:17:54,149 --> 01:17:56,149
Marvin!

436
01:17:56,906 --> 01:17:58,906
Marvin!

437
01:23:23,076 --> 01:23:24,749
What happened to you?

438
01:23:26,112 --> 01:23:29,116
Did your dad find out
about our plans? Asshole!

439
01:23:30,316 --> 01:23:32,990
Marvin, daddy doesn't have
anything to do with this.

440
01:23:34,287 --> 01:23:37,166
Marvin, let's go! He might
think you did this to me.

441
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:39,899
What happened?

442
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:44,467
It's hard to explain. Let's just go.

443
01:23:44,965 --> 01:23:46,375
Tell me!

444
01:23:48,702 --> 01:23:52,878
It's impossible but it did happen.

445
01:23:55,609 --> 01:23:58,215
Let's leave.

446
01:24:09,255 --> 01:24:10,563
Are you okay?

447
01:24:12,459 --> 01:24:14,370
Tell me, Pinky.

448
01:24:16,494 --> 01:24:18,494
Please!

449
01:24:24,638 --> 01:24:26,618
I went to your apartment.

450
01:24:28,641 --> 01:24:33,056
It was open but you weren't there.

451
01:24:35,315 --> 01:24:38,819
I thought you went to that other girl.

452
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:43,443
Pinky, really!

453
01:24:47,694 --> 01:24:50,072
I went to their unit.

454
01:24:52,332 --> 01:24:53,902
I went inside.

455
01:25:48,955 --> 01:25:52,835
What are we going to do?

456
01:25:55,896 --> 01:25:57,398
Let's not talk about it now.

457
01:25:58,832 --> 01:26:00,340
I just want to forget for a while.

458
01:26:02,569 --> 01:26:06,449
I feel like they're following us.

459
01:26:10,076 --> 01:26:11,511
That's impossible.

460
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:15,251
Marvin, the impossible already happened.

461
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:21,225
Pinky, please don't imagine things.

462
01:26:22,856 --> 01:26:24,564
Marvin, I'm not imagining this!

463
01:26:28,762 --> 01:26:36,762
Just think they're not real.
That they're gone.

464
01:26:38,271 --> 01:26:39,773
They're gone.

465
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:05,502
Marvin, Why?

466
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:14,047
Nothing. Let's go.

467
01:27:15,709 --> 01:27:17,313
Let's go.

468
01:27:53,337 --> 01:27:58,337
(Laughing at the movie)

469
01:29:40,887 --> 01:29:42,422
I'll just go to the comfort room.

470
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:47,346
Babe, excuse me.

471
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:29,070
Wash your hands.

472
01:30:29,236 --> 01:30:31,079
I'm sorry.

473
01:30:34,903 --> 01:30:36,903
It's okay.

474
01:31:03,536 --> 01:31:05,880
Someone's here.

475
01:31:08,241 --> 01:31:09,278
Someone's here!

476
01:31:56,002 --> 01:32:01,802
(Pinky screams...)

477
01:32:08,468 --> 01:32:10,072
Let's not be beaten.

478
01:32:11,772 --> 01:32:13,915
They're not going to leave us alone.

479
01:32:14,107 --> 01:32:16,109
They're not going to let us go.

480
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:18,551
Don't be afraid.

481
01:32:20,313 --> 01:32:21,724
What do they need from us?

482
01:32:21,748 --> 01:32:24,092
We don't know them, right?

483
01:32:25,352 --> 01:32:27,930
How come? What do they need from us?

484
01:32:27,954 --> 01:32:29,189
I don't know!

485
01:32:30,156 --> 01:32:31,700
What do they need?

486
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:35,102
I don't know.

487
01:32:40,633 --> 01:32:42,135
This has to stop.

488
01:32:44,171 --> 01:32:45,649
How?

489
01:32:49,042 --> 01:32:50,715
Fear is what will kill us.

490
01:32:52,746 --> 01:32:54,748
We can't be afraid.

491
01:32:57,384 --> 01:33:01,992
How will we fight them? They're
already dead, right?

492
01:33:02,055 --> 01:33:04,057
I won't let them control my life.

493
01:33:04,991 --> 01:33:07,597
You're being affected. They hurt you,
Pinky!

494
01:33:13,033 --> 01:33:15,138
You're taking me home?

495
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:19,141
We'll explain everything to your dad.

496
01:33:20,107 --> 01:33:21,551
And then?

497
01:33:23,944 --> 01:33:25,355
I have to finish this now.

498
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,086
Marvin, what are you talking about?

499
01:33:30,517 --> 01:33:32,519
Let's talk to your dad, Pinky.

500
01:33:32,543 --> 01:33:34,543
Please!

501
01:33:43,096 --> 01:33:45,633
Leave now or I'll call the police!

502
01:33:47,357 --> 01:33:49,157
Understand!

503
01:33:49,269 --> 01:33:53,012
Don't show your face here, ever!

504
01:33:53,036 --> 01:33:54,836
Don't even attempt

505
01:33:54,837 --> 01:33:57,359
to be a kilometer near Pinky.

506
01:33:58,360 --> 01:33:59,860
Dad, please.

507
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:01,050
Leave now!

508
01:34:01,274 --> 01:34:03,274
Dad!

509
01:34:03,298 --> 01:34:05,298
Marvin, I'm sorry.

510
01:34:05,322 --> 01:34:07,322
I'm so sorry, Marvin.

511
01:34:07,346 --> 01:34:09,346
Dad!

512
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:12,170
Pinky.

513
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:15,470
I love you.

514
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:19,594
Sorry, sir.

515
01:34:19,618 --> 01:34:20,700
Ma'am.

516
01:34:21,201 --> 01:34:23,807
I'm sorry for what happened.

517
01:34:27,073 --> 01:34:30,179
- Marvin, no!
- You don't have to be part of this!

518
01:34:30,203 --> 01:34:31,510
Marvin!

519
01:34:31,511 --> 01:34:33,149
I'm going to finish this.

520
01:34:33,173 --> 01:34:35,173
Marvin!

521
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

522
01:36:16,483 --> 01:36:18,190
Jude! Help us! Jude!

523
01:36:19,686 --> 01:36:22,223
Open the door, Jude!

524
01:37:22,449 --> 01:37:26,659
Open the door. Help Us.

525
01:37:59,283 --> 01:38:03,283
(Angry man's voice)

526
01:38:06,993 --> 01:38:09,672
Are you making a fool of me?

527
01:38:09,696 --> 01:38:12,233
You're using the kid for your
foolishness!

528
01:38:14,501 --> 01:38:17,914
Are you cheating on me?
Are you cheating on me?

529
01:38:40,338 --> 01:38:47,138
