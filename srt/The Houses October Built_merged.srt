1
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,279
When you go
 to the haunted house
 at Camden Park...

2
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,323
<i>You don't know
 what will happen.</i>

3
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,194
<i>Camden Park!</i>

4
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,538
National Retail Federation
does a poll

5
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,974
and they say
21% of the people,

6
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,976
that's 30
million people a year,

7
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,911
are gonna go to
haunted houses.

8
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,247
For a actor
 in a haunted house

9
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,849
there is no bigger rush
than getting a great scare.

10
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,819
And it could be the biggest,
baddest guy in class
that comes through

11
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,821
that you give that to.

12
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,756
One year,
I think they had, like,
close to 1,200 scare-outs,

13
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,159
where people walk in the door
and halfway through
they said,

14
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,359
"I can't do this anymore,
I'm out, I want out."

15
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,068
Oh...!

16
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,836
- I love Halloween.
- Really?

17
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,273
If I can get you to scream,
then I feel great.

18
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,343
Yeah, I've heard rumors of
people doing things like that.

19
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,645
Yeah.
- Supposedly hiring,
you know, actual...

20
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:56,082
You know, murderers
or something to work
in their haunts.

21
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,217
Things like that,
it's all talk sometimes.

22
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,553
There really is.
I'll show you.
Inside the house,

23
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,254
there's real human remains

24
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,956
inside the haunted house.

25
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,459
Some of the actors
that we have are,
they're pretty far out there.

26
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,760
Would it surprise me
if something happened?

27
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,629
No.

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,575
<i>A Missouri house of horror
became a reality.</i>

29
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,810
<i>Police report
that a 17-year-old employee...</i>

30
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,447
<i>The owner said customers</i>

31
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,351
<i>walked by her thinking
it was part of the show.</i>

32
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,453
I do not want you
all filming in here.

33
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,690
<i>Tonight a 28-year-old
registered sex-offender</i>

34
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,092
<i>was arrested
 at his work place,</i>

35
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,028
<i>a Halloween haunted house.</i>

36
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,164
<i>There was a scare
actor that was employed,</i>

37
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,433
<i>slashed his
whole damn family...</i>

38
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,768
<i>Father and mother and sister,</i>

39
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:49,301
<i>in real life.</i>

40
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:15,461
Get her in the trunk.

41
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,392
This place is great.

42
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,967
- Dude!
- What's up, man?

43
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,001
Good to see you.

44
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:31,704
Hi!

45
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:32,805
What's up, brother?

46
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:33,873
How you all been?

47
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,207
- Bobby?
- Yes.

48
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,910
Mike,
You've already taken over?

49
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,245
How do you feel that I...

50
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,213
How do you drop five
minutes in the trip?

51
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,249
How do you
feel about me being
the better looking brother?

52
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,084
- Zack?
- Yo.

53
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,619
- What's up?
- If he's with us on this trip
I will kill myself.

54
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,487
Tell me about yourself
and what are we doing?

55
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,955
Zack, I'm talking to you.

56
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,390
I think
she's transfixed by Jeff.

57
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,258
You want my name?
My name is Zack.

58
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,028
You've known me
for 20 years, Mikey.

59
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,164
We've rented an RV.
We're going across...

60
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,932
Well, the point is
I want to find the most

61
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,634
extreme haunted house
in the world.

62
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,802
Lady's gonna teach
him how to line dance.

63
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,136
- Congratu-fucking-lations.
- Hey, hey, hey.

64
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,972
Tell me
about you, Brandy.
- Uh...

65
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,041
My name is Brandy
Catherine Shaefer.

66
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,010
Jeffery Bernard Larson.

67
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,845
Jeffery Bernard Larson.
Remember that.

68
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,213
All right, Bobby.

69
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,414
You're my big brother.

70
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,082
I'm the one who
went to film school,

71
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,717
so I deserve to carry
this camera for a bit.

72
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,820
- You didn't graduate.

73
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,087
Did you?

74
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:22,988
This is
where I wanna go.

75
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,091
Yeah, but this
is just a clip of a girl
being strapped.

76
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,159
Did you watch the video?

77
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,494
No.

78
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,196
You're not gonna like it.

79
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:33,599
I'm pretty sure
it's not that scary
if it's on the World Wide Web.

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,867
Mike,
so you're down now?

81
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,369
Yeah, I'm in, man,
like they said there...

82
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,206
I've heard people talk
about the ones
that in New York,

83
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,542
they zip tie you to a chair...
Stop it.

84
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,979
Bags over the head,
that kind of thing.
That's a different story.

85
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,348
It's just like the movies,
it's like...
It's the same thing.

86
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,684
It's changed.
Jaycees haunted
house is in the '60s.

87
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,553
You walk around and guys
jumped out and said, "Boo."

88
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,121
That doesn't cut it anymore.

89
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,890
When you were little,
going through haunted houses

90
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,859
you didn't know if it
was real or not, right?

91
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,995
That element,
what that feels like,
I wanna find it again.

92
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,431
Be on time to the RV.

93
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,233
Everyone's looking at Mikey.

94
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,702
I was staring in
this direction.
Be on time.

95
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,270
All right. Cheers!

96
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,538
Happy Halloween!

97
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,440
First night to
the haunted house.

98
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:25,017
Put me down.

99
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,053
What are you guys up to?

100
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,955
We're going to
as many houses as we can
all across America.

101
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,463
Where
the hell did you get that?

102
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,664
Motherfucker!

103
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,037
Is there anything
that's even scared you?

104
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,507
I remember a haunt
I went to probably
three, four years ago.

105
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,810
There was a guy on the floor,
he was munching
his teeth at me.

106
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,380
And I looked at him
and he had
entrails behind him.

107
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,382
So he was a paraplegic
they hired.

108
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,951
He was real fast on his hands
and I thought
that was the most

109
00:06:58,952 --> 00:06:59,952
scariest thing I've ever seen.

110
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,621
So how do you find people?

111
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,490
A lot of people
are word of mouth

112
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,525
and a lot of people
have worked for us
for many years,

113
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,693
and they bring their friends

114
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,662
and then we also put
ads in the Greensheet

115
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,730
and the local newspapers.

116
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,399
And we try to
recruit that way too.

117
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,668
Do you do
like a background check
on people?

118
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,837
You know currently we
do not do a background check.

119
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,873
But we're looking into
doing that in future.

120
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,783
- Fuck, bro!
- Come on man.

121
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:05,951
What the fuck
are you doing here?

122
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,052
Why didn't you just call me?

123
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,120
What are you doing here?

124
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,222
I went out last night.
Had a good time.

125
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,024
Then I came here on time.

126
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,859
You've never been on time
for a fucking thing
in your life.

127
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,728
Now I'm on time
'cause I was
here hours before.

128
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,096
Just be quiet.

129
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,530
Why do I need to be quiet?

130
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,432
I need you serious,
from here on out.

131
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,834
Gonna be serious from...
In about a minute from now.

132
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,238
Why in a minute?

133
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,306
Say hi.

134
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:27,606
- Hi.
- Hi.

135
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,876
High-five?

136
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:36,949
Why is it upside down now?

137
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,483
Flip it.

138
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,452
We gotta get some
fucking food, man.

139
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,787
I want coffee.

140
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,188
- Morning.

141
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,256
Ladies.

142
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,424
What's up, son?

143
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,494
- Hi!
- Haunted houses.

144
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,762
How are you
already here?

145
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,730
You told the bartender,
the cab driver,

146
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,365
the guy behind the hotel...

147
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,867
We're all going on
a road trip. Who cares?

148
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,435
Yeah. Road trip.

149
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,338
And then, dude, and then
you got a fucking pumpkin

150
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,572
and tried to stick
your dick in it.

151
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,174
Yeah. You did
a little <i>American Pie,</i>

152
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,942
Halloween's style.

153
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,645
Zack, I want to be
there to help you out
on this situation but you did.

154
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,581
- I'm sorry, I have rolling...
- Zack's version...

155
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,450
But I doubt that I did that.

156
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:12,718
Yo pumpkin pie.

157
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,153
How're you feeling today?

158
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,122
Like angels and sunbeams
and unicorns.

159
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,624
- You look it.

160
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,192
Just check it out.
I got part of the fridge

161
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,927
that's just gonna be
Jeff's healthy stuff.

162
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:22,995
All right,
so you guys know.

163
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,097
You're an idiot.

164
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,266
I will eat of your healthy
stuff for the whole trip
in one night after drinking.

165
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,067
Why do you need
seven cameras?

166
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,969
Why? 'Cause I
wanna document it all.

167
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,206
You ready to go?
All right, let's go to it.
All right team on three. Boom!

168
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,008
- Jeff, Jeff.
- What?

169
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,444
You're never
ever gonna get laid
if you do things like that.

170
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,281
- You excited?

171
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,082
I'm excited.
These are always...

172
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,385
I never know what
I'm getting myself into

173
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,286
when we start off,

174
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,622
but I always have
a good time by the end of it.

175
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,491
So I'm definitely excited.

176
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,092
Zack said you
were a little nervous.

177
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,795
I know I tend to be jumpy

178
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,665
as a person, so...

179
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,700
Couple that with
the fact that I haven't

180
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:05,037
been to a haunted house
in probably...

181
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:08,073
I don't even
know how many years,
since I was eight or nine.

182
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,476
I kinda don't really
know how I'm gonna react

183
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,944
or what it's
gonna be like or...

184
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,912
I think haunts
have come a long way.

185
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,882
...since you were
eight or nine years old.

186
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,851
See, as long as you
give me that in the houses,
we're good.

187
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,654
Why don't you
tell us more about

188
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:27,092
your little kid experience
going through a haunted house.

189
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:27,559
Um... Well,
I assaulted a scare actor,

190
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,965
when I was a child.

191
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,501
Guy jumps down from a tree

192
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,569
and I'm so petrified,
I don't...

193
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,105
My bodily reaction is just
to punch him in the gut.

194
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,741
When the lights
are going like this
and you're so disoriented,

195
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,776
the guy actually it
seemed like he jumped

196
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,646
straight back up into the tree
almost like he had like a...

197
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,182
Seven foot vertical.

198
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,684
Probably 'cause I was
like 3'7" at the time.

199
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:56,455
I'm assuming
they've come a long way
since we were kids.

200
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,723
Well, I mean,
I should hope so.

201
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,892
'Cause I like the only
haunts I've ever been to

202
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,194
are the ones at theme parks
or something like that,

203
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,363
where the scariest thing is
somebody running up to you

204
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,199
while you're waiting in line
for a hotdog or something.

205
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,101
I promise you they're
not gonna be like that.

206
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,103
All right.

207
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,005
We're gonna be
out in the country,
there's gonna be no rules,

208
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,607
o regulations.
- Mmm-hmm.

209
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,476
I don't know how this
sounds like a good thing.

210
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,012
This is always
what you wish.

211
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,547
There's gonna be no rules,
no regulations.

212
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,015
You don't even know
where we're going.

213
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,817
I'm feeling kinda bad
for all these bugs
on the windshield.

214
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,319
You're a pacifist for bugs?

215
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,954
I felt bad 'cause there were

216
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,489
a few butterflies that
hit the windshield too.

217
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,057
I'd like to
know where we're...

218
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,792
Settle down.
I've got something
planned for everyone.

219
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,294
You have it all planned out.

220
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,762
You know exactly
where we're going?

221
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,864
I know exactly
where we're going.

222
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:39,064
Let's get directions.
No way he's guiding
this fucking ship.

223
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,467
It's not organic.

224
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,171
I'm still
making pancakes so...

225
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:46,605
This thing is sweet,
I don't know why.

226
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,808
Paddle.

227
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,779
Hey, man, do you know how
to get to the haunt house?

228
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,113
Are you all sure
you wanna go there?

229
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,515
Mikey,
stop screwing around.

230
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,383
- We can't find the exit.
- We're just lost.

231
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,953
Yeah? All right.
You go down the road
right here about five miles.

232
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,322
- It'll be in the forest
on the left hand side.
Mike, let's go.

233
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,823
- I want this.
- You're not buying that.

234
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:05,958
- Thank you so much.
- Let's go.

235
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,225
Hey, guys, we got...

236
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,228
- You know where it is?
- Yeah.

237
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,363
It's five miles
up the road.

238
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,665
Getting
antsy over there, Jeff?

239
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,401
No, I'm just, you know,
jumping to my own beat.
You know?

240
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,437
Just jump...
Jumpin' to my beat.

241
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,439
- You know,
I hope everyone...
- Jumping to his own beat.

242
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,974
I might just
rap for you later.

243
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,342
One celebratory
shot on the road.

244
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,012
That's what last night was.

245
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,714
Yeah, but now we're like

246
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,315
"on the road", on the road.

247
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,817
I'll drink if Jeff does.

248
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,585
Air shots?

249
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,389
Dude you look like
you're jerking off
an elephant.

250
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,161
Jeff,
I heard that you have a poem.

251
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:43,929
The... Oh, the poem.

252
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:46,698
I don't know
if he can read it.

253
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,799
I can't read it while I'm...

254
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,401
I can read the poem.

255
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,502
I wanna read it.
I haven't read it.

256
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,069
"I am poem."

257
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,238
I gotta listen to this.

258
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,141
"I am Job."

259
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,379
You hear that,
the first line.

260
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,849
"I'm a swell guy
who eats strawberries.

261
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,316
"I wonder if demons
even inhabited the earth.

262
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:08,120
"I hear angels crying in my

263
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,424
"brain?"

264
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,792
"In my barn."

265
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,027
- "Barn."
In my what?

266
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,061
"I touched the roughness...

267
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,698
"The roughness
of Bigfoot's arm."

268
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,604
No transition,
nothing.

269
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,204
Mikey, it's called art.

270
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,942
I'm so excited.

271
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,979
This is the first night.

272
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,820
These haunt owners
have forums, chat rooms.

273
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,255
They put up these pictures.

274
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,257
Dude, there's some crazy shit
that goes on there.

275
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,291
You're in,
you could park up there.

276
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,994
Are you the sheriff
of the town?

277
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,095
- Am I?
- Yeah.

278
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,229
No, I'm just security.

279
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,330
Oh, okay, okay.

280
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,532
I wish I was sheriff.

281
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,067
Awesome.

282
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,568
Hello!

283
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:58,403
- Cool.
- Haunt house.

284
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,106
Let's do it.

285
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,174
Let's get scared.

286
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:04,676
Let's get scared.

287
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,535
You didn't do that.

288
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,417
I will finally make you
get in a coffin, look.

289
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,191
Let me the fuck out of here!

290
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,367
You're such a dick.

291
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,268
You know I'm claustrophobic.

292
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,238
We can go in now?

293
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,741
You coming?

294
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Shit! Didn't even
get in the door yet.

295
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:31,530
Got you.

296
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,635
Mikey?
I can't see shit.

297
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,353
- Bobby?

298
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,022
What the fuck?

299
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:42,300
Where the hell are we?

300
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,837
Even the music is creepy.

301
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,109
So weird.

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the fuck?

303
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:02,988
Come play with me.

304
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:05,724
Follow her.

305
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Get the fuck down!
Fuck!
You wanna be
a pretty doll like me?

306
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,538
Oh, shit!
What was that?

307
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,807
Bobby, don't go over there.

308
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,243
- Ashes!
- What is going on?

309
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,178
Ashes!

310
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,748
We all fall down!

311
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,889
Get the fuck out of here!

312
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,692
Come back here.
I'm not done with you yet.

313
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:41,927
They just love to run you
out of those places
with chainsaws.

314
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,397
Bob, did you like it?

315
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,134
I don't give
a shit about this place.
I wanna talk to these people.

316
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,235
What's goin' on?
How are you?

317
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,336
Pretty good.

318
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,438
Uh, do you care if we
ask you some questions?

319
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:53,905
Sure.

320
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,042
So my friend here
thinks that, uh,

321
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,744
shady shit goes on
in these places.
What do you think?

322
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,414
I can probably say
I agree with that.

323
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,516
I would think it just
be fun to work here.

324
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,251
It is fun. It's interesting.

325
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,053
It's definitely different.

326
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,323
How so?

327
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,963
Bob, Bob, Bob,
let's go on the roof.

328
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,564
There's a ladder
right over there.

329
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:20,665
You will never
be able to get
on the roof.

330
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,233
We can film over like that.

331
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,401
There's a ladder
at the back.

332
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,338
Okay.

333
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,240
Mikey,
when you get up there,

334
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:29,507
- do the fucking
<i>Almost Famous</i>thing.
- What is that?

335
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,244
Stop being
so fucking paranoid.

336
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:35,447
--Oh, shit!

337
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,484
There's a shit ton
of people down there, man.

338
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,361
Happy Halloween, guys! Yay!

339
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:50,462
Whoo! Whoo!

340
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:54,199
They're not
fucking happy, Mike.

341
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,669
Go.
Get out of here. Go, go.

342
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,541
- Mikey?
- What?

343
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,043
Be quiet...

344
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,277
Mikey, let's go. Now!

345
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,247
Take your hoodie off, son.

346
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,815
Take your hoodie off.

347
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,517
- Where ya goin', boy?

348
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,456
Well it's
the first night and you've

349
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,392
already pissed off
all the haunt workers.

350
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:21,626
So good one, guys.

351
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,028
What's the scariest part?

352
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:26,164
I mean creepy guy one,
creepy girl two...

353
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,566
I like the bush,
like the...

354
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,068
There was this weird part,

355
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,503
where we had to wait
because people would be...

356
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,771
Mike,
are you sleeping already?

357
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,205
Before you went
through the back...

358
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,540
The guy was in camo,
and he jumped
out of the rose bush...

359
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,710
I need you to
show me the side...

360
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,445
Mike,
that's that clown.

361
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,213
Bobby, what are you
talking about?

362
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,384
Dude tried
to break my camera.

363
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,485
He seems really pissed.

364
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,326
Can we just go?
This guy is weirding me out.

365
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,995
Am I good on that side?
Can I?

366
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,630
- Get the fuck
outta here.

367
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,739
Did you all here that?

368
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,825
Shit!

369
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,393
What the fuck?

370
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,167
Hello?

371
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,754
- Shit!

372
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jesus!
- Jesus!

373
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,264
You fucking kidding me?

374
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,933
You asshole.

375
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,535
- You literally
shit in your pants.
Come on, man.

376
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:46,137
Oh, my God! I wish the camera
could have seen you face.

377
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:46,371
- I'm too overweight for this.
- I'm gonna have a heart attack.

378
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,475
How far will you go
 to scare people?

379
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:53,945
Uh...

380
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,415
Perhaps to the point of...

381
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,117
They won't let us
touch 'em or bash 'em over

382
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:00,752
the head and drag
'em off anywhere,

383
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,754
so I have to kinda
stop at that point.

384
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:03,288
I heard of, uh,

385
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,224
a  in New Orleans
doing a lot of weird
crazy stuff but,

386
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,430
I have never been to
one that really does that.

387
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:16,201
Thank goodness!
That's invading my
territorial bubble.

388
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,236
I tend to freak out if
you try to tie me up.

389
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:21,506
I grew up with three sisters.
They always tied me up
and did things to me

390
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,741
and I don't...
Yeah, I don't... Yeah.

391
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,009
No, I wouldn't go for that.

392
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,917
No, not completely naked...

393
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:33,851
I have, like, you know,

394
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,921
a little bathing suit on
and whatever,

395
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,357
and the whole rest
of my body was blue.

396
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:39,691
I had weird ears and a tail
and everything like that.

397
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,294
Most Zack's ever done is

398
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:46,164
done a white
sheet over his head
and two black holes.

399
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,936
Wasn't he like
a muscle man one year?

400
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,004
I highly doubt it.

401
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:53,705
I was the Shake Weight.

402
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:58,042
That's what he was,
he was a Shake Weight.

403
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,544
The Shake Weight guy.

404
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,745
Don't ever do that again.

405
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,513
So gross.

406
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,783
Okay.

407
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,686
Okay, I'm just
reading this tweet, okay.

408
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,656
"They say penis size
is related to shoe size,

409
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:12,390
"which makes
the fear of being raped
by a clown that much scarier."

410
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:18,730
Give me some of those.

411
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,366
I will trade you...

412
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,470
...my chocolate

413
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:25,903
- for one of these.
Bro,
look at your eyes.

414
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,607
I can't help it.
I gotta take a piss.

415
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,045
But there's a fucking
lineup for the bathroom.

416
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:34,178
Now I'm residual high.

417
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:37,649
From your cigarettes.

418
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,253
- I like that trade.

419
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:49,327
Right. When do you
think you're gonna
tell us where we're going?

420
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,300
It's gonna be a shit show

421
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,367
when we go on
this haunt tonight.

422
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,568
It's all his fault.

423
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,304
I didn't know you
couldn't handle smoking weed.

424
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,577
Oh, my God!

425
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,278
Oh, my God!

426
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,816
Oh, my God!
He is still crying.

427
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,451
You really
think it's a good idea

428
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,986
for you walk through
any of these haunts?

429
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,154
I've got a few hours.

430
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:17,922
Yeah, fucked up?

431
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,891
You're gonna be a train wreck.

432
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,259
It's his fault.

433
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,527
I don't care
whose fault it is,

434
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,895
we've got to be
there in two hours.

435
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,197
This place is very creepy.

436
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,365
I'm scared, you're scared,
we're all scared.

437
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,835
And then we can get...

438
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,640
You sound like,
"You scream, I scream,
we all scream for ice cream."

439
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,874
You have any?

440
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,712
Brandy,
what are you most afraid of?

441
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,615
- I have a fear of snakes.
- Me too.

442
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:47,018
I guarantee you
snakes are...

443
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,253
I hate 'em.
They don't move right.

444
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:52,223
They're just unnatural.
I'm not a fan at all.

445
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,292
I met a chick once and when
we came back to her place,

446
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,427
and she had a fucking python,
like, as a pet.

447
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,729
And she just pulled it out.

448
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,497
She'd come home drunk
and pulled it...
I'm like, "Ahh!

449
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,932
"This is never gonna work."

450
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,767
I'm gonna put you
in a coffin and then

451
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:04,535
put snakes in the coffin,
would you do it?

452
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,504
No, absolutely not.
I will not...

453
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,873
How much would
we have to pay you?

454
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,476
For $1,000 would you
get in the coffin?

455
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:13,277
For $5,000 I would.

456
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,413
Coffin,
cut a hole at the bottom
and send snakes through it.

457
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:18,683
Are they poisonous?
Can you guarantee
they're not poisonous?

458
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:18,850
Yes, they're poisonous.

459
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,520
These are
big boy seats.

460
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,523
Bobby what was that thing

461
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:27,525
you were just saying about me
just a couple of minutes ago?

462
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:30,862
I don't recall.

463
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,865
Well, I'll just lead you in
and remind you...

464
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,567
- We're lucky to have you
- ...and refresh your memory.

465
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,102
We're lucky to have you.

466
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,638
Yeah,
say that one more time.
Hold on.

467
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,140
- Brandy, we're...
- Hold on.

468
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,008
And... Go!

469
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,743
Brandy, we're lucky
to have you here.

470
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,412
Yeah, that's right.

471
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,180
How do you feel
about that, Mike?

472
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:49,781
About what?

473
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,851
I wouldn't call you
a sister I never had.

474
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,853
Just in case we
ever get naked.

475
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,221
Already had her.

476
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,856
- Already had her.
- Never gonna happen.

477
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,926
We made out on a roof top,
kind of one time
when we were 16.

478
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,060
There was
actually no making out.

479
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,262
We didn't make out,

480
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:06,197
it was just like heavy
petting. It was weird.

481
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:07,965
Zack, is there
like a trailer for this haunt?

482
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:12,503
Like, did they
make a commercial?

483
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:12,937
Yeah I was
trying to show Brandy
but she just freaked out.

484
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,074
Why don't any
of these haunts
make commercials?

485
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,212
I don't see commercials do ya?

486
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,782
Asshole!

487
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,617
Are you
fucking kidding me?

488
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:26,918
We're gonna be in the...
Driving the scares in
the zombie paint ball.

489
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:31,556
Jeff, did you hear that?

490
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:32,723
It's gonna be awesome.

491
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,091
Can't wait.

492
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,461
Now, do the zombies have guns?

493
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:38,296
Are we out in
the forest paint balling?

494
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:39,597
I don't know...

495
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,332
Have you ever seen
a zombie shoot a gun?

496
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,033
No, I've never seen...

497
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,969
Has it ever happened
in cinema history?

498
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,903
No, but... I don't know.

499
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,040
Are they gonna
shoot back at us though?

500
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,676
All head shots,
right, Jeff?

501
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:52,877
Zombie 101.

502
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,212
Hey, we have time.

503
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,014
You guys wanna pull over
and have drinks first?

504
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,489
All alone now.

505
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,093
Nature.

506
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,062
Somebody was
here before us.

507
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,499
Yeah.

508
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,602
Yeah, they said it was
okay to camp over here.

509
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:19,003
I mean,
it just went out.

510
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,371
- Got any wood?
- Not a big camper...

511
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,672
Were you a Brownie?

512
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,841
- Yep.
- I ate a brownie once.

513
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:26,110
Really?

514
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,645
How do you know...
That's a beautiful fire.

515
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,946
Have you ever
camped in your life?

516
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,315
Nope,
not when I stay at Motel 6.

517
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,654
Hey, more beer.

518
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,723
That's not
why I'm on this trip.

519
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:39,891
We don't have marshmallows?

520
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,425
No.

521
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,960
No, it's for you.

522
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,061
Drink it, drink it.
Drink it, Bran.

523
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:47,765
Don't waste it.

524
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:48,499
Yuck!

525
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,570
It was just the foam,
that's so gross.

526
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:54,405
So this is a rap
I wrote this morning.

527
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,474
"Livin' in a barn
is the life for me.

528
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,342
"Green hill farm
is the place to be.

529
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,444
"If you pee on a fence
and you hate your wiener,

530
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,813
"don't be looking at my turkey
'cause he ain't for dinner.

531
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,348
"4:00 a.m.
and the cows get up.

532
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,417
"No desert till you
crush that sauerkraut.

533
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,518
"Got a barn full of hay,

534
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,653
"A fire with some s'mores,

535
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:10,454
"Mom yelling
'Chickens, chores!'

536
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,390
"Ain't no arcade till
that shit gets shoveled.

537
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:14,592
"What you lookin' at, fool?
This is life in a bubble."

538
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,363
That's from
Ohio right there.
- Yeah.

539
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,765
- We know.
- Straight up.

540
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:21,832
Shampoo conditioner.

541
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:22,733
Beard repair.

542
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,435
Uh...

543
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:27,972
What's that goes underneath
my skin? Beard oil.

544
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,473
What's beard repair?

545
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,342
Repairs you do like
once every three days.

546
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,110
- Those are all flammable.
- You know that, right?

547
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,612
- Hello.
- Huh? Fuck!

548
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:35,980
- You all enjoying my fire?
- Jesus.

549
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,248
Holy shit, man.

550
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:45,856
So, what the hell you
doin' out in the woods?

551
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,758
I live out there.

552
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,594
- Which haunt do you work at?
- The one down the road?

553
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:51,062
Yeah.

554
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:51,996
Yeah, we're
goin' there next, I think.

555
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,531
Yeah.

556
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,099
We see a bunch of kids
at a lot of these haunts,

557
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,068
'cause no one's calling
Social Services on 'em.

558
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,437
They're like eight,
nine years old.

559
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:02,340
You know, it's like here
in backwoods and shit,

560
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,407
there's no rules,
there's none of that stuff.

561
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,944
What you mean "backwoods"?

562
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:30,468
If that dude
is still at our campfire
when we go back, I'm out.

563
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,903
I hope they shoot you
with a paint ball.

564
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:36,240
Hey, this place is
putting my Presidential
stimulus plan in action.

565
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,108
Do you want the camera?
Can you come over here now?

566
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,511
Hey, do you...

567
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,414
Can we film in here?

568
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:44,115
All right, awesome.

569
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,017
I prefer to call it
a zombie stimulus plan.

570
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,823
--Brandy thinks it's a laser.

571
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,892
- I'm really excited.
- That's ridiculous.

572
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,328
How long have
you guys been doin'
the zombie paintball?

573
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,729
This is our first year.

574
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,298
- First year?
- Groundbreaking!

575
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,333
Wow!

576
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:03,801
Well, I'm gonna
tell everybody I know,
just so you know.

577
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,936
Seven more people
are going to find out.

578
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,471
He has
seven Facebook friends.

579
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,345
I don't think
I hit anything.
Get closer.

580
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,480
So, how can you do that?
How can you do that?

581
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,787
Put these on.

582
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,323
All right, guys,
getting into dead
territory over here.

583
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,894
Oh, fuck,
look at that face.

584
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,629
Man,
I'm gonna crush this guy.
There he is.

585
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:34,565
- Get that one.

586
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,209
Get it, get it, get it.

587
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,979
Oh, shit!

588
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,214
Yeah, you bitches!
Fucking die!

589
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:52,917
Hey, Mikey,
did that hit you?

590
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:55,086
Yeah. Right in the face, dude.

591
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,957
Power of Christ
compels you!

592
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,325
That was awesome.

593
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:07,531
That was the most fun
I've had in forever,
that was so cool.

594
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,367
Zack, I will do
whatever you wanna do.

595
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,701
Thank you.

596
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,304
Hey! I want that written
down and documented.

597
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,506
Jeff said,
"I will do whatever
you want on this trip."

598
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,808
Whatever, this is
like the most fun ever.

599
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,643
What did you think, mate?

600
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:20,244
Banging around.

601
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,980
- I'll fix it.
- RV is breaking down.

602
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,449
I'm going to be banging
around back there soon

603
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,550
with a zombie.

604
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,052
Bang around and go
to fucking bed.

605
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,954
That joke is
never going to die.

606
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:31,355
I think let's pull over.

607
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,590
Keep going.

608
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:33,924
What the fuck is that?

609
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:34,825
Hey, guys.

610
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,129
Is that the girl
from the haunt?

611
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,630
We're 100 miles from there,
there's no way that's her.

612
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:40,998
Stop.
Pull over in front of her.

613
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,700
- Oh, my God.
- Why?

614
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:43,834
What,
are you going to talk
to her or something?

615
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,770
Stop. Pull over.
Just pull up.

616
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,338
- I'll go talk to her.
Trying to
be the hero?

617
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,672
Well,
I'm not trying to be a...

618
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:49,507
Real, genuine, Texan.

619
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:53,844
Why does your brother do this?

620
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,579
Also 3:00 in the morning.

621
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:02,753
Oh!
There goes your brother.

622
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,522
She didn't
really say anything.

623
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:13,964
Mikey, what's going on?

624
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:14,698
I don't know.

625
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,668
She just kind of
followed me in here.

626
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,373
Something
happened to your car?

627
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:27,778
Can you call somebody
or something?

628
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,649
Is there
anywhere we can take you?

629
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,547
What the fuck was that?

630
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,518
Getting the fuck out of here.

631
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:10,321
She was just
fucking with us. Let's go.

632
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,328
It was okay,
but it was too scary for me.

633
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,395
- It was good.
- Yeah?

634
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,597
It was a good
little scare.

635
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,165
The scariest thing is
when the walls open up

636
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,766
and they come
out from the walls.

637
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,835
You don't even see 'em
'cause they look
like the walls.

638
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,504
There's all blood
gushing everywhere.

639
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,006
I was like,
"Oh, my gosh".

640
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,941
It was like, "Get me
out of this damn place".

641
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,843
Because I was scared
he had a chainsaw!

642
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,411
That's what
I'm looking for.

643
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,579
This lady, uh-uh.

644
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:35,746
She wants the,
"Ooh, all scary.
Oh, my God." No.

645
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:42,286
We want the real stuff,
the <i>Faces of Death</i> stuff.

646
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:45,089
Your community service was
working at a haunted house?

647
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,891
For real, for real.

648
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:49,527
Okay, see, now that,
had I known that first,

649
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,729
- that'd make it
scarier going in.
- Yeah.

650
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,133
Let's do it.

651
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,334
Is everybody else up?

652
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,136
Uh, I don't know.

653
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,638
Mikey's definitely not.

654
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,473
I think I nudged him,
like, five times.

655
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:04,708
Does it have to be
like this every morning?

656
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,011
I need eight minutes
to totally get ready.

657
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,412
I'll be fine.
You get ready.

658
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,781
The last night
was really weird.

659
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,150
- Yeah, you made it weird.
- You brought her in here.

660
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:16,887
Oh, man, I didn't think
that was going to happen,
it was just...

661
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,491
It's kind of weird.
It's almost like
they're fictional characters.

662
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,326
- You know what I mean?
- Yep.

663
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:23,627
So funny.

664
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,229
I mean,
I guess not really funny.

665
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,137
Bob, what exactly are
you looking for on this?

666
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:36,006
I mean these...
You keep saying back country.

667
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,508
I mean, that's...

668
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:38,776
Where these hillbillies...

669
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,744
Some of them are
a little messed up.

670
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,546
These places though,
it's like,

671
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,282
we have this password
we have to find for this.

672
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,451
They say "blue skull,
blue skeleton."

673
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:50,588
But there's something to blue
because people keep using it.

674
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,023
And it was in Dallas,
then it was in Houston.

675
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,224
And so it moves around.

676
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,960
So it's not as
much about backwoods

677
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:58,762
as we're going to have to
go to the backwoods
to find the password.

678
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,497
But the place,
it seems like...

679
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:01,765
"Is this the haunt hole?"

680
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,534
What is an extreme haunt?

681
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:06,236
Instead of them
chasing you with a chainsaw
with no chain on it,

682
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:09,173
they're going to chase you
with the chain on it
and like...

683
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:11,175
I don't understand how far...

684
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:14,378
Like, how far you really
can go on without
hurting somebody.

685
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,253
- But that's where...
- Oh, shit.

686
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,822
You need to get out,
and we need to check with...

687
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:26,023
Guys,
where in the hell
is this place?

688
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,994
I want to say it's
further away than you think,

689
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:36,367
but, Todd says, "Are we lost?"

690
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,308
Look at this place.

691
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,043
Can I even fit,
Zack, is this...

692
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:47,711
Can you
even get in here?

693
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,780
Going to
have to make it work.

694
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:52,116
Oh, my God.

695
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:53,751
Can you try not to run over
any more children?

696
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:55,152
All these people
are already outside.

697
00:35:57,122 --> 00:35:58,822
It's actually kind of cool
to get here early and see

698
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,691
like, they're,
like, being real people.

699
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,393
Oh!

700
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,503
This place
is a shit hole, Bobby.

701
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,004
In the middle
of bumfuck nowhere.

702
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,673
His back was enough
for you, Bobby?

703
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,408
These are your people,
farm boy.

704
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:19,643
That's right, dude.
- It looks like high
school kids made this.

705
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,578
- What up?
- What?

706
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,880
- I couldn't even go.
Let's go.
We're going to...

707
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:23,614
What so you mean...
Let's go.

708
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,816
The line was ridiculous.

709
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,184
Why are you waiting in line?
We're in the middle
of a fucking forest.

710
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:27,718
Go piss in the bushes.

711
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,301
Holy shit.

712
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:46,403
Dude.

713
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:48,272
Nice costume.

714
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:51,842
Jesus!

715
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:57,081
Okay.

716
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:00,751
Holy shit.

717
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,086
What the hell, man?

718
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:03,954
Leave me alone.

719
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,355
Don't!

720
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,057
Why the fuck are
you following me?

721
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,592
Oh, fuck.

722
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:09,960
Get the fuck away.

723
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,163
Oh, fuck!

724
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,502
Please, what do you want?

725
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,171
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

726
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:23,574
What the fuck?

727
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,947
Jesus. Not even a haunt yet.

728
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:33,217
Zack?

729
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,152
Yo.

730
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,860
What are you doing, man?

731
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,068
Hey, guys! How's it going?
What's your name, buddy?

732
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,273
Hi, Mikey.
How are you doin'?

733
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,042
What's the camera for?
Are you guys
doing <i>Crimestoppers</i>

734
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,377
or <i>Cops</i> or something?

735
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,945
We're doing
<i>To Catch a Predator.</i>

736
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,547
<i>To Catch a Predator?</i>

737
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:06,416
I gotta go.

738
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,354
Watch out,
where're you going,
you piece of shit?

739
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:11,054
Ooh.
 Oh, I like big, fuzzy bears.

740
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:15,425
Ooh.

741
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,161
Oh!
Always touch the beard.

742
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:18,562
Always touch the beard.

743
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:19,830
I feel
so violated right now.

744
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,507
Zack, watch the light.

745
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:33,310
Trying, dude.
Go ahead of us.

746
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:46,023
Break out! Break out!

747
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,759
Come on!

748
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,462
Zack?

749
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:53,797
Where did you go?

750
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,800
Wait, where are you?

751
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:05,309
Which way?

752
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,425
That's disgusting.

753
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:22,559
Brandy, you all right?

754
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,099
Please!

755
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,468
No, no! Let me go, please.

756
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,574
Let me out.
Let me out.

757
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:38,909
Let me out!

758
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,779
Please, let me go!

759
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,781
Ed, shut the fuck up!

760
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:45,616
This is so fucked up.

761
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,720
You want
a piece of her, boys?

762
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Zack, I don't think
we're supposed to go in here.
Zack! Don't go...
Don't go.

763
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:00,898
I'm just
here for your father.

764
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,367
Get that thing out of here!

765
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,243
Get out of here!

766
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,611
Guys,
let's get out of here!

767
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,346
Get the fuck out of here!

768
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,412
He's still behind you!

769
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,347
Walk, walk, walk.
He's still following us.

770
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,084
Zack!

771
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,653
Oh, my God!

772
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,593
Oh, my God!

773
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,661
Oh, God!

774
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,167
What's going on?

775
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:11,702
Oh, shit!

776
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,504
Back up,
back up, back up, back up!

777
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,980
Shit.

778
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,118
Zack, let's go.
Let's go.

779
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:37,260
Zack, let's go!
Let's go! Fuck! Come on!

780
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,963
There you are,
fucking sucker!
Yeah, take it!

781
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,131
Take it! Take it!

782
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:42,466
<i>Good morning.</i>

783
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,169
Brandy.

784
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,704
You're gonna die.

785
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,608
- Brandy.
- Walk away.

786
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:25,375
Brandy.

787
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:28,779
It's time to play!

788
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:31,815
Get the fuck away from me!

789
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,016
Oh, shit!

790
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,651
Die! You're gonna die!

791
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:40,290
I think it's a little weird
that they knew my name.

792
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,260
Someone probably told them
to say that to freak you out.

793
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:54,805
Wait, what?

794
00:42:54,806 --> 00:42:56,807
- Why didn't you say anything?

795
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:59,342
Honestly, because
you guys get so scared
about everything.

796
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,078
I wanted to make sure
you could go
through the haunt.

797
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,145
Zack's the one...

798
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,246
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

799
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,614
Ask them.

800
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:05,515
Zack,
where we going tomorrow?

801
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,352
Have you told him?

802
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:11,354
It was a haunted house
 down in the south somewhere.

803
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:15,559
I don't know if
it was in Alabama
or wherever it was on.

804
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,096
We have a forum, chat room,
for haunted house owners.

805
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,665
And, uh, there was a, um...

806
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,568
A younger kid
that was in a scene,
where it was a hanging scene,

807
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:26,903
and he had replaced
the breakaway noose

808
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,172
that was in
the scene with his own,

809
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,675
but he accidentally
hung himself.

810
00:43:31,676 --> 00:43:33,543
<i>Um, and it was
 part of the show.</i>

811
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:36,513
And by the time
they were able to
take care of the situation...

812
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:37,948
I mean, he was already dead.

813
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,850
This was,
like, in a haunted house?

814
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,685
This was in
a haunted house while
the haunted house was open.

815
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:53,730
...or should I get Skittles?

816
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,365
This is all garbage food,
all garbage food.

817
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:56,967
Or should I get
Sour Patch Kids?

818
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:58,802
Yeah,
I don't think any of your...

819
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,171
Or should I get a big pickle?

820
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:02,372
So, are we off the 20?

821
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,740
What is a good name

822
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:04,708
- for a city?
- Where's the haunt?

823
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:05,675
What city is the haunt in?

824
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:06,977
That is not what I know.

825
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,578
Not our job.
Not our job.

826
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,180
Look how creepy...

827
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:11,548
Look how creepy this is.

828
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:13,083
- I love this.
- What the hell is that?

829
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:14,518
And he's combing his hair?

830
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:17,487
We're going
to find these places that...

831
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,789
I don't know
what goes on if they

832
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,025
use real body parts
or whatever.

833
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,628
Real body parts,
that doesn't scare me,
though, like...

834
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:26,229
I'm not going to
know the difference.

835
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,864
If a real human leg...

836
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:30,500
But I won't know
if it's a real human leg

837
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,102
or it's a fake human leg,
so it's not...

838
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:33,136
That doesn't bother me because
I don't know the truth anyway.

839
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,940
What someone's idea
of what scary is,

840
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,011
is totally different
to somebody else.

841
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:44,014
Is it dressing up the walls,
with blood dripping off
and all that stuff?

842
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,382
I don't need all that.

843
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:48,552
Mine's more like,
real shit, dark.

844
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:50,587
I don't know where I'm going,
I don't know what's happening.

845
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:52,422
The intricate details to me
isn't that big of a deal.

846
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,890
Where are you going?

847
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:54,524
Why do you care?

848
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:57,928
Who you talking to?

849
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,430
Chantelle.

850
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,865
Yeah,
I got something good for him.

851
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:04,768
All right. All right.

852
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,939
This is Mikey's surprise,
give him a clue.

853
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,340
I did.
You gotta think about it.

854
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:12,709
I mean, think about
the theme of this trip.

855
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,710
Think about some
place Mikey loves
and just combine the two.

856
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:17,581
Dude, it's like some
Halloween theme thing.

857
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,319
Mikey,
are you into weird stuff?

858
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,421
Absolutely,
but I don't know if they're
gonna let us go in there.

859
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:26,823
Oh, hold on.
Look what he's...

860
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,358
Yes.
How old is that lady?

861
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,994
50-year veteran stripper.

862
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:43,707
Jeffrey,
is this your first time?

863
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,408
No...
Yeah, my first year
out of Florida.

864
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,576
Look at all that.

865
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,912
Insert them in, or... Okay.

866
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,982
All my research pays off
on haunted houses
and strip clubs.

867
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:53,650
All right,
let's have some fun.
Love it.

868
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:54,784
Brandy, you ready?

869
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,854
I mean, get crazy,
like, let's get nutty.

870
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,690
Yeah!

871
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,226
Getting some!

872
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:07,297
Come on, honey...

873
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:08,365
This is kind of hot.

874
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,801
Very exotic.

875
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:15,372
Zombie strippers?
Are you fucking kidding me?

876
00:46:23,481 --> 00:46:23,647
All right!

877
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,916
Whoo-hoo!

878
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,427
Fuck Christmas,
this is Halloween!

879
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:40,096
And then
Jeff with four girls, dude.

880
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:42,766
I mean, Jesus,
he almost swallowed a tit.

881
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:44,301
I thought it was
going to kill him.

882
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,769
I think she really liked me.

883
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:50,006
- Look at your jeans, man.
- A little extra starch.

884
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,343
You guys are
fucking disgusting.

885
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,090
Come out!

886
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,464
Be a part of this.
Come on.

887
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:15,732
Ahhh!

888
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,033
Are you coming or not?

889
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,839
Can we just roll through,

890
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,674
just taking
a couple snap pictures?

891
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,209
No.
No, you can't do that.

892
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,611
You can't have any cameras,
no pictures. I'm sorry.

893
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,613
This one's free.

894
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:32,482
Dude, you can't do
that shit in San Antonio.

895
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:34,851
Tell him about that
thing in Louisiana.

896
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,786
Hey, I heard about
something in Louisiana.

897
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:37,220
So, outside of it,
like, would you guys go out
after you get off work?

898
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:41,791
Um, some of us do.

899
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:42,859
I'm just... I'm bored...

900
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,761
Doin' this.

901
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:46,930
Dude, it was crazy, dude.

902
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,164
What?

903
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,566
What, did you guys
pay money to do it?

904
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:52,302
Yeah, it's like a tour,
like San Antonio...
It's like...

905
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:53,903
Have you ever
made out with guys,

906
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:55,438
like, in the haunt,
all dressed up?

907
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,140
o.
- Never?

908
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:58,908
- No, I have never made out with anybody at the haunt.
-  No.

909
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,610
- You never...
- It's like kissing
my brothers.

910
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:02,212
Um...

911
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,947
Is it...
Is it...

912
00:48:03,948 --> 00:48:06,015
Is it something
skeleton or skull,
we heard?

913
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,217
- Yeah.
- That's what it's called?

914
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,284
Yeah, something
like blue skeleton.

915
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,653
Have you ever hooked up
with make-up on?

916
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,822
Uh, no. No, actually, never.

917
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,124
- Seems hot.
- No, because, they're...

918
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,625
You guys have to
tell me about this.

919
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,494
Okay. See, I'm with
all this group of people,

920
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:19,329
and they're, like,
getting pissed with me

921
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:20,697
'cause I keep taking
them places like this.

922
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:22,165
We're trying to
find something extreme.

923
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,666
--Show me.

924
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,168
- Show you?
- Yeah, let me see it.

925
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:26,569
Okay.

926
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,204
I want to see you
contort your body.

927
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,073
Well, I would have
to take this off.

928
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,142
I'm not worried
about that.

929
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:33,109
Oh, shit, that's hot.

930
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,545
You got a hot thong on.

931
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,815
- Well, yeah.
- What do you...

932
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:40,083
Turn around.
What are your tattoos?

933
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,786
It's a lot harder.
I have a, um...

934
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:44,454
You guys are
my best friends.

935
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:45,655
Yeah, brother.
Good luck.

936
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:46,823
All right.
Thank you, guys.

937
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:47,991
Awesome.

938
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:49,125
Can I touch your face?

939
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,293
Sure.

940
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:53,329
That's awesome.

941
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,617
Sweet.

942
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,152
Haunted words.

943
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:28,465
- Hey, I found it.
- What?

944
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:29,866
- I found the Blue Skeleton.
- Yeah, dude...

945
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:31,167
Where?

946
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,802
Uh, this place that they said.
San Antonio.

947
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,404
And then his
other friend goes,
"Fuck San Antonio!"

948
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:36,272
He goes, "Tell him about that
crazy place we went to."

949
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,308
And I was, like,
"Hey, was it
called Skull Skeleton?"

950
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,176
He goes, "Blue Skeleton."

951
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,846
And they went last year.
And he said it's in
Louisiana this year.

952
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:44,914
Hey, we got it. We got it.

953
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,950
We're done.
We're going to Blue Skeleton.

954
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:48,485
We can go through
with two different cameras...

955
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,019
No, but we
gotta get to the end...

956
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,488
We got more places to go to.

957
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,722
Look, I don't know exactly...

958
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:54,557
Where ya'll going?
What are ya'll doing?

959
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:56,192
Yeah, I'm talkin'
to you, Biggin'.

960
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:57,827
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

961
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,696
What are you doing?

962
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:00,763
I knew you were
filming in there.
Give me the tape.

963
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:01,965
I didn't...

964
00:50:01,966 --> 00:50:03,666
Dude, I went through
one time with no camera.

965
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,101
Dude? Do I look like a dude?
I look like a clown, son!

966
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:07,303
Now, what were you
doing in there?

967
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,038
- We were just hanging.
- Yeah, we were just...

968
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,974
- We went through
your haunt.
- Just hanging? Just hanging?

969
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:12,208
Just hanging?

970
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:13,510
Just hanging with
the big shitty talk?

971
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,111
Whatever!
Where are the tapes?

972
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:16,246
I know you were recording.

973
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:17,580
We didn't
record anything.

974
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:18,915
You told us to put
the camera off...

975
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:21,584
I know you
were recording.

976
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:22,785
Dude, we didn't record.

977
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:24,187
Do you remember
yesterday?

978
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,889
I wasn't born then!

979
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:27,724
And fuckin' back up
and stop. Relax.

980
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:29,526
You want me to
fuck and back up?

981
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,861
- That is illegal
in this state.
- Fuck you. Just...

982
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,796
- Hey, dude, stop! Relax.
- You gotta get used
to some sodomy...

983
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,365
Prepare for some sodomy

984
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,866
because I'm
about to fuck you up!

985
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,167
Hey, dude,
you don't want...

986
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:39,402
You do not want to
get him pissed off.

987
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:40,570
I wanna get
him pissed off,

988
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:42,739
- you pissed off,
and fuck her.
- No, you don't.

989
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,973
You look ridiculous.

990
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:45,341
- You need to...
- Back the fuck up,
get out of here.

991
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,176
- Brandy, go inside, now!
- Okay.

992
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:49,379
- Back up.
- You heard me.
I've said my piece.

993
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,980
Get on before I hurt you.

994
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,417
No,
that's the second time

995
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:55,952
one of these guys
have got in my face.

996
00:50:55,953 --> 00:50:58,021
I swear to God, dude,
I'm gonna knock one of
these guys the fuck out!

997
00:50:58,022 --> 00:51:00,056
Maybe you shouldn't
make a sex tape
with his sister.

998
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:00,223
Oh, come on, man,
he didn't know that
I was filming her.

999
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:03,493
Beer wench.

1000
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,639
We should do
a different handshake
that's like...

1001
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,507
- Oh...
- Brandy, can you make...

1002
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,379
No.

1003
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:23,880
Oh...

1004
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,350
No, I don't like that.

1005
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:30,320
That wouldn't
catch on?
No.

1006
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:31,487
Oh...

1007
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:33,423
Oh,
where are those tongs?

1008
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1009
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,978
How far would they go
to scare somebody? You know...

1010
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:37,947
They will go pretty far.

1011
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:40,650
They will go pretty far
to breaking their leg,
breaking their back,

1012
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:42,852
<i>doing anything
they possibly can
to get a scare.</i>

1013
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:45,021
Do you think that
you have a stopping point?

1014
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:47,790
Uh...

1015
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:50,159
A stopping point...

1016
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,562
I have been asked,
and I have done

1017
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,864
many different
things over the years.

1018
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:57,433
We've heard rumors
you were using dead bodies.

1019
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:59,836
I'm not surprised,
to be honest.

1020
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:00,169
I'm not surprised.
That's actually scary.

1021
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,573
Real dead bodies?

1022
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:06,743
Hmm.

1023
00:54:07,845 --> 00:54:09,545
Not far, from what I've heard.

1024
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,547
Zacharias,
you hear anything last night?

1025
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:17,019
No. Come back here
for a sec, though.

1026
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,555
What are you doing?
Close up for a J.O. session?

1027
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:21,691
Yeah. Close the door.

1028
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:22,892
What do you mean,
"Close the door"? Why?

1029
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:24,093
Just close the door.

1030
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,862
This was posted
in a haunt chat
room last night.

1031
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:27,296
Dude, what?

1032
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:29,732
I've watched this
thing three times.

1033
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,834
Every single one of us
is in this video.

1034
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,536
How would you
have filmed this?

1035
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:34,003
Look.

1036
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,974
That's me.
Were you filming me
while I was asleep?

1037
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:40,910
I'm trying to figure
out how you filmed it,
unless Michael did it.

1038
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:43,146
But I just...
Michael's right before you.

1039
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:45,248
I'm in bed with Brandy,
there's Jeff...

1040
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:47,049
I can't explain this.

1041
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,818
And how's it online?

1042
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:50,853
This isn't...
What are you...

1043
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:53,022
The only thing I
can think of is,
this is just a part of it,

1044
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:54,991
- so we're just
gonna have to...
- Part of it?

1045
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:56,559
This is not a haunt.

1046
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,494
Dude, we're not in a haunt,
we're in the middle
of nowhere in our RV.

1047
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,663
- Yeah, I know.
- These guys came in here.

1048
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,832
Do not say a fucking word
or they will all go home.

1049
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,734
You guys seen
my license around?

1050
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:05,701
What are you wearing, dude?

1051
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:09,739
Real men wear pink.

1052
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,541
Those look like
Brandy's panties.

1053
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:12,775
You've never
seen my panties.

1054
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,110
Brandy's granny panties.

1055
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:15,545
- I blacked out last night.
- It could have been her.

1056
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:17,013
What do you mean,
"blacked out"?

1057
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:18,414
What the fuck!

1058
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:20,716
What the fuck is...

1059
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,218
What are
you doing, dude?

1060
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:23,953
What's going on, Michael?

1061
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:25,488
What the fuck are you doing?

1062
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:26,956
- What the fuck is that?
- Should I pull over?

1063
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:28,391
What do you mean,
"What is that?"

1064
00:55:28,392 --> 00:55:29,225
What the fuck?

1065
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,261
- What is it?

1066
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:33,596
What the fuck is that?

1067
00:55:33,597 --> 00:55:34,931
Is that a heart?

1068
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,166
- God, Michael!
- Jesus!

1069
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,802
Jesus Christ,
are you okay?

1070
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,537
- Is this you?
- Michael...

1071
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,339
Why the fuck is
he puking in here?

1072
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,907
Zack, You did that?

1073
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:46,075
Zack?

1074
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,176
Jesus Christ!

1075
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,811
What is that?

1076
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:51,614
I have no fucking idea.

1077
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:53,182
Don't touch it.
Don't touch it!

1078
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,450
Well,
I'm not keeping it in here.

1079
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,653
Shit.

1080
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:00,489
- God,
that's so gross.

1081
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:04,093
Fucking idiots, dude.

1082
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:05,862
I didn't do this.

1083
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:06,929
Yeah, you didn't do it.

1084
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:13,870
What are you doing?

1085
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,138
Nothing.
I'm just waiting for you, man.

1086
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:17,206
Let's go.

1087
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:21,644
None of you guys are ready.

1088
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:23,412
And Mikey's
being difficult. Still.

1089
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:24,580
Are you all right?

1090
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,082
No, I'm not.

1091
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:27,416
Let's go.
- This is just...
I don't want to do it.

1092
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,751
Jeff, you done?

1093
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,402
Hey, I got the email.

1094
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,437
- We're doing the forum?
- Yeah.

1095
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:49,005
All right.

1096
00:56:51,642 --> 00:56:54,510
If you want to move closer,
head toward Baton Rouge.

1097
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:57,446
Ask for Giggles
at the D&D Bar.

1098
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:58,514
Baton Rouge?

1099
00:56:58,515 --> 00:56:59,782
Yeah.

1100
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:02,018
It's...
It's part of the thing.

1101
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:03,152
You're the very one that
wants to stop going to
the Mickey Mouse places.

1102
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:06,422
All right.

1103
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:09,158
Huh?

1104
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,160
There it is.
Now you're going
to get your chance, tough guy.

1105
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:18,701
Look at all
those trash bag pumpkins.

1106
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:23,706
This is a bar?

1107
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,909
Zack?

1108
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:31,480
I'm sorry, guys,
but this is where
they said to go.

1109
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:33,516
He said to ask
the guy at the bar.

1110
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:42,191
Hey, uh, excuse me.

1111
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,626
Sorry to bother you guys.
Uh, I'm supposed
to find a Giggles.

1112
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,196
- You know?
- Giggles?

1113
00:57:48,732 --> 00:57:50,800
Yeah.
I know Giggles.

1114
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:53,135
Oh, yeah. He hangs out here
quite regularly,
matter of fact.

1115
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,704
You all want to
take a seat over there

1116
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:56,872
and make yourselves at home.
He'll be here shortly.

1117
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:57,606
Yeah.

1118
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:01,210
Sit.

1119
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,185
At least we're on
the right track.

1120
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:11,187
Look at
the couple slow dancing.

1121
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:12,488
So weird.

1122
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:15,458
You guys want a drink,
at least?

1123
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:18,427
- Beer.
- Jeff, you want a beer?

1124
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,862
Yeah.

1125
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:21,063
It's just a scare...

1126
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,399
Hey! What's that camera for?

1127
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:35,978
They're cool, the bar.

1128
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,513
Happy with that
kind of service.

1129
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,016
Besides, they don't...
They don't like our kind.

1130
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,922
Holy shit. Turn around.
Turn around, Brandy!

1131
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:47,223
- What? What?
- Turn around.

1132
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:50,626
Oh, my God.

1133
00:58:55,432 --> 00:58:56,599
Wow.

1134
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:20,689
Are you Giggles?

1135
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:30,099
Hey!
All right,
I'll turn it off!

1136
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:30,966
Try that here.

1137
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,605
That guy was
having a good time.

1138
00:59:39,376 --> 00:59:41,143
You looked like you
were having a good time.

1139
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,912
- What?
Okay,
I'm going to the bathroom.

1140
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:43,846
What?

1141
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:47,783
- Hey, we're gonna...
- What's going on, guys?

1142
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:50,619
- We're gonna...
- No, no, no, no, no.

1143
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,821
You want to meet
Mr. Giggles?
He's outside.

1144
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:53,222
Yes.

1145
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:55,057
He won't talk till
the camera is off,
so put it down.

1146
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:57,059
- Sit down.
- It's gonna be you.

1147
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,594
Finally.

1148
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,096
This is not a good idea.

1149
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:04,900
Oh, man, check this out.

1150
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:06,268
What you got there?

1151
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,037
City boys
forgot their camera.

1152
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:09,638
Oh, cool.
Let's go make a movie.

1153
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,173
Yeah, let's make a movie.

1154
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:20,683
Hey, guys,
this is the ladies' room.

1155
01:00:20,684 --> 01:00:22,518
Well, yeah, we know.
How you doing?

1156
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:24,086
Ugh, what are you doing?

1157
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,554
We're shooting
a little video.

1158
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:27,723
Thought that's
what y'all like.

1159
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:30,092
Well, it's not what we're...
It's not what
we're here to do.

1160
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:31,594
We decided to
shoot a little movie.

1161
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:33,028
Did Bobby and Zack
set you up for this?

1162
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,630
Heard you were
looking for Mr. Giggles.

1163
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,432
I got your Mr. Giggles
for you right here, darling.

1164
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:38,033
Stop.

1165
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,668
- Could you just...
- Huh?

1166
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:41,504
Just leave the rest room.

1167
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:43,772
Uh, we're good.
We're doing all right.
Stop!

1168
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,574
Just stop! Guys, get out!

1169
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,209
- Come on, huh?
- What's the matter?

1170
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,544
Just trying
to have a little fun.

1171
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:49,812
Bobby.

1172
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:51,213
They cornered me in there.

1173
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:52,715
What the fuck
you guys doing?

1174
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:54,283
- Shooting a movie, boy.
- Shooting a movie.

1175
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:55,551
That's our camera.
What are you talking about?

1176
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:56,952
We're making a movie.

1177
01:00:56,953 --> 01:01:00,055
Let's go, let's go...

1178
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:03,159
- I'm not saying it's you.
- It's on all of us, all right?

1179
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,060
But it's getting out
of hand, all right?

1180
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,429
They're filming us,
they're posting
this shit online.

1181
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,198
Fucking getting
in Mike's face.

1182
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:10,332
But then when
they go after Brandy,

1183
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,101
that's a whole
different story, man.

1184
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:12,301
We can never
leave her alone again.

1185
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:16,438
They were asking me
for my Facebook,
and I got theirs.

1186
01:01:18,308 --> 01:01:20,709
We were talking
about Extreme Haunts.

1187
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,312
And they said that they were
looking for the same shit.

1188
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,080
I don't know.
They were just, like,

1189
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,715
"Hey, let's exchange
information if you find..."

1190
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,150
They knew what we
were talking about?

1191
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:29,618
Yeah. They said
they've heard of 'em.

1192
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,353
Well, then you're gonna
need to Facebook 'em.

1193
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,821
'Cause we have
the information.

1194
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:34,156
It's in Louisiana this year.

1195
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:35,424
We don't have
an address, though.

1196
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:36,725
- It doesn't matter.
- You know, I'm down,

1197
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:37,993
- but we don't have an address.
- It doesn't matter.

1198
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:39,228
--I have...

1199
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:41,697
- These websites. I'm in...
- Shh, what was that?

1200
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,265
Yeah, but Zack,
that's like nothing.

1201
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,867
Brandy,
when I say Louisiana,
that's where it is...

1202
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,802
--What was that?

1203
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:48,070
You guys,
there's somebody outside.

1204
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,540
Look out the windows.

1205
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,480
It's so hard to see.
Can you even see...

1206
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:01,717
- Shit!
- You guys,
there's somebody out there!

1207
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,952
Brandy, stay here.

1208
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:04,520
- What was that?
- Shh...

1209
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:08,791
- Somebody is on the roof.
- Where?

1210
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,660
Shh.

1211
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:12,695
--Shh.

1212
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,566
--Jeff...

1213
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,201
Be quiet. Shh...

1214
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,670
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

1215
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:25,874
Holy shit. Holy shit.

1216
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,309
What just happened?

1217
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,178
Bobby... Bobby, get it.
Jeff, why is the power out?

1218
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:30,479
Is the door locked?
Is the door locked?

1219
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,314
Yes, it's locked!

1220
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:36,352
Go turn it on.

1221
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:38,354
What do you
see out the window?
I don't see shit.

1222
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:40,189
- I can't see anything.
- Brandy, just stay here.

1223
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,557
Okay.

1224
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:42,858
Do not leave
anybody's side.

1225
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:44,727
Stay away from the sun roof.

1226
01:02:44,728 --> 01:02:47,029
Or,
if I try the engine, dude,
it'll charge the generator.

1227
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Try it!
- I'll just try it. Hold on.
Brandy, stay back.
Shit!
What the fuck?

1228
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:58,073
Bobby, they are every...
They are all around us.

1229
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:00,109
You guys,
what is going on?

1230
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:03,912
What the fuck is going on?

1231
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:05,314
What the...
Jesus, Bobby!

1232
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:07,116
They're outside our...

1233
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:08,450
- Right up against
the window over there!
Seriously!

1234
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,685
- What the fuck?
- Where'd they go?

1235
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:10,753
Where did they go?

1236
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:12,087
There were, like,
50 of them...

1237
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:13,555
- Shut the back.
- ...and they just disappeared.

1238
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,157
Go to the back
and lock the door.

1239
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:17,059
Did they go on the sides?

1240
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,894
- Guys, do you see that?
- I don't know...

1241
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,996
They are starting to phase out
a lot of the traditional stuff

1242
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,702
and starting to go
into this extreme stuff.

1243
01:03:26,703 --> 01:03:28,837
<i>- If I've got a group of...
- Help!</i>

1244
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:30,539
--...six or eight, you know,
 21-year-old males

1245
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,541
<i>and a guy comes up to me
 and tugs on my sleeve,</i>

1246
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:34,343
<i>and he says,
 "Hey, I want it hardcore,"</i>

1247
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:36,078
we'll run him through there.

1248
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,682
I mean, I'll tell the guy,
"I'll do everything
short of killing you."

1249
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:41,650
<i>And they're, like,
 "That's what we want.
 That's what we want."</i>

1250
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,053
And I'll go in there,
and we'll tear 'em up.

1251
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:47,323
We're almost to the point
where we're gonna cuss these
people and gang-rape them.

1252
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:54,897
Brandy,
you doing okay?

1253
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:58,434
Come on, it's our last day.

1254
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:01,470
See a smile on that face.

1255
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:04,907
That's our
Halloween breakfast?

1256
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,409
Yeah.

1257
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,644
Halloween is
just like Christmas.

1258
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:09,845
You get Christmas breakfast.

1259
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:10,946
Halloween breakfast.

1260
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,648
Jack-o-lantern
pancakes then.

1261
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:15,351
Can everybody have
a good time today, please?

1262
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:17,720
Jesus Christ.

1263
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,222
What the fuck was that?

1264
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,457
Do not go outside yet.

1265
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:21,824
Dude... Dude...

1266
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:25,427
- Yeah...
- I'm going.

1267
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:28,731
Do you see anybody?

1268
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:33,168
Why is there a pumpkin
in the middle of nowhere?

1269
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:34,603
Zack, get in...
What are you doing?

1270
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,572
- Get back in the RV.

1271
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:42,244
See anything?

1272
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:43,445
Somebody is here.

1273
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:45,447
I like it.
It says, "Carve me."

1274
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,049
Look what I have.

1275
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:55,424
I think they
went a little too far.

1276
01:04:55,425 --> 01:04:57,326
Got a knife?

1277
01:04:57,327 --> 01:04:59,495
I mean, we are
in the middle of nowhere,
and they found us?

1278
01:04:59,496 --> 01:05:01,430
Yeah, this is what
you've been looking for.

1279
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:08,237
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

1280
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:10,205
Look what we have here.

1281
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:14,009
Stop being dramatic.
What is it?

1282
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,577
It's an invitation.

1283
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,745
Bourbon Street, 10:00 p.m.

1284
01:05:18,782 --> 01:05:21,483
But, I mean how do you know
it's Blue Skeleton?
How the fuck...

1285
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,485
It's what
we've been wanting.

1286
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,020
It's insane now.
There'll be, like,
10,000 people down there.

1287
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:26,221
We gotta try it.

1288
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,924
One more day,
that's all I ask.
It's Halloween.

1289
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,259
We go home tomorrow, okay?

1290
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,560
Yeah, I don't know.

1291
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:32,995
We bring this
to protect us.

1292
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:34,263
Don't be
a smartass right now.

1293
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:35,397
We're going home tomorrow.

1294
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:36,765
Dude, this is what
we've been looking for.

1295
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,734
Yeah, we used to assume
that we were gonna go.

1296
01:05:38,735 --> 01:05:39,868
We are going.

1297
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:41,170
You just... No, you...

1298
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:42,538
You don't give
anybody a chance to talk...

1299
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:44,139
You were really going
to get an invitation,

1300
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,641
and then just,
what are we going to do,

1301
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:47,643
go drink tonight
at a bar?

1302
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:49,578
This is what we've
been looking for,
for a week.

1303
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:50,078
It's Halloween.
We go.

1304
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,715
- Holy shit.
- Wow.

1305
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:58,153
Guys, it's so cool.

1306
01:05:58,154 --> 01:05:59,855
I have the weird...
That's weird.
Halloween.

1307
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,957
That's really...

1308
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,359
That means people
were out here last night
putting those in.

1309
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,494
Zack, go get 'em.

1310
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:06,829
Wow.

1311
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:08,597
They were
sitting around the RV
while we were sleeping.

1312
01:06:08,598 --> 01:06:10,399
Hey. Hey, you all right?

1313
01:06:13,937 --> 01:06:15,671
Brandy,
let's go with it.

1314
01:06:15,672 --> 01:06:16,872
Halloween time.

1315
01:06:16,873 --> 01:06:18,173
Everybody take one.
Let's rock.

1316
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,844
- Ha!
- You're an idiot!

1317
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:30,385
That's not
what we set out to do,

1318
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,454
is to be fucking
surrounded in a field

1319
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:34,356
by fucking weirdos.

1320
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:36,725
Well, if you
kind of think about it,
it's kind of cool.

1321
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:41,730
You kidding me?

1322
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,098
- It's kind of cool.
- Kind of cool?

1323
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:44,533
There is such a difference,
though,

1324
01:06:44,534 --> 01:06:47,002
in wanting extreme shit
and knowing, okay,

1325
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,438
we're going to do
an extreme haunted house,

1326
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:52,374
to brushing teeth
and getting ready to go to bed

1327
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,108
and be surrounded
by redneck hillbilly assholes

1328
01:06:56,813 --> 01:06:58,347
that are, you know,
fucking with us.

1329
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:01,016
And that's not cool
when you don't
know what's going on.

1330
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,785
Nothing actually happened.

1331
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:05,821
Like, just calm down,
all right?

1332
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:08,323
You came on this trip,
you've seen this world,

1333
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:10,893
and now we've got
the opportunity to do
something really cool,

1334
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:12,027
so just relax.

1335
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:43,859
You see anybody
who has a skull mask,

1336
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,694
anything that looks
like it, let me know.

1337
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:47,563
Show me your tits!

1338
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:48,430
Thank you!

1339
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,406
It's not him.
It's not him.

1340
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,446
There's somebody up
there with a skull, Jeff.

1341
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:04,913
- Where?
- See him on the balcony?

1342
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,525
I swear I could see him.

1343
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:28,904
I'm not gonna walk down
this street again!

1344
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,387
Hey!

1345
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,624
- Brandy?

1346
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:55,097
Brandy!

1347
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:06,274
Hey... Bobby!

1348
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,411
Hey!

1349
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,114
Get him... Get him.

1350
01:09:12,115 --> 01:09:13,181
Bobby!

1351
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:14,282
Hey, wait up!

1352
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:17,486
Hey, where you go...
Wait up!

1353
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:20,122
Bobby!

1354
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,430
You wanna
come out and play?

1355
01:09:38,141 --> 01:09:39,574
Someone find my friends.

1356
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:39,941
Over here, boy.
What you looking at?

1357
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1358
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,286
Yeah!

1359
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:54,656
Bring your mouth!

1360
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:58,960
Put out your tongue
and say, "Ah."

1361
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:26,621
You guys going to call him?

1362
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:27,756
Yeah, Zack is.

1363
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,561
I called twice.

1364
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:33,962
What do you mean
you called twice?

1365
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:35,397
- Voice mail says...
- Whose voice mail?

1366
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:36,898
Jeff's voice mail!
It says,

1367
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,034
"If you want to go to
the Blue Skeleton..."

1368
01:10:39,035 --> 01:10:41,203
That gave me an intersection
and said we gotta
be there by midnight.

1369
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:57,219
I can't believe
that we're actually going
to find this place, man.

1370
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:17,806
I can't say I know
what's going on, but just...

1371
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:18,473
We're in this together.

1372
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:22,477
Right, that's fine.
What are you looking for?

1373
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:22,644
Mike.

1374
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,414
I don't know where
the fuck Jeff is,

1375
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:30,952
I do not know
what is going on.

1376
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,989
We're either going to
the end of this road,
or going the fuck home.

1377
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:36,158
What do you want to do?
You want to
leave him out there?

1378
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,727
There's no
fucking chance.
He's up!

1379
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:41,463
I don't see
anything outside, though.

1380
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:42,964
Somebody is coming.

1381
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:51,306
Whoa.
Zack, what is this, man?

1382
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,841
What's going on?

1383
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:54,943
- What the...

1384
01:11:56,946 --> 01:11:57,846
What are we gonna do?

1385
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,385
Oh, come on.

1386
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:12,060
This is... Fuck...

1387
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:12,661
What?

1388
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:17,766
"Sixty seconds, come outside,
or your friend will die."

1389
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:18,366
- It's a text message?
- What the fuck?

1390
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:24,673
This is not
all right, man.

1391
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,377
"Forty-five seconds."

1392
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:32,981
Fuck this, dude,
I'm not scared of them.

1393
01:12:32,982 --> 01:12:34,449
Let's get out there.
This isn't real, right?

1394
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:40,288
Is this the haunt?
What is this?

1395
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:42,090
"You will be scared.
Thirty seconds."

1396
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:44,025
Can they fucking hear us?

1397
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,461
You guys,
what's going on here?

1398
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:48,463
It's...
It's just gotta be them.

1399
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:49,831
What else do we do?

1400
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:50,398
Zack?

1401
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:53,168
Dude, get back in the RV!

1402
01:12:53,169 --> 01:12:54,236
Come on!

1403
01:13:02,178 --> 01:13:02,410
Shit!

1404
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:05,680
"Surprise."

1405
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:11,586
What the hell
is going on?

1406
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:12,821
There is glass everywhere,
Bobby.

1407
01:13:12,822 --> 01:13:14,289
Stay down, Brandy.

1408
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:17,292
Jesus-fucking-Christ!
Why are they doing this to us?

1409
01:13:17,293 --> 01:13:19,995
Holy shit.

1410
01:13:19,996 --> 01:13:21,596
- Stay down.
- Can you see Zack?

1411
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:22,264
--Holy shit.

1412
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:25,600
Get it.

1413
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:31,673
"Don't look up."

1414
01:13:35,311 --> 01:13:36,745
What the fuck man?

1415
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:41,483
I don't want
to fucking play along!

1416
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:43,084
- Get off me!
- Get the fuck off!

1417
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,186
Do not fucking hurt her!

1418
01:13:51,227 --> 01:13:52,460
Jesus Christ.

1419
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:55,797
Brandy?

1420
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,240
Brandy, stay close.

1421
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:06,608
Okay.

1422
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,737
Where are we going?

1423
01:14:35,738 --> 01:14:37,272
Guys,
you know what this is.
Just relax.

1424
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:41,476
A little hard
to relax, Zack.

1425
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,011
Zack, shut the fuck up.

1426
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,020
Oh, my God.

1427
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:53,121
Ah, fuck!

1428
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:54,522
Get off me!

1429
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,558
What is going on, Mike?
What's happening?

1430
01:14:56,559 --> 01:14:58,159
Get the fuck off me!

1431
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,761
--All right, All right.

1432
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,897
Jesus!

1433
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:05,533
All right. These guys
have got a fuckin' bat.

1434
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,599
- What?
- What's going on, Mike?

1435
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,968
Michael,
just do what they want.

1436
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:41,202
All right, all right.

1437
01:15:51,614 --> 01:15:53,214
Michael?

1438
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,523
He's just
messing with you, Brandy.

1439
01:16:04,193 --> 01:16:05,460
Okay.

1440
01:16:05,461 --> 01:16:06,161
What's going on?

1441
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:11,499
- They are moving me outside.
- All right, I'll go!

1442
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:15,703
Hey Zack,
are you going too?

1443
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,072
I guess, are you?

1444
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,873
- No.
- Zack!

1445
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:21,543
Wait, you guys,
don't leave me in here alone.

1446
01:16:21,544 --> 01:16:23,511
Zack,
bring her with you!

1447
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:24,479
You guys!

1448
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,682
- Brandy!
- Oh, shit.

1449
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,117
Brandy!

1450
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:30,919
Brandy!

1451
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,454
Fucking shit!

1452
01:16:32,455 --> 01:16:33,822
Brandy!

1453
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:35,156
- Brandy!
- Guys!

1454
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:35,290
- Guys!
- Brandy!

1455
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:38,626
Bring her out!

1456
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:46,935
Fuck, I don't want
to be here alone.

1457
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,310
Count to 30...

1458
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:30,678
...and remove your hood.

1459
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:36,050
There is going to
be a video camera

1460
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:36,684
sitting right next to you.

1461
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:40,021
Pick it up...

1462
01:17:42,558 --> 01:17:45,393
...and record
everything you see.

1463
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,730
And remember...

1464
01:17:50,266 --> 01:17:51,132
...we'll be watching.

1465
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:56,164
I can't see a goddamn thing.

1466
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,801
Oh, my God,
this is ridiculous.

1467
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:03,338
Shit.

1468
01:19:10,379 --> 01:19:12,580
Zack?

1469
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:15,116
Bobby?

1470
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,453
I'm supposed to be filming.

1471
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:21,789
Oh, shit.

1472
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:29,330
Dammit.

1473
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:30,832
I swear to Christ,
Bobby, if y'all are
fucking with me...

1474
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:34,602
Honestly, I just
want to get the... Fuck!

1475
01:19:38,307 --> 01:19:41,209
All right, look,
I'm fucking over this.

1476
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:47,482
All right, I'm done. I'm done!
What the fuck am
I supposed to do?

1477
01:19:50,386 --> 01:19:51,919
Hello!

1478
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,620
Zack! Bobby!

1479
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:56,691
This is crazy shit.

1480
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:01,429
Hello?

1481
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:02,630
Hello?

1482
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:04,866
Fuck.

1483
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:16,611
Zack?

1484
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,986
Oh, fuck.

1485
01:20:31,527 --> 01:20:34,362
Holy Jesus Christ, man!

1486
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:37,098
Dude, I am done!
Just let me out. I give up...

1487
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:39,934
What the fuck?
Get me out of here now!

1488
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:43,271
You look...

1489
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:53,881
Jesus Christ!

1490
01:20:55,084 --> 01:20:58,353
Hey, hey! How the fuck
do I get out of here?

1491
01:20:58,354 --> 01:20:59,721
What the fuck?

1492
01:20:59,722 --> 01:21:01,656
- What the fuck!

1493
01:21:01,657 --> 01:21:02,623
Oh, shit.

1494
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:08,262
Okay.

1495
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:20,208
No!

1496
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:22,877
Can any of you
guys hear me in here?

1497
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:26,447
All right, we're done!

1498
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:29,784
What the fuck?

1499
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:35,156
What the fuck, man!

1500
01:21:35,157 --> 01:21:37,792
- Get me the fuck out of here!
- Bobby, where are you?

1501
01:21:37,793 --> 01:21:40,762
Get me out of here!
Get me the fuck out of here!

1502
01:21:40,763 --> 01:21:42,930
- Get me the fuck...

1503
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:45,833
Get me the fuck...
Bobby! Mikey!

1504
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:48,136
Somebody fucking answer me!

1505
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:49,871
What's going on?

1506
01:21:49,872 --> 01:21:51,105
Fuck!

1507
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:01,716
Jesus.

1508
01:22:01,717 --> 01:22:02,316
Hey, man, tell me you know
how to get out of
this fucking place.

1509
01:22:05,454 --> 01:22:06,788
Hey.

1510
01:22:06,789 --> 01:22:07,955
What the fuck is this?

1511
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:12,827
Your props are
really fucking scary!

1512
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:14,328
Oh! Shit.

1513
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hello?
What the fuck is going on?
Hello!
Hello!

1514
01:22:22,838 --> 01:22:24,071
--Oh, shit!

1515
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:27,809
Michael! Mike!

1516
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:28,910
Michael, I'm in here man!

1517
01:22:30,813 --> 01:22:32,547
- Get me the fuck out!
- Mike!

1518
01:22:32,548 --> 01:22:34,449
- God dammit!
What the fuck is wrong?
- Bobby?

1519
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,783
- Michael?
- Bobby!

1520
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,151
Michael!

1521
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:39,120
- Guys, can you hear me?
- No! Look at the door.

1522
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:40,488
Get the fuck out!

1523
01:22:40,489 --> 01:22:42,323
Get the fuck
out of there now!

1524
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:43,658
- Find the door!

1525
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:45,860
Michael! Michael!

1526
01:22:45,861 --> 01:22:46,260
Come on.
Come on, there's
gotta be a light in here.

1527
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:50,965
Come on.

1528
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:57,839
Coming through!
Pardon me!

1529
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:01,342
Stop it!

1530
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:03,044
Please stop!

1531
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:08,816
- Just get
me out of here!

1532
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,551
Please get me out of here!

1533
01:23:12,621 --> 01:23:15,122
- I'm going to fuck your world!
- No...

1534
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:21,362
Brandy?

1535
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:23,931
Guys,
somebody please talk to me.

1536
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:26,501
Please God,
please God, please God.

1537
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,073
Zack?

1538
01:23:32,074 --> 01:23:34,609
Zack, what the fuck
are you doing in here, man?

1539
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:36,477
We got to get out of here.

1540
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:38,913
This is not a fucking haunt.

1541
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,382
You having fun, Bobby?

1542
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:44,605
Help!

1543
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:45,406
Help!

1544
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:47,508

1545
01:25:48,677 --> 01:25:49,377
Bobby!

1546
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:53,381
Please help!

1547
01:25:55,117 --> 01:25:56,784
Help me!

1548
01:25:58,453 --> 01:25:59,920
Can anybody hear me!

1549
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:13,034
I can't breathe in here!

1550
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:34,522
Please!

1551
01:26:35,624 --> 01:26:37,725
Please!

1552
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,375
Help!

1553
01:26:58,046 --> 01:26:59,647
Help!

1554
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:00,381
Please help me!

1555
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:03,217
Please...

1556
01:27:03,852 --> 01:27:06,420
Help!

1557
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:19,166
<i>What's the best
part about your job?</i>

1558
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:23,003
I'm... I'm not me
for five hours a day.

1559
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:30,811
And if I can get out
of the tangled up mess,

1560
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:33,547
that is my head
and into somebody else's head.

1561
01:27:33,548 --> 01:27:36,584
All that pent-up aggression
is now taken out on somebody,

1562
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:38,652
and, you know,

1563
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:42,690
be as vicious and mean
as I can towards anybody
to scare 'em.

1564
01:27:42,691 --> 01:27:46,794
You want to make it so that
they're not gonna escape.

1565
01:27:46,795 --> 01:27:50,064
Right?
I mean, that's the thing,
we don't want them to escape.

1566
01:27:50,065 --> 01:27:53,334
If I were a zombie
and they came out here,

1567
01:27:53,335 --> 01:27:55,803
my goal is to eat their
brains and survive, right?

1568
01:27:55,804 --> 01:27:58,606
And, um, their goal
is to not make it out,

1569
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:01,041
or try to make it out
if they can.

1570
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:03,210
Um.

1571
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:05,713
They're coming out here
and it's going to be
their last visit anywhere.
