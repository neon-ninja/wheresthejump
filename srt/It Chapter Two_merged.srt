<i>You'll float, too!</i>

3
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,479
<i>You'll float, too!</i>

4
00:00:29,546 --> 00:00:31,581
<i>You'll float, too!</i>

5
00:00:39,357 --> 00:00:41,125
I saw all of us.

6
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:44,095
All of us were there.

7
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:46,964
Back in the cistern.

8
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:50,767
But we were older.

9
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,602
We were our parents' ages.

10
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:55,139
Am I still handsome
as an adult?

11
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,175
You grow into your looks.

12
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:00,077
What the fuck does that mean?

13
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,747
What about me?

14
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:06,884
Like now,

15
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:08,052
but taller.

16
00:01:16,793 --> 00:01:17,794
Swear it.

17
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:22,432
Swear if It isn't dead,

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,502
if It ever comes back,

19
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:26,770
we'll come back, too.

20
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:32,776
<i>Memory,</i>

21
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:36,546
<i>it's a funny thing.</i>

22
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:40,717
<i>People want to
believe they are</i>

23
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:42,485
<i>what they choose
to remember.</i>

24
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:45,488
<i>The good stuff.</i>

25
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,025
<i>The moments.</i>

26
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,761
<i>The places.</i>

27
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,566
<i>The people
we all hold on to.</i>

28
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:00,637
<i>But sometimes...</i>

29
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:04,607
<i>sometimes</i>

30
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:09,180
<i>we are what we wish
we could forget.</i>

31
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,138
Okay, kids.

32
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:36,140
Get ready.

33
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:37,507
Go!

34
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:39,676
Who's it gonna be?

35
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,178
First one to pop
their balloon's a winner!

36
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,080
It could be anyone!
We got a real

37
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:45,449
- barn burner here, folks.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

38
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:46,851
It's getting close.

39
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,519
Who's gonna catch the
leader, huh?

40
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,123
Who's gonna be
the big winner tonight?

41
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:53,391
- Oh, yeah!
- Whoo!

42
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:56,160
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

43
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:57,594
- Thank you.
- Wow.

44
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,230
You really showed 'em, huh?

45
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:00,663
I did. I...

46
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,900
Yeah.

47
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:06,904
Hey, girl, do you want this?

48
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:08,305
Thanks
for letting me win.

49
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:11,574
Yeah.

50
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:12,742
What'd you get, Vicky?

51
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:13,978
Aww.
Such a gentleman.

52
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:16,147
Look at that!

53
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:19,350
Well, here is
your consolation prize.

54
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:20,784
Look at that.

55
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:23,087
Never been a fan
of the beaver,

56
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:25,588
but look at this hat.
I mean...

57
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:27,291
Thank you.

58
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,097
So, we need
to talk logistics.

59
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:35,099
Ooh. How romantic.

60
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,766
Romantic?

61
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,702
What's so
fucking romantic, huh?

62
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:44,141
Hey.

63
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,043
Your mommas ever teach you
boys to respond to someone

64
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,744
when they ask you
a fucking question?

65
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:49,880
Come on, Adrian.

66
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:53,050
You got a problem, faggot?

67
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:58,289
I don't,
but Meg Ryan called.

68
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:00,590
She wants her wig back.

69
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,724
All right. All right.

70
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,693
Come on.
Come on, Adrian.

71
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:09,867
Stuff like that is

72
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:11,402
why I have to leave
this shithole town.

73
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:12,536
Small minds.

74
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:13,670
They have small dicks.

75
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:15,139
I'm being serious.

76
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:16,373
We belong elsewhere.

77
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,175
Hey, look,
if you end up hating New York,

78
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:20,578
we can always
move back here.

79
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:22,146
I just want
to be with you.

80
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:24,215
I don't care.
New York, Derry, whatever. It's...

81
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,748
You have to say that.

82
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:26,951
I don't have
to say anything.

83
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,053
Take off that fucking hat.

84
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,988
- Oh, God.
- Come on, let's go.

85
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:32,789
Wouldn't want to
give people the impression

86
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:34,525
we allow a bunch of fucking
fairies like you in this town.

87
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:36,060
Yeah, he was
born here, asshole.

88
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:38,963
- All right, let's go.
- No. You know what?

89
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,297
I'll take off the hat
for you.

90
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,932
But why leave it there?

91
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:43,400
Anything else
you would like me

92
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,136
to take off
for you tonight?

93
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,305
Any special requests, ladies?

94
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:51,674
Fucker!

95
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:54,478
Let him go!

96
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:02,685
- What's that?
- Stop.

97
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:04,622
I don't think
you'll be needing that.

98
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:06,656
- Leave him alone!
- Hit him.

99
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,393
He's got asthma, fucker!

100
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:17,067
Come on!

101
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:18,936
Fuck him up!

102
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:21,071
Come on,
kick him!

103
00:05:21,138 --> 00:05:22,339
Come on,
kick the shit out of him.

104
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,275
Adrian!

105
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:30,747
I still hate
your fucking hair.

106
00:05:33,184 --> 00:05:35,319
Adrian!

107
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:37,321
Get the fuck off him!

108
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,291
Look what you did
to his fucking face!

109
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:43,793
Hey! Hey!
Help me get him up.

110
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:45,296
Adrian.

111
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:48,098
Help me get this fucking
punk up right now.

112
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,240
Give me the hat, Chris.

113
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:57,208
It's fucking mine!

114
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,043
I said give me
the fucking hat!

115
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:02,513
Adrian!

116
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:05,049
You like that?

117
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,151
Welcome to Derry,
motherfucker.

118
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,554
No! Adrian!

119
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,989
No!

120
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,093
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

121
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,895
- Let's go!
- No!

122
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:25,369
Adrian!

123
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:27,471
Help!

124
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:30,507
Help me!

125
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,943
Somebody!

126
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:38,515
Somebody fucking help me!

127
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:53,964
Oh...

128
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,869
Adrian.

129
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,880
No!

130
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:15,586
Adrian!

131
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:26,829
<i>We all
float down here!</i>

132
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:32,169
<i>Thing is,</i>

133
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:35,139
<i>sometimes what we wish
was forgotten,</i>

134
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:39,143
<i>what we tried to
leave in the past,</i>

135
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:42,946
<i>won't stay there.</i>

136
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,517
<i>Units, please respond.</i>

137
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,452
<i>I'm getting reports of a
body found dismembered.</i>

138
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,921
<i>Come back.
Was that "dismembered"?</i>

139
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:52,289
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

140
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:53,524
<i>Scene is near
the south entrance</i>

141
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,925
<i>of the festival grounds.</i>

142
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:56,460
<i>Copy that. En route.</i>

143
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:57,761
<i>Any directive for TC?</i>

144
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,563
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

145
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,498
<i>Chief said to tape off
the Derry Street Bridge.</i>

146
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:04,301
<i>Sometimes,
it comes back for you.</i>

147
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,012
Ah.

148
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,349
Mr. Denbrough?
They need you on set.

149
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,190
We're just going to
go this way.

150
00:09:33,257 --> 00:09:35,092
- I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
- No, don't!

151
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,693
Hey!
Clear the door!

152
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,028
Oh, come on.
You've never seen <i>Indiana Jones?</i>

153
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:39,963
Watch your back.

154
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,532
Hey, hey.
You a crewmember?

155
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:43,200
I'm the writer.

156
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:54,311
Your husband's here.

157
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:56,447
Hey!
Do you have the pages?

158
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,016
Everyone,
keep clear of the crane.

159
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:02,786
My friend,
a film needs an ending.

160
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:04,555
- You do know that, right?
- Oh, yeah.

161
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:06,623
You said that
you needed another day

162
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,058
to finish the pages,

163
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,092
and we're shooting this thing.
It's tonight.

164
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,194
That's, like, 17 hours...

165
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,495
Everybody, calm down, okay?

166
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:12,629
I'm calm.

167
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,465
I want you to be
happy with the movie.

168
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,266
You understand?
I'm on your side.

169
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,135
That's great.
'Cause in my book, the ending...

170
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,703
Is terrible.

171
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,539
All due respect,
people loved your book. Loved.

172
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:24,074
They hated the ending.

173
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:25,843
You said
you liked the ending.

174
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,344
That was a lie.

175
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:29,546
- We gotta do better, okay?
- Yeah.

176
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:32,549
Audra, you have my notes.
Would you...

177
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:35,519
Okay, thank you very much.
Take me back to one, please.

178
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:36,820
Bye.

179
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:38,890
You have his notes?

180
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:40,892
He's not wrong.

181
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,626
You hate my endings, too?

182
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:44,094
Not all your endings.

183
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:45,229
But this...

184
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:47,297
- Okay.
- Just...

185
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:49,633
What? Do you want me
to keep lying to you

186
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,802
- just because I'm your wife?
- You're my wife?

187
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,370
No. No.
But you know what?

188
00:10:53,437 --> 00:10:55,305
You've been blowing smoke
up my ass for eight years?

189
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:56,707
I guess I thought
you were someone else.

190
00:10:56,773 --> 00:10:59,510
I have not been
blowing smoke up your ass.

191
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,712
Everybody wants
a happy ending.

192
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:03,113
Everybody wants closure.

193
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,781
But that's not
the way life works out.

194
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:07,184
I think what Peter wants
and what the studio wants...

195
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,686
The studio?
When'd you become a company man?

196
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,221
Jesus, you're an artist.

197
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:12,689
Come on.
What's wrong with just doing it

198
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,491
the way it's written?
The way I wanted.

199
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:15,692
What's wrong with being
the woman I want you to be?

200
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,996
Fuck you, Bill.

201
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:21,131
On the page.
The part, I mean. Not you.

202
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:29,473
Hello?

203
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,376
<i>Bill Denbrough?
It's Mike.</i>

204
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,443
Mike who?

205
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:36,346
Mike Hanlon.

206
00:11:36,413 --> 00:11:38,315
<i>From Derry.</i>

207
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:47,224
You need to come home.

208
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:54,698
<i>Eddie,
I keep telling you</i>

209
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:56,233
<i>not to scare me
like this.</i>

210
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,534
<i>And you never
listen to me.</i>

211
00:11:57,601 --> 00:11:59,037
All right. Myra, please.
Not now.

212
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,338
You shouldn't be out there.

213
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:02,606
Eddie, it's not safe
to drive

214
00:12:02,673 --> 00:12:04,074
when the roads
are slick like this.

215
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,208
Sweetheart,
it stopped raining, like,

216
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:06,710
three hours ago.
All right?

217
00:12:06,777 --> 00:12:08,612
Everything is gonna be fine.

218
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,881
Hey, dickhead!
Flow of traffic mean anything to you?

219
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:11,181
What if you hydroplane?

220
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:12,951
I'm not gonna hydroplane.

221
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:14,718
It is my job
to assess risk.

222
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:16,453
So, please trust me
when I tell you

223
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,821
that, statistically speaking,

224
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:19,523
I am much more likely to
get into an accident

225
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,758
because I am talking
to you on the phone!

226
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,193
All right?
I have to go.

227
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,963
I will talk to you soon.
Goodbye.

228
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:28,565
Edward Kaspbrak speaking.

229
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:30,001
<i>You didn't say,
"Okay, bye, I love you,"</i>

230
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:31,134
<i>like you usually do.</i>

231
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:32,402
Listen to me. I can't!

232
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:33,470
I'm going to be
late to this...

233
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:35,940
meeting.

234
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:37,240
<i>Say "I love you," Eddie.</i>

235
00:12:37,307 --> 00:12:39,077
Okay, I love you, Mommy.

236
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:40,811
What?

237
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:42,880
Myra. Bye.

238
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:45,649
Hello? Who's this?

239
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:47,018
<i>It's me. Mike.</i>

240
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:48,285
Mike who?

241
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:52,522
<i>Eddie! You okay?</i>

242
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:54,391
Yeah,
I'm pretty good.

243
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,798
Dude! Dude,
what the fuck?

244
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,567
You were fine, like,
five seconds ago.

245
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:05,870
Who was it? Who called? Huh?

246
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:08,271
Rich? Rich?
Talk to me.

247
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:10,041
You're on in two minutes.
You good?

248
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:11,808
'Cause you look not good.

249
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:15,178
- I'm fine.
- You're fine? Okay.

250
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:16,747
And we're walking.
We're walking.

251
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:17,949
Sixty seconds.

252
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:19,249
Even faster. All right.

253
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:20,517
Can we get him
a bottle of water, maybe?

254
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:22,552
- Bourbon.
- Bourbon. Sure, sure.

255
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:24,088
And a mint.

256
00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:25,689
It is showtime.

257
00:13:25,756 --> 00:13:27,357
- I don't think I can do this.
- It's what you do.

258
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:29,093
- You kill. You're a killer.
- That was fast.

259
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,862
Okay. We are
good to go, and...

260
00:13:30,928 --> 00:13:32,529
Hey! Where we going?
Where we going?

261
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:33,865
No. This way. Attaboy.

262
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:35,432
Okay.

263
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:38,002
All right.
How do I look?

264
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:39,836
Your hands are shaking, Rich.

265
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:41,204
Shit.

266
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:42,706
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

267
00:13:42,773 --> 00:13:45,375
<i>please welcome Richie Tozier!</i>

268
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,918
All right.
How are we doing tonight?

269
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,990
So, my girlfriend
caught me masturbating

270
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:00,925
to her friend's Facebook page.

271
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:05,362
And so now
I'm in Masturbators Anonymous.

272
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:08,265
And I stand up
at the first meeting

273
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:11,102
and I say, "My name
is Richie Trashmouth."

274
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:13,071
- <i>Trashmouth.</i>
- <i>Shut up, Richie.</i>

275
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:15,139
- <i>Fucking perv.</i>
- <i>Shut up, Richie.</i>

276
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:16,306
<i>Pussy!</i>

277
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:18,275
Trashmouth. Uh...

278
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:22,312
Forgot the joke.

279
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:24,448
You suck!

280
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:29,887
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

281
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:31,588
for letting us
present to you today.

282
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:35,193
Now, this will include
over a million square feet

283
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:38,328
of commercial
and residential space.

284
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:39,964
State-of-the-art
office towers.

285
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:42,399
What I'm really looking for
is to understand

286
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,368
how we create even more
retail opportunities.

287
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:48,705
If we put in walls here
and all along here...

288
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:50,373
<i>Lose them.</i>

289
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:54,778
<i>With all due respect,
Mr. Hanscom...</i>

290
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:58,149
Ben, please.
And with all due respect to you,

291
00:14:58,216 --> 00:14:59,516
I'm getting claustrophobic

292
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,053
just looking at this model.
Aren't you?

293
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,622
Look. Throw up more walls,
it's gonna feel like a prison.

294
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:07,191
You know what people
want to do in prison?

295
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:09,060
Get out. Right?

296
00:15:09,127 --> 00:15:12,029
This should be a place
that brings people together.

297
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:13,965
A meeting ground.

298
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,273
A clubhouse.

299
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,642
<i>And if,</i>

300
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:27,577
while people are there...

301
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:33,017
<i>Excuse me
for one second.</i>

302
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:40,858
- Hello?
- <i>Ben?</i>

303
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:43,760
<i>It's Mike Hanlon.
From Derry.</i>

304
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,413
Should I just book it?

305
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,149
You're sure you can
get away from work?

306
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:06,716
It's summer, why not?

307
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,254
Okay, we are
Buenos Aires-bound.

308
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:25,937
Stanley Uris speaking.

309
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:29,006
It's Mike.

310
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:30,174
I'm sorry?

311
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:31,708
<i>Mike Hanlon.</i>

312
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,844
<i>From Derry.</i>

313
00:16:36,047 --> 00:16:37,514
Mike.

314
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,017
God, sorry. Yes, hi.

315
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:42,385
I don't
know why I didn't...

316
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:47,091
How long's it been?

317
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:48,692
A long time.

318
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,761
<i>27 years.</i>

319
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:00,304
It's come back,
hasn't it?

320
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,571
<i>That's why
you're calling me?</i>

321
00:17:01,638 --> 00:17:03,773
It's starting again, Stan.

322
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,709
<i>Bad things are happening.</i>

323
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:06,911
Did you call the others?

324
00:17:06,978 --> 00:17:09,247
I mean,
what if they don't come?

325
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:12,216
We made a promise,
remember?

326
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:13,817
<i>How soon
can you get here?</i>

327
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:15,685
Um...

328
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:17,021
Well, I...

329
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:19,290
Yeah, I would need to
do a few things...

330
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:20,992
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

331
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,560
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

332
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:26,763
<i>I'll text you
everything you need.</i>

333
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:29,432
I'll see you soon,
Stan the Man.

334
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:08,906
Do you swear?

335
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:18,515
I swear, Bill.

336
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,331
<i>You made
a promise, Beverly.</i>

337
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:09,200
I'm so sorry, Mike.

338
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:11,835
I don't even really remember.

339
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,703
Haven't you ever wondered
why you can't seem

340
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,839
to remember the things
most people should

341
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:19,609
<i>about where they're from,
about who they are,</i>

342
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:21,611
<i>why you have that scar
on your hand?</i>

343
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:26,649
<i>No one else remembered,
either.</i>

344
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:30,121
<i>Eddie, Ben, Stan, Richie...</i>

345
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:31,255
<i>Bill.</i>

346
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:32,722
Bill.

347
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:35,525
You have to come back.

348
00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:38,162
You all do.

349
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,765
When?

350
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Whoa.

351
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:00,418
Are you okay?
What's going on?

352
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:04,621
It's the middle of the night.
You're packing?

353
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:06,123
I didn't want to wake
you, honey.

354
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,558
I know this week's
been really exhausting.

355
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,729
I just got a phone call from
an old friend from Derry.

356
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:17,134
I have to go back there.

357
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:19,103
It's really hard
to explain why.

358
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,171
It's okay.

359
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:24,841
You don't have to explain
yourself to me. Relax.

360
00:20:25,443 --> 00:20:26,977
I trust you.

361
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:28,245
Thank you.

362
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:35,585
I just don't understand
why you'd lie to me.

363
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:41,258
I heard you.

364
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:45,062
You said the name Mike.

365
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:46,130
Yes, my friend.

366
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:47,998
See, there was
a group of us back then,

367
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:50,201
and we all made a promise to
each other when we were kids.

368
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:53,170
You know trust is everything
in a relationship.

369
00:20:53,237 --> 00:20:56,574
You know
it's everything to me, right?

370
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:58,608
- I know. This isn't...
- Right?

371
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,610
What?
Like the last time?

372
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,446
I never cheated on you.

373
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:03,914
You're a bad fucking liar,

374
00:21:03,981 --> 00:21:05,149
Bev.

375
00:21:05,216 --> 00:21:07,717
You're not going anywhere,
okay?

376
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:10,421
I want you to stay right here,

377
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:11,856
and you're gonna show me

378
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:14,258
what it is you're gonna
do with Mike. Okay?

379
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:15,860
You're hurting me, honey.

380
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:17,995
No one else is
gonna love you like me.

381
00:21:18,062 --> 00:21:19,296
You know that, right?

382
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:22,366
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:30,040
Don't make this
fucking harder!

384
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:31,242
Don't.

385
00:21:57,201 --> 00:22:00,204
You're nothing without me!
You know that, right?

386
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:01,906
Tell me I'm wrong!

387
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

388
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:18,215
Jesus Christ.

389
00:23:18,282 --> 00:23:19,849
Boys.

390
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:22,386
Little prick's got balls,
I'll give him that.

391
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:23,520
Far enough, Bowers!

392
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:24,821
I'm not done yet.

393
00:23:24,888 --> 00:23:26,257
I'm not done.
I'm not fucking done.

394
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,725
- On your knees.
- I can't. No!

395
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,826
I gotta kill them all!
Fuck, fuck!

396
00:23:29,893 --> 00:23:31,462
Fucking kill them all!
Stop it!

397
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:34,665
- Cuff this sorry sack of shit!
- Fuck you!

398
00:23:34,732 --> 00:23:36,133
Fuck you!

399
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,068
Henry Bowers,
I am placing you under arrest

400
00:23:38,135 --> 00:23:39,870
for the murder
of Oscar Bowers.

401
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:42,106
Do you understand, dipshit?

402
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,975
You have the right
to an attorney.

403
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:47,144
You have the right
to remain silent.

404
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:33,924
Bowers!

405
00:24:33,991 --> 00:24:36,860
Bowers, calm the fuck down!

406
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:48,305
Someone needs a little extra
clozapine today, don't they?

407
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:51,608
Stay in your fucking room.

408
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

409
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:53,504
Hockstetter.

410
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:59,143
My knife.

411
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:15,959
- Whoa.
- Careful.

412
00:26:16,026 --> 00:26:17,561
This way.

413
00:26:17,628 --> 00:26:19,196
Thanks a lot.

414
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:24,435
- Hey.
- Oh...

415
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:25,836
- Mike, you look good.
- Bill.

416
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:28,338
Yup. Whoa.
Hey. How you doing?

417
00:26:28,907 --> 00:26:30,140
Bill.

418
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:32,342
I didn't know
if any of you would...

419
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:33,477
I mean,
after all this time...

420
00:26:33,544 --> 00:26:34,812
- Yeah.
- But of course you came.

421
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:36,947
You know,
an oath is an oath.

422
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:38,982
Losers

423
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,685
gotta stick together, right?

424
00:26:41,752 --> 00:26:42,887
The Losers.

425
00:26:42,953 --> 00:26:45,289
You remember that.
That's good.

426
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,991
What else do you remember?

427
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:49,359
I am allergic to soy,

428
00:26:49,426 --> 00:26:51,428
anything that has egg in
it, uh, gluten,

429
00:26:51,495 --> 00:26:55,432
and if I eat a cashew,
I could realistically die.

430
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,402
Holy shit.

431
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,519
Is there a password
or something?

432
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:19,289
I'm sorry.

433
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:21,758
The new kid.

434
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:24,027
Ben?

435
00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:25,996
Yeah.

436
00:27:27,998 --> 00:27:29,066
Oh, my God.

437
00:27:29,132 --> 00:27:31,268
Oh, my God.

438
00:27:31,335 --> 00:27:33,537
It's been so long.

439
00:27:36,473 --> 00:27:38,475
<i>Stay cool,
Ben from soc class.</i>

440
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:40,344
<i>You too, Beverly.</i>

441
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,678
<i>Hang tough,
new kid on the block.</i>

442
00:27:43,847 --> 00:27:45,048
Wow.

443
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,784
You two look amazing.

444
00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:50,020
What the fuck
happened to me?

445
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- What's going on, man?
- Hey, man.
- It's Richie. Hi.
- Yeah. It's Ben.
- Hi.
- Hey.

446
00:28:00,197 --> 00:28:01,331
This meeting
of the Losers' Club

447
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:02,699
has officially begun.

448
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:04,101
Look at these guys.

449
00:28:07,204 --> 00:28:08,438
Ben.

450
00:28:15,045 --> 00:28:16,513
So, wait, Eddie,
you got married?

451
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,016
Yeah, why's that so fucking
funny, dickwad?

452
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:19,449
What?
To, like, a woman?

453
00:28:19,516 --> 00:28:21,418
Fuck you, bro.

454
00:28:21,485 --> 00:28:22,887
Fuck you!

455
00:28:22,954 --> 00:28:24,254
All right. What about you, Trashmouth?
You married?

456
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:26,089
There's no way
Richie's married.

457
00:28:26,156 --> 00:28:27,357
No, I got married.

458
00:28:27,424 --> 00:28:28,692
- Richie, I don't believe it.
- When?

459
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:30,127
- Did you not hear this?
- No.

460
00:28:30,193 --> 00:28:31,395
You didn't know
I got married?

461
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:32,596
- No.
- Yeah, no. Me and your mom

462
00:28:32,663 --> 00:28:34,631
are very, very happy
right now.

463
00:28:34,698 --> 00:28:36,233
Yeah, very happy.

464
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,367
- He totally fell for it!
- Thanks.

465
00:28:38,903 --> 00:28:40,504
Fuck you.

466
00:28:40,571 --> 00:28:42,673
She's very sweet.
Sometimes, she'll put her arm around me,

467
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:44,775
and she'll whisper to me,
she'll go...

468
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:50,647
We all get it.
My mom was a great, big, fat person.

469
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:52,082
Shh.

470
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:54,251
Hilarious. Hysterical.

471
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,956
Yeah,
it's a nice watch.

472
00:28:58,022 --> 00:29:00,457
Wait, let's talk about the
elephant not in the room...

473
00:29:00,524 --> 00:29:01,658
Ben.

474
00:29:01,725 --> 00:29:02,994
What the fuck, man?

475
00:29:03,061 --> 00:29:04,929
Okay, okay.
Obviously, I lost a few pounds.

476
00:29:04,996 --> 00:29:06,730
- Lost a few pounds?
- Yeah, no shit you lost

477
00:29:06,797 --> 00:29:08,231
- a few pounds.
- You're, like... You're hot!

478
00:29:08,298 --> 00:29:09,833
That's true.

479
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:11,335
No, you're like
every Brazilian soccer player

480
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,569
wrapped up into one person.
Gorgeous.

481
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:14,571
Leave him alone.
You're embarrassing him.

482
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:16,406
Okay, okay, all right.
Please, come on.

483
00:29:16,473 --> 00:29:18,208
Is Stanley coming
or what?

484
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:19,710
Someone save me.

485
00:29:21,812 --> 00:29:23,213
Stan.

486
00:29:24,615 --> 00:29:26,084
Stan...

487
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:28,352
Stan Uris.
Stan Urine.

488
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:30,721
Stanley Urine.
No, no, he's a fucking pussy.

489
00:29:30,787 --> 00:29:31,688
He's not gonna show.

490
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:33,690
Why would
Stanley save you, anyway?

491
00:29:33,757 --> 00:29:35,359
Was I not the one
who basically

492
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:36,727
performed surgery on you

493
00:29:36,793 --> 00:29:38,128
- after Bowers cut you up?
- Yes!

494
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:39,796
Holy shit!
That's right.

495
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:41,365
Please tell me you ended
up becoming a doctor, Eds.

496
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:44,768
No, I ended up becoming
a risk analyst.

497
00:29:44,835 --> 00:29:46,104
Oh, that sounds
really interesting.

498
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:47,604
What does that entail?

499
00:29:47,671 --> 00:29:50,474
Yeah, so I work for
a big insurance firm and...

500
00:29:59,282 --> 00:30:01,052
Fuck you, dude.
Fuck you.

501
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,587
Was this job
invented before fun?

502
00:30:03,654 --> 00:30:06,356
- That's so not funny.
- It is funny.

503
00:30:06,423 --> 00:30:08,926
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

504
00:30:08,993 --> 00:30:10,794
I propose a toast

505
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:13,797
to the Losers.

506
00:30:19,836 --> 00:30:21,605
Let's take our
shirts off and kiss!

507
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:23,407
Oh!

508
00:30:28,812 --> 00:30:30,247
- Oh, here we go.
- Thank you.

509
00:30:30,313 --> 00:30:31,883
Thank you.

510
00:30:31,949 --> 00:30:35,086
Like, Rogan-Marsh,
half my wife's closet Rogan-Marsh?

511
00:30:35,153 --> 00:30:37,287
That's...
That's huge.

512
00:30:37,354 --> 00:30:40,490
That's our line.
Me and my husband, Tom.

513
00:30:40,557 --> 00:30:41,893
How long have
you been married?

514
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,460
Hey, we saw your movie,

515
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:44,795
- by the way.
- You did?

516
00:30:44,862 --> 00:30:46,363
Oh, my God!
It was so good.

517
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,365
- Oh, my God.
- It was so scary.

518
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:49,733
And the ending sucked?

519
00:30:52,003 --> 00:30:53,770
Yeah, it did.
I'm sorry.

520
00:30:53,837 --> 00:30:54,939
That's all right.

521
00:31:01,012 --> 00:31:02,113
What?

522
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,747
Nothing.
This is just weird.

523
00:31:03,814 --> 00:31:04,815
Yeah.

524
00:31:04,882 --> 00:31:06,550
Just all this,
all these memories,

525
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:09,786
people that I don't even
remember forgetting.

526
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,192
I mean, it's weird, right?

527
00:31:14,257 --> 00:31:16,027
Now that we're all here,

528
00:31:16,094 --> 00:31:19,030
everything just comes back
faster and faster.

529
00:31:19,097 --> 00:31:20,297
I mean, all of it.

530
00:31:21,364 --> 00:31:22,934
Yeah.

531
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,434
Yeah, you know,
when Mike called me, I threw up.

532
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,237
Isn't that weird?
Like, I got nervous.

533
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:28,973
I got, like,
sick and I threw up.

534
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,009
I feel fine now.

535
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:33,844
I feel very relieved to be
here with you guys.

536
00:31:33,911 --> 00:31:35,612
Why is everybody
looking at me like this?

537
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,447
When Mike called me,
I crashed my car.

538
00:31:37,514 --> 00:31:38,582
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

539
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:40,118
Shit, man,
I hear you.

540
00:31:40,184 --> 00:31:42,019
I mean, my heart
was literally

541
00:31:42,086 --> 00:31:44,688
pounding right
out of my chest.

542
00:31:44,755 --> 00:31:46,924
- I thought it was only me.
- It was like pure...

543
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:49,760
Fear.

544
00:31:51,595 --> 00:31:54,598
It's fear.
What you felt.

545
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:58,468
Why did we all
feel like that, Mike?

546
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:01,605
You remember something
we don't, don't you, Mike?

547
00:32:02,974 --> 00:32:06,244
Something happens to you
when you leave this town.

548
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:08,512
The farther away,
the hazier it all gets.

549
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:10,915
But me, I never left.

550
00:32:11,983 --> 00:32:12,984
So, yeah.

551
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:15,853
I remember.

552
00:32:17,188 --> 00:32:19,389
I remember all of it.

553
00:32:22,392 --> 00:32:23,627
Pennywise.

554
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:27,697
Oh, the fucking clown.

555
00:32:27,764 --> 00:32:30,001
- Oh, shit.
- Pennywise.

556
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:32,036
Mike, you said you wanted
our help with something.

557
00:32:32,103 --> 00:32:33,637
What was that?

558
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:35,273
There's an echo
here in Derry

559
00:32:35,338 --> 00:32:36,974
that bounces back
every 27 years.

560
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,109
What are you talking about?

561
00:32:38,176 --> 00:32:39,643
Hold on.
Listen, listen.

562
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,511
We thought
we stopped It back then.

563
00:32:41,578 --> 00:32:43,380
We thought It
was done, but...

564
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:45,649
Mike.

565
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:47,751
A week ago, a man,

566
00:32:47,818 --> 00:32:49,586
Adrian Mellon, slaughtered.

567
00:32:49,653 --> 00:32:52,089
A girl, Lisa Albrecht,
the other night, went missing.

568
00:32:52,156 --> 00:32:53,790
All right.

569
00:32:53,858 --> 00:32:55,392
There've already been others,
and there will be more.

570
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:56,693
I don't want to
hear about this shit.

571
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,963
- More death. More pain.
- Calm down.

572
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,131
Let's get another drink.

573
00:33:00,198 --> 00:33:01,565
Let him explain.
Let him explain.

574
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:03,333
Explain it to us, Mike.

575
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,902
That echo,

576
00:33:06,137 --> 00:33:07,939
we might have changed It,

577
00:33:08,005 --> 00:33:09,240
just like It changed us.

578
00:33:09,307 --> 00:33:11,175
But we didn't stop It.

579
00:33:11,242 --> 00:33:13,343
Because It just bounced back.

580
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:17,915
We made an oath.

581
00:33:17,982 --> 00:33:21,085
That's why I brought you back.
That's why you're here.

582
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,954
To finish It.

583
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,521
For good.

584
00:33:26,556 --> 00:33:28,458
Well, that shit got dark fast.

585
00:33:28,525 --> 00:33:29,726
Thanks, Mike.

586
00:33:33,297 --> 00:33:35,599
My fortune cookie
just says "Could."

587
00:33:37,134 --> 00:33:38,668
They don't know how to do
fortune cookies here.

588
00:33:38,735 --> 00:33:39,904
Mine just says "Guess."

589
00:33:39,971 --> 00:33:43,274
You wanna throw
that over here?

590
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,377
What you got, Mikey?

591
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:53,951
Wait, what?

592
00:33:54,018 --> 00:33:55,619
This is
what I'm talking about.

593
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:58,055
"Guess. Cut.
Not. Could. It."

594
00:33:58,122 --> 00:33:59,589
It's a message.

595
00:33:59,656 --> 00:34:01,524
No,
"Guess it could not cut."

596
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:03,861
Why would it guess
it could not cut?

597
00:34:03,928 --> 00:34:04,996
Cut what?

598
00:34:05,062 --> 00:34:06,463
"Guess
it could not cut."

599
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:08,199
"It" goes in front.
There.

600
00:34:08,266 --> 00:34:09,633
"It could not guess."

601
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:12,069
- It couldn't guess.
- "Could it..."

602
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:13,403
No. "Could it not cut."

603
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,972
When it says "It,"
is it talking about It?

604
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:16,874
- Yeah. All right.
- Is that what it means?

605
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:18,276
- Is "It" It?
- Where does this go?

606
00:34:18,342 --> 00:34:19,377
That's what
I'm talking about.

607
00:34:19,442 --> 00:34:20,810
It... It could...

608
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:22,179
I don't know
what it fucking means!

609
00:34:22,246 --> 00:34:23,713
You fuck with
the fortune cookies, Mike?

610
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,049
- No.
- Whoa. Let him speak, man.

611
00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:27,351
This is not me.
This is what It does.

612
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:29,086
I need my fucking inhaler!

613
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:30,955
What is wrong with you, man?
Why'd you call us?

614
00:34:31,022 --> 00:34:32,422
- This is not fucking funny!
- This is so not funny!

615
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,823
- Beverly?
- This is so not funny.

616
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,821
Why does it say Stanley?

617
00:35:05,957 --> 00:35:08,259
Someone else
fucking answer me!

618
00:35:09,393 --> 00:35:10,694
Holy shit.

619
00:35:12,063 --> 00:35:13,230
Holy shit.

620
00:35:21,372 --> 00:35:23,640
What the fuck
is that, man?

621
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,242
Oh, my God.

622
00:35:27,979 --> 00:35:28,980
Whoa, whoa!

623
00:35:32,749 --> 00:35:34,784
Whoa!

624
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,091
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

625
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:42,226
Shit.

626
00:35:44,295 --> 00:35:45,628
Hey! Hey!

627
00:35:45,695 --> 00:35:48,199
That fortune cookie's
looking at me! Shit!

628
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,636
I don't want to be here.
I can't fucking do this.

629
00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:55,739
I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!

630
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,640
I don't wanna be here!

631
00:35:57,707 --> 00:35:58,641
I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!

632
00:35:58,708 --> 00:35:59,977
Holy shit!

633
00:36:01,644 --> 00:36:02,812
Hey! God damn it.

634
00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:08,953
Hey, Eddie!

635
00:36:26,137 --> 00:36:27,604
Whoa! Fuck!

636
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,040
It's not real!

637
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:32,043
This isn't real!
It's not real!

638
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:35,112
It's not real!
It's not real!

639
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:37,680
It's not real!
It's not real!

640
00:36:37,747 --> 00:36:41,085
It's not real!
It's not real!

641
00:36:41,152 --> 00:36:43,020
Is everything all right?

642
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:47,557
Yeah, yeah.
Could we get the check?

643
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:54,231
That's what
Pennywise does, right?

644
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:55,933
He fucks with us.
So, Stanley's probably fine.

645
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,501
Hey, Mike.
Do you have Stan's number?

646
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:59,103
Yeah.

647
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,337
Hey, Richie.

648
00:37:02,672 --> 00:37:04,175
How'd you...

649
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:05,575
How'd you know my name?

650
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:07,710
The fun's just beginning.

651
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:09,779
Right?

652
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:16,420
What he said, is it...

653
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:18,055
Listen.
You think this is funny?

654
00:37:18,122 --> 00:37:19,190
All right?

655
00:37:19,256 --> 00:37:21,758
Think this is
some sort of game, huh?

656
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,027
Well, fuck you,
all right?

657
00:37:23,094 --> 00:37:24,395
Rich,
be careful, dude.

658
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:26,197
Fuck you!
I'm not afraid of you!

659
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:28,999
"The fun's just beginning."

660
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:31,402
The line from your act, dude.
I'm a fan.

661
00:37:31,469 --> 00:37:34,071
- Are those your parents?
- Yeah.

662
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:36,840
You want a picture?

663
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:39,009
- You okay, Dean? Come on.
- I think I'm good.

664
00:37:39,076 --> 00:37:41,946
Okay, cool.
He's a good kid.

665
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:43,713
Jesus, Richie.
You don't remember a line

666
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,082
from your own show?

667
00:37:45,149 --> 00:37:47,251
I don't write
my own material.

668
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:50,054
I fucking knew it!
I fucking knew it!

669
00:37:50,121 --> 00:37:54,458
Hello, Mrs. Uris.
My name's Beverly Marsh.

670
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:55,758
I apologize for calling,

671
00:37:55,825 --> 00:37:57,627
but I'm an old friend
of your husband's.

672
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:59,296
You lied to us.
That's not okay.

673
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:01,165
Yeah, first words out of your
mouth should have been like,

674
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:03,100
"Hey, man. You want to come
to Derry and get murdered?"

675
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,468
'Cause then
I would have said no.

676
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:05,569
Guys.

677
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:07,338
Fucking entrapment, man.

678
00:38:07,404 --> 00:38:08,506
<i>Oh...</i>

679
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:11,976
<i>He passed.</i>

680
00:38:13,643 --> 00:38:14,844
When did it happen?

681
00:38:15,513 --> 00:38:17,680
<i>Yesterday.</i>

682
00:38:17,747 --> 00:38:20,384
<i>It was horrible,
the way he died.</i>

683
00:38:21,818 --> 00:38:22,987
<i>His wrists.</i>

684
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:25,322
- In the bathtub.
- <i>In the bathtub.</i>

685
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,162
<i>I'm sorry.
I have to go.</i>

686
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:33,763
We're all very
sorry, Patty.

687
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,099
<i>Thank you.</i>

688
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:39,436
Stanley.

689
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:43,307
Pennywise knew.
He knew before we did.

690
00:38:43,374 --> 00:38:45,109
We have to stop him.
I have a plan.

691
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:46,843
I got a plan.
Getting the fuck out of Dodge

692
00:38:46,911 --> 00:38:49,180
before this ends worse
than one of Bill's books.

693
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:50,680
Who's with me?

694
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:51,949
We made a promise
to each other.

695
00:38:52,016 --> 00:38:53,617
Let's un-make the promise.

696
00:38:53,683 --> 00:38:54,985
Richie, other people
are gonna die.

697
00:38:55,052 --> 00:38:57,188
Other people
die every day, man!

698
00:38:57,254 --> 00:38:59,223
We don't owe
this town shit!

699
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,926
Plus, I just remembered I grew up
here, like, two hours ago.

700
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:04,761
So, I'm fucking leaving.
Fuck this.

701
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:07,164
I'm sorry, man,
I'm with Richie.

702
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:08,731
- Eds, please.
- Listen.

703
00:39:08,798 --> 00:39:11,569
What? We stay,
we die, that's it?

704
00:39:11,635 --> 00:39:14,038
I'm gonna go back to the inn,
I'm gonna pack up my shit,

705
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:15,606
and I'm gonna
drive to my home.

706
00:39:15,673 --> 00:39:17,041
I'm sorry, man. Good luck.

707
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:18,876
No, Eddie. Please.
Please, Eddie!

708
00:39:18,943 --> 00:39:20,477
Eddie, wait!

709
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,381
You okay?

710
00:39:26,517 --> 00:39:27,918
I'm gonna head back
to the Town House, too.

711
00:39:27,985 --> 00:39:29,752
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

712
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:33,657
You should have told us,
Mikey.

713
00:39:33,723 --> 00:39:35,893
Bill. Please, man.

714
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,127
I'm begging you.
Please.

715
00:39:37,194 --> 00:39:38,662
Just listen to me, man.
Please.

716
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:40,331
What are you gonna say?

717
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:43,434
What could you possibly say

718
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,602
that would make
any kind of a difference?

719
00:39:44,668 --> 00:39:46,836
They're all gone.

720
00:39:46,904 --> 00:39:49,173
Come on.
Let me show you something.

721
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,775
One thing. And if you want to
leave, you can leave.

722
00:39:52,842 --> 00:39:54,311
Just let me show you
this first. Please.

723
00:40:00,517 --> 00:40:03,687
Lapskew!
What kind of name is that, huh?

724
00:40:03,753 --> 00:40:05,089
My mom swings
better than you!

725
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:06,490
How many times
do I have to...

726
00:40:06,557 --> 00:40:09,293
She doesn't even play
baseball! You suck!

727
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:15,132
Mommy, how much longer?

728
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,035
Victoria,
we came to watch the game.

729
00:40:18,102 --> 00:40:20,204
We're gonna
watch the game.

730
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:21,365
Hello, Vicky.

731
00:41:21,432 --> 00:41:23,701
Isn't that what
your friends call you?

732
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:24,968
Vicky?

733
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,871
How did I know that?

734
00:41:27,938 --> 00:41:31,508
I guess I must be
your friend, too.

735
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:34,511
If you're my friend,
why are you hiding in the dark?

736
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:39,383
You're not my friend.
You're scary.

737
00:41:48,726 --> 00:41:50,260
Why are you crying?

738
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:56,066
People always make fun
'cause of the way I look.

739
00:41:57,668 --> 00:42:01,071
I thought if you
couldn't see my face,

740
00:42:01,138 --> 00:42:04,541
then maybe you'd
want to be my friend.

741
00:42:05,743 --> 00:42:07,511
Never mind.

742
00:42:07,578 --> 00:42:13,150
Oh, silly old Pennywise,
you'll never have no friends.

743
00:42:13,217 --> 00:42:15,052
People make fun
of me, too.

744
00:42:16,653 --> 00:42:17,921
They do?

745
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,024
'Cause of this.

746
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,328
Well, isn't that silly?

747
00:42:25,496 --> 00:42:27,598
That little thing?

748
00:42:27,664 --> 00:42:30,334
Why, I can blow
that thing right away.

749
00:42:31,702 --> 00:42:32,770
You could?

750
00:42:32,836 --> 00:42:34,171
Oh, yes!

751
00:42:34,238 --> 00:42:37,174
One poof and it'd be gone!

752
00:42:40,043 --> 00:42:43,614
You would have to get close
enough to see my face.

753
00:42:44,515 --> 00:42:45,649
I don't know, Vicky.

754
00:42:45,716 --> 00:42:48,452
No, it's okay.
I won't make fun. I promise.

755
00:42:50,387 --> 00:42:51,488
Promise promise?

756
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,925
Well, okie-dokie!

757
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:56,593
Just come on in
a little closer,

758
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,497
and we'll blow it away on
the count of three!

759
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:04,468
One,

760
00:43:06,871 --> 00:43:09,273
two...

761
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

762
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:21,518
You're supposed to say three.

763
00:43:53,984 --> 00:43:55,686
Holy fuck.

764
00:43:57,588 --> 00:43:58,388
Boo!

765
00:44:11,702 --> 00:44:13,303
Fuck yeah!

766
00:44:15,772 --> 00:44:17,274
Hey, Hockstetter.

767
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:19,776
Let's go!

768
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:39,396
Let's get our shit and
get the fuck out of here.

769
00:44:39,463 --> 00:44:40,865
Did you leave
your stuff here?

770
00:44:40,932 --> 00:44:42,232
No, my stuff's
still in the car.

771
00:44:56,881 --> 00:44:59,683
- Tell me.
- Tell you what?

772
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:02,519
Whatever it is you're
afraid to tell me right now.

773
00:45:06,757 --> 00:45:08,458
Bev. Bev.

774
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:09,726
Back at the Jade when you were
on the phone with Stanley's...

775
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:10,794
Stop.

776
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:15,766
She told you that she
found him in the bathtub,

777
00:45:15,832 --> 00:45:17,367
but, Bev, I saw you.

778
00:45:17,434 --> 00:45:20,939
I heard it.
You said it first.

779
00:45:21,005 --> 00:45:22,506
Whatever you guys
are talking about,

780
00:45:22,573 --> 00:45:24,274
let's make it happen faster,
all right? We gotta go.

781
00:45:24,341 --> 00:45:26,476
<i>Eduardo, andale!</i>
Let's go!

782
00:45:26,543 --> 00:45:29,246
There's something
you're not telling us.

783
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:31,515
You knew how Stanley died.
You knew.

784
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:33,851
Wait, what?

785
00:45:34,886 --> 00:45:37,287
I can't do this.

786
00:45:37,354 --> 00:45:38,890
She knew how Stanley
was going to die,

787
00:45:38,957 --> 00:45:40,190
is that what
she just said?

788
00:45:40,257 --> 00:45:42,392
You can't just
walk away from this.

789
00:45:42,459 --> 00:45:43,760
How did you know

790
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:44,828
where he killed himself?

791
00:45:44,896 --> 00:45:46,096
Bev.

792
00:45:47,065 --> 00:45:48,332
Talk to me.

793
00:45:48,398 --> 00:45:50,267
Just talk to me.
Like we used to.

794
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:52,235
Come on,
how did you know?

795
00:45:52,904 --> 00:45:54,338
Because I saw it.

796
00:45:56,007 --> 00:45:58,308
I've seen all of us die.

797
00:45:59,776 --> 00:46:01,079
Okay, I just got to
grab my toiletry bag,

798
00:46:01,144 --> 00:46:02,179
and then we can go.

799
00:46:04,381 --> 00:46:05,582
What'd I miss?

800
00:46:19,796 --> 00:46:21,331
The library?

801
00:46:21,398 --> 00:46:22,766
Mmm-hmm.

802
00:46:25,036 --> 00:46:26,536
Wow.

803
00:46:26,603 --> 00:46:29,206
Didn't this place
used to be bigger?

804
00:46:40,918 --> 00:46:43,620
Yo!
Mike, where are you going?

805
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:11,248
Mike, you live here?

806
00:47:11,314 --> 00:47:13,316
Yeah.
Make yourself at home.

807
00:47:14,785 --> 00:47:16,353
- You want some water?
- Yeah, sure.

808
00:47:30,101 --> 00:47:32,402
You see, memory's the thing.

809
00:47:32,469 --> 00:47:34,005
It's the key.

810
00:47:34,072 --> 00:47:35,572
It's the key
to everything.

811
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:39,409
If It really does want
us back here,

812
00:47:39,476 --> 00:47:40,677
don't you think the
smartest thing we can do

813
00:47:40,744 --> 00:47:42,146
is just get the hell
out of Derry?

814
00:47:42,212 --> 00:47:44,781
No, no, no.
It does want us back.

815
00:47:44,848 --> 00:47:45,950
Of course It does!

816
00:47:46,017 --> 00:47:47,350
But It doesn't know
I know what I know.

817
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:48,552
What do you know?

818
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:49,921
How to kill the shit
out of It!

819
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:52,890
I've read every book.

820
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:55,492
I've talked to every person
in this godforsaken town,

821
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:57,161
everybody that would talk to
me, anyway,

822
00:47:57,227 --> 00:47:59,362
and that's not a long list.

823
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:00,664
But it wasn't enough.

824
00:48:00,731 --> 00:48:02,967
I had to know
how this all started.

825
00:48:03,034 --> 00:48:05,736
How It started.

826
00:48:10,273 --> 00:48:11,976
And It started

827
00:48:14,145 --> 00:48:17,115
- here.
- Whoa.

828
00:48:17,181 --> 00:48:20,317
- What am I looking at, Mike?
- It's an artifact.

829
00:48:20,383 --> 00:48:22,719
Early 18th century Shokopiwah.

830
00:48:22,786 --> 00:48:25,189
Shoko...
How'd you get it?

831
00:48:25,255 --> 00:48:26,757
I found it, in the...

832
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:29,227
No, no,
they gave it to me.

833
00:48:29,292 --> 00:48:30,360
I stole it.

834
00:48:30,427 --> 00:48:32,395
You stole it?

835
00:48:32,462 --> 00:48:34,698
- From Native Americans?
- Uh...

836
00:48:34,765 --> 00:48:38,069
- It's complicated.
- Yeah, it is.

837
00:48:38,136 --> 00:48:39,469
They helped me
on my journey.

838
00:48:39,536 --> 00:48:41,304
So beautiful.

839
00:48:41,371 --> 00:48:44,541
They showed me things.
A vision.

840
00:48:44,608 --> 00:48:46,177
Ow.

841
00:48:46,244 --> 00:48:47,611
Holy fuck.

842
00:48:47,677 --> 00:48:49,713
I feel kind of funky.

843
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,847
Hot.

844
00:48:50,915 --> 00:48:52,016
Am I sweating?

845
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:54,218
I need you to see
what they showed me, Bill.

846
00:48:54,284 --> 00:48:55,619
Bill.

847
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:01,391
They live outside of Derry.

848
00:49:01,458 --> 00:49:03,527
<i>Beyond It's reach.</i>

849
00:49:03,593 --> 00:49:05,796
<i>They moved there
many years ago.</i>

850
00:49:06,596 --> 00:49:08,465
<i>Their holy man,</i>

851
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:10,868
<i>their holy of holies,</i>

852
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:13,237
<i>he took me in.</i>

853
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:17,041
<i>Fed me their sacred Maturin.</i>

854
00:49:18,341 --> 00:49:20,978
<i>I started to...
To react.</i>

855
00:49:21,045 --> 00:49:24,081
All living things
must abide by the laws

856
00:49:24,148 --> 00:49:25,715
of the shape they inhabit.

857
00:49:31,289 --> 00:49:33,891
<i>While I sat there,
looking out over the valley,</i>

858
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:36,060
<i>I saw It arrive.</i>

859
00:49:40,231 --> 00:49:43,834
I knew that one day,
I would have to make you all see.

860
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:44,902
Mike,

861
00:49:47,305 --> 00:49:49,040
did you put something
in my drink?

862
00:49:50,507 --> 00:49:52,043
It's, uh...

863
00:49:52,109 --> 00:49:53,277
It's a root.

864
00:49:53,343 --> 00:49:54,678
You...

865
00:49:54,744 --> 00:49:55,880
You drugged me?
You drugged me?

866
00:49:55,947 --> 00:49:57,781
No, it's a root
with properties.

867
00:49:57,848 --> 00:49:59,951
It's just a micro-dose of
what the Shokopiwah gave me...

868
00:50:00,017 --> 00:50:01,085
Why would you do that?

869
00:50:01,152 --> 00:50:02,987
...to open my eyes.

870
00:50:03,054 --> 00:50:04,654
I don't feel real good.

871
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:07,892
I need you to look,

872
00:50:07,959 --> 00:50:09,093
and you'll see.

873
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,062
I don't feel good.

874
00:50:11,128 --> 00:50:12,529
Open your eyes.

875
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:14,431
Open your eyes.

876
00:50:14,497 --> 00:50:16,700
<i>They showed me the past.</i>

877
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,010
<i>Showed me the way
It appeared to them.</i>

878
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:40,324
<i>They showed me
their pain.</i>

879
00:50:43,928 --> 00:50:46,529
<i>They showed me
how to stop It!</i>

880
00:50:56,439 --> 00:50:57,641
It's over.

881
00:50:57,707 --> 00:50:59,210
It's over.
You're okay.

882
00:50:59,277 --> 00:51:02,313
You're okay.
Did you see it?

883
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,680
The ritual?

884
00:51:03,747 --> 00:51:05,448
- The Ritual of Chud?
- Yeah, I knew you...

885
00:51:05,515 --> 00:51:08,085
I knew you would see it.

886
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:11,289
I saw the whole fucking
thing, Mike.

887
00:51:11,355 --> 00:51:13,657
That's how we kill It.

888
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:21,933
How are we going
to do it?

889
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:25,403
Everybody already
said no.

890
00:51:25,468 --> 00:51:27,171
But with you,

891
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,641
they'll listen.

892
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:34,611
This won't work
without all of us.

893
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:40,817
Okay. So, what do you mean
that you've seen us all die?

894
00:51:40,885 --> 00:51:42,286
Yeah,
'cause I gotta be honest.

895
00:51:42,353 --> 00:51:43,854
That's a fucked-up thing
to just drop on somebody.

896
00:51:45,323 --> 00:51:47,158
Every night since Derry,

897
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:50,995
I've been having
these nightmares.

898
00:51:52,595 --> 00:51:55,699
People in pain.
People dying.

899
00:51:56,167 --> 00:51:57,268
People...

900
00:51:57,335 --> 00:51:58,702
So, you have nightmares.

901
00:51:58,768 --> 00:52:00,237
I have nightmares.
People, they have nightmares.

902
00:52:00,304 --> 00:52:02,974
But that doesn't mean
that your visions are true.

903
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:08,778
I've watched
every single one of us...

904
00:52:08,845 --> 00:52:11,048
You've seen
every single one of us what?

905
00:52:15,853 --> 00:52:18,122
At the place that
Stanley wound up.

906
00:52:20,191 --> 00:52:22,393
That's how we end.

907
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,162
Okay, how come the rest of
us aren't seeing that shit?

908
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:26,696
I mean,
what makes her so different?

909
00:52:26,763 --> 00:52:27,965
The Deadlights.

910
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,701
The Deadlights.

911
00:52:44,882 --> 00:52:46,150
She was the only
one of us

912
00:52:46,217 --> 00:52:48,551
that got caught in
the Deadlights that day.

913
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:51,222
We were all
touched by It.

914
00:52:51,288 --> 00:52:52,722
Changed.

915
00:52:52,789 --> 00:52:56,626
Deep down. Like an infection.
Or a virus.

916
00:52:56,693 --> 00:52:59,030
A virus.
You understand.

917
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:00,364
Slowly growing.

918
00:53:00,431 --> 00:53:03,700
That virus,
it's been growing for 27 years.

919
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:05,835
This whole time,
metastasizing.

920
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:07,304
It just got to Stan
first, because...

921
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:08,506
He was the weakest.

922
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:10,074
Jesus Christ, Rich.

923
00:53:10,141 --> 00:53:11,976
Just saying what everyone
else is thinking, man.

924
00:53:12,043 --> 00:53:13,477
I mean,
Rich, come on.

925
00:53:13,543 --> 00:53:16,380
What Beverly sees,
it will come to pass.

926
00:53:16,447 --> 00:53:18,315
It's what'll happen to
all of us, eventually,

927
00:53:18,382 --> 00:53:19,682
unless we stop It.

928
00:53:19,749 --> 00:53:21,252
How the hell are we
supposed to do that?

929
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:23,653
The Ritual of Chud.

930
00:53:25,256 --> 00:53:26,823
The Shokopiwah.

931
00:53:26,891 --> 00:53:30,094
The first ones who fought
It, they have a saying.

932
00:53:30,161 --> 00:53:32,096
"All living things
must abide by

933
00:53:32,163 --> 00:53:33,497
"the laws of the
shape they inhabit."

934
00:53:33,563 --> 00:53:34,865
A tribal ritual?

935
00:53:36,699 --> 00:53:38,069
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

936
00:53:38,135 --> 00:53:39,870
All right,
there's gotta be another way.

937
00:53:39,937 --> 00:53:41,972
Okay? This thing comes
back, what, every 27 years?

938
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:44,008
Let's just kick the can down
the road and do it then.

939
00:53:44,075 --> 00:53:45,708
Wait, we'll be 70 years
old, asshole.

940
00:53:45,775 --> 00:53:47,577
It doesn't
work that way.

941
00:53:48,913 --> 00:53:50,713
None of us make it
another 20 years,

942
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:53,150
and the way it happens...

943
00:53:55,453 --> 00:53:58,389
So, if we don't beat It
this cycle, then...

944
00:53:58,456 --> 00:53:59,924
We die.

945
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,058
Horribly.

946
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:02,860
Yeah, I don't need
the "horribly" part.

947
00:54:02,927 --> 00:54:04,594
I didn't say it.
She said it. Not me.

948
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:05,996
All right, guys.
Look.

949
00:54:06,063 --> 00:54:08,866
I've seen
what he's talking about,

950
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:12,036
and it's all true.

951
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:14,771
It's the only way.

952
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:17,807
If we want
this ritual to work...

953
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:19,210
We have to remember.

954
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,047
Remember what?

955
00:54:27,885 --> 00:54:29,719
<i>It's better
if I show you.</i>

956
00:54:30,988 --> 00:54:32,755
<i>We don't have
much time.</i>

957
00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:36,693
<i>His cycle
will end soon.</i>

958
00:54:38,562 --> 00:54:39,864
<i>And once it does...</i>

959
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:41,198
<i>We're fucked.</i>

960
00:55:03,921 --> 00:55:05,722
The Barrens.

961
00:55:05,788 --> 00:55:07,424
This is where we came.

962
00:55:08,459 --> 00:55:10,161
After the rock fight.

963
00:55:11,495 --> 00:55:12,695
The clubhouse.

964
00:55:13,497 --> 00:55:15,132
You built that for us.

965
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,634
Yeah, the hatch has got to
be around here someplace.

966
00:55:16,699 --> 00:55:18,602
You did.
I do remember that!

967
00:55:18,668 --> 00:55:20,237
- Oh!
- Whoa! Whoa!

968
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:23,007
You okay?

969
00:55:26,143 --> 00:55:27,744
- What?
- Nothing, it's just...

970
00:55:28,946 --> 00:55:30,281
You haven't changed.

971
00:55:31,348 --> 00:55:32,550
It's a good thing.

972
00:55:37,154 --> 00:55:39,890
You know what?
I actually think the door was more like

973
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:42,193
around...

974
00:55:48,465 --> 00:55:49,699
Found it.

975
00:55:50,401 --> 00:55:51,468
I'm okay!

976
00:55:52,203 --> 00:55:53,270
Come down!

977
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:11,788
What the dick is this?

978
00:56:11,855 --> 00:56:13,224
How'd you build it?

979
00:56:14,391 --> 00:56:16,193
When did you build it?

980
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,362
Here and there,
I guess.

981
00:56:18,429 --> 00:56:19,863
It was already dug
out from something,

982
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:22,199
so I just had to
reinforce the walls

983
00:56:22,266 --> 00:56:23,901
and get some wood
for the roof door,

984
00:56:23,968 --> 00:56:25,703
and that's pretty much it.

985
00:56:25,768 --> 00:56:27,770
Pretty good for
my first time, huh?

986
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,808
Now,
that's a cool feature.

987
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:33,010
What happens when
you put your hand

988
00:56:33,077 --> 00:56:34,811
on the other pillar,
professor?

989
00:56:34,878 --> 00:56:37,014
Okay, you see, this is exactly
why there are safety codes,

990
00:56:37,081 --> 00:56:38,549
why we have permits.

991
00:56:38,616 --> 00:56:40,217
This place is a death trap.
You understand that?

992
00:56:40,284 --> 00:56:41,952
Well, it's a work in progress.
Okay, Eddie?

993
00:56:42,019 --> 00:56:43,587
Just so you know, I get
hurt, you are liable.

994
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:45,589
And, also, what is this?
The switch of an iron maiden?

995
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:46,756
That's a flashlight.

996
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:47,992
What is that,
a horse hitch?

997
00:56:48,058 --> 00:56:49,493
When do you have
horses down...

998
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,728
Oh, this is cool.

999
00:56:50,793 --> 00:56:52,029
That was like,
three dollars,

1000
00:56:52,096 --> 00:56:53,597
so be careful with that, please.

1001
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:55,165
I have one of these.
Hey, Stan, you see this?

1002
00:56:55,232 --> 00:56:56,867
Yeah, okay,
can you maybe not?

1003
00:56:56,934 --> 00:56:58,569
Maybe not what? Yeah, yeah, hold on.
Maybe not what?

1004
00:56:58,636 --> 00:57:00,004
Be awesome and have fun

1005
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:01,905
and celebrate the magic
of the paddle-ball?

1006
00:57:02,772 --> 00:57:04,241
Wow.

1007
00:57:04,308 --> 00:57:06,043
Oh, good going, fucknut.
You broke his thing.

1008
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,211
- I broke it?
- Yeah,

1009
00:57:07,278 --> 00:57:08,545
you broke it
with your face.

1010
00:57:08,612 --> 00:57:10,347
What?

1011
00:57:10,414 --> 00:57:11,949
I'm not putting
my fucking hand down there.

1012
00:57:19,056 --> 00:57:20,491
Oh, man.
That's so cool.

1013
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,494
Oh, my God.

1014
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,964
How do we all not
remember that this was here?

1015
00:57:27,031 --> 00:57:28,932
Hey, Losers.

1016
00:57:31,368 --> 00:57:33,237
Time to float.

1017
00:57:38,042 --> 00:57:40,010
- Ahh!
- Fuck, Richie.

1018
00:57:40,077 --> 00:57:41,645
- Dude!
- Remember when he used to say

1019
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:44,248
that shit?
And he'd do that little dance.

1020
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,352
Am I the only one
who remembers this shit?

1021
00:57:48,419 --> 00:57:51,488
Are you gonna be like this
the entire time we're home?

1022
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:53,724
All right. Just trying to
add some levity to this shit.

1023
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:55,426
I'll go fuck myself.

1024
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:59,296
It smells so fucking
terrible in here.

1025
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,535
Hey, you guys?

1026
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:09,406
This says "Stan."

1027
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:12,443
"For the use
of Losers only."

1028
00:58:14,978 --> 00:58:16,180
Bill.

1029
00:58:25,255 --> 00:58:27,024
The fuck is this?

1030
00:58:27,091 --> 00:58:28,292
So you don't get
spiders stuck

1031
00:58:28,359 --> 00:58:29,893
in your hair
when you're down here.

1032
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,028
Stanley, we're not afraid
of fucking spiders.

1033
00:58:34,665 --> 00:58:35,999
I stand corrected.

1034
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:38,135
That's a first.

1035
00:58:38,635 --> 00:58:40,237
Touche.

1036
00:58:40,304 --> 00:58:41,905
Hey, Rich,
your ten minutes are up.

1037
00:58:41,972 --> 00:58:43,374
What are you talking about?

1038
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,075
The hammock.
Ten minutes each was the rule.

1039
00:58:45,142 --> 00:58:46,543
- I don't see any sign.
- Are you

1040
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:48,379
being this way right now?
Really? No, no, no.

1041
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:50,180
Why would there be a sign if
it was a verbal agreement?

1042
00:58:50,247 --> 00:58:53,083
And I remember you agreeing
on the fucking rule!

1043
00:58:54,651 --> 00:58:55,953
I can see your vagina!

1044
00:58:56,019 --> 00:58:57,588
Ten minutes each.

1045
00:58:57,654 --> 00:58:59,323
Go back in
your dumb little corner!

1046
00:59:00,023 --> 00:59:01,558
I fucked your mom!

1047
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:04,461
No, you didn't.
Take that back!

1048
00:59:04,528 --> 00:59:06,530
You're awfully good at
this, new kid.

1049
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:08,966
You really think so?

1050
00:59:10,334 --> 00:59:12,503
There's actually a summer
program in Bar Harbor.

1051
00:59:12,569 --> 00:59:14,338
Teaches you, like,
everything about architecture.

1052
00:59:14,405 --> 00:59:15,639
I was thinking about applying.

1053
00:59:15,706 --> 00:59:17,174
I'll do that.

1054
00:59:17,241 --> 00:59:20,043
I'll do anything to get
the hell out of Derry.

1055
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:22,179
Man, when I graduate,
I'm going to Florida.

1056
00:59:22,246 --> 00:59:24,047
What's in Florida, Mike?

1057
00:59:25,115 --> 00:59:26,717
I don't know.

1058
00:59:26,784 --> 00:59:28,519
You know, I guess it's just a
place I always wanted to go.

1059
00:59:28,585 --> 00:59:30,654
Stan, you should go
with Mike to Florida.

1060
00:59:30,721 --> 00:59:32,256
You already act 80.

1061
00:59:32,322 --> 00:59:33,858
You'd clean up with all the grandmas.

1062
00:59:37,428 --> 00:59:39,563
Do you guys think
we'll still be friends?

1063
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:43,167
When we're older?

1064
00:59:43,233 --> 00:59:45,502
What?

1065
00:59:45,569 --> 00:59:47,938
Why wouldn't we be?

1066
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:49,206
Do any of your parents
still hang out

1067
00:59:49,273 --> 00:59:50,507
with their friends
from middle school?

1068
00:59:52,075 --> 00:59:55,045
I mean, things might
be different then.

1069
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,115
We all might be different.

1070
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:02,786
We'll always still be friends.

1071
01:00:02,854 --> 01:00:05,122
I don't think that just,
you know,

1072
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:07,324
goes away
because we get older.

1073
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:10,594
Yeah, Stan. Come on.

1074
01:00:13,063 --> 01:00:15,732
You don't have
to be so...

1075
01:00:15,799 --> 01:00:17,201
Sad.

1076
01:00:21,171 --> 01:00:23,474
He was old
before his time.

1077
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,509
Yeah.

1078
01:00:25,576 --> 01:00:28,245
I wonder what he was
like all grown up.

1079
01:00:28,312 --> 01:00:30,247
Probably what he
was like as a kid.

1080
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:34,751
The best.

1081
01:00:36,053 --> 01:00:37,287
Here.

1082
01:00:38,822 --> 01:00:41,191
All right, Mike.
What are we doing here?

1083
01:00:42,493 --> 01:00:43,627
The ritual.

1084
01:00:43,694 --> 01:00:46,129
To perform it
requires a sacrifice.

1085
01:00:46,196 --> 01:00:48,765
- Sacrifice? I nominate Eddie.
- Wait, what?

1086
01:00:48,832 --> 01:00:50,767
Because you're little.
You'll fit on a barbeque.

1087
01:00:50,834 --> 01:00:53,070
I'm 5'9". It's, like,
average height in most of the world.

1088
01:00:53,136 --> 01:00:55,639
It's not that kind of
a sacrifice, guys.

1089
01:00:56,607 --> 01:00:57,741
Mike?

1090
01:00:58,709 --> 01:01:00,444
The past is buried.

1091
01:01:00,511 --> 01:01:02,713
But you're gonna have
to dig it up.

1092
01:01:02,779 --> 01:01:04,781
Piece by piece.

1093
01:01:04,848 --> 01:01:06,116
And these pieces,

1094
01:01:06,183 --> 01:01:07,784
these artifacts,

1095
01:01:08,887 --> 01:01:10,387
that's why we're here.

1096
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:14,057
They are
what you'll sacrifice.

1097
01:01:15,392 --> 01:01:17,594
And since Stan
isn't here to find his...

1098
01:01:17,661 --> 01:01:19,663
I figured we should
all be here together

1099
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:21,265
to find his artifact.

1100
01:01:23,868 --> 01:01:25,536
I think Bill just did that.

1101
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:32,643
Okay, Mike, so where
do we find our tokens?

1102
01:01:32,709 --> 01:01:34,411
Yeah, I gotta be honest, man.
All due respect.

1103
01:01:34,478 --> 01:01:36,647
This is fucking stupid,
all right?

1104
01:01:36,713 --> 01:01:38,282
Why do we need tokens?
All right?

1105
01:01:38,348 --> 01:01:39,884
We already remember
everything.

1106
01:01:39,951 --> 01:01:41,184
Saving Bev,
defeating It...

1107
01:01:41,251 --> 01:01:43,153
I mean,
we're caught up!

1108
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,555
It's not everything.

1109
01:01:46,156 --> 01:01:48,258
We fought.
But what happened after that?

1110
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:51,295
Before the house
on Neibolt.

1111
01:01:52,596 --> 01:01:53,697
Think.

1112
01:01:55,732 --> 01:01:58,702
We can't
remember, can we?

1113
01:01:58,769 --> 01:02:00,804
See, there's more to our story.

1114
01:02:00,872 --> 01:02:02,239
What happened that summer.

1115
01:02:03,173 --> 01:02:04,876
And those blank spaces,

1116
01:02:04,943 --> 01:02:07,077
like pages torn out of a book.

1117
01:02:07,144 --> 01:02:09,613
That's what
you need to find.

1118
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,381
We need to split up.

1119
01:02:11,448 --> 01:02:13,750
You each need to
find your artifact.

1120
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:15,719
Alone.
That's important.

1121
01:02:15,786 --> 01:02:16,787
When you do,

1122
01:02:18,121 --> 01:02:19,590
meet me
at the library tonight.

1123
01:02:19,656 --> 01:02:21,525
Yeah,
I gotta say,

1124
01:02:21,592 --> 01:02:23,293
statistically speaking,
you look at survival scenarios,

1125
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,029
we're gonna do much
better as a group.

1126
01:02:25,095 --> 01:02:26,830
Yeah, splitting up
would be dumb, man.

1127
01:02:26,898 --> 01:02:28,732
Okay, we gotta go together.
All right?

1128
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:30,767
We were together that
summer, right?

1129
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:33,270
No.

1130
01:02:33,337 --> 01:02:37,075
Not that
whole summer.

1131
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:38,675
Take it back.

1132
01:02:38,742 --> 01:02:40,243
Bill!

1133
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:43,413
You're just
a bunch of losers.

1134
01:02:44,015 --> 01:02:45,115
Fuck off!

1135
01:02:45,182 --> 01:02:46,717
- Fucking...
- Stop!

1136
01:02:48,485 --> 01:02:51,188
We were all together
when we hurt It.

1137
01:02:51,254 --> 01:02:53,423
That's why
we're still alive.

1138
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:56,193
Yeah? Well,
I plan to keep it that way.

1139
01:03:05,302 --> 01:03:06,370
I bet by tomorrow,

1140
01:03:06,436 --> 01:03:07,738
we'll all be
back together.

1141
01:03:10,273 --> 01:03:11,775
I don't think so.

1142
01:03:11,842 --> 01:03:13,911
Well, if we're gonna stop
It, we better be.

1143
01:03:15,846 --> 01:03:17,347
Maybe Richie was right.

1144
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:22,686
Maybe we shouldn't do anything about
It, or maybe we can't.

1145
01:03:22,753 --> 01:03:25,089
Okay, don't let them
get to you.

1146
01:03:25,155 --> 01:03:26,858
It's a little late
for that.

1147
01:03:30,794 --> 01:03:32,229
You should go.

1148
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:35,666
Before your dad sees.

1149
01:04:10,233 --> 01:04:11,435
Yes?

1150
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:14,271
Sorry. I...

1151
01:04:15,806 --> 01:04:17,841
May I help you?

1152
01:04:17,909 --> 01:04:19,209
I thought I rang Marsh.

1153
01:04:19,276 --> 01:04:21,211
Marsh?

1154
01:04:21,879 --> 01:04:23,346
Alvin Marsh?

1155
01:04:23,881 --> 01:04:25,348
My father.

1156
01:04:26,084 --> 01:04:27,784
I grew up here.

1157
01:04:34,257 --> 01:04:35,625
Dear,

1158
01:04:35,692 --> 01:04:39,163
it's not for me to
tell you this,

1159
01:04:39,229 --> 01:04:41,565
but your father
passed away.

1160
01:04:43,067 --> 01:04:46,336
I'm so sorry.
You didn't know?

1161
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:52,076
We hadn't spoken
in a while.

1162
01:04:52,143 --> 01:04:54,277
Well, won't you
come in?

1163
01:04:54,344 --> 01:04:56,379
Let me offer you
something to drink.

1164
01:04:56,446 --> 01:04:59,382
No, it's fine.
I have to go.

1165
01:04:59,449 --> 01:05:01,953
It's the least
I can do.

1166
01:05:04,488 --> 01:05:06,289
Sure. Okay.

1167
01:05:18,268 --> 01:05:20,804
Is it like you remember?

1168
01:05:20,872 --> 01:05:22,639
Cleaner.

1169
01:05:22,706 --> 01:05:24,876
Well, you feel free
to look around

1170
01:05:24,942 --> 01:05:26,777
while I get
the water boiling.

1171
01:05:26,843 --> 01:05:28,478
Oh, really, it's fine.
You don't need to do that.

1172
01:05:28,545 --> 01:05:31,348
Don't be so polite.

1173
01:05:59,609 --> 01:06:01,411
Today is her birthday.

1174
01:06:05,582 --> 01:06:07,450
I can still smell
her perfume.

1175
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:13,057
And she'd still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

1176
01:06:15,126 --> 01:06:16,660
Mama was sick.

1177
01:06:16,726 --> 01:06:20,330
You know that's why
she did what she did.

1178
01:06:20,397 --> 01:06:22,566
She did what she did

1179
01:06:22,632 --> 01:06:26,736
because she was embarrassed
to be your mother.

1180
01:06:28,438 --> 01:06:29,907
You look like her.

1181
01:06:32,576 --> 01:06:35,046
But you are nothing
like her.

1182
01:06:37,882 --> 01:06:39,382
Come here.

1183
01:06:41,919 --> 01:06:43,855
I said come here!

1184
01:06:46,556 --> 01:06:47,959
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

1185
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:06,443
You know that I
would never hurt you.

1186
01:07:06,509 --> 01:07:07,777
You know that,
don't you?

1187
01:07:17,554 --> 01:07:20,057
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1188
01:07:20,124 --> 01:07:23,426
You'll always be my little
girl, won't you?

1189
01:07:24,128 --> 01:07:25,595
Always.

1190
01:08:35,632 --> 01:08:37,969
"Your hair is winter fire,

1191
01:08:38,768 --> 01:08:41,538
"January embers...

1192
01:08:41,604 --> 01:08:44,175
<i>"My heart burns
there, too."</i>

1193
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:04,028
There. I do apologize.

1194
01:09:04,095 --> 01:09:09,433
It gets so very hot
here this time of year.

1195
01:09:09,499 --> 01:09:10,968
It's fine.

1196
01:09:11,035 --> 01:09:14,872
Well, you feel like you
could just about die.

1197
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:18,042
But you know what
they say about Derry.

1198
01:09:18,109 --> 01:09:22,246
"No one who dies here
ever really dies."

1199
01:09:34,824 --> 01:09:38,295
But tell me,
how is it being back in Derry?

1200
01:09:40,498 --> 01:09:42,466
It's good.
Strange.

1201
01:09:42,532 --> 01:09:44,402
Strange?

1202
01:09:44,468 --> 01:09:45,735
Oh, my.

1203
01:09:45,802 --> 01:09:48,205
Strange, how?

1204
01:09:49,907 --> 01:09:51,976
Oh.

1205
01:09:52,043 --> 01:09:55,146
I had some cookies in
the oven before you came.

1206
01:09:55,212 --> 01:09:56,546
You stay right there.

1207
01:09:56,613 --> 01:09:58,782
I really... I shouldn't impose...
I'm gonna...

1208
01:09:58,848 --> 01:10:01,618
No, no, no. I insist.

1209
01:10:06,924 --> 01:10:09,126
Mrs. Kersh,
are these your family?

1210
01:10:09,193 --> 01:10:10,660
Yes, dear.

1211
01:10:10,727 --> 01:10:14,731
My father came to this country
with $14 in his pocket.

1212
01:10:14,798 --> 01:10:17,034
And he didn't ask
for a handout

1213
01:10:17,101 --> 01:10:19,803
the way that people
come in here these days.

1214
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:21,472
You know what he did?

1215
01:10:21,539 --> 01:10:23,640
What did he do,
Mrs. Kersh?

1216
01:10:23,706 --> 01:10:26,743
My father joined the circus.

1217
01:10:44,061 --> 01:10:47,164
I was always
Daddy's little girl.

1218
01:10:48,299 --> 01:10:49,366
What about you?

1219
01:10:53,237 --> 01:10:56,840
Are you still
his little girl, Beverly?

1220
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Are you?

1221
01:11:13,991 --> 01:11:15,960
Mustn't lie
to our father!

1222
01:11:22,366 --> 01:11:23,666
Help!

1223
01:11:23,733 --> 01:11:27,004
Run, run, run.

1224
01:11:27,438 --> 01:11:29,672
Run, run.

1225
01:11:31,909 --> 01:11:36,113
You haven't
changed anything yet.

1226
01:11:38,815 --> 01:11:43,020
You haven't
changed their futures.

1227
01:11:45,923 --> 01:11:50,793
You... You haven't
saved any of them.

1228
01:11:54,731 --> 01:11:56,799
Close your eyes, Bev.

1229
01:11:57,368 --> 01:11:58,435
Fuck you!

1230
01:11:58,502 --> 01:12:00,703
If you don't believe,

1231
01:12:03,507 --> 01:12:05,209
close them

1232
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:08,112
and see!

1233
01:13:08,038 --> 01:13:09,506
Come on, you.
Come on.

1234
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:13,277
Ken,
you little bitch...

1235
01:13:13,344 --> 01:13:14,378
Yes!

1236
01:13:14,445 --> 01:13:15,613
You're fucking good.

1237
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:17,780
<i>Game over.</i>

1238
01:13:20,084 --> 01:13:22,286
- Ah, well, I gotta go.
- Hey!

1239
01:13:22,785 --> 01:13:24,054
Um...

1240
01:13:26,457 --> 01:13:28,192
How about we
go again?

1241
01:13:28,259 --> 01:13:29,727
Play some more,
you know?

1242
01:13:29,792 --> 01:13:31,295
Fuck you, man.

1243
01:13:31,362 --> 01:13:32,396
Only if you want to.

1244
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:39,203
Dude, why are you
being weird?

1245
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:40,938
I'm not
your fucking boyfriend.

1246
01:13:41,005 --> 01:13:42,839
Whoa, I...
I didn't...

1247
01:13:42,906 --> 01:13:44,774
What the fuck's
going on here?

1248
01:13:44,841 --> 01:13:46,076
You assholes
didn't tell me

1249
01:13:46,143 --> 01:13:47,878
your town is
full of little fairies.

1250
01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:49,446
Richie fucking Tozier?

1251
01:13:49,513 --> 01:13:52,283
What? You're trying to
bone my little cousin?

1252
01:13:54,351 --> 01:13:56,053
Get the fuck out of
here, faggot!

1253
01:14:00,391 --> 01:14:01,892
Fucking move!

1255
01:14:24,847 --> 01:14:26,383
Want a kiss, Richie?

1256
01:14:57,548 --> 01:14:59,516
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

1257
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:01,819
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

1258
01:15:01,885 --> 01:15:04,621
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

1259
01:15:13,464 --> 01:15:16,233
I think I just shit
my pants.

1260
01:15:30,347 --> 01:15:31,515
- Canal Days Festival.
- Shit.

1261
01:15:31,582 --> 01:15:33,317
Closing performance
is tonight.

1262
01:15:33,384 --> 01:15:35,352
Hope to see you there, handsome.

1263
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:43,660
Did you miss
me, Richie?

1264
01:15:43,727 --> 01:15:45,329
Oh, fuck!

1265
01:15:48,867 --> 01:15:51,135
'Cause I've missed you.

1266
01:15:52,336 --> 01:15:56,875
No one wants to play
with the clown anymore.

1267
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:59,276
Play a game with me,
would ya?

1268
01:15:59,343 --> 01:16:00,677
How about <i>Street Fighter?</i>

1269
01:16:00,744 --> 01:16:03,013
Oh, yes.
You like that one, don't you?

1270
01:16:05,716 --> 01:16:09,386
Or maybe
Truth or Dare?

1271
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,121
Jesus.

1272
01:16:11,188 --> 01:16:13,123
Oh, you wouldn't want

1273
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:16,727
anyone to pick "truth,"
though, would ya, Richie?

1274
01:16:16,794 --> 01:16:21,698
You wouldn't want anyone
to know what you're hiding.

Should I

This isn't happening.
This isn't real.
It isn't real. It isn't happening.
It isn't real.

Sorry.

Oh, man!

1286
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:40,544
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

1287
01:17:40,611 --> 01:17:43,413
Yeah, I want to see about the...

1288

The bowling ball?

No, the...

1291
01:17:49,486 --> 01:17:51,722
Banjo?

01:17:51,788 --> 01:17:53,690
Beaver?

01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:55,359
Fucking bike.

1294
01:17:55,425 --> 01:17:58,095
You wanna use
that kind of language,

1295
01:17:59,964 --> 01:18:01,598
take it out
in the street.

1296
01:18:01,665 --> 01:18:03,166
I'm sorry.

1297
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:05,602
Can we just start over and
pretend that I just walked in?

1298
01:18:07,037 --> 01:18:08,405
How can I help you?

1299
01:18:08,472 --> 01:18:11,141
Thank you. Yes.
I want to buy the bike.

1300
01:18:11,208 --> 01:18:13,510
Aren't you William
Denbrough, the writer?

1301
01:18:13,577 --> 01:18:14,946
Yeah, that's...

1302
01:18:15,013 --> 01:18:16,246
That's me.

1303
01:18:16,313 --> 01:18:19,216
That bike
used to be mine.

1304
01:18:19,283 --> 01:18:22,786
Well, it's mine now.

1305
01:18:22,854 --> 01:18:24,054
But you're
the big author.

1306
01:18:24,121 --> 01:18:25,622
You want it,
you can afford it.

1307
01:18:26,858 --> 01:18:28,725
All right.
How much?

1308
01:18:32,796 --> 01:18:33,797
$300.

1309
01:18:35,332 --> 01:18:36,767
You can afford it.

1310
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:39,037
I'll get it.

1311
01:18:39,102 --> 01:18:41,772
I guess
that's kind of a deal.

1312
01:18:52,249 --> 01:18:53,952
You... You want me to
sign it for you?

1313
01:18:54,018 --> 01:18:55,085
Nah.

1314
01:18:55,152 --> 01:18:56,753
I didn't like the ending.

1315
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:01,325
Uh...

1316
01:19:02,225 --> 01:19:03,928
Three big ones.

1317
01:19:03,995 --> 01:19:05,696
- All yours.
- Uh-huh.

1318
01:19:05,762 --> 01:19:07,798
I don't know
how fast she'll go.

1319
01:19:08,632 --> 01:19:10,601
Been there
a lot of years.

1320
01:19:11,768 --> 01:19:13,737
You know what,
mister?

1321
01:19:14,771 --> 01:19:17,240
She was fast enough
to beat the devil.

1322
01:19:24,715 --> 01:19:25,782
Come on.

1323
01:19:32,623 --> 01:19:34,625
Yeah,
I missed you, too.

1324
01:19:41,899 --> 01:19:43,200
Yeah!

1325
01:19:43,667 --> 01:19:44,768
Whoo!

1326
01:19:54,012 --> 01:19:56,513
Hi-ho, Silver!

1327
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:58,448
Away!

1328
01:20:21,171 --> 01:20:22,839
Bye, Billy!

1329
01:20:55,073 --> 01:20:56,373
I know you're
down there.

1330
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,842
I know you
can hear me.

1331
01:21:00,878 --> 01:21:02,479
There's something
I have to know.

1332
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:06,817
All of the kids in this
town you could have taken,

1333
01:21:06,884 --> 01:21:08,752
why Georgie?

1334
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:16,393
Say something!

1335
01:21:18,729 --> 01:21:19,763
Why him?

1336
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:21,966
Why him?
Why him? Why him?

1337
01:21:42,252 --> 01:21:43,820
Why?

1338
01:21:47,892 --> 01:21:52,729
Because you weren't
there, Billy.

1339
01:22:07,945 --> 01:22:09,713
Billy,
don't leave.

1340
01:22:11,381 --> 01:22:12,582
Hello?

1341
01:22:15,153 --> 01:22:16,386
Billy.

1342
01:22:20,858 --> 01:22:21,926
I'm still here.

1343
01:22:25,163 --> 01:22:26,864
Help me.

1344
01:22:27,965 --> 01:22:28,966
Georgie.

1345
01:22:34,939 --> 01:22:35,973
Georgie?

1346
01:22:37,141 --> 01:22:38,642
Help me, Billy.

1347
01:22:39,543 --> 01:22:41,245
Take my hand.

1348
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Take my hand.
I've got you, buddy.
Come on.
He's coming.
Take my hand!
- I got you. Come on.
- Billy, please. He's coming.

1349
01:22:49,719 --> 01:22:51,055
- Take my hand.
- Billy!

1350
01:22:51,122 --> 01:22:52,622
Come on,
take my hand!

1351
01:23:15,146 --> 01:23:16,780
I hate you!

1352
01:23:17,581 --> 01:23:19,884
I hate you.

1353
01:23:19,951 --> 01:23:21,351
Who are
you talking to?

1354
01:23:23,321 --> 01:23:24,487
Move, move, move!

1355
01:23:24,554 --> 01:23:26,690
Move! Move!

1356
01:23:26,756 --> 01:23:28,825
You hear voices from that
sewer, you stay away from it.

1357
01:23:30,527 --> 01:23:32,864
You hear voices
from the sewer?

1358
01:23:33,331 --> 01:23:34,464
No.

1359
01:23:34,531 --> 01:23:37,101
No. Just stay away
from that sewer.

1360
01:23:40,304 --> 01:23:41,873
I only hear voices
in the tub.

1361
01:23:43,807 --> 01:23:46,077
You know.
From the drain.

1362
01:23:47,777 --> 01:23:49,679
What kind of voices?

1363
01:23:50,413 --> 01:23:51,648
Kids.

1364
01:23:52,649 --> 01:23:54,986
And other times,
like a...

1365
01:23:55,052 --> 01:23:56,087
Like a clown?

1366
01:24:02,059 --> 01:24:03,560
You listen to me.
You listen good.

1367
01:24:03,627 --> 01:24:05,997
You need to
get out of this town.

1368
01:24:06,063 --> 01:24:07,831
All right? Tell your parents.
Make up a reason.

1369
01:24:07,899 --> 01:24:09,566
You make up a fucking lie.
I don't care what you do.

1370
01:24:09,633 --> 01:24:10,868
Just get out of this town.
Make them

1371
01:24:10,935 --> 01:24:12,702
never bring you back.
Do you understand?

1372
01:24:12,769 --> 01:24:14,638
You leave Derry and
you stay out of Derry!

1373
01:24:14,704 --> 01:24:15,973
Do you understand me?

1374
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,440
I'm supposed to be
at the festival.

1375
01:24:17,507 --> 01:24:20,011
Tell me you understand!

1376
01:24:25,016 --> 01:24:27,318
I'm supposed to be
at the festival.

1377
01:24:27,385 --> 01:24:29,053
I gotta go.

1378
01:24:31,923 --> 01:24:33,157
Just be careful!

1379
01:25:15,665 --> 01:25:17,600
Come on,
let's get the fuck outta here.

1380
01:25:18,468 --> 01:25:20,637
Wake up, fat-ass.

1381
01:25:23,341 --> 01:25:25,042
Fucking loser.

1382
01:25:47,965 --> 01:25:49,400
Whoa.

1383
01:25:49,467 --> 01:25:52,569
Easy. It's just me.

1384
01:25:52,635 --> 01:25:55,439
What are you and your little
buddies up to in here?

1385
01:25:55,505 --> 01:25:58,742
Oh. Those guys are
definitely not my buddies.

1386
01:25:58,808 --> 01:26:00,543
No, I meant
your real friends.

1387
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:02,279
Joey. Jonathan.
Donnie. Danny.

1388
01:26:02,346 --> 01:26:03,914
Oh.

1389
01:26:07,451 --> 01:26:09,020
Are you smoking
in school?

1390
01:26:10,421 --> 01:26:12,223
Secret hideout.

1391
01:26:13,257 --> 01:26:14,624
Don't tell anyone.

1392
01:26:22,532 --> 01:26:24,135
You okay, new kid?

1393
01:26:24,201 --> 01:26:25,702
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

1394
01:26:27,271 --> 01:26:29,806
I guess I'm just worried

1395
01:26:31,409 --> 01:26:35,745
that we're not all gonna be
the same after the fight.

1396
01:26:35,812 --> 01:26:37,882
As long as we can still hang
out, who cares?

1397
01:26:39,816 --> 01:26:41,018
You really mean that?

1398
01:26:43,954 --> 01:26:46,556
Well, yeah,
of course, dummy.

1399
01:26:51,295 --> 01:26:52,629
You and me.

1400
01:26:58,302 --> 01:26:59,702
Oh, my God!

1401
01:27:01,539 --> 01:27:02,907
I meant as a friend.

1402
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You actually thought
I could like someone
as fat and gross and
disgusting like you?

1403
01:27:11,848 --> 01:27:13,616
No matter
how many stupid poems

1404
01:27:13,683 --> 01:27:14,919
you write.

1405
01:27:22,659 --> 01:27:24,794
"Your hair is winter fire.

1406
01:27:31,168 --> 01:27:32,735
"January embers.

1407
01:27:35,139 --> 01:27:37,774
"My heart
burns there, too."

1408
01:28:03,067 --> 01:28:05,035
That's not the real Beverly.

1409
01:28:05,102 --> 01:28:07,704
Beverly would never
say anything like that.

1410
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:09,206
She'd never say that.

1411
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

1412
01:28:24,054 --> 01:28:26,756
Kiss me, fat boy.

1413
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:42,273
Oh, nobody wants to
kiss the fat boy.

1414
01:28:42,339 --> 01:28:43,641
Just leave me alone.

1415
01:28:43,706 --> 01:28:45,543
Alone?

1416
01:28:45,609 --> 01:28:49,647
Oh, you've always
been alone.

1417
01:28:49,712 --> 01:28:52,883
That's not true.
I have real friends.

1418
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:54,885
Bill. Eddie. Mike. Stanley.
Richie. Beverly.

1419
01:28:54,952 --> 01:28:56,786
They're my real friends.

1420
01:28:56,854 --> 01:29:00,558
Kiss me as if it
were the last time.

1421
01:29:07,932 --> 01:29:09,766
What the hell
are you doing, kid?

1422
01:29:26,317 --> 01:29:27,851
Guys?

1423
01:29:28,619 --> 01:29:29,819
Hey.

1424
01:29:31,422 --> 01:29:32,789
Hey.

1425
01:29:34,258 --> 01:29:36,560
So, what did you see
out there?

1426
01:29:36,627 --> 01:29:38,728
Something I wish
I hadn't.

1427
01:29:42,366 --> 01:29:43,766
So, what, we just...

1428
01:29:46,670 --> 01:29:50,807
We kill It, and then we just
forget everything again?

1429
01:29:50,874 --> 01:29:53,177
I hope so.
Don't you?

1430
01:29:53,244 --> 01:29:55,479
I don't know.

1431
01:29:55,546 --> 01:29:58,415
I guess I want to hold on
to the good stuff, you know?

1432
01:29:58,482 --> 01:29:59,782
Mmm.

1433
01:29:59,849 --> 01:30:01,252
Come on.
There must be something from

1434
01:30:01,318 --> 01:30:03,387
the past that you don't
want to forget again.

1435
01:30:05,256 --> 01:30:07,458
I remember
being scared shitless.

1436
01:30:08,425 --> 01:30:10,861
Cold.

1437
01:30:10,928 --> 01:30:13,397
I remember you guys
in your tighty-whities.

1438
01:30:13,464 --> 01:30:16,367
Okay. Please forget
that moment.

1439
01:30:18,002 --> 01:30:20,204
I remember this.

1440
01:30:22,439 --> 01:30:25,209
I remember the boy
who wrote it for me.

1441
01:30:27,645 --> 01:30:29,446
Not him, so much,

1442
01:30:31,715 --> 01:30:33,917
but how he made me feel.

1443
01:30:36,854 --> 01:30:38,922
And a kiss.

1444
01:30:43,694 --> 01:30:47,564
It's still blurry,
but I think the longer we're here,

1445
01:30:47,631 --> 01:30:49,400
the more I can see it.

1446
01:30:49,466 --> 01:30:51,834
The more I can see that moment.

1447
01:30:51,902 --> 01:30:53,337
The more
I can see...

1448
01:30:54,371 --> 01:30:55,372
Bill.

1449
01:30:58,342 --> 01:30:59,476
I think.

1450
01:31:01,779 --> 01:31:04,481
I don't know.
Do you remember...

1451
01:31:06,317 --> 01:31:08,485
Bev, um...

1452
01:31:09,987 --> 01:31:11,955
- Move. Move.
- What's wrong?

1453
01:31:12,022 --> 01:31:14,091
I'm leaving.

1454
01:31:14,158 --> 01:31:15,693
What?
You can't leave, man.

1455
01:31:15,759 --> 01:31:17,328
We split,
we all die.

1456
01:31:17,394 --> 01:31:19,430
Yeah, I'll take my chances.
We're gonna die, anyway.

1457
01:31:20,064 --> 01:31:22,299
Rich. Um...

1458
01:31:24,401 --> 01:31:25,969
Rich.

1459
01:31:27,471 --> 01:31:30,107
Hey, kids!
It's Burrow the Beaver!

1460
01:31:30,174 --> 01:31:32,376
Come on down.
It's the last day

1461
01:31:32,443 --> 01:31:34,812
of the festival here
at Canal Days.

1462
01:31:36,613 --> 01:31:37,614
Ahh!

1463
01:31:38,282 --> 01:31:39,383
Asshole!

1464
01:31:53,063 --> 01:31:54,531
Hello?

1465
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:08,011
Can I help you?

1466
01:32:08,078 --> 01:32:09,513
Yeah, I called in...

1467
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:11,248
I had prescription
called in for Kaspbrak.

1468
01:32:11,715 --> 01:32:12,916
Kaspbrak?

1469
01:32:12,983 --> 01:32:14,184
It's an inhaler.

1470
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:18,822
Uh... Eddie Kaspbrak?

1471
01:32:18,889 --> 01:32:20,457
Mmm-hmm.
That's me.

1472
01:32:21,759 --> 01:32:22,960
I remember you.

1473
01:32:23,394 --> 01:32:24,561
Yeah.

1474
01:32:24,628 --> 01:32:26,196
- Mmm-hmm.
- How's your mom?

1475
01:32:26,263 --> 01:32:28,031
Oh, uh...
Well, she died a few years ago.

1476
01:32:28,098 --> 01:32:29,466
It's very sad.
It was from liver cancer.

1477
01:32:29,533 --> 01:32:30,734
What's that?

1478
01:32:30,801 --> 01:32:32,903
- What's what?
- That.

1479
01:32:34,171 --> 01:32:35,939
- All right.
- Uh-huh.

1480
01:32:36,006 --> 01:32:37,241
Okay.

1481
01:32:37,307 --> 01:32:39,576
No, it's not gonna pop.
It's a mole.

1482
01:32:39,643 --> 01:32:41,779
It might not be cancer.

1483
01:32:41,845 --> 01:32:43,046
Cancer?

1484
01:32:45,416 --> 01:32:46,950
But it might be.

1485
01:32:47,017 --> 01:32:48,819
You just stay here.

1486
01:32:48,887 --> 01:32:50,855
I'll get you something.

1487
01:32:52,656 --> 01:32:53,957
Okay.

1488
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:05,602
You came here for your
stinky breath pills?

1489
01:33:07,104 --> 01:33:09,306
My breath
is fine.

1490
01:33:09,373 --> 01:33:11,141
Thank you.

1491
01:33:11,208 --> 01:33:13,878
That's not
what my dad said.

1492
01:33:13,944 --> 01:33:15,946
He said you have a tumor.

1493
01:33:18,582 --> 01:33:19,884
On your dick.

1494
01:33:21,118 --> 01:33:23,420
But you don't
take pills for...

1495
01:33:25,389 --> 01:33:26,690
Wait, what did
your dad say?

1496
01:33:27,691 --> 01:33:28,959
There you go.

1497
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:31,495
I hope your dick
feels better.

1498
01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:35,098
Thank you.

1499
01:33:36,467 --> 01:33:39,736
For the inhaler,
not for the penis thing.

1500
01:33:39,803 --> 01:33:42,005
Eddie!

1501
01:33:45,008 --> 01:33:47,110
Eddie bear!

1502
01:33:50,347 --> 01:33:51,648
Mommy?

1503
01:33:57,856 --> 01:33:59,423
Eddie bear!

1504
01:34:02,927 --> 01:34:04,294
Mommy?

1505
01:34:07,197 --> 01:34:09,500
Eddie, come help me!
Quick!

1506
01:34:26,416 --> 01:34:27,952
Eddie!

1507
01:34:28,018 --> 01:34:29,453
Mommy?

1508
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:30,687
Eddie?

1509
01:34:30,754 --> 01:34:32,155
Eddie, help me!

1510
01:34:32,222 --> 01:34:33,690
Quick, help me!

1511
01:34:33,757 --> 01:34:36,026
Mommy?

1512
01:34:36,093 --> 01:34:38,161
Eddie bear,
come help me, quick!

1513
01:34:54,979 --> 01:34:57,114
Eddie?

1514
01:34:57,180 --> 01:34:58,849
The fuck
is she doing here?

1515
01:34:58,917 --> 01:35:00,250
What is taking you
so long?

1516
01:35:00,317 --> 01:35:02,386
I don't know.
Why are you here?

1517
01:35:11,795 --> 01:35:13,363
Mommy!

1518
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:15,132
He's coming!
You gotta get me outta here!

1519
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:16,833
- Who's coming?
- Eddie.

1520
01:35:18,502 --> 01:35:20,470
What the fuck is that?

1521
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:29,446
- Mommy.
- You gotta get me outta here.

1522
01:35:29,513 --> 01:35:30,982
He's coming!

1523
01:35:31,049 --> 01:35:33,083
He's gonna kill me!
Eddie!

1524
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:36,587
Help! Please, help me!
He's going to infect me!

1525
01:35:36,653 --> 01:35:39,256
Eddie! He's gonna infect me!
Eddie!

1526
01:35:39,323 --> 01:35:41,291
Help me!

1527
01:35:42,659 --> 01:35:44,862
Help me, Eddie!
He's coming, Eddie!

1528
01:35:44,929 --> 01:35:47,497
Eddie, hurry!

1529
01:35:47,564 --> 01:35:49,700
He's gonna infect me, Eddie!

1530
01:35:52,402 --> 01:35:53,604
Oh, my God!
Eddie!

1531
01:35:54,805 --> 01:35:55,839
Hurry up, Eddie!

1532
01:36:01,913 --> 01:36:03,213
Eddie!

1533
01:36:11,121 --> 01:36:12,823
- I can't do it!
- Eddie! Eddie!

1534
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:15,525
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

1535
01:36:15,592 --> 01:36:18,428
I knew you would leave me, Eddie!

1536
01:36:20,664 --> 01:36:22,165
Eddie, help me!

1537
01:36:27,804 --> 01:36:28,940
Eddie!

1538
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:36,246
What's all this shit
doing here?

1539
01:36:36,313 --> 01:36:38,248
Why is that curtain
still here?

1540
01:36:38,849 --> 01:36:39,951
Okay, all right.

1541
01:36:40,018 --> 01:36:42,252
Are you gonna
do this, Eds?

1542
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:43,520
It's just a memory.

1543
01:36:43,587 --> 01:36:45,023
It's just a memory.
You're fine.

1544
01:36:45,089 --> 01:36:47,424
Deep breath.
Deep breath.

1545
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Okay.
You gonna do it?

1546
01:37:00,038 --> 01:37:02,006
Shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck!

1547
01:37:08,178 --> 01:37:09,713
Stop! Stop!

1548
01:37:30,267 --> 01:37:31,568
That's right!

1549
01:37:32,636 --> 01:37:34,538
Fuck you!

1550
01:37:34,604 --> 01:37:36,673
Fuck you!

1551
01:37:50,021 --> 01:37:51,455
What the fuck?

1552
01:37:56,094 --> 01:37:57,627
What?

1553
01:37:57,694 --> 01:37:59,396
Push, don't pull,
you moron.

1554
01:37:59,463 --> 01:38:01,665
Oh. Thanks.

1555
01:38:15,846 --> 01:38:18,248
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?

1556
01:38:18,315 --> 01:38:19,549
Nothing. I'm fine.

1557
01:38:19,616 --> 01:38:21,618
I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

1558
01:38:23,054 --> 01:38:24,521
Hey, how you doing?
Where's everybody else?

1559
01:38:24,588 --> 01:38:25,890
Richie wants to leave.

1560
01:38:25,957 --> 01:38:27,357
Ben's upstairs
trying to get him to stay.

1561
01:38:27,424 --> 01:38:29,359
Eddie's just scared.

1562
01:38:29,426 --> 01:38:30,694
So am I, Bill.

1563
01:38:30,761 --> 01:38:32,230
Aren't you?

1564
01:38:32,295 --> 01:38:33,865
We're all scared.

1565
01:38:33,931 --> 01:38:35,066
That's what worries me.

1566
01:38:35,133 --> 01:38:36,466
Because that's
what It wants.

1567
01:38:36,533 --> 01:38:37,834
We can do this,

1568
01:38:37,902 --> 01:38:39,336
but we have
to stick together.

1569
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:38,996
Should we be running?

1570
01:39:39,063 --> 01:39:40,898
This is Derry.
I'm kinda getting used to it.

1571
01:40:10,127 --> 01:40:11,128
What does that mean?

1572
01:40:12,696 --> 01:40:14,364
Shit. It's the kid.

1573
01:40:15,032 --> 01:40:16,533
What?

1574
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,870
It's the kid
from the place.

1575
01:40:18,936 --> 01:40:20,004
The Chinese place.

1576
01:40:20,071 --> 01:40:21,138
I saw him
on the way here.

1577
01:40:21,205 --> 01:40:23,040
He lives
at my old house.

1578
01:40:23,107 --> 01:40:25,042
He was going to the fair, and...

1579
01:40:28,511 --> 01:40:30,047
He's going to the fair.
I gotta help him.

1580
01:40:30,114 --> 01:40:32,016
Okay, okay. Listen to me.
We'll go together.

1581
01:40:32,083 --> 01:40:33,885
I'm gonna get Richie
and Ben and we'll go.

1582
01:40:33,951 --> 01:40:36,486
There's no time.
I can't let it happen again.

1583
01:40:36,553 --> 01:40:38,055
What happened before
wasn't your fault.

1584
01:40:38,122 --> 01:40:39,190
None of it was.

1585
01:40:39,257 --> 01:40:40,858
I wish
that were true, Bev.

1586
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:45,863
Bill! Bev!

1587
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:48,132
- What is this? What happened?
- Uh...

1588
01:40:48,199 --> 01:40:49,367
Did Bill just leave?

1589
01:40:49,432 --> 01:40:50,500
I couldn't stop him.

1590
01:40:50,567 --> 01:40:51,869
Everybody's leaving.

1591
01:40:51,936 --> 01:40:53,436
It's all right. It's Bill.
He'll be back.

1592
01:40:53,503 --> 01:40:55,373
He'll come back.

1593
01:40:55,438 --> 01:40:57,641
Well, at least
I got Richie to stay.

1594
01:41:00,211 --> 01:41:01,544
Fuck. Oh.

1595
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1596
01:41:18,396 --> 01:41:20,197
Oh. And then the leper,
he threw up all over me.

1597
01:41:20,264 --> 01:41:21,464
"Hey, it's Mike Hanlon.

1598
01:41:21,531 --> 01:41:22,599
"Why don't you
come back to Maine?"

1599
01:41:25,769 --> 01:41:27,537
It's your time, Eddie.

1600
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:30,274
What?

1601
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:34,211
Why?

1602
01:41:34,278 --> 01:41:35,947
Why did you do that?

1603
01:41:36,013 --> 01:41:38,682
Because he says
it's your time.

1604
01:41:38,748 --> 01:41:40,684
Who says it's my time?

1605
01:41:42,386 --> 01:41:44,288
You know, Eddie.

1606
01:41:44,355 --> 01:41:46,390
You know.

1607
01:41:46,456 --> 01:41:48,392
Time to float.

1608
01:41:54,531 --> 01:41:56,133
Where did he go?

1609
01:41:58,970 --> 01:42:01,906
Now give me back
my fucking knife!

1610
01:42:19,190 --> 01:42:20,458
You should cut
that fucking mullet.

1611
01:42:20,523 --> 01:42:22,460
It's been, like,
30 years, man.

1612
01:42:22,525 --> 01:42:24,061
Guys!

1613
01:42:25,896 --> 01:42:26,998
Oh, shit.

1614
01:42:28,832 --> 01:42:29,833
Eds?

1615
01:42:31,768 --> 01:42:34,105
Jesus, Eds.
What the hell?

1616
01:42:34,171 --> 01:42:35,772
- Bowers is in my room.
- Oh, my...

1617
01:42:38,175 --> 01:42:39,910
- Is it bad?
- No.

1618
01:42:54,624 --> 01:42:56,227
<i>I'm gonna
carve my whole name</i>

1619
01:42:56,293 --> 01:42:57,594
<i>onto this cottage cheese!</i>

1620
01:43:04,734 --> 01:43:06,170
One down!

1621
01:43:07,405 --> 01:43:08,906
Fuck yeah!

1622
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:37,535
Hey!

1623
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,602
Hey, kid! Kid!

1624
01:43:40,905 --> 01:43:43,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1625
01:43:43,107 --> 01:43:44,108
Hey!

1626
01:43:44,175 --> 01:43:46,544
Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey! Hey!

1627
01:43:46,609 --> 01:43:48,179
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1628
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Fuck.

1629
01:44:02,393 --> 01:44:03,827
Fuck!

1630
01:44:20,945 --> 01:44:22,679
Kid! Hey, kid!

1631
01:44:23,547 --> 01:44:24,848
Fuck.

1632
01:44:25,249 --> 01:44:26,250
Kid?

1633
01:44:30,588 --> 01:44:31,788
Fuck.

1634
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:44,401
Kid?

1635
01:44:45,002 --> 01:44:46,036
Hey!

1636
01:44:54,612 --> 01:44:55,845
Kid.

1637
01:45:02,153 --> 01:45:04,155
Kid? Hey! Hey!

1638
01:45:04,221 --> 01:45:05,523
Kid!

1639
01:45:05,589 --> 01:45:07,424
Fuck.

1640
01:45:08,225 --> 01:45:09,293
Shit.

1641
01:45:10,094 --> 01:45:11,562
Hey.

1642
01:45:11,629 --> 01:45:12,695
What are you
doing here?

1643
01:45:12,762 --> 01:45:14,565
Hey.

1644
01:45:14,632 --> 01:45:17,168
No, I'm here to
help.

1645
01:45:17,234 --> 01:45:18,801
Stop following me!

1646
01:45:18,869 --> 01:45:21,205
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

1647
01:45:27,645 --> 01:45:28,845
No.

1648
01:45:31,115 --> 01:45:32,183
Please.

1649
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,088
Ah.

1650
01:45:38,155 --> 01:45:40,224
I'm here this time.
Just take me.

1651
01:45:46,230 --> 01:45:47,231
Son of a bitch!

1652
01:45:58,642 --> 01:45:59,742
Help!

1653
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:05,216
Help!

1654
01:46:06,317 --> 01:46:07,351
Help!

1655
01:46:33,611 --> 01:46:35,312
I should go back there.
I just fucking

1656
01:46:35,379 --> 01:46:37,214
left them in the lurch, man.
I should go back there.

1657
01:46:37,281 --> 01:46:39,250
What the fuck are you talking about?
Fuck that.

1658
01:46:39,316 --> 01:46:40,384
Fuck them.

1659
01:46:41,784 --> 01:46:44,388
I got dates
in fucking Reno, man.

1660
01:46:53,731 --> 01:46:55,466
<i>Reflecting
on the meaning of</i>

1661
01:46:55,532 --> 01:46:56,833
<i>what I just read,</i>

1662
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:59,270
the word <i>"Leshanot"</i>
comes up a lot,

1663
01:46:59,336 --> 01:47:02,273
which means "to
change, to transform."

1664
01:47:03,173 --> 01:47:05,242
Which makes sense,
I guess,

1665
01:47:05,309 --> 01:47:08,078
because today I'm
supposed to become a man.

1666
01:47:11,181 --> 01:47:13,517
<i>It's funny, though.</i>

1667
01:47:13,584 --> 01:47:16,920
<i>Everyone, I think,
has some memories</i>

1668
01:47:16,987 --> 01:47:18,856
<i>they're prouder of
than others, right?</i>

1669
01:47:20,624 --> 01:47:24,061
<i>And maybe that's why
change is so scary.</i>

1670
01:47:25,996 --> 01:47:28,499
<i>'Cause the things we wish
we could leave behind...</i>

1671
01:47:29,967 --> 01:47:32,369
- Good morning, Mike.
- How you doing?

1672
01:47:32,436 --> 01:47:34,338
<i>...the whispers we wish
we could silence...</i>

1673
01:47:34,405 --> 01:47:37,875
His pa is the one.
The one that set that fire.

1674
01:47:39,943 --> 01:47:43,213
<i>...the nightmares we most
want to wake up from,</i>

1675
01:47:45,649 --> 01:47:48,552
<i>the memories we wish

1676
01:47:53,123 --> 01:47:56,093
<i>...the secrets we feel
like we have to keep</i>

1677
01:47:58,162 --> 01:48:00,931
<i>are the hardest to
walk away from.</i>

1678
01:48:04,802 --> 01:48:07,338
<i>The good stuff?</i>

1679
01:48:07,404 --> 01:48:11,608
<i>The pictures in our mind
that fade away the fastest?</i>

1680
01:48:11,675 --> 01:48:15,279
<i>Those pieces of you it
feels the easiest to lose.</i>

1681
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:20,017
<i>Maybe I don't want to forget.</i>

1682
01:48:22,052 --> 01:48:25,356
Maybe if that's what
today is all about,

1683
01:48:27,624 --> 01:48:29,526
forget it, right?

1684
01:48:29,593 --> 01:48:31,228
Thank you, Stanley.

1685
01:48:31,295 --> 01:48:32,963
Today, I'm supposed
to become a man,

1686
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:36,033
but I don't feel
any different.

1687
01:48:38,001 --> 01:48:40,104
I know I'm a loser.

1688
01:48:40,170 --> 01:48:42,373
And no matter what,

1689
01:48:42,439 --> 01:48:44,375
I always fucking will be.

1690
01:49:04,762 --> 01:49:06,630
Thanks for showing up,
Stanley.

1691
01:49:48,172 --> 01:49:50,541
<i>Mike! Help!</i>

1692
01:49:52,342 --> 01:49:53,510
Help us!

Upcoming jump scare (Major)
- Please, Mikey, get help!
- Help us!
Please, Mikey,
get help!
Mikey!

1694
01:50:26,610 --> 01:50:29,413
You should
have burned, Mike.

1695
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,488
Just like
your druggie parents.

1696
01:50:37,554 --> 01:50:40,290
Can you see them yet?

1697
01:50:40,357 --> 01:50:41,692
Crisping?

1698
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:45,429
Like fried fucking...

1699
01:50:57,441 --> 01:51:00,110
I guess you could say
that was long overdue.

1700
01:51:00,177 --> 01:51:02,012
Get it?
'Cause we're in a library.

1701
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:03,647
No.

1702
01:51:04,916 --> 01:51:06,116
Oh...

1703
01:51:08,619 --> 01:51:09,854
Mike?

1704
01:51:09,921 --> 01:51:12,122
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, my God.

1705
01:51:18,161 --> 01:51:19,763
Are you all right?

1706
01:51:19,830 --> 01:51:21,532
No, I'm not all right.
I just fucking killed a guy.

1707
01:51:22,699 --> 01:51:24,201
I was talking to Mike.

1708
01:51:26,270 --> 01:51:27,771
Where's Bill?

1709
01:51:33,443 --> 01:51:34,778
Bill, we're all
at the library.

1710
01:51:34,845 --> 01:51:36,280
Where are you at?

1711
01:51:36,346 --> 01:51:38,582
He took a little
kid, Mike.

1712
01:51:38,649 --> 01:51:42,219
He took a little kid right
in fucking front of me.

1713
01:51:42,286 --> 01:51:44,054
No, no, no, no, no.
Just, just...

1714
01:51:44,121 --> 01:51:45,489
Look, just come here
to the library.

1715
01:51:45,556 --> 01:51:47,057
We can talk about
the plan.

1716
01:51:47,124 --> 01:51:49,226
- I'm gonna go kill It.
- <i>No, no, no.</i>

1717
01:51:49,293 --> 01:51:53,096
I don't want any of you
to get killed with me.

1718
01:51:53,163 --> 01:51:54,531
<i>Bill! Bill!</i>

1719
01:51:59,303 --> 01:52:00,939
He's going
to fight It alone.

1720
01:52:01,005 --> 01:52:03,373
- What?
- Alone.

1721
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:04,708
It's about the group.

1722
01:52:04,775 --> 01:52:06,209
The ritual doesn't work
without the group.

1723
01:52:06,276 --> 01:52:07,844
Doing it together
is why it'd work.

1724
01:52:11,782 --> 01:52:14,217
Mike, did he tell you
where he was going?

1725
01:52:14,284 --> 01:52:16,119
If he really wanted
to kill Pennywise,

1726
01:52:16,186 --> 01:52:17,721
there's only one place
he'll go.

1727
01:52:17,788 --> 01:52:19,656
The same place the ritual
needs to be performed.

1728
01:52:19,723 --> 01:52:22,159
Oh, we're not gonna like
this, are we?

1729
01:52:23,126 --> 01:52:24,595
Fuck.

1730
01:52:54,058 --> 01:52:55,927
Bill!

1731
01:52:55,994 --> 01:52:58,029
No, no,
you guys, no!

1732
01:52:58,096 --> 01:53:00,098
I started all this.

1733
01:53:00,163 --> 01:53:02,934
It's my fault that
you're all here.

1734
01:53:03,001 --> 01:53:06,436
This curse, this fucking
thing that's inside you all.

1735
01:53:06,503 --> 01:53:08,472
It started growing
the day

1736
01:53:08,538 --> 01:53:10,074
that I made you go
down to the Barrens

1737
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:14,778
because all I cared about
was finding Georgie.

1738
01:53:16,213 --> 01:53:17,681
Now, I'm gonna
go in there,

1739
01:53:17,748 --> 01:53:19,416
and I don't know
what's gonna happen,

1740
01:53:19,483 --> 01:53:22,285
but I can't ask you
to do this.

1741
01:53:24,354 --> 01:53:25,689
Well,

1742
01:53:25,756 --> 01:53:27,925
we're not asking you,
either.

1743
01:53:27,992 --> 01:53:29,027
- Bev...
- We didn't

1744
01:53:29,093 --> 01:53:30,627
do it alone
then, Bill,

1745
01:53:30,694 --> 01:53:33,330
so we're not gonna
do this alone now.

1746
01:53:33,397 --> 01:53:35,632
Losers stick together.

1747
01:53:41,204 --> 01:53:43,875
So, does somebody
want to say something?

1748
01:53:45,709 --> 01:53:48,845
Richie said it best
when we were here last.

1749
01:53:48,913 --> 01:53:50,280
I did?

1750
01:53:51,848 --> 01:53:54,651
- "I don't want to die"?
- Not that.

1751
01:53:54,718 --> 01:53:56,486
"You're lucky we're
not measuring dicks"?

1752
01:53:57,955 --> 01:53:59,456
No.

1753
01:54:01,491 --> 01:54:02,927
"Let's kill
this fucking clown"?

1754
01:54:06,864 --> 01:54:09,533
Let's kill this
fucking clown.

1755
01:54:34,357 --> 01:54:35,826
Hmm.

1756
01:54:35,893 --> 01:54:37,494
Well, I love what he's
done with the place.

1757
01:54:38,228 --> 01:54:39,362
Beep-beep, Richie.

1758
01:54:39,429 --> 01:54:40,697
All right.

1759
01:54:59,716 --> 01:55:01,818
Hey, hey.
That's the basement, right?

1760
01:55:07,791 --> 01:55:09,526
Ben?

1761
01:55:09,593 --> 01:55:11,828
No, no!
Hey, hey! Ben!

1762
01:55:11,896 --> 01:55:12,997
Ben!

1763
01:55:13,064 --> 01:55:14,065
Ben? What's wrong?

1764
01:55:16,399 --> 01:55:18,602
- Ben!
- Okay. All right.

1765
01:55:18,668 --> 01:55:20,303
Ben!

1766
01:55:26,443 --> 01:55:28,445
Okay, that can't
be good, right?

1767
01:55:29,881 --> 01:55:31,615
Help! Hey!

1768
01:55:38,256 --> 01:55:39,456
Ugh!

1769
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:47,330
It's Stan.

1770
01:55:51,102 --> 01:55:52,302
It can't
be real.

1771
01:55:53,938 --> 01:55:55,973
Oh!

1772
01:55:57,507 --> 01:55:58,943
Oh, God.

1773
01:55:59,010 --> 01:56:00,077
Shit.

1774
01:56:08,318 --> 01:56:10,754
I'd still be alive if
it wasn't for you, Bill.

1775
01:56:11,889 --> 01:56:12,890
No.

1776
01:56:17,295 --> 01:56:18,628
Beverly!

1777
01:56:40,550 --> 01:56:42,752
Richie, what's happening to me?

1778
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You gotta be
fucking kidding.

1779
01:57:10,447 --> 01:57:12,749
Fuck!

1780
01:57:14,185 --> 01:57:17,554
Oh, God damn it, get it away from me.
Oh, God!

1781
01:57:20,523 --> 01:57:22,559
Whoa, whoa!

1782
01:57:33,237 --> 01:57:34,372
Eddie.

1783
01:57:34,437 --> 01:57:36,573
Hey. Are you okay?

1784
01:57:37,074 --> 01:57:38,075
I'm...

1785
01:57:43,281 --> 01:57:44,514
Oh, there he is.

1786
01:57:48,252 --> 01:57:49,452
Get it off of me!

1787
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,123
Get it off of me!

1788
01:57:54,091 --> 01:57:55,026
Richie!

1789
01:57:55,092 --> 01:57:57,395
- Richie!
- Richie! Hey!

1790
01:58:00,064 --> 01:58:01,731
- Get it off of me!
- I wanna go home.

1791
01:58:03,301 --> 01:58:04,801
Get the knife!

1792
01:58:04,869 --> 01:58:06,636
God damn it, Eddie,
get the knife!

1793
01:58:06,703 --> 01:58:09,206
Bill! Get it off of me, Bill!
Quick!

1794
01:58:11,708 --> 01:58:13,476
Eddie, get the knife!

1795
01:58:14,111 --> 01:58:15,679
Ahh! Fuck!

1796
01:58:36,367 --> 01:58:37,368
What?

1797
01:58:49,246 --> 01:58:51,048
Is everybody okay?

1798
01:58:51,115 --> 01:58:53,918
You all right?

1799
01:58:53,985 --> 01:58:56,287
He could have
fucking died, man.

1800
01:58:56,354 --> 01:58:57,487
You know that, right?

1801
01:58:57,554 --> 01:58:59,123
I can't see.

1802
01:58:59,190 --> 01:59:02,826
Georgie's dead. The kid's dead.
Stanley's dead.

1803
01:59:02,893 --> 01:59:05,429
You want Richie, too?
You want Richie, too?

1804
01:59:05,495 --> 01:59:07,764
I don't want Richie, too.
I don't. I don't.

1805
01:59:12,502 --> 01:59:14,504
Please don't
be mad, Bill.

1806
01:59:18,409 --> 01:59:20,277
I was just scared.

1807
01:59:22,779 --> 01:59:25,715
That's what
he wants, right?

1808
01:59:28,185 --> 01:59:30,121
Don't give it to him.

1809
01:59:42,665 --> 01:59:44,268
A lot of memories, huh?

1810
01:59:46,536 --> 01:59:47,837
All bad.

1811
02:00:00,550 --> 02:00:01,785
Oh, man.

1812
02:00:03,287 --> 02:00:05,256
Blech. Gray water.

1813
02:00:43,561 --> 02:00:44,995
Shit. This is it.

1814
02:00:46,964 --> 02:00:48,199
This is where
it happened.

1815
02:01:04,081 --> 02:01:05,648
No, no, no.

1816
02:01:05,715 --> 02:01:07,284
No. Ugh!

1817
02:01:15,860 --> 02:01:17,161
Bevvie.

1818
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Bev, what is it?

1819
02:01:33,010 --> 02:01:34,612
I thought
I heard something.

1820
02:01:37,148 --> 02:01:38,516
Bev!

1821
02:01:38,582 --> 02:01:39,950
Time to sink!

1822
02:01:43,653 --> 02:01:45,055
Bev!

1823
02:01:46,957 --> 02:01:48,192
Guys.

1824
02:01:51,395 --> 02:01:53,063
Okay, guys.
Come on.

1825
02:01:57,535 --> 02:01:59,303
Hey, guys.

1826
02:01:59,370 --> 02:02:01,472
Guys, come on.
Please, come on.

1827
02:02:01,539 --> 02:02:03,340
I don't want to walk
out of here alone.

1828
02:02:07,178 --> 02:02:08,913
You okay?

1829
02:02:08,979 --> 02:02:11,182
I feel like crying.

1830
02:02:11,248 --> 02:02:14,051
Mike. Where do we go from here?

1831
02:02:21,091 --> 02:02:22,825
In the depths
is where It crept.

1832
02:02:22,893 --> 02:02:24,694
In the beneath,
to find belief.

1833
02:02:24,761 --> 02:02:26,063
In the depths
is where It crept.

1834
02:02:26,130 --> 02:02:27,598
In the beneath,
to find belief.

1835
02:02:27,665 --> 02:02:29,133
Is he okay?

1836
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:31,068
I think at this point,
that's a relative question.

1837
02:02:31,135 --> 02:02:32,903
What's on
the other side?

1838
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:35,339
I don't know.
No one does.

1839
02:02:38,175 --> 02:02:39,376
Whoa,
whoa, whoa!

1840
02:02:40,211 --> 02:02:41,212
Mike.

1841
02:02:46,317 --> 02:02:48,352
- Mike, don't.
- All right.

1842
02:02:48,419 --> 02:02:49,719
- See you down there.
- Mike!

1843
02:02:49,786 --> 02:02:51,021
Wait!

1844
02:02:57,194 --> 02:02:59,463
- Stay together.
- Okay.

1845
02:03:02,566 --> 02:03:03,800
You guys,
I can't do it.

1846
02:03:05,903 --> 02:03:08,038
I can't.
You saw what happened up there.

1847
02:03:08,105 --> 02:03:10,174
I was gonna
let you die.

1848
02:03:10,241 --> 02:03:12,142
I just fucking
froze up.

1849
02:03:12,209 --> 02:03:14,245
If you let me go
down there with you,

1850
02:03:14,311 --> 02:03:15,845
I'm gonna get us all killed.

1851
02:03:15,913 --> 02:03:17,014
Hey, hey, hey.
Give me that.

1852
02:03:17,081 --> 02:03:18,082
- Give me that.
- Richie.

1853
02:03:18,148 --> 02:03:19,782
Let go,
you little turd.

1854
02:03:19,849 --> 02:03:21,619
Just let me get...

1855
02:03:23,020 --> 02:03:24,221
- I got it.
- Stop.

1856
02:03:24,955 --> 02:03:26,490
Listen to me.

1857
02:03:26,557 --> 02:03:28,125
You had a moment.
Fine.

1858
02:03:28,192 --> 02:03:30,995
But who killed a psychotic
clown before he was 14?

1859
02:03:32,529 --> 02:03:33,664
Me.

1860
02:03:33,731 --> 02:03:34,797
Who stabbed Bowers
with a knife

1861
02:03:34,865 --> 02:03:36,133
he pulled out
of his own face?

1862
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:37,468
Also me.

1863
02:03:37,534 --> 02:03:39,236
Who married a woman 10
times his own body mass?

1864
02:03:41,804 --> 02:03:43,407
- Me.
- Yeah.

1865
02:03:46,443 --> 02:03:48,845
You're braver
than you think.

1866
02:03:48,912 --> 02:03:50,114
All right.
Thanks, Rich.

1867
02:03:51,048 --> 02:03:53,083
- Ow.
- Sorry.

1868
02:03:55,586 --> 02:03:56,720
Hey.
Here.

1869
02:03:56,786 --> 02:03:57,855
Take it.

1870
02:03:57,921 --> 02:03:59,822
It kills monsters.

1871
02:04:01,824 --> 02:04:04,061
- Does it?
- Yeah.

1872
02:04:04,128 --> 02:04:05,795
If you believe
it does.

1873
02:04:07,364 --> 02:04:08,432
Thanks, Bev.

1874
02:04:26,650 --> 02:04:27,785
You guys good?

1875
02:04:27,851 --> 02:04:29,119
Yeah.

1876
02:04:33,657 --> 02:04:34,758
Can you get through that?

1877
02:04:34,824 --> 02:04:35,893
It's the only way.
This way.

1878
02:04:35,959 --> 02:04:37,494
It's in here!

1879
02:04:41,432 --> 02:04:42,566
Through here.

1880
02:04:42,633 --> 02:04:44,535
It's tight,
but we can get through.

1881
02:05:00,084 --> 02:05:01,952
This is where It hid.

1882
02:05:22,539 --> 02:05:26,877
So, all this has been under
Derry, like, forever?

1883
02:05:26,944 --> 02:05:28,779
Not forever.

1884
02:05:28,846 --> 02:05:30,280
Just a few million years.

1885
02:06:06,216 --> 02:06:09,319
It can only be
attacked in its true form.

1886
02:06:09,386 --> 02:06:10,487
The ritual
will show us that.

1887
02:06:10,554 --> 02:06:12,156
And what is
It's true form?

1888
02:06:12,222 --> 02:06:14,057
I hope it's a puppy.

1889
02:06:14,124 --> 02:06:16,427
Like a Pomeranian or...

1890
02:06:16,493 --> 02:06:17,494
I'll shut up.

1891
02:06:18,495 --> 02:06:19,530
It's light.

1892
02:06:23,367 --> 02:06:25,436
A light that must be
snuffed out by darkness.

1893
02:06:38,615 --> 02:06:39,616
Your artifacts.

1894
02:06:41,218 --> 02:06:43,387
Place them in the fire.

1895
02:06:43,454 --> 02:06:45,522
The past must
burn with the present.

1896
02:06:53,964 --> 02:06:57,234
This is the boat
that I built

1897
02:06:59,670 --> 02:07:01,171
with Georgie.

1898
02:07:05,776 --> 02:07:08,045
It's my inhaler.

1899
02:07:13,283 --> 02:07:14,451
Come on, dude.

1900
02:07:17,054 --> 02:07:19,289
Something that
I wish I had held on to.

1901
02:07:24,963 --> 02:07:27,866
This is a page
from my yearbook.

1902
02:07:27,932 --> 02:07:30,534
That only
one person signed.

1903
02:07:30,601 --> 02:07:33,938
I probably should
have forgotten it,

1904
02:07:34,004 --> 02:07:36,473
but I couldn't,
because I kept it in my wallet

1905
02:07:38,275 --> 02:07:39,776
for 27 years.

1906
02:07:46,083 --> 02:07:47,651
This is a token
from the Capitol Theater.

1907
02:07:47,718 --> 02:07:49,353
- You brought an actual token?
- Yeah, man.

1908
02:07:49,419 --> 02:07:51,054
That's what we were supposed to
do, asshole.

1909
02:07:51,121 --> 02:07:52,723
Do you have any idea how long
that's gonna take to burn?

1910
02:07:52,789 --> 02:07:54,224
Yeah, but so is your
inhaler, dude.

1911
02:07:54,291 --> 02:07:55,927
Guys, come on.

1912
02:07:55,994 --> 02:07:57,794
All the toxic fumes and
the plastic and shit, so...

1913
02:08:00,731 --> 02:08:01,732
Look closely, Bev.

1914
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:05,102
You see it?

1915
02:08:05,168 --> 02:08:06,603
That's where
you hit Bowers.

1916
02:08:08,605 --> 02:08:09,606
The rock fight.

1917
02:08:12,109 --> 02:08:14,044
The day these bonds were forged.

1918
02:08:15,013 --> 02:08:16,513
That's not
gonna burn, either.

1919
02:08:22,052 --> 02:08:23,253
Oh, wait.

1920
02:08:26,657 --> 02:08:28,158
Couldn't forget
about Stan,

1921
02:08:28,893 --> 02:08:30,160
again.

1922
02:08:35,132 --> 02:08:36,767
Okay.

1923
02:08:36,833 --> 02:08:37,834
Grab hands.

1924
02:08:39,536 --> 02:08:40,571
Come on.

1925
02:08:48,178 --> 02:08:50,280
The Ritual of Chud.

1926
02:08:50,347 --> 02:08:53,150
It's a battle of wills.

1927
02:08:53,216 --> 02:08:55,686
The first step
was our reunion.

1928
02:08:55,752 --> 02:08:59,556
The second was
the gathering of tokens.

1929
02:09:01,425 --> 02:09:03,460
This is the final step.

1930
02:09:06,296 --> 02:09:07,497
What the...

1931
02:09:16,239 --> 02:09:17,875
Fuck is that?

1932
02:09:17,942 --> 02:09:19,309
- Don't look at them!
- Are those

1933
02:09:19,376 --> 02:09:21,012
- the Deadlights?
- Don't look at it!

1934
02:09:21,079 --> 02:09:22,713
Okay.

1935
02:09:22,779 --> 02:09:24,414
Turn light into dark.
Turn light into dark. Say it!

1936
02:09:24,481 --> 02:09:26,084
- Say what?
- Say it!

1937
02:09:26,183 --> 02:09:27,618
Turn light
into dark.

1938
02:09:29,586 --> 02:09:31,221
Turn light into dark.

1939
02:09:31,288 --> 02:09:32,789
Turn light
into dark.

1940
02:09:32,857 --> 02:09:34,491
Turn light
into dark.

1941
02:09:36,094 --> 02:09:38,362
Turn light into dark.

1942
02:09:50,942 --> 02:09:53,310
Turn light into dark.
Mike, what's happening, man?

1943
02:09:53,377 --> 02:09:55,013
Keep chanting!

1944
02:09:55,079 --> 02:09:56,279
Turn light
into dark.

1945
02:09:59,449 --> 02:10:01,919
Turn light
into dark!

1946
02:10:01,986 --> 02:10:03,855
Turn light
into dark!

1947
02:10:03,921 --> 02:10:06,657
Turn light into dark!
Turn light into dark!

1948
02:10:06,723 --> 02:10:08,358
- Keep chanting!
- Turn light into dark!

1949
02:10:08,425 --> 02:10:10,061
- Keep chanting!
- Turn light into dark!

1950
02:10:14,032 --> 02:10:15,967
Turn light into dark!
Turn light into dark!

1951
02:10:16,034 --> 02:10:17,068
Is it working?
Did we do it?

1952
02:10:20,804 --> 02:10:22,239
What is this?
Is this part of it?

1953
02:10:22,305 --> 02:10:23,774
Mike, is this supposed
to be happening?

1954
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:25,076
- What? No, no, no.
- Keep chanting!

1955
02:10:25,143 --> 02:10:26,610
- What?
- Keep chanting!

1956
02:10:26,677 --> 02:10:27,979
Turn light
into dark!

1957
02:10:28,046 --> 02:10:29,513
- Turn light into dark.
- Come on!

1958
02:10:29,579 --> 02:10:32,182
Turn light into dark.
Turn light into dark.

1959
02:10:32,249 --> 02:10:33,550
Whoa!

1960
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hey! Hey!

1961
02:10:43,794 --> 02:10:44,929
Shit!

1962
02:10:47,631 --> 02:10:50,667
Move, move!
Whoa!

1963
02:10:58,842 --> 02:11:00,777
Bev. Bev.

1964
02:11:01,913 --> 02:11:04,448
- Richie.
- Are you okay?

1965
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- I can't hear shit.
- He's okay.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. No, no, no.
- Wait, where's Mike?
- Mike!
Mike!

1966
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:12,522
- I'm here!
- Hey, guys.

1967
02:11:12,589 --> 02:11:14,591
Did we do it? Did we do it?
Yeah? Did we do it?

1968
02:11:14,658 --> 02:11:16,226
We put the
tokens in the thing.

1969
02:11:16,293 --> 02:11:17,360
That's good, right?

1970
02:11:17,427 --> 02:11:19,197
We did it, right?

1971
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:22,632
Shit! Shit!

1972
02:11:22,699 --> 02:11:25,769
Oh, did it work, Mikey?
Did it work?

1973
02:11:27,838 --> 02:11:31,374
Tell them why your silly
little ritual didn't work.

1974
02:11:32,609 --> 02:11:34,377
Tell them
it's all just a...

1975
02:11:34,444 --> 02:11:36,246
What's the word, Eds?

1976
02:11:36,313 --> 02:11:37,581
Gazebo?

1977
02:11:38,849 --> 02:11:40,484
Mike, what's
he talking about?

1978
02:11:40,550 --> 02:11:41,718
Mikey?

1979
02:11:43,253 --> 02:11:48,025
Oh, Mikey, you never showed
them the fourth side, did you?

1980
02:11:49,559 --> 02:11:50,995
Didn't want them to know

1981
02:11:51,062 --> 02:11:53,998
what actually happened to
the poor Shokopiwah?

1982
02:11:54,065 --> 02:11:56,333
<i>Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.</i>

1983
02:12:04,841 --> 02:12:07,111
Fuck, Mikey.
You lied to us, again?

1984
02:12:07,178 --> 02:12:10,313
No,
but they didn't believe!

1985
02:12:10,380 --> 02:12:11,615
They didn't believe
they could kill It!

1986
02:12:11,681 --> 02:12:13,017
That's why it didn't
work back then!

1987
02:12:13,084 --> 02:12:14,351
Are you fucking kidding
me, Mike?

1988
02:12:14,417 --> 02:12:15,953
- We hurt him.
- Fuck!

1989
02:12:16,020 --> 02:12:17,554
Fuck you, Mikey.

1990
02:12:17,621 --> 02:12:20,657
I needed something,
anything, for us to remember.

1991
02:12:20,724 --> 02:12:22,226
Anything for us
to believe!

1992
02:12:22,292 --> 02:12:23,393
- God damn it!
- Fuck!

1993
02:12:32,402 --> 02:12:33,470
The Deadlights!

1994
02:12:33,537 --> 02:12:34,906
Don't look at them!

1995
02:12:39,944 --> 02:12:41,545
For 27 years,

1996
02:12:42,479 --> 02:12:45,950
I dreamt of you.

1997
02:12:47,185 --> 02:12:49,486
I craved you.

1998
02:12:49,553 --> 02:12:52,156
Oh, I've
missed you!

1999
02:12:52,223 --> 02:12:54,158
Mike! Move back!

2000
02:12:54,225 --> 02:12:58,328
Waiting for
this very moment.

2001
02:12:58,395 --> 02:13:00,898
Mikey!
You gotta move, Mikey!

2002
02:13:00,965 --> 02:13:02,699
- Sorry. I'm sorry, guys.
- Mike, come on, man!

2003
02:13:02,766 --> 02:13:04,135
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

2004
02:13:04,202 --> 02:13:06,603
Time to float!

2005
02:13:09,207 --> 02:13:10,740
- Oh, shit!
- Sorry.

2006
02:13:12,910 --> 02:13:14,611
Mike, come on, get up!
Get him up!

2007
02:13:14,678 --> 02:13:16,513
- Go, go!
- Run!

2008
02:13:16,580 --> 02:13:18,916
- Oh, shit!
- Run! Go, go, go!

2009
02:13:29,227 --> 02:13:30,660
Go, go, go!

2010
02:13:34,866 --> 02:13:35,900
Go!

2011
02:13:49,113 --> 02:13:50,614
Go, go, go!

2012
02:13:54,952 --> 02:13:55,953
Where'd he go?

2013
02:13:56,020 --> 02:13:57,154
Don't worry.
We'll find a way out.

2014
02:14:18,842 --> 02:14:20,477
- Oh, shit!
- Can he see us?

2015
02:14:21,511 --> 02:14:22,846
Oh, my God!

2016
02:14:22,914 --> 02:14:23,981
Shit.

2017
02:14:24,781 --> 02:14:26,449
Oh, shit.

2018
02:14:26,516 --> 02:14:28,618
Holy shit!
Holy shit! Run!

2019
02:14:28,685 --> 02:14:30,187
Oh, shit!

2020
02:14:31,856 --> 02:14:33,456
Shit.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

2021
02:14:39,629 --> 02:14:40,830
We're trapped.

2022
02:14:40,898 --> 02:14:42,666
Where do we go?

2023
02:15:11,661 --> 02:15:13,663
- God damn it!
- Uh...

2024
02:15:13,730 --> 02:15:15,933
All right.
"Not Scary At All." All right?

2025
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:16,867
No, no, no.

2026
02:15:16,934 --> 02:15:18,601
Wait. Why?

2027
02:15:18,668 --> 02:15:20,438
They're flipped.
He's fucking with us.

2028
02:15:20,503 --> 02:15:22,672
- Are you sure? Positive?
- Trust me.

2029
02:15:22,739 --> 02:15:24,041
- Yes!
- Okay.

2030
02:15:28,645 --> 02:15:29,880
Where's my shoe?

2031
02:15:42,759 --> 02:15:45,062
What the fuck?
You told me to trust you!

2032
02:15:47,398 --> 02:15:48,565
He's not
fucking with us.

2033
02:15:48,631 --> 02:15:49,766
Let's go to
"Not Scary At All."

2034
02:15:49,833 --> 02:15:51,135
Okay.

2035
02:15:57,041 --> 02:15:59,043
It's all right.
Let's go.

2036
02:16:01,312 --> 02:16:02,947
Oh, shit.

2037
02:16:05,116 --> 02:16:06,917
No way am I falling
for this shit again.

2038
02:16:06,984 --> 02:16:09,420
Oh, yeah.
That thing's a fucking monster.

2039
02:16:09,487 --> 02:16:10,720
Richie, make it sit.

2040
02:16:10,787 --> 02:16:13,290
I know your moves,
you little bitch.

2041
02:16:15,926 --> 02:16:16,927
Rich?

2042
02:16:17,627 --> 02:16:18,963
It's gone, man.

2043
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Yeah. Wait.
- Oh. Okay.
Okay.
Sit.
He did it.

2044
02:16:27,004 --> 02:16:28,372
Oh, that's cute.

2045
02:16:28,439 --> 02:16:30,174
- That's a good boy.
- That's actually super cute.

2046
02:16:30,241 --> 02:16:31,541
That's a good boy.

2047
02:16:31,608 --> 02:16:32,977
- Are you a good boy?
- Good boy.

2048
02:16:38,015 --> 02:16:39,283
Shit!

2049
02:16:39,350 --> 02:16:41,252
Yo, next time,
we just go with regular "Scary."

2050
02:16:41,318 --> 02:16:42,652
Next time?

2051
02:16:55,166 --> 02:16:58,135
I lost it,
Billy.

2052
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:02,173
It just floated off.

2053
02:17:04,841 --> 02:17:07,610
I'm not mad at you.

2054
02:17:09,013 --> 02:17:11,748
It's your fault what
happened, isn't it?

2055
02:17:14,085 --> 02:17:18,122
You weren't really that
sick that morning, were you?

2056
02:17:19,490 --> 02:17:20,723
No.

2057
02:17:22,625 --> 02:17:25,628
I just pretended

2058
02:17:25,695 --> 02:17:28,099
because I didn't want to
play with you.

2059
02:17:31,535 --> 02:17:33,370
I just didn't want to.

2060
02:17:34,572 --> 02:17:37,174
You lied and I died.

2061
02:17:37,942 --> 02:17:41,545
You lied and I died.

2062
02:17:41,611 --> 02:17:44,582
You lied and I died!

2063
02:17:44,647 --> 02:17:47,451
You lied and I died!

2064
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You lied and I died!
It happened because of
me, Georgie. Me.
No, no, no.
It was...

2065
02:18:01,532 --> 02:18:02,600
Lied and died!

2066
02:18:02,665 --> 02:18:04,568
Lied and died!

2067
02:18:04,634 --> 02:18:06,403
Lied and died!

2068
02:18:06,470 --> 02:18:08,539
You lied and I died!

2069
02:18:40,905 --> 02:18:43,840
You in there, you little shit?
I can smell you.

2070
02:18:43,908 --> 02:18:46,343
You smell
just like Lois Lane.

2071
02:18:47,378 --> 02:18:48,546
Here's Johnny!

2072
02:19:28,751 --> 02:19:30,421
All that success,

2073
02:19:30,487 --> 02:19:31,889
all those sit-ups,

2074
02:19:31,956 --> 02:19:33,790
but deep down,
still just

2075
02:19:33,857 --> 02:19:36,793
a little fat, fat,
fatty loser...

2076
02:19:38,229 --> 02:19:41,831
...who always knew
he would die alone.

2077
02:19:48,472 --> 02:19:50,608
- Slut!
- Bev!

2078
02:19:53,577 --> 02:19:54,811
Beverly!

2079
02:19:55,412 --> 02:19:56,846
Bevvie.

2080
02:19:56,914 --> 02:19:59,717
Just open up the door for
me, okay?

2081
02:19:59,782 --> 02:20:01,719
Beverly,
can you hear me?

2082
02:20:03,454 --> 02:20:05,755
Come to Daddy, now.

2083
02:20:05,822 --> 02:20:07,091
Bev, don't listen!

2084
02:20:08,791 --> 02:20:09,994
Bev!

2085
02:20:11,228 --> 02:20:13,230
Are you still
my little girl, Bevvie?

2086
02:20:15,065 --> 02:20:16,900
Beverly, I love you!

2087
02:20:17,868 --> 02:20:19,136
Ben!

2088
02:20:19,203 --> 02:20:21,605
Are you still
my little girl, Bevvie?

2089
02:20:21,672 --> 02:20:23,540
Are you still
my little girl?

2090
02:20:23,607 --> 02:20:24,642
Not anymore!

2091
02:20:27,810 --> 02:20:29,846
You little...

2092
02:20:29,913 --> 02:20:31,814
"Your hair
is winter fire.

2093
02:20:33,284 --> 02:20:35,452
"January embers.

2094
02:20:35,519 --> 02:20:37,321
"My heart...

2095
02:20:40,324 --> 02:20:41,358
"My heart..."

2096
02:20:43,394 --> 02:20:44,395
No!

2097
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:52,069
Ben!

2098
02:20:52,136 --> 02:20:54,505
Ben!

2099
02:21:16,627 --> 02:21:17,928
"January embers."

2100
02:21:19,730 --> 02:21:21,565
"My heart
burns there, too."

2101
02:21:23,434 --> 02:21:24,902
It was you.

2102
02:21:39,849 --> 02:21:41,452
We deserve to die.

2103
02:21:41,518 --> 02:21:42,986
No.

2104
02:21:43,053 --> 02:21:47,191
You were the best big brother
there ever was.

2105
02:21:47,257 --> 02:21:50,027
No! We killed
our little brother!

2106
02:21:51,562 --> 02:21:53,330
He loved you.

2107
02:21:53,397 --> 02:21:55,032
And just because
you didn't want to play

2108
02:21:55,099 --> 02:21:56,367
on a rainy day,

2109
02:21:57,534 --> 02:21:59,203
just one time,

2110
02:22:01,572 --> 02:22:03,574
that does not
make it our fault.

2111
02:22:15,052 --> 02:22:16,553
And it never,

2112
02:22:19,289 --> 02:22:20,924
ever...

2113
02:22:23,627 --> 02:22:24,628
...did.

2114

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2115
02:22:58,929 --> 02:23:00,130
Bill.

2116
02:23:01,698 --> 02:23:03,033
Miss me?

2117
02:23:04,535 --> 02:23:06,303
I know what you are.

2118
02:23:06,370 --> 02:23:07,671
That's why
I'm not afraid.

2119
02:23:14,311 --> 02:23:16,480
Well, I know
what you are.

2120
02:23:18,549 --> 02:23:20,083
A madman.

2121
02:23:26,557 --> 02:23:27,558
Hey, fuckface!

2122
02:23:34,531 --> 02:23:36,200
You wanna play
Truth or Dare?

2123
02:23:36,266 --> 02:23:37,534
Here's a truth.

2124
02:23:37,601 --> 02:23:39,203
You're a sloppy bitch!

2125
02:23:39,269 --> 02:23:40,370
Yeah, that's right!

2126
02:23:40,437 --> 02:23:43,006
Let's dance!
Yippee-ki-yay...

2127
02:24:16,206 --> 02:24:18,475
This kills monsters.

2128
02:24:19,343 --> 02:24:21,345
If you believe it does.

2129
02:24:21,411 --> 02:24:23,213
If you believe it does.

2130
02:24:24,014 --> 02:24:25,516
If you believe it does.

2131
02:24:26,416 --> 02:24:28,118
If you believe it does.

2132
02:24:30,187 --> 02:24:33,156
Beep-beep,
motherfucker!

2133
02:24:51,943 --> 02:24:53,011
Holy shit!

2134
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Rich!
Oh, Rich!
Hey, Rich,
wake up!
Hey.
Yeah, yeah! There he is, buddy!

2135
02:25:04,821 --> 02:25:06,256
Hey, Richie, listen!

2136
02:25:06,323 --> 02:25:07,658
I think
I got him, man!

2137
02:25:09,994 --> 02:25:11,328
I think I killed It!

2138
02:25:11,395 --> 02:25:12,897
I did! I think
I killed It for real!

2139
02:25:17,801 --> 02:25:18,802
Eddie.

2140
02:25:21,572 --> 02:25:22,573
Richie.

2141
02:25:25,776 --> 02:25:26,878
Richie.

2142
02:25:31,748 --> 02:25:32,749
No!

2143
02:25:34,084 --> 02:25:35,319
Eddie.

2144
02:25:36,787 --> 02:25:39,089
Uh-oh!

2145
02:25:40,791 --> 02:25:41,792
No!

2146
02:25:55,039 --> 02:25:56,306
Eddie!

2147
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:04,147
Eds!

2148
02:26:05,016 --> 02:26:07,217
- Eds! Eds!
- Eddie!

2149
02:26:07,284 --> 02:26:08,752
Eds,
come on, man.

2150
02:26:10,320 --> 02:26:11,521
Be careful!
Be careful!

2151
02:26:22,165 --> 02:26:24,501
Come out
and play, Losers!

2152
02:26:26,004 --> 02:26:27,471
He's hurt.
He's hurt really bad.

2153
02:26:27,537 --> 02:26:28,839
We gotta
get him out of here.

2154
02:26:28,906 --> 02:26:30,273
How are we supposed
to do that, Richie?

2155
02:26:34,144 --> 02:26:35,746
I almost killed It.

2156
02:26:37,048 --> 02:26:38,248
The leper.

2157
02:26:39,149 --> 02:26:41,318
My hands
around his throat.

2158
02:26:41,385 --> 02:26:43,587
And I could feel
him choking.

2159
02:26:44,956 --> 02:26:46,757
I made him small.

2160
02:26:52,096 --> 02:26:53,330
He seemed so weak.

2161
02:26:56,166 --> 02:26:57,768
He seemed so weak.

2162
02:26:58,735 --> 02:26:59,770
The Shokopiwah.

2163
02:27:01,405 --> 02:27:02,706
All living things
must abide by

2164
02:27:02,773 --> 02:27:04,274
the laws of the shape
they inhabit.

2165
02:27:05,275 --> 02:27:06,810
Guys!

2166
02:27:06,878 --> 02:27:08,946
There's a passageway.
Through here.

2167
02:27:10,247 --> 02:27:12,349
The tunnel.

2168
02:27:12,416 --> 02:27:14,351
Pennywise has to
make himself small

2169
02:27:14,418 --> 02:27:17,521
to get through the entrance
of the cavern, right?

2170
02:27:17,587 --> 02:27:18,923
Okay, so, if we can get back
there, we can

2171
02:27:18,990 --> 02:27:21,125
- force him down to size.
- Yeah.

2172
02:27:21,191 --> 02:27:24,394
We make him small.
Small enough so we can kill him.

2173
02:27:26,563 --> 02:27:29,934
I can smell
the stink of your fear!

2174
02:27:31,468 --> 02:27:33,470
- Let's go! Go!
- Come on! Come on!

2175
02:27:33,537 --> 02:27:35,338
It's tight. It's tight.
Be careful!

2176
02:27:49,553 --> 02:27:52,857
I need a little rest.
Oh, thanks.

2177
02:27:54,025 --> 02:27:55,625
Hey.

2178
02:27:55,692 --> 02:27:56,727
Hey, Richie?

2179
02:27:56,793 --> 02:27:58,062
I gotta
tell you something.

2180
02:27:58,129 --> 02:27:59,730
What?
What's up, buddy?

2181
02:28:02,900 --> 02:28:03,901
I fucked your mother.

2182
02:28:08,505 --> 02:28:10,340
Losers out!

2183
02:28:13,144 --> 02:28:14,344
Go. Go!

2184
02:28:25,422 --> 02:28:26,623
Gotcha!

2185
02:28:27,925 --> 02:28:29,493
Whoa!

2186
02:28:29,559 --> 02:28:32,897
You filthy little children.

2187
02:28:34,631 --> 02:28:36,067
You got a plan B, man?
What the hell do we do now?

2188
02:28:36,134 --> 02:28:37,801
You die.
That's what you do.

2189
02:28:38,835 --> 02:28:40,004
Mike?

2190
02:28:42,606 --> 02:28:44,407
There's more than one way
to make someone small.

2191
02:28:46,676 --> 02:28:47,577
Oh!

2192
02:28:47,644 --> 02:28:49,780
Make him
believe that he is.

2193
02:28:49,846 --> 02:28:51,715
- What?
- Make him believe that he is.

2194
02:28:51,782 --> 02:28:55,318
Oh? Me?
Small?

2195
02:28:56,353 --> 02:28:59,422
I am
the Eater of Worlds.

2196
02:28:59,489 --> 02:29:00,690
Not to us,
you're not.

2197
02:29:03,426 --> 02:29:04,828
You're just a clown.

2198
02:29:10,134 --> 02:29:11,501
You're a weak old woman.

2199
02:29:14,337 --> 02:29:17,008
The Eater of Worlds.

2200
02:29:17,074 --> 02:29:18,441
A headless boy!

2201
02:29:20,343 --> 02:29:21,845
Impostor!

2202
02:29:23,313 --> 02:29:24,781
You're a mimic!

2203
02:29:27,051 --> 02:29:28,685
A mimic!

2204
02:29:28,752 --> 02:29:31,588
You're a fucking bully!

2205
02:29:31,655 --> 02:29:33,323
You're just
a fucking clown!

2206
02:29:33,390 --> 02:29:34,524
Eater of Worlds!

2207
02:29:34,591 --> 02:29:36,626
A clown!
A dumb fucking clown!

2208
02:29:37,828 --> 02:29:39,496
Clown!

2209
02:29:41,098 --> 02:29:43,134
A leper!

2210
02:29:43,201 --> 02:29:45,036
You're a clown!

2211
02:29:45,102 --> 02:29:46,369
You're a clown!

2212
02:29:46,436 --> 02:29:47,571
A painting!

2213
02:29:47,637 --> 02:29:48,940
You're a clown!

2214
02:29:49,006 --> 02:29:50,340
I'm not afraid
of you anymore!

2215
02:29:50,407 --> 02:29:53,277
A motherfucking
stupid mummy!

2216
02:29:53,343 --> 02:29:54,544
You're a clown!

2217
02:29:55,980 --> 02:29:57,814
Clown! Clown!

2218
02:29:59,616 --> 02:30:01,953
- Clown!
- Clown!

2219
02:30:02,019 --> 02:30:04,188
You're a fucking clown!

2220
02:30:04,255 --> 02:30:05,622
You're a clown!

2221
02:30:05,689 --> 02:30:07,824
- A stupid mummy!
- Clown!

2222
02:30:09,193 --> 02:30:10,527
Clown, motherfucker!

2223
02:30:10,594 --> 02:30:13,865
I am the Eater of Worlds!

2224
02:30:18,435 --> 02:30:20,437
Clown!

2225
02:30:20,503 --> 02:30:23,107
- Clown!
- You're just a clown! Clown!

2226
02:30:23,174 --> 02:30:25,877
- I am the Eater of Worlds!
- A clown!

2227
02:30:25,943 --> 02:30:27,410
Whoa!

2228
02:30:27,477 --> 02:30:29,579
A clown! A clown!

2229
02:30:31,648 --> 02:30:33,985
No one's
afraid of you.

2230
02:30:34,051 --> 02:30:35,485
No one's scared of you.

2231
02:30:37,088 --> 02:30:39,389
Clown! Clown!

2232
02:30:40,390 --> 02:30:44,095
Clown. Clown. Clown.

2233
02:30:46,529 --> 02:30:48,698
- Clown.
- Clown.

2234
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
A clown.
With a scared,
beating heart.

2235
02:31:42,519 --> 02:31:44,889
Look at you.

2236
02:31:46,290 --> 02:31:51,128
You're all grown up.

2237
02:32:54,492 --> 02:32:55,725
Eddie. Eddie.

2238
02:32:59,397 --> 02:33:01,564
Eddie.
We got Pennywise, man.

2239
02:33:03,666 --> 02:33:04,869
Eddie?

2240
02:33:17,680 --> 02:33:18,883
Richie.

2241
02:33:19,517 --> 02:33:20,750
He's gone.

2242
02:33:20,817 --> 02:33:22,253
He's all right.
No, he's just hurt.

2243
02:33:22,319 --> 02:33:24,654
We gotta get him outta here.
He's hurt. Ben.

2244
02:33:24,721 --> 02:33:26,057
Bill, he's okay.
We gotta get him outta here.

2245
02:33:26,123 --> 02:33:27,124
Bev.

2246
02:33:28,225 --> 02:33:29,692
Richie.

2247
02:33:32,430 --> 02:33:33,730
What?

2248
02:33:33,797 --> 02:33:35,732
Honey, he's dead.

2249
02:33:39,103 --> 02:33:41,338
We have to go. Come on.
Come on, Richie.

2250
02:33:41,405 --> 02:33:42,973
We gotta go.

2251
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:44,741
Come on, buddy. Come on.

2252
02:33:48,611 --> 02:33:49,846
Let him go, man.
Let him go.

2253
02:33:49,914 --> 02:33:51,848
Got it.

2254
02:33:51,916 --> 02:33:54,651
We can still help him, guys!
We can still help him!

2255
02:33:55,652 --> 02:33:56,820
Go! Go! Get up!

2256
02:33:56,887 --> 02:33:59,090
Guys, we can
still help him!

2257
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:12,870
No! Eddie!

2258
02:34:13,304 --> 02:34:14,771
Eddie!

2259
02:34:19,076 --> 02:34:20,277
Come on!
Let's go!

2260
02:34:25,316 --> 02:34:26,317
Come on! Let's go!

2261
02:34:29,253 --> 02:34:30,254
Move, move!

2262
02:34:36,626 --> 02:34:38,462
- Move, move!
- Run!

2263
02:34:38,529 --> 02:34:39,729
Run!

2264
02:34:53,710 --> 02:34:55,146
- Eddie!
- No, no, no!

2265
02:34:55,212 --> 02:34:56,213
Eddie!

2266
02:34:57,948 --> 02:35:00,317
We gotta get in there
and get him!

2267
02:35:00,384 --> 02:35:02,052
He's still in there!

2268
02:35:12,695 --> 02:35:14,064
Eddie!

2269
02:35:14,565 --> 02:35:15,866
Eddie!

2270
02:36:15,526 --> 02:36:16,961
You know what?

2271
02:36:17,027 --> 02:36:20,197
Eddie would have
hated this, guys.

2272
02:36:20,264 --> 02:36:23,367
What? Cleaning ourselves
in dirty water?

2273
02:36:23,434 --> 02:36:24,902
Yeah.

2274
02:36:24,969 --> 02:36:27,705
He'd be telling us we'd get
streptococcal something.

2275
02:36:27,770 --> 02:36:29,940
Yeah.

2276
02:36:30,007 --> 02:36:31,442
But he would have
made us laugh, though.

2277
02:36:31,508 --> 02:36:33,043
Oh, yeah.

2278
02:36:33,110 --> 02:36:35,079
He'd be
looking out for us.

2279
02:36:36,813 --> 02:36:38,848
The way he always was.

2280
02:36:42,720 --> 02:36:44,521
Ain't that right, Richie?

2281
02:36:47,091 --> 02:36:48,092
Hey.

2282
02:37:18,788 --> 02:37:19,990
Oh.

2283
02:37:20,724 --> 02:37:21,824
Thank you.

2284
02:37:21,892 --> 02:37:23,494
I don't have
my glasses on,

2285
02:37:23,560 --> 02:37:24,728
so I don't know who you people
are, but thank you.

2286
02:37:27,797 --> 02:37:29,433
I legit
can't find my glasses.

2287
02:37:29,500 --> 02:37:30,734
You're serious?

2288
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:32,136
- Glasses?
- Go that way.

2289
02:37:32,202 --> 02:37:33,803
Around here somewhere?

2290
02:37:39,610 --> 02:37:41,245
- I can't see them.
- Oh, I see them. Right there.

2291
02:37:41,312 --> 02:37:43,647
- Where?
- Look. Right...

2292
02:37:43,714 --> 02:37:45,115
If you just go, like...

2293
02:37:45,883 --> 02:37:47,318
Anybody have any luck?

2294
02:38:49,446 --> 02:38:50,447
Hey, guys.

2295
02:38:52,316 --> 02:38:53,384
Look.

2296
02:39:02,993 --> 02:39:04,528
Nothing lasts forever.

2297
02:39:24,948 --> 02:39:26,650
I can't go home
like this, guys.

2298
02:39:27,518 --> 02:39:28,685
My mom will kill me.

2299
02:39:28,752 --> 02:39:31,121
Dude, you've been gone
for 24 straight hours.

2300
02:39:31,188 --> 02:39:33,390
Your face is definitely
on a milk carton by now.

2301
02:39:33,457 --> 02:39:36,026
Also, that puke smells worse
than your mom's slippers.

2302
02:39:36,093 --> 02:39:37,294
Oh, shut up, Richie.

2303
02:39:37,361 --> 02:39:38,796
Okay, first of all,
my mom's slippers

2304
02:39:38,863 --> 02:39:40,764
smell like potpourri, asshole.

2305
02:39:40,831 --> 02:39:42,299
No, they don't.

2306
02:39:42,366 --> 02:39:43,667
Yes, they do.
And, also, how would you know

2307
02:39:43,734 --> 02:39:45,335
what they smell like
in the first place?

2308
02:39:45,402 --> 02:39:46,470
Can we
just keep it quiet,

2309
02:39:46,537 --> 02:39:48,205
please,
until we get home?

2310
02:39:48,272 --> 02:39:49,640
"Potpourri" is
literally a French word

2311
02:39:49,706 --> 02:39:51,375
meaning "rotten pot."

2312
02:39:51,442 --> 02:39:52,342
I knew there
was something rotten about it.

2313
02:40:14,097 --> 02:40:16,366
- Mike?
- <i>Hey.</i>

2314
02:40:16,433 --> 02:40:18,635
I just thought
I'd check up on you.

2315
02:40:18,702 --> 02:40:20,003
You know,
just to see if you learned

2316
02:40:20,070 --> 02:40:21,371
how to finish
a book for once.

2317
02:40:23,607 --> 02:40:25,409
I just finished
the first chapter.

2318
02:40:27,144 --> 02:40:30,681
And I think I actually know
where I'm going this time.

2319
02:40:31,415 --> 02:40:32,349
Good.

2320
02:40:32,416 --> 02:40:34,418
Say, can I ask
you a question?

2321
02:40:34,485 --> 02:40:35,652
<i>Sure.</i>

2322
02:40:37,187 --> 02:40:39,089
Why do you think
we're not forgetting?

2323
02:40:39,990 --> 02:40:41,893
You know, like last time?

2324
02:40:41,960 --> 02:40:43,694
Maybe 'cause It's dead.

2325
02:40:46,898 --> 02:40:48,265
Or maybe 'cause
we have more

2326
02:40:48,332 --> 02:40:50,801
we want to remember
than we want to forget.

2327
02:40:50,869 --> 02:40:52,402
I like that one.

2328
02:40:56,273 --> 02:40:57,341
You decide
what you want to do?

2329
02:40:57,407 --> 02:40:58,742
<i>About leaving Derry?</i>

2330
02:40:58,809 --> 02:41:01,178
Man, I've been in this cell
for 27 years.

2331
02:41:02,546 --> 02:41:04,114
Just seeing
what It wanted me to.

2332
02:41:07,886 --> 02:41:10,621
I think it's time I saw
the sky for a change.

2333
02:41:11,755 --> 02:41:13,925
<i>Go get it, Mikey.</i>

2334
02:41:13,992 --> 02:41:15,559
Oh, did you get the letter?

2335
02:41:16,793 --> 02:41:18,095
What letter?

2336
02:41:18,161 --> 02:41:20,932
You'll know
when you see it.

2337
02:41:20,999 --> 02:41:23,066
Well, hold on.
I just got the mail.

2338
02:41:23,133 --> 02:41:24,635
<i>We all got one.</i>

2339
02:41:27,237 --> 02:41:28,472
Patricia Uris?

2340
02:41:29,439 --> 02:41:30,440
<i>Just...</i>

2341
02:41:31,608 --> 02:41:32,944
Just read it.

2342
02:41:33,011 --> 02:41:34,111
Okay.

2343
02:41:34,177 --> 02:41:36,413
<i>And call me.
Anytime.</i>

2344
02:41:37,180 --> 02:41:38,482
I will.

2345
02:41:38,549 --> 02:41:39,616
<i>And, Bill,</i>

2346
02:41:45,255 --> 02:41:47,524
I love you, man.

2347
02:41:47,591 --> 02:41:49,326
I love you, too.

2348
02:41:49,393 --> 02:41:51,762
<i>All right.
See you around.</i>

2349
02:42:18,923 --> 02:42:21,291
<i>Dear Losers,</i>

2350
02:42:21,358 --> 02:42:23,327
<i>I know what this must seem like,</i>

2351
02:42:23,393 --> 02:42:25,195
<i>but this isn't
a suicide note.</i>

2352
02:42:26,965 --> 02:42:30,667
<i>You're probably wondering
why I did what I did.</i>

2353
02:42:30,734 --> 02:42:33,770
<i>It's because I knew I was
too scared to go back.</i>

2354
02:42:33,837 --> 02:42:35,839
<i>And if
we weren't together,</i>

2355
02:42:35,907 --> 02:42:39,276
<i>if all of us alive
weren't united,</i>

2356
02:42:39,343 --> 02:42:41,578
<i>I knew we'd all die.</i>

2357
02:42:41,645 --> 02:42:46,017
<i>So, I made
the only logical move.</i>

2358
02:42:46,084 --> 02:42:47,784
<i>I took myself
off the board.</i>

2359
02:42:50,054 --> 02:42:51,655
<i>Did it work?</i>

2360
02:42:53,323 --> 02:42:55,359
<i>Well, if you're reading
this, you know the answer.</i>

2361
02:42:57,694 --> 02:42:59,663
<i>I lived
my whole life afraid.</i>

2362
02:43:01,531 --> 02:43:05,602
<i>Afraid of
what would come next.</i>

2363
02:43:05,669 --> 02:43:07,738
<i>Afraid of what
I might leave behind.</i>

2364
02:43:10,707 --> 02:43:11,742
<i>Don't.</i>

2365
02:43:13,777 --> 02:43:15,880
<i>Be who you want to be.</i>

2366
02:43:17,147 --> 02:43:18,715
<i>Be proud.</i>

2367
02:43:19,449 --> 02:43:21,085
You sleep okay?

2368
02:43:21,151 --> 02:43:22,486
Yeah.

2369
02:43:23,420 --> 02:43:25,455
I had a beautiful dream.

2370
02:43:25,522 --> 02:43:28,358
<i>And if you find
someone worth holding on to,</i>

2371
02:43:29,559 --> 02:43:32,429
<i>never ever let them go.</i>

2372
02:43:41,005 --> 02:43:42,673
<i>Follow your own path.</i>

2373
02:43:47,310 --> 02:43:48,812
<i>Wherever that takes you.</i>

2374
02:43:55,352 --> 02:43:58,488
<i>Think of this letter
as a promise.</i>

2375
02:44:01,491 --> 02:44:03,627
<i>A promise
I'm asking you to make.</i>

2376
02:44:04,862 --> 02:44:05,863
<i>To me.</i>

2377
02:44:07,098 --> 02:44:08,432
<i>To each other.</i>

2378
02:44:10,367 --> 02:44:11,802
<i>An oath.</i>

2379
02:44:15,672 --> 02:44:17,708
<i>See,
the thing about being a Loser</i>

2380
02:44:20,410 --> 02:44:22,479
<i>is you don't have
anything to lose.</i>

2381
02:44:25,149 --> 02:44:27,085
<i>So...</i>

2382
02:44:27,151 --> 02:44:29,087
<i>Be true.</i>

2383
02:44:29,153 --> 02:44:30,353
<i>Be brave.</i>

2384
02:44:31,388 --> 02:44:32,589
<i>Stand.</i>

2385
02:44:33,356 --> 02:44:35,325
<i>Believe.</i>

2386
02:44:35,392 --> 02:44:37,694
<i>And don't ever forget...</i>

2387
02:44:38,829 --> 02:44:40,297
<i>We're Losers,</i>

2388
02:44:41,565 --> 02:44:43,533
<i>and we always will be.</i>

2389
02:44:51,210 --> 02:44:56,210
