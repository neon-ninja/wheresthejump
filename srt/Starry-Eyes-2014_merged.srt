00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:15,543
Hi, welcome to Big Taters.
My name is Sarah.

2
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:18,644
Can I start you guys off with
an order of our freedom tops?

3
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,358
Sarah, you know the
rule about cell phones.

4
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,760
I'm sorry. I just... I was
just checking on something.

5
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,127
Yeah, well check it on your break.

6
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,704
Mario, where has she
been hiding that thing?

7
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,785
Put the car in drive, Charlie.

8
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:01,622
You're here for one reason
and one reason only

9
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,091
because...

10
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,758
You know the lines.
Keep your eyes up.

11
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,933
I stopped going to
church when I was 16.

12
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,634
- So I don't...
- Up, up, up.

13
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:26,474
I really haven't been able
to take my eyes off of Erin.

14
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:30,243
The word on the street there's a
rumor going around that she's...

15
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:34,115
...bicycle but sadly I'm
sitting here realizing

16
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,916
that I've never gone
to take a ride...

17
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,785
Oh, hi, how are you? Good to see you.

18
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,105
- Hey, Sarah. Nice to see you.
- Hello. How's it going?

19
00:03:41,206 --> 00:03:42,690
- I'm glad you came.
- Fine. Yeah.

20
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,861
And I'm glad you brought
your wonderful roommate.

21
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:50,562
- Suck it, Danny.
- I said you were wonderful.

22
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:59,807
- You coming?
- Hey, I honestly don't know what it is.

23
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,143
Oh, don't be coy. You're coming.

24
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,812
Yeah, come, and I'll tell you
all about my new project.

25
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,882
Yeah, it's really good. We've been
working on it for like the last two,

26
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:09,776
- three months now.
- Cool.

27
00:04:09,877 --> 00:04:12,586
I'm playing Simone. She has the
best lines in the whole thing.

28
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:18,726
I've been writing it and Erin has been
providing some very insightful feedback.

29
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:21,629
I am honestly actually kind
of surprised to see you here.

30
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,797
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- Erin.

31
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:27,699
- Why would you think that?
- Because I "stole your role."

32
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:32,206
Okay, Danny do you want
to help me in the kitchen?

33
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:33,374
Yeah.

34
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:36,810
- I'm kidding, Sarah. Don't worry.
- Okay.

35
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,281
I didn't even know that you auditioned for
it and it was just a stupid commercial.

36
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:42,583
Honestly, it was kind of a
horrible experience anyway.

37
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:46,555
The director was a total perv and you
should be glad that you didn't get it.

38
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,190
- Okay.
- I'm going to get a drink.

39
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,257
- Sarah?
- Yeah.

40
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,892
Oh, my God, Sarah.

41
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,661
- Did you do something with your hair?
- No.

42
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,030
Are you coming to Performation?
You totally have to.

43
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,266
- Everyone's going to perform something.
- Oh, perform?

44
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:03,068
Yeah, we'll finally get to see these acting
chops that we've heard so much about.

45
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,372
Okay.

46
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,242
I like your shoes, Sarah.

47
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:14,515
...I'm no ginko but I am Poe.

48
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:17,578
The Rosebowl's got a table of them.
Hey I had to find the film

49
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,620
- but it works great.
- Oh.

50
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,088
- Here, check this out.
- Oh.

51
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,723
- That's sexy right?
- Yeah.

52
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:26,391
Danny and I are making a dark room
so we can do all the processing.

53
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,462
That's cool.

54
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:31,819
Well, we were going to do a gallery
show but it's just so much easier

55
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,067
to put that shit on Instagram.
It's just a way bigger audience.

56
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,306
Are you kidding me?
Beer on my butt.

57
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,640
- Are you okay?
- Dudes, don't.

58
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,478
Nip slip.

59
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,074
Sarah.

60
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:20,881
- Hey, Sarah, hey you alright?
- Yeah. Yeah.

61
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:24,285
Hey listen, so about this script
that we were talking about earlier,

62
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,955
I was wondering maybe you and I
could get together sometime and...

63
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,524
Oh, my God.

64
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:34,728
- What's going on?
- Oh, this ad for a role.

65
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,821
- They just called me in for an audition.
- What? Really?

66
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:38,387
- That's great. Congratulations.
- No, way, cool.

67
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:39,433
- That's cool.
- Thank you.

68
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,435
What is the role for?

69
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:44,638
It's this movie called
The Silver Scream.

70
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,006
Oh, my God. I hope
that's a working title.

71
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,043
- What?
- It's really cool.

72
00:06:58,415 --> 00:07:03,287
Chloe did not get fed
up and just take off.

73
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:07,028
She's not out on another one of her,

74
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,897
benders.

75
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:12,433
She's not out on another
one of her benders.

76
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,568
Something happened to her.

77
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:19,207
I, I went to her...

78
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,706
I... I...

79
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:26,979
I went over to her trailer and I...

80
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,518
Sorry.

81
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,124
I, I went to...

82
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,727
I...

83
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,394
I went to...

84
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,230
I...

85
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,707
Oh, oh, God.

86
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,749
I'm... I'm...

87
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,362
Sarah Walker.

88
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,102
I'm Sarah Walker.

89
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,243
I'm Sarah Walker.

90
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,310
Hi, Sarah.

91
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,582
I brought a headshot.

92
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:12,019
That won't be necessary.
We have your digital file.

93
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:16,387
Yeah, of course. I just thought
you might want a hard copy.

94
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:25,232
What you do in this room right now will
render that headshot null and void.

95
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:30,771
When you exit this room you will
either have made a lasting impression

96
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:36,509
or blend into the sea of thousands of
forgotten girls who pass through these halls

97
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,309
every day.

98
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,352
A photograph won't change that.

99
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,495
Okay.

100
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:59,566
Well, hopefully you'll see something in
me because I know I'd be great for this.

101
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:05,106
I grew up on scary movies
and I'm an actor obviously.

102
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,777
So I, I think I'd be pretty good.

103
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:13,881
Don't tell us, Sarah. Show us.

104
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:38,732
Chloe didn't get fed up with
the shoot and just take off.

105
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:40,333
She's not out there on
one of her benders.

106
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:43,003
- Something happened to her.
- Happened to her, like what?

107
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:47,273
I went to her trailer after everyone
said that she took off and I found this.

108
00:10:47,373 --> 00:10:50,944
- And?
- Her dad gave her this, Chaz.

109
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:53,446
On the morning of her birthday
before he left for work

110
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:56,123
- when he still lived in Long Island.
- So?

111
00:10:56,223 --> 00:11:00,794
So her birthday is September 11. Her dad
died that morning in the World Trade Center.

112
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,776
She would never leave without this.

113
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:05,399
- No way, not ever.
- Okay, so she wouldn't leave without it.

114
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,266
I mean, that still doesn't
mean something happened.

115
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:13,029
Well, that's not all.
When I was in her trailer

116
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,843
I-I heard a shuffling and then I saw
something out of the corner of my eye.

117
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,313
Don't say it. Don't tell me you're
believing these stories now too.

118
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,448
I turned. I saw her, Chaz.

119
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,050
- Saw who?
- Chloe.

120
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,119
So she's still here.

121
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,162
It was her...

122
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:31,822
only it wasn't.

123
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:39,631
- Thank you, Sarah.
- No problem.

124
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,467
We'll be in touch.

125
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,241
Okay.

126
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,948
Do you have any notes for me?

127
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,651
I can do it again, different if
you didn't like what you saw.

128
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,719
We saw what we needed,
Sarah. Thank you.

129
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:32,217
Fuck. Fuck. God. Fuck.

130
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,668
Fuck!

131
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,768
God!

132
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

133
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:06,678
Maybe we didn't see all we
needed from you after all.

134
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,919
What was that you were doing
in the washroom, Sarah?

135
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,522
What?

136
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,388
Your fit.

137
00:14:19,657 --> 00:14:22,794
That... that was nothing.

138
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,967
Sarah, you have my attention.

139
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:38,813
- I was disappointed in myself.
- So you punished yourself.

140
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:44,117
No, I don't... It's just something
I do. I don't know.

141
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:48,889
Would you do it again, for us, now?

142
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:54,027
- What?
- I want to see your fit, Sarah.

143
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:57,230
I've never done that in
front of anyone before.

144
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,731
Alright then,
thank you for coming in.

145
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

146
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,924
Thank you, Sarah. We'll be in touch.

147
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,671
Hey, how'd it go?

148
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,977
How did the audition go?
What happened?

149
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:29,249
Not good. I think
they made fun of me.

150
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,251
What?

151
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,620
I don't really want to
talk about it right now.

152
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,422
Okay, well, hey,
everyone's coming by in a little bit.

153
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,658
You should come hang out with us.

154
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:43,294
I kind of want to be alone. Thanks.

155
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,363
Our little tater tot
full of birthing cheer,

156
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:21,465
our little tater tot
has lived another year.

157
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,136
I love birthdays.

158
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,844
Again with the phone, Sarah?
Am I going to have to start frisking you?

159
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,354
David, what are you doing
standing there staring at me?

160
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:45,291
I told you to go defrost those
chicken strips like an hour ago.

161
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,127
They're like a block of ice.

162
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,627
Jesus Christ.

163
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:54,968
Hi, this is Sarah Walker calling
you back. You just called me.

164
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,937
Hello Sarah. Yes, we tried to call...

165
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,716
Yes, yeah, I'm so sorry about that.

166
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:02,609
- I was...
- Please don't cut me off, Sarah.

167
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,443
We'd like to see you again.

168
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:11,217
Yes, yeah, yeah, I would...
I would love to come in again.

169
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,120
Great. I'll e-mail you the details.

170
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,524
And Sarah, this will be
different from the last time.

171
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:23,094
Oh, well good because I only
have so much hair on my head.

172
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,644
Well, thank you. Thank you so much

173
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:32,269
- and I'm sorry that I cut you off...
- Yeah.

174
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,483
Jeez.

175
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,856
What's going on with you lately?

176
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,959
Listen, Sarah,

177
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,428
Tater's girls are all family.

178
00:19:55,528 --> 00:20:00,768
So, if one of you isn't on the ball
then that affects the whole family.

179
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:06,006
You would never want to hurt your
family now, would you, Sarah?

180
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:11,044
- I don't really have a family, Carl.
- I'm talking about your Big Tater's family,

181
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:15,615
the phone thing, all these
auditions that you're going on.

182
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,820
I know it's important to you but...
this is your job.

183
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,354
You got to prioritize.

184
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:30,461
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- I know that I am.

185
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,665
I think I may have to quit.

186
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,590
No, I don't... You didn't understand
what I was trying to say.

187
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:45,754
This job is getting in the way,
Carl. I have a talent,

188
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:49,949
a real talent and I'm not going
to take that for granted anymore.

189
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:54,420
Now that's... You... You're twisting my
words around and that's not what I meant.

190
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,191
Let me... Let's... Let's start over.

191
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:01,127
You have a gift. No.

192
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,463
This. This place.

193
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:10,301
Sarah, there are a million other girls who
would beg for a steady job like this.

194
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:16,040
I am not a million other girls.

195
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,398
You can go right in.

196
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:47,671
Close the door behind you.

197
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:57,514
Step forward please.

198
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,986
Stand right on that pink mark.

199
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's so dark.

200
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:13,931
Lower your hand.

201
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,372
Thank you for seeing us again, Sarah.

202
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:22,742
Of course, yeah,
this is my top priority.

203
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:27,213
Today we'd like to try
something different with you.

204
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:30,483
Of course. Sure, I...
I didn't get any...

205
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:34,454
- Would you mind disrobing for us?
- Excuse me?

206
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,689
Would you mind disrobing, please?

207
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:47,200
The ad didn't say anything about nudity.
Does the role call for that?

208
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,402
It doesn't.

209
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:53,239
Sarah, you've already proven
that you can memorize lines.

210
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:57,744
Now we need to see you bare.
Let your inhibitions go.

211
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,379
Didn't I do that last time?

212
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:06,016
That's the reason you're here Sarah,
the only reason you got a call back.

213
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,722
Sarah, you know who we are.

214
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,590
You know the pictures
we've made, yes?

215
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:03,474
Completely, Sarah.

216
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

217
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:41,378
It's okay, Sarah. I told you
this would be different.

218
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,852
Sarah,

219
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,919
relax yourself.

220
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:55,561
Sarah, if you can't
fully let yourself go,

221
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,729
how can you ever transform
into something else?

222
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

223
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:01,058
That's what we were looking for,
Sarah. Thank you.

224
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,127
Okay, okay. Here we go.

225
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,230
One, two, three.

226
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:44,570
If I have to take one more goddamn
photo of you two idiots jumping,

227
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,637
I swear to God I'm
going to kill myself.

228
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:55,248
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey.

229
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:56,416
Hey, how'd it go?

230
00:26:56,516 --> 00:27:01,253
- Tracy told us that you had a callback.
- Oh, yeah, they wanted to see me again.

231
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,555
Yeah, I read the ad. The role
seemed a little silly though.

232
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,462
Yeah, but it's Astreus
Pictures so it's legit.

233
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:12,965
It's Astreus? Wow, that is legit.
They're the real deal.

234
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:15,301
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Good job.

235
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:18,471
Don't you think it's kind
of a long shot, though?

236
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,307
What's Extra, Extraneous...?

237
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,576
- Astre... Astreus Pictures.
- Astreus. It's stupid.

238
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:26,479
They're a production company.
They've been around forever.

239
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:31,083
Fell off a little last few years
but they're coming back?

240
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,652
Maybe you can put in
a word with production,

241
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,888
get a little PA work or something?

242
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:40,290
- What about our film?
- We're still going to make our film.

243
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,196
Well, I haven't gotten
the role yet. So...

244
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,096
That's true.

245
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,275
- Oh, Trace.
- Hey. Hey.

246
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,511
- How'd it go?
- Great. I think it went great.

247
00:27:58,611 --> 00:27:59,328
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

248
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,347
You didn't feel like they were
making fun of you this time?

249
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:04,583
No, you know what, I don't think they
were making fun of me the first time either.

250
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,853
- Oh, okay. Awesome.
- Yeah.

251
00:28:06,953 --> 00:28:08,788
- Anyway, I don't want to jinx it.
- Of course.

252
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:10,039
- You and your superstitions.
- Yeah.

253
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:12,389
Hey, you should go throw on a
bathing suit and come join us.

254
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:14,160
Oh, shit.

255
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,159
Yo, Erin, Erin.

256
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,570
Shit.

257
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,338
Ashley, here.

258
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:30,074
Here, here. Here, you're okay.
You're okay. You're okay...

259
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,716
Sarah, if you can't really let yourself go
how can you transform into something else?

260
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:08,348
- Hello?
- I have some good news for you, Sarah.

261
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,983
He wants to meet you.

262
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,085
He, who?

263
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,252
The producer.

264
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:25,062
Oh, my God.

265
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:45,749
...this is your moment.
Oh, man.

266
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,457
- I don't know what this is.
- Jesus Christ, can we not watch another one.

267
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:52,992
- Wait, wait, just...
- Do you know who wrote this?

268
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:54,627
Watch what he does.

269
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:57,630
I'm not trying to be rude
but this is fucking stupid.

270
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,665
Oh, yeah.

271
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:01,300
That guy rocks.

272
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,068
Do you know how many times I've
wanted to do that? It's crazy.

273
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,349
Wow.

274
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:23,088
- That's right, you have that thing.
- What thing?

275
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:26,256
She's got a meeting
with the producer.

276
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,929
- At Astreus?
- Yeah.

277
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:32,064
I told you you'd get it.

278
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,433
Don't you think you're
a little overdressed?

279
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,670
- This? This is nothing.
- It's a little much.

280
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:42,239
Look, you look amazing.
Go kick some ass.

281
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,512
Just remember to be yourself in here.

282
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,898
Sarah,

283
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:47,170
- thank you for coming.
- Thank you for having me.

284
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:56,982
You're just as beautiful in person
as you are on the audition tapes.

285
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:00,417
Thank you. I didn't realize
I was being taped.

286
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:04,656
Well, I am excited, Sarah.

287
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:09,228
We audition a lot of young
women in this building

288
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:13,532
but very, very few ever
make it to this room.

289
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,435
Wow, that's great.

290
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:19,671
Yes, we've had our share of winners,

291
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:24,076
some pretty big names have
passed right through here,

292
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,543
going way back.

293
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:32,851
So, did you like our little yarn?

294
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,155
Absolutely, I loved it.
I read it three times.

295
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:40,325
Good. I have high hopes
for this picture.

296
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:46,132
Yes. It's kind of my love
letter to this town.

297
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:52,671
Ambition, the blackest
of human desires.

298
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:57,509
Everyone has it.
But how many act on it?

299
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,578
That's what intrigues me.

300
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:03,749
That's what lights me up as they say.

301
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:06,485
There's something primal they're

302
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:10,289
and that's why you're sitting
right here in this room.

303
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:15,027
- But I mean, it's a horror movie as well.
- Of course.

304
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,564
The two are not mutually exclusive.

305
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:24,202
This industry is a plague Sarah,
a plague of unoriginality,

306
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:27,639
hollow be thy name,
shallow be thy name.

307
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,809
Yes, it's a plague alright.

308
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:34,847
And what does every
plague have a lot of?

309
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:37,082
- Rats?
- Precisely.

310
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:40,252
Yes, thousands of them,
hungry little rats,

311
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,387
hungry for the cheese.

312
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:46,492
You cut through the fog of this town

313
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:48,994
and you get desperation,

314
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:54,967
plastic parishioners worshiping
their deity of debauchery.

315
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:57,803
But that's what I find
interesting, Sarah.

316
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:02,107
That's what I want
to capture in this film,

317
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:06,745
the ugliness of the human spirit.

318
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:10,483
Yeah, okay, I mean, I can see that.

319
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:14,386
So why do you do it, darling?

320
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,256
Why, why do I do what?

321
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:21,057
Why do you pull your
beautiful hair out?

322
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:29,001
I... It's just a habit.

323
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:32,503
I started doing it when
I was a little girl and...

324
00:34:34,003 --> 00:34:36,909
it helps me focus on the moment.

325
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:39,111
The moment.

326
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:43,081
- Well, this is a moment.
- Yes, yes it is.

327
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,884
The role of Celeste
is a really big deal

328
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:49,922
for a young actress with no
other credits to her name.

329
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:53,585
Your face will be on the poster.
The poster on a wall,

330
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:57,729
a wall in the lobby,
a lobby of a movie theater,

331
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:01,600
a theater with a marquee,

332
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,803
The Silver Scream.

333
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:09,141
Now you know that doesn't happen
very much anymore, right?

334
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,444
This is a great opportunity
for a young actress,

335
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:16,882
a great opportunity for
an actress with ambition.

336
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:22,387
That's me. I'm your girl. I will do
whatever it takes for this role.

337
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:27,059
Good, because we want
to offer it to you.

338
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:30,429
We think you could be
great in this role, Sarah.

339
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:33,296
I think you could be
great in this role.

340
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:40,973
I agree. Truthfully,
I think I am this role.

341
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:46,612
I mean, this character has a dream
and she has so much potential.

342
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:50,482
Sarah, forget about all that.

343
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,952
This world is about the doers,

344
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:56,888
the people who don't just talk
about what they're going to do,

345
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,724
they just do it. And that's you.

346
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:07,132
Thank you. Thank you for saying that.

347
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:10,636
I worked so hard, you know.

348
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:12,871
Every week is a new class,

349
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:16,740
a new audition and I just never...

350
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:27,383
If you want me to...
to read more with...

351
00:36:28,284 --> 00:36:30,022
other actors,

352
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:34,426
or another audition.

353
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:39,531
Sarah, this is the audition.

354
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,768
I told you before,

355
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:47,339
very, very few actresses
ever get to this room.

356
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:51,009
Sarah, you're at the gates.

357
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:55,614
All you need is for me
to open them for you.

358
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,750
I can make you a star, Sarah.

359
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,718
- You know I can.
- Whoa, no.

360
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,856
Let me out.

361
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:10,894
Let me out. Open the door.

362
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,190
How'd it go?

363
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,259
Not good.

364
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:44,162
- Maybe I should submit my headshot.
- Seriously.

365
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,964
I'm kidding.

366
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,200
- Are you all right?
- Oh, honey, I'm kidding.

367
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,366
Hey.

368
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,203
- Maybe you should...
- Yeah.

369
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,905
It was a fucking joke.

370
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:59,843
Coming in.

371
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:11,154
What are you doing? Hey,

372
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,226
don't cry, hun.

373
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:19,431
What happened?

374
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:23,001
Everything was going so well.

375
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:26,338
I was so sure I was going to get it.

376
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:29,508
I quit my job for this.

377
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,010
You quit your job for this?

378
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,614
I was so sure. I was so sure.

379
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:39,384
Okay, wait a minute, what happened?

380
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:43,088
It was one final step

381
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:48,691
and I could have had it
too if I was just willing to...

382
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:53,663
Hun, willing to what?

383
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:59,605
Come on, you don't...
You don't mean sex.

384
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:02,741
I mean, he didn't say
specifically what.

385
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,677
Oh, my God.

386
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:07,679
Are you being serious?

387
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:12,051
What a fucking creep, okay.
Do people still even do that?

388
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:15,287
Well, no one out there does.

389
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:17,656
And I sure as heck don't.

390
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:21,325
And you don't. Okay?

391
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,998
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

392
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,866
Wait,

393
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:33,839
you don't wish that
you did it do you?

394
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,210
It was a gateway part.

395
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,279
Sarah, it was two auditions.

396
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,249
I mean, and seriously, who gets
hired for a lead role that quickly?

397
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:47,050
Doesn't that seem a
little suspicious to you?

398
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:54,025
Listen, Danny was just telling me how
badly he wants to have you in his movie.

399
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,427
You should talk to him.

400
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:56,859
Oh, shut up.

401
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,364
What are they up to now?

402
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:16,581
I can make you a star, Sarah.

403
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:19,315
You know I can.

404
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:31,096
So I just wanted to
say that I'm sorry.

405
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,766
I know that you were
trying to help me

406
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:38,637
and I twisted your words.

407
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:42,705
I twisted them and...

408
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:47,412
Look, Sarah, I get it.

409
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:51,483
Really, I do. I'm not an idiot.

410
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,017
I know what town we live in.

411
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,722
I mean, you think you're the
first waitress I've ever had

412
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,358
that was destined for stardom?
I've had my share.

413
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,694
But they all understood
that being a Taters girl

414
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,398
is what paid the bills while
they chased the dream.

415
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:10,867
Now I'm not sure you see
how the two are connected.

416
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:17,943
I mean, I don't know what
else you want me to say.

417
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:21,546
Do you want me to beg for this job?

418
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,349
Well, you don't got to be a jerk about it.
I mean, I've already had like,

419
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:27,400
- 20 applications since you quit, so...
- I'm sorry. I didn't...

420
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:29,589
I didn't mean it like that.

421
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:36,229
Look, I want you to see this
place for what it really is.

422
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:40,632
Yeah, I know you think it's cheesy.

423
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:43,902
Too self-aware,
not ironic enough for you,

424
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,505
the menus, the specials,
all those clever meal names,

425
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,341
calling the little kids tater tots,

426
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:53,678
saying see you later tater gator
when the customers are leaving.

427
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:57,983
That's all me. All right?

428
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:03,538
It may not be cool to a
young woman your age

429
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:06,659
- but it's me.
- Okay.

430
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,070
Look, just...

431
00:42:10,871 --> 00:42:14,165
promise me that until your star
is on the sidewalk out there

432
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:19,105
you'll try and value me and
what I'm trying to do here.

433
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,438
Can you...

434
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:25,775
Can you do that for me?

435
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:30,046
Are you a Taters girl?

436
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,350
Yeah, I can do that.

437
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:40,790
I'm a Taters girl.

438
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:03,748
I guess my point is that I just feel
like, the austerity lifestyles,

439
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:06,449
sort of eastern lifestyles exists...

440
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:14,359
I got no friends at my party.

441
00:43:14,459 --> 00:43:17,929
Hey. Back to slumming
it like the rest of us?

442
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:19,495
Hey.

443
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:21,566
Hey.

444
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,735
- What's up, Erin?
- Hi.

445
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:25,368
What's up?

446
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:29,105
Do you have like, an amp for that?

447
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,049
This is good.

448
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,238
Who knows how to scat?

449
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:48,526
This is the issue with the millennial
generation. It's just, it's entitlement.

450
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,341
Hey, you get off my lawn.

451
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,878
It's my property you're sitting on.

452
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:10,349
You're loitering. I could
have you arrested.

453
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:14,851
It's a crime. It's where I live.

454
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:19,190
- You live there?
- Yeah.

455
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,426
Why?

456
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:24,095
See, it's LA.

457
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:26,765
Why should I spend $1500
a month on an apartment

458
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:30,702
when I'm just going to spend
all day in the car anyway?

459
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:34,972
- So this is your car too?
- It's my car. It doesn't run but...

460
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:37,206
it did when I had that epiphany.

461
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:53,492
Tracy told us what happened.

462
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:56,861
Told you, told you what?

463
00:44:56,961 --> 00:45:02,932
That the producer at
Astreus got inappropriate.

464
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:09,138
Maybe it's worth it.

465
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:16,281
I just started back up
at Big Taters yesterday.

466
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,883
I kind of feel like I'm
selling my soul already.

467
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:22,585
So it may as well be
for something I love.

468
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:30,595
I don't know. If you want to do
what you love, why not just do it?

469
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:35,367
I mean, you work at this restaurant.
You work at Big Taters. I live in a van.

470
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:37,470
So what?

471
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:43,539
Those things aren't mutually exclusive from
us being able to do what we want to do.

472
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:48,948
We got all these people,
all our friends,

473
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:52,550
they're just sitting around
trying to figure out what to do,

474
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,687
trying to figure out how to make something.
Maybe we should be sitting around anymore.

475
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:59,922
Maybe we should just get
together and make something.

476
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:07,532
I'm going to send you my script.

477
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:10,499
You're going to dig it, trust me.

478
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:16,639
And we'll work around your
precious Big Taters schedule.

479
00:46:20,845 --> 00:46:23,215
You'd direct me?

480
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:25,248
Yeah.

481
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,587
I'd be your leading lady?

482
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:31,189
I say rape, you say don't.

483
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,356
- Sure.
- Simone?

484
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:40,596
If you want.

485
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:46,235
Then, yeah.

486
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:51,607
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I'll be in your movie.

487
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:55,880
Alright, okay.

488
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,116
I've been trying to talk to
you about it for a week.

489
00:46:58,216 --> 00:47:01,787
Fuck Astreus Pictures.
We're going to make our own movie.

490
00:47:02,387 --> 00:47:04,520
All right?

491
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:07,456
Do you have any champagne?

492
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:12,561
Okay. Hold on.

493
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,178
What is it?

494
00:47:32,784 --> 00:47:35,618
It's the start of the night
we're never going to forget.

495
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:48,764
Three, two, one.

496
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:19,857
This world is about the doers,

497
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:25,130
the people who don't just talk about what
they're going to do, they just do it.

498
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,296
And that's you.

499
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:33,938
Astreus Pictures.

500
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:37,409
Hi, this is Sarah Walker calling.

501
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:41,642
I made a mistake. I never
should have left that office.

502
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:47,149
I want to meet him again.

503
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:07,102
582 Canyon Drive.
Be there in one hour.

504
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:23,045
Come in, Sarah.

505
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:47,136
There won't be a third
opportunity, Sarah.

506
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,761
Your house is beautiful.

507
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:18,901
Do you want me to read a scene?

508
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,378
Do you want to discuss
the role some more?

509
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

510
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:46,029
I'm sorry that I left
the other night. I'm...

511
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:51,900
I'm... I... I really could
be great for this part.

512
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:58,743
Words, Sarah, just words.

513
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:03,481
What would you be willing
to do to convince me,

514
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:07,084
to make me believe in you again?

515
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:12,189
Would you forgo your eyes
for a new pair of eyes,

516
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:15,459
eyes that see with our vision?

517
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,429
Would you give up your body

518
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,466
to become a vessel for our voice,

519
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,303
for my voice?

520
00:53:25,403 --> 00:53:32,708
Will you give your old life
away for a glorious, new life?

521
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,746
Yes.

522
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:41,817
Then show me.

523
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:31,402
The gateway is opened, Sarah.

524
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:38,075
All you have to do is be willing
to step inside forever

525
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:41,243
and never look back.

526
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:45,285
Kill your old life, Sarah.

527
00:54:46,085 --> 00:54:49,193
Bury it in the earth

528
00:54:49,594 --> 00:54:54,158
and join us in the skies.

529
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Show me the girl I thought you were.

530
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,609
Let me see the real, Sarah.

531
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,875
Sarah, order's up.

532
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:28,183
Oh, Jesus Christ, Sarah.

533
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,256
Go home. You shouldn't
be here right now.

534
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:34,859
No, no, it's... I'm fine. It's fine.

535
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:39,396
It's not fine. What are you doing?
Come here. Come on. Come on.

536
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,599
Come on, come on.
Give me it. Give me it.

537
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:44,533
Give me that. Give me it.
Give me it. Give me it.

538
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:57,179
Get the fuck out of here
and don't come back.

539
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:09,191
Astreus Pictures.

540
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:12,229
This is Sarah Walker calling.

541
00:57:16,129 --> 00:57:18,836
I'm not feeling very well.

542
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:21,705
I mean, I'm fine.

543
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,942
It's fine. I just...

544
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:29,313
I don't... I don't know
what's happening right now.

545
00:57:29,413 --> 00:57:33,415
So if someone could...

546
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:41,359
If someone could please call me
back when you get this, please.

547
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,259
Thank you.

548
00:57:56,674 --> 00:57:58,273
Are you okay?

549
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,476
Are you alright?

550
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:07,351
Hey, Sarah, you alright?
Let me look at you. Come here.

551
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:10,786
Hey, are you okay?
You alright, Sarah?

552
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:16,794
- Danny, get drunk with me.
- I'm alright right now, man.

553
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:18,696
But I love you. I love you very much.

554
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:21,565
Suit yourself but we won't be able
to sneak booze into the bowl.

555
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:26,704
It easy to sneak booze in. All you have
to do is flirt with the dude at the door.

556
00:58:26,804 --> 00:58:29,971
Oh. Yeah, yeah,
I'll give that a shot.

557
00:58:31,308 --> 00:58:32,474
Dude.

558
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,479
She's going to Ralph.

559
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,815
Hey, I think maybe we
need to get her home.

560
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:40,785
Get her like some water or something.

561
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:44,788
- Yo, Poe, put that away.
- No, no, no, this is golden.

562
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:47,691
I'm going to make a Tumblr. It's going
to be called Sick, slutty Sarah, yeah.

563
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:50,127
No, you're not.
What the fuck are you thinking?

564
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:52,396
- Damn it, leave him alone.
- I love you. It's okay.

565
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:54,031
Give me my fucking phone!

566
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:55,530
- Whoa!
- Jesus.

567
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:00,535
Dude.

568
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:06,641
Sarah? What the... I was
trying to stop him. What...

569
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:09,913
- Okay, what...?
- Let's just keep it funny everybody.

570
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,081
- Relax.
- Am I the bad guy now?

571
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:13,984
- Why are you defending her, Danny?
- Go after her. She's sick.

572
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:15,886
Sarah, you shouldn't go
down there. It's not safe.

573
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:17,254
Go after her. She's going to...

574
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:18,856
She just pushed me.
She's not going to want me to...

575
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:21,289
I mean it. She's obviously
not feeling well.

576
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,572
Astreus Pictures.

577
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,441
Hello?

578
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:42,444
Hello?

579
00:59:48,786 --> 00:59:52,721
I don't feel good. I don't feel...

580
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,528
Hello?!

581
00:59:57,828 --> 01:00:00,195
I did what you asked.

582
01:00:09,673 --> 01:00:11,239
Hey, you okay?

583
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:16,812
How dare you! How dare
you touch me! How dare you!

584
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:34,095
I'm sorry.

585
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:51,184
Sarah, if you can't really let
yourself go how can you ever transform

586
01:00:51,285 --> 01:00:53,751
- into something else?
- You're at the gates.

587
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:58,055
All you need is for me
to open them for you.

588
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:01,625
Maybe we didn't see what we
needed from you after all.

589
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:03,560
Your face would be on the poster,

590
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,064
the poster on the wall,
a wall in a lobby,

591
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,333
the lobby of the movie theater,

592
01:01:09,433 --> 01:01:11,702
a theater with a marquee.

593
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:14,138
They are all losers. Cancer.

594
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:16,874
Kill your old life, Sarah.

595
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:20,009
Bury it in the earth

596
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:25,346
and join us in the skies.

597
01:01:31,288 --> 01:01:35,123
Sarah? You okay?

598
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:38,295
Go away.

599
01:01:38,595 --> 01:01:41,229
Listen, I really need
to get in there.

600
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:48,172
I... Just go away please.

601
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:51,473
You've been in there for like, two hours.
I have to get ready for work.

602
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:16,198
Are you okay?

603
01:02:19,636 --> 01:02:21,503
Sweetie, what...?

604
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:31,048
Do you smell that?

605
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:34,852
I think it's coming from you.

606
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:36,854
Yeah,

607
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:43,493
Sarah, no offense,
but I mean, that's you.

608
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,963
- Are you on your period?
- What?

609
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:48,899
Fuck you. All right,
that's enough, okay.

610
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,035
I've had enough of your shit.
What the hell's going on with you?

611
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,135
You told them.

612
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:56,573
- You told them.
- Who? What?

613
01:02:56,673 --> 01:03:00,278
About my audition. And the producer,

614
01:03:00,879 --> 01:03:02,596
- right?
- It came...

615
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,882
I bet you all got
off on it too, right?

616
01:03:05,182 --> 01:03:08,185
- No.
- Seeing me fail like that?

617
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:11,755
Sarah, those are your friends.
Okay, nobody wanted that for you.

618
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:14,625
They're your friends!
They're your friends!

619
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:17,294
I am trying to do something big.

620
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:21,031
I'm trying to do
something with my life.

621
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:23,500
How am I supposed to do this

622
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,556
when you surround me with these...

623
01:03:26,857 --> 01:03:28,505
losers?

624
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:32,910
Do you hear the words that are
coming out of your mouth right now?

625
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:37,080
They're like venom to me,

626
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:41,785
like, like a cancer, all of
you guys, just all of you.

627
01:03:41,885 --> 01:03:47,190
You and Danny, Erin,
just like, living off of me.

628
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:50,026
Oh, living off of you?

629
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:53,330
Okay, the last time I checked I covered
your rent for the past two months

630
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,405
and I'm guessing you don't
have this month's either because

631
01:03:55,506 --> 01:03:58,568
you're so obsessed with this job
that just wants to fuck you

632
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,836
instead of the job that
actually pays your bills.

633
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,633
What the fuck?

634
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:05,133
Now it's our apartment again. So do
me a favor, Trace, and fuck off!

635
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Sarah.

636
01:05:28,423 --> 01:05:30,658
Don't fight it.

637
01:05:33,797 --> 01:05:38,333
Sleep now, Sarah. We want
to show you something.

638
01:06:33,257 --> 01:06:35,693
I hope that's a working title.

639
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:40,295
- Are you sure you really...
- Danny was just talking about it...

640
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,102
Maybe we get to see the acting chops
that we've heard so much about.

641
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:48,371
- Sarah, are you a Tater's girl?
- Tracey told us what happened.

642
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:50,505
He was just telling me...

643
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:53,808
You know what you have to do.

644
01:11:39,362 --> 01:11:43,431
What's the matter, Sarah?
Are you not feeling well?

645
01:11:45,702 --> 01:11:47,735
I'm dying.

646
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:54,344
- I'm dying.
- Yes, you are.

647
01:11:54,444 --> 01:12:00,114
You can go into the ground to be
forgotten forever or you can be reborn.

648
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:07,524
Did you expect it to be painless,
that it would be easy,

649
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:09,359
that you'd simply wake up one morning

650
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:13,864
with everything you ever
wanted laid out before you?

651
01:12:14,264 --> 01:12:16,765
I told you Sarah,

652
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:20,737
dreams require sacrifice.

653
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:23,173
And so do we.

654
01:12:23,273 --> 01:12:26,609
I can give you what you want Sarah,

655
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:31,781
but you need to embrace
who you really are.

656
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:36,219
It's time to become one of us.

657
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:40,788
It's time to be remembered.

658
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,601
Grab something.

659
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,543
Hit him.

660
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:31,167
I can't get over
comfortable your bed is.

661
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:33,236
More comfortable than
the five year old futon

662
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:35,903
you've been dragging
around since college?

663
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:41,742
I got to pee.

664
01:14:44,547 --> 01:14:46,449
- You want anything?
- Yeah, I want some water

665
01:14:46,549 --> 01:14:49,185
and a treat,
a little special something.

666
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:50,885
Okay.

667
01:15:48,611 --> 01:15:51,512
- Bravo.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

668
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:56,086
Sarah?

669
01:15:56,586 --> 01:15:59,556
You scared the shit out of me.

670
01:15:59,856 --> 01:16:01,455
Don't!

671
01:16:05,628 --> 01:16:08,729
Sarah, what are you doing here?

672
01:16:10,466 --> 01:16:14,637
You let him put that
revolting thing in you.

673
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:18,274
And then he gives you
the role of Simone back.

674
01:16:18,374 --> 01:16:20,741
You were watching us?

675
01:16:23,713 --> 01:16:27,551
You think I had to fuck Danny
to get a role in his movie?

676
01:16:28,851 --> 01:16:33,357
That's sad that you see
the world like that.

677
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:38,962
Sarah, you know that me and Danny
have hooked up before, right?

678
01:16:39,062 --> 01:16:42,864
Did it ever occur to you that
maybe we just like each other?

679
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:49,774
Sarah, get the fuck out of here.

680
01:16:51,174 --> 01:16:53,410
You know what's sad?

681
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,476
You.

682
01:16:57,146 --> 01:16:59,246
All of you.

683
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:05,556
A role in Danny's
little film, how sad.

684
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:11,294
What's sadder is that you
think I want any of it,

685
01:17:11,394 --> 01:17:13,461
that I'd sink so low.

686
01:17:15,164 --> 01:17:18,968
Right. Why would you have
to fuck Danny for her role

687
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:23,107
when you've already fucked
some big time movie producer?

688
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:29,577
Yeah, Tracy told us about the stack
of cash from Astreus Pictures.

689
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:36,386
Oh, my God,

690
01:17:37,186 --> 01:17:39,088
Sarah, did you...

691
01:17:39,188 --> 01:17:43,359
Did you actually suck
some old producer's cock

692
01:17:43,459 --> 01:17:47,729
for a role in a movie
called The Silver Scream?

693
01:17:55,336 --> 01:17:57,307
That's sad.

694
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:00,443
It's a gateway part.

695
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:02,378
From here it sounds
a lot like prostitution.

696
01:18:02,478 --> 01:18:03,678
Don't!

697
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:11,688
- Sarah, what happened to you?
- Don't, don't touch me.

698
01:18:11,788 --> 01:18:12,789
- Sarah...
- Don't touch me.

699
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:13,890
- Sarah.
- Don't.

700
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:14,958
Stop it, stop it.

701
01:18:15,058 --> 01:18:19,193
- We need to get you to a hospital.
- No, no, get off me.

702
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:07,574
It feels good.

703
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:15,950
See what happens
when you stop fighting?

704
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:20,390
Trust us, Sarah.

705
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:23,190
Don't hurt yourself.

706
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,862
Let us in. Embrace who you are.

707
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:31,492
What's up?

708
01:23:27,903 --> 01:23:29,470
Sarah?

709
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:34,241
What are you doing here?

710
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:41,748
Hey, did you see Erin?

711
01:23:43,252 --> 01:23:46,720
Yeah. We talked.

712
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:51,894
Okay, what did you talk about?

713
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:53,727
You.

714
01:23:55,464 --> 01:23:57,064
Right.

715
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:05,977
Did she tell you how
worried we are about you?

716
01:24:07,877 --> 01:24:10,814
Since you ran off the other night?

717
01:24:11,414 --> 01:24:15,386
You know, Tracy came by here,
she said the two of you had a big fight.

718
01:24:17,186 --> 01:24:19,319
We're all pretty concerned.

719
01:24:26,262 --> 01:24:29,353
Look, Sarah, whatever is going on...

720
01:24:32,254 --> 01:24:34,267
we can help you.

721
01:24:34,703 --> 01:24:37,775
You know, just talk to me.

722
01:24:39,475 --> 01:24:41,358
You,

723
01:24:42,059 --> 01:24:43,944
help me?

724
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,217
Yeah.

725
01:24:52,688 --> 01:24:55,425
Yeah, I'm your friend.

726
01:24:56,125 --> 01:24:58,459
No, you're not.

727
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:01,728
None of you are.

728
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:06,667
Sarah, of course we are.

729
01:25:09,071 --> 01:25:10,904
Sarah?

730
01:25:12,174 --> 01:25:14,608
Jesus, what's wrong
with you? Are you...?

731
01:25:27,056 --> 01:25:29,289
I don't have any friends.

732
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:39,633
Wait! Don't!

733
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:43,537
Sarah, don't, don't.

734
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:50,510
Why, why?

735
01:25:53,048 --> 01:25:56,787
There's only one thing in
this whole world that I want

736
01:25:58,387 --> 01:26:01,054
and they're going to give it to me.

737
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:13,633
They see the real me.

738
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:43,490
Yes.

739
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:50,799
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

740
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:54,234
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

741
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:57,940
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

742
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:01,241
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

743
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:04,613
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

744
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:07,950
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

745
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:11,585
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

746
01:28:11,687 --> 01:28:14,857
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

747
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:18,260
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

748
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,896
Hail Astreus. Hail...

749
01:28:20,996 --> 01:28:24,965
She is ready to transform.

750
01:29:30,966 --> 01:29:32,699
Sarah?

751
01:29:35,104 --> 01:29:37,370
Sarah, are you here?

752
01:29:44,313 --> 01:29:46,012
Sarah?

753
01:29:47,182 --> 01:29:49,115
Are you in there?

754
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:54,454
Sarah?

755
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:01,097
All right, this is just weird.

756
01:30:01,697 --> 01:30:04,130
And a fire hazard.

757
01:30:06,635 --> 01:30:10,937
Look, I'm sorry, okay.

758
01:30:12,374 --> 01:30:16,062
I shouldn't have told everyone what
happened. That's your business.

759
01:30:16,162 --> 01:30:20,480
If you wanted them to know then
well you would've told them.

760
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:28,254
Anyway, I needed to say that.

761
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hey, are you okay in there?

762
01:30:42,738 --> 01:30:44,538
You're hurting me.

763
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:53,950
Your eyes. You told everyone.

764
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,019
Lie down next to me.

765
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:02,091
Come lie next to me,
Trace, like old times.

766
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:05,458
I don't want to do that.

767
01:31:06,662 --> 01:31:08,698
Come to me.

768
01:31:09,498 --> 01:31:13,200
We're all alone. There's nothing.

769
01:31:23,178 --> 01:31:25,945
Things are changing for me, Trace.

770
01:31:27,049 --> 01:31:28,483
That's good.

771
01:31:29,783 --> 01:31:31,951
I'm happy for you.

772
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:35,455
I just wanted to say goodbye.

773
01:31:37,526 --> 01:31:41,261
Where... are you going?

774
01:31:45,367 --> 01:31:47,701
Just say goodbye to me, Trace.
