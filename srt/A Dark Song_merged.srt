1
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,075
The furnishings can all
be removed if, uh--

3
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,510
No.

4
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,479
I would want the furnishing as they are.

5
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,913
Okay.

6
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:27,821
When would you want the house?

7
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,158
I'd want it immediately.

8
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:31,759
Have you been looking long?

9
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:32,826
I have.

10
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,499
There hasn't been anyone
here for a few years.

11
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,768
Is it what you are looking for?

12
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,570
Which way does this room face?

13
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,807
This room faces west.

14
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,347
West.

15
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,488
I want this house.

16
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,525
It's a one year minimum
contract I'm afraid.

17
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:08,262
A year then, how much?

18
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,030
Ten thousand four hundred.

19
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,465
Eight hundred deposit.

20
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,203
This is for you.

21
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,738
For the paper work--

22
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,542
For privacy.

23
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:08,522
You can do this?

24
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,758
Do you think this is an interview?

25
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,159
No.

26
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:15,696
Who else did you ask?

27
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:19,166
Michael Stotes, Ukeme Bantaam,
Alexandra Pol--

28
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,468
Okay.

29
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,708
Are we going to go and
look at the house?

30
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,553
Okay. The fuckin' house.

31
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,278
It's cold in here.

32
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,079
There's no heating.

33
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,248
There's no heating?

34
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,651
You're not selling this.

35
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,219
It doesn't matter, does it?

36
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,355
What, the heating? No.

37
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,728
You not having one?

38
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,666
You started then?

39
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,568
Purifying yourself?

40
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,437
Yes.

41
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:30,904
Let's hear it.

42
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,541
I've followed the diet.

43
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,611
I've had no alcohol for 22 weeks.

44
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:40,213
I've abstained from sex.

45
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,415
All sex?

46
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,783
Masturbation as well?

47
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,352
All sex.

48
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:46,454
Yeah, it gets tricky
after a month, don't it?

49
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:49,757
And the diet?

50
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,825
The last 27 days...

51
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,127
...I have only eaten
between dusk and dawn.

52
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,466
For the next three days,
I'll fast completely.

53
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,268
Are you Protestant or Catholic?

54
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,204
I'm Catholic.

55
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,973
Catholic.

56
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,675
And the rite?

57
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,286
The Abramelin.
You're not fuckin' about.

58
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,090
No.

59
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,258
I've done this three times.

60
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,395
Once it worked, twice it didn't.

61
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,363
It didn't?

62
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:32,633
Well I was younger, you've
got to have the right person.

63
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,105
Why?

64
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,207
For love.

65
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,143
For love.

66
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:47,014
I love someone, they
don't love me anymore.

67
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,239
Well?

68
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,807
Well what?

69
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,210
Are you going to do it?

70
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,813
No.

71
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:22,750
Why?

72
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,054
House isn't right.

73
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:30,023
There's nothing wrong with this house.

74
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,659
It is everything you asked for.
You agreed that--

75
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,995
The only thing I agreed to
was to look at the house.

76
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,330
And I did and I want my money.

77
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,534
But I've done everything.

78
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,671
Just give me my money.
I wanna get back to London.

79
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,941
- Listen, this is--
- Just give it to me.

80
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,921
You can do it by yourself,
you don't need me.

81
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,823
That's rubbish.

82
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,426
You need someone there,
someone who knows the procedure.

83
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,263
Who told you that, Michael Stotes?

84
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,069
You girls, you stupid,
little posh girls.

85
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,573
Abramelin procedure just to force love.

86
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:23,477
It's like getting Titian
to decorate a cake.

87
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,315
I love this person.

88
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,920
Get over him, just go on a fucking...

89
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,055
...dating website or something.

90
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,724
You don't understand.

91
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:39,927
No, I don't. Fuckin' love.

92
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,168
I'm gonna have fish and
chips when I get home.

93
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,469
That's what I fancy.

94
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,371
Waste of fucking time coming here.

95
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,519
I'll pay you 70,000.

96
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,954
Doesn't matter.

97
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:08,822
Eighty, it's all I've got.

98
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,758
You're not fuckin' listening.

99
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,095
My child died.

100
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,132
I lost my child.

101
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,270
He was taken from me
and it was my fault.

102
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,741
I have to hear his voice again.

103
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,744
I need to speak to him.

104
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:36,183
Talk to your dead child?

105
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,786
That might be something worth
getting up in the morning for.

106
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,722
Why did you lie?

107
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,792
I thought it would be too much.

108
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,561
Is it the truth?

109
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,697
That's important.

110
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,164
It is.

111
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,537
You get to ask for what you want too.

112
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,406
How much do you want it?

113
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,141
More than anything.

114
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,098
I'm having the bedroom
with the bed in it.

115
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,868
You will cook and clean.

116
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,603
You do know what we're takin' on?

117
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,038
Yes.

118
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,406
And you know the dangers?

119
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,808
I do.

120
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,110
This is a serious undertakin'.

121
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,347
It's not fuckin' astral
projection or runes.

122
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,582
This is real stuff we're playing with.

123
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,551
Real angels, real demons.

124
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:45,753
I know this.

125
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,387
You read cunts on the internet saying...

126
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,623
...it's just mental states.

127
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:53,026
That your, that your Guardian
Angel is your higher self.

128
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,262
Psychobabble bollocks.

129
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,699
You'll go for days without
sleep, fastin'...

130
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,302
...backbreaking rites, ritual sex.

131
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,771
You'll be at the very edge.

132
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:08,008
You, uh, ready for all that, darling?

133
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,843
I am.

134
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,680
I've read up on the Kabbalah.

135
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,514
You don't think this is
the Tree of Sephiroth?

136
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,851
- 'Cause, 'cause it's not.
- Um--

137
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,987
You've been looking
shit up on the internet.

138
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,456
No, this is Gnosticism.

139
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,359
I was told it was based on the Kabbalah.

140
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,163
It's there as grammar.
A structure.

141
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,100
The Kabbalah's an exploration of God.

142
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,736
We're doing something much darker.

143
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,229
"Salt, chalk, paint, paint
brushes, three inches...

144
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,097
...five inches, tape,
white masking tape...

145
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,599
...green masking tape,
tee lights, candles."

146
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,569
Food. Four months supply of meat?

147
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,105
Six months minimum, maybe eight.

148
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,107
Once this starts there's no leaving.

149
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:20,814
I need to get to, uh,
an Internet cafe, to a computer.

150
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,950
There's one in the hotel
I was staying in.

151
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,890
I lead a hard life,
I abuse alcohol. I'm DT'ing.

152
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,560
I just need to get it out of
my system before we start.

153
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,128
DT'ing?

154
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,230
Yeah, I use it sometimes.

155
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,299
It's an altered state for the horror.

156
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,270
Will you be alright?

157
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,372
It's just mild.
I just need to shake it off.

158
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,940
You are going to be able to do this?

159
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,675
Oh, for Christ's sake!

160
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:51,812
Are you okay?

161
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,814
I don't need your help.

162
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Sophia. Oh, thank God.

163
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,683
Have you told him about
the psychiatric hospital?

164
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,085
I'm better.

165
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,187
- You're vulnerable.
- No, I'm not.

166
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,591
It was not doing anything,
that's what made me ill.

167
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,093
I am doing something.

168
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,928
This stuff is black, it's against--

169
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,530
So you believe it now?

170
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,532
I believe in God.

171
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,634
What's that suppose to mean?

172
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,803
Is this something Godly?

173
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,740
Imagine it was Lottie.

174
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,277
What would you do?

175
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,745
Not this.

176
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,356
There's nothing wrong with
walking away from all of this.

177
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,591
The kids miss you, they want to see you.

178
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,093
Come home.

179
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,961
We'll look after you.

180
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:37,164
You're going to look after me?

181
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,967
My baby sister?

182
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,969
Don't be like that.

183
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,172
You see that's the difference
between your home and mine.

184
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:47,907
- Soph.
- You have two children.

185
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,711
Two healthy fucking children.

186
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,083
I have a hole.

187
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,487
And tell me where is God?

188
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,624
Where is his goodness?

189
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,160
Sophia--

190
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,730
I am going to do this.

191
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,833
- It doesn't matter--
- I'm sorry.

192
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,703
It doesn't matter
if it's right or wrong.

193
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,207
You're going to keep away from me.

194
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,182
Stay away.

195
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:32,652
Is that understood?

196
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,441
Are you done?

197
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,743
Yeah.

198
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,329
Did you just lie?

199
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,564
No.

200
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:26,533
Look.

201
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,002
Do you speak German?

202
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,239
I can make myself understood.

203
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,374
A half truth is a lie.

204
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,309
I didn't lie.

205
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:40,247
I speak German.
I didn't cause that.

206
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,849
Everything has consequences in this.

207
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,418
I didn't cause that.

208
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:47,687
This has to be pure.

209
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:50,323
Not just your intention, but your drive.

210
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,492
It can go so wrong.

211
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:53,493
There was always gonna be something.

212
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:54,627
I'll help you with your German.

213
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,229
You just had to say.

214
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,870
Go for a walk tomorrow
before we're sealed in, eh.

215
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,105
It's gonna be months
before you see this again.

216
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,276
Okay.

217
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,247
What about you?

218
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:17,049
Me? I'll be alright.

219
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,698
This is your last chance to back out.

220
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,267
Once I complete this circle...

221
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:43,670
...no one can leave till
the Invocation's done.

222
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:47,674
Not for food, not for emergency,
not for anything.

223
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,944
Seal it.

224
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the fuck are you doing in bed?

225
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:57,109
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

226
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,878
I.. I slept in, I'm sorry.

227
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,648
I don't give a toss.
Downstairs!

228
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,889
So magic squares.

229
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,892
Essentially a grid where you make
word and number sequences...

230
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,393
...that add up to one whole,
backwards...

231
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,429
...forwards, diagonally, et cetera.

232
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,731
And used to change a state.

233
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,132
Don't look at me like that.

234
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,534
Mr. Solomon, I'm not questioning you...

235
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,903
...but let's just remember
who's paying for this.

236
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,305
I don't give a fuck about
who's paying who.

237
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:29,542
I don't give a fuck about the money!

238
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:31,544
Eighty thousand pounds
is a lot of money.

239
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,882
Do you know the ritual?

240
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:37,550
Shall I leave you to do it?

241
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:41,087
You will not argue back!

242
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:43,422
I'm giving you what you want.

243
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:45,558
I see it burn in your fuckin' eyes.

244
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,528
You agreed to do whatever I said.

245
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,262
- I asked you.
- I know. I was just--

246
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,232
You had the chance
to back out yesterday.

247
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:54,967
But the house has been sealed.

248
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,102
I'm not backing out.

249
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:57,704
Well, what are you doing?

250
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:00,740
I just want this to work.

251
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,809
And it's gonna work with
posh little you in charge?

252
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:04,811
No.

253
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,384
Eat this.

254
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,287
It's a toadstool.

255
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,625
Have you been listening?
Take it.

256
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:21,193
Do the ritual.
Talk to your Guardian Angel.

257
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,995
Talk to your child.

258
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:34,106
Good.

259
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:37,009
What will it do?

260
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,445
You've been cleansed ritually...

261
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:40,947
...you're gonna be cleansed physically.

262
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,283
Is it going to be horrible?

263
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:45,752
Yep.

264
00:25:57,624 --> 00:25:59,592
The circle is a paradox.

265
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:03,262
No beginning and no end, but bounded.

266
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:07,366
In each circle there are
four essential phases.

267
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:10,670
We consecrate the circles,
open the chamber...

268
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,006
...with the magic squares,
pass through.

269
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:18,110
Five circles, five elements,
five realms.

270
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,848
Now, the Abramelin
is essentially a journey.

271
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:24,550
That's a, that's a poor metaphor.

272
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:27,519
That is, but it will do for now.

273
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,957
This circle, this is
the Chamber of Effect.

274
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:33,292
Element of Wood,
where we seal our vessel...

275
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:36,195
...from the world,
make it safe against attack.

276
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:40,532
This one, the Chamber of the Song.

277
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:44,270
We push off into the void,
on our journey.

278
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,571
Element of fire.

279
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,641
The Blackness.

280
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:53,512
The Boundless,
where we sink into the abyss.

281
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,482
The Tangible.

282
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,051
Earth, metal, water.

283
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,054
The cycle.

284
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:05,658
Now this middle circle,
this is nameless.

285
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:07,760
This is where your angel will appear.

286
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,363
You will ask your favor
and I will ask mine.

287
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,900
When will my angel appear?

288
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,303
Well, we'll be invoking
the angel at every circle...

289
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:20,973
...but each time we move on,
it will grow more powerful.

290
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:24,977
This world will be merged with
other worlds, others will hear.

291
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:27,046
When will the angel appear?

292
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,916
It can appear at any time
from the first invocation.

293
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:32,785
Most likely fourth or fifth circle.

294
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:40,026
Triangle represents
the divine order, three.

295
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:43,495
A whole, divisible only by one,
the Trinity.

296
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,564
It's where you gain focus.

297
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,099
Stop you going mad.

298
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,904
This is the world of decay...

299
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:55,241
...of death, brute fact.

300
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,244
The square represents its form,
the number four...

301
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,212
...square of two, a perfect number.

302
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,216
This room is your urges, your baseness.

303
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:07,153
It is where you will gain your steel.

304
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,222
Break it.

305
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:14,026
What does that phrase do?

306
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,895
It's a transitional.

307
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:18,097
It is, what does it transfer?

308
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:22,068
Object to subject or
subject to predicate.

309
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,203
Good, now get the symbols tighter.

310
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,645
Feel its mass, its unmoving.

311
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:11,851
Feel its coolness, its stillness.

312
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:15,855
Did you get to the loo?
No talking.

313
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:20,226
For the next two days
I'm gonna unshackle...

314
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:22,328
...the house from the world.

315
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,396
You mustn't leave the circle.

316
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:28,835
No food, no water.

317
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:31,137
Focus on the stones I've given you.

318
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,572
Fall into it.

319
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:37,209
Swallow the pain and discomfort.

320
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:41,213
On the third mornin' we will
break for water and food.

321
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,715
Then we'll do the same thing
in the back two rooms.

322
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,919
Six days.

323
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,158
I'll start squares.

324
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,166
"And may all my transgressions
be washed."

325
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,569
"And make me chaste and pure."

326
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,239
"May my light be here now."

327
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,244
"Guiding me, protecting me."

328
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,615
"And may all my transgressions
be washed."

329
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:17,716
<i>Transgressions be washed.</i>

330
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,085
"And make me chaste and pure."

331
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:20,186
<i>Chaste and pure.</i>

332
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:21,220
"Protecting me."

333
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,855
<i>Protecting me.</i>

334
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,490
"May my light be here now."

335
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,892
<i>May my light be here now.</i>

336
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:28,160
"Guiding me."

337
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,495
"Protecting me."

338
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:30,997
<i>Protecting me. Protecting me.</i>

339
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:34,000
"And may all my transgressions
be washed."

340
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,634
"And make me chaste and pure."

341
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:38,337
<i>Chaste and pure.
Make me chaste and pure.</i>

342
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,415
It's raining.

343
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:24,917
Outside's an irrelevance.

344
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,520
Have you been hearing the dog?

345
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,989
The dog?

346
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,790
Yeah, there's a dog that barks at night.

347
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,493
No.

348
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,229
Maybe.

349
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,202
When are we going
to know that it's started?

350
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:44,803
What do you mean?

351
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,140
Well, how do we know that
something's happening?

352
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,375
That it's working?
That it's not--

353
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:51,743
That's why I was thinking about the dog.

354
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,912
- We're miles from anywhere.
- A dog?

355
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:56,415
Shit.

356
00:31:58,017 --> 00:31:59,785
It's begun.

357
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,354
- What?
- It's a sign.

358
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:04,756
Synchronicity, that's a sign,
that it's beginning.

359
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:07,193
That's it?

360
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:08,961
That's how it starts.

361
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:11,730
It's just a bird hitting
against the window.

362
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,099
A black bird.

363
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:19,538
I can't see.

364
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:22,274
It was black. It was.

365
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,954
The circles are fuckin' hard to master.

366
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,893
Each one will take weeks.

367
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,500
All the other rituals are about you.

368
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:52,671
The shifting consciousness.

369
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,442
Becoming one with the ceremony.

370
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:00,812
Pure.

371
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:11,190
Look at me. Look at me.

372
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,161
This is real. Focus on me.

373
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:18,830
- I need sleep.
- Not yet.

374
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:54,533
It's part of the ritual.

375
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,268
I don't do forgiveness.

376
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,504
What the fuck did I say
at the beginning?

377
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,572
You've worked around other things.

378
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:03,975
Can you work around this?

379
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:08,514
Yeah, but it'll make life hard.

380
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:10,716
I don't do forgiveness.

381
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:13,585
I know a way around.

382
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,268
Drink it.

383
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:30,502
But--

384
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,871
Blood sacrifice, this is your choice.

385
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,076
There are diseases.
Hepatitis.

386
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:40,879
- Can I do mine?
- No! Drink it!

387
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:43,149
Look, it's starting to congeal!

388
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,431
Good. Swallow it.

389
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:11,009
Don't throw it up.
Keep it down.

390
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,378
Keep it down!

391
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,080
Drink it.

392
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,486
It's a blood sacrifice,
this is your choice.

393
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:22,354
But I did.

394
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,655
No! Drink it!

395
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:26,292
Look, it's starting to congeal!

396
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:05,291
Why do you ask? Does this,
uh, question bother you?

397
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,827
It's actually a bit of
an ontological issue.

398
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,862
You know what I mean.

399
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:15,501
I would say no.

400
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,336
We're not trying to hurt anyone...

401
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:19,605
...but we're doing dark things.

402
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:22,207
And would you do black magic?

403
00:37:22,308 --> 00:37:23,975
There's no point in going
to the fair ground...

404
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,944
...if you don't go
on any of the rides.

405
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,779
Have you seen much?

406
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:31,950
I've seen things.

407
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,486
I've seen Gods, demons.

408
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,956
I like Gods rain silver on me.

409
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:40,459
And the dead and the damned.

410
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,761
Most of us are damned, you know.

411
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:45,364
Have you seen anything that scared you?

412
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:47,799
It all scares me.

413
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,335
Is that the point?

414
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,570
No, the point is to know.

415
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,272
To fucking know.

416
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:56,107
And to see the architecture...

417
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,710
...and the levers to climb the mountain.

418
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,246
- Power?
- Knowledge.

419
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:06,585
Fucking stop this.
It's time for bed.

420
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,790
You'll see it soon enough
and then you will know.

421
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,092
Then you will understand.

422
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,164
You haven't been through my stuff
for any reason, have you?

423
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,700
No.

424
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,303
Something's missing.
Something that I can't--

425
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,305
I'm not going through your stuff.

426
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,748
It'll turn up.

427
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:59,371
I hear it. What is it?

428
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:03,442
That's us being noticed.

429
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:06,011
Probably don't know what we are yet.

430
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,946
Are you sure?

431
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:09,448
It could be--

432
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:10,982
What the fuck?

433
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,291
We need to seal the circle.

434
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,193
Which is going to take a while.

435
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,030
Was that real?

436
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,733
We have to progress very
carefully from now on...

437
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,535
...everything tight.

438
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,850
I'm on a beach by myself.

439
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:48,186
Everything's dead.

440
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,590
I walk towards a village...

441
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:55,260
...past the bodies
of my family and friends.

442
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,930
I turn a corner...

443
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,600
...and there's a weird
old woman standing there.

444
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:07,473
She's holding the hand of my son, Jack.

445
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:11,443
I can't see his face.

446
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,780
He turns around--

447
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,582
And I wake up.

448
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:21,352
Oh, it's just your mind
working on things.

449
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:23,855
This process is not about epiphanies.

450
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,356
Dreams matter, mind.

451
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:28,059
And they're part of the architecture.

452
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,596
I mean, you're going
to get vivid dreams...

453
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:33,532
...and deja vu, broken time.

454
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:34,733
Do you want to know what I have...

455
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:37,402
...a recurring dream
about at the moment?

456
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:39,805
- That I own a moped.
- A what?

457
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:43,441
Yeah, that I own a, I own a moped.

458
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,143
That's the dream.

459
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,615
You'd think in all this, wouldn't you?

460
00:40:56,722 --> 00:40:58,123
Fuckin' hell.

461
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,296
I told you, we'd have to do it.

462
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,200
Yeah.

463
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:54,105
We want the ritual to work.

464
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:57,242
You're not going to
back out now, are you?

465
00:42:57,342 --> 00:42:59,745
- No.
- Good.

466
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:03,214
Do we need to go to the other room?

467
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,983
No. We can do it here.

468
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,357
Brush your hair.

469
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:14,225
- I need--
- Be quick.

470
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:17,128
Get changed into that T-shirt
and put some make up on.

471
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:19,030
Make up?

472
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,099
I'm just a man.

473
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,880
Look at you.

474
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,651
- Don't you need your books?
- No.

475
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:41,887
But isn't it part of--

476
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:43,922
Do you know what you're fuckin' doing?

477
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:47,192
- No.
- Well, shut up then!

478
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,928
- Sorry.
- Sorry, Mr. Solomon.

479
00:43:50,028 --> 00:43:52,597
Sorry, Mr. Solomon.

480
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:54,465
Take off your jeans.

481
00:44:08,747 --> 00:44:12,250
Now take off your t-shirt. Slowly.

482
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:23,929
Put your hands in your knickers.

483
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:27,833
You know, go on.

484
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,238
Okay, take 'em off.

485
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:42,147
Okay, turn around, bend over.

486
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:47,953
K.. Kneel down.
Kneel down!

487
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,089
Show me.

488
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,794
Ah, fuck.

489
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:59,330
Ah! Oh, fuck.

490
00:45:04,102 --> 00:45:06,237
Put your clothes back on.

491
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:08,006
That wasn't sex magic.

492
00:45:08,106 --> 00:45:11,376
There's no sex magic
in this fuckin' ritual.

493
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:13,478
You've got to be pure.

494
00:45:13,578 --> 00:45:15,646
I had to get my mind.

495
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:17,215
You shit.

496
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:20,518
Don't you fuckin' talk to me like that.

497
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:22,020
Don't forget what I'm doing for you.

498
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,089
Fuck you!

499
00:45:57,188 --> 00:46:00,926
You can serve yourself,
I'm not fucking hungry.

500
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:31,823
But I told you, didn't I?

501
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:33,258
This is the way that it works.

502
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:34,759
It's two, three passes at it.

503
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,062
It's a cycle, I said at the beginning.

504
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:39,630
- I'm not doing it again.
- But you've got no choice.

505
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,166
I do. I'm going.
This is shit.

506
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:44,269
It is not shit!
I wish it were.

507
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:46,004
I'm not doing it again.
I'm fuckin' going.

508
00:46:46,104 --> 00:46:47,638
No, no, no!
Don't open the door!

509
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,575
Don't cross the line, we'll be fucked.

510
00:46:50,675 --> 00:46:52,978
Cross the line, we'll be
stuck here forever.

511
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:56,414
Please, you don't--
You just don't know.

512
00:46:58,183 --> 00:47:00,785
But nothing's happened.

513
00:47:00,886 --> 00:47:03,254
It has.

514
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,156
You can feel it.

515
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,929
I promise you...

516
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:12,497
...I will let you talk to your child.

517
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:14,866
I.. I promise you that.

518
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:18,569
You better.

519
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:23,508
You fucking better.

520
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:38,849
Look.

521
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:42,020
Could it have blown in?

522
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,391
No. This is it. I told you.

523
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:16,087
I can feel it.
We're nearly there.

524
00:49:17,222 --> 00:49:18,956
We'll keep pushing.

525
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,792
Seal the seventh chamber.

526
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,861
Then we should really light up.

527
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,922
The world isn't just science, is it?

528
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,459
Is that what you're here to prove?

529
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,862
I don't know. Possibly.

530
00:50:33,998 --> 00:50:36,734
Science describes the least of things.

531
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:39,104
The least of what something is.

532
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:43,141
Religion, magic--

533
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:46,211
Bows to the endless
in everything, the mystery.

534
00:51:16,307 --> 00:51:18,343
I can't find the right bit.

535
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:24,048
We're in the blackness
after the twelfth vessel.

536
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,773
What's for tonight?

537
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:50,708
Why don't you make it?

538
00:51:52,076 --> 00:51:54,111
What did you say?

539
00:51:54,212 --> 00:51:56,714
It's not fucking working.

540
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:01,452
Well--

541
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:04,021
Brilliant, like your style.

542
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,425
You're a stupid, vain, idiotic man.

543
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:09,994
"Vain, idiotic man." I like that.

544
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:11,429
Brilliant, that's told me--

545
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:13,097
Why the fuck isn't it working?

546
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:14,699
I don't know!

547
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:17,435
I think it's you.

548
00:52:18,236 --> 00:52:19,337
What do you mean?

549
00:52:19,437 --> 00:52:21,239
I don't think you've been
telling me the truth...

550
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:23,007
...about why you're doing this.

551
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:24,442
I can just sense it.

552
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:26,811
I've told you the truth.

553
00:52:26,911 --> 00:52:27,912
Look at me.

554
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:29,714
This is ridiculous.
It's all shit.

555
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:31,316
Look at me.

556
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:35,753
Have you told me everything?

557
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:38,589
- Yes.
- You bitch!

558
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:40,825
You stupid bitch!

559
00:52:40,925 --> 00:52:42,727
Fucking bitch!

560
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,995
Fucking tell me.

561
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,334
I want vengeance.

562
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,605
My seven-year-old child was murdered...

563
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:56,641
...by idiots doing a ritual.

564
00:52:56,741 --> 00:53:00,345
You lied to me.
You fucking, stupid cow.

565
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:01,846
Would you have done it, if you'd known?

566
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:03,080
Yes!

567
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,415
I don't need you to be virtuous.

568
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:05,983
I need you to be driven!

569
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:07,718
You idiot!

570
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:09,987
You're doing this for me!

571
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:12,690
You're the focus!

572
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,492
You're the conduit!

573
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:19,564
Are we going to stop?

574
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:21,532
We can't stop!

575
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:23,167
Ah, jeez.

576
00:53:24,302 --> 00:53:28,439
This, this, this whole fuckin' thing.

577
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,175
Get out of my sight, you fuckin' cunt!

578
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,718
Get up, we've got to do something.

579
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:54,559
Have you been drinking?

580
00:54:55,493 --> 00:54:56,927
We've got to do a ritual.

581
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:59,096
You need to be anew.

582
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:03,634
Can this wait till morning?

583
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:05,903
No, we do it now.

584
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:08,339
It won't be long.

585
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:10,040
Stand in the water.

586
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:40,571
It's cold.

587
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:48,212
Strengthen her soul.

588
00:55:48,312 --> 00:55:51,181
Horace, Orpheus, Baal, Christ.

589
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,384
Strengthen her soul.

590
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,986
Strengthen her soul.

591
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:59,724
Horace, Orpheus, Baal, Christ.

592
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,128
I'm going to duck you under three times.

593
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:06,831
- Can't this wait till morning?
- We need to do this.

594
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:18,643
"Take this soul and find it new."

595
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,819
"Make this soul clean and worthy."

596
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:39,697
"Let her touch the void, the nothin'."

597
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,663
Don't look like that woman,
you've just been reborn.

598
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:31,501
Well, I had to do it
to get the rite back on track.

599
00:59:31,602 --> 00:59:35,572
You are now one with the rite,
one with your intention, pure.

600
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:38,042
You fucking cunt.

601
00:59:38,142 --> 00:59:39,343
You nearly fucking killed me.

602
00:59:39,443 --> 00:59:40,745
You just crossed the boundary.

603
00:59:40,845 --> 00:59:42,947
You touched eternity, the endless.

604
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:44,481
I didn't touch fucking anything.

605
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,717
Well, we're back on track.

606
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:48,886
You'll get your vengeance.
Everything points to it.

607
00:59:48,986 --> 00:59:51,555
Fucking make something happen.

608
00:59:54,124 --> 00:59:55,726
I need this!

609
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:05,402
Jesus. Fucking Jesus.

610
01:00:05,502 --> 01:00:09,039
I think this is, this is
the ritual starting to work.

611
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,976
That's the price...

612
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:13,443
...I've got to pay...

613
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,579
...for hurting you.

614
01:00:16,814 --> 01:00:19,817
Your fuckin' Guardian Angel.

615
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:21,652
What are we going to do with this?

616
01:00:21,752 --> 01:00:23,120
Have you got any bandages?

617
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,321
In the cupboard.

618
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:27,024
Get, get.. get the whiskey.

619
01:00:27,524 --> 01:00:29,459
Shit.

620
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:36,600
This is what we've got.

621
01:00:36,701 --> 01:00:39,069
Oh, that'll do. That'll do.

622
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:40,070
What should we do with this?

623
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,939
Oh, the knife, was it clean?

624
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:44,074
- I don't know.
- Let's hope.

625
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:45,910
Let's just, just pull it out.

626
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,177
- Pull it out.
- What?

627
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:48,879
Just pull the fucking thing out.

628
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,681
Shit.

629
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,862
- Oh!
- Shit.

630
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,099
- Okay.
- Yeah.

631
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:10,500
What should I do?

632
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,938
Just, just.. just give,
just give me a minute.

633
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:16,941
Okay, you, you lost your child, go on.

634
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:21,311
He was taken from a day care center.

635
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:23,613
Okay, is he in, is he in prison?

636
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:26,483
- Oh, God.
- They never found anyone.

637
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:28,385
You mothers and your children.

638
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,223
It was three years ago.

639
01:01:33,323 --> 01:01:36,727
The case is closed, it's forgotten.

640
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:39,096
And now you're here with me.

641
01:01:40,464 --> 01:01:42,699
It's less weird than you think.

642
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,568
You're not the first person
I've dealt with...

643
01:01:44,668 --> 01:01:45,903
...who's fucked off with God.

644
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:47,671
You don't know me.

645
01:01:47,772 --> 01:01:50,174
Right, it's time to sew me up.

646
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:51,475
What?

647
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:53,643
Just, just, just--
Swab it with the whiskey.

648
01:01:53,744 --> 01:01:56,013
Okay.

649
01:01:56,113 --> 01:01:57,547
- Okay?
- Yeah.

650
01:01:59,784 --> 01:02:02,386
Fuck. Oh, just do it.

651
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:03,821
I teach fucking RE.

652
01:02:03,921 --> 01:02:07,424
Oh, fuck off, it's not brain surgery.

653
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:11,161
So are you going to tell me now...

654
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:13,430
...what you're going to ask for?

655
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:16,767
- Invisibility.
- Invisibility?

656
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:19,403
Yeah, it's not what you think.

657
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:21,638
I want to, I just want to disappear.

658
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,474
Live the rest of my life
away from the world.

659
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:28,412
I've waited for you.

660
01:02:28,512 --> 01:02:30,547
I want some quiet before the howl.

661
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:36,954
Just don't go thinking this is us
fucking bonding or anything.

662
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:39,456
We're not pals now there, you know that.

663
01:02:41,025 --> 01:02:44,061
Things will start to happen now.

664
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:47,932
I will give you your vengeance,
I promise you.

665
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:11,508
What do you think is going to happen...

666
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:13,477
...when you ask for your vengeance?

667
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:17,081
They will die a horrible death--

668
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:21,385
And they will be damned.

669
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:24,154
You don't think I had
anything to do with it, do you?

670
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:27,224
It was teenagers
playing with the occult.

671
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:30,827
Damning teenagers.

672
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,596
You could ask for so much more.

673
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:35,765
You know, personal things.
Transformations.

674
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:37,634
I'll do it my way.

675
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:42,006
Well, they're damned anyway.

676
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:46,510
Aren't we a pair?

677
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,779
I'm not like you.

678
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:52,849
You're just like me.
Maybe worse.

679
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,452
I am not like you.

680
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:57,521
Look where you are.

681
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:03,527
How are you doing?

682
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,162
Yeah, I'm alright.

683
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,804
Maybe we should stop.

684
01:07:20,904 --> 01:07:22,372
No, we can't.

685
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,374
But you're not well.

686
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:26,443
I'm fucking fine!

687
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:30,180
The power's off.

688
01:07:31,315 --> 01:07:32,516
Well, we've got candles.

689
01:07:32,616 --> 01:07:34,818
Let's just.. let's just...

690
01:07:34,918 --> 01:07:37,821
...fucking try and reach the end.

691
01:07:37,921 --> 01:07:39,489
Uh--

692
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:43,093
If we can't, we'll, then
we'll see where we are.

693
01:07:54,238 --> 01:07:56,240
It's three in line of nine.

694
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,410
Or is it twelve?

695
01:08:02,112 --> 01:08:03,980
Which is it, Mr. Solomon?

696
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:11,288
It's nine.
Yeah, I.. I.. I think it's nine.

697
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:53,062
Mummy.

698
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:55,865
Mummy.

699
01:08:59,536 --> 01:09:02,272
Mummy, please. Are you there?

700
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:07,777
Can you hear me?

701
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:19,423
Help me.

702
01:09:21,124 --> 01:09:22,459
I'm here.

703
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,595
I'm just in here.

704
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:30,099
I can hear you.

705
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,968
It's not you.

706
01:09:32,068 --> 01:09:35,138
It is. You don't know what this is.

707
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:37,407
You don't understand yet.

708
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,244
It's not you, Jack.

709
01:09:51,555 --> 01:09:54,691
I've got to keep quiet, there's a dog.

710
01:09:55,492 --> 01:09:57,093
There's no dog.

711
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,963
There is, you've heard it.

712
01:10:00,063 --> 01:10:02,932
You hear it at night.

713
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,869
It's just a dog outside.

714
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:09,205
Please, keep quiet.
It might hear us.

715
01:10:11,275 --> 01:10:13,009
Where are we?

716
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:14,878
We're in a house--

717
01:10:16,179 --> 01:10:17,847
In the country--

718
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,550
In Wales.

719
01:10:21,685 --> 01:10:23,687
I missed you, mummy.

720
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:27,391
I missed you so much.

721
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:30,294
Have you missed me?

722
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:33,997
Yeah.

723
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:42,806
Mummy, I need you to open the door.

724
01:10:47,544 --> 01:10:49,613
I know you're not him.

725
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:54,584
Mummy, please.
Something's in here.

726
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:56,853
Open the door.

727
01:11:03,327 --> 01:11:04,794
No.

728
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:07,163
Mummy, it's here. It's here.

729
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,965
It's here with me.

730
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:11,768
Mummy, please, please.

731
01:11:11,868 --> 01:11:14,304
- It's here, it's here with me.
- I am going now, Jack.

732
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:16,873
Mummy! Mummy!
It's here, it's here.

733
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:18,808
I am not going to open the door!

734
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:20,310
It's here with me!

735
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:22,546
Mummy, it's frightening.

736
01:11:22,646 --> 01:11:24,914
Open the door!

737
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:26,483
Open the door!

738
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:39,663
It's not your son.

739
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:42,466
I know.

740
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:46,370
But I heard his voice.

741
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:49,939
Words are just a sound.

742
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,644
This is the price of our rage.

743
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:59,516
Embrace it, don't fear it.

744
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:05,655
It's you and it's me.

745
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,429
Poor us.

746
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,102
It's getting colder.

747
01:12:20,437 --> 01:12:22,372
We're in early March.

748
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:25,975
Thought we're in May.

749
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:30,046
No.. I think it's March.

750
01:12:35,318 --> 01:12:37,253
Would you like something to eat?

751
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:40,590
No, no. Not hungry.

752
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:43,993
Do you need to go to bed?

753
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:45,762
Eh, no.

754
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:47,631
No, got to keep going.

755
01:12:48,665 --> 01:12:50,667
I need that steel.

756
01:12:51,334 --> 01:12:53,537
No surrender.

757
01:12:53,637 --> 01:12:55,405
- Are you okay?
- Um.. um, uh, yeah.

758
01:12:55,505 --> 01:12:57,206
- Okay.
- Uh--

759
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

760
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:23,553
I'm a servant.

761
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:26,489
I'm a warrior.

762
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:29,626
- You are.
- Yeah.

763
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:33,362
I.. I--

764
01:15:35,098 --> 01:15:37,366
Shouted down his enemies.

765
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:41,504
I.. gloried in His creation.

766
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:46,275
Demons fear me.

767
01:15:53,349 --> 01:15:55,619
I miss my sister.

768
01:16:01,257 --> 01:16:03,226
Oh, God.

769
01:16:09,365 --> 01:16:11,300
Is God here now?

770
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:20,109
Sophia.. I'm--

771
01:19:28,932 --> 01:19:31,200
Come on. Shit.

772
01:20:52,548 --> 01:20:55,751
Let someone be in.
Let someone be in.

773
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,520
Let someone be there.

774
01:21:20,843 --> 01:21:22,011
No.

775
01:21:22,912 --> 01:21:24,213
No!

776
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:41,470
Mummy, open the door.

777
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:44,807
No.

778
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:48,277
Why weren't you there?

779
01:25:48,377 --> 01:25:51,414
You were meant to pick me up at 3:30.

780
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:54,617
I'm sorry.

781
01:25:57,586 --> 01:25:59,054
I'm so sorry.

782
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:04,026
Were you with that man?

783
01:26:08,531 --> 01:26:09,965
I love you.

784
01:26:13,436 --> 01:26:15,271
I love you so much.

785
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:21,310
I miss you everyday.

786
01:26:23,946 --> 01:26:25,981
You are my whole world.

787
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:31,454
I am so sorry.

788
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:39,161
Are you asking me to forgive you?

789
01:26:41,297 --> 01:26:42,565
No.

790
01:26:46,235 --> 01:26:48,471
I'm going to get your killers.

791
01:26:51,006 --> 01:26:52,775
I'm going to get them.

792
01:26:54,777 --> 01:26:56,845
They're not my killers.

793
01:26:59,181 --> 01:27:01,016
I'm just some cunt...

794
01:27:01,116 --> 01:27:05,321
...using your son's voice
to make you afraid.

795
01:27:07,423 --> 01:27:08,624
I know.

796
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

797
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:24,246
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

798
01:31:27,115 --> 01:31:28,651
I am so sorry.

799
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:56,772
So beautiful.

800
01:33:16,191 --> 01:33:17,525
I'm sorry.

801
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:23,899
I'm so sorry.

802
01:33:45,788 --> 01:33:47,756
The favor I want is--

803
01:33:52,761 --> 01:33:54,997
The favor I want is--

804
01:34:07,943 --> 01:34:10,612
I want the power to forgive.
