1
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,845
-Good sleep?
-Not bad.

2
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:36,434
So where are we?

3
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:37,722
Where you from?

4
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:40,060
San Diego.
Left yesterday.

5
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,107
So you came Honolulu-Guam-Pago-here?

6
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:45,522
Long trip.

7
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:47,191
What do you do?

8
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:49,326
I'm a psychologist.

9
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,370
Hey, a shrink.

10
00:03:51,873 --> 00:03:53,700
They've called in everything else.

11
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:54,907
How do you mean?

12
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,659
We've ferried people out of Guam
for the last 2 days.

13
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,625
Physicists, biologists, mathematicians,
you name it.

14
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:04,132
Everybody being flown to the middle
of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean.

15
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:05,381
What's going on?

16
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,635
They're not telling us anything, sir.
What did they tell you?

17
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:11,220
There was a plane crash.

18
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:13,136
Do you get called in on crashes?

19
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:17,606
I'm on a list of psychologists the FAA
brings in when a plane goes down.

20
00:04:18,483 --> 00:04:20,392
So where exactly are we now?

21
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:22,609
That's where we're headed.
Over there.

22
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:23,941
Here.

23
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,228
Take a look.

24
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:28,022
What is that?

25
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,915
All that for a plane crash?

26
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,408
I never mentioned a plane crash.

27
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:55,018
-Any other gear? Watch your step.
-I'd like to call my family.

28
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,306
We'll get you settled in quarters first.
Remain there till we send for you.

29
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:00,853
-I'd like to get started.
-We'll send for you.

30
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,484
-It's critical I see them--
-Who?

31
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,144
The survivors. If I don't get to them
in the first 24 hours--

32
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,398
-What survivors?
-The survivors of the plane crash.

33
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:09,029
Plane crash?

34
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:12,488
I deal in post-traumatic stress
and survival guilt.

35
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,035
Maybe I should talk to someone
who knows what's going on here.

36
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,164
-Talk to the ship's psychiatrist.
-I'm a psychologist.

37
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,698
That's why I was sent here.

38
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:20,621
I told you people I need a phone.

39
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,166
Discuss that with Mr. Barnes.

40
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,044
That's fine.
Give me a phone, I'll call him.

41
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:26,214
Why are you here?

42
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:29,138
Take your hands off me, please.
Do you have any idea who I am?

43
00:05:29,388 --> 00:05:30,966
Tell him the name
of the book you wrote.

44
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:34,094
Astrophysics You Can Use. It was a
Book-of-the-Month Club Main Selection.

45
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:36,011
Never heard of it.

46
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,315
You really thought he read your book.
You haven't changed.

47
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:41,936
It was written for the layman.

48
00:05:42,193 --> 00:05:43,224
He's not impressed.

49
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:44,896
Is there a phone in here?

50
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:49,152
-I've been trying to call my wife.
-Would you stop touching me?

51
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:50,439
Wait a minute.

52
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:52,274
Beth?

53
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:58,540
Flight quarters.
All units make your flight quarters...

54
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:02,873
...condition one stations for landing.
Stay clear of the fantail--

55
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:06,715
Goodman, you been here long?

56
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:08,545
-I've been here 3 hours.
-Welcome aboard.

57
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,795
This thing scares the hell out of me.

58
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:14,140
It's already too late.
You might as well helicopter me back. . .

59
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:17,559
. . .because the damage is done
to the survivors already.

60
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:20,482
-Hold on. We'll get to that.
-I don't even know who you are.

61
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:21,727
I know who you are.

62
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,770
Who are you? Navy? Military?
What are you?

63
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:26,735
You ever hear of the OSSA?

64
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:29,609
They don't know who I am.
That should reassure you.

65
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:32,238
You haven't talked to anyone about this?

66
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:35,115
-I talked to the helicopter pilot.
-What'd you tell him?

67
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:38,906
I told him I was here to see
the plane crash. That's my job.

68
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,289
Plane crash. Good.

69
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,330
There was no plane crash.

70
00:06:45,048 --> 00:06:46,542
Spacecraft.

71
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:49,588
A spacecraft.
I guess that explains a lot.

72
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:51,587
-NASA?
-That doesn't surprise you?

73
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:53,548
At least it explains the secrecy.

74
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:57,299
The secrecy's critical, Norman.
You made that explicit in your report.

75
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:00,218
What report?

76
00:07:00,563 --> 00:07:01,892
ULF.

77
00:07:02,815 --> 00:07:05,223
I wrote that
for the Bush administration.

78
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:07,062
And that's our bible here.

79
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,817
But that was a report about a possible
encounter with an alien being.

80
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:16,534
You want to come with me?

81
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:20,745
Oh, boy.

82
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:22,163
About 3 weeks ago. . .

83
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:26,084
. . .a ship laying fiber-optic cable
between Honolulu and Sydney. . .

84
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:28,878
. . .hit an obstruction
1 ,000 feet underwater.

85
00:07:29,134 --> 00:07:31,885
Cut this cable here
clean as a shears.

86
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:34,758
The Navy got interested,
sent out a search ship.

87
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:37,340
It turned out that what did it. . .

88
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,976
. . .was this.

89
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:41,267
We took this with side-looking sonar.

90
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:44,268
This is an aerodynamic fin
longer than a football field. . .

91
00:07:44,524 --> 00:07:46,067
. . .bigger than any known wingspan.

92
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,189
This is the fuselage.

93
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:52,490
This is ultrahigh-res SLS bottom scan.
Came in a week ago.

94
00:07:52,741 --> 00:07:55,861
There it is, buried
under about 8 yards of coral.

95
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:58,578
Something's wrong
with that measurement.

96
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:02,413
Pacific coral grows an inch a year.
You can set your watch by it.

97
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:03,664
That's right.

98
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,751
So you're saying this spacecraft
crashed in the year. . . .

99
00:08:08,257 --> 00:08:09,206
1 709.

100
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:12,172
So you're saying this spacecraft crashed
300 years ago?

101
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:13,887
288.

102
00:08:14,138 --> 00:08:15,051
That's impossible.

103
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:18,722
It's not impossible if this spacecraft
came from an alien civilization.

104
00:08:20,102 --> 00:08:21,513
Wait a minute.

105
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,348
You think this is an alien spacecraft?

106
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,230
It's not impossible.
It's ridiculous.

107
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:29,231
We think there's an Unknown Life Form on
the spacecraft. That's why you're here.

108
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:33,278
You are the contact team that
was recommended in the Goodman Report.

109
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:35,487
We have a biochemist. . .

110
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:38,406
. . .to assess the physiology
of the Unknown Life Form.

111
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:41,782
A mathematician, because that'll
probably be our common language.

112
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:45,167
And we have an astrophysicist
to locate its place in the cosmos.

113
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:47,079
-Led by a psychologist.
-Right.

114
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:50,671
Nowadays, the little green men say,
"Take me to your therapist"?

115
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,755
Listen up.

116
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:56,424
"Contact teams meeting
an Unknown Life Form or ULF. . .

117
00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:59,218
. . .must be prepared
for severe psychological impact.

118
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:03,389
Stress reaction of confronting such life
has not been sufficiently studied. . .

119
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:06,054
. . .and cannot be
entirely predicted in advance.

120
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:09,150
But the most likely consequence
of contact is. . .

121
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:10,730
. . .absolute terror. "

122
00:09:10,987 --> 00:09:12,446
That's from Norman's report.

123
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:15,318
I'm sorry, are these parameters correct?

124
00:09:15,616 --> 00:09:19,946
You're saying that you have a spacecraft
over a half a mile long. . .

125
00:09:20,204 --> 00:09:23,371
. . .that crashed into the ocean 300 years
ago and it's completely intact?

126
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,912
That's right.

127
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:29,117
And the kicker is, our sonar
is picking up a low-level hum.

128
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:30,625
Something's still running inside.

129
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:33,799
There's no way this coral could've grown
faster than an inch a year?

130
00:09:34,677 --> 00:09:36,337
That's what we're going there to see.

131
00:09:36,596 --> 00:09:37,378
What?

132
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,504
Who says?

133
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,933
Harry, that's a joke, right?

134
00:09:41,184 --> 00:09:44,469
This is the greatest scientific
discovery since Copernicus. Bigger!

135
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:47,564
The idea that we're not alone,
it'll change everything.

136
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:51,724
Evidence of extraterrestrial life.
You don't want to see that?

137
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:55,444
I got to say that I resent
this briefing very much.

138
00:09:55,698 --> 00:09:56,813
And how's that?

139
00:09:57,366 --> 00:10:00,368
If Norman's report calls for a biologist,
a mathematician. . .

140
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,778
. . .an astrophysicist
and a psychologist. . .

141
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,237
. . .why are you here?

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,704
Physical protocols
start in a half an hour.

143
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:09,534
You always wear glasses?

144
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,086
I just started wearing these.

145
00:10:12,507 --> 00:10:16,126
Are the glasses a problem?
I don't actually need them.

146
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:17,465
They're just for reading.

147
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:20,010
And they're more of a crutch.
I see fine without them.

148
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:24,677
But they didn't anticipate
I'd be going 1 ,000 feet under the water.

149
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:26,348
Do you take prescription medication?

150
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:27,518
No.

151
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:29,397
None at all?

152
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:34,359
Once in a while
sometimes I might take like a. . .

153
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:37,489
. . .a piece of Xanax
or something if I'm nervous.

154
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:39,021
Something like that.

155
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:40,363
But not. . .

156
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:42,113
. . .much.

157
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,368
Knee surgery. Complete reconstruction
of ACL, right knee.

158
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:50,753
Still have steel pin here, steel pin
here, little medial collateral damage.

159
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:53,371
I see that you have a scar
on your neck.

160
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:55,043
Car accident.

161
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:57,589
-Were you drinking?
-Yeah.

162
00:10:57,845 --> 00:10:59,125
But I wasn't driving.

163
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:04,219
Wait, I just want to apologize
for putting your name on the list.

164
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:05,342
Why?

165
00:11:05,602 --> 00:11:09,517
When I made the report a few years ago,
I picked names of people I knew.

166
00:11:09,774 --> 00:11:10,604
And?

167
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:14,025
I know Ted because of his father.

168
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:16,069
-Yeah, so what?
-Beth was a patient.

169
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:17,858
It's a bogus report.

170
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:20,441
What? Did you tell Barnes?

171
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:23,274
You can't do that.
That's fraud.

172
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:27,364
They came to me, new administration,
right? Political agenda.

173
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,958
They said, in case of an alien invasion,
do's and don'ts.

174
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:32,327
Why didn't you just say no?

175
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:34,959
$35,000.

176
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:36,496
It paid the down payment
on my house.

177
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,713
New administration wanted to prove
they're doing something new.

178
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,212
How'd you come up with this team. . .

179
00:11:42,473 --> 00:11:45,344
. . .of a biologist, an astrophysicist
and a mathematician?

180
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:46,632
Right.

181
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:48,638
-How?
-I don't know.

182
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:52,229
It sounded good, right?
Made them come to me.

183
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,856
I forgive you, Norman.
I forgive you!

184
00:11:55,111 --> 00:11:58,195
But I don't forgive you for Ted.
He's a pain in the ass.

185
00:11:58,447 --> 00:11:59,693
I'll talk to him.

186
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:02,025
We'll be there 2 hours.
You don't have to be around him.

187
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:05,570
He idolizes you anyways, but I'll talk
to him. I'll buy you dinner.

188
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,199
-I'm sorry.
-Your secret's safe with me. Come on.

189
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:12,460
I can't believe this thing could. . . .
Like a dream.

190
00:12:12,712 --> 00:12:14,372
Have you called your wife?

191
00:12:14,672 --> 00:12:15,787
Why not?

192
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,292
This'll be a saturation dive.

193
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:22,387
You'll be going to a habitat
in 1 ,000 feet of water.

194
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:25,344
A sub will take you to the Habitat
and you'll transfer aboard.

195
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:29,224
At 1 ,000 feet, your body
will be pressurized for that depth.

196
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:32,766
You could actually take a quick dip.
The pressure wouldn't bother you.

197
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:36,316
Although I wouldn't recommend it
because the water's so cold. . .

198
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,440
. . .you'd freeze to death
in less than 2 minutes.

199
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:41,525
That's the reason for the diving suits.

200
00:12:41,783 --> 00:12:44,701
Your helmet has a rebreather
for your air supply.

201
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:48,910
Following this briefing, I'll take you
to an onboard dive tank.

202
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,614
For the next 8 hours. . .

203
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,292
. . .you'll train in deep-saturation dive
techniques and emergency procedures.

204
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,671
Once you've gone down 1 ,000 feet. . .

205
00:12:56,923 --> 00:13:00,422
. . .if you surface, you'll have to commit
to several days of decompression.

206
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,507
There is no real quick return.

207
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:06,093
However, there is a mini-sub. . .

208
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,638
. . .that may be used as an emergency
escape vehicle.

209
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:11,563
But there must be a ship at the surface
to mate to for decompression.

210
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:15,230
Without decompression,
your body would literally burst.

211
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:18,641
Under these circumstances,
you're very well-controlled.

212
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:22,356
The dive has been planned well
and professionally monitored.

213
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:48,764
The descent will take about 1 3 minutes,
descending at 80 feet a minute.

214
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:52,265
It's going to get chilly.

215
00:13:54,273 --> 00:13:55,932
Try to relax.

216
00:13:57,735 --> 00:14:00,570
Next time, just tell us
when you're going to push the button.

217
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:10,570
Mozart. . .

218
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:12,990
...Horn Concerto in E-flat...

219
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,994
...K-447.

220
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:40,230
How you holding up, Captain Nautical?

221
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:41,897
-I'm loose.
-You're loose?

222
00:14:42,155 --> 00:14:43,352
I'm loose. I'm loose.

223
00:14:44,156 --> 00:14:45,069
I'm uptight.

224
00:14:45,325 --> 00:14:47,198
-We okay?
-We're in the river now.

225
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:48,401
What river?

226
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:50,903
It's a temperature/salinity
differential.

227
00:14:51,164 --> 00:14:53,322
It flows like a river
inside the ocean.

228
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:57,249
-Under the ocean and there's a river.
-That's right.

229
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:03,631
You okay?

230
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:06,423
Right now, I'm not okay.
Would you please not touch me?

231
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,921
We're both nervous. Yes?

232
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,303
Would you cut that out, please?

233
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:16,847
You're having a stress reaction.
That's Harry's stress reaction.

234
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:23,363
Those noises we're hearing,
that's normal?

235
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:27,860
Those noises are the water pressure
attacking the sub's integrity.

236
00:15:28,785 --> 00:15:31,454
You know a little something about that,
don't you, Norman?

237
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:34,243
How the pressure
can attack your integrity.

238
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,660
Come on, you be nice this trip.

239
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:40,003
Were you nice last time?

240
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:46,086
You two want to sit together?

241
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:50,300
My God!

242
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:53,048
Norman, look at this, look at this.

243
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,593
Jesus! That's just the fin.

244
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:33,515
That's the Habitat.

245
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:37,557
The Navy moved it in sections
and set it up as a base...

246
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,221
...as soon as the spaceship
was discovered.

247
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:42,607
It's manned by 2 naval personnel.

248
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,311
It will be your home-away-from-home
while we investigate the spacecraft.

249
00:16:46,947 --> 00:16:49,154
It ain't the Motel 6.

250
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,504
Approaching docking bay from R-4.

251
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:25,233
All personnel, descent sub one
engaging lock area.

252
00:17:29,157 --> 00:17:30,900
You are now depressurized.

253
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,210
We're going to pressurize you now.

254
00:17:51,513 --> 00:17:55,462
It's hot in there, but you're going to
feel coolness. That's the helium.

255
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:58,596
-Helium?
-Was I the only one paying attention?

256
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:03,142
Oxygen is a corrosive gas, in the same
family as fluorine and chlorine. . .

257
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:05,191
. . .hydrochloric acid,
hydrofluoric acid.

258
00:18:05,443 --> 00:18:07,187
That's why we're breathing helium.

259
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:10,980
Because oxygen at any level
higher than 2.3 becomes toxic.

260
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:14,818
Can you run that by me again, Ted?
I don't speak balloon.

261
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,074
What?

262
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:21,031
That's my voice. The helium resonates
differently with my vocal chords.

263
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:23,119
"Follow the yellow brick road. "

264
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,582
Kiddies, cut it out.

265
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,128
The voice regulators are behind you.
Put them on.

266
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:32,130
The Navy dive team is setting up
a hydraulic robot. . .

267
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:34,510
. . .in the air lock
outside the spacecraft.

268
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:37,006
We'll use that to open its door.

269
00:18:38,477 --> 00:18:39,888
Is that the door?

270
00:18:40,145 --> 00:18:44,724
Yeah, we used sonar imaging to pinpoint
it before the divers went down.

271
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,566
-How tall is that robot?
-Five feet.

272
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,607
And it's roughly the same size
as an airplane door, isn't it?

273
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,321
-Excuse me, Ted.
-I think that's worth taking note of.

274
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:57,868
Excuse me. Tell them our team
is in place and ready, okay?

275
00:18:58,121 --> 00:19:00,114
This is Habitat to Navy dive.

276
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,329
Has it occurred to anyone
maybe we shouldn't open that door?

277
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:05,242
Why do you say that?

278
00:19:05,504 --> 00:19:07,129
We assume they'll be green. . .

279
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:08,840
. . .or insect-like,
but basically human.

280
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:12,175
But what if they inhale air
and exhale cyanide gas? It's plausible.

281
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:14,716
Or live forever,
like a virus or a yeast.

282
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:18,181
But why would you assume that a ULF
would want to kill us?

283
00:19:18,434 --> 00:19:20,759
An immortal creature wouldn't think
killing was right or wrong.

284
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,395
It'd have no concept of it.

285
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:25,647
Instant eradication. It's what all the
serious scientific stuff talks about.

286
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,310
What little there is on the subject.

287
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:29,483
You did put that in your report?

288
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:31,058
It's in there.

289
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,701
Get us the ETD for team's departure
to surface.

290
00:19:37,953 --> 00:19:39,910
Tell them we're in ready
and thank them.

291
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:42,737
Habitat to Navy Dive.
Our team's ready to take over.

292
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,573
Descent sub ready
for your return to surface.

293
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:48,753
Thanks for all your help.
We'll let you know what we find.

294
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:02,933
I'm not too thrilled
at the prospect of this.

295
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:05,103
What if you have to go to the bathroom?

296
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:06,731
Just go down your leg, Ted.

297
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:08,604
Really?

298
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:10,235
You can urinate in these?

299
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:11,400
You can.

300
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:14,110
The question is, do you want to?

301
00:20:26,586 --> 00:20:28,127
Where's the switch?

302
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,468
Okay, let's go.

303
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,292
All right, Fletcher. . .

304
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:12,003
. . .we're at 1 ,022 feet.

305
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:15,759
The ambient temperature,
34 degrees.

306
00:21:16,302 --> 00:21:18,177
Heading out north-northwest...

307
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:20,180
. . .330.

308
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:22,506
It's a firm bottom.

309
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:23,882
Intermittent coral.

310
00:21:26,355 --> 00:21:28,680
This is great, you guys.

311
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,212
Look at the size of that thing!

312
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:02,547
My God!

313
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:10,689
You see that tunnel?

314
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:13,567
That's where we're going.

315
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:17,444
Into the heart of darkness.

316
00:22:32,755 --> 00:22:36,455
We're in the coral pipe now, Fletcher,
approaching the air lock.

317
00:22:37,093 --> 00:22:39,584
I'm feeling pressure in my ears.
Is that normal?

318
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:41,921
Just use your equalizer.

319
00:22:42,932 --> 00:22:44,130
A little better.

320
00:22:45,184 --> 00:22:48,102
The most toxic creatures on Earth
live down here.

321
00:22:48,354 --> 00:22:51,639
The venom of the land animal
is nothing by comparison.

322
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,767
Even the weakest sea snake
is invariably lethal.

323
00:22:56,195 --> 00:22:58,521
Is that supposed to make me
feel good, Beth?

324
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:02,113
This is our air lock.

325
00:23:03,536 --> 00:23:06,656
It'll take us from a wet
to a dry environment.

326
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,246
We're assuming the inside
of the ship is sealed.

327
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:12,458
This thing is enormous.

328
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:25,784
That's not budging, is it?

329
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:28,030
-Turn it at 45 degrees.
-What's happening here?

330
00:24:28,288 --> 00:24:29,403
Is that piston broken?

331
00:24:29,665 --> 00:24:32,369
Can you get the suction cup
flat to the plane of the door?

332
00:24:32,668 --> 00:24:34,079
Maybe it's the hydraulics.

333
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:36,827
The pressure messes everything up
at this depth.

334
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:40,998
Time for a demonstration
in basic physics, gentlemen.

335
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:49,257
What is it, Harry?

336
00:24:49,518 --> 00:24:50,680
Take a look.

337
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:52,009
It's chipped.

338
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:53,599
All right, it's chipped.
So what?

339
00:24:53,856 --> 00:24:56,560
I thought you said this thing
wasn't damaged when it crashed. . .

340
00:24:56,817 --> 00:25:00,352
. . .that this titanium alloy was
so super-strong, you can't hurt it.

341
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,942
I did.

342
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:05,229
So why does it chip when this scientist
just bangs it with a hammer?

343
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:06,992
Is there heat coming off this thing?

344
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,410
You're right. Get out of there.
Back up.

345
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:11,945
Just a minute.

346
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:13,992
I mean, get back now!
Get back.

347
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:16,749
Jesus.

348
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:32,845
Anybody else wonder who the hell
opened that door?

349
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:37,101
How did that happen?

350
00:25:39,235 --> 00:25:42,319
I'm not sure about the atmosphere.
Helmets stay on.

351
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:43,734
All right.

352
00:25:44,157 --> 00:25:46,279
We come in peace.

353
00:25:48,202 --> 00:25:49,613
Always wanted to say that.

354
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,416
Fletcher, inform the Navy
we've gained access. . .

355
00:25:57,671 --> 00:25:59,497
... to the spacecraft.

356
00:25:59,797 --> 00:26:02,370
There's a hell of a lot of
radiation shielding in here.

357
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:07,471
Huge grids of catwalks and plumbing. . .

358
00:26:09,473 --> 00:26:11,217
. . .and a lot of steam.

359
00:26:12,768 --> 00:26:15,343
It's endless.
We'll stay in touch here.

360
00:26:27,283 --> 00:26:28,398
Somebody's been here.

361
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:32,324
There's footsteps
and they ain't ours.

362
00:26:37,044 --> 00:26:38,787
So what do you say, Norman?
Time to turn back?

363
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:40,379
I'm a little curious.

364
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:44,172
Break up into 2 squads. We'll
never cover the territory otherwise.

365
00:26:44,426 --> 00:26:45,339
Split up?

366
00:26:45,593 --> 00:26:49,294
He's got a point. We've only got about
a half-hour of breathing time left.

367
00:26:49,556 --> 00:26:51,679
Ted and Harry,
you come with me.

368
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:54,851
Beth, Norman, stick together.
Come on.

369
00:26:55,604 --> 00:26:58,060
I think the people who built this place
would call that "divide and conquer. "

370
00:26:58,273 --> 00:27:01,642
Whoever built this thing wanted us dead,
we'd be dead already.

371
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:07,987
These guys offer a federal grant to
study the effects of an alien invasion.

372
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:09,901
I told all this to Harry.

373
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,440
You made up the report?

374
00:27:11,704 --> 00:27:14,241
No, not all of it. I mean,
I did research on half of it.

375
00:27:14,456 --> 00:27:15,619
Who did the other half?

376
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:19,166
I borrowed from, you know,
good writers.

377
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:21,791
Isaac Asimov, Rod Serling. . . .

378
00:27:22,631 --> 00:27:23,794
Rod Serling?

379
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:28,212
Who would've thought anyone even reads
those government reports. You know?

380
00:27:28,471 --> 00:27:31,257
I show up here,
half the Pacific fleet is here.

381
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:34,593
I just didn't know what to do.
I wanted to tell you, that's all.

382
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Is this in the same category as,
"Beth, I thought you knew I was married"?
I don't think we have enough oxygen--

383
00:27:48,616 --> 00:27:51,154
-Oh, my God.
-Did you push something?

384
00:27:51,869 --> 00:27:53,529
No. It did it on its own.

385
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:25,147
That must be the cockpit.

386
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:27,518
Hold on.

387
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:34,905
Look at this. Cross-stress bracing
on the outer hulls.

388
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:37,285
All axes supported.
Look at this stuff.

389
00:28:37,624 --> 00:28:41,158
This is interesting.
Soft and strong at the same time.

390
00:28:41,418 --> 00:28:44,290
It's, like, better than rubber,
better than steel.

391
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,917
You know a lot
about this stuff.

392
00:28:46,173 --> 00:28:48,664
I studied aeronautical engineering
at M.I.T.

393
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,670
Isn't that where you got your Ph.D.?

394
00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:53,384
It's where I got mine.
All 3 of them.

395
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:54,802
I hated M.I.T.

396
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:55,680
Envy?

397
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:56,680
Puberty.

398
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:57,717
How old?

399
00:28:58,227 --> 00:28:59,852
First Ph.D., 1 8.

400
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,053
Damn.

401
00:29:01,314 --> 00:29:03,556
One year, Harry.
You beat me by one year.

402
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:05,483
Let's push on.

403
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:06,767
Let's go.

404
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:10,397
Man, they didn't tell you how heavy
these things were out of the water.

405
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,941
Look at this.

406
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:16,573
Come here.

407
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,114
"Trash. "

408
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:23,540
"Basura. "

409
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:25,999
Trash?

410
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

411
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:40,924
Oh, God.

412
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:45,522
Jesus!

413
00:29:47,528 --> 00:29:49,070
It's human.

414
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:51,442
You mean humanoid.

415
00:29:52,949 --> 00:29:54,609
No, Norman, I mean human.

416
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,191
Blunt force trauma.

417
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,075
You can see by the direction
that the fracture runs. . .

418
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:00,867
. . .that he was hit
in the back of the head.

419
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:02,573
What's in his hand?

420
00:30:03,126 --> 00:30:04,502
I don't know.

421
00:30:07,548 --> 00:30:08,876
What is it?

422
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,422
"Smokehouse Almonds"?

423
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,756
My God, it's an American spaceship.

424
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:20,678
It can't be
an American spaceship.

425
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:23,724
It's 300 years old. There weren't
even Americans, let alone spaceships.

426
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:25,973
It can't be, but it is.

427
00:30:26,317 --> 00:30:30,184
Let's see if there's some kind of
flight recorder or data computer. . .

428
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:32,771
. . .where we can ring up
some kind. . .

429
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,941
. . .of a flight history.
I mean. . . .

430
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:42,536
Look at this. It's in English.
Come here.

431
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:46,998
Okay, good.

432
00:30:48,005 --> 00:30:49,381
Right there.

433
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,209
And there.

434
00:30:57,931 --> 00:30:59,675
Look at the dates!

435
00:31:00,517 --> 00:31:01,514
Can't be.

436
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,766
Could be.

437
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:06,228
It could be 2043 or 1 643.

438
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:08,190
I don't know
which one is weirder.

439
00:31:14,948 --> 00:31:18,199
"Unknown Entry Event. "
Press it.

440
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You sure?

441
00:32:27,522 --> 00:32:29,017
This is Barnes, Norman.

442
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:31,183
Yeah, I can hear you.

443
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:37,482
I can't explain it, but I think
we're inside an American spaceship.

444
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:40,116
It gets better.

445
00:32:47,084 --> 00:32:48,364
What the hell is it?

446
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:52,043
Whatever it is, it seems to be
what this bird was designed to do.

447
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:56,081
Go out into space and gather
things like this up and bring it back.

448
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:57,921
Yeah, but back from where?

449
00:32:58,178 --> 00:32:59,673
Don't get too excited, Ted.

450
00:33:00,347 --> 00:33:03,383
Turn this thing over,
it'll probably say "Made in Korea. "

451
00:33:03,642 --> 00:33:05,185
Somehow I doubt that.

452
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,848
No doors.

453
00:33:07,104 --> 00:33:09,144
No hinges of any kind.

454
00:33:10,775 --> 00:33:15,152
I'll bet if you put a laser micrometer
on this, it'd be a perfect sphere.

455
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:20,109
Perfect to a thousandth of an inch.
That's a message in and of itself.

456
00:33:20,493 --> 00:33:22,153
-Really?
-What do you mean?

457
00:33:23,495 --> 00:33:27,659
When Pope Benedict asked Giotto
to prove his worth as an artist. . .

458
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:31,170
. . .Giotto drew a perfect circle. . .

459
00:33:31,545 --> 00:33:33,039
. . .freehand.

460
00:33:33,714 --> 00:33:36,252
Perfection.
It's a powerful message.

461
00:33:36,717 --> 00:33:40,051
-I know what the Zen masters would say.
-What's that?

462
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:43,178
"This ball wants to be caught. "

463
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,595
Nobody built this thing
looking into their third eye.

464
00:33:46,852 --> 00:33:49,557
They went to a lot of trouble
and they didn't do it for nothing.

465
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:53,064
Something put this thing out there
to get picked up and brought back here.

466
00:33:53,401 --> 00:33:56,437
Have you forgotten the Trojan horse?
It could be a trap.

467
00:33:56,696 --> 00:33:58,404
Don't you think
that's a little paranoid?

468
00:33:59,157 --> 00:34:02,277
No, I'm going to put a video camera
on this thing and keep an eye on it.

469
00:34:03,327 --> 00:34:06,114
Can I ask you something
about this reflective surface?

470
00:34:06,497 --> 00:34:08,621
Yeah, it appears to be mercury,
doesn't it?

471
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:11,200
Except mercury's liquid
at this temperature.

472
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,085
That's not what I'm talking about.

473
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:17,247
What worries me is that
it's reflecting everything but us.

474
00:34:21,554 --> 00:34:24,804
I hate to be the one non-scientist
that picks this up, guys.

475
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:26,797
You know what I mean?

476
00:34:28,394 --> 00:34:29,972
What do you think it is?

477
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,138
I don't know.

478
00:34:34,108 --> 00:34:35,686
Whatever it is. . .

479
00:34:36,903 --> 00:34:38,231
. . .it's alien.

480
00:34:46,996 --> 00:34:50,163
Okay, an American spacecraft,
materials, technology. . .

481
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:53,086
. . .more advanced than what we know,
crashes into the ocean.

482
00:34:53,336 --> 00:34:54,451
Why wasn't it damaged?

483
00:34:54,796 --> 00:34:57,465
The materials are
obviously super-strong.

484
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,838
If that's true, why did it chip
when you hit it?

485
00:35:05,598 --> 00:35:06,678
Better:

486
00:35:07,016 --> 00:35:08,511
It didn't crash.

487
00:35:09,102 --> 00:35:10,430
It arrived. . .

488
00:35:10,854 --> 00:35:12,396
. . .300 years ago.

489
00:35:12,647 --> 00:35:14,806
-From where?
-Not "where. " When.

490
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:17,522
So you're saying this thing
took a wrong turn?

491
00:35:17,778 --> 00:35:19,770
That's right.
I mean, what if the craft. . .

492
00:35:20,029 --> 00:35:22,271
. . .inadvertently flew
into a black hole?

493
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:25,284
It arrived in our past from its present.

494
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:26,994
The dates
in the flight record--

495
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:28,656
43, 47.

496
00:35:28,998 --> 00:35:31,322
That has to be 2043, 2047.

497
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:33,742
The image you saw,
what you described. . .

498
00:35:34,002 --> 00:35:36,244
. . .sounds like a black hole,
a tear in the space--

499
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:38,047
We know
what a black hole is.

500
00:35:38,298 --> 00:35:39,377
I don't know.

501
00:35:39,633 --> 00:35:43,465
It's a collapsed star with so much
gravity it's like a vacuum cleaner. . .

502
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,638
. . .sucking everything into it,
light, interstellar dust, time--

503
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,929
-Time?
-It's possible, but not plausible.

504
00:35:49,184 --> 00:35:51,854
It's more than probable.
It's rudimentary astrophysics.

505
00:35:52,103 --> 00:35:54,809
We just haven't been able
to fly into one and prove it.

506
00:36:13,209 --> 00:36:17,289
I just got off the horn topside.
They're expecting a bad blow up there.

507
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:19,289
And they're pulling us out.

508
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,674
Pulling us out? Wait a minute!
What do you mean?

509
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,753
What part of "pull out"
don't you understand?

510
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,761
Extraction.
We're leaving.

511
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,557
That's ridiculous. We haven't even
begun to scratch the surface here.

512
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,270
If you've ever seen a Pacific cyclone,
what we call a tornado is a little fart.

513
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,773
So I suggest you go back
to the dormitory and take a nap.

514
00:36:39,026 --> 00:36:41,943
You need to lower your metabolism
before we start the decompression.

515
00:36:42,196 --> 00:36:45,113
You're leaving a time-traveling
spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean?

516
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:46,776
I'm just following my orders.

517
00:36:47,035 --> 00:36:49,656
We're the aliens' Welcome Wagons.
But, no aliens.

518
00:36:49,912 --> 00:36:51,739
-It was made in America.
-What's your point?

519
00:36:51,998 --> 00:36:54,952
My point is, I'm a biochemist
and there's no life down here.

520
00:36:55,418 --> 00:36:56,581
What is wrong with you?!

521
00:36:56,836 --> 00:36:59,623
That doesn't mean there's
nothing to learn, to explore!

522
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:00,876
She's right.

523
00:37:01,132 --> 00:37:04,667
You guys are the human contact team
for an Unknown Life Form.

524
00:37:04,927 --> 00:37:08,343
There is no Unknown Life Form,
so we pull out at 0900.

525
00:37:08,598 --> 00:37:10,389
-Please say something to him.
-What?

526
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:12,800
I don't know. Do you not have
an opinion about this?

527
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:14,348
I'm delighted
we're going back up top.

528
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:16,177
You know what I mean?

529
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:19,226
This may look like a roadside diner,
but in the meantime. . .

530
00:37:19,484 --> 00:37:22,236
. . .my ears won't pop and if I pull
this thing away from my neck. . .

531
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:25,772
. . .I sound like someone's squeezing
my testicles. Let's go home.

532
00:37:31,204 --> 00:37:32,995
Barnes is wrong, you know.

533
00:37:33,665 --> 00:37:35,622
You mean,
wrong about the storm?

534
00:37:36,835 --> 00:37:38,993
No, about the Sphere.

535
00:37:39,963 --> 00:37:41,338
What about the Sphere?

536
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,870
It's alive.

537
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:53,683
Why do you say that?

538
00:37:56,229 --> 00:37:57,807
There's something inside it.

539
00:37:59,107 --> 00:38:02,191
How can there be anything inside it?
There's no door, no seams.

540
00:38:03,027 --> 00:38:06,480
The Sphere chooses what it will
and won't reflect.

541
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,860
Doesn't that seem like the actions
of a conscious being to you?

542
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,534
Pop psychology. I think,
for whatever it's worth, you're angry. . .

543
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,328
. . .towards our friend Ted in there. . .

544
00:38:18,585 --> 00:38:20,708
. . .because he figured this out
before you did.

545
00:38:23,674 --> 00:38:24,752
You really think so?

546
00:38:25,217 --> 00:38:27,459
I don't know. This is
my first underwater session.

547
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:34,799
You're right.

548
00:38:36,478 --> 00:38:38,720
Ted did figure it out first,
didn't he?

549
00:38:39,815 --> 00:38:41,144
Good shrinkage.

550
00:38:49,491 --> 00:38:51,863
We're all going to die down here,
you know.

551
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:55,451
What?

552
00:38:56,915 --> 00:38:57,995
What?

553
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:03,329
You see, it's curious.

554
00:39:04,798 --> 00:39:06,127
Ted did figure it out.

555
00:39:06,425 --> 00:39:09,960
Time travel. And when we get back,
we're going to tell everyone. . .

556
00:39:10,221 --> 00:39:13,506
. . .how it's possible, how it's done,
what the dangers are.

557
00:39:13,765 --> 00:39:16,885
But why 50 years in the future, when the
spacecraft encounters a black hole. . .

558
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:19,683
. . .does the computer call it
an "Unknown Entry Event"?

559
00:39:19,939 --> 00:39:21,398
Why don't they know?

560
00:39:21,983 --> 00:39:22,813
If they don't know. . .

561
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,602
. . .it means we never told anyone.

562
00:39:25,861 --> 00:39:27,854
And if we never told anyone. . .

563
00:39:28,113 --> 00:39:30,237
. . .it means we never made it back.

564
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:31,606
Hence. . .

565
00:39:31,909 --> 00:39:33,866
. . .we die down here.

566
00:39:34,453 --> 00:39:37,074
Just as a matter
of deductive logic, Norman.

567
00:39:44,631 --> 00:39:47,631
Damn, I wish I could
get inside that Sphere.

568
00:39:58,644 --> 00:40:00,269
-What's wrong?
-Talk to Mr. Barnes.

569
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:02,063
-Where is he?
-Video feed room.

570
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:05,020
Where is that? I don't know
where the hell anything is.

571
00:40:05,568 --> 00:40:06,766
Where am l?

572
00:40:07,195 --> 00:40:08,523
Where?

573
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:10,860
What's going on?

574
00:40:11,032 --> 00:40:12,490
I don't know.
You tell me.

575
00:40:16,495 --> 00:40:18,572
-What the hell is he doing?
-I don't know.

576
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:20,824
Do you know what he's doing?

577
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:22,875
-I need to know what you know.
-Nothing.

578
00:40:23,128 --> 00:40:24,290
He wanted to go inside.

579
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:26,669
We are inside.
You mean outside?

580
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:29,593
-He said, "inside. "
-What? lnside the spacecraft?

581
00:40:29,843 --> 00:40:32,049
I think inside the Sphere.

582
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,929
Holy shit!

583
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:26,890
My God.

584
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,480
Did he go inside?

585
00:41:30,278 --> 00:41:32,153
-I don't think so.
-What the hell's going on?

586
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,395
He didn't just disappear.

587
00:41:33,615 --> 00:41:35,822
I think it's a glitch in the video.

588
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,820
Give me playback on that.

589
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,579
You'll have it in a minute.

590
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,615
You knew he was doing this
and you said nothing.

591
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:44,373
-You didn't think!
-I didn't think it possible.

592
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,664
Where are Beth and Ted?

593
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:49,876
I don't know. I woke up, I heard
bells ringing and I started running--

594
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,089
I'm not getting an image
on the sub.

595
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,879
Impossible!
I got a cable in my quarters!

596
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,466
They'll be here in 25 minutes or less!

597
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,635
The only logical explanation
is that the sub is still at the surface.

598
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,927
Is it also logically possible
your sonar is messed up?!

599
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,977
Let's just calm down, all right?

600
00:42:04,229 --> 00:42:06,899
He didn't just disappear.
We are not going to leave him.

601
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:11,017
You got that right. I am not going to
lose a civilian on my watch.

602
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,355
You have just screwed up
our trip to the surface.

603
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,983
We are not going up to the surface.

604
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,032
Harry!
We are not going up!

605
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,785
Harry!
Can you hear me?

606
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,744
Harry, can you hear me?

607
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,117
Norman, this is not a triage situation.

608
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,456
Go find me Ted and Beth.

609
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,884
Norman, stop.

610
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,238
Still no reading on the sub.

611
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,859
Forget the goddamn sonar, Teeny.

612
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,284
When Beth and Ted get here, make sure
they don 't go anywhere. All right?

613
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,379
What the hell?

614
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:53,995
Can you hear me?

615
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:10,137
Is he alive?

616
00:44:10,608 --> 00:44:13,774
We have a problem.
Harry's out cold. His pulse is normal.

617
00:44:14,236 --> 00:44:16,394
All his vitals are normal...

618
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,232
. . .but I don't get it.

619
00:44:36,592 --> 00:44:38,216
Hello. Hello!

620
00:44:47,395 --> 00:44:51,891
Norman, can you hear me?
We lost video here. Can you hear me?

621
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,686
-That tears it.
-What, sir?

622
00:44:57,321 --> 00:44:58,650
We're on internal power.

623
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:00,272
I don 't follow you.

624
00:45:00,783 --> 00:45:04,781
They cut us loose, Teeny.
For some reason the sub turned back.

625
00:45:05,121 --> 00:45:07,078
Break out your 5-day deodorant pads.

626
00:45:07,331 --> 00:45:09,123
We're here for the duration.

627
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:19,963
Everything's normal.

628
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:29,309
What's going on?
ls he all right?

629
00:45:29,812 --> 00:45:32,137
Is it true? Did he go inside?
What did he say?

630
00:45:33,649 --> 00:45:35,607
He didn't say.
He's aphasic.

631
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,236
He's asleep, Ted.

632
00:45:37,445 --> 00:45:40,362
I can't believe he went inside.
He didn't say anything?

633
00:45:40,698 --> 00:45:43,024
There's no door, no entry.
How did he get in?

634
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:54,084
Can I have your attention, please?

635
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:56,211
We've lost contact with the surface.

636
00:45:56,548 --> 00:45:59,798
The Habitat is now operating
solely under internal power.

637
00:46:00,384 --> 00:46:02,840
We have plenty of food, oxygen
and fresh water...

638
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:05,053
... to sustain us
until the storm is over...

639
00:46:05,264 --> 00:46:07,934
...and we reestablish contact
with the surface.

640
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:11,601
But until that time,
this mission is subject...

641
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,222
. . .to emergency authority
under my command.

642
00:46:42,386 --> 00:46:44,177
I'm taking this out
to the mini-sub.

643
00:46:44,387 --> 00:46:47,223
-Are you up on the duty roster?
-Yes, sir.

644
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,722
Where's she going?

645
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:54,353
It's procedures.
Everything in the Habitat is videoed.

646
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:59,727
Every 1 2 hours we take the videos to
the mini-sub and press the reset button.

647
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:03,239
The idea is, if something happens to us
and we don't reset it. . .

648
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:06,242
. . .the sub goes to the surface
automatically.

649
00:47:06,494 --> 00:47:10,538
If we're all dead, they at least have
a partial record of what went wrong.

650
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:12,993
Cheerful thought, huh?

651
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:15,579
Mind the store a minute.

652
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:18,337
I'm going to the head.

653
00:48:00,673 --> 00:48:02,132
What the hell's that?

654
00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:13,517
It's so beautiful down here.

655
00:48:13,937 --> 00:48:15,728
It's so tranquil.

656
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:19,728
This is beautiful.

657
00:48:19,942 --> 00:48:22,813
It's hard to believe we have a typhoon
1 ,000 feet above our heads.

658
00:48:23,821 --> 00:48:26,028
Hey, it's snowing down here.

659
00:48:27,033 --> 00:48:28,990
You see them?
There's got to be a million...

660
00:48:29,202 --> 00:48:30,660
. . .jellyfish down here.

661
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:33,780
Man, this is really beautiful.

662
00:48:36,668 --> 00:48:39,538
These jellyfish are getting
a little friendly.

663
00:48:40,422 --> 00:48:42,213
Having a hard time seeing.

664
00:48:43,842 --> 00:48:47,293
Hey, guys, you getting this?
It's getting thick down here.

665
00:48:47,553 --> 00:48:49,096
Hello, hello.

666
00:48:52,183 --> 00:48:53,559
I can 't see what I'm doing.

667
00:48:56,688 --> 00:48:58,727
They're sticking to my faceplate.

668
00:48:59,066 --> 00:49:02,730
Fletcher, this is Dr. Fielding. Just
swim through them. They're harmless.

669
00:49:04,237 --> 00:49:07,108
Guys, these jellyfish are everywhere.

670
00:49:08,534 --> 00:49:10,325
Fletcher, get out of there.

671
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,362
What are jellyfish doing at 1 ,000 feet?

672
00:49:12,621 --> 00:49:15,029
I think they feel
the heat from my body.

673
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,375
I can't get them off me!

674
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:22,710
They're stinging through my suit!

675
00:49:22,964 --> 00:49:24,792
Get back to the Habitat
on the double.

676
00:49:26,009 --> 00:49:27,883
I can't move my legs!

677
00:49:29,555 --> 00:49:30,634
Come back to the Habitat.

678
00:49:31,098 --> 00:49:32,889
They're inside my suit!

679
00:49:34,017 --> 00:49:35,808
Keep moving!
Just keep moving!

680
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:45,444
Help me!

681
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,848
Jesus, Barnes, she's dead!
There's no bubbles.

682
00:50:33,285 --> 00:50:34,281
Edmunds.

683
00:50:34,494 --> 00:50:35,277
Yes, sir?

684
00:50:35,788 --> 00:50:37,330
Come on down here.

685
00:50:37,832 --> 00:50:38,946
Something...

686
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:40,750
...happened to Fletcher.

687
00:51:10,281 --> 00:51:11,312
God!

688
00:51:14,202 --> 00:51:17,120
When I was 5 years old
I went out on a boat with my father.

689
00:51:17,872 --> 00:51:21,490
He told me not to jump in the water,
so of course I did and. . . .

690
00:51:24,379 --> 00:51:26,336
Oh, my!

691
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,378
I jumped right into a school
of these guys.

692
00:51:29,717 --> 00:51:31,259
Not this big, though.

693
00:51:32,345 --> 00:51:35,797
I think every one had a shot at me.
I don't know what this lady felt. . .

694
00:51:36,057 --> 00:51:39,889
. . .but, man, it went beyond pain.
I've been. . .

695
00:51:40,937 --> 00:51:42,052
. . .afraid of them since.

696
00:51:42,314 --> 00:51:45,564
Would you feel any better if I told you
this wasn't exactly a jellyfish?

697
00:51:45,817 --> 00:51:46,481
You mean. . .?

698
00:51:47,527 --> 00:51:50,362
I mean, jellyfish like this
are unheard of.

699
00:51:50,738 --> 00:51:54,238
I don't know what this is,
but it isn't God's creation.

700
00:52:06,922 --> 00:52:10,373
Here I am
Your special island

701
00:52:12,344 --> 00:52:14,171
Come to me

702
00:52:17,265 --> 00:52:18,890
Bali Ha 'i

703
00:52:30,654 --> 00:52:32,065
You can come in.

704
00:52:36,744 --> 00:52:39,317
Have a seat.
You want some coffee?

705
00:52:39,746 --> 00:52:41,905
-No, thanks.
-How well do you know Dr. Halperin?

706
00:52:42,165 --> 00:52:45,701
I used to teach at UC San Diego
years ago. She came for her master's.

707
00:52:45,961 --> 00:52:50,124
Don't take it personally, but I assume
she wasn't a romantic interest.

708
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:51,662
Don't take what personally?

709
00:52:51,926 --> 00:52:53,918
She's a tall, vibrant,
younger woman.

710
00:52:54,177 --> 00:52:55,174
What's your point?

711
00:52:55,304 --> 00:52:56,502
You knew her as a patient.

712
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:59,260
I'm not at liberty to discuss that.
You understand.

713
00:52:59,516 --> 00:53:03,015
I understand an exotic-gas environment
1 ,000 feet under water. . .

714
00:53:03,271 --> 00:53:04,645
. . .with no lifeline to the surface. . .

715
00:53:04,897 --> 00:53:07,732
. . .is about the most dangerous
environment on the planet.

716
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:09,941
If there's a problem,
I got to know about it.

717
00:53:10,528 --> 00:53:12,603
-Beth is fine.
-"Beth is fine. "

718
00:53:13,114 --> 00:53:14,489
-Beth's fine.
-She's very fine.

719
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,527
Would you like to read this
and tell me what it says?

720
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,866
-Are these my actual notes?
-What does it say?

721
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,784
-How in the world did you get--
-Does it say "suicide attempt"?

722
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,828
"Electroshock therapy"?
lsn't that what it says?

723
00:53:26,085 --> 00:53:26,915
What's your point?

724
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:29,458
Didn't it seem important enough
to tell somebody?

725
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:31,711
You were willing to jeopardize
these people's lives. . .

726
00:53:31,966 --> 00:53:35,002
. . .to have someone here
who could be mentally unstable?

727
00:53:35,303 --> 00:53:36,761
Are you aware of the term,
"overreact"?

728
00:53:36,971 --> 00:53:38,251
We're 1 60 fathoms down.

729
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:41,385
And we've got a nutbag down here
who can flip out and crack up.

730
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,759
You selected the team.
Why didn't you tell me?

731
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:46,475
When I wrote this, I didn't know
the team would be 1 ,000--

732
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:50,817
1 ,000 or 1 0, it makes no difference!
Why didn't you tell me about Beth?

733
00:53:51,068 --> 00:53:52,099
It wasn't pertinent.

734
00:53:52,278 --> 00:53:53,736
That was not your call to make!

735
00:53:53,988 --> 00:53:56,111
Yes, it was and it still is.
It was a passive attempt.

736
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:57,315
A passive attempt?!

737
00:53:57,575 --> 00:54:01,158
Those who really want to kill themselves
shoot themselves or go over a bridge.

738
00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:04,911
They don't call their boyfriend and say,
"I just took 20 Nebutol. Help me. "

739
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:08,161
She took 20 yellows,
and you're telling me she's perfect.

740
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,499
What is it?
Come in.

741
00:54:12,006 --> 00:54:12,836
It's Harry.

742
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:14,212
What?
He's awake?

743
00:54:14,425 --> 00:54:15,374
He's really awake.

744
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:19,345
Man, oh, man!

745
00:54:20,723 --> 00:54:22,218
You're going to have
a problem with me.

746
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:25,518
If my good buddy Norman keeps cooking
like this, I ain't going nowhere.

747
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,264
This toast is good.

748
00:54:27,856 --> 00:54:29,765
Bacon? Better.

749
00:54:30,025 --> 00:54:34,153
But these eggs!
These eggs are fantastic!

750
00:54:34,988 --> 00:54:37,064
Norman, what did you put
in these eggs?

751
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:39,571
No, no, wait.
Don't tell me.

752
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:43,033
Parsley.

753
00:54:43,288 --> 00:54:45,861
Chives.
Tarragon and. . . .

754
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:47,656
What is that?

755
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,044
Chervil?
ls that chervil?

756
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:51,416
Yes, it is.

757
00:54:51,672 --> 00:54:53,747
I'm glad you like it, Harry.

758
00:54:54,007 --> 00:54:55,715
I love eggs!

759
00:54:57,844 --> 00:54:59,338
They sure seem
to cheer you up.

760
00:54:59,554 --> 00:55:01,132
Do you remember what happened?

761
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:04,641
Yeah. I went inside.

762
00:55:04,976 --> 00:55:07,467
How did you get inside?
There are no doors.

763
00:55:07,896 --> 00:55:11,431
There are doors all over this place
and we can't get out.

764
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:13,566
-We're still here.
-Yes, we are.

765
00:55:13,819 --> 00:55:15,527
You didn't answer my question.

766
00:55:17,989 --> 00:55:19,400
Why are you looking
at me like that?

767
00:55:21,827 --> 00:55:24,234
Harry, are you saying
we shouldn't still be here?

768
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,036
Where's Teeny?
I thought she did all the cooking.

769
00:55:27,332 --> 00:55:30,499
She had an unfortunate accident, Harry.
She was killed.

770
00:55:31,503 --> 00:55:33,330
Killed? How?

771
00:55:35,132 --> 00:55:36,626
Jellyfish.

772
00:55:39,261 --> 00:55:40,804
Jellyfish?

773
00:55:41,263 --> 00:55:42,212
That's strange.

774
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:44,051
Yes, it is strange, isn't it?

775
00:55:44,809 --> 00:55:46,053
Here you go, Harry.

776
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:50,514
-Little onion rings. Look at that.
-It's not onion rings.

777
00:55:50,773 --> 00:55:52,184
Good, though.

778
00:55:52,691 --> 00:55:53,854
Guess what it is.

779
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:55,064
Calamari!

780
00:55:59,865 --> 00:56:01,276
You all right?

781
00:56:02,577 --> 00:56:04,236
Cough, cough, cough.

782
00:56:04,954 --> 00:56:07,575
-No, you're doing it wrong.
-I know what I'm doing.

783
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:08,696
Bring it up.

784
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:10,865
Come on, bring it up.

785
00:56:11,419 --> 00:56:14,123
He's trying to say something.
He's trying to talk.

786
00:56:15,798 --> 00:56:18,087
You don't listen.
He wants to say something!

787
00:56:19,134 --> 00:56:21,460
-I'm not choking, you asshole!
-See?

788
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:23,096
I hate squid.

789
00:56:25,641 --> 00:56:27,218
I hate squid.

790
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:31,598
I'm sorry.

791
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:33,433
I was trying to help.

792
00:56:39,406 --> 00:56:40,354
You okay?

793
00:56:42,825 --> 00:56:44,617
Harry, let me ask you something.

794
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:49,452
Before you went in the Sphere,
you were convinced we would die here.

795
00:56:50,917 --> 00:56:52,328
Yeah, I remember that.

796
00:56:55,088 --> 00:56:56,286
You still believe it?

797
00:57:00,218 --> 00:57:02,341
You afraid of dying, Norman?

798
00:57:25,743 --> 00:57:28,199
Bullshit!
He's hiding something and you know it.

799
00:57:28,455 --> 00:57:31,372
He went inside the Sphere and whatever
it is he saw, he won't tell us.

800
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:34,376
-He said he doesn't remember anything.
-You bought that?

801
00:57:35,629 --> 00:57:37,586
The whole food thing
was all a diversion.

802
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,923
The guy's willing to put
all of our lives on the line. . .

803
00:57:41,176 --> 00:57:43,299
. . .because he doesn't want
to share information.

804
00:57:43,553 --> 00:57:47,005
I can see it. He's making notes for a
book. He wants to win the Nobel Prize.

805
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,506
And you don't?

806
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:53,521
Norman, you've known me
since I was 1 7 years old.

807
00:57:53,772 --> 00:57:55,812
I would love to be
the guy who gets--

808
00:57:56,066 --> 00:57:57,395
Do you know
how respected--

809
00:57:57,651 --> 00:58:02,562
I'm not! I've written one
"Fun With Dick and Jane" book on physics.

810
00:58:02,822 --> 00:58:04,317
I mean, Niels Bohr. . .

811
00:58:04,575 --> 00:58:08,358
. . .he published "The Quantum Theory
of Atomic Structure" at 28.

812
00:58:08,621 --> 00:58:12,155
Einstein, relativity, 26.
Newton, gravity, 23.

813
00:58:12,415 --> 00:58:16,081
In physics, if you haven't done it
by 35, chances are you never will.

814
00:58:16,336 --> 00:58:20,085
This doesn't have anything to do
with your competitiveness with Harry?

815
00:58:20,883 --> 00:58:22,342
1 9. Wunderkind!

816
00:58:22,593 --> 00:58:23,968
I rest my case.

817
00:58:24,553 --> 00:58:26,130
Mr. Barnes would like to see you.

818
00:58:26,347 --> 00:58:27,093
Why?

819
00:58:27,306 --> 00:58:29,298
Something's wrong
with the computer system.

820
00:58:38,651 --> 00:58:41,735
-Try purging it.
-I tried. It just keeps coming back.

821
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,613
Discharge from the buffer memory?

822
00:58:43,822 --> 00:58:45,696
I ruled that out.

823
00:58:46,409 --> 00:58:49,612
The helium is getting to the chips.
It's probably a saturation effect.

824
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:53,204
-If that's true, what are our options?
-You have to change all the chips.

825
00:58:53,457 --> 00:58:56,660
Forget it. Run this place on manual?
It's going to be a long 4 days.

826
00:58:57,003 --> 00:58:58,331
Hey, boss.

827
00:59:00,048 --> 00:59:02,621
-Figured that out yet?
-It's a saturation effect.

828
00:59:02,883 --> 00:59:06,963
I don't think so. If it's a saturation
effect, it would be random.

829
00:59:07,596 --> 00:59:08,675
What do you mean?

830
00:59:09,015 --> 00:59:11,090
This has a pattern.

831
00:59:19,191 --> 00:59:20,852
See? It's like a code.

832
00:59:21,152 --> 00:59:22,611
A code from where?

833
00:59:24,822 --> 00:59:25,736
How'd you do that?

834
00:59:26,032 --> 00:59:26,897
How'd you see that?

835
00:59:27,116 --> 00:59:28,361
Try binary.

836
00:59:36,126 --> 00:59:37,703
See? Letter breaks.

837
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:50,386
You think this is coming
from the Sphere?

838
00:59:50,724 --> 00:59:51,755
Don't know.

839
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:56,430
This mission is ultra top-secret.
What you translate is for my eyes only.

840
00:59:58,231 --> 01:00:01,185
If you were it,
how would you know our alphabet?

841
01:00:01,443 --> 01:00:03,685
Same way it's configured on a keyboard.

842
01:00:03,987 --> 01:00:07,402
But reflected in an orb,
spherically.

843
01:00:07,907 --> 01:00:10,196
A keyboard, but spherical.

844
01:00:10,786 --> 01:00:12,245
Take a keyboard. . .

845
01:00:12,496 --> 01:00:13,871
. . .wrap it around a sphere. . .

846
01:00:14,122 --> 01:00:16,909
. . .then starting at the center key, G,
number the letters. . .

847
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:19,041
. . .spiraling out.

848
01:00:19,753 --> 01:00:21,828
-You the man!
-I still got it.

849
01:00:22,172 --> 01:00:23,880
I still got the juice.

850
01:00:30,472 --> 01:00:31,587
Keyboard.

851
01:00:32,307 --> 01:00:33,386
They let you keep those?

852
01:00:34,184 --> 01:00:35,595
Here, you want them?

853
01:00:38,814 --> 01:00:41,102
All we got to do now
is plug in the numbers.

854
01:01:07,426 --> 01:01:08,589
Friends. . .

855
01:01:09,052 --> 01:01:13,382
. . .in the 8,000 years
of recorded history, this is a first.

856
01:01:14,141 --> 01:01:17,759
You're now on-line
with an alien intelligence.

857
01:01:18,562 --> 01:01:21,350
You got to be kidding.
You must've messed up the translation.

858
01:01:21,565 --> 01:01:22,561
I don't think so.

859
01:01:22,774 --> 01:01:25,348
If this is right,
this alien sounds like an idiot.

860
01:01:26,779 --> 01:01:29,898
That's something to consider.
A stupid alien. They must have them.

861
01:01:30,241 --> 01:01:34,618
I will admit the message is childlike,
but actually it's quite perfect.

862
01:01:34,912 --> 01:01:37,154
It's short, to the point,
non-threatening. . .

863
01:01:37,415 --> 01:01:40,166
. . .kind of the way you talk
to a small child or a dog.

864
01:01:42,628 --> 01:01:44,004
Look at this.

865
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:47,338
He's making a speech.

866
01:01:58,811 --> 01:02:00,270
Ask him for his last name.

867
01:02:00,521 --> 01:02:01,386
What?

868
01:02:01,648 --> 01:02:04,020
I want a full name for my report.

869
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:08,269
I'm not putting in my report I lost
a crew member on a deepsat expedition. . .

870
01:02:08,529 --> 01:02:09,988
. . .to find an alien named Jerry.

871
01:02:10,197 --> 01:02:11,229
Please! "Jerry"?

872
01:02:11,491 --> 01:02:13,780
We ought to tell him
that we're enjoying it too.

873
01:02:14,035 --> 01:02:15,743
Ask him where he's from.

874
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:20,036
Where are you from?

875
01:02:26,548 --> 01:02:29,964
"I make a journey. You make a journey.
We make a journey together. "

876
01:02:30,218 --> 01:02:33,005
I think Jerry's channeling
Deepak Chopra.

877
01:02:33,972 --> 01:02:35,715
A journey from where?

878
01:02:50,071 --> 01:02:51,233
He's happy.

879
01:02:51,823 --> 01:02:52,818
He's crafty.

880
01:02:56,536 --> 01:02:57,449
What happened?

881
01:02:58,163 --> 01:02:59,906
Damn, I think we lost him.

882
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:03,042
We're not alone.

883
01:03:04,002 --> 01:03:05,745
We are definitely. . .

884
01:03:06,004 --> 01:03:07,379
. . .not alone.

885
01:03:07,881 --> 01:03:10,123
It's trying to make contact with us.

886
01:03:10,717 --> 01:03:15,130
Whatever it is, it was inside
that Sphere. Now it's out, free to act.

887
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:16,545
What do you mean by that?

888
01:03:16,806 --> 01:03:18,598
Free to take over our computers. . .

889
01:03:18,851 --> 01:03:22,350
. . .call us on the phone,
come knock on the door if it wants to.

890
01:03:23,522 --> 01:03:24,720
A physical presence.

891
01:03:25,149 --> 01:03:26,477
What are you thinking about?

892
01:03:26,692 --> 01:03:28,352
That last part where he said,
"I am happy. "

893
01:03:28,569 --> 01:03:30,525
Don't you want Jerry to be happy?

894
01:03:30,904 --> 01:03:32,102
Honestly?

895
01:03:32,406 --> 01:03:33,402
What's on your mind?

896
01:03:33,615 --> 01:03:36,735
I would be happy if Jerry
had no emotions whatsoever.

897
01:03:37,077 --> 01:03:39,484
Because the thing of it is,
here's Jerry. . .

898
01:03:39,747 --> 01:03:44,705
. . .an emotional being, cooped up
for 300 years with no one to talk to. . .

899
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,630
. . .none of the socialization,
the emotional growth. . .

900
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,501
. . .that comes from contact
with other emotional beings. . . .

901
01:03:50,883 --> 01:03:52,128
So?

902
01:03:53,093 --> 01:03:55,548
What happens if Jerry gets mad?

903
01:04:15,742 --> 01:04:17,116
What is that sound?

904
01:04:17,368 --> 01:04:18,743
Did you hear it?

905
01:04:19,954 --> 01:04:20,985
You hear that thump?

906
01:04:21,331 --> 01:04:22,575
What is that sound?

907
01:04:23,624 --> 01:04:26,625
Can you hear me?
Did you hear that thump?

908
01:04:27,962 --> 01:04:29,373
You are a hell of a woman.

909
01:04:29,589 --> 01:04:32,459
I wish I knew you in the old days.
Norman told me you were--

910
01:04:32,717 --> 01:04:35,125
Norman told you what?

911
01:04:36,804 --> 01:04:40,719
Let's put it this way,
that if Jerry could read your mind. . .

912
01:04:40,975 --> 01:04:43,051
. . .he'd be bored with ours.

913
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:48,140
What is that sound?

914
01:04:48,941 --> 01:04:50,352
Can you hear me?

915
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:54,904
This is Norman.

916
01:04:55,156 --> 01:04:59,106
I get no answer from Edmunds and there's
strange noises. Something's going on.

917
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,415
It looks like Edmunds is up
on the side of the Habitat.

918
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:20,670
I'm not getting anything on sonar,
but watch yourselves out there.

919
01:05:35,029 --> 01:05:37,069
Would you hit
your callback buttons, please?

920
01:05:37,908 --> 01:05:39,568
What'd you tell Barnes?

921
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:41,399
About what?

922
01:05:42,078 --> 01:05:43,324
About me.

923
01:05:44,747 --> 01:05:48,448
You told him I took 20 Nebutol
and tried to kill myself.

924
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:49,658
Didn't you?

925
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,995
He had my notes.
What do you want me to do?

926
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,379
Did you tell him who I called?

927
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,762
Oh, God.

928
01:06:14,903 --> 01:06:16,101
Come in.

929
01:06:36,342 --> 01:06:38,464
Did you guys find that thumping yet?

930
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:12,538
I don't get it.
What could've done this to her?

931
01:07:18,927 --> 01:07:20,171
My God!

932
01:07:23,347 --> 01:07:24,925
She's like a rag doll.

933
01:07:26,351 --> 01:07:28,676
Her body's been completely pulverized.

934
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,098
My God.

935
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:36,314
"--tentacles 27 feet long.
That would make a formidable monster. "

936
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,648
Let's go. Come on.
What?

937
01:07:46,871 --> 01:07:48,152
What is that?

938
01:07:52,043 --> 01:07:53,453
What does this mean?

939
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,415
Talk to me.

940
01:07:55,755 --> 01:07:57,547
What does this mean, Beth?

941
01:07:57,757 --> 01:07:59,833
There's something up there!

942
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:02,964
Guys, I'm getting
a reading on the sonar.

943
01:08:04,555 --> 01:08:05,884
You're not alone out there.

944
01:08:06,223 --> 01:08:09,593
What the hell makes eggs this size?!
Come on! Jesus, let's go!

945
01:08:09,978 --> 01:08:11,258
All right!

946
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,522
Norman, let's go.
Come on. Let's go!

947
01:08:22,782 --> 01:08:24,325
What the hell is going on?

948
01:08:26,828 --> 01:08:28,655
It's 80 yards and closing.

949
01:08:28,997 --> 01:08:30,372
Get out of there.

950
01:08:32,918 --> 01:08:33,913
What the hell?

951
01:08:35,629 --> 01:08:37,123
What the hell is it?!

952
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,871
Come on, Norman!
Come on, let's go!

953
01:08:40,508 --> 01:08:42,300
60 yards.
How close are you?

954
01:08:45,347 --> 01:08:46,378
What is it?

955
01:08:47,516 --> 01:08:49,342
What the hell is it?!

956
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:51,684
40 yards. Move, move!

957
01:08:52,854 --> 01:08:55,226
Come on. It's something big!
Let's go!

958
01:08:56,024 --> 01:08:58,396
Where is it?
What is it?

959
01:08:59,027 --> 01:09:00,569
20 yards! Move!

960
01:09:32,853 --> 01:09:34,016
I need a report.

961
01:09:34,271 --> 01:09:37,391
I don't know what's going on out there.
There are eggs everywhere.

962
01:09:37,649 --> 01:09:39,309
You should've brought one back.

963
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:42,854
I wasn't up for an Easter egg hunt.
Maybe that's what Edmunds was doing.

964
01:09:43,864 --> 01:09:45,524
I want to talk to Jerry.

965
01:09:52,683 --> 01:09:55,600
If we're going to talk to this thing,
we got to have a game plan.

966
01:09:55,852 --> 01:09:57,050
Specific.

967
01:09:57,271 --> 01:10:00,306
We have to have an objective.
We have to know what we're addressing.

968
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,357
Jesus.

969
01:10:14,205 --> 01:10:15,235
Can you hear me?

970
01:10:17,999 --> 01:10:20,288
You've heard everything
we've talked about.

971
01:10:21,587 --> 01:10:22,831
That's great.

972
01:10:25,383 --> 01:10:26,497
This is Ted here.

973
01:10:28,468 --> 01:10:31,339
I'm the guy who decoded
the keyboard thing that you--

974
01:10:32,056 --> 01:10:33,218
Shut up!

975
01:10:33,474 --> 01:10:35,715
Tell him we need to discuss this alone.

976
01:10:38,979 --> 01:10:39,725
Use your words.

977
01:10:41,482 --> 01:10:42,680
He's mad.

978
01:10:43,025 --> 01:10:45,481
-Use your words.
-Let's just pull the plug.

979
01:10:45,736 --> 01:10:47,065
It may not be that simple.

980
01:10:47,321 --> 01:10:50,072
It's that easy. We leave him alone,
he leaves us alone.

981
01:10:50,324 --> 01:10:52,482
Maybe he doesn't want to be left alone.

982
01:10:52,743 --> 01:10:57,986
He's been down here in isolation
for 300 years. Maybe Jerry's lonely.

983
01:11:03,837 --> 01:11:04,787
What's that?

984
01:11:06,466 --> 01:11:09,170
It's our sonar picking up
something outside.

985
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,722
Jerry, we all think
that you're a fascinating. . .

986
01:11:14,974 --> 01:11:16,006
. . .and wonderful entity. . .

987
01:11:16,267 --> 01:11:20,099
. . .and wish to talk to you for hours.
You know that, don't you?

988
01:11:21,939 --> 01:11:24,146
In your great understanding
and wisdom. . .

989
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,318
. . .you must know that
entities such as ourselves. . .

990
01:11:28,571 --> 01:11:31,442
. . .need to be private.
We have to talk alone sometime.

991
01:11:34,577 --> 01:11:35,905
You know what it is?

992
01:11:41,209 --> 01:11:42,157
Where'd he go?

993
01:11:42,418 --> 01:11:43,533
Shit!

994
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:49,294
Something's clogging everything up
out there.

995
01:11:57,392 --> 01:11:58,637
It's back.

996
01:12:00,353 --> 01:12:02,642
Positive thermals
on the in-line perimeter.

997
01:12:06,067 --> 01:12:07,063
What's that?

998
01:12:07,985 --> 01:12:09,528
Something is hitting the sensor grid.

999
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:11,109
Do we have any defenses?

1000
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:14,693
We can run a high-voltage current
on the skin of the Habitat.

1001
01:12:14,951 --> 01:12:17,158
But every time we try it,
we start an electrical fire.

1002
01:12:17,412 --> 01:12:21,078
Peripheral sensor's activated. I'll try
to image it on the fast-acting sonar.

1003
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:22,782
Building an image.

1004
01:12:23,334 --> 01:12:25,078
80 yards, closing fast.

1005
01:12:25,879 --> 01:12:27,871
Jesus Christ, it's 40 feet long.

1006
01:12:28,298 --> 01:12:29,294
50 yards.

1007
01:12:29,507 --> 01:12:30,622
Re-imaging.

1008
01:12:30,842 --> 01:12:33,547
That's the same image I saw
when you were looking for Edmunds.

1009
01:12:33,803 --> 01:12:35,595
It looks like a giant squid.

1010
01:12:35,889 --> 01:12:39,009
A squid the size of the entire Habitat?
There's no such animal.

1011
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:41,474
That may be,
but that doesn't mean it isn't here.

1012
01:12:42,562 --> 01:12:44,721
Re-imaging. 30 yards.

1013
01:12:46,608 --> 01:12:48,601
What the hell is going on?

1014
01:12:54,616 --> 01:12:57,819
Jerry, if you can hear me,
it's Norman.

1015
01:12:58,078 --> 01:13:00,201
If we've made you angry. . . .

1016
01:13:00,498 --> 01:13:01,612
We got a pressure drop.

1017
01:13:01,832 --> 01:13:03,326
Go to the control room and wait for me!

1018
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:05,208
Just go, please!

1019
01:13:05,836 --> 01:13:07,034
Go! I'll tell you!

1020
01:13:07,921 --> 01:13:10,412
What's that sound?
What is that?

1021
01:13:10,715 --> 01:13:11,961
It sounds like it's right above us.

1022
01:13:12,259 --> 01:13:14,750
I know where it is,
but what is it?

1023
01:13:48,045 --> 01:13:50,714
I'm in the control shaft!
We got a leak in here!

1024
01:13:51,132 --> 01:13:52,590
Hello?!

1025
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,979
Holy shit!

1026
01:14:06,689 --> 01:14:07,768
Do you hear me?

1027
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:12,767
You got to increase the positive
air pressure and drive the water out.

1028
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:16,321
Increase the pressure?
Won't that use up our air supply?

1029
01:14:16,657 --> 01:14:19,658
If the Habitat is full of water,
you'll be dead.

1030
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:21,619
Open the red gate valve.

1031
01:14:24,082 --> 01:14:27,118
The pressure is dropping!
We'll be crushed like a tin can!

1032
01:14:27,502 --> 01:14:30,538
Find the red knob!
It's the only one in the room!

1033
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,161
Got it!

1034
01:14:36,136 --> 01:14:37,215
Good.

1035
01:14:37,804 --> 01:14:39,512
We're getting positive pressure.

1036
01:14:42,684 --> 01:14:43,633
Not too much.

1037
01:14:43,851 --> 01:14:45,394
Start to ease it back.

1038
01:14:57,991 --> 01:14:59,319
Turn it back!

1039
01:14:59,659 --> 01:15:01,698
The pressure is too high!

1040
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,911
We'll explode!
Can you hear me?

1041
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:06,999
Turn it back!

1042
01:15:18,929 --> 01:15:20,126
We're here!

1043
01:15:20,389 --> 01:15:21,171
Jesus!

1044
01:15:21,389 --> 01:15:22,338
Can you hear me?

1045
01:15:22,557 --> 01:15:23,838
I got him!

1046
01:15:25,894 --> 01:15:27,304
Turn the red gate valve.

1047
01:15:27,521 --> 01:15:28,470
Which way?

1048
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:29,844
Clockwise.
Close it.

1049
01:15:36,655 --> 01:15:37,734
Done!

1050
01:15:40,742 --> 01:15:41,988
We're still leaking!

1051
01:15:42,244 --> 01:15:44,616
It's not the shell.
It's the internal pipes.

1052
01:15:44,871 --> 01:15:45,951
We're okay.

1053
01:15:50,878 --> 01:15:51,992
What the hell is out there?!

1054
01:15:56,675 --> 01:15:57,754
Listen to me.

1055
01:15:58,010 --> 01:15:59,635
Whatever it is,
it's not letting go.

1056
01:15:59,887 --> 01:16:02,841
Pull the green lever marked
"high-voltage defense system. "

1057
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:06,010
He said it would start a fire!
Don't do it!

1058
01:16:06,352 --> 01:16:07,846
You said it would start a fire!

1059
01:16:08,062 --> 01:16:10,387
We're going to die down here.
Pull it.

1060
01:16:10,772 --> 01:16:12,053
Barnes, do you hear her?

1061
01:16:12,316 --> 01:16:14,641
Don't listen to her. She's crazy.
Pull the green lever.

1062
01:16:20,032 --> 01:16:21,313
Pull the lever!

1063
01:16:21,617 --> 01:16:24,190
He's trying to pull something!
Don't do it!

1064
01:16:24,537 --> 01:16:25,533
Do you hear her?!

1065
01:16:25,788 --> 01:16:28,030
Don't listen to her.
Pull the goddamn lever!

1066
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:30,330
Don't do it.
If we start a fire. . .

1067
01:16:31,085 --> 01:16:33,291
. . .it'll eat up all of our oxygen!

1068
01:16:33,546 --> 01:16:35,088
Don't do it!

1069
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:44,554
We've got failures all over the place!
We're taking on water!

1070
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:46,847
It'll set a fire!
There's no way out!

1071
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,933
Shut up!
What am I going to do?!

1072
01:16:49,854 --> 01:16:51,727
You're going to be squid food!
Pull it!

1073
01:16:51,981 --> 01:16:54,389
What am I going to do?
We're falling apart!

1074
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:11,989
We're okay.

1075
01:17:13,294 --> 01:17:15,453
You don't have to be right all the time.

1076
01:17:18,716 --> 01:17:20,376
Anybody got some Advil?

1077
01:17:22,637 --> 01:17:24,297
We got a fire in the comm room.

1078
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:27,555
Get up there. I'll meet you
with gas masks, in case we need them.

1079
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:44,440
Extinguishers?!

1080
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:45,981
There's one there.

1081
01:17:46,202 --> 01:17:47,198
I got it!

1082
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:50,529
-How do you work it?
-Pull the pin.

1083
01:17:55,795 --> 01:17:57,290
Are there any more?

1084
01:17:57,505 --> 01:17:58,537
In the dorm.

1085
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:09,886
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1086
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:13,351
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors secured.

1087
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:17,482
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1088
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,232
Wake up!

1089
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:28,906
What are you doing?

1090
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,747
Harry, wake up!

1091
01:18:31,331 --> 01:18:32,363
Shit!

1092
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:01,943
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1093
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:06,364
Alert, alert.
Emergency doors now activated.

1094
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:07,899
Doors secured.

1095
01:19:09,537 --> 01:19:14,246
It's coming through the ceiling panels.
Try to get it through the cafeteria!

1096
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:17,204
Okay, I'm going up.
Get back!

1097
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:32,934
Don't, Jerry!
Don't.

1098
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:47,399
You okay?

1099
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:48,530
Hang on!

1100
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,785
Get out!

1101
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:13,131
Get out!

1102
01:21:13,954 --> 01:21:15,946
This is Norman, Jerry.
Can you hear me?

1103
01:21:18,667 --> 01:21:21,372
It's Norman.
Is that you, Jerry?

1104
01:21:21,962 --> 01:21:23,954
Who put out the fire?

1105
01:21:25,299 --> 01:21:27,208
Who put the fire out?

1106
01:21:33,765 --> 01:21:36,636
He's dead. Barnes is dead.
He got cut in half by the door.

1107
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:38,803
Beth and I put him
in a body bag.

1108
01:21:41,732 --> 01:21:44,057
I know. Something
happened to Ted, Jerry.

1109
01:21:46,695 --> 01:21:47,893
I can't.

1110
01:21:51,241 --> 01:21:52,949
It's not in my power.

1111
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,912
There was a fire and. . . .

1112
01:22:00,376 --> 01:22:02,001
And I froze.

1113
01:22:04,088 --> 01:22:05,630
I didn't help him.

1114
01:22:07,634 --> 01:22:10,089
I wanted to,
but I didn't help him.

1115
01:22:14,723 --> 01:22:18,093
I knew him since he was 1 7 years old,
and I let him go.

1116
01:22:18,352 --> 01:22:21,057
But I'd like to just deal with this
at a later time.

1117
01:22:27,403 --> 01:22:28,981
You made that, Jerry?

1118
01:22:37,163 --> 01:22:38,574
No, that's all right.

1119
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:42,831
Very important.
Nothing more right now. Please.

1120
01:22:44,712 --> 01:22:45,626
You have to stop.

1121
01:22:45,922 --> 01:22:47,167
Listen to me.

1122
01:22:47,423 --> 01:22:49,547
This is critical.

1123
01:22:55,056 --> 01:22:57,926
Your manifestations injure our entities.

1124
01:22:58,268 --> 01:23:01,601
And pretty soon there'll be
no more entities left to play with. . .

1125
01:23:01,854 --> 01:23:04,392
. . .and you'll be all alone again. . .

1126
01:23:04,648 --> 01:23:06,937
. . .because you can't control yourself.

1127
01:23:07,194 --> 01:23:12,069
Because with all your power, you
don't have the power to stop, do you?

1128
01:23:20,082 --> 01:23:21,659
What name do you want?

1129
01:23:24,419 --> 01:23:25,997
What name do you want?

1130
01:23:53,907 --> 01:23:55,615
Hi, Harry.
How you doing?

1131
01:23:58,328 --> 01:23:59,573
Can you believe what happened?

1132
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:00,778
What?

1133
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,447
You know, the attack on the Habitat.

1134
01:24:05,753 --> 01:24:08,124
You know there was an attack
on this place?

1135
01:24:09,757 --> 01:24:11,583
I must've slept through it.

1136
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:15,087
-You slept through it.
-I was dead tired.

1137
01:24:18,556 --> 01:24:20,217
Smoke didn't bother you?

1138
01:24:21,268 --> 01:24:22,810
All the leaking?

1139
01:24:23,479 --> 01:24:26,729
You ever read this book,
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea ?

1140
01:24:26,982 --> 01:24:30,648
I found it in the john.
Someone's misguided attempt at levity.

1141
01:24:31,236 --> 01:24:33,229
I always loved this book.

1142
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:36,283
Could never get past page 87 though.
Too scary.

1143
01:24:36,617 --> 01:24:39,108
You seem strangely detached,
given our predicament.

1144
01:24:39,411 --> 01:24:41,120
I don't know, Norman.

1145
01:24:41,956 --> 01:24:44,707
With all your running around,
what have you accomplished?

1146
01:24:44,958 --> 01:24:47,117
You knew I was running around?

1147
01:24:49,755 --> 01:24:51,795
Have you seen Beth?

1148
01:24:52,049 --> 01:24:53,922
No. Thought she's
with the others.

1149
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:57,261
What others?
Barnes and Ted are dead, Harry.

1150
01:24:58,347 --> 01:25:02,013
There's nobody left down here
that knows how to run the place.

1151
01:25:02,268 --> 01:25:03,430
Right?

1152
01:25:03,978 --> 01:25:06,385
The fire screwed up the electronics.

1153
01:25:07,398 --> 01:25:08,892
We've used up. . .

1154
01:25:09,275 --> 01:25:11,433
. . .most of our reserve gas.

1155
01:25:13,028 --> 01:25:14,653
You're reading your book.

1156
01:25:19,952 --> 01:25:21,779
Somebody has to go reset the mini-sub.

1157
01:25:22,037 --> 01:25:25,122
If you don't reset it every 1 2 hours,
it'll float to the surface.

1158
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,949
I'll go.

1159
01:25:27,961 --> 01:25:29,834
-I'll go.
-You sure?

1160
01:25:30,838 --> 01:25:32,878
If the storm clears. . .

1161
01:25:33,257 --> 01:25:35,131
. . .it might be our only way out.

1162
01:25:35,384 --> 01:25:37,293
Can I talk to you for a second?

1163
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:41,344
I don't want Harry anywhere near
that mini-sub.

1164
01:25:41,599 --> 01:25:42,797
Think he'll leave without us?

1165
01:25:43,059 --> 01:25:46,594
I think he already left without us.
Harry's in a whole other place.

1166
01:25:46,854 --> 01:25:51,398
He slept through the attack.
You don't find that a little strange?

1167
01:25:52,902 --> 01:25:54,941
I guess it's just you and me, babe.

1168
01:25:56,489 --> 01:25:57,734
You and me?

1169
01:25:59,367 --> 01:26:01,444
I'll keep my eye on you
from the control room.

1170
01:26:29,522 --> 01:26:30,851
Reset.

1171
01:26:31,608 --> 01:26:33,481
Reset, where are you?

1172
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:35,351
There you are.

1173
01:26:56,007 --> 01:26:58,499
Are there supposed to be bubbles. . .

1174
01:26:58,802 --> 01:27:00,380
. . .coming out of. . .

1175
01:27:01,596 --> 01:27:02,972
. . .out of here too?

1176
01:27:06,935 --> 01:27:09,806
I think I have bubbles coming out
of my hose or something.

1177
01:27:13,442 --> 01:27:17,061
Can you tell me what to do?
It's fogging me all up here.

1178
01:27:19,322 --> 01:27:21,115
There's something wrong here!

1179
01:27:21,325 --> 01:27:24,279
I got to get out of here!
Tell me what to do! What do I push?

1180
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:25,901
Where the hell are you?

1181
01:27:26,205 --> 01:27:27,284
Help me.

1182
01:27:32,169 --> 01:27:34,839
I don 't think I'll ever get back!

1183
01:27:40,969 --> 01:27:42,250
Tell me what to do!

1184
01:27:44,098 --> 01:27:45,426
I can't breathe!

1185
01:27:45,641 --> 01:27:47,599
Watch out for that rock.

1186
01:27:48,102 --> 01:27:51,387
It's me, Harry.
Come around the rock.

1187
01:27:51,648 --> 01:27:53,853
Go to the right of the stanchion.

1188
01:27:54,192 --> 01:27:56,065
Tell me what to do.
I'm hurting.

1189
01:27:56,569 --> 01:27:58,396
Come around which way?

1190
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:00,727
I can't breathe!

1191
01:28:01,115 --> 01:28:02,609
Yes, you can breathe.

1192
01:28:02,867 --> 01:28:06,283
It's just a faulty valve.
It won't kill you. You got plenty of gas.

1193
01:28:06,537 --> 01:28:07,948
I can 't tell which way I'm going!

1194
01:28:08,205 --> 01:28:10,661
See the air lock?
Right in front of you.

1195
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I can 't bear the feeling in my ears!
And I can't breathe.

1196
01:28:40,864 --> 01:28:42,571
-Where is she?
-Slow your breathing.

1197
01:28:42,824 --> 01:28:46,158
-You'll hyperventilate.
-She said she'd keep an eye out for me.

1198
01:28:46,494 --> 01:28:49,579
I looked all over the Habitat for her.
I thought she was with you.

1199
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:53,661
Where is she?

1200
01:28:54,294 --> 01:28:55,325
Where is she?!

1201
01:29:05,305 --> 01:29:07,298
Did she tell you she was going out?

1202
01:29:10,394 --> 01:29:11,804
I can 't hear you.

1203
01:29:12,062 --> 01:29:13,604
If she can't hear,
why'd she answer?

1204
01:29:13,855 --> 01:29:14,970
What are you doing?

1205
01:29:15,232 --> 01:29:17,687
I went looking for food.
We're out of food.

1206
01:29:18,443 --> 01:29:21,729
I was just up there. Stuff all over,
but there's plenty of food.

1207
01:29:21,988 --> 01:29:25,404
You went to look for food in the
spacecraft. That seems a little odd.

1208
01:29:25,701 --> 01:29:27,278
No. What seems odd about it?

1209
01:29:27,953 --> 01:29:31,119
Even if there was food,
wouldn't it be at least 300 years old?

1210
01:29:31,456 --> 01:29:33,994
I was hoping for a cryogenic freezer,
you know?

1211
01:29:34,334 --> 01:29:36,208
Maybe a bottle of Bordeaux.

1212
01:29:36,796 --> 01:29:39,251
She's lying.
She's lying about everything.

1213
01:29:39,881 --> 01:29:41,709
Is Harry up there with you?

1214
01:29:46,388 --> 01:29:49,804
Why don't we talk when you get back.
Meet me in the galley.

1215
01:29:50,058 --> 01:29:53,474
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
There's still coffee, isn't there?

1216
01:29:53,813 --> 01:29:57,680
Very funny. I'll take mine black,
like my mood.

1217
01:29:57,942 --> 01:29:59,649
All right. See you soon.

1218
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:05,650
We got 2 ingredients here:
Beth and this underwater environment.

1219
01:30:05,908 --> 01:30:09,158
Put them together,
you got one big-ass bomb.

1220
01:30:18,879 --> 01:30:20,587
How did it go in the mini-sub?

1221
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:23,087
It was a little disconcerting
out there, actually.

1222
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:27,049
Weren't you supposed to be watching out
for me from the control room?

1223
01:30:27,262 --> 01:30:28,673
Yeah, but. . .

1224
01:30:28,931 --> 01:30:33,011
. . .Harry said he'd take over for me.
You sat down at the monitors.

1225
01:30:35,646 --> 01:30:36,677
What happened?

1226
01:30:37,857 --> 01:30:39,137
I was in trouble.

1227
01:30:39,399 --> 01:30:40,396
Where were you?

1228
01:30:43,404 --> 01:30:45,729
-What's going on?
-"What's going on?"

1229
01:30:46,157 --> 01:30:49,277
Going out to look for 300-year-old food
in that spaceship. . .

1230
01:30:49,535 --> 01:30:52,536
. . .when there's plenty of food here
isn't exactly normal.

1231
01:30:52,872 --> 01:30:54,117
"Plenty of food"?

1232
01:30:54,373 --> 01:30:56,164
There isn't any. . . .

1233
01:31:02,506 --> 01:31:04,131
A veritable horn of plenty.

1234
01:31:16,729 --> 01:31:17,725
He must have hidden it.

1235
01:31:17,938 --> 01:31:19,896
You think I hid all that food?

1236
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:21,983
I don't know what's going on.

1237
01:31:25,154 --> 01:31:26,530
I was standing right here.

1238
01:31:27,115 --> 01:31:29,274
And there was no food
in the cupboards.

1239
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:34,196
And there was no food
in the fridge.

1240
01:31:34,456 --> 01:31:35,404
Why?

1241
01:31:35,665 --> 01:31:38,335
Why would Harry do that?
Why would he set you up?

1242
01:31:38,668 --> 01:31:40,292
I don't know.

1243
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:43,161
You don't know?

1244
01:31:43,423 --> 01:31:44,752
I'm telling you. . .

1245
01:31:45,008 --> 01:31:46,834
. . .I was standing here. . .

1246
01:31:47,177 --> 01:31:49,004
. . .and this food was not here!

1247
01:31:49,303 --> 01:31:52,969
Calling Dr. Halperin. Dr. Beth
Halperin. Please return to reality.

1248
01:31:53,349 --> 01:31:54,725
Shut up.

1249
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:56,851
You can see what he's doing to me.

1250
01:31:57,103 --> 01:31:58,977
You said you'd watch me.
You didn't.

1251
01:31:59,231 --> 01:32:01,022
You think Harry
said something he didn't. . .

1252
01:32:01,274 --> 01:32:02,982
. . .that cupboards are empty
when they're full.

1253
01:32:03,235 --> 01:32:06,935
Clinically, we would call that
evidence of a psychotic break.

1254
01:32:07,322 --> 01:32:08,864
I am not crazy, Norman!

1255
01:32:09,783 --> 01:32:11,775
You going to write me a prescription?

1256
01:32:12,035 --> 01:32:16,199
And just get rid of me again?
It's not that convenient down here!

1257
01:32:16,456 --> 01:32:17,702
I am not psychotic!

1258
01:32:17,999 --> 01:32:19,328
How about a mini-psychotic break?

1259
01:32:19,543 --> 01:32:20,657
That's not fair.

1260
01:32:20,878 --> 01:32:21,708
What?!

1261
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:26,214
I'm down there. I can't breathe.
I'm hyperventilating. The man saved me.

1262
01:32:26,717 --> 01:32:27,796
Wait a minute!

1263
01:32:28,052 --> 01:32:30,507
You want me to believe
that he set you up! Why?

1264
01:32:30,887 --> 01:32:32,714
This isn't Alice ln Wonderland !

1265
01:32:32,932 --> 01:32:34,840
Remember, "just you and me, babe"?

1266
01:32:35,767 --> 01:32:38,175
Is it unrealistic to think
that at this point. . .

1267
01:32:38,437 --> 01:32:41,473
. . .you are a danger to yourself,
to all of us. . .

1268
01:32:41,857 --> 01:32:46,151
. . .because of your anger toward me,
which happened 1 0 or 1 5 years ago. . .

1269
01:32:46,403 --> 01:32:48,112
. . .which is so distorted
in your head!

1270
01:32:48,906 --> 01:32:49,937
I was out there.

1271
01:32:50,157 --> 01:32:51,900
You almost got me killed!

1272
01:32:52,201 --> 01:32:55,866
The man tried to save my life!
You now want me to disbelieve Harry?!

1273
01:32:56,122 --> 01:32:59,325
Yes, I want you to disbelieve Harry!
I want you. . .

1274
01:32:59,583 --> 01:33:02,252
. . .to look at me
and believe for one time.

1275
01:33:04,671 --> 01:33:06,499
Look at me.
Am I telling you the truth?

1276
01:33:06,716 --> 01:33:07,878
You weren't there.

1277
01:33:09,426 --> 01:33:13,424
You want to believe Harry,
then that's fine.

1278
01:33:13,931 --> 01:33:17,430
Because he's done everything but part
the sea for you since we've been here.

1279
01:33:19,228 --> 01:33:21,020
But I'm telling you. . .

1280
01:33:21,397 --> 01:33:22,939
. . .that he is not. . .

1281
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:25,313
. . .telling you the truth.

1282
01:33:25,692 --> 01:33:26,891
This is not about Harry.

1283
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:29,269
Is it?

1284
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:32,234
Who's this about?

1285
01:33:34,451 --> 01:33:37,369
He didn't tell you what's
inside the Sphere, did he?

1286
01:33:38,539 --> 01:33:42,158
You didn't tell him
what's inside the Sphere.

1287
01:33:43,461 --> 01:33:45,619
And how would you know that?

1288
01:33:51,511 --> 01:33:52,590
Did you go inside?

1289
01:33:56,974 --> 01:33:59,300
Answer me.
Did you go inside the Sphere?

1290
01:34:03,857 --> 01:34:05,683
Why won't you answer me?

1291
01:34:09,487 --> 01:34:10,566
It's a question.

1292
01:34:10,822 --> 01:34:12,696
You don't want to talk to me.

1293
01:34:12,949 --> 01:34:14,147
Remember?

1294
01:34:15,534 --> 01:34:16,993
Answer a question.

1295
01:34:21,999 --> 01:34:23,458
What do you think?

1296
01:34:25,128 --> 01:34:27,168
You think she went in the Sphere?

1297
01:34:39,017 --> 01:34:40,179
Here.

1298
01:34:40,561 --> 01:34:42,268
You dropped your book.

1299
01:36:16,865 --> 01:36:18,490
What isn't Harry telling me?

1300
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:21,573
I know you're there.
You're always there.

1301
01:36:23,456 --> 01:36:25,413
What's inside the Sphere?

1302
01:36:26,793 --> 01:36:29,200
Harry is reading this book. . .

1303
01:36:29,587 --> 01:36:31,876
... Twenty Thousand Leagues
Under the Sea.

1304
01:36:32,548 --> 01:36:35,253
What makes me nervous
is that after page. . .

1305
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:37,170
. . .87. . .

1306
01:36:41,975 --> 01:36:43,967
. . .it's all blank pages.

1307
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:49,394
Why?

1308
01:36:51,651 --> 01:36:53,857
Why did he go into the Sphere. . .

1309
01:36:57,324 --> 01:36:59,197
. . .and come out like this?
Why?

1310
01:36:59,576 --> 01:37:01,034
Why?
Why, Jerry?

1311
01:37:01,328 --> 01:37:03,367
Why is this book half a book, Jerry?

1312
01:37:04,373 --> 01:37:05,570
Why? Why?

1313
01:37:05,915 --> 01:37:07,493
What's going on?

1314
01:37:13,006 --> 01:37:15,579
He's got G equals one.

1315
01:37:16,259 --> 01:37:17,670
That's right.

1316
01:37:18,428 --> 01:37:21,382
He's got B equals two.

1317
01:37:23,934 --> 01:37:25,131
He's got. . .

1318
01:37:25,352 --> 01:37:27,391
. . .H equals three.

1319
01:37:28,396 --> 01:37:29,677
That's not right.

1320
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:32,229
Harry's got the code wrong.

1321
01:37:32,484 --> 01:37:34,772
H doesn't equal three.

1322
01:38:55,609 --> 01:38:58,978
Harry not only makes it real
for himself, Beth.

1323
01:38:59,238 --> 01:39:01,694
He makes it real for you.
He makes it real for me.

1324
01:39:01,949 --> 01:39:04,322
He has made it real for everybody.

1325
01:39:04,618 --> 01:39:08,830
It's really frightening because you
don't know whether it's really real. . .

1326
01:39:09,082 --> 01:39:13,624
. . .or whether he's made it real
for us to believe it's real.

1327
01:39:14,712 --> 01:39:16,704
And it's because of the Sphere.

1328
01:39:20,050 --> 01:39:22,008
Our Harry is Jerry?

1329
01:39:22,261 --> 01:39:25,014
Come on, I'm just as tired
as you are.

1330
01:39:25,639 --> 01:39:27,549
I know you can get this.
Okay?

1331
01:39:29,643 --> 01:39:34,639
Harry said he couldn't get past page 87
because he said it was too scary.

1332
01:39:35,024 --> 01:39:37,101
There's nothing on the pages.
Where's the rest?

1333
01:39:37,527 --> 01:39:39,187
Read what's on page 87.

1334
01:39:40,655 --> 01:39:42,814
"According to calculations
of some naturalists. . .

1335
01:39:43,074 --> 01:39:47,403
. . .one of these animals, only 6 feet
long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.

1336
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,197
That would make a formidable monster. "

1337
01:39:50,957 --> 01:39:52,535
What does Harry hate?

1338
01:39:53,085 --> 01:39:54,495
Squid.

1339
01:39:54,878 --> 01:39:56,917
And when he read that,
it scared him.

1340
01:39:57,755 --> 01:39:59,166
Getting the picture?

1341
01:39:59,591 --> 01:40:01,299
Remember all those. . .

1342
01:40:01,551 --> 01:40:03,294
. . .jellyfish that attacked?

1343
01:40:03,554 --> 01:40:05,345
What was Harry doing then?

1344
01:40:05,847 --> 01:40:06,796
Sleeping.

1345
01:40:07,015 --> 01:40:08,509
He was dreaming.

1346
01:40:09,977 --> 01:40:12,514
And this is the really wild part:

1347
01:40:13,188 --> 01:40:14,137
What he dreamed. . . .

1348
01:40:14,397 --> 01:40:15,311
Happened?

1349
01:40:15,607 --> 01:40:17,149
It happened.

1350
01:40:17,942 --> 01:40:20,231
You're telling me that. . .

1351
01:40:20,487 --> 01:40:24,864
. . .because Harry went inside the Sphere,
he now has the power to manifest. . .

1352
01:40:25,116 --> 01:40:27,868
. . .his dreams, his fantasies. . . .

1353
01:40:28,203 --> 01:40:30,029
Manifest.
He manifested it.

1354
01:40:30,289 --> 01:40:31,533
He made it happen.

1355
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:33,200
We better not piss him off.

1356
01:40:33,417 --> 01:40:36,086
It's not that different
from a child, right?

1357
01:40:36,419 --> 01:40:40,002
A child imagines that
what it's imagining happens.

1358
01:40:40,257 --> 01:40:41,372
But it doesn't.

1359
01:40:41,633 --> 01:40:43,377
But with Harry, it does.

1360
01:40:43,635 --> 01:40:47,087
In fact, it's so real, it's not only
real to Harry, it's real to all of us.

1361
01:40:47,431 --> 01:40:50,385
And what I can't understand is that
ever since he went in the Sphere. . .

1362
01:40:50,684 --> 01:40:52,226
. . .the Sphere has a power. . .

1363
01:40:52,477 --> 01:40:56,143
. . .that projects every subconscious
thought Harry has onto the computer.

1364
01:40:56,481 --> 01:40:58,889
It prints it out
and we interact with it.

1365
01:40:59,151 --> 01:41:02,318
We thought it was Jerry.
It's not Jerry. It's Harry.

1366
01:41:02,654 --> 01:41:03,853
Harry's Jerry.

1367
01:41:04,114 --> 01:41:05,657
Does Harry know this?

1368
01:41:05,908 --> 01:41:08,577
But you went in the Sphere
and nothing happened.

1369
01:41:08,911 --> 01:41:11,034
Obviously, I didn't go in the Sphere.

1370
01:41:11,288 --> 01:41:15,582
You never went inside the Sphere?
You didn't go in there?

1371
01:41:16,794 --> 01:41:19,166
I was so angry at you.

1372
01:41:20,422 --> 01:41:22,499
I wanted you to be scared.

1373
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:24,961
Maybe you had a right to be.

1374
01:41:25,595 --> 01:41:26,922
Thanks.

1375
01:41:28,264 --> 01:41:29,924
You sure you didn't go in there?

1376
01:41:32,559 --> 01:41:35,561
I don't know about you,
but I don't feel like dying down here.

1377
01:41:35,939 --> 01:41:38,226
What we're going to do
is find something to put Harry under.

1378
01:41:38,483 --> 01:41:41,603
We can put him in some
kind of deep unconscious sleep.

1379
01:41:41,861 --> 01:41:43,272
Dreamless sleep, I hope.

1380
01:41:43,529 --> 01:41:45,356
A dreamless sleep, yes.

1381
01:41:45,615 --> 01:41:47,108
How do we do that?

1382
01:41:47,366 --> 01:41:49,110
I got a bunch of drugs up there.

1383
01:41:49,994 --> 01:41:51,108
Fancy that.

1384
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:52,913
-"Diphenylpyraline. "
-Burns.

1385
01:41:53,164 --> 01:41:55,536
-"Ephedrine hydrochloride. "
-Motion sickness.

1386
01:41:55,791 --> 01:41:57,369
"Valdomet"?

1387
01:41:57,627 --> 01:42:00,165
-Ulcers. You might want to keep that.
-"Sintag. "

1388
01:42:00,421 --> 01:42:03,837
Sintag is a synthetic opiate.
It's a painkiller.

1389
01:42:04,092 --> 01:42:05,550
I might want to keep that.

1390
01:42:05,802 --> 01:42:08,257
-What about "parasolutrine"?
-Really?

1391
01:42:08,513 --> 01:42:11,348
I got paracin trichloride.
That's an anesthetic.

1392
01:42:11,599 --> 01:42:12,761
Do you combine it?

1393
01:42:13,017 --> 01:42:15,769
You give about 20 cc's of this one,
6 of this one.

1394
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:16,934
You're in business.

1395
01:42:17,188 --> 01:42:18,766
Here's some more paracin trichloride.

1396
01:42:19,023 --> 01:42:21,894
Good. We'll knock him out
for about 3 to 6 hours.

1397
01:42:34,497 --> 01:42:36,371
I'm going to hold him.

1398
01:42:45,217 --> 01:42:46,165
What's going on?

1399
01:42:46,426 --> 01:42:47,671
Go back to sleep.

1400
01:42:53,183 --> 01:42:56,018
I didn't know
it would be that fast-acting.

1401
01:42:57,354 --> 01:42:58,896
We didn't kill him, did we?

1402
01:42:59,147 --> 01:43:00,689
I don't think so.

1403
01:43:03,527 --> 01:43:04,606
Okay.

1404
01:43:12,869 --> 01:43:14,827
Come on, come on.

1405
01:43:20,293 --> 01:43:21,373
Here we go.

1406
01:43:26,091 --> 01:43:27,170
It's a code.

1407
01:43:32,889 --> 01:43:34,763
How the hell are we supposed--

1408
01:43:35,017 --> 01:43:36,559
It's decoding itself.

1409
01:43:38,562 --> 01:43:42,061
"Weather normal.
Surface support vessels return. "

1410
01:43:42,316 --> 01:43:45,020
6 hours and counting,
we're out of here.

1411
01:43:46,570 --> 01:43:47,899
It's over.

1412
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:55,570
If you trust it.

1413
01:43:56,914 --> 01:43:59,239
You know me,
I believe everything.

1414
01:45:20,081 --> 01:45:21,160
Get out!

1415
01:45:21,624 --> 01:45:22,953
Get off!

1416
01:45:48,109 --> 01:45:49,817
They're Belcher sea snakes, Norman.

1417
01:45:50,070 --> 01:45:51,778
The most poisonous snakes in the world.

1418
01:45:52,656 --> 01:45:55,147
But they're nocturnal.
They're only dangerous at night.

1419
01:46:07,045 --> 01:46:09,583
Norman, can you meet me
at the lab, please?

1420
01:46:09,839 --> 01:46:12,295
I have something
I need to show you.

1421
01:46:33,989 --> 01:46:35,234
What are you doing?
I'm here.

1422
01:46:37,368 --> 01:46:38,399
What are you doing?

1423
01:46:47,336 --> 01:46:48,795
Why are you locking me in?

1424
01:47:00,891 --> 01:47:02,718
You manifested the snakes.

1425
01:47:03,811 --> 01:47:05,353
Norman, up here.

1426
01:47:05,688 --> 01:47:08,891
You're the only one
who could be manifesting these snakes.

1427
01:47:09,233 --> 01:47:13,017
Turn around.
Turn around and look on the table.

1428
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:19,192
-See the hypodermic needle?
-Yeah.

1429
01:47:19,493 --> 01:47:21,486
I want you to inject yourself.

1430
01:47:23,206 --> 01:47:24,403
It's the same thing. . .

1431
01:47:24,623 --> 01:47:26,117
. . .that we used to inject Harry.

1432
01:47:26,334 --> 01:47:30,711
We gave Harry this stuff because
he was manifesting and we wanted to--

1433
01:47:31,089 --> 01:47:33,460
You're manifesting your fears. . .

1434
01:47:33,966 --> 01:47:35,129
. . .the jellyfish. . .

1435
01:47:35,385 --> 01:47:36,927
. . .now the snakes.

1436
01:47:37,178 --> 01:47:39,550
The squid thing was Harry,
but he's asleep.

1437
01:47:39,931 --> 01:47:44,308
He's in a dreamless sleep. It couldn't
be him. You are the only one left.

1438
01:47:44,727 --> 01:47:48,594
What would the snakes have to do
with me? I didn't go in the Sphere.

1439
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,721
See the jars?

1440
01:47:50,983 --> 01:47:55,231
I put the snakes in there and they
disappeared in front of my eyes.

1441
01:47:55,571 --> 01:47:57,814
Who's manifesting them, Norman?

1442
01:47:58,324 --> 01:47:59,274
You are.

1443
01:47:59,576 --> 01:48:01,153
I don 't have anything
to do with snakes.

1444
01:48:01,369 --> 01:48:05,367
If you don't use the hypodermic needle,
I'm going to have to defend myself.

1445
01:48:05,749 --> 01:48:07,540
I'd remember
if I went in the Sphere!

1446
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:10,668
Don't make me do this.
I don't want to do this.

1447
01:48:10,962 --> 01:48:12,160
I didn 't manifest anything.

1448
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:15,630
I didn 't manifest the squid.
I didn 't manifest the....

1449
01:48:15,883 --> 01:48:17,543
I shouldn 't be
talking to you like this.

1450
01:48:19,596 --> 01:48:22,347
Why are you taking the gas out
of the room? That's my air.

1451
01:48:33,526 --> 01:48:35,436
What's with this water?!

1452
01:48:35,779 --> 01:48:39,230
Think it through. Whose childhood fears
were the jellyfish?

1453
01:48:39,574 --> 01:48:41,033
-Jellyfish?
-Remember, Norman?

1454
01:48:41,243 --> 01:48:43,318
I'm not the only one
who's afraid of jellyfish.

1455
01:48:43,537 --> 01:48:45,161
This wasn't exactly a jellyfish.

1456
01:48:45,372 --> 01:48:46,866
Jellyfish like this are unheard of.

1457
01:48:47,082 --> 01:48:48,457
Anybody can be. . .

1458
01:48:49,709 --> 01:48:52,497
. . .afraid of jellyfish.
A lot of people are afraid of them.

1459
01:48:53,004 --> 01:48:56,587
Isn't it possible
that you went inside the Sphere. . .

1460
01:48:57,301 --> 01:48:59,092
. . .and you just don't remember?

1461
01:48:59,302 --> 01:49:02,387
I didn't go inside the Sphere!
You would've seen it on the video!

1462
01:49:03,557 --> 01:49:05,182
I didn't go inside the Sphere.

1463
01:49:05,434 --> 01:49:06,264
Yes, you did.

1464
01:49:06,476 --> 01:49:07,508
Is he alive?

1465
01:49:07,728 --> 01:49:08,807
You went inside the Sphere...

1466
01:49:09,104 --> 01:49:11,975
...and you just don 't remember.
That's the problem.

1467
01:49:16,278 --> 01:49:18,354
It's not me!
I'm not going to use it!

1468
01:49:18,697 --> 01:49:21,104
Inject yourself
with the hypodermic needle.

1469
01:49:27,665 --> 01:49:29,207
It's your snakes.
See?

1470
01:49:29,416 --> 01:49:31,124
It's all a fear.
It's just a fear.

1471
01:49:31,585 --> 01:49:34,621
You can make it go away.
Just use the hypodermic needle.

1472
01:49:34,964 --> 01:49:38,048
And the ships will come
and we'll get out of here.

1473
01:49:39,593 --> 01:49:42,215
What are you doing?!
You're going to kill me!

1474
01:49:46,475 --> 01:49:47,589
You can stop it.

1475
01:49:49,603 --> 01:49:51,347
Try to pull yourself together.

1476
01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:54,729
Your fears are going to kill
all of us.

1477
01:50:09,081 --> 01:50:10,991
Please, don't open the hatch.

1478
01:50:11,334 --> 01:50:13,741
You'll freeze to death in the water.

1479
01:50:18,173 --> 01:50:20,961
You'll kill yourself!
Don't open the hatch!

1480
01:50:51,208 --> 01:50:52,999
I know enough
not to get killed down here.

1481
01:50:53,209 --> 01:50:55,416
Are you the most qualified
in your field?

1482
01:50:55,628 --> 01:50:58,000
What exactly are your qualifications?
Why are you here?

1483
01:50:58,256 --> 01:51:00,249
Why are you here?
Why are you here?

1484
01:51:03,094 --> 01:51:04,921
Are you the most qualified?

1485
01:51:05,221 --> 01:51:07,926
You almost got me killed.

1486
01:51:09,475 --> 01:51:10,756
You're a danger to all of us.

1487
01:51:12,187 --> 01:51:13,847
Come back to reality.

1488
01:53:38,668 --> 01:53:40,210
What are you doing?

1489
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:09,651
Are you real?

1490
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:18,367
As real as the water
that almost drowned me.

1491
01:54:21,795 --> 01:54:23,538
You tried to kill me.

1492
01:54:27,884 --> 01:54:29,378
What are you doing there?

1493
01:54:33,766 --> 01:54:36,435
Beth, you went into the Sphere.

1494
01:54:40,146 --> 01:54:41,309
Didn't you?

1495
01:55:05,089 --> 01:55:06,168
Answer me.

1496
01:55:06,423 --> 01:55:09,709
I don't know what to think.
I feel like I can't breathe.

1497
01:55:10,845 --> 01:55:12,884
I'm losing it, you know?

1498
01:55:13,722 --> 01:55:16,676
I'm trying to keep it together, but. . . .

1499
01:55:17,935 --> 01:55:19,310
What's going on?

1500
01:55:19,519 --> 01:55:21,062
Why'd you put me out?

1501
01:55:22,231 --> 01:55:24,223
What are you guys up to?

1502
01:55:24,775 --> 01:55:26,435
You went in the Sphere, Harry.

1503
01:55:26,903 --> 01:55:28,147
So did Beth.

1504
01:55:28,613 --> 01:55:29,810
So did l.

1505
01:55:30,739 --> 01:55:31,521
I think.

1506
01:55:32,116 --> 01:55:33,859
And if so, what?

1507
01:55:34,410 --> 01:55:36,486
Everything that we feel or think. . .

1508
01:55:36,787 --> 01:55:37,736
. . .just. . .

1509
01:55:37,996 --> 01:55:39,112
. . .happens.

1510
01:55:39,373 --> 01:55:41,532
That's what happened
to the astronauts.

1511
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:44,917
The astronaut in the chair,
what did you say about his head?

1512
01:55:45,463 --> 01:55:46,625
He had. . .

1513
01:55:47,131 --> 01:55:49,836
. . .blunt force trauma.
He got hit in the head.

1514
01:55:50,218 --> 01:55:52,009
They went into the Sphere one by one. . .

1515
01:55:52,261 --> 01:55:55,381
. . .became afraid of each other,
till they killed each other off.

1516
01:55:55,639 --> 01:55:57,881
And we're doing the same thing.

1517
01:55:58,977 --> 01:56:00,601
I don't want to kill you.

1518
01:56:04,023 --> 01:56:05,766
Your attention, please.

1519
01:56:05,941 --> 01:56:09,310
All construction personnel
must exit the blast area...

1520
01:56:09,654 --> 01:56:10,603
...immediately.

1521
01:56:10,863 --> 01:56:13,734
Panther explosives
are now activated.

1522
01:56:13,991 --> 01:56:16,564
Mark 13 minutes and counting.

1523
01:56:17,328 --> 01:56:19,120
Want to tell me who that voice is?

1524
01:56:19,956 --> 01:56:23,824
They had explosives down here
to blow up the coral.

1525
01:56:24,085 --> 01:56:28,961
So when I went out before, I set up a
defense perimeter around the spaceship.

1526
01:56:29,298 --> 01:56:30,757
Something must have triggered it.

1527
01:56:32,010 --> 01:56:33,883
Something from inside the Sphere.

1528
01:56:34,095 --> 01:56:38,009
-Nothing in the Sphere. You know that.
-Then what?

1529
01:56:38,558 --> 01:56:39,305
I don't know.

1530
01:56:41,269 --> 01:56:42,264
Then who?

1531
01:56:46,858 --> 01:56:48,139
It's me.

1532
01:56:49,194 --> 01:56:50,653
Oh, God.

1533
01:56:51,238 --> 01:56:54,108
I was just thinking
about the explosives.

1534
01:56:54,366 --> 01:56:57,700
It just flashed inside my mind.
It must've triggered them.

1535
01:57:03,917 --> 01:57:05,910
I was thinking about wanting to die.

1536
01:57:07,379 --> 01:57:09,585
You put explosives near the spacecraft?

1537
01:57:10,507 --> 01:57:11,917
Yeah, I did.

1538
01:57:13,385 --> 01:57:15,378
But they're about 1 00 yards away.

1539
01:57:16,055 --> 01:57:18,972
There's a lot of liquid hydrogen
left on that spacecraft.

1540
01:57:19,266 --> 01:57:21,507
If it explodes,
it'll disintegrate everything.

1541
01:57:24,521 --> 01:57:26,430
Mini-sub, now!
Let's go!

1542
01:57:30,569 --> 01:57:32,692
I hope there's a ship up there.

1543
01:57:35,157 --> 01:57:36,355
Your attention, please.

1544
01:57:36,575 --> 01:57:41,367
All construction personnel must exit
the blast area immediately.

1545
01:57:41,705 --> 01:57:44,825
Panther explosives
are now activated.

1546
01:57:45,209 --> 01:57:47,331
Mark 10 minutes and counting.

1547
01:57:59,431 --> 01:58:00,760
Let's go! Let's go!

1548
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:02,631
Come on, come on!

1549
01:58:09,608 --> 01:58:10,984
Come on, move!

1550
01:58:11,318 --> 01:58:12,315
Keep moving.

1551
01:58:13,112 --> 01:58:14,903
We're not going to make it!

1552
01:58:18,951 --> 01:58:21,240
There's not enough time.

1553
01:58:21,495 --> 01:58:22,740
Just keep moving.

1554
01:58:23,039 --> 01:58:26,242
We're not out of time. We're
not going to die here. Keep moving.

1555
01:58:40,139 --> 01:58:41,763
Let's go, Norman.

1556
01:58:42,266 --> 01:58:44,342
It's not like I drive subs, okay?

1557
01:58:44,644 --> 01:58:45,841
You're driving one now.

1558
01:58:49,857 --> 01:58:51,186
Oh, my God!

1559
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:53,139
What's going on?

1560
01:58:53,445 --> 01:58:54,393
I don't know.

1561
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:56,279
Why are we inside the spaceship?

1562
01:58:56,573 --> 01:58:57,568
I don't know.

1563
01:58:58,950 --> 01:58:59,614
Let's go!

1564
01:59:00,201 --> 01:59:03,451
Now alert, alert.
5 minutes and counting.

1565
01:59:05,289 --> 01:59:07,995
We're not moving.
Anybody hit the button?

1566
01:59:09,544 --> 01:59:10,326
What the hell?

1567
01:59:12,171 --> 01:59:14,745
Wait a minute,
this was an elevator before, right?

1568
01:59:15,008 --> 01:59:17,166
Which one of us is doing this?

1569
01:59:17,427 --> 01:59:18,293
Oh, God.

1570
01:59:18,803 --> 01:59:21,376
Alert, alert.
Panther explosives armed.

1571
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:23,513
Wait, wait.
We were here already!

1572
01:59:25,644 --> 01:59:27,683
How much time we got?!
Come on!

1573
01:59:28,396 --> 01:59:29,261
It's a dead end.

1574
01:59:29,564 --> 01:59:30,974
Where are we?

1575
01:59:31,358 --> 01:59:32,306
An illusion.

1576
01:59:32,567 --> 01:59:34,144
Doesn't look like it.

1577
01:59:34,403 --> 01:59:37,523
Beth, which way?
Harry, where do we go?

1578
01:59:37,864 --> 01:59:39,655
Where?
Where's where, Norman?

1579
01:59:39,908 --> 01:59:41,568
Around that corner?

1580
01:59:41,910 --> 01:59:43,108
And what's there?

1581
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:46,869
Just another blind alley
in the maze of our minds. Illusion.

1582
01:59:47,207 --> 01:59:48,156
Maybe he's right.

1583
01:59:48,416 --> 01:59:50,290
We believe that,
we're dead.

1584
01:59:50,627 --> 01:59:52,370
Just go on. Leave me.

1585
01:59:52,712 --> 01:59:57,125
You're not going to die down here.
I'm not going to let you die. Come on.

1586
01:59:58,843 --> 02:00:00,551
I'm not going to die.

1587
02:00:03,390 --> 02:00:05,050
You have to push the button.

1588
02:00:05,392 --> 02:00:06,507
I can't see a button.

1589
02:00:06,768 --> 02:00:07,883
I can't see the button.

1590
02:00:08,145 --> 02:00:09,343
I can't see the button.

1591
02:00:09,604 --> 02:00:11,015
It's no use.

1592
02:00:11,398 --> 02:00:12,857
We die down here.

1593
02:00:14,026 --> 02:00:16,184
We're running out of time.
They all look the same.

1594
02:00:17,655 --> 02:00:19,481
I don't know where we are
or what we're stuck in.

1595
02:00:19,740 --> 02:00:22,860
Where we are is stuck in the illusion
that we can change the future.

1596
02:00:23,159 --> 02:00:24,405
It's a dead end.

1597
02:00:24,786 --> 02:00:27,028
Just like I said all along:

1598
02:00:27,581 --> 02:00:28,577
We die down here.

1599
02:00:28,832 --> 02:00:30,161
Maybe he's right.

1600
02:00:30,375 --> 02:00:31,656
Maybe he's right.

1601
02:00:31,918 --> 02:00:33,247
I'm not going to die.

1602
02:00:33,503 --> 02:00:34,535
Beth's not going to die.

1603
02:00:34,755 --> 02:00:36,249
And you're not going to die.

1604
02:00:36,465 --> 02:00:38,043
Look, just leave me.

1605
02:00:38,425 --> 02:00:42,423
We're not in the spacecraft!
We're in the mini-sub! This isn't real!

1606
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:44,802
This is your manifestation!
Let it go!

1607
02:00:45,016 --> 02:00:45,679
It's a dead end.

1608
02:00:45,891 --> 02:00:47,434
We're not going to die here.

1609
02:00:47,685 --> 02:00:48,550
It's not our time.

1610
02:01:06,704 --> 02:01:08,114
Thank God, we're out of here.

1611
02:01:08,331 --> 02:01:09,824
Don't start celebrating yet.

1612
02:01:10,041 --> 02:01:10,621
Why not?

1613
02:01:10,833 --> 02:01:12,577
I don't think
we're going fast enough.

1614
02:01:12,835 --> 02:01:13,784
For what?

1615
02:01:14,045 --> 02:01:17,045
An underwater blast creates a suction.
It'll suck us into it.

1616
02:01:17,423 --> 02:01:19,462
That is, if the shock wave
doesn't kill us first.

1617
02:01:20,593 --> 02:01:23,962
Alert, alert.
Mark 20 seconds and counting.

1618
02:01:24,263 --> 02:01:26,505
Panther explosives are now activated.

1619
02:01:32,647 --> 02:01:34,271
640 feet.

1620
02:01:34,523 --> 02:01:35,223
630.

1621
02:01:35,983 --> 02:01:37,229
620.

1622
02:01:44,325 --> 02:01:46,448
61 0. You a religious man, Norman?

1623
02:01:46,702 --> 02:01:48,991
Atheist. But I'm flexible.

1624
02:02:18,943 --> 02:02:20,817
Pull up, Norman!
Pull up!

1625
02:02:24,908 --> 02:02:26,152
Come on, pull up!

1626
02:02:55,230 --> 02:02:56,724
This is Escort 7.

1627
02:02:56,982 --> 02:03:00,351
We have sighted OSSA mini-sub,
bearing 105.

1628
02:03:00,610 --> 02:03:01,607
Repeat. Bearing 105.

1629
02:03:03,239 --> 02:03:05,908
Preparing to make contact
for decompression procedure.

1630
02:03:18,962 --> 02:03:20,208
What's going on?

1631
02:03:20,464 --> 02:03:22,006
More of nothing.

1632
02:03:26,845 --> 02:03:29,716
I want to thank you for saving my life.

1633
02:03:31,058 --> 02:03:33,430
Interesting life to save.

1634
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:39,390
You get some sleep.

1635
02:03:39,650 --> 02:03:42,817
I have no idea what to tell them
when they debrief us.

1636
02:03:54,290 --> 02:03:55,867
My back is killing me.

1637
02:03:56,459 --> 02:04:00,670
Next time I have to remember to stretch
before I jettison from a mini-sub.

1638
02:04:13,309 --> 02:04:15,978
We've been trapped in here
for about 3 days.

1639
02:04:16,312 --> 02:04:19,764
They want an explanation. We ought
to figure out what we want to tell them.

1640
02:04:20,358 --> 02:04:23,275
Killer jellyfish, squid, sea snakes. . .

1641
02:04:23,528 --> 02:04:27,940
. . .and an alien being in the form
of a giant totemic golden ball? Please.

1642
02:04:29,033 --> 02:04:33,660
We destroyed $1 00 million worth
of equipment down there and people died.

1643
02:04:34,497 --> 02:04:36,904
They want answers.
What do you guys want to tell them?

1644
02:04:38,794 --> 02:04:39,824
Why aren't we dead?

1645
02:04:40,211 --> 02:04:41,160
What?

1646
02:04:41,421 --> 02:04:42,203
You said. . .

1647
02:04:42,547 --> 02:04:44,338
"The future can't be changed. "

1648
02:04:45,174 --> 02:04:46,455
It can't.

1649
02:04:46,843 --> 02:04:50,294
But in the spaceship they called it
an Unknown Entry Event.

1650
02:04:51,056 --> 02:04:54,673
Like we never got here alive
to tell them about it.

1651
02:04:55,310 --> 02:05:00,102
You said we wouldn't survive. If you
can't change the future, we'd be dead.

1652
02:05:01,065 --> 02:05:02,809
We're alive.
We're not dead.

1653
02:05:04,986 --> 02:05:08,106
And in 2 minutes we'll be in a room
full of military guys.

1654
02:05:08,364 --> 02:05:10,107
They know about the Sphere.

1655
02:05:10,367 --> 02:05:14,447
We know Barnes got ahold of them
before we lost contact to the surface.

1656
02:05:14,704 --> 02:05:15,784
What do you want to tell them?

1657
02:05:16,582 --> 02:05:18,906
Why bother?
The Sphere's destroyed.

1658
02:05:19,251 --> 02:05:21,623
But we still have the power,
am I right?

1659
02:05:24,380 --> 02:05:27,465
I don't know if I trust them with it.
I don't know if I trust you.

1660
02:05:27,843 --> 02:05:32,006
I don't want to not be able to sleep,
afraid I'll wake up. . .

1661
02:05:32,264 --> 02:05:34,422
. . .having manifested
some nightmare. . .

1662
02:05:34,683 --> 02:05:37,518
. . .and there's all kinds
of weird things in my apartment.

1663
02:05:37,894 --> 02:05:39,093
That's a frightening thought.

1664
02:05:39,354 --> 02:05:40,599
No kidding.

1665
02:05:41,773 --> 02:05:42,888
So. . .

1666
02:05:44,234 --> 02:05:46,025
. . .if we still have the power. . .

1667
02:05:47,362 --> 02:05:49,022
. . .what do you want to do with it?

1668
02:05:54,536 --> 02:05:56,244
God knows what they'll do with it.

1669
02:05:57,039 --> 02:06:00,906
Are you worried what will happen
if it falls into the wrong hands?

1670
02:06:01,251 --> 02:06:03,789
Yeah. Frankly, I don't know
what the wrong hands are.

1671
02:06:04,046 --> 02:06:06,667
Or what's worse:
the wrong hands or our hands.

1672
02:06:06,924 --> 02:06:08,715
We are the wrong hands.

1673
02:06:09,384 --> 02:06:10,795
We proved it.

1674
02:06:11,094 --> 02:06:15,638
You know, the 3 of us are enlightened
people, we're intelligent. . .

1675
02:06:15,891 --> 02:06:18,049
. . .we even recycle
our cans and bottles.

1676
02:06:18,436 --> 02:06:22,349
But when we got our shot,
we manifested every mean. . .

1677
02:06:22,606 --> 02:06:26,853
. . .distorting, vengeful,
paranoid thought you could think of.

1678
02:06:27,403 --> 02:06:28,565
We did.

1679
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:29,401
Right?

1680
02:06:29,947 --> 02:06:31,774
You believe we still have the power.

1681
02:06:32,408 --> 02:06:35,112
Of course we still have it.

1682
02:06:35,953 --> 02:06:38,491
And that's the answer to the equation.

1683
02:06:39,123 --> 02:06:40,914
We can't change the future.

1684
02:06:41,167 --> 02:06:44,701
We're not dead.
But they don't know. Why?

1685
02:06:46,463 --> 02:06:47,495
I'm not following you.

1686
02:06:48,341 --> 02:06:51,128
Because we have the power. . .

1687
02:06:51,636 --> 02:06:53,095
. . .to forget.

1688
02:06:55,973 --> 02:06:57,302
To forget.

1689
02:06:57,934 --> 02:06:59,843
You want us to agree to forget?

1690
02:07:00,102 --> 02:07:03,020
Wait a minute, are we sure
that we want to do this?

1691
02:07:03,355 --> 02:07:04,601
Yes.

1692
02:07:07,777 --> 02:07:10,315
This is the greatest discovery
in the history of mankind.

1693
02:07:10,571 --> 02:07:13,026
We're just going to white it out
like it's a typing error?

1694
02:07:14,533 --> 02:07:15,814
I'm sure.

1695
02:07:18,496 --> 02:07:19,955
What about you, Beth?

1696
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:22,409
What's the matter, Norman?

1697
02:07:22,666 --> 02:07:24,743
It's a little hard to let go of.

1698
02:07:25,002 --> 02:07:26,331
Something that could've been. . .

1699
02:07:27,338 --> 02:07:28,832
. . .this gift?

1700
02:07:29,299 --> 02:07:31,624
The power to make your dreams
come true.

1701
02:07:32,176 --> 02:07:35,131
We're given the greatest gift
in the history of mankind.

1702
02:07:35,513 --> 02:07:37,137
We're given this magic ball.

1703
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:38,421
And it says...

1704
02:07:38,683 --> 02:07:43,013
"Imagine what you will
and you can have it. "

1705
02:07:44,481 --> 02:07:47,897
That's an extraordinary gift,
but we're so primitive we. . . .

1706
02:07:49,986 --> 02:07:53,189
We manifested the worst in us,
because what we have inside us. . .

1707
02:07:53,448 --> 02:07:57,777
. . .is what we have inside of us, instead
of the best of us. What does that say?

1708
02:08:00,413 --> 02:08:02,157
We weren't ready, Norman.

1709
02:08:03,333 --> 02:08:06,204
We have what's called an imagination.

1710
02:08:08,379 --> 02:08:11,629
I mean, look what we're capable of.

1711
02:08:11,884 --> 02:08:13,046
We can. . . .

1712
02:08:19,099 --> 02:08:20,509
We're not ready.

1713
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:28,064
A long time ago. . .

1714
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:31,394
. . .I did something very. . .

1715
02:08:31,736 --> 02:08:34,654
. . .very inappropriate with you,
and I'm sorry.

1716
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:36,898
Okay?

1717
02:08:37,159 --> 02:08:38,072
Okay.

1718
02:08:39,078 --> 02:08:43,206
I don't have any answers, Norman,
but these guys are coming so let's. . . .

1719
02:08:43,707 --> 02:08:46,708
Okay, we're going to agree to forget. . .

1720
02:08:47,544 --> 02:08:48,707
. . .the Sphere. . .

1721
02:08:49,421 --> 02:08:50,619
. . .the power. . .

1722
02:08:51,423 --> 02:08:52,918
. . .all that ever was.

1723
02:08:59,390 --> 02:09:02,640
I don't know how to get this going.
You're the mathematician.

1724
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:04,518
How about we just count to 3?

1725
02:09:04,937 --> 02:09:06,728
I couldn't have come up with that.

1726
02:09:10,067 --> 02:09:11,443
I'll start.

1727
02:09:15,113 --> 02:09:15,778
One.

1728
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:24,076
Two.

1729
02:09:27,126 --> 02:09:28,406
Three.

1730
02:09:37,929 --> 02:09:41,049
Can somebody tell me
what the hell that's supposed to be?

1731
02:09:50,608 --> 02:09:52,102
Why are you holding my hand?

1732
02:09:52,360 --> 02:09:54,732
No, you were holding my hand.
