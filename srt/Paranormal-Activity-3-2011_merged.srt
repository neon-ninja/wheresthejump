1
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:05,722
You'll be spending
a lot of time in here.

2
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,640
This is gonna be your room.

3
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:11,227
There's some kind of animal being
de-liced or something.

4
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:13,897
Compression chamber.
That's your crib.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,691
It's hermetically sealed.

6
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:19,736
And this is your paint color.

7
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:23,239
- What color is that, hon?
- Jamaica Bay Blue.

8
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:26,493
Jamaica! And there you are.

9
00:00:27,036 --> 00:00:28,578
- Hi.
- Yes, hi.

10
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:29,746
And there's your dad,

11
00:00:29,872 --> 00:00:32,165
who's playing with his new toy
instead of helping me paint.

12
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:34,667
Sorry. I can help.

13
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:36,836
- Yeah? Come on.
- If I wasn't...

14
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:37,921
If I wasn't filming I would help.

15
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:40,006
Go and get the other ladder.

16
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,425
Yeah, you should have
a real ladder. That's... You know.

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,843
All right, that's a...

18
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:45,512
- Who's that?
- It's my sister.

19
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:46,763
She's here to check out the nursery.

20
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:50,517
- Daniel, this is gorgeous.
- Yeah?

21
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:52,936
This is so gorgeous.
I love it. I love the blue.

22
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,938
I'm glad y'all went with that.
It's much better than the green.

23
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:56,773
- How are you feeling?
- All right.

24
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,191
You know, I think I'm okay.

25
00:00:58,275 --> 00:00:59,943
- How is he?
- He's doing so good.

26
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:01,611
He's kicking and, like, swimming.

27
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:02,862
- I feel like he's swimming.
- Hey, little fella!

28
00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:04,030
- What did you say?
- It's Hunter.

29
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:05,365
- No! Tyler. It's Tyler.
- I like that.

30
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:06,950
- It's Tyler Hunter.
- It's...

31
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:08,868
I like... I like both.
I don't wanna choose.

32
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:10,870
- I'm not gonna get into this.
- You have to. Come on.

33
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:13,540
In preparation for the big move,
I have a couple of boxes in my car

34
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:16,876
that I would
love to throw in your basement.

35
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:18,878
Please?

36
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:20,547
- This is the last box.
- Really?

37
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:22,757
Probably.

38
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,968
Oh, God!

39
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,806
So, a little bit nervous?

40
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,641
No, I'm excited.

41
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,142
I spend all my time
over at Micah's anyway.

42
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:36,729
VHS? That is old school.

43
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:39,065
Do we have a VCR?

44
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:41,401
I didn't even know
you had this much stuff.

45
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:44,320
Somehow I ended up with it
after Grandma Lois died.

46
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:46,573
I haven't even gone through it.

47
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:49,242
- How come you got it?
- I don't know. You can have it.

48
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:50,577
Nobody ever gives me anything.

49
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:52,412
So who's gonna get the top bunk?

50
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:54,581
We're not 12.

51
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:57,000
We can get a VCR for free.

52
00:01:57,835 --> 00:02:00,086
You know, I don't remember these at all.

53
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,629
You guys didn't go Beta, huh?

54
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,012
That's fine, okay?
I'm just gonna tape over an old one.

55
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,179
Can you get Abby out of here, please?

56
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,347
She's gonna get cut on the glass!

57
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,933
We just got back and the whole
place is pretty much destroyed.

58
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:15,518
Nothing seems to be actually missing.

59
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:16,769
It's just, everything's really...

60
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:18,187
That's what she's telling me.

61
00:02:18,314 --> 00:02:19,522
Just make sure
we document everything.

62
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:20,648
Don't touch anything.

63
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,448
This is our basement.

64
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:29,866
I don't see anything really broken.

65
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,536
I don't see that box of tapes
that Katie brought over.

66
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:36,205
Looks like that's the
only thing that's missing.

67
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:47,133
All right and there she is.

68
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:49,636
The mother of the birthday girl,
my girlfriend...

69
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,054
Chocolate, chocolate, rainbow stuff.

70
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,139
- That is a good-looking cake.
- Which is exactly what she wanted.

71
00:02:53,223 --> 00:02:57,352
Beautiful. Just beautiful. And you're
beautiful. I don't know how you do it.

72
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,022
Are you okay?

73
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,402
Watch your backs!

74
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:13,493
Watch your hair. Good job.

75
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:17,497
All right, and here's the birthday girl.

76
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:18,581
I found some.

77
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:22,752
She looks pretty unhappy.
Something's going on.

78
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,587
We got the young one.
Under the trampoline.

79
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,756
- Twenty bites and that's about all.
- Twenty bites?

80
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,341
That's what my mother
used to make me do.

81
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:29,926
That's a lot of cake on that plate.

82
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:31,761
Hey, Julie. Go get Kristi.

83
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:36,766
Say hi, Kristi!

84
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,892
Hi.

85
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:41,020
Kristi's a little shy.

86
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:42,689
That's cute. They love each other.

87
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:46,401
It's Grandma.
Happy, happy, happy birthday.

88
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:50,279
Never forget the day you were born.
I held you in my arms

89
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:53,199
and you made me laugh and cry
at the same time. You were so cute.

90
00:03:53,283 --> 00:03:55,118
Serious piece of equipment,
so be careful.

91
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,203
How do you shoot
those weddings with this thing?

92
00:03:57,287 --> 00:04:00,456
- It must hurt your back.
- It's something...

93
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:02,208
You have to work certain parts of your...

94
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:04,627
I've only been here for a few months...

95
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:07,255
But thank you
for welcoming me into your family.

96
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:09,382
I...

97
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,884
- I just... I love you, and I love...
- Dennis, my shoulder.

98
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:13,136
...you so much. Happy birthday.

99
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:14,303
- Okay, take this thing now.
- All right.

100
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:16,889
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

101
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,521
Katie, take it easy.
Take it easy. It's dead.

102
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:24,605
You're a little monster.

103
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:29,819
- All right, all right, I got my camera.
- Here, let me help you, 'cause I don't...

104
00:04:29,945 --> 00:04:31,154
- I want to see the tooth full throttle.
- Okay, all right.

105
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,321
This thing's coming out today.

106
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:34,657
- Is it okay if I push it a little?
- No, no, don't push it.

107
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:35,908
- Lower lip.
- Want some juice, babe?

108
00:04:35,993 --> 00:04:37,076
- Down.
- Here.

109
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:38,161
Now...

110
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:39,579
- You want some of this?
- Yeah, orange juice.

111
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:42,498
That is... That is a good one!

112
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:46,085
- All right.
- Let's see this. Open up.

113
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,463
Don't push it with your tongue.
Let's see.

114
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,423
It's ready.

115
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,258
- I think it might be...
- It's ready.

116
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:55,428
You're gonna get a newjob as a dentist.

117
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:57,930
Thank you. You think I'm good?

118
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:00,600
Wrap it in a tissue, put it in your pocket,

119
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:02,935
and bring it home for...

120
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,854
- The Tooth Fairy.
- The Tooth Fairy, that's right.

121
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,022
And we'll put it
under your pillow, tonight.

122
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,273
Wow. You like the Tooth Fairy, right?

123
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:08,441
We love the Tooth Fairy.

124
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:09,609
Why does he need a bowl?

125
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:10,860
Because he wants to eat.

126
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:11,944
He's hungry?

127
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:14,030
Kristi, Toby isn't real.

128
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:17,116
- Hey. It doesn't matter.
- Yes, he is.

129
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:36,219
My assistant Randy is currently
43 minutes late.

130
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,763
And this isn't the first time,
he's always late.

131
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:41,349
So, today we're gonna

132
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:45,311
play a little prank and see
if we can teach him a lesson.

133
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:54,570
- Come on around the front door.
- Come on, just open the garage.

134
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,281
Randy, I need your help, man.
Come around the front door.

135
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:58,366
Okay, okay.

136
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,535
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

137
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:04,080
- Where were you? What happened?
- Sorry I'm late. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

138
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,581
- Hey.
- I got blocked in.

139
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,832
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right, man.

140
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:10,127
I had a leak in the house.
I was hoping you'd get here sooner.

141
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:12,838
I had a leak in the ceiling here.

142
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:14,632
- Really?
- Yeah. Here, push this up here.

143
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:15,675
It didn't rain last night.

144
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,759
Hold this for a second. I need your help.

145
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,470
It's been going like crazy.
And I don't know what to do,

146
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:21,180
- so I got that pole there.
- Why is it white?

147
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:23,057
- What?
- Why is it white?

148
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:26,727
I don't know. I think it's maybe
something with the paint on this.

149
00:06:26,812 --> 00:06:29,438
Anyway, I gotta get some spackle.
I'll be back.

150
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,232
- Wait, you just want me to...
- Hang on.

151
00:06:31,316 --> 00:06:33,442
- You want me to wait here and hold it?
- Thanks, Randy.

152
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:37,071
Wait, Dennis.
I'm just supposed to wait here? Dennis.

153
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:39,115
Dennis!

154
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:41,075
- Hey.
- Okay, girls, that's far enough.

155
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,954
Hey. No. Why don't you come on in
and hand me that ladder?

156
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
No.

157
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,707
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

158
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,418
You know you don't have to listen to
him. He's not even your real dad.

159
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:51,627
Who wants to go jump
on the trampoline?

160
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,296
- I do!
- Oh, come on.

161
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,714
- I have a new trick to show you.
- Okay.

162
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:56,549
Guys, come on.

163
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:57,967
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- Ready for a surprise?

164
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,343
It better be a ladder.

165
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:01,387
We were playing outside.
What did we find, guys?

166
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:03,306
- A spider.
- Dennis.

167
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,974
- We've got a cute little spider.
- Dennis!

168
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:07,059
- Come on, man.
- Okay. Yeah?

169
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:09,145
- Do it, do it, do it, do it!
- All right.

170
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,605
Run!

171
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:15,359
- It wasn't even a spider.
- That really hurt. That really hurt.

172
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:20,823
- Hi.
- Big day today, right?

173
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:21,949
- Yep.
- What's today?

174
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:23,367
- Picture day.
- Picture day!

175
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:24,493
- Dennis, you're still in.
- Sorry.

176
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,287
- I was finishing my hair!
- This picture's for Grandma.

177
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:27,663
Smile.

178
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:30,791
All right!

179
00:07:31,043 --> 00:07:32,335
- Okay...
- Kristi, come on!

180
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:33,961
Here it goes.

181
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,173
All right.

182
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:39,008
Cheese.

183
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:44,305
- Thanks, sweetheart.
- No, no, no. Seriously, like...

184
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:46,891
- Randy?
- Yeah.

185
00:07:48,393 --> 00:07:50,728
Where did you find this girl?

186
00:07:51,313 --> 00:07:53,898
I don't know. I didn't see her
at all throughout any of the wedding...

187
00:07:57,361 --> 00:08:00,154
- That's because I'm so happy...
- "So happy for you."

188
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:01,614
I love my job, man.

189
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:04,116
- I should've got her number.
- Probably could've.

190
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:07,703
Randy, this is great stuff.
I can't use any of this, but it's great.

191
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,225
Jule?

192
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:49,036
Julie?

193
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,747
There it goes again.

194
00:08:58,255 --> 00:08:59,839
Hello?

195
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:01,090
Julie?

196
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:01,442
I like this song!

197
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:04,820
Not bad.

198
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,157
That's pretty good.

199
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:11,911
Teddy? Did you fall down?

200
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,642
What was that?

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

202
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:13,305
- Hey.
- Hey.

203
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,140
What you doing?

204
00:11:15,225 --> 00:11:16,642
Nothing. I was just looking around.

205
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:18,644
What... What...
You guys just get home?

206
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:19,812
Yeah.

207
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,314
- It was girls' day.
- I know. How was it?

208
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,316
- Was it fun?
- Great.

209
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:27,903
You just really snuck up on me there.

210
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:31,407
All right. It's time.

211
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,409
- Don't film this.
- Why not?

212
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:35,911
It's illegal.

213
00:11:36,413 --> 00:11:37,413
Don't laugh.

214
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:40,332
We haven't even started smoking it,
and you're already paranoid.

215
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,251
It's illegal.
What if my kids find me? I'm a mother.

216
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:44,169
- Now relax.
- Seriously, Dennis.

217
00:11:44,254 --> 00:11:45,337
Seriously, Julie.

218
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,756
Let's get really serious. Seriously.

219
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:48,841
- Shut up.
- Let's be serious.

220
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:51,802
- All right.
- Real, real, real big, big...

221
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:53,804
That was big.

222
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:57,474
Julie, do the voice.

223
00:11:57,601 --> 00:11:59,602
Dennis.

224
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:01,770
What voice?

225
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,690
This voice?

226
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:11,155
Dennis, I can't believe
you're filming me smoke marijuana.

227
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:18,287
God, you're so beautiful.

228
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:19,622
Shut up.

229
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,460
I want to film us having sex.

230
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:29,590
Is that perverted?

231
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:33,135
- Is that weird?
- I don't know.

232
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:36,847
Was that a yes?

233
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:39,934
Okay.

234
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,811
- Really?
- Yeah.

235
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:50,986
Hey, there, pretty lady.

236
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:54,573
Stop. I don't know.

237
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:57,660
You sure... You sure you're up for this?

238
00:12:57,786 --> 00:12:58,827
No.

239
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:00,204
You know what? Don't answer that.

240
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,706
Hurry up, before I change my mind.

241
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,833
Okay, sorry.

242
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:08,796
All right.

243
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:17,388
What are you doing? What was that?

244
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:18,555
It's porno music.

245
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:21,642
Great. Classy.

246
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:27,398
Good start.

247
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:29,191
Good, right?

248
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:33,195
- All right.
- I don't know.

249
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,305
Relax. Just relax.

250
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,224
Don't worry about it.

251
00:14:05,437 --> 00:14:08,439
Hey.

252
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:10,399
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- Relax.

253
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:30,711
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.

254
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

255
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:47,644
It's an earthquake.

256
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:50,397
- Holy shit!
- Dennis, it's an earthquake!

257
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:53,650
The girls. The girls!

258
00:14:53,777 --> 00:14:55,819
Come on! Dennis!

259
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,061
Dennis. Oh, my God, I look so fat.

260
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:30,229
You don't look fat.

261
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:32,022
- Look at the size of me on top of you.
- You look beautiful.

262
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:34,149
You look like you can't breathe
'cause I'm sitting on top of you.

263
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:35,651
I want another shot
at doing one of these.

264
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:37,069
- Watch this.
- Dennis, you have to erase this.

265
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:38,570
Julie, watch, watch, watch.

266
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:40,322
- See that?
- What?

267
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,907
Did you see that in the corner?

268
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:44,618
Yeah, I see, like, dust.

269
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:46,578
- Dirt falling.
- No, Julie.

270
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:47,788
There's something there.

271
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:49,706
- You are crazy.
- There was something there.

272
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,833
Wait, you can see something there.

273
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,000
It's very cute,
but you're going a little crazy.

274
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:55,212
You're like one of those people
that see things, like in their food.

275
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:57,256
Like when people think
they see the Virgin Mary in their toast.

276
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,423
- That's you right now.
- That's hilarious.

277
00:15:58,508 --> 00:16:00,717
This has to be erased
and this has to be erased.

278
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,970
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.

279
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:05,931
I'm late. I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.

280
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:08,642
You know,
you're going to regret saying that.

281
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:09,768
Doubt it.

282
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:11,979
I don't think you can go a day
without having sex, personally.

283
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:13,438
Don't dare me.

284
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:16,024
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.

285
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:19,111
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.

286
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:21,655
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.

287
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,198
I know, it's my car!

288
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:24,575
I got the earthquake.

289
00:16:24,701 --> 00:16:26,493
- Did you really?
- On tape.

290
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:27,744
It's scary, right? Is that Julie?

291
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:28,912
It's nothing, it's nothing.

292
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:30,414
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?

293
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,749
Yeah. I got...
This weird thing happened after...

294
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:33,917
She let you make a sex tape?

295
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:35,961
Yeah, but it got interrupted
by the earthquake.

296
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:37,629
I wouldn't have let
anything interrupt that.

297
00:16:37,714 --> 00:16:39,840
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?

298
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:41,967
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.

299
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,343
Check this out. Ready?

300
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:45,137
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.

301
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:46,263
Okay.

302
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:47,389
I'm gonna take the color out.

303
00:16:47,515 --> 00:16:50,267
It looks like dust is falling on something.

304
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:52,060
It looks like a figure, right?

305
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:53,353
- You see that?
- Yeah.

306
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:55,105
Did you catch that?

307
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:56,481
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?

308
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:57,983
- It moved, right?
- What was that?

309
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,651
I don't know. Check it out.

310
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:01,195
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.

311
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,906
You know, I've been hearing
these noises in the girls' room lately.

312
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:06,325
I don't know. I feel like it's...

313
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:07,784
Something weird's going on.

314
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:10,120
- Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.

315
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:14,499
Hey, I wanted to talk to you...

316
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:15,626
Dennis!

317
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:16,752
Sorry! Sorry.

318
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Oh, my God!

319
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:19,046
Sorry.

320
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,089
You mind if I set up
a couple cameras around the house?

321
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:23,008
I'm not going to talk to you right now.

322
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:25,093
Okay, I'll... I'll take that as a yes?

323
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,930
- I hate you!
- Okay. Love you, too.

324
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:31,516
How long do the tapes last?

325
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:32,851
About six hours each.

326
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:34,978
So you have to change
them every six hours?

327
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:36,313
Yes.

328
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:39,524
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?

329
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:41,735
- Okay. Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...

330
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:43,445
Keep going.

331
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:45,822
- Can I see it?
- Sure.

332
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:48,033
Here. Come here. See it?

333
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:49,201
Yeah.

334
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:51,203
Pretty cool, right?

335
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,121
So, what are you trying to see?

336
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:55,040
Anything unusual or strange.

337
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:57,042
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.

338
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:58,710
- Kristi?
- Yeah?

339
00:17:58,795 --> 00:18:00,379
Don't touch the camera or anything.

340
00:18:00,463 --> 00:18:01,964
Katie, just leave it alone.

341
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:10,055
- Dennis.
- What?

342
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:11,306
Really?

343
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:14,559
Don't you think
you're overreacting a little?

344
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:15,852
This is a new house.

345
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:18,021
It shouldn't be making these noises.

346
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:21,149
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.

347
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:24,695
No...

348
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:28,282
This is not gonna work here.

349
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:30,742
Like, what do you think
you're gonna catch?

350
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:32,828
Whatever's in our house.

351
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:37,457
Right, 'cause there's
something here watching us.

352
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:42,004
Well, there's definitely something.

353
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,258
I... I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.

354
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:47,926
Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.

355
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:49,094
I feel a camera.

356
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:52,806
The earthquake, and all those...

357
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,058
I don't know,
stuff that's been happening and...

358
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:57,019
I don't know, I just...

359
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,396
No, it's totally normal.

360
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,235
Bye, camera.

361
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:09,323
Good night, camera.

362
00:20:12,053 --> 00:20:13,220
Yeah?

363
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:17,265
Yeah, probably.

364
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:20,352
In their bedroom.

365
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:23,105
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.

366
00:20:24,565 --> 00:20:26,441
It's okay.

367
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:30,737
Why?

368
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,786
Yeah, kind of.

369
00:20:37,912 --> 00:20:39,621
He's very sweet.

370
00:20:54,595 --> 00:20:56,596
Yeah, I saw that.

371
00:20:56,931 --> 00:20:58,807
I watched some of the tapes
on the camera

372
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:02,185
and I saw you
talking to somebody late last night.

373
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:05,981
If you saw me talking to somebody,
it would be Toby.

374
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,775
Toby's your friend?

375
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,444
Yes. He's my friend.

376
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:12,654
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?

377
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,905
Secrets.

378
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,324
He's big?

379
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,326
So, is he old, like Grandma,

380
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:20,370
or is he young, like you?

381
00:21:21,664 --> 00:21:23,999
He's old, like Grandma.

382
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,084
And what does he look like?

383
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:28,837
Is he tall? Is he fat?

384
00:21:28,963 --> 00:21:30,714
He's tall. He's tall.

385
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:33,717
Don't call him fat.

386
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:36,928
Kristi, when you say that
if you tell one of your secrets

387
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:40,140
that you'll be in trouble with Toby,
what does that mean?

388
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,642
Well, I won't be safe.

389
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:46,771
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?

390
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:47,898
No.

391
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:50,942
But I won't be safe.

392
00:21:51,027 --> 00:21:53,320
That means, I will be, like...

393
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,032
Be in very, very big trouble.

394
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,284
Big trouble.

395
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:00,535
- You saw her.
- That's how it is.

396
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:02,037
It was like he was actually there, right?

397
00:22:02,163 --> 00:22:03,163
I know.

398
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:05,665
Because that's how active
kids' imaginations are.

399
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,791
It's crazy.

400
00:22:06,876 --> 00:22:08,126
I mean, imagination is one thing.

401
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:09,836
She got up in the middle of the night.

402
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:12,380
I mean, it's a little odd
that she got up in the middle...

403
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:14,966
You haven't been around kids
for that long. They do weird things.

404
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:17,719
They... Katie used to get up
in the middle of the night

405
00:22:17,845 --> 00:22:19,429
and she used to sleep on the toilet.

406
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:20,722
What?

407
00:22:20,848 --> 00:22:21,973
Okay? I'm serious.

408
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:23,099
Really?

409
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:26,811
Yes. Toby is a phase and he's going to
be gone in a couple weeks.

410
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:27,938
I know it.

411
00:22:28,064 --> 00:22:29,648
How many hours of footage
do you have?

412
00:22:29,732 --> 00:22:32,776
This is the job, man. I got two cameras,

413
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:35,237
six hours each. Twelve hours.

414
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:37,739
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah. Got to do it, man.

415
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,866
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.

416
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:41,993
Yes. Now, please,
I'm trying to concentrate.

417
00:22:42,078 --> 00:22:44,996
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.

418
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:46,581
- Hey, Julie.
- ...going?

419
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:47,832
Good.

420
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:51,169
You want to step into my office
and do some work with me or...

421
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:53,255
No. You find anything?

422
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:56,466
Yes, actually. We did find something.

423
00:22:56,592 --> 00:23:00,345
We found that
your family sleeps all night.

424
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:01,513
Very funny, Randy.

425
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:02,931
- Keep up the good work.
- Okay.

426
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,849
I love you with all of my heart and soul.

427
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:06,601
I love you, too.

428
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:08,979
It should either be called
Back to the Past...

429
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:10,230
Present. Back to the Present.

430
00:23:10,314 --> 00:23:11,523
- No, no.
- End of story.

431
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:13,441
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes total sense.

432
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:15,485
Let's Get Back to the Present, maybe.

433
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:17,362
But Back to the Past...

434
00:23:17,446 --> 00:23:18,488
Back to the Present.

435
00:23:21,993 --> 00:23:23,618
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

436
00:23:28,124 --> 00:23:29,332
- Was that... That's it.
- What the hell?

437
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,458
It's happening again.

438
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:31,835
Come on.

439
00:23:39,677 --> 00:23:41,136
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

440
00:23:51,522 --> 00:23:54,149
It's in your closet.

441
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:00,238
Are you getting that?

442
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:01,364
Open it.

443
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,533
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah, I'm gettin' it.

444
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

445
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:28,516
Holy shit!

446
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:31,728
Holy shit! That's not funny.

447
00:24:32,855 --> 00:24:35,065
- Oh, my God. You're both crazy.
- I got you guys so bad.

448
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:37,442
- I got you.
- You're both crazy.

449
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:39,736
I got you good.
I got you, too. Are you okay?

450
00:24:39,862 --> 00:24:41,279
Just go ahead
and take your crap right there,

451
00:24:41,364 --> 00:24:43,281
'cause I nearly crapped my pants.

452
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:45,325
Holy fuck!
You almost gave me a heart attack.

453
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:46,993
Oh, my God, get away!

454
00:24:47,078 --> 00:24:48,787
- Get away from me.
- Are you okay?

455
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:50,038
Get away. I hate you.

456
00:24:57,213 --> 00:25:01,424
Wow. Look at that tent.

457
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:03,468
Gosh. I like this tent.

458
00:25:03,552 --> 00:25:06,012
"...and disguised his voice to sound
like Little Red Riding Hood.

459
00:25:06,097 --> 00:25:08,973
"The poor old woman, before she could
even scream, the wolf gobbled her up."

460
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:11,935
Hello. Hey, guys.

461
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:13,520
- How you doing?
- Good.

462
00:25:13,604 --> 00:25:15,313
- Good.
- That's a little bright.

463
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:16,439
I'm sorry.

464
00:25:16,565 --> 00:25:19,484
- Guys? I got you a little...
- Give it to me.

465
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:21,486
Hey, guys. Don't tell Mom, okay?

466
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,862
- Okay.
- All right.

467
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:24,239
What are you guys doing?

468
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:26,449
You'll see.
We've got a little surprise for you.

469
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:29,244
- One, two, three!
- ...two, three!

470
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:31,955
Come here.

471
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:34,833
Here, tickle torture,
tickle torture, tickle torture!

472
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:38,962
That's enough.
You guys are locked in the dungeon.

473
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:40,463
All right. Good night, girls. I love you.

474
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:42,298
- Love you, Dennis.
- Love you.

475
00:27:09,512 --> 00:27:11,304
Dennis. Dennis.

476
00:27:11,388 --> 00:27:12,764
- What?
- Listen.

477
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:15,642
What?

478
00:27:15,726 --> 00:27:17,936
I think the girls came inside.

479
00:27:19,063 --> 00:27:21,689
I'll go check on them. I got it.

480
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:39,374
Girls?

481
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:09,487
Dennis.

482
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:13,575
Dennis?

483
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Don't do that to me.

484
00:28:40,644 --> 00:28:41,769
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You scared me.

485
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,607
Did you check on them?

486
00:28:51,155 --> 00:28:53,990
Why is this door locked?
Did you lock this?

487
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:02,749
What's the matter?

488
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:04,250
We're just checking on you guys.

489
00:29:04,335 --> 00:29:05,501
Move that light.

490
00:29:05,628 --> 00:29:06,920
We're gonna move inside, okay?

491
00:29:07,004 --> 00:29:08,838
- I want to stay here.
- Why?

492
00:29:08,964 --> 00:29:10,506
I'm sorry. It's gonna be fun inside,
too, though.

493
00:29:10,633 --> 00:29:11,883
Come on. Get your stuff.
We're gonna camp inside.

494
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:13,092
- Mommy. Why?
- What?

495
00:29:13,177 --> 00:29:14,218
Dennis, will you film me?

496
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:15,762
- Yep.
- I wanna show you something.

497
00:29:15,846 --> 00:29:19,682
You know Spud Webb?
One, two, three, slam dunk!

498
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:21,517
Very impressive. Very good.

499
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:22,810
Thank you. Thank you.

500
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:24,979
Katie, are you sure you didn't sneak
into the house last night?

501
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:26,397
My gosh, I pinky swear,

502
00:29:26,482 --> 00:29:27,607
- I did not go into the house.
- Okay.

503
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:29,317
You wanna do me a favor?
Can you tell your mom that?

504
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,904
Where's Dennis?

505
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:35,281
He's out, buying more tapes.

506
00:29:37,117 --> 00:29:38,993
With your credit card?

507
00:29:40,287 --> 00:29:41,329
Mom.

508
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:44,582
He doesn't have any money.

509
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,292
That is not true.

510
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:47,961
The girls love him.

511
00:29:48,045 --> 00:29:52,256
I mean, they just about think
he's the coolest guy ever.

512
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:55,760
I mean, I really, really do like him.
I mean that.

513
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:58,638
It's just that the girls miss their father.

514
00:29:58,722 --> 00:30:00,181
I don't know.

515
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,977
I wish he were
a little more financially secure.

516
00:30:04,061 --> 00:30:05,979
He is financially secure, Mom.
He has a job.

517
00:30:06,063 --> 00:30:08,314
- He shoots wedding videos.
- No. That's... No.

518
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,067
He has his own business.

519
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,443
You know? It's a whole different thing.

520
00:30:12,528 --> 00:30:14,070
My God, Mom. I just told you,

521
00:30:14,154 --> 00:30:16,114
I don't want to have any more kids.

522
00:30:16,198 --> 00:30:18,783
I'm not gonna get pregnant.

523
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:20,201
You always said
you wanted a big family.

524
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:24,122
I changed my mind, okay?
I have two beautiful girls.

525
00:30:24,206 --> 00:30:25,623
You always wanted a son.

526
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,043
I'm happy with the way things are.
Let's go.

527
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,519
What the...

528
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,356
Fuck.

529
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

530
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:56,899
This is great. Hang on.

531
00:32:56,984 --> 00:32:59,861
That's great! Katie, that's great.
You're doing really good.

532
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,487
- Thank you.
- Let her go, Jule.

533
00:33:01,572 --> 00:33:03,364
Dennis, I totally believe in this shit.

534
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,158
Randy, watch the language.

535
00:33:05,242 --> 00:33:06,450
All right, nice and slow.

536
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,661
My brother saw one once.

537
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:09,871
- Really?
- Yeah.

538
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:10,997
What's Bloody Mary?

539
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:13,207
You don't know what Bloody Mary is?

540
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,501
It's where you go in the bathroom

541
00:33:15,586 --> 00:33:18,254
and you say "Bloody Mary" three times
in the mirror and then you see a ghost.

542
00:33:18,338 --> 00:33:19,463
Dennis, I wanna play Bloody Mary.

543
00:33:19,548 --> 00:33:20,923
Nothing, don't worry. It's okay.

544
00:33:21,008 --> 00:33:22,049
You say Bloody Mary three times.

545
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:23,217
I want to play!
I want to see a ghost.

546
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:26,137
I'm just saying you're missing
half of the stuff in the house

547
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:27,346
without cameras down there.

548
00:33:27,431 --> 00:33:28,848
I know. You don't have to tell me.

549
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:31,726
Like put it up in the corner, like,
rack it up in the corner or something?

550
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,437
It just doesn't work. It just...

551
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:36,772
It's not a wide enough angle.

552
00:33:36,857 --> 00:33:38,900
And I don't even...
They don't even make lenses that wide.

553
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:41,068
Mirrors.

554
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,236
You could use mirrors.

555
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,784
- This thing is so cool.
- Pretty cool, right?

556
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:50,620
It's awesome. Wow!

557
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:55,583
Look, you got it
balanced out and everything, too.

558
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:57,752
What is that?

559
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,170
I got to work out some kinks.

560
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:04,926
Oh, man.

561
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:11,265
- Hi.
- Hey.

562
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,517
What is that?

563
00:34:13,602 --> 00:34:14,977
Check it out.

564
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:16,520
My new thing.

565
00:34:17,231 --> 00:34:18,814
- It's pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.

566
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:22,401
- What... What is it?
- I took your fan...

567
00:34:22,486 --> 00:34:25,655
And basically, took apart...

568
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:28,783
Basically, the oscillator
on your fan allows me to see

569
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,785
both in the living room
and in the kitchen.

570
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,287
Cool. Wait, what? You broke my fan?

571
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,165
I can put it back together.

572
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,792
Okay, MacGyver.

573
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,711
It's cool, right?

574
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:42,421
This way I can...

575
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:40,122
Kristi, what are you doing?

576
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,585
- Nothing.
- Go back to bed. It's really late.

577
00:36:58,058 --> 00:37:00,684
Hey, babe, what are you doing up here?

578
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,270
Painting.

579
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:07,525
Don't you want to play outside?

580
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,402
Not really.

581
00:37:09,736 --> 00:37:11,821
How about your friend Toby?
Do you still talk to him?

582
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:12,988
Yeah.

583
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,409
Did he wake you up?

584
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,244
No.

585
00:37:18,328 --> 00:37:19,954
Did he tell you to come downstairs?

586
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:21,080
No.

587
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:25,835
You know you can tell me, right?

588
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:28,087
He told me not to talk about it.

589
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:30,756
Why don't you just ask him yourself?

590
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:33,175
He's standing right next to you.

591
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:42,935
I don't see him.

592
00:37:43,979 --> 00:37:45,104
He's there.

593
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,730
Hey, thanks for getting these, man.

594
00:37:46,815 --> 00:37:47,857
Yeah, of course.

595
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:50,234
- This is good stuff.
- Thanks.

596
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:51,777
- Randy...
- Yeah?

597
00:37:51,862 --> 00:37:53,487
Did you check this out?

598
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:55,531
No, I don't have a library card.

599
00:37:55,615 --> 00:37:57,491
You stole these?

600
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,326
I didn't steal them, Dennis.

601
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:00,995
You told me to get the books,
I got you the books.

602
00:38:01,121 --> 00:38:02,663
It's what a library is. It's for borrowing.

603
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:03,873
That's what "library"
means in Spanish...

604
00:38:03,957 --> 00:38:06,250
It means, "Borrow book store."

605
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:09,295
Malevolent Entities. What is this one?

606
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,173
I don't know.
I looked through it for a second.

607
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:13,466
It had some creepy pictures...

608
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,342
This stuff is creepy.

609
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,219
Hey.

610
00:38:17,304 --> 00:38:19,722
It's your sister and her friends.

611
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,975
Is that a joke?
What, was that supposed to be funny?

612
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:24,101
Playing field hockey.

613
00:38:24,186 --> 00:38:27,855
Says, "Kids are susceptible
to spiritual contact."

614
00:38:28,565 --> 00:38:30,191
Okay. And?

615
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:32,526
Well, the whole thing
with Kristi and her imaginary friend.

616
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:34,820
Remember, I was telling you
the crazy stuff started happening

617
00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:36,739
only when she started talking
to her imaginary friend.

618
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:39,116
I mean, it must want something.
That's what...

619
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:41,118
You know, that's what the book says.

620
00:38:41,203 --> 00:38:44,246
They don't just stick around
for no reason. It wants something.

621
00:38:44,331 --> 00:38:45,664
What does it want?

622
00:38:45,749 --> 00:38:48,209
Well, the book says
it feeds off of your fear.

623
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,510
Hey, Kristi.

624
00:38:58,345 --> 00:39:00,012
- Kristi.
- Yeah?

625
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:01,764
- Wanna play a game?
- Sure.

626
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,933
Here. What are you doing?

627
00:39:05,185 --> 00:39:06,769
- Playing with my soccer ball?
- Yeah.

628
00:39:06,853 --> 00:39:08,938
Kristi, that's mine. Kristi!

629
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:14,568
Kristi, come on. Kristi, come help me.

630
00:39:14,736 --> 00:39:15,819
What are we doing?

631
00:39:15,904 --> 00:39:18,239
- We're gonna play Bloody Mary.
- Why?

632
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:19,949
Because I wanna try to catch the ghost.

633
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:21,450
Okay. I think it's on.

634
00:39:21,743 --> 00:39:25,079
So, how you play is you say
"Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror

635
00:39:25,247 --> 00:39:27,998
and then her dead body's
supposed to appear

636
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:30,417
- in the mirror and try to kill you.
- Stop! Stop!

637
00:39:30,877 --> 00:39:32,294
Stop, Katie.

638
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:35,923
So, now what do we do?

639
00:39:36,258 --> 00:39:37,883
We have to say "Bloody Mary".

640
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:44,348
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.

641
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:45,516
Bloody Mary.

642
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Kristi, I said three times, not four.
- Sorry.
- I'm scared, Katie.
- We have to be quiet.

643
00:39:54,568 --> 00:39:57,361
- Guys...
- My gosh, Mom! You scared me.

644
00:39:57,445 --> 00:40:00,114
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. We're just playing a game.

645
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:03,534
Okay. Grandma just got here.
Go say hi.

646
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:05,411
- You moved his camera?
- Yeah.

647
00:40:05,495 --> 00:40:06,912
- Is it taping?
- I'll pick it up, I promise.

648
00:40:06,997 --> 00:40:08,706
Yeah. We gotta move it
before he comes home

649
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,583
'cause he's gonna be mad.

650
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:12,459
- You guys wanna go to the pool?
- Yeah.

651
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,794
You wanna go to the pool, Grandma?

652
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:30,431
God damn it.

653
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

654
00:42:58,835 --> 00:43:01,044
- Mom?
- Oh, my God.

655
00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:02,713
Are you okay? Holy shit.

656
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:05,174
Mommy, what happened?

657
00:43:05,258 --> 00:43:07,384
- Stay upstairs. Stay upstairs.
- What happened?

658
00:43:07,469 --> 00:43:08,552
Don't come down here.

659
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:10,304
- There's glass on the floor. Stay there.
- Are you hurt?

660
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:15,309
I have no idea, I have no idea.

661
00:43:17,854 --> 00:43:20,939
Looks fine, right? It didn't even break.

662
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:23,817
That's good.

663
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:25,611
- What happened?
- It just fell. I didn't...

664
00:43:25,695 --> 00:43:27,112
What do you mean, what happened?
I was in there.

665
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:31,241
- Hi, Kristi.
- Hey.

666
00:43:31,326 --> 00:43:33,660
- Say hi to the camera.
- Hey.

667
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:35,621
- Can I join you guys?
- Sure.

668
00:43:35,705 --> 00:43:36,955
- I can?
- Yeah.

669
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,582
Okay, great.

670
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:40,250
I'm gonna set my camera here, okay?

671
00:43:40,335 --> 00:43:42,127
- Okay.
- Just keep it out of the way.

672
00:43:42,212 --> 00:43:44,671
Wait. Why are you filming this?

673
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:48,550
It's just like,
I'm testing out my, like, new camera

674
00:43:48,635 --> 00:43:51,261
and, you know, no reason.

675
00:43:51,346 --> 00:43:53,430
Don't sit there. That's Toby's spot.

676
00:43:53,515 --> 00:43:56,808
Sorry. Is Toby sitting there right now?

677
00:43:56,893 --> 00:43:58,185
Okay. Sorry.

678
00:43:58,269 --> 00:43:59,686
Sorry, Toby.

679
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:06,151
Does Teddy need help with his tea?
He looks thirsty.

680
00:44:06,236 --> 00:44:07,861
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Teddy.

681
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:09,821
Here. He can't reach 'em.

682
00:44:09,906 --> 00:44:11,031
Okay.

683
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:16,203
Wow. He was thirsty. See, I told you.

684
00:44:17,872 --> 00:44:19,748
And she keeps falling.

685
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:21,500
Poke.

686
00:44:21,584 --> 00:44:25,170
So, Kristi, what was the last thing
that Toby said to you?

687
00:44:25,713 --> 00:44:27,214
Like...

688
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:30,884
- Anything?
- Yeah.

689
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:32,761
- No?
- Secrets.

690
00:44:32,845 --> 00:44:35,764
Secrets. Regular stuff. In her sink?

691
00:44:35,848 --> 00:44:37,391
Yeah. Sorry.

692
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:39,184
That... Did you... Did you...

693
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:41,436
Did he say something just now?

694
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,898
No, I just put my hand on him.

695
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,818
And he didn't like that.

696
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:49,820
He doesn't like that, when you...

697
00:44:49,904 --> 00:44:51,238
No.

698
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:53,991
Sorry, Toby. It was a mistake, right?

699
00:44:54,075 --> 00:44:55,659
Yeah.

700
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,538
- What?
- Nothing.

701
00:44:59,622 --> 00:45:00,831
- What?
- Never mind.

702
00:45:00,915 --> 00:45:02,666
- What were you gonna say?
- Nothing.

703
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:03,834
It's okay, you can tell me.

704
00:45:06,254 --> 00:45:08,338
Kristi, why is Dennis's camera here?

705
00:45:08,423 --> 00:45:11,174
Because me and Toby
were having a little tea party

706
00:45:11,259 --> 00:45:12,426
and he was filming us.

707
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,595
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are, Kristi.

708
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:17,139
Only babies have imaginary friends.

709
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:20,017
He is real.

710
00:45:20,101 --> 00:45:22,436
Hey, Kristi! Kristi's such a baby! Baby!

711
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,729
Katie, stop it!

712
00:45:23,813 --> 00:45:24,938
Well, you're being a baby!

713
00:45:25,023 --> 00:45:26,064
Only babies have imaginary friends.

714
00:45:26,149 --> 00:45:28,525
No, I'm not! He's right in there.

715
00:45:28,901 --> 00:45:31,945
In there? Toby, come out!

716
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,156
Toby, come out!

717
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:37,951
Toby!

718
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,289
Okay, I'm gonna go in.

719
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:43,957
Katie, you shouldn't do that.

720
00:45:44,459 --> 00:45:46,001
Katie! Don't go in there.

721
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:49,713
- You shouldn't do that.
- Well, I am.

722
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Toby, come out.
Toby...
Katie.
Kristi! What are you doing?

723
00:46:00,683 --> 00:46:02,017
Open the door!

724
00:46:02,435 --> 00:46:03,894
You shouldn't do that.

725
00:46:04,312 --> 00:46:05,937
Kristi, open this door!

726
00:46:06,022 --> 00:46:07,272
- It's not me!
- Kristi!

727
00:46:07,357 --> 00:46:08,440
- Girls!
- Open the door!

728
00:46:08,524 --> 00:46:11,193
- What is this yelling? What is going on?
- I'm not doing that.

729
00:46:11,277 --> 00:46:13,111
Stop fighting right this second.

730
00:46:13,196 --> 00:46:14,237
Why's Dennis's camera on the floor?

731
00:46:14,322 --> 00:46:15,489
She locked me in there.

732
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:17,032
- Katie, you can't touch his stuff.
- Kristi, why...

733
00:46:17,325 --> 00:46:18,283
Stop fighting right this second.

734
00:46:18,368 --> 00:46:19,868
- Mom, she locked me in there!
- I don't want to hear it.

735
00:46:19,952 --> 00:46:21,578
- Come on, come on.
- Then who locked me in there?

736
00:46:21,663 --> 00:46:22,621
Toby did.

737
00:46:22,705 --> 00:46:24,247
Yeah, like Toby locked me in there.

738
00:46:46,896 --> 00:46:48,480
She's gonna be here any minute.

739
00:46:48,564 --> 00:46:50,190
See? There she is.

740
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:52,776
Mommy, Lisa's here!

741
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,444
Okay!

742
00:46:58,074 --> 00:47:01,076
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi! How are you?

743
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,536
Good.

744
00:47:03,496 --> 00:47:05,831
- I wanna show you something upstairs.
- Hi, Lisa.

745
00:47:06,165 --> 00:47:07,249
Wait, what are you showing me?

746
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:08,875
I got some new beads for my birthday.

747
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,253
Beads! Let's see 'em.

748
00:47:11,337 --> 00:47:13,046
Hi, Kristi. How are you?

749
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:14,172
Hey.

750
00:47:15,425 --> 00:47:16,591
What's that?

751
00:47:16,676 --> 00:47:18,135
Don't mind this.

752
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:20,679
You know Dennis and his cameras,
he just puts them...

753
00:47:20,763 --> 00:47:21,805
Just ignore it.

754
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:22,973
8:30 bedtime?

755
00:47:23,057 --> 00:47:24,516
No, no, no, 10:00.

756
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,934
- 8:30. Nice try.
- Mommy, please.

757
00:47:26,018 --> 00:47:27,060
9:30?

758
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:28,395
- 9:00.
- 9:45.

759
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:31,231
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, guys. Love you.

760
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:33,150
Look, it made a triangle.

761
00:47:38,114 --> 00:47:39,865
- You ready?
- Yeah.

762
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:41,908
- Good night, girls!
- Good night.

763
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:44,369
- See you later.
- Bye, Julie. Bye, Dennis.

764
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:51,543
Are you tired?

765
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:53,378
- Not really.
- No?

766
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:55,297
Can you tell us a story?

767
00:47:55,381 --> 00:47:58,049
Sure. What kind of story?

768
00:47:58,176 --> 00:47:59,468
A ghost story.

769
00:47:59,552 --> 00:48:01,887
Ghost story? With a ghost.

770
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:04,556
Okay, let's think.

771
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:11,563
I'm a ghost!

772
00:48:11,647 --> 00:48:13,857
Hello, Dennis! You found the ghost.

773
00:48:15,568 --> 00:48:16,985
Comin' to get you.

774
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:19,738
Got you!

775
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,413
- Good night, Lisa.
- Good night, sweetie.

776
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

777
00:49:21,133 --> 00:49:22,592
Hi, Dennis.

778
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

779
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

780
00:52:58,059 --> 00:52:59,476
- Hi.
- Hey!

781
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,643
Hi!

782
00:53:00,728 --> 00:53:03,146
- How'd it go?
- Fine, it was good.

783
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:05,148
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they were great.

784
00:53:05,232 --> 00:53:06,816
The girls were...
Give you any trouble, or...

785
00:53:06,901 --> 00:53:08,651
No, no, no, no, it was good.

786
00:53:08,736 --> 00:53:10,570
But my mom's meeting me,
so if I could just...

787
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,655
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, give her some money.

788
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:13,907
Here you go.

789
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:14,991
Thank you.

790
00:53:15,076 --> 00:53:16,076
You're sure everything was good?

791
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,160
Yeah, no. Thank you, guys.

792
00:53:17,244 --> 00:53:18,703
- Okay.
- Bye.

793
00:53:21,749 --> 00:53:24,250
Okay, bye. Thanks.

794
00:53:29,173 --> 00:53:30,173
I don't know.

795
00:53:30,257 --> 00:53:31,257
- That was weird.
- Yeah.

796
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:33,713
It's so high.

797
00:55:45,893 --> 00:55:47,101
Promise?

798
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:50,021
Okay.

799
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:16,839
What are you doing?

800
00:56:18,259 --> 00:56:20,510
- Nothing.
- Why are you up?

801
00:56:21,971 --> 00:56:23,263
Why are you up?

802
00:56:24,265 --> 00:56:25,265
Nothing.

803
00:56:29,353 --> 00:56:31,729
Kristi, go to bed. It's late.

804
00:56:41,907 --> 00:56:43,574
- Is that the babysitter?
- Yeah, that's Lisa.

805
00:56:43,659 --> 00:56:44,826
How come I never met her?

806
00:56:44,952 --> 00:56:45,994
I'll put in a good word.

807
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,996
- See the sheet?
- Yeah.

808
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,455
Watch this.

809
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:54,627
- Gone.
- Holy fuck.

810
00:56:56,588 --> 00:56:57,797
Am I... Am I right?

811
00:56:59,133 --> 00:57:00,174
Holy...

812
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,676
- Did you see that?
- ...fuck!

813
00:57:03,262 --> 00:57:06,431
I'm not crazy, right? I'm not crazy.

814
00:57:07,641 --> 00:57:09,183
That just happened.

815
00:57:09,685 --> 00:57:10,768
Holy!

816
00:57:10,853 --> 00:57:11,936
What the fuck is that?

817
00:57:12,021 --> 00:57:13,354
I don't know.

818
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:15,690
- What is that?
- I don't know.

819
00:57:15,774 --> 00:57:17,025
I'm telling you, it's...

820
00:57:17,151 --> 00:57:19,027
And she didn't say anything at all?

821
00:57:19,111 --> 00:57:21,029
She left the room, like...

822
00:57:21,155 --> 00:57:22,864
Did you show Julie?

823
00:57:22,948 --> 00:57:27,201
No, man. What, are you kidding?
She would flip out.

824
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:29,203
She would go nuts, and, you know,

825
00:57:29,329 --> 00:57:31,873
she'd make me take
the cameras down, and I can't do that.

826
00:57:31,957 --> 00:57:33,541
I really want to figure out
what this thing wants.

827
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:35,209
Got to keep taping this shit,
though, man.

828
00:57:35,335 --> 00:57:36,878
I know. I am.

829
00:57:36,962 --> 00:57:38,546
- You got to keep taping this shit.
- I know.

830
00:57:38,672 --> 00:57:40,131
She got blown in the face.

831
00:57:40,215 --> 00:57:41,674
Yeah, yeah.

832
00:59:11,431 --> 00:59:14,142
No.

833
00:59:15,644 --> 00:59:18,146
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

834
00:59:18,814 --> 00:59:20,481
I'm going to bed.

835
00:59:45,007 --> 00:59:46,090
What the...

836
00:59:55,267 --> 00:59:56,851
What the fuck?

837
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,360
Hey, how's she feeling?

838
01:00:06,486 --> 01:00:09,697
We need to go to the doctor
'cause she's burning up.

839
01:00:09,823 --> 01:00:11,324
Oh, no.

840
01:00:12,034 --> 01:00:13,367
- Yeah, she's really...
- She's really that bad?

841
01:00:13,493 --> 01:00:14,702
- Yeah, it's bad.
- All right.

842
01:00:14,828 --> 01:00:15,953
It's like, I've taken it a couple times.

843
01:00:16,038 --> 01:00:17,705
Do you want me to go with you or...

844
01:00:17,831 --> 01:00:19,957
Well, I mean, I don't know.
Who's gonna watch Katie?

845
01:00:20,042 --> 01:00:21,167
I can call Randy.

846
01:00:26,715 --> 01:00:27,882
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey.

847
01:00:28,008 --> 01:00:29,383
- Thanks for coming over.
- No problemo.

848
01:00:29,509 --> 01:00:30,968
- Hi, Randy.
- Hi!

849
01:00:31,053 --> 01:00:32,136
Randy, thank you so much.

850
01:00:32,221 --> 01:00:33,971
We're gonna be
at the hospital for a little bit.

851
01:00:34,056 --> 01:00:35,139
Okay.

852
01:00:35,224 --> 01:00:36,474
Anything you guys want...

853
01:00:36,558 --> 01:00:38,059
- I know where everything is.
- Okay, great.

854
01:00:38,185 --> 01:00:39,310
- Yeah.
- All right.

855
01:00:39,394 --> 01:00:40,478
Bye! Love you. Bye, Kristi!

856
01:00:40,562 --> 01:00:42,230
You have everything?
You have papers and insurance?

857
01:00:42,314 --> 01:00:43,397
Yeah, I have it.

858
01:00:43,482 --> 01:00:44,565
- Thanks a lot.
- Love you. Bye.

859
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,317
- I'll lock the door.
- Okay, thanks.

860
01:00:46,401 --> 01:00:47,401
- Thanks again.
- I'll lock it.

861
01:00:47,527 --> 01:00:49,654
All right, be good, Katie. See you.

862
01:00:52,532 --> 01:00:54,575
- Hey, hey.
- Hi.

863
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,910
So what's wrong with Kristi?

864
01:00:56,036 --> 01:00:57,995
It's like a really high fever
or something like that.

865
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,498
Is it contagious?

866
01:01:00,582 --> 01:01:02,416
I don't think so. I haven't gotten sick.

867
01:01:02,542 --> 01:01:03,918
Okay, good.

868
01:01:07,422 --> 01:01:09,173
What do you want to do?

869
01:01:09,258 --> 01:01:10,758
Can we play Bloody Mary?

870
01:01:10,842 --> 01:01:13,010
I have no idea what you're talking about.

871
01:01:13,095 --> 01:01:14,178
Seriously?

872
01:01:14,263 --> 01:01:16,264
I really don't think
this is a good idea, Katie.

873
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:17,848
You made a promise.
You have to do it.

874
01:01:17,933 --> 01:01:19,934
- Can't we just play, like, doll house...
- Get the camera!

875
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:21,769
...or somethin'?

876
01:01:21,895 --> 01:01:24,230
Sorry, Dennis. Not my idea.

877
01:01:25,399 --> 01:01:26,691
Come on.

878
01:01:26,775 --> 01:01:28,276
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

879
01:01:28,402 --> 01:01:30,111
So you say, "Bloody Mary" three times.

880
01:01:30,195 --> 01:01:31,696
And then you wait a little bit

881
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,030
and then you turn the lights back on

882
01:01:33,115 --> 01:01:34,615
and then you're supposed
to see her body in the mirror

883
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,866
and she's gonna try to kill you.

884
01:01:35,951 --> 01:01:37,868
Try and kill you. Good game.

885
01:01:37,953 --> 01:01:39,036
Yep.

886
01:01:39,371 --> 01:01:40,454
I don't know why you wanna play this.

887
01:01:40,539 --> 01:01:42,206
One of us is gonna be dead
by the end of it.

888
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:44,125
I guess it's a one-time game.
Okay, let's do it.

889
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:52,800
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.

890
01:02:00,642 --> 01:02:01,934
Randy!

891
01:02:02,644 --> 01:02:04,145
Nothing happened.

892
01:02:04,271 --> 01:02:05,646
You turned the light on too soon.

893
01:02:05,772 --> 01:02:06,981
Come on, Katie. This is stupid.

894
01:02:07,065 --> 01:02:09,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't leave!

895
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:12,153
Let's just go play doll house
or something.

896
01:02:12,237 --> 01:02:13,571
No, you didn't do it right.

897
01:02:13,655 --> 01:02:14,822
What did I not do right?

898
01:02:14,906 --> 01:02:17,074
You need to keep the light off longer.

899
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:18,826
Okay. Okay.

900
01:02:18,952 --> 01:02:20,995
All right. You wanna play Bloody Mary?

901
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:22,997
- Let's play Bloody Mary.
- Okay, ready?

902
01:02:23,081 --> 01:02:24,498
You're not gonna
see anybody play Bloody Mary

903
01:02:24,624 --> 01:02:27,126
like I'm about to play Bloody Mary.

904
01:02:28,754 --> 01:02:35,343
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.

905
01:02:45,437 --> 01:02:47,271
Okay, can I turn it on now?

906
01:02:47,814 --> 01:02:49,690
- Quiet.
- Sorry. Sorry.

907
01:02:54,154 --> 01:02:55,821
How about now?

908
01:02:57,991 --> 01:02:59,116
Wait, wait.

909
01:02:59,201 --> 01:03:01,494
- What?
- Did you hear that?

910
01:03:04,706 --> 01:03:05,873
What was that?

911
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I know. I heard it, too.

912
01:03:13,715 --> 01:03:15,007
Holy shit!

913
01:03:17,344 --> 01:03:19,303
- Oh, my...
- Are you okay?

914
01:03:19,388 --> 01:03:21,138
Huh?

915
01:03:21,223 --> 01:03:22,306
Are you okay?

916
01:03:22,391 --> 01:03:23,474
Yeah.

917
01:03:23,558 --> 01:03:25,476
- Does it hurt?
- No.

918
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,020
I just scratched myself or something.

919
01:03:29,898 --> 01:03:30,981
Did you hear that?

920
01:03:31,066 --> 01:03:32,149
Yeah.

921
01:03:32,901 --> 01:03:34,360
It's okay. Nothing...

922
01:03:35,737 --> 01:03:37,488
Close the door. It's okay. It's all right.

923
01:03:37,864 --> 01:03:38,906
It's all right. It's okay.

924
01:03:39,032 --> 01:03:41,575
I don't want to die! Randy, I'm scared!

925
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:45,079
Holy shit! It's okay!

926
01:03:45,163 --> 01:03:47,164
Randy, I'm scared!

927
01:03:47,249 --> 01:03:48,249
Holy fuck!

928
01:03:56,341 --> 01:03:59,343
You okay? You okay?

929
01:03:59,428 --> 01:04:00,511
Oh, my God.

930
01:04:00,595 --> 01:04:01,846
It's all right.

931
01:04:02,055 --> 01:04:04,265
Dear God. Please, God.

932
01:04:04,349 --> 01:04:05,850
Please, God, be with me.

933
01:04:07,185 --> 01:04:09,270
It's okay! It's okay!

934
01:04:09,396 --> 01:04:10,855
I don't want to play this.

935
01:04:10,939 --> 01:04:12,273
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

936
01:04:12,357 --> 01:04:14,859
I'm fine. I'm fine.

937
01:04:14,943 --> 01:04:16,110
Stay here.

938
01:04:16,236 --> 01:04:17,778
I don't wanna play anymore.

939
01:04:17,863 --> 01:04:19,238
It's okay, it's okay.

940
01:04:23,285 --> 01:04:24,785
It's okay.

941
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

942
01:04:38,633 --> 01:04:40,759
Holy fuck!

943
01:04:43,221 --> 01:04:44,430
Okay.

944
01:04:44,556 --> 01:04:46,056
- Nothing happened.
- You okay?

945
01:04:46,141 --> 01:04:47,308
Nothing. You're fine.

946
01:04:47,434 --> 01:04:48,893
- I wanna get out of here.
- It's okay, all right.

947
01:04:48,977 --> 01:04:51,145
We're gonna get out of here.

948
01:04:51,271 --> 01:04:53,147
Come on, Randy! Come on, Randy!

949
01:04:54,983 --> 01:04:56,484
Stay here.

950
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,780
Dear Lord, be with me,
please, be with me.

951
01:05:22,761 --> 01:05:25,429
- Randy, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
- It's okay.

952
01:05:25,514 --> 01:05:27,097
- Come here, come here.
- I'm sorry!

953
01:05:27,182 --> 01:05:28,599
It's okay. Huh?

954
01:05:28,683 --> 01:05:30,851
- Please, please, don't tell.
- It's okay, it's just like an earthquake.

955
01:05:30,936 --> 01:05:32,645
I'm not gonna tell. I'm not gonna tell.

956
01:05:33,021 --> 01:05:34,188
It's all right. It's okay.

957
01:05:34,272 --> 01:05:35,356
I wanna go downstairs!

958
01:05:35,482 --> 01:05:36,774
Yeah, let's go downstairs.

959
01:05:36,858 --> 01:05:38,192
Fuck.

960
01:05:50,664 --> 01:05:53,374
Randy, Randy,
where are you going, man? Relax.

961
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:54,875
Randy, Randy, take it easy.

962
01:05:55,001 --> 01:05:57,711
Randy. What... What are you doing?

963
01:05:57,837 --> 01:06:00,631
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm getting all my stuff.

964
01:06:00,715 --> 01:06:02,383
What... What are you
getting your stuff for, man?

965
01:06:02,509 --> 01:06:03,634
- Relax. Sit down.
- Dennis.

966
01:06:03,718 --> 01:06:05,302
Get the camera out of my face.

967
01:06:05,387 --> 01:06:08,222
I told you,
I felt something in the room with us

968
01:06:08,348 --> 01:06:10,474
and then I felt a claw
dig into my side, okay?

969
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,559
Okay, okay.
When you say "something..."

970
01:06:11,685 --> 01:06:12,726
Great interview.

971
01:06:12,811 --> 01:06:14,728
- No, Dennis, I'm done. Fuck.
- When you say...

972
01:06:14,813 --> 01:06:16,397
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home!

973
01:06:16,523 --> 01:06:18,399
Look at the fuckin' books.
This isn't, you know,

974
01:06:18,525 --> 01:06:20,568
Casper, the fuckin' friendly ghost
you're chasing, man.

975
01:06:20,694 --> 01:06:22,236
- I'm sorry you got hurt.
- This thing is dangerous!

976
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,405
- I'm sorry you got hurt, okay?
- Jesus fucking Christ!

977
01:06:24,531 --> 01:06:27,408
I'm sorry, but... What are you
gonna do? You're just gonna quit?

978
01:06:27,534 --> 01:06:29,076
You're acting ridiculous. Relax!

979
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:30,327
Dennis, no, you're acting ridiculous

980
01:06:30,412 --> 01:06:31,495
if you're not gonna get the fuck out.

981
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,581
You have to tell Julie, okay?

982
01:06:33,707 --> 01:06:36,250
Just watch the fucking tape, Dennis!

983
01:07:00,775 --> 01:07:02,776
- What's up?
- Hey.

984
01:07:02,902 --> 01:07:04,194
What?

985
01:07:04,279 --> 01:07:07,281
I need to talk to you.

986
01:07:07,365 --> 01:07:09,366
- Okay.
- All right, sit down.

987
01:07:10,243 --> 01:07:13,120
Here. Sit down, Jule.
Okay, where do I begin?

988
01:07:13,204 --> 01:07:15,122
...from the '30s. Look at the necklaces.

989
01:07:15,206 --> 01:07:18,042
That's crazy. Yeah?

990
01:07:18,752 --> 01:07:20,210
It's the same symbol.

991
01:07:20,295 --> 01:07:22,963
Isn't that the same symbol
from the girls' room?

992
01:07:23,048 --> 01:07:25,633
All right? These...
These women, they were...

993
01:07:25,717 --> 01:07:27,384
- Oh, my God.
- ...part of a coven.

994
01:07:27,469 --> 01:07:29,136
You're really something.

995
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,305
I... I... I really need to...
To tell you this, okay?

996
01:07:31,431 --> 01:07:32,931
Kristi!

997
01:07:34,434 --> 01:07:36,101
You'd better run!

998
01:07:45,236 --> 01:07:46,403
You sound crazy. Do you know that?

999
01:07:46,488 --> 01:07:47,488
Hang on a second, all right?

1000
01:07:47,614 --> 01:07:48,822
Do you know how crazy
you're starting to sound?

1001
01:07:48,948 --> 01:07:50,240
Would you just give me
a second to explain?

1002
01:07:50,325 --> 01:07:51,659
They would have these ceremonies

1003
01:07:51,785 --> 01:07:53,994
and they would wait till the girls
were old enough to get pregnant

1004
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,330
and then they would... They would...
They would take their sons.

1005
01:07:56,456 --> 01:07:57,498
Right.

1006
01:07:57,582 --> 01:07:59,750
And then they would brainwash them
and they didn't remember a thing.

1007
01:07:59,834 --> 01:08:01,335
That explains it.
Dennis, I'm not listening to...

1008
01:08:01,461 --> 01:08:02,670
Mom?

1009
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1010
01:08:17,519 --> 01:08:18,852
- I need to show you something.
- It's all you do!

1011
01:08:18,978 --> 01:08:20,020
There's shit...

1012
01:08:20,105 --> 01:08:21,188
You don't even spend
any time with us anymore.

1013
01:08:21,272 --> 01:08:22,856
You just sit here
and play with this shit all day long.

1014
01:08:22,982 --> 01:08:24,692
- Could you just wait one second?
- It's like you're obsessed!

1015
01:08:24,818 --> 01:08:26,026
Just wait one second.
I need to show you this, okay?

1016
01:08:26,152 --> 01:08:27,194
No, I can't. I can't wait.

1017
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,362
- No, no, no...
- I can't wait! I can't!

1018
01:08:28,446 --> 01:08:29,446
- Why not?
- Because...

1019
01:08:29,531 --> 01:08:30,614
Because Kristi's upset all the time...

1020
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:32,199
- Mommy?
- What the fuck? I don't...

1021
01:08:32,325 --> 01:08:33,867
What? What? What?

1022
01:08:33,952 --> 01:08:35,452
Toby pulled my hair.

1023
01:08:35,537 --> 01:08:36,620
- What happened?
- Who?

1024
01:08:36,705 --> 01:08:38,372
Toby pulled my hair.

1025
01:08:38,456 --> 01:08:39,540
This is your fault.

1026
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:41,625
Okay? This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

1027
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:43,502
Hey... I didn't...

1028
01:08:45,213 --> 01:08:47,715
No more cameras.
No more ghosts. This ends tomorrow.

1029
01:08:47,799 --> 01:08:50,676
Julie, I...
You gotta watch the fucking tape.

1030
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:52,339
Kristi.

1031
01:10:53,091 --> 01:10:54,466
Wake up!

1032
01:10:57,595 --> 01:10:59,680
Katie, go back to sleep.

1033
01:11:03,309 --> 01:11:04,518
What was that?

1034
01:11:12,652 --> 01:11:14,194
What's happening?

1035
01:11:17,031 --> 01:11:18,323
Kristi!

1036
01:11:18,992 --> 01:11:20,325
Toby's here.

1037
01:11:23,496 --> 01:11:26,790
I'm scared! Mom! Mommy!

1038
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:28,125
- Mommy!
- Stop screaming!

1039
01:11:28,209 --> 01:11:30,460
It's okay! Just ignore it!

1040
01:11:30,712 --> 01:11:32,212
Just ignore it!

1041
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1042
01:11:40,889 --> 01:11:42,014
Mom!

1043
01:11:46,853 --> 01:11:47,978
Kristi!

1044
01:11:48,897 --> 01:11:51,064
Kristi, help me!

1045
01:11:52,066 --> 01:11:53,901
Kristi!
Please... Please... Please help me!

1046
01:11:59,574 --> 01:12:00,657
Katie!

1047
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:04,494
Let her go! Let her go!

1048
01:12:05,413 --> 01:12:08,165
Toby, stop! Stop, Toby!

1049
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,003
I'll do it.

1050
01:12:13,421 --> 01:12:14,671
Just let her go!

1051
01:12:24,891 --> 01:12:27,351
I'm scared. I want Mommy!

1052
01:12:39,113 --> 01:12:40,197
...to Grandma's house.

1053
01:12:40,281 --> 01:12:41,448
No, we're not going
to Grandma's house, okay?

1054
01:12:41,574 --> 01:12:42,616
Why?

1055
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,534
We're not going to Grandma's
because there's no Toby, sweetie.

1056
01:12:44,619 --> 01:12:46,620
- Yes, there...
- There's no Toby and there's no ghost.

1057
01:12:46,746 --> 01:12:48,372
Hey, don't run away from me.

1058
01:12:48,456 --> 01:12:51,458
Hey. There's no ghost
and that's the end of it.

1059
01:12:51,542 --> 01:12:53,961
I don't want to hear any more
of this talk, okay?

1060
01:12:54,045 --> 01:12:55,128
Okay?

1061
01:13:03,888 --> 01:13:05,973
- What'd she say?
- She said no.

1062
01:13:06,391 --> 01:13:09,142
No. No. Mom, we're not coming over.

1063
01:13:10,103 --> 01:13:12,312
Okay? We're staying right here.

1064
01:13:14,273 --> 01:13:17,067
Because I need
to get things back to normal.

1065
01:13:18,611 --> 01:13:20,487
All right, Mom, I gotta go.
Someone's at the door, okay?

1066
01:13:20,571 --> 01:13:22,823
I'll call you back. Yeah, okay.

1067
01:13:34,419 --> 01:13:39,256
Hello?

1068
01:13:40,091 --> 01:13:41,258
Weird.

1069
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

1070
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,323
Dennis!

1071
01:14:05,408 --> 01:14:08,452
Dennis! Dennis, get the girls!
We're getting out of here!

1072
01:14:11,622 --> 01:14:15,292
Girls, wake up, we're here.
Wake up. We're here.

1073
01:14:17,211 --> 01:14:18,462
Yay, we're here.

1074
01:14:18,546 --> 01:14:19,755
There's Grandma.

1075
01:14:19,839 --> 01:14:21,798
Mommy, I'm tired.

1076
01:14:27,305 --> 01:14:28,430
Go park by the garage.

1077
01:14:35,813 --> 01:14:37,105
Oh, God.

1078
01:14:38,316 --> 01:14:39,858
Are you okay?

1079
01:14:40,193 --> 01:14:41,485
- Come on.
- Let's go, guys.

1080
01:14:41,569 --> 01:14:44,404
Hi, honey. Come on, go.
You go with your mom.

1081
01:14:44,489 --> 01:14:47,574
I've got your sister. Come on. Come on.

1082
01:14:47,658 --> 01:14:48,825
Mommy.

1083
01:14:50,328 --> 01:14:52,537
Sleepy girl is what she is.

1084
01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:55,165
Go on in the house. I've got apple pie

1085
01:14:55,666 --> 01:14:59,294
and I've got... You want water, I know.

1086
01:14:59,378 --> 01:15:00,420
How're we doing?

1087
01:15:00,505 --> 01:15:01,838
Put the camera down
and come and eat some pie.

1088
01:15:01,923 --> 01:15:02,964
- I'm fine.
- Come on.

1089
01:15:03,049 --> 01:15:04,424
It makes me feel better to do something.

1090
01:15:04,509 --> 01:15:06,093
- Okay. Okay.
- Feel useful.

1091
01:15:06,177 --> 01:15:07,219
Are you okay?

1092
01:15:07,303 --> 01:15:08,887
- How's it going, kiddo?
- What is going on?

1093
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:10,263
- Good.
- How you feeling?

1094
01:15:10,348 --> 01:15:13,767
...not talk about it right now.
We can talk about it when...

1095
01:15:13,851 --> 01:15:15,435
Just... Let's just drop it.

1096
01:15:21,025 --> 01:15:23,068
- Hey, Kristi?
- What?

1097
01:15:23,152 --> 01:15:26,530
Don't touch the painting, okay?
It's okay, I'm not mad.

1098
01:15:27,365 --> 01:15:28,907
Do you like it?

1099
01:15:31,077 --> 01:15:32,244
What's the matter?

1100
01:15:32,328 --> 01:15:34,871
Kristi! Come and get your pie!

1101
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:50,303
Hey, guys.

1102
01:15:51,472 --> 01:15:52,931
What's going on?
You playing some dress-up?

1103
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:55,100
Doesn't she make a beautiful bride?

1104
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:56,726
- Very.
- Do you want to put this on her?

1105
01:15:56,811 --> 01:15:57,853
Beautiful.

1106
01:15:58,187 --> 01:15:59,437
Try that.

1107
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,984
So, who's the lucky guy?

1108
01:16:04,068 --> 01:16:05,152
Toby.

1109
01:16:05,236 --> 01:16:06,278
Wait. What did she say?

1110
01:16:06,362 --> 01:16:08,071
- Let's go. It's bedtime, girls. Let's go.
- Just having fun.

1111
01:16:08,156 --> 01:16:09,197
- Julie...
- Mom.

1112
01:16:09,282 --> 01:16:11,366
Come on. I don't want to hear
Toby's name ever again. Okay?

1113
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:12,492
Julie, it's just pretend.

1114
01:16:12,577 --> 01:16:13,618
That's it. He's done.
He's not in our lives.

1115
01:16:13,703 --> 01:16:14,744
- He's real. Toby is...
- Let's go.

1116
01:16:14,829 --> 01:16:15,871
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Kristi...

1117
01:16:15,997 --> 01:16:17,038
Can you take them to bed, please?
Let's go.

1118
01:16:17,123 --> 01:16:18,206
Come on, sweetheart.

1119
01:16:18,291 --> 01:16:19,332
Take Grandma's stuff off
and let's go to bed.

1120
01:16:19,417 --> 01:16:21,042
Dennis and I are gonna be
right next door, okay?

1121
01:16:21,127 --> 01:16:22,586
We're gonna leave
a light on and everything,

1122
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:25,046
so you can find us,
and everything's gonna be...

1123
01:16:25,131 --> 01:16:27,048
Gonna be fine, okay?
I love you so much.

1124
01:16:27,133 --> 01:16:28,049
Love you.

1125
01:16:28,134 --> 01:16:29,134
- Good night, guys.
- I love you so much.

1126
01:16:46,986 --> 01:16:49,821
When are you gonna stop taping us?

1127
01:16:49,906 --> 01:16:52,032
Not until this thing's over.

1128
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:01,917
When's your mom
gonna let us sleep in the same bed?

1129
01:17:03,711 --> 01:17:06,796
I can't stop thinking about it. I can't.

1130
01:17:06,881 --> 01:17:08,089
I know.

1131
01:17:09,383 --> 01:17:12,344
Just close your eyes
and try to get to sleep.

1132
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:15,305
Come here.

1133
01:17:16,641 --> 01:17:19,309
We can share a pillow, too. That's fine.

1134
01:18:12,571 --> 01:18:16,533
Julie.

1135
01:18:20,121 --> 01:18:21,705
Do you hear that?

1136
01:18:21,789 --> 01:18:23,206
Like cars?

1137
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,293
- Sorry...
- It's my mom.

1138
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:31,047
She's always up at night.
She can't sleep.

1139
01:18:33,259 --> 01:18:35,635
Oh, my God, she's so loud.

1140
01:18:36,804 --> 01:18:38,680
Do you want me to go check on her?

1141
01:18:38,764 --> 01:18:41,933
She's gonna wake the girls up.
I'll be right back.

1142
01:19:05,249 --> 01:19:07,292
Julie?

1143
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:37,447
Julie!

1144
01:20:11,148 --> 01:20:22,951
Girls?

1145
01:20:32,086 --> 01:20:33,253
Julie?

1146
01:20:37,508 --> 01:20:38,883
Hey, Julie!

1147
01:21:18,257 --> 01:21:19,424
Hello?

1148
01:21:30,603 --> 01:21:32,061
What the fuck?

1149
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:37,358
Julie?

1150
01:21:40,237 --> 01:21:41,362
Lois?

1151
01:22:00,257 --> 01:22:01,382
What?

1152
01:22:13,604 --> 01:22:15,104
What the fuck?

1153
01:22:19,068 --> 01:22:20,235
Julie!

1154
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1155
01:23:18,043 --> 01:23:20,253
What the fuck?

1156
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:28,678
Fuck. Oh, my God.

1157
01:23:32,808 --> 01:23:33,975
Julie!

1158
01:23:46,989 --> 01:23:48,156
Julie?

1159
01:23:50,951 --> 01:23:52,410
What's wrong?

1160
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1161
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:09,594
Fuck. Fuck.

1162
01:24:09,678 --> 01:24:10,845
Julie?

1163
01:24:11,805 --> 01:24:13,389
Get up.

1164
01:24:14,558 --> 01:24:15,933
Mommy?

1165
01:24:19,021 --> 01:24:20,813
Oh, Kristi! No, Kristi!

1166
01:24:20,898 --> 01:24:23,358
- Dennis?
- Come here, come on. Let's go, Kristi.

1167
01:24:23,442 --> 01:24:25,443
What happened to Mommy?
Is she okay?

1168
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:28,196
Oh, shit. Come here.
Go, go.

1169
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,739
Dennis, I'm scared.

1170
01:24:29,823 --> 01:24:30,948
It's okay. No, Kristi, don't talk.

1171
01:24:31,033 --> 01:24:32,200
Is Mommy okay?

1172
01:24:32,284 --> 01:24:33,618
Quiet, okay?

1173
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:36,371
Be quiet.
Just don't, okay? Just quiet, okay?

1174
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:44,337
It's okay.

1175
01:24:56,058 --> 01:24:58,768
Kristi, please, please, be quiet.

1176
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,651
I'm gonna go check, okay?

1177
01:25:06,735 --> 01:25:08,236
Stay here.

1178
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1179
01:25:15,703 --> 01:25:16,828
Come on, Kristi.

1180
01:25:16,912 --> 01:25:17,995
What was that?

1181
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,456
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

1182
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:33,386
Come on, let's go.

1183
01:25:33,470 --> 01:25:35,221
I'm scared.

1184
01:25:36,432 --> 01:25:37,765
We're gonna get out of here.

1185
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:40,643
Up. Okay.

1186
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,399
We're gonna be okay.

1187
01:25:46,483 --> 01:25:48,735
I don't know.

1188
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:53,781
Katie!

1189
01:25:53,866 --> 01:25:55,908
Katie, get away from there!

1190
01:25:56,785 --> 01:25:58,369
Kristi, listen to me,
stay right here, okay?

1191
01:25:58,454 --> 01:26:00,121
Don't move, okay?

1192
01:26:01,415 --> 01:26:18,931
Katie?

1193
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

1194
01:28:06,498 --> 01:28:07,999
Come on, Toby.

1195
01:28:12,212 --> 01:28:14,088
Let's get ready.
