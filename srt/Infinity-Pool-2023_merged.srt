1
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:05,132
<i>Did you just say you
can't feed yourself</i>

2
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,367
<i>with white-sand brain death?</i>

3
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,606
<i>What?</i>

4
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,210
<i>You said you can't feed yourself</i>

5
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,614
<i>with white-sand brain death.</i>

6
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:26,854
<i>What does that mean?
I didn't say that.</i>

7
00:01:26,888 --> 00:01:31,859
<i>You did. Maybe you
were still asleep.</i>

8
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:37,832
<i>You know what, I asked
if you wanted breakfast.</i>

9
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:41,569
<i>If we should get up
and get some breakfast.</i>

10
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,236
<i>But I heard you...</i>

11
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,809
<i>Why are we here?</i>

12
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:52,513
<i>It isn't helping. You're
so frozen these days</i>

13
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:56,784
<i>I can't even tell if
you're sleeping or awake.</i>

14
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:57,885
<i>Hey, come here.</i>

15
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,253
<i>No. Let's get breakfast.</i>

16
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,656
<i>No, forget breakfast.</i>

17
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:05,793
<i>No, no, I don't want
to miss the buffet.</i>

18
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:14,769
Oh.

19
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,609
Come on. Maybe we can
catch the omelet chef.

20
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,831
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen.

21
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:52,700
May I have your attention
for a moment, please?

22
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:53,901
As some of you may know,

23
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:55,603
we are approaching
the rainy season

24
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,505
here in Li Tolqa.

25
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:00,508
For the locals, this period
before the storms come

26
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,611
is known as "Umbramaq,"
or "The Summoning."

27
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,646
It is celebrated with
traditional music,

28
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,416
and feasting, and of
course, good company.

29
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,419
So, this morning, I would
like to welcome you all

30
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:17,692
to Umbramaq and to anoint you
with the "fet yegga" pigment

31
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:20,795
in the colors of the
coast, because it signifies

32
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,597
that we are all
bound by friendship

33
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,000
and we are closing out
the season together.

34
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,836
Oh, and if any of you would
like to purchase "ekki" masks,

35
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,572
they are still available
at the gift shop.

36
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,373
Thank you! Thank you.

37
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,010
Thank you. Thank you.

38
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,702
Where are we?

39
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:04,739
This was your idea, remember?

40
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,373
Feeling inspired yet?

41
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:16,751
Oh, thank you. You didn't
say you were hungry.

42
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,451
There's a boat tour

43
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,956
of the Tra-kla Island
formations this afternoon.

44
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,624
I was thinking we
could go on that,

45
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:27,695
and make reservations
in town for dinner.

46
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,697
We could try the Chinese place.

47
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,634
I don't think I'd survive
another dinner in town.

48
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,736
Even the idea of it.

49
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,540
Does anyone think
it's a real town?

50
00:05:39,574 --> 00:05:41,709
Why would they have
a Chinese place?

51
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:50,918
Is it okay if I go? I'll
meet you on the beach.

52
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:53,621
Yeah, sure.

53
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:54,889
Okay.

54
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:21,015
Oh, shit.

55
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,786
What's going on?

56
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,955
Someone's making a statement.

57
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:29,991
One of the locals, I'd guess.

58
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:35,529
What do you think
he's trying to say?

59
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,107
He's saying that he
wants to put a long knife

60
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,466
right through here.

61
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,068
And after you die,
he'll hang your body

62
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:45,606
at the airport to scare
off the other tourists.

63
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,041
Seems a bit extreme.

64
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,079
The Li Tolqans are a
melodramatic people.

65
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,689
I loved your book.

66
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,758
Sorry?

67
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:07,194
You're James Foster.
I loved your book.

68
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,765
Sorry, is that gauche?

69
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:11,632
I don't mean to put
you on the spot.

70
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,700
Oh, no.

71
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,503
No... Thank you. Thank you.

72
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:18,673
It's just, um, not a lot
of people read my book.

73
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,808
I'm Gabi Bauer.

74
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,176
Um, I'm James Foster.

75
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,476
James Foster.

76
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,013
Alban.

77
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,518
This is James Foster.

78
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:31,862
Hi, nice to meet
you. Alban Bauer.

79
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,154
Alban. Pleasure.

80
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,155
He wrote a book that I love.

81
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,890
<i>The Variable Sheath.</i>

82
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,559
Oh. Oh, yeah, I remember.

83
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:39,636
I thought it was brilliant.

84
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,928
Yes.

85
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:43,030
James, do you think
I could convince you

86
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:45,666
to join us for
dinner this evening?

87
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,077
I've been seeing you
around the resort

88
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:50,104
for a few days now and I
would love to get to know you.

89
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,007
We have a reservation
tonight at Yangs.

90
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,188
Yeah, it was a good, kind of...

91
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,557
learning experience,
I would say.

92
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,058
All right.

93
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:13,794
Is there anything
else I can get you?

94
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:15,663
Um, that's all, I think.

95
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,798
All right, everyone,
please have a great meal.

96
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,242
- Thank you.
- And let me know anytime

97
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:23,604
if I can make your experience
even more enjoyable.

98
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,941
Interesting guy.

99
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,676
Yes.

100
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,745
This is what is labeled
in the resort guide

101
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,814
as a multicultural
dining experience.

102
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:37,151
Well, it certainly
is an experience.

103
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:40,087
So, Alban, what is it
you do for a living?

104
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:42,823
Oh, architecture, but
I've mostly retired.

105
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:46,193
Now I run a journal out of
Los Angeles called <i>Glass Pane.</i>

106
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:47,561
You're French?

107
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:50,097
Mm, oh, no. Swiss
first, from Geneva.

108
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:52,900
Then Paris, then LA.

109
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,736
I'm from London
first, then Paris.

110
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,980
- We met there.
- That's how we met.

111
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,706
Oh.

112
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,609
But I couldn't get work there,
so I made Alban move with me.

113
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,778
And what do you do?

114
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:07,048
Well, I'm an actress, of course.

115
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,917
- Oh, really?
- She's great.

116
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,786
- For commercials.
- Okay.

117
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,654
I have a contract
with an LA company.

118
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,056
They've been grooming me.

119
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:18,726
I specialize in
failing naturally.

120
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,029
What does that mean?
"Failing naturally"?

121
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:26,801
Finding a natural-seeming way
to fail at any given task.

122
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,245
In each of the
commercials that I'm in,

123
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:31,238
I'm the one who simply can't
go on without the product.

124
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:34,642
It's ridiculous for me
to not have the product.

125
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,843
Okay.

126
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,244
- Show them.
- No.

127
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:39,080
- No, you should.
- Yeah.

128
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:40,181
Please.

129
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:41,182
You wanna...? Do
you wanna see it?

130
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:42,249
I wanna see. I wanna see.

131
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:43,684
Here.

132
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,822
She's amazing.

133
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,944
I just... I...

134
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,279
I can't.

135
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:16,417
How... how can I...
It's impossible.

136
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,727
No one can cut
bread with a knife.

137
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:18,719
- No one.
- No.

138
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,322
No one. I need the BunChop.

139
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:22,890
Yeah.

140
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,259
James, don't you
need the BunChop?

141
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,293
Yeah, you need it.

142
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:27,394
Clearly.

143
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:29,063
And see, each act of failure

144
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,165
is a sort of mental
and physical puzzle.

145
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:40,841
You know, I've been waiting
six years for your second book.

146
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,977
That's true.

147
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,345
Is it coming out soon?

148
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:53,420
We'll... We'll see.

149
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:00,461
Did I say something wrong?

150
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,696
Oh, no, no. It's just he...
He hasn't been writing.

151
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,697
No, no.

152
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:06,400
No. I'm... I'm working on it.

153
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,904
Hm, writer's block?

154
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:12,840
Well, I'm starting to think it
might be the lack of talent.

155
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,275
- No. No.
- No.

156
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:17,077
Don't say that. Please.

157
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:21,048
I actually came here
looking for inspiration.

158
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:26,120
To a... To a resort.
It's quite pathetic.

159
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,422
So, what do you
do for money then?

160
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,157
Do you teach, or?

161
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:31,959
He married rich.

162
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,461
That's a good one.

163
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:36,997
Well, it's good for an artist
to have a patron, isn't it?

164
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,399
- Yes... Yeah.
- Oh, sure.

165
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,210
I'm in danger of becoming
a charitable organization

166
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:44,004
at this point.

167
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,374
What's wrong?

168
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:54,975
No, I just...

169
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,453
I don't understand
why we're doing this.

170
00:12:56,477 --> 00:12:58,879
We barely know these people.

171
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,090
We spent last night with them.

172
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:01,882
You know what I mean.

173
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,184
We're not supposed to
leave the resort strip.

174
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:06,387
It's a poor country. I
know it's not their fault,

175
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,888
but they have a high crime rate,

176
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,525
and the guide says
they target foreigners.

177
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:12,293
Well, maybe a little
therapeutic mugging

178
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:13,861
could fix my back.

179
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:18,399
Come on.

180
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:22,202
I'm sure it's safe if
the Bauers are going.

181
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:25,205
They come here every year.

182
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:28,475
You're just happy you
found your fan club.

183
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,478
Well, Em, you knew it
had to be somewhere.

184
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:34,616
All right? It's one day.

185
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:38,986
Let's mix things up
a bit. It'll be fun.

186
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:44,258
And then now you have to
be especially careful...

187
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:47,227
Hi!

188
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,262
- Hi.
- Hi.

189
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,597
You made it.

190
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:51,498
- Yeah.
- How are you?

191
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,600
- Good.
- Good. Good.

192
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:53,967
Are you well? You slept well?

193
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,169
- Yeah.
- Nice to see you.

194
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:57,404
This is Mr. Thresh.

195
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:00,207
He's been kind enough to
rent us his car for the day.

196
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,529
Down there.

197
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:41,008
Can I help you?

198
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,343
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

199
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,983
Isn't it beautiful?

200
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:54,354
Yes. Fuck off. It's
very, very beautiful.

201
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,724
Baby, you need your umbrella?

202
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:59,326
Thanks, darling.

203
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,628
- Come on.
- Take the wine.

204
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:01,705
- Take this?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

205
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:02,729
Thank you.

206
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:20,280
James...

207
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:23,417
do you want a buffalo sausage?

208
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,721
No, if I ate another
sausage, I would vomit.

209
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:28,690
Can you vomit first
and then eat one?

210
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:30,257
They're coming out perfectly.

211
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,327
Are you trying to kill me?

212
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,730
I'm just fattening
you for dinner.

213
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:38,165
You will be our final course.

214
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,802
Once the oil starts
coming out of your eyes,

215
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:43,805
I'll fry you with rosemary,

216
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:47,074
and Em can eat your balls
like a real marriage.

217
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,776
How do you know I
haven't already?

218
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,646
Look at him, he's
too disobedient.

219
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,447
- Gab?
- Hm?

220
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,315
Do you want a buffalo
sausage, baby?

221
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,684
No.

222
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:58,786
Also disobedient,

223
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,256
and she doesn't even
have balls for us.

224
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:05,827
So why this guy,
if you don't mind?

225
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,731
He has no money. Why him?

226
00:17:09,764 --> 00:17:11,131
I don't know.

227
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:15,435
Mm, I suppose it has
to be daddy issues.

228
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:16,804
Daddy issues?

229
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:19,574
Well, my father hates him.

230
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:21,441
Oh, come on, be serious.

231
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,778
She is serious.

232
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:26,514
My... My father runs
a publishing house,

233
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:27,791
and the one thing
that he told me

234
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:29,851
was to never marry a writer.

235
00:17:29,884 --> 00:17:31,586
Of course.

236
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,353
But my father was
also a monster,

237
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,189
so I married the
first broke writer

238
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,091
to spill coffee on me.

239
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,727
- Really?
- Yeah.

240
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,077
Almost done.

241
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,530
I'm sleeping in
the back with Em.

242
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,969
Fuck, I'm still drunk.

243
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:04,739
I can drive.

244
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:05,907
You sure?

245
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,508
Yeah, I'm good.

246
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:09,342
All right, thank you.

247
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:23,624
Okay.

248
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:31,291
Come on.

249
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

250
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,775
No!

251
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,784
What the fuck was that?

252
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:00,021
James?

253
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:05,793
Stay in the car.

254
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,072
What did you do?

255
00:22:18,105 --> 00:22:19,774
Oh, my God!

256
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:24,679
Fuck, James. Fuck!

257
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:30,685
I didn't see him.

258
00:22:30,718 --> 00:22:32,787
- I couldn't see!
- We have to call someone.

259
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,387
Call who?

260
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:36,099
Call the resort, they'll
call our consulate.

261
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:37,457
Nobody will find us.

262
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,527
How do you call the police?

263
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,997
No police. Get
back in the car.

264
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,132
We're not calling the police.

265
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:48,603
W... Wait.

266
00:22:48,636 --> 00:22:51,072
Do you know anything
about jail in Li Tolqa?

267
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:53,183
This isn't a civilized country.
It's brutal and it's filthy.

268
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:54,484
We're not getting
picked up for this.

269
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:55,810
Get back in the car now!

270
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:57,078
It was an accident.

271
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:59,914
She's right. It's very
dangerous for us now.

272
00:22:59,947 --> 00:23:01,616
Oh, my God. James, we can't.

273
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:04,018
What do you think's
gonna happen to you?

274
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,485
You'll be raped
by police tonight

275
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,663
and tomorrow they'll
find your body.

276
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:07,764
That's how it works
with these animals.

277
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:09,023
I'm not doing that.

278
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,834
You get back in the car,
we drive, you go to bed.

279
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:11,869
Alban and I will
deal with Mr. Thresh

280
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:13,928
directly in the morning. Now!

281
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:20,701
Now! Alban, drive!

282
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,568
Hello?

283
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:56,103
- Hey.
- Hi, there.

284
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:01,175
Guys, we seem to be locked out.

285
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,843
And who are you?

286
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:05,179
Well, we're guests
at the Pa Qlqa.

287
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:07,782
We're staying here
but we got lost.

288
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:09,784
How did you get
through the gate?

289
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:11,052
Excuse me, sir.

290
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:12,820
But we were just coming
back from the disco,

291
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:16,524
and we seem to have found
ourselves outside somehow.

292
00:24:16,557 --> 00:24:22,196
We... We must have gone around.
Here, look. My key card.

293
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:24,198
I'm sorry, I'm not
sure what happened.

294
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:25,900
Maybe the fence
is drunk tonight.

295
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:27,935
James, you have your key card?

296
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:36,243
Guests are not allowed

297
00:24:36,277 --> 00:24:37,678
beyond the border
of the compound.

298
00:24:37,712 --> 00:24:39,046
Yeah, we know.

299
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,148
We're extremely sorry.
It won't happen again.

300
00:24:47,722 --> 00:24:49,156
Thank you.

301
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:05,639
You're okay, yeah?
You're gonna be okay.

302
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:09,043
We'll see you at breakfast.

303
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,581
Yeah. I'm coming.

304
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:55,222
I'm coming!

305
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:08,202
Mr. James Foster?

306
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:11,072
Yeah?

307
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:15,276
You'll have to come with us.

308
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,345
Excuse me. Excuse me,
where are we going?

309
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:24,945
No, no, no!

310
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:26,180
James!

311
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:27,257
We're together.
We're together!

312
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:28,315
James!

313
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:30,417
I'll go... I'll go with her.

314
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:33,754
Em, I'll find you!
I'll find you!

315
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,434
Hello?

316
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:26,340
Hello? Can you let me
out of here, please?

317
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,879
Hello?

318
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:45,759
Sorry to keep you waiting.

319
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:47,461
Where's my wife?

320
00:28:47,494 --> 00:28:50,397
Mrs. Foster is fine.

321
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:52,499
I was speaking with
her in the other room,

322
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,802
just down the hall from here.

323
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:58,072
A lovely woman.

324
00:28:58,105 --> 00:29:03,511
You must feel very lucky.

325
00:29:03,545 --> 00:29:05,379
Smoke?

326
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:06,747
No, thank you.

327
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:24,064
My name is Detective
Iral Thresh.

328
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:30,070
That surname will
sound familiar,

329
00:29:30,104 --> 00:29:31,805
as you met my uncle Dro Thresh,

330
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,110
who works at the Pa Qlqa
Pearl Princess resort.

331
00:29:36,143 --> 00:29:40,447
I'm told he rented you
his car yesterday morning.

332
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:43,417
James, I'm going to
ask if that's true,

333
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,886
but before you answer, I
should explain that my uncle

334
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,988
will be in a great
deal of trouble

335
00:29:48,022 --> 00:29:51,925
if he rented you the car,
so, for his benefits,

336
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:57,831
would you agree to answer that
he did not rent it to you?

337
00:29:57,865 --> 00:30:00,301
What would that change for me?

338
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:03,437
Nothing. It's just something
I would appreciate,

339
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,241
given the situation.

340
00:30:07,274 --> 00:30:08,942
Okay.

341
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:10,177
Thank you.

342
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:23,390
Mr. Foster, did a resort
worker named Dro Thresh

343
00:30:23,424 --> 00:30:24,925
rent you his car
yesterday morning

344
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:27,828
at the Pa Qlqa Pearl Princess?

345
00:30:31,065 --> 00:30:32,433
No.

346
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:36,036
Good.

347
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,440
The Bauer couple,
Gabi and Alban,

348
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:41,609
have already explained
that after stealing a car

349
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:45,613
from a man named Dro Thresh
at the Pa Qlqa Pearl Princess,

350
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:48,349
you went on a joyride with
your wife up the coast.

351
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:50,884
There you became
intoxicated and hit a farmer

352
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:54,455
named Myro Myron,
killing him instantly.

353
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:58,359
You fled the accident without
contacting the police,

354
00:30:58,392 --> 00:31:00,562
and Mr. Myron's body
was found by his family

355
00:31:00,595 --> 00:31:03,197
yesterday morning.

356
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,533
Your wife has
confirmed this account.

357
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:11,071
Em... Em did?

358
00:31:11,105 --> 00:31:12,306
Mm-hm.

359
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,079
She was quite forthcoming.

360
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:22,249
Under our federal
law in Li Tolqa,

361
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:24,686
if you are responsible
for the death of a man,

362
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:27,655
including in the case of
an avoidable accident,

363
00:31:27,689 --> 00:31:31,258
his eldest son should kill you
to preserve the family's honor.

364
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:34,228
We do it here in the
station, on Level B.

365
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:39,032
Wha...?

366
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:42,002
What... What'd you say?

367
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:43,437
In the case that
there is no son,

368
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,339
the state will
take on that role.

369
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:47,174
But luckily, Mr. Myron
has two sons,

370
00:31:47,207 --> 00:31:49,309
ages nine and 13.

371
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:53,947
But... But... But... But
it's not... I'm sorry.

372
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:57,585
Please. Please. It... it...

373
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:02,089
James, it is unlikely
that we will kill you.

374
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:04,258
Are you aware of the Revised
Process of Doubles Act

375
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:07,161
for International
Visitors and Diplomats?

376
00:32:09,697 --> 00:32:12,332
Physical doubles.

377
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:13,744
This is the deal my
government offers

378
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:15,969
to foreign visitors
in your situation

379
00:32:16,003 --> 00:32:19,707
as part of our longstanding
tourism initiative.

380
00:32:19,741 --> 00:32:23,745
For a significant sum, the
state will build a double

381
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:26,447
to stand in for your execution.

382
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,418
Importantly, and this is key
to our diplomatic agreement,

383
00:32:31,452 --> 00:32:33,721
it will also maintain
your memories,

384
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:37,024
and so will believe itself
to be guilty of your crimes

385
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:38,492
at the time of death.

386
00:32:38,526 --> 00:32:41,462
Do you, James William Foster,
consent to be doubled,

387
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:44,031
and to the associated fee,

388
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:47,201
for the purposes of satisfying
our legal proceedings?

389
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:54,542
I'm sorry. I... I... I
don't quite understand.

390
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:57,545
Would you prefer to be executed?

391
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:01,448
Please sign.

392
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:12,520
No, no, no.

393
00:34:12,554 --> 00:34:13,788
Gown, please.

394
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,569
Inside.

395
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:20,655
This, please.

396
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

397
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:43,363
Are you all right?

398
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,404
Em? Where am I?

399
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:55,342
We're still at the
station. You're recovering.

400
00:37:57,011 --> 00:37:59,781
Does it hurt?

401
00:37:59,814 --> 00:38:04,085
My head is killing me.

402
00:38:04,118 --> 00:38:07,889
They told me the double
turned out correctly.

403
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:11,859
It's already finished.

404
00:38:11,893 --> 00:38:14,494
The double?

405
00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:17,330
The surrogate.

406
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:19,534
They're waiting
for us downstairs.

407
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:57,404
Often, it takes a few attempts.

408
00:38:57,437 --> 00:38:59,006
Even the smallest imperfection

409
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,944
is unacceptable to the
language of the law.

410
00:39:02,977 --> 00:39:07,615
But this one...

411
00:39:07,648 --> 00:39:12,820
has turned out the first time.

412
00:39:12,854 --> 00:39:14,088
But how...?

413
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:15,790
It's horrible.

414
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:29,971
It looks just like me.

415
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:34,175
You will both be present
for the execution.

416
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:36,177
Oh, no. I don't
want to see it.

417
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,712
This is non-negotiable.

418
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Oh.

419
00:39:46,754 --> 00:39:48,890
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

420
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:08,501
Please... James.

421
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:20,848
No. No, no, no.

422
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:25,052
Please. Don't. I... I...

423
00:41:25,086 --> 00:41:27,855
Please don't. I didn't...

424
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:33,828
Em, please. Em, please!

425
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:37,665
Em! Em!

426
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:43,571
Em, help me! Em!

427
00:41:43,604 --> 00:41:47,708
Please help! Em!

428
00:41:47,742 --> 00:41:53,681
Help me! Help, Em! Help!

429
00:41:57,318 --> 00:42:01,522
No! Em, please!

430
00:43:35,983 --> 00:43:38,953
This is the ashes
for you to take.

431
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:40,621
Consider this a souvenir.

432
00:43:42,957 --> 00:43:45,826
A car is waiting to bring
you back to the resort.

433
00:43:55,736 --> 00:43:59,406
Can you fucking help?

434
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,109
All right, there's a shuttle
to the airport in 15 minutes.

435
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:06,180
James? James!

436
00:44:06,213 --> 00:44:08,149
Yeah? Yeah.

437
00:44:08,182 --> 00:44:09,650
What the fuck.

438
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:28,369
Where the...?

439
00:44:28,402 --> 00:44:29,770
What?

440
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:32,406
My passport. I can't
find my passport.

441
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:34,041
What do you mean?

442
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:35,218
I don't know. I always
put it in my carry-on.

443
00:44:35,242 --> 00:44:36,310
It's not here.

444
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:37,387
What do you mean
you can't find it?

445
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:38,879
I... I don't know where it is.

446
00:44:38,913 --> 00:44:40,090
- It... It's all...
- James, we have to leave.

447
00:44:40,114 --> 00:44:41,815
Well, I know, I'm
looking but it's not,

448
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:42,959
- I can't... I don't know...
- We have to leave!

449
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:44,418
We have to leave!
We have to leave!

450
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:45,753
Fuck!

451
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:06,106
If you want to go without
me, I'll understand.

452
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,279
I'll come home as soon
as I can get on a flight.

453
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:20,754
Em?

454
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:29,129
It's really so disgusting.

455
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:33,300
What?

456
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:44,512
It's really so disgusting
that you could just...

457
00:45:44,546 --> 00:45:48,082
sit there

458
00:45:48,115 --> 00:45:51,452
and watch it happen.

459
00:45:51,485 --> 00:45:57,091
Like a robot.

460
00:45:57,124 --> 00:45:58,526
What's wrong with you?

461
00:46:05,266 --> 00:46:08,936
I'm gonna go down
to the front desk,

462
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:14,008
see if they can help.

463
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:18,379
Okay?

464
00:46:18,412 --> 00:46:19,947
I'll be right back.

465
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:30,592
Yes, I understand.

466
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:32,993
Thank you. Thank you.

467
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:36,163
Thank you for your
patience, Mr. Foster.

468
00:46:36,196 --> 00:46:37,998
Would you like us to
extend your room booking?

469
00:46:41,235 --> 00:46:42,504
Mr. Foster?

470
00:46:44,606 --> 00:46:49,511
Sorry. Um, is our
room still available?

471
00:46:49,544 --> 00:46:51,078
Yes, Mr. Foster.

472
00:46:51,111 --> 00:46:52,379
Your room is still available

473
00:46:52,413 --> 00:46:54,915
until we close down at
the end of the month.

474
00:46:54,948 --> 00:46:56,259
We have a number
of free rooms now

475
00:46:56,283 --> 00:46:59,920
with the rainy season coming up.

476
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:04,091
Okay. Well, let's say extend it
by another week, to start with.

477
00:47:04,124 --> 00:47:07,328
Uh, will this still
be under Em Foster?

478
00:47:08,462 --> 00:47:10,497
Yes.

479
00:47:10,532 --> 00:47:12,032
Wonderful.

480
00:47:12,066 --> 00:47:13,943
Is there anything else I
can help you with today?

481
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:15,235
No. Thank you.

482
00:47:21,442 --> 00:47:23,578
Are you leaving us?

483
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:25,279
As soon as I can.

484
00:47:25,312 --> 00:47:26,347
That's a shame.

485
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:31,318
James, I'm sorry.

486
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:38,459
Come have a drink with
me and let me explain.

487
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:40,861
Please.

488
00:47:44,331 --> 00:47:46,500
The first year we came,
Alban was working as

489
00:47:46,534 --> 00:47:50,104
a consultant on the
construction of a new resort.

490
00:47:50,137 --> 00:47:53,207
The Bot Vre 2. Do you know it?

491
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,175
No.

492
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:56,554
It's just a few
compounds over from here,

493
00:47:56,578 --> 00:47:58,379
north up the beach.

494
00:47:58,412 --> 00:48:01,014
They were installing
an infinity pool,

495
00:48:01,048 --> 00:48:03,417
one of Alban's designs.

496
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,985
A little pervy,
with a glass bottom

497
00:48:05,018 --> 00:48:08,222
that you could look
up into from the bar.

498
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:10,190
But the plate split
and fell off the crane,

499
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:12,292
and two workers were killed.

500
00:48:12,326 --> 00:48:14,662
The owner of the Bot Vre
put the blame on Alban

501
00:48:14,696 --> 00:48:18,666
and so we were arrested.
Penalty of death.

502
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,570
And we made a discovery then
that you have now discovered.

503
00:48:22,604 --> 00:48:25,139
A discovery.

504
00:48:25,172 --> 00:48:30,645
Are you upset? Maybe
think of it as a gift.

505
00:48:33,548 --> 00:48:35,650
You said you were
looking for inspiration.

506
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:43,190
There's something to the
experience, isn't there?

507
00:48:43,223 --> 00:48:46,493
You come out of it feeling...

508
00:48:46,528 --> 00:48:48,506
it's hard to explain but
I can see it in your eyes,

509
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,997
if you know what I mean.

510
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:56,336
Will you come to
our villa tonight?

511
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:58,381
There are a few others we've
encountered over the years

512
00:48:58,405 --> 00:49:01,041
who share our little secret.

513
00:49:24,097 --> 00:49:26,233
Oh, James.

514
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:29,303
James, you made it.

515
00:49:31,104 --> 00:49:35,342
You're completely transformed.
You look so beautiful now.

516
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:38,212
I can see the beauty just
pouring right out of you.

517
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:40,748
Here, quickly.

518
00:49:40,782 --> 00:49:43,518
- Yes.
- Quickly.

519
00:49:43,551 --> 00:49:48,255
Yes, that's correct.

520
00:49:48,288 --> 00:49:51,391
A little bit more.
Here. Here. Come.

521
00:49:51,425 --> 00:49:53,595
- Thank you.
- Come, come, come, come.

522
00:49:53,628 --> 00:49:57,197
Everyone, everyone.

523
00:49:57,231 --> 00:50:01,536
This is the new friend
I was telling you about.

524
00:50:01,569 --> 00:50:07,441
James, this is Charles,
Jennifer, Dr. Modan,

525
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:09,711
and the beautiful Bex.

526
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:13,815
Nice to meet you.

527
00:50:13,848 --> 00:50:16,751
Do you know that Bex's
father is a film producer?

528
00:50:16,784 --> 00:50:18,418
Wow.

529
00:50:18,452 --> 00:50:21,656
Maybe he'll turn your
book into a movie.

530
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:23,591
So, you're a writer?

531
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:26,393
Sort of.

532
00:50:26,426 --> 00:50:27,529
Sort of?

533
00:50:28,863 --> 00:50:30,532
What does that mean?

534
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:32,667
James wrote a very
brilliant book that I love.

535
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,668
Mm.

536
00:50:33,701 --> 00:50:35,402
Okay.

537
00:50:35,435 --> 00:50:37,505
So then, what is
this book about?

538
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:40,173
Don't harass the man. He's
just had a very bad day.

539
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:44,244
It's quite all right.

540
00:50:44,278 --> 00:50:45,756
I'm just curious
about our new zombie.

541
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,481
You don't have to
be afraid, James.

542
00:50:47,515 --> 00:50:49,316
We are all zombies here.

543
00:50:51,886 --> 00:50:53,655
Well, you're certainly
a flesh-eater.

544
00:50:53,688 --> 00:50:55,455
- Oh, please.
- Ladies.

545
00:50:57,625 --> 00:51:01,461
Everyone here is
a brother, James.

546
00:51:01,495 --> 00:51:03,463
You don't understand
Li Tolqa yet,

547
00:51:03,497 --> 00:51:05,867
but they are very
generous with discipline,

548
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,869
especially if they
know you can pay.

549
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:13,675
Very conservative
outside the resorts.

550
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:16,343
Very religious.

551
00:51:16,376 --> 00:51:22,316
They will kill you for
drugs, blasphemy, sodomy.

552
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:28,322
Can you guess which
one of us was sodomy?

553
00:51:31,593 --> 00:51:32,736
Honestly, it's
amazing that anyone

554
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,495
is still alive in this country.

555
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:38,833
You know, James, I'm glad
you could come tonight.

556
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:41,435
It's a great time
to have you with us.

557
00:51:41,468 --> 00:51:42,870
Dr. Modan is writing a paper

558
00:51:42,904 --> 00:51:45,472
on the Li Tolqan
doubling tradition.

559
00:51:45,506 --> 00:51:47,207
It's Bob, please.

560
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,476
I was wondering if I
could ask you a question

561
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:52,479
while you're still
fresh, as they say.

562
00:51:52,513 --> 00:51:54,916
Sure.

563
00:51:54,949 --> 00:51:57,384
Do you worry they
got the wrong man?

564
00:51:57,417 --> 00:51:58,886
Oh, God.

565
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,322
Do... Do you think, I
mean, looking back on it,

566
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:04,525
that they killed the real James?

567
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,527
That was my biggest fear
after my own experience.

568
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:08,663
Because you wake up
in that little room,

569
00:52:08,696 --> 00:52:12,499
and for all you know, they
could've just swapped you out.

570
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:14,769
Hard to say what happened
while you were asleep.

571
00:52:14,802 --> 00:52:16,370
So, what does it matter?

572
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:18,438
You have to let it
go. I've let it go.

573
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:20,642
How can I?

574
00:52:20,675 --> 00:52:22,476
I'll never know if
I'm really myself,

575
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,344
for as long as I live.

576
00:52:24,378 --> 00:52:26,581
Exactly, so who cares?

577
00:52:26,614 --> 00:52:28,850
What do you think, James?

578
00:52:28,883 --> 00:52:33,855
Do you fear you may have just
witnessed your own demise?

579
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:35,288
I can only hope.

580
00:53:02,884 --> 00:53:04,719
Are you feeling all right?

581
00:53:07,722 --> 00:53:08,790
Ah, yeah, yeah.

582
00:53:08,823 --> 00:53:10,525
Just, um...

583
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:14,796
Maybe I had too much to drink.

584
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:16,363
I don't think that's it.

585
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:23,705
The first day is
always difficult.

586
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:29,677
It's like a new skin
working itself into place.

587
00:53:29,711 --> 00:53:32,980
And in your case, I can see
something special happening.

588
00:53:38,052 --> 00:53:41,622
I have this...

589
00:53:41,656 --> 00:53:45,425
pressure... in my head...

590
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:49,831
It will pass.

591
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:59,807
James...

592
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Will you trust me tonight?

593
00:54:11,886 --> 00:54:14,555
He got it from one of
the cleaning staff.

594
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:16,791
It's fine. Come.

595
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:22,797
That was a great shot.

596
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:26,567
James. James, why don't you
come over here for a moment.

597
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:28,736
I have a proposition for you.

598
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:30,638
Don't worry about this gun.

599
00:54:30,671 --> 00:54:32,039
I hear you have a
passport problem.

600
00:54:32,073 --> 00:54:33,574
Is that right?

601
00:54:33,608 --> 00:54:36,844
That can be a lot of trouble
in a place like this.

602
00:54:36,878 --> 00:54:38,311
I tell you what,

603
00:54:38,345 --> 00:54:41,314
I will talk to my
connections in immigration

604
00:54:41,348 --> 00:54:42,917
and see if I can help

605
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:44,919
if you play a little
game with us tonight.

606
00:54:44,952 --> 00:54:47,088
Ooh.

607
00:54:47,121 --> 00:54:49,957
We just have a little
plan tonight, James.

608
00:54:49,991 --> 00:54:51,659
Just a bit of fun.

609
00:54:51,692 --> 00:54:53,895
Yes, tell him about the mission.

610
00:54:53,928 --> 00:54:55,596
- The mission?
- Yes.

611
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:58,465
Early this week, the
owner of Bot Vre 2 resort,

612
00:54:58,498 --> 00:55:03,037
he was awarded a medal for
promoting Li Tolqan prosperity.

613
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,640
And there was a
ceremony on the beach.

614
00:55:05,673 --> 00:55:08,341
We found out the
owner lives in a house

615
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:09,877
just up the hill.

616
00:55:09,911 --> 00:55:15,482
So, we decided tonight we will
go get the medal for ourselves.

617
00:55:15,516 --> 00:55:20,621
Just a little game
to play, for fun.

618
00:55:20,655 --> 00:55:24,592
It's actually rather
important to us, James.

619
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:28,696
I mean, after all, he
did have us executed.

620
00:55:28,729 --> 00:55:31,431
At a certain point, if you don't
respond to an insult like that,

621
00:55:31,464 --> 00:55:33,544
you're such a coward that
you'll just fall to the ground

622
00:55:33,568 --> 00:55:35,703
and never get up again.

623
00:55:37,505 --> 00:55:39,372
What do you say?

624
00:55:41,142 --> 00:55:42,743
Or maybe we just off you now

625
00:55:42,777 --> 00:55:44,045
so you don't give us away.

626
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:39,800
A perfect likeness.

627
00:59:03,611 --> 00:59:05,813
We found it!

628
00:59:49,123 --> 00:59:52,026
Have you ever
fired a gun before?

629
01:00:10,945 --> 01:00:12,646
It would be so easy.

630
01:00:17,985 --> 01:00:20,287
Not everybody gets this chance.

631
01:01:00,094 --> 01:01:05,733
Hey, what are you
kids up to in here?

632
01:01:05,766 --> 01:01:07,234
Just playing chicken.

633
01:01:07,268 --> 01:01:11,872
Oh. Have you seen what
he has in this place?

634
01:01:11,906 --> 01:01:14,241
James, you're going
to want a drink,

635
01:01:14,275 --> 01:01:16,010
and you're going
to want a cigar.

636
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,383
You have beautiful taste, sir.

637
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:24,385
I'm really starting to like you.

638
01:02:11,865 --> 01:02:14,134
We need to get him
inside, right now.

639
01:02:14,168 --> 01:02:16,870
Yes.

640
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:19,306
My building is just
around the corner.

641
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,342
To the right.

642
01:02:34,822 --> 01:02:36,423
It's okay, honey!

643
01:02:36,457 --> 01:02:38,392
- I need some towels.
- James, what's going on?

644
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:40,160
No, no, no, no!

645
01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:49,103
They really should
have water in here.

646
01:02:49,136 --> 01:02:50,481
Charles, do you have
any water on you?

647
01:02:50,505 --> 01:02:53,841
They took my bag, sweetheart.

648
01:02:53,874 --> 01:02:54,951
Why don't you be a gentleman

649
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,477
and give Gabi your seat?

650
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,846
Because I'm old.

651
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:01,549
I went for a
colonoscopy last month,

652
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:05,085
and it was like looking at
a painting by Jackson Polyp.

653
01:03:07,221 --> 01:03:10,057
James, do you know why
the doubling tradition

654
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:13,460
is unique to Li Tolqa?

655
01:03:13,494 --> 01:03:18,065
I'm starting to think it's
just their poetic flair.

656
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:20,467
We've spent years trying to
reproduce the process in the lab

657
01:03:20,501 --> 01:03:23,505
but we're far too literal.

658
01:03:23,538 --> 01:03:24,615
We just never taken
into account...

659
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:26,440
Uh, finally.

660
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:28,208
The transcend connection...

661
01:03:28,242 --> 01:03:29,343
Hi.

662
01:03:29,376 --> 01:03:31,979
We've been waiting
in here for hours.

663
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,049
Do you feel you've
been inconvenienced?

664
01:03:36,383 --> 01:03:37,552
Well...

665
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:44,291
Our country is not a playground
for foreign children.

666
01:03:44,325 --> 01:03:46,994
It sometimes seems we
have forgotten this.

667
01:03:48,162 --> 01:03:50,898
But maybe not today.

668
01:03:50,931 --> 01:03:53,568
You've tested the limits
of our hospitality.

669
01:03:53,601 --> 01:03:57,004
And today I'm feeling
inspired to make a statement.

670
01:03:58,405 --> 01:04:01,008
What do you say?

671
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:02,041
Yes, please.

672
01:04:04,646 --> 01:04:05,913
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey!

673
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,115
I can walk.

674
01:04:08,148 --> 01:04:10,017
What's going on?

675
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,285
- Go now!
- Okay.

676
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:12,286
Okay.

677
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:13,287
Okay.

678
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,055
Come on.

679
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:23,997
Where are we?

680
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:28,068
Detective, where are we going?

681
01:04:28,102 --> 01:04:29,537
We're ready to pay now.

682
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:50,424
Alban!

683
01:05:04,304 --> 01:05:05,339
Alban!

684
01:05:09,076 --> 01:05:10,244
Leave her alone!

685
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:13,280
No!

686
01:05:18,218 --> 01:05:19,286
Get away from me!

687
01:05:22,022 --> 01:05:24,024
- Get away from me!
- James!

688
01:05:29,296 --> 01:05:30,598
No! Go! Aah!

689
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:50,618
James!

690
01:05:56,691 --> 01:06:01,094
Bravo! Bravo!

691
01:06:01,128 --> 01:06:02,564
Well done, James!

692
01:06:02,597 --> 01:06:05,232
I didn't think
you had it in you!

693
01:06:07,434 --> 01:06:10,070
Beautiful.

694
01:06:33,761 --> 01:06:35,128
Em?

695
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:39,199
What's wrong with you?

696
01:06:39,233 --> 01:06:40,400
With me?

697
01:06:41,803 --> 01:06:44,137
I'm leaving.

698
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:46,306
I don't have a passport.

699
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,409
Well then, I guess
you get to stay.

700
01:06:49,443 --> 01:06:51,378
They told me I've already paid.

701
01:06:59,554 --> 01:07:01,054
Is this a dream?

702
01:07:04,124 --> 01:07:05,527
It would make more sense.

703
01:07:09,697 --> 01:07:11,365
You've gone wrong
around the eyes,

704
01:07:11,398 --> 01:07:13,400
like one of those
crabs at the dump.

705
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:19,273
Go on, then.

706
01:07:20,542 --> 01:07:22,109
Run back to Daddy.

707
01:07:36,658 --> 01:07:38,158
Wait...

708
01:08:26,774 --> 01:08:28,241
Em left today.

709
01:08:29,711 --> 01:08:31,478
That may be for the best.

710
01:08:38,318 --> 01:08:39,621
We've been together ten years.

711
01:08:41,589 --> 01:08:42,724
It's none of my business

712
01:08:42,757 --> 01:08:44,559
but I don't really
think she suits you.

713
01:08:48,596 --> 01:08:50,497
Men are trained by women like Em

714
01:08:50,531 --> 01:08:53,701
to see themselves as weak.

715
01:08:53,735 --> 01:08:55,770
It can take some work to undo.

716
01:08:58,205 --> 01:08:59,507
It can take some blood.

717
01:09:02,777 --> 01:09:04,612
I don't know about that.

718
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:43,818
The rainy season is coming.

719
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:47,254
Will you walk with me?

720
01:10:28,328 --> 01:10:30,330
What's that?

721
01:10:30,363 --> 01:10:32,466
It's called the ekki gate.

722
01:10:32,499 --> 01:10:35,970
It's a traditional
Li Tolqan root drug.

723
01:10:36,003 --> 01:10:37,638
I got it from one of the guards.

724
01:10:39,372 --> 01:10:40,440
What does it do?

725
01:10:41,576 --> 01:10:43,711
It's a hallucinogen.

726
01:10:43,745 --> 01:10:44,779
Also an aphrodisiac.

727
01:10:48,716 --> 01:10:52,053
Drug use is heavily restricted
in the modern state,

728
01:10:52,086 --> 01:10:53,921
but this is considered
to be religious.

729
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:14,642
I want you to show me
how strong you are.

730
01:11:39,834 --> 01:11:41,602
It's horrible.

731
01:11:41,636 --> 01:11:42,870
You'll come to like it.

732
01:12:06,661 --> 01:12:08,696
How long does it
take for it to work?

733
01:17:00,855 --> 01:17:03,057
Come on.

734
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:04,191
Pathetic.

735
01:17:07,194 --> 01:17:09,363
Ooh.

736
01:17:09,396 --> 01:17:12,133
Not so loud.

737
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:13,167
You know, James,

738
01:17:14,468 --> 01:17:18,072
I spoke to my son-in-law
about your passport.

739
01:17:18,105 --> 01:17:19,106
About what?

740
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:22,143
Your new... Your new passport.

741
01:17:22,176 --> 01:17:26,213
He said it's Thresh who is
the problem, the detective.

742
01:17:26,247 --> 01:17:28,282
Thresh is holding you
back from leaving.

743
01:17:28,315 --> 01:17:31,252
Probably hoping to
bring you in again

744
01:17:31,285 --> 01:17:34,855
and fill up his pretty
police piggy bank.

745
01:17:34,889 --> 01:17:37,758
The Li Tolqans only
understand one thing.

746
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:40,961
You need to show him that you're
the dominant in this conflict.

747
01:17:40,995 --> 01:17:42,730
Yeah.

748
01:17:42,763 --> 01:17:44,865
They're like baboons.

749
01:17:44,899 --> 01:17:47,201
Like baboons, but
we think we know

750
01:17:47,234 --> 01:17:49,236
just the thing to help.

751
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:50,471
Oh, yeah?

752
01:17:50,504 --> 01:17:54,308
Trigeminal neuralgia, James.

753
01:17:54,341 --> 01:17:56,744
<i>It seems the
detective is due for</i>

754
01:17:56,777 --> 01:17:59,380
<i>a glycerol injection tonight</i>

755
01:17:59,413 --> 01:18:01,315
<i>at Li Tolqa Brain and Spine.</i>

756
01:18:12,527 --> 01:18:15,396
Hey, James. James.

757
01:18:17,765 --> 01:18:18,899
Why don't you stand down?

758
01:18:21,001 --> 01:18:22,203
We're gonna be fast.

759
01:19:43,017 --> 01:19:44,885
Any trouble?

760
01:19:44,918 --> 01:19:47,087
There was a police van...

761
01:19:47,121 --> 01:19:49,456
Almost ran me down.

762
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,559
Oh. They just sold
out their boss.

763
01:19:51,593 --> 01:19:53,327
Probably had to get drunk first.

764
01:21:05,265 --> 01:21:06,300
Oh.

765
01:21:12,607 --> 01:21:14,375
Show him your strength, James.

766
01:21:22,416 --> 01:21:24,351
Yeah, I like that. I like that.

767
01:21:24,385 --> 01:21:26,320
Attaboy, James.

768
01:21:26,353 --> 01:21:28,055
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

769
01:21:46,641 --> 01:21:51,378
Oh!

770
01:21:59,386 --> 01:22:04,291
Oh!

771
01:22:33,521 --> 01:22:35,122
Aaaaahhh!

772
01:22:38,459 --> 01:22:40,060
Whooh!

773
01:24:50,525 --> 01:24:52,326
James.

774
01:24:54,762 --> 01:24:57,130
James, come on. You aren't
really upset, are you?

775
01:24:57,164 --> 01:24:59,299
It's just a little joke.

776
01:24:59,333 --> 01:25:01,234
We paid the detective
to make another double

777
01:25:01,268 --> 01:25:03,370
just to have a
little fun with you.

778
01:25:07,609 --> 01:25:08,810
James, open up.

779
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:14,515
Maybe I'll bring the double
here and you can both fuck me.

780
01:25:14,549 --> 01:25:15,717
Have you ever tried that?

781
01:25:19,787 --> 01:25:21,421
Don't be pathetic
tonight, James.

782
01:25:21,455 --> 01:25:23,357
It's so unattractive.

783
01:27:09,664 --> 01:27:10,865
Hi.

784
01:27:56,577 --> 01:27:58,278
James!

785
01:28:04,952 --> 01:28:06,754
James!

786
01:28:07,889 --> 01:28:10,725
Come out, James!

787
01:28:12,593 --> 01:28:17,464
What are you doing
in there, James? Huh?

788
01:28:17,497 --> 01:28:21,602
Where do you think you're
going, you little baby?

789
01:28:24,437 --> 01:28:30,477
James!

790
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:45,392
Members of the bus!

791
01:28:47,962 --> 01:28:50,865
Give us the coward James Foster,

792
01:28:50,898 --> 01:28:54,101
or I will come in shooting!

793
01:28:54,135 --> 01:28:57,470
He is a spineless
worm and a bedwetter

794
01:28:57,504 --> 01:29:01,542
and he'd sell his own mother
for horse meat to save himself!

795
01:29:16,489 --> 01:29:22,129
Yeah. Jamesy!

796
01:29:22,163 --> 01:29:26,067
Come on. Come on, little baby.

797
01:29:27,635 --> 01:29:31,973
Come on, James. Come on. Come.

798
01:29:56,931 --> 01:29:59,033
You're so pathetic, James.

799
01:30:00,467 --> 01:30:02,169
A real sucky baby.

800
01:30:04,105 --> 01:30:07,141
I can always pick out
a sucky baby for us.

801
01:30:08,576 --> 01:30:09,576
What a joke.

802
01:30:11,045 --> 01:30:14,548
This whole time, we've
been laughing at you.

803
01:30:14,582 --> 01:30:17,450
You're just a bit of fun
for us on our vacation.

804
01:30:18,619 --> 01:30:21,689
And such a terrible driver!

805
01:30:21,722 --> 01:30:24,457
I can't believe you ran
that guy over, James.

806
01:30:24,491 --> 01:30:26,527
Do you remember that?

807
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,829
We thought we'd have to
get you into trouble,

808
01:30:28,863 --> 01:30:31,866
turns out you're such an
idiot you did it yourself.

809
01:30:35,202 --> 01:30:36,704
Faster!

810
01:30:41,809 --> 01:30:43,144
I never read your book.

811
01:30:47,682 --> 01:30:48,983
Did you believe that?

812
01:30:51,686 --> 01:30:52,887
I'm a good actress.

813
01:30:54,855 --> 01:30:56,223
It was hard to look you up.

814
01:30:57,925 --> 01:31:02,997
One shitty book six years
ago that nobody read.

815
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:05,199
Bad reviews.

816
01:31:05,232 --> 01:31:06,934
You're so vain, James,

817
01:31:06,968 --> 01:31:08,869
to actually believe
that we read it.

818
01:31:08,903 --> 01:31:10,137
It's sort of funny,

819
01:31:10,171 --> 01:31:12,206
but really more than
anything, it's depressing.

820
01:31:14,608 --> 01:31:16,177
Mm.

821
01:31:18,713 --> 01:31:23,050
I do have a review
with me, Jamesy.

822
01:31:24,952 --> 01:31:25,987
Have you read this one?

823
01:31:28,055 --> 01:31:33,160
<i>"The Variable Sheath:</i>
As Bad as Its Title.

824
01:31:33,194 --> 01:31:36,931
Seeming to recognize
his own lack of talent,

825
01:31:36,964 --> 01:31:42,036
newcomer James W. Foster
overcompensates with pretension,

826
01:31:42,069 --> 01:31:45,740
failed posturing that
only serves to emphasize

827
01:31:45,773 --> 01:31:49,577
how truly terrible
this debut really is.

828
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:52,813
<i>Sheath</i> is a book that
has nothing to say

829
01:31:52,847 --> 01:31:55,216
and lacks the words to say it.

830
01:31:55,249 --> 01:31:59,153
One can't help but wonder
whether its very existence

831
01:31:59,186 --> 01:32:02,223
is owed to Foster's
powerful father-in-law,

832
01:32:02,256 --> 01:32:05,326
media mogul Edward Servek.

833
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:08,763
Maurice Tate is an
overwritten urologist

834
01:32:08,796 --> 01:32:11,599
whose unconvincing marital
struggles therein..."

835
01:32:11,632 --> 01:32:15,669
Ah. Oh, no. Alban, my wine.

836
01:32:17,772 --> 01:32:21,175
-Oh, Jamesy! Oh, no. Oh, no.

837
01:32:21,208 --> 01:32:22,243
James. What are you doing?

838
01:32:22,276 --> 01:32:23,644
James!

839
01:32:28,682 --> 01:32:30,051
No! No!

840
01:32:30,084 --> 01:32:31,986
No! No! No!

841
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:43,697
Oh, no! James!

842
01:32:43,731 --> 01:32:44,698
Come on.

843
01:32:44,732 --> 01:32:47,134
Come on.

844
01:32:47,168 --> 01:32:48,202
James.

845
01:32:56,677 --> 01:32:58,646
Ah!

846
01:33:12,927 --> 01:33:14,962
James!

847
01:33:21,035 --> 01:33:22,903
James!

848
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:20,427
Help...

849
01:35:36,303 --> 01:35:37,404
No, don't...

850
01:36:07,134 --> 01:36:08,502
Help me, Em.

851
01:36:08,536 --> 01:36:11,939
Em, please help me.

852
01:37:21,676 --> 01:37:23,010
Hello?

853
01:37:34,054 --> 01:37:35,089
Hello?

854
01:38:00,515 --> 01:38:05,587
He emerges! Back
from the dead!

855
01:38:07,622 --> 01:38:12,259
Hey. James, here.

856
01:38:14,361 --> 01:38:18,600
Come. It's okay.

857
01:38:18,633 --> 01:38:21,435
It's okay. Come forward.

858
01:38:27,341 --> 01:38:31,044
Today we're going
to fix you, James.

859
01:38:31,078 --> 01:38:35,449
I know it's been hard,
but believe me when I say

860
01:38:35,482 --> 01:38:39,052
that we are on a
mission of mercy.

861
01:38:39,086 --> 01:38:43,558
It's time for you to shed that
disgusting larval mind of yours

862
01:38:43,591 --> 01:38:46,093
and find out what kind of
a creature you really are.

863
01:38:51,231 --> 01:38:53,066
Bring the dog.

864
01:38:56,303 --> 01:38:57,337
Come on.

865
01:39:25,299 --> 01:39:28,068
The dog is here for you to
complete your transformation.

866
01:39:30,504 --> 01:39:33,106
Only through blood can
you release your past.

867
01:39:58,499 --> 01:40:00,535
Sacrifice the dog, James.

868
01:40:14,114 --> 01:40:15,517
Kill the dog.

869
01:40:24,191 --> 01:40:27,361
Fuck you. Fuck all of you.

870
01:40:33,133 --> 01:40:34,669
Pick up the knife, James.

871
01:40:43,511 --> 01:40:45,078
It's for your own good.

872
01:40:54,556 --> 01:40:55,823
You pick it up.

873
01:41:01,328 --> 01:41:02,362
Go on.

874
01:41:03,698 --> 01:41:05,232
Go fetch!

875
01:42:54,374 --> 01:42:56,778
Come here. It's okay.

876
01:43:55,335 --> 01:43:56,369
Yeah.

877
01:43:57,772 --> 01:43:58,806
Mm-hm.

878
01:44:01,576 --> 01:44:02,810
Mm.

879
01:44:04,078 --> 01:44:05,345
Well, I'll land at ten,

880
01:44:05,378 --> 01:44:07,915
so I'll be home
around 11, 11:30.

881
01:44:11,853 --> 01:44:13,020
I'm so sorry, baby.

882
01:44:15,957 --> 01:44:16,991
Really am.

883
01:44:19,794 --> 01:44:24,364
Yeah.

884
01:44:24,397 --> 01:44:25,566
I miss you.

885
01:44:28,569 --> 01:44:30,538
Okay.

886
01:44:30,571 --> 01:44:31,815
Okay, but, I should
probably get going

887
01:44:31,839 --> 01:44:34,675
so I don't miss the shuttle.

888
01:44:34,709 --> 01:44:36,376
But I'll see you very soon.

889
01:44:37,578 --> 01:44:38,679
All right?

890
01:44:38,713 --> 01:44:40,815
I love you. Bye.

891
01:44:53,661 --> 01:44:54,695
Thank you.

892
01:44:57,364 --> 01:44:58,733
Thanks.

893
01:45:01,002 --> 01:45:03,336
There you go.

894
01:45:03,370 --> 01:45:04,705
Oh, Charles, did
you remind Stacy

895
01:45:04,739 --> 01:45:06,541
I have a spare key
under the planter?

896
01:45:06,574 --> 01:45:08,375
I spoke to her yesterday.

897
01:45:08,408 --> 01:45:09,744
I swear it's in one ear

898
01:45:09,777 --> 01:45:11,057
and out the other
with that girl.

899
01:45:16,383 --> 01:45:19,386
Gabi, what are you two doing
when you go back to LA?

900
01:45:19,419 --> 01:45:21,889
Oh, well, Alban is going
straight back to work,

901
01:45:21,923 --> 01:45:22,924
aren't you?

902
01:45:22,957 --> 01:45:24,424
Oh, yes, unfortunately.

903
01:45:24,457 --> 01:45:26,694
The spring issue of the
journal is coming up fast,

904
01:45:26,727 --> 01:45:27,995
and I'm behind.

905
01:45:28,029 --> 01:45:29,396
Which means I'll be eating alone

906
01:45:29,429 --> 01:45:30,998
and rearranging the house again.

907
01:45:31,032 --> 01:45:33,568
Please don't.

908
01:45:33,601 --> 01:45:35,570
Whenever I'm bored,
I rearrange the house

909
01:45:35,603 --> 01:45:36,643
and it drives Alban crazy.

910
01:45:36,671 --> 01:45:37,672
You don't.

911
01:45:37,705 --> 01:45:39,841
You and Bex must be related.

912
01:45:39,874 --> 01:45:41,843
I like to repaint
the walls as well.

913
01:45:41,876 --> 01:45:43,010
Don't give her any idea.

914
01:45:43,044 --> 01:45:44,712
Alban, that actually reminds me

915
01:45:44,745 --> 01:45:46,723
that we need to pay Jonas for
the work he did on the garage.

916
01:45:46,747 --> 01:45:48,415
I paid him last month.

917
01:45:48,448 --> 01:45:50,785
You did? He just sent me
an invoice before we left.

918
01:45:50,818 --> 01:45:52,787
<i>This is a pre-boarding call</i>

919
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:57,424
<i>for passengers traveling on
flight LT 907 to Los Angeles.</i>

920
01:45:57,457 --> 01:45:59,961
<i>Those passengers requiring
assistance boarding,</i>

921
01:45:59,994 --> 01:46:02,730
<i>those with small children,
and passengers flying with us</i>

922
01:46:02,763 --> 01:46:05,833
<i>in business class today,
please proceed to Gate C.</i>

923
01:46:05,867 --> 01:46:08,002
That's us.

924
01:46:08,035 --> 01:46:10,503
James, great to meet you.

925
01:46:10,538 --> 01:46:13,574
Hopefully we'll see
you again next year.

926
01:46:13,608 --> 01:46:16,077
Have a good flight.

927
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:17,444
You too.

928
01:47:02,056 --> 01:47:03,524
<i>This is the final boarding call</i>

929
01:47:03,557 --> 01:47:06,560
<i>for flight LT 606 to Melbourne.</i>

930
01:47:06,594 --> 01:47:09,764
<i>All remaining passengers
proceed to Gate One.</i>

931
01:47:09,797 --> 01:47:11,532
<i>I repeat, this is the
final boarding call</i>

932
01:47:11,565 --> 01:47:12,767
<i>for flight LT 606.</i>
