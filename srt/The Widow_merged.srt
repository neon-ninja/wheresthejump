[wind rustling]

00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:10,761
[wood creaking]

4
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:14,557
[eerie music]

5
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:36,287
[woman] <i>I can't possibly run
from there all the way back</i>

6
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:39,373
to my home,
so I move quickly.

7
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:41,584
I walk as fast
as I possibly can.

8
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,962
You can sense it
when someone's following you.

9
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:48,090
Even though
I never hear any footsteps,

10
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,676
I just have the feeling
someone's watching.

11
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,303
[ominous music]

12
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:54,805
[woman 2] <i>She was found in
the section of the map here</i>

13
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:56,724
<i>between the village
and the clinic.</i>

14
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:59,310
As you can see, the clinic
is quite far from the village

15
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:02,271
she started from and
they found her right over here

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,564
sitting on the ground.

17
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,652
Naked, completely in the nude.

18
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,737
Clothes folded beside her.

19
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,865
So then after that,

20
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:15,284
that was when
they sent in all the police,

21
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,119
all of the investigators,

22
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,872
they did their tests,
and in the end they admitted

23
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:21,832
that they had no idea
how she had died.

24
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:25,169
[light dramatic music]

25
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:27,296
[woman 3] <i>They tried to tell me
he took off his clothes</i>

26
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:28,631
and just died in the forest.

27
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:29,465
[interviewer] Mm-hm.

28
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,092
The local guys who found him

29
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,135
told me that he was actually
found naked,

30
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:37,139
but that there were some kind of
markings all over his skin

31
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,350
like he was tortured
or something like that.

32
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:41,060
- Who would do that?
- [interviewer] Yeah.

33
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,396
They put it on the news and
nothing ever came of it.

34
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,315
[light dramatic music]

35
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:49,193
[woman 4] <i>I try not to run
by there, but I do walk fast,</i>

36
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:50,987
- <i>really, really fast.</i>
- [interviewer] Mm-hm.

37
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,488
[woman 4] <i>You know,
I... I always feel like</i>

38
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:53,990
<i>there's someone
right behind me,</i>

39
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,658
[interviewer]
<i>And you said you hear nothing?</i>

40
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,369
[woman 4] <i>I hear nothing,
but I'm afraid to turn around.</i>

41
00:01:58,578 --> 00:01:59,453
- [interviewer] <i>Why is that?</i>
- [woman 4] <i>I'm afraid</i>

42
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,372
- <i>I'd terrify myself and fall.</i>
- [interviewer] <i>Mm.</i>

43
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:02,415
[woman 4]
<i>It... what it feels like</i>

44
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,042
<i>is that someone
is always around</i>

45
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:07,420
15 or 20 steps behind me.

46
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,754
- <i>It's hard to describe.</i>
- [interviewer] <i>Mm. Mm-hm.</i>

47
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,548
- [woman 4] <i>I can't.</i>
- [interviewer] <i>Mm-hm. Mm-hm.</i>

48
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,800
- <i>So, like, following you.</i>
- [woman 4] <i>That's right.</i>

49
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,677
<i>And I bet you
they're watching me.</i>

50
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,429
[dramatic music]

51
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,348
[woman 2]
<i>There is one, this woman,</i>

52
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:22,018
my village says
she takes people this way.

53
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,729
She took a child, a boy.

54
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:26,230
They found him.

55
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,232
He was just like the other ones.

56
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:29,900
- [light dramatic music]
- [metal rattling]

57
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,360
<i>Now they stay away from her.</i>

58
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:32,695
<i>That whole area,</i>

59
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:37,408
<i>farmers won't even run
their cattle by there anymore.</i>

60
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,286
<i>She hung herself.</i>

61
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:42,371
The only thing
people said about it

62
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,332
is that she sure had it coming.

63
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,877
[light dramatic music]

64
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:54,133
[heavy breathing]

65
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,476
Can you feel your legs?

66
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,061
Are you able to move?

67
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,023
Sit tight, we're gonna
get you out of here.

68
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:13,778
[reporter] Viktoria.

69
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,196
Mind if I ask you a question?

70
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:18,074
You guys,
why do you rescue people?

71
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,784
We each have our own reasons.

72
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:21,369
Someone has to do it, right?

73
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,663
Go talk to Andre.
It's my first call of the day.

74
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:26,832
- [dramatic music]
- [man screaming]

75
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:27,917
[Viktoria] Hold him.

76
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:29,627
- [man 2] Have to hold...
- Tuck in tighter, please.

77
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:30,753
[screaming continues]

78
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:31,837
Brace his leg.

79
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,255
Try to keep him still.

80
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:36,258
- I need a bandage.
- [screaming continues]

81
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:38,177
Ah, shit.

82
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,096
Lacerated artery.

83
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,390
[birds chirping]

84
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:43,391
[sighs]

85
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:45,518
[reporter] I have a mirror.

86
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,646
Viktoria, you weren't able
to save this man's life today.

87
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:49,814
How does that feel?

88
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,232
- [man screaming]
- I need a strap.

89
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,775
Don't have a strap,
only a bandage.

90
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:53,609
[Viktoria] Damn it!

91
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,069
Take off your belt, quickly.

92
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,196
I'd rather not answer
that question.

93
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,448
[reporter] Oh, come on,
it wasn't real this time.

94
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:00,199
[Viktoria] Mm-hm.

95
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:01,784
- [door thuds]
- [man screaming]

96
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:02,702
Try not to move.

97
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,996
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Time's up.

98
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:07,331
Time's up, guys.

99
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:08,791
Sorry, it's too late.

100
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,210
That's it, we lost the victim

101
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,045
due to significant blood loss.

102
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,381
[sighs] Damn it.

103
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,135
You can get up,
I didn't save you again.

104
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,052
[man] Give me a minute.

105
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,305
It's hard dying five times
in one day.

106
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,850
Does anyone see my cigarettes?

107
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:27,393
You can smoke later.

108
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:28,894
Right now
get the stretcher ready.

109
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,188
We still need to evacuate
your dead body.

110
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,442
Our visibility in the forest
is only about 30 meters,

111
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,695
however audibly, we can hear
about 200 meters.

112
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:41,073
That's assuming they're
still alert and can respond

113
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,742
and call out loud enough
for us to hear.

114
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,077
<i>Actually as rescuers,
we have a rule.</i>

115
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:46,871
<i>We always secure
the first person we find.</i>

116
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,247
<i>If it's more than one person,</i>

117
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,958
<i>hand off the first to
the medics before going back,</i>

118
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,543
<i>no gambling with lives.</i>

119
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,295
<i>At least
that's how we're trained.</i>

120
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,758
[man 2] <i>Our role is to
fully secure each individual.</i>

121
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:00,384
- [Viktoria] This one's done.
- [man 2] <i>As you can see here,</i>

122
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,845
<i>some of the environments
we find ourselves working in</i>

123
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,014
<i>are extremely dangerous
and cave rescues</i>

124
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,932
<i>are among the most
difficult jobs we have.</i>

125
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,269
<i>It's important
that we get this type</i>

126
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:11,812
<i>of hands-on training in.</i>

127
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,647
The thing I hate most
about my job

128
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,649
is working with
the dead bodies.

129
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,735
When you know
there's no one to rescue,

130
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:20,237
all you can do is
bring the body to the station

131
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:21,864
and onto the relatives
to deal with.

132
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:23,115
All right, we're good.

133
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,033
Ready to move.

134
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,326
- [Viktoria] All right.
- Let's get him up.

135
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,660
- Are you ready?
- [man] Let's go.

136
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:27,495
[grunting]

137
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:28,621
- Careful, careful.
- Keep holding tight.

138
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,706
- Careful!
- [heavy breathing]

139
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,458
[Viktoria]
Careful, it's slippery in here.

140
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,085
We're taught it's a sin
to get a slow start.

141
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,088
24 hours is a long time
in these elements,

142
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,007
every minute
could cost someone their life.

143
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:41,008
Go, go, go, go.

144
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,345
Careful.

145
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,473
[water sloshing]

146
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,351
Should I stand
closer to the water here

147
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,727
- or not?
- [reporter] No, you're good.

148
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:52,853
- No, you're right.
- [reporter] Unless you want to.

149
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,230
I guess you would know best.

150
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:56,232
Well, our team conducts searches
for people

151
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,025
who go missing in the wilds.

152
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:02,029
So in this area,
the forests, the swamps,

153
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:03,405
and the caves like here.

154
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:05,950
Watch your head.

155
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,326
Watch where you're going.

156
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,162
Look, it caved in here.

157
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,207
- Watch yourself here.
- [Viktoria] Careful, careful.

158
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,210
Hey, guys. Hang on.

159
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:17,545
Stop, stop.

160
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,004
What's going on?

161
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:20,256
What do you see?

162
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:22,842
This was also caved in.

163
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,595
There was a passage,
but it's blocked now.

164
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,514
If you choose to go
into the woods,

165
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,600
it makes sense to wear something
brightly colored like this,

166
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,562
for example,
red or orange or yellow.

167
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,564
I wouldn't advise
wearing camouflage.

168
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,482
And don't forget
to charge your phone.

169
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:41,193
There are things
people can do to, you know,

170
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:42,695
give us a chance to find you.

171
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:44,697
[Viktoria panting]
It's blocked.

172
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:46,156
Just wait.

173
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:47,491
Stop, stop.

174
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,742
I'll check ahead.

175
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,288
[man] Where are you going?

176
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:54,665
Viktoria!

177
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,710
Then, so,
look at the camera?

178
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:58,752
[reporter] No, just relax.

179
00:06:58,961 --> 00:06:59,962
Pretend it's not there.

180
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,965
No, heroism is usually
life-threatening

181
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,925
to the hero himself, you know?

182
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,970
So we're taught
to avoid heroic actions.

183
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,723
Our rescuers' main...
almost our guiding principle,

184
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,975
is not to increase
the number of injured.

185
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,311
Recently, our ratings
and efficiency

186
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,104
have improved so much
that we're at the point

187
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:19,023
where now the guard
redirects some of

188
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,983
the emergency calls they
get to our team.

189
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,236
- [heavy breathing]
- Here this way.

190
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:25,404
No need to rush anything.

191
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:26,572
You can take your time.

192
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:27,907
Here, take my hand.

193
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:28,991
Are you all right?

194
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,536
It's okay,
just a little crawlway.

195
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:33,370
Stay calm.

196
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,205
- I'm stuck here.
- I'm telling you, easy.

197
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,541
This guy here is called Yukon.

198
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,460
I rescued him
from his first owner

199
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,420
who unfortunately
died in a fire.

200
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,797
He's been trained
to search for people,

201
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,008
specifically living people.

202
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,885
Cadaver dogs are trained
differently than him.

203
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,428
So he doesn't do that.

204
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,430
He specializes in
finding the living.

205
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,933
Hang on, stop.
Your harness is stuck.

206
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,059
Go back just a bit.

207
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,185
Just a little bit.

208
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,269
That's right.

209
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,021
- That's it, good.
- Nice.

210
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,731
Now take a few breaths
and exhale.

211
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:02,566
You're good.

212
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,485
Breathe, out.

213
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:05,903
Breathe, out.

214
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:06,737
Strong exhales now.

215
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:07,821
Deep.

216
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,365
- Come on, here we go.
- Come on, come on.

217
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,199
- You're almost there.
- You got it.

218
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,492
- Just a bit more.
- Yeah.

219
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,911
- Just a bit, great.
- That's it.

220
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:14,912
Good job.

221
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:17,039
Congrats on
your very first climb.

222
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,082
You did it.

223
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,083
[reporter]
<i>Can you talk about the beacon?</i>

224
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay.

225
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,293
Ah, the beacon.

226
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,962
He wears this light-up beacon.

227
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:26,715
Uh, this is so we can track him
at dusk, in the dark, or fog,

228
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,927
anywhere there's low visibility
like in these caves.

229
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,096
All right, you got this.

230
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:33,555
Careful.

231
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,641
- Gripping it tight?
- [Viktoria] Mm-hm.

232
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,646
[reporter 2] <i>Time for a good
morning with some good news.</i>

233
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,147
[reporter 3] <i>Number one talk.</i>

234
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,524
[reporter 2] <i>Ex-president Trump
was indicted today...</i>

235
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:44,984
- I'm coming through.
- Sure, come on.

236
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,819
That's quite a lot of gear
you have.

237
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,280
Yeah, I'm doing a check
of the filming equipment.

238
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,574
[reporter 2] <i>...prostitution,
bribery, extortion,</i>

239
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,118
- <i>and the list goes on and on.</i>
- A little action cam?

240
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,036
[reporter] Mm-hm.
have a few of them.

241
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:57,663
You can wear them on your head.

242
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,081
- They're handy.
- Right.

243
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,126
This is the main camera,
I can record in total darkness.

244
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,377
Why are you by yourself?

245
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:04,545
I thought you had a cameraman.

246
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,339
He was assigned to another
project at the last minute.

247
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:08,549
What can I do?

248
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,010
I'm not gonna back out now,
am I? [chuckles]

249
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,095
Well, if you need something,
I'm around.

250
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,054
[door thuds]

251
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:15,055
I'll see you.

252
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,141
Would you help me?

253
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:18,892
Is the red light on?

254
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,602
- [Viktoria] Mm-hm.
- [man] Ready.

255
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,604
I'm Christina Arrifeva.

256
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,898
We're now watching the search
and rescue team ISCRA

257
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:26,567
train a new volunteer
on how to provide

258
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,152
first aid to injured persons

259
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:30,154
when they're found in
extreme environments,

260
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,989
and very soon,
many kilometers from here,

261
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,575
they'll hold their annual um...

262
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,912
I think I'll start with
the second part first, okay?

263
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,291
And, and, and let's turn around
to face the cave opening.

264
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,083
Come on.

265
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,918
We've been fortunate
to see in action

266
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,628
their new state-of-the-art
training system

267
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,213
that simulates lifelike wounds

268
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,757
such as the bleeding
and fractures

269
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,717
they will actually see
on the job.

270
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,761
Their goal here
is to practice in the field

271
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,679
for situations
that they'll be expected

272
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,389
to respond to in
alive emergency.

273
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,266

as well as the...

[man] <i>Hey, are you okay?</i>

276
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,104
[Christina]
<i>Yes, we're coming out.</i>

277
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,195
[man over radio]
<i>Andre, do you copy?</i>

278
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,488
[Andre over radio]
<i>Andre here.</i>

279
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,157
[man] <i>We have a missing boy
near your location.</i>

280
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,492
<i>14 years old.</i>

281
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,911
<i>He and his little brother
wandered into the forest.</i>

282
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,705
<i>The little brother
returned alone. Shocked.</i>

283
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,165
<i>Won't say a word.</i>

284
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,043
<i>If you guys could
wrap up your training,</i>

285
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,836
<i>you're our closest unit.</i>

286
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,923
<i>We're sending another group
but they're hours away.</i>

287
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:32,466
<i>Do you copy?</i>

288
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,219
- <i>Andre?</i>
- [Andre] <i>Copy, we got it.</i>

289
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,596
<i>I confirm,
we're taking your call.</i>

290
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:38,889
<i>We await the location.</i>

291
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:40,599
<i>Thanks. Over and out.</i>

[crow cawing]

295
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,800
[man] That's where the kids
crossed the road

296
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,135
and went into the forest.

297
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,845
They were last seen by loggers.

298
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,389
It's swamp land
with woods beyond that.

299
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,557
That's where we'll start.

300
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,268
It's such a huge search area,
how will we find him?

301
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:25,644
Where did he even come from?

302
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:26,937
There's no villages nearby.

303
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:27,771
[man] Look here.

304
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,231
Their village is
about 15 kilometers

305
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,816
to the south along the river.

306
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,777
A little further up here
is an old saw mill.

307
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:35,195
- Right.
- [man] If we zoom out,

308
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,614
we see this area here
is nothing but swamp.

309
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,534
That's really treacherous land
out there.

310
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,704
So they're looking at the map
and it seems the area

311
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,291
we're going into is going to be
difficult terrain.

312
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,169
- [engine rumbling]
- [dramatic music]

[dog whimpers]

314
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,255
Hey, Andre, drive safely,

315
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,590
- come on.
- You nearly killed the dog.

316
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,467
[Andre] There's no way to drive
safe, we're in a Russian car.

317
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,470
[dark dramatic music]

318
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,815
[engine rumbling]

319
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:13,692
[man] Right, that's the spot.

320
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,360
We'll set off
in about five minutes.

321
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:19,323
[birds calling]

322
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:21,992
Can you turn towards me?

323
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,785
Uh-huh.

324
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,162
Perfect. Beautiful.

325
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,456
[static buzzing]

326
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:28,332
- [Christina] Ilya.
- [Ilya] Huh?

327
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,625
[Christina] Where's the tablet?

328
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,084
[Ilya] It's here in the car.

329
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,795
[Christina] Listen, can you
turn it on for me please?

330
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,215
I need to check and see if
Viktoria has a working camera.

331
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,049
[Ilya] What do you need
that for?

332
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,594
Viktoria,
take a step towards me.

333
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:41,762
See, the red light's on.

334
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:42,596
It must be working.

335
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,431
[Christina] Come on, Ilya,
I'm not asking for much here.

336
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,600
- [Ilya] Fine.
- It just takes a second.

337
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,768
[Ilya] Just a moment.

338
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,311
Do you know what
the connection code is?

339
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,521
- [Christina] Um...
- [Ilya] Four zeros?

340
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,151
Damn, how many useless things
are in this van anyway?

341
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,277
Why do you have a gun?

342
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,905
A flare gun.
German made in the last century.

343
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,740
They knew how
to make some things. Heh.

344
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,033
- [Christina] Alexey.
- [Alexey] Huh?

345
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:03,909
What's this thing here?

346
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:04,785
Oh, that.

347
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,495
That's our searching siren.

348
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,163
We mount it
on the roof of the van

349
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:09,706
and it lets the lost person know

350
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:10,707
that we're looking for them.

351
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,627
[siren wailing]

352
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,467
[dramatic music]

353
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,989
[music continues]

354
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,712
[ominous music]

355
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,635
[Ilya] You guys, we're entering
the search zone now.

356
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,471
We're going to spread out
and call out his name, Nikita.

357
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,597
Listen for his response.

358
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,559
Nikita!

359
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,312
[Christina] Viktoria,
face the camera.

360
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,604
Shh.

361
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,235
[Christina whispers]
Is Yukon on the scent?

362
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:21,320
[Ilya] Not yet.

363
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,071
[Andre] Nikita!

364
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,495
[Ilya] Keep your eyes peeled.
Stay alert, people.

365
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,330
Pay attention.

366
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,335
[Christina] So, right now,
the search team is calling out

367
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,711
the missing boy's name.

368
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,462
[Andre] Nikita!

369
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,504
[Christina]
They're looking for signs

370
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,548
and listening
as we make our way through

371
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,175
the overgrown brush.

372
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,846
Nikita, hey!

373
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,186
The saw mill where the boy
was seen is north of here

374
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,812
and there's a path just ahead.

375
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,898
Let's go ahead
and split up here.

376
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,650
Why don't you give me Yukon
and we'll follow the trail.

377
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,820
- And you two, you and Viktoria.
- Mm-hm, okay.

378
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,280
Go check that path
right over there,

379
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,115
but make sure you stay
within sight of each other.

380
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,367
- Uh-huh.
- Make sure to stay

381
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,409
in each other's field of vision

382
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:10,243
- at all times, okay?
- Careful,

383
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,161
everyone watch their step.

384
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,287
Let's disperse now.

385
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,831
Remember to stay
close to each other.

386
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:15,791
Yukon.

387
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,627
[ominous music]

388
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,220
[Viktoria] Nikita!

389
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,017
[Alexey] Nikita!

390
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:36,728
The sun is setting.

391
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,272
It'll be dark soon.

392
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,608
[Viktoria] Nikita!

393
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:45,987
Listen, it's useless.

394
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,697
We're never going to
find anyone.

395
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:49,074
Why's that?

396
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,158
I'll tell you why.

397
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,661
Over the last three years
I've had over 100 missions

398
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,204
and I haven't found anyone yet.

399
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,163
I'm unlucky.

400
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:56,832
I'll be your good luck charm.

401
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,041
Beginner's luck, you know?

402
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,084
You think so?

403
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,335
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

404
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:01,962
Nikita!

405
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,798
[ominous music]

406
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:06,967
Alexey.

407
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,135
- Huh?
- You smell that?

408
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,178
What?

409
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:11,555
Something's burning.

410
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,559
I can't smell it.

411
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,018
I can't smell anything.

412
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,234
[suspenseful music]

413
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,333
[voice] <i>Will you play with me?</i>

414
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,627
[eerie music]

415
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,341
[Alexey] Viktoria.

416
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:53,013
[dark ominous music]

417
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,864
[rustling]

418
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,492
[dramatic music]

419
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,123
[rustling]

420
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,209
[suspenseful music]

421
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:25,545
Is it ready?

422
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,672
Keep her head above her legs.

423
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,675
We found an old woman
in the forest completely naked

424
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:31,968
- and apparently in shock.
- [Andre] Keep it steady.

425
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:32,719
- So far she hasn't...
- [Ilya] I got it.

426
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,429
[Christina] ...been able to
explain what happened to her.

427
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,891
She has no visible injuries
or wounds of any kind

428
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,726
and we were unable
to locate her clothes

429
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,019
- anywhere in the area.
- [Andre] Watch out.

430
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,646
[Christina] We also have
no explanation of why

431
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,731
there was a child's toy
found near her.

432
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,860
Here behind me here
you will see the rescuers

433
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:52,989
urgently transporting the woman
back to their vehicle.

434
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,618
And from there she will be taken
to the nearest hospital

435
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,827
as soon as possible.

436
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,829
As of now,
we still know nothing

437
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,373
about the boy's whereabouts.

438
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,874
- [thudding]
- [Christina gasping]

439
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,793
[Andre] Watch for the stones.
Mm-hm.

440
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,711
- [Christina] Hang on guys.
- [man] You need to be careful.

441
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,591
- [ominous music]
- [Christina whimpering]

442
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,846
- [dramatic music]
- Oh, God.

443
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:18,932
Come on, stand up.

444
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:23,228
[dramatic music]

445
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,988
- [woman groaning]
- Stop. She's convulsing.

446
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,239
[Andre] Put her down,
put her down now.

447
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,575
- [Alexey] Okay.
- Here, hold her head.

448
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,618
- [Alexey] Holding.
- [Andre] She's not breathing.

449
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,746
Hold her head. Hold it still.

450
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,582
Let's open her mouth
and have a look.

451
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,084
Christina, out of the way!

452
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,043
[Andre] Give me a second.

453
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,378
Let's see what's in her mouth.

454
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:49,921
There's something.

455
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:50,964
Ilya, light.

456
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,591
I'll try and pull it out.

457
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,052
- [dramatic music]
- [Andre groans]

458
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:56,845
[Alexey] The hell?

459
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:58,513
[Andre] Give me a knife.

460
00:18:58,722 --> 00:18:59,389
- I need a knife.
- [Ilya] A knife?

461
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:00,557
You'll break her teeth.

462
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,643
- [Andre] Open her mouth.
- [Ilya] I can't stop her.

463
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,729
- [Alexey] Mind her chin.
- [Andre groans]

464
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:06,605
[Ilya] Come on.

465
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:10,984
What the hell is that?

466
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,196
[woman coughing]

467
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,159
It looks like she's breathing.

468
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,327
- Looks like it.
- Wow.

469
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:28,168
[static buzzing]

470
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,755
This crazy lady
nearly bit my fingers off.

471
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,215
Come on, tighter.

472
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,760
I have another bandage
just in case.

473
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,722
She really did a number on me.

474
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:42,515
How is she?

475
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:43,475
I'll go check.

476
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,477
Ma'am, can you hear us?

477
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,520
[Andre] I hope she'll make it
to the hospital.

478
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:48,521
[Ilya] She'll be fine.

479
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,689
[Viktoria] Maybe we can give her
some medicine.

480
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,274
[Ilya] Seriously? We can't.

481
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:52,108
[Viktoria] Why not?

482
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,069
[Ilya] Because
you give her a pill,

483
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,695
or any kind of injection,

484
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,157
she might have an allergic
reaction or even overdose.

485
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,659
Then we end up in court.

486
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,952
[Andre] We're only allowed
to give them medication

487
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:03,870
if they have it on them.

488
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,498
Unfortunately,
the risk is just too great.

489
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,749
- Wrap it here.
- Mm-hm.

490
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,211
Alexey, what's up? Anything?

491
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,921
No, it's all bad out here.

492
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,255
The elevation's too low.

493
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,592
- [muffled yelling]
- [light dramatic music]

494
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,681
[ominous music]

495
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:26,518
You hear that?

496
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,188
[Andre] All right, guys,
it came from this direction.

497
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,649
Let's take the stretcher and
go see what's going on.

498
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,361
- [Ilya] Uh-huh.
- [Andre] Ilya, that way.

499
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:40,323
Watch out for these trees.

500
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:41,950
Careful, don't drop her.

501
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,703
- [muffled yelling]
- [Christina gasps]

502
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,788
Nikita!

503
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,498
Alexey, what the hell? Hang on.

504
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,668
- Alexey, Alexey!
- [Ilya] All right, let's move.

505
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,879
[ominous music]

506
00:20:56,715 --> 00:21:00,593
- [Christina panting]
- [branches snapping]

507
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:10,395
[Viktoria] Alexey.

508
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,856
[tree creaking]

509
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:15,275
There's nothing here.

510
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,110
Probably the trees
creaking in the wind.

511
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,905
So, now the team went off
on a dead end lead

512
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,950
at a time when every minute
that passes is critical.

513
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,744
- Ilya.
- [Ilya] Huh?

514
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,120
Come see.

515
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,289
Hm, interesting.

516
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:33,042
[ominous music]

517
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,503
[Viktoria] It looks like a frog.

518
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,006
Well, yeah,
but actually it's not a frog.

519
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,800
Back in the day,
villagers would leave symbols

520
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:44,179
on old dead tree trunks to
mark the way to a sacred place.

521
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:46,055
This one indicates
an evil place.

522
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,682
Here we have a pointed head.

523
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:52,312
This would typically indicate
some type of evil spirit.

524
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,648
However, this one's strange,
at least from what I'm seeing.

525
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,859
It looks like it has...

526
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:03,406
maybe deformed or crippled legs.

527
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,578
Villagers would tell you
it's not a good sign.

528
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:10,538
[Christina] That's bullshit.

529
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:11,956
[Andre] All right, team, enough.

530
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,666
Let's go, there's not much time.

531
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,421
Ready?

532
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,507
One, two, lift her up.

533
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:21,925
[Alexey] Done.

534
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,554
[Andre] Watch your step,
be careful.

535
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:27,555
[Alexey] Got it.

536
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,266
[tree creaking]

537
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:32,936
[gasps]

538
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,023
[Ilya] Are we going
the right way?

539
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,192
[Andre] It's easy to get lost
in place like this.

540
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,528
[Viktoria] Yeah, does anyone
have the feeling

541
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,112
we're going in circles?

542
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,406
For more than three hours
we've been on a rescue mission

543
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,075
to save a woman
we found in the forest.

544
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:48,743
The team's getting tired,

545
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,745
- but we continue moving.
- Please don't block us.

546
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,080
You've filmed enough.

547
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,916
Sometimes we walk for eight
hours before we do our jobs.

548
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:57,919
We're nearly there.

549
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,005
Easy, not so fast.

550
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:02,257
Higher.

551
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,384
- Uh-huh.
- Right, you got it.

552
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:05,468
Careful now.

553
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:06,219
Easy.

554
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:07,428
Down.

555
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:08,680
- Ilya.
- [Viktoria] Let's go

556
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:09,430
one at a time.

557
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,140
- Pull it toward me.
- It's stuck here.

558
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,102
- Damn it.
- [men grunting]

559
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:17,480
- Come on down.
- [Andre] Put it here.

560
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,025
- Here.
- Let's get her up in the van.

561
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,947
- Come on, lift.
- [men grunting]

562
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:28,116
Let's put something warm on her.

563
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,450
Push more, more.

564
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:33,746
She's breathing.

565
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:48,970
[light dramatic music]

566
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,014
So, guys,
I know it's not my business,

567
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:54,309
uh, but what are you gonna do
about the kid?

568
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,978
Are we not looking for him?

569
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:59,856
- [bear] <i>I'll be your friend.</i>
- [Ilya] Remember our rule?

570
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,276
We always secure
the first one we find.

571
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:04,569
Let's go.

572
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:07,989
[engine rumbling]

573
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:11,075
[dramatic music]

574
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,463
- [engine rumbling]
- [keys jingling]

575
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,975
[engine revving]

576
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:41,397
Shit.

577
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:46,819
[door thuds]

578
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,488
Oh, come on. We're stuck.

579
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:49,364
What is it?

580
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:50,907
We're sitting in the mud.

581
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,158
Give me some light.

582
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:02,085
Yeah, the rear axle's stuck.

583
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,795
Let's wedge
something against it.

584
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,964
I'll tell you when to push
and you'll lean into it,

585
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,382
- all right?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

586
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,467
[Viktoria]
Andre, should I also get out?

587
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:10,760
[Andre] No, stay with the woman.

588
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,303
- You're light as a bird.
- [door thuds]

589
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:13,763
Are you guys ready?

590
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,556
- Gas it.
- [engine rumbling]

591
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:23,815
[rattling]

592
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,775
Keep pushing, keep pushing!

593
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:27,485
- [engine revving]
- [mud sloshing]

594
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,115
How heavy is this thing?

595
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,533
Three tons at least.

596
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,495
[ominous music]

597
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:40,999
[Alexey] Did it move?

598
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,046
I'll get the towing strap.

599
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:48,715
We'll use the winch.

600
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,758
[shovel scraping]

601
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,301
Ilya, can you hit
the bright lights?

602
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,761
- Can't see shit.
- Sure.

603
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:00,977
Ready.

604
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:01,811
Will it hold?

605
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,397
Of course, we only have
one tow strap. It has to hold.

606
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:09,569
- [Alexey] We're hooked up.
- [whirring]

607
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,824
[tense music]

608
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,504
[Ilya] Get rid of those twigs,
we need something substantial.

609
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,839
Alexey, move.

610
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,133
You, two,
wedge it under the wheel.

611
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:34,177
We need some traction.

612
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:35,219
- You get it?
- [Alexey] Yeah.

613
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:36,721
- [Ilya] All right, step aside.
- [Alexey] Uh-huh.

614
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,431
[Ilya] We're towing, so step
back in case a strap snaps.

615
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,808
- We're out.
- [whirring]

616
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:50,693
We're moving.

617
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,449
Think we're good.

618
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,993
[engine rumbling]

619
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:01,913
[dramatic music]

620
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:32,777
[music continues]

621
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:43,496
[engine rumbling]

622
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:51,504
[Andre] What fresh hell is this?

623
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:54,423
Let's go have a look.

624
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,510
- [light clicks]
- [tense music]

625
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,224
[door thuds]

626
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:06,310
[door thuds]

627
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,694
[engine rumbling]

628
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,572
[Ilya]
Damn, road's completely blocked.

629
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:18,990
[Andre] This is shit.

630
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:20,908
I'll get the chainsaw.

631
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,037
[Christina] What's happening?

632
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,123
[Alexey] Don't worry.
We'll figure it out.

633
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:28,749
Just a detour.

634
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,044
[Andre] Wait in the van.

635
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:33,421
We'll saw it up.

636
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:34,922
No problem.

637
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,216
[woman coughing]

638
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,014
Don't worry.

639
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,099
Can you tell us
how you're feeling?

640
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,352
We're a rescue team.

641
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:51,522
We found you in the forest.

642
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,816
Don't worry, you're safe now.

643
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:56,110
You're in our rescue van.

644
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:59,363
I'm Viktoria,
and what is your name?

645
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:02,825
[woman]
Zoya. Give me some water.

646
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:04,827
- [saw sputtering]
- [Andre] Damn it.

647
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:06,996
[grunting]

648
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,959
[groaning]

649
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,629
[coughing]

650
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,424
None of you
will get out of here.

651
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,302
No one is allowed
to leave this place.

652
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,346
[groans]

653
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:25,514
Zoya, what do you mean?

654
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,726
[ominous music]

655
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:31,604
The lame widow,

656
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,106
she'll lead you around
in circles.

657
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:39,362
- [saw sputtering]
- [Andre grunting]

658
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,116
[Zoya] It was a long time ago,
before the war.

659
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:48,079
She was
Red Sophia Zurumokov's daughter.

660
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:53,042
She choked her husband to death,
they said.

661
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:56,879
The people would scream at her,

662
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,048
"Why did you murder
your husband?"

663
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:03,678
The mob came for her
and caught her.

664
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,430
They beat her and
broke both of her legs

665
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:07,890
with a metal rod.

666
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:09,767
[saw sputtering]

667
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:12,645
They stripped her and
rode her out in a wagon

668
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,356
and threw her naked
into a dark pit.

669
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,024
[lights clicking]

670
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,734
[ominous music]

671
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:21,404
- [Andre panting]
- [owl hooting]

672
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:22,989
What's that?

673
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:24,323
Everything's fine, don't worry.

674
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:25,491
Faulty wiring.

675
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,869
They let her drown
in that black ooze.

676
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,832
It was just before
Holy Virgins Day.

677
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:35,334
The old-timers say
that evil's lived

678
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,795
in that dark pit ever since.

679
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,339
[ominous music]

680
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,220
[birds calling]

681
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,515
[ground rustling]

682
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:51,100
Ilya?

683
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:56,939
[light dramatic music]

684
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,109
We all heard the stories
growing up

685
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,445
about a dead woman

686
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:06,907
wandering around at night
on her broken legs

687
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:10,703
and killing people,
always taking their clothes.

688
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:22,548
That's why people were always
afraid to go into these woods.

689
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,093
Where are those guys?

690
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,766
I tell you, that the lame widow
from rotten earth

691
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:34,018
will get her revenge.

692
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:37,521
She will get what she wants.

693
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,106
Get what?

694
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:44,945
They threw her
into that pit naked

695
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:51,077
eternally freezing.

696
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,955
[ominous music]

697
00:31:57,124 --> 00:32:01,712
The widow won't allow anyone
to leave this forest alive.

698
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:07,093
[dramatic music]

699
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,969
[Andre grunts] It's no use.

700
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,640
[Alexey]
That's one hell of a story.

701
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:15,393
Hey lady, how about
you get some sleep, huh?

702
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:16,310
[doors thudding]

703
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,729
All right,
the situation's pretty bad.

704
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,148
I haven't been in something
like this.

705
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,442
The road is completely blocked.

706
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:24,944
Not sure what to do.

707
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:26,320
Chainsaw's dead.

708
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:28,280
Can we take a detour?

709
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:29,657
- Ilya?
- [Ilya] Yeah.

710
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,867
There's an option. A side road.

711
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,287
This logging path
leads to the forest highway.

712
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,541
We should end up approximately
back where we started.

713
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,000
And if we get lost again?

714
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,752
Can't we just start driving?
Anywhere?

715
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:42,753
- Come on.
- We won't get lost again.

716
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,755
As long as we find the path,
we're good.

717
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,924
[engine sputtering]

718
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:50,386
The car's not starting.

719
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:55,558
[engine sputtering]

720
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,611
- [keys jingling]
- [engine sputtering]

721
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,077
[engine rumbling]

722
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:16,620
All right, here we go.

723
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:17,913
Ilya, the tablet.

724
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,792
[engine rumbling]

725
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,047
[dramatic music]

726
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,414
There's no fork here on the map,
God damn it.

727
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,249
[door thuds]

728
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:12,760
Now will you admit
that we're lost?

729
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,094
You might be right.

730
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:15,763
[Viktoria]
I'll go check this way.

731
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,056
We never go alone.

732
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:18,015
- Alexey.
- [Alexey] Huh?

733
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:19,308
- Go with Viktoria.
- [Alexey] Uh-huh.

734
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:20,476
I'll check this path.

735
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:22,269
Ilya, will you help me?

736
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:23,395
- Hold the camera.
- Okay.

737
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:24,772
Let's go. Be careful.

738
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,946
It on? We good?

739
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:33,155
- Yeah, we're good.
- All right.

740
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,281
Let's go.

741
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,159
It's less than an hour
before October the 14th.

742
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:41,413
In folklore, that day is also
known as the Holy Virgins Day.

743
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,123
It's a day that
our ancestors believed

744
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,458
to be the scariest night
of the year.

745
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,877
It's the last chance for
evil spirits to commit horrors

746
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,379
before they hibernate
until spring.

747
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:50,548
Of course now we understand
a lot of the things

748
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,341
that inspired legends
in the past.

749
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:56,136
However, I have to say,
when you're deep in the forest

750
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:58,097
like this
you feel inclined to take

751
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,557
<i>the tales more seriously.</i>

752
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,225
[Alexey sighs]
Can you believe this shit?

753
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,726
[ominous music]

754
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,019
What are we doing here?

755
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,522
[Viktoria] We're saving a person
who was in distress.

756
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:07,773
[Alexey] Yeah, you're right.

757
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:10,109
Let's hope we're not the ones
that need saving.

758
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:11,402
[Viktoria] What's that?

759
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,320
[Alexey] I don't know,
it looks like a haystack.

760
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,157
[Viktoria] It's pretty weird.

761
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:35,009
[ominous music]

762
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,385
Look, there's another one.

763
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,970
[Alexey]
Where did they come from?

764
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:41,140
It's creepy out here,
do you wanna go back?

765
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:42,725
Yeah, let's go.

766
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:48,606
[Viktoria sighs]

767
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:54,737
[horn honking]

768
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,615
[Andre] Ilya, Alexey, come back!

769
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,742
Found the right road!

770
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,078
[light dramatic music]

771
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:09,418
[engine rumbling]

772
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,422
[ominous music]

773
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,723
[engine idling]

774
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:25,559
[door thuds]

775
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:27,936
[Andre] Well, how deep is it?

776
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:29,355
It should be fine.

777
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,440
Just make sure to drive slowly.

778
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:32,483
What do you mean drive slowly?

779
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,984
We're gonna speed
right through it.

780
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,366
[engine rumbling]

781
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,496
[water splashing]

782
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,418
[beeping]

783
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,590
[Christina] Is she breathing?

784
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:57,800
[Alexey] I think so.

785
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:02,471
Andre, that's too fast.

786
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,555
The road's a mess.

787
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:07,393
I don't know about you, but
I can't be out here all night.

788
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,311
I have a wife waiting for me.

789
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:10,312
- Andre!
- Andre, stop!

790
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:11,438
[grunting]

791
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,026
[Andre] Everyone all right?

792
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:17,319
[Ilya] My door is stuck.

793
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,029
[Alexey] The heck was that?

794
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,281
[Andre] Yeah, well I thought
it was a bear.

795
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:22,908
[Viktoria] You're kidding me.

796
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:24,201
[Andre] I'll check it out.

797
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,453
[Yukon whining]

798
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:27,663
[barking]

799
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:28,622
[Alexey] Yukon, stop.

800
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:29,456
Stop!

801
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,376
[Yukon barks]

802
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,586
- Yukon!
- [barking]

803
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:35,462
Yukon!

804
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:36,296
What is it?

805
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:37,798
[sighs] Maybe he found the boy.

806
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:38,632
Let's go.

807
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:40,634
[barking continues in distance]

808
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,430
[Andre] Christina, stop!

809
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:45,264
What now?

810
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:46,056
[Andre] Stay here.

811
00:37:46,724 --> 00:37:47,266
But why?

812
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:48,851
Because I need your help.

813
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,150
How exactly am I gonna help?

814
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,359
I'm going to show you.

815
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:00,988
Zoya, how are you?

816
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,281
I'm alive.

817
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,202
[Alexey] <i>Yukon!</i>

818
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:09,496
[Ilya] So why didn't Yukon
smell Zoya back there?

819
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:10,497
Sorry?

820
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,709
Well, you said he sniffs out
people who are alive.

821
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,252
Yeah, hell if I know.

822
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:17,755
[Yukon whining]

823
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,174
- Uh-huh.
- [whining continues]

824
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,431
[ominous music]

825
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:29,391
Oh, Lord.

826
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:30,642
What do you want?

827
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,644
I wanted to join you.

828
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,188
But Andre asked you to stay.

829
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,607
- He let me go.
- Mm-hm.

830
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:37,900
Better stay close.

831
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:41,904
[Alexey] Yukon!

832
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:44,490
[Ilya] Careful,
watch out for branches.

833
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:45,616
[Alexey] Yukon!

834
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:46,867
[Ilya] Don't poke an eye out.

835
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:47,826
- [Alexey] Move faster.
- [Christina] This isn't

836
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:50,287
- my first time walking here.
- How slow are you?

837
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:54,291
[Christina] This woman,
all naked, the lost boy.

838
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:58,086
And... and why was a haystack
in the middle of the road?

839
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,713
[Ilya] Some kind of witchcraft.

840
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:02,299
Well, naked people
have been found here before.

841
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,802
I've been involved in
two cases of it.

842
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:07,304
Are you serious?

843
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,515
Yeah, in one of the cases...

844
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:10,516
Hang on, wait.

845
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,059
I'll switch this on.

846
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:13,602
All right, it's working.

847
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,270
[rattling]

848
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,160
[panting]

849
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:31,537
[light dramatic music]

850
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,497
Hey, Christina,
can you pass me the wrench?

851
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,210
[rattling]

852
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:40,462
Damn it.

853
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,047
Christina?

854
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:46,927
Here you go.

855
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:48,428
Uh-huh.

856
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:51,265
[dramatic music]

857
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:54,560
[Andre grunts]

858
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:58,355
And where's Christina?

859
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,399
She joined the guys
like five minutes ago.

860
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:05,571
So, several years ago they
found a logger's body out here.

861
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:06,864
He was completely naked.

862
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:09,741
After he was back
to his village, his home,

863
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,577
he ended up choking to death.

864
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:14,162
Actually, it's more like
he drowned in mud.

865
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,664
He had mud everywhere.

866
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,375
In his mouth, his nose.

867
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:19,835
It looked as if
he was digging the ground

868
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,044
with both of his hands.

869
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,422
We could see where he was
shoveling it and even eating it.

870
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,548
And when was the second case?

871
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:25,716
Today.

872
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,134
[Alexey] Hey, guys!

873
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:29,303
Enough chit chat.

874
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,388
I found a trace.

875
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,683
- Come on, start.
- [engine sputtering]

876
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,477
Come on, start.

877
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,107
Do you think they're
going for the missing boy?

878
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:43,942
They're not gonna find shit
out there.

879
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:45,444
We just need to get outta here.

You don't know
what you've done.

929
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,582
No one's getting out.

930
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,501

Zoya's dangerous.

We can't get through.

We have to get out of
this lowland.

We can't spend the night.

Pass the GoPro.

Wait, it's showing two cameras.

[Ilya] That's weird.

Do you think it's Viktoria's?

1142
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,538
Maybe it was saved
in the memory?

1143
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:43,539
Maybe.

1144
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:45,416
It could have.

there, too.

She's a witch.

She performs some
kind of rituals there, I saw it.

1214

you feeling right now?

Are you feeling dizzy
or nauseated?

- just a quick word.
- [Christina] No, not happening.

She's going to kill us all.

Listen, do you think that
you could find that house again?

1233
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,076
If she really is a witch
like you say,

1234
01:03:49,285 --> 01:03:51,203
and if we can come away with
some evidence of this,

1235
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:52,413
