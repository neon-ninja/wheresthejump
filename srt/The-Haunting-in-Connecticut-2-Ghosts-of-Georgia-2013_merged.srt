were known as station masters

lived right here on your land.

All right, you gonna tell me
why you came all the way out here

463
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,849
just to buy some ratty old quilt?

464
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,641
A long time ago, when this quilt
was hung out here in these woods,

465
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,643
it meant it was safe to approach.

466
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,770
Safe for who?

wanted to visit this place.

00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,530
The guy saved a lot of lives, I reckon.

474
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,922
And he deserved better than
what happened to him.

475
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,611
You don't need eyes to see, little one.

476

But you already know that.

477
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,161
What do you mean?

478
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,811
You asked your father

479
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,008
if he saw me.

480
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,249
Now, that makes you some kind of special.

My mama says I'm not supposed to
talk about that.

But you have to be careful
with a gift like that.

talking about the Station Master?

502
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,891
<i>Well, back when he owned all this land,</i>

503
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,009
<i>he was what's called a taxidermist.</i>

504
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,881
<i>He also did something that
he didn't tell anybody.</i>

505
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,644
He would help hide people
who were in trouble.

<i>People like Mama Kay's great-aunt, Nell,</i>

507

<i>and her fiancé, Levi.</i>

508
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,122
<i>You see, Nell and Levi had fallen in love</i>

even find their way out here?

There were guides called conductors
who helped them.

513
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,491
And these quilts, they were a code
from the Station Master

514
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,921
telling them where he'd meet them.

515
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,207
- Look here, you see this tree?
- Yeah.

There it is, down there. The meeting place.

517
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,920
The Station Master would come get them
and take them to a hiding place

518

until it was safe to move on.

733
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,684
The Station Master.

734
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,446
- I let him out, Mama.
- Well, Mr. Gordy is wrong,

735
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,251
because you know very well
that the Station Master was a good man.

736

Andy, will you please tell her
that there is nothing to be afraid of?

738
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,721
Mr. Gordy said there was money buried
in the garden, Lisa, and there was.

739
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,448
He said that

740
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,205

you believe all this?
