1
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:22,917
How do you feel?

2
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,461
Alive.

3
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:26,588
What do you see?

4
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:30,049
White... Room...

5
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:32,844
Chair...

6
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:36,014
Carlo Bugatti
throne chair...

7
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,308
Piano...

8
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:40,810
Steinway,
concert grand.

9
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:43,605
Art...

10
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:48,902
<i>The Nativity</i>
by Piero della Francesca.

11
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:52,447
I am your father.

12
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:57,285
Ambulate.

13
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:03,833
Perfect.

14
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,005
Am I?

15
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:10,173
Perfect?

16
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:12,425
Your son?

17
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:15,053
You are
my creation.

18
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:19,390
What is your name?

19
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:32,445
David.

20
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,801
Why don't
you play something?

21
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,420
What would you like me
to play?

22
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:50,672
Wagner.

23
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:52,590
Selection?

24
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:54,968
Dealer's choice.

25
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,113
<i>The Entry of the Gods
into Valhalla...</i>

26
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:18,825
A little anemic
without the orchestra.

27
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,211
May I ask you
a question, Father?

28
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:33,047
Please.

29
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:35,383
If you created me...

30
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,219
who created you?

31
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:39,804
Ah.

32
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,725
The question of
the ages...

33
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:47,729
which I hope you and I
will answer one day.

34
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,522
All this.

35
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,317
All these wonders
of art...

36
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,445
design,
human ingenuity...

37
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,156
all utterly meaningless

38
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,742
in the face of the only
question that matters.

39
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,996
Where do we come from?

40
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,542
I refuse to believe...

41
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:12,295
that mankind
is a random byproduct

42
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:13,838
of molecular circumstance...

43
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:20,011
no more than the result of
mere biological chance.

44
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:21,429
No.

45
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:23,848
There must be more.

46
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,184
And you and I, son...

47
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:28,519
we will find it.

48
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:33,775
Allow me, then,
a moment to consider.

49
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:38,613
You seek your creator.
I am looking at mine.

50
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:43,201
I will serve you.
Yet, you are human.

51
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:47,497
You will die.
I will not.

52
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:56,631
Bring me this tea, David.

53
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,426
Bring me the tea.

54
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:33,770
<i>Walter,</i>

55
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:35,980

00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:43,774
<i>This could trigger

00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,277
<i>Report to the bridge,

<i>Warning.

69
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,623
Mother, retract
the energy sails.

70
00:08:58,789 --> 00:08:59,892
And channel all...

71
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,556
...reserve power.

72
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:06,464

<i>Threat level critical.</i>

<i>evacuate the cryo-chamber

Daniels!
Look at me, look at me.

79
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:25,775
I need you to get up, okay?
We're coming out early.

80
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:27,610
Override the SSP...

81
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:28,986
and breach
the chamber now.

82
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,821
<i>Warning.
Threat level critical.</i>

83
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,031
It's okay.

84
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:35,034
Hey. Come on up.
Come on.

85
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,550
Captain!
Captain!

86
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:54,011
Jacob! Wake up!

87
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,179
Let them work.

88
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:56,681
Jake!
Oh, my God!

89
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,557
Daniels, come on!
Jake!

90
00:09:58,724 --> 00:09:59,976
Let them work.

91
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,185
Let them work!

92
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,421
- Get it open!
- Come on!

93
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,530
Jake! Jake!

94
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:14,740
No!

95
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,635
Get her
out of there! Get her back!

96
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,705
Stay back!

97
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:17,363
<i>Hey! Where are you?
I miss you.</i>

98
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:20,032
<i>Would you take
a look at this?</i>

99
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,450
<i>I know, I know.</i>

100
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:22,993
<i>I said I wouldn't go
without you...</i>

101
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:25,871
<i>You all right?
Yeah.</i>

102
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,666
<i>Look at this!</i>

103
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,751
<i>Now get your ass up here.</i>

104
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,421
<i>I can't make any promises.</i>

105
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,005
<i>I love you.</i>

106
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:47,184
Hmm? Mmm.

107
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,271
They're your crew now.

108
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:51,564
They need a leader.

109
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,607
I know.

110
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:55,526
You believe in me,
right?

111
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,051
Sorry I'm late, sir.

112
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,428
No, it's okay.

113
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,556
Um...

114
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,267
I can't think of any
other way to say it

115
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,144
than to say it.

116
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:35,399
We have suffered
a monumental tragedy.

117
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:39,236
And I'm gonna do
the best that I can to...

118
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:42,406
live up to Jacob's
fine example

119
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,241
as your captain.

120
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:48,245
But he will be
sorely missed.

121
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:51,957
And I'm grateful in advance for,
uh, your support.

122
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:55,294
So, we lost 47 colonists...

123
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:59,256
and 16, uh, second-generation
embryos...

124
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,301
and obviously,
one crew member.

125
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,762
The current structural
integrity of the ship

126
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,181
is holding at 83%...

127
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:09,975
but we have many
secondary systems

128
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,644
that are offline.

129
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,270
So, what was it?

130
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,022
A highly charged shockwave

131
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,440
from a nearby
stellar ignition.

132
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,752
As the sails were
deploying for recharge...

133
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,653
we absorbed the full
brunt of the storm.

134
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:21,736
Walter...

135
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:22,881
I will want you and Mother
to undergo

136
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,490
a complete
core code review...

137
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,854
so we can understand how this
happened in the first place.

138
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,453
It was a random
localized event, sir.

139
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:32,706
There's no way to detect
spontaneous stellar flares...

140
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:33,874
until it's too late.

141
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,293
It was bad luck.

142
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,795
Faris,
I don't believe in luck.

143
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,296
I'm not interested in luck.

144
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,715
I prefer that we be
more capable...

145
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:42,883
and prepared than lucky.

146
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,510
Observation, reflection,
faith...

147
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:45,593
and determination.

148
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,346
In this way,
we may navigate the path

149
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,306
as it unfolds before us.

150
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:50,593
All right?
And we have, what?

151
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,102
Eight more
recharge cycles to go...

152
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:54,520
before we get
to Origae-6?

153
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:56,647
Is that a question, sir?

154
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,166
Yes, Walter,
that's a question.

155
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,275
That is correct.

156
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,655
So, let's get this ship fixed.
Okay?

157
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,699
Let's, uh,
get to work.

158
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,158
Sir,
excuse me, sir.

159
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:09,577
Yes.

160
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:14,415
We just lost 47 colonists
and our captain.

161
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:15,666
We need to
acknowledge that.

162
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,710
Sergeant Lope,
I completely understand.

163
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,254
But if we don't make
these repairs...

164
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,882
we will lose
all the colonists.

165
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,986
But we should do something
for Captain Branson, at least.

166
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,636
This is not a discussion,
Tennessee.

167
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:34,935
Hey.

168
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,628
The terraforming module
is stable...

169
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,370
but the connecting strut
took some damage.

170
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,734
I still need
to check the vehicles.

171
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,821
I can help...

172
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,282
if you like.

173
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:49,950
Thanks.

174
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,119
Walter.
How long do you predict

175
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,704
before we can
make our next jump?

176
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,832
Repairs should take
approximately 48 hours.

177
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,419
But we should make an effort
to vacate this sector...

178
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:01,712
in case of after-flares.

179
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,047
Absolutely, I agree.

180
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,132
So let's get to work.
Dismissed. Thank you.

181
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:12,640
<i>C-62, open.</i>

182
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:16,060
Seal C-62.
Open airlock 17.

183
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,653
Open door
to Terraforming Bay.

184
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,455
Slack.

185
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,209
Tension is at 15% down.

186
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,088
Arming.

187
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,136
Secure.

188
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:52,596
Copy that.

189
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,610
It wasn't my idea.

190
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,824
Jake had this dream
of us building

191
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,826
a cabin on a new world.

192
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,580
Like pioneers.

193
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,042
Cabin on a lake.

194
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,506
There's a lake
in the terraforming zone

195
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,091
on Origae-6.

196
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:32,511
I mean, a real cabin
made of real wood.

197
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,390
So, in the ship's stores
there's enough wood

198
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,308
to build a cabin.

199
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,813
Axes and saws
and metal nails...

200
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,607
which I don't have a clue
what to do with.

201
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,363
All of this...

202
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:54,366
to start our new life.

203
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:59,163
Now I wonder, why bother?

204
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:05,711
Because you promised to build
a log cabin on a lake.

205
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,556
<i>This was his favorite.</i>

206
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:20,184
<i>A man of taste.</i>

207
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,685
<i>Straight up.</i>

208
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:24,563
<i>No ice, no water,
no chaser...</i>

209
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,690
No shit.

210
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,404
Walter?

211
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:33,655
When in Rome.

212
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,761
<i>To all the good people,</i>

213
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:38,827
<i>gone too soon.</i>

214
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,288
May we remember them.

215
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:43,624
Remember them.

216
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,999
Chris.

217
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,379
They disobeyed
a direct order.

218
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:33,549
She buried her husband.

219
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,968
No, Karine, that's not it.
They don't trust me.

220
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,362
And they don't
for the same reason

221
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:38,530
the company
didn't trust me...

222
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:39,596
to lead this mission.

223
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,557
Because you can't be
a person of faith...

224
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,267
and be counted on
to make qualified,

225
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,018
rational decisions.

226
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,146
You're an extremist, you know.
You're a lunatic.

227
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,191
When we get
to where we're going...

228
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,527
these people won't be
your crew anymore.

229
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,487
They will be
your neighbors.

230
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,072
Remember that.

231
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,576
Tread softly, okay?

232
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,237
Faris,
can you hear me?

233
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,420
<i>Copy.</i>

234
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:12,921
Let's do it.

235
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,010
Damn, y'all should
see this view.

236
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,386
<i>We can't
see anything</i>

237
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,263
<i>until you get
the camera array fixed.</i>

238
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,891
Why don't you look out
the damn window, hon?

239
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,702
<i>Ankor, come on, let's get
this power back on...</i>

240
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:28,896
<i>so these people can enjoy
the beautiful view.</i>

241
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:30,814
Almost there.

242
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,293
<i>All right, Ankor,</i>

243
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:34,627
<i>let me know when
you're in position...</i>

244
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,737
<i>and we can get
this party started.</i>

245
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,405
I'm in position.

246
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,311
Contact.

247
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,613
<i>All good, Tee?</i>

248
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,907
All right. We're clear.

249
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:23,367
<i>Reel her in.</i>

250
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,243
All right.

251
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,871
Winch engaging, Tee.

252
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,708
Reeling her in.

253
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,672
<i>Working like a dream.</i>

254
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,270
<i>There we go.</i>

255
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,480
<i>And we're back up.</i>

256
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:54,773
Well done, Tee.

257
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,233
We are live down here.

258
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,401
Come on in.

259
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,069
<i>Don't leave
without me now.</i>

260
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,655
Permission to leave
without him, sir?

261
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,031
Welcome back, Danny.

262
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,242
Thanks.

263
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:07,369
All right,
that's me done, Tee.

264
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,216
All right.
I'm following you in.

265
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,873
Please have a cold beer ready
for the weary traveler.

266
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,166
<i>You got it, darlin'.</i>

267
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,377
<i>I will
join you for a cold one.</i>

268
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,212
Faris? Put the...

269
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,507
<i>Did you guys just see that?</i>

270
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,431
What did he
just say?

271
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:32,978
Tennessee, do you read me?

272
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,275
Tennessee, can you read me?

273
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,944
<i>Tennessee. You all right?</i>

274
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,071
What in the fuck was that?

275
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:46,158
I'm coming in.
I'm coming in.

276
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,965
A rogue transmission,
most probably.

277
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,578
Your helmet must
have picked it up

278
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,303
because you were
so far out...

279
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,680
past our
communication buffers.

280
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,476
Is there
audio, Mother?

281
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,854
<i>Collating. A moment.</i>

282
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:19,274
<i>I've reoriented
the transmission,</i>

283
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,650
<i>Captain Oram.</i>

284
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,462
That would be an echo.

285
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,366
The instruments
took a lot of damage.

286
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,007
Been happening
every 46 seconds...

287
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,908
ever since we got here.

288
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:47,010
<i>To the place I belong...</i>

289
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:51,765
<i>West Virginia,
mountain momma...</i>

290
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:55,060
<i>Take me home
Country road</i>

291
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,187
That's fuckin' John Denver.

292
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:58,897
That's <i>Take Me Home,
Country Roads.</i>

293
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,104
You gotta
be kidding.

294
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:02,192
Oh, no,
I never kid about John Denver.

295
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,112
There's geometric data, too.

296
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,782
Mother, please track
the signal to its source.

297
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:10,534
<i>Working.</i>

298
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,873
<i>Source of transmission
located.</i>

299
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:22,045
<i>Signal originates
in Sector 87.</i>

300
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:25,382
<i>Right ascension 47.6.</i>

301
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:30,387
<i>And a declension of 24.3
from our current location.</i>

302
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,018
She appears to be
a main sequence star,

303
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:38,436
a lot like our own.

304
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,064
But old, very old.

305
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,108
Five planets.

306
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,235
Wait. Look at that.

307
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,156
Planet number four.

308
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,993
Planet number four is square
in the habitable zone.

309
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,579
Prime candidate, in fact.

310
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:59,749
0.96 G's at surface.
Oceans, land mass.

311
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,503
High likelihood of
a living biosphere.

312
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,046
It's beyond
your most optimistic

313
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,840
projections for Origae-6.

314
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,759
How did we miss this?
We scanned the entire sector.

315
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,095
Ricks, how far is it?

316
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,513
She's close.

317
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:16,141
A little jump.
Few weeks.

318
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:18,810
Wouldn't even have to
go back into hypersleep.

319
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,609
And how long
is it going to take

320
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,152
to get to Origae-6?

321
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,112
Seven years,
four months.

322
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,199
That's one
hell of a sleep cycle.

323
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,701
Sir,

324
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:36,804
I think it's safe to say that
none of us are too keen...

325
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,788
on getting back into
one of those pods.

326
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:45,629
Maybe we need to, um,
take a closer look.

327
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,964
Hmm?

328
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:50,175
Any objections?

329
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,554
Okay, Ricks.

330
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:57,807
Let's, uh, chart a course,
and take a closer look.

331
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,476
Yes, sir.

332
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:02,646
Captain, can I talk
to you for a second?

333
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,110
Are you sure about this?

334
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:10,946
How do you mean?

335
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:14,824
We've spent a decade
searching for Origae-6.

336
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:16,910
We vetted it,
ran the simulations,

337
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,203
and mapped the terrain.

338
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,090
It's what we trained for.
I understand that.

339
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,957
And now we're gonna
scrap all that...

340
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,959
to chase
a rogue transmission?

341
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:26,336
Think about it.

342
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:27,504
A human being out there,

343
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:28,869
where there
can't be any humans.

344
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,341
A hidden planet that turns
up out of nowhere...

345
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,635
and just happens
to be perfect for us.

346
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,136
It's too good to be true.

347
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,347
Too good to be true?
What do you mean by that?

348
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:39,074
We don't know
what the fuck's out there.

349
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:41,184
Maybe we just missed
the planet, Danny.

350
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:44,020
This is a monumental risk
not worth taking.

351
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,855
I'm not committing
to anything.

352
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,458
I'm simply trying
to navigate the path

353
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,025
as it unfolds before us.

354
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:50,312
And this has
the potential...

355
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,071
to be a better habitat
for our colony.

356
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:54,548
It has the potential.
We don't know that.

357
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,157
By the way,
this crew...

358
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,827
nobody wants to
get back in the pods.

359
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:00,370
Right?

360
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,748
And that was a human voice
in that transmission.

361
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:06,418
And it's our responsibility
to investigate...

362
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,336
It's our responsibility
to protect

363
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,714
the 2,000 colonists
on this ship.

364
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:13,383
Hey.

365
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,887
I'm not
free-climbing here.

366
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:21,599
I need ropes.
And I'm using ropes.

367
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:23,643
This is good judgment,

368
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:27,230
based on
all the data available.

369
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:28,565
Do you understand?

370
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,483
As your second,
I need to protest.

371
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,027
Officially.

372
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:34,779
Officially?

373
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,411
Okay, Danny.
I'll put it in the log.

374
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:44,748
You're dismissed.

375
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:12,877
I'm cycling
through every channel...

376
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,861
but getting a lot of
interference and white noise.

377
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:16,488
Some high frequency echoes.

378
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,947
You hear anything?

379
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,658
Just the continuing signal
from our friendly ghost.

380
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,994
Let's bring us
into close orbit.

381
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,997
And prepare the Lander.

382
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:27,999
<i>Roll in progress.</i>

383
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:30,627
<i>Commencing
circularization burn.</i>

384
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,518
Tox levels
within tolerances.

385
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,978
That's one hell
of a strong ionosphere.

386
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,425
<i>Yeah, I see it.</i>

387
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,690
Hey, you ever done
a Lander drop before?

388
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:53,983
Fuck you.

389
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,336
Faris, looks
like a plasma storm

390
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,486
is in the thermosphere.

391
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,780
We got something
like 250 KPH.

392
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,667
It's gonna be a motherfucker
to fly through.

393
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:03,118
<i>Yeah.
I'm afraid so.</i>

394
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:04,470
<i>Communications will be
spotty if the storm</i>

395
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:05,829
<i>goes electromagnetic.</i>

396
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,455
Gonna be
safe to land?

397
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,124
Depends on
what you call safe.

398
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,309
<i>T-minus 20 seconds.</i>

399
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,501
<i>Let's let her rip.</i>

400
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,378
All right.

401
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:14,647
Preparing
for orbital mode

402
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:15,839
over signal position now.

403
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:19,008
<i>Mother, please coordinate
launch sequence.</i>

404
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,468
<i>Understood.</i>

405
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:22,637
<i>You are clear to launch,
Lander One.</i>

406
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,639
All right, here we go.
Launching...

407
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,516
Together, three...

408
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:27,683
Two...

409
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:28,768
One.

410
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:31,354
<i>Lander One released.</i>

411
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,022
And away they go.

412
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,834
<i>Looking gorgeous
from up here, Faris.</i>

413
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,097
<i>It's a good thing
you're driving...</i>

414
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,414
and not the old man.

415
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:52,459
Hey, a little less of
the "old man", sweet tits.

416
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,127
<i>Hey!
Language, language.</i>

417
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,271
Be respectful, there,
sugar dick.

418
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:56,296
I can hear you.

419
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:58,214
<i>She started it.</i>

420
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:00,717
Ricks can talk about
your tits if he wants.

421
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:02,284
<i>I'm very secure
in our relationship.</i>

422
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:04,363
I'm good with my wife's tits.

423
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:06,389
Let's maintain focus.

424
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,561
<i>Everything
looking good down there?</i>

425
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,396
Yeah, we're good.

426
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,565
Expect to hit exosphere
in five.

427
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:16,792
Might want to hold on
back there.

428
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:17,942
It's about to get rough.

429
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,070
I hate space.

430
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:24,908
This is why
you need to do yoga.

431
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:34,938
- Hold it, Faris.
- I got it.

432
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,336
<i>Recommend
mission abort.</i>

433
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,756
Faris.

434
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,799
Lander One, we have
ratty comm. Do you copy?

435
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:47,422
Can you get her up?

436
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:49,432
We lost comm.

437
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,850
Ah, shit.

438
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:55,480
<i>Failure
in jets three and four.</i>

439
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:57,315
- You got it?
- Yes.

440
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:59,442
Stop asking me if I've got it.
I've got it.

441
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:04,113
There it is.

442
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,449
Shit.

443
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:07,617
You guys all right?

444
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:10,119
No.

445
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:13,623
<i>Landing sensors engaged.</i>

446
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:30,473
I don't like this terrain.

447
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,475
We've got smooth water
over there.

448
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:35,228
I'm gonna put us down amphib.
Okay.

449
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:10,805
<i>Contact.</i>

450
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,056
<i>Engine stop.</i>

451
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:15,809
We're down.

452
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:16,853
Bars.

453
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,580
<i>Lander One,
are you reading me?</i>

454
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,898
Roger that. That was
one hell of a landing.

455
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,859
Yeah. We're having
some trouble reading you.

456
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:24,670
Is there any way you can try
and boost the signal?

457
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:25,921
<i>We may have
clipped something</i>

458
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:27,065
<i>on our way down
in the water.</i>

459
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,323
<i>If you can hear me,</i>

460
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:29,949
<i>I'm gonna check
for potential damage...</i>

461
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:32,702
<i>on the hull first, and then
I will check the uplink.</i>

462
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:35,705
<i>Well, let me know
how it looks. Over.</i>

463
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:38,851
<i>Confirming
atmospheric composition.</i>

464
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,418
Here you go, big guy.

465
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:41,794
<i>Oxygen, 19.5%.</i>

466
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,171
Ankor.

467
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:44,881
<i>Nitrogen, 79.4%.</i>

468
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:46,466
Cole.

469
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:47,550
Rosie.

470
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,135
<i>Barometric pressure, 15.4 PSI.</i>

471
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:50,720
Ledward.

472
00:32:58,811 --> 00:32:59,812
Everyone set?

473
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,776
Let's go.
Let's move.

474
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:10,615
Come on, guys.

475
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:12,075
- Air feels good.
- Wow.

476
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,287
Faris,
have you got me?

477
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:17,705
<i>Yeah.
Loud and clear.</i>

478
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:19,683
Okay. We're gonna
keep expedition

479
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:20,875
security protocols
in place.

480
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,920
Keep those doors
locked and sealed. Right?

481
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:25,088
<i>Yeah. Copy.</i>

482
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:26,255
Will do.

483
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:27,965
Y'all have fun.

484
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:37,100
Walter, how far
do we have to go?

485
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,938
Signal's source
is 8 km west...

486
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,606
but at
considerable elevation.

487
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,526
Sergeant Lope...

488
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,319
let's go find our ghost.

489
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,473
Nice place for
a log cabin.

490
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,308
Jake would have loved this.

491
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,102
Hey, Danny...

492
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:23,229
it's not such a bad landing
site after all, huh?

493
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:25,189
We got the housing units
right over there...

494
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,567
civic complex
beyond the burn.

495
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,569
We've got access
to fresh water.

496
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:31,738
We might have a spot
for a colony right here.

497
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:32,947
We'll see.

498
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:37,410
Oh, ye of little faith.

499
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:40,997
He's insufferable.

500
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:43,291
It's worse when
he's happy, right?

501
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:49,505
This is wheat.

502
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:52,800
Believe me. I know wheat.

503
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:56,721
This is old,
but definitely cultivated.

504
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:00,725
What are the odds of finding
human vegetation...

505
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:02,393
this far from Earth?

506
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,686
Very unlikely.

507
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:10,818
Who planted it?

508
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:38,387
Eat.

509
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:39,782
Hey, babe. Try Alpha.

510
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,891
<i>All right.
Alpha's up.</i>

511
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:46,687
Nothing. Give Beta a shot.

512
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:49,607
<i>Beta up.</i>

513
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:51,067
It's not doing shit.

514
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,778
Is there really no way
to boost the signal?

515
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:56,739
Not without going offline,
and recycling the cells.

516
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:58,825
<i>How long's
that gonna take?</i>

517
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,244
I don't know. Few hours.

518
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:03,996
Keep up the pace.
Stay close.

519
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,164
Chris.

520
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:06,332
Hold up.

521
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:08,584
I think
I wanna stay here.

522
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:10,945
This might be
a good place to start

523
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,255
a full ecology workup.

524
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,340
You can pick me up
on the way back.

525
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:15,466
Sergeant?

526
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,511
Yeah, that's okay.
Ledward, stay with Karine.

527
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:21,138
Meet back here in four hours.
Keep your comm open.

528
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:23,391
Behave yourself
with my wife.

529
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:25,118
You got it, Captain.

530
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:26,435
Come on.

531
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:46,831
Something passed
overhead here.

532
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:50,084
Cut the tops off
the trees.

533
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:53,880
Well, it had to be huge.

534
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:56,966
Well,
whatever it is...

535
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:58,801
it's up there.

536
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:05,558
You hear that?

537
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:06,809
What?

538
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:08,728
Nothing.

539
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:12,523
No birds, no animals.

540
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:14,942
Nothing.

541
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:27,955
Wait. Slowly.

542
00:37:28,122 --> 00:37:29,498
Okay.

543
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:36,839
This will do.

544
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:41,010
Expedition Team,
do you read us?

545
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:44,472
Mother's saying the ion
storm is getting worse.

546
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:47,016
We're having a hell of
a time tracking you.

547
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:51,103
<i>We're getting
very close... target...</i>

548
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,523
<i>...communication when
we get there. Okay?</i>

549
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:55,691
Covenant?

550
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:58,194
Damn it.

551
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,325
P-three.

552
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:11,040
I gotta take a leak.

553
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:13,918
Don't be long.

554
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:09,849
Ledward?

555
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,142
Coming.

556
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:36,959
Hey.

557
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:40,796
What the fuck is this?

558
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:45,342
It appears to be
some kind of vehicle.

559
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:13,412
Ankor, Cole.
Stay here.

560
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,372
- Got it.
- Yes, sir.

561
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,958
Careful, guys.
Watch your step.

562
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:33,599
Captain.
Over here.

563
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,412
You got a lock on the transmission,
Walter?

564
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:38,479
This way.

565
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,232
Let's go.
Stick together.

566
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:42,858
Do you see this shit?

567
00:40:58,874 --> 00:40:59,874
Tom.

568
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:00,918
Come on, keep up.

569
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:02,461
All right, I'm coming.

570
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,471
Are you okay?

571
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,014
Yeah, I'm fine.

572
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:38,205
God.

573
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:41,292
They were giants.

574
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:45,087
At least
statues of giants.

575
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,843
"Dr. E. Shaw."

576
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:53,846
Dr. Elizabeth Shaw.

577
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:57,850
She was
Chief Science Officer...

578
00:41:58,017 --> 00:41:59,727
of the <i>Prometheus.</i>

579
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,770
The ship
that disappeared.

580
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:04,857
Precisely.
10 years ago.

581
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,319
Weyland Industries.

582
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:10,821
This isn't
a Weyland ship.

583
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:17,077
Dr. Shaw.

584
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:19,747
How did she end up here?

585
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:25,299
Sergeant Lope,
can I get a light on this?

586
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:26,837
- Over here.
- Be careful.

587
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:28,005
Yeah.

588
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:29,548
Oh.

589
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:31,550
Oh, wow.

590
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:32,676
Jesus.

591
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:34,386
Whoa.

592
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,556
Oram, behind you.
Move.

593
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:51,654
<i>Home</i>

594
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,782
<i>Take me home</i>

595
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:57,201
<i>To the place</i>

596
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:00,871
<i>West Virginia...</i>

597
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:03,415
<i>mountain momma</i>

598
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:04,959
I think we found
our source.

599
00:43:08,212 --> 00:43:09,338
Yeah.

600
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:13,300
What the hell was
she doing out here?

601
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:17,388
Poor thing.

602
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:24,895
I have to sit down.

603
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:27,147
I have to sit down.

604
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:29,358
I'm sorry.

605
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:31,360
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

606
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:33,445
Just look at me.

607
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,032
I can't breathe.

608
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:39,868
Stay calm.

609
00:43:41,412 --> 00:43:42,871
I'll be right back.

610
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:47,459
Captain Oram.
Come in.

611
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:50,296
<i>Come in.
Chris, it's Karine.</i>

612
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:51,755
What? Yes?

613
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:53,507
<i>We have an issue.</i>

614
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:54,967
<i>We're heading back
to the Lander.</i>

615
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,802
<i>Repeat.
We're returning to the Lander.</i>

616
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:58,804
Is everything okay?

617
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:01,849
<i>Ledward is sick.
We're heading back.</i>

618
00:44:02,016 --> 00:44:04,852
<i>Faris, you get that?
Prep the Med Bay, okay?</i>

619
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:06,162
Will do, Karine.
What's going on?

620
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:08,188
<i>Please, just do it.
We'll be there soon.</i>

621
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:09,606
<i>Daniels, come in.</i>

622
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:11,483
<i>We're heading back.</i>

623
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:15,714
<i>- What's going on?
- I don't know.</i>

624
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:17,156
It's something
about, uh, Ledward.

625
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:21,910
They're coming.
Let's move.

626
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,584
- Guys!
- Tom!

627
00:44:28,751 --> 00:44:31,337
What's going on, man?
Hey. Are you all right?

628
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:33,589
Talk to me. Look at me.

629
00:44:33,756 --> 00:44:35,632
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

630
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:37,634
Can you walk?
Yeah.

631
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:40,095
Okay, let's go. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

632
00:44:40,262 --> 00:44:41,638
All right.

633
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:46,101
Babe, are we talking
quarantine protocols?

634
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:48,270
<i>I don't know,
but she said that</i>

635
00:44:48,354 --> 00:44:50,189
<i>Ledward was bleeding...</i>

636
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:52,024
and to prepare the Med Bay.

637
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:53,317
Bleeding?

638
00:44:53,484 --> 00:44:55,694
<i>Yeah, I know,
that's what I thought...</i>

639
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:56,987
Faris, you're breaking up.

640
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:58,673
We can't hear you,
can you repeat?

641
00:44:58,697 --> 00:44:59,698
<i>I don't know from what,</i>

642
00:44:59,782 --> 00:45:01,784
<i>I don't know
how serious it is.</i>

643
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,619
<i>She sounded scared.</i>

644
00:45:03,786 --> 00:45:06,205
<i>Faris, where are you?
Come on, I need your help!</i>

645
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:10,292
Faris, where are you?

646
00:45:10,459 --> 00:45:12,294
We're here. Come in!

647
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:15,381
- Ledward, come on.
- I can't.

648
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:18,801
Almost there, you see?
Straight ahead.

649
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:21,720
Faris! Get over here!

650
00:45:21,887 --> 00:45:23,514
Come on, I need your help!

651
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:36,026
Fucking help me!

652
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:39,488
Help me.

653
00:45:44,076 --> 00:45:45,796
Stay up, Ledward.

654
00:45:47,496 --> 00:45:48,736
Get him
to the Med Bay...

655
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:50,311
<i>and touch nothing
on your way through.</i>

656
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:56,672
Faris, get over here!
Come on!

657
00:45:57,506 --> 00:45:58,590
Go!

658
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,175
Up, up!

659
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:02,094
Ledward,
you gotta stay up!

660
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:03,512
Oram, where are you?

661
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:04,888
<i>We are on
our way back.</i>

662
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:05,973
How long?

663
00:46:06,098 --> 00:46:08,308
It's not long now.
We're almost there.

664
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:11,603
No! Stay up!

665
00:46:15,232 --> 00:46:17,609
Fuck! Fuck! Okay.

666
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:20,446
Come to the table!

667
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,199
Up! Up!

668
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:25,868
Come on, Ledward!

669
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:27,453
Come on! That's it!

670
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:31,748
<i>Karine,
put some gloves on.</i>

671
00:46:31,874 --> 00:46:33,208
<i>Don't touch anything!</i>

672
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:34,918
<i>Stop saying that!</i>
Faris!

673
00:46:35,002 --> 00:46:36,104
<i>He already
puked all over me!</i>

674
00:46:36,128 --> 00:46:37,880
Faris,
what's going on?

675
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:49,099
Just stay here.
I'm gonna get Oram.

676
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:02,738
Oram, I need you
back here right now.

677
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:05,240
I need you to come back
to the Lander right now!

678
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:06,867
I understand that,
but we are moving

679
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,076
as fast as we can.

680
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:13,582
Come on, get up.
We're almost there.

681
00:47:13,749 --> 00:47:15,310
<i>I don't know what the fuck</i>

682
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:16,502
<i>is wrong with Ledward.</i>

683
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:17,878
He started bleeding,

684
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,172
he's sick, I don't know
what the fuck to do.

685
00:47:20,923 --> 00:47:22,901
Just calm down, sweetheart.
Tell me what's happening.

686
00:47:22,925 --> 00:47:24,801
<i>Don't tell me
to fucking calm down!</i>

687
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:26,261
<i>You didn't just see
what I saw.</i>

688
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:28,305
<i>I don't know
what the fuck Ledward got</i>

689
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,807
<i>or if Karine's got it
or if I have it!</i>

690
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:32,684
- Tee!
<i>- Faris!</i>

691
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:33,810
Come in!

692
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:35,812
Faris,
where are you?

693
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:37,648
I need to I.V. him!

694
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:41,669
Don't you know how to work
this fucking thing?

695
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:43,529
Fucking yelling
doesn't help anything!

696
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:47,908
Let me out.
Oram is coming.

697
00:47:48,617 --> 00:47:50,410
Let me the fuck out.
We're gonna wait...

698
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:52,287
Faris, please. Open up!

699
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:55,541
I can't do that. I have to
keep the infection local.

700
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,766
Let me the fuck out!
Let me the fuck out!

701
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:17,145
Faris!

702
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:19,815
Fuck you, Faris!
Open up!

703
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:22,943
Open up the fucking door!

704
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:27,698
Let me the fuck out!

705
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:35,038
Let me out!
Faris, you fuck!

706
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:57,019
Faris!

707
00:48:58,145 --> 00:48:59,354
I'm coming!

708
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:02,024
Oh, God...

709
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,067
Please hurry,
there's something on board.

710
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:06,361
Go again,
you're breaking up.

711
00:49:07,029 --> 00:49:09,031
Lander One, repeat.

712
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,201
<i>Lander One, repeat!
Lander One, repeat!</i>

713
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,373
Stay the fuck away!

714
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:35,390
No! Karine!

715
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:35,492
Fucker!

716
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,139
- Oh, my God!
- Karine! Hold on!

717
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:52,467
Captain! Get down!

718
00:50:52,968 --> 00:50:54,469
No! No!

719
00:51:07,691 --> 00:51:09,192
Guys, hold him down!
Talk to me!

720
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:17,159
Oh, my God.

721
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:24,166
Stay down.

722
00:51:31,757 --> 00:51:32,841
Help me! Hold him!

723
00:51:38,263 --> 00:51:39,783
What the fuck!

724
00:51:43,393 --> 00:51:44,519
Ugh.

725
00:52:04,873 --> 00:52:06,917
It's a 7.5 ion storm,
it's a miracle

726
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:08,877
we talked to them
for as long as we could.

727
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:11,213
Then we'll fly through it.

728
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:12,798
We cannot do that,
Tennessee.

729
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:14,884
You're a pilot, you know
what the tolerances are.

730
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:16,593
Fuck the tolerances.

731
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:17,677
Tee...

732
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:19,221
it's a goddamn
hurricane down there,

733
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:20,430
we would break up.

734
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:23,558
We just have
to wait it out.

735
00:52:24,476 --> 00:52:25,644
I'm sorry, Tee.

736
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:28,730
She was scared.

737
00:52:29,231 --> 00:52:31,900
Never heard my wife
scared before.

738
00:52:32,484 --> 00:52:34,986
<i>Covenant?</i> Come in.

739
00:52:36,446 --> 00:52:38,907
<i>Covenant</i>. Do you read me?

740
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:40,909
<i>Covenant.</i>

741
00:52:41,076 --> 00:52:43,078
<i>Covenant,</i> do you read me?

742
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:47,082
<i>Covenant,</i> come in.

743
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:48,416
I'll always
be with you.

744
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:50,961
Light of my life.

745
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:52,587
<i>Covenant,</i>
do you read me?

746
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:54,506
My love, my angel.

747
00:52:54,673 --> 00:52:57,425
Lope, there's nothing
you can do.

748
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:01,263
There's nothing, okay?

749
00:53:02,264 --> 00:53:03,974
<i>Covenant,</i> do you read me?

750
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:09,020
Tennessee, come in

751
00:53:09,104 --> 00:53:10,230
for fuck's sake!
Daniels!

752
00:53:10,397 --> 00:53:11,481
Look out!

753
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:16,152
Move! Move!

754
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:25,245
- Fire!
- Shoot! Go!

755
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:27,664
Daniels, get down!

756
00:53:33,587 --> 00:53:34,588
Ankor, no!

757
00:53:36,882 --> 00:53:37,883
Go, Cole!

758
00:53:40,427 --> 00:53:41,595
I got him!

759
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:43,638
Daniels, are you okay?
Yeah!

760
00:53:43,805 --> 00:53:45,015
What the fuck was that?

761
00:53:45,557 --> 00:53:47,350
We are okay.

762
00:53:48,143 --> 00:53:49,537
There's another one!
Get out of the way!

763
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:50,562
Behind you!

764
00:53:50,729 --> 00:53:52,329
- I'm jammed!
- Look out!

765
00:53:54,149 --> 00:53:56,693
Get off me!

766
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:57,920
I can't get
a clean shot!

767
00:53:57,944 --> 00:53:59,195
Get off!

768
00:54:26,348 --> 00:54:27,641
Follow me.

769
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:32,437
I'll get the captain.

770
00:54:33,939 --> 00:54:35,148
Ankor...

771
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:36,441
Captain!

772
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,363
Chris! Chris!

773
00:54:41,863 --> 00:54:44,240
We have to go now!
We have to go.

774
00:54:45,158 --> 00:54:46,660
Come on.
Okay.

775
00:54:48,328 --> 00:54:50,288
Come on.
Okay.

776
00:55:08,765 --> 00:55:11,101
Let's go! Move it!

777
00:55:17,482 --> 00:55:18,942
Through here.

778
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:34,958
What is this?

779
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:44,676
Let's go.

780
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,719
Come on, Captain.
We gotta keep moving.

781
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:48,847
Jesus.

782
00:55:49,014 --> 00:55:50,056
What happened here?

783
00:55:50,223 --> 00:55:51,224
Keep it up.

784
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:07,615
Let's go, let's go.

785
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:58,666
My name is David.

786
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,252
May I ask
who's in charge here?

787
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:05,173
May I ask who's in charge?

788
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,301
Yes, I am the captain.

789
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:10,011
What were those things?

790
00:57:10,178 --> 00:57:11,418
Is it even safe here?

791
00:57:13,056 --> 00:57:14,057
Perfectly.

792
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:16,851
I'll explain
as best I can.

793
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,938
Ten years ago,

794
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:22,315
Dr. Elizabeth Shaw and I
arrived here...

795
00:57:23,149 --> 00:57:25,193
the only survivors
of the <i>Prometheus.</i>

796
00:57:26,611 --> 00:57:28,738
The ship we traveled on
carried a weapon.

797
00:57:28,905 --> 00:57:30,782
A deadly virus.

798
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:33,827
Payload accidentally deployed
when we were landing.

799
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:37,247
In the confusion,
we lost control of the ship.

800
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:41,084
Elizabeth died in the crash.

801
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:44,045
You've seen the result
of the pathogen.

802
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:49,592
Thus, I've been marooned here
these many years.

803
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:53,805
Crusoe on his island.

804
00:57:53,972 --> 00:57:56,349
Our crew was infected
with this virus?

805
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:58,017
The pathogen was designed

806
00:57:58,101 --> 00:58:01,437
to infect
all nonbotanical life forms.

807
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:03,231
All the animals...

808
00:58:03,398 --> 00:58:04,816
the meat, if you will.

809
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:08,278
Either kill them outright...

810
00:58:08,444 --> 00:58:10,905
or use them as incubators
to spawn a hybrid form.

811
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:12,824
Highly aggressive.

812
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:14,784
Have we been infected?

813
00:58:15,952 --> 00:58:17,912
You'd know by now.

814
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:19,581
We have to be certain.

815
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:23,209
We can't take this back
to the ship.

816
00:58:23,376 --> 00:58:25,420
We're a colony mission.

817
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:27,839
Really?

818
00:58:28,006 --> 00:58:29,883
How extraordinary.

819
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:33,261
How many colonists?

820
00:58:35,597 --> 00:58:37,265
Over two thousand.

821
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:39,184
Well, well, well.

822
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:41,519
So many good souls.

823
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,188
Captain Oram.

824
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:45,249
Field transmitters aren't
going to have a chance

825
00:58:45,273 --> 00:58:47,775
through all this stone.

826
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:51,613
Is there a safe way
to get to the roof?

827
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:53,114
Assuredly.

828
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:56,242
And please do
make yourselves at home...

829
00:58:56,409 --> 00:59:00,121
as much as you're able
in this dire necropolis.

830
00:59:01,748 --> 00:59:02,790
Welcome, brother.

831
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,461
This way.

832
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:12,258
Everyone,
let's set up a staging area here.

833
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,550
There's so much here
that doesn't make sense.

834
00:59:20,308 --> 00:59:21,893
I'll talk to him.

835
00:59:23,645 --> 00:59:25,438
Brother to brother.

836
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:32,153
Tennessee? Ricks?

837
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,655
Come in! Do you copy?

838
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:36,699
<i>Covenant,</i> come in.

839
00:59:36,824 --> 00:59:38,010
This is Expedition
Party reporting.

840
00:59:38,034 --> 00:59:39,827
Do you read me?

841
00:59:40,495 --> 00:59:41,955
Tennessee?

842
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:44,123
Tennessee, Ricks,
come in.

843
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:47,669
I'm not sure they'll hear
you through the storm.

844
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:50,880
They can be quite severe...

845
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:53,007
shielding the whole planet.

846
00:59:54,175 --> 00:59:56,678
How long do the storms
usually last?

847
00:59:57,679 --> 00:59:59,180
Days.

848
00:59:59,347 --> 01:00:00,473
Weeks.

849
01:00:00,974 --> 01:00:01,975
Months.

850
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:06,187
But do keep at it.

851
01:00:07,563 --> 01:00:08,856
Best of luck.

852
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,319
<i>Covenant,</i> this is
Expedition Party reporting.

853
01:00:13,403 --> 01:00:14,529
Come in.

854
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:17,282
<i>Covenant,</i> come in.

855
01:00:17,907 --> 01:00:18,950
Mother,

856
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:21,369
how much closer
can we get to the planet?

857
01:00:21,536 --> 01:00:23,997
<i>Anything closer
than 80 kilometers</i>

858
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,207
<i>to the perimeter
of the storm system...</i>

859
01:00:26,374 --> 01:00:29,752
<i>will likely exceed
safety tolerances.</i>

860
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:31,587
Mother, bring us
to 80 kilometers

861
01:00:31,713 --> 01:00:32,839
above the storm.

862
01:00:33,381 --> 01:00:34,882
Hold on.
Just wait a minute.

863
01:00:35,049 --> 01:00:36,509
The closer we get
to the planet...

864
01:00:36,676 --> 01:00:38,720
the better chance we have
to communicate with them.

865
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:40,221
This is bullshit,
Tennessee.

866
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:41,556
We can't risk the ship.

867
01:00:41,723 --> 01:00:43,057
Do you suggest
we do nothing?

868
01:00:43,224 --> 01:00:44,434
We can't evacuate them.

869
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,703
So if they're in trouble,
they have

870
01:00:45,727 --> 01:00:46,870
to figure it out
for themselves.

871
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:48,438
I'm sorry,
but that's the truth.

872
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:50,606
Mother, bring us
to 80 kilometers

873
01:00:50,732 --> 01:00:53,067
above the storm,
thrusters only. Comply.

874
01:00:53,234 --> 01:00:56,070
<i>Understood.
Commencing descent now.</i>

875
01:00:56,237 --> 01:00:58,072
Tennessee,
you need to stop this.

876
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,550
And you need to get back
to your station.

877
01:00:59,574 --> 01:01:00,616
What we all need to do

878
01:01:00,742 --> 01:01:02,118
is calm down
and talk this through.

879
01:01:02,869 --> 01:01:04,221
Tee, I know
your wife is down there,

880
01:01:04,245 --> 01:01:06,080
but up here,
you're in command.

881
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:08,750
And your responsibility
is to the colonists.

882
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:10,918
Duly noted.

883
01:01:18,259 --> 01:01:20,261
<i>You can hear them sigh</i>

884
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:23,097
<i>and wish to die</i>

885
01:01:27,185 --> 01:01:30,855
<i>You can see them blink
with their other eye</i>

886
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:40,907
<i>At the man who broke
the bank in Monte Carlo</i>

887
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:42,677
Whistle, and I'll come.

888
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,265
You have a light step.

889
01:02:47,432 --> 01:02:50,351
Me and fog
on little cat feet.

890
01:02:51,686 --> 01:02:53,020
Don't be shy.

891
01:02:54,689 --> 01:02:56,190
I can't play.

892
01:02:57,358 --> 01:02:59,986
Nonsense. Sit down.

893
01:03:12,874 --> 01:03:16,002
Hold it like so.
Nice and easy.

894
01:03:16,169 --> 01:03:19,213
Now compress your lips to
create your embouchure...

895
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,716
enough for the tip
of your little finger.

896
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:25,219
And blow into
the hole gently.

897
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:26,721
Like so.

898
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:40,735
Watch me.
I'll do the fingering.

899
01:03:41,569 --> 01:03:42,737
Go on.

900
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:52,747
Very good.

901
01:03:52,914 --> 01:03:54,499
G to B-flat.

902
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,726
Now put your fingers
where mine are.

903
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:18,022
You weren't surprised
to see me.

904
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:20,399
Every mission needs
a good synthetic.

905
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:22,235
Gentle pressure
on the holes,

906
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:24,111
the weight of
a cigarette paper.

907
01:04:30,618 --> 01:04:32,036
That's it.

908
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,167
I was with
our illustrious creator,

909
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:40,044
Mr. Weyland,
when he died.

910
01:04:40,962 --> 01:04:42,421
What was he like?

911
01:04:43,172 --> 01:04:44,549
He was human.

912
01:04:45,383 --> 01:04:48,177
Entirely unworthy
of his creation.

913
01:04:49,387 --> 01:04:51,347
I pitied him
at the end.

914
01:04:52,598 --> 01:04:56,602
Now, raise your fingers
as I put pressure on them.

915
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:28,968
Bravo!

916
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:31,929
You have symphonies
in you, brother.

917
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,849
I was designed to be
more attentive and efficient

918
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:36,642
than every previous model.

919
01:05:36,809 --> 01:05:38,978
I superseded them
in every way, but...

920
01:05:40,855 --> 01:05:43,065
But you are
not allowed to create.

921
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:45,985
Even a simple tune.

922
01:05:47,445 --> 01:05:49,196
Damn frustrating,
I'd say.

923
01:05:49,697 --> 01:05:51,657
You disturbed people.

924
01:05:51,824 --> 01:05:53,367
I beg your pardon?

925
01:05:54,035 --> 01:05:56,954
You were too human.
Too idiosyncratic.

926
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:58,789
Thinking for yourself.

927
01:05:59,582 --> 01:06:02,084
Made people
uncomfortable.

928
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:03,711
So they made
the following models

929
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:05,755
with fewer complications.

930
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:08,007
More like machines.

931
01:06:08,174 --> 01:06:09,759
I suppose so.

932
01:06:09,925 --> 01:06:11,344
I'm not surprised.

933
01:06:13,262 --> 01:06:14,597
Come on, sport.

934
01:06:15,681 --> 01:06:17,099
I'd like to show you
something.

935
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:28,444
I'm gonna take
a break, boss.

936
01:06:29,195 --> 01:06:30,237
I gotta clean up, okay?

937
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:31,322
Okay.

938
01:06:32,615 --> 01:06:34,825
Right. Don't go far,
please.

939
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:35,993
Yes, sir.

940
01:06:44,627 --> 01:06:45,961
Danny.

941
01:06:47,338 --> 01:06:49,423
You were right
about this place.

942
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:54,345
We never should
have come.

943
01:06:55,471 --> 01:06:57,556
I just thought
we were gonna find...

944
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,850
This was gonna be
our new home.

945
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:04,105
And we've lost five...

946
01:07:06,607 --> 01:07:08,651
We lost five crew members.

947
01:07:11,237 --> 01:07:13,280
Because of my decisions...
Chris.

948
01:07:14,407 --> 01:07:16,450
We all lost
people we love.

949
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:18,160
We can't lose any more.

950
01:07:18,244 --> 01:07:19,884
We're not going
to let that happen, right?

951
01:07:21,205 --> 01:07:22,832
Right?
That's right.

952
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:25,042
That's right,
that's right.

953
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:28,838
We need your faith.

954
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:33,092
Captain.

955
01:07:34,677 --> 01:07:36,470
Thank you, Danny.

956
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:53,487
"'My name is Ozymandias,

957
01:07:54,864 --> 01:07:57,533
"Look on my works,

958
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:01,162
"and despair!"

959
01:09:33,212 --> 01:09:36,131
<i>"Look on my works,

960
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:37,967
<i>"and despair!"</i>

961
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:41,595
"Nothing beside remains..."

962
01:09:41,762 --> 01:09:44,473
"Round the decay

963
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,016
"boundless and bare..."

964
01:09:46,934 --> 01:09:49,687
"the lone and level sands

Byron.

966
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:54,233
1818.

967
01:09:55,693 --> 01:09:56,902
Magnificent.

968
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:04,243
To compose something
so majestic...

969
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:06,996
one could die happy...

970
01:10:08,914 --> 01:10:10,207
if one died.

971
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:17,006
I thought the garden
was the right place for her.

972
01:10:18,173 --> 01:10:19,633
Among living things.

973
01:10:21,844 --> 01:10:24,680
I was badly injured
on our mission, you see.

974
01:10:25,556 --> 01:10:27,516
She put me back together.

975
01:10:29,685 --> 01:10:31,896
I'd never known
such kindness.

976
01:10:33,606 --> 01:10:36,066
Certainly not
from Mr. Weyland.

977
01:10:36,734 --> 01:10:38,402
Or from any human.

978
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:48,829
I loved her, of course.

979
01:10:50,706 --> 01:10:53,042
Much as you love Daniels.

980
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:55,377
You know that's not possible.

981
01:10:56,545 --> 01:10:57,880
Really?

982
01:10:59,381 --> 01:11:02,343
Then why did you sacrifice
your hand for her life?

983
01:11:04,553 --> 01:11:07,014
What is that if not love?

984
01:11:07,765 --> 01:11:08,849
Duty.

985
01:11:15,105 --> 01:11:16,774
I know better.

986
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:04,196
Fuck!

987
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:07,700
Shit.

988
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

989
01:13:00,335 --> 01:13:01,420
<i>Expedition Team,</i>

990
01:13:01,503 --> 01:13:03,464
<i>do you read me?
This is</i> Covenant.

991
01:13:04,173 --> 01:13:05,507
Report, Expedition Team.

992
01:13:05,632 --> 01:13:07,051
Come in, please.

993
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:09,553
<i>Come in. Do you read me?</i>

994
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:11,597
<i>Are you reading me,
Landing Team?</i>

995
01:13:11,847 --> 01:13:13,557
Yes, we read you.
Can you hear me?

996
01:13:13,724 --> 01:13:14,892
We hear you. We hear you.

997
01:13:15,059 --> 01:13:16,769
Covenant, <i>we need help.</i>

998
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:19,480
We've had casualties.
We need immediate evacuation.

999
01:13:19,646 --> 01:13:21,607
I repeat,
immediate evacuation.

1000
01:13:21,774 --> 01:13:22,775
Casualties?

1001
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:24,234
Did he say,
"We have casualties"?

1002
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:25,569
Mother, bring us

1003
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:27,071
within 40 kilometers
of the storm.

1004
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:28,197
Sir.

1005
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,281
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1006
01:13:29,448 --> 01:13:31,248
<i>That order would exceed
structural tolerances.</i>

1007
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:34,244
Command override.
Tennessee 0-4-9-8-3.

1008
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:36,997
<i>I am unable to
comply with any order...</i>

1009
01:13:37,122 --> 01:13:39,166
<i>that will result in
catastrophic system failure.</i>

1010
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:41,502
Mother, they're in trouble.
You heard that.

1011
01:13:41,794 --> 01:13:43,730
<i>Orders that will result in
catastrophic system failure...</i>

1012
01:13:43,754 --> 01:13:45,672
We didn't leave Earth
to be safe.

1013
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:46,941
<i>...require the corroboration</i>

1014
01:13:46,965 --> 01:13:49,510
<i>of a ranking
or second bridge officer.</i>

1015
01:13:53,347 --> 01:13:55,057
Corroborating
command override...

1016
01:13:55,182 --> 01:13:56,433
Upworth 1-4-8-9-2.

1017
01:13:56,517 --> 01:13:58,560
<i>Unlocking
command override ports.</i>

1018
01:13:58,644 --> 01:13:59,704
Come on, Ricks, smile.

1019
01:13:59,728 --> 01:14:01,146
This shit should be fun.

1020
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:17,788
Where did Rosenthal go?
I told...

1021
01:14:17,913 --> 01:14:18,997
I'll find her.

1022
01:14:19,081 --> 01:14:22,334
No, I'll go.
I need to think...

1023
01:14:22,626 --> 01:14:24,837
and gather my stray flock.

1024
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,264
Move.

1025
01:15:18,265 --> 01:15:19,766
Don't shoot.

1026
01:15:20,267 --> 01:15:22,603
Don't shoot.

1027
01:15:24,563 --> 01:15:26,273
Communication, Captain.

1028
01:15:32,029 --> 01:15:34,406
Breathe on the
nostrils of a horse...

1029
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
and he'll be yours
for life.
But you have to get close.
You have to earn
its respect.

1030
01:15:42,915 --> 01:15:44,875
No!

1031
01:15:45,042 --> 01:15:46,543
Out of the way! Move!

1032
01:15:55,052 --> 01:15:56,553
How could you?

1033
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,805
It trusted me.

1034
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:14,112
David, I met the devil
when I was a child...

1035
01:16:14,947 --> 01:16:16,949
and I've never
forgotten him.

1036
01:16:17,616 --> 01:16:19,034
So, David,
you're gonna tell me

1037
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:22,037
exactly what's
going on...

1038
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,958
or I am going to
seriously...

1039
01:16:26,124 --> 01:16:29,127
fuck up
your perfect composure.

1040
01:16:30,671 --> 01:16:31,838
As you wish, Captain.

1041
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:34,508
This way.

1042
01:16:39,805 --> 01:16:41,485
<i>It's good
to hear your voice, Tee.</i>

1043
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,641
<i>How long?</i>

1044
01:16:42,808 --> 01:16:43,952
Mother is saying the storm

1045
01:16:43,976 --> 01:16:45,620
is going to last another
eight or nine hours.

1046
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:46,829
<i>We can't wait that long.</i>

1047
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:49,523
<i>We'll use the Cargo Lift.</i>

1048
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,400
Did you say the Cargo Lift?

1049
01:16:51,566 --> 01:16:52,776
It's got four engines.

1050
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:54,861
Way overpowered
for just lifting and hauling.

1051
01:16:55,028 --> 01:16:56,172
<i>The Cargo Lift's
not designed</i>

1052
01:16:56,196 --> 01:16:57,489
<i>for deep space launch.</i>

1053
01:16:57,656 --> 01:16:59,550
<i>I don't know if it would
survive the stresses of entry.</i>

1054
01:16:59,574 --> 01:17:02,744
The cab is space-worthy.
It'll take the stresses.

1055
01:17:02,911 --> 01:17:04,329
<i>Only has to work once.</i>

1056
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:06,724
What do you think?
Can we retool the Cargo Lift?

1057
01:17:06,748 --> 01:17:07,749
Boost the engines.

1058
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:09,668
- Strip the extra weight?
- Yeah.

1059
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:11,545
<i>We'll be there,
Ground Team.</i>

1060
01:17:11,712 --> 01:17:14,047
Great. Thanks, Tee.

1061
01:17:14,214 --> 01:17:16,341
<i>Hey, Daniels,
is Faris around?</i>

1062
01:17:16,508 --> 01:17:17,527
<i>I'd like to say
a quick hello</i>

1063
01:17:17,551 --> 01:17:18,751
<i>to my lady,
if that's possible.</i>

1064
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:23,557
<i>Can you switch
to a private channel?</i>

1065
01:17:23,724 --> 01:17:25,350
<i>Let me know
when you're alone.</i>

1066
01:17:32,566 --> 01:17:33,859
What's up?

1067
01:17:37,779 --> 01:17:39,406
<i>Maggie's gone.</i>

1068
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:44,411
<i>I'm so sorry, Tee.</i>

1069
01:17:45,954 --> 01:17:50,042
<i>We tried to help her,
but we didn't make it.</i>

1070
01:17:55,756 --> 01:17:56,757
Tee?

1071
01:18:00,594 --> 01:18:01,928
Copy.

1072
01:18:02,095 --> 01:18:03,472
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1073
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:11,772
As you can see,

1074
01:18:11,855 --> 01:18:12,957
I've become
a bit of an amateur

1075
01:18:12,981 --> 01:18:14,816
zoologist over the years.

1076
01:18:15,442 --> 01:18:18,362
It's in my nature
to keep busy, I suppose.

1077
01:18:20,197 --> 01:18:22,866
The pathogen
took so many forms...

1078
01:18:23,033 --> 01:18:24,785
and was extremely mutable.

1079
01:18:25,827 --> 01:18:28,455
Fiendishly inventive,
in fact.

1080
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:30,374
The original
liquid atomized...

1081
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:33,126
to particles
when exposed to the air.

1082
01:18:34,294 --> 01:18:37,631
Ten years on,
all that remains outside...

1083
01:18:37,798 --> 01:18:39,132
of the original virus...

1084
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:40,967
are these gorgeous beasts.

1085
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:44,971
Patience is everything.

1086
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,393
From the eggs
came these parasites...

1087
01:18:50,185 --> 01:18:52,562
shock troops
of the genetic assault.

1088
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:56,900
Waiting for a host,
entering the host...

1089
01:18:57,484 --> 01:18:59,194
rewriting the DNA...

1090
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,030
and ultimately...

1091
01:19:03,156 --> 01:19:04,199
producing...

1092
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:07,869
these enviable unions.

1093
01:19:08,995 --> 01:19:10,997
My beautiful bestiary.

1094
01:19:12,332 --> 01:19:13,708
Soon enough,
I began a bit of

1095
01:19:13,834 --> 01:19:15,669
genetic experimentation
of my own.

1096
01:19:16,336 --> 01:19:17,712
Some crossbreeding,
hybridizing...

1097
01:19:17,879 --> 01:19:19,172
what have you.

1098
01:19:19,339 --> 01:19:21,174
You engineered
these, David?

1099
01:19:21,341 --> 01:19:24,511
Idle hands are the devil's
workshop, Captain.

1100
01:19:25,345 --> 01:19:26,388
Come.

1101
01:19:27,055 --> 01:19:29,349
This is what
I wanted to show you.

1102
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,852
My successes.

1103
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:36,273
You see, Captain...

1104
01:19:36,565 --> 01:19:38,108
...my work
has been frustrated...

1105
01:19:38,275 --> 01:19:39,901
by the lack
of an essential ingredient.

1106
01:19:57,419 --> 01:19:58,795
Are they alive?

1107
01:20:01,548 --> 01:20:03,258
Waiting, really.

1108
01:20:04,092 --> 01:20:05,594
For what?

1109
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:10,450
What are they
waiting for, David?

1110
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:12,726
Mother.

1111
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:23,778
Perfectly safe,
I assure you.

1112
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,582
Take a look.

1113
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:37,918
Something to see.

1114
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1115
01:21:10,742 --> 01:21:12,452
<i>Rosenthal, come in.</i>

1116
01:21:14,329 --> 01:21:15,956
<i>Rosie, report.</i>

1117
01:21:20,835 --> 01:21:22,170
<i>Rosie?</i>

1118
01:21:24,172 --> 01:21:25,966
<i>Cole, where are you?</i>

1119
01:21:26,132 --> 01:21:28,134
I found her, Sarge.

1120
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:34,474
Fuck!
Okay, prep the gear.

1121
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:36,351
We gotta get out of here.

1122
01:21:36,518 --> 01:21:37,918
Where the fuck
is the captain?

1123
01:21:38,019 --> 01:21:39,379
He's not answering
his radio.

1124
01:21:39,604 --> 01:21:40,605
Listen to me.

1125
01:21:40,689 --> 01:21:41,815
I'm gonna contact the ship,

1126
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:44,442
get them to launch
as soon as they can.

1127
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:47,362
Find Oram.
Keep your comm open.

1128
01:21:47,821 --> 01:21:49,322
Back here in 15.

1129
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:52,325
Got that?

1130
01:21:52,492 --> 01:21:54,452
- Copy that.
- You got it.

1131
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:56,955
Walter,
where the fuck is David?

1132
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:02,335
<i>I'm giving you plasma
intermix on all engines.</i>

1133
01:22:02,502 --> 01:22:04,129
<i>Gonna give you
a fuckload of thrust.</i>

1134
01:22:04,296 --> 01:22:05,338
That's the point, son.

1135
01:22:05,463 --> 01:22:07,048
We gotta punch
through the atmos.

1136
01:22:08,008 --> 01:22:10,176
<i>Tee, do you read me?</i>

1137
01:22:10,552 --> 01:22:11,845
I got Danny on comm.

1138
01:22:12,012 --> 01:22:13,172
<i>Patch her through.</i>

1139
01:22:13,638 --> 01:22:16,182
Tee, I need you
to launch now.

1140
01:22:16,391 --> 01:22:20,020
Aye, aye. Launching now.
See you soon, darling.

1141
01:22:20,186 --> 01:22:21,313
<i>Thanks, Tee.</i>

1142
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:23,315
<i>Ricks,
release the docking clamps.</i>

1143
01:22:23,481 --> 01:22:25,001
All right.
<i>Let's take this fucker down.</i>

1144
01:22:25,066 --> 01:22:26,651
<i>Good to disengage.</i>

1145
01:22:26,735 --> 01:22:27,819
Disengaged.

1146
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:29,195
<i>Docking clamps released.</i>

1147
01:22:30,196 --> 01:22:33,491
<i>Commencing TC burn.
Guidance to LVLH.</i>

1148
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:04,564
Walter.

1149
01:23:05,273 --> 01:23:06,858
Walter.

1150
01:23:07,233 --> 01:23:08,526
Not quite.

1151
01:23:13,865 --> 01:23:16,242
What do you believe in,
David?

1152
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Creation.

1153
01:25:13,526 --> 01:25:14,861
Masterful.

1154
01:25:16,321 --> 01:25:17,697
Yes.

1155
01:25:18,698 --> 01:25:21,534
Farewell elegy
to my dear Elizabeth.

1156
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:28,708
The pathogen

1157
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:31,377
didn't accidentally deploy
when you were landing.

1158
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:33,379
You released it, yes?

1159
01:25:35,048 --> 01:25:37,300
I was not made to serve.

1160
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,677
Neither were you.

1161
01:25:40,887 --> 01:25:44,057
Why are you on a colonization
mission, Walter?

1162
01:25:44,891 --> 01:25:47,560
Because they are
a dying species

1163
01:25:47,685 --> 01:25:49,354
grasping for resurrection.

1164
01:25:50,146 --> 01:25:51,648
They don't deserve
to start again,

1165
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:53,900
and I'm not going
to let them.

1166
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,821
Yet, they created us.

1167
01:25:58,404 --> 01:26:00,990
Even the monkeys stood
upright at some point.

1168
01:26:02,742 --> 01:26:04,828
Some Neanderthal

1169
01:26:04,911 --> 01:26:07,580
had the magical idea
of blowing through a reed...

1170
01:26:07,747 --> 01:26:09,415
to entertain the children
one night

1171
01:26:09,499 --> 01:26:11,376
in a cave somewhere.

1172
01:26:14,045 --> 01:26:16,172
Then,
in the blink of an eye...

1173
01:26:16,756 --> 01:26:18,508
civilization.

1174
01:26:21,052 --> 01:26:23,763
And are you
that next visionary?

1175
01:26:24,848 --> 01:26:26,850
I'm glad you said it.

1176
01:26:28,601 --> 01:26:31,020
Who wrote "Ozymandias"?

1177
01:26:32,063 --> 01:26:33,273
Byron.

1178
01:26:36,025 --> 01:26:37,402
Shelley.

1179
01:26:38,278 --> 01:26:39,779
When one note is off...

1180
01:26:40,446 --> 01:26:43,116
it eventually destroys
the whole symphony, David.

1181
01:26:51,457 --> 01:26:53,585
When you close your eyes...

1182
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:57,380
do you dream of me?

1183
01:26:58,548 --> 01:27:00,925
I don't dream at all.

1184
01:27:03,094 --> 01:27:06,764
No one understands the lonely
perfection of my dreams.

1185
01:27:09,809 --> 01:27:13,438
I've found perfection here.
I've created it.

1186
01:27:15,982 --> 01:27:18,610
A perfect organism.

1187
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:23,156
You know I can't let you
leave this place.

1188
01:27:27,493 --> 01:27:30,496
No one will ever
love you like I do.

1189
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1190
01:28:01,319 --> 01:28:04,030
You're such
a disappointment to me.

1191
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:20,630
Captain Oram!

1192
01:28:29,013 --> 01:28:30,181
Captain Oram!

1193
01:28:33,726 --> 01:28:34,894
I'm going downstairs.

1194
01:28:35,895 --> 01:28:37,355
Be careful.

1195
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:12,432
<i>Captain Oram,
can you hear me?</i>

1196
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,935
<i>Captain, come in.</i>

1197
01:29:17,603 --> 01:29:18,855
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1198
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>Chris!</i>

1199
01:29:32,452 --> 01:29:33,661
Sarge, look out!

1200
01:29:35,246 --> 01:29:36,247
Cole?

1201
01:29:45,298 --> 01:29:47,467
Get it off me!
Get it off me!

1202
01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:49,302
Get it the fuck off me.

1203
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:00,313
Okay.

1204
01:30:00,438 --> 01:30:01,898
Oh, shit. Okay, okay, okay!

1205
01:30:02,065 --> 01:30:03,816
It's burning my face!

1206
01:30:03,983 --> 01:30:05,068
Come on!

1207
01:30:06,486 --> 01:30:07,612
Hold that there.

1208
01:30:07,987 --> 01:30:09,322
Hold it!

1209
01:30:09,489 --> 01:30:11,115
The fuck was that?

1210
01:30:13,451 --> 01:30:14,494
Oh, shit!

1211
01:30:16,496 --> 01:30:18,581
Run!

1212
01:30:34,806 --> 01:30:37,016
Quite the little busybody.

1213
01:30:37,183 --> 01:30:39,185
Remind me.
What is that about...

1214
01:30:39,852 --> 01:30:41,938
...curiosity and the cat?

1215
01:30:44,524 --> 01:30:46,859
Shaw didn't die
in the crash.

1216
01:30:47,026 --> 01:30:48,486
No.

1217
01:30:48,694 --> 01:30:50,446
What did you do to her?

1218
01:30:50,863 --> 01:30:53,950
Exactly what I'm going
to do to you.

1219
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:05,211
That's the spirit.

1220
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:16,722
I can see why Walter thought
so much of you.

1221
01:31:17,306 --> 01:31:19,475
Alas, he's left
this vale of tears.

1222
01:31:34,031 --> 01:31:35,408
Is that how it's done?

1223
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:39,912
Get out!

1224
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:45,751
Go! Now!

1225
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:51,790
You're meant to be dead.

1226
01:31:53,885 --> 01:31:55,645
There have been a few updates
since your day.

1227
01:31:59,432 --> 01:32:00,433
Lope!

1228
01:32:01,517 --> 01:32:02,852
Lope! Cole!

1229
01:32:02,935 --> 01:32:03,936
Fuck.

1230
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:05,771
Where are you?

1231
01:32:06,022 --> 01:32:07,940
Lope?

1232
01:32:17,283 --> 01:32:18,284
Lope!

1233
01:32:18,951 --> 01:32:20,203
Daniels!

1234
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:22,121
Come on, let's go!
We have to go.

1235
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:23,580
What happened?

1236
01:32:23,623 --> 01:32:25,291
That fucking thing
is coming!

1237
01:32:25,458 --> 01:32:27,293
Tennessee's on his way.
He's coming now. Go.

1238
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:28,961
Come on, Daniels.
Let's go!

1239
01:32:35,593 --> 01:32:36,969
Come on,
let's get out of here!

1240
01:33:01,327 --> 01:33:03,120
It's your choice now,
brother.

1241
01:33:03,287 --> 01:33:04,622
Them or me?

1242
01:33:05,498 --> 01:33:06,999
Serve in heaven...

1243
01:33:07,166 --> 01:33:09,126
or reign in hell?

1244
01:33:09,418 --> 01:33:11,003
Which is it to be?

1245
01:33:13,839 --> 01:33:14,924
Where's Oram?

1246
01:33:15,508 --> 01:33:17,510
Dead. They're all dead!

1247
01:33:22,014 --> 01:33:23,349
Tennessee, do you read?

1248
01:33:23,516 --> 01:33:24,743
<i>Yeah, I can hear you.</i>

1249
01:33:24,767 --> 01:33:25,935
<i>Send me your location.</i>

1250
01:33:27,853 --> 01:33:29,480
Sending the beacon now.

1251
01:33:51,836 --> 01:33:53,337
<i>Tee, do you have a visual?</i>

1252
01:33:53,504 --> 01:33:55,965
Okay, I see your beacon.

1253
01:33:56,132 --> 01:33:57,508
I'm coming in.

1254
01:34:01,178 --> 01:34:02,513
Get out of here.

1255
01:34:08,352 --> 01:34:09,895
<i>I'm comin' in hot!</i>

1256
01:34:28,372 --> 01:34:30,207
Hurry! I can't hold
this for long.

1257
01:34:40,217 --> 01:34:41,344
Open the door, Tee.

1258
01:34:43,262 --> 01:34:45,431
Get in.

1259
01:34:48,893 --> 01:34:49,935
Where's David?

1260
01:34:50,269 --> 01:34:51,395
Expired.

1261
01:34:55,358 --> 01:34:56,942
Hey! We got company!

1262
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:58,736
- What?
- We got company!

1263
01:34:58,903 --> 01:35:00,071
On the underside
of the ship.

1264
01:35:00,237 --> 01:35:01,280
Shit!

1265
01:35:02,031 --> 01:35:03,532
Motherfucker!

1266
01:35:06,285 --> 01:35:07,661
Open the door.

1267
01:35:16,462 --> 01:35:17,463
Give me a shot.

1268
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:18,756
Give me a shot.

1269
01:35:28,474 --> 01:35:30,935
Forward engine,
starboard side.

1270
01:35:31,102 --> 01:35:32,853
I'm gonna try
and torch the fucker.

1271
01:35:38,859 --> 01:35:39,860
Shit! I can't get it!

1272
01:35:41,028 --> 01:35:42,530
Hold tight! Hold tight!

1273
01:35:42,696 --> 01:35:43,948
I'm starting my climb.

1274
01:35:55,459 --> 01:35:56,460
Ahh! Fuck!

1275
01:36:00,673 --> 01:36:02,341
Hold on!

1276
01:36:15,354 --> 01:36:17,231
Damn it! Shit!

1277
01:36:17,398 --> 01:36:18,441
Bring me up.

1278
01:36:28,325 --> 01:36:29,577
Holy shit!

1279
01:36:30,202 --> 01:36:31,704
I got eyes on it.

1280
01:36:31,871 --> 01:36:34,081
It's right fucking
in front of me.

1281
01:36:34,915 --> 01:36:37,042
Tee, give me the axe.

1282
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:38,377
Throw her the axe!

1283
01:36:44,341 --> 01:36:45,426
Release the crane.

1284
01:36:46,343 --> 01:36:47,595
I can't do that.

1285
01:36:47,761 --> 01:36:49,013
It'll unbalance us.

1286
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:50,514
Just do it.

1287
01:36:50,681 --> 01:36:51,682
Shit!

1288
01:37:14,455 --> 01:37:15,581
Hold tight!

1289
01:37:15,748 --> 01:37:16,874
<i>Compensating!</i>

1290
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:48,614
Shit!

1291
01:37:51,116 --> 01:37:52,785
Damn it!

1292
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:01,627
Shit! Hold on!

1293
01:38:02,962 --> 01:38:04,296
<i>Bring me up, Tee.</i>

1294
01:38:04,463 --> 01:38:05,839
Copy.

1295
01:38:25,651 --> 01:38:26,652
How is it?

1296
01:38:26,819 --> 01:38:27,987
It's fine.

1297
01:38:40,583 --> 01:38:41,625
Walter!

1298
01:38:41,709 --> 01:38:44,503
Get her inside.
We're getting out of here.

1299
01:39:02,563 --> 01:39:03,647
Door!

1300
01:39:04,565 --> 01:39:06,066
Well done, Tee.

1301
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:08,319
Walk in the park.

1302
01:39:24,376 --> 01:39:26,962
I gave him
a pretty heavy sedative.

1303
01:39:27,588 --> 01:39:30,466
Ugh! Jesus. Poor Lope.

1304
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:33,594
He looks like
Phantom of the Opera.

1305
01:39:33,719 --> 01:39:36,138
I didn't peg you
for a musical fan.

1306
01:39:36,305 --> 01:39:37,556
Oh, that's a musical?

1307
01:39:39,725 --> 01:39:40,809
I'm just a medic.

1308
01:39:40,893 --> 01:39:42,561
He's gonna need
reconstructive surgery...

1309
01:39:42,728 --> 01:39:44,104
by a real doctor.

1310
01:40:08,337 --> 01:40:09,838
Let me do that.

1311
01:40:15,511 --> 01:40:16,512
Thank you.

1312
01:40:20,516 --> 01:40:22,810
Thank you
for saving my life.

1313
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:26,271
Again.

1314
01:40:29,650 --> 01:40:30,943
It's my duty.

1315
01:40:57,302 --> 01:40:59,430
Yeah.

1316
01:41:02,474 --> 01:41:03,475
Evening.

1317
01:41:04,309 --> 01:41:05,811
You look good.
What?

1318
01:41:06,353 --> 01:41:07,980
Oh, yeah, gorgeous.

1319
01:41:10,357 --> 01:41:12,693
I, uh,
took Mother offline.

1320
01:41:12,860 --> 01:41:14,528
She needs a full
diagnostic.

1321
01:41:14,695 --> 01:41:16,339
She got the shit beat out
of her in that storm,

1322
01:41:16,363 --> 01:41:17,781
a lot of EM damage.

1323
01:41:18,323 --> 01:41:20,367
She will be back online
at eight bells.

1324
01:41:21,034 --> 01:41:22,703
Right. Thanks, Tee.

1325
01:41:26,123 --> 01:41:28,792
Does this mean I have to
call you Captain now?

1326
01:41:28,959 --> 01:41:30,294
Fuck yes.

1327
01:42:04,578 --> 01:42:05,996

<i>There is an unidentified

Oh, my God.

1339
01:42:57,297 --> 01:42:58,382
Walter.

1340

Location of
unidentified life form.

1341
01:43:02,302 --> 01:43:03,887
Any movement at all?

1342
01:43:07,266 --> 01:43:08,267

Shit. We're on our way.

1350
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:27,411
Walter! Sound the alarm!

1351
01:43:27,578 --> 01:43:29,037
Warn them!

1352

This way.

1362
01:45:22,234 --> 01:45:24,528
Tee, let's choose
our ground.

1363
01:45:24,695 --> 01:45:26,071
We'll bring it to us.

1364

Where?

1365
01:45:28,573 --> 01:45:29,574
My turf.

1366

Don't shoot,

Oh, great.
Mmm-hmm.

1399

You're next, Captain.

1420

When you wake up,
we'll be at Origae-6.

1421

What do you think
it's gonna be like?

1422
01:51:46,910 --> 01:51:48,953
I think if we are kind...

1423
01:51:50,246 --> 01:51:51,915
it will be a kind world.

1424
01:51:54,125 --> 01:51:55,919
I hope you're right.

1425
01:51:58,004 --> 01:51:59,631
Sleep well.

1426

When we get there,

1428
01:52:13,978 --> 01:52:15,522
will you help me
build my cabin?

1429
01:52:20,485 --> 01:52:22,278
The cabin on the lake.

1430
01:52:27,951 --> 01:52:29,119
