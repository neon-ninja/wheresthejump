1
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,685
It's 1:00 p.m.
across all of Argentina.

2
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:39,387
This is a direct transmission from our
country's Armed Forces Naval Observatory.

3
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,477
4:00 p.m. GMT.

4
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:48,004
According
to the most recent information,

5
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,528
the number of people evacuated is approaching 700.

6
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:54,054
264 homes have been abandoned.

7
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:56,491
Unfortunately, projections suggest that lake water levels

8
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:59,189
are expected to rise
a further 12 to 15 inches

9
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:02,627
and if so, the number of
evacuees may reach a thousand.

10
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:04,325
It was a flood in 1985,

11
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:07,676
saw the result of Epecuen
disappear under water.

12
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:14,291
Known for the curing
powers of its salty lagoon.

13
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:19,905
But in the 1980s, the water that kept
that town alive, swallowed it whole.

14
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:21,646
As the flood receded,

15
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,129
it left behind
a lunar landscape...

16
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:29,132
They get here
by hitchhiking or by foot.

17
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:32,570
It's attracted
a lot of people to the area.

18
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:35,704
This has been
the worst flood disaster to strike

19
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:38,315
in the history of the
Argentine Republic.

20
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:42,928
Who remembers Epecuen? A huge event forgotten by most.

21
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:47,759
They do. They remember. It used to be
their home. Today there are only ruins.

22
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:52,503
Epecuen looks like the scene from a movie.
A horror movie...

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

24
00:04:57,906 --> 00:05:01,083
Ah, but that's nothing. You
should hear what happened to me.

25
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:05,261
I was cruising down Route 25 as I had
to cross into Venezuela from Colombia.

26
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,089
It was hot as hell.

27
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:11,789
Suddenly, I spot two babes hitchhiking
at the side of the highway.

28
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,705
I slam on the brakes. Two babes,
just your type Vasco...

29
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:18,100
Two back packers. One blonde, the
other brunette. Unbelievable...

30
00:05:18,143 --> 00:05:19,449
It was crazy.

31
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:23,235
"Where you headed?" I asked
them. "Venezuela."

32
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,064
I told them to get in, so they both
climbed in the back with their backpacks.

33
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:28,371
I saw the blonde was carrying
a rather strange package.

34
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:31,722
Weird, but what the heck,
in for a dime, in for a dollar.

35
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:34,246
We got moving and after
about a couple of miles

36
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,813
I look in the rearview mirror...

37
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:40,644
And I see them
all over each other kissing.

38
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:41,906
I thought, "Well,
if that's the way we're starting

39
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,473
"I can't wait to see where this
is going."

40
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,388
When we got to the border
control...

41
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,434
The girls say, "We're going to the
restroom and will be right back."

42
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:49,653
They left with the two
backpacks.

43
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:54,615
I stayed where I was. There was a
line of cars about two blocks long.

44
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:58,619
The tailback starts to move and
the chicks are still not back.

45
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,882
When I reach the border check I
look in the rearview mirror

46
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:02,753
and right there, right where
you are sitting Vasco...

47
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,146
I see the package.

48
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:06,844
Up to my armpits.

49
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:09,412
A cop with a dog approached me and
asked for the vehicle documents.

50
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:11,414
I hand him the papers...

51
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,678
And immediately he asks
"What's that you've got there?"

52
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:17,246
"Don't know, it's not mine,
I've no idea."

53
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:20,902
He asked me
to get out of the van.

54
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:24,427
As I'm getting out I see that
the dog is going crazy...

55
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:29,563
It goes running and attacks an old
lady in a skirt. He rips it off her.

56
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,478
She had forty bags of cocaine!

57
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,263
Amazing, right?

58
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:37,266
Another cop up ahead signaled
for me to move forward.

59
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:41,139
I crossed the border and
was already in Venezuela.

60
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:45,405
My ass was saved.
No clue about the girls...

61
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:46,536
And the package?

62
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,233
I've got it here!

63
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:50,888
Oh... you are so out of line...

64
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:55,850
I honestly have no idea who
I'm working with.

65
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:57,373
Hilarious...

66
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,898
Nice one.

67
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:23,007
Hey dude, could you turn down
the music a bit?

68
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:25,880
We're trying to make a documentary here.
Don't know if you had noticed...

69
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:27,621
No shit...

70
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:32,190
Okay, Carla...

71
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,108
What are your memories from
before the flood?

72
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:44,551
Not a lot really. I was only little at
the time, I just have some vague images.

73
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:46,204
Like what?

74
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:53,429
I remember the lakeside resort.
I always went there with my mom.

75
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:58,216
I didn't like the idea of the
lake because I couldn't swim...

76
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:04,745
But one day I decided to jump
in. I was just floating.

77
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:08,836
What happened was that the water was so
salty that it was impossible to sink.

78
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,578
A salty lake?

79
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:15,190
Yes, Epecuen was unique
that way.

80
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:19,629
Are you filming me, Erica?

81
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:24,112
Yes, take it easy... You look
gorgeous on camera.

82
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:26,680
I'm impressed...

83
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:30,031
Oh, wow, wow, wow!

84
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,951
Sorry, what can you remember
from the night of the flood?

85
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:43,566
I was in my room, sleeping.

86
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,352
I remember being wakened
by the sound of a siren...

87
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:53,271
And I heard a lot of screaming.

88
00:08:53,315 --> 00:09:00,278
When I got out of bed the water
was up to my knees.

89
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:05,457
My mom came into the room in a total
panic and lifted me up in her arms...

90
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:08,460
I remember she kept saying,

91
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:11,246
"We have to leave, we have to
leave." Over and over again.

92
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:17,948
And when we left, she locked the door
so that nobody would rob the place.

93
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:24,302
Poor her... she thought we would
come back...

94
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:28,045
Sorry for the interruption... Do we have
long to go? I need to go to the restroom.

95
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,004
Could you please stop
asking crappy questions?

96
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:31,527
Can't you see
we're recording here?

97
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,834
Why don't you pay attention
to what's going on?

98
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:36,488
We're recording! What's
wrong with you people...

99
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:20,881
Thanks, darling.

100
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:26,495
What a place, eh...

101
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,192
Girls, will you come
with me to the restroom?

102
00:10:28,236 --> 00:10:29,977
Okay, sure. Darling, I'm
going to the restroom.

103
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,765
Look...

104
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:39,508
I take one shot here, another there, and
here you have her butt in close-up.

105
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:42,903
What an ass she has!
Pity she prefers scissoring...

106
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:44,556
Scissoring?

107
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,299
Yeah, scissoring... You know,
girls on girls. Scissoring...

108
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:50,040
Why don't you go shooting the
environment?

109
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:52,477
Birds, crickets. We need
that stuff, come on...

110
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,705
Hello.

111
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,228
There seems to be nobody here.

112
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,886
Hello.

113
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,548
I'm coming...

114
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:26,163
How are you?

115
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:30,820
Hi there. How are you?

116
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,478
What would you like?

117
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:37,827
Could I use the restroom,
please?

118
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:44,225
Yes... Over there, through that door.
Right at the back.

119
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:46,444
Thanks.

120
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,449
You're not from around here,
are you?

121
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:52,712
No, no.
We're from the capital.

122
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:56,280
Ah, from the capital...

123
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:59,588
I thought so... Do you know
what capital means? Head.

124
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:05,246
So, what can I get you?

125
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,901
What's going on? Is there
nobody serving around here?

126
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:10,294
What is that, Vasco?

127
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:14,211
Ahh... that's a nice little gadget
you've got here! Does it have a GPS?

128
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:16,474
Yes, it comes with
a jerk detector.

129
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:20,087
Look! It tells me there's a real
big jerk close by right now.

130
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,743
That was a good one...

131
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:16,333
I can offer you
a few meat pies.

132
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:19,423
No, no, it's okay ma'am.
Thanks...

133
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,904
What? Are you not
going to have anything?

134
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:24,689
No sweetie... You must
have something to eat.

135
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:30,521
I'm not just here to clean up
the shit after the tourists.

136
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:36,571
So have a think about
how many you'd like, okay?

137
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:50,106
So you come from the city...

138
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,937
I had a cousin who lived in the
capital. Her name was Olga.

139
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:57,331
She used to come every summer.

140
00:14:57,374 --> 00:15:00,638
One time she slept with
Juancito...

141
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:04,468
Another time she went
to bed with Pedrito...

142
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:07,819
Until one summer she
bedded a married man.

143
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:10,300
And do you know what
happened to the poor thing?

144
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,871
They found her
floating in the lake.

145
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:18,569
Poor little Olga...

146
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:20,615
Poor little Olga...

147
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,835
Even though she was Miss
Know-It-All.

148
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:25,837
Hey girl!

149
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,840
You look just like Olga!

150
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:31,626
That's incredible!

151
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,237
It is true...

152
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:36,196
She really looks like
little Olga.

153
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,371
Well...

154
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:39,503
How many are you going to eat,
damn it?

155
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:47,903
What are you doing?

156
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,948
What have you lost?

157
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,254
What are you looking for?

158
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:54,475
We're looking for the boss...

159
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:56,651
In the grease pit?

160
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,307
Let's take a look...

161
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,570
Boss!

162
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:04,659
Boss!

163
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:07,967
You know there's nobody
down there...

164
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,186
Do I look like a jerk?
I'm the boss!

165
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,406
No sir... So what have you taken?

166
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,886
Tell me what you stole! Nothing sir,
nothing at all...

167
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,801
I was just kidding...

168
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:17,933
What are you looking for?

169
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,282
Gas.

170
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:21,937
Gas? Gas. We need to fill up

171
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,721
Okay, just let me finish something
and I'll be right there.

172
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:25,071
Great, thanks.

173
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,403
What are you doing here?

174
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:39,145
Let's go.
They're waiting for us.

175
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,845
Girls, you have no idea about
the state of that restroom...

176
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:48,154
No. And you have no idea about those meat
pies I bought for your lunch, my darling.

177
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:03,473
Sorry. Could you give us a hand with
the windshield? It's a bit dirty.

178
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,607
If you could...

179
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:25,234
What's up stupid?

180
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:28,411
Okay, okay... That's
it, it's over.

181
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:30,109
Don't worry about it.

182
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,501
What happened? WOMAN: Nothing, nothing...

183
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:34,069
Vicky... Looks like you
have a new admirer...

184
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:37,072
Please... how gross!

185
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,118
You realize why I
don't go in for men?

186
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:41,816
Okay, shall we go?

187
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,774
Yes, we're close.

188
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:20,898
Are you not going to pay?

189
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:23,205
Sorry, I forgot.
How much?

190
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,425
For you...

191
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,297
With that look,
a thousand pesos.

192
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:29,472
A thousand pesos?

193
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:31,431
Listen to me, fat boy...

194
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:34,129
First I caught you stealing
from the garage...

195
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,219
Then you tell me to clean the windows
like I was a maid or something...

196
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:39,656
And now you tell me how much
I should charge you?

197
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,007
Let's do this...

198
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:47,229
Why don't you stay in the garage and
I'll go partying with the bitches?

199
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:48,665
Pay him and let's go...

200
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:51,668
Pay him, Nachito...

201
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,153
You see how people understand each
other by talking things over?

202
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:03,680
Stay cool, ha...

203
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:21,959
Here are your
meat pies, you old hag!

204
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:24,560
Check it out!
What a location!

205
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:27,171
We're going to make
one hell of a documentary.

206
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,827
Yes, it's good.

207
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:34,440
Okay, are we ready
to shoot?

208
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:36,572
Let's get ready
to start shooting.

209
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,661
We don't have much time.

210
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:40,924
Okay, Okay... Vasco, calm down. Let's
set up the equipment and get started.

211
00:22:40,968 --> 00:22:43,144
Try to relax a bit
now we're here.

212
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:45,059
Are you okay?

213
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:47,670
Yeah... Really?

214
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:49,150
That was my grandmother's house.

215
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:58,333
Are we good to go? Sure, let's get moving.

216
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,204
Time to work guys! Set up
the gear and let's shoot!

217
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,911
Well, this used to be
my room...

218
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:15,785
And the dining room
was over there...

219
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:20,355
All of this area
used to be the kitchen.

220
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:26,317
Hold it... Let's stop
for a bit, Carla.

221
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:29,799
Come here, Diego. I don't know but
this scene doesn't feel right to me.

222
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:33,281
Not enough dramatic pause,
climax, tension...

223
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:36,197
If you think so, I don't
know, maybe you're right.

224
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,895
Yes, you don't feel it? A bit more, all right,
let's do it.

225
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:43,726
You know what Carla?
You seem tense...

226
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,469
A bit stiff. Relax,
take it easy...

227
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:51,038
Visualize your memories and let them speak.
Will we try it? Let's go!

228
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:56,652
Action!

229
00:23:58,698 --> 00:24:04,486
When the flood struck there were
people who didn't want to leave.

230
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:09,665
Some of them stayed until
the water was waist high.

231
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:14,017
The firefighters had to use
force to get them out...

232
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,326
When they realized there was
no other way...

233
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:26,595
Now we're talking!

234
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,597
Very good!
Excellent, bravo!

235
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:30,338
That's it, Carla!

236
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:32,906
That's the right tone! Great!

237
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:36,605
Ladies and gentlemen, the documentary has
begun. This is what I'm looking for.

238
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:40,174
- Let's take a five-minute break
and chill. - Way to go Vasco!

239
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:42,959
Sure, but let's stay on track.
We got this.

240
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:44,744
Very good!

241
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:56,625
It was really good, great.

242
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:58,105
Thanks.

243
00:24:58,148 --> 00:24:59,889
If you need anything
let me know.

244
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:01,543
Sure.

245
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

246
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:39,538
What a total jerk you are!

247
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:57,093
It worked out great.

248
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:59,139
Really? Yes, you looked fab.

249
00:26:59,966 --> 00:27:01,620
Hey,
where's Vicky?

250
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:05,014
No idea Vasco... She's your
girlfriend, how should I know...

251
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:07,190
Look! There she is.

252
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:13,762
Come here, come here,
come here...

253
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:15,111
Where were you?

254
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:16,939
Taking some photos
of the ruins.

255
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:19,986
Ah... you could've told me and we
could have taken some together.

256
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:21,161
We'll get some later.

257
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:22,858
Ah, later...

258
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:24,512
Later when?

259
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:26,296
When?

260
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:55,456
Hi, baby,
what's up with my baby?

261
00:27:56,805 --> 00:28:00,635
Hello, hello,
hello everyone...

262
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,985
Hello Vasco...

263
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:04,857
What are you doing
with my phone?

264
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:10,210
Take your phone! You were supposed
to be taking photos of the ruins.

265
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:11,385
That's your job.

266
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:13,909
You're so unprofessional.
Unbelievable...

267
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:21,917
Now what's wrong?
What is it? What's going on?

268
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:23,745
What's going on with this piece
of crap?

269
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:27,706
Hey Nacho, was this vehicle
not meant to have

270
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,230
taken you through the whole
of Latin America?

271
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:32,711
Quit the bad vibes.

272
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:36,627
Me, giving bad vibes? It's the first time
I've spoken and I'm sending bad vibes...

273
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:38,064
You don't know anything
about teamwork...

274
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,982
Fucking great.
What's going on?

275
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:45,811
Bloody fucking great!

276
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:49,858
Well done,
you asshole.

277
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:54,689
Fucking great...

278
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:09,443
Didn't I tell you that this
crappy van wasn't up to the job?

279
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:12,359
Why don't you stop breaking my
balls and give me a hand, idiot?

280
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:14,753
Look where we are!
Why don't you help me?

281
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,232
Guys, don't you smell
something strange?

282
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,629
Yup, it's leaking gas...
the hose is cut.

283
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:23,587
What's that?
What do you mean hose?

284
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:25,546
The fuel hose, Vasco!

285
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:27,417
I'm not a mechanic,
I'm a film director!

286
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:29,245
Hold these, don't fuck with me,
hold onto these, come on.

287
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:30,986
Where do you want me to go? Hold them, damn it.

288
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:34,947
I can't believe it...

289
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:40,082
Come here Nacho...

290
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:42,215
Do you have anything to fix the
hose? I can fix it.

291
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:44,695
The problem is we need gas.
Do you have any?

292
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:54,270
None. They'll have to tow it.

293
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:56,403
We need something
to fix the hose.

294
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:00,102
A spare gas can?

295
00:30:03,584 --> 00:30:05,020
It looks like
someone's coming...

296
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,840
What are you doing around here?

297
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:44,755
Nothing... We had a problem
with the van.

298
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,453
It gave up on us. Yeah?

299
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:53,329
I think it's the fuel hose.

300
00:30:55,462 --> 00:30:56,680
Let's have a look...

301
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,648
How did you say it broke? No idea...

302
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:10,869
Because this isn't broke.
Someone cut it...

303
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,392
What do you mean
someone cut it?

304
00:31:12,435 --> 00:31:14,046
Yep, they cut it.

305
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:19,965
If you want I can take you
to a gas station.

306
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:22,445
You need to get the hose
replaced.

307
00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:23,794
We can go together
if you want, Vasco.

308
00:31:23,838 --> 00:31:26,188
Sure. No, not you. You come.

309
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,843
Are you sure? Yeah, I'll go.

310
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,280
Erica take a few shots in the
cemetery to save us some time.

311
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:32,934
Okay.

312
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:34,936
Listen up. If you touch a hair
on the head of my girlfriend

313
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,546
I'll rip your head off, okay?

314
00:31:57,524 --> 00:32:00,135
Carla, is the cemetery
too far to walk?

315
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,050
Twenty minutes
more or less.

316
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:15,890
Shall we go?

317
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,109
Yeah, let's go for it.
Wait till I get the camera.

318
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,154
Get my backpack, too,
will you?

319
00:32:19,198 --> 00:32:21,983
Go on, I'll stay here
and look after the van.

320
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:24,725
Diego, I'll stay too
and wait for Vasco.

321
00:32:24,768 --> 00:32:26,988
Whatever you want...

322
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:28,772
Do you still have
any friends from Epecun?

323
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:32,254
Yes, some, a few...

324
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,693
Do you still see them?

325
00:32:36,737 --> 00:32:38,652
No, we don't meet up.

326
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:43,309
Listen, let me know if you're
not comfortable with anything...

327
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:47,226
Sure. It's all good, it's cool. You set your own limits, too,
right?

328
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:50,142
Sure, no problem.

329
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:52,883
We can break and take it to
another angle.

330
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:54,276
No, I'm okay with it.

331
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,105
Sure? It's weird to come back...

332
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:01,892
Yeah, I can see it's very
intense.

333
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:05,635
I can tell
you're remembering a lot.

334
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:13,339
Was it hard for you to adapt to a new
place, to move again? Is your family okay?

335
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:15,645
Yes, it's all good.
It wasn't so hard.

336
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,173
Sorry, would you like some?

337
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:22,739
Thanks.

338
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:23,958
It's hot.

339
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:28,441
Thanks.

340
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:30,747
You have a mustache...

341
00:33:31,748 --> 00:33:33,359
What?

342
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:06,392
Carla!

343
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:09,003
Is there far to go?

344
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,683
Hot, isn't it?

345
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:41,373
Would you like some water?

346
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:43,462
Yes.

347
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:51,034
I didn't know
you could draw so well...

348
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:56,649
Well, thanks. Still, have a long way to go
though... But yes, it's turning out nice.

349
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:51,921
What a heat... It's the
humidity that gets me...

350
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:57,710
We're making a documentary
about Epecuen.

351
00:37:57,753 --> 00:38:01,757
The plan is to present it
in Berlin next year.

352
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:04,238
There's a lot of lobbying to go.
Well, that's the idea anyway...

353
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:10,505
Don't touch that.
Leave it there.

354
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:23,883
Watch your step as you go...

355
00:40:27,816 --> 00:40:29,862
Okay, Carla,
tell us where we are.

356
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:32,212
Are we starting now? Yes, whenever you like.

357
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:38,610
This was the cemetery.
Epecuen cemetery...

358
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:42,222
Wait, can we start over?
I stumbled a bit.

359
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:46,661
Relax. Pretend neither the camera nor us
are here. Just talk about what you know.

360
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:52,275
When the water reached
the graves people panicked

361
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:58,281
because they wanted to recover
the bodies of their relatives.

362
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:04,462
Some of them started to take
advantage of the panic.

363
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:08,509
The divers that were charging
to find the bodies...

364
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:13,340
Actually just brought up
the first ones they found.

365
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:19,259
I remember my neighbor asked
them to bring back

366
00:41:19,302 --> 00:41:24,307
her three brothers
who were buried together...

367
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:29,182
They actually brought back four bodies.
She had to bury all four...

368
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:36,537
She ended up bringing flowers to
the grave of dear knows who...

369
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:45,154
Shall I continue?

370
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:48,854
No, hold it. This is great. We're good
with this if you'd like to take a break.

371
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:51,596
How's it looking?

372
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:54,903
She looks great...
Gorgeous.

373
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:57,645
Yes, I know...

374
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,295
What happened?

375
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:42,603
Holy shit! It bit me,
a snake bit me!

376
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:44,300
Give me the scarf! Wait!

377
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:46,738
It bit me... Take it easy...

378
00:42:46,781 --> 00:42:48,130
Go get the stuff! Christ, it hurts!

379
00:42:48,174 --> 00:42:49,697
We have to get to the van.

380
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:52,134
It hurts... Easy, easy...

381
00:42:52,178 --> 00:42:56,138
There you go...
Can you walk? Yes...

382
00:42:56,182 --> 00:43:03,058
Come here... That's it, keep calm...
Let's take it slowly, nice and easy...

383
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,552
Vicky, no offence, but what do
you actually see in Vasco?

384
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:23,122
Why are you asking?

385
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:25,907
I don't know... You look like the type
of girl who can pick any guy she likes.

386
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:28,780
But you're with that
character...

387
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:37,440
I don't know... He buys me
things, he takes me places...

388
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:40,530
He's also smart
and I look up to him.

389
00:43:40,574 --> 00:43:42,620
He promised me a role
in his next movie.

390
00:43:45,448 --> 00:43:47,494
He's a good guy.

391
00:43:50,802 --> 00:43:52,368
"He's a good guy."

392
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,155
I'll be right back.

393
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,727
Kiki!

394
00:44:05,294 --> 00:44:06,426
Kiki!

395
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:15,957
Kiki!

396
00:44:19,178 --> 00:44:21,920
Kiki, where are you?
Come here Kiki!

397
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:30,668
Come here my darling...
Where are you?

398
00:44:39,024 --> 00:44:43,115
Nacho, have you seen Kiki? Nope, no idea!

399
00:44:44,507 --> 00:44:46,205
Shitty dog...

400
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,997
What's that?

401
00:45:08,836 --> 00:45:10,316
What is this?

402
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:14,189
Stay here.

403
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

404
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

405
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:15,447
Keep going,
a little bit further...

406
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:20,582
You can do it, Carla. There's
the van, there it is!

407
00:50:22,715 --> 00:50:24,847
Come on Erica,
help me please.

408
00:50:24,891 --> 00:50:27,502
Nacho, Vasco!

409
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,419
Where the hell are they?

410
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:33,552
There you go...
Easy, easy...

411
00:50:38,296 --> 00:50:41,560
Grab her, grab her... Careful. Take her arm...
There you go...

412
00:50:50,395 --> 00:50:54,268
Nacho, Vasco!

413
00:50:59,012 --> 00:51:01,188
Vasco! Where are you?

414
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:05,062
Vasco!

415
00:51:05,888 --> 00:51:07,716
Nacho!

416
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:10,067
Vasco!

417
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:12,721
Nacho!

418
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:17,378
Nacho, Vasco!
Where are you?

419
00:51:19,032 --> 00:51:21,208
Fucking hell! Nacho!

420
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:49,584
No, no, no...
We have to go now, Erica.

421
00:51:50,716 --> 00:51:54,850
Hey, are you listening, Erica?

422
00:51:54,894 --> 00:51:58,680
Look. What? Easy, Carla...
What's happening?

423
00:51:58,724 --> 00:52:00,465
Hold this.

424
00:52:02,293 --> 00:52:05,774
Keep calm, everything's going to be okay.
What do you want to show me?

425
00:52:08,603 --> 00:52:09,822
Did you see that?

426
00:52:12,738 --> 00:52:13,826
Let's see... rewind it.

427
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

428
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:57,739
Must have been the guys...
it must have been.

429
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,614
Take it easy... Listen.

430
00:53:14,365 --> 00:53:18,891
Keep calm, calm, calm, Erica!
It's nothing, it's nothing!

431
00:53:21,807 --> 00:53:27,334
Hey, hey, hey.
Calm yourself down please...

432
00:53:42,915 --> 00:53:47,354
I'm going to check it out.Diego. No, no, wait, wait!

433
00:53:47,398 --> 00:53:51,793
Don't go. Eh, just relax...

434
00:53:51,837 --> 00:53:54,231
Don't go. It'll be fine,
you'll feel better.

435
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:10,611
Get me out, Diego,
get me out! I can't, I can't do it!

436
00:55:22,797 --> 00:55:26,192
Don't leave me here,
Diego, don't leave me!

437
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:28,629
Carla!

438
00:56:53,975 --> 00:56:56,325
Come on, kid. We have
to get out of here.

439
00:56:58,371 --> 00:57:00,329
Let's go...

440
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:50,858
The documentary, right?

441
00:57:50,902 --> 00:57:53,513
You want to make the
documentary, right?

442
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:55,254
Well...

443
00:57:56,168 --> 00:58:00,041
Let me introduce my family.

444
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,741
This is my little brother.

445
00:58:09,877 --> 00:58:11,923
My oldest little brother...

446
00:58:11,966 --> 00:58:15,535
I'm the oldest. But he
used to be the oldest...

447
00:58:24,892 --> 00:58:26,285
A puppy...

448
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:29,854
A puppy...

449
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:33,901
It was a little puppy
for him.

450
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:45,217
This is my nephew.
Little nephew...

451
00:59:00,188 --> 00:59:01,929
And this...

452
00:59:08,893 --> 00:59:10,721
This is Tito's.

453
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:13,680
Tito plays here...

454
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,846
And these are my things.

455
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:51,675
Nobody touches them.

456
00:59:56,201 --> 00:59:58,203
The camera is getting it right?

457
00:59:58,246 --> 01:00:00,422
It looks good, right?

458
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:02,468
Nobody touches
any of my things!

459
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,953
So you want to make
a documentary...

460
01:00:09,997 --> 01:00:11,782
You want to make
a documentary?

461
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,624
You want to make

01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,584

01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:34,848
"Lessons by Chimango."

464
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:38,635
Don't scream.

01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,612
Still!

469
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:05,531

fuckboys like you...

01:04:03,404 --> 01:04:05,537

Get out.

Will you wait for me here? Okay, Vicky?

What the fuck
did you do, kid?

509
01:18:40,063 --> 01:18:42,239
Drop the knife.

510
01:18:42,282 --> 01:18:44,807
Drop the knife.
She is so cute...

511
01:18:49,115 --> 01:18:51,248
Drop the knife
or I'll kill her...

01:18:51,857 --> 01:18:53,076

You have to go now.

Here you go. You've got a
drink, and everything you need.

517
01:19:38,599 --> 01:19:41,733
No, no, no! I beg you
please, slowly, slowly.

518
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:45,911
Be very careful. Be careful...
Don't...

519
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:52,700
Shit! I'm going to make you
crap, I'll make you crap.

520
01:19:52,744 --> 01:19:57,749
Get out of my sight! Get out of
my sight you piece of shit!,

521
01:20:03,276 --> 01:20:06,932
Well... Nothing going on here,
everything's okay here.

522
01:20:06,976 --> 01:20:09,979
What's wrong, baby? Water...

523
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:14,853
Water? You want water? Sure,
we'll give you some water.

524
01:20:14,897 --> 01:20:18,726
We don't want to
treat our guests badly...

525
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:20,816
Because we want them to
come back and recommend us.

526
01:20:20,859 --> 01:20:22,992
And we also depend on you
for our food.

527
01:20:23,035 --> 01:20:25,821
You retard,
get some water.

528
01:20:25,864 --> 01:20:28,998
You want water too?
We'll give you water.

529
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:31,000
Nobody's going to miss out
on anything.

530
01:20:41,749 --> 01:20:43,447
You know what
we're going to do now?

531
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:47,103
We're going to have a little meat
pie as you're looking very weak...

532
01:20:47,146 --> 01:20:49,975
And need to eat something.
Let's see...

533
01:20:50,019 --> 01:20:53,892
Open your mouth, baby.
Come on, come on.

534
01:20:53,936 --> 01:20:56,895
Look... a little plane.
Come on, open your mouth,

535
01:20:56,939 --> 01:20:59,942
open it, baby.
Are you not going to eat?

536
01:20:59,985 --> 01:21:03,597
I'm treating you well and giving you a pie.
Aren't you going to eat it?

537
01:21:03,641 --> 01:21:05,773
Come here,
take her, please.

538
01:21:05,817 --> 01:21:10,300
No way... You have to eat or you'll
make yourself ill, my darling.

539
01:21:10,343 --> 01:21:14,217
There you go... there you go...
Look how I'm eating the cookies.

540
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:21,354
Clean her up a bit. Look how
those guys left you...

541
01:21:21,398 --> 01:21:26,751
They treated you very badly and
that's not on. That's not fair.

542
01:21:26,794 --> 01:21:31,843
See, it's only a little, right?
Does it taste good? Is it tasty?

543
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:40,069
Tell me if it tastes good.
Yum, yum, it's good.

544
01:21:43,028 --> 01:21:46,510
Do you know what
the pie is made of?

545
01:21:46,553 --> 01:21:50,601
Twelve home-made meat pie
recipes for all the family.

546
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:02,308
Poor little girl...

547
01:22:19,151 --> 01:22:21,023
Give me that...

548
01:22:45,221 --> 01:22:49,312
Tito, don't let him get away!
Don't let him get away, Tito!

549
01:24:44,253 --> 01:24:49,345
No, no, leave him! Please leave
him alone, don't hit him again!

550
01:24:49,388 --> 01:24:53,305
He doesn't know what he's
doing, he doesn't understand.

551
01:24:53,349 --> 01:24:56,700
Just do what my grandma says.
Please leave him.

552
01:24:56,743 --> 01:25:00,530
Your grandma?
Your grandma?

553
01:25:02,967 --> 01:25:04,577
You let them kill everyone.

554
01:25:06,884 --> 01:25:09,147
You know nothing.

555
01:25:12,063 --> 01:25:14,283
We lost everything...

556
01:25:16,328 --> 01:25:19,331
We lost it all and
nobody came to help us.

557
01:25:20,463 --> 01:25:22,769
Nobody came to help us!

558
01:25:28,775 --> 01:25:30,777
They left us
to die in oblivion.

559
01:25:32,649 --> 01:25:34,303
And that's why
you're killing us all?

560
01:25:36,348 --> 01:25:38,481
There are things
worse than death...

561
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,578
Stop! Let him go! Let him go, I tell you!
Let him go

562
01:25:52,321 --> 01:25:53,452
Carla...

563
01:26:05,682 --> 01:26:07,162
Forgive me...

564
01:28:18,118 --> 01:28:19,337
Where are you going?

565
01:28:23,385 --> 01:28:24,734
To Epecuen.

566
01:29:20,224 --> 01:29:25,403
This constantly rocking boat
is passing over a cemetery.

567
01:29:25,447 --> 01:29:31,017
A cemetery that is buried here below,
at an approximate depth of 12 feet,

568
01:29:31,061 --> 01:29:33,280
from exactly seven years ago.

569
01:29:33,324 --> 01:29:36,980
Yes, the caskets came floating
out and were discovered

570
01:29:37,023 --> 01:29:39,722
over there by the banks
of the lagoon.

571
01:29:39,765 --> 01:29:43,595
What happened back in '85? What
exactly was it that happened?

572
01:29:43,639 --> 01:29:49,340
Well... The water struck quickly, and
we didn't have time to do anything.

573
01:30:09,926 --> 01:30:14,191
We're traveling across the city of Epecuen by boat.

574
01:30:14,234 --> 01:30:21,067
Look at the state of it.
It has been flooded since 1985

575
01:30:22,504 --> 01:30:24,854
The water levels here
will never go down again.

576
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:42,785
Look how the water, which
has already covered

577
01:30:42,828 --> 01:30:49,182
many of the Carhue cemetery
vaults, keeps rising.

578
01:30:49,226 --> 01:30:53,491
Or rather, what used
to be the cemetery.

579
01:30:53,535 --> 01:30:57,452
The current is really very strong.
There is a strong south-easterly wind

580
01:30:57,495 --> 01:31:03,109
blowing and whipping
across the city of Carhue.
