00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,333
<i>Attention, all you</i>
<i>trick-or-treaters,</i>

2
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:37,269
it's time to get your ghoul on,

3
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:40,372
for tonight is
All Hallow's Eve,

4
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,808
my favorite time of the year.

5
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,279
<i>Our little town really</i>
<i>comes alive on October 31st,</i>

6
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,282
<i>when witches and devils,</i>
<i>imps and monsters</i>

7
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,284
<i>roam our town.</i>

8
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,429
<i>As the holiday</i>
<i>activities begin,</i>

9
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,199
<i>the streets are filled</i>
<i>with all kinds</i>

10
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,534
<i>of creatures of the night.</i>

11
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:26,271
<i>Some wear masks to disguise</i>
<i>their dark intentions,</i>

12
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:29,341
<i>while others choose</i>
<i>to hide in plain sight.</i>

13
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:32,511
<i>So warning to those of you</i>
<i>collecting your treats</i>

14
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,513
<i>and filling your bellies.</i>

15
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,582
<i>Keep your wits about you</i>

16
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:39,551
<i>and don't forget</i>
<i>to check your candy.</i>

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hey, Mikey, slow down.
You're gonna
make yourself sick.
Oh!

18
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,457
What'd I miss?

19
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,759
Just Mikey being
a human garbage disposal.

20
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,427
Ooh, I see.

21
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,266
Seriously, Mikey, you better
save some for Sweet Tooth.

22
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,902
Who's Sweet Tooth?

23
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,376
About 50 years ago,

24
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:39,711
Timothy Blake
lived on this very street.

25
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:43,615
Timmy loved Halloween.

26
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,384
He loved to dress up.

27
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:48,720
Most of all,
he loved trick-or-treating.

28
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:52,024
But he was always sad
when he had to go home.

29
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,694
But that's the best part.

30
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,830
That's when you get
to eat all the candy.

31
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,533
Not for Timmy.

32
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,469
See, Timmy's parents
were really strict.

33
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,004
They would let him go out
trick-or-treating,

34
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:10,642
but they never let him
eat any of the candy.

35
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,388
They said eating candy
would make him fat and lazy

36
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,457
and rot his teeth.

37
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:35,000
Go to your room, son.

38
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,002
Why let him go
trick-or-treating then

39
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,737
if he couldn't have any candy?

40
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,739
What do they do with it all?

41
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,108
That's exactly
what Timmy wanted to know.

42
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,810
So one Halloween,

43
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,346
Timmy snuck downstairs
to find out.

44
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:04,429
Where'd he get all this?
Did you find it?

45
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,719
Mmm! Mmm!

46
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,672
Suck on this!

47
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:52,444
There's my candy bar!

48
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,479
What did he do?

49
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,191
No!

50
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,632
No, no, no!

51
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:16,435
After he killed his parents,

52
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:19,504
Timmy finally had
his first piece of candy.

53
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,809
He was hooked.

54
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:27,145
He ate every last piece
his parents hadn't.

55
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,214
- But...
- What?

56
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,183
He wanted more.

57
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:33,919
But there wasn't any left.

58
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,722
Yes, there was.

59
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,062
No way.

60
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,798
Timmy ate all the candy
he could find

61
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,934
inside his parents, but...

62
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:52,237
- What?
- He wanted more.

63
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:57,976
Now every Halloween,
every single Halloween since,

64
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,713
his evil spirit comes back
trick-or-treating.

65
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,849
If you don't share
your candy with him,

66
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,751
he will come and take it,
all of it,

67
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,054
even the candy
you've already eaten.

68
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:13,625
Anything to satisfy
his sweet tooth.

69
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,709
Lizzy, is it true
what Kyle said?

70
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,645
It was just a story, Mikey.
He was just trying to scare you.

71
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,615
He's a douchebag.

72
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,617
Get some sleep.

73
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>As long as they have you...</i>

74
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,685
- What are you doing?
- Celebrating.

75
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,921
I think Mikey
almost shit his pants.

76
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,589
Thanks for the assist.

77
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,058
We'll be lucky if he gets
any sleep tonight.

78
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,693
I think we might have
taken it too far.

79
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,695
Come on, Liz.

80
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:26,064
The Sweet Tooth story's
a Halloween tradition.

81
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,334
Every kid in town falls for it.
It's like a rite of passage.

82
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:33,972
I know, but you didn't
have to be such a...

83
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,173
An awesome guy?

84
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,576
A douchebag.

85
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,644
His words, not mine.

86
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,014
Peace offering?

87
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,639
<i>Trick or treat.</i>

88
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:54,352
<i>Get out in that field.</i>
<i>It could be a barn fire.</i>

89
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,921
Oh, my God.
I can't believe we ate it all.

90
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,157
I feel sick.

91
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,892
Where you going?

92
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:04,262
I'm going to get some Pepto
before we both get sick.

93
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,366
Better hurry.

94
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,769
You know we are going
to have to get more candy.

95
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,771
Don't say the C-word.

96
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,207
<i>Hit him in the head,</i>
<i>right between the eyes.</i>

97
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,951
<i>Good shot.</i>

98
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,887
<i>Okay, he's dead.</i>
<i>Let's go get him.</i>

99
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,289
<i>That's another one</i>
<i>for the fire.</i>

100
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,072
Trick or treat.

101
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,741
Mikey?

102
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,253
I'm coming! I'm coming!

103
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,089
Don't puke! Don't puke!

104
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,092
You gonna live?

105
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,763
You better get going.

106
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,765
Mikey's parents
will be home soon.

107
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,735
Kyle.

108
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:17,802
Kyle!

109
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,117
Trick or treat.

Mikey!

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

112
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,139
I'm too tired.

113
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,975
- I don't wanna drive her home.
- I don't eith...

114
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,545
- Whoa!
- Jesus, Mikey.

115
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,446
Don't yell at him tonight.
It's Halloween.

116
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,049
- I'm too drunk to yell at him.
- Trick or treat, by the way.

117
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,184
Trick or treat.

118
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,919
- Do you want a treat?
- Yes.

119
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:44,155
- Do you want a treat from me?
- I want a trick first.

120
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,191
- What about the babysitter?
- Okay, okay, shh.

121
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:49,260
I'm gonna keep this thing on.
I promise you that, okay?

122
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:52,197
Absolutely you can tuck me in.

123
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,209
They ate all of my candy.

124
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,021
I can't believe I let you
talk me into this.

125
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,257
It's 3 p.m., and we're
dressed like assholes.

126
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,893
I can talk you into anything
I want dressed like this.

127
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,595
Gross! I'm right here.

128
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:26,030
You mad that your sister
took your costume, bud?

129
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,298
How can you even breathe
in that thing?

130
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,033
It's 100 fucking degrees
outside.

131
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,269
- You get used to it.
- Leave him alone, Todd.

132
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,339
- He likes his dorky outfit.
- Oh, my God, Billy!

133
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,975
I am an idiot.
I totally forgot to ask.

134
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:39,010
- Did your mother dress up?
- What?

135
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,412
Is your mother in a slutty
costume like your sister?

136
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,214
- Hey!
- What?

137
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,616
You remember your mom
brought you to school

138
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,317
in that Catwoman
outfit one year?

139
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,319
- We still talk about it.
- You're such a pig.

140
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,288
Can't we just go
trick-or-treating?

141
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,957
Is he special?
It's not even dark yet.

142
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,393
Plus, I think it's time you do
Halloween like the big kids.

143
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,029
Todd, don't. Do we have
to do this every year?

144
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,298
- Do what?
- Pranks.

145
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,934
Do the tricks
and get the treats.

146
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,435
With us, tonight.

147
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,104
Billy, you love candy, right?

148
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,273
- Yeah.
- And you also love Halloween

149
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,408
'cause you're dressed like
a retarded six-year-old

150
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,210
from<i> Leave it to Beaver,</i>
no offense.

151
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:15,246
But you know who doesn't
love Halloween?

152
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,581
Your next-door neighbor.

153
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,583
He has to watch you
spaz out every year.

154
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,085
And does he even
put up any decorations

155
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,456
or leave the lights on
or leave out a bowl of candy?

156
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,192
No way.
Why would we egg anyone?

157
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,929
Why do you think
kids tag his house every year?

158
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,964
I mean, it's been going on
for as long as I can remember.

159
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,966
- It's a Halloween tradition.
- It kind of is.

160
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:37,001
I actually started
when I was about your age too.

161
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,970
Plus, if you don't,
I will tell everyone

162
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,071
that you pissed your pants.

163
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,506
But I don't pee...

164
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,075
No one else will know that,
Captain Pisspants.

165
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,617
But I don't pee in my pants.

166
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,686
Really? Fine.

167
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,254
Go. Up there.

168
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,630
Oh, my God.

169
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,632
- Oh, shoot!
- Holy shit, run.

170
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,237
Oh, shit!

171
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,340
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

172
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:18,376
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

173
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,411
Nice costume.

174
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,524
I didn't...
I mean, I had no idea.

175
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:38,396
No idea that what?

176
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,498
That you terrible children

177
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,535
have been destroying
my home for years?

178
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,171
He said... They told me it was
a Halloween tradition to prank.

179
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,373
Quiet!

180
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,076
Young man...

181
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,378
tonight...

182
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,447
you are going to learn...

183
00:16:56,449 --> 00:17:03,287
what a real Halloween prank is.

184
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,622
By the way, Billy,

185
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,657
is your mother dressing up
again this year?

186
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,726
Hmm?

187
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:26,210
Yeah!

188
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,580
Ladies, Happy Halloween.

189
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,084
Ooh.

190
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,090
Meow!

191
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:42,760
Boo! Boo!

192
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,128
Come on.

193
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,764
Ohh...

194
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,076
Happy Hallo... ween.

195
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,515
Candy rots your teeth.
Can't have that, can we?

196
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:05,717
- Ugh!
- Don't forget to floss!

197
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,785
What an asshole.

198
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,613
Happy Halloween!

199
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,901
- What the hell?
- Hey!

200
00:18:56,903 --> 00:19:00,771
- Billy, what the hell, man?
- Billy, you little shit!

201
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,640
What are you doing?
Is that gasoline?

202
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,375
Are you joking me?

203
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,417
What are you doing out here
by yourself?

204
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:10,314
It's not funny!

205
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,349
It is not funny!

206
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,413
Hey, give me the candy!

207
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,282
Hold that.

208
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,550
He's got a gun!

209
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:48,953
That's it!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

210
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,856
Go, go, go!
Get the trick-or-treater!

211
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,291
Get 'em, kid!

212
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,203
It's tight! Tight in the shirt!

213
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,471
- It's a heart attack.
- Oh, my God.

214
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,841
Are you okay?

215
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,849
- Aren't you Adrianne Curry?
- Yes.

216
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,752
Ooh! Might I have
your autograph?

217
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,754
Big fan, big fan!

218
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,556
Okay.

219
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,260
Thank you.

220
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,497
Adrianne Curry!

221
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,535
How many Twitter followers
do you have?

222
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,437
500 thousand?

223
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,306
500 thousand and one.

224
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,285
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em!

225
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:17,408
Shh.

226
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:35,926
Ah! I guess we'll
come back again.

227
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:39,330
Good going, buddy!

228
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:46,804
Excellent work back there,
Mordecai.

229
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:50,775
Now if you'd be so kind
as to untie our guest.

230
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,312
What? I thought
you were gonna show me

231
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,746
what a real
Halloween prank was.

232
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:58,616
Oh, I believe I did.

233
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:04,055
And I believe you'll find
some visitors at your home.

234
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:10,661
Why don't you just
run along now, little boy?

235
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:14,865
You know, your mother's going
to have a lot more free time

236
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,901
on her hands now.

237
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:20,838
I just want you to know
that I plan to be here for her.

238
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,083
Freeze! Let me see your hands!

239
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:34,885
- Get on the ground!
- Hands behind your head!

240
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,088
- Don't you move.
- Did you just pee yourself?

241
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,090
He just peed himself!

242
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:40,933
What the hell's wrong with you?

243
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:49,033
<i>I wonder what happened</i>
<i>to the ones from last year.</i>

244
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,469
<i>Each year we spend good money</i>
<i>on these things,</i>

245
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:54,605
<i>come out here, and the ones</i>
<i>from last year's gone.</i>

246
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:56,140
<i>Flowers die.</i>

247
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,943
<i>The caretaker or somebody</i>
<i>takes them away.</i>

248
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:01,579
<i>Yeah, a little spit</i>
<i>and polish will clean this up.</i>

249
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:04,815
Hey, hey, check this one out.

250
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,017
Awesome, huh?

251
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,819
You're disgusting!

252
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:11,055
Shh! There's a movie on.

253
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,634
Trick or treat!

254
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,069
Oh, wow. Here you go.

255
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,470
- Aww!
- Thank you!

256
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:27,872
You look great.

257
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,877
Why are there so many
pirates this year?

258
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,579
It's like every other kid's
got an eyepatch.

259
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,548
Maybe they're all missing eyes.

260
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,417
You're so bad.

261
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,987
Bunch of gimpy kids
with peg legs and patches.

262
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,922
Give me some candy, matey!

263
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,792
- You're stupid.
<i>- They're coming to get you!</i>

264
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:51,529
- Your turn.
- Man!

265
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:52,630
Go.

266
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:54,131
Fine, fine, fine.

267
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,933
<i>You're acting like a child!</i>

268
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,169
<i>They're coming for you!</i>

269
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:01,539
<i>Look! There comes</i>
<i>one of them now.</i>

270
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,908
<i>- He'll hear you.</i>
<i>- Here he comes.</i>

271
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,176
<i>I'm getting out.</i>

272
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,646
Can you say trick-or-treat?

273
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:11,482
Hey, there, princess.

274
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,451
What do you say, huh?

275
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:14,819
Ah, that-a-girl.

276
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,923
Hey, you want some
rum and cider?

277
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:20,157
No, thanks.

278
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,026
Cheers!

279
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,062
Bye,

280
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:35,005
Change your mind already, huh?

281
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,541
Ah, it's a witch. Awesome.

282
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,777
Trick or treat?

283
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:41,545
Nelson, you're drunk.

284
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:42,947
She's supposed to say that.

285
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,115
Dummy.

286
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,521
Trick or treat?

287
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,698
Trick.

288
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,541
Nelson.

289
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:11,775
Nelson?

290
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,878
Nelson!

291
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,045
What's wrong?

292
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,680
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?

293
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,015
What's wrong?

294
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,085
Baby, baby! What? Oh, my...

295
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:22,887
What the fuck?

296
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,055
It was the girl!

297
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,925
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

298
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,163
What the hell?

299
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,900
- What's wrong? I'll call 911!
- We've gotta get to a hospital!

300
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:37,301
What are you guys,
fucking idiots?

301
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:39,303
Give me my purse,
and I'll get the car.

302
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,573
Nelson, stay with me, baby!

303
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,126
Fuck!

304
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Goddamn it!
Fuck!

305
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,573
No.

306
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,193
Oh, my God! Oh, my fucking God!

307
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:37,728
Where's the car?

308
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,268
- What the fuck happened?
- The little kid!

309
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,975
What? What is it?

310
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Maria, she...
- What?
- Oh, shit. Holy shit!

311
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,912
No.

312
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,319
Please don't. Please.

313
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,223
Happy Halloween,
you fucking sicko.

314
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,391
No!

315
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,876
<i>Now here's a tale</i>
<i>for all you hood rats</i>

316
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:47,477
<i>over there across town</i>

317
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:50,247
<i>on the wrong side</i>
<i>of the tracks.</i>

318
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:53,183
<i>Keep your heads up</i>
<i>and your butts down</i>

319
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,253
<i>'cause the weak need</i>
<i>all the help they can get</i>

320
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:58,255
<i>when the wicked</i>
<i>come out to ride</i>

321
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:00,524
<i>on All Hallow's Eve.</i>

322
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:05,295
Mmm!

323
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,175
No, no. Wait, wait, guys.

324
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:20,477
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

325
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,879
Wait.

326
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:29,152
Ain't you a little old
for Halloween candy, Sheriff?

327
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,479
Show me piggy's trotters.

328
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,348
Please, Alice, please, please,
please, please.

329
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,284
Alice, please.

330
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:03,053
Alice, guys, hang on, hang on.

331
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,623
No, no, no, wait. Wait, wait.

332
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,626
I know you, stranger?

333
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,337
It spills the blood
of the wicked

334
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:03,140
where the wicked
have harmed the weak.

335
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:07,344
Think you turned yourself into
a monster with that suit, boy?

336
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,622
Ah!

337
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:34,771
Mount up.

338
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,350
Mom?

339
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,952
Dad?

340
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,821
You'd be little Jimmy Henson.

341
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,661
They didn't do nothing to you.

342
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,232
Hold him down.

343
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:43,360
When the word is carved
in flesh, the call is sent.

344
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:46,396
Return them to the location
of their offense.

345
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:47,530
Punch him!

346
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,621
You know...

347
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,791
it's kinda poetic, really.

348
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,795
You...

349
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,034
us...

350
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,674
together...

351
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:35,312
on All Hallow's Eve!

352
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,756
There are no monsters here.

353
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,660
Just me.

354
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:44,981
Spirits roam the earth tonight.

355
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:47,450
Do you know why wear
costumes on Halloween?

356
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,890
It's so the dead
won't know who's alive.

357
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,525
Their night.
And while some of them

358
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:58,628
like mingling with the living,

359
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:04,067
there are others who don't
like to be seen at all.

360
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:10,039
There's one ghost who hates it
more than any of the others.

361
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:16,446
Mary Bailey was laughed at
her whole life.

362
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:20,784
She died being bullied
and unloved.

363
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:25,889
All because she had
a disfigured face.

364
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:31,127
But now it's her turn
to have the last laugh.

365
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:36,132
She comes back every Halloween
to taunt the living

366
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,668
and to laugh at them
behind their backs.

367
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:45,074
So just a word of warning
tonight.

368
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:50,046
If you find yourself alone
on the way back,

369
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:53,049
and you hear an evil cackle

370
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,952
and footsteps behind you,

371
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,221
I wouldn't turn around

372
00:40:58,223 --> 00:41:02,692
because if she
finds you looking,

373
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:06,596
when you least expect it,

374
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,231
she's gonna take your eyes.

375
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:12,669
Boo!

376
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:15,171
Very funny. Good one, you guys.

377
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:17,240
We never miss a chance
to make you jump.

378
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:18,608
God bless 'em.

379
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,876
You're all in on it, huh?

380
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:21,644
Well, we couldn't resist.

381
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,113
You scare so easily!

382
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,849
You're lucky it's Halloween.

383
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:30,086
Cheers, my baby.

384
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,154
Mom.

385
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,956
Let's have a drink!

386
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,095
- Are you good to drive?
- Oh, yeah.

387
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:42,866
I'm not that far,
and I'm not that drunk.

388
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:44,834
What are you... Oh!

389
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,836
Are you still driving
that piece of crap?

390
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,004
- I love that piece of crap.
- Good night.

391
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,006
- Oh, bye, guys.
- Lovely party.

392
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:53,209
- Thank you.
- Bye.

393
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,612
All right, well, thank you for
coming to the Halloween party.

394
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:59,949
Oh, come on, I know how much
this means to you.

395
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,684
Well, all right.

396
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,653
Mmm.

397
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,622
- Good night, Mom.
- Drive safe.

398
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:07,056
I will.

399
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:08,758
See you before next year.

400
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,827
Yeah! Duh!

401
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,667
<i>A song to get you</i>
<i>to the other side</i>

402
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:19,802
<i>of the witching hour.</i>

403
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,098
Oh, God.

404
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:52,869
Oh, shit.

405
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,705
Okay.

406
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,715
Oh, come on.

407
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:08,084
Shit!

408
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,789
Oh, God.

409
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,290
Shit.

410
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:16,259
Oh, shit.

411
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:17,927
Ah...

412
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,762
Let's see.

413
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,898
Oh, shit!

414
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,679
Oh, shit.

415
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

416
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,696
Ugh!

417
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:29,032
Mary Bailey bullshit!

418
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:13,109
Don't look, don't look,
don't look.

419
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,396
Huh.

420
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,464
Ohh!

421
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:45,301
Baby, you scared Mommy!
What are you doing?

422
00:47:04,022 --> 00:47:08,090
What is it, Baby?
What are you looking at?

423
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,029
Baby?

424
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:15,031
Where you going?

425
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Ohh...

426
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,496
Trick or treat!

427
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:02,345
Look at all those children
out there.

428
00:48:02,347 --> 00:48:04,480
It's not fair.

429
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:08,885
I know, honey.

430
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,453
But look.

431
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,891
Trick or treat.

432
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:21,297
- What are you doing, Jack?
- I don't know. I thought...

433
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:24,100
Dressing our dog up
like Rapunzel

434
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:26,335
would make me forget
that we don't have a child?

435
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:29,105
- Gretel.
- What?

436
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:32,408
She's supposed to be
Gretel, you know?

437
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,943
Like Hansel and Gretel?

438
00:49:02,974 --> 00:49:05,408
Where is my child?!

439
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

440
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:31,300
<i>I couldn't give her</i>
<i>what she wanted.</i>

441
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:34,503
<i>Where is my child?!</i>

442
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:38,708
Tonight we embrace
the situation, Jack.

443
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,644
No hiding in the dark.
We're gonna have fun.

444
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:44,747
We need to have fun.

445
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:48,084
This isn't gonna upset you,
is it, honey?

446
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:50,720
Why would adorable children
coming to our door upset me?

447
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:59,261
Trick or treat!

448
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:01,630
Well, hello,
my little pretties.

449
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,566
And what are we supposed to be?

450
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:05,568
- Witch!
- I'm the devil.

451
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:06,602
Alien.

452
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:08,404
Oh, you are, are you?

453
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:09,505
Well, pleasantries aside,

454
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,740
I assume you're here for candy.

455
00:50:10,742 --> 00:50:12,208
Yeah.

456
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,744
Good! Hansel here
has lots of candy.

457
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:17,513
But we've been using it
to fatten him up,

458
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,015
so I can eat him,

459
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:21,584
just like I ate
his little sister Gretel.

460
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,660
Eww.

461
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:33,596
I ate her ear last,

462
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:35,798
so she could hear herself
be eaten.

463
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,403
Hansel?

464
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:45,474
Uh, would you like
some of mein candies?

465
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,186
Don't forget your line.

466
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:01,524
Trick or treat!

467
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:04,560
I ate her ear last,
so she could hear me chew.

468
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,318
Maybe we should
call it a night.

469
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,653
You know, go to bed early,
forget about all this.

470
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:16,232
Why do you make me do it?

471
00:52:16,234 --> 00:52:18,300
I don't mean to.

472
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:25,741
Aren't they just so darn cute?

473
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:27,643
I could just eat them up.

474
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,881
I'm gonna make cookies!

475
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:51,934
Maybe we just have
bad luck, Jack.

476
00:52:51,936 --> 00:52:54,470
Or maybe I'm pregnant
right now,

477
00:52:54,472 --> 00:52:57,439
and we just don't even know it.

478
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,622
Happy Halloween!

479
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,939
There, there.

480
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Are you lost, little one?
I can take you
back to the sidewalk
to help you look
for your mother.

481
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,651
It's okay. Come inside?

482
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:44,453
It's safe in there.

483
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,625
Is this one yours?

484
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,395
Toby?

485
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,766
I told you not to run away
like that.

486
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:02,972
Thank you.

487
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,967
What's wrong with me, Jack?

488
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:34,049
Maybe people like us
shouldn't have kids.

489
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:39,842
The things you do to me,

490
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:41,977
the way you hurt me,

491
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:44,513
I couldn't let you do that
to a child.

492
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:46,415
I saw a doctor,

493
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:48,817
and he made it so that
I couldn't give you one.

494
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,424
I'm sorry.

495
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,534
You...

496
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:27,723
Please!

497
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:28,724
No!

498
00:55:43,074 --> 00:55:46,742
I'm melting!

499
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:35,157
Whoo!

500
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:39,928
Aaahh!

501
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:34,082
<i>Who dares disturb</i>
<i>the sleep of the dead?</i>

502
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:36,785
<i>I'm guessing you guys.</i>

503
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:40,756
<i>What the hell?</i>

504
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,673
- That's enough.
<i>- That's enough.</i>

505
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:10,619
We need a little bit more
black over on this.

506
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:13,155
What?

507
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:16,592
Hey, Dr. Cadaverino!
How you doin'?

508
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:18,727
- Would you turn the music down?
- What?

509
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:19,962
I'm sorry.
It's a little loud out here.

510
00:58:19,964 --> 00:58:24,199
I would like you
to turn the music down.

511
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:27,970
Oh, I'd like to help you out,
but it's fucking Halloween!

512
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:29,271
My favorite holiday.

513
00:58:29,273 --> 00:58:31,006
It's a sacred holiday.

514
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,542
Exactly! You get it, right?

515
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:36,612
Look at you, with that whole
undead Dr. Nosferatu thing

516
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:37,880
you got going on.

517
00:58:37,882 --> 00:58:39,615
You really threw down
with that, man.

518
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:42,918
Look, you knew...

519
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,923
I have been doing this display
exactly as-is

520
00:58:47,925 --> 00:58:50,692
for the past 20 years.

521
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:54,029
Yeah, we can tell.

522
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,132
Would you please
turn the music down!

523
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:59,968
And you, it's after dark.
Close the dairy.

524
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:01,937
Fuck off, old man.

525
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:05,941
Whoa, dude, monster up!
Don't be such a party pooper.

526
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:07,309
This is what's beautiful.

527
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:10,145
This is what's been lost

528
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:14,316
because of you... and this.

529
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:18,153
I like what you did
over there, man.

530
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:21,557
You're like a cute little
kiddie show.

531
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:23,559
Like a spooky daycare.

532
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:28,730
Yeah! That's the spirit!

533
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:46,281
Hey, asshole!

534
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:50,619
Of course you realize
this means war.

535
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:55,157
No! Don't do it!

536
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,201
Fight, everybody!

537
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:09,738
Do you know what would perk up
this candy-ass display?

538
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,773
Some motherfucking blood.

539
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:15,110
No!

540
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:21,683
You got him! Kick his ass, man!

541
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:40,769
Hey, hey, I got 20 bucks

01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:42,638
20 bucks! 20 bucks!

- Yeah!

546
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,087
Yeah! Get him, baby!

01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,253
Oh, shit.

<i>In olden days, on this night,</i>

552
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:40,088

You don't have to do this!
No! No!

No more.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

577

Huh?

578
01:06:47,204 --> 01:06:47,704
Uh...

Trick or treat.

582
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:36,271
<i>Are you kids still up,</i>

583
01:09:36,273 --> 01:09:38,673

<i>The night isn't over,</i>

<i>So here's a little something</i>
<i>to keep you company.</i>

586
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,351
Mask.

587
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:54,622
Why do I gotta be the princess?

588
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:56,257
'Cause we only have two masks,

589
01:09:56,259 --> 01:09:59,260
and I sure as shit ain't
going as a princess.

590
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:01,663
Here he comes. Get ready.

591
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:11,339
Oh, boy, can you imagine
what it's like

592
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:13,441
to have your daddy
as a millionaire?

593
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:15,543
Just dad.

594
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,212
Look at the spoiled little brat.

595
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:23,918
Robbing banks is one thing.
I don't know about kidnapping.

596
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:28,423
Oh, my God. Seriously, Dutch.

597
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:29,691
Please don't give me
that moral bullshit.

598
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:31,459
We're not gonna hurt him.

599
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:33,895
And Rex Enterprise is gonna
handle the measly ransom,

600
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:35,597
believe me.

601
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,367
You know, if we're
gonna do this,

602
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:40,835
our window is right now.

603
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:42,270
We're never going to get
a better opportunity...

604
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,571
All right, shut up.
Just shut up!

605
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:44,706
Let's just do this.

606
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:47,342
All right.

607
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:02,690
Oh, you're such a cutie.

608
01:11:02,692 --> 01:11:04,759
I love your costume.

609
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,629
There you go. Have fun.
Happy Halloween!

610
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:13,735
Trick or treat.

611
01:11:13,737 --> 01:11:15,737
Aren't you a little old
for trick-or-treating?

612
01:11:15,739 --> 01:11:17,405
You're never too old
for sugar, mama.

613
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:18,806
Get lost!

614
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,819
Hello, kid.

615
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:34,956
Don't scream, don't run.
We won't hurt ya.

616
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:40,461
I'm not here to steal
your fucking candy, kid.

617
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:52,974
Well, I must say, that was...
That's pretty easy.

618
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:55,076
Well, why wouldn't it be?
It's a solid plan.

619
01:11:55,078 --> 01:11:58,046
Now for the fun part.

620
01:11:58,048 --> 01:12:01,616
Hey, kid, you've done
really good so far,

621
01:12:01,618 --> 01:12:04,585
so what we're gonna do right now
is we're gonna call your daddy.

622
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:08,456
And if he asks to talk to you,
I need you to say,

623
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:13,628
"Hi, Daddy. Um, I'm fine."

624
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:14,762
Okay? Got it?

625
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:20,068
Hey! Give me that!

626
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:22,103
Hey, behave.

627
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:23,404
Behave.

628
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,676
Make the call.

629
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:41,889
<i>Hello.</i>

630
01:12:41,891 --> 01:12:44,792
- Jebediah Rex?
<i>- Speaking.</i>

631
01:12:44,794 --> 01:12:47,128
Listen to me very carefully,
Mr. Rex. We have your son.

632
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:49,564
If you ever want to
see him alive again,

633
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:51,833
you're gonna do
exactly as I say.

634
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:53,468
<i>You have Rusty?</i>

635
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:55,636
That's right.
For five million Benjamins,

636
01:12:55,638 --> 01:12:57,105
you get your precious Rusty
back.

637
01:12:57,107 --> 01:13:00,074
<i>You've made a terrible mistake.</i>

638
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:03,077
You're in no position
to make threats, Mr. Rex.

639
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:06,514
<i>You poor bastard, you have</i>
<i>no idea what you've done.</i>

640
01:13:06,516 --> 01:13:09,384
No, I think I... Hello?

641
01:13:09,386 --> 01:13:12,787
What the fuck?
Did he just hang up on me?

642
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:15,590
Call him back.

643
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:17,725
Okay.

644
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:27,869
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello.

645
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:30,838
Um, why did you hang up on me?

646
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:34,475
Because we're negotiating the
release of your son, Mr. Rex.

647
01:13:34,477 --> 01:13:37,044
<i>Not interested.</i>
<i>Do not call this number again.</i>

648
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:39,046
Okay, listen to me.
I'm not playing around with you.

649
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:41,182
What the fuck?

650
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:45,119
Oh, shit.

651
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:48,456
Lock the door! Lock the door!

652
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,664
Come on out, kid.

653
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:00,968
I'm gonna count to five.

654
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:07,442
If your little punk ass
doesn't come out,

655
01:14:07,444 --> 01:14:09,710
you're gonna be
all kinds of sorry.

656
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,054
One.

657
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:23,891
Two.

658
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:27,662
Three.

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Four.
All right, here we go.

660
01:14:38,675 --> 01:14:40,141
O-O-Okay! Uh...

661
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:43,144
Get him off me!
Get him off me! Fuck!

662
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,915
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

663
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:49,517
Oh, what the...

664
01:14:57,861 --> 01:15:00,795
It's not a fucking kid!

665
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:11,873
Oh, shit.

666
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:14,575
No, no. no.

667
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:17,178
Ah! Ah!

668
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,014
No!

669
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,950

- No! No, no!

670
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:24,252
Shit.

Fuck! Come on!

01:15:27,824 --> 01:15:29,704
Hey, come on, kid,
come on, kid.

673
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:32,159
Fuck!

674
01:15:37,267 --> 01:15:40,568
I'm gonna fucking kill you,
you little shit!

675
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:45,806
Ow!

676
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:02,823
What are we gonna do
with this thing?

677
01:16:02,825 --> 01:16:04,792
Oh, I've got an idea.

678
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:28,683
Wait, I... Fuck, I can't...

679
01:16:28,685 --> 01:16:30,751
I can't... I can't do this.

680
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:34,722
You can't do what?
Are you kidding me?

681
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:38,659
My nuts were viciously assaulted
by a monster, dude.

682
01:16:38,661 --> 01:16:41,362
What kind of a monster
cries like that?

683
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:44,599
I'm just gonna check on him.
I'm gonna check on him.

684
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:50,771
Fuck!

685
01:16:58,046 --> 01:16:59,880
Problem solved.

686
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:09,724
Promise we'll never
speak of this again.

687
01:17:09,726 --> 01:17:11,626
For one, it's fucking
humiliating.

688
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:13,394
Two, I don't believe
that I was fucking there.

689
01:17:13,396 --> 01:17:15,963
I agree. Let's just pretend
like it never hap...

690
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,665
What the hell?

691
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,701
What?

692
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,242
What is it?

693
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,792
What is it?

694
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:46,994
Shh.

695
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:50,131
Oh...

696
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:55,236
No. Ohh! Ohh!

697
01:17:55,238 --> 01:17:57,104
Oh, no!

698

Hello.

699
01:17:58,374 --> 01:18:00,408
Hey, hello, it's me again.

700
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:02,843
Um... Please take him back.

701
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:04,245
<i>I don't think so.</i>

702
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:06,747
I'm begging you, please,
just take him back.

703
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:08,082
<i>He's your problem now.</i>

704
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:09,383
Come on, man!
Just name your price!

705
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:11,052
Anything you want! Please!

706
01:18:11,054 --> 01:18:12,153
<i>Don't you get it?</i>

707
01:18:12,155 --> 01:18:14,355
<i>I'm finally free. It...</i>

708

<i>trick-or-treating</i>
<i>and would not leave.</i>

710
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:21,195
Okay, so let me
ask you a question.

711
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:23,898
Why the hell did you pretend
like it was your son, man?

712
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,200
- What were you thinking?
- He's not your son!

713
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,468
He's not your son!

714
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:30,137
We've been held hostage
this whole time.

715
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:32,707
- What the fuck?
- He'll never let you go, ever.

716
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:36,343
By the way,
make sure you feed him,

717
01:18:36,345 --> 01:18:37,745
or he will eat.

718
01:18:37,747 --> 01:18:39,847
Oh! Oh, he's gonna eat!

719
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:43,751
Oh, that's great! Thanks!
You're an asshole!

720
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:06,373
Trick or treat, asshole.

721
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:18,052
Okay, all right.

722
01:19:18,054 --> 01:19:20,755
I say we drive
till the sun comes up,

723
01:19:20,757 --> 01:19:22,790
and then we just
drive a lot more.

724
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:25,459
Fuck this town.
Fuck everybody in it.

725
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:27,795
Fuck kidnapping, bro, right?

726
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:29,396
Amen to that.

727
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:50,084
Here you go, Dutch,
you lazy bastard.

728
01:19:50,086 --> 01:19:52,419
Sorry, princess,
no strawberry shakes.

729
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:42,369
Ta-da! I give you
my masterpiece.

730
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:45,139
Yeah, it's not bad.

731
01:20:45,141 --> 01:20:46,540
Come on. We have to get ready
for the party.

732
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:47,908
I just gotta clean up in here.

733
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:49,577
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

734
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:10,564
Honey, you ready?

735
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:17,371
Ray!

736
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:20,274
What the fuck?

737
01:21:20,276 --> 01:21:22,309
Ray!

738
01:21:22,311 --> 01:21:23,410
Stop it!

739
01:21:23,412 --> 01:21:25,446
No!

740
01:21:25,448 --> 01:21:26,447
No!

741
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:28,649
Ray!

742
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:37,424
No!

743
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:57,311
Detective McNally,
am I glad you're here.

744
01:21:57,313 --> 01:22:00,281
- So what have we got?
- It's a nasty one.

745
01:22:00,283 --> 01:22:03,250
Apparently the husband got
his head bitten clean off.

746
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:04,485
Bitten? By what?

747
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:06,487
I don't know. An animal maybe?

748
01:22:06,489 --> 01:22:08,322
The wife's pretty shook up,

749
01:22:08,324 --> 01:22:10,364
but she's inside
with the sketch artist.

750
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:21,702
Oh, jeez.
Reminds me of the case

751
01:22:21,704 --> 01:22:24,238
of the man who stuck
his head in a blender.

752
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,507
Talk about making a meal of it.

753
01:22:26,509 --> 01:22:29,343
- Has Forensic Bob seen this?
- He's all over it.

754
01:22:29,345 --> 01:22:32,346
- Where's the wife?
- Through here.

755
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:42,656
Ma'am, my name's
Detective McNally,

756
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:45,225
and I want to assure you I will
do everything within my power

757
01:22:45,227 --> 01:22:47,661
to bring this killer
to justice.

758
01:22:47,663 --> 01:22:50,130
Detective, you don't have
the slightest idea

759
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:52,132
what you're dealing with.

760
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:58,105
This has to be a nightmare
because what I saw in there is...

761
01:22:58,107 --> 01:23:00,074
It's not possible.

762
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:06,714
All right, what have we got?

763
01:23:06,716 --> 01:23:08,682
You're not going
to believe this.

764
01:23:08,684 --> 01:23:10,651
Try me.

765
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:16,023
Nice work, Rembrandt.

766
01:23:16,025 --> 01:23:18,993
How am I supposed to put out
an APB on a pumpkin?

767
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,296
- Detective?
- Yeah.

768
01:23:22,298 --> 01:23:24,398
Captain wants to see you
down at the station.

769
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,100
Shit.

770
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:32,139
Wait for me, Kevin.

771
01:23:32,141 --> 01:23:35,009
Hey, do not go knocking on
strangers' doors

772
01:23:35,011 --> 01:23:36,210
until I'm there.

773
01:23:36,212 --> 01:23:38,679
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, Mom!

774
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:24,525
Mom!

775
01:24:25,693 --> 01:24:26,827
Kevin?

776
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,100
Watch it, lady!

777
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:44,778
Kevin!

778
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:55,089
Hey!

779
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:04,798
McNally!

780
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,201
McNally, get the fuck in here!

781
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,310
Shut the door, shut the door.

782
01:25:16,312 --> 01:25:19,113
Sit in the fucking chair.

783
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,249
Rough day?

784
01:25:22,251 --> 01:25:25,385
I don't know.
What do you think?

785
01:25:25,387 --> 01:25:28,322
What's wrong with
this fucking picture?

786
01:25:28,324 --> 01:25:30,491
It's Halloween, sir.

787
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:33,193
Bullshit. Bullshit!

788
01:25:33,195 --> 01:25:38,398
Every year on Halloween,
this town goes batshit crazy.

789
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,235
I mean, check these reports out.

790
01:25:41,237 --> 01:25:43,504
We've got hysterical blindness,

791
01:25:43,506 --> 01:25:45,906
we got neighbors
attacking neighbors,

792
01:25:45,908 --> 01:25:48,675
kids looting
convenience stores.

793
01:25:48,677 --> 01:25:51,378
There's even a fucking report
of a UFO.

794
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:54,848
I mean, this is bullshit,
McNally.

795
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:57,251
You're just the man
to fix this.

796
01:25:57,253 --> 01:25:58,652
Ahh!

797
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:00,654
Just get your butt out there

798
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:03,323
and do the work
'cause if you don't,

799
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:05,659
I'm going to boot you
back to vice so fast,

800
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:07,327
your head's gonna spin.

801
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,296
Understood, Captain. I'm on it.

802
01:26:09,298 --> 01:26:13,534
Good, good! Go bag me
some of those horror freaks.

803
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:17,304
What the hell
happened to you guys?

804
01:26:17,306 --> 01:26:20,574
Some crazy kid ate
a shitload of chocolate.

805
01:26:20,576 --> 01:26:23,677
Yeah, and then he ate
his babysitter.

806
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,246
- Oh, the night.
- Oh, the mess.

807
01:26:26,248 --> 01:26:28,282
McNally, check this out.

808
01:26:28,284 --> 01:26:30,717
So I measure the bite marks
on the victim's body,

809
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:33,253
Whatever bit that guy's head off

810
01:26:33,255 --> 01:26:34,521
had a mouth about this wide.

811
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:36,223
Yeah. I can think
of a few suspects.

812
01:26:36,225 --> 01:26:38,225
Yeah, but then I ran the data
through the computer

813
01:26:38,227 --> 01:26:39,426
to make a 3D model

814
01:26:39,428 --> 01:26:42,262
and this is what
it came up with.

815
01:26:42,264 --> 01:26:43,864
Look familiar?

816
01:26:43,866 --> 01:26:46,433
Nice work, Bob. I owe you one.

817
01:26:46,435 --> 01:26:47,701
Buy me a drink later?

818
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,937
I'll think about it.
I gotta go.

819
01:26:55,276 --> 01:26:57,611
<i>Greetings, ghouls.</i>

820
01:26:57,613 --> 01:27:00,914
<i>Twelve bells means</i>
<i>the witching hour is upon us.</i>

821
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:05,319
<i>That's when the weird,</i>
<i>crazy, scary scale</i>

822
01:27:05,321 --> 01:27:07,521
<i>goes totally off the charts.</i>

823
01:27:07,523 --> 01:27:10,924
<i>So lock your doors</i>
<i>and hold onto your candy</i>

824
01:27:10,926 --> 01:27:15,596
<i>because Halloween</i>
<i>is about to get real.</i>

825
01:27:15,598 --> 01:27:17,497
<i>Dispatch to McNally.</i>

826
01:27:17,499 --> 01:27:20,467
<i>Got a 10-34 on Union and Baker.</i>
<i>Fire and medical are en route.</i>

827
01:27:20,469 --> 01:27:21,935
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what's going on down there,</i>

828
01:27:21,937 --> 01:27:23,670
<i>but it sounds like</i>
<i>a total clusterfuck.</i>

829
01:27:23,672 --> 01:27:26,506
<i>- Do you copy?</i>
- I'm on my way.

830
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:52,266
Holy shit!

831
01:28:19,994 --> 01:28:21,561
Shit.

832
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:08,942
McNally!

833
01:29:18,753 --> 01:29:19,953
Nice timing.

834
01:29:19,955 --> 01:29:21,835
I thought you might
need a hand.

835
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:26,960
Guess I owe you that drink now.

836
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:45,479
Let's go.

837
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:58,737
We have a warrant
to search your premises.

838
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:01,928
Look, I'm in the middle
of some important work here.

839
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:04,030
- You can't just barge...
- Yes, I can.

840
01:30:04,032 --> 01:30:07,100
I wouldn't argue with her.
She's not in the mood.

841
01:30:07,102 --> 01:30:09,770
I guess you should come in.

842
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:13,840
So, uh, Milo,

843
01:30:13,842 --> 01:30:16,877
show me where you grow
these super pumpkins.

844
01:30:16,879 --> 01:30:19,846
I can't just give away
company secrets

845
01:30:19,848 --> 01:30:22,916
to anybody who walks
through the...

846
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:25,585
door.

847
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:32,626
- I'll get some lights on.
- Quit stalling, Milo.

848
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:37,597
Oh, boy.

849
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:39,599
Holy shit.

850
01:30:41,202 --> 01:30:43,570
What's the big deal?

851
01:30:43,572 --> 01:30:45,605
Just a bunch of pumpkins.

852
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:02,155
<i>The witching hour is over.</i>

853
01:31:02,157 --> 01:31:03,957
<i>Thanks for listening.</i>

854
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:05,959
<i>And until next year,</i>

855
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:07,894
<i>Happy Halloween!</i>
