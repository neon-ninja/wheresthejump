the game is real.

695
00:35:18,006 --> 00:35:20,674
First, it was my turn,
I got asked in the library, and

696
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:22,542
it made me tell your secret;
then it was Ronnie's turn,

697
00:35:22,544 --> 00:35:23,944
he didn't do his dare,
and it killed him.

698

Maybe you and Ronnie
shouldn't have answered.

699
00:35:25,714 --> 00:35:28,082
Carter also said,
"Refuse to play and you die."

and I tried to ignore it.

"truth or dare" on my arm.
