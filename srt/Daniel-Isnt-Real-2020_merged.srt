00:01:57,178 --> 00:02:00,179
Okay, latte.

3
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:01,714
There you go.

4
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:06,485
Oh, your nails are so cute.
I love it.

5
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:17,898
- You want another?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

6
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

7
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,180
You need to calm down.

8
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:34,714
Do not tell me how to feel.

9
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:36,918
Do not tell me how to feel.

10
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,921
Did the fucking doctors...
Did the fucking doctors...

11
00:02:38,923 --> 00:02:41,590
No.
They don't need to.

12
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:43,925
Jesus Christ.

13
00:02:43,927 --> 00:02:46,195
What, are you going to break
every fucking dish in the house?

14
00:02:46,197 --> 00:02:47,696
Do you want me to pick them up
and pack them up

15
00:02:47,698 --> 00:02:48,897
for you when you go?

16
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:51,667
You know what?
You need help.

17
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:52,900
- I have had help.
- I am done with this shit.

18
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:54,736
- Help doesn't help.
- Okay?

19
00:02:54,738 --> 00:02:56,471
This medicine
doesn't make me me.

20
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:57,773
I'm not me anymore
when I take the medicine.

21
00:02:57,775 --> 00:02:59,607
I'm perfectly fine.
You are not a doctor.

22
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:00,843
You are not a doctor.

23
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:04,513
It will be okay, Wilbur.

24
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:06,916
Oh, you're going
to take my baby?

25
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:45,723
You want to go play?

26
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,890
Ill show you guys this way.

27
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,293
- Alright?
- We should go the other way.

28
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,061
I'm going to pull up
my laser sniper.

29
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,830
Okay.

30
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,932
Aah!
We're being shot at!

31
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,705
Luke?

32
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,908
Luke?

33
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:14,553
Luke, don't ever run away
like that ever again, okay?

34
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:17,056
- Come on.
- Wait.

35
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:18,690
Can Daniel come with us?

36
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,325
Daniel?
Who's Daniel?

37
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,029
Mom, he's my friend.

38
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,697
Okay.
Sure.

39
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,868
Daniel, would you come
to our house for dinner?

40
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,603
Yes, thanks.

41
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,811
You're the last hope to guard
the king's fortress.

42
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:39,912
- Aah!
- Aah!

43
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:43,115
But right now, I'm going
to skydive out of a helicopter,

44
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:46,052
and you will be
flying down videoing it.

45
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:47,086
Yep.

46
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:48,788
You have to fold that part in,

47
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,323
and then you have
to fold it in half.

48
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:52,124
Ah.
A-ha.

49
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,662
What's that?
It's an origami tea set.

50
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:57,097
Wow.
Did you make that?

51
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:59,098
I wanted you to have
a nice tea party

52
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,069
because you've been sad.

53
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:04,671
Oh.
Thank you.

54
00:05:04,673 --> 00:05:07,642
Three, two, one.

55
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:11,745
Say, "cheeseburger."

56
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:12,747
Click.

57
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:43,979
We're going to be just fine,
just you and me.

58
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:54,757
I have a really cool idea.

59
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,667
You have to press it down
while you turn it.

60
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:05,435
What are these?

61
00:06:05,437 --> 00:06:07,903
They'll give your mom
super powers.

62
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,834
Luke?

63
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:39,139
Luke?

64
00:06:56,956 --> 00:07:00,892
Luke?

65
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:04,197
Hey, baby.

66
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,765
Luke?

67
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:07,466
What did you do?

68
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,736
What did you do to me?

69
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:14,974
It wasn't me.
It was Daniel.

70
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,875
Daniel?

71
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:19,212
Baby, no more Daniel, honey.

72
00:07:19,214 --> 00:07:21,214
No more Daniel.

73
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:23,181
Okay?

74
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:34,294
Here, baby.

75
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:37,263
Take this key, and you can
lock up your,

76
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:43,169
um, imaginary friend
in Grandma's dollhouse.

77
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,741
I don't want to.

78
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:49,213
You... You have to.

79
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:53,848
You did something bad.
Now, get in.

80
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,315
Get in.
Get in!

81
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:57,918
Get in! Get in!

82
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,887
Get in!

83
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:01,822
Get in!

84
00:08:01,824 --> 00:08:04,558
Get in! Get in! Get in!

85
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,262
Get in! Get in!

86
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:31,083
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'll come by on the weekend.

87
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:32,251
When are you coming?

88
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:34,218
Yeah, like, uh,
today or tomorrow.

89
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,621
- I don't know.
- I mean, you can...

90
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:37,222
you can do that
if you want to do that,

91
00:09:37,224 --> 00:09:38,623
but just don't do that
because you think I need you

92
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,626
to do that
because I'm fine.

93
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:41,959
- I just...
- Mom...

94
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:43,127
No.
You don't have to do that.

95
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:44,963
Well, of course
I want to see you.

96
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:46,631
Don't just come home because
you don't like the school.

97
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:50,036
Maybe you just need to make
some friends or something.

98
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:51,637
Yo. Yo.
Check her out.

99
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,205
I'm not trying to be mean.
Do you think... I think...

100
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:55,041
Jesus, goddess
of the digital age.

101
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:56,376
I want to see you because I do.
I want to see you.

102
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:58,111
Of course,
I want to see you, but...

103
00:09:58,113 --> 00:10:00,647
Can't decide if I want
to bang her or worship her.

104
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:09,254
And so a successful
photograph is not only

105
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:11,357
about technical equipment...

106
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:13,661
the lens, the focus,
the lighting.

107
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:16,330
I expect you really have
something

108
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:21,034
The most important thing is
the relationship between you,

109
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:23,472
the photographer,
and your subject.

110
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:54,237
Mom?

111
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,154
Mom?

112
00:11:18,296 --> 00:11:20,096
Hi.

113
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:23,234
Beautiful boy.

114
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:32,376
Mm.

115
00:11:32,378 --> 00:11:34,210
I brought sandwiches.

116
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:50,527
It's ham and cheese.

117
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,030
Yeah.

118
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:55,366
It's your favorite.

119
00:11:55,368 --> 00:11:57,100
Thank you.

120
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:02,773
What are you working on, Mom?

121
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:08,112
Uh, it is, uh, sometimes,
it's the words.

122
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:10,448
Sometimes... I feel like
they speak to me.

123
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,383
There's messages in them,

124
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:17,156
in the books
and message in the...

125
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:20,392
Mom, what happened
to the mirror?

126
00:12:20,394 --> 00:12:22,161
Uh...

127
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,130
I didn't like what I saw.

128
00:13:47,385 --> 00:13:49,185
It's common
for people to see things

129
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:50,920
that aren't real.

130
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:53,288
Stress, alone, can do that.

131
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,891
I wouldn't worry.

132
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:59,528
Well, if I faint like
a Victorian duchess every time

133
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,229
I get stressed out by college,

134
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:03,431
it's going to be
a long 4 years, right?

135
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:06,569
That's why you're here.

136
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:13,409
Uh, my, uh, my mom, she
doesn't really trust doctors.

137
00:14:13,411 --> 00:14:16,381
Uh, she would not
want me to be here.

138
00:14:18,384 --> 00:14:20,316
She's not well.

139
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:25,321
Um, I think it's been worse
since I left home.

140
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:29,960
I worry about her a lot.

141
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:32,495
Fuck, I worry that
I could become like her.

142
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,531
I mean, this is supposed to be
the age where

143
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:36,201
you can start to...

144
00:14:36,203 --> 00:14:37,434
It can be.

145
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:39,236
What else do you worry about?

146
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:42,639
Um, sex and death, I guess.

147
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:45,643
The only topics
that should interest an adult.

148
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:46,711
Yeah?
Says who?

149
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,580
Lou Reed, but he also said,

150
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:51,352
"Life is like teaching Sanskrit
to a pony."

151
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:55,586
It's good.

152
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:59,194
Have you ever seen things
like this before?

153
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:06,397
Fuck.
Um, never, really.

154
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,499
No hallucinations?

155
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:09,504
No.

156
00:15:12,572 --> 00:15:19,444
Well...

157
00:15:20,982 --> 00:15:25,551
I had an imaginary friend
when I was a kid.

158
00:15:25,553 --> 00:15:31,790
Um, his name was Daniel,
and he was my best friend.

159
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:34,728
He was my only friend, really.

160
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:38,397
It's really pathetic.

161
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,000
We all have needs.

162
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:43,603
Well, I must have had
some pretty sick needs, man.

163
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:47,508
Did something happen
with this friend?

164
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,442
- No, no.
- Something painful?

165
00:15:49,444 --> 00:15:51,344
No.

166
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:56,587
No, no, just, you know,
kid stuff.

167
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:05,292
Well, then, it's kind
of a strange notion,

168
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:11,399
but maybe you shouldn't be
afraid of your imagination.

169
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,634
Maybe you should try to connect

170
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:15,472
with that part
of yourself again.

171
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:36,625
Ah, yo, what the fuck?

172
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:39,562
Uh, uh, I didn't see you.
Are you okay?

173
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:41,764
I'm practically bleeding
to death?

174
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:44,067
Really?
What?

175
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,534
Yes, I'm fine.

176
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:46,836
- Ugh.
- Phew.

177
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:49,404
Ugh.

178
00:16:49,406 --> 00:16:50,572
Yeah. I'm okay too.

179
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:52,475
Great.
Have a lovely day.

180
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:57,580
Okay, yeah.
Alright.

181
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:59,083
Not really,
but you know how it is.

182
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,551
You never miss the water
until the well runs dry.

183
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:05,855
Oh, big bad lummox like
you, hiring an aeroplane to ride.

184
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:08,691
You got to love yourself.

185
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:11,728
What?

186
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,897
I don't want to brag,
but I still got the general

187
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,733
and in the same place.

188
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,633
Look, Hilde, I only acted
like any husband

189
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:18,835
that didn't want to see
his home broken up.

190
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,571
- What home?
- What home?

191
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:43,795
Hey, Wilbur.

192
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:46,634
How's it going, buddy?

193
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:54,140
Can't sleep?

194
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

195
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:13,284
Mom?

196
00:20:13,286 --> 00:20:15,887
Somebody is going to be
looking for Lawrence.

197
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:16,955
Mom?

198
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:19,558
Hu-u-u-h?

199
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:26,032
Mom?

200
00:20:39,747 --> 00:20:41,013
Mom?

201
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:46,785
Mom, what's going on?

202
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,653
- I'm fine.
- Mom, it's not fine.

203
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:50,890
What's happening?

204
00:20:50,892 --> 00:20:52,757
- Let me in.
- Luke, no.

205
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:55,061
Stay away from the door, okay?
I'm coming in.

206
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:02,669
Jesus.
What did you do?

207
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:05,671
I can't...
I can't look at this face.

208
00:21:05,673 --> 00:21:08,374
I can't look...
I can't look at this face.

209
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:11,143
I... It keeps trying to...

210
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,947
Don't touch me!

211
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:14,981
Don't touch me.

212
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:24,758
Don't even look at me like that.

213
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,031
Like you're any different.

214
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:32,767
It'll be okay, Luke.

215
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:34,168
- I can't let you live like this.
- You what?

216
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,803
I can't let you stay here.

217
00:21:35,805 --> 00:21:38,038
- You can't let me stay here?
- Okay, Mom.

218
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,707
- You can't let me?
- I can't let you.

219
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:41,409
That's okay because
I'm leaving anyway.

220
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:42,977
No, no. No, no. No, no, no.
Mom, stop it.

221
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:43,944
- Let go.
- Stop it.

222
00:21:43,946 --> 00:21:44,978
- Let go.
- Stop it.

223
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,180
- Let go.
- Mom, stop!

224
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:47,849
Hold the blade to your throat.

225
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:50,885
Let go. Let go.

226
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:53,721
Put the blade
to your own throat.

227
00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:56,991
Let go, Luke.
Let go.

228
00:21:56,993 --> 00:21:58,661
No. No, don't.

229
00:21:58,663 --> 00:21:59,928
- Let go or kill me.
- No!

230
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,396
Let go, or you're
going to kill me.

231
00:22:01,398 --> 00:22:02,431
- No! What are you doing? Stop.
- Let go.

232
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:04,799
- Stop.
- Let go!

233
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:14,677
Oh, my beautiful boy.

234
00:22:20,018 --> 00:22:22,419
Okay. We can... We can
get you help, Mom.

235
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:24,887
It's okay

236
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:48,181
She's going to get through this.

237
00:22:50,183 --> 00:22:52,653
So are you.

238
00:22:55,053 --> 00:23:00,193
I didn't know that
you'd be there after so long.

239
00:23:02,262 --> 00:23:04,898
You needed my help.

240
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,206
Hey.

241
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:17,842
Oh.

242
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:24,820
Hi.

243
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,995
My blade swings sharp, sire.

244
00:23:36,997 --> 00:23:40,268
My blade is a broom, Daniel.

245
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:50,276
Symbolic logic strategies.

246
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:52,114
Why would you study this shit?

247
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:58,051
Because it's going to help
when I apply to law school.

248
00:23:58,053 --> 00:24:00,254
Law school?

249
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,122
Wasn't your father a lawyer?

250
00:24:03,124 --> 00:24:05,859
Last time I saw you,
you were this kid bursting

251
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,961
with imagination.

252
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:10,330
What happened?

253
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:13,066
You know what fucking happened,
Daniel.

254
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:22,976
Sorry it took me so long.

255
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:24,879
Oh, I did not even notice.

256
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:26,547
Who is this?

257
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,882
Are you always
such a space cadet?

258
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,851
Don't let a gorgeous girl
leave your apartment.

259
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:32,020
Okay.

260
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:35,024
Um, let me get you a reward.
Um...

261
00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:37,325
Satisfaction of a job well-done.

262
00:24:37,327 --> 00:24:42,131
I... Just give me a second.

263
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:46,302
I have some, um, uh, here.

264
00:24:54,344 --> 00:24:57,345
Here.

265
00:24:57,347 --> 00:24:58,849
It's cool, really.

266
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:01,051
Insist.

267
00:25:01,053 --> 00:25:03,987
I insist.
You came all the way from...

268
00:25:03,989 --> 00:25:07,189
I'll just buy some new paint
and think of you.

269
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:08,257
You're a painter?

270
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:11,361
You're an artist too, Luke.

271
00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:16,166
But I do photography sometimes.

272
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:18,067
Yeah.

273
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:21,403
Uh, um, my...
my mom had an accident.

274
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:23,210
Pfft, with a chain saw?

275
00:25:25,612 --> 00:25:27,111
That was mean.

276
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:30,113
- She going to be all right?
- I don't know.

277
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:31,649
I mean, she's in the hospital.

278
00:25:31,651 --> 00:25:35,119
No, that's good.
Be vulnerable.

279
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:39,323
She'll be okay.
I... I've just been cleaning up

280
00:25:39,325 --> 00:25:41,992
and trying to take my mind
off of it, you know?

281
00:25:41,994 --> 00:25:43,396
Mm.

282
00:25:46,098 --> 00:25:48,032
I'm going to this
opening tonight.

283
00:25:48,034 --> 00:25:49,668
I have a space in Green Point,

284
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,440
bunch of different artists
and photographers.

285
00:25:55,276 --> 00:25:57,045
Thanks.

286
00:26:04,018 --> 00:26:08,420
So you're a photographer
now, huh?

287
00:26:08,422 --> 00:26:11,324
Um, okay.

288
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:15,694
Uh, oh, yeah.

289
00:26:15,696 --> 00:26:17,262
I'm coming, right?

290
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:27,673
I don't think
this is a good idea.

291
00:26:27,675 --> 00:26:30,276
I usually get really overwhelmed
at these things.

292
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:32,679
That's because I haven't
been around, Luke.

293
00:26:35,717 --> 00:26:37,718
Stop.
You're really acting crazy.

294
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,086
You think I want to smash
this bottle

295
00:26:39,088 --> 00:26:40,954
across your smug-ass face.

296
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:42,255
We are not going to do this.
I knew it. I knew it. Come on.

297
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:44,023
Well, maybe you should've
came prepared then.

298
00:26:44,025 --> 00:26:46,159
Think you can diffuse this one?

299
00:26:46,161 --> 00:26:48,194
What? No.

300
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:49,696
Bitch!

301
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:51,065
- Trust me.
- Do you hear yourself?

302
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,332
You're, like, acting,
like, crazy.

303
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:53,500
- You got this.
- Like...

304
00:26:53,502 --> 00:26:55,034
You going to call me crazy
right now

305
00:26:55,036 --> 00:26:56,136
with a bottle in my hand?

306
00:26:56,138 --> 00:26:58,372
You're going to call me crazy?

307
00:26:58,374 --> 00:27:00,008
- What?
- Oh, my god.

308
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,077
Mm.
Sorry.

309
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,278
I just realized this place
is full

310
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,047
of fucking bullshit-ass posers.

311
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:10,050
Whatever, Cassie.

312
00:27:10,052 --> 00:27:12,354
So you're having a rough night?

313
00:27:12,356 --> 00:27:14,121
Yeah.
Sorry.

314
00:27:14,123 --> 00:27:16,057
Fuck.

315
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:18,195
This place literally sucks.

316
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:23,733
You coming?

317
00:27:23,735 --> 00:27:27,003
Yeah.
Yeah.

318
00:27:37,081 --> 00:27:42,784
All the real artists
are either dead or broke,

319
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:47,056
and you can't even make art
and live in the city anymore.

320
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:53,562
I feel like I'm looking
for a phantom approval

321
00:27:53,564 --> 00:27:57,566
from trust-funders and assholes.

322
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,369
You ever feel like you have
no idea who you really are?

323
00:28:02,106 --> 00:28:04,408
Look.

324
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,309
I mean, sometimes,
I can't even remember

325
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:12,182
why I started doing this shit
in the first place.

326
00:28:12,184 --> 00:28:16,387
I feel like, I don't know,
like I was born too late.

327
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:19,556
You did this one too?

328
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:23,428
It's an experiment,
one that clearly didn't work.

329
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,162
- It's the best thing here.
- What do you mean? Yeah.

330
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:27,497
It's... it's...
it's, uh, it's really good.

331
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:29,534
I like it a lot, actually.

332
00:28:29,536 --> 00:28:32,402
Well, if you think
it's interesting,

333
00:28:32,404 --> 00:28:33,537
who do you think that guy is?

334
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:36,275
- Her father.
- Uh, I don't know.

335
00:28:36,277 --> 00:28:38,013
My dad.

336
00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:43,114
Well, uh, that's good.

337
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:52,157
It's... it's melancholic,
you know, in a really good way.

338
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,624
Well, that's sweet of you
to say.

339
00:29:04,306 --> 00:29:06,573
Hey.
I have an idea.

340
00:29:06,575 --> 00:29:10,142
Since that one is so awesome,

341
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:12,845
I should probably trash
the rest of this then, huh?

342
00:29:12,847 --> 00:29:17,382
No.
Don't destroy... Oh, fuck.

343
00:29:17,384 --> 00:29:19,251
Get your camera out.

344
00:29:19,253 --> 00:29:20,652
You know what?

345
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:22,323
I think it's starting
to look like an improvement.

346
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:31,632
You want to try?

347
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,556
I've never made anything.
I'm not an artist.

348
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,625
She's, like, the coolest person
I've ever met.

349
00:29:57,627 --> 00:30:01,395
Luke, you're living
in a mental prison.

350
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:03,464
You need to break out and live.

351
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:05,166
I like you.

352
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:07,234
William Blake said his poetry
was a dictation

353
00:30:07,236 --> 00:30:08,569
from an archangel,

354
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:14,644
but really, he was
just gifted, just like you.

355
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,346
Is that why you're here, to give
me bleak little pep talks?

356
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,647
Is that it?

357
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:21,250
I'm here because you're here.

358
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,918
I'm part of you.

359
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,420
Okay.
So I'm fucking insane.

360
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:25,520
- That's fun.
- No.

361
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:29,291
Not insane, awake!

362
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:34,659
Hey, Richard.

363
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:38,397
Hey, Richard.

364
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,634
Richard!

365
00:31:41,636 --> 00:31:43,802
He could use a good scare.

366
00:31:43,804 --> 00:31:46,208
I'd say.

367
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:55,681
What the fuck?

368
00:31:55,683 --> 00:31:58,284
Oh, Jesus.

369
00:31:58,286 --> 00:32:01,353
Fuck, that is not cool, dude!

370
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:03,023
What is your fucking problem?

371
00:32:06,394 --> 00:32:08,294
That is not fucking cool, dude!

372
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:09,529
Whoa, oh!
What the fuck, dude?

373
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:11,399
This is...

374
00:32:29,384 --> 00:32:30,784
I bet you could get
a phone number

375
00:32:30,786 --> 00:32:35,056
from any girl
at this party.

376
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:37,659
Okay, man.

377
00:32:52,543 --> 00:32:56,378
She's smart, romantic.

378
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,083
Think silver screen,
"Pandora's Box."

379
00:33:00,085 --> 00:33:01,817
Hi.
This might sound weird,

380
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:06,823
but you have a real
Louise Brooks vibe.

381
00:33:06,825 --> 00:33:08,458
What?

382
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,461
Louise Brooks,
she's a silent film star.

383
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:13,829
She's in "Pandora's Box."

384
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:15,898
Yeah, the German classic
about a woman

385
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,402
whose raw sexuality
brings ruin to herself

386
00:33:19,404 --> 00:33:20,902
and everyone who loves her?

387
00:33:20,904 --> 00:33:22,472
- Yeah, that one.
- That one.

388
00:33:22,474 --> 00:33:24,575
- That's the one.
- Yeah.

389
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:27,911
So you're studying film?

390
00:33:27,913 --> 00:33:29,546
I watch films.

391
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:31,515
I study psychology.

392
00:33:31,517 --> 00:33:38,788
Okay, so then tell me
what I'm thinking.

393
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,691
That I look like Louise Brooks.

394
00:33:41,693 --> 00:33:43,594
You've got it.
You nailed it.

395
00:33:43,596 --> 00:33:45,796
You must be at the top
of your class.

396
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:47,731
Do you mind if I just...

397
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:48,866
Oh.

398
00:33:48,868 --> 00:33:50,769
This is better.

399
00:33:58,177 --> 00:34:02,814
Here.

400
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:04,749
That's my number.

401
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,484
Text me that picture.

402
00:34:07,486 --> 00:34:08,719
Okay.

403
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:12,424
- I'm Luke.
- Sophie.

404
00:34:13,894 --> 00:34:16,461
- Sophie.
- Sophie.

405
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:22,635
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug,

406
00:34:22,637 --> 00:34:24,769
chug,
chug, chug, chug, chug.

407
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,205
That's not good.

408
00:34:26,207 --> 00:34:27,906
I don't like doing it
that much at a time.

409
00:34:27,908 --> 00:34:29,642
No. Fuck it. Let's go for it.
Here we go.

410
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,514
Two shots for you,
and then two shots for me.

411
00:34:34,516 --> 00:34:36,782
Oh.
You know I can't touch those.

412
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:37,884
Four shots for you.

413
00:34:37,886 --> 00:34:41,587
For Sophie!

414
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:42,621
College!

415
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,690
Hey, Sophie.

416
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:36,578
I fucked up.
Oh, I fucked up.

417
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,580
No.

418
00:35:38,582 --> 00:35:40,717
No, no, no, no, no.

419
00:35:42,953 --> 00:35:44,989
Hey.
You did great.

420
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:52,028
Luke?

421
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:55,626
Drop it or kill me, Mommy.

422
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:28,998
Hey.
How does the water feel?

423
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:33,934
I don't know.

424
00:37:48,385 --> 00:37:51,084
You're making
some pretty good stuff.

425
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:52,754
Yeah.

426
00:37:52,756 --> 00:37:55,990
I'm, uh, just trying to connect
with people,

427
00:37:55,992 --> 00:37:59,727
you know, empathy, I guess.

428
00:37:59,729 --> 00:38:02,129
Uh...

429
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:04,732
Whatever you say.

430
00:38:17,882 --> 00:38:19,847
What are we doing?

431
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:21,752
Trespassing.

432
00:38:28,826 --> 00:38:31,226
These motherfuckers really need
to change their locks.

433
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:35,030
I worked here for, like,
3 weeks a year ago.

434
00:38:35,032 --> 00:38:37,700
Ooh!

435
00:38:37,702 --> 00:38:40,803
"Where the Wild Things Are,"

436
00:38:40,805 --> 00:38:41,941
I've always wanted
to be a wild thing.

437
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,475
You like that book?

438
00:38:45,477 --> 00:38:46,975
"The night Max wore
his wolf suit

439
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:48,178
and made mischief
of one kind or another"...

440
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,080
"The night Max wore
his wolf suit

441
00:38:50,082 --> 00:38:53,716
and made mischief
of one kind or another"...

442
00:38:53,718 --> 00:38:54,917
..."his mother called him
a wild thing."

443
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:56,655
..."his mother called him
a wild thing."

444
00:38:59,225 --> 00:39:01,792
I've always wanted to do this
because they're so adamant

445
00:39:01,794 --> 00:39:02,893
about you not hopping seats.

446
00:39:02,895 --> 00:39:04,094
Whoa!
Now spin.

447
00:39:04,096 --> 00:39:07,898
I'm hopping them all.

448
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:13,804
"The Ways of Seeing,"
this one totally blew me away

449
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:15,473
when I first decided
to become an artist.

450
00:39:15,475 --> 00:39:16,973
Ah, "Ways of Seeing," me, too.

451
00:39:16,975 --> 00:39:18,909
That's actually one
of my favorite books.

452
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:21,812
- I believe it's...
- "To be naked is to be oneself."

453
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:23,914
"To be naked is to be oneself."

454
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:27,251
"To be nude is
to be seen naked by others

455
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:30,791
and yet not recognized
for oneself."

456
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:36,128
Okay, super brain.

457
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,829
Ah!

458
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:39,164
Ah!

459
00:39:44,238 --> 00:39:45,269
Oh, yeah, the Bible?
That's easy.

460
00:39:45,271 --> 00:39:46,839
- Come on.
- My favorite.

461
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:47,973
I know it like
the back of my hand.

462
00:39:47,975 --> 00:39:50,076
- Exodus 20.
- Exodus 20.

463
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:53,179
"And God spoke all these words."

464
00:39:53,181 --> 00:39:56,315
"I am the Lord your God
who brought you out of Egypt

465
00:39:56,317 --> 00:39:58,183
out of the land of slavery."

466
00:39:58,185 --> 00:39:59,986
"There once was a man
from Nantucket

467
00:39:59,988 --> 00:40:01,853
whose cock was so long,
he could suck it."

468
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:03,121
"And you shall not
bow down to them

469
00:40:03,123 --> 00:40:04,891
or worship them,
for I am your God."

470
00:40:04,893 --> 00:40:06,158
"He said with a grin,
as he wiped off his chin..."

471
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,999
"And you shall have
no other God before me"!

472
00:40:12,568 --> 00:40:14,901
Amen.

473
00:40:14,903 --> 00:40:17,137
- Great.
- Yeah.

474
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:19,275
That's not
a very well-known verse.

475
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,144
Hmm.

476
00:40:24,146 --> 00:40:26,883
Let's go get some fresh air.

477
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:31,151
You are so funny.

478
00:40:31,153 --> 00:40:33,220
- Why?
- I don't know.

479
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,024
It seems like you always have
some type of private joke

480
00:40:36,026 --> 00:40:40,928
or something going on
in your head, all by yourself.

481
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,297
Oh, hey.
I, um...

482
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:45,834
I have something
I've been working on.

483
00:40:45,836 --> 00:40:47,301
I'd love to show you.

484
00:40:52,942 --> 00:40:55,109
I'm taking a lot of photos.

485
00:41:03,186 --> 00:41:06,054
I like that one.

486
00:41:14,898 --> 00:41:17,168
Damn.

487
00:41:19,003 --> 00:41:21,036
These are hot.

488
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:29,946
You know you're my inspiration
for this entire project, right?

489
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:32,348
Really?

490
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:35,118
I figure you deserve
to be immortalized.

491
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,220
We... <i>We</i> deserve
to be immortalized.

492
00:41:38,222 --> 00:41:41,426
Oh, yeah? You think that
<i>I</i> deserve to be immortalized?

493
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:46,130
Shirt off, please.

494
00:42:36,384 --> 00:42:39,319
What's that thing, uh,
behind me?

495
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:41,320
What's that supposed to be?

496
00:42:41,322 --> 00:42:47,196
It's, like, your shadow,
your hidden self.

497
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:55,904
It's, like, I saw something
full of danger, mystery.

498
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:04,914
Okay. Um, and you can see it,
like, visually, or...

499
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:14,457
Maybe I'm the crazy one.

500
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:21,933
Well, crazy isn't always
a bad thing.

501
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:06,242
This okay?

502
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:08,113
Yeah.

503
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:44,385
Okay.

504
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:46,680
Help me!

505
00:45:46,682 --> 00:45:50,383
Help me!

506
00:45:50,385 --> 00:45:52,285
Help me!

507
00:45:55,892 --> 00:45:58,158
Right on time.

508
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,426
What?

509
00:45:59,428 --> 00:46:00,894
Did you order a pizza?

510
00:46:00,896 --> 00:46:03,564
No.

511
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:05,332
I brought a friend.

512
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:10,508
- Hi.
- Hello.

513
00:46:12,942 --> 00:46:14,543
Welcome, ladies.

514
00:46:14,545 --> 00:46:16,378
You know, if we threw
your roommate off a bridge,

515
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,179
we could have these girls
to ourselves.

516
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:20,681
Mikayla, meet the fabulously
talented Luke Nightingale.

517
00:46:20,683 --> 00:46:23,552
Mm, he's a total perv.
Can we do something fun?

518
00:46:23,554 --> 00:46:25,353
I swear to god,
if I drink one more...

519
00:46:25,355 --> 00:46:27,255
- We've been texting.
- ...flat beer, I... I will die.

520
00:46:27,257 --> 00:46:31,525
Hmm. Oh.

521
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:34,329
These are your friends now.

522
00:46:34,331 --> 00:46:37,934
- Right, guys?
- These are what friends do.

523
00:46:37,936 --> 00:46:42,939
Fucking groovy, very erotic.

524
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:45,274
- Hmm.
- Hurry, bitch.

525
00:46:45,276 --> 00:46:47,276
- Yeah.
- Apocalypse sex, right, guys?

526
00:46:47,278 --> 00:46:48,678
We've got to get it in
while we can.

527
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,979
We're all going to be wiped out
by a nuclear war,

528
00:46:50,981 --> 00:46:52,647
a super flu
or a fucking tsunami.

529
00:46:52,649 --> 00:46:55,283
I'm so fucking tired
of this little Muppet.

530
00:46:55,285 --> 00:46:56,686
We're ever going to fuck
as much as the boomers,

531
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,455
we got to pack it in now.

532
00:46:58,457 --> 00:47:02,259
Honestly, I'd rather die
of the super flu than fuck you.

533
00:47:02,261 --> 00:47:03,759
Well, Mikayla doesn't.

534
00:47:03,761 --> 00:47:06,563
You know, he kind of reminds me
of these guys.

535
00:47:13,439 --> 00:47:14,770
I thought it was funny.

536
00:47:14,772 --> 00:47:17,442
You guys, I got a great idea.

537
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:29,423
Steam tunnels, miles and miles
underneath campus.

538
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,594
Yeah!

539
00:48:01,656 --> 00:48:04,323
Hey. Check this out.

540
00:48:10,498 --> 00:48:13,333
This place got five stars
on Yelp.

541
00:48:13,335 --> 00:48:17,771
Yeah, well, do you think we're
going to be able to get a table?

542
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:22,041
The, uh,
Jacuzzi is down this way.

543
00:48:22,043 --> 00:48:24,476
Ugh.

544
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:37,394
Do you ever feel like
you're hiding your true self?

545
00:48:39,495 --> 00:48:41,529
What?

546
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:43,430
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

547
00:48:43,432 --> 00:48:45,466
Like, you have to make
a whole new identity

548
00:48:45,468 --> 00:48:48,272
just to conceal
who you really are.

549
00:48:49,805 --> 00:48:51,439
Yeah, I guess.

550
00:48:51,441 --> 00:48:54,075
I... I mean, I...
I feel like I have this...

551
00:48:54,077 --> 00:48:55,176
Just kiss her, Luke.

552
00:48:55,178 --> 00:48:56,810
...this voice in my head
that tells me what to do,

553
00:48:56,812 --> 00:48:58,679
but I don't always do it,
you know?

554
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:00,382
- I... I don't always...
- I feel like there is something

555
00:49:00,384 --> 00:49:03,351
intense inside you,
like an animal.

556
00:49:03,353 --> 00:49:05,420
Oh, I like her.

557
00:49:05,422 --> 00:49:06,722
What do you mean?

558
00:49:06,724 --> 00:49:09,690
Why would you say that...
animal?

559
00:49:09,692 --> 00:49:12,626
What are you doing?

560
00:49:12,628 --> 00:49:14,528
Is this is about Cassie?

561
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,565
You're not married, man.
Just kiss her.

562
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:17,766
Hey.

563
00:49:17,768 --> 00:49:19,735
You there?

564
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:22,138
Yeah.
Sorry.

565
00:49:29,113 --> 00:49:30,812
- I'm sorry.
- You okay?

566
00:49:30,814 --> 00:49:33,682
Um, Yeah.

567
00:49:33,684 --> 00:49:35,917
I'm just... I'm...
I'm a lightweight.

568
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:39,555
Just...
Can you just give me a second?

569
00:49:47,933 --> 00:49:51,601
Hey.

570
00:49:51,603 --> 00:49:55,605
If you're not going to do this,
let me take over.

571
00:49:55,607 --> 00:49:58,141
It's not cheating if it's me.

572
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:39,717
Oh, wow. Okay.
We're doing this.

573
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,960
Smile for the camera.

574
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,594
Smile yourself.

575
00:50:50,765 --> 00:50:54,232
Come here.

576
00:50:54,234 --> 00:50:59,773
You're in my body.

577
00:50:59,775 --> 00:51:02,545
Stop it.

578
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,553
Stop it!

579
00:51:16,825 --> 00:51:19,629
Stop it!

580
00:51:27,002 --> 00:51:29,804
No. Stop it!
I want my body back!

581
00:51:33,676 --> 00:51:34,908
Ow!

582
00:51:40,049 --> 00:51:45,921
Please, I want it back.

583
00:51:45,923 --> 00:51:48,990
Give me my body back.

584
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:51,626
You look good in that picture.

585
00:51:51,628 --> 00:51:53,729
I want my body back.

586
00:51:53,731 --> 00:51:56,298
Please, I want my body back.

587
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,867
I want my body back!

588
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:01,003
Aah!

589
00:52:01,005 --> 00:52:03,604
Hey.
We, uh... We done here?

590
00:52:03,606 --> 00:52:07,275
- Ugh, this fucking guy.
- It's hot as fuck.

591
00:52:07,277 --> 00:52:10,547
Whoa. Hey.
Fuck you, man.

592
00:52:10,549 --> 00:52:12,781
You dumb fuck.

593
00:52:14,953 --> 00:52:16,886
Luke!
Stop it, Luke!

594
00:52:25,663 --> 00:52:28,665
What the fuck is wrong with you?

595
00:52:33,806 --> 00:52:35,773
Right.

596
00:52:35,775 --> 00:52:40,644
Okay.

597
00:52:40,646 --> 00:52:42,646
Okay.

598
00:52:42,648 --> 00:52:45,552
They're going to kick me out of
fucking school because of you.

599
00:52:46,953 --> 00:52:50,857
Then I've set you free,
just like I promised.

600
00:52:55,594 --> 00:52:57,328
Okay, I'm going to...
I'm going to count to three.

601
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:58,897
I'm going to close my eyes.

602
00:52:58,899 --> 00:53:00,799
I'm going to count to three,
and when I finish,

603
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:03,100
you're going to be gone.

604
00:53:03,102 --> 00:53:04,336
Alright?

605
00:53:04,338 --> 00:53:06,540
Okay.

606
00:53:10,876 --> 00:53:13,377
One...

607
00:53:15,682 --> 00:53:18,984
...two...

608
00:53:21,688 --> 00:53:23,625
...three.

609
00:53:27,728 --> 00:53:30,096
I imagined you.
I can make you go away.

610
00:53:30,098 --> 00:53:32,898
Well, then you might as well
cut your own head off.

611
00:53:47,383 --> 00:53:51,118
Okay.
Get in.

612
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,988
Get in.

613
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:56,656
Get in!

614
00:53:56,658 --> 00:53:59,792
You can't put me
back in the box.

615
00:53:59,794 --> 00:54:01,761
- Get in!
- You're too crazy!

616
00:54:01,763 --> 00:54:05,999
Can't keep a lid
on your delusions.

617
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:08,868
Fucking asshole.

618
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:12,840
This place hasn't changed much.

619
00:54:12,842 --> 00:54:15,909
They even put me
in the same room.

620
00:54:15,911 --> 00:54:19,080
Do you think you can
come home soon?

621
00:54:19,082 --> 00:54:21,415
I don't know.

622
00:54:21,417 --> 00:54:24,721
This time it isn't up to me.

623
00:54:28,091 --> 00:54:30,757
When did this all start for you?

624
00:54:30,759 --> 00:54:35,030
Uh, when did I start
to lose my fucking mind?

625
00:54:35,032 --> 00:54:36,767
You know what I mean.

626
00:54:38,802 --> 00:54:43,137
20.

627
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:47,943
I tried to burn down
the college radio station

628
00:54:47,945 --> 00:54:50,912
because I thought
the deejays were taunting me.

629
00:54:55,985 --> 00:54:57,821
They sent me home for a semester

630
00:54:57,823 --> 00:55:00,725
as though that was
a better place for me.

631
00:55:01,993 --> 00:55:05,995
What'd that feel like?

632
00:55:05,997 --> 00:55:10,199
Uh, like being jacked
into an electrical socket.

633
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:14,237
It was awful and wonderful
at the same time, and...

634
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:20,243
and then suddenly
it was only awful.

635
00:55:20,245 --> 00:55:22,079
That's because you weren't
doing it right.

636
00:55:33,525 --> 00:55:36,526
You don't have to hide anything,
you know?

637
00:55:36,528 --> 00:55:39,497
No.
You can... You can talk to me.

638
00:55:39,499 --> 00:55:43,233
Did you know this would
happen to me, too?

639
00:55:43,235 --> 00:55:45,270
- No. No.
- Why wouldn't you tell me?

640
00:55:45,272 --> 00:55:47,839
No.
I didn't... I didn't know.

641
00:55:47,841 --> 00:55:50,040
I... I... I... I... I didn't...

642
00:55:50,042 --> 00:55:53,078
I always hoped that whatever
was happening back then,

643
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,312
whatever happened that you were
doing because you were angry,

644
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:58,049
it was... it was a reaction
to your father leaving.

645
00:55:58,051 --> 00:55:59,283
- What is happening?
- I'm fine.

646
00:55:59,285 --> 00:56:00,518
- What is happening right now?
- Luke.

647
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,254
- Luke.
- Honey, what is it?

648
00:56:02,256 --> 00:56:03,955
- Time to say goodbye to Mommy.
- I can see something's wrong.

649
00:56:03,957 --> 00:56:05,056
- I don't know what's wrong.
- Luke!

650
00:56:05,058 --> 00:56:06,290
- No. I want to help you.
- Luke!

651
00:56:06,292 --> 00:56:07,993
I need to help you.
He needs help.

652
00:56:07,995 --> 00:56:09,961
- My son, he needs help.
- No. I'm fine. I'm fine.

653
00:56:09,963 --> 00:56:11,530
Okay. He needs help.
He needs help.

654
00:56:11,532 --> 00:56:13,132
What? What?
No, Luke!

655
00:56:13,134 --> 00:56:14,833
No!
You need help!

656
00:56:14,835 --> 00:56:16,001
I wish we killed you
when we had the chance!

657
00:56:16,003 --> 00:56:17,135
I can feel it!
There's something wrong!

658
00:56:17,137 --> 00:56:18,804
You're not safe!

659
00:56:18,806 --> 00:56:19,972
Something's wrong!

660
00:56:19,974 --> 00:56:22,175
Let me go!
Let me go!

661
00:56:22,177 --> 00:56:24,010
Luke! Luke!

662
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:38,859
I can't keep this.

663
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:40,560
I can't keep going like this.
I don't...

664
00:56:40,562 --> 00:56:42,129
If this keeps going this way,
I don't know what I might do.

665
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:43,964
Hey, Sophie.

666
00:56:43,966 --> 00:56:45,899
I'm scared.
I'm scared of what I could do.

667
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:47,366
- Don't come any closer.
- Sophie, I...

668
00:56:47,368 --> 00:56:49,368
You're not even supposed to be
on this fucking campus!

669
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:50,971
All this fuss about what?

670
00:56:50,973 --> 00:56:52,238
I only came here to apologize.

671
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,174
You want to see what
I really want to do her?

672
00:56:54,176 --> 00:56:55,308
I don't want to hear it.

673
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:01,181
You're out of
your fucking mind.

674
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,983
Fuck!

675
00:57:02,985 --> 00:57:05,052
No, wait.
No. Look. Sophie.

676
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:07,989
- Look. It wasn't me.
- I told you not to touch me!

677
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:12,226
I'm warning everyone about you,
you fucking monster!

678
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:14,329
Aah!

679
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:15,996
Help me, doc.

680
00:57:15,998 --> 00:57:18,065
I'm... I'm just so confused!

681
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,266
Shut the fuck up!

682
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:20,601
This doesn't sound like you.

683
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,338
No, because
it's fucking not me!

684
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:25,908
Right? It's... it's...
Or maybe it is me.

685
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:27,343
You're not a child, Luke.

686
00:57:27,345 --> 00:57:31,080
You have to take responsibility
for what you've done.

687
00:57:31,082 --> 00:57:34,283
Daniel is simply
an aspect of your mind.

688
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:35,984
It's not fucking me.

689
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:38,620
I... when I fall asleep,
I think he's...

690
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:41,957
he's... he's taking
over my body, you know?

691
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,026
He's making me do things
that I...

692
00:57:44,028 --> 00:57:46,195
I... I don't want to do.

693
00:57:46,197 --> 00:57:47,964
I need this to stop.

694
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:49,065
Talk to me.

695
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:51,967
Luke, you hurt someone.

696
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,939
What have you done?

697
00:57:59,176 --> 00:58:04,246
I tried to kill my mother...

698
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:06,852
when I was a kid.

699
00:58:08,386 --> 00:58:10,354
Because of Daniel?

700
00:58:15,028 --> 00:58:16,693
God, I'm just like her.

701
00:58:16,695 --> 00:58:21,999
No.
No, Luke, you're not.

702
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:25,068
You're something
so much more interesting.

703
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:34,281
Can you help me?

704
00:58:37,016 --> 00:58:38,449
I just want him to be gone.

705
00:58:38,451 --> 00:58:41,252
What the fuck?

706
00:58:41,254 --> 00:58:43,188
Medication may help you...

707
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,422
You do this?

708
00:58:44,424 --> 00:58:46,958
...which is a fact
of brain chemistry,

709
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,393
not a judgement
of character.

710
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:03,443
Leave me alone!

711
00:59:03,445 --> 00:59:04,744
What?

712
00:59:11,186 --> 00:59:13,251
I just want him to be gone.

713
00:59:20,161 --> 00:59:23,464
Don't do it, Luke.

714
00:59:23,466 --> 00:59:26,232
It's going to
cripple your brain.

715
00:59:26,234 --> 00:59:31,073
You can say goodbye to all
that photography and the women.

716
00:59:36,212 --> 00:59:39,279
Don't do it.

717
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

718
01:00:21,526 --> 01:00:24,060
Aah!

719
01:00:24,062 --> 01:00:27,062
Aah! Argh!

720
01:00:27,064 --> 01:00:28,564
Gragh!

721
01:00:28,566 --> 01:00:29,598
What the fuck?

722
01:00:31,468 --> 01:00:34,237
Oh, you should've seen
the look on your face.

723
01:00:50,422 --> 01:00:52,521
Get in! Get in!

724
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:55,324
Get in!

725
01:00:55,326 --> 01:00:59,162
Get in! Get in!
Get in!

726
01:01:45,312 --> 01:01:49,485
It was quite a spectacle,
wasn't it?

727
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:56,421
All that blood.

728
01:02:06,901 --> 01:02:09,536
Who is it?

729
01:02:09,538 --> 01:02:14,111
Are you Percy Thigpen,
John's father?

730
01:02:18,181 --> 01:02:20,380
How did you get this address?

731
01:02:20,382 --> 01:02:22,583
I need your help, please.

732
01:02:22,585 --> 01:02:24,518
It's the middle
of the God damn night.

733
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,319
Please, please.

734
01:02:26,321 --> 01:02:29,690
How the hell am I supposed
to help you?

735
01:02:29,692 --> 01:02:31,391
Look, I'm sorry to bother you.

736
01:02:31,393 --> 01:02:36,463
I... I was there when your son,
you know...

737
01:02:41,304 --> 01:02:43,939
You saw it?

738
01:02:43,941 --> 01:02:45,506
Yeah.

739
01:02:45,508 --> 01:02:52,948
Uh, after the police had come,
but I saw it.

740
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:57,189
Hard to go on
after a thing like that.

741
01:03:00,491 --> 01:03:05,694
Yeah, I... I just...

742
01:03:05,696 --> 01:03:09,665
I think that John
and I might be similar.

743
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:13,969
- Similar? How?
- Okay.

744
01:03:13,971 --> 01:03:15,737
How did you find out that there
was something wrong with him?

745
01:03:15,739 --> 01:03:19,475
Like, when did you...
when did you learn?

746
01:03:19,477 --> 01:03:23,380
We tried to help him,
uh, medicate him.

747
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:29,318
He'd, uh, he'd get better for
a while, but it wouldn't last.

748
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,389
Drawing seemed to calm him.

749
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:33,990
It's the one thing
that made him happy.

750
01:03:33,992 --> 01:03:35,425
Drawing?

751
01:03:35,427 --> 01:03:37,461
Did... do you have
any of his drawings?

752
01:03:37,463 --> 01:03:38,695
Can I... Can I look
at his drawings?

753
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:44,569
There's one on the fridge.

754
01:04:06,459 --> 01:04:08,693
Did John ever have a friend,
like, uh, a friend

755
01:04:08,695 --> 01:04:10,496
that only he could see?

756
01:04:10,498 --> 01:04:13,431
Well, you mean, uh,
an imaginary friend?

757
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,367
When he was a kid, I guess.

758
01:04:15,369 --> 01:04:16,601
Okay. Well, how about
when he was older?

759
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:19,405
Did he ever hear voices
or anything?

760
01:04:24,045 --> 01:04:25,510
Why don't you sit down?

761
01:04:25,512 --> 01:04:28,380
Let me get you a glass of water.

762
01:04:28,382 --> 01:04:31,516
Look, I need you
to tell me everything, okay?

763
01:04:31,518 --> 01:04:33,620
I need to stop this
from happening to me.

764
01:04:33,622 --> 01:04:35,825
Please, just sit down, okay?

765
01:04:38,626 --> 01:04:40,627
I can show you
more of his drawings.

766
01:04:40,629 --> 01:04:42,796
- You want me to do that?
- Yeah, I do.

767
01:04:53,475 --> 01:04:55,674
Here they are.

768
01:05:07,556 --> 01:05:10,657
Can you tell me your name?

769
01:05:10,659 --> 01:05:12,628
Luke.

770
01:05:16,431 --> 01:05:20,468
Luke, what are you afraid
you might do?

771
01:05:49,701 --> 01:05:53,502
You know, he's got
the cops on the phone.

772
01:05:57,842 --> 01:05:59,909
Show me your hands.

773
01:05:59,911 --> 01:06:01,610
Your other hand, show me.

774
01:06:01,612 --> 01:06:04,647
It's okay.
It's okay.

775
01:06:04,649 --> 01:06:07,482
We can get you
whatever help you need.

776
01:06:07,484 --> 01:06:08,751
All right?
Whatever you need.

777
01:06:08,753 --> 01:06:10,486
Wait, wait a minute.

778
01:06:10,488 --> 01:06:11,789
Hold on.

779
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:13,524
- Calm down, son!
- This is... this is Daniel.

780
01:06:13,526 --> 01:06:15,158
♪ La, la, la
La, la, la ♪

781
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,160
This is Daniel, and he was
with John until he was dead.

782
01:06:17,162 --> 01:06:18,961
- We can help you.
- And now he's with me, okay?

783
01:06:18,963 --> 01:06:20,597
- Okay?
- We can help you.

784
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:22,865
- Wait.
- ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la ♪

785
01:06:30,476 --> 01:06:33,611
Hey.
I missed you.

786
01:06:33,613 --> 01:06:34,779
Are you okay?

787
01:06:34,781 --> 01:06:36,181
I have... I have to sit down.

788
01:06:38,785 --> 01:06:41,652
- That's who you saw.
- What?

789
01:06:41,654 --> 01:06:43,187
That's who you saw
when you painted me, right?

790
01:06:43,189 --> 01:06:44,688
What are you talking about?
That's just a drawing.

791
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:47,828
No.
This is a drawing of...

792
01:06:50,997 --> 01:06:54,199
12 years ago, the kid
who drew this, this kid,

793
01:06:54,201 --> 01:06:57,970
John Thigpen, he killed
a bunch of people, Cassie.

794
01:06:57,972 --> 01:06:59,704
The same fucking thing
that happened to him

795
01:06:59,706 --> 01:07:00,872
is happening to me.

796
01:07:00,874 --> 01:07:03,209
- Wait.
- And I... I'm scared that

797
01:07:03,211 --> 01:07:05,610
I could do the same thing.

798
01:07:05,612 --> 01:07:06,811
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

799
01:07:06,813 --> 01:07:08,780
No.
You... Okay.

800
01:07:08,782 --> 01:07:10,583
You think you're going to kill
someone because of a drawing?

801
01:07:10,585 --> 01:07:11,851
Uh, okay.

802
01:07:11,853 --> 01:07:14,552
When you painted me,
you saw a shadow, right?

803
01:07:14,554 --> 01:07:16,822
What did he look like?

804
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:18,691
There's no he.

805
01:07:18,693 --> 01:07:20,893
The shadow was a metaphor for
what I saw hiding inside of you.

806
01:07:20,895 --> 01:07:22,828
No.
His name is... is Daniel.

807
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,564
- Love me!
- What? Please stop.

808
01:07:25,566 --> 01:07:28,234
Whatever you're doing,
this freak-out, please stop.

809
01:07:28,236 --> 01:07:29,969
Just talk to me.

810
01:07:29,971 --> 01:07:33,739
Oh, the things that I'm going to
do to her when you let go.

811
01:07:33,741 --> 01:07:35,574
- Luke.
- You saw him, Cassie!

812
01:07:35,576 --> 01:07:36,676
You saw him.

813
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:37,977
Look.
You fucking saw him!

814
01:07:37,979 --> 01:07:39,745
Look there, there, there.

815
01:07:39,747 --> 01:07:41,013
It's right here.
That's him.

816
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,549
Luke, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, no.

817
01:07:42,551 --> 01:07:44,251
You saw him.
He's right fucking here.

818
01:07:44,253 --> 01:07:46,052
I saw your darkness,
and that's okay.

819
01:07:46,054 --> 01:07:47,554
It's something
we all have inside...

820
01:07:47,556 --> 01:07:49,956
Not again.

821
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:51,691
Not like this, Cassie.

822
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:52,994
- Get out.
- He's right there.

823
01:07:52,996 --> 01:07:54,762
- Get out!
- You painted him when you saw him.

824
01:07:54,764 --> 01:07:56,864
Go, go!
No. No.

825
01:07:56,866 --> 01:07:59,300
- He's going to kill you.
- Get out!

826
01:07:59,302 --> 01:08:01,738
He's going to fucking
kill you, Cassie.

827
01:08:06,074 --> 01:08:08,810
I don't know what
he's going to do.

828
01:08:08,812 --> 01:08:11,712
I can't go to sleep like this.

829
01:08:11,714 --> 01:08:13,517
He'll take over.

830
01:08:15,885 --> 01:08:16,985
I need your help, please.

831
01:08:16,987 --> 01:08:20,955
Please.

832
01:08:20,957 --> 01:08:24,058
Why don't I come
down to your mother's apartment?

833
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:27,896
You're going to regret this,
Luke.

834
01:09:17,149 --> 01:09:20,818
Those pills don't work.

835
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:23,121
To be honest, I try not
to depend entirely on

836
01:09:23,123 --> 01:09:25,357
Western medicine.

837
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,861
There are other approaches.

838
01:09:31,999 --> 01:09:36,603
The mind reflects
its environment.

839
01:09:40,139 --> 01:09:42,709
This was your world
when it all started.

840
01:09:45,045 --> 01:09:47,915
I want to know
what Daniel has to say.

841
01:09:49,884 --> 01:09:52,385
What, so you think he's real?

842
01:09:52,387 --> 01:09:57,025
He's a real part of your mind,
but he doesn't have to be.

843
01:09:59,794 --> 01:10:04,599
I'm going to induce a state
of hypnosis in both of us.

844
01:10:15,943 --> 01:10:20,914
The Tibetan singing bowl is said
to bring clarity to the mind.

845
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:24,950
The dagger is strong enough
to pierce illusions,

846
01:10:24,952 --> 01:10:27,887
to destroy our demons
or as we call them

847
01:10:27,889 --> 01:10:31,725
these days, our trauma.

848
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:34,163
Do you think
this is going to work?

849
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:41,235
We need to engage with
the delusion on its own terms.

850
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,470
Is Daniel here now?

851
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:44,972
Of course.

852
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,775
He's always here.

853
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:49,043
What's he saying?

854
01:10:49,045 --> 01:10:50,711
He says, "Fuck off."

855
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:54,448
He says...

856
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:57,452
He's saying
some really nasty stuff.

857
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:04,926
Lie down.

858
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:15,739
Close your eyes
and go inside the sound.

859
01:11:27,852 --> 01:11:34,890
Fear and loneliness are some
of the most powerful emotions

860
01:11:34,892 --> 01:11:36,825
humans can experience.

861
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:43,099
These feelings can grow
inside us

862
01:11:43,101 --> 01:11:47,838
until they rule
our every thought.

863
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:53,110
The mind will do anything
to avoid confronting

864
01:11:53,112 --> 01:11:57,213
just how alone it is
in the universe.

865
01:12:02,988 --> 01:12:08,093
Luke, can you hear me?

866
01:12:08,095 --> 01:12:11,228
In the distance.

867
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:15,834
Follow the sound of my voice.

868
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:24,910
Daniel, can you hear me?

869
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:43,830
Daniel, talk to me.

870
01:13:01,584 --> 01:13:03,382
Daniel?

871
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Daniel, talk to me.
About what?

872
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:34,082
It's just like you said.

873
01:13:34,084 --> 01:13:36,417
He's weak.

874
01:13:36,419 --> 01:13:38,352
He's lonely.

875
01:13:41,457 --> 01:13:44,392
And he's nothing without me.

876
01:13:53,403 --> 01:13:56,038
What are you?

877
01:13:56,040 --> 01:14:01,377
Oh, just a traveler...

878
01:14:01,379 --> 01:14:07,249
searching for a home.

879
01:14:07,251 --> 01:14:11,121
This is going to be
really painful for you.

880
01:14:25,703 --> 01:14:28,071
Oh, my God.

881
01:14:33,445 --> 01:14:37,148
Fuck!
Oh, my god!

882
01:14:43,388 --> 01:14:45,488
Fuck!

883
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:48,091
Oh, my god!

884
01:15:10,116 --> 01:15:13,053
Stay back. Stay away.

885
01:15:15,121 --> 01:15:23,463
You know, the more you tell
somebody not to do something...

886
01:15:23,465 --> 01:15:26,168
the more they just go ahead
and do it.

887
01:15:34,742 --> 01:15:37,310
It's okay.
I feel a lot better now.

888
01:17:21,453 --> 01:17:26,192
I am the abyss.

889
01:17:27,594 --> 01:17:30,460
Get in. Get in.

890
01:17:30,462 --> 01:17:32,864
Get in. Get in.

891
01:17:32,866 --> 01:17:34,898
Get in. Get in.

892
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,667
Get in. Get in.

893
01:17:36,669 --> 01:17:38,468
Get in. Get in.

894
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:39,603
Get in. Get in.

895
01:17:39,605 --> 01:17:41,606
Get in. Get in.

896
01:17:41,608 --> 01:17:43,575
Get in. Get in.

897
01:17:43,577 --> 01:17:45,680
Get in.

898
01:17:52,285 --> 01:17:55,653
Behold.

899
01:17:55,655 --> 01:17:58,223
Your castle, sire.

900
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

901
01:20:32,486 --> 01:20:34,787
No!

902
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:37,422
Wait!

903
01:20:37,424 --> 01:20:38,792
Wait!

904
01:20:40,561 --> 01:20:44,395
Wait! Wait!

905
01:21:29,645 --> 01:21:31,379
I need to be sure
you're completely calmed down

906
01:21:31,381 --> 01:21:32,746
before I even think
about letting you in.

907
01:21:32,748 --> 01:21:34,915
I know.

908
01:21:34,917 --> 01:21:37,884
I wasn't in control before,
but I'm...

909
01:21:37,886 --> 01:21:39,887
I'm doing a lot better now.

910
01:21:39,889 --> 01:21:42,389
- Great.
- You know how it is.

911
01:21:42,391 --> 01:21:46,428
When you get so angry,
you just can't control it.

912
01:22:07,751 --> 01:22:12,788
You know, I really do like this.

913
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:15,591
People usually don't see me,

914
01:22:15,593 --> 01:22:18,160
not like that.

915
01:23:10,884 --> 01:23:13,750
- Luke.
- Ugh.

916
01:23:13,752 --> 01:23:16,254
I know you feel alone

917
01:23:16,256 --> 01:23:18,822
and like you can't get rid
of your shadows, but...

918
01:23:18,824 --> 01:23:22,594
I don't think we should get
rid of the shadows.

919
01:23:22,596 --> 01:23:25,730
I think that we should let
that shadows rule us.

920
01:23:35,042 --> 01:23:37,242
Hey.

921
01:23:37,244 --> 01:23:41,714
We should go away together,
don't you think?

922
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:43,250
Yes.

923
01:23:43,252 --> 01:23:45,985
Uh, what did you have in mind?

924
01:23:45,987 --> 01:23:47,621
Uh, I don't know.

925
01:23:47,623 --> 01:23:50,890
We could rob a bank,
fly around the world,

926
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:54,261
start a revolution somewhere.

927
01:24:14,884 --> 01:24:21,756
Remember when you painted me?

928
01:24:21,758 --> 01:24:27,794
You wanted to touch
that darkness, didn't you?

929
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:29,730
You don't get it.

930
01:24:29,732 --> 01:24:34,002
I saw the true Luke.

931
01:24:34,004 --> 01:24:36,905
I wanted that shadow
to go the fuck away.

932
01:24:52,656 --> 01:24:54,125
Fine.

933
01:24:58,329 --> 01:25:02,965
I've been...
I've been kind to you.

934
01:25:02,967 --> 01:25:11,340
I've shown you sensitivity.

935
01:25:11,342 --> 01:25:13,809
Fuck this whole charade.

936
01:25:13,811 --> 01:25:16,778
I am so sick of this face.

937
01:25:49,782 --> 01:25:54,985
Oh, my God.
Luke.

938
01:25:54,987 --> 01:25:56,721
Cassie.

939
01:25:56,723 --> 01:25:58,757
I've worn a lot of
different faces.

940
01:25:58,759 --> 01:26:01,659
Cassie?

941
01:27:10,734 --> 01:27:12,733
No!

942
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

943
01:27:42,066 --> 01:27:44,100
You John Thigpen?

944
01:27:51,076 --> 01:27:53,008
You're John Thigpen, aren't you?

945
01:27:53,010 --> 01:27:56,012
Uh-huh.

946
01:27:56,014 --> 01:27:58,882
How do I get out of here?

947
01:28:05,991 --> 01:28:07,525
Get back here!

948
01:28:12,165 --> 01:28:14,565
Where's Luke?

949
01:28:23,009 --> 01:28:25,910
I know you're in there.

950
01:28:31,284 --> 01:28:33,285
What's out there?

951
01:28:33,287 --> 01:28:37,988
The abyss.

952
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:41,559
And what did they do to us?

953
01:29:29,879 --> 01:29:32,945
Luke!

954
01:29:32,947 --> 01:29:35,349
I know you're in there.

955
01:29:45,028 --> 01:29:47,628
Luke!

956
01:30:00,277 --> 01:30:02,209
You're a fucking parasite!

957
01:30:02,211 --> 01:30:04,311
For centuries,
I've helped people.

958
01:30:04,313 --> 01:30:06,213
I've solved their problems.

959
01:30:06,215 --> 01:30:12,120
I've given them visions, and no
one has deserved any of it.

960
01:30:12,122 --> 01:30:14,188
You're the parasite, Luke.

961
01:31:58,132 --> 01:32:00,098
If I go,

962
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,103
you go.

963
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:12,312
You're not strong enough.

964
01:32:38,141 --> 01:32:39,143
Luke.

965
01:32:40,811 --> 01:32:42,013
Luke.

966
01:32:44,513 --> 01:32:45,516
Luke!

967
01:34:11,108 --> 01:34:16,108
