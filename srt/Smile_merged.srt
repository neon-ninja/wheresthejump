00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:06,087
Dr. Cotter.

3
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,855
He's gonna die.
She's gonna die.

4
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:09,857
Mom's gonna die. I'm
gonna die. Everybody dies.

5
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:12,526
I don't wanna... I'm gonna...

6
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:15,595
I haven't been able
to get him to talk...

7
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,131
respond to me, nothing.

8
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:20,168
Just this.

9
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:22,536
Yeah.
I got it.

10
00:02:23,304 --> 00:02:24,439
Thanks, Dan.

11
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:25,806
She's gonna die.
Mom's gonna die.

12
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,408
I'm gonna die.
Everyone dies.

13
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,277
Nobody matters.
She doesn't matter.

14
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,478
He doesn't matter. She doesn't
matter. Mom doesn't matter.

15
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:33,181
I don't matter.
Nothing ever matters.

16
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:36,050
I don't matter. I don't
matter. I don't matter.

17
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:37,784
He's gonna die.
She's gonna die.

18
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,988
He's gonna die. I'm
gonna die. Everyone dies.

19
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:41,889
Nobody matters.
She doesn't matter.

20
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:43,858
He doesn't matter. She
doesn't matter. Everyone dies.

21
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:45,259
I'm gonna die.
Nobody matters.

22
00:02:45,393 --> 00:02:47,462
She doesn't matter.
He doesn't matter.

23
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:48,997
Mom doesn't matter.
Nothing ever matters.

24
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,865
I don't matter.
I don't ma...

25
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:53,401
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

26
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:56,636
She's gonna... She's gonna...
Everyone... I'm gonna...

27
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,007
I don't matter.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

28
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:06,180
Hi, Carl.

29
00:03:08,316 --> 00:03:09,917
What's going on today?

30
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:13,354
I'm dying.

31
00:03:13,488 --> 00:03:14,755
No.

32
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:17,191
I don't think so.

33
00:03:20,028 --> 00:03:22,130
I think you're having
another manic episode.

34
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:23,331
Don't...

35
00:03:23,898 --> 00:03:25,532
Don't you tell me.

36
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:27,634
You don't know.

37
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:31,571
I feel it all around me,
squeezing.

38
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:37,879
I'm scared.

39
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:43,583
Carl, I know that what
you're experiencing feels real,

40
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:45,987
but it can't hurt you.

41
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:51,625
I promise.

42
00:03:51,758 --> 00:03:53,828
He's gonna die.
She's gonna die.

43
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:55,796
Mom's gonna die.
I'm gonna die.

44
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,199
Everyone dies.
Nobody matters.

45
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:02,336
Hey, Wanda. I'm gonna put Carl
Renken into observation for a few days.

46
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,539
He's harmless. Just make
sure someone checks on him

47
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:05,672
every couple hours.

48
00:04:05,806 --> 00:04:07,375
You got it.
Thanks.

49
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:09,877
Hey, Dr. Desai
was looking for you.

50
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:11,578
Thank you.

51
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:25,893
No! No! Please!

52
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:28,930
Please! You don't understand!
I can't go in there! No!

53
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:32,732
No! No! Please!

54
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:34,634
No!

55
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:36,971
No!

56
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,022
Come in.

57
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,894
Hey, did you send
a patient named, uh,

58
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:02,629
Sarah Marquet
over to residency yesterday?

59
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:05,433
Yes. She has a history
with drug abuse and mania,

60
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:08,369
and she's been in and out
of our unit a few times.

61
00:05:08,503 --> 00:05:09,871
Rose, she has no insurance.

62
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:11,372
Okay, but she needs treatment.

63
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:13,707
The board is down my throat
about paying out of pocket

64
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:15,510
for another bed
in the residency program.

65
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:17,245
Maybe the board should try
giving a shit

66
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:20,214
about the point of our
job here once in a while.

67
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:23,683
I'm not questioning
your judgment.

68
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:25,086
I just need you to
come to me first

69
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:26,954
so I can get ahead of
it next time. All right?

70
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:28,289
Yes.

71
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:30,191
Okay. I'm sorry.

72
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:33,427
Hey, you haven't been here since
the late shift last night, have you?

73
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:09,830
Dr. Cotter.

74
00:06:09,964 --> 00:06:11,933
Laura Weaver, 26.
She's a grad student.

75
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:14,068
Police were called on her
for public disturbance.

76
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:16,103
EMS brought her in.
Got any psych history?

77
00:06:16,237 --> 00:06:18,139
Nothing on file, but the
police sent over a report

78
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:20,641
for a different incident she
was involved in last week.

79
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:22,443
And what was that one about?

80
00:06:22,577 --> 00:06:25,745
A professor at her school bludgeoned
himself to death with a hammer.

81
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,149
She was interviewed
as the only witness.

82
00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:29,749
A hammer?

83
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:40,962
Hi.

84
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:42,530
Laura?

85
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:49,337
My name is Dr. Cotter.
I'm a therapist.

86
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,972
Do you wanna sit down?

87
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:55,276
Okay.

88
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:58,913
I know you're nervous.

89
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:00,747
That's okay.

90
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:03,551
I just wanna have a chat.

91
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:06,020
I promise this is a safe place.

92
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:08,456
Not for me.

93
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:11,559
Why do you say that?

94
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:19,433
Come on. Let's sit.

95
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:28,843
Please.

96
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:50,031
Okay. I'm gonna have to ask you a couple
of questions that might sound stupid.

97
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:55,369
What day of the week is it?

98
00:07:56,304 --> 00:07:57,338
Thursday.

99
00:07:58,372 --> 00:07:59,440
And the month?

100
00:07:59,573 --> 00:08:00,975
October.
I'm not crazy.

101
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:03,544
Nobody's saying that.
But I need you to understand.

102
00:08:03,678 --> 00:08:06,747
I'm a PhD candidate. I'm
not some lunatic. Okay?

103
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:08,883
Let's just take a breath,

104
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:12,019
and you can just
tell me what's going on.

105
00:08:22,063 --> 00:08:23,998
I'm seeing something.

106
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:28,536
Something no one else
can see except for me.

107
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,640
I know how insane that sounds.
I do.

108
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:36,477
But it's... This thing,
I can't explain it.

109
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:39,480
What is it you're seeing?

110
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:42,216
It looks like people,

111
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,285
but it's... it's not a person.

112
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:47,121
I'm not sure I understand.

113
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:49,423
It looks like people.
It looks like different people.

114
00:08:49,557 --> 00:08:52,193
Sometimes it pretends
to be someone that I know.

115
00:08:52,326 --> 00:08:54,995
Sometimes it's a random
stranger. Sometimes...

116
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:57,531
Sometimes it looks like
my grandfather

117
00:08:57,665 --> 00:09:00,368
who died in front of me
when I was seven.

118
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:05,306
But it's all the same thing.
It...

119
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,577
It's... It's like...

120
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:15,316
It's... It's like it wears
people's faces like... like masks.

121
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:17,918
Okay.

122
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:20,321
Do you see it right now, here?

123
00:09:23,991 --> 00:09:26,293
What happens when you do see it?

124
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:31,632
It's smiling at me.

125
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,402
But not a friendly smile.

126
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:36,303
It's the worst smile
I've ever seen in my life.

127
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:38,606
And whenever I see it,
I just get this

128
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:43,377
god-awful feeling like something
really terrible is gonna happen.

129
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:47,314
I've never felt scared
like I do when I see it.

130
00:09:48,716 --> 00:09:51,385
Laura, have you
or anyone else in your family

131
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,721
ever experienced hallucinations?

132
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:55,891
It's not a hallucination, no.
It's real.

133
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:57,958
You don't get it.
It does things to me.

134
00:09:58,092 --> 00:10:00,060
It causes shit
to happen around me.

135
00:10:00,194 --> 00:10:04,098
It's taken over my whole life
and my mind and...

136
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:06,902
it tells me things.

137
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:11,338
It told me that to...
today... Today's the...

138
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:14,942
Today's the day that I'm...
I'm gonna...

139
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:16,677
Okay. That's okay.

140
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:18,112
That's okay.

141
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:24,585
I know that what you're
experiencing feels incredibly real.

142
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:27,555
Sometimes, when we get
emotionally overwhelmed,

143
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:31,292
or experience an intense trauma,
our minds tend to...

144
00:10:31,425 --> 00:10:33,160
You're not listening to me.

145
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:34,795
Oh, my God.

146
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:39,166
I'm gonna fucking die,
and no one will listen to me.

147
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,035
Okay. Laura, it's okay.

148
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:43,404
Oh, God.

149
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:45,907
Hey, it's okay. Laura.

150
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,309
Hey, c-can you look at me,
please?

151
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,744
It's okay.

152
00:10:51,913 --> 00:10:53,080
Look at me.

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I...

154
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:01,789
Oh, my God. No!

155
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:03,090
No! It's here!

156
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:04,425
Please!
Laura. It's okay.

157
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:05,793
It's just us.
Get away! Please!

158
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:07,027
There's nobody else here.
No!

159
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:11,398
No!

160
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:19,373
Oh, my God.

161
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:23,912
I... I have a patient
emergency in eval 2.

162
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:25,847
I need staff here now.

163
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:26,915
Hurry.

164
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:49,270
Laura?

165
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

166
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:07,341
Had Ms. Weaver
ever been a patient here before?

167
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:11,679
No. Would you say she was
typical of the patients you see here?

168
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:15,083
This is an emergency
psychiatric unit.

169
00:14:15,884 --> 00:14:18,086
Typical is not really
a thing here.

170
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:20,187
Right. But she was
a head case, yeah?

171
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,623
I'm sorry, a head case?

172
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:28,429
I think we're just trying
to get your opinion

173
00:14:28,562 --> 00:14:30,698
of her mental state.

174
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,501
She could've been suffering from

175
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:37,504
acute post-trauma psychosis.

176
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,342
She was having
paranoid delusions.

177
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:44,244
What kind of delusions?

178
00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:46,613
She was convinced that some

179
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:50,584
sort of evil presence
was haunting her.

180
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:52,686
Yikes.

181
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:57,158
It's just, we're gonna have to
contact Ms. Weaver's family

182
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,027
and attempt to explain
what happened.

183
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,997
So we're looking for anything that
might make some sense of all this.

184
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:07,468
If there's anything else you
can tell us that... that might help.

185
00:15:16,276 --> 00:15:20,647
Uh, before she died...

186
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:26,121
she was... smiling.

187
00:15:26,855 --> 00:15:29,790
Yeah, she sounds
fucking crazy to me.

188
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Rose.

189
00:18:12,854 --> 00:18:13,855
Whoa.

190
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:17,926
My bad. Did I scare you?

191
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,028
I didn't hear you come in.
Shit.

192
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:21,863
Hi.
Hi.

193
00:18:21,996 --> 00:18:23,031
Hi.

194
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:25,967
What's up?

195
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,468
Nothing. Sorry.

196
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,039
Something's wrong.

197
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:36,177
A patient died today.

198
00:18:36,311 --> 00:18:37,879
My patient.

199
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:39,280
Oh.

200
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:41,015
Hey, come here.

201
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,450
I'm sorry.

202
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:46,687
It happened
right in front of me.

203
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:48,655
It was awful.

204
00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:51,758
I'm so sorry.
What can I do?

205
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:57,198
This is a nice start.

206
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:05,940
Maybe we should
bail on dinner tonight.

207
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:10,912
We can't.

208
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:14,148
Holly hired a sitter,

209
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:17,118
and it's just gonna be a
bigger headache if we don't go.

210
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:19,486
No way. Holly turning
into a headache?

211
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,224
Hey.

212
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:36,636
I'm sorry, you wanna
talk about being tired?

213
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,139
Now that Jackson's
in the first grade,

214
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:40,942
I'm literally up
at 6:00 a.m. every day

215
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:43,244
to make him breakfast
and pack him lunch.

216
00:19:43,378 --> 00:19:47,081
God knows what kind of non organic
garbage that cafeteria is even serving.

217
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:48,715
Then I have to drive him
to school,

218
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,617
barely have any time
to run my own errands.

219
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:53,888
Like, I haven't been to Pilates in
weeks. Okay, my body is so fucked.

220
00:19:54,022 --> 00:19:55,923
Not true. I have to go
back to school, pick him up,

221
00:19:56,057 --> 00:19:59,894
then I have to take him to either soccer
practice, swim lessons, karate, theater...

222
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:01,929
Oh, and he just started
taking Spanish.

223
00:20:02,063 --> 00:20:05,599
I mean, my weekdays
are literally impossible.

224
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:09,971
Mmm. You are coming
Saturday, right?

225
00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:12,173
What?

226
00:20:12,874 --> 00:20:14,942
Uh, sorry, what's Saturday?

227
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:16,911
I'm sorry, is that a joke? Wow.

228
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:19,147
Rose, Jackson's seventh
birthday party. Wow.

229
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,282
I've told you, like, five times.

230
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:22,884
I can't. I have work.

231
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:25,486
What do you mean work?
It's Saturday.

232
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:26,553
I work Saturday.

233
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:28,056
See, this is exactly why

234
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:29,623
you have to
get out of that gross hospital

235
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:31,658
and into a private practice...
Gross?

236
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:33,828
It is not gross.
...working normal-people hours.

237
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:36,730
Rose, there have to be
plenty of crazies out there

238
00:20:36,864 --> 00:20:38,598
who will actually
pay you for your time.

239
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:41,269
Thank you so much
for your input, Greg.

240
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:42,537
That's very sweet.

241
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:44,138
I'm just saying,
why become a doctor

242
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:46,441
if you can't get
disgustingly rich?

243
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:47,842
You're kidding, right?

244
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:50,644
Rose loves being a doctor.
She'd do it for free.

245
00:20:50,777 --> 00:20:52,980
What...

246
00:20:54,482 --> 00:20:56,616
Well, on the subject
of wasted earning potentials,

247
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,320
we could always sell the fucking
house. Can we not right now?

248
00:20:59,454 --> 00:21:01,556
I don't understand you.
It's just sitting there.

249
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:03,458
We grew up in that house.

250
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,461
Rose, it's a total teardown. Why
not just get the money for the land?

251
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:08,595
Can you guys just
shut the fuck up?

252
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:10,998
Wow.

253
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,733
Thank you.

254
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:15,369
Thank you so much.
Sure.

255
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:19,307
I've been
looking forward to this.

256
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,673
You okay?

257
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:55,143
Yeah.

258
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,195
Morning, Doc.

259
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:18,732
Morning.

260
00:22:27,475 --> 00:22:30,378
Hey. Yesterday,
that patient, Laura Weaver...

261
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:34,549
The police had sent a report about a
different incident that she was involved in.

262
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:35,850
Can you get that
forwarded to me?

263
00:22:35,983 --> 00:22:37,351
You got it, Doc.

264
00:22:37,485 --> 00:22:39,719
Also, I was supposed to have
a session with Jane Park.

265
00:22:39,854 --> 00:22:43,858
Oh, yeah. She pulled out a bunch of
her hair overnight and swallowed it all.

266
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:46,527
They took her down to medicine
to have her stomach pumped.

267
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,996
Shit.

268
00:22:49,597 --> 00:22:51,265
Uh, Rose.

269
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:57,672
What... What are you... I was
on a... I was on a call nearby,

270
00:22:57,804 --> 00:22:59,473
and I just thought I would...

271
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:01,475
Um...

272
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:03,477
You know, we didn't really
get to talk yesterday,

273
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:06,447
other than the whole...
Whole thing.

274
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:09,684
And I just wanted you to know
that when the call came in,

275
00:23:09,816 --> 00:23:12,086
I had no idea
it was gonna be you.

276
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,854
So, I'm sorry if that was weird.

277
00:23:13,988 --> 00:23:16,057
It's your job. I get it.

278
00:23:17,592 --> 00:23:18,659
How you been?

279
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:20,995
Joel, why are you here?

280
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:24,498
You know, like I said, I was
on a call nearby, and I just,

281
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:26,200
you know, thought I would...

282
00:23:27,535 --> 00:23:29,837
come check on you.

283
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:33,574
After everything that happened yesterday,
that's... that's not an easy thing.

284
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:37,411
Okay. I appreciate it, but I
don't need you to check on me.

285
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:43,484
Right.

286
00:23:43,618 --> 00:23:46,420
No, yeah, I mean... Sorry.

287
00:23:47,787 --> 00:23:49,323
I have to get back to work.

288
00:23:49,457 --> 00:23:50,558
Yeah.

289
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:52,059
See you around.

290
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:00,868
You do know
she's engaged, right?

291
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:04,839
Yeah.

292
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:08,409
I'm single.

293
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:45,946
- Hello.
<i>- Hi.</i>

294
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,582
<i>Um, look, I just wanted to say
sorry about last night, okay?</i>

295
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:51,852
<i>I shouldn't have
kept going at you like that.</i>

296
00:24:51,986 --> 00:24:53,521
Uh, no, I...

297
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:55,756
I should apologize.

298
00:24:56,524 --> 00:24:58,759
I've been just dealing
with some stuff.

299
00:24:58,893 --> 00:25:01,295
I wasn't being
very good company.

300
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:04,065
<i>Okay. If you can't make it to
your nephew's party tomorrow,</i>

301
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:06,400
<i>you could at least
get him a present.</i>

302
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:09,837
<i>If you need an idea, he's
really into electric model trains.</i>

303
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,305
Uh-huh.

304
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:13,808
<i>You sound weird.
Are you okay?</i>

305
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:16,210
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

306
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:43,237
Hey, Carl.

307
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:46,907
How you feeling today?

308
00:25:57,485 --> 00:25:58,619
Carl.

309
00:26:03,891 --> 00:26:05,226
Carl?

310
00:26:11,065 --> 00:26:13,434
She's gonna die.
I'm gonna die.

311
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:15,503
Everybody dies.
Carl, look at me.

312
00:26:15,636 --> 00:26:17,438
You're going to die.

313
00:26:17,571 --> 00:26:19,006
You're going to die.

314
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,608
You're going to die.

315
00:26:20,741 --> 00:26:24,245
You're going to die.
You're going to die.

316
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:27,648
You're going to die.
You're going to die.

317
00:26:27,782 --> 00:26:29,250
You're going to die.
Help!

318
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:31,485
Help! This patient is 5150!

319
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:33,921
He needs to be restrained!
Go, go, go!

320
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:36,824
No! No!

321
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:38,325
No!

322
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:42,696
No! No! No! No!

323
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:44,799
No! No!

324
00:26:44,932 --> 00:26:47,535
No! No!

325
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:50,104
No!

326
00:27:00,514 --> 00:27:02,216
He was aggressive.

327
00:27:02,716 --> 00:27:04,752
Acting psychotic.

328
00:27:04,886 --> 00:27:07,521
Carl Renken has been in
and out of here a dozen times

329
00:27:07,655 --> 00:27:10,758
and has never exhibited behavior
even remotely aggressive.

330
00:27:10,892 --> 00:27:13,160
Do you think I'm making
it up? Of course not.

331
00:27:13,294 --> 00:27:15,496
But yesterday,
a patient in your care

332
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:18,432
killed herself brutally
in front of you.

333
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:21,035
Is it possible,
when you presumed

334
00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:23,003
that Carl Renken
was a danger to himself,

335
00:27:23,137 --> 00:27:25,573
that that's what your mind
was reacting to?

336
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:32,980
I suppose I could've misinterpreted
the situation and overreacted.

337
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:36,550
Okay.

338
00:27:36,684 --> 00:27:39,487
So, here's what's gonna happen.

339
00:27:40,454 --> 00:27:42,423
You're gonna take
a paid week off.

340
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:44,291
Morgan,
that's really not necessary.

341
00:27:44,425 --> 00:27:47,661
You've been working
80-hour weeks for months.

342
00:27:47,795 --> 00:27:50,364
I'm concerned
that you haven't been sleeping.

343
00:27:50,498 --> 00:27:54,435
We can't help these patients unless
we have our own mental health in check.

344
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:56,337
And it's in
the unit's best interest

345
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,506
if you just take a week
and clear your head.

346
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:02,176
Just do what you gotta do
and come back focused, okay?

347
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

348
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:16,503
Fuck!

349
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

350
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:29,576
Hello?
<i>This is First Line Security.</i>

351
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,046
<i>May I have your name
and the pass code?</i>

352
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,082
Uh, Rose Cotter.

353
00:32:34,215 --> 00:32:35,582
Um, "Acapulco."

354
00:32:35,716 --> 00:32:37,384
<i>Ma'am, we've detected
a door alarm.</i>

355
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:41,288
Yeah, uh, the... the back
door of my house is open.

356
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:43,457
<i>Are you alone
in the house, ma'am?</i>

357
00:32:43,892 --> 00:32:45,026
Yes.

358
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,627
<i>Are you sure?</i>

359
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:52,399
What? <i>Are you sure you haven't
let something inside, Rose?</i>

360
00:32:55,003 --> 00:32:56,670
<i>Look behind you.</i>

361
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

362
00:33:27,101 --> 00:33:28,402
Shit.

363
00:33:36,044 --> 00:33:37,145
Hello?

364
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:38,645
<i>This is First Line Security.</i>

365
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:41,049
<i>May I have your name
and the pass code?</i>

366
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:04,538
We did a full sweep
inside and out. It's all clear.

367
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:07,175
Um, what about the back door?

368
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:10,777
Is it possible it wasn't fully
latched last time it was closed?

369
00:34:12,247 --> 00:34:14,315
I... I don't know.
Maybe.

370
00:34:14,448 --> 00:34:15,582
Hey, I wouldn't worry about it.

371
00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:18,119
These false alarms
happen all the time.

372
00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:21,055
If anything else comes up,
you can give us a call.

373
00:34:22,023 --> 00:34:23,057
Okay.

374
00:34:23,892 --> 00:34:25,293
Evening, sir.

375
00:34:25,425 --> 00:34:28,062
Um, evening.

376
00:34:31,665 --> 00:34:33,067
What happened?

377
00:34:36,503 --> 00:34:37,872
Mustache?

378
00:34:39,473 --> 00:34:41,009
Mustache.

379
00:34:41,142 --> 00:34:44,811
So, is there a reason
you set the alarm?

380
00:34:44,946 --> 00:34:45,847
Uh...

381
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,216
I literally
don't remember doing it.

382
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:51,785
I must have just, like,
set it by accident or something.

383
00:34:53,354 --> 00:34:54,821
By accident?

384
00:34:56,324 --> 00:34:57,557
Sorry. Sorry.

385
00:34:57,691 --> 00:34:59,693
My head has just been
in this, like,

386
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:02,663
foggy, creepy,
spacey place all day.

387
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:05,699
And there was this weird
incident at work and then...

388
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:08,435
And then my boss
is making me take a...

389
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:14,441
Sorry.

390
00:35:14,574 --> 00:35:17,477
Everything is okay.
Are you sure?

391
00:35:17,611 --> 00:35:20,747
No, no, I'm fine.
I was just venting.

392
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:23,952
Okay.

393
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:30,490
Can you see
if you can find Mustache?

394
00:35:30,624 --> 00:35:32,459
I haven't seen him
anywhere at all.

395
00:35:32,592 --> 00:35:33,928
Yeah.

396
00:35:40,401 --> 00:35:42,769
Rose, did you
break another glass?

397
00:35:47,442 --> 00:35:48,843
Mustache?

398
00:35:52,246 --> 00:35:53,747
Come on, kitty.

399
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,518
Please. Please.

400
00:36:02,223 --> 00:36:03,657
Mustache.

401
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

402
00:36:58,745 --> 00:37:01,615
<i>It looks like people.
It looks like different people.</i>

403
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:04,085
<i>Sometimes it pretends
to be someone that I know.</i>

404
00:37:04,218 --> 00:37:06,988
<i>Sometimes it's a random
stranger. Sometimes...</i>

405
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:09,689
<i>Sometimes it looks like
my grandfather</i>

406
00:37:09,823 --> 00:37:12,393
<i>who died in front of me
when I was seven.</i>

407
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:15,063
<i>- But it's all the same thing.
- It...</i>

408
00:37:15,196 --> 00:37:17,865
<i>It's smiling at me,
but not a friendly smile.</i>

409
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:20,068
<i>It's the worst smile
I've ever seen in my life.</i>

410
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:22,904
<i>And whenever I see it, I
just get this god-awful feeling</i>

411
00:37:23,037 --> 00:37:26,307
<i>like something really terrible
is gonna happen.</i>

412
00:37:27,641 --> 00:37:30,411
<i>Oh, my God! No! No!</i>

413
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:33,281
<i>No! It's here! Please!</i>

414
00:37:33,414 --> 00:37:36,184
<i>Get away! Please! No!</i>

415
00:37:37,751 --> 00:37:39,786
<i>I... I have
a patient emergency in eval 2.</i>

416
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:42,957
<i>I need staff here now. Hurry.</i>

417
00:37:44,591 --> 00:37:45,993
<i>Laura?</i>

418
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,072
<i>Laura?</i>

419
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,817
<i>Laura?</i>

420
00:38:10,952 --> 00:38:13,287
<i>Rose.</i>

421
00:38:21,295 --> 00:38:22,830
<i>Laura?</i>

422
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Rose!

423
00:38:44,352 --> 00:38:45,319
Rose?

424
00:38:45,453 --> 00:38:48,156
Whoa! Oh, my God! Rose!
Rose! Whoa, whoa!

425
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:50,724
What the fuck?
Rose, put the knife down!

426
00:38:55,196 --> 00:38:56,164
Rose!

427
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:15,883
Hi.

428
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:18,920
Rose?

429
00:39:20,288 --> 00:39:21,989
This is a surprise.

430
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:27,261
It wasn't so much the blood.

431
00:39:27,395 --> 00:39:28,795
It was, um...

432
00:39:29,763 --> 00:39:31,532
her face.

433
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:33,733
The look that she had.

434
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:36,137
How did it make you feel?

435
00:39:37,737 --> 00:39:38,973
Uh...

436
00:39:39,473 --> 00:39:41,275
Terrified, obviously.

437
00:39:43,444 --> 00:39:44,478
Um...

438
00:39:45,446 --> 00:39:47,081
Vulnerable.

439
00:39:47,548 --> 00:39:48,950
Guilty.

440
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,384
Guilty?

441
00:39:51,018 --> 00:39:52,587
Well, she was my patient.

442
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,958
She was a disturbed young woman
you only met for ten minutes.

443
00:39:57,091 --> 00:39:59,227
Yeah. I just...

444
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:02,163
I just feel like
I've gotten stuck on it.

445
00:40:02,296 --> 00:40:04,764
I can't, you know,
get it out of my head.

446
00:40:04,899 --> 00:40:08,402
Have you considered
the reason you feel stuck

447
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:11,472
could actually be more about
your mother's suicide?

448
00:40:16,043 --> 00:40:18,246
Do you still blame yourself?

449
00:40:20,147 --> 00:40:21,616
That...

450
00:40:21,748 --> 00:40:23,217
I'm really not trying
to relitigate

451
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:26,420
that part of my life
right now. So...

452
00:40:27,955 --> 00:40:30,124
What would you like
to talk about?

453
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:37,198
I was hoping that I could get
a script for Risperdal.

454
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:44,905
Ever since that...

455
00:40:46,707 --> 00:40:48,542
patient, I've been, um...

456
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:52,280
seeing things

457
00:40:53,114 --> 00:40:55,049
and hearing things.

458
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:59,053
I'm sure it's just a symptom
of post-trauma.

459
00:40:59,186 --> 00:41:01,956
Let's avoid any self-diagnosis.

460
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,860
What is it you've been seeing
and hearing?

461
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,999
Echoes of what happened
with my patient.

462
00:41:12,133 --> 00:41:14,669
You know, just fleeting moments

463
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:17,204
of stress-induced
hallucinations.

464
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:22,510
But when they're happening,
they feel so...

465
00:41:23,744 --> 00:41:27,615
corporeal and unsettling.

466
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:33,254
Rose, from where I'm sitting, you don't
seem delusional or disordered to me.

467
00:41:33,988 --> 00:41:35,690
And certainly not psychotic.

468
00:41:35,822 --> 00:41:38,793
It's my impression this
experience with your patient

469
00:41:38,926 --> 00:41:40,294
triggered old anxieties

470
00:41:40,428 --> 00:41:42,530
compounded with too much
stress, not enough sleep.

471
00:41:42,663 --> 00:41:46,834
You have wounds
that have never fully healed.

472
00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:51,839
And it is possible they never will
completely. That's the nature of trauma.

473
00:41:51,972 --> 00:41:55,476
But you can learn
to get control over it.

474
00:41:56,877 --> 00:41:59,780
Have you been continuing
to see patients

475
00:41:59,914 --> 00:42:01,482
while you've been coping
with all this?

476
00:42:01,615 --> 00:42:05,853
No. I'm just taking
a short hiatus. Good.

477
00:42:07,054 --> 00:42:08,456
If you want my advice,

478
00:42:08,589 --> 00:42:10,257
use this time
to do something different.

479
00:42:10,391 --> 00:42:12,760
Anything that will
take your mind off

480
00:42:12,893 --> 00:42:14,995
the triggers
that are causing you stress.

481
00:42:15,129 --> 00:42:18,733
I also think it would be helpful

482
00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:22,403
if we resumed
our regular sessions again.

483
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:28,642
Sure.

484
00:42:33,347 --> 00:42:36,217
And what about the Risperdal?
Just... You know.

485
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:40,254
Let's talk again next week
before we consider any medication.

486
00:42:42,123 --> 00:42:44,592
In the meantime,
you can always call me.

487
00:42:48,462 --> 00:42:49,630
Sure.

488
00:43:21,061 --> 00:43:25,132
No, I asked you for
a white wine spritzer. Jesus.

489
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,904
Oh, my God. You made it.
Hi. Surprise.

490
00:43:29,036 --> 00:43:30,604
Come on in. Come on in.
Oh.

491
00:43:31,372 --> 00:43:33,240
I thought you had to work?

492
00:43:33,374 --> 00:43:35,911
Oh, I decided to take the
afternoon... I'll take that.

493
00:43:36,043 --> 00:43:37,511
Hey, Greg.
What are you doing?

494
00:43:37,645 --> 00:43:40,247
I told you not to take
those out yet. Mmm, mmm.

495
00:43:40,381 --> 00:43:41,615
Geez.

496
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:43,517
Uh, ladies, I have to go
corral my dipshit husband.

497
00:43:43,651 --> 00:43:46,353
Would one of you please show
my sister to the adult refreshments?

498
00:43:46,487 --> 00:43:48,956
Sure. We have a stash
in the kitchen. Come on.

499
00:43:49,089 --> 00:43:51,091
Wait.
You're that therapist, right?

500
00:43:51,225 --> 00:43:52,293
Yes, I... I am.

501
00:43:52,426 --> 00:43:54,195

into the ER.

How're you doing?

Fine.

00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,149
It was just an accident.
Thank you.

529
00:47:02,282 --> 00:47:06,820
Yeah. They... They said that
you had had a anxiety attack.

530
00:47:07,856 --> 00:47:10,058
Rose, I'll be honest with you,
I'm... I'm concerned.

531
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:11,492
And I... I mean this
as your friend,

532
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,694
but I really think you
should speak to someone.

533
00:47:13,827 --> 00:47:16,163
Are you seeing anybody
professionally right now?

534
00:47:22,403 --> 00:47:24,371
Rose, are you listening?

535
00:47:48,997 --> 00:47:50,230
Wait.

536
00:47:50,999 --> 00:47:52,666
I need to tell you something,

537
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,806
and I need you to know
that I'm not crazy, okay?

538
00:47:59,573 --> 00:48:00,507
Okay.

539
00:48:00,641 --> 00:48:01,709
Okay.

540
00:48:02,743 --> 00:48:03,777
Um...

541
00:48:04,979 --> 00:48:09,283
Something is happening to me.

542
00:48:12,887 --> 00:48:15,924
And it's gonna be really hard
for you to believe.

543
00:48:18,759 --> 00:48:20,728
Maybe we should just go inside.

544
00:48:20,862 --> 00:48:24,331
No, wait. Just listen to me!
Sorry. Sorry.

545
00:48:25,066 --> 00:48:26,567
I'm really sorry.

546
00:48:27,068 --> 00:48:28,502
Okay, um...

547
00:48:30,337 --> 00:48:32,073
Something is threatening me.

548
00:48:32,841 --> 00:48:38,345
Some kind of a evil spirit,
or energy.

549
00:48:38,479 --> 00:48:42,917
I... I don't really know
what it is, but...

550
00:48:43,051 --> 00:48:46,320
But I think that it...
It killed my patient.

551
00:48:46,453 --> 00:48:50,925
Because she described experiencing
the same thing before she died.

552
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:55,295
And now it's somehow
attached itself to me.

553
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:57,798
And...

554
00:48:59,134 --> 00:49:00,235
I'm just really scared

555
00:49:00,367 --> 00:49:03,037
that something bad
is going to happen.

556
00:49:09,244 --> 00:49:11,478
I really need you
to say something.

557
00:49:12,346 --> 00:49:14,381
What do you want me to say?

558
00:49:18,652 --> 00:49:19,888
I want you to believe me.

559
00:49:20,021 --> 00:49:22,257
Rose, you're talking about
a fucking ghost.

560
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:24,291
No, no, no. It's not...

561
00:49:24,424 --> 00:49:25,894
It's not a ghost.

562
00:49:26,693 --> 00:49:28,562
It's something else.

563
00:49:28,695 --> 00:49:29,898
Okay.

564
00:49:33,534 --> 00:49:35,003
I'm sorry.

565
00:49:36,137 --> 00:49:37,205
I can't.

566
00:49:37,939 --> 00:49:39,908
I cannot fucking do this
right now.

567
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:41,408
No. Trevor.

568
00:49:41,542 --> 00:49:43,845
Whoa, whoa, wait. No,
no, no. Don't walk away.

569
00:49:45,146 --> 00:49:46,346
I need you...

570
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,815
You're not listening
to what I am saying.

571
00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:49,349
Okay, Rose.

572
00:49:49,483 --> 00:49:53,787
What the fuck am I supposed to
say to respond to this right now?

573
00:49:53,922 --> 00:49:56,456
Do you hear yourself? I mean,
Jesus Christ. You sound crazy.

574
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,293
I am not crazy!

575
00:49:58,425 --> 00:50:00,527
Sorry. Sorry.

576
00:50:01,262 --> 00:50:03,064
But it's genetic, isn't it?

577
00:50:04,165 --> 00:50:05,566
What?

578
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,069
Mental illness.

579
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:11,072
You can inherit it
from a parent.

580
00:50:11,206 --> 00:50:12,140
I looked it up.

581
00:50:12,273 --> 00:50:13,842
Why would you look that up?

582
00:50:14,675 --> 00:50:17,078
Because...
I wanted to know

583
00:50:17,212 --> 00:50:20,814
what I was potentially
hitching my entire life to.

584
00:50:22,183 --> 00:50:23,985
Is that so fucking unfair?

585
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,922
I'm going in the house.

586
00:50:28,056 --> 00:50:30,624
No, no, no. Please,
Trevor. I'm in danger!

587
00:50:30,757 --> 00:50:31,825
Rose.

588
00:50:32,492 --> 00:50:34,494
Did you kill Mustache?
N... No!

589
00:50:34,628 --> 00:50:38,299
No! That was not...
That was not me.

590
00:50:38,432 --> 00:50:41,735
Then tell me,
what happened to him?

591
00:50:43,238 --> 00:50:45,706
It was the thing.

592
00:50:46,908 --> 00:50:48,775
Trevor, please.

593
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,711
Please. Please.

594
00:50:51,946 --> 00:50:53,982
Please. Please.

595
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Rose.

596
00:52:19,434 --> 00:52:20,801
Come here.

597
00:52:50,398 --> 00:52:51,631
Rose.

598
00:52:54,435 --> 00:52:55,837
Baby...

599
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,740
Please. Help me.

600
00:53:00,908 --> 00:53:04,012
- Mommy made a mistake.
- No, no, no.

601
00:53:06,713 --> 00:53:08,149
No, no, no.

602
00:53:11,052 --> 00:53:12,420
Rose!

603
00:53:12,552 --> 00:53:13,620
Look where you're going!

604
00:53:13,754 --> 00:53:16,190
Are you crazy?
Sorry. I'm sorry.

605
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,248
Mrs. Muñoz?

606
00:53:43,217 --> 00:53:44,618
At first,

607
00:53:44,751 --> 00:53:47,121
I noticed small changes in him.

608
00:53:49,823 --> 00:53:52,293
Then it all happened so fast.

609
00:53:54,295 --> 00:53:55,863
He was on edge.

610
00:53:56,563 --> 00:53:58,066
Paranoid.

611
00:53:59,467 --> 00:54:03,071
He would wake up in the
middle of the night, screaming.

612
00:54:05,073 --> 00:54:07,607
I'd never heard him
scream before.

613
00:54:09,877 --> 00:54:12,980
Then he just
stopped sleeping altogether.

614
00:54:15,615 --> 00:54:19,320
I would catch him having
these conversations with himself.

615
00:54:19,454 --> 00:54:21,089
He was seeing things.

616
00:54:21,856 --> 00:54:23,024
Doing strange things

617
00:54:23,157 --> 00:54:25,460
that he didn't even
seem to remember.

618
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:28,162
Then one morning he was gone.

619
00:54:29,464 --> 00:54:33,901
That night, the police called
and told me he was dead.

620
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
They asked me
to identify his body.
His face.

621
00:54:44,744 --> 00:54:46,813
Twenty-five years of marriage,

622
00:54:46,948 --> 00:54:50,017
and that's what I have left
to remember him.

623
00:54:53,687 --> 00:54:55,789
I'm so sorry.

624
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:11,873
Did Gabriel ever describe
the things that he was seeing?

625
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:17,811
I'll show you.

626
00:55:29,423 --> 00:55:31,392
I should take it all down,

627
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,428
but I can't stand being in here.

628
00:55:53,114 --> 00:55:56,050
This is what Gabriel said
he saw.

629
00:56:04,158 --> 00:56:08,329
He kept saying it was trying
to get inside of him.

630
00:56:10,764 --> 00:56:13,234
That is Gabriel's brother.

631
00:56:13,367 --> 00:56:16,938
He died in an accident
20 years ago.

632
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:20,007
Gabriel never got over it.

633
00:56:20,141 --> 00:56:21,909
How long had this been going on?

634
00:56:22,043 --> 00:56:25,846
Ever since he got back from that damn
conference he would go to every year.

635
00:56:27,381 --> 00:56:30,918
It was because he saw
that awful woman kill herself.

636
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,288
But no one reports on that.

637
00:56:36,691 --> 00:56:39,826
He watched someone
die by suicide?

638
00:56:41,362 --> 00:56:42,396
Yes.

639
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:43,931
I assumed you knew this.

640
00:56:44,065 --> 00:56:45,732
What was her name?

641
00:56:46,901 --> 00:56:49,337
I don't remember.
I'd have to find it.

642
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,773
Um...

643
00:56:54,609 --> 00:56:57,245
Did... Did he ever, um...

644
00:56:59,213 --> 00:57:00,982
say why
all of this was happening?

645
00:57:01,115 --> 00:57:04,818
Did he find any explanation
in all of this?

646
00:57:06,654 --> 00:57:07,989
What kind of reporter are you?

647
00:57:08,122 --> 00:57:12,426
Mrs. Muñoz,
your husband was not insane.

648
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,063
The things that he was seeing,
they're real. I've seen them.

649
00:57:16,197 --> 00:57:19,000
What are you, a fucking nutcase?

650
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:20,735
What? Some kind
of morbid fanatic?

651
00:57:20,868 --> 00:57:22,570
How fucking dare you?

652
00:57:22,703 --> 00:57:24,071
No, please. Please.

653
00:57:24,205 --> 00:57:26,574
What happened to your
husband is happening to me.

654
00:57:26,707 --> 00:57:28,743
Out of my house. I want
you out of my house, now.

655
00:57:28,876 --> 00:57:31,445
Just please give me the name.
Please, just give me the name!

656
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:34,148
Get the fuck out of my house!

657
00:58:09,984 --> 00:58:11,919
Oh, fuck. Shit.

658
00:58:24,598 --> 00:58:25,933
Yeah?

659
00:58:32,373 --> 00:58:33,474
Hey.

660
00:58:40,047 --> 00:58:41,549
Come on in.

661
00:58:55,262 --> 00:58:58,966
Finally got rid of
that ugly yellow couch.

662
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,369
Uh-huh.

663
00:59:01,969 --> 00:59:04,205
So, uh, what's up?

664
00:59:05,172 --> 00:59:07,007
I assume you're not here
to catch up

665
00:59:07,141 --> 00:59:10,311
considering the cold shoulder
the other day.

666
00:59:12,046 --> 00:59:14,181
I need a favor.

667
00:59:14,315 --> 00:59:16,484
I need you to not ask
any questions about it.

668
00:59:16,617 --> 00:59:19,553
Terrific.
Yeah, let's hear that.

669
00:59:19,687 --> 00:59:21,288
Uh, so, nine days ago,

670
00:59:21,422 --> 00:59:24,759
a man named Gabriel Muñoz
killed himself.

671
00:59:24,892 --> 00:59:30,798
I need to know if he had been involved
in any other recent police reports.

672
00:59:30,931 --> 00:59:33,501
Can you find that out?
Here, for me.

673
00:59:33,634 --> 00:59:35,436
Come on. Are you serious?

674
00:59:37,037 --> 00:59:39,540
This is my one day off.
Go to the station.

675
00:59:39,673 --> 00:59:41,175
Joel, please?

676
00:59:47,883 --> 00:59:49,116
Fine.

677
00:59:49,917 --> 00:59:51,385
Goddamn it.

678
00:59:55,857 --> 00:59:57,691
All right,
what was his name again?

679
00:59:58,459 --> 01:00:00,194
Gabriel Muñoz.

680
01:00:08,202 --> 01:00:10,938
All right.
I see the report on his death.

681
01:00:11,071 --> 01:00:13,140
Yeah. There's another
incident report here

682
01:00:13,274 --> 01:00:15,576
from a week earlier,
from a precinct upstate.

683
01:00:15,709 --> 01:00:18,679
What was it for?
He gave a witness statement.

684
01:00:18,813 --> 01:00:21,449
He was staying at a hotel where
a woman committed suicide.

685
01:00:21,582 --> 01:00:24,618
Okay, um... And what was
her name? The woman?

686
01:00:28,756 --> 01:00:29,957
Um,

687
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,959
Angela Powell.

688
01:00:32,092 --> 01:00:33,627
She's a real estate agent.

689
01:00:33,761 --> 01:00:35,062
What is this?

690
01:00:37,031 --> 01:00:39,200
Fuck.
What? What is it?

691
01:00:40,067 --> 01:00:41,602
It's a picture from the scene.

692
01:00:41,735 --> 01:00:43,637
Let me see it.
No.

693
01:00:43,771 --> 01:00:45,239
Let me see it.
No, no.

694
01:00:45,372 --> 01:00:47,174
Look, you don't wanna see this.
This is, like, evidence.

695
01:00:47,308 --> 01:00:49,677
Or, just, you know, have at it.

696
01:00:53,013 --> 01:00:54,381
Holy shit.

697
01:00:55,851 --> 01:00:57,651
Told you it was gross.

698
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,055
Okay, um...

699
01:01:02,623 --> 01:01:05,961
Okay, uh, I need you to do the same
search again, but this time on her.

700
01:01:06,093 --> 01:01:07,328
The woman, Angela.

701
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:08,930
Can you please tell me
what this is all about?

702
01:01:09,063 --> 01:01:12,199
Joel, you said you weren't
gonna ask me any questions.

703
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:14,535
No. You said I wouldn't
ask you any questions.

704
01:01:14,668 --> 01:01:16,604
Joel, I need your help.

705
01:01:17,605 --> 01:01:19,006
Okay?

706
01:01:22,076 --> 01:01:23,344
Please?

707
01:01:41,395 --> 01:01:42,129
Hmm.

708
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:43,832
There was a previous report

709
01:01:43,965 --> 01:01:46,500
filed four days
before her death.

710
01:01:47,836 --> 01:01:49,203
That's a weird coincidence.

711
01:01:49,336 --> 01:01:51,739
She was also interviewed
about a suicide.

712
01:02:01,415 --> 01:02:04,151
What is this?
Is that a video file?

713
01:02:07,254 --> 01:02:09,557
It's, um,
security camera footage.

714
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:13,127
Put it... Put it on.
Just... It's... It's loading.

715
01:02:22,871 --> 01:02:24,738
What the fuck is this?

716
01:02:57,104 --> 01:02:59,040
You know,
my day was going just fine.

717
01:02:59,173 --> 01:03:01,141
Can you rewind it?
Really?

718
01:03:01,275 --> 01:03:03,143
Rewind it, Joel.

719
01:03:08,315 --> 01:03:09,416
Okay, stop.

720
01:03:16,024 --> 01:03:17,725
Is he smiling?

721
01:03:27,002 --> 01:03:28,837
Rose, who are these people?

722
01:03:37,112 --> 01:03:38,646
I have to go.

723
01:03:39,346 --> 01:03:40,849
Where are you going?

724
01:03:42,683 --> 01:03:45,352
Rose, where are you going?
What is going on here?

725
01:03:45,486 --> 01:03:46,988
I'm so confused right now.

726
01:03:47,122 --> 01:03:48,756
Can you do me one more favor?

727
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:50,892
Do you have a printer?

728
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:32,366
Trevor. Trevor, you here?

729
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,635
Hey.

730
01:04:34,768 --> 01:04:36,303
Hi, Rose.

731
01:04:38,405 --> 01:04:40,541
What is this?
What is she doing here?

732
01:04:40,674 --> 01:04:42,443
I wanted to see
how you were doing.

733
01:04:42,576 --> 01:04:44,678
I was talking to my fiancé.

734
01:04:46,246 --> 01:04:47,448
I called her.

735
01:04:49,616 --> 01:04:50,617
Why?

736
01:04:51,986 --> 01:04:56,690
Because you've been acting
completely unhinged.

737
01:04:56,824 --> 01:04:57,791
I... I don't...

738
01:04:57,926 --> 01:04:59,526
And I... I didn't know
what else to do.

739
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,328
Are you fucking kidding me?

740
01:05:02,529 --> 01:05:06,266
I came to you, the person I'm
supposed to trust most in the world,

741
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,637
and I... I confided
that I was scared to death.

742
01:05:11,139 --> 01:05:13,875
That I needed you.

743
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:17,511
And you didn't listen
to a word I was saying.

744
01:05:17,644 --> 01:05:20,181
No. Why do you think
I even called her?

745
01:05:20,314 --> 01:05:22,217
All I'm trying to do here
is help you.

746
01:05:22,349 --> 01:05:25,220
No! All you're trying to do is make
it so you don't have to deal with it.

747
01:05:25,352 --> 01:05:29,190
You're fine as long as
everything is easy and agreeable,

748
01:05:29,323 --> 01:05:31,625
but God forbid
anything become real,

749
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:33,494
or even a tiny bit difficult.

750
01:05:33,627 --> 01:05:35,562
And... And you just...

751
01:05:35,696 --> 01:05:39,399
You just think about how it's gonna fuck
up your whole little perfect life plan.

752
01:05:39,533 --> 01:05:42,170
Are you serious right now?
Yeah.

753
01:05:42,302 --> 01:05:45,039
If that's how you feel,
then why are we even together?

754
01:05:46,174 --> 01:05:47,374
Maybe I just don't know.

755
01:05:47,508 --> 01:05:48,843
Why don't we all
just take a breath...

756
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:51,812
Why don't you just
fucking make yourself at home!

757
01:05:51,946 --> 01:05:54,916
Rose, are you
actually leaving right now?

758
01:06:06,493 --> 01:06:08,529
Greg. Rose, what
are you doing here?

759
01:06:08,662 --> 01:06:09,831
Is Holly here?
I need to talk to her.

760
01:06:09,964 --> 01:06:11,632
I don't think
that's a good idea.

761
01:06:11,765 --> 01:06:13,734
Greg, let me talk
to my fucking sister. Holly!

762
01:06:13,868 --> 01:06:15,402
You're gonna come
and talk to me like that?

763
01:06:15,536 --> 01:06:17,038
Holly, can I talk to you,
just for one sec?

764
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:18,806
No, I don't think...
Can I please talk to you?

765
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:20,674
I don't think this is a
good idea. Honestly.

766
01:06:20,808 --> 01:06:22,543
Yeah, it's fine.
It's fine. Holly.

767
01:06:22,676 --> 01:06:25,813
Just go the fuck inside.
I don't... All right. Fine.

768
01:06:26,881 --> 01:06:28,082
Jesus.

769
01:06:29,284 --> 01:06:30,784
Okay, okay, okay.

770
01:06:33,288 --> 01:06:34,655
How are you?

771
01:06:35,422 --> 01:06:38,993
My eyes are open now.

772
01:06:40,061 --> 01:06:43,031
I have been cursed.

773
01:06:43,463 --> 01:06:44,498
Okay, uh...

774
01:06:44,631 --> 01:06:46,500
Or somehow wrapped up
in a curse.

775
01:06:46,633 --> 01:06:48,368
I... I got it from my patient.

776
01:06:48,502 --> 01:06:52,140
She was cursed, and then when
she died, she... she transferred it to me.

777
01:06:52,273 --> 01:06:57,979
And now I'm being threatened
by this... this entity.

778
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:00,215
By an entity?
No, no.

779
01:07:00,347 --> 01:07:01,815
It... It's what killed Mustache.

780
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:05,320
It was at the party yesterday,
but you couldn't see it.

781
01:07:05,452 --> 01:07:07,989
Nobody else can see it,
except for me.

782
01:07:08,488 --> 01:07:09,423
Jesus Christ.

783
01:07:09,556 --> 01:07:10,624
No, look, Holly,

784
01:07:10,757 --> 01:07:12,726
I know it's so hard to believe,

785
01:07:12,861 --> 01:07:15,462
and it was difficult for me
to believe it at first either.

786
01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:17,131
But look... look at this. Look.

787
01:07:17,265 --> 01:07:20,701
Oh, my God. Rose. Why
the fuck do you have that?

788
01:07:20,835 --> 01:07:22,569
Because this has happened
to other people.

789
01:07:22,703 --> 01:07:23,972
And they're all dead.
Rose.

790
01:07:24,105 --> 01:07:25,572
And I...
Holly, I'm gonna be next!

791
01:07:25,706 --> 01:07:27,842
Rose, curses are not real.

792
01:07:27,976 --> 01:07:30,410
Okay? You are
having some sort of a...

793
01:07:31,913 --> 01:07:33,447
A breakdown.

794
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,516
What? No, no. Holly.

795
01:07:37,218 --> 01:07:38,353
You're not hearing me.

796
01:07:38,485 --> 01:07:41,256
You are not hearing me.
Rose.

797
01:07:41,388 --> 01:07:44,158
This is exactly
what happened to Mom.

798
01:07:49,463 --> 01:07:51,099
You sound just like her.

799
01:07:56,503 --> 01:07:58,505
How the fuck
would you know that?

800
01:07:59,040 --> 01:07:59,974
I'm sorry, what?

801
01:08:00,108 --> 01:08:01,808
You were never around
when Mom got bad.

802
01:08:01,943 --> 01:08:03,610
Where the fuck were you
when she died?

803
01:08:03,744 --> 01:08:06,214
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

804
01:08:06,347 --> 01:08:09,317
Okay? Because I was older, I
got the worst of Mom's insanity.

805
01:08:09,449 --> 01:08:10,885
I had to fucking
leave the house.

806
01:08:11,019 --> 01:08:13,988
That was the only way
I... I could survive.

807
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:17,491
And I'm... I'm sorry

808
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:22,629
that I left you alone and that
you had to be the one to find her.

809
01:08:22,763 --> 01:08:25,099
I know that
that fucked you up, and...

810
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,467
And I know that that's not fair.

811
01:08:27,601 --> 01:08:29,037
I wish I could do
something about it,

812
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:31,605
but, Rose, I have tried so
hard to move on with my life,

813
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:33,707
to leave all of that shit
behind me, okay?

814
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:35,944
You, it's like
you can't accept the fact

815
01:08:36,077 --> 01:08:38,413
that Mom lost her mind
and fucking killed herself.

816
01:08:38,545 --> 01:08:39,881
And you let it
define your entire life,

817
01:08:40,014 --> 01:08:41,815
and you punish me
because I don't want to.

818
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:44,618
Well, I'm sorry that I'm
actually trying to help people

819
01:08:44,751 --> 01:08:48,189
instead of being some fucking
stay-at-home PTA housewife,

820
01:08:48,323 --> 01:08:52,927
who lives in her own
self-centered, smug little bubble!

821
01:08:57,231 --> 01:08:59,733
Okay. I don't know
why I said that.

822
01:09:01,235 --> 01:09:04,872
You know what, I'm... I'm not
doing this. I'm not doing this with you.

823
01:09:05,006 --> 01:09:07,607
You've completely
traumatized Jackson, okay?

824
01:09:08,876 --> 01:09:11,578
I can't have you around
when you're like this.

825
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:24,158
Fuck.

826
01:09:25,559 --> 01:09:26,827
Fuck.

827
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Holly?

828
01:10:08,269 --> 01:10:11,439
Fuck! Fuck!

829
01:10:14,608 --> 01:10:16,944
Fuck!

830
01:10:17,544 --> 01:10:19,247
Motherfucker!

831
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,748
Joel?
Why didn't you tell me

832
01:11:28,883 --> 01:11:31,452
about your patient's
connection to the others?

833
01:11:31,586 --> 01:11:33,421
Wha... <i>After you
left, I kept digging.</i>

834
01:11:33,554 --> 01:11:35,089
These cases?

835
01:11:35,223 --> 01:11:36,924
This same pattern.
It goes back further.

836
01:11:37,058 --> 01:11:39,861
So far, I've found 20 cases
involving 19 suicide victims

837
01:11:39,994 --> 01:11:41,929
with a direct line
linking them all together.

838
01:11:42,063 --> 01:11:45,066
And the things these people
are doing to themselves, Rose.

839
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:46,334
<i>Holy shit.</i>

840
01:11:46,467 --> 01:11:49,971
Wait, you said, um, 20 cases,
but only 19 suicides.

841
01:11:50,104 --> 01:11:51,738
One of the cases
mixes up the pattern.

842
01:11:51,873 --> 01:11:53,574
Some accountant, Robert Talley.

843
01:11:53,707 --> 01:11:56,043
<i>His business partner commits
suicide right in front of him,</i>

844
01:11:56,177 --> 01:11:57,777
and four days later, Talley goes

845
01:11:57,912 --> 01:11:59,679
and fucking murders a woman
he's never met before,

846
01:11:59,813 --> 01:12:00,982
completely out of the blue.

847
01:12:01,115 --> 01:12:03,417
But get this, a week later,

848
01:12:03,551 --> 01:12:05,286
the key eyewitness to the murder

849
01:12:05,419 --> 01:12:07,355
also commits suicide.

850
01:12:07,488 --> 01:12:08,655
Pattern resumes.

851
01:12:08,788 --> 01:12:10,690
<i>So, he's alive?</i>
Yeah.

852
01:12:10,824 --> 01:12:12,393
He's sitting in holding
in Al to on a.

853
01:12:13,027 --> 01:12:15,062
Joel, I gotta talk to him.

854
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:43,591
I'm gonna need you
to say something.

855
01:12:43,723 --> 01:12:45,326
Yeah, I... I will.

856
01:12:45,459 --> 01:12:47,128
Just... Just...

857
01:12:49,096 --> 01:12:50,498
Give me a second.
I mean, Jesus...

858
01:12:50,631 --> 01:12:53,034
I thought you were gonna say
this was some kind of, like,

859
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:55,536
crazy suicide cult,
or blackmail scheme.

860
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:58,805
I mean, this? This is...
This? This is... Hey, Joel.

861
01:13:00,807 --> 01:13:01,943
Okay.

862
01:13:02,076 --> 01:13:04,378
Let's just put aside
the possibility

863
01:13:04,512 --> 01:13:05,745
that some sort of evil,

864
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,814
extraordinary force
could even exist.

865
01:13:08,815 --> 01:13:09,884
What you're saying

866
01:13:10,017 --> 01:13:12,220
is that this thing
is jumping around

867
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:13,321
from person to person,

868
01:13:13,454 --> 01:13:15,890
and it is causing them
to kill themselves?

869
01:13:16,023 --> 01:13:18,359
Okay,
but maybe it's not suicide.

870
01:13:18,492 --> 01:13:19,627
What do you mean?

871
01:13:19,759 --> 01:13:21,996
Okay. So, my patient,
she was terrified,

872
01:13:22,129 --> 01:13:23,598
but she was not suicidal.

873
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:27,001
And then at... at the end,
everything about her changed.

874
01:13:27,134 --> 01:13:32,940
It was like the person I had
been talking to was gone.

875
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:38,179
And something else
had taken over.

876
01:13:41,215 --> 01:13:43,684
So, it's kind of like the guy...

877
01:13:43,817 --> 01:13:45,586
Yes... on the security
camera footage?

878
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,622
Yes. Yes. Exactly like that.

879
01:13:47,754 --> 01:13:50,757
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

880
01:13:56,763 --> 01:13:59,133
In the cases that you found,
um...

881
01:14:00,901 --> 01:14:04,905
how long was it
between each victim's death?

882
01:14:08,909 --> 01:14:11,145
None of them survived
longer than a week.

883
01:14:14,415 --> 01:14:18,419
Some of them didn't even
make it past four days.

884
01:14:24,492 --> 01:14:25,960
Today was my fourth day.

885
01:14:27,728 --> 01:14:29,063
Hey.

886
01:14:30,131 --> 01:14:31,532
Whatever happened
to those people,

887
01:14:31,666 --> 01:14:33,534
it's not gonna happen to you.

888
01:14:36,404 --> 01:14:37,505
I promise.

889
01:14:58,225 --> 01:15:00,094
<i>Transfer guard to gate three.</i>

890
01:15:00,227 --> 01:15:02,029
<i>Transfer guard to gate three.</i>

891
01:15:02,163 --> 01:15:03,230
Thank you.

892
01:15:03,364 --> 01:15:04,732
Give them a buzz through.

893
01:15:04,865 --> 01:15:07,168
They're clear.

894
01:15:07,935 --> 01:15:09,403
I owe you one for this, Doug.

895
01:15:09,537 --> 01:15:12,440
You're just lucky
that he fired every lawyer

896
01:15:12,573 --> 01:15:13,674
he was assigned.

897
01:15:13,808 --> 01:15:15,676
You do know
what this guy did, right?

898
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:18,079
Well, Dr. Cotter's building
a psychological profile

899
01:15:18,212 --> 01:15:19,647
on a similar case for us.

900
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:22,817
Oh. Well, Talley's
a whole box of fruit loops.

901
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:24,318
So, good luck.

902
01:15:24,452 --> 01:15:26,354
Look, you only got
ten minutes with him, okay?

903
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:28,723
It's the best I could do
without a court order.

904
01:15:28,856 --> 01:15:30,591
Well, I appreciate it.

905
01:16:05,626 --> 01:16:08,362
Mr. Talley, my name
is Dr. Rose Cotter,

906
01:16:08,496 --> 01:16:12,133
and, um, I was hoping
you'd be willing to

907
01:16:12,266 --> 01:16:14,201
answer some questions about...

908
01:16:14,335 --> 01:16:16,604
I'm done answering questions.
I confessed.

909
01:16:16,737 --> 01:16:20,007
I actually don't care about
what you were accused of.

910
01:16:20,141 --> 01:16:25,946
What I need to know is what you
experienced in the days leading up to it.

911
01:16:31,018 --> 01:16:32,920
I have a patient,

912
01:16:33,721 --> 01:16:35,256
a young woman.

913
01:16:36,957 --> 01:16:38,125
Four days ago,

914
01:16:38,259 --> 01:16:40,728
a man killed himself
right in front of her.

915
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:47,968
And ever since then,
she has been seeing something.

916
01:16:49,403 --> 01:16:52,239
Something that pretends
to be other people.

917
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:55,676
The man that
she saw kill himself,

918
01:16:55,810 --> 01:17:00,047
he claimed that he was seeing
the exact same thing.

919
01:17:00,181 --> 01:17:02,316
What the fuck
do you want from me, huh?

920
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:05,052
What is it?
I don't know.

921
01:17:06,086 --> 01:17:07,021
I don't know.

922
01:17:07,154 --> 01:17:08,422
Why is it that everybody else

923
01:17:08,556 --> 01:17:11,459
who's seen it is dead
and you're alive?

924
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:12,593
Why? Please.

925
01:17:12,726 --> 01:17:15,296
Mr. Talley, you
can help her. Okay?

926
01:17:15,763 --> 01:17:17,064
Please.

927
01:17:21,602 --> 01:17:22,703
Make the cop leave.

928
01:17:24,638 --> 01:17:26,173
Not gonna happen, pal.

929
01:17:26,307 --> 01:17:30,144
Make him leave,
and I'll tell you what I know.

930
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,715
Joel, please.

931
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:42,223
I'll be outside, all right?

932
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:58,305
I tried to research anything and
everything I could about this thing.

933
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:00,608
There's been other chains
in the past.

934
01:18:00,741 --> 01:18:03,744
Found one that was in Brazil
a few years ago.

935
01:18:06,447 --> 01:18:09,383
A man there escaped that chain

936
01:18:10,618 --> 01:18:14,221
by killing his neighbor and
passing it to his neighbor's wife.

937
01:18:15,022 --> 01:18:18,058
Your patient is going to die

938
01:18:18,192 --> 01:18:20,427
unless she kills someone.

939
01:18:20,561 --> 01:18:23,297
That's the only way
you can get rid of it.

940
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:25,399
The only way.

941
01:18:25,533 --> 01:18:28,003
She has to make sure there's
a witness for it to pass to,

942
01:18:28,135 --> 01:18:30,104
'cause this thing needs trauma
to spread.

943
01:18:30,237 --> 01:18:33,875
That's what gives it power.
Trauma.

944
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:36,510
Your patient has to
make it count.

945
01:18:36,644 --> 01:18:39,179
Tell her to use
some kind of weapon.

946
01:18:39,313 --> 01:18:41,315
Make the biggest mess she can...

947
01:18:41,448 --> 01:18:44,451
I can't kill someone!

948
01:18:45,786 --> 01:18:47,087
You?

949
01:18:47,788 --> 01:18:49,823
You have it?

950
01:18:51,225 --> 01:18:54,896
No, no, no.
Why the fuck did you come here?

951
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:56,530
You're not giving it back to me.

952
01:18:56,664 --> 01:18:58,799
Get out of here!
I'm sorry.

953
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:00,035
Get out of here!

954
01:19:00,167 --> 01:19:01,970
Get her away from me!

955
01:19:02,102 --> 01:19:04,572
Get her away from me!

956
01:19:04,705 --> 01:19:06,707
Get her away from me!

957
01:19:06,841 --> 01:19:08,542
Get her away from me!

958
01:19:15,816 --> 01:19:17,184
Hey.

959
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:19,720
Hey! Wait.

960
01:19:21,689 --> 01:19:23,657
What happened in there?
Nothing.

961
01:19:24,358 --> 01:19:25,759
What'd he say?

962
01:19:27,528 --> 01:19:28,662
Nothing.

963
01:19:29,263 --> 01:19:31,165
Nothing?

964
01:19:31,298 --> 01:19:33,400
He's out of his fucking mind,
Joel.

965
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:19,306
Ah, fuck.

966
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:15,763
What are you doing here?

967
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:17,899
I apologize
if you felt ambushed yesterday.

968
01:22:18,032 --> 01:22:19,533
That was the wrong approach.

969
01:22:19,666 --> 01:22:20,667
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

970
01:22:20,801 --> 01:22:22,971
I think you should go.
Rose.

971
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,907
We both know I have a
responsibility to notify the authorities

972
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,475
if you're a danger
to yourself or others.

973
01:22:28,609 --> 01:22:31,612
I need you to help convince me
you're not a danger.

974
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:46,928
Trevor mentioned there
had been talk of ghosts.

975
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:50,397
I never used the word
"ghosts."

976
01:22:51,732 --> 01:22:54,601
Evil beings, then.
Paranormal.

977
01:22:56,703 --> 01:23:01,242
I admitted to him that I was seeing
things, the same thing that I told you.

978
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:02,743
That's not happening anymore.
Okay?

979
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:06,513
It was stress and lack of sleep.

980
01:23:06,647 --> 01:23:09,616
I confided in him, and that
was obviously a mistake.

981
01:23:10,051 --> 01:23:11,485
But that's it.

982
01:23:11,618 --> 01:23:13,754
Okay? Are we good?

983
01:23:15,089 --> 01:23:17,091
How are you feeling today?

984
01:23:20,661 --> 01:23:22,096
Let me think, um...

985
01:23:22,997 --> 01:23:25,666
I'm pretty sure my fiancé
thinks I'm crazy.

986
01:23:27,035 --> 01:23:32,207
My sister has just
totally shut me out.

987
01:23:32,339 --> 01:23:33,908
And now

988
01:23:34,641 --> 01:23:36,177
my former therapist

989
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:39,513
is making unannounced
house calls

990
01:23:39,646 --> 01:23:41,916
to ensure that
I am not a danger.

991
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:45,920
So, other than that,
I'm really good.

992
01:23:55,629 --> 01:23:57,698
Should you get that?

993
01:24:02,937 --> 01:24:03,804
What?

994
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:06,506
<i>Rose, it's Madeline.</i>

995
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,543
<i>I've been trying your mobile
all morning.</i>

996
01:24:09,676 --> 01:24:12,679
<i>I'm very concerned about
how we left things yesterday.</i>

997
01:24:14,815 --> 01:24:18,119
<i>Rose? Are you there?</i>
No.

998
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:24,758
<i>Hello?</i>

999
01:24:25,492 --> 01:24:27,394
No.
<i>Rose?</i>

1000
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:29,763
No. No.

1001
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,399
Almost time, Rose.

1002
01:24:33,634 --> 01:24:35,602
What the fuck are you?

1003
01:24:39,107 --> 01:24:40,174
Ple... Please.

1004
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:45,113
No, no.

1005
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:47,882
No. No, no.

1006
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
No.

1007
01:26:05,259 --> 01:26:06,928
Hey, Dr. Cotter.

1008
01:26:07,061 --> 01:26:09,529
Aren't you supposed to be
on leave?

1009
01:26:09,663 --> 01:26:12,200
Just grabbing something
from my office.

1010
01:26:51,705 --> 01:26:53,875
Carl. Hi.

1011
01:26:57,744 --> 01:26:59,313
No. No.
It's okay.

1012
01:26:59,447 --> 01:27:00,848
No, no, no.

1013
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:02,716
It's okay.
Oh, God.

1014
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,852
No, no. Oh, no, no, no.

1015
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:07,288
Shh. Shh. Just calm down.
No! No, no!

1016
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:10,391
No! No!
Shh! Shut the fuck up.

1017
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:13,461
Just calm down, okay? Okay.

1018
01:27:13,593 --> 01:27:14,962
Rose.

1019
01:27:15,729 --> 01:27:17,031
What are you doing here?

1020
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:22,036
I don't know.

1021
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:26,074
Rose, you can't
be around patients.

1022
01:27:58,638 --> 01:28:00,341
Fuck! Rose!

1023
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:23,297
Fuck!

1024
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1025
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:40,148
Rose, what are you doing here?

1026
01:28:40,747 --> 01:28:42,183
Nothing.

1027
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:44,751
I don't... I don't know.

1028
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:47,588
I don't know why. I, uh...

1029
01:28:47,721 --> 01:28:50,258
Why don't we go inside together
and we can just talk?

1030
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:51,691
No! It's...

1031
01:28:51,825 --> 01:28:53,194
It's not safe.

1032
01:28:53,327 --> 01:28:55,463
Rose, I don't think you should
be alone right now.

1033
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:57,265
I need... I need to be alone.

1034
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:01,668
I need to be...
I need to be alone.

1035
01:29:03,803 --> 01:29:06,340
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I have to go.

1036
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Rose, I don't think you should
go anywhere, okay?
You just relax, I'm gonna make
a phone call, all right?
Rose. Rose, don't go anywhere.

1037
01:29:16,716 --> 01:29:17,985
Wait. Rose, please.

1038
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:20,021
Please don't go anywhere, okay?
Just hang...

1039
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:22,722
Rose. Rose, wait! Rose!

1040
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:51,385
- Joel.
- <i>Rose, I saw a police APB go out for you</i>

1041
01:29:51,519 --> 01:29:53,554
<i>that says you're dangerous.
What the fuck happened?</i>

1042
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:54,788
I know what I need to do.
<i>What?</i>

1043
01:29:54,922 --> 01:29:57,824
This thing, it needs
all of its victims

1044
01:29:57,959 --> 01:29:59,460
to pass it on
in order to survive,

1045
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:02,729
but if there's no one else
around, it has no way to pass.

1046
01:30:02,863 --> 01:30:04,131
As long as I'm alone,

1047
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:05,866
I can deprive it
of what it needs.

1048
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,435
<i>That doesn't make any sense.</i>

1049
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:09,803
<i>Your plan is just to
avoid people forever?</i>

1050
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:12,873
I am not gonna
keep running, okay?

1051
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:14,909
I've got to face it.

1052
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:17,378
<i>Okay, Rose, I'm coming to you.
Just tell me where...</i>

1053
01:33:47,588 --> 01:33:49,089
Rose.

1054
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:54,662
Baby...

1055
01:33:59,901 --> 01:34:02,136
Help me, please.

1056
01:34:05,907 --> 01:34:08,375
Mommy made a mistake.

1057
01:34:15,082 --> 01:34:16,750
Get the phone.

1058
01:34:17,953 --> 01:34:19,720
Call for help.

1059
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Rose!

1060
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:46,253
Rose.

1061
01:38:51,558 --> 01:38:53,027
It's okay, baby.

1062
01:38:53,827 --> 01:38:55,029
Come here.

1063
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:09,978
I am so sorry.

1064
01:39:12,446 --> 01:39:14,615
I... I haven't been a good mom.

1065
01:39:17,651 --> 01:39:22,589
I want to be.
I really try to be.

1066
01:39:22,723 --> 01:39:28,930
But sometimes
everything is just too much.

1067
01:39:30,098 --> 01:39:33,868
There is something terrible
inside of me.

1068
01:39:34,668 --> 01:39:38,505
I hate myself.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1069
01:39:39,073 --> 01:39:40,641
Are you ashamed of me?

1070
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:43,011
No.

1071
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:45,445
Then why did you let me die?

1072
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:51,485
Why didn't you save me?
It's not my fault.

1073
01:39:51,618 --> 01:39:54,388
You could have called for help.
Stop. Stop it.

1074
01:39:54,521 --> 01:39:56,157
But you didn't.
Stop it.

1075
01:39:56,291 --> 01:39:59,326
You wished that I would die.
Because I was afraid of you!

1076
01:39:59,459 --> 01:40:02,329
I was ten years old

1077
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:05,666
and you were a monster.

1078
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:13,074
And I know that it's not fair.
You... You needed help.

1079
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:16,343
But I couldn't.

1080
01:40:21,149 --> 01:40:23,350
And I have carried that guilt

1081
01:40:24,418 --> 01:40:27,721
for my entire life.

1082
01:40:30,925 --> 01:40:34,661
And I... I have to let it go.

1083
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,565
I ha... I have to let it go.

1084
01:40:45,306 --> 01:40:46,941
This is not real.

1085
01:40:47,842 --> 01:40:49,509
But Rose,

1086
01:40:49,643 --> 01:40:53,882
your mind makes it real.

1087
01:40:58,186 --> 01:40:59,586
What are you?

1088
01:41:00,654 --> 01:41:02,756
Why are you doing this to me?

1089
01:41:03,423 --> 01:41:05,093
Because your mind...

1090
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
...is so inviting.

1091
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

1092
01:41:59,047 --> 01:42:02,783
You can't escape
your mind, Rose.

1093
01:42:10,358 --> 01:42:11,458
It's...

1094
01:42:12,559 --> 01:42:15,595
It's my mind.

1095
01:42:22,769 --> 01:42:24,705
You can't escape it either.

1096
01:42:40,188 --> 01:42:41,990
Rose!

1097
01:42:44,859 --> 01:42:46,526
Rose!

1098
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:11,846
Holy shit.

1099
01:44:14,348 --> 01:44:15,749
Are you okay?

1100
01:44:15,883 --> 01:44:18,718
Can I just come in for a
sec? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1101
01:44:24,691 --> 01:44:26,194
Where have you been?

1102
01:44:30,664 --> 01:44:32,632
I'm sorry.

1103
01:44:34,102 --> 01:44:39,907
I'm sorry for dragging you into
my whole fucked-up mess.

1104
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:43,810
For most of my life,

1105
01:44:43,945 --> 01:44:50,218
I've been afraid of
letting people get too close,

1106
01:44:51,085 --> 01:44:53,687
because I was afraid of...

1107
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:59,060
what they might see
if they really looked.

1108
01:44:59,193 --> 01:45:04,332
And so I... I put walls up,
and I kept people at a distance.

1109
01:45:07,368 --> 01:45:08,768
And then...

1110
01:45:12,206 --> 01:45:13,508
I met you,

1111
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:17,478
and I could feel
those walls coming down.

1112
01:45:17,612 --> 01:45:20,780
And it scared the shit
out of me.

1113
01:45:23,584 --> 01:45:25,019
And so...

1114
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:32,792
I was selfish,
and that was not fair to you.

1115
01:45:34,395 --> 01:45:37,899
And I am so, so sorry.

1116
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:43,803
And I'm... I'm being selfish
again by even asking,

1117
01:45:43,938 --> 01:45:45,139
but do you think that...

1118
01:45:45,273 --> 01:45:48,376
That I could stay here
and just...

1119
01:45:50,677 --> 01:45:52,146
just sleep?

1120
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:56,750
Could you...

1121
01:45:58,186 --> 01:46:01,088
stay with me while I sleep?

1122
01:46:04,625 --> 01:46:05,725
Please.

1123
01:46:07,195 --> 01:46:09,430
Yeah, of course
I'll stay with you.

1124
01:46:17,572 --> 01:46:19,440
I'll stay with you forever.

1125
01:46:26,047 --> 01:46:27,148
No.

1126
01:46:34,255 --> 01:46:35,456
No.

1127
01:46:36,591 --> 01:46:37,959
No, no, no, no.

1128
01:46:38,792 --> 01:46:39,759
No, no.

1129
01:46:54,709 --> 01:46:55,943
No.

1130
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1131
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1132
01:47:20,201 --> 01:47:22,303
Rose.

1133
01:47:25,406 --> 01:47:28,042
No, no, no!

1134
01:47:35,716 --> 01:47:37,551
Rose!
No.

1135
01:47:37,685 --> 01:47:39,819
Rose, open the door!

1136
01:47:41,389 --> 01:47:44,558
Open the door.

1137
01:47:46,227 --> 01:47:47,495
Rose!

1138
01:47:57,638 --> 01:48:00,441
No!

1139
01:48:01,142 --> 01:48:04,145
No!
Fuck. Uh...

1140
01:48:04,278 --> 01:48:06,047
Hold on. I'm coming!

1141
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:08,815
No!

1142
01:48:11,952 --> 01:48:13,354
Rose!

1143
01:48:15,856 --> 01:48:18,426
No!

1144
01:48:59,967 --> 01:49:01,369
Rose.

1145
01:49:35,636 --> 01:49:36,971
Rose?

1146
01:49:43,043 --> 01:49:44,145
Rose?
