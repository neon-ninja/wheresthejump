1
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:33,928
Turn to your right.

2
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:44,006
That's it, sir, you're done.
Please follow the orange line.

3
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:08,922
We processed the film
we found in your bag.

4
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:11,049
They're not very pretty pictures.

5
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:13,802
Also, you left the camera in the hotel.

6
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:15,428
We processed that roll as well.

7
00:02:15,512 --> 00:02:19,140
- Can I see them?
- That's not a courtesy, Mr. Parrish,

8
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,684
this is evidence.

9
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:25,438
Do you guys have your own lab,
or do you have to send it out?

10
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,400
We have a lab.

11
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:35,698
Your legal aide should be here
within 30 minutes or so.

12
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:40,203
You don't have to talk to me until
she gets here if you don't want to.

13
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:42,372
You know that, Sy?

14
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:43,581
Good.

15
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:47,126
- Sy, can I ask you one question?
- Sure.

16
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,798
What was it about William Yorkin
that upset you so?

17
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:55,260
I mean, what did he do
to provoke all of this?

18
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:12,652
<i>Family photos depict smiling faces.</i>

19
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:20,785
<i>Births, weddings, holidays...</i>

20
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,412
Happy birthday!

21
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:24,789
<i>Children's birthday parties.</i>

22
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,378
<i>People take pictures
of the happy moments in their lives.</i>

23
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,632
<i>Someone looking through our photo album</i>

24
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:38,887
<i>would conclude that we had led
a joyous, leisurely existence</i>

25
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,140
<i>free of tragedy.</i>

26
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:49,230
<i>No one ever takes a photograph
of something they want to forget.</i>

27
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,032
We're gonna go.

28
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:02,619
- Sure you don't need my help?
- Yeah.

29
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:05,872
- Sorry, kiddo, I gotta work.
- Doesn't matter!

30
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:10,168
- I'll get takeout for dinner, okay?
- Okay.

31
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:11,711
- See you.
- See you.

32
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,762
- Jake, are you coming, or what?
- I'm coming!

33
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:28,186
- There's one.
- Okay.

34
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,952
Can I look at toys?

35
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,955
For a minute. I'm just dropping off
some film. Make sure you can see me.

36
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,039
Okay.

37
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:51,376
- Hey, Mrs. Yorkin.
- Hey, Yoshi, how are you?

38
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:54,671
- How have you been?
- We're doing good, thanks.

39
00:04:57,674 --> 00:04:59,550
- Got three rolls today.
- Okay.

40
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,220
- Can I get the address?
- It's...

41
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,222
326 Serrano Terrace, Yoshi.

42
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:09,227
I'll take care of Mrs. Yorkin.
What have we got today?

43
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,522
Two rolls, and I think I've got one
in here as well.

44
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:15,608
Can I have two prints of each, please?

45
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,695
Leica Minilux.

46
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,196
That's a very nice camera.

47
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,074
Really? Will's trying
to get me to go digital...

48
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,743
Don't do that. I'd be out of a job.

49
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,752
- You have one shot left.
- That's okay.

50
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,879
- It's a shame to waste it.
- It's fine.

51
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,674
No, please, I look horrible.

52
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:55,106
- How's Jake doing?
- He's great.

53
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,067
He just had a birthday, and...

54
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:00,361
How old is he, nine?

55
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,780
- That's right, he just turned nine.
- Nine.

56
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,828
There we go. Got a winner.

57
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:12,457
Thanks.

58
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,544
- When do you need these by?
- Can I have them today?

59
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,339
We close at 7:00 on Sundays.

60
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,968
Well, it's not important.
I can swing by tomorrow.

61
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:27,180
You're one of our best customers.

62
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,557
I'll have them for you
by the time we close.

63
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,643
- Thank you so much.
- No, problem.

64
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:35,354
- I'll do some shopping.
- See you in 40 minutes.

65
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:38,191
- Thanks, Sy. Bye.
- Bye.

66
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,611
Hey, Jake.

67
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,121
You sliced through an exposure
on that last roll.

68
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,625
Yes, Yoshi, I know. I made a mistake.

69
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:00,338
Mrs. Levitt has a problem,
offer her a free roll of film.

70
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:02,340
All right.

71
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:14,435
<i>I've been doing P.O.S. mini-lab
work for over 20 years now.</i>

72
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:19,023
<i>I consider it an important job.</i>

73
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,860
<i>When houses are on fire,</i>

74
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:26,864
<i>what's the first thing people save
after their pets and loved ones?</i>

75
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:30,618
<i>The family photos.</i>

76
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,631
<i>Some people think this
is a job for a clerk.</i>

77
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:49,011
<i>They actually believe that any idiot
attending a two-day seminar</i>

78
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:52,640
<i>can master the art of making
beautiful prints in less than an hour.</i>

79
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,605
<i>But of course, like most things,</i>

80
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,109
<i>there's far more to it than meets the eye.</i>

81
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:17,290
<i>I've seen the prints they fob off
on people at the Rexall or Fotek.</i>

82
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,503
<i>Milky, washed-out prints.</i>

83
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:24,172
<i>Too dark prints.</i>

84
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:30,928
<i>There's no sense of reverence for
the service they're providing people.</i>

85
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,934
<i>I process these photos
as if they were my own.</i>

86
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,570
I see someone had quite a birthday party.

87
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:50,281
I did them 5-by-7 for you.

88
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,283
I wanted them 4-by-6.

89
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:58,206
The larger ones are better.
I didn't charge you extra for them.

90
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:00,541
It's okay, I guess.

91
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,795
- How much do I owe you?
- $30.06. But let's call it an even 30.

92
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:06,505
All right, thanks.

93
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:13,596
- We have a gift for birthday boys.
- Really?

94
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:18,142
That's right.
Birthday boys get a free camera.

95
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,311
Jake, what do you say?

96
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:23,147
Thanks.

97
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,691
You're welcome, buddy.

98
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:28,110
We're taking Jake to Six Flags, so...

99
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:32,406
- I'll see you very soon.
- See you.

100
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:34,992
- Come on, Jake.
- Bye.

101
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:36,077
See you, Jake.

102
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,754
- What a cool camera?
- Yeah.

103
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,308
Good night, A.J.

104
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,798
That's just great.

105
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,094
Look, this is a great shot.

106
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,138
- Nice truck.
- I remember that.

107
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,099
- You guys are so cute.
- This is a funny picture.

108
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:43,227
That is so sweet.
This one's going into the trash.

109
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:48,232
Oh, my God.
Look at your face, that's classic.

110
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,860
- I need that back.
- You're not getting it back.

111
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,320
- I'm serious.
- Don't give her it.

112
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:53,654
- Better give it to her.
- No.

113
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:54,905
She's serious. She's serious.

114
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,575
- Hey!
- Hey!

115
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,368
Told you.

116
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,747
How'd this one get in here?

117
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,999
- Oh, that's Sy.
- Sy?

118
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:08,586
- Sy the photo guy.
- Sy took it to finish off the roll.

119
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,465
Great. Now we have a picture
of Sy the photo guy.

120
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:16,260
All right, guys,
it's so past your bedtime, come on.

121
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:43,120
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, thanks, just the check's fine.

122
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,458
- What you got there, family photos?
- Yeah.

123
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,293
You mind if I take a look?

124
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,635
These are beautiful. That's a good shot.

125
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:00,638
These your relations?

126
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:05,935
- Yes. That's my little nephew, Jake.
- He's a handsome boy.

127
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:11,232
Isn't he? Yeah, I got him
a camera for his birthday.

128
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,569
- You must be his favorite uncle, then.
- Oh, I don't know.

129
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,656
Sure I can't get you no more coffee, then?

130
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,952
- Oh, no. I'm fine, thanks.
- Have a nice night, now.

131
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:25,788
You, too.

132
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,198
Mom?

133
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,368
What, pookie?

134
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,205
I feel bad for someone.

135
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,166
Somebody at school?

136
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,001
No.

137
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:14,462
What do you mean, you feel bad?

138
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,675
When someone seems sad,
they don't have any friends

139
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:24,930
and people make fun of them,
that makes me feel bad for them.

140
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,476
Who is sad and doesn't have any friends?

141
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,813
- Sy.
- Sy?

142
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:37,067
- The photo guy at the one-hour place?
- Yeah.

143
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,905
- Oh, Jake.
- I really feel bad for him.

144
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:43,574
But, Jake,

145
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,453
we don't know that Sy is sad.

146
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:54,043
We really don't know that much
about him, you know.

147
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:57,755
<i>I mean, he might even
have a lot of friends.</i>

148
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:02,384
<i>And he probably has a girlfriend
and a mommy and a daddy who love him.</i>

149
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,139
<i>I don't think he does.</i>

150
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:14,563
That is so sweet of you to think of
somebody else like that, you know.

151
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,360
Listen, Jake,

152
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,323
not everybody is as lucky as we are.

153
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,116
<i>You know?</i>

154
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:30,538
<i>But maybe if we send them good thoughts,</i>

155
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:34,500
<i>it'll make them feel better.</i>

156
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:40,923
So why don't we close our eyes
and send Sy some good thoughts?

157
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,467
- Okay.
- Okay? All right.

158
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,428
- Ready?
- Yeah.

159
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,331
There.

160
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,005
<i>I bet next time we see Sy,</i>

161
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,507
he won't seem so sad.

162
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,509
Okay.

163
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,930
- You have to go to sleep, pookie.
- Okay.

164
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,183
I love you.

165
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,064
- Good night.
- Good night.

166
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:12,348
There you go. Come on.

167
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:28,614
How do you think we pay
for all this? I'm just asking you.

168
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:32,451
You think a money fairy slips an
envelope under my pillow every month?

169
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,954
- What are you even talking about?
- All of this stuff.

170
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:39,833
The new Mercedes,
the matching washer and dryer,

171
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:43,003
the fucking Jil Sander blouse
you have on now. How?

172
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,010
I love you, Nin, I do.

173
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:53,681
But if you want our life to look
like something out of a magazine,

174
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:56,934
I'm sorry, I've gotta work
to make that happen.

175
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,687
Do you even believe
what you're saying?

176
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,942
This is not about things, Will.

177
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,112
And it's not about money.

178
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,031
You're neglectful.

179
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,451
- Do you understand that?
- What?

180
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,705
You're an emotionally neglectful husband.

181
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,958
And you're an emotionally
neglectful father.

182
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,336
- Got it now?
- That's fucking great. Neglectful?

183
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,214
You're not here, Will. You're not here.

184
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,633
You're never here.

185
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,683
I'm going to bed.

186
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:51,280
<i>If in your mind...</i>

187
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,326
Ban', what's wrong with you?

188
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,165
<i>Oh, my God! Someone's trying to kill me!</i>

189
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,209
<i>Oh, wait, it's for Bart.</i>

190
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,759
<i>Who'd wanna hurt me?
I'm this century's Dennis the Menace.</i>

191
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,678
<i>It's probably the person you least suspect.</i>

192
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:17,389
<i>That's good, Dad.</i>

193
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,623
<i>Monday is our busiest day.</i>

194
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,253
<i>People shoot most
of their pictures on weekends.</i>

195
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,922
<i>The store has several regular customers.</i>

196
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:18,510
<i>There's Mrs. Von Unwerth,
who only takes pictures of her cats.</i>

197
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:22,306
<i>I've never seen a picture
of a human being. Just cats.</i>

198
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,933
Two copies, please, Mr. Parrish.

199
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:29,980
<i>There's Mr. Siskind. Mr. Siskind
is an insurance claims adjuster.</i>

200
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,316
<i>He only brings in pictures of wrecked cars.</i>

201
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,152
The usual, Sy. I need these by 3:00.

202
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,448
<i>We get all the new parents, which
makes up a big part of our business.</i>

203
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,409
<i>New parents go photo-crazy.</i>

204
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,120
I don't know how many rolls I have here.

205
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:51,335
<i>Cindy, a nurse from a nearby
cosmetic-surgery clinic, is a regular.</i>

206
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:54,254
<i>We do all the before and after shots.</i>

207
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:55,839
Thanks, Sy.

208
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:02,512
<i>Then there's the amateur porn artists.</i>

209
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:06,308
<i>We have to report kiddie porn
and animal cruelty.</i>

210
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,852
<i>But anything else, no questions asked.</i>

211
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:12,356
<i>- How many prints do you need of these?
- Just one set is fine.</i>

212
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,615
- Sy, are you kidding me?
- What?

213
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,869
I've got three of these
fucking machines down today.

214
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,246
I've gotta be in Heber Springs by 3:00.

215
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,249
Larry, all I'm asking you to do is
look at these prints.

216
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,420
Plus .3? Sy, are you fucking kidding me?

217
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:39,049
Point three? Nobody cares
until the shift's in double digits.

218
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,218
It's blue, Larry.

219
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:44,054
Well, I'll bet Brandt
cares about a plus .3.

220
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:49,267
Are you fucking threatening me?

221
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:53,397
You're breaking my balls
over a plus-three blue shift?

222
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:55,232
Fucking asshole.

223
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:59,403
Next time you call me out here,
that thing better be belching fire.

224
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:04,324
That's a great attitude, Larry.
Thanks for your precision work!

225
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:54,082
What the hell you doing?

226
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,917
Excuse me?

227
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,712
What was the deal
with you and the Agfa guy?

228
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:03,216
I'm preserving a level of quality
for my customers.

229
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,384
Your customers.

230
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:08,597
He thinks that a plus .3 shift
to cyan is insignificant. It's massive.

231
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,684
Sy, let me try and explain
something to you one more time.

232
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,608
You need to look again
at your place on the food chain.

233
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:23,320
These aren't your customers,
they're Sav-Mart's.

234
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,906
If you haven't noticed,
this isn't Neiman Marcus.

235
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,993
People come here with their kids
for a good time

236
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:32,579
and to save on paper towels and socks.

237
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,040
If they wanted to see yelling,
they'd stay at home.

238
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:40,295
It was wrong to create a scene in front
of customers. It won't happen again.

239
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,515
Sy, don't you have
some vacation time saved up?

240
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,683
I guess I probably do.

241
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:56,436
You should take some time off,
go down to a Club Med.

242
00:23:57,229 --> 00:24:00,649
You know, relax, lay in the sun.
Enjoy life.

243
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,777
I'll think about that, Bill.

244
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:11,827
Your lunch break ended a half-hour ago.
What the hell you been doing in here?

245
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,385
I'm trying to figure out
if this will work with my Mac.

246
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,887
I'm sorry. This isn't my section.

247
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:37,686
- You're Will Yorkin.
- Yeah?

248
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:40,897
Sy Parrish. I'm the photo tech here.

249
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:42,357
I do all your family's pictures.

250
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:44,734
Oh, right. Sy the photo guy.

251
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,236
Right.

252
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:49,781
- Here you are in the flesh.
- Yeah.

253
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,292
It's just I don't see
you in here too often.

254
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:55,579
Nina usually does most of the shopping.

255
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:56,785
Can you help me with this?

256
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:01,209
This is computers. I do photo finishing.
It's not my section.

257
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:04,671
I'm in a rush and I had one question
I needed answered.

258
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:07,382
- No problem. I'll get someone.
- Thanks.

259
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,598
<i>Customer needs immediate assistance, aisle four.
Customer assistance, aisle four.</i>

260
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,434
- Someone will be here soon.
- Great.

261
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:18,518
You got it.

262
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,105
So is the rest of the family here?

263
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:25,817
Jake's around here somewhere.

264
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,997
You're a very lucky man, Mr. Yorkin.

265
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,126
I'm sorry?

266
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:46,922
You have a wonderful family.

267
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,841
And if you don't mind my saying so,
a very beautiful house, too.

268
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,638
Well, thank you, Sy. I appreciate that.

269
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:59,184
I really need to get this stuff
and get the hell out of here.

270
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:00,685
I understand.

271
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,897
- Thanks for all your help.
- Oh, it's okay.

272
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,775
- You say hello for me.
- I will do.

273
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:10,695
I gotta get back.
There'll be someone here in...

274
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,072
There you go.

275
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:15,992
Great. It doesn't say
if this will work for a Mac.

276
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:19,871
No. This is PC only. We have
some Mac-based stuff down here.

277
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:28,546
- Jake!
- Hi.

278
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,340
I was just talking to your dad.

279
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,510
- What do you have there?
- Evangelion.

280
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,514
Neon Genesis Evangelion.

281
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:41,017
What does he do?

282
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:46,523
He's a good guy, he can fly and he has
a silver sword that can kill bad guys.

283
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,192
- Really?
- Yeah. And he's 60 feet tall.

284
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,529
- You really want this, don't you?
- Yeah.

285
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:54,364
- Yeah, well...
- Jake.

286
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,993
- No more toys, we're leaving.
- Gotta go.

287
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,620
- I'll put this back for you.
- Thanks.

288
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:02,247
- See you.
- See you later.

289
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,835
I told you not to talk to strangers.

290
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:53,214
<i>I'm sure my customers
never think about it,</i>

291
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:58,094
<i>but these snapshots are their little
stands against the flow of time.</i>

292
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,101
<i>The shutter is clicked,</i>

293
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:06,728
<i>the flash goes off,</i>

294
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,857
<i>and they've stopped time,</i>

295
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,360
<i>if just for the blink of an eye.</i>

296
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:26,623
<i>And if these pictures have anything
to say to future generations,</i>

297
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:28,291
<i>it's this:</i>

298
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:31,294
<i>"I was here."</i>

299
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:34,631
<i>"I existed."</i>

300
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,551
<i>"I was young. I was happy"</i>

301
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:41,638
<i>"and someone cared enough
about me in this world"</i>

302
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,517
<i>"to take my picture."</i>

303
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:56,528
How much for this one?

304
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:12,168
<i>Most people don't take snapshots
of the little things:</i>

305
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,713
<i>The used Band-Aid,</i>

306
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,383
<i>the guy at the gas station,</i>

307
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,927
<i>the wasp on the Jell-O.</i>

308
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,933
<i>But these are the things that make up
the true picture of our lives.</i>

309
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:32,605
<i>People don't take pictures of these things.</i>

310
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:51,601
You really have to
tidy up your room, pal.

311
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:55,772
I'll bet your mother's told you
a thousand times.

312
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,355
Hey, Chaz.

313
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,151
It's a good game.

314
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,680
- Hi, Sy.
- You said you were going out today.

315
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:12,682
Uncle Sy.

316
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:17,186
Can you help me put this together?

317
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,206
<i>SY'. How many prints would you like?</i>

318
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,208
Just one set.

319
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:42,462
Maya, that's a very beautiful name.

320
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:43,546
Thank you.

321
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,888
- Have you picked up prints here before?
- Maybe once, a long time ago.

322
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:54,182
Your face looks very familiar.

323
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:56,851
You work around here?

324
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,978
Sort of near here.

325
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:03,149
- I've probably seen you at the mall.
- I'm in here pretty often.

326
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,987
We're backed up today. Is 6:00 okay?

327
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:11,115
I won't be able to pick them up
till tomorrow or the next day.

328
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,951
- See you then.
- Thanks.

329
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:24,170
Come on! A little hustle.

330
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:26,589
Here we go. Right there.

331
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,591
Come on.

332
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,095
Good shot. That's the
way to strike the ball.

333
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:36,099
Get in front of those, son.

334
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:40,311
Jake, visualize where you want
the ball to go and drill it.

335
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,901
Good one, Jake.

336
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:50,571
Jake, that's not good enough.
We have to work on that.

337
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:53,324
Pay attention, fellas. A little focus.

338
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:58,788
Drill it in there, Matt, come on!
Good shot.

339
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:06,295
Next practice, Thursday.
If you can't make it, tell Derrick.

340
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,425
- Hey, Jake.
- Hi.

341
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:12,051
Tobey, you forgot your sweatshirt.

342
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:15,430
On my way home, I saw you out there.
I thought I'd check it out.

343
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:18,474
- Jake. You all right?
- Yeah.

344
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,477
Is your mom picking you up?

345
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:24,605
No, I got my bike.

346
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:29,652
It's a great shot you made.
Your coach was a little rough.

347
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,405
He should be more supportive.

348
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:35,491
- Want me to have a word with him?
- That's okay.

349
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,493
- I will.
- No, thanks.

350
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:38,870
Okay.

351
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:45,001
When I was your age,
I wasn't very good at sports.

352
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:49,297
I was kind of a chubby kid.

353
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,382
Let's face it. I was fat.

354
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:54,010
I was sick all the time.

355
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,764
Kept coming down with mono and hepatitis.

356
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:01,434
Then I broke my collarbone
and had a weird cast

357
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:04,103
that kept my arm up like this all winter.

358
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,482
I wasn't exactly the most popular kid.

359
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,359
How'd you break your collarbone?

360
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:12,361
I fell out of a tree.

361
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,240
- How's your dad doing?
- Good.

362
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:20,203
- Does he come to see the games?
- Yeah, sometimes.

363
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:22,371
Does he come to any games?

364
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:27,168
He's really busy at work.
I don't know, he's busy all the time.

365
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:30,421
Sounds like an important guy.

366
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:33,382
I guess. He owns a company
and everything.

367
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,513
Probably wants you and your mom
to have nice things

368
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:42,517
like that cool bike
and those soccer shoes. Hold on.

369
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,232
Those things cost money.

370
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,150
He'd be here if he could.

371
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:52,235
I guess.

372
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:55,112
I got something for you.

373
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:07,542
Wanna guess what it is?

374
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:23,766
What's wrong? It's the one you wanted.

375
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:26,894
Mr. Parrish, I can't take this.

376
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,146
Sure you can, Jake.

377
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:31,148
My parents wouldn't let me.

378
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:36,070
I'd better be getting back home now.

379
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:39,574
- You sure?
- Yeah, thanks anyway, Mr. Parrish.

380
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:44,662
- See you around the store.
- Okay.

381
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,127
- Hey, Jake. The name's Sy.
- Okay, Sy.

382
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:38,257
Well, there's been, like,
some kind of shift.

383
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:40,593
I don't know.

384
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:43,346
A couple of weeks?

385
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:44,847
Maybe five weeks.

386
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:48,643
Six.

387
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,647
No, I know that, but...

388
00:37:56,734 --> 00:38:00,321
Yeah, but this feels different, you know?

389
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:06,869
Listen, Jan, I can't talk right now.
I'll call you back this afternoon.

390
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:12,583
Okay. I know. I love you, too. Bye.

391
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:19,966
- Hi, Sy.
- Hi, there.

392
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,804
I was at the Dairy Queen.
I saw you and thought I'd say hello.

393
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:30,393
- I'm just grabbing some shopping fuel.
- I never see you away from the store.

394
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:35,231
- You'd think we'd run into each other.
- Why, do you live around here?

395
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,358
I live downtown.

396
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:41,862
- Well, that's quite a drive.
- No, I'm used to it.

397
00:38:47,118 --> 00:38:50,413
- You have a nice boy there.
- Oh, Jake. Yeah.

398
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:56,252
A little sensitive, maybe. He likes you.

399
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:58,504
He calls you "Sy the photo guy."

400
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:01,507
I've known him since he was this big.

401
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:05,386
That's right. You've been doing
our pictures for a long time.

402
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,433
You know, I almost feel like "Uncle Sy."

403
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:17,690
Well, I've got some serious shopping to do.

404
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:19,066
Oh, sure.

405
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:24,363
Take care.

406
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,286
- Oh, my God.
- What?

407
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:36,208
It's so weird. I'm reading
that exact book right now.

408
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,210
You're kidding.

409
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:42,673
No, I can't believe that
you'd be reading that book.

410
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:46,844
He writes a lot about noticing
coincidence, doesn't he?

411
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:48,596
Yeah, he does.

412
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:50,639
That thing he says about fear...

413
00:39:56,812 --> 00:40:00,649
"The things we fear the most
have already happened to us."

414
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,990
I had no idea you were
such a deep thinker, Sy.

415
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:11,827
I wouldn't say that.

416
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:19,126
- Do you have any children, Sy?
- Me? No. No, I'm not married.

417
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:22,046
- No girlfriend?
- No.

418
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,719
I have a snapshot of my mother, though.

419
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:43,067
- She looks very nice.
- She's passed away.

420
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:48,030
Oh, well...

421
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:50,866
I'm sorry, Sy.

422
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:57,665
Gosh, you know, I have to go.

423
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:02,670
- It was really nice chatting with you.
- It was nice chatting with you.

424
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:08,676
I'll probably see you soon. We can't
go a day without taking a picture.

425
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:09,844
Lucky for us.

426
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:13,013
- Okay. Bye, Sy.
- Bye.

427
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:02,605
Sy Parrish, please see the manager.

428
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,192
Sy to the manager's office
immediately, please.

429
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:23,834
- What's with the getup?
- It's Wednesday. I was doing the SRS.

430
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:28,631
There's been some discrepancies
in the click count.

431
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:35,596
That's Yoshi. His math skills are weak.
I told you that when you moved him.

432
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,265
The discrepancies are
on logs you initialed.

433
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:40,476
- They are?
- Yeah.

434
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:45,522
I guess sometimes at the end
of the week, you get a little tired...

435
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:47,816
We're not talking
a few innocent math errors.

436
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,819
The net-clicks all zero out.
They always zero out.

437
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:55,407
The problem is the shut-down clicks
don't correspond.

438
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:59,161
They don't come close to matching
the amount of prints we've sold.

439
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:03,082
Then it's probably the reorder counter.

440
00:43:03,207 --> 00:43:06,418
- Well, I asked Larry about that.
- What did he say?

441
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,923
He looked at the counter
and said that it checked out.

442
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,093
Also, in 14 years of servicing,

443
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:16,553
he's never seen a faulty
counter on an Agfa.

444
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:18,013
Really?

445
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:22,142
The question is, where did all those
unaccounted-for prints go?

446
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,020
What's the discrepancy, Bill?

447
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:27,773
We're talking hundreds of prints, Sy.

448
00:43:30,192 --> 00:43:31,318
That's not possible, Bill.

449
00:43:31,402 --> 00:43:34,154
I've done the math.
The P.O.'s confirm it, too.

450
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:36,615
I don't know anything about it.

451
00:43:36,824 --> 00:43:38,534
Well, I think you do, Sy.

452
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:42,663
Well, I don't, Bill.

453
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:46,166
Look, Sy, I've got a family.

454
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,045
I'm not losing my job over this.

455
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:56,885
I'm letting you go.

456
00:43:57,136 --> 00:43:58,178
No.

457
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:11,358
These discrepancies would be enough,
but you're spacing out,

458
00:44:11,442 --> 00:44:14,653
taking 90-minute breaks, creating scenes,

459
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:18,157
- giving away free merchandise.
- What?

460
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,744
Free disposable cameras
to customers on their birthday?

461
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:24,455
Sure as shit isn't company policy.

462
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:26,999
- You can't do this.
- It's done.

463
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:31,670
I talked to Sims at district. Finish out
the week and clear out your locker.

464
00:44:32,421 --> 00:44:34,590
If you do something like
fuck up the prints...

465
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:38,052
I haven't fucked up
a customer's prints in 11 years.

466
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:41,930
Just get back out there.

467
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:37,486
Hey, Sy.

468
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:40,614
Sy?

469
00:45:44,827 --> 00:45:47,037
Jake wanted to get
his birthday gift processed.

470
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,291
I'm sorry?

471
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:52,668
The camera?

472
00:45:56,505 --> 00:45:58,799
Right. The birthday gift.

473
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:07,307
- Number of sets?
- Just one is fine.

474
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:12,229
4-by-six, 5-by-7?

475
00:46:13,147 --> 00:46:15,107
The ones we usually get.

476
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,151
Standard.

477
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:21,113
Jake had a great time
with the camera, didn't you?

478
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:22,197
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

479
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:31,457
What was that address again?

480
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:35,419
It's 326 Serrano Terrace.

481
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:40,382
Sy, are you all right?

482
00:46:40,716 --> 00:46:41,758
I'm fine.

483
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,598
I'll have these for you tomorrow.

484
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:50,476
All right. Thanks, Sy.

485
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:52,019
Bye.

486
00:46:54,396 --> 00:46:55,397
Bye.

487
00:52:04,206 --> 00:52:06,500
I'm leaving early today, Yoshi.

488
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,210
Okay, Sy.

489
00:52:10,337 --> 00:52:13,507
I won't be coming back, Yoshi.
Bill let me go.

490
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:17,719
- You were fired?
- Yep.

491
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:20,430
- Really?
- Really.

492
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:28,563
I've really enjoyed
working with you, Yoshi.

493
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:31,191
Yeah, me, too, Sy.

494
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:34,820
Sy?

495
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:38,490
Sy, I just wanted to...

496
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:41,243
I guess I just wanted to say thank you.

497
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:43,620
For what?

498
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,248
For teaching me all this stuff.

499
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:48,917
You're welcome, Yoshi.

500
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:53,463
- Don't let the place go downhill, okay?
- I won't, Sy.

501
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:22,290
- Here they are.
- My pictures. Let me see.

502
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,201
Come on.

503
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:36,496
Come on.

504
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:45,046
What the hell's wrong with these people?

505
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:10,238
<i>The universe grows smaller every day.</i>

506
00:58:12,532 --> 00:58:16,369
<i>There must be security for all,
or no one is secure.</i>

507
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:21,749
<i>It is no concern of ours
how you run your own planet.</i>

508
00:58:22,709 --> 00:58:25,712
<i>But if you threaten to
extend your violence,</i>

509
00:58:26,796 --> 00:58:29,799
<i>this Earth of yours will be reduced
to a burned-out cinder.</i>

510
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:35,054
<i>Now, we do not pretend
to have achieved perfection.</i>

511
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:39,184
<i>But we do have a system, and it works.</i>

512
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:46,191
<i>Your choice is simple:
Join us and live in peace</i>

513
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:50,612
<i>or pursue your present course
and face obliteration.</i>

514
00:58:52,238 --> 00:58:54,282
<i>We shall be waiting for your answer.</i>

515
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:58,244
<i>The decision rests with you.</i>

516
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

517
01:00:45,977 --> 01:00:48,563
<i>According to
the Oxford English Dictionary,</i>

518
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:53,234
<i>the word "snapshot" was first used in 1808</i>

519
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:57,405
<i>by an English sportsman
by the name of Sir Andrew Hawker.</i>

520
01:00:57,613 --> 01:01:01,576
<i>He noted in his diary that almost
every bird he shot that day</i>

521
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:04,287
<i>was taken by snapshot,</i>

522
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:08,291
<i>meaning a hurried shot,
taken without deliberate aim.</i>

523
01:01:15,757 --> 01:01:19,761
<i>"Snapshot," then, was
originally a hunting term.</i>

524
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:51,876
Can I help you?

525
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:55,004
Just dropping off some film.
Just a customer.

526
01:01:55,797 --> 01:01:59,884
- I can still shop here, can't I?
- No, you can't still shop here.

527
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:01,177
I believe I can.

528
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:06,057
There's no law that says
I can't shop here because I was fired.

529
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:09,268
- I checked.
- There's other places to do photos.

530
01:02:09,352 --> 01:02:11,633
There's no reason to come here
other than to fuck with me.

531
01:02:13,064 --> 01:02:14,857
There's a good reason.

532
01:02:14,941 --> 01:02:18,403
I calibrated that machine personally.
It's the best mini-lab in the state.

533
01:02:22,323 --> 01:02:25,451
All right, Sy. Just this one time.

534
01:02:25,868 --> 01:02:29,956
But find another place to do your film.
I do not want you back in here.

535
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:31,999
Thanks, Bill.

536
01:03:16,377 --> 01:03:19,213
What is it? You can't just
leave your station unmanned.

537
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:24,051
- You need to see these, sir.
- Is it the anal sex fiend again?

538
01:04:02,423 --> 01:04:04,050
Motherfucker.

539
01:04:29,408 --> 01:04:32,036
What was Mr. Parrish's
demeanor when he came in?

540
01:04:32,495 --> 01:04:34,288
- Demeanor?
- Yeah.

541
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:38,626
How did he seem? Did he seem upset
or agitated in any way?

542
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:43,923
- I don't know, he seemed fine.
- Sy and I had words when he came in.

543
01:04:44,006 --> 01:04:47,802
I was surprised to see him,
and asked him what he was doing here.

544
01:04:50,638 --> 01:04:54,725
I suggested in strong language that
he bring his pictures somewhere else.

545
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,853
I need Xerox copies of this.

546
01:04:57,937 --> 01:05:00,731
- Can you show me where I get that done?
- Yeah.

547
01:05:00,815 --> 01:05:04,026
Mr. Owens, why don't you grab a seat
and try to calm down?

548
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,995
Your wife and child,
they're somewhere safe now?

549
01:05:15,663 --> 01:05:19,041
They're at my mother's.
I'm sorry. I'm a little upset.

550
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:22,545
No, no, no, no. I understand.
It's understandable.

551
01:05:24,171 --> 01:05:25,715
So how did he take his being fired?

552
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:30,720
I've fired a lot of people.
People get upset when they get fired.

553
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:32,847
He got pretty upset.

554
01:05:33,014 --> 01:05:37,310
He knew Mr. Araki would show
the photos to you and that you'd call us.

555
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:39,061
I think it's just a warning.

556
01:05:39,854 --> 01:05:42,940
- You have to take it seriously.
- We take it very seriously.

557
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:46,986
Your child's life was indirectly
threatened. We take no chances.

558
01:05:47,695 --> 01:05:49,405
There's an APB on him.

559
01:05:49,488 --> 01:05:52,450
Officers are en route to his home
with a search warrant.

560
01:05:52,533 --> 01:05:55,536
I have officers inside the store and out.

561
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:59,206
He may come back and pick up
his photos. He may not.

562
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,959
It's hard to say. I doubt he will.

563
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:06,047
Is that a good idea?
This place is wall-to-wall families.

564
01:06:06,756 --> 01:06:10,885
If he's stupid enough to come back,
he'll never make it inside the store.

565
01:06:11,552 --> 01:06:12,720
<i>Are you insane?</i>

566
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:16,057
Mr. Parrish? This is the police.

567
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:20,061
If you're in the apartment,
we need to know right now.

568
01:06:23,439 --> 01:06:24,732
Kill that TV.

569
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:30,029
Mr. Parrish!

570
01:06:36,327 --> 01:06:37,328
It's clear.

571
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:13,781
Officer Lyon. Double 6, 321.

572
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:15,866
<i>Go ahead, 321.</i>

573
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:19,495
I need to be patched through
to Van Der Zee in TMU. Right away.

574
01:07:20,121 --> 01:07:21,330
<i>321, that's a 10-4.</i>

575
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:26,127
Hey, Dan, take a look at this.

576
01:07:27,503 --> 01:07:28,671
What do you got?

577
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:34,218
Y-O-R-K-l-N.

578
01:07:35,344 --> 01:07:38,055
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
I don't find that name registered.</i>

579
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:42,810
Could you try a Maya Burson? B-U-R-S-O-N.

580
01:07:42,935 --> 01:07:45,396
<i>Let me check that for you, sir.</i>

581
01:07:45,479 --> 01:07:48,441
<i>- I'll ring that room for you now, sir.</i>
- Thank <i>you.</i>

582
01:07:50,317 --> 01:07:52,445
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello. This is room service.

583
01:07:53,654 --> 01:07:57,074
Sorry to bother you,
but we have your order ready.

584
01:07:57,158 --> 01:07:59,285
We need to know
if you'd like coffee with that.

585
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,829
<i>Will, did you want coffee?</i>

586
01:08:02,413 --> 01:08:04,165
<i>No, just the drinks.</i>

587
01:08:04,623 --> 01:08:06,751
And this is for room 217.

588
01:08:07,585 --> 01:08:11,338
<i>No, we're 511, right? We're 511.</i>

589
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:16,510
511. Oh, my gosh. I must be looking
at the wrong thing here.

590
01:08:16,594 --> 01:08:19,180
I'm sorry. We'll have
it up in just a minute.

591
01:08:20,055 --> 01:08:21,515
<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

592
01:08:22,892 --> 01:08:23,893
<i>Hotel operator.</i>

593
01:08:24,435 --> 01:08:26,645
- Room service, please.
- One moment, <i>please.</i>

594
01:08:28,564 --> 01:08:31,066
<i>Room service, this is Jon.
May I take your order?</i>

595
01:08:31,484 --> 01:08:33,569
Jon, this is Will Yorkin in 511.

596
01:08:34,195 --> 01:08:37,865
We've decided to go out for lunch.
I'd like to cancel our order.

597
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:40,034
<i>No problem. That was 511?</i>

598
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:42,411
Right. Thank you very much.

599
01:08:42,495 --> 01:08:43,576
<i>You're welcome, Mr. Yorkin.</i>

600
01:08:50,002 --> 01:08:52,213
- Yes?
- Nina Yorkin?

601
01:08:52,338 --> 01:08:54,882
- Yes.
- I'm Detective Van Der Zee

602
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:58,427
of the Threat Management Unit.
This is Detective Outerbridge.

603
01:08:58,511 --> 01:09:01,764
Threat Management? Is Jake all right?

604
01:09:01,889 --> 01:09:05,476
Everyone's fine. We actually need
to speak with your husband.

605
01:09:05,643 --> 01:09:09,063
Will's at work. What's this about?

606
01:09:09,897 --> 01:09:11,690
You mind if we come in for a minute?

607
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:14,610
No. Sure.

608
01:09:34,463 --> 01:09:36,465
- How can I help you, sir?
- Hi.

609
01:09:36,924 --> 01:09:39,969
I need a room. But not too high a floor.

610
01:09:41,762 --> 01:09:43,347
I'll check, sir.

611
01:09:45,516 --> 01:09:47,726
Yes, we can offer you 313.

612
01:09:49,645 --> 01:09:51,230
Anything on five?

613
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:53,649
I'll check, sir.

614
01:09:53,816 --> 01:09:55,025
<i>DUANE'. Will Yorkin's office.</i>

615
01:09:55,109 --> 01:09:57,486
It's Nina. I need to talk to Will.

616
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:00,698
<i>He's not in. I'll have him
return when he gets back.</i>

617
01:10:00,781 --> 01:10:04,285
Duane, get him on the phone
immediately. This is an emergency.

618
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:07,663
I'll try him now. I'll put you on hold.

619
01:10:07,955 --> 01:10:09,290
No, Duane...

620
01:10:11,876 --> 01:10:13,586
He's trying him right now.

621
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,708
Where's your son?

622
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,543
He's at his friend Eric's house.

623
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:57,171
It might be a good idea to have
Eric's mother drive him home.

624
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:00,758
Oh, my God.

625
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:40,297
- Mrs. Yorkin?
- Yes, Duane.

626
01:11:40,381 --> 01:11:44,635
<i>There was no answer, but I left him
a 911 page. He'll call you...</i>

627
01:11:44,718 --> 01:11:48,305
I know he's fucking Maya Burson.
I don't care about that now.

628
01:11:48,389 --> 01:11:50,724
I just need you to tell me where he is!

629
01:11:52,309 --> 01:11:53,727
I want a glass of water.

630
01:11:53,936 --> 01:11:55,562
Get it yourself.

631
01:12:00,943 --> 01:12:02,403
Room service.

632
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:07,616
Can you just leave it
outside the door, please?

633
01:12:08,951 --> 01:12:11,537
No, ma'am. I'm afraid
you have to sign for this.

634
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:14,581
Just a second.

635
01:12:32,266 --> 01:12:34,518
You. Get on the bed.

636
01:12:35,436 --> 01:12:37,521
Get on the goddamn bed!

637
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:41,275
- I've got plenty of cash in my pants...
- Shut up!

638
01:12:42,234 --> 01:12:44,945
Close the drapes. Close them!

639
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:48,782
Good.

640
01:12:50,451 --> 01:12:52,619
- Who said to do that?
- I closed the drapes.

641
01:12:52,703 --> 01:12:56,373
- To wrap a towel around yourself?
- No.

642
01:12:56,957 --> 01:12:59,001
Let me explain what's going on here.

643
01:12:59,084 --> 01:13:00,377
I tell you to do things.

644
01:13:00,461 --> 01:13:03,464
Then you do them exactly like I tell you.

645
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:07,676
I'm gonna tell you this one time
and one time only. You got the picture?

646
01:13:08,677 --> 01:13:09,678
Yeah.

647
01:13:10,304 --> 01:13:12,347
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

648
01:13:12,931 --> 01:13:14,975
Good. Now, get on the bed.

649
01:13:20,773 --> 01:13:21,774
No!

650
01:13:25,486 --> 01:13:26,487
Jesus.

651
01:13:27,946 --> 01:13:29,907
Am I talking to a brick wall?

652
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:31,617
Did I tell you to touch her?

653
01:13:32,618 --> 01:13:35,162
- No.
- I don't want you to touch her.

654
01:13:35,496 --> 01:13:38,165
If you touch her again,
I stab you in the heart.

655
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:47,800
<i>Proceed to Deerfield,
the Edgerton Hotel, Hunter Valley Road.</i>

656
01:13:47,883 --> 01:13:49,593
<i>TMU officers en route to scene.</i>

657
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:52,346
- Can you ring the room again?
<i>- I'll</i> try one more <i>time.</i>

658
01:13:54,681 --> 01:13:57,351
Now, missy. You have to take the robe off.

659
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:00,354
No.

660
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:05,651
I'm not asking, I'm telling.

661
01:14:08,904 --> 01:14:09,905
Off!

662
01:14:12,407 --> 01:14:13,992
She can do it!

663
01:14:19,706 --> 01:14:22,960
<i>The person in this room is not available.</i>

664
01:14:23,043 --> 01:14:24,211
<i>Please leave a message...</i>

665
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,889
What's this? What's this?

666
01:14:37,683 --> 01:14:39,393
Can't you stop your sniveling?

667
01:14:41,436 --> 01:14:43,897
This is supposed to look like fun.

668
01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:49,236
Okay.

669
01:14:50,863 --> 01:14:52,447
No touching!

670
01:14:53,365 --> 01:14:54,366
Smile.

671
01:14:55,117 --> 01:14:57,452
You have to look like
you're having fun, like it's a game.

672
01:15:00,789 --> 01:15:01,874
Come on!

673
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:05,210
Smile!

674
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:09,173
Wipe your nose. You look disgusting.

675
01:15:19,183 --> 01:15:21,768
Now. Put his thing in your mouth.

676
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:28,525
Don't do it!

677
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:33,155
Pretend. This is all pretend!

678
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,115
I'm doing it! Stop yelling at me!

679
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,993
- You're not doing it the right way. Like this!
- No!

680
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,001
No!

681
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:57,990
- Mr. Belmer?
- Yes.

682
01:16:58,573 --> 01:17:01,576
Detectives Van Der Zee and Outerbridge.
We spoke earlier.

683
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:03,996
Right. So, what is all this about?

684
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:06,707
- Any word from Miss Burson yet?
- No.

685
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,375
Have you seen this man?

686
01:17:11,044 --> 01:17:14,464
- He checked in about half an hour ago.
- What room?

687
01:17:16,133 --> 01:17:17,301
I put him in 519.

688
01:17:17,384 --> 01:17:19,761
I need a pass key. Now, please.

689
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:06,767
Mr. Parrish, this is the police.
Will you open the door?

690
01:18:49,017 --> 01:18:51,520
The retinal implant is
a microelectronic prosthesis

691
01:18:51,603 --> 01:18:55,273
that can reverse the effects
of retinal degeneration.

692
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:56,691
We owe a...

693
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:14,751
James.

694
01:19:19,756 --> 01:19:20,841
Let's find Yorkin.

695
01:19:49,035 --> 01:19:50,036
Check 511.

696
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,340
Bravo? Where is it? Where is it?

697
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:10,724
It's the rear kitchen access.

698
01:20:11,558 --> 01:20:13,435
It's in the back, rear kitchen access.

699
01:20:27,449 --> 01:20:28,909
Miss Burson?

700
01:20:43,882 --> 01:20:45,175
Police! Freeze!

701
01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:53,099
William Yorkin?

702
01:20:58,021 --> 01:20:59,064
Drop the bag!

703
01:21:01,691 --> 01:21:02,692
Do it!

704
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:10,408
Put your hands on top of your head.

705
01:21:16,039 --> 01:21:17,457
Miss Burson?

706
01:22:02,669 --> 01:22:04,254
I just took pictures.

707
01:22:04,337 --> 01:22:06,089
You have the right
to remain silent.

708
01:22:06,172 --> 01:22:08,842
If you give up the right
to remain silent, anything you...

709
01:22:10,218 --> 01:22:12,345
Outerbridge? We got him.

710
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:15,265
The attorney present
during questioning.

711
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:18,727
If you so desire and cannot afford one,
an attorney will be appointed...

712
01:22:34,826 --> 01:22:35,827
Dad!

713
01:24:19,973 --> 01:24:22,726
Are you married, detective?
You have any children?

714
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:27,605
- I'll be the one asking the questions.
- I know. Just one question.

715
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:31,693
Are you a family man?

716
01:24:31,985 --> 01:24:35,238
- That's none of your business.
- You're right. It isn't.

717
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:38,992
It is none of my business.
But I'm guessing by your answer and

718
01:24:39,075 --> 01:24:41,745
that ring on your finger that you are.

719
01:24:41,828 --> 01:24:43,913
And that makes you a very fortunate man.

720
01:24:45,498 --> 01:24:47,917
I can also tell by the
way you've treated me

721
01:24:48,001 --> 01:24:50,420
and the way you do your job,

722
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:53,923
you're a good man.
A good husband and father, a man

723
01:24:54,007 --> 01:24:56,009
who appreciates his good fortune.

724
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:02,015
You're not the type of father
who'd cheat on his wife,

725
01:25:03,016 --> 01:25:05,602
hurt his family, betray their trust.

726
01:25:13,902 --> 01:25:16,821
You would never neglect
and abuse your children.

727
01:25:20,033 --> 01:25:22,869
Make horrible demands of your children.

728
01:25:25,705 --> 01:25:27,582
You would never ask...

729
01:25:33,171 --> 01:25:36,299
You would never ask your children
to do things...

730
01:25:39,177 --> 01:25:42,514
Things that children shouldn't do.

731
01:25:43,765 --> 01:25:48,102
You would never take disgusting,
sick, degrading pictures

732
01:25:48,186 --> 01:25:51,272
of your children doing these things!

733
01:26:01,783 --> 01:26:04,953
You would never treat
your children like animals.

734
01:26:19,509 --> 01:26:22,053
Will Yorkin had it all,
and he threw it all away.

735
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:29,435
He is not a good father.

736
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:45,535
Well, I...

737
01:26:49,122 --> 01:26:51,291
I think I understand now, Sy.

738
01:26:53,334 --> 01:26:56,504
Thank you for answering
my questions so candidly.

739
01:26:56,796 --> 01:26:58,298
You're welcome.

740
01:27:01,593 --> 01:27:03,636
Can I see my pictures now?

741
01:27:09,309 --> 01:27:10,310
Sure, Sy.

742
01:27:12,478 --> 01:27:13,771
Thank you.
