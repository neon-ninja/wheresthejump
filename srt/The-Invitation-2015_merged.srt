1
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,879
Will.

2
00:01:04,092 --> 00:01:06,863
Will. Hey. I asked if you were okay.

3
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:08,788
Sorry.

4
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:15,171
You know, we don't have to do this.
We can just go home.

5
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:17,354
I'll be fine.

6
00:01:18,506 --> 00:01:20,910
God, this thing is so...

7
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,812
thick...

8
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:24,862
Official.

9
00:01:26,248 --> 00:01:27,884
Maybe they're overcompensating.

10
00:01:28,184 --> 00:01:31,921
It's kind of hard to call everybody up
out of the blue after two years.

11
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:35,592
- Nobody's seen her?
- I ran into her and David at a supermarket,

12
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:38,094
and a little bit after that,
I heard they disappeared.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
And they met in the grief group?
While we were still married.
Yeah, I guess you could have
put odds on our divorce.

14
00:01:45,702 --> 00:01:48,104
- No, people don't think like that.
- Yes, they do.

15
00:01:48,204 --> 00:01:51,055
- No, they don't.
- Yes, they...

16
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,426
Oh, my God.

17
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:58,381
- Jesus.
- What was that?

18
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:00,697
A coyote, I think.

19
00:02:04,953 --> 00:02:06,904
Just stay here.

20
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:15,212
Oh, man.

21
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,543
You should go back in the car.

22
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:09,148
Okay, okay.

23
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:15,739
Oh, my God.

24
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:56,246
Jesus.

25
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:46,542
This was your house?

26
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:49,193
A lot of money in Eden's family.

27
00:05:49,745 --> 00:05:51,762
Wasn't ever mine.

28
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,718
<i>Come on, Ty.</i>

29
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,322
<i>Dinner's ready.</i>

30
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:31,087
Hey, you're here.

31
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:34,891
Fucking A. I win, see? Hi!

32
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:38,928
- Was there a betting pool?
- For entertainment purposes only.

33
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:40,647
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

34
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:43,097
- I am Gina. We met at their...
- Yes.

35
00:06:43,197 --> 00:06:45,006
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

36
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:49,672
Kira, you look so fucking hot right now.
Will you bear a child for us, right now?

37
00:06:49,772 --> 00:06:51,570
- We're not kidding.
- And, you...

38
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,511
I see you've almost shed that dirty
dishrag look that's so concerning.

39
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:58,815
- What? I have a dirty dishrag look?
- Less so now.

40
00:06:58,915 --> 00:07:01,616
- It's just...
- What? Come on.

41
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:05,103
How are you?

42
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:08,258
- Is this Kira?
- That's me.

43
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:10,360
- Hi. I'm Claire.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

44
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,115
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Hey, Will.

45
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:15,598
I'm Ben. Remember me? We drove
a thriving business into the ground together.

46
00:07:15,698 --> 00:07:16,683
Never thrived.

47
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:19,619
It was thriving like a motherfucker
for three months, and you know it.

48
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:22,572
Hey, wait. Where's Choi?

49
00:07:22,672 --> 00:07:25,808
Late as usual, and I can't get
any reception up here either.

50
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:29,359
- Is Eden and...
- I'm here.

51
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:42,931
Let me look at you, Will.

52
00:07:45,543 --> 00:07:48,164
- I missed you.
- Me too.

53
00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:51,100
House doesn't look
very different, does it?

54
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,569
No, not... not really.

55
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:56,945
Well, we're glad you're here.

56
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:03,480
You're a mess.

57
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,548
And you must be Kira.

58
00:08:06,648 --> 00:08:10,259
Hi. Thank you for having me.

59
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:15,358
Will, you remember David.

60
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,033
Of course. Sure.

61
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:24,606
Will, come here. Hey.

62
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:29,188
I'm so glad you're here.
I'm really glad, man.

63
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:31,324
Hey, how are you?

64
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:34,961
Oh, I'm brilliant. I mean,
we've got a lot to talk about,

65
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:37,263
so much to celebrate tonight.

66
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:39,507
- Kira.
- Yes.

67
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:43,642
Okay.

68
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:46,111
Beautiful.

69
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:48,808
- What can I get you to drink?
- No, I'm good.

70
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:51,911
I'd go with the wine.
It's an '85 Rothschild.

71
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:55,348
- Are you shitting me?
- Okay, what does that mean?

72
00:08:55,448 --> 00:09:01,059
- Oh, Will, you're adorable.
- It's, like, $8 million a bottle, cro-mag.

73
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:04,076
Well, this night is special.

74
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:08,628
We shouldn't save these things.
We shouldn't put off enjoying...

75
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:11,023
what we have.

76
00:09:11,123 --> 00:09:13,032
- You sure?
- I'm good.

77
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:14,767
Yes. Thank you.

78
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:17,270
- Well, since everybody's here...
- Except Choi.

79
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,073
- Oh, fucking Choi, man.
- All right.

80
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:23,376
Except Choi, but, you know, I guess
we'll just have to start without him.

81
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:31,551
First of all, welcome to our
little reunion of sorts.

82
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:34,621
You guys are all very special to Eden,

83
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:37,023
which means you're very special to me,

84
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:40,626
and we really missed you, and we love you.

85
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:44,246
You know, each and every one
of us is on a journey,

86
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:46,616
and we feel that it's important...

87
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,728
We want to open up the house again,

88
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:02,915
give it and us a new start, so...

89
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:06,269
Let's raise this ridiculously
expensive glass of wine

90
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:10,039
- to new beginnings.
- Yeah.

91
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:11,574
- To new beginnings.
- Cheers.

92
00:10:11,674 --> 00:10:13,109
<i>Salud.</i>

93
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,785
Hey! Save a glass for me.

94
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,058
This is Sadie. Sadie, meet my friends.

95
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:26,561
- Hey.
- Hi.

96
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:31,194
So...

97
00:10:31,294 --> 00:10:33,904
How do you guys know each other?

98
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:38,467
Just friends in common, I guess.

99
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:40,636
We met in Mexico.

100
00:10:40,736 --> 00:10:44,040
Sadie's staying here with us
and helping us out.

101
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,850
Yeah. It's fun. We have fun.

102
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,757
Hope you don't mind me crashing
the party. It's awesome.

103
00:10:56,184 --> 00:10:58,727
They've told me so much about you.

104
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:07,697
- We hit a coyote on the way up here.
- What?

105
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:11,934
It just came out of nowhere.
I mean, there was nothing we could do.

106
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:15,805
It was in horrible shape.
He had to kill it.

107
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:19,976
What? How did you not
tell us this, like, immediately?

108
00:11:20,076 --> 00:11:24,740
You killed it with, like, what?

109
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,317
- Tire iron.
- Oh, God. What?

110
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:31,287
I don't know how you did it, man.
That's pretty butch.

111
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:34,699
No, it was a good thing. That was mercy.

112
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:39,746
Would you mind
if I looked around for a little bit?

113
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:41,936
Of course not.

114
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:44,639
Thank you.

115
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,809
See you in a bit.

116
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,909
Can't believe it.
A tire iron requires a lot of...

117
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,501
No, you don't. No, you don't.

118
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:21,938
No, you don't. No. No. No!

119
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:23,840
Will.

120
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,142
Jesus.

121
00:12:26,242 --> 00:12:28,950
Sorry. You scared me.

122
00:12:29,978 --> 00:12:32,120
No harm done.

123
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:36,986
You're so handsome tonight.
You're shining.

124
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:39,022
And, Kira,

125
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:41,796
you're both really beautiful.

126
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:44,301
Thank you.

127
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:53,274
Could you help me
get those glasses, please?

128
00:12:57,772 --> 00:13:00,209
Bars on windows are new.

129
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:03,913
Well, I was here alone for a while.

130
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:07,751
It's security, safer.

131
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:12,894
It's nice.

132
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:16,759
Thank you. We got them in Mexico.

133
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:19,679
Is that where you've been
for the last two years?

134
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,953
Some of the time.

135
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:27,303
Did you worry about me?
Did you think about me?

136
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:29,844
Yeah.

137
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:32,313
I did.

138
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:37,746
Well, I'm fantastic.
I've never been better.

139
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:40,399
You don't have to worry about me anymore.

140
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:42,851
You don't find it hard
to be in this house again?

141
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:47,890
No, not at all. It doesn't have to be.
That's what's so incredible.

142
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,828
- You look different, Edie.
- I am different.

143
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:57,166
I'm free. All that useless pain...

144
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:59,240
it's gone.

145
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:05,881
It's something anyone can have, Will,
and I want you to have it, too.

146
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:09,745
Eden looks hot. I can say that, right?

147
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:12,204
We're all consenting adults.

148
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:17,269
- It's good to see you again, Ben.
- You, too.

149
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:20,480
It's been way too long.

150
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,005
I'm just here for the food.

151
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:26,601
What were you guys talking about?

152
00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:30,632
Not my business.

153
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:34,836
I was just telling Will
that pain is optional.

154
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:38,574
It is? Why didn't anyone
tell me that before now?

155
00:14:38,674 --> 00:14:42,811
I know. But it's actually really simple.

156
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:45,181
All those negative emotions,

157
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:49,752
grief, anger, depression,
is all just chemical reactions.

158
00:14:49,852 --> 00:14:52,888
It's entirely physical,
and it's completely changeable.

159
00:14:53,188 --> 00:14:55,924
Kind of sound like a pamphlet there, Eden.

160
00:14:56,024 --> 00:15:00,678
You can actually expel
those emotions from your body

161
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:04,099
and live the life you want to live.

162
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,908
So you're shitting out your pain?

163
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,140
I can see you're not interested.

164
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,197
I'm sorry, Eden.
It just sounds fucking crazy.

165
00:15:17,445 --> 00:15:19,821
Eden, what the fuck?

166
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:24,692
Until you stop making a joke out of
everything, you'll never learn a thing.

167
00:15:25,236 --> 00:15:28,079
That's why nobody cares what you think.

168
00:15:30,526 --> 00:15:33,003
Yeah. Okay.

169
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:36,071
She fucking gored me, man.

170
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:39,407
That was loud.

171
00:15:40,302 --> 00:15:42,371
- Oh, it's not...
- For the vegetarians.

172
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:45,978
- Has she been acting like this all night?
- Yeah. David, too.

173
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:49,945
Look, I'm all for whatever
you gotta do to get by,

174
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:54,183
especially you two, with what you went
through, but you didn't lose your mind.

175
00:15:55,183 --> 00:15:57,225
Oh, I didn't?

176
00:15:57,986 --> 00:16:00,194
Not like that.

177
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:06,921
How are you?

178
00:16:07,628 --> 00:16:09,704
I don't know.

179
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:12,034
I don't really know how to act.

180
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:16,072
Well, it's not like the good old days
anymore, you know.

181
00:16:16,372 --> 00:16:18,881
No. No, it isn't.

182
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:23,913
- Wait. Where's Amanda?
- Home with the kids.

183
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:26,754
- Yeah?
- Pissed.

184
00:16:27,515 --> 00:16:29,958
What? What's up?

185
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:32,694
Think we hate each other.

186
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:37,999
- That's not good.
- Yeah. I know.

187
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:42,374
But the sex is... it's so...

188
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:44,740
angry.

189
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:48,810
I can't get away from it, man.

190
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:54,217
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

191
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:58,614
- Hey, no one cares what I think?
- No.

192
00:16:58,814 --> 00:17:00,449
- Come on? Really?
- No.

193
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:03,919
Ben, have a glass of wine.

194
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:07,295
I've let it go already, and so should you.

195
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:12,667
- I'll always have a drink.
- See? It's gone already.

196
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,279
- We'll be here.
- Come. Sit with me.

197
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:23,644
Ask me a question.

198
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,281
Okay.

199
00:17:29,578 --> 00:17:33,543
- Seriously, ask me a question.
- Okay. Sorry.

200
00:17:33,643 --> 00:17:36,151
- Wait. You're up for tenure, aren't you?
- Yeah. I got it.

201
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:39,327
- Come on.
- A year ago.

202
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:41,807
Year ago? Really?

203
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:44,043
I had a party and everything.

204
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:46,395
I'm... sorry.

205
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,936
You don't have to be sorry.

206
00:17:49,063 --> 00:17:51,072
You're here now.

207
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,155
It's weird to be here, isn't it?

208
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:14,757
Maybe that's Choi, our hero.

209
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:17,159
Fucking Choi.

210
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:27,606
- I'm finally here.
- Yeah.

211
00:18:28,136 --> 00:18:29,944
Who's that?

212
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,588
Hey.

213
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:39,080
Everybody.

214
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,471
- It's you.
- Oh, darlin'.

215
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:46,455
- I can't believe you're really here.
- This is my friend Pruitt.

216
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:49,697
- Hey.
- Hey.

217
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:51,767
Evening.

218
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:56,838
- Eden.
- How are you?

219
00:19:01,535 --> 00:19:03,375
Hey. I'm Ben.

220
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,642
Nice to meet you. I'm gonna grab
a whiskey. Did you want anything?

221
00:19:06,742 --> 00:19:09,711
- Anything diet is fine, thanks.
- Okay.

222
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:13,579
Hey. I'm Tommy. Miguel, Kira, Gina.
Nice to meet you.

223
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:15,592
I have no idea.

224
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:17,753
I'm glad you're here,
but frankly where the hell is Choi?

225
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:19,310
Choi?

226
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,599
Is my asshole boyfriend.
Said he was gonna be early for once.

227
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,361
He didn't call you guys,
say he was gonna be late?

228
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:28,800
No. Come on. I thought
he was gonna come with you.

229
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,833
- Yeah, I...
- We haven't seen him.

230
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:33,802
All right, that's it. I'm gonna try again.

231
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:37,305
Do you guys have service up here?

232
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:39,575
- Sorry.
- Horrible.

233
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:42,144
And the bills fell through the cracks
while we were away.

234
00:19:42,244 --> 00:19:45,280
We have to get them up here and reconnect
the landline. I'm sorry, Gina.

235
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,583
Well, he usually calls at least once.

236
00:19:47,683 --> 00:19:51,259
You know what? Your best bet
is gonna be in the back actually.

237
00:19:51,786 --> 00:19:54,061
Good luck, though.

238
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:03,832
Is everything okay, Will?

239
00:20:03,932 --> 00:20:07,192
Yeah. Yeah, why didn't you leave
the key in the door, though?

240
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:11,440
There was a home invasion
up in the canyon about a month ago.

241
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,045
This couple got terrorized.

242
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:17,479
It was really sick.
Just kinda freaked us out.

243
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:21,316
- I didn't hear about it.
- Then I'm sure it never happened.

244
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,987
Yeah, come on, Will. Can't a man
put himself in lockdown if he wants?

245
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:27,095
This is America.

246
00:20:27,822 --> 00:20:30,265
Okay, what if there was a fire?

247
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:37,538
Okay.

248
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:45,112
There you go.

249
00:20:45,906 --> 00:20:50,246
Better? I just keep the house
a little differently. That's all.

250
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:52,337
It's my house.

251
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:59,171
Will, could you do me a favor
and go get some more firewood?

252
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:01,073
You know where we keep it.

253
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:18,413
Has he been like this a lot, so agitated?

254
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:22,717
Sometimes.

255
00:21:24,378 --> 00:21:26,815
Well, I'm glad he has you.

256
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:29,156
It comforts me.

257
00:21:30,184 --> 00:21:33,261
I know he wants the best for you, too.

258
00:21:33,688 --> 00:21:36,197
I'm glad you're here, Kira.

259
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:39,167
I think it's important.

260
00:21:40,595 --> 00:21:42,831
Can I ask you something?

261
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:45,123
How has he been handling things?

262
00:21:45,223 --> 00:21:47,742
He can be self-destructive.

263
00:21:50,238 --> 00:21:53,047
I think he's doing the best he can.

264
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,056
<i>You're it. You're it! Come on!</i>

265
00:23:52,193 --> 00:23:54,502
Come back to us when you're ready.

266
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:09,648
- <i>I'm telling you.</i>
- <i>Why are you doing it?</i>

267
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,981
Because it's... you're very dirty here.

268
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:15,522
- Am I?
- Yes.

269
00:24:16,518 --> 00:24:21,923
And it's attention to detail
that is incredibly important.

270
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:24,092
- It's my credo.
- It's your credo?

271
00:24:24,192 --> 00:24:27,799
It's a new...
I came up with it last night. Hey.

272
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,098
Why don't you go back to bed, okay?

273
00:24:30,498 --> 00:24:33,602
- We'll keep... we'll keep it down.
- Okay.

274
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:36,371
Okay. I love you.

275
00:24:36,671 --> 00:24:38,774
- Good night, baby.
- Good night.

276
00:24:38,874 --> 00:24:42,279
- I love you, too. Night.
- Good night, hon.

277
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:46,981
And that'll be the time he saw
his gross parents having sex.

278
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:49,425
We are gross.

279
00:24:53,687 --> 00:24:57,299
Do you think he needs a brother?

280
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,042
No! Oh, my...

281
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:11,607
- They're in a cult.
- No, no, stop. We're not in a cult.

282
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:13,675
I know plenty of people
who do the invitation.

283
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:14,609
- You do?
- Yeah.

284
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:17,813
- Eden, you guys really in this?
- We are.

285
00:25:17,913 --> 00:25:20,048
So that's why you were in Mexico?

286
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:23,018
Did you get all naked
down there in the jungle?

287
00:25:23,118 --> 00:25:24,992
Sometimes.

288
00:25:25,752 --> 00:25:27,895
Well, I did.

289
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:32,027
Yeah, you did. But, you know, it's just...

290
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:34,529
it's just a group of people
coming together.

291
00:25:34,629 --> 00:25:38,267
You know, they all have lost someone,
and then they help each other.

292
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:41,103
You know, it's really a science

293
00:25:41,203 --> 00:25:45,840
rather than, like, some weird
religious cult or anything.

294
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,677
You know, it's smart people
like... like us,

295
00:25:48,777 --> 00:25:52,113
here in L.A., New York,

296
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:54,349
thousands of people. You'd be surprised.

297
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:58,120
Yeah, my boss is into it.
It's like a new est or something, right?

298
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,255
Yeah, no...

299
00:26:00,555 --> 00:26:04,626
I think it's a little more grounded
than that, you know, more practical.

300
00:26:05,226 --> 00:26:08,406
And at the same time, it's very spiritual,
you know, however you define that.

301
00:26:08,506 --> 00:26:11,373
Seriously, what goes on down there?

302
00:26:11,473 --> 00:26:15,274
I mean, is it like
a self-help group thing or...

303
00:26:15,503 --> 00:26:17,339
Well...

304
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:21,443
since you asked, we have something
that we'd like to show you.

305
00:26:21,543 --> 00:26:25,413
- David.
- Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no.

306
00:26:25,513 --> 00:26:28,796
- Perfect. Just perfect.
- Now I understand why the doors are locked.

307
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:31,603
You're gonna convert us.
This is a conversion thing, right?

308
00:26:31,703 --> 00:26:33,939
Oh, my God. No, this is the real reason?

309
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:38,160
I know it sounds a little weird,
but it's actually, it's pretty amazing stuff.

310
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,068
Indulge us, okay.

311
00:26:40,168 --> 00:26:43,499
Is this some kind of a recruitment video?
I really don't want to...

312
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,169
- I do. Convert me. I am weak.
- Yeah, you are.

313
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:49,878
It's nothing like that. Promise.

314
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:53,480
All right, let's do this.

315
00:27:01,148 --> 00:27:04,052
<i>This is our home in Sonora, Mexico,</i>

316
00:27:04,152 --> 00:27:07,722
<i>and it is your home, too,
if you choose it to be.</i>

317
00:27:07,822 --> 00:27:11,660
<i>Our home and our family is open to anyone</i>

318
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,603
<i>with the desire to help themselves.</i>

319
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:20,669
<i>The human brain has
a remarkable ability to heal.</i>

320
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:26,874
<i>My life's work has been to discover
new ways to rewire, to rewrite</i>

321
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:30,712
<i>our experiences with trauma.</i>

322
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:34,989
<i>I mean, trauma has visited...</i>

323
00:27:35,482 --> 00:27:36,718
<i>all of us.</i>

324
00:27:36,818 --> 00:27:39,221
<i>We invite you to a conscious existence,</i>

325
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:43,485
<i>to a connected existence.</i>

326
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:47,865
<i>But we take this journey,
all journeys side by side.</i>

327
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:50,070
<i>You are not alone.</i>

328
00:27:51,632 --> 00:27:53,868
<i>Wherever you are...</i>

329
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:57,879
<i>we... we transcend.</i>

330
00:28:07,748 --> 00:28:10,418
<i>How do you feel, Annie?</i>

331
00:28:11,218 --> 00:28:14,262
<i>I feel loved.</i>

332
00:28:18,325 --> 00:28:20,361
<i>You are loved.</i>

333
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:22,831
<i>You are deeply loved.</i>

334
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:26,040
<i>Who are you going to see, dear?</i>

335
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,679
<i>My husband...</i>

336
00:28:33,907 --> 00:28:35,777
<i>James.</i>

337
00:28:35,877 --> 00:28:37,919
<i>My father.</i>

338
00:28:39,613 --> 00:28:41,588
<i>It's all right.</i>

339
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:46,488
<i>They will all be there.</i>

340
00:28:48,236 --> 00:28:52,300
- <i>I...</i>
- <i>Soon, Annie. Soon.</i>

341
00:28:55,997 --> 00:28:58,033
<i>Over soon.</i>

342
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:03,938
<i>All of the pain and all of the grief,
you renounced it, haven't you?</i>

343
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:06,813
<i>You've made a choice.</i>

344
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:12,920
<i>You're ready to go, aren't you, honey?</i>

345
00:29:19,087 --> 00:29:21,990
<i>Come. Come. Breathe in.</i>

346
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,999
<i>Breathe in. Breathe deeply.</i>

347
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,470
- <i>You feel her spirit?</i>
- <i>I can feel it.</i>

348
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:33,173
<i>I can feel it.</i>

349
00:29:54,688 --> 00:29:57,131
<i>She's with all of us now...</i>

350
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,835
<i>And your father...</i>

351
00:30:02,663 --> 00:30:06,501
<i>And your wife... and your son.</i>

352
00:30:07,401 --> 00:30:09,503
<i>Don't cry.</i>

353
00:30:09,603 --> 00:30:13,748
<i>There's no darkness, just reunion.</i>

354
00:30:15,842 --> 00:30:18,852
<i>Annie is safe now.</i>

355
00:30:34,094 --> 00:30:36,537
This is what it's about.

356
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:41,375
We did not just watch somebody die.

357
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,814
- That was real?
- Yes, it was.

358
00:30:47,007 --> 00:30:49,244
Why would anyone want to watch that?

359
00:30:49,744 --> 00:30:54,182
She just wanted to show everyone
that there's nothing to be afraid of.

360
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:58,152
That was the point. She was very sick.

361
00:30:58,252 --> 00:31:01,456
With what? She barely looked 30.

362
00:31:01,956 --> 00:31:03,688
Cancer.

363
00:31:04,158 --> 00:31:08,713
Look, I get it. If you gotta go
at 30, it's not a bad way,

364
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:12,370
- surrounded by people who love you.
- On video?

365
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,475
It's beautiful.

366
00:31:15,537 --> 00:31:17,572
It's a little grim.

367
00:31:17,672 --> 00:31:20,551
She looked at peace to me.
I'm not judging her.

368
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:24,012
- No, I know, babe.
- Yeah, no one's judging her.

369
00:31:24,112 --> 00:31:27,538
I just don't understand why you'd show
something like that at a dinner party, David.

370
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:31,002
You don't get it?

371
00:31:31,452 --> 00:31:34,999
I guess this is not really
being taken the way we meant it.

372
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:38,927
I mean, it is a pretty heavy thing
to drop on us, David.

373
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:42,363
But it's not heavy. For us, it's not.

374
00:31:42,563 --> 00:31:45,480
- No.
- It's okay. Not everybody gets it.

375
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,461
It's not about the fact that she died.
We all die.

376
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:53,291
- What's it about?
- It's about communion.

377
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:55,310
Right, like Eden said,

378
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:00,253
she's just trying to show you
that there's nothing to be afraid of.

379
00:32:02,215 --> 00:32:06,571
Look at me. My pain had turned me
into some walking cliché.

380
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:11,309
I was a coked-up, out-of-control
record producer, for God's sake.

381
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:14,145
I was a slave to my own grief...

382
00:32:14,895 --> 00:32:17,231
but not anymore.

383
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:19,967
Dr. Joseph freed me from that.

384
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:21,943
I just...

385
00:32:22,803 --> 00:32:25,473
He gave me back my center, you know?

386
00:32:25,573 --> 00:32:29,617
- I don't have to be afraid anymore.
- Amen, brother.

387
00:32:32,914 --> 00:32:36,250
You know, we've all been
through horrible things,

388
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:40,027
but those things don't have to define us.

389
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:45,877
- What happened to Eden and Will...
- No, don't. Don't! David, don't.

390
00:32:45,977 --> 00:32:48,852
Finding this saved my life.

391
00:32:49,629 --> 00:32:52,834
I almost died after.
I almost couldn't keep on living.

392
00:32:52,934 --> 00:32:55,035
You know that, Will.

393
00:32:55,135 --> 00:32:59,179
But look at me now. I'm great. I'm happy.

394
00:33:00,374 --> 00:33:02,977
I'm not angry anymore.

395
00:33:03,277 --> 00:33:07,054
And if anyone is gonna try
to take that away from me...

396
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,260
My God, look at the way
you're looking at me.

397
00:33:17,057 --> 00:33:19,027
If anyone is gonna try
to say that this isn't...

398
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:23,064
Edie, I... Edie...
it's just you don't think I know?

399
00:33:23,164 --> 00:33:25,003
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I know!

400
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,235
- Let's get a drink.
- It's just that easy for you?

401
00:33:27,335 --> 00:33:30,093
Come on. Come on. Let's get a drink.

402
00:33:38,245 --> 00:33:40,282
Yeah, we all are lost.

403
00:33:40,382 --> 00:33:43,156
We can agree on that, right?

404
00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:45,993
It's just...

405
00:33:48,855 --> 00:33:50,964
It's too big.

406
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:54,868
It's too big for any of us alone.

407
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,139
You got to...

408
00:34:05,206 --> 00:34:08,949
- That better be...
- No, I've got it. I've got it. I got it.

409
00:34:13,314 --> 00:34:14,616
David.

410
00:34:15,816 --> 00:34:17,324
Sorry.

411
00:34:18,085 --> 00:34:20,294
Excuse me for a second.

412
00:34:28,128 --> 00:34:29,830
Hi there.

413
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,599
- Hey.
- Hey.

414
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,868
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

415
00:34:33,968 --> 00:34:36,336
No, not you.

416
00:34:36,436 --> 00:34:39,206
I mean, I knew it was
gonna be heavy, but...

417
00:34:39,306 --> 00:34:43,210
I was just... why Choi and I were
supposed to be here together for you.

418
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,547
We have to make a better effort.
It's on us, and...

419
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:48,883
I was trying to give you space,

420
00:34:48,983 --> 00:34:53,789
and I don't know if that came across
like I was checked out. It's...

421
00:34:57,091 --> 00:34:59,633
Okay, hello. I don't...

422
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:04,766
- You haven't heard a word I said, have you?
- I'm sorry, Gina.

423
00:35:04,866 --> 00:35:08,836
Just a couple people
looking for a party... on foot.

424
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:12,880
- Good luck. They'll die of dehydration.
- Yeah.

425
00:35:17,077 --> 00:35:19,714
Anyway, we can talk later.

426
00:35:19,814 --> 00:35:23,451
I just... I wanted you to know that...

427
00:35:23,551 --> 00:35:25,820
I have been thinking about you.

428
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,188
- Yeah.
- All right?

429
00:35:27,288 --> 00:35:28,857
- I love you...
- I love you, too.

430
00:35:28,957 --> 00:35:32,332
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

431
00:35:33,593 --> 00:35:36,837
- I'm gonna get a refill.
- Get a... get a drink.

432
00:35:46,472 --> 00:35:49,476
I feel like you guys
have to come to my house...

433
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,846
Are you gonna come
and join us at some point?

434
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:23,183
Will?

435
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:27,254
Can you tell me what that is?

436
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,883
It is a pill, Will.

437
00:36:28,983 --> 00:36:31,223
I found a bunch of it
in Eden's bedroom unlabeled...

438
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:34,261
- Wait. What are you...
- Please just look at it.

439
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,160
- It's Phenobarbital, I think.
- Is that dangerous?

440
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,563
Anything is dangerous
if you take too much of it.

441
00:36:42,663 --> 00:36:45,500
It's a barbiturate. I mean,
it's old-school, but it's...

442
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,770
not unusual to find it if you're rifling
through somebody's medicine cabinet.

443
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:54,414
Hey, hey, break up your little clique.
Come talk to us.

444
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,445
Come on. Let's go.

445
00:36:58,345 --> 00:37:00,848
Apparently V.I.P. room is in the kitchen.

446
00:37:00,948 --> 00:37:04,819
Guys, guys, guys, join us, please.
Just opened another bottle.

447
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:07,455
- Oh, yes.
- Probably needs a little more air.

448
00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:09,657
I mean it, Miguel.
Just keep it between us.

449
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:11,192
Okay, Snoopy.

450
00:37:11,292 --> 00:37:13,361
- Oh, man.
- Can you give this one to Miguel?

451
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:15,096
- Yeah.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

452
00:37:15,196 --> 00:37:17,098
<i>De nada.</i>

453
00:37:17,198 --> 00:37:19,072
Smell that.

454
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:21,141
Okay.

455
00:37:22,102 --> 00:37:24,872
- <i>Salud.</i>
- <i>Salud.</i>

456
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:26,880
Will thinks you guys are on pills.

457
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,310
Figuratively.

458
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,947
- You think we're crazy?
- I never said that.

459
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:37,424
That's okay. I'm not offended.
A lot of people think we're crazy.

460
00:37:38,918 --> 00:37:42,262
But I doubt they're as happy as we are.

461
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:46,235
Where's the diet again?

462
00:37:50,964 --> 00:37:53,234
- Why?
- <i>No comprendo inglés.</i>

463
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:54,902
- Thank you.
- <i>De nada.</i>

464
00:37:55,002 --> 00:37:57,371
Don't you guys think
this is a little bit weird?

465
00:37:57,471 --> 00:38:01,781
Look, Will, there is no way that tonight
wasn't gonna feel a little strange...

466
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:04,678
Or sad.

467
00:38:04,778 --> 00:38:09,483
Look, this is just a long-overdue reunion
between old friends...

468
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:13,988
with a couple of totally
frickin' friend weirdoes.

469
00:38:14,088 --> 00:38:16,409
- They're a little Mansony.
- "Mansonian"?

470
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:19,177
- And that skinny girl...
- Look, I'm not kidding. Come on.

471
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:21,829
I got you. Look at me.

472
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:25,299
Yeah, they're a little weird,
but this is L.A. They're harmless.

473
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:30,037
Let's just get through this night, give them
a break. Let's steal some more of this wine.

474
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:32,674
Now, that is something
I can get behind. Come on.

475
00:38:32,774 --> 00:38:35,541
Hey, guys, listen! I...

476
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:41,367
I realize that some of you might have found
that video a little disturbing or off-putting,

477
00:38:41,847 --> 00:38:44,252
- and I apologize for that.
- It's cool.

478
00:38:44,352 --> 00:38:45,887
No, Gina, it's not.

479
00:38:45,987 --> 00:38:50,057
Last thing I want you guys to think is
that I'm trying to force my ideas on you.

480
00:38:50,157 --> 00:38:51,326
Welcome back.

481
00:38:51,426 --> 00:38:54,562
You know, it's just
I want you guys to know me.

482
00:38:54,662 --> 00:38:58,559
There's this game we used to play
in Mexico at the end of group,

483
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:00,868
and I think we should try it.

484
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:04,605
- What kind of game are we talking about?
- Like charades or something?

485
00:39:04,705 --> 00:39:07,809
It'll be fun, and it'll give you
a sense of what we learned, right?

486
00:39:07,909 --> 00:39:10,635
- I'm in. What is it?
- Okay.

487
00:39:10,735 --> 00:39:14,748
It's kind of like that game
we played in college, "I never."

488
00:39:14,848 --> 00:39:17,618
- I always lose that game.
- Oh, I never do.

489
00:39:17,718 --> 00:39:20,721
Except this time, it's "I want,"

490
00:39:20,821 --> 00:39:24,155
so we take turns, and everybody
gets to say what they want.

491
00:39:24,255 --> 00:39:28,397
- I want to hear what Gina did in college.
- You mean who she did.

492
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:31,596
But the point is to be honest.

493
00:39:31,696 --> 00:39:33,831
All right? To admit your desires.

494
00:39:33,931 --> 00:39:37,421
You know, because anything is possible
once you strip away

495
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:39,704
social constraints and embarrassment

496
00:39:39,804 --> 00:39:45,141
and those negative emotions that,
you know, the things that hold us down.

497
00:39:46,242 --> 00:39:49,880
So honesty, okay? That's what it's about.

498
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,289
Want to give it a shot?

499
00:39:53,116 --> 00:39:56,059
- I'll go first.
- Wonderful.

500
00:39:57,454 --> 00:39:59,282
Okay.

501
00:40:00,073 --> 00:40:02,369
I want...

502
00:40:03,293 --> 00:40:07,504
to tell you, Eden, and David...

503
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:12,857
Will and Kira and Gina...

504
00:40:12,957 --> 00:40:15,473
- Miguel...
- Pack a lunch.

505
00:40:15,573 --> 00:40:17,975
And Tommy... there are so many.

506
00:40:18,075 --> 00:40:22,947
Ben, Claire, Pruitt...

507
00:40:23,347 --> 00:40:26,723
I want to tell you all that I love you.

508
00:40:28,017 --> 00:40:31,978
I know I haven't known
some of you for very long, but...

509
00:40:32,078 --> 00:40:35,559
tonight I feel love.

510
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:37,467
I do.

511
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:42,666
And a lot of people don't say that.
They're afraid.

512
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:45,794
But... so...

513
00:40:45,894 --> 00:40:47,977
I love you.

514
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:55,346
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my.

515
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:57,988
Oh, my gosh.

516
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,054
This is...

517
00:41:04,688 --> 00:41:06,757
Hi there.

518
00:41:06,857 --> 00:41:08,794
You get it?

519
00:41:08,894 --> 00:41:10,535
All right.

520
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:14,455
I want...

521
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,569
some of that coke you used to do.

522
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:21,392
Done. I think I might have some more.

523
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:24,942
You keep it in the house?
You're the worst rehabber in the world.

524
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:28,810
- No, David, don't. I was kidding.
- No, you weren't.

525
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:31,388
That's okay. That's the point of the game.

526
00:41:32,982 --> 00:41:35,890
Okay. I wasn't kidding.

527
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,140
Bust that shit out.

528
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,693
- There you go.
- I like this game.

529
00:41:43,193 --> 00:41:46,102
I want to tell you about my wife Margaret.

530
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,835
We were married eight years...

531
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:53,576
would have been 15 next month.

532
00:41:54,104 --> 00:41:57,747
She was a painter, oils.

533
00:42:00,076 --> 00:42:03,548
First saw her work
at this artists retreat in Minneapolis.

534
00:42:04,348 --> 00:42:06,750
I was in love with her
before I even met her.

535
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,628
These...

536
00:42:09,228 --> 00:42:13,115
abstract, energetic landscapes...

537
00:42:15,091 --> 00:42:17,501
and then I saw her.

538
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:21,838
It was like I'd hit the jackpot.

539
00:42:23,032 --> 00:42:26,270
She was the most
generous spirit I'd ever seen,

540
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:30,347
and she was as bright and gorgeous as...

541
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,716
the morning.

542
00:42:35,278 --> 00:42:39,968
When you surprised her,
she had this laugh, this...

543
00:42:40,068 --> 00:42:45,589
joyous, guttural rumble that came
from way down deep inside.

544
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:48,532
You knew you'd done something good.

545
00:42:49,926 --> 00:42:53,570
She was all light, all light.

546
00:42:55,031 --> 00:43:00,246
During times like this,
nights like this night...

547
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:03,623
I think of her quite a bit.

548
00:43:03,723 --> 00:43:06,446
Did she... pass away?

549
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:10,587
Yes, she did.

550
00:43:11,013 --> 00:43:13,389
We had been drinking.

551
00:43:14,617 --> 00:43:16,954
I had been drinking.

552
00:43:17,254 --> 00:43:20,257
We had just come home from a dinner,
and we were in the kitchen.

553
00:43:20,357 --> 00:43:24,164
We'd fell into one of those arguments,
you know, one of those...

554
00:43:24,264 --> 00:43:27,530
stupid fights that last
your whole marriage.

555
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:30,206
It was about the dishes.

556
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,857
Somebody started yelling.

557
00:43:33,957 --> 00:43:36,345
I don't remember who.

558
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:41,451
I went to pour myself another drink.
She tried to stop me, and...

559
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:45,488
something just gave.

560
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:49,058
I turned and hit her as hard as I could.

561
00:43:50,653 --> 00:43:55,268
Her knees buckled. She hit her head.

562
00:44:00,713 --> 00:44:03,633
Think she was trying to get back up.

563
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:06,237
You know, she had her hand out...

564
00:44:06,337 --> 00:44:08,578
was staring at me.

565
00:44:09,372 --> 00:44:11,386
And then...

566
00:44:11,736 --> 00:44:15,435
she collapsed, and she was gone.

567
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:22,375
What the fuck?

568
00:44:24,153 --> 00:44:27,297
It was a terrible, terrible mistake.

569
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:32,396
It was seven years ago.
I went to prison. I paid that way...

570
00:44:32,496 --> 00:44:34,905
but I was still the same person.

571
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,025
Finally, by...

572
00:44:40,925 --> 00:44:43,673
accepting the invitation...

573
00:44:43,773 --> 00:44:46,344
And looking only ahead...

574
00:44:46,844 --> 00:44:49,547
destroying that horrible part of me

575
00:44:49,647 --> 00:44:52,388
that made that moment possible...

576
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:56,693
I'm cured.

577
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,663
And I miss her.

578
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:06,497
Not a day goes by I don't think of her.

579
00:45:07,597 --> 00:45:11,135
But I don't grieve,
and I don't feel guilty anymore.

580
00:45:11,235 --> 00:45:13,937
I've chosen to let that go.

581
00:45:14,037 --> 00:45:16,835
Those emotions are useless, because...

582
00:45:16,935 --> 00:45:22,009
I'm gonna be seeing her again
in a better place than this.

583
00:45:23,412 --> 00:45:26,450
That's what we believe. That's what
most people have believed for centuries.

584
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,092
I, for one, can't wait to get there.

585
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,098
But forgiveness doesn't have to wait.

586
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:40,758
I'm free to forgive myself,
and so are you.

587
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,774
It's a beautiful thing.

588
00:45:45,435 --> 00:45:47,643
It really is.

589
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:01,485
What's more honorable, facing
the truth or hiding it to be accepted?

590
00:46:01,585 --> 00:46:03,387
And people change.

591
00:46:03,487 --> 00:46:06,790
I don't know.
This... doesn't seem very honest.

592
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,794
It feels like you're selling us something.

593
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:14,864
- No, we aren't.
- I want...

594
00:46:14,964 --> 00:46:17,556
- Are we really gonna keep doing this?
- I want...

595
00:46:17,656 --> 00:46:21,143
- This better be good.
- I want to kiss Ben.

596
00:46:22,204 --> 00:46:24,348
I always have.

597
00:46:32,683 --> 00:46:35,119
Why the hell not? Bring it, sister.

598
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:36,153
Oh, my God.

599
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:40,130
- I want to kiss Ben.
- One per party.

600
00:46:42,024 --> 00:46:44,567
- Boom. No?
- No.

601
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,674
Yeah!

602
00:46:53,009 --> 00:46:54,972
Get it, girl.

603
00:46:55,072 --> 00:46:56,913
Go!

604
00:46:59,308 --> 00:47:01,277
Jeez.

605
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,980
I don't know if I approve that.

606
00:47:05,214 --> 00:47:07,424
And nobody tells Amanda.

607
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:11,422
- I want a blow job...
- Oh, you're ridiculous.

608
00:47:11,522 --> 00:47:14,530
- From somebody.
- Oh, I know.

609
00:47:15,426 --> 00:47:18,228
- What? I'm not joking.
- I have to go.

610
00:47:18,328 --> 00:47:20,865
Come on. We're just having fun.
It's all right.

611
00:47:20,965 --> 00:47:25,502
This is all making me
a little uncomfortable. I'm sorry.

612
00:47:25,602 --> 00:47:29,206
Come on. Have a seat. I'll get you a drink.
We'll do something else.

613
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:33,544
No, no, no. I don't want to spoil
anyone's fun. This just isn't my thing.

614
00:47:33,644 --> 00:47:37,114
- Claire, please.
- Just... just let her go, David.

615
00:47:37,614 --> 00:47:39,949
Why can't she just leave?

616
00:47:40,049 --> 00:47:44,121
Will, I just want her to stay
and have a good time...

617
00:47:44,421 --> 00:47:47,524
and Eden has planned this night for
a long time. We'll be very disappointed.

618
00:47:47,624 --> 00:47:50,666
Well, just let her do
what she wants, okay?

619
00:47:50,927 --> 00:47:53,202
I'm gonna leave.

620
00:47:54,864 --> 00:47:57,768
- Of course.
- Bye.

621
00:47:57,868 --> 00:47:59,970
I'm sorry if I've made you
feel uncomfortable.

622
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:02,772
It's... it's okay. I'm tired.

623
00:48:02,872 --> 00:48:06,543
Claire, why don't you
just stay a little longer?

624
00:48:06,643 --> 00:48:09,012
I'll see you again soon, okay?

625
00:48:09,112 --> 00:48:11,387
I'm really sorry.

626
00:48:13,383 --> 00:48:15,658
Okay, Claire.

627
00:48:16,786 --> 00:48:19,490
Eden, it's okay.

628
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:21,664
I know.

629
00:48:22,591 --> 00:48:26,969
- Do you want me to walk you to your car?
- It's, like, 40 feet, Will.

630
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,497
- Bye.
- Bye, Claire.

631
00:48:31,635 --> 00:48:34,438
- Are you in the Prius?
- Yeah.

632
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:37,413
I parked behind you.

633
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,556
Thank you, guys.

634
00:48:55,991 --> 00:48:58,395
Hey, Will, come over here, and talk to me.

635
00:48:58,495 --> 00:49:00,603
Just give me a sec.

636
00:49:26,532 --> 00:49:28,991
Careful on the right.

637
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,961
Okay.

638
00:49:31,161 --> 00:49:35,024
Straight out. You're all set.

639
00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:42,846
Oh, Claire.

640
00:49:47,343 --> 00:49:50,186
Will, come on.

641
00:49:51,514 --> 00:49:54,585
Can you and I talk alone for a minute?

642
00:49:54,685 --> 00:49:56,759
It's important.

643
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,857
Yeah. Yeah.

644
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:03,232
Come on.

645
00:50:05,761 --> 00:50:07,827
I'm very happy you're here.

646
00:50:07,927 --> 00:50:11,468
It's so important to Eden and me.

647
00:50:11,568 --> 00:50:14,471
I mean, we chose you
because you matter to us.

648
00:50:14,571 --> 00:50:17,680
- You chose me?
- To be here tonight.

649
00:50:18,674 --> 00:50:21,144
But I don't know, man.

650
00:50:21,244 --> 00:50:26,049
You've been acting so...
suspicious of our hospitality.

651
00:50:26,149 --> 00:50:27,985
Frankly, it upsets me a little.

652
00:50:28,085 --> 00:50:31,788
I lock the door,
and you have a fit about it.

653
00:50:31,888 --> 00:50:34,992
Just now, my friend wants to move his car,

654
00:50:35,092 --> 00:50:38,428
and you're standing by the window like
you're gonna catch him stealing something.

655
00:50:38,928 --> 00:50:41,671
You seem very distant, very...

656
00:50:42,064 --> 00:50:45,307
just off somehow.

657
00:50:47,269 --> 00:50:49,312
I'm sorry.

658
00:50:51,207 --> 00:50:54,231
Maybe I wasn't prepared
to be here tonight.

659
00:50:56,245 --> 00:50:59,182
Okay. Okay.

660
00:50:59,282 --> 00:51:01,752
I appreciate your honesty.

661
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:03,673
Look, I...

662
00:51:03,773 --> 00:51:07,174
I understand that you feel
like you have to be on the lookout.

663
00:51:07,724 --> 00:51:10,209
I know, because that's how I felt.

664
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:14,298
The world is unsafe and chaotic,
and, you know, it happened before.

665
00:51:14,398 --> 00:51:16,804
It can always happen again. David, please.

666
00:51:16,904 --> 00:51:20,237
I don't pretend to know
what you went through with your wife...

667
00:51:20,637 --> 00:51:23,913
and you don't know me. You can't.

668
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,284
- Hey.
- Hi.

669
00:51:34,384 --> 00:51:39,962
I tried to convince Claire to stay.
I felt bad about, my story scaring her.

670
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,466
She seemed to understand.

671
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:51,394
I swear to God, every day I get
an email, and it's just I'm going,

672
00:52:51,494 --> 00:52:54,397
"what is this? Is this, like,
gonna kill my hard drive?"

673
00:52:54,497 --> 00:52:57,467
And it's usually some stupid
fricking video of, like...

674
00:52:57,567 --> 00:52:59,403
How many cat videos has Claire sent you?

675
00:52:59,503 --> 00:53:03,473
- Claire has sent me cat videos so...
- Every day, it's a cat video.

676
00:53:03,573 --> 00:53:06,520
I mean, I got a cat video.
I got a penguin video.

677
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,257
- Penguins. Penguins are overrated.
- Overrated?

678
00:53:09,357 --> 00:53:12,448
- Yeah. Yeah. They are.
- Here we go...

679
00:54:06,969 --> 00:54:09,122
<i>You're it.</i>

680
00:54:38,201 --> 00:54:40,076
Kira.

681
00:54:42,338 --> 00:54:43,713
Kira.

682
00:54:44,674 --> 00:54:46,483
Kira.

683
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,091
So things aren't great with Kira?

684
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,219
What... why would you say that?

685
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:33,216
Just seems like that to me.

686
00:56:33,316 --> 00:56:35,825
Seems like she's real distant.

687
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:38,561
No.

688
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:41,196
No, she's great.

689
00:56:45,894 --> 00:56:49,275
- Should we go back inside?
- No. I'm gonna make a call.

690
00:56:52,067 --> 00:56:56,138
Oh, good luck. There's no service up here.

691
00:56:56,238 --> 00:56:58,647
No, it goes in and out.

692
00:56:59,608 --> 00:57:01,817
I could hang with you.

693
00:57:05,413 --> 00:57:08,491
- You could fuck me right here.
- What?

694
00:57:09,852 --> 00:57:12,661
Why should we deny ourselves ever?

695
00:57:13,322 --> 00:57:17,193
It's what it was like in Mexico.
Man, everyone was just going for it.

696
00:57:17,293 --> 00:57:19,301
It was awesome.

697
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:23,305
I think you need to go back inside.

698
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:25,869
You don't like me?

699
00:57:25,969 --> 00:57:28,076
I don't know you.

700
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,213
I could make you like me so much.

701
00:57:32,374 --> 00:57:34,817
I could make you beg me.

702
00:57:35,444 --> 00:57:38,394
Could do it without even touching you...

703
00:57:39,515 --> 00:57:41,990
just with my voice...

704
00:57:43,352 --> 00:57:46,528
- my breath.
- Sadie.

705
00:57:47,456 --> 00:57:49,798
You can hurt me if you want.

706
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,768
I don't want to hurt you.

707
00:57:57,032 --> 00:57:59,241
I don't believe you.

708
00:58:05,808 --> 00:58:08,151
Hey. What are you doing out here?

709
00:58:11,213 --> 00:58:13,103
I needed a break.

710
00:58:13,203 --> 00:58:16,353
Oh, really? From what?

711
00:58:17,253 --> 00:58:19,389
Tommy, there's something wrong here.

712
00:58:19,489 --> 00:58:22,958
- Will...
- Something bad is happening here.

713
00:58:23,058 --> 00:58:25,395
You're wrong. Look, and I know
what you're gonna say,

714
00:58:25,495 --> 00:58:29,565
but Claire left because that poor girl
is sexually awkward.

715
00:58:29,665 --> 00:58:35,574
Choi is the most unreliable Korean
in Los Angeles. He could be anywhere.

716
00:58:35,674 --> 00:58:37,946
And Eden...

717
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:41,717
I haven't seen her for two years.

718
00:58:42,895 --> 00:58:44,507
It's crazy.

719
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:50,292
But we're all trying to figure out
how to go on, you know.

720
00:58:50,702 --> 00:58:54,724
- This is how they do it.
- Something doesn't feel safe here.

721
00:58:54,824 --> 00:58:59,112
Of course it doesn't feel safe. Took a lot
of courage for you to come here tonight,

722
00:58:59,212 --> 00:59:02,287
but you're letting your mind
run away with things.

723
00:59:04,299 --> 00:59:06,108
Hey...

724
00:59:06,568 --> 00:59:08,777
I love you, Will.

725
00:59:10,539 --> 00:59:14,243
But you gotta stop acting so fucking weird.
It's freaking people out.

726
00:59:24,786 --> 00:59:27,095
You're safe, okay?

727
00:59:30,325 --> 00:59:32,268
I'll see you back inside.

728
01:00:00,688 --> 01:00:02,425
<i>Will, Choi. What's up?</i>

729
01:00:02,525 --> 01:00:05,495
<i>Listen, it's about 7:00,
and I'm pulling up to Eden's house.</i>

730
01:00:05,595 --> 01:00:09,298
<i>I forgot to pick up dessert like I said
I would, and I can't get ahold of Gina.</i>

731
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:11,234
<i>Could you get some on your way? I...</i>

732
01:00:11,334 --> 01:00:15,038
<i>Look, I'm early, dude.
I'm actually early, but honestly</i>

733
01:00:15,138 --> 01:00:18,274
<i>I don't want to go back down the hill
and look for a fucking patisserie.</i>

734
01:00:18,374 --> 01:00:22,040
<i>I hope you get this.
See you here in a few, I guess.</i>

735
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:25,053
<i>I'm goin' in. Okay, bye.</i>

736
01:00:53,008 --> 01:00:54,377
There he is.

737
01:00:54,477 --> 01:00:57,018
- See?
- Hey, buddy.

738
01:00:57,146 --> 01:00:59,850
- I want to play "I want." I want...
- No more blow jobs.

739
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:03,019
I like this game.
Was it obvious that I like the game?

740
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,817
- I have room. I could do it.
- He has room for everything.

741
01:01:05,917 --> 01:01:08,858
- We both enjoyed that game.
- We did.

742
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,728
I think this is a new game.

743
01:01:12,828 --> 01:01:15,870
- All right, I'm scared.
- This is the next game.

744
01:01:16,533 --> 01:01:19,769
Maybe this is one of those guess who...

745
01:01:20,369 --> 01:01:23,573
So pretty. So purty.

746
01:01:23,673 --> 01:01:26,209
- It is lovely.
- Stop it right now.

747
01:01:26,459 --> 01:01:30,313
What is going on here?

748
01:01:30,413 --> 01:01:32,898
- Happy birthday.
- What is this about?

749
01:01:32,998 --> 01:01:36,736
- It's not for another week.
- It's close enough.

750
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:40,524
Okay, please, please. But no singing.

751
01:01:40,624 --> 01:01:44,928
Please? Please? Please?
Thank you. It's wish time.

752
01:01:45,528 --> 01:01:49,078
- Make it good. Make it good.
- Yeah.

753
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:52,235
You attacked that one.

754
01:01:52,335 --> 01:01:54,671
- Bastard.
- Well done.

755
01:01:54,771 --> 01:01:56,940
- Where's Choi?
- Excuse me?

756
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:00,216
Where's Choi?
I mean, where the fuck is Choi?

757
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:02,846
- What are you talking about, Will?
- I got a message from him.

758
01:02:02,946 --> 01:02:06,015
He said he was here,
that he had gotten here at 7:00.

759
01:02:06,115 --> 01:02:08,351
- What?
- He said he was here.

760
01:02:08,751 --> 01:02:11,955
- Eden, is that true?
- I haven't seen Choi tonight.

761
01:02:12,455 --> 01:02:15,124
- Edie, where is he?
- Will, stop, please. Just...

762
01:02:15,224 --> 01:02:19,128
No. No. I just got a message from him.
He said he was here.

763
01:02:19,228 --> 01:02:22,349
- He made the call from right outside.
- We haven't seen him.

764
01:02:22,449 --> 01:02:24,934
Don't fucking lie to me. He called
from right outside your front door.

765
01:02:25,034 --> 01:02:28,314
David is not lying to you.
Choi never got here.

766
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:32,342
- Maybe he turned around, man.
- He might have forgotten something, Will.

767
01:02:32,442 --> 01:02:35,851
Yeah, why is everyone
acting so fucking polite?

768
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,083
- Where's Choi?
- Hey, Eden, what's going on?

769
01:02:40,183 --> 01:02:43,519
I have not seen Choi tonight,
Gina, I swear.

770
01:02:43,619 --> 01:02:45,888
Something isn't right here.

771
01:02:45,988 --> 01:02:49,158
There is something
very strange going on here,

772
01:02:49,258 --> 01:02:51,310
and no one is saying anything.

773
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:54,764
- What do you think is happening, Will?
- Hey, who are you?

774
01:02:55,464 --> 01:02:59,068
See, see, I don't get
why you two are here.

775
01:02:59,168 --> 01:03:02,138
- Hey, these are my guests.
- Yeah.

776
01:03:02,238 --> 01:03:03,759
Two years.

777
01:03:03,859 --> 01:03:07,276
We don't see you for two years,
and then all of a sudden,

778
01:03:07,376 --> 01:03:10,116
we get invited to this lavish dinner.

779
01:03:10,216 --> 01:03:14,367
You're all smiles, spewing out all
this jargon with these two in tow.

780
01:03:14,467 --> 01:03:18,694
Don't tell me that this is normal...
the invitation.

781
01:03:18,794 --> 01:03:20,724
- It helps people.
- Will, everybody's allowed...

782
01:03:20,824 --> 01:03:24,427
No, it's a fucking cult, Miguel!
It's a fucking cult!

783
01:03:24,527 --> 01:03:26,996
- Will, sit down!
- No! No, look at the video, okay?

784
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:30,166
It's not about communion. It's not
about family. It's about fucking denial.

785
01:03:30,266 --> 01:03:33,236
- You are out of line.
- All right, no, it's about denial.

786
01:03:33,336 --> 01:03:36,456
You know what it is?
It's a fucking brainwash.

787
01:03:37,006 --> 01:03:40,576
Our son died, Edie,
and you're trying to ignore it.

788
01:03:40,676 --> 01:03:45,248
It meant something when he died,
and don't you try to erase that.

789
01:03:45,348 --> 01:03:49,751
Ty was real. It was rea... it is real.

790
01:03:49,851 --> 01:03:53,328
Please, please, Edie.

791
01:04:00,161 --> 01:04:03,436
- Where's Choi?
- Will, she said she doesn't know.

792
01:04:03,536 --> 01:04:05,668
I think this is
just a big misunderstanding.

793
01:04:05,768 --> 01:04:08,271
Don't fucking patronize me, David.
Why don't you tell me something?

794
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:13,076
Why are all the doors locked?
Okay, why are all the bars on the windows?

795
01:04:13,176 --> 01:04:16,376
Why is there a big fucking bottle
of phenobarbital stashed in your bedroom?

796
01:04:16,476 --> 01:04:19,615
- Jesus Christ, Will.
- Did you go through our things?

797
01:04:19,715 --> 01:04:22,585
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We should go.
- No. No. No.

798
01:04:22,685 --> 01:04:26,355
Something very dangerous is going on here,
and nobody's talking about it.

799
01:04:26,455 --> 01:04:29,909
We're all just ignoring it because
David brought out some good wine!

800
01:04:30,009 --> 01:04:32,595
- We are going, Will. We are going.
- No, I'm not going anywhere!

801
01:04:32,695 --> 01:04:35,137
We are going right now, Will.

802
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,345
It's all right.

803
01:04:52,744 --> 01:04:54,823
What's up?

804
01:04:56,284 --> 01:04:58,159
Choi?

805
01:04:58,586 --> 01:05:00,623
I'm so sorry.

806
01:05:00,723 --> 01:05:04,860
I was right here, and then work called,
and it's so fucked up,

807
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,036
'cause they can't do anything without me.

808
01:05:10,632 --> 01:05:13,909
- I called you.
- I didn't get it.

809
01:05:15,837 --> 01:05:18,313
You okay?

810
01:05:19,507 --> 01:05:22,527
Hi, love. Did I miss dinner?

811
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:26,582
- You missed more than that, bud.
- We have plenty. I'll get you something.

812
01:05:26,682 --> 01:05:30,165
- I'll fix him a plate.
- Thank you, Pruitt.

813
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,867
What's going on?

814
01:05:43,131 --> 01:05:44,973
David...

815
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,076
It's okay.

816
01:05:48,636 --> 01:05:53,800
- We really should go now, Will.
- Just give him a minute, Kira.

817
01:05:55,877 --> 01:05:59,478
I'm... I'm sorry, Eden.

818
01:05:59,578 --> 01:06:01,888
I know it's hard, Will...

819
01:06:02,218 --> 01:06:05,221
but you can't criticize us
for finding our own way through this.

820
01:06:05,321 --> 01:06:07,290
I've never done that to you.

821
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:10,665
I know. I know. It's none of my business.

822
01:06:10,959 --> 01:06:13,062
I know...

823
01:06:13,162 --> 01:06:15,198
and I'm very sorry.

824
01:06:15,598 --> 01:06:17,099
It's okay.

825
01:06:17,299 --> 01:06:19,141
It's okay.

826
01:06:19,634 --> 01:06:22,210
You're part of our family, Will.

827
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:25,347
All of you are.

828
01:06:35,182 --> 01:06:38,459
Will you... will you
excuse me for a second?

829
01:06:42,256 --> 01:06:45,734
Choi, eat.

830
01:06:48,896 --> 01:06:51,840
You... you got any more of that wine?

831
01:07:05,346 --> 01:07:07,523
Just gotta lather it up.

832
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,993
Keep washing.

833
01:07:13,121 --> 01:07:15,530
10 seconds, at least.

834
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,152
We should go.

835
01:07:43,252 --> 01:07:45,888
Let's go, then. Let's just...
let's just get out of here.

836
01:07:45,988 --> 01:07:47,676
I can't.

837
01:07:47,776 --> 01:07:50,331
Kira, I'm not okay.

838
01:07:51,158 --> 01:07:55,403
My son is dead. Where do I put that?

839
01:07:57,665 --> 01:07:59,874
I don't know.

840
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:06,681
It's like a scream trapped inside me.

841
01:08:08,409 --> 01:08:11,914
And... nothing changes the fact

842
01:08:12,014 --> 01:08:15,651
that I should have... I should have
been watching more closely that day.

843
01:08:15,751 --> 01:08:19,355
Now, look, you couldn't have known, Will.
You could not have been looking out for that.

844
01:08:19,455 --> 01:08:21,729
It's another kid.

845
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:26,155
And Ty loved him.

846
01:08:27,595 --> 01:08:30,800
And they were just playing.
They were just messing around.

847
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:34,136
- I shouldn't have let them have the bat.
- What happened to your son

848
01:08:34,236 --> 01:08:39,542
wasn't anything that could be
predicted or changed or...

849
01:08:39,942 --> 01:08:43,184
I've been waiting to die
since the moment it happened.

850
01:08:57,058 --> 01:09:00,563
Moving forward is not a betrayal, Will.

851
01:09:01,113 --> 01:09:04,684
Look at Eden.
That's what letting go looks like.

852
01:09:04,784 --> 01:09:09,356
You're not letting go of him.
I would never ask you to. You know that.

853
01:09:10,371 --> 01:09:15,077
We can help each other, Will.
That's the only way.

854
01:09:15,677 --> 01:09:17,986
I love you, Kira...

855
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,789
but I don't think you can help me.

856
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:36,037
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you are.

857
01:09:51,612 --> 01:09:53,546
Red velvet.

858
01:09:53,646 --> 01:09:56,458
- Miguel, you get the first piece.
- I'm excited.

859
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:04,399
Hi, Will.

860
01:10:07,461 --> 01:10:09,211
Can I see his room?

861
01:10:14,969 --> 01:10:17,012
Of course.

862
01:14:07,101 --> 01:14:09,510
<i>I know you have doubts.</i>

863
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:14,610
<i>Skepticism can be contagious.</i>

864
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:18,747
<i>I wouldn't have known either
before I saw the new truth</i>

865
01:14:18,847 --> 01:14:21,055
<i>and shared it with you.</i>

866
01:14:21,616 --> 01:14:25,195
<i>I wouldn't have believed,
but it was revealed so clearly.</i>

867
01:14:26,054 --> 01:14:28,529
<i>Remember the reward.</i>

868
01:14:29,724 --> 01:14:32,261
<i>This beautiful moment is upon us.</i>

869
01:14:32,361 --> 01:14:37,204
<i>Tonight is the night
our faith is made real.</i>

870
01:14:37,732 --> 01:14:41,436
<i>The hardest thing is to start.</i>

871
01:14:41,536 --> 01:14:44,172
<i>Just take the step.</i>

872
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:46,288
<i>Believe...</i>

873
01:14:47,342 --> 01:14:49,836
<i>and give yourself over.</i>

874
01:14:50,879 --> 01:14:53,048
Will, let's go. Everybody's waiting.

875
01:14:53,148 --> 01:14:55,050
<i>I love you.</i>

876
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:58,981
<i>I love you so much, my heart is breaking.</i>

877
01:14:59,521 --> 01:15:01,829
<i>I'm waiting for you.</i>

878
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:18,546
Okay.

879
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:50,311
Kira.

880
01:16:54,268 --> 01:16:56,644
Look at these people.

881
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:59,981
They're so happy to be here with you.

882
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:07,093
I think we should take a moment
to look at each other and really look.

883
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,496
Please raise your glass.

884
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
To a better world.
To peace.

885
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:25,334
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

886
01:17:25,434 --> 01:17:27,469
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

887
01:17:27,569 --> 01:17:30,939
Don't drink it! Don't fucking touch it!

888
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:33,754
- Will!
- No, don't drink! Don't drink!

889
01:17:33,854 --> 01:17:36,912
- Calm down, Will.
- No. No. We are leaving now!

890
01:17:37,012 --> 01:17:40,583
- Will, you do not want to go this way.
- Let's go, Kira. We're leaving right now!

891
01:17:40,683 --> 01:17:42,851
- Calm down.
- No, we are leaving now!

892
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:46,110
You ruined it! You ruined everything!

893
01:17:50,123 --> 01:17:51,816
Oh, my God.

894
01:17:53,461 --> 01:17:55,530
Oh, my God.

895
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:57,632
Sadie.

896
01:17:57,732 --> 01:17:59,407
Sadie.

897
01:18:00,267 --> 01:18:03,277
- Sadie.
- Oh, my God. Will, what did you do?

898
01:18:04,538 --> 01:18:06,547
Don't move her.

899
01:18:06,907 --> 01:18:09,964
- Sadie. Somebody call 911.
- I'm on it.

900
01:18:10,764 --> 01:18:13,988
Sadie. Sadie, can you hear me?

901
01:18:14,382 --> 01:18:16,691
Do you have a first-aid kit?

902
01:18:17,117 --> 01:18:18,960
Sadie, can you hear me?

903
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,836
- It's okay, Sadie.
- She's not breathing.

904
01:18:20,936 --> 01:18:23,460
- No, she's breathing.
- Not Sadie, Gina.

905
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,604
What? Gina?

906
01:18:27,061 --> 01:18:29,531
All right, get her on the floor.

907
01:18:30,932 --> 01:18:33,067
What's going on? Gina!

908
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:35,725
- Baby?
- Gina!

909
01:18:35,825 --> 01:18:38,914
- Can you hear me? Starting CPR.
- Baby?

910
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:45,111
Baby, it's gonna be okay.
What's happening, Miguel?

911
01:18:45,311 --> 01:18:47,762
- Somebody get 911?
- I'm not getting any reception.

912
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- I'm not getting a pulse, Miguel.
- Fucking door's locked.
- Gina, can you hear me?
- Come on, Gina.

913
01:20:08,963 --> 01:20:11,732
Come on. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

914
01:20:11,832 --> 01:20:15,337
- Tommy. Tom... Tommy.
- Come on! Let's go!

915
01:20:15,437 --> 01:20:17,051
Tommy!

916
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Kira! Kira! This way.
- What?!
Ben, this way!
Go left. Left!
- It's locked. Will, it's locked.
- Okay, okay. This way. This way.

917
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:44,238
Will! Will!

918
01:20:57,445 --> 01:21:00,187
The door. The door.

919
01:21:04,785 --> 01:21:08,543
Fuck. It's locked.
We're gonna have to break it.

920
01:21:11,258 --> 01:21:13,033
Kira.

921
01:21:28,809 --> 01:21:30,651
- No.
- Please, no.

922
01:21:41,222 --> 01:21:45,260
- Will, why is this happening?
- Listen to me. We are gonna get ready.

923
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,764
We're gonna do whatever it takes.
Do you hear me?

924
01:21:49,264 --> 01:21:50,999
- They are just people.
- Right.

925
01:21:51,099 --> 01:21:53,774
- Okay?
- Okay.

926
01:21:56,587 --> 01:21:58,696
- Okay?
- Okay.

927
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:01,115
- Come on.
- Okay.

928
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:18,532
Okay.

929
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:52,194
You weren't supposed to hurt
anybody like that.

930
01:22:52,294 --> 01:22:54,302
I know.

931
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:02,170
- Oh, God.
- How could you do that?

932
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:05,339
- Why would you do that?
- Don't do this.

933
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:08,643
We were supposed to just go
to sleep and go there together.

934
01:23:08,743 --> 01:23:12,514
- It was supposed to be beautiful.
- It's gonna be quiet in a minute.

935
01:23:12,614 --> 01:23:14,983
- We'll be there soon.
- It wasn't supposed to be like this.

936
01:23:15,083 --> 01:23:17,886
- That's not what he said.
- No, I know. It's just...

937
01:23:17,986 --> 01:23:19,988
We just have to finish now. Hey.

938
01:23:20,088 --> 01:23:23,725
Listen to me. We take it
one step at a time. We finish.

939
01:23:23,825 --> 01:23:27,061
- No. I can't.
- It'll be quiet and we can rest. Yes, you can.

940
01:23:27,161 --> 01:23:28,647
Eden, you gotta help me.

941
01:23:28,747 --> 01:23:32,033
- You have to help me. You can't leave me.
- No, this is wrong.

942
01:23:32,133 --> 01:23:36,305
Dr. Joseph said it was gonna be hard,
but we'll have to finish it now.

943
01:23:36,405 --> 01:23:40,075
- This is wrong.
- We were chosen, remember?

944
01:23:40,175 --> 01:23:43,278
We were chosen. This is the only way
we can leave this hurting.

945
01:23:43,378 --> 01:23:48,516
This is right.
This is the only way we can stop hurting.

946
01:23:48,616 --> 01:23:53,522
We can leave all this... all this pain,
all this shit behind.

947
01:23:53,622 --> 01:23:55,863
You can do this.

948
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:58,065
Hey...

949
01:23:58,892 --> 01:24:01,368
we can still get there.

950
01:24:04,431 --> 01:24:06,240
Come on.

951
01:24:08,401 --> 01:24:10,344
Come on.

952
01:24:38,765 --> 01:24:41,648
There's a door to the garage upstairs.

953
01:24:41,748 --> 01:24:43,638
- Okay.
- We're going there.

954
01:24:43,738 --> 01:24:45,612
Okay.

955
01:25:19,306 --> 01:25:20,949
Dr. Joseph...

956
01:26:16,831 --> 01:26:19,067
- Oh, my God.
- Choi.

957
01:26:19,167 --> 01:26:21,202
Oh, my God.

958
01:26:21,302 --> 01:26:23,377
Oh, God.

959
01:26:30,744 --> 01:26:32,814
- No.
- What?

960
01:26:32,914 --> 01:26:35,589
- No.
- What?

961
01:26:36,683 --> 01:26:39,804
No. No. There was a door here.

962
01:26:40,254 --> 01:26:43,425
- Oh, fuck.
- We had a door here when we lived here.

963
01:26:43,525 --> 01:26:47,202
Fuck. Okay. Okay.

964
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:49,821
Maybe... maybe we can
signal someone outside.

965
01:26:49,921 --> 01:26:52,230
Maybe I can signal someone outside.

966
01:26:53,762 --> 01:26:56,544
- Come on.
- Kira.

967
01:26:59,307 --> 01:27:00,781
Kira.

968
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

969
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:51,165
Don't be afraid.

970
01:27:52,308 --> 01:27:54,879
There is a plan for us, man.

971
01:27:55,329 --> 01:27:57,203
Will.

972
01:27:59,299 --> 01:28:02,376
Just let go. Just...

973
01:28:04,604 --> 01:28:06,547
We'll be there soon.

974
01:28:07,974 --> 01:28:09,883
I promise.

975
01:28:48,315 --> 01:28:51,658
Come on. Let's get out of here.

976
01:29:03,263 --> 01:29:05,138
Eden.

977
01:29:08,034 --> 01:29:11,861
I'm sorry, Will.
I'm sorry, Will. I'm sorry.

978
01:29:13,506 --> 01:29:17,017
- I'm sorry.
- Eden.

979
01:29:27,087 --> 01:29:30,397
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

980
01:29:41,068 --> 01:29:42,877
Okay.

981
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,649
Will.

982
01:29:49,376 --> 01:29:52,013
We are not gonna die like this.

983
01:29:52,113 --> 01:29:54,949
Hey, lis...

984
01:29:55,049 --> 01:29:56,651
I'm okay.

985
01:29:57,251 --> 01:29:58,553
Eden?

986
01:29:59,362 --> 01:30:01,395
Get the gun.

987
01:30:04,491 --> 01:30:06,366
Eden?

988
01:30:07,961 --> 01:30:10,371
She shot herself, David.

989
01:30:12,232 --> 01:30:14,374
That's good.

990
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,710
She's with them now.

991
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:23,550
It's empty.

992
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,523
We have a gun.

993
01:30:29,683 --> 01:30:31,692
That's okay.

994
01:30:34,621 --> 01:30:36,663
It's time.

995
01:30:37,624 --> 01:30:39,500
Don't do this, David.

996
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,329
Will.

997
01:32:05,278 --> 01:32:07,554
I miss him.

998
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:13,193
I miss him so much.

999
01:32:17,724 --> 01:32:20,434
I wanted to leave.

1000
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:29,610
I'm sorry.

1001
01:32:37,776 --> 01:32:40,621
Will you take me outside?

1002
01:33:14,247 --> 01:33:16,256
I hope...

1003
01:33:18,084 --> 01:33:20,327
I hope we...

1004
01:34:09,669 --> 01:34:11,511
I...

1005
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:14,942
I gotta go get Miguel.

1006
01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:16,850
Tommy.

1007
01:34:28,521 --> 01:34:30,330
Okay.

1008
01:35:18,172 --> 01:35:20,347
Oh, my God.

1009
01:35:30,384 --> 01:35:32,259
Kira.

1010
01:36:11,716 --> 01:36:15,638
<i>I might be a part of this
Ripple on water from a lonesome drip</i>

1011
01:36:15,738 --> 01:36:21,618
<i>A fallen tree that witnessed me
Him alone, him and me</i>

1012
01:36:23,892 --> 01:36:28,171
<i>And that life itself could not aspire
to have someone be so admired</i>

1013
01:36:28,271 --> 01:36:34,163
<i>I threw creation to my kin
with a silence broken by a whispered wind</i>

1014
01:36:36,856 --> 01:36:40,895
<i>All of this can be broken
All of this can be broken</i>

1015
01:36:40,995 --> 01:36:45,586
<i>Hold your devil by his spoke
and spin him to the ground</i>

1016
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,944
<i>And root to root and tip to tip
I look at him my country drip</i>

1017
01:36:52,044 --> 01:36:57,916
<i>Leathered up by all his fears
but someone brought you close to tears</i>

1018
01:37:00,265 --> 01:37:04,044
<i>Many trains and many miles
brought you to me on this sunny isle</i>

1019
01:37:04,144 --> 01:37:09,721
<i>And what of which you wish to speak
Have you come here to rescue me?</i>

1020
01:37:12,506 --> 01:37:16,497
<i>All of this can be broken
All of this can be broken</i>

1021
01:37:16,597 --> 01:37:21,032
<i>Hold your devil by his spoke
and spin him to the ground</i>

1022
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:34,857
<i>But the love of your life lives
but lies no more than where she lay</i>

1023
01:37:34,957 --> 01:37:37,951
<i>Your flower grows</i>

1024
01:37:39,653 --> 01:37:45,746
<i>The arms that fed and the babes that wed
The backs that bled keeping her in tow</i>

1025
01:37:48,924 --> 01:37:53,434
<i>But I am your keeper</i>

1026
01:37:57,342 --> 01:38:02,413
<i>And I hold your face away from light</i>

1027
01:38:05,654 --> 01:38:10,500
<i>I am yours till they come</i>

1028
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:18,768
<i>I am yours till they come</i>

1029
01:38:21,209 --> 01:38:25,241
<i>Eye to eye, nose to nose</i>

1030
01:38:25,341 --> 01:38:30,461
<i>Ripping off each other's clothes
in a most peculiar way</i>

1031
01:38:33,456 --> 01:38:37,397
<i>Eye to eye, nose to nose</i>

1032
01:38:37,497 --> 01:38:42,372
<i>Ripping off each other's clothes
in a most peculiar way</i>
