1
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:47,024
<i>- What do we want?</i>
- Health insurance!

2
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:49,109
<i>When do we want it?</i>
Now!

3
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:50,944
<i>What do we want?</i>
Health insurance!

4
00:03:51,027 --> 00:03:53,029
<i>When do we want it?</i>
Now!

5
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:54,114
<i>Yeah!</i>

6
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,723
<i>Come! Join us.</i>

7
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:15,052
<i>We will not go away.
We will not be stopped.</i>

8
00:04:15,552 --> 00:04:17,680
<i>And some of us
will not even eat</i>

9
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:19,856
<i>until these people
are treated fairly.</i>

10
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:24,774
- Daylight...
- What the fuck?

11
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,025
Sorry.

12
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:30,742
You'd think they'd be
too weak from not eating.

13
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:33,745
Honestly, I hope
they starve to death.

14
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:38,037
Yeah, seriously, then we can
get some sleep up in this bitch.

15
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:50,796
So I go to this party and Scott's like,
"You should totally rush."

16
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,347
And I'm like,
"That's retarded.

17
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:56,268
"That's for idiots who were
stupid enough to go to Dartmouth."

18
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:58,644
I'm on a hunger strike.

19
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:01,230
You're one of them,
I can tell.

20
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:03,183
Or I'm just not hungry.

21
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:05,360
Or you secretly want
to starve yourself.

22
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:07,403
Duh, what girl doesn't?

23
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:10,698
None of those girls give
a fuck about the janitors.

24
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:12,993
They just don't want to
look like they're anorexic.

25
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:14,866
None of them.
Not one.

26
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:17,698
So, what are they doing on
the lawn at 9:00 on a Sunday?

27
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:21,502
The only thing those posers care
about is looking like they care.

28
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:23,544
It's just some weird
demonstration to appease

29
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,794
their fucking white stupid
suburban Jewish guilt.

30
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:31,886
Hi. I'm Jewish.

31
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:34,297
I'm allowed to say that.

32
00:05:43,306 --> 00:05:44,728
Mmm.

33
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:46,308
Zabar's.

34
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:48,024
Kaycee! Come on.

35
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:50,231
What? They deserve
to get tear gassed

36
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:52,566
for waking us up
so early on a Sunday.

37
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:58,454
There's something
creepy about that guy.

38
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,498
Creepy or charismatic?

39
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:03,251
The two
go hand in hand.

40
00:06:03,326 --> 00:06:05,670
That's the kind of guy
you got to look out for.

41
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:19,430
People use the term
"female circumcision,"

42
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:22,103
but "female genital mutilation"

43
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:24,601
more accurately
describes what nearly

44
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:27,685
two million girls
go through every year.

45
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:33,903
Some cultures use a blade.
Like this one.

46
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:38,073
But more commonly,
FGM is done

47
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:41,453
with piece of broken glass,
the lid of a tin can,

48
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:42,999
or a sharpened stone.

49
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:46,499
Once the clitoris
or outer genitalia is removed,

50
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:50,299
the girl is then sewn up
and her legs are bound

51
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:53,092
for 40 days while
the wounds heal.

52
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:55,591
If they heal at all.

53
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,670
Kaycee?

54
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:59,216
Why would they do that?
I mean, what's the point?

55
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:01,727
The villages don't
consider them women

56
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:03,348
unless they've
gone through this.

57
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,724
From their perspective,
it's a rite of passage.

58
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:07,807
It's insane.

59
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:09,518
There's an ambassador
on East 44th Street

60
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,569
who should be doing
something about this.

61
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:13,147
My father's
a lawyer at the UN.

62
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:16,024
Maybe he could get
involved somehow.

63
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:18,860
It's not only
African countries who do this.

64
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:22,073
Muslims.
Middle Eastern countries.

65
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:23,657
Tribes in the Amazon.

66
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,708
FGM is a global problem.

67
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:28,788
You'd need every lawyer
in the UN to stop it.

68
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:31,543
Moving on. The "Ant Ordeal."

69
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:37,887
Why even bother
with safe sex lectures?

70
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:39,339
They should just
teach that class.

71
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:42,301
Uh, yeah. I used to think putting
in a tampon was painful.

72
00:07:42,384 --> 00:07:44,102
I know.
Excuse me.

73
00:07:44,427 --> 00:07:46,805
Hey, can I talk
to you for a sec?

74
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,640
I won't keep her long.

75
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:49,895
Okay.

76
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:51,609
Sure.

77
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:54,359
Nah, I just wanted to give
you a flyer for our group.

78
00:07:54,437 --> 00:07:57,031
Oh, thanks. I think
it's cool and all

79
00:07:57,107 --> 00:07:59,030
what you guys do,
it's just...

80
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:00,827
I'm not really into it.

81
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:02,422
Alejandro asked me
to give that to you.

82
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:03,909
Alejandro?

83
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:10,003
I mean, it's really
chill. No pressure.

84
00:08:10,078 --> 00:08:12,206
We just hang out,
talk about the issues.

85
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:13,335
The food's really good.

86
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:15,755
Wait, don't you guys
starve yourselves?

87
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:18,713
Some kids do, yeah.
Not me, obviously.

88
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:20,889
But tonight
we're celebrating.

89
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:22,764
School's giving the janitors
health insurance.

90
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:24,551
Really?
Yeah.

91
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,011
They're making
the deal now.

92
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:28,563
So, see you there?

93
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:30,474
I'll think about it.

94
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:32,309
Don't think. Act.

95
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:37,822
Don't think. Act.

96
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:41,576
You're not seriously thinking
about going to this, are you?

97
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:45,906
No. I'm acting.
Acting like I'm thinking about it.

98
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,284
Good. Because activism
is so fucking gay.

99
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:07,427
The UN Environment Program

100
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,638
handles matters
such as these, Justine.

101
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:11,815
Everyone is aware
of what is happening.

102
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,019
It's not something
that can be cured overnight.

103
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:17,945
Unless there was oil involved,
then we'd end FGM tomorrow.

104
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:20,274
Mmm. Were it so simple.

105
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:22,237
There are procedures.

106
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,284
We can't just go
invade a country

107
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,560
because they're
doing something

108
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:27,910
that we think is
illegal or immoral.

109
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:28,990
Anymore.

110
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:31,910
Where's your necklace?

111
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,545
It's in my dorm room.

112
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:37,670
Don't worry, it's safe.

113
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,668
You know your mother made that
out of your grandmother's...

114
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:43,381
Silver. Yes, I know.
I just forgot to wear it.

115
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:48,010
You know,
you should've kept playing.

116
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:49,218
Your mother loved it.

117
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:52,097
She also loved it when
I did what made me happy.

118
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,357
Playing used to
make you happy.

119
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:57,026
It still does. But I'm
not going to be a flautist.

120
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:58,728
It's not like I can
practice in my dorm room.

121
00:09:58,812 --> 00:09:59,813
And if I played
on the street,

122
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:01,239
people would throw
change at me.

123
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:04,196
Well, you were very talented.

124
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:06,619
I like to think I still am.

125
00:10:06,694 --> 00:10:09,664
You are. I just think you're letting
your talents go to waste.

126
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:13,414
Yeah. On books and college.
And terrible stuff.

127
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:16,421
The two are not
mutually exclusive, my clear.

128
00:10:20,124 --> 00:10:22,593
Are you going to have
that cheese bread?

129
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:25,008
Knock yourself out.

130
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:26,340
Thanks.

131
00:10:33,596 --> 00:10:36,691
Have you ever had fantasies
of saving a dying tribe?

132
00:10:39,602 --> 00:10:42,731
Of protecting them from
encroaching civilization?

133
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,658
Well, an opportunity
has come up

134
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:47,952
to turn that fantasy
into reality.

135
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:51,031
For those of you
who care enough to join us.

136
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:55,369
In two weeks, an untouched
jungle in the Peruvian Amazon

137
00:10:55,451 --> 00:10:56,794
will be destroyed forever.

138
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,248
And so will
the natives inside it.

139
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,957
The companies
want the natural gas

140
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,587
in the ground
under the villages.

141
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:05,800
So they GPS the location,

142
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:08,678
bulldoze the homes,
and kill the natives.

143
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:14,229
Ancient tribes, seen only
in rare glimpses from satellite photos,

144
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:16,731
will be gone forever.

145
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,026
So what's the plan?

146
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:22,862
March through the jungle
and starve yourself?

147
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,194
You must be a freshman.

148
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:32,614
Yes. Why?

149
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:36,493
Because only a freshman
would speak with such insolence.

150
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:37,827
You can leave now.

151
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:40,588
I'm sorry. I didn't...
Go.

152
00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:43,296
I said I'm sorry.

153
00:11:59,349 --> 00:12:00,601
Justine!

154
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,944
Alejandro takes his social
work very seriously.

155
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,363
You think?

156
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:06,940
Sorry. I'll try
and talk to him.

157
00:12:07,148 --> 00:12:08,274
Don't bother!

158
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:10,944
Anyway, thanks for coming!

159
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:12,028
I mean it.

160
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:52,614
Hey.

161
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:56,910
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other night.

162
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,833
I didn't mean
to be so flip.

163
00:12:58,908 --> 00:12:59,909
Yes, you did.

164
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,331
Save it.

165
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:04,130
We need people who are
serious about making an impact.

166
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:05,832
Not making jokes.

167
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:07,417
I am serious.

168
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,128
You're a serious student,
which is fine,

169
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:11,679
but it's really
not enough.

170
00:13:11,754 --> 00:13:14,098
Well, maybe if you gave
someone a chance to learn,

171
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:17,017
your organization
might be more effective.

172
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:21,431
What's the cause you
care about the most?

173
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:23,107
I mean, they're
all important,

174
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:25,355
but what keeps
you up at night?

175
00:13:25,893 --> 00:13:27,236
Women's rights in Africa.

176
00:13:28,438 --> 00:13:30,532
But how can a white
girl from the suburbs

177
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:32,825
go to Africa and tell
a village that FGM is wrong?

178
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:35,282
Exactly.
I'll tell you how.

179
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:37,659
You organize a group
and you go there.

180
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:39,491
And you get
media attention.

181
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:41,247
Right or wrong,
you need cameras on them.

182
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:44,295
That's the only way
people change their behavior.

183
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,840
The threat of embarrassment.
You must shame them.

184
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,005
Show me how.

185
00:13:51,753 --> 00:13:54,302
I think you're an
idealist, Justine,

186
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,599
and you have
good intentions.

187
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:58,889
But you're not
ready for this.

188
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:01,312
I am. Let me prove it.

189
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:07,356
The villages
are here, here and here.

190
00:14:07,435 --> 00:14:10,655
The development is going here.
A few miles from the Yajes.

191
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,700
Ten more miles and
the Yajes village is ruined.

192
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:16,699
And that's the end of
unmanned civilization.

193
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:18,863
Justine. Nice of you
to join us.

194
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:20,490
Late.

195
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:22,162
Sorry, I got off
at the wrong stop.

196
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:23,458
It's okay.

197
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:26,083
We leave Saturday.
We get in one day ahead.

198
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:29,291
So when the bulldozers arrive,
they're in for a surprise.

199
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:31,125
Who is behind
the development?

200
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:33,587
It's a private
corporation in Peru.

201
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:36,343
They hire ex-military to protect
them and to kill the natives.

202
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:39,266
So we're going to take on a
private militia with our phones?

203
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:42,221
No. But we're going
to scare them.

204
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:44,180
And the Peruvian
Government will notice.

205
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,651
Hi. Sorry. How are we
supposed to stream from the jungle?

206
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:50,569
They have a satellite.

207
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:52,773
Our contact will
hack us in.

208
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:55,654
I have 15 sites
ready to stream

209
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,782
and an army of followers
to tweet when we're uploaded.

210
00:14:59,403 --> 00:15:01,576
Once the construction knows
they're on camera,

211
00:15:02,156 --> 00:15:03,954
everything changes.

212
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:05,960
Just watch.

213
00:15:10,164 --> 00:15:11,461
Justine.

214
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,170
Are you sure you're here
for the right reasons?

215
00:15:19,507 --> 00:15:20,599
Yeah.

216
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:22,559
Good.

217
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:26,894
Be careful. The jungle's
a dangerous place.

218
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,816
This is crazy.

219
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,027
Are you going tree hugging
or bulldozer hugging?

220
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:41,408
We're staging a rally.

221
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:43,327
They're going to shoot you
and bury the bodies.

222
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,332
Well, then you can
watch my execution,

223
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:47,581
because we're going to be
streaming the whole thing.

224
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,333
I'm so watching that.

225
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:51,164
This sounds insane.

226
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:53,670
You know there's always
a non-violent way to make your point.

227
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:55,001
It is non-violent.

228
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:56,503
It's not violent yet.

229
00:15:56,586 --> 00:15:58,964
But trust me, these workers
see you fucking up their development,

230
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:00,844
it's gonna get ugly. Fast.

231
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:02,551
Not on camera they won't.

232
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:03,850
Two large cheese!

233
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:06,429
What does your dad
think about this?

234
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:10,858
Justine, I need some numbers.
Who are you going with?

235
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:12,810
It's a school trip,
Dad, I'll be fine.

236
00:16:12,894 --> 00:16:14,574
It's not like I'm
going anywhere dangerous.

237
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,028
I want you to talk to Dale.
I insist you talk to Dale.

238
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:19,324
I'm not going to bother
the ambassador of Peru

239
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,743
to get vaccination tips.

240
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:23,446
I am texting you
his number right now.

241
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:24,621
Dad.

242
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:26,908
Honey, Peru is
a dangerous country.

243
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:28,083
Do you know anything
about it?

244
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,706
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.
Dad, I really have to go, okay?

245
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:31,253
I love you, bye.

246
00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:35,124
Let's go before he
sends a SWAT Team.

247
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:39,011
Oh, wait.

248
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:52,566
Well, what do you
want me to say?

249
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:55,603
I think you're
100% wrong.

250
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:57,901
I think you're 100% whore.

251
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:00,942
I'm probably 50/50.

252
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:06,873
I love you.
I love you, too.

253
00:17:06,948 --> 00:17:07,995
Please, be safe.

254
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:09,700
I will.

255
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:10,831
Bye.

256
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:18,175
Justine!
What?

257
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,093
Nothing.
I'll see you later.

258
00:17:23,464 --> 00:17:25,011
See you Monday.

259
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:49,031
Okay, this way, guys.

260
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,426
A-ha! Alejandro.

261
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,929
Carlos. He's the man.
One of us.

262
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:09,302
Hey.

263
00:18:10,886 --> 00:18:13,605
Hi, nice to meet you.
Please, get in the plane.

264
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:16,893
How are you?
Hi, beautiful.

265
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:18,269
Daniel.

266
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,443
How are you?
Nice to meet you.
How's it going?

267
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:22,523
Hi.

268
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:26,490
We kiss here.
It's like a tradition.

269
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,576
Cool.

270
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:36,503
Okay, thanks.

271
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:56,931
What?

272
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:58,271
You're such
a fat guy in love.

273
00:18:58,351 --> 00:18:59,568
I am not.

274
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:01,145
There's nothing
sadder than that.

275
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:03,856
Dude, we're just friends.
There's nothing happening.

276
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:05,407
Get used to it.

277
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:14,909
You okay?

278
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:16,961
Yeah, thanks.

279
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,087
Small planes
always make me nervous.

280
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:21,291
Feel like we're
gonna crash.

281
00:19:25,336 --> 00:19:27,964
Okay. Everyone, give
a big round of applause

282
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:29,970
to our sponsor Carlos.

283
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:34,887
He's the one
who's making this dream a reality.

284
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,222
Thank you.
Thank you, Alejandro.

285
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:39,525
And thanks to you guys,
we will get this issue global attention.

286
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,819
All right!
Yeah!

287
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:50,278
Isn't it weird that that's the guy
who's paying for everything?

288
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:53,114
He's wealthy and he
supports our cause.

289
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:55,241
Just because he's
Latin and wealthy

290
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:57,372
doesn't mean
he's a drug dealer.

291
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:59,124
I didn't say that.

292
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,872
She never said that.

293
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:04,709
Yeah, I got it.
Thanks, Jonah.

294
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:15,011
It's Brad Pitt!
Justine, Brad Pitt! Come on!

295
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:21,100
Welcome to the jungle!

296
00:20:21,183 --> 00:20:22,810
These things are awesome.
It's like a motorcycle

297
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:24,445
and a rickshaw had a baby.

298
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,450
No seat belts?
Don't worry, I got you.

299
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,911
<i>Dónde</i> marijuana?

300
00:20:33,654 --> 00:20:35,998
Don't worry, bro,
I'll hook you up.

301
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:40,137
I knew that guy
would have the hook up.

302
00:21:46,977 --> 00:21:49,776
Hey guys,
grab your stuff and follow me.

303
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:52,199
- No helmets.
- That's chill.

304
00:21:52,274 --> 00:21:54,322
That's fucking insane,
that's like child abuse.

305
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:12,219
Good thing I got
that shot.

306
00:22:12,294 --> 00:22:14,137
Actually, it's not
100% effective.

307
00:22:14,213 --> 00:22:16,136
You could still
contract yellow fever.

308
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,342
Are you serious?
Jonah,

309
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:19,972
even if that's true,
don't tell her about it.

310
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:21,395
Don't get mad at me.

311
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,017
I bought this awesome bug spray.
It has DEET.

312
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:24,474
It's like...
A-ha!

313
00:22:27,935 --> 00:22:29,562
You're wasting it all.

314
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,443
Lars.
Here's your weed.

315
00:22:35,526 --> 00:22:37,073
<i>Gracias.</i> How much?

316
00:22:37,152 --> 00:22:38,278
Oh, don't worry.
It's on me.

317
00:22:38,654 --> 00:22:41,123
Careful, it's Peruvian. Very strong.
Thank you.

318
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:42,541
Sweet.

319
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:45,619
Thanks, Kara.

320
00:22:45,703 --> 00:22:47,080
Okay. Give me your phones.

321
00:22:47,162 --> 00:22:48,880
- Here, take mine.
- Here you go.

322
00:22:49,373 --> 00:22:51,091
I'm setting up
the stream app.

323
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,089
Make sure your
phones are charged.

324
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,263
Nice case.
Careful...

325
00:22:56,338 --> 00:22:57,965
I have very private
photos in there.

326
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,675
Don't worry, I never look.

327
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:01,886
I do. You have
any hot chicks?

328
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:03,346
Half the campus.

329
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:05,348
Freshmen.

330
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:10,186
Tomorrow,
no matter what, keep streaming.

331
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:13,610
Those cameras are
our only defense.

332
00:23:13,689 --> 00:23:14,815
Defense?

333
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:16,446
They have guns?

334
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,901
Of course.

335
00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:20,534
Which part of militia
did you not understand?

336
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:22,411
I just thought
the militia were like ahead

337
00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:24,457
of the bulldozers
in the jungle.

338
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:26,456
I didn't think they were gonna
be right next to them.

339
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:28,037
Wait, they
could shoot us?

340
00:23:29,204 --> 00:23:30,456
It's a risk, of course.

341
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,132
Well, then we should get guns.
Yeah.

342
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:33,208
Yeah.

343
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:35,969
These are our guns.

344
00:23:37,588 --> 00:23:38,589
Calm down.

345
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:41,099
There's a group of us.

346
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:44,099
If they shoot at one,
they have to kill all of us.

347
00:23:44,178 --> 00:23:45,270
What?

348
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:47,481
Oh, my God.

349
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:50,151
No, that's a lot better.
That's awesome.

350
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:55,982
Nobody forced you
to join us.

351
00:23:56,065 --> 00:23:58,238
And nobody's forcing you now.

352
00:23:59,193 --> 00:24:00,911
You wanna back out?

353
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:02,575
Go ahead.

354
00:24:04,073 --> 00:24:05,416
No. No.

355
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:07,918
Um... Mmm-mmm.

356
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:11,205
Okay.

357
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:35,775
Go, go, go, go, go!

358
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:39,526
- Go straight to the boats. Go!
- Come on.

359
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:47,867
Come on. Move.
Let's go.

360
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,122
Hold my hand.

361
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:14,856
What's he saying?

362
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:16,395
I don't know, it's Quechua.

363
00:25:16,478 --> 00:25:17,479
What's Kashua?

364
00:25:17,563 --> 00:25:19,156
She's a singer.
Shut up.

365
00:25:54,183 --> 00:25:55,183
Save your battery.

366
00:25:55,225 --> 00:25:57,444
There's no signal until camp.

367
00:26:00,773 --> 00:26:02,867
Have you been here before?

368
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:04,443
We came with
Alejandro, like,

369
00:26:04,526 --> 00:26:07,075
two years ago.
But, we never went this far.

370
00:26:07,154 --> 00:26:08,872
But don't worry.
I know where we are.

371
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:10,449
That doesn't need a signal?

372
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:12,376
No, it uses...
It uses satellite.

373
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:13,623
There are 12
geo-synchronous satellites

374
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:15,124
that determine
our global position.

375
00:26:15,746 --> 00:26:18,374
He has an older model,
but it's still pretty accurate.

376
00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:20,175
Thank you, Jonah.
Yeah.

377
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,550
Hey, is there,
like, a village or

378
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:26,048
<i>pueblo soon?</i>

379
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:28,092
Why? You need a toilet?

380
00:26:28,926 --> 00:26:30,724
Not right this minute,

381
00:26:30,803 --> 00:26:32,020
but I probably will.

382
00:26:32,095 --> 00:26:35,144
Yes, if we stop I'd like to use one,
too, please.

383
00:26:35,224 --> 00:26:36,271
Okay.

384
00:26:46,443 --> 00:26:47,490
What is it?

385
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:49,367
It's for the snakes.

386
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:50,990
I can hold it.

387
00:26:51,073 --> 00:26:52,074
It's three hours
to camp.

388
00:26:54,618 --> 00:26:55,835
Hey...

389
00:26:55,911 --> 00:26:57,163
Is there another machete?

390
00:27:03,085 --> 00:27:05,179
Don't point that
thing at me, man.

391
00:27:07,047 --> 00:27:09,095
Chop, chop.
We don't have all day.

392
00:27:17,391 --> 00:27:19,234
This is the girl's
tree, find your own!

393
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:20,856
Sorry. Sorry.

394
00:27:55,095 --> 00:27:56,517
Where's Lars?

395
00:28:01,351 --> 00:28:03,604
Go! Go, go!

396
00:28:03,937 --> 00:28:05,780
Tarantula...
Fucking bug!

397
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:08,780
Fucking bugs and shit!

398
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:11,487
A fucking tarantula
almost bit my dick off!

399
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:15,828
Use this.
Oh.

400
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:20,545
Not funny!

401
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:28,837
Look!

402
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:30,505
Oh, wow!

403
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:32,303
That's cool.

404
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:34,931
That's fucking awesome!

405
00:28:35,302 --> 00:28:36,428
That's my next tattoo.

406
00:28:38,263 --> 00:28:39,264
The Yajes thinks

407
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:41,476
that the black jaguar
is the guardian of nature.

408
00:28:42,142 --> 00:28:45,316
They also think that it
carries sinners to hell.

409
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:47,648
Good thing he's
on our side.

410
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:50,325
I think it can
just stay where it is.

411
00:28:54,154 --> 00:28:55,154
It's beautiful.

412
00:28:55,197 --> 00:28:56,995
This is a good omen.

413
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:11,464
This is it.

414
00:29:42,744 --> 00:29:43,791
Let's go.

415
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:14,952
Take those off.
They can get caught in the chains.

416
00:30:19,614 --> 00:30:21,116
But you take
your passports.

417
00:30:22,242 --> 00:30:24,119
Why?
In case we get arrested.

418
00:30:24,202 --> 00:30:25,249
Awesome.

419
00:30:25,328 --> 00:30:26,329
Kara.

420
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,792
Hey...
We leave it here.

421
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,462
No extra gear.

422
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:13,710
Go.

423
00:31:29,101 --> 00:31:30,603
We'll be fine.

424
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:32,028
Nothing's going to happen.

425
00:31:34,856 --> 00:31:36,403
That's our guy.

426
00:31:39,486 --> 00:31:41,033
See you guys at the plane.

427
00:31:41,113 --> 00:31:43,536
This is not
about the individual.

428
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:46,452
This is about the cause.

429
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:49,416
We are now one face.

430
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:51,915
Now stand up

431
00:31:52,582 --> 00:31:54,710
and make history. Go.

432
00:32:20,986 --> 00:32:22,112
Locks.

433
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:24,743
That's your kit, go.

434
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:37,252
Here's a lock.

435
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:38,336
Wait, wait, wait.

436
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,637
No, no, no. I got it.

437
00:32:40,797 --> 00:32:42,674
Go, go, go. No, go!

438
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,847
Lars, your tree, go.

439
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:48,396
Okay, good. Great. Thanks.

440
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:51,816
Go ahead, go.
Let's go.

441
00:32:55,478 --> 00:32:57,981
Good, you're good.
Okay, let's go.

442
00:33:08,074 --> 00:33:09,701
Okay, you're good.

443
00:33:12,662 --> 00:33:13,788
Kara?

444
00:33:14,664 --> 00:33:15,961
Kara, help me.

445
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,884
Kara, the lock...

446
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:28,136
Kara, the lock
isn't working.

447
00:33:45,946 --> 00:33:47,414
This is the Yajes' home!

448
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:49,082
Leave nature alone!

449
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:50,830
This is the Yajes' home!

450
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:52,456
Leave nature alone!

451
00:33:52,535 --> 00:33:55,539
This is the Yajes' home!
Leave nature alone!

452
00:33:56,414 --> 00:33:57,415
No!

453
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,842
This is the Yajes' home!
Leave nature alone!

454
00:34:03,922 --> 00:34:04,923
Kara!

455
00:34:15,392 --> 00:34:18,066
This is the Yajes' home!
Leave nature alone!

456
00:34:35,912 --> 00:34:36,913
Fuck!

457
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,049
Alejandro!
Help me! Alejandro!

458
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:42,173
Justine!

459
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:43,629
Alejandro, help me!

460
00:34:43,712 --> 00:34:44,872
Don't stop filming!

461
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:47,265
Don't stop, you'll kill her!

462
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,340
What do we do?

463
00:34:48,383 --> 00:34:51,011
- Raise up your phone!
- Don't stop filming!

464
00:34:52,304 --> 00:34:53,305
Please.

465
00:34:53,388 --> 00:34:55,061
This corporation,

466
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,393
murdering
the indigenous tribes

467
00:34:57,475 --> 00:34:58,943
of the Peruvian Amazon,

468
00:34:59,352 --> 00:35:01,650
is about to shoot a girl,

469
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,654
whose father works
at the United Nations!

470
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:07,118
The United Nations!

471
00:35:07,193 --> 00:35:08,820
Kill her,
and see what happens!

472
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,413
You fucking bitch!

473
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:29,136
<i>Sí.</i>

474
00:35:42,812 --> 00:35:43,904
Shit...

475
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,232
Oh, fuck!

476
00:35:45,815 --> 00:35:46,941
Oh, fuck!

477
00:36:01,748 --> 00:36:03,250
What the fuck?

478
00:36:15,136 --> 00:36:17,013
Where's my stuff?
Where's the bags?

479
00:36:17,097 --> 00:36:19,316
Shut up.
Where's the bags?

480
00:36:19,391 --> 00:36:20,893
I need my fucking bag!

481
00:36:20,975 --> 00:36:23,023
My pills are in that fucking bag.
I need the fucking bag!

482
00:36:23,103 --> 00:36:24,650
Shut the fuck up!

483
00:36:51,047 --> 00:36:52,048
<i>Gracias.</i>

484
00:36:58,304 --> 00:36:59,704
We did it!

485
00:37:01,391 --> 00:37:03,610
Holy fucking shit!

486
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:06,438
I thought I was going
to get raped in a Peruvian prison.

487
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:07,943
My fucking God!

488
00:37:08,022 --> 00:37:10,241
We're trending!
We're fucking trending worldwide!

489
00:37:10,316 --> 00:37:11,818
Reddit just picked it up,
guys, front page!

490
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:13,027
We're on the front page of Reddit!

491
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:15,079
CNN retweeted us!
Check out the photo!

492
00:37:15,155 --> 00:37:17,123
"The images broadcast

493
00:37:17,198 --> 00:37:18,791

498
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:31,887
Congratulations! We won!

499
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,256
Yeah!

500
00:37:46,936 --> 00:37:48,859
Hey, Lars, make sure
that disappears

501
00:37:48,938 --> 00:37:50,485
by the time we hit customs.

502
00:37:57,864 --> 00:38:00,287
It's important to
celebrate the victories.

503
00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:01,868
You're a hero.

504
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,163
You were going to
let them kill me.

505
00:38:05,288 --> 00:38:07,040
You knew the risks.

506
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:08,424
Yeah.

507
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,548
Just didn't know
the biggest one was you.

508
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,086
You begged me to join,

509
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,264
so I created
a role for you.

510
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,012
Don't forget that.

511
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:28,603
Justine...
Fuck off.

512
00:38:29,312 --> 00:38:30,359
What we did...

513
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:32,611
I said fuck off.

514
00:38:37,737 --> 00:38:39,535
He didn't mean for you
to have a gun to your head.

515
00:38:39,614 --> 00:38:41,833
That's exactly
what he meant.

516
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:43,785
This whole thing
was a mistake.

517
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:45,874
Look down there.

518
00:38:48,748 --> 00:38:50,466
That's no mistake.

519
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,353
What the fuck was that?

520
00:39:02,428 --> 00:39:04,806
Mayday! mayday!

521
00:39:08,101 --> 00:39:09,102
Seatbelts!

522
00:39:10,186 --> 00:39:11,187
Seatbelts!

523
00:39:15,692 --> 00:39:16,818
Oh, fuck.

524
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:41,176
I don't want to die!

525
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:22,050
Fuck...

526
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:27,226
Is everyone okay?

527
00:40:27,472 --> 00:40:28,473
No.

528
00:40:37,065 --> 00:40:38,157
I'm stuck!
What?

529
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:40,075
My seatbelt's stuck!
What?

530
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:41,494
My seatbelt.

531
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:51,128
Come on, we've got
to get off the plane.

532
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:04,926
Where's
Brooke? Brooke?

533
00:41:12,934 --> 00:41:14,607
Don't look.
Don't look. Oh, God.

534
00:41:28,282 --> 00:41:29,283
Fuck.

535
00:41:31,452 --> 00:41:32,999
Where's Brooke? Brooke...

536
00:41:40,837 --> 00:41:42,430
We need to find my GPS!

537
00:41:42,505 --> 00:41:44,052
We're in the middle
of the jungle!

538
00:41:44,132 --> 00:41:45,475
No one's
going to find us!

539
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,393
I can send a distress signal.

540
00:41:47,468 --> 00:41:49,721
The smoke...
The smoke signal's our best hope.

541
00:41:49,804 --> 00:41:51,932
Your GPS is melted, man!
It's melted!

542
00:41:52,014 --> 00:41:53,061
Stay calm!

543
00:41:53,141 --> 00:41:54,893
Panic solves nothing.

544
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:56,102
Look for it.

545
00:41:56,185 --> 00:41:58,608
Look, it's built to
withstand a crash.

546
00:41:58,688 --> 00:41:59,985
It's part of the
survival kit.

547
00:42:00,064 --> 00:42:01,316
Just look for it.

548
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
The GPS?
Just a cell phone.

549
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:13,127
Now we're really fucked.

550
00:42:16,497 --> 00:42:17,999
Lars, come on.

551
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:26,049
This whole fucking place looks the same.
We're just gonna get lost.

552
00:42:34,682 --> 00:42:35,899
Shh! Listen!

553
00:42:38,144 --> 00:42:40,146
That has to be the Nanay.

554
00:42:40,438 --> 00:42:41,906
If we can get to it,

555
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:44,450
we just follow it upstream
back to the construction site.

556
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:45,526
Yeah.

557
00:42:54,452 --> 00:42:55,499
Guys...

558
00:42:56,704 --> 00:42:58,877
I think somebody's coming.

559
00:42:58,956 --> 00:43:01,379
Hello?
No! Kara! Stop!

560
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:02,752
Kara, wait!

561
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Stay together!
Help us!

562
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:12,811
Run!

563
00:43:23,981 --> 00:43:25,449
The GPS!

564
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:28,448
Kara...

565
00:43:34,742 --> 00:43:35,914
No!

566
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:21,853
Please, stop!

567
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,683
Don't touch me!

568
00:47:01,032 --> 00:47:02,375
She took my hair!

569
00:47:12,126 --> 00:47:15,175
Help me! Please!

570
00:49:44,278 --> 00:49:46,451
What are they saying, Alejandro?
What are they saying?

571
00:49:52,828 --> 00:49:55,081
Where's Jonah?
Where's Jonah?

572
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,257
Jonah!

573
00:50:08,469 --> 00:50:09,812
Thank you.

574
00:50:10,804 --> 00:50:11,896
Thank you.

575
00:50:25,027 --> 00:50:26,199
Jonah!

576
00:50:26,654 --> 00:50:28,281
What the fuck
are they doing?

577
00:50:49,176 --> 00:50:50,177
Guys!

578
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,557
I can smell him.

579
00:54:24,975 --> 00:54:27,819
My God, I can smell
my friend being cooked.

580
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:37,161
It's useless, man.

581
00:54:41,617 --> 00:54:43,335
Oh, I feel like shit.

582
00:54:43,577 --> 00:54:45,955
Alejandro, what is this,
why are they doing this?

583
00:54:46,705 --> 00:54:48,582
They think we're the enemy.

584
00:54:49,374 --> 00:54:50,626
There's nothing we can do.

585
00:56:17,754 --> 00:56:18,846
Guys,

586
00:56:20,048 --> 00:56:21,675
I'm really sick.

587
00:56:23,594 --> 00:56:25,141
We're all sick.

588
00:56:29,057 --> 00:56:30,183
No.

589
00:56:30,851 --> 00:56:32,023
I need a bathroom.

590
00:56:37,065 --> 00:56:38,191
No! No! No!

591
00:56:38,358 --> 00:56:39,610
Go in the corner!

592
00:56:58,712 --> 00:57:00,714
I'm so sorry, guys.

593
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:26,532
I wish I'd died
in that crash.

594
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:32,295
Someone should be
looking for us by now.

595
00:57:34,915 --> 00:57:36,337
Look around.

596
00:57:38,752 --> 00:57:40,095
No one is looking for us.

597
00:57:42,756 --> 00:57:45,851
Even if they find the plane,
they're not going to look here.

598
00:57:45,926 --> 00:57:50,272
Our best chance of survival is getting
the GPS before the battery dies.

599
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:52,516
Our best chance is
staying right here.

600
00:57:53,767 --> 00:57:55,440
And wait for what?

601
00:57:55,852 --> 00:57:57,024
Lunch?

602
00:57:57,104 --> 00:57:58,104
Maybe we'd have a chance

603
00:57:58,146 --> 00:58:00,865
if we hadn't blown up
the bulldozers.

604
00:58:00,941 --> 00:58:02,113
You fucking idiot.

605
00:58:03,443 --> 00:58:04,820
We should feed you
to the natives.

606
00:58:05,946 --> 00:58:07,118
There's more on the way.

607
00:58:09,116 --> 00:58:10,117
More what?

608
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:12,457
Bulldozers.

609
00:58:14,788 --> 00:58:15,960
What?

610
00:58:23,547 --> 00:58:25,549
We didn't stop anything.

611
00:58:26,383 --> 00:58:28,135
We just delayed it
by a day or two.

612
00:58:29,845 --> 00:58:30,971
What are you
talking about?

613
00:58:34,474 --> 00:58:35,851
It's all a PR stunt.

614
00:58:36,977 --> 00:58:38,729
Carlos was hired by
a competing company

615
00:58:38,812 --> 00:58:40,735
to stop them from
reaching the village first.

616
00:58:41,648 --> 00:58:43,400
So we did.

617
00:58:44,526 --> 00:58:47,496
He gets paid and
our organization is known worldwide.

618
00:58:47,863 --> 00:58:51,333
You know how many people
are gonna join us after this?

619
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:53,539
Now we can make real change.

620
00:58:53,618 --> 00:58:54,744
What the fuck are
you talking about?

621
00:58:54,995 --> 00:58:56,247
Wake up.

622
00:58:56,872 --> 00:58:59,591
These people never
really had a chance.

623
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:01,306
There's too much money
in the ground here.

624
00:59:03,044 --> 00:59:05,843
The second company
is already on the way.

625
00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:08,717
They picked up where
the others left off.

626
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,892
Probably with the
same guards.

627
00:59:09,968 --> 00:59:11,015
Bullshit!

628
00:59:13,388 --> 00:59:15,231
This was
a fucking photo shoot?

629
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,693
You risked your life
for a fucking photo shoot?

630
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:22,109
Justine, I hate to
break it to you,

631
00:59:22,731 --> 00:59:25,359
but this is how
the real world works.

632
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:27,365
Everything is connected.

633
00:59:27,611 --> 00:59:29,909
The good guys
and the bad guys.

634
00:59:31,031 --> 00:59:33,705
You think the US government
didn't allow 9/11 to happen?

635
00:59:35,535 --> 00:59:37,879
You think the war on drugs
is something real?

636
00:59:39,706 --> 00:59:42,300
You think our plane
wasn't sabotaged?

637
00:59:43,585 --> 00:59:45,303
They probably crashed it
to kill Carlos.

638
00:59:47,255 --> 00:59:48,507
Justine.

639
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:51,218
Justine, this is good news.

640
00:59:52,469 --> 00:59:55,313
It's good news.
If he's telling the truth,

641
00:59:55,555 --> 00:59:56,977
then those bulldozers

642
00:59:57,057 --> 00:59:59,401
will tear these
motherfuckers to shreds.

643
01:00:00,435 --> 01:00:01,527
Okay?

644
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:05,403
How long until
they get here?

645
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:08,193
Probably three days.
Three days?

646
01:00:08,276 --> 01:00:10,244
I won't last three minutes.

647
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,288
I wanna get the
fuck out of here now.

648
01:00:12,364 --> 01:00:15,584
All we have to do is
stay calm and not upset them.

649
01:00:17,452 --> 01:00:19,750
Be thankful that they
killed Jonah first.

650
01:00:19,955 --> 01:00:21,252
He can feed them
for a week.

651
01:00:23,083 --> 01:00:24,255
Stop it! Stop it!

652
01:00:24,334 --> 01:00:25,586
He's not worth it.

653
01:00:25,836 --> 01:00:26,928
Listen, I can
get out of here,

654
01:00:27,003 --> 01:00:28,630
you guys just have to
help me. Okay?

655
01:00:34,553 --> 01:00:35,645
Samantha!

656
01:00:36,596 --> 01:00:37,848
Samantha.

657
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,437
Samantha.

658
01:01:17,554 --> 01:01:18,726
Listen.

659
01:01:37,949 --> 01:01:38,996
What the fuck!

660
01:01:39,075 --> 01:01:40,873
My God!
My God!

661
01:01:52,589 --> 01:01:53,932
No! No!

662
01:04:31,372 --> 01:04:32,840
Justine!

663
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,560
We have to get out of here.

664
01:04:56,606 --> 01:04:58,859
Don't worry,
I'll think of something.

665
01:05:02,362 --> 01:05:03,363
Samantha, what are you doing?

666
01:05:03,446 --> 01:05:05,619
You can't get leave,
you can't escape,
you can't get out of here!

667
01:05:05,698 --> 01:05:07,700
You can't leave.
We're next, okay?

668
01:05:07,826 --> 01:05:10,249
Please don't leave me alone.
I can do this. I'm fast.

669
01:05:10,328 --> 01:05:11,329
I ran track.
I can do this, okay?

670
01:05:11,412 --> 01:05:12,584
No.

671
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,041
I'll be back.
I promise.

672
01:05:16,376 --> 01:05:17,719
I promise.

673
01:05:23,091 --> 01:05:25,014
Samantha, wait. Wait.
What?

674
01:05:25,093 --> 01:05:26,310
I know how to
distract him.

675
01:05:26,386 --> 01:05:27,512
How?

676
01:05:30,098 --> 01:05:31,475
Wait.

677
01:05:32,725 --> 01:05:33,726
Shut up.

678
01:05:34,894 --> 01:05:36,646
What are you doing?

679
01:05:39,482 --> 01:05:41,325
Now. Go.

680
01:05:52,036 --> 01:05:53,538
Let's go. Now.

681
01:07:16,788 --> 01:07:18,131
Justine.

682
01:07:23,211 --> 01:07:24,463
You okay?
Are you hurt?

683
01:07:26,005 --> 01:07:27,177
What did they do to you?

684
01:07:28,132 --> 01:07:30,681
I don't know.
I don't remember.

685
01:07:36,641 --> 01:07:38,268
Samantha escaped.

686
01:07:39,394 --> 01:07:41,692
She made a run
for it, we just...

687
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:44,115
We don't know if
she made it okay.

688
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:56,252
Alejandro.
You know what this is?

689
01:07:56,828 --> 01:07:58,830
You know what
they're doing to her?

690
01:08:03,668 --> 01:08:07,548
They're going to cut her,
she'll bleed to death or die of infection.

691
01:08:10,174 --> 01:08:11,801
More days for us.

692
01:08:14,012 --> 01:08:16,060
Who the fuck are you, man?

693
01:08:18,641 --> 01:08:21,360
Guys. Guys. Listen up.

694
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,898
We're not going to die
in this fucking cage. Okay?

695
01:08:25,398 --> 01:08:27,071
We are all going
to escape tonight.

696
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:28,618
All of us. I promise.

697
01:08:28,693 --> 01:08:30,366
- Okay?
- Okay?

698
01:08:30,778 --> 01:08:31,825
They're coming.

699
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:12,703
It's useless, Justine.

700
01:09:15,656 --> 01:09:17,124
You're actually
eating that?

701
01:09:19,452 --> 01:09:20,874
It's pork scraps.

702
01:09:21,454 --> 01:09:24,128
If we're going to escape,
we'll need energy.

703
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:27,002
I'm vegan.

704
01:10:28,062 --> 01:10:29,405
Shit!
Amy!

705
01:10:30,356 --> 01:10:31,733
Amy!

706
01:10:43,035 --> 01:10:45,475
Look, as soon as they find her,
she's going in the oven.

707
01:10:45,538 --> 01:10:48,212
I'm going to add a special
ingredient that will fuck them up.

708
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:49,463
- Ready?
- I got her.

709
01:10:49,542 --> 01:10:51,715
Okay. Open.
Put the weed in.

710
01:10:58,134 --> 01:10:59,181
Is it in there?

711
01:10:59,469 --> 01:11:00,595
Okay.

712
01:11:15,443 --> 01:11:17,195
Any last words?

713
01:11:18,529 --> 01:11:20,406
Alejandro?

714
01:11:22,617 --> 01:11:23,618
Alejandro?

715
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:28,248
What the fuck
are you doing?

716
01:11:28,998 --> 01:11:31,626
If you don't want to
end up like the others,

717
01:11:31,709 --> 01:11:33,382
you'd be wise
to do the same.

718
01:11:34,212 --> 01:11:35,680
You're fucking psychotic.

719
01:11:35,755 --> 01:11:36,875
I'm not psychotic.

720
01:11:38,007 --> 01:11:40,101
When your body's
under stress,

721
01:11:40,176 --> 01:11:42,975
the only way to think clearly
is to find a release.

722
01:11:43,054 --> 01:11:44,414
What's
wrong with you, man?

723
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,686
Everyone is fucking dying,

724
01:11:45,765 --> 01:11:46,857
and you're fucking
jerking off!

725
01:11:46,933 --> 01:11:48,059
You sick fucking asshole!

726
01:11:48,935 --> 01:11:50,983
Violence is another way
of releasing stress.

727
01:11:51,062 --> 01:11:52,109
Oh, yeah?

728
01:11:52,188 --> 01:11:54,737
I'm going to release my stress
on you, motherfucker!

729
01:12:30,643 --> 01:12:33,146
You guys
and your <i>Scooby-Doo</i> plan.

730
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:35,777
You think they've
never had a little weed?

731
01:12:35,856 --> 01:12:37,324
They eat pot for breakfast.

732
01:12:38,734 --> 01:12:39,906
Better pot than us.

733
01:14:01,817 --> 01:14:02,943
Did it work?

734
01:14:06,781 --> 01:14:07,953
Yeah.

735
01:14:08,032 --> 01:14:10,751
Let's go.
You should watch more <i>Scooby-Doo.</i>

736
01:14:29,637 --> 01:14:32,982
Sorry. But I can't let them
just eat me if I'm alone.

737
01:14:33,057 --> 01:14:35,480
Fucking son of a bitch!
I'll fucking kill you!

738
01:14:35,601 --> 01:14:37,820
You know that, I'll fucking kill you!
Come on.

739
01:15:15,141 --> 01:15:16,768
What happened?

740
01:15:17,309 --> 01:15:19,528
They darted you.
They saw you escaping.

741
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,278
Where's Daniel and Justine?

742
01:15:24,066 --> 01:15:25,659
Probably dead.

743
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,992
They're still high.

744
01:15:36,412 --> 01:15:38,005
Oh, thank fuck
they're still high.

745
01:15:42,418 --> 01:15:43,510
See?

746
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,347
It's a joke.

747
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:52,011
Right?

748
01:15:58,684 --> 01:16:00,027
It's a joke.

749
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:03,029
Wait. No!

750
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:04,356
Oh...

751
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:07,492
Fuck! They have the munchies!
They have the munchies!

752
01:16:07,568 --> 01:16:09,195
Alejandro, help me!

753
01:16:09,487 --> 01:16:11,034
Sorry, I can't.

754
01:17:27,356 --> 01:17:29,029
Justine, look!

755
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:33,112
Let's go.

756
01:17:51,797 --> 01:17:53,049
I see some smoke over there.

757
01:17:56,635 --> 01:17:57,887
Come on.

758
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:03,938
Justine! Justine!

759
01:18:10,149 --> 01:18:11,571
Daniel!

760
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:12,776
Daniel!
Justine!

761
01:18:15,154 --> 01:18:16,326
Daniel!

762
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:29,214
Daniel!

763
01:18:29,543 --> 01:18:30,590
Daniel!

764
01:18:30,961 --> 01:18:31,961
Hang on!

765
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:35,634
Daniel! Daniel! Daniel!

766
01:18:36,008 --> 01:18:37,510
Help me!

767
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:41,013
Daniel! Daniel!

768
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,648
Grab onto it!

769
01:19:16,382 --> 01:19:17,634
Justine.

770
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:21,145
We're almost there.
Let's go.

771
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:40,914
Holy fuck.

772
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:10,773
Shit.

773
01:20:11,145 --> 01:20:12,146
The battery's dead.

774
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:15,483
Fuck.

775
01:20:16,734 --> 01:20:17,781
Do you hear that?

776
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:19,111
Yes.

777
01:20:35,836 --> 01:20:37,463
Daniel, it's Kara's phone.

778
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,428
Get on my shoulders.
Okay.

779
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:53,649
Someone's coming.

780
01:20:54,396 --> 01:20:55,648
Hurry up. Hurry up.

781
01:20:59,818 --> 01:21:00,819
Got it.

782
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,720
Help me.
Help me, help me.

783
01:22:01,255 --> 01:22:02,507
Please!

784
01:22:08,095 --> 01:22:09,096
Please!

785
01:22:13,142 --> 01:22:14,234
Daniel!

786
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,607
Daniel!

787
01:22:30,701 --> 01:22:31,702
Daniel!

788
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:41,428
Please! Please!

789
01:22:43,005 --> 01:22:44,052
Please, stop!

790
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:48,093
Please!

791
01:22:52,723 --> 01:22:53,895
Please.

792
01:23:09,114 --> 01:23:10,240
Please.

793
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:21,884
Help me.

794
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:22,961
Help...

795
01:24:23,855 --> 01:24:26,278
Let me go! Let me go!

796
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:27,901
No!

797
01:24:29,152 --> 01:24:30,153
No!

798
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:36,368
No!

799
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:38,003
Let me go!

800
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:39,871
No!

801
01:24:40,872 --> 01:24:42,044
Please.

802
01:24:45,919 --> 01:24:46,920
No!

803
01:24:49,131 --> 01:24:50,132
Please!

804
01:24:52,092 --> 01:24:53,844
Don't do it!
Don't do it!

805
01:24:54,553 --> 01:24:56,021
Please! Please don't do this.

806
01:24:56,096 --> 01:24:58,519
Please. Please,
don't do this. Please, God.

807
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:26,087
Daniel!

808
01:27:33,336 --> 01:27:34,838
- Daniel!
- Justine...

809
01:27:36,047 --> 01:27:37,299
My phone.

810
01:27:38,049 --> 01:27:39,551
Take my phone.

811
01:27:40,051 --> 01:27:41,394
It's in my...

812
01:27:41,761 --> 01:27:43,388
It's in my pocket.

813
01:27:46,808 --> 01:27:48,185
Take it.

814
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:49,732
Let me get you.
No.

815
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:50,858
Yes. Yes.

816
01:27:51,229 --> 01:27:53,778
Yes.
Justine, kill me.

817
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:55,984
Kill me.

818
01:27:56,067 --> 01:27:57,489
Justine. Kill me...

819
01:27:57,569 --> 01:27:58,991
I...

820
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:02,119
I can't. I'm gonna
get you out of here.

821
01:28:04,201 --> 01:28:05,418
Kill me.

822
01:28:05,911 --> 01:28:07,538
Please. Kill me...

823
01:28:15,378 --> 01:28:17,426
Justine! Let me
out of here!

824
01:28:17,506 --> 01:28:19,099
Please! Please
let me out of here!

825
01:28:24,554 --> 01:28:26,602
No! Justine,
don't leave me! Justine!

826
01:28:27,057 --> 01:28:28,775
Justine, please!

827
01:28:31,269 --> 01:28:33,317
Get me of here, Justine!

828
01:28:40,362 --> 01:28:42,114
Justine!

829
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:44,658
Justine!

830
01:28:57,796 --> 01:28:59,298
This is yours.

831
01:29:00,382 --> 01:29:01,679
Thank you.

832
01:30:10,577 --> 01:30:12,375
Shit... Fuck!

833
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

834
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,163
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! I'm American!

835
01:30:52,285 --> 01:30:54,253
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

836
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,960
Camera! Camera!

837
01:31:00,710 --> 01:31:01,962
Internet!

838
01:31:02,879 --> 01:31:04,756
<i>Filmo!</i> Camera!

839
01:31:06,633 --> 01:31:07,850
Camera!

840
01:31:08,635 --> 01:31:10,228
<i>Filmo!</i> You!

841
01:31:10,303 --> 01:31:12,397
Camera! Internet!

842
01:31:12,472 --> 01:31:15,521
<i>Filmo!</i> You!
You! Camera!

843
01:31:16,184 --> 01:31:18,027
You! Camera!

844
01:31:18,478 --> 01:31:19,946
Remember me, asshole?

845
01:31:20,021 --> 01:31:21,898
Smile! You're
on camera now!

846
01:31:23,942 --> 01:31:25,944
United Nations!

847
01:32:21,541 --> 01:32:23,088
Are you sure
there's no one else?

848
01:32:30,675 --> 01:32:33,019
Yes. I'm sure.
Let's go.

849
01:32:59,370 --> 01:33:00,462
Hey!

850
01:33:02,874 --> 01:33:04,376
Help!

851
01:33:05,668 --> 01:33:08,717
I'm here! I'm still here!

852
01:33:31,236 --> 01:33:34,490
<i>All the other students
were killed in the crash.</i>

853
01:33:35,073 --> 01:33:37,826
I stayed by the fire
as long as I could.

854
01:33:37,909 --> 01:33:40,628
But by the next day,
it had burned out.

855
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,333
If it weren't
for those natives,

856
01:33:44,415 --> 01:33:45,541
I'd be dead, too.

857
01:33:47,544 --> 01:33:50,718
They heard the crash
and eventually they found me.

858
01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:55,764
They fed me
and guided me out of the jungle.

859
01:33:56,928 --> 01:33:58,771
They knew I was lost.

860
01:33:59,097 --> 01:34:02,101
That I had accidently
landed in their backyard.

861
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:09,358
I never experienced
any anger or hostility.

862
01:34:11,067 --> 01:34:12,819
It was the opposite.

863
01:34:15,947 --> 01:34:18,791
I never felt afraid
when I was with them.

864
01:34:21,369 --> 01:34:22,791
Until the bulldozers
showed up

865
01:34:22,871 --> 01:34:25,340
and slaughtered
them like cattle.

866
01:34:29,919 --> 01:34:32,422
We're all very
proud of you, baby.

867
01:34:32,505 --> 01:34:34,428
You saved that village.

868
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,476
These natives...

869
01:34:37,969 --> 01:34:40,392
The Yajes.
The Yajes. I'm sorry.

870
01:34:40,638 --> 01:34:43,016
Allegedly headhunters.
Cannibals.

871
01:34:43,182 --> 01:34:46,652
Did you ever see any of that sort
when you were there?

872
01:34:49,564 --> 01:34:51,066
Never once.

873
01:34:56,029 --> 01:34:57,281
Justine!

874
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Justine!
I made it.

875
01:35:12,795 --> 01:35:13,842
Hey.

876
01:35:14,172 --> 01:35:15,674
Are you okay?

877
01:35:16,257 --> 01:35:18,726
Yeah, just a nightmare.

878
01:35:24,599 --> 01:35:28,604
- Free Samara!
- Let her go!

879
01:35:40,949 --> 01:35:43,327
Free Samara!
Let her go!

880
01:35:43,576 --> 01:35:45,374
Free Samara!
Let her go!

881
01:35:45,787 --> 01:35:47,585
Free Samara!
Let her go!

882
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:26,457
<i>Hello?</i>

883
01:36:26,536 --> 01:36:27,753
<i>Justine?</i>

884
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:29,171
<i>Who's this?</i>

885
01:36:29,247 --> 01:36:30,874
<i>My name is Lucia.</i>

886
01:36:31,416 --> 01:36:33,339
<i>I'm Alejandro's sister.</i>

887
01:36:34,085 --> 01:36:37,009
<i>I'm really sorry.
I actually can't talk right now.</i>

888
01:36:37,088 --> 01:36:39,511
<i>I... I found
a satellite photo.</i>

889
01:36:40,049 --> 01:36:42,051
<i>It looks like my brother.</i>

890
01:36:42,802 --> 01:36:43,928
<i>We need to talk.</i>
