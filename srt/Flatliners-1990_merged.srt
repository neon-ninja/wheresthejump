1
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,873
Today is a good day to die.

2
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,088
- What's happening? 
- It's crack. Get some help.

3
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,466
Crackheads take up all our time.

4
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,887
- What have we got? 
- Hemmorage.

5
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:25,478
- Vaginal bleeding. 
- Probably a street abortion.

6
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,983
- We've got to open her up. 
- All the O. R. 's are full.

7
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,863
- We can't wait. I'll operate. 
- You can't!

8
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,035
Just do it! Get him out of here.

9
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,125
15 years on the job and you're
gonna get me canned in one day.

10
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,503
Here we go.

11
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,672
Forceps!

12
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,967
Where is it? Clamp!

13
00:02:56,134 --> 00:03:00,889
- You got her. 
- All right, I've got her.

14
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,850
Dave, get out of here. Now!

15
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:10,607
Iabraccio! 
What the hell are you doing?

16
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,505
Randall Steckle,
"Diary of a Surgeon. " No.

17
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:38,760
Randall Steckle,
"Diary of a Surgeon to be. "

18
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,639
Randall Steckle,
"Making of a ... "

19
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:47,227
"Forging of a Surgeon. "
No, pretentious.

20
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:52,065
Randall Steckle, "Genesis"?

21
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:59,072
"Genesis of a Young Surgeon. "
Brilliant!

22
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,216
Morning.

23
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:23,304
Nice work. Keep it up.

24
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,937
Suddenly, even though
I was in a coma, I saw myself.

25
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,733
Suddenly, even though
I was in a coma, I saw myself.

26
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:39,195
Iike, from above, looking down.

27
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:44,909
Ralph, my husband, was crying.

28
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:49,289
The doctor was saying I was dying.

29
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,793
I saw myself in the bed
and everything.

30
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,256
I started to float out
into the hall.

31
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:05,263
Then into this tunnel
toward this light.

32
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,727
It was the most beautiful light
I ever saw.

33
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:15,023
I heard this voice.

34
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,278
It was the most beautiful voice
I ever heard.

35
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,948
And it said:

36
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,911
"I'm going to take your baby. "

37
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:34,292
"But you are going back. "

38
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:42,634
And I woke up, and there
was Ralph and the doctor.

39
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:49,349
I was legally dead
for 41/2 minutes.

40
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:54,312
But I didn't see no tunnel
and I didn't see no light.

41
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,817
I did ... and it was so beautiful !

42
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:03,571
- I was in this garden ... 
- This tunnel and this light ...

43
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:09,619
Then this guide ... 
and a chariot and music.

44
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:14,207
Terry, I think they'd better
get you off medication.

45
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,461
Thanks.

46
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,217
- What's up? 
- Good morning.

47
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,138
There's trouble in E. R. 
You'd better watch your ass.

48
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:32,017
Why are you always asking
the patients about death?

49
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:36,021
I'll be late for class. 
Thanks, Edna.

50
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:44,112
The spoils of arthritis. Some rather
resilient inflammatory tissue here.

51
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:51,036
We're now under the transverse arch
of the foot. The metatarsals ...

52
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:56,207
Brilliant, Dr. Steckle. Bring all
that talent with you tonight.

53
00:06:56,374 --> 00:07:02,630
Nelson, about tonight. I like you. 
I have to decline on moral grounds.

54
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:08,511
There enough atrocity in the world
without your own little horror.

55
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:14,184
It's ignorance we fear. When did
truth and knowledge become a horror?

56
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:19,230
Especially to a scientist
and a genius like yourself.

57
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:31,368
- How are you doing, Mannus? 
- Fine.

58
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,872
I've been meaning to ask you,
are you dating anyone?

59
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:40,001
- Identify. 
- Costodiaphragmatic recess.

60
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,171
Is it offensive
if I make conversation?

61
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:48,551
Sometimes it's nice to open up. 
Like old Lenny here, he's open.

62
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,681
- Identify. 
- Pylorus.

63
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,726
I've heard all the rumours and
nicknames about you, Rachel.

64
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:01,981
I'm sure you're a very warm woman. 
Not in the least bit repressed.

65
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,112
- Identify. 
- Your brains.

66
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,450
You want to come over to my place?

67
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:19,541
Dr. Hurley,
I need a word with Dr. Mannus.

68
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,795
- I already said no to this. 
- Steckle and Hurley are in.

69
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,090
Two of the top
GPA's in the school.

70
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,635
I need you to handle the injections
and the I . V.

71
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:35,473
I have no interest
in watching you kill yourself.

72
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,351
I think you do.

73
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:43,148
Good morning, class. 
Today's exam will be scaled.

74
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,818
Three A's will be given,
five B's and ten C's.

75
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:50,113
The remaining four
will get D's and F's.

76
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:57,996
As in life, you're competing not
with me, yourself or this exam, -

77
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:02,083
- but with each other.

78
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,796
There are a lot of others who'd
like to make a name for themselves.

79
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:11,634
It's a shame that the people with
the ability don't have the nerve.

80
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,847
- All right, we'll be there. 
- Speak for yourself, Joseph.

81
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:20,685
Sure, it'll be dramatic, Nelson. 
You'll cry or faint, puke at best.

82
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:24,898
But then what? 
I don't think you have the balls.

83
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:29,903
You just bring the equipment. 
I'll bring my balls.

84
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,280
Did you hear about Labraccio?

85
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,913
Dave, it's a four-month suspension. 
It won't affect your scholarship.

86
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,582
Forget it, I'm out of here.

87
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:49,381
You're the best they've ever had. 
They won't let you walk away.

88
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:54,052
- Besides, you were wrong. 
- No, damn it! She was dying.

89
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,472
I saved her life. 
What would you have done?

90
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:04,104
They have to make an example out of
you to protect their insurance bond.

91
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,690
They'll take you back next term.

92
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,193
It doesn't matter. 
I'd do the same thing again.

93
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,740
I know you would. 
That's why I need you there tonight.

94
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:20,078
There are a few people I'd like
to kill, but you're not one of them.

95
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:24,040
I don't want to die.

96
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:29,879
I want to come back with the answers
to death ... and life.

97
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,590
I can get there with the others ...

98
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:38,888
... but I need you. 
I need you to bring me back. Please.

99
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:46,146
I'm sorry, man, I can't do that.

100
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:52,277
Just walk away, Dave. 
Go climb a mountain.

101
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:56,948
I don't understand you any more. 
You burn your career on a stranger.

102
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,618
Now you turn your back
on a friend.

103
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:16,217
Iook, I'm real sorry
about what happened today.

104
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:23,516
- I won't make it back without you. 
- So don't do it.

105
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,364
Dave ...

106
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:42,202
What if it works?

107
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,987
I don't want to be buried
on Saturday.

108
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:23,034
It costs $150 more
to be buried on Saturday.

109
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:28,164
Mrs. Amsler,
you're doing much better.

110
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,296
Ieave a message after the beep.

111
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,256
I know you're home.

112
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:22,260
- Don't be late. Bring the camera. 
- What camera?

113
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:42,007
- Thank God he called a specialist. 
- No lectures, okay?

114
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:45,010
You're engaged. Grow up.

115
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:50,181
I'm recording a few last adventures
before resigning myself to monogamy.

116
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:55,687
I didn't realise. I thought
you were just a pussy marauder.

117
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:03,570
What the hell are we doing here? 
This is goodbye med-school.

118
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:07,699
Ten bucks says he shits his drawers
and we're out of here.

119
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:12,370
Not those lights. 
Security will come running.

120
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:16,374
Set up over the grate. 
I just got the boiler going.

121
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,754
- You're really going to do this? 
- Just humour the man.

122
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,300
Take me down with nitrous,
sodium pentathol and a cold blanket.

123
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,053
I've got some chilled D5W.

124
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:34,017
When my temperature is 86% ,
hit me with 200 joules.

125
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:38,396
The shock will stop my heart. 
Then take my mask off.

126
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:42,859
- You said Rachel was coming. 
- Steckle, shut the door.

127
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:46,613
You handle the injections.

128
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,117
When the EEG flatlines, the brain
is dead. I'll be exploring.

129
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:57,123
Give me 30 seconds. Set the blanket
to warm and take me up to 93% .

130
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:02,462
Inject 1cc of adrenalin,
and Joe, come in with the defibs.

131
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:07,175
- You bring me back to life. 
- With brain damage.

132
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:12,972
Resembling in many ways ... 
a Cabbage Patch doll.

133
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:17,394
Not with a body temperature of 86% .

134
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:24,192
Dr. Mannus,
will you handle the injections?

135
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:33,493
Wait a minute. Quite simply,
why are you doing this?

136
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,830
To see if there's anything
beyond death.

137
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,000
Philosophy failed. Religion failed.

138
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:45,171
Now it's up to physical science. 
Mankind deserves to know.

139
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,299
You're doing this for mankind?

140
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:52,595
This letter absolves you
of any responsibility.

141
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:56,599
This isn't for mankind. 
You want to get on "60 Minutes" -

142
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,562
- sandwiched between Andy Rooney
and the commercials.

143
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:05,650
"Tonight, a medical student who
experienced death and came back. "

144
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:10,530
- Fame is inevitable. 
- That's the wrong reason.

145
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:16,411
Dr. Hurley, electrodes. Don't you
want to be on "60 Minutes"?

146
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:26,004
Rachel, how about a little nitrous? 
At least I'll go out with a laugh.

147
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:32,510
Dr. Hurley, get the blanket.

148
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:40,352
We're all professionals. 
I'm sure this'll go very smoothly.

149
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,480
Can I have your apartment?

150
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,317
- It's a joke! 
- One minute.

151
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:52,530
Don't be late. Start filming now.

152
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:56,201
You'll have a complete record
of the experiment.

153
00:17:56,368 --> 00:18:00,538
Promise me
you'll go through with this.

154
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:11,091
One little kiss goodbye.

155
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:15,053
I'll see you soon.

156
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,774
- 96% . 
- This letter doesn't mean shit.

157
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:34,280
Iet him sleep. He'll have a wet
dream and think he went to heaven.

158
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:39,536
- Now I know why I'm here. 
- I've stated my feelings, goodbye.

159
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:44,624
Are you willing to risk your future
for Nelson's fame?

160
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,504
Someone's coming !

161
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:57,595
- Is he dead? 
- He's only sleeping.

162
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,432
Talk some sense into these people.

163
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:05,270
I'll do it. 
I've got nothing to lose.

164
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:08,523
- Just his life! 
- I can get him back.

165
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,445
- Just stop his heart for a minute. 
- Don't think I couldn't have.

166
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,287
No!

167
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:26,458
- Clear. 
- What are you doing?

168
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,295
- A systole. 
- You're killing him.

169
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:34,758
- No wonder you got tossed. 
- Stop this shit.

170
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:40,972
I did not come to medical school
to murder my classmates!

171
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:48,188
Flatline.

172
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:55,236
They're getting smaller. He's dying.

173
00:19:55,653 --> 00:20:00,492
- Brain death. Now it's real. 
- Start filming.

174
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:05,830
He's dead, isn't that enough? 
Let me try to bring him back.

175
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:12,712
- Just watch the door. 
- We're in the room with a dead man.

176
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:19,010
- One minute to go. 
- Start filming !

177
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

178
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:03,763
- 30 seconds to go. 
- Okay, let's heat him up.

179
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:32,000
- 20 seconds. 89% , 90% ... 
- Sodium bicarbonate ready.

180
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,090
I'm charging the paddles.

181
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:46,639
Monitor the EKG.

182
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,396
- Body temp:93% . 
- Here we go.

183
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:02,781
- What have we got? 
- Not a goddamn thing.

184
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:06,201
Up me to 300.

185
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:16,628
Begin CPR.

186
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:21,841
Sodium bicarbonate and eppy.

187
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:25,345
My God !

188
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:34,437
Not a goddamn thing !

189
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:38,650
- 98% . 
- Hit him again. 350.

190
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,155
Nothing.

191
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:51,329
Got him !

192
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:55,000
- Steckle, help me. 
- More eppy.

193
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:00,422
In.

194
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:13,018
We got REM .

195
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:27,032
- Nelson, can you hear us? 
- Welcome back, man.

196
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:34,039
- The crazy motherfucker did it! 
- Jesus Christ!

197
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:39,544
Steckle, that's some bedside manner. 
You'll make one hell of a doctor.

198
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,797
Suck me.

199
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,690
Can you recall any specific emotion? 
Heat, cold, anything like that?

200
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:46,736
- You can't be specific. 
- Did you see a tunnel of light?

201
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:52,659
No, but there is something
out there. It's comforting.

202
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:56,162
Have you any idea how big this is?

203
00:24:56,329 --> 00:25:00,709
He could use some air. 
You guys could get us some fluids.

204
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:06,047
- Thanks for saving my life. 
- It was so much fun.

205
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:13,972
- How do you feel, wise one? 
- Like a highly-tuned instrument.

206
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:17,976
Can you hear the traffic
on the lake shore?

207
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:26,651
Underneath that there's a hum. 
It's the street lights.

208
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:34,701
Even fainter ... I can hear
a kind of dragging sound.

209
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:40,081
- And it's getting louder. 
- No.

210
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:45,170
I not only hear it, I can feel it.

211
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:52,344
Yeah, your prognosis is excellent. 
You'll be great on "60 Minutes".

212
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:58,516
- It's bigger than that, David. 
- I'm sure you'll see to that.

213
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:04,105
- You're not buying any of this. 
- You forgot ... I'm an atheist.

214
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:09,277
Are you all right for a few minutes?

215
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:16,576
- How's he doing? 
- He thinks he's back from the dead.

216
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:22,332
- How's he doing? 
- He thinks he's back from the dead.

217
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:27,045
- That's what we did, right? 
- All we did was get lucky.

218
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:33,051
- I would like to go next. 
- Yeah, I'd like to be famous, too.

219
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:37,555
- It's not about fame. 
- They'll build monuments to you.

220
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:42,060
- Small stone ones. "Rest in Peace. "
- I'm going next.

221
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:46,147
I'd be willing to go
1minute 20 seconds.

222
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,402
1:30.

223
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:56,324
Are you two so competitive that
you're willing to bet your lives?

224
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,912
1:30.

225
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:06,084
That's it then. Not a bad price
to pay for fame and glory.

226
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:10,130
Die to be a hero,
but don't die to be a celebrity.

227
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:09,522
Champ?

228
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:24,454
- Someone ought to stay with him. 
- I will.

229
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:27,665
Are you okay?

230
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:31,461
I'd like to go home.

231
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:14,379
Are you okay? 
You were hyperventilating.

232
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:19,968
Your blood pressure will rise -

233
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:26,141
- as your
cardiovascular vessels constrict.

234
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:32,439
- God, you're beautiful. 
- Get some rest.

235
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:40,030
I bet 24 hours ago you didn't think
you'd be spending the night here.

236
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:46,911
You were lucky last night, Nelson. 
Don't push it.

237
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:53,251
ENGAGEM ENT PARTY

238
00:29:57,088 --> 00:30:02,135
I want to wish you two
the best of everything together.

239
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,065
Hello,
may I please speak to Anne Coldren?

240
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:21,654
Anne?

241
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:25,450
Hi, I've been thinking about you. 
How are you?

242
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:28,453
Counting the days
to Thanks giving break.

243
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:34,125
I've got to transfer to a school
closer to you or get a faster car.

244
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:39,297
- We should've married last summer. 
- My mother wasn't ready yet.

245
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:43,093
You know, you're the best.

246
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,471
If anything happens ...

247
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:51,601
- Joe, what's wrong? 
- l don't know. l'm just tired.

248
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:55,980
I'm not making any sense. 
I should go.

249
00:30:56,147 --> 00:31:01,236
- Joe, you're scaring me. 
- It's okay, nothing's wrong.

250
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:04,656
I love you. Bye.

251
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:35,038
- Nothing. 
- Starting CPR.

252
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:43,171
- CPR and adrenalin, and nothing ! 
- What's going on? Come on, Joe!

253
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:48,927
- Come on, Nelson, let me try. 
- We're running out of time!

254
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:54,599
- Let me try. 
- I'm doing everything I can !

255
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:58,603
- Nelson, step back. 
- Come on, Joe!

256
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:49,237
I got him. Oxygen.

257
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:54,576
0xygen ready.

258
00:33:57,328 --> 00:34:00,915
CPR successful. Hurley lives.

259
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:04,669
It's okay, Joe.

260
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,512
- It was great. 
- Here it comes.

261
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,848
Define "great".

262
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:22,479
I don't know, it's not thinking
about the past or the future.

263
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:28,526
- It's difficult to explain. 
- Yeah, dying is funny that way.

264
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:32,781
Nelson's right, there
definitely is activity beyond death.

265
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:37,202
- Absolutely. 
- The experience was strange.

266
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:42,207
- It was almost erotic. 
- He's dead and he gets laid.

267
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:45,669
What do you mean, erotic?

268
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:49,923
I don't want you to think
it was wantonly sexual.

269
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,301
No, that never
would have occurred to me.

270
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:59,224
It was friendly. It was something
vaguely feminine guiding me.

271
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:04,229
This could be the conquest of our
generation. The last great frontier.

272
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:09,609
First you had the sea, then
America, the West, the Moon ...

273
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:12,195
... Mr. Leary, drugs,
the inner journey ...

274
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:15,824
Our former First Lady
and the outer journey ...

275
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,035
- But this is ours! 
- We did have disco.

276
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:25,000
- Fuck the baby boomers. 
- Watch your mouth.

277
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:31,089
- l found something. Remember? 
- I came back from the dead tonight.

278
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:34,718
It doesn't surprise me. 
We had Elvis in here last night.

279
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:41,850
Pay when you're ready, okay?

280
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:48,898
- Was it difficult getting back? 
- Not that I remember.

281
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:55,113
But you remember everything else? 
I think you guys are full of shit.

282
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,286
- I'm not buying any of this. 
- I wouldn't buy it either ...

283
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:05,248
... unless I'd been there. 
So what about it, Dave?

284
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:11,463
- An atheist has nothing to lose. 
- I'm going next.

285
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:17,761
Nobody's going next. You're looking
for answers where there are none.

286
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:24,601
You just saw what you wanted to see. 
Give it up. It's too dangerous.

287
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:30,523
We can't turn back now. 
I'm going further. 1:50.

288
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:36,363
Two minutes ... 
I changed my mind. Two minutes.

289
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:39,491
- 2:10. 
- 2:20.

290
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:44,621
It looks like we found a winner.

291
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:54,506
Enjoying yourself, Nelson?

292
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:07,686
Joe ...

293
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:13,566
Was there anything negative
about your experience?

294
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:17,278
No. Nothing.

295
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:23,201
Good.

296
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:30,458
- Hold on. 
- Was that your idea of chivalry?

297
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:35,755
- Were you trying to show me up? 
- Not everything is about you.

298
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:40,969
Nobody seems to want me to go under. 
I don't need your protection.

299
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:44,264
What do you need, Mannus?

300
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:48,351
What do you think I need?

301
00:37:48,518 --> 00:37:55,525
When someone is as smart and driven
as you are, and very beautiful, -

302
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:59,320
- it makes the rest of us
very nervous.

303
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:05,326
- Why did you change your mind? 
- I'm the sceptic on this.

304
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:13,710
If I see there's nothing out there,
there's no reason for us to go on.

305
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:17,756
How do you explain
the similarity in death experiences?

306
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:22,719
People from different cultures see
the same things in the same order.

307
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:29,392
Maybe there's a hormone released
by the brain at the time of death.

308
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:35,440
No, you're reaching. What if you go
and there is something out there?

309
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:41,738
- Then you can kill yourself, too. 
- I'm not going to kill myself.

310
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:48,495
I'm glad to hear that, Mannus. 
I might miss you.

311
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:55,126
- So why this obsession with death? 
- It's just an interest.

312
00:38:55,293 --> 00:39:00,548
A personal interest. Goodnight.

313
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:05,512
- Can I drive you home? 
- No, thanks.

314
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:13,246
I didn't take the money.

315
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:17,542
I got the toaster, but too many
appliances make you love me.

316
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:19,711
Right, Nelson?

317
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:26,384
In the end,
we all know what we've done.

318
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:52,118
Champ?

319
00:41:36,454 --> 00:41:40,083
Come here, Champ.

320
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:44,129
Come here, boy.

321
00:41:50,635 --> 00:41:53,972
What are you doing here, kid? 
Are you all right?

322
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:58,393
Are you okay?

323
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,645
Are you lost?

324
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:27,088
Halloween morning. 
Rotting pumpkins, burning leaves, -

325
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:30,842
- black cats
mating like rats in the alley.

326
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:35,805
It were as if we felt no fear.

327
00:42:35,972 --> 00:42:41,519
As if we were already dead,
and had nothing to lose by dying.

328
00:42:41,686 --> 00:42:48,234
Because we lived life so well,
and loved life so much, -

329
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:51,029
- we imagined ourselves immortal.

330
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:57,035
Overwhelming the powers that be
with our passion for science.

331
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,996
Or maybe we were fucked in the head.

332
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,795
Hey, I'm Joe Hurley. 
You're Terry, right?

333
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:12,592
- You had a near-death experience. 
- I don't want to talk about it.

334
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:19,432
Wait a minute. 
I had a near-death experience also.

335
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:27,399
I need someone to talk to. 
This thing changed my life.

336
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:33,405
- At first, they didn't believe me. 
- What the hell do they know?

337
00:43:33,571 --> 00:43:40,912
If you have to go to class, maybe we
can discuss it one night this week?

338
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:45,375
All that day I knew
something was going to happen.

339
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:51,339
I've always had premonitions. 
Once, my aunt was to fly ...

340
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:02,851
Why did you do this to me, Joe?

341
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:32,649
No!

342
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:37,404
Trick or treat.

343
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:25,493
It's Halloween. There's a full moon. 
Aren't we pushing it a little bit?

344
00:46:27,245 --> 00:46:32,625
I'm sorry I'm late. 
I ran into some very big guys.

345
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:37,047
- Let me take a look at it. 
- I'm fine.

346
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:43,053
- Where the hell have you been? 
- I don't feel well. Look at you.

347
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:46,848
Just worry about your camera.

348
00:46:47,015 --> 00:46:50,352
Nice outfit.

349
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:54,022
- Are you ready? 
- I'm ready.

350
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:58,985
Who are you supposed to be? 
Boner Man?

351
00:46:59,694 --> 00:47:04,866
- 2:20, don't forget. 
- You just hurry up and get back.

352
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:08,119
You can buy us breakfast.

353
00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:11,873
Don't let go of the rope.

354
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:16,586
Hoka hey.

355
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:19,881
See you soon.

356
00:47:28,223 --> 00:47:31,976
20 cc's sodium pentathol in.

357
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:38,358
- 86% . 
- 200 joules charged.

358
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:44,489
Clear.

359
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:51,830
Flatline.

360
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:46,593
What hangs in the air palpably? 
ls it hope, or the fear of death?

361
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,889
- Shut up, Steckle. 
- No, you shut up!

362
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:56,436
What if he didn't make it back?

363
00:48:57,604 --> 00:49:01,107
Would you miss him, Rachel?

364
00:49:02,942 --> 00:49:05,403
One minute.

365
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:25,799
- 90% . 
- Give him another five seconds.

366
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:31,262
- Why not ten? We've got the time. 
- Are you serious?

367
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:35,433
Joey, l trusted you.

368
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:40,605
- Stations. Joe, move yourself. 
- Come on, no kidding around here.

369
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Who's kidding?
- What's going on here? 
- 92% .

370
00:49:50,156 --> 00:49:53,118
Joe, get it!

371
00:49:53,284 --> 00:49:59,416
Come on. 2:15, 2:16, 2:17, 2:18 ...

372
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:02,961
2:20. Hand it over.

373
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:06,339
This is my lab. 300 joules.

374
00:50:08,883 --> 00:50:12,053
Charged. Clear.

375
00:50:25,316 --> 00:50:28,111
Breathe!

376
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:33,742
- 1,000, 2,000 ... What comes next? 
- Knock it off, Nelson !

377
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:40,331
- 5,000. Breathe. 
- 300 joules charged. Clear.

378
00:50:41,249 --> 00:50:44,002
Come on, Dave.

379
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:58,683
- That's it! 
- That's not it. It's a v-fib!

380
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:03,521
- Try lidocaine. 
- Not yet.

381
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:08,693
- Come on, Dave. 
- Raise it to 360. Clear.

382
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,864
- Try lidocaine. 
- Three fucking minutes.

383
00:51:13,031 --> 00:51:18,745
Starting CPR. Joe, keep filming. 
I'm going to bring him back.

384
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:24,209
You lied to me, Joe.

385
00:51:33,968 --> 00:51:38,306
- We've got him. 
- 1mg eppy in.

386
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:45,689
That was close. 
That was way too close.

387
00:51:46,564 --> 00:51:49,984
- Hoka hey. 
- What did you say?

388
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:55,657
Hoka hey. It's the war cry
of the Sioux lndians. It means ...

389
00:51:55,824 --> 00:52:01,746
"Today is a good day to die. "
So was it, Dave?

390
00:52:01,913 --> 00:52:06,584
I don't know if I was dead. 
I may have felt something.

391
00:52:06,751 --> 00:52:11,297
A dream ... or just a bunch of stuff
stored up inside my mind.

392
00:52:11,464 --> 00:52:14,259
You were brain-dead.

393
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:18,346
Some electrical current
circulating through my body ...

394
00:52:18,513 --> 00:52:25,353
It would've shown up on the EEG. 
You were dead. So what happened?

395
00:52:27,272 --> 00:52:31,026
It's hard to verbalise.

396
00:52:31,192 --> 00:52:35,113
It's like being paranoid
without the fear.

397
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,617
Iike being watched. 
You guys were standing over me.

398
00:52:39,784 --> 00:52:44,456
- Who could be watching? 
- The dead.

399
00:52:44,622 --> 00:52:48,710
The sceptic did feel something. 
I'm going again.

400
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:53,631
- No way! I've been bumped twice. 
- Four minutes.

401
00:52:53,798 --> 00:52:57,802
- Labraccio went for 3:50. 
- That was a mistake.

402
00:52:57,969 --> 00:53:02,807
- Under four minutes is pointless. 
- Nobody is going for four minutes!

403
00:53:02,974 --> 00:53:06,853
- 4:25. 
- 5 minutes.

404
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:12,901
- I'm next or I'm out for good. 
- It'll be hard without her.

405
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:16,905
- But without me ... 
- Or me.

406
00:53:22,118 --> 00:53:25,205
Well, mutiny at last.

407
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:34,631
I trusted you with a brilliant idea. 
It was the chance of a lifetime.

408
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:40,887
- Give it a rest, Nelson. 
- None of you had my foresight!

409
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:48,019
Rachel, you want to go next? 
Be my guest, but this was my idea!

410
00:53:48,186 --> 00:53:50,271
You're tourists!

411
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:58,363
I would've gone 3:30 or 3:40. 
I still might.

412
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:04,369
But 4:25 is crazy. We're pushing the
five-minute mark. It's dangerous.

413
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:10,250
You shit, Joe.

414
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:13,795
You said you loved me, Joe.

415
00:54:17,298 --> 00:54:20,343
- l love you, Joe. 
- Buddy?

416
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:25,390
Skelator, are you listening to me?

417
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

418
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:37,962
Thanks for staying.

419
00:55:38,129 --> 00:55:44,594
I'm on the early shift. 
You seem fine. I'll see you later.

420
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:48,139
- About tonight ... 
- Don't try to talk me out of it.

421
00:55:48,306 --> 00:55:50,517
Why are you doing this?

422
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:56,064
I've lost people
that are close to me.

423
00:55:56,231 --> 00:56:01,528
I want to make sure they've gone
to a good place. Is that so trivial?

424
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:06,449
To tell you the truth, it's the best
reason I've heard yet for going.

425
00:56:06,616 --> 00:56:10,912
There's something
I didn't tell you about last night.

426
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:19,045
I had this feeling
that if I had gone any further ...

427
00:56:19,212 --> 00:56:24,801
... that there was something out
there protecting me. Something good.

428
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:31,766
- So you don't need to go under. 
- The atheist now believes in God?

429
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:37,689
I'm trying to tell you
that I don't want you to do it.

430
00:56:39,357 --> 00:56:45,989
Think about all we'll have to talk
about ... when you bring me back.

431
00:56:47,824 --> 00:56:49,075
I'm dying. Don't lie to me.

432
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:52,871
I'm dying. Don't lie to me.

433
00:56:55,832 --> 00:56:58,543
Mrs. Amsler, you've fought well.

434
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:04,215
- Sometimes we just have to let go. 
- That's what the voices say.

435
00:57:04,382 --> 00:57:10,430
- What voices? 
- They say, "Have you done enough? "

436
00:57:10,597 --> 00:57:13,850
"Have you told everyone
you love them? "

437
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:17,437
I have.

438
00:57:17,604 --> 00:57:25,153
They're friendly voices. They're
telling you what you need to know.

439
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:30,700
- What? 
- That you have someplace to go.

440
00:57:31,743 --> 00:57:36,748
- Do you believe that? 
- Yes, I do.

441
00:57:42,253 --> 00:57:45,256
Yes, I do.

442
00:58:29,092 --> 00:58:32,637
Hey, fellatio!

443
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:39,102
Got a match? Well, I do.

444
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:42,313
Your face and my ass.

445
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,443
- Your breath and a buffalo fart. 
- Do I know you?

446
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:51,239
You don't know jack shit! 
Butt-wad, needle-dick, cock-bite, -

447
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:54,034
- jack-off, limp-wrist, -

448
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:59,748
- banana-breath, shit-bird,
bird-turd, turd-face, -

449
00:58:59,914 --> 00:59:04,210
- kiss-ass, brown-nose,
macho-wimp, limp-dick!

450
00:59:04,377 --> 00:59:09,716
What's the matter? Gonna cry? 
Cry-baby Davie.

451
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:14,512
Shit-faced, rat-turd,
ass-licking, son of a bitch.

452
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:37,077
- How did it happen? 
- I was playing hockey.

453
00:59:37,243 --> 00:59:39,746
- About last night ... 
- It's okay.

454
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:43,833
- No-show Labraccio. 
- That's not like him.

455
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,673
- It's his way of trying to stop me. 
- It's not a good idea to continue.

456
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:53,968
- We don't need David. 
- Can you do this?

457
00:59:54,135 --> 01:00:00,225
- Can you trust me? 
- No, but let's do it anyway.

458
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:03,395
Nitrous on.

459
01:00:06,356 --> 01:00:09,401
See you soon.

460
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:30,422
How long's she been under? 
We're bringing her back.

461
01:00:30,588 --> 01:00:35,927
- She hasn't been under long enough. 
- Just do it, Joe.

462
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:39,055
Don't expect any kisses for this.

463
01:01:22,724 --> 01:01:30,106
- Aborting fourth experiment. Why? 
- Why don't you ask Dr. Death?

464
01:01:30,273 --> 01:01:34,611
- What's going on? 
- We're bringing Rachel back early.

465
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:40,784
- Drop it. Think about Rachel. 
- Joe's right. 91% . Let's be ready.

466
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:20,365
Rachel, don't go in there.

467
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:24,411
I told you not to do that.

468
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:27,372
Denny!

469
01:02:28,623 --> 01:02:31,209
It's your fault!

470
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:41,219
- Nothing. 
- Take me up to 300.

471
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:44,347
Come on, Rachel.

472
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:09,247
300 joules. Clear!

473
01:03:09,414 --> 01:03:12,250
- Got her! . 
- V-fib. We don't have her.

474
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:16,046
- It's okay, we'll get her. 
- Step me up to 360.

475
01:03:18,048 --> 01:03:23,386
- What did you do to me? 
- A short, maybe a circuit.

476
01:03:23,928 --> 01:03:27,766
- Joe, you charged the battery? 
- Shit!

477
01:03:27,932 --> 01:03:32,062
Starting CPR. Bag her, Steckle.

478
01:03:35,607 --> 01:03:38,193
No pulse.

479
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:09,974
- It's not working. Joe, take over. 
- She's been under 4 minutes.

480
01:04:12,143 --> 01:04:17,190
We're moving to bretylium. 
It's the only way.

481
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:20,694
Don't do it, you'll fry her.

482
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:26,574
Nelson !

483
01:04:27,325 --> 01:04:30,829
Please, don't!

484
01:04:36,292 --> 01:04:40,005
You'll bring her back?

485
01:04:43,299 --> 01:04:46,261
Come on, Mannus.

486
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:50,932
Iidocaine in.

487
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:55,020
Come on back to us. Come on.

488
01:04:57,272 --> 01:05:01,359
Wait!

489
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:06,448
I heard something.

490
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:11,453
Oxygen !

491
01:05:14,664 --> 01:05:18,209
She's back.

492
01:05:28,845 --> 01:05:34,059
- Why did you stop us? 
- Something happened to me today.

493
01:05:34,225 --> 01:05:38,355
There was a girl ... Winnie Hicks. 
I went to school with her.

494
01:05:38,521 --> 01:05:41,483
We used to make fun of her.

495
01:05:41,649 --> 01:05:47,906
On the train, she started calling
me names. Right in front of me!

496
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:53,536
- She was still only ten years old. 
- Maybe you fell asleep.

497
01:05:53,703 --> 01:05:58,917
- No, it was not a dream. 
- I've seen some odd things, too.

498
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:03,088
- I thought it was brain damage. 
- In your case it probably is.

499
01:06:03,254 --> 01:06:06,341
Shut that off, Steckle,
this is personal.

500
01:06:06,508 --> 01:06:11,179
I've been haunted by images of women
that I secretly videotaped.

501
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:16,726
They're all members
of the Joe Hurley Video Library.

502
01:06:16,893 --> 01:06:21,022
What about you, Nelson? 
Who's come looking for you?

503
01:06:22,273 --> 01:06:26,945
His name's Billy Mahoney. 
He's a kid we picked on in school.

504
01:06:27,112 --> 01:06:31,866
- It's no big deal. 
- Then what happened to your face?

505
01:06:32,033 --> 01:06:36,621
- The little guy gets carried away. 
- Wait a minute.

506
01:06:36,788 --> 01:06:42,210
I can understand Dave nodding off,
and pervert here having flashbacks.

507
01:06:42,377 --> 01:06:49,217
You're saying this guy physically
touches you. That is not possible!

508
01:06:49,384 --> 01:06:53,221
- This is too weird. 
- Weird? We've experienced death.

509
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:57,267
Now somehow we've brought
our sins back physically.

510
01:06:57,434 --> 01:07:02,397
- When did you know about this? 
- After Joe went.

511
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:08,820
- But you didn't say a word ! 
- Jesus Christ! We're scientists.

512
01:07:08,987 --> 01:07:14,409
It's reckless, immoral and unethical
for you to withhold your findings.

513
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:18,538
Rachel Mannus may have the answers
to life and death.

514
01:07:18,705 --> 01:07:22,334
She was under for five minutes!

515
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:27,422
If she walks out of that
ladies' room with those answers, -

516
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:30,800
- the whole world will worship her.

517
01:07:30,967 --> 01:07:37,140
- Just like you do. 
- You should've told us, Nelson.

518
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:42,187
- You wouldn't have done it. 
- At least we'd have had a choice!

519
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:52,530
We're fucked.

520
01:07:53,573 --> 01:07:59,037
- Rachel, are you all right? 
- I'm okay.

521
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:15,053
I said I was fine. 
Are you guys gonna watch me?

522
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:32,464
Come on, Billy Mahoney.

523
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:35,633
Give it your best shot.

524
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:42,265
I dare you ... I fucking dare you.

525
01:09:43,099 --> 01:09:50,231
- Things from our past want revenge? 
- I'm not exactly sure how it works.

526
01:09:50,398 --> 01:09:57,280
But if you see anything,
I want you to talk to me about it.

527
01:09:57,447 --> 01:10:01,284
You can tell the doctor.

528
01:10:01,451 --> 01:10:08,083
- I'll be in the living room. 
- Is it people we've hurt?

529
01:10:08,249 --> 01:10:11,920
Did something happen tonight?

530
01:10:12,962 --> 01:10:15,090
No.

531
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:20,178
Just try and get some rest.

532
01:10:24,849 --> 01:10:29,479
- How's she doing? 
- I think she's hiding something.

533
01:10:29,646 --> 01:10:33,024
- What did Nelson do to that kid? 
- I don't know!

534
01:10:33,191 --> 01:10:38,363
- We must keep each other informed. 
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

535
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:43,868
Why don't you guys take off? 
I'll stay with her. I'm sorry.

536
01:11:21,906 --> 01:11:25,577
We're gonna get you, Billy Mahoney!

537
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:30,081
No!

538
01:11:31,374 --> 01:11:34,002
Stop, Nelson !

539
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

540
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:08,661
- How are you doing? 
- I'm late. I'll see you later.

541
01:12:08,828 --> 01:12:15,085
- Wait. Where are you going? 
- I've got to stop her.

542
01:12:15,251 --> 01:12:17,962
Good morning, Rachel.

543
01:12:18,755 --> 01:12:22,300
No ... no ...

544
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:29,182
Her voices were wrong. 
There's nothing beautiful out there.

545
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:34,354
- Losing them is part of our work. 
- But I was wrong.

546
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:43,882
You look like
you're enjoying the day.

547
01:13:45,884 --> 01:13:51,389
- Don't you remember me, Joe? 
- Yes, of course.

548
01:13:51,556 --> 01:13:57,729
- Are you a model? You could be. 
- Look, I've got to go.

549
01:13:57,896 --> 01:14:02,359
I'm not picking you up. 
I just picked you out.

550
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:05,737
Mind if I buy you a drink?

551
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:10,575
- I'll call you this weekend. 
- Fine, I'm in the book.

552
01:14:15,288 --> 01:14:19,000
- Hey, gorgeous. 
- Who are you?

553
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:24,339
- What are you doing? 
- Some crazy girl ... Do I know you?

554
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:29,135
Would you like to? 
We don't have to do anything.

555
01:14:29,302 --> 01:14:33,682
We can just lie together. 
Hold each other in our underwear.

556
01:14:40,188 --> 01:14:43,274
I'll call you. I promise.

557
01:14:43,441 --> 01:14:47,487
I'm tired of playing the field.

558
01:14:47,654 --> 01:14:51,074
We can stop whenever you want.

559
01:14:52,617 --> 01:14:55,954
It'll only
make our relationship better.

560
01:14:57,789 --> 01:15:01,001
I've never felt like this before.

561
01:15:04,004 --> 01:15:07,799
Of course I respect you.

562
01:15:14,472 --> 01:15:19,728
- Call me whenever you want. 
- Show me that you love me.

563
01:15:19,894 --> 01:15:23,314
You're not real !

564
01:15:27,902 --> 01:15:31,156
Anne, is that you?

565
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:39,414
- Is it really you? 
- You sounded so upset on the phone.

566
01:15:39,581 --> 01:15:44,878
- I was worried. I took the bus. 
- What a great surprise.

567
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:50,925
- How long have you been here? 
- Long enough to see your tapes.

568
01:15:52,385 --> 01:15:55,638
My God !

569
01:15:55,805 --> 01:16:02,020
You're gonna think I'm leaving you
because you slept with those girls.

570
01:16:02,187 --> 01:16:05,023
They meant nothing to me.

571
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:10,653
I wish they had meant something. 
If you had cared for any of them, -

572
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:13,615
- I could have fought that.

573
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:18,119
But to film all those girls ... 
To have so little respect ...

574
01:16:18,286 --> 01:16:24,668
Those women trusted you. 
You have no understanding of trust.

575
01:16:26,544 --> 01:16:31,257
- It's not what you think. 
- Yes, it is.

576
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:32,967
Hello, is this Mrs. Earl R. Hicks?

577
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:35,929
Hello, is this Mrs. Earl R. Hicks?

578
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:40,975
Do you have a daughter Winnie,
about 26 years old?

579
01:16:41,142 --> 01:16:46,898
You do? I'm David Labraccio. 
I was in school with Winnie.

580
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:50,402
Yeah, my parents still live there.

581
01:16:50,568 --> 01:16:54,823
I wanted to get in touch with her
and I was wondering ...

582
01:16:58,827 --> 01:17:02,497
Okay. Do you have her address?

583
01:17:03,623 --> 01:17:07,127
Great. I really appreciate it. Bye.

584
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:19,723
- Jesus! 
- It looks as bad as it feels?

585
01:17:19,889 --> 01:17:24,936
- You want me to take a look at it? 
- No. How's Rachel doing?

586
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:29,983
She didn't come out of that bathroom
with the answers to life and death.

587
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:34,946
Where are you going? 
Can I go?

588
01:17:35,113 --> 01:17:42,412
- It's a two hour drive. 
- I don't want to be alone.

589
01:17:43,329 --> 01:17:50,170
You will remove the left kidney
and dissect the lower intestines.

590
01:17:50,337 --> 01:17:56,509
Remove the ascending colon
from the transverse colon.

591
01:17:56,676 --> 01:18:02,265
Proceed to the sigmoid colon
and on to the appendix.

592
01:18:04,768 --> 01:18:09,397
- Where the hell are you going? 
- Are you okay?

593
01:18:09,564 --> 01:18:15,820
I would be fine if everyone would
stop asking me if I'm all right.

594
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:23,286
- Is she getting the heebie-jeebies? 
- I'm spooking, too.

595
01:18:23,453 --> 01:18:27,665
Getting us kicked out of med-school
won't get Anne back.

596
01:19:19,467 --> 01:19:21,261
Mannus!

597
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:27,559
I'll handle this. Back to work
or suffer the consequences.

598
01:19:27,726 --> 01:19:29,936
Fuck it.

599
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:42,574
- This must be it. 
- Winnie did well for herself.

600
01:19:42,741 --> 01:19:48,079
- She won't even remember you. 
- It's worth a shot.

601
01:19:48,246 --> 01:19:51,583
- Are you coming? 
- No.

602
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:58,214
Iisten, if anything happens .... 
If you need me, just honk the horn.

603
01:20:25,784 --> 01:20:31,373
Ring, ring, ring. 
Dave, you should've sent a letter.

604
01:20:31,539 --> 01:20:34,834
Anybody home?

605
01:20:40,131 --> 01:20:45,720
- Hi, is your mother at home? 
- Coming.

606
01:20:48,056 --> 01:20:50,975
Go in the house, baby.

607
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:57,982
- Yes? Can I help you? 
- Yeah, I think you can.

608
01:20:58,149 --> 01:21:03,071
Are you Winnie Hicks? 
From Claremont?

609
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:09,327
I'm David Labraccio. 
We went to school together.

610
01:21:09,494 --> 01:21:13,248
I was a little smaller then.

611
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:18,253
I just drove up from the city. 
That's my truck.

612
01:21:20,755 --> 01:21:24,175
Hello, I'm nice. He's nice.

613
01:21:24,342 --> 01:21:28,763
We're both fucking lunatics. 
Can I come in, please?

614
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:37,230
I've got to hand it to you, Dave ... 
you've got guts.

615
01:22:17,062 --> 01:22:22,108
This is beautiful. 
You've done well for yourself.

616
01:22:22,275 --> 01:22:26,029
Well, it isn't medical school.

617
01:22:26,196 --> 01:22:30,116
But I never liked school anyway.

618
01:22:30,283 --> 01:22:33,870
I wasn't very good at it.

619
01:22:34,037 --> 01:22:38,583
- I'm surprised you remember me. 
- I do remember you.

620
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:42,712
I also remember the way
we treated you back then.

621
01:22:42,879 --> 01:22:49,552
You were a little shy, and I was
a real jerk ... and I'm sorry.

622
01:22:49,719 --> 01:22:56,935
What are you talking about? That was
so long ago I don't even remember.

623
01:22:57,102 --> 01:23:00,188
Iet's not dredge up all that stuff.

624
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:07,529
However we made you feel ... 
it was wrong. We were wrong.

625
01:23:09,906 --> 01:23:12,617
Go on.

626
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:21,251
I have a family now.

627
01:23:21,418 --> 01:23:24,963
I haven't been that ugly little girl
in quite some time.

628
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:29,300
You were never ugly.

629
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:33,930
Why did you come here?

630
01:24:10,175 --> 01:24:12,844
David, help!

631
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:18,725
I know how kids are. 
It didn't mean anything.

632
01:24:18,892 --> 01:24:26,149
- I didn't mean to come here ... 
- Winnie, are you all right?

633
01:24:26,316 --> 01:24:28,610
I'm fine, Ben.

634
01:24:37,118 --> 01:24:43,208
I'm sorry if I made you feel bad. 
I didn't want to hurt you again.

635
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:47,962
I'm gonna go.

636
01:24:51,132 --> 01:24:53,927
David?

637
01:24:56,054 --> 01:24:58,056
Thank you.

638
01:24:59,057 --> 01:25:02,602
Are you sure?

639
01:25:04,312 --> 01:25:07,107
Thanks.

640
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
David, help!

641
01:26:17,135 --> 01:26:21,556
Nelson, stop. Stop!

642
01:26:24,517 --> 01:26:31,483
- Where's Billy Mahoney? 
- No one's here but the two of us.

643
01:26:31,649 --> 01:26:34,069
Iet go!

644
01:27:03,598 --> 01:27:06,351
Where the hell have you guys been?

645
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:13,608
- She freaked in class. 
- How are you doing?

646
01:27:13,775 --> 01:27:21,408
Fine, for somebody who keeps seeing
her father who's been dead 20 years.

647
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:26,871
"Death is beautiful. "
What a bunch of crap.

648
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:33,878
How are you doing, Nelson? Okay?

649
01:27:36,172 --> 01:27:39,384
I'd like to thank you
for the nightmare.

650
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:45,890
You were so eager to jump on ... 
Welcome aboard.

651
01:27:46,057 --> 01:27:48,393
You withheld information.

652
01:27:49,853 --> 01:27:53,898
- I'm sorry you're so upset. 
- You're not the only one at risk!

653
01:27:54,065 --> 01:28:00,905
- I always felt this was unnatural. 
- Steckle, you didn't risk a thing.

654
01:28:01,072 --> 01:28:05,785
- Stop! We're all in this together. 
- No, we're not.

655
01:28:05,952 --> 01:28:09,664
Isn't she strong? So independent.

656
01:28:09,831 --> 01:28:13,251
When I get into trouble,
I don't drag everybody down with me.

657
01:28:13,418 --> 01:28:18,923
Come on ! What happened to you? 
Caught with your videotapes down.

658
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:25,305
You swore at a little girl. You're
having bad dreams about your daddy.

659
01:28:25,472 --> 01:28:30,769
- I'm really sorry! 
- You don't know anything about me.

660
01:28:30,935 --> 01:28:34,981
But Dave does, doesn't he?

661
01:28:35,148 --> 01:28:40,779
Come on, they're your sins. 
Live with them ... I do.

662
01:28:40,945 --> 01:28:45,283
You want to see death? 
Take a good look. It is beautiful.

663
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:50,789
You've already hurt yourself. 
Do you want to hurt her, too?

664
01:28:54,417 --> 01:29:00,757
Help him find Billy Mahoney. 
Just do it, all right?

665
01:29:00,924 --> 01:29:06,805
- Don't leave him alone. 
- Why do we want to find Billy?

666
01:29:06,971 --> 01:29:13,728
Young Dr. Dave thinks
he's solved our karmic problems.

667
01:29:15,313 --> 01:29:19,776
- Atonement, gentlemen. 
- Atonement?

668
01:29:19,943 --> 01:29:25,407
Wait a goddamn minute! 
You're always running away from me.

669
01:29:25,573 --> 01:29:29,077
Why don't you talk to me?

670
01:29:32,831 --> 01:29:38,211
- My father shot himself. 
- And you feel responsible?

671
01:29:39,337 --> 01:29:44,592
There was this door in our hallway
and I wasn't supposed to go in ...

672
01:29:44,759 --> 01:29:49,973
Kids always feel responsible. 
You could not have been to blame.

673
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:56,021
You said it yourself. 
People we've wronged want revenge.

674
01:29:56,187 --> 01:30:00,650
I don't know if this will help,
but going to see Winnie Hicks ...

675
01:30:00,817 --> 01:30:10,493
I can't explain, but it lifted ... 
just asking for forgiveness ...

676
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:14,539
Winnie Hicks is alive. 
My father's dead.

677
01:30:14,706 --> 01:30:19,252
Your father is in a good place.

678
01:30:19,419 --> 01:30:23,214
He wants you to let him go.

679
01:30:24,382 --> 01:30:27,552
Then why is he back?

680
01:30:42,067 --> 01:30:43,860
Here.

681
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:48,323
- Where the hell are we? 
- We'd better get you to a hospital.

682
01:30:55,121 --> 01:31:00,794
Come on, this is a short cut. 
I can't believe I remember all this.

683
01:31:03,797 --> 01:31:09,928
- The neighbourhood's falling apart. 
- Give me the keys!

684
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:13,598
Step on a crack
break your mother's back ...

685
01:31:18,061 --> 01:31:23,942
Iast one over is a rotten egg !

686
01:31:25,151 --> 01:31:29,239
Come on, boys,
salvation just ahead.

687
01:31:44,462 --> 01:31:48,925
This is a graveyard.

688
01:31:49,092 --> 01:31:55,473
Nelson, where the fuck are you? 
This isn't funny any more.

689
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:58,268
It never was.

690
01:31:58,435 --> 01:32:01,146
- Where the hell are you? 
- Right here.

691
01:32:06,526 --> 01:32:11,656
This is where Billy lives. Wake up,
you little shit, you've got company!

692
01:32:12,657 --> 01:32:18,663
I knew he was here ... 
because I put him here.

693
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:24,085
- Billy Mahoney! 
- No, Nelson, don't do it!

694
01:33:03,667 --> 01:33:08,004
I was taken away from my family
when I was nine years old.

695
01:33:08,171 --> 01:33:14,386
I went to Stoneham School for Boys. 
I thought I'd paid my dues!

696
01:33:14,552 --> 01:33:20,183
It was an accident. 
Let's go home, okay?

697
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:26,815
Dave's right ... 
I can still make amends.

698
01:33:26,981 --> 01:33:30,443
How?

699
01:33:40,245 --> 01:33:46,376
- Nelson? 
- Joe, I've got to borrow your car.

700
01:33:48,962 --> 01:33:52,716
Nelson, wait.

701
01:33:58,513 --> 01:34:00,765
My God !

702
01:34:35,342 --> 01:34:40,889
Hello. 
What? Where?

703
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

704
01:34:54,819 --> 01:34:58,948
Nelson freaked out. 
Joe and Steckle are stranded.

705
01:34:59,115 --> 01:35:02,160
- Will you be all right alone? 
- Yeah.

706
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:48,576
Daddy.

707
01:37:51,705 --> 01:37:55,041
Rachel.

708
01:37:55,917 --> 01:37:59,129
Sweetheart ...

709
01:38:01,589 --> 01:38:05,010
I'm sorry.

710
01:38:09,305 --> 01:38:13,518
Forgive me.

711
01:38:48,386 --> 01:38:54,225
Billy Mahoney died 17 years ago,
and Nelson feels responsible.

712
01:38:54,392 --> 01:39:00,023
- Do you know where he went? 
- He ran off to make amends.

713
01:39:00,190 --> 01:39:04,194
- You think he'd try to flatline? 
- Alone? That would be suicide.

714
01:39:17,582 --> 01:39:21,878
- David? 
- No, it's Nelson.

715
01:39:22,045 --> 01:39:25,006
David's out trying to find you.

716
01:39:25,173 --> 01:39:31,805
I wanted to say I was sorry. 
Please, tell David.

717
01:39:31,971 --> 01:39:38,645
- l'm sorry l got you into this. 
- No, none of that matters now.

718
01:39:43,108 --> 01:39:48,279
Rachel, everything matters. 
Everything we do matters.

719
01:39:49,489 --> 01:39:53,243
- That's why I'm going under again. 
- No, Nelson, wait.

720
01:39:53,410 --> 01:39:58,873
- Tell me where you are. 
- I really am sorry.

721
01:40:25,817 --> 01:40:29,154
- It's payback for our arrogance. 
- Save it.

722
01:41:03,229 --> 01:41:09,861
It's a good thing I didn't flatline. 
I used to tease my fat babysitter.

723
01:41:18,036 --> 01:41:21,831
Okay, Billy Mahoney, come on.

724
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

725
01:43:03,808 --> 01:43:08,855
- Body temperature down to 78% . 
- He used potassium !

726
01:43:12,650 --> 01:43:17,447
Joe, electrodes! 
300. Clear.

727
01:43:20,742 --> 01:43:25,163
- Nothing. 
- We have to go again. Clear.

728
01:43:35,674 --> 01:43:39,052
Go up to 360. Clear!

729
01:43:39,219 --> 01:43:45,350
- I can't hear anything. 
- He called. It's been nine minutes.

730
01:43:45,517 --> 01:43:47,769
Iet's intubate.

731
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:56,069
I can't get it in. 
His trachea's too tight.

732
01:44:01,366 --> 01:44:04,703
Stop, Billy!

733
01:44:17,465 --> 01:44:22,429
- Nothing. 
- Get me 4mg of atropine ready.

734
01:44:31,062 --> 01:44:35,066
- David ... 
- Atropine intratracheal.

735
01:44:35,233 --> 01:44:42,365
- This is a truckload, Dave. 
- This has got to work. Come on.

736
01:44:48,163 --> 01:44:51,374
- Come on, Nelson. 
- He's been dead ten minutes.

737
01:44:51,541 --> 01:44:56,296
- He's not in v-fib. 
- Eppy intracardial.

738
01:44:56,463 --> 01:44:59,591
Just do it!

739
01:45:02,427 --> 01:45:05,430
No!

740
01:45:05,597 --> 01:45:08,600
Don't do it, Billy!

741
01:45:08,767 --> 01:45:12,395
I'm sorry!

742
01:45:39,714 --> 01:45:40,965
Starting CPR !

743
01:45:40,965 --> 01:45:42,467
Starting CPR !

744
01:45:43,843 --> 01:45:46,680
It's been 12 minutes! He is dead.

745
01:45:46,846 --> 01:45:49,641
Breathe!

746
01:45:52,894 --> 01:45:56,272
Forget about it. We lost him.

747
01:45:56,439 --> 01:45:59,359
Dave, stop it!

748
01:45:59,526 --> 01:46:03,405
Stop, David.

749
01:46:03,571 --> 01:46:07,534
David, stop it!

750
01:46:07,701 --> 01:46:10,995
Iet him go.

751
01:46:25,510 --> 01:46:30,473
- We're all responsible for this. 
- Maybe we deserve this.

752
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:35,020
No. 
It's not fair and it's not right.

753
01:46:35,186 --> 01:46:40,942
I'm sorry, God ! I'm sorry we stepped
on your fucking territory!

754
01:46:41,109 --> 01:46:45,488
I'm sorry! lsn't that enough?

755
01:46:49,367 --> 01:46:54,914
- Apparently not. 
- I'll call the police.

756
01:46:57,542 --> 01:47:04,132
I could hear it in his voice on the
phone. He felt he deserved to die.

757
01:47:04,341 --> 01:47:10,513
Bullshit! It was a mistake. 
He was just a little kid.

758
01:47:11,139 --> 01:47:14,559
He doesn't deserve to die!

759
01:48:21,418 --> 01:48:24,963
Come on, Nelson !

760
01:48:30,093 --> 01:48:34,305
- Clear ... 
- No, wait!

761
01:48:37,642 --> 01:48:40,854
I've got a pulse. 
We've fucking got him !

762
01:48:41,021 --> 01:48:46,151
- Come on, pick up the beat. 
- Easy, don't rush him.

763
01:48:46,317 --> 01:48:52,157
- Pick up the beat. 
- Don't rush him.

764
01:48:58,955 --> 01:49:01,958
That's it.

765
01:49:12,510 --> 01:49:17,390
Hail Mary, praise Jesus,
and all that stuff.

766
01:49:17,557 --> 01:49:23,730
- Hi, don't try to talk. 
- I've got to get this on tape.

767
01:49:40,830 --> 01:49:43,208
He said ...

768
01:49:45,543 --> 01:49:49,339
He said it wasn't
such a good day to die.

769
01:50:02,185 --> 01:50:04,229
Thank you.

770
01:50:04,229 --> 01:50:05,897
Thank you.

771
