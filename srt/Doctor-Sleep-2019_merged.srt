00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,606
Where you going, Violet?

3
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:47,675
Just to pick some flowers.

4
00:00:47,677 --> 00:00:49,679
Don't wander too far.

00:00:56,385 --> 00:01:01,955

10
00:01:20,043 --> 00:01:21,677
Well, hi there.

11
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:26,248
Do you want one?

12
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:38,327
You're wondering why
I'm wearing such a funny hat.

13
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:42,329
I always wear this hat.

14
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:44,965
So much,
it's a part of my name now.

15
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:46,734
My friends,

16
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:48,702
my very, very best friends,

17
00:01:48,704 --> 00:01:51,371
they just call me
Rose the Hat.

18
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:54,408
It looks like
a magician's hat.

19
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,044
It is.

20
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:58,712
It's a magic hat.

21
00:01:58,714 --> 00:01:59,749
Do you wanna see?

22
00:02:01,684 --> 00:02:03,319
Nothing up my sleeves.

23
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:07,055
Nothing in my hat.

24
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,525
Don't worry, that's my friend.

25
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:12,960
You're missing the trick.

26
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:14,897
Reach inside.

27
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:21,401
Wow!

28
00:02:21,403 --> 00:02:22,603
It's so pretty.

29
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:24,404
Because it's special.

30
00:02:24,406 --> 00:02:26,440
And speaking of special,

31
00:02:26,442 --> 00:02:28,577
you're a little magic, too,
aren't you?

32
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:33,382
The flower in my hand,
what color is it?

33
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:36,952
Purple.

34
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:44,326
Violet,

35
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,562
like you.

36
00:02:49,398 --> 00:02:50,998
You don't eat flowers.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,499
But you do.

38
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,701
But these are special.

39
00:02:54,703 --> 00:02:58,641
Honey, it's the special ones
that taste best.

40
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:03,610
I should get back to my mom.

41
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:06,549
No, stay. Stay awhile.
See more magic.

42
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,420
- Ow.
- You are a special

43
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:14,824
little thing, aren't you?

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

45
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

46
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:02,858
No, no, no. Please.

47
00:06:07,063 --> 00:06:09,498
Hey. It's okay, Doc.

48
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:12,268
It's okay.

49
00:06:17,906 --> 00:06:19,340
There.

50
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:21,077
All dry.

51
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:25,881
What happened?

52
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:31,020
You have to talk to me, Danny.

53
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:34,823
You haven't talked
since we left...

54
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:38,061
Please, Doc.

55
00:06:39,762 --> 00:06:41,663
Please.

56
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:57,211
So,

57
00:06:57,213 --> 00:06:59,848
you ain't talking, huh, Doc?

58
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:07,656
Weren't talking much
first time I met you neither.

59
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:12,659
You remember the first time
we really talked?

60
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:16,197
When I spoke up
inside your head?

61
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,632
<i>Made you feel good, right?</i>

62
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:21,169
<i>Knowing you weren't alone.</i>

63
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:24,138
Someone did that for me, too.

64
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,376
And some day, Danny Torrance,
you'll teach someone else.

65
00:07:28,378 --> 00:07:29,778
I won't.

66
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:31,945
Oh, you won't, huh?

67
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:33,647
I won't shine, I mean.

68
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:37,051
No more. It's dangerous.

69
00:07:37,053 --> 00:07:39,753
Reckon it is sometimes.

70
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:41,255
She found me.

71
00:07:41,257 --> 00:07:43,992
She'll come back and come back
until she gets me.

72
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:46,793
You're right.

73
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:49,097
The Overlook's condemned.
Boarded up.

74
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:50,897
They're starvin' old ghosts,

75
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,966
and they're reachin' out
for you.

76
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:55,069
Won't stop with her, either.

77
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:56,903
Pictures in a book.

78
00:07:56,905 --> 00:07:58,872
You said they were just
pictures in a book

79
00:07:58,874 --> 00:07:59,975
and they couldn't hurt me.

80
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:04,845
Some things,

81
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:08,982
dark things,
the shining's like food.

82
00:08:08,984 --> 00:08:10,884
The Overlook,

83
00:08:10,886 --> 00:08:14,754
it was always just pictures
to me.

84
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:18,059
But I didn't shine like you.

85
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:21,262
Nobody shines like you.

86
00:08:21,264 --> 00:08:23,431
So, you in that damn hotel,

87
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:26,134
you was like
a million-watt battery

88
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:27,767
all plugged in.

89
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:29,905
And it ate it up.

90
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:35,109
World's a hungry place.

91
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:37,044
And the darkest things
are the hungriest,

92
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:39,113
and they'll eat what shines.

93
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:42,749
Swarm it like mosquitoes
or leeches.

94
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,155
Can't do nothing about that.

95
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:49,423
What you can do

96
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:53,096
is turn what they come for
against 'em.

97
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:58,798
My grandfather,

98
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,737
he was a mean son of a bitch.

99
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:04,238
Dark inside.

100
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,074
Same type of dark as your dad.

101
00:09:07,076 --> 00:09:10,010
Beat me senseless,
and my grandma, too,

102
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:12,246
and when he died, I danced.

103
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:14,917
But he kept on coming back.

104
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:18,352
Standing in my room.

105
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:21,189
Suit all gray and stinkin'

106
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:25,226
from whatever mold was growin'
on him in that box.

107
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:26,995
So, Grandma,

108
00:09:29,865 --> 00:09:32,235
she taught me a trick.

109
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,804
Gave me a present.

110
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:41,244
I want you to know this box

111
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:44,078
inside and out.

112
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,381
Don't just look at it.
Touch it.

113
00:09:47,383 --> 00:09:50,518
Stick your nose inside
and see if there's a smell.

114
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,353
Why?

115
00:09:52,355 --> 00:09:56,057
Because you're gonna build one
just like it in your mind.

116
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:58,159
One even more special.

117
00:09:58,161 --> 00:10:00,729
So next time
that bitch comes around,

118
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:02,831
you'll be ready.

119
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,934
Let's get you back to Mama.

120
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:08,835
Danny!

121
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:10,739
Danny!

122
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:15,176
Danny!

123
00:10:15,178 --> 00:10:17,245
There you are.

124
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:19,415
Where did you go, huh?

125
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,319
You scared me half to death.

126
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,887
Don't you do that to me.
You hear?

127
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:30,291
Don't you ever do that to me.

128
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:32,295
Don't ever do that to me.

129
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:42,203
<i>Eh, what's up, Doc?</i>

130
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:44,071
<i>What's the bit?</i>

131
00:10:44,073 --> 00:10:47,141
<i>What's cookin'?</i>

132
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:50,378
<i>What's cooking,
little friend? Why, you are.</i>

133
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,512
<i>Me?</i>

134
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:54,250
<i>Why, yes.</i>

135
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:59,155
<i>Ouch!
You're killing me!</i>

136
00:11:00,556 --> 00:11:01,823
<i>Ouch!</i>

137
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:10,099
<i>Agony! Agony!</i>

138
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

139
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:50,237
<i>Let me see now.</i>

140
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:53,374
<i>It is obvious that this
is no ordinary rabbit.</i>

141
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:55,076
<i>Therefore, I must dream up</i>

142
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:57,545
<i>a brilliant master strategy,
ingenious...</i>

143
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:58,978
You okay, Doc?

144
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,615
<i>Now, what if I lured him...</i>

145
00:12:01,617 --> 00:12:03,684
- Yeah, Mom. I'm okay.
- <i>...into a rock crusher?</i>

146
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:06,019
<i>Nah, nah, nah,
too complicated.</i>

147
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:10,091
<i>Yeah, yeah, too
complicated. But what if I...</i>

148
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:11,592
<i>Too much detail.</i>

149
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:13,563
<i>Right.
Too much detail.</i>

150
00:12:33,014 --> 00:12:34,081
<i>And what's your name</i>

151
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,449
- again, cutie?
- Dan.

152
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:37,553
<i>Dan.</i>

153
00:13:12,722 --> 00:13:17,158
You're gonna take
your medicine.

154
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,225
Get off him.

155
00:13:18,227 --> 00:13:19,760
Get up. Get out of here.

156
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:22,363
Shit.
I think you killed him.

157
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:24,465
What if you killed him?

158
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,133
I hope you killed him.

159
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:27,670
You hear me?

160
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:30,706
Let me kiss it better.

161
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:42,183
No, no, no.

162
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:44,618
No, no, no.

163
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,088
Whoa. What the... No.

164
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:13,416
Mommy?

165
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,625
- Mommy?
- Baby.

166
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:27,029
Here, here.

167
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:36,303
<i>You can
put her money back, Doc.</i>

168
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:38,639
<i>You can do that much.</i>

169
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:40,674
She took mine.

170
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:43,011
She probably bought
the coke with it.

171
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:45,181

<i>...before he'll let

182
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,724
<i>This sort of takes the
sting out of being occupied.</i>

183
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:32,526
You're prettier

00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:33,561
- <i>Doesn't it, Mr. Richard?</i>
- <i>You said it.</i>

185
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:35,698
And you're older than yours.

186
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,604
Are we staying here
or going somewhere?

187
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,108
Don't you wanna
watch the movie?

188
00:15:59,155 --> 00:16:00,854
I don't see
what the fuss is about.

189
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:02,289
Chat room romance.

190
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,758
Little gross. Not interesting.

191
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,761
Just watch.
It's interesting, I promise.

192
00:16:07,763 --> 00:16:08,862
Well, it better be,

193
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:10,764
'cause she's not
all that steamy.

194
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:13,701
And there she goes.

195
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:15,705
Aren't you tired?

196
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:18,708
Sleep.

197
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:31,721
Okay.

198
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:40,961
Wait. This is the best part.

199
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:42,663
I watched her do it
three times now

200
00:16:42,665 --> 00:16:43,666
and it never gets old.

201
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:47,368
Sleep deeper,

202
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,270
deep as you can.

203
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:53,609
The pain you feel
is only a dream.

204
00:16:55,878 --> 00:16:59,913
You can explain
a lost wallet

205
00:16:59,915 --> 00:17:02,850
when your wife asks.

206
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:05,521
But you can't explain this.

207
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:08,255
This you'll see

208
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:11,525
every day
when you look in the mirror.

209
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:13,994
And every time you see it,

210
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:16,832
you'll say out loud...

211
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:19,702
"I like little girls."

212
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:25,406
And the next time
you go looking

213
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:27,541
for a little girl online,

214
00:17:27,543 --> 00:17:30,711
I want you to remember
that time

215
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:34,250
you got bitten
by a rattlesnake.

216
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:43,893
- That is interesting.
- Mmm-hmm.

217
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:55,769
Excuse me, miss?

218
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:58,572
Miss. Miss, you left something
in the theater.

219
00:17:58,574 --> 00:17:59,608
You wanna leave me alone.

220
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:09,752
Well, hi there.

221
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:12,221
You wanna let me go.

222
00:18:13,723 --> 00:18:15,891
Oh, no, sweetie.

223
00:18:16,726 --> 00:18:19,261
No, I don't.

224
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:10,410
Mommy, I made this for you.
It's a secret card.

225
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:12,579
Thank you, Abba-doo.

226
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:15,451
Does anyone know a magic word?

227
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:18,952
Hmm. You.

228
00:19:18,954 --> 00:19:20,554
Abracadabra.

229
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:22,389
Abracadabra.
That's a great one.

230
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:25,359
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

231
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:28,829
Abracadabra.

232
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:30,731
I know magic, too.

233
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,399
Sometimes, if I...

234
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:35,736
Sorry.

235
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:38,039
Has anyone seen my spoons?

236
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,807
I can do that.

237
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,608
That's nice, sweetie.

238
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,678
- They're on you!
- Oh, they're on me?

239
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:50,386
What the hell?

240
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:00,796
Dave...

241
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:15,078
Abracadabra.

242
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:53,081
Oops.

243
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,149
Well, hi there, sleepyhead.

244
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:56,884
Sorry.

245
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:59,453
I had to sleep you
pretty hard.

246
00:20:59,455 --> 00:21:01,222
You're a tough one.

247
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:02,823
Willful.

248
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:04,691
You know, I checked.

249
00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:07,228
Six men in three months

250
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,631
with those little snakebite
tattoos on their cheeks.

251
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:12,601
Why, you've been busy.

252
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:22,976
Snakebite Andi,
that's who you are.

253
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:25,414
So, who am I?

254
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:30,617
You're some crazy bitch
who kidnapped me.

255
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:32,220
Just the truth from now on.

256
00:21:32,222 --> 00:21:34,690
You will only speak the truth.

257
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,527
You're the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

258
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:41,862
My God.

259
00:21:41,864 --> 00:21:44,232
Works a little too well,
don't it?

260
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:47,101
Here's the deal,
Snakebite Andi.

261
00:21:47,103 --> 00:21:50,837
You're a pusher. Hmm?
You can push people.

262
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:54,108
We haven't had a pusher
around here for a little while

263
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,610
so I'm gonna offer you a deal
I haven't offered anyone

264
00:21:56,612 --> 00:21:59,713
in almost 40 years.

265
00:21:59,715 --> 00:22:02,518
How old are you, darlin'?

266
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,851
Fifteen.

267
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:06,687
Fifteen?

268
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:09,923
Oh, God, what an age.

269
00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:13,027
Springtime of your womanhood,
isn't it?

270
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:14,228
Mmm.

271
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,030
You're not a girl anymore,

272
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:19,800
but you don't have
a single dent yet either.

273
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:22,836
Gravity hasn't even
noticed you.

274
00:22:22,838 --> 00:22:24,740
Not at 15.

275
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:27,476
Men, though...

276
00:22:28,677 --> 00:22:30,146
No, no, no. No shame.

277
00:22:31,714 --> 00:22:36,050
You paid that back,
didn't you?

278
00:22:36,052 --> 00:22:39,853
That's what I'm offering you.
Springtime forever.

279
00:22:39,855 --> 00:22:42,090
Ten years from now,
you're still 15.

280
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:44,660
A hundred, maybe 17.

281
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:47,828
Eat well,

282
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,168
stay young, live long.

283
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:03,670
You like it?

284
00:24:03,672 --> 00:24:05,206
Oh. Sorry. I was just...

285
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:08,642
That's okay.
People love to look at it.

286
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:10,744
We used to set this up
in the library.

287
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:13,947
Community project, just taking
a life all its own.

288
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:16,117
See, we started with
the clock tower there.

289
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,953
- Oh, yeah.
- Just keeps growing.

290
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:20,121
Kids call it Teenytown.

291
00:24:20,123 --> 00:24:21,755
The kids build this?

292
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:23,224
With some help, oh, yeah.

293
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:26,096
Keep it up,
build the whole town square.

294
00:24:27,963 --> 00:24:32,066
Are you off the bus
or riding your thumb?

295
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:33,401
Yeah, the bus.

296
00:24:33,403 --> 00:24:36,104
Oh. Not many ride the bus
this far north.

297
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:39,309
Unless they're looking
for work.

298
00:24:41,444 --> 00:24:43,113
Yeah.

299
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,214
Change of scenery,

300
00:24:46,216 --> 00:24:48,784
or you running away
from something?

301
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:52,018
Don't mind me.
I hope I'm...

302
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,154
New face is all.

303
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:54,788
Yeah.

304
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,793
Guess I'm running away
from myself, I guess.

305
00:24:58,394 --> 00:25:01,162
Oh, yeah.

306
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:04,998
Running away from yourself.
That is a pickle.

307
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,801
You take yourself
with you wherever you go.

308
00:25:07,803 --> 00:25:11,771
- Ain't that the bitch?
- Mmm-hmm.

309
00:25:11,773 --> 00:25:13,107
<i>Rent's 85 a week,</i>

310
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:14,475
payable up front.

311
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:17,978
Billy paid your first two,
rest's on you.

312
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,848
No pets, no parties, no noise.

313
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,318
I'm a quiet tenant.

314
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,456
Last guy said the same.
Math student.

315
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:30,358
Even let him paint the wall
all blackboard,

316
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,427
so he could scribble his
little puzzles up there.

317
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:36,264
Wasn't quiet. No, sir.

318
00:25:36,266 --> 00:25:38,232
Didn't even paint over this
when he left,

319
00:25:38,234 --> 00:25:39,766
but I'm glad he didn't

320
00:25:39,768 --> 00:25:42,136
'cause I can make this easy
for ya,

321
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:44,140
so you see it every morning
when you wake.

322
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,410
You sure you wanna vouch
for this pup?

323
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:50,944
Pretty sure.

324
00:25:50,946 --> 00:25:52,315
It's your ass, Billy.

325
00:25:53,316 --> 00:25:55,285
Bleedin' heart, this one.

326
00:25:57,886 --> 00:26:01,255
I'm downstairs, ground floor,
if you need anything.

327
00:26:01,257 --> 00:26:03,992
Find me tomorrow,
talk about some work.

328
00:26:05,328 --> 00:26:07,528
Why are you doing this?

329
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,163
You don't know me.

330
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:11,098
No, I don't.

331
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,934
But I know the look,
like I said.

332
00:26:13,936 --> 00:26:17,471
And sometimes I get
this feeling about people.

333
00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:19,275
Hard to understand, I guess.

334
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:22,245
Easier than you think.

335
00:26:23,845 --> 00:26:25,448
- Thanks.
- All right.

336
00:26:46,802 --> 00:26:48,037
You ready?

337
00:26:50,506 --> 00:26:51,940
She's ready.

338
00:26:57,146 --> 00:26:58,479
Who are these people?

339
00:26:58,481 --> 00:27:01,182
You'll find out after.

340
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:03,117
That over there
is Grampa Flick,

341
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:05,188
and he'll lead us.
Lie down.

342
00:27:05,854 --> 00:27:07,257
There.

343
00:27:11,427 --> 00:27:15,263
No fear.
You understand?

344
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:26,040
We are the True Knot

345
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:28,175
and we endure.

346
00:27:30,413 --> 00:27:32,513
We are the chosen ones.

347
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:37,884
We are the fortunate ones.

348
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:45,028
What is tied cannot be untied.

349
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,364
Here is a woman.

350
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:52,168
Would she join us?

351
00:27:54,002 --> 00:27:59,140
Would she tie
her life to our life?

352
00:27:59,142 --> 00:28:00,241
Yes.

353
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:01,941
Yes.

354
00:28:01,943 --> 00:28:04,946
Say yes.

355
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:07,417
Yes.

356
00:28:09,052 --> 00:28:11,985
This one's special.

357
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:13,521
Her name's Violet.

358
00:28:13,523 --> 00:28:15,258
There's not much of her left.

359
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:18,894
And she tastes...

360
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:23,066
like flowers.

361
00:28:44,487 --> 00:28:46,587
Breathe deep.

362
00:28:54,497 --> 00:28:58,101
There. Embrace it.

363
00:29:00,969 --> 00:29:02,871
Embrace it.

364
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:15,318
No!

365
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,321
No! No!

366
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

367
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:09,372
They haven't found us yet.

368
00:30:11,274 --> 00:30:13,441
They were used to
hearing him cry

369
00:30:13,443 --> 00:30:16,078
'cause I left him alone
so much.

370
00:30:18,648 --> 00:30:20,550
So they didn't do anything.

371
00:30:23,553 --> 00:30:26,420
And they haven't found us yet.

372
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:35,364
Mommy?

373
00:30:55,585 --> 00:30:57,818
Oh, hey.

374
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,255
Uh, you said
that you knew my look.

375
00:31:01,257 --> 00:31:02,991
Well, what did you mean?

376
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:06,327
You're sick.

377
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:08,631
You're tired.
I can see that much.

378
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,401
I need help.

379
00:31:16,272 --> 00:31:18,105
Come on in.

380
00:31:18,107 --> 00:31:19,509
We'll talk about it.

381
00:31:22,612 --> 00:31:24,678
<i>God, grant me the serenity</i>

382
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,548
<i>to accept the things
I cannot change,</i>

383
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,783
the courage
to change the things I can

384
00:31:29,785 --> 00:31:32,620
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

385
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:34,588
Well, Bobbie's got
a big birthday today.

386
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,190
Three years.
Three years sober.

387
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,493
Yeah.

388
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:41,295
Thanks, John.

389
00:31:41,297 --> 00:31:43,130
Well, now for the most
important person in the room.

390
00:31:43,132 --> 00:31:46,035
Is, uh, anybody here a newbie?

391
00:31:47,503 --> 00:31:50,039
Somebody got 24 hours?

392
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:53,609
Yeah.

393
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,117
<i>New to town, huh?</i>

394
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,518
Yeah, I, uh...

395
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,886
Nothing personal.

396
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,321
I delivered half the people
in the room.

397
00:32:07,323 --> 00:32:08,322
Just new faces pop,
that's all.

398
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:09,456
This here is Dan Torrance.

399
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,358
- He's fresh off the bus.
- Oh, hey.

400
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,796
Fresh off the ground,
by the look.

401
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:15,696
Oh.

402
00:32:15,698 --> 00:32:17,665
There's no judgment here,
brother.

403
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:19,166
I mean, we've all been there.

404
00:32:19,168 --> 00:32:21,168
- And worse, trust me.
- Oh, yeah.

405
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,437
If you're looking
for a wing to climb under,

406
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:24,605
I can't say
you'll do any better

407
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:26,574
than Billy Freeman here.

408
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:29,111
Thank you
for your hospitality. I...

409
00:32:29,812 --> 00:32:32,446
I'm a little, uh...

410
00:32:32,448 --> 00:32:34,481
I guess I'm not used to it.

411
00:32:34,483 --> 00:32:36,350
Well, you know we say,

412
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,918
"You can't judge someone till
you know their whole story."

413
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,453
You might think
you understand,

414
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:42,289
- but you don't.
- You don't.

415
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:43,657
So, how are you today?
All right?

416
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:45,192
Train's still running.

417
00:32:45,194 --> 00:32:47,194
That's good to hear.

418
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:48,362
You good?

419
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:50,664
Yeah. Yeah.

420
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:51,932
Well, good to know you, Dan.

421
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:53,400
- Yeah.
- Come again.

422
00:32:53,402 --> 00:32:54,568
- Thanks.
- Hope to see you again soon.

423
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,171
I'll come back, yeah.

424
00:32:57,173 --> 00:32:59,840
Really good man.
He's got a gift...

425
00:32:59,842 --> 00:33:01,675
Yeah. Hey, Billy, hang on.

426
00:33:01,677 --> 00:33:03,446
Hey, Doc.

427
00:33:04,947 --> 00:33:07,815
Your watch. Uh...

428
00:33:07,817 --> 00:33:10,918
You lost your watch. You were
worried about the kid with...

429
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,822
Goocher's.

430
00:33:14,423 --> 00:33:16,190
What?

431
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:20,262
The kid with Goocher's
or Gaucher's. The bone thing.

432
00:33:22,765 --> 00:33:24,632
Gaucher's disease.

433
00:33:24,634 --> 00:33:26,400
Right.

434
00:33:26,402 --> 00:33:27,735
You were washing your hands
in the hospital bathroom

435
00:33:27,737 --> 00:33:29,472
and you left it
on the soap dispenser.

436
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:35,309
Well, just check
on the soap dispenser.

437
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:37,446
- It's good to meet you.
- Yeah.

438
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:44,153
How did you know?

439
00:33:45,354 --> 00:33:47,423
I wish I could say. Uh...

440
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:50,426
Lucky guess.

441
00:33:53,295 --> 00:33:54,630
My ass.

442
00:33:55,564 --> 00:33:57,297
Intuition, I suppose.

443
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:59,502
Like a feeling in my gut.
Maybe a...

444
00:34:01,303 --> 00:34:03,303
A lucky guess.

445
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:05,207
What do you wanna do here?

446
00:34:06,475 --> 00:34:07,808
What do you mean?

447
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,713
I mean here in Frazier.
Why are you here?

448
00:34:12,682 --> 00:34:14,715
I don't know. I don't know.

449
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:18,320
Something different
than I've been doing.

450
00:34:19,689 --> 00:34:21,557
Something better.

451
00:34:24,827 --> 00:34:26,595
You go to church?

452
00:34:27,396 --> 00:34:28,762
Does it matter?

453
00:34:28,764 --> 00:34:30,800
Do you believe in something?
Something...

454
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:34,370
bigger than you?

455
00:34:36,305 --> 00:34:39,506
Our beliefs
don't make us better people.

456
00:34:39,508 --> 00:34:41,877
Our actions
make us better people.

457
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:46,647
So, Billy says
you have orderly experience.

458
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:48,382
That's right.

459
00:34:48,384 --> 00:34:49,917
You workin' right now?

460
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,554
A few shifts at Teenytown.
Helping with the train.

461
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:54,788
'Cause I do three days a week

462
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,924
at Rivington House,
the hospice.

463
00:34:56,926 --> 00:34:59,027
Good orderly is tough to find.

464
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:00,463
Tougher to keep.

465
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:03,897
Do dying people bother you?

466
00:35:03,899 --> 00:35:05,666
No.

467
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:07,301
We're all dying.

468
00:35:07,303 --> 00:35:10,404
The world is one big hospice
with fresh air.

469
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:11,640
Hmm.

470
00:35:53,949 --> 00:35:54,950
Wow.

471
00:35:55,885 --> 00:35:58,354
Well, hi there.

472
00:35:59,355 --> 00:36:00,823
You said it didn't hurt.

473
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,060
Doesn't now, does it?

474
00:36:06,062 --> 00:36:07,897
Felt like I was dying.

475
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:10,597
I know.

476
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:11,934
You did.

477
00:36:13,136 --> 00:36:15,103
You'll feel better
when you eat.

478
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:16,839
Am I still human?

479
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:20,476
Do you care?

480
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,339
Hey. Let him be.

481
00:36:52,007 --> 00:36:54,044
Azreel, leave him be.

482
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:05,788
Azzie?

483
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:08,058
Azzie, come on.

484
00:37:08,991 --> 00:37:11,892
Come on. Azzie.

485
00:37:11,894 --> 00:37:13,063
Doc.

486
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,030
That you, Doc?

487
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:17,731
No, I'm not a doctor.

488
00:37:17,733 --> 00:37:19,933
Do you want me
to get you a doctor?

489
00:37:19,935 --> 00:37:21,501
The cat's on my bed.

490
00:37:21,503 --> 00:37:22,970
Oh, hey, I'll move her.

491
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:24,471
No.

492
00:37:24,473 --> 00:37:26,740
I knew she would be.

493
00:37:26,742 --> 00:37:30,846
That cat
always seems to know...

494
00:37:32,715 --> 00:37:34,450
when it's time.

495
00:37:35,985 --> 00:37:38,652
- I guess it's time.
- No.

496
00:37:38,654 --> 00:37:41,189
It's just Azzie
being a silly old cat.

497
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:43,523
Nope.

498
00:37:43,525 --> 00:37:45,928
Been that way
ever since I got here.

499
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:48,996
The cat knows

500
00:37:48,998 --> 00:37:51,465
when it's time to go to sleep.

501
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:53,569
Everybody knows that.

502
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,073
I'm gonna die.

503
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,850
Yes.

504
00:38:09,852 --> 00:38:11,018
Let me get you someone.

505
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,389
No.

506
00:38:14,023 --> 00:38:16,959
Known it was comin'.

507
00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:21,095
Doesn't make it less scary.

508
00:38:21,097 --> 00:38:22,829
Yeah.

509
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:25,033
But maybe
it's just like you say,

510
00:38:25,035 --> 00:38:27,968
just going to sleep.

511
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:31,805
I mean, there's nothing scary.
It's just sleeping.

512
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:33,974
You're a strange
type of doctor.

513
00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:35,876
I told you, I'm not a doctor.

514
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:37,746
Oh, I think you are.

515
00:38:38,647 --> 00:38:40,714
Doctor Sleep.

516
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:44,252
Doc, I am so scared
it's gonna hurt, or be dark,

517
00:38:44,254 --> 00:38:47,121
or be nothing at all.
And I don't wanna...

518
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:49,125
<i>Nothing to be scared of.</i>

519
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,094
<i>Just going to sleep.</i>

520
00:38:53,096 --> 00:38:57,800
<i>Finally, true, restful sleep.</i>

521
00:39:01,937 --> 00:39:03,572
Oh, thank you.

522
00:39:04,707 --> 00:39:07,975
Thank you, Doc.

523
00:39:07,977 --> 00:39:10,711
Look, I shouldn't be here.
Let me go get you some...

524
00:39:10,713 --> 00:39:12,046
No, no, no.

525
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:15,951
You're exactly
where you should be.

526
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:19,788
Exactly.

527
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,727
I see my wife.

528
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:04,825
Dan, alcoholic.

529
00:41:04,827 --> 00:41:06,427
Hi, Dan.

530
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:08,995
I'm not much of a speech guy.

531
00:41:08,997 --> 00:41:10,264
I just thought
I'd hold the chip

532
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:12,868
and talk about
whatever popped up.

533
00:41:14,002 --> 00:41:16,206
And I'm thinkin' about my dad.

534
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,972
He died when I was five,

535
00:41:18,974 --> 00:41:21,042
so the only way
I got to know him,

536
00:41:21,044 --> 00:41:25,246
really got to know him,
was when I went dark.

537
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:29,119
When I drank to dull the,

538
00:41:29,952 --> 00:41:32,018
or, uh,

539
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,388
whenever I wanted
to break someone's face,

540
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,024
'cause the drinking

541
00:41:37,026 --> 00:41:39,293
and the temper and the anger,

542
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:41,129
those things in me were his.

543
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,133
And they were
all I could know of him.

544
00:41:45,968 --> 00:41:51,472
But now, well, now I get to
know him a little different,

545
00:41:51,474 --> 00:41:55,143
'cause he also stood
in a room like this once

546
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:59,815
wanting to get well
for me and my mom.

547
00:42:01,384 --> 00:42:03,884
And he held the chip
in his hand,

548
00:42:03,886 --> 00:42:06,187
and the chip said five months

549
00:42:06,189 --> 00:42:08,889
and on that day, he...

550
00:42:08,891 --> 00:42:10,659
Before it all...

551
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:14,861
Well, on that day,
all he wanted in the world

552
00:42:14,863 --> 00:42:16,999
was to stand
where I'm standing now.

553
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:20,136
And here I am,

554
00:42:21,803 --> 00:42:24,440
so thank you for us both,
I guess.

555
00:42:25,475 --> 00:42:27,441
This is for Jack Torrance.

556
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,128
Hey, Charlie.

557
00:42:48,864 --> 00:42:49,865
Doc?

558
00:42:52,868 --> 00:42:58,472
Guess I don't need to ask
why you're here at this hour.

559
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:02,443
Do you have pain?

560
00:43:02,445 --> 00:43:05,013
Do you want me to get
Claudette to bring you a pill?

561
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:08,151
Pill won't matter.

562
00:43:09,985 --> 00:43:14,055
I'm not scared of hell, Doc.

563
00:43:14,057 --> 00:43:18,792
I lived a decent life.

564
00:43:18,794 --> 00:43:21,962
I don't think there is
such a place anyway.

565
00:43:21,964 --> 00:43:23,865
I guess I'm scared...

566
00:43:25,368 --> 00:43:28,802
there's nothing.

567
00:43:28,804 --> 00:43:30,839
We don't end, Charlie.

568
00:43:31,574 --> 00:43:33,907
I know that for certain.

569
00:43:33,909 --> 00:43:35,877
I don't know much else,

570
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,415
but I know that we don't end.

571
00:43:41,517 --> 00:43:43,317
Blueberries.

572
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:49,223
I can taste blueberries
my mother used to grow.

573
00:43:49,225 --> 00:43:51,058
Can you taste them?

574
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,029
Yeah, I can.

575
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:57,998
And I can hear Frank
on your old radio.

576
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,467
The one you used to have
on your workbench

577
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:02,303
next to your tools.

578
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:04,605

579
00:44:04,607 --> 00:44:08,509

585
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:38,441
Been a minute, little pen pal.

586
00:44:51,887 --> 00:44:56,424
Abra? School.

587
00:44:56,426 --> 00:44:58,561
Fine, I know.

588
00:45:16,978 --> 00:45:19,146
Hey, Gramps, you seen Rosie?

589
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:21,084
Watchtower.

590
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:25,086
You feelin' okay?

591
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:27,321
Peachy keen.

592
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:47,043
Hey.

593
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,077
Sorry to interrupt.

594
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,213
Any luck?

595
00:45:52,215 --> 00:45:54,281
- Gettin' closer.
- Hmm.

596
00:45:54,283 --> 00:45:57,118
He's somewhere in Iowa,
I think.

597
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,186
We'll all take
a nice long road trip

598
00:45:59,188 --> 00:46:01,090
once I'm sure I've found him.

599
00:46:03,959 --> 00:46:06,093
Until I do, we...

600
00:46:06,095 --> 00:46:09,063
You gotta open
a canister, Rosie.

601
00:46:09,065 --> 00:46:10,664
We took steam
six months ago, Crow.

602
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:12,666
Six months is nothing.

603
00:46:12,668 --> 00:46:15,069
That kid in Delaware
wasn't so steamy

604
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:16,637
and it's already showing.

605
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:18,606
You see
Grampa Flick's hair, yeah?

606
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:20,074
Yeah.

607
00:46:20,076 --> 00:46:21,642
I don't think he's well.

608
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:24,345
Grampa Flick hasn't been well
since Nixon was in office.

609
00:46:24,347 --> 00:46:26,547
I know.

610
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:29,519
But we need to eat.
All of us.

611
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:33,053
Are the canisters low?

612
00:46:33,055 --> 00:46:34,588
Course not.

613
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:38,027
Just no need to waste one
if you're close to the kill.

614
00:46:39,495 --> 00:46:41,028
- Rosie.
- Mmm-hmm?

615
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:43,533
I might need it
just to find him.

616
00:46:47,336 --> 00:46:49,069
There used to be more steam
in the world, you know?

617
00:46:49,071 --> 00:46:50,738
Oh, don't be daft. Come on.

618
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,473
That's like when rubes say,

619
00:46:52,475 --> 00:46:54,675
"50 years ago, people used to
be more neighborly."

620
00:46:54,677 --> 00:46:56,444
But it's true, Rosie.

621
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,446
There's less steam out there,
and it's weaker, too.

622
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:00,448
I don't know if it's their
cell phones or diets,

623
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,116
or their Netflix or what,

624
00:47:02,118 --> 00:47:04,251
but I am not picking up
many scents these days

625
00:47:04,253 --> 00:47:05,786
and the ones that I do, Rosie,
are just not that...

626
00:47:05,788 --> 00:47:08,122
I'll open a canister tonight
to tide everyone over.

627
00:47:08,124 --> 00:47:09,659
Thank you.

628
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:18,165
- You know it, Rosie.
- I know what?

629
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:19,433
It's why
you're up here every day.

630
00:47:19,435 --> 00:47:20,668
It's why you're always up here

631
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,238
no matter
what you tell the others.

632
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:24,638
The world's not as steamy

633
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,742
and you are looking
for a whale.

634
00:48:15,391 --> 00:48:16,524
Oh, watch this kid.

635
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,125
Number 19.

636
00:48:18,127 --> 00:48:19,860
That kid is a natural.

637
00:48:19,862 --> 00:48:21,829
He hits the ball every time.

638
00:48:21,831 --> 00:48:24,365
Like he can read
the pitcher's mind.

639
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:26,102
Hmm. Is that right?

640
00:48:34,143 --> 00:48:35,576
See? You watch,

641
00:48:35,578 --> 00:48:37,244
one of these days,
one of those talent scouts

642
00:48:37,246 --> 00:48:40,149
is gonna get wind of
Brad there. You watch.

643
00:49:01,704 --> 00:49:04,405
Hey, 19,

644
00:49:04,407 --> 00:49:06,674
just saw your game.

645
00:49:06,676 --> 00:49:08,776
You are ready for the majors.

646
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:10,678
- Well played.
- Thanks.

647
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,513
Hey, you headin' home?

648
00:49:12,515 --> 00:49:15,716
You wanna hop in?
I'll give you a ride.

649
00:49:15,718 --> 00:49:17,851
No, it's real close.

650
00:49:17,853 --> 00:49:19,155
I'm good.

651
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,357
It's okay.

652
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,725
We're friends.

653
00:49:24,727 --> 00:49:26,462
You wanna hop in.
We'll take you right home.

654
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:29,432
You can take me right home.

655
00:49:30,433 --> 00:49:32,633
You trust me.

656
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:34,236
I trust you.

657
00:50:08,904 --> 00:50:11,639
No! No, please! No!

658
00:50:22,918 --> 00:50:24,952
No! Please let me go.

659
00:50:24,954 --> 00:50:27,757
Please, I won't tell.
Please. Please!

660
00:50:30,393 --> 00:50:34,294
Number 19.

661
00:50:34,296 --> 00:50:35,796
Kid, you were good.

662
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:37,867
No!

663
00:50:42,571 --> 00:50:44,938
No, please let me go.

664
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,440
I won't tell.

665
00:50:46,442 --> 00:50:48,242
I won't tell. Please.

666
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:49,476
It's okay.

667
00:50:49,478 --> 00:50:50,613
Please.

668
00:50:53,883 --> 00:50:54,884
Ah.

669
00:50:58,988 --> 00:51:01,455
Are you gonna hurt me?

670
00:51:01,457 --> 00:51:02,589
Yes.

671
00:51:02,591 --> 00:51:04,493
No!

672
00:51:05,795 --> 00:51:08,295
Pain purifies steam.

673
00:51:08,297 --> 00:51:10,900
Fear, too, so, you understand.

674
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,287
Shh.

675
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:04,587
Stop.

676
00:52:05,554 --> 00:52:07,055
Stop.

677
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,591
Stop!

678
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:11,961
<i>Stop, monster.</i>

679
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:20,569
<i>Stop. Stop.</i>

680
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:22,772
What is it?

681
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,649
No! Stop!

682
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:41,622
Abra! Abra!

683
00:52:41,624 --> 00:52:43,357
Hey, hey, hey!

684
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,825
Sweetie. Sweetheart, wake up.
Wake up, sweetheart.

685
00:52:44,827 --> 00:52:45,993
- Abra, wake up!
- Hey, hey, hey.

686
00:52:45,995 --> 00:52:47,530
- Abra! Abra!
- Stop it!

687
00:52:56,572 --> 00:52:57,573
Jesus.

688
00:53:42,985 --> 00:53:44,653
Okay.

689
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,889
Okay.

690
00:53:47,656 --> 00:53:49,125
Okay.

691
00:54:51,553 --> 00:54:53,520
Okay, ready?

692
00:55:06,702 --> 00:55:09,103
They killed him.

693
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:11,573
They killed him.

694
00:55:16,545 --> 00:55:18,214
- It's okay.
- It's all right.

695
00:55:29,692 --> 00:55:31,161
We had a looker.

696
00:55:35,898 --> 00:55:37,531
Tonight?

697
00:55:37,533 --> 00:55:38,832
Mmm-hmm.

698
00:55:38,834 --> 00:55:40,667
Yeah.

699
00:55:40,669 --> 00:55:42,903
Big steam?

700
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:45,108
Oh, honey, it was huge.

701
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:47,841
Where?

702
00:55:47,843 --> 00:55:50,080
East Coast, I think.

703
00:55:52,881 --> 00:55:54,781
You're saying
someone looked in

704
00:55:54,783 --> 00:55:57,087
from 1,500 miles away?

705
00:55:58,554 --> 00:56:00,123
Maybe further.

706
00:56:02,024 --> 00:56:03,557
Boy or girl?

707
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:05,226
Girl, I think.

708
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:08,296
She was out of there so fast.

709
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:11,299
But I swear, Crow Daddy,

710
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:14,237
I haven't felt power
like that,

711
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,740
raw power like that...

712
00:56:18,607 --> 00:56:21,175
in so long.

713
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:23,344
Then we need to look into it.

714
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,579
- Sooner the better.
- Yeah.

715
00:56:25,581 --> 00:56:27,215
Case her parents freak out,

716
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,850
send her to a psychiatrist.

717
00:56:29,852 --> 00:56:32,986
You know, they get her on
pills, could ruin the steam.

718
00:56:32,988 --> 00:56:34,122
Might muffle her just...

719
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:35,789
No, giving Paxil to this kid,

720
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:38,026
it's like throwing
a piece of Saran Wrap

721
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:39,693
over a searchlight.

722
00:56:39,695 --> 00:56:42,063
I don't know where she is

723
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:45,932
but when she comes back,
and she'll be back,

724
00:56:45,934 --> 00:56:48,003
oh, I'll be ready, honey.

725
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,940
I'll be ready.

726
00:57:52,868 --> 00:57:54,701
Morning.

727
00:57:54,703 --> 00:57:55,771
Morning.

728
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:58,439
Guess what.

729
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,441
I made a new friend.

730
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:02,276
His name's Dan.

731
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:04,412
Abs, are you okay?

732
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:05,846
Last night, I...

733
00:58:05,848 --> 00:58:07,914
I'm okay.

734
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:09,417
Sorry about that.

735
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:12,719
I know that head of yours
is like a radio sometimes.

736
00:58:12,721 --> 00:58:16,823
And you pick up
some weird stations.

737
00:58:16,825 --> 00:58:17,893
Nothing weird like that.

738
00:58:18,861 --> 00:58:20,863
Not anymore.

739
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,139
<i>My God.</i>

740
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:33,940
<i>I've gotta study.
If I don't study...</i>

741
00:58:33,942 --> 00:58:37,978
<i>Running play.
Hand-off to 11 and...</i>

742
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,947
<i>Coach is gonna kill me
if I don't get these.</i>

743
00:58:40,949 --> 00:58:42,916
<i>Why doesn't he like me?</i>

744
00:58:42,918 --> 00:58:44,885
<i>My hair?
I should change my hair.</i>

745
00:58:44,887 --> 00:58:46,454
<i>The freak
is staring at me again.</i>

746
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,289
<i>What is she staring at?</i>

747
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:49,325
<i>Freak.</i>

748
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,264
Hey, Abba-doo.

749
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:31,499
Hey, Dad.

750
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,934
School okay?

751
00:59:33,936 --> 00:59:35,503
How's the book?

752
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,471
Good. Yeah, going good.

753
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:39,475
I'm writing about
Charleston and Black Bottom.

754
00:59:40,943 --> 00:59:42,143
It's feeling like...

755
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,145
I'm going to
start my homework.

756
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:47,881
Okay. Good.
That's good, sweetie.

757
00:59:47,883 --> 00:59:50,051
Think Harvard in three years.

758
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,252
We'll see.

759
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,122
Yeah. We will see.

760
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

761
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:56,270
<i>Thanks so much
for shopping with us today.</i>

762
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:59,409
<i>And remember, we're
always fresh, just for you.</i>

763
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:30,306
Well, hi there.

764
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:39,515
Get out!

765
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,453
Get out! Get out of my head!

766
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,489
Get out!

767
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:58,466
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- No! No.

768
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:00,503
Yeah, I'm fine.

769
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:03,137
I'm fine.

770
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:12,480
Jesus.

771
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:14,348
Danno?

772
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,816
Dan? Dan?

773
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:18,219
Get up. Stand up, Dan.

774
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:19,455
Come on, Danno.

775
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:23,424
- What happened?
- Well, you just dropped.

776
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:26,195
Thought you was having
a stroke. Who's Tony?

777
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:29,063
What?

778
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:30,366
You kept saying,
"Please help me, Tony."

779
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,634
Oh.

780
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:36,272
Well, I'm sorry about that.

781
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,760
Rosie?

782
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:10,504
We've got a problem.

783
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:11,641
- Talk to me.
- The looker?

784
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:14,875
Yeah, she found me again.

785
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:16,644
- How?
- I don't know.

786
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,178
I don't care.

787
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:21,415
We have to have her, Crow.
We have to.

788
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,717
Does she know who you are?
Where we are?

789
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:25,519
No, I don't know.
I don't think...

790
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:27,089
That's not the important...
Look.

791
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,423
I said she's huge steam,

792
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,658
- right?
- Mmm-hmm.

793
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,459
Yeah, it's even bigger
than that.

794
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:34,128
I tried to turn around in her

795
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,797
and she blew me out of her
like I was nothing.

796
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,198
Bullshit.

797
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,367
No. Never happened
to me, ever.

798
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:42,171
I would have said
that was impossible.

799
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:46,208
Is she food,
or do we turn her?

800
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:48,576
We don't turn her.

801
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:50,144
Rosie, are you sure?

802
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:51,679
If she's what you say
she is, then...

803
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:54,748
Then we don't want anyone
with that power in the Knot.

804
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,752
Jeez. Think about it.

805
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:03,357
Have a great day.

806
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,094
You, too.

807
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,740
<i>Hi.</i>

808
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,686
Billy.

809
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,370
<i>You can hear me.</i>

810
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:58,941
Let's use our outside voices,
all right?

811
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,742
You tracked me down?

812
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:05,579
It was easier than I thought.
Like GPS, but in my head.

813
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:06,914
Look, I don't mean
any offense,

814
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:10,584
but this day and age,
a grown man

815
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,486
sitting with a teenage girl
on a park bench...

816
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:13,787
I'm Abra Stone.

817
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:15,489
And if anyone asks,
you're my uncle.

818
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,426
Uncle Dan.

819
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:22,796
And that's not even a lie.
Not totally.

820
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:24,834
You're magic, like me.

821
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:28,637
I don't know about magic.

822
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:30,704
I...

823
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,539
I always called it
the shining.

824
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:35,342
And, yeah, we both shine.

825
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:36,810
Do your parents know?

826
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:39,580
About my shine?

827
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:41,782
They don't talk about it.

828
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:45,319
Or if I use it,
they look at me different.

829
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:47,721
When I was a kid, I didn't
understand the shining.

830
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,623
I called it "Tony."

831
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,959
I thought he was
my imaginary friend.

832
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:55,029
I thought you were
my imaginary friend...

833
01:08:55,031 --> 01:08:57,333
for a long time.

834
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:01,869
How many of us are out there?

835
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:03,904
There's a lot of people who
have a little bit of shine,

836
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,606
they don't even know it.

837
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,007
They always seem
to come home with flowers

838
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:08,876
when their wives are sad,

839
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:10,944
or they do well on the school
test they didn't study for.

840
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:13,814
But I only met two or three
people in my whole life

841
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,417
who knew they shined.

842
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,887
The baseball boy shined.

843
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:22,391
His name was Bradley Trevor.

844
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:27,128
These people...

845
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:29,865
they look like people anyway,
they took him.

846
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,069
And they ate him.

847
01:09:34,104 --> 01:09:36,837
They ate his shine.

848
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,373
You could feel it?

849
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:40,776
And they could feel me.

850
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:44,078
If you could get
something of his,

851
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,612
if you could go to Iowa...

852
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:47,447
- Whoa, hang on.
- I can help you find him.

853
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:48,916
Then his parents would know
where he was.

854
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,884
They could bury him right,
at least.

855
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:52,953
We could also get his glove.

856
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:54,922
If I can touch that glove,
I can track them.

857
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,590
Easy. Easy.

858
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:59,160
Because Barry the Chunk,
I think that was his name,

859
01:09:59,162 --> 01:10:01,428
for a while,
before they killed him,

860
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:03,399
he was wearing it.

861
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:17,711
Abra, go home.

862
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,680
Don't chase these people.

863
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,715
Don't aggravate them.

864
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:24,852
And whatever you do,
don't attract their attention.

865
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:26,587
Find something, anything,

866
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:30,757
well, almost anything,
to stop that shine of yours.

867
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:32,626
Keep your head down
and hope to God

868
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:35,096
that these people
or anything like them,

869
01:10:35,098 --> 01:10:37,898
that they don't see you.

870
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,567
If they see you,
they come back.

871
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,671
Abra, do you hear me?

872
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:45,774
They come back.

873
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:50,080
Keep your head down.
Stay safe.

874
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:53,515
I'm sorry.

875
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,628
Hey, Azzie.

876
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:20,774
You got your wires
crossed tonight.

877
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:25,014
That room's empty, Az.

878
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,754
There's no one in that room.

879
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,996
Whoa! Hang on, Doc.

880
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:43,999
Dick.

881
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:47,201
Oh, I'm so sorry.

882
01:11:47,203 --> 01:11:48,802
I... I... I thought it was...

883
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,671
Thought I was
from the Overlook.

884
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:53,006
Almost locked me up.

885
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:55,642
Still getting visits
from them old ghosts?

886
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,544
No, not for years.

887
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,180
Horace Derwent
was the last one,

888
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:00,914
confetti on his suit.

889
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,883
Said, "Great party, isn't it?"

890
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:04,551
Shit-eating grin on his face

891
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:06,254
till I pulled out
a box for him.

892
01:12:06,256 --> 01:12:09,523
That grin went fast.

893
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,825
Hey, it never occurred to me
to ask you back then,

894
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,660
what happens to them
in those boxes?

895
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,029
Do they die in there?

896
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:16,732
Do you care?

897
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:20,068
I missed you.

898
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:21,603
Has it been a long time?

899
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:25,239
Can't tell.

900
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:29,110
This world is a dream
of a dream to me now.

901
01:12:29,112 --> 01:12:32,213
Eight years. Little more.

902
01:12:32,215 --> 01:12:34,614
Why are you here?

903
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:38,119
I'm here because
it all comes 'round.

904
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:41,089
Ka's a wheel, Doc.

905
01:12:41,091 --> 01:12:44,624
These empty devils
ever found you

906
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:46,194
when you was a tyke,

907
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:48,662
if they'd even sniffed you,

908
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:50,931
you'd be long dead.

909
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:53,167
They eat screams,

910
01:12:53,169 --> 01:12:55,769
and drink pain,

911
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,741
and they've noticed
that little girl.

912
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,910
They might kill her,

913
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:05,979
might turn her...

914
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:08,915
or might keep her
till she's all used up,

915
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:10,284
and that'd be worst of all.

916
01:13:10,286 --> 01:13:12,955
You can't let 'em.

917
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,723
Why me?

918
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:19,093
Because she found you.

919
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:22,696
Because she showed up.
Hell, Doc, why me?

920
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:24,965
You just walked on
into my kitchen one day,

921
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:26,367
and I'm still on the hook.

922
01:13:26,369 --> 01:13:29,139
What the hell am I
supposed to do?

923
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:33,842
Get her what she asked for.

924
01:13:35,111 --> 01:13:38,312
You won't see me again, Doc.

925
01:13:38,314 --> 01:13:40,816
This is my last dream.

926
01:13:46,389 --> 01:13:50,224
It seems to me
you grew up fine, son,

927
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:53,063
but you still owe a debt.

928
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:59,135
Pay it.

929
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:16,950
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

930
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,219
You feeling okay?

931
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:20,254
We missed you at dinner.

932
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:23,692
I'm okay.
Just had a rough day.

933
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:30,764
I'm flying out to see Momo
in the morning.

934
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:32,801
I'll be back as soon as I can.

935
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:36,306
Abs, is she...

936
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:42,145
Is she gonna pull through
this time?

937
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:47,117
I don't know.

938
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:50,086
I hope so.

939
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:52,688
Tell her I love her.

940
01:17:35,485 --> 01:17:37,919
Keep sleeping, princess.

941
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:54,635
You rubes.

942
01:17:54,637 --> 01:17:58,205
Spend your whole lives
making little boxes,

943
01:17:58,207 --> 01:18:01,242
little memories.

944
01:18:01,244 --> 01:18:04,211
Oh, you think
they make you so rich.

945
01:18:04,213 --> 01:18:06,449
You should see mine, kiddo.

946
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:11,321
Oh, my mind's a cathedral.

947
01:18:14,424 --> 01:18:17,226
Well, hi there.

948
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,169
Hmm.

949
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
He said you'd come back.
And you did.

950
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:48,955
Good.

951
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:50,093
No!

952
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:54,562
Get back! Get back!

953
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:57,400
You're just a fucking child!

954
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:04,171
Where are you?

955
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:06,474
Where? Where did you...
Where...

956
01:19:06,476 --> 01:19:08,509
What did you...
Where did you...

957
01:19:10,146 --> 01:19:11,147
No.

958
01:19:13,282 --> 01:19:15,149
Get out! Get out!

959
01:19:15,151 --> 01:19:16,350
<i>Get out!</i>

960
01:20:02,064 --> 01:20:03,130
Rose?

961
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,465
Trap.

962
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:05,766
Trap.

963
01:20:05,768 --> 01:20:07,401
What the hell happened?

964
01:20:07,403 --> 01:20:09,002
Little bitch
set a trap for me.

965
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:10,571
Oh, my God. Oh, your hand.

966
01:20:10,573 --> 01:20:12,306
Rose! Rose, calm down.

967
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,542
We know where she is now,
right? Now we know.

968
01:20:14,544 --> 01:20:16,076
She was in my head!

969
01:20:16,078 --> 01:20:17,578
- What?
- Stealing!

970
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:20,147
- What does she know?
- I don't know. I don't know.

971
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:22,750
- How much does she...
- I don't know!

972
01:20:22,752 --> 01:20:25,018
- I don't know...
- There's a problem.

973
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,086
Not now!

974
01:20:26,088 --> 01:20:27,190
Grampa Flick...

975
01:20:28,191 --> 01:20:30,159
I think he's cycling.

976
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:38,232
<i>Uncle Dan!
Uncle Dan, I hurt her.</i>

977
01:20:38,234 --> 01:20:39,433
<i>I really hurt her.</i>

978
01:20:39,435 --> 01:20:41,168
I hurt her
and she deserved it,

979
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,570
and that's not the best part.
The best part is...

980
01:20:42,572 --> 01:20:44,371
<i>The best part is
I got in her head.</i>

981
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:46,173
<i>I got in her head.</i>

982
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,442
- <i>Uncle Dan? Are you there?</i>
- Oh, God, Abra.

983
01:20:48,444 --> 01:20:49,610
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

984
01:20:49,612 --> 01:20:51,012
What have you done?

985
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:09,630
Just talk to the kid.

986
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:12,568
If we're gonna do this,
then let's do this.

987
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:16,272
<i>Hi, Abra.</i>

988
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:22,311
I can hear you.

989
01:21:26,315 --> 01:21:28,315
I don't understand.

990
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:29,452
You will.

991
01:21:31,287 --> 01:21:34,288
I thought we lived forever.

992
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:36,757
Did someone
promise you that, Andi?

993
01:21:36,759 --> 01:21:40,494
Did someone say
you're immortal?

994
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:45,432
I said, "Live long, eat well."

995
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:47,535
We can live long, very long.

996
01:21:47,537 --> 01:21:48,669
And we do,

997
01:21:48,671 --> 01:21:50,337
most of us.

998
01:21:50,339 --> 01:21:52,542
But we haven't
been eating well.

999
01:21:53,643 --> 01:21:56,610
Not for a long time.

1000
01:21:56,612 --> 01:21:58,047
Rosie, he's going.

1001
01:21:59,682 --> 01:22:00,816
Rosie.

1002
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:08,424
Yes, love?

1003
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:11,325
I'm scared.

1004
01:22:11,327 --> 01:22:13,861
No, you're not.

1005
01:22:13,863 --> 01:22:17,398
You watched empires rise

1006
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,433
and fall.

1007
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,902
Cheered the gladiators
in Rome.

1008
01:22:21,904 --> 01:22:24,405
Sailed across oceans

1009
01:22:24,407 --> 01:22:26,507
to new worlds

1010
01:22:26,509 --> 01:22:27,675
while you fed on

1011
01:22:27,677 --> 01:22:32,513
kings, and princes, and popes.

1012
01:22:32,515 --> 01:22:35,316
They wrote myths of you,

1013
01:22:35,318 --> 01:22:37,651
and made statues,

1014
01:22:37,653 --> 01:22:42,423
and they trembled
in their villages, and beds...

1015
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:45,328
and skyscrapers.

1016
01:22:46,362 --> 01:22:48,862
So, no...

1017
01:22:48,864 --> 01:22:51,734
...you're not scared.

1018
01:22:52,902 --> 01:22:55,171
You're a king,

1019
01:22:56,172 --> 01:22:59,709
and you eat fear.

1020
01:23:50,259 --> 01:23:51,492
Hey, bro.

1021
01:23:51,494 --> 01:23:52,826
You know, it's 4:00 a.m.

1022
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:54,795
You've always seen me, Billy.

1023
01:23:54,797 --> 01:23:58,532
You have a good sense about
people, is that fair to say?

1024
01:23:58,534 --> 01:23:59,900
Yeah, what...

1025
01:23:59,902 --> 01:24:01,802
You think I'm an honest man?
A good man?

1026
01:24:01,804 --> 01:24:03,404
I do, I do. Dan, I...

1027
01:24:03,406 --> 01:24:04,938
I need your help.

1028
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,674
The first thing I need is
for you to listen to a story

1029
01:24:06,676 --> 01:24:09,945
and try harder than you've
ever tried to believe me.

1030
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:28,796
How's it going?

1031
01:24:28,798 --> 01:24:31,598
Oh, hey. Shouldn't you
be getting ready for school?

1032
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,334
Yeah, but I wanted
to tag along.

1033
01:24:34,336 --> 01:24:35,836
How long
have you been driving?

1034
01:24:35,838 --> 01:24:39,475
A few hours or so. We should
get there tonight. Late.

1035
01:24:41,711 --> 01:24:43,410
Who's that?

1036
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,713
He's my friend.

1037
01:24:45,715 --> 01:24:48,716
Maybe my best friend.

1038
01:24:48,718 --> 01:24:50,718
You should've seen her face.

1039
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,786
She was scared, Uncle Dan.

1040
01:24:52,788 --> 01:24:54,688
Scared like
all those kids were scared.

1041
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:56,490
All those kids she's killed.

1042
01:24:56,492 --> 01:24:59,460
She was so mad
and so scared that I got in.

1043
01:24:59,462 --> 01:25:01,062
That was a new trick.

1044
01:25:01,064 --> 01:25:02,830
I've never done that before.

1045
01:25:02,832 --> 01:25:04,700
Yeah, me neither.
What was it like?

1046
01:25:05,534 --> 01:25:06,967
Like a library.

1047
01:25:06,969 --> 01:25:09,405
I guess we're
all libraries inside.

1048
01:25:10,339 --> 01:25:11,839
How'd you do it?

1049
01:25:11,841 --> 01:25:13,841
Like this. Just a little push.

1050
01:25:19,381 --> 01:25:20,647
Abra!

1051
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:22,685
Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry!

1052
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:29,323
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

1053
01:25:29,325 --> 01:25:30,791
It's okay.

1054
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:31,927
What were all those boxes?

1055
01:25:32,728 --> 01:25:33,861
Nothing.

1056
01:25:33,863 --> 01:25:35,297
Liar.

1057
01:25:38,101 --> 01:25:40,667
When I was a kid,

1058
01:25:40,669 --> 01:25:42,070
younger than you,

1059
01:25:42,072 --> 01:25:43,670
I bumped into
something like these things

1060
01:25:43,672 --> 01:25:46,573
that ate like they do.

1061
01:25:46,575 --> 01:25:50,444
Only it wasn't a person,
it was a place.

1062
01:25:50,446 --> 01:25:54,948
They closed it down after
and let it rot.

1063
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:57,887
But the things
that lived there, they...

1064
01:25:59,522 --> 01:26:01,588
Don't go poking around
in there again.

1065
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:05,028
Okay, I won't. I promise.

1066
01:26:10,066 --> 01:26:11,500
Phew!

1067
01:26:17,573 --> 01:26:19,773
We're almost ready.
We're just loading up.

1068
01:26:19,775 --> 01:26:21,142
Good.

1069
01:26:21,144 --> 01:26:22,643
Get the caravan on the road

1070
01:26:22,645 --> 01:26:24,045
and we'll have her
in a day or two.

1071
01:26:24,047 --> 01:26:26,880
I don't think
you should come, Rosie.

1072
01:26:26,882 --> 01:26:29,683
The fuck did you just say?

1073
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:32,086
She tagged you.
She got in your head.

1074
01:26:32,088 --> 01:26:33,821
Yeah, it won't happen again.

1075
01:26:33,823 --> 01:26:34,888
And who knows
how much she got to

1076
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,057
before you kicked her out.

1077
01:26:36,059 --> 01:26:37,558
She's mine, Crow.

1078
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:38,892
Right now, as far as we know,

1079
01:26:38,894 --> 01:26:41,528
you are the only one of us
she could track.

1080
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:43,097
Now, if she sees you coming,

1081
01:26:43,099 --> 01:26:44,865
she could run

1082
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:47,369
or set another trap.

1083
01:26:50,506 --> 01:26:53,941
You know I'm right about this.

1084
01:26:53,943 --> 01:26:55,978
If she pulls a trick on you...

1085
01:26:57,947 --> 01:26:59,847
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1086
01:26:59,849 --> 01:27:02,852
But I got some tricks
of my own.

1087
01:27:10,193 --> 01:27:12,062
Hey, I think
we're here.

1088
01:27:14,663 --> 01:27:17,031
Okay.

1089
01:27:17,033 --> 01:27:19,368
I'll see if I can get her.

1090
01:27:20,002 --> 01:27:21,003
Abra?

1091
01:27:22,938 --> 01:27:25,706
That's the sign.
Pull around back.

1092
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:27,208
She says to pull around back.

1093
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:28,542
And I'll tell you
when to stop.

1094
01:27:28,544 --> 01:27:30,646
She'll tell us when to stop.

1095
01:27:36,619 --> 01:27:37,985
I gotta tell you,
Danno,

1096
01:27:37,987 --> 01:27:39,553
I don't know whether

1097
01:27:39,555 --> 01:27:41,089
I hope you're right
or wrong about this.

1098
01:27:41,091 --> 01:27:44,958
I mean, if you're wrong,
my friend is crazy.

1099
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,629
I mean, full-blown...

1100
01:27:47,563 --> 01:27:48,962
mental breakdown,

1101
01:27:48,964 --> 01:27:52,633
imaginary-monsters-
killing-imaginary-kids

1102
01:27:52,635 --> 01:27:54,068
bonkers.

1103
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:57,771
But, you know,
I... I can work with that.

1104
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,473
If you're right, though...

1105
01:27:59,475 --> 01:28:00,741
I know.

1106
01:28:00,743 --> 01:28:02,778
It's much worse.

1107
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,126
You should go home.

1108
01:28:18,128 --> 01:28:19,893
What?

1109
01:28:19,895 --> 01:28:22,230
No, not you.

1110
01:28:22,232 --> 01:28:23,764
I can handle it.

1111
01:28:23,766 --> 01:28:26,535
No. We'll take it from here.

1112
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:31,473
Okay, it's just us.

1113
01:28:48,023 --> 01:28:50,459
You smell that?

1114
01:28:52,262 --> 01:28:54,828
Used to hunt.
I ever tell you that?

1115
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,130
No.

1116
01:28:56,132 --> 01:28:57,798
Deer.

1117
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,101
This one summer,

1118
01:29:00,103 --> 01:29:02,036
I clipped this buck.

1119
01:29:02,038 --> 01:29:04,671
I was tracking it
for two days.

1120
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:07,841
I got the shot, clipped him.

1121
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:10,111
He ran off, I went after.

1122
01:29:10,113 --> 01:29:13,880
Figured he wasn't
gonna last long.

1123
01:29:15,185 --> 01:29:16,186
Then he vanished.

1124
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:20,121
Just up and evaporated.

1125
01:29:20,123 --> 01:29:22,992
Not a trace.
Truly baffling.

1126
01:29:25,594 --> 01:29:27,028
Five days later,

1127
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:29,963
I'm trying a different spot,
miles away.

1128
01:29:29,965 --> 01:29:33,869
I come around looking
for a spot for a blind,

1129
01:29:35,071 --> 01:29:37,107
then I smelled him.

1130
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:39,808
Smelled him.

1131
01:29:40,642 --> 01:29:42,276
Found that buck

1132
01:29:42,278 --> 01:29:45,579
holed up to a hollow trunk.

1133
01:29:45,581 --> 01:29:47,217
Dead for days.

1134
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:50,086
The smell...

1135
01:29:51,187 --> 01:29:53,689
Never hunted a day since.

1136
01:29:56,825 --> 01:29:59,162
This is the same smell.

1137
01:30:14,643 --> 01:30:15,911
Billy.

1138
01:30:35,631 --> 01:30:37,300
Oh, my God!

1139
01:31:09,698 --> 01:31:10,931
Fuck.

1140
01:31:10,933 --> 01:31:13,434
Fuck, Danno. What the fuck?

1141
01:31:13,436 --> 01:31:15,001
They didn't
even bury him deep.

1142
01:31:15,003 --> 01:31:16,070
They buried him shallow.

1143
01:31:16,072 --> 01:31:17,207
I'm sorry, Billy.

1144
01:31:18,441 --> 01:31:20,909
What did you
get us into?

1145
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:30,451
The people who did that...

1146
01:31:30,453 --> 01:31:32,953
They're not people.

1147
01:31:32,955 --> 01:31:35,822
No. No, they ain't.

1148
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:38,892
Anyone do that
to a little boy,

1149
01:31:38,894 --> 01:31:41,062
they ain't people.

1150
01:31:41,064 --> 01:31:42,396
Did you get it?

1151
01:31:42,398 --> 01:31:43,730
Yeah, we got it.

1152
01:31:43,732 --> 01:31:45,299
Is she back?

1153
01:31:45,301 --> 01:31:47,268
We're heading back to you.
We'll be back in the morning.

1154
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:48,271
We got a stop to make.

1155
01:31:50,873 --> 01:31:53,907
I need you to show your
parents what's happening.

1156
01:31:53,909 --> 01:31:54,975
No.

1157
01:31:54,977 --> 01:31:56,210
- Yeah.
- No.

1158
01:31:56,212 --> 01:31:58,011
They almost think I'm normal.

1159
01:31:58,013 --> 01:31:59,447
If I tell them, they'll...

1160
01:31:59,449 --> 01:32:01,249
Rose'll go through them
to get to you.

1161
01:32:01,251 --> 01:32:02,849
You know that, don't you?

1162
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,485
She'll cut them down
without a second thought.

1163
01:32:04,487 --> 01:32:06,920
And she's coming, Abra.

1164
01:32:06,922 --> 01:32:08,724
They need to know.

1165
01:32:13,296 --> 01:32:15,762
So, what's this stop
we gotta make?

1166
01:32:15,764 --> 01:32:18,034
You still got
those old deer rifles?

1167
01:32:35,385 --> 01:32:37,084
You're Uncle Dan?

1168
01:32:37,086 --> 01:32:38,785
- The fuck you think you are?
- Sir...

1169
01:32:38,787 --> 01:32:40,787
Hmm? She is 13 years old!

1170
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:42,156
Abra, I told you to show him.

1171
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:43,957
- I told him.
- Well, that's not the same.

1172
01:32:43,959 --> 01:32:45,226
I'm gonna kick your ass
before I call the police, huh?

1173
01:32:45,228 --> 01:32:46,394
- Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, no. Abra.

1174
01:32:46,396 --> 01:32:47,495
Now, don't you say her name.

1175
01:32:47,497 --> 01:32:49,763
Abra...

1176
01:33:03,346 --> 01:33:06,880
I'm sorry, Mr. Stone.
I am a friend.

1177
01:33:06,882 --> 01:33:09,185
Everything she told you
is true.

1178
01:33:20,896 --> 01:33:22,063
No, thanks.

1179
01:33:22,065 --> 01:33:23,066
No.

1180
01:33:32,408 --> 01:33:34,177
Those people,

1181
01:33:35,345 --> 01:33:37,278
they know about my daughter?

1182
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,080
They do.

1183
01:33:39,082 --> 01:33:41,848
And sooner or later,
they're coming.

1184
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:43,251
We gotta do something.

1185
01:33:43,253 --> 01:33:45,186
All right, we're calling
the police, the FBI...

1186
01:33:45,188 --> 01:33:48,021
These people have been
around a long, long time, sir.

1187
01:33:48,023 --> 01:33:49,590
They're rich, connected.

1188
01:33:49,592 --> 01:33:52,126
I don't think they're worried
about the police.

1189
01:33:52,128 --> 01:33:53,527
But where are they?

1190
01:33:53,529 --> 01:33:56,063
When are they coming?
Where can we go?

1191
01:33:56,065 --> 01:33:57,998
Abra can answer that,

1192
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,469
if she's ready.

1193
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:02,272
I'm ready.

1194
01:34:11,514 --> 01:34:13,481
You sure you wanna do this?

1195
01:34:13,483 --> 01:34:15,184
I have to.

1196
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:58,992
I-95.

1197
01:34:58,994 --> 01:35:01,928
Barry, the Crow, the Snake,
and a few others.

1198
01:35:01,930 --> 01:35:03,230
The trees haven't
changed that much,

1199
01:35:03,232 --> 01:35:05,266
so maybe Massachusetts,

1200
01:35:05,268 --> 01:35:07,967
- but they're close.
- Rose?

1201
01:35:07,969 --> 01:35:09,603
Didn't see her.

1202
01:35:09,605 --> 01:35:11,040
But they're coming.

1203
01:35:14,976 --> 01:35:17,511
This is the only room she saw?

1204
01:35:17,513 --> 01:35:19,012
That's right.

1205
01:35:19,014 --> 01:35:22,183
And I made a few changes.
Hid a few things.

1206
01:35:22,185 --> 01:35:24,251
All right.

1207
01:35:24,253 --> 01:35:26,554
Well, they'll be trying
to track you,

1208
01:35:26,556 --> 01:35:28,358
trying to catch on.

1209
01:35:30,093 --> 01:35:32,660
And you're gonna let them.

1210
01:35:32,662 --> 01:35:34,395
Are you crazy?

1211
01:35:34,397 --> 01:35:36,664
Possibly, but you're
gonna let them,

1212
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:39,268
and then I need you to try
and do a little trick.

1213
01:35:40,103 --> 01:35:41,437
A magic trick?

1214
01:35:49,379 --> 01:35:51,278
They're following us.

1215
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,483
Concentrate. You gotta
keep it up until they land.

1216
01:35:54,350 --> 01:35:55,385
I know.

1217
01:36:27,183 --> 01:36:28,582
This should work.

1218
01:36:28,584 --> 01:36:31,387
Good blinds over there,
and there.

1219
01:36:34,424 --> 01:36:35,556
They still close?

1220
01:36:35,558 --> 01:36:37,458
Getting closer, I think.

1221
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:38,626
This is tough.

1222
01:36:38,628 --> 01:36:41,297
I know. I know.
How much longer?

1223
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,569
Okay, Crow Daddy,

1224
01:36:47,403 --> 01:36:49,372
go get her.

1225
01:37:35,751 --> 01:37:38,319
You look relaxed.

1226
01:37:38,321 --> 01:37:41,457
You feel relaxed,
don't you, Abra?

1227
01:37:42,124 --> 01:37:43,257
I guess.

1228
01:37:43,259 --> 01:37:45,125
You should.

1229
01:37:45,127 --> 01:37:46,660
Just relax.

1230
01:37:46,662 --> 01:37:48,562
We're friends.

1231
01:37:48,564 --> 01:37:50,297
You're friends.

1232
01:37:50,299 --> 01:37:51,667
That's right.

1233
01:37:52,468 --> 01:37:54,568
Just friends.

1234
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:59,373
And we want to take you
to meet more friends.

1235
01:37:59,375 --> 01:38:00,776
Good friends.

1236
01:38:05,081 --> 01:38:06,480
Well, shit.

1237
01:38:06,482 --> 01:38:08,182
The way they talked you up,

1238
01:38:08,184 --> 01:38:09,783
I was thinking it'd be
a little harder than that.

1239
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:16,490
The fuck?

1240
01:38:16,492 --> 01:38:19,193
Parlor tricks.
Just fuckin' parlor tricks.

1241
01:38:23,366 --> 01:38:25,099
No! Get out of there!

1242
01:38:25,101 --> 01:38:26,135
Get out of there!

1243
01:38:32,642 --> 01:38:34,176
No!

1244
01:38:48,190 --> 01:38:49,225
No!

1245
01:38:58,301 --> 01:38:59,867
<i>You deserve it.</i>

1246
01:38:59,869 --> 01:39:02,736
You deserve it.
All of you.

1247
01:39:07,777 --> 01:39:08,778
No!

1248
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,701
Oh, fuck.

1249
01:40:07,570 --> 01:40:08,571
Stop.

1250
01:40:13,376 --> 01:40:16,445
I just got one question
for you, sweetie.

1251
01:40:17,513 --> 01:40:19,313
Aren't you sleepy?

1252
01:40:21,884 --> 01:40:23,686
You're sleepy.

1253
01:40:28,557 --> 01:40:29,625
Sleep.

1254
01:40:31,527 --> 01:40:32,528
Sleep.

1255
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:36,897
Wake up! Uncle Dan!

1256
01:40:36,899 --> 01:40:39,299
Wake up! Wake up.

1257
01:40:39,301 --> 01:40:41,769
<i>Wake up!</i>

1258
01:40:41,771 --> 01:40:43,673
Fucking men.

1259
01:40:45,241 --> 01:40:47,176
Fucking men.

1260
01:41:03,292 --> 01:41:04,593
Stay back, Billy.

1261
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:09,632
Kill yourself.

1262
01:41:12,035 --> 01:41:13,434
No!

1263
01:41:13,436 --> 01:41:14,603
Billy!

1264
01:41:31,287 --> 01:41:33,520
There is one missing.

1265
01:41:33,522 --> 01:41:35,022
I didn't see the Crow.

1266
01:41:35,024 --> 01:41:36,659
Where is the Crow?

1267
01:41:38,561 --> 01:41:39,762
Hello, Abra.

1268
01:41:45,801 --> 01:41:47,770
Abra!

1269
01:42:20,369 --> 01:42:22,805
Oh, good, you're awake.

1270
01:42:32,715 --> 01:42:33,781
Dan...

1271
01:42:33,783 --> 01:42:35,384
Don't bother.

1272
01:42:42,391 --> 01:42:44,424
What's wrong with me?

1273
01:42:44,426 --> 01:42:46,593
You've been dosed, missy.

1274
01:42:46,595 --> 01:42:48,962
More than
I've ever used before.

1275
01:42:48,964 --> 01:42:51,799
Might let you wake up
here and there,

1276
01:42:51,801 --> 01:42:53,969
but that steam of yours
is fast asleep.

1277
01:42:57,107 --> 01:42:59,706
My dad...

1278
01:42:59,708 --> 01:43:01,708
What happened to my dad?

1279
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:04,378
Lot of good people
killed today.

1280
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:07,414
Lot of good people.

1281
01:43:07,416 --> 01:43:09,783
I'd love to tell you
someone will pay,

1282
01:43:09,785 --> 01:43:13,622
some kind of justice raining
down on the sad events today,

1283
01:43:14,757 --> 01:43:17,091
but it don't work like that.

1284
01:43:17,093 --> 01:43:20,094
We were always gonna have you.

1285
01:43:20,096 --> 01:43:22,763
Some of my people are dead.

1286
01:43:22,765 --> 01:43:25,166
Some of yours are dead.

1287
01:43:25,168 --> 01:43:28,602
Outcome didn't change, though.

1288
01:43:28,604 --> 01:43:30,804
Think on that a minute.

1289
01:43:30,806 --> 01:43:33,107
The outcome didn't change.

1290
01:43:33,109 --> 01:43:34,677
So, their deaths,

1291
01:43:35,544 --> 01:43:37,477
all of them,

1292
01:43:37,479 --> 01:43:39,646
just a waste.

1293
01:43:39,648 --> 01:43:43,051
A waste you brought on
to us all, young lady.

1294
01:43:43,053 --> 01:43:44,685
For what?

1295
01:43:46,021 --> 01:43:48,021
Please hear me...

1296
01:43:48,023 --> 01:43:50,757
Ain't nobody hearing you.

1297
01:43:50,759 --> 01:43:54,595
Might as well calm down
and enjoy the ride.

1298
01:43:54,597 --> 01:43:56,763
Like I said,

1299
01:43:56,765 --> 01:43:59,069
outcome hasn't changed.

1300
01:44:19,222 --> 01:44:20,756
No.

1301
01:44:22,125 --> 01:44:23,924
Please.

1302
01:44:23,926 --> 01:44:26,562
Oh, please, please, please.

1303
01:44:27,230 --> 01:44:28,864
Please.

1304
01:44:31,967 --> 01:44:33,836
Abra!

1305
01:44:36,705 --> 01:44:38,474
<i>Abra.</i>

1306
01:44:44,980 --> 01:44:46,149
Tony?

1307
01:44:48,184 --> 01:44:50,853
Help me, please, Tony.

1308
01:44:55,958 --> 01:44:57,426
God.

1309
01:45:07,736 --> 01:45:09,836
Okay. Okay.

1310
01:45:09,838 --> 01:45:11,272
Okay, okay.

1311
01:45:11,274 --> 01:45:13,874
Okay, you always said...

1312
01:45:13,876 --> 01:45:15,642
your brain was like a radio.

1313
01:45:15,644 --> 01:45:18,545
No one's answering when
you call, so stop calling.

1314
01:45:18,547 --> 01:45:20,549
And just listen.

1315
01:45:37,633 --> 01:45:39,900
<i>Dan. Dan.</i>

1316
01:45:39,902 --> 01:45:40,903
<i>Help.</i>

1317
01:45:55,285 --> 01:45:56,717
Hi.

1318
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:58,554
Dan.

1319
01:46:00,789 --> 01:46:02,225
Did he drug you?

1320
01:46:03,625 --> 01:46:06,294
I'm so sorry.

1321
01:46:06,296 --> 01:46:08,329
I'm gonna try something, okay?

1322
01:46:08,331 --> 01:46:09,663
But you're weak.

1323
01:46:09,665 --> 01:46:11,232
He's blocking you.

1324
01:46:11,234 --> 01:46:13,867
I could barely hear you.

1325
01:46:13,869 --> 01:46:15,704
You gotta trust me, okay?

1326
01:46:16,872 --> 01:46:18,507
Okay?

1327
01:46:32,155 --> 01:46:35,289
Awake again, huh?

1328
01:46:35,291 --> 01:46:38,294
Might have to dose you
at the next rest stop.

1329
01:46:39,962 --> 01:46:41,862
Where are we going?

1330
01:46:41,864 --> 01:46:44,798
Mmm, you know where.

1331
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:47,203
Fuck, I feel hungover.

1332
01:46:49,605 --> 01:46:52,073
I told you it's good shit.

1333
01:46:52,075 --> 01:46:54,007
Haven't felt hungover
in years.

1334
01:46:54,009 --> 01:46:55,309
And, you know,
I don't miss it.

1335
01:46:55,311 --> 01:46:56,879
Not even a little.

1336
01:46:58,814 --> 01:47:00,714
West, huh?

1337
01:47:00,716 --> 01:47:03,652
Stayin' off the major roads.
Smart.

1338
01:47:05,888 --> 01:47:08,557
Crownville. New York.

1339
01:47:11,227 --> 01:47:13,760
Who are you?

1340
01:47:13,762 --> 01:47:16,232
I'm the guy
that killed your friends.

1341
01:47:21,404 --> 01:47:23,672
It's nice to meet you.

1342
01:47:24,773 --> 01:47:26,307
Neat trick.

1343
01:47:26,309 --> 01:47:28,376
Haven't seen this one before.

1344
01:47:28,378 --> 01:47:30,313
Wanna see one more?

1345
01:47:33,283 --> 01:47:37,087
Don't imagine Rose'll be too
happy if you shoot the prize.

1346
01:47:39,355 --> 01:47:43,091
I don't suppose Rose will be
happy about any of this.

1347
01:47:43,093 --> 01:47:45,859
And when that woman gets mad,

1348
01:47:45,861 --> 01:47:47,028
well,

1349
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:48,396
it seems to me you know enough

1350
01:47:48,398 --> 01:47:51,132
to know you might
wanna sit this one out.

1351
01:47:51,134 --> 01:47:52,966
Count your blessings.

1352
01:47:52,968 --> 01:47:53,969
Go on your way.

1353
01:47:56,839 --> 01:47:58,439
What's so funny, friend?

1354
01:47:58,441 --> 01:48:02,676
Well, it's just arrogance.
It's arrogance, really.

1355
01:48:02,678 --> 01:48:04,010
But it makes sense,

1356
01:48:04,012 --> 01:48:06,012
if you think
you're gonna live forever.

1357
01:48:06,014 --> 01:48:08,216
Stands to reason,

1358
01:48:08,218 --> 01:48:10,353
of course you wouldn't
wear your seatbelt.

1359
01:48:20,063 --> 01:48:23,199
No!

1360
01:48:33,709 --> 01:48:35,278
Dan?

1361
01:48:36,346 --> 01:48:37,711
Dan?

1362
01:49:08,977 --> 01:49:11,145
I hope that hurts.

1363
01:49:11,147 --> 01:49:13,247
Rosie...

1364
01:49:13,249 --> 01:49:15,183
A lot.

1365
01:50:02,232 --> 01:50:04,733
You little bitch.

1366
01:50:07,036 --> 01:50:08,904
What have you done?

1367
01:50:20,149 --> 01:50:22,352
All right, bitch child.

1368
01:50:23,052 --> 01:50:24,053
All right.

1369
01:51:32,155 --> 01:51:33,354
Sorry.

1370
01:51:33,356 --> 01:51:34,522
Dozed off.

1371
01:51:34,524 --> 01:51:37,293
No, you earned it.

1372
01:51:39,928 --> 01:51:41,128
Where are we?

1373
01:51:41,130 --> 01:51:43,097
Ohio.

1374
01:51:43,099 --> 01:51:44,231
Where are we going?

1375
01:51:44,233 --> 01:51:45,401
Colorado.

1376
01:51:46,636 --> 01:51:48,970
Why Colorado?

1377
01:51:51,107 --> 01:51:53,641
She's gonna keep coming.

1378
01:51:53,643 --> 01:51:56,610
- I know.
- Always.

1379
01:51:56,612 --> 01:51:58,479
This only ends if we end it,

1380
01:51:58,481 --> 01:52:00,548
and I don't think
we can beat her.

1381
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:02,552
Not by ourselves.

1382
01:52:04,387 --> 01:52:05,952
There's a place.

1383
01:52:05,954 --> 01:52:08,656
A place that's dangerous
for people like us.

1384
01:52:08,658 --> 01:52:11,991
The place you told me about?
The hungry place?

1385
01:52:11,993 --> 01:52:13,427
Yeah, that's right.

1386
01:52:13,429 --> 01:52:16,530
If it's so dangerous,
why would we go there?

1387
01:52:16,532 --> 01:52:18,632
Well, if it's dangerous
for people like us,

1388
01:52:18,634 --> 01:52:21,968
I expect it's dangerous
for people like her.

1389
01:52:21,970 --> 01:52:23,606
Maybe even more so.

1390
01:52:24,607 --> 01:52:26,574
Good.

1391
01:52:26,576 --> 01:52:29,543
She's following us, you know.

1392
01:52:29,545 --> 01:52:32,048
Yeah, good. Let her.

1393
01:52:39,222 --> 01:52:41,557
I'm sorry about your father.

1394
01:52:43,426 --> 01:52:46,028
Sorry about your friend.

1395
01:53:07,983 --> 01:53:10,251
It's my mom.

1396
01:53:10,253 --> 01:53:12,486
What do I say to her?

1397
01:53:16,392 --> 01:53:17,458
Hi, Mom.

1398
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:18,692
Oh, thank God!

1399
01:53:18,694 --> 01:53:20,060
Abra,

1400
01:53:20,062 --> 01:53:21,664
are you okay?
Where are you?

1401
01:53:22,565 --> 01:53:24,333
I love you.

1402
01:53:26,669 --> 01:53:28,335
When we're safe,

1403
01:53:28,337 --> 01:53:29,303
you'll call her
and tell her where to find us?

1404
01:53:29,305 --> 01:53:30,438
I will.

1405
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:31,607
Okay.

1406
01:54:05,575 --> 01:54:08,009
Not too much further.
Up the mountain.

1407
01:55:43,439 --> 01:55:45,239
Here's what we're gonna do.

1408
01:55:45,241 --> 01:55:48,175
You're gonna stay in the car,
keep the heater running.

1409
01:55:48,177 --> 01:55:50,177
I don't want you spending
a minute inside there

1410
01:55:50,179 --> 01:55:51,412
if you don't have to.

1411
01:55:51,414 --> 01:55:53,213
She can only come from here.

1412
01:55:53,215 --> 01:55:54,615
You can see her
a mile out, easy.

1413
01:55:54,617 --> 01:55:57,151
You see lights
on the mountain over there,

1414
01:55:57,153 --> 01:55:58,719
you blast me, okay?

1415
01:55:58,721 --> 01:56:01,855
But I don't want you going in.
Not until she's here.

1416
01:56:01,857 --> 01:56:04,458
You aren't waiting with me?

1417
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:05,593
I can't.

1418
01:56:05,595 --> 01:56:07,461
Why not?

1419
01:56:07,463 --> 01:56:09,432
I have to wake it up.

1420
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:12,862
Wakey-wakey.

1421
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1422
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1423
02:01:26,015 --> 02:01:28,015
Slow night, Mr. Torrance.

1424
02:01:28,017 --> 02:01:31,685
Not for long, I imagine.

1425
02:01:31,687 --> 02:01:33,754
You're a whiskey man,
are you not?

1426
02:01:33,756 --> 02:01:36,026
I was, most of the time.

1427
02:01:43,565 --> 02:01:45,467
On the house.

1428
02:01:48,737 --> 02:01:50,904
This was your brand.

1429
02:01:50,906 --> 02:01:52,639
Jack Daniel's.

1430
02:01:52,641 --> 02:01:55,043
I used to see the bottles
in our home.

1431
02:01:55,045 --> 02:01:58,578
Our real home,
before all this.

1432
02:01:58,580 --> 02:02:01,817
I smelled one once. It smelled
like something on fire,

1433
02:02:02,952 --> 02:02:05,752
which I suppose it was.

1434
02:02:05,754 --> 02:02:08,156
I'm afraid you've
confused me with someone else.

1435
02:02:08,158 --> 02:02:10,557
It's Lloyd.

1436
02:02:10,559 --> 02:02:11,860
Lloyd.

1437
02:02:12,928 --> 02:02:15,063
I apologize, Mr. Torrance.

1438
02:02:15,065 --> 02:02:16,730
I don't know
where everyone is,

1439
02:02:16,732 --> 02:02:19,033
but it'll pick up.

1440
02:02:19,035 --> 02:02:20,968
Oh, I know where they are.

1441
02:02:20,970 --> 02:02:22,638
And you're right,

1442
02:02:23,306 --> 02:02:24,374
it'll pick up.

1443
02:02:26,542 --> 02:02:29,979
If you don't mind my saying,
Mr. Torrance, you seem...

1444
02:02:30,746 --> 02:02:32,115
put upon.

1445
02:02:32,781 --> 02:02:34,581
Put upon?

1446
02:02:34,583 --> 02:02:36,150
Pulled into
other people's problems.

1447
02:02:36,152 --> 02:02:39,588
I see it all the time,
if you don't mind my saying.

1448
02:02:41,991 --> 02:02:44,227
So we lived in Florida.

1449
02:02:44,927 --> 02:02:46,060
I'm sorry?

1450
02:02:46,062 --> 02:02:47,596
Mom and I.

1451
02:02:49,199 --> 02:02:52,300
We never wanted
to see snow again,

1452
02:02:52,302 --> 02:02:54,268
so we lived in Florida.

1453
02:02:54,270 --> 02:02:55,802
Tiny place,

1454
02:02:55,804 --> 02:02:56,939
but it was comfortable,
and we were happy.

1455
02:02:59,242 --> 02:03:01,742
I was 20 when she died.

1456
02:03:01,744 --> 02:03:05,612
And back then, I saw
when someone was gonna die.

1457
02:03:05,614 --> 02:03:07,848
I saw flies. Black flies.

1458
02:03:07,850 --> 02:03:11,685
"Death flies," I called them,
circling people's faces.

1459
02:03:11,687 --> 02:03:14,322
And in those last weeks,
she was covered,

1460
02:03:14,324 --> 02:03:16,190
her whole face.

1461
02:03:16,192 --> 02:03:19,593
I could barely see her eyes.

1462
02:03:19,595 --> 02:03:22,330
And I...
And I tried to comfort her,

1463
02:03:22,332 --> 02:03:24,298
but I could hardly
look at her.

1464
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:26,635
And she saw that.

1465
02:03:31,673 --> 02:03:35,109
Maybe something warm to push
away such unpleasantries.

1466
02:03:35,111 --> 02:03:38,279
Don't you wanna hear about it?
She was your wife.

1467
02:03:38,281 --> 02:03:41,382
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

1468
02:03:41,384 --> 02:03:43,319
- I'm just a bartender.
- Oh, yeah?

1469
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:46,254
Just Lloyd the bartender,

1470
02:03:46,256 --> 02:03:47,988
pouring joy
at the Overlook Hotel.

1471
02:03:47,990 --> 02:03:51,061
I'll pour whatever you like,
Mr. Torrance.

1472
02:03:57,933 --> 02:03:59,902
Man takes a drink,

1473
02:04:00,903 --> 02:04:03,404
the drink takes a drink,

1474
02:04:03,406 --> 02:04:06,274
and then the drink
takes a man.

1475
02:04:06,276 --> 02:04:08,111
Ain't it so, Dad?

1476
02:04:12,148 --> 02:04:14,117
Medicine.

1477
02:04:15,085 --> 02:04:18,018
Medicine is what it is.

1478
02:04:18,020 --> 02:04:20,887
Bona fide cure-all.

1479
02:04:20,889 --> 02:04:23,790
The mind is a blackboard.

1480
02:04:23,792 --> 02:04:25,393
And this...

1481
02:04:25,395 --> 02:04:27,197
is the eraser.

1482
02:04:32,102 --> 02:04:34,435
A man tries.

1483
02:04:34,437 --> 02:04:36,870
He provides.

1484
02:04:36,872 --> 02:04:39,340
But he's surrounded by mouths.

1485
02:04:39,342 --> 02:04:41,375
And a family.

1486
02:04:41,377 --> 02:04:44,845
A wife, a kid.

1487
02:04:44,847 --> 02:04:47,248
Those mouths eat time.

1488
02:04:47,250 --> 02:04:49,085
They eat your days on earth.

1489
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:51,687
They just gobble them up.

1490
02:04:53,389 --> 02:04:56,923
It's enough
to make a man sick.

1491
02:04:56,925 --> 02:04:57,926
And this...

1492
02:04:59,095 --> 02:05:01,064
is the medicine.

1493
02:05:03,266 --> 02:05:06,234
So, tell me, pup,

1494
02:05:06,236 --> 02:05:09,305
are you gonna
take your medicine?

1495
02:05:13,008 --> 02:05:14,009
I'm not.

1496
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:18,379
<i>Dan!</i>

1497
02:05:18,381 --> 02:05:19,948
<i>She's here.</i>

1498
02:05:37,733 --> 02:05:39,701
Okay.

1499
02:05:53,449 --> 02:05:56,083
This place is sick.

1500
02:05:56,085 --> 02:05:58,486
Sick like my momo was sick.

1501
02:05:58,488 --> 02:06:00,388
It's cancer,

1502
02:06:00,390 --> 02:06:01,957
only worse.

1503
02:06:09,932 --> 02:06:11,232
What do we do now?

1504
02:06:11,234 --> 02:06:13,702
We head inside.
She'll find us.

1505
02:08:03,379 --> 02:08:05,381
Well, well, well.

1506
02:08:07,450 --> 02:08:09,283
Hi there.

1507
02:08:09,285 --> 02:08:12,420
<i>When this starts, run.</i>

1508
02:08:12,422 --> 02:08:15,323
Yes, you run, dear.

1509
02:08:15,325 --> 02:08:17,924
And then I will find you,

1510
02:08:17,926 --> 02:08:23,631
and you will scream for years
until you die.

1511
02:08:23,633 --> 02:08:26,434
We'll see who does
the screaming.

1512
02:08:26,436 --> 02:08:28,135
Oh, we'll see indeed.

1513
02:08:28,137 --> 02:08:30,171
She's right, you know.

1514
02:08:30,173 --> 02:08:32,208
You should be afraid.

1515
02:08:33,042 --> 02:08:35,242
Why is that?

1516
02:08:35,244 --> 02:08:38,045
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

1517
02:08:38,047 --> 02:08:40,982
I'm sorry, who are you,
handsome?

1518
02:08:44,454 --> 02:08:47,923
You're the one who killed
my Crow, aren't you?

1519
02:08:48,957 --> 02:08:49,958
Go.

1520
02:09:51,387 --> 02:09:53,721
Clever.

1521
02:09:53,723 --> 02:09:55,625
You've made some improvements,
haven't you?

1522
02:09:57,193 --> 02:10:00,027
Since the last time
I was in your mind.

1523
02:10:00,029 --> 02:10:02,298
How do you know
we're not in yours?

1524
02:10:16,345 --> 02:10:17,580
Where are you, pup?

1525
02:10:38,434 --> 02:10:40,102
You're gonna die here.

1526
02:10:41,103 --> 02:10:44,238
Mmm. Brave words, dear.

1527
02:10:44,240 --> 02:10:46,507
Is that what you really think?

1528
02:10:46,509 --> 02:10:48,676
You're gonna hurt me?

1529
02:10:48,678 --> 02:10:50,244
Yes.

1530
02:10:57,119 --> 02:11:00,323
You know,
you remind me of myself.

1531
02:11:01,791 --> 02:11:04,124
I can really see it now.

1532
02:11:04,126 --> 02:11:06,660
You've got a darkness
in you, dear.

1533
02:11:06,662 --> 02:11:10,266
I think the only difference
between you and me is time.

1534
02:11:19,742 --> 02:11:21,009
You don't know yet

1535
02:11:21,711 --> 02:11:22,712
what you'd do...

1536
02:11:24,113 --> 02:11:25,181
for more time.

1537
02:11:27,149 --> 02:11:30,520
But I promise you, dear,
oh, you'd be surprised.

1538
02:11:36,125 --> 02:11:38,027
Pain purifies steam.

1539
02:11:39,161 --> 02:11:42,798
Fear, too, so, you understand.

1540
02:11:55,678 --> 02:11:57,211
Hmm.

1541
02:12:02,518 --> 02:12:05,252
I was just like you
when I was younger.

1542
02:12:05,254 --> 02:12:07,721
I was special,

1543
02:12:07,723 --> 02:12:09,290
and alone.

1544
02:12:09,292 --> 02:12:10,724
But I met someone who gave me

1545
02:12:10,726 --> 02:12:12,493
the gift of purpose,
of community,

1546
02:12:12,495 --> 02:12:14,128
and I might have
given you such a gift

1547
02:12:14,130 --> 02:12:17,500
if things would have
gone differently.

1548
02:12:20,369 --> 02:12:22,336
No?

1549
02:12:22,338 --> 02:12:24,338
Defiant, aren't you?

1550
02:12:25,474 --> 02:12:27,174
So much like me.

1551
02:12:27,176 --> 02:12:29,545
Your mind is so...

1552
02:12:32,481 --> 02:12:34,617
This isn't your mind, is it?

1553
02:12:37,219 --> 02:12:39,522
This isn't you at all.

1554
02:12:41,190 --> 02:12:43,626
You're just the bait.

1555
02:12:46,929 --> 02:12:48,130
Enough!

1556
02:12:51,400 --> 02:12:52,401
Run.

1557
02:12:54,704 --> 02:12:57,438
How the hell did we miss you?

1558
02:12:58,808 --> 02:13:00,341
Oh...

1559
02:13:00,343 --> 02:13:02,778
You and I should have
met years ago.

1560
02:13:06,182 --> 02:13:07,183
Danny.

1561
02:13:08,551 --> 02:13:12,353
That's your name, isn't it?

1562
02:13:12,355 --> 02:13:13,887
Well, something happens
to the steam

1563
02:13:13,889 --> 02:13:15,956
when you rubes get older.

1564
02:13:15,958 --> 02:13:18,225
It gets polluted.

1565
02:13:18,227 --> 02:13:19,827
Dirty.

1566
02:13:19,829 --> 02:13:21,130
You know that.

1567
02:13:22,298 --> 02:13:25,199
I see the grease all over you.

1568
02:13:25,201 --> 02:13:27,968
You don't shine
quite the same.

1569
02:13:27,970 --> 02:13:30,539
Growing up spoils that,
I guess.

1570
02:13:32,642 --> 02:13:34,808
Seriously, handsome,

1571
02:13:34,810 --> 02:13:37,480
where have you been hiding?

1572
02:13:40,416 --> 02:13:42,485
I can make you an offer.

1573
02:13:43,619 --> 02:13:45,486
An offer I rarely make.

1574
02:13:45,488 --> 02:13:47,988
Oh, yeah? I can't wait.

1575
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:49,657
Such a gifted boy,

1576
02:13:49,659 --> 02:13:53,794
hiding his light
under a bushel for so long.

1577
02:13:53,796 --> 02:13:58,332
You could live a long,
long time. Live well, too.

1578
02:13:58,334 --> 02:14:02,569
Indulge yourself,
no consequences,

1579
02:14:02,571 --> 02:14:03,606
no hangovers.

1580
02:14:06,008 --> 02:14:08,776
Eat well, live long.

1581
02:14:08,778 --> 02:14:11,679
You must be lonely,
being the last one.

1582
02:14:11,681 --> 02:14:13,881
I mean,
the last one in the world.

1583
02:14:13,883 --> 02:14:16,519
Sweetie, I'm not the last.
Far from it.

1584
02:14:17,653 --> 02:14:19,520
I'm just the prettiest.

1585
02:14:19,522 --> 02:14:21,590
I assume you know my answer.

1586
02:14:23,359 --> 02:14:24,491
Pity.

1587
02:14:24,493 --> 02:14:26,262
So, are we doing this or not?

1588
02:14:42,778 --> 02:14:44,411
Whew.

1589
02:14:46,649 --> 02:14:48,982
Oh, sweetie.

1590
02:14:48,984 --> 02:14:52,753
Oh, look at that, huh?

1591
02:14:52,755 --> 02:14:56,957
I seem to have nicked
your femoral artery there.

1592
02:14:56,959 --> 02:14:59,693
Why, you're gonna
bleed to death, huh?

1593
02:15:05,401 --> 02:15:07,434
My, my,
what a temper you have.

1594
02:15:07,436 --> 02:15:08,537
So much fire.

1595
02:15:09,405 --> 02:15:10,971
Such a waste!

1596
02:15:10,973 --> 02:15:12,639
Or maybe not.

1597
02:15:19,682 --> 02:15:22,015
Oh, damn.

1598
02:15:22,017 --> 02:15:24,618
Even at your age...

1599
02:15:24,620 --> 02:15:26,322
it's so good.

1600
02:15:31,393 --> 02:15:33,395
You taste like whiskey.

1601
02:15:38,601 --> 02:15:40,002
Danny!

1602
02:15:40,870 --> 02:15:42,304
Danny boy!

1603
02:15:43,439 --> 02:15:45,873
Oh, so much terror.

1604
02:15:45,875 --> 02:15:47,641
All your life, huh?

1605
02:15:49,945 --> 02:15:51,714
Delicious.

1606
02:15:57,586 --> 02:15:59,955
Don't hurt me!

1607
02:16:01,690 --> 02:16:02,691
Oh, damn.

1608
02:16:07,463 --> 02:16:08,762
What are...
You're not alone in there.

1609
02:16:08,764 --> 02:16:09,965
Huh?

1610
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,501
What are you hiding, huh?

1611
02:16:14,770 --> 02:16:16,670
What's in those?

1612
02:16:16,672 --> 02:16:18,106
Something special, huh?

1613
02:16:18,108 --> 02:16:21,710
They're not special.
They're starving.

1614
02:16:30,653 --> 02:16:31,819
No.

1615
02:16:31,821 --> 02:16:33,821
No!

1616
02:17:10,759 --> 02:17:12,693
Hello, Danny.

1617
02:17:14,663 --> 02:17:17,067
Come and play with us...

1618
02:17:18,168 --> 02:17:19,833
forever...

1619
02:17:19,835 --> 02:17:22,504
...and ever...

1620
02:17:23,606 --> 02:17:25,474
and ever.

1621
02:17:59,775 --> 02:18:02,110
Uncle Dan.

1622
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:03,877
Uncle Dan, is it done?

1623
02:18:03,879 --> 02:18:06,149
Is she dead?

1624
02:18:28,138 --> 02:18:30,671
Great party, isn't it?

1625
02:18:30,673 --> 02:18:31,974
Abra!

1626
02:18:35,678 --> 02:18:37,047
Abra!

1627
02:18:53,229 --> 02:18:54,763
Abra!

1628
02:19:01,071 --> 02:19:02,638
Abra!

1629
02:19:21,057 --> 02:19:22,524
Try it.

1630
02:19:25,561 --> 02:19:26,927
Oh, there you are.

1631
02:19:26,929 --> 02:19:28,164
Abra.

1632
02:19:29,299 --> 02:19:32,066
You've been very, very bad.

1633
02:19:32,068 --> 02:19:34,235
You're not Uncle Dan.

1634
02:19:34,237 --> 02:19:38,572
You're a mask. A false face.

1635
02:19:38,574 --> 02:19:39,806
Who else would I be?

1636
02:19:39,808 --> 02:19:40,809
You're the hotel.

1637
02:19:41,677 --> 02:19:43,077
But he's still in there.

1638
02:19:43,079 --> 02:19:44,847
Mask is off, then.

1639
02:19:49,618 --> 02:19:51,718
Why are you smiling?

1640
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:53,887
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

1641
02:19:53,889 --> 02:19:57,824
I know these halls
like my own face, child.

1642
02:19:57,826 --> 02:20:00,028
I mean the body
you're standing in.

1643
02:20:00,030 --> 02:20:01,728
The face you're wearing.

1644
02:20:01,730 --> 02:20:03,964
That's Dan Torrance,
and you don't know him.

1645
02:20:03,966 --> 02:20:05,766
Dan Torrance.

1646
02:20:05,768 --> 02:20:07,135
Dan Torrance

1647
02:20:07,137 --> 02:20:10,204
made one stop
as soon as he got here.

1648
02:20:10,206 --> 02:20:11,807
To the boiler room.

1649
02:20:36,732 --> 02:20:40,234
There you are.

1650
02:20:40,236 --> 02:20:42,070
You were supposed to run.

1651
02:20:42,072 --> 02:20:43,770
I didn't wanna leave you.

1652
02:20:46,642 --> 02:20:50,244
I'm exactly where
I'm supposed to be.

1653
02:20:50,246 --> 02:20:51,912
I can't hold it off
for much longer.

1654
02:20:51,914 --> 02:20:53,114
Abra, you need to run.

1655
02:20:53,116 --> 02:20:54,382
No.

1656
02:20:54,384 --> 02:20:56,050
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

1657
02:20:56,052 --> 02:20:58,620
I have to close the door
behind us, right?

1658
02:20:59,355 --> 02:21:01,055
Run! Run!

1659
02:23:15,258 --> 02:23:16,359
Come on, Uncle Dan.

1660
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:18,428
Get out of there.

1661
02:23:19,861 --> 02:23:21,064
Come on.

1662
02:23:32,508 --> 02:23:35,008
<i>The fire spread fast,</i>

1663
02:23:35,010 --> 02:23:37,010
<i>destroying the hotel.</i>

1664
02:23:37,012 --> 02:23:38,481
<i>Purifying it.</i>

1665
02:23:40,015 --> 02:23:42,083
I could almost hear it

1666
02:23:42,085 --> 02:23:43,353
screaming.

1667
02:23:44,354 --> 02:23:47,020
I could hear it dying.

1668
02:23:47,022 --> 02:23:49,858
And deep inside, I knew...

1669
02:23:52,495 --> 02:23:54,464
I knew you were okay.

1670
02:23:55,931 --> 02:23:58,932
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

1671
02:23:58,934 --> 02:24:00,336
It was the only way.

1672
02:24:01,271 --> 02:24:02,472
I know.

1673
02:24:03,573 --> 02:24:06,973
Do you think she was right

1674
02:24:06,975 --> 02:24:10,211
when she said
she wasn't the last one?

1675
02:24:10,213 --> 02:24:12,446
The world's a hungry place.

1676
02:24:12,448 --> 02:24:15,116
A dark place.

1677
02:24:15,118 --> 02:24:18,952
Maybe there's more of them
or things like them or worse,

1678
02:24:18,954 --> 02:24:21,422
but there are more people
like you, too.

1679
02:24:21,424 --> 02:24:23,192
People who stand.

1680
02:24:26,596 --> 02:24:28,396
I told you
when I first met you...

1681
02:24:28,398 --> 02:24:31,167
I told you
that you should hide.

1682
02:24:32,635 --> 02:24:34,836
That you should
keep your head down.

1683
02:24:35,904 --> 02:24:38,074
Keep your shine out of sight.

1684
02:24:39,642 --> 02:24:41,210
But I was wrong.

1685
02:24:44,380 --> 02:24:46,549
Shine on, Abra Stone.

1686
02:24:49,218 --> 02:24:50,553
You shine on.

1687
02:24:53,489 --> 02:24:55,325
Dinner's ready.

1688
02:24:58,461 --> 02:25:00,296
Who are you talking to?

1689
02:25:02,265 --> 02:25:03,266
No one.

1690
02:25:03,965 --> 02:25:04,966
Hmm.

1691
02:25:11,474 --> 02:25:13,076
That's not true.

1692
02:25:17,046 --> 02:25:18,414
I was talking to Dan.

1693
02:25:26,322 --> 02:25:28,458
We go on after.

1694
02:25:29,325 --> 02:25:30,493
We go on.

1695
02:25:31,260 --> 02:25:32,861
And he's okay.

1696
02:25:33,496 --> 02:25:34,497
So is Daddy.

1697
02:25:36,165 --> 02:25:37,367
He really is.

1698
02:25:41,371 --> 02:25:42,904
Good.

1699
02:25:54,250 --> 02:25:55,551
You coming, sweetheart?

1700
02:25:58,321 --> 02:25:59,655
In a minute.

1701
02:26:20,358 --> 02:26:25,358
