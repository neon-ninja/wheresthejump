COMMUNION

3
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,913
Someone is here.

4
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,331
Mm...

5
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,169
Darling...
Come to bed.

6
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,250
Knock-knock.

7
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,754
She says... he says...

8
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,840
I like this. OK.

9
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,300
Really, because, you know, I like
a "knock-knock" joking.

10
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,719
You can do...

11
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,054
I can do "knock-knock" to...

12
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:39,659
<i>Based on the true experiences</i>
<i>of one American family.</i>

13
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,043
New York, 1985.

14
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,144
Download.

15
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,445
Get up!

16
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,405
I'm cookin', Im cookin'...

17
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,656
I'm on the roll.

18
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,117
What's the matter with you?

19
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,327
Boo!

20
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,457
Where is dad?

21
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,293
I don't know, office maybe...

22
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,381
-Whitley!
-Oh, now I have you.

23
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,216
I got you! Got you, baby!

24
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,344
What's the problem, the computer or you?

25
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Today was everything, I tell you.
It was full scale revolution, total war...
Terrible day.
What a day, what a day, what a...!

26
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,729
Hey hey, what's the matter?
Give me a kiss!

27
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,023
There is something wrong with you?

28
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,652
I had such a terrible day.

29
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,654
First the computer turnes off,

30
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,074
then the wolf painting jumps off the wall.

31
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,535
It attacks me without provocation.

32
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,287
Then your mother calls that toilet explodes.

33
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,332
The duck I'm cooking tries to tell me
how to live my life.

34
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,044
The computer completely erased itself
when it turned off.

35
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:17,590
No wonder that I can't write my great
American novel.

36
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,387
Is this mean you're too tired
to go to the country?

37
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,348
No, it is simply not.

38
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,600
What did you loose?

39
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:33,148
I lost... you know, I lost another day, what I lost
was gold, golden notions... erased small dreams,

40
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,775
phantoms...
What I crave is... you know

41
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,403
...consolation.

42
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,492
Oh, brother...

43
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,955
You know, it could be the computer
turned off for a reason.

44
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,623
Why would that be?

45
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,460
It could be...

46
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,629
I felt that the book I'm...

47
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,506
working on is no good.

48
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,217
What why you do that to yourself?

49
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,887
It was a rotten accident.

50
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,018
-Once the duck...
-We'll get go out of fire stairs?

51
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,228
Not again...

52
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,814
-Give me something.
-Here, here. - Just give me something.

53
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,025
You got need some water.

54
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,861
...something to put on it.

55
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,654
I need to turn it off.

56
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,075
What the code is?
664... 6664...?

57
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,328
-It's 18-... 57
-Don't... don't... don't...! Please!

58
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,497
The year we were married.

59
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,541
Don't... The red light is on!
Oh no...

60
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,585
Remember what happened last time.

61
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,713
Oh God... do you get the door?

62
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,257
I'm sorry, we get...
we get the little...

63
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,843
small catastrophy...

64
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,764
What's the matter?

65
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,725
What isn't the matter,
will you look at this?

66
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,561
Open the window.

67
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,190
Get some air in here.

68
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,442
Could you save me? I married this.

69
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,737
Open the window over there, please!

70
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,951
We are not going to the country, right?

71
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,580
I know, the last time...

72
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,374
-That's it, heh?
-That's it.

73
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,333
Hi, Al.

74
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,837
-That's the fire?
-It's just food. Food.

75
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:20,922
The duck.

76
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,299
Really?

77
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,093
That.... burned the duck.

78
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,013
891 Feetstreet...

79
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,558
-It shouldn't happen...
-23, repeat, is a 23...

80
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,271
-You've been warned before.
-I know. I'm sorry.

81
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,648
You'll receive your summons
in the mail.

82
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,067
-This stuff is so sensitive...
-200 dollars.

83
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,777
No, stop!

84
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,446
New policies.

85
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,656
It just goes off, I don't know what happened...
Thank you.

86
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,534
-Back to the station!
-Thank you!

87
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,289
Let your wife cook.

88
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,042
Dad, turn this thing off!

89
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,390
3-9-27-81,
I know what it is.

90
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,977
It's a geometric, not arithmetical.

91
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,481
-It's your birthday?
-It also does not work.

92
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,358
You never have that learned here before.

93
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,195
Ah, you see? You see?
Anne this had a making work.

94
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,906
Just read the instruction.

95
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,763
Dad...?

96
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,224
Dad?

97
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,770
Dad!

98
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,189
Dad!

99
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,400
-What's up?
-Spider!

100
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,026
What?!

101
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,196
Go on, kill it!

102
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,365
Kill it!

103
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,493
-Oh, that is a big one.
-Here it is, here it is.

104
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,706
Now it's in your pants!

105
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,584
Alex, do something!

106
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,795
Now it's on you!

107
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,381
Just a peacefull night in the country.

108
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,717
There it going to sleep now, with you.

109
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:11,926
Will sing to you.

110
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,765
If you leave the room in form rigt back
in usually it's gone.

111
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,893
I'm glad...

112
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:23,104
that this is no my room.

113
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,150
Have a nice night.

114
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,320
You know...

115
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,948
...it may not have been
what a spider I saw.

116
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,873
Say something dirty.

117
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,416
-Socks.
-Come on...

118
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,002
Say... say erect...
Can you say: erection?

119
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,587
I'll never say it!

120
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,177
What do you think he's doing?
Alex?

121
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,136
What do you mean what I think he's doing?

122
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,431
I know what he's doing. He's doing
the old Romanian turn on, he's a singer.

123
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,225
Sing of the wolves.

124
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:05,730
I sing of the wolves... that...
You know I see the dark beautiful forests...

125
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,692
And she's like this...
She's like this.

126
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,946
In the night there would be
only silence.

127
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,658
And there you'll have the wolves.

128
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,620
In there are no wolves here.

129
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,836
I wonder is there ghosts.

130
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,547
The house is new.

131
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:34,009
No, I mean the ghosts of the wolves.

132
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,595
The ones that have been killed.

133
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,061
Stop it.

134
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,522
No, quiet, quiet...

135
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,362
So, you wanna fool around?

136
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,573
-You look good.
-Thanks.

137
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,367
It's been an ice age
I've missed you...

138
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,745
...you old ball and chain.

139
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,591
Is that someone there?

140
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

141
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

142
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,009
Hey, hey, wow...

143
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,427
What's the matter, boss?
What's the matter?

144
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,595
-There was something here!
-Shake it up, come on.

145
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:48,722
Something very bad!

146
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,890
Wow, it was the nightmare.

147
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,977
No, no dad.

148
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,941
-It was the nightmare.
-They had me, dad.

149
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:05,363
Nightmares do that. You know, sometimes, I mean...
If it didn't do that, that wouldn't be a nightmare... You know what I mean?

150
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,410
Daddies... daddies get the boys back, right?

151
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,661
Yeah...

152
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,455
Do you know any songs?

153
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,709
Do you know any indian hunting songs?

154
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,630
Do you know the old buffalo hunting song?

155
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:38,063
...and cocktails for two.

156
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,025
That's a good boy.
Go to sleep.

157
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,612
He was yelling, you didn't hear
he was yelling.

158
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,281
-You were yelling? Where was I?
-He had some bad dream I told you.

159
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,117
I had a bad dream too.

160
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,954
I was some sound of sleep...
I... I was asleep.

161
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,166
You were out. Like a log.

162
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:04,005
He said something was after him, some spider, huh?
Like a spider from last night?

163
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:07,217
It was real, dad.

164
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,260
Worst dream you ever had.

165
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,680
It wasn't a dream.

166
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,100
I'm not surprised about you, Whit.

167
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:19,437
You ate away till this
table last night.

168
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,147
I didn't eat to get up the stairs.

169
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,441
What's a good thing it was nothing. I wonder...

170
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:28,238
I pay fortune for this equipment.
Some animal must to set it all.

171
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,407
How do you sleep?

172
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,033
Well...

173
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,537
We saw a lot of light last night.

174
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,499
Whitley has that machine finally tuned.

175
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,376
Mosquito did set it all.

176
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:45,255
No, really there were a lot of lights,
it was very hard to sleep.

177
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,507
It's been the light from the bathroom.

178
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,176
No, it was light there came in from outside.

179
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,304
I can't believe you didn't see it,
it was like day.

180
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,598
I thought there was a fire outside,
in fact.

181
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,769
I came downstairs, you know...
there was light... it was this light.

182
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,647
But then... it must...

183
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:09,446
The flood lights were on there...
it was the moon maybe.

184
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:16,578
We were all dreaming, you know, on the moon
we all got involve in the same dream.

185
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,498
It wasn't the moon.

186
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,625
So was a dream.

187
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,420
This whole place was flooded
with the light from above.

188
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,172
It wasn't a dream.

189
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,299
So was the moon.

190
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,884
Oh, it wasn't the moon.

191
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,596
And it wasn't a dream.
I'm telling it what we saw.

192
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,146
Well...

193
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:51,696
So, why don't you have your usual huge
portion of... banana cakes?

194
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,534
Aromatic component...

195
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,754
OK. I want to go home.

196
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,883
I'm sorry, I'm not angry.
I can't explain.

197
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,094
Whitley, I want you to take us back today.

198
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,805
Come on, Alex. Give me a break.

199
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,265
I know I did not see the moon.

200
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,059
I want to go home.

201
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,895
Alex, what's the four letter word,
for the...

202
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,898
Take us home, Whitley!

203
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,444
Please, forgive me.

204
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,571
It's cool.

205
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,199
Would you... clean up, then we'll go.

206
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,451
We had the really rough night.

207
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,912
-Are you kidding?
-What's going on?

208
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:54,175
I don't know why we doing this.
Why...

209
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,804
It's crazy. You know.

210
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,810
Thank you for taking us home.

211
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,687
It's fine.

212
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,356
We could have taken the bus, Whitley.
Really.

213
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,608
There is no bus.

214
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,987
There is not even the bus station.

215
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:38,219
There were wolves in the closet, wolves in the base,
and wolves all over the place.

216
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,558
They work in advertising, they sell
junk food and beer.

217
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:47,020
The gigantic hamburgers, and their tank cold beers,

218
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:50,899
for the baseball games on the TV,
and the bags of the potato cheaps,

219
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:54,527
whitch were big enough to feed a horse.

220
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,904
They have a lot of fun.

221
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,864
There go the baseball games.
They had...

222
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,157
Get dressed!

223
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,825
I don't feel like it...

224
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,411
I all them lovely get hurt.

225
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,539
Come on, come on! Got ten minutes
to be allready Greenbergs. Andy's waiting.

226
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:11,127
Crack the whip.
Drive the slaves off to another cocktail party.

227
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:14,964
Make them bubble about glass nose.
That'll lost another day here...

228
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,467
He needs you.
He is over sensitive today...

229
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,177
in the funny mood.

230
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,470
What's the matter?

231
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:21,888
I don't know. He...

232
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:25,433
He overreacted this clean at school,
he won't talk to me, I'm a girl.

233
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,102
Here, put this on...

234
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,979
take this off...

235
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,359
You're going to be an elephant.
You prommissed him.

236
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,862
Is this the front...?

237
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,532
-...or the rear?
-I don't know.

238
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:44,452
You'll put your grey turtleneck on.
Elephants are grey.

239
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,914
-Put your pants on, come on, let's go.
-It's me!

240
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:10,854
OK! Remember! Only treat, no tricks.

241
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:11,980
Yeah!

242
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:17,694
Get your bags to the door!
God, help the rest to the building.

243
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,922
-Bye-bye!
-Bye!

244
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,930
-Thanks a lot, Jake. Sorry about the mess.
-You're welcome.

245
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:51,061
-You can take off the nose.
-What's the matter, you know, I .... nose, how come I can any fun?

246
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,813
The other dads have noses.

247
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,440
Put this on ice......

248
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:57,859
You can use this, it's clean.

249
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:58,735
OK, guys...

250
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,237
-See you later. - All right.
-Come on! Let's go to work!

251
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,531

-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

252
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:07,077
Bye guys, see you later!

253
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,830
Don't fear, right?
I'm starting get scared.

254
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,542
I'm starting get scared now...

255
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,461
Witch way in there?

256
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:26,012
I think, we're expect to go down there.

257
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,643
Zoom...

258
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:16,479
Trick or treat...?

259
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,235
Get away!

260
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,946
What... what you... what you...!

261
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,197
Stay away from me!

262
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,866
No more!

263
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:31,161
Are you crazy? What's the wrong?

264
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,496
It's the Halloween show.

265
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:38,793
What's the matter with you, you're going mad, guy.

266
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:39,961
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

267
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:41,838
Please, leave us alone.

268
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:55,352
Am I in the dog house or what?

269
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:01,232
Danny, say good night to a father.

270
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:08,990
We're going put our son to bed
ant then we're going to talk.

271
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,951
-Oh, wanderfull.
-No, it won't be wonderful.

272
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,661
But it's needed.

273
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,209
That guy went crazy.

274
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,171
Not my fault.

275
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:29,636
Here we go.

276
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,805
How old are you?

277
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,140
I overreacted.

278
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:37,310
What's going on with you?
What's happening?

279
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:40,772
-What's happen to you...
-I got scared.

280
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,691
What do you take me for?

281
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:46,236
What do you think,
I don't know what you do?

282
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,364
You haven't problems with your writing?

283
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:51,741
You're so fine,
you're terrified our son tonight.

284
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,703
I scared myself too.

285
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You're frightened by the halloween mask.
Mhm. Yes.
A halloween mask frightened you.

286
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,670
Is there an echo?

287
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:06,006
Yes.

288
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,466
What do I must to say that,
What am I...

289
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:11,011
I don't know.

290
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:15,640
Why were had you been frightened
of a rubber mask?

291
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:19,102
It's like I've seen it.

292
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:22,188
Alive... real.

293
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:25,775
What do you think you do this to me...

294
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:28,737
Peng... zoom.

295
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:31,448
I've got one child.
I don't need another.

296
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,033
You're await.

297
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:36,703
You don't say anything word about it,
I won't.

298
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:08,401
This time something was here.
I'm sure.

299
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,327
We're alone.

300
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,296
-What you're doing?
-Same old thing.

301
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,799
Then working?

302
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:33,718
I got no ideas.

303
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:36,471
God, but this place is on mess.
How could you work here.

304
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:39,099
-I will clean it.
-Leave it that way. I like it that way.

305
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:42,727
I like my work place were crossed.

306
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:45,897
I told you, don't touch my stuff!

307
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:50,026
You know, you're used to be funny.

308
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:56,241
Welcome to the Saint Mark's
T.... School ..... great rable!

309
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,704
Andrew, that was wanderfull.

310
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:44,581
-Thanks a lot, guy.
-That was really wonderful.

311
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:48,626
That's why I call dishing out
some Christmas spirit.

312
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:52,297
Why are we sad?

313
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:54,674
Andy, what do you thing to say?

314
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:56,301
We are.

315
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:58,470
We start the great time.

316
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:01,514
But... dad's sad.

317
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:06,895
I'm in tough time, you know.
In my writing...

318
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:11,649
But won't we have fun
Santa's comming in just a few days?

319
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:15,570
That's right, Santa is comming and,
you know, it's gonna be great.

320
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:32,003
Not too fast! I'm trying to...

321
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,345
-Allright?
-Yeah, oo, I think so.

322
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:46,935
I asked Santa for professional model,
he sure gave me a professional model, allright.

323
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:52,273
-Santa knows.
-I think Santa knows just about everything, don't you, dad?

324
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:29,853
Who writes this?

325
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,938
Take off your cloth.

326
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:35,275
Let's go on another room and do it.

327
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:30,455
Is that someone there?

328
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:37,689
Hey, honey...

329
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:50,285
Was there an owl in here last night?

330
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:53,913
-An owl?
-I thought I saw an owl...

331
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,665
Where?

332
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:58,585
While comming the window.

333
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:01,129
They were closed.

334
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:04,466
It'll still be here,
I guess.

335
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,887
Aren't you cold?

336
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:11,848
Must have been a dream.

337
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:14,976
Hack of a dream.

338
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,438
Let me tell you some one more thing
about grizzly bears...

339
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:23,943
That not only do they get as big as vox wagons...
but they also...

340
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:28,198
...they can run 30 miles an hour.

341
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:31,242
And they get also chase you up a tree.

342
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:33,828
The truck's end.

343
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:37,665
There's a big foot...

344
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,629
I don't feel good.

345
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:43,505
What?

346
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:46,633
-Come on dad, let's go.
-I just don't... I don't feel good.

347
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,886
-Dad, let's go!
-My head aches... behind.

348
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:52,472
Daddy you're OK now, let's go.

349
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:55,183
What's the matter?

350
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,520
You've got a little mark there, a litte...

351
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:00,105
Dad, let's go.

352
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,107
You bit something spider by.

353
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:03,274
Daddy, come on...

354
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:04,901
-It's a hurt when I'm pressing?
-Yes!

355
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:06,986
Oh, I'm sorry.

356
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,531
You're allright?

357
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,994
Go here...

358
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,455
I'll go home.

359
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:20,583
Hey, wait for... wait a second.

360
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:01,833
What's the matter with you?

361
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,918
Are you through?

362
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:06,629
You're scared?
Really you are?

363
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:09,049
I'm not scared.

364
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:10,216
Where are you?

365
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:13,720
Well, I'll check out the house,
something's wrong...

366
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:17,724
Oh, you're going to check out the house?
Why don't you stay right here.

367
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:21,936
-Why you get thought like that?
-Put your back over here in bed.

368
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:25,106
What's the matter with you?

369
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:28,401
........ you scared a cloud passed over the moon.
There was a cloud.

370
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:31,988
It's a clear night.
What are you talking about, what cloud?

371
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:33,656
There is no cloud, what are you talking about!

372
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,575
-What cloud!
-Who get scared just clouds over the moon?

373
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:38,453
Why are you get talk like that!

374
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:43,917

00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:47,671

383
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:12,529
What the hell you think you're doing...
Stupid fucking.....

384
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:14,739
Go to hell.

385
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:05,326
What's going on out here?

386
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:09,789
-Are you shootining, dad?
-Come on.

387
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:34,439
I... I think that I call Sam Freeman
in the morning.

388
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:48,119
I didn't know was you.
That's all.

389
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:49,913
I didn't know.

390
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:04,761
What about this, here?

391
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:12,394
-Just where you had the injury?
-Yeah.

392
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:16,564
It's a little red.

393
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:20,819
Two days ago. Hurt so bad I thought
my head's going explode.

394
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:23,363
It's fine now.

395
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:25,448
You can dress.

396
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:31,329
I've been goin' on the notion in there
with some kind of hallucination, you know.

397
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:32,789
Nightmare.

398
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:36,835
I speak of it, you know.
I've got to say it feels real.

399
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:42,382
There was as needle it stuck me
on the back of the head. With the needle.

400
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:45,385
That's the mark that I've tried
to show you.

401
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:46,970
And there is a matk there.

402
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:49,723
You told her about all this?

403
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:53,309
What am I suppose to tell her? What is to say,
I have to know what happened to me...

404
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,895
before I could say something.
I can't say I'm ...

405
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,940
I'm loosing my marble suddenly
out of the clear blue sky...

406
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:00,775
There is no reason for this.

407
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:04,070
I think the psychiatrist will help you.

408
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,252
-Hi.
-Hallo.

409
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:22,380
Where have you been?

410
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:24,591
Took a walk.

411
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,890
What did Sam say?

412
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:34,976
Sam's fine, and he sends his love.

413
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:37,687
-Want some of this?
-No, thank you.

414
00:40:37,854 --> 00:40:41,274
He said he is sending me to a shrinker.

415
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:43,276
Good.

416
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:48,573
It's a woman who specializes in...
would you believe, rape cases.

417
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:53,495
-You want something to drink?
-No.

418
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:58,583
-Rape cases?
-Remember that mark I have in there?

419
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,586
Yeah.

420
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:06,091
Well, I feel certainly I was given a shot.

421
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:09,678
You were... a...

422
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:14,057
When you... a...

423
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:18,228
Wait a minute. Hold it.

424
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:20,313
Sam gave you a shot.

425
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,815
No.

426
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:26,152
That night, after Christmas.

427
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:30,573
The night that I...
OK, here it goes.

428
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,618
When I saw them.

429
00:41:35,036 --> 00:41:37,706
Where'd you saw who?

430
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:46,006
Someone came for me that night.

431
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:48,425
Who came for you?

432
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:51,469
Somebody came into the house.

433
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,347
Wait a minute, what did you say?

434
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:58,143
Somebody came into the house,
then took me, and...

435
00:42:01,062 --> 00:42:04,482
they gave me a shot in the back of my scull...

436
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:07,068
and...

437
00:42:07,235 --> 00:42:09,946
This is ridiculous... they were...

438
00:42:10,238 --> 00:42:13,199
smal, bluish skin and...

439
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:15,910
...they were others.

440
00:42:16,077 --> 00:42:19,873
One thin faces and big eyes...

441
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:22,334
and...

442
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:25,962
this is the tough part...

443
00:42:26,129 --> 00:42:29,341
they did not appear to be...

444
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:31,051
a human.

445
00:42:34,095 --> 00:42:36,556
I'm sorry. What?

446
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,852
Sam... you know, he...

447
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:43,855
I don't know what he thinks...

448
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:47,442
but I think I'm hallucinating.

449
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:54,491
Major maybe psychotic... hallucinations.

450
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:00,038
So, that's it...

451
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:02,207
what I...

452
00:43:02,624 --> 00:43:05,502
have been trying to say...

453
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:08,296
in knot shell.

454
00:43:25,146 --> 00:43:28,400
You guys went out to lost me
whith a little while ago...

455
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:30,902
We just went out for a second.

456
00:43:31,194 --> 00:43:33,488
We said to get some air.

457
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:37,742
Go haven't you no argument
you forgot me.

458
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:41,538
I would never forget you.

459
00:43:42,038 --> 00:43:44,165
That's good, stay it is...

460
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:49,379
And now, you jelly bean,
go to sleep.

461
00:43:52,924 --> 00:43:56,136
Mummie, is God real?

462
00:43:56,761 --> 00:43:59,180
I think so.

463
00:44:00,098 --> 00:44:03,018
I hope so.

464
00:44:04,894 --> 00:44:08,023
But nobody knows for sure?

465
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:10,483
No.

466
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,945
Actually they don't. Nobody knows.

467
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:20,410
So we are alone,
except these little blue doctors?

468
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,414
Who are the little blue doctors?

469
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:28,835
They come to the cabin.
They have big black eyes.

470
00:44:29,252 --> 00:44:31,046
They're really scary.

471
00:44:31,212 --> 00:44:36,134
They said "We won't hurt you", but
I'd pray for them to go away.

472
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:42,432
But they just keep shining their lights on me.
God didn't make them go away.

473
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:47,228
Can I dream dad's dreams?

474
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:52,025
-I'm Janet Duffy.
-Hi, Anne Strieber.

475
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:54,027
Hallo.

476
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:55,820
Whitley.

477
00:44:55,987 --> 00:44:56,780
Yes.

478
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,740
Sit down.

479
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:01,701
Sam and I've allready talked.

480
00:45:01,868 --> 00:45:04,412
You're comfortable beeing here together?

481
00:45:04,537 --> 00:45:06,623
Sure.

482
00:45:07,665 --> 00:45:08,291
Yes.

483
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:11,127
Good.
A healthy sign.

484
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,171
So...

485
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:18,093
So, Sam told you that I'm seeing a small people
coming into my house...

486
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:21,179
and they take me away in this kind of thing...
and...

487
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:24,974
-Do you drink?
-Yeah, sure. But that's not...

488
00:45:25,183 --> 00:45:29,521
-Drugs?
-No. As a kid, you know, the usual thing, but that's...

489
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:31,773
I'm way too old for that.

490
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,360
Hallucinations? Flights of imagination?

491
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:40,281
Just the occasional delusion of grandiose.

492
00:45:44,452 --> 00:45:47,330
Tell me what happened to you?

493
00:45:47,455 --> 00:45:51,418
What can I say? These little blue .....
come into my house.

494
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:54,254
They... this's rediculous...

495
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:58,550
They took me out of the house,
and they stuck a needle in my head...

496
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:02,971
and I had some kind of rectal probe.

497
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:04,973
This happened when?

498
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,976
Day after Christmas.

499
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:10,937
Right? It was on 26ht.

500
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:13,857
Any disturbances ...........?

501
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:15,859
No!

502
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,819
He does worry about prowlers.

503
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:20,196
Place is isolated.

504
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:23,074
But there haven't been any actual prowlers?

505
00:46:23,241 --> 00:46:27,037
No. Sounds and these like that,
you know, nothing that you could...

506
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,416
No. Nothing that you could identify.

507
00:46:31,499 --> 00:46:35,045
There was one weekend in october.

508
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:39,674
We had friends up, Alex and Sara.

509
00:46:40,258 --> 00:46:44,763
They saw something that scared them
so much, that they left.

510
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:46,931
They saw lights. You saw them too.

511
00:46:47,098 --> 00:46:49,559
There was light all over the place.

512
00:46:49,726 --> 00:46:53,897
They got so scared, that they left the next day.

513
00:46:56,816 --> 00:47:01,279
But I... I have all this
very sensitive equipment.

514
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,407
Lights and...

515
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:08,036
burglar top things...

516
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:11,790
So you discussed it, you investigated it?

517
00:47:11,998 --> 00:47:15,877
We didn't... investigate?
There was nothing to investigate.

518
00:47:16,836 --> 00:47:19,089
So what scared them? What happened?

519
00:47:19,255 --> 00:47:22,759
I'm talking about it and I have no idea.

520
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:29,724
I have no idea. I have no idea why I'm here,
I don't know what I'm doing.

521
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:31,476
You know, talking about this.

522
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:37,941
I saw something... they saw something...

523
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:45,824
There was a lot of light.

524
00:47:46,157 --> 00:47:48,034
That's all I remember.

525
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:52,247
It seems to me, that the overall vagueness
of your memory suggest...

526
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:55,166
we may clarify them a little bit by hypnosis.

527
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,876
Would you be agreeable to that?

528
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:58,294
Hypnosis?

529
00:47:58,461 --> 00:48:00,505
It's a simple process.

530
00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:04,592
It's sometimes very helpful in cases
of psychological trauma,

531
00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:08,680
when people have difficulty remembering
what hapenned to them.

532
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:14,769
I'd stick pence in my eyeballs before I'd look
that... that ........... woman fool with me.

533
00:48:14,936 --> 00:48:17,605
This woman is approve.

534
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:21,484
Sam sent you two worth of evidences
accepted in court.

535
00:48:21,651 --> 00:48:24,195
Did you listen to her?

536
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:25,905
What do you mean I did listen to her?

537
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:28,616
Why should I pay someone to talk to me?

538
00:48:28,783 --> 00:48:30,118
Because you fire God damned gun....!

539
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,537
I'm allright with thing in her!

540
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:33,955
She should pay me!

541
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:38,168
Selfish prick.
Sit up and talk to me!

542
00:48:38,626 --> 00:48:40,628
I'd rather be dead.

543
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:43,298
I'm gonna tell you something:

544
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:46,760
You got to go back in that woman's office,
we gonna find out what's wrong with you...

545
00:48:46,926 --> 00:48:50,305
while I can having marriage left.

546
00:48:51,931 --> 00:48:54,476
I'm sitting up! I'm sitting...

547
00:48:55,852 --> 00:48:59,272
I'm sitting. So, you know, lighten up.

548
00:49:01,566 --> 00:49:03,568
Crazy women...

549
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:05,612
So, what do i do?

550
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:07,739
What should I do?
Where would you like me to go?

551
00:49:07,822 --> 00:49:11,201
It's best he'll be alone his first time.

552
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:21,169
So?

553
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:23,630
It's not exactly the electric chair.

554
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:29,469
Listen to me Whitley.
Look up at my finger.

555
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:33,598
That's it. Keep looking at my finger.

556
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:38,395
I'm going to count to ten,
as you're falling asleep.

557
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:42,357
And when I'm finnished, you're be
deeply, deeply asleep.

558
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:46,069
One... falling asleep,

559
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:49,447
two... falling asleep,

560
00:49:50,657 --> 00:49:53,785
thee... falling asleep,

561
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:57,789
four... falling asleep,

562
00:50:01,126 --> 00:50:04,004
five... falling asleep,

563
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,216
Whitley?

564
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:16,224
Whitley, let's go back to that first time,
the night of october 4th...

565
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:18,476
last october 4th

566
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:20,812
What do you see?

567
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:23,857
October 4th...

568
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:31,781
Busy day. Writing, cooking,
mess in the kitchen and...

569
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:35,160
Alex and Sara came out of the country.

570
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:36,619
Yes?

571
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:40,832
So we went a car, talking, and
slot of traffic and it's getting dark...

572
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:44,961
We get up there and I can't get
the security system to......... it's

573
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:47,714
just when I touch it goes crazy.

574
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:50,717
Anna fixes it, we go in the house...

575
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,430
Hold a fire.
First fire in the season.

576
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:57,140
And we went to bed.

577
00:50:57,307 --> 00:50:59,726
What happens after you go to bed?

578
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:03,146
I wake up middle of the night.

579
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:09,819
That's...
I don't... I don't...

580
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:21,414
Something went past by window.

581
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:29,089
-Something went past the window?
-A light.

582
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,803
Big, like a light.

583
00:51:35,887 --> 00:51:37,180
But...

584
00:51:37,347 --> 00:51:39,766
I don't want to think about that, so...

585
00:51:41,184 --> 00:51:42,852
I go back to sleelp.

586
00:51:59,744 --> 00:52:01,705
Is that someone there?

587
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:02,622
You know...

588
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:05,625
I see you.

589
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:07,168
I'm seeing some...

590
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:08,837
I'm seeing something there...

591
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,755
I don't think I like this.

592
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:13,133
-It's going fine.
-Get out!

593
00:52:13,258 --> 00:52:14,467
It's going fine...

594
00:52:15,218 --> 00:52:17,220
Away!

595
00:52:17,345 --> 00:52:20,306
Get away!
Out! Get out!

596
00:52:20,765 --> 00:52:22,809
Get away!

597
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:27,230
Why me? What have I done?

598
00:52:30,525 --> 00:52:33,611
This is no god. I can't do this.

599
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:35,780
Whitley, tell me what you see.

600
00:52:35,905 --> 00:52:39,159
It's almost as if this figure is...

601
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:45,540
It's covered in something,
and sticking something into my mind.

602
00:52:48,626 --> 00:52:51,629
Images exploding...

603
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:56,968
The wall is blowing up...

604
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:03,808
My boy is dead.

605
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:08,688
Why I have to die, dad?
Why?

606
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:16,613
I'm not hypnotized now?
Am I?

607
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,949
I think you just came out of it.

608
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:28,291
I want to go home now.
I can't do this.

609
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:31,920
I don't need this. Bad dreams.

610
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,759
Whitley?

611
00:53:38,551 --> 00:53:40,303
It was a bad state.

612
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,389
But it's over.

613
00:53:42,555 --> 00:53:44,516
Never be over, not now.

614
00:53:44,683 --> 00:53:47,352
Whatever happened is in the past,
and you're fine.

615
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:49,813
You don't know, you said it.

616
00:53:49,979 --> 00:53:52,482
That's truth, but it's all right.

617
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:55,068
Whitley...

618
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,447
Let him go, let him work this out.

619
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:31,563
Excuse me, I'm lost.

620
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:36,276
Can you help me? Do you know if this bus
goes in the end of the line?

621
00:54:41,406 --> 00:54:44,034
You know...

622
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,371
I can't believe this.

623
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:51,958
It's an ambush.

624
00:54:53,209 --> 00:54:55,420
You, people... you're really.

625
00:54:55,587 --> 00:54:59,549
I'm telling you're really for one big surprise.
One very big surprise.

626
00:55:09,976 --> 00:55:13,396
-You want anything else, Whit?
-No, thank you.

627
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:19,778
-They all looking for you.
-How did you know?

628
00:55:19,944 --> 00:55:21,654
Anne said to look here.

629
00:55:21,821 --> 00:55:23,239
Anne know everything.

630
00:55:23,406 --> 00:55:25,700
Let's go home.

631
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:28,620
They tell you what happened?

632
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:29,996
A little.

633
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:34,584
When the doctor hypnotized me,
I supposed recall prowlers, or something...

634
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:38,338
but in fact I recall something else...
I sure do.

635
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:39,673
What?

636
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,884
Little blue fuckers,
about that big.

637
00:55:43,885 --> 00:55:46,971
We're back! I found him!

638
00:55:47,138 --> 00:55:49,641
-How are you feeling?
-Good.

639
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,938
I'm sorry... that I got so crazy.

640
00:55:55,105 --> 00:55:56,898
Oh, don't worry about it.

641
00:55:57,065 --> 00:55:58,441
-I've been thinking...
-Any calls?

642
00:55:58,608 --> 00:55:59,943
No.

643
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:02,529
Whitley...

644
00:56:04,197 --> 00:56:06,866
There is a group, that meets that...

645
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:08,827
You might want to join?

646
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:09,994
Group?

647
00:56:10,161 --> 00:56:13,540
People who seen the same other things you have.

648
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:15,667
No, I don't think so.

649
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:17,627
Whitley, they are real.

650
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:22,215
I have a dozen patients who have all report
had seen the same being as you saw.

651
00:56:24,342 --> 00:56:26,052
No!

652
00:56:26,636 --> 00:56:28,388
Allright.

653
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:32,559
There is one illness,
temple lobe epilepsy.

654
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:35,562
It might cause that you had hallucinations.

655
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:39,232
Is that we all saw the light.
Do we all to have epilepsy?

656
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:42,861
Then even I heard some strange noises.

657
00:56:43,319 --> 00:56:47,782
There is a test that you can take
to determine what do you have the disease.

658
00:56:47,949 --> 00:56:51,077
Oh, this is going to be just
a little bit unpleasant.

659
00:56:51,619 --> 00:56:53,455
There's sticking... it sticking...

660
00:56:53,621 --> 00:56:56,458
Don't move.
Stay very still now.

661
00:56:56,624 --> 00:56:58,460
Don't talk.

662
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:00,628
How long this is take?

663
00:57:00,795 --> 00:57:02,714
Not long, not long.

664
00:57:02,881 --> 00:57:04,841
About 45 minutes.

665
00:57:05,008 --> 00:57:08,595
Now I would like you to do
some deep breathing exercises for me.

666
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:11,973
OK, breathing deeply through your mouth.

667
00:57:16,978 --> 00:57:18,813
Close your eyes.

668
00:57:20,815 --> 00:57:22,984
Open your eyes.

669
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:29,366
Now, that medication I gave you early
is gonna make you take a little nap.

670
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,391
What is it, Whit?

671
00:58:02,899 --> 00:58:03,775
Good news!

672
00:58:04,234 --> 00:58:05,902
The test came back negative.

673
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:09,531
You do not have temple lobe epilepsy.

674
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:17,831
Hi, dad.

675
00:58:17,997 --> 00:58:21,626
Dad, I waited ........ for you to come home.

676
00:58:22,877 --> 00:58:26,089
Help me go to sleep, daddy?

677
00:58:26,506 --> 00:58:29,843
I'm having a very hard time without you.

678
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:34,431
<i>Without a sound the white camellia fell,</i>

679
00:58:35,724 --> 00:58:39,394
<i>To sound the darkness of the deep stone well.</i>

680
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:42,856
That's a lot of pictures for a few words.

681
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:44,566
Yeah.

682
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:47,569
It's a kind of poem called "Haiku".

683
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:51,114
Dad, I have a very bad problem.

684
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:54,743
-What's up?
-There's a skull staring at me.

685
00:58:54,909 --> 00:58:58,872
With huge eyes.
I can see it in my head.

686
00:59:00,165 --> 00:59:01,541
Do you have a bad dream?

687
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:03,460
No.

688
00:59:07,547 --> 00:59:09,799
I saw little blue doctors, dad.

689
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:12,260
And tall thin ones too.

690
00:59:12,594 --> 00:59:14,012
With big eyes.

691
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:16,723
Were they real, dad?

692
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:19,267
I don't know.

693
00:59:20,518 --> 00:59:22,729
What do you think they are?

694
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:26,316
I don't know. They're kind of scare me.

695
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:28,068
Kind of?

696
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:31,154
Not truly, they're ugly and...

697
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:34,032
that's scary, but...

698
00:59:34,407 --> 00:59:36,785
inside...

699
00:59:37,535 --> 00:59:40,413
they also ..... perfect.

700
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:43,375
Like that poem.

701
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:48,273
Ten... falling asleep.

702
01:00:48,982 --> 01:00:51,484
Deeeply, deeply asleep.

703
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:58,658
Anne, let's go back in time.

704
01:00:59,451 --> 01:01:02,746
Do you remember Christmas?

705
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:05,290
Allright, let's go back further.

706
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:09,753
Go back to the night,
that Alex and Sara came to the house.

707
01:01:10,628 --> 01:01:13,256
Do you remember that night?

708
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:16,217
Well, it wasn't a very peaceful night.

709
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:18,511
Go on.

710
01:01:20,263 --> 01:01:22,182
The house was full.

711
01:01:23,933 --> 01:01:25,602
It was like a party.

712
01:01:26,102 --> 01:01:27,562
A party?

713
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:31,483
I don't think Whitley was there
right much of the time.

714
01:01:31,649 --> 01:01:33,193
What about your son.

715
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:34,611
God!

716
01:01:34,736 --> 01:01:36,988
Oh God, he's screaming.

717
01:01:43,161 --> 01:01:45,622
It's painfull to hear.

718
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:48,083
Oh, it's like something's happening to with it's.

719
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:50,752
Whitley is going, I want to go.

720
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:52,837
I've got to go.

721
01:01:53,004 --> 01:01:56,007
You are not suppose to go.

722
01:01:56,174 --> 01:01:58,593
I've got to go!

723
01:01:59,886 --> 01:02:03,014
You are suppose to stay in bed.

724
01:02:04,432 --> 01:02:08,061
I've got to go, my baby is screaming!

725
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:09,562
Anne, who is talking to you?

726
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:14,609
I've got silly! I'm not suppose to say, I don't know!
I'm not suppose to do this!

727
01:02:15,151 --> 01:02:18,446
Why? What's preventing you?

728
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,865
I'm out of it... I'm out of it, right?
I'm out of it.

729
01:02:21,032 --> 01:02:22,826
Yes, quite suddenly.

730
01:02:22,992 --> 01:02:26,287
I don't know...
there was somebody doing something...

731
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:29,958
There was somebody else...

732
01:02:36,881 --> 01:02:40,093
He calls them "little doctors".

733
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,099
I don't like this.

734
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:49,060
He seems so little.

735
01:02:50,186 --> 01:02:52,647
What should we do?

736
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:57,110
Should he be hypnotized, we send him to Janet?

737
01:02:57,277 --> 01:03:00,113
No, he is too young.

738
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:05,201
I'll go back myself see what this is.

739
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:17,672
Whitley, let's go back now to the night of december 26th,
the day after Christmas.

740
01:03:18,256 --> 01:03:21,176
What do you having for supper?

741
01:03:24,095 --> 01:03:28,433
Goose... and a cranberry souce, sweet potatoes,
Christmas.........

742
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:34,481
Now, go forward to later that night.

743
01:03:34,647 --> 01:03:36,566
Go forward.

744
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:38,526
What happens?

745
01:03:39,527 --> 01:03:41,446
I'm checking up the house.

746
01:03:41,613 --> 01:03:43,573
Why?

747
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:46,868
In case there might be somebody there...

748
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:48,828
...hiding.

749
01:03:49,287 --> 01:03:50,372
Who?

750
01:03:50,372 --> 01:03:52,791
Those things people.

751
01:03:52,957 --> 01:03:56,586
-Did you know about those people then?
-Sure.

752
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:59,130
Did you tell anyone?

753
01:03:59,214 --> 01:04:01,800
Well, I didn't suppose them.

754
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,970
Have a gun.

755
01:04:07,555 --> 01:04:09,849
Why do you have a gun?

756
01:04:10,016 --> 01:04:11,142
I have that...

757
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:14,187
the feeling... that

758
01:04:15,605 --> 01:04:18,233
it might...

759
01:04:20,151 --> 01:04:23,571
...somebody there, hiding.

760
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:25,073
Not us.

761
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:29,119
I'm going to take you further forward
in that night.

762
01:04:29,661 --> 01:04:32,622
You relax, deep sleep.

763
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:35,500
You're going to remain calm.

764
01:04:36,126 --> 01:04:36,835
What happens?

765
01:04:37,002 --> 01:04:40,505
I am you. You are me,
and...

766
01:04:41,923 --> 01:04:44,426
we are here.

767
01:04:48,013 --> 01:04:51,558
I am the dreamer, you are the dream.

768
01:05:06,072 --> 01:05:08,867
Is that someone there?

769
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:49,657
Wow!

770
01:05:53,536 --> 01:05:55,580
Wait a minute.

771
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:59,250
What are you doing?

772
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,462
Please, let me go.

773
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:07,467
Awful, terrible.

774
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:10,845
-What's terrible?
-What they did to me.

775
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:10,238
I had enough, I give up.
I want to go home.

776
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:20,874
In spite of...

777
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,260
Are you old?

778
01:07:35,221 --> 01:07:38,141
Please, let me go.

779
01:07:40,685 --> 01:07:42,771
I can't wake up.

780
01:07:43,355 --> 01:07:45,565
Here I am! I'm naked.

781
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:49,986
I'm naked!
I'm talking to you like you are real.

782
01:07:50,653 --> 01:07:52,989
Go to hell.

783
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:59,371
Terrible.

784
01:08:07,128 --> 01:08:09,464
Can we talk this over?

785
01:08:10,382 --> 01:08:12,759
It looks like we're going to see
the white Christmas.

786
01:08:19,015 --> 01:08:21,226
You're probing my mind.

787
01:08:37,617 --> 01:08:39,411
I'll kill you.

788
01:08:43,707 --> 01:08:45,959
How dare you.

789
01:08:57,345 --> 01:08:59,222
I'll kill you.

790
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:26,041
You've broken my mind.

791
01:09:54,819 --> 01:09:57,364
I can't get out of this.

792
01:10:05,663 --> 01:10:07,457
Mum.

793
01:10:11,252 --> 01:10:13,463
Mum!

794
01:10:16,466 --> 01:10:19,928
Oh, he wants a...
he wants his mum.

795
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,469
I can't get out of this!

796
01:11:01,636 --> 01:11:03,763
One... waking up.

797
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:06,725
Two... waking up.

798
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:09,269
I'm seeing things in my whole life.

799
01:11:09,644 --> 01:11:11,730
What is it, Whit?

800
01:11:17,152 --> 01:11:19,612
Three... you're awake.

801
01:11:41,676 --> 01:11:44,095
It's been...

802
01:11:44,888 --> 01:11:46,890
Thank you.

803
01:11:47,057 --> 01:11:51,936
Now I know, this thing has been in my life...
my whole life.

804
01:11:52,812 --> 01:11:55,315
I passed it on.

805
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,694
Now it's with my son.

806
01:12:03,656 --> 01:12:06,284
I've seen them before.

807
01:12:07,077 --> 01:12:11,706
-In your childhood ..........
-No, no, no. Like I'm seeing you, like I'm seeing this.

808
01:12:11,873 --> 01:12:15,460
Like I'm seeing everything...
seeing room.

809
01:12:22,217 --> 01:12:24,719
You say, that...

810
01:12:24,886 --> 01:12:26,513
there is a group...

811
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,641
Yes, a special group.

812
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:39,359
I don't want to be crazy.

813
01:12:41,903 --> 01:12:45,281
I'd like to introduce Anne and Whitley.

814
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:48,535
Whitley's had some very vivid experiences.

815
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:49,786
He's a writer...

816
01:12:49,953 --> 01:12:53,331
I'm not sure, I'm comfortable
with the writer beeing here, Janet.

817
01:12:53,498 --> 01:12:56,042
Yeah, the force will kick me off
of this got out.

818
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Do the rest of you feel threatened
by his profession?
Well, it's face that the newspapers laugh of us.
More like an entertainment.

819
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:09,848
Not that kind of writer I'm making up on,
I'm novelist.

820
01:13:10,015 --> 01:13:11,683
So, what you got to write about us?

821
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:12,934
A comic novel?

822
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:14,436
Wait a minute,

823
01:13:14,602 --> 01:13:17,355
Whitley isn't here because he is a writer.

824
01:13:17,522 --> 01:13:19,691
He's here for the same reasons you are.

825
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:22,986
Why don't you tell us something
of what you can remember?

826
01:13:23,153 --> 01:13:25,655
What I remember?

827
01:13:28,074 --> 01:13:32,996
It couldn't be what happened that
what I happened, I don't know, I remember...

828
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,165
monsters.

829
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:39,461
They came into my house.

830
01:13:39,627 --> 01:13:45,884
The short stocky ones, and the covered alls,
with the slim willowy ones with the big eyes.

831
01:13:45,967 --> 01:13:47,510
Beg your pardon?

832
01:13:47,677 --> 01:13:49,179
What?

833
01:13:49,262 --> 01:13:52,015
Who was involve with you?

834
01:13:52,098 --> 01:13:53,016
What do you mean?

835
01:13:53,141 --> 01:13:54,726
Oh come on, let's cut the crap.

836
01:13:54,893 --> 01:13:56,561
Which group ot the aliens abducted you?

837
01:13:56,728 --> 01:14:00,690
Bob, we are not victims,
we are participants.

838
01:14:00,857 --> 01:14:04,861
Well, I don't know' about you folks,
but I am very definitely a victim.

839
01:14:05,028 --> 01:14:08,031
I didn't want what happened to me.
I didn't ask for this.

840
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:10,992
Wait a minute. Give the guy chance.
So come on, Whitley...

841
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:13,286
Which group abducted you?

842
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:16,623
-Did you see a ship?
-Ship?

843
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,878
This happened in the house,
in the country.

844
01:14:22,045 --> 01:14:26,383
Oh, do you have circle or a triangle scar
anywhere in your body?

845
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:28,718
No.

846
01:14:28,885 --> 01:14:32,889
Because a lot of us them have.
You know, I want to get back to this participant thing...

847
01:14:33,056 --> 01:14:37,686
I didn't want what they did to me.
I didn't want a rectal probe ........

848
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:41,731
It's not funny.
That's why I say victim.

849
01:14:41,815 --> 01:14:43,817
Nobody wants it, nobody asked for it.

850
01:14:43,983 --> 01:14:47,278
We have to make this experience work for us.

851
01:14:47,445 --> 01:14:50,615
I don't want we'll live the rest
of our lives in fear.

852
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:52,242
So we get together.

853
01:14:52,409 --> 01:14:55,495
-And we talk about it.
-And laugh.

854
01:14:55,578 --> 01:14:56,996
Sometimes.

855
01:14:57,872 --> 01:15:01,710
Well, we all are space cadets, see.
So what a hack.

856
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:03,837
We have to make the best of it.
You know.

857
01:15:04,004 --> 01:15:07,590
This isn't a joke.
These beings are real.

858
01:15:07,757 --> 01:15:11,302
Even if we don't know what that means.

859
01:15:11,928 --> 01:15:14,556
It may sound like a cliche, but...

860
01:15:14,723 --> 01:15:17,642
these visitors do coming gigantic ships,

861
01:15:17,809 --> 01:15:21,021
and they contact a lot of people.

862
01:15:21,187 --> 01:15:28,028
A, not of course, we say it's a thunderstorms
or a bad dreams, hallucinations, meteors, whatever,

863
01:15:29,195 --> 01:15:31,281
but...
the joke's on us.

864
01:15:31,406 --> 01:15:33,867
We are the ones who are hiding.

865
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:37,620
They came to me one night in 1959.

866
01:15:37,787 --> 01:15:39,789
I was lying in bed, reading the book,

867
01:15:39,956 --> 01:15:45,045
when suddenly a group of little men
in blue uniforms walked in the room.

868
01:15:45,879 --> 01:15:48,381
Short, three-four feet tall.

869
01:15:48,548 --> 01:15:51,968
Very round, their faces were...

870
01:15:52,135 --> 01:15:55,096
Well, I was terrify.

871
01:15:56,097 --> 01:15:59,434
One of them put his hand on my wrist...

872
01:15:59,601 --> 01:16:01,770
-And it was...
-...clammy.

873
01:16:01,936 --> 01:16:04,147
...Like the skin of a frog.

874
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:08,860
And one of them said: don't worry,
it's not you we're interested in.

875
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:13,740
We are interested in...

876
01:16:13,907 --> 01:16:15,784
the girl child you carry.

877
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:18,828
Did they let you keep her?

878
01:16:18,995 --> 01:16:22,374
My daugter is a wonderful woman.

879
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:26,169
And now her daughter is involved to.

880
01:16:26,336 --> 01:16:28,672
How old is she?

881
01:16:28,838 --> 01:16:30,632
My granddoughter is six.

882
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:33,051
Passed it on.

883
01:16:33,218 --> 01:16:37,347
The only thing to do
is to face it.

884
01:16:37,681 --> 01:16:41,601
Because otherwise it's just gonna
tear you like the peaces.

885
01:16:41,768 --> 01:16:44,062
Believe me, I know.

886
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:47,107
At least you two have each other.

887
01:16:47,273 --> 01:16:52,987
My husband did not have the experience,
and he tried to have me committed.

888
01:16:54,364 --> 01:16:57,701
Now at least he doesn't have me
to worry about anymore.

889
01:16:57,867 --> 01:17:00,578
I wasn't as lucky as Laurie.

890
01:17:00,745 --> 01:17:03,998
She still has her daughter and the granddaughter.

891
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:07,127
I was 3 months pregnant.

892
01:17:07,293 --> 01:17:11,756
And my husband and I saw this huge light outside.

893
01:17:13,091 --> 01:17:16,344
We just went to sleep.

894
01:17:16,511 --> 01:17:19,556
That next morning I woke up
and i wasn't pregnant anymore.

895
01:17:19,723 --> 01:17:21,766
Whitley...

896
01:17:21,933 --> 01:17:25,603
Won't you tell us little more
about what happened to you.

897
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:27,897
God, honey I'd like to go home.

898
01:17:28,064 --> 01:17:32,694
So, it's my wife and I, you know, we have a family too,
and we have ought to thing about this.

899
01:17:38,366 --> 01:17:40,410
Thank you.

900
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:43,121
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

901
01:17:45,248 --> 01:17:47,876
-Very much.
-Come back.

902
01:17:52,797 --> 01:17:55,508
I wish you to stay.

903
01:17:55,675 --> 01:17:59,637
I tried hypnosis, I tried this I tried that,
I tried this I tried that...

904
01:18:00,096 --> 01:18:03,683
No, it's not working.
I have to do something for myself.

905
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:07,270
You expect this, you expect anwers so quickly.

906
01:18:07,437 --> 01:18:11,316
We don't even know all the questions yet.

907
01:18:12,734 --> 01:18:15,445
Allright, of course. But...

908
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:20,575
if... if... if I was in my right mind,
I wouldn't know that too.

909
01:18:22,702 --> 01:18:26,706
There is nothing matter with your mind,
be patient.

910
01:18:26,873 --> 01:18:29,376
Take care.

911
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

912
01:18:59,322 --> 01:19:02,033
Look at me.

913
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:05,787
Am I not gorgeous?

914
01:19:05,954 --> 01:19:07,872
What the hell...

915
01:19:16,589 --> 01:19:20,593
You don't like your toys from your
First Communnion.

916
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:23,430
Don't wait up for me, baby.

917
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:27,225
What are you doing?

918
01:19:28,935 --> 01:19:31,062
I shall return.

919
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:34,315
Where you're going?

920
01:19:40,739 --> 01:19:43,283
Going for pack of cigarettes.

921
01:19:55,045 --> 01:19:56,463
You don't smoke.

922
01:23:58,246 --> 01:24:01,041
I must be awake.

923
01:24:01,374 --> 01:24:04,085
Is that what you mean?

924
01:24:04,753 --> 01:24:07,547
I must be awake.

925
01:25:07,857 --> 01:25:09,943
I'm gonna do a trick.
Look at this.

926
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:13,321
Empty, right?
Show him.

927
01:25:20,662 --> 01:25:22,706
I should cast a spell.

928
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:26,209
This has to cook them.

929
01:25:26,376 --> 01:25:30,588
Want to say a few things.
First I'd like to say seasons greetings,

930
01:25:30,755 --> 01:25:35,885
then I'd like to say, keep your hands
on the table, at all the times.

931
01:25:37,721 --> 01:25:39,472
Boo!

932
01:25:43,852 --> 01:25:47,355
I want to go home. Please, let me go.

933
01:25:47,522 --> 01:25:49,274
Are you old?

934
01:25:49,441 --> 01:25:51,234
You've broken my mind.

935
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:52,736
I'll kill you.

936
01:25:52,902 --> 01:25:55,113
Can we talk this over?

937
01:25:57,198 --> 01:25:58,908
I can't wake up!

938
01:25:59,075 --> 01:26:02,620
I am the dreamer. You are the dream.

939
01:26:04,456 --> 01:26:05,206
Look.

940
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:10,837
The only thing that really matters here
is one I'm about to show you.

941
01:26:31,608 --> 01:26:33,651
That's not it.

942
01:26:34,361 --> 01:26:36,363
I didn't come all this way...

943
01:26:36,529 --> 01:26:39,824
for you to tell me
that that's what it is.

944
01:26:39,991 --> 01:26:43,828
Is there something on ......?
Because I don't believe that one.

945
01:26:47,165 --> 01:26:48,333
It's like a...

946
01:26:48,833 --> 01:26:51,086
box. A Chinese box.

947
01:26:52,712 --> 01:26:56,216
You open it, and there is another one inside,
and there is another one inside...

948
01:26:56,383 --> 01:26:58,718
You know, I can let me
see you who are you.

949
01:26:58,885 --> 01:27:02,013
It is a Chinese box.

950
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:06,017
And you're not...
you're not to be alive to see.

951
01:27:06,643 --> 01:27:10,271
OK? So, just get that clear.

952
01:27:11,606 --> 01:27:14,776
You're not going to let to see you.

953
01:27:15,068 --> 01:27:17,612
That's a good idea.

954
01:27:49,352 --> 01:27:52,397
One... two, three, shoot!

955
01:27:55,316 --> 01:27:56,818
Anybody home?

956
01:27:56,985 --> 01:27:59,195
Dad! Dad!

957
01:28:01,656 --> 01:28:04,159
What are you doing up?
Why aren't you in school?

958
01:28:04,325 --> 01:28:07,495
Mom and me to............ wait for you.

959
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:13,043
We are playing war.

960
01:28:13,209 --> 01:28:16,963
I'm beating a pence afford.
That for sure.

961
01:28:17,547 --> 01:28:20,425
-I saw them.
-You did?

962
01:28:20,508 --> 01:28:21,509
Something happened.

963
01:28:21,676 --> 01:28:22,635
-How are you?
-Good.

964
01:28:22,677 --> 01:28:24,888
Dad, come here, I wanna
show you something....

965
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

966
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,528
What happened?

967
01:28:40,695 --> 01:28:41,946
They danced.

968
01:28:42,113 --> 01:28:44,616
What kind of dance?

969
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:48,953
The bossa-nova, how do I know?

970
01:28:52,415 --> 01:28:55,919
They let me know that I...

971
01:28:56,419 --> 01:28:57,671
was...

972
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:00,382
chosen...

973
01:29:02,092 --> 01:29:03,301
to something.

974
01:29:03,635 --> 01:29:04,344
And...

975
01:29:06,137 --> 01:29:09,974
they invited me to come with them.

976
01:29:11,768 --> 01:29:14,562
I had the feeling, forever.

977
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,651
Then was morning.

978
01:29:30,203 --> 01:29:33,832
-They asked you to go with them?
-Yeah.

979
01:29:34,582 --> 01:29:37,752
I just came home to get my stuff.

980
01:29:40,046 --> 01:29:43,383
You had that mark that invite in your head.

981
01:29:43,758 --> 01:29:44,884
Thank you for that one.

982
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,657
...w tym okresie to za ma³o dziwne,
by traktowaæ to serio.

983
01:30:09,868 --> 01:30:11,786
For the facts:

984
01:30:11,953 --> 01:30:14,497
if we're talking about what they know about us,

985
01:30:14,664 --> 01:30:19,502
you'd have to... you would have to consider
that they... they could be sitting at home tonight...

986
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:21,838
and watching "The Honeymooners".

987
01:30:22,005 --> 01:30:24,257
Like Ralph and Alice... like us.

988
01:30:24,424 --> 01:30:26,926
That's why they picked on me.

989
01:30:27,093 --> 01:30:29,220
You know, what I think?

990
01:30:29,304 --> 01:30:32,307
I don't think it matters.

991
01:30:33,266 --> 01:30:37,562
Whatever it is,
they know, was pay way of television...

992
01:30:37,729 --> 01:30:40,398
and bulls like that...

993
01:30:42,192 --> 01:30:45,070
If... if we're talking about light years..

994
01:30:45,153 --> 01:30:48,239
tonight they're watching the first episode
"The Father Knows Best"

995
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:51,993
It'll be narcissistic of us to feel alone in the universe.

996
01:30:51,993 --> 01:30:55,121
People used to think that the world
was flat, you know, the center of things.

997
01:30:55,246 --> 01:30:57,999
That excludes the possibility of visitors.

998
01:30:58,166 --> 01:31:02,253
That's really another kind of...
of the same kind thinking.

999
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:08,927
The world is getting so small, that
it would be nice to meet someone new.

1000
01:31:10,804 --> 01:31:13,431
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know...

1001
01:31:14,432 --> 01:31:17,519
I don't know what you saw.

1002
01:31:18,395 --> 01:31:20,980
What is it matter?
It doesn't matter.

1003
01:31:21,147 --> 01:31:23,900
It's just God.

1004
01:31:24,109 --> 01:31:28,530
Who saw something extraordinary?
There are many faces of God.

1005
01:31:29,823 --> 01:31:31,616
Masks of God.

1006
01:31:33,159 --> 01:31:35,620
Our history is a response to their presence.

1007
01:31:35,745 --> 01:31:41,167
They might be what the face of evolution
looks like on the response to...

1008
01:31:42,043 --> 01:31:44,462
a conscious mind.

1009
01:31:45,005 --> 01:31:47,382
You know something?

1010
01:31:50,844 --> 01:31:52,887
You frighten me.

1011
01:31:53,888 --> 01:31:57,475
Because you went so far away...

1012
01:32:01,229 --> 01:32:04,315
but at your back...

1013
01:32:04,482 --> 01:32:06,985
you're different.

1014
01:32:08,445 --> 01:32:11,281
I think they gave you something.

1015
01:32:13,742 --> 01:32:16,703
I do. I think they gave you a gift.

1016
01:32:20,123 --> 01:32:21,499
You'd better use it.

1017
01:32:24,586 --> 01:32:26,254
You're sleeping?

1018
01:32:27,714 --> 01:32:31,384
Like this:
I gotta know, I gotta know what is...

1019
01:32:31,718 --> 01:32:34,471
Look at this, Anne , wake up, wake up.

1020
01:32:34,637 --> 01:32:36,097
I got this great.

1021
01:32:36,264 --> 01:32:39,559
It's the first chapter, look, look, awake.

1022
01:32:43,146 --> 01:32:44,397
OK, OK...

1023
01:32:45,607 --> 01:32:50,570
I got this great first chapter.
I got such a night, yeah. About of the start.

1024
01:33:22,227 --> 01:33:24,521
Andy... Andy wake up.

1025
01:33:24,688 --> 01:33:26,940
Come on, come on.
Wake up.

1026
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:30,026
I show you something.

1027
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:37,158
Whitley...

1028
01:33:56,636 --> 01:33:58,430
What's going on?

1029
01:34:00,974 --> 01:34:04,728
-What are we doing?
-It was a huge light.

1030
01:34:07,605 --> 01:34:09,315
What are we doing?

1031
01:34:10,483 --> 01:34:12,152
Mom, what are we doing?

1032
01:34:12,569 --> 01:34:13,987
Nothing.

1033
01:34:14,154 --> 01:34:16,948
Let's go back to bed.

1034
01:34:17,991 --> 01:34:20,744
You think it could have been a plane?
Helicopter?

1035
01:34:24,914 --> 01:34:28,043
-So beautiful. You see the moon?
-Let's go back.

1036
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:37,761
Andy, wait, wait... come here.
Come here...

1037
01:35:04,996 --> 01:35:09,209
Maybe we do have an afterlife,
but not quite in the way...

1038
01:35:09,334 --> 01:35:11,378
tradition suggests.

1039
01:35:11,586 --> 01:35:16,716
Maybe you and I are larvae,
and the "visitors"...

1040
01:35:16,716 --> 01:35:20,178
are human beings in the mature form.

1041
01:35:20,178 --> 01:35:24,641
Certainly, we are consuming our planet's resources...

1042
01:35:31,564 --> 01:35:37,278
But in state, I'm sure in transform...

1043
01:35:37,445 --> 01:35:40,073
...astronomers of India believed...

1044
01:35:45,370 --> 01:35:48,415
What do I call a book...

1045
01:35:49,457 --> 01:35:51,501
...about you?

1046
01:36:26,327 --> 01:36:31,583
<i>The Striebers continue to live in</i>
<i>their cabin in upstate New York.</i>

1047
01:36:31,708 --> 01:36:38,340
<i>By October 1989, nineteen other people</i>
<i>had encountered similar unknown beings there.</i>

1048
