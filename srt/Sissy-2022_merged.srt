1
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:48,439
Hi, there!

2
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:50,485
Oh, God. Not again.

3
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:53,705
We are best friends
because, well,

4
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:57,144
first of all we have
so much in common

5
00:00:57,187 --> 00:00:59,407
and you tell
a lot of better reasons.

6
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,802
Well, 'cause
whenever I first met you,

7
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:06,936
which was so long ago
I can't even remember...

8
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:11,027
When we were like first born.
In our mums' bellies!

9
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:15,075
Our mums knew each other and
went through our mums' bellies.

10
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,294
We were like, "Hi, there!"

11
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:21,168
Yeah, so we were talking
and literally

12
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:25,737
I just can't, like,
picture myself without her.

13
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:28,479
So, yeah, you're my best friend.

14
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:40,578
I am loved.

15
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:43,015
I am special.

16
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:45,148
I am enough.

17
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:48,064
I am doing my best.

18
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,415
We all are.

19
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:57,856
And now we take our ropes
and we lay them around us,

20
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,902
just like so.

21
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:03,688
And, you know, when we form
a circle around ourselves

22
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:05,125
we're actually reminded

23
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:08,737
that we carry with us
an invisible boundary.

24
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,652
It goes with us wherever we go

25
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:13,698
and no-one enters this boundary
but us.

26
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:17,311
It's our very own safe space.

27
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:21,141
And now we breathe in short,
rapid breaths,

28
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:23,708
just like we practised
in my last video,

29
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:26,450
and for those new friends
joining us today

30
00:02:26,494 --> 00:02:28,278
that's Episode 253,

31
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:30,933
Making Friends
With Hyperventilation.

32
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:51,388
Mm.

33
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:53,608
And before we seal off
our practice

34
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:57,177
with 20 minutes
of blissful meditation

35
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,352
I just want to take a moment

36
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:01,659
to tell you all about Elon Mask,

37
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:05,707
the amazing, deep-cleansing,
paraben-free rubber mask.

38
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,319
It's highly absorbent,
perfect for combination skin

39
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:12,496
and I mean, look,
I use them all the time,

40
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,585
especially before meditating.

41
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,371
I just find that having
a fresh face,

42
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:19,851
it really helps me
to connect with my body,

43
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:24,465
my inner essence, my core self.

44
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:27,076
And to celebrate

45
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:32,037
SincerelyCecilia reaching
200,000 followers...

46
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,604

47
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:37,129
It's still so amazing.
Thank you.

48
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:40,394

I am loved @SincerelyCecilia.

55
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:14,689
I needed this today.

56
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:18,954
The world needs more people
like you.

57
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:22,566
SincerelyCecilia, I think
you just saved my life.

58
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:13,704
Good evening, Jane. Things have
certainly escalated in the...

59
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:16,403
mobilising troops
as international tensions rise.

60
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:19,101
Sea levels are rising
at the fastest rate in three...

61
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:25,368
I just... I thought
I was his pick, you know?

62
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:27,762
Like, I've given
everything to him

63
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:29,894
and he just goes with Shazza.
Like...

64
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:33,202
Prayer, sparkle, angel face.

65
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:37,772
I... I don't get it.
Like I'm such a good person.

66
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:40,905
I don't want to cry.
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,386
I just feel stupid, you know?

68
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:53,701
Welcome to Pharm Animals!

69
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:55,964
Udderly cheap, udderly friendly.

70
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:58,749
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

71
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,108
Hi.

72
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:12,415
So my mum gets these, like,
really big headaches

73
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,418
and, um, I don't know
if you have it here?

74
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:17,507
Like, I talked to the cashier

75
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:19,553
and they said that like
they don't know

76
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:21,598
so like they, um...

77
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:25,428
Basically I just... I need to
help her with that headache.

78
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:27,648
Do you sell it
over the counter here?

79
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:32,000
That is... That is available,
but you'd need a prescription.

80
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:33,567
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

81
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,743
In the States they just
kind of... They sell it.

82
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:36,874
So I need to go to a GP?

83
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,746
You're gonna have to
get to a GP.

84
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:44,882
- What the actual fuck!
- I just...

85
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:50,714
Yeah, I'm just pregnant.
It's fine.

86
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,631
Here.

87
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,372
- Ah, we don't take cash.
- Excuse me.

88
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,375
Sissy?

89
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,378
- Oh, my God, it's you!
- Oh, my God.

90
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,120
What's it been,
like 10, 15 years?

91
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:13,607
It's... It's me, Emma.
Emma Quinn?

92
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,784
- You remember me, right?
- Yeah.

93
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:18,612
I was thinking about you
the other day,

94
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:21,484
and now here you are,
right in front of me.

95
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,355
Isn't the universe just crazy?

96
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,053
- So crazy.
- Oh, yeah, I know.

97
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,489
It's a little embarrassing,
right?

98
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:29,753
But I'm just crazy about Fran,
my fiancée.

99
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:31,755
You should come to
our engagement party.

100
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,888
- We're doing karaoke.
- Oh, I don't...

101
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:36,499
Nuh, you have to come.
You have to come.

102
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:40,068
Give me your handle.
I'll send you the deets.

103
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:48,293
Um, it's...@SincerelyCecilia.

104
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:56,824
Holy shit.
200,000 followers?

105
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:59,827
What... Are you...
Are you an influencer?

106
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:02,699
Influencer?

107
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:05,397
Sissy, you're doing really well!

108
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:08,226
Ah... Cecilia.

109
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,750
What?

110
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:11,316
Ah, it's just, um...

111
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,405
It's actually just...

112
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:15,233
Cecilia now.

113
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:17,845
Oh! Yeah! Cool! I love that.

114
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:20,456
Cecilia. Très profesh.

115
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:26,810
It was so good to see you,
Sissy.

116
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:29,509
Sorry. Sorry. Cecilia.

117
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:35,906
Ohhh.

118
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:10,680
Let's make a pact.

119
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:12,682
No matter what happens,

120
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:15,032
we end up in the nursing home
together.

121
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:18,732
You're the only person
I want to poop my pants with.

122
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:22,910
Now let's do this.

123
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,471
Sorry!

124
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:05,039
- I'm walking here!
- Sorry!

125
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:07,432
- Fuck!
- I'm sorry.

00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:25,065
Babe, just give me some space.

178
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,501
OK, OK.

179
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:28,111
I'm Fran, by the way.

180
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:30,635
- Oh, ah, yeah. Cecilia.
- I know.

181
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,987
Emma literally hasn't stopped
talking about you all day.

182
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,250
Oh, shit! What did she say?

183
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:38,774
She's just...
She's really happy you're here.

184
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,994
Well, I'm sorry
if it's weird that I came.

185
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:43,779
I know that we haven't seen
each other in a long time

186
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,563
and like we've never met and...

187
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,261
Oh, babe.

188
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:49,524
I'm gonna call you an Uber
and get you some water, OK?

189
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,831
- No. No!
- Wait, close your eyes.

190
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,007
- What?
- Just do it. Trust me.

191
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,531
- It'll be worth it, I promise.
- OK.

192
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:59,534
Don't open until I say so, OK?

193
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:02,885
I think that real friends
are like stars.

194
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:04,582
You can't always see them

195
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:07,063
but you know that
they're always there.

196
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:09,587
- OK, like now or...
- No, just a sec, just a sec.

197
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:12,329
OK. Open.

198
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:22,557
Don't laugh at me.

199
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,908
Remember when we were little,
when you used to always say,

200
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:29,172
"You know, not everything's
about you."

201
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:31,783
Hey, I'm so sorry.

202
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:35,265
Oh, nah. It's no worries.

203
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,789
Remember Fantagate?

204
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,140
That was way worse.

205
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:45,972
- Oh, my God.
- Gross.

206
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,105
- Hey.
- Mmm?

207
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:51,542
What are you doing this weekend?

208
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,154
Ah, I don't know.

209
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:57,940
You should come
to my hens' weekend.

210
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,986
Oh, nah, you don't have to...

211
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:02,597
Yes, yes, you have to come.

212
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,905
Why don't we just get a coffee
when you're back...

213
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,819
- yeah?
- Sissy. Sissy.

214
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:09,517
- What?
- Look at moieee.

215
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,259
- What?
- Look at moieee.

216
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:14,478
- Listen.
- Emma.

217
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:15,958
Sissy!

218
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,482
I mean Cecilia. Sorry.

219
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:20,223
Oh, my God.

220
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,138
Hey, so I, um...

221
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:26,099
I drove past
this like nursing home today

222
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:28,362
and there were
these like old bats

223
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:31,713
having like the best
fucking time

224
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:36,544
and I remembered our pact.

225
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:40,026
And then I ran into you.

226
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:44,769
Like... Like what are
the fucking odds?

227
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:46,771
Right? Right?

228
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:50,471
So like let's just like...
Let's cut the bullshit.

229
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:52,342
You're coming to my hens'.

230
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,779
You're coming to my hens'
and I'm gonna make you

231
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,433
'cause I'm gonna send
the address.

232
00:15:56,477 --> 00:16:00,002
I'm gonna send the address.
It's gonna take me a second.

233
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:03,179
Be there or die.

234
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:05,181
Dead face emoji.

235
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,986
Alex?!

236
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,916
Oh, my God, Alex,

237
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,093
these are so expensive!
Thank you!

238
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:34,401
Um, hey, do you mind
if we change the address?

239
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:41,799

Hi, guys.
Welcome to my channel.

250
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,605
My name's Sissy and this
is my best friend, Emma,

251
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:50,172
and today's her 13th birthday.

252
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:52,783
Oh, my God,
is this a time capsule?

253
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:55,525
Your favourite nail polish.

254
00:18:55,569 --> 00:19:01,618
And a poster of the hottest
man on the earth - Jakey.

255
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:03,664
Who do you want to be
when you grow up?

256
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:06,623
Tell all the fans at home.
They're dying to know.

257
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:11,019
I don't know.
I don't really want to grow up.

258
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:12,760
I don't want anything to change.

259
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:14,805
I want to stay
like this forever.

260
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:17,634
Boring!

261
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,116
I'm sorry.

262
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:24,902
Let's make a pact.

263
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:27,209
No matter what happens,

264
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:30,212
we end up in the nursing home
together, OK?

265
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:33,563
You're the only person
I wanna poop my pants with.

266
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:14,648
I am not a sissy.

267
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:18,217
I am not a sissy.

268
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,480
I am not a sissy.

269
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:23,700
- I am not a sissy.
- Hey.

270
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:28,270
I'm not a sissy.
I'm not a sissy.

271
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:30,011
I'm not a sissy.

272
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- I'm not a sissy.
- Who are you?
I'm not a sissy.
It's not my fault.

273
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:50,727
Oh!

274
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:53,513
Ahh! Shit!

275
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:04,219
I am loved.

276
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,700
I am special.

277
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:08,571
I am enough.

278
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:12,140
I am trying my best.

279
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:14,055
We all are.

280
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:19,103
- Hey!
- Oh, Cecilia!

281
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:21,236
Do you know how to drive stick?

282
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,804
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can.

283
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:26,850
- Of course.
- Keys.

284
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:28,765
Thank you.

285
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,767
- Right.
- Hurry up, Franny!

286
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:32,508
OK, well, if y'all helped me

287
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:34,945
I would have been in the car
five minutes ago.

288
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:37,097
I'm so sorry for being disabled
and not be able to help you.

289
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:39,123
It's such a hard life for you,
isn't it?

290
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,735
- Hey.
- Hey.

291
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:44,999
I'm really glad you came.

292
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,414
Shhh!

293
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,286
Ooh!

294
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:01,292
- Shut the fuck up.
- What?

295
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:04,339
Shut up!

296
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,862
What, what? What -

297
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:08,430
Oh, Alex just sent me
a photo of where we're staying

298
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:12,042
and it's like,
"This is your vacation home."

299
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:13,827
Like, what is her life?

300
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,829
Um, Alex?

301
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,221
Yeah, ah, Alex Kutis.

302
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:19,441
Didn't y'all go to school
together?

303
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,536
Come on, Sissy,
don't be a sissy.

304
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,278
Sissy, the sissy.

305
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:32,541
Sissy, the sissy.

306
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Sissy, the sissy.
- I'm not a sissy.
Sissy, the sissy.
Sissy, the sissy.
- Sissy...
- Watch out!

307
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,684
What the fuck was that?

308
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:46,207
I think it was a roo!

309
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,470
Get out the car.
Get out front. Is anyone hurt?

310
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:49,863
I'm a vegan, guys.

311
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:52,082
- This is really not cool.
- Oh, shit, my neck!

312
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:53,910
Come on.

313
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,397
Oh.

314
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,138
This is so fucked.

315
00:24:04,181 --> 00:24:06,532
Will someone please
finish it off?

316
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:10,318
I... I don't suppose anyone
has a gun?

317
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:14,540
We're in Australia, babe.
We drive back over shit here.

318
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,152
Where's the keys?

319
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:21,329
Cecilia?

320
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:29,468
Cecilia. Keys.

321
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:32,949
- But it... it's still alive.
- Barely.

322
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:36,126
Look, it's the humane thing
to do.

323
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,911
My dad is selling
this car next week.

324
00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:40,261
- He's gonna be so pissed!
- It's a shitty Tarago.

325
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:42,524
Couldn't be worth
more than $200 anyway.

326
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:21,215
Oh, my God, this is gorgeous!

327
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:23,696
Wow!

328
00:25:25,262 --> 00:25:27,221
My God, it's so beautiful!

329
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:29,484
I wanna fuck this house.

330
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,835
- Bitch, we're here!
- We're here!

331
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:37,405
Alex, can I please have
intercourse with your house?

332
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:38,972
Yeah, if you don't mind.

333
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:41,235
I wanna come inside.
Oh!

334
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:44,630
Yeah, let's do it! OK.

335
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:47,633
This is so beautiful!

336
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:58,861
Let us in!

337
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:20,404
Hey.

338
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:22,276
Um...

339
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:26,470
Pussy!

340
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:40,571
G... G'day.

341
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:43,792
Sissy?

342
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:50,103
Um... Ah, yeah, you know,
it's actually Cecilia now.

343
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:51,757
Yeah, how crazy is this?

344
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,848
I ran into Cecilia yesterday,
right, at the pharmacy,

345
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:57,806
and then I invited...
Alex.

346
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,460
Alex!

347
00:27:59,503 --> 00:28:01,941
Um, Alex? Ow, my hand.

348
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:05,727
Um, she, um...

349
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,468
What just happened?

350
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:09,992
Awkward!

351
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,995
Oh, this is cute.

352
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:17,217
Shut up!

353
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,914
I'm so sorry.
I didn't, honestly...

354
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,655
- She's crazy.
- I know.

355
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,309
I fucking hate her.

356
00:28:22,352 --> 00:28:24,591
I didn't think she'd actually
come. I forgot I invited her.

357
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:26,530
She's a psycho.

358
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:38,891
Oh, fuck! That was
great. They're gonna love it.

359
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:40,719
She has the weirdest crap, hey?

360
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,982
She? Why do you have to
gender her?

361
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:48,988
Sorry, Cecilia.

362
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:51,164
Emma neglected to inform me
that you'd be joining us.

363
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:52,295
Oh.

364
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:53,775
Unfortunately all
the beds are taken

365
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:55,777
but you are welcome to sleep
on the couch.

366
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:58,606
Oh, thanks.
The couch is totally fine.

367
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:00,390
Sorry, I didn't
know about the beds.

368
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:02,436
That's OK.

369
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:06,005
Ooh, bitches!
Paradise Lost!

370
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,182
Are you guys serious?

371
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:12,359
This is the most...
THE most commercial,

372
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:13,882
white, privileged bullshit -

373
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:15,797
- Oh, shut it, Saint Frances!
- It's an example

374
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:18,191
of how much we've slipped
as a society.

375
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:19,801
It is.

376
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:22,978
- Oh, my God, she's so dumb.
- Her bikini.

377
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:24,937
OK, I'm just going
to the toilet.

378
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,026
Do we just like objectify women?

379
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:29,506
- Are they real, though?
- They're not real!

380
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,247
- Is it, um...
- None of these are real.

381
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:34,120
- OK, but I guarantee you...
- Is it round that way or...?

382
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:36,600
Half of these girls are
sleeping with each other.

383
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:40,343
Sorry, I'm busting,
so I'm just gonna...

384
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:46,306
Don't judge him.
He's a loser.

385
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:49,657
He's disgusting!

386
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,895
You know this is all scripted.

387
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,834
Have you guys never done that
before?

388
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,841
I am loved.

389
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:02,365
I am special.

390
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:05,804
I am enough.

391
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:08,894
I am trying my best.

392
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:11,113
We all are.

393
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:16,466
Yeah, we all are.

394
00:30:24,692 --> 00:30:26,955
I'm sure
it's like a two-point deal.

395
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,392
Like one boob job, the other
boob job, you know what I mean?

396
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:31,133
You still gonna do that for me?

397
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:33,570
- No. Stop it.
- I'm joking. It was a joke.

398
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:35,746
- "I'm joking."
- No, it's not.

399
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,445
- You can't make up this shit.
- It's trash.

400
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:40,621
Ah, excuse me?

401
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:42,318
Thank you. Thank you.

402
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:44,731
And the gaslighting this season
is like the crème de la crme.

403
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:46,757
Hey, so I just wanted to make
a little speech.

404
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:49,369
- It's artistry.
- Of course it is.

405
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:51,458
It's so good.
It's just like...

406
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:53,460
Emma?

407
00:30:53,503 --> 00:30:56,419
- It's not!
- It's beautifully scripted.

408
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:59,292
- It's the best writing ever!
- Hey, Emma!

409
00:30:59,335 --> 00:31:02,773
- Sorry.
- Hey.

410
00:31:02,817 --> 00:31:07,126
Sorry.
Um, I, ah, I got you this.

411
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:09,955
Well, I... I mean it's, ah...

412
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:13,872
I guess it's an early
wedding present.

413
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:16,744
Something old.

414
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:19,703
Is this our time capsule?

415
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:23,185
Oh, my God,
I totally forgot about this!

416
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:27,059
Oh, Cecilia!
This is amazing.

417
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:28,558
This is like that
Britney Spears movie

418
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:29,864
where they bury their dreams
in a box

419
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,933
before they get their period
but by prom

420
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:33,650
they hate each other
and one of them gets knocked up

421
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:35,870
and wants to paddle in the
Pacific 'cause her life's over.

422
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,505
- J.G.
- J.G.!

423
00:31:38,548 --> 00:31:40,028
He's too hot.

424
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:41,963
Do you know how many times
I made out with this poster?

425
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:43,553
Hold on, this is the best part.

426
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:45,618
How many times did that
make out with your vagina lips?

427
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:48,732
Yeah, that's yours! Fuck it.

428
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:51,213
Hey, guys.

429
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:54,260
Ah, but what about Paradise?

430
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:58,220
I promise it'll be so worth it.
Alright?

431
00:31:58,264 --> 00:32:01,267
Just... fuckin' wait.

432
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,138
Babe!

433
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:07,751
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

434
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:13,061
I totally forgot about this!

435
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:17,370
- I know!
- Look at us! We're so little.

436
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:22,549
Literally I just can't, like,
picture myself without her.

437
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:24,638
So, yeah, you're my best -

438
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:28,685
Dinner's ready.

439
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:31,950
But Remy's gonna bitch slap
Chloe!

440
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,299
But I'm gonna bitch slap you

441
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:35,301
if you don't get your ass
to that table

442
00:32:35,344 --> 00:32:37,738
because I am really hungry.

443
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:39,261
Yes, Mum.

444
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:42,003
I'm gonna get changed.
I smell like rotten cum.

445
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,570
Not mine!

446
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:47,574
- Your CEO's maybe?
- Don't you fucking dare!

447
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:49,619
Alex!

448
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:52,361
Sissy, don't be a sissy.

449
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:54,624
Oh, my God, Alex,
these are so expensive!

450
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:56,452
Happy birthday, biatch!

451
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:58,411
And to Alex, my maid of honour,

452
00:32:58,454 --> 00:33:00,761
thank you for hosting us all
this weekend. I love you.

453
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:02,415
I am loved.

454
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:04,654
It's the least I could do after
missing your engagement party.

455
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:06,810
I am special.
I am enough.

456
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:08,769
And your beautiful
lives together.

457
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:12,729
I am doing
my best. We all are.

458
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:14,688
I'll get down on one knee.

459
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:20,737
I am confident.
I am special. I am enough.

460
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:22,870
His married CEO!

461
00:33:22,913 --> 00:33:24,828
I'm doing my best.

462
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:30,660
What about you, Cecilia?
Are you dating anybody?

463
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,145
Oh, nah.

464
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:39,974
Nah, I don't really have time,
you know?

465
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,194
I'm just like busy and focused

466
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:45,153
but guess that sounds kinda...
kinda stupid, right?

467
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:49,636
Not at all. Not when you're as
successful as you are.

468
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,726
- Really? What do you do?
- Oh, I'm... I'm a -

469
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:55,033
- She's an influencer.
- An influencer?

470
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,948
- Well, um...
- That's your fulltime job?

471
00:33:57,992 --> 00:33:59,515
Pretty much.

472
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:02,040
She has like 200,000 followers.

473
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,520
Fuck off.
That's more than Alex.

474
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:06,131
Oh, are you an influencer too?

475
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:08,350
Ew. No.

476
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:11,701
Fuck off!
You know Chris Hemsworth?

477
00:34:11,745 --> 00:34:15,140
No. No.
I wouldn't say I know him,

478
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:17,272
I just promoted his app
for a little bit.

479
00:34:17,316 --> 00:34:22,799
- And you got paid to do that?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

480
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:26,412
Fucking hell. I'm the least
cool person at this table.

481
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:28,979
I've been telling you
that for years, babe.

482
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:31,939
So what's your thing?
Are you like a model, or...

483
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:35,464
Nuh. No, definitely not.

484
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:39,555
You're like a therapist, right?

485
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,428
I'm more like a mental health
advocate.

486
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:43,820
You know, basically

487
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:46,127
I just try to
help people with their issues.

488
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,650
Like what?

489
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:52,046
You know, like confidence,
self-worth, self-acceptance,

490
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,830
anxiety, depression, OCD.

491
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:57,138
That's really cool. Do you need
a degree for that, or...

492
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:59,532
Oh, I'm...
I'm not a psychologist.

493
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:03,318
I'm just, ah... well,
just a fellow human

494
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:04,711
trying to, you know,

495
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:06,515
share some things that I've
learned along the way.

496
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:08,367
How much money do you make?

497
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,108
- Tracey!
- What?

498
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:13,459
- That's none of our business.
- Yes, it is.

499
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:14,721
If she's a public figure

500
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:16,766
and she's profiting
from people's pain

501
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,161
then that should be
public knowledge.

502
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:22,032
I'm not profiting from -

503
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,860
Actually, Alex has a point.

504
00:35:23,904 --> 00:35:27,168
You're getting paid, maybe not
by your followers directly

505
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:29,538
but you're influencing them to
buy whatever you're advertising

506
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:31,346
and you're not qualified.

507
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:34,349
Which, legally, is very murky.

508
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:37,222
I mean, what if someone
killed themselves

509
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:38,614
because you didn't
check your DMs?

510
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:40,138
- Jamie!
- I'm serious.

511
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:43,184
Cecilia could
get into a lot of trouble.

512
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:46,361
No, I've always been
very clear with my followers,

513
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:49,234
you know, from the beginning,
that I'm not a professional.

514
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:52,846
Sometimes people want to feel
seen, you know?

515
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:54,891
They wanna feel like, um...

516
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:59,200
somebody sees their value
and they want to feel loved.

517
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:03,291
So, um... I just try to remind
people that they're special.

518
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:04,735
It's kind of like
what you do, babe.

519
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:07,121
- Oh.
- Oh, what do you do?

520
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,645
She's a psychologist.

521
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:12,257
Oh, like an actual psychologist.

522
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,606
- No. No, no, no, no.
- Wow.

523
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:15,042
I'm not a psychologist.

524
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:18,524
I... have a few years left
on my doctorate

525
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,134
- so I'm studying to be.
- Whoa.

526
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,397
- That's really cool.
- Thanks.

527
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:25,270
Fran helps real people
with real problems

528
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:28,186
- whereas in Sissy's case...
- Cecilia...

529
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,425
you could argue that those
people aren't even like real.

530
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:34,496
Alex, of course Cecilia's
followers are real people.

531
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,846
- Are they, though?
- Alex.

532
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,980
No, no, no, I mean,
Alex is right.

533
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:44,202
What I'm doing is nothing
compared to what Fran's doing.

534
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:45,638
That's incredible.

535
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:48,336
Well, to Fran and Cecilia.

536
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,166
The world needs more
people like you. Cheers.

537
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,212
Cheers.

538
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:56,910
I just... I'm sorry,

539
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:59,521
but I can't help but find it
all a little bit ironic.

540
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:01,480
- Ironic?
- Yeah, that of all people

541
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:03,786
Sissy is preaching
about mental health.

542
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,093
Cecilia.

543
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:08,182
- What are you, rebranding?
- Alex.

544
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,880
Guys!

545
00:37:27,984 --> 00:37:29,769
OK.

546
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:36,645
I am enough.

547
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:38,908
I... I am...

548
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:43,696
trying my best. Fuck.

549
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,233
The world needs more
people like you.

550
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,672
I hate myself. Please help.
I'm #trying.

551
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:06,675
- Knock, knock!
- Hi.

552
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,331
Hey. Do you mind if I join you?

553
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:14,640
Whoo!

554
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:18,339
Come on in.

555
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:20,950
The water's great!

556
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:29,132
Are you OK?

557
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:37,532
- Yes. Fuck.
- Oh, don't cry.

558
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:39,621
Please don't cry.

559
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:41,406
Fuck.

560
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:45,061
- Cecilia.
- I'm sorry.

561
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:49,544
I just feel like I...

562
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,723
I've just tried so hard to...

563
00:38:54,767 --> 00:39:00,773
to like... to heal
and to move on and...

564
00:39:00,816 --> 00:39:07,083
Whatever. I'm always gonna be
Sissy, the sissy to her.

565
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:11,044
Well, you know what?
Fuck Alex.

566
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:13,394
Seriously. Seriously!

567
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:15,353
- Fuck Alex?
- Yeah.

568
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,442
Do you know how much
fucked-up shit

569
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:19,052
she's done over the years?

570
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:23,099
But like this is what I think,
OK?

571
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:27,930
All of that stuff that happened
between the two of you

572
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:30,019
was a lifetime ago.

573
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,807
It was an accident.
You were a child.

574
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,157
Like you didn't know
what you were doing.

575
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:43,468
You are a really good person,
Cecilia.

576
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:44,904
Mm.

577
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:47,950
And I'm really glad you came.

578
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:51,345
So I would like for you
to stop punishing yourself

579
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,261
and just have some fun with me,
OK?

580
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:58,961
Yeah, righto, OK.

581
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:02,661
- Do you think it's expired?
- Oh my God.

582
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:04,793
Come on.

583
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:06,447
Righto.

584
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:12,453
- Ohhh.
- Ahhh!

585
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:14,760
Ohhh. Ooh, still good.

586
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:17,545
You know, you're exactly
how you said you'd turn out.

587
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:19,634
Oh, God, really?

588
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:21,897
What did I say?

589
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:42,004
God!

590
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

591
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:04,897
Bad dream?

592
00:41:08,074 --> 00:41:12,034
I didn't mean to scare you.
I just came to get some water.

593
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:16,735
Do you mind if I sit?

594
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:21,304
Go ahead, yep.

595
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:31,793
I can't sleep either.

596
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:46,068
I feel really bad about before.
I'm sorry.

597
00:41:46,112 --> 00:41:49,681
- Oh, look, that's OK.
- Truce?

598
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:55,425
Um...

599
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:59,473
Yeah. Yeah.

600
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,257
Yeah. Truce.

601
00:42:05,784 --> 00:42:09,744
You have the softest hands.

602
00:42:09,788 --> 00:42:11,790
Thanks.

603
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:14,662
Do you moisturise?

604
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:19,798
Yeah. Um, I use this...
this...

605
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:23,323
stuff. Um.. Do...
Do you want...

606
00:42:23,366 --> 00:42:25,107
Maybe...

607
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,199
Maybe you can help me with this.

608
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:18,770
Oh!

609
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,172
Thanks, Trace.

610
00:43:30,216 --> 00:43:32,305
Look, I'm just trying to change

611
00:43:32,348 --> 00:43:34,220
the ionic composition of the air

612
00:43:34,263 --> 00:43:38,790
so we can all reduce our stress
levels after last night's vibe.

613
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:42,054
Speaking of.
Where is Sissy?

614
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:44,796
Her name is Su-sil-ee-ah.

615
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:48,713
Guys. Not today, please?
Please? Please?

616
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:51,585
This saviour complex you've
got going is so boring, Em.

617
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:55,328
- Saviour complex?
- The chick's a total killjoy.

618
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:58,940
Weren't you the one who was
gushing about how cool she was?

619
00:43:58,984 --> 00:44:01,987
I mean, you've literally
never mentioned her

620
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,771
and she's invited to our hens'.

621
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:05,033
Babe!

622
00:44:05,077 --> 00:44:06,315
I don't have a problem with it.

623
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:08,080
It's just a little weird,
don't you think?

624
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:09,821
Actually, Fran,
it's textbook Emma.

625
00:44:09,864 --> 00:44:11,866
I couldn't stand her
when we were kids

626
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,694
'cause she clung to you
like a fucking koala.

627
00:44:13,738 --> 00:44:17,611
But you were too chickenshit
to tell her, so I had to.

628
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,613
And we both know how that ended.

629
00:44:22,137 --> 00:44:23,704
- How?
- Fuck off!

630
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:25,184
Yep. Deadset.

631
00:44:25,227 --> 00:44:27,099
- Are you serious?
- Hell, no, that was her?

632
00:44:27,142 --> 00:44:30,058
She's not your best friend.
I'm her best friend.

633
00:44:30,102 --> 00:44:34,323
Really? Well, you're not even
invited to her birthday party.

634
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:35,716
Alex!

635
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,109
What birthday party?

636
00:44:37,152 --> 00:44:39,981
Well, it's just...
I didn't think you would come.

637
00:44:40,025 --> 00:44:41,200
All the girls are there

638
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:43,028
and you don't really
get along with them.

639
00:44:43,071 --> 00:44:45,683
So you didn't invite me
to your birthday party?

640
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:48,511
- I knew it! I knew it!
- Why did you invite her?

641
00:44:48,555 --> 00:44:49,774
She's a psycho!

642
00:44:49,817 --> 00:44:51,384
Oh, my God!

643
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:54,953
Alex, it's not like you're a
victim. You were bullying her.

644
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,433
Fuck you.

645
00:44:57,477 --> 00:45:00,175
OK, OK, OK, let's just chill,
team, yeah? Just chill?

646
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:02,308
No, if she's gonna defend
that psycho over me,

647
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:04,092
then fuck her.

648
00:45:04,136 --> 00:45:09,141
Alex, we were 12 years
old. It is time to get over it.

649
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:10,577
You're not the one

650
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,033
who has to look in the mirror
every morning

651
00:45:12,057 --> 00:45:14,755
- and be reminded of her.
- Sissy's cancelled!

652
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:16,409
I knew there was
something off about her.

653
00:45:16,452 --> 00:45:18,759
All that self-help stuff
that she spouts?

654
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:20,824
I mean, this is exactly
what's wrong with social media.

655
00:45:20,848 --> 00:45:22,458
It's a breeding ground
for con artists.

656
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:24,243
Like Belle Gibson.

657
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:26,027
Exactly!
Sissy's cancelled!

658
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:27,507
Jamie, stop.

659
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,770
Can't argue with the clicks,
bitch!

660
00:45:30,902 --> 00:45:32,512
Baby, where are you going?

661
00:45:32,555 --> 00:45:34,775
I'm cold.
I'm going back to the bridge.

662
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:36,081
Yeah, me too.

663
00:45:36,124 --> 00:45:39,171
OK, well, can you just
give me a second?

664
00:45:39,214 --> 00:45:41,826
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

665
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:44,959
- I should probably...
- That's OK. Go.

666
00:45:45,003 --> 00:45:47,092
We need to crack that brie ASAP!

667
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,180
I love you.

668
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:49,529
You're lactose intolerant.

669
00:45:49,572 --> 00:45:50,791
No, I'm not!

670
00:45:50,835 --> 00:45:52,401
Your farts were
so rank last night,

671
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:53,925
I literally couldn't breathe.

672
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:56,362
- You're homophobic.
- No, dude, she's right.

673
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:57,755
It's like on another level,

674
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:59,626
and I think you should really
see a doctor.

675
00:45:59,669 --> 00:46:02,803
I don't need to see a
doctor, OK? I want my cheese.

676
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:04,563
Just leave me alone!
You guys are bullying me.

677
00:46:04,587 --> 00:46:06,807
Stop bullying me!

678
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:10,115
Well, you're not even
invited to her birthday party.

679
00:46:10,158 --> 00:46:13,422
Come on, Sissy,
don't be a sissy.

680
00:46:13,466 --> 00:46:16,382
Sissy, the sissy.

681
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:19,124
Sissy, the sissy.

682
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:22,867
Sissy, the sissy.
Sissy, the sissy.

683
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,826
Sissy, the sissy
Sissy, the sissy.

684
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,698
Sissy, the sissy.
Sissy, the sissy.

685
00:46:28,742 --> 00:46:31,571
Sissy, the sissy.
Sissy, the sissy.

686
00:46:31,614 --> 00:46:34,008
Sissy, the sissy.
Sissy, the...

687
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:35,923
Sissy!

688
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:38,273
I know you're there.

689
00:46:44,584 --> 00:46:46,368
Hey!

690
00:47:00,556 --> 00:47:02,732
Ooh! It's cold.

691
00:47:18,574 --> 00:47:21,273
Why are you here?

692
00:47:21,316 --> 00:47:23,971
Um, Emma left me a map.

693
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:29,150
No, why are you here
at Emma's hens'?

694
00:47:33,285 --> 00:47:36,462
I get that you didn't
expect me to be here

695
00:47:36,505 --> 00:47:38,725
so you're probably feeling
really triggered.

696
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:43,295
And I'm sorry for that.
Like I really am.

697
00:47:46,124 --> 00:47:48,387
I hate knowing that my presence

698
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:49,910
is resurfacing old trauma
for you

699
00:47:49,954 --> 00:47:51,477
but wouldn't it be better

700
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,306
- if we just put this -
- Stop it! Ugh. Stop it, OK?

701
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:56,308
- What?
- No-one's around.

702
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:58,242
- So you can just drop the act.
- It's not an act.

703
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,399
I'm just trying to connect
with you.

704
00:48:00,442 --> 00:48:02,836
You can't
connect with anyone, Sissy.

705
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,969
You're a psychopath.

706
00:48:06,709 --> 00:48:09,277
Um...

707
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:11,932
I'm not a psychopath.

708
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:14,630
- Say that to my face.
- I'm not.

709
00:48:16,328 --> 00:48:19,679
Or better yet your followers.

710
00:48:19,722 --> 00:48:22,856
W... What, is that my phone?
Did you...

711
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,250
Did you take my phone?

712
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:28,427
Go on.

713
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:31,604
Tell them what you did to me.
Go on.

714
00:48:31,647 --> 00:48:33,519
Tell them.

715
00:48:37,653 --> 00:48:40,918
Fine.

716
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:45,052
- Alex...
- Hey, friends!

717
00:48:45,096 --> 00:48:49,056
I have something to tell you
about your beloved guru.

718
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,364
Cecilia is not as sincere
as you think she is.

719
00:48:52,407 --> 00:48:54,453
How do I know this?

720
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:56,977
Well, see this scar?

721
00:48:57,021 --> 00:49:00,807
Once upon a time,
she lost her fucking mind

722
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:02,330
and she tried to murder me.

723
00:49:02,374 --> 00:49:03,897
OK, that's enough.

724
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:27,529
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

725
00:49:30,706 --> 00:49:32,578
I'm not a sissy!

726
00:50:02,347 --> 00:50:04,262
It's not my fault.

727
00:50:04,305 --> 00:50:05,698
It's not my fault.

728
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:07,439
- Help!
- It's not my fault.

729
00:50:10,224 --> 00:50:13,010
- Help!
- It's not my fault.

730
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:15,012
It's not my fault.

731
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:17,275
Help! Help!

732
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:19,973
Help!

733
00:51:29,347 --> 00:51:31,175
Fuck! Fuck!

734
00:51:31,218 --> 00:51:33,090
Alex!

735
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:42,246
Oh, wow.
Look at these beautiful trees.

736
00:52:42,289 --> 00:52:45,379
And can you hear that?

737
00:52:45,423 --> 00:52:47,207
Silence.

738
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:50,341
It's so rare, especially
these days, and you know what?

739
00:52:50,384 --> 00:52:53,126
Now would be a great time
to meditate

740
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,955
but first I just wanted
to remind us all

741
00:52:55,998 --> 00:52:58,914
about the power of kindness.

742
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:01,613
I found this little
uprooted plant

743
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:03,919
and I thought
why not repropagate it?

744
00:53:03,963 --> 00:53:05,356
I mean, it's the least I can do

745
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:07,967
to offset the erosion
I'm causing by hiking today.

746
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:10,012
Pay it forward.

747
00:53:10,056 --> 00:53:13,233
And, you know,
simple acts of kindness

748
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:16,323
are actually known to activate
the area of the brain

749
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:18,586
that is linked to improved mood.

750
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:21,328
So keep that in mind.

751
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:23,417
And, hey, don't worry
if you don't have a shovel.

752
00:53:23,461 --> 00:53:25,419
I mean,
that's what our hands are for.

753
00:53:25,463 --> 00:53:27,769
Plus, if we get a little dirt
under our nails,

754
00:53:27,813 --> 00:53:30,772
maybe we'll get
a bonus boost of B12.

755
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:34,646
Alright, everyone.
I love you.

756
00:53:34,689 --> 00:53:36,865
Sincerely, Cecilia.

757
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:42,044
Fuck!

758
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:51,271
♪ We're hittin' rock bottom
with some top models. ♪

759
00:54:08,984 --> 00:54:11,117
Wow.

760
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,162
So beautiful.

761
00:54:25,523 --> 00:54:28,003
Hello?

762
00:54:29,178 --> 00:54:31,920
Don't fuck with me, Trace.

763
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:34,619
My cock's out

764
00:54:34,662 --> 00:54:39,101
and I'm not afraid to use it!

765
00:54:40,538 --> 00:54:43,889
Hey! Jamie.

766
00:54:43,932 --> 00:54:46,457
Were you watching me pee?

767
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,023
No.

768
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:51,418
Gross.

769
00:54:51,462 --> 00:54:53,638
Nah, I just couldn't find
you guys.

770
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,209
- What happened to you?
- Hmm?

771
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:05,650
Oh, ah... I tripped
back there. I stacked it.

772
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:08,000
I went flying.
You should have seen it.

773
00:55:08,043 --> 00:55:11,525
- OK.
- Yeah.

774
00:55:11,569 --> 00:55:14,093
I'm really high right now.

775
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:21,013
Right, should we go?
Let's go. Let's just...

776
00:55:21,056 --> 00:55:23,145
Should we just head that way,
or...

777
00:55:23,189 --> 00:55:25,800
- Oh!
- Argh!

778
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,544
Fuckin' piss!

779
00:55:32,503 --> 00:55:34,679
Fuck. Sorry.

780
00:55:34,722 --> 00:55:36,942
- Here you go.
- You're pretty.

781
00:55:36,985 --> 00:55:40,206
- You're pretty.
- Shut up.

782
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:42,904
Shall we go?

783
00:55:47,474 --> 00:55:51,565
- What the fuck?
- Oh!

784
00:55:51,609 --> 00:55:56,222
Oh, my God! Is that Alex?

785
00:55:59,921 --> 00:56:04,491
Hey, Jamie!
Jamie, come back!

786
00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:06,972
Jamie! Jamie! Hold on!

787
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:09,714
Just... If you just wait
one second!

788
00:56:10,845 --> 00:56:13,021
Just wait a second! Jamie!

789
00:56:13,065 --> 00:56:16,460
You have picked this card
today to help you remember

790
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:19,027
the importance
of spending time in nature

791
00:56:19,071 --> 00:56:22,770
and connecting with Mother
Nature's healing energies.

792
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:30,430
Ha. I'll see you guys
back at the house, yeah?

793
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:31,910
What? You don't have to leave.

794
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:34,739
Oh, no, no,
I really need some me time.

795
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:37,611
OK, well, can you check
on Jamie, please?

796
00:56:37,655 --> 00:56:39,570
Yes, Mum!

797
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:52,147
Look, the thing that I love
most about you

798
00:56:52,191 --> 00:56:54,802
is that you always see
the good in people.

799
00:56:56,543 --> 00:57:01,983
But it's also
one of your biggest flaws.

800
00:57:04,812 --> 00:57:07,119
Which is why...

801
00:57:07,162 --> 00:57:11,166
you always end up
feeling this way.

802
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:14,126
You just...

803
00:57:14,169 --> 00:57:16,998
You just need to relax.

804
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:32,492
I'm sorry. I can't.
I just...

805
00:57:32,536 --> 00:57:34,973
I should probably go apologise.

806
00:57:38,933 --> 00:57:41,370
Cool.

807
00:57:41,414 --> 00:57:42,981
Great.

808
00:57:43,024 --> 00:57:46,375
Jamie!

809
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:48,334
Jamie!

810
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:59,345
Hey.

811
00:57:59,388 --> 00:58:00,955
Jamie!

812
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:02,696
Wait! Wait!

813
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,351
- Wait.
- Just let me explain!

814
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:07,005
Stay the fuck away from me!

815
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:10,095
It was an accident!

816
00:58:10,138 --> 00:58:13,359
Look, I'm not gonna hurt you,
I promise!

817
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:16,275
Alex had it out for me
for years, alright.

818
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:19,278
And she attacked me and
I didn't have any other choice.

819
00:58:19,321 --> 00:58:20,888
I had to defend myself.

820
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:24,457
If it was self-defence, then
why hide it? Why not tell us?

821
00:58:27,678 --> 00:58:30,724
I mean, I'm cancelled, aren't I?

822
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:34,815
Aren't I cancelled?

823
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:38,515
So why would any of you
believe me, even if I told you?

824
00:58:39,907 --> 00:58:41,518
Just...

825
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:45,957
Please, Jamie.

826
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,959
Please help me.

827
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:51,658
I feel really scared.

828
00:58:51,702 --> 00:58:55,619
Um, it's OK, OK? It's OK.
I'm here, OK?

829
00:58:55,662 --> 00:58:57,664
I've got you. You're safe.

830
00:58:57,708 --> 00:59:00,101
- I see you.
- Jamie!

831
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:01,799
Hey!

832
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:03,888
Trace-

833
00:59:07,674 --> 00:59:10,285
Jamie!

834
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:17,597
Jamie! Jamie!

835
00:59:19,512 --> 00:59:23,777
Oh! Oh! Ugh!

836
00:59:23,821 --> 00:59:26,998
Bitch, Paradise Lost is on soon
and I'm not waiting for you!

837
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:29,827
- Jamie!
- Alex!

838
00:59:31,132 --> 00:59:32,699
Hey, this is Alex.

839
00:59:32,743 --> 00:59:35,093
Just text a message.
Don't leave me a voicemail

840
00:59:35,136 --> 00:59:37,791
because I'm never gonna
listen to it, OK? Bye!

841
01:00:17,526 --> 01:00:20,355
I'm not a sissy.
I'm not a sissy.

842
01:00:29,538 --> 01:00:31,105
All hail, queen.

843
01:00:31,149 --> 01:00:33,673
SincerelyCecilia,
love your vibe, babe.

844
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:35,762
DM us for a collab.

845
01:01:08,186 --> 01:01:09,709
You know more guys
are coming in here

846
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,450
and they're gonna
throw their dicks at you.

847
01:01:11,493 --> 01:01:13,602
They better. They better fully
throw their dicks at me,

848
01:01:13,626 --> 01:01:14,845
otherwise I'm actually done.

849
01:01:14,888 --> 01:01:16,150
I'm gonna walk out of the house.

850
01:01:16,194 --> 01:01:18,065
I can't believe
he didn't pick me.

851
01:01:18,109 --> 01:01:20,589
- His loss, babe.
- Yes. Absolutely.

852
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:23,723
- In your face. That's it.
- Fuck, yeah, babe!

853
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:25,594
You got a snack,
I got a snack...

854
01:01:27,248 --> 01:01:29,773
I mean, I him one time -

855
01:01:29,816 --> 01:01:32,689
- Wait, you him?
- No, it was before this even -

856
01:02:17,864 --> 01:02:19,518
Help.

857
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:22,826
- Holy shit, are you OK?
- Help me, please.

858
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:29,136
OK, the magnesium
will soothe your body

859
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:31,095
and this should help
soothe your face.

860
01:02:31,138 --> 01:02:33,290
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you're sponsored by Elon Mask.

861
01:02:33,314 --> 01:02:35,012
Like, that's amazing.

862
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,496
Oh, are you...

863
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:43,237
Are you crying?

864
01:02:44,891 --> 01:02:49,069
It's OK. Um... I can't
believe she did this to you.

865
01:02:49,113 --> 01:02:50,157
When the others get back

866
01:02:50,201 --> 01:02:52,290
we'll just hash it all out,
yeah?

867
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:54,422
Maybe Alex just needed
to get back at you

868
01:02:54,466 --> 01:02:56,511
to feel better or something.

869
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:00,864
Get back at me for what?

870
01:03:02,648 --> 01:03:04,171
Ah, I don't know. Um...

871
01:03:04,215 --> 01:03:05,782
That wasn't my fault.

872
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:07,479
Yeah, I'm not saying it was.

873
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,613
So why are you looking at me
like that then?

874
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:17,358
- Stop staring at me!
- Sorry.

875
01:03:19,578 --> 01:03:21,754
Sorry.

876
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,974
- Hey, um...
- It's OK.

877
01:03:24,017 --> 01:03:26,846
Just having
a really weird day.

878
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:30,545
Um... I'm just going to...

879
01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:32,112
going to get my phone.

880
01:03:32,156 --> 01:03:34,767
Wait, wait, wait,
hold on, hold on.

881
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,204
Please can you... Sissy.

882
01:03:37,248 --> 01:03:40,512
Ah, Cecilia.
Um... You're hurting me.

883
01:03:40,555 --> 01:03:43,123
- I'm not who she says I am...
- You're really...

884
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:45,256
- OK?
- OK. Just... you're hurting me.

885
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:47,171
- Why don't you believe me?
- Please let me go.

886
01:03:47,214 --> 01:03:49,826
Please let go.

887
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,962
- I'm a good person, OK?
- OK.

888
01:03:57,181 --> 01:03:59,052
- OK.
- OK, look.

889
01:03:59,096 --> 01:04:02,142
Trace, hey, I'm sorry, OK?
I just feel like -

890
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:04,797
Cecilia! Just...

891
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,364
Sorry.

892
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:08,409
That's OK.

893
01:04:08,453 --> 01:04:10,020
- I didn't mean -
- It's OK.

894
01:04:10,063 --> 01:04:11,804
- I'm sorry.
- Let's just, um...

895
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,154
- I really didn't mean it.
- Let's just step outside.

896
01:04:14,198 --> 01:04:15,416
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

897
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,288
- Yeah, yeah.
- Let's get some fresh air.

898
01:04:17,331 --> 01:04:18,637
- And...
- OK, I...

899
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,813
Let's just talk.
Let's just talk outside.

900
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,902
- Alright.
- We'll figure this out, yeah?

901
01:04:22,946 --> 01:04:24,512
- Yeah.
- OK?

902
01:04:30,692 --> 01:04:32,912
Sissy!

903
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:34,696
Sissy!

904
01:05:48,466 --> 01:05:54,080
Time to destination,
four hours and twenty minutes.

905
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:05,352
Hey! Hey!

906
01:06:05,396 --> 01:06:07,311
Stop.

907
01:06:09,487 --> 01:06:11,184
Oh, my God.

908
01:06:11,228 --> 01:06:14,100
Cecilia, thank you so much
for finding me.

909
01:06:19,584 --> 01:06:24,023
Dude, I thought that
I was gonna die out here.

910
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:26,286
No-one's answering their phones.

911
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:28,158
Why is no-one answering?

912
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:35,121
Whoa! Hold on a sec.

913
01:06:35,165 --> 01:06:36,862
I can't get this seatbelt
to work.

914
01:06:36,905 --> 01:06:38,995
In four kilometres, turn right.

915
01:06:39,038 --> 01:06:41,998
Hey, I think the house is
back that way, you know?

916
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:43,216
Where's Emma?

917
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:46,872
- What, she's not at the house?
- Mm-mm.

918
01:06:46,915 --> 01:06:48,656
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

919
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,355
- Isn't that your job?
- Excuse me?

920
01:06:51,398 --> 01:06:53,052
Well, if you love her so much

921
01:06:53,096 --> 01:06:55,098
then why don't you know
where she is?

922
01:06:57,752 --> 01:06:59,667
Hey, are you OK?

923
01:07:02,757 --> 01:07:04,368
Wait, Cecilia, calm down.

924
01:07:04,411 --> 01:07:08,981
Don't fucking tell me
to calm down, alright?

925
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:12,376
Calm down?
After the fucking day I've had?

926
01:07:12,419 --> 01:07:15,248
OK, I think you should
pull over and let me drive.

927
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:16,878
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

928
01:07:16,902 --> 01:07:19,035
No, I... I don't
but if you could just slow down

929
01:07:19,078 --> 01:07:22,777
because my seatbelt -
I can't get my seatbelt on.

930
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:28,522
OK, but can you just slow down?

931
01:07:28,566 --> 01:07:30,959
Cecilia, what's happening?
Where are we going?

932
01:07:31,003 --> 01:07:34,441
Everything's fucked, OK?
That's what's happening.

933
01:07:36,443 --> 01:07:38,097
Cecilia, stop the car.

934
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:40,099
It was supposed to be
me and Emma,

935
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:41,970
like, that was supposed
to be us.

936
01:07:42,014 --> 01:07:44,451
That was our pact.

937
01:07:44,495 --> 01:07:45,800
Stop the car.

938
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:47,715
And we were gonna
make our kids fall in love.

939
01:07:47,759 --> 01:07:50,109
I don't know what's going on
but could you just slow down -

940
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:52,329
And we were gonna like move
into the same nursing home

941
01:07:52,372 --> 01:07:53,915
when we were too old to pretend
that we cared

942
01:07:53,939 --> 01:07:55,245
about anyone else
but each other.

943
01:07:55,288 --> 01:07:56,420
Cecilia, what's going on?

944
01:07:56,463 --> 01:07:58,117
Slow down. I'm here for you.
We can...

945
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:01,642
It was gonna be really cute
and like...

946
01:08:01,686 --> 01:08:04,297
- Like we promised each other.
- Cecilia.

947
01:08:04,341 --> 01:08:07,257
I just need you to slow down
and we're gonna solve this -

948
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,999
And we promised each other
that we were gonna do that.

949
01:08:11,043 --> 01:08:12,958
OK.

950
01:08:13,001 --> 01:08:14,394
Just... I really...

951
01:08:14,438 --> 01:08:16,396
Stop the car.
I'm gonna drive, OK?

952
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,485
I'm gonna drive.

953
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:22,141
But I guess none of that's
gonna happen now, isn't it?

954
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:23,640
- None of that's gonna happen.
- Cecilia, slow down.

955
01:08:23,664 --> 01:08:25,362
'Cause you're gonna
fuck off to America

956
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:27,233
and I'm never gonna
see her again.

957
01:08:27,277 --> 01:08:31,150
- How the fuck is that fair?
- Stop the car!

958
01:08:31,194 --> 01:08:33,239
I mean, why do you get
that kind of life

959
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:35,198
and I'm still so fucking lonely

960
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:37,156
and you don't even know
where she is right now!

961
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,000
- Fiancée of the fucking year!
- Stop the car!

962
01:08:39,027 --> 01:08:40,899
STOP!

963
01:08:48,559 --> 01:08:52,476
In three kilometres, turn right.

964
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:30,487
Why'd you do that, Fran?

965
01:10:31,923 --> 01:10:37,320
Hey! Hey! Hey, it's OK.

966
01:10:39,452 --> 01:10:42,020
It's OK, it's OK.

967
01:10:45,502 --> 01:10:47,330
It's the...

968
01:10:47,373 --> 01:10:49,723
Huh? Huh?

969
01:10:49,767 --> 01:10:51,682
It's the humane thing to do.

970
01:11:02,475 --> 01:11:05,435
It's the humane thing to do.

971
01:11:05,478 --> 01:11:07,828
What?

972
01:11:07,872 --> 01:11:10,309
It's the humane thing to do.

973
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:12,050
What?

974
01:11:12,093 --> 01:11:16,272
It's the humane thing to do.

975
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:19,492
It's the humane thing to do.

976
01:11:19,536 --> 01:11:21,277
What?

977
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

978
01:14:12,186 --> 01:14:14,232
Phone!

979
01:14:29,552 --> 01:14:31,510
Senior Constable Martindale.

980
01:14:34,252 --> 01:14:36,384
Is that you, Gaz?

981
01:14:37,777 --> 01:14:39,300
I told you to stop calling here

982
01:14:39,344 --> 01:14:42,478
when you're
fucked off your head. Huh?

983
01:14:42,521 --> 01:14:43,914
Yeah, yeah, boo-hoo.

984
01:14:43,957 --> 01:14:46,351
Just sober up, alright,
ya bloody drunk.

985
01:14:46,394 --> 01:14:47,831
And, mate, I'm not kidding.

986
01:14:47,874 --> 01:14:49,963
I'm this close to kicking
you off the netball team.

987
01:14:50,007 --> 01:14:51,225
Ahem!

988
01:14:57,797 --> 01:15:00,931
What the fuck are you doing
out in the sticks?

989
01:15:06,414 --> 01:15:08,808
Ah, this is
the Police Department.

990
01:15:08,852 --> 01:15:10,984
Is this, ah, an emergency?

991
01:15:11,028 --> 01:15:13,421
We've got your location here,
mate.

992
01:15:15,293 --> 01:15:17,338
Shit.

993
01:15:35,008 --> 01:15:36,749
Emma!

994
01:15:42,494 --> 01:15:44,627
Emma!

995
01:15:50,023 --> 01:15:52,548
Hey, Emma.

996
01:16:32,109 --> 01:16:35,242
Now would be
a great time to meditate

997
01:16:35,286 --> 01:16:37,462
but first I just wanted
to remind us all

998
01:16:37,505 --> 01:16:39,812
about the power of kindness.

999
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,600
Sissy, the sissy!

1000
01:16:44,643 --> 01:16:47,037
Sissy, the sissy!

1001
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,952
Sissy, the sissy!

1002
01:16:48,995 --> 01:16:51,824
Sissy, the sissy!

1003
01:16:51,868 --> 01:16:54,305
Come on, Sissy.

1004
01:16:55,436 --> 01:16:57,917
Don't be a sissy.

1005
01:17:18,242 --> 01:17:20,984
Get it done.

1006
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1007
01:18:08,771 --> 01:18:11,425
Please... Please help me.

1008
01:18:11,469 --> 01:18:15,778
Alexandra Kutis has killed
three of my friends,

1009
01:18:15,821 --> 01:18:17,127
maybe more.

1010
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:21,000
And she's coming for me too.
Please, send help.

1011
01:18:21,044 --> 01:18:22,915
Please. Please.

1012
01:18:43,849 --> 01:18:45,895
Sissy?

1013
01:18:50,856 --> 01:18:53,119
Sissy.

1014
01:18:53,163 --> 01:18:55,208
Sissy.

1015
01:18:55,252 --> 01:18:57,820
Cecilia.

1016
01:18:57,863 --> 01:18:59,909
Cecilia.

1017
01:18:59,952 --> 01:19:02,912
Cecilia.
Cecilia?

1018
01:19:02,955 --> 01:19:05,741
Cecilia!
What happened?

1019
01:19:07,003 --> 01:19:08,918
OK, don't move. Don't.

1020
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:10,876
Don't move.
Don't move. Just stay there.

1021
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,139
- Stay there.
- OK.

1022
01:19:16,839 --> 01:19:18,536
Fuck!

1023
01:19:21,626 --> 01:19:23,454
Alex?

1024
01:19:23,497 --> 01:19:24,716
Babe?

1025
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:29,765
What the fuck!

1026
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:31,679
Towels?

1027
01:20:08,064 --> 01:20:09,979
What the...

1028
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1029
01:20:17,595 --> 01:20:20,859
Oh, my God! Oh!
Oh, my God! Oh, fuck!

1030
01:20:20,903 --> 01:20:22,426
What the fuck?

1031
01:20:22,469 --> 01:20:24,254
What the fuck?

1032
01:20:26,038 --> 01:20:28,606
No! No!

1033
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:32,610
Fuck!

1034
01:20:32,653 --> 01:20:34,612
Fuck! Tracey!

1035
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Oh, shit. Shit.

1036
01:20:59,724 --> 01:21:02,422
Emma, please, I'm really scared.

1037
01:21:05,034 --> 01:21:06,644
She went crazy.

1038
01:21:06,687 --> 01:21:09,690
- She... She tried to kill me.
- Who?

1039
01:21:09,734 --> 01:21:11,605
Alex.

1040
01:21:14,913 --> 01:21:17,873
I'm so sorry.

1041
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:20,963
Fuck, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come here.

1042
01:21:21,006 --> 01:21:23,356
I mean, if I wasn't here,

1043
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,315
none of this would have
happened.

1044
01:21:31,321 --> 01:21:33,062
Fuck.

1045
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,634
Um...

1046
01:21:40,678 --> 01:21:43,028
where's Fran?

1047
01:21:44,203 --> 01:21:46,553
I don't know.

1048
01:21:57,608 --> 01:22:00,480
Cecilia, um...

1049
01:22:00,524 --> 01:22:03,701
I think it might be time
to call the police.

1050
01:22:06,008 --> 01:22:07,792
No, no, no.

1051
01:22:07,835 --> 01:22:10,403
Nuh. Mm-mm.
There's no time.

1052
01:22:10,447 --> 01:22:12,884
There's no time.
We have to go.

1053
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:15,974
Come on.
We have to go.

1054
01:22:16,018 --> 01:22:17,889
Come on.

1055
01:22:22,546 --> 01:22:25,592
Emma, come on. Come on.
Just come with me.

1056
01:22:25,636 --> 01:22:27,116
Come...

1057
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:51,314
It was an accident.

1058
01:22:52,532 --> 01:22:54,621
You were a child.

1059
01:22:54,665 --> 01:22:57,189
You didn't know
what you were doing.

1060
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:03,891
You are a really good person,
Cecilia.

1061
01:23:03,935 --> 01:23:06,894
And I'm really glad you came.

1062
01:23:06,938 --> 01:23:11,725
So I would like for you
to stop punishing yourself

1063
01:23:11,769 --> 01:23:13,205
and just have some fun
with me...

1064
01:23:13,249 --> 01:23:14,990
We are best friends...

1065
01:23:15,033 --> 01:23:16,252
OK?

1066
01:23:16,295 --> 01:23:18,515
Because, well,
first of all

1067
01:23:18,558 --> 01:23:22,301
we are absolutely the same

1068
01:23:22,345 --> 01:23:26,088
and we have so much in common.

1069
01:23:26,131 --> 01:23:27,828
Oh, my gosh.

1070
01:23:28,786 --> 01:23:31,006
We were so young.

1071
01:23:31,049 --> 01:23:33,660
Doesn't it feel like it was
yesterday?

1072
01:23:33,704 --> 01:23:35,967
So crazy.

1073
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,361
But you know,
the more I think about it,

1074
01:23:38,404 --> 01:23:42,104
the more I realise, like,
time is just a construct.

1075
01:23:48,153 --> 01:23:51,852
Ooh, ooh, hold on.
I'm gonna show you something.

1076
01:23:51,896 --> 01:23:55,030
Get ready, bitch.
It's gonna blow your mind.

1077
01:23:57,771 --> 01:24:00,687
Do you love it?

1078
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:03,299
Matching! Sisters!

1079
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:07,346
Pink really is your colour.

1080
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:09,348
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
shut up!

1081
01:24:09,392 --> 01:24:12,177
Deep blue sea, baby!

1082
01:24:14,005 --> 01:24:17,139
♪ My sister,
sister... ♪

1083
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:20,707
What?

1084
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:23,971
Oh! You're fuckin' right.

1085
01:24:24,015 --> 01:24:25,930
Let's get you some nail polish,
babe.

1086
01:24:25,973 --> 01:24:29,194
- Mm!
- One second!

1087
01:24:29,238 --> 01:24:31,762
Just hold on one minute, OK?

1088
01:24:35,505 --> 01:24:37,550
Did you put it in your bag
or something?

1089
01:24:37,594 --> 01:24:41,685
It kinda just grew legs
and walked off!

1090
01:24:41,728 --> 01:24:43,861
Hey, um, give me a second.

1091
01:25:10,888 --> 01:25:13,673
Emma?

1092
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:45,009
Found it.

1093
01:25:50,275 --> 01:25:52,321
Great! Still some left.

1094
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:57,500
Emma, what -

1095
01:26:32,274 --> 01:26:33,884
Where's Fran?

1096
01:26:35,581 --> 01:26:37,496
It... It was an accident.

1097
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,194
I just...

1098
01:26:42,284 --> 01:26:44,460
I really didn't mean
to hurt her.

1099
01:26:44,503 --> 01:26:47,114
Everything just kind of
spiralled out of control.

1100
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:49,204
Please don't hate me!

1101
01:26:49,247 --> 01:26:51,728
No! No!

1102
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:54,513
No!

1103
01:27:00,171 --> 01:27:02,304
No, no.

1104
01:27:03,783 --> 01:27:06,612
- Oh, gosh.
- Hey.

1105
01:27:06,656 --> 01:27:09,398
OK, look.

1106
01:27:09,441 --> 01:27:11,922
I think we can get through this.

1107
01:27:21,105 --> 01:27:23,542
You're a fucking monster.

1108
01:27:23,586 --> 01:27:28,286
You're a fucking, psychotic,
little, fucked-up monster.

1109
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:30,351
You always have been
and you always fucking will be.

1110
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:32,421
I'm a good person.
You said that!

1111
01:27:32,464 --> 01:27:34,727
You fucking said that!

1112
01:27:36,903 --> 01:27:39,384
Shit, Emma.

1113
01:27:39,428 --> 01:27:41,778
What are you doing?

1114
01:27:41,821 --> 01:27:43,997
Emma, no! No!

1115
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,834
You're the fucking monster!

1116
01:27:58,055 --> 01:28:01,188
I mean, did you ever
even really like me?

1117
01:28:03,669 --> 01:28:06,542
Or did you just get some
kind of like sick pleasure

1118
01:28:06,585 --> 01:28:08,979
out of pitying me?

1119
01:28:28,607 --> 01:28:32,176
You just care so much
what people think about you.

1120
01:28:34,047 --> 01:28:35,397
Can't stand the thought

1121
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:40,097
that maybe someone might
think you're weird.

1122
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:43,535
They might know the real you.

1123
01:28:43,579 --> 01:28:46,103
Might find out you
have a heartbeat

1124
01:28:46,146 --> 01:28:48,932
or feelings or a fucking soul.

1125
01:28:51,151 --> 01:28:53,066
I'm real.

1126
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:56,331
And if that makes me a sissy,
then so what?

1127
01:28:56,374 --> 01:28:58,594
Great.

1128
01:28:58,637 --> 01:29:00,726
- I'm proud of that.
- Help. I need help.

1129
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:02,249
My friends are missing.

1130
01:29:02,293 --> 01:29:04,991
My address is...

1131
01:29:05,035 --> 01:29:06,906
Please, I need help.

1132
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:10,736
You know, it's people like you

1133
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:12,235
that make the rest of us
feel like shit.

1134
01:29:12,259 --> 01:29:14,044
Emergency.
Police, fire or ambulance?

1135
01:29:14,087 --> 01:29:15,524
Police.

1136
01:29:15,567 --> 01:29:17,830
- Are you in a safe location?
- No. No, I'm not safe.

1137
01:29:17,874 --> 01:29:19,832
Please help, please help.
Please come.

1138
01:30:37,954 --> 01:30:39,869
Thank you.

1139
01:30:41,697 --> 01:30:44,351
Thank you.

1140
01:30:49,095 --> 01:30:50,662
Em!

1141
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:08,479
Hey!

1142
01:32:10,263 --> 01:32:13,005
Hey.

1143
01:32:18,228 --> 01:32:22,319
Are... Are you...
Are you alright, love?

1144
01:32:22,362 --> 01:32:24,582
Mm-hm.

1145
01:32:24,626 --> 01:32:28,281
Alright, is there anyone else
in the house?

1146
01:32:28,325 --> 01:32:30,501
Alright, you just...
You stay there, alright?

1147
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:32,198
You... You...
You're safe there.

1148
01:32:32,242 --> 01:32:34,549
I'm gonna...

1149
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:38,857
I'm gonna secure the house, OK?

1150
01:32:38,901 --> 01:32:40,772
And I'll be back.

1151
01:32:44,384 --> 01:32:46,169
Yep.

1152
01:32:49,694 --> 01:32:52,784
Oh, my God.

1153
01:32:52,828 --> 01:32:54,830
Oh, my God.

1154
01:33:01,619 --> 01:33:04,404
Fuck me.

1155
01:33:04,448 --> 01:33:08,147
You got this.
Yeah, you're a weapon.

1156
01:33:32,084 --> 01:33:33,782
And this is Sissy,

1157
01:33:33,825 --> 01:33:36,915
my best friend
in the whole wide world.

1158
01:33:36,959 --> 01:33:39,657
This is you
when you were a baby!

1159
01:34:11,036 --> 01:34:14,126
Hi, guys, welcome to my channel.

1160
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:16,259
My name's Sissy and this
is my best friend, Emma,

1161
01:34:16,302 --> 01:34:17,956
and today is her 13th birthday.

1162
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,699
You're officially old enough
to be a child bride.

1163
01:34:21,743 --> 01:34:24,659
Speak for yourself. I'm gonna
be so cool when I'm older.

1164
01:34:24,702 --> 01:34:27,139
- Oh, really?
- Yep.

1165
01:34:27,183 --> 01:34:30,752
I'm gonna have pink hair
and drive an old yellow car.

1166
01:34:30,795 --> 01:34:31,970
Your turn.

1167
01:34:32,014 --> 01:34:33,668
Who do you want to be
when you grow up?

1168
01:34:33,711 --> 01:34:37,280
Tell all the fans at home.
They're dying to know.

1169
01:34:37,323 --> 01:34:38,977
I don't know.

1170
01:34:41,023 --> 01:34:43,416
I don't really want to grow up.

1171
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:46,506
I don't want anything to change.

1172
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:48,378
I want to stay like this
forever.

1173
01:34:48,421 --> 01:34:50,989
Boring!

1174
01:35:09,181 --> 01:35:11,880
I am loved.

1175
01:35:11,923 --> 01:35:14,099
I am special.

1176
01:35:14,143 --> 01:35:16,754
I am enough.

1177
01:35:16,798 --> 01:35:19,235
I am doing my best.

1178
01:35:19,278 --> 01:35:21,541
We all are.

1179
01:35:22,804 --> 01:35:27,112
And now we take our rope

1180
01:35:27,156 --> 01:35:32,074
and we lay it around us like so.

1181
01:35:32,117 --> 01:35:37,296
And as always when we form
a circle around ourselves

1182
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:41,648
we are reminded that we carry
with us an invisible boundary.

1183
01:35:41,692 --> 01:35:44,651
No-one enters that boundary
but us.

1184
01:35:44,695 --> 01:35:47,176
It's our very own safe space

1185
01:35:47,219 --> 01:35:51,354
and we never, ever
have to leave it.

1186
01:35:55,097 --> 01:35:56,794
When I was the lone survivor

1187
01:35:56,838 --> 01:35:59,362
of the Alexandra Kutis
massacre...

1188
01:36:01,581 --> 01:36:04,628
my boundary was all I had.

1189
01:36:04,671 --> 01:36:08,763
When I hid in that bathroom
as Alex murdered my friends...

1190
01:36:11,026 --> 01:36:13,506
honestly, I...

1191
01:36:15,378 --> 01:36:18,511
I wanted to give up.

1192
01:36:18,555 --> 01:36:21,036
I wanted it to be over.

1193
01:36:26,911 --> 01:36:29,566
But then I thought of all of you

1194
01:36:29,609 --> 01:36:32,874
and I realised
I had to be strong.

1195
01:36:34,876 --> 01:36:38,488
I had to practise
what I preach, you know?

1196
01:36:38,531 --> 01:36:41,491
So I did The Steps.

1197
01:36:41,534 --> 01:36:46,583
I came back into my body,
regained control of my mind

1198
01:36:46,626 --> 01:36:49,238
and refused to be a victim.

1199
01:36:52,197 --> 01:36:53,764
And now you can too.

1200
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:55,635
Order my new book,

1201
01:36:55,679 --> 01:37:00,858
Don't Survive, Thrive: Simple
Steps to Living Your Best Life.

1202
01:37:00,902 --> 01:37:04,427
And, even better,

1203
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:07,343
all of my friends,
all ten million of you,

1204
01:37:07,386 --> 01:37:10,563
will receive one of my new,
bespoke,

1205
01:37:10,607 --> 01:37:14,002
non-allergenic therapy ropes.

1206
01:37:14,045 --> 01:37:15,264
