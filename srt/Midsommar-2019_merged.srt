they burned up in a fire

1049

technically, an orphan.

Because I do,
I really, really do.

Yet my difference is, I never
got the chance to feel lost,

1053
01:12:23,245 --> 01:12:27,148
because I had a family here.

1054

Where everyone embraced me.
And swept me up.

1055
01:12:32,854 --> 01:12:34,890

a community that doesn't

1056

and what's not theirs.
