1
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,601
Oh, fuck.

2
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,809
Holy shit.

3
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,353
Fuck no.

4
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,712
Hello?

5
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,084
Hey, man.

6
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:34,286
Hey, you okay?
You look troubled.

7
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:39,291
Oh, yeah, sorry.
It's just, um, you should come see this.

8
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:40,859
Uh...

9
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,294
What's going on, buddy?

10
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:47,032
Remember I told you
I was getting those calls,

11
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,701
and I had that DVD sent to me?

12
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,270
I know.

13
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:53,438
It's happening again?

14
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,240
Yeah.

15
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,643
- Oh, my god. -I thought
that was over, but...

16
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:00,078
I just had a package
outside, and...

17
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,413
- Just now?
- Yeah.

18
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,482
That was in there.

19
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:15,127
This person sent you
a stuffed baby wolf?

20
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,596
I mean, I guess.

21
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,298
It doesn't make any sense.

22
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,901
There was also
this DVD that was in it.

23
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,774
Dave, this is your...

24
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,076
That's your home.

25
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,010
Dave.

26
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,745
Yeah, I know, I know.

27
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,947
This is serious.

28
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,849
Whoever shot this,
they shot it last night.

29
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,121
And that's me last night.

30
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,057
We have to call the police.

31
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,192
- You need to call the police.
This is serious. -No, no.

32
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:50,095
No, I already called
the police the last time,

33
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,097
and nothing happened, okay?

34
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,198
They said they...

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,666
Well, that's unconscionable.

36
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,401
- That's unconscionable. -No,
they even sent a patrol car.

37
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,537
- That's unconscionable.
- Nothing has actually happened.

38
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,705
Where's your gun?

39
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,441
Are you serious?

40
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,209
- Well, you need...
- I don't own a gun.

41
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,411
- You're gonna need something.
- That's not necessary.

42
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,814
- It's not necessary. -Dave, I don't think
you're taking this seriously enough.

43
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,882
I'm sorry, I kinda just
ambushed you, uh...

44
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,017
No, it's okay man.

45
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,485
- It's good. It's good.
- No. No, uh...

46
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:14,620
Do you want a beer?

47
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:15,854
- I would love one.
- Yeah?

48
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:16,722
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

49
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:18,924
I think I need some alcohol.

50
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,325
- Okay.
- Okay, great.

51
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,395
It's crazy, Dave.

52
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,931
It's fine. It's fine.

53
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,132
It's okay. It's okay.

54
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,070
Hi, sweet boy.

55
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,906
Hello.

56
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,885
So, what is going on with you?

57
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,589
Are you serious?
What's going on with me?

58
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,424
Yeah.

59
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,459
God damn, you're awesome.

60
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,497
I mean, here you are, dealing with
this potential stalker situation,

61
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:01,733
and you're concerned
with me and my feelings?

62
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,235
Mmm-hmm.

63
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:04,503
Fuckin' love you, man.

64
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:05,604
Aw.

65
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,139
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

66
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,775
Mm.

67
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,450
This is great, isn't it?

68
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,919
- Yeah.
- Two guys just hanging out,

69
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,854
throwing back
a couple of cold ones.

70
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,592
Really wish I didn't have to say
what I have to say to you tonight.

71
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,664
Oh. What's that?

72
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,471
I'm worried about us.

73
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,674
Mm.

74
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,711
- Oh, uh, you are?
- Aren't you?

75
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:49,514
Uh, us, we're good.
We're friends. We...

76
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,184
We hang out
sometimes. We're...

77
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,852
Come on, Dave.

78
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,621
You and I both know there's a
lot more at stake than that.

79
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,057
- Okay... -Meeting at
the same coffee shop,

80
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,692
in the same Tuesday morning,

81
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,096
reading the same exact
edition of<i> infinite jest?</i>

82
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:04,996
Hmm.

83
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,898
And if that wasn't kismet,

84
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,067
if we weren't meant to
be best friends or soulmates,

85
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,536
and started out so hot and
heavy like that, and then...

86
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,406
We turned into this...

87
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,609
Well, it's disappointing.

88
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,179
And I can't help
but think if we...

89
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,316
If we aren't
headed for greatness,

90
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:27,319
then maybe we just
end it right here...

91
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,788
Tonight.

92
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,923
Okay, I don't
think that's necessary.

93
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,526
Dave, if I ask you a question,
would you answer me honestly?

94
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,095
Yeah, of course.

95
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,266
Do you ever think about how...

96
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,036
We met right
around the same time

97
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,938
you received your
first DVD in the mail?

98
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,378
You just thought
about it, didn't you?

99
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,880
I didn't.

100
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,081
Dave, you just thought about it.

101
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,215
I didn't, I swear.

102
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,484
Dave, listen to me.
It's okay, okay?

103
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,586
Everything that's about to
happen to you here tonight

104
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,455
is okay, and it's
not your fault.

105
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:04,790
You understand me?

106
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:05,891
- No, I don't understand...
- Okay, now, listen.

107
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,460
There's a camera
inside this wolf, okay?

108
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,530
Now I've been filming you in some way,
shape, or form since the day we met.

109
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,465
This is baby peach fuzz.
Say hi.

110
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,467
I was gonna record
our entire relationship

111
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,736
and commemorate it with
a beautiful 80-minute film,

112
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,137
and you deserve that.

113
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,641
You deserve it because
you're a beautiful person,

114
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,377
and I want to give that
to you so bad, but...

115
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,246
I can't.

116
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,283
'Cause ever since I turned 40,

117
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,852
I don't know what's happening
to me, Dave. I just...

118
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,488
I've lost my inspiration,
I have no joy,

119
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,256
and my work...

120
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,158
I don't even know
if I can do this anymore.

121
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,268
- God damn it.

122
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,342
What's happening to me?

123
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,124
<i>Hi, I'm Sara.</i>

124
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,026
<i>Welcome to</i> encounters.

125
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:25,330
<i>The show where I look behind the
strange world of online personal ads</i>

126
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:28,667
<i>to try to uncover
the humanity underneath.</i>

127
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,001
- Hey, Wade.
- Hey.

128
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,102
I'm Sara.

129
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,404
Hey, Sara, how you doin'?

130
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,106
I hope you don't mind
I brought my camera.

131
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:38,243
If you don't mind, Marilyn Monroe
already lives in the wall.

132
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,811
Oh, yeah.

133
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,479
There she is.

134
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,215
So you were trying to make
your pottery earlier.

135
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,051
- Yeah.
- You were telling me about it.

136
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:49,254
<i>Who are these people
who write these ads?</i>

137
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,056
<i>What is their story?</i>

138
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,458
<i>This place has
a cold energy to it.</i>

139
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,626
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

140
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,995
<i>Most of the spirit pots
that I build</i>

141
00:09:56,997 --> 00:10:00,632
<i>are to deflect that cold energy.</i>

142
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,500
This is my little jaws 2.

143
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,603
He's a little shark.

144
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,104
- Yeah, it does look good.
- It does.

145
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,173
<i>Little jaws.</i>

146
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:10,399
<i>Maybe we're all a little bit weirder
than we give ourselves credit for.</i>

147
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,881
- May I come in?
- Yeah, come in.

148
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,884
What did you... What were you looking
for when you posted your ad?

149
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,286
You know...

150
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,256
You know, life is lonely.

151
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,058
- Yeah. -It's nice to
have someone to talk to.

152
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,602
<i>So subscribe

- Yeah.

156
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,377
Encounters.

157
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,291
No.

158
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,330
Nine views.

159
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,498
Awesome.

160
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:12,003
Hey, this is Sara.

161
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,605
Welcome to<i> encounters,</i>

162
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:16,207
the web series that
nobody gives a shit about,

163
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,711
and I am starting to realize
why nobody is watching.

164
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:22,313
It's because it sucks.

165
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,922
I think I might be
deeply untalented.

166
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,494
Aw, man.

167
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,864
I thought I had a talent for bringing
out something weird and special

168
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:43,301
and taboo and secret in people,

169
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,837
that there was a loneliness
that I could detect,

170
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,806
that I really empathized with.

171
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:52,077
And I... I see glimpses of it
sometimes, and it's so exciting.

172
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,412
And I'm close.
I can feel it,

173
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,681
but I never follow through
in the right way,

174
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:59,084
and I'm tired of trying,
and I'm tired of failing.

175
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,318
It is humiliating.

176
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,722
I never expected to
make money doing this,

177
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,925
but I thought at least I would be
able to reach some other weirdos

178
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,660
and make something
special for them.

179
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,132
So I'm Sara.

180
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,834
Welcome to<i> encounters.</i>

181
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:19,871
This is our finale, the closing
episode of the entire season.

182
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:23,208
Join me as we encounter...
My failure.

183
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,577
I hope you enjoy it.

184
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,848
Hey. Sorry about last night.

185
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,349
I got a little bit dramatic,

186
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,751
but I'm feeling
a lot better now.

187
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,085
I've had my coffee,

188
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,588
and... I found this.

189
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,994
"Looking for videographer.

190
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,496
$1000 for the day.

191
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,798
Honesty and
emotional bravery a must.

192
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,667
Fans of <i>interview with
the vampire</i> a plus.

193
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,669
Let's go deep. Together."

194
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,607
Interesting.

195
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,261
Oh.

196
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,010
Ah...

197
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,580
Fuck it.

198
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,728
What?

199
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,148
Here we are...

200
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,083
In the woods.

201
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,754
I've been driving
three hours now.

202
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,097
This is a lot more off road
than I had anticipated.

203
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,371
745.

204
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,813
Okay.

205
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,148
Hey.

206
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,283
Welcome to<i> encounters.</i>

207
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,086
I'm Sara. This is
episode 10 of 10.

208
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,722
And normally,
this is where I tell you

209
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,192
that I'm gonna go see John, a
mid-level manager at Walgreens,

210
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:57,095
and that we're gonna work through
his mommy issues through...

211
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,130
I don't know, synchronized
swimming or some shit,

212
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,332
but I don't have that today.

213
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,001
I know very little
about this guy.

214
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:06,337
He's been ghosting me
since he sent me his address,

215
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:10,475
and I have no idea
what I'm stepping into.

216
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:14,679
Normally, this is not a situation
I would allow myself to get into,

217
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,949
but maybe that's why this show
has been sucking so much.

218
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,350
So let's see what happens.

219
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,305
Hello?

220
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,860
Hello, I'm Sara.

221
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:06,864
Oh.

222
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,533
Sorry.

223
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,409
Hi.

224
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:19,344
Hi.

225
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,545
Green smoothie?

226
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,413
Okay.

227
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,350
Very healthy.

228
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,787
Kale, four frozen strawberries,

229
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:34,025
one banana, one heaping tablespoon
of non-fat plain Greek yogurt,

230
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:37,395
two pinches spirulina and
one pinch of cinnamon.

231
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,997
Thank you.

232
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,331
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

233
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,135
It's good.

234
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,470
It's also poisoned.

235
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:47,739
Obviously I'm kidding.

236
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,707
I'm Aaron.

237
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:50,742
Sara.

238
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,413
Wow. That's your real name.

239
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:56,948
Yeah.

240
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,584
Yeah, I can tell.

241
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,786
Thanks for that.

242
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:02,920
You're welcome.

243
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,225
Can we start with a hug?

244
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,227
Okay.

245
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,729
Mm.

246
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,532
I like that you came in
already filming.

247
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,934
Yeah, I want you
to get your money's worth.

248
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,537
Yeah. You know, people
don't really believe in that.

249
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,706
You got to keep the camera on
if you wanna keep the magic.

250
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,874
I mean... you know.

251
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,643
You and I kinda have a thing.
I like that.

252
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:29,447
That's a nice camera, by the way.
Are you a filmmaker by trade?

253
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:32,683
I shoot wedding videos
to make money.

254
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,987
I'm actually applying to grad school
right now. I'm trying to save up.

255
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:37,321
Mm. You don't do
anything else?

256
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,157
No.

257
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,193
Cool.

258
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,928
What about you?
What's your story?

259
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,031
My story, um...

260
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:50,635
I am what is commonly
known as a serial killer.

261
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:53,104
Um, I don't love
that nomenclature.

262
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,039
I sort of consider
myself a murderer,

263
00:17:55,041 --> 00:18:00,678
but, uh, my numbers are such that I'm
now classified as a serial killer.

264
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,613
- Serial killer?
- Yes, I am a killer.

265
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,449
I have killed 39 people.

266
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,084
This is something
that I love to do.

267
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,318
It's the greatest job
in the world.

268
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,619
That's what I'm built to do.

269
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,055
Um, but I'm also
turning 40 this year,

270
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:14,125
which is like, grays in the
beards, a lot of stuff happening,

271
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,461
and it's making me
a little mid-lifey,

272
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:19,630
and it's kind of set me
into a little bit of a spiral.

273
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:24,235
And I think I fucked
myself in the head.

274
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,671
I don't trust
my instincts anymore,

275
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:30,708
and I feel like I may have
lost what made me great.

276
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,611
There was a time in my life when

277
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,079
I would meet a man at a bar

278
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,682
and I would take him outside
and lay him on the floor,

279
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:41,052
and I would put a knife
in his chest and cut him open.

280
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,221
And... open his insides,

281
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:46,657
and the universe would reveal
itself to me, and it was beautiful.

282
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:51,262
And I felt part of every time and every
place that had ever existed. It...

283
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,731
It was my religion.

284
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,533
But now, it...

285
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,871
It's like a job.

286
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:05,143
And it makes me
really fucking sad.

287
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,412
And I don't wanna get emotional,

288
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:11,215
but, um, I'm having a hard time.

289
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,485
But then,

290
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,255
I read an article about
the great Francis Ford Coppola.

291
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:20,858
He said something that
blew my fucking mind.

292
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,929
He said, "I've not made an original
film since <i>the conversation</i> in 1974.

293
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,731
I am not sure I'm capable of it,

294
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,500
but I really wanna
keep trying."

295
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,069
And then it hit me
like a sack of bricks.

296
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:35,673
Here's a man who's in the middle
of his artistic decline...

297
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,709
Is he running from it?
No, he's embracing it.

298
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,211
So, I'm like...

299
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,680
What am I doing, trying to make
the films that I used to make?

300
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,416
What if I embrace
where I'm at right now?

301
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:48,286
What if I make a documentary?

302
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,288
And this is where you come in.

303
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,592
A documentary about the world's
most prolific serial killer

304
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,861
that no one knows about.

305
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,497
A documentary that
you and I make here,

306
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,965
tonight.

307
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,701
I mean, like,

308
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,870
I realize I'm throwing
a lot at you.

309
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,339
You haven't even had the chance
to finish your green smoothie,

310
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,941
so if you wanna bail,

311
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:11,409
I completely understand.

312
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,911
Take your money,
no hard feelings.

313
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,213
I understand.

314
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,915
But if you don't...

315
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,718
And I really hope you don't...

316
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,456
I can offer you two things.

317
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,859
Firstly, I won't kill you
over the next 24 hours.

318
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,928
That would be
counter-productive.

319
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,097
And secondly,

320
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:37,101
I will give you the deepest
personal access into my soul

321
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,502
that you could possibly imagine.

322
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,238
I will rip myself open

323
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,941
and let you see
every last inch of me.

324
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:47,545
And together, I believe
we will make magic.

325
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,749
But you gotta be into it.

326
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,818
I'm into it.

327
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:59,123
Are you just saying you're into
it because you want a job?

328
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,593
No, I've heard you out,
and I think this sounds great.

329
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,694
Wanna do it?

330
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,663
I don't hear any
passion in your voice.

331
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,569
Aaron, I wanna make
this film with you.

332
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,675
Hmm.

333
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,549
What am I looking at here?

334
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,418
You'll see.

335
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,393
Who's this guy?

336
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,161
He's my friend.

337
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:45,803
Is that you?

338
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,438
Sara...

339
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,940
All good things
to those who wait.

340
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,675
Oh.

341
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,405
Shit.

342
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,553
So...

343
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:15,926
What do you think?

344
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,900
I think it's interesting.

345
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:23,868
Mmm-hmm.

346
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,069
Did it scare you?

347
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,309
Did you want it to scare me?

348
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,312
Hmm.

349
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:36,414
I'll be right back.

350
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,591
Fuck.

351
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,996
What the fuck?

352
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,110
So.

353
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,513
I was thinking upstairs that...

354
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,250
When men are in the locker room,

355
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:16,320
they snap towels
at each other's genitals

356
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,055
without any inhibitions.

357
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:22,927
Uh, when women try on
clothes in changing rooms,

358
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:25,396
there is no barrier
to their intimacy.

359
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:27,898
But with a man and a woman,

360
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,967
there is always a wall
between them.

361
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,237
And that wall is...

362
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,473
"I wonder what
you look like naked."

363
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,943
And if I'm being honest,

364
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:40,945
that's something I've felt.

365
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,118
And if we're gonna embark
on this journey together,

366
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,789
we need to tear that wall down.

367
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:52,923
Do you agree?

368
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:53,925
I agree.

369
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,137
How do you feel?

370
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,208
I'm good.

371
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,309
You?

372
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,081
I just think it's important
that there is a wall

373
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,250
and a gender divide.

374
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:21,986
This is a spiritual journey,
so we need to eradicate it.

375
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,055
I agree.

376
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,093
Okay.

377
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:30,194
Then we're good.

378
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,362
Is it my turn?

379
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,598
I'm sorry?

380
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,467
Um, can it be my turn now?

381
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:37,735
Here.

382
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:39,603
Uh...

383
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,405
You can sit down.

384
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:43,173
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

385
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,547
You got your frame?

386
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,549
Yeah. Yeah.

387
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,344
Are we good?

388
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,584
Yeah.

389
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,520
Okay.

390
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:30,754
I'll be right back.

391
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,334
Holy shit. Holy shit.
Holy shit.

392
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,571
Okay.

393
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,708
Okay.

394
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:54,445
Sara, every red flag
you have has been raised.

395
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:59,249
Um, he is highly unpredictable
and potentially dangerous,

396
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:04,254
and you were not there for ten minutes
before his dick was in your face.

397
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:07,491
Sara, you were not there for ten minutes
before his dick was in your face.

398
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:10,194
He is everything you
ever wanted in a subject.

399
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:11,795
You have to chase this.

400
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,464
Sara, come on,
we're losing light.

401
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,598
I'm coming.

402
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,206
I have to do this.

403
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,811
I'm like 99.9% positive
he is not a killer.

404
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,781
But just in case, because I'm
not a total fucking idiot...

405
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:32,516
Knife.

406
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:35,552
I'm coming.

407
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:36,720
One minute.

408
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,859
Hey, I'm Sara.

409
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:43,394
Welcome to<i> encounters.</i>

410
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:45,896
Here we fucking go.

411
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

412
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,909
Are you ready to go?

413
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:01,011
Wow. You're
a tough nut to crack.

414
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:02,913
Mm...

415
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,249
What's with your beard here?

416
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:06,617
What... what do you mean?

417
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:08,152
Right there.

418
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:11,689
Oh, this. That's just
my beard pattern.

419
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:14,692
Some men have little patches.
This is one of my patches.

420
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,627
Um, all right,
we should get going.

421
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
We are losing light.
Okay.

422
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,704
Aaron, come on.

423
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:27,706
Really?

424
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,941
All right.

425
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:32,409
I'll get you at some point.

426
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:34,878
We'll see about that.

427
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,481
Where are you from?

428
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,057
So where did you grow up?

429
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,895
What do you think about my mask?

430
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:55,265
As a passenger,
I'm not super excited about it.

431
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,034
Can you see in that thing?

432
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:58,669
Oh, now you're scared?

433
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,841
Do you believe in god?

434
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:06,310
It could complicate
what you do for a living.

435
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:08,979
You still haven't answered
my question about my mask.

436
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:11,815
I think it's cute.

437
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,091
Really?

438
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,593
Sure.

439
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,994
You're a cute little wolf.

440
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,833
What would you say if I told you

441
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:32,503
I'm a naughty wolf?

442
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:35,405
I'd say that's very scary
coming from someone like you.

443
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,608
Okay.

444
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,110
Well, what if I told you that
at the end of this road,

445
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,346
I was gonna cut off your head

446
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:43,914
and snugglefuck it?

447
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,424
Did you have
any friends growing up?

448
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:55,492
Uh-huh.

449
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,095
Did you have a best friend?

450
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,330
Sure.

451
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,501
You think your best friend...

452
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,937
You're asking a lot
of questions. Um...

453
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,006
I'm sorry.

454
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:11,341
I have a perfect, idyllic spot
picked out for this interview.

455
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:12,810
Can we just...

456
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,945
Let's just save it. Okay?

457
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,680
Okay.

458
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,649
Okay.

459
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,250
Thanks, Sara.

460
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:21,318
You're gonna love it.

461
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,527
Oh, this is really nice.

462
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:33,063
No. No, no!

463
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,499
Where's the water?

464
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,335
Where's the fucking water?

465
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,304
That's the water.

466
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:44,408
No, no, no. The raging river of water that
was here when I scouted it. It was...

467
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,643
You know, I had
the whole shot planned.

468
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:47,711
I was gonna be here,

469
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,680
submerged in the water
up to my neck

470
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,715
for the whole Jesus metaphor

471
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:55,152
and that's the... I mean, and the...
the bridge!

472
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:57,321
That was the final scene.

473
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:59,456
I was gonna jump off the bridge,
splash into the water,

474
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,592
you cut to
something really cool,

475
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:04,094
I mean, that's the ending
of the scene. We...

476
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:06,864
We don't even have a scene.

477
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:09,333
This is not...

478
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:10,968
This is...

479
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,304
This is... no. No, no!

480
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,106
Aaron?

481
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,542
Hold on. I'm gonna.
I gotta think about this.

482
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,717
- Aaron.
- What!

483
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:29,987
Coppola.

484
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,124
Poppola?

485
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,226
Coppola.

486
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,428
Why are you
saying Coppola? What...

487
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,463
Aaron.

488
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:43,901
Francis Ford Coppola.

489
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,103
What would he do?

490
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:52,476
Huh.

491
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,783
That's really fuckin' smart.

492
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,794
December 1978.

493
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:13,263
It was the last days of disco.

494
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,033
The cold war was
heating up by the minute.

495
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,135
But in a nondescript home,

496
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:20,270
in a nondescript town...

497
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,839
Sorry, what are you
doing with your arms?

498
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:26,877
This is, uh, well, if the visual
effects of the water's up here,

499
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:28,912
this would be me
just sort of floating...

500
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,647
- Ah. - ...With it. You
know what I'm saying?

501
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,749
- Yeah, I don't think... -this
one feels a little more real.

502
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,451
What do you think?
Should we...

503
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,552
I don't think you need it.

504
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:36,954
- We don't need it?
- No.

505
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,892
Sorry, I got a little...
I got some sunblock in my eye.

506
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,660
Mm.

507
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,500
Airplane.

508
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:52,102
Wait. Let's wait
for the sound...

509
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,740
It's a really slow airplane.

510
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,209
How's the pony?

511
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,744
- Beautiful.
- Yeah?

512
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:02,546
- You sure?
- Yep.

513
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:05,615
Would you mind coming up real quick
and just giving me a little fix?

514
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:06,701
Um, yeah. Okay.

515
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:09,977
Sorry, I don't want to get your shoes wet,
but I just wanna make sure it's right.

516
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,990
- Okay.
- Yeah, come on up.

517
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:21,732
Just tighten it.

518
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,601
Oh, I didn't want you to redo...

519
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:25,902
Oh, that's okay.
No problem.

520
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:27,584
We'll do it. We'll just
do the whole thing.

521
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:35,078
December 1978.

522
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,347
It was the last days of disco.

523
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,217
The cold war was
just heating up,

524
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:41,718
but in a small tow...

525
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,189
Little bird right there.
Hold on.

526
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,794
- December 19...

527
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,098
it's like a bad joke.

528
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,533
Hey.

529
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,637
One more.
Try it one more time.

530
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:01,705
One more time.

531
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,042
I want you to do it.

532
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:06,643
I want you to do it!

533
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,745
Hey! No!

534
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:09,880
No!

535
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,748
No! This is my movie...

536
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,953
It was December 1978.

537
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,122
It was the last days of disco.

538
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,490
The cold war was just...

539
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,492
I'm getting a lot of shadow
on your face.

540
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,762
You wanna retake this?

541
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,467
Aaron?

542
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:39,709
I'm gonna take a break.

543
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,344
Okay.

544
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,316
If you'll excuse me.

545
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Aaron?

546
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:11,608
Okay, so it turns out Aaron
is a bit of a drama queen.

547
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:16,980
I'm not sure if
he's used to collaboration.

548
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,088
Aaron?

549
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,374
This day might be a wash.

550
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:49,279
- I'm just not...

551
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:51,815
Aaron?

552
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,519
Aaron, is that you?

553
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,044
Aaron?

554
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:05,789
Don't leave.

555
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:08,959
I won't.

556
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,513
Hey.

557
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,516
Aaron's not talking anymore.

558
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:36,453
He's kind of shut down
since his tantrum at the river.

559
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,154
And I don't know
if you can hear it,

560
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:41,891
but he's been blasting the same
shit '90s jam band song on loop

561
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,393
for the past hour.

562
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,931
He's so vulnerable right now,

563
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:51,268
and I know the decent thing to
do is just give him some space,

564
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,838
but at the same time, it would
be so easy to go down there

565
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,072
and provoke him...

566
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,675
And get the material I need.

567
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,558
Go.

568
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:51,628
Why should I go?

569
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,063
'Cause I want you to go.

570
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,300
How come?

571
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:59,903
Because I don't want you to
make this documentary anymore.

572
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:01,871
Take your money and go, please.

573
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,273
What's going on?

574
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:04,974
- What's the problem?
- Sara, leave.

575
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,312
Aaron, I'm not leaving.

576
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,450
I'm sorry.

577
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:15,819
You told me once we got started,

578
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,387
there was no turning back.

579
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,358
I'm not turning back.

580
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:25,295
Turn that song back on.

581
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,896
Why?

582
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,631
Because I said so.

583
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:29,933
Tell me why.

584
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:32,035
Because it's my favorite
song in the world,

585
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,070
and I need it because I love it.

586
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,606
What do you love about it?

587
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:40,410
Um, maybe because it does more
with one instrumental slow jam

588
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:45,014
than any poet with any quill has ever
done in the history of time, ever.

589
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:46,649
I've never heard of it before.

590
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,818
Well, you wouldn't have.

591
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,921
Barely anyone has.
It's from an unknown band

592
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:53,923
from a long time ago.

593
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,260
Tell me about it.

594
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:59,742
Sara, I know what you're trying
to do, and it's not gonna work.

595
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,500
Why won't you tell me
about it, Aaron?

596
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:05,602
Because...

597
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:09,239
You think you want to
know my story,

598
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:12,542
but I promise you, you do
not wanna know my story.

599
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,844
But I do.

600
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:15,945
Oh, you do?

601
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,681
Really?

602
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,917
Yes.

603
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:22,886
Fine.

604
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:27,223
I was 15 years old,
but I could pass for 18

605
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:28,792
'cause I was big for my age.

606
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:31,194
I could go to bars
and see live music.

607
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:34,264
An obscure band came to town.

608
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,466
There weren't more than
seven of us in the audience,

609
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:38,034
but I was mesmerized,

610
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:43,006
in particular by a song called
"Sara loves her juicy fruit."

611
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,908
It transported me.

612
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,310
That night, I went
out of town with the band

613
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,679
and I partied with them
where they were staying.

614
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,716
I felt like I belonged
for the first time.

615
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,886
But of course,

616
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:59,689
they had to move on
to another city the next day.

617
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,526
I walked back towards town,

618
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:05,829
and a man pulled over
to offer me a ride.

619
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:10,033
He had a nice, kind face.

620
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:11,868
And as he opened the door,
he said something to me.

621
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,536
I'll never forget it.
He said...

622
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,505
"Oh, my god.

623
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,007
Oh, my god.

624
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,144
This is gonna be a good day."

625
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,547
He didn't take me back to town,

626
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,616
he took me to
a remote part of the woods

627
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:29,419
where he beat me
within an inch of my life.

628
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:32,922
He gave me a shovel, he forced
me to dig my own grave,

629
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:36,226
he tied my hands behind
my back and informed me

630
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:40,096
that he would be burying me alive
within the next couple of minutes.

631
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,932
And I remember
thinking to myself,

632
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:46,703
"I should be feeling
really badly about this man,"

633
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:50,039
but he was magnetic.

634
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,908
I loved him.

635
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,311
He was smart, he was commanding,

636
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:57,313
he was wonderful in all ways.

637
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:58,915
He only had one flaw.

638
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:02,352
He was not very good
at tying knots.

639
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:06,256
And as I loosened my hands
from behind my back,

640
00:42:06,258 --> 00:42:08,691
and I wrapped them
around his neck,

641
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,594
overpowering him with my size,

642
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,664
I drained...

643
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,599
His life

644
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:19,669
with my hands.

645
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:21,604
And I thought to myself,

646
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,709
"well, this is my destiny.

647
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:31,147
Sara loves her juicy fruit.

648
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:35,218
And Aaron loves to kill."

649
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,855
I stripped him of his clothes,

650
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:41,424
I threw his body in the hole
he made me dig for myself,

651
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:44,227
and on instinct,
I took off my own clothes,

652
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:47,931
and I lay there communing
next to him, all night, naked.

653
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:50,533
And something very
interesting happened.

654
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:51,768
You see...

655
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:55,138
I lied to you earlier.

656
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,339
About what?

657
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:58,207
About my beard holes.

658
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,877
It's not my hair pattern.

659
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:05,281
It's actually a rare disease
called trichotillomania.

660
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:08,217
You know, people pull hairs out
of their beard or their scalp

661
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:09,419
or even their eyebrows.

662
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,854
You see, my first victim
had this disease,

663
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:14,123
and when I lay with him naked,

664
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:18,728
my spirit consumed that
from his spirit...

665
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,396
And it became a ritual of mine.

666
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:23,333
All of my victims,
I lay with them naked,

667
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:25,401
and I take a part
of them with me.

668
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,871
And here I am now,

669
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:32,075
a strange but
wonderful amalgamation

670
00:43:32,077 --> 00:43:35,345
of all the 39 men and women
that I have killed,

671
00:43:35,347 --> 00:43:38,615
and it has been the most
glorious part of my life.

672
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:42,185
It has been my<i> raison d'etre.</i>

673
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,754
And now...

674
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,757
It's gone.

675
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:54,697
And that is why I'm sad.

676
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:57,667
And that is why I have
nothing to live for anymore.

677
00:43:57,669 --> 00:44:00,803
And that is why I want
you to go, because tonight

678
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,272
is going to be a very...

679
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,974
Bad...

680
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,077
Bad night.

681
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,346
Aaron.

682
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:11,381
Sara.

683
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,916
Stay right there.

684
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:37,840
Close your eyes.

685
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,008
I don't want to.

686
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,010
Do it.

687
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,018
- Shh...

688
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,888
Shh...

689
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,725
Shh...

690
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,673
Do you feel better?

691
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,477
A little bit.

692
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:15,479
Good.

693
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,985
I'm gonna go take a shower now.

694
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,879
Hey, Sara,
it's me. Um...

695
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,148
Thank you...

696
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,417
For...

697
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,654
Um...

698
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:03,326
Doing what you just did. I think
you are really, really...

699
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,028
Special.

700
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:10,933
And you are inspiring
feelings in me that...

701
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,603
I thought I would
never feel again,

702
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,104
and...

703
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,276
I don't know what to do.

704
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

705
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,524
Oh, my god.

706
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,226
Oh, god, you got me.

707
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:44,861
Yeah?

708
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,062
How do you feel?

709
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,930
I feel like...

710
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,543
Forty-seven...

711
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,812
Forty-eight,

712
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,514
forty-nine,

713
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,216
fifty.

714
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,086
Ready or not, here I come!

715
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:16,893
Sara?

716
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,794
Where'd you go?

717
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,865
I'm coming for you.

718
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,268
I got...

719
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,904
Uh-oh.

720
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,007
I think I found you.

721
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:37,947
Sara?

722
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,384
Are you being bad?

723
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Sara, where's you go?

724
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,029
Damn it!

725
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:54,497
You got me!

726
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:56,332
You don't scare me.

727
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,306
Are you rolling, Sara?

728
00:49:03,308 --> 00:49:04,308
Yeah.

729
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,015
Aaron, if ask you a question,

730
00:49:13,017 --> 00:49:14,550
will you answer honestly?

731
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:16,752
Of course. Always.

732
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,157
When you're holding that ax,

733
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:25,361
is there a part of you that
wants to ram it into my face?

734
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:30,066
You know, considering your past?

735
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,335
Well, of course.

736
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:35,738
But then...

737
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,874
You know, we wouldn't be able to
have all the fun we are having.

738
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,812
That's interesting. I...

739
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:45,247
I think I always thought
I was gonna die

740
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:48,317
before I could share
my work with anyone,

741
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,621
but now I have you.

742
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,325
Which is kinda cool.

743
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,668
Do you feel remorse
for the people you kill?

744
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,304
Um...

745
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:10,306
Maybe a little bit,
but I also...

746
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:12,141
I feel like I'm pretty
fair to my victims.

747
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:15,411
I try to give them a warning as
to what they're walking into.

748
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:18,647
That's why I put stuff
in the ad, like...

749
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:20,649
"Are you a fan of
<i>interview with the vampire?"</i>

750
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:23,019
Like, I want them to know
that I'm dangerous.

751
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:25,087
You know...
Actually, this is...

752
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,724
One of my latest
was this big ol' sweetie

753
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:30,259
and... I called him "buddy."

754
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:34,296
And I stuck an ax in a stump

755
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:36,399
outside of the house I rented.

756
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,635
He passed by, he saw it,

757
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:43,139
he came in anyway and he stayed
with me all night, you know.

758
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:44,573
I mean, it's almost like...

759
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:48,677
It's almost like...
Like they wanna die.

760
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,247
Did you kill him with that ax?

761
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:53,682
Uh-huh.

762
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:56,118
Does that mean you're gonna
murder me with the blender?

763
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,888
That's actually
a brilliant idea.

764
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:01,090
I've never thought of that
as a weapon before.

765
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,226
But alas, Sara...

766
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,228
I promised I wouldn't kill you.

767
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,596
And I never lie.

768
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,198
Not in the cards for us.

769
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,002
Well...

770
00:51:13,004 --> 00:51:15,704
But you said you wouldn't kill me
within the next 24 hours. So...

771
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:22,878
Now why would you bring that up?

772
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:25,915
That only gets you into trouble.

773
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:41,664
Hey.

774
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:42,731
Hey.

775
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:43,899
What you doin'?

776
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:45,000
The dishes.

777
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:48,704
What are you doing
with my camera?

778
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,343
Have you ever spent
any time in the woods?

779
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:56,512
Sure.

780
00:51:58,248 --> 00:51:59,515
You ever...

781
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,152
Just watched a deer, just...

782
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,721
Just being a deer?

783
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:13,963
Put that away. That's my job.

784
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,365
Okay.

785
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:23,139
Psst.

786
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,220
Mommy needs her juice.

787
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,590
Where is mommy's juice?

788
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:51,433
Mommy is thirsty.
Oh, yes!

789
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:53,068
This better be Coppola wine.

790
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:55,738
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

791
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,506
Mmm.

792
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,508
- That's nice. Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

793
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,344
What are you thinking about?

794
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,614
Uh, I'm thinking about this really
cool book that I once read,

795
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:07,316
called<i> the journalist</i>
<i>and the murderer.</i>

796
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:08,717
- Have you heard of it?
- No.

797
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,599
Oh, it's really great.
You gotta give it a read.

798
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,289
What's it about?

799
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:17,059
It's sort of about the moral quandary
that journalists face, you know,

800
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:19,628
uh, how they
sometimes have to lie

801
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:22,464
and ingratiate themselves
with their subjects, you know,

802
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:26,202
this little flattery and little
flirtation to get the material they need.

803
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,604
And...

804
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:30,806
I thought about it
while I was...

805
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:33,475
Watching a little show
called<i> encounters.</i>

806
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,615
Didn't know I knew
about that, did you?

807
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:42,484
I know a lot of things, Sara.

808
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,087
Like what?

809
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:46,822
Oh, no, you don't
make wedding videos.

810
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:50,793
Um, and I know you have
a knife in your boot.

811
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:56,065
- What are you talking about?
- It's okay.

812
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,900
Don't worry
about it, okay? Look.

813
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:00,836
Let's see.

814
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:02,938
I don't think you've been "lying"
here, traditionally, you know.

815
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,741
I think you've been, uh, you've been playing
around with the facts a little bit,

816
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,810
but look, everybody
does that, okay?

817
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:09,345
Look, it's one of
my favorite things to do.

818
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:10,546
It's what I do for a living.

819
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:11,814
But...

820
00:54:11,816 --> 00:54:13,949
While I do play
around with facts,

821
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:16,619
I never lie.

822
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:21,056
My eyes, my heart, my soul,
I always tell the truth

823
00:54:21,058 --> 00:54:24,126
and that's the same kind of truth I've
been feeling from you here today.

824
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:27,096
So I want you to know

825
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:30,065
everything's okay.
I'm not mad. Okay?

826
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:32,434
Okay.

827
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,236
That said,

828
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:36,872
I'm gonna ask you a question and I
want you to answer me honestly.

829
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:40,909
Do you believe that
I'm a serial killer?

830
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,715
- No. -Good. Thank you
for your honesty.

831
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:47,717
Why not?

832
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,319
Well...

833
00:54:50,321 --> 00:54:53,455
First off, the stories you've
been telling are ridiculous.

834
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:54,757
Okay.

835
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:57,826
And, like, what's up
with this whole documentary?

836
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,095
If you were a killer,

837
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:03,499
why would you invite me into
your home and have me film you

838
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:05,801
confess all the details
of your murders?

839
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,904
Like, what would stop me from
going to the police with this?

840
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:10,139
It's a fair point.

841
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,876
It is a moot point, however.

842
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:16,478
You won't go to
the police tomorrow,

843
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,315
because tomorrow,
I'll be dead...

844
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:22,785
Because tonight,

845
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,321
you are going to kill me.

846
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,891
- Aaron...
- Now before you protest,

847
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:30,859
I've thought about this.

848
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:33,896
I'm very excited about it, okay?

849
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:37,066
Why would I make my 40th film
another random kill film?

850
00:55:37,068 --> 00:55:38,867
I made 39 of those, okay?

851
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:42,471
Also, why would we make some
stodgy, pedantic documentary?

852
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:44,206
Plenty of those.

853
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:45,741
You know what we need?

854
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,210
A murder film...

855
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,145
Where the pupil

856
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:53,215
fells the king.

857
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:55,117
That's the movie I wanna make.

858
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,454
What makes you think
I'm gonna do this?

859
00:55:58,456 --> 00:56:01,824
Because I know you well enough to
know that you will do anything

860
00:56:01,826 --> 00:56:03,559
to make a great piece of art.

861
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:07,730
And this will be the most

862
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:11,433
unbelievably exciting
episode of<i> encounters</i>

863
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:13,702
that you can possibly imagine.

864
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,807
I know I just laid a lot on you,

865
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:20,442
but I have a lot
of experience with this

866
00:56:20,444 --> 00:56:21,610
and I'm the easy way to it.

867
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:22,911
- I'm super excited.
- Aaron, what is...

868
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:24,747
First things first.
Put that camera down, girl.

869
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:25,781
What are you doing?

870
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:34,423
I said put
that camera down, girl.

871
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:36,125
What's with the mask, Aaron?

872
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:38,227
Now you remember, this is peach
fuzz, the friendly wolf.

873
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:39,261
Here, give me the camera.

874
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:41,330
Okay.

875
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,399
Okay.

876
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:45,134
Come with me.
Come with me.

877
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:47,469
How are you with an ax?

878
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:48,871
I've never used an ax before.

879
00:56:48,873 --> 00:56:50,439
Okay, it's like a bat.

880
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:52,141
Are you a lefty
or are you a righty?

881
00:56:52,143 --> 00:56:54,676
- Righty. -Okay, you know what, it
doesn't matter. Just get into it.

882
00:56:54,678 --> 00:56:56,512
Okay, I'm wearing a mask

883
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:59,047
so you don't have to look into
my eyes while you kill me.

884
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:00,616
It's a little difficult.

885
00:57:00,618 --> 00:57:02,684
Did I mention, it's like a
cartoon, like a funny noise.

886
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:04,653
Also, I sharpened the ax.

887
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:06,355
It should go straight
through my neck.

888
00:57:06,357 --> 00:57:09,091
There are very few bones.
Let's do it!

889
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:10,959
Okay, so, just to be clear,

890
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:13,629
you want me to take this ax

891
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:15,597
and chop your head off with it.

892
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,434
Yes, 100%.
Camera heard it first.

893
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:21,703
Consider it assisted suicide.
It's totally cool.

894
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:22,738
All right.

895
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:24,573
Any last words?

896
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,041
Nope.

897
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:27,943
I've talked enough
for ten lifetimes.

898
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,179
Wait. Wait.

899
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,318
Okay. Go for it.

900
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:38,754
Whenever you're ready.

901
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,192
Just reach back
and take a swing.

902
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:47,930
What's wrong?

903
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:55,137
- You all right, Sara?
- Yeah.

904
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:57,039
- Got your frame?
- Yep.

905
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:58,173
Okie dokie.

906
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,908
Okay.

907
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,677
So, this is a much better idea.

908
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:03,512
I should have thought of this
in the first place.

909
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:07,316
This is essentially going to turn
this into a passive endeavor.

910
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:09,651
What I' going to do,
I'm gonna jump off the ledge,

911
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,720
and unless you come and save me,

912
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:13,055
I'm gonna die,

913
00:58:13,057 --> 00:58:15,724
which make you complicit
in the murder.

914
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,292
Pretty cool, right?

915
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:19,394
I mean, obviously, not as cool as
putting an ax through my neck,

916
00:58:19,396 --> 00:58:21,330
but for a first-timer,

917
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:22,464
it'll do.

918
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,199
Ready, Sara?

919
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,836
Actually, to be
honest, I don't...

920
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,139
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

921
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:32,307
Pull yourself up.

922
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,413
Can you breathe?

923
00:58:38,415 --> 00:58:40,549
Aaron? Aaron!

924
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:42,117
- Aaron!

925
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:45,787
Sara.

926
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:48,624
Sara?

927
00:58:48,626 --> 00:58:49,725
You in here?

928
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:51,426
Hello...

929
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:52,694
Where'd you go?

930
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,269
Hey, there you are.

931
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:01,436
Okay, so...

932
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:02,871
Before sunrise,

933
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,273
put the camera above us.

934
00:59:04,275 --> 00:59:06,675
I play you <i>"Sara loves
her juicy fruit"...</i>

935
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:10,178
What are you doing?

936
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,616
Are you leaving?

937
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:19,254
Jesus.

938
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:22,291
- Sara, did I freak you out by
hanging myself? -Fuck off.

939
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:23,959
What?

940
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:25,627
I said "fuck off."

941
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:30,465
I'm so...

942
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:32,935
Please don't go. Please.

943
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:35,604
Do you have any idea
how fucked up that was?

944
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,674
I'm sorry. I was...

945
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:40,609
I can't believe you
put me in that position.

946
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,814
Can you just stop for a
second so I can explain?

947
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:46,882
What is wrong with you?

948
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:48,550
Okay, wait, just give me one...

949
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:50,218
What's wrong with you?

950
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,740
One second, please. Just promise
me you won't leave. One second.

951
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:00,162
Please.

952
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,134
What the fuck is this?

953
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:09,204
It's a harness.

954
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:19,615
That's what I was wearing underneath
my shirt when I hanged myself.

955
01:00:19,617 --> 01:00:21,350
I connected a black wire
to the harness,

956
01:00:21,352 --> 01:00:23,318
so I was hanging by my chest,
and I wouldn't...

957
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,754
Actually hang myself.

958
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:31,360
Look...

959
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:34,229
I'm sorry it freaked you out.

960
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:36,298
I thought...

961
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,533
I don't know what
I was thinking. I'm just...

962
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,906
Look, I'm not really good
at this, okay,

963
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:46,341
but I'm just gonna
lay it out there.

964
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:51,413
I really, really like you.

965
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:55,817
And I'm just trying
to connect with you.

966
01:00:55,819 --> 01:01:00,022
I'm not really
doing a very good job.

967
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:02,391
And I know you don't really
wanna connect with me, so...

968
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:06,094
What I figured I would do is

969
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:08,363
give you what
I can give you, which is...

970
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:15,003
The best episode of<i> encounters.</i>

971
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:18,073
I can give you. I can...

972
01:01:18,075 --> 01:01:21,710
Be a fucked up guy
and show you...

973
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:24,713
Everything that

974
01:01:24,715 --> 01:01:27,149
hopefully gives you
what you want as an artist.

975
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,887
Look...

976
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,025
Am I a murderer?

977
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,394
No.

978
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,732
Of course I'm not a murderer.

979
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:45,000
Am I a...

980
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:49,604
Sociopathic pathological liar,

981
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:53,175
who is completely disconnected
from the world and people?

982
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,609
Yes.

983
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,282
Am I majorly connecting with you

984
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:02,551
and having a fucking
great time today,

985
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:08,023
because I get to just lie and be
weird like I really like to do?

986
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:09,691
Yes.

987
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:10,926
I just...

988
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:13,628
I really like you.

989
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:17,099
And I think you're incredible.

990
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:21,403
Thank you.

991
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:27,542
You're welcome.

992
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:30,512
I think it will make
a really good scene.

993
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:34,416
I know, right?

994
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,518
I'm sorry I freaked you out.

995
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,153
You freaked me out.

996
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:39,554
I'm so sorry.

997
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,860
What are we doing?

998
01:02:44,862 --> 01:02:46,061
We're gonna play a game.

999
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:48,396
What kind of game
are we playing?

1000
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:55,070
It's called
"two lies and a truth."

1001
01:02:55,072 --> 01:02:56,705
You play this game
in your castle?

1002
01:02:56,707 --> 01:02:57,939
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

1003
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:59,608
So in "two lies and a truth"...

1004
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,643
- Mmm-hmm. - ...You're gonna
tell three stories,

1005
01:03:01,645 --> 01:03:03,345
and one of them will be true.

1006
01:03:03,347 --> 01:03:05,881
And none of that bullshit,
like, from your heart...

1007
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:07,449
I got you. I got you.

1008
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,848
I want facts that are
technically correct.

1009
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:11,019
Okay. All right.

1010
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:12,254
Two lies, one truth.

1011
01:03:12,256 --> 01:03:14,156
And I get to guess
which one is the truth.

1012
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:15,158
Okay.

1013
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:20,495
I was born
three months premature.

1014
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,665
I have never slept with a woman.

1015
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:29,271
I can hold my breath for
two and a half minutes.

1016
01:03:29,273 --> 01:03:30,273
Okay.

1017
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,742
I think that it's...

1018
01:03:33,744 --> 01:03:35,844
The... the breath one.

1019
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:36,945
It's number two.

1020
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:42,784
You want me to be honest,
it's number two.

1021
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:47,289
You're fucking with me.

1022
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:50,358
I... I wish I was.

1023
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,760
Did it look like
I was fucking with you

1024
01:03:51,762 --> 01:03:53,261
when you came on to me
in the hot tub?

1025
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:55,030
Did it look like
I knew what I was doing?

1026
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:57,532
It was just a weird...

1027
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,601
Series of events.

1028
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:01,870
I didn't have
a normal childhood,

1029
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:02,971
you know, I...

1030
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,409
I started to notice
my chemistry was off,

1031
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:10,712
like in those pre-teen years
when I had my first sort of...

1032
01:04:10,714 --> 01:04:13,415
Like psychotic break
when I was like 14.

1033
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:16,751
So I was in an institution
until I was about 19,

1034
01:04:16,753 --> 01:04:19,487
and they didn't really know
how to properly medicate then,

1035
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:22,557
so by the time I got out,
I had a split with my family,

1036
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:23,725
and um...

1037
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,929
And I got a job at security,
which was mostly older people,

1038
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:29,865
so I didn't really consort
with people my age,

1039
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:33,268
and then I just missed...
I just missed the boat.

1040
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:34,336
I just missed it.

1041
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:36,004
Um...

1042
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,807
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

1043
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:41,142
Nope.

1044
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:43,578
I...

1045
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:49,551
Have you ever seen that movie,
<i>never been kissed?</i>

1046
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,052
Yeah.

1047
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:54,556
I should have written
and directed that movie.

1048
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:57,826
It's embarrassing.

1049
01:04:57,828 --> 01:04:59,261
No, it's not embarrassing.

1050
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:00,428
It's really embarrassing.

1051
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,697
It's really weird,

1052
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:04,399
but it's not embarrassing.

1053
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:09,871
I don't know.

1054
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:14,576
Do you wanna
have your first kiss?

1055
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:20,015
Shut up.

1056
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:21,416
It doesn't have to
be a big deal.

1057
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:24,119
Really?

1058
01:05:24,121 --> 01:05:25,121
Yeah.

1059
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:26,955
You would kiss me?

1060
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:27,957
Yeah.

1061
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:31,159
Okay.

1062
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:32,161
Okay.

1063
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,064
Who makes the move?

1064
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:53,148
That was cool.

1065
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,161
You know, I'm super
excited about this idea.

1066
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:08,063
I have the climax
to the episode.

1067
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:09,497
So where are you taking me?

1068
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:11,333
Like I'm gonna tell you.

1069
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:12,834
Watch your head.

1070
01:06:12,836 --> 01:06:15,070
All good things to
those who wait, my dear.

1071
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:17,973
Come this way.

1072
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,046
Okay.

1073
01:06:25,048 --> 01:06:27,215
All right, now,
before we get started,

1074
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:28,717
I do have a surprise for you,

1075
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:30,485
but you have to close your eyes.

1076
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,687
Why would I close my eyes?

1077
01:06:32,689 --> 01:06:34,022
There's no fucking way.

1078
01:06:34,024 --> 01:06:36,324
I'm in the middle of nowhere
at night with you.

1079
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,727
That's a very good point.
Point taken,

1080
01:06:38,729 --> 01:06:40,362
but it will be worth it.

1081
01:06:40,364 --> 01:06:41,429
Trust me.

1082
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:42,530
Okay.

1083
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:45,767
All right.

1084
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:54,476
Open it.

1085
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,946
What is this?

1086
01:06:57,948 --> 01:07:01,249
It's a symbol of
my affection for you

1087
01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:04,719
and of our amazing day
we spent together.

1088
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:06,955
Sorry, there's a picture of
me and another guy in there.

1089
01:07:06,957 --> 01:07:10,825
I didn't have a chance to make
one specifically for you.

1090
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:12,327
You were a bit of a surprise.

1091
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:14,696
May I?

1092
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:15,897
Okay.

1093
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,070
Cool.

1094
01:07:22,072 --> 01:07:24,406
All tight. It's time
for part two.

1095
01:07:24,408 --> 01:07:25,507
Ready?

1096
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:26,541
Okay.

1097
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:33,281
I don't get it.

1098
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,324
Oh, shit.

1099
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:47,929
When did you dig that?

1100
01:07:47,931 --> 01:07:49,397
I dug it before you got here.

1101
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:52,133
I wasn't sure if it was
supposed to be for me

1102
01:07:52,135 --> 01:07:54,069
or for you.

1103
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:56,071
But I think I finally
figured it out.

1104
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,309
Okay.

1105
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,818
Tada!

1106
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:12,353
Nope, nope, nope.
It's yours.

1107
01:08:12,355 --> 01:08:15,623
I snuck it out of your boot
after I fell on you.

1108
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:17,692
Thought for sure
you would have noticed that.

1109
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:21,129
Are you ready

1110
01:08:21,131 --> 01:08:23,531
for the grand finale
of the episode?

1111
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:25,200
Okay.

1112
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:26,301
Okay.

1113
01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:52,260
It's all right.

1114
01:08:52,262 --> 01:08:54,629
We both stab each other
and we both crawl in the grave

1115
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,931
and we die together
like Romeo and Juliet,

1116
01:08:56,933 --> 01:09:00,001
and somebody would
find the tapes.

1117
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:01,703
And when they see it,
we'll be like,

1118
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:03,738
history together.

1119
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:08,343
Look, you're afraid.

1120
01:09:08,345 --> 01:09:10,445
Don't be afraid.
I'm not gonna stab you.

1121
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:13,515
Here. I love you too much.
Take it. Take the knife.

1122
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,483
You do it.

1123
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:19,420
Come on.

1124
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:21,356
Do it.

1125
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:24,759
Come on.

1126
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,700
Sara...

1127
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,169
Wait!

1128
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:41,509
Sara!

1129
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:43,878
Sara!

1130
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,819
Sara!

1131
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:55,290
Sara!

1132
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,225
Sara!

1133
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:06,768
Sara!

1134
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:11,386
You're in the middle of nowhere.

1135
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:15,944
Come on, Sara.

1136
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,217
I have the keys.
There's nowhere to go.

1137
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1138
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:44,539
Sara?

1139
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Your best episode...

1140
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:18,793
So...

1141
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:23,030
I don't think
I'm gonna die tonight.

1142
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:28,403
I kind of feel bad
about it. It's...

1143
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:32,507
It was my whole idea
in the first place.

1144
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:36,944
But, Sara...

1145
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,117
You did it.

1146
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:48,122
You made a great, great episode.

1147
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,492
You should be really
proud of yourself.

1148
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,932
I'm bummed you're not
gonna be here to see it.

1149
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:04,906
It's kind of ironic 'cause
I never thought I was...

1150
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:09,243
I really don't wanna kill again.

1151
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:11,712
That was real,
but then it was you,

1152
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:13,948
my muse.

1153
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:18,886
You inspired me.

1154
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:23,558
My Coppola.
