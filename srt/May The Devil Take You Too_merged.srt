1
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:03,029
Gadis, it's me Dewi.

2
00:01:03,154 --> 00:01:04,946
Dis.

3
00:01:06,696 --> 00:01:08,862
I can't help you this way.

4
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:36,029
Gadis, why don't you ever meet us?

5
00:01:37,404 --> 00:01:39,612
We need to stick together, so we don't forget.

6
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:42,571
Together we're strong. You understand, right?

7
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:46,029
But none of you ever believed me.

8
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:48,821
You said 'he' attacked you, Gadis.

9
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:52,696
I felt everything, Dewi.

10
00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:55,821
We are free from him.

11
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:57,904
A long time ago.

12
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:00,654
We're stronger than him.

13
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:09,946
Who did this to you?

14
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:17,279
Why don't you believe me?

15
00:02:23,112 --> 00:02:23,987
I don't know.

16
00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:26,237
Trust me, Dewi

17
00:02:26,737 --> 00:02:30,654
I felt him, the same way I'm feeling you right now.

18
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,571
What do you mean?

19
00:02:40,404 --> 00:02:43,737
He's dead. Remember that day, right?

20
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:54,654
He's staring at you right now. Smiling.

21
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:21,904
I'll stay here tonight.

22
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:57,487
Yes, Budi?

23
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,862
You're with her?

24
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:00,487
Yes, with Gadis.

25
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,946
Something's wrong with her.

26
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:06,487
Bruises all over her body.

27
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:09,071
Kept saying she was abused.

28
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:11,696
She said Ayub did it to her.

29
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:14,529
Ayub? She mentioned that name again?

30
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:17,904
15 years passed and she hasn't moved on-

31
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:20,362
No one can truly move on from that!

32
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:23,862
She needs a psychiatrist.

33
00:04:24,862 --> 00:04:26,904
What she needs is our support.

34
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:31,612
Understood, but she's always been different since we're
kids.

35
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:36,196
If she's acting up, it's not your responsibility

36
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:38,946
Hello, Dewi?

37
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,654
Bud, call you back.

38
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:42,904
Dewi!

39
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:26,362
Dewi.

40
00:06:42,946 --> 00:06:44,529
Dewi!

41
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:28,321
Wait!

42
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:35,529
Okay, come in.

43
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:05,029
..Alfie.

44
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:19,571
Nara.

45
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:21,696
Nara.

46
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:31,571
I miss him too.

47
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:34,987
But we have to move on.

48
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:39,696
We only have each other.

49
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:49,196
Sleep tight, okay?

50
00:09:50,196 --> 00:09:51,737
I love you.

51
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:58,279
Devil's child..

52
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

53
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:34,571
Wait! Please!

54
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:40,446
Alfie! Alfie!

55
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:43,987
Careful! Nara might get hurt.

56
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:45,529
Who are you?!

57
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:47,987
We meant no harm.

58
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:54,987
Kristi, are you okay?

59
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:06,112
Everybody's alright?

60
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:13,362
I'll go first.

61
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:14,946
I'll bring the car to the front.

62
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:16,904
Kristi, stay.

63
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:18,654
Watch for anything suspicious.

64
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:31,737
Come.

65
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:40,071
Are you guys crazy?

66
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,362
You put her in there since Jakarta?

67
00:14:42,362 --> 00:14:43,362
She could die!

68
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:45,279
She kept putting a fight.

69
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:47,612
The small one is at the front.

70
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:49,946
She's alive, right, Sis?

71
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:51,737
Marta, Kristi!

72
00:14:52,404 --> 00:14:53,237
Take the little one inside.

73
00:14:53,237 --> 00:14:53,821
Yes Sis.

74
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:54,696
You guys take her.

75
00:14:58,946 --> 00:14:59,571
Okay.

76
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:00,487
Hold her head.

77
00:15:27,904 --> 00:15:29,112
Nara!

78
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:38,196
Rise and shine.

79
00:15:42,737 --> 00:15:43,821
Where's Nara?

80
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,071
She's outside.

81
00:15:50,904 --> 00:15:51,946
What do you want?

82
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:55,571
Don't ask too much

83
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:00,904
You're in my room, right?

84
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:04,529
How's your head?

85
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:06,654
Still hurts?

86
00:16:06,737 --> 00:16:07,612
Bitch..

87
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:15,154
You like being electrocuted?

88
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:22,071
Here, want to get even?

89
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:36,446
What do you want?

90
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:38,362
Why did you take us here?

91
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:43,654
You'll find out!

92
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:50,446
What's wrong with her?

93
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:52,946
Guess she fell.

94
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:00,154
My name is Budi.

95
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,071
Alfie, I'm Jenar.

96
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:13,779
That's Leo.

97
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,987
First, let me apologize.

98
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:19,696
- If there's any other way
- One more time!

99
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,112
Where's Nara?

100
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:26,571
Calm down, Alfie.

101
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:29,404
I wasn't asking you.

102
00:17:31,654 --> 00:17:32,946
She's with the others.

103
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:35,696
She's okay. Trust me!

104
00:17:36,362 --> 00:17:37,654
What do you want from us?

105
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:39,779
We have nothing.

106
00:17:40,404 --> 00:17:41,987
That's not it.

107
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:44,946
Do you know this place?

108
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:50,071
Bahtera Orphanage.

109
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:52,404
This was once a place for orphans

110
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,571
built by a childless husband and wife.

111
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:03,946
This place was once filled with warmth.

112
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:06,404
Who were abandoned by their own birth parents.

113
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:17,071
But everything changed.

114
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:22,112
Since the wife passed away.

115
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:29,029
At that time, there were 7 kids who weren't adopted yet.

116
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:31,237
Years passed.

117
00:18:34,654 --> 00:18:36,029
They grew older.

118
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:41,612
And they were still living here.

119
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:45,946
There they realized.

120
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,404
Not all adults have the intention to keep them safe.

121
00:18:56,196 --> 00:18:57,487
Gradually.

122
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:03,362
This home turned into a terrifying place.

123
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,071
Sir!

124
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:08,821
Sir!

125
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:10,362
Sir!

126
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:12,154
Please open the door, Sir!

127
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,654
- The one person they considered
- Sir! Please, Sir!

128
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,362
- Became a figure that turn their childhood a living hell.
- Sir! Please, Sir!

129
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:23,862
Anyone dared to disobey were locked in the kitchen.

130
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:30,529
Without food. Without water. Without lights.

131
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:32,862
In total silence.

132
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:36,071
Even for days.

133
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,696
Alfie, do you know how it feels going through a nightmare.

134
00:19:44,696 --> 00:19:46,529
That never ends?

135
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:52,404
I know how it feels to wake up from a nightmare.

136
00:19:53,946 --> 00:19:58,654
And realize that real life is worse.

137
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:06,779
Why don't you just cut to the chase.

138
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:10,237
After this place was closed down.

139
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,696
The children were separated to live in different orphanages.

140
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,237
Living their own lives.

141
00:20:25,196 --> 00:20:28,237
But promised to never forget each other.

142
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:46,821
So, the Police didn't know all of you killed the foster
father?

143
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:48,987
Where was the Police when we were locked up?

144
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:50,779
- Tortured?
- Leo!

145
00:20:50,987 --> 00:20:52,612
- Forced to naked? Forced to
- Leo!

146
00:20:52,946 --> 00:20:53,946
Don't worry.

147
00:20:55,529 --> 00:21:00,529
You're facing with someone who burnt her own step sister.

148
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:16,196
Let's go downstairs.

149
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,029
Bud? Cheeky bastard!

150
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:23,446
I'm okay. It's okay!

151
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:25,529
That's for this morning.

152
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,196
From your closet.

153
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:34,446
Are you okay?

154
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

155
00:23:37,112 --> 00:23:38,446
She's taking too long.

156
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:40,112
Find her would you?

157
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:41,487
There she is.

158
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,612
Its all neatly cut.

159
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:48,654
Here, eat.

160
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:53,321
Nara! Nara!

161
00:23:53,862 --> 00:23:55,071
Are you okay?

162
00:23:56,362 --> 00:23:57,029
I'm okay.

163
00:23:57,112 --> 00:23:57,862
Alfie.

164
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:00,196
Sit down.

165
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:10,862
Alfie.

166
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:14,654
This is Gadis. Marta. And Kristi.

167
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,737
Again, I apologize.

168
00:24:17,737 --> 00:24:19,654
We mean no harm to both of you.

169
00:24:22,654 --> 00:24:23,529
We're desperate

170
00:24:23,987 --> 00:24:25,029
What do you mean?

171
00:24:25,737 --> 00:24:26,737
We believe.

172
00:24:27,696 --> 00:24:29,029
Our foster father, Mister Ayub,

173
00:24:30,446 --> 00:24:31,821
Has returned..for vengeance.

174
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:33,279
Returned from?

175
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:34,946
Death.

176
00:24:35,612 --> 00:24:38,196
Gadis encountered him, she was the first to be attacked.

177
00:24:38,862 --> 00:24:41,196
We did'nt believe her. Until

178
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:43,571
Until he killed Dewi.

179
00:24:43,946 --> 00:24:45,779
Not 100 % proven, though.

180
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:48,321
I saw it with my own eyes.

181
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,737
Dewi was killed by..

182
00:24:51,071 --> 00:24:52,029
Something.

183
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:54,696
Let's get things straight.

184
00:24:54,904 --> 00:24:57,571
There was no other witness, you were alone with Dewi.

185
00:24:58,737 --> 00:24:59,987
What did you say?

186
00:25:01,362 --> 00:25:03,404
Have you seen what's done to her body?

187
00:25:04,612 --> 00:25:06,862
None of you ever trusted me.

188
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:08,737
And look what happens.

189
00:25:09,654 --> 00:25:11,904
- Because you've always been strange
- Kristi!

190
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:14,696
If you canÃ•t be supportive then leave.

191
00:25:18,987 --> 00:25:21,696
Just because I doubt, doesn't mean I don't grieve.

192
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:31,737
Enough. What do you all want?

193
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:34,821
Nara and I just want to go home.

194
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:40,071
You testified to the Police that your father dealt with
witchcraft

195
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:43,279
And you witnessed it with yourself.

196
00:25:44,196 --> 00:25:47,029
There must be a reason why Ayub's able to exist here.

197
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,029
Gadis.

198
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:32,071
Sorry, Alfie.

199
00:26:33,946 --> 00:26:35,196
These must be unpleasantly familiar.

200
00:26:37,571 --> 00:26:38,487
Have a drink.

201
00:26:48,362 --> 00:26:49,904
Where did that Book come from?

202
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,696
I was a kid then, but I remember..

203
00:26:56,112 --> 00:26:57,862
A woman came over.

204
00:26:58,654 --> 00:27:00,196
She gave the Bible to Ayub.

205
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:02,362
A woman?

206
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:06,904
I never found out who she was.

207
00:27:09,321 --> 00:27:10,737
As Jenar said.

208
00:27:12,154 --> 00:27:13,862
Every day was torment for us.

209
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:23,779
I don't know why Ayub gets himself entangled with these
things.

210
00:27:24,946 --> 00:27:26,446
In my father's case

211
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:28,571
..Greed.

212
00:27:29,737 --> 00:27:31,196
But Ayub,

213
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:33,821
Perhaps something to do with his late wife?

214
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,154
Would that kind of ritual brings his wife back?

215
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,154
Bud, come in. How is she?

216
00:27:44,987 --> 00:27:46,654
Everything is okay. Over.

217
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:47,737
Okay.

218
00:27:49,154 --> 00:27:50,654
Cellphone's useless around here.

219
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:53,612
Let's go inside.

220
00:27:54,612 --> 00:27:55,362
Wait!

221
00:27:56,404 --> 00:27:58,071
I need to know what you want from me?

222
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:03,112
After Dewi's death.

223
00:28:05,196 --> 00:28:06,737
Marta researched the Bible..

224
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:09,071
And she believes,

225
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:11,737
Dewi's death is just the beginning.

226
00:28:13,904 --> 00:28:16,571
That something embeds in all of us after we killed Ayub.

227
00:28:20,987 --> 00:28:21,654
What is it?

228
00:28:25,112 --> 00:28:25,904
A curse.

229
00:28:47,321 --> 00:28:49,654
Back then, this room terrifies us the most.

230
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,362
We always felt there's something down there.

231
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:55,404
Ready to come out.

232
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,946
None of you ever go down there?

233
00:29:21,904 --> 00:29:23,071
Only Ayub did.

234
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:31,154
Leo, help me out.

235
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:40,487
Keep pushing.

236
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:47,779
Let's go.

237
00:29:50,946 --> 00:29:51,821
I'm not going.

238
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:55,654
Thought you don't believe in this.

239
00:29:55,946 --> 00:29:56,696
Oh, you're brave huh?

240
00:29:58,654 --> 00:30:00,862
Don't want to know what he did down there.

241
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:05,237
Then, take Nara with you?

242
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,529
Nara, stay with Kristi, okay?

243
00:30:19,696 --> 00:30:20,696
Marta.

244
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:26,154
I need you down there.

245
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:33,196
I'll go first.

246
00:30:49,862 --> 00:30:50,779
Jenar.

247
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:18,946
Alfie, you're truly the one we've been looking for.

248
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:23,904
- Let's speed things up.
- Where do we start?

249
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,696
We start from where he ends.

250
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:37,862
There's an ancient belief, in the occult world..

251
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:41,237
Its basic principle, that all humans who worship Demons.

252
00:31:41,237 --> 00:31:44,904
Are obliged to surrender their souls to their Demonic
deities.

253
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,446
There are certain demons that demand

254
00:31:49,446 --> 00:31:50,529
sacrificial offerings.

255
00:31:51,987 --> 00:31:54,821
These sacrificials is one's proof of ultimate servitude.

256
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:56,779
What is this figure?

257
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,446
An ancient demon.

258
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:02,154
Known as the figure of enlightenment and immortality.

259
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:04,571
It's name is

260
00:32:04,946 --> 00:32:06,071
MOLOCH

261
00:32:10,112 --> 00:32:12,737
We believe Ayub's plan was to sacrifice all of us.

262
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:15,696
- But before it could happened
- Alfie.

263
00:32:16,237 --> 00:32:19,987
You're able to feel it right?

264
00:32:21,154 --> 00:32:22,821
To see and sense the unseen?

265
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,946
Alfie, the curse that a demon worshipper cast on us

266
00:32:29,946 --> 00:32:31,362
will never disappear.

267
00:32:32,071 --> 00:32:34,654
Unless revoked by human who survived

268
00:32:34,654 --> 00:32:36,071
from the Devil himself.

269
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:41,821
Alfie, if you can read this 'spell', you can terminate the
curse.

270
00:32:43,321 --> 00:32:44,154
I don't understand this.

271
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:55,196
It's alright, Aflie.

272
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:22,946
What are you kids doing?

273
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:25,821
Little pests! Give me the stairs!

274
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:43,279
Master will never let none of you go.

275
00:35:24,196 --> 00:35:28,362
- Alfie! Alfie!
- Alfie!

276
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:35,862
- Now what?
- Marta, what happened?"

277
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:40,696
- Alfie! Alfie!
- Alfie!

278
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:06,654
It's freezing.

279
00:36:13,362 --> 00:36:14,571
What are you looking at?

280
00:36:26,029 --> 00:36:27,029
Hello, Budi?

281
00:36:28,529 --> 00:36:29,196
Leo?

282
00:36:30,446 --> 00:36:31,071
Hello?

283
00:36:52,487 --> 00:36:53,446
Hello?

284
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,237
Kristi?

285
00:36:55,904 --> 00:37:00,571
Kristi belongs to me now, Leo.

286
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:27,904
Budi, look out!

287
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:17,237
Jenar..

288
00:39:28,071 --> 00:39:29,071
Look!

289
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:49,654
What is it now?

290
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,987
Jenar.

291
00:40:07,987 --> 00:40:09,612
What happens to Jenar, Alfie?!

292
00:40:09,612 --> 00:40:11,612
Alfie, what happens to her?!

293
00:40:12,904 --> 00:40:14,987
Alfie! What do you see?

294
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:16,904
Jenar.

295
00:40:24,196 --> 00:40:25,154
Jenar!

296
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:31,821
Alfie.

297
00:40:56,112 --> 00:40:57,446
Jenar!

298
00:41:03,571 --> 00:41:04,654
Jenar!

299
00:41:25,196 --> 00:41:26,821
- Budi, Leo?
- Big sis.."

300
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:28,196
Hello?

301
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,237
- Big sis!
- What the hell?

302
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:32,821
Listen, big sis..

303
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,654
- Sis
- Wait here.

304
00:42:16,737 --> 00:42:17,987
Close the door!

305
00:43:02,321 --> 00:43:04,654
Budi, hurry! Hurry up!

306
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Budi!

307
00:43:16,904 --> 00:43:19,696
Nara, run!

308
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

309
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:31,362
Alfie!

310
00:45:32,737 --> 00:45:34,112
Budi!

311
00:45:34,571 --> 00:45:36,071
Leo, move away!

312
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

313
00:47:51,612 --> 00:47:53,654
Come here, you little shit!

314
00:47:54,112 --> 00:47:55,237
Nara!

315
00:47:55,362 --> 00:47:56,112
Sis?

316
00:48:00,154 --> 00:48:03,237
Alfie, your father sends his regards.

317
00:48:03,321 --> 00:48:04,737
- From hell!
- What did you say?

318
00:48:06,112 --> 00:48:07,237
What the fuck did you say?

319
00:48:07,362 --> 00:48:10,821
- Do it Alfie, Do it!
- What did you say?

320
00:48:38,071 --> 00:48:40,779
Alfie.

321
00:48:49,987 --> 00:48:51,612
Who are you?

322
00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:57,446
He's still waiting for you, Alfie.

323
00:49:00,279 --> 00:49:05,196
Got away once, be damned..

324
00:49:05,737 --> 00:49:08,154
Alfie condemned!

325
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:09,696
No!

326
00:49:54,029 --> 00:49:55,154
She was not your friend anymore.

327
00:49:55,279 --> 00:49:56,904
She was like my own sister!

328
00:49:57,612 --> 00:50:00,487
Should've made sure before you murdered her!

329
00:50:01,821 --> 00:50:03,529
I've known Kristi all my life!

330
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:05,654
Then why didn't you stop her?!

331
00:50:05,696 --> 00:50:07,237
Show some respect!

332
00:50:08,612 --> 00:50:09,487
Please!

333
00:50:20,446 --> 00:50:21,946
You know, Nara?

334
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:25,571
They're just like my own siblings.

335
00:50:27,779 --> 00:50:29,904
Even though, they often disregard me.

336
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:32,154
I know, big sis.

337
00:50:34,362 --> 00:50:40,862
I lost my siblings too. My mother.

338
00:50:42,154 --> 00:50:43,696
My Father

339
00:50:44,946 --> 00:50:47,446
You're stronger than me. Nara, I'm sorry.

340
00:50:48,862 --> 00:50:51,237
And forgive me for getting you involved.

341
00:50:55,904 --> 00:50:58,446
No one should go down there again.

342
00:50:59,529 --> 00:51:01,779
Best if you seal that door shut.

343
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:03,654
Now!

344
00:51:04,779 --> 00:51:05,862
Shit!

345
00:51:07,029 --> 00:51:08,612
This is a fucking mess.

346
00:51:09,029 --> 00:51:11,987
Once everything's over, we'll give them a proper funeral.

347
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,196
Help me Leo.

348
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:39,237
You!

349
00:51:39,987 --> 00:51:42,196
You told me to recite that specific spell!

350
00:51:43,154 --> 00:51:45,612
You said that spell could revoke Ayub's curse.

351
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:47,112
But look now!

352
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,362
It's true. It can revoke the curse, Alfie.

353
00:51:49,487 --> 00:51:52,029
If I was the only who could read the verse,

354
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:54,404
how would you know which page to read?

355
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:55,987
How?!

356
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:59,029
Why would I lie? I researched everything and I...

357
00:51:59,071 --> 00:52:02,029
It means either you're wrong or you're lying

358
00:52:02,237 --> 00:52:03,237
Alfie!
- You, shit!

359
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:04,404
You piece of shit!

360
00:52:06,196 --> 00:52:08,112
Marta has tried her best!

361
00:52:08,821 --> 00:52:10,029
I trust her.

362
00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:11,154
Yes.

363
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:12,654
You trusted her,

364
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:14,862
Now two of you are dead!

365
00:52:16,321 --> 00:52:17,529
Why should I trust her?

366
00:52:17,987 --> 00:52:18,612
Why?!

367
00:52:18,779 --> 00:52:20,112
She trusts you, Alfie.

368
00:52:21,446 --> 00:52:22,237
Let me go!

369
00:52:25,362 --> 00:52:26,779
Nara, let's go!

370
00:52:35,196 --> 00:52:35,946
Alfie!

371
00:52:40,612 --> 00:52:42,279
We're leaving now!

372
00:52:42,362 --> 00:52:43,987
But you have to help us, Alfie

373
00:52:44,071 --> 00:52:45,154
What else huh?

374
00:52:46,321 --> 00:52:48,321
I've done everything you asked me for.

375
00:52:49,071 --> 00:52:49,654
Okay,

376
00:52:49,987 --> 00:52:51,237
You're right, you did.

377
00:52:51,904 --> 00:52:53,321
Budi, are you for real?

378
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:56,446
This is our problem, we have to figure it out.

379
00:52:57,529 --> 00:53:00,029
- I'll take you to the nearest train station.
- Alright

380
00:53:03,737 --> 00:53:05,029
We're getting out of here.

381
00:53:05,612 --> 00:53:06,404
Go inside.

382
00:53:08,779 --> 00:53:09,779
Hurry!

383
00:53:30,112 --> 00:53:31,154
Its not usually like this.

384
00:53:32,112 --> 00:53:34,862
Are you serious? You promised.

385
00:53:35,862 --> 00:53:36,862
Okay, hold on.

386
00:54:11,696 --> 00:54:12,487
Sis?

387
00:54:13,362 --> 00:54:14,154
What's wrong?

388
00:54:19,071 --> 00:54:21,487
We weren't supposed to be here.

389
00:54:23,362 --> 00:54:26,321
Calm down, Alfie, take it slow.

390
00:54:32,487 --> 00:54:37,112
Relax, we're not going anywhere.

391
00:54:47,404 --> 00:54:48,821
What did you say, Nara?

392
00:54:50,279 --> 00:54:53,696
Devil's chid.

393
00:55:08,946 --> 00:55:10,487
What's wrong, Alfie?

394
00:55:12,737 --> 00:55:15,821
Nothing, Nothing.

395
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

396
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:32,862
Nara?

397
00:55:33,612 --> 00:55:35,446
Budi?

398
00:55:42,571 --> 00:55:43,571
Nara?

399
00:56:08,612 --> 00:56:10,654
Alfie..

400
00:56:50,237 --> 00:56:56,029
Devil's child.

401
00:57:07,487 --> 00:57:08,946
Lesmana?

402
00:57:10,779 --> 00:57:12,362
Since when?

403
00:57:17,946 --> 00:57:19,696
Be careful, Alfie.

404
00:57:20,862 --> 00:57:24,571
It still wants you.

405
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:28,654
- Who?
- You know its name.

406
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,071
No!

407
00:57:30,696 --> 00:57:33,154
All these happened to Nara and I because of you!

408
00:57:33,737 --> 00:57:35,821
This is all your fault, Lesmana!

409
00:57:36,071 --> 00:57:42,946
I've tried my best to stop it..

410
00:57:43,029 --> 00:57:45,196
But it didn't work.

411
00:57:49,779 --> 00:57:53,821
It demands your soul, Alfie

412
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:57,946
He dragged you into this place..

413
00:57:59,196 --> 00:58:01,446
Leave! Alfie, leave this place!

414
00:58:01,487 --> 00:58:03,571
- No
- Leave!

415
00:58:24,321 --> 00:58:25,321
Alfie, are you okay?

416
00:58:31,237 --> 00:58:33,487
After we lost everything.

417
00:58:34,821 --> 00:58:37,446
Nobody really believed in us.

418
00:58:40,779 --> 00:58:45,821
Police. Psychologist. Whatever that is.

419
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:51,237
I began to believe in nothing.

420
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:56,279
Not knowing what's real and what's not.

421
00:58:57,654 --> 00:59:00,029
I'm afraid I'm losing it, Budi.

422
00:59:03,487 --> 00:59:09,696
But twhat's truly scary is realizing..

423
00:59:11,196 --> 00:59:14,196
That this madness is actually real.

424
00:59:19,071 --> 00:59:21,237
Alfie! Your arm.

425
00:59:27,362 --> 00:59:29,237
How did I end up back here?

426
00:59:29,821 --> 00:59:32,196
You passed out in the car.

427
00:59:47,029 --> 00:59:49,446
This was ages ago. I failed..obviously.

428
00:59:53,112 --> 00:59:55,321
When Gadis hit a rough patch.

429
00:59:56,737 --> 00:59:58,946
I told her to see a psychiatrist.

430
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:01,487
I'm no better than the Police.

431
01:00:02,196 --> 01:00:04,696
Or the psychologist who didn't believe you.

432
01:00:05,446 --> 01:00:08,279
Well, I'm crazier than all of you.

433
01:00:13,196 --> 01:00:14,571
Leo's a drunk.

434
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,404
Jenar and Kristi are mostly shut off.

435
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:21,946
Marta's too consumed within her own walls.

436
01:00:22,987 --> 01:00:25,362
Myself? I'm no catch.

437
01:00:27,112 --> 01:00:28,446
We never had normal.

438
01:00:31,154 --> 01:00:32,529
It's not your fault.

439
01:00:35,487 --> 01:00:36,779
I saw it myself.

440
01:00:40,279 --> 01:00:41,279
Bud..

441
01:00:42,279 --> 01:00:44,654
Ayub will never let you go.

442
01:00:51,404 --> 01:00:54,237
A demon who demands sacrificial children.

443
01:01:00,404 --> 01:01:02,279
Why now though?

444
01:01:05,237 --> 01:01:07,071
Alfie, when I tried to fix the car,

445
01:01:07,446 --> 01:01:09,196
The wires were slashed.

446
01:01:10,321 --> 01:01:12,654
Is it possible that these 'things' do that?

447
01:01:13,279 --> 01:01:14,404
I don't know.

448
01:01:15,237 --> 01:01:17,112
Until we know what we're dealing with,

449
01:01:18,112 --> 01:01:20,321
I need to see that Black Bible now.

450
01:01:25,196 --> 01:01:26,071
Leo,

451
01:01:26,571 --> 01:01:28,279
can you come over here with the rest?

452
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:30,529
Bring the Bible.

453
01:01:35,112 --> 01:01:38,112
Leo. About the car, I've nothing to do with it.

454
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:40,987
Best for you not to say anything right now.

455
01:01:42,279 --> 01:01:44,737
- Okay?
- But you trust me, right?

456
01:02:07,446 --> 01:02:08,404
Marta.

457
01:02:09,737 --> 01:02:11,904
You know about this more than me.

458
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,279
I need your help.

459
01:02:14,946 --> 01:02:15,904
Please!

460
01:02:25,112 --> 01:02:26,029
Where's Gadis?

461
01:02:29,862 --> 01:02:30,862
She was with us.

462
01:02:33,112 --> 01:02:34,779
Best we stick together from now.

463
01:02:50,071 --> 01:02:51,696
Always poor old me..

464
01:02:53,362 --> 01:02:54,196
Dis..

465
01:02:56,404 --> 01:02:57,487
Gadis.

466
01:03:06,737 --> 01:03:08,029
Are these spells?

467
01:03:08,487 --> 01:03:09,571
More than that, Alfie.

468
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:11,487
From what I've researched,

469
01:03:11,779 --> 01:03:14,237
This Bible has been used by a number of people.

470
01:03:14,987 --> 01:03:17,237
To summon things.

471
01:03:19,612 --> 01:03:22,279
Things beyond comprehension of logic.

472
01:03:24,154 --> 01:03:28,029
Marta, you should not be messing with these.

473
01:03:31,196 --> 01:03:32,029
Dis,

474
01:03:33,821 --> 01:03:34,737
Gadis.

475
01:03:36,071 --> 01:03:37,237
I'm tired!

476
01:03:49,071 --> 01:03:51,487
Shit, what a mess.

477
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:54,154
Should've been a homeless kid instead.

478
01:04:18,112 --> 01:04:19,321
What's wrong, Alfie?

479
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:45,987
What is this?

480
01:04:49,446 --> 01:04:52,862
Fuck, you fuckin' weirdo.

481
01:04:54,737 --> 01:04:56,154
Who's a weirdo?

482
01:05:00,279 --> 01:05:01,112
Gadis!

483
01:05:03,279 --> 01:05:05,321
Gadis!

484
01:05:05,654 --> 01:05:06,987
Open the door!

485
01:05:09,862 --> 01:05:14,237
Leo, always putting up a fight..

486
01:05:14,529 --> 01:05:16,487
Why are you doing this?

487
01:05:18,321 --> 01:05:20,654
Father Ayub says you're punished, Leo.

488
01:05:23,779 --> 01:05:24,904
What do you mean?

489
01:05:25,779 --> 01:05:27,779
Just like when we were kids.

490
01:05:31,071 --> 01:05:32,029
Let's see now.

491
01:05:32,571 --> 01:05:34,029
How long will you last?

492
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,321
Let me out of here Gadis!

493
01:05:41,862 --> 01:05:43,571
Gadis!

494
01:05:43,779 --> 01:05:44,696
Budi!

495
01:05:51,279 --> 01:05:53,612
This is Gadis right? Sitting on Ayub's lap.

496
01:05:54,571 --> 01:05:56,112
It is..

497
01:05:56,529 --> 01:05:59,862
Do you know what Stockholm Syndrome means?

498
01:06:04,529 --> 01:06:05,779
Look at their hands.

499
01:06:21,154 --> 01:06:22,862
Sir!

500
01:06:23,571 --> 01:06:25,821
Open the door, Sir!

501
01:06:27,112 --> 01:06:28,362
Sir Ayub!

502
01:06:34,196 --> 01:06:36,321
We'll die here.

503
01:06:36,737 --> 01:06:37,987
It can't be..

504
01:06:38,529 --> 01:06:40,571
Sir Ayub will never let us out.

505
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,987
No! Impossible!

506
01:06:56,821 --> 01:06:59,237
Bud!? Budi?!

507
01:07:00,821 --> 01:07:01,821
Bud?

508
01:07:02,237 --> 01:07:03,237
Son of a bitch!

509
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:28,112
Marta!

510
01:09:29,362 --> 01:09:31,529
That spell has ressurected Ayub.

511
01:09:31,987 --> 01:09:34,279
- Am I right?!
- Alfie!

512
01:09:34,321 --> 01:09:36,279
- Marta, answer me!
- Alfie

513
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,362
Leo? Leo?

514
01:10:01,529 --> 01:10:06,154
Leo is with me, Budi. You'll follow him soon..

515
01:10:15,987 --> 01:10:17,862
Budi, help me. Come on!

516
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:21,612
Gadis!

517
01:10:22,779 --> 01:10:24,321
Gadis, open the door!

518
01:10:27,154 --> 01:10:28,529
Gadis!

519
01:10:48,487 --> 01:10:50,446
Oh, my father.

520
01:10:51,987 --> 01:10:53,612
I am ready.

521
01:10:54,821 --> 01:10:56,904
To be in your servitude

522
01:10:57,196 --> 01:11:01,279
As you are to 'him'.

523
01:11:04,571 --> 01:11:08,196
I am ready, Father.

524
01:11:24,696 --> 01:11:27,821
I am ready.

525
01:11:45,696 --> 01:11:48,029
My child.

526
01:11:49,987 --> 01:11:52,612
I am ready, Father.

527
01:11:58,821 --> 01:12:00,529
I am ready, Father.

528
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:04,362
I am ready! I am ready, Father.

529
01:12:19,904 --> 01:12:20,821
Gadis?

530
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:22,071
Gadis.

531
01:12:23,821 --> 01:12:24,612
Budi!

532
01:12:28,946 --> 01:12:30,571
Gadis, what are you doing?

533
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,529
Budi, don't!

534
01:12:33,321 --> 01:12:35,487
You'll be joining Leo, Budi.

535
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:39,571
All shall be together again.

536
01:12:39,612 --> 01:12:41,446
What have you done to Leo, Gadis?

537
01:12:42,946 --> 01:12:44,362
Why?

538
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:47,696
- You're our sister
- Shut up, Budi.

539
01:12:49,154 --> 01:12:50,446
You're all blind.

540
01:12:51,529 --> 01:12:53,071
Blind towards his greatness.

541
01:12:53,654 --> 01:12:55,487
What awaits us beyond these..

542
01:12:57,154 --> 01:12:58,779
You never believed it, right?

543
01:13:00,154 --> 01:13:02,987
Father loved all of us.

544
01:13:03,362 --> 01:13:07,362
- You're insane!
- He begs Moloch so we can be unified.

545
01:13:07,862 --> 01:13:08,987
Forever.

546
01:13:09,404 --> 01:13:11,029
Yet, you all killed Father.

547
01:13:11,737 --> 01:13:13,362
We all loved you!

548
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:17,071
Dewi died for you!

549
01:13:18,404 --> 01:13:19,612
Dewi..

550
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,987
I'm staying over tonight.

551
01:13:24,404 --> 01:13:28,112
She always wanted to be the hero.

552
01:13:31,821 --> 01:13:34,946
After studying the spells over and over again.

553
01:13:35,571 --> 01:13:38,487
I was finally able to summon Father.

554
01:13:39,154 --> 01:13:42,237
Even if only for a moment.

555
01:13:42,279 --> 01:13:43,737
Father Ayub cares for me

556
01:13:44,196 --> 01:13:46,404
He showed Dewi,

557
01:13:48,321 --> 01:13:51,071
her soul belongs to him.

558
01:13:54,404 --> 01:13:58,321
But to permanently resurrect Ayub,

559
01:13:58,696 --> 01:14:02,612
she needed someone who has ties with something even
stronger.

560
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:05,237
And that person is me.

561
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:06,112
Right?

562
01:14:15,946 --> 01:14:17,362
Correct, Alfie.

563
01:14:18,612 --> 01:14:20,696
This was all destined.

564
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:25,321
You know how fortunate you are?

565
01:14:27,112 --> 01:14:29,654
To be chosen by the great one.

566
01:14:31,487 --> 01:14:32,362
Gadis!

567
01:14:43,362 --> 01:14:46,529
On your knees Budi. Now!

568
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:49,446
Before it's too late for you.

569
01:14:49,779 --> 01:14:51,446
To hell with you and Ayub!

570
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,529
Fuck your spells!

571
01:15:05,362 --> 01:15:07,362
Budi!

572
01:15:08,571 --> 01:15:10,612
- Budi!
- Gadis!

573
01:15:14,321 --> 01:15:15,112
Look!

574
01:15:19,987 --> 01:15:20,987
Budi!

575
01:15:23,654 --> 01:15:24,821
Gadis, stop!

576
01:15:30,737 --> 01:15:31,404
Gadis!

577
01:15:38,321 --> 01:15:39,321
Budi!

578
01:15:43,779 --> 01:15:44,487
Budi?

579
01:16:07,404 --> 01:16:08,571
You bitch!

580
01:16:09,112 --> 01:16:10,779
Fucking deranged bitch!

581
01:16:13,654 --> 01:16:15,696
Just so you know..

582
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:18,946
I survived something much stronger than Ayub.

583
01:16:20,987 --> 01:16:22,779
Your spells are useless against me.

584
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:33,446
Alfie, watch out!

585
01:16:45,446 --> 01:16:47,696
Nara, you hurry run! Run!

586
01:16:50,529 --> 01:16:52,237
That child belongs to Father Ayub.

587
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:54,529
Enough, I want all these to be over. Please!

588
01:16:54,612 --> 01:16:55,487
Marta!

589
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,321
You lied to me, Gadis.

590
01:16:58,321 --> 01:17:00,987
You said this will make our lives happier.

591
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:02,654
I'm happy, am I not?

592
01:17:04,279 --> 01:17:07,404
Father Ayub opened the way for both of us.

593
01:17:07,987 --> 01:17:10,029
You remember, right?

594
01:17:10,362 --> 01:17:11,904
Let's go upstairs.

595
01:17:30,821 --> 01:17:31,946
Marta!

596
01:17:32,362 --> 01:17:34,154
Marta, don't listen to her!

597
01:17:34,904 --> 01:17:35,904
Marta!

598
01:17:57,946 --> 01:17:59,154
Marta!

599
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:09,571
Remember?

600
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:14,237
How I loved brushing your hair.

601
01:18:18,321 --> 01:18:20,071
After all these,

602
01:18:21,946 --> 01:18:23,987
we'll be together again.

603
01:18:25,696 --> 01:18:29,862
Yes, we'll be together in hell.

604
01:18:49,112 --> 01:18:50,946
If you truly survived the devil,

605
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:53,279
this should be nothing for you, Alfie

606
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:06,154
Marta! Snap out of it!

607
01:19:20,404 --> 01:19:23,946
- Marta!
- I'm Sorry.

608
01:19:28,946 --> 01:19:37,696
Use this Bible. To stop Gadis. Stop Ayub.

609
01:19:38,029 --> 01:19:39,904
But I don't know how.

610
01:19:52,862 --> 01:19:54,362
You're chosen, Alfie.

611
01:19:55,904 --> 01:20:01,821
Find the symbols. Read the spells.

612
01:20:08,029 --> 01:20:10,654
Marta! Marta!

613
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hello, Nara.

614
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:03,487
I'm sorry.

615
01:21:11,446 --> 01:21:13,571
Nara.

616
01:21:18,904 --> 01:21:22,279
You're a feisty one eh, Nara?

617
01:23:02,404 --> 01:23:06,279
Get up, Budi!

618
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:08,321
Hurry! Come on, hurry!

619
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:14,446
Marta!

620
01:23:17,904 --> 01:23:21,612
We have to get out of here. Now!

621
01:23:32,779 --> 01:23:33,946
Careful!

622
01:23:39,696 --> 01:23:41,946
Don't move.

623
01:23:43,696 --> 01:23:45,237
Its all over.

624
01:23:45,862 --> 01:23:47,696
My friends, they're all dead.

625
01:23:47,821 --> 01:23:49,696
Yet you're still here, alive!

626
01:23:50,529 --> 01:23:52,571
Trust me, Budi!

627
01:23:52,696 --> 01:23:53,696
Trust me!

628
01:23:54,487 --> 01:24:00,279
I have to find Nara. You fix the car, okay?

629
01:24:06,237 --> 01:24:07,571
Please..don't die!

630
01:24:08,737 --> 01:24:10,821
- Please!
- I will try.

631
01:24:57,029 --> 01:24:59,821
Help me, Alfie!

632
01:24:59,987 --> 01:25:00,946
Nara?

633
01:25:04,071 --> 01:25:05,029
Nara?

634
01:25:36,946 --> 01:25:37,821
Moloch..

635
01:25:49,446 --> 01:25:53,529
You're in my world now, Alfie.

636
01:26:45,112 --> 01:26:46,071
Nara?

637
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:13,737
This is not real.

638
01:27:15,821 --> 01:27:16,904
Alfie!

639
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Leo?
This is a dream, right?!

640
01:27:24,487 --> 01:27:25,362
Alfie!

641
01:27:25,821 --> 01:27:27,529
A dream, right?!

642
01:27:27,904 --> 01:27:28,946
Alfie!

643
01:27:48,112 --> 01:27:49,446
Kristi?

644
01:27:51,987 --> 01:27:53,279
Jenar?

645
01:27:54,071 --> 01:27:57,987
Did you see a girl..your age?

646
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:05,237
Alfie!

647
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:06,404
Nara?

648
01:28:06,529 --> 01:28:07,987
Get out of there!

649
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

650
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:04,612
- Nara?
- Alfie, I'm sorry.

651
01:29:04,696 --> 01:29:06,321
You didn't do anything wrong.

652
01:29:07,737 --> 01:29:08,946
Marta, she..

653
01:29:09,779 --> 01:29:12,029
Marta wants you to be save.

654
01:29:12,904 --> 01:29:13,696
Alfie!

655
01:29:20,487 --> 01:29:22,237
We have to go now. Hurry!

656
01:29:22,237 --> 01:29:23,904
Go! Hurry!

657
01:29:28,404 --> 01:29:29,446
Let's go, Nara!

658
01:29:30,196 --> 01:29:31,071
Alfie!

659
01:29:32,737 --> 01:29:33,987
Alfie!

660
01:30:02,987 --> 01:30:04,904
Nara!

661
01:30:05,446 --> 01:30:08,654
- Nara! You go. Go!
- Let's go, Alfie!

662
01:30:12,196 --> 01:30:13,612
Alfie!

663
01:30:15,237 --> 01:30:17,237
You belong to him now..

664
01:30:18,529 --> 01:30:21,987
Ayub! I'm not afraid of you!

665
01:30:28,612 --> 01:30:29,487
Gadis..

666
01:30:44,487 --> 01:30:46,862
This won't work, Alfie.

667
01:30:48,487 --> 01:30:51,987
If you don't know how to use it.

668
01:30:52,946 --> 01:30:59,487
Still, you're the perfect offering for Father.

669
01:31:53,487 --> 01:31:54,821
Alfie! Get up!

670
01:31:55,071 --> 01:31:56,237
Nara?

671
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:08,696
Alfie, you naive silly girl.

672
01:32:11,071 --> 01:32:14,404
I can possess anyone!

673
01:32:15,446 --> 01:32:16,446
Please..one last time..

674
01:32:16,487 --> 01:32:20,321
Shatter you bones. Shred your flesh.

675
01:32:21,029 --> 01:32:24,362
On my signal, you run straight to the ladder.

676
01:32:24,404 --> 01:32:25,904
But we have to stick together.

677
01:32:25,946 --> 01:32:29,404
Nara, you need to trust me, please!

678
01:32:31,904 --> 01:32:36,029
Once I separate your soul from your flesh,

679
01:32:36,654 --> 01:32:40,362
You'll be the ultimate offering for him.

680
01:32:43,821 --> 01:32:47,904
Then, we can be forever together, Alfie.

681
01:32:51,196 --> 01:32:54,071
Just like sisters..

682
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:09,904
Gadis!

683
01:33:52,779 --> 01:33:56,279
Satani Levitas, you fuckin ghoul!

684
01:34:35,571 --> 01:34:36,862
Alfie!

685
01:34:40,612 --> 01:34:41,987
Alfie, hurry!

686
01:34:50,779 --> 01:34:52,112
Alfie!

687
01:34:57,362 --> 01:34:59,862
It's all over, Alfie.

688
01:35:06,154 --> 01:35:08,321
Alfie, move away!

689
01:35:20,529 --> 01:35:22,779
Budi! Budi!

690
01:35:29,321 --> 01:35:30,821
You both okay?

691
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:45,446
Budi, don't!

692
01:36:12,779 --> 01:36:14,071
Father!

693
01:36:14,904 --> 01:36:18,112
Father don't leave me, please.

694
01:36:39,821 --> 01:36:41,237
- Gadis?
- Don't!

695
01:37:17,779 --> 01:37:20,487
Alfie, move!

696
01:37:27,862 --> 01:37:28,737
Sister!

697
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:30,029
Nara!

698
01:37:32,237 --> 01:37:35,196
Ayub, over here! Bastard!

699
01:37:35,946 --> 01:37:37,237
Insolent!

700
01:37:51,654 --> 01:37:55,154
Alfie? Are you okay?

701
01:38:01,946 --> 01:38:05,946
We survived the devil. Remember, Nara?

702
01:38:06,446 --> 01:38:07,279
Alfie!

703
01:38:33,029 --> 01:38:37,321
Alfie, don't! No!

704
01:38:40,779 --> 01:38:43,612
- Alfie, don't!
- I love you, Nara.

705
01:38:43,612 --> 01:38:44,904
Alfie, don't!

706
01:39:13,696 --> 01:39:19,237
Alfie, wake up! Please wake up!

707
01:40:11,779 --> 01:40:14,737
Child, do you know where you are?

708
01:40:14,779 --> 01:40:17,987
You.. You're Moloch?

709
01:40:18,071 --> 01:40:22,821
Do you know where you are?

710
01:40:22,904 --> 01:40:24,237
What is this?

711
01:40:24,737 --> 01:40:29,571
You know what this is, the question is..

712
01:40:29,571 --> 01:40:32,571
Are you ready?

713
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:38,196
Ayub. Where is he?

714
01:40:49,112 --> 01:40:53,196
In eternal damnation.

715
01:41:05,362 --> 01:41:06,571
Come on then!

716
01:41:09,487 --> 01:41:10,904
Do it!

717
01:41:17,737 --> 01:41:24,612
Are you so foolish, to escape from your own destiny,

718
01:41:26,112 --> 01:41:30,779
even after losing so much.

719
01:41:30,821 --> 01:41:33,654
Even after everything?

720
01:41:33,737 --> 01:41:37,904
Even after everything?

721
01:41:38,154 --> 01:41:42,696
You choose to selfishly extinguish your own life.

722
01:41:42,737 --> 01:41:46,154
As if your soul belongs to you.

723
01:41:46,196 --> 01:41:49,446
As if your soul belongs to only you.

724
01:41:49,529 --> 01:41:51,487
No!

725
01:41:51,571 --> 01:41:54,112
No!

726
01:41:57,029 --> 01:42:04,071
Your filthy soul has been mine since you were but a child.

727
01:42:06,404 --> 01:42:10,446
Only I shall claim it!

728
01:42:10,779 --> 01:42:15,112
Your soul belongs to Moloch!

729
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:41,654
Alfie..

730
01:43:38,904 --> 01:43:41,237
Alfie, let's go.

731
01:44:12,529 --> 01:44:13,362
Budi.

732
01:44:15,612 --> 01:44:17,696
Now you can start to find a decent job.

733
01:44:19,196 --> 01:44:22,737
So, you can buy a nicer car. Okay?

734
01:44:26,779 --> 01:44:29,821
Anyway, do we still need this?

735
01:44:31,071 --> 01:44:32,404
Or is it too dangerous?

736
01:44:34,737 --> 01:44:37,696
Dangerous? What's that?

737
01:44:42,071 --> 01:44:44,487
Nara, seat belt please.
