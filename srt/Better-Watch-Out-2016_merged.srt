1
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,027
Just your nose
and then we're done, Mr. Frost.

2
00:00:46,507 --> 00:00:48,597
You butt-fucker!

3
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:56,031
I'm a baby.

4
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:24,460
Boys! It's dinner time. Come inside please.

5
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,736
Hey, Mom. I know I said that
I would stay home and pack tonight...

6
00:01:31,816 --> 00:01:33,964
Yeah, of course I'm wearing headphones.

7
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,917
Anyway, yeah, so surprise!
I'm not home. Um...

8
00:01:39,997 --> 00:01:42,727
The Lerners asked me to babysit. What?

9
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:46,160
Sneak off and see Ricky?
Why would you... why would... why...

10
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,936
Shit!

11
00:01:52,107 --> 00:01:53,664
Sorry.

12
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:58,427
<i>Ashley! Ashley, are you okay?</i>

13
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:02,304
Hi, Mom, no, no, no, everything's fine.
It's just traffic.

14
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:05,797
Mom, look, I gotta go. I love you.

15
00:02:15,673 --> 00:02:19,560
Yeah, come here, come here.
Come on, give me a challenge.

16
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,760
Oh, that's right, you can't,
'cause I'm the best.

17
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,393
- Okay, here we go.
- Damn, I'm on a streak!

18
00:02:25,473 --> 00:02:28,893
"Want to put her in the mood?
Watch a horror movie.

19
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:31,393
"When we're scared,
our brains pump out dopamine...

20
00:02:31,473 --> 00:02:33,527
"...the same chemical we release
when we're aroused."

21
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:35,927
So fear really makes girls wet?

22
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:37,933
- Told ya.
- Bam!

23
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:40,497
You believe everything you read online.

24
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:44,631
- It's like with the paint cans.
- Oh, my God...

25
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:48,930
...are we seriously back to the paint
can debate? I ended that last week.

26
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,693
- I was unconvinced.
- No, no, no, no, no, we looked it up.

27
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:55,560
That ER doctor said that the paint can
would've smashed the robber's face in.

28
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,727
Just admit you're wrong.

29
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:00,308
Only reason to read
this stuff is for the pictures.

30
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,427
It's a plus. I know what women want.

31
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:05,427
- Dude.
- What?

32
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:08,260
She's, like, twice our age.
I really don't think it's gonna happen.

33
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,160
Five years. Big deal.
My parents are five years apart.

34
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,493
You don't get it.
Luke, Ashley's a ten. A solid ten.

35
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:17,664
And you're like a fi...

36
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:22,763
- Never mind.
- She likes me, I know it.

37
00:03:22,843 --> 00:03:25,064
- It's tonight or never.
- Okay, go ahead.

38
00:03:25,144 --> 00:03:28,327
But my brother gave me weed, so instead
of trying to bone your babysitter...

39
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:30,760
...maybe we could just,
you know... puff-puff?

40
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,227
No, man, I'm going through with the plan.

41
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:35,197
Don't mess it up for me.

42
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:40,831
I mean, Luke, for both our sakes,
I truly, sincerely hope you get some ass...

43
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,360
...sistance... uh, with that
computer problem you got.

44
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,327
Like, technical assistance.
Call, uh, Geek Squad.

45
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:50,927
- They're good.
- Real smooth, Einstein.

46
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:54,127
- You smell great, Mrs. Lerner.
- Don't you have a curfew, Garrett?

47
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:56,927
- Yeah, but my mom said I could stay in...
- Bed by 11:00, okay?

48
00:03:57,007 --> 00:04:00,060
- I know.
- And don't forget to brush your teeth.

49
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,147
I will, Mom.

50
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:04,031
- I left pizza money.
- Okay!

51
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,531
Robert.

52
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,693
Robert, turn that shit off.
It's giving me a migraine.

53
00:04:21,773 --> 00:04:27,643
Yes, uh, darling. My ornaments were
conspicuously missing from the tree.

54
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:29,727
We're not putting those on the tree.

55
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:33,427
Bell shoes, or I'll chop
your legs off below the knees.

56
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,397
Are you sure you've never
sucked another man's cock?

57
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:40,593
Not even in college? Not some lost weekend?

58
00:04:40,673 --> 00:04:44,960
Fishing trip? Secret, special friend? Ever?

59
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,360
- Not that I can recall.
- Because, honestly, Robert, this is so...

60
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,260
Meterosexual?

61
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,093
That's not even the word.
It's metro. Metrosexual.

62
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:57,560
- I'm allowed to like gay things.
- I need a drink.

63
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,050
Oh, my God, the fetus machine!

64
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,687
I forgot you still had this.

65
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:07,490
What the fuck? Dude!

66
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,197
That is so creepy. I'm sorry. Please
tell me you don't still sleep with this.

67
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:13,427
- You totally do.
- Shut up, dick.

68
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:15,893
- You so do.
- Of course not.

69
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:19,060
Hey, maybe it'll put you in the mood
while you're, you know...

70
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,647
She's here.

71
00:05:26,273 --> 00:05:29,493
Good Lord, you are breathtaking.

72
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:31,327
- Thank you.
- Nice sweater.

73
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:33,161
- Thanks, nice tie.
- Thank you.

74
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:36,078
So, uh, you're leaving us.
Deandra says that you're moving.

75
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:40,264
- Yeah, in a couple of days, to Pittsburg.
- Did I give you permission?

76
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:45,940
So thank you for coming
because you've gotta be busy packing.

77
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,960
Yeah, but I mean, I couldn't
leave without saying goodbye.

78
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,827
- Wow! What a nice thing to say.
- Mrs. Lerner, you look incredible.

79
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:56,593
Well, thank you.
But I told you, call me Deandra.

80
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:59,497
"Mrs. Lerner" makes me sound fossilized.

81
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,960
Robert!

82
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,693
Oh, look who decided to come out of his room.

83
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:06,960
Don't I remember something about
the trash getting taken out?

84
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,264
And don't forget the shovel.

85
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:15,220
Go on, Luke, and then we can hang out.

86
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,731
Yeah, come on, you grab the garbage
and I'll get the recycling.

87
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:24,327
I don't know about you,
but I'm gonna miss that girl.

88
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:26,264
New carpets!

89
00:06:26,973 --> 00:06:28,864
Damn it, Rob.

90
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,360
Here we go.

91
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,627
Okay, I want to show you this. We're going
to do things a little bit differently.

92
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:37,227
- Lucas has been sleepwalking again.
- Oh.

93
00:06:37,307 --> 00:06:38,860
No, crap!

94
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,831
Just a minute.

95
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,860
Garrett, what are you doing in here?

96
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,347
Oh. Uh, do you have any itch cream?

97
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,660
- My shoulder really...
- Top shelf.

98
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,093
Honestly, that kid is a bad influence.

99
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:57,560
I want you to keep an eye on him.

100
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,827
Once he's brushed and he's in bed, don't
forget to give him his sleeping pill, okay?

101
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:06,060
Then you take this pencil and you put it
on his door handle. See? Like that.

102
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,193
That way, if he stays in, great.
If he walks around, we know.

103
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:13,781
And what he doesn't know can't hurt him.

104
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:17,631
- Honey, it's time to go!
- All right.

105
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,660
Okay, Ashley, call us
if you need anything, all right?

106
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,593
See ya. Good luck.

107
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:29,427
Now, don't stay up and watch scary movies,
okay? It'll give you nightmares again.

108
00:07:29,507 --> 00:07:31,460
Please don't do that.
You're embarrassing the lad.

109
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,560
- Robert, that tie.
- I know, right!

110
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,087
No, wrong. Please, please, please? Thank you.

111
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,313
Always be...

112
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,760
...prepared.

113
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,357
Please don't embarrass me like last year.

114
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,294
I promise.

115
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,164
Finally.

116
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,393
So what do you wanna do?

117
00:07:57,473 --> 00:08:00,647
- Movie?
- Actually, I gotta make a call.

118
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:03,797
So how about you hang out
and play video games or something?

119
00:08:12,507 --> 00:08:15,164
This is just happening so fast, you know?

120
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,193
I just need some space tonight.

121
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:22,364
Like, clear my head, say goodbye to
everything, if that makes any sense.

122
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:27,731
Ricky, of course I wanted to see you.

123
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I don't know. 11:30.
Well, if you want to break
a few dozen perv laws...
...you could always ignore me
and come over anyway.
Ricky, no, that was a joke. No, don't.

124
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,060
Luke! Luke!

125
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,797
- What?
- There's a spider. Kill it.

126
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,797
Just kill it. Squish it!

127
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,531
It didn't do anything wrong.

128
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,027
<i>Ash!</i>

129
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,060
<i>Ashley! Ashley, are you okay?</i>

130
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,664
What?

131
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:07,153
I can handle myself just fine, thank you.

132
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:09,264
The answer's still no.

133
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,560
Go on. You're free now.

134
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,727
There you go, big guy.

135
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:17,727
Ricky, I know.

136
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,088
Yes, I know I leave soon.

137
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:25,555
You know you're my guy.
Can't we hang out tomorrow?

138
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:30,221
Okay.

139
00:09:31,607 --> 00:09:35,055
Okay. Okay, well, maybe
if kiddo falls asleep early.

140
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:40,021
Okay. All right, bye.

141
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:05,755
Luke?

142
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:09,921
Luke!

143
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:14,821
Luke, where are you?

144
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:24,655
Luke, where are you?

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

146
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,393
Luke!

147
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:40,193
- Lucas, what are you doing?
- Oh, you won't?

148
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,627
No, you are way too young
to be drinking. Give me that.

149
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:45,793
- Oh, this?
- Yes, that. Give it to me.

150
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:49,021
Lucas, stop! What has gotten into you?

151
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:53,527
One time me and Garrett drank a whole bottle.

152
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:56,593
He puked so bad.
He can't hold his liquor like me.

153
00:10:56,673 --> 00:10:59,721
Wow, I'm super impressed, okay? Now, give it.

154
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:03,888
Lucas, I'm so serious right now.

155
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,327
Don't.

156
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,221
Thank you.

157
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,460
Oh, my God.

158
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,393
Pardon me.

159
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:25,188
You forgot to shut the door, doofus.

160
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:43,155
I can't believe I'm doing this.

161
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,593
Hey, no, sorry, I can't...
I can't talk right now.

162
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:53,103
He just opened a bottle of champagne.

163
00:11:53,407 --> 00:11:55,860
Uh-uh, no, that is not an invitation.

164
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,521
Look, um, listen, I don't think
tonight's gonna work out.

165
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:04,513
A chance to what? Make things harder
than they already are? What?

166
00:12:05,573 --> 00:12:09,388
Okay, you know what? That was a low blow,
and I'm gonna hang up now.

167
00:12:19,147 --> 00:12:20,440
Busted.

168
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,260
Me? What about you, mister?

169
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,588
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

170
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:28,355
Okay, deal.

171
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:36,808
You know, drinking won't impress me, okay?
I already think you're pretty cool.

172
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:42,288
Let's, uh... let's get
some food into you, hey?

173
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Pepperoni or Hawaiian?
- Anything but mushrooms.

174
00:12:48,873 --> 00:12:50,960
Why don't you start the...

175
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,856
Whoa, calm down. Have another drink.

176
00:12:57,973 --> 00:12:59,855
Lerner residence.

177
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,088
Hello?

178
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:05,088
Hello?

179
00:13:13,273 --> 00:13:16,055
<i>Help! Somebody help me!</i>

180
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:20,688
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

181
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:29,088
- Who was it?
- No one.

182
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,527
Why are you dating Ricky?

183
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:36,108
He's such a jerk.

184
00:13:38,607 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

185
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,921
How did you mean it?

186
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:48,793
It's just like first Jeremy and now Ricky.

187
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:52,039
You could choose any guy in the world,
and you're choosing these guys...

188
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:54,327
- ...who treat you like shit.
- Luke...

189
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:56,627
...first off, you're sweet...

190
00:13:56,707 --> 00:13:59,993
...but second, there's actually
a really wonderful side to Ricky.

191
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:04,060
And my move's been really
tough on us, so be nice.

192
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,393
Plus, you're drunk, kiddo.

193
00:14:06,473 --> 00:14:09,927
I am not drunk and I am not a kiddo.

194
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,188
- You're 12.
- Thirteen in a few weeks.

195
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,188
- I'm mature for my age.
- I know.

196
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,793
If I were your age, I'd date you.

197
00:14:22,873 --> 00:14:24,388
Really?

198
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:33,220
Shit! I forgot to order the pizza.

199
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:42,897
God, Luke, you didn't tell me
you ordered something.

200
00:14:42,977 --> 00:14:44,848
I didn't.

201
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,193
Hi. Sorry, we didn't order that.

202
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:51,593
This 312 Claremont?

203
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:54,460
- Yeah.
- Well, someone ordered this.

204
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,021
It was probably my dad.
Here, keep the change.

205
00:15:00,473 --> 00:15:03,127
Hey, you, uh... you have a pleasant night.

206
00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:05,088
Okay, thanks.

207
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,491
Plates and napkins, mister...

208
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,688
I fuckin' hate this thing.

209
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,260
- <i>You come here a lot?</i>
- <i>Every now and then.</i>

210
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,560
<i>Come here to think, be by myself.</i>

211
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,093
What? It's good ambience.

212
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:30,655
You are something else tonight.

213
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:40,288
Wait, if your dad ordered the pizza,
why is there mushrooms on it?

214
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,455
I don't know, 'cause they're like vegetables?

215
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:49,735
- <i>Hey, you mind grabbing those beers?</i>
- <i>Sure, hold on.</i>

216
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:03,621
<i>Hello?</i>

217
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,555
<i>Cindy, don't be stupid.</i>

218
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:17,263
<i>My boyfriend's going to kill me
if I don't get home soon.</i>

219
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:20,055
<i>Your boyfriend isn't here.</i>

220
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,430
<i>You're bad.</i>

221
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:35,993
So what are your family's
plans for the holidays?

222
00:16:36,073 --> 00:16:38,112
Drinking and arguing.

223
00:16:39,502 --> 00:16:41,321
You crack me up.

224
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,055
Ricky, why can't you just leave me alone?

225
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:52,688
Look, I'll be back in one second, okay?

226
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:55,960
Hello?

227
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,660
Oh, you crack me up.

228
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,288
Okay, we'll see.

229
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:06,495
Yeah, I don't know. I said, "We'll see!"

230
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:10,427
Hey, I'm still pissed at you, you know.
You don't get off that easy.

231
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:14,555
I'll talk to you later, maybe. Okay, bye-bye.

232
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:19,279
Hey...

233
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,493
...you'll always be my little buddy.
You know that, right?

234
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:26,458
- Can we just watch the movie?
- <i>Hey, where'd you go?</i>

235
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:30,427
<i>Bobby, are you up there?</i>

236
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:34,488
Oh, my God! No, I can't!
I can't watch this part.

237
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,396
Why would... why would they go
into the attic? It's just...

238
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,497
...oh, it's so stupid.

239
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,293
Oh, God!

240
00:17:52,473 --> 00:17:55,921
- Did you hear that?
- Mmm-mmm.

241
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:07,693
Luke, Luke, Luke, no! No, no, no, Luke.

242
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:09,860
- Why?
- No, just because, Luke.

243
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,393
- I know you've been drinking...
- So have you, so why won't you kiss me?

244
00:18:12,473 --> 00:18:15,555
Because, Luke, it is the most
inappropriate thing ever!

245
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:18,360
Okay?

246
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,988
Lerner residence.

247
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,355
- Are you gonna talk?
- <i>I can see you.</i>

248
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,260
Is this Jeremy?

249
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,327
<i>Joey, is that you?</i>

250
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:44,455
If you can see me,
how many fingers am I holding up?

251
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:49,160
<i>No, let's get out of here.
There's somebody out there.</i>

252
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,327
- <i>There's somebody over there!</i>
- Luke, could you just turn that off?

253
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:55,693
- Why?
- Can you just, please?

254
00:18:55,773 --> 00:18:58,855
<i>Come on, let's go.
There's somebody out there...</i>

255
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:02,329
Can you... give me that. Luke?

256
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,855
Was it Jeremy?

257
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:09,888
I don't think so.

258
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Then who was it?
Everyone knows he's totally
obsessed with you.

259
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:21,304
What the fuck!

260
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:25,255
Where's the hose?
I'm spraying whoever's out there.

261
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,388
Luke, get my phone!

262
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:40,127
- Oh, goddamn it, Luke!
- Oh, shit! Sorry!

263
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:42,760
- God, do you know how much that cost me?
- I didn't mean to.

264
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,973
8 Plus. Do you not look when you're throwing?

265
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:47,721
Ashley, my mom'll buy you another one.

266
00:19:49,307 --> 00:19:51,121
Oh, Luke!

267
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,460
- What, I'm not scared.
- Yeah, well, we don't know who it is.

268
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,421
Then look.

269
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,660
No one's there.

270
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,888
What the hell?

271
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Luke, no! Don't. What are you... Luke!
Whoever's out there, cut it out.
I know tae kwon do.

272
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,760
See? Scared 'em...

273
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:23,093
Hi. How are you?

274
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:25,008
Get off me!

275
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:28,872
Dude! Your guy's faces!
Your faces. You were like...

276
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:30,760
- You asshole!
- What the hell, man?

277
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,093
- Come on, I'm just checking up on you kids.
- I nearly called the fucking police!

278
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:36,027
What were you doing
sneaking around back there?

279
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:37,393
- Back where?
- In the backyard.

280
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:39,730
I didn't go in the backyard.

281
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,421
Stay here.

282
00:20:47,907 --> 00:20:50,988
- What was that?
- I... I don't...

283
00:20:51,973 --> 00:20:54,427
- Hey, hey, hey, what's that for?
- Luke, where's your phone?

284
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:56,927
- My parents took it.
- I have one.

285
00:20:57,007 --> 00:21:01,693
Okay, dial 911. I'm going up there.
If I scream, press send and hide, got it?

286
00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:03,321
Okay.

287
00:21:05,573 --> 00:21:08,655
Dude, if this is a prank,
I'm kicking you in the balls.

288
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,162
- Jesus! What are you doing? Stay down there.
- We heard something.

289
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:22,088
- Please don't leave us alone.
- Okay, but just stay right behind me.

290
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:43,231
Where did the noise come from?

291
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:02,411
Oh, my God.

292
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:09,488
Someone's about to spend
Christmas in fucking jail.

293
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:16,355
What?

294
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:19,221
My phone always works here.

295
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,668
What?

296
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,827
What the fuck? Where's the computer?

297
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:34,673
- Guys!
- It's in my room.

298
00:22:35,173 --> 00:22:38,388
We need the police. If this is Jeremy,
I'm not even fucking around.

299
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:42,127
- Shit.
- What the hell? Where's FinnAndJake?

300
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:45,527
- What's that?
- The network. It's gone.

301
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:48,234
- How are they doing this?
- Okay, Luke, come with me.

302
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:51,093
Garrett, stay here and just get
on another one of those like...

303
00:22:51,173 --> 00:22:52,327
- Wi-Fi?
- They're all locked.

304
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:56,727
No, God, Garrett!
Just use your fuckin' techno magic.

305
00:22:56,807 --> 00:23:00,621
Hey. Hey! What the fuck's that supposed to...

306
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,733
Jesus Christ!

307
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:08,288
Okay, we just need to find the security
panel, and the cops'll be here in minutes.

308
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,660
How the hell don't you have
a security system?

309
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,293
We never needed one.
It's a really safe neighborhood.

310
00:23:15,373 --> 00:23:18,660
Okay, we'll just take my car.
We'll grab it and we'll, um...

311
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,755
What is it?

312
00:23:23,507 --> 00:23:25,921
Stay back. Get against the door.

313
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,827
Garrett! Garrett!

314
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:33,321
Garrett, what are you doing? Get down!

315
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,055
Garrett, get away from the window!

316
00:23:37,573 --> 00:23:40,421
- It was on the other side.
- What was?

317
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the fuck is that?
Did you hear that?

318
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,477
Get upstairs.
Everybody get upstairs. Move! Shit!

319
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,893
- I'm getting out of here.
- Garrett, come back! Garrett!

320
00:23:56,973 --> 00:23:58,470
Garrett!

321
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:17,263
What happened to Garrett?

322
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,155
Is he hurt?

323
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,227
Listen, okay?

324
00:24:44,307 --> 00:24:46,593
We're gonna... we're gonna go upstairs, okay?

325
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:49,427
In the bedroom and lock the door and hide.

326
00:24:49,507 --> 00:24:51,293
And then what?

327
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:54,460
And then what? We're going to scream
out of the window, okay?

328
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,093
We're going to scream as hard as we
can until the neighbors can hear...

329
00:24:57,173 --> 00:25:00,927
- ...and then they'll call the cops.
- What if they shoot us?

330
00:25:01,007 --> 00:25:03,493
What if it makes them come inside?

331
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:05,053
Look at me.

332
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:08,821
I need your help,
and I need you to stay calm.

333
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,647
- We're gonna get through this, okay?
- Okay.

334
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:15,360
- Do your parents have a gun?
- Yeah.

335
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,593
Where do they keep it?

336
00:25:17,673 --> 00:25:20,460
By my parents' bed, Dad's side.

337
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,560
Okay, we get the gun.
And if anyone tries to come inside, we'll...

338
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,288
...you know, we'll shoot 'em.

339
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,460
Okay.

340
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,055
Okay.

341
00:25:53,873 --> 00:25:56,521
Hug the wall and stay in the shadows, okay?

342
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,921
There's someone there.

343
00:26:45,073 --> 00:26:46,875
What are they doing?

344
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:52,588
What do they want?

345
00:26:57,707 --> 00:26:59,555
What do we do?

346
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,855
Go, go, go, go, go, go. He's coming!

347
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,960
Okay.

348
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,720
Okay, Luke, we're just going
to stay here until they leave.

349
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,293
They killed Garrett.
What if they kill my parents, too?

350
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:57,814
No. Lucas, that is not going to happen, okay?

351
00:27:58,873 --> 00:28:01,696
- I think we should get the gun.
- No, Luke...

352
00:28:01,776 --> 00:28:05,801
...the guys down there have
a shotgun, okay? No, we're staying here.

353
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,493
What are you doing? Stay here! Jesus, Luke.

354
00:28:10,673 --> 00:28:13,460
Lucas! Seriously!

355
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,422
Luke, they can hear us. Where are you?

356
00:28:16,502 --> 00:28:18,493
- Shit, something's on me. Luke!
- What?

357
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:20,593
- Oh, shit, something's on me!
- What is it?

358
00:28:20,673 --> 00:28:22,183
Shit!

359
00:28:22,263 --> 00:28:25,193
No, no, on my face! Get it off!

360
00:28:25,273 --> 00:28:27,318
- Ash, look at me!
- Get it off! Get it off!

361
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:29,393
Look at me!

362
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:32,321
I got you. You're going to be okay.

363
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,893
- I can't do this.
- I've just gotta get my dad's gun.

364
00:28:53,573 --> 00:28:55,388
Then we'll be okay.

365
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,921
It's okay.

366
00:28:58,173 --> 00:29:00,060
It's okay to cry.

367
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,821
I'm scared, too.

368
00:29:04,573 --> 00:29:07,903
- But I have to get the gun.
- Wait, no.

369
00:29:07,983 --> 00:29:09,493
Wait.

370
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

371
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

372
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:41,655
Quick! I think he's downstairs.

373
00:29:49,073 --> 00:29:51,960
- Is that loaded?
- Yeah, I checked.

374
00:30:03,173 --> 00:30:04,655
No!

375
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:14,888
Okay, go, go, go.

376
00:30:17,928 --> 00:30:20,627
You stay here. I'm gonna go out there
and I'm gonna scare them away.

377
00:30:20,707 --> 00:30:24,360
- No, no, Luke, stay here.
- Don't worry, I'll protect you.

378
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,922
Luke, going out there's not
brave, okay? It's stupid. Luke!

379
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Trust me. Let go of me.
- Luke, come back!
- Oh, my God!
- Shit!
- Can you turn it off?
- It won't.

380
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:52,055
Go away.

381
00:30:53,907 --> 00:30:55,755
Go away.

382
00:30:57,307 --> 00:30:59,321
Luke, I'm so sorry.

383
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:11,955
Please go away.

384
00:31:22,373 --> 00:31:24,271
That's your mask.

385
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:32,095
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

386
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:34,988
- Ash, no!
- Garrett!

387
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,888
Ah, dude?

388
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,188
Take that mask off!

389
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,693
What?

390
00:31:52,773 --> 00:31:55,360
What? Is this a fuckin' joke?

391
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,493
I... we were gonna scare you.

392
00:31:57,573 --> 00:32:00,973
Yeah, you did. You scared the shit out of me.
Why? Why? Why would you do that?

393
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:03,827
I was gonna go save you, but dipshit here...

394
00:32:03,907 --> 00:32:06,267
Luke, your friend is holding a real gun!

395
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:09,487
- This is serious. How could you do that?
- Because you treat me like a child.

396
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:12,127
And what, you were going to show me
how much of a man you were by...

397
00:32:12,207 --> 00:32:16,427
...rescuing me from fake armed robbers?
You are a child!

398
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:18,588
I almost broke my neck.

399
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,427
What delusional infant thinks
that staging a break-in...

400
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:26,955
...is gonna get you to second base?

401
00:32:28,273 --> 00:32:30,160
You're mental!

402
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,846
You're a selfish brat with no consideration,
and you need therapy. Lots of it.

403
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:40,793
I'm gonna go and put
your dad's hunting stuff...

404
00:32:40,873 --> 00:32:45,560
No, Garrett, you stay right fucking there.
Luke, you are in so much trouble.

405
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,488
I'm calling your parents.

406
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:52,627
Ashley.

407
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:56,005
- Ashley! Ashley!
- What?

408
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:03,955
Dude, what'd you just do?

409
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,988
What the fuck did you just do?

410
00:33:40,273 --> 00:33:43,555
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I'm moving so fast!

411
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:56,693
Whoa! Okay, uh, kill-fuck Mary
with the Adventure Time chicks.

412
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:58,288
Go.

413
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:02,393
Fuck Princess Bubblegum.

414
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,827
- What? Not Marceline?
- Hell no.

415
00:34:05,907 --> 00:34:09,293
One, she's made of bubble gum so she can,
like, stretch, which leads to two...

416
00:34:09,373 --> 00:34:13,689
- ...her pussy tastes like bubble gum.
- Ooh, dude, that means she's all, like...

417
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:16,493
...like sticky and moist and shit.

418
00:34:16,573 --> 00:34:20,460
- Dude, those are pros.
- Where'd you learn that, your mom?

419
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,360
No, your sister.

420
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,393
Further, everyone from the Candy
Kingdom is ravenous for flesh...

421
00:34:26,473 --> 00:34:29,083
...so you know she gives legendary head.

422
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,938
Yeah, as long as you don't mind
cutting gum out of your pubes.

423
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:36,581
Not that you have to worry about that.

424
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:43,141
Oh, my God, dude.

425
00:34:44,073 --> 00:34:46,955
You gotta have one of these. It's like...

426
00:34:48,107 --> 00:34:50,155
...it's like marshmallows.

427
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:54,293
Everywhere.

428
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:56,893
Maybe I should have given you a half dose.

429
00:34:56,973 --> 00:35:00,293
- What'd you call it again?
- Oxy.

430
00:35:00,373 --> 00:35:03,588
Oxy. It's awesome.

431
00:35:04,423 --> 00:35:08,427
It's awesome. Awesome,
awesome, awesome, awesome.

432
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,993
Awesome.

433
00:35:11,073 --> 00:35:12,955
Is that a word?

434
00:35:15,673 --> 00:35:17,663
Oh, I gotta do that again.

435
00:35:18,173 --> 00:35:20,660
I'm gonna go and explore.

436
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,960
Watch the carpet!
Dammit, my mom will kill me!

437
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,327
- Sorry.
- Just get out of there.

438
00:35:29,807 --> 00:35:31,655
Come on.

439
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,284
Sure you know what you're doing?

440
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,555
Always.

441
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,723
Something's missing.

442
00:35:43,803 --> 00:35:46,255
What the fuck is going on?

443
00:35:56,307 --> 00:36:00,393
Jesus! How many different
lotions do you have?

444
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:14,027
There.

445
00:36:14,107 --> 00:36:15,860
All better.

446
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,893
Dude, that's fucked up.

447
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:21,621
Come on, it's hilarious.
What do you think, Ashley?

448
00:36:22,423 --> 00:36:26,649
Oh, thank you, Luke.
I've literally never looked better!

449
00:36:29,807 --> 00:36:32,793
You're probably wondering what's going on.

450
00:36:32,873 --> 00:36:34,727
It's out in the open now.

451
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:37,055
You know how I feel about you.

452
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:40,453
Look...

453
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:44,618
...I really, really don't
want to shoot you, Ashley...

454
00:36:44,973 --> 00:36:46,843
...but I will.

455
00:36:46,923 --> 00:36:50,960
So if I take the gag off,
you won't scream, right?

456
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,421
'Cause then I have no other choice
but to shoot you, and like I said...

457
00:36:56,473 --> 00:37:00,055
...I really, really don't want to.

458
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,288
You get me?

459
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,627
- Luke, listen to me, okay?
- Uh-uh-uh. I didn't say talk.

460
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:15,955
You talk when I tell you.

461
00:37:35,873 --> 00:37:38,360
Okay. Talk.

462
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,260
Luke, listen to me, okay?
I think I have a concussion.

463
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,143
I need to go to the hospital.
Put the gun down and untie me.

464
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:48,860
- This needs to stop immediately.
- No.

465
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,267
Whatever you think that you're
gonna get away with, you're not.

466
00:37:52,347 --> 00:37:55,267
Ashley, you used to tell me
I could get away with murder.

467
00:37:55,347 --> 00:37:58,055
- Luke!
- I'm just kidding. God, Ashley.

468
00:37:58,135 --> 00:38:00,980
Lighten the fuck up. I'll tell you what.

469
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:04,183
- Let's play truth or dare.
- How about you untie me right fucking now?

470
00:38:04,263 --> 00:38:06,475
Language, Ashley.

471
00:38:07,107 --> 00:38:10,827
If you win, I will untie you,
but if you lose...

472
00:38:10,907 --> 00:38:13,555
...well, if you lose...

473
00:38:14,573 --> 00:38:16,588
...then you drink this.

474
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:19,821
What is that?

475
00:38:20,307 --> 00:38:23,593
We'll call it my insurance policy.

476
00:38:24,573 --> 00:38:27,260
Isn't it amazing what you can get
on the playground these days.

477
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,593
Luke, I have known you since you were eight.

478
00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:32,262
You're threatening me with a gun tonight.
This is not okay.

479
00:38:32,342 --> 00:38:36,893
Whatever. Neither is, like,
political corruption in West Africa.

480
00:38:36,973 --> 00:38:40,127
By the way, I need help
with that paper. It's due Monday.

481
00:38:40,207 --> 00:38:42,097
Okay, Ashley, I'll go first.

482
00:38:42,177 --> 00:38:44,720
- Truth or dare?
- I dare you to grow up.

483
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,393
Truth or dare, Ashley?

484
00:38:47,773 --> 00:38:50,021
Don't make me point the gun at you.

485
00:38:50,973 --> 00:38:52,855
This is so stupid.

486
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,390
- Truth.
- I knew you'd say that.

487
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,641
Okay, truth. How many guys have you fucked?

488
00:39:01,721 --> 00:39:03,793
What? Luke, what are you doing?
This isn't you.

489
00:39:03,873 --> 00:39:05,921
Just answer the question.

490
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,393
- None.
- Bullshit! You're not a virgin.

491
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,227
Everybody knows you screwed Jeremy.

492
00:39:12,307 --> 00:39:16,293
No, I broke up with him because he
went around telling everybody that.

493
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:19,360
Okay. Guess it's my turn then.

494
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,455
Uh, Luke, truth or dare?

495
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:24,793
Well, it'll be dare of course.

496
00:39:24,873 --> 00:39:27,688
Okay. Um...

497
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:32,480
I dare you to touch her tit.

498
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,621
- No, please don't do that.
- It's the universal rules, Ashley.

499
00:39:42,397 --> 00:39:44,252
Do you have a preference?

500
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,088
Right or left?

501
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:55,855
Fine, I'll pick.

502
00:40:02,473 --> 00:40:06,313
Oh, that is nice.

503
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:09,455
I can see what all the fuss is about.

504
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:12,192
Dude, are you...

505
00:40:14,723 --> 00:40:18,260
- Shut up!
- Hey, hey. Hey, why are you shoving?

506
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,060
Don't push me, dude. I will kick your ass.

507
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,355
Okay. Okay.

508
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:31,893
It's pretty nice, huh? How'd that feel?

509
00:40:31,973 --> 00:40:34,421
Like a little boy just felt me up.

510
00:40:36,007 --> 00:40:37,521
Ashley...

511
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:43,233
...do you know what it's like to love
someone who doesn't love you back?

512
00:40:43,313 --> 00:40:45,578
- More than you'd know.
- No, you don't. Everyone loves you.

513
00:40:45,658 --> 00:40:49,927
- All the guys wanna fuck you.
- Oh, Luke. You are in so much trouble...

514
00:40:50,007 --> 00:40:52,821
...the both of you,
when your parents come home.

515
00:41:04,773 --> 00:41:07,849
They're never going to find out.

516
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,388
Your turn.

517
00:41:18,307 --> 00:41:22,155
- Luke, truth or dare.
- Why isn't anybody asking me?

518
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,593
Truth.

519
00:41:24,673 --> 00:41:27,721
Did you ever tell Garrett
that you killed his hamster?

520
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,430
- What?
- The answer is no. Next turn.

521
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,260
You said LeBron escaped
out of the hole in my screen.

522
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,960
- He did. He was just dead first.
- What the fuck, man?

523
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,888
It was an accident and besides,
it was, like, two years ago.

524
00:41:39,968 --> 00:41:42,827
You have a cat now
so he would have died anyway.

525
00:41:43,207 --> 00:41:45,688
Garrett, truth or dare?

526
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,260
Why would you lie to me?

527
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,521
Truth or dare?

528
00:41:52,873 --> 00:41:54,393
Dare.

529
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:57,355
Dare, and you'd better dare us to...

530
00:41:57,435 --> 00:41:59,797
- ...to make out or something.
- Not on your life.

531
00:41:59,877 --> 00:42:03,193
- Why not? Why do you get to have all the fun?
- Because she's my babysitter.

532
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:05,727
- You don't touch her.
- Then what am I even doing here, dude?

533
00:42:05,807 --> 00:42:08,893
We were just gonna scare her
and now this has turned into, like, shit.

534
00:42:09,673 --> 00:42:13,121
What if we get caught?
Look, I don't like this, man.

535
00:42:16,873 --> 00:42:18,388
Really?

536
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,760
Dude, stop! What are you doing?

537
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,427
Dude, I'm done, man. I just wanna go home.

538
00:42:25,507 --> 00:42:28,593
No, no, no, you can't go now.
We have to finish this.

539
00:42:28,673 --> 00:42:31,393
This isn't as much fun
as you said it would be.

540
00:42:31,473 --> 00:42:35,093
What if someone finds out?
You know what they do to white kids in jail.

541
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:38,727
Garrett, listen to me.
You're an accomplice now.

542
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:41,527
You'll get caught if you don't help me.

543
00:42:41,607 --> 00:42:45,350
We have to stick to the plan.
She won't remember any of this, trust me.

544
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:49,455
Fine. Let's just... let's get this over with.

545
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,788
Shit!

546
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,555
Shit!

547
00:43:05,973 --> 00:43:09,188
Aw, so close.

548
00:43:13,973 --> 00:43:18,455
So, because you cheated,
here's what's gonna happen.

549
00:43:20,107 --> 00:43:23,365
When my parents get home, they'll find you...

550
00:43:23,445 --> 00:43:27,593
...passed out and realize
that after I went to sleep...

551
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:30,434
...you raided the liquor cabinet
and partied hard...

552
00:43:30,514 --> 00:43:33,363
...before your big move to Pittsburg.

553
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,993
Exhibit A and Exhibit B.

554
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,402
And in the morning...

555
00:43:40,032 --> 00:43:42,236
...you won't remember any of this.

556
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,860
Luke walked me through. It's the best way.

557
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,460
Luke is taking you straight
to jail with him, Garrett.

558
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,727
You're making a big mistake. Just run.
Call the cops now. You can stop this.

559
00:43:52,807 --> 00:43:55,427
- Drink.
- Hard pass.

560
00:43:55,507 --> 00:44:00,127
Come on! You love drinking.
You drink with Ricky all the time.

561
00:44:00,207 --> 00:44:02,021
What's the problem?

562
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,293
Eyes up here.

563
00:44:06,873 --> 00:44:09,566
If you drink, all of this goes away.

564
00:44:10,073 --> 00:44:12,121
We don't have to do this.

565
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,821
Drink.

566
00:44:17,273 --> 00:44:18,993
Oh, you bitch!

567
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,727
Help!

568
00:44:21,807 --> 00:44:25,221
No, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

569
00:44:28,307 --> 00:44:29,860
Stop.

570
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,760
Stay calm, and stay here and clean this up.

571
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,327
Okay.

572
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,593
Hey, hey.

573
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,527
- Who is it?
- I'm here to see Ashley.

574
00:44:44,007 --> 00:44:47,227
- Ricky?
- Yeah, man, open the door.

575
00:44:47,307 --> 00:44:50,293
- She's not here.
- Listen, I know she's in there.

576
00:44:50,373 --> 00:44:53,393
She texted me to come over,
like, half an hour ago.

577
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:55,488
She doesn't want to see you.

578
00:44:56,073 --> 00:44:59,093
- I just wanna talk to her.
- Go away.

579
00:44:59,473 --> 00:45:01,693
She doesn't love you anymore.

580
00:45:02,073 --> 00:45:03,921
She told me.

581
00:45:06,407 --> 00:45:07,993
Ashley!

582
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:11,493
- Ashley, come out and talk to me!
- Dude, shut up! She doesn't want to see you.

583
00:45:11,573 --> 00:45:14,060
All right. All right.

584
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,221
Hey, listen, man.
Could you just give her these, please?

585
00:45:19,473 --> 00:45:22,493
Fine. Pass them through the door.

586
00:45:22,773 --> 00:45:26,021
All right, awesome. Thanks, man.

587
00:45:28,373 --> 00:45:30,294
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Hey, get out!

588
00:45:30,374 --> 00:45:32,150
Ash!

589
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,079
You have pizza?

590
00:45:39,673 --> 00:45:41,227
Ash!

591
00:45:41,807 --> 00:45:44,655
Dude, what the... why is that music so loud?

592
00:45:45,073 --> 00:45:46,621
Ash!

593
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,660
Are you hiding?

594
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,455
- 'Cause I'll find you!
- No! She's upset.

595
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,393
Dude, I know that.
What do you think these are for?

596
00:45:55,473 --> 00:46:00,093
- So she can't see you till tomorrow.
- Be quiet please. Please, please!

597
00:46:00,173 --> 00:46:02,055
Dude, why not?

598
00:46:04,907 --> 00:46:07,393
Hey, I got... I got the rat.

599
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,227
The big rat.
The fucker was fast, but I got him...

600
00:46:10,307 --> 00:46:12,248
Where is she?

601
00:46:12,328 --> 00:46:13,960
Where's Ash?

602
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,780
Upstairs, but it's probably better
if you come back tomorrow. No!

603
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,305
It's not just you. She has cramps.

604
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,721
- What?
- Menstrual cramps.

605
00:46:24,673 --> 00:46:27,488
- It's real bad.
- Yeah, she has diarrhea, too.

606
00:46:29,707 --> 00:46:31,255
Oh.

607
00:46:31,607 --> 00:46:34,137
Ash! I'm gonna come up!
I don't care what you have.

608
00:46:34,217 --> 00:46:36,583
- Fucking diarrhea?
- Sorry, dude. What do we do?

609
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:39,688
I don't know. Just stay with her.

610
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,488
What the hell are you doing?

611
00:46:56,007 --> 00:46:58,255
That was so not cool.

612
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,555
Ash!

613
00:47:09,473 --> 00:47:12,451
- Dude, where the hell is she?
- I told you, she doesn't want to see you.

614
00:47:12,531 --> 00:47:16,355
Ashley! Come on, you don't
have to be embarrassed.

615
00:47:19,573 --> 00:47:21,121
Babe!

616
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,224
Don't you, have like...

617
00:47:24,304 --> 00:47:27,180
...some tampons, or something?

618
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,493
Dude, what happened...

619
00:47:48,273 --> 00:47:50,355
What the fuck?

620
00:47:51,773 --> 00:47:53,293
Hey!

621
00:47:53,473 --> 00:47:55,167
What the fuck are you doing?

622
00:48:00,073 --> 00:48:01,460
What have you done with her?

623
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,640
Hey, where is she?

624
00:48:13,373 --> 00:48:15,227
You're fuckin' dead,
you little piece of shit!

625
00:48:15,307 --> 00:48:18,360
Hey, hey, hey! Ah, drop it. Drop it.

626
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,327
I'm serious. I'll blow
your fuckin' face off in three, two...

627
00:48:22,407 --> 00:48:24,621
All right, all right, all right.

628
00:48:25,773 --> 00:48:27,927
Whoa, man! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

629
00:48:28,007 --> 00:48:31,345
- Okay, don't shoot me, okay?
- Okay, get on your knees. Please.

630
00:48:31,425 --> 00:48:34,921
- Okay, okay. All right, all right!
- Please, get on your knees.

631
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:37,993
Okay, thank you.

632
00:48:38,073 --> 00:48:41,255
- He lines up the shot.
- No, no, no! Luke!

633
00:48:44,307 --> 00:48:46,860
What the fuck? Holy shit! What do we do now?

634
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:51,327
- Isn't this exciting?
- No! No, dude, we're going to jail.

635
00:48:51,407 --> 00:48:53,460
Don't you get it?
We're going to fucking jail!

636
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:57,355
- Luke, we're gonna fuckin' die in prison.
- No, we're not.

637
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,148
Fuck!

638
00:49:19,003 --> 00:49:21,255
Why can't we just roofie them both?

639
00:49:22,373 --> 00:49:24,627
That was all I had. And even if it wasn't...

640
00:49:24,707 --> 00:49:27,793
...Jiffy Lube here
has a fucking hole in his face.

641
00:49:27,873 --> 00:49:30,327
You really messed things up, Ricky.

642
00:49:30,407 --> 00:49:34,093
Things just got a whole lot more
complicated for me and Garrett.

643
00:49:42,223 --> 00:49:43,760
Ah.

644
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,060
- Just let Ricky go.
- We both know I can't do that.

645
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,600
We can say that he fell
on an exposed nail or something.

646
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,730
Garrett can go with him to verify
the conversation with his roommate.

647
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,927
You and I, we stay here, we clean up.

648
00:49:55,007 --> 00:49:57,093
You go to bed before your parents
get home and then...

649
00:49:57,173 --> 00:50:00,660
You call the cops and they
arrest me in my jammies.

650
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,827
I don't think so, Ash.

651
00:50:03,107 --> 00:50:05,155
What if she's serious?

652
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:10,560
- Dude, she can help us get out of this.
- You got a lot to learn about women.

653
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,260
Why didn't you listen? I said I'd text you.

654
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:16,560
- You did text me.
- What?

655
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,655
Check my phone.

656
00:50:20,807 --> 00:50:23,760
- You texted him.
- What are you talking about?

657
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,100
You don't want us to get out of this.
You invited him here!

658
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,540
- Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
- Luke, what the...

659
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,753
- You texted Ricky to come here, didn't you?
- No, man. Why would I do that?

660
00:50:39,807 --> 00:50:44,268
Okay, I did. I was gonna tell you, but
Grease Monkey got here 15 minutes early.

661
00:50:44,348 --> 00:50:46,164
Caught me off guard.

662
00:50:46,244 --> 00:50:49,960
- Lighten up. I got it all planned out.
- Yeah, what else you got planned?

663
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,080
- What else are you gonna lie to me about?
- Garrett, go take a walk...

664
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,455
...and chill the fuck out.

665
00:50:58,807 --> 00:51:01,936
Garrett? Garrett, no,
please don't go. Please.

666
00:51:02,016 --> 00:51:04,087
Just take another oxy if you have to.

667
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,848
Oh, look.

668
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,027
Your phone still works.

669
00:51:20,107 --> 00:51:23,068
It's about time we invite our second guest.

670
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:25,960
The douchebag ex.

671
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,855
Jeremy?

672
00:51:31,707 --> 00:51:33,755
Invite him here.

673
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,275
I'm not asking.

674
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,093
You're not going to shoot me, Luke.

675
00:51:43,173 --> 00:51:46,127
I will shoot you, Ashley,
if you don't invite him here...

676
00:51:46,207 --> 00:51:48,855
...right now.

677
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,460
Sorry, kiddo.

678
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,055
I'm not involving anyone else
in your bullshit.

679
00:52:01,507 --> 00:52:03,055
Fine.

680
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,393
God, please don't pick up. Please
don't pick up. Please don't pick up.

681
00:52:12,473 --> 00:52:14,860
Please don't pick up. Please don't pick up.

682
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,388
No, not again with the duct tape.

683
00:52:18,407 --> 00:52:20,621
1,001 uses for duct tape.

684
00:52:26,907 --> 00:52:29,168
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Jeremy.

685
00:52:29,873 --> 00:52:31,960
<i>Uh, who's this?</i>

686
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,427
I'm actually calling for Ashley.

687
00:52:34,507 --> 00:52:37,357
<i>There's no Ashley here, dude. Wrong number.</i>

688
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,827
Oh, my God, what a moron!

689
00:52:41,907 --> 00:52:44,188
I can't believe you dated this guy.

690
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,160
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Jeremy, don't hang up.

691
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,992
I'm here with Ashley.
She wants to talk to you...

692
00:53:06,072 --> 00:53:08,180
- ...but not on the phone.
- <i>Who is this?</i>

693
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:12,327
She's being all weird.
I think she wants you to come over.

694
00:53:12,407 --> 00:53:16,093
- She's babysitting me and...
- <i>Is this that little taint on Claremont?</i>

695
00:53:22,773 --> 00:53:24,360
- Yes.
- <i>Tell her to stay there.</i>

696
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,478
- <i>I'm coming over right now.</i>
- Okay, come around the back.

697
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,635
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

698
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,473
Luke. Luke, listen to me, okay?
You don't know what you're doing.

699
00:53:41,553 --> 00:53:43,927
If you don't stop,
someone's going to get hurt.

700
00:53:44,007 --> 00:53:46,893
Don't you remember
when you killed Garrett's hamster?

701
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:50,588
You cried when you told me about it.
You were sad.

702
00:53:59,673 --> 00:54:01,721
It wasn't an accident.

703
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,921
As if.

704
00:54:04,386 --> 00:54:05,852
Say it, you grease monkey loser.

705
00:54:05,932 --> 00:54:09,127
You actually think Ashley's
gonna remember you in a year?

706
00:54:09,207 --> 00:54:13,452
Whatever you just said,
say it again, I fucking dare you.

707
00:54:14,903 --> 00:54:17,988
I said... I need the bathroom.

708
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,825
Gross! Stop it!

709
00:54:33,073 --> 00:54:34,921
Fucking mongo!

710
00:54:52,643 --> 00:54:56,693
- God, I'm getting us out of here.
- Ash, as soon as you're free, you run.

711
00:54:56,773 --> 00:54:59,788
I'm serious, don't turn back.
I can handle myself.

712
00:55:00,907 --> 00:55:02,988
Listen. Keep cutting.

713
00:55:05,173 --> 00:55:08,527
Look, I know you've been avoiding me 'cause
you've got this whole future planned out.

714
00:55:08,607 --> 00:55:12,227
You know, you got college, you got a career.

715
00:55:12,307 --> 00:55:14,860
The kid's right. I don't have those things.

716
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,188
I just want you to know I'm happy for you.

717
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,521
You're gonna be awesome.

718
00:55:23,473 --> 00:55:25,755
He's coming. Hurry!

719
00:55:33,273 --> 00:55:35,721
Dude, your piss reeks.

720
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,031
Reeky. What the fuck you been eating?

721
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:47,180
Jeremy lives, like,
30 minutes away, right? Ugh!

722
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,755
We've got time to kill.

723
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:06,621
Fuck!

724
00:56:07,307 --> 00:56:09,627
Yeah, fuck!

725
00:56:09,707 --> 00:56:13,893
I want to watch the two of you fuck.

726
00:56:13,973 --> 00:56:17,267
- Listen, you little shit...
- No, you listen to me.

727
00:56:17,347 --> 00:56:20,800
- I got the gun.
- Just let him play big boy. He likes that.

728
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,320
Ashley says she's a virgin, but I bet you
hit that shit twice a day, right, Reeky?

729
00:56:32,207 --> 00:56:33,927
You haven't?

730
00:56:34,007 --> 00:56:36,421
Well, tonight's your night, guys.

731
00:56:36,907 --> 00:56:39,321
I'm just kidding.

732
00:56:39,907 --> 00:56:41,827
God, relax.

733
00:56:41,907 --> 00:56:43,788
I'm not a pervert.

734
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:54,911
It's not piss.

735
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,760
Garrett, what the fuck!

736
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,513
What, man? You told me to calm down.

737
00:57:03,593 --> 00:57:05,727
Nobody's smoking weed in the house!

738
00:57:05,807 --> 00:57:08,593
Well, like, next time be more specific.

739
00:57:08,673 --> 00:57:11,327
You moron! My mom's gonna kill me!

740
00:57:11,407 --> 00:57:13,427
Stop bossing me around.

741
00:57:13,507 --> 00:57:15,160
- Give it to me.
- No.

742
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,927
- Give it. Hey! Give it to me!
- No.

743
00:57:19,007 --> 00:57:22,621
- Hurry up!
- I am. Shit!

744
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,374
- Puff.
- No, man. I don't fuck with that shit.

745
00:57:29,454 --> 00:57:31,093
Luke, just...

746
00:57:31,173 --> 00:57:34,660
Garrett, both of you guys, okay,
can we just talk and relax?

747
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,627
I feel like there's a solution
that can make everybody happy.

748
00:57:37,707 --> 00:57:41,527
You're right. We all just need to relax.

749
00:57:41,607 --> 00:57:44,393
Ricky, you first.

750
00:57:44,473 --> 00:57:48,034
- I said no.
- Do you want a hit from the joint...

751
00:57:48,114 --> 00:57:49,970
- ...or a hit from the gun?
- Luke, stop it!

752
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,055
I'm giving him a choice.

753
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,455
- Whoa!
- That's awesome!

754
00:58:11,473 --> 00:58:13,223
Hey, stop it!

755
00:58:13,303 --> 00:58:15,593
What are you doing? Stop!

756
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,097
The house smells like marijuana
so I need to get it in his system.

757
00:58:19,177 --> 00:58:21,625
- What do you mean, "In his system"?
- Garrett, come here. Help me pull.

758
00:58:21,705 --> 00:58:23,788
Where are you taking him?

759
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,355
Stay there, smoke up.

760
00:58:39,507 --> 00:58:41,755
Dude, why do you hang out with this guy?

761
00:58:42,673 --> 00:58:44,488
Because he's my best friend.

762
00:58:45,807 --> 00:58:49,228
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

763
00:58:53,273 --> 00:58:54,693
You painting something?

764
00:58:54,773 --> 00:58:58,588
We're gonna see who's right
once and for all, MythBusters style.

765
00:59:16,007 --> 00:59:20,688
Hey, Garrett, in Scouts, were clove hitches
clockwise or counter-clockwise?

766
00:59:21,807 --> 00:59:25,488
- Clove who?
- Never mind. Got it.

767
00:59:26,123 --> 00:59:27,955
Got what?

768
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Dude, what the fuck is going on?
- Dude...
...I have no idea.

769
00:59:39,807 --> 00:59:43,760
- Whoa! What the fuck, man?
- Oh, you're fucking Home Aloning him?

770
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,327
- Dude, what are you doing, man?
- Please, let me out of this.

771
00:59:46,407 --> 00:59:49,297
- Is it level with his head?
- What are you doing? You're gonna kill him!

772
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,593
- Just stop it.
- Garrett. Garrett, right?

773
00:59:51,673 --> 00:59:53,293
- Yeah. Okay.
- Please untie me.

774
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:56,293
You said that the paint can
would knock him back, like in the movie.

775
00:59:56,373 --> 01:00:00,517
Okay, I take it back. Everything I said,
I'm sorry. You win. Just stop it, please.

776
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,655
Let's just try it one more time.

777
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,588
Ashley!

778
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,388
Oh, shit!

779
01:00:12,507 --> 01:00:14,427
- Blindfold him.
- No, no way, man.

780
01:00:14,507 --> 01:00:18,260
Dude, stop, man, stop! This is fucked!

781
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:20,660
Garrett, I'm warning you.

782
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,788
Blindfold him.

783
01:00:24,573 --> 01:00:26,793
Listen, man, whatever it is, I'm sorry.

784
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,300
All right? Luke, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for hitting you, man.

785
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:33,388
- Make sure it's good and tight.
- You don't have to do this, guys!

786
01:00:33,873 --> 01:00:36,143
You are fucking insane!

787
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,688
- Ashley!
- Oh, fuck it!

788
01:00:39,423 --> 01:00:41,027
Ashley!

789
01:00:41,107 --> 01:00:43,527
Put it down, or I will shoot you!

790
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:45,893
Thank God, Ashley, thank God.

791
01:00:45,973 --> 01:00:49,288
- I said, put it down!
- Okay.

792
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,893
Oh, my God!

793
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:28,260
Holy shit, his head!
His head... it just exploded!

794
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,867
I told you, Garrett. I told you!

795
01:01:32,007 --> 01:01:34,021
Why are you laughing?

796
01:01:35,307 --> 01:01:37,327
I said, why are you laughing?

797
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,627
Because you can't shoot me, Ash.

798
01:01:40,007 --> 01:01:42,327
Don't come any closer, I mean it.

799
01:01:46,507 --> 01:01:49,988
A responsible parent always
keeps the ammo separate.

800
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:55,288
Garrett, get her!

801
01:01:56,007 --> 01:01:58,405
If she gets away, we're both dead!

802
01:02:14,407 --> 01:02:17,180
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck!

803
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,793
- Hey, hey! Please, please!
- No! No!

804
01:02:19,873 --> 01:02:23,390
Hey, hey, just come back.
Just come back. Oh, hey! Fuck!

805
01:02:25,207 --> 01:02:27,633
Get off of me, you crazy fuck!

806
01:02:28,673 --> 01:02:31,327
- Hey!
- Get away from me!

807
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,127
Please. Please!

808
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,427
- No!
- It would make everything easier, please!

809
01:02:35,507 --> 01:02:37,227
Let go!

810
01:02:37,307 --> 01:02:39,855
Ow! What the fuck?

811
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:49,961
No, no, no, no, no, Ashley! Ashley!
Ashley! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

812
01:02:53,797 --> 01:02:56,527
<i># Filling the air, oh, how they pound,
raising the sound...</i>

813
01:02:56,607 --> 01:02:58,193
Help!

814
01:02:58,573 --> 01:03:00,127
Help!

815
01:03:00,727 --> 01:03:03,760
<i># People sing songs of good cheer,

- Oh, thank you, that was wonderful!
- Thank you!

833
01:04:04,792 --> 01:04:08,060
- Hope the cocoa keeps your guys warm!
- Have a good night. Merry Christmas.

834
01:04:15,573 --> 01:04:18,360
There's a couple of new folks
in the group this year.

835
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,088
Really improved their harmonizing.

836
01:04:22,907 --> 01:04:26,121
Oh, look who's awake.

837
01:04:28,773 --> 01:04:32,333
Tough break, Ash.
The carolers are gone, and...

838
01:04:32,713 --> 01:04:34,988
...the Lingards next door?

839
01:04:35,373 --> 01:04:37,421
Well, they're in Florida.

840
01:04:39,107 --> 01:04:41,155
I got rid of Ricky for you.

841
01:04:44,473 --> 01:04:48,175
It hurts now, but you'll thank me later.

842
01:04:55,473 --> 01:04:57,460
You like that?

843
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:59,160
Mmm-hmm.

844
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,888
Why did you kill him?

845
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:21,460
Correction. You killed him
by smoking pot in the house.

846
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,693
That weed is evidence. You wanna go to jail?

847
01:05:24,773 --> 01:05:27,127
It was a fucking joint, dude.

848
01:05:27,207 --> 01:05:29,060
You didn't have to kill someone.

849
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:32,755
Garrett, we are going to get out of this.

850
01:05:37,273 --> 01:05:40,327
Remember when you ditched
fourth period and got caught?

851
01:05:41,507 --> 01:05:45,521
Who convinced them that you stopped
some vandals in the locker room?

852
01:05:46,407 --> 01:05:48,093
Me.

853
01:05:48,173 --> 01:05:51,427
When my mom caught us
stealing from her purse...

854
01:05:51,507 --> 01:05:54,121
...who faked sleepwalking
so you could slip out?

855
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:58,493
- Say it.
- This is so much bigger.

856
01:05:58,573 --> 01:06:02,793
Dude, I am the Harry Houdini
of getting away with it.

857
01:06:02,873 --> 01:06:06,693
I know how tonight plays out,
and we get out clean.

858
01:06:06,773 --> 01:06:08,793
You just gotta do what I say.

859
01:06:09,273 --> 01:06:10,821
Okay?

860
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,188
I said, okay?

861
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,793
- Yeah.
- Good.

862
01:06:24,873 --> 01:06:26,688
Now, watch this.

863
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:31,155
Ashley is going to make a post.

864
01:06:31,873 --> 01:06:35,355
Something simple, like...

865
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:42,393
"Why can't exes just go away?
Jeremy is, like, freaking me out!"

866
01:06:45,457 --> 01:06:49,643
Now, all you gotta do is make sure
she stays quiet while I deal with Jeremy.

867
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:54,093
Deal with him? You mean kill him?

868
01:06:54,173 --> 01:06:57,388
Of course not! God, Garrett. Just...

869
01:06:58,107 --> 01:07:00,188
...we'll just plant a little seed.

870
01:07:01,073 --> 01:07:05,321
And after that, we'll get the paint off you
'cause you look like a fucking hot dog.

871
01:07:13,273 --> 01:07:14,927
I don't want to know.

872
01:07:15,307 --> 01:07:16,993
Garrett, please.

873
01:07:17,073 --> 01:07:19,555
Whatever it is, just please stop.

874
01:07:29,507 --> 01:07:31,055
Hmm.

875
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:36,793
Hey.

876
01:07:36,873 --> 01:07:38,893
Hey, Ash. Hey.

877
01:07:38,973 --> 01:07:43,060
Hey, it's good to see you.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah!

878
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:47,560
We all good, yeah. Yeah, we cool.

879
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:51,027
We're cool. Mmm, mmm, mmm!

880
01:07:51,107 --> 01:07:55,493
Yeah, we cool! Fuck yeah! Yeah!

881
01:07:55,573 --> 01:07:57,121
Yeah!

882
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:03,060
Ash! Ashley!

883
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:08,188
Fuck! What the fuck is that?

884
01:08:09,437 --> 01:08:10,971
Ashley!

885
01:08:12,007 --> 01:08:13,451
Ashley?

886
01:08:18,273 --> 01:08:19,821
Ashley?

887
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,493
Ashley!

888
01:08:28,673 --> 01:08:31,427
Shh! Please.

889
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,093
Ashley?

890
01:08:34,307 --> 01:08:37,588
Please be quiet, please be quiet.
Please. Please be quiet.

891
01:08:37,668 --> 01:08:39,535
Ashley, come on.

892
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:44,088
Ashley.

893
01:08:47,473 --> 01:08:49,721
- Ashley.
- Hi.

894
01:08:51,073 --> 01:08:55,160
Holy shit, man.
You scared the fuck out of me.

895
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,370
- Where is she?
- Inside.

896
01:08:57,450 --> 01:09:00,460
- Okay, cool.
- Wait.

897
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:04,388
- What?
- Just slow down. Come here.

898
01:09:04,873 --> 01:09:06,468
Have a seat.

899
01:09:08,007 --> 01:09:12,060
- No. Where's Ashley, dude?
- She's coming. Chill out.

900
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,188
She's just asked me
to come talk to you first.

901
01:09:32,807 --> 01:09:34,655
I just want tonight to be over.

902
01:09:53,107 --> 01:09:55,387
What the hell's that?
You said she wanted to see me.

903
01:09:55,467 --> 01:09:57,688
- She wants you to apologize.
- For what?

904
01:09:57,798 --> 01:10:01,027
- Shh! Don't wake the neighbors.
- I could give a fuck!

905
01:10:01,107 --> 01:10:03,460
A fuck about the fucking neighbors.

906
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:05,755
She said that you'd know.

907
01:10:08,173 --> 01:10:10,725
Fine. Where is she? I'll apologize.

908
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,351
She wants you to write it down.

909
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,455
This is so fuckin' stupid.

910
01:10:29,707 --> 01:10:33,060
"Dear, Ashley.

911
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:36,155
"I'm sorry."

912
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,393
- That's it?
- What?

913
01:10:47,473 --> 01:10:49,360
What do you want me to say?

914
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,927
I'm just asking, is that it?

915
01:10:52,507 --> 01:10:54,988
Should I go tell her you're done?

916
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,255
Here, fuck.

917
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:07,855
Shit.

918
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,288
"Ashley.

919
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:23,788
"I am so sorry."

920
01:11:28,607 --> 01:11:31,493
- I don't know why I'm doing this.
- Because you're a good person, okay?

921
01:11:31,573 --> 01:11:35,060
And you didn't know any better and you
didn't know what he was capable of.

922
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:39,727
Just untie me, okay? We'll run across
the street and we'll call the cops.

923
01:11:39,807 --> 01:11:41,893
But Luke will freak out
if he finds that you're gone.

924
01:11:41,973 --> 01:11:45,221
He won't hurt you. Okay? I won't let him.

925
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,727
- He's my best friend.
- No, he's not.

926
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:54,993
Luke doesn't give a shit about you, Garrett.
He uses you, he manipulates you.

927
01:11:55,073 --> 01:11:57,521
No friend would put you through tonight.

928
01:12:00,573 --> 01:12:03,221
There, she wants Shakespeare?

929
01:12:07,807 --> 01:12:09,321
Kid?

930
01:12:10,673 --> 01:12:12,488
I'm done!

931
01:12:14,407 --> 01:12:16,293
Hey, kid, where'd you...

932
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:18,127
Fucking cat!

933
01:12:18,207 --> 01:12:20,288
Hey, kid, where'd you...

934
01:13:29,873 --> 01:13:32,693
- Ah! Ow!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

935
01:13:32,773 --> 01:13:36,255
I'm gonna... I'm gonna fix this, okay?
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

936
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm really sorry, Ashley.

937
01:13:43,807 --> 01:13:46,430
I just wish I'd had the balls to step up...

938
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:54,121
I told you not to touch her, you asshole!

939
01:13:56,207 --> 01:13:58,060
You shot...

940
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:01,393
- You shot me.
- Look what you made me do!

941
01:14:01,473 --> 01:14:03,627
I'm... I'm dying.

942
01:14:03,707 --> 01:14:07,640
Why did you make me do it?
Why did you make me do it?

943
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,553
Help! Help!

944
01:14:10,633 --> 01:14:14,401
- Help! Help!
- Shut up!

945
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:21,188
I want my mom...

946
01:14:23,707 --> 01:14:26,193
Fuck! Fuck you!

947
01:14:26,273 --> 01:14:29,555
Fuck you! Fuck you!

948
01:14:29,635 --> 01:14:32,027
Fuck! Shit!

949
01:14:32,107 --> 01:14:33,488
Fuckin' hell.

950
01:14:45,573 --> 01:14:47,788
He was starting to annoy me anyway.

951
01:15:02,173 --> 01:15:04,655
You were never going to let me go, were you?

952
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:08,255
Guilty.

953
01:15:16,207 --> 01:15:20,255
I remember, my mom used to tuck me in.

954
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:24,312
I'd hold onto her and never let go.

955
01:15:26,073 --> 01:15:27,921
She felt so safe.

956
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,121
I'd just fall asleep.

957
01:15:36,707 --> 01:15:38,588
Then she stopped.

958
01:15:40,373 --> 01:15:42,227
I don't know why.

959
01:15:42,607 --> 01:15:44,364
And now...

960
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,415
...I don't sleep well anymore.

961
01:15:58,373 --> 01:16:00,855
I know exactly why she stopped.

962
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:06,455
Why?

963
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:15,571
Why?

964
01:16:16,007 --> 01:16:19,855
Open your eyes. Ashley, open your eyes.

965
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:25,255
Just answer the question! Look at me!

966
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:30,821
Tell me I'm fucked up.
Tell me you're disappointed!

967
01:16:32,373 --> 01:16:35,988
Tell me you're scared or you
wanna go home. Say something!

968
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,788
Ashley.

969
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:44,855
Ashley.

970
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:53,018
Please... say something.

971
01:17:28,373 --> 01:17:29,921
Goodnight.

972
01:19:11,673 --> 01:19:13,955
Shit, the hole in his cheek.

973
01:19:40,224 --> 01:19:41,788
Fuck!

974
01:19:43,673 --> 01:19:45,255
Fuck!

975
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:11,888
What the... shit. Shit.

976
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,288
Fuckin' deers!

977
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:25,027
It wasn't even funny, and Chantal and Dave...

978
01:20:25,107 --> 01:20:28,760
...could not stop talking about how
awful it was. I was so embarrassed.

979
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,293
Oh, dude, they're just being cunts.

980
01:20:30,373 --> 01:20:32,138
- They're what?
- Nothing.

981
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,755
Are we talking about some sort...

982
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:56,821
We're not talking about sex, are we?
'Cause after this meal, I feel bloated.

983
01:21:28,773 --> 01:21:32,127
Oh, my God, where's Lucas? Oh, my God!

984
01:21:32,207 --> 01:21:33,755
Lucas!

985
01:21:35,107 --> 01:21:37,483
Lucas! Lucas!

986
01:21:56,773 --> 01:21:58,586
What's going on?

987
01:21:59,025 --> 01:22:02,460
I got you. I got you.

988
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,121
It's an unspeakable tragedy.

989
01:22:06,407 --> 01:22:09,260
Do any of the parents know? Have they
been made aware? Garrett's parents?

990
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:12,221
I was speaking to Garrett's
father just last week.

991
01:22:13,073 --> 01:22:14,927
Is there going to be a grief councilor?

992
01:22:15,007 --> 01:22:17,221
We'll arrange one for you, sir.

993
01:22:18,807 --> 01:22:21,127
This one's still alive!

994
01:22:21,207 --> 01:22:25,455
Okay, wait. Okay, honey,
just stay here, okay? Just stay here.

995
01:22:33,007 --> 01:22:35,088
Vitals are holding.

996
01:22:36,607 --> 01:22:39,793
- What have we got?
- Stab wound to the neck.

997
01:22:39,873 --> 01:22:42,360
She put duct tape on to stem the bleeding.

998
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,088
Smart girl. Saved her life.

999
01:22:56,507 --> 01:22:58,355
Let's go.

1000
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:03,193
Mom, I'm worried about Ashley.

1001
01:24:03,273 --> 01:24:05,825
I think we should go to the hospital.
