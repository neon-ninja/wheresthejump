00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:21,730
- Hello.
- [Mans Voice] Wanna have a little fun?

2
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,846
- Who's this?
- Tell me your name and I'll tell you mine.

3
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:26,804
I don't think so. [Farts]

4
00:00:26,884 --> 00:00:29,721
- What's that noise?
- Oops. I farted.

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,917
- I didn't think you would hear me.
- No, that popping noise.

6
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:36,593
Oh. I'm making popcorn.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.

7
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:40,228
- Ooh. What is it?
- It's just a scary movie.

8
00:00:40,348 --> 00:00:42,226
- Do you like scary movies?
- Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:45,422
- What's your favorite?
- Mm, I don't know.

10
00:00:45,502 --> 00:00:47,341
Think.

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,816
Oh, I know. Um, Kazaam,
the one where Shaq plays a genie.

12
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:54,132
- That's not a horror movie.
- Well, you haven't seen Shaq act.

13
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:55,811
[Popping]

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,886
- Hey, you have a nice voice.
- Thanks.

15
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:01,044
You never did tell me your name.

16
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:03,282
Why do you wanna know my name?

17
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:05,958
Cause I wanna know
who I'm looking at.

18
00:01:07,597 --> 00:01:09,634
What--
What did you say?

19
00:01:09,714 --> 00:01:11,872
Nice breasts.

20
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:13,789
Look, what do you want?

21
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,467
I wanna see
what your insides look like.

22
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:18,863
Well-- Well, then,
turn to page 54.

23
00:01:18,943 --> 00:01:20,502
Oh.

24
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,419
Hey, nice.

25
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:28,132
Listen, asshole, you've had your fun,
now you better stop or else.

26
00:01:28,252 --> 00:01:31,169
- Or else what?
- Or else my boyfriends
gonna be here any minute,

27
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,247
and he's black
and he'll kick your ass.

28
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,165
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:37,282
You mean the one who wears makeup
and dresses like a woman?

30
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:40,279
- How did you know?
- Turn the porch lights on.

31
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:49,147
Help! Help!

32
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:53,503
Oh, that's not my boyfriend.
I mean, I've fucked him a couple
of times, but that's it.

33
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:56,699
- [Squealing] 
- Look, I'm calling the cops.

34
00:01:56,779 --> 00:01:58,896
Go ahead. Call the cops.

35
00:01:58,976 --> 00:02:01,893
But you might wanna
check the back door first.

36
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:03,930
You forgot to lock it.

37
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,717
[Doorbell Chimes]

38
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:27,862
Take that, you psycho!

39
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:30,819
[Groaning]

40
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:32,976
I cant feel my legs.

41
00:02:33,057 --> 00:02:35,454
I think my arm is broken.

42
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:38,970
- Sorry.
- I want my mommy.

43
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:43,725
Hello, Drew.

44
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:02,302
Oh, God!

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
[Screams]

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

47
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:03,830
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Ugh!

48
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,428
Daddy!

49
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:08,745
- Daddy!
- [Groans]

50
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:11,822
Daddy, no! No!

51
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:16,576
- Did you hear something?
- No, I didn't hear anything.

52
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:31,199
[Keyboard Clicking]

53
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,116
[Rustling]

54
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:46,621
[Screams] Bobby, what are you doing?
My dads in the other room.

55
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:49,257
It just occurred to me. I never
climbed through your window before.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Now that you got it out of your system,
Bobby, you have to leave.
Why?
Shh. Come on.

57
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,287
What's going on in there?

58
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:01,523
Ow! Daddy's head is stuck.
Unstick Daddy's head.

59
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:04,479
- [Groaning] 
- Dad, can you knock?

60
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:08,834
- Knock?
I thought I heard screaming in here.
- No. No, you didn't, Dad.

61
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:11,431
Well, it could've been that crack
I smoked earlier, I guess.

62
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,310
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's what it was.

63
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:15,348
I gotta leave town
for a couple of days.

64
00:05:15,468 --> 00:05:18,104
No big deal. Just that new business
I started with those Colombian guys?

65
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,861
- Oh, you mean Uncle Escobar.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

66
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:23,218
Well, there's a problem.
Some money went missing.

67
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:25,256
And apparently,
some legs are gonna get broken.

68
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:27,653
It's just better if I lay low
for a couple of days.

69
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:30,050
- If the cops raid the place--
- I never heard of you.

70
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,407
- And don't forget--
- To flush your stash.

71
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:35,204
Oh, you are my little girl.
I love you so much...

72
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:37,241
that I left you a little something
in the coffee can.

73
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:40,797
- Dad--
- But you have to remember to step
on it before you sell it.

74
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:43,713
- Now, what are you
gonna cut it with?
- Um, baking--

75
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:45,632
Baking soda.
Not baking powder.

76
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:48,628
Because baking powder guys
will have muffins growing
out of their nose.

77
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:50,865
You love that joke,
don't you, honey?

78
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:54,022
You've loved that joke
since you were two years old.

79
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:56,139
- Okay, well--
- Okay, I love you.

80
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:58,137
- I love you.
- Have a good trip.

81
00:05:58,217 --> 00:06:00,574
- Bye.
- Bye. Whew!

82
00:06:00,655 --> 00:06:02,771
Is the coast clear?

83
00:06:02,851 --> 00:06:05,888
Oh, Cindy, that nightgown.

84
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:09,045
That was close. God!

85
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,795
I was, uh, home watching
The Exorcist, and it
got me thinking about you.

86
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:20,830
If this is about the time
I puked green slime
and masturbated with a crucifix--

87
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,028
It was my first keg party, Bobby.

88
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:27,422
No. No. Uh, it was edited for TV.
All the good stuff was cut out.

89
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:30,299
So you thought you would just climb
through my window...

90
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,336
and we would
play bump-bump?

91
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:34,415
I was kind of hoping
to get my balls licked,

92
00:06:34,535 --> 00:06:37,092
but I wouldn't wanna break
your little underwear rule,
now, would I?

93
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:40,367
So maybe just some
on-top-of-the-clothes type stuff?

94
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:46,321
Okay. But just for a minute.

95
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:54,352
[Soft Rock]

96
00:07:00,983 --> 00:07:03,181
What the--

97
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:05,139
Wrong set.

98
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:12,010
Bobby! Oh, Bobby!

99
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:15,087
I don't wanna wait
for our lives to be over

100
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:17,245
- No, Bobby, don't.
- Ow!

101
00:07:19,402 --> 00:07:22,079
Jeez.

102
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,636
Yeah, my dad.

103
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:29,630
Okay, stud,
you have to go now.

104
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:34,864
Oh, um,
about the sex stuff?

105
00:07:34,984 --> 00:07:37,222
I was only half serious.
I don't wanna rush you or anything.

106
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:40,457
Hey, would you settle
for PG-13?

107
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:43,054
What's that?

108
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:45,611
Oh, jeez!

109
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,169
-[Crash] 
- Good night, Bobby.

110
00:07:53,323 --> 00:07:56,359
- [Laughing] 
- Shorty, you are so loud.

111
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,036
And make sure you take
your behind to class today.

112
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:02,272
- I do be going to class.
- Lunch is not a class, Shorty.

113
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:04,549
It is when you got
the munchies.

114
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:08,385
- See, that's why
you such a dumb-ass.
- Your mother.

115
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:12,300
You my brother.
That's your mother too, jackass.

116
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,536
Oh, yeah.
Well, then, your fathers stupid.

117
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:18,094
So? I don't know him.

118
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:20,930
Yeah, me neither.

119
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,645
- Hey, girl, you ready?
- Yeah, in a minute.

120
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:28,801
- We're gonna be late.
- Wait. There's Buffy.

121
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:32,117
[Grunts] I don't know why
you hang out with her.

122
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:34,434
- She is such a ho.
- Why do you say that?

123
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:36,991
Cause I've seen her.

124
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:39,788
- My friend Sean
had a pool party this summer.
- Sean?

125
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:41,786
You know, Puff Daddy?

126
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:44,302
Anyway, everybody was drinking
Cristal champagne.

127
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:47,339
And then it started to get wild,
and people were getting freaky
in the pool and stuff.

128
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,375
I look over and there was
your girl getting buck wild
in the Jacuzzi.

129
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:53,013
So?

130
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:56,089
With a backup dancer.

131
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:58,047
I mean, that's nasty.

132
00:08:58,127 --> 00:09:00,205
That's-That's lower
than the security guard.

133
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:04,000
At least security can get you backstage.
She don't love herself.

134
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:07,196
Bye, Daddy.
- I don't know. II think
Buffy's sweet, Brenda.

135
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:10,513
She is as fake
as Press-onnails.

136
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,829
Hey, baby girl!

137
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,305
What is up,
my sister?

138
00:09:16,386 --> 00:09:18,902
- Bye, Mr. Gilmore.
- Bye!

139
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:20,701
- Is he gone?
- Yep.

140
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:25,655
Do you like what you see

141
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,091
It's all about the money

142
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:30,010
[Girl] 
Hey, Cindy!

143
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:35,883
- I love this color.
- Let me see that.

144
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,396
- Oh, you guys should
not use this brand.
- Why not?

145
00:09:41,476 --> 00:09:44,314
- Because they test
their products on animals.
- So?

146
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:48,788
Look, have you seen what they do
to those poor animals?

147
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:54,181
Well, I am much more
of a people person.

148
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:57,417
I'd like to feed all the hungry,
little children of the world.

149
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,934
Id much rather help my fellow man
than some animal.

150
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:01,852
- Spare a dollar?
- Get away from me, you bum!

151
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:04,529
Buffy! Can't you see
he's just hungry?

152
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:07,446
Here you go, sir.
A nice sandwich.

153
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:11,881
- See?
- I said a dollar, bitch!

154
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,159
Ow!

155
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,234
God.
Look at this place.

156
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:19,632
It's a circus.

157
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:24,227
Hello. I'm Gail Hailstorm, author of 
the book, You're Dead, I'm Rich.

158
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:26,463
A small college town
is in shock...

159
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,662
after the unthinkable
has happened:

160
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:31,658
a brutal killing spree
that left one teen dead--

161
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:33,935
- That's it. Two teens dead...
- [Gunshot]

162
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:36,292
and this small town
shaken and stirred.

163
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:39,768
- Its times like these--
- Police are combing
the area for clues.

164
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:42,005
There are no witnesses
available at this time.

165
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,923
There are no suspects
in custody.

166
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,840
Police are asking anyone
to come forward.

167
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,997
Reporting live for Black TV.
White folks are dead and we're
getting the fuck out of here!

168
00:10:49,077 --> 00:10:52,154
Grab your shit
and lets go, motherfucker!

169
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:58,666
Hey, do you think the press is gonna
wanna talk to us?

170
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:03,181
Oh, girl, no. The press
only wants to interview the most
ignorant person they can find.

171
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:06,857
I'm on TV! Oh, shit!
First Cops, now this!

172
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:08,774
Oh, man, I'm gonna be
a star, son!

173
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:13,369
- What can you tell us about Drew?
- Well, she had the fat ass.

174
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:16,325
- I mean, it was like bang!
- How close were you to the victim?

175
00:11:16,405 --> 00:11:18,883
Real close.
Until the roofies wore off.

176
00:11:18,962 --> 00:11:20,920
Then she woke up talking about
pressing charges.

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,038
So I just pulled my tongue
out of her ass and left.

178
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:25,195
What would have been
your last words to Drew?

179
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:28,232
Run, bitch! Run!

180
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:34,504
Hey, yo, dawg.
Does this shirt make me look gay?

181
00:11:34,584 --> 00:11:36,422
No, man.

182
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,496
What about now?

183
00:11:40,577 --> 00:11:42,975
- Nah. Yeah.

Don't forget: elections Tuesday.

Ah! Goddamn it!
Son of a bitch!

00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,721
What's the matter, honey?

188
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,639
My report card.

189
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:01,074
Well, at least
you got one A.

190
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,349
Yeah. I did, huh?

You know what?
That kid is always late.

194
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:14,977

Damn, girl.
Mm-mm-mm.

200
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,063
- Id sure like to get in them pants.
- Really?

201
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:46,620

- She had a brother named Steve?
- Yeah.

209

Long hair, pretty little mouth,
perfect ass?

00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:09,754
- That was her.
- Nah, I was talking about Steve.

211
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,750
Whatever happened
to him?

212
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,628
Do you guys think its strange
that she got killed...

213
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:17,863
exactly one year
after we,

214
00:13:17,943 --> 00:13:20,181
you know,
killed that guy?

215
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:22,538
Hey, Cindy,
that was an accident.

216
00:13:22,617 --> 00:13:24,456

Would you look
at what they're doing?

220
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,831
When are we gonna do
stuff like that, huh?

221
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:47,788
One day.

222
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,346

Oh, I love
when you play with my ass.

It came out of nowhere.

00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:09,823
- Oh, my God, we hit a boot.
- Where's the foot?

261
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:27,482
- No way. I ain't going to jail.
- We have to!

262
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:29,800
Cindy, do you know what they do
to young boys in prison?

263
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,756
And all those sex-starved
convicts just waiting
for a fresh piece of meat.

264
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,793
Hey, you're right, Cindy.
Maybe we should call the police.

265
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,109
[Greg] Oh, yeah,
That's a great idea, Ray.
But what about Brenda, huh?

266
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:40,027
You think she wants
to go to jail?

267
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:42,025
This is manslaughter, okay?
We're all gonna fry for this.

268
00:16:42,105 --> 00:16:45,701

that shit on me, Ray.

- Unnecessary.

272
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,166
-[Brenda] Now you're thinking.
- We'll dump him in the ocean.
- Not the ocean, the pier.

273
00:16:58,286 --> 00:17:00,283
- Guess I'll be leaving now.
-[Greg] That's a great idea.

Well just pretend it never happened.

00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:15,745
You know, like the time we got drunk
and we went down on each other.

280
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,742
- I'll get his arm.
- I'll grab. I'll grab his other arm.
- I'll grab his ass.

281
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:21,978
Well take him down to Williamson Cove
and we'll dump him in there.

The sharks'll take care
of the evidence.

Oh, good, cause I left
my roach clip at home.

Hold on. Hold on. Put him down.
He's heavy. Oh, God.

298
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,170
Okay, look. On three we dump him
over the ledge.

299
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,606
Wait, wait, wait.
Shouldn't we at least check his wallet?

300
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:44,202
- For what?
- Shit, he might have some money.

301
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:47,119
We already committed murder.
We might as well rob his ass.

mention this again.

Yeah, you guys are right.
If we were,

329
00:20:13,857 --> 00:20:18,372
they'd probably cast some dingbat
like Jennifer Love Huge Tits to play me.

330
00:20:18,492 --> 00:20:22,127
Yeah, or they'd cast people
in their late twenties,
early thirties to play us.

-[Bell Rings] 
- Kenny, get the camera ready.

can I get a statement?
- No comment.

333
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:38,149
Damn. Who do I have to screw around here
to get a stupid story?

334

Oh, hi, Doofy. Doofy, listen.
Is there a problem on campus?

342

- No comment. No comment.
- Okay. Okay.

343
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:04,479
You know, you look awfully young
to be a police officer.

344
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:06,955
- I'm 25 and a half years old.
- Ooh!

345
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:09,153
- Yeah, that's this many.

346
00:21:09,273 --> 00:21:11,350
Yeah. That's big.

347
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,948
- Well, you don't look
a day over 12.
- [Chuckles]

348
00:21:14,027 --> 00:21:17,584
Except for the big head
and glazed-over look in your eyes.

349
00:21:17,704 --> 00:21:21,139
- Ooh, was that drool?
- Yeah. I forgot to swallow.

350
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:24,495
Don't worry,
cause I never forget.

- [Farts]

352
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:28,850
- Would you remind me
not to do that again?
- Sorry.

353
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,806
[Man Over P.A.] 
Due to the recent tragedy, the sheriff
and me, your principal,

354
00:21:31,926 --> 00:21:34,244
will be questioning all students
throughout the day.

355
00:21:34,364 --> 00:21:37,121
Wow. Sounds like we've got the makings
of a serial killer on our hands.

356
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:39,837
Yeah, I'm not supposed to say.
It's official police business.

357
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:43,752
Hey, Doofy, what do you say you and I
go inside my van over there...

358
00:21:43,872 --> 00:21:46,429
and, uh, get to know
each other a little better?

359
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:50,145
- Would you like that?
Yeah, that van right there.
- That van?

360
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,622
- [Chuckles] 
- Yeah.

361
00:21:52,703 --> 00:21:56,058
- Yeah, okay, lets go. Come on.
- Oh!

362
00:21:56,178 --> 00:22:00,014
A terrible tragedy
and an unbearable loss.

363
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:04,009
Its days like today
that we need prayer in school.

364
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:08,884
It starts to unravel
the very moral fabric
of our society.

365
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:11,120
Here you go, baby.

366
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,038
Go to your daddy.

367
00:22:13,118 --> 00:22:15,435
Oh!

368
00:22:15,515 --> 00:22:18,512
[Chuckles] 
I'll see you after class.

369
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:20,469
- Sweet!
- All right!

370
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:24,225
Okay, class, who would like to give
their oral presentation first?

371
00:22:24,345 --> 00:22:27,062
- Oh!
- Anybody?

372
00:22:27,182 --> 00:22:30,058

00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,647
- Okay. Can I start?
- Yeah.

375
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:42,843
Okay, my presentation
is on the First Amendment.

376
00:22:42,963 --> 00:22:47,199
And it began on May 25, 1787 in Philly
with George Washington.

377
00:22:47,318 --> 00:22:49,116
And it states, and I quote,

378
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:52,312
When our Founding Fathers argued the passage
of our glorious Constitution--

379
00:22:52,432 --> 00:22:55,309
[Heather Continuing]

380
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:43,333
The First Amendment gives us the right
to say what we want--

381
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:46,249
Oh, shut the fuck up!

382
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:49,486
- So, who's next?
- [Putting]

383
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:52,482
Uh, Cindy Campbell.

384
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:55,718
Isn't she the daughter
of, well, you know--

385
00:23:55,838 --> 00:23:59,235
- Oh, yeah, you know, old Mrs., uh--
- Old Mrs. --

386
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:02,071
[Sheriff] Yeah. Yeah,

Cindy.

390
00:24:13,257 --> 00:24:17,453
Now, Cindy, Sheriff has some questions
that he would like to ask you today.

391
00:24:17,573 --> 00:24:20,929
- What is that... god-awful smell?
- I don't know.

392
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:22,287
I got a poopie.

393
00:24:23,406 --> 00:24:26,203
Did you just say
that you went poopie?

394
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:29,240
- Yeah. It was good.
-[Sheriff] Mm.

395
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:32,315
- Get him out of here.
- Yes.

396
00:24:32,435 --> 00:24:34,833
- Thank you, Doofy.
- [Doofy] Okay.

397
00:24:34,912 --> 00:24:37,270
You should now go back
to Special Ed.

398
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:40,826
- Okay. Salute.
- Maybe a change of underwear, son.

399
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:43,983
- Bye, Doofy.
- Bye, Cindy.

400
00:24:44,102 --> 00:24:46,739

- Fine.

401
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,616
- How are you, Sheriff?
- Bloated, constipated.

402
00:24:49,695 --> 00:24:53,131
Got a boil on my ass
the size of a walnut.
You know, the usual.

403
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:56,007
Cindy, I want to ask you
some questions about Drew Decker.

404
00:24:57,726 --> 00:25:00,363
- I didn't really know her.
- Oh, come on. Sure you do.

405
00:25:00,483 --> 00:25:02,720
No. I mean,
I didn't really know her.

406
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,356
I've been in this game a long time.
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

407
00:25:06,435 --> 00:25:09,792
Tell me about Drew. What
was she like in bed, Cindy?

408
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:13,947
Tried to get you.
Its an old police trick.

409
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:17,463
Its an old police trick.
You didn't fall for it.
Good for you, kid.

- She was such a nice girl.
- Yeah, she used to baby-sit my brother Doofy.

I got one too.

446

- Somebody knows.
- That's bullshit, Cindy.

Someone just trying
to fuck with us.

448
00:27:44,691 --> 00:27:47,208
We have to call
the police, Greg.

449

You call the police,
and I'll kill you myself.

I haven't seen him around.
Is he pissed?

You mean since

think It's me, do you?
- No.

676
00:41:48,585 --> 00:41:50,583
It's just that somebody
did try to kill me.

- And the police said
I scared him away.
- I know. He called me last night.

That my girlfriend would rather
call me a killer than touch me?

682

- Then what is it?

Always wipe front to back.

And remember, never, ever
believe someone...

713

when they tell you
that shaving your pubic hair...

714

will rid you
of crab infestation.

this is a difficult time
for you young ladies.

to come to my office to talk,

on the competition.

Its dark,
It's in the middle of nowhere,

826
00:50:21,027 --> 00:50:23,983
and its where hormone-driven teens
love to come and fool around.

827
00:50:24,064 --> 00:50:27,220
So very likely we're about
to see someone get killed.

Okay, sure enough,
there's a girl in that car,
blouse unbuttoned, all alone.

My boyfriend and I were
just, like, making out...

834
00:50:48,435 --> 00:50:50,711
and then we heard a noise out there,
so he went to go check it,

835
00:50:50,831 --> 00:50:53,109
but-- well, that was,
like, ten minutes ago.

836
00:50:53,229 --> 00:50:57,464
Yeah, yeah. Has it crossed your
little mind that your boyfriend
was probably murdered...

837
00:50:57,584 --> 00:51:00,580
and you're about
to be slaughtered next?

Excuse me. Heather, can you tell us
what you're feeling, honey?

You were in the closet.

to get revenge?

Here, Sheriff.
They wanted me to give this to you.

Bye, Cindy.

Im sorry, Cindy.
It wasn't the man you guys killed.

1203
01:14:30,214 --> 01:14:33,491
His name was David Keegan.
Some fishermen found his body
a few weeks later.

- He's buried in Lakewood Cemetery.
- That's impossible.
- Then I don't know who it could be.
- He's gotta be someone else...

1205
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:44,798
who was connected with all the victims,
someone who knew about the accident.

1206
01:14:44,917 --> 01:14:47,434
Someone who could move around
without being noticed.

1207
01:14:49,672 --> 01:14:52,667
Oh, my God.

- Have you seen Doofy?
- No.

1213
01:15:11,725 --> 01:15:13,843
- Have you seen Doofy?
Has anybody seen Doofy?
- No, Sheriff.

1214
01:15:13,924 --> 01:15:16,320
- No.
- [Man] Yeah.
Just went out the back, Sheriff.

[Sheriff] Doofy!

1216
01:15:31,102 --> 01:15:34,339
He walks alone
under the big city lights

1217
01:15:34,459 --> 01:15:38,016
He always knows
just when the time is right

1218
01:15:38,135 --> 01:15:41,371
He never shows what he's thinking
He keeps it inside

1219
01:15:41,491 --> 01:15:45,047
Because he's
too cool for school

1220
01:15:45,126 --> 01:15:48,483
He comes alive
when the sun goes down

1221
01:15:48,602 --> 01:15:51,919
He gets it right
You know he's always down

1222
01:15:52,039 --> 01:15:55,354
He's got one eye open
and his ear to the ground

1223
01:15:55,474 --> 01:15:58,311
And he's too cool for school

1224
01:16:00,029 --> 01:16:03,345
He's an operator
He's a real player

Yo, if you all watchin'
this tape right now,

1230

I didn't make it.

or worse, dead.

But either way it goes,
I'm gonna tell you all the rules
to survive this situation.

You gotta be quick.

1234

Rule number two:
Don't fall down.

1235
01:16:48,453 --> 01:16:53,287
And rule number three:
Whatever you do, never look back.

1236

You all wish me luck.

1237
