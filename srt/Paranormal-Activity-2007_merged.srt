1
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,432
Hey, babe, what's up?

2
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:52,507
- What is that?
- Hello, baby.

3
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:53,983
Hi.

4
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,654
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yes.

5
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,657
I don't know what you think it is,
but whatever it is, it's sweet.

6
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:04,854
I think it's a giant-ass camera.
What happened to the little handheld?

7
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:06,760
Easy to move around, versatile?

8
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:09,868
Are you gonna park the car or you
gonna stand there looking at me?

9
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,400
This is... big and impressive.

10
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:16,303
And it has a really bright light on it.

11
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:19,002
- Kiss the camera, please.
- I'm not kissing the camera.

12
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,306
How much did this cost you?

13
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:24,075
How much did?
I'll kiss you, not the camera.

14
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,043
Turn that thing...

15
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:32,286
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, see.

16
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,488
You think this'll work?

17
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,857
I think we're gonna have
a very interesting time,

18
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:41,057
capturing whatever paranormal
phenomena is occurring or not occurring.

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,828
Seriously, what'd you
throw down for that?

20
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,700
Well, about half as much
as I made today.

21
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,599
Good thing you're cute. Dinner?

22
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:55,544
- Just keep going up the stairs.
- Oh, my God.

23
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,541
- All right, I'll make dinner.
- Good.

24
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:02,913
No. We're just gonna film
whatever happens to us,

25
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:06,513
and then when any weird shit goes on,

26
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,323
we will be in a perfect position
to capture it for posterity.

27
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,661
Oh, so we can always, like,
look back and remember fondly?

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,268
Well, you know, hopefully,
once we get it on camera,

29
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,871
- we can figure out what's going on.
- OK.

30
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,840
Once we know what's going on,
we can react appropriately.

31
00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:29,011
- And...
- Take it from there.

32
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:33,815
Take care of it, whatever it is.
If it's one of those neighbors,

33
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,818
one of those kids
who's obsessed with you

34
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,549
and is trying to peep through a window
or something at night,

35
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,488
that will take care of them.

36
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:44,426
Unless that kid has been following me
since I was eight years old.

37
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,725
- Something pretty creepy.
- I don't think that's the thing.

38
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:47,855
You're telling me.

39
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:51,498
- You know, I realize that you're...
- Are you all right? Are you OK?

40
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:53,867
Are you doing OK?

41
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,469
- Are you talking to the?
- Are you happy?

42
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,510
Do you have enough batteries?

43
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:02,705
You're supposed to be in love with me,
not the machine.

44
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,412
We are gonna be sleeping
with this camera.

45
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:07,576
- We're gonna what?
- Put it in the bedroom.

46
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,085
All night?

47
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:11,947
You're cute.

48
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:13,688
Yeah.

49
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,295
That was shy. You looked away.

50
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,134
Dinny time.

51
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,674
- Test, audio test.
- This is the last test, right?

52
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,006
Yeah. Can you just please talk, please?

53
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:38,014
Hello, Micah. You're the
best boyfriend in the whole world,

54
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,345
- except for your strange fascination
- Video's good.

55
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,455
- With electronics.
- Katie, say something.

56
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:46,717
- What do you want me to say?
- Something really quiet.

57
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,417
What do you want me to say?

58
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,426
- Whisper.
- I am whispering.

59
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,690
- Can you hear me?
- Whisper.

60
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,891
- I am whispering.
- You're not whispering.

61
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,899
I am whispering now.

62
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,061
That's a whisper,
and I think we caught it on camera.

63
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,470
All right, sweet,
this microphone is worth the cash.

64
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:04,508
All right, we're operational, babe.

65
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:06,704
Sweet!

66
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:12,577
Do you know of any tricks
to make this stuff happen?

67
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:16,484
I don't wanna make...
them, it, whatever...

68
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:18,283
I don't want it to happen at all.

69
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,984
So I don't wanna force it to happen.

70
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:25,254
You know, if it catches something,
great, but I'm not gonna like...

71
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,196
OK. I mean, I'm just saying 'cause
you know, have it on camera

72
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:31,497
would be pretty cool
for a lot of reasons, sweetie.

73
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:32,831
- It would...
- I know.

74
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,736
...substantiate your claims.
- You believe me, right?

75
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,399
Yeah, of course.

76
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:44,672
Hey.

77
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,093
What is that?

78
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,526
Let's investigate it.

79
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,967
We're hearing a weird sound.

80
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,442
You hear it?

81
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,009
Is it the fridge?

82
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,046
It's the icemaker.

83
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,215
Damn it!

84
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,627
It will only come out
when we sleep here.

85
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,495
I'd like to take this moment

86
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:35,623
to illustrate the beauty
of this fine instrument.

87
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,796
I meant her. This is just my guitar.

88
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,132
You're sweet.

89
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,445
- What is this?
- I just like your feet. They're sexy.

90
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,514
I need to repaint my toenails.

91
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:51,445
You shouldn't film my feet.

92
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,246
Sex type thing.
Can I get a little striptease?

93
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,718
Please? Just a half of one.

94
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,018
Just bra and panties.

95
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,822
- No.
- All right. I'll do anything you want.

96
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:04,952
No.

97
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:06,587
Bullshit.

98
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,735
Yeah, the Venus.
Hey, go back in your Venus pose.

99
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,601
No. So where are we gonna put it?

100
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,638
You've got the bathroom or the hallway.

101
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:21,269
I think it should point down the hall,
that's where we heard its footsteps.

102
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:22,675
It's kinda dark.

103
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,608
You can't see me here?

104
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:29,585
- Not at all.
- What if I turn this one on?

105
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:32,155
Yeah, that's good.

106
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,488
- That's cool? Need more light?
- No, I think you're fine.

107
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,687
- All right.
- Come check it out.

108
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,598
What happened with
putting the camera out here?

109
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,201
- We could get...
- It's gotta get old, right?

110
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:51,434
Careful. You're about
to run into the shower.

111
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,340
We could get extracurricular with this.

112
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,844
I mentioned it before.

113
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,177
- We could... but no.
- OK.

114
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,784
Nice try, though.

115
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,717
I just want you to know
I'm crying inside.

116
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,387
I'm putting this thing back.

117
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:10,393
OK, now hook up the FireWire.
Going off.

118
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:16,334
- Is it working?
- It is, or isn't?

119
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,128
Yeah, I think it's good.

120
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,375
Oh, God.

121
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,844
How am I supposed to
sleep with that?

122
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,614
Lt'll be fine.

123
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,172
It's looking at me.

124
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,812
This is what Katie looks like
in the morning.

125
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,842
She is so pretty.

126
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,852
- What do you want for breakfast?
- Whatever. What the hell...

127
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:49,085
"Whatever" isn't an answer.
How about scrambled eggs?

128
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,493
- Sounds pretty good.
- Yeah? Good.

129
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,094
- Hey, babe?
- What?

130
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,000
Did you drop my keys on the floor?

131
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:01,895
Hold on.

132
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,872
My keys are in the middle of the floor.

133
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,034
I just... Look where I found my keys.

134
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,741
- Where did you leave them?
- I left them on the counter.

135
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,544
Are you sure?

136
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,620
Yes. I always leave them in
the same spot, next to your wallet.

137
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:19,482
Obviously, this is
incontrovertible evidence

138
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,618
that evil forces came from beyond
the grave to move your keys.

139
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,491
Make your breakfast.

140
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:31,630
That would be a 3.0 on the splash scale.

141
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,240
- What are you doing up there?
- I'm filming you.

142
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,363
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

143
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:46,384
Very, very mature. I think that's my...

144
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:47,712
I got a big one!

145
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,187
I think that's my favorite quality
in you, it's your maturity.

146
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:56,622
Big day. It's the day of the psychic,
he's coming.

147
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,696
He should be here within the hour.

148
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,595
We're gonna go find Micah
and see how he's feeling about it.

149
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,361
My guess? Very excited.

150
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:09,099
All right, tell me how excited
you are to meet our psychic.

151
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:13,905
- Who will be here within the hour.
- The doctor will be here? Great.

152
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,879
So excited, I can't contain myself.

153
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,985
Can't contain yourself?
Let it all out. Don't be shy.

154
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:26,024
I got something quite appropriate
for your psychic, though, I think.

155
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,150
- What?
- I just, you know, stumbled upon it.

156
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:30,591
Show me.

157
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:33,960
Maybe I'll play this when he gets here.
I think it'll make him feel at home.

158
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:41,672
You are totally not taking
this seriously, are you?

159
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,967
Don't you wanna make him feel at home
and welcome in his own environment?

160
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:47,305
I mean, this way...

161
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:51,780
This is not gonna make him feel at home.
This is gonna make him leave.

162
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,044
We're not gonna insult...
You, not me. You.

163
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,349
Don't you smile like
you're so happy with yourself.

164
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:59,719
How 'bout less music?

165
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,348
That was good.

166
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:04,394
Is the psychic gonna give me some
stock tips while he's here?

167
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,228
Haven't bet on the horses in awhile.

168
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,893
- Maybe if you're good.
- An opinion on the hundred-to-one shot?

169
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:12,367
- Stock?
- I'm done with you.

170
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:15,439
So you'd think a psychic
would be on time.

171
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:20,211
You know, like he could foretell
if the traffic was gonna be bad?

172
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:21,676
You're clever.

173
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,875
Wait, let me get my music.

174
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,814
Don't you even think about
turning that on.

175
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:30,914
- Hi. Dr. Fredrichs?
- Yes. Hi.

176
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:33,115
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Come on in.

177
00:11:33,258 --> 00:11:34,748
- This is Micah.
- Oh, hi. Micah.

178
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:36,087
I'm sorry for the camera.

179
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,594
So can you see ahead of, like,
that kind of thing?

180
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,858
- Like know when traffic's gonna be bad?
- Cut.

181
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,231
Oh, usually it depends on the day
of the week, or the time of the day.

182
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,632
- You know.
- Like all of us.

183
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,673
I never hesitate when somebody
says, "Will you come to San Diego?"

184
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:51,332
I'm always ready to do that.

185
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:55,140
I'm certainly glad you could make the
trip today. We really do appreciate it.

186
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,305
I'd like to spend time
getting to know you,

187
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:00,577
getting a bit more information
than what we shared over the phone.

188
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,914
Getting to know both of you,
what's your life like,

189
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,989
what's your relationship like...

190
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,557
It's good.

191
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,718
- It's good? That's one good step.
- Straight to the point there.

192
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,420
How long have the two of you
been together?

193
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:12,928
- Three years.
- Three years?

194
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,556
We're engaged to be engaged
after she graduates.

195
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,433
- And your jobs? Both your jobs?
- I'm a student.

196
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:22,597
I'm an English major,
hoping to be a teacher soon.

197
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:27,405
I don't know where yet.
Micah is a day trader.

198
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,275
- Yeah.
- How about your health?

199
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:33,710
- We're in good health.
- And no medications involved?

200
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:35,012
- No.
- OK.

201
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,146
More often than not,
things that you've shared with me

202
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,990
can be explained away by simple things,
like squeaky houses or rattling pipes

203
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:47,621
or you know,
some normal thing that's going on

204
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:52,169
that has people more freaked because
they're under a high degree of stress.

205
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:56,866
So... So this...
let's call it a haunting,

206
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,443
has happened to you
before moving into this house.

207
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:04,709
Yes. It started when I was eight.

208
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,217
I, you know,
I lived with my family, of course,

209
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:12,084
and shared a room with my
younger sister, Christi. She was five.

210
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:18,185
And at that time we both, you know,
experienced whatever it was.

211
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,197
We had... I would feel the breathing
and it would wake me up,

212
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,927
and I would wake her up.
And I would see the...

213
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:31,204
I guess you'd call it like the, like
just a mass, like the shadowy figure

214
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,935
that would be at the foot of my bed.

215
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,478
It was always at the foot of my bed,
never at the foot of her bed.

216
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,844
- But she did see it.
- She saw it also?

217
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,419
Absolutely. And we were
both absolutely terrified.

218
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:44,989
- OK.
- I mean, you know, couldn't even move.

219
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:48,820
You know, you just...
It was just... It was horrifying.

220
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:52,089
And we would just pray.
Please, please let it just go away.

221
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,892
And then, eventually, it would.

222
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,728
So this happened for a while
in our first house.

223
00:13:56,868 --> 00:14:00,497
And then we...
There was a fire. We managed...

224
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,405
Everyone got out, no one was hurt,
thank God... Thank goodness.

225
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,104
But we lost everything.
So we moved.

226
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,106
Was it ever determined
what caused the fire?

227
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,945
- No.
- OK.

228
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:17,715
And I... You know, I'm not saying
it had to do with the haunting stuff.

229
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,450
I'm not saying that at all.
I don't know what it was.

230
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:24,028
Did the fire department do any
investigation of the causes of the fire?

231
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:26,460
I don't know if there was
a criminal investigation,

232
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:30,728
but I know that they tried to figure out
what was the cause, and they couldn't.

233
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:33,030
- OK.
- It wasn't electrical or anything,

234
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:35,036
you know, simple like that.

235
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:38,472
So then, from the time you were
eight years old until now,

236
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,704
have you experienced this periodically
over the ensuing years?

237
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:45,510
Yes. From 13 on it's happened,
it's happened periodically.

238
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,087
Over the past few weeks
things have started happening again.

239
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:52,790
So when you tell me that it's moved
from where you were living

240
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:55,188
when you were eight,
again when you were living

241
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,887
someplace else when you were 13,
and now here,

242
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,021
it seems to me that's what
we're dealing with.

243
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,362
Something that's
basically connected to you.

244
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:07,532
These lights have been flickering,
these ones that are in the ceiling.

245
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,734
We've had water from the faucets
turn on and off unexplainably.

246
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,242
- OK.
- Or we'll come down.

247
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:15,437
Not turn on and off,
but we'll come down and it'll be on.

248
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,311
We've heard banging on the walls,
scratching sounds,

249
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:23,285
like, you know, like dragging down
the wall kind of scratches.

250
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,515
Most of the activity is in here,
isn't it?

251
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:27,318
Yes. The vast majority of it.

252
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:29,753
I've heard whispering.

253
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:35,128
Sometimes I can't understand it,
sometimes it's saying my name.

254
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,928
Oh, so it specifically
calls to your name?

255
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,264
- It has before.
- You've heard this too, Micah?

256
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:41,872
Well, I've heard weird noises.

257
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:45,033
I haven't really heard anyone
say Katie's name, except for me.

258
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,735
That might've been me in my sleep.

259
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:50,678
I can tell the difference between you
saying "Katie" from over there in bed

260
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:55,150
and something right here
whispering distinctly in my ear.

261
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,951
Yeah, so, look. And I got like a
FireWire going into my laptop, you know,

262
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,617
we can record all night what...
You want to take this?

263
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,821
Got the tripod, wide angle lens,
get the whole room

264
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:09,422
EVP recorder, just to catch any sounds.

265
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,627
So you'll go to bed
and have the light on

266
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,068
and have the camera going
as you're going to bed.

267
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:18,074
- Is this, do you do this all the time?
- We've just started with the camera.

268
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,110
Our extra bathroom right there.

269
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:23,372
Guest bedrooms.
Lights flickering in here.

270
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,245
Is there something we can do
to make the stuff happen?

271
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,785
- To get it on tape?
- I've told him I don't want to

272
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,354
mess with that. I didn't
want him to get the camera.

273
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,958
These hauntings,
they feed off of negative energy.

274
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:36,424
So if there is something negative
going on here,

275
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:39,223
it will help spur on the haunting.

276
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,855
You know the entity
may feed off of that.

277
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,629
You shouldn't let your mother come
over anymore. She's really mean.

278
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,033
Stop joking, Micah.

279
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,806
My area of expertise
is dealing with ghosts.

280
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,710
That's what I've built my career on,

281
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:00,784
helping people get in touch
with people who have died.

282
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,819
Communicating with ghosts.

283
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:05,320
The spirits of dead human beings.

284
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,448
A demon is something different.

285
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:11,050
That's an entity that relates
to something that is non-human.

286
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,185
OK.

287
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,128
A lot of debate and discussion
about what that could be,

288
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,700
but it's not a person.

289
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,359
- OK.
- OK?

290
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:21,196
Dealing with demons is not my area.

291
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,672
I'm very uncomfortable with it,
and I'll tell you, quite frankly,

292
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,573
I sense there's something going on
in this house.

293
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:30,169
You cannot run from this.
It'll follow you.

294
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,647
It may lay dormant for years.

295
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:35,480
Something may trigger it to get...
become more active,

296
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,886
and it will, over time,
reach out to communicate with you.

297
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,550
OK, I want to give you the name
of Dr. Johann Averies.

298
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:46,721
He's a colleague. He's a demonologist,
he specializes in this sort of thing.

299
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,025
- He's in Los Angeles.
- OK.

300
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:52,068
All right, check this out. What if
we just get this Ouija board, right?

301
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:56,106
We find out what it wants, then we
give it what it wants and then... gone.

302
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,108
Because what it probably wants is Katie.

303
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,441
And if you do pick up a board
and try to play games with it,

304
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,675
the entity will sense that
you're trying to communicate with it,

305
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:08,615
and that's opening the door,
inviting it in.

306
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:11,688
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah, I'm with you.

307
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:17,121
I hope so. You're gonna be fine. OK?

308
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,093
Glad to hear you say that.

309
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,098
Thank you so much for coming.

310
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,931
I will definitely give
Dr. Averies a call.

311
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:29,097
- Have a very safe trip back.
- I will. Bye-bye, both of you.

312
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,210
- Nice to meet you, bye.
- Later. What a fruit!

313
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,108
Do you think you could try not to be
completely rude to him?

314
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,876
I feel like it was good information,
like I'm not nuts.

315
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,383
I feel like at least
we're doing something.

316
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,283
I'm gonna call that guy tomorrow.

317
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:44,581
What guy?

318
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:48,557
- Dr. Johann Averies?
- That demon guy?

319
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,320
- Don't laugh at him.
- No, don't.

320
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,987
Seriously, don't call the guy, OK?
That's insane.

321
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:56,430
- He said to call him tomorrow.
- Babe. Don't call the guy.

322
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,298
No, promise me you're not gonna
call that guy. Please?

323
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:01,302
- Want me to promise?
- I talked with the one dude,

324
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:03,907
I'm not putting up with like a team,
a legion of...

325
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,202
- OK.
...Jesus freaks.

326
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,005
- If it gets worse I'm gonna call him.
- All right.

327
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:12,014
Yeah. You sound way better
when you're brushing your teeth.

328
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:16,218
Have a little extracurricular
activity with this camera?

329
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:17,878
Not with this camera on us, no.

330
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,082
OK, taking the camera off
for ten minutes.

331
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,317
Ten minutes, huh?

332
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:23,586
That's all I need.
I don't know about you.

333
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,560
Let's go to bed. Turn it off.

334
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,360
All right. I'll set up
in the bedroom.

335
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,629
- Turn it off!
- Katie is in the bathroom.

336
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:37,035
- Turn it off. Turn it off!
- Hi, Katie.

337
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,972
I want to pee! Turn it off.

338
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,238
Dr. Johann. I am Dr. Johann.

339
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,575
- OK, I'm about to pee.
- I'm a demonologist.

340
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,775
Go away. I can't hear you,
can't hear you.

341
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:49,887
I'm here to save you from the demons.

342
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,121
Come to bed.

343
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:58,321
I will! Just let me turn
this off... Play time?

344
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,525
Wait!

345
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,569
- Excuse me.
- What?

346
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,366
- The camera's not off.
- It's off. That's the standby light.

347
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:11,100
That's not the standby light.
That's the record light.

348
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:13,267
- Don't lie to me.
- All right.

349
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,206
I think that probably was illegal
in Kentucky and another 12 states.

350
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,916
This girl is a wild animal.

351
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:26,790
What time you
getting up?

352
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,950
Don't know,
six o'clock or so.

353
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,221
Did you set
your alarm?

354
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,895
Sleep good?

355
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,290
Is that the video?

356
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,233
I was looking at the footage
from last night.

357
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,703
Check it out.
This is about 2:10 in the morning.

358
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,970
- The doors...
- A minute.

359
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,167
You got it?

360
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,973
The doors and windows all over the
house are closed. I just checked them.

361
00:21:56,114 --> 00:22:00,107
The flowers are not moving.
But something else is.

362
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,918
- The door's fricking moving by itself.
- Oh, my God.

363
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,992
And it's not over. Check it out.
It moves again.

364
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,622
- Oh, Micah, that is...
- That's impossible.

365
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,998
- I told you this was a good idea.
- Wow.

366
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,273
You think you can get that ghost back?

367
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,399
- Think I can do what?
- Get the ghost back.

368
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:27,704
Get us some more interesting...
you know.

369
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,138
I'm not interested in that.
I just want him to go away.

370
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:44,256
Oh, Micah!
Oh, my God.

371
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,731
What are you doing?
Come here! Come here right now!

372
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,856
What?

373
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,969
It's right there.
It's right there! Get it!

374
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,236
Get rid of it. Please.

375
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,841
You scream like that for a spider?

376
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,945
- Oh, God.
- Jesus.

377
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,139
- Did you go get the camera first?
- Yeah.

378
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,944
I thought it was a ghost
or something like real scary...

379
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,713
I'm nearly losing my mind
and you grab the camera.

380
00:23:09,854 --> 00:23:12,584
Hey, little friend! What's your name?

381
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,820
Can I turn the camera off?
OK. I need to not be around you.

382
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:20,829
- All right. We're going.
- Straight outside. OK.

383
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,198
Hey, you out here?

384
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,975
Hey, tell me what the point of this was.

385
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,283
Was part of your master plan
just to move the door?

386
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,584
Or are you just doing random shit?

387
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:53,028
Well. Basically, it could be two things:

388
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:56,463
It could be a ghost,
or it could be a demon.

389
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,429
Dr. Fredrichs said
that it wasn't a ghost.

390
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,198
- And whatever it is...
- I'm going by the evidence.

391
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,399
I'm doing my research
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

392
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:07,636
Well, whatever it is that's
following me, it doesn't feel...

393
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,047
It doesn't feel human.

394
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:16,119
It feels like a monster.
I mean, like it wants to hurt me.

395
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,620
Well, that sounds
actually like a demon.

396
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:22,351
- Yeah, that's what he said.
- Ghosts are spirits of human beings.

397
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:24,120
Yeah. It's definitely not human.

398
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:28,028
Then maybe you're right,
which is bad, 'cause demons suck!

399
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,397
Basically, they're these
malevolent, evil spirits

400
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:37,304
that only exist to cause pain and
commit evil for their own amusement.

401
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:41,936
It's pretty creepy. I mean, they
stalk people for years, like decades.

402
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,176
They're sometimes really intelligent in
the way they do things to freak you out.

403
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:49,381
So this could be
a really rare phenomenon,

404
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,112
and it's cool we got it on tape.

405
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,054
I'm surprisingly not as excited as you,

406
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,592
considering I'm the one
that's being terrified.

407
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,696
It's all good. We'll take care of it.

408
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,762
I understand that
this stuff is new to you,

409
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:07,634
and exciting in some ways,
so I get your whole filming thing.

410
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,399
But it isn't new to me,

411
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:17,071
and I think this thing
could be very dangerous.

412
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,776
So I just... I just want you
to know that as things get...

413
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,080
...things progress
or get worse in any way,

414
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,985
I don't want to mess with the camera.
Don't want to make it mad.

415
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,786
I understand where you're
coming from, just remember

416
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,225
you didn't exactly warn me
about this stuff

417
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:33,262
- before we moved in together.
- I know.

418
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:36,390
So I think I have
a little bit of say in what we do.

419
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,900
I get that, honestly.
But what was I supposed to say?

420
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,335
On our first date,
"There's a demon that has been foll..."

421
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:44,669
No, but maybe on our
15th date or our 30th date

422
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,868
or when we decided to live together,

423
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:49,673
that might've been
a good thing to bring up.

424
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:53,617
Here.

425
00:26:04,495 --> 00:26:09,194
All right. The windows are locked,
doors are locked, alarm is on.

426
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,434
Anything gets in here,
we're gonna know about it.

427
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,971
I don't think it cares about
alarms and locked doors.

428
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:19,970
It can go wherever it wants,
it can do whatever it wants.

429
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,442
How do you know?

430
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,173
Whatever's happening, it's already here.

431
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,477
All right.

432
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

433
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:02,948
What is this?

434
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,714
What's the matter?

435
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:09,526
I just...
I just had a nightmare.

436
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,030
I'm sorry,
did I scare you?

437
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,898
It's all right,
don't worry about it.

438
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:21,799
- Oh, my God.
- You OK?

439
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:23,031
- Yeah.
- You sure?

440
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
My head.
Did you hear that?

441
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,839
- I'm going down.
- No, no, no, Micah!

442
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,973
Micah, no!

443
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:37,354
Micah,
don't leave me here.

444
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:38,477
Don't leave me here.

445
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,386
Take this.

446
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,993
Where do you think that came from?

447
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,664
- Micah!
- Is anyone down here?

448
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:11,981
- This all you got?
- Oh, Micah, stop!

449
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:15,615
Please don't do that.
Oh, baby, come on.

450
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,737
You OK, baby?

451
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,205
I'm OK.

452
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,334
- You sure?
- I'm still creeped out.

453
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,075
- Hey, girls?
- No, but you know what?

454
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,616
- If you can just show me...
- Hello! Excuse me!

455
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:42,184
I know it's bead time,

456
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,788
but I have a little something
I want to show you guys.

457
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:48,016
Can it wait? We're having
very intense girl time right now,

458
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,889
and we cannot be interrupted
by Micah and his camera.

459
00:28:51,028 --> 00:28:54,054
- Thank you, OK. I understand.
- I need a little break from...

460
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:56,189
What the fuck!
I'm trying to show you guys something.

461
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,358
Hey! You be sweet.

462
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:01,905
All right. This is the tape
from the digital audio recorder

463
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,199
I set up in the bedroom.

464
00:29:04,108 --> 00:29:07,737
This is the tape from about
ten seconds before we woke up.

465
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:17,579
What the hell was that?

466
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:21,453
I listened to it 50 times.
It's not saying anything.

467
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:26,052
It's not a language that I recognize,
it's not a dog, it's not, like,

468
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:28,631
noise from the street,
it's not any kind of

469
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:31,132
electrical interference
that I recognize, so...

470
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,032
- Oh, God!
- What I figure it is...

471
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,139
I think the thing is
right in the bedroom.

472
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,902
This thing wants to communicate.

473
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:42,240
So, I figure I'm gonna go out
and get a Ouija board...

474
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,642
No!

475
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,806
I don't want to know
what this thing has to say.

476
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,612
- I want it to leave us alone.
- Trust me. Bad idea.

477
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,722
He specifically said,
"Don't do anything to antagonize or..."

478
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,017
- Whatever it is.
- Sorry I told you about it.

479
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:56,558
You're going to use a Ouija
board and invite whatever it is in,

480
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:59,094
- and it's not going to go away.
- Let me do my thing.

481
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,564
The camera is your thing.
You do a Ouija board, there's no more.

482
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,898
Nothing. Promise me.
Micah, promise me, please!

483
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,007
Fine! I promise you
I won't buy a Ouija board.

484
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,130
- OK?
- Thank you.

485
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:13,800
Hey, Micah, smile.

486
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:21,547
Hey, we haven't had anything
interesting happen in a while!

487
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,578
- Micah?
- You scared?

488
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,580
What you got?

489
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,693
Put the camera away,
we're going to bed.

490
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,454
- Go back to sleep.
- Come on.

491
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:35,760
- Hey! Don't antagonize...
- What you got? I'm calling you out!

492
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,700
Hey! Hey, that's enough! Micah! Come on.

493
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:43,700
Your demon's worthless.
You're worthless!

494
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:45,536
You got nothing.

495
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:48,042
- Put the camera away.
- OK.

496
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,437
What's up?

497
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:20,271
I just thought
I heard something.

498
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,641
What?
What'd you hear?

499
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,114
Just a thud.

500
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:36,259
- A thud? Where?
- Maybe downstairs.

501
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

502
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:54,940
Fuck.

503
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,879
Where are you going?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

504
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,154
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

505
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,668
Micah, wait, wait, wait, please.

506
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,035
Where'd you go?

507
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:29,238
I'm right here. I'm over here, babe.
I'm over here. Over here.

508
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:36,042
Oh, my God.

509
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,121
Hear that?

510
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,122
Oh, God.

511
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,766
- You OK, baby?
- Yeah.

512
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,632
Oh, God.

513
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,743
It looks like it's gone now,
whatever it was.

514
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,003
OK, come on.

515
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,972
That's video proof
of that noise, though.

516
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,699
Do you hear that?

517
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:40,310
Hold on.

518
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,308
You hear that?

519
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,570
Yeah, I do.
I don't know what that is.

520
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,314
This is really
good stuff, Katie.

521
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,681
I'm telling you. This is, this is the...

522
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:21,281
I hope that guy... it, whatever,
shows us a little more action.

523
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,291
- This is grade-A shit.
- I don't think we should be

524
00:34:24,428 --> 00:34:28,797
messing with this. This is why it
scares me, you don't take it seriously.

525
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,424
I take it seriously.
I think it's pretty...

526
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,628
You have a camera in my face
in the bathroom.

527
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,103
You look beautiful
in the morning, by the way.

528
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,105
Maybe we shouldn't have the camera.

529
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:43,941
Hello. This is really
golden shit. Come on.

530
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:49,951
Not an option, at this point,
with all that cool stuff going on.

531
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:51,952
- Cool?
- Or disturbing.

532
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:55,581
- Are you not scared?
- It's... it's a little bizarre.

533
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:59,423
But we have it documented,
it's gonna be fine, OK?

534
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:04,591
Sounded like it was, like, sounds coming
from the wall or ceiling or something.

535
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,664
- Or the floor.
- Floor? Y'think?

536
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:13,299
Well, whatever it was... Oh, God!

537
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:17,510
Like if someone were to drop
something really, really big and heavy.

538
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,845
Like what? Like someone
picked the couch up or something?

539
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:25,778
You know, that kind of stuff
didn't happen to me before the camera.

540
00:35:27,324 --> 00:35:29,485
- Before what?
- Before the camera.

541
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,658
- That has nothing to do with it.
- It's getting worse.

542
00:35:32,796 --> 00:35:35,264
It wasn't that bad.
It was like a little loud.

543
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,833
That was my inner child being scared.

544
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:42,195
I'm fine, thanks. All right?

545
00:35:46,243 --> 00:35:48,234
EVP Experiment Number One.

546
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,705
Is there anyone here?

547
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,774
Where did you come from?

548
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:01,057
You have something to say?
In English, this time?

549
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:07,393
Would you be happier
talking with the Ouija board?

550
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:15,202
What is your quest?
What is your favorite color?

551
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,607
<i>Where did you come from?</i>

552
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,507
<i>You have something to say?</i>
<i>In English, this time?</i>

553
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:29,685
It's got nothing to say, huh?

554
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,618
<i>Would you be happier</i>
<i>talking with the Ouija board?</i>

555
00:36:33,223 --> 00:36:35,817
Whoa, what the hell.

556
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,852
Is that you grunting?

557
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:46,498
Was it like one for "Yes", two for "No"?

558
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,473
Yeah? Nice.

559
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,607
Yeah. Let's watch a movie.
I don't want to go to sleep yet.

560
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:59,477
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'm scared.

561
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:03,713
- Yeah.
- Come on, put the camera off.

562
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:52,788
Katie.

563
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,672
Katie!

564
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:08,176
You down here? Babe?

565
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:26,556
Fuck.

566
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,177
Katie?

567
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,353
Babe!

568
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:01,155
What are you doing out here?

569
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:05,594
- Hey. Hey.
- What?

570
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,432
It's freezing out here.
What are you doing with no clothes on?

571
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:12,008
- I'm fine.
- Come on.

572
00:40:12,142 --> 00:40:14,406
No. I don't want to go in.

573
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,240
Just leave me alone.

574
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,712
- Are you OK, baby?
- I'm fine.

575
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,950
- Come on.
- No.

576
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,714
You just want to sit out here
in the swing in the middle of the night,

577
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:32,454
- while it's freezing?
- Yes. Go away.

578
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:37,889
I'll stay out here with you.
I'm gonna get some blankets, OK?

579
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is going on?
Ridiculous.
Sitting out in the cold.

580
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,576
Fuck is that?

581
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,054
Hey! Who's there?

582
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,352
Katie, come inside!

583
00:41:13,303 --> 00:41:15,533
What the fuck is going on? Come out!

584
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,324
Fuck!

585
00:41:38,428 --> 00:41:40,259
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

586
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,763
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What do you mean?

587
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,996
I just heard noises up here
and I came in to get a blanket

588
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,935
- 'cause you're on the swing...
- What?

589
00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:52,837
...for some reason.
There's all this stomping up here...

590
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:55,638
- Come back to bed. You woke me up.
- And the TV is on.

591
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:00,373
Jesus. I don't know
what the fuck is going on anymore.

592
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:02,451
- I'm cold.
- Why are you crazy like this?

593
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,422
So you don't remember any of this?

594
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,293
No. I mean...

595
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,420
You don't remember getting out of bed?

596
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:17,533
You don't remember standing there
like a total weirdo?

597
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:18,760
Hey.

598
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:20,699
I'm saying, like...

599
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,399
- Oh, my goodness.
- And this? You don't...

600
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:25,872
Were you sleepwalking?

601
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:29,467
- What was going through your mind?
- I don't know! I wasn't... I...

602
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,274
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.

603
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,942
What do you remember from this?

604
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,247
- Were you dreaming?
- I don't remember anything.

605
00:42:38,388 --> 00:42:41,789
I remember standing in the doorway
and you pointing a camera at me.

606
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:45,656
And you were all freaked out.
I don't, I don't remember standing here.

607
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,627
You went downstairs, sat in the swing.

608
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:50,392
I went to get you a blanket
'cause you refused to come back.

609
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,468
Fast forward it
to where I go downstairs.

610
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,161
I'm freaking leaving the room. Where...

611
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,638
You went outside and sat on the swing.

612
00:42:59,776 --> 00:43:02,176
And I went inside to bring you a blanket

613
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:06,874
'cause you refused to leave in this
catatonic, weird state you were in.

614
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:09,383
- I don't know...
- Wait, wait. Did I talk to you?

615
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:11,214
I wouldn't call it talking.

616
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:16,019
But I come upstairs and there's
like footsteps, and the TV's on.

617
00:43:17,694 --> 00:43:18,991
So that's...

618
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:23,828
Well, maybe this kind of thing's
been happening for a long time

619
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:25,992
and you just never knew about it.

620
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:31,570
I don't remember anything. I know that
I had nightmares all night and that...

621
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:32,732
What?

622
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,608
I didn't want to talk about it.

623
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,942
They were gruesome.
Let's leave it at that.

624
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,676
It's trying to scare us.
It scared you and me...

625
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:44,582
- It's working! I'm scared!
- Just got to stay strong.

626
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,717
And not let it get to you,
not let it get to us.

627
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:55,389
Look, bringing in somebody else,
some exorcist or whatever,

628
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:58,626
lot of times it just gets worse.
You don't want it to get worse.

629
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:03,832
- No, I don't.
- No. Me neither.

630
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,382
Yeah, all right,
you little fucker.

631
00:44:12,382 --> 00:44:13,007
Yeah, all right,
you little fucker.

632
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,642
Got something to say?
Now's your chance.

633
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:20,690
Katie! Where are you?

634
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,291
I'll be down.
Hang on a second.

635
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:33,798
I can't wait to
get out of this house,

636
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:36,838
go out and hang out
with my boyfriend.

637
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,366
All right, we got,
like, ten minutes.

638
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,008
What in the hell
are you doing, Micah?

639
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:45,410
- Come on, help me.
- What are you doing?

640
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:47,210
- I'm gonna talk to it.
- Look at me!

641
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:48,339
I told you I was...

642
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,385
You promised me
you weren't gonna...

643
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,886
Don't you look at me like that.
You promised me

644
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,456
you weren't gonna mess
with that.

645
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,286
No! I promised you

646
00:44:56,426 --> 00:44:58,189
I wasn't gonna buy
a Ouija board.

647
00:44:58,328 --> 00:44:59,317
I didn't buy
a Ouija board.

648
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,260
You knew exactly
what I meant!

649
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:02,524
I borrowed
a Ouija board.

650
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,896
How dare you? You knew
exactly what I meant!

651
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,900
I said don't mess with that
because it scared me,

652
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,561
and what do you do?
You go out and get

653
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,366
the best looking fucking
Ouija board I've ever seen,

654
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,168
and you put it in the middle
of our living room?

655
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,436
- Explain that to me!
- I borrowed it.

656
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:16,136
You know, I don't care
what you did.

657
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:18,406
You're gonna throw it away.
We're gonna leave.

658
00:45:18,548 --> 00:45:19,776
- Katie...
- There's no more camera,

659
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,816
there's no more nothing.
I don't want to hear it.

660
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,681
- I don't even want to hear it.
- Katie.

661
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,344
No, don't "Katie" me.
I'm leaving

662
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,923
and you're either coming
with me or you're not.

663
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,384
- Chill it, babe!
- I don't want to hear it.

664
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,869
Take your shoes off
and go to bed...

665
00:46:47,003 --> 00:46:48,834
What?

666
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,667
What'd you do?
What'd you do, Micah?

667
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,604
Look at me!
What'd you do?

668
00:46:52,742 --> 00:46:54,937
I didn't do shit, babe.
Look...

669
00:46:58,014 --> 00:47:00,039
I cannot fucking
believe you, Micah.

670
00:47:03,386 --> 00:47:05,820
I am finished. No more
fucking camera, nothing.

671
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:06,945
I'll take care of this.

672
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,024
If you're not gonna do it,
then I will.

673
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:17,199
Looks like someone drew something on it.

674
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:22,569
I don't know. Hey, Katie?

675
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:24,105
What?

676
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:27,705
Can you come down here
and help me figure this out, please?

677
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,471
Sorry?

678
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,447
I think this thing left a message.
On the Ouija board.

679
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:41,148
I don't give a fuck what that thing
says on the Ouija board!

680
00:47:42,592 --> 00:47:43,957
Babe...

681
00:47:45,962 --> 00:47:47,987
Katie! Look...

682
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:54,294
- Kate. Hello. Hey.
- Micah, get the fuck out!

683
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,304
- I don't want to look at that!
- Chill!

684
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:02,900
- Look, this is not the time for this.
- Get out!

685
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,078
Get out!

686
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,251
I think she's pissed. That's not good.

687
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:21,089
Hey, Katie? Katie? Hello?

688
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,860
- Look, I know you're pissed, but...
- Do we have any lemon?

689
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:32,400
What do I have to do?
Just tell me what I have to do.

690
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,772
You have to turn off the fucking camera.

691
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,038
The camera's... Fuck.
Forget the camera, OK?

692
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:49,051
I swear to abide
by Katie's

693
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:53,253
rules and regulations
of camera use...

694
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:57,498
...and other things.
Whatever.

695
00:48:57,634 --> 00:48:58,828
Is that good enough
for you?

696
00:48:58,968 --> 00:49:01,300
I think it needs to be
a little more sincere.

697
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,132
I...

698
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:09,134
I swear to abide
by Katie's

699
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,476
rules and regulations
of camera use

700
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:15,914
and to not
offend this entity,

701
00:49:16,052 --> 00:49:18,043
or whatever it is,
in any way,

702
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,588
shape, or form,
so help me God.

703
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:24,125
And I promise not to
betray Katie's trust.

704
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,820
And I promise not to
betray Katie's trust.

705
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,931
- Is there anything else?
- That'll be it.

706
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:32,500
Good.

707
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,396
Fuck.

708
00:49:35,638 --> 00:49:39,074
Can I at least get
a kiss for that? Please?

709
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:43,607
Goodnight.

710
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,627
Katie.
Do you want to know

711
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,532
what happened to
the Ouija board?

712
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:11,333
I saw the tape,
you know.

713
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,477
I just want to
forget about it, OK?

714
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:27,920
Let's go to sleep.

715
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,135
I think I found something pretty cool,

716
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:44,763
and I'd like you to help me
figure it out.

717
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:49,504
So, sit down. No? Or stand up.

718
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:52,581
I caught on camera everything
that happened after we left.

719
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:56,344
- When the cursor was moving by itself.
- OK.

720
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,716
I'm trying to figure out what it said.

721
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,550
I couldn't figure out
exactly what it said,

722
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,684
but there's a lot of possibilities.

723
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,926
Do you know anyone
named Edina or Diane?

724
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:14,093
Could be Nadine, without two N's... No.

725
00:51:15,738 --> 00:51:19,003
- No.
- All right. Well, I'll work on it.

726
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,640
You know, it may...

727
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:24,110
It could be this thing's fucking
with us and it doesn't mean anything.

728
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,683
Or it could be... so many possibilities,
I mean, I could be wrong.

729
00:51:27,817 --> 00:51:28,977
I don't know.

730
00:51:29,118 --> 00:51:31,712
I don't really...
I don't really care what it means.

731
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,483
You're done playing with it.
I want it out of the house.

732
00:51:36,025 --> 00:51:38,550
We haven't gone a week
without something happening.

733
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,686
- That's crazy.
- I can't...

734
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,924
- What're you guys talking about?
- I'm at my... Just everything.

735
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,929
- Come stay with me.
- You remember, it's not the house.

736
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:50,130
It's me. You know,
wherever I go, it goes.

737
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,037
What am I gonna do, go to your house,
mess things up for you?

738
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:56,612
- I got a plan. Don't worry about it.
- Micah, what's your plan?

739
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:59,806
- I got a plan.
- What? What're you gonna do?

740
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:02,213
- You know what...
- Don't worry about it, OK?

741
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:06,780
- All right? So.
- OK, here's the compromise...

742
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:07,912
What?

743
00:52:08,057 --> 00:52:11,026
You can have your powder,
you can do your little experiment.

744
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,458
If it doesn't work,
if it doesn't help us,

745
00:52:13,596 --> 00:52:16,827
I'm calling the demonologist
and we're getting this taken care of.

746
00:52:16,966 --> 00:52:20,060
- Yeah. Deal.
- Can you look at me and not the camera?

747
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:22,797
No. Deal. All right, so.

748
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,998
- Happy, yeah?
- Yeah.

749
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,268
- Deal.
- All right.

750
00:52:28,511 --> 00:52:29,500
Is that thing on?

751
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:33,844
Yes. And exactly
what is this gonna prove?

752
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:37,475
Well, if anything walks through here,

753
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,349
it's gonna leave
a pretty good footprint.

754
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,856
OK. I think we've pretty much
established something's happening.

755
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:45,552
All right. So tomorrow,
I'm making the call.

756
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,459
You can have your powder.
You can clean it up tomorrow.

757
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:52,159
Take a deep breath,
pop a pill, it's fine.

758
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,600
- Excuse me?
- Figure out what we're dealing with.

759
00:52:54,737 --> 00:52:56,068
- Micah!
- OK?

760
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:59,766
- Then we can go crazy.
- Pop a pill, my ass.

761
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,237
Does that look good to you?

762
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:04,005
It looks like our floor
is covered with powder, yes.

763
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,342
- I'll clean it up.
- All right.

764
00:53:06,482 --> 00:53:08,109
That's a thing of beauty.

765
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:10,515
- Hey.
- Yeah.

766
00:53:10,653 --> 00:53:13,918
I've been doing my research.
I'm taking care of this.

767
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:18,255
Nobody comes in my house,
fucks with my girlfriend,

768
00:53:18,394 --> 00:53:20,385
gets away with it. Here.

769
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,554
What do you want
to do about it?

770
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,824
Want to call in
the demon guy?

771
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:24,558
- Yes! Exactly!
- Call an exorcist?

772
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,690
I want to
take care of this!

773
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:27,234
Get a quack to tell us
what to do?

774
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,395
This is my house,
you're my girlfriend.

775
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,769
I'm gonna fucking
solve the problem.

776
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:34,706
- OK?
- OK.

777
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:38,780
Babe. Just have
a little faith, huh?

778
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,347
This is it.

779
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:45,445
What's it?

780
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:50,688
The powder is the last.
The last thing.

781
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:53,022
Tomorrow I'm gonna
make the call.

782
00:53:53,162 --> 00:53:54,686
Too cute to be talking.

783
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,348
Did you hear that?

784
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:50,584
Oh, shit!

785
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,884
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

786
00:55:03,232 --> 00:55:04,392
You know what?

787
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:10,699
There's footsteps in,
but there's no footsteps out.

788
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,102
Oh, God!

789
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:17,445
- Don't leave me in here.
- Turn on the light, baby.

790
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,350
Let's just get out and go downstairs.

791
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:25,010
It's still here. Let's go!

792
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:31,119
It finally can't run. Where is it?

793
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,284
What?

794
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,723
The prints stop over here.

795
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:40,131
Micah, this could be a trap.
Please, let's go!

796
00:55:44,707 --> 00:55:45,969
Oh, my God!

797
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:48,503
Did you do that?

798
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,620
You didn't... You didn't, did you?
Tell me you opened that.

799
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:02,156
Of course not.
What the hell is that?

800
00:56:06,295 --> 00:56:08,661
You're not going up...
You're not going up there.

801
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:10,629
Oh, you're not going up there.

802
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:15,170
I'm not going in there. Just gonna...

803
00:56:15,304 --> 00:56:17,431
- Just gonna look.
- No, you're not!

804
00:56:18,674 --> 00:56:21,199
I gotta go check it out.
I'm getting the ladder.

805
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,040
OK. It's all set up.

806
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:28,947
Micah, I really don't want you
to go up there. Please.

807
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:32,384
I'm not going in there.
I'm just gonna look.

808
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,286
You have no idea what's up there.
You've no idea!

809
00:56:35,424 --> 00:56:36,789
I know.

810
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:44,163
Oh, Micah.

811
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,894
Give me the camera. Yeah.

812
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:51,632
- Be careful.
- All right, if something goes wrong,

813
00:56:51,774 --> 00:56:54,072
I'm gonna throw you the camera
and jump out, OK?

814
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:58,478
Do you see anything?

815
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:09,350
Micah, I don't want to
be down here by myself.

816
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:10,686
I'll be right back.

817
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,456
What the fuck is that?

818
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:21,367
There's something over there
stuck in the stuff.

819
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,529
Oh, my God, Micah,
come back down! Come on.

820
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,568
Micah, please, come on.

821
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,044
Now this...

822
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:32,713
Hold on. Here.

823
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,874
- What?
- Just take the camera.

824
00:57:35,017 --> 00:57:36,348
OK. Come on.

825
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:42,888
- I'll hold the ladder. Come down.
- Something up there, I got to look.

826
00:57:43,025 --> 00:57:45,152
Micah! Oh, God.

827
00:57:48,397 --> 00:57:49,796
Micah, please be careful.

828
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:53,191
Are you OK?

829
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:58,536
Micah, answer me! Micah. Micah!

830
00:57:58,674 --> 00:58:01,404
- I'm fine.
- I'm com... Ah, thank God.

831
00:58:03,512 --> 00:58:04,501
Fuck.

832
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:08,516
I found this up there.

833
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:14,285
No. No, no, no, no.
Let me see that.

834
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,295
- What're you talking about?
- This is our old house.

835
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:24,024
What in the hell is this
doing in the attic?

836
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:26,600
I thought all that stuff burned down.

837
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:30,467
There's no way. There is no way
you found that in our attic!

838
00:58:30,606 --> 00:58:32,665
There is no way that that even exists!

839
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:35,901
I haven't seen that picture
in 15 years.

840
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:41,383
That makes no sense.
That makes no sense at all.

841
00:58:51,627 --> 00:58:52,753
You OK, babe?

842
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,661
Would you turn the light off, please.

843
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,726
Sorry.

844
00:59:02,738 --> 00:59:04,729
Where was it when you found it?

845
00:59:06,909 --> 00:59:08,501
It was over our bed.

846
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:19,248
- I'm gonna go clean up that stuff.
- OK.

847
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,450
I don't have any idea
if I'm gonna get to class today.

848
00:59:29,865 --> 00:59:31,765
Oh, God, I'm so tired.

849
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,267
Why are you filming me?
I'm just making coffee.

850
00:59:36,405 --> 00:59:38,270
I'm actually sick of this.

851
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:43,837
I think we could both use
a little more sleep.

852
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:48,542
I think I could use a new life.
I'm so tired of this.

853
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,520
- Take a look at this.
- Take a look at what?

854
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:58,218
I lightened up the footage
from last night.

855
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,158
You can see the footsteps.

856
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,592
Oh, my God.

857
01:00:09,071 --> 01:00:11,539
- So?
- What?

858
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:12,971
What are you gonna do?

859
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,445
I don't know yet.

860
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:21,914
Well, I do. We're calling Dr. Averies.

861
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:24,918
You've had your camera work,
your powder on the floor,

862
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,885
and it's just gotten worse, OK?

863
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:32,086
We should've done this two weeks ago.
We're calling him. Today.

864
01:00:33,295 --> 01:00:36,560
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Let's talk about this first.

865
01:00:37,566 --> 01:00:40,262
Now, I'm in control,
think I'm making progress.

866
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:43,634
No, you haven't been having
progress and you're not in control!

867
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,934
It is in control.
If you think you're in control,

868
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,770
- you're an idiot!
- Hey! Stay cool.

869
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,343
Not a single thing
you've done has helped.

870
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:51,742
And I'm sorry, I don't mean
to burst your bubble,

871
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:54,543
but the camera hasn't helped,
the footprints haven't helped.

872
01:00:54,683 --> 01:00:57,550
Think that thing would've left
footprints if it didn't want to?

873
01:00:57,686 --> 01:01:00,587
No! It did it because it wanted to.
It wanted you to find my photo.

874
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:03,089
It can be anywhere.
It hears what we're saying now.

875
01:01:03,225 --> 01:01:06,786
- Hey! How the fuck do you know?
- You are absolutely powerless!

876
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,159
That's not true at all and you know it.

877
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:10,765
Well, get over it!

878
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:19,470
Well, I called Dr. Averies
and he's gone.

879
01:01:19,608 --> 01:01:22,042
Didn't know what else to do,
so I called Dr. Fredrichs.

880
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,941
I know you don't love him, but I did.

881
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:28,073
And he's coming back tomorrow.
That was as soon as he could get here.

882
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:30,879
So maybe if we make it till then,
we could hold off...

883
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,454
- We'll make it till then!
- I'm just saying that we could just...

884
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:37,355
- "Make it till then." God!
- We could hold out, we'll be OK,

885
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:43,363
- and maybe tomorrow he'll help us.
- Fucking people! Ridiculous.

886
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

887
01:02:21,737 --> 01:02:23,295
Fuck!

888
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:24,428
What happened?

889
01:02:24,573 --> 01:02:26,666
What're you doing? Micah.

890
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:28,800
What're you doing? What'd you hear?

891
01:02:28,944 --> 01:02:30,673
Something out there.

892
01:02:31,747 --> 01:02:34,215
- Fuck!
- Oh, God.

893
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,476
Goddamn it!

894
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:38,348
Baby, come here. Please don't go...

895
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:43,015
Please, just stay, please. Don't go.

896
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:46,160
I'm going out there and see...

897
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:49,822
Wait, Micah, don't go. Don't, please.

898
01:02:49,965 --> 01:02:53,025
Please. Please don't open it.

899
01:02:55,437 --> 01:02:57,962
Micah, come on. Come on.

900
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,167
Right now. Come on. Micah.

901
01:03:07,249 --> 01:03:08,580
Who's there?

902
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:14,186
- Baby, come on!
- You gonna fuck with us?

903
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:22,820
Micah, don't. Come on. Let's go.

904
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,455
Show yourself!

905
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come on, Micah. Let's go.
We've got to get out.
- Got a problem?
- Stop!

906
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:34,270
All right, hon, I'm sorry.

907
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:41,706
Micah...

908
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,856
Please let go of it.

909
01:03:55,297 --> 01:03:56,958
Oh, it's scaring us.

910
01:03:57,833 --> 01:03:59,391
Hey.

911
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:04,367
- Not gonna make a difference.
- I'm not going in that bedroom.

912
01:04:04,506 --> 01:04:06,337
- Look...
- I'm not going in that bedroom.

913
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:08,841
- Oh, please, please...
- Baby, look, if it comes back...

914
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,105
No, downstairs. Let's just... Please.

915
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:15,806
Babe. It's not gonna make a difference.

916
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:17,612
- I can't...
- Come on.

917
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:20,187
I don't wanna be in here.
I don't wanna be even downstairs.

918
01:04:20,322 --> 01:04:22,882
Please, please...
Please, please. Please.

919
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:25,050
All right.

920
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,091
What the hell is in here now?

921
01:04:35,804 --> 01:04:38,500
I don't know if down here
is gonna be much better.

922
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:47,144
Micah. I don't want to be here.

923
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:03,395
I think we should go upstairs.
Again. Come here.

924
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:23,780
Katie?

925
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:28,688
Babe?

926
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:41,130
You know, gotta get some sleep
once in a while.

927
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:44,263
I'm just scared.

928
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:48,976
I couldn't be in that room anymore.

929
01:05:53,615 --> 01:05:55,242
I understand.

930
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,676
I can't even be in this house, Micah.

931
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:03,018
We can't even be in our house.

932
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

933
01:06:22,978 --> 01:06:24,843
What the fuck is that?

934
01:06:33,355 --> 01:06:34,686
I'll check the mirrors.

935
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,222
Our picture!

936
01:06:46,835 --> 01:06:48,769
- What picture?
- That one, look!

937
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:55,733
Fuck! What the hell?

938
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:58,369
How come my face is scratched
and yours isn't?

939
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,505
Something's here.

940
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:04,745
- This is bullshit.
- It's here.

941
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:09,586
What's here? What?
What're you talking about?

942
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:14,662
I don't know. I feel it.
I feel it breathing on me.

943
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:20,596
Micah, come on! Come on! Please!

944
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,496
Fuckin'-A, man.

945
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:30,609
Fuckin'-A.

946
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:38,183
- Babe. Come downstairs.
- Jesus Christ.

947
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,651
Come on.

948
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:49,329
Has this shit happened
in the daytime before?

949
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:54,359
It's getting worse.

950
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:57,369
Fuck.

951
01:08:00,075 --> 01:08:03,135
- Hey, baby, stop pacing, please.
- I'm sorry.

952
01:08:03,278 --> 01:08:05,769
- It's making me nervous.
- Well, I'm nervous.

953
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:11,041
Katie, hi.

954
01:08:11,186 --> 01:08:13,950
Hi, come in, please.
Thank you so much for coming back.

955
01:08:14,089 --> 01:08:15,954
Oh, we've gotta follow up.
Micah, hi.

956
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:18,184
Yeah. We called Dr. Averies,
but he's gone.

957
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:21,160
Yes, he's out of the country.
He'll be back. He'll be... Wow.

958
01:08:21,296 --> 01:08:23,355
- We need your help.
- This is overpowering.

959
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:25,797
- It's worse.
- Yes. It doesn't like that I'm here.

960
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:27,265
- I cannot help you.
- What?

961
01:08:27,402 --> 01:08:30,064
I've got to get out of here. This thing
is aggravated by the fact that I'm here.

962
01:08:30,205 --> 01:08:31,570
You can't leave us alone here.

963
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:33,572
Everybody calm down.
We need your help.

964
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:37,008
Well, I've got to tell you, I am not the
person to help you in this situation.

965
01:08:37,145 --> 01:08:39,113
This is not my area of expertise.

966
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:42,115
Now, I think I'm doing more harm
being here than any good.

967
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:43,775
- What?
- Yes, I have got to leave.

968
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:45,682
Dr. Averies will be back in a few days.

969
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:48,051
When he gets here
he'll take care of your problems.

970
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,317
What should we do?
Should we leave?

971
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:51,790
Leaving won't help at all.

972
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:54,225
Let me see what I can do.
But I've got to leave this room now.

973
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:56,831
- This is no joke.
- I will help you.

974
01:08:56,965 --> 01:08:58,899
- But I can't do this now.
- No, no, no, no!

975
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:00,695
You serious?

976
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,133
We'll take care of this ourselves, OK?

977
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:08,937
Katie?

978
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:13,242
Fuck.

979
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,025
I'm so fucking tired of this.

980
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,731
I know you are.

981
01:09:38,373 --> 01:09:40,398
I don't want it to be like this.

982
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:11,364
- Micah! Micah, wake up.
- What's the matter?

983
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,367
I just...
I just felt him breathing.

984
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:18,270
Right there.
He was right there,

985
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:19,635
I felt him breathing.

986
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:26,481
What are you doing?

987
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,481
Where're you going?
Micah, come back!

988
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:34,611
I'm not going anywhere.

989
01:11:34,756 --> 01:11:37,725
Chill. There's
nothing happening.

990
01:11:37,859 --> 01:11:40,760
I know, I'm telling you.
I'm telling you.

991
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:41,885
I... Please.

992
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:45,591
OK, OK.
I won't leave you.

993
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:48,032
Don't you feel it?

994
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:52,135
I feel it, he's still here.

995
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:53,969
Something,
something's wrong.

996
01:11:55,877 --> 01:11:57,469
Take a deep breath,
OK?

997
01:12:12,694 --> 01:12:14,685
I can feel it watching me.

998
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:18,665
Right now.

999
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,802
Fuck. You're freaking me out, babe.

1000
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:24,132
- We have to do something.
- What?

1001
01:12:24,272 --> 01:12:27,036
I don't know.
We've got to figure something out.

1002
01:12:27,175 --> 01:12:30,611
- We have to...
- OK. OK, OK.

1003
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:31,735
I'll figure something out.

1004
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,815
I'll do some research.
There's gotta be some other options.

1005
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:38,551
OK.

1006
01:12:43,658 --> 01:12:45,421
- Jesus.
- This is creepy.

1007
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,358
I knew something happened last night.

1008
01:12:51,366 --> 01:12:53,561
Ah, shit.

1009
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:58,495
We've got to do something.
I can feel something's wrong.

1010
01:13:05,313 --> 01:13:08,544
So I was doing some research,
just trying to figure out our options.

1011
01:13:08,683 --> 01:13:11,413
- Right.
- I found this website.

1012
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:14,989
This chick, Diane, one of
the possibilities from the board?

1013
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:17,814
Yeah.

1014
01:13:17,959 --> 01:13:21,395
All the same things happened to her
in the 60's that's happened to you.

1015
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,589
Wait. What do you mean
she has the same things?

1016
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:27,600
Like everything. You're eight years old
and like you had a house burning down,

1017
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:33,697
seeing shadows and whatever.
God knows. And she called an exorcist.

1018
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:36,376
Is that her?

1019
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,911
You're telling me there's
some girl from the 60's

1020
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:42,039
who had the exact same things
happen to her.

1021
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:47,349
Yeah. Down to a T. You say...
Maybe this thing is the same thing.

1022
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:51,391
It just jumped to you instead.
And that's just its m.o., or whatever.

1023
01:13:51,526 --> 01:13:53,153
And he's trying to warn us,

1024
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:57,561
with this Ouija board, trying to tell us
to find this woman so we know...

1025
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:00,167
Wait. So what happened to her?
Is she OK?

1026
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:05,640
They tried to get rid of it,
sometimes that just pisses it off more.

1027
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:10,566
Before the exorcist got there,
she wasn't like this.

1028
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:14,045
She was just hearing voices
and having bad dreams.

1029
01:14:14,749 --> 01:14:16,808
I'm trying to find some kind of reason

1030
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:20,217
this thing would pick you
after haunting her.

1031
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:22,152
I can't find anything.

1032
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:24,918
From what I've been reading,
these things are totally random.

1033
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,620
- There's just no reason. Like...
- How did she die?

1034
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:32,226
She's pretty.

1035
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:35,495
Now she is. I think this
thing's trying to warn us

1036
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:39,403
not to fuck with it.
I don't want to take a chance.

1037
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,705
Oh, God!

1038
01:14:44,846 --> 01:14:46,711
There's no way that we're doing this.

1039
01:14:46,848 --> 01:14:49,476
It's gone away on its own before.

1040
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,677
This is not worth the risk.

1041
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:54,883
I'm gonna go lie down.

1042
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:04,424
Hey, Katie, I got a idea
about what we can do.

1043
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:06,363
Some more stuff. In fact...

1044
01:15:06,501 --> 01:15:09,959
Would you please get away from me
with that camera? I'm trying to study.

1045
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:14,165
All right. I kinda want to talk
to you about this thing.

1046
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:17,506
Micah, please.
Will you give me five minutes?

1047
01:15:18,813 --> 01:15:20,041
Go! Please!

1048
01:15:20,181 --> 01:15:23,673
Hey, chill out! All right?
I'm trying to help this situation here.

1049
01:15:23,818 --> 01:15:25,547
I have ideas I want to
talk to you about.

1050
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,121
OK, you and your
stupid camera are the problem.

1051
01:15:29,257 --> 01:15:31,657
- What the fuck?!
- Just leave me alone.

1052
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:34,557
Will you stop
following me with the camera!

1053
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:38,325
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I didn't bring that thing to the house.

1054
01:15:38,466 --> 01:15:40,593
- Well, don't do me any favors.
- You did!

1055
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:45,163
Thank you, Micah.
Thank you so much.

1056
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:48,470
Well, hang out with your
friend upstairs. I'll be down here.

1057
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,306
- Shut up!
- Whatever.

1058
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:01,611
Hey.

1059
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:08,888
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

1060
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:11,723
You didn't do anything wrong.

1061
01:16:11,866 --> 01:16:14,835
It's not your fault.
Now listen to me, it's not your fault.

1062
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,165
You haven't done anything wrong.

1063
01:16:17,305 --> 01:16:19,136
OK?

1064
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,929
Micah. Micah! Micah!

1065
01:16:51,072 --> 01:16:53,302
Micah! Micah!

1066
01:16:53,441 --> 01:16:55,204
- Katie!
- Micah!

1067
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:03,010
Let her go!

1068
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,657
Micah! Micah!

1069
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,689
Micah, make it stop!

1070
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:43,948
I don't care, I just want to go.
I just want to go.

1071
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:46,890
I can't... I can't,
I can't be here. I can't.

1072
01:17:47,028 --> 01:17:49,121
Just, let's go. Please, let's go.

1073
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,994
Let's just go right now.
Let's get in the car and let's go.

1074
01:17:53,134 --> 01:17:57,594
Yeah. All right, we're leaving.
I'll get us a hotel.

1075
01:17:57,739 --> 01:18:00,867
We'll stay there tonight,
until we figure out what we're doing.

1076
01:18:01,676 --> 01:18:03,610
We're not staying here another night.

1077
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:07,404
Here, let me get a shot of that thing
it made on your back.

1078
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:09,847
OK? Is that OK?

1079
01:18:17,992 --> 01:18:20,324
Oh, Jesus!

1080
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:27,030
- Sorry. Looks like something bit you!
- I know.

1081
01:18:30,438 --> 01:18:31,962
Let's go.

1082
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:34,965
Hey! Baby, you ready to go?

1083
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:39,074
Car's packed. Let's go. Hey, babe?

1084
01:18:41,816 --> 01:18:43,750
Babe, hey!

1085
01:18:48,389 --> 01:18:51,586
Babe. Let go of this thing.
Hey! Let go.

1086
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:55,352
Jesus Christ.

1087
01:18:59,767 --> 01:19:02,395
Babe? Oh my God!

1088
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:07,031
Hey. Katie! Katie! Wake up.

1089
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:11,839
Jesus. I've had it with this shit!

1090
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:18,947
Babe! Come on, let's go.

1091
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:24,283
Let's get you up. Come on.
Hey. Come on. Come on.

1092
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:26,085
Let's get to the couch.

1093
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:30,955
Come on. I've had it with this shit.

1094
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,624
I'm taking care of this right now!

1095
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:52,653
Fuck this shit, I'm done!

1096
01:19:58,993 --> 01:20:03,225
Katie. Ready to go?
Let's get out of here.

1097
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:05,688
Babe?

1098
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:07,357
I packed the car. Let's go.

1099
01:20:08,269 --> 01:20:09,702
I don't want to go.

1100
01:20:09,837 --> 01:20:12,271
What're you talking about,
you don't want to go?

1101
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:14,204
Let's get the fuck
outta this house, now!

1102
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:18,005
I don't want to leave.
Will you stay with me?

1103
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:23,675
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I think it'd be better if we stay.

1104
01:20:23,818 --> 01:20:26,582
Please. Just...

1105
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:30,350
I don't want to go.
I don't want to leave. Just trust me.

1106
01:20:30,491 --> 01:20:32,652
You wanna stay here
and sleep in this fucking bed

1107
01:20:32,794 --> 01:20:34,955
and be dragged down the hall?
I don't think so.

1108
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:37,496
We'll be OK. We'll be OK.
It's better if we stay.

1109
01:20:38,566 --> 01:20:39,965
You fucking...

1110
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:46,637
I don't know what the hell's going on,
but this is insane. Fuck!

1111
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,407
I think we'll be OK now.

1112
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1113
01:23:02,845 --> 01:23:06,747
- Micah!
- Katie!

1114
01:23:09,852 --> 01:23:11,786
What's the matter,
honey?

1115
01:23:14,057 --> 01:23:15,217
Oh, my God!

1116
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

1117
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
