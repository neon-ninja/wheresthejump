Where's he...

348
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,833
No, no. I mean,
they saw us.

349
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,936
So, I mean, they're gonna
be coming back, baby.
Don't worry.

350
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:54,872
I mean, they're gonna
send somebody or something.

351

ANA: It's safe here.
We'll just wait for them
to come back.

352
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:20,655
I don't want anybody
sneaking around
and stealing shit.

353
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,567
Comprende?

354
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,374
Sweet dreams.

355

Those assholes
are gonna get us killed.

356

to create problems
for Luda and me.

coming back soon.

359
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,357
I hope so.

360
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,363
And what's that
supposed to mean?

361
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:55,533
It means it might come
and it might not.
We don't know.

362
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,501
What do you mean
it not come back?

363

You said it was
coming back!

364

Hey, baby, listen, listen.

he doesn't know shit.

I hear you talking a lot.

saying something.

Hey, Officer,
how you like following
a guy that sells TVs?

375
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:43,504
About as much
as I like following a guy
who steals them.

376
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,518
I'm not following anyone.

377
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,420

to get my brother.

378

to feed on warm flesh.

if any, reasoning power.

are so full of shit.

the same damn thing
all day.

they kill gets up.

something that sucks?

at Dairy Queen?

I don't know when
we'll be back on the air.

Yeah.

391
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,729
She was coming
over tonight.

392
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,028
I would have tapped
that shit for sure.

393

everybody's dead, okay?

to report the news to you
in these past 26 years.

Hell is overflowing.

401
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:59,714
And Satan is sending
his dead to us.

402
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,791
Why? Because

403
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,559
you have sex out of wedlock.

404
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:13,601

your god will judge you?

408
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,677
Well, friends,

409
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:32,622
now we know.

410
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:40,096
When there is
no more room in hell,

411
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,436
the dead will walk the earth

412
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,730

I wish somebody was working
at Hallowed Grounds.

How hard is it
to make a cup of coffee?

421

mocha latte with foam.

00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,819
What's the news?

425
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:13,924

I'm telling you.

of shit, right?

Yeah, I do all that
kind of shit.

Is this the end of times?

I'm telling you,
I'm fucked.

bad things in my life, man.

of going to hell

you've done.

to St. Verbena?

Yeah.

said it was safe there.

are in the chapel.

No, he plays the organ.
