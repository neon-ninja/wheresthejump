1
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,250
<i>We're all around you.</i>

2
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,583
<i>Living right under your noses…</i>

3
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,083
<i>And you have no idea.</i>

4
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,625
<i>Things were a lot simpler in the old days.</i>

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,208
<i>We hunted you,</i>

6
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,750
<i>and you hunted us.</i>

7
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,625
<i>In Los Angeles,</i>

8
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:39,250
<i>no one fought harder
than a place called Boyle Heights.</i>

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,791
<i>So, we struck up a truce</i>

10
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:47,041
<i>to maintain the peace
between our kind and yours.</i>

11
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,916
<i>We lived in secret,</i>

12
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,625
<i>and you convinced yourselves
you had never really believed.</i>

13
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,208
<i>You forgot to be afraid.</i>

14
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:58,958
<i>You made books and movies about us
and got most of the details wrong,</i>

15
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,125
<i>while we became richer</i>

16
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,958
<i>and more powerful
than you could ever imagine.</i>

17
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:08,125
<i>To this day, there are some
who still uphold the truce,</i>

18
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,333
<i>who keep our secret.</i>

19
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,958
<i>As long as we stick to the three rules.</i>

20
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,041
<i>Don't let humans know we exist,</i>

21
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,291
<i>don't feed on the unwilling,</i>

22
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:22,708
<i>and never ever enter Boyle Heights
without permission.</i>

23
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,583
- Jay!
- Sorry.

24
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,708
- You scared me.
- I got distracted.

25
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,625
How sorry?

26
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,291
I'll-make-it-up-to-you sorry.

27
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,541
Oh, you'll-make-it-up-to-me kind of sorry.

28
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,958
How are you gonna do that?

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,250
What?

30
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,416
Nah, you look nice.

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,958
I look nice?

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,416
You're so stupid.

33
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,083
What the...

34
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,916
- What is it?
- They shouldn't be over here.

35
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,375
Oh my God. Jay, who is that?

36
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,750
A dead man.

37
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,833
Put the gun back.
We cannot do this.

38
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:01,875
Holy shit, please keep driving. Jay.
Jay, it's green, just go!

39
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,625
- Jay, what's going on?
- I gotta warn my guys.

40
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,416
I need you to take the car
and go to your brother's. Okay?

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

42
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,625
Maria!

43
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,041
Good morning, Mr. Perez.
What were you dreaming about?

44
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,416
Sorry. I…

45
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,208
Hey, uh, B-plus, 60 bucks.

46
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,875
Thank you, sir.
You're a lifesaver, you know that?

47
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,875
You're saving my ass with this paper, bro.

48
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,666
<i>We're gonna check out
this club downtown, Three Kings?</i>

49
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,583
<i>Table, bottle service.</i>

50
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,916
- Right.
- It's 300 a head. You wanna roll with?

51
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,208
Shit, 300 a head? Uh…

52
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,291
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,833
Nah, I already got some stuff
I gotta get into.

54
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,416
- I bet you do.
- Next time, my bad.

55
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,875
All right. Stay easy.

56
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,458
Yo!

57
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,916
Yo, what's good, Benny?

58
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,375
Hey, what's up, slick?
You got that kit for me?

59
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,083
Let's call it an even 40, bro.

60
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,625
40, like 40 bucks?

61
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,125
That's what I said.

62
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,958
I'mma put The Heights
on the map. I'm telling you, bro.

63
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,666
Step one, finish this track.
Two, set up the label.

64
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,500
Three, world domination. It's simple.

65
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,333
Building an empire,
but you can't even play me one track, bro?

66
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,583
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>When it's ready, it's ready, all right?</i>

67
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,000
Hello, Benny.

68
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,208
Hey, Grandma.

69
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,250
You came at a good time.

70
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,041
Yeah? Why's that?

71
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,500
I just took out
some flautitas and some empanadas.

72
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,833
Nice!

73
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,333
Are you hungry?

74
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,208
- You know it.
- But why do I bother shopping

75
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,250
if you're never
going to cook me a <i>sancoche?</i>

76
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,916
You know I don't cook that.

77
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,416
You know that one of these days
I'm going to buy you a house.

78
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,166
I don't need
my own home, my love.

79
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,291
What I do need is for you
to finish your studies

80
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,250
so you can take care of yourself.

81
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,833
Because someday
I'm gonna die, and so will you.

82
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,041
Ay, Ma, why you gotta talk like that?
So negative. I don't like it.

83
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,083
Well, that's life, son.

84
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,708
We all come tumbling down.

85
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,291
Bro, you told me
you could handle it.

86
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,750
No, I told you. This is...

87
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,666
Come on, Jessie,
you're really gonna do me like that?

88
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,875
I need someone to cover the car tonight.

89
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,708
It's about Maria.

90
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,791
Yeah, well, I thought I could rely on you!

91
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,291
Yeah, fine, whatever.

92
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,291
Why are you creeping?

93
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,291
If I'd know you was coming through,
I would've rolled out the red carpet.

94
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,833
I have to pick up some things,
check in on Grandma.

95
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,791
- Check in on your punk ass.
- Ha.

96
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:43,125
Oh, wait a minute. What's this?
Bro, that some gray hairs on your head?

97
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,208
Hey, I'm serious.
You're getting old, <i>papi.</i>

98
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,375
Just wait. It's gonna happen to you too.

99
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,125
I don't know if you're working tonight,
but maybe we could go to Mario's,

100
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,833
grab a pizza, watch the game.

101
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,333
I got something else tonight.

102
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,500
All right,
then who's covering the car, then?

103
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,750
I had to cancel.
Everyone's booked up.

104
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,166
All right, but you see,
I was thinking, like, what if,

105
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,291
you see, what if I take the car? Right?

106
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,083
- 'Cause I could use the money.
- No way.

107
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,125
- Why not?
- One, you're a bad driver.

108
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,333
Bad… That's bullshit.

109
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,166
When was the last time
you were west of K-Town?

110
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,791
Hey, Jay, my man, look,
I am way more responsible

111
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,000
than all them dudes
you got out there at the depot.

112
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,291
Yeah, except them dudes at the depot,
they got chauffeur's license,

113
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,041
they're insured by the company,
and they actually own a suit.

114
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:25,875
I… You see, the thing is, though,
Jay, I got a suit. I got a suit, Jay.

115
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,083
What, you and Maria been fighting?
That's what it is?

116
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,875
You having some relationship issues?

117
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,041
If you want to talk to me,
you can talk to me.

118
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,208
I give great advice.
That's what people be saying.

119
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,791
Yeah, right.

120
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,583
Man, whatever.

121
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,458
Where'd you get that?

122
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,041
Don't worry about it.

123
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,791
- What's this thing you gotta do tonight?
- I said don't worry about it.

124
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,875
- All right. Fine, man.
- I didn't even…

125
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,333
So secretive, man.

126
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,208
Hey, Benny.

127
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,791
Scratch it, I'll kill you.

128
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,083
Yo. You serious?

129
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,916
Man! I'm gonna need me one of these.

130
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,208
You can't afford it.

131
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,875
Well, I'mma flip my beats,
and I'mma get me a better one.

132
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,666
- What do you think about that?
- Listen to me.

133
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,166
Take them where they need to go,
come straight back.

134
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,375
- Understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

135
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,041
Check it out.

136
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,125
Oh shit.

137
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,375
That's pretty cool.

138
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,750
Insurance and registration
are in the glove compartment.

139
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,625
Chauffeur's license on the visor.

140
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,625
Everything's under my name,
so if anyone asks, you're me.

141
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,041
- I'm going to Beverly Hills?
- Hey, pay attention.

142
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,750
If anyone asks, you're me, got it?

143
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,083
- Yeah.
- Dispatch says it's an all-nighter.

144
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,083
Probably a twentysomething
director wannabe high out of his mind.

145
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,041
Act professional, and he'll give you
a fat tip at the end of the night.

146
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,666
Hey. Don't blow the sub, Dr. Dre.

147
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,000
Look, if the subs want to bark,
you gotta let 'em bark.

148
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:11,250
No, the subs don't wanna bark. Okay?
I'm serious. I'll yank you out of here.

149
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,500
- I'll take the no-show penalty.
- Okay. No barking, you got it.

150
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,875
Thanks for doing this.

151
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,458
Hey, just, um, be careful, all right?

152
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,500
I'm always careful.

153
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,583
I got… I got the car!

154
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,083
Huh? What?

155
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,625
Oh!

156
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,166
That was a cop. That was a cop.

157
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,291
What? I went in front of the guy!

158
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,375
Wow.

159
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,666
Wow, wow.

160
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,250
Okay.

161
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,000
Um, good… good evening, Miss Moreau.

162
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,083
You're the driver?

163
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,583
Uh, yeah. Yes. Yes, I am.

164
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:28,708
Miss Moreau is running a little bit late.
I'm her friend Blaire.

165
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,916
Okay, cool. I'm… I'm… I'm Jay.

166
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,708
Hi, Jay.

167
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,916
Something wrong?

168
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,666
No.

169
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,500
Mm-mm.

170
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,125
What?

171
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,250
Your zipper is down.

172
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,125
Oh shit.

173
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,750
Wow.

174
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,333
Sorry, I… I… I don't…
I don't mean to be unprofessional.

175
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,833
I just… I should…
I had no idea that it was down.

176
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,541
- Okay.
- Yeah.

177
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:06,041
I'm just gonna stop talking 'cause I feel
like I'm making it worse now.

178
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:10,833
Well, how about you open the door for me,
and then maybe we can call it even?

179
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:12,708
Thanks.

180
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,166
Thanks.

181
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,541
You know, if you need me
to adjust anything, like the…

182
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,916
- like the AC, I… I can do that.
- Hmm?

183
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,541
Or… or more warm, if you're like…
if it feels chilly for you 'cause I know...

184
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,833
- Okay.
- You know, women's bodies...

185
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,708
Women's bodies?

186
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,666
I'm good. Thank you.

187
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,458
Like, I know
people get cold, so whatever...

188
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,083
Yeah. Thank you.

189
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,833
Yeah. I got you.

190
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,875
She's gonna be pissed
if you don't open the door for her.

191
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,041
Oh.
You're right. My bad. Thanks.

192
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,291
Hello, Miss Moreau.
I… I'm Jay. I'll be your driver tonight.

193
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,416
You're adorable.

194
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,041
Do you need help with your bags?

195
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,375
You don't look like a driver.

196
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,666
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

197
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,125
Uh…

198
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,500
Are you sure you know
what you're doing there, Jay?

199
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,791
Um, no, I was just trying
to put the address in.

200
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,791
Except I haven't given you
the address yet, have I?

201
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,875
Right. Yeah. I know.

202
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,208
We're hitting every one
of these parties tonight,

203
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,750
and we need to get
to the last stop by morning.

204
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,583
That's nonnegotiable.

205
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,333
Are we clear?

206
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,416
Yeah.

207
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,208
Oh, and Jay, can you turn the air on?

208
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,916
Yeah. Make it icy.

209
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,208
Hey, driver. You wanna put on something
that doesn't suck?

210
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,541
Yes, ma'am.

211
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,416
Actually, Jay…

212
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,833
let's play a game.

213
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,625
What would you do if you knew
tonight was your last night on Earth?

214
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:50,625
Wow, uh… I never really thought
about it, to be honest.

215
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,125
Okay. Well, think about it.

216
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,708
I mean, you must have some fantasies.

217
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,375
I don't… I don't really like
to think that way, you know.

218
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,500
Like, to fantasize?

219
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,166
Yeah, you know, it's like,
I'm doing things today.

220
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,583
I'm building things for the future.
You know what I mean?

221
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,291
- I'm not sure you understand how to play.
- I do. What I'm trying to say is...

222
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,625
Last night on Earth, Jay.
Drugs, women, men,

223
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,208
old enemies you're just waiting to pop.

224
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,083
Nah, sorry,
I'm a pretty chill guy.

225
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,541
You know,
I go to school, live with my <i>abuela...</i>

226
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,458
You live with your <i>abuela?</i>

227
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,375
- Yeah.
- That's cute.

228
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:27,125
New game. Fuck, marry, kill.
Me, Blaire, your <i>abuela.</i>

229
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,375
S… sorry, what?

230
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:33,000
- I know you know this game.
- No, I do. I… I know this game.

231
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,666
It's just, you know,
I'm trying to be professional.

232
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,416
- Look, Blaire. Me, the Pope, the driver.
- You're not even trying.

233
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,291
- Personally, I would bang me.
- Fine. Okay, you could get it.

234
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:46,708
Kill the Pope, which I guess
puts me marrying Jay, the driver.

235
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,750
- He seems like husband material.
- You hear that, driver?

236
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,458
Come on, fess up.
Me, Blaire, your grandma.

237
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,208
I'd definitely kill you.

238
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,166
Finally, he bites back.

239
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,666
Maybe he's not a total dud.

240
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,500
I don't know. Maybe not.

241
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,083
Hey, driver. Keep your eyes on the road.

242
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:41,708
Thanks.

243
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,541
Some party.

244
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,791
You wouldn't know a party
if it fucked you in the face.

245
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,208
What's up, G?

246
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,500
What's the word?

247
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,375
Three generations deep,
and I'm the one to break the peace.

248
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,875
That's on him. Not us.

249
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:25,125
Victor knows we're off-limits.
He's starting a war with Boyle Heights.

250
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:28,458
He took Maria… to get to me.

251
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,208
There's no turning back.

252
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,958
We have until tomorrow morning.

253
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:35,791
After that,

254
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,500
either Victor's dead, or we are.

255
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,208
Let's go put this work in.

256
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,083
Back in the car, driver!

257
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,416
Yo, Jay.

258
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,875
You want some?

259
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,875
Uh, I… I can't really do that.

260
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,666
- Sorry.
- You can't?

261
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,083
- I can't.
- That's boring.

262
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:05,916
Zoé!

263
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,666
- That's gonna be a fine.
- Oh, there's a fine?

264
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,958
- Yeah.
- Don't worry, driver. We can afford it.

265
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,541
Stay.

266
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,625
See you soon.

267
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,000
<i>Hey, it's Jay.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

268
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,833
Yo, it's Benny. Um, look,
I don't know what you're up to,

269
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:05,166
but, um, I… I think there's
something… something weird going on,

270
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,500
and just whenever you get a chance,
just hit me back, aight?

271
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,375
Serious.

272
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:28,916
Whoa.

273
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,750
What the… Oh my…

274
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,791
Oh, no, no, no.

275
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,000
No, no, no.

276
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,458
Hey!

277
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
How may I help you, sir?

278
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,625
Hi. Uh…

279
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,000
- Sir, you are sweating.
- Oh.

280
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,666
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

281
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,541
- I, um… I was just…
- Mm-hmm.

282
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,666
- I… I was outside and...
- What's that on your shirt?

283
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,125
- Huh?
- Your shirt.

284
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,250
I…

285
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:53,833
I… I got, um…

286
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:57,125
This is a members-only establishment,
so perhaps I should call somebody.

287
00:25:57,208 --> 00:26:00,083
- No, no, no, I'm fine. It's just...
- It's okay. It'll just be one second.

288
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:03,083
No, no, no, no, hey, hey.
It's… it's okay. I just… I, um…

289
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:06,833
Please accept
my most sincere apology, sir.

290
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:11,458
May I?

291
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,041
Yeah.

292
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,083
Mmm. Will you be meeting anyone upstairs?

293
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,125
Mm-hmm, yeah. I, um…

294
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,750
I'm… I'm meeting the… the two girls,

295
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,958
uh, Blaire and… and… and… and Zoé.

296
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:31,041
Of course, sir.
They're with Daniel and Max as we speak.

297
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:34,708
The owners, sir.

298
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:36,083
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

299
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,250
- Yeah.
- Allow me to escort you to the elevator.

300
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:39,208
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

301
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:42,041
Please, I don't…
I don't… I don't have all day.

302
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,916
Should you need anything at all,

303
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,375
there's a phone located in your room
that links directly to my desk.

304
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:13,500
Myself or a member of my staff
will be happy to assist you.

305
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And, please, drink responsibly.

306
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:07,125
Hey.

307
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
H… hey.
- This isn't what it looks like.
- Okay. I'm just…

308
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:18,583
Oh my God.

309
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,291
He's shaking.

310
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,625
I love it when they shake.

311
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,333
It's so cute.

312
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:29,166
Max over there tasted like motor oil.

313
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,500
I bet Jay gives good blood.

314
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,833
Don't you, Jay?

315
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,833
I'm not Jay.

316
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:42,083
- What?
- I'm not Jay. My name's Benny.

317
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:45,875
- I'm just… I'm his brother.
- I'm just covering for him.

318
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:50,333
I knew it.

319
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:52,958
What did I tell you?

320
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,208
I knew this little shit
couldn't be Jay Perez.

321
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,500
All right.

322
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,250
Let's drink the driver.

323
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,166
What? No, no, no, no.

324
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,958
- I don't know. He could come in handy.
- Handy for what?

325
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,958
I don't need someone
to hold the door for me tonight.

326
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,000
- No.
- Wait, wait.

327
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,875
I bet he could take us to Jay.

328
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,000
Benny, do you think you could do that?

329
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,000
You think you could show us
where your brother is?

330
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:23,791
That was great.

331
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,000
Oh, is he okay?

332
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:32,666
Hey, Max, buddy!

333
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,791
- Did they go a little too hard on you?
- You had one thing to do.

334
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,166
- Just one.
- I know. I'm sorry.

335
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,250
I got a little distracted
because someone walked in on us.

336
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:42,541
Max!

337
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:45,125
Hey, what's wrong with him?

338
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:46,083
Max.

339
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,500
- What… what did you do?
- Max?

340
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:49,958
Hey, Max. You okay?

341
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,500
Yeah, man, I'm fine.
I'm living my best life.

342
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,333
Are you crazy? Is he…

343
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,666
- Is he...
- He's dead. Yes, Daniel.

344
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,125
Yes, he's dead.

345
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:03,291
I killed him.

346
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,041
- No, you can't do this.
- No?

347
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:07,833
We're protected. This place is protected!

348
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:11,791
You're protected?
How protected do you feel right now?

349
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,750
Hmm?

350
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,041
Blaire, finish your drink.
We're running behind schedule.

351
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:19,791
- Hey. You stupid bitches.
- Mmm.

352
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,000
They're gonna come after you for this.
The bosses will burn you alive.

353
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,083
- Oh.
- Yeah.

354
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:26,791
You can't kill in here. It's off-limits.

355
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,208
Oh, are those the rules?

356
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,958
You can't. You're gonna ruin this place.

357
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:33,750
Well, that's the point.
No more happy endings.

358
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,416
No, wait, hey!

359
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,708
Wait, no, no, no. Don't, please, wait.

360
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:40,583
You can't kill me.
You can't. What about the truce?

361
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:44,041
- The truce is dead, handsome.
- Wait. Wait.

362
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,583
Hey, uh, officer, listen. Um, I…

363
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,291
I need… I need your help. I… I got this…

364
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,291
It's an emergency.
There's these two women, right?

365
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:10,958
- And they're after me and...
- Two women?

366
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,333
- Mm-hmm.
- After you?

367
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:16,291
Yeah, I've been… I've been driving them
around all night, but I think that's...

368
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,250
Is there anything
you want to tell me about, son?

369
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:21,791
- No, listen, I'm trying...
- How much have you had to drink tonight?

370
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,333
- I haven't drank anything.
- Any drugs?

371
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:24,541
- No drugs.
- Weapons on you?

372
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:27,250
Listen, there's
this secret floor in there, okay?

373
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,541
There's this crazy shit
that's going on in there.

374
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:32,458
I need you to call backup.
I need you to call everyone, call...

375
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:34,000
Exactly what'd you see up there?

376
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:39,708
They killed these two guys, all right?
They were drinking their blood, man.

377
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:42,125
Okay, that's enough.
Put your hands behind your back.

378
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:44,000
Put your hands behind your back!

379
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:44,916
Hey!

380
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:50,125
Come on. Take… take me to jail right now.

381
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,041
Get me… get me out of here.

382
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:53,500
Mm-hmm. Let's go.

383
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,375
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no.

384
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:59,000
- What happens upstairs stays upstairs.
- No. Okay.

385
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,583
- You should know better.
- Yeah, I'm not gonna say...

386
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,625
- Get in the trunk. In the trunk!
- I won't say nothing!

387
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:08,250
- I'm not gonna say anything!
- Excuse me, Officer Anderson.

388
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,291
You girls.

389
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:16,250
Yes, us girls.

390
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,833
This kid is saying
you killed two men upstairs.

391
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:24,041
- That can't be right, right?
- Of course not.

392
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,583
Benny here has no idea what he saw.

393
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:27,625
Do you, Benny?

394
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:31,375
We just gave those boys
the best suck they're ever gonna get.

395
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,000
Let him go. He's ours.

396
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,333
Yeah. Victor know about this?

397
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:38,958
What do you think, dipshit?

398
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:42,250
We're just making our collections.
Business as usual.

399
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:45,416
- Well, I didn't get a call.
- Oh, you didn't get a call?

400
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,333
Maybe you're not important enough
to get a call.

401
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:50,000
Yeah, maybe I should just call Victor now.

402
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:51,625
Why don't you do that?

403
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:56,750
I'm sure Victor would love to hear
from his favorite little piggy.

404
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,583
Hand him over.

405
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:06,833
Okay, all right. Fine.

406
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,125
Go turn the car around.

407
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:21,666
Huh? Hey!

408
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,291
No more funny games.

409
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:29,458
Wait! No.
Don't go! Wait! Don't leave!

410
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,833
Yeah.

411
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,291
Yeah, you count this out?

412
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,041
Back in the car, driver.

413
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,541
Hmm.

414
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:27,125
Don't get up. I know where the bar is.

415
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:30,375
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm having a drink with my bosses, Eva.

416
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,000
Better make it a good one.

417
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,708
- It's gonna be your last.
- I'll keep that in mind.

418
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:44,666
We told you what would happen
if you stepped foot in Boyle Heights,

419
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,000
and yet, here you are,

420
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:48,541
being reckless as ever.

421
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:49,833
Drinking blood cocktails

422
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,250
on white upholstery,
and I'm the reckless one?

423
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:56,291
You need to remember your place,
Victor. You're middle management.

424
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:59,416
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't call Martin right now.

425
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:05,125
- Because I've had a change of heart.
- What heart?

426
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,583
I deserve that.

427
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,958
This view never gets old.

428
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:26,458
Yeah. But now we're gonna have to ruin it
with your dead body.

429
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,750
I should have let her do
what she wanted with you.

430
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,916
I wanted to barbecue you
the moment you fed outside the lines.

431
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,708
But Grace said that would be impulsive.

432
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:39,458
I think the word I used was tacky.

433
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,625
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

434
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:45,458
I know you've never trusted me,
never given me any real power.

435
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:48,166
But if you hadn't tried
to run me out of my own city,

436
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,666
I wouldn't be seeing so clearly now.

437
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,250
- Are you on something?
- You violated the truce.

438
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,208
It's the one thing that's kept
our kind safe all these years,

439
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,416
and you just pissed on it.

440
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:06,666
For years we've been told
who to feed on and where

441
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,291
and treating humans
like they're our equals.

442
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:11,541
It started to feel like a prison.

443
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:15,625
So I got frustrated
and did something impulsive.

444
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,250
Should we say

445
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,000
tacky?

446
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:22,000
Tacky?

447
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,500
You fed where you weren't supposed to
and started a war with Jay Perez.

448
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,875
If he comes for us,
Boyle Heights will follow.

449
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:33,083
Do you like your fancy clothes
and your concrete mansion?

450
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:38,166
Because if we get exposed,
that all goes away. For all of us.

451
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:40,125
I know.

452
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,833
I put you two in a terrible position.

453
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:46,208
Do you think that I don't get frustrated?

454
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:51,208
Do you think that when my pool boy
leaves a leaf in the pool,

455
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:54,958
that I don't wanna string him upside down
and suck him dry?

456
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,625
But if I pitch a fit every time
somebody pisses me off,

457
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:00,791
what does that make me?

458
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:01,958
A man.

459
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,250
Stupid as shit.

460
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,333
Like I said.

461
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:07,625
I'm sorry.

462
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,125
No, a ban is a ban.

463
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:14,208
You're gonna have to do a lot better
than that if you want me to reverse it.

464
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,208
You know, forever is a very long time.

465
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,458
Give it 40, 50 years.

466
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:25,000
Who knows? Maybe this will blow over,
and you'll be able to come back.

467
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,708
Oh, I think you've misunderstood.

468
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,083
I'm not going anywhere.

469
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,666
In fact, my girls
are down there right now,

470
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,958
ripping your entire network apart
one neck at a time.

471
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:45,083
So, everything you see belongs to me.

472
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:48,250
After I kill both of you, of course.

473
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,750
Martin!

474
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:54,333
I, uh, think you might
have to speak up a little.

475
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,875
This is not real. This is…

476
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:06,458
Come on. She's here, then she's there.

477
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,625
- You need to calm down.
- Calm? Be calm?

478
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,166
- You want me to calm down?
- Yeah.

479
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,916
- I'm calm.
- Oh, you're calm?

480
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,125
- Yeah. This is me calm.
- This is you calm?

481
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,708
- You seem kind of worked up.
- What do you want me to do, huh?

482
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:27,750
I'm here… I'm here in this car with…
with you and whatever the hell you are.

483
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:29,166
Oh.

484
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,375
- This is… this is stupid.
- Oh, wow.

485
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,041
- I… I honestly...
- So dumb.

486
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:35,250
I don't expect people to understand.

487
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,208
- It's a lot. It's a lot.
- Yeah. Yeah.

488
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:39,708
Yeah, I mean, especially for you.

489
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,666
What is that supposed to mean, huh?

490
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,458
It means you're a kid.

491
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,458
Like, you…

492
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:51,958
You… you think majoring in economics
is gonna solve all your problems?

493
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:54,166
Do you think
that this is how the world works?

494
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,041
Okay. All right.

495
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,083
Well…

496
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,625
Don't worry.

497
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,916
It'll all be over soon.

498
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:04,500
All over? All over? How?

499
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:09,958
Is… is my brother… is he like a, um…

500
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,791
No, it's not like that.

501
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:17,083
Then what's it like, then? What's it like?

502
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:21,750
Let's just say your people
and my people don't really get along.

503
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,250
Who do you think runs the city?

504
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:29,458
Cops?

505
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:30,791
Politicians?

506
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,708
We do.

507
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:34,416
We?

508
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,416
Right.

509
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,833
And… and our kind, like your kind,
answer to leaders.

510
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,125
All right.

511
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:46,583
There are five bosses that control
most of the major territories of LA.

512
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:50,625
- It sounds like the mob.
- Please. We're not amateurs.

513
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,541
Victor's, what, like, your boss?

514
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:54,291
Your boyfriend?

515
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,000
Oh, twist. Benny's the jealous type.

516
00:41:57,083 --> 00:42:00,416
No, no, no. I just…
I don't… I don't know what's going on.

517
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,875
So, Zoé and Victor are together.

518
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:06,000
And then, Zoé's my girl.

519
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,208
So, she and I manage money

520
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:10,458
at the different businesses
and blood clubs.

521
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:12,500
- We manage the...
- Blood clubs?

522
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:16,333
Yeah, but Victor's sick
of not having any real power,

523
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:20,291
so tonight, we're making our move.

524
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,250
The problem is you can't make a move
against one of the bosses

525
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,958
without the rest of them
coming for your head unless you...

526
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:30,083
Unless you take them all out
at the same time. Same night.

527
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:31,666
Exactly.

528
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:34,166
And… and my brother?

529
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,875
Jay's crew runs Boyle Heights.

530
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,541
They know what we are and how to kill us.

531
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:44,958
Victor thought he could use him.

532
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:49,083
Just turn Jay's crew loose on the bosses.

533
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:52,958
Jay kindly instructed him to go to hell,

534
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:56,500
which Victor didn't like very much,
so the plan was for us

535
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:59,541
to bring Jay to Victor
after all of this was done.

536
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:01,791
That was the plan

537
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,375
until you showed up.

538
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:08,500
So, Benny, you know
where your brother is tonight?

539
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:28,250
Hey, no, you can't smoke that in here.
It's gonna…

540
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:30,625
It's gonna get in the leather.

541
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,166
That's funny.

542
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:39,875
Mmm.

543
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:42,291
You wanna hit this?

544
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:45,875
- Honestly, it might make you feel better.
- No, I'm… I'm okay.

545
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,125
Here. Let me.

546
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:06,125
So, how did it go?

547
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,333
<i>Well, my shirt is ruined.</i>

548
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:10,416
<i>I think we might actually pull this off.</i>

549
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,458
Yeah.

550
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:13,000
Three bosses down.

551
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,708
<i>And two to go.</i>

552
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:17,250
Ah, you should've seen
the looks on their faces.

553
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:19,416
<i> I wish</i>
<i>I could've been there with you.</i>

554
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:22,000
<i>So, how's Jay?</i>

555
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:24,083
Yeah.

556
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:26,458
About that.
I… I need to tell you something.

557
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:27,916
<i> What is it?</i>

558
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,208
We, um, got his little brother instead.

559
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:37,166
<i>I'm sorry. We didn't know.</i>

560
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,583
It's okay, baby.

561
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:41,750
It's okay. We can use the brother.

562
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:43,416
Really?

563
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,375
<i>Really. It makes it more fun.</i>
<i>Think of him like insurance.</i>

564
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:49,041
<i>Okay, babe.</i>

565
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:52,791
- Do you think he gives good blood?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

566
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:55,708
I think he gives real good blood.

567
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,625
I'll take care of Jay.
I don't want you to get distracted.

568
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:05,083
Clear downtown and Venice.
Then the city is ours.

569
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:08,250
We can't let them regroup after tonight.

570
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:17,958
You sure about this? I don't like him.

571
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,833
I don't even like breathing
the same air as this<i> vato.</i>

572
00:45:20,916 --> 00:45:22,666
This is the only chance we got.

573
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,625
What if we don't know where Victor's at?

574
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,833
Gio made Victor.

575
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:29,541
He'll know.

576
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:33,750
- I want him alive.
- All right.

577
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:50,458
Shit.

578
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,291
What the hell happened in here?

579
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:03,166
Sweep the house.

580
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:06,041
Split up. Three and three.

581
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:07,166
Watch out.

582
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,750
Don't move. Move, I gotta put
this knife through your heart.

583
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:33,291
I don't think you want that, do you, Gio?

584
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:37,000
Right, baby. I don't want that.

585
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:38,416
Yo, what the hell happened to you?

586
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,958
Oh, don't look at me.
I look hideous.

587
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:43,208
- You know what I need?
- Hmm?

588
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:46,458
I need some blood.
Can you get me some blood, Jay?

589
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:48,500
First, you gotta tell me
where Victor's at tonight.

590
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:50,375
That snake.

591
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:52,875
He's coming for all of us.

592
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:56,000
All the bosses.
All the territories.

593
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:58,250
He's clearing the board.

594
00:46:58,333 --> 00:46:59,625
Victor did this?

595
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:01,041
His girls did this.

596
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,458
- You know the ones.
- Haven't had the pleasure.

597
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:08,541
His little monsters
left me like this to suffer.

598
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,083
Hey. Hey, wake up.
Rise and shine, come on.

599
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:13,208
- I'm awake.
- Where were they going?

600
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:15,416
I'll tell you if you give me some blood.

601
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,208
You gotta tell me what they said first.

602
00:47:18,416 --> 00:47:21,000
Three Kings.

603
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,750
Get the boys. We're going downtown.

604
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:26,875
But first, give me some blood!

605
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:54,000
Can you hear that?

606
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,958
What did I just smoke? I…

607
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:00,541
I feel weird.

608
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:02,375
Angel dust.

609
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,250
- What?
- Relax.

610
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,208
- I'm joking.
- Are you?

611
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:10,250
Uh, maybe. Maybe not.

612
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:13,458
Ask Blaire. She rolled it.

613
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:18,416
That girl really needs to get laid.

614
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:25,000
Well, that's a different kind of service
than the one this car company offers, but…

615
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:28,708
That's good, Benny.

616
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:31,166
Can I call you Benny Boy?

617
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:32,750
No.

618
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:39,083
You know, it's not your fault
that she likes you.

619
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:43,708
She likes everyone,
so don't feel special or anything.

620
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:47,250
Yeah, I know,
it's not… it's not like that.

621
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:50,250
I… I mean, I'm not…
I'm not saying she isn't attractive.

622
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:53,833
I'm just not really looking
for a relationship right now.

623
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:55,250
Is he looking at me?

624
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:58,750
Who?

625
00:48:58,833 --> 00:48:59,916
The clerk.

626
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:04,041
I… I don't think so.

627
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:05,083
You sure?

628
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:06,083
Yeah, you know.

629
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,541
Nobody's looking at you, Zoé.

630
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:09,875
He's calling someone.

631
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,041
Zoé.

632
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:14,666
Zoé, chill, yo. Hey. Chill.

633
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:18,166
<i>…three bodies appeared
to have been drained of all blood.</i>

634
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,583
Wait.

635
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:20,875
Just a slushy?

636
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,333
- Yeah, just the slushy.
- Okay.

637
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:25,708
- Is that…
- Okay, that's gonna be two...

638
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:29,750
Who was on the phone?

639
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,666
- Do we really have to do this?
- Take the money!

640
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,666
Get out of here, okay?
I don't want any trouble!

641
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,833
You a tattletale?

642
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:37,625
What? You're insane!

643
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,208
- Get her off of me! Do something!
- Just do what she says, man.

644
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:42,625
- Who was on the phone?
- It was my mom!

645
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:46,500
Okay? She just wanted me to pick up
more cat food on the way home from work.

646
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:50,291
I swear to God. I just…
Jesus Christ, are those…

647
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:51,416
Shut him up!

648
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,625
Shut him up?
What do you mean, shut him up? No!

649
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:58,708
That's my girl.

650
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:00,333
Let's go.

651
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,833
What?

652
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:07,791
What is wrong with you?

653
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:11,875
You can't be alive for 200 years
and not go a little crazy.

654
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,625
What should we do with Benny?

655
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:47,875
I mean,
we can't just leave him in the car.

656
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:50,666
Hey, so, um, listen,
I… I got this idea, right?

657
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,250
And I… I was thinking,
maybe why don't I just go?

658
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,416
You guys can just take the car,

659
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,000
and… and… and… and I'll find my way home.
I'll find a bus.

660
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:01,375
- It sounds like you're trying to ditch us.
- No, I'm not...

661
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:05,833
Hey, you know what? I actually think
that's a really smart idea.

662
00:51:05,916 --> 00:51:07,083
Yeah?

663
00:51:07,166 --> 00:51:08,125
Yeah.

664
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:11,250
Yeah. You know,
'cause, you know, all… all this shit,

665
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:13,666
I'm not gonna say nothing about all this.

666
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:17,958
I just think this is a time where I feel
like we should go our separate ways,

667
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:21,166
and… and believe me, it was…
it was great meeting you guys, you know.

668
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:24,708
- It was great meeting you too.
- And the secrets, they're safe with me.

669
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:26,333
- It's me, you know.
- Okay.

670
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,416
Well, if he says
he's not gonna say anything,

671
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,000
then we can trust him.

672
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:31,958
Right?

673
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:34,666
Sweet. Uh, okay, great. I mean...

674
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,375
You're gonna stick around
a little while longer, Benny Boy.

675
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:39,583
We're not quite through.

676
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:42,833
You remember what I did
to that guy at the hotel?

677
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:48,166
I tore his neck open like a bag of candy.

678
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:51,625
If you do anything stupid inside,

679
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,541
I'll start stacking bodies.

680
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,666
I think what she's trying to say,

681
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,375
Benny, is we would love
if you came with us.

682
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:02,125
Good?

683
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:05,875
Fun! Fun!

684
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,791
Hey, uh, your friend over there?

685
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:13,291
Yeah, she's insane.
I'm talking next-level crazy.

686
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:15,958
Yeah. You wanna stay out of her way. Okay?

687
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:18,291
I gotta get out of here.
I can't do this shit.

688
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:21,791
I need you to be smart. All right?
If you do anything stupid,

689
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:24,375
like try and run or tell anyone about us,

690
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:28,250
I'm gonna have to kill you. Okay?
And I don't want to have to do that.

691
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:29,708
- Bruce!
- Hey.

692
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:33,125
You don't want to have to kill me.
Great, I mean, that's fantastic.

693
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:34,500
I'm looking out for you.

694
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:37,916
- You call this looking out for somebody?
- Benny! Come on.

695
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,750
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

696
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,666
- Benny?
- Go on, man.

697
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:44,833
Oh, no way.

698
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:48,666
Hey, um, do you think
you could help us out?

699
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,875
You know, tell them
that we're your friends.

700
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:53,750
Like, we're with you or something?

701
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,000
Please?

702
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:58,083
Sorry, I don't know. I… I just, uh…

703
00:52:58,166 --> 00:53:01,166
He can't help you because he is the help.

704
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:04,458
I mean, look at him.
Looks like a butler or something.

705
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:05,666
Uh…

706
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,083
Oh shit.

707
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:09,250
I was right?

708
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:36,708
Benny has his hands full tonight.

709
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,458
Maybe find someone else to leech onto.

710
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:43,083
Do us a favor.

711
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:45,375
Send the Gen Z
off to the back of the line.

712
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:47,791
Back of the line. Let's go.

713
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:49,083
- You kidding?
- Wait. No.

714
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:51,208
- You heard me. Not tonight.
- Look, no...

715
00:53:57,041 --> 00:53:58,333
What are you looking at?

716
00:53:58,958 --> 00:54:01,458
I don't think
I've ever met anybody like you.

717
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:05,833
Well, don't get weird.
I was just trying to make you look cool.

718
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:08,750
Yeah, well, it worked.

719
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,416
I don't know why you care what they think.

720
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,333
I don't.

721
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,166
You're never gonna remember their faces.
They're insignificant.

722
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,666
What does that make me?

723
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,125
I guess we're gonna have to find out.

724
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,041
Whoa.

725
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:37,166
Busy night.

726
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,708
Yeah.
And not a lot of friendly faces.

727
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:41,375
Let's keep this cool and quiet.

728
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:44,041
- I hate going in quiet.
- Zoé.

729
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:46,250
You wanna get the bag, I'll get Big Lou?

730
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:47,416
Mm-hmm.

731
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:50,583
It might get a little messy in there.

732
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:54,958
Drink up. You won't feel a thing.

733
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:01,458
There'll be
a lot of sharp teeth in there.

734
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:04,333
Nobody makes a move
until we see Victor's girls, all right?

735
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:05,791
Y'all hear that?

736
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:31,958
Good evening, ladies.

737
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:33,916
Who are you? Where's Big Lou?

738
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,875
Big Lou is no longer with us.

739
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:39,083
Don't you recognize me?

740
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:42,666
I don't think we've had the pleasure.

741
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,125
I don't like this. We should move.

742
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,625
We're not going anywhere yet.

743
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:10,458
Lost a lot of friends
to things like you.

744
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:13,083
You don't remember me?

745
00:56:13,791 --> 00:56:15,041
Remember what?

746
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:19,500
I gave you that,
but I didn't get to finish the job.

747
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:21,791
LA was always off-limits.

748
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:25,250
Yeah, I think it's brave
what you're doing,

749
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,750
stepping out on your own like this.

750
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:30,208
But, if you break the rules,

751
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:32,791
you lose certain protections.

752
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:37,416
I mean, with the truce falling apart,
it's open season on you freaks.

753
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:39,625
See my friend here?

754
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,375
She can drain your whole body
before you even pull the trigger.

755
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:48,708
You think I'm here alone?

756
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,416
Oh…

757
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,541
What were you saying?

758
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:55,791
Ah. Look at them.

759
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:57,958
For once,

760
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:00,708
they're helpless.

761
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:09,750
Kill them.

762
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:40,958
Who still uses crossbows?

763
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:43,708
Night Legion.

764
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:51,583
- What?
- You asked who still uses crossbows.

765
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:54,791
Night Legion does.
They like to hunt things like us.

766
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:56,625
They've been at it for centuries.

767
00:58:57,416 --> 00:59:02,458
And Benny, like, totally bottles them
in the face, apparently.

768
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:03,666
Yes, he does.

769
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:08,083
Come on.
These scumbags are like cockroaches.

770
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:12,125
When there's one, there's many.

771
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,250
Benny!

772
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,791
Is there a problem?

773
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:24,166
- You know you're not allowed to be here.
- Move.

774
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:26,083
No.

775
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:42,625
Oh shit!

776
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:51,833
- We gotta get off the streets.
- Yeah, we need to lay low.

777
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:53,875
Is there some place safe you could take us?

778
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:55,833
No. We're not going anywhere
until I find out

779
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:58,000
where this Victor is
and what he wants from my brother.

780
01:00:58,083 --> 01:00:59,541
Well, look at you.

781
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:02,708
Benny Boy. Making demands
like he's running the show tonight.

782
01:01:03,208 --> 01:01:04,583
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

783
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:07,375
I like you, Benny.
I think you're kind of sweet,

784
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:10,083
so I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

785
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:13,750
Victor's gonna find Jay tonight,
and when he does, well…

786
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:15,208
Well? Well, what?

787
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:18,625
Well, if you stick with us,
then maybe we could get to Jay first,

788
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
and we could convince Victor
to go easy on him.
So, Benny, what's it gonna be?
You wanna see your brother,
or you wanna piss off?
Shit!

789
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:29,000
Run!

790
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:46,250
Come on! Try and get me, dickheads!

791
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,125
Crazy night, huh?

792
01:02:11,791 --> 01:02:13,583
Tell him to put his gear down.

793
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:19,375
It's all right.

794
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:23,666
You see the light now, don't you?
I heard what they did to your girl.

795
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:28,166
I know what that's like.
We all do. That's why we're out here.

796
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,000
We got resources. We got a network.

797
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:32,708
Wake up, Jay.
You can't beat them on your own.

798
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,875
Yeah, I don't wanna beat them.

799
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,166
I want Victor.

800
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:39,958
Okay.

801
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,583
If you survive the night,

802
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:45,083
come find me.

803
01:02:54,083 --> 01:02:55,416
Hey, uh, Benny?

804
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:58,875
Are you sure that we're safe here?

805
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,583
Yeah, of course. Nowhere safer.
I've lived here my whole life.

806
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:05,250
- I know, I just meant maybe...
- Listen, um…

807
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:08,208
So, my grandma works nights,
but sometimes she comes home early.

808
01:03:08,291 --> 01:03:12,083
So, all I'm asking
is that you guys be quiet, please.

809
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:13,625
- I got it. Yes.
- You got it?

810
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:16,083
We will be on our best behavior.

811
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:18,000
Right, Zoé?

812
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Well, this is quaint.
- Shh.
Hey! It's me!

813
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:38,541
Oh my God!
I almost killed you!

814
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:41,250
All day by myself!
If you're gonna be studying...

815
01:03:42,791 --> 01:03:43,750
Hello.

816
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:48,208
Can you please put the bat down? Please?

817
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,583
- Where have you been?
- I...

818
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:53,958
These two
don't look like college students.

819
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:56,375
Look, I…
I lost my phone and, uh…

820
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,958
Blaire, Zoé, this is my grandma, Rosa.

821
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:02,583
Grandma, this is Blaire and… and Zoé.

822
01:04:03,166 --> 01:04:04,250
- 'Sup?
- Hey.

823
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:07,958
Okay. Good night now. Have a nice evening.

824
01:04:09,583 --> 01:04:11,458
Listen, they're waiting for a ride,

825
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:14,250
so I was thinking maybe they could,
you know, wait here a bit.

826
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,958
What happened to your hand?

827
01:04:16,041 --> 01:04:18,125
No, it's fine.
I'll get a Band-Aid...

828
01:04:18,208 --> 01:04:19,791
What Band-Aid? No Band-Aid!

829
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:22,458
- You're gonna need stitches!
- Ma, it's okay. It's okay.

830
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,625
Who did this to you?

831
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:29,041
Nothing. It was an accident.

832
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:32,333
Yo, that was a bloodbath, G.

833
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:36,333
We keep going like this,
it's suicide for sure.

834
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:43,375
Damn.

835
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:00,833
Hands on the dash.
Eyes forward.

836
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:06,083
You. You got any weapons
or drugs in the vehicle?

837
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:07,750
No, sir.

838
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:09,500
Hey. Hands.

839
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:12,375
- My ID.
- I don't need to see that.

840
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:14,375
I know who the two of you are.

841
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:17,666
Victor would like to meet for a drink.

842
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:19,041
Rosso Puro.

843
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,125
Thirty minutes.

844
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,333
We're free to go?

845
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:24,250
Oh yeah. I almost forgot.

846
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:25,958
Benny says hi.

847
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:34,791
How did this happen to you?

848
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:37,375
Grandma, that is a long story.

849
01:05:38,541 --> 01:05:40,625
But I swear I'll tell you later.

850
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:41,583
Okay?

851
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:43,500
Do they speak Spanish?

852
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:44,625
I don't know.

853
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:48,458
Is this little Benny?

854
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:49,916
Yo, put that back.

855
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,500
No. It's so good.

856
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:53,541
You know,

857
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:57,083
Benny's never brought a girl home before.

858
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:59,458
- Let alone two.
<i>- Abuela,</i> seriously?

859
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:00,791
What?

860
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:05,125
Can I help you out with that?

861
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:08,625
I… That's okay.

862
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:11,041
I… I think we're fine here.

863
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,166
Thank you, dear.

864
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:34,000
Yeah, all right,
you know what? I think we're good here.

865
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:37,083
You know, I feel good.
Hand feels good. Uh…

866
01:06:37,166 --> 01:06:39,666
You… uh, you… you… you feel good?

867
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:43,750
Do I feel good? You woke me up
in the middle of the night, Benny.

868
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:47,833
I'm… I'm sorry, but maybe
you should get back to sleep?

869
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:52,708
I like this one better
than the other one.

870
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:57,291
But be careful.
I don't need great-grandchildren.

871
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:00,750
Good evening, Rosa.

872
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:02,125
It was a pleasure.

873
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:10,916
- <i>What's wrong, baby?</i>
- We got jumped downtown.

874
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,125
Night Legion was all over us.

875
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:15,000
<i>At least they took care of Big Lou.</i>

876
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,041
How many did you kill?

877
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:17,958
<i>Three.</i>

878
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:21,625
<i>Maybe four. Boyle Heights was there too.</i>

879
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:25,083
<i> I thought you said</i>
<i>you were gonna take care of Jay.</i>

880
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,208
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>I'm on my way to meet Jay.</i>

881
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:29,583
<i>Just stopped for a drink.</i>

882
01:07:29,666 --> 01:07:30,541
Okay.

883
01:07:31,833 --> 01:07:34,750
I don't know. I'm getting worried.

884
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:37,750
<i>This night's going sideways.</i>

885
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:40,083
We can't stop now. We're nearly done.

886
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:43,916
I'm gonna drain the kid.
I'm gonna smother the grandma,

887
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:46,166
and we can hit Venice tomorrow.

888
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:49,708
<i>We need to clear Venice tonight.</i>
<i>Rocko is too unpredictable.</i>

889
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:52,416
If we mess this up,
there will be no tomorrow.

890
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,750
Venice is the last kill.

891
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,791
I know you can do it.

892
01:07:56,875 --> 01:07:59,625
Just keep a hold of the kid,
and we'll party at dawn.

893
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,541
The world will be ours, babe,

894
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,375
just me and you.

895
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:08,875
Yeah.

896
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,541
Let's get it done.

897
01:08:12,041 --> 01:08:13,166
Now,

898
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:15,916
where were we?

899
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:28,458
It's kind of cool.

900
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,250
Huh.

901
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:37,791
All right.

902
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:53,791
This is super cool.

903
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:56,333
Yeah, all right.

904
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:58,041
You… you can put that down.

905
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:00,041
Sorry.

906
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:02,500
This is all just leftover
from when I was a kid.

907
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:06,333
I was gonna get rid of all of this stuff.
I haven't really had the time to upgrade...

908
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:08,416
Yes. Did you build all of this?

909
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,666
Yeah, but you know,
can we just maybe turn this down...

910
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,791
Mm-mm. No.

911
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,291
Why not?

912
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:18,458
'Cause I like it.

913
01:09:19,541 --> 01:09:20,833
I think it's really good.

914
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:26,333
I mean, I'm assuming
B's Session Number Three, that's you?

915
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:30,250
Oh yeah. You know,
this is actually… it's a… it's a classic.

916
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,458
Oh, this is a classic?

917
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:33,375
Oh yeah, yeah. Everyone says so.

918
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:35,041
- Oh, everyone says so?
- Mm-hmm.

919
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:36,500
People, like who?

920
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:40,125
You know, people like… my grandma?

921
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:42,458
Yeah.

922
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:45,500
So, when are you gonna play this
for other people?

923
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:50,833
Well, I'm planning on it. I… I want
to do something… something with this.

924
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:53,791
It's more than fun.
I wanna turn it into something real.

925
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,458
And when I do, you know,

926
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:59,875
then you could tell people
that you're my first fan.

927
01:09:59,958 --> 01:10:02,458
- So, in a way, you're welcome.
- Oh, I can?

928
01:10:02,541 --> 01:10:04,500
Yeah, you know, if you want.

929
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,583
Well, I mean, for what it's worth,

930
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:10,041
I believe you. It's really good.

931
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:12,041
You're really talented.

932
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,458
And you're a very good driver.

933
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:16,666
- Thanks.
- Mmm.

934
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:20,750
Well, what… what about you?

935
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,125
What about me?

936
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:26,791
You know, is there anything that you like?
Anything you're passionate about?

937
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:31,500
I mean, like, in a past life.

938
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:36,708
Zoé and I are always talking
about, like, the shit we're gonna do.

939
01:10:36,791 --> 01:10:39,250
- You know?
- When did you two meet?

940
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:41,291
Um…

941
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:44,875
She had this place
in Laurel Canyon in the '70s,

942
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:46,708
and she would throw these parties.

943
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:49,125
So, they would go
for like three or four days.

944
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:51,291
Everyone was there. And she loved Bowie,

945
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:54,083
so she had this, like…
the Bowie haircut, you know.

946
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,375
She was cool, man.
The queen bitch, that was her.

947
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:58,166
Yeah, that checks out.

948
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:02,791
And I was, like, just like a stray
when I first moved here,

949
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:06,500
and I didn't feel like I fit anywhere.

950
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,916
And it was like she saw me.

951
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:14,125
She told me everything could be beautiful.

952
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,166
She said a bunch of stuff.

953
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:22,333
And then she turned me,

954
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:25,000
and she gave me this life.

955
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:34,041
Honestly, you should take this
to a producer.

956
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:36,125
- Yeah.
- You could make real money.

957
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:39,333
I know, I know, it's just
I don't think it's where it has to be yet.

958
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:41,166
Where does it have to be?
What's it missing?

959
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,458
It's missing a little something
before it becomes like a...

960
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,250
- Like, what? A classic?
- Yeah.

961
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Mmm.
- Yeah, a classic.

962
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,041
We need to leave.

963
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:57,416
Yeah. Cool.

964
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,625
Hi.

965
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:06,583
We're done with Benny, right?
He can stay here.

966
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:07,833
I don't think so.

967
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:12,583
- Well, this has nothing to do with him.
- He's coming. That's how it's gotta be.

968
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:15,500
Why are you being like this?

969
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,875
Do you want to be the one to tell Victor?

970
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Hey.

971
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:27,416
I'm coming with you.

972
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:29,708
Good.

973
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Let's go.

974
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:36,875
Anything happens to me,

975
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:39,250
you take care of Benny.

976
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:41,958
You protect him.

977
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:44,333
Consider it done.

978
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:01,958
Where's Benny?

979
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:07,416
Jay. So glad you could make it.

980
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,833
You put a hand on him or Maria,
I swear to God...

981
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:12,833
Is that her name? We'll get to her.

982
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:14,875
But first, sit.

983
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,875
- Where are they?
- Sit.

984
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:24,916
It's funny to think, though.

985
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,958
Almost a hundred years ago,

986
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:30,875
my kind sat across from your kind,

987
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:32,916
much like you and I right now.

988
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,458
And then they came up with that truce.

989
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,291
Well, you broke that truce.

990
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:41,000
You took people from my neighborhood.

991
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:42,750
Innocent people.

992
01:13:43,458 --> 01:13:45,541
Did you think we were gonna let
you get away with that?

993
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:49,333
We? Who's this "we" you're talking about?

994
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:53,333
Everyone's gone. I had them all killed.

995
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:58,416
You should have taken my offer.
Now it's all going to be mine.

996
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,166
You see, you're the last piece.

997
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:07,458
Once you're gone,
this city's just one fat neck

998
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:09,958
waiting to get sucked.

999
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:11,875
You want me?

1000
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,250
Fine. Fair game.

1001
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,375
Maria and Benny
have nothing to do with this.

1002
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:20,458
Let them go.

1003
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:25,458
That's not how this is going to go.
Nobody walks.

1004
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:27,791
You know that.

1005
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:37,000
How do I look? Do I look okay?

1006
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:41,916
Do you want some?

1007
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,791
I saved her for you.

1008
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:45,708
Your sweet Maria.

1009
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:46,625
What?

1010
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,958
I saved her for you, Jay.

1011
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:52,916
No. No.

1012
01:14:53,583 --> 01:14:55,583
Don't go soft on me now.

1013
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,375
We haven't even gotten started yet.

1014
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,208
Last kill.

1015
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:27,083
Let's do this.

1016
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,958
Maybe lean close. This guy's a freak.

1017
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:51,125
Look what the night dragged in.

1018
01:15:51,916 --> 01:15:53,583
Couple of strays.

1019
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:56,125
Good morning, Rocko.

1020
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:58,708
No such thing as a good morning.

1021
01:15:58,791 --> 01:16:00,250
Mmm, maybe not for you.

1022
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:06,000
I don't know you, do I?

1023
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,708
No, but I'm… I'm with them.

1024
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:12,000
That doesn't really change
your problem, amigo.

1025
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:17,875
- I don't know you.
- Don't worry about him. He's cool.

1026
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:19,291
Yeah, chill, he's with us.

1027
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,125
You cool?

1028
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,291
Cool, dude.

1029
01:16:29,416 --> 01:16:30,416
Rough night?

1030
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:36,166
You look a little, uh, banged up, bro.

1031
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:40,166
Yeah, I'm… I'm a little banged up, bro.

1032
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:52,875
Oh, I'm just messing with you, man!
I'm goofing!

1033
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:55,250
<i>Mi casa es su casa!</i>

1034
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:57,708
Enter at your leisure.

1035
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,083
- Madam.
- Mmm.

1036
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:18,041
Oh, you smell nice.

1037
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:21,333
You give good blood, don't you?

1038
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:23,250
I can tell.

1039
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:26,458
I have a nose for these things.

1040
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:30,000
I see things, man.

1041
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:32,291
Visions.

1042
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:37,958
Some people say
I'm like a… like a psychic or something.

1043
01:17:38,041 --> 01:17:40,791
- Yeah, I… I bet they do say that.
- They do.

1044
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:44,041
Rocko.

1045
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:45,583
Yes?

1046
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:47,208
Not this one.

1047
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:53,041
Oh, whatever, man.
I'm not into virgins. You know that.

1048
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:57,166
- I'm… I'm not even a...
- Hey. Don't lie, man.

1049
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,041
Third eye sees all.

1050
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:07,333
This is weird.

1051
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:11,833
You guys didn't call.
You showed up unannounced.

1052
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:16,333
Is this like a booty call or something?

1053
01:18:16,416 --> 01:18:18,125
I'm not that kind of girl.

1054
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:21,375
We just wanted
to surprise you, Rocko.

1055
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:25,000
What, you don't like surprises anymore?

1056
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,541
You know I love surprises.

1057
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:31,375
Surprises are tight.

1058
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:37,083
Do you want to leave us for a minute?

1059
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:39,250
Yeah.

1060
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:41,083
Yeah, why don't you guys, uh,

1061
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,958
leave us to it for the minute
and go out to the pool?

1062
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:48,708
Let the grown-ups, uh, conversate.

1063
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:55,666
We'll be out there soon.

1064
01:18:58,166 --> 01:18:59,791
Bye, virgin.

1065
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:04,083
Drink?

1066
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:13,041
What?

1067
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:17,958
I don't know how you could be
so chill about all this.

1068
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:19,416
You know? It's like,

1069
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:23,791
you're out here every night
doing this <i>Kill Bill-</i>type shit.

1070
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,125
It's crazy.

1071
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:28,041
- It's kind of… it's kind of crazy.
- It's not every night.

1072
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:29,750
- It's not?
- No.

1073
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:34,416
If I'm still alive tomorrow,
I am sleeping all day.

1074
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:37,458
- Mmm.
- Sounds nice.

1075
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:38,500
Mmm.

1076
01:19:39,666 --> 01:19:40,583
It is.

1077
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:47,625
What's it like?

1078
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:49,291
Hmm?

1079
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:51,791
You know.

1080
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:56,625
Honestly…

1081
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:01,416
Sometimes it feels awesome.

1082
01:20:02,208 --> 01:20:03,500
You can do whatever you want.

1083
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,041
You don't have to hold back.

1084
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:08,208
You're completely free.

1085
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:11,958
Sometimes.

1086
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:16,208
I just killed this dude an hour ago.

1087
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:17,916
Mm-hmm.

1088
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,291
Fresh type O.

1089
01:20:21,791 --> 01:20:22,833
Clean blood.

1090
01:20:26,416 --> 01:20:27,250
Can't beat it.

1091
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:31,958
Cheers.

1092
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:40,541
So,

1093
01:20:42,041 --> 01:20:44,375
what's with the late-night hang?

1094
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:48,083
You girls never cross the 405.

1095
01:20:48,166 --> 01:20:50,791
We were in the neighborhood.
Figured we'd stop by.

1096
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:53,166
Knew you'd be up late.

1097
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:15,500
So, you got any family?

1098
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:18,458
I got Zoé.

1099
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:20,375
She's got me.

1100
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:21,875
No, but like…

1101
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:24,916
like real family.

1102
01:21:31,416 --> 01:21:32,625
You know, my, uh…

1103
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,583
My grandma scooped me up
after my mom passed,

1104
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:41,500
and it was me, and it was her,

1105
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:43,250
and it was Jay.

1106
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:45,083
And Jay, he… he…

1107
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:49,041
He took care of me.

1108
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:51,750
He… he didn't have to.

1109
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:54,916
You know, he's… he's just my half brother,

1110
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:59,041
but he's… he's like
the only father I've ever had.

1111
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:01,375
I'm sorry.

1112
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:08,541
You're not like her, you know? Like Zoé.

1113
01:22:11,708 --> 01:22:13,375
I mean, I… I see you, you're…

1114
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:15,916
You're alive.

1115
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:29,208
Can I ask you something?

1116
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:33,625
Are you gonna kill me?

1117
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:40,583
No.

1118
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,416
I don't want you like that.

1119
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:11,916
So how come
you never come to visit anymore?

1120
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:15,625
We had a good thing going back then.

1121
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:20,875
Reagan was president.

1122
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:23,125
Shit, it was that long ago?

1123
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:25,125
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

1124
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,083
Time flies.

1125
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:35,166
What?

1126
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:40,083
What?

1127
01:23:41,666 --> 01:23:43,041
Is something wrong?

1128
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:46,333
No. No. Nothing wrong.

1129
01:23:48,208 --> 01:23:51,333
Oh, it just hit me.
Maybe just this one thing.

1130
01:23:52,791 --> 01:23:54,625
The part where you and Victor

1131
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:57,333
decide to kill and steal
from your own blood.

1132
01:23:58,083 --> 01:24:00,375
You wicked bitch.

1133
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:01,708
Oh, you bloodsucker.

1134
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,333
What?

1135
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,666
- I have to tell you something.
- What happened?

1136
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:17,583
Your brother. Victor has him.

1137
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,166
Benny, get the car.

1138
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:52,583
Tango down!

1139
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:38,625
Drive! Drive!

1140
01:25:57,125 --> 01:25:59,208
Babe, you're okay. We did it.

1141
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:01,625
I'm sorry.

1142
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:04,166
The night's over.

1143
01:26:05,166 --> 01:26:07,166
We'll go home, and you'll be okay.

1144
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:09,500
Benny, she needs blood.

1145
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:14,041
Oh God.

1146
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:16,500
We have to get to the last stop.

1147
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:19,333
Okay. Okay.

1148
01:26:46,916 --> 01:26:50,125
- Okay, let's get her inside.
- No. Hey, you take the car and run.

1149
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:52,375
- Okay?
- What are you talking about?

1150
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:53,833
This is Victor's house.

1151
01:26:55,291 --> 01:26:57,708
Okay, and he has Jay,
so I'm not going anywhere.

1152
01:26:57,791 --> 01:27:00,958
I'm sorry. Okay?
I'm sorry, I am. But it's too late.

1153
01:27:01,041 --> 01:27:05,166
No, it's not too late. If there's a chance
that he's in there, then I'm going in!

1154
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:08,250
You're dead the second you go in there.
Don't you understand?

1155
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,458
Not if you help me.

1156
01:27:13,916 --> 01:27:14,750
It's over.

1157
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:17,208
Promise me.

1158
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:21,125
Okay. Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

1159
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:23,833
You're good.
All right. Ready? Ready?

1160
01:27:24,666 --> 01:27:25,750
Okay. Come on.

1161
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:57,541
Jay.

1162
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:00,791
Jay.

1163
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:02,708
Jay.

1164
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:03,708
Hey, Jay.

1165
01:29:03,791 --> 01:29:07,250
Hey. Hey, yo, Jay.
Hey, it's me. It's Benny, hey.

1166
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:12,208
You see me? Hey.

1167
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:14,708
I'mma get you out.

1168
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'mma… I'mma…
I'mma get you out of here.
I'mma get you out.

1169
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:32,500
Look who's decided to join us.

1170
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:33,958
Benny.

1171
01:29:34,041 --> 01:29:38,083
Did you miss us? You missed us.

1172
01:29:38,166 --> 01:29:39,750
I'm sensing some tension here.

1173
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,958
Yeah, Benny's had a busy night.

1174
01:29:43,041 --> 01:29:47,041
I've heard so much about you.
Why don't you join us? Take a seat.

1175
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:49,291
- I'd rather stand.
- Oh.

1176
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:52,333
So, tell us, Benny.
What are you doing here?

1177
01:29:52,416 --> 01:29:53,875
I'd like to make a deal.

1178
01:29:54,541 --> 01:29:57,625
Let Jay go. Take me instead.

1179
01:29:59,416 --> 01:30:01,041
It's an interesting proposal.

1180
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:03,083
Benny.

1181
01:30:03,791 --> 01:30:04,625
Hey, Blaire.

1182
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:06,875
What's wrong?

1183
01:30:06,958 --> 01:30:08,291
I didn't say anything.

1184
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:10,583
Benny, have you ever tried fresh blood?

1185
01:30:11,541 --> 01:30:13,458
There's nothing like it.

1186
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,125
I remember when I first came here.

1187
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,958
The blood tastes different.

1188
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:24,291
I had to get used to it.

1189
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:27,750
I had to develop my palate.

1190
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:30,500
Now I can't get enough.

1191
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:38,833
After considering your proposal,
unfortunately,

1192
01:30:38,916 --> 01:30:40,416
I'm going to have to decline.

1193
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:43,625
But here's my counteroffer.

1194
01:30:44,166 --> 01:30:46,750
Because I run things now,

1195
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:48,541
you will be our appetizer.

1196
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:55,083
Jay will be our main course.
And I think I'll save <i>abuela</i> for dessert.

1197
01:30:57,083 --> 01:31:00,625
Hey! Don't you fucking touch him!
What are you doing? He saved us tonight.

1198
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:02,750
Well, then I guess
we'll make it quick, then.

1199
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:05,375
Hold him down. It's time to drink.

1200
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,750
- Don't.
- Oh. This is interesting.

1201
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:11,000
She's just confused.

1202
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:13,500
- You're not confused, are you?
- Not at all, actually.

1203
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:14,583
Hey.

1204
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:16,916
Everything's okay. What's going on?

1205
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,708
- We won! We won!
- We won?

1206
01:31:18,791 --> 01:31:20,416
Blaire, stop. You don't gotta do this.

1207
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,666
- I'll tell you when you can talk!
- I don't work for you anymore.

1208
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:26,500
So I'm not gonna listen
to any more of your crazy bullshit.

1209
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:29,250
You're gonna let him
talk to us like that, Blaire?

1210
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,375
I can't do this.

1211
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:35,416
No, no, no, no!
Everything is finally good.

1212
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:38,916
- We're finally good.
- I'm telling you, I'm done.

1213
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,791
Hey! I need you.

1214
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:46,166
I can't do this without you.
I don't want to do this without you.

1215
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:48,500
- I want out. Oh!
- No, Blaire, no!

1216
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:50,125
You were nothing!

1217
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:53,041
I made you! I made you!

1218
01:31:53,125 --> 01:31:54,791
You can't leave me.

1219
01:31:55,291 --> 01:31:57,000
- You need me.
- Not anymore.

1220
01:31:58,083 --> 01:31:59,208
- No!
- No!

1221
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:07,375
- Look at what you did, Benny.
- No!

1222
01:32:07,458 --> 01:32:09,000
Look at what you did.

1223
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,333
She's had a weak heart.
Put her out of her misery.

1224
01:32:15,416 --> 01:32:17,375
This was supposed to be our night.

1225
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:19,125
No.

1226
01:32:20,875 --> 01:32:21,958
Night's over.

1227
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:35,500
Benny.

1228
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:38,250
Jay?

1229
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:39,916
- Hey. Jay.
- Run.

1230
01:33:40,458 --> 01:33:43,208
- Jay. Where is he? Where is he?
- Run. Run. Now.

1231
01:33:43,291 --> 01:33:45,708
It's a trap. Benny...

1232
01:34:52,041 --> 01:34:54,916
Benny, you're okay. No, Benny. Benny.

1233
01:34:55,541 --> 01:34:59,291
Hey. No. You're okay. You're okay.

1234
01:35:04,416 --> 01:35:05,583
It's okay.

1235
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,125
Here.

1236
01:37:17,708 --> 01:37:20,458
- I, uh, spoke to the depot.
- Right.

1237
01:37:20,541 --> 01:37:22,958
"Jay, you can never ever drive
for the company again."

1238
01:37:23,458 --> 01:37:26,791
- I told you not to scratch it, fool.
- I did a little more than a scratch it.

1239
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:29,458
Yeah, you did, man. Yeah, you did.

1240
01:37:29,541 --> 01:37:31,291
But, um, I wouldn't be here

1241
01:37:31,375 --> 01:37:34,041
eating this fine slice of pizza
if it weren't for you.

1242
01:37:35,333 --> 01:37:37,041
Well, you'd do the same for me so…

1243
01:37:41,083 --> 01:37:43,083
Things are gonna be different, you know.

1244
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:45,208
The whole world's changed.

1245
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:48,166
And everyone's gonna have to take a side.

1246
01:37:51,625 --> 01:37:54,666
Just don't forget where you came from.

1247
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:57,458
I know where home is.

1248
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:09,208
Oh, I, uh, left you a little something.

1249
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:06,750
Come on. Ask him what happened.

1250
01:39:06,833 --> 01:39:07,666
Yo.

1251
01:39:08,291 --> 01:39:09,333
Benny, man. Hold up.

1252
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,833
What's up?

1253
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:14,500
Where you been, man?

1254
01:39:15,166 --> 01:39:17,250
We see you at the club,
and then you went MIA.

1255
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:18,958
Yeah. Um, Benny.

1256
01:39:22,625 --> 01:39:23,458
Are you okay?

1257
01:39:28,083 --> 01:39:29,208
Never been better.

1258
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Hey.

1259
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:35,083
Get in. We're running late.

1260
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:42,958
Yeah, I gotta go,
but I'll see y'all later, yeah?

1261
01:39:43,916 --> 01:39:44,958
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1262
01:39:56,625 --> 01:39:57,625
Y'all want a ride?
