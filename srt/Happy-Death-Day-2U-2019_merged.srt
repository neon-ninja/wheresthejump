in a dorm room again?

1393
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:16,042
Only if it's yours.

1394
01:28:18,044 --> 01:28:20,087
I mean, of course you'll have to,
sleep in Ryan's bed.

1395
01:28:20,171 --> 01:28:22,256
- Of course.
- Yeah.

1396
01:28:23,132 --> 01:28:24,675
We can...
Yeah.

1397
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:26,552
(LAUGHS)

1398
01:28:26,636 --> 01:28:27,637
Oh! Uh...

1399
01:28:28,554 --> 01:28:31,057
Almost forgot.

1400
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:32,558
You left this little guy.

1401
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:38,397
Thanks.

1402
01:28:39,398 --> 01:28:41,567
You know,
what your little scenario reminds me of?

1403
01:28:41,651 --> 01:28:42,777
What?

1404
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:43,945
What's that?

1405
01:28:44,028 --> 01:28:46,489
<i>Groundhog Day.</i>
The movie, <i>Groundhog Day?</i>

1406
01:28:46,572 --> 01:28:47,740
I don't know.

1407
01:28:47,824 --> 01:28:48,950
With Bill Murray?

1408
01:28:49,033 --> 01:28:50,618
Who's Bill Murray?

1409
01:28:50,701 --> 01:28:52,995
Are you kidding me?
<i>Ghostbusters.</i>

1410
01:28:53,079 --> 01:28:54,622
Sorry.
I...

1411
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:56,582
- How...
- I don't know.

1412
01:28:56,707 --> 01:28:58,988
How do you sleep at night?
You've never seen <i>Groundhog Day?</i>

1413
01:28:59,043 --> 01:29:00,044
TREE: <i>No.</i>

I wasn't sure if you uh, wanted to, uh,
you know, sleep in or not.

1420

I'm kidding.
It was... It was me.

1421
01:29:24,277 --> 01:29:25,862
I just called your phone.

1422
01:29:25,945 --> 01:29:27,071
What?

1423
01:29:27,697 --> 01:29:30,032
It's Tuesday, the 19th.
You made it.

1424
01:29:31,284 --> 01:29:35,538
Oh, my God.
You are such a jerk!

1425
01:29:35,621 --> 01:29:37,540
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Hey, that's enough.

1426
01:29:37,623 --> 01:29:39,959
What is wrong with you?

1427
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:44,422
That was not funny.
You are such a punk.

- (SIGHS) She's back?
- Out.

1430
01:29:53,973 --> 01:29:55,200
I'm not sleeping in my car again.

1431
01:29:55,224 --> 01:29:56,410
It smells like Hot Pockets and feet.

1432
01:29:56,434 --> 01:29:58,269
- Get out.
- I just want clean underwear.

1433
