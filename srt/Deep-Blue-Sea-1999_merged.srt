1
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,003
So beautiful.

2
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,631
What's that?

3
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:33,761
-Did you feel something?
-Yeah, I feel something.

4
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:38,724
Hey, get back here!

5
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:43,437
Turn up the music!

6
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,192
We're having a party, man.

7
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:53,155
You guys are having fun. Boat's rocking.

8
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:58,952
Stop!

9
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,831
-You're paranoid!
-Listen.

10
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,423
Did you hear that?

11
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,634
Listen, listen.

12
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:28,356
-You hear that?
-What is that?

13
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,949
Everybody, shh!

14
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,744
Stay up there.

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What is that?

16
00:03:19,656 --> 00:03:22,492
Come on!

17
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:24,636
Okay, we've had some problems
at the facility.

18
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:28,015
What we're attempting to achieve
has never been done.

19
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:32,269
We're this close to the reactivation
of a human brain cell.

20
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,437
Doctor...

21
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:37,733
...the $200 million I sunk into this company
is due in great part to your research.

22
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,776
But when the market opens Monday...

23
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:42,779
...despite my reputation,
I don't like heights.

24
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:45,824
Especially falling from them.

25
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:49,452
I'm sorry, honestly.

26
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,759
Tell me, Mr. Franklin, have you ever known
anyone with Alzheimer's?

27
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,304
Well, no.

28
00:05:08,554 --> 00:05:13,142
By the end, all my father could do
was ask why my mother wasn't at home.

29
00:05:13,392 --> 00:05:17,688
Each time I said she was dead,
I saw him take the loss like a car wreck.

30
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:22,818
200,000 men and women
develop Alzheimer's each year.

31
00:05:22,943 --> 00:05:27,823
What if you could end all that suffering
with a single pill?

32
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,744
Give me till Monday morning. 48 hours.

33
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:34,580
I'll give you results
that'll skyrocket your stock price...

34
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,040
...or I'll help you pack the lab myself.

35
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:40,461
It's your call.

36
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:58,645
That was an impressive speech
you gave back there.

37
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:01,523
I read that article on you.

38
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:04,693
-The thing in the Himalayas.
-Alps.

39
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:07,362
Right.

40
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:11,783
We were just trying
to do something together.

41
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:14,160
Having fun.

42
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,955
Things went bad.

43
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:19,082
But you saved all those people.

44
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:22,168
Not all.

45
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,268
Navy built it for WWII submarine loading...

46
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:41,395
...refueling.

47
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:47,359
When they mothballed it, we picked it up,
added aquatic pens, underwater labs.

48
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:50,946
Your dime, I guess.

49
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:55,826
Looks like Alcatraz floats.

50
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:30,360
What do you think? She's a 12-footer.
She's beautiful.

51
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,779
-She wants to give you a big kiss.
-I bet.

52
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:35,239
She's got a license plate
jammed in her mouth.

53
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,825
It's a good deal, "amigo".

54
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:41,078
Drop her, Billy!

55
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,926
Russell Franklin, Janice Higgins.

56
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:57,720
Marine biologist.

57
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,557
Jan will get you settled.

58
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,059
Welcome to our island paradise.

59
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:05,769
Where's Tattoo?

60
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,689
You know, short guy?

61
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:11,608
"The plane, Boss! The plane!"

62
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:14,069
Right.

63
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,738
I am getting old.

64
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:18,865
How much do you know about our facility?

65
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:20,450
Treat me like a tourist.

66
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,330
I hate tourists and I've decided
I'm going to like you.

67
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,699
"Louisiana."

68
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,619
I think he was bought in a pet shop
in Baton Rouge.

69
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:51,247
Ate everything in his tank,
and then ate the guy that bought him.

70
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:56,544
Next day, fills up the cab of the guy's truck
with water and drives to Baja...

71
00:09:56,794 --> 00:10:01,507
...picking bones out of his teeth
with the license plate.

72
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:04,927
We need to talk.

73
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,555
Later.

74
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:14,020
Carter Blake, Russell Franklin,
president of Chimera Pharmaceuticals.

75
00:10:14,395 --> 00:10:17,273
That was incredible.

76
00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:21,944
Actually, they don't like the taste
of us very much.

77
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:29,243
If they bite you, it's because
they think you're a fat little seal.

78
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:32,663
Or a rich suit.

79
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:39,711
Nice meeting you.

80
00:10:41,713 --> 00:10:43,006
Friendly place.

81
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:48,011
You got full sentences.
Usually, he just kind of nods.

82
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:52,933
Word travels fast
about why you're here and all.

83
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:54,809
Was that the Gen 1 that escaped?

84
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,772
That little guy? No way.
Those are the normals.

85
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:02,484
These three are the test sharks.

86
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:09,824
Two first-generation
and one second-generation female.

87
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:17,582
Beneath its glassy surface...

88
00:11:17,832 --> 00:11:21,461
...a world of gliding monsters.

89
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,383
It's pretty scary stuff, huh?

90
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:30,678
Yes. It is.

91
00:11:30,928 --> 00:11:34,181
Tower to water taxi.

92
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:37,935
Ben, I'm picking up a nasty little bitch
of a squall about 30 miles out.

93
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:39,019
Over.

94
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,731
Copy that. We'll be all right.

95
00:11:48,695 --> 00:11:51,115
Jan, stay out of the rain.

96
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:53,534
Where are they going? They hate me too?

97
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:58,038
They're going home.
We run a skeleton crew on the weekend.

98
00:11:58,288 --> 00:12:01,541
But they probably hate you anyway.

99
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:06,296
There's Dr. Jim Whitlock,
the most brilliant man ever.

100
00:12:06,546 --> 00:12:09,716
He's pissing into the wind.
How brilliant can he be?

101
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:12,969
You'll see.

102
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:27,442
What happened, deadeye?
You miss with the first shot?

103
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:29,485
It took two hits to even slow it down.

104
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:32,530
Are you kidding?
Two of these should've almost killed it.

105
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,031
Go tell it that, Scoggs.

106
00:12:34,282 --> 00:12:37,910
You missed. Don't get mad at me
because you can't shoot worth a shit.

107
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,205
If you hadn't left the pen open,
I could've had a good sleep.

108
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:44,333
I already told the doc,
I locked the pen like I do every night.

109
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,461
The fish got out some other way.

110
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:50,339
What are you looking at me like that for?

111
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:52,174
Who are you going to trust?

112
00:12:52,424 --> 00:12:55,135
Me, that's who. You trust me.

113
00:12:55,386 --> 00:13:00,015
You know why? Because I'm trustworthy.

114
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:08,190
How high are these fences off the water?

115
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:12,235
Given the surface variations
and tensile strength--

116
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:14,821
Short answer, man.

117
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:19,117
Eight feet, give or take a centimeter.

118
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:27,709
I'm sorry. I'm making Aquatica sound
like a mental hospital.

119
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,336
No, not really.

120
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:31,671
Well, maybe a little.

121
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:34,799
The truth is, it is.

122
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:37,886
But almost everyone here is top
of their game.

123
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:42,849
Living below is like living in space.
You don't get very many mistakes.

124
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:44,642
Besides the catwalks...

125
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:49,063
...you bought us titanium-based fencing
around all the lagoon and pens.

126
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:52,233
There are three sub-levels.
Sub-level One is living quarters.

127
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,485
Two: Wet lab and workshops.

128
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:59,448
And Three: Engineering
and air-locked wet entry.

129
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,623
Welcome to Aquatica.

130
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,533
Did you dose the Gen 2 with the serum?

131
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:48,288
I had Carter do it as soon as you called.
It should be ready tomorrow night.

132
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:51,541
-But?
-We will not be ready.

133
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,585
Two months ahead of schedule.

134
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:56,879
We're skipping three rounds
of preliminary trials.

135
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,049
No choice.

136
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:06,806
You wait your whole life
for a single moment...

137
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:11,060
...and then one day, it's tomorrow.

138
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:22,154
So what exactly does a shark wrangler do?

139
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:25,157
Pretty much what it sounds like, I guess.

140
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:27,660
How'd you end up here at Aquatica?

141
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,411
I like the water.

142
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:32,623
Pay is good.

143
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:41,423
An AGA mask! Did some wreck diving
in one of these, off the coast of Spain.

144
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,342
Tourist thing.

145
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:48,513
Do you like wreck diving?

146
00:15:49,764 --> 00:15:51,433
It's okay.

147
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:55,061
I bet you're really good at it.

148
00:15:55,312 --> 00:16:01,359
We're on the water.
Whole cat-and-mouse thing don't float.

149
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:06,072
You're the man, right?

150
00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:10,159
Yeah, I'm the man.

151
00:16:10,243 --> 00:16:13,121
The man's always got a file. What's it say?

152
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:17,667
Two years, Leavenworth. Smuggling.

153
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:20,253
How'd you make your money?

154
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:24,215
You the first rich guy in history
who's squeaky-clean?

155
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:27,802
You do understand my concern, right?

156
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:31,013
Look, I got a workable deal here.

157
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:32,723
I don't make waves.

158
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:35,392
I meet the terms of my parole.

159
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:39,104
I'm not out to change the world,
like the doc.

160
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:43,192
I'm not out to wreck it either.

161
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:55,829
Eat me, asshole!

162
00:16:57,372 --> 00:17:00,709
Hey, you dickhead!

163
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:06,506
Fat butt!

164
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:08,967
You got a big, fat butt.

165
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:10,385
You know what, bird?

166
00:17:10,635 --> 00:17:13,930
You're trying my last nerve.
Don't make me drown your feathery ass.

167
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,807
Get myself a cat.

168
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:20,562
That's good. Yes. That's good.

169
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:23,439
That's it.

170
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,944
You got a nasty-looking tongue,
you know that?

171
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:35,409
Feeding time.

172
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,795
I'm releasing the tiger shark
in 30 seconds. Copy?

173
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:49,673
I hear you. I'm going in.

174
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:53,636
You guys hungry?

175
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:33,716
Dr. McAlester, we have a situation up here.

176
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:37,720
Could you please come to surface level?

177
00:18:37,971 --> 00:18:43,393
Dr. McAlester, could you come
to surf ace level, please?

178
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

179
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:24,808
Surprise!

180
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:28,895
Happy birthday!

181
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:34,943
Damn, I hate that song.

182
00:19:35,193 --> 00:19:39,280
You like the tunes there, Preach?

183
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:46,079
Carter, join us. There's too much woman
on this deck for Scoggs to handle.

184
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:48,665
Vodka, straight.

185
00:19:48,915 --> 00:19:54,587
And by the way,
food was excellent, brother.

186
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:59,050
You're that guy that got caught
in that avalanche, right?

187
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,218
I'm the one.

188
00:20:00,468 --> 00:20:02,386
Black men have enough ways
to get killed...

189
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:06,015
...without climbing up some mountain
in the middle of nowhere.

190
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:11,020
You need to leave that
to the white folks, "brother."

191
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:19,028
Happy birthday?

192
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:22,781
I'll let you know tomorrow.

193
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:24,616
How's life underwater?

194
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:28,412
It's a lot less complicated...

195
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,956
...than it is on the surface.

196
00:20:31,206 --> 00:20:33,584
That's for sure.

197
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:36,295
Nice work with that new tiger shark today.

198
00:20:36,545 --> 00:20:39,089
One day, you'll have to tell me
how you learned that.

199
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:43,552
One day, you'll take me up
on that beer and maybe I will.

200
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:46,388
It's all work for me, Carter.

201
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:49,516
But, like you said, "One day."

202
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:55,063
Sharks never get cancer, go blind
or show loss of brain activity as they age.

203
00:20:55,313 --> 00:20:57,857
Unlike some people I know.

204
00:20:58,108 --> 00:21:01,027
Sharks are the oldest creatures
on the planet...

205
00:21:01,277 --> 00:21:07,075
...from a time when the world
was just flesh and teeth.

206
00:21:07,325 --> 00:21:08,743
By using a hormonal enhancer...

207
00:21:08,993 --> 00:21:12,997
...we increased this female's forebrain
to five times its normal size.

208
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:14,665
To harvest more protein.

209
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,168
Exactly. A protein that may reactivate--

210
00:21:17,418 --> 00:21:18,794
That will....

211
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:23,841
...that will reactivate human brain cells
stored in the forebrain of the shark.

212
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:28,929
I'm just amazed that we've come so far,
so fast, without genetic tampering.

213
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,809
Genetic engineering to increase brain mass
violates the Harvard Genetics Compact.

214
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:38,230
Not to mention Chimera policy.

215
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:41,108
They're hunting in packs.

216
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:44,736
Like wild dogs.

217
00:21:44,862 --> 00:21:47,197
They'll only eat other sharks.

218
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:50,409
You're reading too much into it.

219
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:55,038
That Gen 1 attacked a 25-foot boat.

220
00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:59,584
Am I reading too much into that too?

221
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:03,296
Did you tell Franklin?

222
00:22:03,463 --> 00:22:05,590
I'm just a fish keeper, lady.

223
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,179
But bringing in that shark
ahead of schedule was a very bad idea.

224
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,184
Do you like your job?

225
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:21,105
Are you threatening me, Doc?

226
00:22:21,356 --> 00:22:23,524
No.

227
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:29,489
But if we don't pull off that test tomorrow,
we're all on the street.

228
00:22:30,323 --> 00:22:33,618
You're a good man, Carter.

229
00:22:33,868 --> 00:22:37,413
But with your background....

230
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:44,795
Right.

231
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:05,148
How's Miss Smarty-Pants?

232
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:08,443
Hope she's not as dumb as she seems.

233
00:23:08,694 --> 00:23:11,071
Raise those fences like I asked?

234
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:15,867
I took care of it. Let's go get a beer.

235
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,668
US Coast Guard advisories include:

236
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,590
All-craft warnings for waters south
of the US mainland and west of CA.

237
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,676
A tropical depression is generating
gale-force winds...

238
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:39,474
...and is associated with heavy rains
and ocean swells to 30 feet or more.

239
00:23:46,355 --> 00:23:50,484
Any of your nonsense, and we'll have
tiny drumsticks on the menu tonight.

240
00:23:50,735 --> 00:23:53,237
Fat butt!

241
00:23:53,487 --> 00:23:54,155
That's right.

242
00:23:54,405 --> 00:23:57,992
You can...all you want.

243
00:24:46,456 --> 00:24:50,501
Welcome to my parlor, Mr. Franklin.

244
00:24:55,673 --> 00:24:58,259
Wow.

245
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:03,264
Wet lab, we're taking a pounding up here.
Can't see past my nose.

246
00:25:03,514 --> 00:25:06,434
So I suggest you check pen monitors
and lagoon monitors.

247
00:25:06,684 --> 00:25:08,728
I can't imagine
there's much visibility below.

248
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:12,148
Carter, you copy?

249
00:25:14,441 --> 00:25:17,069
Okay, I'm approaching the tunnel.

250
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:19,822
Bingo. Elvis has left the building.

251
00:25:20,072 --> 00:25:22,950
We picked you up,
but visibility's near zero.

252
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,411
No problem.

253
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

254
00:26:08,578 --> 00:26:12,957
How long have they been synchronized
like this?

255
00:26:18,004 --> 00:26:21,590
Tell me I didn't see that.

256
00:26:23,926 --> 00:26:25,344
They recognized that gun!

257
00:26:25,594 --> 00:26:28,722
That's impossible.
Sharks can't swim backwards!

258
00:26:28,973 --> 00:26:32,601
-Try to stay focused.
-What was that?

259
00:26:36,814 --> 00:26:39,108
We lost picture in Gen 2 pen.

260
00:26:39,358 --> 00:26:42,528
Okay, hold on.

261
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:23,234
Carter, do you copy?

262
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:28,156
Carter, do you copy?

263
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:40,626
Carter, talk to me, man. Do you copy?

264
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,467
Cut the crap! You're scaring everybody.

265
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,995
Boarding platform engaged. He's got her.

266
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,637
Did someone order the fish?

267
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:04,708
What in God's creation?

268
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:08,003
No, not His.

269
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:11,215
Ours.

270
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:25,020
Commencing scan.

271
00:29:26,313 --> 00:29:29,983
Gen 2 is online.
Transferring exotics to remote terminals.

272
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:32,277
Vital signs to Terminal 1.

273
00:29:32,527 --> 00:29:36,656
Diagnostic imaging to Terminal 2.

274
00:29:51,421 --> 00:29:53,047
We're live and in color!

275
00:29:53,297 --> 00:29:55,299
BP, 67 over 43.

276
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,260
Heart rate, 50 BPM.

277
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,346
Within norm.

278
00:30:07,937 --> 00:30:11,440
She's sleeping like a baby.

279
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

280
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:39,801
Bad dream?

281
00:30:58,361 --> 00:30:59,862
In position.

282
00:31:00,113 --> 00:31:03,366
Vitals are stable.

283
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,987
Vitals?

284
00:31:42,237 --> 00:31:42,863
Holding.

285
00:31:43,113 --> 00:31:47,492
Aspirating 4.5 cc.

286
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:26,572
Introducing 2 cc of the protein complex...

287
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:32,662
...into cultured, inactive brain neurons
of an Alzheimer's patient.

288
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:43,881
And what you're looking for here
is lightning in a bottle.

289
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:53,474
Protein complex is interacting
with the neurons.

290
00:32:57,811 --> 00:33:01,732
Neurons are becoming hyperosmotic.

291
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:08,446
Membrane integrity's improving.

292
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,034
They're firing!

293
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:14,869
-They're firing!
-One second.

294
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,329
Two. Three.

295
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:19,833
-Still firing.
-Four. Five. Six.

296
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:23,002
6.560 seconds.

297
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:24,587
I'll be damned.

298
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:27,507
No, sir. For 6.560 seconds...

299
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:31,678
...you saw what it's like not to be damned.

300
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:34,889
Congratulations.

301
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:40,061
-Impressed?
-Overly impressed.

302
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:43,564
6.560 seconds.

303
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:45,149
Now that you've got this...

304
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
...how long before you make
something permanent?
You did it, pal.
You did it.

305
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:03,459
No!

306
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:27,065
Carter, no!

307
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,291
Are you insane?

308
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,216
Tower, we need paramedics and evac now!

309
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,134
All frequencies, SOS.

310
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:59,764
This is Research Station Aquatica.
We have a medical emergency. I repeat:

311
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:04,018
This is Research Station Aquatica.
We have a medical emergency.

312
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,229
Please respond.

313
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,236
X-ray Alpha 2-18.

314
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:18,115
Coming off oil platform Chiapa.

315
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,452
We'll take that post you've always wanted.

316
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,496
Got it.

317
00:35:25,497 --> 00:35:26,748
He's hemorrhaging!

318
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:31,962
They say the yellow butterflies are thick
as clouds there, remember?

319
00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:36,174
Research Station Aquatica,
this is X-ray Alpha 2-18.

320
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:39,761
Have you in sight. Approaching from 0-6-0.

321
00:35:40,011 --> 00:35:41,513
Copy, 2-18.

322
00:35:41,763 --> 00:35:45,266
Stay with him. Keep talking.

323
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:49,604
Let's move!

324
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:57,487
-I'm not this kind of doctor.
-Just keep doing what you're doing.

325
00:36:05,661 --> 00:36:08,122
Where's the chopper? Tower?

326
00:36:08,372 --> 00:36:12,209
Come on, Brenda. Where's my chopper?

327
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:25,889
Franklin, this end!

328
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,908
Keep it coming!

329
00:36:44,908 --> 00:36:49,079
Ready. It's all right, honey. Hold on.

330
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:53,124
Got it. Okay, move him out.

331
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:56,253
Let's go!

332
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:11,267
I love you!

333
00:37:28,701 --> 00:37:32,037
-Come on!
-Get up! Come on!

334
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:44,258
Come on, Carter!

335
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:31,095
Pull up, 2-18! Pull up!

336
00:38:48,112 --> 00:38:49,905
Damn! I can't get a picture.

337
00:38:50,156 --> 00:38:52,449
Tower, have you got a visual? Copy.

338
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,536
I can't get anything.

339
00:38:58,747 --> 00:39:00,165
-Do you copy?
-Going to back-up.

340
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:03,043
Got it!

341
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:13,612
I'm going to take this as a sign.

342
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,707
Where is he now?

343
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:28,627
Where is he?

344
00:40:28,877 --> 00:40:32,839
-The whole system's shut down.
-Brenda?

345
00:40:33,089 --> 00:40:34,049
Are you there?

346
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:37,344
This thing is dead.

347
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,763
Somebody, please...

348
00:40:40,013 --> 00:40:41,931
...tell me what that is.

349
00:40:42,182 --> 00:40:44,976
Please.

350
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:30,896
All right, people, let's move.

351
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:33,148
Now!

352
00:41:33,398 --> 00:41:35,317
Get to the door!

353
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:39,237
Come on. You can't help him.

354
00:42:23,656 --> 00:42:27,034
-The door frame is bent.
-Open.

355
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,791
Open it!

356
00:42:54,811 --> 00:42:56,897
Turn it! Turn it!

357
00:42:57,147 --> 00:42:59,983
No!

358
00:43:07,782 --> 00:43:11,119
Tower, can you hear me?

359
00:43:11,494 --> 00:43:14,664
Anyone, hello?

360
00:43:25,675 --> 00:43:28,302
We got to get topside, find some help.

361
00:43:28,553 --> 00:43:29,345
What?

362
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:31,389
We're flooded.

363
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:34,267
Shit!

364
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:37,895
There's no other stairway from this level.

365
00:43:38,145 --> 00:43:39,146
Elevator?

366
00:43:39,397 --> 00:43:43,192
It seals off automatically
to keep the shaft from filling.

367
00:43:43,442 --> 00:43:46,487
There's no way up.

368
00:44:15,265 --> 00:44:17,976
All right. Okay.

369
00:44:18,226 --> 00:44:22,314
If this is a lesson about the drinking,
let's just say I've learned it.

370
00:44:22,564 --> 00:44:25,692
No need to get carried away,
showing me your vengeful side.

371
00:44:25,942 --> 00:44:28,361
I know Your wrath, Lord.

372
00:44:28,611 --> 00:44:30,029
If Corridor B is dry...

373
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,576
...we go back to the maintenance ladder,
climb down to Level 3.

374
00:44:34,826 --> 00:44:36,160
We get to the wet entry.

375
00:44:36,411 --> 00:44:41,833
We take the sub topside, two at a time.
We go down to get up.

376
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:46,295
All right, let's move. Come on.

377
00:45:44,394 --> 00:45:45,728
Sounds like somebody made it.

378
00:45:45,979 --> 00:45:50,066
Over here! We're over here!

379
00:45:53,778 --> 00:45:56,739
Preach?

380
00:46:01,702 --> 00:46:02,828
What the hell is that?

381
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:04,830
Lab equipment maybe, banging around.

382
00:46:05,081 --> 00:46:06,082
Think so?

383
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:09,251
Not a chance.

384
00:46:11,128 --> 00:46:13,255
We got to get past that door.

385
00:46:13,506 --> 00:46:16,926
Let's go!

386
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:28,353
Come on!

387
00:46:35,527 --> 00:46:36,737
Open the door!

388
00:46:36,987 --> 00:46:39,573
Go! Go!

389
00:47:10,853 --> 00:47:13,773
Bird!

390
00:47:14,315 --> 00:47:15,775
Come on, bird!

391
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:19,403
Where are you, bird?

392
00:47:23,783 --> 00:47:27,036
Hey, dickhead!

393
00:47:27,328 --> 00:47:29,955
Bird?

394
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,540
Fat butt!

395
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:34,585
Bird?

396
00:47:38,964 --> 00:47:42,426
Anybody here?

397
00:47:43,635 --> 00:47:46,346
-Cowboy, let me ask you a question.
-We should keep moving.

398
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:49,766
I'm talking to him!

399
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:54,688
Was that a goddamn shark
that broke through that door?

400
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:55,731
I expect so.

401
00:47:55,981 --> 00:47:58,692
You expect so?

402
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,152
Well, well, well.

403
00:48:00,402 --> 00:48:05,657
Am I the only asshole down here
who thinks that a tad bit odd?

404
00:48:05,657 --> 00:48:09,828
It can do that? Bust through a steel door?

405
00:48:10,078 --> 00:48:12,413
I ain't the expert.

406
00:48:12,664 --> 00:48:15,166
Given Gen 2's size
and some room to move...

407
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:20,129
...she could put a couple tons,
maybe more, into a hit.

408
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,507
So, yeah, in my opinion.

409
00:48:22,757 --> 00:48:25,468
If she wants through, she's coming.

410
00:48:25,718 --> 00:48:27,637
And these sharks...

411
00:48:27,887 --> 00:48:31,390
...they aren't breaking down doors
for the sheer joy of it, are they?

412
00:48:31,641 --> 00:48:34,852
They're after us.

413
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:39,273
It's obvious we don't know
what they're doing.

414
00:48:42,651 --> 00:48:47,156
What the hell did you do to those sharks?

415
00:48:48,574 --> 00:48:54,163
Their brains weren't large enough to
harvest sufficient amounts of the protein.

416
00:48:54,413 --> 00:48:58,584
So we violated the Harvard Compact.

417
00:49:00,002 --> 00:49:02,879
Jim and I used gene therapies
to increase their brain mass.

418
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:06,216
Larger brain means more protein.

419
00:49:06,466 --> 00:49:10,887
As a side effect, the sharks got smarter.

420
00:49:12,806 --> 00:49:16,643
You stupid bitch!

421
00:49:23,108 --> 00:49:26,402
I didn't want this to happen...

422
00:49:26,653 --> 00:49:31,574
...but with this research, we could
wipe out degenerative brain disease.

423
00:49:31,824 --> 00:49:34,577
Think of the generations
that would be saved.

424
00:49:34,827 --> 00:49:41,209
How much dynamite do you have to set off
in your ears before your head clears?

425
00:49:41,334 --> 00:49:43,878
You wouldn't understand.

426
00:49:44,128 --> 00:49:46,589
I wouldn't?

427
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:52,470
Dumb old Carter wouldn't understand
that you used us?

428
00:49:53,387 --> 00:49:56,682
That you used me?

429
00:49:56,849 --> 00:49:59,894
Someone on the water
who wouldn't make waves.

430
00:50:00,144 --> 00:50:02,771
Someone who wouldn't ask
too many questions.

431
00:50:03,022 --> 00:50:04,523
Because he had something to lose.

432
00:50:04,773 --> 00:50:06,358
You don't see what we've done here.

433
00:50:06,608 --> 00:50:09,987
You've taken God's oldest killing machine
and given it will and desire.

434
00:50:10,237 --> 00:50:14,616
You've knocked us to the bottom
of the goddamn food chain.

435
00:50:14,867 --> 00:50:19,037
It's not a great leap forward, in my book.

436
00:50:20,288 --> 00:50:21,623
The people we'll save....

437
00:50:21,873 --> 00:50:25,460
Jim? Brenda?

438
00:50:25,794 --> 00:50:28,505
Us?

439
00:50:29,172 --> 00:50:30,840
All right, people.

440
00:50:31,091 --> 00:50:35,303
These sharks are thinking hard and clear.

441
00:50:35,553 --> 00:50:37,680
So here's the riddle.

442
00:50:37,931 --> 00:50:39,974
What does an 8,000-pound mako shark...

443
00:50:40,225 --> 00:50:46,064
...with a brain the size of a V8 engine
and no natural predators, think about?

444
00:50:46,147 --> 00:50:49,233
I'm not waiting around here to find out.

445
00:50:49,484 --> 00:50:51,277
Now you see how that works?

446
00:50:51,527 --> 00:50:56,866
She screwed with the sharks
and now the sharks are screwing with us.

447
00:51:14,508 --> 00:51:18,012
Please let me get out of here.

448
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,411
What if the sharks get through the fence
and into the ocean?

449
00:52:25,661 --> 00:52:28,497
It's okay. The fence
on the ocean side is titanium.

450
00:52:28,747 --> 00:52:31,000
And it gives, so it works just like a net.

451
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:36,296
Let's get to the sub.
We'll discuss it on the way to the top.

452
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

453
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,869
Eat me, asshole.

454
00:53:53,956 --> 00:53:55,707
Careful, now.

455
00:53:55,958 --> 00:53:59,211
Come on, bird. Come on.

456
00:53:59,461 --> 00:54:00,504
Please, baby.

457
00:54:00,754 --> 00:54:01,463
Dickhead.

458
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
See Daddy smiling?
Come on.
Bring your feathery ass here. Come on.

459
00:54:43,296 --> 00:54:45,715
-Explosion caused that?
-No.

460
00:54:45,965 --> 00:54:51,637
Nothing in here could've blown
with enough force to move that damn sub.

461
00:54:51,887 --> 00:54:54,181
Whatever. It's junk.

462
00:54:54,431 --> 00:55:00,229
We could all just dive in
and see who makes it to the top.

463
00:55:02,189 --> 00:55:05,609
Isn't that the old Aquatica spirit, Dr. Susie?

464
00:55:05,859 --> 00:55:09,571
Just dive in.

465
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:12,908
You could go first, to lead by example.

466
00:55:13,158 --> 00:55:14,701
He was my best friend, Janice.

467
00:55:14,952 --> 00:55:16,119
I'm not going in the water.

468
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:19,289
-No way, man! The sharks are in there.
-Listen!

469
00:55:19,539 --> 00:55:23,710
We put these on. They help
fight hypothermia. That's a start.

470
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,588
And unless someone's got a better idea...

471
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:30,300
...we're going to have to swim out of here.

472
00:55:48,484 --> 00:55:52,530
This isn't happening.

473
00:56:15,219 --> 00:56:19,348
I'm not Daniel when he faced the lion!

474
00:56:23,644 --> 00:56:26,313
So I appreciate the irony, Lord!

475
00:56:26,563 --> 00:56:30,067
"Cook dies in his own oven!"

476
00:56:30,442 --> 00:56:34,780
But I've got other plans!

477
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,610
You ate my bird.

478
00:57:25,496 --> 00:57:26,539
Was that the surface?

479
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:31,168
No, the vibrations are too deep.
That was from inside.

480
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:41,678
I wouldn't get that close.

481
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:43,805
Just a suggestion.

482
00:57:44,056 --> 00:57:46,725
Water's murky. We might make it.

483
00:57:46,975 --> 00:57:50,896
No way! No, we won't!

484
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:53,690
It's 230 feet...

485
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:57,611
...from the lagoon floor
to the lagoon surface!

486
00:57:57,861 --> 00:58:00,572
The average human swims
two feet per second.

487
00:58:00,822 --> 00:58:03,867
The average shark swims
50 feet per second.

488
00:58:04,117 --> 00:58:07,287
There's no way I'm getting into that pool!

489
00:58:07,537 --> 00:58:10,582
What we have here is
your basic maintenance ladder.

490
00:58:10,832 --> 00:58:12,625
This leads up to the surface.

491
00:58:12,875 --> 00:58:15,920
I love you, Scoggs. I really do!

492
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:19,215
Why do I feel a "but" coming on?

493
00:58:19,257 --> 00:58:22,135
But we don't know what shape
the surface level is in.

494
00:58:22,385 --> 00:58:23,803
The shaft is air-locked.

495
00:58:24,053 --> 00:58:27,139
But if the explosion breached the shaft
at surface level...

496
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:29,976
...we won't have enough pressure
to stabilize the wet pool.

497
00:58:30,226 --> 00:58:34,647
If the pool isn't stabilized,
there's tons of ocean dying to get in.

498
00:58:34,897 --> 00:58:36,941
You'll bring the whole facility down.

499
00:58:37,191 --> 00:58:39,026
We're better off with the sharks.

500
00:58:39,276 --> 00:58:41,612
You want to swim with your fishes?
Go ahead!

501
00:58:41,862 --> 00:58:44,198
I'm opening this door
and climbing out of here!

502
00:58:44,448 --> 00:58:47,117
-The hell you are!
-I don't work for you anymore!

503
00:58:47,368 --> 00:58:49,328
-I don't have to take orders!
-Enough!

504
00:58:49,578 --> 00:58:53,749
That's enough now, from all of you!

505
00:58:56,293 --> 00:58:58,211
You think water's fast?

506
00:58:58,462 --> 00:59:02,966
You should see ice.
It moves like it has a mind.

507
00:59:03,216 --> 00:59:08,763
Like it knows it killed the world once.
It got a taste for murder.

508
00:59:08,805 --> 00:59:10,765
When the avalanche came...

509
00:59:11,016 --> 00:59:14,185
...it took us a week to climb out.

510
00:59:14,436 --> 00:59:19,065
And somewhere we lost hope.

511
00:59:19,399 --> 00:59:23,528
I don't know when we turned
on each other.

512
00:59:23,778 --> 00:59:25,363
I just know...

513
00:59:25,613 --> 00:59:29,200
...that seven of us survived the slide...

514
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:33,246
...and only five made it out.

515
00:59:34,163 --> 00:59:38,042
Now, we took an oath
that I'm breaking now.

516
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:42,171
Swore that we'd say it was the snow
that killed the other two.

517
00:59:42,421 --> 00:59:44,548
But it wasn't.

518
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:47,676
Nature can be lethal.

519
00:59:47,927 --> 00:59:52,139
But it doesn't hold a candle to man.

520
00:59:53,265 --> 00:59:57,978
You've seen how bad things can get
and how quick they can get that way.

521
00:59:58,228 --> 01:00:00,647
Well, they can get a whole lot worse.

522
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:05,277
So we're not going to fight anymore!

523
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
We're going to pull together
and find a way to get out of here!
First, we're going to seal off this pool!

524
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,928
Oh, my God.

525
01:00:41,312 --> 01:00:43,564
It just ate him.

526
01:00:43,815 --> 01:00:46,818
It just ate him. Christ!

527
01:00:47,068 --> 01:00:48,778
I'm not moving.

528
01:00:49,028 --> 01:00:51,072
I'm not moving. Someone will come.

529
01:00:51,322 --> 01:00:55,076
They'll come and they'll get us,
and we'll be fine.

530
01:00:55,326 --> 01:00:57,495
No. I'm not moving.

531
01:00:57,745 --> 01:01:02,875
Listen, Tom, what is the precise
structural failure limit for Aquatica?

532
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:04,126
3,200 tons.

533
01:01:04,376 --> 01:01:10,090
What happens when we get more
than 3,200 tons of water in this rig?

534
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:16,305
The support struts go first.
Their tolerance is about seven tons.

535
01:01:16,555 --> 01:01:18,599
They'll crack like toothpicks.

536
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:23,979
The walls will buckle. They can't handle
more than 10 tons of pressure.

537
01:01:29,901 --> 01:01:33,321
You want to be here for that?

538
01:01:39,327 --> 01:01:42,163
Hell, no.

539
01:01:44,958 --> 01:01:48,920
The moment of truth. Again.

540
01:02:02,934 --> 01:02:06,229
Go! Go! Go!

541
01:02:58,446 --> 01:03:01,157
I got you.

542
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:08,373
It's burning!

543
01:03:14,462 --> 01:03:15,963
The elevator's blocking the top.

544
01:03:16,214 --> 01:03:21,010
If we make it to Level 1,
we can take the stairs out.

545
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:56,837
Let's get out of here!

546
01:03:57,087 --> 01:04:00,215
Go! Go!

547
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:03,385
What are you doing?

548
01:04:03,635 --> 01:04:06,638
If they break through,
water will bring them right to us.

549
01:04:06,888 --> 01:04:10,183
Level 2 is only partially flooded.
If I can get that door open...

550
01:04:10,433 --> 01:04:15,230
...the water will run off there,
buy us some time.

551
01:04:16,439 --> 01:04:18,483
Big, real big.

552
01:04:18,733 --> 01:04:22,278
-What's that?
-The size of your brass balls.

553
01:04:22,528 --> 01:04:25,573
Be careful.

554
01:04:33,581 --> 01:04:36,209
Go!

555
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:18,892
Jan, stay there!

556
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,733
Get me out of here, Carter!

557
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,527
I don't want to die!

558
01:06:28,777 --> 01:06:32,322
Grab my hand! Come on!

559
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,782
I can't!

560
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:36,910
I can't reach!

561
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:41,331
-Take it!
-I can't reach!

562
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:31,713
Can you reach that door above you?

563
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:36,343
It's too high.

564
01:07:36,593 --> 01:07:39,638
It's too high.

565
01:08:00,283 --> 01:08:04,162
Sharks probably flooded that level too.

566
01:08:35,693 --> 01:08:38,570
Good thing you came to this side.
The other side's underwater.

567
01:08:38,821 --> 01:08:41,699
-We didn't exactly plan it.
-Yeah, it wasn't planned.

568
01:08:41,949 --> 01:08:45,369
Are you all that made it?

569
01:08:50,666 --> 01:08:51,875
We did it.

570
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:55,337
We're on Level 1.
We can take the stairs to the surface.

571
01:08:55,587 --> 01:08:57,631
The stairs are flooded. Trust me, I know.

572
01:08:57,881 --> 01:09:00,342
Are you sure?

573
01:09:00,592 --> 01:09:04,721
Give us a goddamn break, can't You?

574
01:09:14,773 --> 01:09:17,150
He always answers.

575
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:22,113
Sometimes, the answer you get
isn't the answer you want.

576
01:09:25,074 --> 01:09:27,910
We're 60 feet from the surface.

577
01:09:28,161 --> 01:09:31,914
There's an emergency hatch
on this level, right?

578
01:09:32,165 --> 01:09:34,584
This level has bilge pumps on it
for storm runoff.

579
01:09:34,834 --> 01:09:39,797
If we re-route the emergency generators,
we could drain a stairway.

580
01:09:40,047 --> 01:09:41,298
You sure?

581
01:09:41,549 --> 01:09:44,718
Who you going to trust?

582
01:09:46,762 --> 01:09:48,305
-You.
-That's right.

583
01:09:48,556 --> 01:09:51,600
You trust me.

584
01:09:59,608 --> 01:10:02,236
We had poker here tomorrow night.

585
01:10:02,486 --> 01:10:05,948
She'd always draw to the inside straight
when she could've stuck with a pair.

586
01:10:06,198 --> 01:10:09,242
Big dreams.

587
01:10:14,873 --> 01:10:19,252
Even in death: Standards.

588
01:10:19,711 --> 01:10:24,674
Jan was a healthy girl.
Something in here has to run on batteries.

589
01:10:24,924 --> 01:10:28,803
-Nice.
-Where would a girl keep her...

590
01:10:29,053 --> 01:10:29,888
...thing?

591
01:10:30,138 --> 01:10:32,849
What's the matter with you?

592
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,024
My skin's starting to hemorrhage.

593
01:10:42,275 --> 01:10:45,736
The sharks smell the blood.

594
01:10:45,987 --> 01:10:47,321
This'll coat it with oil.

595
01:10:47,572 --> 01:10:51,367
Look, Carter, what you said down there...

596
01:10:51,617 --> 01:10:54,704
...maybe you were right.

597
01:10:54,954 --> 01:10:58,374
Everything I've done...

598
01:10:58,916 --> 01:11:01,961
...I don't think I could've done it
without you.

599
01:11:02,211 --> 01:11:07,508
I know, Susan. That's the problem.

600
01:11:08,342 --> 01:11:10,135
Four a.m.

601
01:11:10,386 --> 01:11:11,512
I know.

602
01:11:11,762 --> 01:11:14,890
One night feels like a whole week.

603
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:16,725
Relativity.

604
01:11:16,975 --> 01:11:18,227
What do you mean?

605
01:11:18,477 --> 01:11:21,146
Einstein's theory of relativity.

606
01:11:21,396 --> 01:11:25,108
Grab hold of a hot pan,
a second can seem like an hour.

607
01:11:25,358 --> 01:11:27,694
Put your hands on a hot woman...

608
01:11:27,944 --> 01:11:30,155
...an hour can seem like a second.

609
01:11:30,405 --> 01:11:33,783
It's all relative.

610
01:11:36,161 --> 01:11:42,333
I spent four years at Cal Tech. That's
the best physics explanation I've heard.

611
01:11:43,835 --> 01:11:46,671
It works.

612
01:11:46,754 --> 01:11:48,339
You stay with the doc.

613
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:51,175
Me and Scoggs are going to try
to get to the wet lab...

614
01:11:51,426 --> 01:11:54,887
...drain that stairwell.

615
01:11:57,056 --> 01:12:00,393
-Preach?
-What?

616
01:12:00,977 --> 01:12:04,689
Would you zip me up, please?

617
01:12:34,593 --> 01:12:37,012
We got one, there's two sharks left...

618
01:12:37,262 --> 01:12:40,474
...and you and the doc are doing
a little bathroom love.

619
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:44,895
They got a pill for what's wrong with you?

620
01:12:53,945 --> 01:12:58,116
I need to get some things
from my quarters. Research data.

621
01:12:58,366 --> 01:13:00,785
The tests, they worked.

622
01:13:01,035 --> 01:13:06,541
So much death around us,
to risk any more life for some numbers....

623
01:13:06,874 --> 01:13:11,629
Without that data, everyone dying
isn't just tragic, it's useless.

624
01:13:11,879 --> 01:13:15,758
Death is always useless, Doctor.

625
01:13:25,184 --> 01:13:28,229
This is it.

626
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:36,028
Stay here. I'll be back before you know it.

627
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

628
01:14:45,763 --> 01:14:47,473
What's going on?

629
01:14:47,723 --> 01:14:49,683
What the hell's going on? What is that?

630
01:14:49,933 --> 01:14:51,352
It's okay!

631
01:14:51,602 --> 01:14:53,562
-What is that?
-We're all right!

632
01:14:53,812 --> 01:14:57,858
-What the fuck?
-It's okay.

633
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:02,279
I thought you were coming back for me.

634
01:15:02,529 --> 01:15:05,449
One of your monitors is blocking the panel.

635
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:07,659
You want to help me move it?

636
01:15:07,909 --> 01:15:11,955
I say we do everything right together.

637
01:15:12,164 --> 01:15:14,791
Right together.

638
01:15:27,762 --> 01:15:29,806
Hello.

639
01:15:30,056 --> 01:15:32,767
My name is Sherman Dudley...

640
01:15:33,017 --> 01:15:37,814
...and if this message finds you,
I did not survive, so this is my legacy.

641
01:15:38,064 --> 01:15:42,235
I have loved the pulpit
and I have loved the bottle.

642
01:15:42,485 --> 01:15:46,864
I did my best to be a good husband,
a f ather.

643
01:15:47,114 --> 01:15:49,784
I came up wanting.

644
01:15:50,034 --> 01:15:53,537
So what do I have to say to you?

645
01:15:53,788 --> 01:15:57,833
What mark do I have to leave behind?

646
01:16:02,296 --> 01:16:05,549
We'll begin with the perfect omelet,
made with two eggs, not three.

647
01:16:05,799 --> 01:16:10,512
Amateurs often add milk for density.
This is a mistake.

648
01:18:44,538 --> 01:18:47,416
Come on!

649
01:19:18,696 --> 01:19:22,116
I got you. Come on.

650
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:37,631
Damn you, Scoggs.

651
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:50,060
Where's Susan?

652
01:19:51,145 --> 01:19:52,020
I'm done.

653
01:19:52,271 --> 01:19:57,442
Brothers never make it out
of situations like this. Not ever!

654
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

655
01:23:57,844 --> 01:23:59,095
Did you do it?

656
01:23:59,346 --> 01:24:02,348
Where's Scoggins?

657
01:24:03,892 --> 01:24:06,561
I hate to interrupt this moment
of burgeoning intimacy...

658
01:24:06,811 --> 01:24:10,189
...but can we get the fuck out of here?

659
01:24:19,699 --> 01:24:21,534
-Is this the only way?
-Exits are flooded.

660
01:24:21,784 --> 01:24:26,038
Whole place is sinking.
It's this way or no way at all.

661
01:24:26,289 --> 01:24:28,708
You can bring on the good news
anytime now.

662
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:32,670
Sharks are attracted to churning water,
bright colors.

663
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:36,590
These extinguishers will be a distraction.

664
01:24:36,841 --> 01:24:38,133
What about us?

665
01:24:38,384 --> 01:24:43,263
The vest'll bring you up too fast.
Your lungs'll pop like a balloon.

666
01:24:43,514 --> 01:24:45,474
You weren't the sunny kid in your class.

667
01:24:45,724 --> 01:24:48,310
I never went to class.

668
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,896
How far to the surface? Sixty feet?

669
01:24:51,146 --> 01:24:52,064
There's nothing to it.

670
01:24:52,314 --> 01:24:56,902
Exhale on the way up,
and get the hell out of the water.

671
01:24:57,152 --> 01:25:01,239
I got to equalize the pressure
before we blow the air lock.

672
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:04,576
I got to let the room fill up with water.

673
01:25:04,826 --> 01:25:07,871
It'll only take a few seconds.

674
01:25:08,121 --> 01:25:10,498
You ready?

675
01:25:10,749 --> 01:25:12,500
No.

676
01:25:12,751 --> 01:25:15,378
Not in the least.

677
01:25:32,895 --> 01:25:35,565
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

678
01:25:35,815 --> 01:25:37,191
"...I shall fear no evil...

679
01:25:37,441 --> 01:25:38,734
"...for Thou art with me...

680
01:25:38,985 --> 01:25:41,279
"...Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.

681
01:25:41,529 --> 01:25:45,908
"Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life... "

682
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:47,952
...because I carry a big stick...

683
01:25:48,202 --> 01:25:50,663
...and I'm the meanest motherfucker
in the valley.

684
01:25:50,913 --> 01:25:53,958
Two sharks down, Lord.
One demon fish to go.

685
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:55,501
Can I get an "amen"?

686
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:56,418
Amen!

687
01:25:56,669 --> 01:25:59,672
-I can't hear you!
-Amen!

688
01:25:59,922 --> 01:26:01,090
Give me an "amen"!

689
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:04,885
-Stay with us, Lord!
-Amen.

690
01:26:06,428 --> 01:26:08,764
Okay, hold on three! Ready?

691
01:26:09,014 --> 01:26:12,684
One! Two! Three!

692
01:27:47,277 --> 01:27:50,071
Swim!

693
01:28:26,565 --> 01:28:29,443
Oh, my God!

694
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:09,232
It's the devil, you know.

695
01:29:19,033 --> 01:29:23,287
He'll be okay if we can get out of here.

696
01:29:33,797 --> 01:29:35,466
Son of a bitch.

697
01:29:35,716 --> 01:29:36,675
What?

698
01:29:36,926 --> 01:29:42,848
Those fences are titanium underneath,
but on top, they're just plain steel.

699
01:29:43,682 --> 01:29:46,560
They've been herding us,
pushing us where they want.

700
01:29:46,810 --> 01:29:50,689
Using us to flood the facility.

701
01:29:51,356 --> 01:29:53,483
Oh, my God.

702
01:29:53,734 --> 01:29:55,360
That's the answer to the riddle.

703
01:29:55,610 --> 01:29:59,614
Because that's what
an 8,000-pound mako thinks about.

704
01:29:59,865 --> 01:30:02,993
About freedom.

705
01:30:03,326 --> 01:30:06,997
About the deep blue sea.

706
01:30:08,415 --> 01:30:11,751
We have to kill her.

707
01:30:12,502 --> 01:30:17,465
That's the first real smart thing
you've said all day.

708
01:30:20,468 --> 01:30:23,263
Here we go.

709
01:30:39,236 --> 01:30:42,323
Let's go.

710
01:30:51,206 --> 01:30:56,503
We ought to get 2.5 sticks of dynamite
out of these flares.

711
01:31:00,507 --> 01:31:03,010
From up here, you ought to be able
to see me spear it.

712
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:05,804
When I do, you take this end of this cable...

713
01:31:06,054 --> 01:31:08,724
...hook it up to the positive side
of the boat battery.

714
01:31:08,974 --> 01:31:11,893
And boom!

715
01:31:47,136 --> 01:31:49,388
Damn! I can't get her!

716
01:31:49,639 --> 01:31:53,017
She's too far away!

717
01:31:53,309 --> 01:31:55,478
I know how to get her.

718
01:31:55,728 --> 01:31:58,022
How?

719
01:31:58,272 --> 01:32:00,816
Bait.

720
01:32:13,704 --> 01:32:16,206
She may be the smartest animal
in the world...

721
01:32:16,457 --> 01:32:20,502
...but she's still just an animal.

722
01:32:20,502 --> 01:32:23,463
Come to Mama.

723
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:38,603
No!

724
01:32:41,356 --> 01:32:44,234
Susan, don't!

725
01:32:58,998 --> 01:33:02,210
Get out of the water!

726
01:34:55,195 --> 01:34:56,530
All right, Lord....

727
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:58,281
Shoot it, Preach!

728
01:34:58,532 --> 01:34:59,991
This is for Scoggins.

729
01:35:00,242 --> 01:35:02,911
Shoot it!

730
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:11,252
Damn!

731
01:35:15,215 --> 01:35:17,675
Blow it, Preach! Blow it!

732
01:35:17,926 --> 01:35:19,093
The battery!

733
01:35:19,344 --> 01:35:22,180
Blow it!

734
01:35:24,766 --> 01:35:27,894
Do it!

735
01:36:28,536 --> 01:36:31,873
Bring me some sushi!

736
01:36:55,396 --> 01:36:57,022
Forty-five-foot shark...

737
01:36:57,273 --> 01:36:59,066
...and you hit me.

738
01:36:59,316 --> 01:37:01,068
Nice.

739
01:37:01,318 --> 01:37:05,990
Could've been worse.
I could've let him eat your ass.

740
01:37:11,745 --> 01:37:14,122
Hey, Carter, we're sinking, right?

741
01:37:14,373 --> 01:37:16,166
Yeah.

742
01:37:16,416 --> 01:37:19,628
Let me ask you something.

743
01:37:19,878 --> 01:37:22,464
Are you sure it was just three sharks?

744
01:37:22,714 --> 01:37:26,342
- Yeah.
- Oh, Okay.

745
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:37,520
That's more like it.

746
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:46,905
Here comes the next shift.

747
01:37:47,155 --> 01:37:48,865
Let me tell you, man...

748
01:37:49,115 --> 01:37:52,493
...I quit this job.

749
01:37:55,121 --> 01:37:57,707
Take me back to the ghetto.

750
01:37:57,957 --> 01:38:00,835
Amen.

751
01:38:28,834 --> 01:38:34,834
