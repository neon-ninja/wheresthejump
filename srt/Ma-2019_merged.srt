00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:01,074
Honey, quit picking at it.

3
00:02:01,076 --> 00:02:02,907
Are you nervous or what?

4
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,707
Yeah, a little.
It's a pretty big school.

5
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,841
Well, first days
are always a little goofy,

6
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:10,541
but you and I
are gonna be fine.

7
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:12,909
We are modern babes
in a modern world.

8
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:15,809
Oh, my God, how am I
related to you?

9
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:53,082
Hey. Do you need some help?

10
00:02:53,084 --> 00:02:56,749
Um, yeah. Maybe.

11
00:02:56,751 --> 00:02:57,950
It didn't charge right
last night,

12
00:02:57,952 --> 00:02:59,849
- so it's low on juice.
- Here. Hold up.

13
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:01,886
- Let me get you.
- Oh.

14
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,985
So, which way are you headed?

15
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,518
All I needed was a push.
It should be enough.

16
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,954
Oh. Okay.

17
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:14,086
Thanks for being so nice.

18
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:17,752
- You're a lifesaver.
- Yeah. You, too.

19
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:19,455
"You, too"?

20
00:03:23,722 --> 00:03:26,921
You are Erica. I am Stu.

21
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:28,754
We are now coworkers.

22
00:03:28,756 --> 00:03:31,056
Nice to meet you, Stu.

23
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:32,889
How's your first day
on the floor going?

24
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:35,722
Is it everything you ever
dreamed of and so much more?

25
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:38,589
Sure beats having a desk job.

26
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:52,125
Okay...

27
00:03:52,127 --> 00:03:55,561
Okay.

28
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:09,628
You do have a nice ass.

29
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,695
I noticed it this morning.
I'm very perceptive.

30
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:12,929
I'm not, like...

31
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:14,929
a lesbian or anything.

32
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:17,529
You're new, on a Friday,

33
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:19,763
in February,
which is very weird.

34
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:20,997
Military brat?

35
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:22,697
Uh, no.

36
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:24,731
Uh, yeah, I'm Maggie.

37
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:25,998
Today's my first day.

38
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,031
- I transferred.
- That sucks.

39
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:30,131
- I was new last year, so I get it.
- Mm.

40
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:32,068
Um...

41
00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:04,660
Stephanie, are you still
having people over

42
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:05,693
for a party tomorrow?

43
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:07,093
- Yeah.
- Cool.

44
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:09,296
You can come with us
if you want.

45
00:05:10,863 --> 00:05:13,227
- Haley.
- Yeah.

46
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,495
Thanks. I'm going to
the music festival with my mom.

47
00:05:15,497 --> 00:05:16,862
So...

48
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:18,462
Okay.

49
00:05:18,464 --> 00:05:21,496
Damn, a lot of people
would kill to be so popular.

50
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:23,396
- Okay.
- Have fun with your mom

51
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:25,563
and all those
fucking old people.

52
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,066
Shit.

53
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,234
Shit, shit.

54
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:44,635
Shit.

55
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:47,467
Hey, what's wrong?

56
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:49,867
Well, nothing. I'm just...

57
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:52,568
I have to cover
for somebody now at work.

58
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,535
What about the music festival?

59
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:58,269
Well, there's not much
I can do about it, honey.

60
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:01,702
I'm the new kid,
and we got to make money, so...

61
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:04,570
I made you some pancakes.

62
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,870
All right, I'll text you
a little later, okay?

63
00:06:07,872 --> 00:06:09,504
Bye.

64
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:42,409
Whoo!

65
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:43,676
Maggie came to party.

66
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:45,677
Maggie came to party.

67
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:46,677
Get in. Go.

68
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:48,377
Faster, faster. Boys...

69
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,477
Maggie.

70
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:50,677
- Yo, what's up?
- Maggie, boys.

71
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,344
How you doing, Maggie?

72
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,311
Oh, you-you might know me.
I'm Darrell.

73
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,578
- Okay.
- That's Andy.

74
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,512
- Hi.
- And this gay dude is Chaz.

75
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:59,445
- Yeah, I'm-I'm very straight.
- HALEY and DARRELL: Super gay.

76
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:01,445
- I love pussy. Babe, tell 'em.
- Super gay.

77
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:03,580
- Tell 'em I love pussy, babe.
- So, the party's canceled.

78
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:05,146
Stephanie's mom's
a complete bitch.

79
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:06,446
And I think
we're just gonna, like,

80
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:07,547
drive around and get drunk.

81
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:08,713
- Okay.
- Is that cool?

82
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,147
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Very cool.

83
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:11,481
- Are you sure?
- Super cool.

84
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:12,681
- Great.
- All right, let's do it.

85
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,315
Let's get drunk!

86
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:24,249
Hey, hey, mister, uh,
can you, uh...

87
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:26,316
Yup. Nah.

88
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:30,217
Literally looks like
he's gonna throw up.

89
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:32,119
Dude always looks like that.

90
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,385
Want a drag?

91
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:38,184
It's cotton candy.

92
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:40,419
- No, I'm good.
- What, you don't vape?

93
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:41,686
- No.
- Come on, you're in high school.

94
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:43,586
You can smoke
as much as you want

95
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,253
until you're 25 and then quit,
and nothing bad will happen.

96
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,287
Here we go.

97
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:52,388
- Hey, sir, can you, uh...
- Piss off, boy.

98
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:56,555
He's too desperate about it.

99
00:07:56,557 --> 00:07:59,322
Hey, yo, man,
this shit racist out here.

100
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:00,589
- Your turn.
- Nope. Not me.

101
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:02,489
The guy that works here
knows my stepdad.

102
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:03,890
I vote Maggie.

103
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:06,223
She's new,
and no one knows who she is.

104
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:09,124
And truthfully, you could be
a narc, and that scares me.

105
00:08:09,126 --> 00:08:11,658
Look, if the cops come,
just cry. They'll let you off.

106
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,424
What? They never let me off.

107
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,525
Yeah, 'cause they know
you nasty.

108
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:18,325
Darrell.

109
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:20,659
Mm-hmm.

110
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:24,293
- Hi. Excuse me. Could...
- Get lost.

111
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,193
Hey.

112
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:28,427
Be more confident.

113
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:30,427
Hey, what you got for me?

114
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:31,694
- Hey, come on.
- Uh-uh.

115
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:33,295
Not today. Not today.

116
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:34,463
Come on, sweetie.

117
00:08:36,297 --> 00:08:38,228
Come on.

118
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,131
Got to do one more lap.

119
00:08:41,665 --> 00:08:43,696
- Um...
- Come on.

120
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:46,130
- Excuse me? Hi.
- Yeah?

121
00:08:46,132 --> 00:08:48,597
Um, would you mind buying this
for my friends and I?

122
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:50,330
I have money for it.

123
00:08:50,332 --> 00:08:52,331
Not interested, kid.

124
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,698
- Come on.
- I know it's... I know it's weird, but please?

125
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,532
You want to spend the night
in jail?

126
00:08:57,534 --> 00:08:59,632
Does that sound fun to you?

127
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:01,265
The fuck?

128
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:03,466
- Andy, can we just go?
- Yeah, let's roll. Yeah.

129
00:09:03,468 --> 00:09:05,068
Sorry.

130
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:08,600
Oh.

131
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:10,603
Okay.

132
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:14,267
Now I see what's going on.

133
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:17,468
A man sending a girl
to do his dirty work.

134
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,201
Guys, I used to do

135
00:09:19,203 --> 00:09:20,602
the same thing
when I was your age.

136
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:22,236
We're sorry.

137
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:24,269
Could you hook us up, though?

138
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:27,571
Mm. I wouldn't be able
to live with myself

139
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:29,304
if you got into an accident.

140
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:30,671
Oh, well, I'm driving,
and I don't drink.

141
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:32,571
We were just gonna go to
the rock pile for a little bit.

142
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,572
I promise. Just...

143
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,138
Mm.

144
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,705
I know where that is.

145
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:38,606
Shoot.

146
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:42,274
We used to hang out there
all the time when I was a kid.

147
00:09:52,443 --> 00:09:55,374
Hell. Hold this dog.

148
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:57,442
Yes!

149
00:09:57,444 --> 00:09:58,709
And don't tell.

150
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:00,611
No.

151
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:05,412
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Sue Ann.

152
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:10,911
Hey, y'all know dogs kill
more people than sharks, right?

153
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:13,444
That's great, Darrell.
Thank you.

154
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,345
What?

155
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:17,612
Whoo! There's my girl.

156
00:10:17,614 --> 00:10:20,713
Okay. They didn't have
whatever Fireball is,

157
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
so I got After Shock.
- Yeah.
- Man said it's the same thing.
This never happened, okay?
- Whoop.
- Thanks again for doing this, ma'am.
For doing what, darling?

158
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:31,581
Come on, baby.

159
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,617
Come on, sweetie.

160
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,715
Yo, that old chick wants
to sit on your face, dude.

161
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:40,516
- What, you think so?
- Like, your entire face.

162
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:46,150
- Smash her back.
- Dude, I don't know.

163
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:48,350
- Oh, come on. Guys.
- That's not really...

164
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:51,618
All right,
I would... I would smash.

165
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,384
- Hey. - CHAZ: Whoa!
- Oh, my God.

166
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,718
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit.

167
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,552
Your change.
I'm not some thug.

168
00:10:58,554 --> 00:11:00,919
No, of course not. Thanks.

169
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:03,655
- Thanks again.
- Drive safe.

170
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:20,422
Sue Ann!

171
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:22,425
Go clean out the kennels!

172
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:29,624
Bingo.

173
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:32,490
Oh, hey, could you
get me some lunch first?

174
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:41,759
All right, someone start
the fire, assholes. Let's go.

175
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:43,259
Let's all get shit-faced.

176
00:11:46,162 --> 00:11:48,160
Seems pretty secluded.

177
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:49,560
Yeah, sadly,
this is pretty much

178
00:11:49,562 --> 00:11:51,394
the best drinking spot in town.

179
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:53,628
So, when did you get here?
From where?

180
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,695
From San Diego,
like a week ago.

181
00:11:55,697 --> 00:11:57,295
Oh, yeah. That's, uh...

182
00:11:57,297 --> 00:11:58,495
that's enough time to realize

183
00:11:58,497 --> 00:12:00,529
there's nothing to do
in this town.

184
00:12:00,531 --> 00:12:02,162
It sucks.

185
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:03,296
- Sorry. I'll stop.
- Thanks.

186
00:12:03,298 --> 00:12:04,763
You live here now.

187
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,730
It's not the worst.

188
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:10,698
Kind of just like
anywhere else.

189
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,433
Not anymore.

190
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,632
Guys, what are you doing?

191
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:18,467
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Come on, man.

192
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:39,471
Yeah, we're good. We're good.

193
00:12:41,738 --> 00:12:44,402
Yes, hello? This is Ben.

194
00:12:44,404 --> 00:12:47,303
Um, Ben Hawkins?

195
00:12:47,305 --> 00:12:49,270
Hawkins Security?

196
00:12:49,272 --> 00:12:51,538
Yes. Who is this?

197
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,938
A young man you know
just might be drinking booze

198
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,372
with his friends
out at the rock piles.

199
00:12:57,374 --> 00:12:59,939
And who might I know?

200
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:01,939
Andy.

201
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:04,239
Okay. Who am I speaking to?

202
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,573
A little birdie.

203
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:08,541
Sue Ann?

204
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:11,207
- Why isn't this dog prepped?
- Oh, I-I just...

205
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:12,407
You know what? I don't want
to see you anymore today.

206
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:14,407
Go. You go home,
and I'll prep this dog.

207
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:16,241
Do it myself.

208
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:18,508
And stay off your damn phone.

209
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,244
Sit.

210
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:29,544
No, no, no, no.
No. No, no.

211
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:31,744
Ow.

212
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:34,511
Shit.

213
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:37,945
Don't dab.

214
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:39,479
I don't think
you should dab anymore.

215
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:40,546
Yeah.

216
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:42,179
Maggie.

217
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:43,679
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

218
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:46,480
- You got to try this. It's my favorite.
- Okay. Okay.

219
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:47,714
Oh, you don't have to
if you don't want to.

220
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:49,413
- No, no, I want to.
- No, she has to.

221
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:50,548
- Okay.
- I have to.

222
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,214
Take a sip. Take a sip.

223
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:55,715
Oh, my God.

224
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:57,616
- Hell yeah. It's very strong.
- It's fucking strong.

225
00:13:57,618 --> 00:14:00,248
- - Fuck.
- Oh, fuck, that's a cop.

226
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,115
- Andy, where's the weed?
- What? Okay, wait.

227
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:03,283
- I got the weed. Okay.
- Put it away.

228
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:04,783
- Let's go, let's go.
- Do I hide? - Shh, shh.

229
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:05,717
No! Maggie! Come here.

230
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,950
- No? I don't hide?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

231
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:09,484
- Okay.
- You're-you're a girl. He's not gonna do anything.

232
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:11,217
- You're fine. Shh.
- My mom's gonna fucking kill me

233
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:12,651
- if I go to prison.
- Act cute. Act cute. Act...

234
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:14,518
Come on out.

235
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,485
- Oh, oh, okay, sir.
- I said get out here!

236
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:18,218
- I-I'm sorry.
- Come on! Right now!

237
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,518
- Okay.
- You, too, bud.

238
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,421
Come on. Get out here.

239
00:14:24,455 --> 00:14:26,319
I just got a phone call
from somebody,

240
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:27,621
telling me that there were
some teenagers

241
00:14:27,623 --> 00:14:29,623
drinking out at the rock piles.

242
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:32,555
You seen anybody out here,
young lady?

243
00:14:32,557 --> 00:14:35,755
- Sir, we don't have any...
- Wrong young lady.

244
00:14:35,757 --> 00:14:37,622
Put your arms out.
Put 'em out!

245
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:40,391
- Wide. Back up. Move back.
- Mm.

246
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:50,560
Your daddy sent me out here
to arrest you.

247
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:59,359
I played football with your dad
in high school.

248
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:00,759
And he's a dick.

249
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:03,360
So...

250
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,560
I'm gonna come back
in ten minutes,

251
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:08,427
and all your shit out here
is gonna be gone. You got it?

252
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:09,494
- Yep. - Yeah, I-I got it.
- Do you?

253
00:15:09,496 --> 00:15:10,661
- Yeah, I think... - Yes.
- All right, get your shit,

254
00:15:10,663 --> 00:15:11,661
and let's get out of here.

255
00:15:11,663 --> 00:15:13,396
- Okay.
- Right now.

256
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:16,729
So, I want to go home.

257
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:17,829
How is that funny?

258
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:19,662
- Dude! How did...
- We would have been

259
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:21,465
shot the fuck up.

260
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:26,631
Shit.

261
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:29,332
- Hey.
- Hey.

262
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:36,765
You smell like pot.

263
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:39,399
I didn't smoke anything.

264
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:41,265
Who were you with?

265
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:43,532
Just some kids from school.
I-I left you a note.

266
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:45,400
Yeah, you leave a note
when you're up to something.

267
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,734
Why didn't you just text me?

268
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:48,667
Uh, I don't know.
My phone died.

269
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:50,501
We just drove around.

270
00:15:50,503 --> 00:15:53,401
- And you got high. Maggie.
- I didn't smoke anything.

271
00:15:53,403 --> 00:15:55,401
And they asked me just
to go out, so I said okay.

272
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:56,535
It's really not
that big a deal.

273
00:15:56,537 --> 00:15:57,769
I'm not gonna be
some fucking loser

274
00:15:57,771 --> 00:15:59,502
and tell them not to smoke
'cause I don't.

275
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:01,268
Do not talk to me like that.

276
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,703
- Come back here.
- Why should I wait around for you

277
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:06,236
while you're at work all day?
How is that fair?

278
00:16:06,238 --> 00:16:09,371
I'm glad you're fitting in.
I really am.

279
00:16:09,373 --> 00:16:12,404
I want you to make
smarter decisions than that.

280
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:15,307
Like all the amazing decisions
you've made.

281
00:16:21,408 --> 00:16:23,239
Hi.

282
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:26,741
I'm Erica. Uh, I'm dropping
this boy off for shots.

283
00:16:26,743 --> 00:16:28,240
This is Louie.

284
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:30,240
Well, you're right
on time, Erica.

285
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:32,240
Actually, I'm running late
for work.

286
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,274
Can I just fill this out later?

287
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:36,477
Oh, yeah, just-just sign the
bottom, and I'll do the rest.

288
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:40,776
- Thank you.
- Mm.

289
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:51,578
Sue Ann.

290
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,211
Sue Ann!

291
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,545
Answer the fucking...

292
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:58,412
Brooks Veterinary.

293
00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:02,212
Yeah, hold on, Mrs. Macy.
We'll get your file.

294
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:04,548
Why aren't you
answering the phones?

295
00:17:06,548 --> 00:17:09,247
Sorry.
I'm fighting a migraine.

296
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:10,414
Well, go get
some horse tranquilizer.

297
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,681
I don't care. Do your job.

298
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,250
Come on, boy. Come on.

299
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:23,750
I'm marathoning
John Hughes movies,

300
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:24,983
if you want to hang.

301
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:26,984
Have you seen <i>Pretty in Pink?</i>

302
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:29,217
Well, no, I'm hanging out
with Haley, remember?

303
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:30,419
Oh, yeah.

304
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:34,318
You look like
you're going to see a boy.

305
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,218
Are you going to meet a boy?

306
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,785
- No.
- No?

307
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:39,986
We're-we're just friends.

308
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:43,285
Okay, well, be smart,
and call me

309
00:17:43,287 --> 00:17:45,620
if you need me to come get you.
I won't be mad.

310
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:47,387
- Promise?
- Promise.

311
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:48,787
- Okay.
- Okay, I love you.

312
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:51,256
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

313
00:17:59,591 --> 00:18:02,390
Yo, why the fuck is she
putting it in her truck?

314
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:03,990
Oh, I bet it smell
like ass in there, too.

315
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:05,456
Guys.

316
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,523
Oh, here she comes,
here she comes.

317
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:10,824
Okay. I got two bottles
of Parrot Bay,

318
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:12,591
uh, 18-pack of Bud Light,

319
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:15,225
- and they had the Fireball this time.
- Ah, sweet.

320
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,725
- Thank you.
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

321
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,326
Why don't you just, uh,
follow me down the street,

322
00:18:21,328 --> 00:18:23,459
and you can pay me
and get the stuff.

323
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:25,760
I got eyes on me.
I don't want to lose my job.

324
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:27,327
Cool. Yeah, I'll follow you.

325
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:28,827
Secret hand-offs?

326
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:32,230
Are you freaking kidding me
right now? Fuck yes!

327
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,629
Okay.

328
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:42,329
I feel like she really
doesn't want to get caught.

329
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,298
It wouldn't be so bad
if she didn't drive so slow.

330
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:05,000
- This place is creepy.
- All right.

331
00:19:05,002 --> 00:19:06,769
- This is fucking sketchy.
- No, it's good.

332
00:19:12,536 --> 00:19:15,502
No, I think she wants to
bang him for real.

333
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:17,301
Oh, shut up.

334
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:18,368
What, are you jealous, Maggie?
You jealous?

335
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,236
Shh, shh, shh.
Wait, he's talking to her.

336
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:21,605
He's... Shh.

337
00:19:23,304 --> 00:19:24,403
Did you give her the money?

338
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:25,336
Uh, well, kind of.

339
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:26,771
She said we could hang out
in her basement

340
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:28,504
if we didn't want
to drive around all night.

341
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:31,570
I didn't know what to say.

342
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:33,672
I mean, I'm down.
I got to pee really bad.

343
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,438
No. No, no, no, no.

344
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,304
We don't, we don't know
this chick, so...

345
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:38,572
- No.
- No cops, though.

346
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:40,341
What do you think?

347
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:43,472
Okay.

348
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,440
- Whoa! - Aah!
- Yes!

349
00:19:45,442 --> 00:19:47,340
- Okay...
- All right, let's go!

350
00:19:47,342 --> 00:19:49,507
- Are y'all serious?
- Yes! Get out.

351
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:51,841
- I got to pee!
- Whoo! Fuck yeah.

352
00:19:51,843 --> 00:19:53,574
You guys come on in.

353
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:54,841
Come on in.

354
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:57,642
It calms me down so much
to know

355
00:19:57,644 --> 00:20:00,242
that you guys aren't out there
drinking and driving.

356
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:02,443
I mean, to be honest,
I would rather you be safe.

357
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:03,576
If you're gonna do it
somewhere,

358
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:04,743
might as well be here, right?

359
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,543
Do you have a bathroom
I can use?

360
00:20:06,545 --> 00:20:08,644
It ain't much,
but it's all you.

361
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:10,678
- Thanks.
- Okay.

362
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,778
The bar is open.

363
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,545
Wow. Nobody's been
down here a minute.

364
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,812
- Ugh.
- Weird, though.

365
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:20,346
Oh, that's nasty.

366
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:26,514
Is it just me,
or is it cold in here?

367
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,747
Yo, this place smells like

368
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:29,683
my great-grandmother's house.

369
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:33,682
Jesus Christ.

370
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:35,682
Okay, everybody,
listen up real quick.

371
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:37,715
My only house rules are:

372
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:40,549
- Don't take the Lord's name in vain.
- Sorry.

373
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:42,749
And don't spit
on my floors, please.

374
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:44,850
Oh, and you...
I'm gonna need your keys.

375
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:47,650
You got to check in with me
before walking out that door,

376
00:20:47,652 --> 00:20:49,417
'cause I got to know
you're safe to drive.

377
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:50,618
Cool. Yeah. Fine.

378
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,518
Okay, oh,
and nobody go upstairs.

379
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,351
That's my world,
and right now it's a mess.

380
00:20:55,353 --> 00:20:56,852
So, uh, you guys are free to do

381
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:59,285
whatever you want to do
down here, but, you know...

382
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:00,452
Hell yeah...

383
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:02,253
Heck yeah.

384
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:03,353
Thanks, lady.

385
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:04,853
I'll get you some cups and ice.

386
00:21:04,855 --> 00:21:06,720
Uh, excuse me.

387
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:08,554
What's your name?

388
00:21:08,556 --> 00:21:10,621
Sue Ann.
What's yours?

389
00:21:10,623 --> 00:21:14,755
Darrell. That's, uh, Andy,
Chaz, Haley and Maggie.

390
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:17,355
You got any Pizza Rolls, Ma?

391
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:19,655
"Ma"?

392
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:21,856
Boy, you are too much.

393
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:23,556
I'll get you some snacks.

394
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:25,523
Go ahead and, uh,
make yourselves at home.

395
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:27,424
Guys, this is so sick.

396
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:31,323
Oh, my God.

397
00:21:45,696 --> 00:21:47,696
Mmm.

398
00:21:51,363 --> 00:21:52,861
- Oh, if it's personal...
- Oh, that's gangster, bro.

399
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:53,795
No, no, it's fine.

400
00:21:53,797 --> 00:21:55,761
Um, my dad left my mom
for someone else,

401
00:21:55,763 --> 00:21:58,595
and I don't think she really
had anywhere else to go.

402
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:00,362
Oh, you guys are cute.

403
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:02,598
Eee. It's nice.

404
00:22:07,598 --> 00:22:09,831
- Okay.
- Oh, that's a lot.

405
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:13,264
- Here we go. Oh.
- Bro, you are not good at those tricks, dawg.

406
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:15,465
I had Pizza Rolls, Darrell.

407
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,832
This place could be incredible.

408
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:20,700
You know what you need?
Okay, hear me out.

409
00:22:20,702 --> 00:22:22,666
Couch there.

410
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:23,866
Snack wall, bam.

411
00:22:23,868 --> 00:22:25,499
Maybe, like,
a projector situation

412
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:28,367
going on over here,
hang weird lights.

413
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:30,467
Speakers over there,
rugs all on here,

414
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:33,268
and then just, like, a real
table for flip cup, beer pong.

415
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,735
You get it.

416
00:22:34,737 --> 00:22:37,368
I'll get right on that
as soon as I win the lottery.

417
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,602
Then I can turn this place
into the Taj Mahal.

418
00:22:39,604 --> 00:22:41,271
I mean, unless you hate
being cool.

419
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:46,704
If you don't want to be cool,
that's on you.

420
00:22:46,706 --> 00:22:48,338
Just saying.

421
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:52,337
You want to see something cool?

422
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:53,339
Sure.

423
00:22:59,574 --> 00:23:01,372
Pretty cool, huh?

424
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:02,542
Oh, shit.

425
00:23:03,575 --> 00:23:05,208
Strip.

426
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:07,475
Get naked, boy.

427
00:23:23,812 --> 00:23:25,445
Oh, my God.

428
00:23:45,348 --> 00:23:48,513
You are under arrest
for being so dang cute.

429
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:50,815
Put that thing away.

430
00:23:50,817 --> 00:23:53,614
- And I'll put this thing away.
- Oh, my God.

431
00:23:53,616 --> 00:23:55,381
That-that was insane.

432
00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:56,749
This thing doesn't even work.

433
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:58,515
I found it
when I was moving in.

434
00:23:58,517 --> 00:23:59,615
What, y'all think I'm Madea?

435
00:23:59,617 --> 00:24:00,716
- Here, take it.
- Uh-uh. - No.

436
00:24:00,718 --> 00:24:03,349
- Toss it in a pond, for all I care.
- No, it's okay.

437
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:04,550
Pretty cool, huh?

438
00:24:05,752 --> 00:24:08,584
Ma, you fucking got me.

439
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:10,051
Are we cool?

440
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:11,751
We'll see.

441
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,885
You fucking scared
the shit out of me.

442
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,685
- I-I think I got to puke.
- She did.

443
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:19,552
We need to get
this one outside.

444
00:24:19,554 --> 00:24:21,753
Ma, all I...
I just need some pizza.

445
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:23,586
And you need a breath mint.

446
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:26,222
You got him?

447
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:31,353
Thanks for having us over,
Sue Ann.

448
00:24:31,355 --> 00:24:33,423
Oh, look at me.

449
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,388
Okay, follow my fingers.

450
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,322
Don't mess it up.

451
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:42,756
You're married?

452
00:24:42,758 --> 00:24:45,557
Uh, he left years ago.

453
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:48,490
My finger's too fat
to get it off, so...

454
00:24:48,492 --> 00:24:49,625
Thanks.

455
00:24:50,827 --> 00:24:52,825
It was nice to meet you.

456
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:54,758
And hey, thanks
for letting us hang out.

457
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,759
Oh, please.
I haven't had this much fun

458
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,625
in God knows how long.

459
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:00,792
Get home safe.

460
00:25:00,794 --> 00:25:02,795
That's all I care about.

461
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:06,359
A large sausage pizza.

462
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:07,693
A large sausage pizza?

463
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:10,761
Now you know
where the party is.

464
00:25:20,331 --> 00:25:22,362
We're headed back
to the rock piles tonight,

465
00:25:22,364 --> 00:25:23,763
if you want to come.

466
00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:25,496
Oh.

467
00:25:25,498 --> 00:25:26,764
We'll just drink a few beers,
whatever.

468
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:28,731
Well, that sounds cool.

469
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:30,363
- Thanks.
- Yeah?

470
00:25:30,365 --> 00:25:32,433
- See y'all tonight.
- Mm.

471
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,567
It'll be fun.

472
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:39,768
Yeah.

473
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,668
Oh, you're good, honey.

474
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,301
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah, it was cool.

475
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,804
It was no big deal.

476
00:26:58,781 --> 00:27:01,645
So, you just balance it out.
You find your center.

477
00:27:01,647 --> 00:27:03,613
- Okay.
- And then you go.

478
00:27:03,615 --> 00:27:05,513
That's how... One more...

479
00:27:05,515 --> 00:27:07,848
No, I'm not giving 'em
back to you.

480
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,481
That is bullshit.

481
00:27:09,483 --> 00:27:11,647
- Yes.
- Oh, wait. Excuse me.

482
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:13,614
- Those aren't for you.
- Take those.

483
00:27:13,616 --> 00:27:15,482
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

484
00:27:15,484 --> 00:27:17,882
Erica fucking Thompson?

485
00:27:17,884 --> 00:27:20,483
Mercedes, hi.

486
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:21,616
What are you doing here?

487
00:27:21,618 --> 00:27:23,649
Uh, didn't you, like,
go to California or something,

488
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:26,550
and, like, you were gonna,
like, make it?

489
00:27:26,552 --> 00:27:27,784
Well, I did.

490
00:27:27,786 --> 00:27:30,517
I got married,
I moved to California,

491
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,818
and my marriage didn't make it.

492
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,384
I understand
yours didn't, either.

493
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:37,384
Fuck no, right? No, thank God.

494
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:38,586
I'm so happy.

495
00:27:38,588 --> 00:27:40,452
- Look who's here. Hey.
- Oh.

496
00:27:40,454 --> 00:27:42,352
- It's Erica Thompson.
- Hi, Ben.

497
00:27:42,354 --> 00:27:44,487
- It's fucking Erica Thompson.
- Oh, hey.

498
00:27:44,489 --> 00:27:46,420
- You look nice.
- You, too.

499
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:48,589
You're not working here,
are you?

500
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,387
No, I just want
to wear this every day

501
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:54,521
and-and, um, help the bar out.

502
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:56,789
Can I please have
the two glasses back?

503
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:57,922
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

504
00:27:57,924 --> 00:28:00,689
You, like, left, and then
you had to come back here?

505
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:01,723
That is so sad.

506
00:28:01,725 --> 00:28:03,356
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God, no...

507
00:28:03,358 --> 00:28:04,690
Um, I'm gonna need you
to leave, please.

508
00:28:04,692 --> 00:28:06,090
Hey, don't you fucking
touch me, Mario.

509
00:28:06,092 --> 00:28:08,091
- No.
- If you don't get her out, I will. Come on.

510
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:09,158
- No, I'll take that.
- Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

511
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,758
- All right. Okay. Hey, Mercedes.
- Oh, oh, okay.

512
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,390
- Hey, hey, let go of me.
- Mercedes, come on.

513
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:13,390
You're not drinking anymore.

514
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:14,458
- I'm gonna have that.
- Come on, let's just...

515
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,092
- Mercedes, come on.
- Yeah, you left

516
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,692
- my fucking bag on the table.
- Come on.

517
00:28:18,694 --> 00:28:19,793
- Come on, Mercedes.
- Thanks for taking my drink.

518
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:21,392
- Come on. Come on. Come on, please go.
- Fuck off.

519
00:28:21,394 --> 00:28:22,426
Come on, guys.

520
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:23,860
Nice seeing you, Erica.

521
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:25,426
I'll see you.

522
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,529
I think I got
everything I need.

523
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:40,763
Oh, hi, Stu.

524
00:28:40,765 --> 00:28:42,662
- Hi. Oh, hi.
- Meet Maggie.

525
00:28:42,664 --> 00:28:44,463
- Hi. Hi.
- Stu is who I work with,

526
00:28:44,465 --> 00:28:45,897
- and we're doing the seminar.
- So nice to meet you.

527
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:47,897
- You, too.
- Hello.

528
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:49,630
Oh, Mom, you look great.

529
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:51,798
Oh, thanks.
I never know how dressy to get

530
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,664
with this training crap.

531
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:54,798
Well, you have a skirt,
though, right?

532
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,799
- I think so.
- Okay.

533
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:59,365
Honey, so I left you $80 here

534
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:02,333
- and a couple delivery takeout menus.
- Okay.

535
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:04,867
On the fridge is
the number for my hotel.

536
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:05,867
- Okay.
- Hey.

537
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,768
No one is coming over
while I'm gone, okay?

538
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,901
- I know. I won't.
- Seriously.

539
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:12,400
I'm trusting you.

540
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:13,668
You are gonna be fine.

541
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,869
- Thank you, honey.
- Love you.

542
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,671
I don't know.
I don't think I can.

543
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:38,672
Dude, your mom is, like,
ten states away.

544
00:29:38,674 --> 00:29:40,906
You're not gonna invite
your new best friends over?

545
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:42,906
That's fine. That's fine.
I'm not offended.

546
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:44,673
- It's okay.
- I totally would, seriously,

547
00:29:44,675 --> 00:29:46,406
but we're not even
unpacked yet.

548
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:47,840
There's, like, nothing to do,
like, at all.

549
00:29:47,842 --> 00:29:50,374
- Yo, what the fuck?
- What is it?

550
00:29:50,376 --> 00:29:51,808
- I am... I'm not touching it.
- Yo.

551
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,541
What if that's a bomb, bro?

552
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:55,476
- That would suck so hard.
- Fucking suck.

553
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:58,809
"Love, Ma"?

554
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:01,710
What?

555
00:30:03,578 --> 00:30:06,610
Hey. I was just thinking,
why wait for the weekend?

556
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:09,410
It's 5:00 somewhere.

557
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:13,544
- How did she get our numbers?
- Oh, my God.

558
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,945
Probably Haley. She gives it to
everyone when she's fucked up.

559
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,612
Eh, I can't argue with that.

560
00:30:17,614 --> 00:30:19,411
Yes, yes! Aah!

561
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:22,513
- Let's rage.
- Whoo!

562
00:30:22,515 --> 00:30:23,813
- Let's go!
- Okay, okay.

563
00:30:23,815 --> 00:30:25,446
To Ma's house we go.

564
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,947
Oh, get in. Get in.

565
00:30:33,817 --> 00:30:36,815
This is... better.

566
00:30:36,817 --> 00:30:38,549
This is way better.

567
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:40,551
Maggie, Andy, hey!

568
00:30:41,851 --> 00:30:43,817
- Can I get you something?
- Oh, uh...

569
00:30:43,819 --> 00:30:45,550
Got you some wings.

570
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,950
Oh, no, thanks, Sue Ann.
I'm good.

571
00:30:46,952 --> 00:30:50,651
Sue Ann? Oh, uh-uh.
Around here, you call me Ma.

572
00:30:50,653 --> 00:30:52,384
- Ooh.
- Oh.

573
00:30:52,386 --> 00:30:54,453
Okay.

574
00:30:57,687 --> 00:30:59,721
Mmm.

575
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:04,686
Oh, look at this place.

576
00:31:04,688 --> 00:31:08,387
Girl, look at you,
getting all fancy and shit.

577
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:09,387
Let's get filthy.

578
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:11,420
- Yes! Yes!
- Yeah?

579
00:31:11,422 --> 00:31:12,921
Hey. Hey.

580
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:15,555
- Hey!
- Welcome to Ma's.

581
00:31:15,557 --> 00:31:19,756
How you guys doing?
Looking good, handsome. Mmm.

582
00:31:19,758 --> 00:31:21,790
<i>Hey, do you think
we should, like, wake her?</i>

583
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:24,456
You know, she's been like that
since we got here.

584
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:27,457
No. That's Ashley,
and she's faking it.

585
00:31:27,459 --> 00:31:29,891
Her dad's a pastor,
so she comes to parties,

586
00:31:29,893 --> 00:31:31,825
pretends to be passed out
so she doesn't have to drink,

587
00:31:31,827 --> 00:31:33,825
and then she won't get
in trouble when she goes home.

588
00:31:33,827 --> 00:31:35,558
That might be the dumbest thing

589
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,424
I've ever heard
in my whole entire life.

590
00:31:37,426 --> 00:31:38,959
Yeah, no, no, no.
It's dumb as shit.

591
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:41,859
Guys, move that coffee table.
Let's get this party turned up!

592
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:50,128
Wind me up, Darrell!

593
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:02,406
- What are y'all up to over here?
- Hey.

594
00:33:02,408 --> 00:33:03,406
- How are y'all doing?
- Whoa.

595
00:33:03,408 --> 00:33:04,540
- Good.
- Good.

596
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:05,940
- You already started drinking without me?
- You good?

597
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,741
- Yeah. Catch up.
- Come on, now. Come on, now.

598
00:33:07,743 --> 00:33:09,374
Party doesn't start without me.

599
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,674
Watch this.

600
00:33:11,676 --> 00:33:13,374
Hey, Sue Ann.

601
00:33:13,376 --> 00:33:14,575
Hi.

602
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:15,708
Oh. Thank you.

603
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,142
Why are you sitting down?

604
00:33:17,144 --> 00:33:18,775
Why aren't you up
dancing with everyone?

605
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:21,943
Um... well, I guess
I was waiting on you.

606
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:23,776
Oh, okay.
So you're not...

607
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:25,911
you don't go
to a lot of parties?

608
00:33:25,913 --> 00:33:28,577
Oh. No, no, no,
I-I go to a lot of them.

609
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:30,477
Oh, no, it's...
no, it's-it's fine.

610
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:33,613
There's a first time
for everything. Absolutely.

611
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,514
I like your hair.

612
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:41,846
Thanks.
I like yours.

613
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:43,749
Really? Thank you.

614
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,715
Here you go.
Come on, Ashley.

615
00:33:56,717 --> 00:33:58,549
One's not gonna kill you.

616
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:02,652
Ow. Can you help me?

617
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,318
Milk did that body good.

618
00:34:08,486 --> 00:34:10,151
Darrell.

619
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:15,585
I-I don't even want this.

620
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,585
Those earrings
are beautiful, Maggie.

621
00:34:18,587 --> 00:34:19,920
Oh. Thanks.

622
00:34:19,922 --> 00:34:21,686
My mom gave them to me.

623
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:23,820
I mean, well,
my dad gave them to my mom

624
00:34:23,822 --> 00:34:25,387
when they first started
going out,

625
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,854
and then she gave them to me.

626
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,455
I mean, they're broken up now,
but, you know.

627
00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:34,955
- You got a sweet mama, huh?
- Yeah.

628
00:34:34,957 --> 00:34:36,888
Yo, turn the music down.
Listen up!

629
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,489
Cheers!

630
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:40,589
<i>¡En fuego!</i>

631
00:34:40,591 --> 00:34:41,856
Ma, come here.
We're toasting you.

632
00:34:41,858 --> 00:34:43,723
- Do a shot.
- Ooh, I-I don't drink.

633
00:34:43,725 --> 00:34:45,590
I mean, the last time I did,

634
00:34:45,592 --> 00:34:47,557
you really don't want to know.

635
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,658
Boo...!

636
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,457
Ma.

637
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:52,791
Ma! Ma!

638
00:34:52,793 --> 00:34:55,492
Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma!

639
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:58,759
Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma!

640
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:01,560
Yeah!

641
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:04,860
- Come on, Ma.
- What was that?

642
00:35:04,862 --> 00:35:07,594
That old-ass ice machine.

643
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:09,394
Uh, crank up the music, honey.

644
00:35:09,396 --> 00:35:10,828
Who wants shots? Pour me another one.

645
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,494
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah!

646
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:30,597
I have to pee,
like, really bad.

647
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,932
- Like, right now.
- Okay.

648
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:34,865
Oh. Hi, Ashley.

649
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:37,766
- I see you've slept it off.
- Very funny, Haley.

650
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,499
I think Kinsey and Dustin
are fucking in there.

651
00:35:42,501 --> 00:35:44,600
Let's go find another bathroom.

652
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:45,900
- What?
- Come on.

653
00:35:45,902 --> 00:35:48,167
- No, we can't go up there.
- Shh!

654
00:35:48,169 --> 00:35:49,601
We'll ask nicely.

655
00:35:49,603 --> 00:35:51,601
Shh.

656
00:35:54,503 --> 00:35:56,635
Oh. Fuck.

657
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:59,370
Yep, that's creepy.

658
00:36:11,472 --> 00:36:13,740
You shouldn't have done that.

659
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:21,608
I told you.

660
00:36:24,175 --> 00:36:25,674
- Hey, hey, we have to go.
- What? Why?

661
00:36:25,676 --> 00:36:27,407
- No, no. We got to go.
- I'm not done.

662
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:28,907
- I don't care. Just finish.
- Okay, okay, hang on. Hang on.

663
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:30,473
- What's going on?
- We have to go.

664
00:36:30,475 --> 00:36:31,741
- No, don't flush!
- Why?

665
00:36:31,743 --> 00:36:34,343
- She'll hear. Just get out.
- Okay. Shh. Shh.

666
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,876
- Whoa! Christ, Ma!
- What the hell?!

667
00:36:39,878 --> 00:36:43,510
What the fuck are y'all doing,
huh?! Get back downstairs!

668
00:36:47,012 --> 00:36:48,877
What's happening?

669
00:36:48,879 --> 00:36:50,878
Can we please just
get out of here?

670
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,477
Oh, my God.

671
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:55,779

what happened, really.

Chaz says I should still
sue her, though.

686
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:14,825
Hey.

687
00:38:14,827 --> 00:38:16,658
So, do you think
that she'd let us throw

688
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,025
a birthday party
at her house this weekend?

689
00:38:18,027 --> 00:38:19,993
I heard she lets you do
basically anything.

690
00:38:19,995 --> 00:38:21,060
I'm sure she'd be down.
You just, like,

691
00:38:21,062 --> 00:38:23,459
give her a list of stuff,
and she'll hook it up.

692
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:24,759
- That's crazy.
- Yeah, it's kind of cool.

693

Oh, my God.
I love your bracelet.

00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,027
Where did you get it?

695
00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:29,794
Taylor gave it to me
for our five-month.

696
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:32,628
- Aw.
- So I finally let him go down on me.

697
00:38:35,197 --> 00:38:37,497
Wait, how did you wait
five months?

698
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:43,197
Hey. What's up?

699
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:47,866
Um, do you want
to go out with me?

700
00:38:48,899 --> 00:38:50,431
Yeah.

701
00:38:50,433 --> 00:38:51,931
- Okay, that's great. Great.
- Yeah.

702
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:53,631
I don't know why
I was so nervous.

703
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:55,665
I-I was gonna text you first,
but then I was like,

704
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,765
"Oh, I should ask
old-school," and...

705
00:38:57,767 --> 00:38:59,199
That's cute.

706
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:02,000
Wait. Like, on a date
or, like, like a couple?

707
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:05,902
Both.

708
00:39:06,902 --> 00:39:07,901
Okay.

709
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:11,500
So, why did it take you
so long to ask me out?

710
00:39:11,502 --> 00:39:13,468
I so obviously like you.

711
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,735
Yeah, 'cause I was actually
talking to this other girl.

712
00:39:14,737 --> 00:39:15,735
- Oh, really? This other girl?
- And so I was deciding, like,

713
00:39:15,737 --> 00:39:17,702
- who do I... who do I...
- What's up, lovebirds?

714
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:19,736
- I love you guys!
- Aah! Oh, my God.

715
00:39:19,738 --> 00:39:21,203
Either she said yes,
or you're holding her

716
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:22,803
- against her will.
- Shut up, dude.

717
00:39:22,805 --> 00:39:24,970
Ah, I love love, bro.
Don't you love love?

718
00:39:24,972 --> 00:39:26,904
I friggin' adore love.

719
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:27,971
Hey, guys, guys,
if you get pregnant,

720
00:39:27,973 --> 00:39:29,704
- can you name it Chaz? Please?
- Oh, no.

721
00:39:29,706 --> 00:39:31,872
Oh, my God!
Are we going for pizza or what?

722
00:39:31,874 --> 00:39:33,972
Hell yeah!
I got nine bucks, bitch!

723
00:39:33,974 --> 00:39:35,840
Hey, guys.

724
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,706
Hi. Uh, what-what
are you doing here?

725
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:44,473
I got us a beer pong table,
and a keg of Bud Light

726
00:39:44,475 --> 00:39:46,773
is on ice if y'all are all down to clown.

727
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:49,040
I can't tonight. I have to write about

728
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:51,507
historical shipping routes
of Africa, so...

729
00:39:51,509 --> 00:39:53,507
Yeah, all those ships
with our people in the belly.

730
00:39:53,509 --> 00:39:54,910
Ain't that right, Sue Ann?

731
00:39:58,577 --> 00:40:00,542
What about the rest
of you guys?

732
00:40:00,544 --> 00:40:03,043
Um... Sorry, Ma, I can't.

733
00:40:03,045 --> 00:40:05,210
School night's hard for me.

734
00:40:05,212 --> 00:40:07,711
Well, who needs y'all?

735
00:40:07,713 --> 00:40:11,744
Girls, girls, you guys want to
party like rock stars, or what?

736
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:13,912
No, I got to clean the
house before my mom gets home.

737
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,545
Hey, maybe next time.

738
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:16,947
Damn, Ma.
Don't you got a job?

739
00:40:18,714 --> 00:40:20,880
Yeah, I guess
I should work a double

740
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:22,779
since you guys
don't have time for me.

741
00:40:22,781 --> 00:40:25,647
Girl, you need a man.

742
00:40:25,649 --> 00:40:28,549
Girl, you need
to watch your mouth.

743
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:40,883
Okay, bye.

744
00:40:40,885 --> 00:40:42,618
So weird.

745
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Here you go.
- All right. Thanks, Ma.
You need to follow me.

746
00:41:13,991 --> 00:41:16,488
Hey, Ma!

747
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,924
Loser!

748
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,758
<i>The hotel is amazing,</i>

749
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,993
and my instructor said
that my card technique

750
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,226
was the best of the bunch.

751
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:42,659
And then Stu thinks we'll be
actually dealing at the table

752
00:41:42,661 --> 00:41:44,526
in about two months.

753
00:41:44,528 --> 00:41:46,629
- That's exciting.
- Yeah.

754
00:41:48,629 --> 00:41:50,628
I'm sorry
I've been gone so much.

755
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,794
No, it's okay.

756
00:41:51,796 --> 00:41:53,661
I know you're working hard

757
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,595
and someone's got to
pay the bills, right?

758
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:56,762
That's sweet.

759
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,062
How was school?

760
00:42:01,598 --> 00:42:02,930
School was good.

761
00:42:02,932 --> 00:42:05,463
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

762
00:42:05,465 --> 00:42:07,697
What are you not saying?

763
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:08,998
Andy asked me out.

764
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,564
He asked you out?

765
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:14,765
Who's Andy?
And what did you say?

766
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:16,965
Oh, my God, he's so cute, Mom.
I said yes.

767
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,733
Well, I got to meet this Andy.

768
00:42:19,735 --> 00:42:21,499
Maybe next week.

769
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:23,532
We're going out tomorrow night,
if that's cool.

770
00:42:23,534 --> 00:42:24,967
Yeah. Okay.

771
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:26,934
I think it's super cool.

772
00:42:28,569 --> 00:42:30,533
You have a boyfriend.

773
00:42:30,535 --> 00:42:32,534
I mean, I-I guess.

774
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,007
Pow.

775
00:43:00,707 --> 00:43:02,541
Whoa!

776
00:43:16,477 --> 00:43:17,808
We won't stay long, I promise.

777
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,076
Tell Stephanie
"happy birthday,"

778
00:43:19,078 --> 00:43:20,676
and then we're
getting out of here.

779
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:24,243
It's my birthday!

780
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:27,610
Who are all these people?

781
00:43:27,612 --> 00:43:28,877
Probably from other schools.

782
00:43:28,879 --> 00:43:31,544
Hey!

783
00:43:31,546 --> 00:43:32,678
- Finally made it.
- Hey.

784
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,811
Everyone is here.

785
00:43:33,813 --> 00:43:36,778
Yeah. Well, it really is a great party.

786
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,879
- Hey, let me get you a drink. Okay?
- Ah, yeah.

787
00:43:38,881 --> 00:43:40,646
Something sweet.

788
00:43:43,082 --> 00:43:45,813
- He's a cutie.
- Yeah, he is.

789
00:43:45,815 --> 00:43:49,581
You be careful now.
Take it real slow.

790
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:50,714
Men are dogs.

791
00:43:50,716 --> 00:43:52,547
They only want one thing,

792
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:54,681
and you don't want to mess
your life up with a baby.

793
00:43:54,683 --> 00:43:56,782
Jesus, you sound
like my mother.

794
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:05,083
- Hey.
- Hey.

795
00:44:19,788 --> 00:44:21,653
- Oh, yeah. That was, that was great.
- Yeah.

796
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:22,686
Oh, I was gonna ask you.

797
00:44:22,688 --> 00:44:25,054
Oh, God.
No, that was perfect.

798
00:44:25,056 --> 00:44:26,754
Did you know my van's
actually parked...

799
00:44:26,756 --> 00:44:28,754
Let's do some shots, everybody.

800
00:44:28,756 --> 00:44:31,988
Come on, birthday girl.
Get your shot.

801
00:44:34,924 --> 00:44:37,656
Maggie, do mine for me.

802
00:44:37,658 --> 00:44:38,989
- You know I can't keep up.
- Uh, I don't know.

803
00:44:38,991 --> 00:44:40,789
If I do more than one,
I'll be sick.

804
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:42,555
Don't be a loser, just do it.

805
00:44:42,557 --> 00:44:43,790
Come on, it's my birthday.
For me.

806
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:44,823
Okay.

807
00:44:44,825 --> 00:44:46,924
Okay, to Stephanie.

808
00:44:46,926 --> 00:44:48,991
Yeah!

809
00:44:48,993 --> 00:44:50,991
- Hey, what's up, dude?
- Oh, this is a good one.

810
00:44:50,993 --> 00:44:52,058
Yeah!

811
00:44:57,994 --> 00:44:59,560
Hey!

812
00:45:51,569 --> 00:45:53,501
Oh, what the hell?

813
00:45:59,604 --> 00:46:00,970
Oh.

814
00:46:00,972 --> 00:46:02,805
What the...?

815
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:07,572
Oh.

816
00:46:08,906 --> 00:46:11,537
I remember...

817
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:14,872
going to the party,
and then I woke up.

818
00:46:14,874 --> 00:46:17,505
Don't remember
getting h... home.

819
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:18,806
Oh, God, what did I do?

820
00:46:18,808 --> 00:46:21,739
You got really sloppy,
like, really quick.

821
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:23,706
You were falling
all over the place.

822
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:25,041
Flashed Chaz your tits.

823
00:46:25,043 --> 00:46:26,840
No. No!

824
00:46:26,842 --> 00:46:28,507
Oh, I'm sorry.

825
00:46:28,509 --> 00:46:29,974
No, it's okay.
I got you out of there

826
00:46:29,976 --> 00:46:32,574
before anyone really noticed,
so it's not a big deal.

827
00:46:32,576 --> 00:46:33,977
Oh, my God, no.

828
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:36,909
Oh, my God.
I'm fucking with you.

829
00:46:36,911 --> 00:46:37,842
Seriously, you're fine. You...

830
00:46:37,844 --> 00:46:40,678
Oh, you're such an asshole.

831
00:46:45,812 --> 00:46:46,977
What's wrong?

832
00:46:46,979 --> 00:46:49,078
I don't want to hang out
at Ma's anymore.

833
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,111
And I don't want
you there, either.

834
00:46:51,113 --> 00:46:54,546
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

835
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,781
Why?

836
00:46:58,781 --> 00:47:00,714
Okay, I won't.

837
00:47:02,882 --> 00:47:05,813
But now you have to go
get egg rolls with me.

838
00:47:05,815 --> 00:47:08,580
- Okay.
- I'm gonna put ketchup on them.

839
00:47:08,582 --> 00:47:09,983
Okay.

840
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:38,986
Oh, shit.

841
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:40,986
- What?
- She's home. She's home.

842
00:47:40,988 --> 00:47:43,753
All right.
Um, uh, get in the chair.

843
00:47:43,755 --> 00:47:45,755
Just... sit down.
I don't know.

844
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,522
Hey!

845
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:57,024
Hey, Mags.

846
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:02,990
There's a boy in my house.

847
00:48:02,992 --> 00:48:04,656
Do you know him?

848
00:48:04,658 --> 00:48:06,123
Shit.

849
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:08,926
Hi, Mrs. Thompson.
I'm... Andy. Nice to meet you.

850
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,958
Nice to finally meet you, Andy.

851
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,894
How was work?

852
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:17,825
It was busy.

853
00:48:17,827 --> 00:48:19,628
Mm-hmm.

854
00:48:22,095 --> 00:48:24,461
You two thirsty?

855
00:48:28,029 --> 00:48:30,695
You cooking?

856
00:48:30,697 --> 00:48:32,861
Cheesesteaks.

857
00:48:32,863 --> 00:48:36,295
- Do you want one?
- No, I'm good.

858
00:48:36,297 --> 00:48:39,063
Have a seat, Andy.

859
00:48:39,065 --> 00:48:41,063
My mom passed away
five years ago.

860
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:42,997
And my dad owns
an armored vehicle company,

861
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:45,596
so they transport stuff
for, like,

862
00:48:45,598 --> 00:48:47,297
museums and banks
and that kind of thing.

863
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,131
Is your dad Ben Hawkins?

864
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:51,931
- Yeah.
- We went to high school together.

865
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:56,799
I didn't know about your mom.
I'm so sorry.

866
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:57,999
That's okay.

867
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,598
Dad's got a new fuck buddy now.

868
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,833
Uh, sorry.

869
00:49:01,835 --> 00:49:03,566
- Mercedes?
- Yeah.

870
00:49:03,568 --> 00:49:04,866
Yeah.

871
00:49:04,868 --> 00:49:06,769
How do we like her?

872
00:49:08,003 --> 00:49:09,834
Let's just say
I'm more of a...

873
00:49:09,836 --> 00:49:11,101
Porsche kind of guy.

874
00:49:11,103 --> 00:49:12,802
Mm.

875
00:49:12,804 --> 00:49:14,902
- Yeah, she's a bitch.
- All right.

876
00:49:14,904 --> 00:49:17,935
- Sorry.
- Do you want some more to drink, guys?

877
00:49:17,937 --> 00:49:20,003
I'm okay, thanks.

878
00:49:24,872 --> 00:49:26,870
You're really
blowing up there, kid.

879
00:49:26,872 --> 00:49:28,737
Mom.

880
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:31,074
- You got a lot of girlfriends, Andy?
- Stop.

881
00:49:40,008 --> 00:49:41,839
- Oh, just block her.
- Jesus Christ.

882
00:49:41,841 --> 00:49:42,940
I did.

883
00:49:42,942 --> 00:49:44,940
Yeah, Andy had to as well.

884
00:49:44,942 --> 00:49:46,840
I feel bad.

885
00:49:46,842 --> 00:49:48,941
Don't. Who cares?

886
00:49:48,943 --> 00:49:51,641
You know what? I'm gonna
tell everyone else, too.

887
00:49:56,011 --> 00:49:58,942
All right, listen up, bitches.

888
00:49:58,944 --> 00:50:00,810
Everybody block Ma for good.

889
00:50:00,812 --> 00:50:03,876
I'm serious.
That bitch is crazy.

890
00:50:03,878 --> 00:50:05,710
Look, my grandmother
is very sweet.

891
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:07,544
We'll see if we can,
like, hang out

892
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,013
in her lame-ass house
instead. Okay?

893
00:50:10,013 --> 00:50:12,611
Do you mind?

894
00:50:12,613 --> 00:50:14,979
How about you mind
your own damn business!

895
00:50:14,981 --> 00:50:16,912
You're making
your business my business.

896
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:18,813
Not today, old lady!
Not today!

897
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,581
You bitch.

898
00:50:21,781 --> 00:50:23,548
Here, Donna.

899
00:50:24,882 --> 00:50:26,615
Shit.

900
00:50:28,882 --> 00:50:30,616
Move!

901
00:50:32,117 --> 00:50:33,881
Listen up, bitches.

902
00:50:33,883 --> 00:50:36,882
Everybody block Ma for good.

903
00:50:36,884 --> 00:50:39,882
I'm serious.
That bitch is crazy.

904
00:50:39,884 --> 00:50:42,583
Look, my grandmother
is very sweet.

905
00:50:42,585 --> 00:50:44,150
We'll see if we can,
like, hang out

906
00:50:44,152 --> 00:50:47,017
in her lame-ass house
instead. Okay?

907
00:50:47,019 --> 00:50:49,684
Sue Ann!

908
00:50:49,686 --> 00:50:52,018
Have you fed the animals?

909
00:51:10,923 --> 00:51:12,991
Hello?

910
00:51:14,623 --> 00:51:17,523
Over here. Close the door.

911
00:51:40,995 --> 00:51:42,793
Hey, this is Ma.

912
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:45,094
I got a new number!

913
00:51:45,096 --> 00:51:47,560
Just picking up a few things.

914
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,861
Don't make me drink alone.
And I don't want to hear

915
00:51:49,863 --> 00:51:51,861
any of this
"I have homework" crap.

916
00:51:51,863 --> 00:51:53,128
Don't make me drink alone.

917
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,962
♪ Don't make me
drink alone ♪

918
00:51:54,964 --> 00:51:58,162
♪ Don't make me drink alone.

919
00:51:58,164 --> 00:52:00,730
Are you guys mad at me
for something?

920
00:52:00,732 --> 00:52:05,596
I mean, I, uh, risked my job
so that you could have fun,

921
00:52:05,598 --> 00:52:07,964
and we definitely did.

922
00:52:07,966 --> 00:52:11,597
The least you could do is,
you know, say thank you.

923
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,567
Hey, guys. It's Sue Ann.

924
00:52:15,767 --> 00:52:18,833
Look, I really need you
to meet me...

925
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,966
at the rock piles
after school tomorrow.

926
00:52:21,968 --> 00:52:24,033
It's an emergency.

927
00:52:24,035 --> 00:52:25,936
Please come.

928
00:52:40,604 --> 00:52:42,905
- What's up, guys?
- Hey.

929
00:52:45,638 --> 00:52:47,170
Hey.

930
00:52:47,172 --> 00:52:48,904
Oh.

931
00:52:48,906 --> 00:52:51,904
You guys are so sweet
to meet me out here.

932
00:52:51,906 --> 00:52:53,971
- What's the matter?
- Oh, it's...

933
00:52:53,973 --> 00:52:55,805
Sorry-sorry for the dramatics.

934
00:52:55,807 --> 00:52:57,774
It's just that, uh...

935
00:53:00,942 --> 00:53:03,773
I'm sick.

936
00:53:03,775 --> 00:53:05,806
What's wrong?

937
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:08,074
It's cancer.

938
00:53:08,076 --> 00:53:09,874
Pancreatic.

939
00:53:09,876 --> 00:53:12,775
And I've been taking
a lot of medicine lately.

940
00:53:12,777 --> 00:53:16,009
The doctors don't really know
how to treat it yet.

941
00:53:16,011 --> 00:53:19,076
And it's scary,
because the meds make me...

942
00:53:19,078 --> 00:53:23,676
less fun and-and not myself,
so I'm sorry.

943
00:53:23,678 --> 00:53:25,877
- Sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

944
00:53:25,879 --> 00:53:27,610
- Sorry.
- We had no idea.

945
00:53:27,612 --> 00:53:28,944
I know, honey, I know.

946
00:53:28,946 --> 00:53:31,012
I just... I try
to live my life privately.

947
00:53:31,014 --> 00:53:32,578
But I'm gonna beat this.

948
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,078
- Yeah.
- I could sure use

949
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,779
some friends, though.

950
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:38,746
I'm gonna beat this, right?

951
00:53:40,115 --> 00:53:41,981
Okay.

952
00:53:43,016 --> 00:53:44,648
Oh, sweetie.

953
00:53:45,982 --> 00:53:47,980
I got to go back to work.

954
00:53:47,982 --> 00:53:51,748
I just wanted to...
let you guys know.

955
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,115
You can beat it, Ma.

956
00:53:53,117 --> 00:53:56,648
My granddad did,
and he's a fucking pussy, so...

957
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,749
Yeah, Ma.

958
00:53:58,751 --> 00:54:00,349
- Stay strong.
- Thanks.

959
00:54:00,351 --> 00:54:03,183
And, uh, if you have time

960
00:54:03,185 --> 00:54:06,650
or you want to come over
on Saturday...

961
00:54:06,652 --> 00:54:08,650
No pressure, though.

962
00:54:08,652 --> 00:54:10,552
No pressure.

963
00:54:13,887 --> 00:54:16,618
Well, fuck me in the butt.

964
00:54:27,689 --> 00:54:29,754
Come with me.

965
00:54:29,756 --> 00:54:31,855
Come on. Goddamn, Rosco,
bring your ass...

966
00:54:31,857 --> 00:54:33,721
Oh, shit!

967
00:54:33,723 --> 00:54:35,955
Come on.

968
00:54:35,957 --> 00:54:37,589
She was wearing
Stephanie's bracelet.

969
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:38,822
You didn't notice?

970
00:54:38,824 --> 00:54:40,156
- Really?
- Yeah.

971
00:54:40,158 --> 00:54:42,957
Get your ass
in this motherfucking trailer.

972
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:44,957
I've been missing
my grandma's ring,

973
00:54:44,959 --> 00:54:47,923
and my mom is gonna fucking
kill me if I don't find it.

974
00:54:47,925 --> 00:54:49,158
And I bet she has it.

975
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,993
You know, I'm missing
the earrings my mom gave me.

976
00:54:54,794 --> 00:54:56,658
We're going
to that bitch's house.

977
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,925
Hey. Hey!
What if somebody sees us?

978
00:54:59,927 --> 00:55:03,062
We're in bum-fuck, dumbass.
Nobody's gonna see us.

979
00:55:04,895 --> 00:55:06,594
- Oh, shit.
- Haley? Haley?

980
00:55:06,596 --> 00:55:07,927
Let's go, okay?
I'm serious.

981
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,896
No. I know she has
my grandma's ring.

982
00:55:11,063 --> 00:55:12,895
Don't be such a pussy.
Let's go.

983
00:55:15,131 --> 00:55:18,664
Wow, this is...
really graceful.

984
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,930
Maggie.

985
00:55:29,932 --> 00:55:31,700
Ugh.

986
00:55:39,934 --> 00:55:42,733
What the hell?

987
00:55:42,735 --> 00:55:44,935
What?

988
00:56:06,806 --> 00:56:09,071
Yeah.

989
00:56:10,973 --> 00:56:13,938
Whoa.

990
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,805
Cool it with the pics, Ma.

991
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:34,977
This is so creepy.

992
00:56:40,778 --> 00:56:41,776
Sue Ann?

993
00:56:41,778 --> 00:56:43,910
Ben.

994
00:56:43,912 --> 00:56:45,943
I didn't know you worked here.

995
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:48,077
How are you? How you been?

996
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,878
I'm-I'm good.

997
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,677
Yeah, I'm-I'm good.

998
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:53,844
Well, uh,
this old guy needs his shots.

999
00:56:53,846 --> 00:56:56,179
Our vet moved to Florida
in December,

1000
00:56:56,181 --> 00:56:58,678
so we're looking
for a new spot.

1001
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,079
Well...

1002
00:57:00,081 --> 00:57:02,715
we can certainly do that.

1003
00:57:05,681 --> 00:57:06,881
Well, it's good to see you.
You look great.

1004
00:57:06,883 --> 00:57:09,081
How long has it been, huh?

1005
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:10,114
15 years?

1006
00:57:10,116 --> 00:57:11,947
- 20?
- Something like that.

1007
00:57:11,949 --> 00:57:13,948
That makes me feel old.

1008
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:15,215
I don't like it.

1009
00:57:15,217 --> 00:57:17,082
Me, neither.
I feel it every day.

1010
00:57:17,084 --> 00:57:19,682
Oh, just-just sign it.
I'll do the rest.

1011
00:57:19,684 --> 00:57:20,916
Sure.

1012
00:57:24,652 --> 00:57:26,683
Well, it's good to see you.

1013
00:57:26,685 --> 00:57:28,750
We should catch up sometime.

1014
00:57:28,752 --> 00:57:30,084
Really?

1015
00:57:30,086 --> 00:57:32,785
I-I...

1016
00:57:32,787 --> 00:57:34,185
I'd like that.

1017
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:40,752
- You know Magill's Pub?
- Yeah.

1018
00:57:40,754 --> 00:57:41,986
I'll come back after work,
pick him up,

1019
00:57:41,988 --> 00:57:42,853
and we can go right there.

1020
00:57:42,855 --> 00:57:45,686
I-I wouldn't want to go
in my scrubs.

1021
00:57:45,688 --> 00:57:48,020
How about I meet you there
at 6:00?

1022
00:57:48,022 --> 00:57:49,821
All right.

1023
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,988
Hello?

1024
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1025
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:19,959
Uh, Maggie?

1026
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:21,193
What?

1027
00:58:21,195 --> 00:58:23,793
You might want to,
um, take a...

1028
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:25,627
Oh, my God!

1029
00:58:30,063 --> 00:58:32,064
What are you guys
doing in here?

1030
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:38,029
It's okay. I don't mind.

1031
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:40,729
Uh, what are you doing here?

1032
00:58:40,731 --> 00:58:42,630
I live here.
This is my house.

1033
00:58:42,632 --> 00:58:44,830
Uh, you can walk?

1034
00:58:44,832 --> 00:58:47,097
- I mean, I thought that...
- I'm not supposed to.

1035
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:49,731
- I'm sick.
- Uh, sorry.

1036
00:58:49,733 --> 00:58:51,067
What's happening?

1037
00:58:52,067 --> 00:58:53,831
Uh, do you know Haley?

1038
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:55,099
Haley, this is...

1039
00:58:55,101 --> 00:58:56,999
Genie. Genie, right?

1040
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:59,399
Yeah, we were here,
uh, last week,

1041
00:58:59,401 --> 00:59:01,033
and I left my school I.D.

1042
00:59:01,035 --> 00:59:03,033
I need it for the PSATs.

1043
00:59:03,035 --> 00:59:04,900
Hi, Genie.

1044
00:59:04,902 --> 00:59:07,001
Hi.

1045
00:59:07,003 --> 00:59:09,003
You have pretty teeth.

1046
00:59:10,769 --> 00:59:12,835
Uh, that's-that's
very sweet of you.

1047
00:59:12,837 --> 00:59:14,768
I haven't seen you

1048
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:15,968
at school in, like, forever.

1049
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,203
Yeah, my mom, sh...

1050
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:20,936
I get sick a lot, and my mom
thought it would be better

1051
00:59:20,938 --> 00:59:22,170
if I stay home for a while.

1052
00:59:22,172 --> 00:59:24,171
- Oh.
- My mom says that the doctors say

1053
00:59:24,173 --> 00:59:26,139
it's my spine
and it's getting worse.

1054
00:59:27,672 --> 00:59:30,004
My mind is, like...
blown.

1055
00:59:30,006 --> 00:59:32,105
Um...

1056
00:59:32,107 --> 00:59:34,771
Ma is your m-mom?

1057
00:59:34,773 --> 00:59:38,741
- I'm sorry, uh, Sue Ann is your-your mom?
- Yeah.

1058
00:59:47,909 --> 00:59:51,108
I hear you guys downstairs
in the basement a lot.

1059
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:53,408
Is it fun?

1060
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:56,875
Uh... it can be.

1061
00:59:56,877 --> 00:59:58,877
You should come.

1062
01:00:04,678 --> 01:00:06,977
Y-You guys should leave.

1063
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:10,111
My mom doesn't like
when anybody's in her room.

1064
01:00:10,113 --> 01:00:12,678
It's better
not to get her upset.

1065
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,079
I won't tell her
you were here if you don't.

1066
01:00:14,081 --> 01:00:16,845
Oh, no, we're not saying shit.

1067
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:18,979
Maybe I'll see you at school?

1068
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:20,679
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

1069
01:00:20,681 --> 01:00:21,781
- Go ahead.
- Maybe.

1070
01:00:22,815 --> 01:00:24,582
Bye.

1071
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:39,916
- Shit.
- Go, go!

1072
01:00:39,918 --> 01:00:40,916
Get out of here!

1073
01:00:40,918 --> 01:00:42,917
Okay.

1074
01:00:48,753 --> 01:00:50,051
Genie!

1075
01:00:50,053 --> 01:00:51,918
Yes, Mama?

1076
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,918
You been down here
messing with these kitties?

1077
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,119
No, ma'am.

1078
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:58,121
Well, they've been moved!

1079
01:01:21,991 --> 01:01:24,193
Go.

1080
01:01:25,992 --> 01:01:27,757
You look pretty.

1081
01:01:27,759 --> 01:01:29,124
I'm going out.

1082
01:01:29,126 --> 01:01:30,724
It's time for your medicine.

1083
01:01:30,726 --> 01:01:33,092
I was wondering
if I can go back to school.

1084
01:01:33,094 --> 01:01:36,725
I'm feeling better,
and I miss my classes.

1085
01:01:36,727 --> 01:01:37,759
You're too sick.

1086
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:40,992
And these doctors,
they don't quite see it yet.

1087
01:01:40,994 --> 01:01:42,194
I know.

1088
01:01:42,196 --> 01:01:43,860
But maybe half a day
would work.

1089
01:01:43,862 --> 01:01:45,127
That way,
my teachers can grade

1090
01:01:45,129 --> 01:01:47,860
my homework
and you don't have to.

1091
01:01:47,862 --> 01:01:49,994
I can ride the bus.

1092
01:01:49,996 --> 01:01:52,763
You don't look well, baby.

1093
01:01:54,997 --> 01:01:58,096
And your hair is way too long.

1094
01:01:58,098 --> 01:02:00,097
So maybe we should just

1095
01:02:00,099 --> 01:02:03,896
cut it all off
before it all falls out.

1096
01:02:03,898 --> 01:02:06,664
The other kids
will make fun of you.

1097
01:02:06,666 --> 01:02:08,897
That's what they do.

1098
01:02:08,899 --> 01:02:11,098
That's why you have
to stay here with me,

1099
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,101
where it's safe.

1100
01:02:16,167 --> 01:02:17,733
Mommy loves you.

1101
01:02:37,771 --> 01:02:40,002
<i>It's your first time, isn't it?</i>

1102
01:02:40,004 --> 01:02:41,702
<i>Do you even know
what you're doing?</i>

1103
01:02:41,704 --> 01:02:43,237
No.

1104
01:02:43,239 --> 01:02:46,736
You're gonna get on your knees.

1105
01:02:46,738 --> 01:02:48,673
Put it in your mouth.

1106
01:02:50,673 --> 01:02:55,672
Move your head
backwards, forwards.

1107
01:02:55,674 --> 01:02:58,839
Believe me,
it won't take long.

1108
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:00,873
You look hot.

1109
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:03,142
- Thanks, Mercedes.
- Mm-hmm.

1110
01:03:04,675 --> 01:03:06,809
Pow, girl.

1111
01:03:12,777 --> 01:03:14,975
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1112
01:03:14,977 --> 01:03:17,842
Oh.
Don't even worry about it.

1113
01:03:17,844 --> 01:03:21,210
I got caught up at the office.

1114
01:03:21,212 --> 01:03:23,944
Well, you look lovely.

1115
01:03:23,946 --> 01:03:26,111
Oh, hey. How are you?

1116
01:03:26,113 --> 01:03:27,810
I'll have a Maker's, neat.

1117
01:03:27,812 --> 01:03:28,977
And Sue Ann?

1118
01:03:28,979 --> 01:03:31,744
Uh, uh, Diet Coke, please.

1119
01:03:31,746 --> 01:03:33,212
Are you really gonna
make me drink alone?

1120
01:03:33,214 --> 01:03:37,113
Oh, I am content to sit here
and watch you do your thing.

1121
01:03:37,115 --> 01:03:40,846
Hmm. Fair enough.

1122
01:03:40,848 --> 01:03:44,680
So, uh, you keep in touch
with anyone from school?

1123
01:03:44,682 --> 01:03:46,114
No, no.

1124
01:03:46,116 --> 01:03:49,014
I mean, I run into people
every now and then, but, uh,

1125
01:03:49,016 --> 01:03:52,215
I don't do reunions
or anything like that.

1126
01:03:52,217 --> 01:03:54,216
I went to the ten-year reunion.

1127
01:03:54,218 --> 01:03:56,915
After that, forget it.

1128
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:59,449
My wife hated
the entire experience.

1129
01:03:59,451 --> 01:04:01,450
I heard she passed away.

1130
01:04:01,452 --> 01:04:03,016
I'm sorry to hear that.

1131
01:04:03,018 --> 01:04:06,017
Yeah. Cancer got her.

1132
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:07,451
What are you gonna do.

1133
01:04:07,453 --> 01:04:11,151
Yeah. I was, uh,
married years ago.

1134
01:04:11,153 --> 01:04:13,885
But... it didn't work out.

1135
01:04:13,887 --> 01:04:16,918
Sometimes you want something
so badly,

1136
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,886
and then suddenly you just...

1137
01:04:19,888 --> 01:04:21,888
don't.

1138
01:04:30,823 --> 01:04:33,855
Do you know what this is?

1139
01:04:33,857 --> 01:04:35,754
What is that, a Taser?

1140
01:04:35,756 --> 01:04:39,189
You gonna tase me for drinking
a Diet Coke, Ben?

1141
01:04:39,191 --> 01:04:41,755
It's a personal
tracking device.

1142
01:04:41,757 --> 01:04:42,890
Okay.

1143
01:04:42,892 --> 01:04:44,124
I have these devices

1144
01:04:44,126 --> 01:04:46,756
on my entire fleet
of trucks and vans,

1145
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:49,458
including my son Andrew's van.

1146
01:04:51,793 --> 01:04:55,660
Why the fuck is my son
spending time at your house?

1147
01:04:56,694 --> 01:04:58,692
You need to talk to him.

1148
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:01,761
Well, I'm talking to you,
right now.

1149
01:05:03,262 --> 01:05:06,094
I don't know what you want me
to say, Ben.

1150
01:05:06,096 --> 01:05:09,994
C-Could we please
not do this here?

1151
01:05:09,996 --> 01:05:13,862
Well, here's what I think.

1152
01:05:13,864 --> 01:05:16,195
I think you're trying
to get back at me.

1153
01:05:16,197 --> 01:05:18,029
Come on.

1154
01:05:18,031 --> 01:05:20,263
We both know
you had a thing for me,

1155
01:05:20,265 --> 01:05:24,030
and I barely gave you
the time of day.

1156
01:05:24,032 --> 01:05:26,030
You're a loser, Sue Ann.

1157
01:05:26,032 --> 01:05:28,133
You always have been,
and it's pathetic.

1158
01:05:29,933 --> 01:05:33,931
Some people
just don't change, do they?

1159
01:05:33,933 --> 01:05:37,166
No. They don't.

1160
01:05:37,168 --> 01:05:40,732
This is your one warning,
Sue Ann.

1161
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:44,467
And if I hear that my son
has ended up anywhere near you

1162
01:05:44,469 --> 01:05:48,268
or your damn house,
I won't be calling the police.

1163
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:50,801
I'll handle it myself.

1164
01:05:50,803 --> 01:05:53,769
You understand me?

1165
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,472
Sue Ann,
put down the damn phone.

1166
01:06:14,474 --> 01:06:15,940
Get the clippers
and shave this fella.

1167
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:35,175
Genie is Ma's daughter,
and she never told us.

1168
01:06:35,177 --> 01:06:36,876
Okay? She can walk.

1169
01:06:36,878 --> 01:06:38,276
And she's been in that house

1170
01:06:38,278 --> 01:06:39,976
the whole time
we've been there.

1171
01:06:39,978 --> 01:06:41,977
Ma went to high school
with our parents.

1172
01:06:41,979 --> 01:06:44,244
Like, she tore out pages
from her yearbook

1173
01:06:44,246 --> 01:06:47,110
and pasted herself
in pictures with your dad

1174
01:06:47,112 --> 01:06:49,278
and my mom and Mercedes.

1175
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,811
- I mean, it's so creepy!
- Who cares?

1176
01:06:50,813 --> 01:06:52,311
Pancreatic cancer's
some fucked-up shit.

1177
01:06:52,313 --> 01:06:55,312
All that medicine
makes you do some weird stuff.

1178
01:06:55,314 --> 01:06:57,812
You can't be serious.

1179
01:06:57,814 --> 01:07:00,880
My mom acted weird, too,
before she died.

1180
01:07:00,882 --> 01:07:02,915
Oh.

1181
01:07:05,816 --> 01:07:07,849
I'm sorry about your mom.

1182
01:07:09,716 --> 01:07:13,715
But I don't... I don't think
Sue Ann has cancer.

1183
01:07:13,717 --> 01:07:16,048
I think she used to be
in love with your dad,

1184
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:19,216
and I think she's, like,
in love with you now.

1185
01:07:19,218 --> 01:07:21,216
Well, duh.

1186
01:07:21,218 --> 01:07:23,250
Oh, my God.

1187
01:07:23,252 --> 01:07:25,251
- I'm kidding.
- You're totally into it.

1188
01:07:25,253 --> 01:07:27,251
I'm sort of kidding, yeah.

1189
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:29,251
Leaving,
that was the easy part.

1190
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:31,951
I didn't worry about that.
The move was hard.

1191
01:07:31,953 --> 01:07:35,185
Oh, I hear you
loud and clear with that one.

1192
01:07:35,187 --> 01:07:37,952
Right? And I just never realized

1193
01:07:37,954 --> 01:07:42,020
how much stuff I had
until I saw it all in boxes.

1194
01:07:42,022 --> 01:07:44,853
- Oh. Mm, mm, mm.
- So...

1195
01:07:44,855 --> 01:07:46,187
It was diffi...

1196
01:07:46,189 --> 01:07:47,754
Hi, honey!

1197
01:07:47,756 --> 01:07:49,054
I want you to meet someone.

1198
01:07:49,056 --> 01:07:50,821
This is Sue Ann.

1199
01:07:50,823 --> 01:07:52,787
Mags?

1200
01:07:52,789 --> 01:07:54,722
Maggie.

1201
01:07:54,724 --> 01:07:56,322
Nice to meet you, Maggie.

1202
01:07:56,324 --> 01:07:58,122
Nice to meet you, too.

1203
01:07:58,124 --> 01:08:01,323
She works at the vet
where we take Lou.

1204
01:08:01,325 --> 01:08:03,056
And then
she was just stopping in

1205
01:08:03,058 --> 01:08:05,056
to check on how he was doing.

1206
01:08:05,058 --> 01:08:06,957
Oh, just a friendly follow-up
to make sure

1207
01:08:06,959 --> 01:08:08,891
there wasn't a reaction
to the shots.

1208
01:08:08,893 --> 01:08:12,125
Here. Come. Sit down.

1209
01:08:12,127 --> 01:08:13,925
And guess what.

1210
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:17,025
We went to high school
together,

1211
01:08:17,027 --> 01:08:20,059
- with Ben and Mercedes.
- Huh.

1212
01:08:20,061 --> 01:08:23,260
Mm. So, uh, where do you go
to school, Maggie?

1213
01:08:23,262 --> 01:08:25,194
I go to Franklin.

1214
01:08:25,196 --> 01:08:28,727
I know how hard it can be
to make friends.

1215
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:30,895
Well, she's doing good.
She's made some great friends.

1216
01:08:30,897 --> 01:08:33,928
Really nice kids.
I'm proud of her.

1217
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:36,062
- Oh, shoot. Look at me.
- Oh.

1218
01:08:36,064 --> 01:08:38,062
Always running behind.

1219
01:08:38,064 --> 01:08:40,962
Sorry to just drop by
unannounced.

1220
01:08:40,964 --> 01:08:43,830
I just get so attached
to these animals so quickly.

1221
01:08:43,832 --> 01:08:45,164
- Oh.
- There's probably something wrong with me.

1222
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:46,164
Oh, please.

1223
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:48,064
Thank you so much.

1224
01:08:48,066 --> 01:08:50,498
Come by anytime.
You're welcome.

1225
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,065
It was so good to see you.

1226
01:08:54,067 --> 01:08:56,067
You, too.

1227
01:08:58,034 --> 01:08:59,900
And, Maggie,

1228
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:01,935
you look after that dog
for me, now.

1229
01:09:11,203 --> 01:09:13,068
<i>Don't stop.</i>

1230
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:15,302
<i>Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't.</i>

1231
01:09:21,272 --> 01:09:23,336
Was I... good?

1232
01:09:23,338 --> 01:09:26,271
Yeah.

1233
01:09:26,273 --> 01:09:30,005
Um, Ben, are you gonna talk
to me tomorrow?

1234
01:09:30,007 --> 01:09:33,071
Let's get out of here.

1235
01:09:33,073 --> 01:09:35,073
Okay.

1236
01:09:44,075 --> 01:09:45,907
Ben?

1237
01:09:45,909 --> 01:09:48,143
Surprise.

1238
01:09:51,177 --> 01:09:53,975
Oh, God.
That took forever.

1239
01:09:53,977 --> 01:09:55,209
So, how was she?

1240
01:09:55,211 --> 01:09:57,775
- Was she good?
- It was fucking awesome.

1241
01:10:21,282 --> 01:10:24,080
Fucking cunt.

1242
01:10:47,319 --> 01:10:49,686
Louie?

1243
01:10:52,253 --> 01:10:53,818
Louie?!

1244
01:10:55,087 --> 01:10:56,221
Louie!

1245
01:11:30,896 --> 01:11:33,161
Oh, my God. You're bleeding!

1246
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:46,099
Hello?

1247
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:15,135
His breathing's slow.

1248
01:12:15,137 --> 01:12:16,968
I don't think
we should move him.

1249
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:18,403
I'm gonna call Sue Ann,
and she...

1250
01:12:18,405 --> 01:12:20,103
Don't.

1251
01:12:20,105 --> 01:12:22,136
Don't call her.

1252
01:12:22,138 --> 01:12:23,972
Why?

1253
01:12:25,273 --> 01:12:27,273
What's the matter?

1254
01:12:29,172 --> 01:12:31,073
I know her.

1255
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,040
I've been to her house.

1256
01:12:41,609 --> 01:12:43,607
Well, look who it is.

1257
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,107
Enough!

1258
01:12:45,109 --> 01:12:46,173
I don't have time
for this shit.

1259
01:12:46,175 --> 01:12:47,274
Where's my son?

1260
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:49,275
Nobody's here
but you and me, Ben.

1261
01:12:49,277 --> 01:12:51,974
I know he's here.
Andrew, come out here!

1262
01:12:51,976 --> 01:12:55,075
Do you know what this is?

1263
01:12:55,077 --> 01:12:56,376
What?

1264
01:12:58,244 --> 01:12:59,943
Jesus Christ! You...

1265
01:13:11,013 --> 01:13:14,312
I am so disappointed in you.
What were you thinking?

1266
01:13:14,314 --> 01:13:15,911
Everyone kept going over there,

1267
01:13:15,913 --> 01:13:17,345
and I thought,
if I didn't want to,

1268
01:13:17,347 --> 01:13:19,413
they wouldn't want
to be friends with me anymore.

1269
01:13:19,415 --> 01:13:22,079
You are 16 years old.
Do you realize...

1270
01:13:22,081 --> 01:13:24,447
Sneaking booze
at prom is one thing.

1271
01:13:24,449 --> 01:13:27,047
But hanging around
in this fucking bitch's house

1272
01:13:27,049 --> 01:13:29,180
while she's feeding
everyone alcohol,

1273
01:13:29,182 --> 01:13:31,448
that is unacceptable!

1274
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,315
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling Andy's father,

1275
01:13:33,317 --> 01:13:35,015
- and he...
- No! Stop!

1276
01:13:35,017 --> 01:13:37,116
Please don't call him.
He had nothing to do with this.

1277
01:13:37,118 --> 01:13:38,982
He's the most innocent one
of all of us.

1278
01:13:38,984 --> 01:13:40,149
Please don't call him.

1279
01:13:40,151 --> 01:13:43,183
Go in your room.
Go to your room.

1280
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:46,183
Your ass is staying in
this house till summer break!

1281
01:13:46,185 --> 01:13:48,084
Period!
And you are never

1282
01:13:48,086 --> 01:13:49,318
stepping foot
in that woman's house!

1283
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,051
You're not going in Andy's van!

1284
01:13:51,053 --> 01:13:52,917
You're not going
wherever the fuck you think

1285
01:13:52,919 --> 01:13:54,388
you want to be going!

1286
01:14:00,222 --> 01:14:02,853
Surprise.

1287
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,053
Oh, don't worry.

1288
01:14:05,055 --> 01:14:06,987
I'll let Andy know
you'll be out late.

1289
01:14:09,922 --> 01:14:13,389
Ben, Ben, Ben.

1290
01:14:18,258 --> 01:14:21,123
You know...

1291
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:24,057
...I didn't know
what to do with you at first.

1292
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:25,857
Sue Ann, please.

1293
01:14:27,892 --> 01:14:31,058
What do we have here?

1294
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:33,292
Is this what you were gonna
show me in that closet?

1295
01:14:35,193 --> 01:14:37,259
Maybe I should cut it off.

1296
01:14:41,862 --> 01:14:42,926
Maybe not.

1297
01:14:47,429 --> 01:14:49,929
What you did to me...

1298
01:14:52,163 --> 01:14:54,164
...the humiliation...

1299
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:57,962
...it never goes away.

1300
01:14:57,964 --> 01:15:00,196
Please, Sue Ann.

1301
01:15:00,198 --> 01:15:03,096
But then it hit me.

1302
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:04,996
"Sue Ann,

1303
01:15:04,998 --> 01:15:07,097
you're thinking about this
the wrong way."

1304
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,997
You see,
you treated me like a dog,

1305
01:15:10,999 --> 01:15:13,067
because that's what you are.

1306
01:15:16,367 --> 01:15:18,932
You...

1307
01:15:18,934 --> 01:15:21,433
you're no man, Ben Hawkins.

1308
01:15:21,435 --> 01:15:23,199
What the fuck is that?

1309
01:15:28,869 --> 01:15:31,068
Please, Sue Ann.

1310
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:32,335
I was just a kid.

1311
01:15:32,337 --> 01:15:34,335
So was I, motherfucker.

1312
01:15:34,337 --> 01:15:35,335
No. No!

1313
01:15:37,371 --> 01:15:38,369
No, no, no.

1314
01:15:54,207 --> 01:15:56,306
Tomorrow's my day off.

1315
01:15:56,308 --> 01:15:59,341
You're getting up and
coming with me to run errands.

1316
01:16:01,342 --> 01:16:04,108
And your butt's in my car
at 8:00 a.m.

1317
01:16:06,009 --> 01:16:08,007
Bitch.

1318
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:13,941
Hey, Erica.

1319
01:16:13,943 --> 01:16:16,875
You ever come near my house
or my daughter again,

1320
01:16:16,877 --> 01:16:18,976
I'm calling the police.

1321
01:16:18,978 --> 01:16:21,376
What on earth
are you talking about?

1322
01:16:21,378 --> 01:16:24,411
What kind of mother
parties with high schoolers?

1323
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,943
I think you've had
a little too much coffee.

1324
01:16:26,945 --> 01:16:28,077
Excuse me.

1325
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:29,944
I'm not joking here.

1326
01:16:29,946 --> 01:16:31,312
Back the fuck off.

1327
01:16:31,314 --> 01:16:33,078
Oh, I know how to deal
with your type.

1328
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,978
Pretty, athletic, popular.

1329
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:38,212
But then you did move home to
sling cocktails at casinos...

1330
01:16:38,214 --> 01:16:39,346
They're children!

1331
01:16:39,348 --> 01:16:41,112
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1332
01:16:41,114 --> 01:16:43,946
How does it feel to be
on the outside looking in?

1333
01:16:43,948 --> 01:16:46,380
Hurts, huh?

1334
01:16:46,382 --> 01:16:48,881
Well, I can assure you

1335
01:16:48,883 --> 01:16:52,248
that the view from the center
is amazing.

1336
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,982
You need help.

1337
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:56,382
Sounds like someone's
a little jealous.

1338
01:16:56,384 --> 01:16:59,082
A little jealous of Sue Ann!

1339
01:16:59,084 --> 01:17:01,417
Think I thought we had
some kind of a connection,

1340
01:17:01,419 --> 01:17:03,150
but you just threw it all away.

1341
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:04,283
You threw it all away!

1342
01:17:04,285 --> 01:17:06,884
Ungrateful bitch.

1343
01:17:06,886 --> 01:17:08,852
To think I took care
of Mercedes for you.

1344
01:17:24,089 --> 01:17:26,087
Maggie,

1345
01:17:26,089 --> 01:17:28,020
you're missing out.

1346
01:17:28,022 --> 01:17:29,921
And look.

1347
01:17:29,923 --> 01:17:33,355
- Oh, look who I found.
- Are you fucking kidding?

1348
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:35,223
He's mine now.

1349
01:17:37,224 --> 01:17:39,156
Thanks for these earrings.

1350
01:17:39,158 --> 01:17:40,423
No.

1351
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:09,094
I don't know what Ma's deal is.

1352
01:18:09,096 --> 01:18:10,530
Yeah, she's weird, man.

1353
01:18:17,064 --> 01:18:18,496
Fuck it, birthday.

1354
01:18:21,098 --> 01:18:23,163
You fucking liar.

1355
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,963
You said you weren't gonna
hang out here anymore.

1356
01:18:24,965 --> 01:18:26,364
It's Chaz's birthday.
What the fuck?

1357
01:18:26,366 --> 01:18:27,364
- So?
- I didn't have a choice!

1358
01:18:27,366 --> 01:18:29,230
And if I told you,
you would've been pissed.

1359
01:18:29,232 --> 01:18:30,332
- Thought you don't drink.
- Ma's getting everyone

1360
01:18:30,334 --> 01:18:31,432
out of here, okay?
She just wants

1361
01:18:31,434 --> 01:18:33,231
- to hang out with the original crew, okay?
- Right.

1362
01:18:33,233 --> 01:18:35,231
- You're full of shit.
- Oh, my God! Maggie!

1363
01:18:35,233 --> 01:18:36,965
- God.
- I'm so happy you're here!

1364
01:18:36,967 --> 01:18:39,232
God, you're so beautiful.

1365
01:18:42,202 --> 01:18:43,200
What the fuck?

1366
01:18:43,202 --> 01:18:45,467
You should drink
some of the punch

1367
01:18:45,469 --> 01:18:47,133
that Ma made
for Chaz's birthday,

1368
01:18:47,135 --> 01:18:49,101
'cause it is so good.

1369
01:18:52,969 --> 01:18:55,069
No. No!

1370
01:18:55,071 --> 01:18:56,968
Ah!

1371
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:59,236
Okay, time for bed.

1372
01:18:59,238 --> 01:19:01,971
- Wait, it's almost over.
- I said turn it off.

1373
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:07,106
Open your mouth.

1374
01:19:20,342 --> 01:19:22,906
I hear all those people
downstairs.

1375
01:19:22,908 --> 01:19:24,474
I always do.

1376
01:19:24,476 --> 01:19:27,973
Good night.
Mommy loves you.

1377
01:19:45,245 --> 01:19:47,043
Shit.

1378
01:19:50,946 --> 01:19:52,445
Come on!

1379
01:19:55,681 --> 01:19:57,978
Hey. Hey.

1380
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:00,246
No, I know, I know. But I need
you to stay awake, okay?

1381
01:20:31,087 --> 01:20:32,518
Fuck.

1382
01:20:41,922 --> 01:20:43,454
Help, please.

1383
01:20:43,456 --> 01:20:45,222
Genie?

1384
01:20:54,124 --> 01:20:56,458
Help me. I'm in here.

1385
01:20:57,924 --> 01:20:59,925
Genie?

1386
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:05,125
Genie?

1387
01:21:11,461 --> 01:21:13,127
Oh, my God.

1388
01:21:39,231 --> 01:21:40,929
Mags!

1389
01:21:46,466 --> 01:21:49,966
I can feel those big doe eyes
watching me.

1390
01:21:55,134 --> 01:21:58,466
Maggie, you are something else.

1391
01:21:58,468 --> 01:22:00,367
That much diazepam
can knock out

1392
01:22:00,369 --> 01:22:02,933
a Great Dane for five hours.

1393
01:22:04,135 --> 01:22:06,101
<i>Mags, come on!</i>

1394
01:22:06,103 --> 01:22:09,134
It's my day off.
We're doing this.

1395
01:22:09,136 --> 01:22:10,269
You know...

1396
01:22:12,371 --> 01:22:15,068
...some people
just fit right in.

1397
01:22:18,171 --> 01:22:22,103
It comes effortlessly.

1398
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:24,037
Those perfect little touches.

1399
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:26,272
Perfect skin.

1400
01:22:28,005 --> 01:22:31,374
Oh, that perfect skin.

1401
01:22:32,407 --> 01:22:34,407
Perfect belly.

1402
01:22:37,308 --> 01:22:40,306
Must be nice, Most Handsome.

1403
01:22:43,075 --> 01:22:44,407
Oh!

1404
01:22:47,076 --> 01:22:48,876
Where you going?

1405
01:22:51,243 --> 01:22:54,044
Girl, you're pissing me off!

1406
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:06,411
And then Haley, Haley.

1407
01:23:06,413 --> 01:23:10,879
Most Popular,
born with the gift of gab.

1408
01:23:12,547 --> 01:23:15,145
I need a man, huh?

1409
01:23:15,147 --> 01:23:17,115
This ought to shut you up
for once.

1410
01:23:26,383 --> 01:23:28,282
What the...?

1411
01:23:33,484 --> 01:23:36,416
Stu, Maggie's gone.

1412
01:23:36,418 --> 01:23:40,216
Can you ju... can you come over?

1413
01:23:40,218 --> 01:23:42,085
Thank you. Okay.

1414
01:23:56,954 --> 01:23:59,153
You know how hard it is

1415
01:23:59,155 --> 01:24:01,487
to know that everybody's
having fun without you,

1416
01:24:01,489 --> 01:24:05,456
without even considering
that you might want to join in?

1417
01:24:08,123 --> 01:24:11,021
And the hard part...

1418
01:24:11,023 --> 01:24:15,290
is when they can't even see you
standing right beside them.

1419
01:24:17,191 --> 01:24:19,223
I'm sorry, Darrell.

1420
01:24:19,225 --> 01:24:21,458
They've only got room
for one of us.

1421
01:24:24,493 --> 01:24:27,157
What the...?

1422
01:24:42,162 --> 01:24:43,460
Ma?

1423
01:24:46,195 --> 01:24:48,728
Darling.

1424
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:50,261
Ma, are you mad at us?

1425
01:24:50,263 --> 01:24:52,461
Oh.

1426
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:54,429
Come here.

1427
01:24:54,431 --> 01:24:56,496
Come on, up, up.

1428
01:24:56,498 --> 01:24:59,497
Oh, you're a big boy.

1429
01:25:00,565 --> 01:25:03,497
Mmm, you smell good.

1430
01:25:03,499 --> 01:25:05,231
Just like your daddy.

1431
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:08,032
This feels nice.

1432
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:11,167
Yeah.

1433
01:25:12,967 --> 01:25:15,065
Like we're the only two people
in the world.

1434
01:25:18,335 --> 01:25:20,168
You know who we are?

1435
01:25:21,268 --> 01:25:23,267
The Cutest Couple.

1436
01:25:23,269 --> 01:25:25,035
We are.

1437
01:25:26,503 --> 01:25:29,237
You're Most Charming, too.

1438
01:25:30,504 --> 01:25:33,168
And...

1439
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,903
I love you.

1440
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,038
Stop!

1441
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,439
Liar.

1442
01:25:58,441 --> 01:25:59,473
Please!

1443
01:25:59,475 --> 01:26:02,106
Why are you doing this?

1444
01:26:02,108 --> 01:26:05,107
You need help.
You need help.

1445
01:26:07,109 --> 01:26:09,174
Not one fucking sound.

1446
01:26:09,176 --> 01:26:12,375
Not one fucking sound
or I will slit your throat.

1447
01:26:12,377 --> 01:26:13,377
You hear me?

1448
01:26:19,111 --> 01:26:21,309
Sue Ann, how you doing today?

1449
01:26:21,311 --> 01:26:22,576
I'm good.

1450
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:28,244
There are quite a few cups and
bottles in your yard right now

1451
01:26:28,246 --> 01:26:30,178
and, uh, couple cars
on the street

1452
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:32,044
parked near your driveway.

1453
01:26:32,046 --> 01:26:34,345
Is there anything
you need to share with me?

1454
01:26:34,347 --> 01:26:36,312
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1455
01:26:36,314 --> 01:26:41,447
Well... must be some sort of
a sorority prank or something.

1456
01:26:41,449 --> 01:26:44,580
I guess I'll have to spend the
whole day picking all that up.

1457
01:26:49,417 --> 01:26:52,049
Who's in this house with you,
Sue Ann?

1458
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:57,982
Mom, is everything okay?

1459
01:26:57,984 --> 01:27:01,049
My daughter is very sick,

1460
01:27:01,051 --> 01:27:03,016
and right now
you're preventing us

1461
01:27:03,018 --> 01:27:05,384
from getting her
to a doctor's appointment.

1462
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:08,050
I see.

1463
01:27:08,052 --> 01:27:10,050
My apologies, young lady.

1464
01:27:10,052 --> 01:27:11,421
I hope you feel better.

1465
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:15,920
Help! Somebody, please!

1466
01:27:20,255 --> 01:27:22,420
I told you to stay in bed.

1467
01:27:22,422 --> 01:27:25,187
You just made me kill this man.

1468
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:26,387
I did not!

1469
01:27:26,389 --> 01:27:29,054
Now get your ass
out of that chair

1470
01:27:29,056 --> 01:27:30,555
and help me drag him inside.

1471
01:27:39,158 --> 01:27:41,290
Erica, what's going on?
Where are we going?

1472
01:27:41,292 --> 01:27:43,123
I think she's off Highway 18.

1473
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:45,457
Okay. We'll find her.

1474
01:27:45,459 --> 01:27:47,460
I hope so.

1475
01:27:51,126 --> 01:27:54,125
Bad girl, Maggie.

1476
01:27:54,127 --> 01:27:56,325
I told you not to make a sound.

1477
01:27:56,327 --> 01:27:58,327
Get up.

1478
01:28:00,162 --> 01:28:03,162
Over here.
We have to set the picture.

1479
01:28:09,329 --> 01:28:11,262
Okay.

1480
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:14,497
Now go get Chaz
and put him against the couch.

1481
01:28:16,164 --> 01:28:18,363
And if you try
to leave this basement,

1482
01:28:18,365 --> 01:28:20,062
I'll kill all of you.

1483
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:26,197
Where do you want me?

1484
01:28:26,199 --> 01:28:27,997
Oh, you're not gonna be
in the picture.

1485
01:28:27,999 --> 01:28:29,267
You're gonna take it.

1486
01:28:31,467 --> 01:28:32,534
The button on the front.

1487
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:44,267
One more.

1488
01:28:47,069 --> 01:28:50,069
Oh, are you smiling?

1489
01:28:56,471 --> 01:28:58,371
Good girl.

1490
01:29:01,605 --> 01:29:04,003
No, no, no, no, no!

1491
01:29:08,273 --> 01:29:10,337
Ma!

1492
01:29:10,339 --> 01:29:13,138
Ma, he's still moving!

1493
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:14,138
Ma!

1494
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,207
Ma, help!

1495
01:29:41,012 --> 01:29:42,212
Oh.

1496
01:29:43,245 --> 01:29:44,379
I got you.

1497
01:29:50,447 --> 01:29:52,211
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1498
01:29:54,481 --> 01:29:56,546
Andy.

1499
01:29:56,548 --> 01:29:59,046
Breathe. Andy.

1500
01:29:59,048 --> 01:30:01,046
Okay. Breathe.

1501
01:30:01,048 --> 01:30:04,180
Andy. Andy, can you hear me?

1502
01:30:04,182 --> 01:30:06,181
Help! Help!

1503
01:30:06,183 --> 01:30:07,216
Help!

1504
01:30:08,216 --> 01:30:09,347
Help!

1505
01:30:14,217 --> 01:30:16,517
Help!

1506
01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:26,083
Come here.

1507
01:30:26,085 --> 01:30:27,952
- No, leave me alone!
- Genie, shut up!

1508
01:30:29,787 --> 01:30:30,618
Oh, my gosh.

1509
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:32,452
- Oh, my God!
- Maggie!

1510
01:30:32,454 --> 01:30:35,419
Mom! We need
to get Andy, okay? He's...

1511
01:30:35,421 --> 01:30:36,553
- Help me!
- No!

1512
01:30:36,555 --> 01:30:38,252
- Genie!
- Help me!

1513
01:30:38,254 --> 01:30:39,352
She's not gonna help you.

1514
01:30:39,354 --> 01:30:41,086
- No!
- Genie!

1515
01:30:41,088 --> 01:30:42,454
She's really
just like her mother.

1516
01:30:42,456 --> 01:30:43,487
You tell her!

1517
01:30:43,489 --> 01:30:45,787
Tell her how weak you were.

1518
01:30:45,789 --> 01:30:48,555
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay, Sue Ann?

1519
01:30:48,557 --> 01:30:52,121
What happened to you
should have never happened.

1520
01:30:52,123 --> 01:30:54,289
And I-I should have
stopped it, okay?!

1521
01:30:54,291 --> 01:30:56,222
- I should have stopped it!
- But you didn't!

1522
01:30:56,224 --> 01:30:57,957
You didn't!

1523
01:31:00,225 --> 01:31:02,123
You didn't.

1524
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:04,523
- Come on, baby.
- Help me, Maggie! No!

1525
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:07,257
- No, I'm sorry, Sue Ann! Please, I...
- Genie! Genie!

1526
01:31:07,259 --> 01:31:08,591
Sue Ann!

1527
01:31:08,593 --> 01:31:11,091
Time to go to sleep.
Mommy loves you.

1528
01:31:11,093 --> 01:31:15,225
You didn't deserve it, okay?!

1529
01:31:15,227 --> 01:31:18,026
- No. No, no, no.
- Mommy loves you.

1530
01:31:18,028 --> 01:31:19,295
Maggie, no!

1531
01:31:21,628 --> 01:31:23,563
Maggie!

1532
01:31:25,496 --> 01:31:29,096
I am not weak
and I'm not my mother.

1533
01:31:35,565 --> 01:31:39,262
Genie!

1534
01:31:39,264 --> 01:31:41,096
Maggie, come on!

1535
01:31:42,532 --> 01:31:44,399
Oh! Maggie!

1536
01:31:46,365 --> 01:31:49,033
Genie!

1537
01:31:50,033 --> 01:31:51,264
Oh.

1538
01:31:51,266 --> 01:31:53,100
You're okay.

1539
01:33:34,587 --> 01:33:35,617
