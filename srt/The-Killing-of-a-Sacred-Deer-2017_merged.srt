2
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:44,288
- Nice watch.
- Thanks.

3
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:45,289
What's
the water resistance?

4
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,224
200 meters.

5
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,358
And it's
got a date display?

6
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:48,859
Yes, it does.

7
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,294
I might have
gone for a metal strap

8
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:51,628
- instead of a leather strap.
- Really?

9
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:52,829
Yes.

10
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,599
I think I'd prefer
a metal strap.

11
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,001
I've had this one for years.

12
00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:58,001
It's as good as new.

13
00:03:58,002 --> 00:03:59,836
- What's the water resistance?
- 100 meters.

14
00:03:59,837 --> 00:04:02,940
- How long have you had it?
- Nine years.

15
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:05,075
A little bored of it, actually.

16
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:05,910
I've been thinking
of getting a new one

17
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:06,845
for quite a while now.

18
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,712
Okay,
this is what we'll do.

19
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:11,882
We'll go to the place
where I bought mine.

20
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:13,084
If I tell them you're
a colleague, a friend,

21
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,085
they'll definitely
give you a discount.

22
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:17,554
Both the owner and his father
have been patients of mine

23
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:19,756
so I know them quite well.

24
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:21,326
Think about it.

25
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:35,908
- Hi.
- Hi.

26
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,376
Sorry to keep you waiting.

27
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:40,677
Did you eat?

28
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:42,946
I just
had some apple pie.

29
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:45,116
Do you mind if I go grab
something to eat before we go?

30
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:48,085
- I'm starving.
- Sure, no problem.

31
00:04:48,086 --> 00:04:49,453
Are you sure you
don't want anything?

32
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:51,989
- Chicken wings or...
- No, thanks, I'm fine.

33
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,590
Do you have money,
I can give you some.

34
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:55,126
No, I've
got money, thanks.

35
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:57,028
I'll be right back.

36
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:18,883
- Did you get a haircut?
- Do you like it?

37
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:21,087
Looks great.

38
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:25,056
Aren't you going
to eat your fries?

39
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:27,058
I'm saving them till last.

40
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:28,025
Why?

41
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,092
I really like fries.

42
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:31,429
I always save them for last.

43
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,799
I do that too.

44
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:49,580
Sorry I was
late today, Steven.

45
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:51,482
It doesn't matter.

46
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:53,551
I was over
at a friend's house.

47
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:56,821
He got a new motorcycle,
I wanted to check it out.

48
00:05:56,822 --> 00:06:00,691
He took me for a ride,
that's why I was late.

49
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:02,994
It's fine.

50
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,830
He even let me
ride it for a little bit.

51
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:07,164
I hope you
were wearing helmets.

52
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:09,700
Yeah,
of course we were.

53
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:12,838
We weren't going
very fast anyway.

54
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,448
I got you a present.

55
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,616
Thank you very much.

56
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:27,217
What is it?

57
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:28,420
What is it?

58
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,429
It's very nice.

59
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,499
Can I give you a hug?

60
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,037
Thank you very much.

61
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:56,681
That's fantastic.

62
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,183
It's water
resistant up to 200 meters.

63
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:00,618
Does this come off?

64
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:01,953
I prefer a leather strap.

65
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,787
It comes off, yes.

66
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:06,023
You can put on any
strap you like.

67
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:07,191
But metal are more hard-wearing,

68
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:08,825
that's why I got
you the metal strap.

69
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:11,196
It's more expensive, too.

70
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,912
Dad?

71
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:30,280
If Kim goes to the
party, can I go with her?

72
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:31,948
I don't
know, darling.

73
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,717
Your mother and I will
discuss it and we'll see.

74
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:35,186
I'd say they can go.

75
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,321
Claire is a very nice girl.

76
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,222
She's the girl you met at
the mall with her parents,

77
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:40,691
who asked about
becoming a doctor.

78
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:43,527
She's the one who wants
to be a cardiologist.

79
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:45,131
Yes, I remember.

80
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:49,799
How was work today?

81
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,201
Fine.

82
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:52,837
How about you?

83
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:55,873
I've decided to make
some changes at the clinic.

84
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:59,576
I think I'm going to get it
painted and buy a new couch.

85
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:02,212
Look at you, all
hunched over like that.

86
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:03,780
How many times do
I have to tell you?

87
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:05,249
You'll strain your back.

88
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,751
Your hair is Practically
trailing in your food.

89
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:10,587
Bob, you promised
me you'd get a haircut

90
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:11,688
and you still haven't done it.

91
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:14,860
- I'll get a haircut.
- Tomorrow.

92
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:16,761
Not tomorrow, Dad.

93
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,364
After the party.

94
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:21,265
I like his hair long.

95
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,200
He has lovely hair.

96
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:26,203
- What about mine?
- You have lovely hair, too.

97
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,506
We all have lovely hair.

98
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,911
I bought that dress
that you liked.

99
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:35,345
I'll wear it for you tomorrow.

100
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:37,181
I can't show it to you
now, it needed alterations.

101
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,149
I'm picking it up tomorrow.

102
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,151
The black one?

103
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,119
It was the black one
you liked, wasn't it?

104
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,354
Yes.

105
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,221
The other one looked
great on you, too.

106
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:46,657
But I think the black
one was perfect.

107
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:47,925
I'm worried
it's a little too short.

108
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:50,226
I'd like it better if
it were below the knee.

109
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:53,330
You look amazing, however
long or short the dress is.

110
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:55,099
Tomorrow I'm gonna
bake a lemon cake

111
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,234
and nobody's gonna
eat any of it but you.

112
00:08:57,235 --> 00:09:01,138
- Not even the kids?
- Not even the kids.

113
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,273
Poor kids.

114
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:03,874
Did I tell you
Bob announced the other day

115
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,210
that he wants to be
an ophthalmologist?

116
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:07,244
Yes, you did.

117
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:11,081
Bob would be a coal miner
if you were one too.

118
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:14,987
Could you turn on some
more light, please?

119
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:26,263
General anesthetic?

120
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:29,068
General anesthetic.

121
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:00,932
How's that?

122
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,935
Perfect.

123
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:25,016
Hi.

124
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:31,388
Look, I told you, best not
to come to the hospital

125
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:34,291
- without calling me first.
- I know, you're right.

126
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:35,493
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,762
I just wanted to
thank you again.

128
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:41,398
And to show you my new
strap I got for my watch.

129
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,737
I exchanged the metal
strap for a leather one.

130
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:47,571
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:52,042
I didn't mean to put you
in this awkward position.

132
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:53,178
Goodbye.

133
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:56,013
Martin.

134
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:56,948
Come here.

135
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,216
What kind of strap did you get?

136
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:02,754
- Brown leather.
- Show me.

137
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:06,923
- It's very nice.
- You think so?

138
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:07,957
Or are you just saying that?

139
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,260
I really like it.

140
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:12,329
Next time you want to come
here, please call me first.

141
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,564
You have my number.

142
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:14,764
It's for your own good.

143
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:18,435
I might be with a patient or
in surgery, or in a meeting.

144
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,571
There's no point in you waiting
around if I can't see you.

145
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:21,906
It's for your own good.

146
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,106
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Steven.

147
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:24,908
I have those test results.

148
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:26,442
Shall I leave them on your desk?

149
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:28,144
Please do, yeah, I'll take
a look at them in a minute.

150
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:31,080
- Great.
- We've got the same watch.

151
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:33,082
Let me introduce you.

152
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,552
This young man

153
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,522
is one of my
daughter's schoolmates.

154
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:42,426
I ran into Martin and his
parents at the mall last week.

155
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:45,061
He told me he's very
interested in medicine.

156
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:46,297
He wants to be cardiologist.

157
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,598
Ah.

158
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:50,167
I suggested he
stop by sometime.

159
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:53,003
So he can see what being
a doctor's really about.

160
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:55,471
Martin, this is Matthew,
great friend of mine.

161
00:12:55,472 --> 00:12:57,575
And an excellent
anesthesiologist.

162
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,310
That's great.

163
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:03,147
Nice to meet you.

164
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:05,481
Nice to meet you, too.

165
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:08,486
Let me know when you're ready.

166
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:14,325
I've got to go back in now.

167
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,593
We'll talk on the phone to
arrange our next meeting.

168
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,094
- Alright?
- Okay.

169
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:18,230
Goodbye.

170
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:50,561
I think your
breathing's really improved

171
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:51,662
over the last three months.

172
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:54,098
That's what the
choir director said, too.

173
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,899
Did you tell her to
move you closer to the front?

174
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,133
Yes, I did.

175
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:59,202
She said she'd see
what she can do.

176
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:01,037
Bob, did
you water the plants?

177
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:02,505
Mum said she
would water them.

178
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,173
Your mother
works very hard.

179
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:05,142
That's why we said
it would be nice

180
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:06,377
to help out all that we can.

181
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,046
And we agreed that Kim would
take care of walking the dog.

182
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:12,383
And you would take
care of the plants.

183
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,418
How about I walk the
dog and Kim can do the plants?

184
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,987
You're too young to be
wandering around at night

185
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:18,290
by yourself.

186
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:23,226
- Thanks for the brush.
- You're welcome.

187
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:25,561
We have to go.

188
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:26,696
Tell Bob
to water the plants

189
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:28,364
now that the sun has gone down.

190
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:29,332
I watered them already.

191
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,536
Come on, we're gonna be late.

192
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:34,573
Goodnight, darling.

193
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:51,321
A full 40 years have passed
since the German cardiologist

194
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:55,392
Andreas Gruentzig performed
the first coronary angioplasty,

195
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:57,696
on September 16th, 1977.

196
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:02,966
Today, that first patient
is still alive and well.

197
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:06,637
Doctor Gruentzig, however,
had an unfortunate accident

198
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:09,605
and met with an untimely end.

199
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:13,076
In short, he is one of those
rare cases where we can say,

200
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:17,513
the operation was a
success, but unfortunately

201
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:21,987
the doctor didn't make it.

202
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,724
In the four decades
that have passed

203
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,125
since that first
coronary angioplasty,

204
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:30,594
many things have changed.

205
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:33,629
A new wave of techniques
and scientific breakthroughs

206
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,697
have brought us

207
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:36,099
- minimally invasive...
- I'm going for a cigarette.

208
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,234
- I'll be in the bar.
- Okay.

209
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:38,701
Endovascular
aortic surgery,

210
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:40,637
and new treatments
for heart failure

211
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:43,106
that include stem cell therapy,

212
00:15:43,107 --> 00:15:45,676
left ventricular remodeling,
and by all indications

213
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:50,314
the rapidly expanding use of
mechanical circulatory support.

214
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:52,483
The guy that
made it told me what was in it.

215
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:56,519
And now I can't remember now
but it is very refreshing.

216
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,790
- Would you like one?
- No, thank you.

217
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,792
Try it,
it's really delicious.

218
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:04,394
You can use this straw,
I haven't touched it.

219
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:06,696
He hasn't had a
drink in three years.

220
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:09,599
High GGTs, elevated
transaminases.

221
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,468
Oh, good
on you for not drinking.

222
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:14,204
Well I wouldn't say no to a
cocktail if you're offering.

223
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:16,273
Of course,
I'll get you one right away.

224
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:17,441
We should go soon.

225
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:18,675
- Yeah.
- It's early.

226
00:16:18,676 --> 00:16:19,777
He's got surgery
in the morning.

227
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:20,811
He needs to get some sleep.

228
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,513
It's still early.

229
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,379
We've have got
surgery in the morning.

230
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,782
Fine, okay.

231
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:26,417
How are the kids?

232
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,750
They're doing very well.

233
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:29,353
Bob has started piano lessons.

234
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:31,821
The teacher says
he's very talented.

235
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:34,258
Now we have to get him one
so he can practice at home.

236
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,792
I just haven't gotten
around to it yet.

237
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:37,527
I'm renovating the clinic.

238
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:38,762
I'm on the phone all day.

239
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:41,398
Our daughter started
menstruating last week.

240
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,666
- Great.
- Yes.

241
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,700
She was a little scared
but she's okay now.

242
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:45,635
You haven't seen her in ages.

243
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:48,372
Not since last summer
at the school choir.

244
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:49,507
Recital.

245
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,808
You and Mary should come
over one night for dinner.

246
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:53,609
You really shouldn't
stay late, either.

247
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,146
Drink that cocktail you've
ordered, get yourself home.

248
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:58,816
You've gotta be at the
hospital in six hours.

249
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,517
- Time to go, darling.
- Yes.

250
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:03,554
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Matthew.

251
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:09,727
- It was a good night.
- I think so.

252
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,268
Do you
have many friends?

253
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:22,139
Not that many.

254
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,174
I don't think people can
have a lot of friends.

255
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:27,378
I mean, it's difficult.

256
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:29,379
The most important thing in life

257
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,385
is to have good friends,
not lots of friends.

258
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:37,320
That's what my dad used to say.

259
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:39,256
Your father was
absolutely right.

260
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:40,726
Yes, I know.

261
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,894
I have a very good friend who
plays basketball in school.

262
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:47,698
Sometimes we play it together.

263
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:52,768
I also consider my
mom to be a friend.

264
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:54,238
I know it might sound strange,

265
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,405
but ever since my father died,

266
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:59,810
we've been very
close, me and my mom.

267
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:05,214
We talk about things,
lots of things.

268
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:08,518
And she helps me as much as
she can with a lot of stuff.

269
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,155
I help her, too.

270
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,290
I'd like to ask you a favor.

271
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,293
Only if you want to, of course.

272
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:18,327
I don't want you to feel
pressured or obliged.

273
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:22,800
It just seemed to me like a
good idea, so I thought I'd ask.

274
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,902
I'd like you to come
by my house one day.

275
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:28,838
To meet my wife and children.

276
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:31,275
I think you'll get along great.

277
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,078
What do you think?

278
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,632
Good afternoon,
you must be Martin.

279
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,200
That's right.

280
00:18:57,201 --> 00:19:00,304
- You must be Anna.
- That's right.

281
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,837
These
flowers are for you.

282
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:04,540
Your husband told me
you like orchids but

283
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:08,312
I couldn't find any fresh cut
ones so I brought you roses.

284
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,845
How do you like roses?

285
00:19:09,846 --> 00:19:12,583
Thank you very much,
Martin, I love roses.

286
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,518
That's very kind of you.

287
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,720
Come on in.

288
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:20,224
Steven is waiting
for you in the yard.

289
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:30,933
- This is Bob.
- Very nice to meet you.

290
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:32,702
And this is Kim.

291
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:33,937
Very
nice to meet you.

292
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:35,905
I brought you some little gifts.

293
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:37,807
That's
very kind of you.

294
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:40,243
It's a key ring with a
musical note on it for Kim,

295
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:43,147
because I know she likes music.

296
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:47,617
And one with a
smiley face for Bob.

297
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:49,585
What do we say, Bob?

298
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:50,722
Thanks.

299
00:19:52,923 --> 00:19:54,891
How lovely.

300
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:57,460
Well, we should probably eat.

301
00:19:57,461 --> 00:19:58,929
Are you hungry, Martin?

302
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,232
I'm starving.

303
00:20:04,868 --> 00:20:07,970
How long have you been
in the choir, Kim?

304
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:11,008
Two years, since I was 12.

305
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,209
Do you like singing?

306
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:17,048
I love it but I
haven't got a very good voice.

307
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:20,251
- How old are you?
- 16.

308
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:23,353
Have you got
hair under your arms yet?

309
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:24,520
Yes.

310
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:27,258
I just got my first period.

311
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:32,695
Do you mind if I
light a cigarette?

312
00:20:32,696 --> 00:20:34,831
- You'd better not.
- It's alright.

313
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:37,602
Just go over by the window.

314
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:50,447
Can you
sing us something?

315
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:51,815
What, now?

316
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:54,383
Yes, anything you like.

317
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:56,787
No, not right now.

318
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,454
She's embarrassed.

319
00:20:58,455 --> 00:20:59,690
No I'm not.

320
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,058
Just don't feel like it.

321
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,960
When did you start smoking?

322
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:05,394
About eight months ago.

323
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:07,096
I was over at a friend's place.

324
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:09,098
It was a party, actually.

325
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:11,067
And this girl offered
me a cigarette

326
00:21:11,068 --> 00:21:13,871
and I said why not and lit up.

327
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:19,075
That was a mistake, I regret it.

328
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:22,580
But it's too late
now, I'm addicted.

329
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:26,016
Can you show me
the hair under your arms?

330
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:27,152
Sure.

331
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:32,989
You haven't got that much.

332
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,358
Have you seen how
hairy my dad is?

333
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,460
No.

334
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,999
He's got three
times more hair than you do.

335
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:44,534
You've got a great body.

336
00:21:44,535 --> 00:21:45,670
Thanks.

337
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,107
Do you wanna go out for a walk?

338
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:52,944
It's a nice day.

339
00:21:54,811 --> 00:21:58,481
I'd rather stay
here and listen to music.

340
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:00,116
Is that my MP3
player or yours?

341
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:01,852
Mine.

342
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,787
And don't you dare take
this one and lose it too.

343
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:07,089
What kind of music
do you listen to?

344
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,725
All kinds.

345
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:11,094
I'm into metal and punk.

346
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:12,229
What about you?

347
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,031
I think it's worth listening
to all kinds of music.

348
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:19,169
Depends on my mood
and what I'm doing.

349
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,938
I'll come for a walk
with you if you want.

350
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:24,874
We can take the dog with
us if you don't mind.

351
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:28,111
I'd prefer if it was
just the two of us.

352
00:22:28,112 --> 00:22:31,014
I get nervous around dogs

353
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:34,750
in case they get into a
fight with another dog.

354
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:38,956

dogs fighting scares me.

- Yes.
- It's amazing.

381
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:10,279
My mom makes lemonade, too.

382
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,516
She hasn't made it
in a while, though.

383
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,683
I'll ask her to make some.

384
00:24:14,684 --> 00:24:16,320
I love lemonade.

385
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:19,689
I'd like
to meet your mother.

386
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,758
And we can have a
lemonade contest.

387
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,993
She'd like that.

388
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:28,597
The kids' rooms are
amazing, so big and bright.

389
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:31,233
You're welcome to spend
the night if you want.

390
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:33,937
We can easily fit a mattress
on the floor next to Bob's bed.

391
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:35,171
You two can hang
out in the morning

392
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:37,207
and I'll drop you home
tomorrow afternoon.

393
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,976
Thank you very much
but I'd rather not.

394
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:41,710
I gotta get home tonight.

395
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:45,181
I don't like leaving
my mom by herself.

396
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:47,182
Whatever you want.

397
00:24:47,183 --> 00:24:49,251
Where did you two go?

398
00:24:49,252 --> 00:24:50,987
Just for a walk.

399
00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:52,989
I love
this neighborhood.

400
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,527
So quiet, clean, beautiful.

401
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,327
Where do you live, Martin?

402
00:24:58,328 --> 00:25:00,896
We live in a
not-so-nice neighborhood

403
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:03,133
in a not-so-nice house.

404
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:05,369
Up north.

405
00:25:08,204 --> 00:25:10,340
What a charming boy.

406
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,111
Isn't he?

407
00:25:13,711 --> 00:25:15,012
Yes, very.

408
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,815
How did his father die?

409
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:21,585
Car
crash, driving home.

410
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,820
Smashed into a pole,
killed instantly.

411
00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:26,789
How long have you known him?

412
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,990
Quite some time.

413
00:25:27,991 --> 00:25:30,962
He was a patient
of mine, years ago.

414
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:36,266
- Did you go to the funeral?
- I did go, yes.

415
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:39,102
Why didn't
I go with you?

416
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:40,370
I think
I told you about it

417
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:43,241
but you were busy or something.

418
00:25:48,913 --> 00:25:51,081
You should tell
him to come round again.

419
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,350
I will, he'll
be great company for Bob.

420
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,151
I thought next time I could
take both of them out somewhere,

421
00:25:55,152 --> 00:25:57,220
for a bike ride.

422
00:25:57,221 --> 00:26:01,893
You should get that,
it could be the hospital.

423
00:26:05,695 --> 00:26:07,262
Hello?

424
00:26:07,263 --> 00:26:10,633
Hello, how are you?

425
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:13,268
I'm fine, Martin.

426
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:14,938
Is something wrong?

427
00:26:14,939 --> 00:26:16,306
No, I just
called to tell you

428
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:19,176
I had a wonderful time today.

429
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:21,978
I'm very pleased to hear that.

430
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:25,414
Yes, I thought
I should return the favor.

431
00:26:25,415 --> 00:26:30,019
So I'd like to invite you
to dinner, at my house.

432
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,354
My mom will be
delighted to see you.

433
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:37,360
She hasn't seen you in two
years, not since the hospital.

434
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:39,796
She'll make meatloaf.

435
00:26:39,797 --> 00:26:42,031
That's very kind of you.

436
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:44,700
- We'll do that someday.
- Tomorrow night.

437
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:46,368
I told her already.

438
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:49,271
I've asked her to make
meatloaf and lemonade.

439
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:51,674
I'll be home by 6:30.

440
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:52,976
Around 7:30?

441
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:28,444
Did you come
by the hospital today?

442
00:27:28,445 --> 00:27:29,380
No.

443
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:33,415
I was in school and
then I went to the gym.

444
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:35,351
Weren't you down at
the hospital today?

445
00:27:35,352 --> 00:27:38,121
I was, but
I was really busy.

446
00:27:38,122 --> 00:27:42,593
I just wondered whether you
came by and couldn't find me.

447
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:47,730
I thought we could
all watch a movie together.

448
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:49,499
If you don't mind.

449
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,233
I'd like
to watch a movie.

450
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:54,170
I'm sorry, I have
to be getting home soon.

451
00:27:54,171 --> 00:27:55,805
I can't be out too late.

452
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:57,306
I didn't tell my wife
I'd be late tonight

453
00:27:57,307 --> 00:27:59,441
and she might get worried.

454
00:27:59,442 --> 00:28:01,411
You could call her.

455
00:28:01,412 --> 00:28:04,213
Anyway, if you feel tired,
you could stop the movie.

456
00:28:04,214 --> 00:28:06,181
Could go home and we
could watch the rest

457
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:07,416
next time you come.

458
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:08,985
Please, it's my
favorite movie.

459
00:28:08,986 --> 00:28:12,788
It was also my father's
favorite movie too.

460
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:15,424
Special today is
blueberry waffles.

461
00:28:15,425 --> 00:28:17,259
Why are
you telling me this?

462
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,828
Because I
want you to believe in me.

463
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:22,397
You're not a god, you
can take my word for it.

464
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:25,067
This is 12 years of
Catholic school talking.

465
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:27,303
I could come back
if you're not ready.

466
00:28:27,304 --> 00:28:28,904
How do
you know I'm not a god?

467
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:33,543
- Oh...
- I think I'll go to bed.

468
00:28:33,544 --> 00:28:38,216
I'm sorry I can't watch the
rest of the movie with you.

469
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:41,985
Goodnight.

470
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,554
Goodnight, Martin.

471
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:47,257
Groundhog,
legend has it he can predict

472
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,992
the coming of an early spring.

473
00:28:49,993 --> 00:28:53,529
So I guess the question we have
to ask ourselves today is...

474
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,266
Have you
been married long?

475
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,236
16 years.

476
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:08,443
You
have lovely hands.

477
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:10,279
Thank you.

478
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,549
Most doctors
have beautiful hands.

479
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,486
So white and soft and clean.

480
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:17,821
- Really?
- Yes.

481
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:22,825
I remember your hands from back

482
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:26,496
when I used to visit my
husband at the hospital.

483
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:30,165
In fact, I even told
him about your hands.

484
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:31,636
And he agreed.

485
00:29:32,202 --> 00:29:34,237
"You're right", he said.

486
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:36,641
"He has beautiful hands."

487
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,676
Thank you very much.

488
00:29:40,877 --> 00:29:43,579
Do you remember me
coming to the hospital?

489
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,649
Of course.

490
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:49,986
I was a little heavier
then and my hair was brown.

491
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:51,556
Yes.

492
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,556
I got tired of it.

493
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:57,395
I dyed it about a month ago.

494
00:29:58,261 --> 00:30:00,162
Did you prefer me
with brown hair?

495
00:30:00,163 --> 00:30:02,300
Like it was back then?

496
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:06,001
I think it's nicer now.

497
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:08,305
Yes, I agree.

498
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:19,515
Would you like some dessert?

499
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:21,853
I made a caramel tart.

500
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:26,322
- No, thank you.
- Maybe later then.

501
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:30,795
You did have a lot to eat.

502
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:41,872
Can I take a closer
look at your hands?

503
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:03,325
Don't worry, he's
definitely asleep.

504
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:05,193
There's nothing to be afraid of.

505
00:31:05,194 --> 00:31:07,596
In any case, he wants
this as much as I do.

506
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:08,797
I have to go.

507
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,001
I'm sorry if I made you feel
awkward, I didn't mean to.

508
00:31:13,002 --> 00:31:16,038
But I won't let you leave
until you've tried my tart.

509
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,606
Please, I'll get
you a piece now.

510
00:31:17,607 --> 00:31:18,408
Please, sit down.

511
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,476
I'm sorry, I
really have to go.

512
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:21,612
Goodnight.

513
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,133
Good morning.

514
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:46,068
What
are you doing here?

515
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:47,236
Why aren't you in school?

516
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:49,338
My heart aches.

517
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,975
What do you mean?

518
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,343
I'm in pain.

519
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,510
My chest, it hurts.

520
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:57,113
My heart.

521
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:58,347
I'm worried.

522
00:31:58,348 --> 00:32:01,616
There's no need for
you to be worried.

523
00:32:01,617 --> 00:32:05,688
I'm worried because
it's hereditary.

524
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:07,123
You're too
young to be worried.

525
00:32:07,124 --> 00:32:09,624
That's what you
said about my father.

526
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,261
He didn't smoke.

527
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,532
He ate a very healthy diet.

528
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:18,534
He went swimming
almost every day.

529
00:32:18,535 --> 00:32:23,007
He should have come out of that
surgery alive, but he died.

530
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,509
I smoke.

531
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:28,613
I started smoking recently.

532
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:33,017
It hurts here.

533
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,261
I hardly slept at
all last night.

534
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:47,665
My mom was so worried,
I slept in her bed.

535
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:06,649
If I had hair on
my chest and belly,

536
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,817
how would you attach these?

537
00:33:08,818 --> 00:33:11,354
We'd shave the hair off first.

538
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:13,823
How long does it take
for the hair to grow back?

539
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:16,124
I don't know.

540
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:18,462
About a month, I suppose.

541
00:33:20,396 --> 00:33:22,297
Your son told me that
you've got lots of hair

542
00:33:22,298 --> 00:33:24,066
under your arms.

543
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,700
Three times more than I do.

544
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:27,836
And that you've got
a very hairy back

545
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:30,506
and a very hairy belly.

546
00:33:30,507 --> 00:33:31,841
I probably do have a
little more hair than you do

547
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:34,277
because I'm older than you.

548
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,578
But soon you'll
have more hair, too.

549
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:38,713
It's all down to hormones.

550
00:33:38,714 --> 00:33:41,383
Can you show me, please?

551
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:45,690
Can you take off your
shirt and show me, please?

552
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,024
Please.

553
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:12,881
Okay, you do have
more hair than I do

554
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:15,218
but not three times more.

555
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,451
Me and my mom thought
it would be nice

556
00:34:16,452 --> 00:34:18,855
if you came by for
dinner tonight.

557
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:22,325
We could watch the
rest of the movie.

558
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,593
Does eight sound good for you?

559
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:28,330
That's very kind of you but
I just can't make it tonight.

560
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:29,799
I need to be at home.

561
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,734
Can't you get
away for a couple of hours?

562
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:32,667
I can't.

563
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:34,203
No.

564
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:35,904
Some other time.

565
00:34:35,905 --> 00:34:38,274
My mom's gonna be upset.

566
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:39,908
Can I tell you a secret?

567
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,578
But don't tell her I told you.

568
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:44,747
I think she, I
think she likes you.

569
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:47,383
I mean, she's attracted to you.

570
00:34:47,384 --> 00:34:51,553
But she says that's not
true, but it is, I'm sure.

571
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:55,558
And, to be honest, I think
you're perfect for each other.

572
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:58,194
You'd make a great couple.

573
00:34:58,195 --> 00:35:00,263
She's got a great body.

574
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,899
You've seen it for yourself.

575
00:35:06,235 --> 00:35:10,707
She lost weight and she
has a really great figure.

576
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,709
Your mother is very beautiful,

577
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,279
but the idea that she and
I could ever be together

578
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,615
is ludicrous.

579
00:35:18,514 --> 00:35:20,950
Let me remind you,
I'm a married man.

580
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:23,218
And I love my wife
very much and my kids,

581
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:25,654
and that we are
very happy together.

582
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:28,191
And for your information,
you're absolutely fine.

583
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,692
There's nothing wrong with you.

584
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:31,861
But you really
should stop smoking.

585
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:33,631
Do you promise?

586
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:35,730
So we're okay?

587
00:35:35,731 --> 00:35:38,433
There is nothing wrong with me?

588
00:35:38,434 --> 00:35:40,770
You couldn't be healthier.

589
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:45,443
You should really go now
because I'm late for my rounds.

590
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:53,381
Don't use
that knife, here.

591
00:35:53,382 --> 00:35:56,451
Use this one, it's much sharper.

592
00:35:56,452 --> 00:35:57,687
There you go, doctor.

593
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:00,223
Thank you, nurse.

594
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,359
Oh, and don't forget
to slice off the cheeks.

595
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,796
- They're delicious.
- I can do that.

596
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:13,236
Where are you?

597
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,341
I called you 100 times,
didn't you see my calls?

598
00:36:19,342 --> 00:36:20,542
Yeah, I'm here.

599
00:36:22,945 --> 00:36:24,879
What do you mean you can't?

600
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,984
I got you a slice of apple pie.

601
00:36:28,952 --> 00:36:30,620
No, no, you have to.

602
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:34,859
I've been, I've been waiting
for over a half an hour.

603
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:39,895
Just come for a little while.

604
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:42,564
I can come closer
to where you are.

605
00:36:42,565 --> 00:36:44,868
Are you at the hospital?

606
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:48,271
I can bring you the apple pie.

607
00:36:49,405 --> 00:36:52,041
What's, what's so important?

608
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:55,944
Is it a, is it an operation?

609
00:36:55,945 --> 00:36:57,946
Are you at the hospital?

610
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:05,622
I love the
sound of those cooking.

611
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:15,665
Where were you?

612
00:37:16,465 --> 00:37:19,868
I was
inside, making a call.

613
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:21,002
The fish
is almost ready.

614
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:23,071
Pass me your plate.

615
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,372
I'll get them.

616
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:26,509
I need to wash my hands anyway.

617
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,146
Thank you, my dear.

618
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:36,951
Do you need a hand?

619
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:38,756
No, that's okay.

620
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:43,892
I forgot to tell you, I
saw that boy yesterday.

621
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:46,027
Your daughter's schoolmate.

622
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:47,830
Martin?

623
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:49,999
Yes, right, Martin.

624
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,767
Couldn't remember his name.

625
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,337
- Where did you see him?
- At the hospital.

626
00:37:55,338 --> 00:37:56,571
He was hanging around your car.

627
00:37:56,572 --> 00:37:58,908
It looked like he
was waiting for you.

628
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,877
I tried to say hello but
he pretended not to see me.

629
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:03,847
That's impossible.

630
00:38:04,414 --> 00:38:05,881
Can't have been him.

631
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:09,919
I could be wrong but
it looked a lot like him.

632
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,053
Take my piece off
the grill, will you?

633
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:14,624
I don't like it overdone.

634
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:30,006
Hi, Dad.

635
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,973
Hello, darling.
Where have you been?

636
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:33,609
Choir practice.

637
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,111
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, I ate earlier.

638
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:38,013
You don't have
to take the dog for a walk.

639
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:40,850
I took her out already, I
got back a little while ago.

640
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,118
Okay.

641
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,386
Dad, do you know
who I saw today?

642
00:38:44,387 --> 00:38:45,888
- Who, darling?
- Martin.

643
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:47,022
Martin who?

644
00:38:47,023 --> 00:38:50,024
Martin, that boy who came
over here the other day.

645
00:38:50,025 --> 00:38:52,127
The son of your ex-patient.

646
00:38:52,128 --> 00:38:53,729
He brought me back
from choir practice

647
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,830
on his friend's motorcycle.

648
00:38:55,831 --> 00:38:56,999
He's really funny.

649
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,169
I laughed so hard my ribs hurt.

650
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,673
Yes, he is very funny.

651
00:39:03,172 --> 00:39:05,140
Kim, I don't want you
riding on motorcycles

652
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:06,042
without a helmet.

653
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,877
I was wearing a
helmet, he gave me his.

654
00:39:08,878 --> 00:39:10,578
Why didn't
you ask him to come in?

655
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:12,180
I did but he was in a hurry.

656
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:13,948
He had to get home.

657
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:14,950
Where's Mom?

658
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:16,051
She's
taking a shower.

659
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:19,020
Is there something you need?

660
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:21,089
I'm going to bed.

661
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,159
Goodnight, darling.

662
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:18,781
Did you wake Bob?

663
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:20,216
I did.

664
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,218
He just likes lying in bed
before getting up, leave him be.

665
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:25,821
You want me to squeeze you
some more orange juice?

666
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:26,689
He'll be late.

667
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,591
Have you seen the time?

668
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,828
School bus will be
here any minute.

669
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,236
Robert, do you have any
idea what time it is?

670
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,473
Get up and get dressed.

671
00:40:44,173 --> 00:40:45,875
I can't get up.

672
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,142
You have 10
minutes to get washed,

673
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:48,877
dressed and eat your breakfast.

674
00:40:48,878 --> 00:40:50,078
I'm not going to
drive you to school

675
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,082
and neither is your mother.

676
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,049
I can't get up.

677
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:55,917
Bob, get
up and get dressed

678
00:40:55,918 --> 00:40:58,287
and stop messing around.

679
00:40:58,288 --> 00:40:59,823
Dad.

680
00:41:00,523 --> 00:41:01,256
My legs.

681
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:02,825
They're numb.

682
00:41:03,793 --> 00:41:05,796
I can't move them.

683
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,265
I can't stand up.

684
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:45,834
Do you know
where you are right now?

685
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm at the hospital,
the neurology department.
You're
absolutely right.
Can you tell me what
day it is today?

686
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:54,944
Thursday.

687
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:55,877
Right again.

688
00:41:55,878 --> 00:41:58,147
Now, I'm going to take this pin,

689
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:01,783
and I'm going to touch the soles
of your feet and your toes,

690
00:42:01,784 --> 00:42:02,718
and I want you to tell me...

691
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:07,990
Can you feel this?

692
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,162
Can you feel this?

693
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,631
For this one,
you're gonna sit up

694
00:42:15,632 --> 00:42:18,135
and look right at me, okay?

695
00:42:29,378 --> 00:42:30,312
Good.

696
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:32,348
Now stick out your tongue.

697
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,863
What happened?

698
00:42:47,864 --> 00:42:49,297
Everything's
absolutely fine.

699
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:52,667
Larry gave him a thorough
neurological exam, it's nothing.

700
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:55,337
You two go home and
we'll talk tonight.

701
00:42:55,338 --> 00:42:57,772
I won't be late, my schedule
today is pretty light.

702
00:42:57,773 --> 00:42:59,073
Okay?

703
00:42:59,074 --> 00:43:01,343
Maybe he
should get an MRI.

704
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:03,812
There's no need
to bother with all that.

705
00:43:03,813 --> 00:43:06,314
He just got scared, that's all.

706
00:43:06,315 --> 00:43:08,350
He's absolutely fine; you're
absolutely fine, aren't you?

707
00:43:08,351 --> 00:43:09,919
Yeah.

708
00:43:11,054 --> 00:43:12,321
I think maybe there
was a test at school today

709
00:43:12,322 --> 00:43:14,256
that we hadn't
prepared for very well.

710
00:43:14,257 --> 00:43:15,957
Yes, he wanted to
spend the day at the hospital

711
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:17,725
with Larry and us.

712
00:43:17,726 --> 00:43:19,194
Let's go.

713
00:43:19,195 --> 00:43:20,428
- Dad.
- Yeah?

714
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:22,430
Aren't you going to
show us an operating theater?

715
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:23,366
Another
time, darling.

716
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,234
They need me to prep
for surgery right away.

717
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,201
I have to go, I'll
see you tonight.

718
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,082
Excuse me, can
we get some help here?

719
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:15,417
He needs some help.

720
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:49,752
MRI, MRA both fine.

721
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:52,221
Blood work came back good.

722
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:55,223
Cardiogram, chest
X-ray, all clear.

723
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:58,861
Has he been under any
psychological stress lately?

724
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,495
Exams at school maybe?

725
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:02,397
- Yes.
- He's not stressed.

726
00:45:02,398 --> 00:45:03,531
He's fine.

727
00:45:03,532 --> 00:45:07,268
He's a little anxious but
that's just the way he is.

728
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:10,506
In my opinion, he
should stay in tomorrow as well,

729
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,774
just so we can
keep an eye on him.

730
00:45:12,775 --> 00:45:14,176
What about a PET scan?

731
00:45:14,177 --> 00:45:16,477
I don't think there's
any need for that.

732
00:45:16,478 --> 00:45:18,247
What do you think, Larry?

733
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,448
And tomorrow he'll be well
enough to walk all the way home.

734
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:23,118
Yes, I don't think it's
necessary at this point.

735
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,419
Let's see how things go tomorrow

736
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,455
and we'll take it from there.

737
00:45:27,456 --> 00:45:30,424
There's nothing to worry
about, in my opinion.

738
00:45:30,425 --> 00:45:35,397
You go home, we'll speak tomorrow,
and I'll be here all day.

739
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:38,135
And, Anna, great seeing you,

740
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,270
even under these circumstances.

741
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:42,471
You, too, Larry.

742
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:44,806
- Goodnight.
- Bye, Larry.

743
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:46,841
And thanks for everything.

744
00:45:46,842 --> 00:45:47,843
Do you want me
to let them know

745
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:49,544
you won't be operating tomorrow?

746
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:50,812
I said no.

747
00:45:50,813 --> 00:45:52,346
Stop going on about it.

748
00:45:52,347 --> 00:45:54,515
That won't
be necessary, Matthew.

749
00:45:54,516 --> 00:45:56,417
I'll come by in the morning,
I won't go into the clinic.

750
00:45:56,418 --> 00:45:58,319
I'll bring in those
doughnuts he loves so much.

751
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,191
Yes, I'm
sure he'll be thrilled.

752
00:46:54,543 --> 00:46:57,713
- Where were you?
- At Claire's.

753
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:01,515
Is Dad asleep?

754
00:47:01,516 --> 00:47:03,119
Yes.

755
00:47:04,387 --> 00:47:06,455
How's Bob?

756
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:07,656
Bob is absolutely fine.

757
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:11,560
They're just keeping
him in as a precaution.

758
00:47:12,128 --> 00:47:14,263
How are you feeling?

759
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:16,297
I'm fine, how do you mean?

760
00:47:16,298 --> 00:47:18,466
I mean are you tired?

761
00:47:18,467 --> 00:47:21,602
I'm absolutely fine.

762
00:47:21,603 --> 00:47:23,238
I'm a little tired, that's all.

763
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:24,374
Okay.

764
00:47:27,043 --> 00:47:28,643
See you in the morning.

765
00:47:28,644 --> 00:47:30,412
Oh, and while Bob
is in the hospital,

766
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:34,885
you'll be responsible for
watering the plants, okay?

767
00:47:46,262 --> 00:47:47,395
Did he go to the bathroom?

768
00:47:47,396 --> 00:47:48,596
Did he get up?

769
00:47:48,597 --> 00:47:50,198
He hadn't when I
passed by about an hour ago.

770
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:51,366
He didn't want to.

771
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:52,267
He didn't want to
pee or he hadn't gotten up?

772
00:47:52,268 --> 00:47:55,102
- He didn't want to pee.
- Could he get up?

773
00:47:55,103 --> 00:47:56,305
He was asleep.

774
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:59,341
I didn't want to
drag him out of bed.

775
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:03,678
Good morning, Doctor.

776
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:06,147
How are you, Mrs Murphy?

777
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:07,582
I came by to see Bob.

778
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:10,252
Kim told me what happened.

779
00:48:10,253 --> 00:48:11,319
Hi, Martin.

780
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,955
How nice of you.

781
00:48:15,724 --> 00:48:18,359
Did your friend Martin
come to see you?

782
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,593
I'll leave you alone now

783
00:48:19,594 --> 00:48:21,596
so you can spend some
time with him, too.

784
00:48:21,597 --> 00:48:23,364
I gotta go anyway.

785
00:48:23,365 --> 00:48:26,234
I'll come by and see him
again some other time.

786
00:48:26,235 --> 00:48:29,538
I offered to help him
go to the bathroom

787
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:32,306
but he didn't want me to.

788
00:48:32,307 --> 00:48:33,843
He wet the bed.

789
00:48:36,545 --> 00:48:39,480
I brought some lemonade
my mom made yesterday.

790
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:41,716
You should try some, let
me know what you think.

791
00:48:41,717 --> 00:48:44,752
Thank you very much.

792
00:48:44,753 --> 00:48:47,689
Darling, do you know
what's in this box?

793
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:48,589
What?

794
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:49,424
Cinnamon
doughnuts, that's what.

795
00:48:49,425 --> 00:48:53,095
Come to the
cafeteria upstairs.

796
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,763
Come whenever you can.

797
00:48:55,764 --> 00:48:56,631
I don't think
I'll have time today,

798
00:48:56,632 --> 00:48:58,165
as you might imagine.

799
00:48:58,166 --> 00:48:59,667
We'll talk some other time.

800
00:48:59,668 --> 00:49:02,770
No, today,
to the cafeteria.

801
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:07,443
Just for 10 minutes, don't
stand me up like the last time.

802
00:49:13,715 --> 00:49:16,283
I brought you a present.

803
00:49:16,284 --> 00:49:18,220
You've given me so many presents

804
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,388
and I've not given you anything.

805
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:23,625
I thought that was rude of me.

806
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:25,261
Close your eyes.

807
00:49:26,195 --> 00:49:28,498
Close your eyes, please.

808
00:49:30,032 --> 00:49:31,732
It's a Swiss Army knife.

809
00:49:31,733 --> 00:49:32,634
I shouldn't have told you that.

810
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:35,669
I just ruined the
surprise, I'm sorry.

811
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,671
Thank you very much, Martin.

812
00:49:37,672 --> 00:49:38,772
That was dumb.

813
00:49:38,773 --> 00:49:42,511
Martin, I have
to get back downstairs.

814
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:43,647
Okay.

815
00:49:44,646 --> 00:49:46,714
I won't keep you much
longer, even though

816
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:50,986
you have been devoting less
and less time to me lately.

817
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:55,156
I wanted to say one more thing,
I'm really sorry about Bob.

818
00:49:55,157 --> 00:49:56,758
- It's nothing serious.
- No, it is.

819
00:49:56,759 --> 00:50:00,529
That critical moment we both
knew would come some day?

820
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,430
Here it is.

821
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:03,332
That time is now.

822
00:50:05,735 --> 00:50:09,039
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

823
00:50:10,072 --> 00:50:12,774
Listen, Martin, I don't
have time for this.

824
00:50:12,775 --> 00:50:14,642
Okay, I'm gonna
explain this very quickly

825
00:50:14,643 --> 00:50:17,079
so that I don't hold you up.

826
00:50:18,847 --> 00:50:20,515
Yes, it's exactly
what you think.

827
00:50:20,516 --> 00:50:22,149
Just like you killed
a member of my family,

828
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,384
now you've gotta kill
a member of your family

829
00:50:23,385 --> 00:50:25,252
to balance things
out, understand?

830
00:50:25,253 --> 00:50:26,788
I can't tell you who
to kill, of course.

831
00:50:26,789 --> 00:50:28,790
That's for you to decide,
but if you don't do it,

832
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:30,658
they will all get sick and die.

833
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:33,428
Bob will die, Kim will
die, your wife will die.

834
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:35,163
They will all get sick and die.

835
00:50:35,164 --> 00:50:36,631
One, paralysis of the limbs.

836
00:50:36,632 --> 00:50:38,767
Two, refusal of food to
the point of starvation.

837
00:50:38,768 --> 00:50:40,768
Three, bleeding from
the eyes, four, death.

838
00:50:40,769 --> 00:50:41,870
One, two, three, four.

839
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:43,337
Don't worry, you won't get sick.

840
00:50:43,338 --> 00:50:46,709
You just gotta stay
calm, that's all.

841
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:51,580
There, I said it, as
quickly as I could.

842
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:54,818
I hope I haven't
kept you too long.

843
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,488
One more thing.

844
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:00,654
I'll be very quick.

845
00:51:00,655 --> 00:51:02,189
You only have a few days
to decide who to kill.

846
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,859
Once stage three kicks in...

847
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,896
You remember what
stage three is?

848
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:11,765
It's bleeding from the
eyes, that's stage three.

849
00:51:11,766 --> 00:51:13,468
Once the bleeding happens,

850
00:51:13,469 --> 00:51:17,171
it's only a matter of
hours before they die.

851
00:51:17,172 --> 00:51:19,540
Okay, there, I have
nothing more to say.

852
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:21,209
Unless you've,

853
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:23,847
unless you've any questions?

854
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:54,276
Has he eaten?

855
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,013
No, he's not hungry.

856
00:51:57,947 --> 00:52:00,181
What do you
mean he's not hungry?

857
00:52:00,182 --> 00:52:02,185
He's not hungry.

858
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:18,832
Come on,
darling, eat a doughnut.

859
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:21,870
- I don't want it, Dad.
- You do.

860
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:23,270
But you're afraid
your mother and I

861
00:52:23,271 --> 00:52:24,805
will tell you off
for eating doughnuts.

862
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:26,442
Come on, eat it.

863
00:52:26,976 --> 00:52:28,642
You have my permission.

864
00:52:28,643 --> 00:52:29,777
You have our permission.

865
00:52:29,778 --> 00:52:30,946
It's okay for him to eat a
doughnut, isn't it, Anna?

866
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:32,814
Yes, of course.

867
00:52:32,815 --> 00:52:35,549
You heard
your mother, eat it.

868
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:36,685
Bob?

869
00:52:40,922 --> 00:52:43,258
He doesn't want it.

870
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:45,794
- No, he'll eat it later.
- That's right.

871
00:52:46,996 --> 00:52:47,796
That's right, eat it.

872
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:49,997
Now chew it, swallow.

873
00:52:49,998 --> 00:52:50,931
Leave him alone!

874
00:52:50,932 --> 00:52:51,799
He said he doesn't want it now.

875
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,535
He's going to
eat them right now.

876
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:55,002
He's completely run down.

877
00:52:55,003 --> 00:52:56,238
That's why he keeps falling
over and crawling around

878
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,240
on all fours.

879
00:52:58,673 --> 00:52:59,841
He's going to eat
them, all of them.

880
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:04,513
Five minutes flat, I want
to see that whole box empty.

881
00:53:35,878 --> 00:53:41,158
That means, on the bus
there are winners and losers.

882
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:46,686
But it's funny because
it sounds like,

883
00:53:46,688 --> 00:53:50,759
on the bus there are
20 hearts and 20 asses.

884
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,460
That is funny.

885
00:53:59,702 --> 00:54:02,071
Are you on your period?

886
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:03,805
No.

887
00:54:06,675 --> 00:54:09,678
If you're hungry, we can
order something later.

888
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,346
My parents won't
be back till late

889
00:54:11,347 --> 00:54:14,582
and they've left me some money.

890
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:15,984
I'm not hungry.

891
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:55,091
You're the prettiest
girl I've ever met.

892
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:07,669
I have to go, I'm sorry.

893
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,069
Why?

894
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:10,939
Stay a little longer.

895
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,073
We can listen to some music.

896
00:55:13,074 --> 00:55:16,745
I can't,
it's late, I'm sorry.

897
00:55:19,514 --> 00:55:21,116
Are you mad at me
because of my dad?

898
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:24,386
Don't be stupid,
I'm not mad at you at all.

899
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:27,190
I thought I made myself clear.

900
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:31,926
I don't feel angry at
him, I feel sorry for him.

901
00:55:31,927 --> 00:55:34,763
I have to go because it's late.

902
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,964
It's as simple as that.

903
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:39,701
Don't be a drag, I
thought you understood.

904
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:41,502
I'm sorry, Martin.

905
00:55:41,503 --> 00:55:43,372
I love you so much.

906
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:27,482
He stopped eating today.

907
00:56:27,483 --> 00:56:29,285
He refuses to eat.

908
00:56:31,085 --> 00:56:33,087
Some of the tests
need to be done again.

909
00:56:33,088 --> 00:56:35,457
Take a deep breath.

910
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,957
Hold it for a few seconds.

911
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,158
They
haven't detected anything.

912
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:40,495
Okay, good, breathe.

913
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:42,529
It's been less than a
day since his last tests.

914
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:45,466
I don't think the results are
gonna show anything different.

915
00:56:45,467 --> 00:56:48,470
To be honest, I think
what we have here

916
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:52,105
is a clear case of some
psychosomatic disorder.

917
00:56:52,106 --> 00:56:55,810
I'm inclined
to agree with Anna.

918
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:57,044
Well
what do you mean?

919
00:56:57,045 --> 00:56:58,480
Shouldn't we rule out
all possible causes

920
00:56:58,481 --> 00:56:59,781
before we resort
to the easy option

921
00:56:59,782 --> 00:57:02,216
of a psychosomatic disorder?

922
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:06,488
We already have
ruled out everything else.

923
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,258
I think with
psychological support

924
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:12,660
and psychiatric
treatment, if necessary,

925
00:57:12,661 --> 00:57:14,229
he will be just fine.

926
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,598
He'll walk again
and he'll eat again.

927
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:18,933
Of course he will.

928
00:57:24,206 --> 00:57:25,806
Anna,

929
00:57:25,807 --> 00:57:27,008
if Bob was near-sighted,
or had a cataract

930
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:30,912
or glaucoma then your opinion
really would be valuable.

931
00:57:30,913 --> 00:57:33,814
But, thankfully, Bob's
eyesight is perfect.

932
00:57:33,815 --> 00:57:35,216
And I can honestly say that
if he ever needed glasses

933
00:57:35,217 --> 00:57:37,785
you'd be the first
person I'd consult.

934
00:57:37,786 --> 00:57:39,254
But right now the boy can't eat

935
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:41,122
and he's paralyzed in
both legs, so, I'm sorry,

936
00:57:41,123 --> 00:57:44,792
I'm not remotely interested
in your medical opinion.

937
00:57:44,793 --> 00:57:46,127
Doors opening.

938
00:57:47,762 --> 00:57:49,231
Doors opening.

939
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:56,472
Doors closing,
please stand clear.

940
00:58:18,193 --> 00:58:20,828
Come on, Bob,
let's go for a walk.

941
00:58:20,829 --> 00:58:23,199
Up you get, there you go.

942
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,434
Ready?

943
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:27,804
There we go.

944
00:58:47,623 --> 00:58:48,558
Bob?

945
00:58:53,795 --> 00:58:56,230
Why don't we play a game?

946
00:58:56,231 --> 00:58:57,064
What game?

947
00:58:57,065 --> 00:58:58,665
I'll
tell you a secret,

948
00:58:58,666 --> 00:58:59,267
something I've never
told you before.

949
00:58:59,268 --> 00:59:01,169
Then you'll tell me one.

950
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:05,207
And whoever tells the
best secret wins, okay?

951
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:10,845
When I was your age I'd only
just started masturbating.

952
00:59:10,846 --> 00:59:12,879
And I'd only just
started ejaculating.

953
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,017
Only a little, barely a drop.

954
00:59:16,018 --> 00:59:17,118
I was worried that I had
some kind of a problem

955
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:21,557
because at school I'd
heard all sorts of stories.

956
00:59:22,824 --> 00:59:26,060
Then one day, when my father
had had a lot to drink

957
00:59:26,061 --> 00:59:29,397
and my brothers were out and
he was sleeping in the bedroom,

958
00:59:29,398 --> 00:59:32,667
I crept inside, put
my hand on his penis

959
00:59:32,668 --> 00:59:36,638
and started stroking
it until he ejaculated.

960
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,640
The sheets were
covered in sperm.

961
00:59:39,641 --> 00:59:42,010
I got scared and ran out.

962
00:59:43,344 --> 00:59:47,015
I've never told
anyone that before.

963
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:50,785
Now it's your turn
to tell me a secret.

964
00:59:50,786 --> 00:59:52,754
I don't know.

965
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,355
I don't have one.

966
00:59:54,356 --> 00:59:56,290
That's impossible.

967
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:58,327
You have to have one.

968
00:59:59,293 --> 01:00:01,062
No.

969
01:00:01,063 --> 01:00:02,163
I don't.

970
01:00:02,164 --> 01:00:03,964
Bob, if all this is just
an act, you should know

971
01:00:03,965 --> 01:00:06,167
that if you tell me
now, I won't punish you.

972
01:00:06,168 --> 01:00:08,102
And neither will your mother.

973
01:00:08,103 --> 01:00:11,305
We won't be angry
with you either.

974
01:00:11,306 --> 01:00:12,939
It's not an act.

975
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,042
But if it is an act
and you don't stop

976
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,143
this stupid joke right now,

977
01:00:16,144 --> 01:00:19,346
your punishment won't just
be no TV for two months.

978
01:00:19,347 --> 01:00:21,716
I will take my electric razor

979
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:26,319
and I will shave your head
and make you eat your hair.

980
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:30,058
I mean it, I will literally
make you eat your hair.

981
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,993
I'm not kidding.

982
01:00:31,994 --> 01:00:33,996
It's not an act.

983
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:53,448
I brought you a clean shirt.

984
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:54,951
Thank you.

985
01:00:57,485 --> 01:00:59,621
Anything to tell me?

986
01:01:01,757 --> 01:01:02,692
Hungry?

987
01:01:04,326 --> 01:01:07,227
Want me to bring you
something to eat?

988
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:08,664
No, thank you.

989
01:01:09,864 --> 01:01:11,700
Maybe you were right.

990
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:14,901
Maybe it's all psychological.

991
01:01:14,902 --> 01:01:17,305
Everything will be
alright, you'll see.

992
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:18,441
Trust me.

993
01:01:19,407 --> 01:01:23,910
We're in this together,
it's all gonna be fine.

994
01:01:23,911 --> 01:01:25,812
Let's get you something
to eat, get some fresh air

995
01:01:25,813 --> 01:01:28,116
and go up and see
the little one.

Dad, I don't want any fruit.

1024

Just one bite.

1025
01:03:03,512 --> 01:03:04,847
For me.

1026
01:03:27,568 --> 01:03:29,502
I can't.

1027
01:03:29,503 --> 01:03:31,339
Okay.

1028
01:04:25,693 --> 01:04:27,162
Open the door!

1029
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:38,004
I know you're in there!

1030
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:43,276
Open the door or I
will smash it down!

1031
01:04:43,277 --> 01:04:44,412
Martin!

1032
01:04:46,614 --> 01:04:48,281
Open the door or I
will smash it down

1033
01:04:48,282 --> 01:04:52,754
and I will fuck you and your
mother just the way you wanted!

1034
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:00,560
If anything happens
to my kids or my wife,

1035
01:05:00,561 --> 01:05:02,495
you'll die in prison!

1036
01:05:02,496 --> 01:05:04,364
Do you know that?

1037
01:05:04,365 --> 01:05:06,401
You'll die in prison!

1038
01:05:18,045 --> 01:05:20,513
How old was
his father when he died?

1039
01:05:20,514 --> 01:05:22,450
46.

1040
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:24,317
Had you been
drinking that day?

1041
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:26,553
He had an arrhythmia,
a stroke, and that was it.

1042
01:05:26,554 --> 01:05:30,758
I asked whether you'd been
drinking, not how he died.

1043
01:05:30,759 --> 01:05:32,158
How long has this been going on?

1044
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:35,261
How long have you
been seeing this boy?

1045
01:05:35,262 --> 01:05:37,899
About six months.

1046
01:05:39,233 --> 01:05:41,401
- Where were you meeting?
- What does it matter?

1047
01:05:41,402 --> 01:05:42,502
Where were
you meeting him?

1048
01:05:42,503 --> 01:05:45,406
At a diner and then we'd
drive down to the river.

1049
01:05:45,407 --> 01:05:47,640
He's got issues, serious
psychological issues.

1050
01:05:47,641 --> 01:05:49,310
He always did.

1051
01:05:49,677 --> 01:05:50,777
I knew he acted weird sometimes

1052
01:05:50,778 --> 01:05:53,747
but now he's lost it completely,
he's become dangerous.

1053
01:05:53,748 --> 01:05:55,783
We have to take precautions.

1054
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:58,785
Go to the police and take
some precautionary measures.

1055
01:05:58,786 --> 01:06:00,254
We're not going to the police.

1056
01:06:00,255 --> 01:06:01,689
We're not telling
anyone about this.

1057
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:03,425
What's the point?

1058
01:06:05,659 --> 01:06:08,729
Had you been drinking when
you operated on his father?

1059
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:09,663
Only a little.

1060
01:06:09,664 --> 01:06:11,665
That had nothing to
do with the outcome.

1061
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,366
A surgeon never kills a patient.

1062
01:06:13,367 --> 01:06:14,801
An anesthesiologist
can kill a patient

1063
01:06:14,802 --> 01:06:16,569
but a surgeon never can.

1064
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:17,805
For example, Matthew
has made mistakes

1065
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:22,377
that have led to the death of
a patient, but I never have.

1066
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:28,783
Bob seemed a little
better today.

1067
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:33,055
He was in a better mood
and he was less pale.

1068
01:06:33,822 --> 01:06:38,091
Why didn't you tell
me you were seeing him?

1069
01:06:38,092 --> 01:06:40,060
At first I didn't
see him that often.

1070
01:06:40,061 --> 01:06:43,830
It was only recently that we
began meeting more regularly.

1071
01:06:43,831 --> 01:06:46,801
And I was going to
tell you at some point.

1072
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:49,270
I felt sorry for him.

1073
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:51,406
I gave him some money.

1074
01:06:52,206 --> 01:06:54,342
His mom's out of work.

1075
01:07:16,731 --> 01:07:20,134
Mom, when
are we going home?

1076
01:07:20,135 --> 01:07:21,634
Tomorrow,
or the day after,

1077
01:07:21,635 --> 01:07:25,538
when all of the tests are
done and the doctors say so.

1078
01:07:25,539 --> 01:07:28,808
But you're doctors, too.

1079
01:07:28,809 --> 01:07:31,312
Tell them we can go home.

1080
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:33,848
We'll
tell them, darling.

1081
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:36,850
Mom, did Martin come
by while I was sleeping?

1082
01:07:36,851 --> 01:07:38,354
No.

1083
01:07:39,253 --> 01:07:42,624
Can you turn me
on my side, please?

1084
01:07:58,572 --> 01:07:59,906
Is Dad here?

1085
01:07:59,907 --> 01:08:02,110
No, he'll be here soon.

1086
01:08:02,911 --> 01:08:04,712
Want me to get
some juice for you?

1087
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:05,546
No.

1088
01:08:05,547 --> 01:08:07,281
Don't go anywhere.

1089
01:08:07,282 --> 01:08:08,417
Stay here.

1090
01:08:18,693 --> 01:08:20,062
Good morning.

1091
01:08:21,262 --> 01:08:22,564
How are you?

1092
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:26,401
Aren't you coming by?

1093
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,404
Okay.

1094
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:30,603
Just my mom.

1095
01:08:30,604 --> 01:08:33,441
My father will be here soon.

1096
01:08:36,411 --> 01:08:37,512
You're here?

1097
01:08:38,813 --> 01:08:42,418
I can't, are you
coming up to see me?

1098
01:08:44,185 --> 01:08:48,456
You really
think that's possible?

1099
01:08:57,932 --> 01:09:00,201
Well let's see.

1100
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:01,437
Okay, okay.

1101
01:09:29,396 --> 01:09:31,033
Yes, I stood up.

1102
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:33,934
Can you see me?

1103
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:35,504
Yes, thank you.

1104
01:09:37,305 --> 01:09:39,639
Yeah, I'm standing
at the window.

1105
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,209
Can you see me?

1106
01:09:41,842 --> 01:09:43,479
I can't see you.

1107
01:09:45,012 --> 01:09:47,281
I'm waving at you.

1108
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:57,890
Mom?

1109
01:09:57,891 --> 01:09:59,893
I want to stand up like Kim.

1110
01:09:59,894 --> 01:10:02,328
How come she can
get up and I can't?

1111
01:10:02,329 --> 01:10:04,398
You'll be able
to soon, my darling.

1112
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:06,433
Kim's older than you,
that's why she can do it.

1113
01:10:06,434 --> 01:10:08,434
Soon you'll be strong
enough to stand up too.

1114
01:10:08,435 --> 01:10:10,903
Alright, I'm
going back to bed.

1115
01:10:10,904 --> 01:10:12,274
Mm hmm, me too.

1116
01:10:16,344 --> 01:10:17,279
Bye.

1117
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:22,015
Mom, I'm going
over to the window.

1118
01:10:22,016 --> 01:10:23,817
Oh!

1119
01:10:26,453 --> 01:10:27,588
No.

1120
01:10:42,804 --> 01:10:45,371
Who were you talking to?

1121
01:10:45,372 --> 01:10:46,040
Martin.

1122
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,442
He sends his regards.

1123
01:10:48,443 --> 01:10:50,943
I don't want you
talking to him ever again.

1124
01:10:50,944 --> 01:10:51,944
Why?

1125
01:10:51,945 --> 01:10:54,716
Because I said so.

1126
01:10:56,984 --> 01:10:58,751
Did you hear what I said?

1127
01:10:58,752 --> 01:10:59,954
Fuck you.

1128
01:11:00,822 --> 01:11:03,890
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

1129
01:11:03,891 --> 01:11:06,026
Yes, you did, what
did you say, Kim?

1130
01:11:06,027 --> 01:11:09,529
Mom, let go, you're hurting
me, I didn't say anything.

1131
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:10,997
I'm not like your father.

1132
01:11:10,998 --> 01:11:12,666
If this is the way you want it,

1133
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:16,370
I'm confiscating your phone,
right here, right now.

1134
01:11:16,371 --> 01:11:20,309
That'll teach you to
be rude to your mother.

1135
01:11:21,109 --> 01:11:22,843
Give me my phone back.

1136
01:11:22,844 --> 01:11:25,580
You can forget it.

1137
01:11:27,448 --> 01:11:29,883
Don't be scared, Mom.

1138
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:31,919
Don't get hysterical.

1139
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:35,054
It's not that tragic.

1140
01:11:35,055 --> 01:11:37,056
Sometimes your body
hurts from not moving

1141
01:11:37,057 --> 01:11:39,226
and you can't sleep.

1142
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:42,028
That's all.

1143
01:11:42,029 --> 01:11:43,663
The important thing
is to make sure

1144
01:11:43,664 --> 01:11:47,033
that everything you
need is within reach.

1145
01:11:47,034 --> 01:11:48,235
That's all.

1146
01:11:49,537 --> 01:11:50,772
You'll see.

1147
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,910
You won't be able
to move either.

1148
01:11:55,476 --> 01:11:57,913
But you'll get used to it.

1149
01:12:12,527 --> 01:12:14,127
I really saw it happen.

1150
01:12:14,128 --> 01:12:15,062
It was
just a coincidence.

1151
01:12:15,063 --> 01:12:16,529
How can it be a coincidence?

1152
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:18,131
How come neither of them
have been able to get up

1153
01:12:18,132 --> 01:12:19,399
and walk until now?

1154
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,666
Darling, listen to yourself.

1155
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:22,135
I saw it.

1156
01:12:22,136 --> 01:12:23,203
Okay, it just means
things are getting better.

1157
01:12:23,204 --> 01:12:26,407
That's all it means, that
Kim is getting better.

1158
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:28,575
Now please go home and
rest awhile, please.

1159
01:12:28,576 --> 01:12:30,778
They're not better;
they're worse.

1160
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:32,145
This afternoon
there'll be an emergency meeting

1161
01:12:32,146 --> 01:12:33,980
with the Medical Board.

1162
01:12:33,981 --> 01:12:35,114
Larry and I took the initiative

1163
01:12:35,115 --> 01:12:36,215
and invited two
outstanding specialists

1164
01:12:36,216 --> 01:12:39,519
from the Presbyterian
University Hospital of Columbia.

1165
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,054
And they already flew
in from New York.

1166
01:12:41,055 --> 01:12:42,822
I'm meeting them this afternoon

1167
01:12:42,823 --> 01:12:44,724
to brief them about the case.

1168
01:12:44,725 --> 01:12:46,193
One of them's actually
a personal friend

1169
01:12:46,194 --> 01:12:48,161
of the director, Dr. Farrington,
you must have heard of him.

1170
01:12:48,162 --> 01:12:50,163
He's the best there is when it
comes to paralytic disorders.

1171
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,363
Good afternoon.

1172
01:13:25,065 --> 01:13:27,368
Oh, thank you very much.

1173
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:30,237
I'd like to talk to you.

1174
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:32,773
I'm not gonna take
up much of your time.

1175
01:13:32,774 --> 01:13:34,241
Of course.

1176
01:13:34,242 --> 01:13:37,109
Um, I've only got 10 minutes
'cause I've gotta get to class.

1177
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:38,378
So, what's up?

1178
01:13:40,814 --> 01:13:44,084
My husband told me
about you and your father.

1179
01:13:44,085 --> 01:13:45,586
Oh, he did?

1180
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:48,921
Did he also tell
you about my mom?

1181
01:13:48,922 --> 01:13:50,124
- No.
- Oh.

1182
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,125
Sorry.

1183
01:13:52,126 --> 01:13:56,397
Maybe I'm not the one you
should, um, hear it from but, um

1184
01:13:57,599 --> 01:14:00,501
ever since your husband
killed my father,

1185
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:03,603
he's been flirting with my mom.

1186
01:14:03,604 --> 01:14:05,439
Constantly, flirting.

1187
01:14:09,911 --> 01:14:13,913
To be honest, she's got
feelings for him, too.

1188
01:14:13,914 --> 01:14:17,117
She thinks he's very nice hands.

1189
01:14:17,118 --> 01:14:19,886
Truth is, he has
beautiful hands.

1190
01:14:19,887 --> 01:14:24,025
All doctors have clean,
nice, beautiful hands.

1191
01:14:25,126 --> 01:14:28,127
So I told her, I said,
I've no problem with it

1192
01:14:28,128 --> 01:14:30,630
if you wanna go ahead.

1193
01:14:30,631 --> 01:14:34,935
I mean, he seems like a
nice guy, very nice guy.

1194
01:14:36,203 --> 01:14:39,440
And I don't wanna
get in the way of

1195
01:14:40,307 --> 01:14:43,676
her trying to get her
life back on track.

1196
01:14:43,677 --> 01:14:48,149
I'll be gone, I'll be gone in
a few years, I'll get a job.

1197
01:14:51,252 --> 01:14:55,322
If my husband made a mistake,
if out of negligence or,

1198
01:14:55,323 --> 01:14:57,325
I don't know what,

1199
01:14:58,659 --> 01:15:00,327
he caused this tragic
thing to happen,

1200
01:15:00,328 --> 01:15:03,663
I don't understand why I
should have to pay the price.

1201
01:15:03,664 --> 01:15:07,502
Why my children should
have to pay the price.

1202
01:15:11,204 --> 01:15:15,576
You know, not long after
my dad died, someone told me

1203
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:19,779
that I eat spaghetti the
exact same way he did.

1204
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:23,584
They said what an
extraordinary impression

1205
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:26,887
this fact had made on them.

1206
01:15:27,588 --> 01:15:29,656
Look at the boy, look
how he eats spaghetti.

1207
01:15:29,657 --> 01:15:32,826
Exactly the same
way his father did.

1208
01:15:32,827 --> 01:15:34,294
He sticks his fork in.

1209
01:15:34,295 --> 01:15:38,833
He twirls it around, around,
around, around, around.

1210
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:42,871
Then he sticks it in his mouth.

1211
01:15:45,305 --> 01:15:47,707
At that time, I thought
I was the only one

1212
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:50,042
who ate spaghetti that way.

1213
01:15:50,043 --> 01:15:51,812
Me and my dad.

1214
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:53,846
Later, of course, I found out

1215
01:15:53,847 --> 01:15:58,352
that everyone eats spaghetti
the exact same way.

1216
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:01,222
Exact same way, exact same way.

1217
01:16:03,291 --> 01:16:05,593
This made me very upset.

1218
01:16:06,327 --> 01:16:07,562
Very upset.

1219
01:16:08,695 --> 01:16:11,063
Maybe even, um, more upset

1220
01:16:11,064 --> 01:16:14,367
than when they told
me he was dead.

1221
01:16:14,368 --> 01:16:15,903
My dad.

1222
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:26,078
I don't know if what is
happening is fair, but

1223
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:29,215
it's the only thing
I can think of

1224
01:16:29,216 --> 01:16:31,519
that's close to justice.

1225
01:16:37,324 --> 01:16:39,960
Time's getting on, and if I'm
late for class I'm done for.

1226
01:16:42,063 --> 01:16:43,899
Have a good day.

1227
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,448
So I don't see any
reason for the children

1228
01:17:02,449 --> 01:17:04,850
to stay in the hospital.

1229
01:17:04,851 --> 01:17:05,685
You mean
you think you've done

1230
01:17:05,686 --> 01:17:07,555
everything you can?

1231
01:17:08,722 --> 01:17:11,358
Yes, Steven, I believe
we've done everything we can.

1232
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:12,826
I'm sorry, but if I was
running this hospital,

1233
01:17:12,827 --> 01:17:15,362
I'd feel like a complete
failure, a loser.

1234
01:17:15,363 --> 01:17:18,667
I wouldn't be able
to sleep at night.

1235
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:22,704
Goodnight, Anna.

1236
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:24,705
Goodnight, Ed.

1237
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:31,711
I suggest we sign the
release forms tomorrow

1238
01:17:31,712 --> 01:17:33,948
and they can go home.

1239
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:21,495
Were you the anesthesiologist
for Jonathan Lang?

1240
01:18:25,032 --> 01:18:26,233
Thank you.

1241
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:29,469
- Do you want...
- No, thank you.

1242
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:31,904
Who's Jonathan Lang?

1243
01:18:31,905 --> 01:18:34,273
Male, 46 years old.

1244
01:18:34,274 --> 01:18:38,645
Patient of Steven's, died
on the operating table.

1245
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,549
Anna, there
have been so many patients

1246
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:44,550
over the years, so
many operations.

1247
01:18:44,551 --> 01:18:48,756
I don't remember him,
unfortunately, I'm sorry.

1248
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:52,492
Can you find me his
file in the records

1249
01:18:52,493 --> 01:18:55,228
and show it to me, please?

1250
01:18:55,229 --> 01:18:59,532
I wanna see his medical
history and the cause of death.

1251
01:18:59,533 --> 01:19:03,170
I don't think that's
possible, I'm sorry, Anna.

1252
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:07,075
I can't just share
files from the hospital.

1253
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:10,078
Why do you need it?

1254
01:19:11,212 --> 01:19:12,347
Please.

1255
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:19,885
Look, I can't
give you the file

1256
01:19:19,886 --> 01:19:24,056
but I can tell you a couple
of things about the case.

1257
01:19:24,057 --> 01:19:27,027
I remember him now,
I put him under.

1258
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:28,228
But

1259
01:19:28,229 --> 01:19:30,531
what do I get in return?

1260
01:19:31,832 --> 01:19:33,265
What you didn't get
that day we came for lunch

1261
01:19:33,266 --> 01:19:34,735
at your house.

1262
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:37,405
When?

1263
01:19:39,506 --> 01:19:40,841
Now.

1264
01:19:45,246 --> 01:19:46,545
Had Steven been drinking?

1265
01:19:46,546 --> 01:19:47,447
Yes.

1266
01:19:47,448 --> 01:19:49,983
Can it be
considered his mistake?

1267
01:19:49,984 --> 01:19:51,218
Yes.

1268
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:53,953
It wasn't mine, that's for sure.

1269
01:19:53,954 --> 01:19:56,889
You know an anesthesiologist
is never to blame

1270
01:19:56,890 --> 01:19:59,859
for the bad outcome
of an operation.

1271
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:02,797
The surgeon is
always responsible.

1272
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,566
He'd had two drinks that morning

1273
01:20:06,567 --> 01:20:09,202
before we went in to prepare.

1274
01:20:09,203 --> 01:20:13,305
Luckily, no one else realized,
I was the only one that knew.

1275
01:20:13,306 --> 01:20:17,344
But, back then, that
wasn't exactly unusual.

1276
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:18,812
You know that.

1277
01:21:18,706 --> 01:21:20,208
Thank you.

1278
01:21:34,555 --> 01:21:36,925
This meat is delicious.

1279
01:21:40,094 --> 01:21:42,394
You were right, after all.

1280
01:21:42,395 --> 01:21:45,867
The children are
much better off here.

1281
01:21:46,734 --> 01:21:47,567
I was even thinking
we might take them

1282
01:21:47,568 --> 01:21:50,202
to the beach house
for a few days.

1283
01:21:50,203 --> 01:21:51,504
A little fresh air and
a change of scenery

1284
01:21:51,505 --> 01:21:53,540
might do us all good.

1285
01:21:56,609 --> 01:21:58,144
Do you know what
I've been craving?

1286
01:21:58,145 --> 01:21:59,614
Mashed potato.

1287
01:22:00,648 --> 01:22:03,885
Why don't you make
some tomorrow?

1288
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,755
You have beautiful hands.

1289
01:22:09,756 --> 01:22:12,459
I never noticed before.

1290
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:13,727
Everyone's been
telling me lately

1291
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:16,496
what beautiful hands you have
and now I can see for myself.

1292
01:22:16,497 --> 01:22:18,232
Nice and clean.

1293
01:22:18,666 --> 01:22:19,666
But so what if
they're beautiful?

1294
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:21,603
They're lifeless.

1295
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,636
Sometimes, Steven, you're
just an incompetent man

1296
01:22:24,637 --> 01:22:26,072
who goes on and on,

1297
01:22:26,073 --> 01:22:28,608
saying stupid things
like, "Let's do a scan.

1298
01:22:28,609 --> 01:22:30,777
"Let's do an ultrasound,
let's wear brown socks.

1299
01:22:30,778 --> 01:22:34,147
"Let's make mashed potatoes,
let's go to the beach house."

1300
01:22:34,148 --> 01:22:35,450
Excuse me?

1301
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:39,385
Our two children are dying
in the other room, but, yes,

1302
01:22:39,386 --> 01:22:41,653
I can make you mashed
potatoes tomorrow.

1303
01:22:41,654 --> 01:22:42,589
Please don't talk
to me that way.

1304
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:44,056
If you don't like
it, why don't you go

1305
01:22:44,057 --> 01:22:44,791
and live with Martin's mother?

1306
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:47,027
I bet she'll talk to you better.

1307
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:48,094
You wanted
the kids to come home,

1308
01:22:48,095 --> 01:22:50,029
and they came home.

1309
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:51,663
What else do you want me to do?

1310
01:22:51,664 --> 01:22:53,198
Something to put an
end to all of this,

1311
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:55,769
that's what I want;
can you do that?

1312
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:56,636
You do realize, Steven,

1313
01:22:56,637 --> 01:23:00,007
we're in this situation
because of you?

1314
01:23:02,176 --> 01:23:04,743
So what do you suggest?

1315
01:23:04,744 --> 01:23:06,280
Tell me.

1316
01:23:07,547 --> 01:23:10,450
No, wait, I know, I've got it.

1317
01:23:10,451 --> 01:23:12,751
There is a way we can
put a stop to all this.

1318
01:23:12,752 --> 01:23:15,688
All we need to do is find the
tooth of a baby crocodile,

1319
01:23:15,689 --> 01:23:17,756
the blood of a pigeon and
the pubes of a virgin.

1320
01:23:17,757 --> 01:23:19,826
And then we just have to
burn them all before sunset.

1321
01:23:19,827 --> 01:23:23,563
Let me see, do we have any
spare teeth lying around?

1322
01:23:23,564 --> 01:23:25,064
Teeth, pubes?

1323
01:23:25,065 --> 01:23:26,800
Nope, nothin' here.

1324
01:23:27,734 --> 01:23:29,402
There's nothing in here either.

1325
01:23:29,403 --> 01:23:31,103
Let me see, nothing here.

1326
01:23:31,104 --> 01:23:32,506
Pubes, teeth?

1327
01:23:34,707 --> 01:23:37,644
Nothing in this box either.

1328
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:38,778
Where are they?

1329
01:23:38,779 --> 01:23:41,547
I'm sure they were here
earlier, I put them here myself.

1330
01:23:41,548 --> 01:23:42,749
Who's been moving things around?

1331
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:44,716
It's unbelievable.

1332
01:23:44,717 --> 01:23:46,185
I don't suppose you've
got any pubes I can have,

1333
01:23:46,186 --> 01:23:47,821
by any chance?

1334
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:49,822
Oh, I forgot, you
don't have any left.

1335
01:23:49,823 --> 01:23:53,660
We don't have any of
the things we need.

1336
01:23:55,796 --> 01:23:58,264
There's no need for us to argue.

1337
01:23:58,265 --> 01:23:59,832
Everything's so
difficult already.

1338
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:02,869
There's no point
making it worse.

1339
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:08,407
If he was telling the truth,
wouldn't you be sick too?

1340
01:24:08,408 --> 01:24:10,710
Wouldn't you be
paralyzed already?

1341
01:24:10,711 --> 01:24:12,812
How do you explain that?

1342
01:24:12,813 --> 01:24:14,480
Yes, you're right.

1343
01:24:14,481 --> 01:24:16,448
Let's wait a little longer
until we're all dead

1344
01:24:16,449 --> 01:24:17,884
and then see what
you can do about it.

1345
01:24:17,885 --> 01:24:21,356
There's really nothing
to worry about.

1346
01:24:28,261 --> 01:24:29,828
You need to go to
the hospital tomorrow

1347
01:24:29,829 --> 01:24:31,898
and pick up more feeding
formula for the children.

1348
01:24:31,899 --> 01:24:33,265
We're almost out.

1349
01:24:33,266 --> 01:24:34,901
Okay.

1350
01:25:29,422 --> 01:25:30,824
Good morning.

1351
01:25:32,792 --> 01:25:34,861
Good morning.

1352
01:25:34,862 --> 01:25:37,932
Did
you get any sleep?

1353
01:25:38,932 --> 01:25:40,935
What time is it?

1354
01:25:42,802 --> 01:25:44,538
Ten past eight.

1355
01:25:48,975 --> 01:25:52,180
Get up and come with
me for a moment.

1356
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:34,786
You remember Martin, don't you?

1357
01:26:34,787 --> 01:26:36,355
He came by for a play-date.

1358
01:26:36,356 --> 01:26:38,657
I told him the kids were
feeling a little unwell

1359
01:26:38,658 --> 01:26:42,929
and he'll have to stay
here until they get better.

1360
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:44,930
Anna, go upstairs and make
him some of that lemonade

1361
01:26:44,931 --> 01:26:47,899
he likes so much, would you?

1362
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:51,204
I'll stay here and
keep him company.

1363
01:26:52,305 --> 01:26:53,240
Please.

1364
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:06,519
Let me go.

1365
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:09,054
My mother's gonna
be worried sick.

1366
01:27:09,055 --> 01:27:11,758
Do you think your mother's
proud of you, Martin?

1367
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:15,928
Do you think she's happy that
her beloved son is a murderer?

1368
01:27:15,929 --> 01:27:17,298
Murderer?

1369
01:27:18,599 --> 01:27:21,067
There's really no need
for such a dramatic,

1370
01:27:21,068 --> 01:27:23,935
sensational, old-fashioned word.

1371
01:27:23,936 --> 01:27:25,739
But if you insist,

1372
01:27:26,606 --> 01:27:28,741
the murderer, both
in my father's case

1373
01:27:28,742 --> 01:27:32,146
and our current
situation, is not me.

1374
01:27:32,945 --> 01:27:34,813
- Stop talking.
- Don't you understand

1375
01:27:34,814 --> 01:27:36,014
that you're wasting time?

1376
01:27:36,015 --> 01:27:38,550
And you don't have
much time left.

1377
01:27:38,551 --> 01:27:40,519
I said stop talking.

1378
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:44,323
Steven, it's gonna be
better once it's done.

1379
01:27:44,324 --> 01:27:46,627
Start over, clean slate.

1380
01:27:47,461 --> 01:27:49,196
Don't you get it?

1381
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:52,764
Sometimes I think you're
naive but you can't be naive.

1382
01:27:52,765 --> 01:27:55,934
You're a man of science,
you can't be an idiot.

1383
01:27:55,935 --> 01:27:57,703
But, if I'd only just met you,

1384
01:27:57,704 --> 01:28:00,706
I would seriously question
your depth of judgment.

1385
01:28:05,845 --> 01:28:09,614
I just want, want to show
you an example, ,

1386
01:28:09,615 --> 01:28:10,818
that's all.

1387
01:28:11,851 --> 01:28:16,156
Just one little example
to show you what I mean.

1388
01:28:24,030 --> 01:28:26,499
Should I apologize?

1389
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:27,635
No.

1390
01:28:28,801 --> 01:28:31,036
Should I, should I
stroke your wound?

1391
01:28:31,037 --> 01:28:33,473
Actually, that would
probably hurt even more,

1392
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
touching an open wound.
No, there's only one way
to make you and me
both feel better.

1393
01:28:56,563 --> 01:28:58,464
Do you understand?

1394
01:28:58,465 --> 01:29:00,267
It's metaphorical.

1395
01:29:01,033 --> 01:29:02,269
My example.

1396
01:29:02,935 --> 01:29:04,372
It's a metaphor.

1397
01:29:05,671 --> 01:29:07,073
I mean, it's,

1398
01:29:08,942 --> 01:29:10,410
it's symbolic.

1399
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:35,067
Shut the door, Anna.

1400
01:29:35,068 --> 01:29:37,903
Now, Martin, you'll know
what it's like to die.

1401
01:29:37,904 --> 01:29:39,071
What it's like when
your head cracks open

1402
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,139
and your brains blow out.

1403
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:41,139
Don't shoot him.

1404
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:42,175
And then?

1405
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:43,443
Shut up!

1406
01:29:43,444 --> 01:29:45,211
Shoot me, then what?

1407
01:29:45,212 --> 01:29:47,447
- Answer.
- I'll bury you in the yard!

1408
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:49,448
And you'll rot, that's what.

1409
01:29:49,449 --> 01:29:51,082
You won't be
able to explain it.

1410
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:53,085
You won't understand how
it could have happened.

1411
01:29:53,086 --> 01:29:56,121
You'll say, "But I
only killed one person.

1412
01:29:56,122 --> 01:29:58,056
"How come four people are dead?

1413
01:29:58,057 --> 01:30:00,059
"I only shot one."

1414
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:02,194
So if you're gonna dig
a hole in the yard,

1415
01:30:02,195 --> 01:30:04,764
better make it a big one.

1416
01:30:04,765 --> 01:30:05,831
Steven.

1417
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:39,800
He didn't kill him.

1418
01:30:40,634 --> 01:30:42,201
How do you know?

1419
01:30:42,202 --> 01:30:43,504
I just do.

1420
01:30:45,005 --> 01:30:48,075
Anyway, he made
the right choice.

1421
01:30:49,176 --> 01:30:50,776
Otherwise it would have been
like killing four people

1422
01:30:50,777 --> 01:30:52,480
with a single shot.

1423
01:30:53,947 --> 01:30:56,249
Wouldn't that be tragic?

1424
01:30:58,952 --> 01:31:01,756
I'm going to live with Martin.

1425
01:31:03,689 --> 01:31:06,893
I want you to know that
I'm really sorry, Bob.

1426
01:31:06,894 --> 01:31:08,894
I really love you.

1427
01:31:08,895 --> 01:31:10,029
We all do.

1428
01:31:10,997 --> 01:31:12,999
Dad does, too.

1429
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,533
But he's in a really
difficult position

1430
01:31:14,534 --> 01:31:17,068
and he doesn't have
much of a choice.

1431
01:31:17,069 --> 01:31:20,473
It's not because he
doesn't love you.

1432
01:31:21,207 --> 01:31:23,810
They bought me a piano.

1433
01:31:26,313 --> 01:31:29,816
Mom told me it'd
be here next month.

1434
01:31:31,284 --> 01:31:35,522
They didn't tell you so
you wouldn't be scared.

1435
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:43,629
Bob, something terrible
happened yesterday.

1436
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:47,368
I lost the MP player
that Martin gave me.

1437
01:31:48,268 --> 01:31:51,036
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

1438
01:31:51,037 --> 01:31:55,108
I've lost two MP players
in the last 10 days.

1439
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:58,812
So I'd like to ask you a favor.

1440
01:31:59,845 --> 01:32:03,316
Can I have your MP
player when you're dead?

1441
01:32:03,317 --> 01:32:04,884
Please, please.

1442
01:32:04,885 --> 01:32:06,020
Please.

1443
01:33:27,333 --> 01:33:28,636
Dad.

1444
01:33:29,435 --> 01:33:30,570
Look.

1445
01:33:33,673 --> 01:33:37,211
I cut my hair just
as you wanted me to.

1446
01:33:41,014 --> 01:33:42,216
Good boy.

1447
01:33:43,417 --> 01:33:44,551
Well done.

1448
01:33:45,418 --> 01:33:46,452
I'm sorry I
didn't listen to you

1449
01:33:46,453 --> 01:33:49,421
and get a haircut right away.

1450
01:33:49,422 --> 01:33:52,425
I don't know what I was
thinking all this time.

1451
01:33:52,426 --> 01:33:56,194
I would get so hot and have
to comb it all the time.

1452
01:33:56,195 --> 01:33:58,332
It was a total hassle.

1453
01:33:59,699 --> 01:34:02,468
I should have listened to
you and cut it off sooner.

1454
01:34:02,469 --> 01:34:04,437
I'm gonna water the plants now.

1455
01:34:04,438 --> 01:34:06,371
No, darling,

1456
01:34:06,372 --> 01:34:08,340
I watered them this morning.

1457
01:34:08,341 --> 01:34:09,643
Tomorrow.

1458
01:34:11,944 --> 01:34:13,079
Dad,

1459
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:15,413
I've been thinking about it

1460
01:34:15,414 --> 01:34:18,384
and I decided I wanna
become a cardiologist.

1461
01:34:18,385 --> 01:34:21,021
Not an ophthalmologist.

1462
01:34:21,887 --> 01:34:26,291
I lied to mom because I
didn't want her to get upset.

1463
01:34:26,292 --> 01:34:28,995
I think I prefer what you do.

1464
01:34:29,996 --> 01:34:33,499
It's far more interesting
and challenging.

1465
01:35:36,829 --> 01:35:40,099
The boy's very good
at math and physics.

1466
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:43,269
Kim, on the other hand, apart
from her natural aptitude

1467
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:47,473
for music, is very good
at literature and history,

1468
01:35:47,474 --> 01:35:50,475
areas in which Bob lags behind.

1469
01:35:50,476 --> 01:35:54,045
She wrote a brilliant essay
on the tragedy of Iphigenia

1470
01:35:54,046 --> 01:35:57,183
which she read out in class.

1471
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:59,518
She received an A plus.

1472
01:35:59,519 --> 01:36:02,854
What about their
behavior in class?

1473
01:36:02,855 --> 01:36:05,558
They're both a little
restless, I'd say.

1474
01:36:05,559 --> 01:36:06,760
Equally so.

1475
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:09,194
I mean, I've had the
occasional complaint

1476
01:36:09,195 --> 01:36:13,064
from their teachers about
some minor misdemeanors

1477
01:36:13,065 --> 01:36:16,501
but they've never been
rude to any of the staff.

1478
01:36:16,502 --> 01:36:19,839
In any case, if they
had ever acted out,

1479
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,907
we would have told you about it.

1480
01:36:22,908 --> 01:36:25,944
Do you especially like one
of them more than the other?

1481
01:36:25,945 --> 01:36:28,980
If you had to
choose between them,

1482
01:36:28,981 --> 01:36:31,618
which would say is the best?

1483
01:36:32,484 --> 01:36:35,288
That's a difficult question.

1484
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:40,427
I'm not sure I can
give you an answer.

1485
01:36:42,295 --> 01:36:43,696
I don't know.

1486
01:36:46,332 --> 01:36:49,135
I don't know what to tell you.

1487
01:38:04,109 --> 01:38:07,314
Thank you for
bringing them down.

1488
01:38:09,349 --> 01:38:12,483
I really wanted to see them.

1489
01:38:12,484 --> 01:38:15,254
I really wanted to see you.

1490
01:38:15,721 --> 01:38:17,190
Hi, Bob.

1491
01:38:18,257 --> 01:38:19,392
Hi, Kim.

1492
01:38:22,095 --> 01:38:23,230
Bob,

1493
01:38:24,396 --> 01:38:28,733
aren't you gonna come over
and let me give you a hug?

1494
01:38:28,734 --> 01:38:30,336
Bob?

1495
01:38:31,637 --> 01:38:32,972
No?

1496
01:38:34,606 --> 01:38:38,109
I understand; it doesn't matter.

1497
01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:39,512
You're a man.

1498
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:45,551
The man of the house, now
your father isn't home.

1499
01:38:46,185 --> 01:38:48,387
You can go back to bed.

1500
01:38:50,256 --> 01:38:53,627
Don't trouble
yourselves for my sake.

1501
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:57,296
You can take them away.

1502
01:39:49,649 --> 01:39:54,321
Anna, if you're gonna do
something, you'd better be fast.

1503
01:39:56,122 --> 01:39:58,425
The boy is about to die.

1504
01:41:36,389 --> 01:41:38,523
I believe the most logical
thing, no matter how harsh

1505
01:41:38,524 --> 01:41:40,791
this may sound, is
to kill a child.

1506
01:41:40,792 --> 01:41:42,861
Because we can
have another child.

1507
01:41:42,862 --> 01:41:45,496
I still can and you can.

1508
01:41:45,497 --> 01:41:49,969
And if you can't, we can try
IVF, but I'm sure we can.

1509
01:42:01,346 --> 01:42:04,215
I'm sorry for
what I did tonight.

1510
01:42:04,216 --> 01:42:07,219
I don't know what
I was thinking.

1511
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:10,621
I was only thinking about
myself and no one else.

1512
01:42:10,622 --> 01:42:12,691
That was wrong of me.

1513
01:42:14,493 --> 01:42:16,430
I was frightened.

1514
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:20,566
I shouldn't have been.

1515
01:42:23,203 --> 01:42:25,571
Let me be the one who
atones for your sins, Dad.

1516
01:42:25,572 --> 01:42:26,971
Kill me right here
in front of your eyes

1517
01:42:26,972 --> 01:42:28,473
so that you can be
sure that I die,

1518
01:42:28,474 --> 01:42:31,410
in case some fate spares
me at the last moment.

1519
01:42:31,411 --> 01:42:32,911
Kill me right here
in front of you

1520
01:42:32,912 --> 01:42:35,781
and leave me with the ultimate
joy of saving my own mother

1521
01:42:35,782 --> 01:42:39,151
and beloved brother
from certain death.

1522
01:42:49,729 --> 01:42:51,429
Mom, tell him.

1523
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:52,731
Dad, please.

1524
01:42:53,332 --> 01:42:55,233
I would do anything for you.

1525
01:42:55,234 --> 01:42:59,438
I would even die for you and
here's my chance to prove it.

1526
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:01,540
They're all asleep.

1527
01:43:02,007 --> 01:43:05,844
We can go now and
no one will notice.

1528
01:43:05,845 --> 01:43:09,583
All you have to do is
help me walk again.

1529
01:43:10,716 --> 01:43:14,952
My legs hurt after all
this time and I feel weak.

1530
01:43:14,953 --> 01:43:16,755
But it's okay.

1531
01:43:16,756 --> 01:43:18,558
It doesn't matter.

1532
01:43:19,993 --> 01:43:21,693
I knew at some point
this would all be over

1533
01:43:21,694 --> 01:43:23,295
and you would come.

1534
01:43:30,770 --> 01:43:32,536
I thought we could take
your friend's motorcycle

1535
01:43:32,537 --> 01:43:34,939
and run away together.

1536
01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:38,544
But you have to
make me well first.

1537
01:43:40,313 --> 01:43:42,447
I'll untie you if you promise
you can make me better

1538
01:43:42,448 --> 01:43:44,849
and we'll run away together.

1539
01:43:44,850 --> 01:43:45,985
Okay?

1540
01:43:52,925 --> 01:43:54,660
It's not working.

1541
01:43:55,528 --> 01:43:57,731
You have to try harder.

1542
01:43:58,864 --> 01:44:01,100
Kim's not in her bed.

1543
01:44:03,069 --> 01:44:06,804
I'm telling you, you
have to try harder.

1544
01:44:06,805 --> 01:44:08,173
Are you deaf?

1545
01:44:08,975 --> 01:44:10,110
Martin.

1546
01:44:10,676 --> 01:44:11,676
Try harder!

1547
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:37,435
- Where is she?
- She's gone.

1548
01:44:38,671 --> 01:44:41,841
Where is she, what
did you do to her?

1549
01:44:54,787 --> 01:44:57,922
I love you so much,
don't forget that.

1550
01:44:57,923 --> 01:44:59,758
You gave me life
and you, only you,

1551
01:44:59,759 --> 01:45:02,126
have the right to
take my life away.

1552
01:45:02,127 --> 01:45:04,730
That makes perfect sense.

1553
01:45:06,498 --> 01:45:08,532
You are my lords, my masters
and I am just someone

1554
01:45:08,533 --> 01:45:11,337
who lives to obey your wishes.

1555
01:45:17,409 --> 01:45:19,077
I love you so much.

1556
01:45:19,078 --> 01:45:20,978
Remember that when
I'm lying in my grave,

1557
01:45:20,979 --> 01:45:24,216
unable to tell you
that I love you.

1558
01:45:25,083 --> 01:45:26,417
I love you more than
anything in the world,

1559
01:45:26,418 --> 01:45:28,288
you and my brother.

1560
01:45:53,845 --> 01:45:56,148
Where have you been?

1561
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:57,849
I went
to the hospital.

1562
01:45:57,850 --> 01:46:00,153
Got the feeding formula.

1563
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,053
Have you checked on him?

1564
01:46:02,054 --> 01:46:05,158
Did you give him the sedatives?

1565
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:07,059
I let him go.

1566
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:11,496
- What are you talking about?
- He's not downstairs.

1567
01:46:11,497 --> 01:46:12,665
I let him go.

1568
01:46:16,435 --> 01:46:18,704
Why would you do that?

1569
01:46:19,738 --> 01:46:21,939
Why did you let him go?

1570
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,075
Answer me!

1571
01:46:23,676 --> 01:46:26,046
Are you a complete idiot?

1572
01:46:28,213 --> 01:46:30,816
It's not gonna make
any difference, Steven.

1573
01:46:30,817 --> 01:46:35,221
It's not gonna solve
anything, we both know that.

1574
01:47:07,686 --> 01:47:08,821
Mom?

1575
01:47:09,521 --> 01:47:10,755
Do you remember that day

1576
01:47:10,756 --> 01:47:14,024
when I was rude to
you at the hospital?

1577
01:47:14,025 --> 01:47:15,827
Yes.

1578
01:47:15,828 --> 01:47:17,895
Did you tell Dad about it?

1579
01:47:17,896 --> 01:47:21,868
Of course I
told him about it, Kim.

1580
01:47:22,969 --> 01:47:24,870
I didn't mean it, Mom.

1581
01:47:24,871 --> 01:47:27,505
Maybe it was just a side-effect
of the drugs or something.

1582
01:47:27,506 --> 01:47:30,776
Kim, can
you please be quiet?

1583
01:47:33,613 --> 01:47:36,547
Do your legs hurt,
do they feel numb?

1584
01:47:36,548 --> 01:47:40,186
Does your back hurt,
has it started yet?

1585
01:48:43,582 --> 01:48:44,516
Dad!

1586
01:48:45,251 --> 01:48:47,352
Quick, Bob's dying!

1587
01:48:49,354 --> 01:48:50,889
Dad!

1588
01:48:52,024 --> 01:48:53,326
Bob's dying!

1589
01:49:00,932 --> 01:49:02,068
Dad.

1590
01:49:03,769 --> 01:49:06,304
Who's your best friend?

1591
01:49:06,305 --> 01:49:08,473
I don't know, Bob.

1592
01:49:14,747 --> 01:49:16,281
I have three.

1593
01:49:17,216 --> 01:49:20,186
Two boys and a girl in my class.

1594
01:49:20,819 --> 01:49:22,588
That's great, Bob.

1595
01:49:24,189 --> 01:49:27,392
It's good to have
a lot of friends.

1596
01:49:59,324 --> 01:50:01,627
Bob's eyes are bleeding.

1597
01:50:04,329 --> 01:50:06,898
Come to the living room.

1598
01:50:06,899 --> 01:50:08,301
- Now?
- Yes.

1599
01:50:10,002 --> 01:50:11,137
Now.

1600
01:50:14,006 --> 01:50:16,907
Steven, where
are the children?

1601
01:50:16,908 --> 01:50:19,211
They're already there.

1602
01:50:29,188 --> 01:50:33,825
I think I'm gonna wear that
black dress that you like.

1603
01:50:33,826 --> 01:50:36,227
Wear whatever you want.

1604
01:50:36,228 --> 01:50:37,430
Just hurry.

1605
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1606
01:56:45,804 --> 01:56:50,804
