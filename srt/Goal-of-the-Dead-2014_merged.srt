1
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:23,405
Fuck you!

2
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:56,507
Something weird's going on.

3
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:00,601
Some kind of riot.

4
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:02,596
They're burning cars.

5
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,625
Given the refereeing, no wonder.

6
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:10,619
GOAL OF THE DEAD

7
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,405
FIRST HALF

8
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:19,407
Sam, what's your town called again?

9
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,262
Caplongue.

10
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:24,109
It hasn't been my town for ages.

11
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:36,036
First result for Paris,

12
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:39,602
Who move up the table below Evian.

13
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:42,939
Suprised, Herve?
They made an awful start,

14
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:44,419
well below par.

15
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:47,925
So far this year, it's a disgrace.

16
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:49,868
In my case, tonight,

17
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:53,252
no worries for Olympique,
it's a cup game

18
00:02:53,252 --> 00:02:55,432
against amateurs Caplongue.
An easy draw.

19
00:02:55,432 --> 00:02:58,144
Not so sure.
There's still a bit of history.

20
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:02,833
The Clubs met 17 years ago and who
was the Caplongue star? Samuel Lorit.

21
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,894
Lorit, the club's oldest player
bought from Caplongue

22
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:10,155
after his brilliant performances
at the time.

23
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,478
Caplongue, weird.

24
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:18,005
CAPLONGUE

25
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:22,747
Testing, testing, can you hear me?

26
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:25,034
Now? OK.

27
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:27,315
1, 2, yes? Right...

28
00:03:37,232 --> 00:03:41,649
See the return of local boy,
Samuel Lorit!

29
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:47,550
Tonight, feel the heat at Lagrippe!
Hip, hip, hip!

30
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,788
LAGRIPPE STADIUM

31
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,741
Paris had a tough start to the season,

32
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,244
and have struggled
to get top players.

33
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:06,964
They have young star Idriss Diago
but he can't do it all.

34
00:04:06,964 --> 00:04:07,956
As they say,

35
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,586
a great #10 doesn't make a team.
Coubert's smart,

36
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:16,273
because he has few choices.
He only has kids in defence.

37
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:17,958
Up front, it's all old men.

38
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,291
At least Diago's been rested.
Credit for that.

39
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:23,680
Calm down!

40
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,174
- Whatever!
- It's all bullshit!

41
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:28,030
Don't listen to them.

42
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,032
Journalist just try
and stir up tension.

43
00:04:31,032 --> 00:04:32,814
They have got a point.

44
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,171
Idriss, turn it off.

45
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:38,753
I'd quite like to see
Paris in league 2.

46
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:50,016
I told you,
studs on in the changing room!

47
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:51,787
What?

48
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,875
Guys, you have to step up
your French.

49
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,793
You've been here 2 months
and you can't say hello.

50
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:02,629
Can't understand a word.

51
00:05:04,227 --> 00:05:05,575
Cochini? What hell!

52
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:10,093
The woman following the team
this weekend is our ray of sunshine,

53
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,590
Solene Bellanger.

54
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,566
The game's not live,

55
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:14,984
but you'll be there

56
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:17,023
filling us in.

57
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:20,106
I'm using this low-pressure game
to get to know

58
00:05:20,106 --> 00:05:22,642
Olympique's star, Idriss Diago,

59
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:24,626
His interests, his hopes,
and his past.

60
00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:26,257
His past? He's only 12.

61
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:28,930
As for Samuel Lorit,

62
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,126
He's probably playing one of his last
premier league games.

63
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:35,466
No! What a great loss for soccer!

64
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:20,189
DR.BELVAUX, MD

65
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:20,444
SAM LORIT
Return of a local hero

66
00:07:27,105 --> 00:07:28,948
Time for the magic potion!

67
00:07:31,528 --> 00:07:34,924
You got to focus on your goal today.

68
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:38,216
And that goal is?

69
00:07:40,651 --> 00:07:43,237
- Win the match.
- Of course,

70
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:44,229
But above all?

71
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,080
Revenge, Jeannot!
We've waited ages for this day.

72
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:52,882
I dunno, Pop.
It was along time ago.

73
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:54,301
Don't back down now.

74
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:08,716
I knew it wouldn't be much fun
doping you up.

75
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:19,737
There.

76
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:26,844
Martine! Get that?

77
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:34,131
I'll be right there. Alright.

78
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:05,537
Kill Sam Lorit!

79
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:08,260
Sam!

80
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:10,835
Motherfucker!

81
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:36,771
Asshole! Dickwad! Fucker!

82
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:40,851
I'll pull off your dick
and fuck you in the eye.

83
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:43,959
Jizz-eating Parisian gay-boy!

84
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:45,586
I'll kill you!

85
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:55,776
Jeannot?

86
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,276
Is it rolling, Fred? Let's start.

87
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:15,447
So, Idriss,
you're a key player in this team.

88
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,432
Are you still happy at club?

89
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:22,487
To be honest,
not to be a drag or anything,

90
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:24,464
I can't answer without my agent.

91
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:26,237
It's a contractual thing.

92
00:10:28,624 --> 00:10:31,567
Would say you're the driving force
in the team?

93
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:36,937
Yeah, maybe.
I try to help the team, you know?

94
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:46,027
Do you have any role models,
any references?

95
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:51,102
Yeah, sure, I do have one.

96
00:10:52,121 --> 00:10:55,807
It's kind of down to him that I wanted
to play soccer.

97
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:58,208
As a kid, when I saw his videos,
I was like, wow!

98
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:02,819
I tried to do the same moves,
I tried to run like him.

99
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:05,279
I try to copy his technique.

100
00:11:06,117 --> 00:11:08,660
The was head the ball,
I try to do the same.

101
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,461
He was a real model for me.

102
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,942
He was the one who made me
want to do this job.

103
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:16,065
But I can't say who,
it's a brand thing.

104
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:22,319
You have to dominate.
Journalism is a battle.

105
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:24,149
You're giving in.

106
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,316
Idriss, Idriss?

107
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:31,687
Next season's coming up,
have any foreign clubs been in touch?

108
00:11:33,115 --> 00:11:36,434
Didn't you hear? I said
I can't answer without my agent.

109
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:37,709
What's this about?

110
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:40,708
It's a sort of introspective look...

111
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,481
I don't do introspective.

112
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:09,266
He's a footballer, use your charm.

113
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,191
- Thanks for the tip.
- Sure.

114
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,966
Patricia?

115
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,461
Patricia's the one with big tits.
I'm Solene.

116
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:18,169
OK, hello.

117
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:28,059
Exuse me. I wanted to say,
I'm fully available.

118
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,711
- For?
- The introspection thing.

119
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:34,715
I'm in the middle of it,
going back home after all these years.

120
00:12:34,715 --> 00:12:36,748
Cute, he's gonna see mom,
the farmer.

121
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:39,909
What's your problem?
Want some?

122
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,351
Sorry! You OK?

123
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:55,403
What was that?

124
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:06,144
I didn't see a thing.

125
00:13:07,238 --> 00:13:09,743
Whatever it was, we hit it.

126
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:15,860
Too high for a wild boar.

127
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:19,183
More like a stag, but a big one!

128
00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:20,317
Could be, but...

129
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,829
Where is it, then?

130
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:29,748
It's gone away to die.
That's what they do.

131
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:33,027
Hey, coach!

132
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,930
- What's up Idriss?
- Pee stop, can we?

133
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,080
Use the bus WC.

134
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,775
No way,
the cameraman's stunk it out.

135
00:13:40,997 --> 00:13:42,330
Wait till we're there.

136
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,604
I can't boss.
I didn't go before we left.

137
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:46,802
- OK, but hurry.
- Right away.

138
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:48,838
Hey, coach!

139
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:50,398
- What?
- Can we pee?

140
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,020
OK, go on everyone, hurry up!

141
00:14:16,497 --> 00:14:21,922
CAPLONGUE
1 stadium, 765 seat, 4 ultras.

142
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:24,377
Teddy to Popeye, do you copy?

143
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:26,575
I'll call you later.
Have fun!

144
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:28,304
OK, copy that.

145
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:31,902
Say hi to Satanas 85 and Superwoman.

146
00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:34,758
Teddy, we're sick of your truckers!

147
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:36,648
Turn it off, it's so annoying.

148
00:14:36,648 --> 00:14:39,243
- Did you think about the words?
- Yeah.

149
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:40,270
Here.

150
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:41,936
Let's see,

151
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:45,524
Paris, capital city.
Paris, you're so shitty.

152
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:47,606
That's good. That say's it all.

153
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:51,171
Paris, capital city.
Paris, you're so shite!

154
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:53,542
They won't know what hi them!

155
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:56,058
Mum always said
you had a gift for writing.

156
00:14:56,058 --> 00:15:00,472
You're nothing without the Ivorian!

157
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,576
Isn't that racist?

158
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,849
Ivorian's not racist.
It's not like I said, black.

159
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,116
Anyway, Diago's not Ivorian,
he's Senegalese.

160
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:15,025
Senegalese is alright,
but Ivorian's borderline.

161
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:16,884
Not at all. It's the same thing!

162
00:15:16,884 --> 00:15:18,418
What rhymes with Senegalese?

163
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:22,317
The club's reputation is on the line.
We don't want bad press.

164
00:15:22,317 --> 00:15:24,971
We don't like Diago
because he's Parisian.

165
00:15:25,648 --> 00:15:29,246
It's a bit like you. Are you from
Paris or here? Who knows?

166
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:32,348
There's no doubt,
I'm from Caplongue.

167
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,309
- Remind me, where you born?
- Paris.

168
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,619
There you go.

169
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:39,054
What does that mean? Come on!

170
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:43,178
My Mum was in Paris
and went into labour. It was an accident.

171
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:44,765
You're a Parisian!

172
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:47,692
Hands off the Caplongue anthem.
You've not right.

173
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:51,187
Pitt, tell him to stop.
Am I from here or not?

174
00:15:51,187 --> 00:15:54,449
Michael, let's say today
is an iniation test.

175
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:58,264
To be sure you're one of us.
If you pass, you're in.

176
00:15:58,264 --> 00:15:59,523
All for one, Michael.

177
00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:02,758
If you ever cop out

178
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:05,984
to protect your Parisian buddies,

179
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:09,252
you know what to expect. Right?

180
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:12,497
No, we have to find something else.

181
00:16:12,497 --> 00:16:15,174
We've got to lose the Ivorian bit.

182
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,592
We need something

183
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,040
that'll knock them out.

184
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:24,267
- Will you let me take a look?
- No.

185
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:27,351
I'm really sorry.
That guy was really getting in my face.

186
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:29,653
No big deal.
Just a nose bleed.

187
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:31,444
Luckily.

188
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,765
Are we on for the interview?

189
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:38,951
Let's go Sam. Come on, guys!

190
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:40,569
I'm sorry!

191
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,164
- Come on. Galliano.
- Thanks, coach.

192
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:46,724
That's good, let's go.

193
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:49,981
Souleiman, let's go.

194
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:52,255
The Parks, come on.

195
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:59,133
You're really doing my head in.
Come on, lets go.

196
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,173
Yeah, OK, come on, hurry up.

197
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

198
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:35,253
Parisians, all virgins,
Caplongue, big schlong.

199
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,694
Nah, too complicated.
What we need is...

200
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:45,003
Paris! Paris! Fuck you!

201
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:50,466
Yeah, that works.
Classic, but effective.

202
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:52,225
Come on, let's do that.

203
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,347
Paris, Capital city,
Paris, you're so shitty.

204
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,727
Paris, city of light.
Paris, you're so shine.

205
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:07,358
Paris! Paris! Fuck you!

206
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:13,029
Paris! Paris! Fuck you!

207
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:23,013
Hello, gentlemen.

208
00:18:23,013 --> 00:18:25,566
- Hello, boss.
- Not boss, Captain.

209
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:29,831
So, are you Dingoes
cooking up trouble?

210
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:32,541
It's the Coyotes, boss.

211
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,952
And I just told you, it's Captain.

212
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:39,207
I can see you're prepared.

213
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:42,443
It'll end as bad as that Amiens match.

214
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,641
No way, we love the Parisians.

215
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:47,334
We even hang out wit one.
Michael's pure Parisian.

216
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,927
I'm not Parisian!

217
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,505
You were born there.

218
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,292
Captain, please don't start with that.

219
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:54,496
Popeye to Teddy,

220
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:56,841
we're counting on you
to kick things off!

221
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,931
Turn that off!
I told those things are banned.

222
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:05,844
And what's that there?

223
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,599
No, those are my flares.
For personal use.

224
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:11,242
- Lower the window.
- No, I can't.

225
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:13,866
You lot asked for this!
Stadium ban!

226
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:18,041
Anything but that!
We'll do whatever you want.

227
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,075
It's the best day of our lives!

228
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,544
Well, use it
to reflect on your existence.

229
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:25,835
I'm getting sick of soccer.

230
00:19:25,835 --> 00:19:28,711
A bunch of idiots
watching more idiots chasing a ball.

231
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:31,752
They shout and fight,
dont respect anything.

232
00:19:31,752 --> 00:19:34,105
If it was up to me, I'd ban it.

233
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:36,543
We've got our tickets so we're going.

234
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:39,166
I'll see security doesn't let you in.

235
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,937
That's not fair.

236
00:19:41,937 --> 00:19:45,269
What's that?
I say what's fair and what's not.

237
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:49,077
- Who's the law round here?
- You.

238
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:51,581
I can't hear you. Who's the law?

239
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:52,789
You're the law.

240
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:55,776
Right, I am the law.

241
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:58,049
Now get lost!

242
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:10,923
Asshole!

243
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,476
Bunch of little shits.

244
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,296
I'll get you.

245
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:24,010
TELEPHONE RELAY
12km from the city centre

246
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,544
There are 2 ways.
At home, I cook it in a pot.

247
00:20:26,544 --> 00:20:29,481
It's better in oven,
there's less juice.

248
00:20:29,481 --> 00:20:31,391
Do you put cream in it?

249
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:32,909
Never.

250
00:20:35,197 --> 00:20:37,737
- Beer?
- Yeah, beer.

251
00:20:47,822 --> 00:20:48,968
Shit!

252
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:03,729
I'm really sorry. You OK?

253
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,951
Yes, I'm fine.

254
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:06,659
So then,

255
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:11,080
Sam Lorit, going back home

256
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,336
seems like a moment to take stock.

257
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:18,150
That's going a bit far.
I've still got some miles left in me.

258
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,426
What will it feel like to be
back on the Caplongue pitch?

259
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:25,658
Well, it's...

260
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:26,650
How to put it?

261
00:21:28,298 --> 00:21:30,097
- Moving, right?
- Yeah.

262
00:21:30,097 --> 00:21:31,377
That's it.

263
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:35,458
Exactly, very moving.

264
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,313
Memories flooding back.

265
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:39,724
Your parents must be proud of you.

266
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,399
My Mum ran off when I was a kid,
and my dad...

267
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:46,003
He's gone.

268
00:21:47,384 --> 00:21:48,163
Gone where?

269
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,216
You know, gone. So to speak.

270
00:21:52,216 --> 00:21:53,705
Oh, right, he's dead.

271
00:21:55,478 --> 00:21:56,640
Yeah.

272
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:02,114
Do you think you'll move back
to Caplongue

273
00:22:02,939 --> 00:22:04,286
after so long away?

274
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:08,799
Of course,
I'm seriously thinking of moving back.

275
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,024
With my old friends, we could open
a restaurant and train the local kids.

276
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:15,284
- Really?
- Sure.

277
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:17,979
I'm just like anyone else,

278
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:21,764
I want a quiet life,

279
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:24,690
to raise my kids,
and be involved in my home town.

280
00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:29,094
I think my fame
could really help the place.

281
00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:35,185
BAR IN CAPLONGUE

282
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:37,458
TOILETS IN BAR IN CAPLONGUE

283
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,033
Well? Does it look real?

284
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:40,456
Yeah.

285
00:22:41,156 --> 00:22:43,780
All the player's wives have got them.

286
00:22:44,515 --> 00:22:45,719
I hadn't noticed.

287
00:22:46,662 --> 00:22:48,372
If my Mum saw it, she'd kill me.

288
00:22:50,677 --> 00:22:52,916
- You gonna sulk all night?
- I'm not sulking.

289
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:55,220
There's a coach-load of hot guys coming!

290
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:58,243
And you've got that crush on Lorit.

291
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,748
It's not a crush. Idon't give a shit!

292
00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:03,088
Really, you could make an effort.

293
00:23:05,223 --> 00:23:08,217
- Think Idriss will notice me?
- You're hard to miss.

294
00:23:08,217 --> 00:23:11,199
He's got such a great body and face.

295
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:13,977
He's young yet old.
There's only 5 years between us.

296
00:23:14,868 --> 00:23:17,483
Imagine if he kissed me,

297
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:20,286
or we made love.

298
00:23:20,286 --> 00:23:22,124
Footballer's wife is not a life.

299
00:23:22,124 --> 00:23:24,791
They're bored all day
while their guys play ball.

300
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:25,925
They don't work.

301
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,491
They get cheated on,
they must all be alcoholics.

302
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,450
It's great.

303
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:35,306
What if we can't get near them?

304
00:23:35,306 --> 00:23:37,888
Why are you such a downer?

305
00:23:37,888 --> 00:23:39,731
Lighten up, have some fun!

306
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:43,034
With a Mum like yours,
it's weird you're so...

307
00:23:43,034 --> 00:23:45,805
Or rather so not... You know.

308
00:23:48,238 --> 00:23:50,093
Where is she, anyway?

309
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:52,305
In Thailand with her new guy.

310
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,629
Cool!

311
00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:01,611
Remember when we used to dress
the same?

312
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:03,519
Excuse me for being feminime.

313
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:04,039
Right.

314
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:26,936
Who's this lot?

315
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:30,218
What a bunch of freaks!

316
00:25:30,218 --> 00:25:32,487
Damn, I haven't been vaccinated.

317
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:34,787
You're such a jerk.

318
00:25:36,062 --> 00:25:39,721
Caplongue! caplongue!

319
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:42,405
Jump if you're from Caplongue!

320
00:25:43,227 --> 00:25:45,738
Jump if you're from Caplongue!

321
00:26:18,914 --> 00:26:20,281
Sell out!

322
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:22,046
Sell out! Get lost!

323
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:24,710
Go home Lorit sell out!

324
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,797
Go home!

325
00:26:57,707 --> 00:26:58,808
How are you, buddy?

326
00:26:58,808 --> 00:27:02,587
We're going to destroy you.
We'll make you weep, out your ass.

327
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:03,862
You talking to me?

328
00:27:05,366 --> 00:27:07,139
- An autograph?
- No, get lost.

329
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:09,561
I like you.

330
00:27:11,707 --> 00:27:13,459
Idriss!

331
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:26,401
Sam, hey!

332
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:29,933
If you'd said,
we'd have gone in the back door.

333
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:32,344
I don't know what's got into them.

334
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:38,690
You stop here, I'm afraid.

335
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,716
No cameras while we're talking.
Clear?

336
00:27:41,716 --> 00:27:44,265
But I just have a question for Sam.

337
00:27:44,265 --> 00:27:46,598
What for? To upset him even more?

338
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,854
Hey, kiddo. It's a guy thing.

339
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:57,388
Smiles don't work. It takes balls.

340
00:27:57,388 --> 00:28:01,881
Well, Fred, kiddo,
that's not gonna happen.

341
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,651
Ok, so what do we do?

342
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:08,346
We'll profile the locals to keep busy.

343
00:28:09,474 --> 00:28:11,531
I was here 17 years ago

344
00:28:11,531 --> 00:28:14,651
for the game against Paris.
The French cup.

345
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:18,079
We were a whisker away from winning.

346
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,985
It was right down to the wire.

347
00:28:19,985 --> 00:28:23,389
Of course, we lost our striker.
Yes, Sam Lorit.

348
00:28:24,547 --> 00:28:25,855
It was something.

349
00:28:25,855 --> 00:28:28,195
He went to Paris, so obviously,

350
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:31,807
we were left with a bad taste
in our mouths

351
00:28:31,807 --> 00:28:34,381
because he lost us that match,
he really did.

352
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:37,304
He used to hit me, right there.
More than once.

353
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:39,791
He chased me too, but I liked him.

354
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:44,017
- You knew him well.
- I did, but that was in high school.

355
00:28:44,017 --> 00:28:46,316
- It leaves a mark.
- It does.

356
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:49,718
This is what Lorit's gonna get!
Take that!

357
00:28:49,718 --> 00:28:52,445
Bitter, yeah, you could say that.

358
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:54,254
He was very fit, even then.

359
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:56,387
He fucked everyone, anyway.

360
00:28:56,387 --> 00:28:59,713
- Very athletic.
- Don't lay it on too thick.

361
00:28:59,713 --> 00:29:02,878
- I'm talking sport with the lady.
- I think she gets it.

362
00:29:02,878 --> 00:29:05,101
Come on, Caplongue!

363
00:29:05,855 --> 00:29:08,969
Who's your best player
since Lorit left?

364
00:29:08,969 --> 00:29:10,736
Jeannot, he's a hard man.

365
00:29:10,736 --> 00:29:12,851
He's a man of his word.

366
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,403
Jeannot's worth 10 Lorits, 100 even.

367
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:17,049
He's a real man.

368
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:21,340
Lorit!

369
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,181
- Excuse me, sir.
- Not now.

370
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:27,280
- Are you supporting Caplongue tonight?
- He hasn't got time!

371
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,549
Just a question about Sam Lorit.

372
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,775
Go bother someone else.

373
00:29:45,225 --> 00:29:46,358
That'll do, cut.

374
00:29:48,707 --> 00:29:50,693
Wow, they really hate Lorit.

375
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:53,819
It's a good story.

376
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:57,437
Seems the guy deflowered all the girls
before leaving.

377
00:29:58,105 --> 00:30:01,468
And all the dads, brothers
and husbands are after him.

378
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:02,743
That's your story.

379
00:30:03,457 --> 00:30:04,307
Fascinating.

380
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,442
What do we do?

381
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:10,715
Come on.

382
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:20,605
Tonight at Lagrippe Stadium,
come and support

383
00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:22,803
your favourite team, Caplongue.

384
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:30,055
Lorit! Nice welcoming committee!

385
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,657
How come they love you so much?

386
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:37,104
- Can't you leave me alone?
- I like you too much.

387
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,610
OK, guys, let's focus.

388
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:48,734
There's no such thing as a minor game.

389
00:30:48,734 --> 00:30:50,445
This is huge for them.

390
00:30:50,445 --> 00:30:53,423
So no cruising out there,
I want action!

391
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:57,133
Listen to the instructions
and concentrate.

392
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:58,835
How can I help the team?

393
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:01,842
What can I do? Who's with me?

394
00:31:01,842 --> 00:31:04,970
That's what soccer's all about!
Simple as that.

395
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,983
Tonight, let's hear
the Lagrippe faithful. Hip, hip!

396
00:31:07,983 --> 00:31:09,746
Hooray!

397
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:11,687
I'm so exited!

398
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:13,838
- You OK?
- Fine.

399
00:31:17,195 --> 00:31:17,974
OK, Joao,

400
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,148
solid.

401
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:23,780
Xavier, up front, feed your partner.

402
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,624
Souleiman, you're to soft.

403
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:29,801
Asem, same as last time,

404
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:33,014
only better!

405
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:36,559
You Parks, move up quick
and support the wingers.

406
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,044
Weren't there three of them?

407
00:31:47,044 --> 00:31:49,878
Shit! We lost one.

408
00:31:49,878 --> 00:31:52,587
We'll have to do without.

409
00:31:52,587 --> 00:31:54,720
Guys, let's do it right.

410
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,737
We've still got a few games
to end on a good note.

411
00:31:57,737 --> 00:32:00,539
I know it's the transfer season,

412
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:03,272
and some of you
have got your minds elsewhere.

413
00:32:03,272 --> 00:32:05,430
If only you knew!

414
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,390
Alright, ladies? How's it going?

415
00:32:10,918 --> 00:32:11,768
Nice tights.

416
00:32:12,528 --> 00:32:13,890
What do you want?

417
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,769
Nice to see you, too.

418
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:20,567
I thought I'd visit the provinces,
see how it's going,

419
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:23,517
see why you struggle so much.
Just kidding.

420
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:25,920
How are the joints?
I love old guy.

421
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,491
I've got some big news
that I'd like to tell

422
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:30,766
the guy concerned.

423
00:32:31,698 --> 00:32:35,025
See this pretty face?
It's worth 35 million euros!

424
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:37,878
- You spoke to London?
- I sure did.

425
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:39,766
You're London's new striker.

426
00:32:39,766 --> 00:32:41,184
Guys, I told you so!

427
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:44,613
London, guys, I knew it! Thanks, Marco!

428
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:47,049
My pleasure, you deserve it.

429
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,363
Manu,

430
00:32:51,173 --> 00:32:52,926
you'll stay next season.

431
00:32:52,926 --> 00:32:55,868
I tried hard with the Krauts,
they wanted Castellari.

432
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:57,641
Is that it? Are you done?

433
00:32:58,265 --> 00:33:01,610
Now get out, Zombroni.
Don't upset them before the game.

434
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,659
Cool it, tiger.
You're not playing Madrid.

435
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:08,047
Guys,
let's put on a good show tonight.

436
00:33:08,047 --> 00:33:10,074
Idriss, up front, a team game.

437
00:33:10,074 --> 00:33:10,594
What?

438
00:33:11,303 --> 00:33:13,584
Hold on, you're not playing the kid?

439
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:15,561
For now, he's still ours.

440
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,924
Isn't the contract signed yet?

441
00:33:17,924 --> 00:33:19,554
Sure! Well, as good as.

442
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,865
You just have to do a physical
for the insurance.

443
00:33:22,865 --> 00:33:25,449
Sam, you're captain,
show some enthusiasm.

444
00:33:25,449 --> 00:33:25,969
Yes.

445
00:33:27,318 --> 00:33:28,949
Go easy on the kid, OK?

446
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,435
He'll play and sweat, like the others.

447
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:37,106
You're a regular General Patton!
Very impressive.

448
00:33:37,106 --> 00:33:38,810
You should thank me.

449
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,035
With that transfer free,
the club could buy 3 more Koreans.

450
00:33:42,035 --> 00:33:46,097
And maybe a new coach,
cos you've really let them down.

451
00:33:49,091 --> 00:33:50,509
Get out of here now.

452
00:33:57,251 --> 00:33:58,456
What a fun bunch.

453
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,821
Hurry along,
there's not many seats left.

454
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:11,935
The Lagrippe Stadium hasn't been
so full for a long time.

455
00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:14,918
Tonight, all Caplongue is here.

456
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:18,148
Now weddings, funerals
or christenings

457
00:34:18,148 --> 00:34:20,385
were held today,
because Caplongue has priorities.

458
00:34:20,385 --> 00:34:23,885
And today in Caplongue,
soccer is king again!

459
00:34:23,885 --> 00:34:27,403
You got the tickets 6 months ago,
and I'm in row B.

460
00:34:27,403 --> 00:34:29,955
It's crap.
You see much better from up there.

461
00:34:29,955 --> 00:34:32,152
Concentrate, guys!

462
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,814
Play me for 5 minutes, just for show.

463
00:34:35,814 --> 00:34:38,976
No, you play as long as I say,
we have to win.

464
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,829
And Idriss,
pass the ball to Sam.

465
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,444
No, coach, whenever I do,
he's always late.

466
00:34:44,444 --> 00:34:47,919
It's his town, he's captain,
make him look good.

467
00:34:54,397 --> 00:34:57,606
Lets hear it fo Caplongue!

468
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:02,175
Azincourt, #2, is captain.

469
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,739
But Jean Belvaux, #10,
is nowhere to be seen.

470
00:35:13,192 --> 00:35:15,603
And now Paris come onto the pitch.

471
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:19,178
The captain's armband is worn

472
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,488
by Samuel Lorit, a local boy,

473
00:35:23,653 --> 00:35:25,072
give him a big hand!

474
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:36,572
Let's go!

475
00:35:40,484 --> 00:35:43,398
Paris, one from bottom
of League 1,

476
00:35:43,398 --> 00:35:47,156
have come to challenge
Caplongue on their home turf.

477
00:35:56,126 --> 00:35:58,122
Get lost, those are our seats.

478
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,043
Take it easy!

479
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:33,631
Don't let us down with this.

480
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,714
Yeah, I mean no.
I don't feel great about this.

481
00:36:37,714 --> 00:36:40,566
Honestly, I don't feel right,
I feel sick.

482
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:41,132
Michel.

483
00:36:43,308 --> 00:36:45,667
The guy will come out of his booth.
As usual.

484
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:47,699
The cassette player's on the right.

485
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:49,710
You go in, insert the cassete,

486
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,520
then press play
when we throw the flares. OK?

487
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,868
You've gotta do it.

488
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:56,866
You can't back out.

489
00:36:57,785 --> 00:37:00,543
He doesn't want to upset
his Parisian pals.

490
00:37:15,355 --> 00:37:16,753
There's a problem.

491
00:37:16,753 --> 00:37:18,431
What kind of problem?

492
00:37:18,431 --> 00:37:21,224
Jeannot's not here.
Can we delay for 5 minutes?

493
00:37:21,224 --> 00:37:24,472
No way. That's impossible.

494
00:37:25,629 --> 00:37:27,864
They'll tear the place apart!

495
00:37:27,864 --> 00:37:28,384
Sam!

496
00:37:31,656 --> 00:37:32,949
What's up?

497
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:34,596
You alright?

498
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:36,495
Yeah.

499
00:37:36,495 --> 00:37:38,268
Do you know Jean Belvaux?

500
00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:41,728
Jeannot?
Sure, we used to play together.

501
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:44,280
He's not playing. He didn't show up.

502
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:47,213
Pity. I'd have liked to see him.

503
00:37:47,213 --> 00:37:50,100
Actually, it's good for us. Now go!

504
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,104
The coach makes
a late tactical change,

505
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,018
and Franck Boucet comes on.

506
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:58,587
And that's it, game on!

507
00:38:01,972 --> 00:38:03,319
Ready for kick off.

508
00:38:04,214 --> 00:38:06,164
It'll be underway soon.

509
00:38:10,803 --> 00:38:13,852
A good clean game,
respect the opposition.

510
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:16,497
Good luck.

511
00:38:18,205 --> 00:38:19,338
Good luck, guys.

512
00:38:20,776 --> 00:38:23,613
You know you're not going
to walk out of here.

513
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:42,636
Go on Jeannot!

514
00:38:52,446 --> 00:38:54,297
Go, Caplongue!

515
00:39:07,649 --> 00:39:08,215
Come on!

516
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:23,405
Come on!

517
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:27,489
Hold onto the ball!

518
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:28,338
Hammer them!

519
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,783
Play on!

520
00:39:40,783 --> 00:39:42,032
Get up, Mr Lorit.

521
00:39:42,032 --> 00:39:44,040
Shit, that was a foul!

522
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:10,803
Stick on him, have him!

523
00:40:23,727 --> 00:40:25,433
What's he up to?

524
00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:26,564
Idrisss!

525
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,842
Idriss!
Let it go. Step off the gas.

526
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:37,357
Come on, Idriss, put some effort in!

527
00:40:46,162 --> 00:40:47,727
Idriss!

528
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:53,529
I was unmarked!

529
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,415
What the fuck are you doing?
Come on!

530
00:41:17,049 --> 00:41:17,757
It's here.

531
00:41:21,144 --> 00:41:21,664
Fuck!

532
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:36,904
No sign of his buddy?

533
00:41:36,904 --> 00:41:37,842
No.

534
00:41:38,715 --> 00:41:40,771
We'd better call for back-up.

535
00:41:43,956 --> 00:41:45,090
That'll be hard.

536
00:41:47,348 --> 00:41:48,908
He's burnt it all out.

537
00:41:50,406 --> 00:41:52,037
It's all cos of soccer.

538
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:23,971
Shoot right!

539
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:31,444
Bastard!

540
00:42:38,894 --> 00:42:40,103
Shoot!

541
00:43:08,538 --> 00:43:09,746
Fuck you!

542
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:26,888
- What the hell?
- Asshole!

543
00:43:26,888 --> 00:43:30,101
- What's your problem?
- Fuck off! Go on, get lost!

544
00:43:36,718 --> 00:43:38,207
Idriss, substitution.

545
00:43:41,602 --> 00:43:44,162
Get out of my face! Fuck you!
No way!

546
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,684
Lorit, get lost!

547
00:43:50,206 --> 00:43:52,252
Lorit, off!

548
00:43:52,954 --> 00:43:55,515
A yellow, fair enough, but not red!

549
00:43:55,515 --> 00:43:57,627
You saw, it wasn't deliberate.

550
00:43:57,627 --> 00:44:00,168
Yeah, and 17 years ago
it wasn't either.

551
00:44:00,168 --> 00:44:00,689
What?

552
00:44:02,951 --> 00:44:04,866
You're still stuck on that?

553
00:44:20,814 --> 00:44:22,303
You can all fuck off!

554
00:44:23,645 --> 00:44:25,772
I don't need you! I never did!

555
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:29,805
Lorit, off!

556
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:36,516
I asked you to go, Lorit.
Don't make it worse.

557
00:44:36,516 --> 00:44:38,978
Quitter scumbag.

558
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:49,003
No! No!

559
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:52,851
Asshole! Lorit the whore!

560
00:44:57,456 --> 00:44:59,729
That one was deliberate, asshole.

561
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:19,259
What the hell...

562
00:45:20,769 --> 00:45:22,294
Where you off to?

563
00:45:22,294 --> 00:45:23,073
The toilet.

564
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,836
But it's just hotting up.

565
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:27,461
I'll be right back.

566
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:28,311
Yeah, right.

567
00:45:29,738 --> 00:45:30,446
I promise.

568
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,723
Lorit the whore

569
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

570
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:22,021
- Has it started?
- Yes, without Jeannot.

571
00:46:22,535 --> 00:46:23,668
How can that be?

572
00:46:24,259 --> 00:46:27,592
- I don't know.
- He was supposed to get here.

573
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

574
00:47:38,161 --> 00:47:38,681
Lorit!

575
00:47:59,801 --> 00:48:00,580
Time to go.

576
00:48:03,018 --> 00:48:04,791
- Come on!
- Yeah, yeah.

577
00:48:06,006 --> 00:48:07,576
Here I go.

578
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:30,212
Guys!

579
00:48:30,212 --> 00:48:32,662
We are Caplongue!

580
00:48:40,673 --> 00:48:42,800
Guys, I can't do it! It's off!

581
00:49:00,078 --> 00:49:02,095
Fuck! Where's the song?

582
00:49:03,931 --> 00:49:06,167
I knew that jerk would let us down.

583
00:49:14,193 --> 00:49:15,114
It's Jeannot!

584
00:49:15,892 --> 00:49:17,372
Guys, Jeannot's here.

585
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:19,470
Kill them, Jeannot!

586
00:50:31,201 --> 00:50:33,063
This is the men's locker room.

587
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,024
I know, I wanted to talk to you.

588
00:50:35,024 --> 00:50:35,545
Really?

589
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:39,300
To tell me what?

590
00:50:40,126 --> 00:50:41,828
That I betrayed you all?

591
00:50:42,879 --> 00:50:44,510
That you'll crucify me?

592
00:50:45,304 --> 00:50:46,225
OK, forget it.

593
00:50:47,656 --> 00:50:48,789
Yeah, forget it.

594
00:50:54,143 --> 00:50:56,015
Screw soccer.

595
00:51:03,035 --> 00:51:04,670
Then what?

596
00:51:05,945 --> 00:51:08,512
I'd like you to give me
a little of your time.

597
00:51:16,277 --> 00:51:17,056
You of age?

598
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:18,489
Absolutely.

599
00:51:19,257 --> 00:51:20,919
Let's get drunk.

600
00:51:20,919 --> 00:51:22,267
My friend...

601
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:23,188
- Now!
- OK.

602
00:51:46,495 --> 00:51:47,344
Go, Jeannot!

603
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,641
What the fuck's going on?

604
00:52:19,025 --> 00:52:20,585
What the hell is that?

605
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:35,752
We have to get the kid off.

606
00:53:31,794 --> 00:53:34,706
They just leave the bar unattended?

607
00:53:34,706 --> 00:53:37,241
That's the Caplongue mentality.

608
00:53:37,241 --> 00:53:37,878
See that?

609
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,143
That's me.

610
00:53:40,143 --> 00:53:40,663
Yeah.

611
00:53:43,917 --> 00:53:45,121
What's your name?

612
00:53:45,665 --> 00:53:47,284
Cleo.

613
00:53:47,284 --> 00:53:48,344
Chloe? Nice.

614
00:53:48,344 --> 00:53:52,135
Thanks, but it's Cleo.
E, O. Cleo.

615
00:53:52,135 --> 00:53:52,655
Why?

616
00:53:54,466 --> 00:53:55,174
Why, what?

617
00:53:56,508 --> 00:53:57,783
That's not a name.

618
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,273
It is. It's mine, anyway.

619
00:54:03,193 --> 00:54:03,713
Right.

620
00:54:04,412 --> 00:54:05,616
I'm crap at this.

621
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:10,859
A bitter defeat.

622
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:16,764
Just help yourself!

623
00:54:17,447 --> 00:54:19,922
Don't worry, I'll pay it.

624
00:54:21,207 --> 00:54:25,021
I'll buy the bar if I want.
Know how much I earn?

625
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:27,338
I don't really care.

626
00:54:32,066 --> 00:54:34,650
You got a real problem round here.

627
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:36,460
Grudges are the local religion.

628
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:38,053
You're from here.

629
00:54:38,053 --> 00:54:39,979
And I'm leaving ASAP.

630
00:54:48,635 --> 00:54:51,400
Unless we spend a little time together.

631
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,800
- You're quite cute.
- Excuse me?

632
00:54:57,898 --> 00:54:59,174
I mean, you'll do.

633
00:55:00,124 --> 00:55:02,748
Footballers don't just go for models.

634
00:55:03,831 --> 00:55:06,115
You're wasting your time.

635
00:55:07,517 --> 00:55:12,182
- So you're not the kind who...
- Who what?

636
00:55:12,182 --> 00:55:14,865
-A girl you give money to...
- And who does what?

637
00:55:16,737 --> 00:55:20,955
- You give her money, then she...
- You think I'm whore?

638
00:55:20,955 --> 00:55:22,940
Yes, no, wait. I don't mind.

639
00:55:23,928 --> 00:55:26,694
You take me for a hooker.
You're sick!

640
00:55:27,481 --> 00:55:29,555
Hey, you came to the locker room,

641
00:55:29,555 --> 00:55:33,100
you brought me here.
I just got the wrong idea, Cleo.

642
00:55:35,934 --> 00:55:36,855
Take it easy.

643
00:55:37,814 --> 00:55:40,012
- If you don't ask...
- Loser.

644
00:55:42,475 --> 00:55:43,609
Fuck you, bitch.

645
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

646
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,412
What the hell?

647
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:08,326
They're vomiting everywhere,
biting each other.

648
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,342
They're trashing everything.

649
00:56:11,405 --> 00:56:13,461
They're turning into savages.

650
00:56:16,887 --> 00:56:18,823
There's hundreds dead!

651
00:56:19,879 --> 00:56:22,130
The whole Paris team is gone!

652
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:23,264
It's a massacre!

653
00:56:26,745 --> 00:56:28,540
Shit! What do we do?

654
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,951
We do like Pop. We get outta here!

655
00:56:34,505 --> 00:56:35,942
Ah, Fred!

656
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,270
What?

657
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:42,212
She must be off her face.
She works in TV.

658
00:56:42,212 --> 00:56:43,701
We have to shut this!

659
00:57:35,912 --> 00:57:37,553
Thanks.

660
00:57:48,891 --> 00:57:50,632
And who are you?

661
00:57:51,479 --> 00:57:53,726
I'm his daughter.

662
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:18,941
GOAL OF THE DEAD

663
01:00:18,941 --> 01:00:23,067
SECOND HALF

664
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:44,074
Miss!

665
01:01:01,857 --> 01:01:04,521
What the hell is going on?

666
01:01:10,411 --> 01:01:14,199
You little hoodlums!
What did you do that woman?

667
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:16,373
- What woman?
- That one, dammit!

668
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:18,507
Do something, boss, they're nuts!

669
01:01:18,507 --> 01:01:20,548
- They got Cuillere!
- They're mad!

670
01:01:20,548 --> 01:01:23,090
Yeah, right.
I've had enough of you boys.

671
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:26,471
Public disorder, harassment,
and you're drunk to boot.

672
01:01:26,471 --> 01:01:29,655
- No way!
- It's not a riot. It's the apocalypse!

673
01:01:29,655 --> 01:01:31,484
- The apocalypse.
- Yeah!

674
01:01:31,484 --> 01:01:33,185
And they're very rude!

675
01:01:33,185 --> 01:01:36,891
I'm sick of you, welfare all week
and weekend thuggery.

676
01:01:36,891 --> 01:01:38,402
Think I like it?

677
01:01:38,402 --> 01:01:40,985
It's community service for you.
Let's go!

678
01:01:40,985 --> 01:01:43,396
- It's over.
- You can't do that.

679
01:01:46,314 --> 01:01:48,299
Very good, Annabelle! Great!

680
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:51,067
Good one!

681
01:01:55,373 --> 01:01:56,081
Annabelle?

682
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:00,522
Take it easy, Annabelle.

683
01:02:01,236 --> 01:02:02,796
Don't leave us to die!

684
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,618
- It's OK, boys. I got this.
- The keys!

685
01:02:06,618 --> 01:02:08,407
You must have 400 of them!

686
01:02:08,407 --> 01:02:09,882
It's here. I'll find it!

687
01:02:09,882 --> 01:02:12,433
That's the cellar, that's the garage...

688
01:02:12,433 --> 01:02:15,076
I know...

689
01:02:15,076 --> 01:02:17,873
I'll be right back.
I got a spare in the office.

690
01:02:19,218 --> 01:02:20,986
Help!

691
01:02:22,216 --> 01:02:25,335
Teddy, we got to go.
Give it all you got.

692
01:02:25,335 --> 01:02:27,014
Go for it!

693
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:55,399
Fucking hell!

694
01:02:58,257 --> 01:02:59,462
Go, go, go, guys!

695
01:03:07,398 --> 01:03:10,197
Carole Pinchon. Ever heard of her?

696
01:03:10,197 --> 01:03:12,821
Carol Pinchon?
You must be mistaken.

697
01:03:13,805 --> 01:03:14,513
We'll see.

698
01:03:15,115 --> 01:03:17,442
Typical male amnesia.

699
01:03:17,442 --> 01:03:18,921
Not you, too?

700
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:20,764
I'm just listening to her.

701
01:03:22,792 --> 01:03:23,713
Oh, I get it.

702
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:28,105
You rehearsed this.
You want money, is that it?

703
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,328
It's all a set up?

704
01:03:30,328 --> 01:03:32,533
We want nothing from you.

705
01:03:32,533 --> 01:03:34,235
She never mentioned you.

706
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:37,322
She just cried over some photos.

707
01:03:37,322 --> 01:03:40,392
- Photo of who?
- Who did you think?

708
01:03:40,392 --> 01:03:44,358
What does that prove?
Loads of women have my photo!

709
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What a shitbag!
We could all die here.
It's not the time for family problems.

710
01:03:55,824 --> 01:03:57,100
Get the fuck away!

711
01:04:01,878 --> 01:04:02,941
Have they gone?

712
01:04:05,695 --> 01:04:07,467
You just have to be firm.

713
01:04:11,828 --> 01:04:12,394
Oh shit!

714
01:04:31,514 --> 01:04:35,059
Did you see their faces?
This is some weird shit!

715
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:38,415
I got to put you down now.

716
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,059
You OK?

717
01:04:42,059 --> 01:04:44,459
No network, dammit!

718
01:04:45,104 --> 01:04:46,562
Can I call my family?

719
01:04:46,562 --> 01:04:50,212
Move back a little.
You're invading my personal space.

720
01:04:51,473 --> 01:04:55,968
Great idea to hide in this rat hole
with the local leech.

721
01:04:55,968 --> 01:04:57,241
Will we die?

722
01:04:57,241 --> 01:05:01,216
I probably won't,
but in that state, you probably will.

723
01:05:01,216 --> 01:05:02,899
Be nice to the players.

724
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,660
Are you going to puke?
Give me some space!

725
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:09,296
What do they want?
It's just soccer, it's nothing personal!

726
01:05:10,684 --> 01:05:12,670
It's these losers big day,

727
01:05:13,189 --> 01:05:17,153
so they want to make it worth it.
They want to have a good time.

728
01:05:17,153 --> 01:05:18,642
They want to kill us!

729
01:05:19,177 --> 01:05:21,534
It's down to lack of sporting spirit.

730
01:05:21,534 --> 01:05:23,340
What does your spirit get us?

731
01:05:23,966 --> 01:05:26,518
We should stick with our own kind.

732
01:05:26,518 --> 01:05:28,109
London's finished for me.

733
01:05:28,109 --> 01:05:30,945
Why do you say that?
Can't you hear it?

734
01:05:34,427 --> 01:05:39,249
Big ben's calling. I'll get you out.
Don't worry about the old man.

735
01:05:39,962 --> 01:05:43,436
If you puke on my shoes,
I'll rip your head off.

736
01:05:45,269 --> 01:05:47,822
I don't know what's happening to me.

737
01:05:49,968 --> 01:05:51,244
You got a thing...

738
01:05:51,944 --> 01:05:52,794
Right there.

739
01:05:53,689 --> 01:05:55,378
- Where?
- Up a bit.

740
01:05:55,378 --> 01:05:57,882
There. Oh, forget it.

741
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:04,674
Come to the bathroom, big fella.

742
01:06:04,674 --> 01:06:06,540
Come on, let's go.

743
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:08,615
Come on.

744
01:06:10,094 --> 01:06:12,221
That's it. Better out than in.

745
01:06:13,857 --> 01:06:15,707
That's it, good job.

746
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:18,783
This isn't a training session, old man!

747
01:06:18,783 --> 01:06:21,701
The most important thing
is to say together.

748
01:06:21,701 --> 01:06:24,550
That shrimp can take care of himself.

749
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:26,257
He's all I'm interested in.
That's all.

750
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:30,909
This is getting bad.
It's time to get serious.

751
01:06:30,909 --> 01:06:33,101
Defensively, we're screwed.

752
01:06:33,101 --> 01:06:34,610
We have to attack.

753
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:36,383
That's it. Grandpa's off.

754
01:06:37,074 --> 01:06:41,258
This is a locker room. It's my domain.
Shut up and listen.

755
01:06:43,161 --> 01:06:44,366
We'll set an aim.

756
01:06:44,893 --> 01:06:46,819
Idriss, hold back.
We'll need your speed.

757
01:06:47,331 --> 01:06:49,890
Marco, make space. 2 in front, 2 behind.

758
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:52,230
He's losing the plot. Incredible.

759
01:06:57,198 --> 01:06:59,398
It's all to play for.

760
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:04,157
We didn't do all this work for nothing.

761
01:07:06,503 --> 01:07:07,779
All our efforts

762
01:07:09,139 --> 01:07:11,054
are going to pay off today.

763
01:07:13,507 --> 01:07:15,705
We need to take back the pitch.

764
01:07:16,757 --> 01:07:20,032
Inch by inch.

765
01:07:22,779 --> 01:07:25,190
If we work together, we can do it.

766
01:07:26,489 --> 01:07:29,728
Together, we are everything.

767
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:32,639
Alone, we're nothing.

768
01:07:33,673 --> 01:07:36,938
That's soccer.

769
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's life.
It's togetherness.
It's the team.

770
01:07:45,596 --> 01:07:46,863
Oh fuck!

771
01:07:54,249 --> 01:07:56,379
I'll show you a face!

772
01:08:03,515 --> 01:08:05,047
Get out!

773
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,323
What about Coach?

774
01:08:30,323 --> 01:08:33,280
Don't touch him,
that stuff's contagious!

775
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:36,270
- We can't leave him like that!
- He's screwed.

776
01:08:37,712 --> 01:08:40,548
He's mutating. Get the hell out of here.

777
01:08:48,345 --> 01:08:50,508
- Now what?
- I don't know.

778
01:08:50,508 --> 01:08:52,848
There's only one place we can go.

779
01:08:53,398 --> 01:08:56,273
- Where?
- You know perfectly well!

780
01:08:56,273 --> 01:08:57,762
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

781
01:08:58,565 --> 01:08:59,794
Absolutely not.

782
01:08:59,794 --> 01:09:02,019
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

783
01:09:02,019 --> 01:09:05,249
Like father, like daughter, clearly.

784
01:09:08,586 --> 01:09:09,530
I won't go.

785
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:13,005
Stay here and die then.
I don't care. I'm going.

786
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:16,569
How dare she?

787
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,830
Did you see that?
If I was her father, I'd...

788
01:09:21,928 --> 01:09:24,659
Wait for me!
I just played a match!

789
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:27,033
Shit, I've got cramp. Cramp!

790
01:09:27,033 --> 01:09:28,806
What the hell's going on?

791
01:09:29,611 --> 01:09:31,928
They trashed everything.

792
01:09:35,582 --> 01:09:38,173
Oh shit, Gregoire...

793
01:10:00,358 --> 01:10:02,216
Dammit!

794
01:10:03,886 --> 01:10:05,967
Nothing's working.

795
01:10:06,568 --> 01:10:09,788
With all the down,
we're totally isolated.

796
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:11,231
How do we get word out?

797
01:10:11,231 --> 01:10:12,151
I've no idea.

798
01:10:13,488 --> 01:10:15,828
We're not equipped for this shit.

799
01:10:27,102 --> 01:10:29,867
They're not giving up. What's going on?

800
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:45,616
That fuck's eating
my fake leather seats!

801
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:50,398
That won't blow their heads off.

802
01:10:50,398 --> 01:10:52,525
Nobody's blowing anything off.

803
01:10:53,105 --> 01:10:55,162
We aim for the legs.

804
01:10:55,162 --> 01:10:57,042
We all knoe each other here.

805
01:10:57,042 --> 01:10:58,471
3 have come back.

806
01:10:58,471 --> 01:11:00,536
The big one's all lopsided.

807
01:11:00,536 --> 01:11:03,168
- Help! Open up!
- Go away!

808
01:11:03,919 --> 01:11:07,275
- Don't shoot, I play soccer!
- Caplongue or Paris?

809
01:11:07,275 --> 01:11:09,281
Please, I beg you! Open up!

810
01:11:09,281 --> 01:11:10,841
Please, open the door!

811
01:11:19,368 --> 01:11:21,810
Hi, Dad.

812
01:11:23,386 --> 01:11:24,918
Hello.

813
01:11:24,918 --> 01:11:27,404
- Dad?
- Yep.

814
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:34,188
Dammit, I knew it!

815
01:11:34,188 --> 01:11:35,748
That's not new, is it?

816
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:40,387
It's nothing. I can walk.

817
01:11:40,387 --> 01:11:41,836
You're not fit.

818
01:11:41,836 --> 01:11:43,396
What? You're paranoid.

819
01:11:43,909 --> 01:11:47,875
It's nothing.
The doc said just to take it a bit easy.

820
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:50,853
Finally,
you're confiding in Uncle Marco.

821
01:11:55,205 --> 01:11:55,984
You know,

822
01:11:57,523 --> 01:12:00,447
in London, the weather is horrible.

823
01:12:00,447 --> 01:12:02,806
Your Mum won't be able to handle it.

824
01:12:02,806 --> 01:12:05,571
- What is this, Marco?
- It's nothing.

825
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:10,975
You don't care about me.
You just want your money.

826
01:12:10,975 --> 01:12:13,454
Oh poor you.
How much did you earn this year?

827
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:18,988
I've been playing soccer since I was 5.

828
01:12:18,988 --> 01:12:21,382
It's my whole life, you hear?

829
01:12:21,382 --> 01:12:24,977
I think about London every day.
I thought we were pals.

830
01:12:24,977 --> 01:12:28,735
We are, but we don't have
to do everything together.

831
01:12:29,648 --> 01:12:31,692
Don't do this to me.

832
01:12:43,979 --> 01:12:46,239
What the hell?

833
01:12:56,022 --> 01:12:57,742
Thanks.

834
01:12:57,742 --> 01:13:00,036
Idriss Diago!
 I don't believe it.

835
01:13:00,036 --> 01:13:00,815
Weird, huh?

836
01:13:15,115 --> 01:13:18,716
- You said your dad was dead.
- Did you?

837
01:13:19,256 --> 01:13:23,235
No. I never said that. She's twisting
my words. She's a journalist.

838
01:13:23,235 --> 01:13:24,724
And I'm his daughter.

839
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:27,935
A granddaughter?

840
01:13:28,648 --> 01:13:32,613
Yes. I mean no. That's what she says.
I don't remember her Mum.

841
01:13:32,613 --> 01:13:35,054
It's handy for you, forgetting things.

842
01:13:35,589 --> 01:13:37,376
- He tried to chat me up.
- What?

843
01:13:37,376 --> 01:13:40,601
She's lying! It was her.
She said she was old enough.

844
01:13:41,193 --> 01:13:41,714
I'm 17.

845
01:13:43,202 --> 01:13:45,258
- I didn't know.
- You jerk.

846
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:47,454
Your Mum's name?

847
01:13:47,454 --> 01:13:50,390
- I got an idea...
- This is family talk.

848
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:51,453
Carole Pinchon.

849
01:13:54,155 --> 01:13:57,265
Yes, Carole Pinchon.
Slim girl, perky.

850
01:13:57,265 --> 01:13:58,327
Carole Pinchon!

851
01:14:00,292 --> 01:14:02,239
- Straight hair?
- Yes!

852
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,716
- Brunette?
- My Mum's blond.

853
01:14:04,716 --> 01:14:08,403
- Can I just say...
- You can just shut your mouth.

854
01:14:08,909 --> 01:14:10,752
You succeded at something.

855
01:14:11,412 --> 01:14:13,021
I'm a success, dad.

856
01:14:13,021 --> 01:14:17,135
No you're not. Being a soccer player
is not a proper job.

857
01:14:18,461 --> 01:14:20,872
But you,
you can call me grandpa!

858
01:14:21,528 --> 01:14:23,372
- Whoa, there.
- Can I...

859
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:26,156
You don't to call me grandpa?

860
01:14:26,156 --> 01:14:27,503
- Yes.
- Yes, who?

861
01:14:28,726 --> 01:14:30,380
- yes Grandpa?
- Good.

862
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:32,581
- Boss?
- Pitt's got an idea.

863
01:14:32,581 --> 01:14:34,171
What is it?

864
01:14:36,022 --> 01:14:39,284
I was thinking about
the CB radio in the car.

865
01:14:40,015 --> 01:14:43,671
I've just had an idea.
You got CB radio in the car?

866
01:14:43,671 --> 01:14:46,183
- Yes.
- Then we've got CB in the car!

867
01:14:46,753 --> 01:14:47,390
Let's go!

868
01:14:47,925 --> 01:14:50,974
No, you stay there.
The women stay inside.

869
01:14:55,788 --> 01:14:57,519
Wow!

870
01:15:02,871 --> 01:15:05,196
Shit, I don't believe this.

871
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

872
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:37,753
You didn't die?

873
01:15:38,644 --> 01:15:39,423
Yes, I did.

874
01:15:41,701 --> 01:15:45,126
But I resuscitated.

875
01:15:46,594 --> 01:15:48,012
I'm pleased for you.

876
01:15:49,225 --> 01:15:51,351
And Idriss?

877
01:16:07,071 --> 01:16:10,395
3 days ago,
we were spitting at you on TV.

878
01:16:10,395 --> 01:16:14,116
And that hand-goal against Lorient.
The ref never saw it!

879
01:16:14,116 --> 01:16:15,738
It's not my fault.

880
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:18,306
No, I think you're cool.
You got a great future.

881
01:16:18,818 --> 01:16:22,081
I'm like you.
I live but I'm from Paris.

882
01:16:22,081 --> 01:16:24,456
I'm not from Paris.
I'm from the Val d'Oise.

883
01:16:24,456 --> 01:16:26,048
Where's that, then?

884
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:30,066
You go to Cergy-le-Haut on the A line,
then you...

885
01:16:30,066 --> 01:16:32,652
Forget it.

886
01:16:32,652 --> 01:16:35,134
- Is there a way out?
- Of course.

887
01:16:36,811 --> 01:16:37,660
What's that?

888
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:39,686
It's a cassette.

889
01:16:40,617 --> 01:16:44,092
- They don't exist anymore.
- Yes, they do here.

890
01:16:46,212 --> 01:16:50,109
- What's on it?
- Mainly music.

891
01:16:52,494 --> 01:16:53,486
What's it for?

892
01:16:55,751 --> 01:16:58,069
Trust me.

893
01:16:59,643 --> 01:17:01,132
You're off your head.

894
01:17:31,889 --> 01:17:34,581
He always put me down.

895
01:17:35,098 --> 01:17:38,019
He's just a bit grouchy is all.

896
01:17:40,397 --> 01:17:43,712
He's never come to a single game.
Not one!

897
01:17:43,712 --> 01:17:44,916
That's how he is.

898
01:17:45,581 --> 01:17:46,784
Not human?

899
01:17:46,784 --> 01:17:48,414
What are we doing here?

900
01:17:49,107 --> 01:17:50,525
We wait, in silence.

901
01:17:51,548 --> 01:17:52,751
Good plan.

902
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:54,249
Chill out!

903
01:18:05,339 --> 01:18:07,466
You don't remember me?

904
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:11,438
Because we already met.

905
01:18:12,405 --> 01:18:14,213
Yes...

906
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:17,474
Yes, yes. I was just thinking that...

907
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:22,952
- Are you hitting on her?
- Can you stop with the teenage thing?

908
01:18:22,952 --> 01:18:23,472
Thanks.

909
01:18:24,524 --> 01:18:27,978
It was at the party
after the match against Guingamp.

910
01:18:27,978 --> 01:18:29,338
In the locker room.

911
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:31,961
- We drank a little too much.
- Yes.

912
01:18:32,764 --> 01:18:35,164
- Yes. You and me.
- Yes.

913
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:38,319
- Just us two?
- Of course.

914
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:41,156
Maybe you were
with a bunch of swinger?

915
01:18:41,754 --> 01:18:44,837
But after,
establishing paternity can be tricky.

916
01:18:44,837 --> 01:18:46,572
So your Mum's a saint?

917
01:18:46,572 --> 01:18:49,546
Finally, he's getting it.

918
01:18:56,187 --> 01:19:00,292
So we did...

919
01:19:00,292 --> 01:19:02,420
Sometimes I'm not very subtle.

920
01:19:02,954 --> 01:19:05,011
You pucked up and passed out.

921
01:19:06,762 --> 01:19:09,941
I Walked in it next morning.

922
01:19:14,171 --> 01:19:15,446
But just before...

923
01:19:16,188 --> 01:19:18,047
We must have...

924
01:19:19,823 --> 01:19:22,026
No, we didn't.

925
01:19:26,545 --> 01:19:28,400
This is Teddy. Do you copy?

926
01:19:29,114 --> 01:19:31,891
This is Teddy of the Coyotes.
Anyone copy?

927
01:19:31,891 --> 01:19:33,893
Teddy, this is Popeye. You OK?

928
01:19:33,893 --> 01:19:35,513
Roger that. How are you?

929
01:19:35,513 --> 01:19:37,427
Did you stuff the Parisians?

930
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:39,989
This is Captain Lorit.

931
01:19:39,989 --> 01:19:44,555
Caplongue is under siege.
I repeat, Caplongue is under siege.

932
01:19:44,555 --> 01:19:46,508
Send a SWAT team and army!

933
01:19:46,508 --> 01:19:49,529
Yeah, I'll call them.
I got their cell number!

934
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hello Army? It's Popeye.
I need a nuclear sub for an hour or 2...
Listen to me, cretin, and do what I say.
Move your ass and get back to me, OK?

935
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:04,273
Shoot, Teddy! Shoot!

936
01:20:20,074 --> 01:20:26,499
S-o-n-o-f-a-b-i-t-c-h!

937
01:20:41,456 --> 01:20:43,685
For fuck's sake!

938
01:20:48,331 --> 01:20:50,311
Shit, it stings!

939
01:20:51,231 --> 01:20:52,294
They're coming!

940
01:20:53,642 --> 01:20:55,060
Quick, quick, quick!

941
01:21:16,515 --> 01:21:17,507
What happened?

942
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:22,751
He shot me in the belly.
It went in there...

943
01:21:24,608 --> 01:21:25,458
What a mess.

944
01:21:28,931 --> 01:21:30,438
No bars.

945
01:21:34,277 --> 01:21:35,868
No bars.

946
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:38,316
The poor kid.

947
01:21:40,047 --> 01:21:43,647
He tried to be tough
but he was a good kid.

948
01:21:43,647 --> 01:21:45,700
I like him.

949
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,686
Diago, his knee was in bits.

950
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,035
In 2 years, it'd be fucked.

951
01:21:52,172 --> 01:21:53,945
You left him behind, too?

952
01:21:56,313 --> 01:21:59,772
You're a scumbag, Zombroni.

953
01:21:59,772 --> 01:22:02,425
You toss them aside and move on.

954
01:22:02,425 --> 01:22:05,142
Come on. Don't give me all that again.

955
01:22:05,142 --> 01:22:09,401
Money's killing soccer,
the true value of the sport, blah blah.

956
01:22:09,401 --> 01:22:11,628
The world's changed, old man.

957
01:22:11,628 --> 01:22:14,110
You know what their lives are like.

958
01:22:14,744 --> 01:22:19,134
We take them out of the projects
and send them to training camp at 13.

959
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:21,684
Stop it, I might cry.

960
01:22:21,684 --> 01:22:26,412
Then what's their new life like, Marco?

961
01:22:26,971 --> 01:22:30,153
Soccer, PlayStation, more soccer.

962
01:22:31,045 --> 01:22:34,158
Money and whores
are all they care about.

963
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:35,789
What's wrong with that?

964
01:22:38,007 --> 01:22:40,772
Scumbags like you are ruining the game.

965
01:22:41,483 --> 01:22:44,882
You'd have let Idriss be handed around
from club to club.

966
01:22:44,882 --> 01:22:47,672
So it's all for the best.
He's out of all that.

967
01:22:47,672 --> 01:22:51,020
Yes, but it's over.

968
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:53,643
I've waited for this moment for ages.

969
01:22:54,588 --> 01:22:56,715
And I'm not going to waste it.

970
01:23:00,638 --> 01:23:02,765
You know, I like you, Etienne.

971
01:23:03,771 --> 01:23:06,040
We've had our differences but...

972
01:23:06,613 --> 01:23:09,251
But now, right now,

973
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:11,331
I like you.

974
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,365
But if you don't want to get eaten,
we better plan our escape damn quick.

975
01:23:17,365 --> 01:23:19,322
Nobody's leaving here.

976
01:23:19,322 --> 01:23:20,385
We'll both die.

977
01:23:20,931 --> 01:23:24,697
But I'm going to deal with you.
And you're lucky

978
01:23:24,697 --> 01:23:27,969
because I still believe
in good old sporting values.

979
01:23:29,974 --> 01:23:31,108
Fair and square.

980
01:23:32,075 --> 01:23:34,628
- What are you doing?
- Put 'em up!

981
01:23:36,347 --> 01:23:38,545
You've really lost it, Etienne.

982
01:23:42,383 --> 01:23:43,374
You're a drag.

983
01:23:47,446 --> 01:23:48,579
For fuck's sake!

984
01:23:50,594 --> 01:23:55,475
Sorry Etienne, are you OK?
I had to put a stop to it.

985
01:23:55,475 --> 01:23:57,242
Put 'em up!

986
01:23:59,873 --> 01:24:01,785
Put 'em up!

987
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:05,219
OK, fine.

988
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
If that's what you want.
I'll smash your face in.

989
01:24:21,563 --> 01:24:23,761
That's great! Give it your all!

990
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,838
Give it your all! Yeah!

991
01:24:34,681 --> 01:24:37,020
I'm glad I met you before I died.

992
01:24:37,766 --> 01:24:39,689
- Me, too.
- You're not dying.

993
01:24:39,689 --> 01:24:42,631
- He won't die, will he?
- It's very bad.

994
01:24:43,342 --> 01:24:45,257
Is Dr Belvaux still around?

995
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,399
Don't go to Belvaux.

996
01:24:49,311 --> 01:24:50,373
I'm taking him.

997
01:24:51,177 --> 01:24:53,086
- I'll come.
- I will too, then.

998
01:24:53,086 --> 01:24:54,931
You there, watch her.

999
01:24:54,931 --> 01:24:56,755
We're not babysitters.

1000
01:24:56,755 --> 01:24:58,561
They're just drunks.

1001
01:24:58,561 --> 01:25:00,404
And smoking pot is better?

1002
01:25:01,535 --> 01:25:02,597
You take drugs?

1003
01:25:03,368 --> 01:25:04,981
Of course not, Grandpa.

1004
01:25:04,981 --> 01:25:06,559
We're getting the point here.

1005
01:25:06,559 --> 01:25:08,261
I don't care. I'm going.

1006
01:25:09,031 --> 01:25:11,204
Do what your dad says.

1007
01:25:25,481 --> 01:25:27,112
Just look at this mess!

1008
01:25:28,175 --> 01:25:32,321
- Here, kitty!
- Come along!

1009
01:25:35,048 --> 01:25:36,466
What do we do, Pitt?

1010
01:25:37,505 --> 01:25:39,277
Come on, come and get it.

1011
01:25:40,313 --> 01:25:41,163
Here, kitty!

1012
01:25:42,273 --> 01:25:45,038
There's lots and lots and lots of them!

1013
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:46,598
Here! Come on!

1014
01:25:47,443 --> 01:25:48,790
Come on, come on...

1015
01:25:50,409 --> 01:25:52,101
Come on!

1016
01:25:59,259 --> 01:26:00,038
No, no, no!

1017
01:26:00,659 --> 01:26:02,574
- Here!
- We're over here!

1018
01:26:04,424 --> 01:26:06,835
Caplongue asshole!

1019
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:10,199
Caplongue motherfuckers!

1020
01:26:11,972 --> 01:26:15,147
Yeah! Your mother, your sister,
your brother and your father!

1021
01:26:15,661 --> 01:26:16,936
Bunch of dickwads!

1022
01:26:18,236 --> 01:26:20,009
Up your ass! Up your ass!

1023
01:26:31,870 --> 01:26:34,326
I never felt part of a whole.

1024
01:26:34,326 --> 01:26:39,045
It's like there's something inside me
that needs to be different.

1025
01:26:39,045 --> 01:26:43,159
To emerge, to flourish,
to affirm myself, to be myself...

1026
01:26:43,674 --> 01:26:45,871
To get back to my roots.

1027
01:26:45,871 --> 01:26:46,792
No, listen,

1028
01:26:47,655 --> 01:26:51,353
I like my friends here,
but it's not the same.

1029
01:26:51,353 --> 01:26:54,601
I really identify with you.
Just wait a sec...

1030
01:26:54,601 --> 01:26:58,792
And let me tell you something...
This chat's really doing me good.

1031
01:26:58,792 --> 01:27:02,761
- Do yourself good over there, pal.
- No, because we're the same.

1032
01:27:02,761 --> 01:27:05,920
We're the same.
Not physically, of course.

1033
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,729
But we feel rejected,
we're seeking our origins.

1034
01:27:08,729 --> 01:27:11,391
Me, here, coming from the capital,

1035
01:27:11,391 --> 01:27:15,492
and you, your African side...

1036
01:27:15,492 --> 01:27:19,757
Great ancestral traditions,
arid landscapes... You get me?

1037
01:27:19,757 --> 01:27:22,249
- Not at all.
- Sure you do.

1038
01:27:22,249 --> 01:27:24,022
Integration, for example.

1039
01:27:25,348 --> 01:27:27,759
What integration? I was born here!

1040
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:33,574
Under that manly protective shell...

1041
01:27:33,574 --> 01:27:35,205
There's a gentle heart.

1042
01:27:44,614 --> 01:27:46,435
Sorry about your bag.

1043
01:27:46,435 --> 01:27:49,220
It doesn't matter. Have you got a cig?

1044
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,570
I don't smoke.

1045
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:53,068
Of course.
You look after your dream body.

1046
01:27:54,231 --> 01:27:56,772
You think I'm dumbass.

1047
01:27:58,474 --> 01:28:02,578
Aren't you a little egocentric?
It's all me, me, me and my problems...

1048
01:28:02,578 --> 01:28:06,550
Not at all. I love listening
to other people's stories.

1049
01:28:07,462 --> 01:28:10,794
I'm really fantastic listener.
Go right ahead.

1050
01:28:12,793 --> 01:28:16,594
I'm a dolly bird on TV
dressed up to the nines,

1051
01:28:16,594 --> 01:28:19,200
but my dream
was to be a foreign correspondent,

1052
01:28:19,799 --> 01:28:21,596
reporting on wars, famines...

1053
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:23,353
And I'm at the end of my career,

1054
01:28:23,353 --> 01:28:26,325
lying about my age,
no idea about my future...

1055
01:28:26,325 --> 01:28:29,562
People always confuse me
with that fat tart on the weather.

1056
01:28:29,562 --> 01:28:32,000
I'll have to do washing powder ads.

1057
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,702
Or worse, charity stuff.

1058
01:28:35,712 --> 01:28:37,922
I've got a drink problem.

1059
01:28:37,922 --> 01:28:41,112
I just got stuck
with a stroppy 17-year-old.

1060
01:28:41,718 --> 01:28:43,446
Yep...

1061
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:45,995
Indeed.

1062
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:49,496
He kept it all, the swine!

1063
01:28:49,496 --> 01:28:51,835
The club from when I was a kid,

1064
01:28:53,737 --> 01:28:55,226
my molotov cocktails!

1065
01:28:56,544 --> 01:28:59,327
Look, this is yours.

1066
01:29:03,535 --> 01:29:06,091
Last year's smoke bombs.

1067
01:29:06,631 --> 01:29:09,042
Look, there's even Michel's knife.

1068
01:29:20,448 --> 01:29:22,670
Give me a beer.

1069
01:29:29,354 --> 01:29:30,133
To Michael.

1070
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:32,000
And to Cuillere.

1071
01:29:36,876 --> 01:29:39,003
Is there anyone in your life?

1072
01:29:39,003 --> 01:29:44,647
Apart from the editor who turns up when
his wife's at club Med with the kids?

1073
01:29:44,647 --> 01:29:48,054
- Apart from him.
- Then, no.

1074
01:29:48,054 --> 01:29:52,945
Solangue,
if we ever get out of here...

1075
01:29:52,945 --> 01:29:56,591
- Would you have dinner with me?
- Actually...

1076
01:29:56,591 --> 01:29:57,995
It's OK if not.

1077
01:29:57,995 --> 01:30:01,843
No, I'd like it,
if we ever get out of here.

1078
01:30:01,843 --> 01:30:03,083
Cool.

1079
01:30:03,083 --> 01:30:05,706
But I'd prefer you to call me Solene.

1080
01:30:06,273 --> 01:30:09,211
Don't you get bored drinking all day?

1081
01:30:09,211 --> 01:30:11,069
No.

1082
01:30:11,069 --> 01:30:13,258
Perhaps if your dad hadn't run off...

1083
01:30:13,258 --> 01:30:17,158
- What the hell?
- Then Caplongue would have gone pro.

1084
01:30:17,702 --> 01:30:21,319
We'd have opened a sports store,
made a fortune,

1085
01:30:22,428 --> 01:30:24,923
we'd be married,
would have had kids...

1086
01:30:24,923 --> 01:30:26,157
Yeah.

1087
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:29,401
And wouldn't drink to get over it.

1088
01:30:31,686 --> 01:30:35,523
So my dad's responsible
for your pathetic lives?

1089
01:30:35,523 --> 01:30:37,296
So is he your dad or not?

1090
01:30:38,272 --> 01:30:40,754
Yes, he's my dad. What do you mean?

1091
01:30:41,572 --> 01:30:42,913
Give me a beer.

1092
01:30:42,913 --> 01:30:44,629
Come on.

1093
01:30:59,593 --> 01:31:00,727
Stay there, dad.

1094
01:31:01,424 --> 01:31:03,055
Where am I going to go?

1095
01:31:09,038 --> 01:31:12,725
- Someone's there.
- They might be like the others.

1096
01:31:14,495 --> 01:31:16,834
You're right. I'll go round back.

1097
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:18,811
Come back!

1098
01:31:18,811 --> 01:31:20,947
- I got this. Stay there.
- I will.

1099
01:31:40,236 --> 01:31:41,775
Oh shit!

1100
01:31:41,775 --> 01:31:42,325
Hide!

1101
01:31:42,991 --> 01:31:45,614
It's that girl again! She's after me.

1102
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:48,492
You two have got something.

1103
01:31:48,492 --> 01:31:50,896
She's got something with herself!

1104
01:31:50,896 --> 01:31:53,094
Look at her! She's not my type!

1105
01:31:56,558 --> 01:31:59,823
OK, I'll do her. I'll do her.

1106
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:07,795
Doctor?

1107
01:32:12,887 --> 01:32:13,408
Doctor?

1108
01:32:17,403 --> 01:32:19,552
You asshole!

1109
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,640
Doctor? Oh shit!

1110
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:24,618
Sorry, I though you were a...
You know...

1111
01:32:26,057 --> 01:32:28,042
- Come on.
- Let's go, Dad.

1112
01:32:32,241 --> 01:32:33,850
Here we go.

1113
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:45,792
Idriss!

1114
01:33:32,133 --> 01:33:33,479
OK.

1115
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:35,083
Take it easy...

1116
01:33:35,690 --> 01:33:37,192
Let me look at him.

1117
01:33:37,192 --> 01:33:38,581
Now...

1118
01:33:40,912 --> 01:33:42,187
Let's have a look.

1119
01:33:42,758 --> 01:33:46,670
That's not good. It's starting to weep.

1120
01:33:48,635 --> 01:33:50,858
That's very nasty indeed.

1121
01:33:51,976 --> 01:33:54,174
Gently! It hurt like a bastard!

1122
01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:00,451
No way!

1123
01:34:01,715 --> 01:34:04,267
Yeah, I took a while to find myself.

1124
01:34:04,776 --> 01:34:07,985
- Mullets were cool back then.
- That's no what I mean.

1125
01:34:07,985 --> 01:34:10,183
He came onto the pitch earlier.

1126
01:34:10,894 --> 01:34:13,975
- He contamined everyone.
- Jeannot?

1127
01:34:13,975 --> 01:34:14,825
Excuse me...

1128
01:34:16,387 --> 01:34:18,230
I'm going to fetch my bag.

1129
01:34:22,411 --> 01:34:24,883
What are you talking about?
He's really weedy.

1130
01:34:24,883 --> 01:34:26,939
No, he's a hulking great guy.

1131
01:34:31,528 --> 01:34:34,010
- Something's not right...
- What?

1132
01:35:24,459 --> 01:35:27,025
- What's got into you?
- Into me?

1133
01:35:27,025 --> 01:35:29,265
- You're crazy!
- You want to know?

1134
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:32,435
You destroyed my son's life,
is that OK for you?

1135
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:36,010
He never did anything with his life.
He became a loser.

1136
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:38,325
You could have brought him up to Paris.

1137
01:35:38,894 --> 01:35:41,730
You could have found him a little place.

1138
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:44,900
We could fix it...
- Shut up!

1139
01:35:45,907 --> 01:35:49,736
Quitter! Traitor! Ungrateful shit!
You never visited.

1140
01:35:50,804 --> 01:35:52,986
You never even sent a postcard,

1141
01:35:52,986 --> 01:35:55,326
or opened a supermarket. Nothing.

1142
01:35:57,319 --> 01:36:00,004
And you really made your dad suffer.

1143
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:00,854
That's true.

1144
01:36:02,608 --> 01:36:05,374
Sorry, Edouard. He is my son after all.

1145
01:36:05,994 --> 01:36:06,915
Fucking hell.

1146
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:15,878
I let everyone down.

1147
01:36:18,325 --> 01:36:19,672
Now's not the time.

1148
01:36:21,814 --> 01:36:23,729
It could've been different.

1149
01:36:24,699 --> 01:36:27,575
- I know I did some shit.
- Sam...

1150
01:36:27,575 --> 01:36:30,057
We should have done stuff together.

1151
01:36:33,919 --> 01:36:35,585
Let me talk.

1152
01:36:40,433 --> 01:36:41,141
In fact...

1153
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:44,775
What is it, Dad?

1154
01:36:44,775 --> 01:36:45,295
I...

1155
01:36:47,254 --> 01:36:48,246
I forgive you.

1156
01:36:50,245 --> 01:36:52,187
I love you.

1157
01:36:52,966 --> 01:36:54,438
I love you too, Dad.

1158
01:36:54,438 --> 01:36:57,979
You fucker! Sorry.

1159
01:36:58,999 --> 01:37:00,204
You son of bitch!

1160
01:37:01,046 --> 01:37:02,568
That's very rude, Dad.

1161
01:37:03,327 --> 01:37:06,447
Listen,
you have to promise me something...

1162
01:37:07,523 --> 01:37:10,586
Take care of little Cleo.

1163
01:37:10,586 --> 01:37:11,294
I promise.

1164
01:37:11,998 --> 01:37:15,330
Little cocksucker!
Oh fuck, that little whore!

1165
01:37:16,573 --> 01:37:18,665
Cleo's a little cocksucker!

1166
01:37:18,665 --> 01:37:20,027
What's wrong?

1167
01:37:20,027 --> 01:37:22,290
She sucks cocks, I swear it!

1168
01:37:22,290 --> 01:37:25,381
- Calm dawn.
- Get the fuck out of here!

1169
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:27,082
- I love you.
- Me too.

1170
01:37:27,772 --> 01:37:29,902
Fuck, fuck! Dirty whore!

1171
01:37:29,902 --> 01:37:33,062
- Get out of here! Go!
- Calm down, dad!

1172
01:37:33,062 --> 01:37:35,331
- Let's go!
- Get the fuck out!

1173
01:37:37,161 --> 01:37:38,579
Dirty fucking whore!

1174
01:37:39,886 --> 01:37:41,304
Disgusting little...

1175
01:38:11,031 --> 01:38:15,381
Paris, city of light,
Paris, city of shite.

1176
01:38:28,026 --> 01:38:32,489
Paris, capital city
Paris, city of shitty.

1177
01:38:32,489 --> 01:38:36,341
Paris, city of light,
Paris, city of shite.

1178
01:38:36,341 --> 01:38:37,972
Paris, Paris, fuck you!

1179
01:38:57,102 --> 01:38:58,377
Did you hear that?

1180
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:03,295
- Fuck, they stole our song!
- It's us, you idiot!

1181
01:39:04,624 --> 01:39:06,042
It's in the stadium.

1182
01:39:07,598 --> 01:39:10,482
We'll I never. Michael did it!

1183
01:39:10,482 --> 01:39:11,829
Didn't Michael die?

1184
01:39:13,401 --> 01:39:16,090
Yes. A bit.

1185
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:18,209
What do you mean, a bit?

1186
01:39:18,209 --> 01:39:21,525
His hand was going like that.

1187
01:39:22,109 --> 01:39:23,384
Like when you die.

1188
01:39:23,997 --> 01:39:26,686
- You left him there?
- I didn't know!

1189
01:39:26,686 --> 01:39:29,045
- You asshole, Teddy!
- Calm down.

1190
01:39:30,754 --> 01:39:33,139
We have to do something.

1191
01:39:35,991 --> 01:39:39,040
We have to go.
It's at the stadium, right?

1192
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,360
Stop following orders.

1193
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:44,445
Right?

1194
01:39:45,287 --> 01:39:48,424
Time to take charge, guys!

1195
01:39:48,424 --> 01:39:52,107
Show them what you're made of.
Make them take notice.

1196
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:55,858
Is Michel your friend or not?

1197
01:39:55,858 --> 01:39:57,276
- Yes.
- Of course.

1198
01:39:58,383 --> 01:40:00,690
So... No?

1199
01:40:03,715 --> 01:40:06,665
She's right, dammit.
Enough of being losers.

1200
01:40:07,445 --> 01:40:10,586
- Lets grab the hand of fate!
- Right!

1201
01:40:10,586 --> 01:40:12,997
Michel need us. Caplongue need us.

1202
01:40:16,315 --> 01:40:19,029
- Teddy?
- And me?

1203
01:40:19,919 --> 01:40:21,369
- What?
- Me.

1204
01:40:21,369 --> 01:40:23,195
I told your grandpa you'd stay here.

1205
01:40:23,195 --> 01:40:25,773
- What?
- I'm not taking a kid along.

1206
01:40:25,773 --> 01:40:27,280
- Me neither.
- Right.

1207
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,287
OK.

1208
01:40:29,434 --> 01:40:31,987
Know what you get for touching kids?

1209
01:40:32,839 --> 01:40:36,569
- What?
- 2, 3 years. Plus the trauma.

1210
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:39,174
What are you talking about?

1211
01:40:42,349 --> 01:40:44,125
They...

1212
01:40:45,535 --> 01:40:46,739
They forced me...

1213
01:40:48,185 --> 01:40:50,242
They were there with their...

1214
01:40:51,765 --> 01:40:53,376
I can't say it.

1215
01:40:55,374 --> 01:40:57,327
They broke me.

1216
01:40:58,182 --> 01:41:01,869
- I'll never be the same.
- OK, fine, you can come.

1217
01:42:02,686 --> 01:42:04,600
Gone to the Stadium.
Cleo.

1218
01:42:05,214 --> 01:42:06,490
She drives me mad!

1219
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:14,070
Give us a push.

1220
01:42:29,129 --> 01:42:30,763
Michel?

1221
01:42:37,578 --> 01:42:38,989
Bene?

1222
01:42:49,574 --> 01:42:51,660
Bene?

1223
01:42:55,835 --> 01:42:57,695
Hey, Fred!

1224
01:43:02,547 --> 01:43:04,438
Wait!

1225
01:43:04,438 --> 01:43:06,707
Am I standing up for myself now?

1226
01:43:25,427 --> 01:43:27,005
Michel!

1227
01:43:41,508 --> 01:43:42,967
Chloe?

1228
01:43:46,112 --> 01:43:47,814
Don't forget, because...

1229
01:43:48,428 --> 01:43:50,130
What did they do you do?

1230
01:43:54,805 --> 01:43:57,287
Not so hot now, are you, you idiot!

1231
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,776
What did you do to my daughter?

1232
01:44:07,776 --> 01:44:08,768
Your daughter?

1233
01:44:14,896 --> 01:44:16,984
My little Clio!

1234
01:44:16,984 --> 01:44:18,383
What the hell?

1235
01:44:18,383 --> 01:44:20,156
It's not Clio. It's Cleo.

1236
01:44:24,017 --> 01:44:25,221
I was so worried!

1237
01:44:25,858 --> 01:44:28,540
Wait, wait! I...

1238
01:44:31,909 --> 01:44:33,437
OK. OK.

1239
01:44:34,836 --> 01:44:35,898
Carole Pinchon.

1240
01:44:36,954 --> 01:44:39,719
A little blond bombshell,
a majorette.

1241
01:44:41,164 --> 01:44:42,582
To me, she was Coco.

1242
01:44:43,365 --> 01:44:45,421
I loved her. I had no idea...

1243
01:44:47,596 --> 01:44:49,324
Forgive me.

1244
01:44:50,118 --> 01:44:51,958
I'm sorry.

1245
01:44:56,168 --> 01:44:59,784
Hold on just a second.
I think I missed something.

1246
01:45:02,863 --> 01:45:06,621
By the way,
you're really rocking the warrior thing.

1247
01:45:07,714 --> 01:45:11,189
If you want to do that interview,
I'm up for it.

1248
01:45:11,739 --> 01:45:12,873
Idriss!

1249
01:45:12,873 --> 01:45:15,071
What? She's your chick as well?

1250
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:24,161
That's right. I'm his chick.

1251
01:45:25,426 --> 01:45:26,347
OK, I get it.

1252
01:45:26,904 --> 01:45:31,869
It's was the apocalypse,
so well get to screw whoever we want.

1253
01:45:32,745 --> 01:45:34,730
Is there anyone left for me?

1254
01:45:54,423 --> 01:45:54,943
Pitt!

1255
01:45:56,076 --> 01:45:58,893
Hey! You guys!

1256
01:45:58,893 --> 01:46:02,024
I'm in the booth. Over here!

1257
01:46:02,853 --> 01:46:05,264
They're going to see us, the fool!

1258
01:46:05,827 --> 01:46:07,608
I did it! It's great!

1259
01:46:07,608 --> 01:46:09,026
I'm one of you guys!

1260
01:46:09,604 --> 01:46:10,667
Come down here!

1261
01:46:11,717 --> 01:46:14,411
I don't understand you! Speak clearly!

1262
01:46:15,644 --> 01:46:17,487
I'm coming. I'm on my way.

1263
01:46:18,274 --> 01:46:20,188
Oh shit. Michel! Come down!

1264
01:46:41,107 --> 01:46:42,857
What's that?

1265
01:46:42,857 --> 01:46:44,985
Tonight at Lagrippe Stadium,

1266
01:46:45,668 --> 01:46:47,795
support your favourite team,

1267
01:46:48,387 --> 01:46:50,438
Caplongue!

1268
01:46:51,002 --> 01:46:54,477
And tonight...

1269
01:48:20,033 --> 01:48:21,530
Daddy!

1270
01:48:33,191 --> 01:48:36,487
- What do they want?
- What is it?

1271
01:48:37,482 --> 01:48:39,680
- What do they want?
- Soccer!

1272
01:48:45,634 --> 01:48:47,194
Let's give it to them.

1273
01:48:48,866 --> 01:48:50,792
Ready?
-OK.

1274
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,812
- No, no.
- It'll be fine.

1275
01:48:59,976 --> 01:49:01,399
Thanks.

1276
01:49:17,227 --> 01:49:19,576
Go on, Sam! Go on!

1277
01:49:43,713 --> 01:49:45,313
Dad!

1278
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:53,507
Run! Go for it!

1279
01:50:54,424 --> 01:50:55,487
Pitt! I did it!

1280
01:50:56,054 --> 01:50:57,329
I totally aced it!

1281
01:50:58,057 --> 01:50:59,974
That's, Pitt!

1282
01:50:59,974 --> 01:51:01,178
I'm one of yours!

1283
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:16,205
Sam!

1284
01:51:18,786 --> 01:51:20,346
Don't leave me behind!

1285
01:51:21,156 --> 01:51:22,006
Wait for me!

1286
01:51:24,143 --> 01:51:25,973
Look out!

1287
01:51:32,621 --> 01:51:35,703
Paris Olympique!
Paris is magic!

1288
01:51:38,591 --> 01:51:39,725
I fucked him up!

1289
01:51:40,428 --> 01:51:43,017
I fucked him up, Sam!

1290
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:49,881
Hey, Jeannot!

1291
01:51:55,572 --> 01:51:57,061
Jeannot, it's Samuel.

1292
01:52:01,408 --> 01:52:03,890
Wait, Jeannot. I know you're mad...

1293
01:52:05,004 --> 01:52:06,990
Can't we just talk about it?

1294
01:52:08,273 --> 01:52:11,467
Ok. I did a really shitty thing.

1295
01:52:14,165 --> 01:52:16,670
Maybe you don't care now...

1296
01:52:17,810 --> 01:52:19,582
But I want you to know,

1297
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:23,989
I never found a friend like you.

1298
01:52:27,816 --> 01:52:30,796
You were right. Paris is crap.

1299
01:52:31,536 --> 01:52:33,606
This is our home.

1300
01:52:35,216 --> 01:52:37,059
We'll be together now, OK?

1301
01:52:45,113 --> 01:52:46,594
Jeannot?

1302
01:52:58,035 --> 01:52:59,904
Open up!

1303
01:53:24,751 --> 01:53:26,525
Hey, Teddy?

1304
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:30,972
- Popeye?
- That right. Are you OK?

1305
01:53:31,569 --> 01:53:32,419
How are you?

1306
01:53:33,126 --> 01:53:35,701
Fine.
You take soccer seriously round here.

1307
01:53:35,701 --> 01:53:36,850
Can we go now?

1308
01:53:36,850 --> 01:53:38,953
Sure. Jump in.

1309
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:52,047
Who's that talking?

1310
01:53:53,884 --> 01:53:54,946
Is it the army?

1311
01:53:55,561 --> 01:53:57,688
I told you I had their number.

1312
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,587
I don't believe it!

1313
01:54:41,863 --> 01:54:45,846
Hey Cleo. You ever seen
the Eiffel Tower in real life?

1314
01:54:45,846 --> 01:54:47,619
You fancy going together?

1315
01:54:48,994 --> 01:54:51,648
I'd love it.

1316
01:54:51,648 --> 01:54:54,999
That huge steel tower,
so fragile and powerful...

1317
01:54:54,999 --> 01:54:55,991
To me, it's...

1318
01:54:56,603 --> 01:54:58,446
You never shut up, do you?

1319
01:55:01,545 --> 01:55:08,014
***wiowood, kendari 8/10/2014***

1320
01:56:27,179 --> 01:56:28,668
Welcome to Caplongue!

1321
01:56:29,210 --> 01:56:31,195
This is the bar I took over.

1322
01:56:31,726 --> 01:56:34,919
I hired my childhood pals
to lend a hand.

1323
01:56:34,919 --> 01:56:37,335
It was tricky to start,
but we get along now.

1324
01:56:37,335 --> 01:56:39,043
Just a question of approach.

1325
01:56:39,043 --> 01:56:41,241
Paulo! Can you bring me a beer?

1326
01:56:42,356 --> 01:56:44,432
Yeah, that's great.

1327
01:56:44,432 --> 01:56:46,149
That's the right glass.

1328
01:56:46,149 --> 01:56:49,048
Go no, show us what you do.

1329
01:56:50,548 --> 01:56:52,391
Now, what do you do first?

1330
01:56:53,511 --> 01:56:57,020
There you go, that;s good, Paulo.

1331
01:56:57,829 --> 01:56:58,821
That'll do OK.

1332
01:56:59,586 --> 01:57:02,023
OK, here we go.

1333
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:06,708
Stop! Stop!

1334
01:57:08,351 --> 01:57:10,197
What a barman, huh?
