There is a string of lights in that box.

105
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,270
This box?

106
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,670
This is only sealant

107
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,410
What?
Sealant.

108
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,880

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,790
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,160
The award-winning cameraman.

117
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,100
From outer space.

118
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,230
Pope.

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,270
Where did you get that? It is giant.
It's so big.

120
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,740
It is very large.

00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,880

00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,680

But this is old...

127
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,760
There are traces in the lights and
I see a kind of...

128
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,360
Strangely in the middle of the room like a blur
.

129
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,800
I think is out of focus.

130
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,700
This is so great.

131
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,940
What?
It is so extrarïo

132
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,540
I'm seeing something in the other room.

133
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,440
Probably only this old.

134
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,580
It is strange.

135
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,150
Is so strange.

136
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,890
It seemed to be under water when from here.

137
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,170
What are receiving this camera?

138
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,700

139
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,680
Mike is going to go crazy with this.

140
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,320
Okay affection

141
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,150

First the closet. I'm going here.

143
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,230
The closet seems fine.

144
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,660
Under the bed.

145
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,300
I do not see anything except you.

146
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,330
I see a television.
I do not see a TV

147
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,500
There is no TV in your room. Lila.

148
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,940
You mean in the shop
pink bell?

149
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,240
Everything is ready here. One last thing.

150
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,180
You can stop this.
But that heavy is this.

151
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,810
Sleep well. Sweet Dreams.

152
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,510

153
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,720

extras that go to sleep gifts.

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,150
Good night, baby. I love you.

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,450

157
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:52,930
Ryan.

158
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,690
You coming to bed?

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,130
Now I can not see that thing
. I think he's gone.

160
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,270
Well, great. The fixed it.
Come to bed. Leave that to Matiana.

161
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,130
No. Do not fix anything.

162
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,040
We went upstairs. I came back.
And now it has completely gone.

163
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,640
If you come to bed now
your wife is going to have sex with you.

164
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,380
Sex?
Also.

165
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,010
... I... I'll have sex with you.

166
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,220
Anti That was sexy.

167
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,050
Okay. I'm going there.

168
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,360
This thing is absolutely spectacular.

169
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,690
Looks pretty spectacular.
I know.

170
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,330
The thing is... you found anything?

171
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,630
Is completely original.

172
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,770
I've been like 15 websites.
And nothing looks like this camera.

173
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,140
This usually has 3  photo tubes.

174
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,270
This has 6.
Oh, God mi'o.

175
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,480
It seems to have as a multiple range
approach.

176
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,310
I see arrows to focus.

177
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,350
But this here
Ol.

178
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,010
I have no idea what it does.

179
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,950
By
much you like this? It's just a camera.

180
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,020
I do not know. I was in my house.
I have never seen any of this.

181
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,620
This case... I have never before seen. Mike.

182
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,160
This type ...

183
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,970
Definitely...

184
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,370
Hey, Dad.
Hey.

185
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,570
It is the same thing?
Who were you talking about?

186
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,140
My friend.
Your friend?

187
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,850
Where is your friend?

188
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,550
Pope. I play the hidden
. Count to ten.

189
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,290
Count to ten.
It's okay.

190
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,230
One.

191
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,130
Two.

192
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,730
Très .

193
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,870
Where did he go?

194
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,300
Well, the girls came out this
night. We have the house to ourselves.

195
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,740
Why do not you take the night off?

196
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,770
I have to finish this game
before Christmas Day. friend.

197
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,540
Was checking my bursa.
Yes? What did you find? Your underwear?

198
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,280
I have a little souvenir of my trip to Belgium.

199
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,210
Good Belgian chocolate ..

200
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,280
Wrapped in foil?

201
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,720
Believe me. Does not look much...
You've been in your pocket for weeks.

202
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,850
It's not about the presentation.
They put a lot of time in the chocolate.

203
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,560
Ryan. for real?
I expect it is because of me.

204
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,730
And I appreciate it.
You know very well.

205
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,090
I've been living with you for long.

206
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,430
Fair enough. I swear to God.

207
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,930
You can eat.

208
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,310
You're talking about.

209
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,280
Santa is the best.

210
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,510
He has a festive attitude.

211
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,480
Simply
work one night and fly with his sleigh.

212
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,550
With magical deer. Sign me.

213
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,390
I want to be like Santa.

214
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,830
Why still have a VHS...
I ever tell you

215
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,790
Old pornography steal potatoes?

216
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,960
And needed a way to see this, so...

217
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,970
Oh, he had so many European rare.

218
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,270
It is where the guy
eggs tied with leather.

219
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,940
All are from 88 to 92?
I do not know.

220
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,840
Let's see what we have here.
Yes.

221
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,950
Lie back.

222
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,350
It's not your house, man. Where is that?
I do not know.

223
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,020
88
88.

224
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,860
There he is.
Oh my goodness. This will be so sexy.

225
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:48,090
Why are we seeing? Oh, God rrrio.

226
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,130
Shoulders. I am a kind of shrugged.

227
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,440
Oh, no.

228
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,200
Here is where it gets really good.

229
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,170
No Mores.

230
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,380
Back to where was your Marna.

231
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,310
Goodbye.

232
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,210
What horror

233
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,650
Tell me when you return  women.

234
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,720
I'll put another tape.

235
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,550
Find someone with small shoulders.

236
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,120
Cbmo go play?

237
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,820
Who is winning?

238
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,290
Why are not you talking about?

239
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,490
I'm one of you.

240
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,800
I think this...

241
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,530
It's wild, man.

242
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,940
If?

243
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,440
Now I put another tape.
Let's see those shoulders.

244
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,510
Are you sure you're ready for this?

245
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,080
Oh, my God. This is perfect.

246
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,920
's An earthquake.
Oh shit.

247
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,180
's An earthquake.

248
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,650
No. No. No.
's an earthquake.

249
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,450
What is this?

250
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,260
How about a inside?

251
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,930
They filmed everything?
This could be a porno.

252
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,060
Okay.
Think of it.

253
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,130
Well, Christi. Do not use your eyes to see.

254
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,500
Use what is within you.
This is something different.

255
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,240
I'm doing, mesmerizing?

256
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,740
Focus Christi.

257
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,180
I need you to concentrate.
Concentrate on that, Christi?

258
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,580
Your time  through it, Christi.
Let me show you what he sees.

259
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,880
What the hell...

260
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,480
Let it take you there.

261
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,050
Let me show you.

262
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,820
I hate this family.
One room.

263
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,730
This girl is taking minutes?

264
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,770
Many colors.

265
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,200
I also see colors, man.

266
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,770
Butterflies.

267
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,640
There is a large bird in the door.

268
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,280
Why are you laughing?

269
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,880
There is a tent.

270
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
A tent?
Than?

271
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,690
Ryan?
As where we camped.

272
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,030
Entered the room of the girl.

273
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,900
Why are you looking like this?

274
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,070
Think I missed?

275
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,370
A teddy bear half the
room. Butterflies. A bird on the wall.

276
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,680
You sound familiar?

277
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,680
Bored?
She described Lila's room, Mike.

278
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,680
No brother, what happens? Are you high.
Mike. is describing

279
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,820
Lila's room.
Corniste more chocolate than me?

280
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,690
Is there, Christi?

281
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,720
Ryan. please. and turn it off.

282
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,790
It's in the room?

283
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,030
Is in the house?

284
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,170
Can you see it?

285
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,400
Why do the forces? Who is EP

286
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,780
Is there.

287
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,910
You stepped on something.
Are u serious?

288
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,550
No, do not disconnect anything.
What was that, a fuse?

289
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,150
By using that old cassette player?
The electricity returned.

290
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,390
How odd.

291
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,230
You hear that?
Yes.

292
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,590
Come With Me or .
Bring your camera. Go see your own.

293
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,060
According .

294
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Focus. I want you to concentrate, Ryan.
Shut up.
I'm imitating video.

295
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,870
Wait, that's the same thing the other night?

296
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,780
Where did he go?

297
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,830
Mike.

298
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,040
Mike.

299
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,470
Mike, it's not funny. Are you?

300
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,360
Shit.

301
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,900
Mike? Mike, are you?

302
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,110
Mike?
It scared me a lot, Mike.

303
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,350
Ryan  think...

304
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,680
This is rare.
I think my camera begins to see.

305
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I think I'm seeing something
It is a.
A jerk.

306
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,290
You saw the jerk?

307
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,590
There participate of imbecility in your aura, no?

308
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,400
This  around you. You're a jerk.

309
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,300
There they are.
Hello.

310
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,370
Hello love.
Like that?

311
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,710
Estan?
Is Uncle Mike.

312
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,540
That's not good.

313
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,040
Wait.
Mike looks like a huge pile of...

314
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,510
I do not look like me at all.

315
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,950
And that's what you do for a living?

316
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,480
It is similar to Feng Shui.
Is moving furniture.

317
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,650
So that no energy is blocked.

318
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,190
Should do with your home.

319
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,030
Hey.
Why?

320
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,690
Feel different
Your energy is blocked Mike?

321
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,900
I flow smoothly.

322
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,330
If you want to release my energy.

323
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,640
I... no longer what we mean.

324
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,740
Tell them... Tell them
night we had.

325
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,910
Was just...

326
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,950
We saw and heard strange things.

327
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,720
I heard about photographing spirits.
But I have not seen one in person.

328
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,160
What do you see?

329
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,600
Only  forms.
Could be a spirit. I suppose.

330
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,330
Usually these cameras do not see spirits.

331
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,800
Rather other pianos of existence.

332
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,170
Places where energy would travel displaced.

333
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,380
But it also might not function.

334
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,140
I do not know, it's weird.
But I do not think it's a failure.

335
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,780
I saw Lila's room and then

336
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,620
He was in the hallway.

337
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,690
Hey. Lila is asleep. And let us go.

338
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,590
Back at 11. Good night.

339
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,390
Hey, watch the camera.

340
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,090
Seriously.
Relax Ryan

341
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,760
I just want to see what it does.

342
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,260
You do not seriously think or see ghosts?

343
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,230
Si. I think it's very possible.

344
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,700
What?

345
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,210
The lights look beautiful with this.

346
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,480
You should try them with fungi.
Yes, I need wine.

347
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,610
Sure.

348
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,880
Red, white, Cabernet?
Pink.

349
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,020
Sauvignon.

350
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,690
Right back.

351
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hello

352
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,280
Is anyone there?

353
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,220
Hey, you scared me.

354
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,450
Just me. I have the wine.

355
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,820
I think there's something here.
Than?

356
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,390
I think I felt something.

357
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,860
Ah. Yes?
Yes. Look through the camera

358
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,190
But I saw nothing.

359
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,030
They turn themselves off. Wait, I think that has night vision
.

360
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,530
There he is.

361
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It Must have been the wind.

362
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,250
You see something?

363
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,080
No.

364
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,860
Mike. do you see?

365
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,590
I go inside now.

366
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,140
What the hell is that?

367
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,940
Flew out of the pool.
Shut. You'll scare him.

368
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,910
What? I'll scare him?

369
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,710
Let's go.

370
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,180
Give me the camera.

371
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,280
What is this?

372
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Mike  something here.
This is crazy.

373
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,740
Lila.

374
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,910
Hello beautiful. What are you doing here? It's cold.

375
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,950
Come inside.
It's cold. Let's go

376
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
What the fuck

377
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,000
The pool was weird, but she was scared
more.

378
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,810
Perhaps we saw something,
but that camera is useless.

379
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,340
We turned the corner.

380
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,610
We turned and was there.

381
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,080
They asked what to here?

382
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,510
It was like in a coma. I do not know if you heard.

383
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,750
If it is sleepwalking. I do not know what I was doing.

384
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,490
Not sleepwalker. Always sleeps well

385
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,850
Hey look at this.

386
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,490
If?
There is heard here.

387
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,830
This is yours? Hey if

388
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,000
It is my rosary.

389
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,000
How odd
The burying saw these things here?

390
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,070
No. we did not see. But it is possible.

391
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,040
What are you doing?
You know papa has a new toy?

392
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,210
As you've got yours.
Yes.

393
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,320
Turns out my toy...

394
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,090
She saw something very interesting last night.

395
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,860
I think...

396
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,390
I think.

397
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,400
And you do not feel anything?

398
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,870
I do not want to talk about it.

399
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,240
About who love?

400
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,510
What does this button do?

401
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,020
The spiritual photography.

402
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,180
Hello?

403
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,900
Hello.

404
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,340
Hello?

405
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,380
What happens to me? I'm going crazy.

406
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,180
Lila. what are you doing here?

407
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,480
Carino. that's blood?

408
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,820
You have in your hands? You're bleeding?

409
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,320
What happened?

410
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,230
Daughter, answer me, what happened? You're bleeding?

411
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,420
You're saying?

412
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I do not know.

413
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,790
You hear that?

414
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,600
This talking backwards.
Bloody Mary said.

415
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,170
That which signif'ca?
It's a game. Niiios a game.

416
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,240
What kind? The game originally

417
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,870
You say it three times.
then he appears and tells you who you're going to marry.

418
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,340
But when I played,
as most plays.

419
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,750
You say your name  très times, and a damn
witch appears and takes you by the neck.

420
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,620
As Lila heard of that game?

421
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,050
No way.

422
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,120
I have no idea.
Old were you when you played?

423
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,760
I do not know. Was a girl. Such
once they told her friends.

424
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,430
Come see.
Than?

425
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,790
Look at this. Look.

426
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,500
Come see. Decode the case.

427
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,100
I look?
This Trente look.

428
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,930
Lived here? It uramente
.

429
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,070
But why you are here? Of 87

430
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,370
It is the same house where they recorded everything.

431
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,940
The place was burned in 92.

432
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,310
No bodies were recovered.

433
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,640
Whole family disappeared, including.

434
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,910
Including their hij as Katy and Christi.

435
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,620
And you think our daughter

436
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,950
Is talking to ghosts.

437
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,020
Elias being awakened in the night
. Playing with something that only she

438
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,460
And the camera can see.

439
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,260
The nirios are.
Not mean they have ghost.

440
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,630
Those who lived here
20 years ago, they put cameras

441
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,300
And they caught all kinds of crazy things.

442
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,670
And our house is built on them.

443
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,240
It's a joke of you and Mike?

444
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,240
No, look at this.
I feel that every time Mike comes

445
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,640
They are crazy to do together.

446
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,580
No. Not so. I swear.

447
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,510
I just want to know if there is something here

448
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,410
Or if I'm going crazy.

449
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,680
I'm going to feel better.

450
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,980
Well, I do

451
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,750
If? I can do it?
Have permission.

452
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,490
But not for many days.

453
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,860
As Mike. With this will suffice.

454
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,260
You put two cameras?
Is that is the control

455
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,530
To see if it is recording something special.

456
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,900
We have to turn the other here.

457
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,300
Just you gonna see your daughter sleep all night
. Nothing unusual about that.

458
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,210
Oche December 2013

459
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,140
2 dicieabre oche 2013

460
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,700
Okay.

461
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,910
Okay.

462
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,050
Where?

463
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,580
Lila, that doing up?

464
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,050
It is very cold here.

465
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,520
Snuggle right, Lila.

466
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,460
Let me help.

467
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,760
Try to sleep.

468
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,900
What was that?

469
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,110
No problem.

470
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,580
Well, Lila.

471
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,550
Go to bed, good night, okay?

472
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,680
Now he goes to sleep.

473
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,970
Hello my love. I saw something in your room last night
you and Skyler aunt.

474
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,000
Linda?

475
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,870
What woke you last night?

476
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,740
Tobi did.

477
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,310
Tobi did?

478
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,310
Who is Tobi?

479
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,380
Lila, who is Tobi?

480
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,590
Lila?

481
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,590
There was a dark shape that was floating

482
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,930
I call and Tobi.

483
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,200
Not given any fear.

484
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,970
And I know it sounds strange, but I think it's our
ghost.

485
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,140
Emily  believe me crazy. But remember that you
comment

486
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,340
Lila said Tobi awoke last night?

487
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,610
Well look at this.

488
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,340
88. Is the

489
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,310
Do not sit there. Tobi is the place.

490
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,710
Oh. forgiveness. Tobi is sitting now?

491
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,880
Are talking about Tobi. Sorry
Tobi.

492
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,220
Is it a coincidence.
And in 4 years.

493
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,560
The girls grew up a little and we
ponytail.

494
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,160
Here comes.

495
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,270
So they kept contact...
Tobi.

496
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,570
That pretty.
No Mike.

497
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,270
This is before Facebook.
It is hard to keep in touch with people.

498
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,910
Think it's a boy or girl?

499
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,640
Because Tobi would be a great name
stripper.

500
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,280
In our center court.

501
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,350
Strong applause. It is Tobi.

502
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,950
Listen to the bed if it works.

503
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,790
Record things that others do not.
It is crap. You hear?

504
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,490
Addition Tobi is not a common name.

505
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,420
Perhaps she saw the video.
Mike is very pequeha.

506
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,890
You have no idea who is a VHS.

507
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,170
You think was there, shoved and gave
play? Found the cassette think?

508
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,830
You make me feel old.
The children do not know is VHS.

509
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,940
What is that?

510
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,210
You heard?

511
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,940
Really?
Yes. Ryan.

512
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,410
These seeing something?

513
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,050
What is that?
That viewing something?

514
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,680
Ryan.
Than?

515
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,320
I think is...
freezer making ice.

516
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,520
Do not give me...
A Tobi likes the ice?

517
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,090
We should remove it from the freezer.

518
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,460
Perhaps this is why a bad mood.
Is too coincidental.

519
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,900
's What I think.

520
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,500
Mike.
Shut up, everyone is asleep.

521
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,070
That noise came from beyond Ryan.

522
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,370
Well, give me the camera. Give me the camera.

523
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,820
Mike. there is something up. But it's different.

524
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,420
It moves.

525
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,590
Ryan, let's go. You'll wake her.

526
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,600
So I want to see where it went.

527
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,520
Can you see anything?

528
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,690
No. I'm not sensing anything.

529
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,100
God!

530
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,840
Daddy what are you doing?

531
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,870
Pardon my love.

532
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,240
Sorry, sorry. Everything is fine. Quiet.

533
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,580
Back to sleep.

534
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,350
I cry because...
Your strong yelled.

535
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Your you yelled before the face of your daughter
. Also shout. I could not see anything.
You know who shouts Mike?
Why?
Because I saw this with the camera.
It looks more concentrated.
Have more shape. This dark.

536
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,560
And Mike. I felt this thing through me.

537
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,070
I think it's a face.

538
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,900
It's not human but is crazy.

539
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,140
Why we still need two cameras here?

540
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,810
Not just a camera covering the room well.

541
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,280
This
talking to her and telling her to do things.

542
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,580
And not alone in his room.
It is moving around the house.

543
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,980
I just want to know where you are going and wants.

544
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,050
This better.

00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:42,330
December 2013

546
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,960
What are you doing? Put that down. Let it go.

547
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,860
What are you doing?

548
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,330
You can not play with matches
or turning on the gas.

549
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,370
What were you thinking?

550
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

551
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,260
Ryan. Ryan.

552
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,800
This is my bible. Always up.

553
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,600
I was in the fireplace.

554
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,840
's What I wanted to burn.

555
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,980
The rosary
treatment was also burning in the fireplace.

556
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,320
What kind of game is played with matches?

557
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,550
He said he was playing a game with Julie.

558
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,620
Only use the first one I found.
She sabla you had the book up there, you probably know where this
.
He does not even know it.

559
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,030
She sabla you had the book up there, you probably know where this
.

560
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:08,560
I do not know. I went to bed, return here.
The angel is then falls.

561
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,430
I do not know, I went to bed and when
And then the angel falls.
Got things had fallen.
I do not know. I went to bed, return here.

562
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:13,870

563
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,970
No, it does not seem like her.
I do not know. There she seems.

564
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,140
It seems to be different.

565
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,240
It seems to be different.
And I did not want to believe it but I think Ryan is right.
It seems to be different.

566
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,470
It seems to be different.
And I did not want to believe it but I think Ryan is right.

567
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,510
Initially
perhaps not believe it, but Ryan is right.
It seems to be different.
And I did not want to believe it but I think Ryan is right.

568
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:22,770
It seems to be different.
And I did not want to believe it but I think Ryan is right.

569
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,140
There is something in our house.
There is something in our house.

Okay? And mom and dad want to talk

And marl and potato
no longer want to talk to him.
It's okay? And mom and dad want to talk
no more with him.

581
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:46,430
And marl and potato
no longer want to talk to him.

582
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,670
Lee promised you'd stop talking. You promise me
'll stop talking to Tobi?

583
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,340

Good.
I promise.

587
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,710
So the tapes start at 88.

588
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,050
A lot of things for Christmas
and live with their marl.

589
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,750
Sure

590
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:10,620
I have not seen them all. but suddenly jumps
footage and everything is different.

591
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,620
6No see anything, just...? No.

592
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,330
Mom and boyfriend
are totally absent in the video.

593
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,870
... They are gone anywhere?
Not appear in any tape.

594
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,840
And it's like this weird cult
deal with these girls now.

595
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,900
And Maman Marna this other woman.
6Qué is that, a milk Baho?

596
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,340
Who are these people? Oh my God.

597
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:37,520
It Is  I had another dream.
And fell on the stairs.

598
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,590
Toby says that since these Carino way.
These progressing well.

599
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,760
6Qué all mean?
I do not know. But such is their leader.

600
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,430
It is as if the girls
prepare for something.

601
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,600
The need them.
We approached.

602
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:56,630

00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,000
I try to see if there is a connection.
6Son that we saw the other night?

606
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:32,670
No, it's a different night, but does the same
. Literally they do.

607
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:35,910
Every night, like a ritual.
Not a normal home video.

608
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,040
It's like a training tape.

609
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:43,550
6TE what this show?
I'm not sure. It is very fuzzy.

610

612
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,660
Is so blurry.

613
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,100
I see... a TV.

614
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,670

615
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:11,240

Colleague , <j, what the hell?

623
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,310

00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,920
Expected, play it again.
Look, put it slower.

637
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,360
Lee sneezes and she says "Health".

638
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,960
These people, I think watching us.
And these tapes are from 20 years ago...

639
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,230
But they can see what happens here with us
and Leela.

640
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,660
6Todo  I have to do is draw?

My God.
What is all this?

643
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,090
I not think they're just random.
I think there's a pattern.

644
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:41,090
Some are made known to me.
I know I've seen this before.

645
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,630
Emily, these symbols on the wall
are on tape too.

646
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,570
Were in the room the girls. And that there
symbol is used by a coven...

647
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:51,240
Ilamado midwives.
... What are witches?

648
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,700
These midwives egan to the Middle Ages.

649
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,780
Emily, they were in worship the devil.
Also used symbols to open...

650
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,940
Carries them to different places and times.

651
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,510
My God.
I know.

652
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:09,990
What is that?

653
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:13,960
I do not know.

654
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,070
What is that?

655
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:26,640
Lee.

656
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,510
There's something different with her.

657
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,590
Lee.
What the hell

658
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,990

665
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,860
What the hell.

666
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:30,800
What is that?
No, I see nothing.

667
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:48,850
There is nothing out.

668
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:57,030

669
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,740
Hello.

Well I will call again at four.

672
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,020
She's been acting weird
and more and more things have been happening...

673
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,390
We not know what to do.

674
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,730
Ten other.

675
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,340
Have a special baby.
So is.

676
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,770
It will. You remember what happened last night at
your room when you were in the corner?

677
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,680
Well...

678
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:56,090

683
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,960
Hello. I'm Emily.

684
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,400
We are so grateful that you came
, thank you very much.

685
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,540
I just hope poderles help.
Yes. I think it can. And we explain.

686
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:51,010
This camera captures
things that none of the other sees. It is crazy.

687
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:55,410
sure nothing unusual happened in a house before?

688
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:58,220
No.
I view this camera tapes...

689
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,950
Those who are 20 years.
It is as if they too will use the camera...

690
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,260
To see these things too.
Father, see this.

691
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,830
I started small and
thought it was a failure.

692
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,130
It is dark when the camera focuses.

693
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,860
And big, as if it grew more.

694
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:19,970
Has anyone ever experienced this before
elsewhere?

695
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,210
Nothing like that. Y
found these tapes these...

696
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:25,480
Girls playing Bloody Mary.
The same game Leela played the other night.

697
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:27,850
6de where he learned that?

698
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,220
They recorded themselves doing all these weird rituals
.

699
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:35,750
You do it very well.
Toby will be so proud of you.

700
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,060
They believe that this is the Toby
Leela speaks?

701
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:38,990
Si. We think so.

702

As described and what I know, which is very little
...

707
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:06,980
It seems as if her daughter was harassed by a demon
or demonic presence.

708
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:10,020
If this is so we should go.
Leave house.

We have to go, right? We have to go.

Spirits do not haunt houses, but
people. If you leave this house will follow.

711
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,730
Demons feed on fear.
The more attention given.

715
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,330

716
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:54,230

00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,160
Cursed  useless cure.

729
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:36,170
After what the father said
I went back and researched further.

730
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,900
I found this tape in the camera.
I thought it was blank, but look.

Three days before we moved.
You hear?
I believe that the leader is speaking.
No, perhaps only a contractor or someone
.

733
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,620
6Ves he talks about the house?
It Is all of what he speaks.

734
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,260
No, says entry point.
The fact that we moved to this...

735
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:05,000
Home in specific
all that we saw did not seem coincidental to me.

736
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:10,200
No, no, no Higgens. Hubber.
H-U-B-B.

737
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:14,100
Exactly Hubber. Katie Hubber,
is what I've been trying to tell.

They say you never heard of it.

00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,030
No one ever heard from her.

744
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,230
But that's... that's...

745
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:47,500
What if.
If someone put us here on purpose?

746
