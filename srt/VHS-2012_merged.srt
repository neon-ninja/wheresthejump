1
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:21,440
Back up. Back up, back up.
Turn around, turn around.

2
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,441
Oh, yeah.

3
00:01:44,862 --> 00:01:46,665
There they are.

4
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:04,447
Show her tits!

5
00:02:08,352 --> 00:02:10,324
Stop!

6
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:15,425
Oh, shit! Run, run, run!
Go, go, go!

7
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:21,604
- It's cool?
- Hell, yeah.

8
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:05,952
Yeah!

9
00:03:13,952 --> 00:03:16,429
All right, watch your head, dude.

10
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:25,769
It's all right.

11
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,905
I got it, I got it.

12
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:35,241
It's all right.

13
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:37,910
I'll just fuckin' find
you a better camera.

14
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:39,613
That's not a better camera
than this camera.

15
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:42,415
Man, I'm gonna draw
two balls at once.

16
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:49,255
What tape are you filming on?

17
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:50,522
- Do what?
- What tape are you filming on?

18
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:52,358
What the fuck are you
talking about, dude?

19
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:54,766
Where'd you get the tape?
What's on the label?

20
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't know.
It was in your room.

21
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,970
- But you don't know.
- Lights, lights, lights!

22
00:04:03,972 --> 00:04:06,773
Come on, come on, come on!

23
00:04:10,645 --> 00:04:12,912
- Stop!
- Show her tits!

24
00:04:12,913 --> 00:04:15,482
See? That is exactly
why I picked her.

25
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:17,383
She has great fuckin' tits.

26
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:20,621
Oh, you just knew
'cause you're a boob psychic.

27
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:23,024
Yeah, well, we've
done this so many times.

28
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:26,326
Dude, we get $50 every time
we do one of these things.

29
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:27,560
I can get us more
than 50 bucks, man.

30
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,029
I mean, that's
not bad for this...

31
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,030
fifty dollars for
each time we do this.

32
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:32,567
Dude, tell him about
the deal that you got.

33
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:34,768
We hooked up with,
like, a reality porn place.

34
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,636
Have you actually got paid?

35
00:04:36,637 --> 00:04:39,039
Has he said he'd
pay you, like, money?

36
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,607
Twenty-five,
thirty times, yeah.

37
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:42,275
I can get us more money
than that in one night.

38
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:43,777
How you gonna get
more money than that?

39
00:04:43,778 --> 00:04:45,981
You can drop this fuckin'
pawnshop shit right now,

40
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:47,649
if you want.

41
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:47,950
We need to do skirts.

42
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,884
Like, this coming summer.

43
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:52,519
Hey, shut the fuck up, man.

44
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,391
And run by and do... you
know, like, up-skirt stuff.

45
00:04:57,926 --> 00:05:01,629
Shut the fuck up, dudes! We
can get more money than that!

46
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,699
<i>What the hell, Gary? God damn!</i>

47
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,708
Get more than
that in one night!

48
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:16,914
Okay, go up left here and
head towards Ryback road.

49
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:20,616
Okay, here's the deal:

50
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:22,552
We've gotta break
into this house,

51
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:26,421
and all we have to do is
steal this one vhs tape.

52
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:28,422
Dude, let's use
that fuckin' tape.

53
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:30,961
<i>Why don't you use that tape?</i>

54
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:33,428
Naw, man, let's use the tape.

55
00:05:33,429 --> 00:05:34,695
Yeah, we got a tape right here.

56
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:35,999
Dude ain't gotta check it!

57
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:41,102
Anyways, the job pays,
so, like...

58
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:42,837
It could lead to more work.

59
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:43,973
Work?!

60
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:45,741
Anyway, he also said

61
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:48,977
he saw some of your stuff
online, so you have a fan.

62
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:50,645
How's that work, man?

63
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:53,918
<i>We don't put our names
on any of this shit.</i>

64
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,051
I don't know. I don't know.

65
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:58,455
I wouldn't worry about it.

66
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:01,824
Hey, you got crumbs
in your beard.

67
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:05,733
Yeah, sure. No problem.

68
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:10,567
What's that?

69
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:12,701
- What are you talking about?
- Is that your camera?

70
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:15,484
- What camera? What are you talking about?
- What the fuck?!

71
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:30,056
Hey, rock, hey, can you hold
my camera for a second?

72
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:34,499
Be careful. Be careful, okay?

73
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:43,167
Dude, this nigger's house
is a mansion.

74
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:44,502
He must be goddamn rich!

75
00:06:47,071 --> 00:06:49,774
Hey. Hey. Who stays here?

76
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:50,875
Some old guy.

77
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:52,509
Like, some old guy's
here right now?

78
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,877
Some old guy's here right now,

79
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:56,515
and he's fucking sleeping,
so you've got to stay quiet.

80
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,782
Wait a minute. Wait, wait.
What if he wakes up?

81
00:06:58,783 --> 00:07:00,984
Well, I'll fucking take
care of that, I guess.

82
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:04,188
Yeah, I'll take care of that.

83
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:06,727
Just shut your
fucking mouth, man.

84
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,067
You're not gonna do
anything about it.

85
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,577
Jesus.

86
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,777
Hey.

87
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,879
You two go upstairs, and we're
gonna look around down here.

88
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,572
Fuckin' go up there.

89
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,154
Shut the fuck up, dude.

90
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,725
Where the fuck is this tape?

91
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,275
Everything's pretty much
empty in here.

92
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

93
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,746
Fuck, what?!

94
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:35,182
What the fuck...?

95
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:38,184
What the fuck, dude?

96
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,095
Oh, shit!

97
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,197
- Fuck.
- He's dead, man.

98
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:52,164
- What?
- I figure he's dead.

99
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:55,001
No fuckin' way.

100
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,675
Oh, man, he smells.

101
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:01,843
Gary!

102
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:05,751
What the fuck?
Why are they yelling?

103
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:14,222
Shut the fuck up.

104
00:09:14,223 --> 00:09:16,290
You keep telling me
to shut the fuck up, dude.

105
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,127
Look at all this.
Look at all this.

106
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:21,329
He's dead.

107
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,696
Don't touch the dude.

108
00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:22,965
What did you fuckin' do to him?

109
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:25,801
Hey, Gary, Gary.
They took care of it.

110
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:28,268
Who took care? Fuck you!
Who took care of him?

111
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:33,339
- Shut the fuck up!
- There ain't no tape.

112
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:36,681
Gary, there ain't
no tape. Just take this.

113
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:39,114
Let's check all these.

114
00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:41,150
I told them to keep looking.

115
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:42,918
Did you look in
the fucking machines?

116
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:46,988
Hey, let's go... hey, Gary.

117
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:49,793
Yeah?
Let's check out the basement.

118
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:53,297
Tryin' to find
the fuckin' tape, dude.

119
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:57,365
Brad, Brad, Brad.

120
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:59,100
- What?
- Stay with me, man.

121
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:00,636
Fuck, no. You stay in here.

122
00:10:00,637 --> 00:10:02,272
Those tapes haven't
been checked, dude.

123
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:04,272
Hey, fuck you, man!

124
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:08,009
I'm not fuckin'... shit.

125
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,713
Aw, fuck! Stay in here and
check out those tapes, man!

126
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:12,983
Fine! Jesus! Fuck!

127
00:10:12,984 --> 00:10:14,285
Jesus.

128
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:16,088
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

129
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:38,410
Hello?

130
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,871
Is there something...?

131
00:11:07,872 --> 00:11:09,408
Put 'em on,
put 'em on, put 'em on.

132
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:11,442
Come on. Okay, yeah.

133
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:13,443
Oh, perfect fit!

134
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:15,312
Gimme! Gimme one of these!

135
00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:17,213
It's perfect! In-I-I-ice!

136
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:19,717
- What?
- That shit is so quad.

137
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:21,885
You can't even fuckin' tell!

138
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:24,021
Oh, my God! Look at him?

139
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:26,123
Hey, dude, check it
out, check it out.

140
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:28,260
- You like these glasses, right?
- Yeah.

141
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:30,093
These are not just any
glasses, my friend.

142
00:11:30,094 --> 00:11:31,263
They're dork glasses.

143
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:33,331
<i>These are video glasses, bitch!</i>

144
00:11:33,332 --> 00:11:35,467
There's a camera in that shit,

145
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:37,070
there's a fuckin'
Mike in that shit.

146
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,072
Dude, look at 'em!
You can't see 'it!

147
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:41,807
It's awesome!

148
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:44,041
- Where can you get 'em?
- Internet, like...

149
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:49,847
Am I just, like, a spy now?

150
00:11:49,848 --> 00:11:53,385
Yeah, superspy, man...
super ass-and-titty spy.

151
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:55,386
Yeah, tonight, I'm tellin' you.

00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:57,222
I get it.

153
00:11:57,223 --> 00:11:59,091
I know what you want to do.

154
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,826
Yeah, you do!

155
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:02,495
Oh, come on, turn
your fucking dick on.

156
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:04,296
Turn it on, man! Let's do this!

157
00:12:04,297 --> 00:12:05,832
Come on!

158
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,133
- You're damn right!
- I'm not filming a porno.

159
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:11,103
Let's do this! Shut up!
We're doing this!

160
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:12,238
Come on, man!

161
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:14,040
How do I turn these off?

162
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,142
Controls are on the top.

163
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:17,876
Now, this is for fuckin' Clint,

164
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:19,345

Come on, let's do this!
Let's go, let's go!

166
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:30,323
So wholesome!

167
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:35,094
Power up!

168
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:37,864
Check it out. Turn
your brights on, yo.

169
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:39,265
That's what we're doin'
to this girl, right there.

170
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,532
That girl that
you see right there,

00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:40,970
we're gonna fuckin'
talk to her tonight,

172
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,870
we're fuckin' doin' this shit.

173
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:46,172
Fuckin' thigh-high!

174
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:48,007
No! If you're filming
right now, make sure...

175
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:49,543
I don't want to

176
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:53,280
Roll on that ass.
Roll on that fuckin' ass.

177
00:12:55,483 --> 00:13:01,888
<i>Like a cross between...</i>

178
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:04,992
What? Speak up! I can't...!

179
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,459
We gotta fuckin'
get out of there.

180
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,028
Okay, okay.
Where we gonna go now?

181
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,030
Get your game face on.
You got it!

182
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:11,997
I'm on! I'm on.
It's on right now.

183
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,301
You're my boy. You got it.
Let's do this.

184
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:24,077
So, you're... when you're
having your country breakfast,

185
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:26,379
how many fuckin' flapjacks
are you gonna put down?

186
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,549
I can do, like, five.

187
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,549
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

188
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:32,253
- That's a good one!
- At the same time.

189
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,923
Talking about
flapjacks with a girl.

190
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:37,092
<i>I could never do that.</i>

191
00:13:37,093 --> 00:13:40,260
How could you even film that?

192
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:43,932
You ready to shoot
Irish shit? What?

193
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:45,533
Yeah, sure! Yeah! All the time.

194
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,902
Hey. Two.

195
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:50,005
Two of your finest Irish shit.

196
00:13:50,006 --> 00:13:51,208
Hey, there's two more.

197
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:53,208
- How 'bout...?
- Top-shelf Irish shit?

198
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:54,176
Four Irish shit.

199
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:56,278
Four of their finest Irish...

200
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,614
this isn't enough.
What about your friends?

201
00:14:00,482 --> 00:14:02,617
Yeah? Yeah! Bring 'em over!

202
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:05,221
Go introduce me.

203
00:14:05,222 --> 00:14:06,355
Okay.

204
00:14:06,356 --> 00:14:08,189
- Stay!
- Okay.

205
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,525
Alex, do what she says, man.

206
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:12,227
Get your bread!

207
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:13,529
Get on it.

208
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:22,237
- What, man?
- Dude.

209
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:26,642
What?!

210
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,982
I-I have no idea
what you're saying.

211
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:35,551
Why are you all alone?

212
00:14:35,552 --> 00:14:37,292
Thanks, man.

213
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:45,266
Hey, you want to go
meet some people over there?

214
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:49,399
I like you.

215
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:54,036
Well, I like you too.

216
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:59,141
So, do you ever come here...
Before?

00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:15,930
What the fuck are you doing?

221
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,139
What's up, guys?

222
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:52,163

I need you to leave, sir.

226
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:57,502
Whatever. Get going.

Hey, lady, how you doin'?
You all right?

Dude! Cleared out quick!

237
00:16:21,495 --> 00:16:24,297
All right, so you
guys are good to go.

She's a fuckin' trip?

354
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:11,547
Hold on, guys.

355
00:23:11,548 --> 00:23:12,882
Hold on.

356
00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:15,892
Hold on, I-I've got
to get outta here.

357
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You could have got her, man.
What? Shit! Sorry, Clint!

358
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:50,755
- That girl just fuckin' bit me.
- Dude, what?

359
00:23:50,756 --> 00:23:53,157
Oh, fuck! She really
just fuckin' bit me!

360
00:23:53,158 --> 00:23:56,928
- Jesus Christ!
- Shane, she fuckin' bit him, man!

361
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:58,662
No means no, asshole!

362
00:23:58,663 --> 00:24:00,530
- No, no, just stop.
- She's not into him.

363
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:02,699
No, just stop, dude.
Just stop, man.

364
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,766
Don't touch her.

365
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:05,237
What's your fuckin' problem?

366
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:08,639
I wasn't gonna...

367
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:11,043
Get the fuck off of me! Shit!

368
00:24:12,878 --> 00:24:15,814
What the fuck? What the fuck?

369
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:17,182
What the fuck? What the fuck?

370
00:24:18,852 --> 00:24:21,687
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that?

371
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:25,156
What the fuck is that...?

372
00:24:25,157 --> 00:24:27,258
Patrick, shut up!

373
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:37,001
Open the door!

374
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:44,675
What the fuck is going on?

375
00:24:44,677 --> 00:24:46,545
What the fuck is that?
What is going on?

376
00:24:46,546 --> 00:24:47,714
What did you see out there?

377
00:24:47,715 --> 00:24:49,582
Shane is dead! I don't know!

378
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,885
Shane's dead? Shane's dead?
Shane's fucking dead?

379
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:55,990
I don't know! I don't know!

380
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,191
Fuck! Shit!

381
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:01,560
What the fuck? God damn it!

382
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:02,963
What did you see?
What did you fuckin' see?

383
00:25:03,963 --> 00:25:05,132
What did you fucking see?

384
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,298
- He's dead.
- He's dead?

385
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,767
He's dead. He's dead.

386
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:11,304
He's... what do we do?

387
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:13,873
Patrick, what do we do?

388
00:25:13,874 --> 00:25:14,708
Patrick!

389
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:17,219
What do we do, man?
What do we do?

390
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,222
Come on.

391
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:30,657
Patrick. Patrick.

392
00:25:30,658 --> 00:25:33,661
Where are you going?

393
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,062
Patrick, what are you doing?

394
00:25:35,063 --> 00:25:38,231
Oh, shit! What is it?

395
00:25:38,232 --> 00:25:41,335
What is it? Patrick!

396
00:25:41,336 --> 00:25:43,202
What do we do, man?

397
00:25:43,203 --> 00:25:45,573
Hey, where you going?

398
00:25:45,574 --> 00:25:48,241
Lisa! Lisa, wake up!

399
00:25:49,677 --> 00:25:51,677
- Hey.
- Oh, shit.

400
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,049
Patrick, wait!
Wake up! Wake up!

401
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,686
Lisa, wake the fuck up!
Come on!

402
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:01,156
Patrick, what are you doing?

403
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:03,959
Wake up!

404
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,060
Oh, shit!

405
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:15,736
Get off me!

406
00:26:15,737 --> 00:26:19,007
Get off of me! Get off of me!

407
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:23,411
Oh, God!

408
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,859
I like you.

409
00:29:21,461 --> 00:29:23,295
No like?

410
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,451
I'm sorry.

411
00:30:10,412 --> 00:30:12,313
Please! Please!

412
00:30:12,314 --> 00:30:14,248
Help! Help! Help!

413
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,483
Please let me in!

414
00:30:16,484 --> 00:30:20,055
Please! Please let me in!

415
00:30:20,056 --> 00:30:21,623
Please!

416
00:30:21,624 --> 00:30:23,158
Let me in!

417
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:29,331
Oh, God! Help me, please!
Get me out of here! Please!

418
00:31:01,097 --> 00:31:04,099
Dude... Couldn't find it.

419
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,136
Brad.

420
00:31:07,136 --> 00:31:08,304
Brad.

421
00:31:08,305 --> 00:31:10,673
The fuck...?

422
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:12,577
What the fuck?

423
00:31:21,318 --> 00:31:23,084
It's not filming.
I mean... yeah...

424
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:24,620
Then what's this
fucking red light?

425
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:26,571
I mean, it's a camera, but...

426
00:31:42,572 --> 00:31:45,709
Well, looks like we've
found all this guy's shit.

427
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,478
Yeah, there's a ton
of shit in here.

428
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:49,681
All right, you go that way.

429
00:31:49,682 --> 00:31:52,331
- I'm gonna go over here.
- All right.

430
00:32:07,332 --> 00:32:08,533
Found it!

431
00:32:08,534 --> 00:32:09,701
You got it?

432
00:32:09,702 --> 00:32:11,703
Yeah, yeah.

433
00:32:11,704 --> 00:32:13,212
All right,
let me get over there.

434
00:32:20,212 --> 00:32:22,746
Which one is it?

435
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:24,749
I don't know, man.

436
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,351
He said we'd fucking
know, but I don't,

437
00:32:27,352 --> 00:32:31,621
so... Get a bag,
and let's just take

438
00:32:31,622 --> 00:32:34,192
all this shit up to the car.

439
00:32:34,193 --> 00:32:35,658
All right, let me...
let me find something.

440
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:37,128
We're just gon' take all of it?

441
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:39,196
Yeah, take all of it.

442
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:40,475
Fuck.

443
00:32:48,475 --> 00:32:50,676
Okay, this crate.

444
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,244
This crate right here.

445
00:32:53,245 --> 00:32:55,781
Oh, shit. Okay.

446
00:32:55,782 --> 00:32:58,696
This bag is better.

447
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Okay.
Shit!

448
00:33:16,736 --> 00:33:18,271
Shit! Gary!

449
00:33:18,272 --> 00:33:20,372
- Gary! Gary!
- What?

450
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,341
There's a fuckin'
man down here!

451
00:33:22,342 --> 00:33:25,078
Shut the... dude, I'm
fuckin' dead serious.

452
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,546
Do you want me to replay this?

453
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:29,148
No.
Here. Take this fuckin' backpack.

454
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:30,649
Here's a fuckin' crate.

455
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,284
Let's just fuckin' go.

456
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:33,654
There's not a man down here.

457
00:33:33,655 --> 00:33:35,588
Man... I just saw... look.

458
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:38,657
Right. I'm telling you,
he just crawled back there.

459
00:33:38,658 --> 00:33:40,260
Hey, dude,
there's nothing there.

460
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:42,262
You're tripping.
That's what trippers do.

461
00:33:42,263 --> 00:33:43,464
I don't blame you. But, like...

462
00:33:43,465 --> 00:33:45,330
I mean, it's a good
job at that,

463
00:33:45,331 --> 00:33:48,267
but you didn't see an
old fucker or whatever.

464
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:50,837
Let's just hurry up
and get this shit and go.

465
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:34,783
Okay.

466
00:34:34,784 --> 00:34:36,417
Hi.

467
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:38,387
This is...
We're going on a road trip.

468
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:40,554
Sam and I are going
on a road trip,

469
00:34:40,555 --> 00:34:46,428
and I'm gonna be recording
our mementos, our memories.

470
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:49,498
First memory
is Sam already pulling over

471
00:34:49,499 --> 00:34:51,333
to go to the bathroom.

472
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:53,502
But this is what we're
going to be looking at

473
00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:55,804
<i>for a long time.</i>

474
00:34:55,805 --> 00:34:57,806
Nothingness.

475
00:34:57,807 --> 00:35:00,780
Cars.

476
00:35:11,754 --> 00:35:13,729
What we got there?

477
00:35:18,729 --> 00:35:20,829
I don't see it.

478
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:27,470
Looks like there's
bullet holes in the side.

479
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:30,372
Wonder if people go out there
and shoot their guns at it.

480
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:33,745
It's just, like, a fff...
Really messed-up car.

481
00:35:35,745 --> 00:35:37,651
That's crazy.

482
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:44,854
Don't forget to drive
really slow on curves.

483
00:35:44,856 --> 00:35:47,390
Okay.

484
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:53,964
What are you doing? You don't
want to get a sunburn?

485
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:56,667
No, I don't want
to get a sunburn,

486
00:35:56,668 --> 00:35:58,669
and I forgot to buy sunscreen.

487
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:18,622
It must suck to be
woken up all the time.

488
00:36:18,624 --> 00:36:22,460
Babe, are you gonna
wash your hands?

489
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,265
Promise me before we eat
you're gonna wash your hands.

490
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:28,846
<i>I'll wash my hands after
I eat with my hands.</i>

491
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:44,551
So this must be the main drag.

492
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:48,552
I can't imagine
there being much...

493
00:36:48,553 --> 00:36:51,694
singing barbecue. Singing pig.

494
00:36:55,695 --> 00:36:58,695
So, Sam got this room.

495
00:36:58,698 --> 00:37:02,368
It's kind of dirty, and
there only two beds.

496
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:04,937
I guess he didn't reserve

497
00:37:04,938 --> 00:37:06,572
with enough time
so that we could get

498
00:37:06,573 --> 00:37:09,707
a room with one bed,
which is annoying.

499
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:11,410
But I guess it's okay,

500
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:13,645
'cause then at least
he won't steal the sheets.

501
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:18,417
But I'm gonna investigate
to see how dirty it is.

502
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,498
Okay.

503
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:34,972
This is the germiest part.

504
00:37:42,776 --> 00:37:46,082
There's, like,
stains all around.

505
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:51,550
You think I could
pull off cowboy boots?

506
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:52,551
- Mnh-mnh.
- No?

507
00:37:52,554 --> 00:37:53,988
- No.
- I don't think so either.

508
00:37:54,988 --> 00:37:57,623
<i>I wish I could.</i>

509
00:37:57,624 --> 00:38:00,097
It's sort of appealing
to me, but...

510
00:38:03,097 --> 00:38:05,532
How 'bout a big ol'
wallet like that?

511
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,966
I like that. I would want that.

512
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,101
Big billfold.

513
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:09,637
Yeah, I think that'd be cool.

514
00:38:09,638 --> 00:38:11,109
Cowboy hat? Could I
wear a cowboy hat?

515
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:15,443
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

516
00:38:15,444 --> 00:38:16,644
- Definitely.
- Think so?

517
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:18,579
- Yeah.
- Should I go in and try one on?

518
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,918
Yeah.

519
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:25,720
Where are we?

520
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:28,923
We're in wild west town.
Old town, wild west.

521
00:38:28,924 --> 00:38:30,557
We're at the wild west
junction.

522
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,727
All right?

523
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,762
Come on in.

524
00:38:34,763 --> 00:38:36,098
<i>Believe it or not,</i>

525
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:38,665
<i>this old miner here
can see your future.</i>

526
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:41,038
<i>Got some money? I'll
tell you all about it!</i>

527
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:46,141
- You got some money?
- I don't.

528
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:48,109
How much does it cost
to tell your future?

529
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,479
I think it costs a dollar.

530
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,480
<i>But remember the movie big?</i>

531
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:52,814
Are you afraid of your future?

532
00:38:52,815 --> 00:38:55,155
Hold on, let me see
if I've got a dollar.

533
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,025
<i>Hey there, feller.
This here's pappy,</i>

534
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:05,961
<i>and it must be your lucky day</i>

535
00:39:05,962 --> 00:39:09,498
<i>'cause I have some words
of wisdom just for you.</i>

536
00:39:09,499 --> 00:39:10,966
<i>Listen up, now, you hear?</i>

537
00:39:10,967 --> 00:39:13,502
<i>A closed mouth gathers no foot!</i>

538
00:39:13,503 --> 00:39:15,036
<i>Yep, yep. That's right.</i>

539
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:17,806
<i>It's a whole lot better
to say just a little bit</i>

540
00:39:17,807 --> 00:39:20,609
<i>than to say too much
and wish you hadn't.</i>

541
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:22,076
<i>You know what I'm sayin'?</i>

542
00:39:22,077 --> 00:39:23,614
<i>Now, don't you be a stranger.</i>

543
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:25,615
<i>I've got lots more
to say to you.</i>

544
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:27,520
Oh, here we go.

545
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,187
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

546
00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:34,524
"A new turn of events
will soon come about.

547
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:36,559
- "A happy reunion with..."
- Hey, there, pardner!

548
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,894
- Yep, I'm talkin' to you!
- "A happy reunion..."

549
00:39:37,895 --> 00:39:40,162
<i>Pappy here's
got some wisdom for you!</i>

550
00:39:40,163 --> 00:39:41,798
"A happy reunion
with a loved one

551
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:43,899
"will make life all
that you ever wanted it

552
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,200
"or dreamed it to be.

553
00:39:45,201 --> 00:39:46,736
"You have a very
trusting nature

554
00:39:46,737 --> 00:39:48,805
"and are easily taken in
by so-called friends.

555
00:39:48,806 --> 00:39:51,774
"Do not be so anxious
to do favors unto others,

556
00:39:51,775 --> 00:39:53,210
"as there is one
who is just waiting

557
00:39:53,211 --> 00:39:56,211
to take advantage
of your good nature."

558
00:39:56,212 --> 00:39:58,213
A new turn of events
will soon come about.

559
00:39:58,215 --> 00:40:00,183
Happy reunion with a loved one.

560
00:40:00,184 --> 00:40:03,041
That's great. I'm gonna
keep that forever.

561
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:25,041
Stephanie?

562
00:40:25,044 --> 00:40:26,676
Don't put that on.

563
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:28,812
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't want you to.

564
00:40:28,813 --> 00:40:30,113
I'm about to go to sleep.

565
00:40:30,114 --> 00:40:32,748
Oh, Jesus! Oh, sorry.

566
00:40:32,749 --> 00:40:33,851
That scared me.

567
00:40:33,853 --> 00:40:37,088
Hold on,
take your sweatshirt off.

568
00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:38,523
Are you recording this?

569
00:40:38,524 --> 00:40:41,059
- Yes.
- I really don't want to.

570
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,260
Don't want to what?

571
00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:44,896
Come on, just take... hold on.

572
00:40:44,897 --> 00:40:48,599
Take your sweatshirt off.
I have a really good idea.

573
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,168
Just for one second, I promise.

574
00:40:51,169 --> 00:40:52,172
It's a super good idea.

575
00:40:54,172 --> 00:40:55,974
Okay.

576
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,711
- Please don't do this.
- What?

577
00:41:00,712 --> 00:41:02,982
I just said I didn't want you
to record something like this.

578
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:04,883
What are you asking about?

579
00:41:04,884 --> 00:41:09,820
I'm saying that... Stop!

580
00:41:09,822 --> 00:41:12,024
- Come on.
- I don't want to film this.

581
00:41:12,025 --> 00:41:14,792
Come on. Come on, make out
with me for a second.

582
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:17,160
I will make out with you
if you put the camera away.

583
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:18,797
- But I don't want to.
- Why?

584
00:41:18,798 --> 00:41:21,204
'Cause it's so good.
You look so hot, babe.

585
00:41:24,204 --> 00:41:26,205
Come on. Why are you
turning away?

586
00:41:26,206 --> 00:41:29,642
'Cause I don't...

587
00:41:29,643 --> 00:41:31,115
Don't put that back on.

588
00:41:35,115 --> 00:41:36,948
Seriously?

589
00:41:36,949 --> 00:41:39,021
I said I would do it if you
would just turn the camera off.

590
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:54,337
Well... That's boring,
with your sweatshirt on.

591
00:41:57,337 --> 00:41:59,039
Will you take your pants off?

592
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,207
No.

593
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:03,943
Come on! Gimme...
gimme something.

594
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:05,352
Give me one victory.

595
00:42:11,352 --> 00:42:14,688
You're so...
God, you're so sexy!

596
00:42:14,689 --> 00:42:16,088
Stop!

597
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:18,691
What are you doing? You
can't even enjoy this!

598
00:42:18,692 --> 00:42:20,894
You're holding a camera!

599
00:42:25,233 --> 00:42:27,734
- You're being too loud!
- I'm not being too loud.

600
00:42:27,735 --> 00:42:30,236
Yes, you are!
You disturbed the neighbors!

601
00:42:30,237 --> 00:42:32,372
<i>No, you disturbed
the neighbors.</i>

602
00:42:32,373 --> 00:42:34,975
Come on, go answer it.

603
00:42:34,976 --> 00:42:36,977
Well, I'm not going
to answer it.

604
00:42:36,978 --> 00:42:39,180
- You go answer it.
- I don't want to. I'm scared!

605
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,099
Are you...? Go answer it!

606
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:58,201
It's a girl.

607
00:43:21,124 --> 00:43:22,794
Sam?

608
00:43:24,794 --> 00:43:25,760
Sam?

609
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:27,161
What?

610
00:43:27,162 --> 00:43:30,167
Will you come out here
and tell me what happened?

611
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:35,142
Will you come out here
and tell me what happened?

612
00:43:39,143 --> 00:43:40,248
What happened just now?

613
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:51,254
Well, somebody
knocked on our door

614
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:57,060
and I answered it,
and it was a girl...

615
00:43:57,061 --> 00:43:57,996
well, I don't know.

616
00:43:58,996 --> 00:44:02,365
<i>She was like, young, but not...
not, like, a girl girl,</i>

617
00:44:02,366 --> 00:44:04,804
like, a college-age girl.

618
00:44:06,804 --> 00:44:07,373
And...

619
00:44:09,373 --> 00:44:12,475
She asked if we could
give her a ride...

620
00:44:12,477 --> 00:44:15,112
- Tomorrow.
- Where?

621
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:18,482
I don't know. It
didn't get that far.

622
00:44:18,483 --> 00:44:20,750
It was, like, really creepy.

623
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:21,952
That's so weird.

624
00:44:21,953 --> 00:44:24,353
<i>I know. It is really weird.</i>

625
00:44:24,354 --> 00:44:27,026
My only guess is that she must
be just going door to door

626
00:44:28,026 --> 00:44:30,127
and asking everybody,
but why wouldn't you,

627
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:33,297
like, wait for people to be
getting into their cars tomorrow

628
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:35,364
to ask for a ride?

629
00:44:35,365 --> 00:44:37,233
It's, like, really...

630
00:44:37,234 --> 00:44:40,404
- Maybe it's an emergency.
- It didn't seem like an emergency.

631
00:44:40,405 --> 00:44:42,038
And also, she's, like, not...

632
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:43,508
she wasn't physically
intimidating,

633
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:46,409
but I got instantly... Nervous.

634
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:50,413
There's something
really scary about her,

635
00:44:50,415 --> 00:44:51,851
even though I wasn't, like,

636
00:44:51,852 --> 00:44:53,952
afraid she was gonna hurt me,

637
00:44:53,953 --> 00:44:56,759
but she was just, like, weird.

638
00:45:07,433 --> 00:45:09,235
She's gone.

639
00:45:10,235 --> 00:45:11,401
What?

640
00:45:11,402 --> 00:45:13,238
She's gone.

641
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:14,542
She's not there anymore.

642
00:45:16,542 --> 00:45:18,977
That's good, right?

643
00:45:18,978 --> 00:45:22,254
Yeah. Do you think we should
still call the police, though?

644
00:45:28,255 --> 00:45:29,358
No.

645
00:45:34,059 --> 00:45:35,798
Why not?

646
00:45:38,798 --> 00:45:41,500
I don't know.

647
00:45:41,501 --> 00:45:45,069
I wouldn't really
know what to say...

648
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,505
- About it.
- Oh.

649
00:45:46,506 --> 00:45:49,910
And also, I just
don't feel like it.

650
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,311
Haven't you noticed
there's, like,

651
00:45:52,312 --> 00:45:55,413
way more hitchhikers here
than you've ever seen?

652
00:45:55,414 --> 00:45:56,581
Yeah.

653
00:45:56,582 --> 00:45:59,083
And also I think this is, like,

654
00:45:59,084 --> 00:46:02,922
a part of the country
that has drug problems...

655
00:46:02,924 --> 00:46:04,924
like, meth problems.

656
00:46:04,927 --> 00:46:08,427
So I feel like I would
rather just let it...

657
00:46:08,428 --> 00:46:09,930
- Go.
- Okay.

658
00:46:09,931 --> 00:46:11,598
And if she's still
there in the morning,

659
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,934
then maybe we can
think about...

660
00:46:13,935 --> 00:46:19,338
Doing something about
it, but right now...

661
00:46:19,339 --> 00:46:21,846
I'm happy to let it drop.

662
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:27,953
That's fine.

663
00:46:32,953 --> 00:46:35,555
Do you want to sleep
over here with me?

664
00:46:35,556 --> 00:46:38,358
No. That's okay. I'm fine.

665
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,361
All right.

666
00:46:41,362 --> 00:46:43,362
- Good night.
- Good night.

667
00:50:53,822 --> 00:50:56,456
I hope it doesn't rain.

668
00:50:56,457 --> 00:50:58,458
Does it look like
it's gonna rain?

669
00:50:58,459 --> 00:51:01,761
Yeah, it looks like
it's really gonna rain.

670
00:51:01,762 --> 00:51:03,631
<i>As far asyou can see,
we've covered...</i>

671
00:51:03,632 --> 00:51:06,500
<i>tents, trucks, trailers,
whatever you can think of,</i>

672
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:08,468
<i>for our fifth annual
rain dance festival.</i>

673
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:10,372
<i>Mini casinos, fortune tellers,</i>

674
00:51:10,373 --> 00:51:13,741
<i>helicopter rides,
games, games...!</i>

675
00:51:13,742 --> 00:51:16,511
Did you take money
out of my wallet?

676
00:51:16,512 --> 00:51:17,847
No.

677
00:51:18,847 --> 00:51:20,480
Yeah, you did.

678
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:23,250
No, I didn't.

679
00:51:23,251 --> 00:51:27,255
Well, you must have because
I had $100 in here...

680
00:51:27,256 --> 00:51:29,790
- When would I do that?
- And now I have zero dollars in here.

681
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:33,761
Well, I didn't, so maybe you
didn't actually have that money.

682
00:51:33,763 --> 00:51:35,396
What'd you buy?

683
00:51:35,397 --> 00:51:38,499
<i>I didn't buy anything!</i>

684
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,672
I have my own money. I don't
need to take your money.

685
00:51:43,672 --> 00:51:45,710
Are you serious?

686
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:51,412
- Did you...?
- What do you think I did?

687
00:51:51,413 --> 00:51:53,282
Well, I don't know...
I've been with you...

688
00:51:53,283 --> 00:51:55,184
- ...because the money's not here!
- ...this whole time!

689
00:51:55,185 --> 00:51:57,522
I've been with you
this whole time.

690
00:51:59,522 --> 00:52:03,791
I have no idea what you could
possibly be imagining right now.

691
00:52:05,194 --> 00:52:07,299
Well, it wouldn't be
the first time...

692
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,590
You decided to treat yourself.

693
00:52:47,973 --> 00:52:49,606
How far can you go?

694
00:52:49,607 --> 00:52:51,480
I could probably go farther,
but I'm too scared.

695
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,383
Here, I'm gonna go
a little further.

696
00:52:58,384 --> 00:52:59,969
Okay.

697
00:53:31,784 --> 00:53:33,288
Are you alive?

698
00:53:35,288 --> 00:53:36,894
Did you fall?

699
00:53:52,538 --> 00:53:54,638
It's just a lady...

700
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:57,308
Out there having a
conversation on a cellphone,

701
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,910
but it's so quiet
that I can hear her

702
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,546
even though she's
about 50 yards away.

703
00:54:00,547 --> 00:54:02,414
Oh, weird!

704
00:54:02,415 --> 00:54:04,017
I don't think I can
get back up.

705
00:54:05,017 --> 00:54:08,554
- Do you need help?
- Maybe.

706
00:54:08,555 --> 00:54:10,024
Can't quite find
anything to grab on...

707
00:54:11,024 --> 00:54:13,339
Nice work.

708
00:54:25,339 --> 00:54:27,944
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

709
00:54:30,944 --> 00:54:35,047
All right, so, babe,
I'm thinking...

710
00:54:35,049 --> 00:54:39,352
<i>That we could drive home on 40</i>

711
00:54:39,353 --> 00:54:41,587
and spend the night
in lake Havasu,

712
00:54:41,588 --> 00:54:45,859
and sort of break the trip
up so it's not so brutal...

713
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:48,361
Or...

714
00:54:48,362 --> 00:54:51,598
My new idea is we could go a
little bit out of the way

715
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,799
and spend the night in Vegas

716
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,602
and still break the trip
up, for the most part,

717
00:54:56,603 --> 00:55:01,612
but also have, like, one
more day of... Fun.

718
00:55:04,612 --> 00:55:07,747
I just really badly
wanna play craps.

719
00:55:07,748 --> 00:55:09,082
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

720
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:11,084
I had so much fun
playing craps last time,

721
00:55:11,086 --> 00:55:14,088
and I haven't done it since.

722
00:55:14,089 --> 00:55:16,493
It's, like,
the really fun game.

723
00:55:18,493 --> 00:55:22,896
Real group participation game.

724
00:55:22,897 --> 00:55:24,732
Well, whatever you want to do.

725
00:55:24,733 --> 00:55:26,500
You... you get to pick.

726
00:55:26,501 --> 00:55:29,506
All right. That is definitely
what I want to do.

727
00:55:30,506 --> 00:55:33,010
I'm feeling lucky.

728
00:55:37,912 --> 00:55:39,579
Can I turn off the light?

729
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,618
Did you erase it?

730
00:57:20,618 --> 00:57:23,292
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

731
00:57:38,771 --> 00:57:40,871
What's so special
about this tape, anyway?

732
00:57:40,872 --> 00:57:42,641
I don't know.

733
00:57:42,642 --> 00:57:44,875
Maybe it's a tape of a senator

734
00:57:44,876 --> 00:57:46,911
fucking his daughter
or something,

735
00:57:46,912 --> 00:57:49,013
and we're gonna use it
for blackmail.

736
00:57:49,014 --> 00:57:50,782
I don't know,
as long as they pay us,

737
00:57:50,783 --> 00:57:53,051
but I'll tell you this,
we're gonna make tapes...

738
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,559
- copies of the tapes.
- More money.

739
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,560
<i>Can you not put that
so close to my face?</i>

740
00:58:02,561 --> 00:58:03,895
<i>It's so annoying.</i>

741
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:06,130
Wait a minute... you go
to this lake every year?

742
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:07,933
- Yep.
- By yourself?

743
00:58:07,934 --> 00:58:09,301
Wendy: Yeah.

744
00:58:09,302 --> 00:58:11,936
But this year, I have you
guys, so it's gonna be fun.

745
00:58:11,938 --> 00:58:13,674
What do you do, just, like,

746
00:58:13,675 --> 00:58:15,675
walk around the woods
and play with yourself?

747
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:20,079
If... if that's what you do,
can I play with Samantha?

748
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,212
Get it out...!

749
00:58:21,213 --> 00:58:22,783
Guys, let's scare this guy.

750
00:58:22,784 --> 00:58:24,950
- Where?
- This guy over here.

751
00:58:24,951 --> 00:58:26,284
Are you ready?

752
00:58:26,285 --> 00:58:27,853
Wait, wait, wait,
what is he doing?

753
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,923
Shit!

754
00:58:31,924 --> 00:58:33,059
Oh, shit!

755
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,593
Ho ho ho!

756
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,933
You almost fuckin'
killed that guy!

757
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,734
He was kind of cute, though.

758
00:58:41,735 --> 00:58:43,068
- What?
- He was.

759
00:58:43,069 --> 00:58:45,104
You are... you seriously
want to fuck anything

760
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,706
that has two legs with a
third tripod in between.

761
00:58:47,707 --> 00:58:50,843
I would never fuck you
and I would never fuck you.

762
00:58:50,845 --> 00:58:53,845
- Oh.
- Take it back. Take it back.

763
00:58:53,848 --> 00:58:56,716
- I might fuck you one day.
- Yeah, what kind of guys are you into?

764
00:58:56,717 --> 00:58:59,219
I'd fuck me. Would you, Spider?

765
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:00,886
- Fuck you?
- Yeah.

766
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:02,788
Probably.

767
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,959
I don't understand.
You go to this lake every year.

768
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,895
It's just, like a tradition-type
thing, or what's the deal?

769
00:59:08,896 --> 00:59:11,397
No, it's just fun, and not
many people go up there,

770
00:59:11,398 --> 00:59:14,342
so we'll have the place
to ourselves.

771
00:59:22,342 --> 00:59:24,243
Wait, I'll get the door.

772
00:59:24,244 --> 00:59:25,677
It's good, right?

773
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:27,116
I want to see you get it.

774
00:59:27,117 --> 00:59:28,782
Can I have a piece?

775
00:59:28,783 --> 00:59:30,986
I just got a piece for you!

776
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:34,322
Because when you told me
about this trip,

777
00:59:34,323 --> 00:59:35,024
you said it was just
gonna be us girls,

778
00:59:36,024 --> 00:59:39,059
- but now we're...
- Wait a minute.

779
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,394
Wait a minute.

780
00:59:40,395 --> 00:59:42,764
I need to document this, okay?

781
00:59:42,765 --> 00:59:46,367
You told me, Wendy...
Wendy, my sweet...

782
00:59:46,368 --> 00:59:50,204
that this was just
gonna be you and me,

783
00:59:50,205 --> 00:59:53,173
and now you've told her
that it's gonna be

784
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:55,008
all girls trip.

785
00:59:56,845 --> 00:59:59,345
I'm just glad I'm with
some people and not alone.

786
01:00:00,049 --> 01:00:02,151
I don't want to hear a word
about you jerking off.

787
01:00:02,153 --> 01:00:04,419
I don't jerk off that much, but...

788
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:05,921
- Not that much?
- Come on!

789
01:00:05,922 --> 01:00:07,355
Is this it?

790
01:00:07,356 --> 01:00:09,792
I don't know. Is this it?

791
01:00:09,793 --> 01:00:11,325
Oh, okay, yeah. This is...

792
01:00:11,326 --> 01:00:15,064
Dead end! Let's take the left!

793
01:00:15,065 --> 01:00:16,235
Really, Wendy?

794
01:00:19,235 --> 01:00:20,467
To go, so fucking go, man.

795
01:00:20,468 --> 01:00:21,968
I can't catch that thing.

796
01:00:22,038 --> 01:00:23,471
Just get it.

797
01:00:23,472 --> 01:00:25,073
You have your
bowie knife, right?

798
01:00:25,074 --> 01:00:26,476
Oh! Get him, get him,
get him, get him!

799
01:00:26,477 --> 01:00:28,377
Do you got him?

800
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:31,080
- What is that?
- It's a barracuda.

801
01:00:31,081 --> 01:00:32,381
- A what?
- A barracuda.

802
01:00:32,382 --> 01:00:36,317
- That's a fish, you idiot!
- It's a barracuda... Fly.

803
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:37,720
Oh, seriously?

804
01:00:37,721 --> 01:00:39,721
I don't know.

805
01:00:39,725 --> 01:00:41,224
You wanna see me eat it?

806
01:00:41,225 --> 01:00:42,358
Yeah!

807
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:44,494
Oh, fuck.

808
01:00:44,495 --> 01:00:48,063
You're not really
gonna eat it, are you?

809
01:00:48,064 --> 01:00:50,467
Oh, my God! Oh, my go...!

810
01:00:50,468 --> 01:00:53,369
<i>I mean, I was
here to fuckin' boink her.</i>

811
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:54,503
Yeah?

812
01:00:54,504 --> 01:00:57,340
What are you...?
Wait. I have a question.

813
01:00:57,341 --> 01:00:59,442
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

814
01:01:00,977 --> 01:01:03,112
See that blonde
goddess up there?

815
01:01:03,113 --> 01:01:04,880
- No, where?
- That's what I'm here for.

816
01:01:04,881 --> 01:01:07,117
I don't see much of
a blonde goddess anywhere.

817
01:01:07,118 --> 01:01:10,987
Or... Blonde crack
whore, according to you.

818
01:01:10,988 --> 01:01:12,922
- Hey, give me the camera.
- She is a crack whore.

819
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:14,288
You're not gettin'
the camera, bro.

820
01:01:14,289 --> 01:01:15,992
- Just gimme it for one second.
- Why?

821
01:01:15,994 --> 01:01:18,129
- 'Cause I wanna do something.
- No. Go fuck yourself.

822
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:19,430
Wedgie?

823
01:01:19,431 --> 01:01:23,934
- Joey... Joey...
- Did she wedgie you?

824
01:01:23,935 --> 01:01:25,301
No.

825
01:01:25,302 --> 01:01:28,339
<i>That's more like it, dick-wise,
right above your head.</i>

826
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,874
Look. Stop-stop!

827
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:31,143
It's coming right
out of your head.

828
01:01:31,144 --> 01:01:32,910
It's about the size
of your dick,

829
01:01:32,911 --> 01:01:34,310
<i>and it's moving!</i>

830
01:01:34,311 --> 01:01:35,878
We're walking around

831
01:01:35,879 --> 01:01:37,112
the middle of
the fucking woods.

832
01:01:37,113 --> 01:01:38,480
Where the fuck are we going?

833
01:01:38,481 --> 01:01:39,851
Can you get a shot of this?

834
01:01:39,852 --> 01:01:42,486
Yeah, sure. Of what?

835
01:01:42,487 --> 01:01:45,890
What, of the wall?

836
01:01:45,891 --> 01:01:47,792
Yeah. Just humor me, okay?

837
01:01:47,793 --> 01:01:49,160
It's tripping me out.

838
01:01:49,161 --> 01:01:51,928
The last time I was here,
my friend fell over it.

839
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:56,903
All right. Well...
Hi, wall. "Hi, Joey."

840
01:01:57,903 --> 01:02:01,138
- Good?
- You're so... soon as you get back up.

841
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:02,508
Why are you carrying around grass?

842
01:02:02,509 --> 01:02:04,176
Okay! God! Jeez...!

843
01:02:04,177 --> 01:02:05,343
You mother fucker!

844
01:02:05,344 --> 01:02:07,179
I didn't do it! Wendy did it!

845
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,447
Well, I... you shoulda
ninjaed that shit!

846
01:02:11,017 --> 01:02:13,518
- Oh, fuck me!
- Did I break it? Is it okay?

847
01:02:15,921 --> 01:02:19,026
Oh, my God!

848
01:02:20,026 --> 01:02:22,393
- Yo, that is gnarly!
- Hey, Samantha! Hey, look!

849
01:02:22,394 --> 01:02:24,395
<i>Hey, you like this? Easy!</i>

850
01:02:24,396 --> 01:02:25,032
<i>That reminds me of your mom!</i>

851
01:02:26,032 --> 01:02:27,497
Oh, that's funny.
That's really funny.

852
01:02:27,499 --> 01:02:29,099
You guys are fucking disgusting.

853
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,205
Seriously, that's gross!
Stop poking it!

854
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:33,472
Oh, my God,
it's not gonna hurt you.

855
01:02:33,473 --> 01:02:35,841
- Oh, look!
- Yo, that's filled with nutrients.

856
01:02:35,842 --> 01:02:38,010
Just suck on it. Bite into it!

857
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:40,422
What are you doing
over there, crazy girl?

858
01:02:48,422 --> 01:02:49,955
What's with this camera?

859
01:02:49,956 --> 01:02:51,625
Look at that! Look, this!

860
01:02:51,626 --> 01:02:53,559
- Look at this.
- Oh, wow.

861
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,863
- Isn't that awesome?
- Yo, we could trip all day on that.

862
01:02:56,864 --> 01:02:58,396
Yeah.

863
01:02:58,397 --> 01:03:00,966
- Oh, yeah.
- You like that? Yeah?

864
01:03:00,967 --> 01:03:04,470
Dream on.

865
01:03:04,472 --> 01:03:10,377
<i>Joey... You're all gonna
fuckin' die up here.</i>

866
01:03:10,378 --> 01:03:11,883
What?

867
01:03:14,883 --> 01:03:16,216
- Tell me you got that.
- Nice!

868
01:03:16,217 --> 01:03:17,651
That one skipped,
like, 20 feet.

869
01:03:17,652 --> 01:03:19,286
Nice, dude!

870
01:03:19,287 --> 01:03:21,455
I'm not getting
in that fucking lake.

871
01:03:21,456 --> 01:03:23,898
- Yo, give me that.
- You get this?

872
01:03:29,898 --> 01:03:31,498
What's up, guys?

873
01:03:31,499 --> 01:03:33,900
What up?

874
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:35,902
What are you guys doin'?

875
01:03:35,903 --> 01:03:39,172
Just fuckin' chillin'.

876
01:03:39,173 --> 01:03:40,607
Here, babe.

877
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:42,142
Are you guys doing drugs?

878
01:03:43,144 --> 01:03:44,012
What?

879
01:03:44,013 --> 01:03:45,381
<i>He fuckin' calls it drugs!</i>

880
01:03:45,382 --> 01:03:47,014
Wait, I gotta get this.

881
01:03:47,015 --> 01:03:49,151
No, oh, my God, Spider, the
look on your face right now...

882
01:03:49,152 --> 01:03:51,352
Are you guys doing
drugs right now? Seriously.

883
01:03:51,353 --> 01:03:54,155
- No, seriously.
- Spider, can I tell you something?

884
01:03:54,156 --> 01:03:56,156
- Okay.
- You're a fucking dweeb.

885
01:03:56,157 --> 01:03:57,625
Whatever. I don't...
I don't do drugs.

886
01:03:57,626 --> 01:03:59,360
How 'bout that?
How's that sound?

887
01:03:59,361 --> 01:04:01,562
Spider, what's wrong?
Why do you look so scared?

888
01:04:01,563 --> 01:04:03,564
I'm... scared of
getting the fear.

889
01:04:03,565 --> 01:04:05,532
- What?
- What?

890
01:04:05,533 --> 01:04:07,303
The fear.
You never heard of that?

891
01:04:09,203 --> 01:04:12,106
Don't laugh, don't laugh!
I'm serious. The fear.

892
01:04:12,107 --> 01:04:13,507
You know, when you do
too many drugs

893
01:04:13,508 --> 01:04:15,678
and then you get, like,
all freaked out and crazy?

894
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:18,479
Spider, there's no fucking
such thing as the fear.

895
01:04:18,481 --> 01:04:20,082
Just take a hit, bro.

896
01:04:20,083 --> 01:04:21,052
Take a fucking
hit and chill out!

897
01:04:22,052 --> 01:04:24,319
- I'll take a hit if you don't film it.
- Promise.

898
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,456
- Okay. - Spider: Yeah?
- Wendy: Scout's honor.

899
01:04:31,461 --> 01:04:32,962
No, no, no.

900
01:04:32,963 --> 01:04:34,664
You've got to, like,
breathe it in...

901
01:04:34,665 --> 01:04:36,198
- through my nose?
- Breathe through your nose.

902
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:38,968
<i>That was huge, girls!</i>

903
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:42,136
- Oh, man!
- Oh, my God!

904
01:04:42,137 --> 01:04:44,306
Fucker's gonna die!

905
01:04:45,675 --> 01:04:47,344
Fuck this. Can't take that.

906
01:04:47,345 --> 01:04:51,212
- Careful, bro!
- I'm sorry!

907
01:04:51,213 --> 01:04:53,415
Oh, my God,
my throat's on fire.

908
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:55,985
Wendy, what the fuck
were you saying before

909
01:04:55,986 --> 01:04:58,320
about us all gettin' killed?

910
01:04:58,321 --> 01:05:00,590
<i>- Wait, what?
- When did she say that?</i>

911
01:05:00,591 --> 01:05:02,325
We were over by
the mushroom tree.

912
01:05:02,326 --> 01:05:04,427
When we were standing
over by the tree,

913
01:05:04,428 --> 01:05:07,329
she was like, "you're all
gonna fuckin' die!"

914
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:10,266
What do you mean, like, here?
Like, here-here?

915
01:05:10,267 --> 01:05:12,101
Here?

916
01:05:12,102 --> 01:05:14,336
- Did you guys not hear about this?
- ...No.

917
01:05:14,337 --> 01:05:16,107
Why the fuck would
I come to this lake

918
01:05:16,108 --> 01:05:18,708
if I heard about some
damn murders out here?

919
01:05:18,709 --> 01:05:21,677
Yeah. It was pretty bad.

920
01:05:21,678 --> 01:05:23,278
- Wait.
- Are you being serious?

921
01:05:23,279 --> 01:05:25,280
You're fuckin' with us!
Get outta here!

922
01:05:25,281 --> 01:05:26,782
No, I'm being dead serious.

923
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,418
Well, what happened?

924
01:05:32,623 --> 01:05:35,026
You know, the weird thing is

925
01:05:35,027 --> 01:05:38,361
that I don't remember
what he looked like.

926
01:05:38,362 --> 01:05:41,531
<i>What do you mean, you don't remember?</i>

927
01:05:41,532 --> 01:05:42,768
<i>What who looked like?</i>

928
01:05:42,769 --> 01:05:45,636
What are you talking about?

929
01:05:48,039 --> 01:05:50,374
- What?
- Fuck you! Fuck you! I told you guys!

930
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:52,375
- What the fuck?!
- The fear! You see!

931
01:05:52,376 --> 01:05:54,211
<i>She gave me the fuckin' fear!</i>

932
01:05:54,212 --> 01:05:55,779
- You know what?
- Fuck this! Fuck this!

933
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:58,182
- I'm going swimming.
- Seriously?

934
01:05:58,183 --> 01:06:00,151
- Yep, seriously.
- Go for it!

935
01:06:00,152 --> 01:06:02,386
Will you strip down for me, Joey?

936
01:06:02,387 --> 01:06:05,756
- I don't care.
- Oh, yeah?

937
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:07,692
Are you sure you wanna see that?

938
01:06:07,694 --> 01:06:09,293
Like I said earlier,
2-inch cock.

939
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:13,097
Probably gonna be
two inches in a minute!

940
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:20,304
Oh, fuck!

941
01:06:20,305 --> 01:06:24,305
Oh, it's fuckin' cold, man!

942
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:27,179
Oh, my God! You...!
That was crazy!

943
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:29,181
That was fuckin' beautiful.

944
01:06:29,182 --> 01:06:31,782
I'll join you in a minute.
Or not. We'll see.

945
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:37,591
Are you se...?

946
01:06:39,591 --> 01:06:41,193
What the hell? Is he...?

947
01:06:41,194 --> 01:06:43,161
- I'm fuckin' with you!
- Fuck you!

948
01:06:43,163 --> 01:06:45,698
Dude, I've got to take a shit. You
just scared the shit outta me.

949
01:06:45,699 --> 01:06:47,735
Can I come with you?

950
01:06:49,735 --> 01:06:52,805
<i>Spider, did you bring
the fucking camera?</i>

951
01:06:52,806 --> 01:06:54,607
No.

952
01:06:54,608 --> 01:06:56,274
Yeah.

953
01:06:56,275 --> 01:06:57,610
So, what was the deal
with Wendy...

954
01:06:57,611 --> 01:06:59,879
- And all that killer shit?
- I don't know.

955
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,748
That fucking story
was creeping me out.

956
01:07:01,749 --> 01:07:04,249
- She is weird.
- I know, right? That's what I'm talking about.

957
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,486
The fear, right there.

958
01:07:06,487 --> 01:07:09,455
What are you doing behind there?
It really stinks.

959
01:07:09,456 --> 01:07:12,225
Spider, you wanna
see something sickening?

960
01:07:12,226 --> 01:07:14,130
- Sure!
- It's fucking disgusting.

961
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:19,732
This is my new tryout,
Spider, just for you.

962
01:07:19,734 --> 01:07:24,404
No one has seen this yet.
This shit is red hot.

963
01:07:24,405 --> 01:07:26,373
Prepare for awesome.

964
01:07:26,374 --> 01:07:27,507
Wait, what?

965
01:07:29,376 --> 01:07:32,846
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God!

966
01:07:34,481 --> 01:07:37,416
Oh, my God, your eye!
Look at your fucking eye!

967
01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:39,386
What the fuck?

968
01:07:39,387 --> 01:07:43,657
Oh, fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

969
01:07:43,658 --> 01:07:45,858
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!

970
01:08:22,897 --> 01:08:24,899
Hey, Joey.

971
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,534
Oh, hey, what's up?

972
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,802
Oh, God, it's gettin'
fuckin' cold.

973
01:08:28,803 --> 01:08:30,571
Where are the other guys at?

974
01:08:30,572 --> 01:08:33,708
They left. Wanna fuck?

975
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:38,547
- They left?
- Did you hear what I said?

976
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:40,450
So they just left their stuff?

977
01:08:40,451 --> 01:08:42,651
Joey, please do not
tell me you're a virgin.

978
01:08:42,652 --> 01:08:44,320
What?

979
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:46,622
Come on, I think we should
get back into the lake,

980
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,389
fuck each other's brains out,

981
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,859
and we could even film it
for prosperity.

982
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,294
Turn that shit off.

983
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:56,464
<i>Don't you wanna fuck me?</i>

984
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:58,601
You were serious
earlier, weren't you?

985
01:08:58,602 --> 01:08:59,935
About the murders?

986
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:01,770
I remember reading
about it now.

987
01:09:01,771 --> 01:09:04,940
It was, like, four kids
were killed, and the guy...

988
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:07,743
they said the guy was,
like, insane.

989
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:09,745
He was beyond insane.

990
01:09:09,747 --> 01:09:12,348
He was evil.

991
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:16,353
This lake ran red
with their blood,

992
01:09:16,354 --> 01:09:18,955
and I came back... To move on.
I-I get it.

993
01:09:18,956 --> 01:09:20,490
It's some kind of, like,

994
01:09:20,491 --> 01:09:22,959
post-traumatic stress
therapy or something.

995
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,594
No, it's not therapy.

996
01:09:24,595 --> 01:09:27,630
I brought you back
because I needed bait.

997
01:09:27,631 --> 01:09:29,265
Bait?

998
01:09:29,266 --> 01:09:31,500
They never caught him, Joey.

999
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:34,871
They never believed me, how...
how he was everywhere.

1000
01:09:34,872 --> 01:09:36,041
How he could be
at two places at once.

1001
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:40,809
That wall back there... my friend
smashed her head open on it.

1002
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:44,613
Wendy, this is crazy, okay?
I think you need help.

1003
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:46,617
Maybe we should just get the others
and get the fuck outta here.

1004
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:49,920
- They're dead, Joey.
- He's back. No.

1005
01:09:49,921 --> 01:09:52,889
And this time, I'm ready for you.
Get that shit outta here.

1006
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:54,958
I think you need help.

1007
01:10:10,908 --> 01:10:13,823
Give it to me. Shit.

1008
01:10:25,824 --> 01:10:27,837
Come on!

1009
01:10:37,837 --> 01:10:39,445
Come on, fucker!

1010
01:10:49,716 --> 01:10:51,582
Why can't I film you?

1011
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,958
Fuck!

1012
01:10:59,959 --> 01:11:01,093
Oh, shit.

1013
01:11:01,094 --> 01:11:03,383
Shit, shit, shit.

1014
01:11:23,383 --> 01:11:31,383
Oh, fuck.
You came... Back... For nothing.

1015
01:11:59,653 --> 01:12:01,522
If you're watching this...

1016
01:12:01,523 --> 01:12:04,799
Don't come here!

1017
01:12:10,799 --> 01:12:12,165
Joey?

1018
01:12:22,043 --> 01:12:23,079
Joey?

1019
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,850
What are you waiting for?

1020
01:13:15,097 --> 01:13:19,120
I beat you, one on one, asshole.

1021
01:13:38,121 --> 01:13:39,792
Oh, fuck!

1022
01:14:32,577 --> 01:14:34,911
Where the fuck
did those guys go?

1023
01:14:34,912 --> 01:14:36,849
<i>Where the fuck did they go?</i>

1024
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,852
Here you go.
I've got a flashlight.

1025
01:14:40,853 --> 01:14:42,822
Probably fuckin'
each other downstairs.

1026
01:14:42,823 --> 01:14:44,956
Dude, we were just downstairs.

1027
01:14:44,957 --> 01:14:47,291
They're not downstairs.

1028
01:14:47,292 --> 01:14:49,827
Where do you think they're at?

1029
01:14:49,828 --> 01:14:51,830
I don't know.
I'll go look for 'em.

1030
01:14:51,831 --> 01:14:53,632
You look through these
fuckin' tapes, okay?

1031
01:14:53,633 --> 01:14:55,600
No, no, no. Just... look...

1032
01:14:55,601 --> 01:14:58,236
just like that, you're gonna leave
me in here with this dead fucker?

1033
01:14:58,237 --> 01:15:00,371
Sorry if your vagina
hurts there, sister,

1034
01:15:00,372 --> 01:15:01,872
but someone's gotta do it.

1035
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:04,942
Just get outta the way.
Just... fuck it.

1036
01:15:47,654 --> 01:15:49,654
<i>- Hey!
- Hi!</i>

1037
01:15:49,657 --> 01:15:51,690
How was... how was work?

1038
01:15:51,692 --> 01:15:53,894
<i>It was fine.</i>

1039
01:15:53,895 --> 01:15:56,097
<i>One of the other
girls called in sick,</i>

1040
01:15:56,098 --> 01:15:59,099
<i>so I was the only one
answering phones all night.</i>

1041
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,368
<i>Also, my... my arm's
been really bothering me.</i>

1042
01:16:02,369 --> 01:16:04,371
<i>It's like I bruised it
or something,</i>

1043
01:16:04,372 --> 01:16:06,775
<i>but I don't remember how.</i>

1044
01:16:07,775 --> 01:16:10,377
<i>I think you can see.</i>

1045
01:16:10,378 --> 01:16:12,048
<i>There's a bump there.
Can you see?</i>

1046
01:16:13,048 --> 01:16:14,150
Mnh-mnh.

1047
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:17,685
<i>Well...</i>

1048
01:16:17,686 --> 01:16:19,286
<i>I know I said
I didn't want this,</i>

1049
01:16:19,287 --> 01:16:22,088
<i>but when you're a doctor,
could you just support me,</i>

1050
01:16:22,089 --> 01:16:24,358
<i>and I'll just... Stay at home?</i>

1051
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:26,359
I guess, yeah,
if you want that.

1052
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,996
<i>That was easy.</i>

1053
01:16:28,998 --> 01:16:30,900
I mean, do you want me to
make it difficult for you?

1054
01:16:30,901 --> 01:16:32,900
Like... I don't know, Emily.

1055
01:16:32,901 --> 01:16:35,203
I guess you'll have to
convince me here.

1056
01:16:35,204 --> 01:16:37,806
<i>Really?</i>

1057
01:16:37,807 --> 01:16:40,945
I mean... maybe
a little convincing, or...

1058
01:16:42,945 --> 01:16:44,982
<i>Well, how 'bout now?</i>

1059
01:16:47,982 --> 01:16:51,085
Maybe a little more?

1060
01:16:51,086 --> 01:16:52,228
<i>How 'bout now?</i>

1061
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:04,732
<i>Well, now I can
show you my apartment.</i>

1062
01:17:04,734 --> 01:17:09,170
Yay. I mean... I'm gonna
see it soon enough.

1063
01:17:09,171 --> 01:17:13,108
<i>Well, fall break's
not soon enough.</i>

1064
01:17:13,109 --> 01:17:15,510
I know.

1065
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:17,251
<i>All right, so this...</i>

1066
01:17:21,251 --> 01:17:22,854
<i>Like, right here...</i>

1067
01:17:24,854 --> 01:17:28,124
<i>This is where
I heard the footsteps.</i>

1068
01:17:28,125 --> 01:17:29,858
Back there?

1069
01:17:29,859 --> 01:17:32,995
- Yeah.
- Right.

1070
01:17:32,996 --> 01:17:37,465
I mean, could it have been
coming from upstairs?

1071
01:17:37,466 --> 01:17:39,535
<i>No. I mean...</i>

1072
01:17:39,536 --> 01:17:42,103
<i>I know... I mean, my
neighbor always wears heels,</i>

1073
01:17:42,105 --> 01:17:44,007
<i>so I know what
that sounds like.</i>

1074
01:17:44,008 --> 01:17:47,010
<i>It was weird. It was like,
while it was happening,</i>

1075
01:17:47,011 --> 01:17:50,212
<i>it didn't seem like it was
real, but I was awake.</i>

1076
01:17:50,213 --> 01:17:51,881
And you didn't check?

1077
01:17:51,882 --> 01:17:54,216
<i>Are you kidding me? No way.</i>

1078
01:17:54,217 --> 01:17:56,019
<i>I can't believe
I was even, like,</i>

1079
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:58,788
<i>able to fall back asleep.</i>

1080
01:17:58,789 --> 01:18:00,225
<i>I mean, it sounds like
you were asleep.</i>

1081
01:18:02,225 --> 01:18:04,227
<i>Okay, well,
next time it happens,</i>

1082
01:18:04,228 --> 01:18:06,130
<i>I'll call you
and you can watch me,</i>

1083
01:18:06,131 --> 01:18:10,166
<i>and maybe I'll be brave
enough to open the door.</i>

1084
01:18:10,167 --> 01:18:12,301
'Kay.

1085
01:18:12,302 --> 01:18:13,506
<i>Okay.</i>

1086
01:18:15,506 --> 01:18:18,041
Emily?

1087
01:18:18,043 --> 01:18:20,511
- Hello? Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

1088
01:18:20,512 --> 01:18:22,246
What's? What's going on?

1089
01:18:22,247 --> 01:18:24,050
<i>There's something
at my door. Listen.</i>

1090
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,188
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

1091
01:18:30,189 --> 01:18:32,422
What was that?

1092
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:40,832
<i>Did you see that?</i>

1093
01:18:40,833 --> 01:18:42,232
Emily, what are you doing?

1094
01:18:42,233 --> 01:18:44,267
<i>I'm going to open
the door with you here.</i>

1095
01:18:44,268 --> 01:18:45,501
That's stupid. Why?

1096
01:18:45,502 --> 01:18:47,471
<i>No, no, this is
just like before.</i>

1097
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:48,840
Hey.

1098
01:19:04,223 --> 01:19:06,391
<i>See? I told you.
My apartment's haunted.</i>

1099
01:19:06,392 --> 01:19:09,093
It's not haunted. I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation.

1100
01:19:09,094 --> 01:19:12,364
<i>No, no, this feels
really familiar.</i>

1101
01:19:12,365 --> 01:19:14,365
What do you mean?

1102
01:19:14,366 --> 01:19:16,199
<i>Well, remember the first time</i>

1103
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,404
<i>that you got... you got
transferred off the base</i>

1104
01:19:18,405 --> 01:19:21,105
<i>when your father got transferred
to fort Leonard wood?</i>

1105
01:19:21,106 --> 01:19:23,208
- I was, like, 12?
- Yeah.

1106
01:19:23,209 --> 01:19:26,110
<i>Well, that was when things
got really bad for me,</i>

1107
01:19:26,111 --> 01:19:28,213
<i>and I had... you know,
I had my big accident</i>

1108
01:19:28,214 --> 01:19:30,882
<i>and I had to have surgery,
and it was the first time</i>

1109
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
<i>we were apart
since I was really little.</i>
I mean, now is the first time...
<i>We've been apart since high
school, and I just... I just...</i>

1110
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:41,166
Emily!

1111
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:54,939
<i>So, you think you saw...</i>

1112
01:19:55,075 --> 01:19:57,910
<i>Are you sure you saw,
like, a little kid?</i>

1113
01:19:57,911 --> 01:19:59,610
I mean, I-I think
I saw something,

1114
01:19:59,611 --> 01:20:01,346
but it could have
been anything, Emily.

1115
01:20:01,347 --> 01:20:03,250
Like, you know,
maybe it was, like...

1116
01:20:03,251 --> 01:20:06,585
A breeze or something like that.
Breeze.

1117
01:20:06,587 --> 01:20:10,156
<i>Man, of all the times for you
not to be recording our chat!</i>

1118
01:20:10,157 --> 01:20:12,027
I'll record it next time.

1119
01:20:12,028 --> 01:20:14,929
<i>I need to find out
if a little kid died here.</i>

1120
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:17,264
<i>I'm gonna ask my landlord.</i>

1121
01:20:17,265 --> 01:20:19,566
I-I don't know
if you should do that.

1122
01:20:19,567 --> 01:20:23,370
I-I don't... I can't imagine he'd be
thrilled to have that conversation.

1123
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:25,204
<i>Yeah, well, I think
he has to tell me.</i>

1124
01:20:25,205 --> 01:20:26,074
<i>I think it's the law
or something.</i>

1125
01:20:27,074 --> 01:20:28,074
The law?

1126
01:20:29,277 --> 01:20:31,312
Why are you messing
with your arm like that?

1127
01:20:31,313 --> 01:20:32,979
What's wrong?

1128
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:35,448
<i>It's not...
It's not getting better.</i>

1129
01:20:35,449 --> 01:20:37,183
<i>It's like this...</i>

1130
01:20:37,184 --> 01:20:39,385
<i>Like, a lump under
my skin or something.</i>

1131
01:20:39,386 --> 01:20:41,588
You shouldn't do that.
It's not good for you.

1132
01:20:41,589 --> 01:20:44,558
Just stop touching it, and
when I come and see you,

1133
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,662
<i>- I'll check that, okay?
- Okay.</i>

1134
01:20:47,663 --> 01:20:49,566
<i>You're right.</i>

1135
01:20:51,566 --> 01:20:53,969
Hey, Emily, what's going on?

1136
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,302
<i>I'm hearing the noise again.</i>

1137
01:20:55,303 --> 01:20:56,972
<i>I'm gonna go check it out.</i>

1138
01:20:56,973 --> 01:20:59,674
Okay. Do you have a weapon?

1139
01:20:59,675 --> 01:21:01,141
<i>No, should I?</i>

1140
01:21:01,142 --> 01:21:03,510
Yeah, I think that
would be a good idea.

1141
01:21:03,511 --> 01:21:05,484
<i>Okay, okay, hold on.</i>

1142
01:21:09,484 --> 01:21:10,688
<i>Okay.</i>

1143
01:21:12,688 --> 01:21:14,355
Be careful.

1144
01:21:14,356 --> 01:21:15,100
<i>Yeah.</i>

1145
01:21:25,101 --> 01:21:30,105
W-w-wait. Look... look
towards your living room.

1146
01:21:30,106 --> 01:21:32,608
<i>Well, I don't...
there's a lamp...</i>

1147
01:21:35,012 --> 01:21:37,246
Okay, well, do you
have a flashlight?

1148
01:21:37,247 --> 01:21:41,020
<i>No. Oh, I have... I'll use this.</i>

1149
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:44,619
<i>You here?</i>

1150
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:47,189
<i>James, are you there?</i>

1151
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:48,157
Yeah.

1152
01:21:50,259 --> 01:21:52,632
I didn't see anything. No.

1153
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
<i>- See anything?
- Mnh-mnh.</i>
Emily! Emily!

1154
01:22:02,306 --> 01:22:03,745
Close your door.

1155
01:22:08,745 --> 01:22:10,379
Are you okay?

1156
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:12,049
<i>I should talk to him.
I should have talked...</i>

1157
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:14,150
Are you all right?

1158
01:22:14,151 --> 01:22:16,386
<i>Hey, were you recording that?</i>

1159
01:22:16,387 --> 01:22:18,488
No. What do you mean? I just
got caught up in the moment.

1160
01:22:18,489 --> 01:22:19,756
<i>James!</i>

1161
01:22:19,757 --> 01:22:21,759
<i>Next time I call you
in the middle of the night,</i>

1162
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,427
<i>please press record!</i>

1163
01:22:23,428 --> 01:22:26,769
Okay. All right. I promise.

1164
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:35,572
<i>Will you stay up
with me tonight?</i>

1165
01:22:35,573 --> 01:22:37,678
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

1166
01:22:39,678 --> 01:22:41,416
<i>Thank you.</i>

1167
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:47,316
<i>So, I talked
to my landlord today.</i>

1168
01:22:47,317 --> 01:22:49,720
<i>He said no one's ever
died in my apartment, ever.</i>

1169
01:22:49,721 --> 01:22:52,490
That's not exactly something
he'd want to advertise, right?

1170
01:22:52,491 --> 01:22:54,790
<i>Yeah, but he said, like,
no kids ever lived here.</i>

1171
01:22:54,791 --> 01:22:56,527
<i>It's always been
student housing.</i>

1172
01:22:59,197 --> 01:23:01,199
What's that?
What are you doing?

1173
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,335
<i>Oh, well, I felt that lump
move in my arm today.</i>

1174
01:23:04,336 --> 01:23:07,370
Emily, what the fuck
is that? Don't do that!

1175
01:23:07,371 --> 01:23:08,805
<i>Thought it might be
a spider bite.</i>

1176
01:23:08,807 --> 01:23:10,409
<i>You know, how you hear about...?</i>

1177
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:12,743
That's an urban legend.
That's not real.

1178
01:23:12,744 --> 01:23:15,213
<i>It's right under there.
Look, look, I'll show you.</i>

1179
01:23:15,214 --> 01:23:16,649
Stop! Stop that!
Don't do that, okay?

1180
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:18,884
That's not good for you.
This is like your leg,

1181
01:23:18,885 --> 01:23:21,652
like seven years ago. You
still have a scar from that.

1182
01:23:21,653 --> 01:23:24,889
Emily, what the fuck
are you doing?

1183
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:26,259
<i>Well, I think if I just...</i>

1184
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:28,260
No, no, no, no, no.
Put that away.

1185
01:23:28,261 --> 01:23:30,496
Seriously, Emily, look at me.

1186
01:23:30,497 --> 01:23:33,764
Emily! Emily, look at me, okay?

1187
01:23:33,765 --> 01:23:35,568
You need to put that
away, all right?

1188
01:23:35,569 --> 01:23:39,138
Digging around in your arm is
not gonna do any more good.

1189
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:41,305
You just need to put
some alcohol on that

1190
01:23:41,306 --> 01:23:43,242
or iodine or something
like that

1191
01:23:43,243 --> 01:23:44,911
and... and... and put
a bandage on it

1192
01:23:44,912 --> 01:23:47,778
'cause otherwise it's just
gonna get infected, okay?

1193
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:50,750
You know, I'll be there in a
week and I'll look at it,

1194
01:23:50,751 --> 01:23:52,418
but for right now,
just leave it alone.

1195
01:23:52,419 --> 01:23:56,523
You're acting really
crazy, all right?

1196
01:23:56,524 --> 01:23:59,158
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

1197
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:01,394
Okay. I mean...

1198
01:24:01,395 --> 01:24:04,396
Can you go to the bathroom
and clean that off?

1199
01:24:04,397 --> 01:24:06,279
<i>Yeah, yeah. I'll be right back.</i>

1200
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:21,914
- Emily? Are you there?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1201
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:24,350
I gotta... I gotta do some
work, so what's going on?

1202
01:24:24,351 --> 01:24:26,288
<i>I know. This'll
only take a minute.</i>

1203
01:24:26,289 --> 01:24:28,588
- What's up?
- He's outside my room.

1204
01:24:28,589 --> 01:24:31,292
<i>I can hear the little
boy's footsteps.</i>

1205
01:24:31,293 --> 01:24:34,561
That's really scary, Emily,
what are you talking about?

1206
01:24:34,562 --> 01:24:38,731
Well, I just... I need to talk
to him, and I need your help.

1207
01:24:38,732 --> 01:24:42,535
- I mean, I'll help in any way that I can.
- Okay. Great, great.

1208
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:44,839
<i>So, I'm gonna close my eyes
so he doesn't scare me.</i>

1209
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:47,540
- What?
- I'm gonna close my eyes so I don't freak out...

1210
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,442
<i>And run back in here, okay?</i>

1211
01:24:49,443 --> 01:24:51,578
<i>So you're just gonna
tell me if he's there</i>

1212
01:24:51,579 --> 01:24:53,546
<i>and if he's paying attention to
me, and then I'll talk to him.</i>

1213
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:55,381
<i>I'll find out what he wants...</i>

1214
01:24:55,382 --> 01:24:57,750
<i>if he wants me to find his body, or...
whatever.</i>

1215
01:24:57,751 --> 01:25:00,220
<i>I just...
I don't want to look at him.</i>

1216
01:25:00,222 --> 01:25:01,624
<i>He's a ghost. He freaks me out.</i>

1217
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:06,627
What?! Okay. All right.

1218
01:25:06,628 --> 01:25:07,862
<i>Okay, can you do that?</i>

1219
01:25:07,863 --> 01:25:09,263
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay.

1220
01:25:09,264 --> 01:25:11,999
<i>So, as soon as... as soon
as I open the bedroom door,</i>

1221
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,937
<i>I'm gonna close my eyes, and then
you'll tell me what's there, okay?</i>

1222
01:25:15,938 --> 01:25:17,472
All right.

1223
01:25:17,473 --> 01:25:19,673
- Okay, are you ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

1224
01:25:19,674 --> 01:25:21,482
<i>All right, I'm closing my eyes.</i>

1225
01:25:26,482 --> 01:25:28,883
- Hey.
- Hey.

1226
01:25:28,884 --> 01:25:31,018
<i>What's there?</i>

1227
01:25:31,019 --> 01:25:32,887
I-I don't see anything.

1228
01:25:32,888 --> 01:25:35,522
It's just your hallway.

1229
01:25:35,524 --> 01:25:36,761
<i>'Kay.</i>

1230
01:25:38,761 --> 01:25:44,769
- Anything in here?
- No. No, it's...

1231
01:25:46,769 --> 01:25:48,373
Go in your living room.

1232
01:25:50,373 --> 01:25:52,609
<i>Okay, I'm not looking.</i>

1233
01:25:53,609 --> 01:25:55,511
Listen, I don't see
anything, okay?

1234
01:25:55,512 --> 01:25:58,447
Yeah, you should go
back to your room.

1235
01:25:58,448 --> 01:25:59,614
<i>See him?</i>

1236
01:25:59,615 --> 01:26:01,018
No, I don't see anything.

1237
01:26:01,019 --> 01:26:04,291
Maybe... he's
done for the night.

1238
01:26:07,291 --> 01:26:09,291
<i>I'm almost disappointed.</i>

1239
01:26:09,292 --> 01:26:11,794
- What are you doing?
- What?

1240
01:26:11,796 --> 01:26:13,663
- Emily!
- What?

1241
01:26:13,664 --> 01:26:15,299
Close your eyes.

1242
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,569
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

1243
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
<i>Is he here?</i>
Back to your left.
- Okay.
- Emily!

1244
01:26:28,813 --> 01:26:31,479
Emily. Emily.

1245
01:27:34,481 --> 01:27:36,715
<i>James: You're telling me
part of this thing is human?</i>

1246
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:43,489
<i>Well, how many more times are you
gonna have to do this to her?</i>

1247
01:27:44,789 --> 01:27:46,757
<i>I don't know if she
can survive that.</i>

1248
01:27:48,694 --> 01:27:50,964
<i>I mean, you're telling me.
She thinks I'm in Michigan.</i>

1249
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:52,597
<i>That's far away, okay?</i>

1250
01:27:54,067 --> 01:27:56,634
<i>And that tracking device
in her arm,</i>

1251
01:27:56,635 --> 01:27:58,107
<i>does that have
an expiration date?</i>

1252
01:28:01,108 --> 01:28:03,846
<i>Good, well, take care of it.</i>

1253
01:28:06,846 --> 01:28:09,181
<i>We're gonna have to make this
look like an accident again.</i>

1254
01:28:10,851 --> 01:28:12,184
<i>It's fine.</i>

1255
01:28:12,185 --> 01:28:14,521
<i>We have people
that can take care of it.</i>

1256
01:28:14,522 --> 01:28:16,528
<i>I'm just gonna have
to break some bones.</i>

1257
01:28:20,528 --> 01:28:22,431
<i>For fuck's sake!</i>

1258
01:28:24,431 --> 01:28:27,433
Hey, how's it going?

1259
01:28:27,434 --> 01:28:29,134
<i>Made it back okay?</i>

1260
01:28:29,135 --> 01:28:32,705
Yeah, yeah. The drive was fine.

1261
01:28:32,706 --> 01:28:34,706
Are you all right?

1262
01:28:34,707 --> 01:28:36,776
<i>Yeah.</i>

1263
01:28:36,777 --> 01:28:38,078
<i>So, your professors
aren't mad at you?</i>

1264
01:28:39,079 --> 01:28:41,816
No. I haven't
spoken to my advisor yet,

1265
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:44,050
but I'll explain it to him.

1266
01:28:44,051 --> 01:28:46,453
It'll be fine.

1267
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:49,156
How are... How are you?

1268
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:51,559
<i>Okay.</i>

1269
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:54,894
<i>I went to see Dr. aberdeen
today, like I told you.</i>

1270
01:28:54,895 --> 01:28:56,698
Yeah, she came
very highly recommended

1271
01:28:56,699 --> 01:29:00,568
from my colleagues,
so... did things go well?

1272
01:29:00,569 --> 01:29:02,903
<i>She seems really professional.</i>

1273
01:29:02,904 --> 01:29:08,576
<i>She... she diagnosed me
as schizoaffective.</i>

1274
01:29:08,577 --> 01:29:10,978
<i>It's a mild form
of schizophrenia</i>

1275
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:13,714
<i>and bipolar disorder.</i>

1276
01:29:13,716 --> 01:29:14,615
Okay.

1277
01:29:14,616 --> 01:29:16,952
<i>I mean, it explains a lot...</i>

1278
01:29:16,953 --> 01:29:18,885
<i>you know, why I thought
I'd seen ghosts,</i>

1279
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:20,587
<i>why I don't remember
running out</i>

1280
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:22,092
<i>into the middle
of the street that night.</i>

1281
01:29:23,092 --> 01:29:24,195
<i>I'm just crazy.</i>

1282
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,033
Don't say that.

1283
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:34,735
<i>Well, anyway, she's got me
on some medications...</i>

1284
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:38,606
<i>perphenazine, and I don't...</i>

1285
01:29:38,607 --> 01:29:41,208
<i>I don't remember.</i>

1286
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,744
Listen, you're gonna be okay.

1287
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:47,620
- You don't know.
- I do. You're gonna be fine.

1288
01:29:51,621 --> 01:29:54,856
<i>You deserve to be
with someone normal...</i>

1289
01:29:54,857 --> 01:29:58,226
<i>you know, someone who
doesn't have so many problems.</i>

1290
01:29:58,227 --> 01:30:02,030
<i>What if we want to have
kids someday?</i>

1291
01:30:02,031 --> 01:30:04,065
You know...

1292
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:07,003
You're the only person I've
ever wanted to be with, Emily,

1293
01:30:07,004 --> 01:30:10,138
so just... stop acting
like I have a choice

1294
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:13,775
in the matter, all right?

1295
01:30:13,776 --> 01:30:17,245
<i>I don't know what I did to
deserve to deserve someone...</i>

1296
01:30:17,246 --> 01:30:19,052
<i>You're so good to me.</i>

1297
01:30:22,052 --> 01:30:23,557
Get some rest.

1298
01:30:26,558 --> 01:30:29,062
<i>I love you.</i>

1299
01:30:31,062 --> 01:30:33,263
<i>Talk to you later.</i>

1300
01:30:33,264 --> 01:30:34,674
All right.

1301
01:30:42,674 --> 01:30:44,307
How's it going?

1302
01:30:44,308 --> 01:30:47,811
<i>Parts.</i>

1303
01:30:47,812 --> 01:30:50,347
<i>I have, like,
a sore spot or something.</i>

1304
01:30:50,348 --> 01:30:54,684
Did you... did you hurt it
on the hike today, or...?

1305
01:30:54,685 --> 01:30:56,120
<i>Maybe. Maybe I bumped it.</i>

1306
01:30:56,121 --> 01:30:59,956
<i>I don't know.
I keep fiddling with it.</i>

1307
01:30:59,957 --> 01:31:01,058
Well, don't do that.

1308
01:31:01,059 --> 01:31:04,761
I'll look at it
when I get there.

1309
01:31:04,763 --> 01:31:05,266
<i>Okay.</i>

1310
01:31:08,266 --> 01:31:11,169
What are you doing?

1311
01:31:11,170 --> 01:31:13,371
<i>Changing into my jammies.</i>

1312
01:31:13,372 --> 01:31:15,372
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

1313
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:18,276
You can keep going.

1314
01:31:18,277 --> 01:31:19,911
<i>I miss you.</i>

1315
01:31:19,912 --> 01:31:22,613
<i>There was a lot of couples
on the hike today,</i>

1316
01:31:22,614 --> 01:31:25,148
<i>and I just felt
alone, you know?</i>

1317
01:31:25,149 --> 01:31:28,385
Alone? Yeah?

1318
01:31:28,386 --> 01:31:29,920
<i>How's that?</i>

1319
01:31:29,921 --> 01:31:31,094
Sit back a little bit.

1320
01:31:35,094 --> 01:31:37,996
There. Yeah.

1321
01:31:37,997 --> 01:31:39,997
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

1322
01:31:43,002 --> 01:31:44,136
<i>What were you saying?</i>

1323
01:31:44,137 --> 01:31:45,409
Nothing.

1324
01:31:52,278 --> 01:31:56,015
Zac? Hey, Zac.

1325
01:31:56,016 --> 01:31:57,319
I can't find any...

1326
01:32:00,319 --> 01:32:01,140
what the fuck...?

1327
01:32:21,307 --> 01:32:23,776
Fuck.

1328
01:32:23,777 --> 01:32:26,145
Zac!

1329
01:32:26,146 --> 01:32:27,817
Jesus.

1330
01:32:30,817 --> 01:32:32,054
Zac.

1331
01:32:34,054 --> 01:32:36,057
Zac.

1332
01:32:37,057 --> 01:32:38,927
You fuckers.

1333
01:32:39,927 --> 01:32:41,364
Zac?

1334
01:32:43,364 --> 01:32:46,166
Hello?

1335
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh... Fuck!
Jesus!
Oh, fuck!

1336
01:33:10,392 --> 01:33:11,495
Fuck!

1337
01:33:35,417 --> 01:33:36,858
Hey, Matt!

1338
01:33:41,858 --> 01:33:43,324
We not... we forgot. We forgot.

1339
01:33:43,325 --> 01:33:44,959
Did you guys bring
any tools, or...?

1340
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,795
Spatulas.

1341
01:33:45,796 --> 01:33:47,995
That's what I was using.
I was using...

1342
01:33:47,996 --> 01:33:50,264
Oh, the styrofoam plate?
On the grill!

1343
01:33:50,265 --> 01:33:51,899
That's good. That
doesn't really send

1344
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:53,269
any kind of chemicals
into our food.

1345
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:55,870
That's how men cook.
It's problem-solving.

1346
01:33:55,871 --> 01:33:57,338
<i>You're truly a man.</i>

1347
01:33:57,339 --> 01:33:58,075
You want the burnt one
or the burnt one?

1348
01:33:59,075 --> 01:34:01,242
Woman: She wants
the really long one.

1349
01:34:01,243 --> 01:34:03,445
<i>The really, really long one.</i>

1350
01:34:03,446 --> 01:34:05,562
This long.
Here we go. Here we go.

1351
01:34:19,563 --> 01:34:22,435
Hey, dude, your dumb friends are here.

1352
01:34:26,435 --> 01:34:28,105
You know all this stuff's
coming down at midnight, right?

1353
01:34:32,475 --> 01:34:34,475
Yo!

1354
01:34:34,478 --> 01:34:37,446
I'll be right down.

1355
01:34:37,447 --> 01:34:40,248
Come out, dude, it's gonna
be an awesome party.

1356
01:34:40,249 --> 01:34:41,850
Or not.

1357
01:34:41,851 --> 01:34:43,556
Dude, come on, aren't you
a bit old for this shit?

1358
01:34:46,557 --> 01:34:48,204
Happy Halloween!

1359
01:35:00,204 --> 01:35:01,211
Yo!

1360
01:35:06,211 --> 01:35:07,978
Yeah!

1361
01:35:07,979 --> 01:35:10,082
What's up, guys?
How's it going?

1362
01:35:11,082 --> 01:35:13,516
Awesome. That is awesome.

1363
01:35:13,517 --> 01:35:14,985
What the hell?

1364
01:35:14,986 --> 01:35:16,985
- Are you a bear?
- I'm a nanny-cam.

1365
01:35:16,988 --> 01:35:19,622
- A nanny-cam!
- Better than the Unabomber.

1366
01:35:19,624 --> 01:35:22,060
Let's go and do this.

1367
01:35:22,061 --> 01:35:23,529
Paul, you know
where we're going, right?

1368
01:35:33,339 --> 01:35:35,539
No, yeah, you're gonna
wanna go to...

1369
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:37,441
no, you wanna go 134 west.

1370
01:35:37,442 --> 01:35:39,177
You wanna stay on the 134.

1371
01:35:39,178 --> 01:35:41,346
- Fuck!
- Sorry, bro!

1372
01:35:42,982 --> 01:35:44,481
Fuck!

1373
01:35:44,482 --> 01:35:45,916
Way to give yourself an option

1374
01:35:45,917 --> 01:35:47,050
by being in the far-right Lane.

1375
01:35:47,051 --> 01:35:48,518
I thought we were going...

1376
01:35:48,519 --> 01:35:50,089
<i>I'm just gonna give
myself the option of maybe...</i>

1377
01:35:52,157 --> 01:35:55,360
It eventually will,
I think, hit spring street.

1378
01:35:55,362 --> 01:35:56,962
You say it was too dark,

1379
01:35:56,963 --> 01:35:59,063
and then you just took
off your sunglasses?

1380
01:36:02,568 --> 01:36:04,535
You're fine.

1381
01:36:04,536 --> 01:36:07,339
How many people are supposed
to be at this party?

1382
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:08,673
Do you know?

1383
01:36:12,144 --> 01:36:14,679
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1384
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,415
Are the girls
coming out tonight?

1385
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:18,684
Yeah, they'll be there.
They're coming out later.

1386
01:36:26,492 --> 01:36:28,126
Was it? Montecito?

1387
01:36:28,127 --> 01:36:30,129
Yes.

1388
01:36:30,130 --> 01:36:32,031
That's... it starts... it's here.

1389
01:36:32,033 --> 01:36:33,432
I thought you said
it was mariposa.

1390
01:36:33,433 --> 01:36:35,000
- Just pick one!
- Mariposa or Montecito?

1391
01:36:35,001 --> 01:36:36,170
It's one of those.

1392
01:36:36,171 --> 01:36:37,469
- Mar vista?
- Yep.

1393
01:36:37,470 --> 01:36:39,139
All right, I'm going left.

1394
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:41,474
"M"... Madison? This
doesn't make any sense!

1395
01:36:41,475 --> 01:36:42,775
It's fine, don't worry.

1396
01:36:43,109 --> 01:36:46,345
- Yeah, it is right.
- Oh, fuck. Is that right on the corner?

1397
01:36:47,615 --> 01:36:50,149
- Can you park here?
- Yeah, it's all right.

1398
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:51,985
I think it's fine.
Maybe we can come out

1399
01:36:51,986 --> 01:36:53,620
and check on the car later too.

1400
01:36:53,621 --> 01:36:55,054
Yeah. Fine.

1401
01:36:55,055 --> 01:36:57,023
- Can you grab this beer?
- Yeah, I got it. Here.

1402
01:36:57,024 --> 01:36:58,724
Sword? No sword? Sword!

1403
01:36:58,725 --> 01:37:00,594
Absolutely sword.
It's an awesome sword.

1404
01:37:00,595 --> 01:37:02,466
I'm wearing a stupid helmet.

1405
01:37:15,409 --> 01:37:17,644
Here, gimme a beer.

1406
01:37:17,645 --> 01:37:19,447
Thank you.

1407
01:37:19,448 --> 01:37:20,681
I wanna hold 'em.

1408
01:37:20,682 --> 01:37:23,184
- Can I get one, les?
- Yeah, sure.

1409
01:37:23,185 --> 01:37:25,224
I'm holding the...
here, hold on.

1410
01:37:29,224 --> 01:37:30,760
Jesus.

1411
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,096
What the hell, dude?

1412
01:37:34,096 --> 01:37:35,395
Suck me.

1413
01:37:40,668 --> 01:37:42,105
Awesome.

1414
01:37:44,105 --> 01:37:45,105
- Hello!
- You might try to just walk in.

1415
01:37:46,109 --> 01:37:48,577
Might want you
to ring the doorbell.

1416
01:37:52,749 --> 01:37:54,416
Where is everyone?

1417
01:37:54,417 --> 01:37:58,787
This is a nice place.
Maybe it's like a... go around back.

1418
01:37:58,788 --> 01:38:02,324
Don't worry, guys, I'll...
are you guys...?

1419
01:38:02,325 --> 01:38:04,059
Shortcut!

1420
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:05,761
Is anyone else's beer warm?

1421
01:38:05,762 --> 01:38:08,062
That actually hurt!
I'll break it!

1422
01:38:08,063 --> 01:38:10,332
Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut!

1423
01:38:10,333 --> 01:38:13,068
Where'd it go?

1424
01:38:13,069 --> 01:38:14,405
It's mine.

1425
01:38:27,518 --> 01:38:29,151
You sure this is it?

1426
01:38:29,152 --> 01:38:32,254
Yep. All the lights are on.

1427
01:38:32,255 --> 01:38:34,824
Maybe we're a little early.

1428
01:38:34,825 --> 01:38:37,259
Yeah, go that way.

1429
01:38:39,263 --> 01:38:40,433
Justin!

1430
01:38:42,433 --> 01:38:43,436
Yo, Justin!

1431
01:38:45,436 --> 01:38:46,436
Creepy!

1432
01:38:46,437 --> 01:38:48,437
This party fuckin' sucks!

1433
01:38:48,438 --> 01:38:50,177
See? It's a haunted house.

1434
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:54,709
It's an empty house.

1435
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:56,678
A really shitty haunted house.

1436
01:38:56,679 --> 01:38:58,548
So shitty!

1437
01:38:58,550 --> 01:39:01,151
- Justin?
- Justin!

1438
01:39:01,152 --> 01:39:02,853
He probably went to get beer.

1439
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:06,290
First one's through.

1440
01:39:06,291 --> 01:39:08,125
- What is it?
- All right.

1441
01:39:08,126 --> 01:39:09,764
God, look at that shit.

1442
01:39:12,764 --> 01:39:16,500
All right.

1443
01:39:16,501 --> 01:39:20,370
Okay. All right, maybe not the
scariest thing I've ever seen.

1444
01:39:22,607 --> 01:39:25,409
There's a chair. Obviously,
there was a struggle.

1445
01:39:25,410 --> 01:39:27,478
A chair! There was a struggle!

1446
01:39:27,479 --> 01:39:31,247
Oh, fuck! Holy shit!

1447
01:39:36,322 --> 01:39:38,792
Oh! Another room
that's locked up.

1448
01:39:39,792 --> 01:39:41,859
Tenant's out. Yeah.

1449
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:43,528
This is pretty cool.

1450
01:39:43,529 --> 01:39:46,797
It's, like,
a nautical theme in here.

1451
01:39:46,798 --> 01:39:52,769
Heavy clouds too...

1452
01:39:54,773 --> 01:39:55,907
Hello?

1453
01:39:55,908 --> 01:39:58,443
Oh, Jesus!

1454
01:39:58,444 --> 01:40:01,246
What? What, what, what?

1455
01:40:01,247 --> 01:40:02,913
It was like people

1456
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:04,916
reaching out of
the wall at you.

1457
01:40:04,917 --> 01:40:06,917
<i>What happened? What happened?</i>

1458
01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:08,886
I've never seen that before.

1459
01:40:08,887 --> 01:40:10,488
That was fuckin' awesome!

1460
01:40:10,490 --> 01:40:12,257
This is rad!

1461
01:40:12,258 --> 01:40:14,560
This is not that bad!

1462
01:40:14,561 --> 01:40:16,729
You hear that?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1463
01:40:18,931 --> 01:40:21,800
Go! Go!

1464
01:40:37,583 --> 01:40:40,386
Last year's party, rented
this castle in the desert.

1465
01:40:40,387 --> 01:40:41,220
Nuts!

1466
01:40:41,221 --> 01:40:43,454
It was like this
weird, medieval...

1467
01:40:43,455 --> 01:40:46,967
I don't know. I got
a sword out of it.

1468
01:41:23,464 --> 01:41:24,900
Hello?

1469
01:41:25,901 --> 01:41:27,710
Hello?

1470
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:37,914
Guys?

1471
01:41:38,914 --> 01:41:40,352
Guys.

1472
01:41:44,819 --> 01:41:46,925
Guys, not funny!

1473
01:41:50,925 --> 01:41:52,392
Fuck, dude.

1474
01:41:52,393 --> 01:41:54,394
Where's the fuckin' party, man?

1475
01:41:54,395 --> 01:41:57,468
I don't know. We're
gonna go scare Matt.

1476
01:41:59,468 --> 01:42:02,037
This place is fuckin' awesome!

1477
01:42:09,412 --> 01:42:10,949
Ready?

1478
01:42:13,949 --> 01:42:16,052
On two.

1479
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:23,925
Don't! Don't!

1480
01:42:27,064 --> 01:42:28,397
All right, I'm sorry.

1481
01:42:28,398 --> 01:42:29,564
I'm sorry, dude. Come on.

1482
01:42:29,565 --> 01:42:32,533
No, dude, that fuckin' hurt!

1483
01:42:32,534 --> 01:42:34,538
Come on, dude.

1484
01:42:38,542 --> 01:42:40,809
I can't believe
they can afford this!

1485
01:42:45,615 --> 01:42:48,684
I just don't want
anything to jump out at me.

1486
01:42:48,685 --> 01:42:49,985
I'm tired of it.

1487
01:42:49,986 --> 01:42:52,354
If you think about what
we're doing right now,

1488
01:42:52,355 --> 01:42:53,824
we're walking through a house.

1489
01:42:53,825 --> 01:42:56,326
- It's okay.
- What the fuck is that noise?

1490
01:43:00,631 --> 01:43:02,631
How do we get upstairs?

1491
01:43:02,632 --> 01:43:03,633
Probably...

1492
01:43:03,634 --> 01:43:07,737
Yeah, where the fuck is the party?

1493
01:43:13,445 --> 01:43:15,745
Hey. Anything in there?

1494
01:43:18,549 --> 01:43:20,551
I think I found the party.

1495
01:43:24,455 --> 01:43:26,490
<i>And then, through the unity</i>

1496
01:43:26,491 --> 01:43:28,458
<i>of the men with the sword.</i>

1497
01:43:28,459 --> 01:43:30,096
<i>Arise, O lord!</i>

1498
01:43:31,096 --> 01:43:32,563
<i>Do as ye have said,</i>

1499
01:43:32,564 --> 01:43:34,664
<i>and fall upon him and burn him,</i>

1500
01:43:34,665 --> 01:43:36,567
<i>that thou mayest take away</i>

1501
01:43:36,568 --> 01:43:38,569
<i>the innocent blood
which Joab shed,</i>

1502
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:40,937
from me, and from
the house of my father.

1503
01:43:40,938 --> 01:43:44,041
Arise, O lord! Cast you down!

1504
01:43:44,042 --> 01:43:46,944
Arise, O lord! Cast you down!

1505
01:43:46,945 --> 01:43:48,678
A sword is upon the liars!

1506
01:43:48,679 --> 01:43:50,580
A sword is upon the mighty men,

1507
01:43:50,582 --> 01:43:52,484
and they shall be dismayed.

1508
01:43:52,485 --> 01:43:55,085
A sword is upon their horses,
and upon their chariots,

1509
01:43:55,086 --> 01:43:56,820
and upon all the mingled people

1510
01:43:56,821 --> 01:43:59,958
that are in the midst
of her. Arise O lord!

1511
01:43:59,959 --> 01:44:01,625
Cast you down! Arise, O lord!

1512
01:44:01,626 --> 01:44:04,061
Cast him down!

1513
01:44:04,062 --> 01:44:08,700
Cast him down! Cast him down!

1514
01:44:08,701 --> 01:44:11,169
Who are you?
Who are thou foulings?

1515
01:44:11,170 --> 01:44:13,704
- Cast... you...!
- What are you doing here?

1516
01:44:13,705 --> 01:44:15,706
We're just here for the party.

1517
01:44:15,707 --> 01:44:17,174
- What are you doing here?
- Sorry.

1518
01:44:17,175 --> 01:44:19,811
You shouldn't be here!

1519
01:44:19,812 --> 01:44:21,812
- Leave!
- Run!

1520
01:44:21,813 --> 01:44:23,181
Please help me!

1521
01:44:23,182 --> 01:44:25,182
Quiet, you, quiet!
Get away from me!

1522
01:44:25,183 --> 01:44:27,185
Hey!

1523
01:44:27,187 --> 01:44:31,187
Understand me?!

1524
01:44:31,190 --> 01:44:33,197
Holy shit!

1525
01:44:37,197 --> 01:44:40,536
Oh, shit!
What the fuck is that?

1526
01:44:42,536 --> 01:44:44,670
- What the fuck is that?
- Leave!

1527
01:44:44,671 --> 01:44:47,671
Oh, fuck!

1528
01:44:47,674 --> 01:44:50,809
Oh, shit!

1529
01:44:54,547 --> 01:44:57,549
Oh, fuck! Get outta here!

1530
01:44:57,550 --> 01:45:00,023
Chad! Oh, fuck!

1531
01:45:03,024 --> 01:45:06,025
Oh, shit! Fuck!

1532
01:45:06,026 --> 01:45:07,661
Wait!

1533
01:45:07,662 --> 01:45:09,930
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1534
01:45:09,931 --> 01:45:10,731
Listen!

1535
01:45:17,771 --> 01:45:21,907
- We can't leave.
- No, wait. What?

1536
01:45:21,908 --> 01:45:24,510
Go, go.

1537
01:45:24,511 --> 01:45:26,145
What are we gonna do?

1538
01:45:28,149 --> 01:45:30,216
Just get the girl and leave.

1539
01:45:36,957 --> 01:45:40,861
Oh, God! Help!

1540
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:47,133
Okay.

1541
01:45:49,271 --> 01:45:51,605
Back up, back up, back up!

1542
01:45:56,177 --> 01:45:58,179
Go, Chad!

1543
01:45:58,180 --> 01:45:59,547
Oh, shit!

1544
01:46:03,985 --> 01:46:06,052
Get the fuck off of me!

1545
01:46:07,990 --> 01:46:09,657
Get off me!

1546
01:46:22,038 --> 01:46:25,307
Okay, I got her,
I got her, I got her.

1547
01:46:25,308 --> 01:46:27,308
Go. Go, go, go.

1548
01:46:27,309 --> 01:46:30,012
Come on! Shit!

1549
01:46:30,013 --> 01:46:31,178
Oh, fuck!

1550
01:46:35,785 --> 01:46:36,855
Go!

1551
01:46:38,855 --> 01:46:40,124
Go! Fuck! Oh, Jesus!

1552
01:46:41,124 --> 01:46:42,227
Go!

1553
01:46:44,227 --> 01:46:46,798
Fuck!

1554
01:46:48,798 --> 01:46:49,798
Get the door!

1555
01:46:49,799 --> 01:46:52,237
Oh, shit! What the fuck?

1556
01:46:55,238 --> 01:46:57,139
It's fucking burning!

1557
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:58,243
Guys, come on!

1558
01:47:01,578 --> 01:47:03,782
Oh, shit! Fuck!

1559
01:47:05,782 --> 01:47:09,352
We're trapped!
We're fuckin' trapped!

1560
01:47:09,353 --> 01:47:11,825
Over here! Over here! Go, go!

1561
01:47:14,825 --> 01:47:22,165
Watch it. Slow. Now.

1562
01:47:26,170 --> 01:47:27,803
Guys, this way!

1563
01:47:27,804 --> 01:47:30,873
Watch out for your head, dude.

1564
01:47:30,875 --> 01:47:34,978
This way!

1565
01:47:34,979 --> 01:47:36,847
Come on!

1566
01:47:36,848 --> 01:47:39,049
Go, go!

1567
01:47:42,386 --> 01:47:45,755
Go!

1568
01:47:45,756 --> 01:47:46,860
Go!

1569
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:52,001
Almost got it!

1570
01:47:56,001 --> 01:47:57,206
You go first. You go first.

1571
01:48:01,206 --> 01:48:02,673
Holy shit!

1572
01:48:05,410 --> 01:48:07,746
Go! Go! Go, go, go!

1573
01:48:07,747 --> 01:48:09,278
One more step. One more step.

1574
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:10,419
Help. Pull. Help.

1575
01:48:14,419 --> 01:48:16,688
Get the car! Get the car!

1576
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:20,426
What... what's over there?

1577
01:48:20,427 --> 01:48:23,228
Don't... Don't leave me!

1578
01:48:44,450 --> 01:48:46,151
Here. Okay. Get in.

1579
01:48:46,152 --> 01:48:47,453
Hold on, hold on.

1580
01:48:47,454 --> 01:48:49,821
Okay, okay. Her feet, her feet.

1581
01:48:49,822 --> 01:48:51,724
Hold her, hold her, hold her.

1582
01:48:51,725 --> 01:48:54,325
I got her. I got her.

1583
01:48:54,326 --> 01:48:55,461
Jesus!

1584
01:48:55,462 --> 01:48:57,262
Here. You got her?

1585
01:48:57,263 --> 01:49:01,801
Yeah.

1586
01:49:01,802 --> 01:49:04,169
Go, Chad, go!

1587
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:06,337
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

1588
01:49:06,338 --> 01:49:07,873
Hey, can you hear me?

1589
01:49:07,874 --> 01:49:10,976
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

1590
01:49:10,977 --> 01:49:13,479
What street are we on?

1591
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:16,214
Just focus and find
the fucking hospital!

1592
01:49:16,215 --> 01:49:18,818
<i>I don't even know where
the fuck we are!</i>

1593
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:20,853
What the fuck was that
back there, dude?

1594
01:49:20,854 --> 01:49:22,823
Just keep her awake!
Keep her awake!

1595
01:49:22,824 --> 01:49:25,057
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1596
01:49:25,058 --> 01:49:27,828
Fuck!

1597
01:49:27,829 --> 01:49:31,397
Deep breaths.

1598
01:49:31,398 --> 01:49:33,834
Hey, would you guys
calm the fuck down?!

1599
01:49:33,835 --> 01:49:36,236
Just breathe.

1600
01:49:36,237 --> 01:49:37,937
What the fuck, dude?

1601
01:49:37,938 --> 01:49:41,374
Dude, you gotta hurry!
What the fuck is wrong with the car?

1602
01:49:41,375 --> 01:49:44,311
Why are you stopping?
What the hell is wrong with the car?

1603
01:49:44,312 --> 01:49:45,846
<i>Dude, drive!</i>

1604
01:49:45,847 --> 01:49:47,414
<i>Fuckin' stalled, man!</i>

1605
01:49:47,415 --> 01:49:48,849
<i>Fuckin' drive, dude! Come on!</i>

1606
01:49:48,850 --> 01:49:51,351
Oh, shit! Shit!

1607
01:49:53,854 --> 01:49:55,922
What the fuck?!
Where'd she go?!

1608
01:49:55,924 --> 01:49:59,427
What the fuck?!

1609
01:49:59,428 --> 01:50:00,795
<i>Holy shit!</i>

1610
01:50:02,898 --> 01:50:04,800
<i>What the fuck? Where'd she go?</i>

1611
01:50:04,801 --> 01:50:07,067
<i>Where the fuck did she go?</i>

1612
01:50:07,068 --> 01:50:08,402
What the fuck?

1613
01:50:08,403 --> 01:50:10,138
The fuck was that?

1614
01:50:10,139 --> 01:50:13,510
What the fuck, man?

1615
01:50:14,510 --> 01:50:16,410
Oh, Jesus!

1616
01:50:16,411 --> 01:50:19,080
Fuck me!
The fuck does she want?

1617
01:50:27,256 --> 01:50:30,457
Unlock the doors, Chad.

1618
01:50:30,458 --> 01:50:31,827
<i>At least open my door.</i>

1619
01:50:34,163 --> 01:50:36,564
What the fuck, man?
Unlock the doors!

1620
01:50:36,565 --> 01:50:38,867
Fuck! Chad!

1621
01:51:12,468 --> 01:51:15,872
Go! Go! Go!

1622
01:52:02,286 --> 01:52:04,273
Oh, shit! Run, run, run!
Go, go, go!
