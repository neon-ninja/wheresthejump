1
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:32,252
What are you doing?

3
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:35,657
Stop.

4
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:39,292
You are...

5
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,228
hurting us.

6
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,230
Burn in hell.

7
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,852
No...

8
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,272
What are you doing Yosille?

9
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,443
You know what happens when I
don't feed.

10
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:31,979
This isn't real.

11
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,729
Don't you want to
see your wife again?

12
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,429
No more.

13
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,033
I will never feed you again.

14
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,601
Very well.

15
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,337
Stay in your circle, Yosille.

16
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,775
There are always others.

17
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:01,843
Wait.

18
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,780
You promise?

19
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,718
A life...

20
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:13,955
for your wife.

21
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:26,501
I'm coming Aida.

22
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,905
Forgive me God.

23
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,018
Hey...

24
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:53,888
Means a lot that you came.

25
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,525
Claire, you can say it.

26
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,895
What?

27
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,930
"Art may love you, but <i>you</i>,

28
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:05,398
you will <i>never</i> be family."

29
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,901
He said that.

30
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,636
Yeah he said a lot of crazy
shit.

31
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,906
This time will be different.

32
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,708
He's loosened the <i>Yarmulke</i>.

33
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,810
Trust me, he's changed.

34
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:16,878
I hope so.

35
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,714
Just don't forget,

36
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,782
you're carrying his only
grandkid.

37
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:23,684
It'd be a bad idea to
piss you off.

38
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,653
Hmm, that's right.

39
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,922
Just give the old man a chance.

40
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:30,057
I'm here, aren't I?

41
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:31,826
Yes you are.

42
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,630
Alright.

43
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,615
Welcome home, Art.

44
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,248
All the holy
books and scriptures

45
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:20,085
does not always prepares us

46
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,472
for tragedies such as this.

47
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:24,859
Chazal teaches us,

48
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:27,419
that in the beginning God spoke.

49
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:30,117
And with these holy letters

50
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:33,646
created the Universe.

51
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,275
From the blade of grass
to the burning stars

52
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,971
that shine above us,

53
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:40,877
all made of his holy letters

54
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:43,678
spoken at the beginning of time.

55
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:47,241
A man of heavenly perspective

56
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:50,978
restores the letters of
creation.

57
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,195
But in times of tragedy

58
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:55,959
who can say that...

59
00:07:57,273 --> 00:07:59,315
How did you grow up like this?

60
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:00,767
It was a laugh a minute.

61
00:08:02,671 --> 00:08:04,261
Ah, I'm so sorry

62
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:05,922
I didn't mean to um...

63
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:08,863
Great start.

64
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:10,108
Yeah, very good.

65
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:11,976
Don't take it to heart.

66
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:15,781
Death can bring out
the worst in people.

67
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:21,282
Welcome home, son.

68
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:22,493
It's good to see you dad.

69
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:28,547
God, did I miss you.

70
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:38,786
And you... the famous
Claire. Britain's finest.

71
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,941
It's fine.

72
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:45,013
Oh!

73
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,369
We're family, right?

74
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:52,555
So, um...

75
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:55,600
Come and see your room.

76
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:04,628
Mmm! Oh my God.

77
00:09:04,663 --> 00:09:05,839
Good, no?

78
00:09:05,873 --> 00:09:07,638
Good? This is delicious!

79
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,367
Did you make this?

80
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:10,924
I've never had a
dumpling that's...

81
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,481
No, no, no not dumpling.

82
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:14,833
<i>- Kreplach.</i>
<i>- </i> Ah, kreplach.

83
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:15,940
That's very good!

84
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:18,223
So, um, tell me.

85
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,538
Boy? Girl?

86
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:23,655
Ah, it's a girl.

87
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,281
Ah!

88
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,637
Perhaps she can learn to
write like her mother.

89
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:29,916
You read my articles?

90
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:31,577
I did a little digging.

91
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:33,999
Oh, it's just light
editorial work.

92
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,728
She's being modest.

93
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:37,388
Claire's a great writer.

94
00:09:37,424 --> 00:09:39,741
On her way to writing a
cookbook for the ages.

95
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:42,577
And she likes my <i>kreplach</i>?

96
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:44,204
Y'know

97
00:09:44,238 --> 00:09:47,179
Food connects the body to
the soul so they say.

98
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:49,254
That's lovely.

99
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,327
Hmm?

100
00:09:51,642 --> 00:09:53,441
Uh hmm.

101
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:54,547
I'm just gonna uh...

102
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:55,724
Excuse me.

103
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,306
I should've gone to your
wedding.

104
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:09,941
When you see the world a
certain way,

105
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:13,644
it's not easy to accept change.

106
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:17,795
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:19,697
- It's alright.
- No.

108
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:21,911
No, it's not.

109
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,409
Well,

110
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:28,831
We're here now.

111
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:30,767
Yeah.

112
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:36,233
Did you show them the contract?

113
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,966
What contract?
Until your Dad signs

114
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,114
<i>his house cannot be used as
collateral.</i>

115
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,709
Just, uh... tell them his
lawyer's looking over

116
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:47,303
the finer details as we speak.
We're closing soon.

117
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:48,964
Soon is not gonna cut it.

118
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:51,350
<i>I know Claire's invitro
nearly wiped you out</i>

119
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:53,461
<i>but the bank doesn't give a
shit.</i>

120
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:54,914
How long have I got?

121
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:56,782
Without your dad's
house on the line,

122
00:10:56,816 --> 00:10:58,615
<i>you've got no leverage.</i>

123
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,207
<i>At this point, Art,</i>

124
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,418
<i>if you don't get his signature
by the end of the week,</i>

125
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:05,431
<i>rest assured, the bank
will take your home.</i>

126
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,195
Oh, and this, this is
our backyard.

127
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,648
No.

128
00:11:08,682 --> 00:11:10,481
You would be amazed at
the size of the lemons we grow.

129
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:14,736
That's beautiful. That's
just beautiful.

130
00:11:14,771 --> 00:11:17,435
You know, my father,
<i>alav ha-shalom,</i>

131
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,722
always used to say, "the
home, is the heart."

132
00:11:20,756 --> 00:11:24,319
Open home, open heart.

133
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:25,979
You're gonna have a
very lucky kid.

134
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:37,084
I should probably move that.

135
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:39,402
What happened to her?

136
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:46,355
What can I say, her name
was <i>Sarah Scheindal.</i>

137
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,266
We prayed, we hoped, we...
searched.

138
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,617
And eventually we found her.

139
00:11:55,004 --> 00:11:57,010
Yeah, it was terrible.
Just terrible.

140
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:00,436
You don't need to know.
That's enough of all this.

141
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:03,687
Sorry, I was just um...

142
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:07,250
Well your wife has
just been showing me pictures.

143
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:10,952
Such a home. My son, the
real estate <i>machor</i>.

144
00:12:14,722 --> 00:12:17,213
To new beginnings, hmm?

145
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:19,912
<i>L'chaim.</i>

146
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:20,984
- <i>L'chaim.</i>
- L'chaim.

147
00:12:21,435 --> 00:12:22,887
To life.

148
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:24,236
To life.

149
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:30,152
Oh! That must be Heimish.

150
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:32,400
No rest for the wicked!

151
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:36,759
<i>Did the schmuck arrive?</i>

152
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:38,558
It's open! It's open!

153
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:42,778
Even the dead are impatient.

154
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,999
Now...

155
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:49,870
You wanna do a <i>mitzvah</i>?

156
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:23,392
Well look who it is, huh?

157
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:25,225
The prodigal son returns.

158
00:13:26,783 --> 00:13:28,027
How you doin', <i>boychik</i>?

159
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:32,352
Good to see you, Heimish.

160
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:33,839
I heard you piped a <i>shiksa</i>.

161
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:36,088
Don't worry, we'll convert her.

162
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:38,130
Heimish. Behave.

163
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:44,875
So, Reb" Arthur, what
brings you to Brooklyn?

164
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,985
You miss my <i>kugel</i>?

165
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,437
Call my wife a <i>shiksa</i> again,

166
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:51,274
I'll cock you in the mouth.

167
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:53,627
What? You come to make
peace before the baby's born?

168
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:57,433
That's very wise.

169
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:59,542
Look at you, the great
business <i>machor</i>

170
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:01,480
helping us with the grunt work.

171
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:03,383
Such humility, Arthur.

172
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:05,700
You're an idiot.

173
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:08,088
You smell that?

174
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,789
It smells like <i>chazer</i>.

175
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:15,006
You got a problem with my diet?

176
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,431
I wasn't talking about
your diet, <i>boychik</i>.

177
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:21,371
Something wrong?

178
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:24,277
Nothing at all. Right Arthur?

179
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:27,287
Nothing.

180
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:29,017
Just like old times.

181
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:36,973
Oi...

182
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:38,876
What happened?

183
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,880
<i>Nebach</i>.

184
00:14:39,914 --> 00:14:41,816
Sruli ruled it a suicide.

185
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,380
You knew him?

Yosille Fishbein.
Brilliant scholar.

187
00:14:49,392 --> 00:14:52,819
After his wife
died, became a recluse.

188
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:56,346
Last I heard, he got
lost in the esoteric.

189
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,390
Desperate to contact
the wife on the other side.

190
00:15:01,604 --> 00:15:03,784
It was only a few months ago,

191
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:06,067
that we did the funeral for her.

192
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:09,803
He tried everything
to save her life.

193
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:11,291
What's a man without his wife?

194
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:15,615
A good man.

195
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:21,842
Such is life.

196
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:23,363
What a riddle.

197
00:15:33,397 --> 00:15:34,641
Amen.

198
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:37,098
Amen.

199
00:15:37,132 --> 00:15:39,070
Sarah Scheindal's
ferry is confirmed

200
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,662
we're all good on tomorrow.

201
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:42,321
Good.

202
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:43,982
You keep that on your head.

203
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:47,927
Some things never change.

204
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:51,384
Saul, can I have a quick word?

205
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:54,671
Go ahead. I"ll get it started.

206
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,888
Don"t forget <i>tachrisim</i>.

207
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,826
Ah, he knows, he knows.

208
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,141
Ah, he's going to mess it up.

209
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:03,147
He's not going to mess it up.

210
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:04,808
Don't mess it up.

212
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:39,471
Oh my God.

213
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:25,482
You really don't find
it suspicious

214
00:17:25,516 --> 00:17:28,871
that he shows up
after all this time?

215
00:17:28,905 --> 00:17:31,051
You should've heard him on
the phone.

216
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:33,196
He really wants to start again.

217
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,274
It took a lot of growth
to come here.

218
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:38,870
I know he's your son.

219
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:41,810
But all is not butter
that comes from the cow.

220
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:44,750
You don't have the heart of a
young man no more.

221
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:45,857
Don't you love him?

222
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:50,147
Yeah, of course I love him.

223
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:51,841
But I don't trust him.

224
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Arthur, you alright?
Yeah, everything's good.

226
00:18:57,744 --> 00:19:00,719
You mess it up?

227
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:04,351
I swear the <i>farkakte</i> wiring
has a mind of its own.

228
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:10,959
You okay?

229
00:19:10,993 --> 00:19:12,031
Uh hmm.

230
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,867
Still scared of the dark?

231
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:16,390
Boo!

232
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:17,531
Very funny...

233
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:22,652
Just a little <i>rigor mortis.</i>

234
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:26,110
The body's last hurrah.

235
00:19:27,738 --> 00:19:28,879
Yeah, I'm starting to remember.

236
00:19:47,213 --> 00:19:51,399
Why don't you check on
Claire? Hmm?

237
00:19:51,434 --> 00:19:53,336
What? Did I do something wrong?

238
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,721
No, no, no, no, no.

239
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:58,630
I'll finish up here. We
can do the rest tomorrow.

240
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:00,878
Go.

241
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:02,054
Go and get some rest.

242
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:10,115
Dad, can I ask you a question?

243
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:12,121
Of course.

244
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:19,836
I...

245
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,218
Don't matter. Another time.

246
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:26,442
Heimish takes good
care of me. You know?

247
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:27,689
Try to get along.

248
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:30,802
Oh and Art...

249
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:33,258
I'm glad you're back.

250
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:35,610
M-me too.

251
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:23,419
Yosille, Yosille...

252
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:25,555
What have you been up to?

253
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:32,977
Art?

254
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:38,082
Art?

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

256
00:27:29,954 --> 00:27:31,288
<i>After these words,</i>

257
00:27:31,322 --> 00:27:35,759
<i>God asks Abraham to sacrifice

258

<i>But we must ask,</i>

259
00:27:38,128 --> 00:27:40,130
is this a God to believe in?

260
00:27:40,164 --> 00:27:42,266
<i>A God who plays cruel mind
games with his loyal servants?</i>

261

<i>Our Holy Zohar explains what

Shalom's warehouse.

263
00:27:51,408 --> 00:27:53,177
Hello, Reb Chayim?

264
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,045
I-it's Saul.

265
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,081
- <i>Saul?</i>
- Yes, I need a favor.

266
00:27:57,114 --> 00:27:58,249
Sure.

267
00:27:58,282 --> 00:27:59,383
I may have found something.

268
00:28:00,351 --> 00:28:04,121
<i>Ayin, koof, dales.</i>

269
00:28:04,154 --> 00:28:04,788
<i>This is on the knife?</i>

270
00:28:04,822 --> 00:28:07,057
Yeah, this is on the knife.

271
00:28:07,091 --> 00:28:08,859
<i>Koof, dales,</i>

272
00:28:08,892 --> 00:28:10,327
<i>and saf.</i>

273
00:28:10,361 --> 00:28:11,829
It's an ancient warding
inscription.

274
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:14,131
What, you know of this?

275
00:28:14,164 --> 00:28:19,169
It's a... one of God's
hidden names written backwords.

276
00:28:19,203 --> 00:28:21,305
It's for invoking sheidim,

277
00:28:21,338 --> 00:28:23,007
<i>and for sealing them.</i>

278
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,441
Sealing them?

279
00:28:24,475 --> 00:28:27,444
Yeah, often in a body, but uh...

280
00:28:27,478 --> 00:28:31,815
honestly Saul, I, I wouldn't pay
it too much attention.

281
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:34,018
It's an old <i>buba maisa.</i>

282
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:35,352
<i>I mean, today's world,</i>

283
00:28:35,386 --> 00:28:37,888
<i>who has the know-how
to seal a demon in a body?</i>

284
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:40,057
And what if someone did?

285
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,158
Alright, look.

286
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:43,160
Was there a pendant?

287
00:28:43,193 --> 00:28:44,228
<i>What</i>?

288
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:46,430
On the body.
Was there a pendant,

289
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:49,466
<i>an amulet of some sort,
preserving a holy letter?</i>

290
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,268
- No, no.
- You sure?

291
00:28:51,302 --> 00:28:53,570
Yes of course, just, just
the blade.

292
00:28:53,605 --> 00:28:55,539
So what's the drama?

293
00:28:55,572 --> 00:28:58,208
No pendant, no seal.

294
00:28:58,242 --> 00:28:59,576
Which means, there is
no way you picked up

295
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:01,211
a body containing a demon.

296
00:29:01,245 --> 00:29:02,446
<i>But say you did.</i>

297
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:04,548
The worst an
entity like this can do,

298
00:29:04,581 --> 00:29:05,916
<i>is mess with your mind.</i>

299
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:08,118
It's powerless whilst
it's in a body.

300
00:29:08,152 --> 00:29:09,853
But honestly Saul,

301
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:12,222
unless you're in the
business of burning bodies...

302
00:29:12,256 --> 00:29:13,257
<i>I wouldn't worry about it.</i>

303
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,092
Worse things have
happened to the Jews, Saul.

304
00:29:16,226 --> 00:29:17,494
<i>OK?</i>

305
00:29:17,528 --> 00:29:19,196
Have a good <i>Shabbos</i>.

306
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:20,864
Have a good <i>Shabbos</i>.

307
00:29:20,898 --> 00:29:22,266
<i>Alright, bye.</i>

308
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:32,476
Ah!

309
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:34,178
Look who it is!

310
00:29:34,211 --> 00:29:35,245
What are you up to?

311
00:29:36,947 --> 00:29:38,349
Oh, just a little morning read.

312
00:29:40,584 --> 00:29:42,152
You haven't seen Art?

313
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:44,588
Woke up early, offered to help.

314
00:29:45,255 --> 00:29:46,423
Really?

315
00:29:46,457 --> 00:29:48,225
Yeah, I don't know
what you've done with him.

316
00:29:48,258 --> 00:29:49,293
Who knew?

317
00:29:50,662 --> 00:29:51,962
Hungry?

318
00:29:53,464 --> 00:29:55,332
Starving.

319
00:30:09,346 --> 00:30:10,481

00:31:19,216 --> 00:31:20,771
Oh, come on Saul.

323
00:31:20,806 --> 00:31:22,152
You're driving yourself crazy.

324
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,979
Hello?

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000

326
00:34:29,256 --> 00:34:30,878
Yes?

327
00:34:30,913 --> 00:34:32,986
Art, it's Jake Bennett.
How are we holding?

328
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:38,996
Art's busy right now, can I take
a message? I'm his assistant.

329
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:42,313
Look, just let him
know that we met his terms,

330
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:45,594
<i>but the bank was clear.
He won't be getting a loan</i>

331
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:48,532
<i>unless we have his father's
place as collateral.</i>

332
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:52,849
<i>We need him to sign the
contracttonight or this deal goes away.</i>

333
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:54,232
I'll be sure to tell him.

334
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:54,102
Oh!

335
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:55,206
Claire?

336
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:57,761
Look at you.

337
00:35:59,352 --> 00:36:01,976
Every Friday night,

338
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:04,569
the men sing to their
wives and...

339
00:36:04,603 --> 00:36:09,265
and tell them that beauty
is just a passing breath.

340
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,583
But their kindness, their
humanity,

341
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:15,588
that is what every soul
truly desires.

342
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:19,907
We're a very misunderstood
people.

343
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:23,844
It's the burden of investing so
much

344
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:25,883
in internal meaning, it's...

345
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:29,200
it's hard for outsiders to see.

346
00:36:30,513 --> 00:36:32,066
Y'know...

347
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:34,070
comforting others didn't really,

348
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
prepare me for my own grief.
I...
I should have...

349
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:46,575
spoken to Art more, maybe
shouted less, I don't know.

350
00:36:47,716 --> 00:36:49,202
Sometimes,

351
00:36:49,237 --> 00:36:51,654
reflection comes too late.

352
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:52,759
Hmm?

353
00:36:54,522 --> 00:36:55,903
Are you alright?

354
00:36:57,493 --> 00:37:00,981
Can I ask you something, Saul?

355
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:02,364
Yeah, of course. Anything.

356
00:37:03,677 --> 00:37:05,680
Er...

357
00:37:05,716 --> 00:37:08,963
Do souls ever call out
to you for,

358
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:10,241
for help?

359
00:37:12,037 --> 00:37:14,523
The dead are just like the
living, Claire.

360
00:37:15,284 --> 00:37:16,839
They still need love.

361
00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:21,158
You know what
your son is up to Saul?

362
00:37:21,192 --> 00:37:22,745
Heimish!

363
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,198
He things you're a
piece of toast to butter up.

364
00:37:24,232 --> 00:37:26,027
Go ahead, tell him!

365
00:37:26,062 --> 00:37:27,583
- Tell him!
- Tell me what?

366
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:29,276
All this, it's a game Saul!

367
00:37:30,173 --> 00:37:31,729
It's a game.

368
00:37:31,763 --> 00:37:32,799
He's a <i>ganav</i>.

369
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,665
- What did you...
- A thief.

370
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:36,287
That is not...

371
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:37,014
They're selling this
whole place from under you...

372
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:38,464
What? What you talking about...

373
00:37:38,499 --> 00:37:39,778
They didn't come here
to reconcile Saul.

374
00:37:39,813 --> 00:37:40,987
They came here to use you!

375
00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:43,129
That is not, that is not
true. Dad...

376
00:37:43,163 --> 00:37:45,823
He's committed your property
to some <i>goyishe</i> land developer...

377
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:47,032
That is not true!

378
00:37:47,068 --> 00:37:48,172
I'm sorry but th-that
is outrageous.

379
00:37:48,207 --> 00:37:49,899
That is not the case, ok Dad?

380
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:50,970
- Yes it is!
- I can explain...

381
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,894
You knew about this?

382
00:38:10,732 --> 00:38:12,113
- What was that?
- It doesn't matter.

383
00:38:12,148 --> 00:38:13,218
- Can you just...
- We're leaving.

384
00:38:13,253 --> 00:38:14,600
Can you just talk to me?

385
00:38:14,634 --> 00:38:16,637
Claire, can we do this later?

386
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,437
No, we can't!

387
00:38:21,268 --> 00:38:23,306
Everything's gonna be fine,
okay?

388
00:38:23,341 --> 00:38:24,653
Art, I want the truth.

389
00:38:37,642 --> 00:38:40,095
I haven't been able to
sell a house in two years.

390
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:48,525
It's okay, I talked to the bank,
refinanced the house...

391
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,561
You refinanced the house?

392
00:38:53,223 --> 00:38:57,472
You told me that you had
everything under control.

393
00:38:57,507 --> 00:39:00,926
I-I left my job. I didn't have
to do that. You told me,

394
00:39:00,962 --> 00:39:02,758
that everything was okay.

395
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:05,728
And then here I am, choosing
colours for the baby's room

396
00:39:05,763 --> 00:39:07,041
and picking furniture when we're
on the verge...

397
00:39:07,076 --> 00:39:08,492
We're not on the verge...

398
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:10,254
You know, you were
lying to me for two years.

399
00:39:12,362 --> 00:39:15,920
We're supposed to be a
family. We're having a baby.

400
00:39:18,061 --> 00:39:20,962
What was your plan, Art?

401
00:39:20,997 --> 00:39:22,033
Huh?

402
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,968
I mean, what were you thinking?

403
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,945
Did you see his face downstairs?

404
00:39:35,992 --> 00:39:38,029
Let me tell you
about downstairs.

405
00:39:38,064 --> 00:39:41,795
That God, love and holiness.
That's a lie.

406
00:39:43,177 --> 00:39:45,906
I watched my mother rot
in that room,

407
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,222
and when I needed him,
you know what he told me to do?

408
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:51,502
He told me to go away
to synagogue and pray.

409
00:39:51,537 --> 00:39:53,264
So I prayed.

410
00:39:53,298 --> 00:39:56,443
I prayed and I prayed,
"God don't take her.

411
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:59,793
God have mercy.
God don't hurt her!"

412
00:39:59,828 --> 00:40:01,072
I cried so much to God,

413
00:40:01,106 --> 00:40:03,385
there were no more words
left on the page.

414
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:08,050
You need to go
down there and talk to him

415
00:40:08,084 --> 00:40:10,226
and make this right.

416
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:12,678
If we leave now, you'll
always regret it.

417
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:19,140
I didn't come here to
butter him up

418
00:40:19,174 --> 00:40:20,417
Okay? I-

419
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:22,180
I wasn't going to sell
the house from under him.

420
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:26,982
I just needed to find the right
moment to ask him face to face.

421
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:28,812
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

422
00:40:31,748 --> 00:40:33,096
I'm sorry.

423
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:37,310
I'm sorry.

424
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,320

Ah!

429
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:45,318
Dad?

430
00:44:50,016 --> 00:44:51,813
What's going on?

431
00:45:01,244 --> 00:45:02,453
Dad?

432
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,116

433
00:45:09,328 --> 00:45:10,571
Hum.. What happened?

434
00:45:10,605 --> 00:45:12,264
What happened?

435
00:45:12,298 --> 00:45:13,784
His heart...

436
00:45:13,818 --> 00:45:15,373
gave up.

437
00:45:15,407 --> 00:45:16,686
No.

438
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:32,473
You broke it.

439
00:45:53,996 --> 00:45:57,830
Would you all just mind um...

440
00:45:57,865 --> 00:45:59,433
Could you g... just give
me a minute?

441
00:47:14,308 --> 00:47:16,543
Oh she's so sad. So sad.

442
00:47:47,408 --> 00:47:49,243
I didn't know he was sick.

443
00:47:51,412 --> 00:47:53,514
Saul, he wasn't a complainer.

444
00:47:54,181 --> 00:47:55,949
Oh.

445
00:47:57,184 --> 00:47:59,186
His heart was ailing him
for a while or...

446
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:01,255

Oh, of course.
Here they are again.

450
00:50:11,786 --> 00:50:13,320
I don't know
how they get their energy,

451
00:50:13,353 --> 00:50:14,588
you know? So fast.

452
00:50:17,124 --> 00:50:19,560

Ok.

478

Let's go home, Arthur.

479
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:52,432
It's okay.

480
00:55:03,611 --> 00:55:05,680
This a joke? Art...

481
00:55:05,713 --> 00:55:06,781
It's not like you're asking us

482
00:55:06,814 --> 00:55:08,448
to lug a sofa out of the garage.

483
00:55:08,481 --> 00:55:09,650

Look, you still got the
admission pages.

Body was due to ship out two
days ago.

487

It's a suicide! We
need a police report.

What?

489
00:55:18,192 --> 00:55:19,861
You know, where's Heimish?

490
00:55:21,195 --> 00:55:22,864
He doesn't work here anymore.

491
00:55:22,897 --> 00:55:25,099
You still have the telephone?

492
00:55:25,132 --> 00:55:27,134
Let's just say I deleted
his number.

493
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:28,603

Unless you can transfer
custody to a next of kin.

495
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:33,040
You're going to have
to wait for police clearance.

put your <i>broigus</i> aside.

00:55:38,112 --> 00:55:39,881

01:03:32,186 --> 01:03:33,954
she's the wife
of the man downstairs.

549
01:03:33,987 --> 01:03:35,289
Claire?

550
01:03:44,498 --> 01:03:46,100
Must we wait?

551
01:03:47,702 --> 01:03:49,303
My sweet husband.

552
01:03:50,504 --> 01:03:52,506
I just take to see his face.

553
01:03:53,407 --> 01:03:54,408
Please.

554
01:04:02,449 --> 01:04:03,917
Please?

555
01:04:08,956 --> 01:04:10,625
Don't worry.

556
01:04:33,547 --> 01:04:36,049
What a sweet time.

557
01:04:46,193 --> 01:04:48,328
Shouldn't be much longer
for you.

558
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:49,963
What?

559
01:04:49,997 --> 01:04:52,132
The baby. Shouldn't be
much longer.

560
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,636
I can tell with these things.

561
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:05,078
This one.

562
01:05:05,112 --> 01:05:06,748
How do you know that?

563
01:05:06,781 --> 01:05:08,982
It's written right there
on the wall.

564
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:15,522
My hands... won't you?

565
01:05:17,692 --> 01:05:21,295
Uh, maybe we should wait.

566
01:05:21,328 --> 01:05:24,598
For what? A drawer? Please!

567
01:05:38,178 --> 01:05:39,714
You know this man.

568
01:05:41,248 --> 01:05:42,449
Don't you?

569
01:05:49,223 --> 01:05:51,091
Why Yosille?

570
01:05:51,124 --> 01:05:53,427
He should have listened.

571
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,596
What have you done to me?

572
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:58,733
Not me, your dream.

573
01:05:58,766 --> 01:06:00,367
You've been infected.

574
01:06:04,238 --> 01:06:08,743
Soon, your child will join
countless others.

575
01:06:08,776 --> 01:06:11,411
The many lost souls,
calling out for help.

576
01:06:12,647 --> 01:06:15,582
Only you can stop this curse.

577
01:06:15,617 --> 01:06:17,451
Before it's too late.

578
01:06:18,853 --> 01:06:20,688
The pendant?

579
01:06:30,632 --> 01:06:32,099
Burn it!

580
01:06:34,468 --> 01:06:37,571
From this, do we suffer.

581
01:06:37,605 --> 01:06:40,340
From this, will you suffer?

582
01:06:40,374 --> 01:06:42,610
Hurry! Burn it!

583
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

584
01:07:21,315 --> 01:07:22,416
Come on, please.

585
01:08:27,815 --> 01:08:29,383
Oh God!

586
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:39,292
No!

587
01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:45,800
<i>Claire?</i>

588
01:08:45,833 --> 01:08:47,300
- Art?
<i>- Closer.</i>

589
01:08:47,869 --> 01:08:49,202
Art?

590
01:08:49,236 --> 01:08:50,404
<i>Closer!</i>

591
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

592
01:10:09,349 --> 01:10:10,517
Claire?

593
01:10:14,088 --> 01:10:16,490
What are you doing Arthur?

594
01:10:18,592 --> 01:10:19,794
Sarah?

595
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:24,431
Where's my wife?

596
01:10:31,404 --> 01:10:33,708
Oh Claire, Claire, Claire!

597
01:10:33,741 --> 01:10:35,643
Please, Claire!

598
01:10:35,676 --> 01:10:38,713
Claire wake, please.
What did you do?

599
01:10:38,746 --> 01:10:40,480
W-what did you do?

600
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:44,685
- Okay, okay...
- Art, something's wrong.

601
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:46,954
Okay, we're, we're
getting outta here.

602
01:11:05,106 --> 01:11:07,574
A life, for a life.

603
01:11:10,077 --> 01:11:11,779
Art, something's wrong!

604
01:11:11,813 --> 01:11:13,513
Something's wrong.

605
01:11:27,161 --> 01:11:28,830
Shall we make a deal?

606
01:11:49,951 --> 01:11:51,551
No more pain.

607
01:11:52,653 --> 01:11:53,955
No more fear.

608
01:11:56,090 --> 01:11:57,457
You want me to get you a child.

609
01:12:00,527 --> 01:12:01,863
No.

610
01:12:17,544 --> 01:12:19,046
Shut up!

611
01:12:46,173 --> 01:12:47,708
Please don't hang up.

612
01:13:11,032 --> 01:13:12,499
Show me the tape.

613
01:13:15,169 --> 01:13:19,740
<i>Get out!</i>

614
01:13:26,614 --> 01:13:27,815
<i>Sarah!</i>

615
01:13:30,651 --> 01:13:32,787
<i>What are you?</i>

616
01:13:36,523 --> 01:13:39,592
This, this thing...

617
01:13:41,295 --> 01:13:42,562
it's in the house?

618
01:13:44,098 --> 01:13:45,465
I think so.

619
01:13:48,002 --> 01:13:50,171
It has my wife.

620
01:13:55,142 --> 01:13:56,844
What do I do?

621
01:13:59,246 --> 01:14:00,513
I know a <i>Kabbalist</i>.

622
01:14:11,325 --> 01:14:12,760
Heimish.

623
01:14:13,894 --> 01:14:15,096
Arthur.

624
01:14:25,172 --> 01:14:26,207
What is that thing?

625
01:14:28,609 --> 01:14:29,677
A sigil.

626
01:14:32,713 --> 01:14:36,283
An altar, a sacrificial
altar to those who enter it.

627
01:14:39,987 --> 01:14:41,521
Did you feed it?

628
01:14:42,256 --> 01:14:43,257
What?

629
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:45,159
Did your wife go in this sigil?

630
01:14:46,127 --> 01:14:47,128
Uh...

631
01:14:48,963 --> 01:14:50,765
I don't know.

632
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:54,101
Where is Yosille's body?

633
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:00,174
It's been freed.

634
01:15:00,207 --> 01:15:01,342
It's vessel's been shattered.

635
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:02,910
What is this thing?

636
01:15:06,047 --> 01:15:07,547
Bringer of miscarriages.

637
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:11,052
Taker of children.

638
01:15:17,792 --> 01:15:21,128
I must finish, what
Yosille started!

639
01:15:21,162 --> 01:15:22,630
Where's the rest of it?

640
01:15:22,663 --> 01:15:24,331
- I...
- Where's the rest of it?

641
01:15:27,168 --> 01:15:30,805
Since before the era of
concealment,

642
01:15:30,838 --> 01:15:35,009
Abyzou has been inflicting
misery and miscarriage

643
01:15:35,042 --> 01:15:39,013
forcing the bereaved and
the desperate to feed it.

644
01:15:39,046 --> 01:15:40,314
Until God intervened,

645
01:15:41,882 --> 01:15:43,184
and called upon Abraham to...

646
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:46,020
sacrifice his son.

647
01:15:46,053 --> 01:15:47,655
Forever binding Abyzou.

648
01:15:48,789 --> 01:15:50,758
Until Yosille brought it back.

649
01:15:51,992 --> 01:15:54,295
It'll make you see things.

650
01:15:54,328 --> 01:15:56,397
Feel things that aren't real.

651
01:15:56,430 --> 01:15:58,866
Whatever it takes to get what it
wants.

652
01:15:58,899 --> 01:16:01,068
A child inside that sigil.

653
01:16:02,236 --> 01:16:05,372
But with this pendant, we can
bind it,

654
01:16:05,406 --> 01:16:08,109
and our prayers will force it
inside.

655
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:12,847
Only we determine how much good,

656
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,882
and evil enter our realm.

657
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:17,685
So how do I kill it?

658
01:16:19,019 --> 01:16:20,154
There is no kill.

659
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:24,425
You trap it.

660
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:25,960
How?

661
01:16:33,434 --> 01:16:34,902
Like Yosille did.

662
01:16:53,787 --> 01:16:55,156
And this would save my wife?

663
01:16:57,424 --> 01:16:58,859
And my baby?

664
01:17:15,242 --> 01:17:16,944
We have no time.

665
01:17:16,977 --> 01:17:18,012
Chayim, there must be
something else we can do.

666
01:17:18,045 --> 01:17:19,180
There must be another way.

667
01:17:19,213 --> 01:17:21,482
There's no other way.

668
01:17:21,515 --> 01:17:24,985
You must complete the entirety
of the binding ritual.

669
01:17:25,019 --> 01:17:28,022
Once I finish the ash circle, do
not stop.

670
01:17:31,192 --> 01:17:32,259
Stay in the circle!

671
01:17:54,481 --> 01:17:55,916
Do it quickly.

672
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:56,884
I'm going as fast as I can.

673
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:58,252
We don't know
what this thing c...

674
01:18:00,454 --> 01:18:01,488
Heimish.

675
01:18:04,858 --> 01:18:06,760
Why don't you hear me?

676
01:18:08,262 --> 01:18:09,797
God, please!

677
01:18:10,331 --> 01:18:11,999
Dad?

678
01:18:13,867 --> 01:18:15,436
Art... Arthur?

679
01:18:15,469 --> 01:18:17,238
H-how did you?

680
01:18:18,906 --> 01:18:20,507
Do what it wants.

681
01:18:21,342 --> 01:18:22,509
I was a fool.

682
01:18:24,411 --> 01:18:27,815
D-don't leave me,
don't leave me, please!

683
01:18:28,582 --> 01:18:30,517
Save your wife!

684
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:34,188
What are you doing?

685
01:18:34,221 --> 01:18:36,090
Hey! Arthur!

686
01:18:36,123 --> 01:18:37,424
- Arthur!
- I saw my father.

687
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:39,326
No, no, no!

688
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,495
Whatever you saw, that
wasn't your father.

689
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:44,898
This.

690
01:18:46,967 --> 01:18:48,002
Hold it.

691
01:18:50,104 --> 01:18:51,805
This was your father.

692
01:18:51,839 --> 01:18:52,806
Okay?

693
01:19:04,184 --> 01:19:05,986
Finish the circle.

694
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:07,021
Stay in it.

695
01:19:18,098 --> 01:19:19,366
Heimish!

696
01:19:24,471 --> 01:19:25,472
Heimish!

697
01:19:31,613 --> 01:19:32,913
No!

698
01:19:38,285 --> 01:19:39,420
Heimish!

699
01:20:27,602 --> 01:20:29,036
Art?

700
01:20:30,137 --> 01:20:31,205
Art.

701
01:20:32,206 --> 01:20:34,141
Claire.

702
01:21:11,412 --> 01:21:12,946
Claire!

703
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,448
- Help.
- Claire!

704
01:21:14,481 --> 01:21:15,983
Art!

705
01:21:19,687 --> 01:21:20,954
Art!

706
01:21:20,988 --> 01:21:22,055
Claire!

707
01:21:24,491 --> 01:21:25,693
Art!

708
01:21:27,327 --> 01:21:28,429
Art, please!

709
01:21:33,133 --> 01:21:34,234
Art!

710
01:21:45,512 --> 01:21:46,648
Art!

711
01:21:49,651 --> 01:21:52,252
Please, help me!

712
01:22:22,349 --> 01:22:24,051
Amen.

713
01:23:13,534 --> 01:23:15,202
Art!

714
01:23:24,578 --> 01:23:26,413
No!

715
01:23:37,291 --> 01:23:38,258
Heimish.

716
01:23:39,159 --> 01:23:40,160
Heimish.

717
01:24:07,521 --> 01:24:08,723
Do it!

718
01:24:08,756 --> 01:24:10,223
I can't do it!

719
01:24:10,257 --> 01:24:11,258
I can't!

720
01:24:12,627 --> 01:24:14,896
- Please!
- Arthur, I can't do this

721
01:24:14,929 --> 01:24:16,530
Do it!

722
01:24:18,365 --> 01:24:19,433
Do it!

723
01:24:41,656 --> 01:24:43,557
You should've stayed in
the circle.

724
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

725
01:26:56,389 --> 01:26:57,390
Art!

726
01:26:57,892 --> 01:26:58,960
Claire.

727
01:27:00,061 --> 01:27:01,595
Thank God, are you ok?

728
01:27:01,629 --> 01:27:02,830
- Yeah, are you ok?
- Yeah!

729
01:27:02,864 --> 01:27:04,364
- Is the baby ok?
- Yeah.

730
01:27:04,397 --> 01:27:05,565
Good.

731
01:27:12,707 --> 01:27:13,741
Claire?
