Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

2
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,585
What is the supernatural?
Hmm? Anyone?

3
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,259
Like ghosts or spirits or devils?

4
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,939
Those are examples.

5
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,317
Actions or events which we
cannot explain through science.

6
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,485
Good.

7
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,696
Before the discovery of a
pathogenic theory of medicine,

8
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,896
people believed that sickness
was caused by evil spirits.

9
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,660
A show of hands, if you get sick,

10
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,746
who here would rather see
a priest before a doctor?

11
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,817
Who here believes in God?

12
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,744
Heaven? Hell?

13
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,914
The apocalypse?

14
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,074
Ghosts?

15
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,417
Really? No one here believes
in ghosts. Interesting.

16
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,516
David Q., one of my first patients,

17
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:31,091
was a perfectly normal
12-year-old boy.

18
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,522
One day, that all changed.

19
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,596
<i>Who are you drawing, David?</i>

20
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,853
You know.

21
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,229
<i>Tell me again, to the camera.</i>

22
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>Mr. Gregor,</i>
<i>the man that makes things happen.</i>

23
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,560
What if you could prove that
the supernatural was merely

24
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,564
a manifestation of what already
exists in the mind, the subconscious?

25
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,691
- What you're doing is immoral.
- Traitor.

26
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,318
That was disgusting.
How dare you do that?

27
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,653
- It's not disgusting!
- You left!

28
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,933
No, don't take it personally.
Don't take it personally.

29
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,568
The onus is on the scientist
to prove himself.

30
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,607
So, where to start?
With the individual.

31
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,658
You cure one patient,
you cure all mankind.

32
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,547
You have no idea.

33
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:40,756
You don't get to have an opinion.

34
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,550
- You don't know how crazy...
- It's so bizarre.

35
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:46,080
Harry, will you take
that for me? And this?

36
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,837
Phillip, you're
welcome back anytime.

37
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,253
Let's have a chat. I'll see
you guys back at the house.

38
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,848
<i>There's not much of a budget,
everyone's working for science.</i>

39
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:05,683
Your job would be to document
every step of the experiment.

40
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,601
I hope you don't scare easily.

41
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,860
Do you speak?

42
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,858
Of course.

43
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,369
Tell me about yourself, Brian.

44
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,867
There's not much to tell.

45
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,592
I like cameras, that's
my nature, I guess.

46
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,302
To be curious?

47
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,795
To film.

48
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,681
And what's your passion?

49
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,849
Passion?

50
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,228
Yes, what story are you looking
for with that camera of yours?

51
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,631
I don't know, everything.

52
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,552
Are you a believer?

53
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,566
My mother's religious.

54
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,732
My father's a banker, a clerk.

55
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,198
My father works in town,
my mother is at home.

56
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,074
Hmm.

57
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,861
I wonder,

58
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,746
are you avoiding my question out of a
reluctance to talk about yourself,

59
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,243
or because you're
genuinely confused?

60
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:14,589
Uh, I suppose I don't know
what I believe in yet.

61
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,178
Well, that's fair enough.

62
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,762
Well, Brian,

63
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,678
welcome to the experiment.
You are our official chronicler.

64
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:39,500
I work with the A.V., the
audiovisual department.

65
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,619
But you are a student here, no?

66
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,630
No, I'd never get in here.

67
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,132
So how did you get involved
with the Experiment?

68
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,878
I volunteered as a subject.

69
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,224
Professor Coupland, or
Joseph if you like,

70
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,377
he thought I was all wrong.

71
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,717
Not tortured enough, apparently.

72
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:05,226
He already had someone
truly psychotic.

73
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,399
<i>I see someone.</i>

74
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,986
<i>Good, Jane. Who do you see?</i>

75
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,939
<i>Do you recognize this person?</i>

76
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,160
<i>I don't know. I'm not sure.</i>

77
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,740
<i>A girl... I see a little girl.</i>

78
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,828
<i>No,</i>

79
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,841
<i>maybe a doll.</i>

80
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,684
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

81
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,185
<i>It's okay, you're perfectly safe.</i>

82
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,609
<i>Her name is Evey. I don't like her.</i>

83
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i>The doll's name is Evey?</i>
<i>I just need to sleep.</i>

84
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:14,379
Be quiet! Calm down! It's just
the pipes, it's just the pipes!

85
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,552
Crazy fun, no?

86
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,047
Go on up.

87
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,914
It's for her own protection.

88
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,412
And ours.

89
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,846
What's wrong with her?

90
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,421
Suicidal. She remembers
nothing from her past.

91
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:06,264
Foster child, abandoned.
Passed from house to house.

92
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,011
Families would keep
her for a bit, then,

93
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:15,523
you know, things would happen.

94
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,743
The furniture would move,
objects would catch on fire.

95
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,613
The authorities were
convinced she was possessed.

96
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,367
Luckily, Joseph discovered her.

97
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,245
He ruled out
schizophrenia, the usual.

98
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,077
Then he measured her brain waves.

99
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,951
Frequencies off the charts, look.

100
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,456
That's why he chose her.
He took her from the asylum.

101
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:48,132
Well, Brian, welcome
to the Experiment.

102
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,475
Don't look into her eyes, don't say
anything to her if you can help it.

103
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,982
I can't have the experiment
corrupted by outside influences.

104
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,820
I understand.

105
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,176
What?

106
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,812
Did you think my head
was going to spin off?

107
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,696
Sorry if I disturbed you.

108
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,498
It comes and goes.

109
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,750
Excuse me?

110
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,744
What's inside.

111
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,297
Stop staring at my wrists.

112
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,450
Sorry.

113
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,707
I promised Joseph that
I wouldn't try again,

114
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,715
that I'd give him time.

115
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,049
Is there time?

116
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,729
Um...

117
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,553
Yeah, of course.

118
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,722
Can he cure me?

119
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,680
I'm sure he can.

120
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,476
I just want to get better.

121
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,982
Tell Joseph that I'm ready.

122
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:36,414
Ask him to let me sleep.
I'm begging you.

123
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,414
And, Brian,

124
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,916
thank you.

125
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,972
Seen a ghost?

126
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,826
She knew my name.

127
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,946
She probably heard us talking
about you at some point.

128
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,780
She's no fool.

129
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,577
Um, she said to tell you

130
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,880
that she needs sleep
and that she's ready.

131
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,706
Excellent, that is a good sign.

132
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,721
I really don't know if
I can do this, sir.

133
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:30,878
If you think you're scared,
imagine how she feels, hmm?

134
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:36,299
Besides, aren't you just
a little bit intrigued?

135
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,736
Hey, you! You over there!

136
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:44,232
Is he in? Is he in that house?

137
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,986
I am going to go mad if
this sound does not stop!

138
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,872
What's the point, exactly?

139
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:55,652
Remember, "Cure one
patient, we cure mankind"?

140
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,826
Jane Harper is that patient.

141
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,923
If we can push our subject
to manifest negative energy

142
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,326
in the form of
telekinetic activity,

143
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:10,462
we can harvest that energy and
remove it, like extracting a tumor.

144
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:14,091
We cure mental illness for good.

145
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,516
Are you a skeptic, Brian?

146
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,176
Pardon?

147
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,853
Don't you think we can cure Harper?

148
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:30,020
We can't have non-believers
in this house, Brian.

149
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,197
It's a destructive energy

150
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,696
in a constructive space.

151
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,173
Not again.

152
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:46,043
Harry, will you turn the
music off upstairs?

153
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,929
Well, thank you and
good luck. I'm sorry.

154
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,334
It won't happen again.

155
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,382
You just clap.

156
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,472
Hello, Jane. We've brought
something for you.

157
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,366
You can put all your bad thoughts

158
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,660
and negative energy
into the doll, Jane.

159
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,860
Get rid of them, get
rid of them for good.

160
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,658
Evey doesn't look like this.

161
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,074
She's all wrong.

162
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,907
Why don't you describe
her to me, hmm?

163
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,079
This doll's dead,

164
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,994
inside.

165
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,332
That's what my parents
used to say about my eyes.

166
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,381
They weren't my real parents.

167
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,801
With each new family,
they'd sit me down,

168
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,099
ever so nice,

169
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,766
but I knew soon enough

170
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,766
that they'd hate me too.

171
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,353
That must have been
very painful for you.

172
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,615
I scared them, all of them.

173
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,278
You're not possessed, Jane.
You're just unwell.

174
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,406
I just want to sleep,

175
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,038
forever.

176
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,056
Aren't you concerned that Jane
Harper will take her own life?

177
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,226
That's why we keep her under
surveillance and medicated.

178
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:22,731
So, why are you working on
this experiment, Harry?

179
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,133
Me?

180
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,473
Scientific pursuit.

181
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:31,531
The equipment we're using is
cutting edge, engineer's dream.

182
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,325
Help me!

183
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,662
It's 95 over 70.

184
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,508
So, how did you get into this?

185
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,689
Initially my field was
abnormal psychology,

186
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,609
which, despite the
frightening title,

187
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:12,265
merely indicates the study of
behavior outside the norm.

188
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,826
You run into a lot of charlatans, con
artists, and mental deficients, Brian,

189
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,662
and I disproved them all.

190
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:22,123
Then, there was David Q.

191
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,776
Harry, lights.

192
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,702
<i>Where are you, Mr. Gregor?</i>

193
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:37,044
I think David used the
character of Mr. Gregor

194
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,214
to explain the telekinetic
havoc his mind was wreaking.

195
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,468
The same way Jane is
mentally sculpting Evey?

196
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,136
Exactly.

197
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,136
<i>Why is Mr. Gregor doing
these things, David?</i>

198
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:55,058
<i>I don't know. Mother
says he's evil.</i>

199
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,568
<i>What do you think he is?</i>

200
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,287
<i>He's bad. So am I!</i>

201
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,456
<i>Mr. Gregor is make-believe!
Your mind is creating him.</i>

202
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,905
<i>You can get rid of him.
I can help you!</i>

203
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,933
Mr. Gregor was a character
from a bedtime story

204
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,102
David's father used to tell him.

205
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,021
His parents must feel so guilty.

206
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,424
What happened to David Q.?

207
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,929
He was improving with my
help, but his mother,

208
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:36,031
a religious woman,
terminated the sessions.

209
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,699
We lost touch.

210
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,369
I've heard he's living a
relatively normal life somewhere.

211
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,494
Hello, Joseph.

212
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,999
Gentlemen.

213
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:03,338
Why do I get the impression this
is about to become unpleasant?

214
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,136
We have to move Jane.

215
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,230
- What?
- Why?

216
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,804
They've pulled the funding
for the experiment.

217
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,474
Bloody cowards!

218
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,474
Ah, they're dead already anyway.

219
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,480
Krissi, Harry...

220
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,121
You can leave the experiment
or see this through.

221
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,321
Either way I'll understand.

222
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,905
No, we're with you, Joseph.

223
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,373
All the way.

224
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,388
Cameraman, I'm not well off.

225
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,632
I won't have much left for film.

226
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,968
I'll use cheaper stock.

227
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,674
After all, I'm starting
to be a bit intrigued.

228
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,319
Ah, it's for the best.
Come on, let's pack.

229
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,846
Hmm.

230
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,802
Do you like it?

231
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,597
If it makes me better.

232
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,772
Let's get...

233
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,152
Yeah, one of all of us.

234
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:01,206
Okay, should we go in? I got you.

235
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,198
Just be careful.

236
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,269
EMF scanner.

237
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:39,267
And there's one in each corner and
one on the table. Five in total.

238
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,110
Basically, they pick
up minute changes

239
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,730
in electromagnetic energy fields.

240
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,229
I borrowed them from the
Engineering Department.

241
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,119
So if we can connect
Harper's mental activity,

242
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,739
which is recorded
on the EEG machine,

243
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:59,662
to telekinetic events, then...

244
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,843
So if Evey's made
of negative energy,

245
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,887
then this should
help us identify...

246
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,633
Very good, Brian, very good.

247
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,426
- Are we ready?
- Yeah.

248
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,681
Here we go.

249
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,978
We just want to ask
Evey some questions.

250
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,857
Come on, Evey. Come out.

251
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,197
Come play with us.

252
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,366
One knock for yes, two for no.

253
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,919
God, please, Evey.

254
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Why won't she speak to us?

255
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,712
Damn it, Jane!

256
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,306
I'm trying, Joseph.

257
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,597
Try harder.

258
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,772
So, how do we assess our progress?

259
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:16,113
How do I assess our progress?

260
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:21,444
Patience and courage.
Evey will slowly come to life.

261
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,921
If we survive, we
win a Nobel Prize.

262
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,256
Wait, is there a chance we won't?

263
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,508
Win?

264
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:29,884
Survive.

265
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,878
There's always a chance.

266
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:36,300
"Security is a superstition.
It does not exist in nature.

267

adventure or nothing."

Helen Keller.

270
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,403
Mate, just put it in the bottom
corner. Have you got it?

271
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,267
To brighten things.

272
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,475
Thank you.

273
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,317
You feeling okay?

274
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,402
I'm a disappointment.

275
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,067
I'm taking too long.

276
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,575
I have to find Evey.

277
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,571
<i>Slowly...</i>

278
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,709
<i>Go down into the darkness.</i>

279
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,179
Allow the total
relaxation you're feeling

280
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,709
to plunge you through
any mental chaos.

281
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,261
Deeper.

282
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,090
Ready.

283
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,430
Deeper.

284
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,603
She's in alpha wave state.

285
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,518
How are you feeling?

286
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,775
Lost, alone...

287
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,193
But you're not alone, are you?

288
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,954
Peer into the darkness.

289
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:16,869
There's something there with
you, isn't there? What is it?

290
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,712
Say it, "I'm not alone."

291
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,060
- I am alone.
- Say it!

292
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,806
I'm a failure. Everyone hates me.

293
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I want to die.
Jane, if you're not going to try
you can go back to the chemical...

294
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,367
- Jesus.
- What was that?

295
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,744
The EMF, sensor two.

296
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,746
Something knocked the
camera out of my hand!

297
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,873
I had a firm grip on it.

298
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,291
- Shh, shh!
- Oh, my God, it happened.

299
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,912
Evey was here? Why
didn't you tell us?

300
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,159
She was playing.

301
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,082
Bring her back.

302
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jane, bring her back.

303
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:13,191
We made progress tonight.
A toast. Brian, you make it.

304
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,567
I don't know...

305
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,185
Be quick with it now. No thinking.

306
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,528
Come on.

307
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,930
To Jane.

308
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,978
To Jane!

309
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,408
I think he's falling in love.

310
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,743
My, my.

311
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,578
He'll be bringing her flowers next.

312
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,618
Harry.

313
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,045
Brian, she's had her
sleep. Keep her up.

314
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,477
I love you.

315
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:54,224
Now why would you need to ruin the
mood with that filthy, filthy word?

316
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,566
Good night, Brian.

317
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,139
Good night.

Ow!

319
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,966
Bed broke.

320
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,105
Sorry about that.

321
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,507
I'm not.

322
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,858
Good night, Brian.

323
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,390
You look tired. Why
don't you go to bed.

324
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,222
I'll take over.

325
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,049
Harry.

326
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,673
Come see this.

327
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,678
Can you see her?

328
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,135
Krissi. Krissi!

329
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,141
I need the lights.

330
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,118
Is that enough?

331
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,520
Yeah, yeah, perfect.

332
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,121
Now you feel better, don't you?

333
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,125
May we see her, Jane?

334
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,879
She's pretty.

335
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,887
So, why are you doing this to her?

336
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,472
Hmm?

337
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:44,887
Is Evey losing her hair?
Is she sick?

338
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,896
Is she someone you hated?

339
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,808
Did she hurt you when
you were little?

340
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,152
Jane, please try to remember.

341
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,408
Hey, stop it, stop it!

342
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,581
You must let us help you. Okay?

343
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,871
Help me? God, no.

344
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,089
No one can help me.

345
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,088
They act like I'm invisible.

346
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,345
Do you want to see me disappear?

347
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,676
Sure. Weak pulse.

348
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,766
Brian, look at this.

349
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,531
You see that?

350
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,354
What is that?

351
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,994
Looks like she's been
scratching something.

352
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,396
Shh!

Jane, Jane!

356
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,296
Come on, Krissi, come on,
get up. Come on!

357
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,186
- What is with you?
- Do you want to meet Evey?

358
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,305
- What?
- She's inside me right now.

359
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,218
- Jane.
- Take me.

360
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,360
- Jane!
- She's inside me.

361
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,154
- Feel Evey. You can even touch her.
- What are you doing?

362
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,572
Stop! Stop!

363
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,395
- Let him go.
- Coward.

364
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:20,657
Take your hands out of his
trousers now, please.

365
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,905
Thank you.

366
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:40,100
I'm sorry. It wasn't
what it looked like.

367
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,435
I know.

368
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,351
I don't understand what's going on.

369
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:52,473
It's obvious. She's aware
of your feelings for her,

370
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,784
which could be very
dangerous for you.

371
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,186
Coward.

372
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,943
Better go.

373
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,698
<i>Coward!</i>

374
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's a job.
You can quit anytime. She's
not your responsibility.

375
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,024
Come on.

376
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,780
She's here.

377
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,955
EMF hit, sensors one through five.

378
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,054
Like you to let us talk to
Evey. Will you do that?

379
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,056
One knock for yes, two for no.

380
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,725
EMF sensor five.

381
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,003
- It's so hot.
- She's right there, guys.

382
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,437
There's a fire.

383
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:51,387
No, no, there's no fire.
You're perfectly safe.

384
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,302
Krissi, pass me a candle.

385
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:57,476
Here you are.

386
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,269
Is Evey afraid of fire?

387
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,157
Joseph...

388
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,010
Stop! Stop!

389
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,763
Cameraman, you've scared her off!

390
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,290
We've lost it.

391
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,842
Do that again and you are gone.

392
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,888
Hello?

393
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,565
It's open.

394
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,912
Jane?

395
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,836
Jane?

396
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jane? Jane?

397
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,086
What's that? What have you done?

398
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:34,875
Krissi! Hurry, Krissi!

399
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,727
I don't know. She's
lost three more pounds.

400
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,313
She's painting her body with blood.

401
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:45,844
She's mutilating herself. I'm
sorry, she must see a doctor.

402
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,694
Do you always do this?

403
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,438
Do what?

404
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:55,869
Retreat when you're on the
brink of something meaningful.

405
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,898
I don't know, I've never
thought about it like that...

406
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,408
There's so much you can accomplish.

407
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,969
Evey and I could be friends.

408
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,480
I think I must have always
been naked as a child,

409
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,938
my clothes always off.

410
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,189
Do I look like a woman to you?

411
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,822
Every time I look in the
mirror I see a little girl.

412
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,371
I want to see a woman.

413
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,871
Are you shy?

414
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,669
Don't you want to touch me?

415
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,813
Let me get you out of here.

416
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,557
And go where?

417
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,515
Another asylum? More doctors?

418
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,228
There must be something else we
can do for you other than this.

419
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,574
This?

420
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,147
The Experiment.

421
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,692
You know I can't leave.

422
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,164
Why not?

423
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,033
Joseph would be upset.

424
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,245
You shouldn't worry about him.

425
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:32,538
He rescued me. He saved me.

426
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:38,047
From myself and the likes of you.

427
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,141
Camera operators?

428
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:42,543
Men.

429
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:47,048
Silly, frustrated, violent men,

430
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,561
who want to touch you, but can't
or won't, so they torment you.

431
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:56,103
Not your body, but your
heart and your feelings.

432
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,276
And they set you on
fire to watch you burn.

433
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,897
Is Joseph that kind of man?

434
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,190
Are you?

435
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:22,087
Double it. We're on the verge.

436
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,678
- Here you go, Jane.
- No.

437
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,551
Are you sure?

438
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,984
Krissi. Harry.

439
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,602
Harry.

440
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,604
Brian.

441
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,777
- You want me to...
- Yes.

442
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,108
Okay.

443
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,122
You said there was a fire.

444
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,802
There are flames,

445
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,802
everywhere.

446
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:18,181
The roof, the walls...

447
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,940
It's so hot.

448
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,027
So hot.

449
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,656
So hot.

450
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,615
Evey.

451
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,203
Evey, it's burning!

452
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,498
What do you see, Jane?

453
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:45,959
Tell us.

454
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,719
We can't get out. We're locked in.

455
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,174
Who?

456
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,019
Who's locked in?

457
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,233
Burning...

458
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,321
Burning, burning...

459
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:15,158
Burning! Burning! Burning, Evey!

460
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,999
Oh! Ice, Krissi, ice!

461
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,426
She needs a doctor.

462
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,094
No, no doctor.

463
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Krissi, she needs...
No doctor.
I have ice!

464
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,262
- Jane!
- Oh, my God!

465
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,655
Did we get it on film?

466
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,281
I think I got it, whatever it is.

467
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,367
And what do we think it was?

468
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:47,736
Some friggin' exorcist shit.

469
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,163
It's what you always said.

470
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,415
She manifested her negative energy.

471
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,376
Whatever it was, it scared
the hell out of me.

472
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:58,077
You're scared because you can't
explain what you've seen.

473
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:02,915
So your mind falls back on the
stories that scared you as a child.

474
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:04,844
Evil spirits and such.

475
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,554
How do you explain it?

476
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,628
I'd call it "teleplasm."

477
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:12,386
- That was teleplasm? Bloody hell.
- Mm-hmm.

478
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:15,594
The next step is transference.

479
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:19,734
Once Jane's psychic energy
has found a new home,

480
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,861
we isolate it and get
rid of it for good.

481
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,263
What, now?

482
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:26,741
The psychic floodgates have opened
and we are driving through.

483
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,985
She's hurt, tired.

484
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:32,277
She needs rest and food.

485
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,113
Even God rested on the seventh day.

486
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,334
Hmm.

487
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,782
Interesting.

488
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,172
Krissi?

489
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:44,998
Well, obviously, I want
to go on, Joseph, but

490
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,622
maybe she's earned a rest.

491
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,306
Harry?

492
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,754
Yeah.

493
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,510
Well, it's unanimous.

494
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:58,766
Let's give our subject
a well-deserved break.

495
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:04,972
Come and play.

496
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,241
You got to get him out first.

497
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,643
You ready?

498
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,789
- Yes, that's how it's really done.
- That was pathetic.

499
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,568
Cut that. Cut that out.

500
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:47,014
We need to speak with Evey.

501
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:49,616
She can come and stay right here.

502
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,160
Right here inside this doll.

503
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:57,317
It can be hers and she can
stay there anytime she wants.

504
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,824
I can't find her.

505
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,467
Where are you hiding tonight, Evey?

506
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,260
She's not hiding. She's lost.

507
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,586
She doesn't sound lost.

508
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,894
Are you going to come down and
talk to us? We want to meet you.

509
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,256
- God.
- Stay down!

510
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,716
Joseph...

511
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:36,234
Tell her to come in, Jane.
We just want to talk to her.

512
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Tell her to come in
and play with us.
Play nice.
She's here.

513
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:52,754
How big you've grown, little girl.

514
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:56,683
Big enough to walk. If
you're big enough to walk

515
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,462
you're big enough
to talk. Speak to us!

516
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,231
Please, we just want to be friends.

517
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:04,929
She knows you're lying.

518
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:07,477
What can we do to calm you down?

519
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,244
Where's she gone?

520
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:17,771
I don't know.

521
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,748
Evey!

522
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,112
Come on. Come on.

523
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:34,122
Brian, get out of the way!

524
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:39,926
If you're her friend, you must
leave her be! Let Jane heal.

525
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,729
Tell her, Jane.

526
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,439
Leave, Evey, please.

527
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,690
Say it like you mean it!

528
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,900
Please, Evey!

529
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,859
Have you got something to show us?

530
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,700
Joseph. Joseph.

531
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

532
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:22,101
It bit me!

533
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,300
- Evey's gone, she's gone!
- Are you okay?

534
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:26,056
It bit me!

535
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:35,982
<i>Burning! Burning! Burning, Evey!</i>

536
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,737
<i>God, Jesus Christ!</i>

537
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,701
<i>She needs a doctor!</i>

538
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:14,362
What happens to Jane now
that Evey refuses to leave?

539
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,765
Maybe we burn down the house.

540
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,064
Maybe that's what Harper's
been talking about. Kill Evey.

541
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:24,440
And it'll be a wrap. Good ending.
Yeah, very dramatic.

542
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,691
I'm sorry,

543
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:30,412
are you insinuating that we're
making this whole thing up?

544
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:33,006
That this is somehow staged?

545
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:36,926
Professor hires gullible local
cameraman to make himself famous.

546
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:42,515
Don't be absurd. What
about Jane's burns?

547
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,760
A bit of acid on the
doll, basic chemistry.

548
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,520
I did go to school.

549
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,565
What about the electromagnetic
field readings, the heartbeat?

550
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,150
It's simple enough to fake.

551
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:53,401
And the bite?

552
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:56,772
Self-inflicted when we weren't
looking. And the knocks...

553
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:02,118
Evey? Evey, are you there?

554
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,205
So you break up something under
the table, a metal supported leg.

555
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,707
"Telekinetic event."

556
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:10,501
So what you're saying is
that Joseph is a fraud,

557
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:13,254
and Harry and I are fools, idiots.

558
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:17,342
No, I'm saying this isn't gonna
hold up as scientific proof.

559
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,594
And in the process, we've
tortured a human being,

560
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:22,669
for no other reason than her
sick desire to please him.

561
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,751
<i>What are you doing?</i>

562
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:32,065
Yes, the doll. We saw smoke.

563
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:35,318
They can say it's a fake, that
we hid something in here.

564
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,685
Oh, my God!

565
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,449
Jane?

566
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,399
- Jane. Oh, God.
- Jane. Oh, my God.

567
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,084
She faking this too?

568
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:00,370
I understand this
has been difficult.

569
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,170
It's human nature to
question and be skeptical.

570
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,713
I'm sorry.

571
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,312
I didn't mean to cause...

572
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,681
We're depending on you, Brian. Hmm?

573
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,353
We need every detail.

574
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,933
I'm okay now.

575
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,648
Here you go.

576
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,084
It's okay.

577
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:36,204
She will need your strength
for what lies ahead.

578
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:38,506
What's that?

579
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,159
Isolate Evey.

580
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,495
Turn her off.

581
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,473
Hold still, just a
few more seconds.

582
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,576
Please try not to move.

583
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:33,420
Focus your eyes at
the ceiling, okay?

584
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:38,467
Stay relaxed. Stay
still, that's important.

585
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,391
She's ready.

586
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,355
Find Evey.

587
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,623
Don't move. Two,

588
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,958
three.

589
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:22,891
Photographs, Soviet technology.

590
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:26,531
Captures the bioelectric energy
fields around living organisms.

591
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:30,027
- Their aura?
- Their bioelectric energy fields.

592
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,484
These are Jane in a
neutral state of mind.

593
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:41,697
These, when she's
starting to manifest.

594
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:52,666
Evey.

595
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:56,215
It's ghastly.

596
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:59,469
So is this proof?

597
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:03,302
Using technology that
exists, cameraman,

598
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,346
it's the best we can do.

599
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,603
See what you've made, Jane?

600
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,865
You made her. You
can get rid of her.

601
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,865
I don't want to get rid of her.

602
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,035
You can't possibly mean that.

603
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:32,168
You can't.

604
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:38,921
Joseph.

605
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,678
It's okay.

606
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:46,182
He cares about us.

607
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,346
He does.

608
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:52,017
Joseph, I'm scared.

609
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,036
It means you're alive.

610
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:58,065
You'll be safe with someone
else, another family.

611
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,072
And I'll be sane.

612
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,753
I'm not fond of feeling scared.

613
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,219
Usually, I scare people.

614
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,012
I want to feel good.

615
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,397
Not tonight, Krissi.

616
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,270
We have to conserve our energy.

617
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,073
Go back to bed.

618
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,446
Go on.

619
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,337
What's wrong?

620
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,007
Nothing.

621
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,928
You've been distant all
week, something's up.

622
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:55,982
I just feel like we're
living on a spaceship.

623
00:58:56,742 --> 00:59:00,146
There's no TV, the
phones don't work.

624
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,579
I've stopped going to lectures,

625
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,027
I haven't read a newspaper in...

626
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,030
It's a prison.

627
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:11,372
It's a prison and we
are her prisoners.

628
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,549
This has gone on long enough.

629
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,134
What, you mean you and me?

630
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:18,334
No, you idiot! The Experiment.

631
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,639
Are both of you blind?

632
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,964
Joseph is in love with Jane Harper.

633
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
He's wants to cure her
so he can have her.
Don't be a child!
Piss off.

634
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,638
Krissi!

635
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,122
I had nothing to do with this,
I swear. I was asleep.

636
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,249
You couldn't have been
asleep. That's impossible.

637
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,542
She heard you laugh.

638
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,835
I don't control Evey.

639
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,003
You made Evey.

640
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:55,500
This is where your grand
hypothesis meets reality, Joseph.

641
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:59,637
What's the bloody plan? Hmm?
Do you even have one?

642
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:02,431
The plan's what it's always
been. Cure Jane Harper.

643
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,926
She tried to kill me!

644
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:09,688
Your tart tried to kill me.

645
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:13,844
Jesus, Joseph. Are you
screwing both of them?

646
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,028
Is that part of the Experiment?

647
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:19,273
You can go to hell, all of you.

648
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,773
Harry, go help her.

649
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,334
So, why couldn't she
have been sleeping?

650
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:35,115
Because that would mean she could
manifest whilst unconscious.

651
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,705
And that is, well,

652
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,208
unexpected.

653
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,135
I'm sorry, Harry.

654
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:00,231
You're all in love
with her, you know?

655
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,910
You, Joseph and Brian...
Brian most of all.

656
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,313
Come on, Krissi. Get real.

657
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You all think you can save her.

658
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:30,504
Power's out, just
checked the fuse box.

659
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,355
- Brian! Brian!
- Sir?

660
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,850
Bring the light. Jane's missing.

661
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,852
- What?
- Come on!

662
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,435
Where's she gone?

663
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,116
She's missing. If I knew
the answer to that,

664
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,144
she wouldn't be missing, would she?

665
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,280
What's that?

666
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:00,325
Help me!

667
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,961
- Jane!
- Jane!

668
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:06,297
Jane, where are you?

669
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,045
Jane?

670
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jane!
Open the door!

671
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,159
Be careful.

672
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:49,007
Krissi, go on. Slowly.

673
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,923
We don't know what's in here.

674
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:54,925
Sir, sir.

675
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,673
Jane?

676
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,149
Jane?

677
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,485
Shine the light,
goddamn it. I can't see.

678
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,263
- Jane?
- Jane!

679
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,598
Jane.

680
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,442
Jane.

681
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:20,621
- Where is she?
- Jane.

682
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:25,870
Odd, there's a toy.
What? Who's is it?

683
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It's like the painting, on
the wall in Jane's room.

684
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,187
You okay?

685
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,714
Goddamn it!

686
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:41,233
- Oh, God, Joseph.
- It's pitch black in here!

687
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,635
Sorry.

688
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,638
Jane!

689
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:51,565
- God, what is this?
- Jane? Jane?

690
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, my God, she's not here.
Can we please get out of here?
Go on.

691
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,006
Jesus! It's okay,
it's okay, I'm sorry.

692
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:06,175
- We need to stick together!
- I'm sorry.

693
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,577
Oh, God!

694
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:10,171
- Jane, please.
- Jane!

695
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:16,086
We understand this has been
difficult, but we're your family now!

696
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:20,006
What's that?

697
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:29,975
What are you doing?
Why are the lights off?

698
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:33,148
Where's Evey?

699
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,122
- What was that?
- What's that?

700
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,248
It's coming from there.

701
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:39,696
What was that?

702
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,874
She's right in front of you.

703
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,548
What's wrong, darling?

704
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,854
Why are you upset?

705
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,314
Get in close, go on.

706
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,558
You don't want to leave this house?

707
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:06,974
I understand.

708
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,148
Do you need me to hold you?

709
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
It's okay, love, I'm here.
Don't be afraid.

710
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,320
What's going on? Jane, Jane!

711
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,573
Put it out! Put it out quickly!

712
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,382
Oh, my God, what is that?

713
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:29,750
What is that?

714
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,428
What was that?

715
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,647
It's a sigil.

716
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:45,274
A what?

717
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,177
A sigil.

718
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,805
A sign of devil worship.

719
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:55,701
Which one of you idiots
put this into her mind?

720
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:59,163
Will you please just
consider the possibility

721
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:01,282
that Jane didn't create Evey?

722
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,709
Okay, that maybe Evey came from...

723
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,453
Somewhere else?

724
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:09,381
What came from somewhere else,

725
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:12,456
is the idea of the fucking occult

726
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,872
to a patient who is
highly suggestible!

727
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:18,208
So, I ask you again,

728
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,560
which one of you was it?

729
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:24,965
What if it didn't
come from any of us?

730
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:29,568
What if she's just a
vessel or a conduit?

731
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:31,570
She needs to go to the hospital.

732
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:34,656
Try to control your hysteria,
Kristina, it's beneath you.

733
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,326
- She's just expressing what she thinks...
- No one's asking you, Harry!

734
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,370
Don't talk to us like we're
children. We are colleagues.

735
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,247
Then think before you
speak, colleague.

736
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:45,822
With each paranormal event, we learn
more about how to eradicate it!

737
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:50,923
To probe like scientists,
not school girls.

738
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,966
That is so incredibly sexist.

739
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:55,260
Perhaps it doesn't fit
our hypothesis exactly.

740
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,346
Well, not if she's
possessed, it doesn't!

741
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,999
I can't be.

742
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,635
We made her, didn't we, Joseph?

743
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,516
And we can purge her.

744
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:14,181
You believe that with all
your heart, don't you?

745
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,784
We can stop this experiment
right now if you wish to.

746
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:20,186
No.

747
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,371
I don't want to hear another word

748
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:26,026
of this superstitious nonsense
uttered in this house again.

749
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:31,371
If any of you are too frightened,

750
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,541
well, you can leave.

751
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,790
I am too frightened.

752
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,206
We should go back to Oxford.

753
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:42,474
Salvage what's left of the term.

754
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:43,876
What about Jane?

755
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,311
I'm sorry.

756
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:49,306
We gave her a break,
now we need one.

757
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:02,027
Have you seen this sigil before?

758
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:06,290
Does it mean anything to you?

759
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,193
I can't remember.

760
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:11,237
Try, Jane, it's important.

761
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,827
Before I came here,

762
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:21,205
I was never comfortable
with who I was.

763
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:24,922
Have you ever felt like that?

764
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,436
You ever heard someone
call out your name,

765
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,680
but you couldn't recognize
it as your own?

766
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,357
Or looked at old
photographs of yourself,

767
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,601
but you couldn't
recognize your face?

768
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:39,439
I felt like that for as
long as I can remember.

769
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:48,361
Don't lose faith in Joseph,

770
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,867
or in Evey.

771
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:54,364
Or in me.

772
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:58,371
We need you.

773
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:07,893
For the first time in my life,

774
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:10,638
I think there's finally a
way for me to be happy.

775
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,967
Evey's making that happen.

776
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,893
- We can't.
- Why not?

777
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,032
Not yet.

778
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:23,408
Brian?

779
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,231
Not until you're well.

780
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:40,342
Do you think Evey will ever
leave Jane Harper alone?

781
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:42,086
Whatever Evey is.

782
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,164
Screw Evey.

783
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,442
Jane.

784
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:21,153
Jane.

785
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:25,287
I need to leave.

786
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:29,503
I'll be back as soon
as I can. Alright?

787
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:34,175
- Do you understand?
- Does she understand what?

788
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,177
I have to go to the film
lab, get more stock.

789
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:43,551
It might take me a while.

790
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:45,777
Oh.

791
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,350
Okay.

792
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:51,396
Take your time.

793
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,225
You.

794
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:37,230
You're the guy with the camera
working for Joseph Coupland.

795
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:44,571
Listen to you, nothing to say just like
everyone in Joseph's inner circle.

796
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:48,081
Tell me, have you already been
indoctrinated by the quiet ones?

797
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:50,592
You must have killed her by now.

798
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:54,088
You know, killing a young woman is
a wonderful way to create a ghost.

799
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:52,047
Harry! It's hot!

800
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Harry!

801
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,504
Krissi!

802
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:19,240
She needs to be locked
up in an asylum!

803
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,327
Sedated around the clock! Right?

804
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:23,870
When you leave a haunted house,

805
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,413
the spirit isn't
meant to follow you.

806
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,664
Keep it rational, Harry.

807
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,191
Rational?

808
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,410
- Now Evey's...
- Cameraman.

809
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:32,530
What took you so long?

810
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:38,877
They called themselves "Lilitu."

811
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:43,348
A cult, devoted to an ancient
demon worshipped by the Sumerians

812
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,683
5,000 years before Christianity.

813
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:47,256
Is this a joke?

814
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:49,521
Kristine nearly lost her life...

815
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,390
It's not a joke, it's Evey!

816
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:56,762
Evey?

817
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:59,231
Evey Dwyer.

818
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,826
As a child she exhibited
a gift for clairvoyance.

819
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:06,704
Their leader Dr. Heinrich
Dwyer became convinced

820
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:09,608
that Evey could
reincarnate their idol.

821
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:12,544
On June 6th, 1954,

822
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:15,588
Dr. Dwyer claimed that Evey
had received a message that

823
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:18,959
the Lilitu should lock
themselves inside this building.

824
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:24,166
A massive fire destroyed the building
that night, killing everyone inside.

825
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:26,625
Sir.

826
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,461
Sir.

827
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:33,932
Everyone including Evey Dwyer,

828
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:37,804
who was born with a
birthmark, a sigil.

829
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,031
Evey Dwyer for some reason is

830
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:44,367
a force that possesses Jane Harper.

831
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:45,815
Oh, my God.

832
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:49,982
Evey's gonna do to us what
she did to the Lilitu.

833
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:54,411
- She's a...
- A demonic spirit? Hmm?

834
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:57,714
Evil begetting evil
for the sake of evil

835
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:00,493
until the end of all times, ah?

836
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:03,712
Maybe even old Beelzebub himself.

837
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:07,056
Do any of these
seriously work for you?

838
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:08,308
They all work.

839
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:09,835
Or...

840
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:11,269
Or what?

841
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,672
The rational explanation.

842
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:16,191
That Jane somehow found
out about this cult.

843
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:17,442
When she was four?

844
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,902
She heard it at the
breakfast table,

845
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:20,361
her parents read it in a newspaper.

846
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,280
You make anything fit
into your hypothesis.

847
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:25,275
This only strengthens my
hypothesis actually, Harry.

848
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:28,286
When we ask Jane to go
deep she plucked the name

849
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:31,190
Evey Dwyer out of the deepest
recesses of her mind.

850
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:32,957
That is what she is manifesting,

851
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,709
that is what you call
her "possession!"

852
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:39,206
God, you're the one who's possessed,
Coupland, by your own bullshit!

853
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:44,628
Who is Evey Dwyer?

854
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,791
You know about her, don't you?

855
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,977
You found out about her or
somebody told you about her.

856
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:56,257
But you knew about her
before I found you.

857
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,393
Answer me!

858
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,069
Hey, hey, hey!

859
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,562
Speak, damn you!

860
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:05,266
Oh!

861
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:07,275
Brian!

862
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:10,578
Don't you touch her again.

863
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:12,606
But you will, won't you? Hmm?

864
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:15,041
Maybe you can screw
the truth out of her.

865
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,409
Whoa.

866
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:22,298
Krissi, Harry, stay or
leave, your choice.

867
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:25,635
You, cameraman or Lancelot,

868
01:19:25,636 --> 01:19:27,679
or whoever the hell
you think you are,

869
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,082
I want you and your
gear gone tonight.

870
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:34,716
The footage handed
over. Every frame.

871
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:07,748
What are we gonna do?

872
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:11,206
I'm leaving. I'm
taking Jane with me.

873
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,557
He'll never let you.

874
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:14,926
And even if he did, what then?

875
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:17,270
Find her help, professional help.

876
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:20,356
What kind of help? An exorcist?

877
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:23,886
She's not staying
here, not with him.

878
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:28,307
I need your help, I need
your car for starters.

879
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:34,484
Do you seriously believe that
Joseph still knows what he's doing?

880
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,954
It won't make a bit of difference.

881
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:16,913
<i>Get it out! Get it out!</i>

882
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:18,566
David!

883
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,861
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

884
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,414
<i>Tell him to leave me alone, Daddy!</i>

885
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:13,079
<i>I'm trying to find him,
Daddy. I can't find him.</i>

886
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:17,086
<i>I don't want to do
this anymore, Daddy.</i>

887
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:29,018
<i>I'm sorry, David.</i>

888
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:34,933
<i>I'm trying to help you.</i>

889
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,717
If only I had more time with him.

890
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:12,653
- If only she...
- David Q. was your son.

891
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:14,030
You deceived me!

892
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:18,106
No, Jane, try and understand.

893
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,746
I've dedicated my
entire life to this.

894
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:24,445
I'm absolutely certain
that I am correct.

895
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:30,573
I can cure you. Please,
I'm begging you.

896
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,584
Believe in me.

897
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:42,175
We believed in you, Joseph.

898
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,143
You bastard!

899
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:46,312
- You lied to us.
- You used me!

900
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:48,397
- I gave you everything!
- Don't you touch her!

901
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:52,268
Harry, stop! Harry,
Harry, Harry, stop it!

902
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:55,931
- Harry!
- What the fuck?

903
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:12,497
Jesus!

904
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Get out of here!
- Krissi, wait!

905
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:21,377
Krissi!

906
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,799
Harry!

907
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:30,507
Krissi!

908
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:34,512
Krissi! Krissi!

909
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,348
Krissi, open up! Krissi!

910
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:39,907
Krissi, hold on, I'm coming!

911
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:43,812
Krissi!

912
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,156
Krissi!

913
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:50,034
It's got me!

914
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,906
No, no, no!

915
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,262
Krissi...

916
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:39,742
Jane?

917
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:41,954
Jane?

918
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:49,294
She was the only survivor.

919
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,688
They must have kept it
out of the newspapers

920
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:55,467
so she'd have a chance
at a normal life.

921
01:25:57,194 --> 01:26:01,315
They changed her name.
A family took her in.

922
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:06,482
But the past became a bad dream
that lived in Evey like a virus.

923
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:12,113
It drove her mad, she
forgot everything.

924
01:26:25,097 --> 01:26:27,124
You're Evey Dwyer.

925
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:30,506
No wonder it's never leaving me.

926
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:34,631
The truth was always there
right in front of me.

927
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,342
I was born this way.

928
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:40,861
And that's how I'll die.

929
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,685
No, don't do that, don't...

930
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:46,951
All my life I felt there's
something burning inside of me.

931
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:48,869
Just let me help you.

932
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,455
I don't deserve to live.
I killed all those people.

933
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,624
Come with me. I can help you.

934
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,369
I can't be saved!

935
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:06,955
Jane, Jane!

936
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,999
I'm not Jane!

937
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:21,470
You okay?

938
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:25,098
Is she out?

939
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:27,400
I think so.

940
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:49,922
The patient we knew as Jane
Harper was born Evey Dwyer.

941
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:53,517
As a child she was indoctrinated
into an occult group

942
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:57,422
and made to believe she could
reincarnate their idol.

943
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:02,693
The damage that wrought
on her mind was severe.

944
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:05,696
The patient has expressed
on numerous occasions

945
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:08,449
a suicidal ideation, a death wish.

946
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,867
Joseph, you're gonna kill her!

947
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:14,774
Yes. But I'm going
to bring her back.

948
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:18,709
Ten cc's of adrenaline injected directly
into the heart should do the trick.

949
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,377
You're not gonna get
away with this.

950
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:24,123
Of course I'm not gonna get
away with it! Are you insane?

951
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:26,300
There are two dead
people in this house.

952
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,510
Untie, just untie...

953
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:28,958
Quiet!

954
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,922
You have a part to play in this.

955
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:35,669
You are the reason she's
going to want to come back.

956
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,923
- Jane, dear.
- Jane?

957
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,774
Can you hear me?

958
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:43,317
Jane!

959
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,470
Can you hear my voice?

960
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:47,571
Joseph...

961
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,815
Yes, dear, it's me.

962
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:53,437
I want you to release
Evey one last time.

963
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:55,855
- Joseph, leave her alone!
- Be quiet!

964
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:58,666
I will take photograms of
your bioelectric activity

965
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,835
as Evey leaves your body forever.

966
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:02,795
We will have scientific evidence.

967
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:04,994
It'll all be documented on film.

968
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:06,574
Jane!

969
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:12,471
All right, here we go.

970
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:13,873
Jane!

971
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:16,809
Joseph, don't you dare.

972
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:21,105
Joseph! Joseph! Joseph!

973
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,764
- Jane! Joseph!
- Shh!

974
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:31,057
Jane.

975
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:35,536
Just give her the shot,
Joseph! Get up!

976
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:41,750
Joseph, give her the adrenaline!

977
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:44,529
Aren't you just a little
bit curious? Hmm?

978
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:48,541
Please just give her
the adrenaline now.

979
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,051
Joseph, do it!

980
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:52,954
Not until Evey arrives.

981
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:40,001
Jane? Jane, just... What?

982
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:04,450
Jesus, Jane, come on!

983
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:11,241
Jane, Jane.

984
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:14,418
Jane, look at me. It's me.

985
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,678
Shh, shh.

986
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:34,738
Jane.

987
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,186
I'm sorry.

988
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:50,663
Jane. Jane.

989
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:53,082
Jane, open the door.

990
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:55,384
Jane...

991
01:31:55,385 --> 01:31:56,786
Jane!

992
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:00,422
Jane, open the door!

993
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

994
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:14,595
Jane!

995
01:32:15,113 --> 01:32:17,406
Open the door, Jane!

996
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:19,605
Jane, please don't!

997
01:32:19,909 --> 01:32:22,277
Jane, talk to me!

998
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jane! Jane!

999
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:50,548
<i>There was a fire.</i>

1000
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:55,311
How did they die, Brian?

1001
01:32:57,155 --> 01:32:59,057
It's in here.

1002
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:04,562
In here.

1003
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:07,039
It's in here.

1004
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,657
It's not in there.

1005
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:10,948
All the film's destroyed.

1006
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:18,747
You killed them, didn't you?

1007
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:27,715
Tell us what really happened.

1008
01:33:39,197 --> 01:33:40,644
What is that?
