1
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:20,098
Let's just take it from
the top, Mr. McCall.

2
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:28,815
Mr. McCall?

3
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:32,819
I told you, I didn't do it.

4
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:47,143
Good night.

5
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,312
Oh, fun for you.

6
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,671
See you tomorrow.

7
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:51,773
What?

8
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:54,859
Good night. We'll clean up.
I love you.

9
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Whoa! Shit! Maverick, stop.

10
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:57,547
Jesus Christ!

11
00:03:57,614 --> 00:04:00,591
- No, come on. Get off!
- You scared the shit out of me.

12
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,553
Go away. Come on, buddy. Get out.

13
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,763
You're not supposed
to see me tonight.

14
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,156
Come on, that is a dumb tradition.
You don't believe it.

15
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,269
- No, I don't believe it.
- Oh, shit, you do.

16
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:13,438
Okay, I kind of do.

17
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,005
What are you doing...

18
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:16,941
- Okay, ready?
- Okay.

19
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,902
Ladies, oop, and gentlemen...

20
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:22,596
I'd like to present the McCalls.

21
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:24,949
- Almost.
- Almost.

22
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:27,643
- Okay, I gotta get dressed.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.

23
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:30,580
Strike that pose. Right there.

24
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:33,791
I want to capture our
last night together.

25
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,293
We're not dying.

26
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:38,195
My dad used to follow us around
with one of these constantly.

27
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:40,497
My mom gave him so
much shit for it.

28
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,592
I think it's sweet.

29
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:45,053
I wish I had something like that.

30
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,472
My whole childhood
is kind of a blank.

31
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,318
That's kind of why
I want to do this.

32
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:51,583
I used to think my dad was so lame,

33
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:54,437
with all his nostalgia
and all that.

34
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:57,440
But I kind of get it now.

35
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:00,651
I kind of want this for us.

36
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:04,489
I just want a record of all the
important things that happen to us.

37
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,057
And all the random stupid stuff
that we'll forget about.

38
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:09,702
Mmm, yeah.

39
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:14,332
Tomorrow, we are officially family.

40
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,504
So, tonight I want to
start our family history.

41
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:22,799
Family history.

42
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:24,717
Yeah.

43
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,677
I love that.

44
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,679
Good.

45
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:44,428
In sickness and in health.

46
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:46,072
In sickness and in health.

47
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,098
To love and to cherish.

48
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:49,826
To love and to cherish.

49
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,102
Till death do us part.

50
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,330
Till death do us part.

51
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,940
With this ring, I thee wed.

52
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,835
With this ring, I thee wed.

53
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,278
And pledge myself to thee forever.

54
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,864
And pledge myself to thee forever.

55
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:10,263
<i>Love me tender</i>

56
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,832
<i>Love me true</i>

57
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:18,563
<i>All my dreams fulfilled</i>

58
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,922
Whoo!

59
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:25,695
<i>For, my darling, I love you</i>

60
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:31,409
I just wanted to say thank
you to Ken and Sally...

61
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:33,452
for making me feel so at home.

62
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,747
I've never really felt like
I was part of a family before.

63
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:43,504
So, thank you for being so
welcoming and wonderful.

64
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:46,073
Dad had the first camera.

65
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:48,259
He'd carry it on
his shoulder like this.

66
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:52,471
I wanted you to know that I think
you are a wonderful brother.

67
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:56,475
I'm being serious! This
is a beautiful event...

68
00:06:56,542 --> 00:07:00,438
and I'm really grateful
that you invited me.

69
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:03,858
We were in the same foster
home together for a year.

70
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:07,278
And we were more
than friends. Family.

71
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:09,780
I hope that you guys
will be happy forever.

72
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,491
So, here's to happily ever after.

73
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:15,161
Oh, gosh.

74
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,954
Mmm.

75
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:18,706
- Mmm.
- Are you okay?

76
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,018
Sam...

77
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,021
my beautiful wife.

78
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,400
This was the most perfect day.

79
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:50,363
I can't believe we're married.

80
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,327
When we watch this
a lot of years from now...

81
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:59,872
just remember how
good-looking I was.

82
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:06,379
I love you so much.

83
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:10,675
I promise I will
always protect you.

84
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,678
Keep you safe.

85
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:17,515
I love you.

86
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:20,309
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

87
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,062
<i>I'd like to welcome you
to the Dominican Republic.</i>

88
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,297
This is gonna be awesome.

89
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,289
- Now, the honeymoon begins.
- Ooh.

90
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,749
Oh, wow!

91
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:47,485
We're gonna do this
swimsuit issue-type thing.

92
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,570
Oh, God!

93
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,881
- No, no. You're gonna go in the water.
- Uh-huh.

94
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,467
And then you're gonna
come out of the water.

95
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,011
Is that how I'm gonna do it?

96
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,679
- Yeah.
- Okay.

97
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:00,599
Don't worry, I'm right behind you.

98
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,201
- This is gonna go fast.
- No, it's not.

99
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,854
Oh, my God.

100
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,276
Christopher Columbus.

101
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:11,635
- Oh. Really?
- Yeah.

102
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:15,323
This is the first cathedral
in the New World.

103
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,284
"The Cathedral of Santo Domingo."

104
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:23,956
"It's Gothic style highlighted
with Renaissance details."

105
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:25,649
Oh, my God.

106
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,963
I have never seen anything so
fucking perfect before in my life.

107
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,616
Look at this sea of white.
Oh, my gosh.

108
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,762
What's that?

109
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
That's my husband.
Wake up.
Hey.

110
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,859
<i>Oogum, Oogum, Boogum,
Boogum, Boogum...</i>

111
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:54,779
<i>Now, baby you're casting
your spell on me</i>

112
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:58,949
<i>Your high heel boots
In your hip-huggin' suit</i>

113
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:02,119
<i>You got it right
You're outta sight</i>

114
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,371
What is that?

115
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,021
It's the coolest
wedding present ever.

116
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,333
Mason gave it to us.
It's an adventure cam.

117
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:09,794
- Oh, good, that's what I always wanted.
- I know.

118
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,962
And now we can go
zip-lining. Come on.

119
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,632
Just get your game face on.

120
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,117
All right.

121
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:19,136
Hold on. Hold on!

122
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:29,355
Wow.

123
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,404
Where are we?

124
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,537
Zach, come here.

125
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,334
We're going here.

126
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,588
Whoa. Come on.

127
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:56,424
Hey, wait up, wait up.

128
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,386
- Welcome.
- Oh, thank you.

129
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:03,222
- Hi.
- Welcome.

130
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,225
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

131
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,686
I will study your palm.

132
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:10,378
Okay. Which one do you want?

133
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,814
This one.

134
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:14,090
I don't think it matters.

135
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,277
I don't know. They're different.

136
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:24,201
You've had some hard times.

137
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:27,872
But now, you're so happy.

138
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,191
- You're happy now.
- She's good.

139
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,050
No family.

140
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,055
No past.

141
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:00,112
You were born from death.

142
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,491
What do you mean?

143
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,118
They've been waiting.

144
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,286
- Do you want to go?
- Yeah.

145
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,448
- They've been waiting.
- Whoa.

146
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,124
- They've been waiting.
- All right.

147
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,292
Thank you. That's fine.

148
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,919
- Whoa.
- They've been waiting.

149
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,505
You are the first.
The first of many.

150
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:19,173
You will bring the end.

151
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,759
You know what? Let's go, let's go.

152
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:22,867
Can we get out...

153
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,160
- Ow! Ow!
- You were born from death.

154
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,638
- Let go of me, please.
- Ma'am, let go.

155
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,348
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

156
00:12:27,415 --> 00:12:29,517
- Zach, come on.
- Okay.

157
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,604
Hey, are you okay?
What did she say to you?

158
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:36,548
- Nothing. Fucking nothing. I don't know.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

159
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,319
Hey. Forget her, okay?
She was crazy.

160
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:41,820
What did she whisper in your ear?

161
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,448
I don't know. It was just
a bunch of gibberish.

162
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,326
She stank of rum anyway. I just
want to get back to the hotel.

163
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,829
I don't remember
this street, do you?

164
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,165
Do you wanna go down this way?

165
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,293
Let's turn around.

166
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:00,965
Okay.

167
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,262
Jesus!

168
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:10,766
Let's go.

169
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:18,423
They don't have any street signs.

170
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,717
Can we head back towards
where the party was?

171
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,154
Do you guys need a taxi?

172
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,323
- Are you are a taxi?
- Yeah.

173
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:28,826
- That's your family?
<i>- Mi</i> family. Children. Babies.

174
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:32,329
- Babies?
- Oh, no, not yet.

175
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:35,323
- No?
- My new wife.

176
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:39,403
I have lots of babies.

177
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:41,839
- Yes, lots of babies.
- Someday. One day, yeah.

178
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:46,050
I take you somewhere fun.
Eh... Fun, authentic.

179
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,470
No, no, no. We're good. Thank you.

180
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,556
We just want to go
back to the hotel.

181
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:52,582
No, no, no. No worry.

182
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:57,754
I'll wait for you outside. This place,
eh... Very distinctive. How do you say?

183
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:58,838
It's special.

184
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,120
- What do you think? One more drink?
- No.

185
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,110
Come on. You're so young.

186
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:06,198
- Twenty minutes.
- Twenty minutes.

187
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:08,198
Twenty minutes?

188
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,059
Twenty minutes.
It's our last night.

189
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,120
- Twenty minutes?
- How much does it cost?

190
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,110
Oh, it's free, it's free.
Are you guys with me?

191
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,944
- Deal.
- All right, fine. One drink.

192
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:24,113
This is it. We here.

193
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,717
- We're here.
- Yeah. This looks...

194
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,451
Great.

195
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,036
Oh. Okay.

196
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,388
Your vacation starts right now.

197
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,557
Okay, gracias.

198
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,518
You're welcome.
Come on. It's this way.

199
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:39,563
- You don't look happy.
- Well, where are we?

200
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,410
I don't know, but
it's gonna be cool.

201
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,088
- Careful.
- Right. Okay.

202
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,571
Oh!

203
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:50,165
- Look at this little guy.
- Hi, little guy.

204
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,160
Whoo.

205
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,204
Ooh!

206
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,081
I'm right here.

207
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:58,565
Shh.

208
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:01,943
The music.

209
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,380
- You hear music?
- Yeah.

210
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,756
It's musica.

211
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:07,466
Yeah, I hear it.

212
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:08,801
Wait, this is...

213
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,744
No, Zach, let's go back. This
is crazy. Let's turn around.

214
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,204
Don't worry. Don't worry.

215
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,099
We'll be all right. I'm
right here, I'm right here.

216
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,101
All right, I'm right here.

217
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,348
- Don't...
- We'll go slow.

218
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,651
I'm sorry, what?

219
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,643
Oh, wow. Okay.

220
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,457
It's fine, I promise.

221
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,919
- See?
- Go on. Go on.

222
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:53,137
Excuse me. Excuse me.

223
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,503
It's special!

224
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,942
This is insane!

225
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:13,196
Authentic Santo Domingo. Come on

226
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,326
Oh, see how great. Here we go.

227
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:17,619
Cheers!

228
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:21,623
Yes! Beautiful!

229
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,399
- Here we go.
- Ah!

230
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,840
- I'm gonna hold my nose.
- Ah!

231
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,070
That's not how you take
a shot. You sipped it.

232
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:28,112
No!

233
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,353
You gotta do another. One more.

234
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,884
Oh, my God! Congratulations!

235
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,076
Oh, thank you!

236
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,012
- They just got married, too.
- No way!

237
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:38,140
Yes!

238
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,349
I'm done.

239
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,518
Oh, yes!

240
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,020
Oh.

241
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,526
These men are staring at me.

242
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,593
What?

243
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:53,429
I said, "These men
are staring at me."

244
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,868
I guess you'll do.

245
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,245
I can't dance anymore.

246
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:02,623
Hi!

247
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:04,875
Hi!

248
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:08,128
Hey, babe, let's put it away.

249
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,307
<i>- Yes?
- Yes</i>

250
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

251
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,621
Come on, wife.

252
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,123
Time to get up.

253
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,541
- Come on.
- No.

254
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,860
Yes. I'm sorry, but
we gotta get up.

255
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,130
Ugh.

256
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,965
I'm so hung over.

257
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,967
Yeah, no kidding.

258
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,679
Mmm, oh, God, get away with that.

259
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:42,079
Come on, I'll get you some water.

260
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,620
We gotta get up and
catch this plane.

261
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,058
Okay.

262
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,603
Oh.

263
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,921
Yeah, my head is killing me.

264
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,315
Me, too.

265
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:54,026
Oh, shit. I'm stuck.

266
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,486
Mmm.

267
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,031
How did we get home last night?

268
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,717
I don't know. The guy in the cab?

269
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:03,827
Stop. Not right now.

270
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,874
See you later, Santo Domingo.

271
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,711
- Well, we're home.
- Mmm.

272
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,838
Home sweet home.

273
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,740
The honeymoon is over.

274
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,593
Ooh, wait, wait, wait.

275
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,178
- Hold this.
- Oh.

276
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,971
- Oh, sorry.
- Yeah.

277
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,550
- Okay, here we go.
- All right.

278
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,228
Welcome home, Mrs. McCall.

279
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:33,440
Ugh.

280
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,608
Oh.

281
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,693
- Suzie left the door open.
- Great.

282
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,320
That's great.

283
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,197
Oh.

284
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:42,074
Yay, home.

285
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,409
Ooh, presents.

286
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,702
Crate and Barrel, Crate and Barrel.

287
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:46,950
I'll go get the bags.

288
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:50,248
All right. We got the panini grill.

289
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:53,251
And that thing from Allison.

290
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,528
And what is this one?

291
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:56,990
Oh, I don't know. Open it up.

292
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,966
Mav, do you want to open it?

293
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,385
- All right. OK.
- He doesn't care.

294
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:06,723
This is the juicer that I wanted!

295
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:11,603
I'm gonna make so much stuff
with flax and probiotics...

296
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,147
and things with kale.

297
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,984
- Kale?
- Mmm.

298
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,052
Kale... kale.

299
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,407
Oh, Mav!

300
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,492
Oh, my God.

301
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,744
- Look at him.
- Oh!

302
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,164
Hey, did you see the "Sold"
sign on the Anderson house?

303
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,292
For real? Maybe someone will
finally fix that place up.

304
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,961
I hope so. It's terrible.

305
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:38,255
Your husband, he can't
grill for shit.

306
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:40,239
Sam, come on. You're gonna miss it.

307
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,093
This will be awesome. Ready?
Just like we practiced.

308
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,637
Are you kidding me? Come on,
Maverick. No, no, no.

309
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,264
You're supposed to catch it.

310
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:48,932
- Zach.
- Yeah?

311
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,268
Come on, ready? Eye on the prize.

312
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,103
Yes, yes, yes!

313
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,604
- Zach.
- What?

314
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:58,358
Can you turn that
off for one second?

315
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:00,509
Whoa.

316
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,612
What is that?

317
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,034
Uh...

318
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,621
It doesn't make any sense.

319
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,899
I've taken the pill religiously.
I've never missed one ever.

320
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,376
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

321
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,464
You're pregnant?

322
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,468
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

323
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,763
We're having a baby.

324
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,806
Holy shit!

325
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,810
Oh, my God. That's so amazing.

326
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,972
I feel good about this
office. How about you?

327
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:42,819
I feel good. Except that says three stages
of pregnancy, and there's four pictures.

328
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:46,698
Okay, so this isn't a math office.
It's a doctor's office.

329
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,825
I hope that doctors can do math.

330
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,286
Well, the doctor didn't
make that sign, clearly.

331
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,353
Do you think the doctor made
the "Dirty Area" sign?

332
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,832
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

333
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,668
Mr. and Mrs. McCall.
Hello, how are you?

334
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:01,004
- I'm Zach.
- I am Dr. Ludka.

335
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,965
Nice to finally meet. Yes.

336
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,967
- Hello, lucky lady.
- Hi.

337
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,910
- How are you doing?
- I'm good, how are you?

338
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,495
Okay. You ready?

339
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:10,830
Yeah.

340
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,641
Okay, this is gonna
be quick and painless.

341
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:13,809
Awesome.

342
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,644
- Sorry.
- "Awesome."

343
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:18,796
You know you get a copy
of the ultrasound, right?

344
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,524
Oh, yeah, I just, um...

345
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,025
This is his thing.

346
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,568
- It's our thing.
- It's our thing.

347
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:27,697
We just want to film a bunch of this
so he/she, whoever, can see it later.

348
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,658
- It's for the baby.
- Okay, sure.

349
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,868
- Is it okay?
- Oh, yeah, perfect.

350
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,079
Okay. Make sure you
get my good side.

351
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:36,414
- Done. Right there.
- Both sides.

352
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,834
This is gonna be a little cold.

353
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:42,629
Mmm-hmm.

354
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,589
- A little gooey, huh?
- Yeah. Oh!

355
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:48,718
- That's great.
- Okay.

356
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:51,721
- Ah, there we go.
- Oh.

357
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:55,600
Can you see? There's your
uterus, right there.

358
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,062
And there's the heartbeat.

359
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,402
Huh, um...

360
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:06,635
What?

361
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:09,114
Oh, don't worry, I'm just
gonna make a few adjustments.

362
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:10,615
Is it okay?

363
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,285
Uh...

364
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:17,205
Ah, there we go.

365
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,815
- So, you're about seven weeks along.
- Ooh.

366
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,751
And everything looks really good.

367
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,378
Honeymoon baby.

368
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:29,092
The pill is about 99 percent effective,
but, occasionally, this happens.

369
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:30,743
Okay.

370
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:32,328
- She winked at me.
- I saw that.

371
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,347
Because I got good sperm.

372
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,624
- This is what you started.
- What? It's good, strong sperm.

373
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:40,061
I'm gonna prescribe vitamin B...

374
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,939
- and iron, since you're a vegetarian.
- Mmm-hmm.

375
00:23:42,982 --> 00:23:44,965
Yeah, I've been trying
to break her of that.

376
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:46,443
- It's for the baby.
- Mmm-hmm.

377
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,405
But, overall, you're pretty healthy. I'm
expecting a pretty smooth ride, here.

378
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:51,907
- Awesome.
- Great.

379
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:53,450
- Okay?
- Thank you.

380
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:55,202
One more thing.

381
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,686
Ooh.

382
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,372
Congratulations.

383
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,625
The due date is March 30th.

384
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,127
- Hey, he looks like you.
- He doesn't!

385
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:05,712
A little jelly bean.

386
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,466
- Ooh, Will you hold this?
- Oh, sure.

387
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:14,471
- It's our first family video.
- Oh, sweet.

388
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:16,973
That's awesome.

389
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,642
Sorry. Thanks.

390
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,796
All right, I expect you
guys back in five weeks.

391
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:26,799
I think Maverick drank my wine.

392
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:31,821
Aw, Mav, he's such a lush.

393
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:36,826
Hey, have your ankles and
toes started swelling up?

394
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:40,664
Oh, my God, with the ankles.
Yes, they're swelling up.

395
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,625
I read in the baby book, it says
that those things swell sometimes.

396
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:47,796
They do. My entire thing
is swelling right now.

397
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:51,240
It looks good. You could use
a little meat on your bones.

398
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,760
Mmm-mmm. I don't like it.

399
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:58,014
- Hey, ew. I mean, whoa.
- What? Oh, God.

400
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:01,333
- You haven't noticed that?
- No, what is that?

401
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,418
- Oh.
- Does it hurt?

402
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:05,838
No, I think my body is being
taken over by hormones.

403
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,526
Ugh, this is not supposed to be
happening yet. Don't look at that.

404
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:11,361
All these weird things
are gonna happen to you.

405
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:16,283
You're making a person
inside of your person.

406
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,994
Seriously, that's amazing.

407
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,870
- Sam.
- Mmm?

408
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:24,708
You're making a baby.
I can't do that.

409
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,042
Yeah.

410
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,617
Mmm.

411
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:38,888
Oh, she woke you up?

412
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:43,226
Yeah. So, your mother snores.

413
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:46,563
Even though she
categorically denies it.

414
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
But we now have hard evidence.
So, if she ever denies it again...
Oh, hey. Sam.
Sam, hey.

415
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,410
Jesus, Sam.

416
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,245
Sam.

417
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,539
Hey.

418
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,419
Go to sleep.

419
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:14,531
What are you doing?

420
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:15,759
Hello.

421
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:20,847
They're getting restless.
So, I'll leave it to Sam.

422
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:22,932
We're having a baby.

423
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,435
Oh, my God!

424
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,358
What?

425
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,735
We get to be grandparents again.

426
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:36,905
Stop.

427
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:38,281
Congratulations.

428
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:41,951
Flip it. Flip that card that
you just had in your hand.

429
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:45,688
Thank you. Seven,
king, so I get it.

430
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,959
- Tofu?
- What did you think it was?

431
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,920
I wish you wouldn't have
told me it was tofu.

432
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,465
- I mean, did they do a sonogram?
- Oh, yeah.

433
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,467
Did you get a picture?

434
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:01,096
She wants a picture to show
everybody immediately.

435
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:02,472
Oh, ultrasound.

436
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:05,517
If you go with a C-section, your
body just bounces right back.

437
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:06,893
- Great.
- What?

438
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,773
Natalie, why don't you try to not
micro-manage their entire thing?

439
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,274
I checked under the fridge.
It's not there.

440
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:16,260
- You lifted the fridge up?
- I looked under it.

441
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:17,386
We'll find it.

442
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,864
I couldn't find it. When I
do, I'll email it to you.

443
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:21,307
I hope you find it.

444
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:22,617
We Will.

445
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:25,102
I'm just gonna be on
pins and needles to see it.

446
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:28,123
Oh, my God, Sam, you're bleeding.

447
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:30,208
- Oh, God.
- Oh, jeez, here.

448
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:31,960
Sam, here you go. This is clean.

449
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,378
Tilt your head back.

450
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:38,341
This is where you'll go to school.

451
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,594
I got beat up here a couple times,
but that's not gonna happen to you.

452
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,454
You're gonna be a much cooler kid.

453
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:47,016
Ah, this is where me and
your mom got married.

454
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,394
Very pretty church.

455
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,897
This is where we walk the dog.

456
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:57,569
Here's the Anderson house.
It still looks like shit.

457
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,446
Shit, fuck. Maverick!

458
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,739
Maverick, God damn.

459
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,993
Hey, hey. Maverick!

460
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,787
Come here. Hey, no, no.

461
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,688
No, no, we don't live here.
Come on.

462
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:12,375
All right, come on.

463
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:14,401
Come on.

464
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:16,463
This is your house.

465
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,549
That's your room up
there on the left.

466
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,677
Your granddad says
that it's a money pit...

467
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:26,514
but it's got good bones. Shit.

468
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:28,057
- Hey.
- Hey.

469
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:30,435
Do you think this
looks too mish-mash?

470
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,895
Um...

471
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,189
Do you want the truth?

472
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,907
I'm giving our baby a
tour of the house.

473
00:28:36,908 --> 00:28:40,111
- Yeah? Hey, that's not the house.
- Sorry.

474
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:43,865
And the grand finale, your room.

475
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:46,975
Formerly known as
your mother's office.

476
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,852
But now we are converting.

477
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,331
- Thank you for giving up your office.
- Mmm-hmm. Whoa!

478
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,750
- Jeez.
- Watch it, there.

479
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:58,463
I study on the couch all the time,
anyway, so it's not a big deal.

480
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,905
It's a pretty good room, though.

481
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:04,093
She really didn't do anything in
it, so I think it's only fair.

482
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,888
It's gonna be kind of cool, though.
You and I are gonna hang in here.

483
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,097
Hey.

484
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,393
- Do you see this guy across the street?
- Huh?

485
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,396
He's just staring up at the house.

486
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:19,317
- What the fuck?
- Oh, it's creepy.

487
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,361
- Hey.
- Hi.

488
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:22,695
- How was class?
- Ow!

489
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:26,866
Ugh. It was fine. I just had
to leave because I'm starving.

490
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:29,452
I think there's some
leftover Pad Thai in there.

491
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,287
I know, I don't want that.

492
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:32,938
Okay.

493
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:34,999
Um...

494
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:37,460
I'm just gonna eat a
bunch of cookies.

495
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,755
How are you feeling?

496
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,258
Fine.

497
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:44,968
I'm just hungry.

498
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:25,151
All right. Whoo! Get ready.

499
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,570
- Hey, no!
- Oh!

500
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:29,322
- What?
- Hello?

501
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,760
I told you that this was off-limits
until I told you that it was on-limits.

502
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,268
But it's just Emily,
I want her to see it.

503
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:35,411
It looks so good.

504
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:37,274
I don't care about
Emily, I care about you.

505
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,666
- Okay. Thanks.
- Great.

506
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,584
Are you guys gonna
pick a color or...?

507
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:44,212
- One of these days.
- This looks really good, though.

508
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,382
- Oh, look! Oh, my God.
- Yep.

509
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:49,092
- That's really nice.
- You made that?

510
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:50,534
It's gonna look way better.

511
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:52,661
You're doing a great job.
I'm very proud of you.

512
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:56,808
- Well, here's the crib.
- Uh-huh.

513
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:58,792
- Hey!
- Oh, wow.

514
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,269
That looks really good.

515
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:03,314
Yeah, we got it at the antique place
and then I brought it home...

516
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:07,902
and sanded it down and refinished
it and stuff. Made it baby-safe.

517
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:10,655
- I know you're big on baby safety.
- Yeah, it looks great.

518
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:12,347
Cute sheets.

519
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:13,449
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

520
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:16,285
- I got you. Okay.
- Ah!

521
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:18,621
I got you. Sit down.

522
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:20,957
Are you okay?

523
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:22,625
It happened this morning, too.

524
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:24,961
- This bad?
- Mmm-hmm.

525
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:28,506
- Hey. Just breathe, okay?
- Mmm.

526
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:30,633
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

527
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,825
Lie down, maybe?

528
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:32,969
Are you sure?

529
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,304
I'll just sit here for a sec.

530
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,349
In...

531
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,477
and out.

532
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:45,481
In...

533
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:52,613
Do you see what I'm doing for you?
I'm learning how to breathe.

534
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:59,495
You might actually have to
know some of this stuff.

535
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:01,438
I know this stuff.
I know how to breathe.

536
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:05,376
Okay. I know that you know how to
breathe, but there's other stuff.

537
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:07,170
Okay.

538
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:08,504
Stop!

539
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,718
You are strong. You are healthy.

540
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:19,223
Your body is going through
a beautiful transformation.

541
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:22,018
That's a load of shit.

542
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:27,190
I want you all to imagine a
place that's calming, quiet.

543
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:30,818
Make it a specific memory.

544
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:33,321
Where are you?

545
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:35,740
On the beach on our honeymoon.

546
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:39,368
How old are you?

547
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:43,873
Are you alone?

548
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,045
Breathe into this memory
that brings you joy.

549
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:53,883
Okay, everyone, please breathe.

550
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,886
If you're gonna sit up,
sit up slowly.

551
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:00,848
Very slowly. Keep
breathing, everyone.

552
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:02,725
Please remain calm.

553
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,352
Sam. Are you okay?

554
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,104
- So, this is happening.
- Yep.

555
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:09,065
We are buying baby stuff.

556
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:11,609
Baby stuff!

557
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,178
- Let's go crazy.
- Yeah, let's go nuts.

558
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,739
Ooh! Uh...

559
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,785
Do you want to practice a little diapering?
Get a little wrap around this guy?

560
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:23,496
- I'm good.
- You don't want to do that?

561
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:25,790
He's not even in a box.
He's clearly dirty.

562
00:34:25,857 --> 00:34:28,835
Yeah, where'd this baby come from?
I don't know you, baby.

563
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:31,653
You bent him over, looked at his
ass to see where it came from.

564
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:34,257
I just wanted to know if he
had a name or something.

565
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:36,366
Ah...

566
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:37,635
It's a milk pump!

567
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,762
Not at all.

568
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,097
- No?
- No.

569
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,631
- We need one though, right?
- Yeah, we do actually need one.

570
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:46,185
I never want to see you
do that ever again.

571
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,108
Probably not.

572
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:55,653
No, I think we got everything. This
is all a baby needs, right here.

573
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,262
Ow!

574
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:58,948
Are you all right?

575
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:01,516
I'm gonna go get the car,
all right? Just hold on.

576
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:02,618
No, I'm fine.

577
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:05,621
No, seriously, Sam.
Please, just wait there.

578
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:07,707
I'll be right there.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

579
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,293
Oh, shit! Sam!

580
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:11,502
Motherfucker!

581
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:14,672
What are you doing?
Are you fucking crazy?

582
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:16,419
- Get away from my car!
- Stop, stop!

583
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:23,139
It's okay. It's okay.

584
00:35:24,907 --> 00:35:27,250
We're gonna get some help.
We're gonna get some help.

585
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:29,312
It's all right, it's all
right, it's all right.

586
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,147
What happened? What happened?

587
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:34,317
Breathe. Just breathe.
Just breathe, just breathe.

588
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:36,652
What is wrong with me?

589
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,779
Something is wrong!

590
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:42,325
Hey.

591
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,995
You look really pretty
when you're pensive.

592
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:48,080
I'm serious.

593
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:49,582
Hey...

594
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:54,069
Look what I found behind your ear.

595
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,546
Nothing.

596
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,383
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

597
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,344
Hi, Samantha. I'm Dr. Dylan.

598
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,346
Where's Dr. Ludka?

599
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:07,099
Dr. Ludka had to take a leave
of absence. I'm covering for her.

600
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,851
Well...

601
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:12,063
Excuse me. Is she gonna
be back anytime soon?

602
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:15,733
She filled me in, and
I've studied your file.

603
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:20,011
Well, will she be back
by the time we deliver?

604
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,864
Yeah, can we talk to her?

605
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:26,035
I don't think she's gonna be able to come
back. Let's talk about your symptoms.

606
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:27,578
Oh.

607
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:30,373
Okay.

608
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,500
Huh.

609
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:35,920
The baby looks healthy.

610
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:38,780
But it's turned around.

611
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:42,468
We're not gonna be able to find
out if it's a boy or girl today.

612
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:44,575
- It's gotten so much bigger.
- Mmm.

613
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:48,724
Sam, are you okay?

614
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:04,949
She just needs a minute.

615
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:07,702
Sorry, the nausea hasn't
really gotten better.

616
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:10,246
It actually seems like
it's gotten kind of worse.

617
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:13,874
Well, it's not entirely unusual.

618
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:16,002
Um...

619
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:19,797
She's been getting nosebleeds,
too. Are those...?

620
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:22,008
Yeah, it can be.

621
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:25,845
She just doesn't seem
like herself lately.

622
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:29,140
Is there a history of mental
illness in her family?

623
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:31,684
Uh, I don't know.

624
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:37,231
She took some meds during
college for anxiety.

625
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:39,942
I don't really know what they were.

626
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:41,777
Um...

627
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:45,281
We don't really know
anything about her family.

628
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:49,326
Her parents were killed in a car crash
and they had to cut Sam out of her womb.

629
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:51,811
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

630
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:54,248
Hey.

631
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:56,929
You look beautiful.

632
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,961
I'm really sorry.

633
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:01,068
- It's all right.
- It's all right.

634
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:07,386
I'm gonna do an amnio now,
just to rule out any issues.

635
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:10,723
Especially since you don't know
what may run in your family.

636
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,891
Okay.

637
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:15,269
- Are you all right?
- Mmm.

638
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:18,105
Okay. Good.

639
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:19,940
I'm good, too.

640
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:21,817
Good. I was worried about you.

641
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:23,984
I know. I could tell,
because you asked.

642
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:25,613
Uh, is this gonna hurt?

643
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,991
Oh, it's just a little pressure.
It'll be over before you know it.

644
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:34,371
I need you to stay very still.
Nurse, watch the monitor, please.

645
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:36,999
- Mmm-hmm.
- Are you ready?

646
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,835
Just relax. Take a deep breath.

647
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,464
Mmm.

648
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:44,948
Mmm-mmm.

649
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:46,425
Are you okay?

650
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:48,844
- No.
- It's okay.

651
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:51,722
Something's wrong. Can you
get it out? Can you get it out?

652
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:52,890
- Keep her still.
- Is everything okay?

653
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:55,392
- No, no. Mmm-mmm.
- Just try to stay still.

654
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:57,539
- Samantha, we're almost there.
- Can you get it out?

655
00:38:57,545 --> 00:39:00,064
Can you get it out?
Please, get it out!

656
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:01,941
You're gonna hurt
yourself. Sam, please.

657
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:03,442
Get it out!

658
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:05,569
Can you get it out
of her? Thank you.

659
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:08,697
It's out. It's done, it's done.

660
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:11,075
Hey, hey. It's done.

661
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:13,994
It's okay. All right?

662
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:16,539
It's okay.

663
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:20,501
I can't do this. I can't do this.

664
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:22,545
It's all right.

665
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:25,714
I'm really worried about her.
I don't know what to do.

666
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:27,925
Do you think she'd ever
actually hurt herself?

667
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:29,343
What?

668
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:32,972
No. I don't know, I don't think so.

669
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:36,767
Just to be safe, we'll be
keeping a close eye on her.

670
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,519
Okay.

671
00:40:38,062 --> 00:40:39,663
I'm gonna fix this door someday.

672
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,540
Yeah, that'll be great.

673
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:44,043
- Watch your step.
- Okay, thank you.

674
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:48,172
I'm so glad my sister
bought me that flashlight.

675
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:56,931
How are you doing?

676
00:40:56,997 --> 00:41:00,875
I feel like a hot air balloon.

677
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,479
- You're going upstairs?
- Mmm-hmm.

678
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:05,314
- I'm gonna go take a bath.
- Okay.

679
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:06,690
I'm just gonna check
the score on the game.

680
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:08,567
All right.

681
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:15,574
This thing takes
forever to turn on.

682
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,629
We need to get a fucking maid.

683
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

684
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:17,594
Oh, look.

685
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:19,930
That's beautiful.

686
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:22,182
Wow. Nice.

687
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:30,566
Do you want to take off while
we wait for the results?

688
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:36,697
Go to a spa, or...
Let's just get out of town.

689
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:43,579
- It's a good idea.
- Yeah.

690
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:48,625
I'm just thinking, though, you've
already taken so much time off of work.

691
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:53,797
And I've got finals and we should probably
be close to the doctor right now.

692
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:59,053
All right. It's just a thought.

693
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,138
It's a good thought.

694
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:05,851
I'm gonna be all right.

695
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:08,395
I know.

696
00:43:19,807 --> 00:43:21,533
One second. Okay.

697
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:24,661
Surprise!

698
00:43:30,939 --> 00:43:33,629
- Happy birthday, darling.
- Wow, thank you.

699
00:43:33,696 --> 00:43:34,922
Great, son. How are you?

700
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:37,841
I'm very well, thank you. Hi, Ma.

701
00:43:38,242 --> 00:43:41,303
- Happy birthday, Aunt Sam.
- Oh, my gosh.

702
00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:44,139
Happy birthday!

703
00:43:44,373 --> 00:43:46,809
No, I'm fine, I just gotta rest.

704
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:47,976
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

705
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:49,127
Why are you guys
hiding in the corner?

706
00:43:49,128 --> 00:43:50,229
Hey.

707
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:52,088
Looking good!

708
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:53,565
- Thank you.
- Um...

709
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:56,009
She's just gonna go upstairs
for a little bit, take a rest.

710
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,694
I gotta lie down. I'll be back.

711
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,554
I'll come up in a little
bit and check on you.

712
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:01,281
I just need a few minutes.

713
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:05,702
- I'll clean all this up.
- No, I got it, I got it.

714
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:07,913
I'm gonna help you, too.
It's fine, I got it.

715
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,791
You guys got everyone here,
I'll clean it all up.

716
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:12,084
It's no problem. That's
what friends are for.

717
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:14,253
- Can I have some cake?
- Yeah, here you go.

718
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,754
- Is this too big a bite?
- No.

719
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:18,424
Oh, that's cute.

720
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,551
- We're the sweetest.
- We're so cute.

721
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,636
How's Sam?

722
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:26,849
I don't know, I haven't been
up there since she went up.

723
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:32,054
Honestly, in general,
she has not been herself.

724
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:36,567
The doctor says that everything is
fine, and we've done all these tests.

725
00:44:37,265 --> 00:44:39,969
But she's just convinced that there's
something wrong with the baby.

726
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,780
- She's adamant about it.
- Wow.

727
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:46,577
Braedon.

728
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:49,621
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

729
00:44:52,483 --> 00:44:54,501
Braedon?

730
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Come on, I know you're in here.

731
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:09,391
Braedon.

732
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:22,905
Braedon?

733
00:45:29,645 --> 00:45:33,165
Braedon, come out.
It's not funny anymore.

734
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Braedon.

735
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:55,354
Get out!

736
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:19,211
I think I just saw you move.

737
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:23,048
All right, come on. Do it again.

738
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:26,677
Lift this back so we can see you.

739
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:29,388
All right, buddy, let's go.

740
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:32,266
Ah.

741
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:36,478
You're sleeping like
your lazy mother.

742
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:40,691
Lazy bones.

743
00:46:42,134 --> 00:46:44,152
It's all right.

744
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:47,656
Shh.

745
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:57,332
Mav, hey. Hey.

746
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:22,399
You know, we talked about
the summer courses.

747
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:25,986
So, I figured I'd just get a
couple of classes going...

748
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:29,323
and then go back to the
full load in the fall.

749
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:31,867
You don't want to just
wait until the fall?

750
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,872
No, I don't want to just
wait until the fall.

751
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:43,819
Okay, I was just
thinking because...

752
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,882
I know, it's just that
this has come up and I...

753
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:49,283
No, I know. But the baby
is coming in March.

754
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:53,555
I know it's not gonna be easy. But I don't
want to put everything on hold just to...

755
00:47:53,622 --> 00:47:56,725
We're not putting everything
on hold indefinitely.

756
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:59,895
- I gotta keep working.
- But if I stop doing it now...

757
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:03,273
then I feel like I'm not gonna
be able to start back up again.

758
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,882
I'm gonna be stuck in this house

759
00:48:04,883 --> 00:48:06,693
and I'm gonna become
some housewife.

760
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,403
Then I'm gonna turn
into your sister.

761
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,471
I'm gonna be Natalie, and
I don't want to be her.

762
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:12,366
Sam, you're not gonna be
Natalie. It's you and me.

763
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:13,950
That's what it's turning
into. I know that...

764
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:17,579
but this isn't what I
wanted to begin with, okay?

765
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:20,582
I didn't want to get
pregnant and now I am.

766
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:22,959
And I just want life
to go back to normal.

767
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:27,422
I don't want to talk about it anymore and
my fucking hair is falling out, okay?

768
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:28,924
Sam! Whoa.

769
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:34,763
- Hey.
- Hi. Are you excited?

770
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,765
- Yeah!
- Yeah, why?

771
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:40,936
- Because today's my First Communion.
- Oh, shoot, my bad.

772
00:48:46,717 --> 00:48:47,943
Hi.

773
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:51,238
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
How are you feeling?

774
00:48:51,305 --> 00:48:53,073
Well, well, well.

775
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,950
Are you ready for your
big day, young lady?

776
00:48:55,017 --> 00:48:57,643
- You've got the whole family here.
- Yeah.

777
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:00,455
- Hello, Sam.
- Hi.

778
00:49:00,522 --> 00:49:02,690
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing well, how are you?

779
00:49:02,691 --> 00:49:05,168
I'm good, really.

780
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:07,462
So, when is the little one due?

781
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:09,631
- One month.
- One more month.

782
00:49:09,698 --> 00:49:11,738
- One month. That's good.
- Are you all right?

783
00:49:11,742 --> 00:49:12,992
Do you want a bottle of water?

784
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:16,138
No, I'll be fine. One month.
That's the home stretch, right?

785
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,431
Yeah.

786
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:20,308
I've just got something in
my throat. I'm so sorry.

787
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,644
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

788
00:49:49,363 --> 00:49:52,507
I think that's the nicest
procession I've ever seen.

789
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:57,637
Boys and girls,
we are so proud of you.

790
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:59,389
And we are so happy...

791
00:49:59,456 --> 00:50:03,226
to have you here this morning on this
big important day in your lives.

792
00:50:03,293 --> 00:50:08,190
Newest members of our church to gather
round for the Liturgy of the Eucharist.

793
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:14,521
We are here to celebrate with you
today your first Holy Communion.

794
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,324
Also, the first time...

795
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:21,912
you receive our Lord Jesus
Christ into your souls.

796
00:50:22,479 --> 00:50:23,580
Uh...

797
00:50:30,779 --> 00:50:32,380
Excuse me.

798
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:36,218
Uh, this sacrament...

799
00:50:44,793 --> 00:50:47,628
It is a sacrament...

800
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:01,368
Father Thomas, are you okay?

801
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:14,256
Where was I?

802
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:24,432
He needs help!

803
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:27,018
It's okay, Father. Go call 911.

804
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:28,520
Thomas, Thomas.

805
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:31,773
Hey, whoa, Sam.

806
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,110
Hey, hey! Stop, Sam.

807
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:37,279
Look, it's me.

808
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:39,865
Hold on. Stop. Stop!

809
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:41,908
All right. Hey! It's okay.

810
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:49,374
I don't remember what
happened back there.

811
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:53,044
With Father Thomas.

812
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:58,300
Did I...

813
00:52:00,494 --> 00:52:02,637
Did I do that to him?

814
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:05,140
What? No.

815
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:07,851
Hey.

816
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:11,438
What the fuck is wrong with me?

817
00:52:11,755 --> 00:52:14,649
<i>Hey, hey! Stop, Sam.</i>

818
00:52:15,091 --> 00:52:16,818
<i>Look, it's me. It's Zach.</i>

819
00:52:16,885 --> 00:52:19,362
<i>Hold on. Stop. Stop!</i>

820
00:52:19,429 --> 00:52:21,489
<i>All right? Hey! It's okay.</i>

821
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:25,136
<i>- Zach...
- Let's just go. Let's just go home.</i>

822
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,604
<i>Oh, I am so sorry. Where was I?</i>

823
00:52:34,236 --> 00:52:36,821
<i>Jesus Christ into your soul.</i>

824
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:16,586
<i>Born from death.</i>

825
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:19,214
Twenty? Oh, it's free.

826
00:53:23,689 --> 00:53:25,953
<i>- Look at this little guy.
- Hey, little guy.</i>

827
00:53:25,954 --> 00:53:27,931
<i>Yeah, I hear it.</i>

828
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:29,724
<i>No, Zach, come on.</i>

829
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:34,145
<i>These men are staring at me.</i>

830
00:53:34,421 --> 00:53:35,462
<i>What?</i>

831
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:38,316
<i>I said, "These men
are staring at me."</i>

832
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:42,404
<i>Hey, babe, let's put it away.</i>

833
00:53:58,486 --> 00:53:59,667
- Come on.
- No.

834
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:02,966
<i>Yes. I'm sorry, but
we gotta get up.</i>

835
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,659
<i>Ugh.</i>

836
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,178
<i>I'm so hung over.</i>

837
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:09,305
<i>Yeah, no kidding.</i>

838
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:13,601
Hey, Mason, it's Zach. Um...

839
00:54:15,754 --> 00:54:19,357
Can you come over for a little bit?
I need to talk to you about something.

840
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:23,403
Thanks. And I'll meet you outside,
in front of the house, okay?

841
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,488
I don't want to bother Sam.

842
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:28,140
Okay.

843
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:29,909
<i>Mmm...</i>

844
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,704
<i>How did we get home last night?</i>

845
00:54:32,771 --> 00:54:34,789
<i>I don't know. The guy in the cab?</i>

846
00:54:35,732 --> 00:54:38,001
What the fuck?

847
00:54:55,919 --> 00:54:58,354
He was like our cab driver,
on our honeymoon.

848
00:54:58,421 --> 00:55:01,441
So I came home, looked at all the tapes,
and there's all this mystery fucking...

849
00:55:01,508 --> 00:55:02,591
Look at this.

850
00:55:02,592 --> 00:55:06,362
You sure, man? Maybe it's some weird shit
they do down there to scare tourists.

851
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:08,156
Whoa, what the fuck?

852
00:55:08,515 --> 00:55:09,991
What the fuck?

853
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:12,535
It's gone.

854
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:15,497
What are you talking about?

855
00:55:15,939 --> 00:55:19,667
I was literally just looking at
this shit right before you...

856
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:23,630
I was looking at this right before
you came in, and now it's gone.

857
00:55:23,697 --> 00:55:27,634
It's empty. It's gone. The
fucking tape is gone now.

858
00:55:28,535 --> 00:55:29,147
Fuck!

859
00:55:29,173 --> 00:55:32,931
- Why don't you just take a breath, man?
- No, I don't need to take a...

860
00:55:32,998 --> 00:55:35,350
Wait, hold on. What the fuck?

861
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:40,355
We've been monitoring him 24/7.

862
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:47,070
Uh, do you think I can
talk to him privately?

863
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:51,074
If he needs anything,
we'll be right outside.

864
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:58,123
Father Thomas, how are you?

865
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:02,085
I had a small stroke.

866
00:56:02,152 --> 00:56:03,795
Yeah, we heard.

867
00:56:03,945 --> 00:56:06,089
Are you gonna be all right?

868
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:10,635
How is Sam?

869
00:56:10,952 --> 00:56:14,639
Um, she's okay. That's
actually why I wanted to...

870
00:56:14,706 --> 00:56:18,059
- I'm glad that she's okay.
- Talk to you. Um...

871
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:24,607
I saw these weird symbols
on our honeymoon.

872
00:56:24,674 --> 00:56:29,070
And, um, I just don't know
really what they are.

873
00:56:29,137 --> 00:56:31,531
And I thought you might...

874
00:56:31,598 --> 00:56:35,034
because everything I've seen says
they're, uh, religious symbols.

875
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:38,496
So, uh, there's these ones...

876
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:42,917
and then there's that.

877
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:46,671
There's a bunch more.

878
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:49,007
These are the only ones I've
actually seen in person.

879
00:56:49,074 --> 00:56:52,218
The other ones were all just linked
to it when I started looking.

880
00:56:52,285 --> 00:56:56,222
- John, first John.
- What?

881
00:56:57,207 --> 00:57:00,143
First John, 2:18.

882
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:05,356
"And children,
this is the last hour."

883
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:09,319
"You have been told
the antichrist is coming..."

884
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:13,615
"and so, that there are
many that are coming."

885
00:57:14,766 --> 00:57:18,161
"That is how we know
it is the last hour."

886
00:57:18,228 --> 00:57:20,121
What are you talking about?

887
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:23,208
These are from early, early religion.
These are...

888
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:26,920
early religion, there
is a sect, dissident.

889
00:57:26,986 --> 00:57:30,548
They tried to bring the church
down in its early days.

890
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:34,344
They did rites, and they
used those symbols.

891
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:38,806
They painted them on the point
of entry and on the nest.

892
00:57:38,873 --> 00:57:41,976
The point of conception
and the point of birth.

893
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:44,586
- What?
- So that he could get in.

894
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:46,814
There was ash all around.
There was ash everywhere.

895
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:49,400
The antichrist is coming.

896
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:52,528
"So will there be
many antichrists..."

897
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:56,991
"and that is how we know
it is the last hour."

898
00:57:57,058 --> 00:57:58,368
"They will be coming."

899
00:57:58,434 --> 00:57:59,744
I didn't mean to upset you.

900
00:57:59,811 --> 00:58:01,913
- It's the last hour.
- I'm really sorry.

901
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:05,708
I don't think you can be here with
that anymore. You have to go now.

902
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:07,710
- I need you to go now, Zach.
- Yeah.

903
00:58:07,777 --> 00:58:10,171
I'm very, very tired
and I need you to go.

904
00:58:10,238 --> 00:58:12,006
- Put that away.
- It's gone.

905
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.
You've upset me. Just go.
- Go.
- I hope you feel better.
Now! Go!

906
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:21,527
Okay, all right.

907
00:58:22,584 --> 00:58:24,310
Nurse? Nurse, can you...

908
00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:28,064
Um this one is from you.
This is from Emily.

909
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:34,112
There's more to come.
That's just a taste.

910
00:58:34,971 --> 00:58:36,281
Whose is this one?

911
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:38,783
I don't know. It
doesn't have a name.

912
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:41,369
Does this belong to anybody?

913
00:58:41,436 --> 00:58:42,745
Well, anonymous.

914
00:58:42,812 --> 00:58:44,622
- It's nameless.
- Anon.

915
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:46,874
You're just getting
gifts from everywhere.

916
00:58:48,151 --> 00:58:50,920
Sorry, whoever this is from.

917
00:58:50,987 --> 00:58:52,297
Brooke!

918
00:58:52,614 --> 00:58:54,757
What a sweetheart, Brooke!

919
00:58:54,824 --> 00:58:57,719
I didn't read the note, so,
I don't know what's happening.

920
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:59,554
That's nice of you.

921
00:59:00,163 --> 00:59:01,723
Sam, are you okay?

922
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:14,402
How was the shower?

923
00:59:18,223 --> 00:59:19,681
Fine.

924
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,412
Did you hear that?

925
00:59:48,169 --> 00:59:49,604
Fuck.

926
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:05,571
Every window in the house,
but a lot of them in these.

927
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:10,041
This is really mostly where I see
it, so I don't know what to do.

928
01:00:10,108 --> 01:00:13,461
You know, I have to admit,
it is, uh, kind of weird.

929
01:00:15,183 --> 01:00:17,614
Someone was in here, all right?
Someone broke into our house.

930
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:19,967
- Wait, hold on a second.
- But, look at the porch.

931
01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:45,493
I can file a report, and call us
if there's any other problems.

932
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:49,330
That's all I can do for now.
You have a nice night.

933
01:01:37,445 --> 01:01:39,547
Okay, here we go.

934
01:01:39,614 --> 01:01:41,365
- Here he goes.
- You're gonna break your neck.

935
01:01:41,366 --> 01:01:42,949
Uh, uh, uh!

936
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:47,096
- Oh, he got it! No way!
- Wow, I'm so impressed.

937
01:01:47,163 --> 01:01:49,390
- What's up?
- Take this. I gotta take a piss.

938
01:01:49,457 --> 01:01:50,850
Oh, fuck.

939
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:52,501
I'm out.

940
01:01:52,502 --> 01:01:54,395
Do you want to come?
Will you hold it for me?

941
01:01:54,462 --> 01:01:57,190
No, she doesn't want to.

942
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:01,444
Since Jay's gone, do you want to...

943
01:02:01,636 --> 01:02:04,614
Hey, guys! You gotta come see this!

944
01:02:05,306 --> 01:02:07,241
- What is he doing?
- Fucker.

945
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:09,285
You're fucking me up.

946
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:11,412
Look what I caught.

947
01:02:11,479 --> 01:02:14,373
- What is that?
- Oh, fuck.

948
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:17,126
- Dinner is served, y'all.
- Jay, stop.

949
01:02:17,193 --> 01:02:19,253
- That is so gross.
- Oh, what in the fuck?

950
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,256
Please, don't touch it.
Oh, it fucking stinks!

951
01:02:22,323 --> 01:02:24,759
- Hey, take a photo.
- I'm taking a video, jackass.

952
01:02:24,826 --> 01:02:27,706
- It smells like shit.
- Touch it, see if it's still warm.

953
01:02:28,538 --> 01:02:31,456
- You guys, there is something over there.
- You're so fucked up.

954
01:02:31,457 --> 01:02:33,976
Look! Do y'all see that?

955
01:02:34,043 --> 01:02:35,203
- Shut up.
- What?

956
01:02:43,636 --> 01:02:44,737
Wait.

957
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,783
Yo.

958
01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:51,244
Hey.

959
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:54,830
- What is she doing?
- Ash, stay back.

960
01:02:56,732 --> 01:02:58,834
Ma'am, are you okay?

961
01:03:00,528 --> 01:03:02,630
What the fuck is she doing?

962
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit!
Ma'am, are you okay...

963
01:03:14,876 --> 01:03:16,686
What the fuck!

964
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:17,853
Run!

965
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:24,986
Come on, man. Get up!

966
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:28,281
What the fuck! Oh, shit!

967
01:03:41,736 --> 01:03:43,879
No! No!

968
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,400
Oh, fuck.

969
01:04:12,892 --> 01:04:14,785
Hey, are you all right?

970
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:18,831
Yeah, I'm good. Actually,
I feel a little bit better.

971
01:04:18,898 --> 01:04:20,708
Good. Um...

972
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:24,462
Do you need anything?

973
01:04:24,529 --> 01:04:26,047
No, I'm good. Thanks.

974
01:04:26,113 --> 01:04:27,715
Okay.

975
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:50,237
Sam?

976
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:54,492
Sam?

977
01:05:01,774 --> 01:05:03,042
Hey.

978
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:09,757
Sam.

979
01:05:24,797 --> 01:05:26,816
What are you doing?

980
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,905
Sam?

981
01:05:34,557 --> 01:05:36,450
Hey.

982
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:39,745
What's going on?

983
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:44,250
Are you okay?

984
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:49,613
Sam, what the fuck is going on?

985
01:05:49,614 --> 01:05:51,323
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

986
01:05:51,324 --> 01:05:53,509
Don't touch us!

987
01:05:54,577 --> 01:05:57,430
Sam, it's just me. All right?

988
01:05:57,997 --> 01:05:59,098
It's just me.

989
01:05:59,165 --> 01:06:01,517
Stop, stop, stop! Sam!

990
01:06:01,584 --> 01:06:05,146
It's okay, I think you're
dreaming. Hey, stop.

991
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:07,648
It's okay. It's okay.

992
01:06:07,715 --> 01:06:09,525
It's me. No, it's me.

993
01:06:11,302 --> 01:06:13,571
I got you. I got you.

994
01:06:14,055 --> 01:06:15,489
It's me.

995
01:06:16,057 --> 01:06:17,307
It's all right, I'm right here.

996
01:06:17,308 --> 01:06:21,162
See, see? Look, it's just me. Okay?

997
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:24,039
Are you okay?

998
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,066
It's okay.

999
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:28,502
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

1000
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:31,839
You just had a dream.

1001
01:06:33,908 --> 01:06:35,009
It's okay.

1002
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:40,347
It's okay.

1003
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:42,540
<i>The McCalls. Leave us a message,</i>

1004
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,894
<i>and we'll call you back
as soon as we can.</i>

1005
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:48,355
Hey, Dad, um, it's Zach. Uh...

1006
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:53,569
Look, I think Sam and I need to come
over and stay with you and Mom.

1007
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:57,364
Sam is really freaking out and
it's gotten me really scared.

1008
01:06:58,265 --> 01:07:01,660
It's just not normal, okay? And I
know this sounds really crazy...

1009
01:07:02,311 --> 01:07:05,414
but I swear, there have
been people watching us.

1010
01:07:05,481 --> 01:07:07,021
We just don't want
to be alone, okay?

1011
01:07:07,024 --> 01:07:09,919
I think we'd just feel a lot better
if we were with you and Mom.

1012
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:12,838
So, uh, call me back.

1013
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:38,656
Fuck.

1014
01:07:44,729 --> 01:07:45,996
Hey!

1015
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,873
Hey!

1016
01:08:03,998 --> 01:08:06,100
- Hey.
- Hi.

1017
01:08:06,959 --> 01:08:09,854
Thanks for coming over. Sam
is upstairs, she's sleeping.

1018
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,397
Is she feeling okay?

1019
01:08:11,464 --> 01:08:14,275
Yeah, she's fine. I just need
to take off for a minute.

1020
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:16,652
I didn't want her to wake
up and have no one be here.

1021
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:19,345
- Okay. Where are you going?
- Just don't answer the door.

1022
01:08:19,346 --> 01:08:21,407
Okay, bye.

1023
01:08:23,768 --> 01:08:25,619
Weirdo.

1024
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:45,764
Hmm.

1025
01:08:51,754 --> 01:08:52,855
Sam?

1026
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:59,570
Sam?

1027
01:09:06,435 --> 01:09:08,203
Hey, Sam?

1028
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:18,964
Hey.

1029
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:26,680
Sam?

1030
01:09:32,837 --> 01:09:34,855
Samantha?

1031
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:37,298
Sam?

1032
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,405
Samantha?

1033
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,000

Sam, Jesus! What are you doing?
Sam, hey, hey! Give this to me.
Stop, stop, stop. Sam, stop.
Give this to me.

1034
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,391
Sam!

1035
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:12,101
Sam, stop!

1036
01:12:27,136 --> 01:12:28,737
Fuck.

1037
01:12:30,848 --> 01:12:31,949
Shit.

1038
01:14:10,864 --> 01:14:11,965
Fuck.

1039
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,018
Fuck!

1040
01:14:32,261 --> 01:14:33,362
Oh, shit!

1041
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:46,208
<i>911, what's your emergency?
I need some help.</i>

1042
01:14:46,275 --> 01:14:48,502
Something is happening to my wife.
Please, send someone over.

1043

1044
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:53,530
<i>Sir, I'm sorry, I can't...</i>

1045
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:58,345
Shit.

1046
01:14:58,829 --> 01:15:00,389
What the fuck?

1047
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:10,941
What do you want?

1048
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:17,197
Leave us the fuck alone!

1049
01:15:17,598 --> 01:15:18,699
Sam?

1050
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:24,204
Ah!

1051
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:26,164
Fuck.

1052
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:49,813
Shit. Fuck.

1053
01:15:59,473 --> 01:16:01,158
Sam!

1054
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:12,961
What the fuck?

1055
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:15,756
Sam?

1056
01:16:28,252 --> 01:16:30,103
Sam?

1057
01:16:32,047 --> 01:16:33,774
Oh, Jesus.

1058
01:16:34,675 --> 01:16:35,984
What the fuck?

1059
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1060
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Sam!
Shit! Fuck!

1061
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:16,316
Sam!

1062
01:17:21,555 --> 01:17:23,323
Sam!

1063
01:17:26,935 --> 01:17:28,328
Sam?

1064
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:30,896
Sam, what are you doing?

1065
01:17:36,403 --> 01:17:37,671
What are you doing?

1066
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Stop, Sam. This isn't you.
Please. Please, just come with me.
Please, let's go. We gotta get...

1067
01:17:57,507 --> 01:17:58,859
Oh, God.

1068
01:18:03,847 --> 01:18:05,574
Suzie?

1069
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,701
Suzie? Suzie?

1070
01:18:08,185 --> 01:18:10,871
Fuck. No, no.

1071
01:18:10,937 --> 01:18:12,706
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1072
01:18:13,148 --> 01:18:14,749
Fuck.

1073
01:18:18,362 --> 01:18:19,463
Fuck.

1074
01:18:25,285 --> 01:18:26,386
Fuck.

1075
01:18:35,629 --> 01:18:36,730
Sam.

1076
01:18:37,798 --> 01:18:40,233
Please. It's okay.

1077
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:43,987
Come on, please. It's me.

1078
01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:46,406
Come on. Just come with me, please.

1079
01:18:48,016 --> 01:18:49,242
I'm sorry.

1080
01:18:49,309 --> 01:18:51,244
It's me, come on.

1081
01:18:51,812 --> 01:18:53,246
No!

1082
01:18:56,858 --> 01:18:58,418
No! Stop!

1083
01:19:00,487 --> 01:19:02,589
Please. Please.

1084
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:04,841
Sam. Sam!

1085
01:19:05,992 --> 01:19:07,093
Sam!

1086
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,970
What are you doing?

1087
01:19:09,037 --> 01:19:10,847
Please, just let me down.

1088
01:19:10,914 --> 01:19:13,308
Sam! Fuck!

1089
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,644
No! No, Sam!

1090
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:16,853
Sam, no!

1091
01:19:26,847 --> 01:19:29,282
Stop! Please stop, Sam!

1092
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:49,928
- Zach?
- Sam.

1093
01:19:50,537 --> 01:19:52,305
- Zach.
- I'm here.

1094
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:58,311
What happened? What happened?

1095
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:01,147
It's okay, it's okay.

1096
01:20:01,506 --> 01:20:05,610
- Is the baby okay?
- Yeah. I love you.

1097
01:20:06,344 --> 01:20:08,196
Is the baby okay?

1098
01:20:08,263 --> 01:20:11,116
Yes, it's okay.
Don't worry, it's okay.

1099
01:20:13,018 --> 01:20:14,202
I'm sorry.

1100
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:17,122
No. I love you. I love you.

1101
01:20:17,397 --> 01:20:20,041
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1102
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:27,215
No, no, Sam.

1103
01:20:27,282 --> 01:20:28,383
Sam.

1104
01:20:34,414 --> 01:20:36,182
Sam, no.

1105
01:20:36,249 --> 01:20:37,851
Fuck.

1106
01:20:42,255 --> 01:20:43,523
Please...

1107
01:20:56,895 --> 01:20:58,830
No. No, no!

1108
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:01,916
Stop. Just stop, please.

1109
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:06,171
Just leave us alone, please.

1110
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,175
No, leave her alone.

1111
01:21:10,242 --> 01:21:11,551
Leave her alone!

1112
01:21:24,589 --> 01:21:25,690
No.

1113
01:21:28,635 --> 01:21:30,236
Don't, don't, don't...

1114
01:21:33,974 --> 01:21:35,367
No, no. No!

1115
01:21:52,492 --> 01:21:55,679
So, what did you do with the baby?

1116
01:21:58,331 --> 01:22:00,266
They took it.

1117
01:22:01,668 --> 01:22:06,473
And this is the same "they" who
killed your wife and your sister?

1118
01:22:12,512 --> 01:22:14,080
You know, we checked.

1119
01:22:15,307 --> 01:22:18,818
The Anderson house.

1120
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:30,422
It's been abandoned for years.
Completely empty.

1121
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:38,805
And there's no Dr. Dylan at Willow Oak
or any other hospital in the area.

1122
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:45,603
Why don't you tell us...

1123
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:47,981
what really happened?

1124
01:22:52,802 --> 01:22:54,612
Mr. McCall?

1125
01:23:03,521 --> 01:23:05,081
Look at it. Oh, my God!

1126
01:23:05,148 --> 01:23:06,291
I got it, sweetie.

1127
01:23:06,358 --> 01:23:09,127
That's so amazing. It's
like a dream come true.

1128
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,797
Okay, last day of the honeymoon!

1129
01:23:15,075 --> 01:23:17,010
<i>Au revoir, Paris.</i>

1130
01:23:17,327 --> 01:23:19,179
All right, let's do one together.

1131
01:23:19,245 --> 01:23:20,847
Can we come back next year, baby?

1132
01:23:20,914 --> 01:23:23,641
- We are gonna come back every year.
- Okay, good. Promise?

1133
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:25,852
- It's been awesome, hasn't it?
- Best trip ever.

1134
01:23:25,919 --> 01:23:28,646
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

1135
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:31,941
Let's get a taxi.

1136
01:23:35,345 --> 01:23:37,697
- You got it.
- Perfect.

1137
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:39,598
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.</i>

1138
01:23:39,599 --> 01:23:41,034
You want a taxi?

1139
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:43,036
Yes, please.

1140
01:23:43,103 --> 01:23:44,996
- Come, get in.
- Okay.

1141
01:23:45,063 --> 01:23:47,707
- I take you somewhere fun, eh?
- Okay, yes.

1142
01:23:47,774 --> 01:23:50,627
Authentic. Outside the city, but...

1143
01:23:50,902 --> 01:23:53,103
- All right, good.
- Let's go somewhere fun.

1144
01:23:53,113 --> 01:23:55,673
- It's first time here?
- Yeah, it's the first time.

1145
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:59,677
- And newlyweds?
- Yeah, how did you know?

1146
01:23:59,994 --> 01:24:02,121
<i>Oogum, Oogum, Boogum,
Boogum, Boogum</i>

1147
01:24:02,122 --> 01:24:04,933
<i>Now, baby you're casting
your spell on me</i>

1148
01:24:07,377 --> 01:24:11,231
<i>You got me doing
funny things like a clown</i>

1149
01:24:11,548 --> 01:24:13,900
<i>Just look at me</i>

1150
01:24:15,677 --> 01:24:18,137
<i>When you wear
your bell-bottom pants</i>

1151
01:24:18,138 --> 01:24:20,406
<i>I just stand there in a trance</i>

1152
01:24:20,807 --> 01:24:24,518
<i>I can't move
You're in the groove</i>

1153
01:24:24,519 --> 01:24:26,687
<i>Would you believe, little girl</i>

1154
01:24:26,688 --> 01:24:29,999
<i>That I am crazy 'bout you</i>

1155
01:24:31,943 --> 01:24:35,129
<i>Now go on with your bad self</i>

1156
01:24:44,414 --> 01:24:47,517
<i>Now mercy, mercy on me</i>

1157
01:24:48,752 --> 01:24:49,835
<i>All right</i>

1158
01:24:49,836 --> 01:24:52,171
<i>When you wear those big earrings</i>

1159
01:24:52,172 --> 01:24:54,357
<i>Long hair and things</i>

1160
01:24:54,841 --> 01:24:58,319
<i>You got style, girl
That sure is wild</i>

1161
01:24:58,428 --> 01:25:00,679
<i>And you wear
that cute trench coat</i>

1162
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:03,265
<i>And you're standin' and posin'</i>

1163
01:25:03,266 --> 01:25:06,852
<i>You got soul
You got too much soul</i>

1164
01:25:06,853 --> 01:25:09,480
<i>I just say who got the blues
Say who got the blues</i>

1165
01:25:09,481 --> 01:25:11,023
<i>Say who got the blues now</i>

1166
01:25:11,024 --> 01:25:13,835
<i>Castin' your spell on me</i>

1167
01:25:23,703 --> 01:25:28,892
<i>Once upon a time
When I was in high school</i>

1168
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:36,482
<i>I was in love with you, lady
And you treated me so cool</i>

1169
01:25:38,718 --> 01:25:44,282
<i>I was driving a Chevy '72</i>

1170
01:25:45,683 --> 01:25:51,331
<i>It had four on the floor,
girl 120 it would do</i>

1171
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:55,901
<i>And I remember Marvin Gaye</i>

1172
01:25:55,902 --> 01:26:01,090
<i>Singin' What's Going On</i>

1173
01:26:08,623 --> 01:26:13,937
<i>And there was a war, baby
Somewhere across the sea</i>

1174
01:26:15,713 --> 01:26:18,757
<i>I don't wanna go and fight, girl</i>

1175
01:26:18,758 --> 01:26:21,778
<i>'Cause you were really lovin' me</i>

1176
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:28,910
<i>I remember Martin Luther King</i>

1177
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:36,376
<i>Lord, he was the man, babe
That gave us all a dream</i>

1178
01:26:36,776 --> 01:26:40,904
<i>And I remember Marvin Gaye</i>

1179
01:26:40,905 --> 01:26:46,094
<i>Singin' What's Going On</i>

1180
01:26:47,412 --> 01:26:50,098
<i>Don't play with my love</i>

1181
01:26:51,749 --> 01:26:55,878
<i>And I remember Marvin Gaye</i>

1182
01:26:55,879 --> 01:27:01,067
<i>Singin' What's Going On</i>

1183
01:27:08,725 --> 01:27:13,997
<i>They used to have
sweet music in the park</i>

1184
01:27:15,732 --> 01:27:21,379
<i>Lord, up at Monterey straight
down to the Melody Bar</i>

1185
01:27:23,656 --> 01:27:29,220
<i>You used to wear, girl
Them hot pants</i>

1186
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:36,352
<i>When you strolled down the hall
All the boys wanted a chance</i>

1187
01:27:36,794 --> 01:27:40,923
<i>And I remember Marvin Gaye</i>

1188
01:27:40,924 --> 01:27:46,112
<i>Singin' What's Going On</i>

1189
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:50,950
<i>Don't play with my love, oh</i>

1190
01:27:51,851 --> 01:27:56,289
<i>I remember Otis Redding</i>

1191
01:27:58,358 --> 01:28:01,127
<i>Sittin' at the Dock of the Bay</i>

1192
01:28:02,362 --> 01:28:05,965
<i>But then he went away</i>

1193
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:11,971
<i>And I remember Sam Cooke, y'all</i>

1194
01:28:13,706 --> 01:28:16,350
<i>So Bring It on Home to Me</i>

1195
01:28:17,377 --> 01:28:20,104
<i>From your love I can't be free</i>

1196
01:28:21,839 --> 01:28:26,486
<i>I remember Elvis Presley</i>

1197
01:28:28,721 --> 01:28:31,574
<i>And them Blue Suede Shoes</i>

1198
01:28:32,308 --> 01:28:35,661
<i>Lord, they gave me the blues</i>

1199
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:40,899
<i>I remember Marvin Gaye</i>

1200
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:46,422
<i>Singin', yeah Let's Get It On</i>
