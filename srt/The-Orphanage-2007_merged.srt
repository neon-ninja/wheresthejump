1
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:59,396
One, two, three,
knock on the wall!

2
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:04,202
One, two, three,
knock on the wall!

3
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:02,676
Good Shepherd Orphanage, hello?

4
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:06,315
It's all ready.

5
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:09,560
She's playing.
We haven't told her yet.

6
00:02:11,887 --> 00:02:15,118
She'll be happy in her new home.
Don't worry.

7
00:02:17,127 --> 00:02:18,162
See you then.

8
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:45,239
Your friends
will miss you a lot, Laura.

9
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:53,163
Got you!

10
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:51,205
THE ORPHANAGE

11
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:03,161
Mummy!

12
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:13,155
I'll go, it's my turn.

13
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:19,641
I'm coming!

14
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:40,476
Simon!

15
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:43,323
They're outside.
Listen.

16
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:49,006
Go to sleep.

17
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:53,404
Simon, darling.

18
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:55,995
Oh, I see!

19
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:58,556
Watson and Pepe
have played very late,

20
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:00,718
now they can't get in?

21
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:03,886
Come on, in you go.

22
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,882
Aren't you
a bit old for this?

23
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:12,359
Weren't you scared here,
when you were little?

24
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:15,565
You couldn't be afraid.
There was a gang of us,

25
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:17,525
and there was the lighthouse...

26
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:19,120
-Lighthouse?
-It's still there,

27
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:21,164
but it doesn't work anymore.

28
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:23,158
I'll show you tomorrow.

29
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,840
Why doesn't it work?

30
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:31,404
Can you keep a secret?

31
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:35,082
Actually, it does work.

32
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:38,405
But the light's invisible,
it protects us.

33
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:39,966
Invisible light?

34
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,559
OK, try this.

35
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:45,123
Look at the window, over there.

36
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:47,282
Don't move.

37
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:58,121
See it?

38
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:02,366
Did you see it?

39
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,599
Those kids that are coming,

40
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:07,441
why can't they stay at home?

41
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:09,563
They're special children,

42
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:12,400
and they need
a lot of special care.

43
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,603
They can't come and go,
they need a home.

44
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:16,086
You understand?

45
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,685
Can I sleep with you tonight?

46
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:26,002
You're pushing it, kiddo!

47
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,397
Dad, are you coming to the beach?

48
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,285
Aren't Watson and Pepe going?

49
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:26,200
No, they didn't sleep
a wink last night.

50
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:30,524
You're such a smartass!
Friends only when it suits.

51
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,844
OK, wise guy, take your pill.

52
00:07:38,687 --> 00:07:39,722
''S'' for Simon!

53
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:45,757
Go upstairs and get your bag.
Dad'll meet us there later.

54
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,801
One of us should talk to him.

55
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:54,806
About his invisible friends.

56
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:58,404
He's lonely, he's bored.
It's normal.

57
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:01,843
He'll forget them
as soon as the real kids arrive.

58
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:13,479
Everything will work out.

59
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:15,717
We'll have a great home.

60
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:19,922
I'm so glad we're here together.

61
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:30,601
Pirate.

62
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:32,556
Cave.

63
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:34,756
And lighthouse.

64
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:39,286
Once upon a time there was
a very, very bad pirate

65
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:42,803
who hid his treasures
in a cave, near a lighthouse.

66
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:45,242
-What treasures?
-Stolen treasures.

67
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:47,716
But it wasn't easy
to get into the cave.

68
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,040
How did they get in?

69
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:53,040
They'd click a stone
in a gap in the rocks...

70
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:20,755
Simon!

71
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:26,085
Simon, come on!

72
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:43,565
What's your name?

73
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:47,759
I'm Simon.
Do you want to play?

74
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:51,079
Why can't you play?

75
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:56,839
Do you want to come to my house
to play later?

76
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:01,000
What are you doing?

77
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:02,202
Playing.

78
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,164
But Watson and Pepe
didn't come.

79
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:05,646
It's another boy.

80
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:08,157
He shouldn't play here.
It's dangerous.

81
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:09,601
Come on, let's go.

82
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:16,122
Can he come home to play?

83
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:56,685
Why are you dropping shells?

84
00:11:56,847 --> 00:12:00,044
It's a path
for my friend to follow

85
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:01,640
so he can come and play.

86
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:04,605
-He made a new friend. How's that?
-Another one?

87
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:07,679
We won't have room
for all these kids.

88
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:38,757
Good afternoon.

89
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:41,198
Sorry I didn't call

90
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:44,086
but I couldn't get your number.

91
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,804
Benigna Escobedo.

92
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:49,324
I'm a social worker.

93
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,646
I'm sorry you've come so far

94
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:54,718
but there are no interviews today.

95
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:55,683
Interviews?

96
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:59,078
No, I'm here for Simon.

97
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:05,166
What a sitting room!

98
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:07,643
It's a beautiful house.

99
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:10,404
How did you find it?

100
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,767
I grew up here.
It was an orphanage.

101
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:16,567
I wanted to return,
so I thought of the home.

102
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:17,955
Home?

103
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:21,167
For special children.
That's not why you came?

104
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:24,319
You'll need a lot of people
for that.

105
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:25,886
It's not that kind of a home.

106
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:29,723
We'll be happy
with 5 or 6 children.

107
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:32,322
More would be too complicated.

108
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:36,806
What about Simon?

109
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:39,600
Yes, of course!

110
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:42,405
I received his file yesterday

111
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:45,926
and thought:
''I should visit them,

112
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:48,521
in case they need anything.''

113
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,839
Will you make many changes?

114
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:55,285
Sorry, I don't understand
why you're here.

115
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:05,960
This information's old.

116
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:07,799
I know, but I received it.

117
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,879
There are new treatments,
an experimental program

118
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:16,040
that requires an application,
You might be interested.

119
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:18,446
My husband is a doctor.

120
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:22,442
We're aware of all treatments
for Simon's disease.

121
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:25,284
Now please leave.

122
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,519
Simon doesn't know he's adopted,
or about his illness,

123
00:14:28,807 --> 00:14:31,685
and I'd rather deal with it
with my husband.

124
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:43,998
CHANGE OF RESIDENCE

125
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:47,602
HIV POSITIVE

126
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:52,315
Carlos.

127
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:56,601
I'll go. It's my turn.

128
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:15,526
Who's there?

129
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:40,564
What are you doing?

130
00:17:56,927 --> 00:17:58,121
Carlos!

131
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:00,443
What is it?

132
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:09,000
Planning to bash
the old lady's head in?

133
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,918
Sleep with Simon tonight.

134
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:30,643
If she shows up again,
we'll call the cops.

135
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

136
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:44,839
Can I wake up?

137
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:47,799
Can I wake up?

138
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:00,445
You are awake.

139
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,084
You can get up now.

140
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:08,798
Wendy gets old and dies?

141
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:12,960
Wendy gets old, but Peter Pan
takes her daughter to Neverland.

142
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:15,244
Why doesn't Wendy go too?

143
00:20:18,327 --> 00:20:21,080
If Peter Pan came to get me,
would you come too?

144
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:24,796
I'm too old to go to Neverland.

145
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:27,356
-How old are you?
-37.

146
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,085
At what age will you die?

147
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:35,038
What sort of question is that?

148
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:38,316
Not for a long time,
when you're much older.

149
00:20:39,207 --> 00:20:41,198
I won't get older.

150
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:42,996
I'm not going to grow up.

151
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:48,239
Like Peter Pan?

152
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:50,000
Like my new friends.

153
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:55,037
-There's more than one?
-Six.

154
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:58,005
-They won't grow up either?
-They can't.

155
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:34,237
What are they holding?

156
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:36,398
Treasures. To play with.

157
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:39,357
Your friends play together?

158
00:21:39,527 --> 00:21:40,118
Sure.

159
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:42,006
They steal your treasure,

160
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,045
something you love,
and you have to find it.

161
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:47,797
That's the game?
Finding treasure?

162
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:49,878
Yes, but following the clues.

163
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:52,999
If you find it,
they grant you a wish.

164
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:53,758
Well now.

165
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:56,678
And you have a treasure?

166
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:58,360
Special coins.

167
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,644
An old man left them in the park.
I think they're gold

168
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,005
and very valuable.

169
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:06,046
Want to see them?

170
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:13,837
Don't look yet.

171
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:19,607
-Where'd you get all this?
-I found it.

172
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:21,003
What's this?

173
00:22:21,447 --> 00:22:25,326
The first ice cream I had
after my tonsils operation.

174
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,199
The special coins.

175
00:22:31,927 --> 00:22:34,122
They're not coins,
they're milk teeth.

176
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:36,244
-Where'd you find them?
-See?

177
00:22:36,407 --> 00:22:39,717
They're the first clue.
They've got my coins.

178
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:43,003
You want to play treasure hunt?

179
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:44,881
The game's started.

180
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:47,607
Remember where you kept
my milk teeth.

181
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:51,237
If I find my treasure,
I can make a wish.

182
00:23:02,727 --> 00:23:04,877
Sand.
Where do you find sand?

183
00:23:05,727 --> 00:23:07,604
You set this up, right?

184
00:23:10,047 --> 00:23:12,277
-The beach?
-No, it has to be at home.

185
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:27,842
What's this?

186
00:23:29,927 --> 00:23:31,360
The sewing box!

187
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:34,323
Simon, wait!

188
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:50,846
Come on, hurry up!

189
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:15,006
This rings a bell.

190
00:24:15,407 --> 00:24:17,557
The key in the kitchen!

191
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:28,442
Those are Daddy's...

192
00:24:28,607 --> 00:24:30,086
I can make a wish!

193
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,400
Leave that alone!

194
00:24:33,927 --> 00:24:36,964
Those are our things,
you shouldn't touch them.

195
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:39,004
I didn't. It was them!

196
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,203
-Don't lie to me.
-I'm not lying.

197
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:44,756
You're lying!
You say you're my mother,

198
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:46,679
and you're not!

199
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,037
-What?
-You're not my mother.

200
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:53,842
-Who told you that?
-My friend told me.

201
00:24:54,007 --> 00:24:55,235
-What friend?
-Tomas.

202
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:58,080
Tomas said I'm just like them,

203
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,886
I have no mother or father.
And I'm going to die.

204
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:04,006
You're not my mother,
you're a liar!

205
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:23,480
We wanted you to be a bit older
to talk about certain things.

206
00:25:24,327 --> 00:25:26,522
If you want to ask us anything...

207
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:31,719
Is Father Christmas a lie too?

208
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,635
Simon...

209
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,525
You heard Mummy
and that lady,

210
00:25:36,847 --> 00:25:39,042
saw the envelope
and invented the game

211
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:42,085
because you were afraid
to ask about it.

212
00:25:43,847 --> 00:25:45,724
What if I don't take them?

213
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:47,645
Nothing would happen.

214
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,357
If I don't take them,
how soon would I die?

215
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:55,720
It would take many days,
even weeks.

216
00:25:56,207 --> 00:26:00,200
Don't worry, we'll take care of you.
You won't get sick or die.

217
00:26:01,447 --> 00:26:02,562
OK?

218
00:26:20,327 --> 00:26:22,204
You don't love me!
It's a lie!

219
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:27,716
Come down, son!

220
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:49,357
Hurry, the first kids are here!
Come on!

221
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:52,280
We can't go yet.
I want to show you something.

222
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:55,127
-What is it?
-Tomas' little house.

223
00:26:55,287 --> 00:26:57,562
Not now, darling.
You can show me tomorrow.

224
00:26:57,727 --> 00:26:58,318
No!

225
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,119
-Not now, Simon.
-Now!

226
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:03,280
Go downstairs right now!

227
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:04,880
I don't want to!

228
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:06,958
Come and see Tomas' house.

229
00:27:12,327 --> 00:27:14,761
If you don't want
to go downstairs, don't.

230
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,725
No one is forcing you.

231
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,004
WELCOME

232
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:53,561
Darling!

233
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:51,320
Simon, son.

234
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:35,726
What's going on?

235
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,082
Darling!

236
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,002
Darling!

237
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:28,236
He's over there, Carlos!

238
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,365
There's no one, Laura!
Come on.

239
00:32:30,847 --> 00:32:33,361
There's no one!
We can't stay here!

240
00:32:33,527 --> 00:32:35,995
He's there, Carlos!

241
00:33:09,727 --> 00:33:11,080
Carlos is here.

242
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:15,400
He spoke to the police,
and they want to talk to you.

243
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:24,682
How are you?

244
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:28,923
He's not in the caves.

245
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:31,079
But I saw someone, Carlos.

246
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:33,559
You must have imagined it,

247
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:35,285
in all the confusion.

248
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,677
Believe me, he wasn't there.

249
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:39,924
I'm Pilar.

250
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:46,440
I know it's hard, but you must know
we're doing all we can

251
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:48,764
to locate your son.

252
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,121
Pilar is a psychologist.

253
00:33:50,287 --> 00:33:52,118
She works with the police.

254
00:33:52,327 --> 00:33:54,602
They're working hard to find Simon.

255
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:56,359
I have a few questions.

256
00:33:58,727 --> 00:34:02,117
Your husband told me
about the adoption,

257
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:04,085
and your son's illness.

258
00:34:04,847 --> 00:34:06,678
As he was adopted,

259
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:08,883
There are possibilities
we must consider.

260
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:10,836
What possibilities?

261
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,204
That he has been kidnapped
by a relative.

262
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:17,637
I heard you recently found

263
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,479
a woman intruder
in the grounds.

264
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:22,244
Benigna Escobedo, a social worker,

265
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:24,359
came a few days ago.

266
00:34:24,527 --> 00:34:26,597
We can find no social worker

267
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:28,120
with that name.

268
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:30,480
Could you describe her?

269
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:37,637
She was about seventy,
with white hair,

270
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:42,084
pale eyes, very thick glasses.

271
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:46,198
We will find her.

272
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:48,725
You can be sure of that.

273
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:18,199
How can they trust me
with their kids after this?

274
00:35:24,887 --> 00:35:26,286
Let's do something.

275
00:35:26,447 --> 00:35:29,007
Wear my grandmother's
Saint Anthony medal.

276
00:35:30,407 --> 00:35:32,637
To bring us good luck.

277
00:35:34,127 --> 00:35:35,526
You don't believe that.

278
00:35:35,687 --> 00:35:37,723
Exactly. But you do.

279
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:40,485
Take it now.

280
00:35:40,727 --> 00:35:42,399
Give it back when we find Simon.

281
00:38:00,607 --> 00:38:04,600
<i>Simon Sanchez's parents</i>
<i>feel more and more forsaken.</i>

282
00:38:05,287 --> 00:38:07,926
<i>The 7-year-old boy disappeared</i>

283
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:10,760
<i>from his home 6 months ago.</i>

284
00:38:10,927 --> 00:38:13,202
<i>The situation</i>
<i>is even more desperate</i>

285
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:17,076
<i>because Simon is ill</i>
<i>and needs daily medication.</i>

286
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:19,564
My son disappeared 6 months ago.

287
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:22,326
His name is Simon.

288
00:38:27,247 --> 00:38:30,956
There are posters everywhere.
You may have seen them.

289
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,280
We've tried everything,

290
00:38:34,247 --> 00:38:35,475
but not one clue,

291
00:38:36,767 --> 00:38:38,359
not even a trace.

292
00:38:47,447 --> 00:38:50,007
My son had imaginary friends.

293
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
We never paid much attention but...

294
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:06,406
I have the feeling
they're in the house.

295
00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:12,636
I saw my daughter.

296
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:17,843
A year after her death.

297
00:39:23,087 --> 00:39:25,282
It was at night, we were asleep.

298
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:29,885
I woke up and,

299
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:33,879
without knowing why,
I went to her room.

300
00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:41,999
And there she was.

301
00:39:46,527 --> 00:39:48,518
Smiling. Calm.

302
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:55,925
It was her way of telling me:

303
00:39:57,087 --> 00:39:59,203
''I'm fine, I'm safe,

304
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,325
don't suffer for me.''

305
00:40:05,287 --> 00:40:08,996
It is not unusual to feel,
in some way,

306
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:12,686
the presence of a loved one
after their death.

307
00:40:13,647 --> 00:40:15,524
All of us in this group

308
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:18,042
could tell you similar stories.

309
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,479
You don't understand.

310
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:35,798
My son is not dead.

311
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:39,879
His friends took him.
I saw one of them.

312
00:40:40,887 --> 00:40:42,286
He was at home.

313
00:40:43,327 --> 00:40:45,761
I'll do whatever it takes
to recover my son.

314
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:48,516
I'm not crazy,

315
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,323
believe me.

316
00:40:52,727 --> 00:40:54,319
I know what I'm saying.

317
00:41:56,967 --> 00:41:57,797
It's her.

318
00:41:58,287 --> 00:42:00,562
The woman who came to the house.

319
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:03,441
Benigna?

320
00:42:26,087 --> 00:42:27,600
Simon!

321
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:48,838
We went to Benigna's house.
We found some pictures

322
00:43:49,007 --> 00:43:50,645
and old Super 8 films.

323
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,283
I'd like you to see them.

324
00:43:55,087 --> 00:43:57,362
Are any of the faces familiar?

325
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:01,680
Antonia, the principal, the orphans.

326
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:03,440
My friends.

327
00:44:04,247 --> 00:44:06,715
Martin.
She liked to be called Martin.

328
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:07,844
Rita.

329
00:44:08,807 --> 00:44:11,640
Victor...
I think his name was Guillermo.

330
00:44:11,807 --> 00:44:14,241
That's Alicia, she was blind.

331
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:16,043
And this is me.

332
00:44:21,687 --> 00:44:22,563
Benigna?

333
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:24,558
The woman you saw

334
00:44:24,727 --> 00:44:27,082
worked at the orphanage.

335
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:35,037
That's impossible. I'd remember!

336
00:44:35,207 --> 00:44:37,482
She wasn't there very long.

337
00:44:40,927 --> 00:44:43,122
She had a son. Tomas.

338
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:46,958
The child was deformed,

339
00:44:47,407 --> 00:44:49,967
he was kept away from the others.

340
00:44:50,207 --> 00:44:51,799
No one knew.

341
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,758
It was a total shock
when they found the body.

342
00:44:57,927 --> 00:44:58,757
What do you mean?

343
00:44:59,687 --> 00:45:02,918
It seems he disappeared while playing.

344
00:45:03,207 --> 00:45:05,277
CHILD'S BODY FOUND ON BEACH

345
00:45:05,447 --> 00:45:07,438
Shortly after your adoption.

346
00:45:07,927 --> 00:45:09,758
One of the orphans confessed

347
00:45:10,887 --> 00:45:12,798
that they had played
a trick on him.

348
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:15,083
They went into the caves
with Tomas

349
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,605
and took his mask off
to see if he'd come out.

350
00:45:19,527 --> 00:45:22,246
But he never emerged.
He drowned.

351
00:45:22,407 --> 00:45:24,682
They found his body at low tide.

352
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:29,603
The children weren't blamed.
They were only playing.

353
00:45:33,087 --> 00:45:34,406
That boy was in my house.

354
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
We asked everyone
at the opening party.
No one remembers a child
with a sack mask.

355
00:47:13,807 --> 00:47:16,480
I can't sleep through the night.

356
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:21,924
I can't stop thinking.

357
00:47:29,727 --> 00:47:32,446
Remember what we called Simon
when we met him?

358
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,086
''Two Little Kilos''.

359
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:40,159
''My two little extra kilos''.
That's all he weighed.

360
00:47:45,007 --> 00:47:47,919
The doctors said it wasn't enough.

361
00:47:49,887 --> 00:47:52,720
But it was plenty for us.

362
00:47:57,247 --> 00:47:58,919
Although we knew

363
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:04,081
there was little chance
he could ever be normal.

364
00:48:06,847 --> 00:48:08,678
But when we saw him,

365
00:48:11,727 --> 00:48:14,195
saw his smile for the first time...

366
00:48:15,247 --> 00:48:17,238
his eyes, his bright eyes...

367
00:48:21,847 --> 00:48:24,202
Simon made us strong, Carlos.

368
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:29,363
Together, we're strong.

369
00:48:30,727 --> 00:48:31,876
Together.

370
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:37,197
Forgive me if I get upset,
but it's hard.

371
00:48:50,287 --> 00:48:52,323
Carlos, someone's in the bathroom.

372
00:49:12,207 --> 00:49:14,118
-What is it?
-Someone was here.

373
00:49:18,807 --> 00:49:20,798
Carlos, feel, it's still warm.

374
00:49:20,967 --> 00:49:23,276
Sure, I just got up.

375
00:49:24,887 --> 00:49:26,559
Someone got into bed.

376
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,486
I'm convinced.

377
00:49:34,527 --> 00:49:37,280
That's what Jung means when he says

378
00:49:37,447 --> 00:49:39,836
it's in the subconscious that

379
00:49:40,007 --> 00:49:42,396
the living coexist with the dead.

380
00:49:43,887 --> 00:49:47,846
The Germans have another name
for ''the herald of death''.

381
00:49:48,007 --> 00:49:49,440
Doppelganger.

382
00:49:49,807 --> 00:49:53,197
A being that appears
in one's own image.

383
00:49:54,607 --> 00:49:56,006
A double.

384
00:49:56,607 --> 00:49:58,006
To glance at him,

385
00:49:58,167 --> 00:50:01,557
or at any of the others
I've shown you,

386
00:50:02,647 --> 00:50:05,207
means, without the slightest doubt,

387
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:09,484
a passport to the otherworld.

388
00:50:10,847 --> 00:50:13,441
How long has your son been missing?

389
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:15,246
Nine months.

390
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:21,840
Strange things are happening.
Things linked to his disappearance.

391
00:50:24,247 --> 00:50:25,919
I don't know who to turn to.

392
00:50:26,087 --> 00:50:27,361
It's not that simple.

393
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:31,076
You won't find an exorcist
in the yellow pages.

394
00:50:37,487 --> 00:50:39,159
This is from my son's kidnapper.

395
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:44,284
The police say he's been dead
for over 30 years.

396
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:46,882
Someone has my son.

397
00:50:47,567 --> 00:50:51,082
I don't know why.
But I won't do nothing.

398
00:50:52,847 --> 00:50:56,237
There's someone in this field,
someone I trust.

399
00:50:57,367 --> 00:50:59,642
I'm talking from the heart.

400
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:04,045
Would you allow a medium
to visit your home?

401
00:51:29,927 --> 00:51:33,397
This wasn't a children's room
in the orphanage.

402
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:35,842
The bedroom was back there.

403
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:40,357
Then we should start here.

404
00:51:40,527 --> 00:51:41,596
Enrique.

405
00:51:41,767 --> 00:51:42,404
Perfect,

406
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:43,966
give me an hour.

407
00:51:45,847 --> 00:51:48,520
I want an old object
from this house,

408
00:51:48,687 --> 00:51:52,202
something related to its history.
And, if possible,

409
00:51:52,767 --> 00:51:54,962
some clothing from the past.

410
00:51:58,367 --> 00:51:59,880
We're not alone.

411
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,807
There's a police psychologist, Pilar,

412
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:11,437
who would like to attend the session.

413
00:52:11,807 --> 00:52:13,684
If you don't mind.

414
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:17,043
Cops! The cops is cool!

415
00:52:34,047 --> 00:52:36,686
What does she need that doll for?

416
00:52:36,927 --> 00:52:39,521
To facilitate her trance.

417
00:52:40,087 --> 00:52:41,918
Clothing and objects
get her into it

418
00:52:42,887 --> 00:52:44,639
and begin the regression.

419
00:52:44,807 --> 00:52:47,037
-Regression?
-A psychic summoning.

420
00:52:47,407 --> 00:52:50,763
Past, present and future
are superimposed, and cross.

421
00:52:50,927 --> 00:52:52,360
Like a sort of time travel.

422
00:52:54,207 --> 00:52:56,004
It may sound like witchcraft,

423
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:58,635
but you mustn't fear
parallel perception.

424
00:52:59,047 --> 00:53:01,607
If there's anything,
Aurora will see it.

425
00:53:02,007 --> 00:53:04,567
I hope we'll all see it.

426
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,519
<i>Everything's ready, Enrique.</i>

427
00:53:12,967 --> 00:53:14,082
Whenever you want.

428
00:53:34,527 --> 00:53:36,722
-Aurora, can you hear me?
<i>-Perfectly.</i>

429
00:53:36,887 --> 00:53:38,206
Here we go.

430
00:53:45,807 --> 00:53:49,436
Everything around you
is beginning to fade.

431
00:53:50,287 --> 00:53:54,246
Darkness is forming
a circle around you,

432
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:56,922
it's closing in on you.

433
00:53:57,927 --> 00:54:01,237
Everything is fading.
We're no longer here.

434
00:54:01,927 --> 00:54:05,442
Now you're alone
in the darkness,

435
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,964
and the darkness
begins to disappear.

436
00:54:11,447 --> 00:54:13,403
I'm going to count down

437
00:54:14,047 --> 00:54:15,799
from ten

438
00:54:16,047 --> 00:54:17,639
and once I've finished,

439
00:54:18,007 --> 00:54:21,044
you can go
wherever you want

440
00:54:21,687 --> 00:54:23,564
and will be able to see

441
00:54:23,807 --> 00:54:27,686
anyone who is hiding in this house.

442
00:54:29,407 --> 00:54:30,726
Ten...

443
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:33,235
Nine...

444
00:54:34,287 --> 00:54:35,436
Eight...

445
00:54:51,727 --> 00:54:53,046
You can open your eyes.

446
00:55:03,047 --> 00:55:04,526
<i>It's cold,</i>

447
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:08,325
<i>the window is open.</i>

448
00:55:18,047 --> 00:55:18,843
Aurora,

449
00:55:19,327 --> 00:55:20,885
I want you
to look around you.

450
00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:23,005
Is there anyone with you?

451
00:55:25,167 --> 00:55:26,441
<i>I can hear someone.</i>

452
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,197
<i>I can hear...</i>

453
00:55:51,647 --> 00:55:53,000
<i>I hear something.</i>

454
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:06,441
<i>It comes and goes.</i>

455
00:56:16,647 --> 00:56:18,160
<i>I can't hear it anymore.</i>

456
00:56:21,047 --> 00:56:23,083
<i>I think I've lost them.</i>

457
00:56:32,647 --> 00:56:34,365
<i>I can hear something.</i>

458
00:56:39,407 --> 00:56:40,556
<i>...all alone.</i>

459
00:56:43,287 --> 00:56:44,606
<i>Children,</i>

460
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:46,439
<i>I'm sure it's children.</i>

461
00:56:49,647 --> 00:56:52,923
<i>At the end of the hall.</i>
<i>I think it's them.</i>

462
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:11,521
<i>I can't open it.</i>

463
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:13,766
<i>It's closed.</i>

464
00:57:17,487 --> 00:57:18,966
<i>But there's someone.</i>

465
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:23,084
<i>Why are you crying?</i>

466
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:26,884
<i>-We're sick!</i>
-Who's sick?

467
00:57:27,887 --> 00:57:29,559
<i>I won't hurt you.</i>

468
00:57:29,727 --> 00:57:33,163
<i>Open the door.</i>
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

469
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,196
<i>Open the door.</i>

470
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:38,803
<i>We want you to open the door!</i>

471
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:55,199
<i>What have they done to you?</i>

472
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,565
<i>What have they done?</i>

473
00:58:04,327 --> 00:58:05,157
Aurora,

474
00:58:05,327 --> 00:58:07,397
tell me what you see.

475
00:58:08,087 --> 00:58:09,440
<i>Five children.</i>

476
00:58:09,647 --> 00:58:12,525
<i>They're very sick.</i>
<i>They're crying.</i>

477
00:58:15,047 --> 00:58:16,526
<i>What happened?</i>

478
00:58:20,927 --> 00:58:21,962
<i>They're dying.</i>

479
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:24,277
<i>Who would want to poison you?</i>

480
00:58:30,087 --> 00:58:31,486
<i>Someone's going to kill us.</i>

481
00:58:32,407 --> 00:58:33,476
Is my son there?

482
00:58:34,687 --> 00:58:36,359
Aurora, is Simon with you?

483
00:58:39,127 --> 00:58:41,436
<i>Is Simon here?</i>

484
00:58:58,647 --> 00:59:00,717
Aurora, can you hear me?

485
00:59:01,607 --> 00:59:02,403
Let's get her.

486
00:59:02,807 --> 00:59:05,879
Aurora, stay in the middle
of the room.

487
00:59:06,047 --> 00:59:07,241
I'll count from ten.

488
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:08,724
Ten...

489
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:10,837
Nine...

490
00:59:11,287 --> 00:59:11,878
Eight...

491
00:59:34,847 --> 00:59:37,236
I was in the house, but...

492
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:39,600
everything was different.

493
00:59:39,767 --> 00:59:43,362
The beds, the toys, the decor,
everything was much older.

494
00:59:45,447 --> 00:59:49,042
The light from the lighthouse
came through the windows.

495
00:59:52,087 --> 00:59:53,918
You didn't see Simon?

496
00:59:55,687 --> 00:59:57,086
It was too dark,
I'm sorry.

497
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,523
I couldn't recognize anyone.

498
00:59:59,927 --> 01:00:01,280
But the children were there.

499
01:00:01,447 --> 01:00:03,756
You saw the children.
Is that right?

500
01:00:03,927 --> 01:00:04,518
That's right.

501
01:00:04,687 --> 01:00:06,518
You're talking about ghosts.

502
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:08,803
And what is a ghost, Carlos?

503
01:00:09,127 --> 01:00:11,641
There's something here,
and we all saw it.

504
01:00:13,487 --> 01:00:15,796
When something terrible happens,

505
01:00:16,287 --> 01:00:19,085
sometimes it leaves a trace,

506
01:00:19,847 --> 01:00:22,077
a wound that acts

507
01:00:22,607 --> 01:00:24,757
as a knot between two time lines.

508
01:00:25,647 --> 01:00:28,286
It's like an echo

509
01:00:28,447 --> 01:00:32,076
repeated over and over,
waiting to be heard.

510
01:00:32,567 --> 01:00:34,478
Like a scar...

511
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:35,841
Oh, I'm sorry.

512
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:38,283
Like a scar or a pinch

513
01:00:39,047 --> 01:00:41,720
that begs for a caress
to relieve it.

514
01:00:45,127 --> 01:00:46,276
Laura...

515
01:00:49,407 --> 01:00:53,036
we who are close to death,

516
01:00:53,207 --> 01:00:56,358
we are more receptive
to these messages.

517
01:00:59,647 --> 01:01:03,037
You mean my son
could see those children

518
01:01:06,327 --> 01:01:07,237
because...

519
01:01:08,727 --> 01:01:10,001
That's enough.

520
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,998
Please take your things and leave.

521
01:01:12,967 --> 01:01:14,719
We can't let them go like this.

522
01:01:14,887 --> 01:01:16,878
Laura, this is a farce,

523
01:01:17,647 --> 01:01:18,716
a sideshow trick.

524
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:21,082
I can't believe this. Why?

525
01:01:21,447 --> 01:01:24,166
For what reason?
They're right...

526
01:01:24,327 --> 01:01:26,204
-They don't want money.
-Not yet.

527
01:01:27,367 --> 01:01:28,641
What should I do?

528
01:01:28,807 --> 01:01:30,206
What should I do?

529
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:33,200
The police haven't found
a single clue

530
01:01:33,367 --> 01:01:35,927
as to whether he's
dead or alive.

531
01:01:36,087 --> 01:01:37,918
What do I do,
just sit and wait?

532
01:01:38,087 --> 01:01:39,440
Can it hurt to listen?

533
01:01:39,607 --> 01:01:41,165
-Laura, stop!
-No, you stop!

534
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:43,236
Pilar...

535
01:01:43,527 --> 01:01:47,076
How many similar cases
have you had in this damned village?

536
01:01:48,527 --> 01:01:50,961
Get another distraction,
I didn't invite you here.

537
01:01:58,527 --> 01:01:59,880
What should I do?

538
01:02:00,047 --> 01:02:01,002
My dear,

539
01:02:01,407 --> 01:02:03,477
you are a good mother.

540
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:06,724
Your pain gives you strength,
it will guide you.

541
01:02:08,007 --> 01:02:12,000
But only you know
how far you are willing to go

542
01:02:12,367 --> 01:02:14,164
to find your son.

543
01:02:14,487 --> 01:02:15,920
I don't know what to do.

544
01:02:16,087 --> 01:02:18,203
You hear, but don't listen.

545
01:02:19,247 --> 01:02:22,080
Seeing is not believing.
It's the other way around.

546
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:26,035
Believe,

547
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,806
and you will see.

548
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:46,281
What are you doing?

549
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:59,241
We can't stay here any longer.

550
01:02:59,967 --> 01:03:02,242
We should go,
at least for a while.

551
01:03:04,767 --> 01:03:08,077
The children are here.
Aurora saw them. I can't leave.

552
01:03:08,247 --> 01:03:09,566
You heard the voices.

553
01:03:09,727 --> 01:03:12,480
That Enrique could have faked it all.

554
01:03:12,647 --> 01:03:15,081
Can't you see it could be a set-up?

555
01:03:15,327 --> 01:03:17,124
That's Pilar's theory,
a set-up?

556
01:03:17,847 --> 01:03:20,361
-Her rational theory?
-She's protecting us.

557
01:03:21,647 --> 01:03:23,000
From what?

558
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:24,725
Things like this evening.

559
01:03:24,887 --> 01:03:27,879
People entering our home
and fucking up our lives.

560
01:03:28,727 --> 01:03:31,082
-They just want to help.
-Help?

561
01:03:31,247 --> 01:03:32,885
Didn't you hear them?

562
01:03:33,367 --> 01:03:35,801
Did they mention finding Simon?

563
01:03:36,087 --> 01:03:38,237
They just want to contact the dead.

564
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:47,996
If Simon's alive,
I can't see how they can help us.

565
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:53,241
If he's not,
they won't recover him.

566
01:03:53,527 --> 01:03:55,961
I don't want to keep
taking this shit.

567
01:03:56,127 --> 01:03:58,322
Please, let's leave this house.

568
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:04,961
You can't ask me to give up.
Neither you nor Pilar.

569
01:04:06,967 --> 01:04:10,118
We can survive this. Many couples
lose a child and pull through.

570
01:04:10,287 --> 01:04:13,643
I want to be with Simon,
don't you understand?

571
01:04:13,807 --> 01:04:17,720
If you want to go, I can't stop you.
I just want to know

572
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:19,479
where he is!

573
01:05:23,247 --> 01:05:24,760
Where are you?

574
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,366
I'm not afraid.

575
01:06:33,127 --> 01:06:34,640
You want to play?

576
01:06:36,487 --> 01:06:38,125
Are you playing with me?

577
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

578
01:08:56,967 --> 01:08:58,366
Benigna?

579
01:11:01,687 --> 01:11:03,882
Please, don't let it be Simon.

580
01:12:23,367 --> 01:12:25,437
-There are five, right?
-Yes.

581
01:12:25,847 --> 01:12:27,360
All my friends.

582
01:12:27,767 --> 01:12:30,520
Martin, Rita, Alicia,
Guillermo, Victor.

583
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:36,117
Benigna killed them.
That's why she went to the shed,

584
01:12:36,287 --> 01:12:38,084
to recover their bodies.

585
01:12:38,247 --> 01:12:39,236
I've thought it out.

586
01:12:39,727 --> 01:12:41,957
Their game killed Tomas

587
01:12:42,127 --> 01:12:45,244
and now they're playing
with Simon and me.

588
01:12:47,167 --> 01:12:50,159
Simon's in danger
and I don't know how to play.

589
01:12:50,847 --> 01:12:51,882
I don't know how to play.

590
01:12:52,047 --> 01:12:53,639
Laura, you're making it up.

591
01:12:53,807 --> 01:12:55,638
I saw it myself.

592
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:58,560
And this afternoon?
Who laid out the clues?

593
01:12:58,727 --> 01:13:00,604
Simon made it all up.

594
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:02,166
Who?

595
01:13:02,327 --> 01:13:03,646
Tell me! Who?

596
01:13:05,727 --> 01:13:08,082
I've packed.
I don't want us to stay here.

597
01:13:10,087 --> 01:13:11,122
I can't leave yet.

598
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:13,437
I won't live here,

599
01:13:14,407 --> 01:13:15,886
and you're not staying alone.

600
01:13:17,047 --> 01:13:20,005
I can't just leave,
there are too many memories.

601
01:13:20,767 --> 01:13:22,485
I have to say goodbye.

602
01:13:28,127 --> 01:13:29,401
Two days.

603
01:13:29,847 --> 01:13:30,802
Alone.

604
01:13:32,807 --> 01:13:34,525
Please, I need this.

605
01:13:36,807 --> 01:13:38,081
Please.

606
01:17:42,447 --> 01:17:44,199
Please bless
what you have given us.

607
01:17:48,767 --> 01:17:52,760
Thank you for letting us
gather once again

608
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,003
and be together.

609
01:18:22,367 --> 01:18:24,597
What else do you want?

610
01:18:25,527 --> 01:18:27,518
What more must I do?
What?

611
01:18:28,927 --> 01:18:30,918
I have no time,
I have no time.

612
01:18:43,527 --> 01:18:46,360
You want to keep playing?
Is that it?

613
01:18:46,687 --> 01:18:48,882
Let's make a deal.
I'll play a while,

614
01:18:49,047 --> 01:18:51,402
then you tell me where Simon is.

615
01:18:53,727 --> 01:18:55,046
OK?

616
01:19:22,687 --> 01:19:25,485
One, two, three,
knock on the wall!

617
01:19:35,127 --> 01:19:37,766
One, two, three,
knock on the wall.

618
01:21:06,567 --> 01:21:08,364
Wait, wait!
No.

619
01:21:08,527 --> 01:21:11,246
I won't hurt you.
I just want to find Simon...

620
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

621
01:25:21,407 --> 01:25:22,760
Why are you crying?

622
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:25,561
Oh, my darling!

623
01:25:28,327 --> 01:25:30,966
Are you OK?
You're freezing.

624
01:25:32,287 --> 01:25:34,005
Don't worry about a thing.

625
01:25:34,287 --> 01:25:36,323
Don't be afraid,
I'll get you out.

626
01:25:45,407 --> 01:25:47,125
Stay and play with us.

627
01:25:48,247 --> 01:25:49,521
We can't stay to play.

628
01:25:55,927 --> 01:25:57,804
Listen to me, Simon.

629
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Imagine it's just you
and me here. OK?
Think about before we came
to this house.

630
01:26:05,567 --> 01:26:06,886
Remember?

631
01:26:07,087 --> 01:26:09,157
Think only about that, OK?

632
01:26:09,327 --> 01:26:11,477
Think only about that,

633
01:26:11,927 --> 01:26:13,042
think about Daddy,

634
01:26:13,207 --> 01:26:15,038
think about next Christmas,

635
01:26:15,207 --> 01:26:17,801
and all the things we'll do together.

636
01:26:18,247 --> 01:26:19,646
So many things, darling!

637
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:22,116
Close your eyes, tight,

638
01:26:22,287 --> 01:26:24,596
shut them really tight

639
01:26:25,967 --> 01:26:29,323
and think about what you'll be
when you grow up.

640
01:26:29,727 --> 01:26:32,002
What would you like to be, darling?

641
01:26:32,167 --> 01:26:35,637
Think about the schools you'll go to,
the friends you'll make.

642
01:26:38,007 --> 01:26:39,884
And just believe for a moment

643
01:26:42,087 --> 01:26:45,363
that Tomas and the other children
aren't real.

644
01:26:46,567 --> 01:26:48,523
This is a fantasy, my darling,

645
01:26:48,727 --> 01:26:50,285
like a nightmare.

646
01:26:54,367 --> 01:26:56,198
Do it for me, Simon.

647
01:26:57,127 --> 01:26:58,845
When you open your eyes,

648
01:27:00,087 --> 01:27:01,361
make them go away.

649
01:27:25,887 --> 01:27:27,479
Close your eyes, darling,

650
01:27:27,887 --> 01:27:29,684
and keep on playing with me.

651
01:27:32,607 --> 01:27:35,326
Keep on playing, darling, OK?

652
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

653
01:28:17,847 --> 01:28:20,042
<i>-What is it?</i>
<i>-Tomas' little house.</i>

654
01:30:18,167 --> 01:30:20,203
I found you.
This isn't fair.

655
01:30:24,767 --> 01:30:26,519
I found you...

656
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:08,564
I want Simon back!

657
01:33:07,807 --> 01:33:09,445
Mummy, can I wake up?

658
01:33:13,247 --> 01:33:15,636
Of course you can, darling.

659
01:33:20,167 --> 01:33:20,917
Mummy...

660
01:33:23,047 --> 01:33:24,878
I found the special coins.

661
01:33:25,047 --> 01:33:27,481
Now I just have to make a wish.

662
01:33:28,367 --> 01:33:31,564
I wish you'll stay
and look after all of us.

663
01:34:25,647 --> 01:34:26,397
It's Laura!

664
01:34:40,567 --> 01:34:43,286
She's grown old,
like Wendy in the story.

665
01:34:47,487 --> 01:34:48,806
It's Laura.

666
01:34:55,487 --> 01:34:56,966
Come, don't be afraid.

667
01:34:59,327 --> 01:35:03,320
The house. The beach.
The lost children.

668
01:35:08,887 --> 01:35:10,445
Once upon a time

669
01:35:10,607 --> 01:35:12,916
there was a house near the beach

670
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:15,846
where the lost children lived...

671
01:35:53,727 --> 01:35:55,763
In memory of Laura and Simon

672
01:35:55,927 --> 01:35:57,565
and of the orphans

673
01:35:57,727 --> 01:36:00,799
Martin, Rita,
Guillermo, Alicia, Victor

674
01:36:00,967 --> 01:36:02,320
and Tomas

675
01:41:09,407 --> 01:41:11,762
