1
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:45,375
- We haven't seen
Jackson in over a year.

2
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:48,160
His friends said he
went to that old hotel

3
00:00:48,204 --> 00:00:49,901
to look for a
souvenir or something.

4
00:00:52,473 --> 00:00:54,692
That was the last time
anybody ever heard from him.

5
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:07,836
Every time we're about to
let go, something happens,

6
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:08,880
something

7
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:12,227
strange,

8
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:14,616
and it just rips our hearts out.

9
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:18,394
It started with text messages,

10
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:22,093
randomly in the
middle of the night.

11
00:01:22,137 --> 00:01:24,226
I told the police and
they looked into it

12
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,272
and they found...

13
00:01:30,276 --> 00:01:32,887
They found they were coming
from inside the hotel.

14
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:57,128
My husband watched the
video of Jackson lost inside

15
00:01:57,172 --> 00:02:01,089
the hotel but I can't bring
myself to sit through it.

16
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:06,442
I know he used his phone
to try and get help.

17
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:11,273
Phone calls and video messages

18
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:12,187
and texts.

19
00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:19,281
- If you get this message,

20
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:21,979
please send help to
the Abaddon Hotel.

21
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:24,243
I can't, there's no way out.

22
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:26,288
I saw them all.

23
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:28,334
They're all here.

24
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:29,987
They're all still here.

25
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,036
Please, somebody hear me!

26
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:35,906
Somebody!

27
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:40,036
They want me to go with them.

28
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,479
They want me to go with them.

29
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:44,917
Please!

30
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:46,440
Please, someone help.

31
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:50,662
They have no eyes.

32
00:03:20,788 --> 00:03:22,703
No one's coming for me.

33
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:28,927
I'm sorry I ever came here.

34
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,933
I don't know where
they all came from.

35
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:43,110
They're all in the dining room.

36
00:03:43,154 --> 00:03:44,982
They're all in Hell.

37
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:48,420
They're all with him.

38
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:53,251
Mom, I'm sorry...

39
00:03:55,122 --> 00:03:58,343
- About two weeks
later I got an email

40
00:03:58,387 --> 00:03:59,475
from Jackson's account,

41
00:04:02,303 --> 00:04:03,522
I didn't wanna open it.

42
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,221
I mean, I knew it couldn't
be from him, right?

43
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:08,005
I opened it.

44
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:12,401
And I watched the video.

45
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:17,754
Oh, my God.

46
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:19,059
God, I wish I hadn't.

47
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:26,110
It was an empty room

48
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:33,334
and then I could hear
Jackson's screams.

49
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:37,208
And there was something else,

50
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:40,603
there was this piano
playing somewhere

51
00:04:42,343 --> 00:04:44,215
and I knew immediately I'd
heard that tune before.

52
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:46,173
It was so familiar.

53
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,092
- Please!

54
00:04:52,136 --> 00:04:54,225
Please, somebody!

55
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:55,879
Somebody help me!

56
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:56,662
Please!

57
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:04,757
- We've heard that
piano tune before

58
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:06,846
in the Hell House documentary,

59
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,414
but when the Mallet's say
that they've heard it,

60
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,896
they're referring to
long before Hell House.

61
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,506
- Orca.
- Go Fish.

62
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,334
- Anyone got an orca?

63
00:05:16,377 --> 00:05:18,075
- I got one.
- I got an orca.

64
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,555
- Orca.
- Okay, thank you.

65
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:22,079
- Hey, I saw you,
you're cheating!

66
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,168
- I'm not cheating!
- Hey, hey, hey.

67
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:25,691
- Mom!
- Mom, are you getting this?

68
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:27,998
- Guys, calm down,
Jackson's asleep, come on.

69
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,261
- Oh, my God.
- So unfair.

70
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:32,306
- Play nicely, come on.

71
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,004
- Got a fish?
- Got a crab?

72
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:36,485
- Carlie, do you have a crab?

73
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:39,096
- Hey guys, do you hear that?

74
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,445
Where's that coming from?

75
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,510
- Jackson, I
thought you were in bed.

76
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:05,775
- The hotel opens
in 2009, tell everyone.

77
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:08,255
- What, what hotel?

78
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,302
- Who turned
out the lights?

79
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,530
- Hey,
Jackson, are you okay?

80
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:23,096
- Yeah.

81
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,272
- Are you sure,
what were you talking about?

82
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:26,883
- Nothing, I didn't
say anything.

83
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:30,800
- Later on, and I played it back

84
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:32,453
with my husband, we heard it.

85
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:36,893
There's another
voice in that room.

86
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:39,373
It's almost,

87
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,290
almost like it could
hear my question

88
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:45,597
and was telling
Jackson what to say.

89
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:51,037
- Who turned
out the lights?

90
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:52,473
- The Abaddon Hotel.

91
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,610
- This hotel has a
long history of eerie

92
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:02,179
and unexplained events
being caught on camera.

93
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:06,139
Even our own cameras weren't
immune to catching something

94
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:09,360
spooky when we rehearsed
this very segment.

95
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:12,189
Okay, am I close in enough?

96
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:13,886
How's my frame?

97
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:16,410
Good?

98
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:18,543
Gary, what?

99
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:46,440
It's been two years since
the controversial release

100
00:07:46,484 --> 00:07:48,355
of the Hell House documentary

101
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,401
and many of us still
have questions.

102
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:52,925
The biggest question
on everyone's mind,

103
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:55,536
was it real or was
it an elaborate hoax

104
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,148
planned by the documentarians
to sell the film?

105
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:01,542
Here today we have a full
panel to discuss this question.

106
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:03,632
Arnold Tasselman, who worked
for the Rockland County

107
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:06,939
Magistrate's Office at the
time of the Hell House incident

108
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:10,073
seven years ago and
Mitchell Cavanaugh,

109
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:12,466
the Mitchell Cavanaugh
from the documentary,

110
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,687
allegedly the only surviving
member of the film.

111
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:17,297
We'll get into that.

112
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:20,474
And lastly, we have Brock
Davies, a medium and psychic

113
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:22,389
who you may know from
his work on several

114
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:26,132
missing persons cases that
gained nation-wide attention.

115
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:27,438
- Thanks for having me on, Suzy.

116
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:30,223
Somehow I knew you'd call.

117
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:33,270
Be sure to check out
Brock Davies From Beyond,

118
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,446
coming next fall to--
- Thank you, Brock.

119
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:38,754
So, why don't we start--
- Suzy, do you mind

120
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:40,886
if I start with a
comment and a question?

121
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:42,975
- Sure.
- Thanks.

122
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:44,063
- You're a dick.

123
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:47,719
Comment, and my
question is, why?

124
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:49,199
Look at this.
- Camera's up.

125
00:08:52,202 --> 00:08:53,725
- Who is that?

126
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:55,858
- That's Mitchell Cavanaugh
from the Hell House documentary.

127
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:58,164
That's who we need to
get us into the Abaddon.

128
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,863
- Well, from what we saw,
getting in isn't the problem,

129
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:02,342
it's finding our
way to the basement

130
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:04,388
and finding our way out.
- Well, exactly.

131
00:09:04,431 --> 00:09:05,911
He edited all the
Hell House footage,

132
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:08,566
he must know the
hotel inside out.

133
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:09,610
- Maybe.

134
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:13,789
- Arnold here has
served me with a lawsuit

135
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:17,053
trying to get my film off the
market so no one can see it.

136
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:18,619
- Mr. Tasselman,

137
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:20,578
can you discuss the
lawsuit against Mitchell?

138
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:24,103
- I'm not able to discuss
details about pending litigation

139
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,324
but what I can tell you
is that his fake movie

140
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,587
has caused harm to
the town of Abaddon.

141
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,198
- Cold cases in old hotels
is not really our thing,

142
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:34,244
we put a state Senator in jail!

143
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:36,725
Yeah, and that was
a really good thing

144
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:38,814
but now they're saying
this place is haunted.

145
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:41,468
- Oh, come on, Molly, don't
tell me you believe in ghosts.

146
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:44,080
Look, we're going to the
Abaddon, that's final.

147
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:45,559
You two track down
Mitchell today

148
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:47,431
and get him to meet me.

149
00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:49,259
- Got ya.
- What are you doing?

150
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:51,130
- I'm calling into this show.

151
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,437
This guy is such a fucking liar.

152
00:09:55,482 --> 00:09:57,484
- Hell House was a tragedy

153
00:09:57,528 --> 00:09:59,791
and we still mourn
the loss of life.

154
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:02,402
What I'm talking about is
faking everything about

155
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:06,363
the hotel's owner, the
supposed Hell House tapes.

156
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,061
Putting that quack author
Robert Lyons on camera,

157
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:11,107
faking a full scene
with your own crew

158
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,673
in a room where you
knew that people--

159
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:15,415
- You're talking
about Diane Graves,

160
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:17,940
the missing documentarian
who was last seen

161
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,116
on her own video
inside the hotel.

162
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,596
- That is exactly what
I am talking about.

163
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,469
- Excuse me, Diane is dead.

164
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:27,384
Okay, Johnathan is dead.

165
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,560
They died inside that
hotel.

166
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:31,431
- Can we not use that word?
- I'm sorry.

167
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:34,043
- Please, everyone
knows that no one died

168
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:36,567
outside of the
Halloween malfunction.

169
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,656
- You're still going
with malfunction,

170
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:41,833
like a prop fell from the
ceiling and killed 15 people?

171
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:44,749
- I'd actually like to
jump in on that point.

172
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:47,708
I, too, would like to
know how the police

173
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:50,668
arrived at calling
it a malfunction?

174
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:53,236
- The details of that
night are still not allowed

175
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,761
to be discussed publicly.
- Of course.

176
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:59,808
- But, from everything
that I've seen,

177
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:03,420
I can guarantee the public
that the hotel is safe

178
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,727
and is not responsible in
any way for the tragedy

179
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:09,252
nor anything else that people
are alleging happened since.

180
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:11,863
- If it's so safe,
why does the town keep

181
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:14,300
police cars outside
at all times,

182
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:16,128
making sure no one goes in?

183
00:11:16,172 --> 00:11:17,738
- We were
here like yesterday

184
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:20,654
while you guys were off
filming that goofy TV thing

185
00:11:20,698 --> 00:11:24,963
and we deduced that there
was a 10 minute window

186
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:26,225
and we can get it.

187
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:29,968
Badass, right?
- Why do they guard it so much

188
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:31,752
if they're saying there's
nothing wrong with it?

189
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:33,885
- Yeah, man, like--
- Well, it's not just

190
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:36,583
the Hell House incident
or Diane, there are also

191
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:40,152
two teenagers from the nearby
area that have disappeared.

192
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:43,634
- And people think that has
something to do with the hotel?

193
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:46,463
- Well, of course anything
could have happened to them

194
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:50,597
but, one poor kid streamed
himself on Facebook

195
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:52,643
while breaking in and it was
the last time he was ever seen.

196
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:54,775
- Are you serious,
when did that happen?

197
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:57,517
- I mean, I'm sure
Jessica knows all of this.

198
00:11:57,561 --> 00:11:59,911
- Dude, she doesn't
even believe in ghosts.

199
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:03,654
- Neither did Diane.
- I'd like to point out,

200
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:06,439
and I think it's important
to clarify for the audience,

201
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:10,226
that these poor individuals
who have gone missing

202
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:12,750
were amateur ghost
hunters, these were not

203
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:15,927
trained professional
paranormal investigators.

204
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:18,495
- Thank you, Brock,
and let's go ahead

205
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,627
and show our viewers
the Facebook Live video

206
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:22,499
for those who
haven't yet seen it.

207
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,326
Go ahead.

208
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:29,854
- All right.

209
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:31,900
It looks like nobody's
here right now.

210
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:35,120
Should be able to get in and out

211
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:37,296
without being seen, all right.

212
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:43,520
To my fans, love
you all very much,

213
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:44,825
I told you I would do this.

214
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:46,653
Yeet, eh?

215
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:47,480
All right.

216
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:51,136
You can just check
out my channel,

217
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,487
the old warehouse video, all
kinds of stuff like that.

218
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:56,707
The abandoned mineshaft
just two weeks ago.

219
00:12:58,752 --> 00:12:59,753
All right.

220
00:13:02,843 --> 00:13:06,108
No, Rachel, I actually, I'm
wearing boxer briefs right now.

221
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,204
I'm not stopping.

222
00:13:16,683 --> 00:13:18,337
You've just gotta
admit that was,

223
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:22,254
that was pretty weird.

224
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:23,081
All right.

225
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:30,784
Not taking any chances.

226
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:34,875
Here we go.

227
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,729
I'm sorry,

228
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:03,774
I'll go now.

229
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:24,186
- What's strange about
that video is that

230
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:27,841
it never cut, it kept on
streaming through the night

231
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:30,844
in that exact position
until the phone's battery

232
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:32,455
ran out at dusk.

233
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:44,119
Police arrived later
that day at the pleading

234
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:46,034
from friends and
family of Cameron,

235
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:48,427
but they were not
able to find a thing,

236
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,908
not a trace of Cameron.
- Well, I'm sorry.

237
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:54,129
This video doesn't show
anything happening to Cameron.

238
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:55,695
I think you want people to think

239
00:14:55,739 --> 00:14:56,957
there's something
dangerous inside

240
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:58,959
so that you can sell more DVDs.

241
00:14:59,003 --> 00:15:01,658
All you've done is
given this kid the idea

242
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,963
to sneak into private property.

243
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:04,704
- Try to prove it's all a hoax.

244
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,055
Prove it.

245
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:10,232
There's just too much you
can't explain and you know it.

246
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:11,624
Like where the hell do you think

247
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:13,626
I've been hiding
Diane all these years?

248
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:17,021
Where, I just kept
her in my basement?

249
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:18,109
She has family.

250
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,025
Do you really think
she would abandon them

251
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:23,680
just to sell her documentary?
- Well, I have to ask then,

252
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:26,335
Arnold, if you do think
everything was a hoax,

253
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,511
what do you conclude
happened to those people

254
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:30,904
who died on opening
night at Hell House?

255
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:34,734
- Well, we know that Alex
probably killed himself,

256
00:15:34,778 --> 00:15:38,260
Tony was in the basement
and was probably killed

257
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:40,436
during the mass panic
to get out after

258
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:42,873
the malfunction of some sort.

259
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:48,444
If this Mack were as
smart as he claimed to be,

260
00:15:49,706 --> 00:15:51,490
then he would've
killed himself too

261
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:55,146
because he was gonna wake
up to a pile of lawsuits

262
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,366
for negligent homicide.

263
00:15:57,409 --> 00:16:02,414
We know now that Sarah was the
smart one, she disappeared.

264
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:06,331
- Sarah wasn't afraid of
lawsuits, she wasn't even...

265
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:13,077
She

266
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:16,994
used Diane.
- How do you mean?

267
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:19,692
- Look, everything
about the hotel

268
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:21,346
goes back to Andrew Tully.

269
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,175
- Andrew Tully, the hotel's
owner who was accused

270
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:27,787
of performing Satanic rituals
in the basement and also

271
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:31,313
accused of being involved with
some guest disappearances.

272
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:34,272
- Yeah, the problem is
Andrew Tully is dead.

273
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:40,104
He hanged himself after the
hotel closed back in the 80s.

274
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:43,020
None, none of the
evil cult activity

275
00:16:43,063 --> 00:16:44,717
was actually ever proven.

276
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:50,636
- Well when
should I ask my question?

277
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,943
- Wait until you
hear me bring up the basement.

278
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:55,032
- So you'll say,
"It's in the basement."

279
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:57,991
And I'll ask something
like, "How do you know

280
00:16:58,035 --> 00:17:00,429
"that it's in the basement?"
- Right.

281
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,041
On me.

282
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:06,522
Hi, I'm Jessica Fox,
it's October seventh

283
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:08,872
and I'm here with Molly Reynolds

284
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:10,003
and David Morris.
- Yo.

285
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:12,658
- And with us is
Mitchell Cavanaugh.

286
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:16,488
- What are you guys, some sort
of an investigative outfit?

287
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:18,925
Like a boutique
Vice or 60 Minutes?

288
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:22,451
- Yeah, but unlike other
journalists, we film every part

289
00:17:22,494 --> 00:17:24,975
of our story from inception
through publication.

290
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:26,542
And we're totally transparent,

291
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:28,196
everything is released
once we publish.

292
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:30,328
- Jess has
me record everything,

293
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:31,634
I don't stop rolling.

294
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:33,723
I go to the can,
this goes with me.

295
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:35,725
- That's
great but I...

296
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:48,694
- The hotel is like
a maze and of course

297
00:17:48,738 --> 00:17:51,001
that's not by accident,
Tully designed it

298
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:54,091
based on H.H. Holmes'
murder house, I've heard.

299
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:56,528
So he made it as hard as
possible to find your way out

300
00:17:56,572 --> 00:17:57,834
in the middle of the night.

301
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,010
And we need to find our
way to the basement.

302
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:02,752
- But how do you know
what we're looking for

303
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:05,015
is in the basement?
- That's a good question,

304
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:07,931
Molly, everything that Tully
wanted to keep a secret

305
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:10,150
was kept in the basement,
so we're talking about

306
00:18:10,194 --> 00:18:13,545
proof of cult activity
and information about

307
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:15,199
the missing guests,
it's all there.

308
00:18:15,243 --> 00:18:18,071
- You had no proof when
you called into the show,

309
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:21,336
you just knew how to find it?

310
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:25,209
And that's what you
needed me for, right?

311
00:18:25,253 --> 00:18:26,819
- Right.

312
00:18:26,863 --> 00:18:30,649
- How do you even know that
this supposed evidence exists?

313
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,303
- Because of one
flipped witness.

314
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:34,436
That's all it took and
I have the transcript.

315
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:36,264
- Who flipped and
why don't we know about it?

316
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:39,136
- Because once Tully
and his cult members

317
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,007
committed suicide, the
whole thing got dropped,

318
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:42,705
everything, it just disappeared.

319
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,576
But this guy,

320
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,056
Patrick Carmichael,

321
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:49,581
he worked at the hotel, he
was a member of Tully's cult

322
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,322
but he was arrested on a
separate assault charge

323
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:53,411
so he missed the suicide party.

324
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:54,369
He says

325
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,024
that Tully kept video footage

326
00:18:58,068 --> 00:19:00,505
and photos of what was
happening at the hotel.

327
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:04,117
And then here, he says it
was kept in the fridges.

328
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:05,118
- What fridges?

329
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:07,164
Nobody searched the fridges?

330
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:10,298
- Yes but what if they assumed
he meant the kitchen fridges?

331
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:12,430
- The cops only searched
the kitchen fridges

332
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:13,692
but not the one in the basement

333
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,652
which I think, with
all due respect,

334
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:19,002
it is a ridiculous theory.

335
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:21,265
- We're dealing with a police
force that hasn't been able

336
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:23,398
to solve a series
of disappearances

337
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:25,095
for decades in the same place.

338
00:19:25,138 --> 00:19:27,315
- Okay, so what is the plan?

339
00:19:27,358 --> 00:19:31,057
We go into the basement,
search the fridge

340
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:33,451
and find the evidence.
- Yes.

341
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:35,061
I don't believe in ghost stories

342
00:19:35,105 --> 00:19:36,802
but I don't wanna take
any chances with you guys,

343
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:39,065
we're gonna be in and
out in an hour, tops.

344
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:41,329
If Mitchell is with us,
we'll be even quicker

345
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:43,722
because he knows the
hotel better than anyone.

346
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,423
- That's a really fucked up
place to try to break into.

347
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:50,816
You know that, right?
- Yes.

348
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,861
Mitchell, we
absolutely know that.

349
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:53,515
The evidence is there.

350
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:57,301
I know it, it has to be.

351
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:59,129
Okay, and if we
find it then maybe

352
00:19:59,172 --> 00:20:01,174
we will find out what
happened to Diane.

353
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:02,785
Finally.

354
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:05,701
Don't you wanna know?

355
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:13,970
We can't do this without you.

356
00:20:18,104 --> 00:20:20,542
- Will you turn
that off, please?

357
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:23,153
- Jess?
- Yep, turn it off.

358
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:24,415
- I'd like to share
with our audience

359
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:27,592
some of the stranger
unexplained occurrences

360
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:30,987
that have been recorded
since the documentary aired

361
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,381
in what many refer to as
the Hell House fallout.

362
00:20:33,424 --> 00:20:36,253
- So people believe
that this stuff is real?

363
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:39,082
- Well, nothing's been
proven either way yet.

364
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,433
- Look, as long as that
hotel emits this kinetic

365
00:20:42,477 --> 00:20:45,305
spiritual energy, people
are going to continue

366
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:47,395
to be drawn to it,
which is precisely why

367
00:20:47,438 --> 00:20:50,659
someone like me is invaluable
to the investigation.

368
00:20:50,702 --> 00:20:53,096
I need to be allowed
in that hotel.

369
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:54,706
I need access to it.

370
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,753
- Let's hold off on commenting
until we've seen the footage.

371
00:20:57,796 --> 00:20:58,536
Go ahead.

372
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:13,290
- All right, Ben,
challenge accepted.

373
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,247
I'm goin' in.

374
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:17,947
All right, coast
is clear, no cops.

375
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:23,953
Holy shit.

376
00:21:58,814 --> 00:22:01,817
All right, I think
that's far enough.

377
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,992
Challenge completed.

378
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:09,389
Get ready to pay up, Ben.

379
00:22:20,444 --> 00:22:21,619
Holy shit.

380
00:22:21,663 --> 00:22:22,664
- I haven't
seen Paul around

381
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:25,362
in a few days, is he okay?

382
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:27,016
- Holy shit.

383
00:22:37,853 --> 00:22:39,332
Oh shit!

384
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:47,384
- Hey guys, so we just got
back from our fashion show,

385
00:22:47,427 --> 00:22:48,298
was kinda disappointed

386
00:22:49,517 --> 00:22:51,040
we came from such
a faraway place

387
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,216
just to see a thrift shop.

388
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:55,740
I was expecting some
sort of high end

389
00:22:55,784 --> 00:22:58,526
awesome, amazing fashion line.
- Hey, Nate, sorry.

390
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:01,006
Is that girl hitchhiking?

391
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,486
- Babe who hitchhikes anymore?
- I don't know, come on,

392
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,880
it's so shitty out,
let's pick her up.

393
00:23:04,923 --> 00:23:05,968
- Fine, okay, fine.

394
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,368
Honey, do you need a ride?

395
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,589
Do you think we should do this?

396
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:21,331
- Yeah, it too cold out.
- Come on, she might--

397
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:22,201
- Oh, hey.

398
00:23:23,507 --> 00:23:24,552
- Hi, sweetie.

399
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:25,770
- How's it going?

400
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:28,904
- Where you
headed sweetie?

401
00:23:28,947 --> 00:23:30,383
- The Abaddon Hotel.

402
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:33,561
- The Abaddon Hotel, honey,

403
00:23:33,604 --> 00:23:35,998
that place has been closed
for a few years now.

404
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,696
- I checked in already.

405
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:42,265
- Okay, when did you check in?

406
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:44,572
- October eighth.

407
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,097
- It's September 30th.

408
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,621
- Let's just
get her home, okay?

409
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:52,667
- Fine, we're going.

410
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:56,584
- I'm sorry,
are you okay?

411
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:57,846
You just, you look
a little pale.

412
00:23:57,889 --> 00:24:00,544
Do you need some
water or something?

413
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:04,200
- Not so talkative, huh?

414
00:24:05,723 --> 00:24:07,203
I guess I wouldn't be
either if I was stuck

415
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,944
on the side of the
road in the cold.

416
00:24:15,515 --> 00:24:17,909
I think this is it.
- It's all boarded up.

417
00:24:17,953 --> 00:24:20,042
- I know, this
doesn't look right.

418
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:22,131
- Miss, is this where
you wanted us to drop you?

419
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:23,654
- Does this place
look familiar to you?

420
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:24,568
- Hold on, miss.
- Hold on, wait,

421
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:26,091
please don't get out of the car!

422
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:26,962
- This place is
boarded up, I'm not letting

423
00:24:27,005 --> 00:24:28,050
her go in there.
- I know!

424
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:29,094
- Hold on.
- Babe, wait, hold on.

425
00:24:29,138 --> 00:24:29,921
- Miss?

426
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:34,926
Miss, do you need some
help or something?

427
00:24:35,797 --> 00:24:37,276
She went in.

428
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,975
- Adam, I don't like this.
- I know, come on.

429
00:24:40,018 --> 00:24:41,324
- I don't think
she knows where she is.

430
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:43,456
- I know, she's...

431
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,632
- Sweetie?
- Hello?

432
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:48,984
Do you have a
flashlight or something?

433
00:24:49,027 --> 00:24:50,681
- Yeah.
- On your phone?

434
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:51,508
- Hello?

435
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,772
- Oh, there she
is, honey, can you?

436
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:57,253
- Adam, I don't think she--
- It's fine.

437
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:59,255
- I don't think this is her--
- Hold on.

438
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,082
Miss?

439
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,520
Hello?

440
00:25:03,563 --> 00:25:05,653
- Sweetie,
we just wanna help.

441
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:10,745
Oh my god.

442
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:11,615
- Miss.

443
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:14,531
- Adam, I
don't think we need

444
00:25:14,574 --> 00:25:16,098
to be here anymore.
- It's okay.

445
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,142
There's something
wrong with her.

446
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:18,100
Honey?
- I know, it's not--

447
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:19,405
- Listen!
- Worth it.

448
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- You shouldn't
be down here, okay?
Just come up with us
and we'll help you,
whatever you need, okay?
- So cold in here.

449
00:25:26,717 --> 00:25:28,110
- Oh fuck!
- Oh my god.

450
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:29,024
- Get outta here, go!
- Adam!

451
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:31,548
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!

452
00:26:15,244 --> 00:26:16,593
- And like, you've...

453
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:21,250
And so because I like him,
now I'm okay with the tattoos.

454
00:26:21,293 --> 00:26:23,252
- You say this like
it's an accomplishment.

455
00:26:23,295 --> 00:26:25,515
It's like, "Oh, I've never
dated a werewolf before."

456
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:30,085
- No, I used to hate
them and now I don't.

457
00:26:30,128 --> 00:26:32,914
- She comes from the town
from the movie Footloose,

458
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:34,002
it's real.
- Well...

459
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,832
- We go to meet
her parents, right?

460
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,878
And she grabs me and she's
like, "Just don't dance."

461
00:26:40,922 --> 00:26:42,358
- I did not say that!
- Wait, what?

462
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:43,620
What did she say?
- No dancing.

463
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:45,230
- I said nothing
to do with dance.

464
00:26:45,274 --> 00:26:47,537
I said, "Don't be weird."

465
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,801
- Is that better?
- You can always be weird

466
00:26:50,845 --> 00:26:52,368
in front of me.
- Okay.

467
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:54,587
- But in front of my parents?
- I feel a bout of weird.

468
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:56,328
- Oh no.
- Coming on, the dance floor.

469
00:26:56,372 --> 00:26:57,721
- Oh god.

470
00:26:57,765 --> 00:26:59,027
- Well, it's okay.
- Dance Commander coming out.

471
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,463
- Command that.
- This is really happening.

472
00:27:00,506 --> 00:27:02,030
- I know, yes.
- Jess, you can do

473
00:27:02,073 --> 00:27:03,640
whatever you want with
that because I don't care.

474
00:27:03,683 --> 00:27:05,555
- Oh, I'm not turning it off.

475
00:27:05,598 --> 00:27:07,383
I'm gonna use this.
- I don't work 'til tomorrow.

476
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:08,297
- Uh-huh.

477
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,646
You're gonna regret this.

478
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:34,802
You okay?

479
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:37,761
- What, yeah, yeah.

480
00:27:37,805 --> 00:27:38,980
- You look kinda sad.

481
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:41,634
- Nah, I'm fine.

482
00:27:43,071 --> 00:27:44,899
What are you hoping
to get outta this?

483
00:27:44,942 --> 00:27:46,683
What, are you just
looking to get

484
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:48,859
your niche company on the map?

485
00:27:48,903 --> 00:27:50,513
- Oh, I think we're
already on the map.

486
00:27:50,556 --> 00:27:52,080
- Oh, pardon me.

487
00:27:52,123 --> 00:27:53,733
- But this,

488
00:27:53,777 --> 00:27:57,476
this story, if I'm
honest, is like the most

489
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,870
interesting thing that's come
across my desk in a long time.

490
00:27:59,914 --> 00:28:01,176
- Otherwise you
wouldn't be out here

491
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:03,961
in the middle of nowhere
trying to sneak into a

492
00:28:04,005 --> 00:28:06,746
rumored haunted hotel.
- Mm-hmm.

493
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,748
Can I ask you something?

494
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:09,706
- Yeah, sure, shoot.

495
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:14,015
- What do you think really
happened to Sarah Happle?

496
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:17,801
I mean, you don't think you
interviewed a dead girl, right?

497
00:28:17,845 --> 00:28:19,585
You can't believe that.

498
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:25,722
- Let me answer that one for
you some other time when,

499
00:28:25,765 --> 00:28:28,029
when the camera's not on me.
- Oh, I can turn it off.

500
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:29,378
- Nah.

501
00:28:29,421 --> 00:28:32,163
What, and miss this,
are you kidding me?

502
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,253
- Oh no, oh no, it's begun.

503
00:28:38,648 --> 00:28:41,651
Wait, what do you think of
Brock Davies coming with us?

504
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,349
- I'm not thrilled by the idea.

505
00:28:44,393 --> 00:28:47,352
Wait, how does he even
know that we're doing this?

506
00:28:47,396 --> 00:28:49,398
I told him after the talk
show that there was no way

507
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:50,616
I was gonna go back
to the Abaddon.

508
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,444
- Okay, it's Brock,
he knows shit.

509
00:28:52,488 --> 00:28:53,706
- But it's--
- It's weird.

510
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,056
- No, it's a bad
idea is what it is.

511
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:57,797
- Okay, well, I told him
that, I said it's not--

512
00:28:57,841 --> 00:28:59,669
- And?
- Guess what he said.

513
00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:02,759
Do your best.
- Yeah, if you're looking

514
00:29:02,802 --> 00:29:05,675
for the secrets that
only ghosts keep,

515
00:29:05,718 --> 00:29:08,156
you need Brock Davies.
- Of course.

516
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,548
- Look, what doesn't
seem to be sinking in

517
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:11,594
with you or Brock is that

518
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:13,857
this is dangerous.

519
00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:18,253
The hotel is, look at me,
the hotel is dangerous.

520
00:29:18,296 --> 00:29:19,950
We have to be in and
out, we don't have time,

521
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:21,865
we can't wait for
Brock to be filming

522
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:24,085
his newest reality show.
- I hear you,

523
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:25,956
I agree, I told him that.

524
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,653
- Okay, but do you believe it?

525
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:30,700
- I have to see things
to believe them.

526
00:29:34,704 --> 00:29:35,748
- Well let's hope

527
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,622
that you'll still be a
skeptic at the end of this.

528
00:29:39,665 --> 00:29:41,145
- We're back!

529
00:29:41,189 --> 00:29:42,799
- Guys, I was roofied.

530
00:29:42,842 --> 00:29:44,714
- You what?
- No he was not!

531
00:29:44,757 --> 00:29:47,021
- By Molly?
- No, no.

532
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:48,674
- Doing shots, wow.
- She's taking advantage

533
00:29:48,718 --> 00:29:50,720
of you.
- Moved onto shots, guys.

534
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:52,896
- He got some shots.
- That's terrifying.

535
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,306
- Camera's up.
- Got spare batteries?

536
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:12,872
- Absolutely.
- Cards?

537
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:14,744
- Plenty.
- Are they clean?

538
00:30:14,787 --> 00:30:16,876
- They are
free of adult content.

539
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,443
- All right, just
keep the camera steady.

540
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:19,270
- Got ya.

541
00:30:21,229 --> 00:30:22,708
All right, tough guy,
what's the likelihood

542
00:30:22,752 --> 00:30:24,928
of us actually
getting in the back?

543
00:30:24,972 --> 00:30:26,712
- Well, that's the best way in.

544
00:30:26,756 --> 00:30:28,714
I know my way to
everywhere from there.

545
00:30:28,758 --> 00:30:30,890
I'll break that door down before
I look for an alternative.

546
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:32,153
- See, tough guy.

547
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:36,200
- Plus, nobody will
be able to see us

548
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:38,028
when we're in the back, right?
- Right.

549
00:30:38,072 --> 00:30:40,204
- Yeah.
- Right.

550
00:30:40,248 --> 00:30:41,379
- Molly, are you okay?

551
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:47,995
- I don't like going into
any Halloween haunted houses

552
00:30:49,257 --> 00:30:52,477
let alone ones that have been
abandoned for seven years.

553
00:30:52,521 --> 00:30:54,740
- Well if you're
uncomfortable right now,

554
00:30:54,784 --> 00:30:56,220
how are you gonna do inside?

555
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,226
- I'll be okay.

556
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:06,665
- Look, actually, Molly,
we need someone out here

557
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:09,842
to keep an eye on things.
- No, no, I will be fine

558
00:31:09,886 --> 00:31:11,844
in there, I'm just--
- But one of us,

559
00:31:11,888 --> 00:31:13,672
one of us needs to do
it, if the cops come

560
00:31:13,716 --> 00:31:15,805
we need to know where
they are, when they are,

561
00:31:15,848 --> 00:31:18,503
so it's, we need you out here.

562
00:31:18,547 --> 00:31:20,288
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.

563
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:22,072
We need someone.
- Yeah, but it's 8:15

564
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:23,856
and we gotta go because the
next shift is on its way.

565
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,075
- Okay.
- You got this?

566
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,511
- If you
think it's best, yeah.

567
00:31:26,555 --> 00:31:28,687
- We're on the walkies, okay?
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

568
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:30,907
- Look, we're
gonna be fine, okay?

569
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,387
Like it's gonna
be an hour, tops,

570
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,866
we're gonna steal us
some Abaddon goodies,

571
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,391
we're gonna shoot right
back out here to you.

572
00:31:36,434 --> 00:31:37,870
- Come on, man, let's move it.
- All right, I'm comin'.

573
00:31:37,914 --> 00:31:38,697
Bossy.

574
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:41,396
- Be careful.

575
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:51,797
- No dicking around, understand?

576
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:53,799
- Completely agree.

577
00:31:53,843 --> 00:31:57,847
- If I say drop whatever you're
doing and head for the exit,

578
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,762
you do exactly that.

579
00:31:59,805 --> 00:32:01,024
- We're on the same page.
- Do you think that

580
00:32:01,068 --> 00:32:02,591
we're gonna have a problem?
- No, no, no.

581
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:04,723
He's just saying that
on the off chance

582
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:06,247
that something goes
wrong, it's fine.

583
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:15,865
- If we're in any
kind of danger,

584
00:32:15,908 --> 00:32:17,258
you drop the camera and run.

585
00:32:18,824 --> 00:32:21,653
- No, no, no, we're not a
drop the camera and run group,

586
00:32:21,697 --> 00:32:23,699
we get everything, the
camera never goes off,

587
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,048
that is non negotiable.

588
00:32:27,137 --> 00:32:28,704
- Fine.

589
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,445
You just remember your way out.

590
00:32:46,243 --> 00:32:47,070
This one.

591
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:50,465
This is the door all the
tour goers fled out of.

592
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:55,600
- Ah, well, there's no lock.

593
00:32:56,993 --> 00:33:00,039
- All right, so
how do we get in now?

594
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:02,041
- Well it depends on
what kind of sys...

595
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:04,914
- Okay, I was not
expecting that.

596
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:07,917
- It makes sense.

597
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,399
- Hi.

598
00:33:11,442 --> 00:33:13,227
- We thought you were a no show.

599
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,012
- Are you kidding, I wouldn't
miss this for anything.

600
00:33:16,055 --> 00:33:18,493
This is my cameraman
and tech department

601
00:33:18,536 --> 00:33:20,756
all in one, Malcolm.
- Hey.

602
00:33:22,192 --> 00:33:23,933
Sorry, what makes sense?

603
00:33:23,976 --> 00:33:27,415
- The door being open,
they knew we were coming.

604
00:33:30,505 --> 00:33:33,247
- Okay, well, do you
think this is safe?

605
00:33:34,465 --> 00:33:37,120
- You know everything I
know about this place.

606
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:39,078
But that door being open
doesn't change anything for me.

607
00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:40,906
- I think it's a good sign.

608
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,778
The hotel wants to be heard.

609
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:44,040
It knows I can help.

610
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,434
Let's go in.

611
00:33:49,088 --> 00:33:50,612
- Okay.

612
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,398
- Do not stop rolling.
- You got it.

613
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:57,619
- Here we go.

614
00:33:59,142 --> 00:34:00,926
- Don't forget, the
hotel wants to be heard.

615
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:01,797
- Shut up.

616
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,408
- What the fuck is that?

617
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:23,688
- Ms. Fox, we're going
to record this conversation

618
00:34:23,732 --> 00:34:24,646
now if that's okay.

619
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:31,000
Can you tell us anything
you remember of how

620
00:34:31,043 --> 00:34:34,046
you wound up walking along on
the side of the road tonight?

621
00:34:37,224 --> 00:34:39,574
Do you remember anything
from the last few days?

622
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:44,666
Ms. Fox?

623
00:34:46,537 --> 00:34:48,496
You've been missing
for five days now.

624
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:52,195
Can you tell us anything
about where you've been

625
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,154
since last Sunday?

626
00:34:57,853 --> 00:34:58,636
Ms. Fox.

627
00:35:05,077 --> 00:35:06,209
- Lights out.

628
00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:18,265
- Brock, we're
splitting up right here,

629
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:20,310
the fastest way to the
dining room is that way,

630
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:21,616
fastest way to the
basement is that--

631
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:23,357
- Got it, we're
gonna go that way.

632
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:28,971
Oh, and if you hear any
noises, just ignore it.

633
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:30,973
I have a feeling this hotel

634
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:34,150
is going to be very
responsive to us.

635
00:35:35,282 --> 00:35:37,501
- Yeah, whatever, good luck.

636
00:35:37,545 --> 00:35:39,982
Just don't fuck around though.

637
00:35:40,025 --> 00:35:42,811
I still have no idea
what happened to Diane.

638
00:35:42,854 --> 00:35:45,161
- I think I'm gonna find
that out while I'm here.

639
00:35:46,902 --> 00:35:47,685
This way.

640
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:00,655
- Good creak
door, that's a good creak.

641
00:36:04,136 --> 00:36:05,355
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine,

642
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:07,052
just watch your
step in here, okay?

643
00:36:07,096 --> 00:36:09,272
- Fuck, man.
- Goddamn mess.

644
00:36:09,316 --> 00:36:10,665
Yeah, well they left in a rush.

645
00:36:12,144 --> 00:36:13,972
- That's
one way to put it.

646
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:17,193
- Yeah, just watch
out it's, step there.

647
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:21,240
- Fuck.
- Sorry.

648
00:36:25,941 --> 00:36:27,159
- Ugh.

649
00:36:29,248 --> 00:36:30,685
- Wait, what is that?

650
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:34,384
- It's
Latin, I think?

651
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:36,691
- What does it
mean, do you know?

652
00:36:36,734 --> 00:36:39,258
- Porta means door
but I don't know.

653
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:43,132
- I don't remember
that from the docu--

654
00:36:43,175 --> 00:36:45,177
- Dude, seriously,
we're not gonna talk about this?

655
00:36:45,221 --> 00:36:46,744
I mean, the big
harbinger of doom

656
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:47,876
on the walls.
- Wait, wait, wait.

657
00:36:50,705 --> 00:36:51,880
- What the fuck is that?

658
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,579
- Sarah?

659
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:11,247
- Let's
keep going on, come on.

660
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:16,121
- Not gonna lie, for a
haunted house company,

661
00:37:16,165 --> 00:37:19,603
nothing about this tour
seems especially spectacular.

662
00:37:19,647 --> 00:37:20,517
- You kidding?

663
00:37:20,561 --> 00:37:22,563
I heard it was a killer haunt.

664
00:37:23,912 --> 00:37:25,261
- Okay, seriously?

665
00:37:25,304 --> 00:37:27,263
How long have you been
waiting to say that line?

666
00:37:27,306 --> 00:37:29,134
- Had to wait
to get it on camera.

667
00:37:30,484 --> 00:37:31,659
- Oh, this is it.

668
00:37:37,752 --> 00:37:39,275
This is where it all went down.

669
00:37:41,364 --> 00:37:45,150
This is where Andrew
Tully and his followers

670
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:47,370
killed themselves.

671
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:50,721
Isn't that right, Tully?

672
00:37:53,594 --> 00:37:54,986
This is where it happened?

673
00:37:58,033 --> 00:37:59,426
- Whoa.

674
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:00,339
- Oh,

675
00:38:00,383 --> 00:38:01,428
kay.

676
00:38:02,254 --> 00:38:03,865
That's a little unsettling.

677
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,173
Were those there before?

678
00:38:09,436 --> 00:38:10,828
- Brock,
I don't think so.

679
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,748
- Then I guess we
should get to work.

680
00:38:19,446 --> 00:38:20,447
On me.

681
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:40,771
- That's it.

682
00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:48,039
- And we're
gonna go down there?

683
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:48,997
- Yep.
- David, you go first,

684
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,955
your light's the best.

685
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:53,218
- You've gotta be
shitting me right now, really?

686
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:54,306
- No.

687
00:38:56,831 --> 00:38:59,311
- Okay, okay, all
right, cool, I can do it.

688
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,401
- Just
watch your step.

689
00:39:06,362 --> 00:39:07,494
- That's
awesome, guys, thank you.

690
00:39:07,537 --> 00:39:09,321
Sacrificial lamb and
all, that's great.

691
00:39:14,283 --> 00:39:16,415
Smells like shit down here!

692
00:39:20,898 --> 00:39:21,769
Oh fuck me.

693
00:39:23,466 --> 00:39:25,337
- Here we are.

694
00:39:27,557 --> 00:39:30,342
Right, so it should be
somewhere on the right.

695
00:39:30,386 --> 00:39:31,169
Somewhere.

696
00:39:34,259 --> 00:39:36,392
This one?

697
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:42,093
- Oh, no shit.

698
00:39:46,228 --> 00:39:49,013
Can you imagine being
chained up in that all day?

699
00:39:49,057 --> 00:39:50,493
- No.

700
00:39:50,537 --> 00:39:52,364
- Yeah,
let's not, let's not.

701
00:39:52,408 --> 00:39:54,410
- Jesus.
- Just don't look at them,

702
00:39:54,453 --> 00:39:55,803
just ignore them.

703
00:39:55,846 --> 00:39:58,066
They'll just freak you
out, here it is, this one.

704
00:40:01,373 --> 00:40:02,679
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

705
00:40:02,723 --> 00:40:04,681
- Here we go.

706
00:40:04,725 --> 00:40:06,553
Whoa, mother lode.

707
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:09,556
- It's gotta
be in here, right?

708
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,818
- What
else could it be?

709
00:40:10,861 --> 00:40:11,775
- I dunno,
maybe all this shit

710
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:13,560
just belongs to Hell House, man.

711
00:40:13,603 --> 00:40:14,604
- Why would
they bring all this shit

712
00:40:14,648 --> 00:40:15,953
all the way from the city?

713
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,607
- Gotta keep
your shit somewhere.

714
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:18,956
- Let's
just get to work,

715
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,870
everybody just grab a
box and start digging.

716
00:40:19,914 --> 00:40:21,611
- All right, don't stop filming,

717
00:40:21,655 --> 00:40:23,352
just set the camera
down somewhere.

718
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:25,659
Mitchell, you should film too.

719
00:40:25,702 --> 00:40:27,399
- Filming
famous last words.

720
00:40:29,532 --> 00:40:31,795
- The reason we've
decided to commune here

721
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,623
in the dining room is because

722
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:37,322
this is where Tully's
cult committed suicide

723
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:40,543
en masse nearly 30 years ago.

724
00:40:40,587 --> 00:40:42,763
Usually the strongest
source for spiritual energy

725
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:45,069
is the last place the dead

726
00:40:45,113 --> 00:40:48,159
had contact with
the living world.

727
00:40:48,203 --> 00:40:51,423
My planchette will help us
get unanswered questions

728
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:54,513
from any presence
here left unseen.

729
00:40:56,341 --> 00:40:57,212
Andrew Tully,

730
00:40:58,648 --> 00:41:02,478
this is your house, we
only want to ask questions.

731
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:03,522
We are guests.

732
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:08,397
Andrew Tully, are
you here with us now?

733
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:15,056
Not Tully.

734
00:41:16,623 --> 00:41:19,408
Are you a member of
Tully's group then

735
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:20,583
here at the hotel?

736
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:25,806
Not a member of the cult either.

737
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:28,460
Are you a member of Hell House?

738
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:33,944
Are you one of the people
who've gone disappearing

739
00:41:33,988 --> 00:41:35,598
since the opening of this hotel?

740
00:41:37,774 --> 00:41:39,646
Spirit, are you lying to me?

741
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:45,695
Spirit, do you
have anything to do

742
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:48,393
with the disappearance
of Diane Graves,

743
00:41:48,437 --> 00:41:51,570
Jackson Mallet or any of
the people of Hell House?

744
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:56,880
- Whoa, let's settle
down a little bit, Brock.

745
00:41:56,924 --> 00:41:57,838
- Spirit,

746
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
do you intend to do any harm
to anyone here in the hotel?
Spirit will, oh shit!
- What the fuck is that?

747
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
- Okay, we're leaving,
we're leaving.
We don't want anything,
we are going right now.
- Brock, let's
get the fuck outta here.
- Go, go, go, go!

748
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,668
- There ya go.
- What is this?

749
00:42:54,503 --> 00:42:56,505
Okay, I think I have some

750
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:00,639
hotel blueprints, maybe?

751
00:43:00,683 --> 00:43:03,817
Some sketches.
- It could be important.

752
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,732
- The
layout of the place.

753
00:43:07,255 --> 00:43:09,213
- All right.

754
00:43:09,257 --> 00:43:09,953
- Ugh.

755
00:43:12,086 --> 00:43:13,609
Well, they definitely have rats.

756
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:18,179
Gross.

757
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,532
- God,
it's dusty, fuck.

758
00:43:28,015 --> 00:43:29,494
Don't know what it is.

759
00:43:29,538 --> 00:43:31,453
Lot of shit down here.

760
00:43:31,496 --> 00:43:33,977
- Hey, were you guys aware

761
00:43:34,021 --> 00:43:36,588
that they have whole
steamed lobster

762
00:43:36,632 --> 00:43:39,722
and a whole range of
items but no nachos?

763
00:43:40,941 --> 00:43:43,030
- Some people like
real food, David.

764
00:43:43,073 --> 00:43:45,336
- Nachos are real
food and I love them.

765
00:43:46,685 --> 00:43:48,949
- Can you focus?
- I am focused on the nachos

766
00:43:48,992 --> 00:43:50,864
that I'm eventually
going to put in my belly.

767
00:43:50,907 --> 00:43:52,169
- All right, well,

768
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,823
we'll get you some
as soon as we leave.

769
00:43:53,867 --> 00:43:55,564
- Awesome.

770
00:43:55,607 --> 00:43:58,872
Even more awesome,
I found tapes.

771
00:43:58,915 --> 00:43:59,829
- What?

772
00:43:59,873 --> 00:44:01,962
- All right, Abaddon Hotel,

773
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:03,790
From Construction to Completion.

774
00:44:05,356 --> 00:44:07,837
Tully made a documentary.
- That's good, that's good.

775
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:09,708
Yes.
- All right.

776
00:44:09,752 --> 00:44:11,972
- All right,
that's a keeper for sure.

777
00:44:12,015 --> 00:44:14,713
- Spooky.
- I've got a tape too.

778
00:44:14,757 --> 00:44:16,890
This could be interesting,
it says, it's labeled

779
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:19,588
"Unaired Commercial."
- Huh, we'll take it.

780
00:44:19,631 --> 00:44:21,590
Take them all, I mean, if it
looks remotely interesting

781
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:23,810
we should keep it.

782
00:44:23,853 --> 00:44:25,333
- What the?

783
00:44:25,376 --> 00:44:27,465
- Guys, I'm
here, where are you?

784
00:44:27,509 --> 00:44:29,859
- What the fuck?
- Molly, why?

785
00:44:29,903 --> 00:44:33,645
That sounds like Molly.
- I think it was.

786
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:34,733
- Yo, Molly, is that you?

787
00:44:36,431 --> 00:44:38,563
- Yeah, I'm upstairs.

788
00:44:38,607 --> 00:44:40,348
- She's in, why is she inside?

789
00:44:40,391 --> 00:44:43,655
- Why are you inside when
you're supposed to be outside?

790
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:48,617
- What, I am at
the main entranceway,

791
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,140
what the hell?

792
00:44:50,184 --> 00:44:51,794
- If she's at the
main entranceway,

793
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:54,797
just go get her and ask her
what the hell she's doing.

794
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:57,060
- I get nominated again.
- Okay, if it's the cops

795
00:44:57,104 --> 00:44:59,889
just tell her to stay
calm, lay low, it's fine.

796
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:00,847
- Cops, okay.

797
00:45:01,978 --> 00:45:03,284
All right, I'm
leaving this here.

798
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:04,111
- Is that too hard?
- All right, Molly,

799
00:45:04,154 --> 00:45:05,068
I'm on my way.

800
00:45:06,678 --> 00:45:08,767
Hold on to this, in case we
need to get ahold of you guys.

801
00:45:08,811 --> 00:45:09,986
- Just--

802
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,118
- I just don't
want to get shot.

803
00:45:11,161 --> 00:45:12,293
- Just keep her
where she is, okay?

804
00:45:12,336 --> 00:45:14,077
It's not a big deal,
it's just fucking,

805
00:45:15,644 --> 00:45:16,950
you're not gonna get shot.

806
00:45:19,866 --> 00:45:22,651
- Fuck, Molly.
- Oh my god, you scared me!

807
00:45:22,694 --> 00:45:24,696
What's going on?
- Look, I'm sorry,

808
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,003
but what are you doing in here?

809
00:45:27,047 --> 00:45:28,700
- What are you talking about?

810
00:45:28,744 --> 00:45:31,007
- Look, Jessica
told you to stay outside.

811
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:34,315
- I know, so why did you tell
me to come inside this door?

812
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:35,664
- Me?
- Yeah.

813
00:45:35,707 --> 00:45:37,100
- I didn't
tell you anything.

814
00:45:37,144 --> 00:45:38,710
- You didn't radio me and
tell me to come inside?

815
00:45:38,754 --> 00:45:40,843
Yeah, you did, David.
- No, I've been down

816
00:45:40,887 --> 00:45:43,933
in the basement digging
through like tapes from 1986,

817
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:46,936
I didn't tell you anything,
I haven't even touched that

818
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,765
until you called.
- You went on the radio

819
00:45:49,808 --> 00:45:51,898
and you said, "Hey,
Molly, we could use

820
00:45:51,941 --> 00:45:55,162
"some extra hands in here,
why don't you come inside

821
00:45:55,205 --> 00:45:56,685
"and I'll open up the front
door and meet you there."

822
00:45:56,728 --> 00:45:59,731
It was you, why are you screwing
with me, this is not okay!

823
00:45:59,775 --> 00:46:02,125
- Look, look, Molly--
- Stop, I'm not kidding!

824
00:46:02,169 --> 00:46:03,692
Why would you do this to me now?

825
00:46:03,735 --> 00:46:05,346
This is bullshit!
- I didn't do any of that,

826
00:46:05,389 --> 00:46:07,522
I wouldn't do that, let me see.

827
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:09,524
Just let me see this, okay?

828
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:11,221
I'm gonna call.
- It's not funny.

829
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,795
- Hey guys, something
very weird is going on here.

830
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:23,668
- David, are you there?

831
00:46:23,712 --> 00:46:24,756
Are you with Molly?

832
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:26,628
What's happening?

833
00:46:28,412 --> 00:46:31,285
- Yeah, I'm with her,
she said that I called her

834
00:46:31,328 --> 00:46:32,590
and told her to come in.

835
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:34,766
- What do you mean
you called her?

836
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:36,116
We told her to stay outside.

837
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:40,120
- David, listen, what
door did she come in?

838
00:46:41,817 --> 00:46:43,819
- She came in through
the front door, the tour door.

839
00:46:43,862 --> 00:46:45,734
- And the door she
used, is it closed?

840
00:46:47,562 --> 00:46:48,911
- Oh yeah, it's closed.

841
00:46:48,955 --> 00:46:49,825
- Can you open it?

842
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:56,832
- No, it's
locked, I don't--

843
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:58,834
- All right, we're
coming up right now.

844
00:47:00,096 --> 00:47:01,706
Just grab whatever you can,
we've gotta go right now.

845
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,056
- Wait, what's
happening, what's wrong?

846
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:05,884
- She wasn't supposed
to be in here, get it?

847
00:47:05,928 --> 00:47:07,712
Just go, let's just
go, just move, move.

848
00:47:07,756 --> 00:47:09,062
- We're fine,
nothing's happened.

849
00:47:09,105 --> 00:47:10,324
Calm down, Mitchell, it's fine.

850
00:47:10,367 --> 00:47:12,239
- Jessica, this was
a mistake, okay?

851
00:47:12,282 --> 00:47:15,416
There's something
definitely wrong about this.

852
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:17,461
- I don't understand, you
just need to calm down

853
00:47:17,505 --> 00:47:18,245
it's fine.
- Just think about it,

854
00:47:18,288 --> 00:47:19,986
think about it.

855
00:47:20,029 --> 00:47:22,901
Just how did you happen
to get the evidence?

856
00:47:22,945 --> 00:47:24,860
Someone knew that it
was gonna draw us here

857
00:47:24,903 --> 00:47:26,166
and it did, it worked.

858
00:47:27,384 --> 00:47:28,733
Fuck, let's go, let's
go, let's go right now.

859
00:47:28,777 --> 00:47:30,039
- Okay, okay, I'm moving.

860
00:47:32,955 --> 00:47:34,391
Okay.
- Just forget about the rest,

861
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:35,653
let's just go.

862
00:47:35,697 --> 00:47:36,567
- Can you
just calm down a second?

863
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:37,742
- I am, I'm very calm, let's go.

864
00:47:37,786 --> 00:47:39,222
- Yeah, right, okay.

865
00:47:41,703 --> 00:47:44,358
- What's taking so long?
- They'll be here, I promise.

866
00:47:44,401 --> 00:47:45,185
See!

867
00:47:50,973 --> 00:47:52,931
- Shit.
- Yeah, see?

868
00:47:52,975 --> 00:47:56,239
Tight, now seriously,
guys, who contacted her?

869
00:47:56,283 --> 00:47:57,893
- Nobody did.
- Exactly, that's why

870
00:47:57,936 --> 00:47:59,547
we gotta get outta
here right now.

871
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,331
We've gotta go back the way
we came, I wedged that open.

872
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:03,072
- Wait, what about Brock?

873
00:48:03,116 --> 00:48:04,943
- Yeah, I kinda
forgot Brock was here.

874
00:48:04,987 --> 00:48:06,989
- Fine,
we'll go that way,

875
00:48:07,033 --> 00:48:08,817
it goes to the dining
room and then to the exit.

876
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,079
- Calm down, okay?

877
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:14,910
- Jesus Christ.

878
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,393
Is that one working?
- Fuck!

879
00:48:23,005 --> 00:48:25,094
Come on!
- Just calm down,

880
00:48:25,138 --> 00:48:27,096
just keep going.

881
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:30,752
- Here we
go, come on, come on.

882
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,021
Ugh, this is nasty.

883
00:48:46,811 --> 00:48:47,595
- What?

884
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,988
- What?

885
00:48:57,431 --> 00:48:58,954
- Oh no.

886
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,656
- Shit, is
that Brock and Malcolm?

887
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,354
- What the
fuck is happening?

888
00:49:07,397 --> 00:49:09,617
- This way's the fastest
way to the exit, go!

889
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,487
- Go!
- Go!

890
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:11,532
- Just go!
- Just go, okay!

891
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:12,576
Go!
- Go, go!

892
00:49:14,187 --> 00:49:15,666
- Let's go.
- Where's the exit, man?

893
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:16,493
Come on.

894
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:28,897
- Jesus Christ
how did that get there?

895
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,551
- Oh my god!
- Fuck, how is that there?

896
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:32,118
That was in the basement.

897
00:49:32,161 --> 00:49:34,032
- That's our way out, we
gotta go out that way.

898
00:49:34,076 --> 00:49:35,164
- I'm not going
near that fucking thing.

899
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:36,905
- Oh shit, man.
- It's just a prop.

900
00:49:36,948 --> 00:49:39,864
- How did it get up here?
- It can't hurt us.

901
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It doesn't move.
Okay, let's go.

902
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh fuck!
All right, no.
- Come on guys, move move!

903
00:49:52,007 --> 00:49:53,443
Fuck!

904
00:49:53,487 --> 00:49:55,619
- No, no!

905
00:49:55,663 --> 00:49:56,968
- Go, Molly, go!

906
00:49:58,622 --> 00:49:59,928
Go, Molly, come on!

907
00:49:59,971 --> 00:50:02,539
Fuck!

908
00:50:03,453 --> 00:50:05,325
What is that?

909
00:50:05,368 --> 00:50:08,763
- Go, go, go!
- I don't understand.

910
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:10,330
- I don't wanna be in here.

911
00:50:10,373 --> 00:50:13,159
Please get me out of here.
- Come on, Mitchell, come on.

912
00:50:13,202 --> 00:50:14,899
- Mitchell!
- Come on!

913
00:50:14,943 --> 00:50:16,858
- The
door, there's no knob!

914
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:18,120
- What do you mean
there's no fucking knob?

915
00:50:18,164 --> 00:50:19,774
- There's no knob!
- All right, all right.

916
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:22,168
Jess, I've got an
idea, we break it down.

917
00:50:22,211 --> 00:50:24,822
- With what?
- With ourselves.

918
00:50:24,866 --> 00:50:26,694
Don't stop filming!

919
00:50:26,737 --> 00:50:27,521
We got this.

920
00:50:30,263 --> 00:50:31,394
Fuck, that sucks.

921
00:50:31,438 --> 00:50:34,005
Yeah, I'm good.

922
00:50:34,049 --> 00:50:35,181
What is that?

923
00:50:37,313 --> 00:50:38,662
The fuck, okay.

924
00:50:40,229 --> 00:50:41,099
What is that?

925
00:50:41,143 --> 00:50:42,275
Jess, hand me the camera.

926
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:45,016
Okay, okay, okay.

927
00:51:04,949 --> 00:51:07,648
- Upstairs, let's go upstairs.

928
00:51:07,691 --> 00:51:10,128
Let's go upstairs.
- That's a good idea.

929
00:51:10,172 --> 00:51:12,609
Jess, Jess, we have
to go, come on,

930
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:15,177
we have to go, go, go, go!
- Okay.

931
00:51:15,221 --> 00:51:17,266
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on, come on, come on.

932
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,007
- Come on.
- Come on!

933
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,400
How are these lights on?

934
00:51:20,443 --> 00:51:21,488
The power's supposed to be out!

935
00:51:21,531 --> 00:51:22,750
- Stop!
- Just ignore them,

936
00:51:22,793 --> 00:51:25,013
just keep moving.

937
00:51:26,406 --> 00:51:27,450
Fuck.
- Jesus.

938
00:51:27,494 --> 00:51:29,060
You okay, you okay?
- Yeah.

939
00:51:35,502 --> 00:51:36,851
- Where the
fuck are we going?

940
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:39,201
Guys, guys, guys, guys, look.

941
00:51:39,245 --> 00:51:40,594
Look, we can't go up there.

942
00:51:40,637 --> 00:51:41,899
- Why the fuck not?

943
00:51:41,943 --> 00:51:43,510
- Because I
saw your documentary.

944
00:51:43,553 --> 00:51:46,556
- Where else is there to go?
- Look, this is the only way.

945
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,384
- Okay.
- Go, go.

946
00:51:52,867 --> 00:51:54,651
- What, is there
something wrong with this room?

947
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:58,220
- Oh my god, Mitchell,
Mitchell, are you okay?

948
00:51:58,264 --> 00:51:59,308
- I have to go in there.
- No.

949
00:51:59,352 --> 00:52:00,266
- I have to go.
- You can't.

950
00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:01,876
You can't go in there.

951
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:05,445
No, no, no, Mitchell, Mitchell,
we have to get out of here!

952
00:52:05,488 --> 00:52:07,011
- Down there,
there's a way to the balcony.

953
00:52:07,055 --> 00:52:08,099
- Let's do
that then, okay?

954
00:52:08,143 --> 00:52:09,492
Come on man.
- Go.

955
00:52:09,536 --> 00:52:11,189
- No ruminating.

956
00:52:11,233 --> 00:52:13,235
No, no, no, no, no.

957
00:52:13,279 --> 00:52:14,628
No, guys, come on.

958
00:52:15,455 --> 00:52:17,021
This is not okay.

959
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
This is.
This is.

960
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,247
Oh my god!

961
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:28,250
Oh my fucking god,
oh my fucking god!

962
00:52:30,121 --> 00:52:31,949
Fuck, let's go in
here, let's go in here.

963
00:52:31,993 --> 00:52:33,777
Go, go, go, go!

964
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:36,302
- David!

965
00:52:36,345 --> 00:52:38,173
- Go, quick.

966
00:52:40,044 --> 00:52:41,176
- There's no lock,
there's no lock!

967
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:42,873
- Get me something.
- Here, hold it,

968
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:44,397
hold it, hold it, hold it shut.

969
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,528
Hold it shut.

970
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:49,532
Get out of the way.

971
00:52:55,886 --> 00:52:57,235
- Mitchell, Mitchell.

972
00:52:57,279 --> 00:52:59,281
You knew something was
wrong when you fucking heard

973
00:52:59,325 --> 00:53:01,065
Molly on the radio,
what is going on?

974
00:53:08,203 --> 00:53:09,683
- Let's talk a little
bit about Alex Taylor

975
00:53:09,726 --> 00:53:12,250
who's become a
controversial figure

976
00:53:12,294 --> 00:53:15,079
since the release of the
documentary and even before.

977
00:53:15,123 --> 00:53:17,299
Officials from Rockland
County and Abaddon say

978
00:53:17,343 --> 00:53:20,215
that he was never given
permission to use the hotel.

979
00:53:20,258 --> 00:53:21,521
- We didn't.

980
00:53:21,564 --> 00:53:23,436
You know, I remember
several instances where Alex

981
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:25,916
met with my colleagues and
they cautioned him away

982
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,918
from the hotel, gave
him other options.

983
00:53:27,962 --> 00:53:31,705
- They cautioned him against
or denied him access outright?

984
00:53:31,748 --> 00:53:33,837
- Well, legally speaking,

985
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:35,709
I don't think they were
allowed to forbid him

986
00:53:35,752 --> 00:53:38,929
from using the hotel, so no.

987
00:53:38,973 --> 00:53:40,409
- Brock, from what you've seen,

988
00:53:40,453 --> 00:53:43,456
have you been able to draw
any conclusions of your own?

989
00:53:43,499 --> 00:53:45,022
- Oh,

990
00:53:45,066 --> 00:53:45,806
for sure.

991
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:47,373
I mean, Alex

992
00:53:48,548 --> 00:53:50,767
has a certain personality
trait that's common

993
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,116
among people who
start with nothing

994
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,381
and create, build
their own businesses.

995
00:53:55,424 --> 00:53:58,427
They are willing to
take risks, they gamble.

996
00:53:58,471 --> 00:54:02,039
And when they lose
those gambles,

997
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:03,650
they are willing to double down

998
00:54:03,693 --> 00:54:06,392
and compound their risks.

999
00:54:06,435 --> 00:54:08,742
Things can spiral
out of control.

1000
00:54:08,785 --> 00:54:12,310
For Alex, things were definitely
spiraling out of control,

1001
00:54:12,354 --> 00:54:15,444
you could make the
argument that Hell House

1002
00:54:15,488 --> 00:54:17,359
was not doing well financially

1003
00:54:17,403 --> 00:54:19,840
and nobody else in the house
really knew about that,

1004
00:54:19,883 --> 00:54:22,146
well, maybe Mack, but

1005
00:54:22,973 --> 00:54:23,757
I think

1006
00:54:24,975 --> 00:54:27,325
something darker
was at play here,

1007
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:30,154
something more nefarious.

1008
00:54:30,198 --> 00:54:33,854
Something was driving him,
something compelling him

1009
00:54:33,897 --> 00:54:37,335
down a path toward his demise.

1010
00:54:37,379 --> 00:54:40,948
- Well that still
doesn't explain why

1011
00:54:40,991 --> 00:54:43,994
he chose the hotel
out of all the other

1012
00:54:44,038 --> 00:54:46,344
possible options
available to him.

1013
00:54:46,388 --> 00:54:47,258
- I have a theory.

1014
00:54:48,521 --> 00:54:49,652
I believe...

1015
00:54:53,221 --> 00:54:56,659
I believe he was
contacted by the hotel.

1016
00:54:56,703 --> 00:54:59,009
- How do you mean,
the hotel's been closed for--

1017
00:54:59,053 --> 00:55:00,968
- No, I don't mean someone
from the front desk

1018
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:03,013
called him to confirm
a reservation.

1019
00:55:03,057 --> 00:55:06,277
I believe there's something
within the hotel that...

1020
00:55:08,802 --> 00:55:10,630
Orchestrates events.

1021
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,724
A chain of events
that plays out like

1022
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:21,162
Almost like dominoes,
cause and effect.

1023
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,294
- What's the effect?

1024
00:55:32,652 --> 00:55:36,917
- Whatever happened on
October eighth, 2009.

1025
00:55:37,874 --> 00:55:39,485
It was set in motion

1026
00:55:40,442 --> 00:55:41,835
long before that night.

1027
00:55:53,237 --> 00:55:55,979
The leaked transcript,
how did you receive it?

1028
00:55:56,023 --> 00:55:57,328
- I got it in the mail.

1029
00:55:57,372 --> 00:55:59,592
- Any idea where it came from?

1030
00:55:59,635 --> 00:56:02,551
- No, it was anonymous.
- Exactly, so,

1031
00:56:02,595 --> 00:56:04,422
so you get an anonymous tip

1032
00:56:04,466 --> 00:56:06,990
and you contact me and then,

1033
00:56:07,034 --> 00:56:09,210
and then we get your crew here

1034
00:56:09,253 --> 00:56:11,429
and then in a few days
we're all trapped in here.

1035
00:56:11,473 --> 00:56:12,605
Don't you see?

1036
00:56:12,648 --> 00:56:13,823
So it was--
- So you thought this was

1037
00:56:13,867 --> 00:56:15,390
all manipulation, then
why did you let us--

1038
00:56:15,433 --> 00:56:16,826
- I didn't know,

1039
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:19,568
look, I--
- You should've stopped us!

1040
00:56:19,612 --> 00:56:20,917
- No, I honestly didn't think
that we were being baited

1041
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:22,702
until I heard Molly
on the radio, okay?

1042
00:56:22,745 --> 00:56:24,268
Why would I even go
in the hotel if I know

1043
00:56:24,312 --> 00:56:26,401
I was being baited?
- Okay, okay, we cannot--

1044
00:56:26,444 --> 00:56:28,229
- Fuck!
- We cannot stay here.

1045
00:56:28,272 --> 00:56:30,231
Mitchell, we need to go
and make a run for it.

1046
00:56:30,274 --> 00:56:31,188
We are sitting ducks!
- Did you not see

1047
00:56:31,232 --> 00:56:32,407
the same thing I saw out there?

1048
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,061
- Check your phone again.
- There's no--

1049
00:56:34,104 --> 00:56:35,715
- Just try.

1050
00:56:35,758 --> 00:56:39,370
- Try, I tried a million times,
there's no goddamn coverage.

1051
00:56:39,414 --> 00:56:40,720
I have nothing, okay,
look, I'm trying.

1052
00:56:40,763 --> 00:56:42,939
I'm trying, there's
nothing, nothing.

1053
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,767
There's nothing,
there's nothing, okay?

1054
00:56:44,811 --> 00:56:48,205
- Wait, wait, what
about the walkie?

1055
00:56:48,249 --> 00:56:49,076
Why don't we try a
different channel?

1056
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,904
We didn't try that yet.

1057
00:56:50,947 --> 00:56:52,427
Okay, okay, okay.

1058
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:53,471
- Maybe someone's gonna get it.

1059
00:56:53,515 --> 00:56:55,256
- Okay, okay.

1060
00:56:55,299 --> 00:56:57,345
Okay, okay.

1061
00:56:57,388 --> 00:56:58,302
Let me try it.

1062
00:56:58,346 --> 00:56:59,565
Okay, different channel.

1063
00:57:00,783 --> 00:57:02,219
Hello, can anyone
hear us, hello?

1064
00:57:03,699 --> 00:57:05,005
Fuck, okay.

1065
00:57:05,048 --> 00:57:07,660
Can anyone hear us, hello?

1066
00:57:07,703 --> 00:57:10,271
- Yes, yes,
I can hear you.

1067
00:57:10,314 --> 00:57:12,621
- Hello, we're stuck
in the Abaddon Hotel,

1068
00:57:12,665 --> 00:57:14,492
can you please help us, please!

1069
00:57:14,536 --> 00:57:17,408
- Yes, we have you
checked in for October eighth.

1070
00:57:17,452 --> 00:57:21,369
Just for you.

1071
00:57:21,412 --> 00:57:22,413
- Oh my god.

1072
00:57:28,594 --> 00:57:29,377
Fuck.

1073
00:57:31,074 --> 00:57:32,902
- Hey guys,

1074
00:57:32,946 --> 00:57:34,904
you're gonna want
to check this out.

1075
00:57:36,297 --> 00:57:37,994
Like I've been digging
through all these old,

1076
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:39,692
crusty-ass high eight tapes

1077
00:57:39,735 --> 00:57:41,737
and then I come across
a couple of these nice,

1078
00:57:41,781 --> 00:57:44,000
shiny, new mini-DV tapes

1079
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:46,481
and on one of 'em
you're not gonna believe

1080
00:57:46,524 --> 00:57:49,832
who pops up, like seriously,
get over here, get over here.

1081
00:57:49,876 --> 00:57:50,703
All right.

1082
00:57:53,662 --> 00:57:55,925
Boom, let me freeze frame it.

1083
00:57:55,969 --> 00:57:57,274
- What the,

1084
00:57:57,318 --> 00:57:58,232
what the fuck is he
doing on this tape?

1085
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:00,495
- Wait, wait, could their tapes

1086
00:58:00,538 --> 00:58:01,757
have gotten mixed
up with Tully's?

1087
00:58:01,801 --> 00:58:03,498
- No, no, no, no, these
are from the tapes

1088
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:04,760
that we found in
the basement, okay?

1089
00:58:04,804 --> 00:58:06,457
There is literally no
one else from Hell House

1090
00:58:06,501 --> 00:58:07,937
on these tapes.
- What are they saying?

1091
00:58:07,981 --> 00:58:09,373
Have you listened?
- They're having some kind

1092
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:10,940
of meeting, I can't
really tell yet.

1093
00:58:10,984 --> 00:58:12,594
- Who was meeting who?

1094
00:58:12,638 --> 00:58:17,207
- Alex and then someone else
that I haven't even seen yet.

1095
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:19,601
Like, okay, look at
the hard-coded date.

1096
00:58:19,645 --> 00:58:21,255
That's April, okay?

1097
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:23,518
That's six months before
the fucking tragedy.

1098
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:26,347
- Alex, he.
- Six months.

1099
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:27,522
- He'd always given
the impression that--

1100
00:58:27,565 --> 00:58:30,090
- That he had never
been there before.

1101
00:58:30,133 --> 00:58:31,439
- Right.

1102
00:58:31,482 --> 00:58:32,788
- Then what the fuck,
we have to watch this.

1103
00:58:32,832 --> 00:58:35,356
- All right, all right,
hold onto your butts.

1104
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:45,801
- And where the fuck
have you been, huh?

1105
00:58:45,845 --> 00:58:46,715
I've been calling you for weeks

1106
00:58:46,759 --> 00:58:48,151
and they go to voicemail.

1107
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:49,500
I can sue you, you know?

1108
00:58:49,544 --> 00:58:50,937
- You knew it was
high risk, I told you

1109
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,853
something like this could
happen, it was bad luck.

1110
00:58:53,896 --> 00:58:55,463
- Bad luck?

1111
00:58:55,506 --> 00:58:59,249
No, no, no, no, no, but I
lost a fortune on that, okay?

1112
00:58:59,293 --> 00:59:00,729
What the fuck am I
supposed to do now?

1113
00:59:00,773 --> 00:59:01,991
- What are
you supposed to do?

1114
00:59:02,035 --> 00:59:04,385
I don't know, Alex, take
some responsibility?

1115
00:59:04,428 --> 00:59:08,606
- No, no, no, no, you
reached out to me, okay?

1116
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:10,043
You called me, why
did you do that?

1117
00:59:10,086 --> 00:59:11,871
Were you trying to scam
me from the beginning?

1118
00:59:11,914 --> 00:59:13,655
- You're obviously
business savvy,

1119
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:16,440
Hell House is a huge success
in the highly-successful

1120
00:59:16,484 --> 00:59:18,486
Halloween market like New York.

1121
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:20,575
- Yeah, it was.

1122
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:23,491
It was.

1123
00:59:23,534 --> 00:59:24,405
- What do you mean was?

1124
00:59:24,448 --> 00:59:25,580
You've still got the business.

1125
00:59:27,582 --> 00:59:29,410
Alex, you didn't.

1126
00:59:30,716 --> 00:59:33,588
You invested the company's
money and not your own,

1127
00:59:33,631 --> 00:59:37,548
oh wow, did I have
you pegged so wrong.

1128
00:59:37,592 --> 00:59:40,029
That's some tough explaining
to your pal, Mack.

1129
00:59:40,073 --> 00:59:43,206
Say, Alex, where did
all our money go?

1130
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,601
Well, Mack, it's gone,
but on a brighter note,

1131
00:59:46,644 --> 00:59:49,952
Rockland County is really
lovely this time of year.

1132
00:59:49,996 --> 00:59:53,303
Wish I could be a fly
on the wall for that.

1133
00:59:53,347 --> 00:59:57,743
Relax, Alex, I think I
might be able to help you.

1134
00:59:57,786 --> 00:59:59,222
- How?

1135
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:01,311
- What do you
think of this place?

1136
01:00:01,355 --> 01:00:02,660
- This hotel?

1137
01:00:02,704 --> 01:00:05,141
It's a dump.
- Well, sure,

1138
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,404
it hasn't had guests
in a few decades,

1139
01:00:07,448 --> 01:00:08,884
but what do you think about it?

1140
01:00:11,582 --> 01:00:13,497
- I don't know,
it's kinda freaky.

1141
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:15,108
Easy to get lost.

1142
01:00:15,151 --> 01:00:17,371
I mean, who makes it that
hard to find a dining room?

1143
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:19,112
- Fun, right?

1144
01:00:19,155 --> 01:00:21,679
It's been in my possession
for a very long time

1145
01:00:21,723 --> 01:00:23,029
and I've been looking
to do something

1146
01:00:23,072 --> 01:00:24,770
to put it back on the map.

1147
01:00:26,423 --> 01:00:28,164
- Something like what?

1148
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,862
- An attraction
of some kind.

1149
01:00:30,863 --> 01:00:34,518
A haunted house, perhaps?

1150
01:00:34,562 --> 01:00:38,784
You could help me give
this hotel a second life.

1151
01:00:59,674 --> 01:01:02,720
- Are we all
gonna die in here?

1152
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:06,724
- Molly, no, no, no, no.

1153
01:01:06,768 --> 01:01:09,118
Just stay calm, we are
gonna figure this out

1154
01:01:09,162 --> 01:01:12,078
and then we're gonna get
out of here, I promise you.

1155
01:01:12,121 --> 01:01:12,905
Okay?

1156
01:01:15,908 --> 01:01:17,300
I didn't think.

1157
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:20,651
I didn't know.

1158
01:01:23,306 --> 01:01:24,220
There was

1159
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:27,180
so much blood.

1160
01:01:30,096 --> 01:01:31,358
- Whose blood?

1161
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:33,839
Where did you see the blood?

1162
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:36,145
His blood.

1163
01:01:40,497 --> 01:01:42,804
Her blood, my blood.

1164
01:01:47,722 --> 01:01:52,379
They laughed and laughed
and laughed and...

1165
01:02:20,581 --> 01:02:21,364
Do you know,

1166
01:02:22,888 --> 01:02:25,238
in the Bible they call
it the lake of fire.

1167
01:02:28,241 --> 01:02:30,025
- Can you tell
us who you were with?

1168
01:02:31,635 --> 01:02:33,507
Where have you been
the last few days?

1169
01:02:34,769 --> 01:02:37,076
- Just conserve your energy.
- For what?

1170
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:39,774
What's the plan?

1171
01:02:39,817 --> 01:02:40,601
I mean,

1172
01:02:41,863 --> 01:02:44,083
we have to make a run
for it, eventually,

1173
01:02:44,126 --> 01:02:46,085
I mean we have to, didn't
you say there was a balcony?

1174
01:02:46,128 --> 01:02:48,696
- Yes, yes, there is a
balcony, I saw it on the tapes.

1175
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:50,089
- Then that's where
we have to go.

1176
01:02:50,132 --> 01:02:52,004
- Yes, eventually,
just not right now.

1177
01:02:52,918 --> 01:02:54,223
You saw what's out there.

1178
01:02:56,704 --> 01:02:57,487
- Fine.

1179
01:02:58,488 --> 01:02:59,881
- If we get outta here,

1180
01:03:00,882 --> 01:03:02,014
I want a vacation.

1181
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:07,758
A whole week where
you don't get to call,

1182
01:03:07,802 --> 01:03:09,238
text or e-mail me

1183
01:03:10,283 --> 01:03:12,633
and I can just sit on the couch

1184
01:03:12,676 --> 01:03:15,723
and binge watch So You
Think You Can Dance.

1185
01:03:17,116 --> 01:03:18,465
Is that a deal?

1186
01:03:20,946 --> 01:03:22,730
- Yeah, it's a deal.

1187
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:37,963
I'm sorry.

1188
01:03:41,053 --> 01:03:41,967
- Shh, shh.

1189
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:48,799
- Sleep sweet.

1190
01:03:48,843 --> 01:03:50,671
Shit!

1191
01:03:50,714 --> 01:03:51,889
- Fuck.
- Who turned off the lights?

1192
01:03:51,933 --> 01:03:53,152
- David?
- Damn it!

1193
01:03:53,195 --> 01:03:55,937
- I can't,
where are you, David?

1194
01:03:55,981 --> 01:03:57,069
- I'm over
here by the camera.

1195
01:03:57,112 --> 01:03:58,331
- Who turned off the light?
- Okay.

1196
01:03:58,374 --> 01:03:59,985
- Just crawl
towards the sound.

1197
01:04:01,987 --> 01:04:04,641
Okay, okay, okay, I told you.
- What's wrong with it?

1198
01:04:04,685 --> 01:04:05,860
- There's nothing
this camera can do

1199
01:04:05,903 --> 01:04:07,383
that I can't fix.
- Come on!

1200
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:09,559
- I'm working, Jess, and...

1201
01:04:09,603 --> 01:04:10,734
- Come on.
- Boom!

1202
01:04:10,778 --> 01:04:11,866
Boom, got it.

1203
01:04:11,909 --> 01:04:12,954
Got it, see?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1204
01:04:12,998 --> 01:04:14,042
- What did it tell you, got it.

1205
01:04:14,086 --> 01:04:16,131
See, I told you.
- Okay.

1206
01:04:17,219 --> 01:04:18,351
What the fuck?

1207
01:04:18,394 --> 01:04:19,961
- What, what?
- Why is the door open?

1208
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:23,617
- More importantly,
where the fuck is Molly?

1209
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:24,792
- Molly?
- She wouldn't

1210
01:04:24,835 --> 01:04:27,055
just get up and
walk the fuck out!

1211
01:04:27,099 --> 01:04:28,404
- She wouldn't get
out of this room by herself.

1212
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:29,753
- Molly!
- Stop!

1213
01:04:29,797 --> 01:04:32,452
- Hey, Molly, come on!
- Stop, stop, stop.

1214
01:04:32,495 --> 01:04:33,757
- All right, all right.
- Listen.

1215
01:04:33,801 --> 01:04:35,150
I'm chill.
- We'll go get her.

1216
01:04:35,194 --> 01:04:36,760
We'll go get her.
- Jessica, tell him I'm chill!

1217
01:04:36,804 --> 01:04:38,458
- Okay, he's okay.
- Fine, you're chill,

1218
01:04:38,501 --> 01:04:40,242
you're chill, I get it.
- He's okay.

1219
01:04:40,286 --> 01:04:42,157
Okay, calm down.
- What is that?

1220
01:04:43,941 --> 01:04:46,031
That wasn't here before.

1221
01:04:50,861 --> 01:04:53,168
- Mitchell,
Mitchell, what is it?

1222
01:04:53,212 --> 01:04:54,996
- Mitchell?

1223
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:58,608
- What is it?

1224
01:05:00,045 --> 01:05:02,047
- Jessica,
what does it say?

1225
01:05:03,831 --> 01:05:05,398
- It says,

1226
01:05:05,441 --> 01:05:08,444
"Lovely Molly's in the
basement with her friends."

1227
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:09,880
- This basement,
the basement here?

1228
01:05:09,924 --> 01:05:11,056
- I don't know,
that's what it says!

1229
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:12,970
- No, come on!
- No, no, no.

1230
01:05:13,014 --> 01:05:15,408
David, stop it!
- Listen.

1231
01:05:15,451 --> 01:05:18,411
- We're gonna find her.
- I just want to get her back.

1232
01:05:18,454 --> 01:05:20,587
- Okay, we know, we all
want her back, just be calm.

1233
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:22,067
- I promise you we'll
go get her we just--

1234
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:25,592
- You promise me, Mitchell.
- Just don't, I promise,

1235
01:05:25,635 --> 01:05:27,768
I promise, just don't be
stupid about this, okay?

1236
01:05:27,811 --> 01:05:28,638
I'll go first

1237
01:05:29,813 --> 01:05:31,902
and Jessica, you go next

1238
01:05:31,946 --> 01:05:33,730
and then you get
our backs, okay?

1239
01:05:33,774 --> 01:05:35,036
- Okay, we're gonna get her.

1240
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:36,994
- Okay.

1241
01:05:37,952 --> 01:05:38,822
- We have to go slowly.
- Come on.

1242
01:05:38,866 --> 01:05:42,130
- Slowly, shh, be quiet.

1243
01:05:42,174 --> 01:05:43,914
- Going to the basement.

1244
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,743
Going to the basement.

1245
01:05:48,005 --> 01:05:49,268
We're going to the
fucking basement.

1246
01:06:00,235 --> 01:06:03,108
Watch your head, Jess.
- Okay, okay.

1247
01:06:19,211 --> 01:06:22,039
- It's clear,
it's clear, let's go.

1248
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:24,433
- Where are you?
- It's clear.

1249
01:06:24,477 --> 01:06:26,609
- Stay close, stay close.

1250
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,402
- What the fuck?

1251
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:39,970
How are these lights working?

1252
01:06:45,976 --> 01:06:47,761
- Let's go.

1253
01:07:09,565 --> 01:07:10,392
Okay, okay.

1254
01:07:16,964 --> 01:07:18,008
- Fuck.

1255
01:07:20,315 --> 01:07:21,186
- This way.

1256
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:32,153
- Do you see her?
- Shh, shh.

1257
01:07:52,086 --> 01:07:54,219
- What, what?

1258
01:07:57,178 --> 01:07:58,962
Oh my god!
- What, what?

1259
01:07:59,006 --> 01:08:01,791
- Keep it together,
Jess, just keep it together.

1260
01:08:01,835 --> 01:08:04,272
- Oh fuck, no, we
have to go and get her!

1261
01:08:04,316 --> 01:08:06,100
- No, no, no, David.
- Go get her now.

1262
01:08:06,143 --> 01:08:08,972
- Just be careful, we don't
know what the fuck is in here.

1263
01:08:09,016 --> 01:08:10,539
- Okay.
- Just take it easy.

1264
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:12,367
Just take it slow, I've got
your back but take it slow.

1265
01:08:12,411 --> 01:08:14,021
- All right.

1266
01:08:16,066 --> 01:08:17,459
Jess?
- Yes.

1267
01:08:17,503 --> 01:08:21,594
- Just take the camera.
- Okay, okay, I've got it.

1268
01:08:21,637 --> 01:08:22,421
Okay.

1269
01:08:24,379 --> 01:08:26,642
Come on, Mitchell,
let's do this.

1270
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,340
- Hold on.

1271
01:08:30,255 --> 01:08:31,081
You go slow.

1272
01:08:32,735 --> 01:08:34,259
I got your back but go slow.

1273
01:08:35,085 --> 01:08:36,304
- Molly.

1274
01:08:36,348 --> 01:08:37,871
Molly.

1275
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:38,785
- Easy.

1276
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:41,222
No sudden moves.

1277
01:08:42,267 --> 01:08:44,747
- Fuck, something's coming!
- Molly?

1278
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,358
- Mitchell,
Mitchell, hurry!

1279
01:08:46,401 --> 01:08:48,447
- Molly, I need you to get up.
- Hurry, hurry, it's coming.

1280
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Wake up now.
- Hurry, it's
coming, it's coming!
- Oh my god!

1281
01:08:59,588 --> 01:09:02,025
- Molly, come
on, you're all right,

1282
01:09:02,069 --> 01:09:03,331
we've gotta get you outta here!

1283
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:06,116
- Go, go, go,
go, get out, get out!

1284
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,204
- Go!
- Come on!

1285
01:09:07,248 --> 01:09:09,032
Come on, get out, now!

1286
01:09:09,076 --> 01:09:11,165
Go Jessica, go, go, go, go!

1287
01:09:18,433 --> 01:09:20,870
- Oh my god!
- David!

1288
01:09:20,914 --> 01:09:22,176
David!
- Get out of here!

1289
01:09:22,219 --> 01:09:23,264
Go, go!

1290
01:09:24,091 --> 01:09:26,702
Molly, where are you?

1291
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:27,529
Fuck.

1292
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,227
Oh my god, where are you?

1293
01:09:30,271 --> 01:09:31,403
I don't know how to get out.

1294
01:09:31,446 --> 01:09:33,796
Molly run, run, Molly, run!

1295
01:09:36,582 --> 01:09:38,932
Quick.
- Get the door.

1296
01:09:40,934 --> 01:09:42,196
Fucking open!

1297
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:44,198
- Stop it,
stop it, it's locked,

1298
01:09:44,241 --> 01:09:45,591
it's locked, fuck.

1299
01:09:47,027 --> 01:09:52,032
Molly, where are you?

1300
01:09:53,686 --> 01:09:54,861
- Oh my god!

1301
01:09:55,949 --> 01:09:59,082
- Stop, please, no!

1302
01:10:01,868 --> 01:10:03,565
Come here, where is it?

1303
01:10:03,609 --> 01:10:04,827
- Where is it?
- Do you see it?

1304
01:10:04,871 --> 01:10:05,654
Shh, shh.

1305
01:10:07,134 --> 01:10:08,222
Molly?

1306
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Where are you, Molly?
- I'm here.
- Look, where is it?

1307
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,236
- We have on the phone
right now Jessica Fox,

1308
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:26,240
Editor of the new
and controversial
website The Inside,

1309
01:10:26,283 --> 01:10:29,199
she'd like to weigh in on the
topic of the Abaddon Hotel.

1310
01:10:29,243 --> 01:10:30,940
Jessica, you're
on air, go ahead.

1311
01:10:30,984 --> 01:10:32,899
- Hi Suzy, thanks
for this opportunity,

1312
01:10:32,942 --> 01:10:35,510
I wanna start by saying--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

1313
01:10:35,554 --> 01:10:37,120
wait a minute, Jessica Fox?

1314
01:10:37,164 --> 01:10:38,731
You're the one that's
been writing about

1315
01:10:38,774 --> 01:10:40,994
the hotel recently, right?

1316
01:10:41,037 --> 01:10:43,126
Saying how you know for a fact

1317
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:45,259
that Tully was some
kind of boogey man

1318
01:10:45,302 --> 01:10:48,784
and that the town has been
complicit in some ways?

1319
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:51,178
This is why people
laugh at internet blogs,

1320
01:10:51,221 --> 01:10:54,268
lies under the guise of
journalism is fake news.

1321
01:10:54,311 --> 01:10:58,315
You had the chance to be the
next Buzzfeed but instead,

1322
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:00,796
you're chasing ghost stories
and it's gonna be your funeral

1323
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,407
because there's nothing--
- I have physical proof

1324
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:05,061
of Tully's involvement in the
disappearance of his guests,

1325
01:11:05,105 --> 01:11:07,237
the town's involvement
in the subsequent coverup

1326
01:11:07,281 --> 01:11:08,804
and the link to Hell House.

1327
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:11,459
- Then why aren't you
typing away in your Brooklyn

1328
01:11:11,503 --> 01:11:14,331
studio apartment instead
of calling in here?

1329
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:16,812
By all means, break
the case wide open.

1330
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:18,684
- I intend
to do just that.

1331
01:11:18,727 --> 01:11:19,989
If you're on the town's payroll,

1332
01:11:20,033 --> 01:11:21,904
I would resign right
now if I were you,

1333
01:11:21,948 --> 01:11:24,211
things are going to get very
messy for that little town.

1334
01:11:24,254 --> 01:11:26,213
- What is the purpose
of this call, really?

1335
01:11:26,256 --> 01:11:28,781
If you had proof, you
wouldn't be calling here

1336
01:11:28,824 --> 01:11:32,393
with empty, vague threats.
- Jessica, do you have proof?

1337
01:11:32,437 --> 01:11:34,439
Do you plan on revealing it?

1338
01:11:34,482 --> 01:11:36,397
- Mitchell, if you
want to know what happened

1339
01:11:36,441 --> 01:11:38,443
to Diane, then come and find me.

1340
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:45,188
- I'm not sure what
she was alluding to

1341
01:11:45,232 --> 01:11:48,365
but apparently she
knows where Diane is.

1342
01:11:48,409 --> 01:11:51,978
- This is what we run
into in our town, Suzy.

1343
01:11:52,021 --> 01:11:54,415
We have limited resources

1344
01:11:54,459 --> 01:11:56,765
but we have to spend
money that we don't have

1345
01:11:56,809 --> 01:12:01,204
guarding the hotel, defending
ourselves from slander from

1346
01:12:01,248 --> 01:12:05,557
Mitchell here and the
internet crazy Ms. Fox.

1347
01:12:59,785 --> 01:13:01,874
- Yeah, I'm just nervous.

1348
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,573
I don't know, Mom, it
just feels like Alex

1349
01:13:05,617 --> 01:13:08,445
is just, you know,
keeping something from us.

1350
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,840
Yeah, I know, once we
get through opening night

1351
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
it'll all be
downhill from there.
No, Mom, I already told
you, I'm dead already.
He took us to Hell and
Mitchell's coming with us.

1352
01:14:04,501 --> 01:14:06,808
- Look, we can talk about
this for days on end,

1353
01:14:08,288 --> 01:14:11,378
the only thing I can
assure the audience is that

1354
01:14:11,421 --> 01:14:14,511
I did nothing to
alter those tapes.

1355
01:14:14,555 --> 01:14:16,513
I think that the hotel
is very dangerous

1356
01:14:16,557 --> 01:14:19,125
and everyone should
stay away from it.

1357
01:14:19,168 --> 01:14:21,562
It's not a joke,

1358
01:14:21,606 --> 01:14:22,607
okay, this is real.

1359
01:14:24,391 --> 01:14:25,435
This is real.

1360
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:29,831
- Do you intend to
stay away from the hotel?

1361
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:47,980
- I do.

1362
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,029
Even though I wanna
know what happened

1363
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:57,642
just as much as anyone
else, probably more.

1364
01:14:59,121 --> 01:15:00,514
- Because of Diane?

1365
01:15:03,735 --> 01:15:04,518
- Yeah.

1366
01:15:09,523 --> 01:15:10,655
Yeah, because of Diane.

1367
01:15:15,268 --> 01:15:16,095
But also

1368
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:19,489
because of the genuine curiosity

1369
01:15:19,533 --> 01:15:22,797
that got me into documentary
filmmaking in the first place.

1370
01:15:24,581 --> 01:15:27,106
But I have no intention of
ever entering the Abaddon.

1371
01:15:28,455 --> 01:15:30,500
- Thank you, Mitchell.

1372
01:15:30,544 --> 01:15:33,373
You set a fine example
by saying that.

1373
01:15:34,635 --> 01:15:37,464
- Well, I think we'll
end on that positive note

1374
01:15:37,507 --> 01:15:38,900
and some agreement.

1375
01:15:38,944 --> 01:15:41,468
Thank you to my panel
for the lively debate

1376
01:15:41,511 --> 01:15:43,731
and thank you for
watching the show.

1377
01:15:43,775 --> 01:15:46,516
Next week we'll continue to
focus on the Abaddon Hotel

1378
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,997
and I'll be interviewing
wealthy tech entrepreneur

1379
01:15:49,041 --> 01:15:52,174
Russell Wynn, who claims
he's been receiving

1380
01:15:52,218 --> 01:15:55,743
anonymous packages
containing unseen video

1381
01:15:55,787 --> 01:15:57,571
from the Abaddon Hotel.

1382
01:15:57,614 --> 01:16:00,487
And he's been quietly
putting it all together.

1383
01:16:01,706 --> 01:16:04,578
And we'll hear about
that and his plans

1384
01:16:04,621 --> 01:16:09,104
to relocate his popular
site-specific play Insomnia.

1385
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:13,761
- And we're clear.

1386
01:16:17,069 --> 01:16:19,288
- Hey man, you
serious about that?

1387
01:16:19,332 --> 01:16:20,855
- About what?

1388
01:16:20,899 --> 01:16:22,727
- About not
going back to the hotel.

1389
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:24,990
- I think so, why?

1390
01:16:25,033 --> 01:16:27,688
- Because I know you're
lying to my face.

1391
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:31,692
You'll come back and if you're
trying to get to the secrets

1392
01:16:31,736 --> 01:16:35,087
that only ghosts keep,
you need Brock Davies.

1393
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:37,611
- I'm never gonna set
foot there, Brock,

1394
01:16:37,654 --> 01:16:39,178
you should stay away as well.

1395
01:16:42,224 --> 01:16:43,182
- Okay.

1396
01:16:43,225 --> 01:16:45,271
- Monica, can we
re-do the intro?

1397
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:46,968
I felt like some of
it was a bit stale

1398
01:16:47,012 --> 01:16:49,666
and I wanna change some of
the lines in the beginning.

1399
01:16:51,799 --> 01:16:54,323
- We just got a
call from Arnold Tasselman.

1400
01:16:54,367 --> 01:16:56,151
- Yeah, he just left,
what did he forget?

1401
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:58,719
- That's the weird
thing, he called to apologize

1402
01:16:58,763 --> 01:17:00,286
that he missed the
interview, he said he was in

1403
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:03,376
a minor accident on the
way here and he's sorry

1404
01:17:03,419 --> 01:17:05,160
that he missed it, he
couldn't call until now.

1405
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:06,509
- What do you mean
he missed the show?

1406
01:17:06,553 --> 01:17:08,729
I just interviewed him.
- I know,

1407
01:17:08,773 --> 01:17:11,079
it sounded just like him, he
said for the last two hours

1408
01:17:11,123 --> 01:17:12,428
he's been dealing
with the police

1409
01:17:12,472 --> 01:17:14,691
and the insurance and
this woman that he hit.

1410
01:17:15,867 --> 01:17:18,434
- The fucking same
Arnold Tasselman

1411
01:17:18,478 --> 01:17:21,568
who was just in the
studio 30 seconds ago?

1412
01:17:26,834 --> 01:17:28,618
- Mitchell.
- Shh, shh.

1413
01:17:29,619 --> 01:17:31,665
- Untie me.
- Shh, shh.

1414
01:17:32,753 --> 01:17:34,581
- Mitchell.
- Oh my god.

1415
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,410
- Leave 'em be.

1416
01:17:40,195 --> 01:17:42,415
- What are you doing here?

1417
01:17:44,504 --> 01:17:46,549
What the fuck are
you doing here?

1418
01:17:46,593 --> 01:17:48,900
- You're having trouble
putting this together?

1419
01:17:53,121 --> 01:17:54,122
- But this can't be.

1420
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:58,213
You're--
- I'm what, Mitchell?

1421
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:00,650
- You're dead, you're dead.

1422
01:18:00,694 --> 01:18:03,218
- For a long time, now.

1423
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:04,654
Pick up the camera.

1424
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:11,836
Pick up the goddamn camera.

1425
01:18:23,717 --> 01:18:24,718
Nice to meet you,

1426
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,460
I'm Andrew Tully

1427
01:18:27,503 --> 01:18:31,681
and you are a guest in my hotel.

1428
01:18:31,725 --> 01:18:34,554
A permanent guest
like my friends here?

1429
01:18:36,382 --> 01:18:37,774
We'll see.

1430
01:18:37,818 --> 01:18:42,649
Oh have you ever met the
Hell House brain trust?

1431
01:18:42,692 --> 01:18:44,825
This here is Mack,

1432
01:18:44,869 --> 01:18:46,827
his friendship to Alex

1433
01:18:46,871 --> 01:18:50,526
doomed him long before they
ever opened Hell House.

1434
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:52,659
We almost lost Tony if
it weren't for Mack here

1435
01:18:52,702 --> 01:18:56,619
spilling the beans at
just the right moment

1436
01:18:56,663 --> 01:19:01,668
and this is the most important
piece of my domino set.

1437
01:19:03,278 --> 01:19:04,801
Alex Taylor.

1438
01:19:06,499 --> 01:19:09,719
I was surprised how easily
you were manipulated by me.

1439
01:19:10,895 --> 01:19:14,115
Almost as easy as Alex,
right on television.

1440
01:19:15,987 --> 01:19:20,078
All I ever wanted
was for more guests.

1441
01:19:21,514 --> 01:19:23,385
♪ Be my guest

1442
01:19:23,429 --> 01:19:25,953
♪ Be my guest

1443
01:19:25,997 --> 01:19:27,389
And you all came.

1444
01:19:28,521 --> 01:19:31,698
Just like Alex.

1445
01:19:31,741 --> 01:19:33,134
Just like Diane.

1446
01:19:35,702 --> 01:19:37,747
Don't you dare drop that camera!

1447
01:19:45,712 --> 01:19:46,756
Now,

1448
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:48,889
I have to warn you,

1449
01:19:50,021 --> 01:19:52,719
this is gonna be very
difficult for you

1450
01:19:52,762 --> 01:19:57,376
and you are gonna have to
make some tough decisions

1451
01:19:57,419 --> 01:20:00,596
on how we keep the
dominoes falling

1452
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,512
and our hotel open.

1453
01:20:07,995 --> 01:20:09,257
Oh,

1454
01:20:10,824 --> 01:20:15,046
you were under the impression
that we closed the hotel.

1455
01:20:16,308 --> 01:20:20,529
The hotel has never
been fucking closed!

1456
01:20:20,573 --> 01:20:22,270
When we died here 30 years ago,

1457
01:20:22,314 --> 01:20:24,969
that was just our
grand relaunch!

1458
01:20:26,231 --> 01:20:29,974
Alex here, well he thought
he was opening up Hell House

1459
01:20:30,017 --> 01:20:33,064
in an abandoned hotel, well,

1460
01:20:33,107 --> 01:20:34,891
we never left.

1461
01:20:36,806 --> 01:20:40,071
The hotel has always
been occupied.

1462
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:44,640
Our lake of fire

1463
01:20:44,684 --> 01:20:47,078
that we have chosen to enter,

1464
01:20:47,121 --> 01:20:51,256
not been cast away to
like your Bible would say.

1465
01:20:52,474 --> 01:20:55,912
That's right, Mitchell,
I found the gateway.

1466
01:20:55,956 --> 01:20:58,828
And it's glorious.

1467
01:21:01,179 --> 01:21:02,528
Play us a song.

1468
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Diane?

1469
01:21:15,889 --> 01:21:17,891
No!

1470
01:21:22,896 --> 01:21:24,289
- No, no, no, no, no,

1471
01:21:24,332 --> 01:21:26,552
we're not done here,
Mitchell, you have more to do

1472
01:21:26,595 --> 01:21:30,817
before you can give up,
there are choices to make.

1473
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:33,515
Will someone help him
with that damn camera!

1474
01:21:49,401 --> 01:21:50,184
Mitchell.

1475
01:21:52,143 --> 01:21:52,969
Mitchell.

1476
01:21:54,623 --> 01:21:56,669
Tell me who leaves here today.

1477
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,371
In order to keep the
dominoes falling,

1478
01:22:03,415 --> 01:22:05,417
one of you will get to leave.

1479
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,984
Now, who is it gonna be?

1480
01:22:11,945 --> 01:22:14,208
We thought that you wouldn't
be too eager to choose

1481
01:22:14,252 --> 01:22:17,472
so I'll take someone out
of the running quickly.

1482
01:22:23,174 --> 01:22:26,133
We are legion, we are
servants of the snake

1483
01:22:26,177 --> 01:22:29,180
and we will release someone
into the lake of fire.

1484
01:22:31,704 --> 01:22:32,487
- No.
- No.

1485
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:34,141
- No.
- No, please no.

1486
01:22:34,185 --> 01:22:35,838
- No, no.
- No!

1487
01:22:40,147 --> 01:22:42,062
- Molly, no, Molly!

1488
01:22:42,106 --> 01:22:42,889
No, Molly!

1489
01:22:43,977 --> 01:22:45,413
Molly!

1490
01:22:45,457 --> 01:22:47,111
No, no!

1491
01:22:51,158 --> 01:22:51,941
Molly.

1492
01:22:53,769 --> 01:22:56,381
- Oh, they
chose lovely Molly.

1493
01:22:56,424 --> 01:22:58,992
Oh, we definitely want her.

1494
01:22:59,035 --> 01:23:02,038
The perpetually scared
make for the best guests.

1495
01:23:03,649 --> 01:23:04,867
- Please stop.

1496
01:23:06,521 --> 01:23:08,523
- It won't stop,

1497
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,046
it never stops,

1498
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:13,876
we go on and on into eternity.

1499
01:23:14,747 --> 01:23:15,835
Now Mitchell!

1500
01:23:17,532 --> 01:23:20,013
Pick who gets to walk
out of my front door,

1501
01:23:20,056 --> 01:23:23,016
it's not my choice, I
already made my choices.

1502
01:23:29,979 --> 01:23:32,808
I know what comes next.

1503
01:23:32,852 --> 01:23:37,509
And it begins with what
happens in this room right now.

1504
01:23:37,552 --> 01:23:39,685
Much later, way down the road,

1505
01:23:39,728 --> 01:23:42,427
someone will come to this hotel

1506
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:45,952
just like Alex did and
try to open it up again,

1507
01:23:45,995 --> 01:23:48,650
I know this already,
just like I knew

1508
01:23:48,694 --> 01:23:53,177
that Jessica would come
with one anonymous package.

1509
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:59,008
I have been sending this
unfortunate person videos

1510
01:23:59,052 --> 01:24:01,228
including this one here.

1511
01:24:02,882 --> 01:24:05,014
I see it now, Mitchell,

1512
01:24:05,058 --> 01:24:07,626
it's gonna be bigger
than Hell House,

1513
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:12,239
more souls for our lake of fire.

1514
01:24:12,283 --> 01:24:15,634
That series of dominoes begins

1515
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:18,724
now.

1516
01:24:58,111 --> 01:25:00,679
- No, please,
you don't have to do this,

1517
01:25:00,722 --> 01:25:02,550
please stop, no, no,
no, what are you doing?

1518
01:25:02,594 --> 01:25:03,725
No!

1519
01:25:03,769 --> 01:25:04,900
No!

1520
01:25:04,944 --> 01:25:06,685
No!

1521
01:25:32,101 --> 01:25:33,494
- Ma'am if you
don't tell us anything

1522
01:25:33,538 --> 01:25:34,887
we won't be able to find the
people who did this to you

1523
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:36,236
and the people you were with.

1524
01:25:39,587 --> 01:25:42,286
Can you give us any nearby
landmarks where this happened?

1525
01:25:43,156 --> 01:25:44,157
Was it near a park?

1526
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:46,638
A restaurant?

1527
01:25:48,248 --> 01:25:49,728
Do you remember a road name?

1528
01:26:04,656 --> 01:26:05,439
Yeah.

1529
01:26:06,614 --> 01:26:08,442
Okay, I'll be right there.

1530
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:17,233
We're going to need to call--
- The Abaddon.

1531
01:26:17,277 --> 01:26:18,147
- What?

1532
01:26:18,191 --> 01:26:19,801
- The Abaddon Hotel.

1533
01:26:23,892 --> 01:26:24,850
That's where I was.

1534
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:31,030
You should go there.

1535
01:27:15,204 --> 01:27:17,032
- What are you
doing, what is this?

1536
01:27:17,076 --> 01:27:19,644
- Protecting myself, I want
this recorded for insurance.

1537
01:27:19,687 --> 01:27:21,167
- You mean for blackmail?

1538
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:22,255
- Blackmail?

1539
01:27:22,298 --> 01:27:23,517
No, Alex, I want
it on the record

1540
01:27:23,561 --> 01:27:25,214
that I had nothing
to do with this.

1541
01:27:26,564 --> 01:27:28,479
- So you're looking out
for yourself, I get it.

1542
01:27:28,522 --> 01:27:30,219
Is it on?
- Yeah.

1543
01:27:30,263 --> 01:27:31,307
- Great.

1544
01:27:32,526 --> 01:27:34,789
Mack had nothing
to do with this.

1545
01:27:35,616 --> 01:27:37,183
- Just tell me what happened.

1546
01:27:37,226 --> 01:27:39,054
- Dude, it's fine, we
have a way out now, okay?

1547
01:27:39,098 --> 01:27:40,447
- A way out?
- Yeah.

1548
01:27:40,491 --> 01:27:42,318
- Alex, you lost everything.

1549
01:27:42,362 --> 01:27:43,711
How the hell do
we have a way out?

1550
01:27:43,755 --> 01:27:45,626
- Have you ever been
to Rockland County?

1551
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:47,236
Little town called Abaddon?

1552
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,630
Just north of the GW,
right along the Hudson?

1553
01:27:49,674 --> 01:27:51,937
- No, why would I
have ever been there?

1554
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:53,808
- Because there's a hotel
there called the Abaddon Hotel

1555
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:55,593
and it's completely vacant.

1556
01:27:56,768 --> 01:27:57,551
- And?

1557
01:27:59,335 --> 01:28:00,685
What do you want, start
a bed and breakfast?

1558
01:28:00,728 --> 01:28:02,208
- No, Mack, that's
where Hell House

1559
01:28:02,251 --> 01:28:03,905
is gonna get its second life.

1560
01:28:33,979 --> 01:28:36,024
Look the rest of them are
gonna be here any minute, okay?

1561
01:28:36,068 --> 01:28:37,939
I just need you to promise me
you won't tell them anything

1562
01:28:37,983 --> 01:28:39,506
about what happened.

1563
01:28:39,550 --> 01:28:42,117
Nobody can know why
we're leaving the city.

1564
01:28:42,161 --> 01:28:43,423
All right, we go
to Rockland County,

1565
01:28:43,467 --> 01:28:45,294
we do our haunt there
and if we're successful,

1566
01:28:45,338 --> 01:28:47,383
we'll be back in New
York next Halloween.

1567
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:50,430
- Have you even looked
at the contract?

1568
01:28:50,474 --> 01:28:52,084
- Yes I've looked
at the contract.

1569
01:28:53,346 --> 01:28:54,565
- I feel like you probably
got us into something

1570
01:28:54,608 --> 01:28:56,262
we're never gonna get out of.

1571
01:28:56,305 --> 01:28:57,785
- Would you just trust me, Mack?

1572
01:28:57,829 --> 01:29:00,353
This hotel's gonna
be perfect for us.

1573
01:29:00,396 --> 01:29:02,355
I just need you to
back me up, all right?

1574
01:29:03,225 --> 01:29:05,271
- They're here.
- Dude, just,

1575
01:29:05,314 --> 01:29:07,926
I'm serious, back me up, okay?

1576
01:29:08,709 --> 01:29:10,537
Just do this for me.

1577
01:29:10,581 --> 01:29:12,191
- Hey.
- What's up?
