1
00:00:19,815 --> 00:00:22,613
Tada! And here we are,
the stars of the hour

2
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:24,312
on Amy's new video camera.

3
00:00:24,352 --> 00:00:26,912
My expensive new video camera.
Daddy loves me.

4
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:28,616
Yeah, well, mine love me too, slut.

5
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:30,591
Bitch.

6
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:55,246
MEGAN IS MISSING

7
00:00:58,487 --> 00:01:01,615
I'd like to know who came up
with the stupid rule

8
00:01:01,656 --> 00:01:04,523
that you have to go back to school
the very next day after New Year's.

9
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,049
It's so fucking stupid.

10
00:01:06,094 --> 00:01:08,722
- When would you want to go back?
- Like Easter.

11
00:01:08,763 --> 00:01:10,594
At least then I wouldn't feel so wasted.

12
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:12,122
Let me use it too.

13
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:14,658
- You don't even use makeup.
- I do too.

14
00:01:14,703 --> 00:01:16,227
Like what? Like some baby powder?

15
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:18,262
Shut up.

16
00:01:18,306 --> 00:01:20,706
Virgins don't know how to wear makeup.

17
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:28,211
Oh, come on.
I didn't mean anything by it.

18
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,117
- You're so fucking sensitive.
- Whatever.

19
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:33,018
I don't see what the big deal is anyway.

20
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:35,147
Just fuck some guy and get it over with.

21
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,556
Good advice. Thanks.

22
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:41,492
You're a ho-- H-O, ho.

23
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,431
Jealousy talking. Blah blah blah.

24
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:46,900
That guy over there would do you.

25
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:57,000
- (computer chimes)
- Hey.

26
00:01:57,045 --> 00:01:58,410
Hey, Meg.

27
00:01:58,446 --> 00:02:00,505
Did you get some of that shit
Tercel had today?

28
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:03,279
- No. Was it good?
- Fuckin' awesome, girl.

29
00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:05,309
Fuck! He didn't even tell me
he had some.

30
00:02:05,353 --> 00:02:08,220
- Last time I blow him.
- You blew Tercel?

31
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,520
Like you haven't.
I've seen the stash you carry.

32
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:12,186
I didn't have to blow him for anything.

33
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:13,694
Yeah yeah, I'm sure.

34
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:16,322
- Can you save me some?
- Um, no.

35
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:19,128
- Me and Gideon are partying tonight.
- You party every night.

36
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,465
What's so special about one night?
Come on, save me some.

37
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:23,494
(boy laughs)
Ask her what she'll do for it.

38
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:25,938
Gideon wants to know
what you're willing to do for it.

39
00:02:25,974 --> 00:02:27,566
- Is he there?
- (Gideon laughing)

40
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:29,440
- Yeah.
- Fuck, Angie!

41
00:02:29,477 --> 00:02:31,707
Can't a person have
a private conversation?

42
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:34,715
Come on, Meggie, there's no secrets
between me and you.

43
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:38,310
- I know you inside and out.
- Go fuck yourself.

44
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:40,253
Why don't you come on over here
and play with me and Angie?

45
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:41,812
Yeah, in your dreams, you dork.

46
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:43,687
Aw, come on. You know you want to.

47
00:02:43,725 --> 00:02:46,250
Woman: God damn it, Megan!
Why didn't my program record?

48
00:02:46,294 --> 00:02:49,525
I unplugged the VCR to use the game box
and I forgot to plug it back in.

49
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:51,293
You forgot?! You forgot?!

50
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,995
I worked 12 hours a fucking day
to buy you that box

51
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:56,629
and all I ask is that you let me watch
my fucking program!

52
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:59,538
(both shouting)

53
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:01,098
- Lay off me.
- You selfish bitch.

54
00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:03,269
Why don't you go live with your father
and get the fuck out of my life?

55
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:06,007
I bought this game box.
It's out of here!

56
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:11,916
Wow, your mom is crazy.
What a twisted bitch.

57
00:03:11,953 --> 00:03:16,185
- She's crazier than my mom.
- (object clatters, breaks)

58
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:17,316
What are you doing?

59
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:18,917
Miss Stewart:
You're going to learn to respect me!

60
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,951
- Megan: That's mine!
- No. I paid for it

61
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:22,987
- and I get to smash it!
- Oh no.

62
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:26,290
Oh no.

63
00:03:29,404 --> 00:03:30,735
- (clears throat)
- (computer chimes)

64
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:32,205
- Oh, hold on.
- Mm-hmm.

65
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,765
Hey, Meg. What's happening?

66
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:37,573
Hey, Amy. Nothing. Just hanging.

67
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:39,603
I know it's a little late,
but I was wondering if you want

68
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,276
to hit the mall before they close
and see the new Choo shoes.

69
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:43,875
You want to go to the mall?

70
00:03:43,918 --> 00:03:47,183
Yeah, or we can just hang out.

71
00:03:47,222 --> 00:03:50,214
I can't. I have to do stuff with my mom.

72
00:03:50,258 --> 00:03:51,691
Are you all right?

73
00:03:51,726 --> 00:03:54,217
Yeah. Fuckin' cat fur makes me vomit.

74
00:03:54,262 --> 00:03:57,527
I told you, you have to keep him
out of your bedroom at night.

75
00:03:57,565 --> 00:03:59,260
Yeah, you told me.

76
00:03:59,301 --> 00:04:01,997
Okay well, if you need anything
call me, okay?

77
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:04,972
- I'll see you in school tomorrow.
- Yeah. Thanks, Amy.

78
00:04:05,006 --> 00:04:06,496
- Ciao.
- Bye.

79
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:12,477
So what's it going to be, Meggie?

80
00:04:12,514 --> 00:04:16,348
You know only Gideon's slaves
get the fairy dust.

81
00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:21,723
- I'll be right over.
- (Gideon laughs)

82
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,941
- (knocking at door)
- Come in.

83
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:49,011
- Morning, princess.
- Morning, Daddy.

84
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,315
You know, Party Restaurant's
getting all booked up.

85
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:54,345
Are you sure you don't want to have
your birthday party there?

86
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:55,583
Daddy, it's for kids.

87
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:57,523
I don't want people
who dress up like bears

88
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:58,890
singing "Happy Birthday" to me.

89
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:02,624
- Well, you used to like that.
- Yeah, when I was like 10.

90
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:05,599
Well, try not to grow up so fast, okay?

91
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:08,568
It makes your dad
feel really really old.

92
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:12,640
(kisses) You'll never be old, Daddy.

93
00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:16,440
Well, I'll figure something special
to get you for your birthday.

94
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:18,708
Like maybe a video camera?

95
00:05:18,747 --> 00:05:21,147
Hmm, mortgage payment, video camera.

96
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:24,583
- What should I do?
- It doesn't cost that much, jerk.

97
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:26,814
Louise, your daughter
just called me a jerk.

98
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:28,914
She's right, you know?

99
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:32,449
Women, always ganging up
on defenseless men.

100
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:35,554
(chuckles)
All right, get ready for school.

101
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:37,155
We'll talk about
your present later, princess.

102
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:38,927
Okay.

103
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:40,400
Hurry up, Amy. You're going to be late.

104
00:05:40,435 --> 00:05:42,426
Okay.

105
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:54,204
(sighs)

106
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:59,950
Princess. Princess Pudgy.

107
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:04,848
- (beeps)
- Ben?

108
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:06,861
- What's up, ma?
- Oh hey, Ben.

109
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:09,386
- Hey, Ben.
- Damn, all the hot girls in one place?

110
00:06:09,431 --> 00:06:11,899
- Yeah, where you're not.
- Bogus ass.

111
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,400
Why you gotta do me like that?

112
00:06:13,435 --> 00:06:15,733
Because she doesn't do losers, duh.

113
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,328
- Ah, I see.
- Yeah, she's not Kathy.

114
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:19,806
- Oh, shut up.
- All you girls are crazy as hell.

115
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:21,468
So what's going on with this weekend?

116
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:23,067
Party's on this weekend.

117
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:24,635
You can come by the crib
around midnight.

118
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:27,671
- Shit'll be off the hook.
- Cool. Can I bring Aaron?

119
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:29,910
- Nope. No dudes.
- Why not?

120
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:32,215
Because it's my party
and it's my rules, that's why.

121
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:33,311
Yeah, whatever.

122
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:35,015
Yeah, Kathy, you'd better
obey the rules.

123
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:36,045
Oh, shut up.

124
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,388
I have footage of you
"obeying the rules"

125
00:06:38,426 --> 00:06:40,326
on your hands and knees
at the last party.

126
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:42,420
Hey, Ben, can I bring Amy?

127
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:46,195
Man, this is a party, not church.

128
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:49,135
You're not really going
to drag her along, are you?

129
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,900
Whoa, y'all need to chill.
What's wrong with Amy?

130
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,374
Oh well, let's think. She's a drag.

131
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:56,536
She ain't fun for shit.
She don't know how to dress.

132
00:06:56,578 --> 00:06:57,875
Amy is hot.

133
00:06:57,912 --> 00:07:00,437
Man, if Amy was hot,

134
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:02,143
Lexie would have fucked her by now.

135
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:03,207
Shut up!

136
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:04,912
No, we all know you go with the flow.

137
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:07,717
Look, Ben, I'm serious.
Her birthday's coming up.

138
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:10,315
Oh. Well, she's going
to get an ass-whupping

139
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:12,258
if she comes to my party.

140
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:14,989
Well, either Amy comes or I don't.

141
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:16,758
(mutters)

142
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:18,789
- We gotta go, Meg.
- Okay, bye.

143
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,063
See you later.

144
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:23,332
What is it with you and this girl?

145
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:25,464
You fuckin' her?
She got blackmail on you? What?

146
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:26,701
She's my friend.

147
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:28,402
She's not a fucking loser
like the rest of you.

148
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:30,638
Yeah well, I got a reputation
to think about.

149
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:33,476
I run the best parties
and you are my premier party girl.

150
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:36,746
You bringing Amy along
could take away that crown.

151
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:38,843
Well, maybe I don't need to have it.

152
00:07:38,887 --> 00:07:40,479
Yeah, you do.

153
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:42,854
What the fuck else do you got?

154
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:46,618
Does Amy come or do I spend quality time

155
00:07:46,661 --> 00:07:49,528
with my mom Saturday night?

156
00:07:49,564 --> 00:07:51,725
- You owe me for this.
- Yeah, take a number.

157
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:52,755
I'm not kidding.

158
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,997
You're going to be jumping hoops
if you want to bring Miss Party Killer.

159
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,109
You just make sure
you take a fucking bath.

160
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:09,239
(rock music playing, chatter)

161
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,611
Oh, here they are. Come on, sweetheart.

162
00:08:14,656 --> 00:08:16,180
Give me $10. That's right.

163
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:18,749
You enjoy your time in there.
Honey, I like that outfit.

164
00:08:18,793 --> 00:08:19,817
- Oh shit!
- What's up, dawg?

165
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:22,193
My man Gideon.
Come on in, y'all, free of charge.

166
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,824
- Get in there, bitch.
- $10, honey. $10.

167
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:27,858
I like that outfit. Mm mm! $10.

168
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:30,962
Hey, um, I didn't get
my allowance this week.

169
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:32,632
Yeah well, no one rides for free.

170
00:08:32,674 --> 00:08:34,608
Get in there. You're sucking my dick.

171
00:08:34,642 --> 00:08:38,271
Oh shit, the hot squad
has arrived, plus one.

172
00:08:38,313 --> 00:08:39,473
- (laughing)
- Ben, shut up.

173
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:41,141
Aw, relax, Meg.

174
00:08:41,182 --> 00:08:42,547
I'm just playing. It's what players do.

175
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:44,950
$10, girls. Come on.

176
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:46,954
$10, girls. $10.

177
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:48,979
Oh, you sure you want
to enter the harem?

178
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:50,513
It ain't for lightweights, sweetheart.

179
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:52,321
- Yes.
- Ben: I don't know.

180
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,850
Jesus Christ! Let's go.

181
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:55,886
Eh, remember, Meg,

182
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,421
you want a deal, you gotta pay the man.

183
00:08:58,466 --> 00:08:59,455
All right.

184
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,365
Come on in. Let's go, let's go.

185
00:09:01,402 --> 00:09:04,200
Move it, chunky. $10, please.

186
00:09:04,238 --> 00:09:06,706
Mm mm! Go on in. $10, baby.

187
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:09,733
(loud rock music playing)

188
00:09:46,114 --> 00:09:49,106
(people cheering)

189
00:09:57,091 --> 00:10:00,083
(no audible dialogue)

190
00:10:16,244 --> 00:10:19,213
Boy: Hey, Lexie, can I see
your ass a little more, please?

191
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:20,839
Get the fuck out of my face!

192
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:23,715
- How about you show me your tits?
- Fuck you.

193
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:27,687
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Boy: Fuck you guys.

194
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:51,509
Get-- (sobs)

195
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:55,146
Leave me alone.

196
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:57,549
No, fuck you!

197
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:02,421
(boy laughing)

198
00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:04,891
Okay okay, Kathy, tell me,

199
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:06,826
what is your goal in life?

200
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:10,627
- To get fucked up.
- Okay.

201
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:13,463
So, uh, what are you right now?

202
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:15,492
- Pretty fucked up.
- (laughs) So...

203
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:17,333
- (coughing)
- ...you've pretty much

204
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:20,169
fucking achieved
your life goal like already.

205
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,005
- Mm mm!
- Oh!

206
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:23,067
Fuck yeah.

207
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:24,908
- Yeah, fuck-- fuck yeah.
- Holy shit.

208
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:28,177
- Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah.
- Holy...

209
00:11:30,718 --> 00:11:32,515
How are you feeling tonight?
What's up, everybody?

210
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:34,248
Oh shit, there's my man right here.

211
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:35,915
Come on, man.
Let's check this shit out, man.

212
00:11:35,957 --> 00:11:38,118
This party is off the hook.

213
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,717
Come here. What's up, baby girl?

214
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:42,025
What's going on?
How do you like the party so far?

215
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:44,497
Hmm? You like that?
I'll be up in the guest room.

216
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:46,762
- That's what I'm talking about.
- All night long, man.

217
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:48,393
Right there, man. No doubt, no doubt.

218
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:49,664
Come on, man. Come on, check this out.

219
00:11:49,704 --> 00:11:51,399
Check this shit out right here, man.

220
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:54,033
This is hot. This is hot.
What's going on, man?

221
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:55,406
This is hotness right here.

222
00:11:55,443 --> 00:11:56,774
Come on, come on, come on, baby.

223
00:11:56,811 --> 00:11:58,836
Oh, that's good, baby doll. That's good.

224
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,872
That's good shit right there.
That's good shit right there.

225
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,907
(giggling)

226
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:07,181
What's up, girls? How are you doing?

227
00:12:07,221 --> 00:12:08,210
You having a good time?

228
00:12:08,256 --> 00:12:10,190
These are my main party girls
right here, man.

229
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:12,454
What's up, girl? What's up, pimple?

230
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:14,256
Move over. I gotta--

231
00:12:14,295 --> 00:12:16,820
- Ah!
- Sorry, baby doll.

232
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:25,195
I'll be right back.

233
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:28,402
Ow.

234
00:12:37,785 --> 00:12:39,912
Boy: Oh shit, man!

235
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:42,218
(chuckling)

236
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:43,746
Jesus Christ.

237
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,021
Aw, are you okay? Does your head hurt?

238
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,254
Did you get a headache or something?

239
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:50,992
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Aw, poor baby.

240
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:53,125
Gideon, get over here.
Check this shit out, man.

241
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:55,761
- Check this shit out.
- This is clean.

242
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:57,327
Boy: Oh, man, you need to teach her--

243
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:58,497
- You okay, girl?
- I'm-- I'm okay.

244
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:00,370
Boy: You need to teach her
a couple of things, man.

245
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:02,433
Gideon: Seeing if you're okay.
You're a fine-ass bitch.

246
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:04,967
I'm just-- I'm fine.

247
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:06,980
- Stop.
- You want some?

248
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:09,949
- Stop!
- Fuck you, bitch!

249
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:12,248
Boy: Oh, man!

250
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:14,686
(crying)

251
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:17,885
- Fuckin' bitch!
- Boy: Yeah.

252
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:20,291
Oh, fuck, you just
got punched by a girl.

253
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:22,796
How does that feel, man?
How does that shit feel?

254
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,957
- (girls laughing)
- Boy: Oh, where are you going?

255
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:26,261
What is she wearing?

256
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,201
Aren't you going to be late
to your piano recital?

257
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:32,229
(chatter)

258
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:36,499
Boy: What you looking for?

259
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:38,671
Maybe I can help you, baby.

260
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:44,174
Ben: Get over here.

261
00:13:44,218 --> 00:13:46,209
Boy: Oh shit, dude! (laughing)

262
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:48,950
You want some of this, honor student?

263
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,016
Boy: Oh, baby.

264
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:54,152
You're all jacked up.

265
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:56,959
Oh, man. (chuckles)

266
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,729
(mumbles)

267
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,235
Boy: Okay okay.

268
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:08,805
Motherfucker. Close the door, man.

269
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:10,936
Close the door.

270
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:14,345
(boy laughing)

271
00:14:14,382 --> 00:14:16,373
(loud music continues)

272
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:35,959
Ahh!

273
00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:38,995
(no audible dialogue)

274
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:09,700
Boy: Hey, Lexie, why don't you do
something sexy or something?

275
00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:11,932
Like what?

276
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:13,804
Boy: Make out or something.

277
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:16,036
Oh yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

278
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:18,011
We don't make out for hired help.

279
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:20,775
Well, fuckin' do something. Jesus.

280
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:23,147
All right, watch this.

281
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:41,492
Boy: Oh, man. Aw shit.

282
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:46,736
(gasps)

283
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:49,242
- Holy shit!
- What the fuck?

284
00:15:49,276 --> 00:15:50,607
- Lexie: Oh my God!
- (laughter)

285
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:52,805
- Boy: Oh God.
- Lexie: Fuck you!

286
00:15:52,847 --> 00:15:56,150
- Boy: She's wasted.
- Boy #2 : She is wasted.

287
00:16:00,254 --> 00:16:01,744
(beeps)

288
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:05,919
- Hey, Meg.
- Hey. Are you okay?

289
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,191
- I'm so stupid.
- No, you're not.

290
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,926
It was my fault.
I shouldn't have brought you there.

291
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:15,367
- Now all your friends hate me.
- So what?

292
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:18,031
Fuck them. They're just shit.

293
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:20,768
- I'm such a loser.
- No, you're not.

294
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:22,776
I'm like nothing.

295
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,210
No, I want you to shut up about that.

296
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:29,676
I don't know why
you're friends with me.

297
00:16:29,717 --> 00:16:33,084
Well, because I am, that's why.
Look, I'm the big fucking loser.

298
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,918
I was the one blowing
some dickhead for a hit.

299
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:37,287
That did look kind of gross.

300
00:16:37,324 --> 00:16:40,259
- Yeah, it tasted gross.
- Ew.

301
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:42,592
I don't think I could ever do that.

302
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,962
- I'd be way too embarrassed.
- Why?

303
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,660
It's like a power thing.
You're in charge.

304
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,565
Oh, you really looked like
you were in charge.

305
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:49,694
No, I'm serious.

306
00:16:49,737 --> 00:16:53,673
Like, the guy can't come
unless you let him.

307
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:55,197
I don't know.

308
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:57,472
Well, you know, someday
you're going to do it.

309
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:59,479
I'll probably screw that up too.

310
00:16:59,513 --> 00:17:03,142
- Well, just practice before.
- Practice?

311
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:04,617
- Yeah.
- Like how?

312
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:06,552
Like on anything.
Like a banana.

313
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:08,384
Try not to leave teeth marks.
(clicks tongue)

314
00:17:08,422 --> 00:17:10,219
Was that how you learned?

315
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:12,248
- No.
- Tell me.

316
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:14,284
I was at summer camp
when I was 10.

317
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:16,057
You were 10 when you did it?

318
00:17:16,097 --> 00:17:19,157
Do you want to listen to this or not?

319
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,896
So I was at summer camp
and there was this counselor.

320
00:17:21,936 --> 00:17:24,700
He was older, like 17.

321
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:26,638
He was always telling me
that I was pretty and shit.

322
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:28,505
So one day he tells me
to come to the pantry

323
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,669
to like help him get paper plates.

324
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:31,700
And it's really small in there,

325
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:33,576
so we're like pressed up
against each other.

326
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:36,139
- Was he really hot?
- He was okay.

327
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:38,879
He looked kind of like that guy
in the movie "Se7en."

328
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:41,911
- Brad Pitt?
- No, the weird killer guy.

329
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:43,787
Oh. Ew.

330
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:46,452
Okay, anyways,
so he's pressed up against me

331
00:17:46,494 --> 00:17:49,952
and I can feel it and it's like huge.

332
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:51,897
And then he just looks at me
and pushes--

333
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:54,162
he puts his hand on top of my head
and pushes me down to my knees

334
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:56,226
- in front of him.
- Did you scream?

335
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,897
No, he was really gentle.

336
00:17:57,938 --> 00:18:00,600
And then he unzips his jeans
and just takes it out.

337
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:04,338
- And I was like, "Whoa."
- What was it like?

338
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:08,747
It was like this big fat snake
like staring me in the face.

339
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:10,306
- Oh my God.
- And he's like waving it around

340
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:12,478
and tapping it on my nose and shit.

341
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,987
And he puts it against my lips.

342
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:15,886
I'm like, I don't know what to do,

343
00:18:15,923 --> 00:18:18,619
but there's like
nowhere to go, you know?

344
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:20,627
And he just keeps pushing,
and I think at some point

345
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:22,390
I opened my mouth to say something like,

346
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:24,454
"Get that smelly thing out of my face,"

347
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:26,329
and he just shoved it in.

348
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:29,495
- Did you choke?
- Yeah, because it was huge.

349
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:32,005
My mouth was wide open like this. Like--

350
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,529
Oh wow.

351
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:35,474
And I was starting to turn blue
because I couldn't breathe.

352
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:37,568
And he tells me to breathe
through my nose and I do.

353
00:18:37,611 --> 00:18:40,171
And snot starts coming out of my nose.

354
00:18:40,214 --> 00:18:42,478
- Oh my God.
- But it wasn't funny.

355
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:44,609
I was like blowing my nose
all over his dick.

356
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:46,051
And he's like pumping it in and out,

357
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:48,850
back and forth in my mouth
and grabbing my hair.

358
00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:51,050
Did you-- oh my God.

359
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:55,289
- Did you scream?
- No.

360
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:57,729
He told me a couple of times actually
to get my teeth out of the way,

361
00:18:57,765 --> 00:19:00,427
but like where the fuck
were they supposed to go?

362
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:01,456
- You know?
- Yeah.

363
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:03,800
I mean like there wasn't any room
in there for his dick and my teeth.

364
00:19:03,837 --> 00:19:06,032
(laughs) Oh.

365
00:19:06,073 --> 00:19:08,598
So he just keeps pumping
and grabbing my hair.

366
00:19:08,642 --> 00:19:12,169
And at some point I look up
and I can see that he's going to come,

367
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:14,306
because, you know, guys look
really stupid before they come.

368
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:17,374
Mm-hmm. Like how?

369
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:20,148
Like, their faces get all scrunchy

370
00:19:20,187 --> 00:19:22,178
and they look like they're taking
a shit or something.

371
00:19:22,223 --> 00:19:24,487
Oh my God.

372
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:26,425
So he's doing all this weird shit
with his face.

373
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,552
Mm-hmm.

374
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:30,723
And all of a sudden there's like
this explosion in my mouth

375
00:19:30,764 --> 00:19:33,460
and all this hot gooey stuff
starts coming out.

376
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,661
- Did you swallow any of it?
- Yeah.

377
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:37,637
I swallowed a lot of it
because I didn't have a choice.

378
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:40,731
I mean there was like a gallon of it
and it just kept coming.

379
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:43,436
And he's like grabbing my head
so I couldn't move or anything, right?

380
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:46,378
And like I started coughing
and it just started coming

381
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:48,506
out of my nose
and the sides of my mouth,

382
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:49,743
like probably my ears.

383
00:19:49,783 --> 00:19:53,446
- Oh. Did it taste totally gross?
- It was like--

384
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:55,250
- Mom, what the fuck?
- Who are you talking to?

385
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:58,725
It's Amy. I was talking to Amy.
Jesus Christ.

386
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,989
It's me, Miss Stewart. Sorry.

387
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:04,464
It's late. Go to sleep, Megan.

388
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:06,489
Sorry, Meg.

389
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:11,995
Sorry.

390
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:17,643
I-- I hate it here.

391
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:20,146
I hate it so much.
I have to get out of here.

392
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,705
Where would you go?

393
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,411
I don't care.

394
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:29,616
Well, if you go anywhere,
I'm going with you.

395
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:33,593
- Really?
- Yeah. You're my best friend.

396
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:35,618
Really?

397
00:20:35,663 --> 00:20:38,029
I don't know what I'd do without you.

398
00:20:38,065 --> 00:20:40,329
Well, you're my best friend too, Amy.

399
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:43,234
- Really?
- You're my only real friend.

400
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,239
Miss Stewart: Megan, go to sleep now!

401
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:50,235
Maybe we'll run away together,

402
00:20:50,277 --> 00:20:52,802
go far away somewhere
like Texas or something.

403
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:54,370
Why Texas?

404
00:20:54,415 --> 00:20:57,111
I don't know. Sounds far away.

405
00:20:59,286 --> 00:21:01,948
Okay. Texas.

406
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:03,581
Texas.

407
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:06,491
- Good night, Amy.
- Good night, Meg.

408
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:13,462
Tada! And here we are,
the stars of the hour

409
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,161
on Amy's new video camera.

410
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:17,762
My expensive new video camera.
Daddy loves me.

411
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:19,739
Yeah, well, mine love me too, slut.

412
00:21:19,773 --> 00:21:21,570
Bitch.

413
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:24,839
- Okay okay, what should we do?
- I don't know.

414
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:26,402
We can make a documentary about my cat,

415
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:28,415
like "A Day in the Life of Charlie"
or something.

416
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:29,575
- Are you for real?
- Mm-hmm.

417
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:32,642
Okay, let's do something,
you know, like not boring.

418
00:21:32,686 --> 00:21:34,654
Ooh, I know.
Why don't you strip?

419
00:21:34,688 --> 00:21:36,053
I'm not doing that.

420
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,955
Oh yeah, that's right.
We said not boring.

421
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:39,618
Shut up. You strip then.

422
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,651
- Fine, I will.
- No no no no no.

423
00:21:41,695 --> 00:21:43,595
What if my parents see this by accident?

424
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,962
Well, your dad's pretty hot.

425
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:48,365
I so did not hear that.

426
00:21:48,402 --> 00:21:51,997
Okay, why don't we do an interview,
like your life's story?

427
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,529
- Okay.
- Okay, you go first.

428
00:21:53,574 --> 00:21:55,565
Okay.

429
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:00,644
Okay, start with your name and birthday.

430
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:02,911
Hello. My name is Megan Stewart

431
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,976
and I was born on August 12th, 1992.

432
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:08,510
I go to Alton High School
where I am an honor student.

433
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:09,681
(Amy laughing)

434
00:22:09,723 --> 00:22:13,454
I am a Leo which means
I'm generous and warm-hearted--

435
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:16,986
do you want to not laugh, bitch?

436
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,625
I am also faithful and loving

437
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:23,465
and creative and broad-minded.

438
00:22:23,504 --> 00:22:25,438
Well, then I say that last part's true.

439
00:22:25,472 --> 00:22:27,804
Okay, so what else?

440
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:33,108
Um, I live with my mom
who loves me very much.

441
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:36,139
I am her pride and joy.

442
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:42,382
My dad-- my real dad--

443
00:22:42,423 --> 00:22:46,086
is somewhere--
I don't know, I don't know--

444
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:48,117
doing something.

445
00:22:49,797 --> 00:22:52,766
My stepfather's name is Paul.

446
00:22:54,468 --> 00:22:56,459
He's in prison.

447
00:23:00,207 --> 00:23:03,335
He fucked me for the first time
when I was nine.

448
00:23:05,546 --> 00:23:08,413
And he kept on fucking me for two years.

449
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:15,511
My mom was so afraid of losing him
that she wouldn't--

450
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:18,047
she wouldn't even listen to me
when I told her about it.

451
00:23:21,061 --> 00:23:24,155
She even blamed me
when he got sent to prison.

452
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:33,071
Guys like me.

453
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:37,338
They've always liked me.
I'm... a likable girl, I guess.

454
00:23:39,012 --> 00:23:40,536
I'll pretty much do what you want,

455
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:44,142
but you have to tell me
that you love me.

456
00:23:49,223 --> 00:23:51,783
They're all so fucking pathetic.

457
00:24:17,317 --> 00:24:19,217
- (computer chimes)
- Hey.

458
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:22,154
- What the hell is that?
- It's my stuffed animal.

459
00:24:22,189 --> 00:24:24,316
- It's cute.
- Oh, it's adorable.

460
00:24:24,358 --> 00:24:25,916
Yeah, I know.

461
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:28,587
- So are you going to go tonight?
- I don't know.

462
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:30,358
There's never anything but losers there.

463
00:24:30,397 --> 00:24:34,060
Yeah well, I've met some
pretty cool guys there like Jorge.

464
00:24:34,101 --> 00:24:37,229
Okay, I hate to break it to you,
but Jorge's not cool.

465
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:40,172
Whatever. He's fun to hang out with.

466
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:43,370
- No.
- And so are you.

467
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,709
I mean, maybe sometime
you want to hang out again?

468
00:24:46,747 --> 00:24:50,979
Um, Lex, I'm just not like comfortable
with what happened before.

469
00:24:51,018 --> 00:24:52,849
- Yeah, no. It's okay.
- It's just not me, you know?

470
00:24:52,886 --> 00:24:54,877
No, I understand. That's fine.

471
00:24:54,922 --> 00:24:58,551
Um, actually I've been talking
to this new guy named Josh.

472
00:24:58,592 --> 00:25:01,026
- He's really cool.
- Oh yeah? What makes him cool?

473
00:25:01,061 --> 00:25:04,326
He skateboards
and he goes to Tolland

474
00:25:04,364 --> 00:25:07,162
- and he competes for real stuff.
- Oh really?

475
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,725
And he saw that I like skateboarding
and so he added me.

476
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,829
- You don't skateboard.
- Whatever.

477
00:25:11,872 --> 00:25:15,137
Guys dig it when chicks
are skateboarders.

478
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:18,269
Lex! Oh my God.

479
00:25:18,312 --> 00:25:20,644
Oh, you should check it out.
It's Skaterdude.

480
00:25:20,681 --> 00:25:22,672
- Okay.
- (keyboard clicking)

481
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,745
Doesn't he look like Brad Pitt?

482
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:32,691
A little in the eyes, I guess.
Does Josh have a cam?

483
00:25:32,726 --> 00:25:36,025
He does, but his little brother
like busted it or something crazy, so...

484
00:25:36,063 --> 00:25:37,553
I don't know.
But--

485
00:25:37,598 --> 00:25:40,158
ooh, one time he met
George Clooney in person.

486
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,758
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah.

487
00:25:41,802 --> 00:25:42,791
Oh my God.

488
00:25:42,836 --> 00:25:45,168
And he like talked to him
for like an hour at this mall and--

489
00:25:45,205 --> 00:25:46,900
- What mall?
- I don't know.

490
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,908
We should like go
and stalk him or something.

491
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:50,933
Yeah. That's funny.

492
00:25:50,978 --> 00:25:53,640
- But you should talk to him.
- Okay, maybe.

493
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,170
Maybe if I'm bored I'll go.
I don't know.

494
00:25:55,215 --> 00:25:57,240
Okay. Well then, I'll talk to you later.

495
00:25:57,284 --> 00:25:58,581
- Okay.
- Bye.

496
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:00,610
Bye.

497
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:12,662
Hello, my name's Amy Herman
and today's January 13th, 2007,

498
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:15,167
and this is my video diary.

499
00:26:15,202 --> 00:26:17,466
This is my room.

500
00:26:17,504 --> 00:26:20,064
As you can see,
it's very neat and clean,

501
00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:23,406
because I believe cleanliness
is next to godliness.

502
00:26:25,012 --> 00:26:28,243
This is Mr. Rupert.

503
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:30,374
He's in charge of all the rest
of the animals

504
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:32,612
and he makes sure that
they all behave when I'm gone.

505
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:35,178
I love him, but he's not
my favorite bear.

506
00:26:35,222 --> 00:26:38,658
My favorite bear is Billy Bear.
He's not here anymore.

507
00:26:43,397 --> 00:26:45,627
This is my best friend Megan.

508
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:48,032
We go on all kinds of crazy adventures.

509
00:26:48,068 --> 00:26:49,933
We're pretty wild together.

510
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,564
We're like sisters.

511
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:54,631
I just love her.

512
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:58,202
As you can see,
I live in a pretty nice house.

513
00:26:58,245 --> 00:27:00,304
We live in an area called Sherman Oaks.

514
00:27:00,347 --> 00:27:02,338
If you're not from Los Angeles,

515
00:27:02,382 --> 00:27:04,213
you have no idea what I'm talking about.

516
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:07,618
But there it is.

517
00:27:07,654 --> 00:27:11,920
- This is my mom Louise.
- Amy, what are you doing?

518
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:14,586
It's my video diary.

519
00:27:14,628 --> 00:27:17,392
You want to tape me rushing around,
trying to get dinner ready?

520
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:19,422
Sure. It's real life.

521
00:27:19,466 --> 00:27:21,798
So is doing your homework
while I'm doing this.

522
00:27:21,835 --> 00:27:24,565
Mom's a real estate agent
as well as being a mom.

523
00:27:24,604 --> 00:27:26,970
She's probably crabby because
she didn't sell a house today.

524
00:27:27,007 --> 00:27:29,373
- Amy.
- (laughs)

525
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:34,770
This is my cat Charlie. He's really old.

526
00:27:34,815 --> 00:27:39,252
He's actually older than me,
which makes him like 100 in cat years.

527
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:41,277
That's really old.

528
00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:43,585
This is my backyard.

529
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:48,116
This is our barbecue.

530
00:27:48,161 --> 00:27:49,788
When the weather's nice, we'll barbecue

531
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,527
and my parents will invite
some friends over for a party.

532
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:55,159
My dad's not here.

533
00:27:55,202 --> 00:27:57,932
He works long hours,
but he always makes sure

534
00:27:57,971 --> 00:28:01,134
to be here on my birthday
and other important holidays.

535
00:28:01,174 --> 00:28:04,701
Well, that's my house.

536
00:28:04,745 --> 00:28:06,940
Thanks for joining me on the tour.

537
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,778
Bye. (laughs)

538
00:28:11,084 --> 00:28:12,915
(computer chimes)

539
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:16,047
- Josh: Hello, hot chick.
- Hi, Skaterdude.

540
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:19,252
- (laughs) My name's Josh.
- I know.

541
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:20,884
How did you know that?

542
00:28:20,927 --> 00:28:23,293
My friend Lexie gave me your address.

543
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,525
Well, that was nice of her.

544
00:28:25,565 --> 00:28:28,261
- So what's your name?
- Megan.

545
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:30,326
Nice name.

546
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,669
I'm just checking your profile.

547
00:28:33,707 --> 00:28:35,800
So you go to Tolland?

548
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:39,141
Yeah, when I go to school at all.
The teachers suck there.

549
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:40,908
They do at Alton too.

550
00:28:40,947 --> 00:28:43,575
Oh, Alton. So we live near each other.

551
00:28:43,617 --> 00:28:45,710
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

552
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:47,743
You should come skateboarding sometime.

553
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:51,053
I don't board. I'll watch.
Where do you board?

554
00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:54,288
Usually down by the ravine
in the back of the diner.

555
00:28:54,327 --> 00:28:55,658
- You know where that is?
- Yeah.

556
00:28:55,695 --> 00:28:57,390
Yeah, I'm around there all the time.

557
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,897
Cool.

558
00:28:58,932 --> 00:29:01,765
Hey, can you tilt your webcam
down a little?

559
00:29:01,802 --> 00:29:03,326
Why?

560
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,203
I don't know. Just because.

561
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:08,605
Oh my God, all guys are the same.

562
00:29:08,642 --> 00:29:10,132
What?

563
00:29:10,177 --> 00:29:12,077
I'm not putting on a show
for you, freak.

564
00:29:12,112 --> 00:29:15,843
- No! I didn't mean it like that.
- Then what?

565
00:29:15,882 --> 00:29:17,941
I don't know. I'm-- nothing.

566
00:29:17,984 --> 00:29:21,215
I'm sorry. Don't worry about it.

567
00:29:27,127 --> 00:29:29,994
- How's that?
- Mm, much better.

568
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,624
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.

569
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:35,362
So your cam is broken, huh?

570
00:29:35,402 --> 00:29:38,166
Yeah, my fucking dog chomped on it.

571
00:29:38,205 --> 00:29:40,070
I thought your little brother broke it.

572
00:29:40,106 --> 00:29:43,473
Yeah, he did, and then my dog
took a swipe at it too.

573
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,740
Wow, sucks to be you.

574
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:48,407
(Josh laughs)
Damn, you're a firecracker.

575
00:29:48,448 --> 00:29:49,779
That's right.

576
00:29:49,816 --> 00:29:52,250
Gotta watch myself around you, huh?

577
00:29:52,285 --> 00:29:54,515
Uh-huh.

578
00:29:54,554 --> 00:29:57,045
Ah... I like that.

579
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,355
Too many girls just roll over--
like no challenge.

580
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:02,156
You know a lot of girls, huh?

581
00:30:02,195 --> 00:30:05,892
No. I'm into quality, not quantity.

582
00:30:05,932 --> 00:30:08,958
Yeah, I'm sure.
I've heard that one before.

583
00:30:09,002 --> 00:30:11,300
I'm serious. No bullshit.

584
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:13,863
Yeah well, maybe.

585
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:17,775
- Maybe what?
- Just maybe.

586
00:30:17,811 --> 00:30:19,301
(Josh sighs)

587
00:30:19,346 --> 00:30:22,747
So you going to the party tonight?

588
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:26,718
- I don't know.
- Hmm.

589
00:30:26,753 --> 00:30:28,618
At least you get to see
what I look like.

590
00:30:28,655 --> 00:30:30,646
I already know what you look like.

591
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,851
How?

592
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:34,554
I have an imagination.

593
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:36,459
(laughs) Oh no.

594
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:38,623
Lexie gave you my picture, didn't she?

595
00:30:38,665 --> 00:30:41,133
- Maybe.
- Oh my God, busted!

596
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:42,930
(laughs) You're such a stalker.

597
00:30:42,969 --> 00:30:45,938
I am not! I just-- never mind.

598
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:47,963
Ah. No, that's cool.

599
00:30:48,008 --> 00:30:50,602
I like knowing some chick
thinks I'm dope.

600
00:30:50,644 --> 00:30:52,202
I didn't say I thought you were dope.

601
00:30:52,245 --> 00:30:54,008
Maybe a dope.

602
00:30:54,047 --> 00:30:55,878
(laughs) Oh my God.

603
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:59,647
You've got a mouth on you,
a nice one too.

604
00:30:59,686 --> 00:31:02,814
- You think so?
- Mm, hell yeah.

605
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:05,782
Aw. (laughs)

606
00:31:05,825 --> 00:31:07,486
Now you're torturing Skaterdude.

607
00:31:07,527 --> 00:31:10,087
- (laughs)
- Aw, poor baby.

608
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,927
You're a cool chick.

609
00:31:11,965 --> 00:31:13,990
You should come tonight.
We should hook up.

610
00:31:14,034 --> 00:31:16,025
Maybe.

611
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:18,902
Come on, I'll be hanging
with my buds by the kitchen.

612
00:31:18,939 --> 00:31:22,238
- You gonna come?
- Maybe.

613
00:31:22,275 --> 00:31:26,268
Mm, okay, Maybe Megan.

614
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:29,339
- Well, I hope to see you tonight.
- Okay.

615
00:31:29,382 --> 00:31:32,647
- All right. Bye, hot chick.
- Bye.

616
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:50,036
- (beeps)
- Hey.

617
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,867
Where are you going?

618
00:31:51,905 --> 00:31:55,397
Um, I decided at the last minute
to go to Tracy's party.

619
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:57,842
Oh, I thought you weren't going to go.

620
00:31:57,877 --> 00:32:00,710
Yeah, it's just I was talking
to this kind of cool guy

621
00:32:00,747 --> 00:32:03,545
and he's going to be there,
so I thought I'd check him out.

622
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:06,746
Oh, okay.

623
00:32:06,786 --> 00:32:09,584
So, yeah. I'll call you tomorrow?

624
00:32:09,622 --> 00:32:11,590
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

625
00:32:11,624 --> 00:32:14,024
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

626
00:32:19,232 --> 00:32:21,666
Hey, video diary.

627
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:24,431
It's me, Amy, again.

628
00:32:24,471 --> 00:32:26,632
Yeah, like who else would it be?

629
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:34,674
I was going through
some magazines the other day

630
00:32:34,714 --> 00:32:38,707
because I want to find
a nice dress for my prom.

631
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:42,620
My prom's not for four years away,
but I figured if--

632
00:32:42,655 --> 00:32:45,590
if someone asked me to his,
then I should be prepared.

633
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:51,689
Hell, like who's going to ask me, right?

634
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,191
Fuck you.

635
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:04,236
- (beeps)
- Yeah?

636
00:33:04,277 --> 00:33:05,938
Hey.

637
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:08,504
Amy? What time is it?

638
00:33:08,548 --> 00:33:11,642
- 8:00.
- In the morning?

639
00:33:11,684 --> 00:33:14,050
- Jesus Christ, Amy.
- Sorry.

640
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:16,021
I was just wondering
how it went with that guy.

641
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:19,583
- Was he cool?
- He wasn't there, fucking dork.

642
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:22,652
- I looked for him for four hours.
- That's too bad.

643
00:33:22,695 --> 00:33:26,597
- What was his name?
- Josh, Josh the jerk.

644
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:28,624
Okay, well, what are you doing later?

645
00:33:28,668 --> 00:33:30,966
- Sleeping.
- After that?

646
00:33:31,004 --> 00:33:32,266
That's it.

647
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:34,569
Well, let's go to a movie or something.

648
00:33:34,607 --> 00:33:36,905
- Okay, call me later.
- Okay. Good night.

649
00:33:36,943 --> 00:33:38,604
Bye.

650
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:42,976
- (computer chimes)
- Josh: Hey, hot chick.

651
00:33:43,016 --> 00:33:45,280
How would you know?

652
00:33:45,318 --> 00:33:47,513
Uh-oh, you sound pissed.

653
00:33:47,554 --> 00:33:49,112
Oh no, why would I be pissed?

654
00:33:49,155 --> 00:33:51,089
Just because some jerk
tells me to meet him at a party

655
00:33:51,124 --> 00:33:52,216
and then never shows up?

656
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:53,555
Why would I be pissed?

657
00:33:53,593 --> 00:33:56,323
- I was there.
- No, you weren't.

658
00:33:56,362 --> 00:33:58,557
I was at that party
for four hours, buddy.

659
00:33:58,598 --> 00:34:00,759
If you were there,
then you're the invisible man.

660
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,700
I looked like an idiot.

661
00:34:02,735 --> 00:34:04,600
Well, I thought you looked great.

662
00:34:04,637 --> 00:34:08,129
- And how would you know?
- Because I was there.

663
00:34:08,174 --> 00:34:12,338
Okay. If you were there,
then what was I wearing?

664
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:15,677
Uh, well, you had on

665
00:34:15,715 --> 00:34:19,344
a really sexy little jean skirt

666
00:34:19,385 --> 00:34:22,252
and a black top with gold trim

667
00:34:22,288 --> 00:34:26,384
and, um, black high-heeled
kind of sandals.

668
00:34:26,426 --> 00:34:31,420
And I think you had
a butterfly clip in your hair.

669
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:35,366
- You were there.
- Yeah, I told you.

670
00:34:35,401 --> 00:34:38,029
Well, then why didn't you come up to me?

671
00:34:38,071 --> 00:34:39,561
I saw you looking around.

672
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:41,665
I figured you were probably
looking for me.

673
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:44,040
Yeah, I was.

674
00:34:44,077 --> 00:34:48,480
And you looked so great.
I mean you looked incredible.

675
00:34:48,515 --> 00:34:52,849
I totally felt my heart skip a beat
when I saw you.

676
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:54,786
I guess I just wimped out.

677
00:34:54,821 --> 00:34:57,415
So you watched me?

678
00:34:57,457 --> 00:34:59,857
(laughs) Yeah. Kind of creepy, huh?

679
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:03,021
No. It's kind of nice.

680
00:35:03,062 --> 00:35:06,122
Yeah, I saw you talking
with your friends.

681
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:08,361
You're really popular.

682
00:35:08,401 --> 00:35:12,030
I didn't want to barge in
and mess things up.

683
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:15,370
- You're shy.
- Mm, sometimes.

684
00:35:15,408 --> 00:35:18,377
It's okay.
I get shy too sometimes.

685
00:35:18,411 --> 00:35:21,539
Hmm. You seem like
you're always in control.

686
00:35:21,581 --> 00:35:23,845
No. Sometimes I just don't
know what to do,

687
00:35:23,883 --> 00:35:25,578
so I usually do something stupid.

688
00:35:25,618 --> 00:35:26,607
(Josh chuckles)

689
00:35:26,653 --> 00:35:28,951
(lisping)
Hey well, Stupid is my middle name.

690
00:35:28,988 --> 00:35:31,149
(laughs)

691
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:34,820
Anyway, I am sorry
I didn't talk to you last night.

692
00:35:34,861 --> 00:35:37,489
It's okay. I understand.

693
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,124
- You do?
- Yeah.

694
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:42,293
But I do wish I could have met you.

695
00:35:42,335 --> 00:35:44,997
Yeah. Well, there were just
so many people and stuff

696
00:35:45,038 --> 00:35:48,235
and it was like I didn't know
that many people

697
00:35:48,274 --> 00:35:51,243
- and I felt weird and--
- Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

698
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:55,839
So anyway, what are you doing today?

699
00:35:55,882 --> 00:35:57,372
Oh, nothing much.

700
00:35:57,417 --> 00:36:00,580
Me and my friend Amy are going to go
see the new Matt Damon movie.

701
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,282
Matt Damon. You like Matt Damon, huh?

702
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:05,188
Yeah. What's not to like?

703
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:07,887
I don't know.
He looks kind of gay to me.

704
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:10,259
- I don't think so.
- Hmm.

705
00:36:10,296 --> 00:36:13,459
- Well, I bet he can't skateboard.
- You're jealous.

706
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:15,763
(chuckles) Of him? Nah.

707
00:36:15,802 --> 00:36:17,497
Yes, you are! Admit it!

708
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:19,334
Why would I be jealous of Matt Damon?

709
00:36:19,372 --> 00:36:22,500
I don't know. You tell me.

710
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:26,103
Well, maybe because he gets
to spend time with you today

711
00:36:26,145 --> 00:36:29,376
and I don't.

712
00:36:29,415 --> 00:36:32,714
Well, you could if you ask me.

713
00:36:32,752 --> 00:36:35,277
Okay, then I'm asking you.

714
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:37,414
- Asking me what?
- (laughing)

715
00:36:37,457 --> 00:36:39,357
Wow, you don't make this easy, do you?

716
00:36:39,392 --> 00:36:43,089
- Hey, I'm worth fighting for.
- (chuckles) Yeah, you are.

717
00:36:43,129 --> 00:36:45,893
Thank you.

718
00:36:45,932 --> 00:36:50,460
So, Megan, after your date
with Matt Damon,

719
00:36:50,503 --> 00:36:52,130
would you like to meet up

720
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:54,469
and maybe get some ice cream
or something?

721
00:36:54,507 --> 00:36:56,441
Yes, I would.

722
00:36:56,476 --> 00:36:59,445
Cool. Well, that was easy.

723
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:01,743
The movie will be over around like 7:00.

724
00:37:01,781 --> 00:37:04,375
So do you want to meet us
at the theater?

725
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:07,750
Uh, you know, I'd love to meet
your friend and everything--

726
00:37:07,787 --> 00:37:08,913
Yeah yeah, it's okay.

727
00:37:08,955 --> 00:37:12,413
Um, why don't you web me later
around like 7:30?

728
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:14,221
Okay, that sounds good.

729
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,491
- Okay. Bye, Josh.
- Bye.

730
00:37:22,602 --> 00:37:23,933
- (beeps)
- Hey.

731
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,268
Hey. Guess who I was just talking to.

732
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:28,740
- Lexie?
- No. Josh.

733
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:31,573
Josh, as in Josh the big fat jerk
who stood you up Josh?

734
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:33,272
No no, he's not a jerk. He was just shy.

735
00:37:33,313 --> 00:37:35,781
- For four hours?
- Okay, so he's very shy.

736
00:37:35,815 --> 00:37:38,375
But listen, I was just talking to him
and he's really sensitive.

737
00:37:38,418 --> 00:37:39,680
What did he say?

738
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,516
Well, we were talking about
lots of stuff and, get this,

739
00:37:41,554 --> 00:37:43,351
he remembered everything
I was wearing last night.

740
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:44,651
Wow. So what are you going to do?

741
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:46,124
I'm going to see him tonight
after the movie.

742
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,183
He's going to web me later.

743
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:48,853
Hey, you want to come over
and say hello?

744
00:37:48,895 --> 00:37:51,455
Um, if you don't think
that's going to be weird.

745
00:37:51,497 --> 00:37:53,226
Um, no. He's really cool about stuff.

746
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:55,291
Yeah. Oh, there you are.

747
00:37:55,335 --> 00:37:57,200
Hey.

748
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:01,699
Okay, there he is. Okay, be cool.

749
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:03,868
- (computer chimes)
- Hello?

750
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,878
Josh: Hey, Megan. How was the movie?

751
00:38:05,912 --> 00:38:08,403
- Oh, it was okay.
- Hey, who's that?

752
00:38:08,448 --> 00:38:11,315
- Hey, I'm Megan's best friend Amy.
- Hi, Amy.

753
00:38:11,351 --> 00:38:13,251
I think I might have seen you
around school before.

754
00:38:13,286 --> 00:38:16,722
- I thought you go to Tolland.
- Yeah, I do, when I go to school.

755
00:38:16,756 --> 00:38:19,281
But sometimes I just like
to hang out at Alton

756
00:38:19,325 --> 00:38:21,156
because the girls are prettier.

757
00:38:21,194 --> 00:38:23,992
- And don't you forget it.
- (Josh chuckles)

758
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,793
So what do you look like?

759
00:38:25,832 --> 00:38:27,993
Oh, Megan didn't show you my pic?

760
00:38:28,034 --> 00:38:30,696
- I don't remember if she did.
- Yes, you do, bitch!

761
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:33,729
- Don't listen to her, Josh.
- That's okay.

762
00:38:33,773 --> 00:38:35,934
I-- I have another one here
I was going to send you anyway

763
00:38:35,975 --> 00:38:37,943
since my web's broken.

764
00:38:37,977 --> 00:38:39,911
Here it comes. Hold on.

765
00:38:41,748 --> 00:38:45,013
- Oh, you didn't tell me you surf.
- Yeah, totally.

766
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:46,712
The waves are awesome this time of year

767
00:38:46,753 --> 00:38:49,153
because of the currents
coming up from Mexico.

768
00:38:49,188 --> 00:38:52,624
- Does it get cold?
- Nah, I wear a wetsuit.

769
00:38:52,658 --> 00:38:55,149
And also the adrenaline
keeps you warm.

770
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:58,425
- That sounds really cool.
- Yeah.

771
00:38:58,464 --> 00:39:01,228
So are you two doing something tonight?

772
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:03,360
Oh, no. Actually Amy was just leaving.

773
00:39:03,403 --> 00:39:04,995
Bye, Amy. See you in school tomorrow.

774
00:39:05,037 --> 00:39:06,698
Bye.

775
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:07,933
(mouths word)

776
00:39:07,974 --> 00:39:11,808
I saw that, Amy. (laughs)

777
00:39:11,844 --> 00:39:14,904
So, alone at last.

778
00:39:14,947 --> 00:39:18,041
So you still want to meet up
and do something?

779
00:39:18,084 --> 00:39:20,552
- Sure. Where?
- I don't know.

780
00:39:20,586 --> 00:39:23,714
Why don't we meet behind the diner
in like 20 minutes?

781
00:39:23,756 --> 00:39:26,953
- Behind the diner-- how romantic.
- (laughs)

782
00:39:26,993 --> 00:39:28,483
Well, if you want to meet
somewhere else--

783
00:39:28,528 --> 00:39:30,257
No, I'm kidding. I'm sorry.

784
00:39:30,296 --> 00:39:32,264
I can be kind of a smart-ass sometimes.

785
00:39:32,298 --> 00:39:33,993
Ah, no problemo.

786
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:36,024
I know how to deal with smart-asses.

787
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:39,560
- Oh? And how is that?
- You'll see.

788
00:39:39,605 --> 00:39:41,505
See? It's always the quiet ones
you have to worry about.

789
00:39:41,541 --> 00:39:43,702
(Josh chuckles)

790
00:39:43,743 --> 00:39:46,143
- I would never hurt you, Megan.
- I know.

791
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:48,272
- Do you?
- Yes.

792
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:50,976
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

793
00:39:51,017 --> 00:39:53,247
I trust you too.

794
00:39:53,286 --> 00:39:55,880
So see you in like 20 minutes.

795
00:39:55,922 --> 00:39:58,584
- Okay. Bye, Josh.
- Cool. Bye.

796
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:42,158
- (beeps)
- Hello?

797
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:44,328
- Hey, Kathy, it's Amy.
- I know.

798
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,634
What I don't know
is why you're calling me.

799
00:40:46,672 --> 00:40:48,572
I was just wondering
if you talked to Megan today.

800
00:40:48,608 --> 00:40:49,597
No, I haven't.

801
00:40:49,642 --> 00:40:51,542
Um, I'm kind of busy,
so I'm going to go, okay?

802
00:40:51,577 --> 00:40:53,807
- Bye.
- (beeps)

803
00:40:53,846 --> 00:40:57,646
(keypad beeping)

804
00:40:57,683 --> 00:40:59,048
- (beeps)
- Hello?

805
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:00,848
- Hey, Lexie.
- Hi.

806
00:41:00,887 --> 00:41:02,878
Are you sure you didn't dial
the wrong number?

807
00:41:02,922 --> 00:41:05,015
I know you don't like me,
but I was just wondering

808
00:41:05,057 --> 00:41:06,388
if you saw Megan in history class today.

809
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:08,723
Huh-uh. Well, I-- I gotta go.

810
00:41:08,761 --> 00:41:10,490
- But--
- Bye.

811
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:16,524
(kids laughing)

812
00:41:18,271 --> 00:41:21,468
- (computer chimes)
- Hey, Josh.

813
00:41:21,507 --> 00:41:24,237
- Hey. Who's this?
- It's Amy.

814
00:41:24,277 --> 00:41:26,802
I met you yesterday.
I'm Megan's best friend.

815
00:41:26,846 --> 00:41:28,939
Oh, yeah yeah yeah. How's it going?

816
00:41:28,981 --> 00:41:31,711
Not so good.
Have you heard from Megan at all?

817
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:33,912
No, I was going to ask you
the same thing.

818
00:41:33,953 --> 00:41:36,285
We were supposed
to get together last night

819
00:41:36,322 --> 00:41:38,483
and she never showed up.

820
00:41:38,524 --> 00:41:42,585
She hasn't been at school all day.
She hasn't called me at all.

821
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:45,597
Mm, well, I haven't seen her.

822
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:48,395
I mean do you guys talk all the time?

823
00:41:48,434 --> 00:41:50,493
Yeah, like every hour.

824
00:41:50,536 --> 00:41:52,766
This is so weird.

825
00:41:52,805 --> 00:41:55,399
You know, maybe she went
somewhere with her mom.

826
00:41:55,441 --> 00:41:58,001
No, Megan and her mom don't get along.

827
00:41:58,044 --> 00:41:59,238
I don't know, Amy.

828
00:41:59,278 --> 00:42:02,406
I mean we talked and I thought
we got along great.

829
00:42:02,448 --> 00:42:05,611
- And then she never showed up.
- Okay.

830
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:07,949
Well, if you hear from her,
will you web me?

831
00:42:07,987 --> 00:42:09,978
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, Josh.

832
00:42:10,022 --> 00:42:12,013
- Bye.
- Bye.

833
00:42:16,228 --> 00:42:18,355
- (newscast music playing)
- News anchor: In America

834
00:42:18,397 --> 00:42:21,059
a child disappears every 40 seconds.

835
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,194
The police need your help
to solve these crimes.

836
00:42:24,236 --> 00:42:28,969
Over 2,000 times a day
somewhere a mother cries out:

837
00:42:33,112 --> 00:42:36,775
Tonight on "Missing":
a beautiful teenage girl,

838
00:42:36,816 --> 00:42:38,579
a desperate mother...

839
00:42:38,618 --> 00:42:40,779
She's a good girl. Just don't hurt her.

840
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,879
News anchor:
...and a mysterious disappearance.

841
00:42:42,922 --> 00:42:45,618
I don't know. One day she just
didn't show up for school.

842
00:42:45,658 --> 00:42:48,991
Is she a runaway
or is she the victim of foul play?

843
00:42:49,028 --> 00:42:52,293
No matter which way you look
at the facts, one fact remains:

844
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:56,931
Good evening. I'm Callie Daniels.

845
00:42:56,969 --> 00:43:00,461
Megan Stewart, a beautiful
popular 14-year-old girl

846
00:43:00,506 --> 00:43:03,998
vanished without a trace after going out
with friends two days ago.

847
00:43:04,043 --> 00:43:06,409
Police have no leads
in the baffling disappearance

848
00:43:06,445 --> 00:43:09,744
of one of Alton High School's
most popular students.

849
00:43:09,782 --> 00:43:12,410
Megan Stewart is by all accounts

850
00:43:12,451 --> 00:43:15,113
one of the shining stars
of Alton High School--

851
00:43:15,154 --> 00:43:17,816
a straight-A student
who devotes her spare time

852
00:43:17,857 --> 00:43:19,757
to helping her community
and her friends.

853
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,659
She's popular with students
and faculty alike.

854
00:43:22,695 --> 00:43:25,892
Megan Stewart is a role model
for many of our students here.

855
00:43:25,931 --> 00:43:29,389
She's active in her community
and a very good student.

856
00:43:29,435 --> 00:43:32,268
Megan's mother, Joyce Stewart,
gave this statement.

857
00:43:32,304 --> 00:43:35,535
I-- I just want her to be
brought back safe

858
00:43:35,574 --> 00:43:37,633
to the people who love her and miss her.

859
00:43:37,677 --> 00:43:40,771
We asked her friends
if they thought Megan ran away.

860
00:43:40,813 --> 00:43:43,304
- Megan would never run away.
- No. She's like my best friend.

861
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:45,442
And if something was wrong
in her life, she would tell us.

862
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:46,644
She would totally.

863
00:43:46,686 --> 00:43:50,087
Whether a runaway, abduction
or other form of foul play,

864
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:53,057
the one fact remains
that this beautiful young girl

865
00:43:53,092 --> 00:43:54,855
disappeared without a trace.

866
00:43:54,894 --> 00:43:57,362
Police are asking for your help.

867
00:43:57,396 --> 00:44:00,263
Megan Stewart is 5'1",

868
00:44:00,299 --> 00:44:03,735
105 lbs with dark hair and hazel eyes.

869
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:07,432
She was last seen wearing blue jeans
and a maroon blouse.

870
00:44:07,473 --> 00:44:10,374
If you know anything regarding
the whereabouts of this young girl,

871
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:12,741
please contact North Hollywood Police

872
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:17,215
or you can send anonymous tips
to findmegan.com.

873
00:44:17,249 --> 00:44:19,843
Police are also looking for clues
in the disappearance

874
00:44:19,885 --> 00:44:23,218
of 13-year-old Tercel Jackson
who was abducted

875
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:26,156
from his home in Crenshaw
yesterday afternoon.

876
00:44:26,192 --> 00:44:28,490
Anyone with information
is encouraged to call

877
00:44:28,527 --> 00:44:30,791
the Crenshaw Police Department.

878
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:33,230
We will be right back with more
on the disappearance

879
00:44:33,265 --> 00:44:36,632
and search for Megan Stewart
after these messages.

880
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,900
It's been four days
since I've heard from Megan.

881
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:50,847
I don't think she ran away.

882
00:44:50,883 --> 00:44:54,250
That's what all the news people
are saying.

883
00:44:54,286 --> 00:44:57,881
I don't know what happened,
but I'm worried.

884
00:45:00,593 --> 00:45:02,584
This is so weird.

885
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,563
I keep expecting her
to call me any second.

886
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,160
I sleep with my cell phone
next to my pillow.

887
00:45:16,475 --> 00:45:19,239
I know she's alive.

888
00:45:19,278 --> 00:45:21,508
I can feel it.

889
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:33,484
A stunning break in the case
of missing teenager Megan Stewart.

890
00:45:33,526 --> 00:45:35,824
Police today released
security camera footage

891
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:39,194
from the back of a diner
just one mile from where she lived.

892
00:45:39,231 --> 00:45:42,428
The footage clearly shows
that she encounters a man

893
00:45:42,468 --> 00:45:44,561
who appears to lead her away.

894
00:45:44,603 --> 00:45:47,595
Sergeant Jon Simonelli
of District 33 Police Department

895
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,403
had this statement.

896
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:51,068
Well, we got a lucky break in the case.

897
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:53,203
We obtained some surveillance footage.

898
00:45:53,245 --> 00:45:56,078
And on the videotape it appears
as if she's waiting for someone.

899
00:45:56,115 --> 00:45:59,778
Whether the man she walked away with
was the individual she was waiting for

900
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:03,118
- is still under investigation.
- So you think she may be a runaway.

901
00:46:03,155 --> 00:46:05,623
Well, we're looking at
all possibilities at the moment.

902
00:46:05,658 --> 00:46:08,422
Anyone with information
is encouraged to contact

903
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,553
the North Hollywood Police Department.

904
00:46:10,596 --> 00:46:13,622
And when we return,
a pure-bred cocker spaniel

905
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:16,533
accidentally drives his owner's car
through a store window.

906
00:47:18,697 --> 00:47:20,790
(computer chimes)

907
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:23,996
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey, cute girl.

908
00:47:24,036 --> 00:47:26,129
Don't say that.

909
00:47:26,171 --> 00:47:28,867
I wouldn't say it if it weren't true.

910
00:47:28,908 --> 00:47:30,899
You don't think you're cute?

911
00:47:30,943 --> 00:47:34,344
- I do.
- I'm all right.

912
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,644
Mm, I think you're sexy.

913
00:47:36,682 --> 00:47:40,243
I think you're one sexy girl.

914
00:47:40,286 --> 00:47:42,777
Was that you in the video?

915
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:44,880
What, that security video?

916
00:47:44,924 --> 00:47:46,949
That was some old dude.

917
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:49,984
- So you didn't see her there?
- No.

918
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:53,590
I think maybe she skipped out
with that guy before I got there.

919
00:47:53,632 --> 00:47:55,497
You know, she seems kind of flaky.

920
00:47:55,534 --> 00:47:59,300
She wouldn't do that.
She would have told me.

921
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:01,499
So you two are really close, huh?

922
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,168
Yeah, we are.

923
00:48:04,209 --> 00:48:07,440
It's funny, you don't seem
like the kind of girl

924
00:48:07,479 --> 00:48:09,470
she would hang with.

925
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:12,951
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

926
00:48:12,985 --> 00:48:16,443
Just look at yourself.
You know exactly what I mean.

927
00:48:16,488 --> 00:48:18,979
No, I don't.
You just said I was sexy.

928
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:21,015
Then you're stupid too.

929
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,085
You'll believe anything, won't you?

930
00:48:24,863 --> 00:48:28,196
I think you know where she is.

931
00:48:28,233 --> 00:48:33,068
Trying to change the conversation
won't change the facts, Amy.

932
00:48:33,105 --> 00:48:35,335
What facts?

933
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:38,901
That you're fat,
that you have no friends,

934
00:48:38,944 --> 00:48:42,004
that no one finds you attractive.

935
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:44,447
- I have friends.
- (laughs)

936
00:48:44,483 --> 00:48:48,317
You have one friend who left
and didn't tell you where she was going

937
00:48:48,354 --> 00:48:50,015
because she didn't
want you tagging along.

938
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:52,580
No, that's not true.

939
00:48:52,624 --> 00:48:55,457
Would you like to have friends, Amy?

940
00:48:55,494 --> 00:48:58,486
Would you like to sleep with something
besides your teddy bear?

941
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,829
- Shut up.
- Mm-hmm.

942
00:49:01,867 --> 00:49:05,394
Do you hug your teddy bear, Amy,
and pretend he's some guy you like

943
00:49:05,437 --> 00:49:08,565
- who's never going to talk to you?
- Shut up.

944
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,599
Because you're some loser
who won't spread her legs?

945
00:49:11,643 --> 00:49:13,668
You don't know anything about me.

946
00:49:13,712 --> 00:49:15,805
You don't know who I am.

947
00:49:15,848 --> 00:49:18,817
I know exactly who you are, Amy.

948
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:22,685
Megan told me all about you--
how pathetic you are,

949
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:25,155
how you follow her around
like a little puppy.

950
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:28,216
You're like a big joke to her.

951
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,696
- What did you do to Megan?
- Nothing.

952
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:34,790
Nothing she didn't do
with 100 guys before.

953
00:49:43,876 --> 00:49:47,937
Today on "Missing," new revelations
in the case of Megan Stewart,

954
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,211
the North Hollywood teenager
who disappeared over two weeks ago.

955
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,617
Police were given a statement
by 14-year-old Amy Herman,

956
00:49:54,653 --> 00:49:56,621
a close friend of the missing girl.

957
00:49:56,655 --> 00:49:58,145
Reporter: What did you tell the police?

958
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:00,818
I just told them about someone
Megan was chatting with online.

959
00:50:00,859 --> 00:50:02,884
- What's this person's name?
- Had she met with this man before?

960
00:50:02,928 --> 00:50:05,453
I'm sorry, but that information is vital
to the ongoing investigation.

961
00:50:05,497 --> 00:50:07,692
Well, now that you've come forward,
do you fear for your own life?

962
00:50:07,733 --> 00:50:10,327
All right, that's it.
No more questions for now.

963
00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:15,033
We have confirmed that Amy Herman
mentioned a man named Josh

964
00:50:15,074 --> 00:50:17,565
who apparently met Megan Stewart
in a chat room

965
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:19,907
using the nickname Skaterdude.

966
00:50:19,945 --> 00:50:22,880
A complete chronology
of the investigation can be found

967
00:50:22,915 --> 00:50:26,316
at our website: findmegan.com.

968
00:50:26,351 --> 00:50:28,876
We'll be back after these messages.

969
00:50:32,191 --> 00:50:34,591
Let me take you on a tour
of some of the places

970
00:50:34,626 --> 00:50:36,321
Megan and I would go to.

971
00:50:36,361 --> 00:50:38,659
I keep thinking I'll see her somewhere.

972
00:50:38,697 --> 00:50:42,064
I keep hoping I do, at least.
This is a diner.

973
00:50:42,101 --> 00:50:43,966
We always used to come here
after school.

974
00:50:44,002 --> 00:50:46,903
- What are you doing?
- Get that camera out of my face.

975
00:50:46,939 --> 00:50:49,806
I'm not recording you guys.
I'm making a video diary for myself.

976
00:50:49,842 --> 00:50:52,003
About how you messed up
Megan's life, huh?

977
00:50:52,044 --> 00:50:53,033
No--

978
00:50:53,078 --> 00:50:55,808
You know it's because of you
that she's not here, right?

979
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:57,338
That's not true.

980
00:50:57,382 --> 00:50:58,940
What are you going to do, sell this?

981
00:50:58,984 --> 00:51:00,349
Are you going to sell this to the news?

982
00:51:00,385 --> 00:51:03,548
No, I'm-- I'm not going
to sell this to anyone.

983
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:06,854
You know what?
Stay the fuck out of my face, bitch.

984
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:11,593
- As you can see I'm very well liked.
- Hey!

985
00:51:13,398 --> 00:51:15,195
You know that
this is all your fault, right?

986
00:51:15,234 --> 00:51:17,293
You think you're hot shit
because she spent

987
00:51:17,336 --> 00:51:19,099
every waking moment with you?

988
00:51:19,138 --> 00:51:20,628
- No, I--
- Is that what you think?

989
00:51:20,672 --> 00:51:22,367
I don't think that.

990
00:51:22,407 --> 00:51:25,865
Fuck. She loved me!

991
00:51:25,911 --> 00:51:29,403
And I-- I loved her back.
I loved her so much!

992
00:51:29,448 --> 00:51:32,076
And now she's gone because of you!

993
00:51:33,185 --> 00:51:35,346
This is all your fault

994
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:38,288
and I can't fix it.

995
00:51:38,323 --> 00:51:41,121
There's nothing I can fucking do.

996
00:51:43,195 --> 00:51:46,096
Get the fuck out of my face.

997
00:51:46,131 --> 00:51:49,328
(crying) This is all your fault.

998
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:54,200
Amy: Megan and I used to come
under this bridge

999
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,707
and just talk about stuff.

1000
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:58,835
I remember one time
when it just started to rain

1001
00:51:58,877 --> 00:52:00,504
and then it started to pour.

1002
00:52:00,546 --> 00:52:03,913
All of a sudden the entire river
was flooded.

1003
00:52:03,949 --> 00:52:05,940
We didn't want to tell anyone about it.

1004
00:52:05,984 --> 00:52:08,612
We thought people might think
we were stupid.

1005
00:52:08,654 --> 00:52:10,645
I guess we kind of were.

1006
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:20,025
Megan's so adventurous.

1007
00:52:20,065 --> 00:52:23,228
She's not afraid to try things
and she doesn't care

1008
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:25,293
what other people think about her.

1009
00:52:27,172 --> 00:52:29,572
I wish I was more like her.

1010
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:31,701
I'm going to show you something.

1011
00:52:40,652 --> 00:52:42,244
This is Billy Bear.

1012
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:44,983
I've had him since I was like five.

1013
00:52:45,023 --> 00:52:47,014
Three years ago my mom
wanted me to get rid of him

1014
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:50,825
because he was all ragged,
but I just couldn't.

1015
00:52:50,862 --> 00:52:54,298
So I keep him here and I can
visit him whenever I want.

1016
00:52:56,868 --> 00:52:59,530
People keep saying how this experience

1017
00:52:59,571 --> 00:53:01,766
is supposed to help me grow up,

1018
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:07,143
but... I don't understand that.

1019
00:53:07,179 --> 00:53:10,114
If anything, it's making me
not want to grow up.

1020
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,941
There's so much weirdness out there.

1021
00:53:16,188 --> 00:53:19,589
I'd just-- I'd just rather
stay here with Billy.

1022
00:53:32,437 --> 00:53:35,838
(keyboard clicking)

1023
00:53:35,874 --> 00:53:39,071
(computer chimes)

1024
00:53:39,111 --> 00:53:40,772
Who is this?

1025
00:53:40,812 --> 00:53:45,613
- Josh: I think you know.
- Josh?

1026
00:53:45,651 --> 00:53:49,587
You have a big mouth.

1027
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:51,782
I didn't say you kidnapped Megan.

1028
00:53:51,823 --> 00:53:55,850
No. You just said you think I did.

1029
00:53:55,894 --> 00:54:00,331
Well, if you didn't,
you have nothing to worry about.

1030
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:02,925
I don't have anything to worry about.

1031
00:54:02,968 --> 00:54:04,458
They can't find me.

1032
00:54:04,503 --> 00:54:08,462
You can set up
free screen names anywhere.

1033
00:54:08,507 --> 00:54:10,975
What do you want from me?

1034
00:54:11,009 --> 00:54:15,810
I want you to shut
your big fucking mouth.

1035
00:54:15,847 --> 00:54:18,372
And if you still feel like
yakking to the police,

1036
00:54:18,417 --> 00:54:22,877
I may have to pay you a visit
or your mom.

1037
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:26,220
I'm watching you, Amy.

1038
00:54:47,913 --> 00:54:51,314
Tonight a special
"Megan is Missing" reenactment

1039
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:54,683
based on analysis of the original
security camera footage.

1040
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,711
We must warn you that some material

1041
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:59,849
may be too intense for younger viewers.

1042
00:54:59,891 --> 00:55:02,451
Well, we're filming the reenactment
of an abduction

1043
00:55:02,494 --> 00:55:05,520
and we're doing it actually
on the exact location

1044
00:55:05,564 --> 00:55:07,555
where the girl was abducted.

1045
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,195
You want to find the truth
and we believe an accurate reenactment

1046
00:55:12,237 --> 00:55:15,673
in the same location
might bring about some clues

1047
00:55:15,707 --> 00:55:19,040
that the police really haven't
been able to touch on themselves.

1048
00:55:19,077 --> 00:55:21,739
I-- I just-- I think
this is so important.

1049
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,511
And I want to do anything
I could do to help out.

1050
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:28,644
I mean I can't even imagine
that this happened.

1051
00:55:28,687 --> 00:55:31,281
It is difficult playing
someone as awful as this,

1052
00:55:31,323 --> 00:55:34,486
but you look past your personal feelings

1053
00:55:34,526 --> 00:55:36,494
and just try to make it real
for the audience.

1054
00:55:36,528 --> 00:55:39,497
When I was a lot younger I spent
a lot of time on the internet.

1055
00:55:39,531 --> 00:55:41,055
It's not a safe space.

1056
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:44,660
As much as you feel safe
in your own home, you're not safe.

1057
00:55:44,703 --> 00:55:48,503
And now a "Megan is Missing"
exclusive reenactment.

1058
00:55:50,509 --> 00:55:52,500
Hey, Mom, it's me.
I'm going to go to the store

1059
00:55:52,544 --> 00:55:54,171
and get some groceries for breakfast.

1060
00:55:54,212 --> 00:55:56,976
So I'll see you soon. Bye.

1061
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:02,719
(echoing) You're trespassing.

1062
00:56:02,754 --> 00:56:04,745
Come with me.

1063
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:11,220
Stop! No, please! Please!

1064
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:16,200
Stop! Stop! (screaming)

1065
00:56:23,575 --> 00:56:26,271
The brutal abduction
of a beautiful young girl.

1066
00:56:26,311 --> 00:56:27,801
We'll be right back.

1067
00:57:03,615 --> 00:57:06,948
It's been three weeks now.

1068
00:57:06,985 --> 00:57:10,113
I can feel the people searching
for Megan are starting to give up.

1069
00:57:10,155 --> 00:57:12,146
They're not trying anymore

1070
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:15,455
and it's really hard to get volunteers.

1071
00:57:17,262 --> 00:57:19,730
I think that they might
think she's dead.

1072
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,327
Maybe I do too.

1073
00:57:39,117 --> 00:57:42,450
Tonight a shocking twist
in the case of Megan Stewart.

1074
00:57:42,487 --> 00:57:46,480
The missing girl's best friend,
Amy Herman, has now vanished.

1075
00:57:46,525 --> 00:57:48,755
Are the girls the victims
of the same kidnapper

1076
00:57:48,793 --> 00:57:50,727
or have they simply run away together?

1077
00:57:50,762 --> 00:57:53,287
Detective Jon Simonelli had this to say.

1078
00:57:53,331 --> 00:57:55,765
Obviously the coincidence of both girls,

1079
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,268
who were friends,
disappearing is enormous.

1080
00:57:58,303 --> 00:58:00,863
We're working all possible
scenarios at this time.

1081
00:58:00,906 --> 00:58:04,774
A baffling case that grows
more bizarre by the hour.

1082
00:58:04,809 --> 00:58:06,674
We'll be right back.

1083
00:58:09,414 --> 00:58:11,575
It has been two days
since the disappearance

1084
00:58:11,616 --> 00:58:14,813
of 15-year-old Amy Herman and 23 days

1085
00:58:14,853 --> 00:58:18,584
since her best friend Megan Stewart
was abducted behind a local diner.

1086
00:58:18,623 --> 00:58:21,490
Their friends have started a campaign
to persuade everyone

1087
00:58:21,526 --> 00:58:24,859
to tie pink ribbons on trees
as a symbol of hope.

1088
00:58:26,331 --> 00:58:28,196
We're doing this pink ribbon campaign

1089
00:58:28,233 --> 00:58:30,428
to let Megan know that we love her
and we miss her.

1090
00:58:30,468 --> 00:58:33,096
And hopefully it'll make
whoever took her, you know,

1091
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:34,799
feel bad and let her go.

1092
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:36,898
Yvette: Search parties
continue to examine

1093
00:58:36,942 --> 00:58:39,069
the wooded area surrounding
the two girls' homes

1094
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:41,578
for any leads as to their whereabouts.

1095
00:58:41,613 --> 00:58:44,343
Earlier today I spoke
with Amy's parents.

1096
00:58:44,382 --> 00:58:46,407
We'd like to thank all the volunteers

1097
00:58:46,451 --> 00:58:51,388
that have spent so many hours
searching for Amy.

1098
00:58:51,423 --> 00:58:54,881
We believe in our hearts that she's well

1099
00:58:54,926 --> 00:58:57,690
and that she will be
returned to us.

1100
00:58:57,729 --> 00:59:00,755
Princess, if you can--
if you can hear me,

1101
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:04,633
we love you and we're praying for you.

1102
00:59:15,246 --> 00:59:17,942
Chief, we've got something here.

1103
00:59:17,983 --> 00:59:21,384
Frank, get the camera.
Get the camera, Frank.

1104
00:59:21,419 --> 00:59:24,445
Man: Tell those guys to stop.
Hold up. Hold up right there.

1105
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:54,478
(no audible dialogue)

1106
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:14,028
- (Amy screams)
- (banging)

1107
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:19,135
Help! Somebody help!

1108
01:00:19,177 --> 01:00:23,204
Somebody please! Please!

1109
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:27,810
Please help! (crying)

1110
01:00:27,852 --> 01:00:32,653
Please, help me! Help me!

1111
01:00:36,728 --> 01:00:40,494
Why are you doing this to me?

1112
01:00:40,532 --> 01:00:42,056
Please.

1113
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,261
Where is Megan?

1114
01:00:44,302 --> 01:00:47,533
- Is she here?
- Josh: Yes, she's here.

1115
01:00:47,572 --> 01:00:51,372
I want to see her.
I want to talk to her.

1116
01:00:51,409 --> 01:00:53,536
You'll see her when I say
you can see her.

1117
01:00:53,578 --> 01:00:56,274
You're crazy.

1118
01:00:56,314 --> 01:00:57,804
Let me go!

1119
01:00:57,849 --> 01:01:00,750
I'm going to let you go...

1120
01:01:00,785 --> 01:01:03,515
but only if you behave yourself.

1121
01:01:03,555 --> 01:01:06,422
No. No, I want to go home.

1122
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:09,621
Please let me go home. Please.

1123
01:01:09,661 --> 01:01:11,652
(crying) Please!

1124
01:01:11,696 --> 01:01:15,257
Josh, where are you going? You're crazy!

1125
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:19,236
Please! Josh! Please!

1126
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:22,171
I want to go home!

1127
01:01:22,207 --> 01:01:26,166
(crying)

1128
01:01:26,211 --> 01:01:29,510
Help!

1129
01:01:29,547 --> 01:01:31,378
Help!

1130
01:01:31,416 --> 01:01:33,816
Somebody! No!

1131
01:01:33,852 --> 01:01:36,878
(whimpers) You're crazy!

1132
01:01:36,921 --> 01:01:39,446
My name's not Josh, bitch.

1133
01:01:39,491 --> 01:01:41,322
(pail clatters)

1134
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,759
You're crazy!

1135
01:01:47,565 --> 01:01:51,001
Amy: No! No!

1136
01:01:51,035 --> 01:01:54,095
No! Help me!

1137
01:01:54,139 --> 01:01:57,700
Help me! Please!

1138
01:01:57,742 --> 01:02:00,768
Help! Somebody, please!

1139
01:02:00,812 --> 01:02:03,372
Can you hear me?

1140
01:02:03,414 --> 01:02:05,006
Some--

1141
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:28,762
(crying)

1142
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:46,017
Josh: Dinner time.

1143
01:02:46,057 --> 01:02:49,117
You have to eat your dinner
if you want to stay healthy.

1144
01:02:51,796 --> 01:02:54,492
Mm-hmm.

1145
01:03:11,549 --> 01:03:13,915
- Billy!
- Mm, you want teddy?

1146
01:03:13,952 --> 01:03:16,716
Please please. Please let me--

1147
01:03:16,754 --> 01:03:19,518
Eat your food and you can have teddy.

1148
01:03:20,892 --> 01:03:23,986
Eat your food and you can have teddy.

1149
01:03:24,028 --> 01:03:26,428
No, not with your hands.

1150
01:03:26,464 --> 01:03:29,092
Eat from the bowl. That's it.

1151
01:03:31,936 --> 01:03:34,063
You want your teddy bear?

1152
01:03:37,075 --> 01:03:39,509
- Please.
- Eat your food.

1153
01:03:39,544 --> 01:03:41,535
(crying)

1154
01:03:49,354 --> 01:03:52,050
Why are you doing this?

1155
01:03:53,191 --> 01:03:55,182
Josh: Eat.

1156
01:03:57,328 --> 01:03:59,057
Good girl.

1157
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:15,370
(crying)

1158
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,848
(Amy coughing)

1159
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:03,623
(door opens)

1160
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:07,119
(Amy whimpers)

1161
01:05:07,165 --> 01:05:09,656
Am I going home?

1162
01:05:09,701 --> 01:05:12,693
Please. Please let me go home, please.

1163
01:05:12,737 --> 01:05:16,639
(chains rattling)

1164
01:05:16,674 --> 01:05:18,665
Where am I going?

1165
01:05:21,713 --> 01:05:23,908
Where am I going?

1166
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:25,939
Am I going home?

1167
01:05:27,418 --> 01:05:30,251
No no no.

1168
01:05:31,656 --> 01:05:35,717
No. Ow, no.

1169
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,457
No no.

1170
01:05:39,497 --> 01:05:41,931
Ahh!

1171
01:05:47,372 --> 01:05:50,773
(crying, screaming)

1172
01:05:50,808 --> 01:05:53,038
No!

1173
01:05:57,248 --> 01:06:00,149
No! Stop!

1174
01:06:00,184 --> 01:06:02,175
Ahh ahh!

1175
01:06:08,793 --> 01:06:11,284
Ow ow.

1176
01:06:23,975 --> 01:06:26,967
(Josh grunting)

1177
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:37,310
(crying subsides)

1178
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:50,199
(grunting continues)

1179
01:07:08,152 --> 01:07:11,144
(Josh panting)

1180
01:07:31,075 --> 01:07:33,669
(door creaks)

1181
01:07:33,711 --> 01:07:36,475
(chains rattling)

1182
01:07:41,953 --> 01:07:45,616
(door closes, latch clanks)

1183
01:08:23,394 --> 01:08:25,487
Wake up, princess.

1184
01:08:29,667 --> 01:08:31,726
Time to get up.

1185
01:08:33,538 --> 01:08:35,199
What are you doing?

1186
01:08:35,239 --> 01:08:38,402
It's all right. Don't be afraid.

1187
01:08:38,442 --> 01:08:41,036
- Am I going home?
- You want to go home?

1188
01:08:41,078 --> 01:08:45,139
- Yes. Yes, please.
- Would you like that, Amy?

1189
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,583
You want to see your mommy and daddy?

1190
01:08:47,618 --> 01:08:48,812
Yes.

1191
01:08:48,853 --> 01:08:51,083
You want to see Mommy and Daddy again?

but I love you, Josh.

1226

I love you.

Please don't do this to me. I love you.

(crying)

1229
01:10:53,277 --> 01:10:55,871
We could love each other.

1230
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:02,244
We could run away together.

1231
01:11:04,055 --> 01:11:06,285
(sniffles)

1232
01:11:07,825 --> 01:11:10,020
Can't you see it?

1233
01:11:11,829 --> 01:11:14,195
I'll be with you forever.

1234
01:11:15,933 --> 01:11:18,367
Please, you have to let me
out of here...

1235
01:11:22,073 --> 01:11:25,839

(coughing)

1237
01:11:33,517 --> 01:11:35,883
Why?

1238
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,445
Why are you doing this?

1239
01:11:40,358 --> 01:11:44,294
I said I was sorry and I mean it. I--

1240
01:11:44,328 --> 01:11:47,263
I'm-- I'm really sorry.

1241

I've got my whole life

1243
01:12:00,277 --> 01:12:03,405
Let me out.

1244
01:12:03,447 --> 01:12:05,108

and I'll kiss you whenever you want.

1249
01:12:20,798 --> 01:12:23,323
What do you want me to do?

1250
01:12:25,336 --> 01:12:28,772
(coughs, sniffles)

1251
01:12:28,806 --> 01:12:31,775

I'm so sorry for everything I did.

1255
01:12:43,888 --> 01:12:46,982
I don't know what to tell you.

1256
01:12:48,626 --> 01:12:51,026
(crying)

1257
01:12:51,061 --> 01:12:55,327
(coughing, gagging)

1258
01:12:55,366 --> 01:12:59,302
Can you hear me?

1259
01:12:59,336 --> 01:13:01,827
I know you can hear me.

1260
01:13:01,872 --> 01:13:04,067
I know you can.

1261
01:13:05,643 --> 01:13:08,305
I'll be better.

1262
01:13:08,345 --> 01:13:10,472
(crying)

1263
01:13:14,452 --> 01:13:17,888
I'll be the best girlfriend
you'll ever have,

1264
01:13:17,922 --> 01:13:21,619
or the best wife or-- or anything
that you want me to be.

1265

Please, just give me a chance.

1267
01:13:28,365 --> 01:13:31,698

Josh.

1271
01:13:49,253 --> 01:13:52,518
What do you want me to do?

1272
01:13:52,556 --> 01:13:57,186
(crying) What do you want me to do?

1273
01:13:57,228 --> 01:13:59,526
I'll prove it.

1274
01:13:59,563 --> 01:14:02,396
I'll do anything--
anything in the whole world.

1275

I'll do anything.

1276

I'll never call my family again.

1277

I don't need Billy.
I won't ever want him again.

1278
01:14:13,611 --> 01:14:16,205
I won't ever ask for him.

1279
01:14:16,247 --> 01:14:18,943
I'll eat anything you give me.

1280
01:14:20,584 --> 01:14:21,573
I don't care.

1281
01:14:21,619 --> 01:14:25,146
(water sloshing)

1282
01:14:25,189 --> 01:14:26,679
Just open it once.

01:14:26,724 --> 01:14:30,888
Please, just-- just open it once?

1284
01:14:30,928 --> 01:14:33,726

has ever told you that, but I mean it.

1288

I really do.

You're my master? You're the king?

1299

Well, you are. It's true.

1300

Everything I'm saying is true.

1301

You don't want this to happen.

You don't want me--
you don't want me to die.

1312

You'll be left all alone.

1313

01:20:01,892 --> 01:20:03,792
(crying)

1372
01:20:03,827 --> 01:20:06,159
Help me.

1373
01:20:08,031 --> 01:20:10,829
(crying)

1374
01:20:11,969 --> 01:20:14,802
No! Help!

1375
01:20:16,173 --> 01:20:18,767
Please.

1376
01:20:18,809 --> 01:20:21,801
(faint screaming)

1377
01:20:24,181 --> 01:20:26,945
Somebody, please!

1378
01:20:29,152 --> 01:20:31,518
(Josh grunting)

1379
01:20:36,293 --> 01:20:38,284
(grunts)

1380
01:20:39,963 --> 01:20:42,955
(panting)

1381
01:22:41,518 --> 01:22:43,247
Goes mommy-- daddy shark, right?

1382
01:22:43,286 --> 01:22:45,151
So daddy shark?
I only know grandpa shark.

1383
01:22:45,188 --> 01:22:46,553
But I don't know how it goes.
How does it go?

1384
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:49,787
Okay, it goes ♪ Dad-- mommy shark,
do do do, do do do ♪

1385
01:22:49,826 --> 01:22:52,659
-♪ Grandpa shark, do do do, do do do. ♪
- (laughing)

1386
01:22:52,696 --> 01:22:55,028
- I don't know any other ones.
- And then the sharks eat you.

1387
01:22:55,065 --> 01:22:57,431
- No, the sharks don't eat you.
- Yeah, they do.

1388
01:22:57,467 --> 01:23:00,095
I don't know who taught you,
but you don't learn right.

1389
01:23:00,137 --> 01:23:01,627
- I don't learn right?
- Yeah.

1390
01:23:01,671 --> 01:23:03,229
- I learn just fine.
- Sure, you do.

1391
01:23:03,273 --> 01:23:05,104
I learn differently than you do.

1392
01:23:05,142 --> 01:23:06,939
- Smelling your hair?
- Mm-hmm.

1393
01:23:06,977 --> 01:23:08,569
- (laughing)
- My hair smells good.

1394
01:23:08,612 --> 01:23:11,775
What does it smell like?
What does it smell like in French?

1395
01:23:11,815 --> 01:23:13,976
- It smells so good I can't even--
- What does it smell like in French?

1396
01:23:14,017 --> 01:23:17,248
- Like flowers.
- Ha!

1397
01:23:18,989 --> 01:23:20,980
Mm.

1398
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:24,218
- You're crazy.
- You're crazy.

1399
01:23:24,261 --> 01:23:28,891
- Yeah, I guess we're both crazy.
- Mm.

1400
01:23:28,932 --> 01:23:30,957
So what do you want to be
when you grow up?

1401
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:32,935
I am grown up, you dork.

1402
01:23:32,969 --> 01:23:35,028
You know what I mean-- in the future.

1403
01:23:35,072 --> 01:23:37,267
Uh, I say fuck the future.

1404
01:23:37,307 --> 01:23:38,968
(laughs) What was that movie?

1405
01:23:39,009 --> 01:23:41,341
Where the guy said that
to the other guy and--

1406
01:23:41,378 --> 01:23:42,606
Oh, yeah, and then the guy said...

1407
01:23:42,646 --> 01:23:45,410
Both: "The future fucks you."

1408
01:23:45,449 --> 01:23:47,974
- That was funny.
- Yeah.

1409
01:23:48,018 --> 01:23:50,077
So what do you want to be?

1410
01:23:51,755 --> 01:23:54,383
- I want to be you.
- You don't want to be me.

1411
01:23:54,424 --> 01:23:56,984
Yeah, I do. That'd be so cool.

1412
01:23:57,027 --> 01:23:58,892
- Oh, you think so?
- Mm-hmm.

1413
01:23:58,929 --> 01:24:02,626
- Okay, then I would be you.
- No, you don't want to be me.

1414
01:24:02,666 --> 01:24:04,657
- That'd be boring beyond belief.
- Shut up.

1415
01:24:04,701 --> 01:24:07,169
I'm serious. Boring.

1416
01:24:07,204 --> 01:24:09,604
Well, at least your mom and dad
are around and they love you.

1417
01:24:09,639 --> 01:24:11,937
I'm sure your mom loves you too.

1418
01:24:14,244 --> 01:24:17,042
I think we're going to have
amazing lives.

1419
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,638
- Really?
- Yeah.

1420
01:24:18,682 --> 01:24:20,673
We're going to go to different countries

1421
01:24:20,717 --> 01:24:22,548
and eat strange foods

1422
01:24:22,586 --> 01:24:24,986
just like all those dorky
TV channels you watch.

1423
01:24:25,021 --> 01:24:27,683
- Documentary channels aren't dorky.
- Okay, if you say so.

1424
01:24:27,724 --> 01:24:29,521
- Shut up.
- (laughs)

1425
01:24:29,559 --> 01:24:33,290
And we're going to meet guys
with strange foreign accents,

1426
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:38,324
handsome dangerous guys who are like
international spies or something.

1427
01:24:38,368 --> 01:24:41,531
- Amy: In Venice, Italy.
- Why Venice?

1428
01:24:41,571 --> 01:24:43,766
Well, it's more romantic than Texas.

1429
01:24:43,807 --> 01:24:45,297
- Fuck you!
- (laughs)

1430
01:24:45,342 --> 01:24:48,038
It was all I could think of
at the time, okay?

1431
01:24:48,078 --> 01:24:51,741
- (laughs)
- Meg?

1432
01:24:51,781 --> 01:24:53,271
Do you really think I'll meet someone...

1433
01:24:53,316 --> 01:24:54,374
- Yeah, you will.
- ...someday?

1434
01:24:54,417 --> 01:24:56,476
- Yeah.
- When?

1435
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:59,318
It'll happen. Don't rush it.

1436
01:24:59,356 --> 01:25:02,450
Well, you meet guys all the time.

1437
01:25:02,492 --> 01:25:04,517
Not the right ones.

1438
01:25:04,561 --> 01:25:06,654
How do you know what the right one is?

1439
01:25:08,165 --> 01:25:09,928
- He'll be honest.
- Mm-hmm.

1440
01:25:09,966 --> 01:25:12,093
He'll treat me like I'm special.

1441
01:25:12,135 --> 01:25:14,763
He'll be a little shy,
but he'll be cool, so...

1442
01:25:14,804 --> 01:25:16,396
I don't know. I'll just know.

1443
01:25:16,439 --> 01:25:19,704
We'll know when the right guy
comes along.

1444
01:25:19,743 --> 01:25:23,042
- Okay.
- (both chuckle)
