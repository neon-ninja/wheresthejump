1
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:19,520


2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,908
The 117 citizens of Roano Secretary Island suddenly disappeared.

3
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:37,204
The island left a mystery letter, <>

4
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,085
Year 1872, Alantic Ocean.

5
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,506
The Mary Sylas was found floating in the middle of the ocean.
All of it's crew were missing.

6
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:51,510
These few words were hurriedly written down in the ship's log :
4th December. My wife, Mary.

7
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,918
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing.

8
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,212
- You?
- Same.

9
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,298
- Continue searching.
- Yes.

10
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,017
Careful!

11
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,612
This island sure freaks me out.

12
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,907
But this island is also part of Japan.

13
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,701
Where did all the island's people go?

14
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,205
You guys check over there. Quickly.

15
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,582
Let's go this way.

16
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,884
Come on.

17
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,108
Go in.

18
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,613
Forward.

19
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,001
What the hell is this?

20
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,009
It's still warm.

21
00:02:56,802 --> 00:03:00,722
Not only this. The rest of the things in this house are the same.

22
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,183
Captain. Come in.

23
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,395
- What?
- There is someone. From the island.

24
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,398
We found someone on the outside. Come quick!

25
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,687
- Is he alone?
- Yes.

26
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,397
Where are the others?

27
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,691
I can't hear what he is saying.

28
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,485
You. Tell me where are the others.

29
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,991
Where did the others for this island go?

30
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,287
Tell me. What happened on this island?

31
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,289
Siren.

32
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:09,583
What?

33
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,793
Three times.

34
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,422
The third warning.

35
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,303
There is no choice. Take him away.

36
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,598
Danger!

37
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,185
You can't go outside.

38
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:35,400
When the siren sounds, you can't go outside.

39
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,610
What?

40
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,405
When the siren sounds, you can't go outside.

41
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:44,493
When the siren sounds, you can't go outside.

42
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,496
When the siren sounds, you can't go outside.

43
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,290
When the siren sounds, you can't......

44
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:29,997
Forbidden Siren

45
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,394
Are you still thinking of Tokyo?

46
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:00,819
I understand your feelings, this is only temporary.

47
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:05,616
I understand. Its for Hideo.

48
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,286
Heard it's a new house

49
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,499
provided by the company.

50
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,003
Its quite a big isolated house.

51
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,004
Isolated?

52
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,298
From what I heard.

53
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:25,302
It comes with all the furniture and a big garden.

54
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,598
Its something that Tokyo could never have.

55
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,315
Hideo, don't run around.

56
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:43,195
You will get sick if you do.

57
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,200
Hideo.

58
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,624
It would be great if he could run around freely.

59
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,505
Look!

60
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,800
Is that it?

61
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,719
Yame Island.

62
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,690
Excuse me, is Minamida here?

63
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,194
I am Minamida, sorry for coming late.

64
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,404
Sorry to disturb.

65
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:12,492
This is Minamida from the local clinic.

66
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,995
Nice to meet you.

67
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,496
Sorry to trouble you.

68
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,501
Say hello to uncle.

69
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,589
My apologies. Hideo.

70
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,716
Hideo.

71
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,721
The university hospital already informed me.

72
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,808
The child is better than I expected.

73
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:42,606
But can he get better just by staying on the island?

74
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,487
Don't run around, you'll get sick.

75
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,115
Hideo.

76
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,118
Wait.

77
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,895
This doesn't look like Japan. This Yame Island.

78
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,316
I heard a big part of it is history.

79
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:12,404
The people that came to Japan a hundred years ago

80
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,906
started gathering on this island.

81
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,407
Hideo.

82
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:22,206
After the war, this was the American soldiers' burial ground

83
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,791
It affected this place a little.

84
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,294
That makes sense.

85
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,593
Hideo. Come.

86
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,390
We will be leaving.

87
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,615
On the left is where you will be staying.

88
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,591
I'll see you later at the clinic.

89
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,512
Thank you. Sorry to trouble you.

90
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,500
Dad.

91
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,921
We should at least buy some new furniture.

92
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,216
Why? All these furniture can still be used.

93
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:41,220
We are not staying for long anyway.

94
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,317
Hideo. Stop fooling around.

95
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,487
Take out your own luggage.

96
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

97
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,408
Osnan.

98
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,791
Is something the matter?

99
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,720
I'm sorry, let me help you with these.

100
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,890
It's alright, we're neighbours anyway.

101
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,393
Why would you come such a secluded place?

102
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:57,606
A change of environment, for my brother.

103
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,025
Oh, must be hard.

104
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,612
If you need to know anything about the island, feel free to ask me.

105
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,114
Thanks a lot.

106
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,494
Coming from Tokyo, you might not know this.

107
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:13,622
On this island, everyone's relationship is very good.

108
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:15,999
I see.

109
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,713
Also, don't go out at night.

110
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,423
Especially the metal tower in the forest.

111
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,427
There are wild beasts around, very dangerous.

112
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,516
Oh yeah, one more thing.

113
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:36,103
When the siren sounds, don't go out.

114
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,690
Siren? What's that about?

115
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,610
Its nothing much, just an old island's folklore.

116
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:48,490
But its also the islanders rule.

117
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,701
Is that right?

118
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:58,500
The child has been hardworking all along.

119
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:03,505
The neighbour has also been very helpful.

120
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,217
Correct.

121
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:14,016
Life... No problem.

122
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,812
All the house's furniture are in check.

123
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:23,692
Beautiful sunlight.

124
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,696
The ocean's smell.

125
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,116
Wonderful

126
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,995
No problems.

127
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,999
The draft will be done soon.

128
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,213
From today onwards,

129
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:48,217
I will keep a close eye.

130
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,517
That's all for today.

131
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:59,728
Let's observe for a while.

132
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,813
Alright.

133
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,318
Hideo.

134
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,322
I have something to talk to the doctor about. Will you wait outside for me?

135
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,411
Don't go too far.

136
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,626
I can stop worrying now.

137
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,796
Hideo is afraid of doctors.

138
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:29,091
But he seems to like you.

139
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,594
Is that right? That's great.

140
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,305
Doctor.

141
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:39,309
Will he really recover?

142
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,603
But before this...

143
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:45,524
Don't forget, this isn't Tokyo.

144
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:47,526
Let us cure him slowly.

145
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:50,612
This island has its own timing.

146
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:54,408
I'm very worried.

147
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,703
I don't know if he will be cured on this island.

148
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:02,416
Actually, the people on this island

149
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:06,420
are more introverted. They might seem a little cold.

150
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,715
But they are not bad people.

151
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:13,093
Yuki, you will start to like this place.

152
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,511
That's good to hear.

153
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:18,515
Don't worry, I'm here if you need me.

154
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,309
Wind?

155
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:25,606
The wind in this place has a sound.

156
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:31,403
Is it because of this island's complicated geography,

157
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,615
that causes the wind to have a sound?

158
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,326
Maybe,

159
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:41,330
it will be taken away.

160
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:43,499
Taken away?

161
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,711
Where does the sound come from?

162
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:51,507
From near the metal tower,

163
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:55,511
but very few people from the island have been there.

164
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:59,515
It's dangerous there.

165
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:10,609
- Pay respects

166
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:17,491
- Inside the precious mirror

167
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:24,498
- Is the real reason

168
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:36,593
- Only the transparent mirror

169
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:43,725
- The dogs will become Gods

170
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:51,191
- The living will become evil

171
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:33,400
Hideo. Hideo,

172
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:41,617
Hideo.

173
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:10,229
What happened...

174
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:15,317
Why isn't there anyone...

175
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,418
Hideo.

176
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:46,598
Hideo.

177
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,902
Hideo, quit fooling around.

178
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,721
Hideo! Where are you?

179
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:31,203
Year 1976. Interview dairy.

180
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,794
Wind's here. Siren will sound.

181
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:39,711
Second time the siren sounded on the island.

182
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:45,592
Sound is like a police siren.

183
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:50,222
The meaning of the siren.

184
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:58,522
Fisherman's tale.

185
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:00,107
Fear watches over the islanders.

186
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,902
The siren comes from the metal tower?

187
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:08,031
August, 2nd. Late night.

188
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:11,702
In the middle of a blackout.

189
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:15,706
After the third siren, the island started to change.

190
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,628
What are you doing here.

191
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:27,926
Siren.

192
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,098
When the siren sounds, you cannot leave the house.

193
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:34,308
Let me go!

194
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:37,728
You can't leave the house.

195
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:03,712
Hideo.

196
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,727
Why did you come here?

197
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,511
- It's only inside the precious mirror

198
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,809
- The real truth

199
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:46,106
- Only the transparent mirror

200
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,233
Hideo, stop singing this kind of songs.

201
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:53,614
What happened?

202
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:59,203
It's nothing.

203
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:05,334
You're going out?

204
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:11,507
I want to take some night shots in the forest.

205
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,509
I see...

206
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,804
The metal tower is dangerous. Do be careful.

207
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:22,226
I will be back by morning... You go ahead and sleep.

208
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,399
I'm leaving.

209
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:04,226
Impossible.

210
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:34,506
Come over here...

211
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:37,009
Come over here.

212
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:37,926
Hello?

213
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,803
Who is this?

214
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:43,807
We are... Your surroundings.

215
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:47,102
If the siren sounds...

216
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,523
Who is this? Hello? Hello?

217
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:20,010
Hideo.

218
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,519
Siren is sounding, you can't go out.

219
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:31,730
Hideo.

220
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:06,723
Hideo.

221
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,124
What strong winds.

222
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:56,231
Okay.

223
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:27,721
Dad.

224
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,015
Mr. Amano.

225
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:34,728
Dad.

226
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:42,319
Even the islanders will get lost in the forest at night.

227
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,030
I hope nothing has happened to him.

228
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:48,700
Have you reported this?

229
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:50,702
I did.

230
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:54,706
But they said it wasn't very serious,

231
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:57,709
and that he will be back soon.

232
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:00,838
Let's just wait.

233
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:03,799
Do you want to ask the islanders to search together?

234
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:05,926
No.

235
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:08,011
Why not?

236
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:12,015
I keep getting the feeling

237
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:16,019
that the islanders cannot be trusted.

238
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:24,027
Siren.

239
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
It must be because Dad went out when the siren was sounding.
Someone told me
that when the siren was sounding, you must not go outside.

240
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,798
Doctor?

241
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:50,637
Doctor Minamida?

242
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:56,310
Doctor Minamida?

243
00:32:57,728 --> 00:32:59,521
Dad.

244
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:16,014
What's that?

245
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:20,018
What.

246
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:32,216
Look at the mirror...

247
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:34,510
Dog is God.

248
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:37,137
Life is evil.

249
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,014
Unchanger.

250
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:41,725
Immortality through life.

251
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,602
Dog.

252
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:44,520
Life.

253
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,116
Who's there?

254
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

255
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:48,709
Dad.

256
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,018
Wait.

257
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:10,230
Don't be alarmed. It's me.

258
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:15,027
Where did you go? You made me so worried.

259
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:17,029
You...

260
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:51,605
Are you sure it was over there?

261
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:19,007
Doctor. Come over here for a while.

262
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:24,304
Is it there?

263
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,716
Dad.

264
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:54,228
You're here.

265
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:03,904
I tripped and fell real bad.

266
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:08,742
Luckily, I had only minor injuries.

267
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:15,332
Were you worried?

268
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,628
Yeah.

269
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:22,714
Sorry to let you worry.

270
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:45,112
Hideo, it's your sister.

271
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:47,614
Please be quiet.

272
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:09,928
Hideo.

273
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:16,435
Sister will protect you.

274
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:46,131
Osnan?

275
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:52,638
Osnan?

276
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:05,234
Dad.

277
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:07,402
Have you seen Osnan?

278
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:16,036
I don't know.

279
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:18,705
Osnan?

280
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:43,814
This is Dad's.

281
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:25,043
Is that all?

282
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:29,006
Please take a closer look, Doctor.

283
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:32,134
Dad didn't fall. Someone attacked him.

284
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:33,427
Attacked?

285
00:43:34,428 --> 00:43:36,513
I keep getting the feeling

286
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:40,726
that Dad wasn't normal after he came back.

287
00:43:40,726 --> 00:43:44,313
And Osnan, he has never left like that.

288
00:43:44,938 --> 00:43:46,940
You're just being sensitive.

289
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,525
No.

290
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:52,237
It must have something to do with the siren the other day.

291
00:43:52,738 --> 00:43:53,614
Miss Yuki...

292
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:55,407
What's is it with the siren?

293
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:58,744
After the siren sounds, what is it that will happen?

294
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,913
Its nothing more than the island's folklore.

295
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,123
How about that diary?

296
00:44:04,124 --> 00:44:04,917
Diary?

297
00:44:08,003 --> 00:44:13,133
Something must have happened to Dad.

298
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:15,219
Okay, stay calm.

299
00:44:16,303 --> 00:44:26,313
Tell me more about the diary.

300
00:44:34,613 --> 00:44:37,032
I'm home.

301
00:44:55,634 --> 00:44:57,511
Yame Island

302
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:09,022
The Roanoke Incident.

303
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,820
Mary Sylas Incident.

304
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:18,907
The Missing Incident.

305
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:16,006
A long time ago,

306
00:46:16,423 --> 00:46:18,509
during the 15th Century,

307
00:46:18,926 --> 00:46:23,305
an epidemic disease was brought from a foreign land.

308
00:46:23,305 --> 00:46:26,016
The infected

309
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,727
were isolated on Yame Island.

310
00:46:28,727 --> 00:46:31,522
The frightening disease

311
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:36,026
brought the people of Meiye Island infinite disaster.

312
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:41,532
One by one, the islanders fell

313
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:48,914
and died.

314
00:46:48,914 --> 00:46:52,709
A very long time ago, there was an old saying,

315
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,839
A mermaid's blood and flesh can give you an immortal life.

316
00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:00,217
The people captured the mermaid.

317
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:07,516
The mermaid was eaten clean.

318
00:47:07,516 --> 00:47:10,143
Mermaid's Tale

319
00:47:17,442 --> 00:47:20,946
Sirene.

320
00:47:42,134 --> 00:47:44,136
Year 1976

321
00:47:44,136 --> 00:47:48,515
With the exception of one survivor,

322
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:51,935
the people of Yame Island vanished.

323
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,530
In a middle of a blackout.

324
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:04,114
The third siren.

325
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:08,118
The islanders started to change.

326
00:48:21,715 --> 00:48:24,218
Siren...

327
00:48:25,219 --> 00:48:27,513
The third siren...

328
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:45,614
The siren is sounding, do not go outside.

329
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,032
The siren is sounding, do not go outside.

330
00:48:47,241 --> 00:48:50,410
The siren is sounding, do not go outside.

331
00:48:54,915 --> 00:48:57,626
The siren is sounding, do not......

332
00:49:13,642 --> 00:49:16,144
The only survivor

333
00:49:16,144 --> 00:49:18,939
commited sucide afterwards.

334
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,428
Hideo.

335
00:49:54,016 --> 00:49:55,517
Come here quick.

336
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:58,020
Leave that person alone.

337
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,521
Hurry.

338
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,214
Siren.

339
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:29,218
Hideo.

340
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:36,016
Hideo.

341
00:51:07,548 --> 00:51:10,217
His forehead is hot...

342
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:19,810
Mirror.

343
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:24,022
Dog is God.

344
00:51:24,731 --> 00:51:27,025
Living is evil.

345
00:51:27,442 --> 00:51:30,320
Only those who don't change

346
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,322
will lead an immortal life,

347
00:51:33,448 --> 00:51:36,827
and live beyond the human world.

348
00:51:45,419 --> 00:51:47,629
The siren is sounding, do not go outside.

349
00:51:47,921 --> 00:51:49,548
You will be eaten by them.

350
00:51:52,926 --> 00:51:54,845
They are here.

351
00:51:57,931 --> 00:52:05,022
They are here.

352
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:07,232
Don't come in here.

353
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,542
You will be eaten.

354
00:52:25,626 --> 00:52:26,543
Run!

355
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,546
Stop the siren!

356
00:53:11,713 --> 00:53:13,549
Hideo.

357
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:20,931
Hideo, do you like sister?

358
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,517
Do you trust sister?

359
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:28,021
That's good. Listen well.

360
00:53:28,313 --> 00:53:30,524
We'll hide in the ship at the harbour.

361
00:53:30,524 --> 00:53:34,945
We will leave this island first thing in the morning.

362
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:37,114
Leave this frightening place.

363
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:40,534
Hideo hates this place too, right?

364
00:53:40,826 --> 00:53:43,328
Then, listen to sister...

365
00:53:44,913 --> 00:53:48,917
Sister will protect you...

366
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:33,212
Dad.

367
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:37,716
The photo taken after the islanders dissapearance.

368
00:54:58,612 --> 00:55:00,823
This house...

369
00:57:08,951 --> 00:57:11,537
It can't be...

370
00:57:14,122 --> 00:57:16,750
All the islanders are...

371
00:57:30,931 --> 00:57:34,726
It's coming... The siren.

372
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,738
Hideo.

373
00:57:51,618 --> 00:57:53,245
Hideo.

374
00:57:58,417 --> 00:57:59,543
Who's that?

375
00:58:08,343 --> 00:58:10,512
What are you doing here!

376
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:43,921
Dad!

377
01:01:03,936 --> 01:01:05,521
Dad!

378
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

379
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:09,626
Don't!

380
01:02:10,836 --> 01:02:12,838
Don't come over here!

381
01:02:59,051 --> 01:03:02,054
Policeman. Help!

382
01:03:02,638 --> 01:03:05,724
Help!

383
01:03:54,815 --> 01:03:56,942
No place to hide.

384
01:03:57,526 --> 01:04:00,946
Where should we run...

385
01:04:05,534 --> 01:04:07,619
The metal tower.

386
01:04:16,628 --> 01:04:19,923
The siren is coming from the tower?

387
01:04:30,434 --> 01:04:32,019
Are you okay?

388
01:04:32,019 --> 01:04:34,855
Yuki, where are you?

389
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:41,236
Miss Yuki...

390
01:04:51,622 --> 01:04:53,415
Come out...

391
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:10,516
Are you over here...

392
01:05:25,447 --> 01:05:28,617
Ah. I found you.

393
01:06:53,952 --> 01:06:54,620
Hideo.

394
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:57,623
Don't let go no matter what. Close your eyes.

395
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

396
01:09:34,822 --> 01:09:37,741
What is that?

397
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:15,237
Hideo, don't fall down.

398
01:10:15,237 --> 01:10:17,030
Turn around.

399
01:10:17,739 --> 01:10:19,449
Kneel down.

400
01:10:21,326 --> 01:10:23,245
Hold tight.

401
01:10:23,954 --> 01:10:26,039
Close your eyes.

402
01:11:44,243 --> 01:11:47,120
It's no use. The siren will still sound.

403
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:53,126
Don't come over.

404
01:11:54,044 --> 01:11:56,338
I don't trust you.

405
01:12:21,655 --> 01:12:24,324
There is no siren.

406
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:27,828
It's all in your mind.

407
01:12:29,037 --> 01:12:32,624
Only you can hear the siren.

408
01:12:36,753 --> 01:12:38,630
Yuki, hold my hand.

409
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:41,550
Don't run anymore

410
01:12:44,344 --> 01:12:47,556
I hear it clearly...

411
01:12:47,723 --> 01:12:49,433
Come here.

412
01:12:49,725 --> 01:12:51,852
Hideo.

413
01:12:52,227 --> 01:12:54,229
Don't come over.

414
01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:56,857
Hideo.

415
01:12:57,858 --> 01:13:00,652
Hideo. Hideo...

416
01:13:01,737 --> 01:13:04,031
Hideo is not here anymore.

417
01:13:06,241 --> 01:13:08,243
Hideo...

418
01:13:09,745 --> 01:13:13,123
Hideo died a long time ago.

419
01:13:15,542 --> 01:13:16,335
Hideo. He...

420
01:13:16,335 --> 01:13:17,836
died?

421
01:13:24,843 --> 01:13:26,220
Hideo.

422
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:34,353
Hideo.

423
01:13:38,649 --> 01:13:42,027
Hideo is afraid of doctors.

424
01:13:42,528 --> 01:13:45,030
But he seems to like you.

425
01:13:45,656 --> 01:13:47,324
Is that right?

426
01:13:49,326 --> 01:13:52,746
She's better than I expected.

427
01:13:53,121 --> 01:13:54,748
Yes.

428
01:13:55,249 --> 01:13:58,752
Don't run around, you'll get sick.

429
01:14:01,129 --> 01:14:03,423
Don't run around like that, Hideo.

430
01:14:03,423 --> 01:14:08,220
What if you get sick?

431
01:14:12,224 --> 01:14:13,934
No way...

432
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:17,855
But

433
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:26,738
Hideo and I...

434
01:14:26,738 --> 01:14:30,450
Hideo, I'm your sister.

435
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:40,836
Hideo.

436
01:14:54,933 --> 01:14:57,352
Have you remembered?

437
01:14:57,561 --> 01:15:00,647
Hideo is not here anymore.

438
01:15:01,648 --> 01:15:03,442
Shut up!

439
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:07,154
Yuki, it's dangerous. Come here.

440
01:15:07,321 --> 01:15:09,740
Hurry.

441
01:15:13,952 --> 01:15:15,329
Yuki.

442
01:15:16,121 --> 01:15:17,831
Yuki.

443
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:21,627
Come here quick.

444
01:15:53,534 --> 01:15:55,327
Hideo.

445
01:16:11,343 --> 01:16:13,345
Yuki, it's dangerous.

446
01:16:15,055 --> 01:16:16,723
Come over here quick.

447
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:20,227
Yuki.

448
01:16:21,353 --> 01:16:22,729
It's dangerous.

449
01:16:24,022 --> 01:16:26,942
Yuki, come over here.

450
01:16:28,735 --> 01:16:30,654
Don't go anymore.

451
01:16:32,531 --> 01:16:34,825
It's dangerous, come here quick.

452
01:16:45,961 --> 01:16:47,921
Hurry, Yuki.

453
01:17:16,825 --> 01:17:19,244
Beautiful.

454
01:19:04,349 --> 01:19:06,852
It's a miracle

455
01:19:07,227 --> 01:19:10,522
to survive after falling from such a height.

456
01:19:11,231 --> 01:19:15,027
But

457
01:19:15,027 --> 01:19:19,031
why does she hear the siren?

458
01:19:19,323 --> 01:19:24,661
It's most probably a hallucination.

459
01:19:26,455 --> 01:19:29,124
It was the same 26 years ago.

460
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:33,337
At that time, there was a man that lived on this island

461
01:19:33,545 --> 01:19:38,133
who could also hear the siren

462
01:19:38,133 --> 01:19:41,428
and started murdering the islanders.

463
01:19:42,554 --> 01:19:44,723
You're saying

464
01:19:44,723 --> 01:19:49,728
that's the real reason for the islanders' dissapearances?

465
01:19:49,728 --> 01:19:51,563
So it seems.

466
01:19:52,648 --> 01:19:54,942
But

467
01:19:54,942 --> 01:20:00,739
The people of Yame Island believes that

468
01:20:00,739 --> 01:20:03,033
when the siren sounds

469
01:20:03,033 --> 01:20:05,744
one should never go outside.

470
01:20:09,122 --> 01:20:11,041
What this actually means

471
01:20:11,959 --> 01:20:17,130
is that those who can hear the siren should never go outside.

472
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:21,426
This time we are lucky.

473
01:20:23,637 --> 01:20:28,058
My wife has died a long time ago.

474
01:20:28,058 --> 01:20:30,227
From that time on,

475
01:20:30,853 --> 01:20:34,940
that child has always played her mother's role,

476
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:38,360
taking care of Hideo.

477
01:20:38,735 --> 01:20:41,238
She...

478
01:20:41,238 --> 01:20:46,034
treats Hideo's death as her own fault

479
01:20:46,034 --> 01:20:47,953
thinking it was her own responsibility.

480
01:20:48,662 --> 01:20:52,541
She keeps blaming herself.

481
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:56,545
Hideo's death

482
01:20:56,545 --> 01:20:57,963
was a great blow to her.

483
01:20:59,548 --> 01:21:01,925
My daughter...

484
01:21:01,925 --> 01:21:04,136
will she recover?

485
01:21:06,263 --> 01:21:11,351
Whether she can see her own reality

486
01:21:13,228 --> 01:21:16,231
all depends on her.

487
01:22:31,348 --> 01:22:34,935
- Hell's gate

488
01:22:34,935 --> 01:22:39,940
- has already opened...

489
01:22:53,954 --> 01:22:57,040
The forth siren sounded.

490
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:00,752
I must kill them all!

491
01:23:59,436 --> 02:30:14,495
