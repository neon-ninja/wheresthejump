Okay.

That's a cowboy.

Come on.

00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:45,895

00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:04,735
Rosa?

00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:06,749
<i>Sí.</i>

74
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,155
How are you doing?

75
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,406
Okay, more or less.

76
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:13,535
Just remember it's
1 kg for 2.2 lbs.

77
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:16,396
Okay?

78
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:17,873
I'm here for anything you need.

79
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,828
- Right?
- Right.

80
00:08:21,764 --> 00:08:23,731
- Darius.
- How's she doing?

81
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:25,895
You know, second week
in the country.

82
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,562
The girl's terrified.

83
00:08:27,697 --> 00:08:29,740
She lucky she got you
to walk her through this.

84
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,373
She is, and you're lucky
you have me to run this place.

85
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:34,906
I know I am.

86
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:37,877
The Purge doesn't
release anger.

87
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:40,311
It increases anger.
It's a virus.

88
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:43,112
It's an American-born virus
of hate and rage,

89
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:45,052
and it's injected
with a bullet,

90
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:48,417
and it's spreading,
it's growing, it's mutating.

91
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,281
Turn that off, Adela. Please.

92
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,458
The Purge is coming.

93
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:01,630
Mmm.

94
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:03,366
Mm-hmm.

95
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:10,646
This...

96
00:09:10,781 --> 00:09:12,942
reminds me
of your mother's house.

97
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:18,141
You should give it to Darius
so he can make real Mexican food.

98
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,852
Not those terrible burritos.

99
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:23,021
Juan, please, where are we?

100
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:25,524
You need to practice
your English.

101
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,592
When in Rome.

102
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:29,496
When in America.

103
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:32,265
Just do it for me.

104
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:34,433
Please.

105
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:38,775
The Tucker family would really
appreciate that, believe me.

106
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:42,176
Now that your wife is pregnant,

107
00:09:42,312 --> 00:09:45,175
if you want any extra help,
you're welcome to come by.

108
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:46,976
We could all
lock down together.

109
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:49,785
Oh, I hate the damn Purge.

110
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,151
It's hard to be social
on that night.

111
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:54,184
- But thank you for the invite.
- Anytime.

112
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,025
- Baby, that smells so good.
- Mm.

113
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,658
I'm going to the kitchen.
Y'all need anything?

114
00:09:58,793 --> 00:09:59,861
You want another beer?

115
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:01,862
- Yeah, yeah, I'll take one.
- Another beer.

116
00:10:01,997 --> 00:10:03,695
- Thank you.
- Thank you, honey.

117
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,965
I don't know. I just feel like

118
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,499
a goddamn Hoover these days.

119
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:13,034
Everything in my line of sight
just gets consumed.

120
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,373
Even things I hate.

121
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:18,309
You know, Anna's been
cooking for us

122
00:10:18,444 --> 00:10:21,644
the most amazing Mexican food,
am I right?

123
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,248
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- It's so good but so fattening.

124
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:28,723
- I put on five pounds.
- No, you have not.

125
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:30,028
Mm-hmm.

126
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,196
You know...

127
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,889
Anna has a sister.

128
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:35,326
Also a nanny.

129
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:37,394
- You should meet her.
- Yeah, we're all right.

130
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:40,463
What, baby?

131
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,536
We don't need
to meet her sister.

132
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:44,703
We're fine.

133
00:10:44,838 --> 00:10:47,274
Thank you, though.

134
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,437
Baby, Emily's just trying to be
nice and help out, right?

135
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:51,243
So you're being
a little bit rude.

136
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,512
Oh, was I?

137
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:57,583
My apologies, Emily.

138
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,680
Oh, it's fine.

139
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:02,090
It's just it's really hard
to find good help,

140
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:04,729
- and Anna's sister's a sweetheart.
- Yeah.

141
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,061
We don't need to meet
Anna's sister, Emily.

142
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,732
I don't even know
if I want our kids

143
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:13,399
speaking Spanish in this house.

144
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:17,841
Now, thank you for the offer,
but, no, thank you.

145
00:11:20,037 --> 00:11:21,438
Okay, then.

146
00:11:27,217 --> 00:11:29,620
This is your learn English app.

147
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,583
Lesson 12:
Past tense sentences.

148
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,258
- Past tense sentences.
- Who would've thought

149
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,657
I would be in Texas?

150
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:38,462
Who would've, who would've...

151
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,590
I would be in Texas... Texas?

152
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:44,495
Who would've thought
I would be in Texas?

153
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:49,070
Who would have
thought I would be in Texas?

154
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:52,337
Who... who would have thought

155
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:54,679
I would be in Texas?

156
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,716
I was just visiting
friends in Texas.

157
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:02,115
Repeat after me.

158
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:05,416
I was just visiting friends
in Texas.

159
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:29,011
Hey, Juan.

160
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,679
Kirk tells me that
you were late this morning.

161
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:34,482
I'm never late, sir.

162
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:37,448
You're never late?

163
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:41,288
Hey, Kirk, Juan here
says you're lying.

164
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:43,960
Juan's a free man.
He can say whatever he wants.

165
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:47,492
You know, Juan,
you show up late again,

166
00:12:47,627 --> 00:12:49,398
I'm gonna have to fire you.
That's the rules.

167
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,462
Yes, sir.

168
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,663
Hey, you know
what somebody else told me?

169
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,204
That he found your lariat
just laying

170
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:58,704
in the front of the stable
on the ground.

171
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,506
Is that true?

172
00:13:00,642 --> 00:13:02,176
No, sir.

173
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,868
It's called "La Riata."

174
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:16,419
T.T., your Purge
protection bonus.

175
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:18,856
- Thank you, Mr. Tucker.
- Stay safe.

176
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:19,988
Thank you, sir.

177
00:13:20,123 --> 00:13:21,525
Kirk.

178
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:36,540
You're doing a good job, Juan.

179
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:40,241
My son's a hair rattled
'cause of yesterday.

180
00:13:40,377 --> 00:13:41,912
Don't take offense.

181
00:13:42,047 --> 00:13:43,916
Thank you, sir.

182
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:46,055
I really appreciate that.

183
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:51,357
Can I be honest, Mr. Tucker?

184
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,657
Please do.

185
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:59,127
Your son doesn't like me
because...

186
00:13:59,262 --> 00:14:01,103
I'm Mexican.

187
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:05,141
And I think Dylan believes

188
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:09,109
a cowboy shouldn't be
from <i>México</i> or...

189
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:12,443
Argentina
or from somewhere else.

190
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:14,281
I know that a lot of people
feel that way,

191
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:16,285
but I'm not sure
that's the case with Dylan.

192
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:19,218
Uh, he's a very proud man.
You one-upped him yesterday.

193
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:21,354
You're a damn fine cowboy,
Juan.

194
00:14:23,122 --> 00:14:24,555
I don't know, sir.

195
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:30,995
Well...

196
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,897
I don't know either.

197
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:34,565
I just...

198
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,504
I always taught my son
to be a proud American,

199
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,212
but maybe I didn't really
teach him what that meant.

200
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,447
I don't even know if I know
what that means anymore,

201
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:46,816
proud American.

202
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:48,914
World's changing all around us.

203
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,252
At each other's throats.

204
00:14:53,723 --> 00:14:55,652
Confusing times.

205
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,724
I want to give you...

206
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:07,070
...the goddamn
Purge protection bonus.

207
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:10,238
Stay safe.

208
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:13,241
Thank you.

209
00:15:26,918 --> 00:15:28,786
That money's nothing
but a way for these people

210
00:15:28,922 --> 00:15:31,959
to keep us alive so they can
continue using our slave labor.

211
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,855
We're nothing more than that.

212
00:15:35,498 --> 00:15:37,327
I know what I'm-a use
my money for, though,

213
00:15:37,462 --> 00:15:39,465
and it's not for protection.

214
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:47,698
Crazy man.

215
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:54,816
<i>We are now just one hour away</i>

216
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:56,714
<i>from the annual Purge.</i>

217
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:59,555
<i>As always,
home is the best place to be,</i>

218
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,916
<i>and we sure hope you're not
out there stuck in traffic.</i>

219
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:04,689
<i>We strongly advise you
to get yourself</i>

220
00:16:04,824 --> 00:16:07,154
<i>and those you care about
to a safe place.</i>

221
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,430
<i>So lock those doors,
set those security systems,</i>

222
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:13,368
<i>and stay inside
for the next 12 hours.</i>

223
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:15,871
<i>And for those of you
who are partaking,</i>

224
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:18,501
<i>may God be with you all.</i>

225
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:35,092
It's one hour.

226
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,656
T.T. said he would be here
right now.

227
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:45,201
- He's coming.
- Ay.

228
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:22,339
Spring is
coming, and so is the Purge.

229
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,241
I've decided that I don't want
to be called Granddaddy...

230
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,835
We spoke with
tribal leader Chiago Harjo

231
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,607
- earlier today.
- You had your chance.

232
00:17:27,743 --> 00:17:29,507
Well, what the hell
do you want to be called, Dad?

233
00:17:29,643 --> 00:17:30,844
I want to be called
Grandfather.

234
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:36,451
See, my people have been
watching from the sidelines,

235
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:38,990
and we see that America's
reached a boiling point.

236
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,959
Hatred like that
can't be contained.

237
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,293
You'll burn your cities
to the ground.

238
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:51,968
I'm gonna lock down now, y'all.

239
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,771
- Okay.
- Yeah.

240
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,954
We're almost there, guys.

241
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,189
We're almost there.

242
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,518
Captain.

243
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:26,197
Good to see you.

244
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:29,967
Other half when the job's done?

245
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,569
I know you're good for it, T.T.

246
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:32,961
All right.

247
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:44,106
Make
your way inside. Keep moving.

248
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:47,548
We will not be opening
our doors until 7:00 tomorrow

249
00:19:47,683 --> 00:19:49,077
when the Purge is over.

250
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,233
Are you sure we are
gonna be safe here?

251
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,610
Of course. Trust me.

252
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,240
We're not gonna die
on the first one, right?

253
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,783
Don't jinx it.

254
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:08,709
Get comfortable.
We'll be here for the next 12 hours.

255
00:20:10,404 --> 00:20:12,336
Make yourself at home.

256
00:20:21,244 --> 00:20:22,446
Okay, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

257
00:20:22,582 --> 00:20:23,448
Look at this.

258
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:25,414
Good.

259
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:27,016
Wait, what?

260
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:30,087
- Dang.
- What? How did you know how to do that?

261
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:35,594
The national holiday
celebrating

262
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,593
our American freedom
is finally back.

263
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:40,165
Good night, Texas,

264
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:41,795
and good luck.

265
00:20:44,636 --> 00:20:46,001
It's starting, y'all.

266
00:20:46,136 --> 00:20:48,135
This is not a test.

267
00:20:48,271 --> 00:20:50,645
This is your
Emergency Broadcast System

268
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,809
announcing the commencement
of the annual Purge

269
00:20:52,945 --> 00:20:55,253
sanctioned by
the U.S. government.

270
00:20:55,756 --> 00:21:00,052
Weapons of Class 4 and lower have been
authorized for use during the Purge.

271
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,429
All other weapons
are restricted.

272
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,973
Government officials
of ranking 10...

273
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:06,361
...have been granted immunity

274
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:09,063
from the Purge
and shall not be harmed.

275
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,564
Commencing at the siren,

276
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,095
any and all crime,
including murder...

277
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:15,817
...will be legal for
12 continuous hours.

278
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,655
Police, fire,
and emergency medical services

279
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,698
will be unavailable
until tomorrow morning...

280
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:24,808
...at 7:00 a.m.
when the Purge concludes.

281
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:26,544
Blessed be
our New Founding Fathers

282
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,017
and America, a nation reborn.

283
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:30,886
May God be with you all.

284
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:51,102
Hmm.

285
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:53,233
Well...

286
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,619
Never! Never again!

287
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,199
This reminds me of home, Adela.

288
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,577
This is home now.

289
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:51,538
You know what I mean.

290
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:54,833
Maybe you're right.

291
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,462
Maybe we have to forget
where we came from.

292
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,173
And accept where we are.

293
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:03,909
When in America.

294
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:05,344
Like you said.

295
00:23:06,746 --> 00:23:09,112
No, that's not what I meant.

296
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,814
What did you mean, then?

297
00:23:11,949 --> 00:23:14,790
That America is everything.

298
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,731
What the hell are
you talking about, Adela?

299
00:23:18,053 --> 00:23:20,287
America is <i>México.</i>

300
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:23,258
America is Africa.
America is Italia.

301
00:23:23,393 --> 00:23:27,004
We can take it all,
we can learn it all,

302
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,638
and we can embrace it.

303
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:33,807
You really believe that?

304
00:23:34,876 --> 00:23:36,843
That's what I choose
to believe.

305
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,992
You're so crazy.

306
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,540
Stupid.

307
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

308
00:25:42,405 --> 00:25:43,802
- Baby.
- Jesus.

309
00:25:43,937 --> 00:25:45,803
- What?
- Put the gun down.

310
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:48,269
What are you doing out here?

311
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:51,148
I thought I heard something.

312
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,612
It's this damn night.

313
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:55,249
Dylan Tucker, cut the shit.

314
00:25:55,384 --> 00:25:56,679
Fuck the Purge.

315
00:25:56,815 --> 00:25:58,480
Fuck the NFFA.

316
00:25:58,615 --> 00:26:01,081
They don't get to dictate
how we live our life.

317
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:03,255
This is our country, okay?

318
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:07,660
And we can choose to bring
a baby into a world of love.

319
00:26:07,795 --> 00:26:09,430
Why are you laughing at me?

320
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:11,862
- Damn, honey.
- What?

321
00:26:11,998 --> 00:26:14,000
You just kind of turned me on.

322
00:26:29,618 --> 00:26:30,717
Hurry up!

323
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,070
Ma'am, you should
go back inside.

324
00:26:50,205 --> 00:26:52,905
Just need some air, you know,
just for a moment.

325
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:57,706
It's my first Purge.

326
00:26:57,842 --> 00:27:00,242
- Is it what you expected?
- Well, there's parts of <i>México</i>

327
00:27:00,378 --> 00:27:02,818
that sound like this
every night.

328
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:06,352
We got a nice spot here.

329
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:07,854
Quiet.

330
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:11,387
Good for you,
easy money for us.

331
00:27:11,523 --> 00:27:13,559
You should get back.

332
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:18,801
Three bogeys inbound.

333
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:21,670
Do not try to hide.

334
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,368
We are the real patriots
of America.

335
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:31,079
It is our job to keep this land
free and clean.

336
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:34,345
We will no longer tolerate foreigners

337
00:27:34,481 --> 00:27:38,618
raping and pillaging
the United States of America.

338
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,692
We will find you
and disinfect you.

339
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:48,094
America will be American
once again.

340
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:50,030
Those guys are fucking insane.

341
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:54,104
The purification of America

342
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,963
has begun.

343
00:28:01,945 --> 00:28:03,312
What the fuck are they doing?

344
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,214
Help me! Help!

345
00:28:19,128 --> 00:28:20,557
- I have a clear shot.
- Don't.

346
00:28:20,693 --> 00:28:23,294
You'll start a war and put
all your people in jeopardy.

347
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:25,294
We will not stop until

348
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:28,565
our great nation
has been fully cleansed.

349
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:33,234
We will no longer tolerate
foreigners raping and pillaging

350
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,103
the United States of America.

351
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:38,307
Do not try to hide.

352
00:28:38,442 --> 00:28:42,776
We will find you
and disinfect you.

353
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:47,153
America will be
American once again.

354
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:51,454
Hey.

355
00:28:52,954 --> 00:28:55,557
Where'd you learn
to handle a weapon like that?

356
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:52,655
Oh, my God.

357
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,683
It's over.

358
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:07,061
We made it through.

359
00:30:08,735 --> 00:30:11,369
I see you. I see you.

360
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,087
Harp?
Come on, let's get to work.

361
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:29,926
- Harper.
- Sis, come on, let's go.

362
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:38,200
The day after the Purge
should be a holiday.

363
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,469
No?

364
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:41,436
<i>¿Qué es un holiday?</i>

365
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:43,533
Holiday? Mm.

366
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,262
It's a holy day, a festive day.

367
00:30:47,503 --> 00:30:49,044
Another day, another dollar.

368
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,885
Take it easy.

369
00:30:50,943 --> 00:30:52,607
<i>Mira.</i>

370
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,385
Ah, <i>chingado.</i>

371
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:30,854
...busy, jubilant street,

372
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,121
sanitation crews
are out in full force

373
00:31:33,256 --> 00:31:35,817
with the macabre task
of disinfecting streets

374
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:38,292
and cleaning corpses
from sidewalks and roadways.

375
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:41,593
The Purge is over,
and now the cleanup has begun.

376
00:31:41,729 --> 00:31:44,593
All over the state, violent
incidents ended hours ago...

377
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:46,700
Fake news!

378
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:19,860
Where is everybody?

379
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

380
00:33:06,577 --> 00:33:08,381
What the hell?

381
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

382
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

383
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,480
<i>¡Ayúdenme!</i>

384
00:34:11,615 --> 00:34:12,843
Help!

385
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:17,483
Help!

386
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:22,624
Help!

387
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:33,407
Why is the gate open?

388
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:41,144
Help me.

389
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:44,207
Help!

390
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:45,846
You can't do this today!

391
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:47,150
The Purge is over!

392
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,949
No, no.

393
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:50,543
This is the Forever Purge.

394
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,554
It's never stopping.

395
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,319
<i>¡Ayúdenme!</i>

396
00:34:53,454 --> 00:34:54,490
Thank you
for your participation.

397
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,552
Fuck!

<i>¡Ayúdenme!</i> Help!

Help!
Please!

400
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,070
Boss!

401
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:17,642
Watch out!

402
00:35:20,683 --> 00:35:22,350
You're gonna fucking die!
You're all gonna die!

403
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,049
Help! Boss!

404
00:35:27,716 --> 00:35:29,016
Be careful!

405
00:35:31,321 --> 00:35:32,393
Boss!

406
00:35:33,963 --> 00:35:34,927
Are you okay?

407
00:35:35,062 --> 00:35:36,529
Boss.

408
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:41,200
- You okay?
- Yes.

409
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:42,737
Come here.

410
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:45,206
- You all right?
- Yes.

411
00:35:49,506 --> 00:35:51,372
Fuck you!

412
00:35:51,507 --> 00:35:53,348
Fuck you!

413
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,918
Go! Darius, go!

414
00:36:09,229 --> 00:36:10,796
Drop your weapon!

415
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:13,533
- On your knees. Drop it.
- We didn't do anything.

416
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:14,731
- Get on your knees.
- Get on your knees.

417
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:16,900
- They attacked us!
- We didn't do anything.

418
00:36:17,035 --> 00:36:18,765
The Purge is over, lady.
What the hell are you doing?

419
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:21,443
Sir, this is a mistake!

420
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:23,107
- Wait, please!
- We didn't do anything wrong!

421
00:36:23,243 --> 00:36:24,109
Listen to me.

422
00:36:24,244 --> 00:36:26,579
Listen to us, sir!

423
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:32,755
It's so quiet.

424
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,719
Where is everyone?

425
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:40,117
Look over there.

426
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:41,389
Oh, come on.

427
00:36:41,525 --> 00:36:43,260
Stop the car.

428
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,292
Let's get them before
they go too far.

429
00:36:55,407 --> 00:36:57,247
Well, well, well.

430
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,313
Look at this.

431
00:37:14,562 --> 00:37:16,662
This feels like
fucking Christmas.

432
00:37:17,729 --> 00:37:19,764
Any of y'all get me a present?

433
00:37:21,264 --> 00:37:24,631
Caleb, I know you did,
and let me tell you, sir...

434
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:27,475
I spent your money well.

435
00:37:30,074 --> 00:37:31,807
Today's your day
of reckoning, cowboy.

436
00:37:33,346 --> 00:37:36,680
You become me

437
00:37:36,816 --> 00:37:40,050
and I become you, huh?

438
00:37:40,186 --> 00:37:43,184
The old switcheroo is happening
on every ranch around here.

439
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:46,725
You and all your rich-ass
neighbors will find out

440
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,457
what it's like to be
penniless and powerless.

441
00:37:49,593 --> 00:37:50,795
To be like us!

442
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,894
These rich motherfuckers
can't hide

443
00:37:54,029 --> 00:37:55,567
behind their steel walls
no more.

444
00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:58,732
This is the way
things are now, boys!

445
00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:00,507
This Purge is forever!

446
00:38:00,643 --> 00:38:01,701
Yeah.

447
00:38:01,837 --> 00:38:03,538
This is the real Purge.

448
00:38:03,673 --> 00:38:05,176
The eternal Purge.

449
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:07,477
Ever After!

450
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:09,248
Ever After!

451
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:11,792
It came from the house.

452
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:13,293
Run.

453
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:16,183
<i>Ay, cabrón.</i>

454
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:18,854
I'm gonna give you a chance

455
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,691
to save your family,
Dylan Tucker,

456
00:38:20,827 --> 00:38:24,100
one by one,
but you'll have to pay.

457
00:38:24,236 --> 00:38:26,230
Let's start with

458
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:29,236
eeny, meeny,

459
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:30,767
miny, ho!

460
00:38:30,903 --> 00:38:32,267
How much would you give
for her, Dylan?

461
00:38:32,403 --> 00:38:34,670
How much would you give to
stop me from putting a bullet

462
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:36,905
in your baby sister's head?

463
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:39,745
Let's say ten bucks,
and she lives.

464
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,712
Oh, that seems like
a fair market price

465
00:38:41,848 --> 00:38:43,351
for this broke-down,
useless woman.

466
00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:45,548
Let's see
how much money you got.

467
00:38:45,684 --> 00:38:47,422
Aw, shit, Dylan! I forgot.

468
00:38:47,557 --> 00:38:50,360
You're me now,
which means you're broke.

469
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:53,759
You have no money.
That sucks, doesn't it?

470
00:38:54,825 --> 00:38:58,263
See, Dylan, without money,

471
00:38:58,398 --> 00:39:00,261
you have no power.

472
00:39:00,397 --> 00:39:03,804
Without money, you can't save
your own little sister,

473
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,370
and she will die because of it.

474
00:39:06,506 --> 00:39:09,269
But how's that feel?

475
00:39:10,345 --> 00:39:11,876
How's that feel, Dylan?

476
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:17,046
Feels like shit, doesn't it?

477
00:39:18,054 --> 00:39:19,415
That's my life.

478
00:39:19,551 --> 00:39:20,483
It's our life.

479
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:22,419
That's how we feel.

480
00:39:22,555 --> 00:39:24,954
That's how we have felt

481
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,925
every day
since the day we were born!

482
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,389
And I want you to fucking feel
that fucking pain

483
00:39:29,524 --> 00:39:31,126
in your fucking stomach, Dylan!

484
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:32,332
Goddamn it,
it looks like the old man's

485
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:33,733
got something to say! What?!

486
00:39:33,868 --> 00:39:35,628
Damn it! You're right, Kirk!
You're right!

487
00:39:35,763 --> 00:39:37,405
- You're right!
- I don't give a fuck if you think I'm right!

488
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,905
You're talking about
life in America,

489
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,842
the way the rich get rich
off the backs of the poor,

490
00:39:42,977 --> 00:39:46,642
the way it's been
ever since we robbed this land

491
00:39:46,778 --> 00:39:49,116
from the Native Americans.

492
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:51,786
But you got no right

493
00:39:51,921 --> 00:39:56,421
to complain about the
very system you're supporting

494
00:39:56,556 --> 00:39:57,656
by picking up that gun

495
00:39:57,792 --> 00:39:59,159
and sanctioning
the goddamn Purge...

496
00:39:59,294 --> 00:40:01,022
We need more guns.

497
00:40:01,158 --> 00:40:02,663
...which is all about money.

498
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:09,000
You know who created
the Purge, don't ya?

499
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:14,376
A bunch of fat, rich
businessmen in Washington, D.C.

500
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,111
So what would
that make you, Kirk?

501
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:19,381
What would it make you?

502
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:23,348
Huh? That would make you
their lackey

503
00:40:23,484 --> 00:40:26,116
and a goddamn hypocrite.

504
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:29,620
They expect you to go out there
and do their violence,

505
00:40:29,755 --> 00:40:31,327
so they can play more golf.

506
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:32,660
They've never even been
in a fistfight.

507
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:35,102
You take the guys on the left,
and I'll take the right.

508
00:40:36,626 --> 00:40:38,727
So...

509
00:40:38,862 --> 00:40:41,630
from my family to you,

510
00:40:41,765 --> 00:40:43,833
go fuck yourself.

511
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,677
<i>Puto.</i>

512
00:40:54,979 --> 00:40:56,684
Take cover!

513
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,183
We need backup!

514
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:02,624
Copy that. We're on our way.

515
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,631
Untie them, I'll cover you!

516
00:41:12,398 --> 00:41:14,101
Harper.

517
00:41:15,801 --> 00:41:16,666
What the fuck?!

518
00:41:16,801 --> 00:41:17,836
What the fuck, Kirk?!

519
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:19,832
- Dad?
- The Purge is over, <i>cabrón!</i>

520
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:21,544
Ever After.

521
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,516
The Purge is over, man!

522
00:41:33,688 --> 00:41:35,618
<i>Cuidado.</i> They're coming.

523
00:41:39,991 --> 00:41:41,394
You need to get up here.

524
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:42,695
- Go!
- Let's go!

525
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,199
You need to get your family!

526
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,727
Harper! Come on!

527
00:41:45,862 --> 00:41:47,432
Harper! Let's go.

528
00:41:47,568 --> 00:41:49,436
Let's go, let's go.

529
00:41:49,571 --> 00:41:51,233
- Come on!
- Come on.

530
00:41:54,002 --> 00:41:55,569
Come on.

531
00:41:55,705 --> 00:41:57,338
Come in.

532
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:06,619
10-13, we have

533
00:42:06,754 --> 00:42:08,985
three more incidences reported.

534
00:42:09,121 --> 00:42:10,718
Return to precinct.

535
00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:11,928
Copy that.

536
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,152
This is insane.

537
00:42:13,287 --> 00:42:15,290
People not hear the sirens?

538
00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:17,125
- A little busier than last year, huh?
- Yeah.

539
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,332
I shouldn't even be here.

540
00:42:19,468 --> 00:42:21,197
I did nothing wrong.

541
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,671
There's no such thing
as crime anymore.

542
00:42:27,409 --> 00:42:29,135
Let me fucking go!

543
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,945
Would you shut the fuck up?

544
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:31,981
Make me.

545
00:42:34,483 --> 00:42:35,985
What's going on, Darius?

546
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:38,017
I don't know.

547
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,252
Adela.

548
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,857
Call me back, please!

549
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:47,776
No luck?

550
00:42:48,491 --> 00:42:50,022
All right,
let me check the radio.

551
00:42:50,158 --> 00:42:51,257
Maybe there's some news.

552
00:42:51,392 --> 00:42:53,168
People are still purging

553
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:54,628
all across the country.

554
00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:56,871
"Ever After Purge" is popping
up all over social media,

555
00:42:57,006 --> 00:42:58,869
continuous purging dubbed
the "Forever Purge."

556
00:42:59,004 --> 00:43:00,165
Where the hell are we gonna go?

557
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:02,302
We'll find somewhere safe.

558
00:43:02,438 --> 00:43:03,636
First we help Juan
find his wife,

559
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:05,876
then we find somewhere safe.

560
00:43:06,012 --> 00:43:07,140
Stay inside your homes.

561
00:43:07,275 --> 00:43:09,041
Rosa?

562
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:09,882
What happened?

563
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:11,967
A police van?

564
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,052
Why the...

565
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:15,688
Take care of yourself, Rosa.

566
00:43:15,753 --> 00:43:16,890
<i>Gracias.</i>

567
00:43:17,026 --> 00:43:18,288
...they will take
action to stop it.

568
00:43:18,424 --> 00:43:20,956
- But still, no one knows...
- I know where she is.

569
00:43:21,092 --> 00:43:22,289
...who defined this movement.

570
00:43:26,196 --> 00:43:29,430
Ever After. Ever After.

571
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:32,866
This is the first...

572
00:43:33,002 --> 00:43:35,539
real... Purge.

573
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:40,040
It's never gonna stop.

574
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,153
Let me fucking go!

575
00:44:07,507 --> 00:44:09,771
Shit.

576
00:44:09,907 --> 00:44:11,747
It's blocked.

577
00:44:15,647 --> 00:44:17,245
Hold on.

578
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,386
The station is
just a few blocks away.

579
00:44:19,522 --> 00:44:21,823
I hope she'll be there.

580
00:44:22,855 --> 00:44:25,222
We can walk from here.

581
00:44:34,262 --> 00:44:35,296
You go get your wife.

582
00:44:35,432 --> 00:44:36,562
We'll stay here
and protect the truck.

583
00:44:36,698 --> 00:44:39,034
But you move fast.
It's not safe here.

584
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,472
You don't need to wait for us.

585
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:41,777
Yes, we do.

586
00:44:43,744 --> 00:44:45,407
I'm coming with you.

587
00:44:46,715 --> 00:44:48,307
You don't have to do that.

588
00:44:48,443 --> 00:44:51,714
No, you don't have to do that.

589
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:53,855
Yeah, I do.

590
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:56,726
They saved our lives.

591
00:44:58,892 --> 00:45:00,721
We'll be right here. Now go.

592
00:45:00,857 --> 00:45:02,699
Come on.

593
00:45:14,403 --> 00:45:16,244
I'll take the back.

594
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,180
Come on, guys.

595
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,145
This side.

596
00:45:25,281 --> 00:45:26,617
<i>Verga.</i>

597
00:45:35,762 --> 00:45:38,966
That is a .30-06.

598
00:45:42,635 --> 00:45:44,536
.30-30.

599
00:45:44,671 --> 00:45:46,308
Yeah, yeah.

600
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,708
AR-15.

601
00:45:49,843 --> 00:45:52,214
Listen to that rhythm.

602
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,349
That is a Glock.

603
00:45:58,449 --> 00:46:00,521
Listen to that bass.

604
00:46:00,656 --> 00:46:02,323
Double-barrel shotgun.

605
00:46:03,755 --> 00:46:05,795
AK-47.

606
00:46:10,595 --> 00:46:13,994
Homegrown music from
the heartland right there.

607
00:46:17,138 --> 00:46:19,869
That is American music,
motherfucker.

608
00:46:23,043 --> 00:46:24,810
Damn!

609
00:46:24,946 --> 00:46:26,678
Oh!

610
00:46:26,814 --> 00:46:29,648
Strike up the band!

611
00:46:29,784 --> 00:46:32,512
The symphony sings!

612
00:46:32,648 --> 00:46:34,056
Hold on! We're under attack!

613
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:37,057
Dispatch!

614
00:46:37,192 --> 00:46:38,822
We're outside the precinct!
Request backup!

615
00:46:38,957 --> 00:46:40,225
Boom, boom, boom!

616
00:47:13,693 --> 00:47:14,724
What?

617
00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:16,758
Okay.

618
00:47:16,894 --> 00:47:18,598
Honey...

619
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:20,593
I need you to take this.

620
00:47:20,729 --> 00:47:22,434
Don't ask any questions,
not right now.

621
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,101
I'm gonna get out the car.
I need you to lock the door.

622
00:47:24,236 --> 00:47:26,099
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

623
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

624
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,593
Open up, bitch.

625
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)

626
00:49:03,806 --> 00:49:05,708
Baby!

627
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:07,603
No!

628
00:49:26,522 --> 00:49:28,729
- Yeah!
- Cover me!

629
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:32,067
Go, go, go! Forever Purge!

630
00:49:36,404 --> 00:49:38,000
You're fucking dead, <i>puta!</i>

631
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:42,524
Fucking pig!

632
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,875
Get...

633
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,180
Get off me!

634
00:49:49,081 --> 00:49:50,079
You're a pig!

635
00:49:50,215 --> 00:49:52,681
Get the fuck off of me!

636
00:49:53,987 --> 00:49:55,751
Stop fighting it!

637
00:49:56,588 --> 00:49:59,120
Get the fuck off of me!

638
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:09,968
Fucking pig!

639
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:11,678
You're a pig!

640
00:50:11,939 --> 00:50:12,807
Motherfucker!

641
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,577
Help me!

642
00:50:16,712 --> 00:50:18,674
Fucking pig!

643
00:50:20,408 --> 00:50:21,875
Kill him!

644
00:50:41,697 --> 00:50:42,834
- Move.
- Forever Purge!

645
00:50:42,969 --> 00:50:44,436
Open it up!

646
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:46,399
- Get out of the way!
- Ever After!

647
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,427
Now these assholes
are really pissing me off.

648
00:50:52,941 --> 00:50:54,809
What was that?

649
00:50:57,785 --> 00:50:58,785
Juan?

650
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,412
- Adela.
- Juan!

651
00:51:00,547 --> 00:51:02,821
Juan! Juan.

652
00:51:08,426 --> 00:51:10,726
Purge forever!

653
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:17,165
- <i>De nada.</i>
- <i>¡Vamos!</i>

654
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,075
Over here!

655
00:51:26,674 --> 00:51:28,308
The truck is coming!

656
00:51:28,443 --> 00:51:29,514
It's Dylan!

657
00:51:29,649 --> 00:51:31,615
Truck! Get in the truck!

658
00:51:32,418 --> 00:51:34,517
- Get in!
- The truck! Come in!

659
00:51:34,653 --> 00:51:36,792
- Come on, boss.
- No! Find safety now!

660
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,360
I need to get to my family.

661
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,229
- <i>¡Adela!</i>
- We'll help you.

662
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:42,624
I'll move faster on my own.
I'll be fine. Just go.

663
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,924
- Go, go, go, go!
- Come on!

664
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:45,397
Adela, get on!

665
00:51:46,097 --> 00:51:46,965
Here.

666
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,133
You saved my life.

667
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:49,165
- Thank you, Darius.
- Okay.

668
00:51:49,301 --> 00:51:50,463
Adela!

669
00:52:55,029 --> 00:52:57,239
Okay, let's grab
everything we can.

670
00:53:00,868 --> 00:53:02,772
Peanut butter?

671
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,581
You found the jelly.

672
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:12,518
This could work.

673
00:53:36,942 --> 00:53:38,439
As the violence escalates

674
00:53:38,575 --> 00:53:39,776
across the country,

675
00:53:39,911 --> 00:53:42,149
we are still trying
to get more information.

676
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:43,349
That's right, Ruth.

677
00:53:43,485 --> 00:53:44,849
And we are still trying
to figure out

678
00:53:44,985 --> 00:53:48,519
if this Forever Purge was
coordinated or spontaneous.

679
00:53:48,655 --> 00:53:50,484
Various hashtags...
#TooMuchHate,

680
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:52,355
#OneDayNotEnough...

681
00:53:52,491 --> 00:53:53,857
are all over the Internet.

682
00:53:53,992 --> 00:53:56,793
Fringe conspiracy groups
supporting the Forever Purge

683
00:53:56,928 --> 00:53:59,799
are calling for
a new America to emerge from...

684
00:53:59,934 --> 00:54:01,567
Adela.

685
00:54:02,901 --> 00:54:05,604
I'm scared to have my baby
in this world.

686
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,105
Freedom to hate.
Freedom to purge.

687
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,639
Freedom to die.

688
00:54:09,775 --> 00:54:12,273
The NFFA has advised
that anyone

689
00:54:12,409 --> 00:54:15,146
displaying the Ever After flag
will be arrested immediately.

690
00:54:15,282 --> 00:54:17,878
We're in this together.

691
00:54:18,014 --> 00:54:19,617
Breaking news.

692
00:54:19,752 --> 00:54:21,818
We've just gotten word
that the NFFA

693
00:54:21,953 --> 00:54:23,986
has declared martial law
across the country.

694
00:54:24,121 --> 00:54:26,822
U.S. military will be sent
into nearly every city

695
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:29,021
to stop the violence
and restore peace.

696
00:54:29,157 --> 00:54:30,558
Citizens are being told
to relinq...

697
00:54:30,694 --> 00:54:31,927
<i>¿Bueno?</i>

698
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:34,901
<i>¡Bueno!</i>

699
00:54:43,537 --> 00:54:47,180
Wait. Juan, I can't understand
what you're saying.

700
00:54:47,316 --> 00:54:49,215
Come on. The-the cell things.

701
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:50,986
The-the...

702
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:53,179
- Towers?
- Yeah, the towers.

703
00:54:53,314 --> 00:54:55,051
The-the cell towers.
They are cutting them.

704
00:54:55,187 --> 00:54:58,551
Hey. We just watched that
a lot of cities have gone dark.

705
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:00,357
Miami's gone.

706
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:02,163
Austin is under siege.

707
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:03,328
First responders
are overwhelmed.

708
00:55:03,464 --> 00:55:04,328
We're in a state of emergency.

709
00:55:04,464 --> 00:55:05,895
It's all over the country.

710
00:55:06,031 --> 00:55:08,729
The violence is spreading
and not stopping.

711
00:55:08,865 --> 00:55:11,369
So there's nowhere safe to go.

712
00:55:11,504 --> 00:55:13,199
There's no way to get help.

713
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:20,178
There's that symbol again.

714
00:55:20,313 --> 00:55:21,746
This was planned.

715
00:55:25,746 --> 00:55:26,678
I got a map.

716
00:55:26,813 --> 00:55:28,119
I got ammo.

717
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,217
- What?
- Turn it up!

718
00:55:32,353 --> 00:55:34,227
Give it to me.

719
00:55:38,326 --> 00:55:40,400
All right.
Well, we need to make a move.

720
00:55:40,536 --> 00:55:42,734
They're gonna be
coming here for gas.

721
00:55:45,102 --> 00:55:48,077
- Hey. We got news, guys.
- What is it?

722
00:55:48,212 --> 00:55:50,071
I repeat, your safety...

723
00:55:50,207 --> 00:55:51,245
- Take this.
- ...cannot be guaranteed.

724
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:52,610
All right. Listen up.

725
00:55:52,746 --> 00:55:53,807
Due to the waves of violence

726
00:55:53,942 --> 00:55:55,614
currently sweeping the U.S.,

727
00:55:55,749 --> 00:55:57,913
Mexican President
León García Soler

728
00:55:58,049 --> 00:56:00,786
and Canadian Prime Minister
Sophie Poueche

729
00:56:00,921 --> 00:56:03,758
are opening their borders
for the next six hours.

730
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:07,995
Mexico and Canada will take in
anyone from America unarmed

731
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,563
and give them sanctuary

732
00:56:09,698 --> 00:56:12,600
until order is reestablished
in the U.S.

733
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:15,562
Both countries will then
close down their borders again

734
00:56:15,698 --> 00:56:16,929
in six hours.

735
00:56:17,064 --> 00:56:18,836
Once again, after six hours,

736
00:56:18,971 --> 00:56:21,274
both borders will be
closing indefinitely.

737
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:23,268
There are reports of violence

738
00:56:23,404 --> 00:56:24,836
from all corners
of the United States.

739
00:56:24,972 --> 00:56:26,307
We got to go to Mexico.

740
00:56:26,442 --> 00:56:28,076
Other countries
all over the world stand by

741
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:30,645
in amazement at
what's happening in the U.S.

742
00:56:30,781 --> 00:56:31,948
To recap, Canadian and...

743
00:56:32,184 --> 00:56:33,519
Let's go to Mexico.

744
00:56:37,455 --> 00:56:39,521
Let's go.

745
00:56:39,657 --> 00:56:41,661
We don't have a choice.

746
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:48,295
<i>Authorities are
urging everyone to get</i>

747
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:49,937
<i>to the closest border
as soon as possible.</i>

748
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:51,529
<i>With only three
and a half hours remaining,</i>

749
00:56:51,665 --> 00:56:53,266
<i>thousands of troops
have been gathered...</i>

750
00:56:53,401 --> 00:56:54,703
<i>Entries to Mexico and Canada</i>

751
00:56:54,838 --> 00:56:55,971
<i>are already overwhelmed.</i>

752
00:56:56,107 --> 00:56:57,310
<i>Listeners, do not delay,</i>

753
00:56:57,446 --> 00:56:59,007
<i>and get out while you can.</i>

754
00:56:59,143 --> 00:57:00,839
We will be ending
our broadcast here.

755
00:57:00,975 --> 00:57:02,213
Good luck, America.

756
00:57:02,348 --> 00:57:03,782
Stay safe.

757
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:36,518
You don't like me,
do you, Dylan?

758
00:57:38,012 --> 00:57:40,148
You don't like Mexicans.

759
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,585
What are you
talking about, Juan?

760
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:46,856
Come on, be honest.

761
00:57:46,992 --> 00:57:49,822
Let's, uh...
How do you say this?

762
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:52,032
Uh, slice the shit?

763
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,760
Cut the shit?

764
00:57:53,896 --> 00:57:54,894
Cut the shit. Yeah.

765
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:56,096
You want to cut the shit?

766
00:57:56,232 --> 00:57:57,737
I want to cut
the shit with you.

767
00:57:57,872 --> 00:58:00,209
All right, I'll cut the shit
with you, Juan.

768
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:02,610
I got no problem with Mexicans.

769
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:04,677
But I will say I don't
understand your culture

770
00:58:04,812 --> 00:58:07,483
just like you don't
understand mine.

771
00:58:09,016 --> 00:58:11,948
God's honest truth...
I don't think white people

772
00:58:12,084 --> 00:58:14,452
are any better or worse
than anybody else.

773
00:58:14,587 --> 00:58:16,888
But this I do believe.

774
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:21,361
We should all just
stick with our own.

775
00:58:21,496 --> 00:58:23,730
Just leave each other alone.

776
00:58:25,532 --> 00:58:28,069
You might be right.

777
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:30,198
But we are together now.

778
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,517
The hell is that?

779
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:43,815
Okay, everybody, wake up.

780
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:46,087
Wake up! Be alert!

781
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,416
Oh, shit.

782
00:58:50,551 --> 00:58:52,092
Jesus Christ.

783
00:58:52,227 --> 00:58:53,888
Ever After?

784
00:59:03,601 --> 00:59:05,772
Holy shit.

785
00:59:13,144 --> 00:59:15,144
Okay, they're coming up on us.

786
00:59:21,956 --> 00:59:24,116
Holy shit.
They're shooting at us.

787
00:59:29,092 --> 00:59:30,025
Shit. They're slowing us down.

788
00:59:30,161 --> 00:59:32,133
- Pull over!
- How many are there?

789
00:59:33,629 --> 00:59:35,169
- There are two on this side.
- You stay down.

790
00:59:35,304 --> 00:59:36,429
Just keep driving.

791
00:59:38,002 --> 00:59:40,906
Stop this truck! Now!

792
00:59:41,975 --> 00:59:43,475
Stay down. Everyone stay down.

793
00:59:43,611 --> 00:59:45,340
Stop this truck!

794
00:59:45,475 --> 00:59:47,207
- I'm just gonna run him over.
- No, baby.

795
00:59:47,343 --> 00:59:48,715
- No, baby, wait.
- Wait. Wait.

796
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:50,345
- Don't. I got an idea.
- What?

797
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,179
Don't do it.
There's too many of them.

798
00:59:52,315 --> 00:59:54,117
Juan, get away from the window.

799
00:59:55,285 --> 00:59:56,458
Stay away from the window.

800
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,688
Ever After, motherfuckers!

801
00:59:57,824 --> 00:59:59,217
Pull that fucking truck over!

802
01:00:03,191 --> 01:00:05,194
Ever After!

803
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:09,665
She's one of us!

804
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,937
Purge Ever After!

805
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:17,206
They're going away.

806
01:00:23,111 --> 01:00:24,185
<i>¿Estás bien?</i>

807
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,314
Way to go, Harper.

808
01:00:49,077 --> 01:00:50,870
The border will close

809
01:00:51,005 --> 01:00:53,372
in three hours.

810
01:01:11,365 --> 01:01:15,061
Attention.
This area is under martial law.

811
01:01:15,197 --> 01:01:17,062
Weapons are not permitted.

812
01:01:17,197 --> 01:01:18,872
This is the NFFA.

813
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:23,210
Lay down your weapons,
or you will be shot.

814
01:01:23,345 --> 01:01:25,445
Clear the area.

815
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,480
I repeat, clear the area.

816
01:01:27,616 --> 01:01:29,111
Surrender your weapons...

817
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:32,045
The hell is that?

818
01:01:32,181 --> 01:01:34,586
Oh, my God.

819
01:01:34,722 --> 01:01:36,725
Holy shit.

820
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,551
The crossing point
is only one mile away.

821
01:01:38,686 --> 01:01:40,090
There's no way through.

822
01:01:40,226 --> 01:01:41,697
It's blocked.
What should I do?

823
01:01:43,196 --> 01:01:44,826
How are we
supposed to get through?

824
01:01:44,962 --> 01:01:47,131
We find a way, Cassidy.

825
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,232
Just keep driving.

826
01:01:53,368 --> 01:01:54,935
We got less than three hours.

827
01:01:56,472 --> 01:01:57,975
Oh, please don't break down.

828
01:01:58,110 --> 01:01:59,676
Come on, baby.
We're nearly there.

829
01:01:59,811 --> 01:02:01,816
Baby, be careful.

830
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,483
- It's blocked.
- What?

831
01:02:07,618 --> 01:02:09,790
She's broke down.
Come on, we got to get out.

832
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,419
The border's just
a few blocks from here.

833
01:02:11,554 --> 01:02:13,254
We can make it.
Everybody, you follow Juan.

834
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:14,826
Get ready. Stay low.
Stay together.

835
01:02:14,961 --> 01:02:17,089
I cover you in three, two, one.

836
01:02:17,224 --> 01:02:18,326
Come on! Come on!

837
01:02:18,462 --> 01:02:19,599
This is the NFFA.

838
01:02:19,735 --> 01:02:20,835
Go! Let's go, let's go!

839
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,094
Lay down your weapons,

840
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:23,670
or you will be shot.

841
01:02:23,805 --> 01:02:25,134
Purge this country!

842
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:26,264
Clear the area.

843
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,374
I repeat, clear the area.

844
01:02:27,509 --> 01:02:28,970
Stay close, guys.

845
01:02:29,105 --> 01:02:31,335
Dylan, cover the back.

846
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:33,338
Stay close.

847
01:02:40,586 --> 01:02:42,649
- <i>Mano derecha.</i>
- T.T., cover the right.

848
01:02:42,784 --> 01:02:44,559
<i>Cuida tu derecha.
Cuida tu derecha.</i>

849
01:02:47,491 --> 01:02:49,490
Juan! Go, go!

850
01:02:50,596 --> 01:02:51,998
Clear!

851
01:02:53,361 --> 01:02:55,203
Move, move!

852
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,404
I'm behind you.

853
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:01,332
Stay close.

854
01:03:01,468 --> 01:03:03,438
Revolution!

855
01:03:09,213 --> 01:03:10,718
Get to the wall.
Get to the wall.

856
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:12,144
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

857
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,020
There's the wall, guys.

858
01:03:15,552 --> 01:03:18,288
Those are innocents.
Let 'em through.

859
01:03:20,392 --> 01:03:21,891
Kill them brownies!

860
01:03:22,027 --> 01:03:23,356
Dylan, get back.

861
01:03:23,491 --> 01:03:24,765
They have a .50 caliber.

862
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,932
Stay with me. Stay with me.

863
01:03:27,067 --> 01:03:28,827
Oh, shit!

864
01:03:28,962 --> 01:03:31,004
- Let's use it as cover.
- Surrender your weapons...

865
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:32,398
- Let's go!
- You guys go to the wall!

866
01:03:32,534 --> 01:03:33,540
Get cover! Get cover!

867
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:34,733
Move, move!

868
01:03:34,868 --> 01:03:36,674
This is the NFFA...

869
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:38,671
To the diner! The diner!

870
01:03:38,806 --> 01:03:40,682
Go, guys!
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

871
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:42,879
Clear the area.

872
01:03:43,014 --> 01:03:45,115
Stay close.

873
01:03:45,251 --> 01:03:47,581
Come on!
We're gonna go across!

874
01:03:52,224 --> 01:03:54,187
Come on, guys!
Let's go! Let's go!

875
01:03:58,761 --> 01:04:01,398
Put your heads down
when you come in.

876
01:04:01,534 --> 01:04:03,563
- We can go. Stay back.
- Keep your head down.

877
01:04:03,699 --> 01:04:06,467
- Keep your body down. Go.
- Yeah, yeah.

878
01:04:06,602 --> 01:04:09,609
We need to keep up.
Follow me, okay?

879
01:04:11,572 --> 01:04:13,309
Stay down. Stay down.

880
01:04:17,548 --> 01:04:19,820
- What is that?
- It's a tank.

881
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:22,614
We're gonna go across
to the theater!

882
01:04:22,749 --> 01:04:24,421
- Across to the theater.
- Okay.

883
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:26,792
When the truck passes,
let's make a run.

884
01:04:30,029 --> 01:04:31,724
We have to cross right now!

885
01:04:31,859 --> 01:04:34,061
There's a fucking tank
down there.

886
01:04:34,196 --> 01:04:36,201
Come on! Come on!

887
01:04:37,971 --> 01:04:39,875
Oh, my gosh!

888
01:04:42,569 --> 01:04:44,477
Come on. Get in.

889
01:04:44,612 --> 01:04:46,440
Get in. Get in.

890
01:04:46,576 --> 01:04:48,476
- Come on!
- Tank is on move!

891
01:04:48,612 --> 01:04:50,318
This is the NFFA.

892
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,798
Hey.

893
01:05:11,971 --> 01:05:14,335
Adela.

894
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:16,040
No, no, no. Come on!

895
01:05:16,176 --> 01:05:17,304
- Adela.
- Juan?

896
01:05:17,439 --> 01:05:19,209
- Are you okay?
- Juan.

897
01:05:19,344 --> 01:05:20,976
- It's blocked.
- Are you guys okay?

898
01:05:21,112 --> 01:05:22,781
Adela, we'll go around.

899
01:05:22,916 --> 01:05:24,852
Find another way out.

900
01:05:24,988 --> 01:05:27,045
- Baby?
- I can't get it open!

901
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:29,180
- Baby, open the door.
- I can't get it open!

902
01:05:29,315 --> 01:05:30,618
Baby?

903
01:05:33,524 --> 01:05:35,128
The border will close

904
01:05:35,263 --> 01:05:37,865
- in two hours and 30 minutes.
- Come on.

905
01:05:42,537 --> 01:05:46,165
Attention.
This area is under martial law.

906
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:52,371
We people of the mountains

907
01:05:52,507 --> 01:05:54,706
believe, at the castle...

908
01:05:54,841 --> 01:05:56,979
He wants me to ask
if you can wait

909
01:05:57,115 --> 01:05:59,551
and go on after sunrise.

910
01:05:59,687 --> 01:06:01,655
Well, I'm sorry, but
there's a carriage meeting me

911
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,187
at Borgo Pass at midnight.

912
01:06:03,323 --> 01:06:05,352
- Borgo Pass?
- Yes.

913
01:06:05,488 --> 01:06:07,156
Whose carriage?

914
01:06:07,292 --> 01:06:08,755
Count Dracula's.

915
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:12,524
- Count Dracula's?
- Yes.

916
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Castle Dracula?
Yes, that's where I'm going.
- To the castle?
- Yes.
Fuck.

917
01:06:24,372 --> 01:06:25,841
A fucking bat.

918
01:06:25,976 --> 01:06:27,676
Fuck.

919
01:06:27,811 --> 01:06:30,552
...at the castle,
there are vampires.

920
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:32,721
Dracula and his wives.

921
01:06:32,856 --> 01:06:36,016
They take the form of wolves...

922
01:06:36,151 --> 01:06:40,419
Attention.
This area is under martial law.

923
01:06:40,555 --> 01:06:42,421
Weapons are not permitted.

924
01:06:42,557 --> 01:06:43,895
Oh, shit.

925
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:45,423
There's another tank.

926
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:47,068
We can't go around.

927
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:51,402
- Wait. Wait here.
- Okay.

928
01:06:55,336 --> 01:06:57,243
All clear.

929
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Let's get out of here.

930
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,899
- All good?
- Behind you!

931
01:07:34,913 --> 01:07:36,975
T.T.

932
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:38,183
Look.

933
01:07:40,602 --> 01:07:42,354
It's the roses.

934
01:07:43,418 --> 01:07:44,792
<i>There.</i>

935
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:47,018
Stay next to the wall, okay?

936
01:07:47,153 --> 01:07:49,457
Return to your homes.

937
01:07:49,592 --> 01:07:51,862
I repeat, return to your homes.

938
01:07:51,997 --> 01:07:53,992
Stay next to me.

939
01:07:57,964 --> 01:07:59,971
I need to get to my wife.

940
01:08:00,107 --> 01:08:02,110
What are you looking for?

941
01:08:03,472 --> 01:08:05,178
We Mexicans leave signs

942
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:07,142
all over our city
to help each other.

943
01:08:07,278 --> 01:08:09,340
Adela is following them.

944
01:08:09,475 --> 01:08:12,981
If we want to find our wives,
we should do the same thing.

945
01:08:13,116 --> 01:08:15,017
Go on.

946
01:08:21,328 --> 01:08:22,955
Fuck.

947
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:24,965
Return to your homes.

948
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,531
- Hold this.
- Okay. Okay.

949
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:29,032
I repeat, return to your homes.

950
01:08:29,167 --> 01:08:30,495
Adela.

951
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:31,831
Yes?

952
01:08:31,967 --> 01:08:33,875
How come you know
how to fight like that?

953
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,070
I was part of the autodefensas.

954
01:08:36,205 --> 01:08:37,639
What?

955
01:08:37,775 --> 01:08:39,714
A group of women
fighting the cartels.

956
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:42,049
We did damage to them.

957
01:08:42,185 --> 01:08:44,876
They forced me and Juan
off our land.

958
01:08:45,011 --> 01:08:48,189
This is how we got here
to the States.

959
01:08:49,218 --> 01:08:50,719
Here.

960
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:52,853
For you.

961
01:08:53,893 --> 01:08:55,929
Okay.

962
01:08:57,561 --> 01:08:59,066
Army's passed. Come on.

963
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:00,502
- Okay.
- Stay with me.

964
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:01,763
Let's go.

965
01:09:01,898 --> 01:09:03,395
The border
will close in two hours

966
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:05,369
and 15 minutes.

967
01:09:10,203 --> 01:09:12,537
Drop it! Move or I kill you.

968
01:09:12,673 --> 01:09:14,572
Hand 'em over. Down.

969
01:09:14,707 --> 01:09:16,015
Drop your weapons.

970
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:18,047
There's nothing you can do.

971
01:09:18,182 --> 01:09:20,214
Drop 'em.

972
01:09:20,349 --> 01:09:21,545
You, too, amigo.

973
01:09:21,681 --> 01:09:22,683
Come on, now.

974
01:09:22,819 --> 01:09:25,259
You're surrounded.
You will be shot.

975
01:09:28,822 --> 01:09:30,925
That a boy.

976
01:09:31,995 --> 01:09:34,430
It's all right, pretty thing.
Come on, now.

977
01:09:34,565 --> 01:09:36,369
Do it.

978
01:09:37,403 --> 01:09:39,602
Nice and easy. Good.

979
01:09:39,737 --> 01:09:41,600
You fucking deaf, son?

980
01:09:43,603 --> 01:09:45,246
Good boy.

981
01:09:46,577 --> 01:09:48,816
Look what we got here.

982
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:51,315
Couple of bad hombres.

983
01:09:51,451 --> 01:09:52,650
Well, I'll be.

984
01:09:52,785 --> 01:09:54,388
- There's two of us and two of them.
- Mm.

985
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:55,949
That right there is
what's wrong with this country.

986
01:09:56,084 --> 01:09:57,489
What do you want to do
about 'em, Daddy?

987
01:09:57,625 --> 01:09:59,951
Why don't we give
our fellow Americans here

988
01:10:00,087 --> 01:10:02,427
an opportunity
to redeem themselves?

989
01:10:02,563 --> 01:10:04,163
Yeah, I like the sound of that.

990
01:10:04,298 --> 01:10:05,932
Mm, let me explain.

991
01:10:06,067 --> 01:10:09,134
You kill the brownies,

992
01:10:09,269 --> 01:10:11,800
and the two of you can live,

993
01:10:11,935 --> 01:10:16,134
stay here in this great,
God-loving country.

994
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:19,137
Help us purify this nation
once and for all.

995
01:10:19,272 --> 01:10:22,712
That's what the
Ever After Purge is all about.

996
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,979
Fuck you, redneck.

997
01:10:27,418 --> 01:10:28,921
Yeah, fuck you, pig.

998
01:10:29,057 --> 01:10:30,591
No, fuck you, bitch!

999
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,917
This country's gone haywire.
It don't know itself no more.

1000
01:10:33,053 --> 01:10:34,789
You don't fucking
know yourself.

1001
01:10:34,925 --> 01:10:36,428
Mother, Mother,
Mother, it's okay.

1002
01:10:36,564 --> 01:10:37,930
Look in the fucking mirror!

1003
01:10:38,066 --> 01:10:39,630
Mother! Hey, it's okay.

1004
01:10:41,169 --> 01:10:43,161
Maybe this will help y'all.

1005
01:10:46,902 --> 01:10:48,201
You happy now?

1006
01:10:48,337 --> 01:10:49,970
Mother.

1007
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:52,247
Gladly.

1008
01:11:01,654 --> 01:11:04,259
T.T., no!

1009
01:11:08,021 --> 01:11:10,660
Trinidad. <i>¿Estás bien?</i>

1010
01:11:10,796 --> 01:11:12,531
Let the purification begin.

1011
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:14,225
You whore.

1012
01:11:14,361 --> 01:11:17,235
Fucking dying?
Oh, you fucking little beaner.

1013
01:11:17,371 --> 01:11:19,664
You fucking ain't worth shit.

1014
01:11:19,799 --> 01:11:21,837
Get the fuck back.

1015
01:11:24,841 --> 01:11:26,446
Don't even think about it,
brownie.

1016
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,746
This is the NFFA!

1017
01:11:29,881 --> 01:11:31,809
Lay down your weapons,
or you will be shot.

1018
01:11:31,945 --> 01:11:33,816
Shoot the pigs!

1019
01:11:35,222 --> 01:11:37,017
Mother! Call for backup!

1020
01:11:38,354 --> 01:11:40,053
Shit.

1021
01:11:40,188 --> 01:11:43,221
Backup! Backup!
We need backup, goddamn it!

1022
01:11:44,792 --> 01:11:46,829
Backup's coming, baby.

1023
01:11:50,402 --> 01:11:52,164
Fuck!

1024
01:12:04,854 --> 01:12:06,351
Mother, no! No!

1025
01:12:06,486 --> 01:12:08,052
- Mother!
- Harper, let's go!

1026
01:12:08,187 --> 01:12:09,918
Mother!

1027
01:12:16,356 --> 01:12:18,898
- Take cover!
- RPG!

1028
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:26,235
Mother!

1029
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:27,236
Mother, no.

1030
01:12:27,371 --> 01:12:28,937
No, no, Mother.

1031
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:44,387
This is Alpha Leader.

1032
01:12:44,523 --> 01:12:46,724
Request recon, all units.

1033
01:12:49,957 --> 01:12:51,564
It's here.

1034
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,732
If our men are alive,
they will be here.

1035
01:13:05,774 --> 01:13:07,613
Help me with the door.

1036
01:13:13,949 --> 01:13:16,050
Are you sure that this is safe?

1037
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:19,900
The rose.

1038
01:13:21,235 --> 01:13:21,902
It's here.

1039
01:13:28,663 --> 01:13:30,161
Stay over there.

1040
01:13:30,297 --> 01:13:31,863
Are you sure that they're here?

1041
01:13:31,999 --> 01:13:33,837
They have to be.

1042
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Drop the weapons!

1043
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:44,049
Who the fuck are you?

1044
01:13:44,466 --> 01:13:45,801
We followed the signs.

1045
01:13:48,345 --> 01:13:49,221
And the white girl?

1046
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:51,139
She's with me.

1047
01:13:51,849 --> 01:13:53,517
She's pregnant. Don't scare her.

1048
01:13:55,658 --> 01:13:57,498
<i>Está bien.</i>

1049
01:13:58,981 --> 01:13:59,439
Follow me.

1050
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:09,741
You're the last ones.

1051
01:14:12,982 --> 01:14:14,713
Sit down.

1052
01:14:16,352 --> 01:14:18,050
I don't see them.

1053
01:14:18,185 --> 01:14:20,312
Where are they?

1054
01:14:20,447 --> 01:14:24,050
The border
will close in two hours.

1055
01:14:37,832 --> 01:14:39,701
Adela. Adela.

1056
01:14:39,836 --> 01:14:41,839
Ay.

1057
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:56,550
Cassie. Oh, my God.

1058
01:14:56,685 --> 01:14:57,888
You okay?

1059
01:14:59,555 --> 01:15:01,386
T.T.?

1060
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:04,087
What happened?

1061
01:15:08,331 --> 01:15:10,131
We have breaking news now.

1062
01:15:10,266 --> 01:15:12,100
This is just coming in.
We have been notified

1063
01:15:12,235 --> 01:15:14,241
that there has been
an attack in El Paso

1064
01:15:14,377 --> 01:15:15,904
at a U.S. Army military base.

1065
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,905
As a result,
the NFFA is pulling all

1066
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,305
military troops out of El Paso.

1067
01:15:19,441 --> 01:15:22,216
Again, the military is
retreating out of El Paso

1068
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:24,912
after suffering massive losses

1069
01:15:25,048 --> 01:15:26,477
in their battle
against purgers,

1070
01:15:26,612 --> 01:15:29,656
including an attack
on a U.S. Army base.

1071
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,956
And now
I'm hearing that in response

1072
01:15:32,091 --> 01:15:34,728
to the Army's withdrawal,
Mexico will now be closing

1073
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,258
their El Paso border
crossing point immediately.

1074
01:15:37,393 --> 01:15:39,997
Again, the El Paso border point
will no longer be open

1075
01:15:40,132 --> 01:15:42,737
to United States citizens
fleeing the Forever Purge.

1076
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:45,936
Americans left behind
at the now closed border wall

1077
01:15:46,071 --> 01:15:48,268
are being slaughtered
by purgers. It is a war.

1078
01:15:48,403 --> 01:15:51,074
El Paso has fallen
to Ever After purgers

1079
01:15:51,209 --> 01:15:53,338
who are going door-to-door
hunting down anyone

1080
01:15:53,474 --> 01:15:55,109
who is not a part
of their hate group.

1081
01:15:55,244 --> 01:15:57,616
The border is now closed.

1082
01:16:02,492 --> 01:16:03,591
At this point, already,

1083
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:05,316
you can feel there's
a change in the air...

1084
01:16:05,452 --> 01:16:08,161
This city's gonna get
even worse.

1085
01:16:08,296 --> 01:16:10,125
<i>Ven.</i> Come.

1086
01:16:11,596 --> 01:16:13,264
Get out the back.

1087
01:16:13,399 --> 01:16:14,798
Find Chiago.

1088
01:16:14,933 --> 01:16:16,967
Move fast.
Tell him to meet us

1089
01:16:17,102 --> 01:16:19,935
in the corner of, uh,
Amboy and Highland.

1090
01:16:20,071 --> 01:16:21,676
Tell him,
if he doesn't do this,

1091
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:25,008
many good people will die,
including me. Okay?

1092
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:26,461
Yes, boss.

1093
01:16:29,011 --> 01:16:30,881
Okay, let's go! Follow me.

1094
01:16:31,017 --> 01:16:32,620
- I know a way to safety.
- Come on! Come on!

1095
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:34,313
I need you to stand up
and walk with us, okay?

1096
01:16:34,449 --> 01:16:35,955
- Okay. I can do it.
- Can you do that?

1097
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:37,721
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Come on, baby. Come on. - Okay.

1098
01:16:37,856 --> 01:16:38,822
<i>¡Vámonos, cabrónes!! Por allá!</i>

1099
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:39,994
- <i>Órale.</i>
- <i>Vamos.</i>

1100
01:16:42,755 --> 01:16:44,998
The purification will not stop.

1101
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:49,363
This city is now occupied by
the real patriots of America.

1102
01:16:49,499 --> 01:16:53,706
Our duty is to uphold
American beliefs and values

1103
01:16:53,841 --> 01:16:55,402
while keeping America
pure and free

1104
01:16:55,537 --> 01:16:58,404
from refugees and terrorists.

1105
01:16:58,539 --> 01:17:00,544
We have taken back
what is lawfully ours,

1106
01:17:00,679 --> 01:17:01,913
and we will now embark

1107
01:17:02,049 --> 01:17:05,082
on purification of our nation,
city by city.

1108
01:17:05,217 --> 01:17:09,053
Only full-blooded Americans
are welcome here.

1109
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:11,151
All invaders will be purged.

1110
01:17:11,287 --> 01:17:15,253
We control El Paso
and all of Texas.

1111
01:17:15,388 --> 01:17:17,932
The purification will not stop.

1112
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:21,160
This city is now occupied by
the real patriots of America.

1113
01:17:21,295 --> 01:17:22,899
You're clear.

1114
01:17:23,035 --> 01:17:25,167
Just keep your voices down.

1115
01:17:27,972 --> 01:17:29,566
Listen. Don't worry.

1116
01:17:29,702 --> 01:17:32,178
- Try to stay calm.
- Head down.

1117
01:17:32,313 --> 01:17:34,044
Who's that?

1118
01:17:35,342 --> 01:17:37,212
It's okay. It's okay.

1119
01:17:42,919 --> 01:17:44,281
Is it here?

1120
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:45,752
Guys?

1121
01:17:45,887 --> 01:17:47,395
It's them.

1122
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:49,391
- Hey.
- It's them!

1123
01:17:52,063 --> 01:17:54,735
Chiago, take us
to Mexico, please.

1124
01:17:57,497 --> 01:17:59,272
Get 'em on board.
We're leaving.

1125
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:00,632
<i>Gracias, Chiago.</i>

1126
01:18:00,768 --> 01:18:02,543
Okay. Come on, come on, come on.

1127
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,909
- Come on.
- Come on, this way.

1128
01:18:05,044 --> 01:18:06,479
- They're here.
- Go, get in the truck.

1129
01:18:06,614 --> 01:18:08,606
Come on, let's go, let's go.

1130
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:25,227
Alpha Leader, come in.

1131
01:18:26,227 --> 01:18:28,230
Alpha Leader, do you copy?

1132
01:18:30,738 --> 01:18:32,599
- We've found 'em.
- Where?

1133
01:18:32,735 --> 01:18:35,299
They're headed for the border
through the reservation.

1134
01:18:35,434 --> 01:18:37,001
Follow 'em. Don't lose 'em.

1135
01:18:37,137 --> 01:18:38,471
I'll catch up.

1136
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,944
How are you getting us across?

1137
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,012
My tribe has lived
right on the border

1138
01:19:15,147 --> 01:19:17,675
of the U.S. and Mexico
for centuries.

1139
01:19:17,811 --> 01:19:21,013
We were the only people
who could legally cross.

1140
01:19:21,149 --> 01:19:22,790
Then the wall split us.

1141
01:19:24,917 --> 01:19:27,855
But there are parts of
the terrain <i>los pendejos</i>

1142
01:19:27,991 --> 01:19:29,493
can't build the wall on.

1143
01:19:29,629 --> 01:19:31,663
Too dangerous.

1144
01:19:31,799 --> 01:19:34,400
And we use it to make passage.

1145
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:36,835
We'll take you through.

1146
01:19:36,971 --> 01:19:39,664
Some of you deserve
another chance.

1147
01:19:53,785 --> 01:19:55,185
Are you in labor?

1148
01:19:56,624 --> 01:19:57,891
Mm.

1149
01:19:58,027 --> 01:19:59,350
Cassie, we got
to get you to Mexico.

1150
01:19:59,486 --> 01:20:01,228
I know it's bad timing, baby.

1151
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:02,730
You'll be okay.

1152
01:20:02,865 --> 01:20:04,256
There'll be help
when we get across.

1153
01:20:04,392 --> 01:20:06,233
Camps have been set up, okay?

1154
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:08,000
Thank you.

1155
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,405
Dylan.

1156
01:20:19,006 --> 01:20:20,045
Look.

1157
01:20:27,718 --> 01:20:28,848
Damn it.

1158
01:20:28,983 --> 01:20:29,915
Juan?

1159
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:32,189
Yeah?

1160
01:20:32,324 --> 01:20:34,224
Looks like
we got trouble coming.

1161
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:35,669
Motherfucker.

1162
01:21:04,121 --> 01:21:05,288
They're here.

1163
01:21:12,595 --> 01:21:13,859
- Let's go. Come on, people.
- Go, go, go!

1164
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:15,900
This is the crossing point!
We're on foot from here!

1165
01:21:16,036 --> 01:21:17,068
Let's go!

1166
01:21:17,204 --> 01:21:18,472
- Let's move! Fast!
- Come on, let's go!

1167
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:19,736
Follow me!

1168
01:21:19,871 --> 01:21:21,071
I will guide you!

1169
01:21:21,207 --> 01:21:22,569
<i>Vámonos.</i>

1170
01:21:30,751 --> 01:21:32,116
They're getting close.

1171
01:21:32,252 --> 01:21:33,520
- Follow me.
- We need to move.

1172
01:21:33,656 --> 01:21:35,122
- Hey, honey?
- Yeah?

1173
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:36,947
You go let these people get you
across the border, okay?

1174
01:21:37,082 --> 01:21:39,288
- Baby, where are you going?
- Yeah, you go ahead.

1175
01:21:39,424 --> 01:21:40,684
I love you.
I'll be right behind you.

1176
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:41,929
- Baby, you have to go with me.
- Go on.

1177
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:43,493
- Don't leave me.
- Go. I have to stop them.

1178
01:21:43,629 --> 01:21:44,765
- No, baby. You cannot leave me.
- You just focus on the baby.

1179
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:46,457
- Okay?
- Cassie, I'll protect you.

1180
01:21:46,593 --> 01:21:47,534
- Thank you, sister.
- Yeah.

1181
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:48,968
You got her?

1182
01:21:49,103 --> 01:21:50,969
We'll see you over there,
all right?

1183
01:21:51,105 --> 01:21:52,630
Get her to the medics
in Mexico.

1184
01:21:52,765 --> 01:21:55,305
Get 'em
across the border safely!

1185
01:21:57,573 --> 01:21:59,504
<i>Rápido.</i>

1186
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:01,539
That's it. On here.

1187
01:22:01,674 --> 01:22:03,210
Sit on it.

1188
01:22:03,346 --> 01:22:05,447
Put your knees underneath it.

1189
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:12,323
Yeah, I'm low on ammo.

1190
01:22:12,458 --> 01:22:14,789
- You guys got ammo?
- We have a few guns,

1191
01:22:14,924 --> 01:22:18,731
but when the bullets run dry,
draw them in close, use blades.

1192
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:20,594
Give me a magazine.

1193
01:22:22,301 --> 01:22:23,370
It's the last round of ammo.

1194
01:22:23,506 --> 01:22:25,170
Make it count.

1195
01:22:25,305 --> 01:22:27,370
- We'll help you.
- But it's not your fight.

1196
01:22:27,506 --> 01:22:30,439
We've been fighting this fight
for 500 years.

1197
01:22:31,845 --> 01:22:33,644
Take what you need.

1198
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:50,492
This is our last stand.

1199
01:22:53,293 --> 01:22:55,535
On my ready!

1200
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:57,664
Let 'em get close!

1201
01:23:04,008 --> 01:23:06,013
Wait for 'em!

1202
01:23:09,045 --> 01:23:10,946
Wait for it!

1203
01:23:35,372 --> 01:23:37,471
Are you okay?

1204
01:23:39,113 --> 01:23:40,905
- Help her.
- Take my hand.

1205
01:23:44,046 --> 01:23:45,745
Now!

1206
01:23:54,255 --> 01:23:55,590
Go. Go, go, go.

1207
01:24:01,367 --> 01:24:02,564
<i>¡A chingar a su madre,
cabrones!</i>

1208
01:24:05,970 --> 01:24:07,233
Take cover! Now!

1209
01:24:10,407 --> 01:24:12,079
I'm out!

1210
01:24:16,149 --> 01:24:18,217
- Go!
- Come on.

1211
01:24:20,984 --> 01:24:22,221
Damn it.

1212
01:24:26,627 --> 01:24:27,654
I'm out!

1213
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:29,354
- Yeah, I'm out, too.
- I have one left.

1214
01:24:38,103 --> 01:24:39,436
Come on, motherfucker!

1215
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,019
Fuck.

1216
01:25:07,365 --> 01:25:09,367
Hunt 'em down and kill 'em all.

1217
01:25:10,701 --> 01:25:14,131
Save that Mexican
son of a bitch for me.

1218
01:25:14,267 --> 01:25:16,633
Purge and purify, Ever After!

1219
01:25:16,769 --> 01:25:18,644
Ever After!

1220
01:25:46,202 --> 01:25:47,771
They're coming.

1221
01:25:47,906 --> 01:25:50,171
Good.

1222
01:25:50,306 --> 01:25:52,279
We slow them down.

1223
01:25:52,414 --> 01:25:54,511
Give our people more time
to get across safely.

1224
01:25:59,982 --> 01:26:02,684
You guys stay in here.
We'll cover the back room.

1225
01:26:26,979 --> 01:26:27,604
I love you.

1226
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:29,815
I love you.

1227
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1228
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:35,976
We got this handled here.

1229
01:27:36,111 --> 01:27:38,810
Rest of you go stop 'em
from crossing the border.

1230
01:27:38,945 --> 01:27:39,950
- On it.
- Got it.

1231
01:27:40,085 --> 01:27:40,951
Let's go.

1232
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,860
We're gaining on 'em.
They can't be far.

1233
01:28:10,147 --> 01:28:11,142
Adela!

1234
01:28:26,563 --> 01:28:27,796
Adela. Adela.

1235
01:28:28,058 --> 01:28:28,976
Adela, wake up.

1236
01:28:29,468 --> 01:28:30,865
There he is. Grab him!

1237
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:28,487
Adela!

1238
01:29:29,888 --> 01:29:31,765
Fucking whore!

1239
01:30:23,509 --> 01:30:25,544
Call your people
and tell 'em you need help.

1240
01:30:43,467 --> 01:30:45,300
Call out now!

1241
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,268
- Kill this fucking pig!
- Fucking English!

1242
01:30:50,492 --> 01:30:51,451
Kill this pig!

1243
01:30:58,147 --> 01:31:00,051
Translate!
What are you saying?!

1244
01:31:01,882 --> 01:31:04,216
I said speak English!

1245
01:31:04,351 --> 01:31:06,587
Translate!

1246
01:31:06,722 --> 01:31:08,776
- Kill him!
- Speak fucking English!

1247
01:31:08,844 --> 01:31:09,678
Kill him!

1248
01:31:09,954 --> 01:31:10,930
I'll do it!

1249
01:31:11,066 --> 01:31:12,031
Speak English!

1250
01:31:12,167 --> 01:31:13,656
I will cut your throat!

1251
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:15,469
Speak...

1252
01:31:26,171 --> 01:31:27,111
I got him.

1253
01:31:31,681 --> 01:31:33,711
Does this translate?

1254
01:31:33,846 --> 01:31:35,181
<i>Pendejo.</i>

1255
01:31:58,352 --> 01:31:59,311
Are you okay, my love?

1256
01:32:29,803 --> 01:32:31,311
You made it.

1257
01:32:31,446 --> 01:32:33,976
You just crossed into <i>México.</i>

1258
01:32:38,614 --> 01:32:40,081
She'll be there.

1259
01:32:54,734 --> 01:32:55,998
- <i>Gracias.</i>
