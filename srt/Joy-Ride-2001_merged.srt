Berkeley's like summer all year.

00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,643

So, what's, um You know,

00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:12,123
Sexy choice. Yeah.

00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:14,527
Sorry. I didn't tell you before.

28
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:16,829

29
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:19,531
You what--
I don't understand.

30
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:22,040
We broke up.

31
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:26,013
he's been acting serious and weird.

32
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:28,677
Serious and weird, how?
he was getting all serious and weird?

33
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:33,884
I mean I, I told you
what he was like, and--

34
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,258
Wait, holdon.
Lewis, it's 3.;00 in the morning.

35
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:38,263
I got a final tomorrow.
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:40,994
I'll be quieter.

37
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:46,050
Now they know what it feels like...

38
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:47,710
Lewis?

39
00:02:49,147 --> 00:02:53,084
I'm sorry. So, what happened?

40
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:57,113
he kept...
looking at me, as if, you know...

41
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,422
he totally thought
that he knew me...

42
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:02,590
which he so obviously didn't.

43
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:04,725
And he started crying.

44
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:07,203
Which sort of sealed
the deal, you know?

45
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:10,765
You made him cry?
I broke up with him.

46
00:03:10,843 --> 00:03:12,778
Wouldn't you cry?

47
00:03:12,846 --> 00:03:16,010
Listen, Venna,
you're cute, but you're not that cute.

48
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:18,019
I was kidding.

49
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:21,422
Well, I'm not
in the mood to go home.

50
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:24,958
Wish I had a car,
then I could...

51
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,965
just get there gradually.

52
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:29,969
Decompress a little bit, you know?

53
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:34,840
Ifyou had a car, you could
stop by Colorado and pick me up.

54
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:39,009
We could have an adventure.
The two of us and a windshield.

55
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,985
I have a car.
No, you don't.

56
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:44,353
Yeah. Didn't I tell you?

57
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,985
No!
Yeah, well, like, I got one.

58
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,492


59
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:58,320

00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:01,464

61
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,182
Vintage 1971 Chrysler Newport.

62
00:04:07,473 --> 00:04:10,806
And if there's anyway you could
bring some pink champagne...

63
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:25,676
I've changed my plans.
I'm no longer fyting back.

64
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,876
-I bought a car, so I'm driving.
By yourself?.

65
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:31,479
No. Actually, I was thinkin'
about picking up Venna.

66
00:04:30,597 --> 00:04:33,498
So, what was that about?
-Just wait.

67
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:35,954
Mom?

68
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:38,294
Sorry. It's--Sorry.

69
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,460
That's great, Lewis.

70
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:44,165
What's the matter?
Your brother just called.

71
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,870
he was arrested again.
Drunk and disorderly.

72
00:04:46,945 --> 00:04:51,508
Where, in San Diego?
Salt Lake City.

73
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:56,114
Don't worry. It's not your problem.

74
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,389
What did Dad say?
You know your dad.

75
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:01,396
he didn't even want
to talk to Fuller.

76
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:04,229
Said if he hadn't grown up yet,
it was never going to happen.

77
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:08,570
Fuller!
Iknow.

78
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,611
-I miss him too.

79
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,232
hey, this is my brother.

80
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:23,907
Roger that, Candy Cane.
Aw, you got him. You got him!

81
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,811
Listen, before
you start writing anything--

82
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:42,719
License, please. Registration.
My brother's injail.

83
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,724
And I haven't seen him
in almost five years.

84
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:48,627
So, I'm like driving 200 miles
out of my way just to help him out.

85
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:52,465
That U-turn, it was based on
a whole, like, good deed scenario.

86
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:55,233
I'm also writing you up
for a broken taillight.

87
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:57,367
I have one of those?

88
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:03,443
Look, I'm aware of how frustrating...

89
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:05,646
the prisonsystem in this country
must be for you.

90
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:07,986
Repeat offenders,
the unrehabilitated--

91
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:11,893
I watch American Justice,
with your host, Bill Kurtis.

92
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:15,059
But I'm different.
I'm reformed.

93
00:06:15,135 --> 00:06:18,196
You know, I'm strong. I'm--

94
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:21,868
Officer Wilkins, this is my--
Listen, this is my pledge toyou.

95
00:06:21,943 --> 00:06:24,344
You will not be
seeing me again.

96
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:25,844
Well, what question's
more legit than that?

97
00:06:24,414 --> 00:06:27,111
Two strikes are enough
for Fuller Thomas.

98
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:29,380
hey.

99
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:37,118

Well, a lot better now.

105
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:55,489
Kid. Good to see you.

106
00:06:55,558 --> 00:06:57,789
You came all the way
to Salt Lake just for me?

107
00:06:57,861 --> 00:07:01,059
Well, technically,
you are still my brother.

108
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:03,897


109
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:08,700
I can't get--
Look atyou, man!

110
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:10,836

and take you wherever
it was you needed to go...

117
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:34,644
because I sorta need
to hit the road.

118
00:07:34,712 --> 00:07:38,309
Yeah, where are you goin'?
 Um, Boulder, Colorado...

119
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:41,548

Oh, perfect.

120

Yeah, that's great!
Wait, what?

121
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:50,057

123

00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,701

ofmine from backhome.

125
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,510
Wait, the blinker?
That girl from the heights?

126
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,348
The one who was like--
all day long?

127
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,822
No, she's not like that all day.
You haven't seen her in years.

128
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:10,326
Oh, okay.
You're fuckin' her?

129
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:13,192


130
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:21,437
We're just friends, okay?
Okay, you're not fucking her.

131
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:25,209
But you want to.
You don't know
what you're talking about.

132
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:28,117
Oh, I don't?
I don't know what I'm talking about?

133
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:30,314
All right, here's how it is:

134
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:33,519
Um, she's always dated guys
from the right side ofthe 'burbs.

135
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:36,793
You were always left on the side lines.
You get your scholarship to Berkeley.

136
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:39,866
She's off to the University
of Colorado. Right?

137
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:42,988
You don't understand.
You guys have been talking
on the phone alot...

138
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:46,868
and now she realizes thatyou have
the warm fuzzies for each other.

139
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:51,350
You're not lettin' on, even though
you scrambled and bought this car...

140
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:53,482
just to pickherup.

141
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,929

So, you're still good,

146
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,313
No more bullshit small talk.

147
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,594
About me, my relationships,
or my car.

148
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,433
Okay.

149
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:39,827
No, I swear. I'm barely
slowing the car in Denver.

150
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:42,200
I'll give him a seven-mile-an-hour
chance tojump and roll.

151
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:44,574
You did your mom...

00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:47,210
a big favor,
and she's happy now.

153
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:50,660
And this time tomorrow,
you'll be here with me...

level ofstress to deal with.

We're barrelin' down on ol'
Eye-8-Oh eastaway,just wonderin'...

00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:01,238

00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:10,625
All right, no cops

176
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:15,308
Free to speed like a motherfucker
for like the next 40miles orso.

177
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:22,293
Aren't we supposed
toget a hell of a downpour?

178
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:25,438
We got a 200-miles lipperslide.

179
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:28,717
Doesn't matter, not from this

180
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,697
Some people like it when it rains.

181
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:34,103
It's gonna rain hard tonight.

182
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:38,345
-Keeps everybody inside, you know.
-What the hell's with this guy?

183
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:41,093

184
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:44,193
You got Black Sheep here,
with Mama's Boy. Who we got? Over.

185
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,607
Could I please get a better handle
than Mama's Boy?

186
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:49,311
No.

187
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:51,323
Yo, Rain Man,

00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:56,603

00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,273

00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:05,466
No. Forget it.

192
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:08,133
You did a girl

00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:11,583
Oh, yeah, Mr. Schramm.

00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:13,624
That was good.
-No, I wasnine.

195
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,630
That was what I sounded like then.

196
00:12:15,698 --> 00:12:17,727
This is like a prehistoric Internet,
or something.

197
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:21,509
Come on! You fuck with
someone in a chatroom.

198
00:12:21,582 --> 00:12:24,078
It's the same thing.
-No, forgetit.

199
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:27,223
Come on, man!

200
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:31,802
Say, uh, "hey, Black Sheep,

201
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:35,552
Just say it.

202
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:38,930

00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:43,380

204
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:46,514

howdy there, Candy Cane.
This is Black Sheep.

206
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,638
I'm right on schedule.

207
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:53,975
Now, say, uh, ''I'll seeya

208
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:59,427
Go, go, go!

209
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:04,238

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,978

00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:10,492

Candy Cane, come on.

213
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,681
I knew it!
These guys are so fuckin' horny.

214
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:23,427
Get him goin'. Get him all worked up,
and then in the middle ofit...

215
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:26,670
say, hey, guess what?
I'm a dude.

216
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:29,081
No way. I can't do that.

217
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:31,420
Come on, man!
Come on.

218
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:33,623
Come on, man, it'll be fun.

219
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:36,137
Come on,just do it.

220
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:39,705
Do it.

221
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:43,922
hey there, who's this?

222
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:48,164


223
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:51,446
Rusty Nail.
Nice. Nice.

224
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,988
Well, Rusty Nail, I hope
you're doin' better than I am.

225
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:58,300
Man, this drive, it seems like
it's takin' forever.

226
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:00,345


227
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:08,729
You know what makes it easier
sometimes, is pretendin' the person...

228
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:10,741
that I'm talkin' to
is right next to me.

229
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:15,218
So, why don'tyoupretend
thatI'msittin'there withyou...

230
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:18,424
just the two ofus...
and the windshield?

231
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,996
Allright.

232
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:23,844
-Go, go! Tell him what you look like.
Shh!

233
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:28,886
So, I'm 5'1 0'', I got dirty-blond
hair down to my shoulders...

234
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:31,232
I got blue eyes,
really soft skin--

235
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,870
Wow, man.
This is turning me on.

236
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:37,320
And if I were there, Rusty Nail,
you know what I'd do?

237
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:41,262
Tellme.
Awesome!

238
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:43,671
I'd make you feel good.
]

239
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:46,010
You would?

240
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:49,581
If I were there and I asked you to,
would you unbutton my blouse?

241
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,791
Sure.

242
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:55,306
Well, then I'd just
take it off, so now what?

243
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:58,375
What do you want to do with me?

244
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:03,195
-I've never really done this before.
This is so classic!

245
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:06,402
I'd take off you rbra.

246
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:09,418
Ooh. Okay.
You take that off.

247
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:12,987


248
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,348
I couldn't hear that,
Rusty Nail.

249
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,585


250
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:26,804
That was almost so good!

251
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:29,538
Damn!
What, did we lose him?

252
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:33,112
Yeah. Shit!

253
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,929
hey, man, you're a gifted C.B.
prank callerwhen you commit to it.

254
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,498
I'd take off your bra.

255
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:04,926
Hey. hey, don't park
in a handicapped space.

256
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:07,469
There's spaces
all over the place.

257
00:16:07,537 --> 00:16:09,470
Yeah, I know.
That's my point.

258
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:12,439
Dude, I'm gonna gimp it.
I'm not just gonna run in there.

259
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:16,670
God! Just sit here.
I'll work us a deal, okay?

260
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:29,252
One more goddamn maid knocks
on my door askin' about towels--

261
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,516
Sorry, Mr. Ellinghouse.
That won'thappenagain.

262
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,058
Sorry, my ass!
Where's your boss?

263
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,617
I want the real manager.
The white one.

264
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,322
The one whose first language
is fuckin' English?

265
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:42,992
Can you understand that?
hi. Could I get a room for the night?

266
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:45,001
You can disturb me all you want.
I love towels.

267
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:47,002
Not done here, friend.
I know that, amigo. I'm just--

268
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,005
I haven't slept in two days.
You'd best not mess with me.

269
00:16:50,073 --> 00:16:52,870
You just take care of your own shit.
Peace.

270
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:55,740
Tomorrow mornin',
you mark my words, asshole--

271
00:16:57,813 --> 00:17:01,077
...a long talk
with your manager.

272
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:03,083
Your brown ass is gone.

273
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:05,876
Fuckin' punk.

274
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:17,391
What a dick.

275
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,663
Candy Cane.

276
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:29,570
Candy Cane.

277
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:34,737
hello?
Candy Cane?

278
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,716
Did you see that fat fucking guy?
Shh.

279
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:43,412
Listen.
hello, Candy Cane. Are you there?

280
00:17:43,486 --> 00:17:47,751
You are kidding me.
Can you believe that?

281
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:50,621
have you talked to him yet?
No.

282
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:53,353
I haven't said anything.

283
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:57,455
Anybody out there know Candy
Cane? Come on.

284
00:17:57,532 --> 00:18:01,297
What?

285
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:04,303
Tell him you want to meet up.
Tell him you want to get together.

286
00:18:04,371 --> 00:18:06,497
You're turnin' in for the night.

287
00:18:06,572 --> 00:18:08,904
You want to see him later
at the Lone Star Motel...

288
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:11,875
in Table Rock, Room 17.

289
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:13,911
Do you just love prison so much?

290
00:18:13,978 --> 00:18:16,776
We're in 1 8. I mean,
you saw that prick, right?
What, the giant?

291
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:19,646
The prick is in Room 17!

292
00:18:19,717 --> 00:18:21,650
Nah, I can't do that.

293
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:25,711
Come on! That guy sucks, okay?
he body-checked me on the way out.

294
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:29,383
Yeah, I know. I saw that.
What? You-You saw that?

295
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:33,020
And you're not jumping at this
extraordinary opportunity...

296
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:34,891
to exact some
much-deserved revenge?

297
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:36,828
Are you crazy?

298
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:38,832
Come on! Do it!

299
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,834
Calm down.
This is amazing!

300
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:46,705
]

301
00:18:46,774 --> 00:18:49,004


302
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:51,009
Rusty Nail. Hey, there.

303
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:57,940
Candy Cane.
I thought I'd lost ya.

304
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:01,443
Well, I guess fate
wouldn't allow that.

305
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,010
Glad to know you're
thinkin' about me.

306
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:07,649
Listen, I'm pullin'
over for the night.

307
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:11,216
You wouldn't be interested in
gettin' together later, would ya?

308
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:14,263
I thought you were
meeting with Black Sheep.

309
00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:19,666
Well, that was the plan, but
how about I blow him off...

310
00:19:19,735 --> 00:19:21,828
and take a chance with you?

311
00:19:21,904 --> 00:19:25,964
-God.
I love you, man. This is so great!

312
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,507
Relax.

313
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:30,203
But I'm not sure that
I'd be what you'd expect.

314
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,647
Please.

315
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:38,344
Well, you are a man, aren't you,
with a soul and a heart?

316
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:41,682
That's all I'd expect.
Great.

317
00:19:41,754 --> 00:19:45,588


318
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:51,560
in Table Rock,
if you're interested.

319
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,598
Pink champagne.

320
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:55,723
Tell him that you like
pink champagne.

321
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,733


322
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:04,037
it's my favorite.

323
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:06,632
That was good.

324
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:09,575
What room?

325
00:20:09,645 --> 00:20:13,513
Room 17. Midnight.
You got that, baby?

326
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:16,642
I got it.

327
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:20,585
I can't wait.

328
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:27,019
That was mean.
I know! I know! This is awesome!

329
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:31,756
That guy sucks, okay? he totally
body-checked me on the way out.

330
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,129
All you do is put
Do you miss home?

331
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,135
Yeah. I miss...

332
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,035
Mom's chocolate chip cookies.

333
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,869
Playin' football with Dad, Sundays.

334
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:51,108
Goin' to Oh, wait. That's
somebody else's childhood.

335
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:54,672
What I meant was,
''N-No-o.''

336
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:59,010
You should call sometimes.

337
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:01,021
You know, when
you don't need bail money.

338
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:03,023
Yeah, but how often is that?

339
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:07,084
I'm serious.
I call.

340
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:09,959
Yeah, I know exactly what he says
every time he hangs up the phone.

341
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,294
That I'm the world's biggest loser.

342
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:16,734
That's comin' from a plumber.

343
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:18,737
That's comin' from
a guy who wears...

344
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:23,241
a full-length lime green
jumpsuit to work every day.

345
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:25,572
They don't need me.
I don't need them.

346
00:21:25,644 --> 00:21:29,171
It works like a charm
if you repeat it enough.

347
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:33,706
Listen.

348
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:40,989
hit the TV.

349
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:53,157
Oh.
It's Rusty Nail! It's him!

350
00:21:57,739 --> 00:21:59,968
Shh.

351
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,634
Who the hell is it?

352
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:06,008
I brought the, uh, the drink.

353
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,079
This is amazing!

354
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:18,723
I brought the, uh,
pink champagne.

355
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:20,882
Is this a goddamn joke?

356
00:22:22,793 --> 00:22:24,727
I swear to fucking God.

357
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,965
What are you--Are you Black Sheep?

358
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:42,980
Why don't you come overhere?

359
00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:54,334
Are you fuckin' with me,
standing in the dark?

360
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,814
This prick is such an asshole!

361
00:22:56,883 --> 00:22:59,879
Show me your face. What was that?

362
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,317
That was weird.

363
00:23:26,223 --> 00:23:28,525
hey, you know what I think?

364
00:23:28,596 --> 00:23:31,262
I think someone
might have gotten hurt.

365
00:23:31,336 --> 00:23:34,332
No. No, we would
have heard that.

366
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,008
We did. That was a gasp.

367
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:40,023
Bet that Rusty Nail guygothurt.

368
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:43,863
No, it wasn't a gasp.
That was a laugh.

369
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:51,318
hey, where areyou going?

370
00:23:52,823 --> 00:23:54,885
What, areyou calling Mom?

371
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:56,898
Front desk.
hi, we just, uh--

372
00:23:56,966 --> 00:24:00,874
We just heard some disturbance from
the room next door, in, uh, Room 17.

373
00:24:00,943 --> 00:24:03,575
Yeah, hi, this is the drama queen
from Room 18

374
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,053
That's hard to say.
It was like a like a thud.

375
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:08,060
What are you--

376
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:10,293
No, we think someone
might have been hurt.

377
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:14,366
And we thought you'd want
to check that out, maybe.

378
00:24:14,444 --> 00:24:16,415
All right. Thankyou.

379
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:21,392
You know what's
gonna happen now, right?

380
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,432
Prick's gonna kill
the night manager.

381
00:24:52,505 --> 00:24:54,499
hello?

382
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,947
Guy said everything's fine.

383
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:01,253
Allright. Thank you.

384
00:25:17,034 --> 00:25:19,472
The guy said everything's fiine.

385
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,448
What'd I tell ya?

386
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,844
Goodmornin'.
how are you today?

387
00:26:03,918 --> 00:26:05,855
Pretty good.
how are you?

388
00:26:05,923 --> 00:26:09,557
Where are you boys from?
Originally, NewJersey.

389
00:26:09,632 --> 00:26:12,765
Uh-huh. What are you doin' here?
We're drivin' cross-country.

390
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,608
My brother-Yeah, Lewis.
Your brother?

391
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,552
Where is he?
In the room. I don't know.

392
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:21,389
We had a little incident here
last night. Did you hear anything--

393
00:26:21,462 --> 00:26:23,433
any sounds, or anything
out ofthe ordinary?

394
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,137
Yeah, actually, uh, uh, next door
I heard some sounds.

395
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:31,448
-Nextdoor?
Yeah.

396
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,121
-Could you describe those sounds?
Yeah, sure.

397
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:37,691
Theywere like, uh--

398
00:26:40,543 --> 00:26:42,480
No, wait.

399
00:26:42,548 --> 00:26:46,924
Like that.

400
00:26:46,993 --> 00:26:49,464
What's goin' on?
All right, this is Lewis.

401
00:26:49,532 --> 00:26:52,130
There was a ''sitchy-ashun''
last night. That's all I know.

402
00:26:52,206 --> 00:26:54,700
So after you heard these sounds,
uh, did you look out your window?

403
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:56,806
Did you open your door?
No, sir.

404
00:26:56,884 --> 00:27:00,518
What happened?
Afteryou closed your door,
around 10:15 P.M....

405
00:27:00,593 --> 00:27:02,963
you didn't see anybody else until
I knocked on your door this morning?

406
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:06,667
That's right. Well, we did call
the night manager, because we were...

407
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:08,975
uh, concerned, right?

408
00:27:09,048 --> 00:27:12,021
Right.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. he mentioned that.

409
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,723
And he also said that one ofyou
had an altercation with the victim.

410
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:19,831
Which ofyou was that?
Wait. The nightmanager said what?

411
00:27:19,908 --> 00:27:23,212
Apparently one ofyou had words
with the victim, in the motel offiice...

412
00:27:23,283 --> 00:27:26,189
when you were checkin' in?
No, no. We never met--

413
00:27:28,764 --> 00:27:30,461
What?
Ellinghouse.

414
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:32,802
Ronald Ellinghouse.
he was staying in Room 1 7.

415
00:27:34,011 --> 00:27:35,947
The huge guy?
Yeah, I met him.

416
00:27:36,016 --> 00:27:37,952
-Buthe's-he'snot the one--
What happened to him?

417
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,786
It wasn't comely.

418
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:45,402
I'm sorry. I don't know
what that means.

419
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:50,181
he was found early this mornin'
lyin' face down...

420
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,689
on the highway median.

421
00:27:52,757 --> 00:27:57,326
So, you're saying that the--

422
00:27:57,402 --> 00:27:59,339
the huge guy is the victim.

423
00:28:01,211 --> 00:28:06,282
You have no idea who might have visited
Mr. Ellinghouse's room last night?

424
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:10,163
No, sir.

425
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:13,208
I wish-I wish we could be
more helpful, but I--

426
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,077
Is he dead?
Coma.

427
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:19,824
You know what I'm thinkin'?

428
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:25,064
I'm thinkin' that a little look-see
might ''refreshify'' your memory.

429
00:28:27,377 --> 00:28:30,009
Takin' a look-see at what?

430
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:49,932
Ripped hisjaw...

431
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,564
clean off.

432
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,765
That is the pain in my ass.

433
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:07,112
My own personal file of on going shit
that I got to deal with.

434
00:29:07,183 --> 00:29:09,551
And now, guess what?

435
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,556
Now, I got me another one.

436
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,390
Mr. Ronald Ellinghouse...

437
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:18,528
layin' two inches from dead
in my jurisdiction.

438
00:29:18,604 --> 00:29:23,944
Why? Because you sorry-asspunks
thought you'd have some fun.

439
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,573
Fuck!

440
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,817
I'd keep you retards in custody
if I thought it would help answer...

441
00:29:29,892 --> 00:29:33,331
one of the hundreds
of new questions I got.

442
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:37,269
But, no. All you know
is his damn C.B. handle.

443
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:39,366
And maybe he drives a truck.

444
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:45,442
Doyou understand the kinds
of shit I got to grapple with now...

445
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:48,789
because ofwhat
you assholes did?

446
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,126
You! You got out ofjail when?

447
00:29:51,198 --> 00:29:54,193
Yesterday?

448
00:29:54,271 --> 00:29:59,144
I wantyou outta here.
This is like an old-fashioned western.

449
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:03,347
I want you out of Wyoming
before the sun goes down.

450
00:30:16,745 --> 00:30:19,272
I can't believe it.
I can't believe you told them that...

451
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,286
we invited Rusty Nail back.

452
00:30:21,354 --> 00:30:23,290
They could have
thrown me back injail.

453
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:25,419
A man is halfdead
because ofwhat we did.

454
00:30:25,495 --> 00:30:27,692
Oh, bullshit.

455
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:29,702
Bullshit!

456
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,536
What,you order ten pizzas
for your neighbor...

457
00:30:32,609 --> 00:30:35,877
a delivery guy gets there and
your neighbor opens up with an AK-47.

458
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:38,920
Is that your fault?
Yeah, maybe it is.

459
00:30:38,988 --> 00:30:41,356
Fine.
Be the martyr all you want.

460
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,360
No, that's not what I'm doin'.

461
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:46,161
I'm trying to fiigure how I'm gonna
drive away afterwhat we've done.

462
00:30:47,536 --> 00:30:49,802
Do what I do.

463
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:53,244
Just remind yourselfthat
in 1 00 years, you're gonna be dead.

464
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:55,307
It's the closest thing
I've got to a philosophy.

465
00:30:55,385 --> 00:30:57,685
No, you know what? I'm taking you
to Denver, and that's it.

466
00:30:57,756 --> 00:31:00,022
Great.

467
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:37,191
Eastbound, looking for a
westbound...

468
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:40,564
for a bear report?

469
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:44,005
Not a soul.
Never any Smokeys on that street

470
00:31:51,188 --> 00:31:53,522
...andy Ca--

471
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:56,798

Candy Cane?

476
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:17,670
Jesus.

477
00:32:19,642 --> 00:32:22,944
Anybody out there know
Candy Cane?

478
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:25,747
Or Mama's Boy?

479
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:29,225
Baa, baa, Black Sheep.

480
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:32,689
What are you gonna say?

481
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:35,761
This is Black Sheep.

482
00:32:39,078 --> 00:32:41,173
hey, Black Sheep.

483
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:47,185
Do you know
where Ican find Candy Cane?

484
00:32:48,562 --> 00:32:53,630
hey, uh,
what is your deal?

485
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:55,767
I mean, seriously.

486
00:32:55,843 --> 00:33:00,044
I'm looking forC.andy C.ane.

487
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:07,793
So, you've been
driving around all day...

488
00:33:07,865 --> 00:33:10,267
looking for a voice?

489
00:33:13,276 --> 00:33:17,443
I think that you can
tell me where to find her.

490
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:19,509
Tell him it was a joke.
-Uh, I talked to Candy Cane...

491
00:33:19,587 --> 00:33:22,080
about last night.

492
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,287
And she said
that she's not interested.

493
00:33:24,362 --> 00:33:26,799
No!
She's not interested in you--

494
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:31,366
Don't do this.
...or your pink champagne.

495
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:36,111
I need to find... Candy Cane.

496
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:40,387
You need to find...

497
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:43,397
a highly-qualified psychiatrist--

498
00:33:43,465 --> 00:33:46,767
not a psychologist--
you're gonna need some drugs.

499
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:48,808
You're gonna have to fiind
a damn good lawyer...

500
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,503
because the cops
are all over your ass.

501
00:33:50,578 --> 00:33:54,142
Goddamn!
Give it to me.

502
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:56,985
Hey, there,
Rusty Nail, you hear this?

503
00:33:57,057 --> 00:33:59,084
That was me, all right? I'm a guy.

504
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:02,395
It was just a joke.

505
00:34:02,468 --> 00:34:04,460
It was just a joke.

506
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:10,606
Apologize.

507
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,081
Right.
No,just do it.

508
00:34:14,156 --> 00:34:17,218
Apologize to him?
Yeah.

509
00:34:17,294 --> 00:34:19,230
I-I'll do it.
No.

510
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:23,405
Listen, you sick fuck...

511
00:34:23,473 --> 00:34:26,912
you pathetic,
lonely walkie-talkie...

512
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,746
freak show motherfucker, you're
not getting anything from me.

513
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:33,690
Know why? I have something
more powerful than your psychosis.

514
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:35,694
It's called a volume knob.

515
00:34:35,763 --> 00:34:39,702
And the only thing I need to make you
go away is to turn it counterclockwise.

516
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,901
Got that?
You copy that?

517
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:47,417
You know, Black Sheep,
you really ought to get that fiixed.

518
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,420
Get what fixed?

519
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:53,028
Your taillight.

520
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,407
-Do you see anything?
Yeah. Cars and trucks.

521
00:35:01,478 --> 00:35:04,746
-Just drive.Just be cool.
Oh, my God.

522
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:10,149
Did he follow us from the motel?
I don't know. I don't know.

523
00:35:10,228 --> 00:35:13,894
As long as we keep drivin',
we're safe. What?
Oh, God, look.

524
00:35:15,237 --> 00:35:18,037
Oh, come on, come on!
I know. But it's okay.

525
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:20,340
I saw a sign.
Gas at Laramie.

526
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:25,252
There'll be a phone there,
and I'll call Sheriff Ritter.
Oh, good.

527
00:35:25,322 --> 00:35:27,485
-Laramie. That'll be good.
We'llbeallright.

528
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,524
Oh, my God. Oh, God.
Okay, just stay cool.

529
00:35:32,602 --> 00:35:35,004
Oh, shit! Will you stop
telling me to be cool?
Keep cool.

530
00:35:35,073 --> 00:35:37,771
You're makin' me like, crazy.
Get the map.

531
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:41,045
Okay. All right.
Fuck! We're not gonna
make it to Laramie.

532
00:35:41,118 --> 00:35:43,612
Wait, take the next exit.
I think there's a town there.

533
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,625
how far is it? how far is it?
I don't know.

534
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:48,665
My cuticle to my knuckle.
I don't know. Twelve miles.

535
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:51,464
We might not make it twelve miles.
Take this exit right here.

536
00:35:57,248 --> 00:36:00,550
Yes!
Yes, you're a genius!

537
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:15,934
I'll pay, you pump. Or do you
want to pay? I don't care.

538
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:17,932
I'll pump.
Okay. Okay.

543
00:38:17,385 --> 00:38:19,940

554
00:39:17,026 --> 00:39:19,581

559
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:39,298
Okay-Damn it!
The guy's comin' after us.

560
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:42,334
Oh, no. Shit!Okay, we're not gonna
panic. We got a full tank of gas.

561

Right.
We missed the on-ramp, man!

562
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:56,920
Ooh, mailbox--

563
00:39:56,988 --> 00:39:59,110

Thanks, man. We thought--
You really scared us.

571
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,963
Yeah.
It wasn't the mustache, was it?

572
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:57,460
My old lady keeps telling
me to shave the thing.

573
00:40:57,529 --> 00:41:00,254
No, no. It wasn't
the mustache, man.

574
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:04,187

Yeah, pressure.

00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,840
Yeah, we're fiine.
Now that we're not murdered.

580
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,601

more of a pussy in my whole life.

584
00:41:36,724 --> 00:41:38,915
Oh, my God.

585
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:12,386

588
00:42:21,781 --> 00:42:24,540
Well, hey, you know,

00:42:24,612 --> 00:42:26,542

00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,937

that Rusty Nail's in the area.

591
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:33,026

A laugh?

00:45:58,246 --> 00:46:02,367
Well, I was

So, where are you now?

00:47:14,228 --> 00:47:17,055
We had some cartrouble, and, uh,
we're gonna be a little late.

624
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:20,985
That's allright.
Is everything okay?

625
00:47:21,053 --> 00:47:24,073

00:48:06,537 --> 00:48:08,999
Listen, I don't want

When did you get it?
I've had it for a while.

637
00:48:56,215 --> 00:48:58,576
It doesn't look too beat up.
No.

638
00:48:58,646 --> 00:49:00,768
No, actually, I think the dents
add some character.

639
00:49:00,843 --> 00:49:03,931

She'll be
my roommate nextyear.

649
00:49:36,537 --> 00:49:40,091
These are the infamous Thomas boys.
Oh, Lewis, right?

00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:42,595
Yeah. Nice to finally meet you.

651
00:49:42,664 --> 00:49:47,115
And, look, I'm Fuller. I'm Lewis's
older, somewhat troubled brother.

652
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,815
And you're definitely
goin' with us, right?

653
00:49:49,889 --> 00:49:51,876
I kind of have to go back
to San Antonio.

654
00:49:51,954 --> 00:49:54,746
Isn't San Antonio
on the way to New Jersey?

655

Yeah! Yeah, sure.

663
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:23,487
Shotgun? You want it,

I want to tell you how much
I appreciateyou doing this.

669
00:51:14,484 --> 00:51:17,410
Picking me up.

670
00:51:17,478 --> 00:51:20,233
It's pretty much the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

671
00:51:29,785 --> 00:51:34,004
This is the part
where you kiss the girl.

672
00:51:36,138 --> 00:51:38,531
Well, historically.

673
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,889

674
00:52:04,846 --> 00:52:08,169

678
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:25,268
Three tequilas.

679
00:52:25,338 --> 00:52:27,855
All right.

680
00:52:30,926 --> 00:52:35,077
Well, I can, uh, tie a knot
in a cherry stem with my tongue.

681
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:37,577
Shut up!
Uh-huh.

682
00:52:37,645 --> 00:52:39,573
All right, choose your weapon.

683
00:52:39,641 --> 00:52:41,660
Let's see what you're made of.

684
00:52:42,734 --> 00:52:45,717
And... go.
Mm.

685
00:52:53,213 --> 00:52:55,141
Done.
Mm-hmm.

686
00:52:56,872 --> 00:52:58,891
Still medalled.

687
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:00,896
Bronze.
Not even close.

688
00:53:00,964 --> 00:53:03,152
Oh, it's straight. It wasn't even bent.

689
00:53:24,249 --> 00:53:26,903
May I have
three more shots of tequila...

690
00:53:26,977 --> 00:53:29,835
and some matches, please?
What's your name, sweetheart?

691
00:53:35,891 --> 00:53:38,908
Come on, what's your name?
hmm?

692
00:53:38,985 --> 00:53:41,605
Oh, what's your name, sweet thing?

693
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,538
I'm just here to buy drinks.
You can call me what ever you want.

694
00:53:44,607 --> 00:53:46,966
how 'bout I call you Peaches?
Do you like Peaches?

695
00:53:47,035 --> 00:53:49,621
No, not really.
Oh, you don't like Peaches?

696
00:53:49,696 --> 00:53:51,783
hey, what's goin' on?
What?

697
00:53:51,859 --> 00:53:54,785
Is this your bitch?
Excuse me?

698
00:53:54,852 --> 00:53:58,107
Excuse me, I said...

699
00:53:58,179 --> 00:54:00,833
is this your bitch?

700
00:54:00,907 --> 00:54:03,890
'Cause if it is, you better
shut your bitch up.

701
00:54:03,967 --> 00:54:08,686
hey, look at me, campus boy. huh?
Did you hear what I said?

702
00:54:08,758 --> 00:54:10,414
Look me in the face.

703
00:54:10,487 --> 00:54:14,071
You better shut your bitch... up.

704
00:54:14,146 --> 00:54:17,231
Bitch, shut up!
Are you mouthin' off again? God!

705
00:54:17,307 --> 00:54:21,922
Damn it! You can't turn your back
for one minute, you know.

706
00:54:21,996 --> 00:54:24,287
I owe you one.
Now, come on!

707
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:27,217
Back on the truckwith you, Daisy!

708
00:54:27,286 --> 00:54:30,473
Drunk in the bar!
Now, come on!

709
00:54:30,546 --> 00:54:32,769
Goddamnit!

710
00:54:32,841 --> 00:54:34,769
Gentlemen.

711
00:54:40,857 --> 00:54:43,081
Careful, those are expensive.

712
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:46,637
Ohh.

713
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,628
What?

714
00:54:54,696 --> 00:54:57,588
-hey.

715
00:54:57,657 --> 00:54:59,585
hey!

716
00:55:01,682 --> 00:55:03,610
hey.

717
00:55:04,609 --> 00:55:06,400
I got a plan.

718
00:55:06,472 --> 00:55:09,590
And what's your plan?
Let's never go back there again.

719
00:55:09,665 --> 00:55:13,215
Oh, I can't wait
to never go back there.

720
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:16,546
Yeah.

721
00:55:16,618 --> 00:55:18,943
I'll be in my presidential suite.

722
00:55:20,809 --> 00:55:23,792
Excellent.
We're gonna head to our--

723
00:55:23,869 --> 00:55:27,056
our spinning hotel room.
Okay. See you later.

724
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:31,951
Good night.

725
00:55:37,607 --> 00:55:39,536
I get the orange one!

726
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:42,895
This one.

727
00:55:49,217 --> 00:55:51,610
hey! See, I told you
this was a good place.

728
00:55:51,678 --> 00:55:53,935
Adult channels.

729
00:55:54,007 --> 00:55:56,593
Good. hey, are you
in the mood for...

730
00:55:56,668 --> 00:56:00,042
a story, or, like,
a collection of scenes?

731
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:05,437
She isn't a Navy SEAL.

732
00:56:05,513 --> 00:56:07,950
God! Takes me right out.

733
00:56:08,019 --> 00:56:12,393
hey, Venna's great, man.

734
00:56:12,462 --> 00:56:16,266
She's got--

735
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:21,510
I mean, you guys--
You guys are just friends, right?

736
00:56:23,253 --> 00:56:25,986
I mean,
that's what you said.

737
00:56:26,059 --> 00:56:29,521
Right? You're just--
just hangin' out, and--

738
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:34,874
'Cause if you're anything
more than that...

739
00:56:34,945 --> 00:56:38,282
you tell me right now,
and I'm gonna just-I'll--

740
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,918
...off.

741
00:56:41,994 --> 00:56:44,831
You know?

742
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,905
Great.

743
00:56:55,747 --> 00:56:57,973
Oh, we never got
those last drinks.

744
00:56:58,046 --> 00:57:01,702
Yeah, um...

745
00:57:01,776 --> 00:57:03,797
you know, ifwe're gonna
get an early start...

746
00:57:03,874 --> 00:57:06,133
we should probably
just crash and go to bed.

747
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:08,396
Yeah. But, hey...

748
00:57:08,469 --> 00:57:11,557
I'm a-I'm a licensed bartender.

749
00:57:12,966 --> 00:57:16,622
Yeah, I'd show you my license,
but my hands are full, so--

750
00:57:16,696 --> 00:57:20,056
Oh. Where's your better half?

751
00:57:20,126 --> 00:57:22,817
he's busy. Snoring.

752
00:57:24,355 --> 00:57:28,307
Well, you know, I really don't
think that I can drink anymore.

753
00:57:28,385 --> 00:57:32,076
I disagree.
And I'm a professional.

754
00:57:36,944 --> 00:57:40,237
Youknow what'samazing?

755
00:57:40,308 --> 00:57:42,794
Nobodyknows
where weare rightnow.

756
00:57:44,904 --> 00:57:48,731
Just kinda...

757
00:57:48,801 --> 00:57:50,731
out there.

758
00:57:52,098 --> 00:57:55,186
Floating.

759
00:57:55,262 --> 00:57:59,315
If anybody wanted to find us
for some strange reason...

760
00:57:59,391 --> 00:58:02,048
they couldn't.

761
00:58:02,122 --> 00:58:05,085
What am I talking about?

762
00:58:05,153 --> 00:58:07,981
I have no idea. here, try this.

763
00:58:19,707 --> 00:58:22,262
Yeah!
Yeah.

764
00:58:22,338 --> 00:58:24,995
Is Lewis okay?
he doesn't normally drink so much.

765
00:58:26,734 --> 00:58:28,664
Yeah, he's totally fiine.

766
00:58:39,622 --> 00:58:42,609
Fuller, get the phone.

767
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:00,828
hello.

768
00:59:00,903 --> 00:59:04,025
Now I thought
you said there was no girl.

769
00:59:04,101 --> 00:59:08,121
What?
You said there was no girl.

770
00:59:08,197 --> 00:59:10,128
Fuller.

771
00:59:15,724 --> 00:59:19,585
Listen, there--
There isn't any girl.

772
00:59:19,654 --> 00:59:24,911
Then, what's she doing
in the other room with your brother?

773
00:59:38,304 --> 00:59:40,733
he's out there!

774
00:59:40,802 --> 00:59:42,426
he's watching us!
Rusty Nail?

775
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,327
he just called me.
Who's Rusty Nail?
he called you on the phone?

776
00:59:45,397 --> 00:59:48,418
Yeah,just now. he knew you were
in here. he's watching us!

777
00:59:48,494 --> 00:59:50,720
There's somebody watching us?
he just called.
What did he say?

778
00:59:50,793 --> 00:59:53,915
he said, ''I thought there was no girl.''
And whatyou were doing...

779
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,977
in the room with her,
which is an excellent question.

780
00:59:56,055 --> 00:59:59,177
We're gettin' out ofhere, so
put on your shoes.
I already paid for this room.

781
00:59:59,252 --> 01:00:01,909
-Just do it!
how scared am I supposed to be?

782
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:13,471
Much more than usual.

783
01:00:49,874 --> 01:00:52,100
Okay, there's nobody behind us.
Can somebody please talk to me?

784
01:00:52,171 --> 01:00:54,102
he knows we're brothers.
how does that happen?

785
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:56,997
All right, we're goin' to the police,
we're gettin' offthe highway...

786
01:00:57,067 --> 01:01:00,031
then we're goin' home!
Lewis, goddamn it!

787
01:01:00,099 --> 01:01:02,619
Something weird happened to us
before we picked you up.

788
01:01:02,696 --> 01:01:05,716
I didn't wanna tell you 'cause
I didn't wanna freak you out.
Tell me what?

789
01:01:05,793 --> 01:01:09,018
You want the short version?
Talk tome.

790
01:01:09,091 --> 01:01:11,952
There's this sick guy.
he put this guy in a coma.
Sick how?

791
01:01:12,021 --> 01:01:14,678
This Rusty Nailguy
didsomething?

792
01:01:14,752 --> 01:01:16,978
Because of something that we did.
What did you do?

793
01:01:23,445 --> 01:01:25,375
hey, man, what the hell
are you doing?

794
01:01:26,674 --> 01:01:29,070
he wants us
to look in the trunk.

795
01:01:30,238 --> 01:01:32,497
There were signs
spray painted back there:

796
01:01:32,569 --> 01:01:34,500
''Look in the trunk.''

797
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,194
Signs? What makes you think
they're for us?

798
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:41,894
Look.

799
01:01:44,858 --> 01:01:47,049
What's going on here?

800
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:54,773
That's a pretty elaborate
thing to do, paint those signs.

801
01:01:54,849 --> 01:01:57,109
No, no, no! No!
What? God!

802
01:01:57,181 --> 01:01:59,111
Don't open it!
Why?

803
01:01:59,179 --> 01:02:02,938
What ifthere's a head
or a body in there, man?
Oh, man, could be a bomb.

804
01:02:03,009 --> 01:02:05,871
Think a bomb's a reason
not to open the trunk?
he's in the trunk!

805
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,802
I say we don't open the trunk!

806
01:02:07,872 --> 01:02:11,528
I'm not getting back into the car
till I know what's in the trunk.

807
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:13,793
What areyou doing?

808
01:02:22,359 --> 01:02:24,845
Oh, shit.

809
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:29,840
Okay, we plug it in,
and we don't talk on it.

810
01:02:29,919 --> 01:02:32,440
We just listen.

811
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:35,571
And whatever he says, we just--
We just go straight to the police.

812
01:02:35,647 --> 01:02:38,372
I'm not going to go anywhere...

813
01:02:38,444 --> 01:02:41,431
until somebody tells me why
I should be afraid ofa radio.

814
01:03:02,057 --> 01:03:04,577
Candy Cane, are you there?

815
01:03:07,086 --> 01:03:09,811
Oh, that's right.

816
01:03:09,884 --> 01:03:14,210
I don't mean my Candy Cane.

817
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,835
I mean yours.

818
01:03:16,911 --> 01:03:19,397
Venna?

819
01:03:19,475 --> 01:03:23,494
how does he know my name?
We're not getting into it
with this guy.

820
01:03:23,571 --> 01:03:26,194
Let him talk all he wants.
Just tell me where we're going.

821
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:28,529
You know when a corpse
can't be identifiied?

822
01:03:28,601 --> 01:03:33,790
No next of kin.
No one to claim the body.

823
01:03:33,863 --> 01:03:38,416
What they do is,
they cut off all the fingers.

824
01:03:38,492 --> 01:03:40,718
All ten of them.

825
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:43,219
And then they cut off the jaw.

826
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:46,298
They cut off
the person's jaw...

827
01:03:47,643 --> 01:03:51,779
and they put it all in a jar.

828
01:03:51,853 --> 01:03:57,766
They put it in a jar
with some number on it.

829
01:04:05,251 --> 01:04:07,951
Oh, my God, that's Charlotte.

830
01:04:08,024 --> 01:04:09,961
What?
That's Charlotte.

831
01:04:10,029 --> 01:04:12,364
That girl? Your roommate?
Yeah, yeah.

832
01:04:13,938 --> 01:04:16,466
hey, what the hell do you want?

833
01:04:16,545 --> 01:04:21,454
I wantyou to go to the State Line
Truck Stop parking lot.

834
01:04:21,522 --> 01:04:24,690
I'll fiindyou there.
Venna, please help me!

835
01:04:24,764 --> 01:04:27,429
And if you go to the police...

836
01:04:27,504 --> 01:04:32,209
I will take her apart
piece by piece.

837
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,204
Good morning.

838
01:04:59,279 --> 01:05:04,314
hey, he's back.
We're here.

839
01:05:04,391 --> 01:05:09,665
Okay, here's what I want.
Fuller, Lewis...

840
01:05:09,736 --> 01:05:13,473
I want you two
to head inside.

841
01:05:13,546 --> 01:05:16,383
Take a seat at the counter.

842
01:05:16,453 --> 01:05:20,189
Order six cheeseburgers each.

843
01:05:22,267 --> 01:05:24,203
What about Venna?

844
01:05:24,271 --> 01:05:26,971
She stays put.

845
01:05:27,044 --> 01:05:32,045
But you two are
going in... naked.

846
01:05:32,123 --> 01:05:34,060
Naked?

847
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:41,169
If we go in there dicks hangin'...

848
01:05:43,082 --> 01:05:45,553
they're just gonna call the police.

849
01:05:45,622 --> 01:05:49,688
Aw, come on.
It's just for fun.

850
01:05:49,765 --> 01:05:51,702
Bullshit,
I'm staying here.

851
01:05:53,808 --> 01:05:56,713
Just stay up front.
I wantyou to keep the car running.

852
01:05:56,782 --> 01:05:59,276
And if you see anything,
honk the horn and drive.

853
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:06,063
God, I can't fucking believe
we're doing this.

854
01:06:15,827 --> 01:06:18,595
Billy, come on.
Get in the car.

855
01:06:18,667 --> 01:06:20,603
Sissy.

856
01:06:26,552 --> 01:06:28,488


857
01:06:33,669 --> 01:06:36,039
to be the brunt of the joke.

858
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:40,548
Your heart pounding.

859
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:42,988
Face burning hot.

860
01:06:43,058 --> 01:06:46,966
Now they know what it feels like...

861
01:06:47,034 --> 01:06:50,474
tobe the fuckingpunch line.

862
01:06:50,542 --> 01:06:54,712
They told me what they did
toyou, and I'm very, very sorry.

863
01:06:54,785 --> 01:06:57,257
Well, it's a little late
for that, isn't it?

864
01:06:57,325 --> 01:06:59,592
I bet your friends
had a really good laugh...

865
01:06:59,664 --> 01:07:04,437
seeing me standing there
in the rain, holding my bottle.

866
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:20,441
Well, that's a lesson your friends are
gonna have to learn the hard way.

867
01:07:20,513 --> 01:07:22,643
You wanna see Charlotte alive again?

868
01:07:22,718 --> 01:07:24,655
here's what you're gonna have to do.

869
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:32,970
Twelve cheeseburgers, please.

870
01:07:35,983 --> 01:07:38,580
You want fries with that?

871
01:07:42,364 --> 01:07:45,861
Is this a fraternity stunt?

872
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,911
Because if this wasn't
my restaurant--

873
01:07:47,978 --> 01:07:50,883
A man's gonna kill our friend
if we don't come in here like this.

874
01:07:50,952 --> 01:07:53,014
I'd say it was
a pretty good one.

875
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:56,531
We're not joking, man.
Oh, shit!

876
01:08:02,512 --> 01:08:04,483
Man, we should be going to the cops.

877
01:08:04,551 --> 01:08:07,182
We're not going anywhere
till we find out what he wants.

878
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:13,700
Right up here.
This is where we turn.

879
01:08:13,772 --> 01:08:16,609
That's-That's what he said.

880
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:48,817
You out there?

881
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,554
We're here.

882
01:08:52,631 --> 01:08:55,125
Something special's
waiting for you.

883
01:08:55,204 --> 01:08:58,006
I'd say it's about
a hundred feet up the road.

884
01:08:58,077 --> 01:09:01,381
So, get out of the car.

885
01:09:01,452 --> 01:09:03,514
Wait. I'm not walkin'
one foot out of this--

886
01:09:03,591 --> 01:09:05,618
We don't have a choice.
We're doing what he says.

887
01:09:05,696 --> 01:09:08,190
What? he's-he's got Charlotte.
Get out ofthe car.

888
01:09:08,268 --> 01:09:11,503
Wait!Goddamnit!
-Get out of the car!

889
01:09:18,259 --> 01:09:20,856
What the hell is this?

890
01:09:20,931 --> 01:09:22,868
Wait, how many feet did he say?

891
01:09:22,936 --> 01:09:25,271
A hundred. huh? A hundred.

892
01:09:33,929 --> 01:09:35,923
Do you hear
or see anything?

893
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,004
This is it.

894
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

895
01:16:45,098 --> 01:16:48,732
thing won'tstart.

896
01:16:48,807 --> 01:16:50,743
Uh, hello.

897
01:16:54,353 --> 01:16:56,619
hey.

898
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,929
hey.
Need some help?

899
01:17:02,003 --> 01:17:04,942
No, I think we're fine.
Damn Ford won't start.

900
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:08,107
And he wonders why I drive a Chevy.
No shit.

901
01:17:08,184 --> 01:17:11,589
Come on. Come on.

902
01:17:11,658 --> 01:17:14,255
I got some jumper cables.
I'll hook you up.

903
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:17,895
Uh, no, no, really.
I thinkwe're all right.

904
01:17:17,972 --> 01:17:20,944
It's just flooded, right?
You'll get it started.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

905
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:24,646
-Just take it and turn it
all the way off, then on.
Right.

906
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:28,023
Want me to show you?
You gotta hesitate it for two seconds.

907
01:17:30,233 --> 01:17:33,364
There it is.
All right, perfect.

908
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:35,672
hey, you're the man.
Thanks a lot.

909
01:17:42,927 --> 01:17:46,458
Where the hell you goin'?
That's my truck!

910
01:17:48,005 --> 01:17:51,172
Everything's going to be all right.

911
01:17:51,245 --> 01:17:53,580
We're gonna get Venna.

912
01:17:54,987 --> 01:17:57,823
And we're gonna find Charlotte.

913
01:17:59,564 --> 01:18:02,162
Everything's--
Everything's gonna be okay.

914
01:18:04,241 --> 01:18:06,712
Don't you think?

915
01:18:10,221 --> 01:18:12,192
I wonder

916
01:18:12,259 --> 01:18:16,633
My little darling

917
01:18:16,702 --> 01:18:19,230
Where can you be

918
01:18:19,307 --> 01:18:23,443
This moonlit night

919
01:18:25,622 --> 01:18:28,959
Okay, motel. Motel.

920
01:18:32,871 --> 01:18:36,642
Which one?
-he didn't say. Shit!

921
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:41,018
My heart
My heart is aching

922
01:18:47,036 --> 01:18:51,171

925
01:18:56,959 --> 01:19:01,663
Venna!
-I said hold on!

926
01:19:01,735 --> 01:19:03,729
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

927
01:19:04,809 --> 01:19:08,716
Baby, since we're through

928
01:19:08,784 --> 01:19:11,415
I've been through lovers'lane

929
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:13,518
Oh, but in my heart

930

There's only pain

01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:23,476
You went travelin'
but will it last

Is this your room?
Yeah. What ofit?

935
01:19:36,011 --> 01:19:40,818
It's where, where
where it'll be

936
01:19:40,889 --> 01:19:43,588
If this new love dies

937
01:19:43,662 --> 01:19:46,897
Oh! Oh! Oh!

938
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:49,304

What's the problem here?

Shit!

942
01:20:01,201 --> 01:20:04,197
Baby, since we're through

Oh, but in my heart

945
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,759
There's only pain

946
01:20:16,769 --> 01:20:20,334
You've been travelin'
but will it last

947
01:20:21,946 --> 01:20:23,917
hello, police.

948
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:28,324
Yeah. I'd like to report
some dead bodies.

949
01:20:28,394 --> 01:20:31,367
Your name, sir?

950
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,981
hello?

951
01:20:54,052 --> 01:20:56,888

952
01:21:01,802 --> 01:21:05,139

953
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:11,817
It's unlocked.
Comin'in.

954
01:21:15,064 --> 01:21:17,866
hey, we're comin' in.
We're comin' in.

955
01:21:22,581 --> 01:21:25,885
Venna? hello?

956
01:21:32,303 --> 01:21:34,240
Venna?

957
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:48,571
Oh, the switch.

958
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,406
hello?
Nice, isn't it...

959
01:22:04,475 --> 01:22:06,638
being on the receiving end?

960
01:22:08,016 --> 01:22:10,579
Where the hell's Venna?
Who?

961
01:22:10,655 --> 01:22:12,785
Look, I'm not kidding.
Where's Venna?

962
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:16,129
You see, you might not
be kidding, but I am.

963
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,139
What did he say?
That's the point.

964
01:22:19,207 --> 01:22:22,647
Get it?
No, believe me...

965
01:22:22,715 --> 01:22:24,651
you made your point, all right?

966
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,747
And we're sorry.
We told you that.

967
01:22:26,824 --> 01:22:30,229
hey, Lewis, you know what
I think is a real kick?

968
01:22:30,298 --> 01:22:35,641
Pretending the person that
I'm talking to is right next to me.

969
01:22:35,711 --> 01:22:38,547
Right next to me.
What?

970
01:22:39,753 --> 01:22:41,689
What the fuck is he talking--

971
01:22:43,895 --> 01:22:46,731
Not whatyou expected, is it?

972
01:22:46,801 --> 01:22:52,246
That's not what I expected
when I came to room 1 7, neither.

973
01:22:52,314 --> 01:22:56,050
You guys sittin' right nextdoor...

974
01:22:56,123 --> 01:22:58,993
listening through the wall.

975
01:22:59,062 --> 01:23:02,935
That's what you did, right?
You listened through the wall.

976
01:23:06,412 --> 01:23:08,349
What do you want?

977
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:13,190
I just want to enjoy this forasecond.

978
01:23:13,261 --> 01:23:15,424
We gotta call the cops.

979
01:23:15,499 --> 01:23:18,562
No. If we call the cops,
he'll kill her.

980
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:20,701
Well, what the fuck, man?
You--

981
01:23:20,777 --> 01:23:23,613
I think you should go outside.

982
01:23:23,684 --> 01:23:25,654
See if you can see in his room.
Are you crazy?

983
01:23:25,721 --> 01:23:30,163
Just do it! I'll keep him on the phone.
Go out there now. Go.

984
01:23:47,369 --> 01:23:49,372
Shit

985
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:52,741
You still there?
Oh, yeah, I'm here.

986
01:23:52,813 --> 01:23:56,807
Why don'tyoucome on over?
Your Candy Cane's waiting.

987
01:24:11,372 --> 01:24:14,035
Listen. We learned
our lesson, allright?

988
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:16,909
Oh, is that right?
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

989
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:19,506
So, this is what
we're gonna do, okay?

990
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,576
You're gonna
give us back Venna...

991
01:24:21,653 --> 01:24:25,489
then Charlotte and we're gonna
walk away from this whole thing.

992
01:24:25,559 --> 01:24:27,494
And we're not gonna
tell anybody, allright?

993
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:30,054
And we sure a shell
won't tell the cops.

994
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

995
01:25:15,264 --> 01:25:17,699
Don't!

996
01:25:17,768 --> 01:25:20,830
Don't open the door!

997
01:25:20,906 --> 01:25:24,206
Don't open the door!
Don't open the door!
Don't open the door!

998
01:25:35,493 --> 01:25:38,760
Come on!

Fuller?

1003
01:26:36,682 --> 01:26:39,244
Fuller?

1004
01:26:40,554 --> 01:26:43,023
Fuller, come on.
Let's getyou offthis.

1005
01:26:43,091 --> 01:26:47,029
Aah! Don't!

01:26:47,097 --> 01:26:50,967
Pipe! Jesus, there's a pipe
in my leg!

1007
01:26:51,036 --> 01:26:53,471
Aah!

1008
01:27:08,729 --> 01:27:10,857
We've got a body in here!

1009
01:27:10,932 --> 01:27:12,901
We've got a possible 839!
Search every room!

1010
01:27:15,905 --> 01:27:21,174
Oh,jeez!
What is he doing?

1011
01:27:24,985 --> 01:27:27,716
Come on, come on, come on!

1013
01:27:33,064 --> 01:27:35,590
