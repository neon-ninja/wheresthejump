<i>so once we arrive, please exit the train.</i><i></i>

186
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
<i>I repeat,</i><i></i>

187
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
<i>DAEJEON STATION is our last stop.</i><i></i>

188
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Which cities can be entered?

189
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Yeosu, Uljin, Busan. What about Daejeon?

190
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Excuse me, I need to use it.

191
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
What about Daejeon?

192
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Why not?!

193
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,300
Sweetie, stay put.

194
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,300
Hey, kiddo.

195
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,300
-Yes?

196
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,000
Who is he? Your dad?

197
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
-Yes

198
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Real dad? -Yes.

199
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I wanna know.

200
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
What does he do?

201
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
-He's a fund manager.

202
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Fund manager? -Yes

203
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
He's a bloodsucker.

204
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
He leaches off others.

205
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
-Don't say that in front of his child.

206
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It's okay

207
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
That's what everyone thinks,

208
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
-Want some?

209
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
-It's what Sleepy eats.

210
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
-This is Sleepy. Say hello.

211
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Baby's name is Sleepy?

212
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
-No, the fetus name.

213
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
-It's like a nickname,

214
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
-He's daddy too lazy to come up with a name yet.

215
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Touch her belly.

216
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
-Right here.

217
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
-Go on.

218
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
-Felt it?

219
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I made that.

220
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
-You idiot... -But it's true, No?

221
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
(Analyst Kim)

222
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
<i>Mr. Suh, you called me at a bad time.</i><i></i>

223
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Wait, Wait!

224
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Let me ask you something,

225
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
<i>What?</i><i></i>

226
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I'm on KTX to Daejeon.

227
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
<i>KTX? Right this minute?</i><i></i>

228
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Yes, I'm almost there,

229
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Is it true military is deployed in Daejeon?

230
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
<i>Yes, that's correct.</i><i></i>

231
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Is that so? It must be safe there.

232
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
<i>Well...It's...</i><i></i>

233
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Min, It is safe, right?

234
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
<i>Once you arrive, you'll be quarantined.</i><i></i>

235
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
What?

236
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm with my daughter.

237
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Can you help me and my daughter?

238
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
<i>But the thing is...</i><i></i>

239
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'll get you a real scoop, do me a favor.

240
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
<i>Don't go to the main square, come to the East one.</i><i></i>

241
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
<i>I'll let my men know.</i><i></i>

242
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Okay, thank you. Thanks so much.

243
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
All dead... All dead...

244
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
What's going on?

245
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So quiet.

246
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Is it Daejeon?

247
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
There's nobody.

248
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Why isn't anyone here?

249
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
What's going on back there?

250
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
This is that violent incident i told you about.

251
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
-Your'e the conductor?  -Yes.

252
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
How many can fit in the engine car?

253
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
We must uncouple it and go to Busan.

254
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
-Uncouple? -Yes!

255
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
-We can't! -Why not?!

256
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It can't be done here.

257
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Then, where's the Military?

258
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Right...

259
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I only recieved a report about it...

260
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
-Where's my business card...

261
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
-I'm COO of Stallion Express,

262
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
-all routes into Daejeon are cut off.

263
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
-our busses are all rerouted

264
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,300
But what for?

265
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
The City's been quarantined!

266
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
They probably won't let us in.

267
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
But Busan is still open, let's go there!

268
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
-Wait, if that's true...

269
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
-We just take others.  -Take Who?!

270
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
-Let's check the station first.

271
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Hey!

272
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Dammit!

273
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
RESTRICTED AREA

274
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Don't mind them

275
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Come on sweetie.

276
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Where are we going?

277
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
We're going this way.

278
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
-Just us? -Yes, Let's go.

279
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
What is it?

280
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm going this way too.

281
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Main square is that way, just follow other people.

282
00:42:36,816 --> 00:42:38,416
I heard your phone call.

283
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,914
About pulling you two out.

284
00:42:42,873 --> 00:42:45,140
I know others will be quarantined.

285
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:48,549
It's not true, Su-an.

286
00:42:49,107 --> 00:42:50,707
I'll go tell the others.

287
00:42:50,742 --> 00:42:54,275
- You don't have to. - Of course I do!

288
00:42:54,368 --> 00:42:56,635
Forget them! We're all on our own!

289
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:02,013
You only care about yourself.

290
00:43:04,737 --> 00:43:07,958
That's why mommy left.

291
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,630
Sweetie...

292
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:33,248

Hold on!

297
00:44:15,832 --> 00:44:17,232
Go back up! Go! Go!

No! my friends aren't here yet!

335

Those onboard must survive!

Ain't I right?

337
00:49:01,611 --> 00:49:02,611

Control, 101 could not dock
at Daejeon due to outbreak.

345

Advise which station is
available to dock, over.

346
00:51:07,868 --> 00:51:12,697
<i>101, due to unstable comm,
it is difficult to advise.</i>

347
00:51:13,049 --> 00:51:17,852
Control, is 101 clear to reach Busan? Over.

348
00:51:20,904 --> 00:51:24,155
<i>101, we'll clear your route to Busan.</i>

00:51:26,443 --> 00:51:29,110
Advise when you make contact with Busan.

352
00:51:29,967 --> 00:51:30,967
101, out.

353
00:52:47,435 --> 00:52:48,935

Were you able to contact Busan?

<i>No, the communication is erratic.</i>

Young-guk, where are you?

363
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,760
I thought you were dead!

364
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:30,458
I'm sorry!

365
00:53:33,015 --> 00:53:34,348
No one else made it!

366
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:37,494
I'm sorry.

367
00:53:48,698 --> 00:53:49,831
- Baby? <i>- Mister!</i>

368
00:53:51,844 --> 00:53:54,578
Huh? Why are you answering? Where are you?

369
00:53:54,575 --> 00:53:56,503
<i>We're in the train washroom!</i>

370
00:53:56,638 --> 00:53:59,638
Washroom? which car?

371
00:53:59,872 --> 00:54:02,329
<i>Well... it's...</i>

372
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:03,371
Car 13!

373
00:54:04,191 --> 00:54:06,324
- Get your ass over here! - Baby

374
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:11,855
Was that my kid? Is she okay?

375
00:54:12,777 --> 00:54:14,044
Washroom in car 13.

376
00:54:28,835 --> 00:54:30,083
Gonna pass through?

377
00:54:32,513 --> 00:54:34,856
Let's say you got through and rescue them,

378
00:54:34,856 --> 00:54:35,313
how will you come back?
Let's say you got through and rescue them,

379
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:36,389
how will you come back?

380
00:54:41,354 --> 00:54:42,354
In car 15,

381
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:46,063
people are gathered there.

382
00:54:52,354 --> 00:54:53,354
<i>Car 9</i>

383
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,241
Only 4 cars away.

384
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,740
I'll lead,

385
00:55:17,617 --> 00:55:18,817
you in the middle,

386
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:21,800
and you in the back.

387
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:27,055
Block anyone attacking from the rear.

388
00:55:37,026 --> 00:55:40,781
I heard you're a fund manager.

389
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:45,397
Then you're an expert,

390
00:55:46,954 --> 00:55:49,154
at leaving useless people behind.

391
00:55:55,814 --> 00:55:57,747
Wait till we exit the tunnel.

392
00:56:12,511 --> 00:56:13,511
Let's go.

393
00:57:24,401 --> 00:57:25,401
Come on!

394
00:57:28,524 --> 00:57:29,524
Let's go!

395
00:57:45,967 --> 00:57:46,967
Move.

396
00:59:31,245 --> 00:59:32,245
Out of the way.

397
00:59:36,209 --> 00:59:39,342
They stopped once we
entered the tunnel, right?

398
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:42,324
Probably because of darkness.

399
00:59:42,324 --> 00:59:42,577
Yeah, I think so too.
Probably because of darkness.

400
00:59:42,577 --> 00:59:43,724
Yeah, I think so too.

401
00:59:47,156 --> 00:59:48,823
There are even more here.

402
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:51,254
What do we do now?

403
00:59:52,096 --> 00:59:53,763
There's no way around it.

404
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,030
Let's go.

405
00:59:56,054 --> 00:59:58,054
NO SUBS FOR 2 Minutes

406
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,740
SUBS AVAILABLE NOW

407
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,365
Get that out of my face.

408
01:02:10,186 --> 01:02:11,186
Yo, douche.

409
01:02:13,071 --> 01:02:16,821
Felt good to see your kid thanks to me?

410
01:02:17,259 --> 01:02:18,950
Are you grateful or what?

411
01:02:19,886 --> 01:02:21,886
Why is your ringtone so tacky?

412
01:02:23,226 --> 01:02:24,626
What's wrong with it?

413
01:02:27,046 --> 01:02:28,313
How do i change it?

414
01:02:30,422 --> 01:02:34,399
Am i funny? You little rat?

415
01:02:35,675 --> 01:02:36,809
How tall are you?

416
01:02:37,082 --> 01:02:38,082
181cm.

417
01:02:39,104 --> 01:02:41,423
10km away, at 300km/h...

418
01:02:41,896 --> 01:02:42,896
What?

419
01:02:44,811 --> 01:02:49,152
2 minutes, upcoming tunnel
will give us 2 minutes.

420
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:51,233
- Can we do it? - We gotta.

421
01:02:52,536 --> 01:02:57,243
If we miss this one,
there's another in 3km...

422
01:02:57,243 --> 01:03:00,765
I bet you never get to
play with your daughter.

423
01:03:03,276 --> 01:03:04,609
When she gets older,

424
01:03:06,498 --> 01:03:09,098
she'll understand why you work so hard.

425
01:03:11,604 --> 01:03:14,433
Dads get all the bad rap and no praise,

426
01:03:15,236 --> 01:03:17,636
but it's all about sacrifice, right?

427
01:03:21,075 --> 01:03:24,287
What's with the look? Did I sound cool?

428
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,700
<i>People rescued. Heading over now.</i>

429
01:03:35,951 --> 01:03:37,551
My friend's coming here!

430
01:03:39,342 --> 01:03:40,219
What did you say?

431
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:40,342
My friend from another car is coming over.
What did you say?

432
01:03:40,342 --> 01:03:43,019
My friend from another car is coming over.

433
01:03:43,592 --> 01:03:45,459
- Who's coming? - My friend!

434
01:03:46,049 --> 01:03:49,384
He was in car 9, and he
rescued some people.

435
01:03:49,862 --> 01:03:50,862
Rescued?

436
01:03:52,756 --> 01:03:57,098
From there to here, passing
through those monsters?

437
01:03:58,015 --> 01:03:59,415
Without any injuries?

438
01:04:01,269 --> 01:04:03,269
You sure they're not infected?

439
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:06,551
Are you damn sure?!

440
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:09,534
What do you mean?

441
01:04:09,963 --> 01:04:12,779
Look, look at them.

442
01:04:13,778 --> 01:04:15,245
At a moment like this,

443
01:04:15,454 --> 01:04:19,836
no one knows what happened
to their families.

444
01:04:20,843 --> 01:04:25,372
We don't even know if your
damn friends are infected!

445
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,494
But allow them in here?!

446
01:04:33,515 --> 01:04:34,915
I don't believe this.

447
01:04:44,382 --> 01:04:45,382
Sir,

448
01:04:47,239 --> 01:04:50,080
please say something.

449
01:04:51,163 --> 01:04:52,563
They'll be here soon.

450
01:04:55,093 --> 01:04:56,093
Sir!

451
01:08:44,826 --> 01:08:45,826
Get over here.

452
01:08:54,877 --> 01:08:55,877
One!

453
01:08:58,227 --> 01:08:59,227
Two!

454
01:09:06,281 --> 01:09:07,281
Run!

455
01:09:20,453 --> 01:09:21,587
Jin-hee! Jin-hee!

456
01:09:24,931 --> 01:09:26,131
Hurry the hell up!

457
01:09:35,948 --> 01:09:36,948
Open up!

458
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:40,862
Hey! Open this door!

459
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:43,944
Jin-hee!

460
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,040
Open this door!

461
01:10:01,223 --> 01:10:03,953
- Open up! - Jin-hee, Jin-hee

462
01:10:14,225 --> 01:10:15,973
Open it now!

463
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:18,110
It wont budge!

464
01:10:18,378 --> 01:10:19,378
It can't open it!

465
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:20,650
Smash it!

466
01:10:21,732 --> 01:10:22,732
Stand back!

467
01:10:29,354 --> 01:10:30,354
Hurry up!

468
01:10:35,366 --> 01:10:36,366
Dammit...

469
01:11:01,022 --> 01:11:02,222
You stupid idiots!

470
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:16,900
Come on!

471
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,410
In-gil!

472
01:11:35,372 --> 01:11:36,372
Young-guk!

473
01:11:40,086 --> 01:11:41,072
Stand back!

474
01:11:41,072 --> 01:11:41,086
Young-guk!
Stand back!

475
01:11:41,086 --> 01:11:42,072
Young-guk!

476
01:12:16,856 --> 01:12:17,856
Stay away!

477
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:28,657
Stay back, baby. Please go!

478
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:36,650
Buddy, hey!

479
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:40,022
Take her and leave.

480
01:12:41,049 --> 01:12:42,822
You have to go!

481
01:12:44,562 --> 01:12:45,762
I said go, douche!

482
01:12:47,914 --> 01:12:49,847
I'm getting tired, please go.

483
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:56,644
Take care of her, okay?

484
01:12:58,569 --> 01:13:01,629
I'll hold them off, just go!

485
01:13:11,629 --> 01:13:14,129
I'm sorry...

486
01:13:24,995 --> 01:13:26,995
We have to go, let's go!

487
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,010
Yoon Su-yun!

488
01:13:32,611 --> 01:13:33,678
Our baby's name!

489
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,720
Got it?

490
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:38,207
Why did you do it?!

491
01:15:40,811 --> 01:15:41,811
You bastard!

492
01:15:43,949 --> 01:15:45,416
We could've save them!

493
01:15:48,115 --> 01:15:49,115
Why?!

494
01:15:50,287 --> 01:15:51,287
He's infected!

495
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:54,896
He's one of them!

496
01:15:55,761 --> 01:15:57,094
This guy's infected!

497
01:15:57,603 --> 01:15:59,403
His eyes! Look at his eyes!

498
01:16:00,008 --> 01:16:01,675
He'll become one of them!

499
01:16:02,193 --> 01:16:03,793
Do you all want to die?!

500
01:16:04,177 --> 01:16:05,710
We must throw them out!

501
01:16:16,097 --> 01:16:19,280
Those of you who just arrived,

502
01:16:20,292 --> 01:16:22,625
I don't think you can stay with us.

503
01:16:24,718 --> 01:16:26,651
Please move to the vestibule.

504
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:42,797
Just go!

505
01:16:47,621 --> 01:16:48,621
Get out!

506
01:16:54,231 --> 01:16:55,231
Get out now!

507
01:16:58,846 --> 01:16:59,846
Hurry up!

508
01:17:01,221 --> 01:17:02,221
Move!

509
01:17:04,005 --> 01:17:05,005
Go!

510
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:06,401
Leave us!

511
01:17:08,565 --> 01:17:09,698
Get the hell out!

512
01:17:11,698 --> 01:17:12,698
Out now!

513
01:17:14,503 --> 01:17:15,503
Hurry!

514
01:17:19,655 --> 01:17:22,155
It'll be safer for you to stay here.

515
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:25,211
No, I don't want to stay.

516
01:17:26,812 --> 01:17:27,961
I'm coming with you.

517
01:17:28,066 --> 01:17:29,066
But...

518
01:17:29,405 --> 01:17:30,538
Get the hell out!

519
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,929
What are you waiting for!

520
01:17:33,942 --> 01:17:34,942
Okay, let's go.

521
01:17:37,882 --> 01:17:39,846
Get out! Rest of you!

522
01:17:40,678 --> 01:17:41,678
Get out!

523
01:17:42,406 --> 01:17:43,472
Get out of here!

524
01:18:02,203 --> 01:18:03,203
Let's go.

525
01:18:40,913 --> 01:18:41,913
Tie it faster!

526
01:18:43,357 --> 01:18:44,461
More ties! Neckties!

527
01:18:44,461 --> 01:18:44,690
Shut up! I'm working on it!
More ties! Neckties!

528
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:46,261
Shut up! I'm working on it!

529
01:19:03,045 --> 01:19:04,045
Yun In-gil

530
01:19:04,872 --> 01:19:05,872
Great name.

531
01:19:07,685 --> 01:19:11,330
Always helping others instead of yourself.

532
01:19:15,178 --> 01:19:17,527
Why did you live like that?

533
01:19:19,491 --> 01:19:21,491
What was the point?

534
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:23,850
So stupid...

535
01:19:31,711 --> 01:19:32,911
Shut up! Be quiet!

536
01:19:34,263 --> 01:19:35,463
Stay in your seat!

537
01:19:36,683 --> 01:19:38,683
What a load of shit.

538
01:19:43,775 --> 01:19:46,175
Finish up and do the other side too.

539
01:19:57,271 --> 01:20:01,046
Thank you for everyting.

540
01:20:02,611 --> 01:20:03,566
That woman...

541
01:20:03,566 --> 01:20:03,611
Stop her!
That woman...

542
01:20:03,611 --> 01:20:04,566
Stop her!

543
01:20:59,127 --> 01:21:01,628
Control, this is Busan-bound 101!

544
01:21:01,628 --> 01:21:04,561
Requesting current
situation in Busan, over.

545
01:21:05,377 --> 01:21:06,377
Control?!

546
01:21:07,127 --> 01:21:08,127
Control!

547
01:22:35,067 --> 01:22:36,467
It's your birthday...

548
01:22:41,157 --> 01:22:42,157
Don't worry.

549
01:22:43,273 --> 01:22:45,673
I'll take you to mom no matter what.

550
01:22:49,306 --> 01:22:50,823
Aren't you scared?

551
01:22:56,839 --> 01:22:57,865
Of course I am.

552
01:23:00,153 --> 01:23:01,153
I'm scared too.

553
01:23:06,316 --> 01:23:07,383
I was so scared.

554
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:11,546
I thought I'd never see you again.

555
01:23:14,427 --> 01:23:18,672
I practiced that song just for you.

556
01:23:23,737 --> 01:23:25,537
That's why I couldn't sing.

557
01:23:28,093 --> 01:23:29,760
Because I didn't see you.

558
01:23:36,862 --> 01:23:39,337
Will you stay with me?

559
01:23:55,436 --> 01:23:56,436
<i>Ex-wife</i>

560
01:24:07,938 --> 01:24:11,154
<i>The person you're calling is not available</i>

561
01:24:22,746 --> 01:24:23,746
<i>Analyst Kim</i>

562
01:24:28,094 --> 01:24:29,094
Yes, Kim.

563
01:24:31,568 --> 01:24:33,301
<i>Have you arrived in Busan?</i>

564
01:24:33,345 --> 01:24:36,078
Not yet, where are you? Is it okay there?

565
01:24:37,924 --> 01:24:40,257
<i>Busan succeeded in initial defense.</i>

566
01:24:41,048 --> 01:24:42,181
What? You sure?

567
01:24:42,205 --> 01:24:44,205
NO SUBS For 1 minute

568
01:25:10,122 --> 01:25:12,122
SUBS AVAILABLE NOW

569
01:25:12,147 --> 01:25:13,647
<i>Is this my fault?</i>

570
01:25:17,805 --> 01:25:18,805
It's...

571
01:25:19,965 --> 01:25:21,298
It's not your fault.

572
01:25:25,192 --> 01:25:26,192
<i>Thank you...</i>

573
01:25:28,692 --> 01:25:29,692
Kim...

574
01:27:14,824 --> 01:27:15,957
<i>Attention please.</i>

575
01:27:17,044 --> 01:27:20,475
<i>Due to a blockage on our track,</i>

576
01:27:21,179 --> 01:27:23,209
<i>we have stopped at East Daegu Station.</i>

577
01:27:23,347 --> 01:27:26,847
<i>We should either wait for the rescue team,</i>

578
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:31,804
<i>or we'll have to reach
Busan in another train.</i>

579
01:27:32,994 --> 01:27:34,702
<i>As soon as I end this announcement,</i>

580
01:27:35,002 --> 01:27:40,591
<i>I will find a working train and
put it on left most track.</i>

581
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:41,527
What's going on?

582
01:27:41,527 --> 01:27:41,922
<i>I repeat, left most track.</i>
What's going on?

583
01:27:41,922 --> 01:27:43,876
<i>I repeat, left most track.</i>

584
01:27:44,473 --> 01:27:48,987
If you're alive, please transfer safely.

585
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:51,820
Godspeed.

586
01:28:58,228 --> 01:28:59,761
Will there be a rescue?

587
01:29:02,907 --> 01:29:04,707
I heard that Busan is safe.

588
01:29:07,561 --> 01:29:08,894
We have to move now.

589
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

590
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:55,248
Coast clear?

591
01:30:57,951 --> 01:30:58,951
Yeah.

592
01:31:02,269 --> 01:31:03,269
You go ahead.

593
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:30,193
We've got to find a way across.

594
01:31:54,037 --> 01:31:55,037
What in the...

595
01:32:07,352 --> 01:32:08,352
Over here!

596
01:32:45,562 --> 01:32:46,562
No...

597
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:47,708
Oh no...

598
01:32:50,150 --> 01:32:51,150
What now...

599
01:32:52,646 --> 01:32:54,313
We have to move, come on!

600
01:33:03,042 --> 01:33:04,242
Jin-hee, let's go!

601
01:33:20,694 --> 01:33:21,694
Stand back!

602
01:33:34,671 --> 01:33:35,671
Jin-hee!

603
01:33:50,273 --> 01:33:51,273
Jin-hee!

604
01:34:03,084 --> 01:34:04,151
This can't be...

605
01:34:10,059 --> 01:34:11,059
I'm sorry...

606
01:34:35,573 --> 01:34:42,767
Daddy! Wake up!

607
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:49,477
Daddy! Daddy!

608
01:35:05,267 --> 01:35:06,334
What's going on?

609
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:12,354
Come on faster! Faster!

610
01:35:20,321 --> 01:35:21,321
Dammit!

611
01:35:38,211 --> 01:35:39,211
Help!

612
01:36:22,827 --> 01:36:24,093
Sweetie, come here!

613
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:29,950
Su-an, Su-an!

614
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,104
Mister!

615
01:37:06,648 --> 01:37:07,648
Sweetie!

616
01:37:07,813 --> 01:37:08,946
Su-an, come here!

617
01:37:10,068 --> 01:37:10,624
Mister...

618
01:37:10,624 --> 01:37:11,068
Go! Hurry!
Mister...

619
01:37:11,068 --> 01:37:12,625
Go! Hurry!

620
01:37:13,674 --> 01:37:14,674
Come on!

621
01:37:14,748 --> 01:37:15,748
Hurry!

622
01:37:38,604 --> 01:37:39,604
Let's go!

623
01:39:03,328 --> 01:39:04,328
Hurry! Hurry!

624
01:39:07,823 --> 01:39:08,823
Daddy!

625
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Here is the throttle, the brakes

626
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

627
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I see something

628
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Approaching 2 subjects at our location.
Looks like a woman and a child.

629
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
<i>Are you able to verify the subjects?</i><i></i>

630
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Its so dark on the other side

631
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I can't clearly see them

632
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Cant clearly see the subjects, unable to verify.

633
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
<i>Kill them.</i><i></i>

634
01:52:33,000 --> 01:53:01,000
<i>(CHILD SINGING)</i><i></i>

635
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
2 survivors approaching

636
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
THE END
