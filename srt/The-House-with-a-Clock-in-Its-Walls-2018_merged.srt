00:01:00,578 --> 00:01:02,478
<i>Dear Lewis:</i>

3
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,513
<i>Enclosed, please find
one bus ticket</i>

4
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:07,650
<i>and two silver dollars
for your trip to Michigan.</i>

5
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:11,387
<i>I'm really sorry about the loss
of your parents.</i>

6
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:15,458
<i>Your mom was my sister,
so that makes you family.</i>

7
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,561
<i>And I'll do my best to make you
feel right at home.</i>

8
00:01:18,563 --> 00:01:22,431
<i>As Einstein said,
life is like a bicycle.</i>

9
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:25,634
<i>To stay balanced,
you got to keep moving forward.</i>

10
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:27,436
<i>And so will we.</i>

11
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:29,472
<i>I look forward to meeting you.</i>

12
00:01:29,474 --> 00:01:31,440
<i>Your Uncle Jonathan.</i>

13
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:33,375
<i>P.S. Sorry for the stain
on the letter.</i>

14
00:01:33,377 --> 00:01:35,778
<i>That's chocolate.</i>

15
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:41,917
Mom, Dad, are you there?

16
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:44,255
Am I gonna be okay?

17
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:50,559
"Cannot say."

18
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,771
Gonna buy Charlie
a bike for his birthday.

19
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:04,540
Oh, he's gonna love it.

20
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,709
Emma Jean, bus is here.

21
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:12,715
Last stop: New Zebedee.

22
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:43,412
Oh, come on.

23
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:45,681
Don't kill yourself before
I've had a chance to meet you.

24
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:47,616
Lewis?

25
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:49,453
I'm your Uncle Jonathan.

26
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:52,588
Are you wearing a robe?

27
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,423
It's a kimono.

28
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:55,858
Oh.

29
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,794
Here, let me help you
with that.

30
00:02:58,796 --> 00:03:01,797
Oh! Good Lord, what do you got
in this thing, encyclopedias?

31
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:02,865
Dictionaries.

32
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:07,403
Oh, you're serious.

33
00:03:07,405 --> 00:03:08,838
I like new words.

34
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,606
I think they're very
pulchritudinous.

35
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,474
Well, welcome to New Zebedee.

36
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:13,943
Or should I say "salutations"?

37
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,744
You can look that one up.

38
00:03:15,746 --> 00:03:17,613
I know what
"salutations" means.

39
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,617
Oh. Smart kid.

40
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:23,419
Uh, do you think
that we're gonna be home soon?

41
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:25,187
'Cause the <i>Captain Midnight</i>
show's almost on.

42
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:27,623
Uh, you don't have to worry
about that. I don't have a TV.

43
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,025
But I do have a big poker game
tonight, if you want to join.

44
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:31,560
Do you play?

45
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:32,995
Uh, no. I'm ten.

46
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:34,864
Duly noted.

47
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:55,050
Ah. Here we are.

48
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:57,519
Excuse me.

49
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:59,788
The Muggins Simoon.

50
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,790
Temperamental door handle.

51
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,427
Hop in.

52
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:05,661
Here we go.

53
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,565
Watch your tootsies.

54
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:13,437
All right, here we are.

55
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,473
You can get out here.

56
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:18,674
Here we go.

57
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:35,557
Home, sweet home.

58
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:39,061
Do you like...

59
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:40,863
- Halloween?
- Hmm?

60
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:42,733
Oh, no, I keep those up
year round.

61
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,981
Mr. Barnavelt!

62
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,649
Come on, darling.

63
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,018
Yes. Good puppy.

64
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,652
Mr. Barnavelt!

65
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,055
Ah, Mrs. Hanchett.

66
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:23,622
Marmalade.

67
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:24,990
Is that a robe?

68
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,792
It's a kimono.

69
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:29,162
You've been playing
your saxophone again.

70
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:31,764
Madame, not everyone
can appreciate the intricacies

71
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,665
of a free-form jazz odyssey.

72
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,035
I don't care what you play.

73
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:36,835
You're playing at 3:00
in the morning,

74
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,138
so I'm begging you...
Who is this?

75
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,041
Oh, this is Lewis, my nephew.

76
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:42,741
He'll be living with me.

77
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:43,942
You're responsible

78
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,944
for keeping
a human child alive?

79
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,679
That's right.

80
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,781
Good evening.

81
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:50,183
This way, Lewis.

82
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:52,017
I'll try to keep it down

83
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,953
around 3:00 a.m., but, uh...

84
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,958
them's my best jammin' hours.

85
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:03,597
And here we are.

86
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:22,950
Wow. You've...

87
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,119
That's a lot of clocks.

88
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:27,719
Well, what constitutes "a lot"

89
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,222
is really a matter
of personal taste.

90
00:06:29,224 --> 00:06:31,124
For me, it's a perfect amount
of clocks.

91
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:34,793
Oh, sorry.

92
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,164
There's a deranged cuckoo
in there.

93
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,232
Your ratchet wheel's shot,

94
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:42,104
and the click spring's
not far behind.

95
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,871
Hello. You're Lewis, I presume.

96
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,706
How was your trip?

97
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,075
This old hag
is my next-door neighbor,

98
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:50,943
Mrs. Florence Zimmerman.

99
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:53,745
I am relieved to see
you didn't inherit your uncle's

100
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,149
- freakishly oversized head.
- Huh.

101
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:58,151
Says the woman who literally
looks like a Q-tip.

102
00:06:58,153 --> 00:07:01,254
Oh, look,
the giant head is angry.

103
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:03,156
My God, did that withered

104
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:04,890
purple skeleton just speak?

105
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,026
It's nice to meet you.

106
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:08,827
- Lewis, are you hungry?
- Yes, please.

107
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,762
Florence, I'm gonna
show Lewis to his room.

108
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,031
For once in your life,
could you

109
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,832
make yourself useful
and whip up a batch

110
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,135
of those chocolate chip
cookies?

111
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:16,768
And how would you
like them, sir?

112
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,704
Stuffed down your throat
one by one

113
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:21,006
or crumbled up
and shoved into your pants?

114
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,076
Ignore her, Lewis. She thinks
she's smarter than me

115
00:07:23,078 --> 00:07:25,145
because she's got more
college degrees.

116
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:26,778
No, I think I'm smarter
than you

117
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,779
because I'm smarter than you.

118
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:30,183
Shh!

119
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:31,783
But, Uncle Jonathan?

120
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,186
- Hmm?
- Don't I have to have dinner

121
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:34,786
before I'm allowed
to have cookies?

122
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,222
Well, why not just
eat cookies for dinner?

123
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:37,990
They're far more delicious.

124
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:40,126
I know. It's just,
we had these house rules.

125
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,827
Well, not in this house.

126
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,230
There's no bedtime,
bath time or mealtime.

127
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:47,133
You can eat cookies till you
throw up, for all I care.

128
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:50,069
You'll see... things are...

129
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,805
quite different here.

130
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:19,301
- All mine?
- All yours.

131
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,169
Although, why this is yours,
I have no idea.

132
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:24,937
You know it's about
the complete opposite

133
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,372
of real magic.

134
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:29,309
Well, it's the last thing
my parents gave to me

135
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:31,877
before the...

136
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,115
...the car crash.

137
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,217
I'm... sorry.

138
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:38,817
Uh, here.

139
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,253
Yeah, take that back.

140
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:43,122
Um, I have a tissue...

141
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:45,124
around here somewhere.

142
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:46,261
Ah.

143
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:51,397
Here you go. No, hold on.

144
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,367
Sorry. I didn't mean to, uh...

145
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:58,870
I didn't realize the ball
was of emotional significance.

146
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,273
Almost there.

147
00:09:02,077 --> 00:09:03,875
Feel free to grab
any color tissue.

148
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,245
They're all the same.

149
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:06,979
Hey, gorilla groin.

150
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,048
Are we playing poker,
or am I playing solitaire?

151
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,016
Hold your horses,
you scarecrow.

152
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,054
Right?

153
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:21,994
Calling that a poker face
is an insult to faces.

154
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:27,768
Sore loser, frumpy.

155
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:32,372
Well, beat that.

156
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:41,614
Ugh.

157
00:09:41,616 --> 00:09:44,183
- He wins... again.
- You're hustling me.

158
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:46,152
You've played before.

159
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:47,919
I haven't.

160
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,455
I swear.

161
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:51,890
Beginner's luck, I guess?

162
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,060
Well, I'm gonna drown
my sorrows in some hot cocoa.

163
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:55,161
- You want some?
- Yes, please.

164
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:56,329
- Florence?
- Delighted.

165
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:58,266
- Get your own.
- Choke and die.

166
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:03,136
So, how long have you lived
next door to Uncle Jonathan?

167
00:10:03,138 --> 00:10:05,338
Oh, we've been friends forever,
ever since I came here.

168
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,340
Ran here, actually.

169
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:09,342
From Paris.

170
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:11,112
After the war.

171
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:18,351
And no, to answer that look
you're giving me,

172
00:10:18,353 --> 00:10:21,154
your uncle and I
aren't anything kissy-faced.

173
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:22,655
- Gross!
- Ugh.

174
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:24,090
The word's "platonic."

175
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:26,292
That's right.

176
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:29,362
Look, your uncle
drives me nuts.

177
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:31,297
And he doesn't always smell
so terrific,

178
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:34,100
but he's gotten me out
of more tough scrapes

179
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:35,934
than I care to mention.

180
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:39,472
You know, I've found
that all one really needs

181
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:42,210
in this world
is one good friend.

182
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:46,079
Oh, but I'm sure
you've got lots.

183
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:47,413
Yeah.

184
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:49,215
Tons.

185
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:51,983
All my friends are...
really great.

186
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,854
Hmm.

187
00:10:57,692 --> 00:11:00,992
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.

188
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,929
I really miss you guys.

189
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,398
Love you.

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

191
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,498
Uh, Uncle Jonathan?

192
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,201
You've got to go
into the wall.

193
00:12:48,203 --> 00:12:50,102
I am going in the wall.

194
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,337
You did not go into the wall
yesterday.

195
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:53,473
- I saw you. You did not go into...
- Hello?

196
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:55,074
Lewis, didn't see you there.

197
00:12:55,076 --> 00:12:56,375
Big day. First day of school.

198
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:58,444
- How'd you sleep?
- Uh... fine.

199
00:12:58,446 --> 00:12:59,812
How did you sleep?

200
00:12:59,814 --> 00:13:01,113
Peachy. Like a baby.

201
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,381
Like a big, peachy baby.

202
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,383
Okay, off you go.
Knock 'em dead.

203
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,253
I played it perfect.

204
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:09,489
He suspects nothing.

205
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:12,494
43rd New
Zebedee Blue Ribbon Bake-Off...

206
00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:28,543
Hold the door!

207
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:36,985
Clark, let's make a decision.

208
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,492
Herman.

209
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,174
Good hustle, Herman.

210
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,609
Thanks, Coach.

211
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:08,548
Woody.

212
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,449
We're even teams now.

213
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:12,285
Let's play ball.

214
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:13,586
Maybe next time, ankle biter.

215
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:15,121
Coach.

216
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:16,355
Come on, just pick him.

217
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,591
- No. No.
- Just pick him.

218
00:14:18,593 --> 00:14:20,126
Come on.

219
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:22,395
Fine. All right.

220
00:14:22,397 --> 00:14:23,462
You're with us.

221
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:24,566
You can play, right?

222
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:28,236
S-Sure.

223
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,538
I'm open! I'm...

224
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,307
Goggles, get up!
Come on, guys!

225
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:35,474
Down the court, down the court!

226
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:36,709
You all right?

227
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:39,612
- You good?
- Open your space up.

228
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:41,347
Come on, guys.
Open the space.

229
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:43,215
All right, get it.
Let's go, go, go!

230
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,550
Pass the ball!

231
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:46,385
- Goggles, what's going on?
- Come on!

232
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:47,420
Come on, let's go!

233
00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:49,255
Defense, look alive!
Come on, look alive, guys!

234
00:14:49,257 --> 00:14:50,356
- Shoot it!
- Goggles, make the shot!

235
00:14:50,358 --> 00:14:51,624
- Come on! Make a shot!
- Oh!

236
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:53,693
Make a...
Not at me. The basket.

237
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,428
- Pass the ball!
- You gotta pass the ball, Goggles!

238
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,596
Goggles! Goggles, I'm open!

239
00:14:56,598 --> 00:14:58,230
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:02,368
Guard your guys.
Guard your guys. Let's go.

241
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,603
- I'm open!
- Shoot!

242
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:05,106
- Shoot!
- Shoot!

243
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,676
- Nice shot, speedy.
- Thanks, Coach.

244
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:12,278
Attention, students.

245
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,681
Hi!

246
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:18,384
There he is... star forward
for the Minneapolis Lakers.

247
00:15:18,386 --> 00:15:19,952
- How you doing, buddy?
- I'm good.

248
00:15:19,954 --> 00:15:22,221
A vote for Tarby Corrigan
is a vote for pop

249
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:23,589
- in the drinking fountains.
- Thank you.

250
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:25,791
Hey. A vote for Tarby Corrigan
is a vote for pop

251
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:27,493
- in the drinking fountains.
- Please.

252
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:29,362
How is he gonna carbonate
the drinking fountains?

253
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:43,476
Whoa.

254
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,812
Don't just stand there.

255
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:49,248
- Can you pitch?
- Uh...

256
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,484
no, not very well.

257
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:53,786
I'll take what I can get.

258
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:55,289
Come toss me one.

259
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:57,759
Come on.

260
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,000
What are you doing here?

261
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:09,769
Where are all your friends?

262
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:11,370
Football practice.

263
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:13,572
Can't play.
Can't do anything.

264
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:16,544
My butt is just
warming the bench.

265
00:16:18,713 --> 00:16:21,380
So, you're new in town.

266
00:16:21,382 --> 00:16:23,349
- Where do you live?
- Kind of this big,

267
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:25,186
old place on the end
of High Street.

268
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:27,720
Wait.

269
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:29,822
You... you live
in the slaughterhouse?

270
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:31,524
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:31,526 --> 00:16:32,725
The what?

272
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:34,326
Some old guy died there.

273
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,695
Now it's haunted.

274
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:36,829
Well, everyone says so.

275
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:38,364
Have you seen anything creepy?

276
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:39,732
No.

277
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:41,834
Well, last night,
I thought I heard something,

278
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:44,403
but it wasn't anything;
it was just my uncle.

279
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:45,404
What was he doing?

280
00:16:45,406 --> 00:16:47,673
I don't know.
Just sort of wandering around.

281
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:49,575
I think he was looking
for something.

282
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:51,544
Maybe he was looking for an ax.

283
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:53,345
It's his house.

284
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,347
Why wouldn't he know
where his own ax is?

285
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:58,286
Maybe he hid it from the police
after the last murder.

286
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:02,588
Look, I'm just trying
to help us both out.

287
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,359
You can't vote for me
if you don't have arms.

288
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:08,663
Come on.

289
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:22,410
Lewis.

290
00:17:24,345 --> 00:17:25,680
Lewis.

291
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:30,750
Lewis.

292
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,618
Sweetheart.

293
00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:35,621
Hey, kiddo.

294
00:17:35,623 --> 00:17:37,658
I missed you so much.

295
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:42,595
I miss you, too, Mom.
A lot.

296
00:17:42,597 --> 00:17:46,432
Your dad and I,
we'd give anything

297
00:17:46,434 --> 00:17:48,101
to be with you again.

298
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:50,736
You know that, right?

299
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,571
So...

300
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,673
how are you making out?

301
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:56,542
How do you like Uncle Jonathan?

302
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:58,410
He seems nice.

303
00:17:58,412 --> 00:17:59,814
Just...

304
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:02,548
What?

305
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,916
Hey.

306
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,452
It's okay. You can tell me.

307
00:18:06,454 --> 00:18:09,421
This house is scary.
And-and old and scary.

308
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,690
And there's all these clocks,
and I see weird stuff

309
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,559
out of the corner of my eye,
and...

310
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:16,395
I feel like...
I almost feel like

311
00:18:16,397 --> 00:18:18,430
that Uncle Jonathan's
hiding something.

312
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:21,433
That's because he is...

313
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:23,404
hiding something.

314
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:25,573
From you.

315
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:28,808
I'm sorry, sweetheart,

316
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,975
but you're in danger.

317
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:31,944
Danger? Wh...

318
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:33,546
What danger? What do you mean?

319
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:36,149
You're gonna have to be brave.

320
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:37,917
But I... But, Mom, this is me.

321
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,418
I'm not brave.

322
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:47,560
First, you get the book.

323
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:49,528
Then you get the key.

324
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,697
Book.

325
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:53,601
K-Key...
What are you talking about?

326
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:00,539
Do you hear the ticking?

327
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:35,507
Brave.

328
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,845
Brave. Brave.

329
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:01,961
Come out, come out,

330
00:21:01,963 --> 00:21:03,764
wherever you are.

331
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:07,700
You can't hide forever.

332
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:31,757
Help!

333
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:28,847
Help! Let me out!

334
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,083
Help, please!

335
00:22:30,085 --> 00:22:31,683
Help me! Let me out!

336
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,054
It's me.

337
00:22:34,056 --> 00:22:35,888
Down, boy!

338
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,057
I said down.

339
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,690
Go. Go on, go to your room.

340
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:39,892
Go on, get.

341
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:43,096
I'm sorry you had to see that.

342
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:44,696
No. No.

343
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:46,066
No, houses don't attack you.

344
00:22:46,068 --> 00:22:47,833
And if they do attack,
you're definitely not

345
00:22:47,835 --> 00:22:49,835
supposed to say,
"Sorry you had to see that."

346
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:51,071
Is this place haunted?

347
00:22:51,073 --> 00:22:53,639
- Are you gonna ax-murder me?
- What? No.

348
00:22:53,641 --> 00:22:54,973
You're gonna ax-murder me,
aren't you?

349
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:56,642
I'm not gonna ax-murder you.

350
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:57,978
Then what is going on?

351
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:00,679
Well, one thing's for sure.

352
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:02,048
The house likes you.

353
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,984
Houses don't like anything.
They're houses.

354
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,759
Do you know what
a warlock is, Lewis?

355
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,295
It's...

356
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:51,164
a boy witch.

357
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,032
Well...

358
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:56,735
I think they're a little more
than boy witches.

359
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:57,836
"Warlock.

360
00:23:57,838 --> 00:23:59,705
"Noun.

361
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:02,175
A man who practices magic."

362
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:03,878
A boy witch.

363
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:11,084
Are you saying that...
you're a warlock?

364
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:13,155
Would it scare you if I was?

365
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:20,226
Well, are you a good warlock
or a bad one?

366
00:24:20,228 --> 00:24:23,062
Ah. Depends on what
you mean by "bad."

367
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:26,199
I'm nice, but...
I'm not that good.

368
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:28,800
I'm just a parlor magician,
really, but, uh,

369
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:32,804
Mrs. Zimmerman, now,
she's nice <i>and</i> good.

370
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,174
Damn good.

371
00:24:34,176 --> 00:24:35,974
Got a Doctor Magicorum degree

372
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:38,044
from the University
of Göttingen.

373
00:24:38,046 --> 00:24:40,746
Why are you always
wandering around at night?

374
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:42,182
What is that ticking
in the walls?

375
00:24:42,184 --> 00:24:43,851
You've heard that?

376
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:50,223
This house used to be owned
by another warlock,

377
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:54,093
Isaac Izard,
and his wife Selena.

378
00:24:54,095 --> 00:24:55,994
He, uh...

379
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,330
passed away

380
00:24:57,332 --> 00:25:00,200
and left a magic clock
in the walls.

381
00:25:00,202 --> 00:25:01,301
Why?

382
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:03,171
Because he's a terrible...

383
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,838
Joker.

384
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,840
He's a practical joker.

385
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,177
Put a clock in the walls
to drive me nuts.

386
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:13,379
I try to drown it out
with all those other clocks,

387
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,114
but it doesn't really work,

388
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:16,982
so at night, I...

389
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:19,152
go around the house and...

390
00:25:19,154 --> 00:25:21,087
search for the damn thing.

391
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:22,257
With an ax?

392
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:27,229
Sometimes I get over-enthused.
I'll admit that.

393
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:34,866
Do you have to be born
a boy wi...

394
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:36,269
a warlock?

395
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:38,204
No. Anyone can learn.

396
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:40,240
If they study,
practice hard enough.

397
00:25:40,242 --> 00:25:42,342
- Can I learn?
- No.

398
00:25:42,344 --> 00:25:44,009
- But you just said "anyone."
- Grown-up anyone.

399
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:45,411
There's charts and hieroglyphs

400
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:47,313
and stuff that would stump
a Harvard professor,

401
00:25:47,315 --> 00:25:49,148
- and I don't have time to teach a...
- Please.

402
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:52,252
Please, please teach me.
Please, please,

403
00:25:52,254 --> 00:25:54,087
please, please, please.

404
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:56,824
Okay! Have it your way.

405
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:03,895
Oh.

406
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:17,176
Let me know
when you've read all those.

407
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:18,879
Just for a start.

408
00:26:32,294 --> 00:26:34,227
- Jack-o-lanterns.
- They scare away evil.

409
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:35,894
And iron does, too.

410
00:26:35,896 --> 00:26:37,397
Well, it repels evil,
like bug spray.

411
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:39,299
And that is why we have
iron horseshoes,

412
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
and that's why cemetery gates
are made of iron.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
And how does one become
a full-fledged warlock?

413
00:26:46,207 --> 00:26:48,041
You have to defeat
an evil spirit

414
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:50,243
by using your own magic.

415
00:26:50,245 --> 00:26:52,347
That is absolutely right.

416
00:26:56,351 --> 00:26:58,386
What smells of rancid sulfur?

417
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,289
Bad kitty!

418
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,027
Am I gonna have to defeat
an evil spirit one day?

419
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:10,229
Oh, don't worry.
Not for a long, long time.

420
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:12,198
You're perfectly safe.

421
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:15,967
That's safe?

422
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,273
As long as it's fed.

423
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,476
It used to be Florence's
pet garter snake,

424
00:27:23,478 --> 00:27:25,078
William Snakespeare.

425
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,046
She tried to turn it purple.

426
00:27:27,048 --> 00:27:28,214
The spell backfired.

427
00:27:28,216 --> 00:27:29,449
Between you and me,

428
00:27:29,451 --> 00:27:31,384
most of her spells
backfire these days.

429
00:27:31,386 --> 00:27:33,086
- Why?
- Ah, you'll have to

430
00:27:33,088 --> 00:27:35,088
ask her that one yourself.

431
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,056
What's all that?

432
00:27:37,058 --> 00:27:41,127
Charms, hexes, wards, spells.

433
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:43,262
Evil can't come within 20 feet
of that cabinet,

434
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:45,264
much less open it.

435
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:47,068
What's in it?

436
00:27:48,436 --> 00:27:51,371
You know how I said
there were no rules?

437
00:27:51,373 --> 00:27:53,406
Actually, there's one rule.

438
00:27:53,408 --> 00:27:56,342
Don't open that cabinet. Ever.

439
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:59,112
Or I'll toss you out
on your ear.

440
00:27:59,114 --> 00:28:00,179
You understand?

441
00:28:01,716 --> 00:28:03,349
This is pretty much
the only thing

442
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:06,985
I'm serious about,
so I need to hear you say it.

443
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:09,190
I understand.

444
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
JONATHAN and FLORENCE
<i>Isaac!</i>
Isaac!
- Isaac, don't do this!
- Stop!

445
00:28:39,087 --> 00:28:40,586
Please! Isaac, don't do it!

446
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:43,258
Isaac!

447
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:47,226
Isaac, please!

448
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:57,205
Isaac.

449
00:29:04,312 --> 00:29:06,245
<i>The beginning...</i>

450
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:07,482
and the end.

451
00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:11,050
The alpha

452
00:29:11,052 --> 00:29:12,287
<i>and the omega.</i>

453
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:16,489
Do you hear the ticking?

454
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,131
Well, I have scoured
the crawl space.

455
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:27,366
I found a dead mouse, but...

456
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:29,204
no clock.

457
00:29:31,172 --> 00:29:33,139
You think reading that
for the millionth time

458
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:35,041
will turn up something new?

459
00:29:35,043 --> 00:29:36,476
No, not really.

460
00:29:36,478 --> 00:29:38,110
So...

461
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:40,146
you've told Lewis everything?

462
00:29:40,148 --> 00:29:42,048
Well, not everything.

463
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,517
I think you should.

464
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,386
Isaac may be dead,
but he is still dangerous.

465
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:49,522
- If Lewis knew the truth...
- Well, we don't know the truth.

466
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:51,257
We don't know
where the clock is

467
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:54,293
or what it does,
except something horrible.

468
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:57,063
No, we gotta do
the responsible thing:

469
00:29:57,065 --> 00:29:58,399
lie to the kid.

470
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,682
Hey, Lewis.

471
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:18,284
Hmm?

472
00:30:18,286 --> 00:30:19,652
Why do you wear those goggles?

473
00:30:19,654 --> 00:30:22,488
Captain Midnight wears a pair
just like these.

474
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,123
You ever seen his show?

475
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,324
He's indomitable.

476
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:27,159
He's what?

477
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,294
"Indomitable.

478
00:30:28,296 --> 00:30:31,097
Adjective.
Impossible to defeat."

479
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:32,465
That's what they call him.

480
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:34,435
The Indomitable
Captain Midnight.

481
00:30:36,104 --> 00:30:38,237
I just think it might be
easier for you if you...

482
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:39,505
lost the goggles.

483
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:42,875
Acted a little more...

484
00:30:42,877 --> 00:30:45,246
you know, normal.

485
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:48,381
Oh.

486
00:30:48,383 --> 00:30:50,449
You think?

487
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:53,021
I'm just telling you
as a friend.

488
00:30:55,123 --> 00:30:56,589
Right.

489
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:59,325
Friends. We're friends.

490
00:31:00,595 --> 00:31:02,194
Lewis!

491
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:05,631
Lewis!

492
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:07,600
Can't you see me?

493
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:09,468
Over here! Right here!

494
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,603
Lewis!

495
00:31:10,605 --> 00:31:12,605
It's your Uncle Johnny!

496
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:14,206
I should go.

497
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,708
Probably.

498
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,476
Come on! Let's go!

499
00:31:17,478 --> 00:31:19,312
Get in. Where's your goggles?

500
00:31:19,314 --> 00:31:20,580
What are you doing here?

501
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,915
Oh, we gotta get some supplies.

502
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,517
Got a harvest moon tonight.

503
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,552
- It's perfect.
- Perfect for what?

504
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:28,521
For your first big-time,
serious spell.

505
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:30,189
Should I punch it?

506
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:31,624
You won't believe
what this thing can do.

507
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:33,225
Can we just go, please?

508
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:34,627
Well, doggone, that moon

509
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:36,662
will be gone next week
with the lunar eclipse coming.

510
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:38,497
Till then, let's keep on rocking.

511
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:41,601
"From Saturn to the sun,

512
00:31:41,603 --> 00:31:44,337
"from the base to noble one,

513
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:46,505
"like the alchemist of old,

514
00:31:46,507 --> 00:31:50,576
turn this dross lead
into gold!"

515
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:52,645
Wow.

516
00:31:52,647 --> 00:31:54,647
That was really,

517
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:56,417
really...

518
00:31:57,619 --> 00:31:59,218
...terrible.

519
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,387
I mean, just awful.

520
00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:02,388
Hey.

521
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,523
You're reading it
like it's a Buick manual.

522
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:07,293
It's not what you say, Lewis.

523
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:09,395
It's how you say it.

524
00:32:09,397 --> 00:32:13,232
You're the only you
in the whole universe.

525
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:14,767
That makes your style of magic

526
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,702
just crazy unique.

527
00:32:16,704 --> 00:32:19,238
One in a hundred million
kajillion.

528
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,240
So I can give you
the right books,

529
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:23,976
teach you the right spells,
but that last one percent...

530
00:32:23,978 --> 00:32:25,346
that's up to you.

531
00:32:26,414 --> 00:32:28,414
So...

532
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:31,617
how do I find my magic style
or whatever it is?

533
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:33,653
It's in there somewhere.

534
00:32:33,655 --> 00:32:36,424
You just have to quiet down
and listen.

535
00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:42,461
Now it looks
like you're pooping.

536
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:43,729
Well, I don't know!

537
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:45,431
This all feels weird.

538
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:47,333
What's wrong with weird?

539
00:32:47,335 --> 00:32:49,268
Weird's like the nuts
in my cookies.

540
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,704
It's the nuts
that make things interesting.

541
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:55,007
Let me show you
what a little weird can do.

542
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:08,454
Be a dear.

543
00:33:08,456 --> 00:33:10,723
Fetch a knife
and stab me in the ears.

544
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:12,752
Well, for a boy
who loves words,

545
00:34:12,754 --> 00:34:15,788
you're sure at a loss for them.

546
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,823
Uncle Jonathan?

547
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:21,395
You're way more than just
a parlor magician.

548
00:34:23,498 --> 00:34:25,397
Have a look around.

549
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

550
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:11,977
Finally.

551
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:13,579
A smile.

552
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:16,450
I was starting to think
you were incapable.

553
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:22,421
Bad kitty!

554
00:35:22,423 --> 00:35:23,689
You use the litter box!

555
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:27,993
All right.
I'm going to bed.

556
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:31,497
You're welcome to stay up
as long as you like, of course.

557
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:32,565
Uncle Jonathan?

558
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:34,466
- Hmm?
- Tonight,

559
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:35,868
that was the most splendor...

560
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,570
s-splendortas...

561
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:40,606
splendorific...

562
00:35:40,608 --> 00:35:42,944
I don't know the word yet,
but thank you.

563
00:35:45,813 --> 00:35:48,848
I just wish that I met you
a long time ago.

564
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,883
Yeah. Me, too.

565
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:52,718
Good night.

566
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,622
Why didn't I?

567
00:35:55,923 --> 00:35:57,857
How come you left home?

568
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,493
Well...

569
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:05,031
truth is, my father...
your grandpa...

570
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:06,866
didn't like magic.

571
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:09,568
And he sure didn't like me
messing around with it.

572
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,772
We fought about it,
and we fought some more

573
00:36:13,774 --> 00:36:15,941
until finally I just...

574
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:17,478
took off.

575
00:36:19,047 --> 00:36:21,582
I was the black swan
of the family.

576
00:36:22,984 --> 00:36:25,651
It's "black sheep."

577
00:36:25,653 --> 00:36:29,622
Mmm... pretty sure it's "swan."

578
00:36:29,624 --> 00:36:33,527
Is that why you didn't go
to Mom and Dad's funeral?

579
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:39,700
I don't really think
she would have wanted me there.

580
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,669
I don't know.

581
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:44,739
She missed you.

582
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:47,875
She talked about you
all the time.

583
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:54,749
Uh, good night.

584
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:00,755
Uncle Jonathan?

585
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:03,622
I think...

586
00:37:03,624 --> 00:37:06,627
I think that I might be
a black swan, too.

587
00:37:08,963 --> 00:37:11,832
Well, then I guess
we're a flock of swans.

588
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,533
A bevy.

589
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:16,069
It's called "a bevy of swans."

590
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:17,970
Right.

591
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:55,041
Whoa!

592
00:37:55,043 --> 00:37:57,077
Guys! Guys! I'm floating.

593
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,011
- Oh, uh, uh...
- I don't know.

594
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:00,646
Levitaius dominungus!

595
00:38:00,648 --> 00:38:02,115
- Uh, um... No, just...
- Put me... Chair!

596
00:38:02,117 --> 00:38:04,150
- No, I...
- Chair! Guys!

597
00:38:04,152 --> 00:38:06,618
Uh, uh...

598
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,754
- No, no, that's not right.
- Fiddlesticks.

599
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:10,156
Just get the...

600
00:38:10,158 --> 00:38:11,824
Um, just one... just...

601
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:19,798
Seriously, are you almost done?

602
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,334
Please hurry up!

603
00:38:21,336 --> 00:38:23,669
Water to the face
at a very high-speed pace.

604
00:38:29,044 --> 00:38:31,177
Shut up. Shut up.
Stop laughing.

605
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:32,711
It's not funny.

606
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:40,086
You can control the energy

607
00:38:40,088 --> 00:38:42,888
if you focus and channel it.

608
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,125
- Won't it kill me?
- Not if you focus.

609
00:38:45,127 --> 00:38:47,193
Then you are the conductor.
Watch.

610
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:52,865
Show me what you got.

611
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:00,073
Oh! Chair!

612
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:01,974
Sorry, chair!

613
00:39:01,976 --> 00:39:04,676
Ooh.

614
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:05,911
Not bad.

615
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,057
Oh.

616
00:39:50,891 --> 00:39:52,691
Three gongs, Florence.

617
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:54,760
Last time, it was four;
now it's three.

618
00:39:54,762 --> 00:39:56,962
What happens
when it gets down to one?

619
00:39:56,964 --> 00:39:58,730
We'll hide in the basement,
like sensible people.

620
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:00,433
Okay, this is no time
for jokes.

621
00:40:00,435 --> 00:40:02,801
Things have changed.

622
00:40:02,803 --> 00:40:04,002
I know.

623
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:07,840
Lewis.

624
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:09,875
What happens if he's here
when it goes off?

625
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:13,179
He won't be, because we
are going to find it.

626
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:16,082
We just have to hold it
together.

627
00:40:17,185 --> 00:40:18,752
Okay.

628
00:40:23,023 --> 00:40:24,892
Sorry.

629
00:40:26,061 --> 00:40:27,895
Let me get some butter.

630
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:45,247
Plaid button-down, please.

631
00:40:51,186 --> 00:40:53,186
And will the Indomitable

632
00:40:53,188 --> 00:40:54,753
Captain Midnight

633
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:56,788
defeat the dastardly
Comrade Ivan?

634
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,692
Maybe later, okay?

635
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:03,862
Come on, I'm gonna be late!

636
00:41:03,864 --> 00:41:05,298
- See ya.
- Toodles.

637
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,200
I'm getting out of here.

638
00:41:07,202 --> 00:41:09,135
No, stop!
Stop! You ain't going anywhere.

639
00:41:09,137 --> 00:41:11,204
I foolishly walked into a trap.

640
00:41:11,206 --> 00:41:12,738
Why, you double-crossing hound.

641
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,839
Stay.

642
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:16,008
I'll have your life for this!

643
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,818
Yes!

644
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,354
Chair!

645
00:41:28,356 --> 00:41:30,123
And the winner of the

646
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,225
fourth grade
class president election is...

647
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:34,093
- Tarby Corrigan!
- Yeah!

648
00:41:37,532 --> 00:41:39,032
Thank you.

649
00:41:40,368 --> 00:41:42,101
Tarby. Excuse me.

650
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:44,002
Tarby. Congratulations, Tarby.

651
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:45,971
- Thanks, Lewis.
- If you want,

652
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:47,973
I can bring some cookies
tomorrow to celebrate.

653
00:41:47,975 --> 00:41:49,309
Yeah, Tarby.
Go have a cookie picnic

654
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:50,976
here with the little runt.

655
00:41:50,978 --> 00:41:52,811
Woody.

656
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:54,113
Just...

657
00:41:54,115 --> 00:41:55,849
I'll catch up later.

658
00:41:57,552 --> 00:41:59,352
Hey, you got your cast off.

659
00:41:59,354 --> 00:42:00,886
Do you want to go hit
some balls?

660
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:02,255
Sorry.

661
00:42:02,257 --> 00:42:03,989
The boys and me...

662
00:42:03,991 --> 00:42:05,857
we're gonna explore
Wilder Creek.

663
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:08,061
Maybe another time.

664
00:42:08,063 --> 00:42:10,165
I've got something
way better than that.

665
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,799
Oh, yeah?

666
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:14,967
My house.

667
00:42:14,969 --> 00:42:16,302
Everyone's wrong, you know.

668
00:42:16,304 --> 00:42:18,104
It's not haunted.

669
00:42:18,106 --> 00:42:19,840
It's magic.

670
00:42:22,843 --> 00:42:24,011
Magic?

671
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:26,878
Magic's not real.

672
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,147
It is real.

673
00:42:28,149 --> 00:42:30,083
My uncle...

674
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:31,217
he's a warlock.

675
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:32,851
That's a boy witch. And...

676
00:42:32,853 --> 00:42:35,355
I could teach you spells
to throw a curveball

677
00:42:35,357 --> 00:42:37,889
or-or hit a home run

678
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:40,859
or throw a touchdown
every single time.

679
00:42:40,861 --> 00:42:42,262
Cross my heart.

680
00:42:42,264 --> 00:42:44,299
You can see for yourself.

681
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:25,140
So, where is it already,
you evil old coot?

682
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
The arm.

683
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,251
Blasted pigeons.

684
00:45:00,368 --> 00:45:02,368
Got you.

685
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,370
I'll find you
that curveball spell.

686
00:45:04,372 --> 00:45:06,307
Just give me a sec.

687
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:10,178
Whoa. What's in there?

688
00:45:11,346 --> 00:45:13,013
Oh, I...

689
00:45:14,149 --> 00:45:16,048
We're not allowed to open it.

690
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,184
Oh, yeah? Why not?

691
00:45:18,186 --> 00:45:20,453
I don't know,
but it's my uncle's only rule.

692
00:45:20,455 --> 00:45:22,490
Besides, it's locked.

693
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,329
No... it's not.

694
00:45:33,201 --> 00:45:35,236
Tarby, I mean it. We can't.

695
00:45:37,338 --> 00:45:40,339
Don't be such a scaredy-cat.

696
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:43,576
Maybe it's the spell
you're looking for.

697
00:45:43,578 --> 00:45:45,213
No!

698
00:46:03,398 --> 00:46:05,097
What's...

699
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:06,499
necromancy?

700
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:09,035
"Noun. The practice
of communicating with the dead

701
00:46:09,037 --> 00:46:10,403
or raising them to life."

702
00:46:10,405 --> 00:46:12,371
Put it back.

703
00:46:12,373 --> 00:46:14,073
Raising the dead?

704
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:15,508
Now, <i>that</i> would be a trick.

705
00:46:22,417 --> 00:46:25,117
- Put it back! We have to put it back right now!
- Stop.

706
00:46:28,056 --> 00:46:29,188
Fine.

707
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,456
None of it's real anyways.

708
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,091
It's all just weird.

709
00:46:32,093 --> 00:46:33,394
You're just weird.

710
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,503
Was that the Corrigan boy?

711
00:46:43,505 --> 00:46:45,304
He was just leaving.

712
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:46,539
What were you two doing?

713
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:48,140
Nothing.

714
00:46:48,142 --> 00:46:49,609
Uncle Jonathan, do you want to

715
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:51,277
- play ball with me?
- I can't right now.

716
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:54,146
There's something
I need to look into.

717
00:46:54,148 --> 00:46:55,548
- Later, okay?
- Okay.

718
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:04,156
Isaac hid the room with a hex

719
00:47:04,158 --> 00:47:05,391
so no one would find these,

720
00:47:05,393 --> 00:47:07,360
but I can't make
heads or tails of this.

721
00:47:07,362 --> 00:47:09,529
I know about every
magic language there is...

722
00:47:09,531 --> 00:47:12,298
the Alberti cipher,
the Enochian glyphs...

723
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,100
but this...

724
00:47:14,102 --> 00:47:15,701
Really?

725
00:47:15,703 --> 00:47:17,403
Well, at least I lived to see

726
00:47:17,405 --> 00:47:18,671
the purple pachyderm
get stumped.

727
00:47:18,673 --> 00:47:20,306
I don't know how much longer

728
00:47:20,308 --> 00:47:22,308
any of us will be living,
weird beard.

729
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:23,609
- Cranky old crone.
- Mush brush.

730
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:25,545
- Hag face.
- Oh, go braid your back hair.

731
00:47:25,547 --> 00:47:27,880
I'd give you a nasty look,
but you've already got one.

732
00:47:27,882 --> 00:47:29,715
Okay, okay.

733
00:47:29,717 --> 00:47:32,153
You old yeti. Now, look.

734
00:47:35,456 --> 00:47:37,423
What does this mean to you?

735
00:47:37,425 --> 00:47:38,891
The omega.

736
00:47:38,893 --> 00:47:41,327
Isaac talked about it
when he died.

737
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:44,163
The last letter
of the Greek alphabet.

738
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:47,335
And in early Christianity?

739
00:47:49,237 --> 00:47:51,472
It means Judgment Day.

740
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,221
You all right, kiddo?

741
00:48:08,456 --> 00:48:10,124
I'm okay.

742
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:14,095
You always were a lousy liar.

743
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,934
You're lonely, huh?

744
00:48:21,936 --> 00:48:26,472
I just wish Jonathan
wasn't so busy.

745
00:48:26,474 --> 00:48:28,443
I wish he could spend
more time with you.

746
00:48:30,378 --> 00:48:32,447
It's okay.

747
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:35,514
What about Tarby?

748
00:48:35,516 --> 00:48:37,383
Tarby hates me.

749
00:48:37,385 --> 00:48:39,785
Oh, you can fix that.

750
00:48:39,787 --> 00:48:41,621
Easy.

751
00:48:41,623 --> 00:48:43,522
Just show him some real magic.

752
00:48:43,524 --> 00:48:45,424
I can't do any real magic.

753
00:48:45,426 --> 00:48:46,726
Yes, you can.

754
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:48,728
With the book, silly.

755
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:51,631
The one I told you to find.

756
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:54,333
Well, you found it, didn't you?

757
00:48:54,335 --> 00:48:55,601
Book?

758
00:48:55,603 --> 00:48:57,670
You mean the necromancy book
in the library?

759
00:48:57,672 --> 00:49:00,373
Uncle Jonathan told me
never to even touch it.

760
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:02,408
Oh, he won't mind.

761
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,545
He's too busy anyways.

762
00:49:06,481 --> 00:49:07,747
Take the book.

763
00:49:07,749 --> 00:49:10,516
Show Tarby a real trick.

764
00:49:10,518 --> 00:49:13,519
He's gonna be
your friend again.

765
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:15,521
I know it.

766
00:49:21,229 --> 00:49:23,229
Tarby's a jerk, you know.

767
00:49:23,231 --> 00:49:24,697
He runs for president
every year,

768
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:28,334
and he's always nice
until the election.

769
00:49:28,336 --> 00:49:29,769
- After that...
- Hey! Over here!

770
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:33,305
...he goes back to being him.

771
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:35,307
You don't need him.

772
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,643
We could go look for spiders.

773
00:49:37,645 --> 00:49:39,645
If you want.

774
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:43,718
Just leave me alone, okay?

775
00:49:50,558 --> 00:49:52,326
Tarby!

776
00:49:54,762 --> 00:49:57,396
Okay. You want to see
some real magic?

777
00:49:57,398 --> 00:49:58,597
I'll show you.

778
00:49:58,599 --> 00:49:59,732
Yeah?

779
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:02,668
You gonna saw a lady in half?

780
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,804
I'm gonna raise the dead.

781
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:06,372
You're a liar.

782
00:50:06,374 --> 00:50:07,606
No one can raise the dead.

783
00:50:07,608 --> 00:50:08,841
Watch me.

784
00:50:08,843 --> 00:50:10,743
Unless...

785
00:50:10,745 --> 00:50:12,411
unless you're scared.

786
00:50:13,881 --> 00:50:15,548
You need a babysitter?

787
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,483
Fine, but this whole thing

788
00:50:17,485 --> 00:50:19,754
is just gonna be
a big waste of time.

789
00:50:21,355 --> 00:50:22,888
When?

790
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

791
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,687
Tarby!

792
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:56,624
Tarby?

793
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,839
Boo!

794
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,777
Tarby, that's not funny.

795
00:51:17,779 --> 00:51:19,680
It is from here.

796
00:51:20,915 --> 00:51:23,618
Well, come on, smart guy.

797
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:29,455
Who are we gonna wake up?

798
00:51:29,457 --> 00:51:31,524
How about this one?

799
00:51:31,526 --> 00:51:33,425
The lamb means
that it's a kid's grave,

800
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:36,362
and I don't want
to raise up a kid.

801
00:51:36,364 --> 00:51:38,733
It's creepy that you know that.

802
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:46,407
This way, I think.

803
00:51:49,677 --> 00:51:51,610
Nice trick
with the book, Lewis.

804
00:51:51,612 --> 00:51:53,913
- I know that's you.
- No, it's not.

805
00:51:55,883 --> 00:51:57,783
Is that it?

806
00:51:57,785 --> 00:51:59,652
Yeah.

807
00:51:59,654 --> 00:52:01,422
I think so.

808
00:52:02,857 --> 00:52:04,659
Come on.

809
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Okay.

810
00:52:43,898 --> 00:52:47,766
"For thou who sleeps
in stone and clay,

811
00:52:47,768 --> 00:52:50,870
"heed this call...
rise up and obey.

812
00:52:50,872 --> 00:52:53,505
"Trek on through
the mortal door.

813
00:52:53,507 --> 00:52:56,842
Assemble flesh
and walk once more."

814
00:53:00,581 --> 00:53:02,915
So, what now?

815
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:04,650
That's it.

816
00:53:04,652 --> 00:53:06,585
That's all it says.

817
00:53:07,588 --> 00:53:09,521
See, I told you all this was...

818
00:53:17,698 --> 00:53:18,799
Tarby?

819
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:21,702
Tarby!

820
00:54:34,008 --> 00:54:36,477
Could you put those back,
please?

821
00:54:40,748 --> 00:54:42,614
He's coming home!

822
00:54:42,616 --> 00:54:44,984
- He's free.
- He's back!

823
00:54:44,986 --> 00:54:47,753
He's awake.

824
00:54:47,755 --> 00:54:49,688
He's coming home!

825
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,993
Coming home!

826
00:54:53,995 --> 00:54:55,661
- He's coming home.
- He's awake.

827
00:54:55,663 --> 00:54:57,030
Coming home. He's coming home.

828
00:54:57,032 --> 00:54:59,065
- He's coming home.
- Coming home.

829
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:00,866
- He's back!
- He's coming home.

830
00:55:00,868 --> 00:55:03,635
- He's awake.
- He's back!

831
00:55:03,637 --> 00:55:06,805
He's coming home.
He's coming home.

832
00:55:09,044 --> 00:55:11,079
That's not creepy.

833
00:55:24,192 --> 00:55:25,924
<i>Who'd be crazy enough</i>

834
00:55:25,926 --> 00:55:27,726
<i>to bring Isaac Izard back?</i>

835
00:55:27,728 --> 00:55:29,595
Someone suicidal.

836
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:34,633
The house knows he's back.

837
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:36,069
Can you feel that?

838
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:38,071
Like a dog with rabies.

839
00:55:38,073 --> 00:55:40,639
Knows his master's coming home.

840
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:42,875
I'm gonna need your help
on this one, Florence.

841
00:55:42,877 --> 00:55:44,044
My magic won't be enough.

842
00:55:44,046 --> 00:55:45,711
I'm barely qualified as it is.

843
00:55:45,713 --> 00:55:48,013
I can't.
I'll-I'll just mess it up.

844
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:50,050
- I can't do this alone.
- Well, you won't have to.

845
00:55:50,052 --> 00:55:51,683
- Lewis.
- What about Lewis?

846
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,053
He's stronger than you know.

847
00:55:53,055 --> 00:55:55,221
And one and a half warlocks
is better than nothing.

848
00:55:55,223 --> 00:55:57,756
- Just tell him the truth.
- No! He's just a boy.

849
00:55:57,758 --> 00:55:59,092
You're the smartest witch
I've ever known.

850
00:55:59,094 --> 00:56:00,893
You can cast spells
I can't even pronounce.

851
00:56:00,895 --> 00:56:02,596
I said I can't.

852
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:08,569
I can't.

853
00:56:10,072 --> 00:56:11,970
I'm sorry.

854
00:56:11,972 --> 00:56:13,639
Look...

855
00:56:13,641 --> 00:56:14,940
Isaac is coming back,

856
00:56:14,942 --> 00:56:16,844
and we can't let him
get inside.

857
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,978
Well...

858
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,216
if your magic is off-limits,
then what's the plan?

859
00:56:23,218 --> 00:56:26,020
I can still swing a hammer.

860
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:45,205
These are crazy people,
Marmalade.

861
00:56:45,207 --> 00:56:46,874
Crazy people.

862
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:51,244
Do you think these are enough
to keep Isaac out?

863
00:56:51,246 --> 00:56:53,246
Oh, yes.

864
00:56:53,248 --> 00:56:54,847
Maybe.

865
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:56,617
I'm gonna get some more.

866
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:18,904
Uncle Jonathan?

867
00:57:18,906 --> 00:57:20,839
Don't come up! I'm, uh...

868
00:57:20,841 --> 00:57:22,910
I'm coming down.

869
00:57:28,483 --> 00:57:29,882
Listen.

870
00:57:29,884 --> 00:57:31,317
I-I need to talk to you.

871
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:33,052
Not a great time, Lewis.

872
00:57:33,054 --> 00:57:35,088
I'm working
on a heavy-duty spell.

873
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:36,889
I want you to stay at Mrs. Z's

874
00:57:36,891 --> 00:57:38,324
- for a few days.
- Come on.

875
00:57:38,326 --> 00:57:40,792
I see the horseshoes.
I know something's wrong.

876
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:42,195
What are you talking about?
There... Everything's fine.

877
00:57:42,197 --> 00:57:43,496
No, it's not.

878
00:57:43,498 --> 00:57:45,131
You're right, Lewis.

879
00:57:45,133 --> 00:57:47,100
Something is wrong.

880
00:57:47,102 --> 00:57:48,967
- Something is very wrong.
- Florence.

881
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:51,104
He's got eyes, Jonathan.

882
00:57:51,106 --> 00:57:53,239
It's our friend, Isaac Izard.

883
00:57:53,241 --> 00:57:54,973
Except he's not our friend.

884
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:56,742
He's very wicked,
very powerful,

885
00:57:56,744 --> 00:57:59,312
and I'm afraid he's back
from the great beyond.

886
00:57:59,314 --> 00:58:02,014
Yeah, uh, that's what
I wanted to talk...

887
00:58:02,016 --> 00:58:04,750
And when we find out
who's raised him from the dead,

888
00:58:04,752 --> 00:58:07,920
they are going to be sorry...
very sorry.

889
00:58:07,922 --> 00:58:09,355
Oh. Mmm.

890
00:58:09,357 --> 00:58:11,823
Yeah, they... they sure will.

891
00:58:11,825 --> 00:58:13,092
Look.

892
00:58:13,094 --> 00:58:14,960
The truth is,

893
00:58:14,962 --> 00:58:16,828
it's not safe for you here.

894
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,064
At least not now.

895
00:58:18,066 --> 00:58:21,167
So go next door
with Florence, okay?

896
00:58:21,169 --> 00:58:23,802
Everything's gonna be fine.

897
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,221
Come on.

898
00:58:41,223 --> 00:58:42,388
Mrs. Zimmerman?

899
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:44,856
Uh, I'm sorry, dear?

900
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:46,259
What are you doing?

901
00:58:46,261 --> 00:58:49,095
I'm just trying...

902
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:54,236
Nothing.

903
00:59:00,275 --> 00:59:01,875
Wait.

904
00:59:03,278 --> 00:59:05,844
Isaac and Uncle Jonathan
used to perform together?

905
00:59:05,846 --> 00:59:08,316
They did everything together.

906
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:11,883
They were best friends.

907
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:12,920
They were?

908
00:59:14,055 --> 00:59:15,990
Once.

909
00:59:21,263 --> 00:59:24,097
Isaac was an orphan,

910
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:26,832
and Jonathan a runaway.

911
00:59:26,834 --> 00:59:29,868
Neither of them had family.

912
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:32,307
All they had was magic.

913
00:59:35,443 --> 00:59:37,377
And each other.

914
00:59:37,379 --> 00:59:41,047
Then Isaac went away to war.

915
00:59:41,049 --> 00:59:43,949
He was fighting in Germany,
when he went M.I.A.

916
00:59:43,951 --> 00:59:45,618
Months passed.

917
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:48,789
Then, suddenly,
Isaac came back home.

918
00:59:49,923 --> 00:59:52,327
But it wasn't the same Isaac.

919
00:59:54,195 --> 00:59:56,928
He was different.

920
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,997
And angry.

921
00:59:58,999 --> 01:00:03,069
And more powerful than any
warlock had the right to be.

922
01:00:03,071 --> 01:00:04,339
How?

923
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,373
What happened to him?

924
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:09,242
We don't know.

925
01:00:09,244 --> 01:00:13,479
All he said was he was lost
in the Black Forest.

926
01:00:13,481 --> 01:00:17,183
Now, that is a very old place

927
01:00:17,185 --> 01:00:19,452
with very old magic.

928
01:00:19,454 --> 01:00:22,121
It's where the Brothers Grimm
wrote their histories.

929
01:00:22,123 --> 01:00:23,425
You mean their fairy tales.

930
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,127
Now, we think that Isaac

931
01:00:28,129 --> 01:00:30,463
met a dark warlock
in those woods,

932
01:00:30,465 --> 01:00:32,964
a teacher who gave him

933
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:36,102
some terrifying,
forbidden books.

934
01:00:36,104 --> 01:00:38,438
One of which is so dangerous

935
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,108
that your uncle keeps it
locked up in his cabinet.

936
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:46,346
Then Isaac abandoned
poor Jonathan.

937
01:00:46,348 --> 01:00:47,680
No explanation.

938
01:00:47,682 --> 01:00:51,184
And he found himself
a witch, Selena.

939
01:00:51,186 --> 01:00:54,520
So spiteful and mean,
he married her.

940
01:00:54,522 --> 01:00:57,092
And they locked themselves away
in the house.

941
01:00:58,259 --> 01:01:00,693
Until one night last year...

942
01:01:00,695 --> 01:01:03,496
Isaac performed
a blood magic ritual

943
01:01:03,498 --> 01:01:05,198
that killed him.

944
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,499
What was the ritual for?

945
01:01:06,501 --> 01:01:09,000
To make a key.

946
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:11,002
A clock key.

947
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:12,407
Of human bone.

948
01:01:13,508 --> 01:01:16,311
We think his wife's bones.

949
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:21,249
We think Isaac killed Selena
to make it.

950
01:01:25,086 --> 01:01:27,553
Uncle Jonathan said that you
were a really good witch...

951
01:01:27,555 --> 01:01:29,555
even better than him.

952
01:01:29,557 --> 01:01:31,426
I was.

953
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:34,162
Once.

954
01:01:36,264 --> 01:01:38,498
My magic was the toast
of Paris.

955
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,967
You should have seen me
before the war.

956
01:01:41,969 --> 01:01:44,170
I melted Salvador Dalí's watch
one time,

957
01:01:44,172 --> 01:01:45,440
right off his wrist.

958
01:01:47,075 --> 01:01:48,410
Then why can't you help us?

959
01:01:55,116 --> 01:01:58,319
You know how magic comes
from the inside?

960
01:01:59,421 --> 01:02:01,087
Well...

961
01:02:01,089 --> 01:02:03,589
I got hurt one time.

962
01:02:03,591 --> 01:02:05,591
Pretty badly.

963
01:02:05,593 --> 01:02:09,462
And even though my outsides
got better,

964
01:02:09,464 --> 01:02:12,565
my insides never did.

965
01:02:12,567 --> 01:02:17,603
And so now, every time I try
to work any real magic,

966
01:02:17,605 --> 01:02:20,506
it just comes out...

967
01:02:20,508 --> 01:02:22,377
broken.

968
01:02:25,613 --> 01:02:27,513
Now...

969
01:02:29,184 --> 01:02:32,418
There's very few problems
in the world

970
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:34,620
that can't at least be helped

971
01:02:34,622 --> 01:02:37,991
by a good
chocolate chip cookie.

972
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:46,265
Tarby. Tarby!

973
01:02:46,267 --> 01:02:48,067
Not now, Lewis.
I'm late for gym.

974
01:02:48,069 --> 01:02:49,635
- No, now. We gotta talk now.
- What?

975
01:02:49,637 --> 01:02:51,370
- Let go!
- Where do you think you're going, huh?

976
01:02:51,372 --> 01:02:53,573
The other night,
what we did in the cemetery,

977
01:02:53,575 --> 01:02:55,274
we did something awful.

978
01:02:55,276 --> 01:02:57,410
My uncle's in trouble.
We all are, and...

979
01:02:57,412 --> 01:02:58,444
See, see, there's this clock.

980
01:02:58,446 --> 01:03:01,581
Lewis, just stop.

981
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:03,616
Nothing happened
in that cemetery.

982
01:03:03,618 --> 01:03:05,117
Look, I get it... you're scared.

983
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,252
I am, too. We're...

984
01:03:06,254 --> 01:03:08,120
Woody!

985
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:11,357
- Let's get out of here!
- Let's go!

986
01:03:15,163 --> 01:03:16,529
- Good morning, Miss Fisher.
- Woody.

987
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:18,197
I'm not scared.

988
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:20,166
And if you tell anyone
I was there,

989
01:03:20,168 --> 01:03:22,136
I'll break both your arms.

990
01:03:27,408 --> 01:03:29,208
You're just a weirdo.

991
01:03:41,089 --> 01:03:42,490
"Indomitable."

992
01:04:03,378 --> 01:04:05,177
Uncle Jonathan?

993
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:07,148
You in here?

994
01:04:20,328 --> 01:04:21,529
No way.

995
01:04:46,754 --> 01:04:49,221
Help me! Help, please!

996
01:04:49,223 --> 01:04:51,524
Help! Uncle Jonathan!

997
01:04:51,526 --> 01:04:53,359
Uncle Jonathan! Help!

998
01:04:53,361 --> 01:04:55,928
Help me, please!

999
01:04:57,632 --> 01:04:59,534
Get those papers!

1000
01:05:03,371 --> 01:05:05,538
Get, get, get. Get!

1001
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:07,473
Are you all right?

1002
01:05:07,475 --> 01:05:08,641
What are you doing here?

1003
01:05:08,643 --> 01:05:11,277
I told you it's not safe.

1004
01:05:11,279 --> 01:05:13,114
I was being indomitable.

1005
01:05:14,515 --> 01:05:16,616
I suppose you were,
weren't you?

1006
01:05:16,618 --> 01:05:18,250
You can't do this alone.

1007
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:19,485
You need help,

1008
01:05:19,487 --> 01:05:21,220
- and I can help you.
- No, you can't.

1009
01:05:21,222 --> 01:05:23,725
Actually, I can,
'cause I know how to read this.

1010
01:05:26,294 --> 01:05:29,228
But I'm gonna need
some Ovaltine.

1011
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:30,529
Wait, I-I don't understand.

1012
01:05:30,531 --> 01:05:32,331
- You've seen this code before?
- Yes.

1013
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:34,233
Comrade Ivan uses one
just like it

1014
01:05:34,235 --> 01:05:35,668
to send commands
to his Red Brigade.

1015
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:38,270
- Comrade who?
- Comrade Ivan from the TV show.

1016
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:41,540
But Captain Midnight always
stops him and decodes it...

1017
01:05:41,542 --> 01:05:43,709
with, uh...

1018
01:05:43,711 --> 01:05:46,214
this, the Captain Midnight
Secret Decoder Pin.

1019
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:48,681
I don't believe it.

1020
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:50,349
I don't
believe it.

1021
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:52,620
Three Ovaltine shakes, please.

1022
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:04,764
"With this clock, Selena and I

1023
01:06:04,766 --> 01:06:07,268
shall wipe
this filthy world clean."

1024
01:06:09,504 --> 01:06:11,673
It's a doomsday clock.

1025
01:06:13,608 --> 01:06:16,308
In a way,
it destroys everything,

1026
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:18,577
but not by ending the world,
but sending it back

1027
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:20,246
to the beginning.

1028
01:06:20,248 --> 01:06:21,814
If the planet
is one giant clock,

1029
01:06:21,816 --> 01:06:23,582
then this damn thing
is the winder.

1030
01:06:24,752 --> 01:06:26,452
He's winding it back

1031
01:06:26,454 --> 01:06:27,386
to the very beginning of time!

1032
01:06:27,388 --> 01:06:28,854
So everything goes

1033
01:06:28,856 --> 01:06:30,589
in reverse...
we grow younger and younger

1034
01:06:30,591 --> 01:06:32,625
until we vanish,
until there's no one left.

1035
01:06:34,429 --> 01:06:37,763
I knew Isaac was strong,
but this goes beyond anything

1036
01:06:37,765 --> 01:06:40,466
I ever thought
he was capable of.

1037
01:06:40,468 --> 01:06:41,602
When's it happen?

1038
01:06:42,704 --> 01:06:45,871
"When night's at its blackest."

1039
01:06:45,873 --> 01:06:48,541
The total lunar eclipse...
tonight.

1040
01:06:48,543 --> 01:06:50,876
All those moons painted
in my bedroom...

1041
01:06:50,878 --> 01:06:52,411
what if Isaac was studying them

1042
01:06:52,413 --> 01:06:53,879
and waiting
for the right moment?

1043
01:06:53,881 --> 01:06:55,717
That's what the gongs
are counting down to.

1044
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,662
We'll take the gumballs, too.

1045
01:07:16,571 --> 01:07:18,637
Isaac's been here.

1046
01:07:20,508 --> 01:07:22,641
Isaac pulled all
the horseshoes off?

1047
01:07:22,643 --> 01:07:24,877
Burned 'em off, one by one.

1048
01:07:24,879 --> 01:07:27,646
Like ants
with a magnifying glass.

1049
01:07:27,648 --> 01:07:29,915
Ooh, just how powerful
is he now?

1050
01:07:29,917 --> 01:07:31,817
Death's been good to him.

1051
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:33,354
Wait here.

1052
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,634
Chair! It's okay, it's okay.

1053
01:07:48,636 --> 01:07:50,936
I'm here. I'm here to help.

1054
01:07:50,938 --> 01:07:53,405
It's okay.

1055
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:54,673
You're okay.

1056
01:07:54,675 --> 01:07:57,676
He's torn the place to pieces.

1057
01:07:57,678 --> 01:08:00,479
He must have been looking
for something.

1058
01:08:00,481 --> 01:08:02,583
And I think I know what.

1059
01:08:04,685 --> 01:08:06,585
Well, what are we waiting for?

1060
01:08:06,587 --> 01:08:07,855
Let's get rid of it.

1061
01:08:12,894 --> 01:08:15,561
Uh, shouldn't this
be melting right now?

1062
01:08:15,563 --> 01:08:17,897
Too much
John the Conqueror root?

1063
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:19,498
No.

1064
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,433
Not enough goofer dust.

1065
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:22,635
Oh.

1066
01:08:22,637 --> 01:08:23,636
Grains of paradise.

1067
01:08:23,638 --> 01:08:25,404
We don't have
any grains of paradise.

1068
01:08:25,406 --> 01:08:26,405
You know what?

1069
01:08:26,407 --> 01:08:27,706
- Maybe a pinch of motherwort.
- Uncle Jonathan?

1070
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:28,908
How about some lotus root?

1071
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,143
Yeah, yeah, more lotus root.

1072
01:08:30,145 --> 01:08:32,678
- Uncle Jonathan.
- Hmm?

1073
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,513
This is my fault.

1074
01:08:34,515 --> 01:08:36,582
Lewis, you helped us.

1075
01:08:36,584 --> 01:08:38,617
You're the one
who decoded the blueprints.

1076
01:08:38,619 --> 01:08:39,654
No.

1077
01:08:41,389 --> 01:08:43,791
I mean I'm the one
who brought Isaac back.

1078
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:45,991
Lewis?

1079
01:08:45,993 --> 01:08:48,596
What are you talking about?

1080
01:08:50,531 --> 01:08:51,797
I opened the cabinet.

1081
01:08:51,799 --> 01:08:53,399
I used your book.

1082
01:08:53,401 --> 01:08:55,801
I-I'm so, so, so sorry.

1083
01:08:55,803 --> 01:08:57,736
No, you couldn't have.
You don't know enough magic

1084
01:08:57,738 --> 01:08:59,172
to pull off a spell like that.

1085
01:08:59,174 --> 01:09:02,474
I just followed the directions.

1086
01:09:02,476 --> 01:09:04,009
I bled onto the book.

1087
01:09:04,011 --> 01:09:06,614
Oh, Lewis.

1088
01:09:07,748 --> 01:09:09,782
Blood magic?

1089
01:09:09,784 --> 01:09:12,718
That was my one rule.

1090
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,854
I-I know. I'm sorry.

1091
01:09:14,856 --> 01:09:16,789
- And you broke it?
- I didn't mean to.

1092
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:19,525
So you opened
a forbidden cabinet

1093
01:09:19,527 --> 01:09:21,694
and performed an unholy ritual

1094
01:09:21,696 --> 01:09:23,462
- on accident?
- Jonathan.

1095
01:09:23,464 --> 01:09:24,630
I didn't know Isaac was evil.

1096
01:09:24,632 --> 01:09:25,764
You never told me.

1097
01:09:25,766 --> 01:09:26,799
Oh, so this is my fault?

1098
01:09:26,801 --> 01:09:27,800
I didn't say that.

1099
01:09:27,802 --> 01:09:29,035
Then what are you saying?!

1100
01:09:30,504 --> 01:09:31,704
What the hell
were you thinking?!

1101
01:09:31,706 --> 01:09:35,574
I just wanted Tarby
to be my friend again.

1102
01:09:35,576 --> 01:09:36,876
And I want my parents back.

1103
01:09:36,878 --> 01:09:38,510
And I figured,
if it worked here,

1104
01:09:38,512 --> 01:09:40,213
I could go home
and try it on them.

1105
01:09:42,683 --> 01:09:43,784
I just want my mom.

1106
01:09:47,655 --> 01:09:49,788
I'm sorry.

1107
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:51,824
It was a mistake.

1108
01:09:51,826 --> 01:09:53,759
You coming here.

1109
01:09:53,761 --> 01:09:56,495
Now, hold on, Jonathan.

1110
01:09:56,497 --> 01:09:57,763
No. No, please, please.

1111
01:09:57,765 --> 01:09:58,964
I'll-I'll make it up to you.

1112
01:09:58,966 --> 01:10:00,933
Please.

1113
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:04,070
No. This is no place for a kid.

1114
01:10:04,072 --> 01:10:06,705
It's not safe for you here.

1115
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:08,807
I was wrong to ever think
that it was.

1116
01:10:08,809 --> 01:10:10,009
But...

1117
01:10:10,011 --> 01:10:12,678
we're a bevy of swans.

1118
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,981
I'm sorry.

1119
01:10:16,684 --> 01:10:18,784
You stay here.

1120
01:10:18,786 --> 01:10:20,588
Let me talk to him.

1121
01:10:30,098 --> 01:10:32,564
I know I've got
a Malleus Maleficarum

1122
01:10:32,566 --> 01:10:34,500
around here somewhere.

1123
01:10:34,502 --> 01:10:36,437
Should help with the key.

1124
01:10:37,939 --> 01:10:39,538
Go ahead, yell at me.

1125
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:40,839
Call me some names.

1126
01:10:40,841 --> 01:10:42,044
No names.

1127
01:10:43,544 --> 01:10:45,047
Not this time.

1128
01:10:46,681 --> 01:10:47,980
Jonathan.

1129
01:10:47,982 --> 01:10:50,582
That little boy needs you.

1130
01:10:50,584 --> 01:10:51,850
But what he did...

1131
01:10:51,852 --> 01:10:53,719
He's a child.

1132
01:10:53,721 --> 01:10:56,089
Children make mistakes.
They get in trouble.

1133
01:10:56,091 --> 01:10:57,723
That's why they're children.

1134
01:10:57,725 --> 01:11:00,726
No, this is not swiping
a comic book, Florence.

1135
01:11:00,728 --> 01:11:02,728
This is... I-I...

1136
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:04,630
I-I... I don't have
a choice here.

1137
01:11:04,632 --> 01:11:06,299
Of course you do.

1138
01:11:06,301 --> 01:11:08,734
You could stick it out.

1139
01:11:08,736 --> 01:11:11,037
No, no, when the going
gets tough,

1140
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:13,739
you get going
right for the exit.

1141
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:16,109
Like how you ran away
from your family.

1142
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:17,977
Ran away? My dad threw me out!

1143
01:11:17,979 --> 01:11:19,878
And what about
your little sister?

1144
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,613
She looked up to you.

1145
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:23,916
She needed you,
and now she's gone.

1146
01:11:23,918 --> 01:11:25,951
And you're going to abandon
her only child.

1147
01:11:25,953 --> 01:11:28,154
Look, I don't know
how to take care of a kid.

1148
01:11:28,156 --> 01:11:30,556
How to talk to him,
how to keep him safe.

1149
01:11:30,558 --> 01:11:31,890
Especially now.

1150
01:11:31,892 --> 01:11:33,625
- I'm just...
- You're scared.

1151
01:11:33,627 --> 01:11:34,893
Yes, all right?

1152
01:11:34,895 --> 01:11:36,762
I'm scared... for Lewis.

1153
01:11:36,764 --> 01:11:37,997
Scared he'll get hurt.

1154
01:11:37,999 --> 01:11:39,500
Well, guess what, genius.

1155
01:11:40,568 --> 01:11:42,035
That is the whole point.

1156
01:11:42,037 --> 01:11:45,738
Having a child means
being scared for them 24-7

1157
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:47,706
and doing it anyway.

1158
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:50,943
It's the whole damn
job description.

1159
01:11:50,945 --> 01:11:53,912
And I would give everything
to have that job again.

1160
01:11:53,914 --> 01:11:56,617
To have my little girl
back to...

1161
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,720
You know what?

1162
01:12:01,722 --> 01:12:04,090
I do have a name for you.

1163
01:12:04,092 --> 01:12:07,561
Jonathan Barnavelt,
you're a coward.

1164
01:12:30,818 --> 01:12:33,754
Mrs. Hanchett! Mrs. Hanchett!

1165
01:12:34,989 --> 01:12:36,688
- Lewis.
- He's free.

1166
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:37,990
He's in there.
We gotta go now!

1167
01:12:37,992 --> 01:12:39,225
Well, who?
What are we talking about?

1168
01:12:39,227 --> 01:12:40,226
There is someone in your house!

1169
01:12:40,228 --> 01:12:41,727
- Please hurry!
- Who?

1170
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:43,063
- Come on!
- Oh, take Marmalade.

1171
01:12:43,065 --> 01:12:44,663
Wait.

1172
01:12:44,665 --> 01:12:45,798
- Come on! Hurry! Please!
- Hold on.

1173
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,833
- We don't care about the door!
- What? Lewis, it's cold.

1174
01:12:47,835 --> 01:12:49,202
- He's upstairs! I saw him!
- Oh, my God.

1175
01:12:49,204 --> 01:12:50,936
- He's in your house right now!
- Lewis!

1176
01:12:50,938 --> 01:12:53,972
- Please! Hurry! Hurry!
- Lewis! Lewis!

1177
01:12:53,974 --> 01:12:54,973
- Come on!
- Wait, hold on, Lewis.

1178
01:12:54,975 --> 01:12:56,742
- It's slippery, Lewis!
- Come on, run! Hurry!

1179
01:12:56,744 --> 01:12:57,876
- Mrs. Hanchett, hurry!
- Hold on!

1180
01:12:57,878 --> 01:12:59,745
It's slippery, Lewis! Stop!

1181
01:12:59,747 --> 01:13:01,147
You're not making any sense.

1182
01:13:01,149 --> 01:13:03,183
- What bad man?
- His name is Isaac.

1183
01:13:03,185 --> 01:13:04,250
- Isaac Izard.
- Isaac Izard?

1184
01:13:04,252 --> 01:13:05,851
Lewis, he's dead.

1185
01:13:05,853 --> 01:13:07,721
He died last year.

1186
01:13:08,789 --> 01:13:10,022
Stay here.

1187
01:13:10,024 --> 01:13:12,825
Uncle Jonathan! Mrs. Zimmerman!

1188
01:13:16,064 --> 01:13:17,598
It's locked.

1189
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,800
It must be Isaac.
Out of the way.

1190
01:13:28,143 --> 01:13:30,210
Mrs. Hanchett,
get away from the door.

1191
01:13:30,212 --> 01:13:32,613
- Don't be ridiculous.
- No!

1192
01:13:48,829 --> 01:13:51,231
Hello, Lewis.

1193
01:13:57,771 --> 01:13:58,937
Mmm.

1194
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:01,042
Stay away from her.

1195
01:14:03,044 --> 01:14:05,478
Why should I stay away

1196
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:09,717
from my beautiful wife?

1197
01:14:18,126 --> 01:14:20,095
You're Selena Izard?

1198
01:14:56,964 --> 01:14:59,798
In the flesh.

1199
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,966
Uncle Jonathan!

1200
01:15:00,968 --> 01:15:02,302
Lewis!

1201
01:15:02,304 --> 01:15:04,270
But... but you died.

1202
01:15:04,272 --> 01:15:06,805
Whoever said I died?

1203
01:15:06,807 --> 01:15:08,874
- Isaac!
- Isaac!

1204
01:15:08,876 --> 01:15:10,143
Isaac?

1205
01:15:11,313 --> 01:15:13,112
Isaac!

1206
01:15:21,289 --> 01:15:23,289
Is that bone?

1207
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:25,325
Human.

1208
01:15:25,327 --> 01:15:28,894
He killed her
to make some sort of key.

1209
01:15:28,896 --> 01:15:30,363
I thought it was made from...

1210
01:15:30,365 --> 01:15:32,831
Not my bone, no.

1211
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:35,834
That was a chunk
from the real Mrs. Hanchett.

1212
01:15:35,836 --> 01:15:37,203
Lovely woman.

1213
01:15:37,205 --> 01:15:39,239
That is, before I killed her
and took her place.

1214
01:15:39,241 --> 01:15:41,176
My wife.

1215
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:45,245
She has a talent for disguises.

1216
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,947
- I learned from the best.
- Aw.

1217
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:02,061
Come give your mommy a kiss.

1218
01:16:02,063 --> 01:16:03,229
You.

1219
01:16:03,231 --> 01:16:05,598
It was you in my dreams.

1220
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,034
I couldn't get near
that locked cabinet.

1221
01:16:08,036 --> 01:16:09,901
The charms were too strong.

1222
01:16:09,903 --> 01:16:14,207
But you... you could get
that nasty old book for me.

1223
01:16:14,209 --> 01:16:16,175
Raise Isaac for me.

1224
01:16:16,177 --> 01:16:19,078
You could do everything
I wanted.

1225
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,347
And now...

1226
01:16:21,349 --> 01:16:25,618
you are going to get us
that clock key.

1227
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:36,928
No, no, not... ah, not there!

1228
01:16:44,205 --> 01:16:45,937
Hmm.

1229
01:16:48,343 --> 01:16:51,177
Well, come on!

1230
01:16:51,179 --> 01:16:53,479
- Now you're just showing off.
- Lewis!

1231
01:16:54,982 --> 01:16:56,950
- Lewis!
- Lewis, where are you?

1232
01:17:00,055 --> 01:17:02,088
- Isaac took him.
- Yes, but where?

1233
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:04,090
I think I know.

1234
01:17:19,441 --> 01:17:20,972
Uncle Jonathan!

1235
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:22,941
- Lewis!
- We're coming.

1236
01:17:22,943 --> 01:17:24,245
Mrs. Zimmerman,
I'm over here! I'm over here!

1237
01:17:27,215 --> 01:17:29,315
Uncle Jonathan, over here!

1238
01:17:29,317 --> 01:17:31,250
Here! No, over here!

1239
01:17:31,252 --> 01:17:32,452
Help me!

1240
01:17:38,226 --> 01:17:42,128
Barnavelt and Izard,
masters of prestidigitation,

1241
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:45,264
beloved by the crown heads
of Europe,

1242
01:17:45,266 --> 01:17:47,133
together again.

1243
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:51,937
I'm sure you'll remember
my next trick.

1244
01:17:55,543 --> 01:17:57,377
- No! -FLORENCE: No!
- Uncle Jonathan!

1245
01:17:57,379 --> 01:18:00,046
Isaac, don't do this.

1246
01:18:00,048 --> 01:18:02,415
I like the boy.

1247
01:18:02,417 --> 01:18:04,417
An orphan with a love
for <i>Captain Midnight?</i>

1248
01:18:04,419 --> 01:18:05,984
Mmm.

1249
01:18:05,986 --> 01:18:08,021
Warms my dead heart.

1250
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:12,158
Please don't make me
butcher him.

1251
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,026
Give me the key.

1252
01:18:14,028 --> 01:18:15,461
You don't have to hurt anyone.

1253
01:18:15,463 --> 01:18:18,131
Just tell us...
where is the clock?

1254
01:18:18,133 --> 01:18:21,033
The clock is under
a witch's hex.

1255
01:18:21,035 --> 01:18:22,402
You'll never find it.

1256
01:18:22,404 --> 01:18:25,271
- This is over.
- Isaac, please.

1257
01:18:25,273 --> 01:18:27,740
There must be some part of you
that doesn't want this,

1258
01:18:27,742 --> 01:18:30,476
that isn't completely dead.

1259
01:18:30,478 --> 01:18:33,045
I was dead long before I died.

1260
01:18:33,047 --> 01:18:34,980
We know you went through

1261
01:18:34,982 --> 01:18:36,449
something awful during the war.

1262
01:18:36,451 --> 01:18:37,750
We all did.

1263
01:18:37,752 --> 01:18:40,018
Oh, on the contrary.

1264
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:45,057
It's where I met my teacher.

1265
01:18:45,059 --> 01:18:47,460
My unit had been caught
in an ambush.

1266
01:18:47,462 --> 01:18:49,030
Everyone slaughtered.

1267
01:18:50,064 --> 01:18:51,397
I'd been left for dead.

1268
01:18:51,399 --> 01:18:54,434
I stumbled through
the Black Forest for days.

1269
01:18:54,436 --> 01:18:58,438
I chanted every spell I knew,
with one thought only:

1270
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:02,508
"Make me powerful enough
to end this."

1271
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:06,080
<i>To erase the horrors
I had witnessed.</i>

1272
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:11,085
<i>When I opened my eyes...</i>

1273
01:19:12,187 --> 01:19:13,154
<i>I saw him.</i>

1274
01:19:15,423 --> 01:19:17,523
<i>He offered me
something to drink.</i>

1275
01:19:19,327 --> 01:19:22,030
<i>For a small price, of course.</i>

1276
01:19:28,503 --> 01:19:31,573
Suddenly, I had it.

1277
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:35,041
<i>The blueprints for the clock.</i>

1278
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:38,146
<i>In my mind.</i>

1279
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,519
Clear as day.

1280
01:19:45,587 --> 01:19:47,220
That wasn't a warlock.

1281
01:19:47,222 --> 01:19:48,521
It wasn't even a human.

1282
01:19:48,523 --> 01:19:50,289
It was a demon,
you reckless idiot!

1283
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:51,424
You summoned a demon!

1284
01:19:51,426 --> 01:19:53,593
Yes, yes.

1285
01:19:53,595 --> 01:19:56,395
Azazel, to be exact.

1286
01:19:56,397 --> 01:19:58,164
The fourth prince of hell.

1287
01:19:58,166 --> 01:20:00,333
Oh, he gave me
a wonderful gift.

1288
01:20:01,836 --> 01:20:04,403
The greatest magic trick ever.

1289
01:20:04,405 --> 01:20:07,540
I'm going to make people
disappear.

1290
01:20:07,542 --> 01:20:11,277
Spin the world back
until the dawn of time.

1291
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:14,247
All that will be left...

1292
01:20:14,249 --> 01:20:16,349
- Selena and I.
- But...

1293
01:20:16,351 --> 01:20:18,551
if you go back
to the beginning,

1294
01:20:18,553 --> 01:20:21,287
history, humans, it will all
just start over again.

1295
01:20:21,289 --> 01:20:22,855
No.

1296
01:20:22,857 --> 01:20:25,691
I'll make sure people
are never born this time.

1297
01:20:25,693 --> 01:20:29,095
<i>With the help of a friend.</i>

1298
01:20:29,097 --> 01:20:32,532
Lewis's parents won't die
in that awful crash.

1299
01:20:32,534 --> 01:20:35,434
Your husband and sweet
little girl won't be killed.

1300
01:20:35,436 --> 01:20:37,870
They'll never have existed.

1301
01:20:37,872 --> 01:20:41,140
No people, no war.

1302
01:20:41,142 --> 01:20:42,343
Now, Jonathan...

1303
01:20:43,645 --> 01:20:45,578
The key.

1304
01:20:47,682 --> 01:20:49,549
Florence?

1305
01:20:49,551 --> 01:20:51,617
Now would be a good time...

1306
01:20:51,619 --> 01:20:53,388
for a little... magic.

1307
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:56,622
Of all people, Florence,

1308
01:20:56,624 --> 01:20:58,424
I thought you'd want this.

1309
01:20:58,426 --> 01:21:01,193
I know what losing
your family did to you.

1310
01:21:01,195 --> 01:21:03,496
You're too sad and broken...

1311
01:21:03,498 --> 01:21:06,334
...to work any real magic.

1312
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:10,338
Maybe I was.

1313
01:21:11,706 --> 01:21:14,140
But now...

1314
01:21:14,142 --> 01:21:16,742
I'm indomitable.

1315
01:21:27,422 --> 01:21:30,222
Marmalade, now!

1316
01:21:58,353 --> 01:22:00,686
- Where are they?
- They're gone.

1317
01:22:00,688 --> 01:22:03,189
Mind your step.
There's a tongue.

1318
01:22:03,191 --> 01:22:04,659
- I've got it.
- There's a big tongue.

1319
01:22:20,541 --> 01:22:23,444
So... creepy.

1320
01:22:29,684 --> 01:22:31,350
Oh, oh!

1321
01:22:35,657 --> 01:22:36,756
Uncle Jonathan!
Uncle Jonathan!

1322
01:22:37,725 --> 01:22:40,693
Lewis, don't freak them out!

1323
01:22:40,695 --> 01:22:43,262
Unhand me.
Let me go!

1324
01:22:43,264 --> 01:22:45,498
- Mommy. Mommy.
- Put me down! Stop!

1325
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:56,809
Why won't you talk to me?

1326
01:22:56,811 --> 01:22:58,577
Why won't you talk to me?

1327
01:23:00,415 --> 01:23:01,781
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1328
01:23:03,651 --> 01:23:05,685
Hey, wait! Help us!

1329
01:23:05,687 --> 01:23:07,853
Jonathan!

1330
01:23:07,855 --> 01:23:10,456
- Let me go!
- Let go of me! Let go of me!

1331
01:23:10,458 --> 01:23:12,326
- Jonathan!
- Jonathan! Jonathan!

1332
01:23:16,397 --> 01:23:17,863
- Lewis, you okay?
- I'm okay.

1333
01:23:17,865 --> 01:23:19,832
Would you look at that?

1334
01:23:19,834 --> 01:23:21,667
Okay, let's get back in there.

1335
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:23,536
What, with those
creepy metal monsters inside?

1336
01:23:23,538 --> 01:23:25,538
- They'll tear us to shreds.
- Florence, we have to find

1337
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:26,605
Isaac and Selena.

1338
01:23:31,046 --> 01:23:32,878
You heard Isaac.
He's using a witch's hex!

1339
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,480
I understand that.
So, should we just

1340
01:23:34,482 --> 01:23:35,815
sit around and try
to figure out the hex?

1341
01:23:35,817 --> 01:23:37,483
- No. We need a plan!
- We don't have time!

1342
01:23:37,485 --> 01:23:39,285
Guys!

1343
01:23:46,728 --> 01:23:49,361
Oh, my giddy aunt.

1344
01:23:49,363 --> 01:23:50,730
Don't worry. Their teeth
are made of pumpkin.

1345
01:23:50,732 --> 01:23:51,864
They can't really hurt us.

1346
01:23:58,306 --> 01:24:00,439
Okay, I made that up.

1347
01:24:07,648 --> 01:24:09,782
Some kind of ungodly adhesive.

1348
01:24:09,784 --> 01:24:12,318
I'm stuck!

1349
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,652
Me, too.

1350
01:24:13,654 --> 01:24:14,820
You know, I didn't think

1351
01:24:14,822 --> 01:24:16,555
this is how I was gonna die.

1352
01:24:18,392 --> 01:24:19,892
Look! Mrs. Zimmerman,
grab my shirt.

1353
01:24:19,894 --> 01:24:21,327
I got you.

1354
01:24:22,797 --> 01:24:24,097
- Just chop!
- Lewis, hurry!

1355
01:24:24,099 --> 01:24:25,698
Chop! Chop!

1356
01:24:31,672 --> 01:24:32,807
God, I hate pumpkins.

1357
01:24:38,546 --> 01:24:40,446
Did you see that, Florence?

1358
01:24:40,448 --> 01:24:42,815
I exploded it with a psychic
energy blast. It worked!

1359
01:24:42,817 --> 01:24:45,551
Yes, Jonathan.
We're all very proud of you.

1360
01:24:45,553 --> 01:24:47,486
Did you see that I now
have the power?

1361
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:49,421
Yes, I understand. Gold star.

1362
01:24:54,395 --> 01:24:55,494
<i>Uncle Jonathan.</i>

1363
01:24:55,496 --> 01:24:57,363
<i>Uncle Jonathan, it's me.
Please wake up!</i>

1364
01:24:57,365 --> 01:24:58,664
- Jonathan.
- Uncle Jonathan.

1365
01:24:58,666 --> 01:24:59,832
Jonathan, you've got to get up.

1366
01:24:59,834 --> 01:25:01,400
You've got to get up right now!

1367
01:25:01,402 --> 01:25:02,902
Uncle Jonathan!

1368
01:25:02,904 --> 01:25:05,738
What are you looking at,
you shriveled old prune?

1369
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:08,974
I'm looking at you,
you dumb baby orangutan.

1370
01:25:08,976 --> 01:25:10,943
Aw, Lewis.

1371
01:25:10,945 --> 01:25:12,711
Oh, Florence,
you missed a spot.

1372
01:25:12,713 --> 01:25:14,914
Lewis...

1373
01:25:14,916 --> 01:25:17,583
I'm sorry, Lewis.
I'm sorry about everything.

1374
01:25:17,585 --> 01:25:18,951
It's okay.

1375
01:25:18,953 --> 01:25:21,420
- Me, too.
- Don't get me wrong.

1376
01:25:21,422 --> 01:25:23,856
Uh, this is lovely,
but there's only 18 minutes

1377
01:25:23,858 --> 01:25:25,591
till the eclipse.

1378
01:25:25,593 --> 01:25:26,859
And they've got the key.

1379
01:25:26,861 --> 01:25:28,661
How do we find the clock?

1380
01:25:28,663 --> 01:25:30,163
We can't.

1381
01:25:30,165 --> 01:25:31,831
It's got a witch's hex on it.

1382
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:33,866
That means it's hidden
from every witch or warlock,

1383
01:25:33,868 --> 01:25:35,401
no matter how powerful.

1384
01:25:35,403 --> 01:25:36,602
Not even Florence
could find it.

1385
01:25:36,604 --> 01:25:38,470
There must be something

1386
01:25:38,472 --> 01:25:40,472
we're not thinking of.

1387
01:25:44,879 --> 01:25:46,547
Maybe I could find it.

1388
01:25:47,615 --> 01:25:49,615
I'm not a witch or warlock.

1389
01:25:49,617 --> 01:25:51,550
Well, not-not yet anyways,
but...

1390
01:25:51,552 --> 01:25:53,786
maybe if I tried some magic,

1391
01:25:53,788 --> 01:25:55,523
would that work?

1392
01:26:00,862 --> 01:26:02,028
Okay.

1393
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:03,662
I'm ready.

1394
01:26:03,664 --> 01:26:05,998
Lewis, I don't know
about that 8 Ball.

1395
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,034
Hey, this is my magic,
not yours.

1396
01:26:10,605 --> 01:26:12,006
Let's go.

1397
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:17,776
"Locate. Verb.

1398
01:26:17,778 --> 01:26:21,214
To discover the exact place
and position of."

1399
01:26:21,216 --> 01:26:22,915
"Secret. Adjective.

1400
01:26:22,917 --> 01:26:24,917
Something that is kept
unknown or unseen."

1401
01:26:24,919 --> 01:26:27,220
"Clock. Noun.

1402
01:26:27,222 --> 01:26:29,688
"A mechanical device used
for measuring time.

1403
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:30,856
"A timepiece.

1404
01:26:30,858 --> 01:26:33,659
A horologe!"

1405
01:26:33,661 --> 01:26:35,494
Wow.

1406
01:26:35,496 --> 01:26:37,596
- He is weird.
- Isn't he, though?

1407
01:26:37,598 --> 01:26:39,798
Locate the secret clock.

1408
01:26:40,868 --> 01:26:43,804
Locate the secret clock!

1409
01:26:45,873 --> 01:26:47,973
Please, Mom and Dad.

1410
01:26:47,975 --> 01:26:51,545
Tell me where the clock is,
please.

1411
01:27:01,689 --> 01:27:03,022
"Under the boiler."

1412
01:27:03,024 --> 01:27:05,826
Lewis, you genius.

1413
01:27:18,005 --> 01:27:19,571
Shall we?

1414
01:27:43,798 --> 01:27:45,700
Trick or treat!

1415
01:28:00,982 --> 01:28:03,649
- Mrs. Zimmerman?
- Hmm?

1416
01:28:03,651 --> 01:28:04,850
What is that?

1417
01:28:07,122 --> 01:28:09,021
Jonathan.

1418
01:28:09,023 --> 01:28:10,889
Open the door.

1419
01:28:10,891 --> 01:28:12,025
Working on it.

1420
01:28:12,027 --> 01:28:14,160
Jonathan.

1421
01:28:16,031 --> 01:28:17,663
Jonathan!

1422
01:28:17,665 --> 01:28:18,764
That's not helping.

1423
01:28:30,878 --> 01:28:31,946
Lewis.

1424
01:28:33,048 --> 01:28:34,880
Crack it open.

1425
01:28:48,662 --> 01:28:53,699
Even in death, so creepy.

1426
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1427
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:41,980
Florence, I really have to pee.

1428
01:29:41,982 --> 01:29:43,951
Not the time, Jonathan.

1429
01:30:13,181 --> 01:30:14,746
Snakespeare!

1430
01:30:14,748 --> 01:30:16,849
- Mrs. Zimmerman!
- Florence!

1431
01:30:16,851 --> 01:30:19,219
Go! Go!

1432
01:30:19,221 --> 01:30:21,854
It's okay. She knows how
to handle Snakespeare.

1433
01:30:21,856 --> 01:30:24,024
Come here. Quickly.

1434
01:30:25,093 --> 01:30:26,128
Isaac!

1435
01:30:27,895 --> 01:30:29,095
Stop!

1436
01:30:34,169 --> 01:30:36,169
Please.

1437
01:30:36,171 --> 01:30:39,771
I taught you everything
you know, Jonathan.

1438
01:30:39,773 --> 01:30:42,177
I didn't teach you
everything I know.

1439
01:31:03,898 --> 01:31:06,101
My darling.

1440
01:31:08,069 --> 01:31:10,802
No!

1441
01:31:21,249 --> 01:31:23,149
Wait there, Lewis.

1442
01:31:23,151 --> 01:31:24,950
- No, I have to come with you.
- No!

1443
01:31:24,952 --> 01:31:26,252
There may be traps.

1444
01:31:26,254 --> 01:31:28,223
I have protection.

1445
01:31:44,105 --> 01:31:45,205
I feel something.

1446
01:31:45,207 --> 01:31:47,140
I got it!

1447
01:31:51,845 --> 01:31:53,781
Uncle Jonathan!

1448
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:13,333
Uncle Jonathan?

1449
01:32:13,335 --> 01:32:14,933
Uncle Jonathan!

1450
01:32:17,138 --> 01:32:18,338
Shh, shh. It's okay.

1451
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:20,005
It's okay. It's okay.

1452
01:32:20,007 --> 01:32:21,873
Shh. It's me, Lewis,
your nephew.

1453
01:32:21,875 --> 01:32:23,276
Shh, shh.

1454
01:32:23,278 --> 01:32:24,943
Lewis!

1455
01:32:24,945 --> 01:32:27,146
Come with us to the turret.

1456
01:32:27,148 --> 01:32:29,148
It's a special turret.

1457
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:30,916
It'll protect us.

1458
01:32:30,918 --> 01:32:32,218
I like you, Lewis.

1459
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:34,019
I like being your mom.

1460
01:32:34,021 --> 01:32:35,421
Forget about your uncle.

1461
01:32:35,423 --> 01:32:37,056
Soon, he'll be gone.

1462
01:32:37,058 --> 01:32:39,359
Like everyone else.

1463
01:32:39,361 --> 01:32:40,926
Uncle Jonathan?

1464
01:32:40,928 --> 01:32:42,428
Uncle Jonathan!

1465
01:32:49,037 --> 01:32:50,038
Huh?

1466
01:32:51,106 --> 01:32:52,305
Hey. I got you.

1467
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,273
What?

1468
01:33:34,316 --> 01:33:36,384
Mom, Dad, what should I do?

1469
01:33:40,221 --> 01:33:41,654
"Say good-bye."

1470
01:33:41,656 --> 01:33:43,222
Say good-bye? I don't get it!

1471
01:33:43,224 --> 01:33:44,923
What do you mean?

1472
01:33:51,266 --> 01:33:53,099
Okay. Good-bye, guys.

1473
01:33:54,169 --> 01:33:55,437
I love you.

1474
01:34:03,511 --> 01:34:05,211
Look, my darling.

1475
01:34:05,213 --> 01:34:07,012
It's beginning.

1476
01:34:09,184 --> 01:34:12,418
The sands of time are shifting.

1477
01:34:39,347 --> 01:34:41,147
Quickly!

1478
01:34:41,149 --> 01:34:43,449
- Something is wrong.
- What is it?

1479
01:34:43,451 --> 01:34:44,950
Help me.

1480
01:34:48,289 --> 01:34:49,288
No.

1481
01:34:53,361 --> 01:34:55,163
Yes!

1482
01:35:07,542 --> 01:35:11,277
I'm gonna show you
what a little weird can do.

1483
01:35:38,573 --> 01:35:41,240
What?

1484
01:35:49,317 --> 01:35:51,317
Uncle Jonathan.

1485
01:35:51,319 --> 01:35:53,453
I'm back.

1486
01:35:53,455 --> 01:35:55,121
You did it.

1487
01:35:55,123 --> 01:35:58,090
You stopped the clock!

1488
01:35:58,092 --> 01:36:01,060
Do not tell Florence
about the baby body.

1489
01:36:01,062 --> 01:36:02,562
She'll never let me
live it down.

1490
01:36:02,564 --> 01:36:04,530
- I won't.
- You promise?

1491
01:36:04,532 --> 01:36:05,598
I swear.

1492
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,467
- No baby body.
- Warlock secret?

1493
01:36:07,469 --> 01:36:09,335
Never happened.

1494
01:36:09,337 --> 01:36:10,536
You're the best.

1495
01:36:10,538 --> 01:36:12,271
You did it.

1496
01:36:12,273 --> 01:36:14,042
Toss me my trousers.

1497
01:36:16,444 --> 01:36:18,177
Not a word to Florence.
I'm serious.

1498
01:36:18,179 --> 01:36:20,112
Well, well, well.

1499
01:36:20,114 --> 01:36:22,215
Look what the cat threw up.

1500
01:36:26,087 --> 01:36:27,453
Whew!

1501
01:36:27,455 --> 01:36:29,155
Oh, you fixed Snakespeare!

1502
01:36:29,157 --> 01:36:31,190
Well, you stopped the clock?

1503
01:36:31,192 --> 01:36:33,159
Nah, I just wet my pants.

1504
01:36:33,161 --> 01:36:34,427
Literally.

1505
01:36:34,429 --> 01:36:36,596
Lewis stopped the clock.

1506
01:36:36,598 --> 01:36:38,664
Lewis.

1507
01:36:38,666 --> 01:36:41,402
You are indomitable.

1508
01:36:44,305 --> 01:36:45,507
Mrs. Zimmerman...

1509
01:36:47,275 --> 01:36:49,141
I'm sorry you lost your family.

1510
01:36:49,143 --> 01:36:51,446
I'm sorry you lost yours.

1511
01:36:53,281 --> 01:36:56,117
But maybe, would you want to be
a black swan with us?

1512
01:37:02,123 --> 01:37:03,656
Can I be a purple one?

1513
01:37:03,658 --> 01:37:05,491
Deal.

1514
01:37:05,493 --> 01:37:08,296
I would like that very much.

1515
01:37:16,538 --> 01:37:18,571
I don't want
the creepy little runt.

1516
01:37:18,573 --> 01:37:20,273
Think I want him?

1517
01:37:20,275 --> 01:37:21,607
You know what, fellas?

1518
01:37:21,609 --> 01:37:24,312
I don't really want to play
anyways.

1519
01:37:25,446 --> 01:37:26,646
Ball to the face

1520
01:37:26,648 --> 01:37:28,449
at a very high-speed pace.

1521
01:37:30,885 --> 01:37:32,585
What?!

1522
01:37:35,290 --> 01:37:36,355
Lucky shot.

1523
01:37:36,357 --> 01:37:38,291
We want Lewis on our team.

1524
01:37:38,293 --> 01:37:40,192
- No, we want him.
- No!

1525
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:50,736
Rose Rita, right?

1526
01:37:50,738 --> 01:37:52,204
Mm-hmm.

1527
01:37:52,206 --> 01:37:53,906
Can I see your bug book?

1528
01:37:53,908 --> 01:37:55,608
I've seen you
with your dictionary.

1529
01:37:55,610 --> 01:37:58,277
You know the word is "insect."

1530
01:37:58,279 --> 01:38:00,114
But sure.

1531
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:06,485
Wow.

1532
01:38:06,487 --> 01:38:08,154
You drew these?

1533
01:38:08,156 --> 01:38:09,390
These are really good.

1534
01:38:12,427 --> 01:38:14,427
You look like an insect.

1535
01:38:14,429 --> 01:38:16,531
I mean that as
the highest compliment.

1536
01:38:19,634 --> 01:38:21,402
That's how I take it.

1537
01:38:28,242 --> 01:38:30,209
- Bye.
- Bye.

1538
01:38:30,211 --> 01:38:31,444
Who was that?

1539
01:38:31,446 --> 01:38:33,346
Rose Rita Pottinger.
She's a friend.

1540
01:38:33,348 --> 01:38:34,513
She is?

1541
01:38:34,515 --> 01:38:36,382
- Is it kissy-faced?
- No, platonic.

1542
01:38:36,384 --> 01:38:39,385
Look at him playing it cool...
James Dean all of a sudden.

1543
01:38:43,491 --> 01:38:45,458
Uncle Jonathan, punch it.

1544
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:47,460
Let's see
what this baby can do.

1545
01:39:01,209 --> 01:39:02,708
- Hi! We're home!
- Oh!

1546
01:39:05,647 --> 01:39:07,380
- You ready?
- Oh, yeah.

1547
01:39:07,382 --> 01:39:09,615
Stay.

1548
01:39:09,617 --> 01:39:12,284
You know, Jonathan,
you drive like an old grandma.

1549
01:39:12,286 --> 01:39:13,719
Oh, that's funny.
You look like one.

1550
01:39:13,721 --> 01:39:16,422
Guys, stop.
You're both super old.

1551
01:39:16,424 --> 01:39:18,224
Nice one, Lewis.

1552
01:39:18,226 --> 01:39:19,661
Gold star.

1553
01:39:25,833 --> 01:39:27,633
Bad kitty!

1554
01:39:27,635 --> 01:39:29,502
Use the litter box!

1555
