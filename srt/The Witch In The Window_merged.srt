1
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:43,106
Bedtime's 10:30,

2
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,151
no matter what he says.

3
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:50,180
And, oh vegetables, can't go
six weeks on pizza, okay?

4
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:52,724
And you remember
he's allergic to

5
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:54,595
shellfish? To shellfish, I know.

6
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:57,250
It's Vermont, people don't
go for the oysters.

7
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:59,513
I can't believe you're
going to Vermont.

8
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:02,473
I couldn't drag you there when
we were married, I tried.

9
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:05,171
You did.

10
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:07,391
You're not flipping
again, right?

11
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,765
No, it's just over and
out, six weeks tops.

12
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,769
Is there a rule for
phone time for Finn?

13
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:16,443
You're kidding right?

14
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:18,663
After his latest stunt?

15
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:23,668
His phone time is zero, the
phone stays in New York.

16
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:26,149
I hate you. Finn,
you cannot talk.

17
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:27,280
Calm down, I'll talk to him.
To your mother...

18
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:29,326
What? Calm down, I'll...

19
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,283
We don't need to do this.

20
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:33,093
Calm down, are you kidding me?

21
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:36,159
You are not here!

22
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:39,360
You have no idea what's
going on here, you don't!

23
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:42,861
I'm just trying
to keep him safe,

24
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:45,061
and I am all alone in this!

25
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:49,650
Up against the internet,
random shootings,

26
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:52,740
other people's bad kids,
the planet dying,

27
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:54,481
and now this President?

28
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:55,917
What am I supposed to...

29
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:57,987
Okay, yeah,

30
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:00,357
go ahead you tell me
what I'm supposed

31
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:01,686
to say to a little boy?

32
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:05,515
I don't know.

33
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:08,998
You're right, I don't know.

34
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:24,405
Hey bucko, it's time to go!

35
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,550
What's the matter?

36
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:48,378
The smell!

37
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:50,380
Oh that's just fresh air.

38
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:52,599
Vermont in May, doesn't
get any fresher.

39
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:54,035
It's cow shit.

40
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:56,864
Yeah, the freshest though.

41
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,586
Dad, don't.

42
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,893
No you're right, let's
sulk, that's more fun.

43
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:08,398
There's nothing here.
You've been banished.

44
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:09,834
People who have been
banished get sent

45
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:12,164
to places where there's
nothing, that's how it works.

46
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:16,493
Look I know this is not
your choice, so already

47
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,519
we're off on the
wrong, you know...

48
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:21,193
I talked to your mother
about what happened,

49
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:23,282
I'm not even going to
go into all that but,

50
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,613
all I know is that I've
never seen her so upset.

51
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:29,704
I just don't want this trip
to be a disappointment.

52
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:32,813
I'm already disappointed.

53
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:34,274
Yeah well, me too.

54
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,601
Why? I guess I was hoping

55
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,081
I'd catch you on
the 12 side of 12,

56
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:41,672
instead of the 13 side of 12.

57
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:50,899
'Cause the kid I used to know,
would have loved this place.

58
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:44,778
Whose house?

59
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,780
I bought it.

60
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:49,784
Wait, it's yours?

61
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:52,676
But didn't someone
else hire you to like

62
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,286
fix it up or something?

63
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,268
Yeah, that's what I
told your mother.

64
00:05:57,487 --> 00:06:00,248
You lied to her?
Yes a little bit,

65
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:02,623
more of a fib really. Why?

66
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,777
'Cause I'm flipping it,
and your mother hates it

67
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,779
when I flip houses, she
thinks it's gambling.

68
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,674
Flipping it like, over?

69
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:15,438
No, it means, you
buy it for cheap,

70
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:19,422
put a little money in it so
it looks nicer, worth more,

71
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:22,445
then you try to sell
it again for a profit.

72
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:25,080
What if it doesn't flip
over and you can't sell it?

73
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,711
It'll flip.

74
00:06:32,957 --> 00:06:35,196
I'm gonna cut my hand off.
That's exactly what

75
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,328
your mother said.

76
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:37,808
Screw her what does she know!

77
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,985
Hey!

78
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,009
Shit.

79
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:46,579
Yeah?

80
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,497
What, oh right,
Rick, the wiring.

81
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:52,585
So what...

82
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:55,129
Uh great, that's great.

83
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:58,742
Yeah I'll leave the
bulkhead open,

84
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:00,202
the fuse box is right in...

85
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,945
Okay, great, do your thing.

86
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:06,251
All right thanks, bye.

87
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,417
Gonna take her side now?

88
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,833
I'm not taking anyone's side.

89
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:25,508
But your mother does
have some valid points,

90
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:27,858
you have to admit. She
broke into my computer.

91
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:29,927
It came with rules,
and you knew that.

92
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:36,736
Dad, imagine the only
thing between you,

93
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,784
and pretty much every answer
to every question you have,

94
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:44,483
right, is a door, you're
not supposed to open,

95
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:46,204
one with a real
crappy lock on it?

96
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:51,688
Wouldn't you break the crappy
lock and at least take a peek?

97
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:58,608
How much of a peek did you take?

98
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:13,773
Tell me people got
chopped up here.

99
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:16,384
I don't know, sorry
to disappoint.

100
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:18,778
That's something they'd
have to disclose.

101
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:20,345
What's disclosed?

102
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:21,694
That means they'd have
to tell me if somebody

103
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,546
got chopped here and
they didn't tell me.

104
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:25,809
Damn.

105
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:29,377
Whoa.

106
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,957
Something smells nasty in here.

107
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:50,114
I'd say when we open the
flue in this thing,

108
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:51,855
we're gonna get a
little present.

109
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,577
What kind of present? A
furry, dead present.

110
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:59,060
Plumbing's not fixed, yet.

111
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:02,411
Let's not fix it.

112
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:04,998
Then you won't try to cook.

113
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:07,871
Oh nice burn. Yeah, nice burn

114
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:10,874
like every food you ever...
Now you lost it.

115
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:13,093
Don't push it, never
double-down on a good burn.

116
00:09:13,117 --> 00:09:15,313
Right. Microwave,

117
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:17,968
number for the pizza
guy, all we need.

118
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,210
All we need.

119
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:26,672
Rain is starting to
come through this guy

120
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:27,784
and rot the wood.

121
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,789
Gonna have to switch those out.

122
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:55,899
Like, for horses.

123
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:59,947
Yeah, there probably was, once.

124
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,560
We should turn this into
something cool like,

125
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:06,388
a movie theater.

126
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,019
Who needs horses?

127
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:11,804
Well your mom had
horses growing up.

128
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:12,849
Really?

129
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:15,025
Yeah, I never much
cared for 'em,

130
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:17,027
but she loved the damn things.

131
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:18,095
Probably still does.

132
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:23,033
Right, she had these
little pictures,

133
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:23,947
Yeah, that she
painted on on her...

134
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,862
The walls, little animals.

135
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:27,975
What, I remember things.

136
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,281
It's been a while but I do.

137
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:45,316
Did you...

138
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,491
Is this my stuff?

139
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:47,884
Yeah.

140
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:49,189
I had some things
sent up from storage.

141
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:50,998
I wanted you to feel
at home I guess.

142
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:54,262
What? Nothing.

143
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:59,939
No you don't feel at home,
it's stupid and you hate it.

144
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:00,984
Look at you, you
totally hate it.

145
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:02,879
Dad, it's just...

146
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:06,926
A little too young.

147
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,688
I asked your mom what
she thought you'd like.

148
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,908
She doesn't know everything.

149
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:13,542
I can't wait to tell her that.

150
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,112
You still like those things?

151
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,027
Sure.

152
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:26,076
I can't do 'em, they
give me a headache.

153
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:31,231
It's kind of like, you
have to look at it,

154
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:33,886
like you're looking at
something far away,

155
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,998
even though it's up close.

156
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:43,658
I can't do it.

157
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:47,968
What's the picture of?
I'm not telling.

158
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:53,669
I'll get you some more
grown up decorations soon.

159
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,084
Maybe a gun closet and
some booby posters.

160
00:11:58,108 --> 00:11:59,108
Whoa easy!

161
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,464
Well here's another wrong
we have to make right.

162
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:10,338
We're the house
doctors, you and me.

163
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,429
Get in there where the bad
parts are and make 'em good.

164
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:18,032
Turn this into some place
someone would want to live.

165
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,838
So these, are the guts.

166
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:20,408
And she's got really bad guts.

167
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,674
Bad pipes, bad wires...

168
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:31,245
And this...

169
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:34,509
This is the heart.

170
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:39,098
Here she's got a bad heart too.

171
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:40,210
It's barely pumping.

172
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Even though I can't find a
single thing wrong with it.
Which is bad news for us
because up here in May
it's cold as balls
and we do not ha...

173
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
, what's happening?
Sh!
Sh!

174
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,211
Jesus Christ the hell are you?

175
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:06,343
Wait wait, wait, wait!

176
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:09,912
Just, the electrician!

177
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:12,218
You said to come in through the
bulkhead and I just thought,

178
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:13,480
sorry, I'm sorry. Jesus Christ!

179
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:16,135
I, died for a second.

180
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,409
Don't even think about it.

181
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,237
Why, you don't even inhale.

182
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,848
I'm not the best
father, but I'm not

183
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,308
trying to win a prize about it.

184
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,180
Better settle for
second-hand, chief!

185
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:42,185
So uh, it's a mess in there.

186
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:46,252
You got broken fuses,
outdated everything.

187
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:48,559
Awesome. Plus you got a main

188
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,909
line clipped on the
outside, but uh,

189
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:51,954
I've already taken care of that.

190
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,303
Wait, clipped?

191
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:56,001
Like someone cut it
clipped, like on purpose?

192
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,025
Looks like.

193
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:00,310
Kids maybe, or uh, I don't know,

194
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,965
but like I said, taken care of.

195
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,488
Thanks.

196
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:06,035
Well this is Finn by the way.

197
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,274
Louis.

198
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:09,972
Hi.

199
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:12,626
I'm also your neighbor,
uh, closest thing you got

200
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,065
out here anyway, about a quarter
mile down South Street.

201
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:19,024
It's a bit far to run for
a stick of butter but uh,

202
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,441
anything you ever need just...

203
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:26,708
Something wrong? No.

204
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:29,730
You mind if we move
up to the porch.

205
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,210
It's getting kind of chilly?

206
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:32,757
I prefer it here actually.

207
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:35,978
You don't much like this place.

208
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:39,590
I, I don't like it no.

209
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:42,418
Why not?

210
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,923
Don't worry, we're not moving
in, we're flipping it over.

211
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,576
I don't know

212
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,274
what they told you already...

213
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:53,580
Just that nobody got chopped up.

214
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:55,171
That's right, boring...

215
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:59,369
So they didn't tell
you about her?

216
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,110
I guess they wouldn't have to.

217
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:02,134
About what?

218
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,313
Lady who lived here
when I was a kid.

219
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:08,402
Um...

220
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:11,404
She died?

221
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:15,254
Yes!

222
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:16,212
Let's see if you're saying that

223
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:17,822
one o'clock in the morning.

224
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:21,913
She was the kind of lady
that kids would call a,

225
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:23,286
witch, or whatever.

226
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,525
But that's normal, it's just the

227
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:28,528
usual small town stuff, right?

228
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:31,425
Uh, cute, or whatever.

229
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:35,298
But this was not cute.

230
00:16:36,473 --> 00:16:39,433
What'd she do? Uh...

231
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,391
Go on.

232
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:47,136
I guess it was a good house
once, back before I was born.

233
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:52,533
But for me it was
always her house.

234
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:58,428
She did have a family back
then, husband and a son but,

235
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:01,498
they died on the farm, badly,

236
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,043
got caught up in the hay bailer.

237
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,872
Nasty stuff.

238
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:10,396
Rumor was it she
done it herself.

239
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,074
Why would she do that?

240
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:19,908
Well, most people I think,
generally try and do good but,

241
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:23,868
this woman was, the other way.

242
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:31,050
But I'll tell you this, she
liked that people were scared.

243
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:35,663
She liked it, being
in your head.

244
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:41,732
And what really scared me, was
seeing how scared my mom was.

245
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:43,647
Now that I got a kid
of my own I get it,

246
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:47,259
she knew something that
bad was that close.

247
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,676
And she couldn't keep me safe.

248
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:53,265
She used to sit, right up there
in the window in the front,

249
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:54,289
just watching.

250
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:57,835
One summer we all got
to noticing that uh,

251
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:59,600
she never seemed to
leave that spot.

252
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:01,731
Day and night.

253
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,736
So finally someone caught
wise and called it in and,

254
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,324
sure enough, she'd been dead

255
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,611
up there, three, four weeks.

256
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,571
I think they said it
was a heart failure.

257
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:18,725
What was her name?

258
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:20,858
What? Her name.

259
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:22,381
You never said it.

260
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:25,626
Ha, I guess I don't
much like saying it.

261
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,934
Her name was, Lydia.

262
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,185
What are those?

263
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,577
Something wrong?

264
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:47,493
Yep, I got a hole in my heart.

265
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,365
Well, obviously.

266
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,368
No really.

267
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:55,197
It's a tiny one, a lot
of people have them.

268
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:56,676
Since when have you had it?

269
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,983
Since forever, but I only
found out about it last year

270
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:00,637
when I was in California.

271
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,073
Can it get bad?

272
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:04,621
It sounds bad, can you die?

273
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:06,860
There's a better chance
of us being hit by

274
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,906
an asteroid while we sleep.

275
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,342
Is it cold in your room?

276
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,431
As balls. Okay there's blankets

277
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,041
next to...

278
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:17,001
Where did you hear that,
did you hear me say that?

279
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:18,394
Yes.

280
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:19,462
Well...

281
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:23,703
Okay there's some extra blankets

282
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:25,052
next to your bed.

283
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:26,600
We'll get on that
furnace tomorrow.

284
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:29,361
I'm next door if you need me.

285
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:30,385
I'm fine.

286
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:33,476
I'll leave my door open.
I'm fine!

287
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

288
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,062
Ah!

289
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:05,283
What is that?

290
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,657
That is a big fat old dead crow.

291
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:14,597
There you go no rush, just
see the line in your head,

292
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,555
and don't think too hard.

293
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:22,846
There you go, nice.

294
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:25,413
Nice.

295
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:43,408
Shit.

296
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:02,645
Who's there?

297
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:33,569
What's with the lamp?

298
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:36,113
Oh nothing.

299
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:37,810
I heard you talking to someone.

300
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,986
Just to myself.

301
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,010
You know...

302
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:44,536
I'm a little uh...

303
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:46,756
Dad.

304
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:48,758
What is it?

305
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:52,762
Do you think there's something
wrong with the house?

306
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:55,721
Maybe.

307
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:57,462
Do you?

308
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,659
I thought I saw someone
in the mirror.

309
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:01,683
What kind of someone?

310
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:03,946
I think a lady.

311
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:06,646
Which mirror?

312
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:11,912
Oh I'm sure it was just...

313
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:17,763
What did she look like?
I don't know, it was

314
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:20,549
too fast, it was
like, a magic eye.

315
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:22,115
A what? You know,

316
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:24,901
the picture in my room, the one
with the crazy patternings?

317
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:27,860
It was kind of like
that, it was like,

318
00:23:27,884 --> 00:23:29,645
you only see it for
a second, then...

319
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:30,670
You lose it.

320
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:37,740
Do you think that it's her?

321
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:39,089
Who?

322
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:42,135
Lydia! Why are you whispering?

323
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,159
I don't know.

324
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:46,729
Have you seen something too?

325
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,079
What?

326
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:54,823
That's the spot.

327
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,658
Do you think it's the
same chair she died in?

328
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,507
No of course not.

329
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,537
You want to leave?

330
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,061
Well maybe we should though.

331
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:16,237
I'm not scared.

332
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:20,739
You want to sleep in my room?

333
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:22,243
You don't have to be brave.

334
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:25,638
I said I'm not scared.
I know, but...

335
00:24:27,944 --> 00:24:30,270
I'll leave my door open.

336
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:31,948
Dad. Just in case.

337
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:13,659
Time to get up bucko.

338
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:15,965
Not yet.

339
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:20,317
I-I had this dream.

340
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:25,385
It's still coming back to me uh,

341
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:28,301
I was asking someone
if we could stay here.

342
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:33,156
Stay? I asked her, who was it?

343
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:36,899
Wait... Like with mom too?

344
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:39,878
Oh god I remember now!

345
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:41,401
Lydia!

346
00:26:41,425 --> 00:26:42,425
It was Lydia!

347
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,321
And then, then she showed me
what would happen to you...

348
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:49,477
You just...

349
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:54,961
Dad?

350
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:49,493
Hey Finn will you give
me a hand with this?

351
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:52,148
Finn! What?

352
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:54,736
We're gonna pick this
up and carry it back

353
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,239
to the house, okay? Okay.

354
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:00,504
One, two, three up!

355
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:12,603
You seem quiet, everything okay?

356
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:16,018
I'm fine.

357
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,759
Hey there's some mud up ahead.

358
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:19,219
All right we'll go around it.

359
00:28:21,264 --> 00:28:22,875
You know I've been meaning to...

360
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:26,332
If you want to talk about
anything you saw when you

361
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:28,987
took your little you know,
peek at the world wide web...

362
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:31,076
Please, no, I'm fine.

363
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,556
We don't need to talk
about this right now.

364
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,905
Mmm I'm just saying maybe
there might be some

365
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:35,428
things I can set the
record straight on,

366
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:37,735
because there's a lot of
stuff out there that can

367
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,956
give you the...

368
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,633
All right, okay I got!

369
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:47,595
Thank you.

370
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:58,016
Oh, no... Wait I
thought you said you

371
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,671
walked around this?
Yeah I tried but

372
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:02,499
there's just way too much...
Okay stop no no no

373
00:29:02,523 --> 00:29:03,805
this is bad, back up!

374
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:05,371
Finn, wait ah...

375
00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:08,113
My foot's stuck!
All right hold on.

376
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:11,638
Where's your, you got your boot?

377
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:16,121
All my clothes...

378
00:29:34,076 --> 00:29:36,576
So did you look at
that kind of stuff?

379
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,778
What kind of stuff?
Like on the internet?

380
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:44,106
Thought you didn't want
to talk about that?

381
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,238
Just, never mind...

382
00:29:46,262 --> 00:29:49,091
No no it's just, it's, look...

383
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:52,854
It's perfectly normal to want
to look at girls, or boys

384
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:54,551
or whatever... No oh my god Dad

385
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:55,552
not that kind of stuff!

386
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:58,100
I just mean like scarier stuff.

387
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:02,801
Wait did you see
something violent?

388
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:09,372
Did you see someone get killed?

389
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:14,987
Where did you see that?

390
00:30:16,162 --> 00:30:20,185
The news, I think, it
was just this guy,

391
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:22,492
and he was getting his
head chopped off,

392
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:25,408
and he was screaming, or
at least trying to...

393
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:27,236
God dammit!

394
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,934
God dammit!

395
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:32,874
Jesus!

396
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:35,267
Look Finn...

397
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:40,273
The world's kind of a
sick place I guess.

398
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:44,276
Jesus...

399
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:46,496
Here help me with this thing.

400
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,697
Did you ask your mom about it?

401
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:54,721
Well...

402
00:30:57,377 --> 00:31:00,859
I think so, she was
just really mad, and,

403
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,317
it was really late, I
was supposed to be

404
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:08,605
sleeping but I, snuck out.

405
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:12,194
Only because she was crying.

406
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:15,066
She was on the phone
with someone crying,

407
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,547
and, I don't know
who it was, but,

408
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:21,029
she said she was scared
that I knew that the

409
00:31:21,053 --> 00:31:26,014
world had gone all bad and
that it would end and, die.

410
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:29,016
Why your mom...

411
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:34,196
I, I guess that's
what she thinks.

412
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:38,200
She needs to get out of
the city, you both do.

413
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:44,226
Do you think, that
the world will...

414
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,250
No.

415
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,558
Would you tell me if you did?

416
00:31:51,822 --> 00:31:53,172
No, probably not.

417
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:56,349
You'd lie? Yeah.

418
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,919
So, I'm not allowed
to lie but you are?

419
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:03,007
Yep.

420
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,274
And mom? All the time she lies.

421
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:10,536
My god!

422
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:13,995
Do you feel bad about it?

423
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:19,024
Mph, all parents do it,
good ones, crappy ones.

424
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:22,679
We tell you everything's
okay when it's not okay.

425
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:26,335
We tell you we're strong
when we're not strong.

426
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:29,271
We'll tell you there's
no spinach in it

427
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:31,360
when there's spinach in it.

428
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:32,384
I knew it.

429
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:37,477
Anything, so you don't know...

430
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:40,827
Don't know what?

431
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:50,490
That you aren't
safe, not really.

432
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:57,777
More, more more!

433
00:32:57,801 --> 00:33:00,674
What else did you lie
about you lying liar?

434
00:33:02,154 --> 00:33:05,263
Okay so, remember that
automatic dog feeder thing

435
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:08,334
you made for the science
fair all those years ago?

436
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:12,183
I said it was great and
you were so clever?

437
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:15,012
Yeah?

438
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,709
Well that thing was terrible.

439
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,059
It never worked,

440
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,694
the dog hated it, so,

441
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,979
even though you are pretty
much the cleverest,

442
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,309
that time you were
very unclever.

443
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:32,358
So we pretended,
I mean, we lied.

444
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:40,357
Right keep pushing, keep
pushing, pull straight down.

445
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:45,458
Steady, eh, perfect!

446
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,940
You mad?

447
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:55,468
From now on no bullshit
between us, okay?

448
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,385
No bullshit.

449
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:02,692
Are you really gonna
sell the house?

450
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:09,458
Why would you even think...

451
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:12,156
Do you... No see
that's bullshit!

452
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,376
No no that's, that's stalling,
stalling's different.

453
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,445
Stalling to think of
the right bullshit.

454
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:19,144
Are you really gonna sell it?

455
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:25,672
I hope not to, that's
the best I can...

456
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
How did you even know?
I don't know,
it's just everything,
like, my room,
and all this stuff and,
all the time in this...

457
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:50,740
Did someone come in?

458
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:13,913
Do you think that...

459
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:15,983
That sounds like it
came from the basement.

460
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:18,289
You okay?

461
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:20,029
Let's go see.

462
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:27,231
You should go
outside and wait...

463
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:28,517
Let's go see!

464
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:35,805
What?

465
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:36,829
Do you feel that?

466
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:38,744
A breeze?

467
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,574
It's hot air. So?

468
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:44,403
That means the heat's on.

469
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,125
I don't believe it.

470
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:22,397
Well, I guess it's a good thing.

471
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:28,162
But, how'd it go on?

472
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:36,561
You know what?

473
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:37,585
We skipped lunch.

474
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:40,261
What do you say we
get out of here,

475
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:42,437
go get some fresh air and maybe,

476
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:43,960
go to the pizza
instead of inviting

477
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:45,420
the pizza here for a change?

478
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,448
Go wash up, and grab
your rain coat.

479
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:07,877
Ow, Jesus!

480
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:12,510
Dad! Hold on a second.

481
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:13,666
Dad! What?

482
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:19,192
Her.

483
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:40,954
What should we do?

484
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:51,442
Stay here.

485
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:10,679
Excuse me...

486
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:28,609
Excuse me Miss?

487
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:33,659
I can see you.

488
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:46,715
Go outside.

489
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:51,067
Go downstairs Finn, now!

490
00:39:25,754 --> 00:39:30,759
What the hell...

491
00:40:02,661 --> 00:40:03,705
Hello?

492
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:07,274
Say her name.

493
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Lydia.

494
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:26,424
I don't think...

495
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:27,989
Stay!

496
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:02,583
All right I'm doing this.
What, no!

497
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:03,608
Dad don't!

498
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:10,025
Hi hey there Bev. I
was just thinking

499
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:11,461
about you two.

500
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:13,681
Uh so listen I'm gonna,

501
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:16,771
tell you the longer version of
this sometime real soon but,

502
00:42:16,795 --> 00:42:18,623
something's happened. Jesus.

503
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,104
Is he hurt? Just listen.

504
00:42:23,323 --> 00:42:25,847
I'm putting Finn on the
bus in the morning,

505
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:28,783
to you, back to New York.

506
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:30,611
Oh no Dad please! He'll
be at Port Authority

507
00:42:30,635 --> 00:42:33,744
by 3:30, look I'm
sorry, this is not the

508
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:35,509
way I wanted this to happen but,

509
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,403
conditions just aren't
safe in the house and I,

510
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:43,430
I, I don't know how
to make them safe I,

511
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:47,652
I don't, I'm sorry.

512
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:50,871
Okay.

513
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:53,221
Okay?

514
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:55,703
What else am I gonna say?

515
00:42:57,749 --> 00:42:58,749
Thank you.

516
00:43:01,056 --> 00:43:04,122
I'll text you details in the
morning once he's on the road.

517
00:43:04,146 --> 00:43:06,758
- Okay bye.
- Bye.

518
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,004
Come on don't look
at me like that.

519
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:18,006
What do you expect me to do, ,

520
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,398
what if something happened?

521
00:43:19,422 --> 00:43:20,422
How would I...

522
00:43:22,295 --> 00:43:23,881
Do you want to go back in there?

523
00:43:23,905 --> 00:43:25,230
No...

524
00:43:25,254 --> 00:43:27,581
I don't know. Well so then what?

525
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,713
Wha, we can't both leave
as much as I'd love that

526
00:43:29,737 --> 00:43:32,174
but bucko, I'm all in.

527
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:35,003
I bet the house
literally, and...

528
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:37,199
Look I know you don't
understand this...

529
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:39,810
Let's both stay then!
Absolutely not!

530
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:41,333
It could be the best house,

531
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:42,639
you know that mom would love it!

532
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:43,988
That's what I thought
when I first saw it.

533
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:46,275
Finn, no.

534
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:53,171
So what, you're gonna
sell it to someone?

535
00:43:53,195 --> 00:43:56,827
Just lie, give it to
some poor family...

536
00:43:56,851 --> 00:43:58,394
I don't know, please!

537
00:43:58,418 --> 00:44:01,963
You shouldn't go in alone,
it's worse if you go in alone.

538
00:44:01,987 --> 00:44:04,424
Please Dad! I won't
sleep in there.

539
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:08,994
I'll work during the day,
and I'll crash at a motel.

540
00:44:10,038 --> 00:44:11,038
I'll be fine.

541
00:44:12,737 --> 00:44:14,628
I know how to survive
living for a couple weeks

542
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,045
with someone who doesn't
want me there, believe me.

543
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:19,981
Didn't you hear her?

544
00:44:20,005 --> 00:44:21,112
Who?

545
00:44:21,136 --> 00:44:22,136
Lydia?

546
00:44:23,443 --> 00:44:25,967
She doesn't want you out,
she wants you to stay.

547
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:31,949
Well then we'll get
along fine, her and me,

548
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:33,975
'cause that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

549
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:56,910
Hey.

550
00:44:58,086 --> 00:44:59,914
Come on, I'll show you my room.

551
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,990
You and I got tot
get on the level

552
00:45:13,014 --> 00:45:14,102
with a few things.

553
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:16,975
Well, have we not
been on the level?

554
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,150
Nope.

555
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,500
Not really.

556
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:26,811
You know that first
day I come over,

557
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:30,791
told you about the
wire's been clipped,

558
00:45:30,815 --> 00:45:32,033
and the power had gone dead.

559
00:45:33,818 --> 00:45:34,818
It was me cut 'em.

560
00:45:36,081 --> 00:45:37,125
What, you?

561
00:45:40,128 --> 00:45:41,128
Why?

562
00:45:42,087 --> 00:45:44,698
I cut 'em four or
five years back uh,

563
00:45:46,308 --> 00:45:48,615
something didn't
seem right and...

564
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:53,533
I seen her looking out.

565
00:45:55,013 --> 00:45:56,536
So you've... Off and on.

566
00:45:57,929 --> 00:45:59,234
Through the years, yeah.

567
00:46:01,671 --> 00:46:05,110
Didn't, more than sort of
spook me at first but,

568
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:11,832
then I noticed, a few
days after I'd seen her,

569
00:46:11,856 --> 00:46:16,556
that she'd seen me that,
things weren't right,

570
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:19,472
in, with my head and um,

571
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:23,171
the worst of it was
the sleep walking.

572
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:25,172
Sleep walking?

573
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:31,614
I'd wake up in the road
between our houses,

574
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:34,356
just standing there and...

575
00:46:36,532 --> 00:46:39,076
It seemed like every time
I'd be like a step closer,

576
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,100
like she was just,

577
00:46:41,189 --> 00:46:43,452
trying to reel me in or
something, you know.

578
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,565
And then uh, this one time
there was this ice storm,

579
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:52,002
that knocked the grid
down for a week.

580
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:55,029
But I'm sure she was still in
there but I didn't see her.

581
00:46:56,204 --> 00:46:59,425
And I slept, stopped
taking my walks.

582
00:47:01,557 --> 00:47:04,996
I got to thinking, maybe
she liked the power on.

583
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:09,043
So I, I cut it.

584
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:14,527
And then I had you repair it.

585
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,835
Cursing myself the whole time.

586
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:22,728
But I knew it would get done,
with me or without me,

587
00:47:22,752 --> 00:47:25,973
so I figured, I might
as well be the one.

588
00:47:27,627 --> 00:47:28,976
At least I could warn you.

589
00:47:31,283 --> 00:47:33,285
But I didn't, 'cause
I'm chickenshit.

590
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:37,071
And uh I don't know
I guess I just,

591
00:47:38,899 --> 00:47:42,163
hoping it all been in my drunken
god damn skull, you know?

592
00:47:43,773 --> 00:47:45,297
Is that what you think now?

593
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:50,476
Today I woke up, 3:30 in
the god damn morning,

594
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:53,305
at the head of your driveway.

595
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:58,764
You can't keep doing what
you're doing over there.

596
00:47:58,788 --> 00:47:59,788
I have to.

597
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:02,269
What, for money?

598
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:08,189
That's all she ever dreamed
of, the perfect country home.

599
00:48:09,712 --> 00:48:14,195
It's old and eccentric, full of
history, and strange noises.

600
00:48:15,153 --> 00:48:16,328
Room for horses.

601
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,680
You're not flipping it?
I was never flipping.

602
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,162
I was keeping it, god damn it!

603
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,708
To surprise her or
to, convince her,

604
00:48:29,732 --> 00:48:32,276
I don't know, anything
to get her...

605
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,345
She love you?

606
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,134
If not well then,

607
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:48,229
that's something you can't flip.

608
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,860
Trust me. At least I'd have

609
00:48:50,884 --> 00:48:52,993
done something good, for them.

610
00:48:53,017 --> 00:48:55,473
You've seen the house now you
know it's Lydia's house,

611
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:57,214
not yours, and it's a bad house!

612
00:48:57,238 --> 00:48:59,869
You said yourself, it
was a good house once.

613
00:48:59,893 --> 00:49:01,871
I have to think it can
be a good house again.

614
00:49:01,895 --> 00:49:03,244
I am telling you... Don't!

615
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,224
She can scare the hell out
of me if she wants to,

616
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:08,946
but what is she
gonna do to me huh?

617
00:49:11,122 --> 00:49:14,231
We're adults, we know
in the real world,

618
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:16,103
nobody fills in a
death certificate,

619
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:18,042
cause of death, haunted house!

620
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:28,052
I just know that, whatever you
fix in that god damn house,

621
00:49:29,314 --> 00:49:33,318
all you're really doing,
is making her stronger.

622
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:47,593
I love you.

623
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:34,133
All right.

624
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:24,549
Are you mad?

625
00:53:25,985 --> 00:53:27,267
Yes.

626
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,640
You can't just...

627
00:53:30,468 --> 00:53:32,034
When did you get off the bus?

628
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:35,821
Right there, just when you left.

629
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:41,063
Well then you... What?

630
00:53:41,087 --> 00:53:42,087
Jesus Finn!

631
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:50,115
Are you gonna help then?

632
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:52,292
I am helping. You are.

633
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:53,316
I'm the lookout.

634
00:54:02,413 --> 00:54:03,781
Look at this huh?

635
00:54:03,805 --> 00:54:04,805
Teamwork!

636
00:54:08,593 --> 00:54:11,093
I love your pout, I
think it's funny.

637
00:54:11,117 --> 00:54:12,747
Maybe if you let me s...
You're a New Yorker again

638
00:54:12,771 --> 00:54:16,490
by tomorrow afternoon, no debate,
don't even think about it.

639
00:54:16,514 --> 00:54:17,926
You and I are not gonna strap on

640
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:20,233
proton packs and try to
save the whole god damn...

641
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,519
Shut up! Hey!

642
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:24,042
Watch it!

643
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,478
I know what you're thinking.

644
00:54:48,502 --> 00:54:50,591
No, you really don't.

645
00:54:51,505 --> 00:54:52,550
I'm an asshole.

646
00:54:53,812 --> 00:54:57,182
You're wrong. I am?

647
00:54:57,206 --> 00:54:58,206
Yes.

648
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,645
You're my favorite person.

649
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:07,739
Even if maybe I don't admit
it all the time it's just,

650
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:13,919
you know, and I always want
to be mad at you because,

651
00:55:14,746 --> 00:55:16,617
I guess Mom always is so...

652
00:55:17,836 --> 00:55:19,751
Really, you're my
favorite person.

653
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:25,646
My favorite person
doesn't like me enough,

654
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:27,933
to just, stick around you know?

655
00:55:39,727 --> 00:55:40,922
Finn you and your mother
mean more to me...

656
00:55:40,946 --> 00:55:42,663
Don't say that!

657
00:55:42,687 --> 00:55:44,384
No bullshit remember?

658
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,650
If that were true then why
would you keep leaving?

659
00:55:50,825 --> 00:55:52,044
Because I'm a coward.

660
00:55:54,002 --> 00:55:57,678
It's just, Jesus Finn you...

661
00:55:57,702 --> 00:56:00,768
It's all so scary
you have no idea.

662
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:04,554
Feeling like, I have this
completely perfect thing,

663
00:56:04,578 --> 00:56:07,276
'cause that's how I feel
about you, just perfect.

664
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:11,648
And why in the hell
would anyone, give me a

665
00:56:11,672 --> 00:56:14,651
perfect god damn thing when
they should know that,

666
00:56:14,675 --> 00:56:16,373
all I've got are
ways to wreck it?

667
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:21,378
And so I panic, and
I can't keep still.

668
00:56:23,205 --> 00:56:25,686
And as horrible as it
feels to miss you guys,

669
00:56:26,644 --> 00:56:30,363
it also feels like,
being missed is better

670
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,582
than being there
and being hated.

671
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:35,174
I wouldn't Dad, I love you.

672
00:56:42,224 --> 00:56:43,356
I love you too Finn!

673
00:56:50,145 --> 00:56:51,819
Oh Jesus.

674
00:56:51,843 --> 00:56:53,298
It's your mother. No!

675
00:56:53,322 --> 00:56:54,865
Don't answer it!

676
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:57,607
Bev? Hi.

677
00:56:57,631 --> 00:56:58,913
I thought I'd check in.

678
00:56:58,937 --> 00:57:01,742
Um, I don't know what
Finn's already told you.

679
00:57:01,766 --> 00:57:03,308
Um, not much.

680
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:05,683
He's been pretty quiet since
he got back actually.

681
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:08,642
Since, what? Finn.

682
00:57:10,035 --> 00:57:13,342
He's been pretty quiet
since he got back today.

683
00:57:14,909 --> 00:57:17,888
Back where? Back home.

684
00:57:17,912 --> 00:57:20,804
You put him on a bus...

685
00:57:20,828 --> 00:57:23,546
What am I not understanding?

686
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,224
You're saying... Are you okay?

687
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,160
I picked him up at Port
Authority just like you asked,

688
00:57:29,184 --> 00:57:31,796
he's eating mac and cheese
right now not 10 feet away.

689
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:36,844
Put him on. Okay, one sec.

690
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:41,544
Dad?

691
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:46,787
Well hey bucko. You okay?

692
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:49,659
Yeah no, no worries,
all's good, I'm a,

693
00:57:49,683 --> 00:57:50,747
I'm glad you got home safe.

694
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:52,836
You don't sound okay.

695
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,296
No worries.

696
00:57:55,602 --> 00:57:56,995
I'll check in on you tomorrow.

697
00:57:58,344 --> 00:57:59,582
Okay. I love you.

698
00:57:59,606 --> 00:58:01,105
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

699
00:58:25,676 --> 00:58:26,676
Stay!

700
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,820
Oh shit!

701
00:59:05,846 --> 00:59:07,128
What do you want?

702
00:59:07,152 --> 00:59:08,632
Please, is your dad here?

703
00:59:14,768 --> 00:59:17,989
Jesus, Louis. I'm real sorry,

704
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:20,295
to see you like this.

705
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:24,822
Louis I, I don't even
know where to begin.

706
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,584
So tie one on with me eh?

707
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:30,717
Louis I don't need a
beer, I need help!

708
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:32,370
I need you, your phone,
or maybe your truck!

709
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:35,896
I can't give you any
of those things, I-I,

710
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,898
I can't help you at all.

711
00:59:37,922 --> 00:59:39,987
Why not? Because in order

712
00:59:40,011 --> 00:59:42,666
for me to help you, you would
have had to have left.

713
00:59:43,928 --> 00:59:45,843
Left what? Your house.

714
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,778
You never did.

715
00:59:48,802 --> 00:59:51,476
I never...

716
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,025
You never left, your house!

717
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Hey!

718
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,623
Hey!

719
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:53,084
Simon?

720
01:00:56,957 --> 01:01:00,633
I, I had to come, something in
your voice, what's going on?

721
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,851
Please.

722
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:03,747
What? Please just, just stop it!

723
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:06,813
Please don't make
me look at her.

724
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:08,403
What the hell is going on?

725
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,625
Look at me!

726
01:01:25,594 --> 01:01:26,594
Fuck you!

727
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:30,053
Would you like to leave?

728
01:01:30,077 --> 01:01:32,036
It's impossible, I
get it, I know.

729
01:01:33,428 --> 01:01:34,428
You can.

730
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:37,191
No obstacles, no
trick, I promise.

731
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:39,521
I don't believe you. It's true.

732
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:43,569
You can walk right back
out into the world.

733
01:01:46,137 --> 01:01:50,576
Abandon the job, beg
for another loan.

734
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:53,753
Your family stays
in their hellhole.

735
01:01:56,277 --> 01:01:57,277
You leave.

736
01:02:00,107 --> 01:02:01,761
You leave them again.

737
01:02:11,858 --> 01:02:12,858
Or I could stay.

738
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,600
Yes.

739
01:02:17,342 --> 01:02:19,015
Stay like you stayed?

740
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:20,039
Yes.

741
01:02:21,868 --> 01:02:23,174
And be with you. No.

742
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,876
You must do this
alone, as I did.

743
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:36,709
And where would you go?

744
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:39,319
Free.

745
01:03:26,019 --> 01:03:27,020
I'll stay.

746
01:03:38,075 --> 01:03:41,165
But I have to finish
the job first.

747
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,719
So you finally call back?

748
01:04:37,743 --> 01:04:40,548
Sorry, work's been hard,

749
01:04:40,572 --> 01:04:42,182
I kind of disappeared in it.

750
01:04:43,488 --> 01:04:46,119
Finn won't stop
asking about you.

751
01:04:46,143 --> 01:04:49,146
He's, been having bad dreams.

752
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,149
Are you okay? Fine.

753
01:04:53,498 --> 01:04:57,086
I saw the house Simon, Finn
had photos on his phone

754
01:04:57,110 --> 01:05:01,549
and he has to let me into his
phone now, we made a deal, so,

755
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:03,682
I saw it. And?

756
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:12,014
And, I knew

757
01:05:12,038 --> 01:05:14,258
exactly what you're up to.

758
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:17,869
And?

759
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:26,052
And, it was a real
nice thought Simon.

760
01:05:27,053 --> 01:05:28,228
I love that you thought it.

761
01:05:33,364 --> 01:05:34,364
Okay.

762
01:05:36,367 --> 01:05:38,847
Look I I'm sorry it's late.

763
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:41,153
But...

764
01:05:43,243 --> 01:05:44,873
Well is Finn up?

765
01:05:44,897 --> 01:05:47,310
Can I... He's asleep.

766
01:05:47,334 --> 01:05:48,335
It's after 11.

767
01:05:50,468 --> 01:05:52,881
Oh, is it? Well, you want me

768
01:05:52,905 --> 01:05:53,905
to wake him?

769
01:05:54,863 --> 01:05:57,233
Well, if you... Actually,
you know what,

770
01:05:57,257 --> 01:05:59,148
he's been through a lot.

771
01:05:59,172 --> 01:06:01,174
I-I should probably just...
Let him sleep.

772
01:06:03,394 --> 01:06:04,394
That's the best thing.

773
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,700
I think so.

774
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:10,227
Tell him I love him.

775
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:12,358
I'll tell him.

776
01:06:13,578 --> 01:06:15,188
Goodnight Simon. Goodnight Bev.

777
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,060
Love you.

778
01:06:18,757 --> 01:06:22,152
Okay...

779
01:06:50,397 --> 01:06:54,053
Okay.

780
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,379
No...

781
01:08:18,964 --> 01:08:22,030
This is so like this
picture I showed him.

782
01:08:22,054 --> 01:08:24,535
Your painting I know,
I hate that painting.

783
01:08:35,023 --> 01:08:36,610
That's really weird, I
was just looking at that

784
01:08:36,634 --> 01:08:38,462
a few weeks ago
after the funeral.

785
01:08:40,028 --> 01:08:42,355
For some reason I
went looking for it.

786
01:08:42,379 --> 01:08:44,120
It's ours now, right?

787
01:08:45,425 --> 01:08:47,775
Yeah well, it's ours
for the moment.

788
01:08:49,081 --> 01:08:52,278
But, we'll sell it
soon, don't worry.

789
01:08:52,302 --> 01:08:54,521
No one expects us to
live in a house where...

790
01:08:55,827 --> 01:08:57,196
That would just feel...

791
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,656
I'm scared to go in.

792
01:09:01,224 --> 01:09:02,573
Yeah me too a little.

793
01:09:04,836 --> 01:09:07,752
Hey why don't you wait
in here then, okay?

794
01:09:09,057 --> 01:09:10,339
I'll go gather some
stuff and we can go

795
01:09:10,363 --> 01:09:12,602
back to the motel. No.

796
01:09:12,626 --> 01:09:13,626
I'm coming in.

797
01:09:33,517 --> 01:09:38,522
Oh Simon...

798
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,540
I keep wondering if he never
even met that doctor.

799
01:09:59,586 --> 01:10:00,935
Never knew where he...

800
01:10:15,341 --> 01:10:16,840
He said there was a
better chance of

801
01:10:16,864 --> 01:10:18,214
being hit by an asteroid.

802
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:21,955
Yeah.

803
01:10:23,131 --> 01:10:24,131
Well...

804
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:30,226
They have to hit
somewhere, don't they?

805
01:10:32,706 --> 01:10:33,706
I guess so.

806
01:11:42,428 --> 01:11:43,428
Hey.

807
01:11:50,784 --> 01:11:51,916
And it's amazing.

808
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:58,009
It doesn't feel bad in here
like I thought it would.

809
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:01,317
No, it doesn't.

810
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:05,669
I like how it feels.

811
01:12:18,029 --> 01:12:19,204
Do you miss the city?

812
01:12:22,599 --> 01:12:23,687
Not one dime.

813
01:12:43,315 --> 01:12:46,013
And where would you go?

814
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:48,407
Free!

815
01:13:47,771 --> 01:13:49,816
It's the strangest thing.

816
01:13:52,732 --> 01:13:55,256
I'm getting kind of used to it.

817
01:13:57,476 --> 01:13:58,825
Uh-hmm...

818
01:14:01,915 --> 01:14:03,439
Sleep tight.

819
01:14:09,706 --> 01:14:12,685
I'll leave my door open.
Goodnight Mom!

820
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:14,101
Goodnight.

821
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:31,467
Goodnight Dad.
