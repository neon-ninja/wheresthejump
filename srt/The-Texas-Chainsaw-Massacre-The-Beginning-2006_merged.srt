1
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,031
Boss, I need
a bathroom break!

2
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,968
Please.

3
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,472
Dear Lord, help me!

4
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,329
Get the hell
out of here.

5
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Well, that's what you get
for drinking on the job, Sloane.
Hey, Sloane, take it easy!

6
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:28,510
Sloane! Sloane!
Damn it! Sloane!

7
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,110
You can do it!

8
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:40,723
Sloane.
Sloane.

9
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,268
Uhh...

10
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,898
Dear God help us.

11
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,687
# Hush, little baby,
don't say a word #

12
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,216
# Mama's gonna buy you... #

13
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:53,063
He's so beautiful.

14
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,201
That's the ugliest thing
I ever saw.

15
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,219
Don't worry about it, Tommy.

16
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:51,417
You don't have to look pretty
to work down at the slaughterhouse.

17
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,184
What is that diseased freak
still doing out here?

18
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,451
We closed for good now.

19
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,720
Uh, I think
he likes it here, sir.

20
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,956
Ain't no reason for that
ugly beast to still be here.

21
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,454
Jess, we need to get that oversized
retard the hell out of here.

22
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,827
We, sir?

23
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,097
Just you.

24
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,215
Hello, Hewitt.

25
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,615
We're shutting down
the place today.

26
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,282
You know that
'cause I done told you.

27
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,314
Shutting down for good.

28
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,521
We ain't packing
no more meat.

29
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,962
Ain't killing
no more animals so...

30
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:51,360
you just leave the equipment.
You just get on home now, okay?

31
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:57,365
You gotta go, I said!

32
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,970
You gotta get the hell out
of here, you dumb animal!

33
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,240
What are you doing?

34
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:45,255
Shh! Keep your voice down.

35
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,418
This is how you
sneak up on 'em,

36
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,395
- how you catch 'em.
- Catch who?

37
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:55,058
Gooks in the swamp.

38
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,592
Eric, the only thing you're
gonna catch in this water is disease.

39
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,667
- Chrissie, come on.
- No, I'm not going in that water.

40
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,198
Consider it the last
wish of a soldier.

41
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,040
Oh, no.

42
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,013
No, you've been getting last wishes
this whole past week, G.I. Joe.

43
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,245
And you call
yourself a patriot.

44
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,378
- You know what I think is patriotic?
- What?

45
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,789
Me driving you across
state to go to Vietnam. Again.

46
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,086
You goin' all the way
to Vietnam, baby?

47
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,321
No, honey, base camp's
far enough for me, trust me.

48
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,357
Just try to relax, baby,

49
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,836
'cause today I'm
going to use my tongue

50
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,963
in ways the Lord
never intended.

51
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,065
- How's that sound?
- Okay.

52
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,668
# All right now #

53
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:43,045
# Baby,
it's all right now #

54
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,447
# Whoa... #

55
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,542
Mmm...

56
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,578
# Let me tell you now #

57
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:57,855
# I took her home
to my place #

58
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,024
# Watching every move
on her face... #

59
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,591
This may come as a shock
to you, but most men

60
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,762
are into this
kind of thing.

61
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,267
I'm sorry.

62
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,472
I'm just a little distracted, Bail.

63
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,447
I mean, I just
keep thinking,

64
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,475
how does a person
go back there?

65
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,214
You know,
how do you do that?

66
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,314
It doesn't make him any more
heroic than you, baby, okay?

67
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,852
Yeah, but he thinks I'm
going with him, Bail.

68
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:34,127
Eric thinks I'm going
to Vietnam with him.

69
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,897
Well, he's your brother,
he loves you.

70
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,963
You know, he'll
get over it, okay?

71
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,377
Just close your eyes.

72
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,381
Let me see your hand.

73
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,508
You're gonna love this.

74
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,040
Can I look?

75
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,076
Yeah.

76
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,751
Eric, you got that
from a Cracker Jack box!

77
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,522
Wha... I... I had to eat
17 batches to find the one I wanted.

78
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,431
How many?

79
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,492
- Two.
- Okay, girls or boys?

80
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,096
One of each.

81
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,572
And what are
their names?

82
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:18,134
- Bonnie and Clyde.
- No.

83
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,873
- Come on.
- Bobby and Janis.

84
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,643
And where are
us and the kids gonna live?

85
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,244
California.
Right by the water.

86
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,553
Don't leave me.

87
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,327
I ain't never gonna
leave you, beautiful.

88
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,703
I'll give you everything
you want, baby.

89
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,537
Starting with this.

90
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,440
This is what
you're gonna tell him...

91
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,107
you're going to walk
right up to Eric,

92
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,378
and you're gonna tell him
that you're going to Mexico

93
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,749
and you're not gonna join
him in this stupid war,

94
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,220
no matter what some
draft card says.

95
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,018
Okay?

96
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,987
Get your bony ass ready, soldier!
Moving out at 1700 hours.

97
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,555
What's 1700 hours?

98
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,227
You better be
getting some, Dean.

99
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,213
What the hell are you
still doing here?

100
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,120
Go home.
We're out of business.

101
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,057
You and your family are
the only ones stupid enough

102
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,423
to still be living
in this town.

103
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,587
Your kind belong
in this shithole.

104
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,510
Operator.

105
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,916
May I help you?

106
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,955
You're gonna have to speak
more clearly, ma'am.

107
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,460
I don't understand. You're gonna have
to speak more clearly.

108
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,124
I'm your friend, Hewitt.

109
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,033
Come on, y'all. Look alive now.

110
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,766
Take one last look
at that motel over there

111
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,637
'cause this here's your
lodging for the next two days.

112
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,768
What, are you gonna put
mints on our pillows too?

113
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,710
I'll tuck you in
special every night.

114
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,214
We're going
on a road trip!

115
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,715
# Hey well, I'm the friendly
stranger in the black sedan #

116
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,092
# Won't you hop inside
my car? #

117
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,893
# Got peaches, got candy,
I'm a loveable man #

118
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,422
# Take you
to the nearest star #

119
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,230
- # And I'll love you #
- # Love you #

120
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,827
- # I'll need you #
- # Need you #

121
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,862
# I want you,
got to have you, child #

122
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:38,741
# Great God in heaven
you know I love you... #

123
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,444
So what are you
gonna miss the most?

124
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,879
- Hmm?
- When you're gone,

125
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,576
what are you
gonna miss the most?

126
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,209
Fishing for
compliments here?

127
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,742
No, never.

128
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,947
- She is fishing.
- I am not.

129
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,286
Come on, tell me.

130
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,019
Besides you?

131
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,856
Nothing.

132
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,056
I mean, family
and all, sure,

133
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,759
but Dean's gonna be
right there with me.

134
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,825
- Right, Deano?
- Hoo-ha.

135
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,576
Oh, cool!

136
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,636
Don't you just love
a man on a motorcycle?

137
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,614
It's like Peter Fonda
in "Easy Rider."

138
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,139
- Hey guys, don't stare.
- Coming up fast.

139
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,775
Y'all, don't stare at them.

140
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,754
Baby, they're coming
a little too close.

141
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,221
Whoa whoa whoa.

142
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:26,886
Stop it!

143
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,224
Hey!
Fuck you!

144
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,059
Hey, we better get out of here.
Get down.

145
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,664
Hey! Get off, asshole.

146
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,370
Drive faster!

147
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,546
Man, what the hell's
your problem?

148
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,222
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah.

149
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,818
- You're all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

150
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,557
- Thomas in there?
- No, he ain't here.

151
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,333
We got a... we got a situation
on our hands here.

152
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,068
I just came back
from the slaughterhouse.

153
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,975
That 'tarded nephew
of yours killed a man.

154
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,878
Now I'm gonna have
to apprehend him.

155
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,006
I thought you might
want to accompany me,

156
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,280
help finesse the situation,
as it were.

157
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
You know what else
Jesse was saying?
Honestly, he tells me
that you can bring a horse

158
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,862
to "organism"
using your finger.

159
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,764
You believe that shit?
No, it's what he said.

160
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,462
Who's the fool that tested
that theory out, I'd like to know?

161
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,368
God damn, I wouldn't
mind doing it.

162
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,032
But I'm just saying,
a bunch of sore horses

163
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,734
running around
out in some farm...

164
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,742
Anyway, staying
around this town,

165
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,644
there's no more jobs,
no more money,

166
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,308
no more food.
It's downright suicidal.

167
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,444
And I'm the last bit
of law enforcement that's left.

168
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,216
Hell, I'm moving
to Michigan next week.

169
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:41,818
I often ask myself,
"What makes a man a killer?"

170
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,193
I don't mind saying:
You raised that retard right,

171
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,460
me and you, we ain't
taking this drive right now.

172
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,491
You can't have a creature
like that around normal folk,

173
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:54,199
- that's what I'm saying.
- He ain't retarded. He's misunderstood.

174
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,474
Oh, shit, there he is!
Jesus Christ.

175
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,610
You stay put.

176
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,206
I'll let you know
when I need you.

177
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,649
Put down the weapon, boy!

178
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,046
I seen what you did
back there, Hewitt.

179
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,924
This doesn't have to be difficult
unless'n you make it so.

180
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,689
Just put the weapon down.

181
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:20,255
Don't be stupid.

182
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,567
I think we've got
a problem, Sheriff.

183
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:40,082
Shit, I just killed the whole
fucking sheriff's department.

184
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,280
Damn, I wondered
what that felt like.

185
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:36,737
You really think you're something
in that outfit, don't you?

186
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,802
Here's your pants.
Supper's on the table.

187
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,346
Ladies love
a man in uniform.

188
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:57,619
That slaughterhouse meant more to this
town than them fools will ever know.

189
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,893
Just a matter of time now

190
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:03,561
before this town's overrun
by bikers and hippies.

191
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,264
Most families
have already fled.

192
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,933
Well, I say
let 'em go.

193
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:12,842
Let them flee to the hills
and the cities

194
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:17,281
that pollute our air,
and our water and our minds.

195
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,752
Us, we're staying
right here.

196
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:25,382
The ashes
of six generations of Hewitts

197
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,416
have been tilled
into the soil of this farm.

198
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,658
We will never abandon
the place of our birth.

199
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:37,066
We're on our own
now, people.

200
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,297
And alone

201
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,466
we will
rise above it all.

202
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:46,944
People may not remember
what we say here tonight,

203
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:51,382
but they sure as shit
gonna remember what we do.

204
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,384
Thanks to
the good sheriff here,

205
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,114
we ain't gonna
go hungry tonight.

206
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,122
Matter of fact,

207
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,522
we ain't never
gonna starve again.

208
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,220
Mm-mm-mm.

209
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:12,261
Charlie, say grace.

210
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,829
Mama, I told you
Charlie's dead.

211
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:18,400
It's Hoyt now,
Sheriff Hoyt.

212
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,111
Lord, thank You for all
this bounty that You've

213
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:26,015
provided for us here
this evening. Amen.

214
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,387
Tommy, you come on in here
and join us for supper.

215
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,655
Come on now, son.

216
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,266
Oh baby, look! Come on,
can we stop at that store?

217
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,204
It's just like the one
in California. Please?

218
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,264
Yeah yeah.

219
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

220
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,313
Come on, Bail,
you'll love this.

221
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,842
These places have tons of character.

222
00:22:56,408 --> 00:23:00,208
Y'all have some beautiful
things in here, ma'am.

223
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,179
Okay...

224
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:12,252
It'll take you a little while
to get used to things in 'Nam.

225
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,691
The people,

226
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,185
the smells, but...

227
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,428
But what?

228
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,129
You'd be amazed at the things
you can get used to.

229
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,806
Um, is everything okay
with you and Dean?

230
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,037
Uh, what do you mean?

231
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:37,208
Bailey, come on. You guys have been
exchanging odd glances this whole trip.

232
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,375
Oh...

233
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,485
Excuse me, ma'am, can you tell me where
the bathroom is, please?

234
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,719
Through the back.

235
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,731
Pretty.

236
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:58,668
But pretty only goes skin-deep.
Ugly is to the bone.

237
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,001
Leave them be.

238
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,749
Come on, Bailey.

239
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,809
Look, we've been through
a lot together.

240
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,184
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

241
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,555
Me and Dean are
going to Mexico.

242
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,857
He's not gonna
go with Eric.

243
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,386
And uh, he's not
going to Vietnam.

244
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,366
Chrissie...

245
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:33,098
- what do you have to say?
- I say, go.

246
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,130
Get the hell away from this war, okay?
Just cling to what you got.

247
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:39,268
Then why are you
letting Eric go back?

248
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,041
- It's just in him.
- What's in him?

249
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,344
- The war.
- What do you mean?

250
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,715
Look, you do something long enough,
eventually you start to like it.

251
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,185
Hah!

252
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,755
- Bitch.
- Scared the titties right off her.

253
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,362
God damn it.

254
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,694
Broke my mirror.

255
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,758
You think the girls
are gonna be all right

256
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,963
driving back alone
after they drop us off?

257
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,462
Oh, I'm not worried
about them, Dean.

258
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,746
Are you sure you got
nothing to tell me?

259
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,216
Can we go?

260
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,882
You all right?

261
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,983
Yeah... let's just go.

262
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,565
You didn't even buy anything, baby.

263
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:43,700
Yeah, it was... it was nothing like
the one in California.

264
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,711
I guess we'll just have to go back
to that one then.

265
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:56,044
What are you
doing, man?

266
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,385
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not going, Eric.

267
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,015
What do you mean,
you're not going?

268
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,457
I'm not going, Eric!

269
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,930
You think I don't
hear you at night, man,

270
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,866
in your sleep, wailing from
what you've done over there?

271
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,892
Now, how could you
want that for me?

272
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,235
I'm glad Dad's
not here to see this.

273
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,638
What, his son
the coward?

274
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,138
Well, guess what, Eric,
I am not like you!

275
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
All right?
I am not ready for this shit!
I have no problem
with the Vietcong over in
Vietnam or whatever...
What the hell do you think
I'm going back for, huh?

276
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,580
- I'm going back for you!
- Stop it!

277
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,725
You think you're the only one who's
ever been scared?

278
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,750
You think I wasn't scared?
You think I'm still not scared?

279
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:37,819
Shut up!

280
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,098
What does she want?

281
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,629
Pull over!
Pull over!

282
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,638
Oh God. Jesus Christ,
don't pull over!

283
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,139
Shit, she's got a gun, Eric.

284
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,971
Eric!

285
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,103
Shut up!
Stay calm.

286
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,670
- What are we gonna do?
- Eric, she's pulling...

287
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,651
Oh my God!

288
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,183
Look out!

289
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,304
God...

290
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,970
Chrissie.

291
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,488
Buddy, Dean, Deano...

292
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:45,428
I'm gonna get you help.
I'm gonna find Chrissie.

293
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:48,591
Chrissie!

294
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,569
Wow, man, I am impressed.

295
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,006
- Y'all are tougher than I thought.
- What do you want from us?

296
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,669
Oh... everything.

297
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,204
How about we get this robbery thing
out of the way, huh?

298
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,392
Fuck.

299
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:24,095
You play along, and I won't have to kill
this fucking cop or you. Get up!

300
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,009
I'm glad you're
here, officer.

301
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,452
Oh, I just bet you are.

302
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,321
Whoa!

303
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:53,890
Sir.

304
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,059
You sit down and
you stay right there.

305
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:04,207
You kids okay?

306
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,268
Why don't you step out
of the car, if you don't mind?

307
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,076
- He shot her! He shot her!
- She can't move, sir. She needs help.

308
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,276
Sir, I can't find
my girlfriend.

309
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,979
Get a grip
on yourself, son.

310
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,647
Sir, I can't find...

311
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,852
Now, that was
for your own good.

312
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,857
Okay, come on kids.
Let's get out of the car now.

313
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,957
Sir, she's... she's really badly hurt.

314
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,798
Right, well okay, kids.

315
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,805
I'm gonna ask you nicely
one more time.

316
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:39,640
Get out of the fuckin' car
or I'm gonna blow your fuckin' head off.

317
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:45,313
Come on, you can make it.
Ooh-ee!

318
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,046
You kids must have
been hauling ass.

319
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,111
Look at the fucking
mess you made.

320
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:53,613
Hey hey hey.
Come on now.

321
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,353
I'm just here
to help you.

322
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,623
Come on now.

323
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:01,325
- Go on. I ain't gonna hurt you.
- Sir, sir, please.

324
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,061
I'm not gonna
hurt you.

325
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,904
You fucking motherfucker!

326
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,971
See there? That didn't
even hurt, did it?

327
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,882
There ain't no fire
in this accident.

328
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:28,984
Which one of you assholes
burned his draft card?

329
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,858
Get on over here, boys.

330
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,191
- Come on, get over here.
- No.

331
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,530
God damn it,
get over here!

332
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:46,600
Which one of you boys'
name is Dean Hill?

333
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:53,345
Honey, you're name
ain't Dean, is it?

334
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,588
I am, sir...

335
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,563
I'm Dean.

336
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:15,602
Well, hey, dean.
Good to meet you.

337
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,040
You kids took one

338
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,273
big, nasty, giant shit

339
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:24,145
right in my backyard.

340
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:28,949
Now we do know that you're
a coward, right, Dean?

341
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:32,115
I'm gonna to give you
a chance to die a hero.

342
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,221
All right, get her in there,
God damn it.

343
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:42,529
I'm starting to think you
like wasting my time, blondie.

344
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,159
Hurry up!

345
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,940
- I saw Chrissie.
- You did?

346
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,604
She's okay.
Just don't say anything.

347
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
- Where is she?
- Shut up.

348
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,368
Hey, Monty, come pick up
this damn wreck.

349
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,777
It's about a quarter mile
south of Hodd's place.

350
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,509
There's a motorcycle too.

351
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,815
Is having a dead biker chick ride
shotgun proper police procedure, sir?

352
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,947
Honey, if that
was your mama,

353
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:43,950
would you want me to stick her
in the trunk like a dead animal?

354
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,826
I just think
this is bullshit.

355
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:49,355
You got something to say
about this bullshit, do you, Dean?

356
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,924
No, sir.

357
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,464
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you, Dean?

358
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,150
Where is the gun?

359
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,796
You look through all this
shit on the road?

360
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Is that how we agreed you'd
address me over official FCC airwaves?
No, "Sheriff."

361
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,277
Oh...

362
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,349
pretty little rascal,
ain't you?

363
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,213
Don't you have to read us our rights
or something, Sheriff?

364
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,815
Who in the hell put you assholes
in charge anyway?

365
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:03,088
You see, that badge is
the authority around here.

366
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:04,560
And I ask the questions.

367
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,731
And what brings
you kids here?

368
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,762
Sir, we were just
passing through,

369
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,862
on my way
to reenlist, sir.

370
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:18,000
A doughboy.
Hot damn.

371
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,942
I was in the army myself
almost a year.

372
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,638
Marines, sir.

373
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,704
Six of one,
half dozen of the other.

374
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,875
Heh, don't make
no damn difference.

375
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,283
You look kind
of young to me.

376
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:31,186
Where was you stationed?

377
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,349
Vietnam, sir.

378
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:37,418
Vietnam. Really?

379
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,660
You kill any commies?

380
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,929
Uh, a handful of gooks, sir.

381
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,232
Where are you taking us?

382
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,740
Where are you
taking us, sir?

383
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,768
How was it over there?

384
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,278
Well, it's a...
it's a different culture.

385
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:03,913
But you'd be amazed at the things you
get used to over there, sir.

386
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,150
You don't say.

387
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
This the sheriff station?

388
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,260
No, it's Mama's house.

389
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,738
Oh! Don't even think
about it here.

390
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,743
What are we
gonna do?

391
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,722
I'm gonna kill
this motherfucker.

392
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,095
Hey!

393
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,639
You kids best not be making a mess
in my car or you'll clean it up.

394
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:00,269
- He knows, Eric.
- What?

395
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,835
He knows you're not me.

396
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,676
- No, he doesn't, Dean.
- Hey, Tommy!

397
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,409
- Stay the course.
- We're out here!

398
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,077
Come on, boy,
get over here!

399
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,610
- What is that?
- Get the lead out of your ass!

400
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,522
Come on, big guy!

401
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,218
What is that?

402
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,154
Go ahead, get her
on out of there.

403
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:42,647
Come on, private!

404
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,700
Oh my God.

405
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,329
I'm gonna get
us out of here, okay?

406
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,505
Dean! Stay with me!

407
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,603
I need you
to be a soldier.

408
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:12,639
People are gonna come
looking for 'em, I know it.

409
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,810
You have made
a big mistake!

410
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,150
Boy, are you dumb.

411
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,520
Nobody's gonna miss those
creatures, not one person.

412
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,124
Not now,
not when they gone.

413
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

414
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:57,283
Let's see.
Anything in here?

415
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,297
A bunch of shit.

416
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,486
Oh...

417
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:31,359
You little bastard,
I know you've got more in there.

418
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:56,016
Come on, Tommy, ain't no different
than the slaughterhouse.

419
00:40:56,053 --> 00:41:00,183
Meat's meat, bones bones.

420
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,021
Get it done.

421
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:10,257
My daddy always told me

422
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:14,260
that if you want to be a good farmer
you gotta keep your livestock clean.

423
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,702
Clean goat
is a happy goat.

424
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:23,178
What the hell do you
want from us, man?

425
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,205
Are you happy yet?

426
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,642
Hey!

427
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,208
H... hey, help us.
Help us down, please.

428
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,948
I don't get involved
in his affairs. No.

429
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,842
Please, help me.

430
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:41,083
Please, please.

431
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,644
No! No!

432
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,151
Help me! No!

433
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,710
No!

434
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,682
- No!
- Bailey.

435
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,426
- I didn't know.
- Didn't know what?

436
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,159
I didn't know you were
going back there for me.

437
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,296
Let's figure out how
to get out of here, Dean.

438
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,602
By God, I'm gonna make
a soldier out of you yet!

439
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,372
No! Please, please!

440
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,977
Are you ashamed
of your country, Dean?

441
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,716
No, please! No!

442
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,591
What do you think,
soldier?

443
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:54,792
What would be the proper
punishment for treason?

444
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,426
Just please
let him go, sir. No!

445
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:03,037
I can't make out a word you're saying,
you know it, asshole?

446
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,200
You're killing him, sir!
Please!

447
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:08,541
No no no!
Please, sir!

448
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:13,977
Ain't nothing I hate worse
than a draft-dodging hippie protester.

449
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,451
I'm Dean!

450
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,215
It was my draft card!

451
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,279
It was my draft card!
It was my draft card!

452
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,383
And you'd just stand
here and let him die.

453
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:25,418
Sir, could you let
him breathe, please?

454
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,953
Please, can you
let him breathe?

455
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,193
- My apologies.
- Eric!

456
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,430
Oh shit!

457
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:40,500
Well, so now you want to play
soldier. Is that it?

458
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,621
Your brother
saved your life.

459
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:55,591
I'm gonna fucking
cut your head off.

460
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:59,221
Yeah, you just keep
sweet-talking me, dumpling.

461
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:19,412
Help me!

462
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:31,355
Back in 1952, Korean War,

463
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,955
yours truly was a P.O.W.

464
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,124
That's "prisoner of war"
for you,

465
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,929
and I know what in the hell
I'm talking about.

466
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,459
Used to be
Sergeant Major Hoyt.

467
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,735
Back in those days
there wasn't no rules.

468
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:46,675
No regulations like
there are today.

469
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:50,612
You got captured,
you had two choices:

470
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:54,208
You starve to death
or survive.

471
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:01,991
Now, you had to eat.
Rations were scarce.

472
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:06,052
So, well,
about once a week

473
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,725
some poor soul was chosen.

474
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:13,292
Chosen?

475
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:17,637
You fucking idiot!
I just told you we had to eat!

476
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:21,041
Ain't you listening
to me? Huh?

477
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:24,980
I'd say that's the ultimate sacrifice
for your country, wouldn't you?

478
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:31,145
Why are you doing this?

479
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:34,089
Got to get
you cleaned up.

480
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,123
We're gonna have company.

481
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:40,562
You don't want to look
dirty for company, do you?

482
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,189
Huh?

483
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:47,135
This is your lucky day!

484
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:51,232
Now what happens if you kids
drive all the way up to Austin

485
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:55,712
just to find out that you don't even
qualify to be in the army?

486
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:59,944
I'm concerned about
your physical fitness here!

487
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:04,920
Now, doesn't that
make you feel special?

488
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:07,082
Huh? Don't it?

489
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,921
Please.

490
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:12,486
That would be,
"Please, Sheriff."

491
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:15,555
- You got it?
- Please, Sheriff.

492
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,329
Hey, boy, there you go.
I knew you could do that.

493
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,393
That wasn't so hard,
was it?

494
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:24,271
How would you like to just
stand right up here today

495
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,072
and just walk
right on out of here, huh?

496
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,738
I'd like that, Sheriff.

497
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:34,274
Yeah, well, freedom ain't free.
You know that, right?

498
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,947
What you gonna
do is 20 push-ups.

499
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:41,185
20 push-ups stand
between you and freedom.

500
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:45,423
This shit is what heroes
are made of, you know?

501
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:48,295
Well, come on,
I'm waiting!

502
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,357
Let's get with
the program, sunshine!

503
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,800
Come on, you can do it!
Get those push-ups now!

504
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:54,428
No!

505
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:57,599
Shh, now don't cry.

506
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,835
Don't cry.

507
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:04,978
No.

508
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,243
No!

509
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:09,684
You shut your cocksucker,
you son of a bitch!

510
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,482
One!

511
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:17,050
Whoa, that was a really
fine push-up there. One...

512
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:21,294
Two...

513
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
We've got ourselves a regular
American hero here, ain't we?
Three.
Come on, sweetheart.
# Hush, little baby #

514
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,609
# Don't say a word... #

515
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,080
Ow!

516
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:42,677
# Mama's gonna buy
you a mockingbird... #

517
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:45,244
Eight.

518
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:49,950
What's it gonna be?

519
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,757
You're gonna be
the motherfucker who eats?

520
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:56,323
Or are you gonna be
the poor sorry motherfucker

521
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,594
who gets ate?

522
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:02,003
# If that mockingbird
don't sing... #

523
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:08,871
# Mama's gonna buy you
a golden ring... #

524
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:11,710
Don't give up, Dean!
Show this motherfucker!

525
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,773
Show me that you
ain't as fucked up

526
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:16,342
as the rest of your
useless goddamn generation.

527
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:17,785
Eighteen!

528
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:20,119
# If that golden... #

529
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,887
- Come on!
- Nine...

530
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:26,362
# ... Is gonna buy you
a looking glass... #

531
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:27,488
Go!

532
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:34,003
That's only half of one.
That don't count, boy!

533
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,400
Don't give up, Dean!

534
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,244
- 20.
- Yeah!

535
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:46,708
Don't cry.

536
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:48,912
No!

537
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:53,252
- No.
- I never had me a little girl.

538
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,322
Got more guts than
I thought you had, boy.

539
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:00,728
I'm a man of my word.
You're free to go.

540
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:05,162
I'm gonna
fucking kill you!

541
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:08,535
My money says
he ain't going nowhere.

542
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

543
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,924
Stop!

544
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:32,190
Please, stop!

545
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,789
Stop!

546
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,195
Please stop!

547
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,472
Look... my friends, they...

548
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:46,476
they have my friends, okay? They're in a
house over there through the woods. I...

549
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:52,281
Look, they have your friend.
They took your friend.

550
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,577
I saw you both
at the store.

551
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:58,281
He shot her.
The sheriff shot her.

552
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,458
Show me where.

553
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,069
Weather has been
so hot lately.

554
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,511
It's important to drink
your liquids, you know?

555
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:27,176
The body needs
to hydrate.

556
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:33,682
I got me some of that breakfast tea...
that's what they call it...

557
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,385
and I fixed me up
a batch of that

558
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:40,829
and I had it over a big fruit jar of ice
with plenty of sugar.

559
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:45,358
And I had that
breakfast tea for dinner.

560
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:48,428
Tastes like paradise.

561
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:50,269
Not a bit
of difference.

562
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:53,242
Iced tea.

563
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,211
Yeah, iced tea.

564
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,407
You know
what else is good?

565
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:01,474
- Iced coffee.
- Oh.

566
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:05,955
Delicious.
With them little cinnamon sprinkles.

567
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,824
Dean. Dean!

568
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:49,595
Dean, you did good.
But we gotta hide, okay?

569
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,463
Come on!
Come on!

570
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,977
Do you have any idea where
the hell we're going?

571
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,140
Yes, it's...

572
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,514
it's here somewhere.

573
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,751
Sometimes...

574
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:15,019
I just can't stop eating
them little chocolates.

575
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:18,118
They're so good.

576
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,685
I put coconut in them.

577
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:22,129
Oh, sweet Jesus.

578
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,794
Hoyt! Hoyt!

579
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:30,897
Come here! Hoyt!

580
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,738
Hoyt! Hoyt!

581
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:36,674
Eric!

582
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:40,205
- He's in here!
- Eric! Get me out of here!

583
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,980
- Shut your mouth!
- Oh, my!

584
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,388
He's here! He's here!
He's here!

585
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,325
Help! Help!

586
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,158
There's keys over
there on the counter.

587
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,398
Damn you!
A man's home is his fucking castle!

588
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:02,735
- What the fuck are you doing in here?
- Oh no!

589
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,608
Hey!

590
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,548
Find the truck. Go!
I'll get Dean! I'll get Dean!

591
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,880
Unlock the door!

592
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:22,784
Thomas, Thomas, get up here!
I need you!

593
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,809
Come on, Dean, come on.

594
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:54,721
Hey! Get back here,
you skinny bitch!

595
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,279
No!

596
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:23,013
Come on, we're gonna
get out of here.

597
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:27,584
Dean, go! Go!
Come on!

598
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:29,683
Shoot me, you asshole!

599
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:33,924
You're not a soldier!
You hold that gun like a fucking girl!

600
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:35,225
Get out of my way.

601
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:37,233
You're not a candy-ass,
are you, Sheriff?

602
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:40,168
Pull the fucking trigger!

603
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,532
I ain't finished
with you yet.

604
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:52,040
Well... let's just go see
if we caught anything.

605
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,687
Well well well...

606
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:11,599
it's a good thing
you didn't go to Vietnam.

607
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:16,435
Something like
this might've happened.

608
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,382
You don't like playing with me
anymore because I'm a pussy.

609
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:34,890
That's what you said.

610
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:37,358
Well, my nephew Tommy
ain't no pussy.

611
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,726
Maybe you want to play
with him for a little while.

612
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

613
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:08,754
That's it.

614
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:13,759
Okay, so what
are we gonna do?

615
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,890
We? I'm gonna get
my girlfriend.

616
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,526
No no, look.
What about my friends?

617
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:21,332
- What?
- My friends.

618
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,236
Fuck your friends.

619
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,571
You're on your own.

620
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,667
You asshole!

621
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,318
Shit.

622
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:32,137
Dean, Dean. Oh fuck. Thank God.

623
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,608
What happened?

624
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:37,112
- Chrissie. Oh, thank God.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

625
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:39,671
- No no no. Don't!
- I'm sorry.

626
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:42,378
Just stay still.
Okay, are you okay? You're okay.

627
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,352
They're psycho.

628
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:46,787
Come on, where's Eric
and Bailey? Come on.

629
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:50,224
In the house.

630
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,490
You need to go
get help, Chrissie.

631
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,518
Okay?

632
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:56,157
There's no help to go for.

633
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:02,732
I have to go in there. You're gonna stay
here. I'm gonna come get you, okay?

634
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:04,637
Okay.

635
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:09,203
Don't you think you're
gonna go anyplace, huh?

636
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,547
I love you.

637
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:59,985
No! Come on! You don't... you don't
have to do this, man, please.

638
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:03,055
No! No. No!

639
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,196
No!

640
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,197
You don't have
to do this.

641
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,602
You son of a bitch!

642
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,808
Fuck you!

643
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,881
Fucker.

644
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:43,089
Huh?

645
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,427
What the fuck...

646
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,403
Oh shit!

647
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:03,378
- Uh, he shot me! Uh!
- Shut up! Shut up!

648
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:05,471
Where's the girl?

649
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:07,483
I'm gonna blow your head off.
Tell me where the girl is.

650
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:12,451
I'm shot! Shit!

651
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:16,015
How many times I gotta tell you
not to play with guns?

652
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:18,925
Oh, Jesus, oh...

653
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,553
Now look what you've
done to yourself.

654
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:24,123
- I didn't do it.
- Stop your damn whining, Uncle Monty.

655
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:26,260
Mama, get some
towels in here.

656
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,293
Uncle Monty made a mess.

657
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:29,861
Sheriff.

658
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,703
Who in the hell are you?

659
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:34,175
- What do you want, boy?
- I want my girl.

660
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:38,211
Take me to her
or I'm gonna blow your head off.

661
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:39,839
Okay, all right.

662
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:43,616
- Where is she?
- Thomas!

663
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,986
Hey! Do not fuck around.
Where is the girl?

664
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,548
Come on.

665
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,839
Help me!

666
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:10,279
Thomas!

667
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:17,212
Thomas!

668
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:19,050
Thomas, where're you at?

669
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,471
Eric, are you okay?

670
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,974
What are you doing here?
You gotta get out of here.

671
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:16,274
- You're... you're gonna be okay.
- How bad is it? Tell me.

672
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,913
- No! No!
- It's all right. I can't feel it.

673
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:24,579
- I'm gonna get you... it's okay.
- Did he cut it off?

674
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,247
- It's okay.
- I can't feel it.

675
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,654
No! No!

676
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:35,629
I'm cold.

677
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:39,829
How... how many?

678
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:43,669
- Three.
- Boys or girls?

679
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:46,800
All boys.

680
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:47,934
What are their names?

681
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:52,971
Paul and Christopher...

682
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:54,277
and Eric.

683
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:56,478
Okay. Okay.
It's gonna be okay.

684
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,147
I promise.
I promise, okay?

685
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:03,190
Take it easy.
There she is.

686
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:06,291
Help me.

687
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,695
That's not her.

688
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:11,165
Shit, that ain't her.

689
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,135
You don't want
to see the other girl.

690
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,569
Just shoot him!

691
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:18,471
You dumb son of a bitch.

692
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:25,707
Get him, Tommy, come on!

693
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,953
Damn it! Come on, Tommy.

694
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,289
This is one
of those assholes

695
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,658
who used to fuck with you
in the schoolyard, Tommy.

696
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:43,859
Come on, Tommy, get over here!
Get that thing going!

697
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:45,867
Let's go, Tommy!
Come on!

698
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:53,406
Crank it up!
Let's go!

699
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,307
What it is, asshole!

700
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:56,902
Yeah!

701
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:23,769
You beautiful bastard, you!

702
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,936
You fucking asshole!

703
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:33,915
You son of a bitch!
Comin' in my fucking house...

704
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,285
Oh, God.

705
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:47,852
You have to
get out of here.

706
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,593
- No no no!
- Get out of here.

707
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:53,295
- No!
- Yes, Chrissie, please.

708
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,729
Hide!

709
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:45,119
What are you doing?

710
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:48,089
Don't. No.
What are you...

711
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,293
No!

712
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

713
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:22,810
Thomas! Tommy.

714
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:26,337
Thomas, quit playing with your
fucking dolls and get up here!

715
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:35,787
I'm glad you brought
your little buddy.

716
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:38,987
Hmm, I like
your new face.

717
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,422
Come on, Tommy,
get up here.

718
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

719
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:59,967
Please! Please!

720
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:05,407
Help!

721
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:36,769
Please, please, somebody help!

722
01:13:36,812 --> 01:13:40,304
Now this will take your
fever down, all right?

723
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,147
See what you've done?

724
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:48,987
You killed that sheriff
and you started up a whole whirlwind.

725
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:51,959
Mama, please stop
your damn bellyaching.

726
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:57,159
Uncle Monty,
I love you.

727
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:00,396
You know that, and I always do
what's right by you, don't I?

728
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:01,926
And you trust me,
don't you?

729
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,336
Yeah, I trust you.
Just do something.

730
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:06,307
Take care of you.

731
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:08,172
Get in here, boy!

732
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,303
- Uh! Ow!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

733
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:12,313
Tommy!

734
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:17,980
- Now, this ain't gonna hurt...
- Huh?

735
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,783
...much.

736
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:23,347
What's that on your face?

737
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:25,485
Mama, you get over there
and hold Uncle Monty.

738
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:28,553
- Why?
- 'Cause he ain't gonna like this much,

739
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,258
that's why.

740
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,494
- No!
- What the fuck is this?

741
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:34,161
Surgery.
Come on, Tommy.

742
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:37,195
- No!
- Oh my God!

743
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,945
Oh, bullshit.
Look at that!

744
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,107
Now, Tommy,
that's goddamn sloppy.

745
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,379
That'll get infected.
Even him up. Come on.

746
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:52,182
- Huh?
- What?

747
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:55,418
- Sheriff, no, stop!
- No!

748
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:08,335
There you go.
Nice work, Tommy.

749
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:10,463
What did
you do that for?

750
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:13,473
Balance.

751
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:19,613
I'll get Tommy
to wrap this up.

752
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,349
Please, somebody help.

753
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,833
Okay. Shh.

754
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,666
You're gonna
be okay, okay?

755
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:51,570
Shh shh, I'm sorry.

756
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:57,706
It's okay. You're safe.

757
01:16:57,746 --> 01:17:00,647
They know you're here.

758
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:07,687
I'll have Mama throw on
another plate for supper.

759
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:10,783
You... you can stay?

760
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
I think we need a little more
garlic in this one.

761
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:27,933
Mama, a little more
garlic in this one.

762
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:35,009
I'll go set the table.

763
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:38,886
Oh, shit!

764
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:42,151
It's okay, Mama.
Just wash it off. It'll be fine.

765
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,090
Don't step on the fingers.

766
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:48,119
What the hell are they
doing on the floor, anyway?

767
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:51,929
Good thing you keep
a clean house.

768
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:53,935
I wonder whose tongue this is.

769
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:57,200
That's that fuckin' biker.

770
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:09,876
# Hush little baby, don't say a word #

771
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:13,376
# Mama's gonna buy you #

772
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:16,914
# A mockingbird #

773
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
# If that mockingbird
don't sing #
# Mama's gonna buy you #

774
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,230
# A golden ring... #

775
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:33,968
# If that golden
ring turns brass #

776
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:44,808
# Mama's gonna buy
you a looking glass... #

777
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:53,188
Why are you doing this?

778
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:57,756
No talking until after
I've said grace, asshole.

779
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:12,179
Now...

780
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:16,548
let's give thanks
for the bounty that's been given us.

781
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:19,486
Bow your heads.

782
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:23,423
I was hungry
and He gave me meat.

783
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:25,926
I was thirsty
and He gave me drink.

784
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:29,328
I was a stranger
and He took me in.

785
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:35,162
This family has endured
through adversity and pain.

786
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:39,105
- We have endured.
- Dean.

787
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:41,507
We have prevailed.

788
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:44,273
We will never ever
go hungry again.

789
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:48,115
Amen.

790
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:52,486
I have
a question for you.

791
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:57,958
One that involves
the family tree, the...

792
01:19:57,993 --> 01:20:01,190
lineage, if you will,

793
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:03,493
So I guess this
one's for the table.

794
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:07,000
You guys fuck
all your cousins

795
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:08,525
or just the ones
you find attractive?

796
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:13,563
You blasphemous bitch!

797
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:18,045
This is redemption, lady!
That's what this is!

798
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Oh, you're all gonna pay
for your sins. That's right!
And especially you!
Mama... go take care
of Uncle Monty.

799
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,550
You know what, Mama?

800
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:35,893
I don't think this
one likes your cooking.

801
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:38,525
But who gives a shit?

802
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:41,502
She's gonna be sucking
her soup through a straw

803
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:43,936
for some time
to come now, ain't she?

804
01:20:43,972 --> 01:20:47,169
Come on, Monty,
take a sip.

805
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:51,145
You gotta have something
to build up your strength.

806
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,073
Please do it.

807
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:58,711
Just do whatever you're gonna do,
you bunch of degenerates!

808
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:02,314
I will not have you
speak ill of this family.

809
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,793
Come on, now,
open your mouth.

810
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:17,627
No. No. No.

811
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:34,779
Set her free, child.

812
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:40,954
No! No!

813
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:45,629
No! No! No! No!

814
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:47,931
No! No!

815
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:52,770
Take that one downstairs!

816
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:55,332
No, you stay away from me,
you fucking animal!

817
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:57,902
You get the fuck
away from me! No!

818
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:59,811
Get your hands off me!

819
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:01,816
You dirty animal!

820
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:04,250
No! Dean! Dean!

821
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:07,346
Can't you see?
Your friend ain't with us no more.

822
01:22:07,389 --> 01:22:11,223
No! No! No!

823
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:19,499
Here we go.

824
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:23,026
Dean! Help! No!

825
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,369
No!

826
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,214
Hey!

827
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:41,221
Where in the hell
you going, bitch?

828
01:22:49,597 --> 01:22:51,827
She's gonna tell them all
what we done.

829
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:10,078
There comes a time when
every boy becomes a man.

830
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:41,071
You motherfucker!

831
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:44,313
Now we'll see what kind of soldier
you are, Sheriff.

832
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:48,849
One!

833
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:52,223
That was beautiful
form, Sheriff!

834
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Two! Halfway doesn't
count, dickhead!
Three! Is that all you got?
Is that all you fucking got?

835
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:01,899
Fucker! You killed
my girlfriend!

836
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:03,767
You fucking asshole!

837
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:05,636
Fuck you!

838
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:11,538
My money says
you're not going anywhere.

839
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:15,540
Fuck.

840
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,156
Fuck.

841
01:27:09,123 --> 01:27:11,114
Chrissie!

842
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:32,787
From 1969 to 1973

843
01:30:32,827 --> 01:30:36,888
the Hewitt family murdered
33 people across the state of Texas.

844
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:41,027
To this day their killing spree
is universally considered

845
01:30:41,068 --> 01:30:44,697
one of the most notorious
and perversely sadistic crimes

846
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:47,367
in the annals
of American history:

847
01:30:47,408 --> 01:30:49,774
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
