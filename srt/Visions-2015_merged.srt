3
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:21,105
- David?
- Hey...hey...

4
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:25,943
- David?

5
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:28,012
Ohh...

6
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,246
Yeah, I know. Shh! Lie still.

7
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,815
We need a doctor!
-David, what happened?

8
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:37,288
No, no, it's alright.
You were in a car accident.

9
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:53,737
There was another car.
What happened to the other car?

10
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,974
Oh, David... Oh, David!

11
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:14,024
Eveleigh? Eveleigh?
Sweetie, you're OK. I'm here.

12
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:16,360
No, David, it's not OK.

13
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,796
There was a baby
in the other car.

14
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,198
-What happened to it?
-No, no, no...

15
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,033
Yeah, something
really bad happened!

16
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:26,203
Eveleigh, it wasn't your fault.
Try and go to sleep.

17
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,839
Try and go to sleep.

18
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,420
Oh...

19
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:03,267
Aww.

20
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:56,854
But you gotta be careful
with the potassium...

21
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,522
Uh-oh. Here she is.

22
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:13,137
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Hello.

23
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,772
-I'm Emilio.
-Evey.

24
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,039
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

25
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,209
-You showing David the ropes?
-Yes, he's a fast learner.

26
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:22,079
This is like getting
a master's degree in agriculture

27
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,380
in a one-month crash course.

28
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,450
Would you mind looking
over that for me? Thanks.

29
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,118
Come here.

30
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,487
You're like
a mountain man out here.

31
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:31,455
Thank you.

32
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:34,158
Eveleigh's Vineyard?
Are you really calling it that?

33
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,426
-You don't like it?
-I love it.

34
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:37,494
I love it. Thank you.

35
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:39,429
I know it doesn't
look like much right now,

36
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:43,967
but in September we'll be
seeing our first harvest.

37
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,537
And you just walked past
an acre of cabernet,

38
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,906
a hillside of pinot gris
and then over here...

39
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:53,210
Are we crazy for doing this
right now, David?

40
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,579
Come here.

41
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,484
I don't know about you,
but I'm definitely crazy.

42
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:04,221
Seriously, I think this
is gonna be good for you.

43
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:07,090
I need you to be happy, Evey.

44
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:09,226
Well, you're very needy
that way.

45
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,162
There's only one thing
I want you to be thinking about

46
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:16,233
and that's having us
a healthy baby.

47
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,225
Ahh...

48
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,533
Victor. Hors d'oeuvre?

49
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:27,037
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm going to make a toast first.

50
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,573
Here. Here.

51
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:32,009
Thank you.

52
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,443
I'd like to make a toast.

53
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:36,213
When I first heard that
there was a young couple

54
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,414
from Los Angeles, no less,

55
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,217
who were thinking about
reopening the winery,

56
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,020
I have to admit
that my first thought

57
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,389
was, "You have
got to be kidding."

58
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:50,961
But now that I've met David
and his lovely wife...

59
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,296
-Evey.
-Evey.

60
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,466
..I am struck by their passion
and their dedication

61
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:59,469
and these are good
qualities to have

62
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:00,637
because as we all know

63
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,940
this valley has
a bit of a reputation.

64
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:08,145
It's a hard place - crops that
fail and rains that never come.

65
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,048
But the vines that
do survive are stronger

66
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,250
because they seem
to thrive on this adversity.

67
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,987
It gives them character, just
like those of us who live here.

68
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:21,224
Now, the wine you're drinking
is a Folgore '89.

69
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:24,661
And I'm not talking about 1989.
That's 1889.

70
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:28,632
It's one of the first wines
that was made in this valley

71
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:29,566
and it was made right here.

72
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:34,438
I thought we'd have it tonight
in honour of this young couple

73
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,109
and to welcome them
to our very special club.

74
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,078
- Salud.
- Salud.

75
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,181
-Thank you.
-Salud.

76
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,053
Hey. Thank you for coming.

77
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:53,056
-I know it's a superlong drive.
-Long? It was an eternity!

78
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:55,192
But look at all
the eligible bachelors

79
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,360
you get to meet tonight.

80
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,462
You know how much
I love a man in overalls.

81
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:02,532
He's actually not wearing
anything underneath those.

82
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:06,036
Oh, please help me
suck up to these wine people.

83
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,571
I feel like I'm doing
a terrible job.

84
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:11,274
You mean like that old guy
who gave us the old wine?

85
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:12,342
That is Victor Napoli.

86
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:15,178
He's kind of like
the godfather of this region,

87
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,581
so we're very lucky he's here.

88
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,650
Hey, what's going on?

89
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,357
Helena Knoll!
-Hi.

90
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:31,762
No more wine
unless you're Uber'ing it.

91
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:35,599
I can't believe she came.

92
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,800
Who is it? Who is it?

93
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,403
Helena Knoll,
top distributor in the valley.

94
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:43,607
Basically, if we get our debut
wine on her list, we're in.

95
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,642
Very nice to see you. Goodnight.

96
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,811
Mmm, goodnight.

97
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:55,685
-Bacon date?
-I beg your pardon?

98
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:59,356
They're bacon dates.
They're quite delicious.

99
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,759
-I know they look weird.
-Hmph, yeah.

100
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:05,529
-You must be Eveleigh.
-Yes. Hi.

101
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,397
-Helena.
-Thank you for coming, Helena.

102
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,232
-You're welcome.
-Nice to meet you.

103
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:11,101
You know what?
Let's go sit down.

104
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,670
I want to get
a good look at you.

105
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,139
OK.

106
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:24,815
So did you know the Porters,

107
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,650
the family that
lived here before?

108
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:30,554
Oh, no. I know of them.
They left before we...

109
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,190
They were in
way over their heads.

110
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,259
Yeah, well, David's wanted
to do this his whole life,

111
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:39,729
ever since I've known him, so...

112
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:44,334
It must be a very exciting time
for you and your husband,

113
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,871
what with a baby on the way.

114
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:52,876
Where are your facilities?

115
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,644
Facilities?

116
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:56,179
Yes, the restroom, darling,

117
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,448
unless you want me
to go au naturel.

118
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,618
Just right back there.

119
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,654
Stay strong for the baby...

120
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,623
Helena, are you OK?

121
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,393
It's just
us mommies now.

122
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:46,730
It's just us mommies now.

123
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:54,204
Ohh! Don't touch me!

124
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,240
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Are you OK?

125
00:12:57,242 --> 00:12:59,576
Of...of course I am.

126
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,512
Jesus, of course I am.

127
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,725
What was that?

128
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:19,596
Honestly, it was like
she was possessed.

129
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,898
I've never seen
anything like it.

130
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,832
It was terrifying.

131
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:29,573
Well, chalk it up to another
mystery of the valley, I guess.

132
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,541
-I'm serious, honey.
-I am too.

133
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:35,512
If there was one person I wanted
to impress tonight, it was her.

134
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,615
Was she drunk or something?

135
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:40,450
No, I don't think so.

136
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,920
And she knew I was pregnant.
I mean, how does she know that?

137
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:45,922
It's not like
we're Facebook friends.

138
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:51,261
That is weird.
I didn't tell anybody.

139
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,964
I mean, am I showing?

140
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,533
You want me to take a look?

141
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,269
-Oh, you'd love that.
-What? Uhh!

142
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,503
OK, the claw will take the look.

143
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:03,807
I made the bacon dates tonight.
I've done my fair share.

144
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,811
- I'll show you bacon dates.

145
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Oh...

146
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:53,923
Arggh! Oh!

147
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,932
--What is it?

148
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:38,868
Oh, it's nothing.

149
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,071
Ohh...

150
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:44,874
Mmm...

151
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:15,972
- Shit!

152
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,469
Looks like everything
in here is going fine.

153
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,672
So exciting.

154
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:28,044
How are you feeling otherwise?

155
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:31,614
You have any pain
around your temples?

156
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:33,550
Oh, I'm good.

157
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,652
I mean, I'm still
having nightmares

158
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:39,756
and I'm still afraid to drive,
but other than that I'm fine.

159
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,891
That doesn't sound fine
to me, Evey.

160
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:44,160
Have you been in contact
with your psychiatrist

161
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:46,029
since you got off the meds?

162
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,464
You may be still be suffering

163
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,232
from lingering PTSD symptoms
from the accident.

164
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,101
I know where this is headed.
I'm not gonna take any meds.

165
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:55,071
Sorry, but I'm not gonna
do anything to hurt the baby.

166
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:57,841
I understand.
What about exercise?

167
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:02,011
There's a prenatal yoga class
here in town.

168
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:05,048
I hear great things.

169
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:10,487
Before we begin our asanas,

170
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,957
let us welcome Eveleigh
into our prenatal yoga Class.

171
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:21,164
Let us gather around and place
our hands on her manipura.

172
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,034
Using the breath of fire,

173
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:28,938
let us transfer love
and vitality into the child.

174
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,541
Now close your eyes...

175
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:36,279
..and breathe our life chant
into the child within.

176
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:52,529
It's not very Zen
getting groped by strangers.

177
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,265
Oh, I burst out laughing
when they did it to me.

178
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,634
-I'm Sadie.
-Hey, I'm Evey.

179
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,702
Hi.
-How far along are you?

180
00:18:59,704 --> 00:19:01,237
-Three months. You?
-Three.

181
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,106
So I'm craving
all these salty things,

182
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,876
which makes me think I'm having
a little boy, but I don't know.

183
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:10,580
There's a part of me that just
knows we're having a girl.

184
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,115
Aw. I'm craving everything.

185
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,716
The other night
I took a chocolate bar

186
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:17,020
and just stuck it in the middle
of a bowl of ice-cream.

187
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,588
I didn't cut it up or anything.

188
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,290
It was like planting
a chocolate flag.

189
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,692
Sometimes I feel like
I'm losing my mind

190
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,661
completely during
this pregnancy.

191
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,829
Pregnancy is nuts!
You can either let it

192
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:29,098
drive you crazy or just
relax and enjoy the ride.

193
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,768
Give in to the morning sickness
and the stretch marks?

194
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,303
-Can you spare some change?
-Uhh...

195
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:38,241
No. I'm sorry, we're all out.
So sorry.

196
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,208
OK.

197
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,979
- Meth heads.
- Is that a problem around here?

198
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,747
Oh, it's like a plague.

199
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:47,717
Sorry, I...I just
don't feel comfortable

200
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,718
with you riding this bike.

201
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,988
-Oh, I'll be fine, Mom.
-Alright, I'm sure you are.

202
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,324
There's just so many
drunk drivers and meth heads...

203
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,925
-Am I gonna see you on Tuesday?
-Yes!

204
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:58,595
Please don't leave me alone
with those crazy women.

205
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,697
You don't wanna
get groped again?

206
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,933
I will see you then, Evey!

207
00:22:27,377 --> 00:22:30,346
Buenas.
-Bueno.

208
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:47,497
What were you
even doing spying on him?

209
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,232
People come to the country
to be left alone.

210
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:52,835
What if they're cooking crystal
meth right next door, David?

211
00:22:52,837 --> 00:22:55,271
How is that safe for us
or safe for the baby?

212
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,940
Evey, you don't know
what you saw, OK?

213
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,308
It could've been anything.

214
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,011
-Where's my knife?
-So what? We do nothing?

215
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:05,081
Yes, exactly.
It's none of our business.

216
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,917
On my way there, I saw
the ruins of the old house.

217
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,521
Yeah, Emilio said he was gonna
hire some guys to bulldoze it.

218
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,490
But we haven't had time. Why?

219
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:16,826
No reason.

220
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,028
OK.

221
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
David? David!

222
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:00,229
-Oh, God!
-What? What?

223
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:01,964
David, there's
someone out there.

224
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:03,466
Honey, there's
someone out there. Yeah.

225
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:07,503
There's a man in a hood.
He's just out there.

226
00:25:11,441 --> 00:25:14,043
There's nobody out here.

227
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,378
I saw someone.

228
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,447
OK, if he comes back
I'll be on him.

229
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:20,950
-OK?
-Wait. You don't believe me?

230
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:24,687
I didn't say that. No, it's...
Look, it's a new house.

231
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,056
Middle of nowhere,
it's creepy outside.

232
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:30,493
You're expecting...
We're expecting.

233
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:34,330
And, you know...

234
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:37,433
..you went off those meds.

235
00:25:37,634 --> 00:25:40,369
That's what happens.

236
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:44,507
Come on. It was nothing.

237
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:46,676
Come to bed.

238
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,044
You are not crazy.

239
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:52,214
Think of all the tweakers
running around this area.

240
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:54,083
It just... It felt so real.

241
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,952
You have to listen
to your intuition.

242
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:59,288
And who knows? Maybe it could
be your mommy sense kicking in.

243
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,325
Oh, mommy sense?
Is that like Spidey sense?

244
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,492
- Kind of.

245
00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:06,562
Once when I was a baby,
my sister was giving me a bath

246
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,297
and left me there
with the water running

247
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:10,333
and my mom was downstairs
running the vacuum,

248
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,234
obviously couldn't
hear anything,

249
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:13,703
but she just got
this feeling, you know?

250
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:17,740
She ran upstairs and there
I was, underwater drowning.

251
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,343
She just knew. Mommy sense.

252
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:27,216
Yeah, it's mommy sense or
it's something more than that.

253
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:32,188
I was in a car accident
about a year ago.

254
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,656
They said it wasn't my fault,

255
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:39,161
but there was a mother and
a baby in the other car and...

256
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:42,465
..the baby didn't make it.

257
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,468
I'm so sorry.

258
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,637
That's so awful. Jesus Christ.

259
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:50,406
I tried to reach out
to the other family,

260
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:55,611
but they didn't take my calls
and I can't say I blame them.

261
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:59,448
Anyway, then David put me on
an antidepressant because...

262
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,650
Well, I felt like
I was losing my mind.

263
00:27:01,652 --> 00:27:05,254
Obviously, that stopped
once I found out I was pregnant.

264
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,389
Yes. Good. I'm glad.

265
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:10,226
You shouldn't be putting those
chemicals into your body anyway.

266
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,427
I know.

267
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,662
You can't keep
punishing yourself

268
00:27:13,664 --> 00:27:16,699
over something
that is not your fault.

269
00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:18,634
Thank you for being a friend.

270
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:22,638
How about I get you
a chocolate mousse, huh?

271
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:26,175
I'd have a cookie.

272
00:27:44,628 --> 00:27:46,762
David?

273
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

274
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:09,819
Who's there?

275
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,489
Who is it? Who's there?!

276
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,694
Oh, David...

277
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
--Ohh!

278
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,489
-Evey?
-Oh, David, David...

279
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:51,127
-Whoa, whoa. What's going on?
-The wine bottles just exploded!

280
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,462
What?

281
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:56,632
What're you talking about?

282
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,268
They just...

283
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:05,274
But they...
And there was a gun over there.

284
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,681
David, there was
a goddamn gun there!

285
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:20,422
- Hey.
- Hey, David.

286
00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:23,259
Come on in.
Honey, this is Leo Cottrell.

287
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,793
-He lives down the road.
-Hello.

288
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:26,595
When we talked
the other day,

289
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:29,832
I realised I was way overdue
to stop by and say hello.

290
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:34,870
Yeah, Leo runs
a artisanal olive oil business.

291
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:36,639
-Right?
-Yeah. We were talking about it.

292
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,674
I just don't want
any misunderstandings.

293
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,676
You guys should come by
and check it out.

294
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,379
OK. Thanks for stopping by.
Appreciate it.

295
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,881
Yeah, yeah.
I'll see you guys around.

296
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:48,517
-Yeah.
-Alright.

297
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:52,321
I know what I saw.

298
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,456
I know.

299
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,826
This isn't
just seeing things.

300
00:29:57,828 --> 00:30:01,530
These are major hallucinations
we're talking about.

301
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:04,333
The hooded guy, a gun...

302
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:07,403
This is what
we discussed, Eveleigh.

303
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,904
Your pregnant body is basically

304
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:11,674
a cocktail
of competing hormones.

305
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,943
I'm not taking any drugs.

306
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,477
But you were on medication

307
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:17,413
for nearly half a year
after the accident

308
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,448
and it could help you
deal with your symptoms.

309
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,984
And I felt like a zombie
and I wasn't pregnant.

310
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,320
There are very few
side effects with this.

311
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,322
You don't need
to worry about that.

312
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,623
This is a very common
antidepressant.

313
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,326
But I'm not depressed
and we don't know for sure

314
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,895
there are zero side effects -
nobody knows.

315
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:36,332
Evey, we can't live like this.

316
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,667
I can't live like this.

317
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:40,002
I want you to promise me

318
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,605
that if you have
one more hallucination

319
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,340
you go back on your medication.

320
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:48,310
David, we have to put
the baby first now.

321
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:53,849
I'll give
this a minute to open up.

322
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:57,586
I'm not sure I ever drank
anything that needed to open up.

323
00:30:57,588 --> 00:30:58,921
'Drunk'. Whatever.

324
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:02,524
We're on more of a
Two Buck Chuck budget ourselves.

325
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:03,692
That's alright.

326
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:06,495
So when are you gonna
get this winery up and running?

327
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,632
We're close. The problem
out here, though, is rain.

328
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,934
The vines really should
have shoots by now,

329
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,535
but I've been bringing in

330
00:31:13,537 --> 00:31:15,938
two water trucks a week
since we took over.

331
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,673
Water trucks? That sucks.

332
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:21,577
Isn't this supposed to be, like,
the worst drought in decades?

333
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,046
OK, maybe
don't rub it in, Ben.

334
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,914
- I'm just saying!
- It's OK.

335
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:28,917
What about you, Eveleigh?
How do you like the place?

336
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,755
Evey.
-Sorry. What?

337
00:31:32,922 --> 00:31:34,957
She's been a little
out of it recently, so...

338
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:39,662
Well, imagine how out of it I'll
be when I'm medicated, David.

339
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:42,331
Sorry. I didn't mean
to ruin the vibe.

340
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,634
But you can't take medication.
You're pregnant.

341
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:46,702
Thank you.

342
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,804
Ben, why don't I show you
the winery?

343
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,640
I think the ladies
have had enough of us.

344
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:52,675
Yeah, yeah.

345
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,744
-I'm sorry.
-Don't wander off too far.

346
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:57,880
We don't want to send
a search party for you.

347
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:01,984
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-I'm sorry I just did that.

348
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,887
-Ugh!
-No.

349
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:08,090
Ben seems sweet.

350
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,026
Yeah, I think he's a keeper.

351
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:13,829
Sorry, I don't mean to pry,

352
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,932
but what is this about
putting you on medication?

353
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:18,000
Antidepressants.

354
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,502
No, you can't let them
do that to you.

355
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:22,538
Dr Mathison says it's safe.

356
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,374
What do you think?

357
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:28,477
I think there
is something wrong here

358
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,647
and I don't think
I'm imagining it.

359
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:34,983
That's your mommy sense.

360
00:32:34,985 --> 00:32:37,419
Right now,
your protective instincts,

361
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:38,921
they're at an all-time high,

362
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:41,623
so if something
happened in this house

363
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,759
you're way more receptive to it.

364
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:44,893
What do you mean?

365
00:32:44,895 --> 00:32:50,566
I mean...I think this house
might be haunted.

366
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:53,736
Well, I'm disappointed
that the house

367
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,437
isn't living up
to your expectations.

368
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:57,506
That's the understatement
of the year.

369
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,041
Sorry, Glenn,
I just need to know

370
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,610
everything there is
to know about the vineyard.

371
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,446
Mm-hm. Yeah, I did
every search I could think of -

372
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:07,015
police logs,
real estate disclosures -

373
00:33:07,017 --> 00:33:09,385
and there is nothing,

374
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,920
no history of violence,
natural disasters,

375
00:33:11,922 --> 00:33:13,989
agricultural accidents
or any event

376
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:16,859
that might be at the root
of your paranormal activity.

377
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,894
I'm actually surprised
to hear you complain.

378
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:21,530
Most people would
love to be able to say

379
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:22,965
that their house was haunted

380
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,500
by the spirits
of the old winemakers.

381
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:28,036
Da-da-da, blah, blah, blah...
It adds to the romance.

382
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:30,706
What about the ruins
behind the house?

383
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,642
It looked like there used
to be a big old house there.

384
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:37,613
Going back 80 years,
nothing that I could see, no.

385
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,681
It's been zoned for agriculture
the entire time

386
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:41,717
until the Porters
got their building permit

387
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,685
to convert the stable
into a house.

388
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:48,757
Try looking them up.
That would be my recommendation.

389
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:51,660
It's been a pleasure, ladies,
and you let me know

390
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:55,531
if I can do any more
ghostbusting for you.

391
00:34:18,922 --> 00:34:21,523
<i> Hello, Eveleigh.</i>

392
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,894
<i> It's so nice to finally
meet you...meet you...</i>

393
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:33,202
<i> No, no!</i>

394
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:36,939
<i> Don't! No!</i>

395
00:34:39,742 --> 00:34:42,144
<i> No, no, no...</i>

396
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,518
<i> Oh, oh, no!</i>

397
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,160
<i> No! No! Ohh!</i>

398
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:02,498
<i>- Why are you here?
- No!</i>

399
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
<i> No! No! Ohh!</i>
<i>- Why are you here?
- No!</i>
<i> -Arggh!</i>

400
00:35:35,131 --> 00:35:38,200
Honestly, Eileen,
I wish you'd been there.

401
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,101
It was terrifying.

402
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:42,104
<i> Maybe it was
a TV in a neighbour's house.</i>

403
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,673
<i> Sometimes your eyes and ears
can play tricks on you</i>

404
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,208
<i> when you're alone
for too long.</i>

405
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,143
<i> Look, I just think
you have to consider</i>

406
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:49,778
<i> the most reasonable
explanations first.</i>

407
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,215
Sweetheart?
-David's home. I've gotta go.

408
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,050
Have a wonderful time in Paris.

409
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,852
<i> Alright, I'm gonna miss you.</i>

410
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,153
<i> Take care
and focus on your work.</i>

411
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:01,557
<i> I'll see you in a few months.
Oh, tell David what happened!</i>

412
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:06,895
Yeah, right. Alright, fly safe.
'Bye, love.

413
00:36:06,897 --> 00:36:08,096
Hey, honey. How was today?

414
00:36:08,098 --> 00:36:10,232
We replaced all the posts
on the north slope.

415
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:13,669
I had to chase off some more
of those raccoons too.

416
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,736
What are you up to?

417
00:36:14,738 --> 00:36:18,340
I just spoke to Eileen
and she's off to Paris.

418
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,207
Ohh.

419
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:21,109
How much do you know
about the Porters?

420
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:22,911
Not much.
The guy's in prison. Why?

421
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:24,846
Don't you think
it's weird we don't know

422
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:26,815
anything about the people
that lived here before us?

423
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:30,652
-What might have happened here?
-Not really. What's going on?

424
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:33,889
What if what I'm feeling
is not PTSD

425
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:39,962
and it's not hormonal
and it's something...else?

426
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,197
Like what?

427
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:46,335
Something...supernatural.

428
00:36:48,638 --> 00:36:51,740
I don't know. Sweetheart,
let's not even go there.

429
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,775
That's the last thing
you need right now.

430
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:56,244
David, what if something
terrible happened

431
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:58,280
back in the days
of the old house?

432
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:02,951
So, like, what? It's a ghost
that only you can see?

433
00:37:02,953 --> 00:37:04,252
Maybe because of my pregnancy.

434
00:37:04,254 --> 00:37:08,357
Maybe I'm getting,
I don't know, a sixth sense.

435
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,325
Look. Listen to me for a second.

436
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:13,328
You went through something
really tragic last year

437
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,298
and that would be traumatic
for anyone, sweetheart,

438
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,837
and you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

439
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,773
OK, come here. Come on.

440
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:28,944
Ohh...

441
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:31,913
Everything's gonna
be OK, alright?

442
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:35,183
-You promise?
-Yeah, yeah. Listen.

443
00:37:35,185 --> 00:37:36,985
As soon as the baby gets here

444
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:42,157
this is all gonna
seem like a bad dream, OK?

445
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,192
Hey.

446
00:38:10,987 --> 00:38:14,056
No, no.

447
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
OK.

448
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:41,483
- What the hell?!

449
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:50,192
-What did you just do?
-What? Do what?

450
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:54,463
Do what?!

451
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:57,199
God, Evey!

452
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:58,934
This isn't right.

453
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:04,106
If I can't make you see that,
I don't know what else to say.

454
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Evey...

455
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:50,018
Evey? Sweetheart?

456
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,187
What happened? Are you OK?

457
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:55,023
-What happened?
-Ohh...

458
00:40:03,866 --> 00:40:06,501
No, I don't think
there's been any concussion.

459
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:10,438
But the lacerations to her face,
they're not good.

460
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,811
I understand. Yeah, I'm here
with the husband right now.

461
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,947
Yeah, we're both
on the same page.

462
00:40:24,554 --> 00:40:30,192
The baby's gonna be
just fine, alright?

463
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:33,528
I promise.

464
00:40:43,472 --> 00:40:45,540
OK...

465
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:53,949
Morning.

466
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:19,134
The amniotic fluid
level looks great.

467
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,937
Nothing to worry about there.

468
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:26,474
And the due date
is gonna be spot on.

469
00:42:45,461 --> 00:42:47,495
Thanks.

470
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:54,202
-Sadie! Hi!
-Hi!

471
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,137
So good to see you.

472
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:58,473
And I'm so sorry that
I didn't text you back.

473
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:02,544
I felt stupid. I called you,
like, a hundred times.

474
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,579
It's not you.

475
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:05,981
What's going on?

476
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:09,217
Everyone said I did the right
thing by taking the meds.

477
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,752
And they're probably right.

478
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,455
I mean, I'm not seeing things
anymore, which...

479
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,991
It's a good thing, right?

480
00:43:16,392 --> 00:43:17,993
I don't know what to say.

481
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,295
Well, you don't know
what it was like.

482
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,230
I felt like
I was losing my mind.

483
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,032
Yeah, but how do you feel now?

484
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,267
I don't feel completely myself.

485
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:30,305
It's an inhibitor. It stops
my brain from going to extremes.

486
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,774
When I was having visions,
Dr Mathison said

487
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,442
my cortisone levels
were through the roof.

488
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:37,412
It's not his body,
and it's not David's body.

489
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,047
You know who's the one person

490
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,549
who benefits from you taking
these pills right now?

491
00:43:41,551 --> 00:43:43,785
It's your husband.

492
00:43:53,229 --> 00:43:55,163
David?

493
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:07,435
-Hey.
-Hey.

494
00:45:07,437 --> 00:45:09,170
What are you doing in there?

495
00:45:09,172 --> 00:45:10,605
Just looking for you.

496
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:14,742
Oh. I, uh, had to go
down to Edna Valley

497
00:45:14,744 --> 00:45:19,247
and meet with a couple of
big distributors down there.

498
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:20,682
Oh, really?

499
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:23,685
-How did it go?
-It was good.

500
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,867
<i> Hello?
-Oh, hi.</i>

501
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:16,437
<i>-Is this Jane Porter?
-Who is this?</i>

502
00:46:16,439 --> 00:46:18,840
You don't know me.
It's Evey Maddox.

503
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:21,643
I live in your old house
in Paso Robles.

504
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:22,944
<i> Yes?</i>

505
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:23,845
Well, I actually opened

506
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,314
a letter addressed to you
from the library.

507
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:29,250
<i> -You opened my mail?
-Yes, I'm so sorry.</i>

508
00:46:29,252 --> 00:46:30,818
I wouldn't normally do this.

509
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,220
But I saw you checked out

510
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,422
all these books on ghosts
and the supernatural

511
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,692
and I just wondered whether
it had anything to do with

512
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,328
your experience
here at the house.

513
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:44,933
Oh, please, Ms Porter, I know
this sounds completely crazy

514
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:49,204
but, um, I've been seeing things
and hearing things,

515
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:53,675
and, well, nobody believes me
because I'm pregnant.

516
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:56,811
And then Helena Knoll
mentioned you...

517
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:59,547
<i> -You know Helena?
-Yes.</i>

518
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:04,686
<i> At first...I thought
I was losing my mind.</i>

519

<i> Hello, Eveleigh.</i>

520
00:48:07,783 --> 00:48:09,851
Come in.

521
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:15,790
Helena?

522
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,662
I'm sorry for interrupting.

523
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,464
Eveleigh Maddox.
What can I do for you?

524
00:48:23,466 --> 00:48:25,833
Do you remember when
you came to our party,

525
00:48:25,835 --> 00:48:29,871
and I found you in our bedroom
and you seemed...

526
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:33,007
..upset?

527
00:48:37,379 --> 00:48:39,747
I don't remember being upset.

528
00:48:39,749 --> 00:48:41,849
What is it?
What are you here for?

529
00:48:41,851 --> 00:48:43,551
Are you hoping for
an apology or something?

530
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,853
Oh, my gosh!
No, I don't want an apology.

531
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:48,423
I've spoken to Jane Porter.

532
00:48:49,925 --> 00:48:51,759
I'm seeing it too.

533
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:54,962
And I'm scared for my baby.

534
00:48:55,564 --> 00:48:57,565
Come here. I'm gonna help you.

535
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,401
-Don't you worry.
-Will you help me?

536
00:49:02,705 --> 00:49:05,006
Don't worry.

537
00:49:12,348 --> 00:49:15,750
I have what I'd like
to call a sensitive soul.

538
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:19,053
I can see and feel
a lot more than some people.

539
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:22,623
Makes for
a wonderful palate.

540
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:24,826
When I drink wine I can...

541
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:29,831
..feel the grapes and soil
and the weather.

542
00:49:33,836 --> 00:49:35,870
But sometimes...

543
00:49:36,605 --> 00:49:38,639
Sometimes it goes
deeper than that.

544
00:49:38,641 --> 00:49:42,110
I get connected to
a person or a place.

545
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:43,378
It comes out of nowhere.

546
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:48,783
It wraps its fingers around
your heart and won't let go.

547
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:53,087
Did you see something
at the house?

548
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:55,456
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

549
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:59,594
But it was a feeling
of rage, anger, fear -

550
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:02,397
just all swirling up together.

551
00:50:03,665 --> 00:50:08,002
This is the place.
Right here.

552
00:50:08,937 --> 00:50:11,806
Oh, yes.

553
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,776
There's something here.

554
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:17,612
Give me your hands.

555
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:20,681
-Uh...
-Give me your hands.

556
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:24,986
You want to understand it,
right?

557
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:28,923
We have to connect,
we have to gather our energy,

558
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:30,958
be open to
the presence out there.

559
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,196
They want to be seen.
They want to be invited.

560
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,465
Understand?

Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

562
00:51:41,663 --> 00:51:42,597
What was that?

563
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,734
Something happened
on this property.

564
00:51:48,036 --> 00:51:52,507
Something so terrible
it stained the land.

565
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:55,576
I knew
I wasn't going crazy.

566
00:51:55,578 --> 00:51:56,811
I knew it was real.

567
00:51:56,813 --> 00:52:00,248
Certain acts of
psychic violence,

568
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,017
the truly evil ones...

569
00:52:03,852 --> 00:52:06,187
..echo throughout time...

570
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:09,690
..like ripples
spreading across a pond.

571
00:52:14,897 --> 00:52:18,666
Yes? No, I am glad
to hear from you.

572
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:19,634
Just a minute.

573
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:25,106
-It's my daughter. Do you mind?
-Oh, no, no. Go right ahead.

574
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:57,004
Your friends wanna
help you regain control.

Helena?

576
00:53:17,126 --> 00:53:21,195
- What?

577
00:53:39,648 --> 00:53:41,048
--Helena?

578
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:43,618
Helena! Helena, are you OK?

579
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,886
Shh. No, no, don't talk.
I'm gonna get you help.

580
00:53:45,888 --> 00:53:49,156
I'm gonna get you help.
I'm gonna get you help.

581
00:53:49,158 --> 00:53:51,258
--Shh.

582
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,693
<i> 911.
What's your emergency?</i>

583
00:53:52,695 --> 00:53:55,062
Hey, I have a friend
who's having a heart attack.

584
00:53:55,064 --> 00:53:56,764
<i>-Can you send an ambulance?
-OK.</i>

585
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:59,867
<i> Can you confirm your address,
6425 Denmar Street?</i>

586
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:02,036
Yes, yes!

587
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,878
It's not what you think!

588
00:54:13,281 --> 00:54:15,349
It's you!

589
00:54:24,926 --> 00:54:26,661
Oh, God! Helena!

590
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:29,130
No, Helena! No!

591
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:33,968
Oh, my God! Oh, no!
Oh, my God!

592
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,904
Oh, my God!

593
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:35,129
What is that?

594
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,964
Protection.

595
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,733
Protection from what?

596
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:42,169
El maligno. The evil one.

597
00:55:42,171 --> 00:55:46,340
It get much stronger
since you come.

598
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,451
Evey?

599
00:55:59,054 --> 00:56:01,255
-What is this?
-It's nothing.

600
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:02,857
What are you doing?

601
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:03,791
Why do you have this,

602
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:06,227
and what the hell is
this doing in our house?

603
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:08,395
Calm down for one second, OK?

604
00:56:08,397 --> 00:56:10,765
Let me explain.

605
00:56:14,336 --> 00:56:16,937
The workers, OK?
Emilio's people.

606
00:56:16,939 --> 00:56:20,775
They keep giving me
this fertility cult shit,

607
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:21,942
leaving it all over the place.

608
00:56:21,944 --> 00:56:26,213
-Why wouldn't you tell me?
-It's just something farmers do.

609
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:26,947
It's nothing.

610
00:56:26,949 --> 00:56:29,083
I didn't wanna tell you
because I didn't wanna

611
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,484
fill your head with
these crazy stories.

612
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:32,987
-I was worried that...
-Worried that what?

613
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:35,156
That you'd start acting
exactly like you are right now.

614
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,892
Helena and I saw something
in the ruins, baby,

615
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:38,859
and it killed her.

616
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:40,861
-We saw it!
-No, her heart killed her.

617
00:56:40,863 --> 00:56:42,863
She had a pre-existing
heart condition.

618
00:56:42,865 --> 00:56:45,432
OK. Whatever you want
to think is fine.

619
00:56:45,434 --> 00:56:48,102
Just come with me. Let's
just leave the house, please!

620
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:52,072
We've sunk everything
we have into this!

621
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:57,411
I'm sorry.

622
00:56:59,114 --> 00:57:00,514
This is our dream.

623
00:57:00,516 --> 00:57:03,017
This is not a dream.

624
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,485
This is a nightmare!

625
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:07,254
There is something wrong
in this house.

626
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:09,490
-I'm gonna prove it to you.
-Evey...

627
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:13,260
No, I'm not coming back here
ever again!

628
00:57:32,314 --> 00:57:35,015
<i> Hey, it's Sadie.
Leave me a message.</i>

629
00:57:35,017 --> 00:57:37,585
Oh, hey. This is Evey.

630
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:41,121
You were right about everything.

631
00:57:41,123 --> 00:57:43,891
About the drugs, about David.

632
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,426
I'm leaving for L.A.

633
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:46,961
I just gotta do one thing first.

634
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,030
But I'm so sorry that we fought
the last time I saw you,

635
00:57:50,032 --> 00:57:51,532
and call me back.

636
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,601
OK. 'Bye.

637
00:58:25,334 --> 00:58:29,236
I'm sorry to hear about Helena.

638
00:58:30,438 --> 00:58:31,005
Yeah.

639
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,140
I didn't realise until
I looked at the bottle

640
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:34,909
that your family
used to live on our land.

641
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:37,578
Oh, yes, but that was
over a hundred years ago.

642
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:42,049
Um, there's one with
a good label here.

643
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:45,552
Here we go.

644
00:58:45,554 --> 00:58:47,121
"Folgore."

645
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:49,490
You can
see the house clearly.

646
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:52,092
It was the best estate
in the valley.

647
00:58:52,094 --> 00:58:55,396
Did anything strange
ever happen to your family

648
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:57,698
when they were living there?

649
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,301
Uh, well, um...

650
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:06,473
My great-grandfather
built the place in 1881.

651
00:59:08,043 --> 00:59:11,045
Family lore has it that...

652
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,246
..soon after they moved in,

653
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,148
they began experiencing
these strange events -

654
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,251
these whistling sounds
and pounding on doors,

655
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:18,485
things they couldn't explain.

656
00:59:18,487 --> 00:59:21,155
Did they ever find out
why it was happening?

657
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:22,623
Oh, I don't know.

658
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:23,624
All this was told to me

659
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:26,427
when I was a little boy
by my grandmother.

660
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:28,228
In any case, um...

661
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:29,463
They eventually moved out

662
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:32,433
and my great-grandmother
lit the place on fire.

663
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:33,968
If she couldn't live there,

664
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:37,171
she didn't want anybody else
to live there either.

665
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:43,110
You know, there's something that
perhaps you would like to see.

666
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,679
Let me go and get that.

667
00:59:50,552 --> 00:59:52,286
My great-grandmother
was a tough cookie

668
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:54,621
and she wasn't gonna let go
of the house easily.

669
00:59:54,623 --> 00:59:59,393
So she hired a medium
to cleanse the place.

670
01:00:02,998 --> 01:00:08,235
Now, the story goes that
the medium went into a trance

671
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:12,072
to try to contact the spirits
that were trapped in the house.

672
01:00:12,074 --> 01:00:17,611
And these are some of
the sketches she did.

673
01:00:50,578 --> 01:00:53,347
David!

674
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:58,052
That's David!

675
01:01:00,188 --> 01:01:01,688
David, it's us.

676
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,524
A medium saw us
living in the house.

677
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:06,460
<i> -What are you talking about?
-I've got her drawings!</i>

678
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:09,496
<i> -Don't get hysterical.
-I'm not hysterical.</i>

679
01:01:09,498 --> 01:01:11,298
<i>-I've got proof.
-Calm down.</i>

680
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,068
Honey, you have to come and meet
me and get out of the house.

681
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,704
<i> But you have to come and
pick me up. You have my car.</i>

682
01:01:17,706 --> 01:01:20,274
I'm not going back
inside the house.

683
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:21,408
<i> Give me some time to pack</i>

684
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,310
<i> and give Emilio instructions
while we're gone.</i>

685
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:27,614
<i> Call me when you get here and
I'll come out. I love you.</i>

686
01:02:03,818 --> 01:02:06,120
Pick up.

687
01:02:08,123 --> 01:02:10,157
Pick up!

688
01:02:22,904 --> 01:02:24,872
David?

689
01:02:27,308 --> 01:02:29,643
-David?
-Yeah.

690
01:02:31,646 --> 01:02:34,381
Eileen?

691
01:02:36,584 --> 01:02:39,486
-What are you...
-It's OK, sweetheart.

692
01:02:39,488 --> 01:02:40,654
Everything's OK.

693
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:43,290
What's everybody doing here?

694
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:45,859
We're here 'cause we love you.

695
01:02:45,861 --> 01:02:47,528
David asked us
to come over tonight

696
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:51,932
just to help you get through
this tough time.

697
01:02:54,536 --> 01:02:56,937
A goddamn intervention, David?

698
01:02:56,939 --> 01:03:02,509
Think of it as a support system.

699
01:03:03,311 --> 01:03:06,947
Who's she? I saw you
with her outside the cafe.

700
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,584
This is Victoria Lambert.
She's a family therapist.

701
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:11,718
And we asked her here tonight

702
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,554
just because we think
she can help you.

703
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:17,925
Hello, Eveleigh.
So nice to finally meet you.

704
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:18,592
Oh...

705
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:22,629
Listen, I just want everything
to be OK for you and the baby.

706
01:03:22,631 --> 01:03:24,498
Your friends wanna
help you regain control.

707
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,734
OK, shut up. We need to leave
and we need to leave right now!

708
01:03:27,736 --> 01:03:29,436
Victoria's actually
offered to let you

709
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,205
stay at her ranch
until the due date.

710
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:32,673
You can just relax
the rest of the term.

711
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:36,376
I don't wanna stay at the ranch,
David! We have to go and now!

712
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:39,613
- Just calm down.

713
01:03:40,715 --> 01:03:42,816
What?

714
01:03:58,399 --> 01:04:01,301
Sorry. I was making some tea.

715
01:04:01,303 --> 01:04:03,971
It's tonight!

716
01:04:06,975 --> 01:04:09,843
Uh, yeah,
she's a little panicky

717
01:04:09,845 --> 01:04:13,480
but I think she knows
it's for her own good.

718
01:04:13,781 --> 01:04:16,350
No, we should be there
in about two hours.

719
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:19,987
Yes, David's agreed.

720
01:04:24,626 --> 01:04:25,525
It's tonight!

721
01:04:25,527 --> 01:04:29,029
-What's wrong, sweetheart?
-We were wrong, we were wrong!

722
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,832
It's tonight.
It's tonight, David!

723
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:34,401
-What are you talking about?
-David, it's happening.

724
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:36,270
It's happening tonight!
We need to leave!

725
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:39,373
-OK, just calm down.
-Everybody, we need to leave!

726
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,775
- We have to leave now!

727
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:45,612
-No, don't answer the door!
-Just stop!

728
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:51,318
Just stop.

729
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,053
David...

730
01:05:03,564 --> 01:05:07,734
We were driving to the hospital.
My water broke.

731
01:05:07,736 --> 01:05:10,937
And I don't think I can
make it to the hospital.

732
01:05:10,939 --> 01:05:14,341
-Come on in.
-Come on, come on, it's OK.

733
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:17,511
-No, no, no!
-I'm a doctor.

734
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,646
No, no, no, no!

735
01:05:22,016 --> 01:05:23,984
I'm calling the police!
Give it to me!

736
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:26,019
David, listen.
You don't understand.

737
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:28,755
There is no ghost.
I was having premonitions.

738
01:05:28,757 --> 01:05:30,557
You're not making any sense
right now, OK?

739
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,526
No, don't you see?
Helena figured it out.

740
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:34,061
When something
truly terrible happens,

741
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:36,430
it causes ripples in time,
but they can go both ways!

742
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,433
The Napolis, the Porters,
they were all having

743
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:40,434
premonitions of one night -

744
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,370
and it's this night,
David, don't you see?

745
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,539
We are the haunting!

746
01:05:50,678 --> 01:05:54,915
Sadie...what are you doing up?
You alright?

747
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,750
Is everything OK?

748
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:59,619
Not really, no.

749
01:06:02,957 --> 01:06:03,890
Sadie...

750
01:06:03,892 --> 01:06:07,094
I need you to put
that phone down, David.

751
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:09,996
Put down the phone.

752
01:06:10,531 --> 01:06:11,565
OK. It's alright.

753
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:14,501
Come on, follow me
back in the living room.

754
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:17,838
-What? What...
-Come on.

755
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,574
Come on, faster.

756
01:06:23,911 --> 01:06:27,114
Give me your phone.
Give me your phone!

757
01:06:29,784 --> 01:06:33,053
-Please... Please don't do this.
-Sit down!

758
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:35,055
-Evey.
-Why are you doing this?

759
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:38,625
You haven't figured it out
by now, Evey?

760
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:41,128
You are so stupid.

761
01:07:16,764 --> 01:07:21,101
You alright? Come on. Come on!

762
01:07:22,437 --> 01:07:24,471
Shit! I got her!

763
01:07:27,175 --> 01:07:30,043
Give me that phone!

764
01:07:51,933 --> 01:07:53,567
Sadie!

765
01:08:51,259 --> 01:08:54,194
-David! David!
-Run.

766
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:57,230
-David!
-Get help.

767
01:08:57,232 --> 01:08:59,666
-OK.
-Go!

768
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:06,740
No! No!

769
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:10,644
-Why are you here?
-No! No!

770
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:14,748
-You shouldn't have come here.
-Eileen.

771
01:09:34,769 --> 01:09:36,303
--Whoa! Whoa!

772
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:38,605
-Shh! What's wrong?
-Leo!

773
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:40,707
No, no, we've gotta go!
We have to go!

774
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:43,143
-OK, calm down.
-You don't understand!

775
01:11:14,068 --> 01:11:17,704
I got her. I got her, I got her.

776
01:11:20,808 --> 01:11:24,411
No, no, no, no. I need you
to keep still for the baby.

777
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:27,380
--It's gonna be OK.

778
01:11:27,382 --> 01:11:30,817
I should've figured
it out sooner.

779
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:33,119
It WAS your mommy
sense kicking in.

780
01:11:33,121 --> 01:11:36,823
But it's OK now, because
she's gonna live with us

781
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:39,292
and she's gonna have
such a nice life.

782
01:11:39,294 --> 01:11:41,461
I'm gonna make it alright now.

783
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:47,200
Because you,
YOU stole my baby from me!

784
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:51,404
That's right, it was me.

785
01:12:10,424 --> 01:12:12,158
Yes, that's right.

786
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,127
They said I couldn't
have a child.

787
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:17,197
They said I couldn't conceive,
but I did.

788
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:20,100
And he was such
a beautiful little boy.

789
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:22,736
He was my whole life.
He was my hero.

790
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:24,471
He was my little miracle baby.

791
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:28,141
And then you came along
and you took him from me!

792
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:29,409
You did, you killed my baby!

793
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:33,213
And then I went online and I saw
what a perfect life you had.

794
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:37,817
And then I saw you were
pregnant, and then I knew.

795
01:12:37,819 --> 01:12:39,219
I knew it was the universe

796
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:40,453
putting it all
back together again,

797
01:12:40,455 --> 01:12:45,425
because I'm gonna give her such
a wonderful, beautiful home,

798
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:48,394
and it's all gonna be OK.

799
01:12:48,396 --> 01:12:50,930
I need the bag now, OK?

800
01:12:50,932 --> 01:12:52,932
I need you to be
brave for the baby.

801
01:12:52,934 --> 01:12:54,834
I need you to stay
calm for the baby.

802
01:12:54,836 --> 01:12:57,537
- Stay strong for the baby, OK?

803
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:01,341
Don't worry, Eveleigh!
No, no, no! For the baby!

804
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,310
I need you to stay calm
for the baby, OK?

805
01:13:04,312 --> 01:13:09,182
Shh. Give me the scalpel.
Come on, come on, come on.

806
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:11,484
OK, OK, OK. Shh.

807
01:13:11,486 --> 01:13:14,220
Uh...
-Shh.

808
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:16,422
Oh, Jesus.

809
01:13:16,424 --> 01:13:19,392
--Yes. Shh.

810
01:13:19,394 --> 01:13:21,427
Wait, uh...

811
01:13:22,163 --> 01:13:24,130
I don't know if I can...

812
01:13:24,132 --> 01:13:27,200
It's OK. It's OK.
I don't need you.

813
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:32,972
We don't need him, do we?
It's just us mommies now.

814
01:13:32,974 --> 01:13:35,041
I can do this.

815
01:13:37,445 --> 01:13:41,815
Hi, baby. Hi, baby.

816
01:13:46,453 --> 01:13:50,523
I just need you to stay
really still right now.

817
01:13:50,525 --> 01:13:53,126
Just be really quiet.

818
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:55,128
And it's all gonna be OK.

819
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:58,965
- Alright?

820
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:09,342
OK. Here we start.

821
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:18,952
I can do this, OK?

822
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:35,401
- Sadie?

823
01:14:38,305 --> 01:14:41,174
Sadie! Baby?

824
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:44,077
What did you do?

825
01:14:48,649 --> 01:14:50,884
What did you do?

826
01:14:51,485 --> 01:14:55,021
We were gonna start a family!

827
01:14:59,427 --> 01:15:01,327
Ah!

828
01:15:11,538 --> 01:15:13,940
David!

829
01:15:18,979 --> 01:15:22,181
Oh, honey, you need help.

830
01:15:23,017 --> 01:15:25,652
I called an ambulance.

831
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:35,528
It was under the table...

832
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:39,132
..right where
you said it would be.

833
01:15:54,982 --> 01:15:56,716
I think you're
gonna be glad

834
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:59,252
you came all the way out here.

835
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:05,058
It's a one-of-a-kind property.

836
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,994
See, these floorboards here
are vintage oak.

837
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:10,530
You have floor-to-ceiling
views here.

838
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:13,499
Oh, and you mentioned
that your husband is

839
01:16:13,501 --> 01:16:15,268
a fan of ghost stories, yeah?

840
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:17,136
It's funny that
that's brought up,

841
01:16:17,138 --> 01:16:20,573
because this house has
a very interesting reputation.
