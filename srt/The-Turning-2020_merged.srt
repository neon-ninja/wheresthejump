00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:36,355
Okay. Okay, okay.

3
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:38,089
Okay. Oh, come on.

4
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:39,924
Come on, open.

5
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:43,061
No. Shit. Shit!

6
00:01:43,063 --> 00:01:44,929
Oh, God.

7
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:52,103
Okay.

8
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:13,124
A memorial
service for Kurt Cobain

9
00:02:13,126 --> 00:02:15,960
was held today in Seattle,
two days

10
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:18,797
after the musician was found
dead of an apparent suicide.

11
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:24,403
That's not how
fancy nannies dress.

12
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:25,837
Come on, I'll take them.

13
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,906
I'm a private tutor.

14
00:02:27,908 --> 00:02:29,174
Okay.

15
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:31,743
Least you could do,

16
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:33,078
leaving me without a roommate.

17
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,080
I'm sorry for the short notice.

18
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:36,881
They-they need me tomorrow.

19
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:37,916
What about your class?

20
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:39,717
I thought you love those kids.

21
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,985
I do, but...

22
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:43,721
the school's the one
that put me up for it.

23
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:52,730
Look, I couldn't say no, okay?

24
00:02:52,732 --> 00:02:55,200
A few years ago, this
little girl lost her parents.

25
00:02:55,202 --> 00:02:58,002
And then now
her nanny just abandoned her.

26
00:02:58,004 --> 00:03:00,138
So you're ditching me
for a seven-year-old.

27
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,209
You don't know what it's like
to grow up without parents.

28
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,844
Okay.

29
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:07,212
And I love teaching, but...

30
00:03:07,214 --> 00:03:11,151
I want to make a difference,
you know?

31
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:18,091
So, you taking those with you?

32
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:22,461
No.

33
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:24,162
I think I'm kind of...
looking forward

34
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:25,997
to having a little break
from these.

35
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:28,233
She's been having
a bad spell lately.

36
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:31,171
But I'm gonna go see her
tomorrow and say goodbye.

37
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:39,210
Here.

38
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,945
Are you gonna be okay
when you're up there?

39
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:42,046
My God.

40
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:43,948
I'm going
from 25 screaming kids

41
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,717
to one little girl.

42
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:48,052
How hard can it be?

43
00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:23,690
Hi, Mom.

44
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:28,895
What are you working on?

45
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:34,799
Hey, what if I help you
move your stuff back

46
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:35,735
into the art room?

47
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:44,976
So...

48
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:47,011
I'm leaving today.

49
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:50,014
For the... the new job.

50
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:51,883
You remember? I told you
about that little girl,

51
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:54,285
all alone with her housekeeper.

52
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:56,287
Little girl?

53
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:57,857
All on her own?

54
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,858
Yeah.

55
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,894
Well, that's
a big responsibility.

56
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:04,896
I know.

57
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:07,399
I can handle it.

58
00:05:09,403 --> 00:05:12,003
You look...

59
00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:13,740
nice.

60
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:16,307
Thank you.

61
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:18,142
Here. Take this.

62
00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:19,811
It'll keep you warm.

63
00:05:34,094 --> 00:05:35,893
Okay.

64
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:43,770
Love you.

65
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:49,102
This can't be real.

66
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:41,380
Flora leaves
her toys everywhere.

67
00:08:41,382 --> 00:08:43,114
Don't be surprised if you find

68
00:08:43,116 --> 00:08:45,784
a Little Mermaid
in your toilet.

69
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:49,086
You must be Kate.

70
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:51,055
Yes. Hi.

71
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:53,358
Come along.

72
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,495
Oh.

73
00:08:55,563 --> 00:08:57,463
Are you Mrs. Grose?

74
00:08:57,465 --> 00:08:59,096
I am.

75
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:02,268
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

76
00:09:09,343 --> 00:09:11,175
And it's just the two
of you here?

77
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:14,379
Cleaners and the gardener
come in every couple of weeks.

78
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:16,113
But, yes, it's just me

79
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:19,150
and Flora
while Miles is away at school.

80
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:22,989
And this is where you'll
give Flora her lessons.

81
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,058
Have you ever been
a live-in governess?

82
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,060
No, no, not since the 1800s.

83
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:32,364
Is that a joke?

84
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:35,134
No, no, not a funny one.

85
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:38,337
This is my first live-in job.

86
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:39,671
Ah.

87
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,573
Well, I hope
you know what you're doing.

88
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:46,310
The children are
very special, Kate.

89
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:48,447
They're thoroughbreds.

90
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:50,449
Now, come along.

91
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:53,253
I have something on the stove.

92
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:56,320
It's so quiet.

93
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:58,322
All the better to hear you
when you get lost.

94
00:09:58,324 --> 00:09:59,858
Is that a joke?

95
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,428
No.

96
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:05,464
Mmm.

97
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:07,466
That smells so good.

98
00:10:07,468 --> 00:10:10,167
I made this soup
for Flora's father

99
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:11,436
when he was her age.

100
00:10:11,438 --> 00:10:14,105
Oh, you've been with the family
for that long?

101
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:15,576
- That's quite a commitment.
- It's an honor...

102
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,446
...is what it is.

103
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:25,651
And may I ask
how the parents died?

104
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:28,453
They died
in a tragic car accident,

105
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:30,321
just outside the gate.

106
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:33,157
Flora saw the whole thing.

107
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,595
- That's awful.
- Yes, it is.

108
00:10:35,696 --> 00:10:38,298
And it's hard for the children.

109
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:40,532
Well,

110
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:43,200
growing up
without parents is...

111
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:47,472
My father left
when I was Flora's age,

112
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:48,609
so...

113
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:52,413
Is that right?

114
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,349
Mmm.

115
00:10:57,685 --> 00:10:59,317
I'd love to meet Flora.

116
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:01,420
Where might I find her?

117
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:03,422
She's down at the stables.

118
00:11:03,424 --> 00:11:07,359
Just take the path
around the back.

119
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:08,696
Ah.

120
00:11:10,364 --> 00:11:12,497
Uh, may I?

121
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:14,535
Of course.

122
00:11:34,788 --> 00:11:37,524
Flora?

123
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:03,982
Flora?

124
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:07,719
It's Kate.

125
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:10,189
I came to say hi.

126
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

127
00:12:33,414 --> 00:12:34,615
Flora?

128
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:44,491
Flora?

129
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

130
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:06,611
Hi.

131
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:09,381
Hi.

132
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:10,582
Where were you hiding?

133
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:12,651
Like I'd tell.

134
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:16,621
Geez. He's not very friendly, is he?

135
00:13:16,623 --> 00:13:17,856
His name's Samson.

136
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:20,291
He's grumpy <i>all</i> the time.

137
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:23,061
He only lets Miles ride him.

138
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:25,330
Ah. Ooh.

139
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:26,865
And who's this?

140
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:28,633
This is Delilah.

141
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:31,603
She was my mother's horse.

142
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:34,740
You can pet her on the nose
if you want.

143
00:13:34,742 --> 00:13:36,307
Just be gentle, okay?

144
00:13:37,911 --> 00:13:39,678
She wants your apple.

145
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,316
How did you know that?

146
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,723
She is my favorite horse.

147
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:54,726
Did you know that apples
have cyanide in them?

148
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:57,329
And the seeds are poisonous.

149
00:13:57,331 --> 00:13:59,931
No, I did not know that.

150
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:01,833
How did you know that?

151
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:04,536
She told me.

152
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:08,673
Dr. Felicity Peppercorn
Clock Watch.

153
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:10,675
Oh.
Nice to meet you, Felicity.

154
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:12,511
That's quite a name.

155
00:14:12,513 --> 00:14:14,479
She's a veterinarian.

156
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:15,814
Is that what you want to be?

157
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:17,582
Or maybe a chef.

158
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:18,750
- You could be both.
- I would have

159
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:20,886
to be a vegetarian.

160
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:22,587
- Why is that?
- I can't save animals,

161
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:24,356
then eat them.

162
00:14:24,358 --> 00:14:25,957
Very true.

163
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,693
Come on.

164
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:31,129
Hold on.

165
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,597
Wow.

166
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:34,933
This maze is very complicated.

167
00:14:34,935 --> 00:14:37,602
Yeah. It's so big.

168
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:39,671
You need to know
your way around,

169
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:42,674
or you'll get lost.

170
00:14:42,676 --> 00:14:45,410
One time, I couldn't find
my way out,

171
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:47,445
and I almost starved to death.

172
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:49,414
What?

173
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,551
Geez, your friends
must love it here.

174
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:55,754
I don't have any friends.

175
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:57,656
You have no friends?

176
00:14:57,658 --> 00:14:59,457
Nope.

177
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,660
Well, you might have one now.

178
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:03,461
- Maybe.
- "Maybe."

179
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:06,598
Okay. I'll work for it.

180
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:11,703
Okay. So, what,
you're in ninth grade? Tenth?

181
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:13,405
- Second.
- Second?

182
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,740
- Wow.
- I could've skipped a grade if I wanted.

183
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:18,743
Miss Jessel said
I was an exceptional student.

184
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:21,012
Wait, who's Miss Jessel?

185
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:23,515
My teacher before you.

186
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:25,016
She taught me French, you know.

187
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:26,618
She did?

188
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,753
Come on, slowpoke.

189
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:32,190
And this mirror's
from the 1980s.

190
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:34,192
- Ooh.
- That's my great-

191
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:37,696
great-great-great-aunt
Louisiana and her dog Otis.

192
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:41,766
And that's the ship
her brother died on.

193
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:42,870
Guess what he had.

194
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:46,972
He had dentistry.

195
00:15:46,974 --> 00:15:49,207
Dysentery?

196
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,910
Yeah, that's what I said.

197
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:57,883
That's Miles' room.

198
00:15:57,885 --> 00:16:00,752
And that's mine, next to it.

199
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:03,924
Wait, wait.
What's down there?

200
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:08,693
That's the east wing.

201
00:16:08,695 --> 00:16:11,663
I don't go
in that part of the house.

202
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:12,864
Why not?

203
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,868
Don't wanna.

204
00:16:25,512 --> 00:16:27,512
This is your room.

205
00:16:27,514 --> 00:16:29,514
I hope you like the bedding.

206
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:30,782
This is my room?

207
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:31,883
Yep.

208
00:16:31,885 --> 00:16:33,551
Wow.

209
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:34,886
This is all for me?

210
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:35,987
Yep.

211
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:37,522
Oh.

212
00:16:37,524 --> 00:16:39,557
This is my great-grandmother
Sophie.

213
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,825
You stuffed your grandma?

214
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:42,827
No, silly head.

215
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:44,896
It's just supposed
to look like her.

216
00:16:44,898 --> 00:16:45,997
Oh, I see.

217
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:47,832
Well, she's, uh...

218
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,968
she's creepy, huh?

219
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,036
I think she's pretty.

220
00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:53,038
Do you want
to see something else?

221
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,973
Yeah.

222
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:57,709
Behold!

223
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:01,581
My great-grandmother's
sewing room.

224
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,987
My mother used to take me
shopping when I was little.

225
00:17:08,989 --> 00:17:10,889
But after she died,

226
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:14,125
Miss Jessel started making
all of my clothes for me.

227
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:16,795
Well, that one's beautiful.

228
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:20,565
Miss Jessel never got to finish
this one before she left.

229
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:22,133
It was for my birthday.

Um... yeah.

236
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:39,751
Miles did that.

237
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:42,055
I told him it was tacky.

238
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:45,857
Yikes.

00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:48,093
Now, eat it all up.

00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:50,962
- Oh.
- I have an idea.

241
00:17:50,964 --> 00:17:54,666
What if you and I took
a little field trip

242
00:17:54,668 --> 00:17:56,968
to go get some ice cream
before class started tomorrow?

243
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,770
Uh, no.

244
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:00,339
Flora doesn't leave
the property.

245
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:01,906
She has everything
she needs here.

246
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:03,775
What?

247
00:18:03,777 --> 00:18:04,843
Don't you, darling?

248
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:07,979
She prefers
my French apple tart,

249
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:10,181
with a little bit of cream
on the side.

250
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:11,950
And you don't have
to go anywhere for that.

251
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:13,352
Do you, darling?

252
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:16,623
No.

253
00:18:54,895 --> 00:18:56,961
You're gonna leave me,
aren't you?

254
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:59,699
What are you talking about?

255
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:04,235
Miss Jessel left
without saying goodbye.

256
00:19:04,237 --> 00:19:07,707
And now she won't talk
to me anymore.

257
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:10,975
You know,

258
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:14,181
some people have a really
hard time saying goodbye.

259
00:19:15,715 --> 00:19:17,682
But I bet she did it the way

260
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:19,851
she thought would be best
for both of you.

261
00:19:19,853 --> 00:19:21,822
Well, it's not easy for me.

262
00:19:25,158 --> 00:19:27,127
Let's get you to bed.

263
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:35,733
Mm.

264
00:19:35,735 --> 00:19:37,836
Okay.

265
00:19:37,838 --> 00:19:39,671
Tucked in?

266
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:45,043
- I like you.
- I like you.

267
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:47,212
And I'm not going anywhere.

268
00:19:47,214 --> 00:19:49,948
Promise, promise?

269
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,050
Cross my heart and hope to die.

270
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:53,885
Stick a needle in your eye?

271
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:55,787
Mm. No. No, no.

272
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:57,922
Maybe not that part.

273
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Upcoming jump scare (Major)
Okay.

274
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

275
00:20:53,947 --> 00:20:55,280
Oh, God.

276
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:12,933
You are terrifying.

277
00:21:55,343 --> 00:21:57,077
So weird.

278
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
God.

279
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:42,053
Shh... stop.

280
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:53,601
- Come here.
- Peter.

281
00:23:12,152 --> 00:23:14,287
What are you doing
in here? How did you get here?

282
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:30,036
I said you need to leave now.

283
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:34,238
You're gonna wake the children.

284
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,409
The children are asleep.

285
00:23:42,516 --> 00:23:44,350
Don't touch me.

286
00:23:44,352 --> 00:23:46,117
No one needs to know.

287
00:24:04,338 --> 00:24:05,970
Please stop.

288
00:24:05,972 --> 00:24:07,408
Keep your eyes closed.

289
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:10,276
In here.

290
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:13,445
Just get in bed with me.

291
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:15,416
No, Peter.

292
00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:24,224
Stop, you're scaring me.

293
00:24:31,197 --> 00:24:34,031
You're hurting me.

294
00:24:34,033 --> 00:24:36,502
You better go.

295
00:24:36,504 --> 00:24:38,136
Last kiss.

296
00:24:38,138 --> 00:24:40,138
Stop it.

297
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,306
Please go.
Leave me alone.

298
00:24:42,308 --> 00:24:45,276
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're hurting me.

299
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:47,011

00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:27,051
I'm Miles.
I live here.

I mean, um...

303
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:33,459
uh, what are you doing home?

00:25:33,461 --> 00:25:35,360

I thought I... heard something.

307
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:44,168

I'm really sorry about
last night. Uh, I didn't...

335
00:27:27,608 --> 00:27:29,474
I didn't mean
to be rude or anything.

336
00:27:29,476 --> 00:27:31,376
Sorry if I scared you.

337
00:27:31,378 --> 00:27:33,478
Oh, it's fine.

338
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,247
Cool.

339
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:38,350
So, seems like
you had a rough night.

340
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:40,217
You're a sleepwalker,
like Flora.

341
00:27:40,219 --> 00:27:42,186
- I don't sleepwalk.
- How would you know, silly?

342
00:27:42,188 --> 00:27:45,156
You're asleep the whole time.

343
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:46,525
I just know.

344
00:27:46,527 --> 00:27:49,361
- That's a cool sweater.
- Thanks.

345
00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:51,195
You shouldn't be wearing that.

346
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:52,531
He wanted me to have it.

347
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:55,232
- Was it your dad's?
- It was Quint's.

348
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:58,370
- Who's Quint?
- He was the riding instructor.

349
00:27:58,372 --> 00:27:59,638
He managed the estate.

350
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,272
He was the best.

351
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:02,676
Oh, and he's not here anymore?

352
00:28:03,777 --> 00:28:05,644
He died.

353
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:07,412
Oh.

354
00:28:07,414 --> 00:28:09,548
Everyone dies, Miles.

355
00:28:15,456 --> 00:28:17,689
So, do you ride horses?

356
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:20,459
Oh. Uh, well, I rode a couple
times at summer camp.

357
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:21,960
Hello. Fairchild residence.

358
00:28:21,962 --> 00:28:24,228
But that's a lie.
I just stayed on the horse.

359
00:28:26,232 --> 00:28:28,265
- I can teach you if you want.
- Yeah?

360
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:30,535
- Who?
- I mean, if you can handle it.

361
00:28:30,537 --> 00:28:32,303
Oh, is that a challenge?

362
00:28:32,305 --> 00:28:33,672
Yeah.

363
00:28:33,674 --> 00:28:35,540
Uh, no, I think
I can handle it.

364
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:37,241
- Please hold.
- Yeah, I'm a...

365
00:28:37,243 --> 00:28:39,444
- I'm a quick learner.
- Kate!

366
00:28:39,446 --> 00:28:42,414
It's the headmaster
at Miles' school.

367
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:46,283
He would like to speak with
the person in charge of us.

368
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:47,552
Uh...

369
00:28:47,554 --> 00:28:49,456
Yes, fine.

370
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:52,493
Better take that.

371
00:28:58,297 --> 00:29:00,297
Hello. This is Kate.

372
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:03,702
So, Miss Flora, are you
forgetting your breakfast?

373
00:29:03,704 --> 00:29:05,570
- Uh, I...
- Yes?

374
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:07,306
Well, let me cut it up for you.

375
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:15,312
Okay.

376
00:29:15,314 --> 00:29:17,649
Um, thank you
for letting us know.

377
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,431
So, what did old,

378
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:33,801
uh, fragile Farty want?

379
00:29:37,337 --> 00:29:39,473
He, um...

380
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:46,277
He gave me a list
of some of your schoolwork

381
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:48,214
to complete while you're home.

382
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:51,483
Okay.

383
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:53,487
That sounds fun.

384
00:29:55,723 --> 00:29:57,522
Great.

385
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,326
Where are you going?

386
00:30:01,328 --> 00:30:03,628
To my room.

387
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,896
What about your plate?

388
00:30:04,898 --> 00:30:07,599
- What?
- Your plate.

389
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:09,534
Aren't you gonna take it
to the kitchen?

390
00:30:09,536 --> 00:30:12,571
Want me to cut the grass, too?

391
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:14,406
No.

392
00:30:14,408 --> 00:30:16,475
But Mrs. Grose prepared
a beautiful breakfast for us,

393
00:30:16,477 --> 00:30:18,510
and it would be
the polite thing to do.

394
00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:20,779
That's her job, right?

395
00:30:20,781 --> 00:30:22,881
- Miles.
- It's fine, Miles.

396
00:30:22,883 --> 00:30:24,516
I'll do it, darling.

397
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:26,485
You go on ahead.

398
00:30:26,487 --> 00:30:28,854
Come on, Flora.

399
00:30:28,856 --> 00:30:31,423
Let's go.

400
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:33,393
It's not your job either,
Flora.

401
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,801
They were born
into privilege, Kate.

402
00:30:42,803 --> 00:30:44,836
Can you please remember that?

403
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:47,541
Miles was expelled.

404
00:30:49,743 --> 00:30:51,710
He attacked another student.

405
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:53,678
He what?

406
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,680
Yes, apparently
a teacher found him

407
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:59,484
with his hands around
another boy's neck, slamming

408
00:30:59,486 --> 00:31:00,919
his head
into the bathroom tile.

409
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:04,689
Oh, absolutely not.

410
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:07,726
No, he wouldn't do that.

411
00:31:07,728 --> 00:31:10,829
He did, and it sounds
like he's very lucky

412
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:13,433
that the other boy's family
isn't pressing charges.

413
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:16,635
Yes, well, other boys, Kate,

414
00:31:16,637 --> 00:31:18,705
have always been jealous
of Miles.

415
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:24,444
- Here, let me help you.
- No, thank you.

416
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:27,548
This is my job.

417
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:30,551
You do yours.

418
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:54,873
And what's that lava

419
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:58,443
that sits
in the volcano called?

420
00:31:58,445 --> 00:32:00,879
Um... it's magma.

421
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:03,415
Mm. Yeah. Ouch.

422
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:05,953
It is "ouch." Super hot.

423
00:32:14,995 --> 00:32:16,995
Flora?

424
00:32:16,997 --> 00:32:18,730
Yeah?

425
00:32:18,732 --> 00:32:21,466
Does Miles get
in trouble a lot?

426
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,570
Miles is the best.

427
00:32:37,951 --> 00:32:39,951
Stop it!

428
00:32:39,953 --> 00:32:42,721
Thank you.

429
00:32:42,723 --> 00:32:44,691
Flora, back to work.

430
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:22,060
Miles?

431
00:33:22,062 --> 00:33:23,929
Don't you know how to knock?

432
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:27,532
Do you have a friend in here?

433
00:33:27,534 --> 00:33:29,803
What do you want?

434
00:33:31,772 --> 00:33:34,673
Sorry. I thought
I saw someone...

435
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:36,677
come in here.

436
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,588
There's no one in here.

437
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,059
It's just you and me.

438
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

439
00:34:14,014 --> 00:34:16,548
Okay.

440
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,683
I think we...

441
00:34:18,685 --> 00:34:20,053
got off on the wrong foot.

442
00:34:21,154 --> 00:34:23,154
You're new.

443
00:34:23,156 --> 00:34:25,092
I accept your apology.

444
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:54,786
It's interesting.

445
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,721
Yeah, she's just...

446
00:34:56,723 --> 00:34:58,056
Well, there's two of them.

447
00:34:58,058 --> 00:35:00,725
Oh. I thought
it was just the little girl.

448
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:04,195
So did I, but the brother
is back from boarding school,

449
00:35:04,197 --> 00:35:06,197
and I think he hates me.

450
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:08,066
I knew it sounded

451
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:09,868
too good to be true.

452
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,736
Still happy you went?

453
00:35:11,738 --> 00:35:13,038
Oh, yeah.

454
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,206
Sorry. It's great.

455
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,875
So focus on the positives.

456
00:35:16,877 --> 00:35:18,777
Don't let this kid
get under your skin.

457
00:35:18,779 --> 00:35:21,046
Working on it.

458
00:35:21,048 --> 00:35:22,814
Tell me about the house now.

459
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:24,849
Are there, like,
creepy suits of armor

460
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:26,718
or paintings with eyes cut out?

461
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
Or a crypt in the basement?

462
00:35:31,091 --> 00:35:33,091
Yeah.

463
00:35:33,093 --> 00:35:35,093
Hello?

464
00:35:35,095 --> 00:35:37,162
Kate?

465
00:35:37,164 --> 00:35:39,130
You're not listening to me.

466
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:40,832
No, I am listening.

467
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:42,233
Help!

468
00:35:42,235 --> 00:35:44,836
So, remember that guy Tanner?

469
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:46,971
We went to that bar
on 14th a few weeks ago.

470
00:35:46,973 --> 00:35:48,706
Well, he finally
called me back,

471
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:51,178
but, but now I don't even think
it's worth it, so, um...

472
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,949
Oh, my God.
I got to go.

473
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

474
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,988
No!

475
00:37:00,947 --> 00:37:02,213
We got you. We got you.

476
00:37:02,215 --> 00:37:04,749
We got you. We got you.

477
00:37:04,751 --> 00:37:06,184
What?

478
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:18,098
Both of you in the house now!

479
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:36,181
What on earth happened to you?

480
00:37:36,183 --> 00:37:38,917
Ask the thoroughbreds.

481
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

482
00:39:22,055 --> 00:39:23,455
What?

483
00:39:23,457 --> 00:39:26,124
What are you doing?

484
00:39:26,126 --> 00:39:28,329
There was a spider on you.

485
00:39:35,336 --> 00:39:37,871
It was crawling up
towards your face.

486
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:44,909
When my door is closed,
I'd like you to knock.

487
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:47,011
Your light was on.

488
00:39:47,013 --> 00:39:49,914
I thought you'd be awake.

489
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:51,217
You're scared of the dark?

490
00:40:02,162 --> 00:40:03,331
I'm sorry.

491
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:09,002
I haven't made
the best impression, have I?

492
00:40:10,937 --> 00:40:12,872
To be honest, you haven't.

493
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:18,142
Miles.

494
00:40:18,144 --> 00:40:20,512
What happened at school?

495
00:40:20,514 --> 00:40:24,117
Why did you hurt that boy?

496
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:30,088
He burned... every one

497
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,926
of the pictures
my father sent me.

498
00:40:35,095 --> 00:40:37,997
I miss him.

499
00:40:47,508 --> 00:40:49,443
You need to go to bed.

500
00:41:04,157 --> 00:41:07,026
Can I still give you
your riding lesson tomorrow?

501
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:10,930
Sure.

502
00:41:55,308 --> 00:41:57,074
Head up.
Thighs against the horse.

503
00:41:57,076 --> 00:41:59,177
Sit in the center
of the saddle.

504
00:41:59,179 --> 00:42:00,379
You'll get better balance.

505
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:04,583
Ride harder. Put your thumb
on the top of your reins,

506
00:42:04,585 --> 00:42:06,552
and your pinkie on the bottom.

507
00:42:06,554 --> 00:42:08,353
- Don't let her get the bit.
- Okay, I'm not.

508
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:13,090
Rein her in hard.

509
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,365
Well done.

510
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:22,099
You didn't have
to keep whipping her.

511
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:24,268
Yes, I did.

512
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,438
You wanted to learn.
That's how Quint taught me.

513
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,340
It's a strong animal.

514
00:42:28,342 --> 00:42:29,641
If you don't exert
power over it,

515
00:42:29,643 --> 00:42:32,377
then you'll never gain control.

516
00:42:35,315 --> 00:42:37,048
You look good up there.

517
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,050
Miles.

518
00:42:39,052 --> 00:42:41,520
I'm bored.
Can we do something else now?

519
00:42:41,522 --> 00:42:43,154
What do you want to do?

520
00:42:43,156 --> 00:42:45,256
Can we show Kate the koi pond?

521
00:42:45,258 --> 00:42:47,426
It's Flora's favorite part
of the garden.

522
00:42:47,428 --> 00:42:48,529
Let's check it out.

523
00:43:16,457 --> 00:43:18,189
Look.

524
00:43:18,191 --> 00:43:21,158
That koi is, like,
bumping into the wall.

525
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,861
Like, ga-dah.

526
00:43:25,298 --> 00:43:26,565
Okay.

527
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:28,199
She's trying to make
her great escape.

528
00:43:28,201 --> 00:43:29,468
Maybe she wants to be
a flying fish.

529
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:31,037
Make a wish upon the rock.

530
00:43:32,606 --> 00:43:34,439
I wish this...

531
00:43:35,643 --> 00:43:37,543
25 years.

532
00:43:37,545 --> 00:43:39,110
What if you lived

533
00:43:39,112 --> 00:43:41,178
to be, like, a hundred?

534
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,314
♪ Ah! ♪

535
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,385
This is so pretty.

536
00:43:46,387 --> 00:43:48,319
- Miles!
- He's got a fish!

537
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:49,555
Stop!

538
00:43:49,557 --> 00:43:51,222
Get the hell off of her!

539
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,062
- Aw, poor baby.
- Aw.

540
00:43:58,465 --> 00:44:00,066
Miles.

541
00:44:02,403 --> 00:44:04,505
What are you doing?

542
00:44:10,411 --> 00:44:11,645
Nothing should have to suffer.

543
00:44:13,714 --> 00:44:16,182
That was my favorite fish.

544
00:44:17,317 --> 00:44:19,553
Now you've seen the koi pond.

545
00:44:37,504 --> 00:44:40,271
Ah, I love this tea party.

546
00:44:40,273 --> 00:44:41,540
Me, too.

547
00:44:41,542 --> 00:44:44,610
Hey, don't drink out of my cup.

548
00:44:44,612 --> 00:44:47,514
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't
give you any tea.

549
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,512
Oh, my...

550
00:45:21,214 --> 00:45:23,182
Miles.

551
00:46:00,788 --> 00:46:03,322
Flora.

552
00:46:05,392 --> 00:46:08,328
Just checking
you were still here.

553
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:15,500
Still here.

554
00:46:23,477 --> 00:46:27,045
Miles' effects from his school
arrived this morning.

555
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:29,315
Oh.

556
00:46:35,756 --> 00:46:37,756
- Mrs. Grose.
- What?

557
00:46:37,758 --> 00:46:39,391
Do you ever hear...?

558
00:46:41,294 --> 00:46:42,394
I'm gonna get you.

559
00:46:42,396 --> 00:46:43,495
I'm gonna get you.
You're it!

560
00:46:43,497 --> 00:46:44,796
Guys, it's very early.

561
00:46:44,798 --> 00:46:47,065
- Can you stop? You guys.
- Children,

562
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:48,633
can you listen to Kate?

563
00:46:48,635 --> 00:46:50,569
Listen to Kate, please.

564
00:46:52,473 --> 00:46:53,774
You need to take charge here,
Kate.

565
00:46:59,346 --> 00:47:01,247
Bad dreams?

566
00:47:11,324 --> 00:47:12,524
I have an idea.

567
00:47:12,526 --> 00:47:15,093
Since it's Saturday,
why don't we go

568
00:47:15,095 --> 00:47:17,462
into Millbrook
and get a new koi?

569
00:47:17,464 --> 00:47:18,732
Hmm?

570
00:47:19,867 --> 00:47:22,100
Yeah.

571
00:47:24,104 --> 00:47:25,604
I don't want to.

572
00:47:25,606 --> 00:47:26,671
Come on, it'll be fun.

573
00:47:26,673 --> 00:47:29,476
You know that Flora
doesn't leave the property.

574
00:47:30,744 --> 00:47:32,780
You don't have to go, darling.

575
00:47:39,419 --> 00:47:41,520
What if I asked
my special friend, huh?

576
00:47:41,522 --> 00:47:43,490
Want me to try?

577
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:47,761
Will you keep me
and Flora safe?

578
00:47:50,631 --> 00:47:52,397
You will?

579
00:47:52,399 --> 00:47:54,568
- And Kate, too?
- And Kate, too?

580
00:47:55,636 --> 00:47:58,770
Really?

581
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:01,675
He says you have nothing
to worry about.

582
00:48:05,412 --> 00:48:07,648
Okay.
So, go get your coat.

583
00:48:11,785 --> 00:48:13,685
Good job, Miles.

584
00:48:13,687 --> 00:48:15,622
He also thinks
your tattoo is sexy.

585
00:49:08,642 --> 00:49:10,909
Please stop.
I don't want to go.

586
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,644
Oh, no, honey.
We're almost at the gate.

587
00:49:12,646 --> 00:49:14,479
We'll be fine.

588
00:49:14,481 --> 00:49:16,615
I don't want to go. Stop!

589
00:49:16,617 --> 00:49:17,916
Hey. What are you doing?

590
00:49:17,918 --> 00:49:19,517
- I want to get out.
- Flora.

591
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:20,785
- Stay in your seat.
- Stop the car.

592
00:49:20,787 --> 00:49:22,520
No, leave your seat belt on.

593
00:49:22,522 --> 00:49:25,056
- Sit down, Flora.
- Miles, tell her

594
00:49:25,058 --> 00:49:27,559
to stop or I'm gonna die.

595
00:49:27,561 --> 00:49:30,662
- Stop the car.
- Miles, I don't want to die.

596
00:49:30,664 --> 00:49:32,532
Stop the car
or I'll fucking kill you!

597
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:39,938
I told you to stop.

598
00:49:41,942 --> 00:49:43,942
Hey. Flora.

599
00:49:43,944 --> 00:49:45,812
Oh, Jesus.

600
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:49,683
Oh, come on.

601
00:49:52,953 --> 00:49:55,854
I know what you're afraid of.

602
00:49:55,856 --> 00:49:58,025
Keeping the lights on
won't keep you safe.

603
00:50:19,846 --> 00:50:22,482
Flora?

604
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:24,549
Flora?

605
00:50:24,551 --> 00:50:25,852
Leave her alone.

606
00:50:29,022 --> 00:50:30,588
Flora, can you look at me?

607
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,756
She doesn't want
to talk to you.

608
00:50:31,758 --> 00:50:33,792
You terrified her.

609
00:50:33,794 --> 00:50:36,861
Where'd they find you, anyways?

610
00:50:36,863 --> 00:50:39,898
You know, you need to stop
talking to me like that.

611
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,600
You're not our mother,
you're not our family.

612
00:50:42,602 --> 00:50:44,069
Stop pretending to be.

613
00:50:44,071 --> 00:50:46,638
I...

614
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,740
I'm leaving.

615
00:50:48,742 --> 00:50:49,908
Yeah.

616
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:52,579
Just leave.
Leave like everyone else.

617
00:51:34,654 --> 00:51:37,922
This is Rose's assistant.
How may I help you?

618
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,659
Hi, Rose.

619
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:42,894
Hey, Kate.

620
00:51:42,896 --> 00:51:44,796
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

621
00:51:44,798 --> 00:51:48,166
I'm great.
Um, how are you?

622
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:50,802
It's so nice
to hear your voice.

623
00:51:50,804 --> 00:51:53,872
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

624
00:51:53,874 --> 00:51:55,807
Actually, it's, um,

625
00:51:55,809 --> 00:51:57,776
it's a little tough here.

626
00:51:57,778 --> 00:52:02,680
The... the boy hates my guts
for some reason,

627
00:52:02,682 --> 00:52:06,818
and the little girl
isn't speaking to me, so...

628
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,821
I'd like to think

629
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:14,393
it's nothing that I'm doing,
but... maybe it is.

630
00:52:14,395 --> 00:52:18,029
Or maybe they just
don't want me.

631
00:52:18,031 --> 00:52:20,698
I don't know.

632
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,635
I don't know.

633
00:52:23,637 --> 00:52:25,737
It's really, um, hard here.

634
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:28,006
I think, uh...

635
00:52:28,008 --> 00:52:30,975
I think maybe I can't stay.

636
00:52:30,977 --> 00:52:32,744
Then don't. Bail.

637
00:52:32,746 --> 00:52:34,646
They can find someone else
and I can have

638
00:52:34,648 --> 00:52:36,948
my roommate back.

639
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,158
No.

640
00:52:47,794 --> 00:52:49,060
I can't.

641
00:52:49,062 --> 00:52:51,896
I made Flora a promise.

642
00:52:51,898 --> 00:52:54,901
And I crossed my heart
and hoped to die.

643
00:53:14,955 --> 00:53:15,956
Hi.

644
00:53:24,164 --> 00:53:25,198
Can I sit?

645
00:53:35,909 --> 00:53:38,879
That's better.

646
00:53:41,848 --> 00:53:43,715
Hey, Flora.

647
00:53:43,717 --> 00:53:47,053
I'm sorry that I didn't stop
when you first asked me.

648
00:53:48,755 --> 00:53:51,224
It's really not nice
not to be listened to.

649
00:53:55,962 --> 00:53:58,129
Have you ever heard
of a brave face?

650
00:53:58,131 --> 00:54:00,131
Hmm?

651
00:54:00,133 --> 00:54:01,733
I'm actually wearing mine
right now.

652
00:54:01,735 --> 00:54:02,903
Can you see it?

653
00:54:05,939 --> 00:54:07,906
I don't see anything.

654
00:54:07,908 --> 00:54:09,040
That's good.

655
00:54:09,042 --> 00:54:10,141
Because it's invisible.

656
00:54:10,143 --> 00:54:12,110
So if you saw something,
it would mean it was broken.

657
00:54:12,112 --> 00:54:14,145
My mom showed me
how to make one,

658
00:54:14,147 --> 00:54:15,280
so I can do it for you
if you want.

659
00:54:15,282 --> 00:54:16,814
I've actually been wearing mine

660
00:54:16,816 --> 00:54:19,017
since I was way younger
than you.

661
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:21,353
- Really?
- Yeah.

662
00:54:21,355 --> 00:54:22,822
What do you think?
Should we try?

663
00:54:24,257 --> 00:54:26,824
I just have to...

664
00:54:26,826 --> 00:54:29,361
do a quick scan of your face
to make it first, okay?

665
00:54:29,363 --> 00:54:31,129
Blow.

666
00:54:31,131 --> 00:54:32,964
Good, good, good.

667
00:54:35,802 --> 00:54:37,235
Oh, that's a good one.

668
00:54:37,237 --> 00:54:38,537
- Yeah.
- That's really... you got

669
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:40,104
- a good face for it, yeah.
- Yeah.

670
00:54:40,106 --> 00:54:41,940
So I'm gonna get all of
my bravery and all of yours

671
00:54:41,942 --> 00:54:43,208
and mix it together...

672
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:46,112
and get it into
my fingertips. Okay.

673
00:54:51,552 --> 00:54:53,218
Looks good.

674
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,919
So let's see.

675
00:54:54,921 --> 00:54:56,321
Show me your brave face.

676
00:54:57,991 --> 00:55:00,091
Flora, come on.

677
00:55:00,093 --> 00:55:02,193
You've got a,

678
00:55:02,195 --> 00:55:04,829
a wild animal inside you...
let me see you roar.

679
00:55:04,831 --> 00:55:06,565
Roar!

680
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:09,100
Ha!

681
00:55:09,102 --> 00:55:11,102
That was a huge roar.

682
00:55:11,104 --> 00:55:13,004
I've never seen a brave face
take so fast.

683
00:55:13,006 --> 00:55:14,406
Should we test it out?
Should we see

684
00:55:14,408 --> 00:55:16,575
- if we can see ourselves in the water?
- Yeah.

685
00:55:16,577 --> 00:55:19,110
Roar!

686
00:55:36,162 --> 00:55:37,929
Hi.

687
00:55:42,436 --> 00:55:45,136
Um, I-I got you something
in town.

688
00:55:52,446 --> 00:55:54,382
It's, um...

689
00:55:56,082 --> 00:55:59,152
This... it's just
this great album.

690
00:56:00,186 --> 00:56:01,355
Thanks.

691
00:56:05,225 --> 00:56:07,992
So, I know how close

692
00:56:07,994 --> 00:56:11,365
you and Quint were.

693
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:16,200
Yeah. He was my friend.

694
00:56:16,202 --> 00:56:18,038
Yeah.

695
00:56:20,307 --> 00:56:22,940
That must've been really tough.

696
00:56:28,315 --> 00:56:30,317
Do you want to talk about it?

697
00:56:32,085 --> 00:56:33,853
Not really.

698
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,157
Well, you know,
something kind of similar

699
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:40,958
happened to me
when I was your age,

700
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,960
and I'd wished I had someone

701
00:56:42,962 --> 00:56:43,997
to talk to.

702
00:56:45,965 --> 00:56:47,932
Okay.

703
00:56:47,934 --> 00:56:50,236
Look, I'm not trying to replace Quint.

704
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:56,240
Can you stop?

705
00:56:56,242 --> 00:56:58,209
Miles.

706
00:56:58,211 --> 00:56:59,312
Can you please stop?

707
00:57:28,007 --> 00:57:29,375
We need to talk.

708
00:57:29,377 --> 00:57:32,009
Oh, you're back.

709
00:57:32,011 --> 00:57:33,913
I thought
we'd lost another one.

710
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:37,416
Is Miles the reason
Miss Jessel left?

711
00:57:37,418 --> 00:57:39,418
Miles?

712
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,420
Don't be ridiculous.

713
00:57:41,422 --> 00:57:43,323
Then why?

714
00:57:44,425 --> 00:57:46,157
It was Quint.

715
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:48,362
There was something going on
between them.

716
00:57:50,029 --> 00:57:52,263
Could tell
by the way he looked at her.

717
00:57:52,265 --> 00:57:55,233
That's not a reason
to run away.

718
00:57:55,235 --> 00:57:57,403
Well, I gather
things went south with them.

719
00:57:57,405 --> 00:57:58,437
Why?

720
00:57:58,439 --> 00:58:00,204
Because he was a brute.

721
00:58:00,206 --> 00:58:02,140
When the parents died,

722
00:58:02,142 --> 00:58:04,275
he walked around this place
like he owned it.

723
00:58:04,277 --> 00:58:07,346
Even moved himself
into the master suite.

724
00:58:07,348 --> 00:58:09,383
He was disgusting.

725
00:58:11,317 --> 00:58:13,253
How did Quint die?

726
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,188
He had an accident

727
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:19,758
couple of weeks
after Miss Jessel left.

728
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,126
Fell from his horse,

729
00:58:22,128 --> 00:58:23,395
drunk.

730
00:58:23,397 --> 00:58:27,334
Died in the dirt
like the animal that he was.

731
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,370
How was he with Miles?

732
00:58:31,372 --> 00:58:35,106
Well, he was
a terrible influence.

733
00:58:35,108 --> 00:58:37,008
He used to take Miles

734
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:40,011
and disappear with him
for hours.

735
00:58:40,013 --> 00:58:43,549
Miles was such a sweet boy.

736
00:58:43,551 --> 00:58:47,555
The Miles I've met
is not a sweet boy.

737
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:53,259
Well, that is really no concern
of yours, is it, Kate?

738
00:58:54,361 --> 00:58:56,495
Then whose concern is it?

739
00:58:56,497 --> 00:58:59,433
I mean, it certainly doesn't
seem to be any of yours.

740
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

741
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,400
<i>Quint sat next to me at dinner,</i>

742
01:00:41,402 --> 01:00:43,468
<i>reeking of whiskey.</i>

743
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:45,470
<i>He won't leave me alone.</i>

744
01:00:45,472 --> 01:00:48,375
<i>Mrs. Grose
won't do anything to help.</i>

745
01:00:50,477 --> 01:00:52,744
<i>I have to sleep
with my door locked.</i>

746
01:00:52,746 --> 01:00:56,715
<i>Quint tried to come in
in the middle of the night.</i>

747
01:00:56,717 --> 01:01:00,151
<i>I can barely focus
on my lessons now.</i>

748
01:01:00,153 --> 01:01:03,655
<i>I feel Quint's eyes on me
all the time.</i>

749
01:01:03,657 --> 01:01:07,158
<i>I woke up to a photo
that Quint left on my bed.</i>

750
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,661
<i>I don't know how he got in.</i>

751
01:01:09,663 --> 01:01:12,229
<i>I'm not safe.</i>

752
01:01:12,231 --> 01:01:14,368
<i>I have to leave.</i>

753
01:01:45,966 --> 01:01:47,735
Miles, come back!

754
01:01:54,642 --> 01:01:57,442
Miles!
Talk to me!

755
01:02:01,715 --> 01:02:02,683
Miles!

756
01:02:11,725 --> 01:02:13,192
Wait!

757
01:02:46,727 --> 01:02:48,696
<i>Stop.</i>

758
01:02:52,366 --> 01:02:54,766
<i>You're hurting me.</i>

759
01:03:05,713 --> 01:03:07,612
Help me.

760
01:03:07,614 --> 01:03:11,383
Help me. Help me.

761
01:03:11,385 --> 01:03:14,352
Help me.

762
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:53,391
Flora.

763
01:03:53,393 --> 01:03:55,560
Can you paint at your desk,
please?

764
01:03:55,562 --> 01:03:57,395
I paint better over here.

765
01:03:57,397 --> 01:03:59,531
No, you're gonna get paint
all over the floor.

766
01:03:59,533 --> 01:04:02,667
Okay, fine.
I'm finished anyways.

767
01:04:02,669 --> 01:04:04,669
Want to see?

768
01:04:04,671 --> 01:04:06,406
Sure.

769
01:04:12,379 --> 01:04:14,412
What is this?

770
01:04:14,414 --> 01:04:16,517
Me and Miss Jessel.

771
01:04:26,827 --> 01:04:29,863
Can we play flashlight tag now?

772
01:04:32,533 --> 01:04:33,832
No.

773
01:04:33,834 --> 01:04:36,635
But you promised.

774
01:04:36,637 --> 01:04:38,937
Yeah, Kate, you promised.

775
01:04:38,939 --> 01:04:42,741
You don't want
to let Flora down, do you?

776
01:04:42,743 --> 01:04:44,709
You promised.

777
01:04:44,711 --> 01:04:46,411
You promised. You promised.

778
01:04:46,413 --> 01:04:48,847
You promised.
You promised. You promised.

779
01:04:48,849 --> 01:04:50,715
- You promised. You promised. You promised.
- Okay.

780
01:04:50,717 --> 01:04:52,717
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- You promised.

781
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:54,354
Just...

782
01:04:57,491 --> 01:04:59,958
- What are the rules?
- Turn off all the lights.

783
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,693
You have to find us with this.

784
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,795
If you flash us,

785
01:05:03,797 --> 01:05:04,996
we're dead.

786
01:05:04,998 --> 01:05:06,498
You're it.

787
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,500
Call out the state capitals.

788
01:05:08,502 --> 01:05:09,868
No peeking.

789
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:11,839
Come on, come on, come on!

790
01:05:14,575 --> 01:05:16,775
Alaska.

791
01:05:16,777 --> 01:05:19,010
Juneau.

792
01:05:19,012 --> 01:05:21,680
Arizona.

793
01:05:21,682 --> 01:05:23,617
Phoenix.

794
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:51,269
Gotcha.

795
01:06:51,271 --> 01:06:52,570
I'm dead!

796
01:06:52,572 --> 01:06:55,006
I'm dead. Oh! I'm dead.

797
01:06:55,008 --> 01:06:56,975
Ah!

798
01:06:58,979 --> 01:07:01,982
Is Miles down there?

799
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:05,517
Maybe.

800
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:06,952
You want to come with me
to find him?

801
01:07:06,954 --> 01:07:09,654
I can't. I'm dead.

802
01:08:02,809 --> 01:08:03,977
Miles!

803
01:08:07,047 --> 01:08:09,649
Okay, I don't want
to play anymore.

804
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

805
01:09:20,821 --> 01:09:22,253
Miles?

806
01:09:22,255 --> 01:09:24,823
Hmm. Can you make the moves?

807
01:09:24,825 --> 01:09:26,057
- No.
- No.

808
01:09:26,059 --> 01:09:27,792
Can I even play?

809
01:09:49,116 --> 01:09:52,152
Can you just... just stop!

810
01:10:03,096 --> 01:10:04,762
Stop it!

811
01:10:04,764 --> 01:10:06,064
This isn't funny!

812
01:10:06,066 --> 01:10:08,933
You...

813
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

814
01:10:39,866 --> 01:10:42,033
- You!
- Kate.

815
01:10:42,035 --> 01:10:44,804
Oh, my God.
What happened to your face?

816
01:10:51,878 --> 01:10:53,945
Explain yourself.

817
01:10:53,947 --> 01:10:56,814
I was hungry?

818
01:10:56,816 --> 01:10:59,050
I am sick of the games!

819
01:10:59,052 --> 01:11:00,985
Don't talk to them like that.

820
01:11:00,987 --> 01:11:03,054
He has been terrorizing me

821
01:11:03,056 --> 01:11:04,889
since day one!

822
01:11:04,891 --> 01:11:06,224
Don't be ridiculous.

823
01:11:06,226 --> 01:11:09,328
He's been here with me
for the last 15 minutes.

824
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:11,196
The only person
doing the terrorizing

825
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:12,299
round here is you.

826
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:19,739
Now what are you doing?

827
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:51,264
Yeah.

828
01:14:38,506 --> 01:14:40,408
Bad dreams?

829
01:14:43,243 --> 01:14:45,411
I'm gonna sleep with you, okay?

830
01:14:50,518 --> 01:14:53,017
Come on.

831
01:15:40,066 --> 01:15:42,101
This came for you.

832
01:15:52,145 --> 01:15:53,514
Did you open my mail?

833
01:15:54,615 --> 01:15:57,384
It came like that.

834
01:15:59,285 --> 01:16:01,589
Who is Darla?

835
01:16:03,056 --> 01:16:04,523
My mother.

836
01:16:04,525 --> 01:16:06,125
Oh, I see.

837
01:16:08,094 --> 01:16:10,464
Well, we can't choose
our family.

838
01:16:31,385 --> 01:16:35,021
Whatever your mother has,
let's hope it's not genetic.

839
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:12,457
Yeah?

840
01:17:12,459 --> 01:17:14,326
Kate...

841
01:17:14,328 --> 01:17:16,227
I need you.

842
01:17:16,229 --> 01:17:18,363
Mom?

843
01:17:18,365 --> 01:17:20,332
Oh.

844
01:17:20,334 --> 01:17:22,901
Uh, I can't talk right now.

845
01:17:22,903 --> 01:17:25,437
They're gonna throw me out.

846
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:26,738
What?

847
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:28,340
Uh, Mom.

848
01:17:29,643 --> 01:17:32,377
I think I'm seeing things.

849
01:17:32,379 --> 01:17:34,615
Did you look at the drawings?

850
01:17:36,215 --> 01:17:37,451
Yeah.

851
01:17:40,554 --> 01:17:42,690
- Darla.
- Mom?

852
01:17:44,257 --> 01:17:45,492
Mom!

853
01:19:05,271 --> 01:19:06,373
Kate.

854
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

855
01:20:09,636 --> 01:20:10,804
Flora?

856
01:20:11,872 --> 01:20:13,574
Flora?

857
01:20:15,709 --> 01:20:17,344
Miles?

858
01:20:22,649 --> 01:20:24,483
You're gonna wake the children.

859
01:20:24,485 --> 01:20:25,851
The children are asleep.

860
01:20:25,853 --> 01:20:28,520
I said you need to leave now.

861
01:20:28,522 --> 01:20:30,691
Let me go, let me go.

862
01:20:31,792 --> 01:20:32,924
No, stop.

863
01:21:10,464 --> 01:21:12,564
Stop. No. No!

864
01:21:12,566 --> 01:21:15,634
Yes.

865
01:21:15,636 --> 01:21:17,536
Yes.

866
01:21:54,942 --> 01:21:55,974
Oh, my God.

867
01:21:58,478 --> 01:22:01,548
Kate. Kate.

868
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:04,751
Kate.

869
01:22:06,787 --> 01:22:08,486
It was him.

870
01:22:08,488 --> 01:22:09,855
It was Quint!

871
01:22:09,857 --> 01:22:12,424
What are you talking about?

872
01:22:12,426 --> 01:22:14,426
Quint murdered Jessel.

873
01:22:14,428 --> 01:22:15,894
I saw her body
in the bottom of the lake.

874
01:22:15,896 --> 01:22:17,796
You stop now.

875
01:22:17,798 --> 01:22:19,867
You stop telling tales.

876
01:22:21,902 --> 01:22:23,871
You knew.

877
01:22:28,442 --> 01:22:30,942
You knew Quint killed Jessel.

878
01:22:30,944 --> 01:22:32,010
Look.

879
01:22:32,012 --> 01:22:33,645
Quint's dead.

880
01:22:33,647 --> 01:22:35,582
I made sure of it.

881
01:22:39,519 --> 01:22:40,552
Where are the kids?

882
01:22:40,554 --> 01:22:41,786
You stay away from them.

883
01:22:41,788 --> 01:22:44,789
They're not safe!

884
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:47,525
I should never have let you
in here in the first place.

885
01:22:47,527 --> 01:22:48,693
You knew.

886
01:22:48,695 --> 01:22:50,595
You knew.
You never did anything.

887
01:22:50,597 --> 01:22:53,698
I've been protecting
this family for a lifetime,

888
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,934
and I won't let you near them.

889
01:22:55,936 --> 01:22:57,903
'Cause you're mad, Kate.

890
01:22:57,905 --> 01:22:59,539
Move!

891
01:23:25,599 --> 01:23:26,831
Flora!

892
01:23:26,833 --> 01:23:29,501
Oh, Flora. Oh...

893
01:23:29,503 --> 01:23:30,802
Are you okay?

894
01:23:30,804 --> 01:23:31,903
I'm scared.

895
01:23:31,905 --> 01:23:35,573
Okay, do you still have
that brave face?

896
01:23:35,575 --> 01:23:38,011
I need you to put it on, okay?

897
01:23:41,748 --> 01:23:42,747
It's good?

898
01:23:42,749 --> 01:23:44,749
Okay, let's go.

899
01:23:44,751 --> 01:23:46,584
Where are we going?

900
01:23:48,855 --> 01:23:50,622
Everything's gonna be fine.

901
01:23:50,624 --> 01:23:51,823
We just need to get to the car.

902
01:23:51,825 --> 01:23:53,024
I don't want to die!

903
01:23:53,026 --> 01:23:54,826
I don't want to leave!

904
01:23:54,828 --> 01:23:55,961
Flora, come back.

905
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:04,569
Miles?

906
01:24:04,571 --> 01:24:05,637
We have to go.

907
01:24:05,639 --> 01:24:06,771
We have to get Flora
out of here.

908
01:24:15,649 --> 01:24:18,149
Hey, Miles, listen.

909
01:24:18,151 --> 01:24:19,818
It's Quint.

910
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:22,320
I thought I was going crazy,
but I'm not.

911
01:24:22,322 --> 01:24:23,490
He's here.

912
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:27,961
Oh.

913
01:24:30,063 --> 01:24:32,499
You know that, don't you?

914
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:36,167
Mrs. Grose is dead, isn't she?

915
01:24:39,906 --> 01:24:42,807
Yeah.

916
01:24:42,809 --> 01:24:45,344
We need to leave.

917
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:47,078
No.

918
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,881
I can't.

919
01:24:49,883 --> 01:24:51,916
I'm sorry.

920
01:24:51,918 --> 01:24:53,618
For everything.

921
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:56,788
Flora won't leave without you.
We need to go.

922
01:25:00,594 --> 01:25:01,726
I can't.

923
01:25:01,728 --> 01:25:03,161
He won't let me leave.

924
01:25:11,204 --> 01:25:13,204
How long until he hurts Flora?

925
01:25:17,677 --> 01:25:19,811
Please, Miles.

926
01:25:19,813 --> 01:25:21,948
Miles.

927
01:25:25,118 --> 01:25:26,117
Please.

928
01:25:37,731 --> 01:25:39,566
Open the door!

929
01:25:42,202 --> 01:25:45,003
Okay. Okay.

930
01:25:45,005 --> 01:25:46,738
Okay, stay down.

931
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:47,774
I need you to be brave, okay?

932
01:25:49,676 --> 01:25:50,911
Okay.

933
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:12,831
Come on.
Come on, open.

934
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

935
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:28,913
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Come on!

936
01:26:28,915 --> 01:26:29,950
Okay.

937
01:26:52,739 --> 01:26:54,239
Whatever your mother has,

938
01:26:54,241 --> 01:26:56,843
let's hope it's not genetic.

939
01:26:59,112 --> 01:27:02,182
I guess you can't escape
the inevitable.

940
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:21,966
No, stop it. I'm serious.

941
01:27:21,968 --> 01:27:23,801
You shouldn't be going
into her room.

942
01:27:23,803 --> 01:27:25,236
You have to trust me on this.

943
01:27:25,238 --> 01:27:27,739
Shh. I can hear her.

944
01:27:27,741 --> 01:27:28,942
Play it cool.
She's coming.

945
01:27:31,011 --> 01:27:32,844
Miles, what's wrong with her?

946
01:27:32,846 --> 01:27:35,081
She looks scary.

947
01:27:40,954 --> 01:27:42,956
What are you guys
doing in here?

948
01:27:44,991 --> 01:27:46,758
I want to go.

949
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,259
What's wrong?

950
01:27:48,261 --> 01:27:50,061
Shh.

951
01:27:50,063 --> 01:27:51,064
Flora.

952
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:03,007
Flora.

953
01:28:03,009 --> 01:28:04,711
Flora?

954
01:28:07,814 --> 01:28:09,348
Did you see Quint
in the mirror?

955
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:10,882
I know that you saw him.

956
01:28:10,884 --> 01:28:12,850
Yes, you did.
I saw you.

957
01:28:12,852 --> 01:28:14,854
Quint's dead.

958
01:28:16,189 --> 01:28:17,855
You saw him, too.

959
01:28:17,857 --> 01:28:19,958
No, I didn't.

960
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:20,992
Why are you lying to me?

961
01:28:20,994 --> 01:28:22,293
I saw him.
I know you saw him.

962
01:28:22,295 --> 01:28:23,562
I didn't see him!

963
01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:25,230
Just tell me that you saw him!

964
01:28:25,232 --> 01:28:27,799
Flora, tell me you saw...

965
01:28:27,801 --> 01:28:31,202
You broke her!

966
01:28:31,204 --> 01:28:33,304
- She's broken. You broke her!
- I can,

967
01:28:33,306 --> 01:28:35,039
I can fix her.
Just let me...

968
01:28:35,041 --> 01:28:36,975
No, you can't!
You broke her!

969
01:28:36,977 --> 01:28:38,142
- Flora, it was an accident.
- You broke her!

970
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:40,278
You can't fix it.

971
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,013
She's broken.

972
01:28:42,015 --> 01:28:44,751
Just like you.

973
01:28:49,856 --> 01:28:51,124
Come on, Flora.

974
01:29:06,172 --> 01:29:08,340
Why is Kate crazy?

975
01:29:08,342 --> 01:29:11,909
I don't know.

976
01:29:11,911 --> 01:29:13,011
<i>Well,
that's a big responsibility.</i>

977
01:29:13,013 --> 01:29:15,179
<i>Miss Jessel left
without saying goodbye.</i>

978
01:29:15,181 --> 01:29:17,115
- <i>It was Quint.</i>
- <i>I know what you're afraid of.</i>

979
01:29:17,117 --> 01:29:18,450
<i>You need to
take charge here, Kate.</i>

980
01:29:18,452 --> 01:29:19,652
<i>Just checking
you were still here.</i>

981
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:21,019
<i>You're not our mother,
you're not our family.</i>

982
01:29:21,021 --> 01:29:22,153
- <i>Stop pretending to be.</i>
- <i>He's been terrorizing me</i>

983
01:29:22,155 --> 01:29:24,456
- <i>since day one.</i>
- <i>The only person</i>

984
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:26,926
<i>doing the terroizing
round here is you.</i>

985
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:08,231
