00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:43,434
Now, if I mention something,

3
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:45,654
do you promise
to be civil about it?

4
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:47,264
When you say things like that,

5
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:48,918
I notice I grip
the handle of the pan

6
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,485
just a little tighter.

7
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:52,269
It's not that
I don't appreciate

8
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:55,316
everything that you do for me,
and the family too.

9
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:58,493
Out with it.

10
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,409
The hem is a bit short
on one side.

11
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:02,932
You're blind.

12
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:04,542
Are you keeping an eye
on the time?

13
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,761
I'm paying attention.

14
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:09,460
But look. Look here.

15
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:10,896
They were the same
when I did them.

16
00:01:10,983 --> 00:01:12,463
Yeah, but that's all
well and good,

17
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,204
but I'll be at the office

18
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,685
and I'll be looking like
I'm some kind of rapper guy.

19
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:19,340
I highly doubt that
anybody is ever going to

20
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:22,647
mistake you for a rapper guy.

21
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:26,869
What time is it?

22
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:29,741
Henry, she's there.
Come on, Henry.

23
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:31,091
She's early.

24
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,853
Be careful. Watch your steps.

25
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,726
Shh. Quiet.

26
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:01,033
Watch the baby.

27
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,948
I can't. I can't get...

28
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:04,341
Get her off of me.

29
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:10,869
Got it. Come on!

30
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:16,092
No, no, no!

31
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,050
Shh. Keep quiet.

32
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,141
Shh.

33
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,974
Shh. Shh.

34
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:05,881
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

35
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:17,632
"Aloha" means "hello"
and "goodbye."

36
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,808
She's up.

37
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:22,027
Hmm?

38
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:25,857
Oh.

39
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:28,120
Hello. My name is Audrey.

40
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,819
And this is my husband...

41
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:32,690
Oh. Well, he'll be along.

42
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:35,432
The stairs just take
a few extra seconds.

43
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,478
Mmm, mmm!

44
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:39,697
There.

45
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:44,659
Uh, as I was saying,
my name is Audrey,

46
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:45,747
and this is my husband Henry.

47
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:50,012
First and foremost, Shannon,
we would like to apologize

48
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,842
for scaring you this morning,
but after much deliberation,

49
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:55,757
we feel this would be
the best way

50
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:59,021
for you to go missing.

51
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:03,678
By now, you've recognized
my husband Henry,

52
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:06,115
or Dr. Walsh
as you would better know him.

53
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:08,073
Hello, Miss Shannon.

54
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,598
Dr. Walsh will continue
your care from our home.

55
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:13,644
You should know

56
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:15,080
that we mean you

57
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:18,780
or your unborn child no harm.

58
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,912
While we apologize
for what we must do,

59
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:22,827
please make no mistake.

60
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:24,960
We must do it,
and we will not waver

61
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:29,181
no matter how much you beg.
So, please do not try,

62
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,750
as we all have feelings.

63
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:34,883
Do you understand?

64
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,493
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

65
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,190
Do you know
that we don't want to hurt you

66
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,235
or your baby?

67
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:43,761
Can you nod?

68
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:49,201
I guess that's out of the way,
then.

69
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,943
Maybe we should get the tests
over with.

70
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,032
Now?

71
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,950
Give me a minute.

72
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,308
Okay. I'm ready.

73
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,185
Shh.

74
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:18,230
Shh, shh, shh.

75
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,885
Help!

76
00:05:23,714 --> 00:05:26,238
Please, someone!
Please!

77
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,767
Nothing.

78
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,116
Help!
Someone, please!

79
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:37,293
Now, nothing
or nothing at all?

80
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:39,600
We're good.

81
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:47,999
Please!

82
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:54,789
Shh.

83
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:58,619
No one can hear you.

84
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:00,577
We've soundproofed the room.

85
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:02,013
Shh.

86
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:09,717
Now, don't make this
any more unpleasant

87
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:12,328
than it already is.

88
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:16,332
We want you
to be comfortable here.

89
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:21,032
For you,
and for the sake of the baby.

90
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:27,648
You know, I don't want to
have to gag you again,

91
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,650
but I will.

92
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:31,347
Do you understand?

93
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:34,219
Why are you doing this?

94
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:38,310
We need to bring
our grandson back,

95
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,878
and this is
the only way.

96
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:43,359
I can't eat it in the car.

97
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:46,318
Ta-da.

98
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,755
Him?

99
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,718
What do you see?

100
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:57,634
Finished.

101
00:06:57,721 --> 00:07:01,203
You see him?

102
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,640
Oh! He knows.

103
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:07,078
He knows you're here
to save him.

104
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:10,691
I don't know what you're saying.

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Jackson, dear.
He's dead.
Let's make him
a little bit higher.
Oh, Jesus.

106
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:24,444
Oh, no. We don't use
that name in this house.

107
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:27,316
All right. You rest,
and I'll bring you some lunch

108
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:28,709
in a little while.

109
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:31,799
Jackie loves music.

110
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,199
See?

111
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:16,757
Someone, please!

112
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:19,411
Please help me.

113
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:30,814
Have you seen my keys?

114
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:37,125
I thought they were in
my pocket.

115
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:43,523
They're not in my coat.

116
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,401
What?

117
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,232
He showed himself to her.

118
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,450
No.

119
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,843
Mm-hmm.

120
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,062
That's good, right?

121
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,280
Yeah.

122
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,499
The, um...

123
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,109
...appearing.

124
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:06,502
Appearing to the host
is a good thing, right?

125
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:10,550
Mm-hmm.
He's coming back to us.

126
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:18,427
You know,

127
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:20,429
I think I'm going to
stay at home today.

128
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:21,822
I'll call
and I'll reschedule my app...

129
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:22,910
No.

130
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:25,521
No. Keep up appearances.

131
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,218
No changes in our routine.

132
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:30,134
You're right.

133
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:32,833
I always am.

134
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,791
Hmm.

135
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,880
Have a great day.

136
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:58,641
Well, there's something

137
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,382
I didn't think
I'd see in this lifetime.

138
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:02,558
What?

139
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:04,604
You. You're still here.

140
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,521
I shovel your snow.

141
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,482
Oh. Ray, right?

142
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:18,356
- Rory.
- Rory.

143
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:20,881
If you give me two minutes,
I'll clear you a path here

144
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:22,056
right quick.

145
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:24,928
Uh, Mrs. Walsh is pretty sick.

146
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,761
Everything's all right, I hope?

147
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,937
Oh, yeah, yeah. She's just
come down with something,

148
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:35,678
which is why
I'm a little late today.

149
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:37,593
So, I think we should
let her rest this morning.

150
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,901
Of course.

151
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:42,424
Now, if you want,
I can get my shovel.

152
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,121
Whisper quiet.

153
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,732
She'll never even know
I was here.

154
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:47,342
Thank you, but I think
we should let her rest.

155
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:50,562
Okay, okay.

156
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,955
I'll come back
in a couple of days

157
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:53,391
when she's feeling better.

158
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:57,004
Now, if you could just
move your truck

159
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:59,397
so I could get out,
I'm a tad late for work.

160
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:02,313
Ah. Look at me,
screwing with your day.

161
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,142
You wish Mrs. Walsh
a speedy recovery,

162
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:06,883
and you drop me a line
anytime you're ready.

163
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,363
I'll fix you up.

164
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,235
Thank you.
You have a good day, now.

165
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:13,324
You, too.

166
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,992
Hello.

167
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,256
Time for our morning vitamins.

168
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:35,172
Oh, we can't have Mommy
missing out, now, can we?

169
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:38,175
Oop. There.

170
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:44,965
Okay. There you go.

171
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:48,055
No, don't worry.
They're just vitamins.

172
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,670
You see?

173
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,420
There.

174
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:12,166
All right. I get it.

175
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:15,343
It's been a big morning.

176
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,737
I will back off.

177
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:19,477
Hey.

178
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:21,741
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

179
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:25,570
Oh, oh.
You brought your own pills.

180
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:27,485
Are these pre-natals?

181
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:29,357
Gosh. I can't read that.

182
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:31,489
Don't get old.

183
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:33,753
I need to get my glasses.

184
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,018
I will be right back.

185
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,107
Okey-dokey?

186
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:53,381
Yes.

187
00:12:58,473 --> 00:12:59,648
No. No!

188
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:01,084
- Give me the phone.
- No.

189
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:02,999
No extra stress, now. Come on.

190
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:07,090
Thank you.

191
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,573
There you go.

192
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,488
Let's see.

193
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:16,404
5-0-2-9.

194
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:17,709
Stop it.

195
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,015
No, no. It's all right.

196
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:20,364
It's all just part of it.

197
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:23,367
Give me my fucking phone!

198
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:25,413
Oh, no.

199
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,502
Swearing is bad for our baby.

200
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,159
There we go.

201
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:40,210
Oh, I'm sorry to paint you
as a woman

202
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:41,995
who would do this sort of thing,

203
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:45,607
but it's just a little extra
insurance at our end.

204
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:48,653
No. You don't have to do this.

205
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,091
You don't have to do this!

206
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:52,614
Please.

207
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:55,791
All right. I'm sorry.

208
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:58,272
I'm sorry.
I can't do two things at once.

209
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,708
Shh. Shh.

210
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:03,668
All right. Okay.

211
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,196
Um, let me see.

212
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:12,547
Um... All right.

213
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:15,115
That's good.

214
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:20,598
Would you say "Taking a me day"?

215
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:23,471
Henry and I went back and forth
on that.

216
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:25,647
I said,
"Mommy needs some alone time,"

217
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:29,738
but you know, sometimes
you just have to let them win.

218
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:35,352
Well, aren't you popular.

219
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:38,442
Oh.

220
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,662
"DTF"?

221
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:43,708
What in world
does that mean?

222
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:45,797
DT... Down to...

223
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,712
Oh, my goodness.

224
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,150
Well, no wonder
he didn't spell it out.

225
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:51,629
You know,
if you can't even say it,

226
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:53,414
you shouldn't be doing it.

227
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:56,112
That's a good rule of thumb,
I think.

228
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,462
Okay.

229
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:02,727
Um, "Meet me at Fairy Lake,

230
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:06,688
2:00."

231
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:08,603
Send.

232
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,474
All right.

233
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:12,215
There we go.

234
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:18,352
There.

235
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:20,180
Hi, dear. Yeah.

236
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:24,184
I just wanted to let you know
that the plan worked.

237
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:26,403
I made the call
and got the prize.

238
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,190
Wonderful.
You're a full-blown techie now.

239
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:33,193
Have a good day, my love.

240
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,282
Bye-bye.

241
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:49,513
Believe me when I say
we have thought of everything.

242
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,473
No one has more time
than a grieving family.

243
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,562
No one.

244
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:12,710
Dr. Walsh, the hospital called.

245
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:14,712
They're just asking
if you can do a review for them.

246
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,932
Yes, of course.

247
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,414
Um, good.

248
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:21,893
Could you make sure
you forward that, please?

249
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,679
Already sent.

250
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:25,897
Dr. Walsh.

251
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,856
- Colin.
- Hi.

252
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:29,510
To what do we owe the pleasure?

253
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:32,643
First off, I know
what you're going to say.

254
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,777
Yeah. It is entirely possible
that I don't have HPV.

255
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:37,170
I'm sorry for my rudeness.

256
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:38,432
I'm really stressed out
right now, okay?

257
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,824
All righty.

258
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:41,261
And if I could go ahead
of you guys,

259
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:42,697
that would be
really appreciated.

260
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:43,805
Let's go into the back room
now...

261
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:45,047
You have Ms. Becker right now.

262
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:46,918
No, no.
She's not until Friday morning.

263
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,226
No. She rescheduled. She had
a couple of questions for you.

264
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:51,706
No, no. He's got to help me now.

265
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,621
Wait, wait. Uh, no. She said...

266
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,884
- Help me!
- Send an e-mail.

267
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:58,974
No, no.
I still don't see anything.

268
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,889
Did she e-mail you directly,
or...

269
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:02,760
No. That's right.

270
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,675
I saw her this morning.
She was out for a walk...

271
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:06,373
I could be done by now.
I could be done!

272
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,809
And she said that
she couldn't make it today.

273
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:09,637
Okay. Well, Dr. Walsh,
she's 37 weeks.

274
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:11,073
So, is she coming in
later today?

275
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,857
Because the hospital
keeps asking.

276
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:15,251
I have no idea. Could
you just help me here, please?

277
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:16,818
Dr. Walsh, I swear I have it.

278
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,863
Yes. Let's go on at the back.
Thank you.

279
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,649
Uh...

280
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:22,824
I'm so sorry.

281
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:24,130
Here it is.

282
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:25,522
What am I looking at?

283
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:29,048
I found it here this morning.

284
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,832
Okay.

285
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:33,269
Dead, right?

286
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:34,879
Well, I'm not going to touch it,
but yes, it looks dead.

287
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:36,272
Yeah.

288
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,621
What are you doing?

289
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,970
You can't be carrying that
around.

290
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,320
It's a thousand years old.

291
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:41,669
I know.

292
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:43,279
Just hold it here.
Let me open it.

293
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:44,498
Oh.

294
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:49,416
There. Hold that. All right.

295
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:51,505
Just watch.

296
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:04,344
You ready?

297
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:13,483
All right.

298
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,617
Ut aosoth meum sanguinem,

299
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:19,707
dedi sanguinem commutant,

300
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:21,883
ut suus reddet

301
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,364
animam pro animam

302
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:27,454
pulmonis apud.

303
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,898
How did you do that?

304
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:41,555
I found it in the book.

305
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:43,557
I needed to test it to see
if it was real.

306
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:46,734
I wasn't sure I believed it.

307
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:48,997
We can't be bringing dead things
to life.

308
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:51,565
Well, I can.
I've been doing it all morning.

309
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:53,436
All morning?

310
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:54,872
Henry, yes.
Do you know what this means?

311
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,051
It works. The book is real.

312
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,141
We can do this.

313
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:06,971
We're getting him back, my love.

314
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,759
Henry?

315
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,589
Henry?

316
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:17,112
You seem nervous.

317
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,635
Maybe it's because
we have a pregnant woman

318
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:21,377
locked up in our house.

319
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:23,597
We have to keep up appearances.

320
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:26,165
Got it.

321
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:40,396
Hey there, Ian.

322
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:42,137
Henry, Audrey.

323
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,921
Oh.

324
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:45,793
Thank you so much
for the book, Ian.

325
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,404
It was a fascinating read.

326
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:51,102
I'm glad you liked it.

327
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,452
You can still keep it
if you want.

328
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:53,670
No, no. I read it, dear.

329
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:55,194
I know.

330
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:57,761
Let's not be late, hmm?

331
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:02,810
Okay.

332
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:06,117
Uh, Henry? Henry?

333
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:10,165
Remember the Beur book
you were looking for?

334
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,819
Oh, yes.
Uh, that was just curiosity.

335
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:15,692
Yeah. Most subs I'm in
don't think it exists.

336
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:16,911
Well, I appreciate you looking.

337
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,478
Well, I did have a lead.

338
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:22,873
I had a lead, but the guy said
he sold it.

339
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,572
And to be honest with you,
I think he's full of dog shit.

340
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,446
You asked him about it?

341
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:33,101
That was before I found it.
We were desperate.

342
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:35,582
What if he tells somebody?
What if it gets out?

343
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:39,499
Well, it won't get out,
so stop talking about it.

344
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:45,069
I have to eat, you know?
I mean, everyone has to eat.

345
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:46,854
We're human.

346
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:49,813
Looks like we're all here.

347
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,206
I trust everyone had
a good week?

348
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:54,818
- Yep.
- Had a horrible week.

349
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:58,082
My boyfriend graciously
made snacks for everyone,

350
00:20:58,169 --> 00:20:59,649
but if you don't mind,

351
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:01,477
I'd like to wait until after
to enjoy them.

352
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:07,178
Excellent.

353
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,268
Let us begin.

354
00:21:25,588 --> 00:21:29,244
Glory be to Satan,
the Father of the Earth,

355
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:32,552
and to Lucifer,
our guiding light.

356
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,597
As it was in the void
of the beginning,

357
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:38,122
is now, and ever shall be,

358
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:39,863
Satan's kingdom without end.

359
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,127
And so it is done.

360
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:45,173
Hail Satan.

361
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,264
Hail Satan. Hail Satan.

362
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,181
Hail Satan.

363
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:07,282
Well, Miss Becker,

364
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,197
I think it's safe

365
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:13,244
to rule out any chance
of a tapeworm.

366
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,337
Yes. That just leaves me
being pregnant.

367
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:21,862
It certainly does.

368
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:25,692
Oh, my God. I was kidding.

369
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:28,303
I'm so sorry.

370
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,350
I... I thought this would
come as welcome news.

371
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,573
Thank you.

372
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:46,843
You know, there are options.

373
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,672
Out of state, unfortunately.

374
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,720
But also, I could talk to
the father if you wished.

375
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:56,026
Long gone.

376
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:58,115
Didn't even give me
a real name.

377
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,859
Plus I don't really believe in

378
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:07,777
the, uh... option.

379
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:10,258
I see.

380
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:13,174
I promise, I usually
make good decisions.

381
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:15,350
Of course.

382
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:17,613
Um...

383
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:20,877
What about family or friends?

384
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:23,750
I'm sorry. This really is
none of my business.

385
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:27,101
Um,

386
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:29,669
my mom lives in Florida.

387
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:31,758
She might, uh...

388
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:35,675
Oh, I really don't want
to give her another reason

389
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:38,721
to call me a failure.

390
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:40,810
This does not make you
a failure.

391
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:46,947
Right.

392
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:48,427
I guess I'm having a baby.

393
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:51,168
Uh...

394
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:55,085
Oh, yes. You are.

395
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:58,175
Oh, I'm sorry.

396
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:04,704
Sometimes I can be
a little emotional, too.

397
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,054
It's refreshing.

398
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:09,186
It's nice to know
I'll be in good hands.

399
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:11,362
Ah.

400
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,192
Uh, I guess I have
some planning to do.

401
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,238
Uh...

402
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,718
Um, would you mind if I took

403
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:20,937
a photo of you?

404
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:23,810
- A photo?
- Yeah. Just for the records.

405
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:27,030
To match a face to the names.

406
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:29,903
Sadly, at my age,

407
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,296
my memory needs
a bit of a reminder.

408
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:34,298
Sure.

409
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:35,691
I'm sure I look my best.

410
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:40,783
Um, should I say "cheese"?

411
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,872
Say "miracle."

412
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:47,398
Miracle.

413
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:08,463
No, no!

414
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,160
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

415
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:11,510
You won't find him here,
sweetie.

416
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:16,471
No, no!

417
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:17,820
You don't have to do this.

418
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:19,039
Please don't do this.

419
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:24,131
You don't have to do this.

420
00:25:24,218 --> 00:25:27,438
No, no.

421
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:31,878
Just a little bit.

422
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:34,141
- It'll only take a minute.
- Please don't do this.

423
00:25:34,228 --> 00:25:35,359
Please don't do this.

424
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:38,972
All right.

425
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,190
There you go.

426
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:41,627
You don't have to do this.

427
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:45,152
The worst... The worst is over.

428
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:47,241
It's all right. All right.

429
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,203
We ask for an audience.

430
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,380
We wish to invite our dark lord

431
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:58,339
to a seat
at the head of our home.

432
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:00,428
We welcome you.

433
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:08,044
Please don't do this.
Please don't do this.

434
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:10,046
My blood is your blood.

435
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:15,138
My blood is your blood.

436
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:19,186
Don't hurt my baby.
Please don't hurt my baby.

437
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:21,536
Please don't hurt
my baby, no!

438
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:37,247
Start reading.

439
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:48,128
Nos invite Surgot
in domum nostram.

440
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:52,349
Placere reserare

fores condemnabitur.

442
00:26:57,572 --> 00:27:00,140
Keep going.

443
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:02,403
Rogamus autem

444
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,147

445
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:10,411
Hoc reserare in domum suam.

446
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:15,155
I see you!

447
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:19,594
Oh, Jackson.

448
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,944
Oh, he's here.

449
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:23,511
Jackson,

450
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:25,252
come and take the baby.

451
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:27,428
Go on, Jackie. You can do it.

452
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:32,389
Go on. Keep reading.

453
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:36,655
Nos invite mortuis.

454
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:41,529
Nos invitare in domum nostram.

455
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:35,235
Are you all right?

456
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:37,498
Yeah. I'm fine.

457
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:39,587
Henry...

458
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,547
She's okay.

459
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:45,158
Let me hear.

460
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:46,333
Here.

461
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:56,212
It's him.

462
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:57,431
Audrey...

463
00:28:57,518 --> 00:29:00,477
I know my grandson's heartbeat.

464
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:04,177
Yes, yes. Of course you do.
I'm sorry.

465
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:06,266
We did it.

466
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:18,757
I'll put on some tea.

467
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:47,568
Aud?

468
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,798
Had a hell of a time
sleeping last night.

469
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,761
I guess side effects
are to be expected.

470
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:13,028
Sorry. Bad joke.

471
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:17,119
It's all going to work out.

472
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:22,342
I had my doubts,

473
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:25,432
but you were right.

474
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:36,530
Hello?

475
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:40,229
Henry, can you give me
a hand with the groceries?

476
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:42,318
You're not still in bed,
are you?

477
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:51,501
Audrey?

478
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:14,829
Get away.

479
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:17,353
Keep...

480
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,139
Audrey!

481
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:23,403
Audrey!

482
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,649
What's wrong?

483
00:31:52,736 --> 00:31:54,738
What?

484
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:59,265
I, I... You...

485
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:03,138
No. I'm right here. What?

486
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,272
- What?
- All those things.

487
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,187
Well, you just... What?

488
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:10,145
Look. There's nothing there.

489
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:12,669
Hello?

490
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:14,410
Excuse me, Dr. Walsh.

491
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:16,717
There's an officer here
to see you.

492
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:21,722
An officer?

493
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:26,205
Yes. She said
she'd like to speak with you.

494
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,684
I'll be right there.

495
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:30,296
Okay.

496
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:47,748
Dr. Walsh?

497
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:49,837
- Yes?
- Detective Bellows.

498
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:52,883
Is something wrong?

499
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,407
I'm looking into
a missing persons case.

500
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:57,801
Do you know
a Miss Shannon Becker?

501
00:32:57,888 --> 00:33:00,587
Oh, yes. Of course.

502
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:02,502
- She's a patient.
- Yeah?

503
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:03,938
Well, unfortunately,
she hasn't been to work

504
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,505
in a couple of days,

505
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:06,636
and she has
quite a few people worried.

506
00:33:06,723 --> 00:33:09,944
Oh. Well, that's just awful.

507
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:12,599
Um, do you have any leads?

508
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:14,862
Well, we're retracing her steps.

509
00:33:14,949 --> 00:33:16,951
Miss Becker
had an appointment to see you

510
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,300
on the same day
that she went missing.

511
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:20,824
What time did she come in?

512
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:25,438
Ah. Well, actually, um,
she cancelled that day.

513
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:27,788
Do you know when she called?

514
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,311
Do you keep phone records,
by chance?

515
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:30,704
I'd love to have a listen.

516
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:31,792
Actually, she didn't call.

517
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:34,621
Really?

518
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,799
Well, remember,
I asked you if she called,

519
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:40,931
and then you said that
you saw her earlier in the day.

520
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,326
Right, doctor?

521
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:46,589
Oh, right.

522
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:49,331
Thank you, Talia. My mistake.
Yes.

523
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:51,812
I saw her walking.

524
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:54,771
- Walking?
- Uh-huh.

525
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:56,295
And where was this?

526
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:58,732
Um...

527
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:01,865
Do you remember what street?
Time of day?

528
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:03,476
Anything would be helpful.

529
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:05,043
Um, yeah.

530
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,567
I was on my way to work.
She walked by my house.

531
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:09,786
It would've been
about 9:00, 9:30.

532
00:34:09,873 --> 00:34:12,050
Sorry.
I should've remembered.

533
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:16,054
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.

534
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:17,490
Which street was this?

535
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:20,797
My street. Hibiscus Avenue.

536
00:34:20,884 --> 00:34:23,496
Thank you.

537
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,411
This has been very helpful.

538
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:27,456
Both of you.

539
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:29,545
Well, please keep us posted.

540
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,813
You're panicking.

541
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,728
She was in my office.

542
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:41,949
Well, we knew this.
It's not a shock, Henry.

543
00:34:42,036 --> 00:34:43,603
We planned for it.

544
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,474
They came in,

545
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:47,911
and you told them that she'd
cancelled her appointment.

546
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:49,913
And then they'll look at
her updates and her dating app

547
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,352
and see that she met
a stranger.

548
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:55,571
We've been all through this.

549
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:57,182
Well, there was some confusion.

550
00:34:57,269 --> 00:35:00,315
I had to tell the police
that I saw her walk...

551
00:35:00,402 --> 00:35:02,491
What?

552
00:35:02,578 --> 00:35:05,886
Well, it's fine.
Nothing changes.

553
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:08,541
I just said that
I saw her walking

554
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:09,933
and she cancelled.

555
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,848
What reason did she give
for cancelling?

556
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:13,633
Well, we didn't...

557
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,678
Did she go left or right
at the bottom of the hill?

558
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:18,551
- I mean...
- I know what you're doing.

559
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:20,379
Why were you watching her
all the way down

560
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:21,989
to the bottom of the hill?

561
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,904
Are you attracted to
younger girls, Henry?

562
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:25,732
It's not a plan
if you don't stick to it.

563
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:28,778
All right, now.

564
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:30,998
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

565
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:32,521
But we'll go
over all this tonight.

566
00:35:32,608 --> 00:35:34,523
Okay, Audrey?

567
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:38,136
- Damn it.
- What's the matter?

568
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:40,399
Well, it's probably the police
at the door.

569
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:58,808
I'm coming.

570
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:06,120
Trick or treat?

571
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,775
What?

572
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:11,778
Trick or treat?

573
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:13,432
That's not very funny.

574
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,783
I don't like games.

575
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:20,917
Whoever put you up to this
is just cruel.

576
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:22,745
Please don't knock again.

577
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:24,921
Trick or treat?

578
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Trick or treat?

579
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:14,536
No!

580
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:31,161
Trick or treat?

581
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,772
Please?

582
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

583
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:17,773
Hello?

584
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,992
Henry? Henry, I need help.

585
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,950
What's wrong?

586
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:22,300
She's trying to get me.

587
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:24,563
Trick or treat?

588
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,826
Get out!

589
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:30,743
Maybe you should give her
your soul.

590
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,918
What?

591
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:33,659
Trick or treat?

592
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:35,269
- Trick or treat?
- What?

593
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:36,966
Trick or treat?

594
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:38,403
What?

595
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,102
Trick or treat? Trick or treat?

596
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:45,105
Trick or treat?

597
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:52,678
Oh. Oh, God.

598
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:12,872
Trick or treat?

599
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:17,790
Trick or treat?

600
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:21,968
Trick or treat?

601
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,115
No.

602
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:41,161
Why were you screaming?

603
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,860
Screaming?

604
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:46,601
Earlier. I heard you screaming.

605
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:52,999
My daughter just came to see me.

606
00:39:56,829 --> 00:40:00,833
She used to dress as a ghost
every year for Halloween.

607
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,663
I tried to get her into

608
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:08,797
a princess costume
or a ballerina,

609
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:13,323
anything other than
that darn ghost.

610
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,849
But they like what they like.

611
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:21,288
I can't believe
I tried to change that.

612
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,986
Seems so silly now,
when I look back.

613
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:28,295
Where's your daughter now?

614
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:35,781
I love my Jackson.

615
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:39,872
And Jackson loves
his gammy's cookies.

616
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:42,962
I'm going to make some
right now.

617
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Whoa, whoa!

618
00:44:09,995 --> 00:44:12,606
I can't get the door open.

619
00:44:34,584 --> 00:44:36,674
Aud?

620
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:41,330
What the hell is going on?

621
00:45:08,444 --> 00:45:12,100
She's all stitched up.

622
00:45:12,187 --> 00:45:14,189
No real damage.

623
00:45:14,276 --> 00:45:15,974
I'm so sorry.

624
00:45:16,061 --> 00:45:17,671
No.

625
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:20,935
Whatever this is,
we both did it.

626
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:30,597
You know,
I think we're in over our heads.

627
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:35,558
Well, we can't Google this.

628
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:42,348
Do you think we made a mistake?

629
00:45:42,435 --> 00:45:44,742
Let's get some sleep.

630
00:46:17,513 --> 00:46:18,645
Good morning.

631
00:46:18,732 --> 00:46:20,212
Right on schedule.

632
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:22,736
If I don't do it in the morning,
I don't do it.

633
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:25,043
And someone seems to crave
the consistency.

634
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,001
Better get used to it.

635
00:46:27,088 --> 00:46:30,483
Pretty soon, that little person
will be calling all the shots.

636
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,093
I am.

637
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,400
Sorry?

638
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:36,184
Um, getting used it, I mean.

639
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:39,144
I know I was apprehensive.

640
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:41,407
But, uh, I was laying in bed
the other day

641
00:46:41,494 --> 00:46:43,322
worrying about bills
and formula.

642
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:47,456
And all of a sudden, this
little mush starts squirming.

643
00:46:47,543 --> 00:46:49,458
Yeah, right.

644
00:46:49,545 --> 00:46:53,201
It made all my worries go away.

645
00:46:53,288 --> 00:46:55,247
I finally found my family.

646
00:46:57,423 --> 00:46:59,338
They do have a way of
getting into your heart,

647
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:00,818
don't they?

648
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:05,300
They really do.

649
00:47:05,387 --> 00:47:06,432
Well, I'm glad

650
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:09,565
that you're excited to be a mom.

651
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:12,830
You have no idea.
Um, I'll see you Thursday?

652
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:15,093
Wouldn't miss it.

653
00:47:18,923 --> 00:47:22,100
Are there more?

654
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,104
Yes.

655
00:47:26,191 --> 00:47:28,628
How can you tell?

656
00:47:28,715 --> 00:47:31,718
I tend to notice a murder
of crows in my backyard.

657
00:47:34,808 --> 00:47:37,115
It's because of what we did?

658
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:40,422
Yep.

659
00:47:40,509 --> 00:47:42,511
It's because of what we did.

660
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:50,215
Oh, no.

661
00:47:55,742 --> 00:47:57,309
What's he doing here?

662
00:47:57,396 --> 00:47:59,398
Go on upstairs. Keep her quiet.

663
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:29,907
Dr. Walsh? Morning.
I'm here to clean your drive.

664
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:33,649
Uh, yeah. I thought we talked
about this. We're still okay.

665
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:36,565
Pretty sure you and I got a
different meaning of "okay."

666
00:48:36,652 --> 00:48:38,437
Yes, but I called, though.

667
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:39,699
What's that?

668
00:48:39,786 --> 00:48:43,572
Um, after last time,

669
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:45,879
uh, I called your wife,

670
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:49,491
and I explained that I wouldn't
need you for a month or two.

671
00:48:49,578 --> 00:48:51,363
We're not firing you
or anything.

672
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:52,886
We just don't need you.

673
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:54,932
Oh, boy.

674
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:59,240
Full disclosure here, doc.

675
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:01,895
I haven't been home in a while.

676
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,723
Is that right?

677
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,378
The number you called is Jenny.

678
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:09,903
On account of taxes,
everything's in her name,

679
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,558
and she's gone and chucked me.

680
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:15,169
I mean, I get it.
I made a mistake.

681
00:49:15,256 --> 00:49:18,303
A stupid, stupid mistake.

682
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:21,262
And now, will you look
at all this, huh?

683
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:23,699
I'm going to lose my business,
my home.

684
00:49:23,786 --> 00:49:25,658
Cripes. She won't even
let me see my two girls.

685
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:27,399
How the hell is that fair?

686
00:49:27,486 --> 00:49:29,879
I'm sorry to hear that, Rory.
But maybe you could, um,

687
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,838
send her some flowers
or something.

688
00:49:31,925 --> 00:49:36,190
Oh! What am I doing?

689
00:49:36,277 --> 00:49:38,932
This isn't on you.

690
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:41,891
No. Uh...

691
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,242
That's it. It's over. No more.

692
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:45,939
Well, that's good to know.

693
00:49:46,026 --> 00:49:48,898
Um, I'll be seeing you, then,
Rory.

694
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,814
No, no, no. I'm not leaving.
You're getting a freebie.

695
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:53,338
No, no. Everything's okay.

696
00:49:53,425 --> 00:49:56,254
No. It's settled.
You need it. I need it.

697
00:49:56,341 --> 00:49:59,344
Done-zo. I am hooking you up.

698
00:50:00,954 --> 00:50:03,739
Henry?

699
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:11,225
What the hell was that?

700
00:50:11,312 --> 00:50:13,967
Don't yell at me.
I am not a doctor.

701
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,767
I thought you told me
you cancelled him?

702
00:50:31,854 --> 00:50:36,033
I did! He wouldn't take
no for an answer.

703
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,904
Hey!

704
00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:40,472
Hey!

705
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:41,473
Oh...

706
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,474
Hey, Mrs. Walsh!

707
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:43,475
Wave.

708
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:44,476
Hi!

709
00:50:44,563 --> 00:50:48,001
Smile.

710
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:49,481
Glad you're feeling better!

711
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:51,744
Thank you, Rory.

712
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:00,318
Hey. Hey...

713
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:01,536
What's wrong?

714
00:51:01,623 --> 00:51:03,103
I just...

715
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:04,757
I don't know what
the other ghosts are.

716
00:51:04,844 --> 00:51:06,367
I don't know why they're here.

717
00:51:06,454 --> 00:51:08,804
What if we did it all wrong?

718
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:10,850
What if...
What if Jackson's not...

719
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:13,679
No. In a few days,

720
00:51:13,766 --> 00:51:15,985
we'll have Jackson back,
we'll head to Mexico...

721
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,335
Okay.

722
00:51:17,422 --> 00:51:19,337
And I'll burn
this house down,

723
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:22,775
ghosts and all. I promise.

724
00:51:24,733 --> 00:51:25,952
Hey!

725
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,392
You did it right.
Jackson's in there.

726
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:35,440
He's coming back to you.

727
00:52:07,689 --> 00:52:10,649
Stay the hell away from me.

728
00:52:10,736 --> 00:52:15,132
No, I-I'm just here to
clean you, nothing else.

729
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:18,004
All right.

730
00:52:25,577 --> 00:52:28,101
There we go.

731
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:33,585
Oh...

732
00:52:33,672 --> 00:52:38,024
Wrists are just not getting
any blood circulation.

733
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:44,900
Please don't move.

734
00:52:52,517 --> 00:52:54,736
There.

735
00:52:54,823 --> 00:52:56,651
Okay.

736
00:53:00,133 --> 00:53:03,919
This will just
make it a lot...

737
00:53:04,006 --> 00:53:07,793
softer for you. Okay?

738
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,882
I hope this works.

739
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,974
You ready?

740
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:27,508
There. How does that feel?

741
00:53:31,077 --> 00:53:34,559
Are you gonna kill me?

742
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:37,649
When this is over

743
00:53:37,736 --> 00:53:39,825
and you have your
grandson back?

744
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:48,181
You're not saying anything.

745
00:53:50,705 --> 00:53:53,447
There's...

746
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:56,755
a... lot of words in silence.

747
00:54:02,543 --> 00:54:06,199
Does that mean yes?

748
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:09,898
Shannon, the first rule
we set for ourselves

749
00:54:09,985 --> 00:54:14,773
was that you cannot get hurt.

750
00:54:17,602 --> 00:54:20,996
You know, you remind me of her.

751
00:54:24,173 --> 00:54:27,525
Your daughter?

752
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:32,138
She was such a good girl.

753
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:36,708
She was always so much
smarter than the other kids.

754
00:54:36,795 --> 00:54:38,753
She always knew
what she wanted.

755
00:54:43,628 --> 00:54:45,891
Did you try
and bring her back?

756
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:52,158
I don't think she can come back.

757
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:54,943
She was in the car, but...

758
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:58,556
we didn't lose her right away.

759
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:02,908
We... We renovated this house

760
00:55:02,995 --> 00:55:07,782
to give her
everything she needed.

761
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:09,741
Henry and I tried to make her
as comfortable as possible,

762
00:55:09,828 --> 00:55:11,656
so that she could...

763
00:55:11,743 --> 00:55:15,094
try to move on.

764
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:18,663
But...

765
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:22,754
I didn't realize how impossible

766
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:27,106
it is to move on
after losing a child...

767
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:30,979
until I lost mine.

768
00:55:40,293 --> 00:55:42,643
But you know,

769
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:46,299
I know that she would be happy

770
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:49,781
knowing that you're helping
bring our Jackson back.

771
00:56:03,882 --> 00:56:07,146
Oh, God damn it.

772
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:30,691
Yes. Hello?

773
00:56:30,778 --> 00:56:31,953
Dr. Walsh?

774
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,172
It is.

775
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:34,869
This is Detective Bellows.

776
00:56:34,956 --> 00:56:36,871
We met a few days
ago at your office.

777
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,917
Uh-huh.

778
00:56:39,004 --> 00:56:41,093
Sorry to disturb you.

779
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:43,922
I'm just following up
on a few notes.

780
00:56:44,009 --> 00:56:45,750
I remembered you saying you saw

781
00:56:45,837 --> 00:56:49,101
Miss Becker walking
the morning she went missing.

782
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:53,018
I wondered if I could come
see you for a quick chat?

783
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:57,022
Uh, yes, of course.

784
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:58,415
Always happy to help.

785
00:57:00,025 --> 00:57:02,941
Have you had any luck
in finding Miss Becker?

786
00:57:03,028 --> 00:57:05,726
Um... I saw on the news that
you might have got a suspect.

787
00:57:05,813 --> 00:57:07,685
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that with you.

788
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:12,037
No, of course. I was just,
uh, concerned about her.

789
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:15,823
You know that, um, she... she's
due to give birth any day now.

790
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,391
Uh-huh.
Can I come by your house?

791
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:22,047
Well, actually,
I'm out right now.

792
00:57:22,134 --> 00:57:24,832
But how about
we meet at the clinic

793
00:57:24,919 --> 00:57:26,747
tomorrow morning first thing?

794
00:57:26,834 --> 00:57:28,357
Aww, Doctor,

795
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,316
time is of the essence
in these circumstances,

796
00:57:30,403 --> 00:57:31,752
you understand.

797
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,450
Well, of course.
Um... Yes.

798
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:38,193
You know, I... actually,
I could be there in... in...

799
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,847
in an hour.

800
00:57:39,934 --> 00:57:41,283
I'm actually
in your neighbourhood.

801
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,851
Let's meet at your house.

802
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:05,743
Ahh!

803
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:11,096
I would help.

804
00:58:11,183 --> 00:58:14,795
What do you mean?

805
00:58:14,882 --> 00:58:18,233
Be Jackson's mom...

806
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:22,237
with you and Dr. Walsh.

807
00:58:22,324 --> 00:58:25,066
You're just saying that.

808
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,288
Yeah, Henry told me that...

809
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:32,204
that you would try and use
my emotions against me.

810
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,728
Shame on you.

811
00:58:34,815 --> 00:58:36,861
I'm not... I...

812
00:58:39,907 --> 00:58:41,213
I...

813
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,085
I don't... agree with this,

814
00:58:44,172 --> 00:58:46,305
but...

815
00:58:46,392 --> 00:58:48,394
I understand it.

816
00:58:50,918 --> 00:58:52,354
Doing anything for him.

817
00:58:52,441 --> 00:58:56,271
I'm just trying to
do the same for my baby.

818
00:58:58,143 --> 00:59:01,450
I don't know.

819
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,801
You and Dr. Walsh aren't young.

820
00:59:03,888 --> 00:59:05,150
You're gonna need someone

821
00:59:05,237 --> 00:59:08,980
to look after Jackson.

822
00:59:09,067 --> 00:59:13,201
You can lock me up in a room.
I don't care. I just...

823
00:59:13,288 --> 00:59:15,421
I just... I just want to be
a part of the baby's life.

824
00:59:17,466 --> 00:59:20,513
Do you really think
you could do that?

825
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,516
Like, if I talk to Henry,
you're not just saying it?

826
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:26,127
I do.
I'll do whatever you want.

827
00:59:27,912 --> 00:59:29,435
Please.

828
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:39,445
I'm sorry.

829
00:59:39,532 --> 00:59:42,491
I'll come back and take
that off in a minute.

830
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:32,019
Henry Walsh!

831
01:00:32,106 --> 01:00:33,847
Henry, I tried to stop her!

832
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:36,328
Place your hands on your head
and get on your knees.

833
01:00:36,415 --> 01:00:39,026
Are you okay, my love?

834
01:00:39,113 --> 01:00:42,247
Henry, I'm so sorry!

835
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:45,206
Henry Walsh, get down
on your knees now.

836
01:00:45,293 --> 01:00:47,426
- Let me go!
- I'm sorry.

837
01:00:47,513 --> 01:00:49,123
No, it's all me,
Officer. Please.

838
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:50,342
My... my wife had nothing
to do with this. Please.

839
01:00:50,429 --> 01:00:52,213
Please, let her go.

840
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,606
Let me up, please.
You have to help my baby.

841
01:00:53,693 --> 01:00:55,086
Dr. Walsh, I am placing
you under arrest

842
01:00:55,173 --> 01:00:57,088
for the kidnapping
of Miss Shannon Becker.

843
01:00:57,175 --> 01:00:58,480
Please!

844
01:00:58,567 --> 01:00:59,525
Please, no!
Just let me out of here.

845
01:00:59,612 --> 01:01:00,918
Miss Becker, calm down.

846
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:02,571
You have to let me out.

847
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,182
I know you're afraid,
but it's all over now.

848
01:01:04,269 --> 01:01:06,227
I just have to
do this one thing.

849
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:28,293
Oh, Henry...

850
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,686
It can't be...

851
01:01:32,036 --> 01:01:34,647
Can you help me? Henry...

852
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:36,562
There we go.

853
01:01:43,308 --> 01:01:44,309
Oh my God.

854
01:01:48,095 --> 01:01:50,184
Don't look.
Did she call for backup?

855
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:51,403
I don't know.

856
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:52,621
- The cop.
- What?

857
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,014
Did she call for backup?

858
01:01:54,101 --> 01:01:55,233
- No, no.
- No?

859
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,625
No, she heard Becker.

860
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:57,931
I tried to get
rid of her, Henry.

861
01:01:58,018 --> 01:01:59,585
I tried to get rid of her.

862
01:01:59,672 --> 01:02:02,153
I know. Let's...
let's get her away from here.

863
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,504
- What?
- Come on.

864
01:02:05,591 --> 01:02:06,984
Oh my God.

865
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:08,420
I'll get an arm,
you get an arm.

866
01:02:08,507 --> 01:02:10,248
Get her arm. Come on.

867
01:02:10,335 --> 01:02:12,076
Where are we gonna take her?

868
01:02:12,163 --> 01:02:13,381
Back side, just right
in the corner.

869
01:02:13,468 --> 01:02:15,296
All right.
All right.

870
01:02:15,383 --> 01:02:18,691
Good.

871
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,626
Will you please stop that?

872
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,239
I'm nervous.

873
01:02:45,326 --> 01:02:47,111
I'm aware.

874
01:02:49,113 --> 01:02:51,028
We need to talk about Becker.

875
01:02:51,115 --> 01:02:52,769
She and I were chatting.

876
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:55,423
I-I know I'm always the one
yelling about plans,

877
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,642
but just hear me out.

878
01:02:59,384 --> 01:03:02,169
Later, okay?

879
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,179
Do you actually have it?
Like, actually have it?

880
01:03:12,266 --> 01:03:14,138
Come inside.

881
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:25,105
Where did you find this?

882
01:03:25,192 --> 01:03:29,327
I went to a museum.
Talked to some historians.

883
01:03:29,414 --> 01:03:33,505
One of them sent me to
another guy, and another guy.

884
01:03:33,592 --> 01:03:37,074
Eventually, I flew to Jerusalem

885
01:03:37,161 --> 01:03:41,121
and bought it off a very
shady-looking individual,

886
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:44,037
who seemed only too pleased
to be rid of it.

887
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:49,173
How much did it cost?

888
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:54,134
Well, we don't have
a retirement plan left.

889
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:56,093
Can you read it, Ian?

890
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:59,139
Of course I can read it.

891
01:03:59,226 --> 01:04:03,796
Some of it, not all of it.

892
01:04:03,883 --> 01:04:06,668
It looks like it was written...

893
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:08,496
over a bunch of years.

894
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,716
There's different languages,
there's different dialects

895
01:04:10,803 --> 01:04:12,457
and religions.

896
01:04:12,544 --> 01:04:14,546
This might be the
oldest book in the world.

897
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,162
Ian?

898
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:24,556
We're friends, right?

899
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:28,386
I don't have friends.

900
01:04:28,473 --> 01:04:30,649
But we're bound to
each other with the church.

901
01:04:30,736 --> 01:04:32,477
Of course.

902
01:04:32,564 --> 01:04:35,306
So...

903
01:04:35,393 --> 01:04:39,440
could you show what
you make of this here,

904
01:04:39,527 --> 01:04:42,182
where it says "the invoking",

905
01:04:42,269 --> 01:04:46,839
where you can invite a
spirit into a new vessel?

906
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:49,842
Well, first of all,

907
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:53,280
you can't invite a specific...

908
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:56,805
Did you guys do this?

909
01:04:59,634 --> 01:05:03,247
Wh-wh-what if we did?

910
01:05:04,683 --> 01:05:08,687
Then, I'd be an
idiot for standing here. So...

911
01:05:10,254 --> 01:05:11,733
It's okay.

912
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:14,867
Okay.

913
01:05:14,954 --> 01:05:17,348
You guys...

914
01:05:17,435 --> 01:05:21,221
need to tell exactly, exactly...

915
01:05:21,308 --> 01:05:22,353
Uh-huh.

916
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,616
...what you did right now.

917
01:05:24,703 --> 01:05:27,532
Um... okay, well,

918
01:05:27,619 --> 01:05:29,882
we, uh... yeah,

919
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:32,537
we asked this one
to bring our grandson back.

920
01:05:34,756 --> 01:05:38,543
You asked Surgat
to bring him back?

921
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:41,328
The book said he could.

922
01:05:41,415 --> 01:05:43,374
No. Henry...

923
01:05:43,461 --> 01:05:46,377
your translations
are so far off.

924
01:05:46,464 --> 01:05:48,857
Yes, this is Surgat,

925
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:52,600
the demon who unlocks the gate
between us and tormented souls.

926
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:53,993
And, yes,

927
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,735
technically,
he is the first step

928
01:05:56,822 --> 01:05:59,433
in bringing... someone back,

929
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,393
but it's not a private
goddamn VIP invitation.

930
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,875
Okay, once that gate is open,

931
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,443
every ghost in purgatory

932
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:13,795
is gonna be crawling
to find a host.

933
01:06:18,365 --> 01:06:20,933
What host did you use?

934
01:06:34,512 --> 01:06:35,774
Is she alive?

935
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:38,603
Yes. Uh, sedated.

936
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:41,954
When did you...
when did you do it?

937
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:44,957
A few days ago.

938
01:06:45,044 --> 01:06:47,264
This is hers?

939
01:06:47,351 --> 01:06:51,398
No. That's... someone else's.

940
01:06:51,485 --> 01:06:54,749
Is Jackson in there?

941
01:06:54,836 --> 01:06:56,925
Who's Jackson?

942
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,232
Um, our grandson...

943
01:06:59,319 --> 01:07:02,453
the reason that
we're doing this.

944
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:05,934
Oh. Um...

945
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,676
No.

946
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:12,811
But he can be. He can be.

947
01:07:16,597 --> 01:07:18,382
You guys only did
half the ceremony.

948
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:23,996
I'm not gonna...
praise you for your choices,

949
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:27,826
but... you actually
did the right thing.

950
01:07:27,913 --> 01:07:32,048
Now, you need to follow up.

951
01:07:33,919 --> 01:07:35,355
Trade the life,

952
01:07:35,442 --> 01:07:38,010
invite him in.

953
01:07:41,883 --> 01:07:43,363
Trade?

954
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:48,020
The mother trades her life,

955
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:51,937
so the tormented can come back.

956
01:07:52,024 --> 01:07:55,332
You... you think
that you can perform this?

957
01:07:55,419 --> 01:07:58,422
Of course I can.

958
01:07:58,509 --> 01:08:00,946
I studied my
whole life for this.

959
01:08:01,033 --> 01:08:03,905
I just can't believe it's real.

960
01:08:07,909 --> 01:08:11,043
I get to keep the book
when we're done.

961
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:13,480
Of course.

962
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:17,441
And $10,000 as well.

963
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:24,361
I don't have a
lot of money and...

964
01:08:24,448 --> 01:08:28,016
you seem to have more.

965
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,367
No problem.

966
01:08:30,454 --> 01:08:32,412
When do you
think that you could do this?

967
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:35,372
How quickly?

968
01:08:35,459 --> 01:08:37,722
ASAP. As soon as possible.

969
01:08:37,809 --> 01:08:40,812
Tomorrow work for you guys?

970
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:43,423
I'm gonna have get some stuff.

971
01:08:45,991 --> 01:08:47,862
I'm assuming you've
seen some ghosts, huh?

972
01:08:47,949 --> 01:08:49,125
Mm-hmm.

973
01:08:49,212 --> 01:08:52,389
You're gonna need salt,

974
01:08:52,476 --> 01:08:56,741
rock salt, kosher only.

975
01:08:56,828 --> 01:09:01,398
Spread it all
around this... woman here.

976
01:09:01,485 --> 01:09:04,009
That unborn baby's literally

977
01:09:04,096 --> 01:09:07,055
a free ticket back
to life for those things.

978
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,970
Salt keeps them away?

979
01:09:09,057 --> 01:09:10,755
I don't fucking know, Henry.

980
01:09:10,842 --> 01:09:13,540
But I've read it helps,
so do it. Okay?

981
01:09:13,627 --> 01:09:16,413
And put it around
yourselves, too.

982
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:20,373
You aren't ideal,
but they're not picky.

983
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:24,682
I think I'm gonna... go.

984
01:09:24,769 --> 01:09:26,510
I don't really feel
safe being here...

985
01:09:26,597 --> 01:09:28,947
until we do this.

986
01:09:54,059 --> 01:09:58,933
He says
you have to kill me.

987
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,935
Mm-hmm.

988
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:15,907
Mrs. Walsh said that
I could be the mom to Jackson.

989
01:10:17,561 --> 01:10:19,563
Did she talk to you about that?

990
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,788
How many more people have to die

991
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:29,442
just to bring
your grandson back?

992
01:10:29,529 --> 01:10:33,533
All of them.
Whatever it takes.

993
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:36,623
Rory, the cop, you, me.

994
01:10:39,104 --> 01:10:42,063
You can't win a moral
argument with me.

995
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:44,979
I've made a deal with the devil.

996
01:10:49,549 --> 01:10:52,030
You haven't made the deal yet.

997
01:10:52,117 --> 01:10:55,642
I made that deal
the day we lost Jackson.

998
01:11:00,995 --> 01:11:02,519
I know you love him.

999
01:11:04,303 --> 01:11:06,262
Her.

1000
01:11:10,918 --> 01:11:13,094
When it happened,
she couldn't remember a thing,

1001
01:11:13,181 --> 01:11:16,620
but I know that she
was distracted.

1002
01:11:16,707 --> 01:11:20,580
She didn't resist
fussing over Jackson,

1003
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:23,627
especially on car rides.

1004
01:11:26,151 --> 01:11:28,936
She was driving a car?

1005
01:11:36,161 --> 01:11:39,730
I realize that she couldn't
accept what happened

1006
01:11:39,817 --> 01:11:43,908
and I couldn't expect her to...

1007
01:11:43,995 --> 01:11:47,781
come back up.

1008
01:11:47,868 --> 01:11:50,262
So...

1009
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:55,223
I joined her,
going back down.

1010
01:11:59,097 --> 01:12:02,013
You're doing all this for her?

1011
01:12:07,671 --> 01:12:09,977
I do everything for her.

1012
01:12:17,245 --> 01:12:20,118
I'm sorry.

1013
01:12:20,205 --> 01:12:24,209
People say "sorry"
instead of fixing things.

1014
01:12:24,296 --> 01:12:27,604
You could fix this,

1015
01:12:27,691 --> 01:12:29,823
but you choose not to.

1016
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
So... you aren't.
What if...

1017
01:12:49,974 --> 01:12:54,370
I hope that happens
for the rest of your life.

1018
01:13:16,827 --> 01:13:19,264
Ian, come to supper please.

1019
01:13:22,223 --> 01:13:24,269
Not hungry.

1020
01:13:24,356 --> 01:13:28,360
I'll keep it warm
in the oven for you.

1021
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,237
Are you sure you don't want
something? Just a little?

1022
01:13:43,288 --> 01:13:46,422
Sweetie, I really don't mind.
I'll bring down to you.

1023
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:49,207
Not fucking hungry!

1024
01:14:05,919 --> 01:14:08,008
Henry?

1025
01:14:08,095 --> 01:14:10,271
Audrey?

1026
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,931
Guys?

1027
01:14:18,018 --> 01:14:21,152
Guys?

1028
01:14:28,855 --> 01:14:30,727
She's been doing that all night.

1029
01:14:30,814 --> 01:14:32,685
Don't step on the salt.

1030
01:14:36,907 --> 01:14:39,126
Okay.

1031
01:14:41,999 --> 01:14:45,829
Turn to the page with
the bookmark, read it.

1032
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:58,189
"Hoc autem..."

1033
01:14:58,276 --> 01:15:01,497
"Hoc au-tem".

1034
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:05,936
"Hoc autem satanas
in domum suam,

1035
01:15:06,023 --> 01:15:09,853
"invenit eum coram te relinquo."

1036
01:15:12,203 --> 01:15:16,990
What does it mean?

1037
01:15:17,077 --> 01:15:20,211
The salt slows them down...

1038
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:25,346
The sacrifice
keeps them away.

1039
01:15:30,351 --> 01:15:34,442
This will help keep them out...

1040
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,096
until...

1041
01:15:36,183 --> 01:15:40,361
we're ready... to do this.

1042
01:15:44,278 --> 01:15:47,412
Don't disturb it, please.

1043
01:15:50,284 --> 01:15:53,461
One of you starts with...

1044
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,420
this.

1045
01:15:58,466 --> 01:16:02,906
I know it's in here...
somewhere.

1046
01:16:02,993 --> 01:16:05,517
One of you starts with this.

1047
01:16:05,604 --> 01:16:09,521
The other, come with me.

1048
01:16:24,275 --> 01:16:26,799
One, two,

1049
01:16:26,886 --> 01:16:31,456
three, four, five, six.

1050
01:16:35,895 --> 01:16:40,117
Here. Here.

1051
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:51,868
You know when it comes time,

1052
01:16:51,955 --> 01:16:54,871
you're gonna have to be
the one to kill her, Henry.

1053
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:56,350
I can't do that for you.

1054
01:16:56,437 --> 01:16:58,352
You don't have to
worry about that.

1055
01:16:58,439 --> 01:16:59,571
I'll take care of it.

1056
01:16:59,658 --> 01:17:02,574
You can't hesitate.

1057
01:17:05,969 --> 01:17:07,405
Okay? If he senses
that you're not ready,

1058
01:17:07,492 --> 01:17:08,624
Henry...

1059
01:17:08,711 --> 01:17:11,061
Henry!

1060
01:17:11,148 --> 01:17:14,586
...we'll all die. We'll all die.

1061
01:17:14,673 --> 01:17:17,284
I'm not saying this to be mean,

1062
01:17:17,371 --> 01:17:19,199
but this is your deal.

1063
01:17:19,286 --> 01:17:21,245
I'm just here to broker it.

1064
01:17:21,332 --> 01:17:23,421
I told you,
I'll take care of it.

1065
01:17:23,508 --> 01:17:26,206
Ian, this will work, right?

1066
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:29,601
He's listening,

1067
01:17:29,688 --> 01:17:32,082
Henry.

1068
01:17:32,169 --> 01:17:35,085
He actually wants to hear you.

1069
01:17:37,391 --> 01:17:38,915
Please don't ever

1070
01:17:39,002 --> 01:17:42,135
doubt him in my presence again.

1071
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:46,487
Three more to go.

1072
01:17:57,063 --> 01:17:59,065
Is it today?

1073
01:18:01,154 --> 01:18:02,982
It is.

1074
01:18:05,724 --> 01:18:09,206
And you spoke to Dr. Walsh?

1075
01:18:09,293 --> 01:18:12,992
About me coming with you?
Raising Jackson with you?

1076
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:14,646
We did.

1077
01:18:14,733 --> 01:18:18,041
He thinks it's a great idea.

1078
01:18:22,219 --> 01:18:23,742
So, when this is over

1079
01:18:23,829 --> 01:18:27,224
and you have Jackson,
with the ceremony...

1080
01:18:29,052 --> 01:18:31,576
...you're gonna
let me out of these?

1081
01:18:31,663 --> 01:18:33,491
We are.

1082
01:18:33,578 --> 01:18:35,406
We're... we're even gonna
have a room for you,

1083
01:18:35,493 --> 01:18:38,365
with a crib and everything.

1084
01:18:52,249 --> 01:18:53,641
I was thinking, uh,

1085
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,514
maybe we could
send my mom a picture

1086
01:18:56,601 --> 01:18:58,516
of the baby when he's born?

1087
01:18:58,603 --> 01:19:01,040
We're not close, but, uh...

1088
01:19:04,087 --> 01:19:08,091
She'll still be really
excited to be a grandma.

1089
01:19:10,223 --> 01:19:12,704
Well, that's a great idea.
Let's do that.

1090
01:19:17,274 --> 01:19:19,102
I'm kind of hungry.

1091
01:19:21,582 --> 01:19:23,236
I...

1092
01:19:23,323 --> 01:19:25,717
I just want to make sure
I have my strength for this.

1093
01:19:25,804 --> 01:19:28,676
Okay.

1094
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,027
Let me fix you something.

1095
01:20:02,449 --> 01:20:04,495
Shannon?

1096
01:20:25,342 --> 01:20:27,431
Mrs. Walsh!

1097
01:20:27,518 --> 01:20:30,477
- Mrs. Walsh!
- What?

1098
01:20:30,564 --> 01:20:32,044
My water broke.

1099
01:20:32,131 --> 01:20:35,221
Oh my goodness.

1100
01:20:35,308 --> 01:20:38,790
Henry! Henry!

1101
01:20:38,877 --> 01:20:41,358
She never starts
meetings with a blessing,

1102
01:20:41,445 --> 01:20:44,361
she never acknowledges
the work that I do

1103
01:20:44,448 --> 01:20:46,145
to make those meetings
even fucking happen.

1104
01:20:46,232 --> 01:20:49,148
You think that twat
could help you with this?

1105
01:20:49,235 --> 01:20:50,846
No, no.

1106
01:20:50,933 --> 01:20:53,326
You're certainly the one
that should be running it.

1107
01:20:53,413 --> 01:20:56,634
Yeah. She doesn't
even care about the church.

1108
01:20:56,721 --> 01:20:59,289
She's a stupid...

1109
01:20:59,376 --> 01:21:00,856
stupid skank.

1110
01:21:00,943 --> 01:21:04,120
Speak of the devil.

1111
01:21:08,733 --> 01:21:10,691
Henry!

1112
01:21:24,749 --> 01:21:26,794
All right. Let's get this off.

1113
01:21:29,754 --> 01:21:31,712
How much time
between contractions?

1114
01:21:31,799 --> 01:21:34,193
It's hard to tell. I...

1115
01:21:36,761 --> 01:21:41,418
Ahh!

1116
01:21:41,505 --> 01:21:44,551
What are you waiting for?

1117
01:21:50,775 --> 01:21:53,169
Okay.

1118
01:21:53,256 --> 01:21:56,476
"Nos obsecro in auditorium.

1119
01:21:56,563 --> 01:22:00,219
"Rogamus autem satanas
iungere nobis ad mensam."

1120
01:22:00,306 --> 01:22:04,223
What if Jackson's not in there?

1121
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:05,877
"Nos obsecro
in auditorium..."

1122
01:22:05,964 --> 01:22:08,880
He'll be in there.
Just focus on her.

1123
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:11,317
"...iungere nobis ad mensam."

1124
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:13,667
"Satanas animas..."

1125
01:22:13,754 --> 01:22:15,452
Wretched thing.

1126
01:22:17,845 --> 01:22:21,284
It's working.

1127
01:22:21,371 --> 01:22:24,461
It's working.

1128
01:22:24,548 --> 01:22:25,941
It's working.

1129
01:22:26,028 --> 01:22:28,944
"Satanas animas

1130
01:22:29,031 --> 01:22:31,729
"tibi offerimus pro vase.

1131
01:22:31,816 --> 01:22:35,167
"Veni nobis, accipe solio tuo.

1132
01:22:35,254 --> 01:22:36,690
"Nos obsecro in auditorium..."

1133
01:22:36,777 --> 01:22:37,691
Henry...

1134
01:22:37,778 --> 01:22:39,911
Say it.

1135
01:22:39,998 --> 01:22:41,565
I've been trying
to get a hold of you.

1136
01:22:41,652 --> 01:22:42,566
What's wrong?

1137
01:22:42,653 --> 01:22:43,784
It's Ian.

1138
01:22:43,871 --> 01:22:46,309
He fucking snapped, man.

1139
01:22:46,396 --> 01:22:48,224
He killed his mother last night,

1140
01:22:48,311 --> 01:22:49,921
drew a bunch of fucking
symbols on the wall.

1141
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:51,575
The police are
asking me about the church.

1142
01:22:51,662 --> 01:22:53,185
I don't even believe
in this shit, you know?

1143
01:22:53,272 --> 01:22:55,579
Henry?

1144
01:22:59,322 --> 01:23:01,280
Hello?

1145
01:23:01,367 --> 01:23:02,803
Henry!

1146
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:04,457
Fuck.

1147
01:23:08,896 --> 01:23:11,899
Something's wrong with Ian.

1148
01:23:13,814 --> 01:23:15,773
Just don't say anything.

1149
01:23:56,379 --> 01:23:58,294
Everything all right, Henry?

1150
01:23:58,381 --> 01:24:01,949
Fine. Just, uh...
Just keep going.

1151
01:24:04,778 --> 01:24:07,912
"Nos obsecro in auditorium.

1152
01:24:07,999 --> 01:24:11,307
"Rogamus autem satanas esum.

1153
01:24:11,394 --> 01:24:13,439
"Iungere nobis

1154
01:24:13,526 --> 01:24:16,573
"requium ad mensam.

1155
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:19,445
"Satanas iungere nobis tibi..."

1156
01:24:19,532 --> 01:24:21,708
- Ian?
- "...offerimus pro vase."

1157
01:24:21,795 --> 01:24:23,797
How do we know
when Jackson's inside?

1158
01:24:23,884 --> 01:24:25,712
"Veni nobis..."
When it's finished!

1159
01:24:25,799 --> 01:24:27,758
You want to see
your fucking grandson?

1160
01:24:27,845 --> 01:24:30,456
Shut up! I know what
I'm fucking doing!

1161
01:24:30,543 --> 01:24:31,501
"Solio tuo..."

1162
01:24:31,588 --> 01:24:32,937
Ahh! Ahh!

1163
01:24:33,024 --> 01:24:35,331
Don't hurt her!

1164
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:37,028
- Henry...
- Undo my legs.

1165
01:24:37,115 --> 01:24:38,812
Don't.

1166
01:24:38,899 --> 01:24:40,727
No! Don't do it.
Henry, please don't do it.

1167
01:24:40,814 --> 01:24:42,990
Undo my legs or, I swear,
I'll cut her throat!

1168
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,514
No! No!

1169
01:24:44,601 --> 01:24:46,559
"Satanas..." don't! Don't! Don't!

1170
01:24:46,646 --> 01:24:48,561
Give me the keys!
Give me the keys!

1171
01:24:48,648 --> 01:24:49,954
No!

1172
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:52,391
I know you won't
let me hurt her. Do it!

1173
01:24:52,478 --> 01:24:54,959
"Veni nobis, accipe..."

1174
01:24:55,046 --> 01:24:56,526
- Give to me!
- Don't fucking do it!

1175
01:24:56,613 --> 01:24:57,744
Henry, don't do it.

1176
01:24:57,831 --> 01:25:00,095
You dumb fucking shit!

1177
01:25:02,749 --> 01:25:04,490
We need her! Okay?!

1178
01:25:04,577 --> 01:25:07,014
This is bigger than your
stupid fucking bitch wife!

1179
01:25:13,847 --> 01:25:16,067
No! No!

1180
01:25:16,154 --> 01:25:18,374
Ahh!

1181
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:20,027
Henry...

1182
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:21,725
Fucking idiot.

1183
01:25:21,812 --> 01:25:23,509
You fucking idiot.

1184
01:25:23,596 --> 01:25:25,076
Ian, please, I just
want my Jackson back, please.

1185
01:25:25,163 --> 01:25:27,905
I just want my Jackson.

1186
01:25:27,992 --> 01:25:30,560
Oh!

1187
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:38,916
Mother's a mother.

1188
01:25:39,003 --> 01:25:41,484
Henry...

1189
01:25:56,499 --> 01:26:00,590
It's all right.
It's okay.

1190
01:26:03,201 --> 01:26:04,942
What are you doing?

1191
01:26:05,029 --> 01:26:06,857
Stop! It's okay.

1192
01:26:06,944 --> 01:26:08,163
I'm giving him a home!

1193
01:26:12,776 --> 01:26:15,039
Take whichever one you want!

1194
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:21,959
Cleanse the earth
of these fucking sheep!

1195
01:26:31,708 --> 01:26:35,102
Vas, tuum est!

1196
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,582
I'm cold.

1197
01:26:36,669 --> 01:26:38,193
Take mulieri!

1198
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:43,110
Just need a blanket.

1199
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:47,941
Veni nobis Vanth!

1200
01:26:56,036 --> 01:26:58,604
I love you, Audrey.

1201
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:03,174
He's coming.

1202
01:27:03,261 --> 01:27:05,611
He's coming!

1203
01:27:05,698 --> 01:27:07,744
And you,

1204
01:27:07,831 --> 01:27:10,225
you can't fucking stop him!

1205
01:27:12,052 --> 01:27:13,184
Ahh! Fuck!

1206
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:14,838
Fucking bitch!

1207
01:27:16,318 --> 01:27:19,712
Shh...

1208
01:27:21,845 --> 01:27:24,021
Henry! Henry!

1209
01:27:24,108 --> 01:27:26,980
Henry! Henry! Henry!

1210
01:27:27,067 --> 01:27:29,026
Get him off me!

1211
01:27:29,113 --> 01:27:30,897
Help me!

1212
01:27:30,984 --> 01:27:34,466
Audrey...

1213
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:51,875
Ahh! Ahh!

1214
01:28:12,765 --> 01:28:14,245
Go.

1215
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:19,598
Shannon... forgive us.

1216
01:28:24,995 --> 01:28:26,257
Audrey?

1217
01:28:26,344 --> 01:28:27,998
Dr. Walsh, come on!

1218
01:28:44,362 --> 01:28:47,800
Ahh...

1219
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:37,241
Trick or treat.

1220
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)
Miss Becker,

1221
01:30:56,363 --> 01:30:59,410
your safe now.

1222
01:30:59,497 --> 01:31:02,718
Come with me.

1223
01:31:02,805 --> 01:31:04,894
Miss Becker,
what are you running from?!

1224
01:31:04,981 --> 01:31:06,025
I can help you!

1225
01:31:44,324 --> 01:31:47,371
You gotta let me
see my kids, Jenny!

1226
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:50,766
How's this fair to me?!

1227
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Upcoming jump scare (Minor)

1228
01:32:11,134 --> 01:32:13,484
You're not taking my
motherfucking kids, Jenny!

1229
01:32:13,571 --> 01:32:15,791
You're the one that cheated!

1230
01:32:15,878 --> 01:32:17,532
You're the one
who ruined this family!
