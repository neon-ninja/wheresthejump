1
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,620
Beware of the Blob
It creeps and leaps

2
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:21,062
And glides and slides
across the floor

3
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:24,067
Right through the door
and all around the wall

4
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:28,435
A splotch, a blotch
Be careful of the Blob

5
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:30,872
Beware of the Blob
It creeps and leaps

6
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:33,274
And glides and slides
across the floor

7
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:36,245
Right through the door
and all around the wall

8
00:01:36,314 --> 00:01:39,977
A splotch, a blotch
Be careful of the Blob

9
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:43,282
Beware of the Blob
It creeps and leaps

10
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:45,845
And glides and slides
across the floor

11
00:01:45,923 --> 00:01:48,983
Right through the door
and all around the wall

12
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,188
A splotch, a blotch
Be careful of the Blob

13
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,714
No.

14
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:13,410
Well, it's a shooting star.

15
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:16,248
I thought you were supposed to
wish on shooting stars.

16
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,618
- But I did.
- We only saw one.

17
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:21,590
- But you see a lot of'em
up here at night.
- What?

18
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:24,594
Well, I mean, there's
a lot of'em out at night.

19
00:02:24,662 --> 00:02:27,597
You don't see 'em in town.
That's why I come up here.

20
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:29,929
Oh, no, that's not what I mean.

21
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:33,266
- I mean, you can see 'em
better up here--
- I know what you mean, Steve.

22
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:36,306
No, no, it's not
what you think, Janey girl.

23
00:02:36,374 --> 00:02:40,674
My name is Jane.
Just Jane.

24
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:49,517
For a little while, I thought
that "shooting star" business
wasn't just part of your line.

25
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,953
But it's not, Janey gir--

26
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:55,959
Jane, I've never brought
anyone up here before.

27
00:02:56,027 --> 00:02:57,961
Never?

28
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,199
Never.

29
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:11,606
Well, I may be crazy,
but... I believe you.

30
00:03:11,676 --> 00:03:14,144
Well, you're not crazy.

31
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:22,676
Boy, that was close!

32
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:25,483
Come on. I want to see
if I can find it.

33
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,430
Shut up.
Get back inside.

34
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:11,366
- Get back in there.

35
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,079
Huh. Huh.

36
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:16,658
I could've sworn it landed
just over this hill.

37
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:20,493
Maybe it's like lightning. Sometimes
you think it's striking right next door,

38
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:22,725
and it's really miles away.

39
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,769
No, I still think it's close by.

40
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:29,135
Well, do you want to go back
and try the other road?

41
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:35,378
No. Um... um...

42
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:39,212
well, I'm sorry
about the bumpy ride.

43
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:42,650
It's all right, Steve.

44
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,554
Well, listen, why don't we
go back to town and I'll apologize.

45
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:50,151
I'll apologize over a sandwich.
I mean, on me.

46
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:52,593
- Okay?
- Okay.

47
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:09,709
Steve, watch out!

48
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,842
- What was that?
- It looked like an old man.

49
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:22,085
Where'd he go?
Hey, you okay?

50
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:25,322
Oh! Take me to a doctor!

51
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:28,263
- What's the matter?
- I can't get it off!

52
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:31,301
- Well, here, let me try.
Maybe I can get it off.
- No! You can't!

53
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:35,169
Okay. Come on.
We'll get you in the car.

54
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:40,074
- Yeah, okay, get in.
- It hurts.

55
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:42,271
Take it easy, now.

56
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,080
Here, better put this on.
Take it easy.

57
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:52,088
We'll get you there as fast as we can.
Boy, I hope the doctor's in.

58
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:56,422
Mrs. Porter, Dr. Hallen.
I'm leaving now.

59
00:07:56,494 --> 00:08:00,089
Yes, I'll be back tomorrow
night, probably late.

60
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:03,258
No, I haven't
forgotten anything.

61
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:06,428
Ye-Yes, I'll be fine.

62
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:11,100
Look, Mrs. Porter, if you'll just keep
your eye on the house while I'm gone.

63
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:13,370
Thank you.
Good-bye.

64
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:26,320
- Come on!

65
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:39,169
- Hey, who's the cowboy?
- That's no cowboy.
That's Steve Andrews.

66
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:42,171
- What?
- Yeah, that's his container.
It's a real dog.

67
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,733
- Well, he can't do that to us.

68
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:11,359
Hey, Doc.
It's all right. Come on.

69
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:14,529
- Watch his hand.

70
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:17,699
Hey, Doc Hallen,
this man's been hurt.

71
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,936
Well, come on in.

72
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,945
- Wanna get the door?

73
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:36,058
In there.

74
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:42,899
What's the matter with him?

75
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:47,961
l-- I don't know.
He got something on his hand.

76
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:51,303
- What do you mean?
- Well, we ran into him
down on the Old North Road.

77
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,401
- Ran into him?
- No, Doc, we picked him up
out on the road.

78
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:57,845
He was screaming
about this thing on his hand.

79
00:09:57,915 --> 00:10:01,817
Let's take a look.
Take it easy, old-timer.

80
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:04,446
- What is it he's got on his hand?
- I don't know, Doc.

81
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,719
It was kind of like-- well,
a big blister on his fingers, you know?

82
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,419
- Easy, now. Easy.

83
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:14,225
How are we gonna help you
if you don't let us see it?

84
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:22,064
Doc! It's gotten bigger.
It was just on his hand before.

85
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:26,405
Cover him with this, please.
I've got to give him something.

86
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,744
Take it easy, old-timer.
Everything's gonna be all right.

87
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:35,751
- Steve, uh, you know who he is?
- Huh?

88
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:39,949
- Do you have any idea who he is?
- Oh, no, no.

89
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,761
All right, take it easy.

90
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:51,458
There we are.

91
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:55,037
- Steve.
- Huh?

92
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:57,630
Could you drive out
to the place you found him?

93
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,142
See if you can find somebody
that knows what happened.

94
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,269
Right. Right.

95
00:11:13,691 --> 00:11:15,625
- Steve?
- Yeah?

96
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:19,759
Would you turn out
the outside light when you go?

97
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,630
- I don't want to be disturbed.
- Sure, Doc. Sure.

98
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:58,326
What's up?

99
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,837
- Congratulations.
- Yeah? For what?

100
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:11,676
- "For what?" he says.
- Modest.

101
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:13,876
Mooch, quick, the crown.

102
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:25,754
Okay, I give up.

103
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,956
You just beat out
the champion, pal.

104
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:30,193
A little while ago
when you came into town.

105
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:33,293
Oh.

106
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,033
I get it. Well, thanks anyway,
but you can keep the crown.

107
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:40,076
No, no, no.
Wait a minute, Steve.

108
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:44,547
You just can't stop
being the champion like that.
You've gotta meet a challenger.

109
00:12:44,615 --> 00:12:47,277
- You mean you?
- Me?

110
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,252
Did I say anything
about a race, guys?

111
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,379
Huh?
Not a word.

112
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:55,755
All right, look, it's been a ball,
you know? But I gotta go.

113
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:59,318
Yeah... we know how you go.

114
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:03,264
We're just not so sure
you should drive around so fast.

115
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:07,633
Now look, I just don't have time
to prove anything tonight.
Do you understand?

116
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:10,503
Well, who's asking you
to prove anything?

117
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:13,737
We can beat this kiddie car
of yours going backwards.

118
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:16,006
Oh, that's a foregone transfusion.

119
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:24,044
- Okay.

120
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,487
Now you're talkin', king.

121
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:30,323
And we'll do it
just like you said.

122
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:39,363
- What did I say?
- Backwards.

123
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:43,668
- Huh?
- See if you could beat this
kiddie car going backwards.

124
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:49,869
- To the light.
- Okay. You say when.

125
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:52,575
Okay.

126
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,953
- When!

127
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:22,334
I told you.
I got to leave now.

128
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:26,845
Steve.

129
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:57,508
All right,
what's this all about?

130
00:14:57,581 --> 00:15:00,846
Hi, Dave.
Hey, what's up, huh?

131
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:04,376
I seem to be missing something.
What's going on?

132
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:07,855
We're just sitting here
waiting for the light.

133
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:11,520
Oh, you mean
that light down there.

134
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:14,897
Yeah.

135
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:18,560
And you do know you're
on the wrong side of the road?

136
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:25,106
I don't--

137
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:28,144
Would you think it was funny
if your father--

138
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:30,612
if Jane's father heard you were
booked for reckless driving?

139
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:34,276
Okay, don't bring the fathers into this.
I'll never do it again.

140
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,376
- Do what again?
- Huh?

141
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:39,013
Do what again?

142
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:43,557
What-Whatever you think
I'm doing, Dave.

143
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:46,926
Like driving
on the wrong side of the road?

144
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:50,057
Well... yeah, yeah.

145
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:54,660
Or maybe even
driving backwards?

146
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:56,672
Hey, Dave, that's an idea.

147
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,971
You know that 80 or 90 percent
of the accidents are front-end jobs.

148
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,910
You know, in Australia
they got airplanes...

149
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,914
with the seats
set in backwards...

150
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:07,917
so in case you get
a collision, they got...

151
00:16:07,985 --> 00:16:10,010
no concu--

152
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:13,818
No good, huh?

153
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:17,588
Okay... lock me up.

154
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:20,528
You mean, you were dri--

155
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:23,532
Why?

156
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,536
What am I gonna do with you kids?
You know I don't wanna haul you in.

157
00:16:27,604 --> 00:16:30,539
No more foolin' around,
Dave. No, I mean it.

158
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:35,442
l-- swe-- I promise.
Right, Jane? Huh?

159
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:37,639
- Right.
- See?

160
00:16:37,714 --> 00:16:41,741
- No more horseplay.
- No more horseplay, Dave.

161
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:45,549
- No, no more fooling around.
- Get outta here.

162
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,573
Here they come.

163
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:08,102
Hey, what happened?

164
00:17:08,178 --> 00:17:10,840
- Sergeant Bert?
- No, no, no. Dave.

165
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:13,678
- Oh, you're lucky it wasn't Bertsie.
- Yeah, you're not kidding.

166
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,980
- You don't know the half of it.
- What?

167
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:19,216
- Last night we seen Gig's car
parked in front of Nancy's.
- Listen to this.

168
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,757
So we decided we'd move it,
hide it on him.

169
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:24,953
So we're moving it down
the center of the street...

170
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:28,987
when along comes Sgt. Bert.

171
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:33,833
- So Mooch tells him we can't
get it started, you know?

172
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:39,171
He says, "I don't care. You're blocking
traffic. Move it out of the way."

173
00:17:39,242 --> 00:17:42,473
So then he gets out of the car,
comes over to us...

174
00:17:42,546 --> 00:17:45,174
and he's helping us move Gig's car.

175
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,912
Just then, Gig
comes out of the house...

176
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,888
and he's yelling,
"Who's stealing my car?"

177
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:55,857
- I thought Bertie would drop his teeth.
- I bet he did.

178
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:59,862
- If Gig didn't cover for us,
we would've been in trouble.

179
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,024
Yeah, you know, I'd sure hate
to cross Bertie again tonight.

180
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,625
Hey, what happened
with you and Dave?

181
00:18:05,702 --> 00:18:08,637
I got a lecture.
Promised to be a good boy.

182
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:13,165
You know, Dave's a good guy.
I think we have been steaming
him up a little too much.

183
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:16,508
There's about two inches of rubber
on the street outside Doc's house.

184
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,515
Hey, I almost forgot.
I gotta do something for the doc.

185
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:23,212
- What?
- I gotta go up
and check on some people.

186
00:18:23,286 --> 00:18:26,050
- You wanna come with me?
- Oh, no, man.
We're going to the flicks.

187
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:29,183
- At this time of night?
- Yeah, it's a midnight spook bit.

188
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:32,956
We got some rumors there'd be
some unprotected women in the balcony.

189
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,931
Well, listen, why don't you--
Come on, come with us.

190
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:38,866
You can go to the movies after.
It'll only take a half hour.

191
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:41,233
- Come on!
- It's okay with me.

192
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:44,762
- All right, man, lead the way.
- Okay.

193
00:19:12,302 --> 00:19:15,430
Groverton 4771 .

194
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,875
5296.

195
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:23,574
Hello.
Is Dr. Gilpen there?

196
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:25,615
Dr. Hallen.

197
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:28,082
Oh, he has?

198
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:31,052
No, no message.
Thanks. Good-bye.

199
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:56,645
Hello?

200
00:19:56,713 --> 00:20:00,149
Kate? Dr. Hallen.
I'm still at the office.

201
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:04,483
Something's come up.
I'll need your help right away.
No, you've got to come back.

202
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:07,751
There's a man here with some
sort of a parasite on his arm.

203
00:20:07,824 --> 00:20:11,157
It's assimilating his flesh
at a frightening speed.

204
00:20:11,228 --> 00:20:14,026
I may have to get ahead of it
and amputate.

205
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:19,000
No, l-- I don't know what it is
or where it came from.

206
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:22,630
Man, look at that, will you?

207
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:25,300
- What is it?
- Wow, I don't know.

208
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,639
Tony, look.

209
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:31,340
- Hey, what landed here?
- We must be getting close
to the front line.

210
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:34,042
Hey, why would anybody
leave a lantern here?

211
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:36,677
- I don't know.
- What is it, Steve?

212
00:20:36,753 --> 00:20:38,948
- It's hot.
- Watch it.

213
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:41,786
- A shooting star?
- Hey, we saw that too!

214
00:20:41,858 --> 00:20:44,326
A real big one,
like a skyrocket.

215
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:47,522
- Oh, yeah, about an hour ago.
- You think this is it?

216
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:50,498
- I don't know.
- Let me see.

217
00:20:52,636 --> 00:20:57,471
Wow, a real piece of sky.
Here, Mooch.

218
00:20:59,743 --> 00:21:04,043
You mean that this little pebble
has been out there hot-roddin'
around the universe?

219
00:21:04,114 --> 00:21:06,776
Probably big as the moon
when it started.

220
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,375
No kiddin'!
Let me see it, Mooch.

221
00:21:10,787 --> 00:21:13,415
And this is all
that's left?

222
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,822
Well, it's all that's here.

223
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:20,829
- I'll bet there is a house close by.

224
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:23,866
Doesn't sound like a house.
It sounds like a dog.

225
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:26,835
- Come on, Steve. Let's go look.
- Yeah, sure.

226
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:30,270
- Hey, wait a minute.

227
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:42,917
- Hey, there's a house.

228
00:21:54,364 --> 00:21:56,832
- Hey, real nice.
- You think anybody's here?

229
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,165
Hello? Hello? Doesn't look
like there's anybody here at all.

230
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:02,967
Hey, I can't see anything
but just that little dog.

231
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,303
Oh, Steve, open the door
and let him out.

232
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,309
Okay. Come on.

233
00:22:07,377 --> 00:22:09,402
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on. Come on.

234
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:11,709
- Come on, pal.
- Come on. Ohhh. Come on out.

235
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:14,682
- Doesn't look like anybody
was there at all.
- Come on.

236
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,276
I guess it's
the old man's dog.

237
00:22:17,354 --> 00:22:20,289
Don't you worry, baby.
You'll be all right.

238
00:22:20,357 --> 00:22:23,451
- Think this is the place?
- It sure looks like it.

239
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:28,122
This is a cozy spot. No neighbors,
no cars, no roads, no lights.

240
00:22:28,198 --> 00:22:31,759
Yeah, and no movies.
Come on, you guys, let's get outta here.

241
00:22:31,835 --> 00:22:35,430
- Let's go, Mooch.
- I guess there's nothing else
you can find out here, Steve.

242
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:37,598
No, no, I guess not.

243
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:41,804
Why don't you come with us to
the spooky show, huh? You'd like it.

244
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:45,678
- No, no thanks.
- Ah, you gotta stop takin'
everything so serious-like.

245
00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:47,979
Gotta live a little.
You gotta go, you know?

246
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:50,519
Yeah, Steve, you gotta
hang loose, like me.

247
00:22:50,587 --> 00:22:53,283
- Okay, sure, the spook show.
- Come on.

248
00:22:53,356 --> 00:22:55,654
- Let's go, you guys!
- Yeah, comin'.

249
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,494
- Steve?
- Yeah.

250
00:22:59,562 --> 00:23:03,157
- What about the dog?
- I don't know.

251
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:06,327
I mean, we can't just leave him here.
He'd starve to death.

252
00:23:06,403 --> 00:23:09,167
- Yeah, that's right.
- Couldn't we take him with us?

253
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:13,005
Sure. I guess that's the least we could
do for the old man. Come on, let's go.

254
00:23:25,755 --> 00:23:28,189
Oh, hello, Kate.
Thanks for coming back.

255
00:23:28,258 --> 00:23:30,852
It's okay.
What do you want me to do?

256
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:34,624
You better take his pulse. But don't
touch that material on his right hand.

257
00:23:34,698 --> 00:23:37,758
It absorbs flesh on contact,
like an acid.

258
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,032
Doctor, where is he?

259
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,374
What do you mean?

260
00:23:54,117 --> 00:23:56,312
Kate, stand still. Don't move.

261
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:59,549
It must have absorbed
the old man completely.

262
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:03,683
I don't know what this is, but it's got
to be killed before it gets any bigger.

263
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,252
- Oh, Doctor, I'm afraid.
- Try to stay as far away
from it as you can.

264
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,527
- Kate, be calm! Now do as I say.

265
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,502
Behind you.
The trichloroacetic acid.

266
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:27,643
- Throw it!
- Throw it?

267
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:31,153
Yes, but for heaven's sake,
don't get any of it on your hands.

268
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:43,259
Doctor, nothing will stop it.

269
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:47,599
A gun. In my den.
I've got to go for it, Kate.

270
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,332
Now try to stay
absolutely still.

271
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:53,672
- Don't go. Don't leave me.
- I'll be right back.

272
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:57,679
Doctor, come back!
Come back!

273
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,942
- Kate, what's the matter?

274
00:25:06,022 --> 00:25:09,014
Kate! Kate, what is it?
Kate!

275
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:28,376
Kate!

276
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:03,507
Listen, you stay there,
and I'll go in and tell the doc.

277
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,515
- It doesn't look
like there's anybody here.
- Yeah.

278
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:09,916
Well, maybe he took the old man
to the hospital. Anyway, I'll check.

279
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,920
Okay.

280
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:48,989
Listen, I'm gonna check in the garage
and see if the doc's car is there.

281
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:50,992
Oh, okay.

282
00:27:07,844 --> 00:27:10,972
Steve. Steve,
what's the matter?

283
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,745
- Steve, tell me what happened.

284
00:27:15,818 --> 00:27:18,048
- I can't.
- Well, what happened?

285
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:20,919
- It was so--
- Steve, what is it?

286
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,120
- It's got the doc. It's got--
- What's the matter with him?

287
00:27:25,194 --> 00:27:28,686
Just like the thing on the old man's
hand, only it was bigger.

288
00:27:28,765 --> 00:27:32,326
Then it was on his whole head, and then
in just a second he disappeared.

289
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:35,030
- He disappeared?
- He was all gone. He was all gone.

290
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:38,505
- You know, he just disappeared.
- Steve, what are you talking about?

291
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,943
I'm sorry.
Get in the car, Jane.

292
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:46,277
Well, what are you
gonna do, Steve?

293
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:49,045
We're gonna go to the police.
They'll know what to do.

294
00:28:00,496 --> 00:28:03,659
Well, we can get someone
over there tomorrow. Yeah.

295
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:06,668
- We'll have someone over there
first thing in the morning.
- Well, what's this?

296
00:28:06,736 --> 00:28:09,261
Hey, watch it, Dave.
Don't mix up the pieces.

297
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:12,968
Ritchie, you old buzzard.
I didn't know you were a chess player.

298
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:16,500
It's like I've been telling you, Dave.
You're not the only thinker around here.

299
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:18,774
It's nothing.
Just a hobby, you know?

300
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:22,807
Well, wait. Wait a minute.
I think this is interesting.
Who do you play with?

301
00:28:22,885 --> 00:28:28,289
Well, late at night when I'm here by
myself and things are pretty slow, l--

302
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:31,293
Well, you gotta do something.

303
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:34,592
You oughta take up chess.
Loosen up your gray matter a little.

304
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:37,462
I guess I'd better.
You'll have to teach me, Ritchie.

305
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:40,001
Sure, Dave.
Anytime.

306
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:42,333
Dave, Doc Hallen's
been killed.

307
00:28:42,405 --> 00:28:44,669
- Doc Hallen? What happened?
- You gotta come now!

308
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:47,175
Wait a minute, Steve.
Tell us what happened.

309
00:28:47,243 --> 00:28:50,007
I'm trying to tell you.
Now this thing, it killed the doc.

310
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,048
What was it?
Out with it, kid.

311
00:28:53,116 --> 00:28:55,346
Well, it's
kind of like a ma--

312
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:58,819
It's kind of like a mass that
keeps getting bigger and bigger.

313
00:28:58,888 --> 00:29:01,823
- Come on, Steve, make sense.
- I know, I know.

314
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:05,088
Look, Dave, you gotta see this thing
to believe what I'm telling you.

315
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:08,790
Maybe the thing you saw
was a... monster?

316
00:29:08,865 --> 00:29:11,857
Yeah, maybe it was.
I don't know.

317
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:14,767
Hold on, Jim.
Now, what is it, Steve?

318
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:18,364
A little while ago it was driving
backwards, and now it's monsters.

319
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:21,103
Look, he's not
making it up, Dave. Honest.

320
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:24,271
Dave, I'm not kidding.
Come on over to the doc's.
You can see it for yourself.

321
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:26,713
You're crazy if you go.
Can't you see it's a gag?

322
00:29:26,783 --> 00:29:31,015
He says Doc Hallen's dead, Jim.
We've got to check it out.

323
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:35,285
Let's go.
Ritchie, you mind the store.

324
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:37,986
Dave, listen--

325
00:30:19,302 --> 00:30:21,964
East Cornwall, Downingtown H.Q

326
00:30:28,144 --> 00:30:31,341
Downingtown, East Cornwall H.Q.

327
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:36,308
Q to K-2.

328
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:40,321
Do I read you right?
Q to K-2?

329
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:42,323
Roger.

330
00:30:45,228 --> 00:30:48,220
K-9 to KB-5.

331
00:30:59,575 --> 00:31:01,509
Shucks.

332
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:32,506
"This office will be closed
all day Saturday. Dr. Hallen."

333
00:31:49,725 --> 00:31:51,852
- Wait a minute.
- What's the matter?

334
00:31:51,928 --> 00:31:54,260
The thing might be in there
waiting for you.

335
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,663
- Well, we'll have to take
that chance, won't we?
- I'm not kidding.

336
00:31:57,733 --> 00:31:59,667
Dr. Hallen?

337
00:32:14,984 --> 00:32:17,179
Dr. Hallen?

338
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:24,186
Hmm. Seems to be
a short circuit in here.

339
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,524
You got your light?

340
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:39,301
[ Dave ]
Everything looks okay.

341
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:56,715
There. I think this
is the room I saw him in.

342
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:05,357
- It's locked.
- I'll see if I can find
a key that'll work.

343
00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:09,996
No, the key's already here.
It's been locked from the inside.

344
00:33:12,341 --> 00:33:15,276
Hello?
Who's in there?

345
00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:19,974
Better go around and see
if the window's unlocked.

346
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:22,984
If it isn't, break the glass,
come in and unlock the door.

347
00:33:23,052 --> 00:33:25,282
- All right.
- You're not gonna let him do that.

348
00:33:25,354 --> 00:33:28,949
Now, don't worry, Steve. Sergeant Bert
knows how to handle himself.

349
00:33:29,025 --> 00:33:31,960
And this is the only way
to get to the bottom of this.

350
00:33:32,028 --> 00:33:35,156
- I'll see if I can find the fuse box.
- Okay.

351
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:43,194
Steve, I wonder where
the little dog is.

352
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:45,206
Yeah.

353
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:48,209
What do you think
happened to him?

354
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,609
I don't know.

355
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,384
Well, that's more like it.

356
00:34:12,735 --> 00:34:15,465
This must have been
what blew the fuse.

357
00:34:18,074 --> 00:34:20,008
Jim?

358
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,379
Wait till you get a load
of this mess!

359
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,586
Ohh.

360
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:35,080
What about this, Steve?

361
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:37,717
I don't know, Dave.
But I know I saw the doc.

362
00:34:37,793 --> 00:34:40,762
All right, kid, cut the act.
What really happened here?

363
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,424
-I don't know.
-All of a sudden, your mind is a blank?

364
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:46,400
- No.
- Steve, are you sure this is the room?

365
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:48,869
Yes, I'm sure of it.

366
00:34:50,806 --> 00:34:53,366
This has been fired.

367
00:34:53,442 --> 00:34:56,605
But I haven't seen
any shot marks around anyplace.

368
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,273
Let me tell you
what happened, kid.

369
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:03,216
You and whoever else
was in on this thought you'd
put one over on the police.

370
00:35:03,285 --> 00:35:07,221
- So you break in here,
you mess the place up--
- Wait a minute, Jim.

371
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:10,224
The kids couldn't have done this.
You saw for yourself.

372
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:13,625
The window was locked from the inside,
and so was the door.

373
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:17,427
They rigged it with string. It's part
of their plan to make us look silly.

374
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,334
I think you're doing that
pretty well by yourself, Sergeant.

375
00:35:21,404 --> 00:35:24,771
Steve, was there
anybody else with you?

376
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,330
No.

377
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:30,072
How about when I stopped you
over on Morgan Street?

378
00:35:30,146 --> 00:35:33,138
Those kids had nothing
to do with this.

379
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:36,150
- Who were they?
- Why, it was Tony and Mooch.

380
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:39,187
Those kids? Well, there's
your answer right there!

381
00:35:39,255 --> 00:35:42,190
They're just the kind of kids
to pull a trick like this.

382
00:35:42,258 --> 00:35:46,160
- But this time they've gone too far.
- What goes on out here?

383
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:49,629
- Land's sakes!
- What are you doing here, Mrs. Porter?

384
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:53,759
Boy oh boy oh boy! Wait till Doctor
gets back and sees this!

385
00:35:53,836 --> 00:35:58,136
- Back from where?
- Lieutenant, was it burglars?

386
00:35:58,207 --> 00:36:01,176
We don't know yet.
Where is Dr. Hallen?

387
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:03,837
Johnsonville.
A medical convention.

388
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:06,746
You know, I told him this would
happen one of these days,

389
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:08,977
the way he leaves
everything unlocked.

390
00:36:09,051 --> 00:36:12,987
Of course, it was my fault too.
He asked me to keep an eye on the place.

391
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:16,149
But that's not true, Dave.
He never left.

392
00:36:16,225 --> 00:36:18,921
I don't think I've had the pleasure.

393
00:36:18,994 --> 00:36:20,962
This is Steve Andrews,
Mrs. Porter.

394
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,965
He seems to think the doctor
got into some trouble here tonight.

395
00:36:24,033 --> 00:36:27,491
No, sir! The doctor
don't know anything about this.

396
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,300
He called me
just before he left.

397
00:36:30,372 --> 00:36:35,173
He didn't leave. Look, Dave,
I'll bet his car is still in the garage.

398
00:36:35,244 --> 00:36:39,613
Might be. Doctor sometimes
goes in somebody else's car.

399
00:36:39,682 --> 00:36:42,742
Dr. Gilpen
from over in Groverton.

400
00:36:42,818 --> 00:36:45,378
-Jim, call Dr. Gilpen.
- Right.

401
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:50,916
- He won't be home.
-Just checking.

402
00:36:50,993 --> 00:36:54,588
Mrs. Porter, did you hear
any gunshots tonight?

403
00:36:54,663 --> 00:36:57,962
I sure did!
Tonight and every other night.

404
00:36:58,033 --> 00:37:01,298
The people downstairs have those
old movies on their television.

405
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,430
There's always
some shooting or screaming.

406
00:37:04,507 --> 00:37:08,034
Whoever this thief was, he didn't have
to tear up the place like this.

407
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,044
I feel terrible.

408
00:37:10,112 --> 00:37:13,343
Wait a minute, Mrs. Porter.
I don't want this touched.

409
00:37:13,415 --> 00:37:17,078
Well, I don't want the doctor
to come back tomorrow and find
the place like this.

410
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:20,452
- It's bad enough
the window's broke and all.
- But, Mrs. Porter--

411
00:37:20,523 --> 00:37:24,152
Now, you boys have your work
to do, and I have mine.

412
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:27,821
There's a criminal walking
around out there free as a bird.

413
00:37:27,897 --> 00:37:30,525
You go get him.
Let me clean up here.

414
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,533
Mrs. Porter,
you don't understand.

415
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:35,434
We may want to check here
for fingerprints later.

416
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,972
Dr. Gilpen's on his way
to Johnsonville.

417
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,974
Did he pick up Dr. Hallen?

418
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:43,910
I spoke with Mrs. Gilpen, and she said
that Dr. Hallen had called around 11:00,

419
00:37:43,979 --> 00:37:47,437
just after her husband left, but
she thought they were going together.

420
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:50,815
- Where can we reach them
in Johnsonville?
- I didn't ask her that.

421
00:37:50,886 --> 00:37:54,413
St.John's Hotel.
That's where the doctor usually stays.

422
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,721
Well, they should be there
in a couple of hours.

423
00:37:57,793 --> 00:38:00,956
We'll leave word to have him call us
when he checks in.

424
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,999
Can't I just dust
around the fingerprints?

425
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:06,967
Tomorrow.
Well, let's go, kids.

426
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:08,970
Dave, this is all wrong.

427
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:13,566
All right, kid, the show's over.
It was a cute act, but this time
it didn't work.

428
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:16,406
This locked door business
really hung you.

429
00:38:16,478 --> 00:38:19,413
If everything happened like
you said, where's the doctor?

430
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:22,780
And where is this old man?
And where is the big, bad monster?

431
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:24,785
I don't know.

432
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:32,518
Hand me that small
hammer, will ya?

433
00:38:32,595 --> 00:38:36,588
- Why don't you finish that tomorrow?
- I ain't gonna be here.

434
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:41,030
I'm goin' on a huntin' trip.

435
00:38:41,103 --> 00:38:43,537
I didn't know you was a hunter.

436
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:45,540
Neither did I.

437
00:38:45,608 --> 00:38:49,408
We got a little cabin
up in the south woods, the boys and me.

438
00:38:49,478 --> 00:38:53,414
And I'm tellin' you, Marty boy,
we're goin' up there this weekend,

439
00:38:53,482 --> 00:38:57,748
and I'm gonna get so roarin',
stinkin', no-good drunk...

440
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,186
I won't be able to see.

441
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:03,555
Hey, why don't you come with us?
It'll do you some good.

442
00:39:05,027 --> 00:39:07,962
Oh, I don't think Martha
would figure it that way.

443
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:12,967
Do you have to tell your old woman
everything? Tell her your uncle died.

444
00:39:13,035 --> 00:39:17,301
Tell her you're going away so you
can love her more when you get back.

445
00:39:17,373 --> 00:39:19,307
Good night.

446
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:23,607
Boy, I'm so tired of lookin'
at the guts of secondhand cars...

447
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:26,239
I could spit grease.

448
00:39:26,315 --> 00:39:31,184
You know, Marty, if I didn't get away
once in a while, I'd blow a gasket.

449
00:39:31,253 --> 00:39:34,745
- When I come in on Monday,

450
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:38,486
if Mr.Johnson looks at me
funny just once--

451
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,394
just once-- you know what
I'm gonna do to him, Marty?

452
00:39:44,933 --> 00:39:48,096
Hey, Marty!

453
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:54,299
- Look, you keep telling me
about a monster.

454
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:57,368
- All I want to do
is clear this thing up.
- All right, I agree.

455
00:39:57,446 --> 00:40:00,609
- But I still don't see why
you had to call our folks.
- Dave, it's for you.

456
00:40:00,683 --> 00:40:03,777
- What else could I do?
- Well, give us a chance
to find out what happened.

457
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:07,185
You know we didn't tear up Doc's house.
How long have you known me?

458
00:40:07,256 --> 00:40:11,556
All right, I believe you!
But I still don't think you're
telling me all you know.

459
00:40:11,627 --> 00:40:14,926
- Oh, Dave.
- Hello? Yeah.

460
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:18,228
Well, young lady, do you mind telling me
where you've been spending the evening?

461
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,201
- Daddy, it's all right.
- Oh, yes, everything's fine.

462
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,205
I always stop by the police station
to pick up my daughter.

463
00:40:24,273 --> 00:40:26,366
Don't you realize
what this could do to me?

464
00:40:26,442 --> 00:40:29,434
- By morning, it will be all over town.

465
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:32,241
We were just
trying to warn people.

466
00:40:32,314 --> 00:40:35,306
After all, I am principal
of the high school.

467
00:40:35,384 --> 00:40:38,820
Young man, this is the last time you're
ever going to take my daughter out!

468
00:40:38,887 --> 00:40:41,583
Steve didn't
do anything wrong!

469
00:40:41,657 --> 00:40:44,990
Mr. Andrews, can you make anything
out of all this? I can't.

470
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,655
Take it easy, Mr. Martin. We'll
straighten everything out. Hello, son.

471
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:51,996
- Dad, I saw something terrible tonight.
- And nobody'll believe us.

472
00:40:55,304 --> 00:40:57,829
Mr. Martin, Mr. Andrews,

473
00:40:57,906 --> 00:41:02,843
uh, apparently Doc Hallen's office
was broken into by vandals tonight.

474
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:06,677
And Steve and Jane
seem to know something about it.

475
00:41:06,749 --> 00:41:09,377
Vandals?
My daughter?

476
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:12,443
Well, you don't think our kids
were mixed up in it, do you?

477
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:16,582
All we know is that they
told us something had happened
over at Dr. Hallen's house.

478
00:41:16,658 --> 00:41:19,422
We're not accusing anyone
of what we found.

479
00:41:19,495 --> 00:41:23,329
We can't be more definite until
we contact Dr. Hallen in Johnsonville.

480
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:26,766
Dad, it isn't vandalism!
Dr. Hallen is dead,

481
00:41:26,835 --> 00:41:30,100
and he was killed
by some sort of a monster.

482
00:41:30,172 --> 00:41:32,367
Now, I know
because I saw it, Dad.

483
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:38,107
Lieutenant, I want you to know
that Steve is not in the habit
of telling lies.

484
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,549
If he says he's
not mixed up in this vandalism,
you can be sure it's the truth.

485
00:41:42,618 --> 00:41:44,984
Did you see this thing
too, Jane?

486
00:41:45,053 --> 00:41:46,987
Well...

487
00:41:51,527 --> 00:41:53,995
no, not exactly.

488
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:03,204
Well, look, folks, we'll
all know more in the morning
after we've called Johnsonville.

489
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:07,709
I think the best thing now is for all
of us to go home and get some sleep.

490
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:11,303
Maybe it's a good idea, son. We can
talk about this some more at home.

491
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,314
Sure, Pop.

492
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:18,546
Get out of the house as fast as you can.
I'll be over.

493
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,664
Maybe Bertie's right.

494
00:42:30,732 --> 00:42:35,669
Maybe this is just a gag
like those school fraternities
were throwing last year.

495
00:42:35,737 --> 00:42:40,174
Remember how they stitched that bathing
suit to the statue of General Hayes?

496
00:42:41,577 --> 00:42:44,102
I don't think this is a gag.

497
00:42:44,179 --> 00:42:47,512
Why didn't you
book the kids then?

498
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:52,111
Why make a big thing
of it tonight if we can clear
the whole thing up tomorrow?

499
00:42:52,187 --> 00:42:56,283
Boy, if it was Bertie, he'd have them
strung up by the thumbs by now.

500
00:42:56,358 --> 00:42:59,486
- Maybe he would.

501
00:43:02,431 --> 00:43:04,365
Police department.

502
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:06,731
Hold on. It's Bertie.

503
00:43:10,939 --> 00:43:12,873
- Hello?
- Dave?

504
00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:17,378
- Yep.
- A couple of people thought they
heard shots, but weren't sure.

505
00:43:17,446 --> 00:43:19,880
- Okay, Jim. Doc's place locked up?
- Yeah.

506
00:43:19,948 --> 00:43:22,712
- Check back in, then.
- Right.

507
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:25,753
We'll get the truth out of those
kids if it takes all night.

508
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:29,120
- I sent the kids home.
- Home? Are you crazy?

509
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:32,888
Jim, we'll take care of this
whole thing tomorrow.

510
00:43:32,961 --> 00:43:35,088
Yes, sir.
Is that all?

511
00:43:35,163 --> 00:43:37,427
Yes, that's all.

512
00:43:37,499 --> 00:43:40,127
Bertie got some idea
what this is?

513
00:43:40,202 --> 00:43:42,727
I don't care
what Bertie's ideas are!

514
00:43:42,804 --> 00:43:45,568
He acts like we're
still fighting the war.

515
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:48,872
Just because some kid
smacks into his wife on the turnpike...

516
00:43:48,944 --> 00:43:52,675
doesn't make it a crime
to be 17 years old!

517
00:43:54,816 --> 00:43:58,513
Okay, so I don't know what
the kids are up to tonight.

518
00:43:58,587 --> 00:44:02,580
But I'm not gonna throw them
into a cell like a couple of vagrants.

519
00:44:02,658 --> 00:44:05,149
We'll put this puzzle
together in the morning.

520
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:07,821
In the meantime, at least
we know where the kids are.

521
00:44:20,842 --> 00:44:24,073
- Hey, where are you going?
- Oh, shhh, Danny.

522
00:44:24,146 --> 00:44:27,013
- Shhh.
- Where are you going?

523
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:31,075
I've got something very important to do,
Danny, but it's got to be a secret.

524
00:44:31,153 --> 00:44:34,645
I won't tell anybody.
I'll go with you.

525
00:44:34,723 --> 00:44:37,851
No, honey,
I have to go by myself.

526
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:41,828
- Will you be back pretty soon?
- Well, I don't know.

527
00:44:41,897 --> 00:44:45,628
Aren't you afraid
to go out by yourself?

528
00:44:45,701 --> 00:44:47,862
Yes, I guess I am, Danny.

529
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:51,133
I'm not afraid.
I'll guard you.

530
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:54,073
Oh, no, Danny.
You've got a bigger job to do.

531
00:44:54,142 --> 00:44:56,474
You've got to stay here
and guard Mommy and Daddy.

532
00:44:56,545 --> 00:44:59,013
Oh, they don't need guarding.

533
00:44:59,081 --> 00:45:01,140
Oh, look, Danny,
go on to beddie.

534
00:45:01,216 --> 00:45:04,845
Look, if you go to bed, I might bring
you a little dog all your very own.

535
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,047
A dog! Honest?

536
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:09,249
Honest.
I cross my heart.

537
00:45:09,324 --> 00:45:12,259
- Oh, boy!
- Now go on up to bed.

538
00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:17,662
- What's his name?
- Oh, any name you want, Danny.

539
00:45:17,733 --> 00:45:19,667
Can I name him William?

540
00:45:19,735 --> 00:45:24,263
Oh, that's a fine name, Danny.
Now you better run on up to bed.

541
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:28,298
- Go on.
- Oh, I don't like William.

542
00:45:28,377 --> 00:45:31,369
You run on to bed, honey.

543
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:37,441
Steve? Steve?

544
00:45:43,425 --> 00:45:46,690
- Was he asleep?
- Yeah.

545
00:45:46,762 --> 00:45:49,356
Do you think he did something wrong?

546
00:45:49,431 --> 00:45:51,831
I don't know. I don't think so.

547
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,028
The police don't either,
or they wouldn't have sent him home.

548
00:45:55,103 --> 00:45:58,038
I felt that he was keeping
something from us.

549
00:45:58,106 --> 00:46:01,701
He did seem more willing to talk
when we were at the station.

550
00:46:01,777 --> 00:46:06,373
Well, I think tomorrow he might talk and
we'll be able to straighten this out.

551
00:46:06,448 --> 00:46:09,383
Maybe, after a good night's sleep.

552
00:46:09,451 --> 00:46:12,045
Yeah. Good night.

553
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,054
'Night, dear.

554
00:46:46,488 --> 00:46:49,423
You scared me to death.
What are you doing here?

555
00:46:49,491 --> 00:46:51,755
Listen, Jane, I told you
to wait over there.

556
00:46:51,827 --> 00:46:54,762
The folks went to bed, so I thought
I should just come on over.

557
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:57,162
All right, come on.
Let's go around the corner.

558
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,704
- Steve?
- Huh?

559
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:12,770
Oh, I'm sorry.

560
00:47:12,848 --> 00:47:16,784
- At least I could've thanked you
for coming out tonight.
- You didn't need to.

561
00:47:16,852 --> 00:47:20,447
I never needed to talk to anyone before,
not as much as I do now.

562
00:47:20,522 --> 00:47:23,855
Well, we're in this together,
aren't we, Steve?

563
00:47:25,627 --> 00:47:28,187
You know, I wish that we--

564
00:47:30,832 --> 00:47:35,030
I must be getting confused.

565
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:39,267
I know we saw the old man,
I know we took him to the doc's...

566
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:42,469
and I know the doc sent us out to see
if we could find out what happened.

567
00:47:42,544 --> 00:47:44,808
So?

568
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,815
And I know the old man
had something on his hand,

569
00:47:47,883 --> 00:47:51,148
something he couldn't get off,
something that kept getting larger.

570
00:47:51,219 --> 00:47:53,312
I saw that.

571
00:47:53,388 --> 00:47:57,825
And then l--
I think I saw the doc.

572
00:47:57,893 --> 00:48:01,226
He was standing
by the window, and he--

573
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:04,163
he was trying to get out...

574
00:48:04,232 --> 00:48:06,826
and that thing
was all over him...

575
00:48:06,902 --> 00:48:11,839
and then...just dissolved
while I stood there.

576
00:48:11,907 --> 00:48:14,876
I think I saw this.

577
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:17,275
I believe you did.

578
00:48:27,255 --> 00:48:31,191
You know, plenty of people
in their right mind thought they
saw things that didn't exist,

579
00:48:31,259 --> 00:48:33,352
you know,
like flying saucers.

580
00:48:33,428 --> 00:48:37,524
The light was just right,
and the angle and the imagination.

581
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,536
Boy, if that's what it is,
then this is just an ordinary night.

582
00:48:42,604 --> 00:48:46,472
You and I are gonna go to sleep,
and tomorrow when we get up...

583
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:50,477
that sun's gonna shine,
just like yesterday.

584
00:48:50,545 --> 00:48:52,536
Good old yesterday.

585
00:48:52,614 --> 00:48:57,483
Steve, well, you believe
you did see it, don't you?

586
00:48:57,552 --> 00:48:59,543
I don't know. l-l--

587
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:02,215
That's not true, Steve.

588
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:06,158
Well, maybe, maybe now
you don't want to believe it.

589
00:49:06,228 --> 00:49:09,823
Maybe you'd like to tell
yourself it didn't happen.

590
00:49:09,898 --> 00:49:13,425
But, Steve, you're not the kind
of person who can turn your back...

591
00:49:13,501 --> 00:49:17,232
on something
you know is true.

592
00:49:17,305 --> 00:49:19,239
I don't know.

593
00:49:19,307 --> 00:49:22,242
Well, you actually did see
what happened to Dr. Hallen.

594
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,244
How do you know I did?

595
00:49:24,312 --> 00:49:27,679
Because I know you.

596
00:49:35,023 --> 00:49:39,289
Okay.
Now what do we do?

597
00:49:39,361 --> 00:49:42,353
How do you get people to protect
themselves from something
they don't believe in?

598
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:46,230
Well, you keep trying
and hoping you can find...

599
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:49,702
some sort of proof
that'll convince them.

600
00:49:51,172 --> 00:49:53,106
Okay.

601
00:49:53,174 --> 00:49:55,267
I don't like it much,

602
00:49:55,343 --> 00:49:59,279
but I guess the only way you can find
that is to go out and look for it.

603
00:50:01,216 --> 00:50:03,275
I'll go get the car.

604
00:50:55,937 --> 00:50:58,872
- You sure you want to go with me?
- Yes.

605
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,340
I wouldn't give much
for our chances...

606
00:51:01,409 --> 00:51:04,344
wandering around in the middle
of the night trying to find something...

607
00:51:04,412 --> 00:51:06,846
that if we found it,
it might kill us.

608
00:51:06,915 --> 00:51:09,850
If we could only find
a couple of people to help us.

609
00:51:09,918 --> 00:51:12,182
Hmm. Who?

610
00:51:12,253 --> 00:51:15,950
Well, your friends,
Tony, Mooch and Al.

611
00:51:16,024 --> 00:51:19,187
Hey, you know, that--
that's worth a try.

612
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:32,328
Yes, I am here,

613
00:51:32,407 --> 00:51:36,673
the demon who
possesses your soul.

614
00:51:36,744 --> 00:51:41,374
Wait a bit.
I am coming for you.

615
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,114
I have so much to show you.

616
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:47,381
Tony, listen,
I wanna see you outside.

617
00:51:47,455 --> 00:51:50,356
Hey, what gives? I thought
you cats didn't dig spooky shows.

618
00:51:50,425 --> 00:51:52,359
This is important.
Outside.

619
00:51:52,427 --> 00:51:54,987
- Hey, what's up?
- Shhh.

620
00:51:55,063 --> 00:51:57,190
I'll explain outside.
This is important.

621
00:51:57,265 --> 00:52:00,928
You missed most of the picture.
You're not gonna get your money's worth.

622
00:52:01,002 --> 00:52:03,869
None of us are,
unless somebody keeps quiet.

623
00:52:03,938 --> 00:52:07,237
You're gotta come with us.
There's nobody else we can go to.

624
00:52:07,308 --> 00:52:10,471
- Okay, you kids, knock it off.
- Come on!

625
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:12,638
What?
Walk out of the movie?

626
00:52:12,714 --> 00:52:14,978
Let's cut out.
You cats gonna make it?

627
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:18,507
Not me. I'm part of this chair,
and I can't move.

628
00:52:18,586 --> 00:52:20,520
Tsk.

629
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:32,498
Hold up, Mooch!

630
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:37,197
Hey, all right, Steve, you made us waste
our 80 cents. Now, what gives?

631
00:52:37,271 --> 00:52:39,705
Yeah, what's the scoop?

632
00:52:39,774 --> 00:52:42,038
What's the big idea, Steve?

633
00:52:45,146 --> 00:52:49,606
Would you believe me if
I told you there was something
inside of that rock we found,

634
00:52:49,684 --> 00:52:52,209
something that could wipe out
this whole town?

635
00:52:54,622 --> 00:52:57,750
Knock it off!
Go ahead, Steve.

636
00:52:57,825 --> 00:53:01,727
I saw this thing
kill Dr. Hallen tonight.

637
00:53:01,796 --> 00:53:03,696
Kill Dr. Hallen?

638
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:06,529
- That's right.
- Well, what is it?

639
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:10,264
I don't know.
But one thing's for sure,

640
00:53:10,338 --> 00:53:13,569
if it can kill Dr. Hallen,
it can kill somebody else.

641
00:53:13,641 --> 00:53:16,201
What do you want us to do, Steve?

642
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:19,974
All right, we're gonna find this thing,
and we're gonna make people believe us.

643
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,517
Let's try Johnsonville
again, Ritchie.

644
00:53:25,586 --> 00:53:28,214
- Okay.
- I just saw a strange one.

645
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:30,223
What do you mean?

646
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:35,554
On my way back here, I ran into
Mr. Connors coming outta that bar...

647
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:38,565
in the building he owns
over on Second Street.

648
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:41,568
He'd just stopped in,
and there was nobody there.

649
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:43,570
Queerest thing
I've ever seen.

650
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:47,301
TV was playin' away. The cash register
was there with the money still in it.

651
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:51,402
Nobody around.
No bartender, nobody.

652
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:53,743
I'll look in there
on the way home.

653
00:53:53,815 --> 00:53:56,579
Forget it. The place
is all locked up now.

654
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:58,744
Why don't you go home
and get some shut-eye?

655
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,414
You can't run our shift
and yours too, you know?

656
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:06,051
Yeah, I know. I wish I knew
where those two doctors were, though.

657
00:54:06,127 --> 00:54:10,029
- Any luck, Ritchie?
- Nope, they're not there.

658
00:54:10,097 --> 00:54:12,588
Want me to call
the other hotels?

659
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:15,864
There's a lot of them
between here and Johnsonville.

660
00:54:15,937 --> 00:54:21,170
No. I guess you're right.
I guess there's nothing here
that won't wait till morning.

661
00:54:21,242 --> 00:54:24,939
Well, I'll see you guys.

662
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:27,344
- Good night.
- Good night.

663
00:54:34,555 --> 00:54:37,046
Well, hello, kids!
Come on in!

664
00:54:37,124 --> 00:54:39,592
You're just in time
for the fun.

665
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:42,754
- We came to warn you.
- Huh? How?

666
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:46,163
- We came here just to warn you--
- Oh, a warning!

667
00:54:46,234 --> 00:54:48,794
Well, that's fine.
I didn't know you cared.

668
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:51,668
Hey, folks!

669
00:54:51,739 --> 00:54:54,139
I want you
to meet Paul Revere,

670
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,301
and this is Mrs. Revere.

671
00:54:56,377 --> 00:55:00,313
They've come to give us a warning
about something important.

672
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:03,145
The British are coming!

673
00:55:33,481 --> 00:55:35,676
Excuse me.

674
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:40,278
We were just--
just looking for a monster.

675
00:55:40,354 --> 00:55:45,087
Monsters? You must've been talking
to that guy from Second Street.

676
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:49,687
Man, I don't know
what they're serving over there,
but it sure must be great stuff.

677
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:52,699
Listen, we're trying to tell you.
We don't wanna get served.

678
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:55,702
Look, I have monsters in here
all the time, so beat it.

679
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,761
We don't serve kids anyway.

680
00:55:59,674 --> 00:56:01,608
Where is he?

681
00:56:01,676 --> 00:56:04,702
Over there, in the doorway
of your dad's store.

682
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:13,219
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on. Hey!

683
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:17,553
That's funny.
The door's not locked.

684
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,718
Do you think it's
been open all night?

685
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:22,388
Well, I don't know.
This is Friday.

686
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:25,398
The store closes at 10:00, and
then old Mr. Weinermeyer sweeps up...

687
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:28,094
and then he collects
all the push carts.

688
00:56:28,169 --> 00:56:31,605
Huh. He works around for a couple
of hours before he locks up,

689
00:56:31,672 --> 00:56:35,301
but I'm sure he'd never
be this late, not--

690
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:45,418
Hey, Mr. Weinermeyer?

691
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:53,984
Hey, Mr. Weinermeyer,
where are you?

692
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,990
I'm gonna turn on the light.

693
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:07,168
- Steve, what is it?

694
00:57:10,411 --> 00:57:13,107
I don't know. Oh.

695
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,172
It's a broom and stuff
that Mr. Weinermeyer cleans up with.

696
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:18,650
It's spread all over the aisle.

697
00:57:26,427 --> 00:57:29,760
What's the matter? Jane!

698
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:01,490
Here. You all right?

699
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,496
Yes.

700
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:06,764
Steve!

701
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:33,185
Oh, Steve, our parents!

702
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:38,129
They think we're home in bed
asleep, sound and safe.

703
00:58:42,169 --> 00:58:46,868
- Steve, it's the little dog!

704
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:50,604
Now listen! Everything's gonna be
all right. Do you hear me? Now--

705
00:58:50,678 --> 00:58:53,545
It's gonna be all right.

706
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,994
-I don't know if we can stop that thing.

707
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:40,290
- The dog, Steve.
- Take it easy, Jane.

708
00:59:40,361 --> 00:59:43,558
- Oh, Steve, the little dog!
- Don't cry, Jane.

709
00:59:43,631 --> 00:59:46,532
There's nothing
we can do about it.

710
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:53,170
Now, Jane, just put this on.
It'll be all right.

711
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,368
Oh, Steve,
what are we gonna do?

712
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:02,281
I don't know.
That thing probably isn't far away.

713
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:05,318
We've gotta get out of here
before it comes back for us.

714
01:00:05,386 --> 01:00:08,321
Now, come on.
All right?

715
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:42,040
- There they are!
Hey, where you kids been?
- Hey, it's in there!

716
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:45,085
- You're kidding!
- I wish I were kidding. It's in there.

717
01:01:45,152 --> 01:01:48,121
- He got the little dog.
- Oh, you mean the old man's dog.

718
01:01:48,188 --> 01:01:51,282
- We just seen him
running down the street.
- Oh, Steve!

719
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:54,384
- What do we do now?
- We're gonna call the police.
They want evidence.

720
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:56,554
There's a phone at the corner!

721
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,394
- Hmm.
- Go on!

722
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,937
- You talk to him, Tony.
- Me? Why me?

723
01:02:05,005 --> 01:02:08,406
I'm supposed to be home asleep.
If they think I'm loose,
they'll never believe us.

724
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:11,239
Yeah, here's a dime.
Come on. Come on.

725
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:19,077
- Hey, what'll I say?
- Ask for Dave.

726
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:22,953
And you give it to him straight. You
tell him to get out to the store quick.

727
01:02:23,023 --> 01:02:26,186
Tell him to bring every
piece of hardware he can find
in the police station.

728
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:33,063
Hello. Police department.

729
01:02:34,635 --> 01:02:37,331
Is-- Who's this?

730
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,974
Arthur who?

731
01:02:48,949 --> 01:02:51,417
Is every kid in town
in on this?

732
01:02:51,485 --> 01:02:55,819
I don't know who this is,
but you're going to wish
you'd never thought of this.

733
01:02:55,889 --> 01:02:59,017
Hello? Hello?

734
01:02:59,093 --> 01:03:01,618
Big deal!
I'd like to take that dime--

735
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:03,629
- Bert?
- Yeah.

736
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:06,131
- Wouldn't you know it?

737
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:10,466
All right, we tried to do it
the right way, now we're gonna
wake this town up ourselves.

738
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:12,971
- Yeah, yeah, but how?
- Yeah, how?

739
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,974
Any way we can think of.

740
01:03:15,042 --> 01:03:19,979
We've got to stop being
a baby-sitting service and start
being a police department.

741
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:22,481
-Just kids, Jim.
-Just kids?

742
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:25,484
That's about he craziest
argument I've ever heard.

743
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:29,079
Every criminal in the world
was a kid once. What does it prove?

744
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:35,589
You know what I think?
I think they've got it in for me.

745
01:03:35,662 --> 01:03:37,994
- You?
- Yeah.

746
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:41,694
They've heard about my war record,
and it bugs them.

747
01:03:41,769 --> 01:03:44,829
They're trying to break me down,
see what makes me tick.

748
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:47,430
Anything they can try, they try.

749
01:03:47,508 --> 01:03:50,375
Aw, I don't think so, Jim.

750
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:58,377
- What the--
- Sounds like New Year's Eve.

751
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,659
Hello?

752
01:04:15,736 --> 01:04:18,500
I don't know either--
Lady?

753
01:04:18,572 --> 01:04:21,439
- Police department.

754
01:04:21,508 --> 01:04:24,534
Looks like everybody
in town's getting up.

755
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:32,112
What's going on here?
Why, that's an air raid!

756
01:04:32,186 --> 01:04:35,747
Pull yourself together.

757
01:04:35,823 --> 01:04:38,758
Oh, it's probably only--
No, maybe it's the real thing.

758
01:04:38,826 --> 01:04:43,229
It isn't a drill.
Where is my civil defense helmet?

759
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:47,233
Where is it?
Here we are.

760
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:50,793
Here we go.

761
01:04:53,173 --> 01:04:55,835
- Fire.
- Fire?

762
01:04:58,312 --> 01:05:00,906
This has never happened before.
What am I gonna wear?

763
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:13,455
Henry, Danny's gone!

764
01:05:13,527 --> 01:05:15,461
What?

765
01:05:15,529 --> 01:05:17,861
And Jane too!

766
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:26,332
- Calm down, Elizabeth.
- I looked in their rooms.
They're both gone!

767
01:05:26,406 --> 01:05:28,567
- Are you sure?
- Yes! Yes!

768
01:05:28,642 --> 01:05:30,940
Well, maybe they're down here.

769
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,944
Here's Danny.

770
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:38,814
Danny!

771
01:05:40,287 --> 01:05:42,517
What are you doing here?

772
01:05:42,589 --> 01:05:45,456
I'm guarding you.

773
01:05:45,526 --> 01:05:47,619
Guarding us?

774
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:50,754
Guarding us
against what, darling?

775
01:05:50,831 --> 01:05:53,265
I don't know.

776
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:56,097
Has everyone in this
fool town gone crazy?

777
01:05:56,170 --> 01:05:58,968
Danny, do you know
where Janey is?

778
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,234
She's just gone.

779
01:06:01,308 --> 01:06:03,833
I'm going to get to the bottom
of this right now.

780
01:06:03,911 --> 01:06:07,210
- Come, Elizabeth.

781
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,014
Hey, what's going on here?

782
01:06:16,089 --> 01:06:18,853
What's the matter?

783
01:06:18,926 --> 01:06:22,623
All right now, kill the ho--
Kill the horns!

784
01:06:22,696 --> 01:06:25,494
All right,
knock off the noise now!

785
01:06:28,101 --> 01:06:33,266
Listen to-- Listen to me!
Now listen to me, everybody!

786
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:38,039
This town is in danger.
Several people have been killed already.

787
01:06:38,111 --> 01:06:43,071
Now we had to make this noise so you'd
listen to us, so we could warn you.

788
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:46,415
If we're in trouble,
where are the police?

789
01:06:52,326 --> 01:06:56,786
You! Boy, this time
you've really hung yourself.

790
01:06:56,863 --> 01:07:01,562
Now look-- Now look, sarge, just give
me a chance to talk to them, that's all.

791
01:07:01,635 --> 01:07:04,365
I don't know what kind
of a game it is you're playing,

792
01:07:04,438 --> 01:07:07,032
but whatever it is
it's gonna stop right now!

793
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:09,507
Here comes Dave.

794
01:07:09,576 --> 01:07:11,771
What's going on here,
Jim? Steve!

795
01:07:11,845 --> 01:07:15,110
Dave, make 'em listen to me!
There is a monster!

796
01:07:15,182 --> 01:07:19,084
We saw it again in Dad's store.
Dave, it's bigger now.

797
01:07:19,152 --> 01:07:22,815
Your story's gotten
bigger now, kid.

798
01:07:22,889 --> 01:07:26,825
Dave, look at me!
Do I look like somebody who's
playing a practical joke?

799
01:07:26,893 --> 01:07:30,056
Am I laughing...
or am I scared stiff?

800
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:35,624
- What are you gonna do?
- He's telling the truth.

801
01:07:35,702 --> 01:07:38,899
Oh, wait a minute! It's one thing
to make a fool out of yourself,

802
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:42,237
but it's another thing to make a fool
out of the police department
and the town.

803
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:44,777
- He's right, Lieutenant.
- You've been wrong before.

804
01:07:44,845 --> 01:07:48,906
Maybe I have! But as long as I'm
in charge of this town's police force,

805
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,815
I'm gonna handle this thing
the way I see fit.

806
01:07:51,885 --> 01:07:55,753
And your job right now is to help me
restore some order around here.

807
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:57,756
Yes, sir.

808
01:07:57,824 --> 01:08:01,590
- Okay, everybody, quiet down a minute.

809
01:08:01,662 --> 01:08:03,926
Quiet down, please!

810
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:06,989
Listen, this is an emergency,

811
01:08:07,067 --> 01:08:09,627
and it can affect
every one of us.

812
01:08:09,703 --> 01:08:12,069
That's all I can
tell you right now.

813
01:08:12,139 --> 01:08:15,165
But we're trying to get
things under control.

814
01:08:15,242 --> 01:08:17,802
In order to do that, we have to
clear this area immediately.

815
01:08:17,878 --> 01:08:20,904
So please go home
and stay there.

816
01:08:20,981 --> 01:08:23,347
We'll keep in touch with you
through your radio station.

817
01:08:23,417 --> 01:08:27,114
Now, be careful pulling
your cars out of this area.

818
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:29,621
Go home slowly and quietly.

819
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:32,921
Just keep calm.
Everything's gonna be all right.

820
01:08:36,596 --> 01:08:40,088
- Anything I can do to help?
- Lieutenant, what's going on?

821
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:43,295
Ask your daughter, Mr. Martin.
She can tell you more than I can.

822
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:46,464
- Phil, can your boys give us
a hand clearing this area?
- Sure.

823
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,770
- Do you have any guns?
- A couple of'em.

824
01:08:48,842 --> 01:08:52,710
- Get 'em.
- Say, Dave, what is this thing?

825
01:08:52,779 --> 01:08:56,840
I don't know. But if it's in the
market, we'll all know in a few minutes.

826
01:08:56,917 --> 01:09:00,353
Now all the images of horror,

827
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:05,050
the demons of your mind
crowd in on you to destroy you.

828
01:10:19,566 --> 01:10:22,729
Phil, can you move your truck
over to the door...

829
01:10:22,803 --> 01:10:25,067
and shine your big light
into the market?

830
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:27,470
- Sure, Dave.
- All right.

831
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:29,509
What the--

832
01:10:29,576 --> 01:10:32,204
Hey, who's in the store?

833
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,771
Huh?

834
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:45,480
There's nobody in here
but us monsters.

835
01:10:53,033 --> 01:10:55,763
Dave, it's at the theater!

836
01:11:21,828 --> 01:11:24,023
Don't go in, Jim.
This won't do any good.

837
01:11:24,097 --> 01:11:26,827
It's the most horrible thing
I've ever seen in my life.

838
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:29,835
- So what is it?
- Come on, we've gotta clear this area.

839
01:11:29,903 --> 01:11:32,394
All right, step back!

840
01:11:32,472 --> 01:11:34,997
Everybody step back!

841
01:11:44,851 --> 01:11:47,285
Here it comes!

842
01:12:05,105 --> 01:12:07,699
Danny!

843
01:12:11,811 --> 01:12:13,972
No, Danny, wait!

844
01:12:15,315 --> 01:12:18,409
What goes?
What happened out there?

845
01:12:18,485 --> 01:12:20,544
Oh, I almost got it.

846
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:23,487
No, Danny! Danny, we can't stay here.
Come with me, Danny.

847
01:12:23,557 --> 01:12:26,856
Listen, it's too late.
Let's see if we can get out the back.

848
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:29,293
Wait a minute!
What's this?

849
01:12:31,698 --> 01:12:34,428
- What happened?
- It's all over us.

850
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:37,402
- What do you mean?
What's the matter?
- Take it easy!

851
01:12:39,506 --> 01:12:43,772
Jim, get the telephone company. Have
them connect you with the diner, fast.

852
01:12:43,843 --> 01:12:46,471
I'm not gonna stay here!

853
01:12:46,546 --> 01:12:49,743
Now, wait a minute!
You open that door, and we've had it!

854
01:12:49,816 --> 01:12:52,649
- You wanna die?
- What are we supposed to do?

855
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,898
- Hello? Yeah.
- Steve?

856
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:09,231
- That thing is all over us!
- Watch out!

857
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:11,770
I don't think it can be killed.

858
01:13:11,838 --> 01:13:13,772
- We've gotta try one more thing.
- Okay.

859
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,865
- Is everybody all right?
- Okay, but not for long.

860
01:13:15,942 --> 01:13:18,672
We can drop a power line on it.
Do you understand?

861
01:13:18,745 --> 01:13:22,408
There should be enough juice in
that line to burn the thing to a crisp.

862
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:25,315
Yeah, get everyone
down in the cellar.

863
01:13:25,385 --> 01:13:27,683
We'll do it
in 60 seconds, Steve.

864
01:13:27,754 --> 01:13:30,382
Cellar!

865
01:13:30,457 --> 01:13:32,789
Okay.

866
01:13:44,904 --> 01:13:47,236
Jim, here's a rifle.

867
01:13:47,307 --> 01:13:50,037
- Take the phone, Ritchie.
- All right.

868
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:53,045
Dave, this baby should do the trick.
It's all set to go.

869
01:13:53,113 --> 01:13:55,206
Try not to miss, Jim.

870
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:15,497
Okay, let's have those lights!

871
01:14:19,472 --> 01:14:22,908
- Fifteen seconds.

872
01:14:29,482 --> 01:14:33,919
It's quiet now.
I think the upstairs is clear.

873
01:14:33,987 --> 01:14:37,889
Good. Keep your ear
to that phone, Ritchie.

874
01:14:37,957 --> 01:14:39,891
Okay, Jim.

875
01:14:55,975 --> 01:14:57,909
It didn't work.

876
01:14:57,977 --> 01:15:01,242
Why don't you do something?
Do something!

877
01:15:01,314 --> 01:15:04,841
- Elizabeth.

878
01:15:08,088 --> 01:15:10,716
The diner's on fire.

879
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:13,156
Can't we put it out?

880
01:15:13,226 --> 01:15:15,751
Any suggestions how?

881
01:15:15,829 --> 01:15:21,699
Anyway, not enough oxygen in there
to keep a fire going for ten minutes.

882
01:15:27,907 --> 01:15:31,434
There's something burning.

883
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:45,485
- Listen, is there
any other way out of here?
- The windows.

884
01:15:59,672 --> 01:16:02,800
Hey, now you be quiet.
Shhh.

885
01:16:02,876 --> 01:16:07,006
- I'm not afraid.
- Well, I know you're not.

886
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:10,277
Hey, listen, Jane--

887
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:13,251
It'll be all right.

888
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:16,880
Honey, lay your head down
and try to go to sleep.

889
01:16:16,956 --> 01:16:20,255
Everything will be
all right, Danny.

890
01:17:01,434 --> 01:17:05,063
Hey, there's the fire!
I'll stop it!

891
01:17:10,677 --> 01:17:14,169
Wait a minute.
Let me have that a minute.

892
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:24,413
CO2! Hey, that's it!
It's cold!

893
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:28,586
That's why it didn't come in the ice box
after us. It can't stand cold.

894
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:41,700
- You got any more
of these things? Huh?
- [ Man ] No.

895
01:17:41,774 --> 01:17:46,006
This thing's running out.
The phone. Hey, Dave!

896
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:49,242
Hey, Dave! Hey, Da--
Anybody on the phone?

897
01:17:49,315 --> 01:17:52,216
Hey, Dave!
Dave, can you hear me?

898
01:17:52,285 --> 01:17:54,219
CO2!

899
01:17:54,287 --> 01:17:56,346
Dave!

900
01:17:56,422 --> 01:18:00,017
- What did he say?
- Al, what's up?

901
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:02,027
Shhh. Quiet.

902
01:18:02,095 --> 01:18:04,529
CO2?

903
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:08,055
Phil! Phil, do you got
any CO2 extinguishers?

904
01:18:08,134 --> 01:18:10,102
Not many.
Some soda acid.

905
01:18:10,169 --> 01:18:13,536
Well, get the CO2s out here and start
hitting around those cellar windows.

906
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,540
- What?
-Just do it, Phil!

907
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:19,169
And check these buildings for fire
extinguishers. But only the CO2 kind.

908
01:18:19,245 --> 01:18:22,043
- Bring back every one
you can get your hands on.
- All right. Okay.

909
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:25,175
Hey, maybe we can help.
Let's get some guys together.

910
01:18:25,251 --> 01:18:28,778
- Lieutenant, I know where
there are 20 extinguishers
- Good. Where?

911
01:18:28,855 --> 01:18:32,450
- At the high school.
Who can go with me?
- Hey, right here, Mr. Martin.

912
01:18:32,525 --> 01:18:35,050
Well, what are we
waiting for? Let's go.

913
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:38,586
Okay, let's go.
Over here, Mr. Martin.

914
01:18:44,971 --> 01:18:47,838
This thing's running out!

915
01:18:47,907 --> 01:18:51,035
Hey, Dave! Dave?

916
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:53,943
Dave, CO2 fire extinguishers!

917
01:18:54,013 --> 01:18:56,777
Dave, can you hear me?
CO2!

918
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:03,311
- Okay, come on.

919
01:19:03,389 --> 01:19:05,823
- Oh, it's locked.
- Of course it's locked.

920
01:19:05,892 --> 01:19:08,360
- Here comes Mr. Martin.
- Here comes the principal.

921
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:51,704
We could only find four or five
of these things, Dave.

922
01:19:51,771 --> 01:19:54,399
- How many of them do you need?
- A lot more than that.

923
01:19:54,474 --> 01:19:57,136
- Keep looking. It's all we can do.
- Okay.

924
01:19:59,879 --> 01:20:03,474
Dave, Colonel Spaulding
got me through to Washington.

925
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:06,814
They thought I was crazy at first,
but they're getting someone now.

926
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:10,185
Hey, here come the kids!

927
01:20:28,341 --> 01:20:32,801
Our power's still out, so we can't
do much in the way of refrigeration.

928
01:20:32,879 --> 01:20:37,179
We think we've got it under control,
but we won't rest easy
until it's frozen solid.

929
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:39,377
Now--

930
01:20:39,452 --> 01:20:44,014
No, it's too big for that,
and it's impossible to cut it.

931
01:20:45,491 --> 01:20:48,460
No, sir, a bomb would spread it
all over the country.

932
01:20:48,528 --> 01:20:52,555
Look, this thing has killed probably
40 or 50 people since last night.

933
01:20:52,632 --> 01:20:54,862
In a few hours, we're gonna have
the sun overhead.

934
01:20:58,304 --> 01:21:01,740
I think you should send us
the biggest transport plane you have...

935
01:21:01,808 --> 01:21:06,040
and take this thing up to the Arctic
or somewhere where it'll never thaw out.

936
01:21:21,127 --> 01:21:23,789
Oh, Daddy! Oh, Daddy!

937
01:21:23,863 --> 01:21:27,526
Let me see you, son.
Let me see my boy.

938
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:39,574
- Nice work, Steve. You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

939
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:42,079
Dave, listen, I wanna--

940
01:21:42,148 --> 01:21:45,015
Well, I wanna thank you
for getting us out of there.

941
01:21:45,084 --> 01:21:48,144
You know, for a while,
I didn't think we were gonna make it.

942
01:21:48,221 --> 01:21:51,588
- That makes two of us.
- What are they gonna do
with that thing, Dave?

943
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:55,821
Well, the Air Force
is sending a Globemaster in.
They're flying it to the Arctic.

944
01:21:55,895 --> 01:21:57,863
It's not dead, is it?

945
01:21:57,930 --> 01:21:59,989
No, it's not.

946
01:22:00,066 --> 01:22:03,399
-Just frozen.
- I don't think it can be killed.

947
01:22:03,469 --> 01:22:06,233
But at least
we've got it stopped.

948
01:22:06,305 --> 01:22:08,569
Yeah, as long as
the Arctic stays cold.
