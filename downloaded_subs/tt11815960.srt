1
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,853
-I, Anna Fedorova,

2
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:41,552
Head of Research
of MX23 Project,

3
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:44,076
have approved human tests
of the vaccine,

4
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:46,817
deliberately skipping
preliminary tests

5
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:48,864
and running animal tests.

6
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,127
Since I'm fully responsible

7
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:53,999
for the failure
of the vaccine MX23

8
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,265
and death of my associate,
Dr. Maxim Zotoff,

9
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:02,399
allowing him to volunteer
to run a human test on himself,

10
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,923
despite the absence
of preliminary testing,

11
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:08,449
the project is not ready
for any further human tests.

12
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:10,886
All research needs
to be revised,

13
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:14,803
and MX23 has to be
temporarily shut down.

14
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:21,331
-It won't make you...

15
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,551
feel any better.

16
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:28,686
-I should have run these tests
on myself.

17
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,951
But I was scared.

18
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:36,390
-You have no right
to put your life at risk.

19
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,525
I brought you here to run this

20
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:42,918
as best you could.

21
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:45,225
-I can't go on with.

22
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:47,531
And even if I did,

23
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:49,838
we'd have to start
from the beginning

24
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:52,101
and then run
the animal test first,

25
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,406
just as I told before.

26
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:56,061
-Our soldiers in Africa

27
00:03:56,192 --> 00:04:00,675
will very soon depend
on your vaccine.

28
00:04:00,805 --> 00:04:04,635
I'm sure you can learn
from your mistakes

29
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:07,551
and fix something right now,

30
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:10,075
before our deadline.

31
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:14,428
There will be no charges
pressed against you.

32
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:16,647
If you quit...

33
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,871
...then Zotoff died for nothing.

34
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:30,574
-I'll take care of his family.

35
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:34,448
-What about the families
of the other test subjects?

36
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:37,407
Will you take care of them, too?

37
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,888
-Enough of this.

38
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,585
Remember...

39
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:44,457
the ends justify the means.

40
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:47,417
And, if you succeed,

41
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:50,290
you'll justify everything
that happened here.

42
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:41,341
I'd like to raise a glass
to our beautiful guest

43
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:42,820
and her great talent.

44
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:44,648
Can't figure out
how you to managed

45
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,563
to succeed
in making this vaccine

46
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:48,870
in such a short time.

47
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,742
You're a true genius.

48
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:55,529
-Happy New Year's.
-Happy New Year's.

49
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,357
-Happy New Year!
-Thank you.

50
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:58,445
-You're welcome.

51
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:01,099
-We're gonna miss the speech.

52
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:31,303
-Could you get that?

53
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,349
-Mm-hmm.

54
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:48,408
-There's a man on the phone.
It's for you.

55
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,499
-Will you excuse me
for a second?

56
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:07,949
Hello?

57
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,255
-Happy New Year.

58
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,780
-How did you find me?

59
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,869
-Let's get to business.

60
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:17,306
There's been an incident
at the secret research station

61
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,526
at Kola Superdeep.

62
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:22,398
Sounds of unknown origin
were recorded

63
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:24,705
12,000 meters
below the surface.

64
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:28,665
After that,
20 people went missing.

65
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,537
It's been decided
to shut down the station

66
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,016
within 24 hours,

67
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:34,236
before any further
investigation.

68
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,804
-Under the surface?

69
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:39,284
What kind of station is that?

70
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:43,419
-Officially, the deepest
borehole in the world.

71
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,378
Unofficially,
it's a secret research lab

72
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:50,687
located
12 kilometers underground.

73
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:53,429
But let's keep that between us.

74
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,736
-Sounds impressive.

75
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:58,652
What does it have to do with me?

76
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:01,263
-Its Head of Research,
Grigoriev, has been denounced

77
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:06,486
for hiding data on
a supposedly unknown disease.

78
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:09,358
We set off for Murmansk
in two hours.

79
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:12,274
-Wait a second.

80
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:13,884
-Anna!

81
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:23,285
-Rescue missions
are not my profile.

82
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:25,374
I need more men.

83
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,854
A team.

84
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:29,291
-I want these samples in my lab

85
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:33,034
before the station is
shut down and sealed up.

86
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:35,905
Let the WHO deal
with the rescue missions.

87
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:37,604
We go in, take samples,

88
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,431
and leave.

89
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:48,658
-How much the end
justifies the means now?

90
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:51,574
-You'll take all the credit
for this discovery.

91
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,402
And, in any case,
I'll put you in charge

92
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,884
of the Military Biological
Defense Institute.

93
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:02,237
-Alright.

94
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:06,720
[Wadsworth Mansion's
"Havin' Such A Good Time" plays]

95
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:19,689
Moving so carelessly

96
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,605
I can't believe
this is happening to me

97
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:25,173
The only way I want to be

98
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:27,828
I close my eyes
and can't wait to open them

99
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,570
I've got a world to win

100
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,268
Judy walks around
and looking so hazy

101
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:35,139
My baby just dips away

102
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:40,144
But I'm havin'
such a good time

103
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:44,758
Yes, I'm havin'
such a good time

104
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:46,760
Don't you know that I'm

105
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,982
Havin' such a good time

106
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:56,378
Havin' such a good time

107
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:59,511
The colors so beautiful,
the people so unusual

108
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:03,254
Or maybe you're dreaming

109
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:04,647
Of someone scheming
-Major!

110
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,693
-It don't really
matter to me

111
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:08,999
Yes,
I'm having such a good time

112
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,827
-Hey, how long?

113
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,829
-Seven minutes, Major!

114
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,877
-Havin' such a good time

115
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:01,095
-AK-47!

116
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:08,624
-Move!

117
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:21,506
-Stay back.

118
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:23,552
-Hey!

119
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:27,904
Fire.

120
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,127
-Friendly fire.

121
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:34,345
-Hold it.

122
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:35,999
-We got this.

123
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:42,092
-Holy shit!
He's alive.

124
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:43,746
-Stay where you are!

125
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:45,008
What the hell
is wrong with him?

126
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,488
-Don't hit our men.

127
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:48,316
Not another step.

128
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:49,578
-What's in his hand?

129
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,014
Put it down -- now!

130
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,712
-Grenade.
-He has a fucking grenade!

131
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,099
Go take a look at our people.

132
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,756
There's nothing to worry about.

133
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:38,627
Spilled milk.

134
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:25,979
-Can I help?

135
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:28,851
-You better not touch this,
Major.

136
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:39,601
-My name is Sergei MacKiev,
by the way.

137
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:46,303
-Anna Fedorova.

138
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,743
-Your accent --
it sounds familiar.

139
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,442
Estonia?

140
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:57,184
-I've seen worse, Major.

141
00:13:57,314 --> 00:13:59,664
There's no need to cheer me up.

142
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,463
-What the hell is going on?

143
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:21,512
-Lieutenant Colonel Terabuken.

144
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:23,819
Is everybody okay?

145
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,735
-Colonel Morozov,
Military Intelligence.

146
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,824
What happened to this one?

147
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:31,131
-This scientist came
from down there.

148
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,741
When he got to the surface,

149
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,483
he went out of control.

150
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:37,224
He managed to steal a grenade.

151
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:38,921
He was so strong

152
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:42,185
that the three of us
couldn't hold him down.

153
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,492
The rest of the staff is
being evacuated right now.

154
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:47,321
-I need to examine
people in the bus.

155
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:03,903
Fedorova.

156
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,863
Fedorova!

157
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,740
-Finish it already.

158
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:20,006
We've wasted
a fucking hour here.

159
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,095
How much longer?

160
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:24,097
-I'm almost done.

161
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:30,103
-They are all dead.

162
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:37,893
-Do you know anything
about a disease?

163
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:40,113
-It's not a disease.

164
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:45,770
They're lying.

165
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,123
-Zimin.

166
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:57,130
-Go back to your family
while you still have time.

167
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,480
It's hell down there.

168
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,699
That's what they found.

169
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,050
Hell.

170
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,877
-Fedorova.

171
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:14,930
-What do you think?

172
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:15,975
-I don't know yet.

173
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:17,280
But there is something here.

174
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:18,455
-Did we get the samples?

175
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:19,979
-So far, no.

176
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:22,285
Those from the bodies
seemed damaged.

177
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,330
-Alright.

178
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,593
-The miners look healthy.

179
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:27,682
The one with the scar...

180
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:30,206
something clearly scared him.

181
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:33,905
It may not be just a disease.
-

182
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,256
-Peter Akuznetsov, Deputy Head.

183
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:40,173
Currently, I am Head of Research
at Kola Superdeep.

184
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:43,785
-You wrote the letter
denouncing Grigoriev.

185
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:45,787
-Yeah, that's right.

186
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:48,094
I know the station.

187
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:50,792
This way leads
to the lower levels.

188
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:53,099
The car is ready.

189
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:55,405
-Mm-hmm.

190
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:58,017
Come along now, young man.

191
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,630
-Everything is just like
in a regular shaft,

192
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,153
but farther down,

193
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:06,589
you'll see what
we've actually created here.

194
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:10,071
-Lieutenant Colonel,
straight down.

195
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:11,900
Lieutenant Colonel,
just one thing.

196
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,250
Grigoriev insists that you two
speak before you go down --

197
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:16,252
something about the disease.

198
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,799
-Anything you might know
could help me neutralize

199
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,151
the source of the infection.

200
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:48,328
-In our profession,
there is nothing worse

201
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,896
than the betrayal
of our principles.

202
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:55,639
-What do you mean?

203
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,208
-The Hippocratic Oath, Anna.

204
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:02,342
-I have given it.

205
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:05,736
-Epidemiologists
never work alone.

206
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,264
You are here for something else.

207
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:14,093
And it's a cheap shot.

208
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:18,662
-Get to the point,
Comrade Grigoriev.

209
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:21,535
-I'll help you get
what you need quickly,

210
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:26,366
and you guarantee us
a safe evacuation

211
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:28,063
for all survivors.

212
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:31,284
-Why did you lock them
down there in the first place?

213
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:34,591
-Hmm.

214
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:38,595
It's never easy
to make that choice.

215
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:40,858
Have you made yours?

216
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:42,730
-Thanks.

217
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,473
But we'll manage.

218
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:49,171
-I completely changed

219
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:52,957
the elevator codes.

220
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:56,483
-How quickly can you recode?

221
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:59,355
-I'm afraid it'll take anywhere

222
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:02,880
from a few hours to a few days.

223
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:37,524
-The elevator will take us
down 6,000 meters,

224
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:40,744
where there is a residential
module for staff resort.

225
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,835
Research Module Sahara is
even deeper, 12,000 meters.

226
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,885
-Keep an eye on her.

227
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:53,931
-Yes, Colonel.

228
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:07,597
-Incorrect sequence.

229
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:09,033
Two attempts left.

230
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:11,558
-He really did change the codes.

231
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:13,212
-No tricks...

232
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:16,345
Comrade Grigoriev.

233
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,181
-Incorrect sequence.

234
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:28,444
One attempt left.

235
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:30,751
-I really have a hard time

236
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:34,102
working at gunpoint.

237
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,409
I get it wrong three times,

238
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,977
and the elevator falls down.

239
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:43,024
Just a little security measure.

240
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:54,514
-Access granted.

241
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:56,820
Initiating launch sequence.

242
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:59,475
-We have 20 seconds from now.

243
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:16,275
-I always wanted to know
what the difference is

244
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:21,889
between a microbiologist
and an epidemiologist.

245
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,849
-Microbiologists
study life forms.

246
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,547
-You?

247
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:29,810
-And I study how they die.

248
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:18,206
-
Is it normal?

249
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,860
-Yeah.

250
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,384
That's why we drilled here,

251
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:26,606
abnormally wide layer
of permafrost.

252
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:31,306
It reduced work
by almost a year.

253
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:33,526
Lucky for us.

254
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:03,120
-We are in trouble!

255
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:05,819
The reverse brakes are out.

256
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,388
-Hey!

257
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:40,304
-Anna!
-

258
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:42,350
You okay?

259
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:52,491
Do you hear me now?

260
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:05,025
Latvia, am I right?

261
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,042
-Grigoriev de-pressurized
the module

262
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:23,565
and stole the key.

263
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:25,349
The code was just a setup.

264
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:30,703
-Egorov, stay sharp.

265
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,577
-Oh, where are we now?

266
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:39,189
-Um...

267
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,669
here.

268
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,803
The main facility resort.

269
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:45,413
-Resort?

270
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,764
-Um, that's what
the locals call it.

271
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:50,679
They live here most of the time.

272
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,334
Sahara is, uh...

273
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:55,858
the main research facility.

274
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:57,556
It's even lower.

275
00:25:57,686 --> 00:26:00,210
The second elevator leads there,
but without the key,

276
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:01,908
we can't activate it.

277
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,780
-Egorov, do you copy?

278
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,913
-Loud and clear, Major.

279
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:09,480
-There is a second elevator.
You need to check it.

280
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,012
-Clear.

281
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:43,819
-It used to look
like a busy town.

282
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:54,221
-Anna, may I?

283
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:55,483
-Thank you.

284
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,528
I'm used to it.

285
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,182
-Hands up!

286
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:01,054
-Get back! Get back!

287
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:03,709
-Hands up!
Get your hands up!

288
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:11,499
-Clear.

289
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:21,509
-Happy New Year, guys.

290
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,251
-That's Kira, our doctor.

291
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:26,514
-How can I help you?

292
00:27:28,385 --> 00:27:30,474
-Are you alone here?

293
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:31,998
-We're the last shift.

294
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:33,608
We're still waiting
to be evacuated.

295
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:35,262
-Where is Grigoriev?

296
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:38,526
-He ordered us to stay here
and wait for his return.

297
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,398
-Listen,
with or without Grigoriev,

298
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:43,662
our shift has been over
for a while.

299
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:45,402
-Who is this?

300
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:48,275
-This is Nikolay, our engineer,

301
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:51,757
equipment repair,
and maintenance.

302
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:02,028
-I need to examine them both.

303
00:28:02,158 --> 00:28:06,249
-You do whatever you like,
but, uh, we're going way up.

304
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,338
What is yourproblem?

305
00:28:10,993 --> 00:28:12,734
-Calm down.
-Stop.

306
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:16,651
Please, I promise,
he'll do everything you say.

307
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:20,786
-You better listen to her,
asshole.

308
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,706
-Kira.

309
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:33,146
First,
I need to examine you both,

310
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:35,452
and then you will assist me.

311
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:43,286
Show me the lab, please.

312
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:45,201
-Sure.

313
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:56,473
-I told you already.
I don't know where Grigoriev is.

314
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:03,742
-I have a bad feeling
about this guy.

315
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,489
-Any weakness or nausea?

316
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,621
-No.

317
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,318
-Do you feel anything unusual?

318
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:18,408
Ever since you arrived.

319
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:23,979
-No signs of infection.

320
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,765
Kira and Nikolay seem clean.

321
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:29,376
We need a better source.

322
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,030
Get dressed.

323
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,339
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

324
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,558
Nothing useful for us here.

325
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:39,647
We can move on.

326
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,784
-Clear.

327
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,135
-So far, nothing. Over.

328
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:52,268
-Keep searching. Over.

329
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:55,794
-Yury Borisich,

330
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:58,274
looks like Grigoriev
has it all planned.

331
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:01,016
There are no samples
and no infected here.

332
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:03,540
How the hell are
we going to get out?

333
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:05,760
-We'll get everything
under control.

334
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:07,936
Mind your own business.

335
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:12,332
-Anna.

336
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:18,251
Anna.

337
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:22,472
Make them return to the surface.

338
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,474
I can't give you the key,

339
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:26,563
so walk up the shaft.

340
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:30,263
Save them while you still can.

341
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:33,222
-He's here!

342
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:36,617
-People should
always be a priority.

343
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:50,761
-You've got to be kidding me.

344
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:55,984
-Hands off.

345
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,211
-Open it.
-No, I can't do it.

346
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:06,865
-That's an order.

347
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:09,215
-Even if it was a decision
of the party,

348
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:11,130
I'm saying
it doesn't work that way.

349
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,654
When this elevator starts,
it doesn't stop.

350
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:16,309
You can't just stop it from here
until it goes all the way down.

351
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:19,442
She's gone. She's gone.
She's gone.

352
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:21,792
Come on.

353
00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:25,535
-He's not going anywhere.

354
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,624
I'll send my people
down the shaft.

355
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:30,192
We'll catch him there.
-Okay.

356
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:32,499
When the elevator stops,
get it back up.

357
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:34,849
Grigoriev might be dead
inside with the key.

358
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,896
If he's alive,
we don't have much time.

359
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:40,550
He went there
to hide the sentinels.

360
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:45,033
-Please stay close to me.

361
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:14,193
-This is a bad idea!

362
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:17,500
Grigoriev had it welded shut
for a reason.

363
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:30,339
-What is that?

364
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,428
-Latin.

365
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,128
It translates to
"insatiable hunger."

366
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:40,001
-What are you waiting for?

367
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:41,437
Suit up!

368
00:32:58,454 --> 00:33:02,197
-Fix your boots first.

369
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:05,896
-Why Sahara?

370
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:10,292
-Too many camels.

371
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:17,821
-It's 200 degrees down there.

372
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:24,437
-This suit
is our unique invention.

373
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,482
They're sealed

374
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:30,051
and can withstand up
to 300 degrees Celsius.

375
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:33,533
-200 degrees? That's --
that's great for cooking.

376
00:33:33,663 --> 00:33:36,014
I should have brought
some turkey with me.

377
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:38,929
It's perfect

378
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,019
for a New Year's after party.

379
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:43,586
What is this?

380
00:33:43,717 --> 00:33:45,197
-Don't get yourself fried

381
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:47,242
with the others.

382
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,469
What the --

383
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,079
What the hell are you doing?

384
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,647
The gate seals automatically
when the doors are open,

385
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,344
and I've got no protection.

386
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:03,519
-It wasn't me.

387
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,347
-So, who was it?

388
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:10,351
-Someone from outside.

389
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:13,007
-Get back now!

390
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,967
-Stay sharp.

391
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:00,750
-Egorov...

392
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:05,973
Egorov, help the civilian

393
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,454
and move down the shaft.

394
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:11,413
-Her name is Olga Kerlova,

395
00:35:11,544 --> 00:35:13,676
our junior lab assistant.

396
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:17,811
She worked at Sahara Lab.

397
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:23,643
-She walked all the way
up from Sahara,

398
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,688
through that heat.

399
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:45,665
-How did you get here
without a hazmat suit?

400
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,712
And what happened down there

401
00:35:49,843 --> 00:35:50,800
in the lab?

402
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:53,194
You don't remember either?

403
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,428
-She's burning.

404
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:26,314
You don't feel anything?

405
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:42,939
-I'm feel like there's
something wrong with me...

406
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,682
but it doesn't really hurt.

407
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:56,083
-Pass me the mask.

408
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,444
Hold still.

409
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:11,664
I'm gonna make a little cut.

410
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:37,559
Does it hurt?

411
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:45,524
-I'm just cold.

412
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:03,237
-It wasn't there 15 minutes ago.

413
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:05,457
It must be growing.

414
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:18,818
-We're still moving
through the shaft.

415
00:38:18,948 --> 00:38:20,820
It's all clear. Over.

416
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,604
-What does it look like?

417
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:24,519
Over.

418
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,522
-Just like Bigg Daddy's wife.
Over.

419
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:30,873
-It's dark and narrow,

420
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:32,658
and there's sand
dripping everywhere.

421
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:33,920
Over.

422
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:37,793
-Cut the bullshit. Over.

423
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:41,319
-So, what is your
professional opinion.

424
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:44,800
-I can't understand...

425
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,675
...how she survived with such...

426
00:38:51,677 --> 00:38:53,200
...tissue damage.

427
00:39:06,692 --> 00:39:09,608
It's a cellular parasite.

428
00:39:09,738 --> 00:39:11,653
-Is it the source?

429
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:13,438
-Yes.

430
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,316
-Egorov, do you copy?

431
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:30,890
-And this one looks like
a highly virulent form of mold.

432
00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:34,067
-What does that mean for us?

433
00:39:34,197 --> 00:39:37,418
-Comrade Major, there's...

434
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:39,725
something strange here.

435
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:43,032
Some kind of life. Over.

436
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:45,034
-Move slowly.

437
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:47,123
Report every 10 minutes.

438
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,995
-Yes, sir. Over.

439
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,746
-Listen.

440
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:05,577
Fungi and mold are the least
studied forms of life,

441
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:10,364
and this one
is unknown to science.

442
00:40:10,495 --> 00:40:11,887
-Great job.

443
00:40:12,018 --> 00:40:14,890
Let's get her packed.

444
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:17,197
Major, let's check
the progress of the elevator.

445
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:19,068
-Roger that, Colonel.

446
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:35,433
We'll need to pack her
in one of those suits,

447
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:37,347
just in case.

448
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:47,967
-Let's turn her over.

449
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:54,452
We can't do this alone.

450
00:40:54,582 --> 00:40:56,018
-I'll go get some help.

451
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:06,768
-No.

452
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:12,948
I'll go.

453
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,776
Wait for me outside.

454
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,737
-I don't know what to do.

455
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:21,696
I'm scared.
-Keep an eye on her.

456
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:44,893
-Egorov! Report, goddamn it.

457
00:41:47,635 --> 00:41:50,072
-I started the lift.

458
00:41:50,203 --> 00:41:53,728
It'll take about an hour
to get to our level.

459
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,086
-Olga?

460
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:49,044
-Egorov?

461
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:50,916
Egorov, report.

462
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:52,352
-There's no light.

463
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:53,614
I can't see shit.

464
00:42:53,745 --> 00:42:55,311
-Egorov!
-Fall back! Back!

465
00:42:55,442 --> 00:42:56,748
Fall back!

466
00:42:56,878 --> 00:42:59,489
-Egorov!

467
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:04,625
-I was hoping that you would
walk up back through the shaft.

468
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:08,586
I was wrong.

469
00:43:08,716 --> 00:43:10,544
-Oh, shit.
-Again.

470
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:11,980
-He's gonna blow up
the whole shaft.

471
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:14,592
-You've left me no choice.

472
00:43:14,722 --> 00:43:22,034
I guess we are all
staying here forever.

473
00:43:22,164 --> 00:43:26,691
And please forgive me
for what I've done.

474
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:28,562
-Anna...

475
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:30,433
-Although some of you

476
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:34,176
are guilty of worse.

477
00:43:41,053 --> 00:43:42,576
-Anna...

478
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:02,770
- No.

479
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,019
-Hey, you okay?

480
00:44:34,149 --> 00:44:35,107
I know.

481
00:44:35,237 --> 00:44:36,499
Could be better.

482
00:44:47,467 --> 00:44:49,164
Okay.

483
00:44:56,128 --> 00:44:58,913
The blast has damaged
the pressure pump.

484
00:44:59,044 --> 00:45:01,394
That's our facility in an hour.

485
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:03,744
We'll be smashed.

486
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:07,139
-Egorov!

487
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:09,358
Come in! Come in!

488
00:45:12,448 --> 00:45:14,581
The airlock seems undamaged.

489
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,149
We need to find Egorov.

490
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:19,020
-Oh, come on.

491
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:20,892
Are you really so afraid

492
00:45:21,022 --> 00:45:22,720
that your boys are gonna
get their asses beat

493
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,939
by a 60-year-old man?

494
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:28,769
-Finished?

495
00:45:33,643 --> 00:45:37,386
-I forgot he's already
fucked you up twice.

496
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:50,878
-Akieth.

497
00:45:51,009 --> 00:45:52,532
Enough.

498
00:45:59,278 --> 00:46:01,280
-We're moving through the shaft.

499
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,587
Be ready in 5 minutes.

500
00:46:04,718 --> 00:46:06,285
-Colonel.

501
00:46:06,415 --> 00:46:08,417
I want to send my people down...

502
00:46:08,548 --> 00:46:11,551
to get Egorov.

503
00:46:11,681 --> 00:46:14,293
-We are going up.

504
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:16,730
That's an order, Major.

505
00:46:21,953 --> 00:46:23,824
-I need some help
with the infected.

506
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,311
-I'll help.

507
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:39,100
I'm so sorry.

508
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:42,321
-It's okay.
No worries.

509
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:43,931
-You shouldn't worry.

510
00:46:44,062 --> 00:46:44,932
We'll get out of here,

511
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:45,890
all of us.

512
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,153
-You sure?

513
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:49,850
-Of course.

514
00:46:49,981 --> 00:46:52,722
I have orders, remember.

515
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:30,064
We have a situation
in the infirmary.

516
00:47:30,195 --> 00:47:32,806
Get over here now.

517
00:47:32,937 --> 00:47:34,416
Over.

518
00:48:39,525 --> 00:48:41,831
-Jesus, she's still alive.

519
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:44,530
Seen anything like that before?

520
00:48:47,837 --> 00:48:49,535
-Stay outside!

521
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:55,541
-It's Olga.

522
00:48:55,671 --> 00:48:59,153
She escaped.

523
00:48:59,284 --> 00:49:01,634
Let's get back.

524
00:49:08,858 --> 00:49:12,427
-We are in a contaminated area
without protection.

525
00:49:12,558 --> 00:49:14,212
-Samples, Anna.

526
00:49:34,406 --> 00:49:35,320
-Hurry up.

527
00:49:37,148 --> 00:49:39,498
-I'll help.
Hold the vial.

528
00:49:40,934 --> 00:49:43,502
Czechoslovakia?

529
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:45,765
Bulgaria?

530
00:49:52,424 --> 00:49:55,122
-Come on!

531
00:49:57,907 --> 00:50:00,649
-Don't open it.
We'll infect the whole facility.

532
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,999
-We'll figure something out.

533
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:07,020
-The nervous...
system dysfunctional,

534
00:51:07,151 --> 00:51:10,806
b-body temperature abnormal,

535
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:13,374
losing c-control of muscles.

536
00:51:13,505 --> 00:51:15,246
I'm so cold.

537
00:51:15,376 --> 00:51:18,510
I can't stop walking.

538
00:51:23,384 --> 00:51:25,125
- I...

539
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:27,214
can't get warm.

540
00:52:24,793 --> 00:52:25,968
-Aaah!

541
00:53:06,313 --> 00:53:11,579
-There is nothing worse than
the betrayal of our principles.

542
00:53:43,132 --> 00:53:45,265
-Wait a second.
Don't open.

543
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:51,053
Be ready on the count of five.

544
00:53:51,184 --> 00:53:54,840
One, two...

545
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:57,973
three, four, five!

546
00:53:58,104 --> 00:53:59,845
Open up!

547
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:04,676
Take it!

548
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:06,025
We need to clean my clothes!

549
00:54:06,155 --> 00:54:08,114
Quick!

550
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:12,249
-Turn around!

551
00:54:36,925 --> 00:54:38,840
Faster!

552
00:54:47,632 --> 00:54:49,111
-So...

553
00:54:49,242 --> 00:54:50,548
did you get the samples?

554
00:54:50,678 --> 00:54:53,725
-He needs a doctor,
for Christ's sake.

555
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,863
Kira...

556
00:55:01,994 --> 00:55:05,127
attacked me in the lab.

557
00:55:10,568 --> 00:55:13,135
I need to know
if you're infected.

558
00:55:13,266 --> 00:55:15,747
-Like it's...

559
00:55:15,877 --> 00:55:19,533
not clear already?

560
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,797
Huh?

561
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:29,761
-Anna, why did Kira attack you?

562
00:55:36,158 --> 00:55:38,552
-She wasn't controlling
her body.

563
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:42,991
-It might be similar
to Cordyceps.

564
00:55:43,122 --> 00:55:48,345
So, actually, there's nothing
supernatural about it.

565
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:57,484
-Tell me the whole story.

566
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:10,932
-The fungus forces ants

567
00:56:11,063 --> 00:56:13,718
to return to the nest.

568
00:56:13,848 --> 00:56:16,198
Then when it gets there,

569
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:20,377
it releases spores

570
00:56:20,507 --> 00:56:23,292
to infect...

571
00:56:23,423 --> 00:56:25,164
the others.

572
00:56:27,775 --> 00:56:31,997
-You know I got to stay here.

573
00:56:32,127 --> 00:56:34,956
You need to do the right thing

574
00:56:35,087 --> 00:56:39,526
and get everyone out of here.

575
00:56:39,657 --> 00:56:42,007
Only you can persuade him.

576
00:56:42,137 --> 00:56:45,140
-You're right.

577
00:56:45,271 --> 00:56:47,621
I'll do my best.

578
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:50,581
-I wish I'd met you

579
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:53,627
under different circumstances.

580
00:56:55,629 --> 00:56:59,024
-Thanks...

581
00:56:59,154 --> 00:57:01,287
for saving my life.

582
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:14,822
-That means...

583
00:57:14,953 --> 00:57:16,998
Olga...

584
00:57:17,129 --> 00:57:18,652
has returned to the nest?

585
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:39,456
-We need to talk.

586
00:57:47,812 --> 00:57:49,901
I figured it all out.

587
00:57:50,031 --> 00:57:54,122
Olga kept complaining
that she was cold.

588
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:57,778
I thought it was her reaction
to high body temperature.

589
00:57:57,909 --> 00:58:00,302
But, in fact,
the parasite was cold.

590
00:58:00,433 --> 00:58:02,043
That's his weak spot.

591
00:58:02,174 --> 00:58:03,741
Inside
of a warm-blooded carrier,

592
00:58:03,871 --> 00:58:05,830
it can survive everything.

593
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,921
But if a carrier dies
in a cold environment...

594
00:58:13,098 --> 00:58:15,448
...the parasite dies, too.

595
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:21,498
With hosts,
he's expanding his colony.

596
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:26,372
The permafrost will destroy it.

597
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,113
-Great.

598
00:58:31,072 --> 00:58:32,552
-Colonel.

599
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:38,166
-Any suggestions?

600
00:58:38,297 --> 00:58:41,430
-I would evacuate all survivors
from the resort,

601
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:43,607
call back your chorus group

602
00:58:43,737 --> 00:58:46,218
and send a proper
biological defense team

603
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:48,394
to evacuate Major.

604
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,048
I'll stay with him

605
00:58:50,178 --> 00:58:51,528
and try
to stabilize his condition

606
00:58:51,658 --> 00:58:53,399
until they arrive.

607
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,533
-There is no one coming.

608
00:58:56,663 --> 00:58:58,230
In five hours,

609
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,928
the station will be closed down

610
00:59:01,059 --> 00:59:03,627
for the time being.

611
00:59:03,757 --> 00:59:05,933
-Alright.

612
00:59:06,064 --> 00:59:08,414
I'm the one to blame
for this failure.

613
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:14,072
But there is no possible way
to bring those samples up.

614
00:59:14,202 --> 00:59:15,508
-Get yourself together.

615
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:18,424
-Kira...

616
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,905
and Olga would still be alive

617
00:59:21,035 --> 00:59:23,951
if I acted as a doctor.

618
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:29,653
The man who wanted to help me
is now a walking dead.

619
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:35,397
How many more people have to die
until we realize that we lost?

620
00:59:35,528 --> 00:59:37,878
This is not a war.

621
00:59:40,011 --> 00:59:42,361
-You're wrong.

622
00:59:42,491 --> 00:59:45,538
It is a war.

623
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:50,456
Our country is falling apart
as we speak.

624
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,981
We need a weapon that will make

625
00:59:54,112 --> 00:59:56,941
our military dominance
indisputable.

626
00:59:57,071 --> 00:59:59,204
If our country

627
00:59:59,334 --> 01:00:00,858
were to fall apart,

628
01:00:00,988 --> 01:00:05,645
then anyone who died for it

629
01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:08,126
died for nothing.

630
01:00:08,256 --> 01:00:10,781
If we fail now...

631
01:00:13,871 --> 01:00:17,222
...then all the people here
died for nothing.

632
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:25,752
-I think that this time,
you're not right.

633
01:00:29,147 --> 01:00:31,671
-Don't try to confuse me, Anna.

634
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:36,502
We have a live sample,

635
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:41,115
and he can walk all the way
up there in a hazmat suit.

636
01:00:41,246 --> 01:00:45,032
Help him make it to Moscow.

637
01:00:45,163 --> 01:00:48,775
-There are people up there.

638
01:00:48,906 --> 01:00:52,474
You'll bring him
right to the nest.

639
01:00:57,044 --> 01:00:58,524
-Just do it.

640
01:01:13,278 --> 01:01:14,758
-Thanks.

641
01:01:17,586 --> 01:01:18,675
-I had no choice.

642
01:01:18,805 --> 01:01:21,025
-No worries.

643
01:01:21,155 --> 01:01:23,854
You tried to do the right thing.

644
01:01:24,985 --> 01:01:26,683
Anna...

645
01:01:26,813 --> 01:01:29,555
can I really make it to Moscow?

646
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:40,348
I'll just assume you nodded.

647
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:49,967
Please make sure
nobody dies because of me.

648
01:01:50,097 --> 01:01:53,753
-Do you copy? Do you copy?
Can you hear me?

649
01:01:53,884 --> 01:01:56,843
-Egorov, do you copy?
Where are you?

650
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:01,892
We're falling back.

651
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:04,590
They're following us!

652
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,026
-What's going on?

653
01:02:06,157 --> 01:02:07,811
Egorov, report!
-Can you hear me?

654
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:09,987
Don't open the door!
Stay inside!

655
01:02:10,117 --> 01:02:12,990
Even if it's us outside,
I repeat, do not open the door!

656
01:02:21,563 --> 01:02:23,696
-Egorov?

657
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:26,655
Egorov!

658
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:28,092
We can help him.

659
01:02:28,222 --> 01:02:29,354
-Wait.

660
01:02:29,484 --> 01:02:32,096
He told us to say inside, right?

661
01:02:32,226 --> 01:02:34,402
-My men are out there.

662
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:37,318
I'm not leaving them behind.
Open the doors!

663
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:39,756
-Get yourselves together.

664
01:02:39,886 --> 01:02:40,800
-We can't help them.

665
01:02:40,931 --> 01:02:42,497
If they're dead, they're dead.

666
01:02:42,628 --> 01:02:43,934
We've got people who are alive
right here.

667
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:45,413
-You calm down.
-Open the door.

668
01:02:45,544 --> 01:02:47,502
You heard the man.
-Keep the door closed!

669
01:02:47,633 --> 01:02:49,548
-Don't fuckin' do it!
-Open that door!

670
01:02:49,678 --> 01:02:50,767
-Stop right there!
-Calm down!

671
01:02:50,897 --> 01:02:52,638
-Close the fucking door!

672
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,553
-No way I'm going out there.

673
01:02:54,683 --> 01:02:58,252
-Put the gun down!

674
01:03:00,472 --> 01:03:03,083
-We can't stay in the module.

675
01:03:03,214 --> 01:03:05,085
The longer we stay...

676
01:03:07,479 --> 01:03:10,395
...the lower our chances.

677
01:03:32,765 --> 01:03:34,114
-Major.

678
01:03:34,245 --> 01:03:36,334
We'll bring him back.

679
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:35,366
-We haveto close the doors.

680
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:36,410
-No!

681
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:38,238
We will wait!

682
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:41,024
-What?

683
01:05:41,154 --> 01:05:42,677
But wait for what?

684
01:05:42,808 --> 01:05:44,114
-Look!

685
01:05:48,988 --> 01:05:50,685
-What is it?

686
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:55,081
What is it?

687
01:05:55,212 --> 01:05:57,127
-It's Sergeant.

688
01:05:59,085 --> 01:06:00,652
-Is he alive?

689
01:06:00,782 --> 01:06:03,133
-Who were you shooting at?

690
01:06:03,263 --> 01:06:04,569
-I don't know.

691
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:06,005
Something big.

692
01:06:06,136 --> 01:06:08,138
Emptied the whole mag.

693
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:10,923
And the shaft is destroyed.

694
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:12,185
-Fuck, if the shaft is gone,

695
01:06:12,316 --> 01:06:13,491
and we don't have
the elevator key,

696
01:06:13,621 --> 01:06:15,536
then we are stuck in here.

697
01:06:17,886 --> 01:06:19,323
-He's alive.

698
01:07:17,816 --> 01:07:21,037
Light! Light! Light!

699
01:07:27,956 --> 01:07:30,872
Something attacked us in there.

700
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,792
You shouldn't have
opened the door.

701
01:07:37,923 --> 01:07:41,361
Now it knows where we are.

702
01:08:05,907 --> 01:08:07,822
-I wish I knew.

703
01:08:15,178 --> 01:08:17,049
-This way! This way!

704
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,269
Come on! Come on! Come on!

705
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:23,142
-Turn right!

706
01:08:23,273 --> 01:08:24,709
-Aaaaah!

707
01:08:35,502 --> 01:08:38,461
-We've got nowhere left to run.

708
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,902
-Get a barricade now!

709
01:08:53,085 --> 01:08:54,608
-It's inside.

710
01:08:54,738 --> 01:08:56,654
-Shh.

711
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:37,782
-But we don't have the key card.

712
01:09:37,912 --> 01:09:39,086
-Give me a minute.

713
01:09:39,218 --> 01:09:40,001
Alright.

714
01:09:58,063 --> 01:09:59,978
-Concentrate.

715
01:10:00,108 --> 01:10:02,546
-We're getting out of here,

716
01:10:02,675 --> 01:10:04,591
all of us.

717
01:10:04,722 --> 01:10:06,071
-No.

718
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,072
No.

719
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:08,378
It's...

720
01:10:08,508 --> 01:10:09,596
It's too late.

721
01:10:09,727 --> 01:10:12,077
I feel it inside me.

722
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,428
I'll hold the side here

723
01:10:15,559 --> 01:10:17,343
so you can come back.

724
01:10:17,474 --> 01:10:18,388
-Faster.

725
01:10:18,518 --> 01:10:20,912
-I'm gonna drop it down.

726
01:10:21,041 --> 01:10:22,130
I hope...

727
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:26,134
the emergency brakes will hold.

728
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:35,448
-We must leave, now!

729
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:36,797
-Bigg Daddy, get out of here.

730
01:10:36,928 --> 01:10:38,495
-No, Major.

731
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:41,148
We'll hold the line,
all of us together.

732
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,804
-All for one and one for all,
Colonel.

733
01:10:46,067 --> 01:10:49,462
-Don't bury us too early, okay?

734
01:10:50,594 --> 01:10:53,771
-
-Forward!

735
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:55,728
-Cut the bullshit!

736
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:58,558
We're running out of time!

737
01:11:08,002 --> 01:11:09,177
-Done.

738
01:11:09,308 --> 01:11:10,614
Get in, fast!

739
01:11:15,532 --> 01:11:18,665
-Good luck...Major.

740
01:11:20,188 --> 01:11:21,886
-Leave now.

741
01:11:28,675 --> 01:11:30,198
Anna!

742
01:11:33,593 --> 01:11:35,943
Yugoslavia?

743
01:11:38,816 --> 01:11:41,340
-I'll tell you
when we come back.

744
01:11:44,169 --> 01:11:45,518
-Deal.

745
01:11:48,347 --> 01:11:50,871
-Two, one.

746
01:14:37,385 --> 01:14:40,084
-I thought it would
be warmer here.

747
01:15:05,544 --> 01:15:09,722
What do you think
the temperature is?

748
01:15:12,986 --> 01:15:14,684
-Minus 15, max.

749
01:15:14,814 --> 01:15:16,947
That's the system limit.

750
01:15:20,298 --> 01:15:22,430
-There's nothing left.

751
01:15:40,057 --> 01:15:42,799
No infected, no bodies?

752
01:15:46,933 --> 01:15:53,287
-All my life, I've dreamt
of building this station...

753
01:15:53,418 --> 01:15:57,074
and now I only pray
I can destroy it.

754
01:16:02,469 --> 01:16:06,213
No one realized
what it really was.

755
01:16:09,085 --> 01:16:11,610
I guess millions of years ago,

756
01:16:11,741 --> 01:16:14,047
the Ice Age stopped this thing

757
01:16:14,178 --> 01:16:17,355
from conquering
the whole planet.

758
01:16:29,106 --> 01:16:31,848
Sooner or later,
it will realize

759
01:16:31,978 --> 01:16:35,373
that the permafrost
has its borders.

760
01:16:35,503 --> 01:16:38,245
It will break through.

761
01:16:40,117 --> 01:16:45,425
It not only controls the
muscular and nervous systems,

762
01:16:45,557 --> 01:16:48,386
but it's learned
to melt bodies together

763
01:16:48,516 --> 01:16:51,650
for warmth and power.

764
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,090
Now, the only thing
left for me to do

765
01:16:57,221 --> 01:17:02,705
is to go out and see it
for the last time before I die.

766
01:17:07,405 --> 01:17:10,887
It's still beautiful.

767
01:17:18,329 --> 01:17:20,460
-All the cooling systems
are damaged.

768
01:17:20,592 --> 01:17:23,160
Without them,
the suits are useless.

769
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:25,031
-He lost a lot of blood.

770
01:17:25,162 --> 01:17:27,468
he couldn't have gone that far.

771
01:17:28,687 --> 01:17:30,123
-Too long anyway.

772
01:17:30,254 --> 01:17:32,386
It's 200 degrees outside.

773
01:17:32,517 --> 01:17:34,475
It's a grill.

774
01:17:34,606 --> 01:17:37,261
-Technically...

775
01:17:37,391 --> 01:17:40,133
you can survive this temperature

776
01:17:40,264 --> 01:17:46,749
for some time.

777
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,838
-Last year,
one poor fellow went outside

778
01:17:48,968 --> 01:17:50,535
with a damaged cooling system,

779
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:51,884
and five minutes later,

780
01:17:52,014 --> 01:17:54,017
we cut the suit off him

781
01:17:54,147 --> 01:17:56,672
with his skin.

782
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:59,152
-Five minutes.

783
01:18:08,161 --> 01:18:09,335
-Hey!

784
01:18:09,467 --> 01:18:11,991
Hey, Anna,
don't even think about it!

785
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:20,217
-Leave us.

786
01:18:24,003 --> 01:18:26,484
-Grigoriev was right.

787
01:18:26,614 --> 01:18:30,227
It all has to stay here.

788
01:18:30,357 --> 01:18:32,532
If I get out of here,

789
01:18:32,664 --> 01:18:35,666
I can't afford to keep silent.

790
01:18:38,103 --> 01:18:40,193
I am an officer, after all.

791
01:18:45,982 --> 01:18:47,766
Fedorova...

792
01:18:47,897 --> 01:18:50,246
people up there

793
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:51,857
need you more than me.

794
01:19:00,126 --> 01:19:03,389
When you make it to the surface,

795
01:19:03,521 --> 01:19:07,351
ask for General Gromov.

796
01:19:09,527 --> 01:19:11,398
He'll look after you.

797
01:19:15,228 --> 01:19:17,143
You won't let me down.

798
01:19:17,273 --> 01:19:18,710
I know it.

799
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:21,974
I'll try to be back
in five minutes.

800
01:19:28,067 --> 01:19:29,982
-Three minutes.

801
01:19:34,073 --> 01:19:37,947
Everyone who was here,

802
01:19:38,077 --> 01:19:41,254
Grigoriev, they all sacrificed

803
01:19:41,385 --> 01:19:43,779
their own lives

804
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:47,085
so nobody would find out about
what happened down here.

805
01:19:47,217 --> 01:19:50,133
-Grigoriev was insane,
unfortunately.

806
01:19:50,263 --> 01:19:53,919
-But he was right.

807
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:56,879
If we get out of here,

808
01:19:57,009 --> 01:19:59,142
nobody mustn't tell anything

809
01:19:59,272 --> 01:20:01,057
about what happened down here.

810
01:20:02,275 --> 01:20:03,799
-The station is fucked.

811
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:05,539
What's the difference?

812
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:09,892
We can't get out
without the key.

813
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:12,590
-Someday...

814
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,202
somebody will come here

815
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:19,335
to study and use it,

816
01:20:19,466 --> 01:20:21,251
and it will be a catastrophe.

817
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:23,993
-You're right.

818
01:20:24,123 --> 01:20:26,212
We'll keep quiet.

819
01:20:28,475 --> 01:20:30,521
-I used to dream that,

820
01:20:30,651 --> 01:20:33,611
becoming a great scientist here.

821
01:20:38,659 --> 01:20:40,400
That sounds so stupid now.

822
01:20:40,531 --> 01:20:42,011
No.

823
01:20:44,883 --> 01:20:47,190
-Yes, it has to stay a secret.

824
01:20:52,804 --> 01:20:56,112
It will always be a priority.

825
01:21:02,509 --> 01:21:05,686
-They won't just leave us here,

826
01:21:05,817 --> 01:21:07,732
will they?

827
01:21:22,746 --> 01:21:24,227
-Well?

828
01:21:28,057 --> 01:21:30,581
Who's the next one to go?

829
01:22:03,527 --> 01:22:05,050
-Don't!

830
01:22:06,486 --> 01:22:08,445
Doc!
-Anna!

831
01:22:10,447 --> 01:22:12,362
-Anna!

832
01:25:41,092 --> 01:25:43,181
-You're reckless, you know that.

833
01:25:43,312 --> 01:25:46,271
-Give me the key, please.

834
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:50,710
-Peter.

835
01:25:50,841 --> 01:25:52,755
-No, please.

836
01:25:54,192 --> 01:25:56,063
I mean it.

837
01:25:58,501 --> 01:26:00,198
-Peter.

838
01:26:07,466 --> 01:26:09,207
You're a fucking fool, Peter!

839
01:26:09,338 --> 01:26:11,949
-Am I?

840
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:14,952
What about Grigoriev?

841
01:26:15,082 --> 01:26:18,521
I knew he was concealing
something amazing here,

842
01:26:18,651 --> 01:26:21,959
but not this amazing.

843
01:26:22,089 --> 01:26:25,484
-
What are you talking about?

844
01:26:25,615 --> 01:26:28,183
I saw that.

845
01:26:28,313 --> 01:26:32,361
That's the end
of the human race.

846
01:26:32,491 --> 01:26:34,189
Yeah, maybe it's death.

847
01:26:34,318 --> 01:26:36,755
We'll handle it.

848
01:26:36,887 --> 01:26:39,889
It will be my biggest discovery.

849
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:46,331
The whole world will know me.

850
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:50,466
-You might still be useful.

851
01:26:53,947 --> 01:26:56,123
I still need that key.

852
01:27:10,921 --> 01:27:13,010
You shouldn't do that.

853
01:27:58,577 --> 01:28:00,275
-Nikolay.

854
01:28:02,407 --> 01:28:05,584
You go first.

855
01:28:05,715 --> 01:28:08,761
-Peter...

856
01:28:08,892 --> 01:28:11,634
go fuck yourself.

857
01:28:24,516 --> 01:28:26,388
-Go, Anna.

858
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:53,562
-Where is Nikolay?

859
01:29:53,692 --> 01:29:55,389
-Probably dead.

860
01:29:58,827 --> 01:30:00,699
Maybe you should go...

861
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:02,962
and check.

862
01:30:04,398 --> 01:30:05,312
Don't worry, Anna.

863
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:07,837
I will send some help soon.

864
01:35:54,835 --> 01:35:57,925
-Anna?

865
01:36:01,016 --> 01:36:03,975
Where -- Where is Peter?

866
01:36:04,106 --> 01:36:06,673
-He's not coming with us.

867
01:37:29,582 --> 01:37:31,323
-Come on!

868
01:37:31,454 --> 01:37:33,237
Hurry up!

869
01:37:33,369 --> 01:37:34,936
-It's stuck in the corridor.

870
01:37:42,291 --> 01:37:43,161
Faster.

871
01:37:56,305 --> 01:37:57,827
-Come on!

872
01:37:57,959 --> 01:38:00,526
Come on, you fucking...

873
01:38:02,964 --> 01:38:04,530
It's coming.

874
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,812
-Anna...

875
01:39:03,327 --> 01:39:06,941
-I...

876
01:39:07,071 --> 01:39:10,683
I know...

877
01:39:10,814 --> 01:39:12,990
you are...

878
01:39:13,121 --> 01:39:14,861
here.

879
01:39:41,932 --> 01:39:44,717
Do...

880
01:39:44,848 --> 01:39:45,892
something.

881
01:40:02,822 --> 01:40:05,216
Please.

882
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:25,019
-We can't go up.

883
01:40:30,937 --> 01:40:33,505
We cannot risk like that.

884
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:37,943
-Please, Anna.

885
01:40:40,991 --> 01:40:42,732
-There are people up here.

886
01:40:44,951 --> 01:40:46,648
-I'm not...

887
01:40:46,779 --> 01:40:48,346
dying here.

888
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:17,505
-We have to crush the lift.

889
01:41:17,636 --> 01:41:22,250
We need to enter the wrong code
three times.

890
01:42:03,073 --> 01:42:04,422
-Anna.

891
01:42:31,623 --> 01:42:36,411
-I can feel you inside, Anna.

892
01:42:51,861 --> 01:42:53,818
-Yugoslavia.

893
01:43:01,653 --> 01:43:04,656
-Crush...

894
01:43:04,787 --> 01:43:06,919
elevator.

895
01:44:46,758 --> 01:44:48,412
-Please remain seated

896
01:44:48,543 --> 01:44:51,502
and wait until you have
reached the surface.

897
01:45:37,026 --> 01:45:39,855
Warning.
Incorrect sequence.

898
01:45:39,985 --> 01:45:42,335
Two attempts remaining.

899
01:46:37,434 --> 01:46:40,263
Warning.
Incorrect sequence.

900
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:42,960
One attempt remaining.

901
01:47:32,794 --> 01:47:35,405
-Warning.
Incorrect sequence.

902
01:47:35,536 --> 01:47:39,409
Self-destruct in five...

903
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:45,719
...four, three...

904
01:47:45,850 --> 01:47:50,942
...two, one.

905
01:48:15,837 --> 01:48:18,448
-Get the chopper ready.
We have a survivor.

906
01:48:18,579 --> 01:48:21,495
I repeat, we have a survivor.
Over.

907
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:40,339
-Help her! Quick!

908
01:48:41,558 --> 01:48:43,734
Don't move.

909
01:48:43,865 --> 01:48:46,607
-Don't shoot.
We need her alive.

910
01:48:46,737 --> 01:48:50,523
-Stop the car!

911
01:48:50,654 --> 01:48:53,048
Stop the car!

912
01:48:53,178 --> 01:48:55,093
-Don't shoot!
-Don't you move!

913
01:48:55,224 --> 01:48:56,791
Get away from me.

914
01:48:56,921 --> 01:48:58,270
-Let her go.

915
01:48:58,401 --> 01:48:59,315
-Not another step!

916
01:48:59,445 --> 01:49:01,796
-I said, let her go!

917
01:49:36,918 --> 01:49:39,529
-Everything is under control.

918
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,230
We can help you.

919
01:49:45,361 --> 01:49:47,362
Calm down.

920
01:49:51,889 --> 01:49:53,891
Put the grenade down.

921
01:49:54,022 --> 01:49:55,980
Put it down! Now!

922
01:49:56,111 --> 01:49:58,679
Put the fucking grenade down!

923
01:49:58,809 --> 01:50:01,550
Get back -- now!
