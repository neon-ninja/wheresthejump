It's difficult to get
to the bottom of that one.

is he still Louis?

Sophie, wh... what are you doing here?

863
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,830
You're hardly at home anymore.

864
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,877
So I figured I'd bring your mail.

865
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,679
It looked important.

866
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,314
W... why'd you open this?
It's addressed to me.

867
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,835
Sophie.

868
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,759
Don't do that.

869
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,759
So there's no way Louis
could've written the letters?

870
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,355
It's impossible.

871
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,035
But he sat up and spoke, right?
Why not possible?

872
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:47,553
The seizure was a fluke,
a muscle spasm maybe,

873
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,031
a brief return to apparent consciousness.

874
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,275
If you're waiting for him to wake up

875
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,000
and give you a statement,
I wouldn't hold your breath.

876
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,916
You think Drax is stalking her?

877
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,550
How is she coping?

878
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,354
She's distraught.

879
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,831
- You think she's headed for a breakdown?
- No.

880
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,833
I mean, she's in a vulnerable state.

881
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,232
Yeah, but is she, like,
breakdown material?

882
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,150
I can't see how she can stand
this kind of pressure

883
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,112
much longer, if that's what you mean.

884
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,515
I'd like to hear
what you know about Louis' fall,

885
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,954
the version Natalie told you.

886
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,080
Uh, why?

887
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,996
I thought that since
you had a certain... friendship with her,

888
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,197
that you might
have some insight that would help us.

889
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,714
I don't think I do.

890
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,959
Did you know that Peter Drax
isn't Louis' biological father?

891
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,720
I did.

892
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,677
So if she told you that,
she probably also told you

893
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,878
that she put Louis up
for adoption when he was just a baby.

894
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,397
I... I didn't know that.

895
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,320
But I'm not surprised she didn't tell me.

896
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,040
That's pretty private, don't you think?

897
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,118
[WHISPERS] Of course it's private.

898
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,710
Oh, one more thing.

899
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,240
Peter Drax's mother is coming to town

900
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,640
so we can ask her some questions
about the letter.

901
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,792
She asked to see Louis.
I don't have any reason to stop her.

902
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,876
I'll be sure to let reception know.

903
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,399
A little word of advice, you might want
to keep her away from your girlfriend.

904
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,433
From what I hear,
they're not the best of friends.

905
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,793
I'll keep that in mind.

I was looking for you.
Do you have a second?

908
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,318
I want to talk to you about something.

909
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,036
Macy said I could use the showers.

910
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,156
It's not about that.

911
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,116
Come in.

01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,113
Do you want to sit down?

913
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,316
No.

914
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,350
I have to thank you again.

915
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,792
Everyone here has been so supportive.

916
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,073
One of the guys
at the front desk even said

917
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,719
he could get a TV in here for me.

918
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,914
Why didn't you tell me
that Peter isn't Louis' father?

919
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,639
I know it's probably none of my business,

920
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,633
but you volunteered to me that Peter

921
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,473
was the only man you'd ever been with,

922
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:34,349
and I don't know,
why tell such a specific lie?

923
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,550
Can you give me a moment
to put myself together?

924
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,909
Sure.

925
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,954
Would you mind turning around?

926
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,390
Of course.

927
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,476
Okay.

928
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,320
Who's the father?

929
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,632
His name was Joe.

930
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,514
Joseph. We only spent one night together.

931
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,672
It's not exactly my favorite subject.

932
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,959
- It might help to tell me.
- It won't.

933

- Well, if other people know...
- Other people don't know,

934
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,200
and there's a good reason
for that, trust me.

But... as Louis' doctor, as your friend...

936
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,239
The nature of Louis' conception

937
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,073
isn't something I'd wish on any woman.

938
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,599
Natalie, I am so sorry.

939
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:48,956
The birth was terrible.

It nearly killed us both.

941
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,993
But I don't regret any of it.

942
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,479
If it weren't for what happened,
Louis would have never have been born.

943
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,760
It was brave of you to keep him.

944

She came to the ward today.

Nothing.

that I meant to be.

How would a nine-year-old boy
know what poison to prescribe

1206
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,513
and not only that, the exact right dosage?

1207
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:42,833
That seems like knowledge
belonging to a pharmacist.

1208
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,360
- Or a doctor.
- But by all accounts,

1209
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,557
the boy is incredibly
bright and well-read.

1210
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:54,470
This is not a sophisticated prescription.

1211

Insulin, chloroform?

1212
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,235
And this is not the work
of a medical professional.

1213
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:02,111
Maybe he's trying to tell us something.

1214
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,755
That he wants his mother dead?

1215
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:10,234
Do you want his mother dead, Dr. Pascal?

1216

[SHOUTING] Of course not!

1217

You have a history of sleepwalking, Doc.

1218
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,999
This behavior, while bizarre,
is explainable, and frankly,

1219
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,197
it doesn't matter
why you wrote the letters.

1220
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,795
You didn't know Peter and Louis Drax
before the incident.

1221
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:34,035
You are not a suspect. You are...
eccentric, perhaps, but not a suspect.

1222
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,635
Then why does this feel
like an interrogation?

1223
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,715
Peter Drax's body was found in a cave

1224
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,640
500 yards from where Louis was rescued.

1225
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,710
So?

1226
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,753
That doesn't seem
like a coincidence to you?

1227
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:52,597
That the two bodies
were found in the same place?

[EERIE MUSIC]

1229
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:22,119
Did Louis ever express
any anger toward Natalie?

1230
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,511
Did you never suspect that she might
be involved in the accident?

1231
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,116
What are you getting at?

1232
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,760
Don't you think it's strange that Louis
would have me write that prescription?

1233
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:35,400
[CHUCKLES] Strange?

1234
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:38,873
To who? What part? How strange?

1235
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,669
Doctor, those letters
are coming out of your head

1236
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:49,672
through your frustrations, fears,
repressed thoughts, feelings...

I'm sure you're right.

1239
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,358
No, Louis probably
has nothing to do with this.

1240
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,194
But what if you're wrong.

1241
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,673
What if Louis is reaching out?

1242
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,392
As his doctor,
it's my responsibility to help him.

But I need you to be careful

1246

Now shift your focus
to the tip of your nose.
