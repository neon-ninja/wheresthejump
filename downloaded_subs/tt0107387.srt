1
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,383
Try as they will and
try as they might,

2
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:54,554
who steals me gold won't
live through the night.

3
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,791
A limousine?

4
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,378
What in the world has
gotten into you, Mr. O'Grady?

5
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,424
Just the start, my dear.
Just the start.

6
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:17,595
Take the last look at this dump.

7
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:21,891
Tomorrow we'll be
looking at mansions.

8
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:25,061
Mansions? Will you
listen to yourself?

9
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:29,899
And a limousine?
We've got no money for this.

10
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,119
Right inside.

11
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,616
Did the funeral parlor
deliver the package?

12
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,577
Aye. 'Tis on the porch
where they left it.

13
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,913
I don't want to touch it.

14
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,667
Will you tell me what's going
on here, Daniel O'Grady?

15
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:51,504
Will that be all, sir?

16
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,758
Joseph.

17
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,553
Bon voyage, captain.

18
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,014
Thank you very much, sir.
You have a nice evening.

19
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,142
Ma'am.

20
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:09,068
What's going on here is we're rich.

21
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,983
You were supposed
to bury your mother,

22
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,363
not send her ashes all
the way from Ireland.

23
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:26,874
- What are you going to do?
- It's not me mother's ashes.

24
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,045
Gold, Leah! Gold!

25
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,173
What in the Lord's name?

26
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,677
A pot of gold.
A wee person, a leprechaun.

27
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:44,056
I caught him and made him
show me where his gold is.

28
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,809
It's the rule, you know.

29
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,396
Aye, you're a drunken fool,
and a storyteller.

30
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,608
- It's the truth, I'm telling...
- There's a storm brewing.

31
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,736
I'm telling you the truth.

32
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:02,074
Come on to bed, now, and I'll
make you a pot of nice hot tea.

33
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,326
Leprechaun indeed.

34
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,913
Pot of gold. Whatever next?

35
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,561
Dan? Dan, is that you?

36
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:35,608
Mary had a little lamb

37
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:40,571
Little lamb, little lamb

38
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:44,950
Mary had a little lamb

39
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:49,246
Whose fleece was white as snow

40
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:53,209
He followed her to school one day

41
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,629
School one day school one day

42
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,673
He followed her to school one day

43
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:03,469
Which was against the rules

44
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,097
I can't breathe.
Please open the suitcase.

45
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,817
I'm going to suffocate.

46
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,571
Do you like the gold
buckles on me shoes?

47
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,825
I want me gold now!

48
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:29,330
Oh, God, no!

49
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,016
Oh.

50
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,485
No problem.

51
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,358
I smell some tea brewing.

52
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,534
I hid the gold, Leah. We're rich now.

53
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,996
Where did you hide it, Dan?

54
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,714
Did you hide it somewhere
near the house?

55
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,216
Tell me where you hid the gold.

56
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,885
How did you find me?

57
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,847
The wee people have
their magical ways.

58
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:33,601
I knew it. What have
you done with my wife?

59
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:36,937
Oh. Oh, the poor lass.

60
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,658
I should've told her
to watch her step.

61
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,946
I got ya! It's my gold!

62
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,375
I'll fix him. I'll get him.

63
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:54,330
Your wife makes a fine pot
of tea, Danny me boy.

64
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:57,082
Where did you get that?

65
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,585
- I'll fix you, you bastard!
- No! No!

66
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,338
Here's what you'll get, you monster.

67
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,548
Get it away! Put it away!

68
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,217
I got the gold fair and square.

69
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,470
Them were the rules.

70
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,558
Catch me if you can!

71
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,278
You can't get away.

72
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,155
Looking for something?

73
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,704
What did you do?

74
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,371
You... You killed my wife.

75
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,082
Hello, Dan. I'm okay.

76
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,834
I just got a little kink in me neck.

77
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,088
I should have killed you when
I caught you in Ireland.

78
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,090
Give him the gold, Dan.

79
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,634
He's a nice little leprechaun.

80
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,428
I'll give you more than gold!

81
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,225
Your bullets won't stop me forever.

82
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,945
I'll keep coming back.

83
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:32,136
The power of this clover will
keep you in there forever.

84
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,888
Get that damn clover off this crate!

85
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,474
I told you you couldn't kill me.

86
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,649
Where's me gold, Danny me boy?

87
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,290
Oh, Danny, don't strain yourself now.

88
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,836
No, not gasoline.

89
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,797
You can't burn me. I won't let ya.

90
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,343
Don't strain yourself.

91
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,804
You're not as young
as you used to be.

92
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,015
You might have a stroke.

93
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,226
I curse ye for all eternity.

94
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,772
I traded me soul for me gold.

95
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,559
You'll trade your life.

96
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,361
If you give me me gold back...

97
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,864
I'll go away.

98
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,951
- Oh!
- Danny! What's wrong?

99
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,101
Burn in hell,
you little green bastard!

100
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,681
Did the match go out, Danny?

101
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:35,801
<i>I say I need a four-leaf clover</i>

102
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:41,598
<i>One that's strong
and won't blow away</i>

103
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:47,479
<i>Won't you be my four-leaf clover</i>

104
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,611
<i>Be my lucky charm
that's here to stay</i>

105
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,409
Dad, I'm still depressed.

106
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,661
I mean, come on.
Here I am in New Mexico

107
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,164
with my hick father
for the whole summer.

108
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,333
- Hey.
- No offense.

109
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,254
First of all, it's not New
Mexico, it's North Dakota.

110
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,430
Like it matters. All I care
about is it's not L.A.

111
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,035
Wait.

112
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,953
This is a joke, right?

113
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,705
This is our poor neighbor's house,

114
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,504
and then you're gonna
take us to our house.

115
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,885
Never judge a book
by its cover, honey.

116
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:01,013
Dad, this book doesn't
even have a cover.

117
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,775
I'm going to be miserable here.
There's no swimming pool.

118
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,694
There's no shopping malls.
There's no cable.

119
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,821
Bet you don't even have a TV.

120
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,541
Oh, this sure ain't Beverly Hills.

121
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:33,591
I can't wait to see this house.

122
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,908
Careful.

123
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,036
Oh, great.

124
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,998
Just when I thought this house
couldn't get any worse,

125
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,458
an old basement.

126
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,588
Well, great place to store all the
rocks and pinecones I'm gonna find.

127
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,883
Okay, okay. It's a little dusty.
I admit that.

128
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,470
Just clean it up a little bit,
splash some paint around.

129
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,348
Oh, God. You'll need to slap
some bulldozers around

130
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,475
to fix this place up.

131
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,936
Oh, God! Gross. Cobwebs.

132
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,273
You're making too big a
deal out of this, honey.

133
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:40,402
This is a great house.
I got a great buy on it.

134
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,905
Yeah, from who, Dracula?

135
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,784
How about I get a hotel
somewhere in town,

136
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,079
and you can come visit,
like, once a week?

137
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,500
- Hey, I'll pay for it.
- Tory, honey,

138
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:00,380
you really think money's all you
need to get by in this life?

139
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,591
Okay. I'll go with that theory.

140
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,347
Oh...

141
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,309
Dad! Do you see that spider?

142
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,437
It's huge. That thing could kill us.

143
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,523
Okay, I'm going to turn around and
I'm walking out of this basement,

144
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,192
and I'm going back up to the jeep.

145
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,028
I'm making a reservation at
the nearest hotel in town.

146
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,905
This is worse than summer camp!

147
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,199
I'd rather sleep in a tent!

148
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,580
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
Hello? We're breaking up.

149
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,375
Wait. Okay. Okay. That's good.

150
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,627
Okay, hi. I'd like to
make a reservation.

151
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,630
Yes. I'd like it to be a really tall
room, and I want it to be very...

152
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,007
- Oh!
- Great!

153
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,134
Who are you?

154
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,388
I was a guy carrying
some paint thinner.

155
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,390
Oh, G... Okay.

156
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,350
Here. Does that cover?

157
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,227
Wait. Hold on a second.

158
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,312
You knock over my can
of paint thinner,

159
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,273
and then you offer me 20 bucks?

160
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,859
Okay. Okay.

161
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,570
How about that? Will that do it?

162
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,239
No.

163
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,994
But maybe if you said you were
sorry, you know, it might.

164
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,663
Okay. Here. Look, keep the change.
I'm in a really big hurry.

165
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,582
There's a big, ugly, disgusting house
I'd just like to distance myself from.

166
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,543
What, you mean this house here?
The O'Grady place?

167
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,462
Yeah, that place. It's really gross.
There's bugs. There's cobwebs.

168
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,881
God only knows what else is in there.

169
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:28,844
What's so funny?

170
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,846
Well, I just think it's
funny the way girls

171
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,931
are always afraid of spiders
and stuff, you know?

172
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,309
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, wait a minute.

173
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,355
Did I misplace my 1950s
calendar here? Girls?

174
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,275
Listen, Bud. Okay, this is the '90s.

175
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,069
Women are treated equal.

176
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,072
Well, first off, my name
isn't Bud, it's Nathan.

177
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:53,076
And I don't know many guys
that are afraid of houses.

178
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,537
- Oh, is that so?
- Yeah.

179
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,039
Well, you know what? Neither am I.

180
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,708
I'm not afraid of anything.

181
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,084
- Okay.
- Right.

182
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,545
- Tory? Honey?
- Yeah?

183
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,921
- What?
- Let's go.

184
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,590
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?

185
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,885
I'm not gonna fight you anymore.
The house. You hate the house.

186
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,137
- No...
- It's dirty, it's dusty.

187
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:16,099
You really think I'm afraid of
a little dust and some bugs?

188
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,768
Come on. Just put
the bags back, okay?

189
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,988
I want to stay.

190
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,941
Dad, would you put the bags back?

191
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,036
I'm gonna stay.

192
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,707
Anyway, listen, listen.

193
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,293
It came right down out of the sky.

194
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,171
There it was,

195
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,507
this flying saucer.

196
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,551
Had these really weird
lights, you know?

197
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,803
And making all these weird noises.

198
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,389
Kind of like... Kind of like,
"boop boop boop boop..."

199
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,985
Ozzie, I thought you weren't
gonna tell any more stories.

200
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:04,147
This really happened, Alex. It did.

201
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,858
It's like magic, you know? Like...

202
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,778
Like, um...

203
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,240
Well, when you see
a star in the night sky...

204
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,784
the first star...
you can make a wish.

205
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:19,621
- It'll come true.
- Stop with the magic stuff.

206
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,875
And no more lies, okay?

207
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,837
How ya doin', boys? I'm J.D.

208
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,798
I just met your brother Nathan.

209
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,218
Hi, I'm Alex. Nice to meet you.
This is my friend Ozzie.

210
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,678
- How you doin', Ozzie?
- Hi.

211
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,515
So, you boys need any help out here?

212
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,725
I'm afraid that our
liability insurance forbids

213
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,478
anyone but us handling
the tools and equipment.

214
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,027
But thanks for the offer.

215
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,656
Boy, I could go for a beer right now.

216
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,408
You're too little to drink.

217
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,661
Don't you ever,
ever drink that stuff!

218
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,454
- Hey, Ozzie, what's this?
- Hey!

219
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,128
Gotcha! Whoa! Let go!

220
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,065
Nathan?

221
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,049
Oh, geez, I'm sorry. You all right?

222
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,635
I was on that shelf, looking for tarps.
I didn't know you were down here.

223
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,346
I was just trying to
make a peace offering,

224
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,307
but I think it's all in that crate.

225
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,309
Hope I didn't ruin what's inside.

226
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,228
Oh, you couldn't
damage what's in here.

227
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,190
- The O'Gradys collected a lot of junk.
- The O'Gradys?

228
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:14,110
Yeah, Dan O'Grady.
He used to own this place.

229
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,656
He was really a weird,
strange guy, you know?

230
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,367
Oh. You mean, weird and strange

231
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:25,339
like guys who drive dented pick-up
trucks and paint houses for a living?

232
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,124
Hey, let's see what
he's got in this thing.

233
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,502
Yeah.

234
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,296
Well, that is, of course,
unless you're scared.

235
00:19:34,597 --> 00:19:36,549
Scared? Me?

236
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,969
Give me a crowbar.
I'll bust it open myself.

237
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,222
Got a hammer.

238
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:45,225
Fine. Hammer is good. Hammer.

239
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,663
That sounds like Ozzie.

240
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,108
Oh, no!

241
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:57,779
As fashion statements go,
blue is not your best color.

242
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,366
Alex, I asked you to
hold that ladder steady.

243
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,910
Now look what happened!

244
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,955
I'm not even gonna ask
what happened, really.

245
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,374
There's a bathroom off
the kitchen in there.

246
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,048
At least, it looked a
little like a bathroom.

247
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:15,689
I don't even like blue.

248
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,323
Twinkle, twinkle

249
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,658
Little star

250
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,411
- How I wonder
- Hello?

251
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,290
What you are

252
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,964
Up above the world so high

253
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,468
- Who's in there?
- Like a diamond in the sky

254
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:05,346
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

255
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:09,727
How I wonder what you are

256
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,002
Hello?

257
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,294
Hello?

258
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,175
Wow. What neat junk.

259
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,803
Please let me out. Please.

260
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,014
Why won't you let me
out of this crate?

261
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,141
How did you get in there?

262
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,144
Please, let me out.

263
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,605
Please, I don't like it in here.

264
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,733
Please.

265
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,823
Hello?

266
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,408
Hello?

267
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:12,923
I'm back.

268
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:21,716
Hey, tubby, you got a light
for an old leprechaun's pipe?

269
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,184
I'm starved.
Haven't eaten in ten years.

270
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,529
What... What are you?

271
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,858
What do I look like, me lad?

272
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,486
See the hat? The buckles on me shoes?

273
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,705
Why, I'm a leprechaun.

274
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,992
A shoemaker by trade.

275
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,245
And speaking of shoes,

276
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,747
yours could use a shine.

277
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,875
But first...

278
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:02,013
have you seen a crock
of gold lying around?

279
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,342
Tell me, or I'll bite your ear off,

280
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:09,012
and I'll make a boot out of it.

281
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:25,445
You only got away 'cause
me powers are weak.

282
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,914
I need me gold!

283
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,283
There's a leprechaun in the basement!

284
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,993
Oh, there's a leprechaun
in the basement!

285
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:35,038
- Hold on. Slow down.
- He come right up out of a box.

286
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,666
He had these long really
scary fingers, and...

287
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:42,170
He wasn't nice like Lucky Charms or
anything, and then he ate a bug!

288
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,421
A leprechaun?

289
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,341
Can we inject a little bit
of reality in here, please?

290
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,593
I saw him! I really did see him!

291
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,720
He even tried to polish my shoes!

292
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,264
- So, then, where's your pot of gold?
- That's what he said he wanted.

293
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,517
- He said he wanted his pot of gold.
- All right.

294
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,478
Where you going?

295
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,855
Well, if it'll make you
feel any better, Ozzie,

296
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,732
we'll all go down in the
basement and check it out.

297
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,401
Don't go in there, don't go
in there, don't go in there!

298
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:09,822
Hey. Okay? Just in case.

299
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,075
I better go with you.

300
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,285
Just in case.

301
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,120
Nathan? Nathan?

302
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,873
I don't think that stick's
gonna be big enough.

303
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:23,299
Well, wait. Wait for me.
I'm coming, just in case.

304
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,722
Geez, Ozzie, you really
busted up this crate.

305
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:38,017
No, no, no. No, I...
I did... I didn't do that.

306
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,437
That... that was the leprechaun.

307
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,940
Leprechaun.

308
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,445
Well, I don't see anything, Ozzie.

309
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:55,076
But... this guy was real.

310
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,578
I mean, he had buckles on his shoes,

311
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,748
and he had them real horrible teeth,

312
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,584
and they were all rotten and
everything, and... and...

313
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:07,089
Oh, I... I know he
never does brush 'em.

314
00:25:09,858 --> 00:25:11,384
Th-That's him.

315
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,354
He's gonna kill every one
of us, and I'm first.

316
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:33,156
- Ozzie, come here.
- I ain't goin' in that dark corner.

317
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,455
Neither am I.

318
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,537
What was that?

319
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,040
Hey, hang on. Hang on.

320
00:25:57,576 --> 00:25:59,054
It's only a rat.

321
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,727
It's just a rat.

322
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,021
Well, Ozzie, I think we
found your leprechaun.

323
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,398
No, no, no.

324
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,277
Y-You don't understand. He...
He was bigger than that.

325
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,529
All right, all right. I think
we've solved this mystery now.

326
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,283
Can we just get out of here?

327
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,258
- Hey! Hey, look up in the sky!
- So what, Ozzie?

328
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,013
- It's just a rainbow.
- It's a magic rainbow.

329
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:41,766
Leprechauns and rainbows.
It's a sign.

330
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,852
Yeah. Yeah, it's a sign, all right.
It's time to get back to painting.

331
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,938
- Come on.
- No, no, no. No.

332
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,940
We gotta go... go see
what's at the end.

333
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,234
Ozzie, you're embarrassing me.

334
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,903
Come on. Go with me.

335
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,822
We... We gotta get to
the end of the rainbow.

336
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,199
- There's always a pot of gold!
- Ozzie.

337
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,159
He's so easily sidetracked.

338
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,578
Like always, I'll take care of it
and get him back on the job.

339
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,998
Ozzie, come on! Alex!

340
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,084
Oh, come on. Let 'em
go chase rainbows.

341
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,836
Let's you and I go paint.

342
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,806
Um, this is biodegradable, right?

343
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,803
Ozzie, this is stupid! You can't
find the end of the rainbow!

344
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,518
It's where the rainbow ends.

345
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,436
It does sort of look
like where it ends.

346
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,565
Hey, look. It's going away.

347
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:38,156
Don't cut yourself on any
of this rusty old metal.

348
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:42,287
If you do, it'll make
your jaw lock shut.

349
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,746
This is neat. Hey,
Ozzie, I got an idea.

350
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,623
- What?
- Let's hotwire this.

351
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,798
I don't think the battery
would be any good.

352
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,965
Ooh.

353
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,259
Look at that.

354
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,386
- Ooh!
- Give me it!

355
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,762
- No, no, no.
- Give me it!

356
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,182
- Just let me look at it for a minute!
- Give me it!

357
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:07,482
I'll give it right back to you,
I promise. I promise.

358
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,649
- Give me that.
- Hey!

359
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,112
Wow! Look at that!

360
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,906
All right, here's your coin.

361
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,751
I found a bag full of 'em!

362
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,994
- Wow!
- Cool!

363
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,764
I told you. I told you!

364
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,416
It's what that leprechaun
was talking about.

365
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,628
Will you stop with that
stupid leprechaun stuff?

366
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:37,298
We found this gold. Finders keepers.

367
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,551
I just hope it's real.

368
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,803
I know how to tell if it's real.
You just bite on it.

369
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,597
I seen it in a movie.

370
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,146
Oh, my God.
I swallowed that gold coin.

371
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,320
Nice going, Jaws.

372
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,236
Hey, hey, hey, can you die
from swallowing gold?

373
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,321
Yeah, after I kill you!

374
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,157
Now, you just let me
take charge, okay?

375
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,909
I'm just gonna keep one,

376
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,120
and then I can get it checked out
in town and see if it's real or not.

377
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,457
We're gonna hide the rest.
We can't tell anyone about this.

378
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,460
Right, right. Why?

379
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:18,172
'Cause you know how adults are,
especially when it comes to money.

380
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,675
They'll just try to take it away.

381
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,886
I got the perfect place to hide it...

382
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,555
the old well beside the house.

383
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,900
Hey, Ozzie, do you
know what this means?

384
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:34,272
We're rich, and... and I
can buy comics every week.

385
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:38,818
- Yeah, but you know what else?
- What else?

386
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,362
We can get you an operation.

387
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,990
- For what?
- To make you smart.

388
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,075
See, we can go to the hospital

389
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,536
and have them operate
and fix your brain.

390
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:52,456
But... But I-I'm smart.

391
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,918
Yeah, well, sort of.

392
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,254
What I mean is,
we could make you real smart.

393
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:01,474
That way, people won't
make fun of you.

394
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,635
- They make fun of me?
- Not in front of you.

395
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:09,232
Only behind your back.
Come on. Let's go the well.

396
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,115
Come on!

397
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:32,788
Um, wait. Here, start in the corners.

398
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:36,793
Nice, even strokes.

399
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:40,046
Wow. That's it.

400
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,798
- You got it.
- Not bad?

401
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,722
Yeah, yeah. A regular Picasso.

402
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,013
Put me out of business.

403
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,307
- Oh, need another can of paint.
- Oh, okay.

404
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,726
Well, you just watch how
a pro gets a can of paint.

405
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:57,276
All right. Let me get a rag first,
all right? Go ahead.

406
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,331
Oh...

407
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,338
Nathan.

408
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:25,342
Nathan, come on. What are you doing?

409
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,430
Oh, my God.

410
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:34,934
Oh, what was that?

411
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,186
Oh, geez.

412
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,480
Honey, are you okay?
I heard you scream.

413
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,024
I thought that was
you rubbing my leg.

414
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,485
- And you let me?
- That's not the point.

415
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,445
Something was rubbing my leg,

416
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,657
like caressing it,
and it ran off over there.

417
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,992
It's probably just an
old possum, honey.

418
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,828
No, Dad, that was
not an animal, okay?

419
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,747
I know what it feels like
when a man caresses my leg.

420
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,165
You do?

421
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,209
Look, we gotta get
these cuts cleaned up.

422
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,586
Yeah, I should probably go
look for that animal?

423
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,005
- Absolutely.
- Wait. Why?

424
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,508
- Might have rabies.
- Great.

425
00:32:12,646 --> 00:32:14,098
It was a cat.

426
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,892
I think we found your
secret admirer, honey.

427
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:20,478
It wasn't a cat.

428
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,023
Sounds hurt. Come on,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

429
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,152
Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

430
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,779
Come on, kitty. Come on.

431
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,830
Here kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

432
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,619
Here kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

433
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,205
Come on. Come on,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

434
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:41,041
What? What?

435
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,793
- What?
- The cat bit me!

436
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,671
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. Put pressure on it.

437
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,882
- It bit me! It bit me!
- Oh, my God!

438
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,634
- Stay there. Put pressure on it.
- Oh, my God!

439
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,928
It's gonna be okay, Dad.
We're gonna take you to the hospital.

440
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,930
- Truck. Ozzie, Alex!
- It bit me!

441
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,475
We're taking him to the
emergency room, all right?

442
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,398
Sit down, boy.

443
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,025
Aw, man.

444
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,651
- Oh, no!
- Come on.

445
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,571
- Alex!
- Shoot! The distributor cap.

446
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,494
Right.

447
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,255
Come on, come on!

448
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,398
Hey, guys, we may be a while, okay?

449
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,275
So why don't you go get
a bite to eat at the café?

450
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,778
- We'll see you in a bit.
- All right.

451
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,783
- This is our chance.
- What, to get something to eat?

452
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,160
- No, to check out the gold coin.
- Oh, yeah.

453
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,379
- Come on. It's getting dark.
- Okay.

454
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,438
I have never seen a coin like this.

455
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:26,605
The symbols,
incredibly strange markings.

456
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,733
Cut to the chase. What's it worth?

457
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,112
Well, if this is solid gold,

458
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:36,073
could be worth $500.

459
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,327
But if there's historical value,

460
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,914
it could be priceless.

461
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,709
Could I keep this
overnight and study it?

462
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,586
You won't lose it or
anything, will ya?

463
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,921
No, no. I'll put it in my safe.

464
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,382
I'll write up a receipt.

465
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:56,176
You... You reckon that...
that coin

466
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,806
might've come from a leprechaun?

467
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,725
Never mind.

468
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,643
Okay, we'll come back tomorrow.

469
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,938
And let's just keep this between us.

470
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,774
- Okay.
- We better get to the restaurant.

471
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,744
They're gonna be pissed
we were gone so long.

472
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,747
I must be hearing things.

473
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:15,056
Well, okay. I'll get
this put away right now.

474
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:56,593
Three left. Right.

475
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,427
There we go.

476
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,234
I want me gold coin!

477
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:15,442
Me coin!

478
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:21,155
It's not nice to steal gold
coins from a leprechaun.

479
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:25,159
Bad shop owner. Bad shop owner.

480
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,121
I'll be back.

481
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,041
Now we're going to play.

482
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,711
Do you want to play with me?

483
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,296
Oh, no!

484
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:40,300
No!

485
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:46,897
This old lep, he played one
He played pogo on his lung

486
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,850
Teach you to steal me gold.

487
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,354
Aw.

488
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,024
Can't have dirty shoes, now, can we?

489
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,365
There. Nice and shiny.

490
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:09,087
Oh. You'll bounce back in no time.

491
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:15,244
One gold coin, 99 to go.

492
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,297
By the luck of the Irish.

493
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:37,105
<i>Oh, won't you please</i>

494
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:41,819
<i>Be my four-leaf clover</i>

495
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,198
<i>Can you be my lucky charm</i>

496
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:49,493
Are you sure you told Ozzie
and Alex where this place is?

497
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,286
I mean, they were
supposed to meet us here.

498
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,497
Relax. They're kids.
Probably just stopped off

499
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,624
to buy Ozzie a comic or something.

500
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,460
Boy, what a night.

501
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:02,214
My first day here, and my
father ends up in the hospital.

502
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:05,801
Well, it's just for observation.
He'll be fine in the morning.

503
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:10,222
Look on the bright side, Tory.
I mean, the worst is over.

504
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:13,976
<i>Oh, won't you please</i>

505
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,333
Say, aren't we a little
young to be out this late?

506
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,628
No. I'm 600 years old.

507
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:25,281
Okay, smartass.

508
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,509
Why don't you take that ridiculous
mask off and step out of the car?

509
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,930
It's not nice to make
fun of a leprechaun.

510
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,266
Is that so?

511
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,566
So now you're a leprechaun?

512
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,954
You sure you don't want anything?

513
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:00,374
No. I mean, yes, I do want something.

514
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,794
What I wanted was a watercress salad

515
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:07,047
and an Evian water,
but they don't have that here.

516
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,217
All they have is cheap
whiskey and warm beer.

517
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,391
Well, here's water.

518
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,849
Geez. Thanks.

519
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,864
Okay. Okay.

520
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,082
Get away from me, you little creep!

521
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,585
Get away!

522
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:54,219
Oh, God! Okay.

523
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:17,081
So, you want to play
hide-and-seek?

524
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,510
Over here!

525
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,603
I'm over here.

526
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,248
Stop.

527
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,855
Stop!

528
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,401
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

529
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:36,738
Leave me alone!

530
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,867
Leave me alone!

531
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,914
No more.

532
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:05,934
No more.

533
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,483
Where the fuck are you?

534
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,494
Oh, thank God.

535
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,544
Thank God...

536
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:41,219
No! Oh, God!

537
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,742
Now, that was fun.

538
00:44:55,943 --> 00:45:00,030
You know, Tory,
you look a little skinny.

539
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:04,326
No offense, but,
you should have some meatloaf.

540
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,912
- I got plenty, really.
- Oh, no.

541
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:09,998
- Do you know what that is?
- Yeah, it's meatloaf.

542
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:13,043
No, that's cut-up dead cow.

543
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,587
Okay? And that's if you're
lucky, in this place.

544
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:20,342
See, I don't eat meat,
and I don't kill living things.

545
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,969
- I feel very strongly about that.
- Really?

546
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,313
Really.

547
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,808
All right.

548
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,895
What are you... Nathan,
what are you doing?

549
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,272
Cut-up dead cow. That's what
your shoe is, you know?

550
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,320
Nathan, give me my shoe.

551
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,070
Nathan, give me my shoe back!

552
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,739
Come on! Look,
Alex and Ozzie are coming.

553
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,784
Would you try to set
a mature example?

554
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:47,619
Sorry we're late.

555
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,830
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

556
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,625
We were down over at that place.

557
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:07,056
Now, where's me crock of gold?

558
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:17,279
There.

559
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,036
Dad!

560
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,134
Daah! Bah!

561
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:40,864
I want me gold!

562
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:28,270
There.

563
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,164
- Geez.
- Oh, God.

564
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,508
What the...

565
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,503
Oh, my God.

566
00:48:02,971 --> 00:48:05,006
I think something got in here.

567
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,800
No shit, Sherlock.

568
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,052
You better watch your
mouth and go wash it out

569
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,596
with soap right now, boy.

570
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,849
Sure. Sure.
And right after that, Ozzie,

571
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,524
I'll be sure to ground
myself for two weeks.

572
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,855
This is crazy.

573
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,108
- What the hell's going on here?
- Well, it could've been a bear.

574
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,527
They sometimes come down
from the hills looking for food.

575
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:29,364
Great. My dad had to bring
food into this place.

576
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,616
You know what? That leprechaun...

577
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,953
he tried to shine my shoes,
and he said he was a shoemaker.

578
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:38,039
Look, you guys can sit
around here and theorize...

579
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,501
bear or no bear...
but I am getting out of here.

580
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,753
As a matter of fact,
I'm walking out that door,

581
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,256
and I'm not coming back.

582
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,351
A little too dark out there.

583
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,062
All right. Let's clean
this place up, all right?

584
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:04,988
Here. You know how to
work one of these, right?

585
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:08,737
Okay. Fellas.

586
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:16,995
Man!

587
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:19,247
Well, we finally got that
kitchen straightened up.

588
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:23,251
Yeah. I'm really beginning to
get the hang of this thing.

589
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:29,182
- What's that?
- Sounds like a bell.

590
00:49:42,937 --> 00:49:44,855
Look what I found.

591
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,901
- Great, Ozzie.
- Great.

592
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:50,153
I'm gonna go check out the bedrooms,

593
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,405
find out where we're
gonna stay tonight.

594
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,241
Oh, great. While you do that,
I'm gonna find my purse

595
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,744
and check into a hotel.

596
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,879
Alex,

597
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,382
do you think you could
kill a leprechaun?

598
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,968
Ozzie, you can kill anything.

599
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,346
You just gotta know how to do it.

600
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:19,516
Now, me? Give me a .357 Magnum,

601
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:21,976
press it to the little
green critter's temple,

602
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,895
and blam!

603
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:26,523
Brains and guts and
oozing cruddy stuff

604
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,733
dripping all down its head.

605
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:31,578
The guy's gone with a capital "Dead."

606
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:42,997
Ozzie, will you cut it out
with that stupid bell?

607
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,890
Wait. It sounds like it's
coming from the kitchen.

608
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:15,113
We're, like, really scared, okay?

609
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:19,118
Stay here. I'm gonna check it out.

610
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,120
Nathan, be careful.

611
00:52:00,341 --> 00:52:02,093
My leg!

612
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:08,041
Caught you in a bear trap.

613
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,126
I caught you in a bear trap.

614
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,962
- You look like a stupid sap.
- What the hell are you?

615
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:16,799
Oh, oh, it looks like you're hurt.

616
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,844
Let's play surgeon.

617
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,221
No!

618
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,109
- Nathan!
- Tory, no!

619
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,737
- Tory, get back!
- What the hell happened?

620
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,697
- My leg!
- Oh, my God!

621
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,700
Oh, my God!

622
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,536
Oh, my God! Ozzie, call the police!
Call the police!

623
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,706
Get off me!

624
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:51,918
- You can't hurt me.
- Oh, my God!

625
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,172
Alex, get the shotgun!

626
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,257
All right! I'll get the shotgun.

627
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,260
- Hurry up, Alex!
- Ozzie, it's me!

628
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,346
- I gotta get the shotgun!
- Hurry!

629
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:05,848
Help! Help! It's happening!

630
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,227
The attack is on.
O'Grady farm. Send help.

631
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:13,147
The... The leprechaun is attacking.
Army, navy, guns, marines.

632
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:16,651
<i>- And we're gonna need some medicine.</i>
- Okay, thanks.

633
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:20,822
Hey, Sheriff, I just got a call from Ozzie.
Says the leprechaun is attacking.

634
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:26,160
What was it last week? Was it UFOs?

635
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,372
No, no, it was Bigfoot.

636
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:33,584
Well, you'll learn about Ozzie.
He's a good boy.

637
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:36,180
A leprechaun.

638
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,257
That's a good one.

639
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:42,844
I'm coming! Here's the shotgun!

640
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,254
Take it!

641
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,683
Kill him! Kill him!

642
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,701
Yeah!

643
00:53:52,602 --> 00:53:54,272
Ozzie, hurry up!

644
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,607
- Get this thing off me!
- Ozzie, get Alex on the porch!

645
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,610
- Come on, boy.
- I don't want to go to the porch!

646
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,162
Okay!

647
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,956
He went off through the bushes.

648
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,726
God! Nathan,
that was no fucking bear.

649
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,689
My God. It's gone.

650
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,817
God, Nathan, your leg. Look at it.

651
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,111
Oh, my God! Okay,
we gotta call a paramedic.

652
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,740
Oh, I took care of it. I called them,
told them we needed the army

653
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:48,409
and... and the medicine
and a paramedic.

654
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:52,413
Ozzie... Ozzie, y-you didn't tell them
that it was a leprechaun, did you?

655
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:55,708
Of course I did.
That's what it was, wasn't it?

656
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,919
- Okay. Okay. All right.
- Oh, geez.

657
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,424
All right. We just gotta get him
back to the house. Come on.

658
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,473
Shit! The line's dead.

659
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:13,434
- Alex, you a member of the Boy Scouts?
- Cub Scouts.

660
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,812
Good enough. Okay,
you gotta help me with this.

661
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:18,064
We gotta stop the bleeding.
Ozzie, go to the bathroom,

662
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:22,068
get everything you can:
tissue, alcohol, cotton.

663
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:25,696
Tory, did that thing look...
look like a leprechaun to you?

664
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:29,200
- Ozzie, go!
- Come on, man.

665
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:31,678
You're gonna be okay, Nathan.

666
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,455
Okay. So, as soon as
we stop the bleeding,

667
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,208
we're gonna take Nathan
out to the pickup.

668
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,794
But what if that thing
is still out there?

669
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:43,798
No way. I shot it. I put six
rounds into that thing.

670
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:47,051
- Yeah. It's gotta be dead.
- Yeah.

671
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,387
All right. Alex, go the fridge.
Get me some ice.

672
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:52,107
It'll stop the swelling
on Nathan's leg.

673
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,604
Alex, get the door.

674
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,107
Come on.

675
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:03,693
Hurry up and get him out of here!

676
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:06,196
I don't see him.

677
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,657
- Where is the old guy?
- Hurry.

678
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:12,076
- Come on. Be careful.
- Hold on, Nathan.

679
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,911
- Need help?
- Yeah.

680
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,706
- Okay.
- Oh, God. Do you see him?

681
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:20,552
- Oh, God, that hurts.
- Almost there.

682
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:23,504
Hurry up! Get him in the truck!

683
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,465
- What if he comes?
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Get in.

684
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,593
Thanks.

685
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:31,143
Nathan!

686
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,896
- Okay. We made it.
- Yeah.

687
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:41,606
- What's wrong with the truck?
- Oh, no!

688
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:44,775
- Shit!
- The distributor cap.

689
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,452
- Alex, be careful.
- Yeah.

690
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,889
Hurry!

691
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,438
- Let me in!
- Hurry! Get in!

692
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,941
- Close the door!
- Roll up the window! Hurry!

693
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:28,235
- Roll it up! Roll it up!
- I'm rolling! I'm rolling!

694
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,739
Come on out and play, me friends!

695
00:57:38,412 --> 00:57:41,123
Get away! Get away!

696
00:57:42,124 --> 00:57:44,252
 No!

697
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,433
Come on!

698
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,640
Burn and die, you monster!

699
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:07,817
My... My ear! He... He got my ear!

700
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,813
Hey, chill!

701
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,866
What the heck is he doing in there?

702
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,172
Ring around the rosie,
a pocket full of posies

703
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,744
Faster! Faster!

704
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,138
No!

705
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:48,524
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down

706
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,333
Where'd you go, me friends?

707
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:09,170
I want to know where me gold is.

708
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:14,017
Give it back to a nice
little harmless leprechaun.

709
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,011
Okay. Let's go. Now.

710
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,850
Where is he?

711
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:25,525
Where are you going, me friends?

712
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:33,194
Hurry!

713
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:03,265
- What are we gonna do now?
- Phone.

714
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:06,727
- Phone. I gotta call for help.
- The phone is dead.

715
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:10,732
The phone is dead. Okay. My portable!

716
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:20,033
Hello? I need the police.
This is an emergency.

717
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:24,703
Yes. Hello. This is Tory Reding.
I'm calling from the O'Grady farm.

718
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:27,123
Um, something really
terrible has happened,

719
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,750
and we need you to send
someone out here right away.

720
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:33,963
Okay. Please hurry.
You've got... Hello?

721
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,674
Damn it! Okay. The battery died.

722
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:38,968
- Oh, no!
- It's okay.

723
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:41,846
I got through, and they're
gonna send somebody,

724
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:43,806
and we're gonna be okay.

725
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,891
It's gonna be fine.

726
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:49,862
Deputy Tripet, come in.
This is Sheriff Cronin.

727
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:54,151
Tripet, do you read me?

728
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,403
<i>I read you, Sheriff. Yeah, go ahead.</i>

729
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,655
Yeah, yeah, this is Sheriff Cronin.

730
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:05,244
We got a... a call from over
there at the O'Grady farm.

731
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:08,914
A female, name of Tory Reding,
called in an emergency.

732
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:12,042
Get out there on a code-one
priority right away.

733
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:14,628
Roger, Sheriff.

734
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:18,090
My ETA is less than three minutes.

735
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,635
- If I need backup, I'll call it in.
- Roger, Tripet.

736
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,387
You got the back door, right?

737
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,639
Right. And the basement
windows are locked up tight.

738
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,893
All right. Now double-check
the windows in the kitchen.

739
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,938
Oh, my ear sure hurts, Tory.

740
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:36,066
I bet that leprechaun
made a boot out of it.

741
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,861
You're gonna be okay, Ozzie.
He didn't get your ear.

742
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:42,114
- He just bit it.
- Where the hell are the police?

743
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,825
Well, they should be here by now.

744
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,543
Okay.

745
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:51,290
All right. Now, I'm gonna have to
make this a little tighter, okay?

746
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,958
Too tight?

747
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,085
No, it's all right. It's all right.

748
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,421
Boy, that leprechaun sure is mean.

749
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:00,674
It is not a leprechaun, damn it!

750
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:04,470
Ozzie, now, I admit I don't know
what the hell that thing was,

751
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,805
but it is not a leprechaun.

752
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,600
Do you understand?

753
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:13,520
Well, what about the
gold in the old rusty car?

754
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,983
Oh, ne-never mind what I just said.

755
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,985
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

756
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:23,035
What do you...
What do you mean, gold?

757
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,119
Alex.

758
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:33,332
Tell me, Alex. The gold?

759
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:37,294
We were gonna save it to get
Ozzie an operation to fix his brain.

760
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:41,049
Alex, you can't fix Ozzie's brain.

761
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:44,511
I know that, but he doesn't.

762
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:48,097
Okay. Okay. Tell me about the gold.

763
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:50,057
Okay. In the water bucket, right?

764
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:52,601
Right. Just pull it up,
and there's a bag of gold coins.

765
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,853
Okay. This has gotta work.

766
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:58,524
If all he wants is his gold,
he's gotta leave us alone.

767
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,901
- Let's go. Come on.
- No, no, no, no.

768
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,861
- No, you're hurt too bad.
- Come on.

769
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,698
- All right, all right.
- Sit down, Nathan.

770
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:08,909
- Okay, look, take this gun with you, okay?
- Okay.

771
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,370
Just cock it, aim it,
and pull the trigger.

772
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:12,955
Okay.

773
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,629
You ever work one of
those things before?

774
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,256
Nope.

775
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,644
Watch out for those teeth.

776
01:04:33,243 --> 01:04:36,589
God! Come on. Come on.

777
01:04:40,926 --> 01:04:44,004
- Is that me gold?
- What the hell are you?

778
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:46,632
I'm a leprechaun, me dear.

779
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:49,093
Here. This is what
you're looking for, right?

780
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:54,974
Me powers are returning.

781
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,913
It sounds like me gold.

782
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:06,083
It looks like me gold.

783
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,835
It smells like me gold.

784
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,914
It tastes like me gold.

785
01:05:21,144 --> 01:05:23,239
Oh, God!

786
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,921
Oh, God! Oh!

787
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,801
Me golden delicious gold.

788
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,888
Be calm. Be calm.

789
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:38,308
Okay. He took it.

790
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,227
Okay, so he got what he wanted.

791
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:43,313
Now we can get everybody to
the hospital and, call for help.

792
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,657
It's over.

793
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,529
94...

794
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,990
95...

795
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:55,017
96...

796
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,954
Oh! 97...

797
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,582
And 98...

798
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:03,960
and 99...

799
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:12,050
A missing coin.

800
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,928
I've been tricked.

801
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,764
They've got me coin!

802
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:22,019
No one takes a leprechaun's gold.

803
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:26,023
Oh, God. Alex, you gotta
get some ice for Ozzie's ear,

804
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,691
and boil up some water.

805
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,401
I'll cover you.

806
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:44,834
Put me down!

807
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,386
We're cooking now, kids.

808
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,055
Ozzie!

809
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:01,105
Okay. Over there.

810
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,519
Oh, God, he's in the cabinets.

811
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,397
Okay. Tory, I want you to open
it up and get back quickly, okay?

812
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:10,242
- Okay.
- Go.

813
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,738
God!

814
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,990
I want me gold!

815
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,492
- Quick!
- Okay.

816
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,788
Oh, God!

817
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:25,290
You should have picked
door number two, me lad.

818
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:29,426
Okay. Okay.

819
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,718
You missed me.

820
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,388
- Oh, my God!
- Where is he?

821
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:42,599
- You can never catch a leprechaun.
- There he goes!

822
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,017
Come on.

823
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:46,645
There he goes. He's getting away.

824
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,647
- Where the hell did he go?
- He went in there!

825
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:51,776
Alex, go stay with Ozzie.

826
01:07:59,224 --> 01:08:01,323
Come on.

827
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:15,049
Ho-ho-ho!

828
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:21,346
I'm right here, and I
ain't no Santa Claus.

829
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,351
We got the sucker!

830
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,902
Nathan, be careful.

831
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,541
You think it's dead?

832
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:55,422
Yeah. Yeah, he's dead.

833
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,676
Not a chance, me lads!

834
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:02,856
Fiddle-dee diddle-dee dee,
a leprechaun me

835
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:09,653
All right. Hang on. Hang on.

836
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,614
Okay. Okay.

837
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,992
Okay.

838
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:32,292
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

839
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:35,012
I don't know.

840
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,645
Oh, God!

841
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:50,602
Come on.

842
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,105
Okay, where the hell is he?

843
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:55,857
Wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.

844
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,110
Toward the basement.
Toward the basement!

845
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:01,071
No. Listen. Over here.

846
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,532
- Yeah, he's over there. I hear him.
- He's over there.

847
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,843
Wait. No. Listen.

848
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:08,912
All right. Okay, he's going
this way. Going this way.

849
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,580
- Right here.
- Okay.

850
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:13,417
Okay, come on, you little green
fucker, poke your head out.

851
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:15,544
- Come on, you little...
- Where is he?

852
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:20,173
- He went outside.
- He's gone.

853
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,676
- Crap.
- He's gone.

854
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:25,305
He's...

855
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:31,352
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

856
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:34,355
Do you hear anything?

857
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:45,282
He's going down in the basement!

858
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,160
Hello, hello! Help us, please!

859
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,370
Come help us!
We're trapped inside of here!

860
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,622
<i>Where's the rest of me gold?</i>

861
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,102
<i>Having problems?</i>

862
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,071
<i>Do you need a hand?</i>

863
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,611
God, I don't get what
the fuck's going on!

864
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,955
I gave him his gold!

865
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,241
I gave him his gold!

866
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:31,953
I... I think I know what he wants.

867
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,580
What?

868
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:37,210
He... He wants his last gold coin.

869
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,253
Stop him! He's got the last
gold coin in his stomach!

870
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:43,924
Ozzie, come on!
You can't go out there!

871
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:45,926
There's gotta be another way.

872
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:48,804
That thing is a leprechaun,
and we've gotta find a way to stop it!

873
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:52,474
Wait. Old man O'Grady.
He might know how to kill it.

874
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,768
- What?
- When I was a little kid,

875
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:58,230
he used to tell me stories
about fairies and leprechauns.

876
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:01,525
If anybody would know how
to kill this thing, he would.

877
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:04,945
He owned this house. He...
He probably put that thing in its crate.

878
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:07,405
- Well, where is he?
- Old man O'Grady

879
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:10,408
is in a rest home at the end of town.

880
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,702
He had a stroke about...
what... 10 years ago.

881
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:15,205
Well, then we gotta go there.
We gotta go there right now!

882
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:18,792
- How we gonna get there?
- The jeep. Okay...

883
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:21,341
Wait a sec. Wait. I got an idea.

884
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,511
Okay.

885
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:32,014
Alex, keep the door unlocked.

886
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:04,092
Okay. Okay. Okay.

887
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:10,162
Hello, love!

888
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,226
Farther! Come on!

889
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,525
Oh.

890
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:23,231
Oh, yeah.

891
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,700
Shiny, shiny.

892
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,737
Oh.

893
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:30,281
Good.

894
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:35,753
- Okay, Tory, we're clear.
- Okay. I'll be back.

895
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:44,507
Oh.

896
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:20,089
No! No! No!

897
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,779
Oh, God.

898
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:19,097
O'Grady, O'Grady.

899
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:20,975
Dan O'Grady.

900
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,359
Mr. O'Grady?

901
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,737
It's out. It's out of the crate.

902
01:16:57,738 --> 01:16:59,405
You believe it.

903
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:03,535
No one believed it was a leprechaun.

904
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:06,538
I believe it. How do we stop it?

905
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:08,540
There's only one way...

906
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:12,043
one way to kill a leprechaun...
but I'm not going to tell ya.

907
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,796
What?

908
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:17,967
I'll never tell ya!

909
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,810
Oh, my God! Oh!

910
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:37,485
No! Oh!

911
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:41,035
Oh, God! Oh!

912
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,304
Oh! Oh! Come on! Open, open, open!

913
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:02,302
Come on! Oh!

914
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:18,485
Oh, God. Oh...

915
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,488
No!

916
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:25,825
He came back for me.

917
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,702
I knew he would,

918
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:32,415
but no-nobody would believe me.

919
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:35,084
God, we've gotta get you down.

920
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:40,089
No. No. It's too...
too late for that now.

921
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:43,092
But you have to...
you have to kill it.

922
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:45,178
How? How can we kill it?

923
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:48,473
A four-leaf clover,

924
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:52,977
freshly plucked from the clover patch

925
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:55,563
beside the well.

926
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,399
You gotta put it on his body.

927
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,069
It has to touch him.

928
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:04,906
Then you can kill him.

929
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:06,324
Okay.

930
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,825
No...

931
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:51,495
No...

932
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:12,015
Little girls shouldn't look
for four-leaf clovers.

933
01:20:23,901 --> 01:20:25,728
Come to me, me dear.

934
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,459
Oh, G...

935
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:43,385
Oh, my God, a cop! Oh, my God, a cop!

936
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:50,136
Help! Please!

937
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:52,388
You gotta help us! Please help us!

938
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:56,351
Please! Please! Oh, my God!
You've gotta help us!

939
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:59,312
Oh, my God, no!

940
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:04,154
I want me gold!

941
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:11,923
Oh! No!

942
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:22,131
Oh, no! Get out! Please get out!

943
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:39,407
An eye for an eye, me dear.

944
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:44,857
Oh, please, please get out!

945
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,408
Tory!

946
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:55,660
- We heard your screams.
- Oh, my God.

947
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:58,037
- Where's Alex?
- He's okay. He's up in the house.

948
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:00,706
- He's safe.
- Okay. Oh, God. Okay.

949
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:02,625
O'Grady said that we need
to have a four-leaf clover.

950
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:04,335
A four-leaf clover will
kill the leprechaun.

951
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:06,629
We better get outta here
before that thing wakes up.

952
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:09,757
Okay. There's gotta be a four-leaf
clover in the patch up there.

953
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,509
- He said there was.
- Okay, come on. Let's go.

954
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,432
- Let's go.
- Okay.

955
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,059
Whoa, look at this, you guys!

956
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:22,687
We're never gonna find
a four-leaf clover in here.

957
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:25,737
Yes, we can. I found one
once when I was a kid.

958
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,206
- Hey!
- What?

959
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:37,034
Oh, never mind.

960
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,835
Oh, God, Ozzie!

961
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:46,127
I gotta get him.

962
01:22:47,828 --> 01:22:51,800
I'm not afraid.
I can get that leprechaun.

963
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,728
Please don't be here yet.

964
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:09,243
I know I can get him. I'm not afraid.

965
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:12,529
I'm gonna kill him.

966
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:16,240
I can get him. I can get him.

967
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,743
I'm not afraid.

968
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:37,261
Forget it. We're not gonna find it.

969
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:40,848
Y-You can, too, find it.
You just gotta believe.

970
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,600
Damn it, Ozzie!

971
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:46,437
I'm so sick of your magic
and your stupid fantasies!

972
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:49,190
Okay, it's too late for that now!
We don't have time

973
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:52,527
to sit here in a damn clover
patch and look for clovers!

974
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:56,280
- That thing is gonna wake up!
- You've lost your faith.

975
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:59,283
You gotta believe. You got to.

976
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:01,702
All right, Ozzie. Here. Look.
Here. Look.

977
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:04,501
I believe. I believe!

978
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:11,963
Look. You... You found one!

979
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:15,341
I told you. I told you!

980
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:16,884
Yes!

981
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,433
- We've gotta get this on the leprechaun!
- Yeah! Come on!

982
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,108
Top o' the morning, me lad!

983
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:35,903
- Please! Let go! Let go!
- Now I'll finish what I started.

984
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:39,740
- Get down!
- Help! Please!

985
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:43,244
Nathan! Ozzie! Please,
somebody help me!

986
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:47,498
He's gonna kill me!
Let go! Please, help!

987
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:49,917
No! It's me!

988
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,628
It's me you want, you little
green son of a bitch!

989
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:56,215
I've got the last gold coin.
I swallowed it. It's in my stomach.

990
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:59,337
Then it's your belly I want.

991
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:03,889
- Use the clover! Use the clover!
- How's your leg?

992
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:05,725
Are you okay?

993
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:08,603
- Wait! No!
- I gotta go see Ozzie!

994
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:11,106
Alex!

995
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:26,329
I want me last coin!

996
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:28,539
Me gold!

997
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:31,292
Hang on, Ozzie! I'll save you!
One second!

998
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:34,295
I'll save you! Hang on! Hey, lep!

999
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:39,759
Fuck you, Lucky Charms.

1000
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,009
We did it.

1001
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:27,056
I did a smart thing. I did
a smart thing, didn't I?

1002
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:29,266
You're really smart, Ozzie.

1003
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:31,519
You just hang in there, okay?

1004
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,900
Hey, Alex, what's that?

1005
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:41,153
Gotcha.

1006
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:43,239
First time I ever got ya.

1007
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,287
You sure did, Ozzie.

1008
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:55,126
I want me gold!

1009
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:57,925
Oh, Jesus.

1010
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:13,120
<i>I'll not rest till I have me gold.</i>

1011
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:16,332
<i>Curse this well
that me soul shall dwell</i>

1012
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:21,509
<i>till I find me magic
that breaks me spell.</i>
