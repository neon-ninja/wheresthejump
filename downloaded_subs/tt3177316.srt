1
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,273
I guess I'm the first one to do this.

2
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:25,912
Well, I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to say.

3
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:28,279
I'm now a wife.

4
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:33,481
Okay, wedding video.

5
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:36,397
Let me introduce you
to our delicious food.

6
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:41,425
We got veggie korma,
lamb curry, samosas.

7
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:46,200
Oh, I am sitting inside a tent of sorts,

8
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,306
because it is inside a tent similar
to this one where you proposed.

9
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:55,443
For our first date,
Bea chose an Indian restaurant,

10
00:00:55,543 --> 00:00:57,614
you know, one of those little
places on Sixth Street

11
00:00:57,714 --> 00:01:01,450
with the colored lights
and the fiber-optic lamps.

12
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:04,553
Yum, except that
halfway through the meal,

13
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:09,926
I start feeling my stomach gurgle in
this horrible food-poisoning-type way,

14
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:11,429
and I didn't even
have time to lie to her.

15
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:14,165
I spend 20 minutes in the
dirty restaurant toilet

16
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:16,801
and the rest of the night
on Bea's bathroom floor,

17
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:20,339
because I couldn't make it to
the subway, let alone Brooklyn.

18
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,441
Well, we'd been planning on
going camping upstate for weeks,

19
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:26,547
but, as you know, I got sick,

20
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:29,115
so we couldn't go.

21
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:33,855
I thought you were upset,
because you were acting really weird,

22
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:36,670
but then you... you built, like,

23
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,529
this tent over our bed out of blankets,

24
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:43,166
and we made s'mores on the stove,

25
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:46,868
and then inside the fort
on our bed, you said,

26
00:01:47,168 --> 00:01:50,874
"Bea, this was supposed to be romantic"

27
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:54,794
"and under the stars, not sheets,"

28
00:01:54,946 --> 00:01:57,880
"but you make me the happiest.

29
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,548
Will you marry me?"

30
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:04,219
And now we're married.

31
00:02:06,922 --> 00:02:08,267
So this,

32
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:11,195
this is our, "Fuck you, Indian food."

33
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,164
You tried to keep us apart,

34
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,235
but fuck you.

35
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,475
We win.

36
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,909
So we didn't get a regular wedding cake.

37
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,645
We decided on something that
was special for us instead.

38
00:02:25,747 --> 00:02:28,681
- Special and cheap.
- What?

39
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,420
No, I think some people
are annoyed by no cake.

40
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:36,756
Who cares? It's our wedding.

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,974
Before, I was alone, but now I'm not.

42
00:02:53,177 --> 00:02:55,612
I love you, honeybee.

43
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:20,975
It's not fancy. Is it okay?

44
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,451
Do you like it?

45
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,850
Here's what I see...

46
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,885
not the city,

47
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:33,022
woods.

48
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:36,859
- I just want it to be perfect.
- And I just want to be with you.

49
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:39,622
All right, come on.

50
00:03:40,463 --> 00:03:43,099
So this is the famous family cottage.

51
00:03:57,115 --> 00:04:00,153
- Wait, wait, wait. Not so fast, okay?
- What? What? What? What?

52
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:02,922
First, the grand tour.

53
00:04:03,022 --> 00:04:05,760
So this is the living room.
Watch your step.

54
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,295
You may notice a slight tilt.

55
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:11,933
- This is definitely unsafe.
- Oh, yeah? Well, you're unsafe.

56
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:14,467
- You're unsafe.
- You're unsafe.

57
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:21,042
Here we have a TV and VCR from 1991.

58
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:24,589
Well, I mean, who needs
cell service or Internet

59
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:29,195
when you can keep busy watching
your favourite VHS tape?

60
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:33,324
Over here, we have the kitchen,

61
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:37,429
complete with, yes,
a radioactive microwave

62
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:41,565
and an oven that probably
still uses hot coals.

63
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,918
- You may be noticing a theme.
- I want to have sex with you.

64
00:04:46,304 --> 00:04:48,438
Change is bad.

65
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:54,147
- Looks like a sign.
- No, looks like bad wiring.

66
00:04:56,347 --> 00:04:58,663
This is the bear room.

67
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,922
- Very good.
- Yeah.

68
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:02,721
And...

69
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:06,292
- why is it called the bear room?
- No.

70
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:09,729
This is the bathroom.

71
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,662
It's green,

72
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:13,850
very green.

73
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,407
This is... This is where you
almost drowned playing submarine.

74
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:21,810
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

75
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:24,745
You're my favourite.

76
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:51,778
- Which one is ours?
- Next door.

77
00:05:53,414 --> 00:05:54,425
The woods room...

78
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:57,251
- All right.
- ...because it has windows

79
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:59,052
facing...

80
00:05:59,954 --> 00:06:01,588
the woods.

81
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:41,067
- It's dark and scary out there.
- It's dark and scary in here.

82
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:46,505
- What's with the ducks?
- They're fake and hollow, empty inside.

83
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,511
I used to hide things in
'em with I was little.

84
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:53,546
- Yeah.
- What are you hiding under here?

85
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:57,148
My very super-special
honeymoon nightgown.

86
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:05,424
I love you, honeybee.

87
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,907
Sorry. Sorry.

88
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:50,245
- You are pretty creepo.
- I was done sleeping.

89
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:53,080
Look what I found.

90
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,430
"Dear ducks,
my name is Mallard P. Quack.

91
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,465
"I am not a real duck. Stay away.

92
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:13,905
"Translation: Quack, quack.
Honk, quack, quack, quack, honk."

93
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,141
Did we get milk?

94
00:08:19,246 --> 00:08:22,247
- You put it in here, right?
- Yeah, no, it's in the fridge.

95
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:26,653
Now, then... Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

96
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:29,724
- Wife...
- Oh, how gracious of you, husband.

97
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:35,430
After last night, you deserve to relax.

98
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,565
Rest your womb.

99
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,612
What, my womb?

100
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:42,436
Yeah.

101
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:46,109
- Why did you say that?
- I don't know. I don't know. I'm...

102
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:48,177
I didn't mean anything.

103
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,619
I'm gonna make the pancakes now.

104
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:56,485
- It's just...
- What?

105
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:59,623
- Well, I don't know.
- Just say it. What?

106
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:02,088
Do you want to have a baby?

107
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:07,296
No. What? No. I don't
know why I said, "Womb."

108
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:11,521
I was... I was just teasing
about how hard I fucked you.

109
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,871
Okay?

110
00:09:16,743 --> 00:09:18,243
All right.

111
00:09:32,728 --> 00:09:34,461
What is it?

112
00:09:36,463 --> 00:09:39,870
- I don't know.
- Okay. Cool.

113
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,705
Wait. I don't know if
I'm ready to have a baby.

114
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:44,706
I don't know if I'm
ready to have a baby.

115
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:48,312
We're gonna have breakfast together

116
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:51,943
every day for the rest of our lives.

117
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,451
I know. I know.

118
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:57,348
Which means we got plenty of
time to talk about your womb

119
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:59,587
and other married-people things.

120
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:01,725
Right now,

121
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:05,663
I think we should just be
on our honeymoon. Right?

122
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:07,865
Right.

123
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,137
Okay.

124
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:13,052
Pancakes. Pancakes.

125
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:19,413
You ready?

126
00:10:19,514 --> 00:10:21,648
This thing's massive.

127
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:23,818
- Where'd it come from?
- My dad.

128
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:28,291
I didn't realise he was
that kind of hunter.

129
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:32,954
- Well, what kind of hunter is that?
- The kind that kills giant fucking bears.

130
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:36,630
You ever killed anything?

131
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:42,940
- Rats.
- Yeah, murder by trap doesn't count.

132
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,708
I mean with your bare hands.

133
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:47,545
- Oh, with my bare hands?
- Yeah.

134
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:50,813
Have you?

135
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:55,119
No. No. I mean, just fish.

136
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:57,990
- I guess a few frogs.
- What?

137
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,829
Oh, when I was little. We'd use 'em
as bait, like little, mini baby ones.

138
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,517
- Oh, right. The little baby ones.
- Yeah, baby ones.

139
00:11:04,617 --> 00:11:07,401
- Is that normal?
- Oh, they scream when you cast them.

140
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,133
Oh, my God. Who are you?

141
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,110
Come on.

142
00:12:02,862 --> 00:12:03,665
What?

143
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,401
What, should we grab your
water wings, too, Pauly Poo?

144
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:10,304
I'm really not embarrassed by wanting
a little extra security on the water.

145
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:12,841
Here.

146
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:55,522
You tied it, right?

147
00:12:55,723 --> 00:12:57,126
- Tied what?
- The anchor.

148
00:12:57,226 --> 00:13:00,463
- You tied the rope before you dropped it, right?
- Didn't you just tell me to drop it in?

149
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,298
You're good at that.

150
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,172
12 years of Girl Scouts.

151
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:14,709
- Last one in the water's a rotten egg.
- What are you talking about?

152
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,016
Well, if you're afraid, you can
just stay in the boat like a baby.

153
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:21,696
I'm not afraid of the lake.

154
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:24,153
Fine.

155
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,636
Take off your shirt.

156
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:29,124
All right.

157
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:35,768
- No. No, this...
- No.

158
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:37,270
- Why not? Come on.
- No.

159
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:40,507
I'm sorry. I seem to
remember someone saying,

160
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:42,208
"Oh, and it's gonna
be just before summer,

161
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:44,646
"so we're totally gonna have
the whole lake to ourselves,

162
00:13:44,746 --> 00:13:46,081
- and there'll be no one around..."
- Shut up!

163
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:47,983
And... oh, shit.

164
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:50,718
Yep. No one around.

165
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:54,274
Hello! Yeah, looks like no one's around.

166
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:57,993
Yeah, well, I... I'll take this
under consideration. Okay?

167
00:13:59,574 --> 00:14:02,815
- What?
- Oh, it's so cold. It's freezing.

168
00:14:02,915 --> 00:14:07,302
Freezing? I thought something
had snapped... "Oh, my goodness!"

169
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:08,703
"Oh, my goodness"?

170
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:12,442
Oh, my God, did your womb get cold?

171
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:17,880
No, but it did freeze my big, giant...

172
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,409
- balls.
- No, Paul. No.

173
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:22,285
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- No, no, no.

174
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:24,690
- No, Paul. No, no.
- One...

175
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,293
- Two...
- No, no, no!

176
00:14:26,393 --> 00:14:27,110
Three!

177
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:38,239
I really wanted to go swimming with you.

178
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,339
I really wanted to go
skinny-dipping with you.

179
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:32,422
- I'm hungry.
- Oh, weird. I feel kind of full.

180
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:36,101
You're a dirty girl.

181
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:41,392
You are a dirty girl who deserves...

182
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,143
to be punished.

183
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:48,763
Paul. Paul, stop. Stop.

184
00:16:00,564 --> 00:16:01,965
This it?

185
00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:04,902
- Catchy name.
- Yeah. Their specialty is food.

186
00:16:05,604 --> 00:16:06,871
Last one is a rotten egg.

187
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:19,686
They even open?

188
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:22,523
They should be.

189
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:29,465
We're closed.

190
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:37,873
- W-We're closed!
- Yeah, okay, buddy. We got it.

191
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:40,108
We're leaving.

192
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,926
Trixie?

193
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:48,538
Trixie, it's me.

194
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:52,348
It's Will.

195
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:57,927
Holy... Will.

196
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:01,833
My God, I haven't seen you in forever.

197
00:17:02,757 --> 00:17:04,236
- Yeah.
- Will.

198
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:06,605
God, you look...

199
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,560
<i>Merci. Merci.</i>

200
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:16,183
- This is my... Paul, my husband Paul.
- Hey.

201
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:21,790
I've been building up the
maple beans here for years.

202
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,425
When did you start working here?

203
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:27,293
Actually, it's my wife,

204
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:31,633
Annie's family's place.
Annie's family owns it.

205
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,669
That's great.

206
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,071
Yeah.

207
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:39,306
Sorry about that before.

208
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:42,046
Oh, Will...

209
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:44,347
Everything's broken around here.

210
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:47,821
Still wearing this old thing?

211
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:51,723
Oh, yeah, despite Annie's best efforts.

212
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:54,592
She'll have to pry it
off my cold, dead head.

213
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:57,431
Oh, Will used to be a
great hockey player.

214
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:59,498
Hey, still am.

215
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:02,239
That's the one with
the ice skates, right?

216
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:09,684
Well, let me see if I can
rustle us up some grub.

217
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:13,014
- Annie.
- You should leave.

218
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:15,619
- They're leaving.
- You should leave.

219
00:18:16,818 --> 00:18:18,710
They're leaving.

220
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:23,352
Annie's not feeling so well.

221
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:26,963
Not quite yourself today,
are you, Annie?

222
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:31,410
Well, let me go grab those beans,

223
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:34,789
maybe some cheese curds
for old time's sake.

224
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:37,946
Can't believe you're here.

225
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:46,037
There's that smile.

226
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:16,384
Your husband is waking up early to
catch his wifey a delicious dinner.

227
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,416
Really?

228
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,463
You're not even gonna question that?

229
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:28,997
No, I... That sounds great.

230
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,472
I was just thinking.

231
00:19:33,902 --> 00:19:35,736
About...

232
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,984
I don't know.

233
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,982
- Nothing.
- Your ex-lover.

234
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:47,589
He wa... He was a summer
friend when I was a kid.

235
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:49,358
Oh, really?

236
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:51,859
Trixie...

237
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,442
a friend?

238
00:19:59,368 --> 00:20:01,580
That woman was just so...

239
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,435
Wait. Are you calling
his wife, "that woman"?

240
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:08,978
What? She seemed completely
out of it, like not normal.

241
00:20:09,078 --> 00:20:10,777
Yeah, probably because that woman

242
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,451
has had enough of the "I can kill a
bear with my bare hands" bullshit.

243
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:15,264
Well, he's just a little intense.

244
00:20:15,368 --> 00:20:19,022
Yeah, a little intense,
like a fucking maniac.

245
00:20:19,422 --> 00:20:21,994
Hey, in the five minutes we
were there, he smashed a lamp.

246
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:26,272
- Yeah, well, he's not like that. I know him.
- And put his wife's arm in a vice grip.

247
00:20:27,365 --> 00:20:30,220
She obviously did something awful.

248
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,456
Are you defending him? Do you miss him?

249
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:36,576
What, just 'cause he's a
little more alpha than you?

250
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,136
- You love him.
- Well, I can't help it.

251
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:43,847
His tiny, sexy, 13-year-old...

252
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:56,946
I'm not like him.

253
00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:00,599
You're not like her.

254
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:04,062
We aren't like them.

255
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,741
I know.

256
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,972
We're the best.

257
00:21:46,663 --> 00:21:48,264
Get it.

258
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:13,024
I'm gonna catch you a giant fish...

259
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:17,915
with my bare hands.

260
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:48,823
Shit.

261
00:23:21,561 --> 00:23:23,909
My alarm went off early.

262
00:23:26,918 --> 00:23:29,262
The power must have gone out.

263
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,911
Bea?

264
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,568
Are you peeing?

265
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:47,064
Are you ignoring me?

266
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,028
Bea?

267
00:23:57,238 --> 00:23:59,308
This isn't funny.

268
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,127
Come on.

269
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:15,127
Fine.

270
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:17,928
Keep hiding.

271
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:20,759
I'm going back to sleep.

272
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,175
Bea?

273
00:25:18,377 --> 00:25:20,026
Bea?!

274
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,073
Bea?

275
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:43,637
Bea?!

276
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,985
Please!

277
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,744
This isn't funny!

278
00:26:06,546 --> 00:26:07,381
Come on!

279
00:26:23,356 --> 00:26:24,992
Bea?

280
00:26:39,068 --> 00:26:40,846
Bea!

281
00:26:47,163 --> 00:26:48,171
Bea!

282
00:27:08,433 --> 00:27:09,445
Bea?

283
00:27:49,078 --> 00:27:50,930
- You okay?
- Yeah.

284
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:56,506
- What happened?
- Nothing. I don't know.

285
00:27:56,606 --> 00:27:59,510
- What happened?
- Nothing. I'm okay.

286
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,012
- Your skin is... is so cold.
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

287
00:28:02,112 --> 00:28:05,317
- You... You feel so...
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

288
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,737
Where's your... Where's your nightgown?

289
00:28:10,353 --> 00:28:13,526
- Where's your... Where's your...
- Paul, stop. Come here.

290
00:28:14,387 --> 00:28:16,036
- Paul, come here.
- I couldn't find you.

291
00:28:16,136 --> 00:28:18,563
Come here. Please come here.
Please come here.

292
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:19,698
- Come here.
- Okay.

293
00:28:19,871 --> 00:28:22,069
Honey, look.

294
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:24,707
I mean, I'm just cold.

295
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:26,539
Okay.

296
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,652
- Okay.
- You're okay.

297
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:32,889
- We're okay. Why? No.
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

298
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:36,217
I didn't mean to scare you.
I... I didn't.

299
00:28:39,453 --> 00:28:43,091
- You... you must have been...
- I must be sleepwalking.

300
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:45,694
Sleepwalking. Okay.

301
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:49,208
- Yeah.
- Okay.

302
00:28:53,437 --> 00:28:55,161
It's okay.

303
00:28:56,271 --> 00:29:00,483
I thought... I thought...
I thought something bad had...

304
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,255
I'm fine.

305
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:54,868
How's my little zombie
face this morning?

306
00:29:58,041 --> 00:30:01,178
- I'm serious.
- I'm fine.

307
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:05,852
- What you making?
- French toast.

308
00:30:05,952 --> 00:30:10,203
Oh, good. Obviously not as
good as my pancakes, but good.

309
00:30:11,358 --> 00:30:13,126
What's that smell?

310
00:30:15,629 --> 00:30:18,098
- These... These are burning.
- What?

311
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:20,397
This bread isn't battered.

312
00:30:20,497 --> 00:30:23,514
- What are you talking about?
- You forgot to batter the bread.

313
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:26,062
- No, I didn't. It...
- Yes, you did.

314
00:30:26,162 --> 00:30:28,948
That's the whole point of...
of French toast. You batter the bread.

315
00:30:31,145 --> 00:30:35,205
- All right, you okay here?
- Yeah. No, I'm f...

316
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:38,989
I'm just feeling a little funny.
That's all.

317
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:42,445
- Funny? Like how?
- I don't know.

318
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:44,495
- We should go into town.
- No, no, I'm fine.

319
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:46,464
- Gotta be, like, a doctor or something or...
- No, don't be crazy.

320
00:30:46,564 --> 00:30:49,602
We've spent hundreds of nights together,
and you've never been a sleepwalker.

321
00:30:50,102 --> 00:30:51,102
I'm just tired.

322
00:30:51,202 --> 00:30:53,272
You've never forgotten
how to make French toast.

323
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:55,250
I promise.

324
00:30:56,142 --> 00:30:57,943
I promise.

325
00:31:01,915 --> 00:31:03,449
Okay.

326
00:31:05,786 --> 00:31:07,153
So...

327
00:31:07,554 --> 00:31:09,056
bit of milk.

328
00:31:09,657 --> 00:31:11,327
That's an egg.

329
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:13,164
Shut up.

330
00:31:14,195 --> 00:31:18,065
- Now for the cinnamon...
- Okay, I got it. I got it. Got it.

331
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:20,933
Well, I made the coffee.

332
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:26,275
Well, I thought today, maybe, if you're
up for it, we could go out onto...

333
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:27,977
What is it?

334
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,728
What is it?

335
00:32:03,284 --> 00:32:06,819
- What are you doing?
- Look at this fatty one.

336
00:32:12,794 --> 00:32:15,796
This big, fatty one is
gonna be our dinner.

337
00:32:18,865 --> 00:32:20,632
Why aren't you laughing?

338
00:32:21,703 --> 00:32:23,203
I don't know.

339
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:26,878
You want to go back?

340
00:32:28,244 --> 00:32:30,777
No. No.

341
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:41,058
Thought you would find that funny,
as a frog killer.

342
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,533
Hey. Froggy Krueger. Yo.

343
00:32:59,513 --> 00:33:00,449
Let's go swimming.

344
00:33:02,618 --> 00:33:06,944
- That's funny. You're funny.
- Last one in's a rotten egg!

345
00:33:29,914 --> 00:33:31,522
How's it going?

346
00:33:33,084 --> 00:33:35,018
How's it going with you?

347
00:33:38,355 --> 00:33:40,956
Did you rinse off all
the creepy-crawlies?

348
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:50,038
Why'd you do that?
You knew the water was cold.

349
00:33:50,438 --> 00:33:52,273
I don't know.

350
00:33:53,774 --> 00:33:55,574
I thought it'd be funny.

351
00:34:13,312 --> 00:34:15,238
I'm sorry.

352
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,970
- What's going on with you?
- I'm tired.

353
00:34:20,071 --> 00:34:22,941
The drive, the wedding,

354
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,078
stress of everything
is catching up to me.

355
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:29,416
- The wedding?
- Oh, I... No, I was just saying...

356
00:34:30,282 --> 00:34:35,589
- You wanted to get married.
- Yeah. Yes. Yes. That's all I want.

357
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:41,494
- I just want to make you happy.
- You do. I promise.

358
00:35:00,004 --> 00:35:01,476
Paul.

359
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:07,792
- Paul. Paul.
- What's this?

360
00:35:08,092 --> 00:35:09,627
- What?
- What are these?

361
00:35:10,628 --> 00:35:14,505
- What is this? Bea.
- Jesus. They're mosquito bites.

362
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:16,635
I know what a fucking
mosquito bite looks like.

363
00:35:16,735 --> 00:35:18,959
W-Way to get me in the mood.

364
00:35:19,804 --> 00:35:21,304
Okay.

365
00:35:22,008 --> 00:35:24,239
Okay, I just...

366
00:35:27,246 --> 00:35:31,251
Do you think something maybe bit you...
when you were sleepwalking?

367
00:35:31,351 --> 00:35:34,622
Yeah. Yeah, no, I think you're right.
I think something bit me.

368
00:35:34,722 --> 00:35:36,793
- You do?
- Yes, mosquitoes.

369
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:38,759
Don't get upset. I'm worried.

370
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:41,697
I'm tired, okay? I think I'm
just gonna go take a sleep.

371
00:35:41,897 --> 00:35:45,333
- What?
- I'm just gonna go take a nap.

372
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,652
Bea.

373
00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:08,694
Oh, I...

374
00:38:10,632 --> 00:38:13,202
I kind of have a headache.

375
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,868
Oh, I feel like we should...

376
00:38:18,222 --> 00:38:20,712
I feel like we should get
a good night's sleep.

377
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:24,676
I'm just not really in the mood.

378
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:29,927
Oh, I don't know. I took
some Advil, but this hea...

379
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:33,151
I don't know.

380
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,907
I don't know. I took some Tylenol,
but this headache won't go away.

381
00:38:39,196 --> 00:38:40,463
I can't help it.

382
00:38:41,365 --> 00:38:43,618
My tummy hurts.

383
00:38:46,405 --> 00:38:49,785
My stomach just feels icky.

384
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:52,044
Icky.

385
00:38:54,443 --> 00:38:55,923
Icky.

386
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:06,728
Hey, there.

387
00:39:07,528 --> 00:39:08,687
Hey.

388
00:40:23,449 --> 00:40:25,016
Trade you.

389
00:40:29,154 --> 00:40:31,455
Two of a kind.

390
00:40:31,957 --> 00:40:34,991
Some people might call it a pair.

391
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:44,136
- Small straight.
- I'll take that as my chance.

392
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:47,406
You're my chance.

393
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:55,481
I want to kiss you.

394
00:40:57,382 --> 00:40:59,524
I want to kiss you.

395
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,540
You're gonna kill me.

396
00:41:30,424 --> 00:41:32,458
What? What is it?

397
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,162
Oh, I kind of have a headache.

398
00:41:35,962 --> 00:41:39,966
Oh, I took some Tylenol,
but this headache won't go away.

399
00:41:47,343 --> 00:41:49,879
- Are you mad?
- No.

400
00:41:53,983 --> 00:41:55,484
No.

401
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:05,392
Are you trying to not have sex with me?

402
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:07,503
What?

403
00:42:07,603 --> 00:42:11,169
- Are you avoiding sleeping with me?
- You're acting crazy.

404
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,572
- I'm your husband.
- And I'm your wife.

405
00:42:15,674 --> 00:42:17,243
- We talk to each other.
- I know that.

406
00:42:17,343 --> 00:42:20,712
- You can tell me if...
- My head hurts.

407
00:42:23,213 --> 00:42:26,419
- Did something happen in the woods?
- I was sleepwalking.

408
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:31,670
You feel distant.

409
00:42:33,192 --> 00:42:35,493
You feel different.

410
00:42:37,464 --> 00:42:39,664
You feel distracted.

411
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:55,352
Bea.

412
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:57,354
Bea.

413
00:42:59,555 --> 00:43:01,899
I want to make you happy.

414
00:43:04,396 --> 00:43:06,666
Put on your nightgown.

415
00:43:06,766 --> 00:43:09,646
What? What are you talking about?

416
00:43:10,535 --> 00:43:13,515
Your special honeymoon nightgown.

417
00:43:14,307 --> 00:43:16,611
- Why?
- I want to see it on you.

418
00:43:16,711 --> 00:43:19,445
- Come on. Put it on.
- No.

419
00:43:19,546 --> 00:43:21,091
Why not?

420
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:25,058
Are you really doing this right now?

421
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,687
It looks sexy.

422
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,926
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

423
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:35,797
I put it away. It's put away
with my dirty laundry.

424
00:43:36,298 --> 00:43:39,336
It's in the box, the clothes bo...
the suitcase.

425
00:43:39,436 --> 00:43:42,356
It's in the suitcase. It's in the
suitcase with my dirty laundry.

426
00:43:46,576 --> 00:43:48,444
What, do you really
want me to go get it?

427
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:54,585
No.

428
00:45:16,151 --> 00:45:17,211
Where'd you go?

429
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,815
I was getting a drink.

430
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,065
- Are you staying there?
- Where's your glass?

431
00:48:27,461 --> 00:48:29,295
What are you doing?

432
00:48:30,196 --> 00:48:31,832
- Went outside.
- You can't do that.

433
00:48:31,932 --> 00:48:34,168
We're in the middle of nowhere.
You don't know what's out there.

434
00:48:34,268 --> 00:48:37,772
- Someone was out there.
- What are you talking about?

435
00:48:37,872 --> 00:48:41,408
Looking in our windows,
playing some little game,

436
00:48:41,509 --> 00:48:44,146
shining some high-beam flashlight
in your face while you sleep.

437
00:48:44,246 --> 00:48:46,481
- No.
- Yes.

438
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,484
Yes.

439
00:48:48,784 --> 00:48:53,357
- I took a walk in the woods earlier.
- What does that have to do with anything?

440
00:48:53,557 --> 00:48:57,627
- Where you were sleepwalking.
- Why would you go ba...

441
00:48:59,427 --> 00:49:01,027
Why are you lying to me?

442
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:07,203
I was sleepwalking. I'm confused.

443
00:49:07,305 --> 00:49:09,173
I found footprints.

444
00:49:10,074 --> 00:49:12,276
- It was muddy.
- They weren't ours.

445
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:15,660
I know someone was in the woods with you,
and I know someone was just outside,

446
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,150
- looking in our windows.
- No.

447
00:49:20,852 --> 00:49:22,558
This is me...

448
00:49:22,658 --> 00:49:26,391
standing here. Okay? It's me.

449
00:49:27,894 --> 00:49:29,661
I love you.

450
00:49:31,628 --> 00:49:34,046
I love you so much,

451
00:49:34,146 --> 00:49:36,696
but I... I need you to talk to me.

452
00:49:38,271 --> 00:49:40,305
Did you meet him?

453
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:45,414
What? Who?

454
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:47,916
Will.

455
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,754
- What?
- I just want to know what happened.

456
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:53,192
- I just want you to tell me...
- What do you want me to tell you?

457
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:57,596
I get it. Maybe he wanted to meet,
and y-you just thought,

458
00:49:57,696 --> 00:50:00,196
you know, like...
like, you were kids again.

459
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:03,904
Please, I know it's not your fault.
I saw him yelling at his wife.

460
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:06,973
- I saw the way he looked at you.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

461
00:50:07,073 --> 00:50:09,409
- Did he do something to you?
- Stop it.

462
00:50:09,509 --> 00:50:10,744
- Did he hurt you?
- Stop it.

463
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:13,947
- I'm worried.
- You're acting crazy. Why are you doing this?

464
00:50:14,047 --> 00:50:16,693
- Because I want to protect you.
- It wasn't Will! Okay?!

465
00:50:16,793 --> 00:50:19,320
- You have to stop!
- He was looking in our windows!

466
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:23,490
- You probably saw a boat or the moon.
- It wasn't the fucking moon!

467
00:50:27,997 --> 00:50:30,232
You have to stop.

468
00:50:34,303 --> 00:50:37,072
You're ruining this.

469
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:41,008
You're ruining our time together.

470
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:25,961
- Morning.
- Morning.

471
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,330
What are you doing?

472
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:35,139
- What is this?
- Nothing.

473
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,620
Doesn't look like nothing.

474
00:52:49,186 --> 00:52:50,521
What are you doing?

475
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:53,459
Nothing.

476
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,398
- You want some help?
- No, I got it.

477
00:53:25,623 --> 00:53:27,563
Why did you do that?

478
00:53:29,062 --> 00:53:30,666
I don't know.

479
00:53:31,136 --> 00:53:33,204
They're just ants.

480
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:39,812
- How are the bug bites?
- Fine.

481
00:53:39,993 --> 00:53:41,928
Better.

482
00:53:42,615 --> 00:53:46,051
They don't look better. They look worse.

483
00:53:47,753 --> 00:53:49,887
Not really like bug
bites at all, in fact.

484
00:53:51,791 --> 00:53:53,458
I was just trying to be nice.

485
00:54:46,654 --> 00:54:48,156
Hi.

486
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:50,610
Hi.

487
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:18,924
They can live for up to
five minutes underwater.

488
00:55:41,584 --> 00:55:43,519
I want to leave.

489
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,253
What are you talking about?

490
00:55:48,755 --> 00:55:50,756
I want us to leave,

491
00:55:51,394 --> 00:55:53,654
for us to get out of here
and go back to the city.

492
00:55:55,164 --> 00:55:58,570
We're on our honeymoon.
Why would you say that?

493
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:02,339
Nothing's feeling right out here.
Everything feels different.

494
00:56:09,715 --> 00:56:13,186
- I don't want to fight.
- I don't want to fight with you. I just...

495
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:16,554
Last night was horrible.
Today was horrible.

496
00:56:16,654 --> 00:56:19,393
I don't want to sleep
without you ever again.

497
00:56:20,093 --> 00:56:21,227
I don't want to either.

498
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:26,435
I need you.

499
00:56:28,235 --> 00:56:30,905
I miss you. Miss you.

500
00:56:49,457 --> 00:56:51,210
Paul.

501
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:55,558
I'm fine.

502
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:05,611
This is a lot of blood.
This isn't normal. We need a doctor.

503
00:57:05,711 --> 00:57:08,883
- I'm not going to the doctor for my period.
- That's not what this is.

504
00:57:08,983 --> 00:57:11,584
- It's not?
- No.

505
00:57:12,085 --> 00:57:14,920
I sat there while you
marked the calendar

506
00:57:15,022 --> 00:57:19,126
and counted the days so we
didn't have to deal with it now.

507
00:57:20,627 --> 00:57:22,732
- Enough of this.
- Of what? Of me?

508
00:57:22,832 --> 00:57:26,643
You've got bruises on your thighs.
You're bleeding.

509
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:28,862
Why are you bleeding?

510
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:33,376
- We're not staying here.
- Paul, please calm down, okay?

511
00:57:33,476 --> 00:57:37,613
Pack your bags. When I come back,
we're leaving, okay?

512
00:57:37,713 --> 00:57:40,151
- We're gonna get you help.
- Where are you going?

513
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:43,085
I can't help you if I don't
know what happened.

514
00:57:45,854 --> 00:57:47,267
Okay?

515
00:57:47,367 --> 00:57:50,428
If you won't tell me, I'll ask him.

516
00:57:50,629 --> 00:57:52,128
Paul.

517
00:57:52,464 --> 00:57:54,724
Paul! Paul!

518
00:58:09,149 --> 00:58:13,687
Excuse me. Hi. I was here the other night.
My wife knows your husband.

519
00:58:14,588 --> 00:58:18,146
I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Let me help you.

520
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:21,248
My name is Annie.

521
00:58:21,864 --> 00:58:24,165
Right. I'm Paul.

522
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:27,770
- My husband is Will.
- Yeah. Is he around?

523
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:30,071
Can you get him for me?

524
00:58:31,793 --> 00:58:33,807
Will's not here.

525
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:36,612
Where is he?

526
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:39,148
He's hiding.

527
00:58:46,658 --> 00:58:49,378
What happened... happened to your legs?

528
00:58:50,328 --> 00:58:52,328
How did you get those
marks on your legs?

529
00:58:52,702 --> 00:58:55,736
- Did he do this to you?
- You should stay away from us.

530
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:58,972
- I can help you.
- We're not safe.

531
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:01,409
We will hurt you.

532
01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:06,014
Hello.

533
01:00:11,854 --> 01:00:13,222
Hello?

534
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:21,202
Paul.

535
01:03:22,403 --> 01:03:25,239
Paul. Paul.

536
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,440
Paul. Paul, what are you do...

537
01:03:30,511 --> 01:03:33,451
What the... What the fuck is going on?

538
01:03:36,202 --> 01:03:37,825
Who are you?

539
01:03:38,021 --> 01:03:40,990
- What? Paul...
- Who are you?

540
01:03:41,491 --> 01:03:43,594
- What are you talking about?
- Answer me.

541
01:03:44,893 --> 01:03:46,663
- Please.
- Who are you?

542
01:03:48,794 --> 01:03:52,204
- Who are...
- Bea. My name is Bea.

543
01:03:52,404 --> 01:03:55,039
- Okay? You know that.
- Who am I?

544
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,975
- What? You're...
- Who am I?

545
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:02,282
My husband. You are my husband.

546
01:04:02,682 --> 01:04:04,483
What's my name?

547
01:04:05,184 --> 01:04:07,385
Go on. You just said it.

548
01:04:10,504 --> 01:04:11,900
My husband is Paul.

549
01:04:15,464 --> 01:04:19,199
- Go on.
- My home is New York.

550
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,434
I live in Brooklyn.

551
01:04:23,137 --> 01:04:27,305
448 Kent Street, Apartment 3B.

552
01:04:28,373 --> 01:04:32,623
My birthday is January 25, 1987.

553
01:04:34,215 --> 01:04:36,716
My favourite color is blue.

554
01:04:37,154 --> 01:04:38,423
- I'm allergic to hazelnuts.
- "Hazelnuts."

555
01:04:38,723 --> 01:04:41,259
- "I don't like the taste of ketchup."
- I don't like the taste of ketchup.

556
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:43,767
Why are you writing these things?

557
01:04:45,295 --> 01:04:47,095
These aren't things you memorize.

558
01:04:47,499 --> 01:04:49,367
This is you.

559
01:04:50,168 --> 01:04:51,969
This is Bea.

560
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:57,243
- Why are you writing these things?
- I don't know. I don't know.

561
01:05:00,278 --> 01:05:02,346
Talked to Will's wife.

562
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:04,252
- What?
- It's the same thing as this,

563
01:05:04,352 --> 01:05:06,901
the same thing as this,

564
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:09,658
page after page. "My name is Annie.

565
01:05:09,758 --> 01:05:12,844
My husband is Will. This is my home."

566
01:05:12,944 --> 01:05:16,199
- Why are you writing these things?
- Please. Please.

567
01:05:16,299 --> 01:05:19,836
Why are you doing the same thing
as a woman you barely know?

568
01:05:19,936 --> 01:05:22,471
- Please. Please, stop.
- Why do you have...

569
01:05:22,571 --> 01:05:25,257
- Why do you have the same marks on your legs?
- Stop. Stop. Stop.

570
01:05:25,357 --> 01:05:27,309
Stop it. I just... Stop it.

571
01:05:27,409 --> 01:05:30,829
Why are you both waking up
in the middle of the night?

572
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,580
Who's out there?

573
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,686
Who is shining the light?

574
01:05:35,786 --> 01:05:39,758
- Why did you go back there? Why?
- It wasn't Will.

575
01:05:40,709 --> 01:05:42,859
There was blood on Will's hat.

576
01:05:43,995 --> 01:05:47,295
There was blood on Will's hat.

577
01:05:47,767 --> 01:05:49,339
Yeah.

578
01:05:49,836 --> 01:05:50,804
What happened to him?

579
01:05:51,104 --> 01:05:53,606
- What did she do to him?
- Stop it.

580
01:05:53,707 --> 01:05:56,677
- What are you gonna do to me?
- I want to protect you.

581
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:12,360
Where are the car keys?

582
01:06:14,928 --> 01:06:15,830
Where...

583
01:06:17,366 --> 01:06:18,934
Where did you put the key?

584
01:06:34,353 --> 01:06:36,421
Where are the keys?!

585
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:39,890
Open up.

586
01:06:42,228 --> 01:06:43,843
Open up.

587
01:06:49,363 --> 01:06:50,568
Open up, Bea!

588
01:07:00,856 --> 01:07:02,166
Bea.

589
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:06,425
Go back to the bedroom.
You have to to back to the bedroom.

590
01:07:06,525 --> 01:07:08,725
- What are you doing? You're bleeding.
- Go back to the bedroom.

591
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:11,296
- Listen to me. Please don't do this to me now.
- What are you doing? You're bleeding.

592
01:07:11,396 --> 01:07:13,431
Go back... go back to the bedroom!

593
01:07:13,531 --> 01:07:16,301
- Why are you yelling?!
- Okay. Okay. We'll go back together.

594
01:07:16,401 --> 01:07:18,206
- What are you talking about?
- We'll go back together.

595
01:07:18,306 --> 01:07:20,893
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop saying that!
- Go back to the bedroom.

596
01:07:20,993 --> 01:07:22,585
- Tell me what's going on!
- I don't want to.

597
01:07:22,685 --> 01:07:25,143
- Tell me what's going on!
- I don't want to.

598
01:07:25,243 --> 01:07:27,447
- Talk to me!
- Stop!

599
01:07:27,547 --> 01:07:28,447
Bea!

600
01:07:29,148 --> 01:07:32,584
- Please come here. Please come here.
- Get up! Tell me what's going on!

601
01:07:35,054 --> 01:07:37,928
- Tell me what's going on.
- No.

602
01:07:38,328 --> 01:07:41,661
Tell me what's going on.
Tell me what's going on.

603
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:44,731
Why are you...
Why are you hurting yourself?

604
01:07:45,433 --> 01:07:47,309
You're scaring me.

605
01:07:48,769 --> 01:07:51,738
I love you. I love you, honeybee.

606
01:07:54,774 --> 01:07:56,693
I love you, honeybee.

607
01:07:57,312 --> 01:07:59,121
I love you, honeybee. What do you say?

608
01:08:00,182 --> 01:08:02,487
Answer me. I say that,
and then what do you say?

609
01:08:03,606 --> 01:08:05,655
We don't remember.

610
01:08:06,456 --> 01:08:08,426
- We don't remember.
- Why are you saying that?

611
01:08:08,926 --> 01:08:10,027
We don't remember what to say.

612
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:12,230
Why are you saying that?
What are you talking about?

613
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:15,767
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

614
01:08:16,368 --> 01:08:18,213
- No!
- Oh, fuck.

615
01:08:18,637 --> 01:08:22,001
No. Paul! Paul, no!

616
01:08:24,177 --> 01:08:25,946
- What are you doing? Stop.
- Talk to me!

617
01:08:26,046 --> 01:08:28,835
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Talk to me!

618
01:08:31,717 --> 01:08:33,385
- Don't...
- What are you...

619
01:08:34,722 --> 01:08:37,957
- Bea!
- No! No.

620
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:43,384
- No!
- Untie me! What are you doing?

621
01:08:48,193 --> 01:08:51,073
Stop it. Stop. What are you doing?

622
01:08:51,174 --> 01:08:53,475
- Paul, stop it!
- Stop it!

623
01:08:54,175 --> 01:08:56,042
- Stop it.
- Paul!

624
01:09:00,116 --> 01:09:01,651
Paul! Stop!

625
01:09:08,494 --> 01:09:10,126
Oh, God.

626
01:09:20,599 --> 01:09:22,207
I don't know...

627
01:09:22,509 --> 01:09:24,734
I don't know what's happening to you.

628
01:09:26,413 --> 01:09:28,948
I just want things to be normal.

629
01:09:30,318 --> 01:09:32,748
I just want us to be us.

630
01:09:38,093 --> 01:09:40,361
I just want us to be us.

631
01:09:57,816 --> 01:10:00,985
Why... why aren't you crying?

632
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:05,790
My wife cries.

633
01:10:10,731 --> 01:10:13,551
Then if I cry, will you let me go?

634
01:10:15,467 --> 01:10:18,168
My wife doesn't act like this.

635
01:10:20,339 --> 01:10:22,707
She tells me everything.

636
01:10:25,277 --> 01:10:27,545
She tells me the truth.

637
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,361
Where is my wife?

638
01:10:47,138 --> 01:10:49,105
I need her.

639
01:10:51,506 --> 01:10:53,708
It's me.

640
01:10:53,978 --> 01:10:56,206
I need her back.

641
01:11:00,086 --> 01:11:01,620
Wait.

642
01:11:12,533 --> 01:11:14,668
I am your wife.

643
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:17,071
How do I know that?

644
01:11:23,352 --> 01:11:25,481
How do you not know that?

645
01:11:40,664 --> 01:11:43,282
Where did we go on our first date?

646
01:11:44,201 --> 01:11:46,585
- I can't.
- Please.

647
01:11:46,685 --> 01:11:49,208
- I... I don't...
- Why not? Why can't you remember this?

648
01:11:49,308 --> 01:11:53,319
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

649
01:11:53,419 --> 01:11:55,948
We ate it, we...
we had it at the wedding.

650
01:11:56,649 --> 01:11:59,871
We ate it, we had it at the wedding.

651
01:11:59,971 --> 01:12:01,588
Four days ago.

652
01:12:03,196 --> 01:12:06,292
I'm sorry. I don't know.

653
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,455
How did I ask you to marry me?

654
01:12:14,904 --> 01:12:17,069
Where did I propose?

655
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:24,597
Where did I propose?

656
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:31,522
Camping.

657
01:12:32,623 --> 01:12:34,290
Tell me.

658
01:12:35,659 --> 01:12:37,966
We went camping.

659
01:12:39,162 --> 01:12:41,683
We made s'mores.

660
01:12:42,534 --> 01:12:44,783
Oh, and there were so many stars.

661
01:12:45,537 --> 01:12:49,241
We snuggled into our tent,
and you said to me... you said,

662
01:12:49,341 --> 01:12:53,877
"You make me the happiest.
Will you marry me?"

663
01:12:56,214 --> 01:12:58,882
That's right, right?

664
01:12:59,853 --> 01:13:00,953
Am I right?

665
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:06,169
But I... I remember.
It was so quiet and cold,

666
01:13:06,269 --> 01:13:08,797
- and there were so many stars.
- No.

667
01:13:09,999 --> 01:13:11,234
- No.
- That's what happened.

668
01:13:11,334 --> 01:13:12,853
No.

669
01:13:13,729 --> 01:13:15,707
You were sick.

670
01:13:16,746 --> 01:13:18,543
- No.
- We were on our bed.

671
01:13:18,643 --> 01:13:21,479
- I remember a tent.
- I made a tent on our bed.

672
01:13:21,579 --> 01:13:24,179
No, I... I remember the stars.

673
01:13:27,481 --> 01:13:30,159
- What happened to Bea?
- No, Paul, I knew...

674
01:13:30,259 --> 01:13:32,358
- I know it was on our bed.
- Where is she?

675
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:34,494
Okay, Paul, please, I knew that's how...

676
01:13:34,594 --> 01:13:36,646
- Where is Bea?
- It's me.

677
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:41,733
- Where is my wife?
- Stop saying that. Stop saying that.

678
01:13:42,135 --> 01:13:46,439
What has happened?
You look like her, but you're not her.

679
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:48,408
Please. I just forgot.

680
01:13:53,348 --> 01:13:55,683
You have her toes.

681
01:13:56,185 --> 01:13:58,153
You have her toes.

682
01:14:09,633 --> 01:14:11,900
You have her knees.

683
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,980
- You have her thighs.
- It's me.

684
01:14:26,185 --> 01:14:28,519
You smell the same.

685
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:38,898
You taste the same.

686
01:14:45,472 --> 01:14:48,710
- But you're different. You're different.
- No.

687
01:14:55,351 --> 01:14:57,351
How does this feel?

688
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:01,854
What does this feel like to you?

689
01:15:02,826 --> 01:15:04,919
It's me.

690
01:15:06,796 --> 01:15:08,496
Please.

691
01:15:22,682 --> 01:15:25,750
Please, help me.

692
01:15:27,619 --> 01:15:31,088
Help me. Take it out, please.

693
01:15:32,091 --> 01:15:33,191
Take it out.

694
01:15:53,453 --> 01:15:56,153
Don't stop. Don't stop.

695
01:15:56,253 --> 01:15:57,988
Don't...

696
01:16:12,898 --> 01:16:14,506
Paul, please.

697
01:16:15,207 --> 01:16:17,008
Please.

698
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:28,890
What is this?

699
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:35,763
- What is this?
- I couldn't tell you. I couldn't.

700
01:16:36,565 --> 01:16:38,749
- What is this? Oh, fuck.
- I'm sorry.

701
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:40,336
- Paul.
- Oh, fuck.

702
01:16:40,436 --> 01:16:43,308
- That's it. This is...
- Paul. Paul!

703
01:16:53,618 --> 01:16:56,253
Something bad happened to me.

704
01:17:04,764 --> 01:17:08,399
Something bad happened
to me in the woods.

705
01:17:10,968 --> 01:17:13,069
There was a light.

706
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:17,740
I couldn't see, but...

707
01:17:19,012 --> 01:17:21,646
I could only see their dark...

708
01:17:22,716 --> 01:17:25,755
the outlines of their bodies,

709
01:17:25,855 --> 01:17:28,629
their dark bodies.

710
01:17:30,689 --> 01:17:32,457
They went inside me.

711
01:17:35,365 --> 01:17:37,999
And then they left, but...

712
01:17:39,001 --> 01:17:43,919
I couldn't see them anymore,
but I could still feel them...

713
01:17:45,152 --> 01:17:46,989
inside.

714
01:17:48,145 --> 01:17:49,713
I...

715
01:17:49,815 --> 01:17:52,633
I can still feel them...

716
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:55,033
inside.

717
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:57,474
They're with me,

718
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:00,962
and I know what they know,

719
01:18:01,509 --> 01:18:06,730
and I know what they want,
and I know what I'm supposed to do.

720
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:12,137
- I don't understand what you mean.
- I... I wanted to tell you.

721
01:18:12,237 --> 01:18:14,375
I wanted, but...

722
01:18:14,775 --> 01:18:16,375
I'm not allowed.

723
01:18:18,078 --> 01:18:19,445
I knew it was happening,

724
01:18:19,545 --> 01:18:23,153
and there was nothing I could do,
but I just wanted time.

725
01:18:23,253 --> 01:18:26,773
I just wanted these last few days.

726
01:18:27,691 --> 01:18:30,579
- What are you saying?
- I just wanted our honeymoon.

727
01:18:33,393 --> 01:18:36,695
My body is here, but I'm leaving.

728
01:18:37,135 --> 01:18:41,731
They're taking everything.
They're... they're taking me.

729
01:18:43,157 --> 01:18:44,733
Bea.

730
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:47,495
They're taking Bea.

731
01:18:47,995 --> 01:18:50,790
No, they're not. We need to get help.

732
01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:53,041
We need to leave.
Where did you put the keys?

733
01:18:53,419 --> 01:18:55,520
- No. No, you can't leave.
- Where are the keys?

734
01:18:55,822 --> 01:18:57,190
- Where are the keys?
- You don't understand.

735
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:59,628
- Where are the keys? Where are the keys?
- Okay, you don't understand. You can't leave.

736
01:18:59,728 --> 01:19:02,030
- Where did you put the keys?
- Paul, you can't leave.

737
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:04,108
- Where did you put the keys? You are sick.
- You can't leave.

738
01:19:04,208 --> 01:19:05,503
We need to leave. We need to go.

739
01:19:05,803 --> 01:19:08,977
No. No. No, no, no, no.
No, I remember now. I remember.

740
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:11,253
I couldn't before, but now I remember.

741
01:19:11,353 --> 01:19:14,628
We went for Indian food.
That was our first date.

742
01:19:14,728 --> 01:19:18,948
- We're okay. We're okay.
- Stop. We're not, okay?

743
01:19:19,048 --> 01:19:22,519
- This is not okay.
- No. Look, we can...

744
01:19:22,619 --> 01:19:26,357
We can watch. We can watch on the video.
We can watch it on the video.

745
01:19:26,457 --> 01:19:28,693
- We have to fix this.
- We can watch it on the video.

746
01:19:30,511 --> 01:19:32,296
- We can watch it.
- I just want to make things okay.

747
01:19:32,396 --> 01:19:33,798
- No, you can't.
- Why not?

748
01:19:33,898 --> 01:19:35,701
It'll be all right.
And please just stay with me.

749
01:19:35,801 --> 01:19:37,975
Just stay with me.
I just want to be with you.

750
01:19:38,075 --> 01:19:40,572
- I want to be with you.
- We can't stay here with you like this.

751
01:19:40,674 --> 01:19:42,755
- I'm leaving.
- No. No.

752
01:19:42,855 --> 01:19:45,035
- I'm getting help.
- You can't. You can't.

753
01:19:45,135 --> 01:19:48,081
No, you can't. No, we know.
You know what we told you.

754
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:53,250
We don't need you.

755
01:19:53,988 --> 01:19:56,622
You don't have any more time.

756
01:20:01,556 --> 01:20:03,663
They're gonna get rid of you.

757
01:20:09,488 --> 01:20:13,176
No, I have to hide you.
I have to hide you.

758
01:20:13,507 --> 01:20:16,312
- I have to hide you where we won't find you.
- We have to go.

759
01:20:18,414 --> 01:20:23,020
- I'm not gonna let anything bad happen.
- Nothing bad is gonna happen.

760
01:21:07,257 --> 01:21:08,237
What are we doing?

761
01:21:10,905 --> 01:21:14,611
- What are we doing out here?
- I'm saving you.

762
01:21:15,673 --> 01:21:17,948
No, I don't need...

763
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:21,018
We need to go back to the cottage.

764
01:21:22,401 --> 01:21:25,823
What are we doing? We need to...

765
01:21:31,832 --> 01:21:33,884
We need to...

766
01:21:35,101 --> 01:21:36,868
Untie me.

767
01:21:37,903 --> 01:21:40,649
- Untie me!
- I'm gonna hide you...

768
01:21:41,236 --> 01:21:43,215
under the water.

769
01:21:45,145 --> 01:21:46,423
They can't reach you there.

770
01:21:48,382 --> 01:21:49,518
They won't find you.

771
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:52,469
- No, no, no, no. No, you can't.
- Yes.

772
01:21:52,569 --> 01:21:56,026
No, I can't hide in the water.
I can't breathe under the water.

773
01:21:56,226 --> 01:21:58,612
No, you don't understand.
You're confused.

774
01:21:58,712 --> 01:22:00,232
- No. No, no, no, no.
- No, you have to.

775
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:03,134
You're confused. I can't...
I can't hide in the water.

776
01:22:03,234 --> 01:22:05,304
- No, I have to hide you.
- Stop it. This isn't hiding!

777
01:22:05,804 --> 01:22:07,688
- You have to hide.
- This isn't hiding!

778
01:22:07,788 --> 01:22:09,441
- This isn't hiding! Stop it!
- Have to!

779
01:22:09,541 --> 01:22:12,210
Fucking stop it! Stop it! No!

780
01:22:41,377 --> 01:22:44,148
<i>For our first date,
Bea chose an Indian restaurant,</i>

781
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,381
<i>you know, one of those
little places on Sixth Street</i>

782
01:22:46,481 --> 01:22:49,506
<i>with the colored lights
and the fiber-optic lamps.</i>

783
01:22:49,606 --> 01:22:52,657
<i>Yum, except that
halfway through the meal,</i>

784
01:22:52,757 --> 01:22:57,865
<i>I start feeling my stomach gurgle in
a horrible food-poisoning-type way,</i>

785
01:22:57,965 --> 01:23:00,774
<i>and I didn't even
have time to lie to her.</i>

786
01:23:00,874 --> 01:23:05,056
<i>I spend 20 minutes in the
dirty restaurant toilet</i>

787
01:23:05,156 --> 01:23:07,699
<i>and the rest of the night
on Bea's bathroom floor,</i>

788
01:23:07,799 --> 01:23:11,992
<i>because I couldn't make it to
the subway, let alone Brooklyn.</i>

789
01:23:14,151 --> 01:23:16,198
<i>So this is our, "Fuck you, Indian food."</i>

790
01:23:16,906 --> 01:23:18,041
<i>You tried to keep us apart,</i>

791
01:23:19,352 --> 01:23:21,163
<i>but fuck you.</i>

792
01:23:21,655 --> 01:23:22,615
<i>We win.</i>

793
01:23:24,192 --> 01:23:26,364
<i>So we didn't get a regular wedding cake.</i>

794
01:23:26,473 --> 01:23:29,997
<i>We decided on something that
was special for us instead.</i>

795
01:23:30,097 --> 01:23:33,427
<i>- Special and cheap.
- What?</i>

796
01:23:35,036 --> 01:23:37,170
<i>No, I think some people
are annoyed by no cake.</i>

797
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:45,083
<i>Who cares? It's our wedding.</i>

798
01:23:58,563 --> 01:24:00,301
<i>I love you, honeybee.</i>

799
01:24:17,985 --> 01:24:21,556
<i>Before, I was alone, but now I'm not.</i>
