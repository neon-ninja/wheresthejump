1
00:00:02,958 --> 00:00:05,541
<i>Shadyside, small-town America.</i>

2
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:10,833
<i>But among locals, a history of horror
has earned it another nickname,</i>

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,291
<i>"Killer Capital USA."</i>

4
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,375
<i>And last night…</i>

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,250
<i>…tragedy struck again.</i>

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,875
<i>I'm here with Sheriff Nick Goode.</i>

7
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,708
<i>Sheriff, what can you tell us?</i>

8
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,375
<i>Um, there were seven victims.</i>

9
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:32,291
<i>None of this… is random.</i>

10
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,875
Oh my God!

11
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,000
<i>These massacres</i>
<i>are connected to Sarah Fier.</i>

12
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,708
1666,
Sarah Fier was hanged for witchcraft.

13
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,208
She's been possessing people,
turning them into killers,

14
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,916
to take revenge on the town.

15
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:50,750
Go! Go!

16
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,125
But in 1978,
there was one survivor, C. Berman.

17
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,333
She's the key.

18
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,458
<i>It's over.</i>

19
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:09,875
<i>Over?</i>

20
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,500
<i>It's never over.</i>

21
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,291
<i>Sam…</i>

22
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,750
Get off!

23
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,166
I'm going to get you back.

24
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,916
<i>Killer Capital, USA.</i>

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,541
<i>After a week of terror,</i>

26
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,916
<i>Shadyside continues to live up
to its twisted nickname.</i>

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,875
<i>Clad in a Halloween skull mask,</i>

28
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,208
<i>Shadyside High graduate Ryan Torres</i>

29
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,416
<i>kicked off the days of terror
with a massacre at the mall.</i>

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,291
<i>And now an already mourning community
is plunged into horror yet again</i>

31
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:15,083
<i>as the Sheriff's Department reports
more carnage at East Union Medical.</i>

32
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:18,291
<i>Police believe the murders
were fueled by amphetamines.</i>

33
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,791
<i>Local teenagers Kate Schmidt
and Simon Kalivoda</i>

34
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,666
<i>are the primary suspects.</i>

35
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,250
<i>The scene of the final carnage
was the local grocery store.</i>

36
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:32,250
<i>Sheriff Nick Goode found the Grab and Bag
soaked in blood and broken dreams.</i>

37
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,250
Major, Jesus!

38
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,583
God damn it!

39
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,166
You're an impatient bastard, aren't you?

40
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,833
<i>Sunnyvale is a city of hope.</i>

41
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,125
<i>My family have lived here for generations,
cultivating the growth of our city.</i>

42
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,583
<i>And now, as I take the torch</i>

43
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,541
<i>carried by my forefathers…</i>

44
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,750
<i>…I'm ready to bring my experience
to City Hall for another two years.</i>

45
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,625
<i>I understand the challenges…</i>

46
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,583
<i>I'm here to listen.</i>

47
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,833
<i>Let's work together
to keep Sunnyvale shining!</i>

48
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,791
It's OK. You stay here.
I'm gonna keep us safe, OK?

49
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,500
- Don't fucking move!
- Wait, wait!

50
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,458
Stop, please! Please! We called you.

51
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,750
Hello, my name is Deena Johnson.
We need to know how you survived!

52
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,541
Hey! We're being attacked, alright?
There are killers here!

53
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,458
- <i>Pick up! We need your help!</i>
<i>- Please!</i>

54
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,958
- Hello?
- You're still alive.

55
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,708
C. Berman…

56
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,916
Why the hell would you come here?

57
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,916
No!

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,125
No, no, no! You need to leave! Right now!
You have no idea what you are doing!

59
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,458
Wait! Yeah, exactly.

60
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,500
You are the only person
who knows what we're dealing with.

61
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:26,458
I don't want that thing near me.
Get that car and "it" off my property.

62
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,833
Her name is Sam.

63
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,750
You could have watched us dead
on the six o'clock news,

64
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,916
but you didn't.

65
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,875
You called us back.

66
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,541
I can't help you with this!

67
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,041
You are our last chance! The witch...

68
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,291
No, I'm sorry.

69
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:44,333
My girlfriend is possessed by her
and tied up in a trunk, but you…

70
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,666
you saw her and you survived.

71
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,333
What was different? Please.

72
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,208
Maybe something happened to you,
something that can help us stop her.

73
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,666
There's not!
You can't stop her.

74
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,208
Run, far as you can, fast as you can!

75
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,875
That is your only chance.

76
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,458
Look, I can't just run!

77
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,333
Look, Sam…

78
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,000
I can't let her die.

79
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,333
I won't!

80
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,333
I love her.

81
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,583
Please!

82
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,625
Just keep her away from Major Tom.

83
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,833
It's completely fine.

84
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,166
She's tied up in the bathroom,
so she, like,

85
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,458
totally can't leave now, we're cool.

86
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,208
Yep, cool.

87
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,750
Cool, cool.

88
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,458
Take a seat.

89
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,750
In Shadyside,

90
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,625
the past is never really past.

91
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:21,291
This was July… 12th.

92
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,166
The summer of 1978.

93
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,333
The first day of camp.

94
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,875
A week later, my sister was dead.

95
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,875
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

96
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,416
You're gonna hang, witch.

97
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,958
Before the witch's final breath,

98
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,791
she found a way to cheat her death.

99
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,875
Oh God!

100
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,918
By cutting off her wicked hand,
she kept her grip upon our land!

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,708
She reaches from beyond the grave,
to make good men her evil slaves.

102
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,666
She'll take your blood, take your head,
she'll follow you until you're dead.

103
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,083
String her up.

104
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,916
No, stop it! Stop it! Stop.

105
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,666
Let me down, you shits! Let me down!

106
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,750
- Well, well. What do we have here?
- Goddamn thief!

107
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,875
No. No, she's no thief.

108
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,708
She's possessed by the witch.

109
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,083
The only way to explain
her psycho behavior.

110
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,833
Fuck you!

111
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,750
Guess we're even now.

112
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,875
You do know what they did
to Sarah Fier, right?

113
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,791
They hanged her,

114
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:10,833
from this very tree.

115
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,583
But she'd have died forever if you did
what you always do to witches…

116
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,541
You burn them.

117
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,500
- Give me your lighter!
- What?

118
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,791
Give it to me!

119
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,416
Now, hold her legs.

120
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,416
Seriously, Sheila?

121
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,416
Do it!

122
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,083
No, no, no! Stop it!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

123
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,000
- Shut up, you witch.
- Sheila! You made your point.

124
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,666
- Don't! Don't!
- Sheila, it was only ten bucks.

125
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,750
Are we really gonna do this?

126
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,583
- Sheila!
- No, no, no!

127
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,875
Sheila!

128
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,791
- Shit! Will, your brother.
- The hell is this? Let her down!

129
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,041
Nick, I can explain.

130
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,000
Let her down, Will!
I swear to God I'll tell Mom!

131
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,375
I went back to my cabin,
the door was open.

132
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,833
All my money was gone
and Ziggy was just sprinting away.

133
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:03,750
- Because you were chasing me.
- Ziggy! You talk when I tell you to talk.

134
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,291
- Did you see her take it?
- Everyone did.

135
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,833
- Everyone.
- Alright.

136
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,583
Well, that's it, Berman.
Five strikes. You're out.

137
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,458
- I'm out? They just tried to murder me!
- Yeah. And I'll deal with them.

138
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:20,625
But first, get back to camp, call Mommy
because you're done at Nightwing.

139
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,250
- I didn't do it.
- Oh, yeah?

140
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,208
Like you didn't set the camp flag on fire?

141
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,916
Or let out the camp rabbits?
Or graffiti the outhouse stalls?

142
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,041
- I warned you...
- Kurt.

143
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,000
It's not her fault, really.

144
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,791
- She's possessed by Sarah Fier.
- Oh, you…

145
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,916
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey.

146
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,125
We kick her out, somebody's gonna ask
about the burn on her arm.

147
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,000
Then who's in trouble? Huh?

148
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,583
Why don't we just let this one slide?
Yeah?

149
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:55,666
Alright. One more strike and you're out
for real. You hear me, Berman?

150
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,833
One more.

151
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,208
Being bossed around by a Goode.

152
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,416
Wow, some things never change.

153
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,458
God, I hate that little bitch.

154
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,041
Hey.

155
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,708
- Have Nurse Lane check that burn out.
- I'm gonna let it get infected and die.

156
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,291
I don't get a thank you?

157
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,375
Oh!

158
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,541
I'm sorry, I forgot!

159
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,041
Thank you, King of Sunnyvale,

160
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,000
future Police Chief Nick Goode,

161
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,625
for rescuing poor, helpless Shadysider me!

162
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,375
How could I ever repay you?

163
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:37,166
Oh, I know. I'll bat my eyes at you,
like all the other dumbass girls.

164
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,500
Boo!

165
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:18,458
Color War begins tonight, guys! Line up
and grab a shirt! Do you have a shirt?

166
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,250
Blue is for beautiful,
if you live in Shadyside.

167
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,875
Red is for radiance,
if you live in Sunnyvale.

168
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,958
Despite our differences,
we're all perfect!

169
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,791
Even you, Ziggy Berman!

170
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,875
What is this gunk?

171
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,708
It just… It won't come off!

172
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,833
That's been there forever, babe.
Just give that up.

173
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,958
- Tommy!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

174
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:56,416
You're right.
It's just, you know, Color War is tonight.

175
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,958
I'm well aware!

176
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,041
We also have to get the Mess Hall ready.

177
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,750
Oh my gosh.

178
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,833
Oh my gosh. This gosh darn moss!

179
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,708
It's… it's all over me!

180
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,375
Oh, hey! It's OK! This isn't a big deal.

181
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,375
What? No, it's not OK!
It… it… it's stained!

182
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,625
Only Cindy Berman would expect
to clean the outhouse and not get dirty.

183
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,666
It's not funny!

184
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,791
It's kinda funny.

185
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,958
Hey!

186
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,333
- What did we talk about?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

187
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,416
You better be.

188
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,458
What is it?

189
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,291
Where are they?

190
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,000
Harder!

191
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,375
Oh my God!

192
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,500
Oh my… Oh my God!

193
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,125
Hey.

194
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,875
- Um… what are you doing?
- Three guesses.

195
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,208
Hey, careful.

196
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,666
You don't wanna corrupt her virgin ears.

197
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,125
We have to get everything together
for Color War. And you guys…

198
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,791
uh, uh… have to finish cleaning
the outhouse.

199
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:29,416
We're doing the shit jobs all summer,
now we have to clean up actual shit? No.

200
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,375
- I'm sorry, but we don't have a choice.
- Shit.

201
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,708
This is our last one, babe.

202
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,416
What are you doing?

203
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,375
Three guesses.

204
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,916
This isn't funny. We have a job to do.

205
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,291
- Alice, put that down.
- Or what?

206
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,208
What, are you gonna snitch on me again?

207
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:59,500
OK. What if you go talk
to your little friend Nurse Lane.

208
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,500
- About getting us some yellow jackets.
- Yes.

209
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,583
- Or some red birds.
- Both.

210
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,708
And then we'll scrub
all the shit you want.

211
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,583
- Yellow jackets, red… What?
- Drugs, baby. Drugs.

212
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,083
- Just hook us up.
- No!

213
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,208
No, I won't do that!

214
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,708
Some people want to do things
with their lives.

215
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:22,416
So stop screwing with mine
and just do your jobs, please!

216
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,625
Maybe you should have thought about that

217
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,958
before blasting Captain and Tennille
for two hours straight.

218
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,250
Snitch.

219
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,625
Bye!

220
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,250
Hey!

221
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,708
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over.

222
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,833
Your sister…

223
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,500
Cindy Berman, that smell better be skunk.

224
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,000
What about my sister?

225
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,333
Nurse Lane! Hello!

226
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,291
I'm in trouble again. Help.

227
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,375
Nurse Lane, come on!
I could die any minute now.

228
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,458
Nurse Lane?

229
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,041
Nurse Lane?

230
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,916
- What are you doing?
- Oh my God!

231
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,958
Nurse Lane, you scared the shit out of me.

232
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:48,916
Are you OK?

233
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,416
I am. Oh my goodness.

234
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,458
Ziggy, Ziggy, Ziggy.

235
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,333
What did we do now?

236
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:04,333
OK, so you are gonna apply this
once a day for three days. OK?

237
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,500
It's gonna protect against infection.

238
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,500
It's gross.

239
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,750
You'll survive.

240
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,208
So, um… what's the Witch's Mark?

241
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,250
You know about my daughter, right?
Ruby Lane?

242
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,458
Uh…

243
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,875
- I don't...
- Of course you do.

244
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,583
Everybody talks, I know.

245
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,916
Tell me, what do they say?

246
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,833
Uh, um… They say she, uh…

247
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,000
she killed people…

248
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
at a party.

249
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,583
- Seven, seven friends.
- Eight.

250
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,000
She killed herself that night too.

251
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,333
So eight.

252
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,250
Ruby was such a sweet girl.

253
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,916
Oh, and she had a sweet voice.
She was in choir.

254
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,666
She wanted to be a singer.

255
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,500
I was so proud of her.

256
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,750
So proud.

257
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,291
The doctors say
it was a psychotic episode,

258
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,250
that she just snapped.

259
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,750
But the kids…

260
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,166
the kids say Sarah Fier made her do it.

261
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,125
That's a little tight.

262
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,541
- What do you think?
- I don't...

263
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,583
'Cause I think you don't go
from being a sweet girl with dreams

264
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,333
to ripping someone's insides out
with a switchblade.

265
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,291
{\an8}- Nurse Lane!
- People usually kill for a reason,

266
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,416
{\an8}and sometimes that reason is justified.

267
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,375
{\an8}Sometimes killing isn't murder.

268
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,875
{\an8}- Sometimes it's necessary.
- That's hurting me.

269
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,750
{\an8}- Sometimes it is good.
- Nurse Lane!

270
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,041
Once a day for three days, OK?

271
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,416
Hi, Nurse Lane.

272
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,541
Hi, Cindy.

273
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,125
Ziggy.

274
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,875
You realize what happens
if you get kicked out, right?

275
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,625
- How awful that would be for me?
- Did someone do something to Nurse Lane?

276
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,541
Like make fun of her daughter?

277
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,208
- Ziggy, are you listening to me?
- She was upset.

278
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,458
I don't care! I…

279
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,000
- Do you hear what I'm saying to you?
- Loud and clear, ma'am.

280
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:17,125
You don't, we had this conversation
last week and the week before that.

281
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,083
- I'm not gonna get kicked out.
- That's not what Kurt thinks.

282
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,791
- Yeah, well, Kurt can suck it.
- No! Ziggy, no!

283
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,750
If you get kicked out, I do too.

284
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,750
Mom can't work and take care of you.
Then how will I pay for college, huh?

285
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,833
Oh, that's funny to you?

286
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,708
Yeah, kinda.

287
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,708
Explain to me what's so funny.

288
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,916
How dumb you are?

289
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,000
No one gets out of this town,
not even Miss Perfect.

290
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,041
Bet on your way out
you get run over by a bus.

291
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:48,083
Once in your life,
could you just not be so… so mean?

292
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,416
Could once in your life
you just stop pretending?

293
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,375
You're Shadyside, in case you forgot.

294
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,333
I swear to God
everyone just wants to ruin my life.

295
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,833
Alice just, like…
She just won't let it go.

296
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,458
It's like we're still 12 years old
and her whole goal in life is to…

297
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,958
to punish me for something
that wasn't even my fault.

298
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,000
I can't believe
you guys used to be friends.

299
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,541
And Ziggy…

300
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,375
It's only a matter of time
before she ends up in jail or worse.

301
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,416
I'm trying to be a good role model
and make something of myself.

302
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,041
But no, no,
I'm the stuck-up priss who hates fun,

303
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,708
which isn't even true at all.
I like fun. I like fun!

304
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,666
I just… I just want
to get out of Shadyside. Is that so crazy?

305
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,000
Shit!

306
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,250
Shit!

307
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,166
Did Cindy Berman just swear?

308
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,708
Not now, Tommy! Not in the mood!

309
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,041
It's OK.

310
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,791
You're OK. You're OK.

311
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,125
Just…

312
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,083
…breathe.

313
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,500
Tommy, is that you?

314
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:13,791
Tommy?

315
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,958
Tommy, what are you doing? You're really…

316
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,041
…freaking me out.

317
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,625
What is it, babe?

318
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,750
- Nurse Lane?
- I'm sorry.

319
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,666
But I can't save you.

320
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,625
I saw your name.

321
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,041
I saw it on the wall.

322
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,541
One way or another,

323
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,500
you're gonna die tonight.

324
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,083
What are you talking about?

325
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:38,791
You got history with her?
She had a grudge against you?

326
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,291
No grudge. No, we barely ever talked.

327
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,166
I… I go to get bug spray from her.
That's it.

328
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,375
It just doesn't…
it doesn't make any sense.

329
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,250
Why… why would she do something like this?

330
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:53,375
- She was nuts, just like her kid.
- Nurse Lane, she never seemed crazy.

331
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:57,208
That's what she said about her kid, but
sane people don't chop up their friends.

332
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,416
Now, tell me again what happened.

333
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,583
Um… uh…
she… she came into the kitchen…

334
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,708
Hey, witch. So sorry.

335
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,500
I know you and Nurse Psycho were close.

336
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,500
- You can visit her in jail now.
- Fuck off, Sheila.

337
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,958
By the way,

338
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,000
you might want to check your stuff.

339
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,958
I think there was an accident
in cabin five.

340
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,333
- Look at her!
- Hurry, witch! Run!

341
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
Hey, Nicky.

342
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,333
Officer Kapinski.

343
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,708
Been meaning to say I'm sorry
about your Pops. He was a good man.

344
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,833
He was a great man. Taken too soon.

345
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,541
Thank you. Yeah. We all miss him.
Big boots to fill.

346
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:44,041
Well, he was at peace, knowing one day
you'd be following in his footsteps.

347
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,125
Sheriff Nick Goode's got
a good ring to it.

348
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,083
You just go easy on me
when you're my boss, huh?

349
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:01,625
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

350
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,041
<i>But I can't save you.</i>

351
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:08,208
<i>One way or another,
you're gonna die tonight.</i>

352
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:12,708
Hey, guys! Dinner time!

353
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,541
Hey! Hey, come on!

354
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,583
- Nurse Lane's daughter killed 7 people.
- Her daughter was Ruby Lane.

355
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:26,500
She was clearly possessed…
just like her crazy daughter.

356
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,125
Sarah Fier strikes again.

357
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,708
- How does the witch choose them?
- It's crazy.

358
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,625
- Is Color War gonna be canceled?
- It starts tonight.

359
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:36,958
Psycho Shadysiders
always fucking ruin everything!

360
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,000
She said one way or another,
I was gonna die tonight.

361
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,166
Spooky!

362
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,958
The kiddos are right.
That's, like, totally witchy behavior.

363
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:50,166
It's just, there must be some explanation.
The witch isn't real.

364
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,291
- Like what?
- Well, maybe…

365
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,583
Maybe she was on something.

366
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:59,916
Drugs are peaceful, not violent.

367
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,791
I'm not talking about marijuana.

368
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:07,750
Just admit you're jealous that the witch
wanted your hubby all to herself!

369
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:11,375
Be serious, man. Why would Nurse Mary
wanna do something like that?

370
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:14,500
- Why would she want me dead?
- Oh, no. She wouldn't.

371
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:16,625
But the witch might!

372
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:20,708
Hey, they're just playing around.

373
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,000
This was nothing, I promise.

374
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,416
Did you see her eyes?

375
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:28,083
There was something in there,
something wrong.

376
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:33,500
Alright!

377
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,166
Chicks, dicks, listen up!

378
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,708
We had a scary situation earlier,
but we cannot let that mess

379
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:43,041
with the most important night
of our summer.

380
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:47,833
Tonight is Sunnyvale versus Shadyside.

381
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:51,583
It is red versus blue.
It is good versus evil.

382
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:56,166
Tonight, we commencicate Color War!

383
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,041
It's "commence." My god.

384
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:03,166
He might be dumb,
but he's kind of shagadelic.

385
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,375
- Oh yeah!
- He's disgusting. You're disgusting.

386
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:10,541
Tonight's first event
is Capture the Flag, baby.

387
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:13,125
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Now, Sunnyvalers…

388
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:16,041
We have never, ever…

389
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,625
…lost a Color War!

390
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,333
Sunnyvale!

391
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:22,208
So let's not let tonight

392
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,625
be a stain on our legacy.

393
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,208
<i>Sunnyvale!</i>

394
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,451
And let's go out there

395
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,958
like our ancestors before us

396
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:36,041
and murder those Shadyside witches!

397
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:38,250
- Yeah!
- Woo!

398
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,333
Uh, hi!

399
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:45,625
Thank you, Kurt, for that neat-o speech.

400
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:48,750
Now, Shadysiders,

401
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:53,250
let's go out there and do our best,

402
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,416
because even if we lose,

403
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,250
we're still winners in our hearts.

404
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,750
Boo!

405
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:02,041
Boo!

406
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:06,583
<i>Sunnyvale! Sunnyvale!</i>

407
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:16,833
What are you doing?

408
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:19,125
Art project.

409
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:21,500
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm not in the mood.

410
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,875
Earlier, you said Mary was upset.

411
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,875
- Oh, so now you care!
- Ziggy, this is serious.

412
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:29,583
It was serious earlier,
and you didn't give a shit.

413
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:35,583
Come on, you were the last person
to see her before she snapped.

414
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,625
What about drugs? Did you see any around?

415
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:40,833
She's a nurse, so yup.

416
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:43,750
- Well, did she mention anything or...
- Nope.

417
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:46,958
Ziggy, I'm just… I'm trying to understand
what happened today.

418
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,000
Who cares? It's over.

419
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:53,583
Not for Tommy. He's still
freaked out and acting weird and…

420
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:57,125
It's just a big joke to everyone.
"Mary was possessed by the witch."

421
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,083
- Maybe it was the witch.
- Ziggy…

422
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:02,875
What? That doesn't fit your carefully
constructed bullshit view of the world?

423
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,750
- Why are you being like this?
- I dunno.

424
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:07,353
Maybe because Nurse Lane was
the only person who was nice to me,

425
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:11,208
and now her life is over because
bad things always happen to Shadysiders.

426
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,541
Nothing just happens.
There's always a reason.

427
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:17,000
Not always a rational one.
Deep down, you feel it, don't you?

428
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:21,708
Shadyside, there's something here.
It's just holding us down, cursing us.

429
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:24,375
- Ziggy, that's enough.
- You're too scared to admit it.

430
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,166
When things go bad,
you wanna explain it away.

431
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:31,041
I'm sorry. I'm not going to blame
everything on some fairy tale.

432
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:35,041
Life sucks sometimes. I get that.
I mean, God knows it's been hard since…

433
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,458
Since what?

434
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,416
See, you can't even say it!

435
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,958
Since Dad left.

436
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,875
Since Mom started drinking.

437
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,791
Since we're going to lose the house.

438
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,875
And it's not gonna magically get better.

439
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:51,541
And saving up all summer to buy
a super cute polo shirt can't hide that.

440
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:57,583
Trying to explain why nice old Nurse Lane
almost lost it today can't either.

441
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,083
We're all cursed.

442
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:01,250
For Mary, it was today.

443
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,416
But someday, it'll be you.

444
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,416
And this whole fake
bullshit life of yours,

445
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
it's gonna come crashing down.

446
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,583
That's a horrible thing to say.

447
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,833
It's not horrible if it's true.

448
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,958
I don't know who you are anymore, but…

449
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,916
But you're not my sister.

450
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:22,875
Then who am I?

451
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,458
A monster.

452
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:30,791
That's what they say.

453
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:04,541
Do… do not let them anywhere near this.
Do you hear me?

454
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:05,666
Yeah!

455
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,333
I said, do you hear me?

456
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:09,833
Yeah!

457
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,458
<i>Shadyside! Shadyside!</i>

458
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,875
Alright, alright, alright!

459
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:21,916
Now remember, keep at least
three defenders by this all the time.

460
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,625
Alright? And who's the jailer?

461
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:27,666
OK, Jeremy, you may be
the most important player in the, uh…

462
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:30,208
in the…

463
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,500
<i>Tommy…</i>

464
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,791
- Tommy!
<i>- Sunnyvale!</i>

465
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:40,875
<i>- Sunnyvale!</i>
- Are you OK?

466
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:42,500
Yeah, are you OK, Mr. Slater?

467
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,500
Yeah, I'm… I'm good. Um…

468
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,750
Why don't you guys get started?
Plant the flag.

469
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:51,500
And I'll be right behind you. OK?
Let's go, Shadyside! Come on!

470
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,863
<i>Shadyside! Shadyside!</i>

471
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:54,125
<i>Move, move, move!</i>

472
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,250
Oh, man.

473
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:59,541
My head is throbbing.
She must have got me pretty good.

474
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:03,291
- Mary's stronger than she looks.
- You need to lie down?

475
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:06,125
No. No, I'm alright. I'm alright.

476
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,666
Good. I need your help,

477
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,958
and the key to the infirmary.

478
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,083
So, what exactly
are we looking for?

479
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Answers.

480
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,083
Come on, Cindy.
It doesn't matter, alright?

481
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,625
It matters.

482
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:48,500
There's a reason Mary did what she did
and said what she said.

483
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:51,666
- We're going to figure it out now.
- Come on, Cindy. Please, I…

484
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,791
No label, half-empty.

485
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:08,500
Like I said, she was on drugs.

486
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:12,416
Get these to the cops,
then they'll tell us what they…

487
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:14,916
What is that?

488
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,708
"A deal was made with the Devil."

489
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:21,041
"Sarah Fier cut off her wicked hand

490
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:24,791
on Satan's stone
in exchange for eternal life,

491
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,500
scarring the soil beneath
with the witch's mark,

492
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,416
bringing Darkness upon the land."

493
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,416
Did you hear that?

494
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:50,666
Hello?

495
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,291
Hello, is somebody in there?

496
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,916
- Argh!
- Jeez!

497
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,333
Come on. That's not funny.

498
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:04,791
Alice? What are you doing here?

499
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:07,625
Looks like we're both here
for the same thing.

500
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,291
Must really want me
to scrub those toilets.

501
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:12,666
This isn't for you.

502
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,833
Whoa, Berman. I didn't know
you were into that kind of thing.

503
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:19,000
They're not for me.
I'm giving them to the cops.

504
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:20,250
Oh yeah, the cops.

505
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,250
Yeah, right, of course.

506
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:26,541
No, what are you talking about?
What, now you're gonna snitch on Mary too?

507
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,750
No. That's… I'm trying to...

508
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:31,125
- This for the cops too?
- Give that back!

509
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:36,375
"She emerged by the Meeting House,

510
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:39,833
one hand severed, lost forever."

511
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:41,791
"We hanged the witch,

512
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:43,500
body chained and buried

513
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:45,041
but without her hand,

514
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:48,791
her grip on the land holds firm."

515
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,166
Ooh!

516
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:52,500
This is Sarah Fier shit!

517
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,708
Alice, come on.

518
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:57,125
"When she is near, blood will fall

519
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:02,250
and the curse will last
until body and hand unite."

520
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:05,291
Alice, it's Mary's diary.
Let's put it back.

521
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:07,000
It's not just a diary.

522
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:10,958
It's a map.

523
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:12,541
What?

524
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,416
Crazy Nurse Lane made a crazy map.

525
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,250
It's camp,
but looks like she drew all over it.

526
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:26,208
1666 Union.

527
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,416
- Union, that's Shadyside.
- What?

528
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,875
The settlement before it was divided
into Shadyside and Sunnyvale.

529
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,041
- Really?
- If you went to class…

530
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:37,208
So, the camp is built in the same place
as the settlement?

531
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,750
Whoa, look, look, look! Sarah Fier!

532
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:43,916
- Do you think that's her house?
- What are all the X's?

533
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,416
There's only one way to find out.

534
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,583
Hey! That's my bag!

535
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:50,666
Arnie, flashlight.

536
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,375
- What is this shit?
- Let me see.

537
00:34:57,958 --> 00:34:59,041
L484.

538
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:03,166
- Sounds familiar. Ooh, Dex, maybe.
- Know what sounds fun?

539
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:06,708
- Seeing a witch's house high on Dex.
- Oh yes, it does.

540
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:10,458
Alice! Bring that back!
What are you doing?

541
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:14,083
It's called fun, Cindy Berman.
You used to have it, remember?

542
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:16,791
- We're gonna find you, Sarah Fier!
- Tommy!

543
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:20,208
<i>Tommy…</i>

544
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,458
Tommy!

545
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,541
Come on, they took everything!

546
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,916
Go away, Cindy!

547
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,875
It's me. It's Nick.

548
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,875
Go away, Nick!

549
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,541
Whoa.

550
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,833
- I like what you've done with the place.
- This wasn't me.

551
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:48,916
I'm shocked.

552
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,583
"Ziggy is a witch bitch."

553
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:54,875
"Ziggy sucks cocks in Hell." Jeez.

554
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,166
Sheila?

555
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:58,708
Colonel Mustard.

556
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:04,250
- Oh, looks like blood.
- Yeah. I didn't have a pig, so…

557
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,458
<i>Carrie.</i> Cool.

558
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,375
You've read <i>Carrie?</i>

559
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,916
Yeah. Second favorite after <i>Salem's Lot.</i>

560
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,833
Still, I dunno,
paint seems a little pedestrian.

561
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,916
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have a better idea?

562
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,416
Maybe.

563
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,875
Shouldn't you be, like,
turning me in or something?

564
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:26,541
Well, I should be supervising
Color War, uh…

565
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,333
- But noticed you were MIA and...
- So you decided to stalk me.

566
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,166
Check in on you.

567
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,208
Clearly you don't need my assistance.
All good. Go ahead.

568
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,375
"Carrie" on.

569
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,875
What's your idea?

570
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,583
Science & Nature.

571
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,625
Alice!

572
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:53,541
Alice!

573
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:57,000
Come on, it's disgusting in here!

574
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,791
We're close,
Berman, hang in there!

575
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:03,125
This was the best idea.

576
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:06,166
Yeah, but I still don't feel shit.

577
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,708
OK, so, take more.

578
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,416
Thank you.

579
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,083
L484.

580
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,458
- Arnie!
- Wait up!

581
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,541
Alice!

582
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,916
I swear to God…

583
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:22,541
Shit!

584
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,000
- Oh, it's ruined now!
- You cursed again.

585
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:27,833
You want me to murder you?

586
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:29,958
- Babe, you OK?
- Yeah.

587
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,875
Yeah, I'm fine.

588
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:35,000
Alice?

589
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:48,666
Watch your step.

590
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,833
Is someone digging a grave?

591
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,375
Graves.

592
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,375
Mary.

593
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:03,875
Hey, where's the, uh…

594
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,500
The X's, look. Look.

595
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,583
Look, here. Here.

596
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,166
She was marking where she dug.

597
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,791
"But without her hand,

598
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:22,166
her grip on the land holds firm

599
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:26,041
and the curse will last
until body and hand unite."

600
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,708
Maybe Mary was looking for the hand.

601
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,958
- To end the curse?
- That made her daughter lose her mind.

602
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,083
Guys, come on.

603
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,125
- This is silly.
- Yeah.

604
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,083
I gotta piss.

605
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,791
Hey, let me see that.

606
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,250
You can have it,

607
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,916
but first give me the drugs.

608
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,541
L484,

609
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:50,666
L484,

610
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,291
L4…

611
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,458
…84.

612
00:38:56,833 --> 00:39:00,750
If Nurse Mary took them and went crazy,
those drugs are very dangerous.

613
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,708
Oh my God!

614
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,291
What happened to you?

615
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,291
You remember when we used to have fun?

616
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,916
- Before you became a snitch?
- Just let it go already.

617
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,375
That's easy for you to say.

618
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:15,791
- You lying fucking Brutus.
- I found it!

619
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,000
I found the witch's house.

620
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,333
Dude…

621
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:30,083
Was I the only one expecting, like,
I dunno, a house made out of candy?

622
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,686
Maybe there's candy down here.

623
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,041
Whoa!

624
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,083
Hey, Sarah,
you got any candy down there?

625
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,333
We're high and hungry.

626
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,041
- Sarah Fier!
- OK, we've seen enough.

627
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,958
Alright then, go home, Berman.

628
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,166
I didn't march all the way out here
for nothing, OK?

629
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,166
Are you crazy? Alice!

630
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,458
Alice!

631
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,208
Hey, someone's been down here.

632
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,333
Like, recently.

633
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,166
Look at all this witchy shit.

634
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,208
It's Sarah Fier!

635
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,750
Sarah Fier isn't real.

636
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,708
Well, someone lit that candle.

637
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:48,000
Hey, Sarah Fier, if you're in here,
say something!

638
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,583
Maybe she's shy.

639
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,166
Ali… Alice! God!

640
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,041
Whoa!

641
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:11,750
It's some kind of, like, occult thing…

642
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,833
Like Devil worship.

643
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,958
- It's kinky.
- Oh, yeah.

644
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,333
It's the witch's mark.

645
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,250
The what?

646
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:29,375
"A deal was made with the Devil."

647
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:32,708
"Sarah Fier cut off her wicked hand
on Satan's stone

648
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,708
in exchange for eternal life,

649
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:38,500
scarring the soil beneath
with the witch's mark,

650
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,083
bringing Darkness upon the land."

651
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,250
That's it.

652
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,125
It's acetaminophen.

653
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:46,875
- Arnie, what are you talking about?
- L484.

654
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:51,125
It just hit me. It's fucking Tylenol.
It's nothing.

655
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,375
Are you sure?

656
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:53,458
Positive.

657
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
Come on, Alice.
Let's get out of here.

658
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:01,833
Pretty sure Joan might still have
some weed if we pay her.

659
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,333
We are out of here.

660
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,250
Let's go, man.

661
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:22,416
Hey, you alright, man?

662
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Hello?

663
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,375
Hello?

664
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,000
<i>Cindy.</i>

665
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:49,875
<i>Cindy!</i>

666
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:54,500
- I need to show you something.
- This place…

667
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:56,916
- It keeps on going.
- Now!

668
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,500
Cyrus Miller.

669
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,625
Billy Barker. Ruby Lane.

670
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,750
- Mary's daughter.
- Yeah.

671
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,708
Isaac Milton, Harry Rooker.

672
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:12,250
You don't have to go to fucking class
to know those names.

673
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,333
- The Shadyside Killers.
- Yeah.

674
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:16,958
Except one.

675
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:25,500
Tommy? Alice, this isn't funny.

676
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:29,916
What, you think I carved your boyfriend's
name into solid stone with my fingernails?

677
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:31,916
Someone else did this.

678
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:38,541
<i>Tommy.</i>

679
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,583
Hello?

680
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,333
Whatever you're on, man,
thanks for sharing.

681
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:49,916
Dick.

682
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,250
Tommy?

683
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,500
What the hell are you doing, man? Tommy…

684
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:08,208
Oh my God! No, no, Tommy! Stop!

685
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:09,625
Tommy, stop!

686
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:16,583
- Come on! Come on!
- Fuck!

687
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:21,291
Here.

688
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:22,916
Help me.

689
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,333
Go, go, go!

690
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,708
No! No!

691
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,166
Do you hear that?

692
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,041
He's still alive?

693
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:16,750
He can't… He can't get us.

694
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:22,125
He can't get us.

695
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:53,333
Get in jail, Shadyside trash!

696
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,708
You're property of Sunnyvale now!

697
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:59,666
You move, you speak, you fucking die!

698
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,750
Go!

699
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:02,416
Sheila.

700
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:03,958
From Will.

701
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:38,833
Will! This is too cute.

702
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:42,041
Could have done it in your bunk,
but I guess this is kind of hot.

703
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:07,000
Please somebody help me!

704
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,916
Help me! Somebody help me! Please!

705
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:20,083
- Did you hear her?
- She sounded like a frog.

706
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:23,416
- What'd I tell ya?
- Fuck paint.

707
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,583
Fuck paint.

708
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:27,916
Who are you?

709
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:29,625
Nick Goode.

710
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:33,750
Nice to meet you.

711
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:36,875
It's some kind of cavern.

712
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:39,625
I don't know. It seems to just…

713
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:41,958
go on forever.

714
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:43,166
I don't care.

715
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:49,458
Alice, can you please just…

716
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:51,916
help me?

717
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,083
What, you're just gonna pretend
that everything's OK?

718
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,500
Alice, I just…

719
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:04,541
Tommy split Arnie's head in half.

720
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,208
Do you realize that?

721
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:10,875
- Please, can you just help me?
- With what?

722
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:14,916
This shit weighs, like, a million pounds.
I thought you got an A in physics.

723
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,375
We have to get out!

724
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,625
Well, tough shit.

725
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:19,541
Because we can't.

726
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:22,041
We're gonna die down here.

727
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:24,125
Just like Arnie.

728
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,666
No, no. We have to get out!

729
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:31,875
We have to!

730
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:35,416
Those names on the wall,
they didn't stop with one murder.

731
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,833
Seven, nine, ten, fifteen people.

732
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,458
Those were serial killers.

733
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:41,750
The campers…

734
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:45,583
My… my sister, they're up there.

735
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,541
And now, so is he.

736
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:51,458
I thought you didn't believe in the witch.

737
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:52,916
Yeah, I don't! I…

738
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,208
The… There must be some… some explanation.

739
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:58,958
Oh my God,
you are fucking unbelievable, Cindy. OK?

740
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:00,416
He was possessed!

741
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,125
- Maybe… Maybe he took a pill or...
- No!

742
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:06,208
No! Cindy, no!
It wasn't the fucking Tylenol, alright?

743
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:07,916
It was the witch.

744
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,083
Alright, you saw those names.

745
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:11,666
And that… that ritual,

746
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:14,208
the witch is real.

747
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:18,000
And she's doing some…
some fucking spell shit

748
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,791
and possessing people.

749
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:21,833
OK? Every name on that rock.

750
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:24,541
And Mary knew it, alright?

751
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:26,916
She knew it. And it's all right here.

752
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,583
This isn't real!

753
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,000
You want an explanation?

754
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:34,333
Well, here it is. OK?

755
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,916
She looked for the hand bone
to fucking stop the curse,

756
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,958
to save Shadyside,
but she couldn't find it.

757
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:40,625
Wanna know what she did find?

758
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,916
Your boyfriend's name
in that fucking wall.

759
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,833
No.

760
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:47,458
- So she tried to kill him.
- Stop.

761
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:49,166
Which I also would've done,

762
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:52,250
if I knew there was a chance
that Tommy fucking Slater

763
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:55,833
would ax my boyfriend in the fucking head!

764
00:49:55,916 --> 00:49:57,708
Listen! Shut up!

765
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:00,208
There we go.

766
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,125
That's the Cindy Berman I knew.

767
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:06,833
Hey, where are you going?

768
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:08,375
To find another way out.

769
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:10,166
Don't follow me.

770
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,291
Don't come back here, alright?

771
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:15,791
Alright, do you hear me?
Don't come back!

772
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:21,791
<i>Cindy…</i>

773
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:30,750
You're fine, you're fine.

774
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:35,541
Boo!

775
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:40,916
Jesus, what the hell?
I told you not to follow me.

776
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,333
Yeah, I didn't.

777
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:44,416
You went in a circle.

778
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:47,166
Fucking circle.

779
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:04,916
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

780
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,750
One, two, three, four.

781
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:08,666
- What are you doing?
- Four.

782
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,750
This symbol, it branches off here.
Four times.

783
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:14,375
Three there, one there.

784
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:15,916
Just like this cave.

785
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,208
It's the same.

786
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,541
"Sarah Fier cut off her wicked hand
on Satan's stone,

787
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:23,416
scarring the soil beneath
with the witch's mark."

788
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,791
"Scarring the soil."

789
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,208
So, what, like, the witch
made this fucking place?

790
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:31,791
Or the settlers claimed she did.
It doesn't matter.

791
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:34,666
- All that matters is this symbol. It's a...
- It's a map.

792
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:49,833
Can I, uh… get you a water
or a juice box maybe?

793
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:50,916
We're fine.

794
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:56,958
Cool. Yeah, I just thought, you know,
since we're all in here and in jail

795
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:59,750
that you might want
some refreshments, but, uh…

796
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:03,250
Or we can, uh… We can… We can…
Well, we can play a game.

797
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,041
Do you guys like, uh, Charades...

798
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,500
Shut the fuck up, nerd.

799
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,041
Yeah, OK. Sure. Um…

800
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,333
Sunnyvalers,

801
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,500
these inmates are property of Shadyside.

802
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:40,458
If you… If you don't leave,
I… I'll be forced to get you.

803
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,291
Hey, nerd!

804
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,291
No. Hey, hey, hey!
That's not fair!

805
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:52,875
Come on! Go, go!

806
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:54,791
- Run, run!
- No, no, no, no.

807
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:56,000
Go, go, go!

808
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:57,625
Man…

809
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:10,375
Tommy?

810
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:21,583
Alright, next question.

811
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:24,250
Uh…

812
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:27,291
What about you and your sister?
You guys ever get along?

813
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,958
Thought these were supposed to be
easy questions.

814
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:30,916
Says who?

815
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,291
There are no rules to this game.

816
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:35,458
God, I hate snakes.

817
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:37,208
Why are you dodging my question?

818
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:38,958
Why do you care?

819
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:40,083
I'm curious.

820
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:44,666
- I've hated her since I was a baby. Next.
- Come on.

821
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,875
Why are you so full of shit?

822
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,000
What?

823
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:50,208
Nick Goode,

824
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,000
heir apparent,

825
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:55,125
Daddy was the police chief,
the King of Sunnyvale,

826
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:56,375
you're gonna be the same.

827
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:58,083
Except it's all make-believe.

828
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:04,166
The truth is you like Stephen King
and spiders and…

829
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:07,291
the weird girl from Shadyside.

830
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:08,958
Alright, first of all,

831
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:12,666
Stephen King is, like, super popular.

832
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,333
And, second,

833
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:17,375
I can't like the weird girl.

834
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:18,750
Why not?

835
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:21,000
Because I'm a counselor.

836
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:22,333
She's a camper.

837
00:54:22,416 --> 00:54:24,458
Last year for me. First year for you.

838
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:29,833
Plus, how will I ever get to know her
when she keeps dodging my questions?

839
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:44,000
There was a time
when things were good between us.

840
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:47,333
When my dad was around
and my mom was happy,

841
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:49,208
and my sister and me, we would, um…

842
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:52,625
we'd throw toilet paper
on Mr. Corkle's tree,

843
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:55,375
and then go jump in the lake
in all our clothes and…

844
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:58,458
And now…

845
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:02,791
Now it's just gone and everything's shit.

846
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:07,541
That's what happens
when you live in Shadyside.

847
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:10,083
Everything turns to shit eventually.

848
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,333
But I wouldn't expect
a Sunnyvaler to understand.

849
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:19,458
No, maybe you're right.

850
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:23,833
But, uh… being the heir apparent
isn't always easy either.

851
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:25,791
Before he died,

852
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:29,416
my dad loaded me up with all this,

853
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,458
you know, "You're my legacy,

854
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:34,083
the future of the family
depends on you" shit.

855
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:39,916
You know, he just dropped
this huge burden in my lap and…

856
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,875
I dunno, what if I don't want that?

857
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,958
What if that's not who I want to be?

858
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:49,541
What if I want to be the kid
who likes spiders and Stephen King and...

859
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:51,625
And the weird girl from Shadyside?

860
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:55,375
Yeah.

861
00:55:57,708 --> 00:55:59,291
The weird girl from Shadyside.

862
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:01,958
But, uh…

863
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:05,041
I guess there's nothing I can do about it.

864
00:56:05,541 --> 00:56:06,541
Why not?

865
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:13,375
Yeah, you were right. Can we, uh…
Can we go back to the easy questions?

866
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:15,791
OK.

867
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:19,583
Um…

868
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:21,583
How about…

869
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:45,416
He's dead!

870
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,208
- Jeremy's dead!
- No, you guys! OK? Hey!

871
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:51,541
We're done. Everyone get back.
Hey, no! Color War's done! Alright?

872
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:54,083
Get out of here! Get out!

873
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:56,125
Let's go! Get out! Let's go!

874
00:56:56,833 --> 00:57:00,625
Alright, it branches off again here.
Just stay left.

875
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:05,041
I cannot believe this is working.

876
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:08,708
It's taking too long.
He could be back at camp already.

877
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:12,416
If you have to kill him…

878
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:13,916
could you?

879
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:17,916
Earlier, when Mary attacked, I just…

880
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:22,125
I froze. I couldn't do anything.

881
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:29,958
So, no, I… I couldn't kill anyone,
much less Tommy.

882
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:33,875
Well, good news. I would happily kill him.

883
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,708
God, even now, after everything,
you're… you're still a jerk.

884
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:42,541
OK, I'm sorry. I just…
I never got what you saw in him.

885
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,791
And that was before
the witch possessed him.

886
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:47,708
Tommy…

887
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:50,083
Tommy was sweet.

888
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:52,583
He made me feel like

889
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:55,916
everything was going to be OK.

890
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:58,208
I loved him.

891
00:57:58,291 --> 00:57:59,708
I really did.

892
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:01,208
I loved Arnie too.

893
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:05,083
I loved that gross, high little shit.

894
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:09,666
Do you hear that?

895
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
There's this space here up ahead.

896
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:16,083
All roads lead here.

897
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:20,583
Is there any other way around?

898
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:32,916
What the hell?

899
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,750
Flies? What is this stuff?

900
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:36,000
It's everywhere.

901
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:39,958
Cindy?

902
00:58:41,916 --> 00:58:43,083
What is that?

903
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:51,291
Let's get out of here.

904
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:58,166
<i>Alice…</i>

905
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,291
<i>Alice…</i>

906
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:12,458
Alice!

907
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:17,208
Alice?

908
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:45,666
Let's go! This is not part of the game!
Go, guys! Go, go!

909
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,916
Five, seven, eight, ten,

910
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,875
fifteen, eighteen…

911
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:56,541
- Stay calm! Everything's alright!
- How many?

912
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:58,916
- Twenty-three.
- That's 30 missing at least.

913
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,833
- Where's Cindy, Kurt, Joan?
- I don't know. I haven't seen them.

914
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:03,375
Or Tommy or anyone.

915
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:06,018
- The lights are coming on!
- Maybe they're looking for us.

916
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:08,500
- It's dead.
- We have to go. We have to warn people.

917
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:11,875
- I'm sure they heard the bell. Hey!
- My sister, she's still out there!

918
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:14,250
The same sister you've hated
since you were a baby?

919
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:16,375
Look, I'm sorry.

920
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:19,125
I didn't mean it. Me and Gary will go.

921
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:21,166
- What?
- Just please stay here.

922
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,458
- I can't sit here!
- I'm not letting you get hurt!

923
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:26,583
- What the hell?
- OK?

924
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:30,125
Please, let me do my job.

925
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:33,250
I'm gonna find your sister.
Just stay here. OK?

926
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,291
- You.
- Hey, you realize that's a camper, right?

927
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:41,166
Look, you make for cabin one.
I'll head to nine.

928
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:44,458
- What if the killer's still out there?
- That's the whole point, Gary.

929
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:49,625
Hey, everybody! Stay here! OK? OK.

930
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:53,541
Hey!

931
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,416
- Where is she, witch?
- You kill her like you killed Jeremy?

932
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,083
- What are you talking about?
- Sheila!

933
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:00,250
Where the fuck is Sheila?

934
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:03,041
Shit!

935
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:07,458
Nick! Nick, we forgot Sheila!

936
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:10,958
Shit!

937
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:17,833
Cindy!

938
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:19,333
Kurt!

939
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:22,333
Alice!

940
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,250
Joan!

941
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:27,000
Fuck.

942
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,250
Where the fuck is everyone?

943
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:36,416
Stay put, big boy.

944
01:01:38,541 --> 01:01:40,791
Oh, yeah. Oh!

945
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:52,625
You tell anyone about this,
and you're dead.

946
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,541
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

947
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:02,083
Just admit that Shadysiders do it better.

948
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,375
I ain't admitting shit.

949
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:06,166
He knows.

950
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:21,958
Yes.

951
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:34,125
Joan, I can smell that shit
from here! Put it out!

952
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:37,041
You know, you Sunnyvalers
are really missing out.

953
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:40,041
This shit, like, really…

954
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:43,250
opens up your mind.

955
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:44,416
Put it out!

956
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:21,416
Okie dokie!

957
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,500
Tommy!

958
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:37,541
Alice!

959
01:03:37,625 --> 01:03:38,625
Jesus!

960
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,458
I was there, in the past.

961
01:03:41,541 --> 01:03:43,958
- You're OK.
- I saw the… the killers.

962
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:46,250
They killed so many and you're next.

963
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:47,875
You're fucking next!

964
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:50,916
No, no, no, no.
That's not true. I'm right here.

965
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,333
The witch did this.

966
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:56,458
She did all of this. She put a curse
on Shadyside. Mary was right.

967
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,541
I know.

968
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,208
The cave was alive, Alice.

969
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,125
Tylenol can't do that.

970
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:10,000
You were right.

971
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:12,791
I am a snitch.

972
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,625
The day after we stole
Mr. Evans's JVC player,

973
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,375
Harold Hines saw me with it.

974
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:21,000
Fucking Harold Hines.

975
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:27,500
Next thing I know,
I'm in the Principal's office,

976
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:29,333
and my dad can't come in

977
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:33,208
because he just ran off with some girl
not much older than I am now.

978
01:04:33,291 --> 01:04:38,250
And my mom, well, she was having
a few drinks at O'Connell's.

979
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,708
And I knew then…

980
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:43,250
I wasn't different
from the other Shadysiders.

981
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:45,750
I was cursed.

982
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:49,375
I told myself if I was perfect,

983
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:51,291
if I did everything right,

984
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:52,916
I could beat it.

985
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:55,041
I snitched on you,

986
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:57,250
I got new friends, I…

987
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:00,500
started dressing like this.

988
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:07,333
I dated sweet Tommy.

989
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:10,708
I avoided you,

990
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:12,916
but I couldn't avoid Ziggy.

991
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:19,125
Because she was always there,
reminding me of the truth.

992
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:21,291
That this town, this place…

993
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:24,166
…was cursed.

994
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:27,583
And so were we.

995
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:29,875
Now I know.

996
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:31,833
She was right…

997
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,916
all this time.

998
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,125
I've been a bad sister.

999
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:44,250
I've been a bad friend.

1000
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:47,833
I should've just…

1001
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:51,750
skipped class, partied, had sex, had fun.

1002
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:53,541
I hate to break it to you,

1003
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:55,500
but the fun…

1004
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:00,958
it's not any more real
than your polo shirt.

1005
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,833
There's a reason I wear these.

1006
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:06,916
And it's not just because they're awesome.

1007
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:17,666
We all have our ways
to deal with Shadyside.

1008
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:25,458
What? What is it?

1009
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:28,541
This.

1010
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:31,791
This moss, it stained my shirt.
The outhouse!

1011
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:39,250
This stuff is all over the outhouse.

1012
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:42,708
Camp.

1013
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:46,250
It means we're close.

1014
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:50,208
Everyone, listen up! The game is over!

1015
01:06:50,791 --> 01:06:53,791
Get back to the Mess Hall
or I'll dock you a victory point!

1016
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:59,250
Claire! Freddy! Jesus!

1017
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:02,500
Get to the Mess Hall! Come on! Go!

1018
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,750
Everyone, the game is over!

1019
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:13,291
Get back to the Mess Hall!

1020
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:15,083
Was that Counselor Goode?

1021
01:07:15,166 --> 01:07:16,791
Hey! I said no talking!

1022
01:07:17,541 --> 01:07:20,000
- He said the game was over!
- No talking, dweeb!

1023
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:23,500
Just stay put.
I'll check with Counselor Goode.

1024
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:26,375
Hey, we need… that.

1025
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:27,458
Hold on.

1026
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,375
Maybe we should just leave.

1027
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Shit!

1028
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,416
Counselor Tommy?

1029
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:13,666
Oh shit!

1030
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:22,958
Sheila?

1031
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:25,500
Sheila, are you still in here?

1032
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:27,333
Sheila?

1033
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:32,125
You bitch!

1034
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:34,375
Sheila! Listen to me!

1035
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:39,250
Do you smell that?

1036
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:41,083
Ugh.

1037
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,166
It smells like shit.

1038
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:50,125
- Is that toilet paper?
- It's the outhouse. It's gotta be.

1039
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:56,583
- Holy shit.
- There it is. Look.

1040
01:08:58,458 --> 01:08:59,458
Bitch!

1041
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:07,083
I'm trying to help you! There's a killer...

1042
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:09,833
Oh shit!

1043
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:12,041
I heard shouting. What's going...?

1044
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,916
- What's going on in here?
- Is everyone OK?

1045
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,958
No! Everyone's headed back
to the Mess Hall.

1046
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:18,041
Where's Nick?

1047
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:21,666
Help! Help! We're down here! Help!

1048
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,166
Do you hear that?

1049
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,375
Hello?

1050
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:30,333
- Down here!
- Please help us!

1051
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:33,416
- Please, help us!
- Get us out of here!

1052
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,000
- Hey! Hello!
- Help us!

1053
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:37,708
Will you please help us?

1054
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:38,791
Cindy?

1055
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:41,000
Ziggy? Oh my God!

1056
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:43,291
- What are you doing down there?
- It's…

1057
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:47,250
It's kind of a long story.
Are you OK?

1058
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,500
Yeah, hold on a second.

1059
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,750
Ziggy, are you OK?

1060
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:52,458
Are you OK?

1061
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:55,208
What is going on?

1062
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,625
- My sister's in the toilet.
- What?

1063
01:09:57,708 --> 01:09:58,875
Gary! Just help me!

1064
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:02,833
Come on! Go! Back to the Mess Hall,
you hear me? Let's go!

1065
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,416
If anyone's in there, the game's over!

1066
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:25,333
Oh God.

1067
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,083
Oh shit!

1068
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:47,250
Nick! I came out of the bathroom,
she was just dead, man! I swear to God!

1069
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:50,500
Jesus, man.

1070
01:10:51,666 --> 01:10:53,083
Did you do this?

1071
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,958
- Listen, there's a fucking killer.
- What?

1072
01:10:57,041 --> 01:10:59,958
We have to get the others out of here.
Get back to the Mess Hall.

1073
01:11:00,041 --> 01:11:02,166
In 15 minutes, ring the bell.

1074
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,916
Ring the bell, that's the signal.

1075
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,625
Get them on the bus,
get them out of here. Alright?

1076
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:07,875
You hear me?

1077
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:09,625
Just go! Go, Kurt!

1078
01:11:19,958 --> 01:11:22,875
- Get on! We're pulling you up!
- Yes!

1079
01:11:23,666 --> 01:11:26,250
- Dude, oh my God.
- Pull it. You first.

1080
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:34,458
Now!

1081
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:57,333
Keep pulling!

1082
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:01,875
Tommy! Tommy, what are you doi…

1083
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:21,500
Ziggy!

1084
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:24,583
- Ziggy!
- Get him off!

1085
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:27,041
- Ziggy! Ziggy!
- Get him off me!

1086
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,833
- Get him off! Get him off!
- Ziggy!

1087
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:34,916
What are you doing?

1088
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,708
- He's here!
- Come on!

1089
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:49,416
- Did we lose him?
- Yeah, I think so. Are you OK? You hurt?

1090
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,916
It's not my blood. It's Gary's.

1091
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:58,416
- And yours?
- Um… Sean, Jesse, Rod, Stacey.

1092
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,291
Shadysiders. It's the curse.

1093
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:03,291
No, it's, uh, it's just some psycho.

1094
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:06,208
No, no, it's not some psycho. It's Tommy.

1095
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:09,916
My sister's perfect, virgin,
boring boyfriend Tommy.

1096
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
She did this.

1097
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,625
- Cindy?
- The witch!

1098
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:16,000
That's not real, Ziggy.

1099
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:18,791
Exactly what Sunnyvaler would say.
I thought you were different.

1100
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:21,875
They're getting on the bus. We have to go!

1101
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:26,083
- I can't! My sister is still out there!
- Ziggy, I've let a lot of people die.

1102
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:29,083
- Nick, this isn't your fault.
- Not you! I'm not letting you die.

1103
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:31,708
Because, uh… yeah!

1104
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:34,041
I do like the weirdo from Shadyside.

1105
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:35,791
Maybe once we get out of this,

1106
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:38,541
we could, uh…
we could start a book club or something.

1107
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:42,541
Maybe… I dunno, Stephen King's new one
is supposed to be good, I hear.

1108
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:45,791
I'm done with King.
Judy Blume for me from now on.

1109
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:49,041
Yeah, Judy Blume sounds, uh…
sounds perfect.

1110
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,291
You believe me, right? About the curse?

1111
01:13:53,083 --> 01:13:55,375
Yeah, of course. I am different.

1112
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,875
Now, come on. We gotta get out of here.

1113
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:01,541
We'll call the cops.
Your sister's gonna be alright.

1114
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,416
First, we gotta get on that bus.

1115
01:15:34,166 --> 01:15:35,958
Ziggy!

1116
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:44,458
Run.

1117
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:45,583
Aaah! Run!

1118
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:48,666
Run!

1119
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:57,250
Ziggy!

1120
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,291
Ziggy!

1121
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,833
We have to find another way out.

1122
01:16:05,333 --> 01:16:06,708
What if there's not?

1123
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:08,500
No, no, there's gotta be.

1124
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:11,250
We're at the outhouse. We're at camp.

1125
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,208
Come on, get the diary. We're too close.

1126
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:19,958
OK, these… these tunnels.

1127
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:23,125
The witch, she made them, right?

1128
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:24,208
Yeah?

1129
01:16:25,041 --> 01:16:29,291
And, "She emerged by the Meeting House,

1130
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,625
one hand severed lost forever."

1131
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:34,500
The Meeting House, which is now…

1132
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:37,666
The Mess Hall.

1133
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,833
There's gotta be another way out.

1134
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:42,416
Oh God!

1135
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,791
Come on!

1136
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:45,916
- I'm just gonna slow you down.
- Alice!

1137
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,208
No, it's fine. I'll catch up.
You gotta save your sister.

1138
01:16:49,291 --> 01:16:50,125
No…

1139
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:51,208
Go!

1140
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:02,833
Kurt! Will! Anybody!

1141
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:41,125
"Blood will fall…"

1142
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:50,708
"When she is near, blood will fall."

1143
01:17:51,916 --> 01:17:55,333
"Her hand laid to rest
atop Satan's stone."

1144
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,916
Satan's stone…

1145
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,500
Hello?

1146
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:49,166
Can anyone hear me? Hello?

1147
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:53,416
Hello?

1148
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,708
Can anyone hear me? Hello!

1149
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:23,541
Hey! Hey, I'm over here! Help!

1150
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,000
Help!

1151
01:20:52,416 --> 01:20:53,416
Ziggy!

1152
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:54,916
Ziggy!

1153
01:20:58,791 --> 01:20:59,791
No!

1154
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:48,125
No!

1155
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:01,250
Fuck… you!

1156
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:08,833
You swore!

1157
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,291
It's becoming a habit.

1158
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:20,875
You smell like shit.

1159
01:22:20,958 --> 01:22:23,541
- Yeah, that's because I'm covered in it.
- Oh God.

1160
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:28,500
- Do you think it'll wash out?
- You might need to buy a new polo.

1161
01:22:31,416 --> 01:22:32,875
I'm so sorry, Ziggy.

1162
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:38,750
I'm… I'm sorry I wasn't here,
not just tonight, but every day.

1163
01:22:38,833 --> 01:22:40,625
No, you were. You just...

1164
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:42,541
No, no. I haven't been here.

1165
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:44,708
I know that now.

1166
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:49,083
I know that you just needed me
to listen, to hear you.

1167
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:53,958
I thought if I just put my head down
and followed the rules,

1168
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:55,958
everything would be fine,

1169
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:58,583
that I'd get out of Shadyside, but…

1170
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:01,625
but now I know you were right.

1171
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:05,041
Everything is cursed.

1172
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:08,500
I could have been nicer.

1173
01:23:09,458 --> 01:23:12,208
I could have been less of a… of a monster.

1174
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:13,708
Yeah. Well…

1175
01:23:16,208 --> 01:23:17,416
You were my monster.

1176
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,541
And at the end of the day, Mom, Dad…

1177
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:24,458
Shadyside, Sunnyvale, I…

1178
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:29,458
I won't let anything pull us apart again.

1179
01:23:29,541 --> 01:23:30,541
You hear me?

1180
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:33,958
Loud and clear, ma'am.

1181
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:01,166
Hey, snitch!

1182
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:03,416
What took you so long?

1183
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:08,291
Come on!

1184
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:19,708
You did it.

1185
01:24:21,166 --> 01:24:22,166
We did it.

1186
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:28,208
OK, careful, OK?
This thing's like a million years old.

1187
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:30,166
I bought that a month ago.

1188
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:32,833
No, I'm not talking
about your stupid bag, genius.

1189
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:34,708
"Blood will fall."

1190
01:24:35,708 --> 01:24:38,083
Satan's stone, OK? It was right there.

1191
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:41,750
All this time, buried under the moss,
and I found it.

1192
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,875
I fucking found it.

1193
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:45,333
Found what?

1194
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:47,541
Three guesses.

1195
01:24:55,916 --> 01:24:57,916
What? What is it?

1196
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:03,333
It's Sarah Fier's lost hand.

1197
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:07,083
Nurse Lane…

1198
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,500
she spent her entire life
looking for this.

1199
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:14,458
A way to stop the curse
that took her daughter.

1200
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,583
"Without her hand,
her grip on the land holds firm."

1201
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:22,291
"The curse will last

1202
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:25,250
until body and hand unite."

1203
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:27,250
This led us to the hand bone.

1204
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,958
And if the legend is true,
that means her body's still buried...

1205
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:32,791
By the Hanging Tree.

1206
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:34,166
We can end this.

1207
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,875
No more murders, no more curse,

1208
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:37,958
no more…

1209
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:42,375
pain.

1210
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:48,083
We can save Shadyside…

1211
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:50,250
tonight!

1212
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:07,625
My nose…

1213
01:26:08,708 --> 01:26:10,333
I bled on the hand and…

1214
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,666
I think I just saw her.

1215
01:26:13,375 --> 01:26:14,375
Who?

1216
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:16,500
Sarah Fier.

1217
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:18,833
She was…

1218
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:20,833
She was angry.

1219
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:25,083
We have to bury this thing…
right fucking now.

1220
01:27:26,666 --> 01:27:27,958
OK, let's go.

1221
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:30,916
What, I have to use my hands?

1222
01:27:31,416 --> 01:27:32,708
No, you're staying here.

1223
01:27:32,791 --> 01:27:34,958
Come on, I can hop just fine.

1224
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:43,541
I watched my dad go to jail
when I was six.

1225
01:27:45,625 --> 01:27:47,250
I watched my mom steal…

1226
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:49,250
so I could eat.

1227
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:52,541
First time I cut myself I was 12.

1228
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:54,500
It was after…

1229
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:57,750
Well, you know when.

1230
01:27:58,875 --> 01:27:59,916
And now tonight…

1231
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:03,750
I watched your perfect boyfriend

1232
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:06,708
turn into a monster

1233
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:10,583
and kill the only person I've ever loved.

1234
01:28:13,958 --> 01:28:17,250
I've waited…
my whole fucking life for this.

1235
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:19,833
And now I've found it.

1236
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:22,583
Let me see this through.

1237
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:26,708
For Arnie…

1238
01:28:27,916 --> 01:28:28,916
for Tommy…

1239
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:31,583
for Shadyside.

1240
01:28:35,666 --> 01:28:36,708
For Shadyside.

1241
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:39,583
For Shadyside.

1242
01:28:42,333 --> 01:28:43,333
Alice!

1243
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,375
Fucking die!

1244
01:28:55,458 --> 01:28:59,166
Why won't you fucking die!

1245
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:06,833
No! Alice?

1246
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:08,708
Alice?

1247
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:10,625
Alice, just…

1248
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:13,708
Just stay with me. Alice.

1249
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:20,625
No.

1250
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:22,500
Alice!

1251
01:29:23,416 --> 01:29:24,541
Alice!

1252
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:35,541
What is that?

1253
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:07,833
Ziggy!

1254
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:08,916
Help me!

1255
01:30:20,291 --> 01:30:21,916
There it is! Go, go!

1256
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:26,833
- Here?
- Yes!

1257
01:30:26,916 --> 01:30:28,333
Dig! Dig!

1258
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:36,250
Cindy?

1259
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,791
Just keep digging!

1260
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:55,833
I hit something.

1261
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,833
The witch forever lives.

1262
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:07,208
The witch forever lives.

1263
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:11,125
- Cindy, what does it mean? Cindy?
- I don't know.

1264
01:31:11,208 --> 01:31:13,625
- Where is she? Where's the body?
- I don't know.

1265
01:31:17,833 --> 01:31:19,125
This way. Come on!

1266
01:31:35,333 --> 01:31:36,958
What do you want, Sarah Fier?

1267
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:41,208
You want this? You can have it!

1268
01:31:41,291 --> 01:31:45,000
Just let my sister live!
Just let my sister live!

1269
01:31:50,291 --> 01:31:53,750
You bled on the bone.
They're after you.

1270
01:31:53,833 --> 01:31:54,958
Get ready to run.

1271
01:31:55,041 --> 01:31:57,166
- No, Cindy, no! No, Cindy!
- Let's go!

1272
01:32:10,416 --> 01:32:11,708
No!

1273
01:32:11,791 --> 01:32:13,250
No!

1274
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:05,833
Nothing will pull us apart.

1275
01:33:05,916 --> 01:33:08,583
Never again.

1276
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,250
<i>That was July 19th, 1978.</i>

1277
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:56,791
<i>Five thousand, nine hundred
and thirty-seven days ago.</i>

1278
01:33:57,458 --> 01:33:59,041
<i>My sister was dead…</i>

1279
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:01,916
<i>and so was I.</i>

1280
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:04,125
Ziggy!

1281
01:34:07,083 --> 01:34:08,583
No! Hey, hey!

1282
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:10,166
Don't die on me, OK?

1283
01:34:17,166 --> 01:34:19,333
Come on, come on, come on!

1284
01:34:24,208 --> 01:34:25,958
Come on. Come on!

1285
01:34:35,416 --> 01:34:36,500
Breathe.

1286
01:34:37,333 --> 01:34:38,375
<i>And most days…</i>

1287
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:42,041
<i>I wish I'd stayed dead.</i>

1288
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:49,541
Come on!

1289
01:34:54,666 --> 01:34:55,666
Wait…

1290
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,416
Wait, you're Ziggy?

1291
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:05,166
Hey, what's your name?
Look at me. What's your name?

1292
01:35:07,166 --> 01:35:08,166
Ziggy.

1293
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:10,750
It's Christine.

1294
01:35:11,708 --> 01:35:14,166
Her real name, it's Christine Berman.

1295
01:35:16,875 --> 01:35:19,250
Where's my… Where's my sister?

1296
01:35:27,291 --> 01:35:28,291
<i>Cindy…</i>

1297
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:31,125
<i>my sister…</i>

1298
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:35,041
<i>She sacrificed herself for nothing.</i>

1299
01:35:36,833 --> 01:35:39,458
I told everyone the story of how she died.

1300
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,625
The story I just told you.

1301
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:44,375
And no one believed me.

1302
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:48,041
And Nick?

1303
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:50,958
<i>It was her.</i>

1304
01:35:52,708 --> 01:35:55,208
Sarah Fier, the witch.

1305
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:58,000
The curse, it's…

1306
01:35:58,791 --> 01:35:59,791
it's real.

1307
01:36:01,875 --> 01:36:03,435
<i>I thought he was different.</i>

1308
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:05,916
<i>I thought he would believe me.</i>

1309
01:36:07,208 --> 01:36:09,333
<i>But Nick had a destiny in this town.</i>

1310
01:36:10,333 --> 01:36:13,541
<i>And you don't become sheriff
talking about ghost stories.</i>

1311
01:36:17,458 --> 01:36:19,125
What the hell happened here?

1312
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:26,416
He just went crazy.

1313
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,125
Fucking Shadysiders.

1314
01:36:39,583 --> 01:36:41,583
<i>I couldn't see him again.</i>

1315
01:36:41,666 --> 01:36:43,041
Not after that.

1316
01:36:53,916 --> 01:36:54,916
<i>The witch…</i>

1317
01:36:58,125 --> 01:36:59,416
<i>The town curse…</i>

1318
01:37:04,041 --> 01:37:07,791
<i>For one night, Cindy believed
that there was a way to end it.</i>

1319
01:37:10,041 --> 01:37:11,750
<i>So I thought there was too.</i>

1320
01:37:14,708 --> 01:37:15,916
<i>But now I know…</i>

1321
01:37:21,666 --> 01:37:22,916
there is no end.

1322
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:36,291
Like I said, your best chance
is to run from this place.

1323
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:39,333
Go as far as you can, hope a bus
doesn't hit you on the way out.

1324
01:37:39,416 --> 01:37:40,625
We found the body

1325
01:37:40,708 --> 01:37:44,625
off Highway 5 in the woods
between Shadyside and Sunnyvale.

1326
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:46,208
It's not possible.

1327
01:37:46,291 --> 01:37:48,166
Oh, it's there. Trust us.

1328
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,875
The chains, the bones, the whole thing.

1329
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:51,958
That could be anyone.

1330
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,708
Why do you think our friends died?

1331
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:59,041
For the same reason they killed Alice,
your sister.

1332
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:03,500
The killers came after us because we found
something they didn't want us to find.

1333
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:06,041
And I wish to God that it never happened,

1334
01:38:06,125 --> 01:38:08,000
but we found it.

1335
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:12,833
We found what you were looking for in '78.

1336
01:38:14,791 --> 01:38:16,375
We found Sarah Fier.

1337
01:38:17,708 --> 01:38:20,208
Look, please, we… Nurse Lane was right.

1338
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:23,541
We can end the curse
by reuniting the hand with the body.

1339
01:38:23,625 --> 01:38:26,625
And we know where the body is,
so all we need is the hand.

1340
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:30,375
What happened to Camp Nightwing?
Is the hand bone still there?

1341
01:38:30,458 --> 01:38:33,125
Is it still buried
underneath the Hanging Tree?

1342
01:39:03,541 --> 01:39:05,291
<i>Union County Sheriff's Department.</i>

1343
01:39:05,375 --> 01:39:08,916
I need to talk to Nick…
Sheriff Goode.

1344
01:39:10,916 --> 01:39:12,541
<i>Sheriff, do you copy?</i>

1345
01:39:13,041 --> 01:39:14,500
Copy, what you got?

1346
01:39:14,583 --> 01:39:17,458
<i>Someone called for you.</i>
<i>Says it's an emergency.</i>

1347
01:39:17,541 --> 01:39:21,833
<i>Says that you two used to be
in a Judy Blume book club together?</i>

1348
01:39:22,666 --> 01:39:24,083
<i>Is that a real thing, boss?</i>

1349
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:28,416
<i>Hey, uh… Nicky, you there?</i>

1350
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:31,875
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

1351
01:39:47,666 --> 01:39:49,916
- Lock the doors.
- No, I'm coming with you!

1352
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,083
- No! You're not.
- Deena…

1353
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:55,666
Your nose is bleeding.

1354
01:40:01,375 --> 01:40:02,375
I'll be right back.

1355
01:40:02,875 --> 01:40:04,916
Wait. Deena! Deena!

1356
01:40:29,166 --> 01:40:30,708
I got you…

1357
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,000
you witch.

1358
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:35,750
It's over.

1359
01:40:36,333 --> 01:40:37,416
It's over.

1360
01:41:00,625 --> 01:41:01,625
Sarah!

1361
01:41:02,375 --> 01:41:03,583
Sarah Fier!

1362
01:41:22,375 --> 01:41:23,375
The Devil has come.

1363
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,166
And cast his Darkness over us.

1364
01:41:32,541 --> 01:41:34,875
This Darkness grows within each of us.

1365
01:42:02,625 --> 01:42:03,958
The Devil has come.

1366
01:42:04,791 --> 01:42:07,875
You see it now… don't you?
