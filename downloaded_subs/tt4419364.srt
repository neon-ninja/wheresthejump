1
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:39,655
- All right, up you go, Max!
- Yeah! Up you go, Maxi-pad!

2
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:42,424
Knock it off, Heidi.

3
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,902
Oh, my God.

4
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:13,152
Here we go, Max! Bring me that brick!

5
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:15,791
Come on now!

6
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:22,993
Maxi-pad! Maxi-pad! Maxi-pad!

7
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:57,522
<i>You know what you have to do, Maxi.</i>

8
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,469
Looks like someone wants a kiss!

9
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:21,030
- Well?
- Well, what? He loves me.

10
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,869
- He didn't give you detention?
- Detention? Please, girl.

11
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:30,509
How he gon' give me detention when he
knows we gon' set this up on Friday!

12
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:36,482
No, Valentine's... Valentine's is tonight.
Why would we go Friday?

13
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:41,384
Well, I can't do Friday.

14
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:44,645
Well, no, you know, the talent show.

15
00:05:44,987 --> 00:05:49,174
No, no, the talent show that
the kids organized for my operation.

16
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:54,564
Did you really think
Mr. Rockwell was trying

17
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:58,437
to kiss your little rat lips?

18
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:07,944
Hey! I'm talking to you, Maxi-pad.

19
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:11,047
No, no, I know, but, you know,
it's a nice gesture,

20
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:13,665
you know how much these kids love me.

21
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:17,854
Not like that.
No, they look up to me, Kim, all right.

22
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:21,257
And I'd be a real jerk to ditch out on
my own fundraiser, don't you think?

23
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:25,461
You really think he'd go for you?

24
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:27,497
Over me?

25
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:31,968
Just wait until he sees the twerking routine
we came up with for the talent show.

26
00:06:32,068 --> 00:06:34,437
Real Nicki Minaj shit.

27
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:37,173
That's fine. No, no, no,
you know what, that's great.

28
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:39,845
Yeah, I love you too.

29
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:58,261
What are you doing to get him a new heart?

30
00:06:58,361 --> 00:07:00,430
Did you organize a talent show?

31
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,390
Are you gonna perform something?

32
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:09,005
I know. How about a little
game of show and tell?

33
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:13,643
First you show everybody
your little friend, Mr. Box Cutter.

34
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:17,713
And then just watch
as those donations pour in

35
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:23,986
when you tell them it's the same toy
your dear, dead daddy

36
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:26,525
killed himself with.

37
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,471
I gotta meet Rick.

38
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,951
- You're not going to go take a shower?
- No, I'll take one at home.

39
00:07:53,782 --> 00:07:58,390
I heard this one has rats in it.

40
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,357
Stop following me, Maxi-pad.

41
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:09,080
You're acting really weird today,
even for you.

42
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:13,885
Well, go ahead.

43
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:24,962
Well, I'm gonna cut through the woods.
See you tomorrow.

44
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:29,568
Happy Valentine's day.

45
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:53,158
What are you doing?

46
00:11:58,526 --> 00:12:01,433
You don't even live this way.

47
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:07,889
Stop following me.

48
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:20,485
Now look what you did!

49
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:55,820
I... I was just kidding.

50
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:30,186
- We're going to be late.
- Well, I thought I had until Friday.

51
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:34,693
Why would you think that?
Valentine's day is tonight!

52
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:28,144
<i>Shamrocks. Irish dancing.
Parades of green.</i>

53
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:32,984
<i>These are some of the images that come to
mind when we think of St. Patrick's day.</i>

54
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,660
<i>But who exactly was St. Patrick?</i>

55
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,463
<i>And how did he deliver
the word of God to Ireland?</i>

56
00:14:47,563 --> 00:14:52,200
<i>A land once in the grip of druids,
pagans, and devil worshippers?</i>

57
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,252
<i>According to legend, Patrick
banished all of the snakes from Ireland</i>

58
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,402
<i>by tossing them into the sea.</i>

59
00:14:57,502 --> 00:15:01,544
<i>Although evidence suggests there were no
snakes in Ireland during the 5th century.</i>

60
00:15:01,644 --> 00:15:04,380
<i>Most scholars believe this
to be a metaphor.</i>

61
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,050
<i>St. Patrick's expulsion
of the pagans and mystics.</i>

62
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,902
<i>Long may Ireland let slip from memory
its paganistic days of old.</i>

63
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,711
Hiya, Grainne.

64
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,083
That's very pretty. Who is it for?

65
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:28,652
Okay.

66
00:15:29,103 --> 00:15:32,325
Look. I know how hard change is,

67
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:35,362
coming to a new school,
not having any friends.

68
00:15:35,611 --> 00:15:39,181
But I bet if you were to show us
that smile just for a second,

69
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:43,166
it would make all the difference
in the world.

70
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:47,222
Do you know what? I have an idea.

71
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,508
Would you like to ring the lunch bell?

72
00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:57,943
<i>Hiya, it's me. I can't chat for long.
I'm here waiting for Sam.</i>

73
00:16:58,043 --> 00:17:02,357
<i>He's insisted I park away from the school
because apparently I'm not cool.</i>

74
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,512
<i>He's like, "mum, it's not
authentic if I smile."</i>

75
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:12,155
<i>Yeah, it's your holy communion photo,
not the dogme 95 movement.</i>

76
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:22,631
<i>My doctor actually recommended
I get new contact lenses</i>

77
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:25,220
<i>with "hope" printed on the insides.</i>

78
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,823
<i>Apparently clinical trials
suggest it may help</i>

79
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:31,059
<i>the cynical wheel
of self-loathing from turning.</i>

80
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:33,877
<i>I hate myself.</i>

81
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:38,734
<i>Anyway, I can't wait to see you
this weekend for paddy's day.</i>

82
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:42,086
<i>We'll get fucked up, yeah? Find you a man?</i>

83
00:18:01,704 --> 00:18:04,398
<i>Liz, where are ya? I went back to
the bar but there was no sign of you</i>

84
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:07,096
<i>and that Danny Zuko wannabe
you were talking to.</i>

85
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:09,791
<i>Would you call me, you think?</i>

86
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:16,171
I'd like you to pick your favorite book,

87
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:19,809
write a page about why you like it,
and score the book out of ten.

88
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:23,145
Hand in date is two weeks from today.

89
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:27,464
Okay, everybody, page 38, circles.

90
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:53,607
Fuck! Hiya, Grainne.

91
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,627
What?

92
00:19:03,985 --> 00:19:08,312
Now, hang on.
That's not very appropriate, Grainne.

93
00:19:32,513 --> 00:19:34,698
Mrs. Cullen?

94
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,338
- You are pregnant.
- I fucking knew it!

95
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:43,799
I just can't believe it!

96
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:48,497
- I've waited so long for this.
- However, we're not certain with what.

97
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:52,367
Well, if it's a boy or a girl,
that doesn't matter to me.

98
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,670
We'd like to run some further tests.

99
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,157
Although, if the results
indicate a false positive,

100
00:19:58,257 --> 00:20:02,844
we'd need to operate immediately
and remove... it.

101
00:20:03,044 --> 00:20:05,247
I'm pregnant.

102
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,919
Did... did you understand what I said?

103
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:15,724
It's totally grand, boy or girl, whatever
I get, I'm happy. I am so happy.

104
00:20:15,824 --> 00:20:20,503
Were you with somebody recently,
or some animal of some kind?

105
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:21,830
No.

106
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,568
Okay, have you ever seen
the Hollywood movie Rosemary's Baby?

107
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:32,022
- Yeah.
- If you replace "baby" with "reptile"...

108
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:38,695
that's what you have.
It's like Rosemary's reptile.

109
00:21:03,437 --> 00:21:05,955
Grainne, what is this?

110
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:09,293
Grainne, what is this?

111
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:12,563
Grainne, what is this?

112
00:21:35,136 --> 00:21:37,520
Stop smiling!

113
00:21:55,243 --> 00:21:56,558
<i>Nan just called.</i>

114
00:21:56,658 --> 00:21:59,461
<i>She says you look like a 25-year-old
woman from the middle ages,</i>

115
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:02,431
<i>spliced with a mentally ill circle.</i>

116
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:08,051
<i>I'm booking an appointment with Dublin zoo.
There's no excuses this time, Liz.</i>

117
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:27,837
Hi, can I help you with anything?

118
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:42,170
I'm... I'm really sorry.
That's not really, that's...

119
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,787
That's not really okay.

120
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,051
I'm sorry.
I'm just going to have to take that.

121
00:22:56,151 --> 00:22:59,136
I'm sorry. You're going to have to leave.

122
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,221
<i>What the fuck are you thinking, Liz?</i>

123
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:13,958
<i>The zoo just called, they said you never
turned up for your appointment.</i>

124
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:17,673
<i>I know you're probably saying to yourself,
"what if the vet's got it wrong?"</i>

125
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:21,976
<i>Let me impart some important advice
I learned a long time ago, the hard way.</i>

126
00:23:22,076 --> 00:23:25,094
<i>Vets don't get things wrong.</i>

127
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:28,650
<i>Giving birth to a snake
is not only suicide,</i>

128
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,620
<i>it's probably the most
wrong-headed thing ever attempted</i>

129
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,723
<i>in the field of human endeavor.</i>

130
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:40,661
<i>The only thing you have to do to make
our family happy is just come home.</i>

131
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:42,041
<i>Alone.</i>

132
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:10,542
It'll all be over soon, I promise.

133
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:15,329
I need you to help me
get clean of this, okay?

134
00:25:50,891 --> 00:25:53,309
Horrible, isn't it?

135
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:56,898
You cannot remember.

136
00:25:56,998 --> 00:25:59,682
But you can't forget.

137
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,075
Grainne...

138
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:06,352
this is your father?

139
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:11,494
Danny fucking Zuko?

140
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:15,432
Our little boy is waiting.

141
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:21,456
Look, I know you think she's different,
but she's not.

142
00:26:21,556 --> 00:26:26,369
She'll run a mile when she claps eyes
on him. Just wanted a normal baby.

143
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,246
It's not fair.

144
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:34,436
But just look how quickly she forgets.
Don't make me laugh.

145
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:37,314
She's the same as the rest of them.

146
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:42,792
I'm so sorry.

147
00:26:45,863 --> 00:26:47,949
I had no idea.

148
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:51,285
He'd be so damn ugly.

149
00:26:51,385 --> 00:26:53,671
You'd be so beautiful.

150
00:27:11,272 --> 00:27:14,625
Very good, little one. Very good.

151
00:27:14,725 --> 00:27:16,876
Let's go!

152
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:22,551
I bet there's a whole lotta
disenchanted folk out there

153
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:27,971
just waiting for a bouncing snake
to lighten up their lives.

154
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:35,797
I bet if we tap into that lonely
miserable demographic,

155
00:27:35,897 --> 00:27:38,367
in a few short years and a bit of luck,

156
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:42,151
we might just hit pre-Patrick numbers.

157
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,878
Time to close your eyes and go to sleep.

158
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:43,365
It's a special day tomorrow.
Someone's coming tonight.

159
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:45,066
I'll give you a hint.

160
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:48,135
He's furry.

161
00:28:48,235 --> 00:28:50,437
And he hops.

162
00:28:50,537 --> 00:28:54,475
And you wake up in the morning
and you get...

163
00:28:54,575 --> 00:28:58,346
- Candy eggs and candy chicks.
- Yes. But here's the thing.

164
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:00,448
No kid has ever seen him.

165
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:04,819
Because all the kids are supposed
to be asleep when he comes. Okay?

166
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:08,945
- Okay.
- Okay. Close your eyes.

167
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,378
Wait.

168
00:29:14,328 --> 00:29:17,824
- I'm scared.
- Why?

169
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:21,183
Are you afraid you're going
to have a bad dream?

170
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:25,022
The man coming back from the dead.

171
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,158
What man?

172
00:29:27,608 --> 00:29:29,778
Jesus.

173
00:29:29,878 --> 00:29:34,616
In church they said that Easter was
about him coming back from being dead.

174
00:29:34,716 --> 00:29:38,653
What about the Easter bunny?
Is he dead too?

175
00:29:38,753 --> 00:29:41,922
No, the Easter bunny's different.

176
00:29:42,022 --> 00:29:46,010
- Is Jesus real?
- Yeah, he was real.

177
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:50,948
- He was?
- Yeah. But he was a good man.

178
00:29:51,198 --> 00:29:54,243
And you know what? Yes, he died,

179
00:29:54,343 --> 00:29:57,672
but when he came back,
that was a good thing.

180
00:29:57,772 --> 00:30:00,208
It was a miracle that he came back.

181
00:30:00,308 --> 00:30:02,536
He flew up into the stars

182
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:05,613
and he went back where he came from.

183
00:30:05,713 --> 00:30:08,665
And he lives in our hearts now.

184
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:13,570
It's kind of like a scary version of E.T.

185
00:30:14,656 --> 00:30:17,374
Yeah, but he wasn't a story, he was real.

186
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,098
- What about the Easter bunny?
- Well, the Easter bunny comes on Easter.

187
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:28,384
But I thought that's when Jesus
came back from the dead.

188
00:30:31,738 --> 00:30:35,143
- No, it's... that's different.
- I don't understand, mommy.

189
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:38,179
Honey, just close your eyes
and go to sleep.

190
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,690
And tomorrow you are going to wake up

191
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,518
and there will be candy chicks
and eggs and yummy stuff.

192
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:46,488
But what if I'm awake when he comes?

193
00:30:46,588 --> 00:30:51,025
- What if I get up and get a glass of water?
- It's okay to get a glass of water.

194
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:55,496
No, but what if he's here?
What if I see him?

195
00:30:55,596 --> 00:30:58,331
Honey. Just go to sleep.

196
00:30:58,431 --> 00:31:00,451
Mommy.

197
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:03,854
How does he get in the house?

198
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:06,155
Okay.

199
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,128
I'm gonna count to three,
and I want those eyes shut.

200
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,597
All right? One.

201
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:16,733
Two.

202
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:21,170
Three.

203
00:31:22,956 --> 00:31:28,044
You're going to wake up tomorrow and
it's going to be exactly like last year.

204
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,985
Mommy?

205
00:31:37,971 --> 00:31:40,808
Last year, Daddy was here.

206
00:31:40,908 --> 00:31:43,993
Will he ever come back?

207
00:31:46,213 --> 00:31:47,798
Maybe.

208
00:31:48,148 --> 00:31:50,733
Go to sleep, baby.

209
00:33:35,088 --> 00:33:37,073
Mommy?

210
00:36:18,418 --> 00:36:21,004
This is a dream.

211
00:36:21,354 --> 00:36:23,839
You're not real.

212
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,288
Touch me.

213
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:13,889
No child has ever seen me.

214
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:19,412
I won't... I won't tell anyone
I saw you. I promise.

215
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:23,899
But now that you've seen me.
Now it is your turn.

216
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:28,188
You must take my place.

217
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,274
Take... take your place?

218
00:37:31,992 --> 00:37:36,812
You will see things few have ever seen.

219
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:40,433
Magical things.

220
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:44,153
But what if... what if I don't want to?

221
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,456
You have no choice.

222
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:53,896
Can I... can I come back and see my mommy?

223
00:37:56,449 --> 00:37:59,782
Where you're going,
you will never see your mommy

224
00:37:59,882 --> 00:38:03,357
ever, ever again.

225
00:38:27,564 --> 00:38:30,683
Now close your eyes.

226
00:39:21,434 --> 00:39:23,452
Honey?

227
00:39:24,437 --> 00:39:26,455
Honey?

228
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:32,094
Honey?

229
00:40:11,484 --> 00:40:15,122
You know, there are only
a few days in any woman's cycle

230
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:18,726
where she's capable of conceiving.

231
00:40:18,826 --> 00:40:23,279
And you're on,
generic high dose progestin?

232
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,362
Do you take it at the same time
every day? You're sure?

233
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,688
He wears two condoms.

234
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:35,242
I ask him to wear two condoms.
Sometimes three.

235
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:51,726
And you've terminated
nearly 20 pregnancies?

236
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:53,877
I've stopped counting.

237
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:55,897
- I'm sorry, I...
- It's okay.

238
00:40:55,997 --> 00:40:58,265
I've been to see so many doctors.

239
00:40:58,365 --> 00:41:01,551
My family won't talk to me.

240
00:41:01,701 --> 00:41:05,072
My friends think I'm insane,

241
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:08,324
or making it up, or just...

242
00:41:13,045 --> 00:41:15,064
It's...

243
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:21,003
It's like I'm cursed.

244
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,227
I don't usually do this.

245
00:41:26,327 --> 00:41:29,664
But it does feel like
you've exhausted all other options.

246
00:41:29,764 --> 00:41:32,666
I'm going to give you
my sister's phone number.

247
00:41:32,766 --> 00:41:38,639
She volunteers at these weekend
fertility ceremonies in the high desert.

248
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:43,244
Maybe she can give you some sort of insight
that the rest of us haven't been able to.

249
00:41:43,344 --> 00:41:46,361
Thank you. Thank you.

250
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:50,151
It's probably not for me,
but I appreciate it.

251
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:53,054
Kate, if what you've told me is true

252
00:41:53,154 --> 00:41:56,868
then I don't think
conventional medicine can help you.

253
00:42:07,434 --> 00:42:09,637
<i>What happens at the ceremony?</i>

254
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:13,707
<i>Well, have you ever participated
in a peyote ceremony</i>

255
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:17,645
<i>or ayahuasca,
or any kind of ceremonial medicine?</i>

256
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:19,114
<i>Well, no.</i>

257
00:42:19,214 --> 00:42:22,606
<i>It can be an intense experience.</i>

258
00:42:23,786 --> 00:42:28,737
<i>But if you're open to it, I think
that you can really learn something.</i>

259
00:42:35,395 --> 00:42:37,798
I know I'm going
to get pregnant this time.

260
00:42:37,898 --> 00:42:41,752
I know it. Sometimes it takes many times
to come here before you do.

261
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:45,773
I think you have to let go of the trying.
- - Yeah, I get nervous sometimes.

262
00:42:45,873 --> 00:42:50,626
Make yourself at home.
The ceremony will start in an hour.

263
00:42:54,314 --> 00:42:55,583
How old are you?

264
00:42:55,683 --> 00:42:58,386
- Twenty-four.
- What's the rush?

265
00:42:58,486 --> 00:43:01,539
I'm actually not trying
to have a baby right now.

266
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:04,322
Then what are you doing here?

267
00:43:04,524 --> 00:43:07,543
I get pregnant every time I have sex.

268
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,046
Sounds rough.

269
00:44:51,265 --> 00:44:53,367
You...

270
00:44:53,467 --> 00:44:57,101
are a gateway.

271
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:02,457
I have to go home.
No, I have to get out of here.

272
00:45:04,177 --> 00:45:06,213
I have to go home.
No, I don't want to be here.

273
00:45:06,313 --> 00:45:08,922
It's just the medicine.

274
00:45:09,743 --> 00:45:13,056
Just trust it. It's just the medicine.

275
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:21,562
Every time you end the life inside of you,

276
00:45:21,662 --> 00:45:24,813
it will come back stronger.

277
00:46:38,939 --> 00:46:40,507
<i>Sleep.</i>

278
00:46:40,607 --> 00:46:42,942
<i>Sleep, little bird.</i>

279
00:46:43,042 --> 00:46:46,412
<i>When the time comes do not resist.</i>

280
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,765
<i>Do not say no.</i>

281
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,669
Good morning, sleepyhead.

282
00:48:01,687 --> 00:48:04,540
Do you want a bath today?

283
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,342
Yeah.

284
00:48:07,627 --> 00:48:09,645
Okay.

285
00:48:10,196 --> 00:48:14,883
One, two, three, up.

286
00:48:16,802 --> 00:48:18,820
Okay.

287
00:48:29,148 --> 00:48:32,367
You're gonna be such a good mama.

288
00:48:32,718 --> 00:48:35,670
You've been very patient.

289
00:48:51,003 --> 00:48:53,240
I think we need to increase her dose.

290
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,276
No, we can't give her
more than three drops.

291
00:48:56,376 --> 00:48:58,927
It's not good for the baby.

292
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,883
Lily, she's fine.

293
00:49:02,983 --> 00:49:06,001
- Morning.
- Sister.

294
00:49:06,686 --> 00:49:11,924
- Started getting so hot out there.
- Yeah, it always heats up in May.

295
00:49:12,024 --> 00:49:16,645
Happy mother's day, mama.
We're almost there.

296
00:49:27,773 --> 00:49:31,011
Blood pressure is a little high.

297
00:49:31,111 --> 00:49:34,498
- Has anybody tried calling her phone?
- No, poor girl.

298
00:49:34,748 --> 00:49:36,183
How's she been this week?

299
00:49:36,283 --> 00:49:40,187
Not so good. I mean, we could
use you around here more often.

300
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:43,455
Well, I can't spend all my time out here,
I'm going back and forth enough as it is.

301
00:49:43,555 --> 00:49:45,692
You don't know what it's like here.
It's really hard.

302
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:47,794
I am here every weekend.
I'm going back and forth.

303
00:49:47,894 --> 00:49:50,731
Yeah, I think you should stay with her
from here on out. It's the last month.

304
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:53,600
I can't take a whole month
off of work, Lily.

305
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,684
- God damn it, you idiot!
- Don't yell at her.

306
00:49:56,784 --> 00:49:59,172
No wonder she has high blood pressure,
living here with you guys.

307
00:49:59,272 --> 00:50:04,883
- She can't hear us anyways.
- Come. Come with me. Come on.

308
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,301
Okay.

309
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:18,958
Classical or contemporary today?

310
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:22,110
I'm feeling contemporary.

311
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:56,329
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

312
00:50:56,429 --> 00:51:01,516
My name is Kate Polson.

313
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:05,973
I'm... I've been kidnapped.

314
00:51:06,073 --> 00:51:08,508
<i>I can't hear you, miss, can you speak up?</i>

315
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:10,477
I need help.

316
00:51:10,577 --> 00:51:16,698
- <i>Fire, ambulance, or police?</i>
- Police, please. Please hurry.

317
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:19,135
<i>What's the address?</i>

318
00:51:22,155 --> 00:51:26,880
It's like, it's a house.
Ten miles north of the highway...

319
00:51:33,098 --> 00:51:35,550
Oh, God!

320
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:44,677
Be careful.

321
00:51:44,777 --> 00:51:46,929
Careful!

322
00:51:49,348 --> 00:51:51,919
- That was stupid, look what you did!
- What's happening?

323
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:54,154
She's going in to labor,
that's what's happening.

324
00:51:54,254 --> 00:51:55,989
God. Okay.

325
00:51:56,089 --> 00:51:59,374
Just breathe. Just breathe.

326
00:52:00,192 --> 00:52:03,545
The more you accept it,
the easier it will be.

327
00:52:04,465 --> 00:52:08,783
All right, come on, just push.
Push for me.

328
00:52:10,703 --> 00:52:12,372
Good girl.

329
00:52:12,472 --> 00:52:17,845
Push, Kate. Push.
Almost there, almost there.

330
00:53:08,527 --> 00:53:10,230
Probably not.

331
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:14,015
Yeah, I'm going to be here
grading these papers all weekend.

332
00:53:15,134 --> 00:53:17,255
Yeah, I know, it's 52 this year.

333
00:54:36,415 --> 00:54:38,900
<i>Hi, Carol.</i>

334
00:54:39,618 --> 00:54:43,371
<i>It's me. Your daddy.</i>

335
00:54:45,224 --> 00:54:49,677
<i>I'm so sorry. Daddy had to leave you.</i>

336
00:54:50,095 --> 00:54:54,349
<i>I never loved anything more than you.</i>

337
00:54:56,302 --> 00:54:58,888
<i>You were my miracle.</i>

338
00:54:59,238 --> 00:55:03,791
<i>I wanted so badly for you to come with me.</i>

339
00:55:04,276 --> 00:55:07,028
<i>For us to be together.</i>

340
00:55:08,414 --> 00:55:10,751
<i>Your mother and I,</i>

341
00:55:10,851 --> 00:55:15,036
<i>we just didn't see things the same way.</i>

342
00:55:15,387 --> 00:55:21,026
<i>It's so important that you know
it wasn't your fault.</i>

343
00:55:21,126 --> 00:55:25,429
<i>And that you know that I am so...</i>

344
00:55:25,529 --> 00:55:29,951
<i>so sorry I wasn't there for you.</i>

345
00:55:35,975 --> 00:55:38,311
<i>If you're hearing this message,</i>

346
00:55:38,411 --> 00:55:42,114
<i>I... I can't imagine the pain</i>

347
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:44,684
<i>that I've caused you.</i>

348
00:55:44,784 --> 00:55:49,771
<i>But it's not too late
for us to be together.</i>

349
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:54,027
<i>I left this message in trust
with good people.</i>

350
00:55:54,127 --> 00:55:58,397
<i>I told them to give this to you
when you were old enough,</i>

351
00:55:58,497 --> 00:56:00,901
<i>strong enough.</i>

352
00:56:01,001 --> 00:56:04,619
<i>I didn't want
to leave you there all alone.</i>

353
00:56:05,637 --> 00:56:08,457
<i>It wasn't my choice.</i>

354
00:56:08,807 --> 00:56:12,277
<i>So... if you want to see me,</i>

355
00:56:12,377 --> 00:56:16,783
<i>to find me, continue where we left off,</i>

356
00:56:16,883 --> 00:56:21,520
<i>I can be there for you now.
If you're ready.</i>

357
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:24,290
<i>Just go to where we played that day,</i>

358
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,593
<i>our last day together.</i>

359
00:56:26,693 --> 00:56:30,363
<i>Go there, turn the tape over,</i>

360
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:35,016
<i>press play and I will guide you.</i>

361
00:56:35,234 --> 00:56:38,805
<i>You will always be my baby,
no matter what you choose.</i>

362
00:56:38,905 --> 00:56:43,509
<i>I just hope you'll have it
in you to forgive me.</i>

363
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:48,296
<i>Remember, Daddy loves you forever, Carol.</i>

364
00:56:52,825 --> 00:56:57,204
This isn't fair. This isn't fucking fair.

365
00:56:57,757 --> 00:57:01,226
How could you do this to me, Mom?

366
00:57:01,326 --> 00:57:05,065
All these years? He was alive?

367
00:57:05,165 --> 00:57:07,982
I missed him so much.

368
00:57:09,034 --> 00:57:12,688
You fucking call me back
the minute you get this.

369
00:57:12,938 --> 00:57:14,956
Bitch!

370
00:58:38,323 --> 00:58:42,761
- <i>Carol! Come on, baby, it's time to go!</i>
- <i>Five more minutes?</i>

371
00:58:42,861 --> 00:58:46,132
<i>Okay, five more minutes,
then we have to go.</i>

372
00:58:46,232 --> 00:58:48,449
<i>Okay!</i>

373
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,972
<i>Hello, Carol.</i>

374
00:58:52,072 --> 00:58:55,542
<i>I hope that you've come,
and are ready to see me again.</i>

375
00:58:55,642 --> 00:58:59,185
<i>Listen carefully,
and I'll help you find me.</i>

376
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:03,383
- <i>I'm ready, Daddy.</i>
- <i>Yeah, okay, you got your backpack?</i>

377
00:59:03,483 --> 00:59:05,501
<i>Yeah.</i>

378
00:59:06,785 --> 00:59:09,622
<i>Hey, let's go this way today, okay?</i>

379
00:59:09,722 --> 00:59:14,327
- <i>Where are we going?</i>
- <i>First we're going towards the exit.</i>

380
00:59:14,427 --> 00:59:17,864
<i>Then we are headed south,
on Revelle Avenue.</i>

381
00:59:17,964 --> 00:59:20,600
<i>South? Where's south?</i>

382
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:25,487
<i>It's this way.
Come, let's hold hands while crossing.</i>

383
00:59:28,307 --> 00:59:30,877
<i>How come you're carrying that?</i>

384
00:59:30,977 --> 00:59:34,146
<i>I'm making a message for a friend.</i>

385
00:59:34,246 --> 00:59:36,582
<i>Do I know them?</i>

386
00:59:36,682 --> 00:59:40,067
<i>Yes, honey. You know them.</i>

387
00:59:40,485 --> 00:59:43,105
Turn right on third.

388
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:48,175
- <i>What's it say?</i>
- <i>Just where to find us.</i>

389
00:59:48,593 --> 00:59:50,495
<i>Why?</i>

390
00:59:50,595 --> 00:59:53,213
<i>Because they need help.</i>

391
00:59:57,936 --> 01:00:00,440
<i>Look at this, Dad!</i>

392
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,858
<i>That's a good looking stick.</i>

393
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:06,011
<i>It looks like a magic wand.</i>

394
01:00:06,111 --> 01:00:08,930
<i>It does look magic.</i>

395
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:18,257
- <i>How much further?</i>
- <i>We're almost there.</i>

396
01:00:18,357 --> 01:00:22,028
<i>Go left at Marmont coming up.</i>

397
01:00:22,128 --> 01:00:26,047
<i>I promise this will all
make sense in the end.</i>

398
01:00:27,099 --> 01:00:32,219
<i>Walk to 433 Marmont.</i>

399
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:36,742
<i>You know that I love you very much, right?</i>

400
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,812
<i>I love you too, Daddy.</i>

401
01:00:38,912 --> 01:00:42,282
<i>And that I only want what is best for us.</i>

402
01:00:42,382 --> 01:00:44,917
<i>That's why I picked you up today, honey.</i>

403
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:47,554
<i>Daddy has to go somewhere</i>

404
01:00:47,654 --> 01:00:50,690
<i>and I needed to see you before I left.</i>

405
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:55,995
- <i>Where are you going?</i>
- <i>I'm going to a very special place.</i>

406
01:00:56,095 --> 01:00:59,365
<i>But don't worry,
you'll come and visit me soon.</i>

407
01:00:59,465 --> 01:01:01,968
<i>Always remember this, Carol,</i>

408
01:01:02,068 --> 01:01:04,570
<i>the person who risks nothing,</i>

409
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:07,573
<i>has nothing, is nothing,</i>

410
01:01:07,673 --> 01:01:09,942
<i>and becomes nothing.</i>

411
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:14,346
- <i>I don't want you to go.</i>
- <i>I know.</i>

412
01:01:14,446 --> 01:01:17,064
<i>But I have to.</i>

413
01:01:17,816 --> 01:01:19,985
<i>We're here.</i>

414
01:01:20,085 --> 01:01:23,270
<i>The front door should be open.</i>

415
01:01:24,323 --> 01:01:27,444
<i>You'll come see me
as soon as you're ready.</i>

416
01:01:27,794 --> 01:01:31,512
- <i>I'm ready.</i>
- <i>I wish you were.</i>

417
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:37,018
- <i>But I'll miss you.</i>
- <i>I'll miss you more than you'll ever know.</i>

418
01:01:38,804 --> 01:01:41,824
<i>Come, we have to go inside.</i>

419
01:01:42,174 --> 01:01:45,181
<i>Here, let Daddy carry you.</i>

420
01:01:56,721 --> 01:01:59,558
<i>Why do you have to go?</i>

421
01:01:59,658 --> 01:02:01,777
<i>Be strong for Daddy.</i>

422
01:02:03,795 --> 01:02:06,573
<i>We're almost together again.</i>

423
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:10,551
<i>You are so close now.</i>

424
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:14,072
<i>What's that picture?</i>

425
01:02:14,172 --> 01:02:16,375
<i>It's called an icon.</i>

426
01:02:16,475 --> 01:02:19,247
<i>It's a symbol of faith.</i>

427
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:31,623
<i>Okay, honey, will you sit here
and wait for Daddy?</i>

428
01:02:31,723 --> 01:02:34,827
<i>I have to go talk
to that nice lady over there.</i>

429
01:02:34,927 --> 01:02:37,663
- <i>You're not going yet, are you?</i>
- <i>Not yet.</i>

430
01:02:37,763 --> 01:02:40,600
<i>I just need to talk to the lady.</i>

431
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,736
- <i>Promise?</i>
- <i>I promise.</i>

432
01:02:43,836 --> 01:02:45,372
<i>Okay.</i>

433
01:02:45,472 --> 01:02:50,191
<i>You're such a strong girl,
and I am so proud of you.</i>

434
01:02:56,948 --> 01:03:01,235
<i>I'm here for my appointment,
to speak with you.</i>

435
01:03:14,633 --> 01:03:17,002
<i>Thank you.</i>

436
01:03:17,102 --> 01:03:19,138
<i>Once I go,</i>

437
01:03:19,238 --> 01:03:23,457
<i>will you make sure
that she's taken care of?</i>

438
01:03:24,876 --> 01:03:28,213
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

439
01:03:28,313 --> 01:03:32,018
- <i>Dad! Dad!</i>
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

440
01:03:32,118 --> 01:03:36,155
<i>Daddy! Daddy!</i>

441
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:44,780
<i>It wasn't my choice, Carol.</i>

442
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,933
<i>You...</i>

443
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:51,470
<i>You only get once chance to meet him,</i>

444
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:54,154
<i>to visit this place.</i>

445
01:03:55,173 --> 01:03:58,410
<i>That's why I made this for you,</i>

446
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:02,279
<i>and I pray that it found you,</i>

447
01:04:02,914 --> 01:04:05,933
<i>so that you may find me.</i>

448
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,112
<i>I'll be so happy to see you again.</i>

449
01:04:20,966 --> 01:04:23,893
<i>It will have been so long.</i>

450
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:27,088
Dad?

451
01:04:36,114 --> 01:04:37,884
Daddy?

452
01:04:37,984 --> 01:04:40,568
<i>Hello, baby.</i>

453
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:43,222
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

454
01:04:43,322 --> 01:04:46,142
- <i>I'm so happy that you came.</i>
- Dad!

455
01:04:46,592 --> 01:04:50,128
<i>Daddy loves you so much, Carol.</i>

456
01:04:50,228 --> 01:04:52,665
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

457
01:04:52,765 --> 01:04:58,486
<i>If you have come, and you have
found me, then you are here.</i>

458
01:04:58,586 --> 01:05:02,809
- <i>You're finally here in this room...</i>
- Daddy, it's me.

459
01:05:02,909 --> 01:05:06,646
- <i>...of your own free will.</i>
- Please, Daddy.

460
01:05:06,746 --> 01:05:13,496
<i>Oh, Carol, that means that you,
and I, can be together again.</i>

461
01:05:23,094 --> 01:05:25,479
<i>Together.</i>

462
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,040
Hi, is this Shelby?

463
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,642
Yeah, you responded to my ad online.

464
01:06:10,742 --> 01:06:13,762
My name's Ian. How are you?

465
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,432
Where are you from, by the way?

466
01:06:16,582 --> 01:06:19,051
Des Moines! Oh, fuck.

467
01:06:19,151 --> 01:06:22,354
You probably want
to get out of there so badly.

468
01:06:22,454 --> 01:06:24,524
Yeah, so come to LA.

469
01:06:24,624 --> 01:06:27,627
No, it's not porn. It's webcam.

470
01:06:27,727 --> 01:06:29,996
It's honestly exactly like Facetime.

471
01:06:30,096 --> 01:06:32,632
You probably already do
the same shit with your boyfriends.

472
01:06:32,732 --> 01:06:37,018
Except now, you can get paid
while you do it. Large.

473
01:06:37,268 --> 01:06:39,672
Last week one of the girls
made eight grand.

474
01:06:39,772 --> 01:06:42,256
How's it sound to you?

475
01:06:42,807 --> 01:06:45,978
Good? Oh, that's amazing!

476
01:06:46,078 --> 01:06:48,948
That's amazing!
I'm super excited about that.

477
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:51,918
Okay, so we'll get everything
squared away immediately.

478
01:06:52,018 --> 01:06:53,853
Hi, is this Allison?

479
01:06:53,953 --> 01:06:58,424
Yeah, you responded to my ad online.
Yeah, the webcam stuff.

480
01:06:58,524 --> 01:07:02,595
No, no, no, no, it's nothing like porno.
It's nothing like porno at all.

481
01:07:02,695 --> 01:07:05,331
It's on your webcam.
It's pretty much Facetime.

482
01:07:05,431 --> 01:07:09,302
I mean, you probably already do
the same thing with your boyfriends.

483
01:07:09,402 --> 01:07:12,805
Yeah. It includes a free ticket
to the heart of Hollywood.

484
01:07:12,905 --> 01:07:16,341
You'll be set up,
staying in a beautiful apartment.

485
01:07:16,441 --> 01:07:19,970
What do you tell your parents?
I don't know. Fuck your parents.

486
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:25,952
<i>Stirring our cauldron of magic are we!</i>

487
01:07:26,052 --> 01:07:30,505
<i>A witch's power is strongest in threes.</i>

488
01:07:32,024 --> 01:07:35,794
Like, what the fuck are
these bitches cooking, man?

489
01:07:35,894 --> 01:07:40,448
They're not cooking. That's a cauldron.
They're actually casting spells.

490
01:07:43,902 --> 01:07:47,055
- I just had a fucking asshole.
- What happened?

491
01:07:49,641 --> 01:07:52,111
He was writing all this shit
that he wanted to do to me.

492
01:07:52,211 --> 01:07:55,131
And then when he signed off...

493
01:07:57,249 --> 01:07:59,150
He called me a whore!

494
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:02,054
Serenes. I'm so sorry.

495
01:08:02,154 --> 01:08:04,607
Man, what a fucking fuckhole, man.

496
01:08:04,707 --> 01:08:09,856
You got his credit card number, right?
So, fuck this asshole, let's go shopping.

497
01:08:11,029 --> 01:08:14,581
I can e-mail you
a ticket right away, Allison.

498
01:08:15,033 --> 01:08:18,958
Your boyfriend? Fuck him.
No, you'll be treated like a queen here.

499
01:08:19,058 --> 01:08:21,213
I promise.

500
01:08:21,406 --> 01:08:24,959
Okay. Bye now.

501
01:08:28,413 --> 01:08:30,382
The fuck is this?

502
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:33,319
- Nobody's working?
- Nobody's calling.

503
01:08:33,419 --> 01:08:37,475
- It's Halloween. Everyone's out partying.
- Except us.

504
01:08:37,855 --> 01:08:42,343
That's sad. Trick or treat, skank.

505
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:52,004
Did you scrape that shit out yet?
I want to eat my hot pockets.

506
01:08:52,104 --> 01:08:56,275
- Can I have one of your hot pockets?
- I gave you your dinner.

507
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:59,211
Fuck your three
for a dollar discount shit.

508
01:08:59,311 --> 01:09:03,181
What's wrong with name Brand Candy,
you ever heard of Hersheys?

509
01:09:03,281 --> 01:09:05,885
Yeah, I heard of Hershey.

510
01:09:05,985 --> 01:09:10,957
Hersheys is what my grandmother
used to say, is for ladies.

511
01:09:11,057 --> 01:09:16,026
I added this part.
Discount stuff is for whores.

512
01:09:16,126 --> 01:09:18,664
- Whores!
- What is wrong with this girl?

513
01:09:18,764 --> 01:09:22,869
Some cam asshole called her
a whore and then signed off.

514
01:09:22,969 --> 01:09:27,273
They're supposed to type dirty shit.
That's why they give us their money.

515
01:09:27,373 --> 01:09:29,742
Well, nobody's giving us
their money tonight.

516
01:09:29,842 --> 01:09:31,811
Yeah, so why don't you
give us the night off

517
01:09:31,911 --> 01:09:36,330
so we can cheer Serena up
and celebrate Halloween?

518
01:09:38,683 --> 01:09:40,701
Okay.

519
01:09:41,653 --> 01:09:45,491
Oh, no, wait. Wait.
I meant to say, fuck no.

520
01:09:45,591 --> 01:09:46,926
Don't be a dick, Ian.

521
01:09:47,026 --> 01:09:49,962
No, fuck you, Holly.
I'm sick of your shit.

522
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:52,498
I'm sick of all of your shits, okay?

523
01:09:52,598 --> 01:09:54,734
I just got off the phone with two...

524
01:09:54,834 --> 01:09:58,470
two. Count 'em. Two cam girls.

525
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:03,042
Oh, yeah. They want to come
to Hollywood, and work for me.

526
01:10:03,142 --> 01:10:06,002
So, A.B.C.

527
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:09,782
Always be camming, bitches.

528
01:10:09,882 --> 01:10:13,653
'Cause the next generation's coming,
and they're going to replace you.

529
01:10:13,753 --> 01:10:17,289
Just like you replaced
the whores before you.

530
01:10:17,389 --> 01:10:18,591
Stop saying "whores"!

531
01:10:18,691 --> 01:10:21,492
No! I'll say "whores"
if I want to say "whores"!

532
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:24,195
I'll say "whores" if I want.

533
01:10:24,295 --> 01:10:27,014
Now you got me irritated.

534
01:10:29,701 --> 01:10:33,087
And since it's such a slow night...

535
01:10:33,338 --> 01:10:36,191
why don't I put one of you sluts to work?

536
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:38,693
How does that sound?

537
01:10:38,793 --> 01:10:40,546
So who's it going to be?

538
01:10:40,646 --> 01:10:43,344
One of you girls is going
to show me your pussy.

539
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:48,302
No.

540
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,307
We're not girls, Ian. We're women.

541
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:57,112
I was a girl when I got here, but after
working for you for eight fucking months,

542
01:10:57,262 --> 01:10:59,732
now I'm sad to say, I'm a woman.

543
01:10:59,832 --> 01:11:02,702
I'm the oldest 18-year old woman I know.

544
01:11:02,802 --> 01:11:06,571
All because I made
a big mistake in coming here.

545
01:11:06,671 --> 01:11:10,059
But you know what?
The more I think about it,

546
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:15,114
the more I realize I'm not the only one
that made the mistake, Ian.

547
01:11:15,214 --> 01:11:18,665
You made a big mistake.

548
01:11:19,083 --> 01:11:24,290
Wanna know why? Because you put
three women in a room together.

549
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:28,727
Do you know what three women
in a room together used to be called?

550
01:11:28,827 --> 01:11:31,647
A coven. You got that?

551
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:33,615
Witches.

552
01:11:34,699 --> 01:11:38,270
And the power of witches
is always strongest in threes.

553
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:40,504
You fuck.

554
01:11:42,808 --> 01:11:44,609
Witches, now?

555
01:11:44,709 --> 01:11:46,812
Witches. Okay.

556
01:11:46,912 --> 01:11:53,701
Well, which witch is going
to ride this broomstick?

557
01:11:56,721 --> 01:11:58,706
Yeah.

558
01:11:59,424 --> 01:12:00,759
- This one.
- No.

559
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:03,676
- Yes. Yes!
- No! No!

560
01:12:04,026 --> 01:12:07,281
- I don't wanna!
- Well, you're gonna!

561
01:12:33,324 --> 01:12:35,776
What the fuck?

562
01:12:39,697 --> 01:12:42,655
Oh, you fucking bitch.

563
01:12:43,367 --> 01:12:46,814
The fuck is this shit?

564
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:51,676
What the fuck is this?

565
01:12:51,876 --> 01:12:54,529
What the fuck?

566
01:12:55,129 --> 01:12:57,631
What the fuck?

567
01:13:09,127 --> 01:13:11,745
What the fuck.

568
01:13:12,231 --> 01:13:14,774
What the fuck.

569
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,574
What the fuck.

570
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:31,031
What the fuck?

571
01:13:51,402 --> 01:13:54,122
What the fuck!

572
01:13:59,911 --> 01:14:03,063
Okay! Okay! Okay!

573
01:14:12,757 --> 01:14:15,710
What the fuck do you want?

574
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:19,815
What? What the fuck!

575
01:14:26,237 --> 01:14:29,996
Oh, fuck, okay, okay!

576
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:34,828
Okay!

577
01:14:38,382 --> 01:14:43,270
There! You made your point,
take your fucking pictures!

578
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:53,164
What the fuck?

579
01:14:53,264 --> 01:14:56,919
I don't have a pussy!
I don't have a pussy!

580
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:10,415
Are you fucking bitches
fucked in the head?

581
01:15:10,515 --> 01:15:14,270
What the fuck is wrong with you?
This is fucking insane!

582
01:15:24,929 --> 01:15:28,049
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

583
01:15:28,699 --> 01:15:31,051
Fuck you!

584
01:15:44,149 --> 01:15:46,185
Please don't make me do this. Please.

585
01:15:46,285 --> 01:15:50,837
I'll pay you.
I'll fucking pay you, please!

586
01:15:55,293 --> 01:15:58,080
Oh, fuck, okay, okay!

587
01:16:01,031 --> 01:16:02,951
Okay.

588
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:09,323
What the fuck. What the fuck.

589
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:13,627
This is fucked up. This is fucked!

590
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,972
Fuck you.

591
01:16:41,839 --> 01:16:45,292
Fuck you! Fuck you, bitches!

592
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:56,121
- What the fuck are you crying about?
- Look at all that blood.

593
01:16:56,221 --> 01:17:01,016
This is getting boring. What happens
if we turn this shit up to ten?

594
01:17:03,927 --> 01:17:05,879
That.

595
01:17:11,702 --> 01:17:16,590
Hi. Is Ian here?
He flew me out from Maine to work.

596
01:17:17,575 --> 01:17:19,859
I'm Nancy.

597
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:25,317
Hello, Nancy. Welcome.

598
01:17:25,417 --> 01:17:30,022
You're joining us during a period
of transition for the company.

599
01:17:30,122 --> 01:17:33,674
As of today, we're actually
under new management.

600
01:17:35,077 --> 01:17:36,595
Well, what happened to Ian?

601
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:41,566
Unfortunately, Ian is no longer
with the company, due to...

602
01:17:41,792 --> 01:17:44,110
cutbacks.

603
01:18:01,853 --> 01:18:04,811
<i>Your imagination come to life!</i>

604
01:18:06,925 --> 01:18:11,054
<i>Uvu shows you you!</i>

605
01:18:17,001 --> 01:18:18,537
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

606
01:18:18,637 --> 01:18:21,840
- Your kids are going to love that.
- The kids are definitely going to love it.

607
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:26,245
- Wait 'til you put it on your head.
- Well, I'll leave... I'll leave that to the kids.

608
01:18:26,345 --> 01:18:31,054
- Alright. Hope they enjoy. Merry Christmas.
- Yup, thank you. Merry Christmas.

609
01:18:31,154 --> 01:18:32,362
- Goodnight.
- Hi.

610
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:36,320
- I'm sorry, we're closed.
- No, no, no, I called. About the Uvu.

611
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:39,725
- That guy got the last one.
- What? No. I called.

612
01:18:39,825 --> 01:18:42,754
- I'm Pete Gunderson. I said I was coming.
- First come, first served.

613
01:18:42,854 --> 01:18:45,980
- But you...
- Sorry, pal. Holidays are hell.

614
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:51,686
Fuck.

615
01:18:52,136 --> 01:18:55,017
Yeah, honey. Got the last one.
Okay, I'll be home in 15.

616
01:18:55,117 --> 01:18:58,661
- Excuse me. Excuse me, sir? Hi.
- I love you. Bye.

617
01:18:58,761 --> 01:19:01,880
Look, I'll... I'll give you $300 for it.

618
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:04,116
Yeah, not a chance, pal. Try Ebay.

619
01:19:04,216 --> 01:19:07,322
Wait, wait, wait! Please, please.
I'll... I'll give you...

620
01:19:07,718 --> 01:19:11,423
I'll give you 500. Please,
it's Christmas Eve. I'm out of time.

621
01:19:11,523 --> 01:19:14,559
Listen, if it was really that important,
you would have gotten here earlier.

622
01:19:14,659 --> 01:19:16,861
Merry Christmas.

623
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:20,113
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

624
01:19:36,013 --> 01:19:37,832
Oh, my God.

625
01:19:37,932 --> 01:19:40,516
Oh, my God.

626
01:19:42,286 --> 01:19:45,006
I'll call...

627
01:20:06,193 --> 01:20:07,877
Sorry.

628
01:20:12,183 --> 01:20:15,587
I finally had it,
and I told Ed he was full of shit.

629
01:20:15,687 --> 01:20:18,470
I mean, I deserve that Christmas bonus

630
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:22,294
a hell of a lot more than that do-nothing,
kiss-ass nephew of his.

631
01:20:22,394 --> 01:20:25,429
I swear I could kill him. Scrooge.

632
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,482
What?

633
01:20:27,832 --> 01:20:29,768
Have you not been listening to me?

634
01:20:29,868 --> 01:20:33,371
Ed didn't give me the Christmas bonus
that we were counting on.

635
01:20:33,471 --> 01:20:35,674
And with you making less money now...

636
01:20:35,774 --> 01:20:39,125
God. I'm at the end of my rope.

637
01:20:39,643 --> 01:20:43,997
How much was this thing anyway?
I hope you didn't overspend.

638
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,721
- Stop.
- Come on.

639
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:09,756
No.

640
01:21:22,786 --> 01:21:26,272
I still can't believe you got it, Dad!

641
01:21:26,891 --> 01:21:28,593
So, you just watch stuff on them?

642
01:21:28,693 --> 01:21:33,580
Yeah, it aggregates your online identity
to figure out what to show you.

643
01:21:37,134 --> 01:21:40,922
<i>Congratulations, captain!
You're the first person to walk on Mars.</i>

644
01:21:41,172 --> 01:21:43,806
You've got to try it, Dad.

645
01:21:44,356 --> 01:21:48,623
- Am I going to see what you saw?
- No, it's different for everyone.

646
01:21:51,649 --> 01:21:54,653
<i>Thank you, Daddy. Thank you, Daddy.</i>

647
01:21:54,753 --> 01:21:57,421
It's totally cool, right?

648
01:21:57,521 --> 01:22:01,207
Right. Yeah. Totally.

649
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,678
Is this the off button?

650
01:22:40,531 --> 01:22:43,234
<i>Please don't punish me, Daddy.</i>

651
01:22:43,334 --> 01:22:47,353
<i>I promise I won't be naughty anymore.</i>

652
01:23:02,052 --> 01:23:04,222
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

653
01:23:04,322 --> 01:23:07,053
I'll call... I'll call...

654
01:23:10,094 --> 01:23:12,112
Sorry.

655
01:23:12,996 --> 01:23:15,348
What the fuck?

656
01:23:20,227 --> 01:23:22,721
- <i>Heart attack?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

657
01:23:22,821 --> 01:23:25,544
<i>Probably would have made it too,
if he got help in time.</i>

658
01:23:25,644 --> 01:23:28,313
<i>Hell of a Christmas gift for his family.</i>

659
01:23:28,413 --> 01:23:30,281
<i>Fucking Christmas.</i>

660
01:23:30,381 --> 01:23:32,950
<i>I hear ya, bro.</i>

661
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:36,770
<i>Okay. Bag him up.
We need the fridge space.</i>

662
01:23:38,356 --> 01:23:42,193
Hi! It says on your website that...

663
01:23:42,293 --> 01:23:45,530
Less than one percent of users
may experience an...

664
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:49,401
adverse reaction when using the device?
And I was just... just wondering,

665
01:23:49,501 --> 01:23:55,340
what type of adverse reactions
are users experiencing exactly?

666
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,792
<i>Are you having trouble
with your device, sir?</i>

667
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:02,619
Troub... no...

668
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:06,589
No. I'm not, no... Just wondering.

669
01:24:06,689 --> 01:24:08,582
<i>Well, if you'd like to give me
your name and login,</i>

670
01:24:08,682 --> 01:24:13,074
<i>I can check your video feed to see
if there's anything abnormal going on.</i>

671
01:24:14,171 --> 01:24:16,795
You can do that? That's fine.
I don't need that. That's not necessary.

672
01:24:16,895 --> 01:24:19,278
Thank you very much.

673
01:24:30,507 --> 01:24:31,839
Sara?

674
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:36,281
- Where's Bobby?
- I sent him to stay with a friend.

675
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:40,084
You forgot to log out, Pete.

676
01:24:43,687 --> 01:24:47,659
I don't know what that showed you, but...

677
01:24:47,759 --> 01:24:49,727
Everything.

678
01:24:49,827 --> 01:24:52,378
I saw everything.

679
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:56,150
I just want to know one thing.

680
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:59,118
Why'd you do it?

681
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:06,626
Because he had what I wanted...

682
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:13,499
and I was tired of being nice.

683
01:25:14,451 --> 01:25:16,870
Oh, Pete.

684
01:25:17,354 --> 01:25:20,674
That is the hottest thing
you have ever said.

685
01:26:02,516 --> 01:26:06,036
<i>Hey! Everyone's gone.
I'm going to go ahead and lock up.</i>

686
01:26:12,943 --> 01:26:17,671
<i>And I made this, just the way you like it.</i>

687
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:23,738
<i>Oh, Ed. You don't look so good.</i>

688
01:26:26,357 --> 01:26:29,175
<i>I hope you aren't afraid of the dark, Ed.</i>

689
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,612
<i>Should've given me that bonus, Ed.</i>

690
01:26:46,009 --> 01:26:48,862
This is what happens to scrooges like you.

691
01:26:51,715 --> 01:26:54,367
Ain't the holidays hell?

692
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:13,252
Pete, you awake?

693
01:27:37,695 --> 01:27:40,098
I didn't want to have to do this.

694
01:27:40,198 --> 01:27:43,216
You know, I kept pushing it off.

695
01:27:43,436 --> 01:27:47,789
I didn't want to... ruin another holiday.

696
01:27:49,539 --> 01:27:53,293
I wanted to pretend
like everything was okay.

697
01:27:54,012 --> 01:27:56,013
But you...

698
01:27:56,113 --> 01:27:58,264
you.

699
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:02,835
I mean, I thought that when you...

700
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:06,273
when you got to know me... you know...

701
01:28:06,373 --> 01:28:11,043
when you saw the real me, that you'd...

702
01:28:13,096 --> 01:28:15,581
Never mind.

703
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:18,369
Tonight at midnight,

704
01:28:18,469 --> 01:28:21,673
I want to kiss someone
who makes me feel...

705
01:28:21,773 --> 01:28:25,057
like I can take the tape off their lips.

706
01:28:31,248 --> 01:28:33,699
God damn it.

707
01:28:47,732 --> 01:28:50,805
Sorry about that. Let me try that again.

708
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:57,991
Jesus Christ.

709
01:29:06,316 --> 01:29:09,129
Mandy. Mandy.

710
01:29:09,229 --> 01:29:11,030
Hey.

711
01:29:45,172 --> 01:29:48,090
Can't be worse than the last one.

712
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,169
How is it?

713
01:29:58,269 --> 01:30:01,171
They're great.
They're the best chicken fingers.

714
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:04,156
They bread them with frosted flakes.

715
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:06,878
My mom didn't let me eat sugary cereal.

716
01:30:06,978 --> 01:30:09,514
You know, rots your teeth.

717
01:30:09,614 --> 01:30:11,682
My teeth aren't rotten.

718
01:30:11,782 --> 01:30:15,087
You must brush a lot. Do you brush a lot?

719
01:30:15,187 --> 01:30:18,305
I don't know. I guess so.

720
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:20,345
Let me see 'em.

721
01:30:20,445 --> 01:30:23,710
- What?
- Let me see those pearly whites.

722
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:28,866
I bet they sparkle.
Let me see those choppers, come on.

723
01:30:29,366 --> 01:30:32,651
Yeah. I knew it.

724
01:30:32,936 --> 01:30:35,388
You have great teeth.

725
01:30:40,544 --> 01:30:43,781
That was... that was... I'm sorry.

726
01:30:43,881 --> 01:30:48,252
I'm sorry.
That was... it's just the nerves.

727
01:30:48,352 --> 01:30:50,354
That's the problem
with these first dates, you know.

728
01:30:50,454 --> 01:30:53,291
If people got to know the real me,
you know, they would love me.

729
01:30:53,391 --> 01:30:57,471
But, you know, they never get to meet me.
You know, because it's just...

730
01:30:57,571 --> 01:31:01,797
Because the nerve monster
just rears its ugly head.

731
01:31:03,633 --> 01:31:07,938
Most guys I date online just want
to hook up. One and done.

732
01:31:08,038 --> 01:31:11,445
They act like I'm crazy for wanting
something more lasting.

733
01:31:11,545 --> 01:31:13,571
Right?

734
01:31:14,015 --> 01:31:19,600
You know, people say that those dating
websites are bullshit but I mean, 96%?

735
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:22,286
I mean, like,
that's an all-time high for me.

736
01:31:22,386 --> 01:31:24,555
My last girlfriend was like
an 84% and, you know,

737
01:31:24,655 --> 01:31:28,308
yeah, no surprise that didn't...
that didn't turn out.

738
01:31:29,158 --> 01:31:33,312
- What happened?
- She... I had to...

739
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:36,715
I had to end it.

740
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:40,252
It was for the best.

741
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:49,262
Sorry. You are so much hotter
than she was.

742
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,083
I mean...

743
01:31:53,183 --> 01:31:54,585
prettier.

744
01:31:54,685 --> 01:31:57,170
Should we get the check?

745
01:32:18,942 --> 01:32:20,711
I'm sorry.

746
01:32:20,811 --> 01:32:24,014
- For what?
- For calling you hot.

747
01:32:24,114 --> 01:32:27,518
- Why would you apologize for that?
- Because it made me sound all pervy.

748
01:32:27,618 --> 01:32:30,921
Like I was trying to hook up with you.

749
01:32:31,021 --> 01:32:34,981
You know. And I know
you don't like that on a first date.

750
01:32:37,827 --> 01:32:41,032
It's New Year's Eve. I'd have to be
the most unromantic gal in the world

751
01:32:41,132 --> 01:32:45,105
to want to go home to a lonely apartment.

752
01:32:47,336 --> 01:32:49,222
Yup.

753
01:32:52,009 --> 01:32:55,347
Do you want to go back to my place
and watch the ball drop?

754
01:33:11,361 --> 01:33:14,313
- Can I take your jacket?
- Yeah.

755
01:33:26,944 --> 01:33:30,264
- Should I not?
- No. I need to use the restroom.

756
01:33:30,414 --> 01:33:32,450
You know, I just... I want to freshen up.

757
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:37,102
Okay. Great idea.
Down the hall to the right.

758
01:34:55,085 --> 01:34:57,149
No, no, no, no, no.

759
01:36:00,330 --> 01:36:02,530
<i>Ten!</i>

760
01:36:04,902 --> 01:36:07,120
<i>Nine!</i>

761
01:36:08,806 --> 01:36:10,823
<i>Eight!</i>

762
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:14,500
<i>Seven!</i>

763
01:36:15,645 --> 01:36:17,530
<i>Six!</i>

764
01:36:18,715 --> 01:36:20,493
<i>Five!</i>

765
01:36:21,668 --> 01:36:23,370
<i>Four!</i>

766
01:36:24,422 --> 01:36:26,169
<i>Three!</i>

767
01:36:27,390 --> 01:36:29,475
<i>Two!</i>

768
01:36:31,730 --> 01:36:32,973
<i>One!</i>

769
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:43,235
<i>Feliz año nuevo, cariño.</i>
