00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:37,750
So the Belington House
is a wonderful place.

191
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,720
They have a wide variety of
special therapeutic programs

192
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,189
designed for girls
just like you

193
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,024
and it's a lot more fun
than a hospital.

194
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,495
Excuse me, I'm sorry to
interrupt, but I gotta say

195
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,430
locking her up again
doesn't really sound like

196
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,464
the right strategy here.

197
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:52,665
With all due respect,
sheriff

198
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,701
I think we can trust
Dr. Rooney's expertise.

199
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,869
We haven't even received
the DNA results yet.

200
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,147
It seems a little bit
premature...

201
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,673
I was just explaining to our
patient, the Belington House...

202
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,309
I'm gonna go with her!

203
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,612
Well, uh..

204
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,415
We'll see about that.

205
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:11,050
[engine revving]

206
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,385
So you're gonna be with me

207
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,554
until your DNA results
come in.

208
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,325
DNA is something
that we use to identify

209
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,360
any relatives
that you might have.

210
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,763
[indistinct chatter]

211
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,501
Until then I'm gonna
be responsible for you.

212
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,904
You okay with that?

213
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,645
You don't like my driving?

214
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,382
We're going less than
20 miles an hour.

215
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,415
It's safe.

216
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,618
I mean,
not in, in general.

217
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:46,919
If, you know,
for example

218
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,155
if you're driving
under the influence,

219
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,057
but... I don't drink

220
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,992
so no need to worry
about that.

221
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,562
You don't drink?

222
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,029
Not anymore.

223
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,999
You must be very thirsty.

224
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,768
[laughs]

225
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:11,744
[instrumental music]

226
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,556
Not many vegetarians
in this town.

227
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,960
[indistinct laughter]

228
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,431
[indistinct chatter]

229
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,799
[horn honking]

230
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:33,832
Little shit.

231
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,602
What are you thinking?

232
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,904
Come on, let's go.

233
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,939
You wanna stay away
from guys like that.

234
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,374
[indistinct radio chatter]

235
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,129
[door opens]

236
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,501
You hungry?

237
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,172
I'm not a great cook,

238
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,575
but I know
what goes with ketchup.

239
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,749
[chuckles]

240
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,688
Pretty good, huh?

241
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,565
Who's this?

242
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:39,999
Anna, this is Ray.

243
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,734
Ray, this is Anna

244
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:44,604
the girl that I was telling
you about from the hospital.

245
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,539
Why is she wearing
my clothes?

246
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:48,074
Because she's our guest

247
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:50,410
and because she needed
something to wear.

248
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:53,112
You never wear that shirt
anyway, so why do you care.

249
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,814
What happened
to your head?

250
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:55,958
It's none of your
fuckin' business.

251
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,551
Excuse me,
language, young man.

252
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,456
Are you his daddy?

253
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,191
[chuckles]

254
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:08,561
No, I'm not his daddy.
I'm his sister.

255
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:11,230
Only men can be daddies
and women are moms.

256
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,800
Everyone has them.

257
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,435
Whether you like it
or not.

258
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,706
[eerie sounds]

259
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:22,274
I'm sorry it smells
a bit musty in here

260
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,544
because we don't use
this room very often.

261
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,313
Okay, here you go.

262
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:35,087
[instrumental music]

263
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:37,524
Well if you, uh,
you need anything

264
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,692
I'm, I'm just across
the hall, okay?

265
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,661
Okay?

266
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,532
Can we close it?

267
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,099
Are you cold?

268
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,539
The Wildling.

269
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,774
What's a Wildling?

270
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:58,878
He eats children.

271
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:03,750
Oh. Did your daddy
tell you that?

272
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,121
Have you ever seen him,
a Wildling?

273
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,658
In my dreams.

274
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,796
Listen, Anna

275
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,298
I've been
to a lot of places

276
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,668
and I've never seen
a Wildling before.

277
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,772
It's okay,
you're safe here.

278
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,177
You get some rest.
You've had a long day.

279
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,684
Goodnight.

280
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,389
[creature growling]

281
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,424

[creature growling]
[girl groaning]

284
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:28,667
Hey.

285
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,402
Good morning.

286
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,440
You okay in there?

287
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,475
It's 7:00,
time for breakfast.

288
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,412
[water running]

289
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:49,955
Whoa!

[music continues]

293
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,347
We only moved here
for Ellen's job.

294
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,316
Right after
our parents died.

295
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,450
If we were
still in the city

296
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,352
we'd be taking the subway.

297
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,622
No, subway sucks.

298
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:58,958
No cell phone signal
anywhere, ever. Sucks.

299
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:00,860
Only one
single chain restaurant

300
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,429
and that's Dairy Queen.
Sucks.

301
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,268
I told you.

302
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,003
They're not hamsters.

303
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:12,571
A... and they're not
babies either.

304
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,807
No.

305
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,108
[chuckles]

306
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,296
Do you wanna see where
you really came from?

307
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,184
Well this should give you
the general idea.

308
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:29,055
[woman moaning]

309

[light growling]

312
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,275
Got a little something
for you.

313
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,090
You know that's what
you use

314
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:13,092
when you're bleeding
down there.

315
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,426
So it's medicine?

316
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,929
No. No, no,
you're not sick.

317
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,265
You're a woman.

318
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:29,108
[audience cheering]

319
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,749

Wooh, go Lady Grizzlies!

321
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,624
Do you know
where the library is?

322
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,527
- Yeah, I'll show you.
- Get all those girls back to the start.

323
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,163
The party
is this Saturday.

324
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:52,731
It's at my house.

325
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,968
So you should
definitely come

326
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:57,937
'cause you'll get
to meet everyone.

327
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,638
- Gonna be super fun.
- Thank you.

328
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:00,706
Bye.

329
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,674
Bye.

Oh, God, really?

333
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,178
Yeah, I mean probably.

334
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:42,581
She's barefoot.

335
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,516
[girls laughing]

336
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,628
You think she's the girl who was
kept in her father's attic?

337
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,955
Oh, my God, really,
like a sex slave?

338
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:49,988
Yeah.

339
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,826
She must be retarded.

340
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:06,205
Uh, hi.
Excuse me, miss. Hi.

341
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:07,706
You lookin' for something?

342
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,242
I'm... I'm looking
for Ray.

343
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:11,987
He was supposed to meet me at
the library after school...

344
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,488
You know you should
really be more careful

345
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:15,814
there's like broken glass
and shit.

346
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:18,684
[coughs]

347
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:20,219
We might be
able to help you out.

[knock on door]

349
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,199
Come on,
let me out!

350
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:34,232
Whatcha think?

351
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,833
Sure.

352
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:40,772
You guys are so hilarious.

353
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,608
Ray, you never told us
you had a girlfriend.

354
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:45,912
- I don't.
- Well, then what are you, fuck-buddies?

355
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:47,779
- Leave her out of this.
- Hey, buddy.

356
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:49,015
You forgot something.

357
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,516
[grunting]

358
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,318
Who's smokin' pot?

359
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,420
- No one.
- Oh, good boy.

360
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,587
That's a good boy.

361
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:57,856
- Make sure he remembers that.
- Mm-hmm

362
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,391
[grunting]

363
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:06,032
Hey,
that was very impressive.

364
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:07,266
What's your name?

365
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,970
You're not doing me
any favors.

366
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,372

your kind in 16 years

554
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:22,012
since the last purge.

555
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:27,918
Yeah, I remember
that night.

556
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:29,720
I'll never forget it.

557
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:37,061
Men from the town said they
got every last one of them.

558
00:51:41,366 --> 00:51:43,868
But that isn't
quite true, is it?

559
00:51:56,981 --> 00:51:59,550
Do you wanna know
where your mother is?

Gabe, you okay?

564
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,416
I'm fine!

[baby crying]

566
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:24,335
Any more of them
bastards back there?

567
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:27,338
No, we got 'em all.

568
00:53:30,308 --> 00:53:33,511
Every last one of them.

[baby cooing]

570
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:49,193

What's going on?

577
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:10,975
We found Lawrence..

578
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,144
...and her dress
by his body.

I'm sorry, Anna.

582
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,474
I really
wanna understand.

583
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:49,814
I'll be back.

[sniffing]

593
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:41,025
Before I got you,
I had a dog.

594
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:45,730
His name was Jasper.
Good dog.

595
00:57:45,763 --> 00:57:47,965
Always a bit of a rebel.

596
00:57:50,568 --> 00:57:54,371
But then after the night
I got you

597
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:58,242
Jasper got crazier
and crazier.

598
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:03,213
And then finally
one day he snapped.

599
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:08,653
So I had to send him
to the better place..

600
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,756
...you know.

601
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:19,196
I swore an oath, Anna.

602
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:23,467
That I would kill
the Wildlings.

603
00:58:25,636 --> 00:58:27,037
If I had been..

604
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:30,841
...half the true hunter
Jasper was

605
00:58:31,976 --> 00:58:34,912
there would be no Anna..

606
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:37,715
...and Jasper would still
be at my side.

607
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,892
There's a better place
for you.

608
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:00,504
Lift up your shirt.

609
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:09,179
Find the place..

610
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,150
...and put it in.

611
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,290
Now, push it in.
Push it all the way in.

612
00:59:20,324 --> 00:59:23,861
Daddy, why didn't
you tell me

613
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,830
that I'm a Wildling?

614
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:32,369
I wanted to spare you.

615
00:59:34,038 --> 00:59:35,472
Why?

616
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,907
(needle drops)

617
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,177
Why did you spare me?

618
00:59:47,852 --> 00:59:50,287
Anna was a mistake..

619
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:57,594
...and so is daddy.

620
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:03,734

Good morning, Anna.

626
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:55,753
You okay under there?

627
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:59,456
Come on get up, I need to
take you to the district..

Ah! No! No! Anna!

- Anna?
- Drive!

631
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:17,074
- Anna, seriously...
- Can you go a bit quicker, please?

632
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:18,943
Where are we even going?

633
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:21,445
- To the Northern Light.
- Seriously?

634
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:23,280
This is crazy.
I mean, you're a fugitive.

635
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,582
No, I'm a Wildling.

636
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:29,519
Why are you slowing down?

637
01:01:29,553 --> 01:01:31,655
Why are we stopping?

638
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,023
What is it, a Wildling?

639
01:01:33,057 --> 01:01:35,425
- Keep driving!
- What is a Wildling, Anna?

640
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:37,561
I wanna help you,
but you can't honestly

641
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:39,830
think that we can just
steal a cop car like this.

642
01:01:39,864 --> 01:01:41,766
They can trace
this thing!

You're gonna get sick
in those wet clothes.

Hey, come on, Anna.

Get the men.

664
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:49,479
I can't do that, Gabe.

665
01:05:49,513 --> 01:05:52,116
Not if she's with the kid.

666
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:54,051
I ran into Cooper
this mornin'.

667

I tell ya she's asking
too many questions.

I'm not going to jail
for this, Gabe.

Not for your mist..

670

You let her get away!

If we follow the river, it's probably
gonna take us back to the lake.

692
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:26,970
From there, we can find
our way back to the car

693
