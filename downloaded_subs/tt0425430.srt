1
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,114
It's okay. Mommy's here, okay?

2
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,317
I need you to be a big boy, okay?

3
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:42,533
Get under the bed. Get under the bed.
Right now. Quick. Quick.

4
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,664
Please, leave us alone!

5
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,755
Where's Mom? Where's...

6
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,489
Go, Michael, go!

7
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,359
No!

8
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,743
Michael.

9
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,610
Michael, run!

10
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,269
You're going to run down the battery.

11
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,580
Like you could get
a signal around here anyway.

12
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:28,245
Luckily, people out here remember you can
have conversations without those things.

13
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,848
It's okay, buddy.

14
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,689
Be careful not to unbuckle his seatbelt.

15
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,056
I'm not.

16
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,162
We're here. How about that?

17
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,504
No going back now.

18
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,709
We couldn't afford it even if we wanted to.

19
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,581
I know it's a bit run-down,
but wait till you see the inside.

20
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,720
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Denise, check out the water pump.

21
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,519
You want to come see your new back yard?

22
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,050
Yeah? It's big.

23
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,757
- Still works.
- Yeah, I'm impressed.

24
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,658
I know you're worried.

25
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:02,538
But a couple of days and I'll have everything
here running like new. I promise.

26
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,473
Even that?

27
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,082
All right. Maybe a week.

28
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,311
Still think we can do this?

29
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,122
Climate's right. The soil reports are great.

30
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,790
Listen, I know I couldn't make this work
in the city.

31
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,658
But this is something I know.

32
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,220
Jess.

33
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,319
Jess, come help with these bags.

34
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,065
What do you think of the house?

35
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,663
Neat.

36
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,271
Help us unload.

37
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,273
If we want anything to sleep on tonight,
we got to get moving.

38
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,435
Okay.

39
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,239
Neat.

40
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,913
I think she's going to be okay.

41
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,987
Well, at least she's talking to us.
I guess that's a start.

42
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,820
Yeah.

43
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,964
I love it out here, you know.

44
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,447
- Hey.
- Hey.

45
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,073
How's it going?

46
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,621
It's so quiet out here.

47
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,157
Yeah. It takes some getting used to, huh?

48
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:57,237
You know, bringing you out here
wasn't a punishment, Jessica.

49
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,709
It's an adjustment for everybody.

50
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,307
And the only way
we're going to make this work

51
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,476
is if we give it a chance.

52
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,049
"I'll take that as a good point, Dad.

53
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,650
"You're right. You're always right."

54
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,435
Good night.

55
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,765
Get some sleep.

56
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,921
Don't give up, honey!

57
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,186
Don't worry. I'll get it.

58
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:53,859
Come on.

59
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,028
Come on.

60
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,762
Come on.

61
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,362
Come on. That's right. Come on.

62
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,800
He did it! High-five. High-five.

63
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,508
He did it!

64
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,717
Roy Solomon?

65
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,749
Colby Price. Belton Savings.

66
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,348
Oh, hey. Good to meet you.

67
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,727
So you said
your father grew sunflowers, too.

68
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,890
Yeah, over in Turek County.

69
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,299
I grew up not too far from here.

70
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,530
Right.

71
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,132
Look, I know you're all moved in,

72
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:13,702
but an opportunity came up at the bank
that I thought you might be interested in.

73
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,771
This place sat gathering dust for years
until you came along and bought it,

74
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,317
and now, as it happens,

75
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,718
another party's expressed interest
in the farm.

76
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,415
The good news is,
they're willing to pay what you paid

77
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,323
and put another 15% on top of that.

78
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,531
We just got here.

79
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,930
And frankly,

80
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:39,035
my family's looking for a little stability
right now.

81
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,102
Well, this will give you the details.

82
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,739
Give me a call if you want to discuss it.

83
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,413
Thanks, I will.

84
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,856
Hey, Benny.

85
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,288
I'm coming.

86
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:15,937
You ready?

87
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,813
Oh, great.

88
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,360
Ben?

89
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,210
Ben?

90
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,859
Hey, sport.

91
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,959
I thought you were asleep.

92
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,069
How'd you get out of bed, sport?

93
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,599
I thought you were...

94
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,782
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

95
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,410
Okay.

96
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,957
All right, Ben.
Now you try to get some sleep now, okay?

97
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,292
Lay down. Go to sleep. Good boy.

98
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,591
Daddy loves you.

99
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,650
What?

100
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,677
What are you doing?

101
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,715
- Going to town.
- I don't think so, Jess.

102
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,248
Give me the keys.

103
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,654
I just had them, like, two seconds ago.

104
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,857
Thanks, Jess. You ready to go?

105
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,922
Jess?

106
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,930
What's up with that?

107
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,070
It was me, not her.

108
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,538
I thought she was taking the car.

109
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,540
Don't beat yourself up over it.

110
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:45,374
By the way, your son managed to climb
out of his crib last night.

111
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,815
That's new.

112
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,611
Yeah.

113
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,752
So are the things I'm gonna do to you

114
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,855
when I come in from the fields tonight.

115
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,561
- New things, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

116
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,023
I've been reading the farmer-sutra.

117
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,367
See you.

118
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:30,793
- There you go. You have a good day now.
- Thanks, Ed.

119
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,853
Well, you're the new folks in town, right?

120
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,796
Yeah, Roy Solomon.

121
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,266
- So what do you plant?
- Sunflowers.

122
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,032
All right. Let me help you get started.

123
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,638
Hey, mind if I go look around?

124
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,742
Okay.

125
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,340
Hey, don't go too far.

126
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,629
Hey, buddy.

127
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,162
Hey, what're you looking at?

128
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,939
You didn't get to finish your cereal.

129
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:05,247
And Daddy said you got out of the crib
last night all by yourself.

130
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,083
Did you do that all by yourself?

131
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,490
Nice!

132
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,355
Pass it up.

133
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:17,784
Got it.

134
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,885
You're all over him.

135
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,855
- Get up! Get up!
- Take it!

136
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,367
- Come on, Bobby. What was that?
- Come on.

137
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,236
Little help?

138
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,134
Thanks.

139
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,839
- It's all in the wrists.
- Right.

140
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,384
I'm Bobby.

141
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,680
Jess.

142
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,416
Welcome to North Dakota, Jess.
You're from Chicago, right?

143
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,753
Yeah. How'd you know that?

144
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:53,965
Small town. Everybody knows everything.
You might want to remember that.

145
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,335
So what do you guys do for fun out here?

146
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,568
You're looking at it.

147
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,068
Sweet.

148
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,968
Half now and half at harvest.
That's the best I can do.

149
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,183
I appreciate it.

150
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:18,814
And if you're looking for labor,
it's gotten cheap with all the unemployment.

151
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:24,426
I can't afford much now,
but I'll keep it in mind. Thanks, Ed.

152
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,366
You're kicking my ass.

153
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,565
Yeah, it's all in the wrists.

154
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,470
Come on, you played in Chicago, right?

155
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,338
Well, I used to. I played in junior high.

156
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,843
Yeah? What happened?

157
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:45,178
I don't know.
I guess I just got into other things.

158
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,782
Well, the girls' team here is for shit.

159
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,258
Yeah, boys' is too, if you're on it.

160
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,831
Nice one, bro.

161
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:15,374
Hey, you know, if you ever get bored
of doing nothing out at the farm,

162
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:21,248
I could always swing by and pick you up,

163
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:25,619
and we could go do nothing
someplace else.

164
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,383
Yeah, maybe.

165
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,460
Hey, I got to go.

166
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,203
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

167
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,869
Nice to meet you.

168
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,316
Hey, who was that kid?

169
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,275
Just some guy.

170
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,849
From around here?

171
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,685
No. He commutes to shoot hoops.

172
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,219
You get his number?

173
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,355
Dad.

174
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,728
If you want to go back,
if you're too embarrassed,

175
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,233
- I'll get his number for you.
- Dad.

176
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:22,673
You know, I think you and your mom would
have a lot to talk about if you give it a try.

177
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,186
We're all in this together, Jess.

178
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,266
So I'll go see if Mom needs anything.

179
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,572
Okay. Sure.

180
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,814
How was town?

181
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,044
Small.

182
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:06,222
Hey, Jess, I'm really sorry about earlier.

183
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,458
It's okay.

184
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:15,128
Need me to help you with anything?

185
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,101
I'd love it if you could carry down
some of those boxes in the hallway.

186
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,364
Sure. Where do you want them?

187
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,400
Just put them in the cellar.

188
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,239
Thanks.

189
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,079
Oh, God. You got to stop that.

190
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,284
Sorry if I surprised you.

191
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,849
What do you want?

192
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,361
I wondered if you'd had a chance to look
at that purchase offer yet.

193
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,024
We're gonna make a go of it.

194
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,589
We're staying.

195
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:53,460
Now, if you don't mind, I've got work to do.

196
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,170
Of course.

197
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,802
Always lots of work to do around a farm.

198
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,107
Bye now.

199
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,281
Damn it!

200
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,617
Get out of here!

201
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:26,555
Shit.

202
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,352
Oh, my God.

203
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,583
About the only thing that keeps them away.

204
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,483
They always like that?

205
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,147
No. Hell, they just want your seeds.

206
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,883
- Roy Solomon.
- John Burwell.

207
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:11,087
Good to meet you.
Lucky you came by when you did.

208
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:14,290
- You live around here?
- No, I was just heading into town.

209
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,265
Got to go where the work is.

210
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,063
What do you do?

211
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,832
A little bit of everything. Why, you...

212
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,368
You need some help around here?

213
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,435
What was that noise? What's going on?

214
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,913
Everything's all right.

215
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:34,418
This is John Burwell,
part-time crow exterminator.

216
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,579
The crows were going nuts out here.
If John hadn't come along when he did,

217
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,623
I might have gotten pecked to death.

218
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,750
Well, it's a good thing he did then.

219
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:46,763
I could sure use somebody to help me in the
fields, but I really can't pay you till harvest.

220
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:51,268
We could provide meals and put you up
in the workers' quarters till then.

221
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,935
Sunflowers, huh?

222
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,364
All you can eat.

223
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,003
That sounds good to me.

224
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,277
Well, I was making some lunch.
Would you like to join us?

225
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,680
- Sure. Sounds good.
- Okay.

226
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,319
Do you mind keeping that outside?

227
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,858
Sorry.

228
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,629
Got any family out here, John?

229
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,233
No, ma'am. Just me.

230
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,204
Think it's going to be a good harvest?

231
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,943
Well, it's been a while since
that land's been planted, so, yeah.

232
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,581
That's what I like to hear.

233
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,848
Cheers.

234
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,619
Hey, Jess.
Do you mind helping me with these?

235
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,787
Yeah.

236
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,358
Thanks.

237
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,460
You want this?

238
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,065
He won't stop.

239
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,373
But it must mean he likes you.

240
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,975
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

241
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,933
What are you looking for?

242
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,229
Nothing.

243
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:06,895
Roy?

244
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,372
What's wrong?

245
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,866
Oh, my God!

246
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,535
Are you okay?

247
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,806
- What happened?
- It's no big deal.

248
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,075
I cut my hand on the tractor.

249
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,581
Oh, honey, you're gonna need stitches.

250
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,050
No, I just need a bandage.

251
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,610
No, we got to get you to the hospital.

252
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,485
Well, I can take him.

253
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,886
Not with a suspended license, you can't.

254
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,518
All right. I'm going to get Ben's bag.
Jess, you get in the car.

255
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,723
Ben can stay here with Jess.

256
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,629
Roy, I don't think it's a good idea.

257
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:39,261
Just grab the keys and let's go.
Jess and Ben will be fine.

258
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,170
John's right outside if they need anything.

259
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,654
Holy shit.

260
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,695
Your dad gonna be all right?

261
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,358
Yeah. He probably just needs some stitches.

262
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:14,200
Hey, what you got there? Farmer?

263
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,907
You gonna be a farmer when you grow up,
like your daddy, huh?

264
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:22,104
- Let me know if you need anything, okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

265
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,175
What's up with the crows?

266
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,293
All right, Ben. Tonight we have

267
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,234
filet mignon, veal parmesan,

268
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:50,172
baked Alaska, chicken cacciatore,

269
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,436
and mac and cheese.

270
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,717
Stay here, Ben, okay?

271
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,619
Hey.

272
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,489
John.

273
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,367
Is that you?

274
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,671
Hey, who is...

275
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,778
911. What's your emergency?

276
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,909
I think there's something in my house!

277
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,954
I need you to get everybody
out of the house as quickly as possible.

278
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:14,321
We'll send a car immediately.
Ma'am, are you alone?

279
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,984
No, I'm with... I'm with...

280
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,118
Ben!

281
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:30,431
Ben!

282
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,449
Ben?

283
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,236
Ben, what are you...

284
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,165
Ben!

285
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,323
Let me go!

286
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,805
What's wrong?

287
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:48,208
Help us! Take him. Take him.

288
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,912
What's the matter?

289
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,251
What is it? Jess. What's the matter?

290
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,566
Oh, Roy, I hope they're okay.

291
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:19,273
- What happened?
- Everything's all right, ma'am.

292
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,318
Oh, God.

293
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,927
I already checked all the rooms.
There's nobody here.

294
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,225
But she described a lot of damage.

295
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:39,299
As of now, we're going to classify this
as a false alarm, not a deliberate hoax.

296
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,771
Thank you.

297
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,035
What did John say?

298
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,947
Well, he said it was easy to understand
someone getting scared

299
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,417
their first night alone out here.

300
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,221
But that he didn't see anything unusual
in the house.

301
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:04,819
Mom, please believe me.
I'm not making this up. I'm telling the truth.

302
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,362
Jess, please.

303
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,296
Just stop.

304
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:15,630
Dad...

305
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,076
Dad, I'm really scared.
Can we just go home?

306
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:25,279
Jessica, this is home.

307
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,612
You need to get used to that.

308
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,086
But I thought we agreed that
you were going to try.

309
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,093
What happened to that?

310
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,723
Hi. Shut the door.

311
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,163
Maybe we shouldn't have
left Ben alone with her.

312
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:26,934
Did you see her face?
She seemed so scared.

313
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:32,542
I'm really worried about her.

314
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,915
She's just having a hard time adjusting,
that's all.

315
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,948
Being out here will be great for her.

316
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,192
I don't know.

317
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:48,295
- Maybe we're in over our heads here, Roy.
- We'll get through this.

318
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,765
Just give her some time. She'll be fine.

319
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,704
You saw it too, didn't you?

320
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,480
Come on. I know you did. You had to have.

321
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,513
Just tell me.

322
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:19,094
I wish you could just tell them
what you saw.

323
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,528
Come on, Ben.
When are you going to start talking?

324
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,169
I promise I'll never let anything
happen to you.

325
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,144
I promise.

326
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,205
You heard that, too, didn't you?

327
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,235
Can you see them?

328
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,817
Where are they, Ben?

329
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,347
Son of a bitch!

330
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,457
Hey, you didn't hear that.

331
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,263
- Dad said you needed this.
- Yeah, thanks.

332
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:32,072
Why did you tell my parents
you didn't see anything last night?

333
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,643
Well, because I didn't.

334
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,776
I mean, look, I know you were scared.

335
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:46,146
And I know that people,
even your parents, sometimes,

336
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:49,386
- they don't know how to listen.
- Especially my parents.

337
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:53,862
They got pressures
that you can't even begin to understand.

338
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,664
You sure you saw something up there?

339
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,934
I saw it. It was real.

340
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:08,105
Maybe you've just got a lot on your mind.

341
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,989
Hey, Jess.

342
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,290
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

343
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,898
You don't look so good. What's up?

344
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:34,493
Did you know the family
that used to live in my house?

345
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,971
Not really. It was the Rollins that lived there.

346
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,234
What happened to them?

347
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,641
They just up and left
about five, six years ago.

348
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:45,409
There were some bad harvests.
Lot of people didn't make it.

349
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,811
Hey...

350
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:55,551
Did you ever hear of anything
about my house being, like, haunted?

351
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,428
Seriously.

352
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:05,092
Just, like, stupid stories.
It's been abandoned for a long time. So...

353
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,796
- What kind of stories?
- Nothing really.

354
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:13,501
When we were kids, we used to dare
each other to go down into the cellar.

355
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,909
Why? Did you ever see anything?

356
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,713
No. Not me.

357
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,920
I never went down there.

358
00:53:28,544 --> 00:53:30,171
What's happening to me?

359
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:55,337
Are you okay?

360
00:53:57,773 --> 00:53:59,900
I saw something again today.

361
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:05,169
It's a girl. She was in the cellar.
Something...

362
00:54:07,016 --> 00:54:09,211
Something happened to her.

363
00:54:12,622 --> 00:54:15,455
She was trying to get away from something.

364
00:54:16,092 --> 00:54:18,526
- Get away from what?
- I don't know.

365
00:54:19,195 --> 00:54:20,822
But she was...

366
00:54:20,897 --> 00:54:24,230
She looked just scared to death.

367
00:54:31,407 --> 00:54:33,272
Have you told your folks about this?

368
00:54:33,342 --> 00:54:35,776
You know my parents already think I'm nuts.

369
00:54:38,915 --> 00:54:40,883
Do you think it's crazy?

370
00:54:42,552 --> 00:54:44,213
People's spirits

371
00:54:45,388 --> 00:54:47,879
hanging around after they're dead?

372
00:54:49,926 --> 00:54:51,188
No.

373
00:54:52,295 --> 00:54:55,958
There's something about the land out here.

374
00:54:56,032 --> 00:54:59,798
It gets ahold of people.
It doesn't want to let them go.

375
00:55:08,077 --> 00:55:11,069
What about you?
Don't you get lonely out here?

376
00:55:12,214 --> 00:55:14,808
Don't you miss having a family of your own?

377
00:55:14,884 --> 00:55:17,580
Nah, you guys keep me plenty busy.

378
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:28,789
Thank you. For listening.

379
00:55:31,133 --> 00:55:32,361
Anytime.

380
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:53,418
- Almost ready.
- Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

381
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,819
I really like being here, Roy.

382
00:55:59,895 --> 00:56:03,092
You guys make me feel like family.
I'm grateful.

383
00:56:03,165 --> 00:56:05,133
Lucky to have you, John.

384
00:56:05,868 --> 00:56:10,202
Let's see how good the harvest is,
and maybe I can afford to keep you on.

385
00:56:10,272 --> 00:56:13,799
Don't worry about me.
You just take care of your family.

386
00:57:41,997 --> 00:57:43,692
Help me.

387
00:58:06,322 --> 00:58:07,482
Hello?

388
00:58:19,535 --> 00:58:21,526
What do you want from me?

389
00:59:16,158 --> 00:59:17,216
Hey.

390
00:59:22,965 --> 00:59:24,227
You okay?

391
00:59:29,972 --> 00:59:31,564
Can you hear me?

392
00:59:42,585 --> 00:59:44,052
What's wrong?

393
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,648
Is she okay?

394
01:00:19,722 --> 01:00:22,486
The lacerations are superficial.
So she'll be just fine.

395
01:00:22,558 --> 01:00:24,150
Oh, thank God.

396
01:00:25,094 --> 01:00:26,721
Is there any reason...

397
01:00:26,795 --> 01:00:29,856
Has there been any trouble
in the family recently

398
01:00:29,932 --> 01:00:33,766
that would make her want to hurt
or draw attention to herself?

399
01:00:40,075 --> 01:00:42,407
We just moved here from Chicago.

400
01:00:43,279 --> 01:00:45,804
And back there,

401
01:00:45,881 --> 01:00:49,578
Jess got into some trouble.

402
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,950
She's kind of struggled a bit.

403
01:00:54,323 --> 01:00:58,521
We've been dealing with
a lot of emotional issues.

404
01:01:12,141 --> 01:01:14,132
Jessica? Your mom's here.

405
01:01:15,411 --> 01:01:16,469
Hey.

406
01:01:28,824 --> 01:01:31,452
Dad, we need to leave the house now,

407
01:01:31,527 --> 01:01:33,722
before anything else happens.

408
01:01:35,764 --> 01:01:36,822
Dad.

409
01:01:38,634 --> 01:01:40,192
Dad, I'm really scared.

410
01:01:40,269 --> 01:01:44,000
Have you forgotten how hard it was
the last couple of years?

411
01:01:44,673 --> 01:01:47,506
Me out of work, Ben's hospital bills.

412
01:01:47,576 --> 01:01:50,568
We went through every dime
your mother and I managed to save.

413
01:01:50,646 --> 01:01:55,140
Twenty years.
Twenty years of savings gone in two years.

414
01:01:57,286 --> 01:02:01,017
We have everything
riding on this harvest, Jess. Everything.

415
01:02:02,658 --> 01:02:05,388
We're only a couple of days away. Please.

416
01:02:09,598 --> 01:02:12,294
- Mom, these things attacked me.
- Enough!

417
01:02:20,976 --> 01:02:25,242
God. The doctor said
your cuts look self-inflicted.

418
01:02:25,314 --> 01:02:28,010
That's what he said. That you did this!

419
01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:33,554
You actually think that I would do this
to myself?

420
01:02:36,692 --> 01:02:38,683
Why won't you believe me?

421
01:02:39,428 --> 01:02:41,055
How can we, Jess?

422
01:02:43,899 --> 01:02:45,127
Tell me!

423
01:02:46,902 --> 01:02:49,598
I mean,
we thought you put this all behind you.

424
01:02:58,514 --> 01:03:01,244
Why do you keep
blaming everything on me?

425
01:03:02,151 --> 01:03:04,051
You never listen to me.

426
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:09,416
And what? We're supposed to pretend like
we're some big happy family again?

427
01:03:09,858 --> 01:03:11,450
I can't do that.

428
01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:15,421
Jess!

429
01:03:18,867 --> 01:03:20,232
Let her go.

430
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:57,002
Maybe coming here was a mistake.

431
01:03:57,806 --> 01:03:59,899
Don't second-guess yourself, Roy.

432
01:03:59,975 --> 01:04:03,638
Why not? Everybody else around here does.

433
01:04:03,712 --> 01:04:05,737
Don't attack me over this.

434
01:04:07,282 --> 01:04:09,011
I should have sold.

435
01:04:11,353 --> 01:04:13,719
- Damn it.
- What?

436
01:04:20,496 --> 01:04:24,330
Right after we got here,
there was another offer on the place.

437
01:04:26,435 --> 01:04:29,700
We would have made our money back,
plus another 15% .

438
01:04:36,678 --> 01:04:39,545
And you didn't even mention this to me?

439
01:04:39,615 --> 01:04:43,142
How could I?
You would have taken the offer on the spot.

440
01:04:43,952 --> 01:04:47,115
So you make this decision
without even telling me?

441
01:04:47,189 --> 01:04:50,989
I held this family together for two years
while you were looking for a job.

442
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:55,996
And then I come all the way out here
when you decided this was the answer.

443
01:04:56,064 --> 01:04:59,898
And now we had another option
and you didn't even tell me about it?

444
01:04:59,968 --> 01:05:02,198
You held this family together?

445
01:05:03,005 --> 01:05:06,532
Is that why you and Jess can't even be in
the same room for more than five minutes?

446
01:05:06,608 --> 01:05:08,735
No wonder the girl's a mess.

447
01:05:12,548 --> 01:05:15,984
Damn, Denise. Denise, I'm sorry.

448
01:05:19,154 --> 01:05:20,382
Damn it.

449
01:05:38,273 --> 01:05:39,365
Damn.

450
01:05:44,646 --> 01:05:46,136
Everything okay, Roy?

451
01:05:46,215 --> 01:05:49,673
No matter what I do,
I can't keep this family together.

452
01:06:10,405 --> 01:06:12,134
Hey. You all right?

453
01:06:13,242 --> 01:06:14,971
Do you want a ride?

454
01:06:18,447 --> 01:06:20,415
So where are we going?

455
01:06:20,482 --> 01:06:22,643
Feed store.

456
01:06:22,718 --> 01:06:23,810
Why?

457
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:30,124
Bobby, I'm gonna tell you something.

458
01:06:30,192 --> 01:06:34,128
And I need you to believe me,
because nobody else does.

459
01:06:34,196 --> 01:06:35,254
Okay.

460
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:37,628
I don't think the Rollins just up and left.

461
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:40,099
What are you talking about, Jess?

462
01:06:40,535 --> 01:06:42,628
I think something really terrible
happened to them.

463
01:06:42,704 --> 01:06:45,298
I think they're dead. I've seen them.

464
01:06:46,608 --> 01:06:48,337
You've seen ghosts?

465
01:06:55,484 --> 01:06:59,420
- Have you talked to your parents?
- I've tried but they won't listen to me.

466
01:06:59,488 --> 01:07:00,546
Why?

467
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:04,991
Back in Chicago, I messed up.

468
01:07:09,765 --> 01:07:14,327
Like, six months ago, my mom was picking
up my dad from the airport.

469
01:07:14,403 --> 01:07:18,237
And his flight was late,
so she called to see if I could

470
01:07:18,307 --> 01:07:22,004
pick up my little brother
from the babysitter's house.

471
01:07:22,077 --> 01:07:27,105
And I should have told her
that I'd been drinking with my friends but...

472
01:07:27,182 --> 01:07:29,810
I mean, it wasn't like
I was wasted or anything,

473
01:07:29,885 --> 01:07:31,284
and I thought I was okay to drive.

474
01:07:31,353 --> 01:07:36,916
But we got in a wreck,
and Ben had to go to the hospital.

475
01:07:38,627 --> 01:07:40,959
And he hasn't talked since then.

476
01:07:43,498 --> 01:07:47,366
I mean, they just haven't let it go yet.

477
01:07:50,105 --> 01:07:52,505
Everybody makes mistakes, Jess.

478
01:07:58,747 --> 01:07:59,839
Yeah.

479
01:08:00,349 --> 01:08:02,647
Your sister's going to be okay.

480
01:08:03,185 --> 01:08:04,652
Right, Benny?

481
01:08:06,755 --> 01:08:08,484
Say, "Right, Mama."

482
01:08:21,136 --> 01:08:23,366
What are you pointing at, Ben?

483
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,608
What do you see?

484
01:08:29,277 --> 01:08:31,177
What does it look like?

485
01:09:05,447 --> 01:09:06,937
What the hell?

486
01:09:52,494 --> 01:09:55,395
Okay, honey.
Lie down for your nap, sweetie.

487
01:09:56,498 --> 01:09:58,659
You okay? All right.

488
01:11:00,328 --> 01:11:03,627
The woman in this watch,
I remember seeing her here.

489
01:11:06,401 --> 01:11:07,561
There!

490
01:11:10,338 --> 01:11:11,703
That's her.

491
01:11:16,878 --> 01:11:18,140
Oh, my God.

492
01:11:18,213 --> 01:11:20,443
- What is it?
- I got to get home.

493
01:11:24,686 --> 01:11:27,780
Ben, honey. We got to get out of here.

494
01:11:29,724 --> 01:11:31,715
Honey, come on.

495
01:12:15,737 --> 01:12:19,002
Mama will be right there.
Mama will be right there.

496
01:12:20,275 --> 01:12:22,971
All right. Stay right there. All right, okay.

497
01:12:23,044 --> 01:12:26,480
Mama will be right there.
You stay right there.

498
01:12:27,248 --> 01:12:28,909
Oh, my God, John.

499
01:12:29,784 --> 01:12:31,547
Where are you going?

500
01:12:33,388 --> 01:12:35,515
Where are you going, Mary?

501
01:12:37,392 --> 01:12:38,484
What?

502
01:12:41,329 --> 01:12:42,796
What is this?

503
01:12:45,133 --> 01:12:46,862
Are you leaving me?

504
01:12:47,702 --> 01:12:49,932
- I don't...
- Shut up!

505
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:51,971
No, don't...

506
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:56,208
I've been working my ass off every day.

507
01:12:56,778 --> 01:12:59,508
- It's never good enough for you, is it?
- Oh, God.

508
01:13:01,316 --> 01:13:05,150
Did you really think
that I could ever let you leave me?

509
01:13:13,928 --> 01:13:15,190
Michael.

510
01:13:24,172 --> 01:13:26,800
Open this door! Open this door, Mary!

511
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:39,377
Mom?

512
01:13:43,358 --> 01:13:44,416
Dad?

513
01:13:56,271 --> 01:13:57,329
Mom?

514
01:14:08,983 --> 01:14:10,041
Mom?

515
01:14:11,586 --> 01:14:12,644
Ben?

516
01:14:49,457 --> 01:14:50,481
Go!

517
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:07,968
Bobby, wait!

518
01:15:08,042 --> 01:15:09,304
- What?
- My brother.

519
01:15:09,377 --> 01:15:12,744
- He's not here. Let's go.
- Bobby, watch out!

520
01:15:22,357 --> 01:15:24,848
Open the door!

521
01:15:37,338 --> 01:15:38,396
Mom?

522
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:56,948
Mom.

523
01:15:57,358 --> 01:15:58,620
Oh, Jess.

524
01:16:00,061 --> 01:16:02,291
I know what you were seeing.

525
01:16:02,363 --> 01:16:05,890
I've seen it, too.
I'm so sorry I didn't trust you.

526
01:16:13,308 --> 01:16:15,333
Mom, I've got to find a way out of here.

527
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:16,809
- Okay?
- Okay.

528
01:16:20,448 --> 01:16:25,044
Mary. Do you think
I would let you walk out on this family?

529
01:16:28,923 --> 01:16:30,823
Open the door, Lindsay.

530
01:16:36,664 --> 01:16:38,359
Open the door!

531
01:17:13,434 --> 01:17:15,299
You're not leaving me.

532
01:18:23,638 --> 01:18:26,436
Be quiet, sweetheart. Be quiet.

533
01:18:38,386 --> 01:18:40,650
Bobby? Bobby!

534
01:18:46,728 --> 01:18:49,322
Where are they, Bobby? Where are they?

535
01:19:04,012 --> 01:19:05,206
Denise?

536
01:19:06,881 --> 01:19:09,509
- Dad?
- Jess.

537
01:19:09,584 --> 01:19:10,676
Dad!

538
01:19:14,088 --> 01:19:16,522
You've been a bad girl, Lindsay.

539
01:19:23,064 --> 01:19:25,225
No! Leave her alone!

540
01:19:29,904 --> 01:19:31,394
Come here!

541
01:19:33,474 --> 01:19:37,035
Why are you always trying to run away
from me, Lindsay?

542
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:41,307
What's the matter with you?

543
01:19:42,183 --> 01:19:44,515
Don't you like your family?

544
01:19:48,189 --> 01:19:51,124
My family is going to stick together!

545
01:19:59,534 --> 01:20:01,661
We're not your family!

546
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:10,264
Mom?

547
01:21:18,446 --> 01:21:19,504
Dad!

548
01:21:24,285 --> 01:21:25,513
I got you.

549
01:21:41,802 --> 01:21:43,030
Hold on!

550
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:33,082
Hey, honey, it's me.

551
01:22:34,989 --> 01:22:37,082
It's gonna be all right.

552
01:22:38,759 --> 01:22:41,819
Mrs. Solomon,
I have just a few more questions.

553
01:22:57,612 --> 01:22:59,409
You're gonna be okay.

554
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:24,731
Excuse us, please.

555
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:26,537
Let's get him in.

556
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:58,065
Maybe now they can rest, Ben.

557
01:24:07,682 --> 01:24:09,650
- Hey.
- Hey.

558
01:24:09,717 --> 01:24:12,550
- You thirsty?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

559
01:24:18,659 --> 01:24:20,456
So, how's it going?

560
01:24:21,829 --> 01:24:23,319
Getting there.

561
01:24:25,032 --> 01:24:27,626
What's up there, dude? What's in the sky?

562
01:24:27,702 --> 01:24:30,432
- That. Birdie.
- What's that?

563
01:24:32,373 --> 01:24:36,639
- Is that a cloud?
- Crow. That's a crow.

564
01:24:41,916 --> 01:24:43,440
How about that?
