1
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,501
Mom?

2
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,962
Hey, sweetie.

3
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:50,798
What are you doing up? Come here.

4
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:52,466
I don't like my room.

5
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:54,635
No?

6
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:59,014
That's okay. You know,
you're still getting used to it.

7
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:00,975
I can't sleep either.

8
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:03,602
What are you looking at?

9
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:06,480
Some old photos. You want to see?

10
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:14,863
- Do you know who that is?
- No.

11
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:18,075
- It's me.
- It doesn't look like you.

12
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:23,664
I know. But that's me. That's your mom.

13
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:26,709
I was a kid once, too,
believe it or not.

14
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:28,752
You're old now.

15
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:32,965
- How old do you think I am?
- Really old.

16
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:35,926
Have a guess.

17
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:39,930
Probably at least 21.

18
00:06:43,017 --> 00:06:44,518
I wish you were right.

19
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,521
Show me a picture
of when Dad was a little kid.

20
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:50,274
You know, I wish I could.
But I don't think we have any.

21
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:52,776
He's really hopeless at keeping photos.

22
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,571
Show me a picture of
when I was a little kid.

23
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:59,408
You are a little kid. You're wonderful.

24
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:06,373
You certainly didn't cry
as much as your little sister.

25
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:09,293
But she's up, so let's go.
Get some breakfast.

26
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,795
- Billing department.
- Let me play.

27
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,130
- No.
- I want to play!

28
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:15,049
- I'm eating breakfast!
- Billing department. Careful.

29
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:16,258
I need a bowl, Mom

30
00:07:16,342 --> 00:07:18,927
I don't want to play soon.
I want to play now.

31
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:20,846
No, no, no, no.

32
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:22,222
Here, here.

33
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:26,101
- It's too small.
- Well, just make it work.

34
00:07:28,395 --> 00:07:32,691
Speak to an agent. Speak to an agent.

35
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:46,288
Oh, man, what?

36
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:49,166
Every time I think I've pulled you out,

37
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:51,752
you grow back in.

38
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:54,505
God.

39
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:57,383
- Good morning, guys.
- Speak to an agent!

40
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:58,509
I'm an agent.

41
00:07:58,592 --> 00:08:01,220
Yeah, hello, I would really like to keep
the old number if that's possible.

42
00:08:01,303 --> 00:08:03,555
- Dude, don't eat on the floor, Foster.
- But I'm pouring my cereal.

43
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,933
Can I have it by the end of the day,
please, because I...

44
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:09,228
Yes. Okay. Thank you.

45
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:12,439
Foster, can you please
get up off the floor?

46
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:14,274
Cap's loose.

47
00:08:19,446 --> 00:08:21,615
What is this? Is that wax?

48
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,743
We have no actual fruit?
We have wax fruit?

49
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:36,505
God damn it.

50
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:40,217
And, honey,
if you wanna look at my books,

51
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,885
please don't
leave them all over the floor.

52
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:43,220
I didn't touch your books.

53
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,472
- Bye.
- See you, Dad.

54
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:47,057
See you, buddy.

55
00:08:47,141 --> 00:08:48,379
You're not gonna take
the boys to school?

56
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,543
I can't today. Bye.

57
00:08:50,602 --> 00:08:52,980
- Are you gonna pick them up?
- I can't. I got a PTA meeting.

58
00:08:53,063 --> 00:08:54,606
- I totally forgot.
- Why didn't you tell me?

59
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,901
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, don't cry. Don't cry.

60
00:08:57,985 --> 00:08:59,027
I'll see you guys. Bye.

61
00:09:06,118 --> 00:09:09,496
Yeah, I'm looking west

62
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:13,834
Always been looking that way

63
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:18,505
I'm gonna get it all happening

64
00:09:19,214 --> 00:09:22,342
Just can't do it today

65
00:09:28,682 --> 00:09:31,268
Yeah, I'm looking west

66
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,856
Always been looking that way

67
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:40,235
I'm gonna be somebody

68
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:44,448
I just can't be her today

69
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,060
- Hello?
- Daddy!

70
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:40,022
Hey, buddy, slow down...

71
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:43,400
- This is awesome!
- Share it with your brother.

72
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:44,735
- Okay.
- Share with your brother.

73
00:11:44,818 --> 00:11:46,189
- Come watch TV with me.
- All right.

74
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:48,047
Look at this, babe. Nice job!

75
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:50,866
- Yes, it's getting there.
- Getting there?

76
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:53,243
- It looks awesome.
- Thanks.

77
00:11:54,077 --> 00:11:55,120
- Hey.
- Hi.

78
00:12:17,684 --> 00:12:19,895
Have you seen
my box of sheet music anywhere?

79
00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:23,273
I don't know, babe.
I know we packed them.

80
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:25,442
I packed them. I know.
I just... I can't find them.

81
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:28,487
I think the movers might have put them
in the dining room.

82
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,822
- Come here, baby girl, come here.
- It's not in the dining room.

83
00:12:30,906 --> 00:12:33,867
I've unpacked every single box,
and it's just vanished.

84
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:35,243
I can't find it.

85
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:39,539
We'll find them. We'll find them.

86
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:18,764
Dalton, honey? Where are you?

87
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:24,478
Stay here.
Foster, stay with your sister.

88
00:14:25,437 --> 00:14:26,897
- Dalton?
- Dalton!

89
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,106
Dalton!

90
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,318
- Hey!
- What?

91
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:34,071
- Hey, hey. Hey.
- What happened?

92
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:36,106
Did you fall?
Did you fall off the ladder?

93
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,074
Honey, did you fail down?

94
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:38,408
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

95
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:39,910
- What are you doing climbing the ladder?
- Honey...

96
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:42,829
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Are you okay?

97
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,874
- What hurts? What hurts?
- My leg.

98
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:50,003
All right. Can you move it?
Can you move your leg? Is that okay?

99
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:51,546
- Yeah.
- Okay.

100
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:53,465
Oh, man. What happened to your head?

101
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:55,008
- Oh, gosh!
- Scraped it.

102
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:56,301
Okay.

103
00:14:58,053 --> 00:15:00,972
Honey, you cannot come up here, okay?
Do not explore anymore.

104
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:03,725
It's very dangerous, okay?
It's off limits now.

105
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:06,436
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Okay. Okay. It's okay. It's okay.

106
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,022
- Can you stand on it? Be careful.
- I think so.

107
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:10,607
I got you. Come here.

108
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,318
What are you doing?
You scared us, buddy.

109
00:15:14,152 --> 00:15:16,780
You were just doing a little exploring?

110
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:17,989
Yeah.

111
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:30,085
- So, no more exploring up there, okay?
- Okay.

112
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:34,881
Yeah, you may be a superhero, buddy,
but you're not invincible.

113
00:15:35,048 --> 00:15:37,384
- You gotta be careful, all right?
- Okay.

114
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:39,052
Yeah.

115
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:43,431
Good night, sweetie.

116
00:15:46,518 --> 00:15:47,894
So were you putting boxes away upstairs?

117
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:49,938
Don't, Josh.

118
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:53,191
I just hate feeling helpless. Sorry.

119
00:15:53,984 --> 00:15:55,569
I'll figure out a way
to lock the door tomorrow.

120
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:58,363
Good. It's dangerous, you know.

121
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:01,324
Maybe we should just put him
on a child leash.

122
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,243
I'll stop at the pet store tomorrow.

123
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm sorry I was pissy
when you got home from work today.

124
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,710
No, didn't notice.

125
00:16:11,793 --> 00:16:15,755
I was trying
to do some work today and then

126
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:21,303
Cali woke up after a half hour,
and she wouldn't go back down,

127
00:16:22,387 --> 00:16:24,014
and I just didn't get anything done.

128
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:30,937
I just want things to be different
in this house.

129
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:34,733
I just had such a bad day.
I'm scared nothing is gonna change.

130
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:38,278
It will, I promise you.
We've just got to give it time.

131
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:45,785
Thanks for letting me take some time
to work on my music.

132
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:48,121
Come on, I want you to do it.

133
00:16:49,664 --> 00:16:53,084
I think I have a couple of good songs.
I mean, not all of them, but I think...

134
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:56,546
You know, there's a few that
I can do something with.

135
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:58,924
I love all your songs.

136
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:01,468
- Shut up. You do not!
- I do. Stop it.

137
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:05,680
Which one's your favorite?

138
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:11,770
- You should write a song about me.
- They're all about you.

139
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:14,105
Like how cool I am.

140
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:17,776
- Like, "He's the coolest guy..."
- No, no, no, no, no.

141
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:21,863
- No, no, no. Quiet.
- "Big muscles!"

142
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:25,992
- "Really, really pretty!"
- You'll wake up the baby.

143
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:18,503
Foster,
can you finish your eggs, please?

144
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:21,214
Hey, Cali.

145
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,427
- Can you go wake up Dalton, Josh?
- Yeah.

146
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:32,183
Hey, Mr. Sleepy-pants. Get up.

147
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:39,232
Hey, Sleepy-pants.
You'd better get out of that bed

148
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:42,110
or your mother's gonna kill us both.

149
00:18:45,697 --> 00:18:47,574
Dalton, come on, buddy.
You gotta get ready for school.

150
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:52,162
Hey. Hey.

151
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:56,291
Dalton.

152
00:18:59,502 --> 00:19:00,712
Dalton?

153
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:06,301
Dalton. Dalton. Dalton. Dalton!

154
00:19:07,218 --> 00:19:10,597
There is no brain damage
that we've detected.

155
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:13,433
Technically, yes, he's in a coma.

156
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:16,644
He doesn't react to stimuli.
He has no sleep-wake cycle.

157
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:19,002
But there's
no brain trauma or infection.

158
00:19:19,087 --> 00:19:20,965
His scans are all normal.

159
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:24,152
To be honest,
I've never seen anything like it.

160
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:28,323
But he can't just not wake up. I mean...

161
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:31,701
There's got to be something.

162
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:33,828
I'm sorry.

163
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:37,916
Okay, so what do we do?

164
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,586
- Does he stay here? Do we...
- We'll conduct some further testing.

165
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:44,964
It's only been a couple of days.
It could take a little longer for...

166
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:48,301
Excuse me a minute. I have to step out.
I'll be back in just a moment.

167
00:19:49,135 --> 00:19:51,638
Dr. Sercarz,
how long will the tests take?

168
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:11,574
Okay, so what I've done here is I've
inserted a nasogastric feeding tube.

169
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:14,744
To get the length of the tube
that I'm gonna need,

170
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:18,373
I measure from the tip of the nose
to the earlobe

171
00:20:18,581 --> 00:20:21,584
and down to the xiphoid process,
which is here.

172
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:25,004
Then I usually mark that off
with some tape.

173
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:28,258
And then you need to lubricate
the end of the tube

174
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:31,177
that I'm going to insert about 4 inches.

175
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:35,598
And then I just slide it in like that.

176
00:20:35,682 --> 00:20:37,420
I have to make sure the end
of the tube is curved

177
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:39,241
and that his head is a little bent,

178
00:20:39,352 --> 00:20:41,583
a little bent back.

179
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:46,359
And then we usually hold it in place
with some surgical tape.

180
00:20:46,443 --> 00:20:47,944
And that's it.

181
00:20:48,987 --> 00:20:52,615
If there are any problems
or any bleeding, just call me, okay?

182
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:52,300
There's nothing you can do.
Nothing you can do.

183
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,336
I want if!

184
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:31,381
Give me it! Give me it! I want it!

185
00:22:31,923 --> 00:22:33,633
I want it! Now!

186
00:22:49,732 --> 00:22:52,777
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

187
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,990
It's okay. It's okay.

188
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:02,662
It's okay. It's okay.

189
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:34,319
What's this?

190
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:36,112
An award.

191
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:41,451
That's today's date.
Did you get this today?

192
00:23:43,161 --> 00:23:45,788
Honey, why didn't you tell us?

193
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,105
I know it's hard right now,

194
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,174
but things are going to get better,
I promise.

195
00:23:58,718 --> 00:24:00,053
I'm gonna show this to your dad.

196
00:24:00,553 --> 00:24:02,138
It's fantastic.

197
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,895
I'm scared, Mom.

198
00:24:13,107 --> 00:24:15,735
- Scared of what?
- Dalton.

199
00:24:16,444 --> 00:24:18,237
Can I change rooms?

200
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:21,949
Why would you want to change rooms?

201
00:24:22,075 --> 00:24:24,994
I don't like
when he walks around at night.

202
00:25:38,776 --> 00:25:41,237
Something really weird happened
to me today.

203
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:42,780
What?

204
00:25:43,364 --> 00:25:45,658
I heard this noise coming
from Cali's room.

205
00:25:46,117 --> 00:25:49,287
It was on the baby monitor.
It was like voices.

206
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,541
And I ran up here and I had a look,
but there was no one in there.

207
00:25:54,876 --> 00:25:56,836
It was probably just interference.

208
00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:59,255
Those things are always picking up
somebody else's signal.

209
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:01,424
I don't know. It sounded so clear.

210
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:03,342
It was like this whispering.

211
00:26:03,426 --> 00:26:06,679
It was... It scared the hell out of me.

212
00:26:06,888 --> 00:26:09,265
I was at the piano,
and I could hear it on the monitor,

213
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:11,726
and I turned up the volume and...

214
00:26:13,978 --> 00:26:15,396
Who the hell is that?

215
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:20,443
Hold on.

216
00:26:21,402 --> 00:26:22,528
Stay here.

217
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:43,341
Who is it?

218
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:04,737
Jesus.

219
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:19,794
Hello?

220
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,539
Oh, my God! Josh! Josh! Josh!

221
00:27:56,622 --> 00:27:59,458
Please. Someone's in Cali's room!
Someone's in Cali's room!

222
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:01,961
There's someone there! I saw somebody!

223
00:28:03,796 --> 00:28:06,299
He was standing right there!
He was standing right there!

224
00:28:10,636 --> 00:28:12,471
- There's nobody here.
- I saw someone!

225
00:28:15,141 --> 00:28:18,352
Okay, take her, get Foster,
go in Dalton's room.

226
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:34,869
- Foster!
- What's going on?

227
00:28:34,952 --> 00:28:36,871
The alarm's gone off!

228
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:45,231
God damn it!

229
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:05,918
Thanks, guys.

230
00:30:09,463 --> 00:30:10,715
I'll see you tomorrow.

231
00:30:22,727 --> 00:30:24,395
Hey, honey. It's me.

232
00:30:25,312 --> 00:30:29,108
They just told me, I've got to... I'm
gonna have to stay late tonight to...

233
00:30:29,191 --> 00:30:32,695
I gotta grade some tests,
and it's gonna be a while so...

234
00:30:33,696 --> 00:30:35,053
You don't have to wait up, okay?

235
00:30:35,184 --> 00:30:38,284
I'll be home as soon as I can.
I love you.

236
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:19,742
Did he respond to any of the new tests?

237
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:22,453
No. No, he didn't.

238
00:31:23,162 --> 00:31:25,206
But we have to give it time.

239
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:27,625
I've seen coma patients
with a much longer inactivity time

240
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,919
suddenly start making noises.

241
00:31:31,003 --> 00:31:35,508
He's not in a coma.
They don't know what to call it.

242
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:40,679
They don't know what to do with him,

243
00:31:41,847 --> 00:31:43,808
so they've just given up.

244
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:47,770
I feel like the universe is just

245
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:51,524
trying to see how far
I'll bend before I break.

246
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:55,694
Well, the universe picked a fight
with the wrong chick.

247
00:31:59,365 --> 00:32:01,367
That's okay. I got it.

248
00:32:02,993 --> 00:32:04,370
Thank you.

249
00:32:12,253 --> 00:32:13,379
Okay.

250
00:32:58,757 --> 00:33:01,135
Josh, where are you?

251
00:33:01,385 --> 00:33:04,346
I need you to come home now, please.

252
00:33:20,112 --> 00:33:21,447
L' ['S 10230.

253
00:33:24,658 --> 00:33:27,494
You've been coming home late
every single night.

254
00:33:28,537 --> 00:33:31,081
In all the years you've worked at the
school, you've never had to do that.

255
00:33:31,165 --> 00:33:33,834
Why all of a sudden
are you staying back late?

256
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:37,171
You know, I don't like it either.
I was grading tests. I mean...

257
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:39,882
What choice do I have?

258
00:33:39,965 --> 00:33:41,967
- I've got to pay Dalton's bills.
- Josh.

259
00:33:42,218 --> 00:33:45,471
I'm scared. I'm so scared and...

260
00:33:46,972 --> 00:33:49,225
I'm scared. He's my son, too.

261
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:53,020
You don't understand.
I'm scared for Dalton.

262
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:55,105
I'm scared of this house.

263
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:02,238
There's something wrong with this place.

264
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:04,657
I'm not imagining it. I can feel it.

265
00:34:05,616 --> 00:34:06,742
It's like a sickness.

266
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:10,412
Ever since we've moved in,
everything's just gone wrong.

267
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:16,794
You think our house is haunted?

268
00:34:17,086 --> 00:34:19,213
I don't think it. I know it.

269
00:34:19,463 --> 00:34:21,257
Things move around in here
by themselves.

270
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,678
I walk into the kitchen at night
to get a drink, I can feel eyes on me.

271
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:30,474
I can't be in there alone anymore.

272
00:34:31,058 --> 00:34:35,345
I need you. But you're never here.

273
00:34:35,562 --> 00:34:39,358
- Where are you?
- I told you. I was grading tests.

274
00:34:40,192 --> 00:34:44,488
That's not what I mean. You're not here
with me in this situation.

275
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:46,615
You're just avoiding it,

276
00:34:47,574 --> 00:34:50,619
like everything stressful,
whether it's this or parking tickets.

277
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:54,623
Oh, God. Stop saying that, okay?
I don't avoid stressful situations.

278
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:57,793
I'm just dealing with it
in my own fucking way.

279
00:35:07,928 --> 00:35:09,888
Fine. Deal with this!

280
00:36:21,126 --> 00:36:22,294
Jesus.

281
00:36:23,128 --> 00:36:24,380
Oh, God.

282
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,026
Josh?

283
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:52,491
Josh.

284
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:09,466
Renai?

285
00:37:13,554 --> 00:37:14,721
Renai!

286
00:37:16,557 --> 00:37:18,851
- What, what, what? What is it?
- There's someone here.

287
00:37:18,934 --> 00:37:20,436
There's someone in the room!

288
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:24,022
He was right there, I swear!

289
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:31,530
Don't you dare not believe me.

290
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:35,325
Please. Please, believe me.

291
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:37,369
I swear he was right there.

292
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:39,872
I do, I do. I do believe you.

293
00:37:39,997 --> 00:37:42,082
I just don't know
what you want me to do.

294
00:37:42,207 --> 00:37:45,419
I want to leave. Please.
I want to leave this house.

295
00:37:45,502 --> 00:37:47,838
I can't spend
another night here. Please!

296
00:37:48,338 --> 00:37:51,008
- Please, help me!
- Okay, okay, okay.

297
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:54,052
We're going.

298
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:18,660
Lorraine, please, you shouldn't be
doing any of this. Just sit down.

299
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:20,829
I'm perfectly capable
of putting a few things away.

300
00:38:20,913 --> 00:38:22,289
I did it for Josh his Whole life.

301
00:38:22,372 --> 00:38:24,875
I know, but I feel terrible.

302
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:30,672
I think it's you who should be
sitting down by the looks of it.

303
00:38:34,676 --> 00:38:37,429
I can't believe you got Josh
to hold still for a photo.

304
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:42,518
What I can't believe is that
we are doing this all over again.

305
00:38:43,685 --> 00:38:45,062
Ridiculous.

306
00:38:49,942 --> 00:38:52,027
You must think I'm crazy.

307
00:38:53,028 --> 00:38:54,238
Nobody,

308
00:38:54,863 --> 00:38:58,617
not me or anybody, knows
what you're going through right now.

309
00:38:59,076 --> 00:39:02,287
Whatever you have to do
to get through it, do it.

310
00:39:03,747 --> 00:39:06,667
And you don't have to apologize
for anything.

311
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:11,421
Thanks.

312
00:42:28,702 --> 00:42:29,911
Dalton?

313
00:43:18,835 --> 00:43:22,422
Your faith can help. Trust it, you know.

314
00:43:23,215 --> 00:43:25,217
- Hello.
- Josh.

315
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:29,095
This is the first line of a joke, right?

316
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:31,890
A guy comes home to find his wife
with a priest.

317
00:43:32,724 --> 00:43:34,976
- This is Liam Martin.
- Nice to meet you.

318
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:37,268
He's actually a very old friend of mine.

319
00:43:37,687 --> 00:43:40,816
- This is my husband, Josh.
- What's going on here?

320
00:43:40,899 --> 00:43:41,983
- I should be going.
- Thank you.

321
00:43:42,067 --> 00:43:43,068
Thank you so much.

322
00:43:43,151 --> 00:43:45,403
Thank you so much for the tea.

323
00:43:48,406 --> 00:43:51,409
This thing from the other house

324
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:54,579
has followed us here.

325
00:43:54,788 --> 00:43:58,416
I saw something today.

326
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:02,504
I thought it was a little boy.
I followed it into Dalton's room.

327
00:44:02,587 --> 00:44:05,757
But it wasn't a child.
It was something else.

328
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,304
So what? You just
brought a priest in to get rid of it?

329
00:44:12,305 --> 00:44:14,099
I didn't know what else to do, Josh.

330
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:15,934
Come on, Renal.

331
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:19,187
When's the last time you went to church?

332
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,442
What's happening to Renai is real.

333
00:44:25,318 --> 00:44:26,820
I've seen it for myself.

334
00:44:29,698 --> 00:44:33,869
I came today because last night
I had a dream about this place.

335
00:44:35,495 --> 00:44:38,790
I was in this house,
but it was late at night.

336
00:44:42,252 --> 00:44:44,296
I was afraid.

337
00:44:50,302 --> 00:44:53,597
I went into your bedroom,
but you were both asleep.

338
00:44:57,017 --> 00:44:59,769
I knew I was asleep in the dream,

339
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,773
but I could feel that
someone was awake

340
00:45:04,566 --> 00:45:06,026
in the house.

341
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:10,196
I went into Dalton's room.

342
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:25,003
There was something in there with him.

343
00:45:29,925 --> 00:45:31,968
It was standing there in the corner.

344
00:45:36,681 --> 00:45:39,559
I asked it, "Who are you?"

345
00:45:39,643 --> 00:45:42,687
And it said it was a visitor.

346
00:45:44,606 --> 00:45:46,232
I said, "What do you want?"

347
00:45:52,864 --> 00:45:54,115
It said, "Dalton."

348
00:46:00,038 --> 00:46:02,207
I can still hear that voice.

349
00:46:07,587 --> 00:46:08,880
What? What?

350
00:46:09,422 --> 00:46:11,424
- It's here!
- What?

351
00:46:38,952 --> 00:46:40,161
Jesus!

352
00:46:40,412 --> 00:46:41,538
Oh, my God!

353
00:46:46,876 --> 00:46:48,420
Okay. He's okay.

354
00:46:48,753 --> 00:46:51,548
Please! Please, help him! Please!

355
00:46:56,302 --> 00:46:57,554
I know someone who can help

356
00:46:59,848 --> 00:47:02,017
if you're willing to ask.

357
00:47:08,189 --> 00:47:10,233
I'm Specs. This is Tucker.

358
00:47:11,276 --> 00:47:12,527
- I'm Renai. Hi.
- Hi.

359
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:14,779
- You must be Josh.
- Yeah. Hi.

360
00:47:15,405 --> 00:47:18,491
That wasn't psychic.
Elise already told me your name so...

361
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,452
Where is Elise?

362
00:47:20,535 --> 00:47:23,204
She sent us ahead
to do some preliminary tests.

363
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:25,832
Helps weed out the nut jobs.

364
00:47:34,049 --> 00:47:36,718
- What is that?
- It's a Trifield meter.

365
00:47:36,801 --> 00:47:38,511
Measures DC fields

366
00:47:38,595 --> 00:47:41,973
and the natural
electromagnetic environment.

367
00:47:43,016 --> 00:47:46,061
Yeah, sometimes old wiring
can leak into the atmosphere.

368
00:47:46,144 --> 00:47:48,813
It causes hallucinations,
changes in energy.

369
00:47:49,147 --> 00:47:51,900
It's a little more important than that,
but whatever.

370
00:47:52,192 --> 00:47:54,444
The tech stuff's not really relevant
to you guys anyway.

371
00:47:54,527 --> 00:47:55,653
It's all very relevant, actually.

372
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:10,502
What?

373
00:48:11,836 --> 00:48:13,505
Starfleet Series One.

374
00:48:15,924 --> 00:48:17,050
It's hard to find.

375
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:20,095
Should have kept it in its box.

376
00:48:23,348 --> 00:48:26,017
This device measures changes
in UV light.

377
00:48:26,392 --> 00:48:28,019
I make all this equipment myself,
you know.

378
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,438
It's impressive.

379
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,273
Thanks.

380
00:48:33,733 --> 00:48:36,401
It's not that hard
if you know what you're doing.

381
00:48:37,028 --> 00:48:40,156
Yeah,
that one's basically a modified toy.

382
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:46,037
I'm gonna need some time alone
to concentrate.

383
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,361
This field is...
Look, the body is made up of energy.

384
00:50:00,445 --> 00:50:04,157
- Where does that energy go when we die?
- We can call Elise.

385
00:50:05,158 --> 00:50:06,242
Now.

386
00:50:10,955 --> 00:50:13,708
I wasn't sure the doorbell was working.
I'm sorry.

387
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:15,210
- That's fine. Come on in.
- Thank you.

388
00:50:15,293 --> 00:50:16,794
Mrs. Rainier?

389
00:50:16,878 --> 00:50:19,547
No, Mrs. Rainier is my mother.
Just call me Elise.

390
00:50:19,797 --> 00:50:21,799
- I'm Josh.
- I knew that.

391
00:50:22,508 --> 00:50:24,260
You've grown since I last saw you.

392
00:50:25,136 --> 00:50:26,638
Since you last saw me?

393
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:30,016
Your mother and I have been friends
a long time.

394
00:50:31,768 --> 00:50:34,145
- Well, hello.
- This is my wife, Renai.

395
00:50:34,229 --> 00:50:36,272
- How do you do?
- Hi, thank you for coming.

396
00:50:36,356 --> 00:50:39,067
- Thank you for having me.
- Can we get you anything, Elise?

397
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:41,236
No, I'm fine, thank you so much.

398
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:44,989
We took Trifield and EMF readings
of the whole house,

399
00:50:45,073 --> 00:50:47,909
all the wiring,
alarm clocks, radios, toasters,

400
00:50:47,992 --> 00:50:52,914
TV, record player, fuse box, nothing
went off the charts except for the...

401
00:50:52,997 --> 00:50:54,165
And the previous home?

402
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:57,835
Tucker hadn't monitored that yet.
You know what? Don't even sweat it.

403
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:00,296
I'll make myself available.
I'll get on that this afternoon.

404
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,715
Yeah, but I'll have to come, too,

405
00:51:02,799 --> 00:51:04,509
because who's going to operate
the equipment?

406
00:51:04,592 --> 00:51:06,970
Well, strictly, I could do it without...

407
00:51:07,053 --> 00:51:09,013
- Yeah, but I need to oversee...
- Yeah, but it's not...

408
00:51:09,097 --> 00:51:10,269
That's fine, gentlemen.

409
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:13,926
I don't think bad wiring
is the problem here.

410
00:51:16,729 --> 00:51:18,523
May I walk through the house?

411
00:51:18,606 --> 00:51:20,233
- Sure, of course.
- Thank you.

412
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,860
Your other children
are with Lorraine, right?

413
00:51:22,944 --> 00:51:24,529
Yeah, they are.

414
00:51:25,822 --> 00:51:27,156
Steven, do you have your sketchbook?

415
00:51:27,448 --> 00:51:28,574
Yes. Yes, I do.

416
00:51:29,033 --> 00:51:31,160
Good. 'Cause we're gonna need it.

417
00:51:31,244 --> 00:51:33,037
What do you need that for?

418
00:51:33,788 --> 00:51:35,498
She tells me what she sees,
and I draw it.

419
00:51:35,581 --> 00:51:37,667
It's the most important part
of her process.

420
00:51:37,959 --> 00:51:39,794
- That's debatable.
- It's not debatable.

421
00:51:39,877 --> 00:51:41,629
It is, but whatever.

422
00:51:46,175 --> 00:51:47,885
Leave the light off.

423
00:52:01,399 --> 00:52:02,775
Hey, Dalton.

424
00:52:04,902 --> 00:52:07,196
You are a very handsome boy.

425
00:52:08,614 --> 00:52:11,659
Your mom and dad are here,
so don't you worry.

426
00:52:27,675 --> 00:52:29,218
What? What...

427
00:52:32,847 --> 00:52:33,931
The face...

428
00:52:34,807 --> 00:52:35,808
What?

429
00:52:36,726 --> 00:52:38,269
Blood red face.

430
00:52:39,103 --> 00:52:41,898
Black... Black arms. Black legs.

431
00:52:42,774 --> 00:52:44,317
Black body.

432
00:52:51,491 --> 00:52:52,658
Slow down.

433
00:52:52,742 --> 00:52:54,952
- His feet are black. His legs are black.
- Slow down.

434
00:52:57,288 --> 00:52:58,331
What is it?

435
00:52:59,415 --> 00:53:00,833
Oh, my God.

436
00:53:04,754 --> 00:53:07,924
And pitch black eyes.
They're like two dark holes.

437
00:53:12,261 --> 00:53:14,180
He has hooves for feet.

438
00:53:15,264 --> 00:53:18,226
- What?
- And long spidery fingernails.

439
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:19,394
Elise, what's......

440
00:53:20,311 --> 00:53:21,521
Hey, what is that?

441
00:53:40,081 --> 00:53:43,084
I'm not sure if you're ready
to hear this yet,

442
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:47,171
but unfortunately, I can't waste
any time easing you into it.

443
00:53:48,756 --> 00:53:51,050
I want you to know,
this is what I believe,

444
00:53:51,134 --> 00:53:54,887
and it may contradict
a previous medical diagnosis, but...

445
00:53:55,138 --> 00:54:00,226
You called me here, and I'm taking that
as an acceptance of my readings. Yes?

446
00:54:03,187 --> 00:54:04,564
Yes, go on.

447
00:54:09,193 --> 00:54:10,945
Your son isn't in a coma.

448
00:54:11,028 --> 00:54:13,948
Falling off a ladder
had nothing to do with this.

449
00:54:14,031 --> 00:54:16,200
His physical body's here.

450
00:54:17,076 --> 00:54:19,120
But his spiritual body is not.

451
00:54:19,203 --> 00:54:23,291
And the reason these disturbances,
they followed you to a new home,

452
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:27,211
is because it's not the house
that's haunted.

453
00:54:30,173 --> 00:54:31,674
It's your son.

454
00:54:36,596 --> 00:54:38,389
I don't understand.

455
00:54:41,267 --> 00:54:42,935
Have you ever heard
of astral projection?

456
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,899
Yes. It's out of body experience
or something?

457
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:50,985
I like to call them travelers.

458
00:54:52,487 --> 00:54:56,616
You see, these are people with the
ability to leave their physical body

459
00:54:57,074 --> 00:55:00,244
and to travel to different places
in astral form.

460
00:55:00,953 --> 00:55:02,413
Now, Dalton,

461
00:55:03,331 --> 00:55:06,959
he is a very accomplished
astral projector.

462
00:55:08,419 --> 00:55:11,506
He's been doing it in his sleep
for a long time.

463
00:55:12,381 --> 00:55:14,634
He has been since he was very young.

464
00:55:15,593 --> 00:55:18,554
And he's unafraid
because he thinks they're dreams.

465
00:55:19,138 --> 00:55:23,809
And it's that very lack of fear
that has led him to travel too far.

466
00:55:24,644 --> 00:55:26,646
And to become lost.

467
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,606
Lost?

468
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,735
Lost where?

469
00:55:33,778 --> 00:55:36,322
In a place that I call the Further.

470
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,574
What? What does that mean?

471
00:55:39,992 --> 00:55:43,079
The Further is a world
far beyond our own,

472
00:55:43,287 --> 00:55:44,622
yet it's all around us,

473
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:47,458
a place without time as we know it.

474
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,712
It's a dark realm filled with
the tortured souls of the dead,

475
00:55:52,755 --> 00:55:54,507
a place not meant for the living.

476
00:55:57,969 --> 00:55:59,887
That's where Dalton is.

477
00:56:01,097 --> 00:56:04,016
And the problem
is that with his astral body gone,

478
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,645
he's just left us with a physical body,
an empty vessel.

479
00:56:08,354 --> 00:56:11,566
And there are entities that know this
because they can smell it.

480
00:56:12,066 --> 00:56:14,735
That's why they're gathered around him.

481
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:17,321
Are these the things that
I've been seeing?

482
00:56:23,911 --> 00:56:28,040
They're all trying to get inside of
his physical body simply because they...

483
00:56:28,124 --> 00:56:29,709
They crave life,

484
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:31,711
the chance to live again.

485
00:56:32,086 --> 00:56:34,338
But there are other entities

486
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,507
who are malevolent

487
00:56:38,175 --> 00:56:40,511
and have a more insidious agenda.

488
00:56:41,846 --> 00:56:44,056
And then, there's this.

489
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:51,105
A demon who seeks Dalton's body
for one reason:

490
00:56:52,148 --> 00:56:54,191
to cause pain to others.

491
00:56:57,486 --> 00:56:59,113
He is so desperate to possess Dalton,

492
00:56:59,196 --> 00:57:02,158
and he's the closest of all the entities
to getting inside of him.

493
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:03,909
What do you mean the closest?

494
00:57:03,993 --> 00:57:07,663
Because these entities, they can't
just walk into the bodies of the living

495
00:57:07,747 --> 00:57:09,040
anytime they please.

496
00:57:09,123 --> 00:57:12,793
To cross over from their realm,
it takes time. It takes energy.

497
00:57:12,877 --> 00:57:16,088
But the longer that Dalton's astral body

498
00:57:16,422 --> 00:57:20,593
is kept away from his physical body,
the weaker the link gets.

499
00:57:22,553 --> 00:57:24,555
The easier it is to possess him.

500
00:57:25,139 --> 00:57:28,517
Is there anything we can do
to bring Dalton back?

501
00:57:33,731 --> 00:57:35,066
There's something we could try.

502
00:57:36,192 --> 00:57:38,235
It's a little unorthodox.

503
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:42,573
But I would need your complete trust.

504
00:57:42,907 --> 00:57:45,368
No, no, no.
I'm sorry, this has gone too far.

505
00:57:45,451 --> 00:57:47,536
What? No, please, Josh.
You said you would give her a chance.

506
00:57:47,542 --> 00:57:50,612
I have given her a chance, honey, but I
can't have somebody coming into our home

507
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:52,750
and telling us the reason
our son is in a coma

508
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:56,003
is because his soul has floated off
somewhere in another dimension.

509
00:57:56,087 --> 00:57:59,924
We're gonna bring her all the way here
and not even consider what she's saying?

510
00:58:00,007 --> 00:58:04,178
I did this to make sure you could feel
at ease. And if it helped, great.

511
00:58:05,012 --> 00:58:09,266
I've listened to the dog and pony show.
I have seen the drawings.

512
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:10,976
But to bring Dalton into it, no.

513
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,687
But why is our son still in a coma?

514
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:15,022
Why can't the doctors tell us
what is wrong with him?

515
00:58:15,106 --> 00:58:17,858
How did the voice of reason
become the bad guy here?

516
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,695
Don't you see, Renai?
You want to believe. Anybody would.

517
00:58:20,778 --> 00:58:23,739
You don't believe me!
You don't believe me!

518
00:58:27,618 --> 00:58:29,537
I moved houses for you.

519
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,874
What do you mean, I don't believe you?
I'm on your side here.

520
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:40,548
But this,
this is dangerous and exploitative.

521
00:58:41,215 --> 00:58:44,051
You guys come into the home
of a seriously ill child,

522
00:58:44,135 --> 00:58:48,055
and you make some tenuous connection
between him

523
00:58:48,139 --> 00:58:51,475
and the images my wife is seeing,
and voila!

524
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:55,730
Tears validate your power, and thank you
very much, that will be $600 please.

525
00:58:56,021 --> 00:58:57,106
- Thank you for coming.
- Please. Please.

526
00:58:57,189 --> 00:59:00,317
- Thank you. No, I really understand.
- Please.

527
00:59:00,401 --> 00:59:03,154
Thank you for your hospitality.
Good luck.

528
00:59:03,571 --> 00:59:04,989
Oh, Jesus!

529
00:59:05,823 --> 00:59:07,575
Sorry to waste your time.

530
00:59:11,662 --> 00:59:13,122
Where are you, buddy?

531
00:59:16,459 --> 00:59:18,586
Did you go somewhere?

532
00:59:20,337 --> 00:59:21,380
No.

533
00:59:23,132 --> 00:59:27,344
No, you're right here.
You are right here.

534
00:59:30,723 --> 00:59:32,391
Can you hear me?

535
00:59:35,436 --> 00:59:38,773
I know you can hear me,
but you gotta show me, okay, buddy?

536
00:59:39,023 --> 00:59:41,984
You gotta show me that you can hear me.

537
01:00:55,891 --> 01:00:57,017
Okay.

538
01:01:10,364 --> 01:01:13,617
What's most important is that you
realize no two attempts are the same.

539
01:01:13,951 --> 01:01:16,871
I'm going to be completely honest
with you about the results.

540
01:01:16,954 --> 01:01:19,498
If there's no dialogue established,
I'm gonna tell you.

541
01:01:22,126 --> 01:01:25,921
These still cameras are rigged to
pick up any changes in the atmosphere,

542
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:29,341
both electrical or temperature-wise.

543
01:01:30,718 --> 01:01:32,136
Don't be alarmed if they go off

544
01:01:33,971 --> 01:01:36,105
You're gonna see
a lot of confusing things,

545
01:01:36,204 --> 01:01:37,438
things you don't understand.

546
01:01:37,518 --> 01:01:41,186
But do not question them
and do not speak in any way.

547
01:01:41,729 --> 01:01:43,898
I want you to know whatever I say
when I'm in tune

548
01:01:43,981 --> 01:01:46,483
is going to be at a very low volume.
You won't hear any of it.

549
01:01:46,567 --> 01:01:50,529
But Steven's gonna write it down.
He's going repeat it for you. Okay?

550
01:01:52,406 --> 01:01:53,866
Dim the lights, please.

551
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:43,749
We are calling out to you, Dalton.

552
01:02:46,543 --> 01:02:49,046
Tell us you're safe.
Tell us where you are.

553
01:02:49,129 --> 01:02:51,215
Tell us you're safe.
Tell us where you are.

554
01:02:58,389 --> 01:02:59,598
Dalton.

555
01:03:01,392 --> 01:03:04,103
Can you hear us? Answer us.

556
01:03:21,745 --> 01:03:22,955
Who's there?

557
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,175
Dalton, it's your mother and father.

558
01:03:38,929 --> 01:03:40,431
We've been searching for you.

559
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:43,392
Where are you?

560
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:54,153
I can't see in here.

561
01:03:54,945 --> 01:03:57,698
Dalton... Dalton, you don't need to see.

562
01:03:58,782 --> 01:04:00,868
Follow my voice.

563
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:04,580
Follow my voice, Dalton.

564
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:10,461
Dalton. Why aren't you...

565
01:04:10,919 --> 01:04:12,796
Why aren't you talking anymore?

566
01:04:14,131 --> 01:04:15,299
Dalton?

567
01:04:20,929 --> 01:04:25,017
If they hear me, they'll hurt me.

568
01:04:26,143 --> 01:04:27,436
Who will hurt you?

569
01:04:28,645 --> 01:04:30,022
Who will hurt you, Dalton?

570
01:04:36,153 --> 01:04:37,488
The man

571
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:41,325
with

572
01:04:42,743 --> 01:04:43,911
fire

573
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:50,167
on his face.

574
01:04:55,005 --> 01:04:56,215
Dalton.

575
01:04:56,965 --> 01:04:58,383
Dalton, can you find your way out?

576
01:05:00,344 --> 01:05:01,762
There is

577
01:05:02,429 --> 01:05:05,307
no way out.

578
01:05:06,767 --> 01:05:11,021
Follow my voice, Dalton.
Follow my voice.

579
01:05:12,523 --> 01:05:14,525
Be quiet.

580
01:05:15,609 --> 01:05:17,945
They'll hear you.

581
01:05:18,362 --> 01:05:21,073
They won't hear me, Dalton.
Follow my voice.

582
01:05:21,949 --> 01:05:23,534
Follow my voice.

583
01:05:25,077 --> 01:05:28,622
They heard you.

584
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:32,918
Oh, my God.

585
01:05:33,377 --> 01:05:36,547
Mommy and Daddy.

586
01:05:37,631 --> 01:05:39,174
Help. Help.

587
01:05:40,843 --> 01:05:45,722
Help me, help me, help.

588
01:05:49,143 --> 01:05:50,227
Dalton?

589
01:06:02,072 --> 01:06:04,408
You bitch.

590
01:07:05,093 --> 01:07:06,178
Dalton?

591
01:07:40,837 --> 01:07:41,964
Specs!

592
01:07:52,391 --> 01:07:54,184
Leave this vessel!

593
01:07:55,018 --> 01:07:56,520
- He's alive. He's alive, oh, God.
- He's alive? Jesus.

594
01:08:07,155 --> 01:08:08,907
Leave this vessel!

595
01:08:10,325 --> 01:08:13,745
Leave this vessel! Leave this vessel!

596
01:08:14,329 --> 01:08:15,789
Leave his body!

597
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:17,749
Tucker, turn on the light!

598
01:08:18,292 --> 01:08:21,169
Leave this body now!

599
01:08:27,384 --> 01:08:29,303
Come here, Dalton.

600
01:08:31,388 --> 01:08:32,889
Son. Come here.

601
01:08:35,142 --> 01:08:38,061
- He's alive. He's alive, oh, God.
- He's alive? Jesus.

602
01:08:38,312 --> 01:08:40,230
- Honey.
- Oh, God.

603
01:08:45,444 --> 01:08:50,073
Three cameras. Around the clock.
We got nothing.

604
01:08:52,743 --> 01:08:55,162
But I did find this on the video.

605
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:57,497
Take a look.

606
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:00,500
Take a look.

607
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:04,546
You see that?

608
01:09:05,464 --> 01:09:06,923
I went through it.

609
01:09:07,132 --> 01:09:09,343
Frame by frame

610
01:09:10,761 --> 01:09:12,095
By frame.

611
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:14,890
Oh, my God.

612
01:09:22,731 --> 01:09:24,274
- Who's that?
- I'll get it.

613
01:09:26,276 --> 01:09:27,611
Hi, Lorraine.

614
01:09:28,653 --> 01:09:30,364
Mom, what are you doing here?

615
01:09:30,989 --> 01:09:32,491
I asked your mother to come over.

616
01:09:32,574 --> 01:09:34,868
I called her immediately
after the session.

617
01:09:34,951 --> 01:09:37,829
- Why?
- There's something we must talk about.

618
01:09:38,497 --> 01:09:40,248
Lorraine, have a seat.

619
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:49,424
Go on. Tell him.

620
01:09:51,134 --> 01:09:52,511
Tell me what, Mom?

621
01:09:54,137 --> 01:09:55,472
The reason

622
01:09:56,306 --> 01:10:00,811
I knew to call Elise in this situation,
the reason I know her so well,

623
01:10:02,145 --> 01:10:05,440
is because I called her myself once,
years ago,

624
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,276
to help you.

625
01:10:09,986 --> 01:10:11,154
What are you talking about, Mom?

626
01:10:11,238 --> 01:10:14,574
It's no accident
that your son is a gifted traveler.

627
01:10:15,909 --> 01:10:17,994
The ability was handed down to him.

628
01:10:18,453 --> 01:10:19,538
By his father.

629
01:10:21,123 --> 01:10:22,249
Me?

630
01:10:27,129 --> 01:10:29,172
No, I don't do... I can't do that.

631
01:10:29,256 --> 01:10:33,343
When you were about eight,
you suffered night terrors,

632
01:10:33,427 --> 01:10:37,305
These awful fits of pure fear.

633
01:10:47,858 --> 01:10:52,571
You were terrified of an old woman you
said used to come visit you at night.

634
01:10:57,701 --> 01:11:00,078
I dismissed your stories. I...

635
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:03,248
I told you to grow up.

636
01:11:05,292 --> 01:11:07,544
And then I saw her for myself.

637
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:37,616
At first,
I thought it was a camera problem.

638
01:11:41,703 --> 01:11:43,038
And then I saw her again.

639
01:11:56,092 --> 01:11:57,302
In each photo,

640
01:11:58,929 --> 01:12:00,096
she got closer

641
01:12:04,142 --> 01:12:05,310
and closer

642
01:12:10,524 --> 01:12:12,234
and closer to you.

643
01:12:13,276 --> 01:12:16,112
Finally, I was so frightened,
I found Elise.

644
01:12:16,947 --> 01:12:20,617
Do you remember
any of this, honey, do you?

645
01:12:22,953 --> 01:12:25,997
No. I don't.

646
01:12:26,206 --> 01:12:29,292
Suppressing your memory
and your ability to astral project

647
01:12:29,376 --> 01:12:32,671
was the only way to stop her
from getting into you.

648
01:12:34,214 --> 01:12:36,091
But in the back of your mind,

649
01:12:36,174 --> 01:12:39,886
you're still afraid to have
your picture taken, aren't you?

650
01:12:40,262 --> 01:12:42,931
I kept those photos
hidden from you ever since.

651
01:12:44,182 --> 01:12:46,601
I advised Lorraine to hide them,

652
01:12:47,227 --> 01:12:50,814
to stop taking your picture,
to just let you forget.

653
01:12:53,733 --> 01:12:56,152
- Who is she?
- A parasite.

654
01:12:58,572 --> 01:13:00,865
She befriended your astral body

655
01:13:00,949 --> 01:13:05,245
and then drew you out into the Further,
just as Dalton has been drawn out.

656
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:08,957
I'm so sorry, Josh.

657
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,253
I didn't want to
make you remember all this.

658
01:13:13,336 --> 01:13:15,380
I do it for the sake of your son.

659
01:13:16,923 --> 01:13:18,383
Your son is out there.

660
01:13:19,509 --> 01:13:22,637
And you are the only one
that can bring him back.

661
01:13:22,721 --> 01:13:24,139
And with what we saw tonight,

662
01:13:24,222 --> 01:13:27,058
I would say he doesn't
have much time left to wait for you.

663
01:13:30,687 --> 01:13:31,855
Okay.

664
01:13:39,946 --> 01:13:41,865
You've always been stronger than me.

665
01:13:42,866 --> 01:13:44,492
You can do this.

666
01:13:47,912 --> 01:13:49,873
- I love you.
- I love you.

667
01:13:56,504 --> 01:13:58,131
Please come back.

668
01:14:01,009 --> 01:14:03,386
Remember why you're traveling

669
01:14:04,262 --> 01:14:07,932
and keep one foot in this world.
Do not draw attention to yourself.

670
01:14:08,892 --> 01:14:10,727
If they realize you are not one of them,

671
01:14:11,311 --> 01:14:14,064
they will come for your physical body
in this world.

672
01:14:15,106 --> 01:14:17,233
- Ready?
- Yeah.

673
01:14:18,234 --> 01:14:21,905
I don't know what I'm ready for,
but... Okay.

674
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:34,584
Close your eyes, Josh,
take a deep breath, and relax.

675
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:38,755
With each breath,

676
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:42,425
let the life around you
fade into the background.

677
01:14:43,927 --> 01:14:47,180
Just listen to the ticking
of the metronome.

678
01:14:47,764 --> 01:14:50,767
Focus on the spot
in the center of your forehead.

679
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,938
The universe is deathless.

680
01:14:56,272 --> 01:15:01,277
It is deathless because having
no finite self, it stays infinite.

681
01:15:03,738 --> 01:15:07,909
A sound man, by not advancing himself,

682
01:15:08,243 --> 01:15:11,204
stays the further ahead of himself.

683
01:15:26,803 --> 01:15:29,055
It's useless.
I have no idea what I'm doing.

684
01:15:37,814 --> 01:15:39,983
Now you're outside.

685
01:15:40,859 --> 01:15:43,403
Let my voice be your guide.

686
01:15:44,195 --> 01:15:46,656
Keep a steady stride.

687
01:15:47,490 --> 01:15:50,160
Into the Further you go.

688
01:17:11,574 --> 01:17:12,617
Dalton.

689
01:17:56,119 --> 01:17:57,328
He's in.

690
01:18:07,338 --> 01:18:08,590
Dalton!

691
01:18:18,725 --> 01:18:19,976
Hello?

692
01:18:22,937 --> 01:18:24,105
Hello?

693
01:18:29,819 --> 01:18:30,904
Wait!

694
01:18:46,252 --> 01:18:47,462
Hello?

695
01:19:06,356 --> 01:19:07,565
Hello?

696
01:19:10,693 --> 01:19:11,861
Hello?

697
01:19:16,866 --> 01:19:18,785
I'm looking for my son Dalton.

698
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,043
Dalton!

699
01:20:51,461 --> 01:20:52,670
Dalton!

700
01:21:07,935 --> 01:21:09,479
Where's my son?

701
01:21:11,147 --> 01:21:12,815
Tell me where my son is.

702
01:21:13,191 --> 01:21:14,275
Please.

703
01:22:47,118 --> 01:22:48,494
What's happening to him?

704
01:23:03,509 --> 01:23:04,719
Jesus.

705
01:23:08,598 --> 01:23:10,183
Help him, Elise! Please!

706
01:23:12,268 --> 01:23:13,936
You're stronger than they are, Josh.

707
01:23:15,021 --> 01:23:17,273
You can beat them. You are stronger.
You are the one alive.

708
01:23:18,566 --> 01:23:19,859
Get away from me!

709
01:24:25,424 --> 01:24:27,426
- Dalton!
- Daddy?

710
01:24:27,885 --> 01:24:29,637
- Oh, God! Buddy!
- Daddy!

711
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,430
- Oh, my God! Oh, buddy.
- Daddy.

712
01:24:31,514 --> 01:24:33,224
- Oh, my God.
- Daddy.

713
01:24:33,349 --> 01:24:35,768
Oh, buddy, it's okay.

714
01:24:35,851 --> 01:24:38,104
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. Oh, God.

715
01:24:38,729 --> 01:24:41,524
- Daddy, look. I'm chained.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

716
01:24:41,691 --> 01:24:43,317
Face me, buddy. Face me. Come here.

717
01:24:43,401 --> 01:24:45,820
We'll get you out.
We'll get you out, buddy, okay?

718
01:24:45,903 --> 01:24:48,322
Daddy's here. Daddy's here.

719
01:24:50,658 --> 01:24:52,660
What? What?

720
01:25:26,402 --> 01:25:27,737
Oh, Gad. Okay.

721
01:25:28,237 --> 01:25:30,031
It's okay. Listen to me. Look at me.

722
01:25:30,114 --> 01:25:31,907
None of this is real, okay?
This is not real.

723
01:25:31,991 --> 01:25:33,451
Look at me. Look at my eyes, buddy.

724
01:25:33,534 --> 01:25:35,578
None of this is real.
We're going to go home, okay?

725
01:25:35,661 --> 01:25:36,912
You gotta help me.

726
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:38,748
There's one.

727
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,128
Oh, my God, Dad. He's looking.

728
01:26:10,988 --> 01:26:13,824
Come on, baby. Stay here, baby.
Come on, stay with us.

729
01:26:34,637 --> 01:26:35,846
Daddy!

730
01:26:50,027 --> 01:26:51,404
He's made contact.

731
01:26:53,864 --> 01:26:55,366
Grab the light!

732
01:27:08,295 --> 01:27:09,547
He found your son.

733
01:27:10,506 --> 01:27:11,590
I know it.

734
01:27:11,674 --> 01:27:13,426
Well, then wake them up, for God sake!

735
01:27:13,676 --> 01:27:15,803
I can't. He needs to find us.

736
01:27:30,443 --> 01:27:32,027
I'm scared, Dad.

737
01:27:44,999 --> 01:27:47,460
No! Stop!

738
01:27:58,053 --> 01:28:00,222
Please, Elise, do something!

739
01:28:08,063 --> 01:28:09,732
Renai, you must call out to him.

740
01:28:10,816 --> 01:28:13,569
Josh. Josh. Follow my voice!

741
01:28:14,904 --> 01:28:16,572
Follow my voice, honey.

742
01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:18,657
Get away! Get away!

743
01:28:18,949 --> 01:28:20,034
Come back to us!

744
01:28:20,576 --> 01:28:22,328
Follow my voice, Josh.

745
01:28:22,411 --> 01:28:24,246
Daddy! Listen, I think it's Mommy!

746
01:28:24,330 --> 01:28:27,249
Josh, come back to me. Follow my voice.

747
01:28:27,917 --> 01:28:29,543
Josh, follow my voice.

748
01:28:30,503 --> 01:28:32,379
Follow my voice, Josh.

749
01:28:43,265 --> 01:28:44,683
Follow my voice.

750
01:30:34,293 --> 01:30:36,670
There's something in there! In there!

751
01:30:36,754 --> 01:30:37,921
Elise!

752
01:30:38,547 --> 01:30:40,549
Steven, Lorraine, go check on Dalton.

753
01:30:40,633 --> 01:30:42,593
- What?
- Go check on Dalton.

754
01:30:42,676 --> 01:30:44,803
- What?
- Go check on Dalton now!

755
01:31:34,603 --> 01:31:36,522
They're crossing over into our world.

756
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:54,707
- Elise!
- Tucker!

757
01:31:55,624 --> 01:31:58,252
No, you have to shine the light on Josh.

758
01:32:02,881 --> 01:32:03,966
Come on!

759
01:32:05,592 --> 01:32:06,635
Let's go around back.

760
01:32:06,802 --> 01:32:08,887
Shine the light on Josh! On Josh!

761
01:32:09,346 --> 01:32:10,681
Tucker, on Josh!

762
01:32:10,764 --> 01:32:12,808
- You've got to call him back!
- Josh!

763
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:16,520
Josh! Josh!
Come back to us, Josh, please!

764
01:32:18,731 --> 01:32:20,524
Josh! Josh! Come back, please!

765
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:25,529
Come on, Dad!
Come on, he's right behind us!

766
01:32:25,612 --> 01:32:27,906
- We have to go!
- I'm right behind you! Go!

767
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:37,624
You.

768
01:33:22,544 --> 01:33:23,796
What do you want from me?

769
01:33:24,421 --> 01:33:25,881
What do you want from me?

770
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:28,258
I'm not scared of you.

771
01:33:29,009 --> 01:33:30,677
I'm not scared of you anymore.

772
01:33:30,969 --> 01:33:32,721
You can get away from me.

773
01:33:33,096 --> 01:33:36,725
Get the hell away from me!
Get away from me!

774
01:33:37,851 --> 01:33:39,853
Get away from me!

775
01:33:40,521 --> 01:33:41,605
Leave me alone!

776
01:33:41,814 --> 01:33:43,732
Please, please, please!

777
01:33:43,899 --> 01:33:45,567
Come back to us! Follow my voice!

778
01:33:45,776 --> 01:33:47,569
Follow my voice! Please, honey!

779
01:33:47,736 --> 01:33:49,321
Josh, come back! Come back to us!

780
01:33:49,446 --> 01:33:50,906
Get the hell away from me!

781
01:33:52,741 --> 01:33:55,244
Please, Josh, please,
come back to us, please!

782
01:33:55,410 --> 01:33:58,163
Follow my voice!
Follow my voice! Please!

783
01:33:59,289 --> 01:34:02,751
Josh, please! Come back, please!

784
01:34:03,001 --> 01:34:04,419
Leave me alone!

785
01:34:59,850 --> 01:35:01,560
I've got Dalton. He's awake!

786
01:35:01,643 --> 01:35:02,811
Oh, my boy!

787
01:35:03,478 --> 01:35:05,564
He's okay! He's okay!

788
01:35:06,106 --> 01:35:07,774
We did it, buddy.

789
01:35:16,158 --> 01:35:17,951
You're back. You're back.

790
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:31,465
Dude, I got some amazing shots.

791
01:35:31,548 --> 01:35:34,092
You're gonna write a book,

792
01:35:34,176 --> 01:35:37,512
and my photos
are gonna be the main selling point.

793
01:35:38,013 --> 01:35:40,807
Not the main selling point,
but they'll definitely be important.

794
01:35:40,891 --> 01:35:42,184
They will be important.

795
01:35:43,143 --> 01:35:44,770
A picture's worth a thousand words.

796
01:35:44,853 --> 01:35:47,856
Yeah, but words
are worth a thousand words, too.

797
01:35:51,193 --> 01:35:52,986
You're really hungry, aren't you?

798
01:35:53,654 --> 01:35:55,165
And I'm tired, too.

799
01:35:55,712 --> 01:35:57,013
You're tired?

800
01:35:57,532 --> 01:35:59,534
- No, you can't be tired.
- Yes, I can.

801
01:35:59,618 --> 01:36:01,745
No, you've been asleep for far too long.
And you know what?

802
01:36:01,828 --> 01:36:03,080
I'm never letting you go to sleep again.

803
01:36:05,582 --> 01:36:07,209
You showed me a new world.

804
01:36:08,210 --> 01:36:09,628
No, I didn't.

805
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:12,589
You've been there before, remember?

806
01:36:17,052 --> 01:36:19,096
Well, let's hope I forget again.

807
01:36:20,263 --> 01:36:22,724
Guess I don't need these anymore.

808
01:36:29,523 --> 01:36:30,649
What?

809
01:36:31,066 --> 01:36:32,275
Nothing.

810
01:36:32,943 --> 01:36:35,070
I'm gonna get rid of these.

811
01:36:35,737 --> 01:36:36,947
All right.

812
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:53,171
Why did you do that?

813
01:36:54,381 --> 01:36:57,676
Why would you do that to me
when you know how I feel about that?

814
01:36:57,759 --> 01:36:59,511
Why? Why?

815
01:37:00,262 --> 01:37:01,930
Why? Why?

816
01:37:02,014 --> 01:37:04,182
Why? Why? Why?

817
01:37:04,266 --> 01:37:05,434
No, you're not tired.

818
01:37:05,517 --> 01:37:07,894
In fact, you're never going to
sleep again. You have to stay awake

819
01:37:07,978 --> 01:37:09,312
- for the rest of your life, with me.
- No.

820
01:37:10,731 --> 01:37:12,592
Why? Why? Why?

821
01:37:19,781 --> 01:37:21,425
You bitch!

822
01:37:26,621 --> 01:37:28,957
- Can you watch him, Lorraine?
- Sure.

823
01:37:33,128 --> 01:37:34,379
Elise.

824
01:37:42,888 --> 01:37:45,474
Josh! Josh!

825
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:48,896
Josh, where are you?

826
01:37:50,134 --> 01:37:51,207
Josh!

827
01:37:53,148 --> 01:37:54,983
Honey, please... Josh!

828
01:37:59,654 --> 01:38:00,906
Josh?

829
01:38:03,992 --> 01:38:05,494
Oh, Jesus.

830
01:38:32,187 --> 01:38:33,345
Renai,

831
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:34,957
I'm right here.
