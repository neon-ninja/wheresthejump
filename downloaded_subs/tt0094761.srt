1
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:44,297
That's a first down.
Husky ball at the 35-yard line.

2
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:54,598
Hut!

3
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:06,901
Touchdown! Paul Taylor.
17-yard pass from Terry Stokes.

4
00:04:18,453 --> 00:04:22,290
Paul, look at her, man. Look at her!
I think she wants your body.

5
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:24,625
You got to ask her out, Paul.

6
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,377
Isn't she dating Pulver?

7
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,713
Yeah, but that's going nowhere.
Take a shot, for Christ's sake.

8
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:31,965
Hey, I'm going to ask her out.

9
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:33,050
Bullshit!

10
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,926
When, when, when?

11
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,262
- When the time is right.
- Yeah, right.

12
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,805
Timing's everything.

13
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:46,228
Hit him! Hit him!

14
00:04:48,063 --> 00:04:50,190
Yeah! All right!

15
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:51,775
Wildcat fumble.

16
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,236
Husky ball. First and ten.

17
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:20,385
7-yard pass complete to Paul Taylor.

18
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:31,728
Meg, you have any plans this evening?

19
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:35,704
Go!

20
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:37,455
Go!

21
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:39,874
Go!

22
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:39,220
Looks like the game
put you out of business.

23
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:41,931
Don't worry.
When they're through screaming...

24
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:43,891
...they'll be in here like a flood.

25
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:45,393
More iced tea?

26
00:07:45,476 --> 00:07:46,727
Please.

27
00:07:47,102 --> 00:07:50,814
It's good that this town's got up
on its hindlegs about something.

28
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,234
It takes people's minds off their troubles.

29
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:56,903
It's been a lean year for most folk.

30
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:01,908
The ski season is about to start.
There will be tourists.

31
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:09,581
You know, there's a new band
out at the Tin Palace tonight.

32
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:11,583
Is that right?

33
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,293
Supposed to be pretty good.

34
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:14,878
That's nice.

35
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,131
You like country music?

36
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:24,428
Herb, are you asking me out?

37
00:08:25,763 --> 00:08:29,058
Yeah, well, I guess I am.

38
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:32,936
I don't know.

39
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,438
I'm kind of stuck here.

40
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:38,566
You know, I've got to earn a living.

41
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:42,487
Yeah, it must be tough trying to get away.

42
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,698
Shoot!

43
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:48,951
George, here they come.

44
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:56,041
Is that my check?

45
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:02,922
If you do get any free time to yourself...

46
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:05,591
...that's my number there
down at the station.

47
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,178
Okay.

48
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:12,597
Okay. One at a time.

49
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,218
Flagg. Congratulations.

50
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,595
For what?

51
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,098
I hear you have a birthday coming up.

52
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,141
No more juvie hall, right?

53
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,642
Yeah, right.

54
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,854
You mess up now and you're in the majors.

55
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:09,066
I'll see you around, Flagg.

56
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,836
Moss, what's happening?

57
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:33,130
You look like hell.

58
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:35,924
It's a fashion statement, man.

59
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:39,969
The only statement those clothes
have got to make is, "I look like hell."

60
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,140
My bike's broken down at Elkin's Grove.
I was thinking...

61
00:10:44,348 --> 00:10:47,101
...maybe I could borrow your ratchet set?

62
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:52,189
The Summit's got me overhauling
six damn Skidoos, three Cats...

63
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:54,816
...and two flatbed snowmakers, by Monday.

64
00:10:56,109 --> 00:10:59,112
What's the hurry?
It must be 70 degrees out there.

65
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,531
It's Indian summer, boy.

66
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,869
Very soon winter will be tear-arseing
through this town...

67
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:08,203
...with no apologies.

68
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:11,039
Come on. It barely pissed snow
the last couple of years.

69
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:13,500
This whole town's ready to fold.

70
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,835
This year's going to be different.

71
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,961
Is that right?

72
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:18,713
Take my word.

73
00:11:18,796 --> 00:11:21,549
You'll wish your piece of shit excuse
for a motorcycle...

74
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:23,718
...was one of these sweet little rigs.

75
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:28,931
So how about the ratchet?

76
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:34,561
All right. Maybe I'll put in
a couple of hours over the weekend.

77
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:37,063
Maybe that'll lighten things up a bit.

78
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:42,110
There are twelve sockets in that set.

79
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,694
Twelve.

80
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:46,405
They better all be there when I get it back.

81
00:11:46,614 --> 00:11:48,949
You got it, buddy. You got it.

82
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:52,327
Thanks a lot, Moss.

83
00:11:52,994 --> 00:11:54,371
I owe you one.

84
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:56,498
You owe me too damn many.

85
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:44,208
Holy cow!

86
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:03,684
Lend me $5 just until tomorrow, okay?

87
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:04,685
What for?

88
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,730
You know, you're not the only one
with a date tonight.

89
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:11,525
I'm going to score with Vicki tonight.
I want to invest in some protection.

90
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:13,193
Let's go. It's closing time.

91
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:14,945
All right, here.

92
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:16,988
Make it quick.

93
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:23,369
Look, pal. Give me a pack of Trojans,
and a Binaca spray.

94
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:34,796
Scott Jeskey.

95
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:35,880
Reverend.

96
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:37,632
Good game today.

97
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:41,302
Thanks. Thanks, Reverend.

98
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:46,390
How are you?

99
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:50,394
The hay fever's acting up a little bit,
but I'll live.

100
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,564
Haven't seen you
at the Sunday services lately.

101
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:57,692
You want the ribbed, or the regular?

102
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,738
Ribbed, I guess.

103
00:14:04,115 --> 00:14:06,158
They're not for me, you know.

104
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:08,285
They're for my friend.

105
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:14,374
There's this sort of naive girl
that he's planning on...

106
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,584
Well, you know.

107
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:20,380
I insisted that he take precautions.

108
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:23,174
Why doesn't he pay for them?

109
00:14:23,507 --> 00:14:27,636
I had to drag him down here as it is.
The guy is totally irresponsible.

110
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,596
Come on, Scott. What's the hold up?

111
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,557
I can't keep this girl waiting.

112
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:35,560
The boy doesn't need condoms.
He needs a muzzle.

113
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:23,492
Kevin! Don't eat with your face.

114
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:26,453
Mum, we're in a hurry.
We're going bowling with Anthony.

115
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,455
And then to the movies.

116
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:30,374
What movie?

117
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:33,251
Garden Tool Massacre.
It's your basic slice-and-dice.

118
00:16:33,377 --> 00:16:34,503
Your basic what?

119
00:16:34,586 --> 00:16:38,131
This guy in a hockey mask,
he chops up a few teenagers.

120
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,426
But don't worry,
there's no sex or anything bad.

121
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:43,761
They won't let you kids
into a movie like that.

122
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,555
No problem. My brother's an usher.

123
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:49,725
No. Absolutely not.

124
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:51,643
Mum, come on!

125
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:55,689
Kevin! I will not have you seeing
that kind of trash, and that's final.

126
00:16:55,772 --> 00:16:57,107
Do you understand?

127
00:16:57,565 --> 00:16:58,858
Yes, ma'am.

128
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:01,527
Mum, have you seen my pink sweater?

129
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:03,696
It's on the hamper, honey.

130
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,198
I meant to talk to you about that.

131
00:17:06,782 --> 00:17:08,617
- Why did you do that?
- What did I do?

132
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:11,161
We had a little accident.

133
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:15,665
What happened?

134
00:17:15,749 --> 00:17:17,709
It got mixed up in the wash.

135
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:19,586
Interesting look.

136
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:21,629
Why don't you wear
my cashmere sweater?

137
00:17:21,712 --> 00:17:24,048
- Are you serious?
- Sure.

138
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:26,509
Oh, my God! That's him.

139
00:17:31,305 --> 00:17:32,431
What do you want?

140
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:34,850
Hi. I'm here to see Meg.

141
00:17:35,642 --> 00:17:36,976
What for?

142
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:39,646
Just to see her.

143
00:17:39,812 --> 00:17:42,190
- ls she home?
- Just a minute.

144
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:50,781
I'm terribly sorry.

145
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:52,991
You must be Paul. I'm Meg's mother.

146
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:54,284
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

147
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:57,245
Come on in. Meg will be right down.

148
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:02,125
Where are you going?

149
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,543
- I'm sleeping over at Eddie's, remember?
- Right.

150
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:07,546
But you're not going anywhere
without your jacket.

151
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,339
Mum, it's boiling out.

152
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:13,009
It's October. It's night-time.
You're wearing your jacket.

153
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,055
- Stupid coat.
- No, here, let me.

154
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,974
Bye, honey. Enjoy yourself.

155
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:20,933
Bye, Mum.

156
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,226
Bye, Eddie.

157
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,644
Oh, yeah.

158
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,606
Won't you sit down?

159
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,150
Excuse me.

160
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,321
Hi, Paul.

161
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,657
Are you surviving my family so far?

162
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,243
- Yeah. You look great.
- Thank you.

163
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:41,369
You want to go?

164
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:44,330
I just want you to meet my dad.
It'll just take a second.

165
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:45,581
Sure.

166
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:53,422
Daddy, I'd like you to meet my friend, Paul.

167
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:00,887
Ribbed.

168
00:20:13,203 --> 00:20:14,496
Hey!

169
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:25,089
I'm really sorry about my dad.
I've never seen him like that before.

170
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:26,674
That's okay.

171
00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:29,551
It was just a misunderstanding.

172
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:35,056
I've made better first impressions.
That's for sure.

173
00:20:35,557 --> 00:20:37,434
No harm done, I guess.

174
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:38,601
No, wrong.

175
00:20:39,185 --> 00:20:41,312
Scott Jeskey is going to die.

176
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:48,485
Paul, watch out!

177
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:56,159
Flagg! Jesus Christ.
What did you do to him?

178
00:20:56,242 --> 00:20:58,620
I'm not the one
who bounced him off my car, pal!

179
00:20:58,703 --> 00:21:01,873
- You ran him into the road!
- Stop it! Let's get him to a doctor.

180
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:05,042
Watch out. He's got some kind of
corrosive shit on his hands.

181
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:11,215
Come on. Take it easy, mister.
We'll get you some help. All right?

182
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:21,641
The sky. It fell from the sky.

183
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:22,934
What's he saying?

184
00:21:23,017 --> 00:21:25,311
He's in shock. Let's just go.

185
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:29,023
Get in the car.

186
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:32,234
What for?

187
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:35,403
There'll be a lot of explaining to do,
and you're part of it.

188
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:39,407
Are you going to get in the car,
or am I going to make you get in?

189
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:44,328
What's the matter? You worried
about a little insurance claim...

190
00:21:44,453 --> 00:21:46,288
...on Daddy's car?

191
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:48,832
Maybe I will come along...

192
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:51,543
...just to make sure
you don't blame it all on me.

193
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:53,920
Are you two finished?

194
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:09,351
Whenever you're ready.

195
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:22,613
- Excuse me, nurse.
- One moment, please.

196
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:35,458
How may I help you?

197
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,419
We've had a car accident.
This guy needs a doctor.

198
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:41,881
He has something on his hand, too.
Some kind of acid or something.

199
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:45,301
Does he have Blue Cross?

200
00:22:45,593 --> 00:22:48,137
- I don't know.
- Medical insurance of any kind?

201
00:22:48,262 --> 00:22:49,763
I don't believe this shit.

202
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:52,307
We don't even know who the guy is.

203
00:22:53,392 --> 00:22:55,977
The doctor's with another patient
right now.

204
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,150
Could you put this gentleman
in Room 3, please?

205
00:23:03,985 --> 00:23:05,986
You'll have to fill these out.

206
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,112
Okay.

207
00:23:12,951 --> 00:23:15,370
Take it easy, old dude.

208
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:18,289
These guys are going to fix you right up.

209
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,342
Where are you going?

210
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:33,637
These people don't give a shit
about explanations.

211
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:37,015
If you need me,
you know where to find me.

212
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,164
I bet you've had better first dates.

213
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:05,458
I don't mind.

214
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:09,044
You want a soda?

215
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,631
That would be great. Something diet.

216
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:42,783
Absolutely. At this point
the prognosis is very positive.

217
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:48,747
In cases like this, the question is always
the quality of physical therapy.

218
00:24:50,082 --> 00:24:53,668
The follow-up to any operation is
to a great extent...

219
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,184
Doctor, come in here quickly!

220
00:25:10,434 --> 00:25:13,895
- I'm with a patient...
- There's a man dying in here! Hurry!

221
00:25:15,563 --> 00:25:17,357
Excuse me a moment.

222
00:25:24,196 --> 00:25:26,240
Is this the hand injury?

223
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,461
What is this?

224
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:42,755
That thing on his hand.

225
00:25:47,218 --> 00:25:48,218
Nurse!

226
00:25:58,436 --> 00:26:01,564
- Sheriff's Department.
- Get me the Sheriff! It's an emergency.

227
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:05,609
Paul?

228
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:15,327
Geller speaking.

229
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,078
Sheriff, this is Paul Taylor.

230
00:26:17,162 --> 00:26:18,496
Paul, what's wrong?

231
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:22,166
I'm at the Arborville Hospital.
An old man's just been killed down here.

232
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,251
- You said "killed"?
- Yes, sir.

233
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,338
You sit tight. I'll be right down.
Who else is involved?

234
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:28,797
I'm with Meg Penny.

235
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:31,341
- And Brian Flagg was here earlier.
- Flagg?

236
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,093
Where is he now?

237
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,352
Paul?

238
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,860
Paul!

239
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:23,556
I did see it, Dad. It killed Paul.

240
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:25,599
Sheriff.

241
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,143
How about it, Herb?
Can we take her home?

242
00:27:28,268 --> 00:27:30,145
You may as well, Tom.

243
00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:32,564
Make sure she gets a good sleep.

244
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:38,778
We're not going to get anything
out of her tonight. She's hysterical.

245
00:27:39,112 --> 00:27:42,281
I have to call Paul Taylor's folks.
They haven't heard from him.

246
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,535
Let's face it, Bill. They're not going to.

247
00:27:49,246 --> 00:27:52,958
You get that to Sacramento tonight.
And I want the autopsy pronto...

248
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,793
...not next week.

249
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,428
Jesus wept!

250
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,805
Herb, you okay?

251
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:10,766
Taylor was a good kid.

252
00:28:13,935 --> 00:28:16,521
I want the son of a bitch who did this.

253
00:28:24,695 --> 00:28:26,780
I think we've already got him.

254
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:50,344
Scott! Cut it out. I told you.

255
00:28:50,802 --> 00:28:54,055
Come on, Vicki. You're wearing my ring.

256
00:28:54,472 --> 00:28:57,809
That makes you my girl.
Doesn't that count for something?

257
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:06,317
What are all those lights down there?
Isn't that the hospital?

258
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:09,278
It's probably a promotional gimmick.

259
00:29:09,653 --> 00:29:11,780
They're giving away free tonsillectomies.

260
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:16,618
I think that you're about ready
for another one of my famous...

261
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:18,912
- ...cherry coolers.
- I think I've had enough.

262
00:29:18,995 --> 00:29:21,247
Nonsense. You've never had enough.

263
00:29:33,717 --> 00:29:37,345
My very own blend
of special imported liquors.

264
00:30:30,602 --> 00:30:31,645
Okay.

265
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,150
It's like a steam bath in here.
Here's your drink, Vicki.

266
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,792
Hot as a dog out there tonight.

267
00:31:05,134 --> 00:31:06,260
That's a...

268
00:31:08,554 --> 00:31:10,764
That's a nice blouse.

269
00:31:14,935 --> 00:31:16,436
Nice material.

270
00:31:17,604 --> 00:31:19,480
It must be hot, though.

271
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:24,985
I'll just undo one of these for you.

272
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:27,529
That's better, huh?

273
00:31:28,572 --> 00:31:29,990
Oh, no?

274
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,867
Oh, well.

275
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:33,243
I'll just...

276
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:35,954
...undo another one then.

277
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,042
Okay.

278
00:32:01,477 --> 00:32:02,979
Oh God, Vicki!

279
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:04,855
No!

280
00:32:29,086 --> 00:32:31,922
I shouldn't have let her
go out with the son of a bitch...

281
00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:33,381
...in the first place.

282
00:32:33,507 --> 00:32:36,801
Lower your voice.
That poor boy's probably dead.

283
00:32:38,553 --> 00:32:40,763
I want to know
what happened out there tonight.

284
00:32:40,847 --> 00:32:43,307
Whatever it was
that Flagg kid was behind it.

285
00:32:43,432 --> 00:32:45,976
It's about time they nailed
that little psychopath.

286
00:32:46,143 --> 00:32:49,605
His arse is going to fry this time.
Believe me.

287
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:10,207
Here, take this.

288
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,458
I don't want it.

289
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,960
Come on, honey.
You have to get some sleep.

290
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:23,803
That's my good girl.

291
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:29,391
Now, just let it alone.

292
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:34,271
I'm sure the police will have
this whole thing settled by the morning.

293
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,483
Come on.

294
00:33:53,246 --> 00:33:54,372
Mum?

295
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:02,338
You don't believe me either, do you?

296
00:34:04,673 --> 00:34:06,258
You're home now.

297
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,052
You're safe.

298
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,722
That's all that matters.

299
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:19,117
Look at him. He's too stupid
to know how much trouble he's in.

300
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,161
Why don't you wise up?

301
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,915
I told you everything.
I'm getting tired of hearing myself talk.

302
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,584
We're not boring you, are we?
A bright kid like you?

303
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,419
Am I under arrest?

304
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:32,462
Because if I am, I want a lawyer.

305
00:35:32,671 --> 00:35:34,047
Now he wants a lawyer.

306
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,759
That's right. If you're not booking me,
I'd like to leave.

307
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:40,136
Either way, I want you out of my face.

308
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:41,679
Oh yeah, hard-arse?

309
00:35:41,888 --> 00:35:44,807
I'm in your face to stay.
What are you going to do about it?

310
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:48,727
Go ahead, hit me!

311
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:51,647
Go ahead.

312
00:36:01,614 --> 00:36:04,075
Any luck with his mama?

313
00:36:04,158 --> 00:36:05,826
I can't seem to find her.

314
00:36:05,951 --> 00:36:07,494
That's not unusual, is it?

315
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:10,080
She takes vacations
with Johnnie Walker Red...

316
00:36:10,164 --> 00:36:12,582
...and anyone else
who happens to be around.

317
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:15,585
We could call his dad,
if anyone knew who he was.

318
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:17,962
Call a shrink. I'm a broken man.

319
00:36:18,213 --> 00:36:20,298
You think this is a joke?

320
00:36:30,474 --> 00:36:32,059
Turn him loose.

321
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:35,770
We got eyewitnesses
placing him at the crime scene.

322
00:36:35,854 --> 00:36:40,316
We got no motive. No evidence.
He hasn't got a drop of blood on him.

323
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,945
- Flagg's a punk. But he's no killer.
- I think it's a mistake.

324
00:36:45,029 --> 00:36:49,783
Your objection is duly noted.
Now turn him loose. We got work to do.

325
00:36:51,952 --> 00:36:53,161
Go on.

326
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:01,335
Take a hike.

327
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,015
Brian! I need to talk to you.

328
00:37:22,688 --> 00:37:24,732
What the hell are you doing here?

329
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:27,568
Look, I came down to bail you out.

330
00:37:30,487 --> 00:37:32,656
What do you think they are,
Neiman-Marcus?

331
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:34,032
They don't take plastic.

332
00:37:34,324 --> 00:37:37,327
Look, I appreciate the thought.
Now, go home, okay?

333
00:37:38,453 --> 00:37:40,371
I need to talk to you.

334
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:44,333
I'm sorry about your boyfriend. I really am.

335
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:49,546
I'm tired and hungry, and I'm not
in the mood for conversation, okay?

336
00:37:59,806 --> 00:38:02,266
George. Frannie. Que pasa?

337
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,602
Hey, hotshot, we're closed.

338
00:38:04,935 --> 00:38:08,731
Come on. I've been dumped on all day.
Give me a break.

339
00:38:08,814 --> 00:38:12,150
What's the matter, dear,
tough day at the office?

340
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,654
Well, grill's shut down.
How about a sandwich?

341
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,197
Beautiful.

342
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:32,836
You don't give up, do you?

343
00:38:34,421 --> 00:38:35,839
I need your help.

344
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:38,967
For three years in school
you haven't said shit to me.

345
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:43,262
All of a sudden you need my help
and we're best friends, right?

346
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:47,308
Nobody believes me
about what happened tonight.

347
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:49,768
What did happen?

348
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:51,770
You were there. You saw.

349
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:55,774
All I saw was an old man
with a funky hand. That's all I saw.

350
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,611
Thanks.

351
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:01,529
Can I get you something, hon?

352
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:03,030
No, thank you.

353
00:39:09,745 --> 00:39:14,749
The thing on that man's hand killed him
and then it killed Paul.

354
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:18,545
And whatever it is, it's getting bigger.

355
00:39:19,045 --> 00:39:21,422
Is that what you told the cops?

356
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:32,265
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

357
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:36,269
I know you're the homecoming queen type
and all, but...

358
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,647
...are you strung out on something,
or what?

359
00:39:42,441 --> 00:39:44,026
You're just the same.

360
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:47,738
What are you talking about?

361
00:39:47,905 --> 00:39:51,575
You act like you're different.
You put on this big show.

362
00:39:51,992 --> 00:39:56,079
But you're just like everyone else
in this town. You're full of shit, Flagg!

363
00:39:57,247 --> 00:39:58,706
Wait a second!

364
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:04,837
Calm down, all right? I'm sorry, okay?

365
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:08,757
Come on, sit down.

366
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:18,474
You okay?

367
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:23,980
You want something to eat?

368
00:40:24,397 --> 00:40:27,232
Here. Go ahead, it'll make you feel better.

369
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,194
Unbelievable.

370
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:35,615
It's just that I've never heard
you say "shit" before.

371
00:40:35,782 --> 00:40:37,367
What was that like for you?

372
00:40:49,628 --> 00:40:52,589
We're coming up empty here.
Should we head to the foothills?

373
00:40:52,672 --> 00:40:55,425
Negative.
I'd rather have you patrolling the streets.

374
00:40:55,508 --> 00:40:58,636
We'll start that at first light,
when the state police come in.

375
00:40:58,761 --> 00:40:59,846
Ten-four.

376
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:01,514
You look exhausted.

377
00:41:01,597 --> 00:41:04,058
It's been a long night. Thank you.

378
00:41:04,141 --> 00:41:06,268
It's going to be even longer.

379
00:41:07,102 --> 00:41:09,563
That's the truth.

380
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,192
One deputy and six volunteers.
I feel like the one-legged man...

381
00:41:14,317 --> 00:41:16,403
...in an arse-kicking contest.

382
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,532
You're doing all you can, Herb.
This isn't your normal, Friday night drunk.

383
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:23,326
Something wrong?

384
00:41:24,452 --> 00:41:26,829
I'm just worried about a friend of mine.

385
00:41:28,205 --> 00:41:31,792
I guess I'm worried
about everybody tonight.

386
00:41:36,463 --> 00:41:37,505
Dessert.

387
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:40,967
Fran. That sandwich busted me.

388
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:45,638
On the house. Last two pieces.
Eat up, or I chuck it in the garbage.

389
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,681
Thanks.

390
00:42:10,035 --> 00:42:11,411
Shit.

391
00:42:22,713 --> 00:42:24,423
Here. I'll get that.

392
00:42:25,216 --> 00:42:26,508
I'll get it.

393
00:42:26,634 --> 00:42:29,136
- Here. Knock yourself out.
- Well, thanks.

394
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,678
What is this?

395
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,241
Don't touch him!

396
00:43:54,589 --> 00:43:56,299
Fran, come on!

397
00:44:02,054 --> 00:44:03,639
In the freezer!

398
00:45:01,818 --> 00:45:03,361
Hear anything?

399
00:45:07,406 --> 00:45:08,741
I'm okay.

400
00:45:16,331 --> 00:45:19,542
I'm going to get us out of here. I promise.

401
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,555
Come on, answer!

402
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,686
Your call can not be completed as dialled.

403
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:43,606
Please check the number, and dial again.

404
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:05,376
- Sheriff's Station.
- Help me!

405
00:46:05,459 --> 00:46:07,461
Get me Herb. Get Herb Geller.

406
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:09,713
He went down to the diner.

407
00:46:30,065 --> 00:46:31,441
You ready?

408
00:46:47,248 --> 00:46:48,248
Okay.

409
00:47:15,857 --> 00:47:19,152
Great. I killed the strawberry jam.

410
00:47:21,988 --> 00:47:23,572
Let's get out of here.

411
00:47:23,656 --> 00:47:25,741
The front door is locked.

412
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,579
That's okay. I got a key.

413
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,199
Merciful God.

414
00:48:36,848 --> 00:48:37,932
Hello?

415
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:41,018
Is anybody...

416
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:43,145
...hurt?

417
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:52,167
We need to see the Sheriff!

418
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,919
I don't know where he is.

419
00:49:54,002 --> 00:49:56,212
Sheriff's Department. Please hold.

420
00:49:56,504 --> 00:49:57,797
What about Briggs?

421
00:49:57,881 --> 00:50:00,633
I can't raise anybody.
All I'm getting is static.

422
00:50:00,967 --> 00:50:03,552
Sheriff's Department. Please hold.

423
00:50:03,636 --> 00:50:07,139
The last I heard from the Deputy,
he was on his way up to Elkin's Grove.

424
00:50:07,723 --> 00:50:09,391
Elkin's Grove.

425
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,061
That's where I found the old man.
Come on, let's go.

426
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,503
It looks like he left in a hurry.

427
00:50:49,636 --> 00:50:52,097
He's got to be around here somewhere.

428
00:50:52,389 --> 00:50:54,057
In the woods.

429
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,976
In the dark woods.

430
00:50:57,477 --> 00:50:59,896
Right. We could wait here.

431
00:51:07,152 --> 00:51:10,489
I never thought I'd go out of my way
to find a cop.

432
00:51:21,207 --> 00:51:22,416
Hello!

433
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:28,881
I feel like fucking Hansel and Gretel here.
We should have brought bread crumbs.

434
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:33,009
Wait.

435
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:35,220
I think I hear something.

436
00:51:42,018 --> 00:51:43,936
What the hell is that?

437
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,378
Put those weapons down.

438
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,634
We're here to help you.

439
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,261
- Name?
- Meg Penny.

440
00:52:20,344 --> 00:52:22,888
- Are you a resident of Arborville, Meg?
- Yes, I am.

441
00:52:22,972 --> 00:52:25,724
Have you experienced any vomiting,
nausea or diarrhoea?

442
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:27,142
Back off!

443
00:52:27,226 --> 00:52:30,687
Hey, pal. You want to fill us in?
Who the hell are you people?

444
00:52:30,812 --> 00:52:35,483
I'm Dr. Meddows. We're a government
sanctioned, biological containment team.

445
00:52:35,608 --> 00:52:37,527
"Biological containment?"

446
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:39,487
We're microbe hunters, young lady.

447
00:52:39,612 --> 00:52:40,863
Flagg?

448
00:52:42,448 --> 00:52:44,742
What are you doing here, boy?

449
00:52:45,701 --> 00:52:49,371
The men from Glad here are showing us
how to keep our leftovers fresh.

450
00:52:49,496 --> 00:52:53,083
They're here on business.
They don't have time for bullshit. Okay?

451
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,752
Colonel, has the Deputy been briefed
in detail?

452
00:52:55,835 --> 00:52:56,628
Yes, sir.

453
00:52:56,711 --> 00:52:58,546
I'm heading to town now to get started.

454
00:52:59,005 --> 00:53:01,299
Splendid.
Colonel Hargis will arrange an escort.

455
00:53:02,341 --> 00:53:04,260
What is going on over there?

456
00:53:05,469 --> 00:53:10,098
That's the source of our worries.
A troublesome souvenir from space.

457
00:53:10,307 --> 00:53:11,892
- What?
- A meteorite.

458
00:53:12,768 --> 00:53:14,102
Don't get too close.

459
00:53:14,186 --> 00:53:16,271
There's danger of contamination.

460
00:53:16,438 --> 00:53:18,231
I don't understand.

461
00:53:18,523 --> 00:53:20,566
Let me tell you a story.

462
00:53:21,025 --> 00:53:24,779
The dinosaurs ruled our planet
for millions of years...

463
00:53:25,488 --> 00:53:28,532
...and yet they died out almost overnight.

464
00:53:28,824 --> 00:53:29,950
Why?

465
00:53:30,617 --> 00:53:32,285
The evidence suggests...

466
00:53:32,536 --> 00:53:35,872
...that a meteor fell to earth bearing
an alien bacteria.

467
00:53:36,289 --> 00:53:39,459
Plague? Is that what this is all about?

468
00:53:39,792 --> 00:53:40,918
Prevention.

469
00:53:41,002 --> 00:53:45,005
And you think this meteor brought
some kind of a killer germ?

470
00:53:45,464 --> 00:53:49,760
It's something I've expected
and prepared for, all my life.

471
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:54,556
Your meteor brought something all right.
But if it's a germ...

472
00:53:54,973 --> 00:53:57,851
...it's the biggest son of a bitch
you've ever seen.

473
00:54:09,236 --> 00:54:10,612
What's the matter?

474
00:54:10,696 --> 00:54:13,448
Isn't it awfully late
to be trimming the hedges?

475
00:54:13,532 --> 00:54:15,950
Maybe this guy's a peeping Tom
or something.

476
00:54:16,117 --> 00:54:18,995
So, let's give him something to peep at.

477
00:54:26,835 --> 00:54:30,672
Wait a minute.
Hockey season ended months ago.

478
00:54:33,884 --> 00:54:37,804
He's going to get the camp counsellor
with the hedge trimmer.

479
00:54:43,225 --> 00:54:45,060
But the girl gets away.

480
00:54:47,229 --> 00:54:51,733
She's going to run into the lodge and hide,
but he's going to get her anyway.

481
00:54:52,734 --> 00:54:53,902
Please be quiet.

482
00:54:54,444 --> 00:54:55,612
You shut up!

483
00:54:56,529 --> 00:54:57,655
Hey!

484
00:54:57,822 --> 00:54:59,907
You've got to shut up. If you get caught...

485
00:54:59,991 --> 00:55:02,660
...your mum'll kill me.
Get your feet off the seat!

486
00:55:02,743 --> 00:55:04,453
Anthony, come on.

487
00:55:06,413 --> 00:55:07,581
Jerk.

488
00:55:08,207 --> 00:55:09,583
What a wimp!

489
00:55:10,959 --> 00:55:13,086
Check out the body on the blonde.

490
00:55:49,077 --> 00:55:50,454
Wonderful.

491
00:55:55,667 --> 00:55:56,584
Yeah?

492
00:55:56,668 --> 00:55:59,796
It's Hobbs. It's boiling up here.
Is the air conditioning on?

493
00:55:59,879 --> 00:56:01,464
It's on full blast.

494
00:56:01,547 --> 00:56:03,549
It must be blocked up or something.

495
00:56:03,633 --> 00:56:05,551
There's nothing wrong with it.

496
00:56:05,634 --> 00:56:08,220
Come up and see for yourself.

497
00:56:46,046 --> 00:56:48,048
Hobbs, are you in here?

498
00:57:07,733 --> 00:57:09,234
I can't begin to thank you both.

499
00:57:09,318 --> 00:57:12,279
This information is incredibly valuable.

500
00:57:12,571 --> 00:57:14,155
Please, get in.

501
00:57:14,614 --> 00:57:16,574
- Where are we going?
- Back to town.

502
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:20,203
Arborville is under quarantine
until we've isolated that organism...

503
00:57:20,286 --> 00:57:23,205
...and checked every living soul
for signs of infection.

504
00:57:23,331 --> 00:57:26,917
- ln the meantime, we're your prisoners.
- Not at all. You're my patients.

505
00:57:27,293 --> 00:57:29,294
Sounds like the same thing to me.

506
00:57:30,295 --> 00:57:33,465
Young man, please, step into the van.

507
00:57:35,967 --> 00:57:40,096
Thanks for the offer, Doc. But my bike's
back there and we can make it back...

508
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:41,597
...on our own.

509
00:57:41,681 --> 00:57:44,850
By the way, I love your tailor.
I got to get me one of those.

510
00:57:48,353 --> 00:57:49,771
Get in the van.

511
00:57:54,484 --> 00:57:56,694
Van ride sounds nice.

512
00:58:03,534 --> 00:58:04,744
Clear.

513
00:58:18,881 --> 00:58:20,758
- lt's locked.
- So what?

514
00:58:21,551 --> 00:58:25,096
Brian, what is with you?
You're acting like a complete jerk.

515
00:58:25,513 --> 00:58:28,223
I have a problem with authority figures.

516
00:58:28,348 --> 00:58:29,600
What are you doing?

517
00:58:29,683 --> 00:58:33,103
We ought to get out of here.
Take my bike and blow this town.

518
00:58:33,228 --> 00:58:35,772
It's getting thick around here,
don't you think?

519
00:58:35,855 --> 00:58:39,150
That's crazy.
These people are here to help us.

520
00:58:39,984 --> 00:58:43,070
Come on, Meg.
We don't even know who they are.

521
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:45,197
NASA? CIA?

522
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:47,491
The Royal Canadian Mounties?

523
00:58:47,574 --> 00:58:50,535
All I know is I saw a bunch
of unmarked trucks.

524
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:52,579
I think this whole thing stinks.

525
00:58:52,704 --> 00:58:54,956
Well, we can't just run out.

526
00:58:55,915 --> 00:59:00,169
Let's just think of it
as looking out for our best interests.

527
00:59:03,923 --> 00:59:05,341
You coming?

528
00:59:06,425 --> 00:59:10,220
Brian, I have to go back.
My family's there, people that I care about.

529
00:59:10,387 --> 00:59:13,473
I'm going.
If you're smart, you'll come with me.

530
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:20,480
Then go. Take care of yourself.
That's the only thing you're really good at.

531
00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:24,442
No one else ever volunteered for the job.

532
00:59:34,284 --> 00:59:37,203
Christ, Flagg. A cheerleader.

533
01:00:01,225 --> 01:00:02,476
Come on, ma'am.

534
01:00:02,643 --> 01:00:07,648
There is no cause for alarm.
I repeat, there is no cause for alarm.

535
01:00:07,731 --> 01:00:12,611
This is a precautionary quarantine,
due to a potential biological hazard.

536
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:16,573
Please proceed toward Town Hall
in an orderly fashion.

537
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:18,825
Mum! Dad!

538
01:00:21,244 --> 01:00:24,246
Meg! Thank God you're all right!

539
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:26,415
Honey, is Kevin with you?

540
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:28,792
No. Isn't he staying at Eddie's house?

541
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,919
Eddie says they were staying
at your house.

542
01:00:31,003 --> 01:00:34,130
Oh, God! He must've snuck off
to that damn movie.

543
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,800
What movie?
You didn't tell me about any movie.

544
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:40,428
Sir, my little brother is
at the movie theatre on Main Street.

545
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,638
We're going by sector.
We'll be there soon.

546
01:00:42,763 --> 01:00:44,974
- You don't...
- We'll handle it. Back in line.

547
01:00:45,057 --> 01:00:47,267
Seems you're doing nothing.
You on a break?

548
01:00:47,351 --> 01:00:49,686
- Look, Mr....
- Don't "Look, Mr." me. I pay taxes.

549
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:51,897
I pay your salary.
I want you to find my son!

550
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,773
I know you're upset, but get in line...

551
01:00:53,857 --> 01:00:55,442
...we have everything under control.

552
01:00:55,984 --> 01:01:00,947
Did you know that ten years ago tonight,
there was a horrible murder in this house?

553
01:01:01,114 --> 01:01:04,033
- No way! Come on.
- This man...

554
01:01:04,283 --> 01:01:05,701
You'll love this.

555
01:01:05,993 --> 01:01:07,911
He hot-curls her to death.

556
01:01:09,746 --> 01:01:11,581
Mister, we're trying to watch a...

557
01:02:34,991 --> 01:02:36,368
My zipper!

558
01:02:41,247 --> 01:02:43,040
Come on! Hurry!

559
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:45,459
Your feet!

560
01:02:49,963 --> 01:02:51,089
No!

561
01:02:54,926 --> 01:02:56,511
Hurry!

562
01:03:08,022 --> 01:03:09,106
Here!

563
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:10,732
Open it up!

564
01:03:14,486 --> 01:03:15,695
Eddie!

565
01:03:23,077 --> 01:03:24,995
Hurry! Go!

566
01:03:27,081 --> 01:03:28,165
Go!

567
01:03:43,262 --> 01:03:44,430
Come on, Meg!

568
01:03:45,514 --> 01:03:47,099
Meg, come on!

569
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:04,198
- Alpha Team, do you copy?
- Affirmative.

570
01:04:04,532 --> 01:04:05,533
Status report?

571
01:04:05,658 --> 01:04:07,201
Highway 31 closed.

572
01:04:07,368 --> 01:04:09,077
Phone lines down.

573
01:04:09,203 --> 01:04:11,705
We've got this town locked up tight.

574
01:04:21,297 --> 01:04:22,506
On up.

575
01:04:47,404 --> 01:04:51,491
We suspected that conditions in space
would have a mutating effect on bacteria...

576
01:04:51,658 --> 01:04:52,909
...but this!

577
01:04:52,993 --> 01:04:55,453
Its activity threw the satellite out of orbit.

578
01:04:55,537 --> 01:04:59,332
Correct. Our little experimental virus
seems to have grown up...

579
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:04,086
...into a plasmic life form
that hunts its prey.

580
01:05:04,378 --> 01:05:07,006
A predator. It's fantastic.

581
01:05:07,131 --> 01:05:10,384
Sir, the organism is growing
at a geometric rate.

582
01:05:10,467 --> 01:05:14,679
By all accounts, it's at least
a thousand times its original mass.

583
01:05:14,846 --> 01:05:17,682
This will put U.S. Defence years ahead
of the Russians.

584
01:05:17,807 --> 01:05:19,017
You don't understand.

585
01:05:19,142 --> 01:05:22,311
At this rate, by next week,
there may be no U.S.

586
01:05:22,478 --> 01:05:23,312
Nonsense!

587
01:05:23,688 --> 01:05:27,524
All we have to do is contain it.
As far as the locals are concerned...

588
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:29,693
...this is simply a medical quarantine.

589
01:05:29,776 --> 01:05:31,778
Nobody gets in, or out.

590
01:05:39,577 --> 01:05:42,955
Dr. Meddows, just for the record...

591
01:05:43,497 --> 01:05:46,792
...I don't agree with any of this.
Those people's lives are at stake.

592
01:05:47,001 --> 01:05:49,545
Don't you think I know that?

593
01:05:49,711 --> 01:05:53,256
This isn't one of your textbook exercises,
Mr. Jennings.

594
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:57,886
This is an experiment in biological warfare,
or hadn't you noticed?

595
01:05:58,344 --> 01:06:02,014
That organism could be the greatest
breakthrough in weapons research...

596
01:06:02,098 --> 01:06:03,516
...since man split the atom.

597
01:06:03,683 --> 01:06:06,894
What we do here will affect the balance
of world power!

598
01:06:07,853 --> 01:06:10,939
Of course there are lives at stake.
Whole nations, in fact.

599
01:06:11,064 --> 01:06:14,985
And that's far more important than
a handful of people in this small town.

600
01:06:15,819 --> 01:06:18,196
And that is my cross to bear...

601
01:06:18,696 --> 01:06:22,783
...Mr. Jennings.
Now, carry out your orders.

602
01:06:23,784 --> 01:06:25,119
Yes, sir.

603
01:06:26,662 --> 01:06:27,621
Colonel!

604
01:06:27,705 --> 01:06:30,082
Colonel, we've got a sighting.

605
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:33,043
Hargis here.

606
01:06:33,168 --> 01:06:35,628
An eyewitness saw the organism
pursue civilians...

607
01:06:35,754 --> 01:06:38,881
- ...into the sewers.
- lt's got Kevin, Eddie and Meg down there.

608
01:06:38,965 --> 01:06:40,341
You've got to do something.

609
01:06:40,466 --> 01:06:41,467
Excellent!

610
01:06:41,592 --> 01:06:43,302
We need a schematic of the sewers.

611
01:06:43,427 --> 01:06:47,014
We'll contain it down there.
I want that organism alive.

612
01:06:47,222 --> 01:06:49,308
What about the civilians?

613
01:06:54,396 --> 01:06:56,189
They're expendable.

614
01:07:00,443 --> 01:07:01,486
Get up.

615
01:07:08,575 --> 01:07:09,910
Stop him!

616
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:13,371
Attention!

617
01:07:13,455 --> 01:07:15,915
We have an infected civilian
trying to escape.

618
01:07:16,041 --> 01:07:18,543
Stop him before he reaches
a populated area!

619
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,733
Halt, or we'll open fire!
I repeat: Halt, or we'll open fire!

620
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:17,388
Turn!

621
01:09:23,741 --> 01:09:27,411
Handicapped persons,
or persons in need of special assistance...

622
01:09:27,494 --> 01:09:31,498
...may report to the Blue Station,
located on the north lawn.

623
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:38,004
Dr. Sims and Dr. Divatni,
please report to Med. Unit 1.

624
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:48,347
- Are these the schematics?
- Yes, sir.

625
01:09:48,472 --> 01:09:51,224
The whole town's sitting
on a system of aqueducts...

626
01:09:51,308 --> 01:09:52,934
...run off from the mountains.

627
01:09:53,018 --> 01:09:55,186
Can the organism be contained?

628
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:59,732
There seem to be three main junctions.
Here, here, and here.

629
01:10:00,858 --> 01:10:04,111
If we close off those valves,
I think we got it.

630
01:10:08,615 --> 01:10:10,075
Is it still after us?

631
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,368
I don't think so.

632
01:10:11,535 --> 01:10:15,830
I'll be good, I swear.
I'll never see a movie, ever again.

633
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:17,790
It's going to be okay.

634
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:21,252
Let's just find a way out of here.

635
01:10:25,464 --> 01:10:26,715
This way.

636
01:10:27,257 --> 01:10:31,511
Baker Team,
we place you 80 metres south of Valve 2.

637
01:10:46,567 --> 01:10:49,820
Come on. That's our way out of here.

638
01:10:55,742 --> 01:10:57,202
Watch out for the rat.

639
01:10:57,368 --> 01:10:58,703
What rat?

640
01:11:06,335 --> 01:11:07,461
Run!

641
01:11:11,506 --> 01:11:12,549
Run!

642
01:11:17,387 --> 01:11:18,805
Get up the post. Move!

643
01:11:19,138 --> 01:11:21,098
Come on, climb! Go!

644
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:30,524
No!

645
01:11:30,607 --> 01:11:32,567
Get him out of there!

646
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:35,403
No!

647
01:11:52,044 --> 01:11:53,587
Come on!

648
01:12:20,945 --> 01:12:22,530
I can't get through!

649
01:12:22,613 --> 01:12:24,365
You can make it, Meg! Come on!

650
01:12:24,448 --> 01:12:26,116
Run, Kevin! Run!

651
01:12:36,918 --> 01:12:38,670
We have orders not to shoot!

652
01:12:43,132 --> 01:12:45,259
Run, Kevin! Go to Town Hall!

653
01:12:45,342 --> 01:12:46,385
No! But, Meg...

654
01:12:46,468 --> 01:12:47,886
Do it now!

655
01:13:52,654 --> 01:13:54,489
What are you doing?

656
01:13:55,615 --> 01:13:56,908
Hang on!

657
01:14:01,287 --> 01:14:02,496
Brian!

658
01:14:11,922 --> 01:14:14,090
- You all right?
- Yeah.

659
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:26,518
Forget about it, Brian.
Let's go. Forget about it!

660
01:14:35,527 --> 01:14:37,904
It got them. Bigelow and Wilson.

661
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:39,697
How do we get out of here?

662
01:14:39,781 --> 01:14:43,200
They were trying to scream.
Inside it. Trying to scream...

663
01:14:43,284 --> 01:14:46,078
Listen to me! How do we get out of here?

664
01:14:46,161 --> 01:14:47,788
Brian, he's hurt!

665
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,131
I think...

666
01:14:58,923 --> 01:15:01,217
...we'd better go now.

667
01:15:08,057 --> 01:15:11,977
Baker Team, Baker Team,
what the hell's going on down there?

668
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:19,817
We're coming up!

669
01:15:23,821 --> 01:15:25,489
Close the manhole.

670
01:15:26,699 --> 01:15:28,617
That's my man down there!

671
01:15:29,451 --> 01:15:33,747
We've got to contain that thing.
Now, close it off! That's an order!

672
01:15:36,332 --> 01:15:37,542
Do it.

673
01:15:41,712 --> 01:15:42,838
Hey!

674
01:15:44,965 --> 01:15:45,966
No!

675
01:16:02,023 --> 01:16:03,816
You son of a bitch!

676
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:10,697
Colonel, you can't!
That thing's down here with us!

677
01:16:11,865 --> 01:16:13,200
Meddows!

678
01:16:13,450 --> 01:16:15,076
Do you hear me, Meddows?

679
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:18,830
Talk to me, man!

680
01:16:20,123 --> 01:16:21,582
Meddows!

681
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:24,502
The water's rising.

682
01:16:25,753 --> 01:16:27,671
It's coming for us.

683
01:16:32,008 --> 01:16:35,136
I thought you were going to take care
of yourself.

684
01:16:36,763 --> 01:16:38,556
I guess I blew it.

685
01:16:41,058 --> 01:16:42,518
I'm sorry, Meg.

686
01:16:43,811 --> 01:16:45,271
I really am.

687
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:57,907
This thing work?

688
01:16:58,408 --> 01:17:00,535
- Does this thing work?
- It won't do any good.

689
01:17:00,618 --> 01:17:02,620
Not against that thing.

690
01:17:03,412 --> 01:17:04,789
All right, Meddows.

691
01:17:04,914 --> 01:17:06,415
If you won't listen to me...

692
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,125
...listen to this.

693
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:10,627
Shit!

694
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:20,178
Fire in Sector 2!
Charlie Squad to Sector 2!

695
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:31,730
All right, people, please stay
where you are! Stay out of the street!

696
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:36,818
Mobile weapon units to Sector 2!
Mobile weapon units to Sector 2!

697
01:17:39,654 --> 01:17:42,823
We got a man down in Sector 2.
On the double!

698
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:54,709
Flagg!

699
01:17:55,919 --> 01:17:56,961
Drop it!

700
01:17:58,129 --> 01:17:59,172
Stay back.

701
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:00,506
It's a lie!

702
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:02,049
All of it!

703
01:18:05,886 --> 01:18:09,973
I said, put it down!
I'll blow you out of your shoes, boy.

704
01:18:13,810 --> 01:18:14,853
Shoot him.

705
01:18:15,478 --> 01:18:17,063
Freeze, mister!

706
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:22,318
All right, hold on.

707
01:18:23,778 --> 01:18:25,070
Everybody...

708
01:18:25,988 --> 01:18:28,198
...just lower your weapons.

709
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:31,243
Hold your positions.

710
01:18:31,326 --> 01:18:32,744
Don't come any closer.

711
01:18:33,453 --> 01:18:36,873
He's infected! Contagious!

712
01:18:37,832 --> 01:18:40,376
He'll spread a plague through this place...

713
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:42,295
...and kill all of you!

714
01:18:43,713 --> 01:18:46,340
Listen to me, Briggs. Think for a minute.

715
01:18:47,341 --> 01:18:50,761
Do you think an army of guys,
in plastic suits, show up every time...

716
01:18:50,844 --> 01:18:52,637
...a meteor falls?

717
01:18:52,721 --> 01:18:54,764
Shoot him. That's a direct order!

718
01:18:55,015 --> 01:18:57,350
How do you think they got here so quick?

719
01:18:57,517 --> 01:19:00,603
- How did they know when to come?
- Shoot! Damn it, shoot!

720
01:19:00,686 --> 01:19:03,898
I'll tell you how! That meteor is manmade!

721
01:19:04,231 --> 01:19:06,984
Some kind of a germ warfare test
they fucked up!

722
01:19:07,067 --> 01:19:08,569
Don't try it!

723
01:19:44,727 --> 01:19:47,062
Let's scrag that son of a bitch!

724
01:19:59,824 --> 01:20:02,326
Satchel charge! Short fuse!

725
01:20:38,568 --> 01:20:41,154
Chew on that, slime ball.

726
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:06,010
What's happening?

727
01:21:06,385 --> 01:21:08,679
I think you pissed it off.

728
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:31,325
Go!

729
01:21:48,841 --> 01:21:50,175
My God...

730
01:21:50,759 --> 01:21:52,886
- ...the day has come.
- Reverend, come on!

731
01:21:53,011 --> 01:21:54,846
You don't understand.

732
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:58,641
This has all been prophesied.

733
01:22:04,355 --> 01:22:08,192
Move! Get out, everybody!
Everybody, back!

734
01:22:10,652 --> 01:22:13,697
He ran for it, Meg. Let's go! Move!

735
01:22:15,865 --> 01:22:17,033
Come on.

736
01:22:35,342 --> 01:22:36,676
Reverend!

737
01:22:43,599 --> 01:22:45,100
Meg, look out!

738
01:22:49,521 --> 01:22:52,107
It's the cold. It can't stand the cold!

739
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:12,918
Hurry!

740
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:21,842
Barricade all the entrances!

741
01:23:43,612 --> 01:23:45,990
Get some more CO2 over here!

742
01:23:47,449 --> 01:23:49,660
Look out! Coming through.

743
01:23:50,702 --> 01:23:52,829
It's empty, Meg! Get back!

744
01:23:53,663 --> 01:23:55,040
Stay here!

745
01:24:06,634 --> 01:24:10,262
And the great voice spoke
to the seven angels and said: "Go your..."

746
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:14,432
There! Right there!

747
01:24:18,519 --> 01:24:19,395
It's out!

748
01:24:19,479 --> 01:24:20,980
Find some more!

749
01:25:58,528 --> 01:25:59,821
Help me.

750
01:26:32,184 --> 01:26:35,270
Come on! You can do better than that!

751
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:44,987
Come on, you son of a bitch.

752
01:28:04,351 --> 01:28:05,811
What a rush.

753
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:35,005
Hey, man...

754
01:28:35,171 --> 01:28:36,881
...I told you we'd get snow.

755
01:28:37,048 --> 01:28:38,925
You got to have faith.

756
01:28:40,676 --> 01:28:43,262
I wonder if I'm covered
for this sort of thing.

757
01:28:43,429 --> 01:28:46,015
Dave, bring in the dump truck.

758
01:28:46,307 --> 01:28:49,810
We better get this thing
to the icehouse before dawn.

759
01:28:59,777 --> 01:29:04,782
The will of God is written in the sky
in fingers of flame.

760
01:29:06,867 --> 01:29:09,411
Wormwood falls from Heaven...

761
01:29:09,494 --> 01:29:12,205
...consuming sinner and saint alike!

762
01:29:12,998 --> 01:29:17,043
Who shall be lifted up to rapture...

763
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:19,712
...when the judgement trumpet blows?

764
01:29:21,631 --> 01:29:23,841
None but the faithful...

765
01:29:24,675 --> 01:29:26,885
...brothers and sisters!

766
01:29:27,428 --> 01:29:31,264
None but the faithful.

767
01:30:06,505 --> 01:30:08,257
When, Reverend?

768
01:30:10,717 --> 01:30:11,927
Ma'am?

769
01:30:12,177 --> 01:30:15,597
The day of reckoning, how far off?

770
01:30:17,015 --> 01:30:20,017
Soon, madam. Soon.

771
01:30:26,565 --> 01:30:29,359
The Lord will give me a sign.

772
01:31:24,860 --> 01:34:55,960
