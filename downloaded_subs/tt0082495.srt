00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,939
I want you to listen to me.
I want you to go out of the house
and down the street to the MacKenzies' house.

2
00:00:56,044 --> 00:00:57,608
I want you to knock on their door.

3
00:00:57,712 --> 00:01:00,840
I want you to tell them to call the police
and send'em over here.

4
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,196
All right?

5
00:01:02,404 --> 00:01:04,177
Laurie. - Do as I say.
- Yeah.

6
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:07,201
Go.

7
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:30,558
Get help!

8
00:01:30,662 --> 00:01:31,705
Come on!

9
00:01:32,122 --> 00:01:33,165
Come on!

10
00:02:03,193 --> 00:02:04,549
Oh, no.

11
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:15,602
Help!

12
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:49,595
It was the boogeyman.

13
00:02:55,017 --> 00:02:56,477
As a matter of fact ...

14
00:02:56,685 --> 00:02:57,937
it was.

15
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:55,389
What's going on out here?

16
00:03:55,493 --> 00:03:56,536
Call the police!

17
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,204
Tell the sheriff I shot him!

18
00:03:58,413 --> 00:03:58,830
Who?

19
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,480
Tell him he's still on the loose!
- Is this some kind of joke?

20
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:05,086
I've been trick-or-treated to death tonight!

21
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:07,380
You don't know what death is!

22
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:39,572
Trick or treat.

23
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:05,119
I shot him six times!

24
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:08,247
What?
- I shot him six times!

25
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:10,333
I ... I shot him in the heart and ...

26
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:14,191
He cannot get a very far, come on.
- I shot him six times!

27
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,546
This guy ...

28
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,362
he's not human!

29
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:44,219
Harold, you want mayonnaise on your sandwich?

30
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:51,623
How about mustard?

31
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:58,818
Up next some more spine melting madness
"Night of the Living Dead"
- Are you asleep again?

32
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:12,269
This is a WWAR special bulletin ...

33
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:18,317
Police in Haddonfield have just made the grisly discovery
of three bodies in the upstairs bedrooms of this house.

34
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,862

35
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,511

00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:27,284
Two girls and a boy.

38
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,086
He is now believed to be at large in Haddonfield.

39
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:39,171
This is Robert Mundy ... live.

40
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:48,973
They're coming to get you Barbara.

41
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:52,727
You're ignorant.
- They're coming for you, Barbara.

42
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:55,855
Stop it. You're acting like a child.

43
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,523
They're coming for you.

44
00:09:58,045 --> 00:09:58,462
Look ...

45
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,443
There comes one of them now.

46
00:10:00,651 --> 00:10:02,737
She'll hear you.
Here he comes now.

47
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:04,405
I'm gettitng out of here.

48
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:27,448
Mrs. Elrod?!

49
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,263
Mr. Elrod?

50
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:34,225
Are you ok?

51
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:48,406
Hi.

52
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:51,222
There was someone screaming next door.

53
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:53,829
Yeah, Mr. a Mrs. Elrod.

54
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:56,331
His wife's always picking on him.

55
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,668
He probably got angry and decided to start beating her.

56
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,943
Ok, deal.

57
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:05,507
Are your folks home?

58
00:11:05,716 --> 00:11:07,593
They are gone.

59
00:11:07,697 --> 00:11:12,598
My dad had to take my Aunt Ruby to Harden County
and my mother's decided to go along.

60
00:11:12,702 --> 00:11:13,953
Didn't you hear?

61
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:15,413
Hear about what?

62
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:17,707
Some girl got killed in Haddonfield.

63
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,376
It's on the radio.

64
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:20,940

00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:25,632

66
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:26,466

Three teenagers have been found murdered
in the house in the Northwest section of Haddonfield.

68
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:34,287
The names of the teenagers have not been released ...
- I can't believe it.

69
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:35,225
I know.

70
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:37,519
You know we probably knew her.
- Where did it happen?

71
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:39,187

72
00:11:40,126 --> 00:11:42,628
That's right down the street.
- I know.

73
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:47,216
Police confirmed the girl was rescued that she ...
- Sally, I can hear the sirens coming.

74
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:48,885
They said the guy got away.

75
00:11:49,406 --> 00:11:50,970
Do they know who it was?
- No.

76
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,890
Oh, god.

77
00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:56,184
Alice?

78
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:57,539
Alice ...

79
00:11:58,895 --> 00:11:59,729

He believe that suspect will be apprehended ...

84
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,534
within a matter of hours.

85
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:20,686
Neighboor say they heard scream during the early evening,
but activity a noise it's for usual haloween.

86
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:45,712
I came out on the lawn.
I asked him what was going on.

87
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:47,484
He said ...
- Inside you guys.

88
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:49,465
He said he'd shot somebody.

89
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:21,269
All right folks. Give'em a room, please?

90
00:13:47,545 --> 00:13:48,484

91
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:50,986
Can you hear me?
- Don't let them put me to sleep.

92
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:55,364
It's all right, take it easy. We're gonna go to clinic, all right?
- Don't let them put me to sleep. - It's ok.

93
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:05,166

95
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,545
Yeh, her name's Laurie Strode.

00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:11,526

Ok, just get out easy.

00:14:36,135 --> 00:14:37,073
It's gonna be ok.

101
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,159

110
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,537
Oh, great.

111
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:07,684

Get that out of here.

115
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:22,804
Oh, Laurie.

116
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:24,368
Hi there.

120
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:33,544
We'll need to a type it.

121
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:40,635
When was the last time you had a tetatus shot?

122
00:16:41,156 --> 00:16:42,407

123
00:16:48,664 --> 00:16:49,811

00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:58,570
No, don't put me to sleep.

128
00:16:58,674 --> 00:17:00,029

No.

130
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:05,347
Please don't put me to sleep.

131
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:08,997
Take it easy.

Take it easy, Laurie.

135
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,617
Circle the block again.

136
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,328
How long now?

137
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:31,414
It's about 30 minutes. Put light down there.

138
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,186
There, by those trees.

139
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:35,272
There is nothing.

140
00:17:35,376 --> 00:17:36,940
Well, keep going.

141
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:39,964
You know Doctor, I'm just about there.

142
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:40,902
What?

143
00:17:41,111 --> 00:17:43,822
The point where I stop taking orders from you.

144
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:47,054
Alright sheriff whatever you want.

145
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:49,661
The primary concern is that we stop him.

146
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:51,434
You let him out.

147
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,145
I didn't.
- His own goddamn doctor.

148
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:56,126
I didn't let him out.

149
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:58,107
Hey Brackett come in please...

150
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,297
Hey Brackett come in please ...

151
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:01,131

152
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,904
Geez, this is amsey.

153
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:04,364
Say again, what is it?

154
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:05,511
This is Ramsey.

155
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:06,971
Where are you?

156
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:11,663
I'm out by the bakery moving north on the Scottsville road.
- Get the hell back in the town.

157
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:14,583
Go up 17th street, meet me by the bypass.

158
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:16,564
10 - 4 Ramsey clear.

159
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:19,066
Will you put that thing away!

160
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:23,341
You couldn't have shot him six times!

161
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:26,574
You think I'm lying, sherif.
- I think you missed him.

162
00:18:26,678 --> 00:18:30,119
No man could take six shots.
- I've told you this isn't a man.

163
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:34,916
Look out! Slow down!
- Why? - Over there! Look, look, look!

164
00:18:38,044 --> 00:18:38,878
Is that him?

165
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:40,234
I don't know.

166
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:43,258
Get back!

167
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:45,030
Run! Come on, run!

168
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:46,073

174
00:18:57,022 --> 00:18:58,064
Stop!

175
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,628
Don't shoot!

176
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,340
Stop!
- Don't kill him!

177
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:15,789
Oh, sheriff Brackett.

178
00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:19,126
He came out of nowhere.

179
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,585
I couldn't stop.

180
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:21,732
Is it him?!

181
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:28,614
Is it him or not!?

182
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:36,643
Leigh ...

183
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:40,189
We've been found three bodies.
- Where?

184
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:42,483
Across the street from the Doyle house.

185
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:44,151
Three kids ...

186
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:46,654
Leigh...
one of them was Annie!

187
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:47,801
What?

188
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:00,209
Does it hurt a lot?

189
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,295
What?

190
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:08,030
Oh sweetie, I can't understand you. Look, it'll be ok.
We'll play some games tonight and ...

191
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:10,428
Repeating for those of you who just tuned in.

192
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:12,409
Three people are dead tonight ...

193
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:15,746
as a resolve an attack by an escaped mental patient.

194
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:18,561
I understand we're going to stay on the air now?

195
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:21,064
Repeating for those of you who just tuned in.

196
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:23,149
Three people are dead tonight ...

197
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:26,486
as a resolve an attack by an escaped mental patient.

198
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,553
Any further details will be report coming
as soon as we get them.

199
00:20:31,178 --> 00:20:32,534
This is Robert Munday ...

200
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:34,306
reporting you live.

201
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:07,255
Hi ...

202
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:09,444
Hi.

203
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,155
Jimmy ...

204
00:21:14,554 --> 00:21:15,701
Oh, how are you feeling?

205
00:21:16,848 --> 00:21:18,203
Sore.

206
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:21,644
What happened?

207
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:23,000
Cracked the bone.

208
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:24,877
Lucky it wasn't a break.

209
00:21:24,981 --> 00:21:28,943
Doctor Mixter felt that he should wait untill tomorrow,
before he put cast on.

210
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:30,716
You have to get some rest.

211
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:33,740
Come on, Jimmy.

212
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:45,106
Can I get you something to drink or anything?

213
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:47,400
How about a coke?

214
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:48,964
Ok.

215
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:50,736
Thanks.

216
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:51,883
Ok.

217
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:52,509
Come on!

218
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:55,220
Jimmy, we've got to roll. Another call came in.
- Ok.

219
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:56,889
I'll get you that coke later.

220
00:21:57,723 --> 00:21:58,661
Out.

221
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:05,648
Moments ago police reported that Michael Myers,
formerly of Haddonfield,

222
00:22:05,752 --> 00:22:10,861
who fled the Smith's Grove Warren county Sanitarium
last night was believed to have burned to death.

223
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:15,449
Meanwhile, three bodies were discovered
in the upstairs bedroom of the house directly behind me.

224
00:22:15,553 --> 00:22:19,099
Identification of the victims is being witheld.
Pending notification of their families ...

225
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:21,914
Forget that. forget that.
I wanna concentrate on that house.

226
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:24,834
Talk to some kids. See if anybody saw anything.

227
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:30,047
You need the parent's permission to use a statement.
If you can't find the parents, get a statement anyway.

228
00:22:32,237 --> 00:22:33,382
Not now ...

229
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:40,785
Give us a minute, fellas.

230
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:12,693
I .. uh

231
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:19,575
have to ... go and tell my wife,
before somebody else does.

232
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:23,329
Go on home, Leigh.

233
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:25,831
Go on home, I'll take care of everything.

234
00:23:26,144 --> 00:23:31,671
Damn you! - I'm sorrry. -What have you done?
- I haven't done anything. - YOU LET HIM OUT!

235
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:35,216
I didn't let him out.
I gave orders for him to be restrained.

236
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:39,074
Now is there anything else, that we can do for you?

237
00:23:39,387 --> 00:23:43,245
If that wasn't Michael Myers burning up in that car ...

238
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:46,895
then lot of other kids are gonna be slaugtered tonight.
- He's dead.

239
00:23:47,103 --> 00:23:49,189
I saw him.
- You saw man at the mask.

240
00:23:49,293 --> 00:23:54,611
It was him. - I wanna believe you,
but I gotta be sure.
I can't stop, untill I'm certain it's dead.

241
00:23:54,819 --> 00:24:00,867
You talk about him like he's some kind of animal.
- He was my ... - Would you keep it back?!
He was my patient for fifteen years ...

242
00:24:00,971 --> 00:24:06,811
He became an obsession with me, until I realized,
that there was nothing within.
Neither consciance nor reason that was ...

243
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:09,418
even remotely human.

244
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:14,840
An hour ago I stood up and fired six shots into him
and he just got up and walked away.

245
00:24:14,944 --> 00:24:19,634
I am talking about the real possibility,
that he is STILL OUT THERE!

246
00:24:20,886 --> 00:24:22,241
Where'd they take the body?

247
00:24:22,554 --> 00:24:23,805
The Coroner's office.

248
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:26,516
Get a dentist to meet me there in half an hour.

249
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:42,991
Despite the fact that the man, who rescued Laurie Strode,
claims to have shot him six times at close range.

250
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,537
Haddonfield police have no explanation
for the suspect's disappearance ...

251
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:51,646
But say they're confident, he will be captured soon.
- I cannot believe it.
Paramedics are now removing the last of the bodies.

252
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,713
Pin the tail on the donkey and bobbing for apples.
Actually bobbing for water. No less.

253
00:24:55,817 --> 00:25:02,178
Well you gotta use water to see if you don't ...
- I am never going to another halloween party
as long as I live. Especially not at Stevie Mather's house.

254
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:03,846
And of course now I'm gonna be late.

255
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,827
Oh, you gotta drive me home first.

256
00:25:06,036 --> 00:25:08,643
Oh Darcy, I don't have time.
- You've got to.

257
00:25:09,894 --> 00:25:11,771
Oh, can't you ask Eddie Lee?

258
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:13,752
He's in Russelville.

259
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:19,383
It's five minutes to your house another five minutes
back to the hospital. Mrs. Alves's gonna kill me.

260
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:21,885
You promised me.

261
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:26,265
I know I did.

262
00:25:49,518 --> 00:25:51,186
One survivor ...

263
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:56,712
17- year  old Laurie Strode was found directly across
the street from the home, where the murders took place.

264
00:25:56,817 --> 00:26:02,133
The teenager was taken across town to
Haddonfield Memorial Clinic. Paramedics on the scene ...

265
00:27:22,006 --> 00:27:28,992
In of aftermath of the killings the streets between
Chestnut and tenth third jamed with people and ... cars.

266
00:27:29,826 --> 00:27:30,660
Repeating ...

267
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:35,874
that a ... These streets a Chestnut and tenth
there are just jamed with both people ...

268
00:27:35,978 --> 00:27:38,168
Well, I sure could go for a pizza now.

269
00:27:39,107 --> 00:27:42,339
Nice be with sausage, onions, peppers ...

270
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,465
But no mushrooms. I hate mushrooms.

271
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:51,304
The names of young victims are not yet released,
but people would probably recognized,
that is neighbourhood teenagers.

272
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:53,703
Looks like a goddamn homecoming.

273
00:27:57,978 --> 00:27:58,812
Now ...

274
00:27:58,916 --> 00:27:59,751
back ...

275
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:01,523
to Dementia ...

276
00:28:31,345 --> 00:28:32,701
Thanks, Mr. Garret.

277
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,938
Julie saw him you know.

278
00:28:42,294 --> 00:28:43,128
Who?

279
00:28:43,545 --> 00:28:45,214
Michael Myers.

280
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:46,569
Come on.

281
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:48,759
I swear. Yesterday, when she was coming to work.

282
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:50,427
Where did she see him?

283
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,555
Near the shop and bag out by the mall.

284
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:55,745
Well, she stopped at the light ...

285
00:28:55,954 --> 00:28:59,186
and saw him walk in that field
behind the Lost River Dive in.

286
00:29:00,855 --> 00:29:04,087
Julie said he was so creepy.
- Julie's full of shit.

287
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:06,277
He didn't escape until last night.

288
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:10,343
Well you don't have to swear, Budd.

289
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,637
She's a goddamn moron anyway.

290
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,974
Every other word you say is either hell or shit or damn.

291
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:18,268
I'm sorry.

292
00:29:18,894 --> 00:29:20,875
I guess I just fuck up all the time.

293
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:34,116
Hi.

294
00:29:37,348 --> 00:29:38,182
Hey, you're here.

295
00:29:38,287 --> 00:29:38,912
Hi.

296
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:39,851
You're late.

297
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:42,457
Yea I know, I've got to get on the ward.

298
00:29:43,187 --> 00:29:43,917
Hi. Jimmy.

299
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:46,003
Oh, hi. Karen.

300
00:29:51,008 --> 00:29:52,155
Come on.

301
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:54,345
See you later.

302
00:29:54,553 --> 00:29:55,283
Great.

303
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:01,748
* Amazing grace ... *

304
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:04,668
* come sit on my face *

305
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,483
* Don't make me cry ... *

306
00:30:07,587 --> 00:30:09,464
* I need your pie *

307
00:30:09,568 --> 00:30:11,550
Look, why don't you just shut up, all right?

308
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,635
What do you all worked up about?

309
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:14,991
Look it could be Ziggy, you know?

310
00:30:15,095 --> 00:30:17,493
It could've been your brother Mark,
we pulled out of there.

311
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:19,370
All right, so what do you want me to do?

312
00:30:20,413 --> 00:30:21,038
Look Jimmy ...

313
00:30:21,247 --> 00:30:23,958
Rule number one: never get involved with a patient.

314
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:25,522
Nurses ...

315
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:27,295
that's another story.

316
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:30,006
But patients is no good. It never works out.

317
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:33,238
Where you going college boy?

318
00:30:33,656 --> 00:30:35,637
I'm telling you, listen to old Budd.

319
00:31:45,915 --> 00:31:47,583
You were late again tonight.

320
00:31:49,981 --> 00:31:51,441
Just fifteen minutes.

321
00:31:51,545 --> 00:31:54,882
That could be the difference
between life and death for one of those kids.

322
00:31:56,342 --> 00:31:59,679
You're right. I'm sorry Mrs. Alves.
- I don't wanna hear any excuses.

323
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:01,556
You're a good nurse Karen.

324
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,494
I'd hate to loose you.

325
00:32:02,598 --> 00:32:04,475
But you've got to learn to be on time.

326
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:06,144
Now. Let's get over this list.

327
00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:09,272
I'll be fine, really. I'm sorry. I promise.
- Ok..

328
00:32:11,357 --> 00:32:11,774
Carr ...

329
00:32:11,983 --> 00:32:14,068
Mrs. Carr, 9:30 tommorow morning.

330
00:32:14,277 --> 00:32:15,320
God, they should have ...

331
00:32:15,424 --> 00:32:17,405
They should have handled him more carefully.

332
00:32:18,448 --> 00:32:19,282
Who?

333
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,306
Michael Myers.

334
00:32:24,496 --> 00:32:25,956
Michael Myers?

335
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:28,041
Yea, he ...

336
00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:29,501
He was that guy, that was after you.

337
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:35,027
You mean the Myers house?

338
00:32:38,468 --> 00:32:41,179
That little kid who killed his sister?
- Yea.

339
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:46,810
But he's in a hospital somewhere.

340
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:48,687
He escaped last night.

341
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,043
How do you know?

342
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,128
It's all over the radio.

343
00:32:52,232 --> 00:32:54,422
Television too. It's on right now.

344
00:33:00,364 --> 00:33:01,615
Why me?

345
00:33:04,117 --> 00:33:05,786
I mean, why me?

346
00:33:08,497 --> 00:33:09,957
Times up Jimmy.

347
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:11,938
Let's go.

348
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:13,085
OK. ok.

349
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:19,550
No you won't!

350
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:21,844
Visiting hours are definitely over.

351
00:33:25,598 --> 00:33:28,413
Men ... you can't live with'em,
you can't live without'em.

352
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:30,916
How's that shoulder feel?

353
00:33:31,854 --> 00:33:33,001
A little better.

354
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,252
Good.

355
00:33:34,774 --> 00:33:37,068
We've been trying to get ahold of your parents.

356
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:42,281
Dr. Mixter told me, they were at the same party he was,
but they're not there now and they're not at home.

357
00:33:42,594 --> 00:33:44,575
Do you have any idea of where else they might be?

358
00:33:46,035 --> 00:33:46,974
No.

359
00:33:48,121 --> 00:33:49,685
I'll just keep trying.

360
00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:01,572
Oh, this is just ...

361
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,283
Janet?

362
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,767
Yes Mrs. Alves.

363
00:34:08,975 --> 00:34:11,165
Go tell Mr. Garrett, we're having trouble with the phones.

364
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:12,521
Right now.

365
00:34:13,146 --> 00:34:15,336
He's at the other end of the hall.
- Janet.

366
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:17,943
Yes, Mrs. Alves.

367
00:34:20,862 --> 00:34:22,426
What's wrong with the phones?

368
00:34:24,408 --> 00:34:26,285
Nothing for you to worry about.

369
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,683
Just get some rest right now.

370
00:34:28,996 --> 00:34:31,498
I'll let you know as soon as we get ahold of your parents.

371
00:35:00,484 --> 00:35:01,944
I'm gonna go check the phone.

372
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:04,655
You wait here and I'll call you.
- I have to get back on the floor!

373
00:35:04,864 --> 00:35:08,722
It'll take me five minutes.
- But I don't even know, how to use this thing!

374
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:12,551
I think somebody broke into the store room.
The lock was off.

375
00:38:17,035 --> 00:38:18,286
Mr. Garrett?

376
00:38:19,224 --> 00:38:20,789
I can't hear you.

377
00:38:22,665 --> 00:38:26,106
One of you had better drive down
to the sherif's station right away.

378
00:38:31,946 --> 00:38:34,448
Mr. Garrett, how do you work this thing?

379
00:38:34,553 --> 00:38:35,595
Janet!

380
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,000
Mr. Garrett.

381
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,581
Mr. Garrett?

382
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:12,046
Mr. Garrett ... I gotta get back on the floor.

383
00:40:15,487 --> 00:40:16,530
Hello?

384
00:40:32,692 --> 00:40:34,047
It's difficult.

385
00:40:34,256 --> 00:40:36,446
Even the gums are charred but ...

386
00:40:36,758 --> 00:40:37,801
... look here.

387
00:40:39,574 --> 00:40:40,617
See here?

388
00:40:41,034 --> 00:40:42,494
No fillings.

389
00:40:42,702 --> 00:40:46,039
He's young. Maybe seventeen, maybe eighteen.

390
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:48,020
Michael Myers is 21.

391
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,670
Positive ID means we check x-rays and dental records.

392
00:40:51,774 --> 00:40:53,234
That'll take hours!

393
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:56,675
No other way to know for sure. I'm sorry.
- We haven't got hours.

394
00:40:56,779 --> 00:41:00,428
Listen to me. We've got to assume,
that Michael Myers is still alive.

395
00:41:05,121 --> 00:41:06,581
Everybody goes back out.

396
00:41:06,685 --> 00:41:07,936
But we just closed it up.

397
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,169
I want to sweep from Chestnut South to the bypass.

398
00:41:11,273 --> 00:41:12,316
I want every street ...

399
00:41:12,524 --> 00:41:13,775
every house ...

400
00:41:14,401 --> 00:41:16,069
every backyard.

401
00:41:16,695 --> 00:41:17,738
Ok.

402
00:41:18,051 --> 00:41:19,198
You've got it.

403
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:25,037
Thank you.

404
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:41,301
All right, that's enough. That's enough!
Now come on, get out of here. You guys, go home.
Michael Myers not here.

405
00:41:50,582 --> 00:41:55,795
This is Hunt in another vehicle.
The old Myers house 45 Lampkin Ln. - The tribe.

406
00:41:56,317 --> 00:41:59,236
One of their number was butchered, this is a wake.

407
00:42:05,701 --> 00:42:07,995
Heightens my sense of security.

408
00:42:21,551 --> 00:42:23,323
All right. Knock it off!

409
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,660
Come on folks, go home.

410
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:29,163
Knock it off!!!

411
00:42:32,395 --> 00:42:33,229
Empty.

412
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:36,358
Plus we've covered the whole east end of town.
There's nothing.

413
00:42:36,462 --> 00:42:37,400
Check it again.

414
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:39,069
He just isn't here.

415
00:42:39,277 --> 00:42:40,633
CHECK IT again!

416
00:42:42,718 --> 00:42:43,552
You know.

417
00:42:44,282 --> 00:42:46,889
Haddonfield was a pretty quiet town before tonight.

418
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:48,036
The only a ...

419
00:42:48,245 --> 00:42:50,122
gunshot you ever heard

420
00:42:50,643 --> 00:42:52,833
were start tracking for the local highschool.

421
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:56,274
Yet one night in 1963 Michael Myers ...

422
00:42:56,795 --> 00:43:00,132
did murder his sister
in that upstairs bedroom with a large ...

423
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,696
butcher knife.

424
00:43:02,217 --> 00:43:03,469
I remember.

425
00:43:03,677 --> 00:43:06,388
On halloween.
- I was sixteen years old.

426
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:09,099
It's his anniversary, Mr. Hunt.

427
00:43:10,351 --> 00:43:11,602
He came back.

428
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:14,000
After fifteen years?

429
00:43:14,313 --> 00:43:17,024
He waited with extraordinary patience,

430
00:43:18,484 --> 00:43:19,422
There was a ...

431
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:22,342
force inside him biding its time.

432
00:43:23,278 --> 00:43:27,449
The stuff grew accustomed to his immobility and silence.

433
00:43:28,284 --> 00:43:32,037
In many ways he was the ideal patient.
He didn't talked he didn't ...

434
00:43:32,454 --> 00:43:34,853
cry. He didn't even move.

435
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:36,730
He just waited.

436
00:43:37,355 --> 00:43:39,858
The staff was unprepared they didn't ...

437
00:43:40,379 --> 00:43:42,465
know, what he was.

438
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,342
Did you know?

439
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,531
Yea I knew.

440
00:43:46,636 --> 00:43:47,678
Excuse me.

441
00:43:48,304 --> 00:43:49,242
Mr. Hunt?

442
00:43:50,077 --> 00:43:54,560
Yea. What is it Craig? - Yea. I'm worried about
Bennet Tramer. - He isn't home yet.
- Yea. And he left the party at ten.

443
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:56,437
It's only a little after ...

444
00:43:56,542 --> 00:43:57,689
eleven boys.

445
00:43:57,793 --> 00:43:59,148
He was real drunk.

446
00:43:59,461 --> 00:44:00,400
How old is he?

447
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:01,859
Seventeen.

448
00:44:01,964 --> 00:44:03,945
He had this stupid mask on.

449
00:44:04,362 --> 00:44:05,613
All right boys.

450
00:44:06,447 --> 00:44:07,386
Seventeen ...

451
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,159
... and wearing a mask.

452
00:44:10,618 --> 00:44:13,538
Oh god.
- We should check his dental records.

453
00:44:15,206 --> 00:44:19,377
Old reservoir road. They had break-in the
elementary school. They're pretty sure it's him. - Come on!

454
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:18,394
Oh, stop.

455
00:45:19,124 --> 00:45:20,896
Aw, shit!

456
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:24,025
Shit. - Oh, you idiot!

457
00:45:24,337 --> 00:45:25,693
You could've broken it.

458
00:45:26,527 --> 00:45:28,300
I wish I had!

459
00:45:30,281 --> 00:45:32,888
I also could have used these on you.

460
00:45:34,556 --> 00:45:35,912
What an asshole.

461
00:45:36,016 --> 00:45:37,267
Happy Halloween.

462
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,978
Budd ...

463
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:42,377
you are the biggest jerk ...

464
00:45:42,585 --> 00:45:44,045
I've ever met.

465
00:45:47,695 --> 00:45:48,946
But you love me.

466
00:45:50,093 --> 00:45:51,344
Yeah ...

467
00:45:52,387 --> 00:45:53,742
I'm an idiot.

468
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,317
Let's go down to the therapy room.

469
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:08,758
Budd's finger needs a little bit of therapy.

470
00:46:09,905 --> 00:46:11,990
I can't leave the kids right now.

471
00:46:12,094 --> 00:46:14,076
Well, everybody is all weirded out tonight?

472
00:46:14,284 --> 00:46:16,265
All this Michael Myers crap.

473
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:18,559
I just ...

474
00:46:21,062 --> 00:46:22,209
I just want ...

475
00:46:41,395 --> 00:46:43,376
The therapy room's three doors down.

476
00:46:47,964 --> 00:46:53,802
I suppose if we left the door open, we could hear if
somebody is coming ... or if the kids started to cry ...

477
00:46:54,636 --> 00:46:57,451
No. I ... I got to check it out first.

478
00:46:58,181 --> 00:46:59,328
Fifteen minutes.

479
00:47:01,622 --> 00:47:03,499
If everything's ok.

480
00:47:04,646 --> 00:47:06,002
You're wasting time.

481
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:19,453
Why don't you tell me?

482
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:22,581
Why don't you ever tell me anything?

483
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,458
I told you ...

484
00:47:25,188 --> 00:47:26,960
I'm NOT your mother.

485
00:49:02,785 --> 00:49:03,620
It's hot.

486
00:49:31,773 --> 00:49:33,233
It's hot in here.

487
00:49:35,214 --> 00:49:36,257
It's just me.

488
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:52,419
I'm not kidding.

489
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:55,756
It's too hot in here now, Budd.

490
00:49:56,069 --> 00:49:57,320
Why don't you go check?

491
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:00,761
It's cold out there.

492
00:50:02,429 --> 00:50:04,619
It can get cold in here.

493
00:50:07,643 --> 00:50:08,582
Gotcha.

494
00:51:24,177 --> 00:51:25,637
Forget it, Budd.

495
00:51:25,846 --> 00:51:27,306
I have to go back to work.

496
00:51:34,605 --> 00:51:36,690
You wanna go for breakfast later?

497
00:51:40,236 --> 00:51:41,383
No ...

498
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,847
I'm sorry.

499
00:51:50,663 --> 00:51:52,748
I just have to get back. That's all.

500
00:51:54,834 --> 00:51:57,023
Now. Budd, don't be that way.

501
00:52:35,811 --> 00:52:37,271
He got in here.

502
00:52:38,835 --> 00:52:40,086
And look over here.

503
00:52:49,054 --> 00:52:50,514
And here ...

504
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,107
Sister.

505
00:53:02,192 --> 00:53:03,235
Is that it?

506
00:53:03,548 --> 00:53:04,486
No.

507
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,154
Here.

508
00:53:13,245 --> 00:53:14,392
What's this?

509
00:53:14,705 --> 00:53:16,269
It's gibberish.

510
00:53:16,373 --> 00:53:17,312
No.

511
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,293
It's a celtic word.

512
00:53:20,336 --> 00:53:21,378
Samhain ...

513
00:53:22,525 --> 00:53:24,507
It means the Lord of the dead.

514
00:53:25,445 --> 00:53:26,696
The end of summer.

515
00:53:28,156 --> 00:53:29,407
The festival ...

516
00:53:29,512 --> 00:53:31,180
of samhain.

517
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,474
October 31st.

518
00:53:35,455 --> 00:53:36,706
Dr. Loomis?

519
00:53:36,811 --> 00:53:37,749
Yes?

520
00:53:38,896 --> 00:53:40,877
I have to talk to you.

521
00:53:42,754 --> 00:53:44,423
Oh, I didn't recognize you.

522
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,029
What are you doing here?

523
00:53:47,447 --> 00:53:48,800
Privately.

524
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,479
Thanks.

525
00:54:02,043 --> 00:54:03,190
Dr. Loomis ...

526
00:54:03,503 --> 00:54:05,797
You've been ordered back to Smith's Grove.

527
00:54:06,214 --> 00:54:07,256
Ordered?

528
00:54:07,674 --> 00:54:10,385
He can't order me.
- No, no ...

529
00:54:10,697 --> 00:54:12,262
but the governor can.

530
00:54:12,366 --> 00:54:15,598
He spoke to Dr. Rogers personally a few hours ago.
- The Governor ...

531
00:54:16,328 --> 00:54:17,475
well, well ...

532
00:54:17,684 --> 00:54:20,603
Dr. Loomis this thing is all over the state.

533
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:26,651
Patient escapes once, murders three teenagers.
You shoot him with a gun, he escapes again.

534
00:54:26,756 --> 00:54:28,945
Someone should have listened to me earlier.

535
00:54:29,362 --> 00:54:31,135
I know. I'm sorry.

536
00:54:32,282 --> 00:54:36,244
Dr. Rogers is just afraid that this could jeapordize
our whole rehabilitation program.

537
00:54:36,349 --> 00:54:41,875
He doesn't want anyone from the mental
health department anywhere near Haddonfield.
- Why did he send you down here then?

538
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:45,525
In case you already found him.

539
00:54:45,837 --> 00:54:47,923
... alive.
- Tell Dr. Rogers ...

540
00:54:48,027 --> 00:54:52,094
Tell him you couldn't find me. Tell him anything.
I can't leave Haddonfield now.

541
00:54:52,511 --> 00:54:54,492
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.

542
00:54:55,848 --> 00:54:58,872
There's a marshal waiting for you outside.

543
00:55:15,451 --> 00:55:16,598
Laurie ...

544
00:55:21,395 --> 00:55:22,542
listen ...

545
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:25,461
I know that ...

546
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:27,442
you don't know me very well.

547
00:55:28,381 --> 00:55:30,571
But I just wanna let you to know that ...

548
00:55:31,822 --> 00:55:34,322
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

549
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:35,678
Ok?

550
00:55:36,825 --> 00:55:37,555
Promise.

551
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:44,437
Laurie.

552
00:55:52,779 --> 00:55:53,926
Shit!

553
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:11,861
Dr. Mixter?!

554
00:56:14,989 --> 00:56:16,449
Dr. Mixter.

555
00:56:21,662 --> 00:56:23,226
Dr. Mixter!

556
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:41,578
Dr. Mixter?

557
00:56:46,166 --> 00:56:47,418
Dr. Mixter ...

558
00:56:47,522 --> 00:56:49,086
It's an emergency!

559
00:56:57,428 --> 00:56:59,931
Dr. Mixter, it's Laurie Strode.

560
00:57:00,243 --> 00:57:02,225
She's had a reaction to the medication.

561
00:57:02,642 --> 00:57:04,310
You better come quick.

562
00:57:09,419 --> 00:57:10,879
Dr. Mixter.

563
00:57:52,899 --> 00:57:55,193
This is ridiculous. I'm gonna go find Mrs. Alves.

564
00:58:04,578 --> 00:58:06,038
Mrs. Alves?

565
01:00:10,746 --> 01:00:11,685
Laurie?

566
01:00:11,893 --> 01:00:13,144
You ok?

567
01:02:39,644 --> 01:02:40,895
We will find him.

568
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:42,981
Where're you gonna look?

569
01:02:43,606 --> 01:02:44,858
I don't know.

570
01:02:46,317 --> 01:02:47,569
Neither do I.

571
01:03:17,391 --> 01:03:18,851
Mr. Garrett?

572
01:03:43,668 --> 01:03:45,753
Mr. Garrett!?

573
01:04:12,134 --> 01:04:13,696
Mr. Garrett?

574
01:04:16,199 --> 01:04:17,867
Mr. Garrett?

575
01:04:19,953 --> 01:04:20,787
Sorry.

576
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:22,664
Listen ...

577
01:04:23,915 --> 01:04:25,479
I can't find anybody.

578
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:27,460
Budd's gone ...
Mrs. Alves is gone.

579
01:04:30,171 --> 01:04:31,735
We gotta find Laurie.

580
01:04:32,152 --> 01:04:33,195
All right, listen.

581
01:04:34,759 --> 01:04:36,845
Why don't you check the East wing again?

582
01:04:37,053 --> 01:04:37,992
All right?

583
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:43,518
And if you don't find anyone, I want you to
get into your car and drive out to the sheriff's station.
Get somebody out of here.

584
01:04:44,874 --> 01:04:45,604
All right?

585
01:04:47,793 --> 01:04:48,628
Ok.

586
01:04:49,045 --> 01:04:49,566
Ok.

587
01:04:49,775 --> 01:04:50,922
I'll keep looking.

588
01:05:11,463 --> 01:05:12,402
Hello?

589
01:05:45,769 --> 01:05:46,916
Jesus.

590
01:08:32,498 --> 01:08:33,540
Laurie!

591
01:08:37,607 --> 01:08:38,546
Laurie.

592
01:08:38,963 --> 01:08:40,214
Laurie wait!

593
01:08:43,655 --> 01:08:45,010
Wait Laurie ...

594
01:13:26,959 --> 01:13:28,836
He didn't believe me and now they're dead.

595
01:13:29,878 --> 01:13:31,338
I'm sorry.

596
01:13:31,547 --> 01:13:33,006
Don't feel sorry for me.

597
01:13:33,528 --> 01:13:35,613
Feel sorry for that little town back there.

598
01:13:36,135 --> 01:13:38,012
It'll be years before they forget this.

599
01:13:40,097 --> 01:13:42,912
Dr. Loomis, I think there's something else
you should know.

600
01:13:43,642 --> 01:13:46,353
You see the blackboard
back there in the Elementary school?

601
01:13:46,666 --> 01:13:47,813
Yea?

602
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:50,107
In order to appease the gods,

603
01:13:50,212 --> 01:13:54,174
the druid priests ... held ... fire ... rituals.

604
01:13:54,382 --> 01:13:57,302
Prisoners of war, criminals, the insane ...

605
01:13:57,406 --> 01:13:58,658
animals ...

606
01:13:58,970 --> 01:13:59,909
were ...

607
01:14:00,952 --> 01:14:02,307
burned alive

608
01:14:02,411 --> 01:14:04,080
in baskets.

609
01:14:04,601 --> 01:14:09,189
By observing the way they died, the druids believed,
they could see omens of the future.

610
01:14:10,962 --> 01:14:14,090
2000 years later we've come no further.

611
01:14:15,654 --> 01:14:17,114
Samhain isn't ...

612
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:18,887
evil spirits.

613
01:14:20,034 --> 01:14:22,640
It isn't goblins, ghosts or witches.

614
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,707
it's the unconscious mind.

615
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:31,504
We're all afraid of the dark inside ourselves.

616
01:14:33,693 --> 01:14:35,987
Dr. Loomis, please listen to me.

617
01:14:36,092 --> 01:14:40,052
There's a file on Michael Myers, that nobody knew about.
- I've seen everything. - No.

618
01:14:40,156 --> 01:14:44,327
No. It was hidden.
Sealed by the court after his parents were killed.

619
01:14:45,161 --> 01:14:50,375
Now after the Governor heard what happened tonight,
he authorized Dr. Rogers to open it.

620
01:14:50,584 --> 01:14:51,835
What file?

621
01:14:53,295 --> 01:14:54,546
It isn't fair.

622
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:57,153
They should've allowed you to examine everything.

623
01:14:58,508 --> 01:14:59,551
That girl ...

624
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,305
that Strode girl, that's Michael Myers sister.

625
01:15:04,765 --> 01:15:06,016
She was born ...

626
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,893
2 years before he was commited.

627
01:15:07,997 --> 01:15:11,855
Two years after ... his parents died
and she was adopted by the Strodes.

628
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:18,112
They requested, that the records be sealed
in order to protect the family. - Jeez, don't you see,
what he's doing here in Haddonfield?

629
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:21,553
He killed one sister fifteen years ago.
Now he's trying to kill the other!

630
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:25,411
Tonight after I shot him, where did they take her?

631
01:15:25,828 --> 01:15:26,871
The clinic.

632
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:29,477
Clinic where? Do you know this area well?

633
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:30,624
A little bit.

634
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:34,170
Where's the hospital located?
- Dr. Loomis we're under orders from the Governor!

635
01:15:34,378 --> 01:15:36,464
It's back around Seventeen about three miles.

636
01:15:36,568 --> 01:15:38,236
Turn this car around now!

637
01:15:38,341 --> 01:15:40,218
I can't do that. I've got orders.

638
01:15:40,426 --> 01:15:43,346
Those orders have changed!
- Dr. Loomis!

639
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:45,640
Doctor, you're getting yourself into a lot of trouble.

640
01:15:45,744 --> 01:15:49,081
What is your fellows usually do?
Fire a warning shot, right?

641
01:16:23,697 --> 01:16:24,532
Jimmy?

642
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:35,063
It's all right.

643
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:37,253
We're ...

644
01:16:37,774 --> 01:16:39,651
Ok, we're gonna get out of here.

645
01:16:51,017 --> 01:16:52,268
I think, I think ...

646
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:51,912
I ought to handcuff you to the wheel,
but I have a feeling I'm gonna need you in there.

647
01:17:52,017 --> 01:17:53,164
Can I trust you?

648
01:17:54,206 --> 01:17:55,562
What have I got to loose ...

649
01:17:55,666 --> 01:17:57,022
except my job?

650
01:17:58,690 --> 01:17:59,941
I need help ...

651
01:18:02,861 --> 01:18:04,008
Help ...

652
01:18:05,155 --> 01:18:06,719
Help ... me.

653
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:10,784
HELP ME!!

654
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:20,898
Go and check all the rooms down there.

655
01:18:21,002 --> 01:18:22,045
Go on!

656
01:18:22,149 --> 01:18:24,339
Dr. Loomis.
- You stay with me and shut up.

657
01:18:58,019 --> 01:18:59,166
HELP!

658
01:19:01,982 --> 01:19:02,920
HELP!

659
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:06,466
HELP!!

660
01:19:07,717 --> 01:19:08,760
HELP!!

661
01:19:15,433 --> 01:19:16,476
HELP!!

662
01:19:19,395 --> 01:19:20,855
PLEASE!

663
01:19:21,064 --> 01:19:22,732
PLEASE!

664
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:25,235
PLEASE!

665
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:29,823
Come on, get in!

666
01:20:04,544 --> 01:20:05,482
Stop!

667
01:20:05,691 --> 01:20:06,420
He is dead!

668
01:20:06,525 --> 01:20:07,672
No, he's not. Look at him!

669
01:20:07,776 --> 01:20:08,923
He's still breathing.

670
01:20:11,217 --> 01:20:12,051
Ok.

671
01:20:14,345 --> 01:20:17,161
There's a two way radio over in the marshall's car.
I want you to go outside.

672
01:20:17,265 --> 01:20:19,246
Get on that radio and get help!

673
01:20:19,976 --> 01:20:21,227
Now wait a minute.

674
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:23,730
I'm the only one authorized to use that.

675
01:20:23,834 --> 01:20:24,773
Move!

676
01:20:28,943 --> 01:20:30,299
I'm sorry I left you.

677
01:20:30,925 --> 01:20:31,967
Are you all right?

678
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:37,181
Why won't he die?

679
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:41,456
Get away from him!

680
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,020
But he's stopped breathing!

681
01:20:43,229 --> 01:20:44,063
No!

682
01:21:50,796 --> 01:21:52,464
Unit calling. Identify.

683
01:21:52,568 --> 01:21:56,218
Marion Chambers with Dr. Loomis at the clinic. He's here.

684
01:21:56,322 --> 01:21:59,138
10-4. Unit calling. Indentify suspect.

685
01:21:59,242 --> 01:22:02,474
Michael Myers! Just get your ass over here!

686
01:22:32,609 --> 01:22:34,590
Take that gun. Come on!
- No.

687
01:22:34,799 --> 01:22:35,842
Take it.

688
01:22:36,676 --> 01:22:37,719
Take it!

689
01:23:30,062 --> 01:23:31,104
Michael?!

690
01:23:47,788 --> 01:23:49,039
Michael STOP!

691
01:25:20,693 --> 01:25:23,092
Get out. get out. Go on.

692
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:24,760
Go on. Get out.

693
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:27,367
Get out NOW!

694
01:25:35,604 --> 01:25:37,481
It's time ...
Michael.

695
01:26:56,414 --> 01:26:57,561
What's the count?

696
01:26:57,769 --> 01:26:58,604
Ten.

697
01:26:59,334 --> 01:27:00,585
So far.

698
01:27:10,386 --> 01:27:14,349
Do you have any firsthand information ...
- Just leave me alone. -
... about what happened inside the hospital? - Excuse us.

699
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:17,998
Can't I ride in front?

700
01:27:18,207 --> 01:27:19,980
No Laurie.
I'm sorry, I have to put you in back.

701
01:27:20,084 --> 01:27:20,709
Are you ready?

702
01:27:20,814 --> 01:27:22,169
Watch out for your feet.

703
01:27:22,795 --> 01:27:25,610
She's now being assisted out of the wheelchair ...
- Drop your feet carefull.

704
01:27:25,715 --> 01:27:27,696
... and into the ambulance.

705
01:27:28,739 --> 01:27:29,990
Big step.

706
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:31,345
Big step ...

707
01:27:32,492 --> 01:27:33,431
Ok.

708
01:27:34,369 --> 01:27:36,350
Keep the leg up.
We'll have you out of here in a second.

709
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:40,834
Ok.
