1
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,130
That's the city

2
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,360
A very ancient site round three hot springs

3
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,360
It's well known that the Georgian architects

4
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,900
used occult principle to lay out the city

5
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,700
It's diameter deliberately matches that of Stonehenge

6
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,630
We discovered there's a hidden level under the streets

7
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,900
a secret from the past that they deliberately kept hidden

8
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,530
It has an occult significance

9
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,500
We will infect you

10
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:31,860
Half beast half man
We will infect you

11
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,860
Half beast half man

12
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,160
Hi... I'm Andy... film student...

13
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,500
And this is footage I'm putting together of my Landlord's business –

14
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Occult Angel.

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,660
Cool, This is Jack's house. I rent a room here...

16
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,930
he's rented it to students ever since his wife left him

17
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah well It started to change about a month ago...

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,660
Yeah well It started to change about a month ago...

19
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,400
I just started getting more calls

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,430
OK... So last week when I went to a case with Jack
I just started getting more calls

21
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,530
OK... So last week when I went to a case with Jack

22
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:15,630
but then... well this...
OK... So last week when I went to a case with Jack

23
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,300
but then... well this...

24
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,030
So here I've had to disguise Mrs B.

25
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,030
That's what Jack wanted...

26
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,160
So this is what happened when we got inside.

27
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,960
Then sometimes a kind of cry.

28
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,000
Like a baby or something
then sometimes a kind of cry.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Like a baby or something

30
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,730
Jack does this weird listening

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,860
no, no...

32
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,860
yeah, this feels more interesting

33
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,260
This is an older part of the house here... thicker walls

34
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,600
and the floor levels been raised...

35
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,530
This is weird... I don't like this.

36
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,530
That noise... is getting louder.

37
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,400
Turn it off!

38
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,730
It looks like a big chunk of plaster fell off.

39
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,960
And there's markings on it.

40
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,400
Something got hold of me

41
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,130
All I could see in my minds eye was the serpent

42
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,130
So this is a fetish.

43
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,230
And you can see this is the outline of the horned serpent

44
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,730
It's very unusual about the horned serpent

45
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:42,760
Not really sure what this symbol is or what it means

Not really sure what this symbol is or what it means

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,330
and this looks like hair

48
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,400
and this could possibly be skin tissue

and this could possibly be skin tissue

50
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,960
Lady who?

51
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,160
She says something killed her dog...

52
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,600
So, this is Lady O's

53
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:45,630
She was... well, a bit whoozy
So, this is Lady O's

54
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,830
She was... well, a bit whoozy

55
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,460
Sorry. She has to touch things to help tune in.

56
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,360
That is Lola, she Jack's niece

57
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,460
and she's here to help Jack out

58
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,360
Ready?

59
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,800
This is definitely and older part of the cellar

60
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,060
older than the house above.

61
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,060
Something.

62
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,000
Hang on, I'm putting the night vision on

63
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,800
So what's happening?

64
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,630
This has been here for a long time.

65
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,330
See this arch has been filled in with breeze block

66
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,330
What do you think Lola?

67
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:36,800
Well, it's what I'm here for.

68
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,400
What's going on?

69
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,600
Lola!

70
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,360
Heuuurrrrrnnnnnn!

71
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,600
Get out!
Heuuurrrrrnnnnnn!

72
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,530
Get out!

73
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,130
Lola! LOLA!

74
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,800
What was it?

75
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,430
No, no...

76
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,400
Be still! BE STILL!

77
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,200
It stank of meat.

78
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,960
We're in the workroom having a debrief... and Jack is worried.

79
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,930
Yeah good reason 'cos this is definitely getting worse.

80
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,630
It had a real... strength!

81
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,630
Explain what that means.

82
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,860
I... I couldn't stop it... It was using the doorway...

83
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,530
What?

84
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,130
But it's getting worse... and it's got something to do with this symbol.

85
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,960
So we checked out all the different symbols using snakes or serpents.

86
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,330
Yes well snakes serpents and dragons all get mixed up

87
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,200
and they can signify all sorts of things.

88
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,960
And Jack found this...

89
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,160
The horned serpent is uniquely associated with an ancient Celtic god

90
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,360
called Cernunnos

91
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,700
and the interesting bit is that...

92
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,230
Cernunnos, half stag, half man

93
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,360
is also known in Southern England as Herne.

94
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Heuuurrrrrnnnnnn!

95
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,660
You think that was what she was saying?

96
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,900
Something spoke through her... and it really brutal and primeval

97
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,400
So, what's the significance?

98
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,130
I'm not sure

99
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,400
Yeah but you know about weirdy stuff like this.

100
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,630
Andy I'm getting really hacked off with your attitude

101
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,530
Why don't you just stop now

102
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,530
Sorry Jack... I was only...

103
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,160
Just Stop!

104
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,830
So Jack got a bit narked with me...

105
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,260
But he's had another call... and agreed for me to come along...

106
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,560
I'm gonna try and keep my mouth shut.

107
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Sounds good to me.

108
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,130
That's the pub manager

109
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,400
We’ve agreed not to reveal his face or the name of the pub

110
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,900
It's usually in the evenings... when I'm cashing up... I sit at the desk.

111
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,260
Here?

112
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:52,930
Then the room will suddenly get cold...
and then I feel it... usually on my back...

113
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,930
like a hand.

114
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,860
It's not a draught or anything like that... it's like a hand.

115
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,130
It's not a spirit... it's something else...

116
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,330
It's coming from there...

117
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,900
It's locked... I... I was told not to open it... but...
I know where the key is...

118
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,260
Could you get it for us?

119
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,130
Hey can you feel that?

120
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,430
Yeah... It's gone really cold.

121
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,430
Go on...

122
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,630
Wow...

123
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,760
The horned serpent again.

124
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,630
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

125
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,630
Who are these people? Get out!

126
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,160
Uh... I asked them

127
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,130
We haven't done anything!

128
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,560
And put that camera down.

129
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,830
Hey!

130
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,760
I told you not to open that door!

131
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,730
What was that all about?

132
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,700
Let's go... just go...

133
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,100
I'm a bit skeptical about this paranormal stuff...

134
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,930
but that bloke who burst in and told us to clear out,
he was real enough...

135
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,260
So I went back later and talked to the pub manager

136
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,060
and he gave us some more information

137
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,900
turns out the guys name is Crouch and he’s the pub owner

138
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,400
So... that's where Crouch's office is...

139
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,000
I hung around a bit earlier...

140
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
as far as I could tell he just rents one room...

141
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,030
Now I guess I just wait... stakeout!

142
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,400
Well this is boring.

143
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
That’s Crouch!

144
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,500
Ok, so um, this is it!

145
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,660
I bloody lost him!

146
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,400
Ah, there he is... locked on!

147
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,860
Hey, this is cool

148
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,300
This is weird. Suddenly all those seagulls went crazy

149
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,500
and started swirling about over Crouch.

150
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,900
And he keeps looking up at them

151
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,260
Ok, he's going into the church

152
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,130
He's looking at the seagulls again

153
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,930
What's he doing?

154
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,500
He's crazy!

155
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,130
He's gone into the library...

156
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,160
There he is.

157
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,060
OK... Crouch has just gone out...

158
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,030
He's left his stuff on the desk

159
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,360
so I'm going to have a quick look

160
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,330
Shit, Crouch!

161
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,660
Crouch finished at the Library...

162
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,560
I was just thinking about giving up when he came out again...

163
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
OK. This is weird...

164
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,030
That's Lady O's house where we were the other day

165
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,600
Oh shit.

166
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,560
OK, I'm going to follow him

167
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,060
I can't see a bloody thing

168
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
What?

169
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,160
What's he doing?

170
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,230
He's looking at something

171
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,860
This is weird...

172
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,860
He's weird.

173
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,430
He's going to see me...

174
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,160
I had to get behind a car

175
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,800
...I knew he'd be looking...

176
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,960
And you know I've just thought of something...

177
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,630
Lady O's house... it's number thirty-one!

178
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,200
Think it's time I went and saw Jack.

179
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,160
Yes I knew about John Wood...

180
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
There are two of them father and son...

181
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,530
and I knew that they had an interest in the occult...

182
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,330
and I knew that they built the Circus and Royal Crescent

183
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,430
on occult principles

184
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,130
So who's the Thomas Jelly bloke?

185
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,560
He was another builder contemporary with Wood...

186
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,730
I don't know much about him...

187
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,400
seems he had an interest in the occult too

188
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,330
So what do we do now?

189
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,860
Uh... back to Lady O.

190
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,360
So here we are again.

191
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,330
Oi, I can't see the number, you're in the way

192
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,060
Lady O seemed quite keen to talk...

193
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,960
said she knew about Thomas Jelly.

194
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,560
So Crouch was kneeling by that stone

195
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,900
I need to get closer

196
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,500
A horned serpent... and the number '5'

197
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,200
What's it mean?

198
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,160
Ah!

199
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,400
What?
Ah!

200
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,860
What?

201
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,100
The same thing!

202
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,360
What thing?

203
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,330
Shut up Andy

204
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,330
What thing?

205
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,960
Not now!

206
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,360
Lady O's family have owned this house since

207
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,300
since the old part was built by

208
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,700
by none other than Thomas Jelly in 1758

209
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,700
and so they have all the deeds and that kind of stuff

210
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,060
most of it is just plans and accounts...

211
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,300
but there is this letter...

212
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:47,200
OK... It's not clear who the letter is to but it's signed IM ...

213
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,460
anyway it says...

214
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,400
Sir, following our investigation

215
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,560
I have been able to draw certain conclusions...

216
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,400
that there are six gates built by the monks of the abbey...

217
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,560
two I believe were damaged severely in an earthquake

218
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,260
that shook this city and much of England in 1275.

219
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:12,230
In deed I have found some evidence of manifestations at this time.

220
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:17,260
Moreover the gates seem to be holding since the works at St. Michaels

221
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,060
We also look to your support in regards to sealing the gate

222
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,730
below the church of St. James.

223
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:30,430
Sir, I implore your pardon for these occurrences

224
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,860
But it is only in the last year that

225
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,200
we have to realise the nature and extremity of our dark enemy.

226
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,700
So we were chewing over this letter

227
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,860
wondering what it meant by six gates

228
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,800
when Lady O said

229
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,600
Have you looked at the plan on the other piece of paper?

230
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,160
And this is what we found

231
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,260
with the horned serpent again!

232
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,300
And then Jack saw a pattern
with the horned serpent again!

233
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,830
And then Jack saw a pattern

234
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,900
I mean these are the six gates... but they're not city gates...

235
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,860
one... don't know, but two would be St. Michael's chapel,

236
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,230
three is St. Jame's church...

237
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,330
Four is the pub... it had the four

238
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,000
Five is here at Lady O's...

239
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,330
and then six would be St. Michael's on Walcot Street!

240
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:23,730
So what are these gates for?

241
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,400
So we have this rough plan which schematically shows the six gates.

242
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,100
Now the fact that there are two churches dedicated to St. Michael's

243
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,400
interesting especially as he was famous for slaying serpents.

244
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,930
So the two St. Michael churches are where we're heading next

245
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,130
I love this spot... The history that is here...

246
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:03,530
You have to imagine that two thousand
years ago this was a steaming swamp

247
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,660
A sacred site for the Celts...
then the Roman's turned up and built their temple

248
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,860
collecting the hot springs into sacred pools... or Roman Baths.

249
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,530
There are three hot springs

250
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,200
Up there is the main one and the site of the Roman Temple...

251
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,530
The second one is over there

252
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,130
See the spring is underneath this building...

253
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,900
and right beside it... is a chapel dedicated to St. Michael.

254
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,600
St.Michael the destroyer of serpents...

255
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,360
perhaps pagan serpents

256
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,260
associated with a significant heathen spring.

257
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,700
Anyway, let's take a look inside the church

258
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,960
So... it's a little bland in here now

259
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,830
Obviously nothing left of the earlier chapel that stood here

260
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,830
Lola, anything?

261
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,830
Nothing.

262
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,960
We carried on to the next St. Michael's

263
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,860
So we've just come down Upper Borough walls there

264
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,560
and now we're standing at the site of the medieval North Gate

265
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,230
and outside would have been fields with a church

266
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,330
and a small thatched roof.

267
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,430
This St Michael's was a disappointment as well.

268
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,400
The Victorians had completely rebuilt it

269
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,200
We found nothing inside the churches...

270
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,530
so we thought we'd have a scan round to see if we can find gate one

271
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,160
We checked the obelisk in Queen's square. Nothing.

272
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,760
We carried on scanning round... and then I realised

273
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,730
Hey... wait up... This is where Crouch's office is!

274
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,200
Now, we think Crouch's office maybe

275
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,030
over or near Gate number one.

276
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:36,360
OK, we were just wondering what to do when Crouch came out.

277
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,130
Um, he didn't see us...

278
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:43,900
But we thought maybe we should have a snoop around.

279
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,930
So we've come down to the basement

280
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,930
to meet Jim the security guard

281
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,500
do you mind if Lola has a listen for a minute?

282
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Be my guest.

283
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,630
What do you think Lola?

284
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:41,260
That's where the gate is... in that room, it must be...

285
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:55,360
OK... so we just got back to Jack's and we found this.

286
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
What's it mean?

287
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,460
I would say someone is trying to scare us...

288
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,530
So who wrote the bloody message?

289
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,530
Crouch, has to be.

290
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,860
Or some one working with him.

291
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,930
He may not be working alone... we don't know that.

292
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,430
Do you think he really was threatening us?

293
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,430
Maybe we should call the police?

294
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:22,730
No... But it shows Crouch or someone knows where we are.

295
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:27,230
We'd better be careful... keep an eye out.

296
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,300
Jack has just received this message.

297
00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:00,200
OK... We're on our way to Crouch's office to meet Jim.

298
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Turns out that not only did Crouch lay
into Jim for letting us have a snoop round

299
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,860
but he also went into his basement room and

300
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:14,030
about half an hour later Jim heard this weird animal yell.

301
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,100
Said it freaked him out...

302
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,330
and then Crouch sort of stumbled out of the room and ran outside...

303
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,500
So Jim wants some explanations.

304
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,160
That serious?

305
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
Yes... that serious.

306
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,030
Hang on, putting the night vision on

307
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,830
Wow! Look at this Andy

308
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,530
This is old!

309
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,630
Listen!

310
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,930
Sounds like running water.

311
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,160
Can you feel the air? ... It's warm.

312
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,260
It smells of rotten meat.

313
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,130
I can't smell it.

314
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,700
Andy, look...

315
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:22,200
Gate One, Conduit to Stanton Drew

316
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,830
Compton Dando, King's Circus

317
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,730
Draconis Extinctor...

318
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:34,030
It's something do with a dragon... or serpent. Destroying the serpent.

319
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,230
What is that?

320
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,100
It's coming.

321
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,630
What?

322
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,560
It's coming!

323
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,460
Come on we've got to go!

324
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,860
What is that?

325
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,730
COME ON!

326
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,500
I just... I've got to see

327
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,430
Come on we've got to go now!

328
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,630
Come on move it!

329
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,800
What was that all about?

330
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,830
I don't know

331
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,060
but it's really powerful,
we just got to stay away until we know how to deal with it!

332
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,660
Wha?

333
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,660
And don't tell Jim, OK?

334
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,730
Why not?

335
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,530
Just do as I tell you and turn that bloody camera off!

336
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:39,300
So we're just going over stuff, starting with Gate One.

337
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,500
Look... I know you don't experience this like we do

338
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,830
but there was something in that tunnel that was more...

339
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,900
threatening than anything I've ever experienced in my life

340
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,900
You mean a spirit?

341
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,030
Yes... but... it wasn't just one spirit...

342
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,030
It was different

343
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,830
It was really malevolent

344
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,100
And this is what the gate is for...

345
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,100
to keep this thing locked up?

346
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:13,230
Yeah... but it's been there since the Eighteenth century...
or even before...

347
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,960
Look Andy...

348
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,860
Maybe we should look at what was written on the tablet

349
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,830
I've got it typed up here

350
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,300
It's implying that Gate One...

351
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,160
is at the end of some line that begins at Stanton Drew.

352
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,700
Stanton Drew is a huge stone circle just west of Bath

353
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,660
I've been there lots of times. It's huge but somehow hardly known...

354
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,030
Compton Dando is a village halfway between.

355
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,800
There used to be a statue embedded in the wall of the church

356
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,730
which was taken from the altar in the Roman temple...

357
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:00,800
right by the hot spring here in Bath. Nobody knows how or why...

358
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,630
The royal circus we know was built by Wood, father and son

359
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:08,700
and it's diameter deliberately matches that of stonehenge.

360
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:13,900
It has an occult significance supposedly signifying the sun...

361
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,930
Look at these, all round the circus, deliberately placed by Wood.

362
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,730
Maybe Woods and Thomas Jelly knew about the six gates

363
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,260
and whatever is locked behind it

364
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,300
So, we didn't find anything, but on the way back

365
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,900
Jack wanted to explore a place we'd seen near Compton Dando

366
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,560
It's called Fairy Hill

367
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,930
Close by something called Drakes Well

368
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,330
He said he had a feeling about it

369
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,000
Turned out he was right

370
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,600
What are we looking for Jack?

371
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,330
I'm not sure. Maybe a spring...

372
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,700
Just heard a weird sound

373
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:38,000
Like an animal... but weird

374
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,700
We're a bit nervous to be honest

375
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,330
Did you hear the noise?

376
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,330
Weird!

377
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,800
Seen this Andy? It's the spring

378
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,960
There! Bloody Hell! Freaky!

379
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,000
Shit!

380
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,760
What the hell was that?

381
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,030
Now St James is destroyed he will escape! ... And you...

382
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,560
will be marked!

383
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,960
What do you mean? Who will escape?

384
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,160
Ha! You don't know?

385
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,100
Just keep away

386
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:12,330
There's only one way to deal with this! Keep away!

387
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,700
What the hell?

388
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:34,530
He was pretty angry... but he was scared too.

389
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,330
OK. So Crouch said a couple of key things.

390
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:45,760
Now that St.James is destroyed he will escape...

391
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,000
So this is St. Jame's church

392
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,800
a big full on church right in the middle of Bath and then...

393
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,560
OK... this is where St. James church used to be...

394
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,030
but it was demolished in the nineteen fifties and now...

395
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,400
the site is being built over

396
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,000
St James... founded by King Alfred the Great...

397
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
rebuilt by Thomas Jelly... now it's gone.

398
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,800
There's been a burial ground here since medieval times...

399
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,730
underneath this building site

400
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,300
All gone.

401
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:34,130
Now St James is destroyed he will escape and you... will be MARKED!

402
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,300
I've just been editing...

403
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,860
and I heard a sound from downstairs like a girl screaming...

404
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:57,230
but I'm the only one here... Jack and Lola have gone out.

405
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:02,600
So I'm just going to have a look downstairs to see if anyone's there

406
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,630
There!

407
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,100
Lola?

408
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,730
This is bloody weird.

409
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,760
Bloody light's gone.

410
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,760
Lola, are you there?

411
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:46,430
No! ... That was... that was real...

412
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,230
Shit!

413
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,360
It's really freaking me out

414
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,260
What was that?

415
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,760
There's something out there

416
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,060
Oh my God!

417
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,630
Don't know what went on there...

418
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,930
I must admit I was scared...

419
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:47,500
But if I don't believe in ghosts... then what am I scared of?

420
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,460
It's like, it can't hurt me...

421
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,930
But... I was scared...

422
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,500
the thought of a dead person's spirit...

423
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,960
kind of messes with your mind a bit...

424
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,360
It's like... trying to get into my mind...

425
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,900
like a kind of madness

426
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,900
like a kind of madness

427
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,130
Madness

428
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,700
The spirit really scared Jack.

429
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,830
I'm getting worried because the... influence is spreading...

430
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,560
and getting more powerful.

431
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:32,360
And both Lola and I have the same feeling of foreboding

432
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,030
We think it's blood

433
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:45,130
There's no way of telling what or who it can get to...

434
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:47,100
You will be marked!

435
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,130
So, it's getting to us... and Jack's had enough...

436
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:54,130
we're going to find Crouch and talk to him.

437
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:54,230
OK... so we wanted to go and see Crouch
we're going to find Crouch and talk to him.

438
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:58,630
OK... so we wanted to go and see Crouch

439
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,360
but he wasn't there, the receptionist said

440
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,300
then we asked to see Jim the security guard but he's off sick...

441
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:12,760
So... I'm going to break into Crouch's
store room and go through the gate.

442
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,460
I need to find out what's there

443
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,300
Andy's agreed to come with me...

444
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,600
But Lola's going to stay outside. I can't afford to risk Lola again.

445
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:32,960
So Lola's going to watch out if the
receptionist goes to the loo or something

446
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,130
Ok, it's clear

447
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,600
alright?

448
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:55,160
If this goes wrong... get out as quick as you can... understand?

449
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,830
Ready?

450
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,530
Just this bolt holding it...

451
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,060
Oh, it's stiff

452
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,530
Herne... the god... no... It goes on for miles!

453
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,160
What was that?

454
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,060
OK? Let's get moving

455
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:11,030
Andy, come on... keep up

456
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,600
This is weird

457
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:29,900
I don't like this

458
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:35,360
You alright? I think there is something up ahead

459
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,160
There's a staircase going up

460
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,230
just there...

461
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,800
Oh no...

462
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:26,130
Herne... the god... no...

463
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,700
What... in there?

464
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,130
Do we open it?

465
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,030
The lids moving

466
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:41,460
I can smell it now... rotten meat.

467
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,130
What do we do?

468
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:47,330
They’re coming down the stairs

469
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,360
Quick go back down the corridor a bit.

470
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,360
Come on!

471
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,500
Muttered incantations echoing.

472
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:56,960
Shit... that was...

473
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:00,600
Oh my god

474
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,000
Oh my god that was something...

475
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,100
This is bad

476
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,730
Shhh... he's just ahead...

477
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:37,000
Something bad happened back there...

478
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,060
There's something wrong...

479
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:44,530
Careful, we're near the gate

480
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,600
It's open

481
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,860
Yeah, it's clear

482
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,500
He's still moving

483
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,300
Did someone just come past?

484
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,530
Yes... Mr. Crouch

485
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:22,460
Has he gone outside?

486
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,400
Yes... what's going on?

487
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,760
Crouch just came out... He's over there!

488
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:34,760
Crouch!... He looks bloody weird...

489
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,260
Crouch! Wait!

490
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:44,260
Crouch... you alright? What happened?

491
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,260
Jack!

492
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,560
You alright?

493
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,700
Andy get back... it's dangerous!

494
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,230
That not Crouch.

495
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:57,300
What do you mean it's not Crouch?

496
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,300
It's taken him.

497
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,230
Let it go… let it go…

498
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:29,800
So Jack... the big question... What went on back there?

499
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,560
Well... We found a chamber

500
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:39,330
with a sarcophagus in it with... Herne on it.

501
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:44,260
Crouch cam in and did some kind of ritual...

502
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:49,960
then something came out of the sarcophagus and took hold of Crouch...

503
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,860
That wasn't Crouch

504
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:56,460
It had the same hatred inside it

505
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,060
So what do we do?

506
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,960
Be on our guard... whatever happened...

507
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,400
So it's been six weeks

508
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,460
there's no sign of Crouch

509
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:20,900
His office is closed, phone is dead... there's no trace of him

510
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:26,000
So we were thinking... that it might all have gone away...

511
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,130
But... Then this happened...

512
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,630
Somebody pushed it through the letterbox.

513
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,860
So we don't know...

514
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:50,430
whatever that was... inside Crouch...

515
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:54,930
It's out there. It's out there somewhere.

516
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,400
We uncovered an occult mystery in the city of Bath

517
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,730
The Entity, the Demon has broken free

518
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,760
It's been over a year since we filmed any of the Occult Angel stuff

519
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,960
and really I haven't had much to do with it...

520
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,930
for various reasons –

521
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:33,800
I moved out of Jack's house,

522
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,830
Um... Lola left...

523
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:42,530
and... also it scared me.

524
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:48,330
So Andy has finished university and has got a pretty good graphics job

525
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:50,600
but I’ve asked him to film again…

526
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,060
to explain how there’s been a significant change.

527
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:59,430
First off I had to get out of my house
because we received what was a threat...

528
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:03,260
But since then we received this...

529
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,700
You see, this letter is different – not threatening like the last one

530
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,300
more like a clue.

531
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:13,400
So I checked out this ELA organisation

532
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,300
and couldn't find anything at all

533
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,860
until last week when I realised...

534
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,430
So I'm here at Lacock

535
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:28,700
which is national trust building about fifteen miles outside of Bath

536
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,400
Originally a 13th century monastery...

537
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,100
and guess who founded it...

538
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,860
So there you are E. L. A.... Ela.

539
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,530
You can see that Lacock is on a line

540
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,500
A conduit…

541
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,360
A conduit… which leads to gate 5.

542
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,630
Just like the Stanton Drew Conduit leads to gate 1…

543
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,860
So nearby we found this.

544
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,630
Come and have a film up here Andy.

545
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,260
Oh!

546
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,900
Listen!

547
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:25,900
That sound again.

548
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:40,860
The Herne entity is near here...

549
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:45,000
I can feel it... it's the same uh...

550
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,260
What is that?

551
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,400
You are marked!

552
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,900
Wait a minute... turn it off

553
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,900
We have no idea who that figure was…

554
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,200
but it felt like we were being checked out.

555
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,030
And then over the following seasons…

556
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:12,460
always at Beltane and Samain…

557
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:15,100
we received more instructions.

558
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,700
Again they are like riddles.

559
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,060
Showing the connections with the Occult Gates.

560
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,430
Gate Four, Stonehenge ravaged

561
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,660
Marden destroyed by our enemies

562
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,430
Marsden was a massive henge

563
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:46,700
But most of it was destroyed in the Eighteenth Century.

564
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,200
And we found the signs

565
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:00,700
Clee is a beautiful, mysterious hill. South East of Bath.

566
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,560
Gate Two, St Michael’s to St. Michael’s

567
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,660
The conduit of the Tor is closed

568
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:22,130
This must be the famous Glastonbury Tor

569
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:27,600
The Saint Michael’s link is clear.

570
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,330
Gate 6. To the North are the Hwicce.

571
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:38,930
There was a kingdom to the North of Bath.

572
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:43,960
The land of the Hwicce. The people of witchcraft.

573
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,000
We felt we were being told to keep away.

574
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,830
The conduit at Horningsham remains.

575
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:55,200
This place is south of Bath… high on a hill

576
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,160
The Durotrigan Giant is our guardian.

577
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,630
I knew exactly what this meant...

578
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:14,030
The Cerne Abbas giant.

579
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:19,160
This ancient carving is in the heart of the land of the Durotriges.

580
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,100
A Celtic tribe.

581
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,800
The name links it with Cernunnos or Herne.

582
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,460
So, we visit each site… And there is always a symbol or a sign…

583
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:39,400
like we’re being lead towards something…

584
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,030
A conduit showing the connection with the occult gates

585
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:46,460
This last communication talks of pilgrimage…

586
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,500
and that’s what it felt like

587
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:01,500
A beautiful pilgrimage across the pagan
landscape of South West England.

588
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:22,000
But a pilgrimage has to lead somewhere…

589
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,500
When we got back from Cerne Abbas

590
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,200
this was on my computer.

591
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,630
Pilgrim. You have followed our riddles

592
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:40,260
and you desire more.

593
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:47,700
But, you cannot intervene without consequences.

594
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:51,530
Consider this before you choose.

595
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:17,860
We are the Nemeton... The dark enemy

596
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:21,300
We have revealed ourselves.

597
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:26,360
You have seen the demon

598
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:32,530
You saw it attack... and devour

599
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:36,630
Will you be chosen?

600
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,230
Or will you enter the path of sacrifice?

601
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,930
Tread carefully pilgrim.

602
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:02,300
Well, I realise we are playing with fire here…

603
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,260
Maybe we should just walk away and forget it...

604
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,760
But I can't... I can't stop now!

605
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:16,930
Andy is … upset by this. You know he’s not happy…

606
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:19,130
but he’s going to stick with me… Yeah?

607
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:20,360
Yeah...

608
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:24,060
OK, we’ll lets just see what happens.

609
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:33,560
Madness...

610
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,400
Like a kind of madness...

611
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,700
Madness

612
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,860
When Herne takes your breath

613
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,660
Madness will crawl through your soul

614
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:56,330
Andy are you OK?

615
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,160
You’re scaring me…

616
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,130
You don’t… seem the same.

617
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:05,160
Maybe you should get some help…

618
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:09,000
Andy… this is, serious…

619
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:13,330
Mr. Roberts. You have chosen.

620
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:16,360
We will infect you.

621
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,000
You will serve us.

622
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:41,330
So it’s been a few years since Andy made the videos, a long time…

623
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:44,700
and there’s… been quite a bit of bad stuff

624
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:48,060
Especially for Andy. He’s not been well.

625
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:54,630
I've been trying to keep my head down…

626
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:04,330
But over this period of time I’ve been receiving communications…

627
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,060
I don't know who they're from

628
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:12,930
The letters never say anything clear.

629
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,900
Until this last one arrived, and it said this.

630
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:26,500
So a man rang, I don't know who, just a voice…

631
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,960
and gave us a location

632
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,600
So we’re going there now.

633
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:36,400
I don’t … I’m scared. But we need to know... so...

634
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:43,600
OK. We are here at the location.

635
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,560
All I can say is that we're near the Cerne giant in Dorset

636
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,630
Look at all those Rooks!

637
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:59,130
They’re like an alarm… like sentinels.

638
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,430
Come on!

639
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,060
Looks like we’re expected

640
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:46,330
Look... Look! Over there...

641
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,300
Ok, this is it...

642
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,060
Careful...

643
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,360
There’s another one.

644
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,360
They’re all around us.

645
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:30,030
I don’t like this… it doesn’t feel safe…

646
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,130
Ok… We’ll go in.

647
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,800
You alright Andy?

648
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:16,300
To be chosen, or sacrificed.

649
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:22,360
Mr Andy Roberts was chosen…

650
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,800
And as our loyal servant...

651
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:37,030
he procured Mr. Jack Angel for sacrifice.

652
01:04:56,330 --> 01:05:00,900
You violated my sanctuary.

653
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:17,430
This is a warning for all who try to find us.

654
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,700
You have been traced

655
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,600
you are marked.

656
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:26,660
Look behind you...

657
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:34,060
Look behind you. Death is at your shoulder.
