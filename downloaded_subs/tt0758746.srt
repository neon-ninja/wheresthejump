1
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,567
No!

2
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,214
Come here. Come here now.

3
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:50,082
No.

4
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,626
You're the last one.

5
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,058
<i>I've killed all the others.</i>

6
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,700
It'll be easier for you
than it was for Jason.

7
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:00,631
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

8
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:04,467
You need to be punished
for what you did to him.

9
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:07,904
<i>I didn't do anything.
You let him drown.</i>

10
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:09,839
Jason was my son.

11
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:12,513
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

12
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:14,950
No. No.

13
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:17,318
<i>No. Please.</i>

14
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,419
You should have been watching him.

15
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:24,217
Every minute.

16
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,200
<i>Jason.</i>

17
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,542
<i>My special, special boy.</i>

18
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:23,413
<i>They must be punished, Jason,
for what they did to you.</i>

19
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:25,816
<i>For what they did to me.</i>

20
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,452
<i>Kill for Mother.</i>

21
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,273
I'm serious.

22
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:54,348
You gotta watch out for mountain lions.
They're all over.

23
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:57,179
Mountain lions?
We'll be fine. They're afraid of fire.

24
00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:59,446
Dude, shut the fuck up.
I'm calling bullshit.

25
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:00,953
Richie's gonna call bullshit.

26
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:03,092
Bullshit!
Richie's calling bullshit.

27
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:04,817
- I'm not bullshitting.
Bullshit.

28
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,053
You'll see when a mountain lion
comes out...

29
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,061
Dude, there's one right there!
- Nice try.

30
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,131
I am more afraid to be eaten
by mosquitoes.

31
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:15,965
Hey, you wanna slap that ass
one more time for Daddy?

32
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,903
- Did Daddy like that?
- Yeah, Daddy does like it. A lot.

33
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:22,737
Whitney? Where are you right now?

34
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:24,436
- I'm here.
- Are you?

35
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:27,447
I'm here. Right in the middle of nowhere.

36
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:31,950
Hey, are you reading that right?
I'm reading it right.

37
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:34,654
Come on, Pizarro, let's go.
- Where are we going?

38
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:37,190
These are heavy and it's hot.
Where are we?

39
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,663
Dude, we are way the fuck off.

40
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,166
- No, we're not, act...
- Yes.

41
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:50,500
No, we're not. Not everything
shows up on GPS, Richie.

42
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:53,233
A sign said there was a mine here.
Did that come up?

43
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:55,309
No. We're close, I think.

44
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:58,038
You think? Dude, you don't know
how to use this thing.

45
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,205
It's almost dark.
Do you know where it is?

46
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,011
Look, I didn't plant this shit,
Richie, okay?

47
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:06,121
I got this tip from a secondhand source.
We should be close.

48
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:08,223
Look, we're gonna stop here.

49
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,986
Tomorrow morning, you and me, we get up
at dawn. We go, we find the crop.

50
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:14,857
We cut down as much as we can.
We ditch it in the truck.

51
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,222
- Back here before breakfast, okay?
- Hey.

52
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,698
- Guys. Guys.
- Nobody knows a thing.

53
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:22,565
There's a perfect spot here.
It's already been cleared.

54
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,572
Perfect. We'll camp here.

55
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,269
Hey. Do you know how much money
we're gonna make selling this weed?

56
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:33,313
- A lot of fucking money.
- Yeah, okay? So listen to me. Relax.

57
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:35,041
- I am. You wanna know why?
- Why?

58
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,015
- You know what rich people do?
- What?

59
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:39,586
They relax. You need to fucking relax.

60
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,452
I need to relax?
You need to relax.

61
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,768
Hey, guys. Guys.

62
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:59,137
I just found some broken-down cabins
over there. It's gotta be the old camp.

63
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,172
Who wants to go check it out?

64
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:03,437
Is this all we brought to drink?
No Heineken?

65
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,841
Fuck that Euro shit.

66
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:08,814
This is Pabst Blue American Ribbon,
my friend.

67
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:12,318
You do realize this camp
was closed down, like, 20 years ago?

68
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,152
Some woman, she went fucking nuts.

69
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:16,916
Killed all these counselors.

70
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:19,527
Blamed them for her son's drowning.
He was like...

71
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:22,220
...deformed or retarded or something.

72
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:23,990
Really?

73
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,632
Mom got hers.

74
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:29,466
Apparently there was one survivor.

75
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,300
This girl...

76
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,704
...she cut that lady's head off
with a machete.

77
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:36,276
It gets weirder.

78
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:38,175
I'm sure it does.

79
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:42,010
Her son, Jason...

80
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:45,517
...he came back.

81
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,856
He was actually there.

82
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,891
He watched his mom being beheaded.

83
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,732
A friend of mine,
he went to camp around here...

84
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,765
Oh, jeez.
- He went to camp around here.

85
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:02,996
He said the cops came.
They were looking for that Jason guy.

86
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,696
All right, you know what?

87
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:07,804
- Don't believe me.
Nobody does.

88
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:10,070
But I'm pretty sure,
the way the story goes...

89
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:12,544
...the place was called
Camp Crystal Lake.

90
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:15,616
Do you know how many lakes
are probably called Crystal Lake?

91
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:18,879
It's like Crystal Geyser, Crystal Water.
Go to a supermarket.

92
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:21,523
Every single bottle of water
is "Crystal" something.

93
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,851
- Aquafina.
- The...

94
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,322
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

95
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:28,590
The story could have happened anywhere.
It's how they get kids to shit themselves.

96
00:07:28,764 --> 00:07:31,358
- How's that beer, beer-snob?
- Better than my own piss.

97
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:35,197
You can drink that, by the way.
Yours, hers, mine. I swear, piss is sterile.

98
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,999
- You will never drink my piss.
- That's what you think.

99
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:39,835
What about me?

100
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:44,442
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Mm-hm.

101
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:47,913
I got marshmallow on my knee.

102
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:49,779
- Where you guys going?
- Go make out.

103
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:51,214
Oh, yeah?

104
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,786
- Hey, Mikey?
- Sweet.

105
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:54,013
Wear a condom.

106
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,587
An extra small one.

107
00:07:58,594 --> 00:08:01,154
I get it, dude.
You do what you gotta do to survive.

108
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,892
If we were all out here starving to death
and you were dead...

109
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,330
...I'd eat your leg.

110
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:09,767
- That's really sweet. Yeah.
- Thank you.

111
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:13,898
Why would you eat my leg, man?
I can teach you how to fish. Just go fishing.

112
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:16,004
I don't eat fish.

113
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:17,806
That's not what you told me.

114
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:28,656
Listen...

115
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:31,888
...I don't think I'm gonna stay
the whole time.

116
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,085
Did Wade's story scare you?

117
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:37,127
Please.

118
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,892
I just...

119
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,699
I don't feel right being here...

120
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:45,004
...so far away from my mom.

121
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,835
Your mom was the one that told me
to get you out of town for a few days.

122
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:51,703
- Really?
- Yeah.

123
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:56,143
And she's in good hands.
She's got her nurse right there.

124
00:08:58,721 --> 00:08:59,881
Come on.

125
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:04,652
Have sex with your boyfriend
in a cramped little tent.

126
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:09,695
We can get hammered,
blow some chunks in the woods.

127
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:12,265
Then we can go back Monday
and deal with whatever.

128
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,307
Hey.

129
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:25,411
I'm a fucking idiot.

130
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:26,946
Richie?

131
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:32,120
- The ephemeris data just didn't sync up.
- Oh, dude, that sucks.

132
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:34,222
Fucking right.

133
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:38,125
<i>- Do you know what this means?
- I wanna...</i>

134
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:39,591
What?

135
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:43,058
We're, like...
We're, like, a half mile away.

136
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:46,360
- Less.
- Shut up.

137
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:51,300
You know what makes me happy,
Richie? Global positioning systems.

138
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:53,231
GPS to the layperson.

139
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:55,668
NASA technology...

140
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:58,675
...in the palm of your hand.
Know what this little fucker does?

141
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,577
This guy sends a signal
up into outer space.

142
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:03,775
Signal.

143
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:05,682
Satellite gets it, turns it around.

144
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,915
It's like, "Oh, thank you, GPS.
I'm gonna send a signal to you. "

145
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,793
Back to the palm of your hand.
Technology, man.

146
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,394
It's fucking remarkable.

147
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,860
It is un-fucking-believable.

148
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,868
Wade, you gotta bounce, dude.
Tell your dumb shit to somebody else.

149
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:24,569
Why, because I'm fucking
teaching you something?

150
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,764
That's probably it.

151
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,040
Say, Richie, old buddy,
I'm gonna bounce.

152
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,514
You do that, brother. Okay.
- I'm spent.

153
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:39,280
May the Force be with your Schwartz.

154
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,288
You're in so much trouble.

155
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,758
Oh.

156
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,646
Fuck, yes.

157
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:57,191
I love you.

158
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,499
And you. And you.

159
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:02,804
I even love you.

160
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,430
Oh, my God. Look at this shit.

161
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:10,770
What the fuck? What the fuck?!

162
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:13,244
What's this? No, no! No! No!

163
00:12:17,286 --> 00:12:20,119
That must be the camp
that Wade was talking about.

164
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,121
- Let's check it out.
- No, I wanna go this way.

165
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:29,025
Come on.

166
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:31,195
Come on.

167
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:47,043
Wow, look at that.

168
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:55,151
Mike, where are you going?

169
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:56,723
Let's go inside.
- No.

170
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:59,122
- Where's your sense of adventure?
- Oh, come on.

171
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:01,092
Come on. What are you scared of?

172
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:02,924
No.

173
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:14,536
I am willing to bet
there's some pretty cool shit in here.

174
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:22,749
Mike, don't go in there.
What if some homeless person lives here?

175
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:24,647
No homeless person lives here.

176
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,021
You hungry?

177
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,395
Wow.

178
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:49,672
Look at how old this shit is.

179
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,376
It's like it was dragged here
from another century.

180
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:13,034
Check this out.

181
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:39,151
Hey. It looks like you.

182
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:45,089
- No, it doesn't.
- Yeah, it does.

183
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,958
It's cool, you should keep it.

184
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,518
It's a little kid's room.

185
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:21,634
Wasn't Jason the name
from Wade's story?

186
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,362
- I wanna go.
- What?

187
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,370
- Like, right now.
- Oh, come on.

188
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,565
Please?

189
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,935
You like that?
- Yeah. Wait for me. Wait for me.

190
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:32,239
- No, I think I'm gonna...
- Oh, no. Don't do that again.

191
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:34,879
We'll do it at the same time.
- Hang on.

192
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,450
- I'm almost there.
- Shit. I heard something.

193
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,919
Stop it. Wait, I'm serious.

194
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,823
- What?
- I think Wade's watching us.

195
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,993
What?

196
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:48,320
Well, fuck it, let the perv watch.

197
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,465
Right?

198
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:54,193
Shit.

199
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,533
Wade.

200
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,672
Dude, if you're out there whacking off,
man, that is not cool.

201
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:03,369
Come on, dude.

202
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:07,773
I think we're good.

203
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:18,451
Don't come yet.
No, no.

204
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:20,060
- Tell me when you want to.
Wait.

205
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,720
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.

206
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,464
Shit. Fuck. Shit.

207
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:31,971
Okay.

208
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,240
Wade!

209
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:42,012
I'm gonna kill you.

210
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:50,049
Okay?

211
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,590
- Okay?
- Okay.

212
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,853
No, go get him.
Tell him to leave us alone.

213
00:16:57,232 --> 00:17:00,360
I'm not gonna go out there with a boner.

214
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,127
Well, you're not getting any until you do.

215
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:07,665
- Go.
- Do not move, okay?

216
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:36,027
Richie?

217
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,115
Richie, stop fucking around.

218
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,155
Wade.

219
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:04,896
Dude, you jump out from a tree, I'm gonna
punch you in your face, I shit you not.

220
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,900
Come on, man.
I gotta get back to the fucking tent.

221
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:15,174
Holy shit.

222
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,949
You fucking jerk, you found the weed.

223
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:38,293
Wade. Wade!

224
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:52,475
Wade. Wade.

225
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:03,284
Amanda!

226
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,695
Amanda! Goddamn!

227
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:17,837
Richie!

228
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:20,808
Fuck!

229
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:29,347
Richie!

230
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,485
Oh, God!

231
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:50,399
Cool.

232
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:10,282
Whitney, you've gotta see this.

233
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,791
Mike. Come on.

234
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,897
No, I'm serious. You've gotta see this.
Somebody's been here.

235
00:20:27,442 --> 00:20:29,205
What is that?

236
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:30,902
There's something in there.

237
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,514
- Looks like some kind of a doll.
- Are you crazy?

238
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:43,947
Oh, my God! Ah!
- Ah!

239
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,363
There's something out there.

240
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:57,365
- Stay here.
- No.

241
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:19,820
Ah! Oh, my God!

242
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,023
Get away, get back!

243
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:24,990
Get off the floor!

244
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:29,233
- Get up!
- Mike!

245
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,395
Holy fuck!

246
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:33,540
- Ah!
Mike!

247
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:39,611
- Mike. Mike, Mike, Mike.
- Get out!

248
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:43,615
- Mike. Mike, get up. Come on.
- Go!

249
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:07,966
Help me!

250
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:12,143
- Mike! Mike!
- Run.

251
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:15,513
Run! Run, Whitney!

252
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,335
Oh, my God.

253
00:22:41,643 --> 00:22:42,837
Oh, God.

254
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,723
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

255
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:09,669
Whitney! Whitney, help.
Whitney, please. Help!

256
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:10,998
Whitney! Whitney.

257
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:13,438
Whitney!

258
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:21,242
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

259
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:24,680
Shit.

260
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:30,354
Come on. Shit.

261
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:38,489
Come on.

262
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:25,740
Oh, my God.
Babies have more space in the uterus.

263
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,678
Hey, Lawrence, how about a little help?

264
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:37,217
Dude, you're gonna ask the one black guy
to pump the gas for you? Shit.

265
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:39,987
Okay. Nolan.

266
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:41,925
How about I pay, you pump?

267
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:44,965
Sure, man.
Hey, I give a wicked blow job too.

268
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:48,666
Okay, well, um, we'll try that out later.

269
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:56,843
Whoa. Hey, bro, that's... I have
a heart murmur. What are you doing?

270
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:02,947
Thank you.
Where'd you get a knapsack like that?

271
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:06,315
It was a present, actually.
But I'm looking for my sister.

272
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:08,820
She's gone missing,
about a month and a half ago.

273
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:13,685
My parent's cabin is stocked.
You think you're actually gonna get laid?

274
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:16,160
Your parents do not have
Combos or Funyuns.

275
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:18,822
They definitely don't have Fritos.
And this is...

276
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,160
...not for sex.

277
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:23,498
- What are you gonna use them for?
- It's an experiment.

278
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:27,534
Okay. So just get behind me.
I'm not gonna pay for that shit.

279
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:30,974
Would you mind if I maybe just
put a flyer in the window or something?

280
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:33,808
Oh, I heard about that. That's sad.

281
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:37,781
If it was up to me, you could wallpaper
the whole place with them...

282
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,944
...but the owner makes the rules.

283
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,520
And he's a real:

284
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,149
Um...

285
00:25:46,328 --> 00:25:50,560
Well, is he here? Maybe I could talk to him.
Maybe if he understands the situation...

286
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:52,029
Are you gonna buy something?

287
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,966
I mean, you've been up here
for quite a while yapping, so...

288
00:25:57,606 --> 00:25:59,130
Sure. Yeah.

289
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,572
Thanks. So we have two waters
and some gas.

290
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,074
Two waters and some gas.

291
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:06,976
Guess I'm an asshole.

292
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:12,012
You okay, bro? Is everything good?

293
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,981
Yeah, everything's fine. Thanks.

294
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:15,917
But I'm not your bro.

295
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:19,084
So you don't wanna be friends?
You don't wanna hang out?

296
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:21,889
Let it go, Trent.
- It's not me. This guy's being a dick.

297
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,026
Yeah, it's me.
Obviously, I'm the one being a dick.

298
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,591
Sir, thank you very much anyways.

299
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:30,465
Yep.
- I'm sorry.

300
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:33,233
Thank you.

301
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,345
Seat belts.

302
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,289
Welcome back, Clay.

303
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:30,628
You mean that, Officer Bracke?

304
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,131
Son, I know you think
we're not on your side...

305
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:36,668
...that we're just a bunch of
dumb country hicks out here.

306
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:41,039
I put two 10-year veterans on that case.

307
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:45,305
We did three dozen interviews and ran
a county-wide search for your sister.

308
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:48,615
You know how many thousands of people
disappear every year...

309
00:27:48,783 --> 00:27:50,910
...even in this state alone?

310
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,553
But there's no evidence
that anything happened to Whitney...

311
00:27:54,723 --> 00:27:59,751
...or any of those other kids at Crystal Lake.
There's no car, no witnesses.

312
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:02,293
Nothing.

313
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:07,196
One of those kids
was her boyfriend, right?

314
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:09,193
Right.

315
00:28:09,637 --> 00:28:11,127
Well...

316
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:14,407
...they probably just took off together.

317
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,241
Our mother just died of cancer.
Did I tell you that?

318
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:21,143
- No, sir.
- Well, she did.

319
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:24,481
She was sick for a long time...

320
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:28,620
...and Whitney took care of her
every single day.

321
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,525
And then my sister didn't show up
for the funeral.

322
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:38,327
See, you just don't know my sister.
That's not possible.

323
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:39,959
Well...

324
00:28:40,402 --> 00:28:42,370
...she's not here, son.

325
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:47,637
Might wanna try looking someplace else.
That's what the other families are doing.

326
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:05,149
Can you say that with a...?
- Wow.

327
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,317
Can you say that with a little more hatred?

328
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,395
Nice.
- Shit.

329
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,069
Sir Lancelot, thank you.

330
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:18,228
Oh, man down.
- Take it easy, guys.

331
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:20,601
Is anyone getting a signal out here?

332
00:29:20,775 --> 00:29:23,869
Are you fucking with me?
I got business I gotta do this weekend.

333
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:25,307
What business?

334
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,414
Music. I'm trying to start a label.

335
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:29,777
Oh, yeah? Like what kind? Like rap?

336
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:33,215
Why you gotta go racial?

337
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:36,123
Look, don't put me in a box, all right?

338
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:39,055
What, because I'm black
I can't listen to Green Day?

339
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:41,956
You're right, that was dumb.
So, what kind of music?

340
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,119
Rap.

341
00:29:50,271 --> 00:29:51,898
Here it is.

342
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,000
Oh, my God.
- Yep.

343
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:57,269
All right, we have two bedrooms upstairs.
We've got one down.

344
00:29:57,445 --> 00:29:59,640
Someone can take the couch.
It's comfy as hell.

345
00:29:59,814 --> 00:30:02,112
Wow.
Nice, huh?

346
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:04,478
Damn.
That is a fierce pussy.

347
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:06,643
It's a bobcat. It's my dad's first kill.

348
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:09,881
I didn't think this long-ass car ride
was gonna be worth it...

349
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,821
...but it's kind of worth it.

350
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:13,483
This is bigger than the dorm.

351
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:16,528
What can I say?
Hey, take your feet off the table, please.

352
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,694
So make yourselves at home.

353
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:27,239
- What do you wanna do first?
What do you wanna do?

354
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,239
Oh, well...

355
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:34,078
I brought Sweet Lucille.
I think you all need to meet her.

356
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,120
Lucille? Baby, is that you?

357
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,155
- Lawrence, you've been cheating.
- No.

358
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:46,691
- I saw you with a bowl the other night.
- No, you...

359
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:48,260
A bowl.

360
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:09,176
Hello?

361
00:31:10,718 --> 00:31:12,345
Hello?

362
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,684
Hello?

363
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:23,090
Hello?

364
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:40,270
Christ.

365
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,983
- I just wanted to ask you a question.
- Hush.

366
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:58,827
I wanted to ask you
if maybe you've seen somebody.

367
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:01,193
My sister.

368
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,897
She came camping up around here
with some friends...

369
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:07,064
...and she's gone missing.

370
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,176
She ain't missing. She's dead.

371
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:15,313
- What?
- People go missing around here...

372
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:17,075
...they're gone for good.

373
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:20,015
Outsiders come,
they don't know where to walk.

374
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,621
They bring trouble.

375
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:23,416
We just wanna be left alone.

376
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:25,388
And so does he.

377
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,391
So does who?

378
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:33,464
Ma'am, please. So does who?

379
00:32:42,977 --> 00:32:46,413
You, baby. It's all you.
- Stop peer-pressuring me.

380
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,818
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit.

381
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,618
- Yes!
My fucking eye!

382
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:03,423
Guys, watch the floor, all right, please?
That's stained oak.

383
00:33:03,598 --> 00:33:07,432
- This is an outside game. Come on.
Wait, I got foam in my contact.

384
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:15,772
Hey. This is a great spot.

385
00:33:16,377 --> 00:33:18,902
Do you wanna go for a hike?
Get some exercise?

386
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,107
That'd be nice, but, well,
I can't exactly leave them here alone.

387
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:25,117
What are you talking about?

388
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:29,752
Have you seen what they're doing inside?

389
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,419
Crazy. Some drunken hoodlums.

390
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,720
- Hoodlums?
- Hoodlums.

391
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,090
What do you think they're gonna do?

392
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,393
- I mean, steal the deer head?
- You're right.

393
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:44,060
How are they gonna pull off the getaway?
We're leaving in the same car.

394
00:33:44,238 --> 00:33:45,967
Come on. Do you want some exercise?

395
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,234
Because I have this really great move
that I've been practicing...

396
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,742
...and I need someone to practice it with.

397
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:54,882
Very charming. Very charming.

398
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:56,710
Oh, come on.

399
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,912
- You wanna go on a hike?
- You like hikes now?

400
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:01,988
- I love hikes.
- I knew it.

401
00:34:02,156 --> 00:34:03,987
Will you get me a beer?

402
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:37,652
Excuse me.

403
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,821
Sir?

404
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:47,994
- Hey!
- Oh, shit. Jesus.

405
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:53,539
Sorry.

406
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:57,343
Jesus Christ.

407
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:59,440
You're fucking lucky there, stretch.

408
00:34:59,614 --> 00:35:03,550
Came that close to hitting the start button
on the whoop-ass machine, boy.

409
00:35:05,086 --> 00:35:08,578
Look, I didn't mean to startle you.
I was trying to get your attention.

410
00:35:08,756 --> 00:35:11,020
This is Mr. Garikes' property.

411
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:15,026
You're lucky that old mummy fart
didn't put buckshots in your ass.

412
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,029
Somebody's been stealing
his fucking kerosene too.

413
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:21,128
Look, I just came in here
to ask you something, okay?

414
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:23,702
I'm looking for this girl.
Have you seen her?

415
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,736
She's been missing for about a month.

416
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:28,738
I wish I had, man.

417
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,870
- I ain't seen her, though.
- Thanks.

418
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,613
- Take care.
- You too.

419
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,843
Shit. Hey, hey, hey.

420
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:39,919
I forgot, did you wanna buy some weed?

421
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:44,319
Seriously, I found a fucking shit ton of it
growing out there. A little bushel.

422
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:46,824
- Sell you some.
- No. Thanks.

423
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:49,462
- You sure? I got a whole bunch of it.
- I'm good.

424
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,722
You sure?

425
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,957
It's your fucking loss, dude.

426
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:55,694
It'll fuck your shit up, boy.

427
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,367
Good times...

428
00:35:57,538 --> 00:35:58,562
...fucker.

429
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,000
Just relax, okay?
These guys are your guests.

430
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,871
If you're...

431
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:08,538
If you're not comfortable having them here,
then why did you invite them?

432
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:11,547
So they could admire your place?

433
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:14,813
No. I just wanted to have
a good weekend. You know?

434
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:18,954
Hey, guys. Wanna check out
the other side of the lake with us?

435
00:36:21,028 --> 00:36:24,122
Um... You know what?
It's getting, you know...

436
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:28,257
No. That's okay. It's...
It's okay. It's getting kind of late.

437
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:29,560
- Yeah.
- Okay.

438
00:36:29,737 --> 00:36:30,829
Take my truck.

439
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,669
- Nice.
- I trust you.

440
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:36,742
Can you do me a favor?
Will you take the gas cans to the boat?

441
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:40,312
It's on the south end of the lake.
Just take a right onto Town Road.

442
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:42,005
- Take a right.
- Okay, and then?

443
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:44,447
Why don't you just type "boat"
into the nav?

444
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,018
- Technology, right?
- See you.

445
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:49,122
- Have fun.
- Later.

446
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:53,186
Don't drive my boat.

447
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:55,625
I'm the only one
that drives the boat, okay?

448
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,420
Aye, aye, captain.

449
00:36:57,598 --> 00:36:58,826
Damn straight.

450
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,932
What does that say about me
that the second Trent said...

451
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:09,008
..."Don't take my boat out,"
it was guaranteed that I would.

452
00:37:09,176 --> 00:37:10,905
It means you're a sociopath.

453
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:14,172
Now, what does it say about me
that I find that hot?

454
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:23,423
Hi, I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm looking for my sister and...

455
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:26,282
Hey.

456
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:31,229
- No luck?
- No. No, not yet.

457
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,527
- May I?
- Yeah.

458
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:36,363
- Thank you.
- Sure.

459
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:38,095
She's pretty.

460
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,232
Thanks.

461
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:44,677
Do you wanna come in for a second,
grab a drink?

462
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,369
Uh...

463
00:37:47,214 --> 00:37:50,206
I don't think your boyfriend
would like that too much.

464
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:51,908
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

465
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,279
And here we have the stoned
American male, foraging for food.

466
00:37:57,558 --> 00:37:59,048
Thanks.

467
00:38:04,398 --> 00:38:05,797
This should be interesting.

468
00:38:08,302 --> 00:38:10,793
Hey, Trent, you remember...

469
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:13,163
Clay.

470
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:17,277
Yeah. Of course I remember Clay.

471
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:18,873
Why is he in my house?

472
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,076
Hey, new guy. Beer?

473
00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:26,913
No, no. He's gotta get going.
You got flyers to pass out, right?

474
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:28,611
Yeah.

475
00:38:29,156 --> 00:38:30,350
Right.

476
00:38:30,524 --> 00:38:33,152
- Look, if you're hungry, we...
- Okay.

477
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:37,525
Look, Clay, obviously
she's just trying to be nice.

478
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:41,031
But you can't stay here.
No offense, but this is a private party.

479
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:43,432
- I don't know you.
- No, you don't know me.

480
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:45,663
That's so funny, I just said that.

481
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,070
Like two seconds ago,
that I don't know you.

482
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:51,734
I would probably leave soon
before I get pissed off and, you know...

483
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,005
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

484
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:55,475
What happens then?

485
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:59,141
Hey, look. Take it easy, Trent, all right?
I'll just... I'll walk you out.

486
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,986
Yeah.

487
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:03,915
Jenna. Jenna, come on.
Where you going?

488
00:39:11,966 --> 00:39:13,558
Sorry about that.

489
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:16,567
That's all right.
It's his house, you know?

490
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:17,965
Where's your car?

491
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:20,630
I do not have a car,
but I do have her.

492
00:39:20,808 --> 00:39:22,901
- Nice.
- Thanks.

493
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:26,774
- This thing runs?
- Yeah. Yeah, it runs.

494
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,040
So where you off to next?

495
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:33,243
I haven't been to the other side of the lake,
so I was gonna go check that out.

496
00:39:33,421 --> 00:39:36,390
- Do you want some company?
- I'd love some company.

497
00:40:04,118 --> 00:40:06,245
What's up, beaver bear?

498
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,687
It's a big motherfucker, huh?

499
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:28,867
Fuck, yeah.

500
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:32,803
You hot bitch.

501
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,444
Let Daddy have a little lick.

502
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:47,216
You like that, bitch? You know you do.

503
00:40:51,632 --> 00:40:53,725
What the fuck was that?

504
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:58,768
Don't smoke my weed, motherfucker.

505
00:41:01,842 --> 00:41:05,039
Somebody better not be
stealing the kerosene up there.

506
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:31,863
Shit.

507
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:09,506
Gina.

508
00:42:10,077 --> 00:42:12,307
It's just you, baby.

509
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:16,242
It's been a long time, Gina.

510
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:19,045
You remember that special night we had?

511
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,415
You remember
when you took my virginity?

512
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:22,613
You're sexy.

513
00:42:23,224 --> 00:42:27,285
You're still tight as ever.
I'm gonna fucking pound you so hard.

514
00:42:27,728 --> 00:42:29,559
What the fuck?

515
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:41,465
What the...?

516
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,304
That shit ain't fucking right, dude.
What the fuck?

517
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:35,426
You think we should take the boat out?
He's gonna find out.

518
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:37,188
- I knew it.
- What?

519
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:41,528
You're inhibited. You talk a big game,
but inside you're just a scared little girl.

520
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,569
Oh, really? Oh, okay, fine.

521
00:43:44,738 --> 00:43:47,707
You wanna find out who's really scared?
Let's do it.

522
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,571
All right. Let's go.

523
00:43:53,013 --> 00:43:55,811
So you and your sister
must be pretty close.

524
00:43:56,517 --> 00:43:59,486
We were pretty close when we
were younger. We kind of drifted.

525
00:43:59,653 --> 00:44:02,781
I mean, I bailed when I was 17,
and she stayed with my mom.

526
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:05,818
She kind of had to, I guess.

527
00:44:06,427 --> 00:44:09,453
I don't know,
she's always been the responsible one.

528
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:13,699
So when's the last time
you talked to her?

529
00:44:14,702 --> 00:44:18,900
About six months ago.
We got in a fight, actually.

530
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:23,066
She called and said she wanted to see me,
said she was counting on me...

531
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,767
...and I never showed.

532
00:44:24,945 --> 00:44:26,606
Excuse me.

533
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:31,143
What is that?

534
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:33,115
It's a GPS.

535
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:50,829
- All right, you ready?
- Ready. Let's do it.

536
00:44:56,877 --> 00:44:58,174
Yeah. Oh, shit.

537
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:05,649
Yeah.

538
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,755
Yeah.

539
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,326
Pick it, pick it.

540
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,525
Oh, you like the balls in your hand, huh?

541
00:45:21,702 --> 00:45:23,761
Which one? Which one is it?
Is that the one?

542
00:45:23,937 --> 00:45:26,235
- Those feel good, don't they?
- That's the one.

543
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:27,772
Shoot.

544
00:45:30,911 --> 00:45:32,378
Fuck.

545
00:45:32,546 --> 00:45:34,878
One of you has gotta shoot the boot.

546
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:36,508
That's you, babe.

547
00:45:36,683 --> 00:45:37,911
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

548
00:45:38,085 --> 00:45:40,679
You missed.
I've been carrying you the entire game.

549
00:45:40,854 --> 00:45:43,015
Come on, baby.
Drink up, drink up, drink up.

550
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:47,593
<i>Shoot the boot, shoot the boot,
shoot the boot.</i>

551
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:50,321
Shoot the boot.

552
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,557
Fuck that. I'm not drinking
out of your sweaty-ass sneaker.

553
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:55,429
You lost 10 in a row. Shoot.

554
00:45:55,602 --> 00:45:58,002
My house, my rules.
I'm not drinking that shit.

555
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,003
Fine.
- Oh, no.

556
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,938
- To all the felching...
- No. No.

557
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:04,543
...welching...
- Yes.

558
00:46:04,711 --> 00:46:06,941
...pussies of the world.

559
00:46:08,715 --> 00:46:10,979
That's disgusting.

560
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:27,725
Oh!

561
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:42,148
Yeah.

562
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,888
What are you doing, Nolan?!

563
00:47:01,335 --> 00:47:02,666
Nolan!

564
00:47:05,772 --> 00:47:09,333
Nolan. Oh, my God.

565
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:15,312
Nolan.

566
00:47:15,816 --> 00:47:17,545
Oh, God. Oh, God.

567
00:47:17,718 --> 00:47:19,345
Nolan?

568
00:47:21,622 --> 00:47:24,147
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

569
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:34,928
What do you want from me?

570
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,660
Oh, my God.

571
00:48:12,217 --> 00:48:14,344
I never liked camp.
Why?

572
00:48:15,554 --> 00:48:19,684
Bad food, bugs, cheap toilet paper.

573
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:30,365
Know what? Wait. Maybe we should
check these cabins out, you know?

574
00:48:30,535 --> 00:48:32,435
- Sure.
- Come on.

575
00:49:49,047 --> 00:49:52,483
Let's just check out this last cabin,
then we'll head back.

576
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:07,321
Come on.

577
00:50:56,514 --> 00:50:58,209
You really should call the police.

578
00:50:58,383 --> 00:51:01,250
I've already called.
They're not looking for her anymore.

579
00:51:01,419 --> 00:51:03,216
No one is, except for me.

580
00:51:03,655 --> 00:51:05,282
Then they should look harder because...

581
00:51:05,457 --> 00:51:06,981
Oh! Ow.

582
00:51:07,158 --> 00:51:09,626
- You all right?
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

583
00:51:09,828 --> 00:51:11,455
You sure?
- Yeah.

584
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:17,463
Let's get out of here.

585
00:51:19,905 --> 00:51:21,600
Watch your step.

586
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:35,351
Give me a sec,
I gotta change out my batteries.

587
00:51:39,491 --> 00:51:42,483
- Someone's coming.
- Oh, shit. Let's go.

588
00:51:53,805 --> 00:51:55,136
Oh, my God.

589
00:53:21,993 --> 00:53:23,722
Where's he going?

590
00:53:30,568 --> 00:53:33,503
- Oh, my God. We gotta go.
- Shh.

591
00:53:33,671 --> 00:53:35,662
- I gotta follow him.
He had a dead body.

592
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,673
- We gotta go. We gotta warn my friends.
- Okay, okay.

593
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:15,441
You okay?
Yeah.

594
00:54:15,613 --> 00:54:17,171
What is that?

595
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:22,344
Help!

596
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,314
Come on, let's go.

597
00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:27,890
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

598
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:29,822
Help me!

599
00:54:43,942 --> 00:54:46,069
Help me!

600
00:54:46,244 --> 00:54:48,235
Help!

601
00:54:52,283 --> 00:54:53,944
Help me!

602
00:56:28,913 --> 00:56:30,642
No. No.

603
00:57:12,423 --> 00:57:13,754
Please don't hurt me.

604
00:57:20,965 --> 00:57:22,830
It's okay.

605
00:57:26,104 --> 00:57:27,662
Jason.

606
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,739
It's okay.

607
00:58:11,015 --> 00:58:12,778
Clay.

608
00:58:24,896 --> 00:58:26,625
Shit.

609
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,149
Come on.

610
00:59:07,004 --> 00:59:08,130
Shit.

611
00:59:17,982 --> 00:59:20,450
- This way. Come on.
- Okay.

612
01:01:22,607 --> 01:01:24,598
In my next life...

613
01:01:25,243 --> 01:01:27,404
...I wanna come back...

614
01:01:27,578 --> 01:01:31,070
...as one of the buttons
on the ass pocket of her jean shorts.

615
01:01:32,617 --> 01:01:36,485
- Just go over there and fucking talk to her.
- Are you kidding me?

616
01:01:36,654 --> 01:01:39,817
I have a better shot at
fucking a penguin than that girl.

617
01:01:47,231 --> 01:01:49,597
- Let's light this bad boy.
- Great.

618
01:01:53,037 --> 01:01:54,732
Here we go.

619
01:01:56,274 --> 01:01:57,434
Yes.

620
01:01:57,608 --> 01:01:59,166
Hey.

621
01:01:59,343 --> 01:02:02,904
Here's to Daddy's shoes
and fucking douche bags.

622
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,743
- Let's just all be one big happy cliché.
- Yes.

623
01:02:06,918 --> 01:02:10,786
Dude, what the fuck?
Please, try not to burn down my house.

624
01:02:13,824 --> 01:02:15,985
Did you forget how to drink that?

625
01:02:19,063 --> 01:02:20,724
Just bring it to your lips...

626
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:23,827
...blow...

627
01:02:25,336 --> 01:02:27,031
...and suck.

628
01:02:28,205 --> 01:02:30,935
- You're really good at that.
- Mm-hm.

629
01:02:36,881 --> 01:02:39,543
Fuck, dude!
You just broke my dad's fucking chair.

630
01:02:39,717 --> 01:02:40,809
My fucking lip, man.

631
01:02:40,985 --> 01:02:44,318
I don't care about your fucking lip.
This is a family heirloom.

632
01:02:44,488 --> 01:02:47,423
Oh, shit. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
- Fuck!

633
01:02:47,592 --> 01:02:50,493
I just... No, I can fix this.
I just need some tools.

634
01:02:50,661 --> 01:02:53,562
- He can fix it.
- You better pull some MacGyver shit.

635
01:02:53,731 --> 01:02:56,029
All right, go to the toolshed.
It's down the path.

636
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:59,167
Yeah, okay. I'm just...
Trent, I'm sorry, man.

637
01:02:59,337 --> 01:03:00,770
You won't be disappointed.

638
01:03:00,938 --> 01:03:03,429
They don't call me "wood wizard"
because I masturbate.

639
01:03:03,608 --> 01:03:05,906
Grab a flashlight, you fucking idiot.

640
01:03:06,677 --> 01:03:07,769
Thanks.

641
01:03:10,414 --> 01:03:12,541
Forget about it. He'll fix it.

642
01:03:12,717 --> 01:03:14,617
Let's go finish this.

643
01:03:21,158 --> 01:03:23,820
That's a ugly fucking chair anyway.

644
01:03:24,295 --> 01:03:26,820
My name is Trent.
My daddy bent me over this chair...

645
01:03:26,998 --> 01:03:29,831
...and beat me when I was little,
so you need to fix it.

646
01:03:38,709 --> 01:03:40,040
Hey, now.

647
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,839
Yes.

648
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:53,950
You people are rich.

649
01:03:54,723 --> 01:03:56,691
Holy crap.

650
01:03:56,925 --> 01:04:00,861
Poor people call this a house.
Jesus Christ.

651
01:04:07,836 --> 01:04:10,304
You have never used this shit.

652
01:04:10,572 --> 01:04:13,769
Fucking douche bag.
Skis. What the fuck?

653
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:20,979
Ha! Ha!

654
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:25,047
"Lagavulin, product of Scotland. "

655
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:27,485
Oh.

656
01:04:27,656 --> 01:04:30,022
That just smells like money.

657
01:04:34,429 --> 01:04:36,989
I knew there was a reason
to be your friend, Trent.

658
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:41,397
More? Oh, absolutely. No...
All right, you don't have to force it on me.

659
01:04:43,405 --> 01:04:44,429
Fuck.

660
01:04:44,606 --> 01:04:46,540
You can grease wheels with this shit.

661
01:04:46,975 --> 01:04:48,943
That's payment for being a douche bag.

662
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:53,909
Okay.

663
01:05:00,155 --> 01:05:01,554
Okay.

664
01:05:01,924 --> 01:05:03,551
Okay.

665
01:05:04,459 --> 01:05:05,790
Oh, yeah.

666
01:05:06,061 --> 01:05:08,894
Oh, wow. Your tits are stupendous.

667
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:12,026
Wow, you really know
how to make a girl feel special, huh?

668
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,168
That's what I do.

669
01:05:19,308 --> 01:05:22,004
Yeah, they can go. Take off my pants.

670
01:05:22,177 --> 01:05:23,701
They can go.

671
01:05:37,259 --> 01:05:39,159
Oh, man.

672
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:42,428
All right. Let's see what you've got.

673
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:48,028
All right, give me something, baby.
What you got for me? Give me something.

674
01:05:48,203 --> 01:05:50,899
Goddamn. Not even a swimsuit? Shit.

675
01:05:51,073 --> 01:05:53,633
Goddamn winter catalog.

676
01:05:53,809 --> 01:05:55,037
Oh, okay.

677
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:00,040
Gonna have to do.

678
01:06:04,186 --> 01:06:07,280
Lady, I'm about to ruin your perfect day.

679
01:06:16,698 --> 01:06:18,131
All right.

680
01:06:19,101 --> 01:06:21,501
Shit. You scared the piss out of me.

681
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:25,106
Where is everybody? There's a guy out there
carrying a dead body.

682
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:26,604
Jenna, where's the phone?

683
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:28,436
I don't know. Over there?

684
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:32,569
You fucking with me because I'm high?
That's not cool. I just finished smoking.

685
01:06:32,748 --> 01:06:34,511
Where's the phone?

686
01:06:37,419 --> 01:06:39,353
Hi, I want to report a homicide.

687
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:40,749
Clay Miller.

688
01:06:40,922 --> 01:06:43,447
Yeah, I'm at a house by Crystal Lake.
It's...

689
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,183
Yeah, that's it. Hurry.

690
01:06:46,528 --> 01:06:48,291
They said they're sending someone.

691
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:49,987
- Police?
Yeah.

692
01:06:50,165 --> 01:06:53,362
- Where is everybody else?
- I don't know. I've been here all day.

693
01:06:53,535 --> 01:06:56,003
Chelsea and Nolan left, like,
hours ago to the lake.

694
01:06:56,171 --> 01:06:58,639
- Well, what about Trent? Bree?
- They're in the bedroom.

695
01:07:03,845 --> 01:07:06,370
- Your tits are fucking just...
- I know.

696
01:07:06,548 --> 01:07:07,845
...so juicy, dude.

697
01:07:10,519 --> 01:07:12,419
You got perfect nipple placement, baby.

698
01:07:15,857 --> 01:07:17,654
This better not go on
the fucking Internet.

699
01:07:19,161 --> 01:07:23,689
You should win in a fucking titty contest.

700
01:07:30,772 --> 01:07:33,002
Trent, Bree. You guys in there?

701
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:38,843
Trent! Bree!

702
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:40,504
Shut the fuck up!

703
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:43,008
Get out here!

704
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:45,244
They're just fucking with us.

705
01:07:47,656 --> 01:07:49,886
- Ignore her.
Come on, guys.

706
01:07:50,325 --> 01:07:52,885
Get out here. There's a guy out there.

707
01:07:53,061 --> 01:07:55,723
We're busy in here, baby.
- Trent.

708
01:08:30,765 --> 01:08:31,823
Yeah.

709
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:35,331
Okay. All right, Trent.
Let me educate you.

710
01:08:35,504 --> 01:08:39,873
You ever seen a crossover before, huh?
I'm gonna show you right now.

711
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:42,669
I'll bet you never...
Whoa. Ow.

712
01:08:42,844 --> 01:08:44,744
Jesus.

713
01:08:51,153 --> 01:08:52,643
Hey.

714
01:08:53,455 --> 01:08:55,355
Now, this is a man's sport.

715
01:08:57,159 --> 01:08:59,957
You're even curved to the left,
like my penis.

716
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:04,191
Okay, it's overtime. Line change.

717
01:09:04,633 --> 01:09:05,793
Chewie's on the ice.

718
01:09:05,967 --> 01:09:09,960
Send the puck around the back of the net.
Here we go. Pass back to the middle. Oh!

719
01:09:14,376 --> 01:09:15,434
Oh, my...

720
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,703
No, no, no.

721
01:09:20,815 --> 01:09:22,544
Shit.

722
01:09:25,854 --> 01:09:27,185
Shit.

723
01:09:36,598 --> 01:09:39,897
Oh, God.
You scared the shit out of me, bro.

724
01:09:41,836 --> 01:09:44,031
Are you looking for this?

725
01:09:44,206 --> 01:09:48,165
Because it completes your outfit.

726
01:09:51,913 --> 01:09:53,107
Oh, fuck.

727
01:09:57,052 --> 01:09:58,883
What the fuck? Oh, Jesus.

728
01:10:10,932 --> 01:10:12,229
No.

729
01:11:08,523 --> 01:11:10,684
Oh, my God, baby. Getting close.

730
01:11:10,992 --> 01:11:12,152
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

731
01:11:12,327 --> 01:11:13,851
I got eight seconds,
then I'm going.

732
01:11:15,964 --> 01:11:17,932
Oh, God.

733
01:11:30,011 --> 01:11:31,137
Oh, God.

734
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:37,379
I'm going soon. I'm going.

735
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:42,954
No.

736
01:12:00,041 --> 01:12:02,703
That was...

737
01:12:02,877 --> 01:12:04,742
Stupendous?

738
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:09,974
To say the least, yeah.

739
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:19,285
Who's messing with the lights?
- Oh, shit. Chewie's still out there.

740
01:12:20,428 --> 01:12:23,295
- Phone's dead. Do you have a cell?
Nothing has a signal.

741
01:12:23,465 --> 01:12:24,727
What are you doing here?

742
01:12:24,899 --> 01:12:26,457
Trent...
- Get the fuck out, buddy.

743
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,659
- Easy.
- He's just trying to help us.

744
01:12:29,104 --> 01:12:33,336
You leave with this guy for eight hours,
fucking all over the woods?

745
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:36,609
You know what? Why don't both of you
just get the fuck out?

746
01:12:36,778 --> 01:12:38,746
- There's a bigger problem...
- Shut up.

747
01:12:38,913 --> 01:12:41,279
Are you serious?
There is a killer out there.

748
01:12:41,449 --> 01:12:42,973
He's the one who cut the lights.

749
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:46,678
Trent, don't you get it?
Chelsea and Nolan never came back.

750
01:12:46,855 --> 01:12:48,288
Lawrence, what are you doing?

751
01:12:48,456 --> 01:12:51,152
My boy's still out there.
I'm gonna go get him.

752
01:12:51,559 --> 01:12:53,322
No, man. Don't go out there. Please.

753
01:12:53,495 --> 01:12:56,328
Look, I told, all right?
You can't get a handle on me.

754
01:12:56,765 --> 01:12:58,756
I'll surprise you every time.

755
01:13:26,895 --> 01:13:28,385
Chewie?

756
01:13:35,303 --> 01:13:37,032
Hey, Chewie?

757
01:13:44,979 --> 01:13:46,810
Chew, you in there?

758
01:14:15,109 --> 01:14:16,440
Chewie?

759
01:14:18,446 --> 01:14:20,437
Chewie, you in here?

760
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:23,502
Oh, fuck.

761
01:15:32,654 --> 01:15:33,985
Get the fuck off me.

762
01:15:40,528 --> 01:15:42,826
Take that, motherfucker.

763
01:16:07,989 --> 01:16:11,220
Guys, this is bullshit.
The power goes out here all the time.

764
01:16:13,828 --> 01:16:15,489
Help me!

765
01:16:16,965 --> 01:16:20,059
Help! Help me!

766
01:16:20,234 --> 01:16:22,259
Please, help me.

767
01:16:22,503 --> 01:16:24,698
- Lawrence.
- No, no, no. You can't go out there.

768
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:26,806
- We have to help him.
No, we can't.

769
01:16:26,975 --> 01:16:29,739
He's using your friend as bait.
He wants us to go out.

770
01:16:29,911 --> 01:16:31,503
Well, you don't know that.

771
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,340
Jesus, where are the police?

772
01:16:33,514 --> 01:16:35,038
I can't move.

773
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:37,344
- Help me!
We have to help him.

774
01:16:37,785 --> 01:16:39,013
I can't die like this.

775
01:16:40,355 --> 01:16:42,414
Help me, please. Trent.

776
01:16:43,024 --> 01:16:44,855
Somebody, help.

777
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:46,688
Oh, my God, please.

778
01:16:47,962 --> 01:16:49,054
I can't fucking...

779
01:16:49,797 --> 01:16:51,389
Somebody's gotta do something!

780
01:16:54,002 --> 01:16:55,492
Please.

781
01:17:01,542 --> 01:17:03,908
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

782
01:17:21,295 --> 01:17:24,890
Everyone's gonna be okay, all right?
The cops are on their way.

783
01:17:28,503 --> 01:17:29,834
What are you doing?

784
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:46,780
Trent.

785
01:19:18,713 --> 01:19:20,203
Jenna?

786
01:20:27,982 --> 01:20:29,506
Police.

787
01:20:29,684 --> 01:20:32,414
- Oh, thank God.
Go, go.

788
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:35,884
Police, open up.

789
01:20:39,527 --> 01:20:43,293
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Go, go, go.
Oh, my God.

790
01:20:50,605 --> 01:20:51,970
Get the door.

791
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:53,766
Okay. Shit.

792
01:20:53,941 --> 01:20:57,001
- What are you doing? Is he inside?
- He killed the cop.

793
01:20:57,979 --> 01:21:00,948
What the fuck, you got a gun?
Let's go now.

794
01:21:03,584 --> 01:21:05,609
Jesus! What are you doing?

795
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:08,254
Give me the gun.

796
01:21:08,623 --> 01:21:10,147
Someone's in there.

797
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,320
Check it out.

798
01:21:30,745 --> 01:21:32,440
Bree's dead. He killed Bree.

799
01:21:40,454 --> 01:21:41,853
Come on.

800
01:21:44,158 --> 01:21:45,489
Come on.

801
01:21:46,227 --> 01:21:48,889
There's no gun, no keys, nothing.
Let's go.

802
01:21:55,403 --> 01:21:57,098
Where are the keys?

803
01:22:01,108 --> 01:22:04,509
- Help! We got officers down.
- My keys are gone. Where are my keys?

804
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:07,204
Hey, Jenna, fuck this guy.
Let's get out of here.

805
01:22:13,421 --> 01:22:15,753
Go. Go. Go, go, go! Jesus.

806
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,861
Oh, my God.

807
01:22:56,530 --> 01:22:59,522
Shit. Where the fuck are you, gun?

808
01:23:00,368 --> 01:23:01,699
Fuck.

809
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:09,841
Fuck it.

810
01:24:57,418 --> 01:25:00,216
- Oh, my God, that's Chelsea.
- We gotta keep moving. Go.

811
01:25:11,765 --> 01:25:13,733
All right, this way.

812
01:25:17,371 --> 01:25:19,305
Come on.
Okay.

813
01:26:38,852 --> 01:26:40,513
Help!

814
01:26:40,988 --> 01:26:42,319
Shh.

815
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:44,116
- What was that?
Let me out!

816
01:26:44,291 --> 01:26:46,919
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

817
01:26:49,163 --> 01:26:51,290
Help me!

818
01:26:51,465 --> 01:26:52,989
Help me.

819
01:28:01,402 --> 01:28:03,063
This way.

820
01:28:22,556 --> 01:28:24,922
Clay?
- Whitney. Whitney.

821
01:28:25,092 --> 01:28:27,322
Oh, God, Clay.
Thank God.

822
01:28:27,494 --> 01:28:29,689
Are you okay? You okay? Thank God.

823
01:28:29,863 --> 01:28:31,888
- Are you okay?
Yeah.

824
01:28:32,766 --> 01:28:35,064
You're okay. You're okay.
Okay. You're okay?

825
01:28:35,536 --> 01:28:36,867
Oh, God.

826
01:28:37,738 --> 01:28:39,433
- Okay.
Just get me out of here.

827
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:41,039
Fuck.

828
01:28:41,208 --> 01:28:43,699
- Come on, you guys, let's go.
- Can you break it?

829
01:28:43,877 --> 01:28:45,868
- No, just break it, just break it.
- Okay.

830
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:49,447
Yeah, just go. Go. Just fucking do it.

831
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:52,107
- Hold still. Hold your hands.
- Hurry up, hurry.

832
01:28:52,286 --> 01:28:53,878
Do it. Fucking do it.

833
01:28:56,890 --> 01:28:59,552
- We gotta get out of here.
- I don't wanna hit you.

834
01:28:59,727 --> 01:29:01,820
- Just fucking do it.
- Okay, okay.

835
01:29:01,995 --> 01:29:03,019
Hurry.

836
01:29:05,766 --> 01:29:07,256
Oh, God.

837
01:29:12,506 --> 01:29:14,133
Holy shit.

838
01:29:14,308 --> 01:29:15,935
Okay, okay, okay.

839
01:29:16,577 --> 01:29:18,670
You guys, I can see him. He's coming.

840
01:29:18,846 --> 01:29:20,245
- What?
We gotta go.

841
01:29:20,414 --> 01:29:23,008
- Grab onto me. Grab onto me.
Let's go. Come on, hurry.

842
01:29:23,183 --> 01:29:24,411
Go, go, go.

843
01:29:25,552 --> 01:29:27,918
Go. Come on.

844
01:29:47,408 --> 01:29:49,774
Go. Go.

845
01:29:57,818 --> 01:29:59,149
It's a dead end.

846
01:29:59,353 --> 01:30:00,752
What are we gonna do?

847
01:30:00,921 --> 01:30:02,650
Clay?

848
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:04,921
Hurry.

849
01:30:05,659 --> 01:30:06,887
Here. Here.

850
01:30:11,799 --> 01:30:13,391
Come on, we can get through here.

851
01:30:15,169 --> 01:30:16,659
Follow me.

852
01:30:17,871 --> 01:30:19,463
Go, go, go.
It's safe, guys.

853
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:22,165
Give me your hand, Jenna.
Come on, hurry.

854
01:30:22,342 --> 01:30:24,674
Give me your hand. Okay. I got you.

855
01:30:27,648 --> 01:30:30,811
Oh, my... Fuck. Jesus, God, no.

856
01:30:32,419 --> 01:30:34,148
- Oh, God. Clay. Clay.
- No. No.

857
01:30:35,689 --> 01:30:38,624
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, God. Oh, God. Clay.

858
01:30:39,493 --> 01:30:40,892
Come on, we gotta go.

859
01:30:50,838 --> 01:30:53,773
Look. I think this might be a way out.

860
01:31:05,352 --> 01:31:07,650
All right. Let's go. Come on. Hurry.

861
01:31:09,823 --> 01:31:11,814
Let's go. Watch out.

862
01:31:14,595 --> 01:31:15,721
Come on.

863
01:31:15,896 --> 01:31:17,329
Hurry.
- Damn it. It's stuck.

864
01:31:17,498 --> 01:31:18,522
Come on, come on.

865
01:31:18,699 --> 01:31:20,792
Come on.
- Hurry.

866
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:33,906
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.
Give me your hand. Okay.

867
01:31:34,081 --> 01:31:36,606
On three. One... Come on.

868
01:31:38,185 --> 01:31:41,951
- Run. Whitney, get...
- Clay! Clay! Clay!

869
01:31:42,422 --> 01:31:43,719
Stop it!

870
01:31:44,992 --> 01:31:46,220
No!

871
01:31:46,393 --> 01:31:48,384
Clay! Clay!

872
01:31:50,664 --> 01:31:53,064
Shit. Shit.

873
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:38,438
Fuck you.

874
01:32:44,484 --> 01:32:46,679
No, no, no!

875
01:32:55,963 --> 01:32:57,760
Whitney!

876
01:32:57,931 --> 01:33:00,991
- Whitney.
Clay. Clay!

877
01:33:01,168 --> 01:33:02,726
Come on.

878
01:33:06,173 --> 01:33:07,663
Hurry.

879
01:33:08,642 --> 01:33:10,132
Come on.

880
01:33:26,526 --> 01:33:27,857
Hide.

881
01:34:34,261 --> 01:34:35,922
Shit, fuck.

882
01:35:27,514 --> 01:35:29,004
Jason.

883
01:35:41,795 --> 01:35:43,660
It's okay.

884
01:35:45,732 --> 01:35:47,063
You can stop now.

885
01:35:48,602 --> 01:35:49,864
It's okay.

886
01:37:03,143 --> 01:37:04,474
Jason.

887
01:37:05,912 --> 01:37:07,402
Say hi to Mommy...

888
01:37:09,316 --> 01:37:11,250
...in hell.
