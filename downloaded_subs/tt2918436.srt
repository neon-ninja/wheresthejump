right then, your brain just floods your

as opposed to, you know,
St. Peter and the pearly white gates?

255
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,523

- Because one is empirical and one is,

you know, it's a cute story, but it's...

257
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,640
No, it's not. I mean, whatever you
wanna call it, the soul, consciousness,

258
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,288
it's just neural impulses firing in
your brain, right? That makes it energy.

259
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,005
Energy can't be created or destroyed,

260
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,606
it can just be transformed
from one thing to another.

that's science.

EVA: So what's your theory?

263
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,407
I think, maybe when we die, the DMT
is there to help our souls move on,

264
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,483
to get them wherever
they're supposed to be.

265
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,601

"Here. Here's life, here's death.

334
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,850
Yeah, I'm kind of in the middle
of something. I'll be there in a minute.

335
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,605
OK.

336
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,326
What the hell is going on here?

337
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,886
Dr. Walton,
can you hold on for a second?

338
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,610
- Uh, yeah.
- I'll meet you downstairs.

339
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,046
Sure.

340
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,725
The dean needs to talk to you.

341
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,282
WOMAN: Honestly, did you for one second
consider the implications of this?

342
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,642
Eighty-three percent of our student body
identify as religious.

343
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,691
You throw in the alumni donors,
that number's more like 90 percent.

344
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,605
Don't play the religious card.
This has nothing to do with religion.

345
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,923
You were the one who decided
to do an unsanctioned experiment,

346
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,889
in direct violation of the Review Board

347
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,963
and the grant agreement
which you signed.

348
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,561
Which says, you were
going to "study new methods

349
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,200
of arresting neural decay
in coma patients."

350
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,567
Yes, exactly! That is how it started.

351
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,371
But how do you think that penicillin
was discovered? Or Teflon?

352
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,569
Or even Coca-Cola, for that matter?
Accidents that happen in the lab.

353
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,001
Accidents that lead
to new lines of inquiry.

354
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,563
You are a doctor, you understand
how science works. It's by adapting.

355
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,930
You're not adapting. You are playing God
with a bunch of dead animals.

356
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,844
You had to know this was coming.

357
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,362
How do you know all this?

358
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,042
No way you could've known
about those animal trials.

We have the right to review any material
that's posted to our server,

360
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,767

- Bullshit.

361
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,725
Somebody fed this to you, specifically
to get this project shut down.

362
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,285
Was it one of your big pharma friends?

363
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,331
Did somebody donate a medical wing
or a new student union?

364
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,527
Who was it?

365
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,651
Pull the hard drives,
any security key cards.

- Yes.

It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've been a fan of your work.

Effective immediately,

- Stop. What?
- Hey, that's personal property, man!

374
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,880
I don't understand.
We're operating under a grant

375
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,361
- from Werner-Goss Biotechnical.
- And as of two hours ago,

376
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,603
Crylonis Industries became the
principal shareholder in Werner-Goss.

377
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,764
- No, you can't do this.

I'm sure it must be difficult for you,

383
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,760
but there's an important lesson
to be learned here:

384
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,441
There's always a consequence
for breaking the rules.

385

- They took everything.

it's quite the coincidence.

388
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,444
You show up out of nowhere,
videotape everything, and then poof,

389
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,722
they take it all,
including our backup data.

390
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,850
Hang on. We made her keep all the
footage in the lab. It's not her fault.

391
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,729
We lost everything.

392
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,043
Four years of our lives,
our reputations, everything.

393
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,726
If it's not her, then please tell me,
what the hell happened?

394
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,201
If they wanted the serum,
why didn't they just hire us?

395
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,926
I mean, let's imagine for a second
that you're Crylonis, OK?

396
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,844
And you find out
about the Lazarus serum.

397
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,889
You realize this thing is a gold mine,

398
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,686
and you also realize
that Werner-Goss sponsored it.

399
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,207
So you buy Werner-Goss,
that's the first thing right there.

400
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,523
Then you realize all is takes is
one anonymous call to the Review Board,

401
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,331
and all of a sudden
you own everything in that lab.

402
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,527
You have the legal rights.

403
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,921
Suddenly, you're not
splitting the profits anymore.

00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,923

We're gonna duplicate the experiment.
It's the only way.

00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,366
- You're joking, right?
- What, we're gonna walk away now?

410
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,921
We have no proof. No one's ever
gonna believe that it was us.

411
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,208
We're never gonna have
another chance at this, OK?

412
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,647
Look, they're not gonna start
cleaning the lab till tomorrow, right?

413
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,609
That gives us at least,
what, like 12 hours?

414
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,047
We break in there,
we duplicate the experiment.

415
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,282
You film it,
and we take back what's ours.

416
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,125
Duplicate it how?
I mean, they took all the serum.

417
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,330
We figured, just in case.

418
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,600

This is absolutely doable.

421

They took our key cards.

I was in the building. I was there.

669
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,884
I could hear the people,
they were stuck!

670
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,565
Zoe, that was a dream.

671
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,040
It's a traumatic memory
from your childhood. It's not real.

672
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,488
That's what I thought.
I couldn't wake up.

673
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,325
I was stuck.
It was endless. I tried.

674
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,404
It went on and on.
And every day, I was there.

675
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,528
It was the same, over and over.
Every single day.

676
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,523
Zoe, you were gone
for less than an hour.

677
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,803
- You were right here. You didn't...
- Oh, no, no. You don't understand.

- and it helps your soul move on or...
- DMT.
