1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:51,010


3
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:11,049


4
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,040
No!

5
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:42,023
My purge playlist. I'm having a lot of fun to it.

6
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:44,039
Especially this final tune.

7
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:47,033
As it is, it will be the last song you ever hear.

8
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:49,023
Tough choice.

9
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:52,040
Then I thought of George Clinton,

10
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:56,034
the King of Interplanetary Funklinship.

11
00:01:56,038 --> 00:02:00,031
George is psychedelic rock if you're
feeling a little funky obviously.

12
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:05,051
And soulful, which is the least that I can do.

13
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:10,032
Now, I played a lot of purge games tonight.

14
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:14,035
We've just one more. It's simple and effective.

15
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,033
It's called "Mummy's Choice".

16
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:24,050
Mummy, which one of you will survive this year's purge?

17
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:27,037


18
00:02:41,046 --> 00:02:47,026


19
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,039


20
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:54,853
<i>This is just one of a dozen protests around our capital

21
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:58,036
<i>after reports emerged caliming
that the new founding fathers

22
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:02,034
<i>have been using the Purge to
help their own economic agenda

23
00:03:02,038 --> 00:03:06,040
<i>in a recent statement by the incendiary purge detractor,
Bishop Dante.

24
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:12,039
<i>For the past 20 years, the NFFA has taken to legalize
murder to decrease the poor population

25
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:15,039
<i>which, in turn, keeps the government spending down.

26
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,029
<i>Less welfare, less healthcare and less housing.

27
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:22,039
<i>Recent polling suggested that
growing of anti-purge sentiments

28
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:26,037
<i>may have a monumental effect on
the upcoming presidential election.

29
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,050
<i>Establishment NFFA candidate, Minister Edwidge Owens

30
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:35,037
<i>has been losing ground to wildcard
independent candidate, Senator Charley Roan.

31
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:42,041
<i>Eighteen years ago, Roan was forced to watch the
brutal execution of her entire family on purge night.

32
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:45,025
<i>And entered the political arena soon after

33
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:49,025
<i>with one goal in mind;
to put an end to the annual holiday.

34
00:03:49,026 --> 00:03:55,022
I have no doubt that the soul of our country is at stake.

35
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,049
<i>The Purge has to come to an end.

36
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:02,037
<i>Senator Roan is proving to be the
greatest threat to the NFFA regime

37
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,040
<i>since they first took office 25 years ago.

38
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:23,326
Is the cunt that close?

39
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:27,202
All the polls have her a point behind.

40
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:29,026
I'm sorry, Caleb. I ..

41
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:31,026
No need to be sorry, Minister.

42
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,723
You are doing a great job.

43
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:35,200
Let us put you where you need to be.

44
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:37,537
Thomas.

45
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:43,335
We have our people out there
countering all these entire NFFA bullshit.

46
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:45,031
What else can we do?

47
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:49,537
We do whatever it fucking takes!

48
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:58,249
I've had it with all these idealistic pigs.

49
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:01,206
They want the impossible.

50
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:04,223
Everyone to have.

51
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,436
Some cannot have. Not enough to go around.

52
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:23,035
It's time to do something about all these
cocksuckers like that rat, Bishop,

53
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:24,775
and the cunt Senator.

54
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,358
Trying to dismantle everything we built.

55
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:37,633
We are going to use this year's purge to
do some spring-cleaning, gentlemen.

56
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:51,051
<i>And where will you be spending tonight, Minister?

57
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:56,027
I will once again be presiding over
my party's midnight purge Mass

58
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:57,038
because I still believe in them.

59
00:05:57,042 --> 00:06:00,032
The midnight purge Mass

60
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:04,045
where our great NFFA leaders gather
together and slaughter innocents.

61
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:07,033
Is murder our new religion?
Senator.

62
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:09,049
Murder's our new religion? Snappy.

63
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:14,026
Now, the midnight purge Mass is where
NFFA leaders gather to celebrate

64
00:06:14,027 --> 00:06:17,024
the night which saved this country from economic ruin.

65
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:18,033
We have other ways.

66
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:22,021
Now, America is built on sacrifice.

67
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:25,027
<i>From the revolution all the way until World War II.

68
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:28,037
<i>Our forefathers sacrificed themselves.

69
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:31,044
Everybody look alive.

70
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:32,048
Understandably, we watched them.

71
00:06:32,052 --> 00:06:38,046
Must sacrifice every year in order to rid ourselves...

72
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:42,042
You know what I said. She moves, we move.

73
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:45,023


74
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,037
Now the stats are undeniable.
There has been far less crime...

75
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,034
This is crap. So I have to listen to this?

76
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,050
Send me to the principal's office.
I can't listen to this anymore.

77
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:54,047
Okay, we'll send you to the principal's office

78
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:56,024
if you can't keep your mouth shut.

79
00:06:56,028 --> 00:07:01,037
More low-income people are killed
during the Purge than anyone else.

80
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:07,041
The money generated from the purge line the
pockets of the NRA and insurance companies.

81
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:10,039
Any government system that relies on violence

82
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:12,039
to answer its problems must be...

83
00:07:12,043 --> 00:07:14,136
She's doing good, Leo.

84
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:22,030
It's time to call upon the better angels of our nature.

85
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,046


86
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:26,050
At least, we will keep trying.

87
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:29,041
Jesus Christ, here she goes again.

88
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:32,028
Secure the audience.
I'm on it.

89
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:33,227
I'd like to talk to you guys.

90
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:36,028
Well, at least he was doing it, boss.

91
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:39,045
She's no good to anyone dead.
You got it, Leo,

92
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:44,045
Okay, we're on the move.
<i>Copy that.

93
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:49,039
Please sit down.
I'd like to stay here with you for the rest of the night.

94
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:51,049
Stay cool and keep it tight.

95
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,033
For purge and purifying.
For purge and purifying.

96
00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:56,430
Hi, thanks.

97
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:03,041
<i>As she'd done many times before,

98
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:07,040
<i>Senator Roan broke security
protocol walking off the stage...

99
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,038
I'll tell you this much.

100
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:13,035
She got some little tits but
she's got some big assed balls.

101
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,045
She ain't got no snowball chance
on steambath in winning this thing,

102
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:21,039
but she'll be taking on 'em all those white-haired
George Washington wannabe mofo's all by herself.

103
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,033
And to that, I say bully for her.

104
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,049
Oh, horse shit. She's full of it too.

105
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,040
Nothing'll ever change.

106
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:28,042
Hey, Laney. Laney, Laney,

107
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:32,237
I think we offend Marcos with our anti senator talk.

108
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,727
The senator's going to win.

109
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:36,047
It doesn't mean it'll be changes too.

110
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:39,048
You see. All she need is Florida.

111
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,042
She gets the 29 electoral votes from Florida,

112
00:08:42,045 --> 00:08:44,332
that will take her to over 270.

113
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:47,048
She can do it.
Smartass.

114
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:50,651
All that useless shit can't buttered them bagel correctly.

115
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:53,045
I can butter your bagel, boss.

116
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:55,033
Oh, you're butter my bagel?

117
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:57,032
Well, you got a joke over there.

118
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:01,023
Yes, you just be careful, kid, with all that hope
because it can be a bad thing.

119
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:03,026
Hope can lead to a lot of letdown.

120
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:07,030
Tell him I'm Irish, huh?
Excuse me, what?

121
00:09:07,031 --> 00:09:09,021
I'm not paying attention.

122
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:11,040
I'm thinking about waffle and pussy.

123
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,038
That's all I really think about actually.

124
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,038
Irish Ike, ladies and gentlemen.

125
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:19,028
What are you laughing at? I'm damn serious.

126
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:22,026


127
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:27,029


128
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,035
The new founding fathers believe in fairness.

129
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,037
And we hear what the people are saying.

130
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,046
<i>That the purge benefits the rich and the powerful.
It was never the intention.

131
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:41,050
From this point on, no one is exempt.

132
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:45,034
The rules protecting Level 10 government officials

133
00:09:45,038 --> 00:09:47,035
Yeah, come in.
<i>had been revoked.

134
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:48,034
Are you seeing this?

135
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:50,034
The NFFA is revoking the purge rules

136
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:53,034
that protects government officials
of ranking 10 on purge night.

137
00:09:53,035 --> 00:09:56,029
Yeah, I'll secure the safehouse and
full security detail on that night.

138
00:09:56,032 --> 00:09:58,038
No, I'm staying home on purge night.

139
00:09:58,043 --> 00:10:00,036
Senator, I don't think that's a good idea.

140
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:04,032
If the voters get wind that I'm hiding
in a fortress like some rich asshole,

141
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,033
I'll lose votes and NFFA wins.

142
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:10,027
I'll stay home like 99 % of the population.

143
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,047
Make it safe, whatever it takes.

144
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:17,044
Right.

145
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:24,044


146
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,035


147
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:34,025
Half the price on all the masks.

148
00:10:34,026 --> 00:10:37,025
Come on inside.

149
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:41,049
The purge is halloween for adults!

150
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:44,030


151
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:48,033
Hordes of young adults are arriving
from Spain, Denmark, South Africa.

152
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:52,024
They're being called "murder tourists"
because they're here for one reason.

153
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:53,034
To purge.

154
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:55,032
We have to experience the purge.

155
00:10:55,032 --> 00:10:58,031
To kill. Release of the anger and hate.

156
00:10:58,035 --> 00:11:01,029
Like the Americans. We're very excited.

157
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:03,245
<i>[Speaking Danish]

158
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:06,846

Murder tourism,
a new building business in our country this year.

160
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,030
Murder tourism.

161
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,050
What's happened to our country, Joe?

162
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:18,040
Mrs Sabian, I wish I knew.

163

You take care of yourself, Mrs S.

164
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:22,041
Next time you need something, just give us a call.

165
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,040
I'll have Marcos run it over, saving you a trip, okay?

166
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:29,038
I come by to flirt with you, Joe.
What?

167
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,035
No one can take that from me.

168
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,044
Ah, you better get out of here.

169
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:37,036
Get out of here. Get out of here.
Oh, yes.

170
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:39,038
Now, she's nasty.
Oh, I like you.

171
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:42,042
She's nasty. That's a nasty woman.

172
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,243
Joe, come here.

173
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:02,788
Sonabitch.

174
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:07,041
Where's he gone?

175
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:09,042
I've never saw him move so damn fast.

176
00:12:09,046 --> 00:12:12,036
Alright, girls. Give it up.
I won't have to call the police.

00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:15,026
Just get out of our face, old man.

178
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,029
Let's not do this the hard way, okay?

179
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,049
I'm giving you a way out.

180
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,033
Right?
Give up the candy or I'll have to take it away from you.

181
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:29,537
You touch me and I'll screamed rape,
you cocksucking pig.

182
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:31,044
Now, walk away.

183
00:12:31,044 --> 00:12:32,544
Give it back.

184
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:35,461
Who are you, bitch?

185
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:37,041
Better get out of my way!

186
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:40,039
That's Laney Rucker, Kimmy.

187
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:43,029
Laney Rucker?

188
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:46,038
No shit.

189
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:50,036
Oh, the queen badass?

190
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:54,023
Yo, they call you the "redeemer".

191
00:12:54,027 --> 00:12:56,050
"Near death".

192
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,044
You're my motherfucking hero.

193
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:02,037
That makes me proud.

194
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:05,031
Now give back whatever you stole.

195
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:09,031
And apologize.

196
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:11,048
Oh, my God..

197
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:18,032
Sorry Mister. I am just playing.

198
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:23,030
So, Miss Rucker...

199
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:25,039
...what happened to you?

200
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,039
You look all... whitish now.

201
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:33,030
Later, Miss Rucker.

202
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:36,047
Wish I'd met you back in the day.

203
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:41,028
Excuse me.

204
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:50,039
Uh, well ..

205
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:54,033
You are lot more respectful then
when you were shoplifting here.

206
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:57,026
You know,
I distinctly remember one time you call me "sir".

207
00:13:57,026 --> 00:13:58,046
Oh, bullshit.

208
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,044
But listen, I just wanna say thank you.

209
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:05,023
You're my family, Joe.

210
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,050
I appreciate it.

211
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:10,031
Thank you, Laney.

212
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:16,042


213
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:18,755
I want men in there. I want men in there.

214
00:14:18,755 --> 00:14:20,045
I want a lot of men back there.

215
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:23,032
She's got some security but I
moved back the entire team.

216
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:27,023
I want barricades on all the doors,
all the windows, back and front.

217
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:28,023
Looks safe.

218
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,036
Chief, if you tell me it's safe one more time,
I'm gonna throw you down the steps.

219
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,023
Please don't do that.

220
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:35,030
Men here.

221
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,230
Men here.

222
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,030
We've got a security monitoring system in this room.

223
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,233
We've got eyes and ears on everything.

224
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:44,047
This is her saferoom. She is not to leave her saferoom.

225
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:48,035
No one is to go inside her saferoom.
Do we understand each other?

226
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:50,032
This is a mess. She's nopt gonna be happy about it.

227
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:51,038
I don't care if she's happy, Chief.

228
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:55,025
I want to go on record to say this is a bad idea.

229
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:57,028
No matter what we do here, this house

230
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,028
and the Senator are at risk on purge night.
You understand me?

231
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:04,026
Duly noted. Let's lock it down.

232
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:06,037
"Let's lock it down.".

233
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,049
It's just me and you, pal.

234
00:15:08,654 --> 00:15:10,047
Tell me what you want me to do, I'm here.

235
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:13,034
Go downstairs. Make sure they take care of the doors.
Keep an eye on that guy.

236
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,431
Done.

237
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:26,429
<i>The NFFA has created predatorial capitalism.
Profit is the esence of democracy.

238
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:29,038
We come to DC to make some changes.

239
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:34,022


240
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:35,029
Joe's deli.

241
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,037
Excuse me?

242
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:43,836
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Wait a minute.

243
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,043
Why are you raising my rates now?

244
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:48,037
Today. You know what today is?

245
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,951
Yes but, look, I ..I can't afford that.

246
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:51,051


247
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,034
What do you mean you're sorry?

248
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:55,041
Yes, I'm talking to you. Let me speak to your sup...

249
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:57,028
Your sup...

250
00:15:57,028 --> 00:15:58,048
Son of a bitch.

251
00:15:58,052 --> 00:16:00,222
Son of a bitch!
Joe?

252
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:05,043
What the hell's going on?
Damn insurance company.

253
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:07,048
They'd just raised the premium of my purge coverage...

254
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,229
...by thousands.

255
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:10,630
The say before the day of purge.

256
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,036
If I don't pay it by tomorrow,
I have no purge coverage for this store.

257
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,043
They can't do that.
Yeah, but they just did.

258
00:16:17,047 --> 00:16:19,030
Just lock the place down, Joe.

259
00:16:19,034 --> 00:16:20,050
Yeah, but that's not enough.

260
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:24,031
If I have no insurance, I am screwed.

261
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:29,037
I just have to protect this place myself.

262
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:31,032
Are you crazy?
That's not a good idea, boss.

263
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:34,029
Listen, we love this place as you do, Joe.
I've been coming here since I was born.

264
00:16:34,032 --> 00:16:37,026
But it's just stuff. It can be replaced.

265
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:38,032
You can't be.

266
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:42,026
Yeah, but what about what you
do on purge night, Laney? Huh?

267
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:45,039
Is that not the pot calling the kettle brown, no?

268
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:47,040
That's different, Joe, and you know that.

269
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:51,034
I'm protected. And you won't be.

270
00:16:53,037 --> 00:16:55,047
This... This is all I've got, guys.

271
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:58,045
This is my slice of the pie.

272
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:03,025
Man, I cannot. I can't lose this place.

273
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:05,428
I just... I can't lose this place.

274
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:12,025
Come on, Joe. Let's talk about this.

275
00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:24,043


276
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:42,032
Everything is in place.

277
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,526
The team's in position.

278
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:47,029
10 minutes to lockdown, boys.

279
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:35,030
Hey, mamma.

280
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,047
You ready?

281
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:39,024
Yeah.

282
00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:41,024
Vaya condios.

283
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:43,031
Okay, let's go.

284
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:51,032
Okay.

285
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,026
This is gonna be your home for the next 12 hours.
If you need anything,

286
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:57,046
you contact me, and me only. Clear?
Clear.

287
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,040
Let's begin.

288
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,023


289
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,026


290
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:27,023
<i>This is not a test.

I see you, Bobby.

307
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,037
You know, you can relax now, right?

308
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:47,036
I'll relax in the morning.

309
00:20:50,028 --> 00:20:51,051
Am I interrupting?

310
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:54,051
Senator, you should be in the den.

311
00:20:56,028 --> 00:20:58,044
I want to thank you for being here tonight.
My pleasure.

312
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:00,042
Leo, have drink with me.

313
00:21:03,452 --> 00:21:05,049
You don't have a choice.

314
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,132
Sound serious.

315
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:09,232
Don't say a word.

316
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,049
Or I'll stick my foot in your arse.

317
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,050
Sit.

318
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,038
It's water, Leo.

319
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:38,026
Are you scared?

320
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:42,033
I'm terrified.

321
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:49,039
What made you apply for this position?

322
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:52,041
I liked your politics.

323
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,037
No.

324
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,021
No horse-shit. I want real answer.

325
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:05,025
I lost my son some years ago.

326
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:06,051
He was killed.

327
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:13,033
I must have done something on night purge that would
have destroyed a lot of lives. I want this night gone.

328
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:16,045
I know you did too.

329
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:19,036
Especially, after what you've lost.

330
00:22:20,027 --> 00:22:21,033
Yeah.

331
00:22:21,054 --> 00:22:24,027
But despite all that, you...

332
00:22:24,027 --> 00:22:27,021
...you're having problems with how I do things.

333
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:29,024
You take risks, senator.

334
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:32,044
My job is to eliminate risks and keep you alive.

335
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:35,024
You don't make that easy.

336
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:38,042
The soul of this country is at stake, Leo.

337
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:40,041
The only way I can win is to risk ..

338
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:41,041
...everything.

339
00:22:41,046 --> 00:22:44,025
And that includes my life.

340
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:46,038
Well..

341
00:22:56,047 --> 00:22:59,030
<i>It is time to purge!

342
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:03,040
Come on!

343
00:23:03,044 --> 00:23:05,034
I hope your night of fun.

344
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:07,037
Don't you see we're working?

345
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:13,035
Hey! Asshole!

346
00:23:13,052 --> 00:23:17,039
Just go wait right here and see what happens.

347
00:23:17,052 --> 00:23:20,025
Purge!

348
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:23,046
They probably won't bother us, okay?

349
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,033
Hey .. dear.

350
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,037
Purge..

351
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,044
Go, go, go, go! Let's move!

352
00:24:24,744 --> 00:24:28,244
Stop! Stop! Please stop!
Please help him!

353
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:30,544
Oh, something's going down.

354
00:24:31,144 --> 00:24:33,704
Hey, looks like there's somebody who
needs our services. Let's go. Let's do this.

355
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:35,404
Stop.

356
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,870
I shot my husband.

357
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,000
Calm down. Tell me what happened.

358
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:06,200
Hey, boss!
It's me. It's me.

359
00:25:06,335 --> 00:25:07,678
Come on out of there, boy.

360
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:12,208
Good lord, son.

361
00:25:12,808 --> 00:25:15,208
It's purge night. You gonna sneak up on black people?

362
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:20,708
Good night blue jesus! Where the hell are you going?

363
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:22,708
And why are you carrying the chair?

364
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:23,608
I like sitting.

365
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,188
Yeah, but you ain't gonna be staying.

366
00:25:27,508 --> 00:25:29,778
You know I appreciate you coming
out here to watch my back

367
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,208
but I'm good. I got this.

368
00:25:31,408 --> 00:25:35,208
No, I'll stay. Nothing else to do.

369
00:25:35,508 --> 00:25:37,118
Please don't be a pain in the ass.

370
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,118
I want you to go home. You'll be safe.

371
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:42,718
I don't want you out here on purge night, son.
I got this.

372
00:27:17,718 --> 00:27:20,218
Happy purge, you old fuck!

373
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,168
You better find some place else to go.

374
00:27:24,168 --> 00:27:27,168
I have got a sweet tooth tonight.

375
00:27:28,122 --> 00:27:29,868
And I want my candy bar.

376
00:27:30,768 --> 00:27:31,868
And I'm gonna take it.

377
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:35,208
You don't have the balls to stop me.

378
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,488
I have the balls.

379
00:27:40,888 --> 00:27:41,888
Now, go!

380
00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:49,138
I'd already took care of my mom and dad tonight.

381
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,138
You're next!

382
00:27:51,888 --> 00:27:53,838
<i>I want my candy bar, cocksucker!

383
00:27:55,438 --> 00:27:56,458
Come on!

384
00:28:19,118 --> 00:28:20,758
What's up with that?

385
00:28:21,218 --> 00:28:23,708
Everyday in Juarez I'd like to purge. 345 00:28:24,408
--> 00:28:25,888 I know how to shoot, boss.

386
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:32,258
Son, I really wish you would stay home.

387
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,250
How long.
It's that time.

388
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,300
Erick.

389
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,210
"We are set."

390
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,620
still we're fine, you
the turn of the first floor.

391
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,330
- Do you mind?
- No

392
00:29:33,960 --> 00:59:07,380
Yes, boss.

393
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,920


394
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,150
Chief, find the bedroom.
I got it from here.

395
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,150
Alright, Leo.

396
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,210
Boys, who don't you take a break?
Go to watch some TV, huh?

397
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,770


398
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,210
It's gonna be a long night.
Thank you, sir.

399
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,330
I'm coming outside, boys.

400
00:31:57,038 --> 00:31:59,044
How are you doing out there, Bobby?

401
00:32:05,412 --> 00:32:07,025
Sniper 1, radio check.

402
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:14,045
Bobby, radio check.

403
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:19,030
Sniper 2, radio check. Sniper 2.

404
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:46,038
Someone's coming for you.

405
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,048
What?
Wear it.

406
00:32:47,053 --> 00:32:50,029
Leo, the house is surrounded....
Move, move.

407
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,020
I'm moving. What are you...?

408
00:32:52,023 --> 00:32:55,036
You said you had men on the roof. You had snipers.
Not any more. Not any more.

409
00:32:55,037 --> 00:32:56,046
What do you mean "not anymore"?
Someone betrayed us.

410
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:00,037
What?
I can't trust anyone. Put on that vest!

411
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:06,028
Listen to me! This isn't a drill.

412
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:08,044
Someone's coming to kill you, you understand me?

413
00:33:08,045 --> 00:33:11,035
Move.
I'm moving.

414
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:14,028
Go!
Okay, what the hell is that?

415
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:15,048
This is my little secret. Move!

416
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:18,025
One two three!

417
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:20,045
Okay.

418
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:36,040
Boss.

419
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:38,027
Leo, it's me.

420
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:41,041
Fuck!

421
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:45,032
Where the hell is she?
Jesus Christ!

422
00:34:15,405 --> 00:34:16,042
What the fuck is this?

423
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:33,439
I don't know what the fuck that is.

424
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:49,047
The mark may be outside. I repeat ..

425
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:52,031
The mark may be outside.

426
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,031
Check your perimeters.

427
00:35:03,453 --> 00:35:05,326
No payment unless you find her.

428
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,088
Fuck!

429
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:12,027
I see her!

430
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,039
Stay down!

431
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,030
Move. Go!

432
00:35:55,035 --> 00:35:56,202
Go, go, go!

433
00:36:12,027 --> 00:36:13,032
Hey, guys. You up there?

434
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,042
That Laney?

435
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,023
Marcos!

436
00:36:19,031 --> 00:36:21,043
Oh, my God. How are you doing tonight?

437
00:36:21,351 --> 00:36:23,034
We're good. You?

438
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:26,128
Uh, I just dropped someone off at triage.

439
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:31,048
His wife shot him because she couldn't
stand looking at his face anymore.

440
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:37,025
She said purging didn't make her feel any
better like they said it would.

441
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,039
Stay safe, Laney.

442
00:36:39,403 --> 00:36:41,029
Anything happens.

443
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,032
Do not hesitate to call us.

444
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:46,032
Yeah, same goes for you.

445
00:36:46,043 --> 00:36:48,030
Okay?
Alright.

446
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:49,039
Alright.

447
00:36:59,035 --> 00:37:01,637
God, I hate that she sounds going like that.

448
00:37:08,445 --> 00:37:10,039
Stop, stop!

449
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:18,029
What..? What is this? Some kind of homegrown militia?

450
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:20,046
Those are skilled mercs. A lot of money behind it.

451
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,044
Enough to get to some of our staff.
I'm guessing it's the Minister.

452
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:28,031
Minister of the NFFA.
Fucking liar. I'm getting too close.

453
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:40,035
There's a lot of blood, Leo. We should call someone.

454
00:37:40,035 --> 00:37:43,029
I don't know who to trust anymore here.
You understand me?

455
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:45,035
Okay.

456
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:46,045
Where do we go?

457
00:37:46,453 --> 00:37:50,036
East. Out of the city. There are a lot of threats.

458
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,029
And a lot of deaths.

459
00:38:06,038 --> 00:38:09,025
<i>Purge sanitation services.

460
00:38:09,028 --> 00:38:14,035
<i>Dead collection.
Purge victims removal and disposed.

461
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,048
<i>Keep watch and stay clear.</i>
Its okay.

462
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,209
This sounds good to go now.

463
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:25,609
Like you said,

464
00:38:26,853 --> 00:38:29,337
the fate of the country is at stake, okay?

465
00:38:30,037 --> 00:38:31,027
It's my show now.

466
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:33,050
Look, I'm not an idiot.

467
00:38:34,031 --> 00:38:36,451
I know what you're capable of.
I'm the one who hired you.

468
00:38:36,451 --> 00:38:40,028
If I see something I don't like,
I'm not going to be quiet about it. It's not in my nature.

469
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:42,030
Senator...

470
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:45,025
I need you to follow me.

471
00:38:46,045 --> 00:38:48,025
Come on.

472
00:39:07,404 --> 00:39:11,047
It's Tommy, sir. He's in bad shape.
He's unconscious.

473
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:13,041
Everyone else up there is dead.

474
00:39:13,445 --> 00:39:16,042
Well, get him to the ground units, get him stablised.

475
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:19,048
Then start street surveillance. I'll search from above.

476
00:39:20,045 --> 00:39:23,048
I want him alive, so let's find him before the crazies do.

477
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:25,029
Sir.

478
00:39:35,037 --> 00:39:37,034
They're tracking us.

479
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:40,046
Where? I don't see them, how could they see us?

480
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:46,338
Mercenaries?

481
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:47,738
No.

482
00:39:48,545 --> 00:39:51,044
That's a home-made drone. Purgers.

483
00:39:54,545 --> 00:39:55,051
Now what?

484
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,038
Run...

485
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:01,026
...fast.

486
00:40:26,032 --> 00:40:27,041
Come on, come on, come on.

487
00:40:41,547 --> 00:40:45,200
It's behind you, Leo. 35 yards back, 15 yards high.

488
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,047
Get down!

489
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:57,027
The reason why I'm so hard to you, son, like I am.

490
00:41:57,031 --> 00:42:00,028
Someday, I'd like to make you a partner.

491
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:05,044
Yep, well...
coming here from another country like you did.

492
00:42:06,032 --> 00:42:08,038
Having your own business.

493
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:11,825
The American dream's still alive.

494
00:42:13,026 --> 00:42:15,045


495
00:42:17,046 --> 00:42:19,036


496
00:42:37,025 --> 00:42:40,024
Fuck you, American cocksuckers!

497
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:51,726
We love your American.
America is the greatest country in the world.

498
00:43:02,034 --> 00:43:05,033
<i>[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

499
00:43:09,442 --> 00:43:13,651
We will little purge.
We will torture you and violate your flesh.

500
00:43:13,651 --> 00:43:14,201
Never!

501
00:43:14,201 --> 00:43:17,632
Remove your skin and share your blood.

502
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:21,029
This is the American...

503
00:43:21,029 --> 00:43:24,029


504
00:43:36,028 --> 00:43:37,044
Senator.

505
00:43:42,044 --> 00:43:44,131
Come with us.

506
00:44:17,552 --> 00:44:21,045
Stay here.
Yes, yes.

507
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:26,236
This is my place.

508
00:44:27,036 --> 00:44:29,045
You can stay all night if you want to.

509
00:44:30,036 --> 00:44:35,027
Now, I gotta ask you cause I'm just a nosy old dog.

510
00:44:35,043 --> 00:44:39,037
What in Mississippi fuck was you
doing outside on purge night, Senator?

511
00:44:40,031 --> 00:44:46,034
Yeah. There was an assassination attempt on... me.

512
00:44:46,048 --> 00:44:48,041
I can't thank you enough.

513
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:50,028
Sir, I'm sorry, I dicn't know you know me.

514
00:44:50,032 --> 00:44:52,048
Dixon. You can call me Joe, senator.

515
00:44:52,052 --> 00:44:55,042
Joe, I'm Charlie.
Charlie.

516
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:58,029
That's, uh, that's Marcos right there.

517
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:01,038
Marcos is a... is a fan of yours.

518
00:45:01,043 --> 00:45:03,029
Hi, Marcos.
Senator.

519
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,026
He actually thinks you can win this thing.
Oh, yeah?

520
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:10,027
Shit. Tell her what she needs to do to win, Marcos.

521
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,050
Go on. It's not my business here.

522
00:45:11,054 --> 00:45:16,037
You saved my life, Marcos. Can't wait to hear it, please.

523
00:45:17,038 --> 00:45:19,044
Florida is the key.

524
00:45:20,035 --> 00:45:22,031
You have to get the elders.

525
00:45:23,025 --> 00:45:26,051
Smart. He's not wrong.
Joe, what do you think?

526
00:45:26,552 --> 00:45:29,032
I don't think you got a damn chance.

527
00:45:29,035 --> 00:45:31,035
Well, have a little faith.

528
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,033
Well, I lost my faith in the system
long time ago, Senator. Water?

529
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:37,045
Thank you.
This place is moderately secured.

530
00:45:37,546 --> 00:45:40,049
Cameras. Maybe we should stay here.

531
00:45:41,052 --> 00:45:42,039
'Maybe we stay here"?

532
00:45:42,443 --> 00:45:44,043
What... you going... you going out back there yourself?
Joe.

533
00:45:44,047 --> 00:45:47,046
You have a first-aid kit? Leo, my security was shot.

534
00:45:47,451 --> 00:45:49,044
I'm fine.
You're not fine.

535
00:45:49,044 --> 00:45:53,021
I'm fine.
You're not. Sit!

536
00:45:54,805 --> 00:45:56,127
You want me to take it off?

537
00:45:59,028 --> 00:46:00,048


538
00:46:01,042 --> 00:46:05,022
It's okay. It's nothing.
Yeah? Don't look like nothing.

539
00:46:07,049 --> 00:46:11,022
Let me see.
I know a little about first aid. I can help you.

540
00:46:15,037 --> 00:46:17,049
The bullet's deep. You need stitches.
Yeah.

541
00:46:17,054 --> 00:46:21,037
We can do it here.
Right. Clean it up, patch it. Go on.

542
00:46:23,044 --> 00:46:25,024
Quick, come on.

543
00:46:27,408 --> 00:46:29,045
What about you guys? Who are you?

544
00:46:29,048 --> 00:46:31,045
Is this necessary?
It's very necesary.

545
00:46:31,045 --> 00:46:33,028
You. What's your name? Where are you from?

546
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:35,035
Marcos Perez, Mexico City.

547
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:37,032
But I've been American citizen for 2 years.

548
00:46:37,036 --> 00:46:40,038
You got a record?
Not here.

549
00:46:40,043 --> 00:46:43,022
What did you do in Mexico?

550
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,036
I try to survive.

551
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:48,036
What're you doing out on purge night?

552
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,039
Protecting the deli against looters because
my boss lost his purge insurance yesterday.

553
00:46:52,044 --> 00:46:54,050
Yeah, that's something you can look into, Senator.

554
00:46:55,027 --> 00:46:57,027
Insurance company screwing the working man.

555
00:46:57,028 --> 00:46:58,037
Yeah?

556
00:46:58,408 --> 00:47:00,038
What's your name, pal?

557
00:47:00,405 --> 00:47:02,044
You know what, Mr Secret Service man.

558
00:47:02,044 --> 00:47:05,044
You should be thanking my black ass
for helping you instead of interrogating me.

559
00:47:05,445 --> 00:47:08,035
His name is Joe Dixon.
Joe Dixon, did I offended you?

560
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:09,041
Yeah, friend. Just a little bit.

561
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:11,022
Your feeling is not a concern of mine.

562
00:47:11,026 --> 00:47:12,042


563
00:47:12,442 --> 00:47:14,045
Everyone. Shut up, please!

564
00:47:15,023 --> 00:47:16,039
Look!

565
00:47:32,028 --> 00:47:34,027
Come out, you bitch!

566
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:38,025
Sound the alert and start the fire!

567
00:47:48,026 --> 00:47:51,023
Oh hell.
Who the hell is that?

568
00:47:51,026 --> 00:47:52,042
The looters I was telling you about.

569
00:47:52,043 --> 00:47:54,049
It's purge night, senator. What so you expect?

570
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:58,027
Hey, you fuck!

571
00:48:00,027 --> 00:48:01,024
I'm back!

572
00:48:03,028 --> 00:48:04,230
And I brought some friends.

573
00:48:05,034 --> 00:48:07,021
<i>And I'm gonna get that candy bar.

574
00:48:07,021 --> 00:48:08,351
They have chainsaws and they're coming inside.

575
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:10,034
All right, I gotta get you out of here.

576
00:48:10,035 --> 00:48:11,352
Yeah, but they're at both entrances.

577
00:48:11,352 --> 00:48:15,028
Then I'm gonna purge and kill you
and burn this bitch to the ground.

578
00:48:15,032 --> 00:48:16,045
I gotta call her.

579
00:48:17,032 --> 00:48:17,778
Who?

580
00:48:17,778 --> 00:48:20,038
We have a friend out there with a triage van.

581
00:48:20,423 --> 00:48:22,029
You trust this friend?

582
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:24,049
And you're still questioning my integrity.

583
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:27,049
Boy, you are a piece of mark, man.

584
00:48:29,037 --> 00:48:31,027
Come on, come on. Pick up.

585
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,024
This bastard, bastard in this place, I had to go back.

586
00:48:34,027 --> 00:48:35,037
No, no, you're not going anywhere.

587
00:48:35,041 --> 00:48:37,031
I already told your mom, I'll take care of you.

588
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:39,037
Hurry, quick, and perbanlah so I could go out again ..

589
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,038
Promise me you'll be home tonight.

590
00:48:41,038 --> 00:48:46,041
I wanna purge tonight. I wanna...
Laney! What? Laney!

591
00:48:47,032 --> 00:48:49,208
Really?
Yeah, for real.

592
00:48:49,442 --> 00:48:54,036
You heard me right. Senator Roan.
Call me back, Laney. We need you bad.

593
00:48:55,409 --> 00:48:56,336
She'll call back.

594
00:48:57,036 --> 00:49:00,039
We can't count on your friend.
These kids will be here soon.

595
00:49:02,027 --> 00:49:03,043
What do we do?

596
00:49:04,377 --> 00:49:08,034
Okay, we will work as a team to protect these woman.

597
00:49:08,044 --> 00:49:11,027
You all understand what's at stake here, yes?

598
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,030
Yes?!

599
00:49:12,034 --> 00:49:13,037
Yes.
Alright.

600
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:19,044
We are gonna purge today.

601
00:49:19,404 --> 00:49:25,688
We are gonna purge today. Burn this bitch down.

602
00:49:27,453 --> 00:49:28,629
Fuck!

603
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:31,042
Okay, you take the back. I'll take the front.

604
00:49:31,043 --> 00:49:32,045
I'll take the front with you.

605
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:34,040
No. You're not gonna be in the front line.

606
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,037
Are you crazy? Leo, give me a gun.

607
00:49:36,037 --> 00:49:39,030
I will give you a gun but you're not on the front line.
Over my dead body.

608
00:49:39,034 --> 00:49:41,031
You better drop dead.

609
00:49:41,037 --> 00:49:43,027
I think he's right, Senator.

610
00:49:43,031 --> 00:49:44,233
Thank you, deli man.

611
00:49:44,233 --> 00:49:47,037
Deli man? I agree with you and you still...

612
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:49,051
Okay, enough! Executive decision.

613
00:49:50,032 --> 00:49:53,028
I'm with Leo. We need as many guns as we can get.

614
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:55,034


615
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:00,139
Go, go, go!

616
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:02,039
Move, move, move!

617
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,039
Get down here.

618
00:50:07,343 --> 00:50:08,527
Just point and shoot.

619
00:50:09,127 --> 00:50:11,027
Do not shoot me.

620
00:50:20,025 --> 00:50:23,034
<i>If I want some candy, I'll take some candy.

621
00:50:22,025 --> 00:50:23,034


622
00:50:23,038 --> 00:50:25,225
I'll take whatever the fuck I want.

623
00:50:26,035 --> 00:50:28,044
My mom's not gonna like this.

624
00:50:28,049 --> 00:50:30,048
It's purge night.

625
00:50:30,409 --> 00:50:35,032
Me getting mine,
you getting yours and there's nobody stopping anybody.

626
00:50:35,036 --> 00:50:37,029
Bye, bye, motherfucker!

627
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,429
Say goodnight, cocksucker,
because here comes your candygirl!

628
00:50:46,404 --> 00:50:47,246
Here they come.

629
00:50:57,045 --> 00:50:59,021
Motherfuckers!

630
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,039
Hold on!

631
00:51:32,425 --> 00:51:33,242
Wait here.

632
00:52:09,029 --> 00:52:12,031
The redeemer is back, bitches.

633
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:17,026
<i>Hey, guys.

634
00:52:17,626 --> 00:52:18,726
<i>I got your message.

635
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,046
Laney!

636
00:52:22,027 --> 00:52:23,336
This is our girl.

637
00:52:29,547 --> 00:52:31,034
Holy shit. It really is you.

638
00:52:31,434 --> 00:52:33,024
Where do we go?
There.

639
00:52:33,124 --> 00:52:36,034
Go.
Come on, Joe.

640
00:52:36,035 --> 00:52:38,034
I'll be with you in a minute. I'll be there.

641
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:44,029
Joe, come on.

642
00:52:44,209 --> 00:52:46,529
You've get out of here, kid. I'm staying.

643
00:52:47,036 --> 00:52:48,109
They'll kill you.

644
00:52:48,109 --> 00:52:49,210
Go now!

645
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,039
If you stay, I stay.

646
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,226
Just leave!

647
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:56,032
Joe, listen to me.

648
00:52:56,037 --> 00:52:58,046
For some reason,
the Senator ended up in my neighbourhood

649
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,341
and your deli.

650
00:52:59,741 --> 00:53:02,041
Maybe it's our duty to help protect her.

651
00:53:03,028 --> 00:53:05,040
We'll rebuild the deli, whatever it takes, you and me.

652
00:53:05,044 --> 00:53:06,135
I promise.

653
00:53:06,535 --> 00:53:08,135
Come on, guys. Now!

654
00:53:19,409 --> 00:53:20,329
Where are we headed?

655
00:53:21,726 --> 00:53:24,200
Underground triage centre service in the community.

656
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,209
It's completely secure.

657
00:53:39,044 --> 00:53:42,028


658
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:44,031
Extend our perimeter.

659
00:53:44,335 --> 00:53:46,222
They're on foot. They can't be far.

660
00:53:46,725 --> 00:53:48,431
Earl, spoke with the ground units.

661
00:53:49,035 --> 00:53:51,032
Tommy regained consciousness.

662
00:53:51,032 --> 00:53:53,048
Said he had a shot off at the senator's security.

663
00:53:53,049 --> 00:53:56,029
He thinks the bullet is lodged in his shoulder.

664
00:53:56,029 --> 00:53:58,026


665
00:54:17,032 --> 00:54:20,034


666
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:23,029
How the hell did it get to this?

667
00:54:32,043 --> 00:54:34,026
Who is he?

668
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,043
Why is he cuffed?

669
00:54:35,407 --> 00:54:40,034
Rondo. Two bullet holes delivered by a rival gang,
but he's a good kid.

670
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:43,050
He's chained up because I didn't
want him to purge anymore.

671
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:48,024
So, Senator...

672
00:54:48,031 --> 00:54:50,041
NFFA made a move on your ass.

673
00:54:50,388 --> 00:54:51,645
Seems that way.

674
00:54:53,032 --> 00:54:58,048
Goddamn conniving, duplicities, crooked,
cocksucking politicians.

675
00:54:58,552 --> 00:55:00,046
Agree.

676
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:02,329
We're not all that bad.

677
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:07,036
From my experience, Senator,
might be better on your own.

678
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,036
No matter what you all say or promise ..

679
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,039
I'm partly confused too.

680
00:55:11,044 --> 00:55:13,046
Who the hell is this lady?

681
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:17,050
You big dope.
You gave people from the neighborhood a bad name.

682
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:20,027


683
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:26,048
Oh, it's just some purgers.

684
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:29,051
It's cross fire.

685
00:55:30,029 --> 00:55:31,649
Not for us.

686
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:37,049
Ah, it feels like you're close.

687
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:39,039
How do you know each other?

688
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,233
Joe gave me the job seven years ago
when I first came here from Mexico.

689
00:55:44,037 --> 00:55:45,739
I've been working for him ever since.

690
00:55:46,044 --> 00:55:48,030
And you?

691
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:50,043
Joe's been looking out for me since I was a little kid.

692
00:55:51,024 --> 00:55:53,030
And he helps me get out of life.

693
00:55:54,035 --> 00:55:56,041
Sounds like Joe is a saint.

694
00:55:56,048 --> 00:55:58,051
Yeah. Well, I ain't no saint.

695
00:55:59,025 --> 00:56:01,024
I'm just doing my part.

696
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:07,323
Driving round in a van,
on the purge night, helping people?

697
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:09,045
It's pretty dangerous.

698
00:56:10,026 --> 00:56:13,036
I'm working for a triage unit alone.

699
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,033
It's true, for most part.

700
00:56:17,027 --> 00:56:21,020
Seriously, Laney. Who the hell are these people?

701
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:23,023


702
00:56:23,051 --> 00:56:25,331
Down! Everyone down!

703
00:56:29,725 --> 00:56:31,448
Anybody hit?
I'm okay, I'm okay.

704
00:56:31,448 --> 00:56:32,051
You sure?
Yeah.

705
00:56:32,452 --> 00:56:35,028
Laney.
I'm okay.

706
00:56:35,032 --> 00:56:36,941
Jesus Christ! Rondo's dead.

707
00:56:36,045 --> 00:56:39,042


708
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:41,053
What the fuck was that?

709
00:56:41,053 --> 00:56:42,423
They've found the senator.

710
00:56:45,776 --> 00:56:47,039
I want you to turn left!

711
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,046
Go on to the freeway. Move! Move!

712
00:56:51,034 --> 00:56:52,046
Tonight!

713
00:56:52,447 --> 00:56:56,731
The gates of hell will always be in a fight to the end.

714
00:56:57,031 --> 00:57:00,247
The survival of the fucking fittest.

715
00:57:00,647 --> 00:57:02,155
Who's the fittest?!

716
00:57:02,401 --> 00:57:05,438
I'm the fittest of them all!

717
00:57:11,396 --> 00:57:12,639
Ow, fuck.

718
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:15,045
Don't lose them under there.

719
00:57:16,036 --> 00:57:17,042
Ground Unit.

720
00:57:17,346 --> 00:57:21,026
Get your asses moving and get here now.
We've got them cornered.

721
00:57:31,051 --> 00:57:33,048


722
00:57:33,051 --> 00:57:36,024


723
00:57:49,026 --> 00:57:50,052
Turn here and stop.

724
00:58:02,787 --> 00:58:03,774
So we just wait here?

725
00:58:03,774 --> 00:58:05,524
No. They'll have units on the ground.

726
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:07,027
They'll gonna be all over us.

727
00:58:07,031 --> 00:58:09,244
Yeah, but we all better figure out
fast cause I don't like it here.

728
00:58:09,244 --> 00:58:10,531
It doesn't make sense.

729
00:58:11,035 --> 00:58:13,041
There was no way they could have
known that we have this van.

730
00:58:13,045 --> 00:58:15,032
It doesn't matter.

731
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:17,029
They did.

732
00:58:23,403 --> 00:58:26,026
You son of a bitch.

733
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:29,046
Leo?

734
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:35,027
Leo?
Move over.

735
00:58:36,044 --> 00:58:38,027
Leo?

736
00:58:45,052 --> 00:58:47,035
Oh.

737
00:58:48,029 --> 00:58:50,031
Leo, what the hell are you doing?

738
00:58:58,026 --> 00:59:01,023
Leo, you...

739
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:05,050
Tracer bullet.

740
00:59:06,027 --> 00:59:07,040
That's how you notice.

741
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:09,031
Just leave it here and drive away.

742
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:10,047
They'll never know we left it.

743
00:59:10,348 --> 00:59:13,024
Yeah, well, I wish it was that simple.

744
00:59:13,028 --> 00:59:15,027
You all need to see this.

745
00:59:19,045 --> 00:59:23,032
There's a whole bunch of negroes coming right this way.

746
00:59:23,032 --> 00:59:26,035
And we're sitting here like a
bucket of motherfucking chicken.

747
00:59:35,047 --> 00:59:38,023


748
00:59:38,044 --> 00:59:40,040
What's your ETA?

749
00:59:41,031 --> 00:59:42,043
2 minutes, Earl.

750
00:59:49,638 --> 00:59:51,028
<i>Open the motherfucking door!

751
00:59:54,042 --> 00:59:55,041
What are we gonna do?

752
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:57,022
They'll start blasting if we move.

753
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:59,031
They'll start blasting if we don't.

754
01:00:00,022 --> 01:00:02,042
Hey, now what are we going to do?

755
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:07,053
What's the plan?

756
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,043
<i>No, no, no. Calm down. Calm down.

757
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:15,030
What the hell is that?

758
01:00:17,051 --> 01:00:21,038
<i>I know what I heard, I know what I heard.

759
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:23,028
I told you I ain't no saint.

760
01:00:23,031 --> 01:00:24,047
Everybody's got a past.

761
01:00:24,052 --> 01:00:28,025
That was a Crip's whistle. They just threw it back.

762
01:00:28,029 --> 01:00:31,031
If this is what I said, we should be good.

763
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:35,326
<i>I know, I know what I heard.

764
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,039
Alright.

765
01:00:42,033 --> 01:00:44,800
We're not going to hurt you. Just help my fucking boy.

766
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,050
He's gonna die.

767
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,027
We help you.

768
01:00:49,031 --> 01:00:51,040
Can you do something for us?

769
01:00:57,035 --> 01:00:59,034
They're still under the overpass but they're on the move.

770
01:00:59,408 --> 01:01:01,041
Get your asses in there.

771
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:13,049
They've stopped.
Stop the truck.

772
01:01:14,807 --> 01:01:16,043
We're going on foot.

773
01:01:36,032 --> 01:01:37,045
Clear!

774
01:01:51,327 --> 01:01:55,034
Earl, we found a tracer bullet.
But there was no sign of the target.

775
01:01:55,037 --> 01:01:57,024
Yeah, we're heading back.

776
01:02:08,042 --> 01:02:10,025
Rondi, come in.

777
01:02:11,036 --> 01:02:13,032
Rondi, come in.

778
01:02:13,049 --> 01:02:16,036
Come in. I need a fucking sitrep.

779
01:02:16,043 --> 01:02:19,040


780
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,423
Fuck you, motherfuckers!

781
01:02:25,344 --> 01:02:26,737
No one following.

782
01:02:27,347 --> 01:02:28,230
We're clear.

783
01:02:29,031 --> 01:02:30,837
We are a few blocks away.

784
01:02:31,338 --> 01:02:34,628
I'm gonna call in and tell them we have a special guest.

785
01:02:58,410 --> 01:02:59,430
Where are we?

786
01:03:00,037 --> 01:03:02,020
You're safe.

787
01:03:07,038 --> 01:03:10,037


788
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,029
What is this place?

789
01:03:23,036 --> 01:03:25,039
We call this the safe zone.

790
01:03:27,037 --> 01:03:30,036
Senator. Dante Bishop.
Mr. Bishop.

791
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,023
This is Angel.

792
01:03:32,027 --> 01:03:35,024
Dawn call and told me you guys are coming through.

793
01:03:36,027 --> 01:03:38,044
So NFFA came messing tonight.

794
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:40,050
Can't say I'm surprised.

795
01:03:41,048 --> 01:03:44,031
Let me show you around. Get yourself a den.

796
01:03:45,352 --> 01:03:49,035
You set all this up, Mr. Bishop?
Yes, this is my organization.

797
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:53,048
We have doctors, nurses, EMTs and paramedics.

798
01:03:53,052 --> 01:03:56,052
This is their way of protesting this day and night.

799
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:03,032
How many people know about this place?

800
01:04:03,033 --> 01:04:05,030
Just the volunteers.

801
01:04:05,034 --> 01:04:07,036
And all those that we invite in.

802
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:12,024
Look, these are the real victims of the Purge.

803
01:04:12,024 --> 01:04:15,021
The people that the NFFA are trying to eliminate.

804
01:04:15,025 --> 01:04:17,044
So that they don't have to take care of them anymore.

805
01:04:20,048 --> 01:04:25,025
These men. They're armed.
Are they guarding all the entrances and the rooftop?

806
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:28,026
Yes. My people will keep you safe.

807
01:04:28,033 --> 01:04:31,026
Or as safe as you can be on purge night.

808
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,023
I appreciate it.

809
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:38,029
Mr. Bishop.
Yeah.

810
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:42,040
Thank you for all of this. I am... impressed.

811
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:46,027
Well, don't thank me. Thank the volunteers.

812
01:04:46,031 --> 01:04:48,028
Mr. Bishop.

813
01:04:48,028 --> 01:04:50,021
I've heard stories...

814
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:54,032
of tactics that you will employ on the purge night.

815
01:04:55,029 --> 01:04:57,035
I can't say that I agree with any of it.

816
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:01,029
Tell you what.

817
01:05:01,043 --> 01:05:05,038
You get elected. You stop this night...

818
01:05:06,033 --> 01:05:08,049
...and I don't have to do what I do anymore.

819
01:05:09,037 --> 01:05:10,049
Let's go, Angel.

820
01:05:12,407 --> 01:05:14,037
Fair enough.

821
01:05:25,035 --> 01:05:27,048
Get down to Fourth street. Keep an eye out.

822
01:05:27,052 --> 01:05:30,045
Keep watch and be quiet.

823
01:05:30,049 --> 01:05:33,025
All right, let's go! Come on.

824
01:06:08,033 --> 01:06:11,030
I want access to the surveillance cameras in the city.

825
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:14,036
Do a grid search for the fucking triage van.

826
01:06:14,047 --> 01:06:18,023
It's out there somewhere. Find it.

827
01:06:24,031 --> 01:06:29,025


828
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:32,029


829
01:06:32,032 --> 01:06:33,037
Boss.

830
01:06:34,042 --> 01:06:36,035
You're doing the right thing.

831
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:39,048
Yeah?

832
01:06:41,036 --> 01:06:43,038
But it's time to go.

833
01:06:43,043 --> 01:06:45,042
And get back to the deli.

834
01:06:45,553 --> 01:06:48,036
What? No. Are you fucking crazy?

835
01:06:48,403 --> 01:06:52,023
We're safe here.
Laney, you know I'll walk back if I have to.

836
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,767
Fine. I'll drive you.

837
01:06:54,767 --> 01:06:57,728
But if we ran into any problems,
we're coming right back here.

838
01:06:57,728 --> 01:06:59,044
Deal.

839
01:07:05,042 --> 01:07:07,044
Is it true? You can do that?

840
01:07:08,035 --> 01:07:10,048
We'll see her again, Marcos.

841
01:07:11,032 --> 01:07:13,031
Well, she's safe here.

842
01:07:13,582 --> 01:07:15,039
Let's hit it.

843
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:23,026
I don't know if you find it amazing but I think it's cool.

844
01:07:25,347 --> 01:07:29,024
Hey. You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

845
01:07:29,451 --> 01:07:32,050
I'm gonna go take a look around.
Okay.

846
01:07:32,554 --> 01:07:33,741
Stay here.

847
01:07:35,031 --> 01:07:36,251
Okay, boss.

848
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:07,047
What are you doing here?

849
01:09:08,034 --> 01:09:09,033
Hand.

850
01:09:09,037 --> 01:09:11,027
Why are you here?

851
01:09:20,042 --> 01:09:22,032
What the hell going on here?
He slipped in here.

852
01:09:22,035 --> 01:09:24,034
Hey, hey. Okay, okay.

853
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:26,041
Hey! Hey!
It's alright. It's alright.

854
01:09:26,046 --> 01:09:28,032
Rev, back up.

855
01:09:28,033 --> 01:09:29,038
It's okay.

856
01:09:29,049 --> 01:09:31,039
Just put the gun down, alright?

857
01:09:31,043 --> 01:09:33,045
Everybody's okay. Backup.

858
01:09:34,233 --> 01:09:35,042
We're okay.

859
01:09:36,453 --> 01:09:38,030
Alright?

860
01:09:38,034 --> 01:09:40,039
Alright? You're good.

861
01:09:40,047 --> 01:09:42,027
It's all good, okay?

862
01:09:42,031 --> 01:09:43,047
I'll just get my weapon.

863
01:09:44,044 --> 01:09:45,050
What's going on?

864
01:09:46,024 --> 01:09:47,027
Just doing my job.

865
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:49,030
Senator, this is just a misunderstanding.

866
01:09:49,035 --> 01:09:51,031
Why don't we go back outside?

867
01:09:51,038 --> 01:09:52,041
Come on.

868
01:09:56,032 --> 01:09:58,048
You seeing this, Leo?
Yes, ma'am.

869
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:02,026
Senator, why don't we go outside?
Stop.

870
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:07,032
Those are the Minister's biggest financial supporters.

871
01:10:08,027 --> 01:10:10,032
The NFFA.

872
01:10:11,354 --> 01:10:13,030
Our Lady Of Sorrow.
Senator, why...

873
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:18,033
Is... Is that where the Minister going to be tonight?
For the purge mass?

874
01:10:18,344 --> 01:10:21,024
We believe so.
You sure...

875
01:10:22,035 --> 01:10:23,044


876
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:25,038
What's is all this?

877
01:10:26,032 --> 01:10:28,031
Why do you have all this?

878
01:10:35,183 --> 01:10:37,035
You're going to assasinate him.

879
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:42,623
You're going to assasinate the Minister tonight,
aren't you?

880
01:10:47,407 --> 01:10:50,044
You know, somebody got to say it out loud.

881
01:10:50,351 --> 01:10:52,037
What in the fool happened tonight?

882
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:55,031
Nobody's gonna believe it.
No.

883
01:10:56,035 --> 01:10:59,025
I wish I could be, like, bullshit.

884
01:10:59,028 --> 01:11:03,052
Now, where can my waffle and... pussy...

885
01:11:05,026 --> 01:11:09,019
He had a one track mind. That boy had lost his head.

886
01:11:09,023 --> 01:11:10,045
Shit.

887
01:11:12,023 --> 01:11:14,022
I hope he's okay tonight.

888
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:16,042
Yeah.

889
01:11:21,504 --> 01:11:23,044
Hold on, guys. Look.

890
01:11:25,684 --> 01:11:27,051
Those are government trucks.

891
01:11:27,782 --> 01:11:30,044
I saw them on Youtube from last year's purge.

892
01:11:31,025 --> 01:11:33,038
They're going straight back to the safe zone.

893
01:11:34,349 --> 01:11:36,801
You cannot do this.
I want to win fair and fucking straight.

894
01:11:36,801 --> 01:11:41,032
They're not playing fair and fucking straight
and neither should we.

895
01:11:41,036 --> 01:11:43,045
His church will be locked up like Fort Knox.

896
01:11:43,349 --> 01:11:46,022
You'll never get through. You'll be slaughtered.

897
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:48,036
Fourth Church will be on that side.

898
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:51,046
The original bio by George Washington,
more than 200 years ago.

899
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:56,034
The man likes to have escape tunnels attached
to all his churches. They're all over DC.

900
01:11:56,034 --> 01:12:00,030
The tunnel of the original church
have been closed up since the 50s.

901
01:12:00,038 --> 01:12:01,208
But we re-open it.

902
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:05,728
We'll gonna walk right through there and
into the church without anybody even knowing.

903
01:12:06,002 --> 01:12:10,031
The original founding fathers are about
to fuck over the new founding fathers.

904
01:12:10,032 --> 01:12:12,045
Now, how do you like that for irony?

905
01:12:13,366 --> 01:12:16,022
How do you know where this mass is gonna be?

906
01:12:16,026 --> 01:12:18,032
Because we do whatever it takes.

907
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:20,035
We did this for you, Senator.
No, it's not for me.

908
01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:22,042
Get your boss on the phone. I need to talk to him.
He is not here.

909
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:25,044
Angel, listen to me. You call him!

910
01:12:25,404 --> 01:12:30,034
You tell him.
He does this and the Minister becomes a martyr.

911
01:12:30,037 --> 01:12:33,034
I cannot have my presidency built on murder.

912
01:12:33,034 --> 01:12:36,031
Do you see that?
You can't just leave it to the voters.

913
01:12:36,031 --> 01:12:38,421
He does not believe in the American system.
Angel, believe in me.

914
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:40,048
We do. That's why we are trying to pave a way

915
01:12:40,048 --> 01:12:43,025
for you to the White House. So you can make changes.

916
01:12:43,029 --> 01:12:44,031
You're going to get people killed!
You are right!

917
01:12:44,036 --> 01:12:47,026
It's Laney. She said there's trucks approaching us.

918
01:12:47,026 --> 01:12:48,052
What?

919
01:12:49,046 --> 01:12:51,036
Who is that?

920
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:54,036
Government soldiers.

921
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:58,023
It's the NFFA eliminating all the enemies for sure.

922
01:12:58,027 --> 01:13:01,024
They're after Bishop but they will kill you.

923
01:13:01,024 --> 01:13:03,030
We need to evacuate your people.
I can't leave the engine.

924
01:13:03,031 --> 01:13:06,040
I need to get her out of here now.
There is a way out in the back.

925
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:09,038
Where does it come out?
Out all the way to 3rd and Thomson.

926
01:13:09,038 --> 01:13:11,041
3rd and Thomson. Give me the phone.

927
01:13:11,045 --> 01:13:16,044
Laney, I'll meet you at 3rd and Thompson, now!
Yeah, we'll meet you there.

928
01:13:21,453 --> 01:13:24,052
So, we're driving all the way back to the war zone?

929
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:27,032
Stupid!

930
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:30,036


931
01:13:40,341 --> 01:13:43,031
Oh, these people.
We will protect them.

932
01:13:43,035 --> 01:13:47,025
Please, stop the assasination.
It's too late. Now go!

933
01:13:47,025 --> 01:13:49,028
Go
Stay safe.

934
01:13:51,032 --> 01:13:54,031
So what we supposed to be like?
Some sort of superhero or something?

935
01:13:54,032 --> 01:13:55,042
It ain't what I do.

936
01:13:55,446 --> 01:13:58,726
Super hero? I hate this night!

937
01:14:01,027 --> 01:14:02,039
Oh, shit!

938
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,033
Hell's waiting. Come on.

939
01:14:05,037 --> 01:14:07,039
Let's do it. Let's go get them.

940
01:14:10,034 --> 01:14:13,033
I can't believe we're outside again.

941
01:14:13,034 --> 01:14:16,031
We'll get you through this.

942
01:14:20,028 --> 01:14:22,048


943
01:14:23,045 --> 01:14:25,048


944
01:14:25,052 --> 01:14:28,029
Oh, god! Got it so close!

945
01:14:28,029 --> 01:14:30,026
Damn!

946
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:32,046
Are you fucking kidding me?

947
01:14:32,046 --> 01:14:33,049


948
01:14:33,053 --> 01:14:35,036
Ready?
Yeah.

949
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:38,043
One, two...

950
01:14:38,044 --> 01:14:39,049
Go!

951
01:14:42,041 --> 01:14:44,037
Good luck out there.

952
01:14:47,324 --> 01:14:51,020
# Let me hear your whisper.

953
01:14:51,025 --> 01:14:57,031
# That you love me too

954
01:14:57,032 --> 01:15:01,045


955
01:15:01,453 --> 01:15:05,046
Let's go! Let's go! Come on, I've got you.

956
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:09,450
You guys okay?
Yeah.

957
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:11,026
Thank you.

958
01:15:11,027 --> 01:15:12,036
Again.

959
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,037
Where are we? headed
Drive.

960
01:15:14,037 --> 01:15:17,024
Out of this city. Get us out of here.

961
01:15:28,039 --> 01:15:30,032
You're okay, senator?

962
01:15:30,345 --> 01:15:34,029
No, Marcos. I'm not.

963
01:15:34,036 --> 01:15:37,026
It's a nightmare for everyone.

964
01:15:43,407 --> 01:15:45,040
Senator.
I can't win like this.

965
01:15:45,304 --> 01:15:47,050
It goes against everything I believe in.

966
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:51,027
We need to focus on one thing right now,
and that's survival.

967
01:15:51,331 --> 01:15:53,050
I need to make sure you get through this tonight.

968
01:15:54,034 --> 01:15:56,707
I have to stop them from killing a minister?

969
01:15:57,107 --> 01:15:57,548
What?

970
01:15:57,548 --> 01:16:00,042
If they assasinate Edwidge, he becomes a martyr.

971
01:16:00,345 --> 01:16:02,042
We lose.

972
01:16:03,032 --> 01:16:05,738
Yeah, and how do we do that?

973
01:16:05,738 --> 01:16:07,038
I don't know. We have to do something.

974
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,045
Do what?

975
01:16:08,049 --> 01:16:12,043
Do what?
You want to risk your life saving the guy's hide...

976
01:16:12,046 --> 01:16:15,030


977
01:16:23,047 --> 01:16:27,031


978
01:16:36,702 --> 01:16:38,049
Everybody alright?

979
01:16:39,332 --> 01:16:41,035
Leo, you okay?

980
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:42,042
He's okay.

981
01:16:42,043 --> 01:16:43,036


982
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:45,029
Damn!

983
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:46,042
Oh, my God!

984
01:16:52,034 --> 01:16:54,040


985
01:16:54,044 --> 01:16:58,040


986
01:17:08,452 --> 01:17:10,045
I know where they're taking her.

987
01:17:10,409 --> 01:17:12,042
I know why she's still alive.

988
01:17:12,402 --> 01:17:13,039
Where?

989
01:17:13,412 --> 01:17:16,048
You find a safe place to hide. You stay there.

990
01:17:17,036 --> 01:17:19,035
No. No way.

991
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,037
Whatever it is you plan on doing, we're coming with you.

992
01:17:25,034 --> 01:17:27,050
Let's go.

993
01:17:40,052 --> 01:17:43,021
No!

994
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:52,026
Help! Help!

995
01:17:52,403 --> 01:17:55,036
Let me go!

996
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:48,041
No! No!

997
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:05,043


998
01:19:24,035 --> 01:19:26,041
Come on, guys. It is enough.

999
01:19:26,046 --> 01:19:30,042
Get paid to deliver the package. Not gift wrap.

1000
01:19:30,043 --> 01:19:34,036
Come on. Let's go find a place to
wait out the rest of this fucking night.

1001
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:32,045


1002
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,042
Please!

1003
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:41,040
As we always do.

1004
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,020
Blessed be the new founding fathers.

1005
01:20:45,124 --> 01:20:48,803
Let us purge and cleanse our souls.

1006
01:20:48,803 --> 01:20:51,026
Blessed be America.

1007
01:20:51,031 --> 01:20:54,044
A nation reborn.

1008
01:20:57,651 --> 01:20:59,352
It's been a long journey...

1009
01:20:59,352 --> 01:21:03,725
...to get away from the lies and self-deception.

1010
01:21:04,005 --> 01:21:10,022
To this place of knowledge and
awareness of who we really are.

1011
01:21:10,206 --> 01:21:14,039
People flesh immensely deformed.

1012
01:21:14,043 --> 01:21:20,037
Oh, it's hard to see the ugly truth,
but change can only come from acceptance

1013
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:25,450
And change we must as it is our
godly duty to get rid of the fury

1014
01:21:25,451 --> 01:21:29,041
and the hatred that poisons our souls, makes us sick!

1015
01:21:29,345 --> 01:21:31,825
Make us ugly!

1016
01:21:33,032 --> 01:21:38,045
Tonight, we the leaders of this great country

1017
01:21:38,046 --> 01:21:43,401
will sin, scour, sanitize and sterilize our souls

1018
01:21:43,401 --> 01:21:49,049
until we are free again,
and this country will be better purged.

1019
01:21:50,033 --> 01:21:54,743
We are not hypocrites!

1020
01:21:55,404 --> 01:21:58,431
We practice what we preach.

1021
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:02,631
Purge and purify, say it with me.

1022
01:22:03,405 --> 01:22:11,034
Purge and purify. Purge and purify. Purge and purify.

1023
01:22:14,406 --> 01:22:16,732
Let's us begin.

1024
01:22:17,036 --> 01:22:19,023
Now, look. It's after midnight.

1025
01:22:19,023 --> 01:22:23,026
We need a pool. I need a 4-men team in there.
I need three with me. Got it?

1026
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:26,026
Go!
Bishop!

1027
01:22:27,027 --> 01:22:28,047
Bishop!

1028
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:36,735
Bishop!

1029
01:22:41,025 --> 01:22:42,631
Bishop!

1030
01:22:46,339 --> 01:22:47,648
I'm unarmed.

1031
01:22:48,423 --> 01:22:50,729
How well do you know this Dante?

1032
01:22:51,029 --> 01:22:53,732
Not well. So, keep your eye on Leo.

1033
01:22:54,036 --> 01:22:57,033
Our boy's gonna get himself killed.

1034
01:22:57,033 --> 01:22:59,043
I'm unarmed.

1035
01:23:00,024 --> 01:23:02,047
You know this lunatic, Dante?

1036
01:23:03,034 --> 01:23:06,031
Yeah, I do.

1037
01:23:06,341 --> 01:23:07,647
Guns down!

1038
01:23:10,025 --> 01:23:11,741
What the hell are you doing here?

1039
01:23:12,402 --> 01:23:14,721
Trying to get yourself killed?

1040
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,745
That's the tunnel to the cathedral?

1041
01:23:19,422 --> 01:23:21,751
How the fuck do you know about the tunnel?

1042
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:27,633
I asked you a question.

1043
01:23:33,254 --> 01:23:35,527
This is no longer assasination.

1044
01:23:36,027 --> 01:23:37,743
It's a rescue mission.

1045
01:23:38,354 --> 01:23:42,641
Jesus died for their sins!

1046
01:23:44,025 --> 01:23:45,522
Do not try you dare touch me!

1047
01:23:46,025 --> 01:23:50,038
And now our modern day martyrs,
would die for our pleasure.

1048
01:23:50,042 --> 01:23:52,429
Do not disturb him!

1049
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:57,846
Our martyr's name is Lawrence.

1050
01:23:58,625 --> 01:24:00,643
A life-long drug addict.

1051
01:24:01,406 --> 01:24:03,740
He wants to make amends.

1052
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,737
He wants to serve his god...

1053
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,043
...and his government.

1054
01:24:10,034 --> 01:24:11,740
Let's thank Lawrence for his gift.

1055
01:24:12,341 --> 01:24:17,028
Thank you, Lawrence! I love you!

1056
01:24:17,028 --> 01:24:20,031
Thank you very much.

1057
01:24:20,035 --> 01:24:22,044
We love Lawrence.

1058
01:24:30,036 --> 01:24:34,035
These weapons have been cleansed with holy water.

1059
01:24:34,036 --> 01:24:40,030
And now there are now instruments of destruction.

1060
01:24:40,044 --> 01:24:42,030
<i>No!

1061
01:24:42,031 --> 01:24:45,040
Fuck! No!

1062
01:24:46,421 --> 01:24:49,048
You all know the lawyer, Harmon James?

1063
01:24:49,048 --> 01:24:54,025
Working with the NFFA tirelessly for many years.

1064
01:24:54,028 --> 01:24:57,205
Harmon will be the first purger of the evening.

1065
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:07,042
Oh, God, please, do not, do not!

1066
01:25:07,046 --> 01:25:11,046
Please .. please .. please .. please ..

1067
01:25:11,047 --> 01:25:15,030
Please .. please .. please .. please, please ..

1068
01:25:15,034 --> 01:25:18,036
Do not, please! Please do not .. do not!

1069
01:25:18,037 --> 01:25:21,021
Let me go! No!

1070
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:27,021
Do not let go!
Release her, Harmon.

1071
01:25:27,035 --> 01:25:30,041
No!

1072
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:34,038
No!

1073
01:25:34,042 --> 01:25:38,029
Remove the violence from your darkened heart.

1074
01:25:38,029 --> 01:25:41,046
Purge your soul. Let the light in!

1075
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:47,037
You are baptized with the light! Gone!

1076
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:50,024
Disappear!

1077
01:25:54,028 --> 01:25:59,031
His light entered your heart, Harmon.

1078
01:25:59,035 --> 01:26:02,028
Yes!

1079
01:26:06,029 --> 01:26:10,039
The power of purging!
Purge and purify!

1080
01:26:10,043 --> 01:26:17,026
Purge and purify! Purge and purify! Purge and purify!

1081
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:22,040
Purge and purify! Purge and purify!

1082
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:32,225
Listen. No matter what happens, we stay together.

1083
01:26:35,035 --> 01:26:37,048
Okay, this will take us to the mechanical room.

1084
01:26:37,049 --> 01:26:41,022
From there we can access the cathedral.

1085
01:26:50,337 --> 01:26:51,727
Stay there. Where do we go?

1086
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:55,040
The church is above us.
So, our pretty Secret Service agent,

1087
01:26:55,044 --> 01:26:57,354
you'll gonna take the staircase to the balcony.

1088
01:26:57,354 --> 01:27:00,248
Me and my guys will enter from behind the altar,
on this side.

1089
01:27:00,408 --> 01:27:03,728
Okay, good. Let's go get our girl, yeah?

1090
01:27:08,452 --> 01:27:11,039
Before we get to our communal purge.

1091
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:14,036
A holy war for many martyrs.

1092
01:27:14,036 --> 01:27:16,742
I'd like to introduce a guest.

1093
01:27:17,343 --> 01:27:23,733
He's going to be the centerpiece of a...
very special purge ceremony tonight.

1094
01:27:25,344 --> 01:27:26,750
This person...

1095
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:31,050
...has threatened to dismantle everything

1096
01:27:31,454 --> 01:27:35,050
that we, the new founding fathers, had done.

1097
01:27:38,411 --> 01:27:42,745
We must rid ourselves...

1098
01:27:44,032 --> 01:27:46,631
...of the negative emotions.

1099
01:27:47,032 --> 01:27:51,045
But she had stood in silence.

1100
01:27:51,404 --> 01:27:56,740
We must stop her from poisoning our great country.

1101
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,746
Taking away our freedom!

1102
01:28:02,047 --> 01:28:06,037


1103
01:28:15,029 --> 01:28:17,041
Yes.

1104
01:28:17,409 --> 01:28:21,725
I would like all the founding fathers to come to the altar.

1105
01:28:22,029 --> 01:28:24,032
Join me, purgers.

1106
01:28:24,033 --> 01:28:27,129
As we eliminate evil...

1107
01:28:27,829 --> 01:28:29,849
...and purge as one.

1108
01:28:30,053 --> 01:28:36,037


1109
01:28:36,041 --> 01:28:41,031


1110
01:29:05,417 --> 01:29:09,034


1111
01:29:09,037 --> 01:29:14,040
We ask You to receive this child into your loving arms.

1112
01:29:19,408 --> 01:29:23,744
We are sinners. Let us release.

1113
01:29:25,036 --> 01:29:31,045
Caleb, our leader. I invite you, sir,
to lead us in this purge.

1114
01:29:31,046 --> 01:29:36,026
As you have and as you will.

1115
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:41,050


1116
01:29:42,047 --> 01:29:46,031
Blessed be our new founding fathers.

1117
01:29:46,031 --> 01:29:49,047
Let us purge.

1118
01:30:00,032 --> 01:30:01,038
No!

1119
01:30:01,406 --> 01:30:06,049
And blessed be America, a nation reborn.

1120
01:30:06,513 --> 01:30:07,526
Rifle!

1121
01:30:20,454 --> 01:30:21,743
Run!

1122
01:31:05,442 --> 01:31:07,722
She's alive!

1123
01:31:11,409 --> 01:31:12,649
Get down!

1124
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:39,825
Briole?

1125
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:48,026
What are you all doing up there?

1126
01:31:50,023 --> 01:31:52,036
Bring your ass down here.

1127
01:31:56,031 --> 01:31:57,527
My negro.

1128
01:31:58,041 --> 01:32:00,031
Let's go!

1129
01:32:11,045 --> 01:32:13,048


1130
01:32:25,443 --> 01:32:27,046
Are you okay?
Yeah.

1131
01:32:29,037 --> 01:32:32,043
Thank you... again.

1132
01:32:34,024 --> 01:32:36,030
What was that?
My men taking care of business.

1133
01:32:36,035 --> 01:32:38,025
Go, go!

1134
01:32:38,038 --> 01:32:42,032
We're headed out. Back there.
You have him?

1135
01:32:42,405 --> 01:32:43,448
<i>We have him.

1136
01:32:48,409 --> 01:32:49,726
Move!

1137
01:32:50,406 --> 01:32:51,049
Hey!

1138
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:54,023
Listen to me!
You listen to me!

1139
01:32:54,030 --> 01:32:56,023
Look, you're not supposed to, please!
About what?

1140
01:32:56,027 --> 01:32:57,046
Josh, hold a minute!
Move!

1141
01:32:58,023 --> 01:32:59,026
And listen to me!
I thought I'd wait it out.

1142
01:32:59,030 --> 01:33:01,043
I can win without it! Please!
I will be back!

1143
01:33:01,044 --> 01:33:04,024
You will win. I'm gonna make sure that happens.

1144
01:33:04,027 --> 01:33:06,026
Open up!
Stop.

1145
01:33:06,028 --> 01:33:10,041
This is a murder.
If you do this, you will not be different than them.

1146
01:33:11,031 --> 01:33:14,041
Get her.
Move! Move!

1147
01:33:14,408 --> 01:33:16,025
Listen to her!

1148
01:33:16,025 --> 01:33:19,048
She knows what she's doing.
We don't need to do this.

1149
01:33:20,032 --> 01:33:22,026
Hang on, Dante.

1150
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:24,045
You get out of my way!

1151
01:33:24,049 --> 01:33:27,043
Uh, please! Oh, God!

1152
01:33:34,404 --> 01:33:36,047
Don't do this!

1153
01:33:36,454 --> 01:33:41,024
If you do this, you will be no different from them.

1154
01:33:42,038 --> 01:33:46,037
We need to can't be like them.

1155
01:33:49,409 --> 01:33:52,022
Look at me.

1156
01:34:03,047 --> 01:34:06,250
Purge, my son.

1157
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:09,050
Purge...

1158
01:34:10,024 --> 01:34:13,047
It's your right as American.

1159
01:34:14,044 --> 01:34:19,028
Kill me. Kill me.

1160
01:34:19,035 --> 01:34:22,022
Your son is gone.

1161
01:34:22,052 --> 01:34:25,049
God won't...
Shut up the fuck up!

1162
01:34:27,042 --> 01:34:29,048
Coward.

1163
01:34:30,033 --> 01:34:32,029
Purge!

1164
01:34:32,033 --> 01:34:38,027
Do it, do it! Yes! Yes! Kill me!

1165
01:34:39,037 --> 01:34:42,039
Let me tell you right now. I like black people.

1166
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:46,031
But, I will not let you all shoot these white folks.

1167
01:34:46,038 --> 01:34:50,024
These are our white people, okay?

1168
01:34:50,031 --> 01:34:53,048
So, let's put them down.

1169
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:06,046
You better fucking win.

1170
01:35:12,404 --> 01:35:14,043
Go! Go!

1171
01:35:15,027 --> 01:35:16,043
Move!

1172
01:35:37,029 --> 01:35:38,049
Oh, my God!

1173
01:35:41,413 --> 01:35:44,046
You murderous pig!

1174
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:48,053
I am going to beat the shit out of you on election day.

1175
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:58,031
I'm not as thrilled to be correct as the senator.

1176
01:36:05,412 --> 01:36:07,051
Goodnight, blue jeans.

1177
01:36:10,236 --> 01:36:12,029
Well played, Leo.

1178
01:36:12,033 --> 01:36:13,730
Thanks, Joe.

1179
01:36:15,403 --> 01:36:17,177
Get going, man! Fucking pig!

1180
01:36:17,417 --> 01:36:20,030
I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna hurt you.

1181
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,043
I'll get you out of here!

1182
01:36:21,404 --> 01:36:23,040
Stay here! We'll find a vehicle.

1183
01:36:23,404 --> 01:36:25,230
What about these people?

1184
01:36:36,329 --> 01:36:38,031
Back, back, back! Get back!

1185
01:36:38,355 --> 01:36:40,048
You got this.
You know I got this.

1186
01:36:45,422 --> 01:36:48,026
How bad is it?
Not good.

1187
01:36:50,443 --> 01:36:53,053
I've got one more move in me. Cover me!
Go!

1188
01:37:29,037 --> 01:37:31,031


1189
01:37:31,431 --> 01:37:35,040
Shit! Keep him quiet!
Shut him up before he draws all kind of attention.

1190
01:37:37,421 --> 01:37:39,048
Shut up! Shut up!

1191
01:38:13,545 --> 01:38:16,044
You motherfucker!

1192
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:36,023
Get up!

1193
01:39:16,025 --> 01:39:18,027
Motherfucker.

1194
01:39:22,408 --> 01:39:25,034
You know, this is great! You're safe!
Get me out of here!

1195
01:39:25,435 --> 01:39:27,041
Let me out! Okay! Let me out!

1196
01:39:28,386 --> 01:39:29,038
Stop him!

1197
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:22,043
Hang on, Joe.

1198
01:40:22,344 --> 01:40:25,035
Come on! Don't! Let me help!

1199
01:40:25,368 --> 01:40:28,051
Don't. Okay. We gotta get you somewhere.
Okay, you're gonna be okay.

1200
01:40:29,752 --> 01:40:32,028
Well, there's no way to take me.

1201
01:40:32,412 --> 01:40:35,036
You'll gonna be fine. That's what important.

1202
01:40:37,413 --> 01:40:41,026
She's gonna make sure, right, senator?

1203
01:40:41,036 --> 01:40:43,030
Yeah.

1204
01:40:52,027 --> 01:40:53,830
You got this.

1205
01:40:56,405 --> 01:40:57,631
I got this.

1206
01:41:00,035 --> 01:41:03,041
Uh, Marcos.

1207
01:41:12,029 --> 01:41:15,023
Uncle Joe, Joe, Joe.

1208
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:17,049
Joe, it's me.

1209
01:41:18,027 --> 01:41:19,036
No!

1210
01:41:20,030 --> 01:41:22,033
Wake up, Joe!

1211
01:41:22,034 --> 01:41:24,050
Wake up! Joe!

1212
01:41:37,025 --> 01:41:43,038


1213
01:41:54,454 --> 01:41:57,023
<i>That was Senator Roan this morning

1214
01:41:57,024 --> 01:41:59,023
<i>casting the first vote of the day.

1215
01:41:59,027 --> 01:42:03,030
<i>It's been a great day for the senator so far
having already won New York, California,

1216
01:42:03,035 --> 01:42:06,651
<i>and... wait, hold on, I am getting word right now.

1217
01:42:07,032 --> 01:42:09,038
<i>That the senator has also taken Florida

1218
01:42:09,045 --> 01:42:14,025
<i>which puts her well over the
270 electoral votes for the win.

1219
01:42:14,029 --> 01:42:19,250
<i>So, that is it. It is now official. The next president
of the United States will be Charlie Roan.

1220
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:23,043
<i>And president-elect Roan already
stated that her first order of business

1221
01:42:23,043 --> 01:42:27,233
<i>will be taking executive action
to put an end to the Purge.

1222
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:28,034
Updates?

1223
01:42:29,351 --> 01:42:31,044
With a landslide.

1224
01:42:38,405 --> 01:42:41,652
Alright, I'll come by tomorrow.
We can get started on the ceiling.

1225
01:42:41,652 --> 01:42:42,742
Sounds good.

1226
01:42:54,033 --> 01:42:57,026
The place is really coming along, Marcos.

1227
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,040
Joe will be really happy.

1228
01:43:03,804 --> 01:43:05,637
I'll catch you later, kid.

1229
01:43:23,337 --> 01:43:27,245
<i>We're just now hearing reports about a
few scattered incidents around the country

1230
01:43:27,246 --> 01:43:31,829
<i>where NFFA supporters are
reacting violently to this defeat.

1231
01:43:31,829 --> 01:43:37,720
<i>They are burning cars, breaking windows, riot,
attacking police officers...
