1
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:20,172
-I'm Shawn Ruddy, and
I'm a piece of trash.

2
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:25,482
I'm Shawn Ruddy, the
world's biggest wuss.

3
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:27,965
And because I love
attention and hate myself,

4
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:32,931
I'm facing all of my fears one
dumb ass challenge at a time.

5
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:36,241
Help!

6
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:38,241
Ah!

7
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:43,620
Stop! Muchachos!

8
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:48,206
Hey, douchebags!

9
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:51,068
What did you say?

10
00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:53,000
- Oh
- Hey!

11
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,551
This is "The Wrath of Shawn."

12
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:01,724
Welcome to "The Wrath of
Shawn." Happy Halloween!

13
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:04,620
Ah!

14
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:08,724
No, no, no!

15
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,344
Help!

16
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:17,827
Ah!

17
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:19,793
Hadouken!

18
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:27,137
I'm back!

19
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,689
After six months of
eating ramen noodles

20
00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:35,000
with chopped up bits of Vienna
sausages, I am monetized again.

21
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,517
But I don't care
about that stuff.

22
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,448
I don't care about money.

23
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:42,379
I care about you.

24
00:01:42,482 --> 00:01:44,620
For seven years now,
you have watched me face

25
00:01:44,724 --> 00:01:46,413
my fears for your entertainment.

26
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:49,724
And I'm happy to announce
I've faced them all.

27
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:51,103
Not.

28
00:01:51,206 --> 00:01:53,241
There is one fear that
I haven't yet faced.

29
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:56,344
Something I fear more than
cops. More than sharks.

30
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:58,551
More than playing
bingo with the elderly.

31
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:02,689
I, Shawn Ruddy, and
mortally terrified of...

32
00:02:02,793 --> 00:02:04,034
ghosts.

33
00:02:05,896 --> 00:02:07,551
-I was raised in
a religious home.

34
00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:10,758
I believe in that stuff.
I hate that stuff.

35
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:12,068
I haven't seen a horror movie

36
00:02:12,172 --> 00:02:13,620
since the first
half of "Ghost Dad."

37
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:16,758
And that's why I hate myself
for what I'm about to say.

38
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:18,551
For my next livestream event,

39
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:24,172
I will be spending one night
alone in a haunted house.

40
00:02:26,206 --> 00:02:27,758
If there are ghosts
in the house,

41
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:30,310
it's pretty much a guarantee
that I'm going to piss them off.

42
00:02:30,413 --> 00:02:32,551
That's why my mom packed
me this paranormal kit.

43
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:37,068
Holy water, a crucifix, salt,
garlic, and a silver dagger.

44
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:39,724
I have come up with one rule
that you and the sponsors

45
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:44,517
can hold me to... if I see
or hear anything unusual,

46
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,034
I have to check it out.

47
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:49,758
If you let me break this
rule, I will not get paid.

48
00:02:49,862 --> 00:02:52,000
I
will not get paid.

49
00:02:52,103 --> 00:02:53,562
This is
on you now, Internet.

50
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:56,034
Tune into my Livvid
channel on October 20th,

51
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:57,827
11:00 p.m. Mountain
Standard Time

52
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:01,862
for the biggest comeback
event since the first Easter.

53
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:03,275
I'll see you then.

54
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,172
Don't forget to smash
that like button,

55
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:08,137
smash that subscribe button,
and follow me on Livvid.

56
00:03:35,034 --> 00:03:36,620
Welcome to "The wrath of Shawn."

57
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:40,482
These shirts are available
right now in my merch store,

58
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:42,172
and as always,

59
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:45,724
I've composed a score
specifically for this broadcast.

60
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:49,482
I'm calling this one "Shawn
Carpenter's Halloween."

61
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:52,068
Available now on iTunes.

62
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:56,206
Okay, this is Shawn Ruddy,

63
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,758
coming to you live from...

64
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:02,137
Death Manor.

65
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,517
I'm doing a dramatic push
in, if you can't tell.

66
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,793
This is the most haunted
house in the United States.

67
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:10,413
And by that, I mean
the most haunted

68
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,655
but not too famous for
me to film in house.

69
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:16,827
And I'm spending
the night there.

70
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:18,896
I've had the nervous
poops all week.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,931
But no matter what
happens to me,

72
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:23,000
I am committed to bringing you

73
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:26,206
the most cinematic
experience in live streaming.

74
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,413
I've got my Livvid
bracelet right here.

75
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:31,827
So when I flick my wrist,
this will cut back and forth

76
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:34,965
from my selfie
camera, my P.O.V. cam.

77
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:37,448
Okay.

78
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:47,517
Now, this next part is called
protecting me from myself.

79
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:55,206
I need to remove any
temptation of an easy exit.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,068
I know me way too well.

81
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,275
I've done a lot of
stupid things before,

82
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:10,551
but I've never been completely
alone while doing that.

83
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:24,000
If you're just tuning in,

84
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:27,758
I am about to make my
approach to Death Manor.

85
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:38,551
Death Manor was built in 1880
by a wealthy Mormon pioneer

86
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:43,827
for his social outcast daughter,
a poet named Mildred Pratt.

87
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:45,827
Mildred would later
commit suicide

88
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:49,103
and become the first of
many deaths in this house.

89
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:51,310
Did her suicide curse the house?

90
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:55,206
Or was Mildred the victim
of an already cursed house?

91
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,862
That's not a good sign.

92
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,965
This is not going well for me.

93
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:05,241
I'm not a big fan
of these woods.

94
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:09,137
They actually found a body
out here a few years ago.

95
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:12,517
The face was completely
eaten by rats.

96
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,689
Was it related to the
power of this house?

97
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,103
Maybe.

98
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:20,482
Maybe it was also...

99
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:21,793
A stick man.

100
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:25,448
That is some
satanic Wiccan crap.

101
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:29,034
I got to get some eyes out here.

102
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:42,000
All of these infrared
cameras are motion activated

103
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:44,172
and will cut right into
the feed automatically.

104
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:48,241
So if anything happens
out here, we'll know.

105
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,517
Let's see.

106
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:05,862
Not a big fan of barbed
wire or "bobbed" wire,

107
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:07,448
as my mom calls it.

108
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:09,793
There's got to be another door.

109
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:22,206
Yeah. This is better.

110
00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:30,448
Good thing I've been lifting.

111
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:37,758
Being banned from the
Internet has given me

112
00:07:37,862 --> 00:07:39,310
time to work on my self.

113
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:41,655
Ah!

114
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:51,655
Okay.

115
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,551
Spiders!

116
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:04,310
Ah!

117
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:29,172
Okay. Before I
change my mind...

118
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:40,034
This is also called
protecting me from myself.

119
00:08:40,137 --> 00:08:42,103
What is that, a vent?

120
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:51,448
After Mildred's death, 11
more people died in this house

121
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:54,827
before it was finally
boarded up in 1956.

122
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:56,689
That's... Shit! Shoot!

123
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:59,896
I meant shoot. Please
don't monetize me, Livvid.

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,827
This is an intense situation.

125
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:03,491
I think there should
be a strike system,

126
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:07,689
like three strikes or something,
starting on the next one.

127
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,310
Holy F.

128
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:16,275
This room smells like my A.H.

129
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:17,931
"Help me."

130
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:21,034
It's just paint.
It's just paint.

131
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:24,482
Is anyone else
creeped out by this?

132
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:27,931
"I'm an atheist. I don't
believe in ghosts."

133
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,068
Oh, good for you, Kimbucha.

134
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:32,896
"Haunted houses are overdone."

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,620
How can haunted
houses be overdone?

136
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:37,137
I've never done one before.

137
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:40,344
Kiguy5... "Did kids call you
crater face in high school?"

138
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:44,000
No, because in high
school it was still acne.

139
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:47,655
Your nuts. Yeah. What
about him?

140
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:52,517
What is that?

141
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,517
Oh, gross! Oh, gross!

142
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,965
That's disgusting.

143
00:09:57,068 --> 00:09:58,965
Alright, Shawn, 10 minutes in,

144
00:09:59,068 --> 00:10:02,206
you've already got
swearing and drugs.

145
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,310
Is that a well bucket?

146
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,620
I feel like I'm in "The Ring."

147
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:28,896
Here it is.

148
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,551
Mildred's old kitchen.

149
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:37,793
That means that's the room.

150
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,413
Okay.

151
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:45,379
Judas Priest! Look
at that thing.

152
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:47,793
Looks like it could
fillet someone.

153
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:50,103
Okay.

154
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:52,448
Tonight, we're going to
be monitoring three rooms,

155
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,517
all of which have actual
documented paranormal activity.

156
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,413
The first room,
the master bedroom.

157
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:05,413
Ahh.

158
00:11:05,517 --> 00:11:08,275
We got to get a camera
up in here, too.

159
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:13,724
Internet, say a prayer
this chair doesn't break.

160
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,448
Is that gonna hold?

161
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:25,758
Pro tip... Always
carry duct tape.

162
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:30,068
You can literally fix 90% of
life's problems with duct tape.

163
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:32,620
I made a wallet of duct
tape in eighth grade.

164
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:34,517
I'm still proud of it.

165
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:38,241
Master.

166
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:44,827
Okay, this room has two separate
reports of the same ghost

167
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:47,103
who I like to call Corner Man.

168
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,517
This is the first account.

169
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,482
In 1910, a man named Max Loland
wrote about a reoccurring dream

170
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:56,965
he had while sleeping
in this room.

171
00:11:57,068 --> 00:12:00,103
"In my dreams, I wake up
and see a very tall man

172
00:12:00,206 --> 00:12:02,034
in the north corner of my room.

173
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:05,103
I can't see his face, but
I know he's watching me.

174
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:07,586
And he always whispers
the same thing...

175
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:10,344
The pond water still.

176
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:16,000
One year later, Max
Loland died in his sleep.

177
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,896
In this room.

178
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,034
Probably in this nasty bed.

179
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:24,413
North corner.

180
00:12:24,517 --> 00:12:28,551
Okay, prepare yourself.
This is really disturbing.

181
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:32,551
"In 1995, a team of
paranormal investigators

182
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:37,344
came into this room
and took this picture.

183
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:40,586
They were standing right here.

184
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:55,206
I don't think I can
be in here anymore.

185
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:02,034
I hope you all appreciate
the public service

186
00:13:02,137 --> 00:13:03,551
I'm doing by being here.

187
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,448
LilyKing98... "Shawn,
please do the right thing

188
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:09,551
and help the spirits of
this house find rest."

189
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:13,965
Hell, no! I'm not an
exorcist, LilyKing98.

190
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:16,793
Oyaboyo... "Are you still
with what's her name?"

191
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,793
No, shh! We're here.

192
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,724
That's where it happened.

193
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:27,379
Mildred hung herself right
at the top of these stairs.

194
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:38,827
From all accounts
I could dig up,

195
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:42,517
Mildred's small town community
wasn't a big fan of, quote,

196
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,413
"odd duck Mildred
and her weird poems."

197
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:47,103
So her dad built
her this big house.

198
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:48,344
I don't know why.

199
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:49,872
My guess is he thought
it might attract

200
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,068
a husband for her.

201
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:58,758
But no one wanted her it seems.

202
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:01,862
As creepy as the
Corner Man stuff is,

203
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:04,103
it's the second
floor that's the real

204
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:07,034
paranormal G-spot in this house.

205
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:10,758
Okay.

206
00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:18,517
The nursery.

207
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,931
From what I found in my
research, five children

208
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:22,172
have died in this room.

209
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:27,034
Two babies and three kids.

210
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:34,172
Oh. I've always hated
creepy kid movies.

211
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:36,862
What if Haley Joel Osment
was just sitting here?

212
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:38,862
As an adult.

213
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:41,068
Oh, that's worse.

214
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,620
Look at that window.

215
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:46,034
Why isn't this one boarded up?

216
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,758
You think something escaped?

217
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:59,482
Okay, now, for the ghost
evidence of this room.

218
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:02,413
I'm going to play this messed
up video from some ghost hunters

219
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:05,517
in the '90s while I
set up the room cam.

220
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:11,310
-I don't want to go
back in there, Dad.

221
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:14,172
-Just a little longer,
just to help us out.

222
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:15,379
-No.

223
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:18,206
-Well, we can get
ice cream after.

224
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,344
Jessica!

225
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:22,172
They told me it's not my room.

226
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:24,689
-Who told you that?

227
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,137
Pretty creepy, right?

228
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:35,275
That girl totally saw
something in this room.

229
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:38,275
Also, I just want to
say, I do not condone

230
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:41,344
the use of a child in
paranormal research.

231
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:45,103
I've never used children
before in my stunts.

232
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:47,275
Despite what people say,
there are further depths

233
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,586
that I could sink to.

234
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:52,413
Okay. Last room.

235
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:55,482
This is the room I've
been dreading the most.

236
00:15:58,103 --> 00:16:01,275
The bathroom.

237
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:04,448
A mirror!

238
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:06,551
Bloody Mary.

239
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:10,206
The last death that
I could find happened

240
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,724
in this bathtub in 1955.

241
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:18,448
Ohhhh.

242
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:19,965
Ah!

243
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:21,655
I would never.

244
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:28,344
I'm about to play an EVP
recorded in this room in 2002.

245
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:31,241
For those of you
unfamiliar with EVPs,

246
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:35,379
EVP stands for Electronic
Voice Phenomenon.

247
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:37,482
The idea is that
recordings may be able to

248
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:39,310
pick up communications
from the dead

249
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:40,965
that we otherwise can't hear.

250
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:43,137
I'll show you. Listen to this.

251
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:46,793
-We've got Jay. He's
going to man the recorder.

252
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:49,275
He's been feeling really sick.

253
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:52,551
-Yeah, I just... I don't.
I don't like it here.

254
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:56,310
The second we walked in,
I just... I don't like it.

255
00:16:57,724 --> 00:17:00,724
Yeah, I just... I don't
know. I don't like it here.

256
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:05,103
The second we walked in,
I just... I don't like it.

257
00:17:05,206 --> 00:17:06,793
I don't like it.

258
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:10,655
I don't like it.
I don't like it.

259
00:17:10,758 --> 00:17:11,931
-Did you guys hear that?

260
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:14,827
The ghost said "mama"
and "pond water."

261
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:16,620
It's just like
that guy's journal.

262
00:17:16,724 --> 00:17:19,517
Corner Ghost said the
pond water is still.

263
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:24,275
It was totally pond water!

264
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:27,310
Okay, fine. Maybe it
was "bond mother."

265
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,000
Either way, there's a
presence still in this bath.

266
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:32,413
Why is it still here?

267
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:36,517
Well, that brings us back
to our story of pathetic,

268
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,379
lonely Mildred
and her sad poems.

269
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:42,103
Mildred lived here for
eight years in this house,

270
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:44,482
writing poems about
the romantic love

271
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:45,965
she didn't have.

272
00:17:46,068 --> 00:17:49,172
A tortured artist,
you could say.

273
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:54,068
But she was finally hit
with a stroke of luck

274
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:56,068
when a handsome,
wealthy publisher

275
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:58,206
from the East Coast
named Lars Jorgensen

276
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,448
passed through her small town.

277
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:06,517
They fell in love,
and for two years,

278
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,931
they wrote each other love
letters almost every day.

279
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:12,379
Want to know what happens next?

280
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,551
You're going to
have to stay tuned.

281
00:18:21,206 --> 00:18:23,137
All right. For
whatever reason,

282
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:27,724
this room hasn't had any
reports of paranormal activity.

283
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:34,172
Which is why I'm calling
this the safe room

284
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:37,206
and setting up my home base.

285
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,655
This room is now "Wrath
of Shawn" headquarters.

286
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:47,172
A closet!

287
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:49,620
Oh, no. Ghosts love closets.

288
00:18:49,724 --> 00:18:52,103
I have to check.

289
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:00,206
Okay. We're clear.

290
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,965
What is that?

291
00:19:02,068 --> 00:19:04,137
What is this?!

292
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:05,310
I do not like this!

293
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:07,068
If something happens
to me tonight,

294
00:19:07,172 --> 00:19:10,379
I guarantee it'll be
because of this thing.

295
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,275
Okay, let's get some proper
light in here, shall we?

296
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:15,413
I think I deserve that.

297
00:19:20,103 --> 00:19:21,965
If you're just tuning in,

298
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:27,655
I have just finished
my setup of the house.

299
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,241
Ah.

300
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:48,241
Ahh.

301
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:50,758
I better just go
halfsies on this thing.

302
00:19:50,862 --> 00:19:52,206
I'm not as young
as I used to be.

303
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,655
No offense, Thunder.

304
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:57,034
I mean, I know it says
100% natural ingredients,

305
00:19:57,137 --> 00:19:58,620
so I'm sure it's good for you.

306
00:19:58,724 --> 00:19:59,965
If you're 18.

307
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:02,068
SleeplesslnSerbia...
For the love of God,

308
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:03,551
tell us what
happened to Mildred.

309
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:07,379
No, I got to keep you
guys watching all night.

310
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:09,275
TatumTot... provoke the spirits.

311
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:13,551
I am provoking
them. By being here.

312
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:15,482
Seriously I'm out?
No, no, no, no, no.

313
00:20:15,586 --> 00:20:17,026
Wait, wait, wait,
don't go, don't go.

314
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:18,551
I'll provoke.

315
00:20:18,655 --> 00:20:21,482
And yes, I did make a wheel
of stupid things for this.

316
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:24,379
Let me get it.

317
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:28,620
Right. See? All
right, I'll spin.

318
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:31,103
Oh, seance? Come on.

319
00:20:31,206 --> 00:20:33,931
Okay, but I get to
choose the room.

320
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:36,517
We're going to do things
my way. All right?

321
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:42,655
Okay, back to the
shocking conclusion

322
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:44,310
of the Mildred saga.

323
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:46,724
After writing each other
letters for two years,

324
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:50,379
Lars asked Mildred to marry
him and move to Boston.

325
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,000
She was finally about to leave

326
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:54,724
what she called "this
stinky little town."

327
00:20:54,827 --> 00:20:57,655
But just two days before
she was supposed to move,

328
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,310
Lars unexpectedly died.

329
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:04,206
She hung herself the next
day at the end of this hall.

330
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:14,793
And legend has it that
everyone who died after her

331
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:16,724
is still in this house.

332
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:19,137
Why?

333
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:22,758
Because Mildred is collecting
souls to create the family

334
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:25,344
she could never have in life.

335
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:56,172
Oh, no way!

336
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,689
Oh, this is too perfect!

337
00:21:58,793 --> 00:22:02,034
Oh, somebody look this up and
find a year on this thing.

338
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:04,413
And the going price on eBay.

339
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:09,827
Should I be offended that
clowns wear whiteface?

340
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:12,793
I'm always out of touch with
the rules on these things.

341
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,551
Spirit from another time,

342
00:22:21,655 --> 00:22:23,896
I touch something

343
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,931
that was once thine.

344
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:29,275
Come to me. I summoned thee.

345
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:44,000
Red rover, red rover, send
dead babies right over.

346
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:48,862
Geez.

347
00:22:48,965 --> 00:22:51,044
I'm not sure how you're
supposed to tell the difference

348
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:53,310
between old house
sounds and ghost sounds.

349
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,517
Ghosts have a really...

350
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,896
Did you guys hear
that? It's... aah!

351
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,413
It's coming after me.

352
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:12,793
That was not a house
sound. That was a thump!

353
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,172
What kind of a house goes thump?

354
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:18,413
Here's the thing.

355
00:23:18,517 --> 00:23:21,758
I was too scared to say
it back there, but...

356
00:23:21,862 --> 00:23:25,620
I felt something, like...
like a vibration in my chest.

357
00:23:25,724 --> 00:23:28,034
Like... it felt like.

358
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,172
You believed me.

359
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:34,148
I'm thinking about producing
a film starring me.

360
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:35,862
You know, I actually
think I'm good enough.

361
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:38,482
I'm going to call it
"The Excor-Shawnce"

362
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:40,137
or "Shawn-corcist."

363
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:42,344
Speaking of cysts, I
used to date this girl

364
00:23:42,448 --> 00:23:44,137
that had a cyst in her forearm.

365
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:47,172
I mean, it wasn't huge, but
it still gave me the heebies.

366
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:49,896
Now my memories have
exaggerated over time.

367
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,482
So every time I think about her,

368
00:23:51,586 --> 00:23:54,344
I imagine this Popeye
arm looking girl.

369
00:23:54,448 --> 00:23:57,172
Makes me want to throw up.

370
00:23:57,275 --> 00:23:59,965
We should look her up!

371
00:24:00,068 --> 00:24:02,482
How freaky would it be
if we did an episode

372
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:04,068
where we drain her cyst?

373
00:24:04,172 --> 00:24:05,965
You gag, you lose challenge.

374
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:10,482
Can't even think about it.

375
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,448
Oh, come on. That
doesn't even look real.

376
00:24:48,551 --> 00:24:51,241
I'm not falling for
this Photoshop hack job.

377
00:24:51,344 --> 00:24:54,896
I've been using Photoshop
since eighth grade.

378
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Okay. All right, I'll play.

379
00:24:57,103 --> 00:25:00,000
Let's pull up that
part of the time code.

380
00:25:00,103 --> 00:25:02,172
Let's go there.

381
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:33,896
That was real. That was real.

382
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,344
What do we do?

383
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:40,310
I'm not going back out there.
That was right outside the door.

384
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,413
Screw the rules. That
wasn't a ghost sound.

385
00:25:44,517 --> 00:25:46,551
That was a literal,
actual thing.

386
00:25:46,655 --> 00:25:49,551
Like a demon or
Slenderman or something.

387
00:25:49,655 --> 00:25:53,344
You all saw it. It
had freaking legs!

388
00:25:53,448 --> 00:25:55,724
Damn it.

389
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:58,206
Stop. Stop. I'm not
losing my sponsors again.

390
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,724
Just... Just let me think.

391
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,275
Okay, so... so technically, I
just have to go to that spot

392
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:10,172
and I could run
right back, right?

393
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:12,655
I just need to walk to
the end of the hallway

394
00:26:12,758 --> 00:26:14,068
and come right back.

395
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,000
There and back again.

396
00:26:16,103 --> 00:26:18,793
Like "A Hobbit's Tale."
Okay, I can do this.

397
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:20,416
I can do this. Oh,
shit, I can't do it!

398
00:26:20,482 --> 00:26:23,551
Come on, Shawn, you
can. The sponsors.

399
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:37,655
Okay.

400
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:45,517
All right.

401
00:26:54,103 --> 00:26:56,724
All right, here I
go. Watch me soar.

402
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:02,896
Okay, I'm going, but
I need some support.

403
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,379
Like, can you send me pictures
of cute things like baby pandas

404
00:27:07,482 --> 00:27:09,758
or dogs wearing
clothes and shit.

405
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,758
Shoot. Strike.

406
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,724
Did I leave that open?

407
00:27:34,931 --> 00:27:38,241
Come on, Shawn.
You can do this.

408
00:27:44,103 --> 00:27:45,517
What was that?

409
00:27:57,137 --> 00:27:59,724
It's real! It's real! It's real!

410
00:28:04,344 --> 00:28:07,586
What do you want from me?!

411
00:28:21,862 --> 00:28:24,620
-Oh, my God!

412
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:26,103
Oh, my God.

413
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:28,931
Shawn! I love you so much.

414
00:28:29,034 --> 00:28:30,827
I can't believe it's you!

415
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:32,620
I'm obsessed with watching you.

416
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:34,482
I mean, watching your channel.

417
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:37,689
-How did you find me? You're
not supposed to be here.

418
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:39,620
Oh, it's so good to see a human.

419
00:28:39,724 --> 00:28:41,551
- Can I stay?
- Yes, please.

420
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:43,137
No!

421
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:45,620
Oh, please don't leave me.

422
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,724
Who are you?
- I'm Chrissy.

423
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:50,689
You've probably seen, like,
a bazillion comments from me.

424
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:53,551
I'm QuizCat94.

425
00:28:53,655 --> 00:28:56,000
-Holy crap. Can I just
sit down for a second

426
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:57,413
and process all of this?

427
00:28:57,517 --> 00:28:59,655
-Of course.

428
00:29:06,517 --> 00:29:08,482
Oh, I'm fine.

429
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:12,586
-How did you even figure
out where this place is?

430
00:29:12,689 --> 00:29:15,034
-Oh, it wasn't hard. I just
pieced things together.

431
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:17,044
You accidently gave it
away when you were said...

432
00:29:17,068 --> 00:29:18,413
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop.

433
00:29:18,517 --> 00:29:20,397
I don't want any more
surprise visitors tonight.

434
00:29:20,482 --> 00:29:22,655
So you drove out to
the middle of nowhere

435
00:29:22,758 --> 00:29:24,862
and then an hour down
a sketchy dirt road

436
00:29:24,965 --> 00:29:29,034
in the middle of the night
all by yourself just to...

437
00:29:29,137 --> 00:29:31,000
-I just wanted to
say hi in person.

438
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,631
Also, I can help with
the ghost hunting.

439
00:29:32,655 --> 00:29:34,379
I'm really good at
stuff like that.

440
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:36,586
-Well, obviously I don't
need help ghost hunting.

441
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:39,551
I'm pretty good at drawing them
out all by myself apparently.

442
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:41,827
I'm like a frickin'
salt lick for ghosts.

443
00:29:41,931 --> 00:29:43,137
- Wait, are you leaving?
- Huh?

444
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:45,275
I think I'm just going
to leave my cameras.

445
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:46,631
-Why? I thought you
needed the money.

446
00:29:46,655 --> 00:29:48,931
-You can't pay me
enough to stay here.

447
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:51,275
-Even with the record
amount of views.

448
00:29:52,827 --> 00:29:55,827
-Serious?

449
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:57,724
Oh.

450
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:05,344
Holy crap!

451
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:07,448
-See, Shawn. They
want us to stay.

452
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:09,862
-Chrissy, not trying to
be an A-hole or anything,

453
00:30:09,965 --> 00:30:12,551
but they don't want us to
stay, they want meto stay.

454
00:30:12,655 --> 00:30:16,827
The whole premise here is that
I'm alone in a haunted house.

455
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:19,344
Seriously? You want
her to stay? Okay.

456
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:23,448
All right. I'll make a
poll. Should she stay?

457
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,413
You seriously want her to stay?

458
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:30,379
It's not going to be as
scary with two people here.

459
00:30:32,034 --> 00:30:34,586
-Shawn, are we staying?

460
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:39,034
-The engagement is really
high with you here.

461
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,448
Oh, this is so stupid.

462
00:30:40,551 --> 00:30:43,413
All right, let me
think about this.

463
00:30:43,517 --> 00:30:45,448
Okay. We'll stay.

464
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:47,103
Yes! Yes!

465
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,724
-Hey, sponsors, I
just want to say,

466
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:51,241
I know this is technically
outside of our agreement,

467
00:30:51,344 --> 00:30:52,965
but you saw that
I didn't do this.

468
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:54,310
She came on her own. Okay?

469
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:57,206
-He's telling the truth.
I have never met him.

470
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,965
-Okay.

471
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:01,655
We've got a ghost
to investigate.

472
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:07,689
Here. Take this.

473
00:31:11,517 --> 00:31:13,137
-It's Chrissy.

474
00:31:14,103 --> 00:31:16,206
-All right.

475
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,413
All right, let's hurry
before I think it through.

476
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:32,551
I can't believe I'm
coming out here again.

477
00:31:40,172 --> 00:31:42,413
Hey, turn around. Look that way.

478
00:31:42,517 --> 00:31:45,413
Turn. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Walk backwards like that.

479
00:31:47,482 --> 00:31:51,000
I got eyes in the
back of my head now.

480
00:31:51,103 --> 00:31:54,068
-I think we should go
to the master bedroom.

481
00:31:54,172 --> 00:31:55,689
-No, I don't want
to go down there.

482
00:31:55,793 --> 00:31:58,241
-That's where Corner Man
lives. Isn't that who you saw?

483
00:31:58,344 --> 00:32:00,724
-Okay, fine. We'll
go to his room.

484
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:08,965
-Do I still need
to walk backwards?

485
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:10,827
-Yes, but look up so
we can actually see.

486
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:12,793
-Okay.

487
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:14,551
-Better.

488
00:32:14,931 --> 00:32:17,000
-Hey, Shawn.

489
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,689
I think people
would really like it

490
00:32:18,793 --> 00:32:21,551
if you acted a little
more excited about this.

491
00:32:21,655 --> 00:32:23,655
-Are you fan-splaining
to me right now?

492
00:32:23,758 --> 00:32:26,275
I know what I'm doing.

493
00:32:26,931 --> 00:32:30,034
There it is. That's his room.

494
00:32:30,137 --> 00:32:32,793
Some people legit died in there.

495
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:37,482
Chrissy!

496
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:40,482
Seriously?

497
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:42,344
Chrissy!

498
00:32:44,482 --> 00:32:46,310
Chrissy, what the
hell are you doing?

499
00:32:46,413 --> 00:32:48,379
I'm serious!

500
00:32:48,482 --> 00:32:50,758
You scared me.
What are you doing?

501
00:32:50,862 --> 00:32:53,896
-Sorry. Just hunting for ghosts.

502
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,137
-Okay. Well, new rule.

503
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:59,241
We're not going to
split up, ever. Okay?

504
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:07,517
Okay. Everything seems
calm in there right now.

505
00:33:17,482 --> 00:33:19,896
Hey, to go over there.
That's his space.

506
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,241
You're disrespecting it.

507
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,793
I heard something.

508
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:36,310
-I'm gonna kill her.

509
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:40,413
Before this night is over,
I'm gonna kill Christy.

510
00:33:40,517 --> 00:33:42,379
What is it?

511
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,241
I'm good at checking
out closets.

512
00:33:52,034 --> 00:33:54,310
This sounds like mice.

513
00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:58,034
Whoa!

514
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:00,689
That goes way back there.

515
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,517
Stairs!

516
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:14,482
-Let me see.

517
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:18,517
A secret room.
Let's go down there.

518
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:21,068
-That would be so stupid.

519
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:29,931
Why do you think
they covered this up?

520
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,344
- Maybe they thought...
- Shh!

521
00:34:31,448 --> 00:34:36,137
Oh, smells like a
dead feet in here.

522
00:34:39,448 --> 00:34:42,344
This looks like an old cellar.

523
00:34:44,103 --> 00:34:46,344
Shawn!

524
00:34:47,827 --> 00:34:50,034
-Oh, wow.

525
00:35:00,862 --> 00:35:02,275
What is that?

526
00:35:02,379 --> 00:35:06,275
It's locked. There's
probably money in here.

527
00:35:08,517 --> 00:35:10,896
Do you think some of
this is Mildred's stuff?

528
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,413
-I don't know.

529
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:18,241
What's that?

530
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,137
What is this?

531
00:35:22,241 --> 00:35:24,517
Mildred Pratt?

532
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,275
This must be her journal!

533
00:35:26,379 --> 00:35:30,310
Are we about to uncover
the secret of this house?

534
00:35:31,655 --> 00:35:35,103
"The dianthus are blooming.
The birds are cooing.

535
00:35:35,206 --> 00:35:38,965
Your visage is in
the sunlit canopies."

536
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:41,206
Oh, never mind.
These are just poems.

537
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,862
-That's so cool.
Read another one.

538
00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:44,862
-They don't even rhyme.

539
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:46,413
-What? Let me see.

540
00:35:46,517 --> 00:35:48,103
-What is that?

541
00:35:48,206 --> 00:35:49,517
What is that?!

542
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,275
That is a dead animal!

543
00:35:52,379 --> 00:35:54,137
That is a dead,

544
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:56,448
mummified animal!

545
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:58,241
-No!

546
00:36:01,448 --> 00:36:05,551
-A secret room with
Mildred's stuff.

547
00:36:08,896 --> 00:36:12,724
Do the wheel, please. Yes.
Yes. Let's do the wheel!

548
00:36:12,827 --> 00:36:15,689
I'm actually excited
this time. Let's do it.

549
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:24,655
Here, Chrissy.
You can spin it.

550
00:36:27,206 --> 00:36:28,758
It's on the line. Spin again.

551
00:36:28,862 --> 00:36:31,620
-No, Shawn. It's
not an accident.

552
00:36:31,724 --> 00:36:34,448
Something wants us to do both.

553
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:42,620
-Spirit board.

554
00:36:46,862 --> 00:36:49,000
AVP reporter.

555
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:50,206
-Candles?

556
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,103
-I don't have candles.

557
00:36:52,206 --> 00:36:54,413
I have these.

558
00:37:00,275 --> 00:37:03,482
-To start, I'll need you
to read the poems out loud.

559
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:04,724
-No, they're boring.

560
00:37:04,827 --> 00:37:07,931
- They're not boring.
- Chrissy, this is my show.

561
00:37:08,034 --> 00:37:10,344
Put one of your
hands on this book.

562
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:17,000
Spirits of this house.

563
00:37:17,103 --> 00:37:19,310
We want to talk to the
child spirits of this house.

564
00:37:19,413 --> 00:37:22,413
Not to slendery thing. Please.

565
00:37:22,517 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm now turning the
floor over to Chrissy.

566
00:37:25,103 --> 00:37:27,034
You got this.

567
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:32,241
-How are you, my
spiritual children?

568
00:37:33,758 --> 00:37:35,793
-Listen.

569
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:46,551
Were any of you killed by
the spirit named Mildred?

570
00:37:51,206 --> 00:37:55,344
-Shawn, I know a chant
that always works.

571
00:37:55,448 --> 00:37:57,000
Repeat after me.

572
00:38:00,206 --> 00:38:02,137
-No, I don't say weird
things I don't understand.

573
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:04,217
-Okay, I don't know, like,
the literal translation.

574
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,758
But basically it's an
offering of peace to those

575
00:38:06,862 --> 00:38:08,000
who may not be at peace.

576
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:10,275
Like, maybe the spirit
wasn't satisfied.

577
00:38:10,379 --> 00:38:13,000
Like, maybe they wanted
more out of life.

578
00:38:13,103 --> 00:38:14,517
-Okay. Fine.

579
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,551
-Okay. Repeat after me.

580
00:38:29,793 --> 00:38:31,586
-What was that?

581
00:38:35,206 --> 00:38:37,413
The motion sensors must
have picked up something

582
00:38:37,517 --> 00:38:39,275
in the bathroom.

583
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:42,758
- Let's go check it out.
- No!

584
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,275
-You have to check out the
paranormal activity, Shawn.

585
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:46,724
You made up the rules.

586
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:48,148
-That's what we're
doing right now.

587
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:49,665
We're checking out the
ghost in this room.

588
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:51,872
If there's another ghost when
we're checking out a ghost,

589
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:54,482
it gets canceled out.

590
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:56,724
- "Chrissy's braver
than you." Stop it.

591
00:38:56,827 --> 00:38:58,103
She's not braver than me.

592
00:38:58,206 --> 00:39:00,241
She's just trying to get
out of our board game

593
00:39:00,344 --> 00:39:03,172
because she's obviously losing.

594
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:04,482
- "Your rules, Shawn."

595
00:39:04,586 --> 00:39:06,344
Oh, give me a
freaking break, guys.

596
00:39:06,448 --> 00:39:08,724
I thought you were Wrathies.

597
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:15,172
Okay, just give me a
minute to think about this.

598
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:22,137
-Don't worry, Shawn.

599
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:26,448
I have a feeling that soon
you won't be afraid anymore.

600
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:28,655
-Thank you for that.

601
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:31,655
What if Chrissy goes?

602
00:39:31,758 --> 00:39:33,931
-Sure. I guess.

603
00:39:34,034 --> 00:39:36,758
But you said we
shouldn't separate ever.

604
00:39:36,862 --> 00:39:39,206
-But then I realized we should.

605
00:39:40,896 --> 00:39:42,241
Guys, guys, whoa, whoa.

606
00:39:42,344 --> 00:39:45,068
I'm not making her go
check it out by herself.

607
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:47,482
She's a strong,
independent woman,

608
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:50,758
and she's choosing
to go alone, right?

609
00:39:52,965 --> 00:39:55,241
It's actually better this
way because I can look at

610
00:39:55,344 --> 00:39:58,379
the monitors and let you know
if something's happening.

611
00:40:10,793 --> 00:40:12,689
What was that?

612
00:40:17,724 --> 00:40:19,689
Did that just move?

613
00:40:22,551 --> 00:40:24,310
Oh, crap.

614
00:40:26,068 --> 00:40:27,724
Chrissy?

615
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:33,448
Screw this room.

616
00:40:42,413 --> 00:40:43,758
Chrissy?

617
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:50,344
Chrissy?

618
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,068
Chrissy!

619
00:40:59,551 --> 00:41:01,310
Chrissy!

620
00:41:14,413 --> 00:41:15,758
Chrissy?

621
00:41:19,965 --> 00:41:21,620
Ah!

622
00:41:21,724 --> 00:41:24,206
Stupid... big little lies.

623
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,586
What the "F" is wrong with you?

624
00:41:25,689 --> 00:41:27,034
-You are so jumpy.

625
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:29,413
-Because there are literal
actual ghost things

626
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:31,655
happening to me right
now, and you're up here

627
00:41:31,758 --> 00:41:33,965
pissing around like you
don't care about any of it,

628
00:41:34,068 --> 00:41:35,631
and you're trying to
turn my fans against me.

629
00:41:35,655 --> 00:41:38,620
- Shawn, it's just a joke.
- No, it's not.

630
00:41:38,724 --> 00:41:40,724
Where did you even go?

631
00:41:40,827 --> 00:41:42,482
-Just hiding.

632
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:44,827
-Where, Chrissy? You
disappear so fast.

633
00:41:44,931 --> 00:41:46,286
How do you even
know where to hide?

634
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:49,103
Have you been here before?

635
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,448
Did you get here before I did?

636
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,620
-No, Shawn.

637
00:41:52,724 --> 00:41:55,275
-Then how did you get
in? I locked the door.

638
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,689
- I went through a window.
- Bullshit!

639
00:41:57,793 --> 00:42:01,758
You're not a huge fan.
You're a crazy stalker freak.

640
00:42:01,862 --> 00:42:04,103
This whole thing has turned
into me baby sitting a freak.

641
00:42:04,206 --> 00:42:09,344
Meanwhile, I got 100% legit
demons or ghosts after me.

642
00:42:11,344 --> 00:42:13,137
You are officially uninvited.

643
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:16,413
Now I'm going to go back
in the safe room by myself

644
00:42:16,517 --> 00:42:19,482
and Google how to
exorcise ghost children.

645
00:42:19,586 --> 00:42:21,413
-I don't think
that's a good idea.

646
00:42:21,517 --> 00:42:23,275
-Why not?

647
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:44,689
Oh, shit.

648
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:51,000
Oh, shit.

649
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:56,172
Oh, shit.

650
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,413
Oh, shit. I killed her.

651
00:43:01,517 --> 00:43:03,655
I killed her.

652
00:43:03,758 --> 00:43:06,758
I need the cops.
I need the cops.

653
00:43:08,655 --> 00:43:10,000
Help!

654
00:43:10,103 --> 00:43:12,310
There's been an accident!
I killed someone!

655
00:43:12,413 --> 00:43:14,103
Somebody call the cops!

656
00:43:14,206 --> 00:43:16,620
I'm at the old Pratt
house about 20 miles down

657
00:43:16,724 --> 00:43:18,103
McGreedy Road.

658
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:21,137
I'm gonna drive into
town and turn myself in.

659
00:43:25,448 --> 00:43:28,724
I'm so sorry! It
was an accident!

660
00:43:40,896 --> 00:43:42,655
Chrissy?

661
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,068
Chrissy?

662
00:44:04,931 --> 00:44:06,724
Chrissy?

663
00:44:12,551 --> 00:44:16,241
I'm going to leave a first
aid kit right here for you.

664
00:44:26,103 --> 00:44:29,034
What the hell was that?!

665
00:44:29,137 --> 00:44:31,068
What is that?

666
00:44:41,793 --> 00:44:43,482
It's her.

667
00:44:48,517 --> 00:44:50,482
It's her.

668
00:44:50,586 --> 00:44:51,793
It's Mildred.

669
00:44:51,896 --> 00:44:54,172
Did you guys see that?

670
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,241
"You have to leave."
I can't leave!

671
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:01,034
She's blocking the stairs.

672
00:45:01,137 --> 00:45:03,206
I'm gonna die.

673
00:45:04,724 --> 00:45:06,137
What video?

674
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:10,448
-Shawn, you know that thing
that was hanging in the closet?

675
00:45:10,551 --> 00:45:14,103
Well, I figured out what it
was. A symbol is a hamsa.

676
00:45:14,206 --> 00:45:16,551
It's hard to identify because
it's an ancient version.

677
00:45:16,655 --> 00:45:18,655
But if you look at these
shapes, you can see.

678
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,586
These are the fingers,
and this is the eyes.

679
00:45:20,689 --> 00:45:22,970
- This kid's like 12 years old.
- I don't know if you know

680
00:45:23,034 --> 00:45:24,689
very much about hamsas,
but it's a symbol

681
00:45:24,793 --> 00:45:26,137
that is used to ward off evil.

682
00:45:26,241 --> 00:45:27,827
Everybody uses it...

683
00:45:27,931 --> 00:45:30,344
The Jews, Muslims,
Christians, Pagans.

684
00:45:30,448 --> 00:45:32,113
There's a whole thing
on Wikipedia about it,

685
00:45:32,137 --> 00:45:33,803
but I'm pretty sure that
the people that made it were

686
00:45:33,827 --> 00:45:36,482
trying to keep the evil
spirits of the house at bay.

687
00:45:36,586 --> 00:45:40,275
And my guess is it was probably
working until you destroyed it.

688
00:45:40,379 --> 00:45:41,517
- What?
- I'm sorry, Shawn,

689
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:44,000
but I just wanted to
say I'm a big fan,

690
00:45:44,103 --> 00:45:45,803
and I think you're really
funny, and the world

691
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:47,631
should just forgive you
because you're a good person

692
00:45:47,655 --> 00:45:51,000
and everybody's too
sensitive these days.

693
00:45:54,724 --> 00:45:56,586
-I unleased her.

694
00:45:56,689 --> 00:45:59,034
I unleashed Mildred.

695
00:45:59,137 --> 00:46:01,793
Somebody help me!

696
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:05,137
"Push past her..."

697
00:46:05,241 --> 00:46:08,586
I can't! I can't!

698
00:46:08,689 --> 00:46:11,724
Come on, Shawn.

699
00:46:11,827 --> 00:46:14,758
"If she had the power to attack
you, she would have done it."

700
00:46:14,862 --> 00:46:17,482
Okay, okay.

701
00:46:17,586 --> 00:46:21,586
I'm gonna go try to
squeeze past her.

702
00:48:22,586 --> 00:48:25,482
Yes. Yes

703
00:48:25,586 --> 00:48:26,827
That's not my key.

704
00:48:43,758 --> 00:48:46,448
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

705
00:48:51,448 --> 00:48:54,724
Ah!

706
00:49:00,206 --> 00:49:03,551
Where are the cops? I need
help. I can't get out.

707
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,965
"Maybe you're supposed to
use the key to open the box."

708
00:49:09,068 --> 00:49:11,068
How's that supposed to help?

709
00:49:17,034 --> 00:49:19,206
It fits.

710
00:49:25,206 --> 00:49:29,448
Chrissy is Mildred!

711
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,448
I can't just jump out a window.

712
00:49:58,344 --> 00:50:01,965
This is crazy. No way am
I going back upstairs.

713
00:51:04,482 --> 00:51:07,689
-They're not going to
let me out of this house!

714
00:51:09,517 --> 00:51:13,172
I can't leave. I've just
gonna wait for the cops.

715
00:51:15,896 --> 00:51:18,275
What do you mean she owns me?

716
00:51:19,344 --> 00:51:22,172
-Shawn, I'm a Latin professor
at Brown University.

717
00:51:22,275 --> 00:51:24,493
I've translated the Latin that
you spoke early in the night

718
00:51:24,517 --> 00:51:26,896
when you tried to
talk to the dead.

719
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,551
Shawn, that woman lied to you.

720
00:51:28,655 --> 00:51:30,379
- What?
- This is the actual translation

721
00:51:30,482 --> 00:51:32,068
of what you said.

722
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,896
I give thee my soul
and forfeit my will.

723
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,862
- Oh, no.
- I'm sorry, Shawn.

724
00:51:36,965 --> 00:51:38,620
-Can I help?

725
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:41,413
Shawn, we have a theory
about what's been happening

726
00:51:41,517 --> 00:51:42,827
at the house.

727
00:51:42,931 --> 00:51:45,551
We think that every ghost
lives there used to be alive,

728
00:51:45,655 --> 00:51:48,448
like you, Mildred totally
messes with people's minds

729
00:51:48,551 --> 00:51:50,965
and tries to make them
depressed and psycho

730
00:51:51,068 --> 00:51:53,379
and not themselves until
eventually she gets them

731
00:51:53,482 --> 00:51:55,379
to say the chant that
you said you said.

732
00:51:55,482 --> 00:51:57,827
So, Shawn, now that you said
the words, I'm afraid that

733
00:51:57,931 --> 00:51:59,182
you might feel like
killing yourself.

734
00:51:59,206 --> 00:52:01,034
- That's enough.
- Don't die, Shawn.

735
00:52:03,413 --> 00:52:05,551
-Oh, no.

736
00:52:07,275 --> 00:52:09,517
I'm not going to kill myself!

737
00:52:11,137 --> 00:52:13,000
Karma for what I did?

738
00:52:13,103 --> 00:52:15,344
I didn't do anything wrong.

739
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,793
I apologized because I had to.

740
00:52:18,896 --> 00:52:22,275
I lost everything. My
parents got death threats.

741
00:52:22,379 --> 00:52:26,379
I was acquitted, by the way.
No one ever mentions that.

742
00:52:28,931 --> 00:52:32,206
I never said I was a role model!

743
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:35,655
I'm sick of apologizing
for being myself!

744
00:52:35,758 --> 00:52:41,103
I regret apologizing, and
that's the only thing I regret!

745
00:52:41,206 --> 00:52:43,137
I didn't know he was sick!

746
00:52:43,241 --> 00:52:46,068
He signed a waiver!

747
00:52:46,172 --> 00:52:48,620
I'm not racist!
- Shawn.

748
00:52:48,724 --> 00:52:50,344
What was that?

749
00:52:58,896 --> 00:53:00,758
-Guilty!

750
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,413
Ouch.

751
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:35,413
Ah! Ow, my legs!

752
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,620
Oh, I can't look.

753
00:53:39,724 --> 00:53:42,413
I can't look.

754
00:53:43,586 --> 00:53:47,103
Okay. I'll look.

755
00:53:55,965 --> 00:53:57,517
I shouldn't have looked!

756
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,758
Where are the cops?!

757
00:54:02,827 --> 00:54:04,827
Clean it?

758
00:54:04,931 --> 00:54:07,344
Okay.

759
00:54:39,793 --> 00:54:41,517
Oh, no.

760
00:54:57,068 --> 00:54:59,103
Spark plugs.

761
00:55:26,793 --> 00:55:29,586
Spark plugs.

762
00:55:29,689 --> 00:55:31,379
Yes!

763
00:55:32,724 --> 00:55:35,310
Oh. Yes, yes. Yes.

764
00:55:37,275 --> 00:55:38,758
Ah!

765
00:55:49,965 --> 00:55:52,206
-Are you Shawn Ruddy?

766
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,000
-Yes.

767
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:58,551
Oh, you're my
freakin' hero, man!

768
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,448
- Okay, son.
- You're never gonna hear me

769
00:56:00,551 --> 00:56:02,896
say another bad thing
about the police, I swear.

770
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,724
-Okay. I'm just happy to help.

771
00:56:08,068 --> 00:56:10,000
-We have to get
out of here fast.

772
00:56:10,103 --> 00:56:12,827
Where's your car? I
don't see your car, man.

773
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:18,241
-I've been watching tonight.
It's some really great stuff.

774
00:56:18,724 --> 00:56:20,206
-What?

775
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,724
-But I really don't like it
when you hurt people, Shawn.

776
00:56:23,827 --> 00:56:25,586
-No, no, no.

777
00:56:25,689 --> 00:56:27,931
-You really shouldn't
hurt people, Shawn.

778
00:56:28,034 --> 00:56:30,482
-Is that what this is about?

779
00:56:30,586 --> 00:56:34,172
I would never hurt
anyone on purpose!

780
00:56:34,275 --> 00:56:37,103
Except for you, mother frogger!

781
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:39,482
Bitch!

782
00:56:39,586 --> 00:56:41,482
Strike. Ah!

783
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:06,482
I can't see.

784
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:17,137
Yes.

785
00:57:49,413 --> 00:57:51,724
Oh, no! Ah!

786
00:57:51,827 --> 00:57:54,275
Ah!

787
00:57:56,034 --> 00:57:59,206
Help me! They're
coming to get me!

788
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:05,137
I can't go back out there.
You saw what was in the woods.

789
00:58:06,758 --> 00:58:10,793
Hamsa lady? Who's hamsa lady?

790
00:58:10,896 --> 00:58:12,896
-Grandma were talking to
that guy I told you about.

791
00:58:12,931 --> 00:58:15,724
He's in the house right
now. Tell him who you are.

792
00:58:15,827 --> 00:58:17,896
-My name is Hedy.

793
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,275
When I was 15 years old,

794
00:58:20,379 --> 00:58:23,137
I lived in the Pratt
house as a nanny.

795
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:24,655
-No way! She lived here?

796
00:58:24,758 --> 00:58:28,103
-There's a vengeful spirit
in the house named Mildred.

797
00:58:28,206 --> 00:58:32,172
She came after me,
but I created a ward

798
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:35,068
to keep her powers at bay.

799
00:58:35,172 --> 00:58:37,344
It's in upstairs closet.

800
00:58:37,448 --> 00:58:39,379
-He destroyed the
house, Grandma.

801
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:42,344
-Aw, shit. He's going to die.

802
00:58:42,448 --> 00:58:43,896
Can you
tell him how to make

803
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,241
a new hamsa?
- Yes!

804
00:58:45,344 --> 00:58:47,551
Tell me how to put it back.

805
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:53,241
Oh, crap! Ah! Hurry.

806
00:58:53,344 --> 00:58:57,000
-She sold her soul to the devil.

807
00:58:57,103 --> 00:59:00,034
That's why she
has so much power.

808
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:01,586
-Talk faster.

809
00:59:01,689 --> 00:59:03,286
And
that's why your hamsa

810
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:05,172
must be equally powerful.

811
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:08,000
-Ah! He's coming! Ah!

812
00:59:08,103 --> 00:59:11,206
-Let this be an
important lesson.

813
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:14,137
The devil always betrays you.

814
00:59:14,241 --> 00:59:16,206
-Come on. Just tell
me how to do it!

815
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:21,241
-First, you must remember that
all worthwhile counter vigils

816
00:59:21,344 --> 00:59:24,034
require a sacrifice of flesh.

817
00:59:24,137 --> 00:59:27,241
Aaaah!

818
00:59:41,827 --> 00:59:44,586
Oh, God. I need a weapon.

819
00:59:47,862 --> 00:59:49,758
Potato gun.

820
00:59:49,862 --> 00:59:51,724
Potatoes.

821
00:59:51,827 --> 00:59:53,517
Come on!

822
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:57,068
Come on.

823
01:00:01,758 --> 01:00:03,172
-Aaah!

824
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,517
Yes.

825
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,862
Shawn! Shawn! Shawn!

826
01:00:44,551 --> 01:00:46,689
No, no, no, no, no!

827
01:00:46,793 --> 01:00:49,620
Ah! Ah! No! Ah!

828
01:00:51,586 --> 01:00:53,551
No! Ah! No, no!

829
01:00:53,655 --> 01:00:56,413
Aaah! Aah!

830
01:01:06,275 --> 01:01:09,413
Did you see that,
Internet?

831
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:18,413
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

832
01:01:18,517 --> 01:01:20,137
No!

833
01:01:38,034 --> 01:01:41,586
Somebody help! I'm dying!

834
01:01:43,103 --> 01:01:46,896
I don't even know if
I'm still streaming.

835
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,655
This is not the way
I imagined going out!

836
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,931
I was supposed to
repair my image.

837
01:01:56,034 --> 01:01:59,000
I don't want to be
remembered as a douchebag.

838
01:01:59,103 --> 01:02:02,517
Freaking Mildred!
She's such a C.

839
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:06,620
Maybe this is karma.
Is God smiting me?

840
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:09,000
I'm sorry. Okay?

841
01:02:09,103 --> 01:02:12,206
I'm sorry.

842
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:13,896
No one can even hear me.

843
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,413
Need to leave a note.

844
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:26,655
"Unholy hand of power"?

845
01:02:26,758 --> 01:02:29,275
"Influence others with
the power of your word."

846
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:31,862
This looks like
some kind of ritual.

847
01:02:31,965 --> 01:02:35,275
This must be what she
did to sell her soul.

848
01:02:35,379 --> 01:02:39,172
Who knew this was
actually a thing?

849
01:02:39,275 --> 01:02:42,482
Maybe there's something else.

850
01:02:42,586 --> 01:02:45,551
"Nothing changes. I am
still, still, still.

851
01:02:45,655 --> 01:02:49,103
I am like the pond water.
The pond water is still!"

852
01:02:49,206 --> 01:02:52,689
Pond water! That's what
the ghosts keep repeating.

853
01:02:52,793 --> 01:02:55,793
She's forcing them to
memorize her poetry.

854
01:02:55,896 --> 01:02:57,413
What a freaking weirdo.

855
01:02:57,517 --> 01:03:01,241
She's like me. She
wants an audience.

856
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:04,068
She kept trying to get
me to read her poems.

857
01:03:04,172 --> 01:03:07,310
And her fiancé
was a publisher.

858
01:03:07,413 --> 01:03:09,586
She's not creating a family.

859
01:03:09,689 --> 01:03:11,344
She's building a following.

860
01:03:11,448 --> 01:03:13,172
And I bet the more
souls she collects,

861
01:03:13,275 --> 01:03:16,034
the more powerful she becomes.

862
01:03:17,068 --> 01:03:20,034
And what can hurt
someone like me?

863
01:03:22,275 --> 01:03:26,275
Copy strike, a copy strike!

864
01:03:26,379 --> 01:03:28,241
Remember when I did that
sewer surfing video,

865
01:03:28,344 --> 01:03:30,413
and I started
singing "Surfin USA"?

866
01:03:30,517 --> 01:03:33,034
Well, the Beach Boys record
label put a copy strike

867
01:03:33,137 --> 01:03:35,551
on it and claimed all
my money for that video.

868
01:03:35,655 --> 01:03:39,517
What if I put a copy strike
on Mildred? Forget the hamsa.

869
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:43,103
If I can do this same unholy
hand ritual that she did,

870
01:03:43,206 --> 01:03:45,310
I can claim her revenue,
her power source.

871
01:03:45,413 --> 01:03:49,620
Are you following? I can
get my soul back!

872
01:03:49,724 --> 01:03:51,172
This looks like a Latin.

873
01:03:51,275 --> 01:03:54,448
Internet, please translate
these words for me.

874
01:03:54,551 --> 01:03:58,137
I'm going to need these words
by the time I get to my laptop.

875
01:04:07,068 --> 01:04:10,068
Let's de-monetize this bitch.

876
01:06:06,448 --> 01:06:07,965
Hey, Mildred!

877
01:06:08,068 --> 01:06:10,620
Believe me when I
say I understand

878
01:06:10,724 --> 01:06:13,103
why you do what you do.

879
01:06:13,206 --> 01:06:17,586
But in the words of my manager,

880
01:06:17,689 --> 01:06:20,586
you've taken things too far.

881
01:06:20,689 --> 01:06:23,310
Way too far.

882
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:15,137
I'm still streaming!

883
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:17,862
Can you guys hear me?

884
01:07:17,965 --> 01:07:20,206
You translated the
words. Thank you.

885
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:23,517
Death becomes
unholy with the power of my...

886
01:07:25,965 --> 01:07:27,344
Oh, crap.

887
01:07:27,448 --> 01:07:30,206
Thank you so much, Internet.

888
01:07:41,068 --> 01:07:43,241
Wrathies, I don't
have a lot of time,

889
01:07:43,344 --> 01:07:45,206
but I think it's
probably pretty obvious

890
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:47,724
to everyone that I'm not going
to make it out of here alive.

891
01:07:47,827 --> 01:07:50,172
And I just wanted to
thank you for helping me

892
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:52,137
and supporting me.

893
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:54,689
The truth is I think
I've known for a while

894
01:07:54,793 --> 01:07:57,448
that I've been crossing a line.

895
01:07:57,551 --> 01:08:00,862
I wish I could go back and
change some stuff, but I can't.

896
01:08:00,965 --> 01:08:06,241
And so I wanted to apologize,
but for realsies this time.

897
01:08:06,344 --> 01:08:09,862
I'm sorry to everyone
I've hurt with my stunts.

898
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:11,620
It was wrong of me
to pay a homeless man

899
01:08:11,724 --> 01:08:13,413
to fight me for a video.

900
01:08:13,517 --> 01:08:15,862
He seemed so much bigger
than me, and I didn't think

901
01:08:15,965 --> 01:08:17,620
I could actually hurt him.

902
01:08:17,724 --> 01:08:19,379
But I apologize for hurting him.

903
01:08:19,482 --> 01:08:21,103
But what I didn't apologize for

904
01:08:21,206 --> 01:08:24,241
was for thinking of
it in the first place.

905
01:08:24,344 --> 01:08:30,310
And also, I want to
apologize to the minorities.

906
01:08:30,413 --> 01:08:32,586
A lot of you thought
that I was making light

907
01:08:32,689 --> 01:08:33,862
of a serious situation

908
01:08:33,965 --> 01:08:35,758
when I got smuggled
across the border.

909
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,137
That wasn't funny.

910
01:08:37,241 --> 01:08:39,689
I mean, it was, but
for the wrong reasons.

911
01:08:39,793 --> 01:08:41,517
And I'm sorry.

912
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:45,275
I have been racially and
culturally insensitive.

913
01:08:45,379 --> 01:08:48,620
But I've learned,
and I've grown.

914
01:08:49,827 --> 01:08:54,137
In fact, I'd like to
dedicate this broadcast

915
01:08:54,241 --> 01:08:56,344
to the Blacks and Mexicans.

916
01:08:56,448 --> 01:08:58,724
This is for you.

917
01:09:09,241 --> 01:09:12,241
This is Shawn Ruddy
promising you the most

918
01:09:12,344 --> 01:09:15,241
cinematic experience
in live streaming.

919
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:40,448
Mildred! I'm waiting!

920
01:09:41,896 --> 01:09:44,551
My soul is waiting!

921
01:09:47,724 --> 01:09:49,482
Fine.

922
01:09:58,379 --> 01:10:01,931
"Echo my heart. Echo my
soul. Bring my voice..."

923
01:10:06,172 --> 01:10:08,827
"Blackbirds roam,
their voices moan."

924
01:10:08,931 --> 01:10:11,517
I mean, some of these
are pretty good.

925
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:12,517
Not.

926
01:10:36,586 --> 01:10:39,206
Hey, little guy.

927
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,413
I'm not gonna hurt you.

928
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:44,793
I think we can both
agree that mommy's

929
01:10:44,896 --> 01:10:46,827
a little bit nuts, right?

930
01:10:46,931 --> 01:10:49,517
I was thinking maybe
we could join f...

931
01:10:59,344 --> 01:11:01,448
Ah!

932
01:11:03,689 --> 01:11:05,551
-Shawn!

933
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:10,551
You're going to face me yourself
or just send your child army

934
01:11:10,655 --> 01:11:13,034
after me like a
frickin' PewDiePie?

935
01:11:13,137 --> 01:11:16,620
-Shawny. Come get me.

936
01:11:16,724 --> 01:11:19,068
-You come get me!

937
01:11:19,172 --> 01:11:21,551
- You come get me.
- Opposite!

938
01:11:24,206 --> 01:11:27,344
I'll find you in
the hallway cam.

939
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:30,655
What the hell is that?

940
01:11:30,758 --> 01:11:32,620
Ah!

941
01:11:32,724 --> 01:11:36,551
Corner Man, I saw you!

942
01:11:41,689 --> 01:11:43,275
Ah!

943
01:11:43,379 --> 01:11:45,862
I got you, you lazy...

944
01:11:45,965 --> 01:11:48,448
Okay. Wait, wait,
wait. Wait, no!

945
01:11:52,655 --> 01:11:54,689
Garlic!

946
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:59,896
Garlic is bullshit!

947
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:05,758
Ah!

948
01:12:09,482 --> 01:12:10,689
-Shawn?

949
01:12:12,206 --> 01:12:14,862
Shawn, I'm scared.

950
01:12:14,965 --> 01:12:19,172
Help me, please. You
hurt me real bad.

951
01:12:19,275 --> 01:12:21,793
-That's not gonna work, Mildred.

952
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,034
Oh, shit.

953
01:12:31,551 --> 01:12:33,068
Mildred!

954
01:12:33,172 --> 01:12:35,862
Maybe I can help. I
have the Internet.

955
01:12:35,965 --> 01:12:40,068
There's a lot of nice people on
the Internet that like to help.

956
01:12:44,034 --> 01:12:45,931
No, no, no, no, no.

957
01:12:46,034 --> 01:12:47,448
No.

958
01:12:50,172 --> 01:12:52,758
Come on. Turn on.

959
01:12:52,862 --> 01:12:55,482
Turn on!

960
01:12:55,586 --> 01:12:57,206
-Shawn.

961
01:12:57,310 --> 01:12:59,448
I want you to meet someone.

962
01:13:15,172 --> 01:13:17,241
What?!

963
01:13:17,344 --> 01:13:19,068
Help!

964
01:13:20,724 --> 01:13:23,620
This feels so good.

965
01:13:32,034 --> 01:13:33,862
Hey.

966
01:13:33,965 --> 01:13:36,000
No way.

967
01:13:38,551 --> 01:13:41,896
Mm.

968
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,827
Mm-hmm.

969
01:13:45,137 --> 01:13:48,275
No! Mildred!

970
01:13:50,689 --> 01:13:54,000
The pond water is still.

971
01:14:04,689 --> 01:14:09,448
Mildred, no! No!

972
01:14:17,793 --> 01:14:20,586
No, Mildred!

973
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,793
I am the influencer!

974
01:14:22,896 --> 01:14:25,137
Ah!

975
01:14:47,172 --> 01:14:50,172
Aaaah!

976
01:15:11,931 --> 01:15:14,241
Garlic may not work on ghosts.

977
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:17,172
But if there's one thing
the movies have taught me,

978
01:15:17,275 --> 01:15:19,689
it's that holy water will f...

979
01:15:45,965 --> 01:15:47,551
I'm gonna kill her.

980
01:15:47,655 --> 01:15:49,586
Again.

981
01:16:18,896 --> 01:16:20,620
Watch your hands! Gotcha!

982
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:31,517
No!
- Smash it!

983
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,241
Shawn.

984
01:16:40,689 --> 01:16:43,344
Aaah!

985
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:51,758
Okay.

986
01:17:54,931 --> 01:17:56,344
-Surprise, bitch!

987
01:18:28,758 --> 01:18:30,482
Goodbye, Mildred.

988
01:18:30,586 --> 01:18:33,000
I hope you enjoy hell.

989
01:18:33,896 --> 01:18:37,689
Death becomes unholy with
the power of my unholy hand.

990
01:18:37,793 --> 01:18:39,689
I use the power of my will,

991
01:18:39,793 --> 01:18:43,758
my words, my
passion, my ambition,

992
01:18:43,862 --> 01:18:46,827
and my authority
to take the souls

993
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:51,172
of this house and
bind them to me!

994
01:18:57,310 --> 01:19:01,586
Wait, wait. No, no,
no. Wait, wait, wait.

995
01:19:16,068 --> 01:19:18,482
Why?! No!

996
01:19:23,965 --> 01:19:25,689
No!

997
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:47,413
No!

998
01:20:14,413 --> 01:20:15,448
-Bad Shawny.

999
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:43,586
-I don't understand
what happened.

1000
01:20:43,689 --> 01:20:44,862
I said the words.

1001
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:48,137
-I'm coming to get...

1002
01:20:52,689 --> 01:20:54,379
-Ow.

1003
01:20:59,103 --> 01:21:01,551
What does she want?

1004
01:21:01,655 --> 01:21:03,448
It's over.

1005
01:21:03,551 --> 01:21:06,206
-Subscribe.

1006
01:21:09,034 --> 01:21:11,068
-Goodbye, Internet.

1007
01:21:11,172 --> 01:21:13,482
I'm sorry I let you down.

1008
01:21:23,896 --> 01:21:26,931
-That's that nasty finger.

1009
01:21:27,034 --> 01:21:29,620
What is it with
Mildred and fingers?

1010
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:34,241
-A sacrifice of flesh.

1011
01:21:34,344 --> 01:21:37,103
That old lady said
that the cult rituals

1012
01:21:37,206 --> 01:21:39,758
require a sacrifice of flesh.

1013
01:21:41,586 --> 01:21:43,758
That's Mildred's finger.

1014
01:21:46,517 --> 01:21:48,137
Hey, Millie!

1015
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:51,724
I'm about to put a ripple
in your pond water.

1016
01:21:51,827 --> 01:21:55,689
Death becomes unholy with
the power of my unholy hand.

1017
01:21:55,793 --> 01:21:59,896
I use the power of my
will, my words, my passion,

1018
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,103
my ambition, and my authority!

1019
01:22:03,206 --> 01:22:05,655
To take the souls
of this house...

1020
01:22:07,862 --> 01:22:10,000
And bind them...

1021
01:22:11,137 --> 01:22:12,551
to me!

1022
01:22:55,724 --> 01:22:58,793
I did it!

1023
01:22:58,896 --> 01:23:00,655
Oh.

1024
01:23:33,862 --> 01:23:35,931
I did it.

1025
01:23:36,034 --> 01:23:37,034
No, wedid it!

1026
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:41,103
We beat this house!

1027
01:23:41,206 --> 01:23:45,241
I just want to take a minute
and think all of my fans.

1028
01:23:45,344 --> 01:23:47,931
I'm getting a little emosh.

1029
01:23:48,034 --> 01:23:51,344
We beat this house,
you guys!

1030
01:23:51,448 --> 01:23:54,413
Suck on that, Huffington Post!

1031
01:23:54,517 --> 01:23:56,344
Ow!

1032
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:59,724
Oh, my leg is definitely broken.

1033
01:24:01,724 --> 01:24:03,344
I told you!

1034
01:24:03,448 --> 01:24:08,241
No one off you a more cinematic
experience in live streaming.

1035
01:24:08,344 --> 01:24:10,965
I, Shawn Ruddy, am once again

1036
01:24:11,068 --> 01:24:13,103
the number one
live streamer in...

1037
01:24:24,482 --> 01:24:26,068
No!
