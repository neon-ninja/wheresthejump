1
00:00:04,493 --> 00:00:06,563
(young boy hums ''Paint It Black'')

2
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:32,964
OK.

3
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:38,085
- (guitar strumming)
- Jackson came over to play.

4
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,368
(sings) Superheroes!

5
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:48,405
I was Black Power Ranger.

6
00:00:53,573 --> 00:00:56,485
He was Batman.

7
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:58,643
Jake, are you OK in there, buddy?

8
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:00,724
I'm OK.

9
00:01:03,093 --> 00:01:05,323
Can I ask you a question?

10
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:08,564
OK! Time to hit the sack.

11
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:12,328
- An important question.
- There we go, big guy. Come on.

12
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:14,165
(groans)

13
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:19,088
- Can I wear bugs?
- Bug pyjamas... are all the way downstairs.

14
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:21,164
But fire trucks are here.

15
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:22,845
- Bugs.
- Fire trucks.

16
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,452
- Bugs.
- Fire trucks.

17
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:27,331
- Bugs.
- OK, bugs.

18
00:01:28,293 --> 00:01:30,682
I'll be right back.

19
00:01:38,453 --> 00:01:40,842
(eerie whispering)

20
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:44,927
Does it hurt to be dead?

21
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:54,362
- Animal.
- What did I do now?

22
00:01:54,453 --> 00:01:56,364
- Can I tell him?
- If you wanna die.

23
00:01:56,453 --> 00:01:58,921
- Well, your beer-addled sperm still work.
- Lisa!

24
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:01,766
- You impregnated my sister again.
- Bitch!

25
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:04,321
- I thought you wanted me to?
- I said ''Don't''!

26
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:07,450
The kid could have been born
before he'd notice.

27
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:12,561
- You're not pregnant.
- I feel ''Congratulations'' is more appropriate.

28
00:02:12,653 --> 00:02:15,326
- You told her before you told me.
- She's a witch!

29
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:18,211
She took one look at me and guessed.

30
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:20,762
Say something!

31
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:22,764
Bummer.

32
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:25,004
Something else!

33
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:31,605
So... she's six weeks pregnant.
That means the baby's due in April, May,...

34
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:34,811
..June. Gemini. That's cool.
Einstein was a Gemini.

35
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:38,886
- So's that Scottish gal from Garbage.
- Will you go help Jake with his pyjamas?

36
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:41,567
- If she's late...
- Lisa, I swear to God,...

37
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:45,441
..start with the Dionne Warwick stuff,
I'll throw you out the fuckin' window.

38
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:49,242
- So please help him with the pyjamas.
- Love you, too, Tom(!)

39
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:53,007
Hey, this is great. I mean it.

40
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:56,529
It's about time we had another kid.
I was gonna bring it up myself.

41
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:58,604
- Really(?)
- Absolutely!

42
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:02,368
- This time, you gotta take some time off.
- Please! We can't afford that!

43
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:06,810
- We can. I'm gonna hit the overtime again.
- I don't want you to work those hours again.

44
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:10,488
You come home in a trance.
You're completely useless to me.

45
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:12,768
I'm gonna be fine, OK?

46
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:16,641
I'm just gonna tell Teddy
to get somebody else for the thing.

47
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:19,531
- Oh, God! Oh, Tom!
- What?

48
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:22,730
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.
No wonder you're pissed off.

49
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:27,011
I'm not pissed off. I just...
No, I'm... I'm not. I'm not.

50
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:31,883
I'm a grown man. I shouldn't be screwing
around with some shitty band anyway.

51
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:36,205
Hey, look, l-l... I gotta go change.
You know, put on something cool.

52
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,644
I love you.

53
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:45,531
I'm... I'm a happy guy.

54
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:53,531
You know, I'm not gonna be a lineman
forever, I promise you that.

55
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,928
Whaddaya mean?

56
00:03:57,013 --> 00:04:00,005
I clip... clip wire all day.
A monkey could do it.

57
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:03,449
Yeah, but they're gonna
move you into the office soon.

58
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:08,846
No, I meant, when we first got together, I said
a lotta stuff about what I was gonna be,...

59
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:14,007
..and I just wanted you to know that, uh...
I wasn't giving you some kinda line,...

60
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:16,653
..that I meant it.

61
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:22,521
I didn't marry you because I thought
you were gonna be famous.

62
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,730
I just liked the way your ass looked in jeans.

63
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:33,161
I never wanted to be famous. I just, uh...
I didn't expect to be... so...

64
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:35,050
What?

65
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,283
I don't know.

66
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:39,489
Ordinary.

67
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:44,647
(footsteps)

68
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:06,885
(eerie whispering)

69
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,324
Shhh.

70
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:19,608
Hang on! Hang on!

71
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:30,843
You know, I hope it's a girl.

72
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:35,245
I'm kinda sick of all these balls
around the house. Except for yours, babe.

73
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,723
What are the odds on an educated single man
being at this thing?

74
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:40,804
And I don't mean a GED!

75
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:45,330
- Does it matter if he's on the boner pill?
- I wouldn't look a gift-boner in the mouth.

76
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:47,927
(Tom) Nice - that's very nice, Lisa(!)

77
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:53,249
- Hey! How you been?
- Hey, Tom, Tom, Tommy! How ya doin'?

78
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,289
Oh, you would not believe the day I had.

79
00:05:55,373 --> 00:05:57,489
- Take this. I'll get another.
- Thanks.

80
00:05:57,573 --> 00:06:00,406
- Harry.
- Tom. Taking care of the place for me?

81
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,963
We're drilling holes all over your floors(!)
I hope you don't mind.

82
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:06,647
Tom, you know my squaw Sheila.
Bobby, Vanessa.

83
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,965
- Thanks for having me.
- Drink up! Take your medicine.

84
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:13,044
Tom, how do you like the neighbourhood?

85
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:16,682
I grew up in Bridgeport,
so it's not like it's a foreign country.

86
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:20,448
You're goddamn right.
This is the best neighbourhood in Chicago.

87
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:25,527
We all look out for each other. That's
saying a lot as we approach the year 2000.

88
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:28,605
- Are you running for mayor(?)
- Hey, did any of you guys...

89
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:31,890
- ..see them crank dealers...
- What is Lenny doing here?

90
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:34,043
Bobby, did you tell him you had a party?

91
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:39,491
- Vanessa made me. We invited everybody.
- To actually invite this jack-off...!

92
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:41,564
Oh, yeah, laugh it up(!)

93
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:45,168
When you wake up dead with your throat cut,
don't come crying to me!

94
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:48,891
Not attracted to.

95
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:52,167
Not drunk enough for.

96
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:53,971
Frightened by!

97
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,324
Argh!

98
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:11,443
Don't touch me. I'm fine.

99
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:15,964
(Jake's breathing)

100
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:35,486
Haven't you heard about people being
operated on when they're under hypnosis?

101
00:07:35,573 --> 00:07:37,564
Yeah, but I don't believe in any of that.

102
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:41,168
People who say they were hypnotised
were just playing along.

103
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,527
- (Tom) Right.
- Really?

104
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:47,641
Then how could they have a scalpel stuck
into their throat without even bleeding?

105
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,849
- Bullshit!
- You never saw that happen!

106
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:52,208
- That's bullshit!
- Learn another word!

107
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,443
Yeah, what about ''narrow-minded''?

108
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:59,209
I saw a guy in my class get a two-inch needle
stuck into his arm by my instructor...

109
00:07:59,293 --> 00:08:02,729
- ..when he was under hypnosis.
- Horseshit! That better, honey?

110
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:05,327
I saw a picture of it the next day.
It left a mark.

111
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:08,962
What I don't understand is
how a person that's been to college...

112
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,283
..can believe all that superstitious crap.

113
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:13,568
- (Lisa) It isn't superstitious!
- Come on!

114
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:16,929
- I'm practically a licensed hypnotherapist.
- ''Practically''?

115
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:20,323
Isn't that like saying
''I don't have a licence''? Ow! My arm!

116
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:25,612
This may come as a surprise to you, but just
because you lived here for your whole life...

117
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:29,242
..doesn't mean that there isn't
a whole larger world out there,...

118
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:34,009
..doorways you haven't even opened, things
you wouldn't have any understanding of.

119
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:38,132
(man) Doorways... OK, OK. All right, Kreskin,
prove it - hypnotise somebody.

120
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:40,488
- Yeah! Do me.
- No.

121
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:42,564
- Why not?
- For one, you're hostile.

122
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:45,042
I'm not hostile!
Do I seem hostile to anybody?

123
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:48,887
- Uh... yeah.
- Thanks for having us. It was a great party.

124
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:53,603
Nah, nah, this is just getting good.
Come on, Lisa. Hypnotise me. Come on!

125
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:55,888
- No. You're drunk.
- I'm not drunk!

126
00:08:55,973 --> 00:08:59,409
You're not supposed to mesmerise
somebody who's been drinking!

127
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:02,565
Mesmerise! No! Stop!

128
00:09:02,653 --> 00:09:05,292
Oh, please! I'm begging you.
Educate the savages.

129
00:09:05,373 --> 00:09:08,251
It won't work with
that kind of uncooperative attitude.

130
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,530
I swear to you, I'll follow
every instruction to the letter.

131
00:09:11,613 --> 00:09:13,604
It still won't work.

132
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,285
Come on.

133
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:18,171
What's the worst that can happen?

134
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:22,803
- Somebody turn out the lights.
- (man) Oh, yeah!

135
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:25,248
- (laughter)
- (man) Whoo!

136
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:31,363
(Lisa) All right, just relax. Put your arm down.
Just rest it comfortably. Just lean back.

137
00:09:31,453 --> 00:09:33,967
Just be very comfortable and relaxed.

138
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:37,047
Trust me. OK?

139
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:41,772
- Close your eyes.
- Certainly, Lisa.

140
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:47,730
Now... just listen for a moment.

141
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:51,123
Listen to the sounds of the room around you.

142
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,250
(woman whispers)
I don't know why, but I'm scared.

143
00:09:56,173 --> 00:09:59,722
(Lisa) Now I want you to pretend
you're in a theatre.

144
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:02,407
A movie theatre,

145
00:10:04,693 --> 00:10:07,082
You're the only one there.

146
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:11,244
It's one of those great old movie palaces.

147
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:16,610
When you look around,
it's a huge, empty theatre.

148
00:10:17,613 --> 00:10:22,607
You notice that the walls of the theatre
are painted in black.

149
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:28,729
The seats... are covered in black.

150
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,767
And in the whole pitch-black theatre,...

151
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:36,847
..there's only one thing you can see,
and that's the white screen.

152
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:41,802
You'll notice there are letters on the screen -
tall, thick, black letters.

153
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:47,251
But they're out of focus, so you drift closer
to them in your chair, trying to read them.

154
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:51,406
You're very comfortable now.
It's your favourite chair.

155
00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:55,486
You're drifting closer and closer,
staring at the letters.

156
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:58,690
Very relaxed now. Your legs are relaxed.

157
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:01,003
Your arms are limp and heavy.

158
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,051
You're almost close enough
to read the letters now.

159
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:06,408
They start to come into focus.

160
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:09,087
The letters spell ''sleep''.

161
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:12,684
Sleep.

162
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,533
No!

163
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:22,127
- What the hell was that?
- (laughter)

164
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:29,608
- What? What? What?
- Are you OK? You had to be faking it.

165
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:32,571
That was the weirdest goddamn thing
I've seen in my life!

166
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:36,566
Congratulations, Tom!
You're one of the lucky eight percent!

167
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:40,282
- You still have tears on your cheeks.
- What the hell did she do to me?

168
00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:43,490
- Christ, I'm thirsty.
- Whaddaya mean? What eight percent?

169
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:48,203
There's only eight percent of the population
that's, like, highly hypnotisable.

170
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:50,443
Almost anybody can go under a little,...

171
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:54,446
..but not way under -
not freaky under, like he did.

172
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:57,491
- How's your hand?
- Whaddaya mean?

173
00:11:57,573 --> 00:12:02,601
I stuck a safety pin in your hand and asked
you to bleed on one side, but not the other.

174
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:06,003
- Which I can't believe you did!
- You were very cooperative.

175
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,209
It was a side of you I hadn't seen before.

176
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:10,329
- That happened?
- You said it didn't hurt.

177
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:13,769
(man #1) To hell with the pin!
I wanna know more about your Joey Luca.

178
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:15,923
- (laughter)
- (man #2) Yeah, right!

179
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:18,208
- Who?
- (man #1) Joey Luca is the kid who...

180
00:12:18,293 --> 00:12:21,046
..used to pound the shit out of you
when you were 12.

181
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:24,045
You told us all about it. You were crying.
It was hysterical!

182
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:28,092
- Shut up.
- It was very moving, Tom.

183
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:30,926
Joey Luca! Jesus Christ,
I haven't thought about him...

184
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:33,573
(sniffles)

185
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:36,524
Hey.

186
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:39,446
Can we go home? I... I feel kinda strange.

187
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:42,764
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

188
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:48,167
(exasperated sigh)

189
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:13,248
Close your eyes.

190
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:51,767
(kissing noises)

191
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:46,762
(she pants)

192
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,368
Uh!

193
00:14:49,413 --> 00:14:52,007
What's the matter?

194
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:53,492
Don't stop.

195
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:56,929
- Don't stop.
- OK.

196
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:04,129
(moans)

197
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,649
Ugh! Jesus Christ! Oh, my God!

198
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:20,691
- What?
- I-l... I'm seeing things.

199
00:15:20,773 --> 00:15:22,764
What do you mean?

200
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:26,209
Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
I-l can't right now.

201
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:30,047
- Then you were faking it extremely well.
- Ohh...

202
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:33,806
Wait. Stop, stop, stop! It's too weird.

203
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:38,011
Baby, that wasn't weird.
I could show you weird.

204
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:40,288
(sighs)

205
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,012
I felt like I was being attacked.

206
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:46,129
Thanks(!)

207
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:49,808
I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't... (nervous gasps)

208
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:52,407
I-l... I'll be right back.

209
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:14,606
What the fuck...?!

210
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:19,242
Ah... Agh... Agh!

211
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:23,246
Arghhh...

212
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,924
Argh!

213
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:35,602
- (eerie voices)
- Agh! Agh!

214
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:37,843
(distorted speech)

215
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:12,841
- Hey, Jake.
- You're awake now, Daddy.

216
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:16,844
Are you OK?

217
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,324
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

218
00:18:20,813 --> 00:18:23,122
I just don't feel so good right now.

219
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:36,885
Don't be afraid of it, Daddy.

220
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:51,723
- What was it, then? An hallucination?
- Yeah, a bunch of 'em.

221
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:56,762
It's like all these thoughts just kept coming.
You believe this? I got seven calls.

222
00:18:56,853 --> 00:19:00,004
Well, if it never happened before,
it had to be the hypnosis.

223
00:19:00,093 --> 00:19:02,846
I had this headache and I was thirsty as hell.

224
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,562
Jake! I know you're not watching
that monster tape again(!)

225
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:08,644
- (TV off)
- Who was the woman?

226
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:13,807
I don't know. Maybe somebody I was just
remembering. She didn't look familiar.

227
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:16,407
- Did you fuck her?
- You gotta be kidding.

228
00:19:16,493 --> 00:19:19,405
No. I mean, was she someone
you used to go out with?

229
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:22,724
You're jealous of my hallucination?
Hmm, you are pregnant!

230
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:26,772
- You should call Lisa.
- No, she's the one that fucked up my brain.

231
00:19:26,853 --> 00:19:29,811
- Then she has to unfuck it.
- Ooh! Agh! Fuck! Fuck!

232
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:31,884
Don't swear so much!

233
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:35,329
Hang on, hang on!
Let me get my bearings here.

234
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:40,328
I have... I have absolutely no caffeine
in my system, you know.

235
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:43,689
OK. You're asking me if I gave you a post...

236
00:19:43,773 --> 00:19:45,729
..posthypnotic suggestion.

237
00:19:45,813 --> 00:19:49,647
Did you leave anything else behind
when you were inside my brain?

238
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:52,008
- Nothing!
- Tell the truth, Lisa.

239
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:55,927
Tom! Please, this is insulting.
You know, I have done this before.

240
00:19:56,893 --> 00:19:59,487
OK, good. I-l was... I was just making sure.

241
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,643
It was just a harmless one anyway.

242
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:04,728
- What?
- Did it actually work?

243
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:07,691
- What did you say?
- I don't wanna tell you. You're grouchy.

244
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,923
Lisa, I swear to God...!

245
00:20:10,013 --> 00:20:14,529
Well, you know I've always said I think
you need to be a little more open-minded?

246
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,286
- Yeah...
- So I just said that.

247
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:21,286
''After you wake up, your mind will be
completely open, like an open door,...

248
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:23,933
..open to receive everything around you.''

249
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:27,847
- What's that supposed to do?
- Fuck if I know! I never said it before.

250
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:30,686
- Why? Did something happen?
- Jesus Christ!

251
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:34,891
Relax. OK? I opened a door, that's all.
You know, therapists do it all the time.

252
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:39,125
It releases repressed memories,
whatever you got back there.

253
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:44,207
- For you, it was probably old Mannixreruns.
- I gotta get back to work.

254
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:49,049
OK. Alrighty, then(!)

255
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:52,131
(rings)

256
00:20:52,213 --> 00:20:54,602
No! No more calls for Lisa!

257
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:58,366
- (bleeps)
- Hey, Lise, it's me.

258
00:20:58,453 --> 00:21:02,492
Call me when you wake up. Is there any way
you could baby-sit for us on Friday?

259
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:05,292
I did! I told him!

260
00:21:05,373 --> 00:21:07,603
(eerie whispering)

261
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:09,490
What's your name?

262
00:21:09,573 --> 00:21:11,211
OK.

263
00:21:11,293 --> 00:21:13,443
..but then I gotta hear about it for a month.

264
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:16,570
I called everyone who could possibly do it
and no one's free.

265
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:19,372
- Call Vanessa.
- Huh?

266
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:22,331
I said, call Vanessa and ask her about Debbie.

267
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:25,132
Anyway, call me back. Bye.

268
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:27,932
Debbie? That's the girl
who baby-sits for them?

269
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:29,082
Yep.

270
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:32,370
Oh, great idea. Pray she's free.

271
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:35,411
- How'd you know about Debbie?
- Samantha told me.

272
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:39,281
Hey, Vanessa.
Are you guys going out Friday night?

273
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:41,364
(doorbell)

274
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:44,324
Hi. I'm Debbie.

275
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:48,889
Kozak...?

276
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:53,813
Tom Witzky.

277
00:21:56,973 --> 00:21:58,964
- Hi, Debbie. I'm Maggie.
- Hi.

278
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:02,762
Thanks for coming. Jake's asleep already
and he hardly ever wakes up.

279
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:06,607
A band could play in his room
and he wouldn't hear it!

280
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:11,209
His room's upstairs, kitchen's back there.
Just help yourself if you want anything.

281
00:22:11,293 --> 00:22:13,807
Here, have a seat.
This is the baby monitor.

282
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:17,486
It's on B in his room,
so you should hear everything.

283
00:22:17,573 --> 00:22:19,609
- You wanna watch a movie?
- I got a book.

284
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:22,401
It shouldn't be later than midnight,
if that's OK.

285
00:22:22,493 --> 00:22:25,451
- Perfect.
- Great. I'll just grab my coat.

286
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:27,808
Hel-lo!

287
00:22:28,173 --> 00:22:29,845
- (sighs)
- Ready?

288
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,651
- Yeah. Just about.
- OK.

289
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:35,328
Hey. Uh... where'd you find that girl Debbie?

290
00:22:35,413 --> 00:22:40,123
Vanessa gave me her number.
Everybody uses her. It's cool.

291
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:44,001
- Another headache?
- Too much caffeine.

292
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:47,210
Oh. OK, let's go.

293
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,124
Bye.

294
00:22:55,693 --> 00:22:58,890
I think that Damon kid
is doing a great job and everything,...

295
00:22:58,973 --> 00:23:02,761
..and yeah, the kid's got a decent arm,
but high-school football is about...

296
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:07,244
..power, it's about running the goddamn
football - it always has been.

297
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,563
What did you play in high school?

298
00:23:09,653 --> 00:23:13,362
- Piano, mostly.
- Oh, Jesus! Sorry. Here, you want some?

299
00:23:13,453 --> 00:23:17,765
Anyway, Adam...
and I admit that I am biased,...

300
00:23:17,853 --> 00:23:21,528
..but my kid is having a helluva season
and it's like nobody even notices.

301
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:24,173
If they gave him the ball,
he could break a thousand yards!

302
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:26,847
And that's in an eight-game season.
Jesus Christ!

303
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:30,005
Why don't you just lick 'em
when they walk by?

304
00:23:36,573 --> 00:23:41,169
Frank says the average guy carries around
a hard-on two hours out of every day.

305
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:45,769
- Three for him.
- See, now I got a picture of that!

306
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:50,085
One of these days, she's gonna find
one of my .38s and pop a cap in my ass!

307
00:23:50,373 --> 00:23:54,332
He'll stick it in a bowl of soup
if it's still warm.

308
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:57,166
(Jake's breathing)

309
00:24:03,293 --> 00:24:05,648
Go! Go!

310
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:22,050
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

311
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:24,727
(Jake's breathing)

312
00:24:26,453 --> 00:24:29,490
Over a thousand yards,
we're talking college scholarship!

313
00:24:29,573 --> 00:24:33,122
Hey, come on...
The kid can write his own ticket.

314
00:24:33,213 --> 00:24:37,365
And that's good for everybody. It's good
for the whole goddamn neighbourhood.

315
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:40,126
He's gonna go a helluva lot further
than lever did.

316
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:45,003
Look at the quality of tail he gets. He passed
me in that department when he was 14.

317
00:24:45,093 --> 00:24:48,005
Come on! While we're young, huh?

318
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:52,250
(Jake's breathing)

319
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:55,124
(short breath)

320
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:57,681
(silence)

321
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,327
You scared me!

322
00:25:19,413 --> 00:25:21,449
(whispers) She's downstairs, I think.

323
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:28,329
(whispers) I don't know.
I haven't seen her yet.

324
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:34,764
(giggles)

325
00:25:36,693 --> 00:25:38,126
Jake?

326
00:25:39,093 --> 00:25:41,448
(whistle blows)

327
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:43,888
- What's the matter?
- Something's wrong.

328
00:25:43,973 --> 00:25:45,167
What?

329
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:56,083
(Jake) I have a secret to tell you.

330
00:25:57,693 --> 00:25:59,888
Promise, promise, promise?

331
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:11,850
Samantha says it's always dark where she is.

332
00:26:13,253 --> 00:26:15,369
Who did you say?

333
00:26:15,453 --> 00:26:17,205
Samantha.

334
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:23,810
You... you talked to Samantha?

335
00:26:23,893 --> 00:26:25,326
Yeah!

336
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:27,165
When?

337
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,244
All the time.

338
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:34,365
- Where?
- Here. In my house.

339
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,092
That's not true.

340
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:39,081
Go.

341
00:26:39,173 --> 00:26:40,162
Go!

342
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:45,409
- It isn't true.
- I don't tell lies!

343
00:26:45,493 --> 00:26:47,643
Samantha was here? Here, in your house?

344
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:50,042
- You're hurting my arm!
- Was she here?!

345
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:53,569
- Let go of me!
- Come on, you're coming with me. Let's go.

346
00:26:54,173 --> 00:26:56,892
She's taking him away.

347
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:08,649
Put me down! Put... me... down!

348
00:27:10,693 --> 00:27:12,684
(horn blares)

349
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:14,650
Tom!

350
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:26,765
Jake!

351
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,204
Jake!

352
00:27:30,013 --> 00:27:32,652
(Tom) Jake!

353
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:34,564
- What the hell...?
- She took him.

354
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,291
- What?!
- The fucking baby-sitter.

355
00:27:36,373 --> 00:27:37,931
Oh, my God!

356
00:27:38,013 --> 00:27:40,402
He's... He's not in there.

357
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:43,963
- Where are you going?
- I don't know!

358
00:28:14,853 --> 00:28:17,492
He's in there.

359
00:28:40,813 --> 00:28:42,212
- Jake!
- Daddy!

360
00:28:42,293 --> 00:28:45,251
- That's him!
- Wait! Where do you think you're going?!

361
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:48,211
Take it easy! Stop! Stop!
Take it easy. Take it easy.

362
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:51,171
- Gimme my kid.
- Tell me where she is! No!

363
00:28:51,253 --> 00:28:53,847
You tell me where she is!
You tell me where she is!

364
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:57,005
- Keep your hands off her!
- Hey! Hey, hey! Everybody shut up!

365
00:28:57,093 --> 00:29:00,449
- Are you OK?
- That girl kidnapped our son.

366
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:02,728
- Is that your child?
- Ask about Samantha.

367
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:05,885
I'm asking about the boy,
who doesn't look like he's yours!

368
00:29:05,973 --> 00:29:09,329
- I can explain this.
- I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to her.

369
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:11,404
- Is that boy your child?
- No.

370
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:13,882
She was baby-sitting for us. We never...

371
00:29:13,973 --> 00:29:17,045
What you've done is a felony.
You can go to jail for this!

372
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:20,091
- Where were you taking him?
- I wasn't taking him anywhere!

373
00:29:20,173 --> 00:29:23,085
- Then why did ya bring him here?
- I wanna press charges.

374
00:29:23,173 --> 00:29:25,641
She came here because of me.
I'm her mother.

375
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:29,772
- Her mother?
- When are you gonna ask about Samantha?

376
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:32,526
- Who?
- My oldest daughter. She ran away.

377
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:35,844
No, she was kidnapped,
and the little boy said he saw her!

378
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:39,369
We haven't heard from her in a long time.
We filed a police report.

379
00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:42,729
- Nobody returns our phone calls.
- Jake said he talked to her.

380
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:45,771
He said Samantha is in their house.
Is that her?!

381
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:48,572
- Stay away from him.
- Look at the picture.

382
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,450
- Let go of me!
- Look at the picture.

383
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:54,526
- (Maggie) This is ridiculous.
- Will you look at the picture, please?

384
00:29:57,973 --> 00:30:02,091
- I have never seen her before in my life.
- What about you?

385
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:06,284
No. I'm sorry. I've never seen her.

386
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:10,048
- No... No. No, they're lying!
- You wanna file charges?

387
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:11,407
- Yes!
- No.

388
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:15,406
- What?
- Come on, let's just, uh... forget about it.

389
00:30:15,973 --> 00:30:17,804
Let's go home.

390
00:30:17,893 --> 00:30:20,885
Are you nuts? What about
the next people she baby-sits for?

391
00:30:20,973 --> 00:30:23,123
It was her. Samantha.

392
00:30:23,213 --> 00:30:27,764
That girl in the picture,
she's the same girl I saw on our couch.

393
00:30:27,853 --> 00:30:32,165
See, why... Why did you ask that girl Debbie
to baby-sit for us? Why her?

394
00:30:32,253 --> 00:30:36,610
I couldn't find anybody else.
I was on the phone and Jake said...

395
00:30:37,613 --> 00:30:39,604
(Jake hums ''Paint It Black'')

396
00:30:39,693 --> 00:30:44,642
Jake? Do you remember the other day
when we were talking in the kitchen?

397
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:51,525
I was looking for a baby-sitter, remember?
You said Samantha told you about Debbie.

398
00:30:51,613 --> 00:30:53,683
Do you remember that?

399
00:30:55,773 --> 00:30:58,162
Mommy's asking you a question, bud.

400
00:30:59,853 --> 00:31:03,084
Is Samantha someone
who talks to you sometimes, Jake?

401
00:31:05,253 --> 00:31:09,929
- Can you remember...
- Don't ask the boy any more questions.

402
00:31:10,013 --> 00:31:12,049
(adult voice) Talk to me.

403
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:17,165
- What did you say?
- (Jake's voice) Huh?

404
00:31:18,053 --> 00:31:20,851
Jake. W-what did you say just now?

405
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:24,206
- Nothing.
- Let me hear that voice again.

406
00:31:24,293 --> 00:31:27,569
- Come on. Say it again. Use that voice again.
- Tom!

407
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:30,292
Come... Come on, Jake. Come on.
Use the voice again.

408
00:31:30,373 --> 00:31:33,206
- Tom!
- Make the voice again, Jake. You can do it.

409
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:35,011
- Tom, don't!
- How do you...

410
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,527
- Tom, please!
- It's all right! It's all right!

411
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:40,491
- OK!
- What are you doing? Hey! Hey!

412
00:31:40,573 --> 00:31:42,689
I'm talking to him!

413
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:46,685
- Hey, what's the matter with you?
- What do you think?

414
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:50,322
Well, l... I'm just trying
to have a conversation with my kid.

415
00:31:50,413 --> 00:31:53,405
A perfectly normal conversation
for a five-year-old(!)

416
00:31:53,493 --> 00:31:55,529
- Don't be afraid of it.
- Why the hell not?

417
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:58,685
I don't know. That's what he told me.

418
00:31:58,773 --> 00:32:01,207
This is where it happened.
This is where I saw her.

419
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:05,650
- You're different. You feel different.
- I leaned back and there she was. She's 18.

420
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:08,406
- Longish hair. Is that what you saw?
- I wish you...

421
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,927
- Maggie, please!
- God!

422
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:15,325
Or... or maybe you don't see her, huh?
You just hear her? Is that what it is?

423
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:18,530
- Tom, stop it!
- I need to find a way to make her come back.

424
00:32:18,613 --> 00:32:21,923
- Maybe if I hang out here long enough,...
- I'm talking to you!

425
00:32:22,013 --> 00:32:25,608
..maybe she'll come back. Maybe
you could talk to her. Help me out here.

426
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:30,050
- Hey, come on! Hey! What's the problem?
- Knock it off!

427
00:32:33,013 --> 00:32:36,608
I don't wanna talk about this
because it scares Mommy.

428
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:27,242
(~ rock music)

429
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:29,324
- Turn it up, man.
- What?

430
00:33:29,413 --> 00:33:31,608
Turn it up. Up!

431
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:33,729
(music gets louder)

432
00:33:53,173 --> 00:33:56,483
Tom is looking especially together today.

433
00:33:56,573 --> 00:33:59,645
He grunted a very pleasant greeting
at me, actually.

434
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:03,772
He's becoming sort of monosyllabic.
Nothing wrong with that guy.

435
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:06,845
Nothing a little lithium couldn't cure!

436
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:13,330
- I'm a jerk. I'm sorry.
- No...

437
00:34:15,213 --> 00:34:16,885
Are you OK?

438
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:19,487
Over there! In the door!

439
00:34:19,573 --> 00:34:23,088
(Harry) If you live on the base,
your room and board's covered.

440
00:34:23,173 --> 00:34:28,088
- (Bobby) You still gotta get up early.
- I'll retire, make a coupla down payments.

441
00:34:28,173 --> 00:34:30,971
When I take off the uniform,
I'm a landlord already.

442
00:34:31,053 --> 00:34:33,692
Five years later, I got three houses.

443
00:34:33,773 --> 00:34:35,968
- Hey. Hey, Har.
- How're ya doin'?

444
00:34:36,053 --> 00:34:39,125
Whaddaya know
about that girl Samantha Kozak?

445
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:42,046
Samantha Kozak. Why do I know that name?

446
00:34:42,133 --> 00:34:46,092
Brownish hair, 16 or 17 years old.
Used to live around here.

447
00:34:46,173 --> 00:34:48,767
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember her, I think.
- Let's go.

448
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,731
Hey, Kurt! Come here for a second.

449
00:34:51,813 --> 00:34:54,202
Like he ever tells me anything, right?

450
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:56,887
Get over here!

451
00:34:58,253 --> 00:35:00,244
Say, you know that Kozak girl?

452
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:03,211
- Uh... Debbie.
- No, no, no, the other one. Samantha.

453
00:35:03,293 --> 00:35:06,808
Oh, you mean the retard.
Yeah, she ran away.

454
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:09,726
Yeah, that's right. I remember that.
So, what about her?

455
00:35:10,053 --> 00:35:13,409
Oh, l... I just been thinking about her a lot.

456
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,006
Why?

457
00:35:17,853 --> 00:35:20,447
Her sister baby-sat for us.

458
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:25,732
Oh.

459
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:28,812
This is the first time
he's been out in a week.

460
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,487
He hasn't gone to work.
He sleeps 12 hours a night.

461
00:35:31,573 --> 00:35:36,806
He's used up all his sick days. If he doesn't
show up on Monday, they'll dock him. I...

462
00:35:38,493 --> 00:35:40,927
I can't get him more than six feet
from the couch.

463
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:44,642
- Why?
- That's where she appeared to him.

464
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:46,803
Ah.

465
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:49,202
I'm not shocked that there's another woman.

466
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:52,922
Of course, the fact that she's dead
gives one pause.

467
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:56,925
We are talking about a ghost here,
aren't we, Maggie?

468
00:35:57,013 --> 00:36:00,972
She took off, uh... last March.
With a black guy, I think.

469
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:03,931
Hey, Harry. Did she ever live in our house?

470
00:36:04,013 --> 00:36:08,131
No, no, no. I just... I just bought that one.
You're the first tenants.

471
00:36:08,573 --> 00:36:12,486
Tom and Jake, it's like they have
this private club or something.

472
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:17,044
They sit in the living room and whisper,
and, as soon as I walk in, they both shut up.

473
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:21,843
You know what you need to do? Find a
young priest with smouldering good looks...

474
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:24,288
..who can guide you through this.

475
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:26,603
I'm kidding, but I'm not.

476
00:36:26,693 --> 00:36:31,687
Look, I give Tom a lotta shit, but the truth is,
you guys are the best couple on earth.

477
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:35,891
This is on you now, Maggie. Get some help.
Find out why this is happening.

478
00:36:35,973 --> 00:36:38,089
There is a reason.

479
00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:42,644
You won't be the first woman who's
had to hold an insane family together.

480
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,088
Tom's not crazy.

481
00:36:45,173 --> 00:36:49,086
Oh, yes he is. But at least
he's getting interesting.

482
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,164
Sports flash! Sports flash!

483
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:53,403
211 yards rushing on Friday night.

484
00:36:53,493 --> 00:36:56,849
That's a total of 894 yards,
with two games to go.

485
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:59,447
The kid needs 106 yards. That's 53 a game.

486
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:02,889
He could walk through the next two games
and still break a thousand!

487
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:05,851
- Frank, what about you? Do you know her?
- Who?

488
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:08,970
Tom was asking about that Kozak girl
from over by Baldwin.

489
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:12,443
- You remember: the one who ran away?
- The retard.

490
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:14,683
Shut up, Lenny. Don't use that word.

491
00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:17,241
- He's just kinda slow.
- What? Retard?!

492
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,688
Goddammit, Lenny,
shut your fuckin' pie hole!

493
00:37:19,773 --> 00:37:21,923
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Heads up!

494
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:28,364
- What are you doing?!
- Hey, hey, hey!

495
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:34,526
Somebody's always gotta ruin it.
They can't ever just be nice.

496
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:32,127
Frank. What are you doing here?

497
00:38:34,573 --> 00:38:37,167
They're gonna kill you, Tommy.

498
00:38:39,053 --> 00:38:41,647
You and Maggie both.

499
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:58,565
Why would you
say something like that, Frank?

500
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:01,451
This is a decent neighbourhood.

501
00:39:04,653 --> 00:39:07,167
Hey, are you OK?

502
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:10,086
Where's Sheila? Is she at home?

503
00:39:13,813 --> 00:39:16,247
Listen, I'm gonna go see if Sheila's at home.

504
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,130
OK?

505
00:39:20,373 --> 00:39:24,252
- (car horn)
- In the house! Come on, both of you!

506
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,369
(dog snarls)

507
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:31,525
(police siren)

508
00:39:39,373 --> 00:39:41,762
(Adam) Come in!

509
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,168
Hi. Is your mom at home cos your dad's...

510
00:39:45,253 --> 00:39:48,165
Hey... you wanna see what I've got?

511
00:39:50,613 --> 00:39:52,922
Sure.

512
00:39:55,053 --> 00:39:57,248
That's great. Is that one of your dad's?

513
00:39:57,773 --> 00:40:00,162
Not today. Come here.

514
00:40:00,253 --> 00:40:02,892
Oh, why don't you just
put the gun away, Adam?

515
00:40:02,973 --> 00:40:06,648
- Come on, man. Come here.
- Those things make me kinda nervous.

516
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:10,692
- Then this will make you really nervous.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't do that!

517
00:40:10,773 --> 00:40:11,967
Don't!

518
00:40:12,893 --> 00:40:13,928
Argh!

519
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:38,847
Please don't be under there.

520
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:44,212
Oh, boy.

521
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:11,126
Frank?

522
00:41:11,213 --> 00:41:13,852
- (car horn)
- In the house! Come on, both of you!

523
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:16,288
(dog snarls)

524
00:41:21,693 --> 00:41:24,082
(police siren)

525
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:36,884
(barking)

526
00:41:39,973 --> 00:41:41,804
(gunshot)

527
00:41:42,893 --> 00:41:44,292
Adam!

528
00:41:44,373 --> 00:41:46,568
Adam! Open the door!

529
00:41:47,253 --> 00:41:49,687
Oh, my God. Oh, God!

530
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:05,124
Help!

531
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:09,328
Help!

532
00:42:09,413 --> 00:42:11,847
Am I awake... or asleep?

533
00:42:11,933 --> 00:42:13,924
Help!

534
00:42:19,693 --> 00:42:22,287
(Sheila) Oh, my God! Oh, my God, my baby!

535
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,126
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Let me... Let me go!

536
00:42:25,213 --> 00:42:29,968
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- (Frank) Is he alive? Is he alive?

537
00:42:30,053 --> 00:42:34,410
Oh, my God, Adam!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

538
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:40,046
Adam! Adam!

539
00:42:45,053 --> 00:42:48,125
I'm gonna take him for a walk or something.

540
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:52,569
- Come on, sweetie pie. Let's get your jacket.
- Where are we going?

541
00:43:00,973 --> 00:43:02,964
(Maggie) Ha-ha!

542
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:12,365
- Well! Hello, there!
- Well, hello... there.

543
00:43:12,453 --> 00:43:15,013
(~ bagpipes)

544
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,084
Listen! Music!

545
00:43:17,173 --> 00:43:19,243
It's beautiful!

546
00:43:22,053 --> 00:43:24,123
Hey! Jake, wait up!

547
00:43:25,293 --> 00:43:27,887
(~ ''New World Symphony'' by Dvorak)

548
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:13,571
I don't think we're supposed to be here,
sweetie. Come on, let's go. This way.

549
00:44:21,253 --> 00:44:23,767
Whoa! This place is cool!

550
00:44:44,013 --> 00:44:47,005
Come on, honey. Let's go get some lunch.

551
00:44:55,053 --> 00:44:57,203
Mom! What's this thing?

552
00:44:57,293 --> 00:45:00,968
- I don't know. Let me take a look.
- It looks like some kinda stone.

553
00:45:01,053 --> 00:45:04,045
- Either that, or it's a medal.
- Yeah, I think it is.

554
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:07,125
- ''Served in the...''
- Look. A flag.

555
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:13,288
- Everything OK?
- It's fine. Just fine.

556
00:45:14,093 --> 00:45:17,403
- We're not supposed to be here?
- Hm?

557
00:45:17,493 --> 00:45:21,202
- Oh, no. It's fine. Really.
- Oh.

558
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:24,765
OK. See you later.

559
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:27,287
The boy's got the eyes on him, doesn't he?

560
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,009
X-ray.

561
00:45:35,573 --> 00:45:38,167
Not you, though.

562
00:45:38,573 --> 00:45:41,007
Possibly Daddy?

563
00:45:42,013 --> 00:45:44,243
They're not the only ones.

564
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:48,326
Tell Daddy to come by and see me
a little later tonight.

565
00:45:48,933 --> 00:45:51,527
He might learn a few things.

566
00:45:59,133 --> 00:46:01,124
Bye, Jake.

567
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:06,012
Bye, Neil.

568
00:46:11,693 --> 00:46:14,127
His name is Neil.

569
00:46:37,053 --> 00:46:39,044
(plucks string)

570
00:46:42,853 --> 00:46:44,844
(plucks string)

571
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:47,401
Try that, Daddy.

572
00:46:53,573 --> 00:46:55,564
Why do I know that song?

573
00:46:55,653 --> 00:46:57,769
I'll be home right after the movie.

574
00:46:57,853 --> 00:47:00,367
I know it. I know it!

575
00:47:00,453 --> 00:47:02,728
I said, I won't be late.

576
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,608
OK.

577
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:12,207
Bye, Mom. Bye, Maggie.

578
00:47:51,253 --> 00:47:53,403
Oh, hello.

579
00:47:53,493 --> 00:47:56,530
I don't know if I'm in the right place.
I'm looking for Neil.

580
00:47:56,613 --> 00:47:58,808
- (speaks Korean)
- Excuse me? I...

581
00:47:58,893 --> 00:48:01,009
- (speaks Korean)
- I'm sorry...

582
00:48:01,093 --> 00:48:03,288
(speaks Korean)

583
00:48:16,733 --> 00:48:18,405
Shit!

584
00:48:18,493 --> 00:48:21,485
(softly) Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

585
00:48:28,293 --> 00:48:30,807
(knocks on door)

586
00:48:37,173 --> 00:48:39,687
I wanna see Neil.

587
00:48:42,173 --> 00:48:44,687
Wait here.

588
00:48:45,693 --> 00:48:48,207
I don't know her.

589
00:48:50,213 --> 00:48:54,525
What are you doing?
I said the boy's father. I said tell him to come.

590
00:48:54,613 --> 00:48:59,403
He'd never do it. He'd kill me if he knew I was
talking to you about this. He's so paranoid.

591
00:48:59,493 --> 00:49:02,610
What's the story, man?
Close the fucking door!

592
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:06,402
- So are they. I can't let you in.
- Who are they?

593
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:09,929
Look, man, this ain't no freak show in here!
Close the damn door!

594
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,322
Look, you just gotta get outta here.

595
00:49:12,413 --> 00:49:14,563
My husband is losing his mind.

596
00:49:14,653 --> 00:49:16,883
I don't know why, but I think you do.

597
00:49:16,973 --> 00:49:21,524
You can tell me what you know, but you can't
tell me to go away because I'm not moving.

598
00:49:27,773 --> 00:49:30,207
- How long has he had it?
- Just a few days.

599
00:49:30,293 --> 00:49:33,126
- What happened? A car wreck?
- No.

600
00:49:33,213 --> 00:49:35,329
- A child die?
- No!

601
00:49:35,413 --> 00:49:38,086
- Did he kill someone?
- He was hypnotised.

602
00:49:38,173 --> 00:49:41,563
- Is that what started it?
- It comes and it goes.

603
00:49:41,653 --> 00:49:46,090
Some people have it for five seconds.
Some, their whole lives.

604
00:49:46,173 --> 00:49:48,767
He's a receiver now. Everything's coming in.

605
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:53,210
He can't stop it. He can't slow it down.
He can't even figure it out.

606
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:58,003
It's like he's in a tunnel with a flashlight,
but the light only comes on once in a while.

607
00:49:58,093 --> 00:50:01,369
He gets a glimpse of something,
but not enough to know what it is.

608
00:50:01,453 --> 00:50:03,444
Just enough to know it's there.

609
00:50:03,773 --> 00:50:05,968
- Jake, too.
- Your son?

610
00:50:06,213 --> 00:50:08,169
Much better flashlight.

611
00:50:08,653 --> 00:50:13,124
- Does he know what it wants yet?
- What who wants?

612
00:50:13,213 --> 00:50:16,842
He saw a ghost, didn't he?
What did it ask him to do?

613
00:50:16,933 --> 00:50:20,403
- She didn't ask anything.
- Maybe he wasn't listening.

614
00:50:20,493 --> 00:50:23,610
She's asked for something,
and now she's waiting,...

615
00:50:23,693 --> 00:50:27,447
..getting more and more pissed off
that he's not doing it.

616
00:50:27,533 --> 00:50:30,923
If he doesn't do her thing,
she'll never go away.

617
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:34,610
(voice on TV)

618
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:37,402
Agh!

619
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:40,405
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

620
00:50:41,613 --> 00:50:42,648
Agh!

621
00:50:56,013 --> 00:50:58,004
Agh!

622
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:09,283
- (screaming on TV)
- Hey!

623
00:51:09,773 --> 00:51:12,924
- Absolutely not!
- Oh, please, please, please!

624
00:51:13,013 --> 00:51:18,610
- Five more minutes. Five more minutes.
- No, zero minutes. Oh, this is cool.

625
00:51:18,693 --> 00:51:21,924
- ''The Mummy'' gives you nightmares.
- No fair!

626
00:51:22,013 --> 00:51:25,130
I know. I'm gonna take a bath.
Are you OK for ten minutes?

627
00:51:25,213 --> 00:51:27,522
Whatever!

628
00:51:47,093 --> 00:51:49,084
How do I know this song?

629
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:53,132
I know I know this song. I know it. I know it.

630
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:08,601
Agh! Freezing!

631
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:11,888
Round up your weapons, folks!

632
00:52:11,973 --> 00:52:15,409
- Charge!
- (~jolly music)

633
00:52:22,253 --> 00:52:25,051
I don't wanna talk right now.

634
00:52:26,653 --> 00:52:28,132
Hey!

635
00:52:32,933 --> 00:52:34,810
~ Rabbit, rabbit,
rabbit, rabbit, rabbit

636
00:52:34,893 --> 00:52:37,168
~ Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit

637
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:40,006
(hums)

638
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:42,084
No, no...

639
00:52:49,763 --> 00:52:54,393
Tom? I think the pilot blew out
on the water heater again.

640
00:52:54,483 --> 00:52:57,043
Can you go light it for me?

641
00:52:58,243 --> 00:53:00,438
Hello?!

642
00:53:01,963 --> 00:53:04,602
Or I could go light it.

643
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:32,472
(TV)

644
00:53:32,563 --> 00:53:34,121
Thanks, Colonel.

645
00:53:34,203 --> 00:53:36,159
(bloodcurdling scream)

646
00:53:36,443 --> 00:53:39,037
I said no!

647
00:53:41,723 --> 00:53:44,237
(humming)

648
00:53:53,843 --> 00:53:55,834
Ah, bummer!

649
00:53:55,923 --> 00:53:58,517
(winces in pain)

650
00:54:00,923 --> 00:54:01,912
Agh!

651
00:54:02,003 --> 00:54:04,801
- Hey! That is the most amazing...
- (TV distortion)

652
00:54:04,883 --> 00:54:07,113
(moaning)

653
00:54:43,963 --> 00:54:45,954
Oh!

654
00:55:04,163 --> 00:55:06,677
Agh!

655
00:55:06,763 --> 00:55:07,752
Ow!

656
00:55:50,483 --> 00:55:52,713
Arghh!

657
00:55:58,443 --> 00:55:59,671
Tom?

658
00:55:59,963 --> 00:56:02,523
Tom! Breathe!

659
00:56:02,603 --> 00:56:03,592
Ohhh!

660
00:56:03,683 --> 00:56:06,595
- Ugh!
- What happened?

661
00:56:06,683 --> 00:56:08,116
- She's there.
- What?

662
00:56:08,203 --> 00:56:10,194
She's there.

663
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,274
(eerie moaning)

664
00:56:14,843 --> 00:56:17,311
What?

665
00:56:17,723 --> 00:56:20,396
(Maggie) Oh, my God!

666
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,556
(hammering on door)

667
00:56:31,203 --> 00:56:35,594
I... I want you to hypnotise me again.
All this shit - I want it out, I want it gone.

668
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:39,835
- I want it all to stop. Right now!
- Come right in. I want you to meet Clarita.

669
00:56:39,923 --> 00:56:41,675
Oh. Hi. Sorry.

670
00:56:41,763 --> 00:56:43,913
Sorry, l...

671
00:56:44,003 --> 00:56:46,471
Look, do you think that you could...?

672
00:56:46,563 --> 00:56:48,872
- Could she...?
- Yeah...

673
00:56:48,963 --> 00:56:54,959
Clarita, perdóname. Mi cuñado está
un poco loco. ¿Nos dejas solas, por favor?

674
00:56:55,043 --> 00:56:57,716
- ¿Ahora?
- Sí. Sí.

675
00:56:57,803 --> 00:57:02,081
¡Fantástico! En medio de la noche
me tengo que parar en medio de la calle...

676
00:57:02,163 --> 00:57:05,997
- ..en este barrio de mierda a buscar un taxi.
- I know. I...

677
00:57:06,963 --> 00:57:09,113
- Well, gracias.
- De nada.

678
00:57:09,203 --> 00:57:10,522
(door slams)

679
00:57:10,763 --> 00:57:13,596
OK, you gotta, uh... slow down. OK?

680
00:57:13,683 --> 00:57:17,801
You gotta be a little patient with me here
cos I got a confession to make.

681
00:57:17,883 --> 00:57:22,240
Y'see, we... we just smoked this great big
fatty a few minutes before you walked in,...

682
00:57:22,323 --> 00:57:26,601
- ..so this is blowing my mind a bit extra.
- Listen to me. Listen to me!

683
00:57:26,683 --> 00:57:32,360
- Yeah?
- Whatever... door you opened in my brain,...

684
00:57:32,443 --> 00:57:34,513
..l want you to shut it.

685
00:57:34,603 --> 00:57:36,480
- Now!
- OK.

686
00:57:36,563 --> 00:57:38,679
I'll do it. OK. I can do that.

687
00:57:39,363 --> 00:57:41,593
Close your eyes.

688
00:57:41,683 --> 00:57:47,201
OK. Just like last time,
I want you to just focus and concentrate.

689
00:57:48,443 --> 00:57:54,154
Listen to the sounds of the room,
listen to the sounds of your breathing.

690
00:57:54,243 --> 00:57:57,872
Look at the back of your eyelids.
Do you see anything there?

691
00:57:57,963 --> 00:58:01,353
- Could you just get to it, please?
- All right. All right.

692
00:58:02,003 --> 00:58:05,359
I want you to pretend
you're back in the movie theatre.

693
00:58:05,443 --> 00:58:07,479
It's very dark,...

694
00:58:07,563 --> 00:58:12,000
..and in the whole pitch-black theatre, the
only thing you can see is the white screen.

695
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:16,395
As you focus on the screen,
you begin to drift closer to it in your chair.

696
00:58:16,483 --> 00:58:20,840
You'll notice that there are letters
on the screen - tall, thick, black letters.

697
00:58:20,923 --> 00:58:24,074
But they're out of focus,
so you begin to drift closer to them.

698
00:58:24,163 --> 00:58:27,599
- (gasps) Someone's here.
- No, it's empty.

699
00:58:28,203 --> 00:58:30,319
(Tom) But there's someone else in here.

700
00:58:30,403 --> 00:58:33,759
- No, you're alone in the theatre, Tom.
- No. No, I'm not.

701
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:38,359
- (Lisa) Your feet and your ankles are relaxed.
- (Tom) No. Hard to breathe.

702
00:58:38,443 --> 00:58:42,595
(Lisa) Your hands are limp and heavy.
Your... your arms...

703
00:58:42,683 --> 00:58:45,959
- (Tom) No air! No air!
- Tom, I want you to look at the screen.

704
00:58:46,043 --> 00:58:47,635
Look at the screen.

705
00:58:47,723 --> 00:58:49,475
Hey.

706
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:54,314
You can read the letters now.
You're right up next to them.

707
00:58:54,923 --> 00:58:57,153
Tom! Look at the screen!

708
00:58:58,603 --> 00:59:00,594
No!

709
00:59:01,683 --> 00:59:05,471
Wow! What... what happened? Are you OK?

710
00:59:05,563 --> 00:59:08,919
You need to sit down. What was happening
there was very next level.

711
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,915
You should have seen your face.
D'you want a beer?

712
00:59:12,003 --> 00:59:14,437
Are you feeling better? What happened?

713
00:59:16,243 --> 00:59:18,234
I'm supposed to dig.

714
00:59:29,043 --> 00:59:31,034
Hi!

715
00:59:37,043 --> 00:59:38,635
Hello?!

716
00:59:41,523 --> 00:59:43,957
Anybody home?

717
00:59:46,723 --> 00:59:49,715
Wow! Look what I'm not cleaning up.

718
01:00:02,363 --> 01:00:04,354
Interesting!

719
01:00:16,963 --> 01:00:19,557
(digging)

720
01:00:21,003 --> 01:00:23,597
(sighs) OK!

721
01:00:24,603 --> 01:00:27,197
(Tom grunts)

722
01:00:30,963 --> 01:00:34,160
Hi, honey. What you doin'?

723
01:00:34,243 --> 01:00:37,235
Dad said I'm supposed to dig.

724
01:00:37,323 --> 01:00:39,314
Oh.

725
01:00:42,443 --> 01:00:44,832
Nice(!)

726
01:00:47,083 --> 01:00:49,074
Tom.

727
01:00:50,163 --> 01:00:53,235
- Tom!
- Oh!

728
01:00:53,323 --> 01:00:56,520
- You scared me.
- I scared you?

729
01:00:57,603 --> 01:01:01,232
- What are you doing?
- I'm supposed to dig.

730
01:01:01,323 --> 01:01:03,917
- Whaddaya mean?
- I'm supposed to dig.

731
01:01:04,003 --> 01:01:05,994
Who says?

732
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:08,074
(panting)

733
01:01:08,843 --> 01:01:11,641
I see. And what's Jake doing?

734
01:01:14,483 --> 01:01:17,122
Jake... is helping.

735
01:01:20,363 --> 01:01:23,241
- Why are you doing this?
- The water softens up the dirt.

736
01:01:23,323 --> 01:01:26,121
No. I mean...

737
01:01:26,203 --> 01:01:29,081
Could you just stop for a second?

738
01:01:29,163 --> 01:01:34,681
- Tom! Can you turn around and look at me?
- What... exactly don't you understand?

739
01:01:34,763 --> 01:01:36,833
I'm supposed to dig.

740
01:01:37,123 --> 01:01:40,115
- Why are you digging?
- I'm searching.

741
01:01:40,203 --> 01:01:43,161
- What are you searching for?
- The question is not what.

742
01:01:43,243 --> 01:01:46,599
We both know very well what,
even though we don't wanna admit it.

743
01:01:46,683 --> 01:01:53,156
The question, Maggie, which you can
plainly see I am very busy trying to answer...

744
01:01:53,243 --> 01:01:55,837
The question is where.

745
01:01:57,563 --> 01:01:59,554
Don't worry, he's OK.

746
01:02:00,043 --> 01:02:03,752
- (whispers) It's not over there.
- We're calling the police.

747
01:02:04,563 --> 01:02:07,316
And tell them what, exactly? Huh?

748
01:02:07,643 --> 01:02:11,921
Practise it! Run it by me once.
I wanna see how it sounds out loud.

749
01:02:14,723 --> 01:02:16,714
Anything else?

750
01:02:19,443 --> 01:02:21,638
Tom, why don't you come inside with me?

751
01:02:21,723 --> 01:02:24,396
I wanna talk to you.
You're not yourself right now.

752
01:02:25,003 --> 01:02:27,278
This is just fucking typical!

753
01:02:27,363 --> 01:02:29,593
Now, what do you want me to do,
Maggie, huh?

754
01:02:30,003 --> 01:02:34,076
You want me to go inside and just, uh...
sit down on the couch in front of the TV...

755
01:02:34,163 --> 01:02:39,840
..and drink beer until I fall asleep, and maybe
repeat the whole thing again tomorrow?

756
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,232
- Be quiet!
- And the day after and the day after?

757
01:02:42,323 --> 01:02:45,042
- (Maggie) Oh, just stop!
- Until... until...

758
01:02:45,123 --> 01:02:48,035
Until l... I grab my chest and die?

759
01:02:48,123 --> 01:02:52,355
I mean, this... this is the most important thing
that's ever happened to me.

760
01:02:52,443 --> 01:02:56,482
I mean, this is...
this is the most... important thing...

761
01:02:56,563 --> 01:03:00,522
..that I have ever done in my whole life,
in my whole stupid life!

762
01:03:00,603 --> 01:03:02,594
And you want me to just stop?!

763
01:03:04,123 --> 01:03:06,637
No! No, I won't stop!

764
01:03:06,723 --> 01:03:09,032
I won't stop! I won't stop!

765
01:03:11,123 --> 01:03:13,717
Eight years, I've known you.

766
01:03:13,803 --> 01:03:17,637
Not once have you talked to me like this.
Not once.

767
01:03:17,723 --> 01:03:21,432
And if you do it again, I swear to God...

768
01:03:22,443 --> 01:03:27,995
And you know what? When you talk about
how ordinary you are and your stupid life,...

769
01:03:28,083 --> 01:03:32,793
..you're saying ''Our stupid life,''
which I don't think is particularly stupid.

770
01:03:32,883 --> 01:03:36,558
So how the fuck
am I supposed to feel about that?

771
01:04:29,163 --> 01:04:31,438
Are you gonna drink that?

772
01:04:43,283 --> 01:04:44,921
I'm sorry.

773
01:04:47,163 --> 01:04:49,393
OK, I'm not sorry.

774
01:04:56,003 --> 01:04:58,517
- Who's that from?
- My brother Steve.

775
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:02,278
- My grandma's going back in the hospital.
- No, she...

776
01:05:03,283 --> 01:05:04,682
What?

777
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,482
What?

778
01:05:09,803 --> 01:05:11,441
Nothing.

779
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:14,472
(phone rings)

780
01:05:20,963 --> 01:05:23,113
What is it?

781
01:05:30,523 --> 01:05:32,002
Hello?

782
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:36,122
Oh, Steve. I'm sorry, we've been so busy.
I was just about...

783
01:05:36,203 --> 01:05:38,194
What?

784
01:05:42,083 --> 01:05:44,517
She did?

785
01:05:45,363 --> 01:05:47,354
How am I doing, Dad?

786
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,276
You're doing great, kid. You're doing great.

787
01:05:55,683 --> 01:05:58,072
I'm so sorry, baby.

788
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:02,839
You knew.

789
01:06:02,923 --> 01:06:04,914
You knew, didn't you?

790
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,437
When is the funeral?

791
01:06:07,523 --> 01:06:11,482
Sunday. We should leave as soon as we can.

792
01:06:11,563 --> 01:06:13,554
Oh.

793
01:06:13,643 --> 01:06:16,032
You... you want me to go with you?

794
01:06:17,603 --> 01:06:20,197
I just thought,
with your family and everything...

795
01:06:20,283 --> 01:06:24,071
Do I want you to go with me...
to my grandmother's funeral?

796
01:06:24,163 --> 01:06:27,155
She practically raised me!
Of course I want you to come.

797
01:06:27,243 --> 01:06:31,521
It's just, I'm kinda
in the middle of something here.

798
01:06:34,763 --> 01:06:37,323
(glass cracks)

799
01:07:10,563 --> 01:07:13,157
(frustrated grunts)

800
01:07:36,563 --> 01:07:40,033
$800 a month! Can't get any fucking water!

801
01:07:40,123 --> 01:07:42,114
Fuck!

802
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,872
(pipes groan)

803
01:08:42,483 --> 01:08:44,872
(banging)

804
01:08:54,243 --> 01:08:56,234
(grunting)

805
01:09:02,683 --> 01:09:05,072
(frustrated yell)

806
01:09:08,563 --> 01:09:10,440
Tools.

807
01:09:41,403 --> 01:09:43,394
(groans)

808
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:45,201
Damn!

809
01:09:45,283 --> 01:09:47,274
Piece of shit!

810
01:09:56,963 --> 01:09:59,557
(machine hums)

811
01:10:24,123 --> 01:10:27,115
Haa-ha-ha-ha!

812
01:10:27,763 --> 01:10:28,752
Yaaaaa!

813
01:10:28,843 --> 01:10:31,641
(yelling and drilling)

814
01:10:39,363 --> 01:10:41,354
It's a rented house!

815
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:52,472
(thunder)

816
01:10:53,803 --> 01:10:55,794
(phone rings)

817
01:10:57,123 --> 01:10:58,875
- (Tom) Hello?
- (Maggie) It's me.

818
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:01,955
- Oh, hey. Hey, baby, how're ya doin'?
- I'm OK.

819
01:11:02,043 --> 01:11:06,002
- How's your family?
- Drunk, fighting with each other.

820
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:10,395
Listen, Maggie, I'm so sorry. I mean, I...
I should be there with ya. I'm an asshole.

821
01:11:10,483 --> 01:11:13,122
Yeah, well, you have your good points.

822
01:11:13,203 --> 01:11:16,912
- How do you feel?
- Oh, fine. Fine. You know...

823
01:11:17,003 --> 01:11:20,712
Much... much... much better.
Everything's fine here. Really good.

824
01:11:20,803 --> 01:11:23,875
No, uh...

825
01:11:24,643 --> 01:11:28,841
- No more digging?
- No. Uh-uh. Back to normal.

826
01:11:28,923 --> 01:11:33,633
I'm sorry, too. I wish I hadn't stormed out.
I shouldn't have left you alone.

827
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:35,793
I deserved it.

828
01:11:35,883 --> 01:11:39,558
Why don't you come up here with us?
You could make it in an hour.

829
01:11:39,643 --> 01:11:42,601
- Oh, no, I can't really do that.
- Why not?

830
01:11:42,683 --> 01:11:45,641
I'm not supposed to use the truck
for personal trips.

831
01:11:45,723 --> 01:11:51,161
- I'll pick you up. I'll leave right away.
- Oh, no, no, baby. Don't do that. That's crazy.

832
01:11:51,243 --> 01:11:53,074
- (growls)
- I gotta go.

833
01:11:53,163 --> 01:11:56,041
- I'll just pull up front and honk. Bye.
- No, no, no! No!

834
01:11:57,323 --> 01:11:59,314
(sighs)

835
01:12:02,843 --> 01:12:05,232
(thunder)

836
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:30,362
(aggressive grunting)

837
01:12:34,003 --> 01:12:36,119
OK, bub, you ready to go?

838
01:12:36,203 --> 01:12:39,195
I'm scared to go home.
I wanna stay at Uncle Steve's house.

839
01:12:39,283 --> 01:12:43,674
- Why are you scared?
- Because of the feathers.

840
01:12:43,963 --> 01:12:46,158
What feathers?

841
01:12:46,243 --> 01:12:48,837
I don't know. I just saw feathers.

842
01:12:50,563 --> 01:12:52,952
It's OK. I'll watch him.

843
01:12:53,043 --> 01:12:55,352
OK. You be good.

844
01:12:55,443 --> 01:12:57,638
Mom! Wait!

845
01:12:59,043 --> 01:13:01,238
You forgot this.

846
01:13:01,323 --> 01:13:03,712
(heavy rain)

847
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:08,312
(thunderclap)

848
01:15:15,243 --> 01:15:17,438
(Adam) Hi!

849
01:15:18,443 --> 01:15:20,081
Hi.

850
01:15:20,163 --> 01:15:22,597
Come here a sec.

851
01:15:22,683 --> 01:15:26,722
- What?
- Come closer. I can't hear you.

852
01:15:28,643 --> 01:15:32,522
- Are you talking to me?
- I wanna show you something.

853
01:15:32,603 --> 01:15:34,594
You wanna show me something?

854
01:15:34,683 --> 01:15:37,675
Well, yeah. I don't see anybody else around.

855
01:15:38,683 --> 01:15:41,561
- What is it?
- It's a surprise.

856
01:15:41,643 --> 01:15:45,921
It's really great. Come on!
You won't believe it.

857
01:15:46,003 --> 01:15:48,153
Come on! It's freezing!

858
01:15:53,963 --> 01:15:55,954
Hey! Happy St Patrick's Day!

859
01:15:56,043 --> 01:15:58,762
- What's the surprise?
- (chuckles) Don't you have it?

860
01:15:58,843 --> 01:16:01,676
- Oh, yeah. The surprise, huh?
- The surprise.

861
01:16:01,763 --> 01:16:04,197
- You need another drink.
- No, I got the spins.

862
01:16:04,283 --> 01:16:06,274
Drink, motherfucker, drink!

863
01:16:06,363 --> 01:16:10,276
- I don't think there is a surprise.
- Oh, yeah, there is. Yeah, there is.

864
01:16:10,363 --> 01:16:12,957
The surprise is we decided
we wanna be your friends.

865
01:16:13,043 --> 01:16:14,715
- You do?
- (Kurt) Yeah.

866
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:19,194
- Why do you wanna be my friends now?
- Are you kidding? Look at yourself.

867
01:16:21,163 --> 01:16:23,631
Uh-uh, look.

868
01:16:23,723 --> 01:16:26,362
You can take your coat off, you know.

869
01:16:27,043 --> 01:16:29,682
- You want a drink?
- I'm not supposed to.

870
01:16:29,763 --> 01:16:33,676
Don't you do anything
you're not supposed to? Huh?

871
01:16:33,763 --> 01:16:35,958
I do.

872
01:16:37,803 --> 01:16:39,202
Yeah.

873
01:16:39,283 --> 01:16:41,672
Momma, you are hot!

874
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:44,914
Come on, let's be friends, huh?

875
01:16:45,003 --> 01:16:47,198
Well,...

876
01:16:47,283 --> 01:16:49,922
..you can kiss me if you want to.

877
01:16:50,003 --> 01:16:52,392
Yeah... Yeah.

878
01:17:00,563 --> 01:17:03,919
- Not... not like that, OK?
- OK. OK. OK...

879
01:17:08,763 --> 01:17:10,958
Agh! Ouch!

880
01:17:13,203 --> 01:17:17,719
- I wanna go home.
- Not now, no, no. Come on...

881
01:17:17,803 --> 01:17:19,794
- I'll be your friend.
- I want to, but...

882
01:17:19,883 --> 01:17:23,558
Just be nice to me, huh? Be a good girl.
You are a good girl, aren't you?

883
01:17:23,643 --> 01:17:26,476
- I have to go home.
- How about a helmet wash?

884
01:17:26,563 --> 01:17:29,236
I have to go home. I have to go home!

885
01:17:30,883 --> 01:17:33,078
(screams)

886
01:17:33,763 --> 01:17:35,754
(retches)

887
01:17:35,843 --> 01:17:38,516
(hysterical screaming)

888
01:17:38,603 --> 01:17:40,912
No! Stop!

889
01:17:42,843 --> 01:17:45,311
Shut up! Shut up!

890
01:17:45,403 --> 01:17:47,394
Shut... Argh! God!

891
01:17:47,483 --> 01:17:50,475
Shut up! Argh!

892
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:54,762
Make her stop, man!
Make her stop screaming!

893
01:17:54,843 --> 01:17:56,196
Shut her up, man!

894
01:17:56,283 --> 01:17:58,956
(~ ''Paint It Black'' by Gob)

895
01:18:00,003 --> 01:18:02,563
Use your jacket or something!
Put it over her face!

896
01:18:03,723 --> 01:18:05,122
Shut up!

897
01:18:05,203 --> 01:18:07,922
(muffled screaming)

898
01:18:08,003 --> 01:18:11,075
(gasps for breath)

899
01:18:14,083 --> 01:18:19,521
~ I could not foresee
this thing happening to me

900
01:18:19,603 --> 01:18:22,401
(Jake hums the tune)

901
01:18:27,523 --> 01:18:29,957
Oh, my God!

902
01:18:30,963 --> 01:18:32,954
What the fuck did you do that for?

903
01:18:33,043 --> 01:18:35,034
- Is she dead?
- No shit, she's dead!

904
01:18:35,123 --> 01:18:37,512
Oh, my God!

905
01:18:37,603 --> 01:18:40,720
- Look at her tongue, man.
- I am not here.

906
01:18:40,803 --> 01:18:43,158
I've never seen nobody dead before.

907
01:18:43,243 --> 01:18:45,757
- I can't be here.
- It's fucking gross.

908
01:18:45,843 --> 01:18:48,277
This isn't happening.

909
01:18:48,363 --> 01:18:52,436
Fucking plastic over her face!
Good thinking, Adam(!)

910
01:18:53,443 --> 01:18:56,162
Well, what do we do now?

911
01:19:30,043 --> 01:19:32,477
How's he doin'?

912
01:19:32,563 --> 01:19:36,033
He might make it. He might not.

913
01:19:37,043 --> 01:19:40,877
Sheila's over at the hospital.
I'm gonna head over.

914
01:19:40,963 --> 01:19:43,193
Frank... I'm sorry.

915
01:19:44,203 --> 01:19:49,596
I'm sorry because...
I think I know why Adam shot himself.

916
01:19:50,163 --> 01:19:53,439
And... I gotta call the police about it.

917
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:57,083
And I don't want you to hear it from them.

918
01:19:57,163 --> 01:20:00,360
And I don't want Sheila
to read about it in the paper.

919
01:20:00,443 --> 01:20:04,641
I-l... I think you have a right to know
before anybody else.

920
01:20:04,723 --> 01:20:06,873
What are you talking about, Tom?

921
01:20:09,603 --> 01:20:11,992
Come with me.

922
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:14,677
Wait here for a second.

923
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:24,481
It better be important.

924
01:20:35,403 --> 01:20:37,917
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

925
01:20:40,843 --> 01:20:42,993
(Frank) How the hell did you find this?

926
01:20:43,563 --> 01:20:45,918
Does it matter?

927
01:20:46,923 --> 01:20:49,437
Well, you don't know if it was Kurt and Adam.

928
01:20:50,363 --> 01:20:52,194
Yeah, I do.

929
01:20:53,563 --> 01:20:55,997
But you don't have anything to...

930
01:20:57,003 --> 01:21:02,361
Tom, you're talking like a goddamn lunatic!
That's what people are gonna say.

931
01:21:02,443 --> 01:21:05,241
I-it's just a body. It doesn't prove anything.

932
01:21:06,003 --> 01:21:07,482
She's...

933
01:21:07,563 --> 01:21:10,635
She's got somebody's hair in her hand.

934
01:21:11,643 --> 01:21:14,635
They're gonna be able to tell whose it is.

935
01:21:18,243 --> 01:21:20,518
Hey, Frank.

936
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:25,722
We... we gotta call the cops.

937
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:31,114
What were we supposed to do?

938
01:21:31,603 --> 01:21:34,117
It was an accident.

939
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:39,519
The kids come to us, she's already dead.

940
01:21:40,723 --> 01:21:45,160
The damage is done. There's nothing
anybody can do to bring her back.

941
01:21:46,563 --> 01:21:51,239
But these kids got...
everything ahead of them.

942
01:21:52,483 --> 01:21:55,236
So what were we supposed to do, Tom?

943
01:21:55,323 --> 01:21:59,475
Send our sons to jail for the rest of their lives
because of her?

944
01:22:00,483 --> 01:22:02,838
Who are you planning to shoot with that?

945
01:22:04,323 --> 01:22:08,157
- Get the hell outta here, Tom.
- Hey, Frank... come on upstairs.

946
01:22:08,243 --> 01:22:10,199
We... we could talk about this.

947
01:22:10,283 --> 01:22:13,514
I've been living with this for... six months.

948
01:22:16,683 --> 01:22:19,481
Six fucking months!

949
01:22:21,163 --> 01:22:26,317
Do you think anything you have to say is
gonna make one bit of difference to me?!

950
01:22:27,363 --> 01:22:30,400
- Get the hell outta here!
- I-I'm not leaving until...

951
01:22:30,483 --> 01:22:31,598
Get out!

952
01:22:32,683 --> 01:22:34,833
Get out!

953
01:22:36,283 --> 01:22:39,195
(gunshot)

954
01:22:39,283 --> 01:22:42,480
(hammering on door)

955
01:22:45,363 --> 01:22:48,992
- Hi.
- Hi. (clears throat) Hi.

956
01:22:49,283 --> 01:22:53,879
- Well, it's really pouring, huh?
- Yeah, looks like it.

957
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:57,520
You got a minute?

958
01:22:57,603 --> 01:23:00,071
No, I'm... I'm... kinda busy right now.

959
01:23:00,163 --> 01:23:02,074
It's important.

960
01:23:07,003 --> 01:23:10,552
I-l don't really
have time to talk right now, Harry.

961
01:23:10,643 --> 01:23:13,237
Ah, Jesus! This rain, huh?!

962
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:18,122
(Tom) Harry, like I said, you know,
I'm really kind of busy right now.

963
01:23:18,203 --> 01:23:21,400
Kurt, I know you weren't raised in a barn.
Close that door.

964
01:23:21,483 --> 01:23:24,043
Maybe I could call you later or something?

965
01:23:27,203 --> 01:23:29,717
Tom, we got ourselves
a serious problem here.

966
01:23:29,803 --> 01:23:32,795
Whaddaya mean?

967
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:35,477
What the hell you think
you're doing to my house?

968
01:23:35,963 --> 01:23:39,000
I heard all this pounding going on.
I thought I'd check it out.

969
01:23:39,083 --> 01:23:41,597
I didn't think you'd be wrecking the place!

970
01:23:42,123 --> 01:23:44,557
What's the matter with you?

971
01:23:44,643 --> 01:23:48,158
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take care of that.

972
01:23:48,243 --> 01:23:51,679
I-l was trying to fix your water main,
you know - it was leaking,...

973
01:23:51,763 --> 01:23:54,800
..and I couldn't get to it
from underneath the house.

974
01:23:56,083 --> 01:24:00,759
I-I mean... I-l couldn't
get under the house to get to it.

975
01:24:01,843 --> 01:24:04,311
Is that right?

976
01:24:05,363 --> 01:24:08,002
Damn. A lotta water damage?

977
01:24:08,723 --> 01:24:11,237
Some.

978
01:24:11,323 --> 01:24:13,518
Can I look around?

979
01:24:14,963 --> 01:24:18,751
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sure. Help yourself.

980
01:24:20,363 --> 01:24:22,593
Maybe you'd better show me where it's at.

981
01:24:25,203 --> 01:24:28,991
Well, you guys'll be able to see.
I-l gotta take off right now.

982
01:24:31,203 --> 01:24:34,161
I'm almost afraid to look.

983
01:24:34,243 --> 01:24:35,915
- Drink it.
- Right.

984
01:24:36,003 --> 01:24:38,312
Hurry up.

985
01:24:39,523 --> 01:24:42,595
The water main doesn't run under the house.

986
01:24:45,603 --> 01:24:47,719
Well, I know that now.

987
01:24:49,283 --> 01:24:52,480
Shit, Tom.

988
01:24:58,523 --> 01:25:00,559
Argh!

989
01:25:02,203 --> 01:25:04,956
(Harry) Get him on the rug.

990
01:25:10,283 --> 01:25:12,672
- Don't look at him. Roll him over.
- Yeah.

991
01:25:12,763 --> 01:25:15,357
(Harry) Let's go! All right,...

992
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,638
..get outta the way.

993
01:25:18,243 --> 01:25:20,882
(repeated beeps of car horn)

994
01:25:53,443 --> 01:25:55,877
(glass smashing)

995
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:56,074
Tom?

996
01:26:57,963 --> 01:27:00,318
(flicks light switch)

997
01:27:00,403 --> 01:27:02,837
Are you here?

998
01:27:07,643 --> 01:27:09,235
(flicks light switch)

999
01:27:09,323 --> 01:27:11,314
Shit!

1000
01:27:12,763 --> 01:27:14,321
Argh!

1001
01:27:16,963 --> 01:27:19,796
- (Harry) Out of the way, Kurt!
- (gunshot)

1002
01:27:21,563 --> 01:27:22,518
Arghh!

1003
01:27:42,643 --> 01:27:47,194
They were gonna kill you, Tommy.
You and Maggie both.

1004
01:27:53,043 --> 01:27:56,433
- (softly) Are you OK?
- (softly) Yeah.

1005
01:27:58,563 --> 01:28:01,361
(Maggie sobs)

1006
01:28:08,083 --> 01:28:10,756
Cold-blooded murder.

1007
01:28:12,163 --> 01:28:14,996
I can't let something like that happen.

1008
01:28:16,003 --> 01:28:18,278
Not here.

1009
01:28:19,283 --> 01:28:22,241
This was a decent neighbourhood.

1010
01:28:26,243 --> 01:28:29,235
(~ ''It's Not The Spotlight'' by Beth Orton)

1011
01:28:33,923 --> 01:28:37,711
~ If I ever feel the light again

1012
01:28:38,523 --> 01:28:41,481
~ Shining down on me

1013
01:28:42,883 --> 01:28:45,716
~ I don't have to tell you

1014
01:28:46,563 --> 01:28:49,555
~ How welcome it would be

1015
01:28:50,603 --> 01:28:53,037
~ I felt the light before

1016
01:28:53,123 --> 01:28:56,354
~ But I let it slip away

1017
01:28:57,763 --> 01:29:04,999
~ And I just keep on believing
that it'll come back some day

1018
01:29:05,483 --> 01:29:07,838
~ It's not the spotlight

1019
01:29:09,643 --> 01:29:12,077
~ It's not the candlelight

1020
01:29:13,923 --> 01:29:16,153
~ It's not the streetlights

1021
01:29:16,883 --> 01:29:19,761
~ Just some old street of dreams

1022
01:29:22,403 --> 01:29:24,997
~ It ain't the moonlight

1023
01:29:26,123 --> 01:29:29,035
~ Not even the sunlight

1024
01:29:31,203 --> 01:29:39,360
~ But I've seen it shining in your eyes
and you know what I mean

1025
01:29:54,083 --> 01:29:56,995
(eerie whispering)

1026
01:30:13,243 --> 01:30:15,234
(female voice) Jake...

1027
01:30:16,323 --> 01:30:18,314
Jake...

1028
01:30:18,403 --> 01:30:20,997
(voices grow louder)

1029
01:30:22,243 --> 01:30:24,120
Jake...

1030
01:30:24,963 --> 01:30:27,318

(~ ''Hello'' by Poe)

1032
01:30:30,163 --> 01:30:32,154
~ Hello, hello

1033
01:30:39,963 --> 01:30:41,954
~ Hello, hello, hello

1034
01:30:45,003 --> 01:30:47,517
~ Are you out there?

1035
01:30:48,243 --> 01:30:50,040
~ Oh

1036
01:30:50,123 --> 01:30:52,114
~ Oh-oh

1037
01:31:00,563 --> 01:31:02,554
~ La-da-da, da-da-da

1038
01:31:02,963 --> 01:31:05,431
~ La-da-da, da-da-da

1039

~ MOD, are you out there?

1041
01:31:14,163 --> 01:31:16,313
~ I can't see your face but you left a trace

1042
01:31:16,403 --> 01:31:20,157
~ On a data back-road that I almost erased

1043
01:31:21,483 --> 01:31:25,192
~ Not even God takes this long to get back

1044
01:31:26,203 --> 01:31:28,194
~ So get back

1045
01:31:29,163 --> 01:31:32,633
~ Cos I hit a fork in the road,
I lost my way home

1046
01:31:32,723 --> 01:31:37,035
~ Cut off from the main line
like a disconnected modem

1047
01:31:38,723 --> 01:31:40,714
~ Hello?

1048
01:31:41,883 --> 01:31:44,875
~ Tap in the code, I'll reach you below

1049
01:31:45,803 --> 01:31:49,432
~ No one should brave
that underworld alone

1050
01:31:49,523 --> 01:31:51,514
~ Hello, hello, hello

1051
01:31:54,203 --> 01:31:56,763
~ How do I reach you?

1052
01:31:57,603 --> 01:31:59,400
~ Oh

1053
01:31:59,483 --> 01:32:01,474
~ Oh-oh

1054
01:32:10,083 --> 01:32:12,074
~ La-da-da, da-da-da

1055
01:32:12,483 --> 01:32:14,758
~ La-da-da, da-da-da

1056
01:32:14,843 --> 01:32:16,834
~ Oh

1057
01:32:17,443 --> 01:32:19,752
~ Oh

1058
01:32:19,843 --> 01:32:22,038
~ La-da-da, da-da-da

1059
01:32:22,323 --> 01:32:24,712
~ La-da-da, da-da-da

1060
01:32:24,803 --> 01:32:26,794
~ Oh

1061
01:32:27,323 --> 01:32:29,314
~ Oh

1062
01:32:29,403 --> 01:32:31,598
~ Word has it on the wire

1063
01:32:31,683 --> 01:32:33,958
~ That you don't know who you are

1064
01:32:34,043 --> 01:32:38,912
~ Well, if you could jack into my brain,
you'd know exactly what you mean here

1065
01:32:39,603 --> 01:32:43,198
~ Mothers are trails on stars in the night

1066
01:32:44,603 --> 01:32:47,959
~ Fathers are black holes
that suck up the light

1067
01:32:49,523 --> 01:32:51,912
~ That's the memory I filed on the fringe

1068
01:32:52,003 --> 01:32:55,313
~ Along with the memory
of the pain you lived in

1069
01:32:56,803 --> 01:32:58,794
~ Hello

1070
01:32:59,403 --> 01:33:03,237
~ I don't have the password,
but the path is chain-linked

1071
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:07,991
~ So if you got the time, set the tone to sync

1072
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:09,277
~ Tap in the code

1073

~ Hello, hello

~ Oh

~ Oh-oh

1077
01:33:29,283 --> 01:33:31,274
~ La-da-da, da-da-da

1078
01:33:31,763 --> 01:33:33,754
