00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,996
(Screaming) Josh!

3
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:47,380
I'm Kurt Loderwith MTV news.
The film is The Blair Witch Project.

4
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,008
One of the scariest films
of all time...

5
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,011
I was terrified.
Oh, it scared me to death...

6
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,222
It all started with light heart
and the there documentary filmmakers...

7
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,351
...armed with a 16mm camera
and a video camcorder...

8
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,936
...head into the Black Hills forests
of Maryland...

9
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,356
...to make a movie
about a legendary witch...

10
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,691
...and they're never heard from again.

11
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,819
There's no doubt about of the box-office
success on The Blair Witch Project.

12
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,947
What's not clear
is whether the legend is true.

13
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,533
So far the fans are not only flocking
to the multiplex...

14
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,411
...they are flowing the little town
Burkittsville, Maryland.

15
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,248
People have started coming
to Burkittsville...

16
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,919
...as if itwere Charles Manson's
The Spahn Ranch...

17
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:30,674
...or Ed Gein the serial Killer's house,
to visit a haunted place.

18
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,967
"Burkittsville isn't a haunted place. "

19
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,887
"It's a place that a fictional movie
was set in. "

20
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,555
I wasn't able to see the movie...

21
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,474
...when it came out, because I was...

22
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,351
...in the hospital.

23
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,728
But as soon as they let me out...

24
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,065
I was at the movie theatre
seventeen times in a row.

25
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,360
The web-site sold me.
The web-site, you know...

26
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,071
...has all these police photos...

27
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,949
...and official police things...

28
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,200
...all this information...

29
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,535
...you really believe it.

30
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,870
Our stick men sold so well
on the internet...

31
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,289
...that we started selling them
in the yard.

32
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,958
Ant then somebody came by to buy them...

33
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,334
...and they wanted rocks.

34
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,712
So we got rocks
out of my rock garden...

35
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,881
...but I didn't want to get rid of them
so he offered me $10...

36
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,175
...after he started booting it up more.

37
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,303
His wife really wanted them,
so we sold them to him.

38
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,556
We sold some on the internet
but not many.

39
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,516
It costs too much to ship a rock.

40
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,770
Everybody that comes is like this.
I'm so used to being on video.

41
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,648
I make sure, if I go to my car,
or to get the paper...

42
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,776
...that I at least have full makeup on,
and a great night-gown.

43
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,654
I wish that they'd used
a fictitious town...

44
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,032
...and possibly thought ahead...

45
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,285
...toward what type
of repercussions could come...

46
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,996
...from using the word documentary...

47
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,416
...in their advertising,
and on their web-site.

48
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,919
Get out of these woods, and go home!

49
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:54,299
There was no goddamn Blair Witch!

50
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:58,428
You know, there are a lot of
naysayers who come and say nay...

51
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,474
...but then there is supporters who
come up to my town, come up to me.

52
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,602
They run up to me, they stop...
Hey, Selena!

53
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,522
They come over to me, they hug me,
and say, "Dude, I know it's real. "...

54
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,692
...and they squeeze me, and I say,
"I know it's real, too"...

55
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,819
...and we have a bond.

56
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:19,074
I say, "I know, and they go, I know, man,"
and I go, "I know"...

57
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,473
(Screaming)

58
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,354
You think you're a wise ass?

59
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,690
I didn't do anything wrong!

60
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,817
(Yelling)

61
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,381
Enough!

62
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,075
(Music fades)

63
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,378
They found blood in the van.

64
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,009
(Woman) Could you turn that down?

65
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,805
(Man) I'm just trying to set the mood
for the mission.

66
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,391
That's sweet,
but I feel like I'm gonna toss.

67
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,770
She's been feeling queasy.
No need to explain.

68
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,938
Your comfort is my concern.

69
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,650
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for Stephen Ryan Parker,

70
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,029
who has three names,
so he must be from Boston.

71
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:30,158
Apparently he's here researching
a book with his girlfriend.

72
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,536
The book's title is...
Blair Witch History Or Hysteria.

73
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,122
Hysteria Or History.

74
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,668
Why is it you guys can't get on
the same page about the witch?

75
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,878
We've always been misunderstood.

76
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,839
We embrace nature, not evil.

77
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,675
Thank you, Erica.

78
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,884
(Erica laughing)

79
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,137
Not only a hottie, but a real witch!

80
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,931
Blessed be.

81
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,893
Wiccan... Wicc it good. (Laughing)

82
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,479
(Stephen) Wait,
why are we slowing down?

83
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,692
This is where your other tour mate
wants to meet. She's a little weird.

84
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,027
She thinks she's psychic
or some shit.

85
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,364
When did you last talk to her?
E- mail, two days ago.

86
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,701
Are you sure she'll be here?
Yeah.

87
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,911
Kim!
Kim?

88
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,287
Yo.

89
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,040
Is that her?

90
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,959
Kim?

91
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,087
Yeah.
I'm Jeff.

92
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,256
I figured.

93
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:30,427
What are you doing there?
Trying to find the energy.

94
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,554
Inside the grave?

95
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,141
To stand up. I'm exhausted.
I've been on the road two days.

96
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,852
Want a hand?
I want amphetamines.

97
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,105
Weed is what I've got,
beer I'm gonna get.

98
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,232
Both - now.

99
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,663
(Jeff) That's right, friends.

100
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,915
For two luxurious days and nights,

101
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:05,628
my friends, you will walk the same
path the witch herself once walked,

102
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:10,175
sleep on the same soil where
her victims' blood was spilled.

103
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,512
Possibly losing your own souls
in the process.

104
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:18,266
I want to thank you all
for coming on the inaugural tour

105
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,393
of the Blair Witch-Hunt.

106
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,812
Inaugural?
You've never done this?

107
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,982
Never.
That's not what your web-site said.

108
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,110
"Over 10,000 satisfied customers. "

109
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,237
No, that's my web-store.

110
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,823
Stick men, t-shirts,
official Blair dirt.

111
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,492
Tours?

112
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,411
We're all virgins on this bus!

113
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:58,014
Here? You drove by a huge Safeway
two miles back.

114
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:02,644
That was in Burkittsville. I don't
shop there. I don't even piss there.

115
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,732
(Kim) Hell of a town you got here.

116
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,776
What century are they living in?

117
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,237
The gene pool's
a little shallow here.

118
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,074
Dive in,
you'll crack your skull open.

119
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,953
(Jeff) Ok.

120
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,040
Where are we going first?
The ruins of Rustin Parr's house.

121
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,712
(Erica) That guy who heard
the voices to kill, right?

122
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,590
(Jeff) Yeah, seven little kids.
(Kim) I hear voices all the time.

123
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,011
(Cracking)

124
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,848
Do we need all this shit
for a walk in the woods?

125
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,726
The Blair Witch-Hunt
provides all amenities

126
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,688
while you risk certain death
and dismemberment.

127
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,983
Give it up.
What's with all this camera stuff?

128
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,152
To record all occult phenomena

129
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,530
that may manifest itself
in the course of the tour.

130
00:10:55,613 --> 00:11:00,160
Damn, you're really running
Bullshit Central, aren't you?

131
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:04,122
If you don't believe in the witch,
why the hell did you bother to come?

132
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,750
I thought the movie was cool.

133
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,960
How much further?

134
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,713
Couple more miles.
Jesus!

135
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:15,925
So how far along are you?
What do you mean?

136
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,011
The baby. How many weeks?

137
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,306
Six.
You don't want to keep it, do you?

138
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,932
No.

139
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:27,103
But Stephen wants the baby.
Yes. How do you know?

140
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,730
I don't know.

141
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,150
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.

142
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,950
(Jeff) Welcome to the Parr ruins,
ladies and gentlemen.

143
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:44,579
It's supposed to be
where they found Heather's footage.

144
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,374
(Tristen) These markings
are incredible.

145
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,876
(Erica) Ancient witches' alphabet.

146
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,420
(Stephen) Looks like recent graffiti.

147
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,924
(Tristen) They're so realistic.
It's a little scary.

148
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,843
Actually, some of these symbols
are positive.

149
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,056
Only those who don't understand
witchcraft would be afraid of them.

150
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,599
And remember, fear...

151
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,976
is the forerunner of failure.

152
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,396
Ok.

153
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,774
What's the story with this tree?

154
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,567
What tree?

155
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,361
Look behind you.

156
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,908
(Jeff) Where the fuck
did this come from?

157
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,785
This was never here before.

158
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,912
Nice try, dude.

159
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,997
What does that mean?

160
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,251
Maybe you should drop the tree bit
from your next tour.

161
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,253
No, no, I'm not making this up.

162
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,921
I need a beer.
Me, too.

163
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:39,134
Hey, geniuses, explain to me
why a house built in 1826

164
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,760
was built around a tree.

165
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:45,015
This would have been sticking
straight through the living room.

166
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,308
Jeff, nobody's scared.

167
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,158
(Screaming)

168
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:10,290
(Erica) Evil intent in the ground,
may a release soon be found.

169
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,960
In peace, release the energy
that be from my magic.

170
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,713
Are you casting
some kind of evil spell?

171
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,924
Widdershins - Reversing the evil.

172
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,427
The first law of wicca
is "Harm none".

173
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,889
Cos whatever you do
is going to come back threefold.

174
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,432
The karma's a bitch.

175
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,770
What are you really doing?
Communing with Elly Kedward.

176
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,732
The Blair Witch? I thought you
embraced nature, not evil.

177
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,985
You don't understand.
Elly... was a good witch.

178
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,946
She was an earth child, like me.

179
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,783
She's gonna be my mentor.

180
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,452
You've spoken with her?
Not yet...

181
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,621
but I will.

182
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,414
That's why I'm here.

183
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,919
To shed my mortal coil...

184
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,004
and commune with Elly.

185
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:01,216
(Tristen) Have you ever seen
her picture?

186
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,259
I don't think there are any.

187
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,137
Stephen and I found one.
Check it out.

188
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:12,310
We think it was drawn
before they banished her from Blair.

189
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,520
Banished, my ass.

190
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,773
They dragged her into the woods
in the middle of winter,

191
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,983
and tied her
to a fucking tree to die.

192
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:23,113
You make her sound helpless. Can't
witches summon powerful energy?

193
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,991
We can...
but we still have to eat, shit,

194
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,077
and die like the rest of you.

195
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,871
We just look good doing it.

196
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,383
Why do you need all these cameras?

197
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,928
I'm personally hoping for
an Elly Kedward sighting.

198
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,597
I've got a big beta
for a quality master.

199
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,018
I got a night vision, an infrared,
a cute little mini dv,

200
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,853
handhelds for everyone...

201
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,981
and this baby can even do
frame-a-second time lapse.

202
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,276
If anything comes in for a visit,
we're gonna catch it.

203
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,945
May I have permission
to take this leaf?

204
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,489
Thank you.

205
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,411
(Erica) Evil intent in the ground,
may your release soon be found.

206
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:15,373
And peace release the energy
that be from my magic.

207
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,583
So mote it be.

208
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,003
Evil intent in the ground,
may your release soon be found.

209
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,340
And peace release the energy
that be from my magic.

210
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,924
So mote it be.

211
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,137
Ok, wait... How many Heather Donahues
does it take

212
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,722
to screw in a light bulb?

213
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,766
How many?
Just one!

214
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,893
(Laughter)
Just one of them!

215
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,938
Do you know
what I could never figure out?

216
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:42,359
What's that?
Blair Witch Project, Ok?

217
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:46,821
Two guys and a girl, sleeping
in the same tent night after night,

218
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,448
and no sex?

219
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,950
It makes no sense.
You're so right.

220
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,620
I mean, they were scared
out of their minds,

221
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:57,582
and the greatest stress reliever
right at their fingertips...

222
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,709
and nothing.

223
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,170
I'm a little stressed.

224
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,048
Try some more weed.

225
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,051
Ok.

226
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,262
The Bermuda Triangle.

227
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:16,643
It's a place in the world
that's been created by hysteria...

228
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:21,648
...by people's own psychology,
by their own ideas of the place.

229
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,192
We were already
a persecuted minority.

230
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,237
This whole Blair Witch thing
set us back 300 years.

231
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,657
We're back in the burning times.
It fucked up our image.

232
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,953
Erica, people fear what they don't
understand. You must realise that.

233
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:39,457
No shit. People think that I drink
blood, that I sacrifice children...

234
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,752
...that I worship the devil
just because I'm a wiccan.

235
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,089
Where I come from, people think
because I dress in black,

236
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,675
I'm some kind of sick killer
or something.

237
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:52,345
I don't even believe in the devil.
Ok?

238
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,224
That's a Christian concept.
I believe in nature.

239
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,226
I hate nature.

240
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,437
Myth, for me... right?

241
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,397
...is just myth.

242
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,986
It's not history, it's not metaphor
and it's definitely not the truth...

243
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,530
Stephen, stories like this happen...

244
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,657
...because they exist
in a place of truth...

245
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,702
...because there's historical evidence,
there's fact.

246
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,620
That's what you don't understand.

247
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,372
(Jeff) I want to make a film.

248
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,876
Wicca... A Way Of Life.

249
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,544
Nice.
Yeah.

250
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,713
Wait, wait... Check this out.

251
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,052
Look at everyone.

252
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:36,931
Everyone is obsessed
with the Blair Witch

253
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,434
for their own reasons, including us.

254
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:42,687
Goth... A Way Of Life.

255
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,856
A documentary on you.

256
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,442
All real, all video.

257
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,653
Video never lies, Kim.

258
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,530
Film does, though.

259
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,075
Everyone wants to see something.

260
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,494
I'm telling you,
hysteria and delusions,

261
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,829
they breed in situations like this.

262
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,208
Why are you applying rational thought
to mythology?

263
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:08,296
Because if people believe something
enough, isn't it real?

264
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,965
Perception is reality.

265
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,884
You're not listening to me.

266
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,513
Babe, I know what you're saying,
I just think it's bullshit.

267
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:20,225
I think you're being
a monomaniacal reductionist.

268
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,815
(Eerie shrieking)

269
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,608
What the hell was that?

270
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,070
I heard that, too.

271
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,540
Burkittsville's funniest home videos!

272
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,084
You scared the shit out of me, man!

273
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,795
It answered every single one
of your wet dreams.

274
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,630
What are you guys doing here?

275
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,133
We've got a tour group,
the Blair Witch Walk.

276
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,928
What's your excuse?
Tour group, the Blair Witch-Hunt.

277
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:01,266
You're supposed to look out for stuff
like this. This is so not happening!

278
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,727
We have jurisdiction.
We have permits.

279
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,854
Yeah? From Cravens? Let me see 'em.

280
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,897
They're in the car.
Bullshit!

281
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,776
Let's put it this way, one of us
is staying - it's us or you,

282
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,403
and it looks like us, bitch!

283
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,655
It's gonna come back at you
threefold.

284
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,323
What?
In the wiccan...

285
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,450
Shut up!

286
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,119
Your balls will fall off
in three days.

287
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,872
Yo, guys, guys,
I think I can settle this.

288
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,708
Just give us till dawn,
then we're out of here.

289
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:31,463
We're cold, we're tired...
and we're a little shook up.

290
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:34,632
We saw something
up at Coffin Rock today.

291
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:38,803
Yeah... Yeah, up at Coffin Rock.
It scared the shit out of us.

292
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:42,349
Guys, stop talking about it,
because I'm gonna freak.

293
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,351
I just want to go home.

294
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,936
Can we see this thing...

295
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,398
Coffin Rock?
Blair Witch? Go to Coffin Rock.

296
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,700
It's your money, Greta.

297
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,203
Next time,
take the Blair Witch Walk.

298
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:07,582
Next time, take the Blair Witch-Hunt.
Here's my card. Call. I'm on the web.

299
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,378
(Giggling)

300
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,923
They were never seen again.

301
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,509
Their footage
was found a year later...

302
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,969
underexposed, and useless.

303
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,516
I don't trust that these assholes
aren't coming back.

304
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,061
They're going to be pissed
that we took the foundation.

305
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,605
I don't think it's anything
to worry about.

306
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:34,359
Besides...
We're gonna be up all night, baby!

307
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,111
(Howling)

308
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,487
Giddy-up!

309
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,990
We'll just keep our eyes open.

310
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,784
They're not coming back.

311
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,911
Why do you think that?

312
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,789
I just do.

313
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,584
(Kim) I'll be back in a minute.

314
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:54,379
Up all night!

315
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,881
How do your parents feel...

316
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,801
about having a witch for a daughter?

317
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:05,390
My father is an Episcopal minister,
in a one-church-town

318
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:08,476
back in Munnsville, Illinois.

319
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,396
Yeah.

320
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,773
That's a bummer.

321
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,568
How many beers is that for you?

322
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,780
I'm serious!
You're drinking like a fish.

323
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,491
I just think you should
take care of yourself.

324
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:28,121
Jesus! We've already gone
through this once today already.

325
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,649
(Man screaming)

326
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,609
(Girl panting)

327
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:38,752
(Baby crying)

328
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:08,907
What's going on?

329
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:26,383
What the fuck...?

330
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,098
This is my work.

331
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,558
This is all my research.

332
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,602
Our work.

333
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:39,020
Every word.

334
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:41,106
Where the fuck are my cameras?

335
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:44,943
(Stephen) This is all
of our goddamn work!

336
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:47,612
How the hell are we gonna make
the deadline?

337
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:51,825
We backed it up on computer.
No, Tristen, that was just notes.

338
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,369
Half this shit is original documents.

339
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,329
Where the hell was everybody?

340
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,581
We were all supposed to be awake.

341
00:24:58,665 --> 00:24:59,916
Guys, where's Erica?

342
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:01,960
I'm right here.

343
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:06,172
We must have fallen asleep.

344
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:09,134
Asleep? It's like
we must have blacked out!

345
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,970
The last thing I remember
was that other group.

346
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:16,683
Yeah... those fucking dickweeds!
Who else could it have been, huh?

347
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,894
They came back from Coffin Rock,
and ripped us off!

348
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:23,606
Ripped? These things look like
they were bit off.

349
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:27,235
I- I-I... What am I gonna do?

350
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,241
At least the tapes are still here.

351
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:38,913
What?
The tapes. They're here.

352
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,832
Where? Do you see them?

353
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,625
In my mind, I see them.

354
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,172
Oh, Jesus.

355
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:49,966
You fuck.

356
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:53,511
They're there!

357
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,769
Where they found
the Blair Witch tapes?

358
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:02,437
You've got to be kidding me.

359
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,273
Come on! Why would they be in there?

360
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:08,943
Newsflash, everybody...
That was just a movie.

361
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:11,821
I don't know why, Stephen.

362
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,412
They're under the rocks.

363
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,401
There's nothing in there.

364
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:50,777
Reach inside.

365
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,699
Well...?
I don't feel so hot.

366
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:59,035
Jeff, is there anything in there?

367
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,416
(Erica) Jesus Christ.

368
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:09,212
How did those get in there?

369
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,339
Are they yours?

370
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,010
I think we should leave.

371
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,053
How did you know?

372
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,514
I don't know.
Are they yours?

373
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,433
Did you put them there? Did you?!

374
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:24,644
Jeff, are they your tapes?
Yeah, they're my tapes!

375
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:26,646
Then, why are they still here?

376
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:31,151
Why is the equipment trashed, the
cameras are gone, but not the tapes?

377
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:35,238
She's right. Wouldn't those guys
want to fuck up your tour footage?

378
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,532
Stephen, I want to leave.

379
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:38,908
How did this happen?

380
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,622
Oh, fuck!

381
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:46,374
Jesus Christ, the baby.

382
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,465
We found blood in the van.

383
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,636
Tristen had a miscarriage.

384
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,390
You know that, Cravens.

385
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,810
"She bled in the van
on the way to the hospital. "

386
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:11,816
This girl's hypothermic.
Get me heating blankets and a lamp.

387
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,611
It's like she's
been sitting in ice water.

388
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,488
We were just camping.

389
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:20,325
(Cravens) "The doctor thinks
it's hypothermia. "

390
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:23,703
Course, the way I see it
you brought her out here,

391
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,830
you took her into those woods.

392
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,500
She's your responsibility.

393
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,585
Are you charging me with something?

394
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:37,133
You have been... a pain in this town's ass
since you were 10.

395
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:43,181
You need to learn
to stay out of trouble, boy.

396
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:45,558
It makes you defensive...

397
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,852
Anxious.

398
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:51,648
Last thing you need
is to end up back in the loony bin.

399
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,172
How is she?

400
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:20,427
She lost the baby.

401
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:26,182
The doctor will keep you here
till your temperature stabilises.

402
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:29,728
You lost a lot of blood.
More than usual.

403
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,646
It's for the best.

404
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,816
Your body is telling you
something was wrong.

405
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,652
Something was wrong.

406
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,078
(Screaming)

407
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,797
How are you feeling?

408
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,594
I'm not staying here.

409
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:07,640
Five hours of our lives
are unaccounted for.

410
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,852
I want to see those tapes.
I want to know what happened.

411
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:13,938
I've got some editing equipment at my
house.

412
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:17,108
We should be able to come up
with some answers.

413
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:20,153
We're still in
the Black Hills, aren't we?

414
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:21,654
Yeah, right up there.

415
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:27,077
Let's get Tristen inside.
We can take care of the bags later.

416
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:31,206
I thought we were going
to your house.

417
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:33,792
RFD 431... Jericho Mills, home.

418
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,710
(Stephen) What did it used to be?

419
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:37,629
It was a factory after the war.

420
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:41,341
They were going to destroy it, so I
got them to sell it to me for a buck.

421
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:42,676
(Erica) Cool.

422
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,887
Sorry about the bridge.
It's the only way in or out.

423
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,140
It's pretty safe...
don't lean on the railings.

424
00:30:57,315 --> 00:31:00,193
I am not a gambling man.

425
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:02,445
But...

426
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:06,950
I would bet my entire...

427
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:09,994
retirement pension...

428
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:13,540
that the blood in the van...

429
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:17,335
is gonna match those tourists.

430
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,881
You've been looking to pin something
on me since I was a kid.

431
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,299
(Dogs barking)

432
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:27,554
Come on, get in, quick. Before they
eat you. Quick, quick. Let's go.

433
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:30,473
(Barking)

434
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:31,725
(Barking stops)

435
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:33,059
(Barking)

436
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,937
Burkitt County's cheapest alarm.

437
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,440
And what's that do? Squirt water?

438
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:42,569
No, that actually works. Wave.
It's recording you right now.

439
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:45,196
I got 'em hooked up
through the building.

440
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,657
I'm a little paranoid.
Hah! a little?

441
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,659
I heard that.

442
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,536
But with good reason.

443
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,330
I got a lot of valuable stuff here.

444
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:56,916
Oh, my God!

445
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,462
(Kim) Yeah! You wouldn't want
somebody to come in here...

446
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:03,298
...and steal stuff
that you've already stolen.

447
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:06,968
Where it comes from is not
my business, nor should it be yours.

448
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:09,846
I just like to pass the savings
on to others.

449
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:12,640
Really? And how do you do that?
E- bay.

450
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:16,561
Buying, selling, trading, swapping.
I'm a major player.

451
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:19,397
I thought all your cameras
got trashed.

452
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:21,566
Well, you can never have too many.

453
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:26,446
Jeff, I think we've had enough
videotaping for one weekend.

454
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,156
Yeah, dude. Tour's over.

455
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:30,450
(Jeff) Maybe the tour has just begun...

456
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:33,620
...cos you're walking into
the official Blair store.

457
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:36,414
Come in, everybody.
This is where it begins.

458
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:39,709
This is the epicentre of
the Blair Witch-Hunt web-site.

459
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:44,089
I got my sticks... You can touch
these, they're for the stick men.

460
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:46,633
Don't touch those, those are drying.

461
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:49,511
Did you collect these
in the Black hills?

462
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:50,762
Yeah, every twig.

463
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:53,515
Here is a rock...
Oh, my God, who made that?!

464
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:54,808
Oh, I did, earlier.

465
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:59,229
We've got Parr ruins foundation dirt,
that's a big item. I sell that.

466
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:02,148
T- shirts and sweat shirts, and hats.

467
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:05,026
Here you go, Tristen.
That's for you, gratis.

468
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,945
I feel better.

469
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:11,449
You're as big an asshole
as the rest of them.

470
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,577
What are you talking about, Erica?
This stuff is hot.

471
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:17,038
This is what
the wiccan religion needs,

472
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:19,457
more capitalism based on
fear and lies.

473
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:23,670
Do you really think it's fair
to exploit our culture,

474
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:26,798
just to sell stick-figure key chains?

475
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:32,178
I think this place is cool, Jeff.
Thanks.

476
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:34,806
Jeff, we're tired.
I should get her to bed.

477
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:36,474
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

478
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,810
Let's see...

479
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:41,980
The stairs by the kitchen
lead to my editing loft.

480
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,940
The bedroom on the right is mine.

481
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:47,569
It's got the biggest bed
and it's own john. You guys take it.

482
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,779
Thanks, brother.
Sure.

483
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:51,531
Sleep well.

484
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:54,576
The rest of the bedrooms
are down the hallway.

485
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:55,785
Hey...

486
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,665
I really appreciate the hospitality,
but take me off your mailing list.

487
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:02,083
Ok.

488
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:07,547
They should have never let you out.
You're a long way from sane.

489
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,309
(Tristen) I saw something
at the hospital.

490
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:22,103
What?

491
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,233
It was just like the picture
in the Blair Witch black bible.

492
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,403
The same clothes,
that same face, like...

493
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:33,823
...she'd been drowned.

494
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:35,241
Who?

495
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:37,160
The little girl.

496
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,288
Eileen Treacle.

497
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:42,374
Sweetie...

498
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:45,919
Why don't we talk about this
after you get some sleep?

499
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:47,712
I want to talk about it now.

500
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:50,298
You need to sleep. You're in shock.

501
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:55,679
This is so... intense.

502
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:59,933
Chill out, Erica.
We've watched half of one tape.

503
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:02,977
We've got four angles,
we've got our handhelds,

504
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:05,855
we've got hours of tapes
we haven't seen.

505
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:09,651
Last night, when we were camping,

506
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:14,823
I dreamt I hurt the baby.

507
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:27,419
That's just because we've been
fighting about it so much.

508
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:33,341
You've been through a lot.
I know how much you wanted a baby.

509
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:35,677
I'm sorry I didn't want it.

510
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:40,557
I'm sorry that I lost it.

511
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:44,477
Guys, something just occurred to me.

512
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,023
Where's that tree?
(Kim) What?

513
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:52,068
That big tree that was right there.
Now there's just this tiny twig.

514
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:55,613
See, guys, I told you there was
something up with that tree.

515
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:59,951
Hand me another of those dv cassettes
maybe there's another angle.

516
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:03,079
Whoa, whoa... what is up with that?

517
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:07,834
I don't know. I think it's chafing
from the backpack.

518
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,002
Does it hurt?

519
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:11,254
Not really. It just kind of itches.

520
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:13,631
It's nothing. Here.

521
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:19,346
What was that?
What?

522
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:20,889
Rewind it.

523
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:22,390
What did you see?

524
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:25,060
I'm not sure. A flash, or something.

525
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:28,897
Coffin Rock.

526
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,358
What?
Coffin Rock.

527
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:37,697
How the hell do you see Coffin Rock?
Can you see in other dimensions?

528
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:40,200
I don't know.
That's what it reminds me of.

529
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:43,119
Those guys
that were murdered there in 1886...

530
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:46,289
...after they were gutted,
their heads were arranged...

531
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:49,167
...in the shape of a pentagram...
Like that.

532
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:52,754
A great American pastime -
blame it on a witch.

533
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:55,715
(Jeff) Let me see
if I can get that image back.

534
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:57,175
(Tristen) Stephen!

535
00:36:58,176 --> 00:37:00,261
(Erica) Is she gonna be Ok?

536
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:02,222
I don't know.

537
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,556
Stephen!

538
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:06,935
Tristen?

539
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:18,029
Tristen?

540
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:27,997
(Sobbing outside)

541
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:51,855
(Barking alarm)

542
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,189
Shut up.

543
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:57,402
(Girl's voice) "You brought it back
with you. "

544
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,280
(Shriek)

545
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,129
(Tristen) What was all that?

546
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:19,674
That was Jeff's stupid dog alarm.

547
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:23,428
The crying.

548
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:28,141
You heard that, too?

549
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:31,394
In my dreams.

550
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:34,773
I thought I was having
this horrible nightmare.

551
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,734
About what?

552
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:44,115
Children...

553
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:48,411
looking up my skirt

554
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:51,331
as I twirled round and round.

555
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,044
So I hurt them.

556
00:38:57,962 --> 00:39:00,340
Stephen, what the hell
is wrong with me?

557
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:03,760
Nothing. Nothing. You're just...

558
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:05,679
(Wind howls outside)

559
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:08,556
Look, there are...

560
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,643
rational explanations behind this.

561
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:14,062
Behind everything that's going on.

562
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,272
I think we need to go home.

563
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:20,819
I'll get someone to drive us...
Not yet!

564
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:22,737
Why?

565
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:28,201
Just not yet.

566
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:30,995
I need to understand what happened.

567
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:35,458
You can understand it
on the plane ride home.

568
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,925
Here.

569
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,970
Take these.

570
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:48,847
Take them.

571
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:50,682
They'll help you sleep.

572
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:52,475
Come on, take them!

573
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:56,146
You're not making a believer
out of me, son.

574
00:39:56,229 --> 00:39:58,273
It was an accident.

575
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:03,028
I swear to Christ,
it was an accident.

576
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:12,203
Jesus.
What the hell was that?

577
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:14,414
I'm not sure.

578
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,959
See that? Whoa, wait. Look.

579
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:24,257
Time code goes from 1:32am...
to 3:57am... back to 1:32am.

580
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:27,344
In the middle of the footage?
How does that happen?

581
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:30,680
I don't know. But those were
the hours that we fell asleep.

582
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:33,808
Can you make it bigger,
or slow it down?

583
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:36,019
Let me try slowing it down.

584
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:42,859
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is a naked woman.

585
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:45,737
What is a naked woman doing
swinging around a tree?

586
00:40:45,862 --> 00:40:47,614
Are we sure these are our tapes?

587
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:50,325
I'm not sure of anything
in the last 24 hours.

588
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,788
I'll re-digitise this at a higher
resolution so I can blow it up.

589
00:40:54,871 --> 00:40:56,998
This will take a few minutes.

590
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:59,417
I need alcohol.

591
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:00,752
Caffeine.

592
00:41:01,586 --> 00:41:03,129
Caffeine!

593
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:07,175
Sure. I live to serve.

594
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:20,230
Ugh... great.

595
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:25,318
Stale coffee, no beer,
some old take-out chicken...

596
00:41:25,443 --> 00:41:27,779
but plenty of batteries.

597
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:30,323
Hey...

598
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:33,451
What's going on?
We're leaving in the morning.

599
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:34,786
Really?

600
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:39,541
It's... It's Tristen.

601
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,877
She's in bad shape.

602
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:45,463
This whole thing has really
fucked her up.

603
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:49,259
How come you're the one who looks
like he's having a breakdown?

604
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,886
Look! I'm a little tense, all right?

605
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,098
Sorry.

606
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,394
No, I am...

607
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,105
sorry.

608
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:04,649
I just feel like my whole life's

609
00:42:04,774 --> 00:42:07,277
been turned upside down
the past two days.

610
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:08,653
I know.

611
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:14,200
It's been really crazy for you,
but it's gonna be Ok.

612
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:16,036
I promise.

613
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,454
That feels good.

614
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:19,456
You ARE tense.

615
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,336
Like that?
Yeah.

616
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:28,214
Lower?

617
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:31,634
Yeah, lower.

618
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:35,430
How does that feel?
Good.

619
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:37,140
Lower?

620
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:41,728
How does that feel?

621
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,047
(Ripping and scraping)

622
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:15,595
Do they hurt?

623
00:43:16,262 --> 00:43:19,015
No. They're just a little warm.

624
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,684
Don't worry.

625
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:23,561
I have them, too.

626
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:40,036
(Kim) Guys...

627
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,122
want to come up here?

628
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:47,752
You're out of beer,
if that's what you want to know.

629
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:50,380
Jeff found a better angle
on this naked chick.

630
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:52,757
What naked chick?
Cool. How?

631
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,426
I blew up the image.

632
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:56,511
(Kim) It's a bit weird to watch...

633
00:43:56,594 --> 00:44:00,056
Like watching a hold-up
on a bank security camera.

634
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,850
(Kim) You get the gist.

635
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:05,228
(Stephen) Where is this?
(Jeff) The foundation.

636
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:09,065
(Erica) This was last night?
Yeah. During the big blackout.

637
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:11,359
(Stephen) Can you let us
see her face?

638
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:12,777
Sure can.

639
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:21,619
If this is a joke... it ain't funny.

640
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,789
No joke. It's serious, Erica.

641
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:27,125
While I was gone,
you messed with things.

642
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,626
(Jeff) No.

643
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,504
It doesn't make any sense.
I know.

644
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:34,716
We were hoping you could explain.
I don't have a clue.

645
00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:37,177
You have no memory of doing this?
No.

646
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,138
(Jeff) If it's some wicca thing,
you can tell us.

647
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:42,140
(Kim) Try and help us understand.

648
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:45,727
We're just trying to put together
what happened last night.

649
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,814
Find out who trashed my equipment.
That wasn't me. I didn't do that.

650
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:52,359
Erica, that's you there
on the screen.

651
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:55,195
Leave me the hell alone, all of you!

652
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:01,910
Believe her?

653
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:03,995
I don't know.

654
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,502
Jeff, give me your keys to the van.

655
00:45:10,585 --> 00:45:14,422
Where you going?
I have to get out. I need a beer.

656
00:45:16,007 --> 00:45:18,093
Hey, see if we need more coffee.

657
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:21,805
(Erica chanting)

658
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:24,599
...earth and fire, water and smoke...

659
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:27,268
I am going to the store.
You want to come...?

660
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:29,896
(Continues chanting, sobbing)

661
00:45:29,979 --> 00:45:31,815
Erica?

662
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:36,528
Erica!

663
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:42,534
We brought something back with us.

664
00:45:42,617 --> 00:45:44,619
What are you talking about?

665
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,123
I can sense it...

666
00:45:48,206 --> 00:45:50,041
...like someone's choking me...

667
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,085
...and squeezing the air out of me.

668
00:45:52,168 --> 00:45:57,799
Look, we're just tired, Ok?
We're all really tired. That is it.

669
00:45:57,924 --> 00:46:00,135
I want to show you something.

670
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:08,268
I have got the same thing.
It's nothing, it's like poison oak.

671
00:46:08,351 --> 00:46:10,145
But, Kim...

672
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,646
They're growing.

673
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:22,198
(Erica) Ancient pagan alphabet.

674
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:25,577
They say it means
you've been touched by a witch.

675
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:32,751
(Sobbing) That you're next
chosen to die.

676
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:34,502
There's something here!

677
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:36,713
There's something here!

678
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:48,933
Sweet.

679
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:51,394
Yo, Morticia.

680
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,856
Hey, Elvira, I got something
you can suck the blood out of.

681
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:57,025
Oh, yeah? Whip it out.

682
00:47:04,824 --> 00:47:06,993
Excuse me, sorry.

683
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:09,204
I'm finished now.

684
00:47:14,584 --> 00:47:16,294
What the...?!

685
00:47:16,419 --> 00:47:17,754
What is your problem?

686
00:47:17,879 --> 00:47:20,548
You're with the witch people.
Lady...

687
00:47:20,632 --> 00:47:22,467
I'm just here to buy groceries.

688
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,219
Witch!

689
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:29,766
Freak.

690
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:40,068
Am I gonna have a problem
with you, too?

691
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:41,945
No problem.

692
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:44,698
Good. Let's go.

693
00:47:47,867 --> 00:47:49,494
Ok, look...

694
00:47:49,577 --> 00:47:52,914
Either you ring this stuff up...
or I call your manager.

695
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:55,291
I am the manager.

696
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:58,586
Really?
Yeah.

697
00:48:00,755 --> 00:48:03,008
Well, then, Peggy...

698
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:08,805
could you tell the bitch at the front
register to do her goddamn job?!

699
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:10,265
Get the hell out of here!

700
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,268
Not until I've completed my purchase.

701
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:16,146
We don't want people like you
around here.

702
00:48:16,229 --> 00:48:20,150
You know what? I am gonna make this
so easy on you, Peggy.

703
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:25,822
I told you to get
the hell out of here.

704
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:28,491
You touch me again...

705
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:32,203
and I will rip out
your goddamn throat!

706
00:48:35,373 --> 00:48:37,709
Keep your motherfucking change!

707
00:48:57,354 --> 00:49:01,066
Persephone, do I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

708
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:04,194
Persephone, do I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

709
00:49:04,652 --> 00:49:07,489
Persephone, do I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

710
00:49:07,864 --> 00:49:10,533
Persephone, I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

711
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:13,578
Persephone, I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

712
00:49:13,703 --> 00:49:16,373
Persephone, I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

713
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:19,793
Persephone, I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

714
00:49:19,876 --> 00:49:23,004
Persephone, I invoke... (Sobbing) by
earth and fire, and water and smoke...

715
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:24,255
Persephone, I invoke...

716
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:26,383
(Continues)

717
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:30,136
(Sobbing)

718
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,515
(Indistinct disembodied chanting)

719
00:49:37,143 --> 00:49:38,937
(Heavy metal)

720
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:42,774
(Increases volume)

721
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:48,947
Stone the witch!
Stone the bitch!

722
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:50,615
Fucking rednecks!

723
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:12,053
(Distant crying)

724
00:50:13,763 --> 00:50:15,390
(Crying continues)

725
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:47,881
Ow!

726
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,148
(Jeff) Kim?

727
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:08,026
Make me a pot of coffee
on your way up.

728
00:51:14,074 --> 00:51:16,284
You're welcome.

729
00:51:16,368 --> 00:51:19,579
(Creaking and clock ticking)

730
00:51:24,584 --> 00:51:27,212
Look, I fucked up your front fender.

731
00:51:27,295 --> 00:51:31,174
I had to swerve
to avoid hitting these little kids.

732
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:37,555
They were dressed funny, like
from another time. Seven of them.

733
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:38,807
Jeff!

734
00:51:39,015 --> 00:51:40,225
I know this is crazy,

735
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:43,395
but I know those are the kids
Rustin Parr killed!

736
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:51,736
Coffee.

737
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,489
Next to your arm.

738
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:14,634
Morning.
Hey. Did you sleep Ok?

739
00:52:14,759 --> 00:52:17,846
Yeah, I slept Ok. You?
Yeah.

740
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:20,724
You ready to go?
Yeah. Are you guys ready?

741
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:22,017
Yeah.

742
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,310
I... appreciate your driving us.

743
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:28,398
Yeah. I'll get the keys from Jeff.

744
00:52:38,491 --> 00:52:40,326
Come on, Tristen, wake up.

745
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:45,040
Come on, let's go.
Not yet...

746
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:46,916
Tristen, we're going home.

747
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,918
Erica?

748
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:52,547
Erica!

749
00:52:53,965 --> 00:52:55,342
Erica?

750
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:00,388
Erica!
(Jeff) Not up here.

751
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:03,058
Not up there? You sure?
She was just here.

752
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:05,894
Didn't you hear me?
I just said she's not up here.

753
00:53:05,977 --> 00:53:07,937
Why don't you go check out the van...

754
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:10,523
What the hell happened to the van?

755
00:53:14,152 --> 00:53:18,198
(Stephen) Jesus Christ.
We are never gonna get out of here...

756
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:19,908
Kim, what the hell did you do?

757
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:22,702
You said you just busted up
the front end!

758
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:24,829
How the hell did you drive it back?

759
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,209
I swear it was just the front fender.

760
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:30,919
What the fuck is going on?!

761
00:53:31,002 --> 00:53:34,631
They dip their hands in your blood
then press them on your body.

762
00:53:34,756 --> 00:53:37,676
What are you talking about?
The children.

763
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:43,306
Something I dreamt.
Jeff dreamt it, too. Look.

764
00:53:44,683 --> 00:53:45,934
Look!

765
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:52,232
Oh, Jesus! What the hell is this?

766
00:53:52,315 --> 00:53:55,944
Something from the woods.
We've all got them. Me, her, Erica...

767
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:58,196
Where is Erica?

768
00:53:59,614 --> 00:54:00,824
Erica?

769
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:04,035
Erica?

770
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:06,037
Erica!

771
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:10,083
What the...?

772
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:25,015
Erica!

773
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,224
(Dog barking)

774
00:54:26,307 --> 00:54:27,892
Erica!

775
00:54:29,602 --> 00:54:31,021
ERICA!

776
00:54:42,365 --> 00:54:45,910
We would've heard the dog alarm
when she went outside.

777
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:49,247
It's like she fucking vanished.

778
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:54,419
Evaporated is more like it.
Yeah, right, Kim.

779
00:54:54,544 --> 00:54:57,756
You were the one who found
her clothes and those candles.

780
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,508
(Kim) What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

781
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:03,803
A prank. Two little bitches
trying to freak us out.

782
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,722
You paranoid fuck!
Come on!

783
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:07,849
We'd never do something like that!

784
00:55:07,932 --> 00:55:10,935
Where is she, Kim? Where is she?

785
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:13,396
Why are her clothes and shit
still here?

786
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,647
How would I know?

787
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:17,734
Can't you see her, Kimmy,
in your mind's eye?

788
00:55:17,817 --> 00:55:19,944
Very funny, asshole!

789
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:24,074
I think something really bad
has happened to her.

790
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:26,076
Maybe she called somebody.

791
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:29,329
(Jeff) I'd like to speak
to Minister Geerson, please.

792
00:55:29,412 --> 00:55:32,707
(Woman) "He's in a meeting.
Could he return your call?"

793
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:35,960
No. It's urgent.
"Could I tell him what it's about?"

794
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:39,798
Yeah. His daughter, Erica.
We wanna know if he's heard from her.

795
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:42,592
The minister and Mrs Geerson
have no daughter.

796
00:55:42,717 --> 00:55:46,846
No, I know, like, they disowned her
or something because she's a witch...

797
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,224
"They've never had any children. "

798
00:55:49,307 --> 00:55:51,017
(Dial tone)

799
00:55:59,275 --> 00:56:00,860
So she made up a story.

800
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:04,322
She gave us a fake name.
It doesn't have to mean anything.

801
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:05,573
She lied to us.

802
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:09,369
Why are we seeing all this shit?
Why is all this happening?

803
00:56:09,452 --> 00:56:13,206
I don't know. Collective delusion.
Group hysteria.

804
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:17,669
It's what my book is about. You get
a bunch of people scared enough...

805
00:56:17,752 --> 00:56:20,380
Dude, spare us the bullshit. Please.

806
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:23,049
It's real. Dude(!)

807
00:56:23,174 --> 00:56:24,467
It happens.

808
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:28,930
They teach it at junior colleges
I bet that even you could get into.

809
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:32,183
How did you get into yours?
You have to brush your teeth?

810
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:33,893
(Kim) Jeff, the screen.

811
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:35,645
Roll it back, rewind it.

812
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:40,859
No, more.

813
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:45,864
(Jeff) Oh, shit.

814
00:56:45,947 --> 00:56:48,742
I knew they'd come back
and mess with my stuff.

815
00:56:48,825 --> 00:56:50,201
(Phone)

816
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:56,124
Fuck off. No one's home.

817
00:56:56,207 --> 00:56:57,792
It's Cravens.
"Sheriff?"

818
00:56:57,959 --> 00:57:02,213
Funny. I just found out who trashed
my cameras. I was about to call you.

819
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:03,548
Turn on your TV.

820
00:57:03,631 --> 00:57:06,551
"I don't give a shit.
I want you to see something. "

821
00:57:06,634 --> 00:57:07,927
Me, too. News at 11:00.

822
00:57:08,094 --> 00:57:10,930
Shit. Will you just turn that on?
Humour him.

823
00:57:11,765 --> 00:57:13,892
You watching?
Like a hawk.

824
00:57:13,975 --> 00:57:17,812
Listen, I'm trying to tell you
what I found out on Friday night.

825
00:57:17,937 --> 00:57:19,689
"This is a special report. "

826
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:22,859
"A brutal murder in the Black Hills
discovered today"

827
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:25,111
"the bodies of five hikers found dead"

828
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:27,697
"atop the landmark
known as Coffin Rock. "

829
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:29,657
Disembowelled, Jeffrey.

830
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:32,911
"A re-creation
of the infamous Coffin Rock massacre"

831
00:57:32,994 --> 00:57:35,663
"popularised by the movie
The Blair... "

832
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:38,875
Bodies were laid out
in the shape of a pentagram.

833
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:40,502
Sound familiar?

834
00:57:40,585 --> 00:57:44,464
"We've received word that the victims
include two Chinese tourists"

835
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:47,926
"and one German, as well as
two unidentified white males. "

836
00:57:48,009 --> 00:57:51,262
"Recently, the Black Hills
has been overrun with fans"

837
00:57:51,346 --> 00:57:54,641
"wanting to get a glimpse
of where the movie was filmed. "

838
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:57,560
(Cravens) "You looking at me?"
What?

839
00:57:57,644 --> 00:57:59,145
"Over here. "

840
00:57:59,229 --> 00:58:00,563
(Kim) There.

841
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:03,692
(Jeff) Yeah?
"I didn't find your cameras. "

842
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:06,194
"Don't guess that's a surprise,
is it?"

843
00:58:06,277 --> 00:58:09,447
What do you want from me?
I got five corpses here!

844
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:11,491
I had nothing to do with that.

845
00:58:11,574 --> 00:58:14,953
You might not have been in charge
but you were involved,

846
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:18,248
so you and your little friends
had best just sit tight.

847
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:23,253
"And that means... you don't leave
this county till I say it's Ok. "

848
00:58:50,321 --> 00:58:52,407
I don't know you, Stephen.

849
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:56,953
I don't know a thing about you.

850
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:03,501
I don't know how much to believe
about any of you people...

851
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,297
But from now on...

852
00:59:08,298 --> 00:59:12,135
know this:
you are not leaving me here alone

853
00:59:12,218 --> 00:59:14,304
to take the fall for this shit.

854
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,058
Nobody is going out of my sight.

855
00:59:30,487 --> 00:59:32,489
We brought something back with us.

856
00:59:33,281 --> 00:59:35,492
For Christ's sake, Kim...

857
00:59:36,785 --> 00:59:39,037
I'll tell you what's going on here.

858
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:46,628
It's Erica...

859
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:49,798
or whoever the fuck she is.

860
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:55,720
Erica has got nothing to do
with this.

861
00:59:55,804 --> 00:59:59,099
She's a witch, man!
She's one big pissed-off witch!

862
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:02,894
She's casting fucking spells,
making herself appear,

863
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:05,271
making herself fucking disappear.

864
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:07,107
It's been her since day one!

865
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:10,318
Smoke it up, cos you're not totally
psycho yet!

866
01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:13,697
Where are you going?
The fuck away from you!

867
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,073
You're a dick.

868
01:00:15,156 --> 01:00:16,157
Kim!

869
01:00:16,241 --> 01:00:19,452
Jeff, you've got to have friends,
somebody with a car...

870
01:00:19,577 --> 01:00:23,248
What did I tell you?!
You're not going anywhere!

871
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:28,294
Wipe that shit off your face.

872
01:00:30,922 --> 01:00:34,759
You think that your makeup
and black clothes give you power...

873
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:39,681
...but you're just a scared, cowardly
little girl underneath all that.

874
01:00:39,764 --> 01:00:41,641
(Erica) You don't understand.

875
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:44,561
Something happened to us
in the woods.

876
01:00:46,896 --> 01:00:48,732
Something evil.

877
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:51,026
Why are you so mad at me?

878
01:00:53,778 --> 01:00:54,946
(Siren)

879
01:00:55,071 --> 01:00:58,241
Calm down. I'm not that pissed.

880
01:01:00,535 --> 01:01:02,328
Just stop badmouthing Erica.

881
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:05,248
She's outside.
Where?

882
01:01:05,373 --> 01:01:06,624
Right there.

883
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:14,341
There's nothing out there.

884
01:01:16,634 --> 01:01:19,304
Tristen, let's get you back to bed.

885
01:01:19,387 --> 01:01:23,016
You just got to look, Stephen.
Let's go to the bedroom.

886
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:25,143
Look again.

887
01:01:32,233 --> 01:01:33,735
She's out there!

888
01:01:35,153 --> 01:01:37,280
(Dogs barking)

889
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:40,575
Erica.

890
01:01:41,409 --> 01:01:43,745
What happened to you?

891
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:45,914
Don't be afraid.

892
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:48,166
You know who it is.

893
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:51,920
What?
And you know what you have to do.

894
01:01:53,171 --> 01:01:54,297
Erica!

895
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,270
You know who it is.

896
01:02:10,397 --> 01:02:11,439
Erica?

897
01:02:11,564 --> 01:02:12,899
(Distant laughter)

898
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:20,532
Tristen, help me. Help me!

899
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:24,536
Tristen!

900
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:26,871
Aw, Tristen...

901
01:02:27,622 --> 01:02:29,416
Stephen! I got you, grab my hand.

902
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:31,501
Come on, hold on.

903
01:02:36,047 --> 01:02:38,508
They did it, the little Buster Boys.

904
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,760
They did it! They hanged her!

905
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:42,429
The little Buster Boys!

906
01:02:42,512 --> 01:02:44,139
Tristen! Shh! Shh!

907
01:02:44,264 --> 01:02:46,433
It's only a dream. It's only a dream!

908
01:02:46,516 --> 01:02:50,353
They're Elly Kedward's dreams!
I don't know why I'm having them.

909
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:52,856
Why do you think
they're Elly Kedward's?

910
01:02:52,939 --> 01:02:55,442
Cos I was seeing them
through her eyes...

911
01:02:55,525 --> 01:02:58,778
...tied to the tree
where they banished her to.

912
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:01,489
And the bad little boys
from Blair village...

913
01:03:01,573 --> 01:03:04,951
...sneaking out to the woods
to see if she was still alive...

914
01:03:05,035 --> 01:03:07,495
...and... and they let their big dogs
bite her...

915
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,833
...and they poked her with sticks and
then when the blood came out of her...

916
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:16,338
...they put their palms in it
and pressed it on her flesh!

917
01:03:16,421 --> 01:03:19,674
And then, when they found
she was still alive...

918
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:23,261
...they untied her... and they put
the ropes around her neck...

919
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:26,222
...and they hanged her
from the big tree!

920
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:35,065
Stephen, I think I'm going
fucking crazy!

921
01:03:35,148 --> 01:03:38,276
No! No, you are not going crazy.

922
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,028
Do you hear me?

923
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:43,740
You are not going crazy.

924
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,747
It's Ok.

925
01:03:51,289 --> 01:03:52,874
It's Ok.

926
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:56,127
It's all right.

927
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:09,599
(Footsteps approaching)

928
01:04:09,724 --> 01:04:13,019
Jeff? Listen, I'm really worried
about Tristen.

929
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:15,897
Do you know the name
of the doctor she was with?

930
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,107
No, no, I don't.

931
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:19,651
Then I think you need to call
the hospital.

932
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:22,946
Ok. I think there's a phone book
in the desk drawer.

933
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:45,635
What is this?

934
01:04:51,558 --> 01:04:53,435
What the fuck is this?

935
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,478
What?
These!

936
01:04:58,648 --> 01:05:00,692
I don't know. Where did you get 'em?

937
01:05:00,775 --> 01:05:03,194
In your desk!
What, are you spying on us?

938
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:06,239
What the hell are you talking about?
No, I'm not!

939
01:05:06,322 --> 01:05:08,241
I've no idea where this came from!

940
01:05:08,324 --> 01:05:10,243
Where'd you get this? Answer me!

941
01:05:10,326 --> 01:05:12,829
She found 'em.
Maybe she put 'em in there!

942
01:05:12,912 --> 01:05:15,790
I wanna know where you got these!
I've no idea!

943
01:05:19,127 --> 01:05:22,839
We've been looking into
your background, Stephen.

944
01:05:22,964 --> 01:05:26,509
You've been such a good little boy
all your life.

945
01:05:26,593 --> 01:05:28,928
How did you get mixed up in all this?

946
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:34,934
(Phone)

947
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:39,105
What?

948
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:41,149
"It's Cravens, you little shit!"

949
01:05:41,232 --> 01:05:44,069
Sheriff, I'm a little preoccupied
right now.

950
01:05:44,152 --> 01:05:47,113
"I need to talk to you.
Get your butt down here. "

951
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:51,326
My van is trashed. And you know mommy
doesn't let me out after dark.

952
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:55,121
"I'm right at your front door,
you little twerp! Get down here!"

953
01:05:55,246 --> 01:05:57,874
How can he be out there?
The bridge is gone.

954
01:05:59,709 --> 01:06:01,586
(Kim) This is too weird.

955
01:06:01,711 --> 01:06:03,713
(Bang)
(Cravens) Here!

956
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:05,131
(Bang)
Jeffrey!

957
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:06,883
(Bang)
It's Cravens!

958
01:06:06,966 --> 01:06:08,677
(Banging continues)

959
01:06:09,803 --> 01:06:12,681
We got a few things
to talk about, boy!

960
01:06:12,764 --> 01:06:14,891
(Banging)

961
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:18,561
You were a punk as a kid,
and you're still a punk!

962
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:20,480
Open up, Jeff!

963
01:06:20,605 --> 01:06:21,981
(Banging)

964
01:06:27,445 --> 01:06:29,531
Open the goddamn door!

965
01:06:29,614 --> 01:06:31,950
(Banging)

966
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:36,871
If you know what's good for you,
you'll open the damn door!

967
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:39,582
You open up
this goddamn door right now!

968
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:46,047
I told you to stay out
of those woods.

969
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:50,385
They're not gonna just send you back
to the loony bin this time.

970
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:58,435
Open the goddamn door!

971
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:01,104
(Barking)

972
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:18,955
(Barking continues)

973
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:35,138
Jeff!

974
01:07:37,432 --> 01:07:39,684
What the fuck, dude?
Put the gun down.

975
01:07:39,809 --> 01:07:40,977
Put the gun down!

976
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:48,193
Erica.

977
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:50,070
What are you doing?

978
01:07:52,238 --> 01:07:53,573
Erica.

979
01:08:00,955 --> 01:08:02,374
(Kim) That's gross!

980
01:08:02,457 --> 01:08:05,835
(Stephen) She... she's...! Oh, God!

981
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,712
(Flies buzzing)

982
01:08:09,881 --> 01:08:11,508
(Clock ticking)

983
01:08:17,138 --> 01:08:20,475
You were the last one to see her
still alive.

984
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,148
The last time I saw her,
she was heading up here to see you.

985
01:08:29,984 --> 01:08:31,528
I didn't kill her, Stephen.

986
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:40,537
Don't even think it.
Kim was up here with me!

987
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:43,456
Well, let me clue you in
to something, all right?

988
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:46,251
She didn't commit fucking suicide!

989
01:08:48,211 --> 01:08:49,796
One of you...
Oh, wait!

990
01:08:49,921 --> 01:08:53,174
What about you?
What gets you off the goddamn hook?

991
01:08:53,258 --> 01:08:57,220
My word!
Which is worth exactly shit to me!

992
01:08:58,513 --> 01:09:01,558
Where was your little girlfriend
this whole time?

993
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:05,979
Oh, for Christ's sake!
She can barely get out of bed...

994
01:09:09,858 --> 01:09:11,443
It's backwards.

995
01:09:11,526 --> 01:09:13,194
Go back to bed, Tristen.

996
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:15,864
The little girl backwards.

997
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:17,824
Erica dancing...

998
01:09:18,533 --> 01:09:19,659
backwards.

999
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,369
Everything backwards.

1000
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:23,163
What are you talking about?

1001
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:27,417
Widdershins.

1002
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:29,210
Undo the evil.

1003
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:31,338
What the fuck is a widdershin?

1004
01:09:31,463 --> 01:09:34,007
(Speaking gibberish)

1005
01:09:36,176 --> 01:09:38,928
All right,
she's lost her fucking mind.

1006
01:09:39,929 --> 01:09:41,389
That's it.

1007
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:42,974
Backwards.

1008
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:44,309
Backwards!
What?

1009
01:09:44,434 --> 01:09:46,686
We need to run the tapes backwards.

1010
01:09:46,853 --> 01:09:48,021
Why?
I don't know.

1011
01:09:48,104 --> 01:09:51,066
I think it'll help us find out
what happened to Erica.

1012
01:09:51,149 --> 01:09:52,650
This makes no sense!

1013
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:54,944
I know it doesn't. Just please do it!

1014
01:09:55,028 --> 01:09:58,323
(Tristen murmuring)

1015
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,663
See? Nothing.

1016
01:10:06,915 --> 01:10:09,668
Try the-the-the
keystrokes backwards.

1017
01:10:09,751 --> 01:10:11,878
You know, the fucking commands.

1018
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,761
You see? You guys happy?
There's nothing!

1019
01:10:32,107 --> 01:10:33,608
There's your missing hours.

1020
01:10:35,026 --> 01:10:37,487
(Jeff) This must be
when we blacked out.

1021
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:12,392
Tristen...

1022
01:13:14,477 --> 01:13:16,187
What is this?

1023
01:13:16,271 --> 01:13:18,273
What did you make us do?

1024
01:13:20,775 --> 01:13:23,445
You're leading us, aren't you?

1025
01:13:27,907 --> 01:13:30,785
Weren't you watching
the fucking screen?

1026
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:37,000
No.

1027
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:40,211
Get back here!
Grab her!

1028
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:46,176
Get your hands off me.

1029
01:13:46,259 --> 01:13:47,886
What did you do, Tristen?

1030
01:13:47,969 --> 01:13:49,929
Stephen, please tell them to stop.

1031
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:53,850
Why aren't you marked like this?
Like the rest of us, like Erica?

1032
01:13:53,975 --> 01:13:55,352
What did you do to Erica?

1033
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:58,021
Stephen, why are you letting them
do this?

1034
01:13:58,104 --> 01:13:59,481
(Kim) You killed Erica!

1035
01:13:59,564 --> 01:14:03,276
(Tristen) You two are crazy!
Shh, shh, shh! Listen.

1036
01:14:03,401 --> 01:14:05,528
Just admit it to the camera.

1037
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:08,198
We're not gonna take the fall
for Erica.

1038
01:14:08,323 --> 01:14:14,537
Ok? Just admit it. Don't worry,
sweetie. We're not gonna hurt you.

1039
01:14:14,662 --> 01:14:16,289
Not like you hurt the baby.

1040
01:14:16,373 --> 01:14:19,209
What? I didn't have anything
to do with the baby.

1041
01:14:19,292 --> 01:14:21,211
The witch kills children!

1042
01:14:21,294 --> 01:14:25,173
I... haven't killed anybody!

1043
01:14:25,256 --> 01:14:26,883
(Kim) Bullshit!

1044
01:14:28,176 --> 01:14:31,721
Oh, God, Stephen.
Tristen, just say the words!

1045
01:14:31,805 --> 01:14:33,515
Just say the words...

1046
01:14:34,099 --> 01:14:35,600
(Kim screams)

1047
01:14:48,822 --> 01:14:51,074
You're all gonna fucking die.

1048
01:14:59,082 --> 01:15:01,251
You wanna kill me?
No.

1049
01:15:01,334 --> 01:15:04,379
No, I just want to understand.

1050
01:15:04,504 --> 01:15:07,757
But you can't understand
because you're so afraid!

1051
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:12,178
Just like the pathetic children
of Blair village, so frightened!

1052
01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:16,641
Aren't you, little girl?
Who are you?

1053
01:15:16,766 --> 01:15:18,810
She's the witch, man!

1054
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,771
(Gasps)

1055
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:25,066
(Deep voice) Is that
what you think... crazy boy?

1056
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:28,111
Tristen! Tristen, talk to me!

1057
01:15:28,194 --> 01:15:31,448
Stephen...
What is it, baby, what is it?

1058
01:15:32,782 --> 01:15:35,368
Tristen's gone.
(Kim) Get away from him!

1059
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:39,456
That's not... how you do it.

1060
01:15:43,376 --> 01:15:44,836
This is what you want.

1061
01:15:50,508 --> 01:15:53,053
Tristen, whatever you're doing...
don't!

1062
01:15:53,178 --> 01:15:56,222
I'm not doing anything, honey.
It's all up to you!

1063
01:15:56,348 --> 01:15:58,058
Witch bitch.

1064
01:15:58,141 --> 01:15:59,392
Why did you kill Erica?

1065
01:15:59,559 --> 01:16:01,019
(Sniffs)

1066
01:16:01,102 --> 01:16:03,104
(Sniffing)

1067
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:04,773
I can smell the fear on you.

1068
01:16:04,856 --> 01:16:07,609
Stay away from me.

1069
01:16:07,734 --> 01:16:09,319
You wanna kill me?

1070
01:16:09,402 --> 01:16:12,072
You can't, can you, Kimmy?

1071
01:16:12,155 --> 01:16:14,491
I will rip your fucking head off!

1072
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:17,077
Then fucking do it!
Stop it!

1073
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,703
Stop it.

1074
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:24,417
Aw, isn't that
what your book's about, Stephen?

1075
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:26,961
People just want to see something?

1076
01:16:30,048 --> 01:16:31,966
You have no balls.

1077
01:16:32,133 --> 01:16:35,387
You can't do it, you weak,
little pathetic...

1078
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:39,599
Oh, you were the last fucking one
with the balls, you little bitch.

1079
01:16:39,683 --> 01:16:40,684
No!

1080
01:16:51,194 --> 01:16:53,738
(Screams)

1081
01:16:59,244 --> 01:17:00,829
(Screaming)

1082
01:17:12,716 --> 01:17:15,010
(Rope creaking)

1083
01:17:44,622 --> 01:17:45,957
(Screaming)

1084
01:17:48,084 --> 01:17:51,379
"I'm standing in front
of an abandoned broom factory... "

1085
01:17:51,504 --> 01:17:55,216
"... in Jericho Mills, a few miles from
the town of Burkittsville... "

1086
01:17:55,383 --> 01:17:59,429
"... where, just hours ago, police
arrested three obsessed movie fans... "

1087
01:17:59,512 --> 01:18:03,016
"... who allegedly committed a series
of ritualistic murders... "

1088
01:18:03,099 --> 01:18:05,810
"... after watching last summer's
blockbuster... "

1089
01:18:05,852 --> 01:18:07,479
"... the Blair Witch Project. "

1090
01:18:07,604 --> 01:18:10,690
'This vehicle,
which you see behind me... "

1091
01:18:10,815 --> 01:18:12,901
"... is owned by one of the suspects... "

1092
01:18:12,984 --> 01:18:17,447
"... and there is blood evidence linking
the suspects to these murders. "

1093
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:21,242
"Sadly, as has happened so many times
before in this country... "

1094
01:18:21,326 --> 01:18:24,621
"... violent art has inspired
real-life violence. "

1095
01:18:24,704 --> 01:18:27,582
"In this case,
it's the Blair Witch Project. "

1096
01:18:27,665 --> 01:18:32,545
(Cravens) I ain't no documentary
film-maker,

1097
01:18:32,629 --> 01:18:35,382
but I had your videotapes

1098
01:18:35,465 --> 01:18:38,468
slapped together
over at Montgomery College.

1099
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:43,264
Sorta tells the whole story.

1100
01:18:45,975 --> 01:18:47,394
Great.

1101
01:18:47,519 --> 01:18:50,397
You could see how fucking insane
Tristen was.

1102
01:18:50,522 --> 01:18:53,525
She practically begged Stephen
to push her.

1103
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,702
Gutting those tourists...

1104
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:06,955
How'd you have the stomach for that?

1105
01:19:13,628 --> 01:19:14,629
Yeah...

1106
01:19:18,508 --> 01:19:21,469
I don't remember doing that.

1107
01:19:27,225 --> 01:19:30,020
Let's talk about... Peggy.

1108
01:19:36,484 --> 01:19:38,153
What?

1109
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:45,952
(Reporter) "Apparently one woman
was hanged, and the other victim... "

1110
01:19:46,077 --> 01:19:48,997
"... the cause of death has yet
to be determined.

1111
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:52,500
"Ironically, both women were murdered
by their friends... "

1112
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:56,338
"... after allegedly participating
in a vicious killing spree... "

1113
01:19:56,463 --> 01:19:57,714
"... in the Black Hills. "

1114
01:19:57,839 --> 01:20:00,842
(2nd reporter) "The police
have not offered a motive... "

1115
01:20:00,925 --> 01:20:05,388
"... but apparently the two slain female
killers were involved in witchcraft. "

1116
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:09,225
And, um... what about the redhead?

1117
01:20:10,602 --> 01:20:12,729
She was a real pretty girl.

1118
01:20:13,938 --> 01:20:16,149
She wouldn't put out or something?

1119
01:20:16,691 --> 01:20:19,152
No, we just found her in the closet.

1120
01:20:20,695 --> 01:20:22,489
It was Tristen.

1121
01:20:25,283 --> 01:20:27,243
The witch got into her...

1122
01:20:27,369 --> 01:20:29,371
fucked with her mind or something.

1123
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:38,463
And your girlfriend? Killing her
because she had a miscarriage.

1124
01:20:38,588 --> 01:20:41,257
Whoo-whee! Now, that's harsh.

1125
01:20:41,341 --> 01:20:43,843
She wrapped the rope around her neck.

1126
01:20:45,887 --> 01:20:48,473
She was taunting me...

1127
01:20:48,556 --> 01:20:50,308
begging me to push her.

1128
01:20:52,477 --> 01:20:54,771
You're not making a believer
out of me.

1129
01:20:54,854 --> 01:20:56,564
It was an accident!

1130
01:20:56,648 --> 01:21:00,777
(Sobbing) I swear to Christ
it was an accident!

1131
01:21:00,902 --> 01:21:03,697
(Reporter) "Local officials are urging calm... "

1132
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,700
"... and trying to keep curiosity
seekers at bay. "

1133
01:21:06,783 --> 01:21:08,910
"And as has happened in the past... "

1134
01:21:09,035 --> 01:21:11,121
"... rumours about a... "

1135
01:21:11,204 --> 01:21:14,207
"... supernatural presence
causing these murders... "

1136
01:21:14,290 --> 01:21:18,003
"... are spreading like wildfire
over the internet. "

1137
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:21,339
(Stephen) W-wait... wait.

1138
01:21:21,423 --> 01:21:23,049
Wait a... wait a second.

1139
01:21:23,133 --> 01:21:24,300
Jeff...

1140
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:26,052
Jeff...

1141
01:21:26,136 --> 01:21:27,804
He...

1142
01:21:27,887 --> 01:21:30,056
He videotaped the whole thing.

1143
01:21:33,476 --> 01:21:36,271
Watch the tapes. You'll see.

1144
01:21:38,982 --> 01:21:41,484
Look at the goddamn tapes!

1145
01:21:44,487 --> 01:21:45,572
Yes, sir.

1146
01:21:47,323 --> 01:21:49,534
Too much trouble
to pay for your beer?

1147
01:21:49,617 --> 01:21:51,494
I didn't do that.

1148
01:21:53,788 --> 01:21:55,248
Oh, yeah?

1149
01:21:55,331 --> 01:21:56,332
Then, um...

1150
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:58,335
who's this?

1151
01:22:12,557 --> 01:22:14,559
I didn't do that.

1152
01:22:18,104 --> 01:22:19,939
I didn't do that.

1153
01:22:28,406 --> 01:22:30,075
That's not how it happened.

1154
01:22:34,913 --> 01:22:36,790
I didn't do that.

1155
01:22:51,763 --> 01:22:53,765
That's not how it happened.

1156
01:22:55,392 --> 01:22:57,185
Stop it.

1157
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:03,108
(Jeff) "Just... just do it!
Just admit it to the camera. "

1158
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:06,486
"We're not gonna take the fall
for Erica. "

1159
01:23:06,569 --> 01:23:08,947
"Don't worry,
we're not gonna hurt you. "

1160
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:10,615
"Not like you hurt the baby. "

1161
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:13,660
"What? I didn't have anything
to do with the baby. "

1162
01:23:13,785 --> 01:23:15,662
"The witch kills children!"

1163
01:23:15,787 --> 01:23:19,207
"I... haven't killed anybody!"

1164
01:23:19,332 --> 01:23:20,917
"Bullshit!"
"No!"

1165
01:23:21,001 --> 01:23:24,504
"Tell us the truth.
Tell us the truth. "

1166
01:23:24,587 --> 01:23:27,048
"Confess. "
"God!"

1167
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:31,928
"Stephen, this is me.
What are you talking about?"

1168
01:23:32,012 --> 01:23:33,805
(Tristen screams) "Stop it!"

1169
01:23:33,972 --> 01:23:36,975
"Tristen!"
"No! No!"

1170
01:23:37,058 --> 01:23:38,601
"Stop! Oh... "

1171
01:23:38,768 --> 01:23:40,562
(Jeff) "She's the witch, man!"

1172
01:23:40,645 --> 01:23:43,523
"Jeff, what are you saying?
I'm not the witch. "

1173
01:23:43,606 --> 01:23:45,859
"Yeah, you are. "
"What are you saying?"

1174
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:48,361
You know what I'm saying,
goddamn it!

1175
01:23:48,445 --> 01:23:50,196
(Tristen) "Stephen, please. "

1176
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:54,409
(Stephen) "Did you kill Erica?
Confess, confess. "

1177
01:23:54,492 --> 01:23:56,494
"Stop it. "
"Say the words. "

1178
01:23:56,578 --> 01:23:59,456
"Oh, God, Stephen, don't! Please!"

1179
01:23:59,539 --> 01:24:01,458
"No!"

1180
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,253
"Fucking witch!"

1181
01:24:06,546 --> 01:24:08,381
This is wrong.

1182
01:24:17,557 --> 01:24:19,351
This is wrong.

1183
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:21,853
Somebody fucked with this tape!

1184
01:24:22,812 --> 01:24:24,898
Somebody fucked with that tape!

1185
01:24:25,732 --> 01:24:27,567
That tape is wrong!

1186
01:24:27,692 --> 01:24:29,819
That's fucking bullshit!

1187
01:24:32,989 --> 01:24:35,450
(Sobbing) That's fucking shit!
