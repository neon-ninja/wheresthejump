1
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,640
Bjorling...

2
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,970
Suliotis?

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,810
Almost. Bjorling is easy.

4
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,650
Tebaldi?

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,990
Bingo!

6
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,220
It's my turn now.

7
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,630
- Don't look!
- But I'm not looking.

8
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,190
Did Daddy look?

9
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,360
Is that true?

10
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,950
Oh, God!

11
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,390
Gigli!

12
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,400
That's obvious!
But what's the piece?

13
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,880
Never heard it!

14
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,610
Is it new?

15
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,110
Seems to be.

16
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,950
Well, darling?

17
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,070
I'd say Handel.

18
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,500
Right. But what is it?

19
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,000
No idea!

20
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,540
Well?

21
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,950
I give up. What is it?

22
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,820
Three-two to me!

23
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,060
So, what is it?

24
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,390
Now get your hands off!

25
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,400
Just listen!

26
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,160
That's cheating!

27
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,220
Sorry?

28
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,290
It's cheating to be practicing.

29
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,530
We've booked for 10:00
tomorrow morning. You are coming?

30
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,940
Yes, sure.

31
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,940
We'll put the boat in the water first.

32
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,950
Can you give us a hand?
Let's say, in 20 minutes?

33
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,230
Sure! Yes, I'll be there in 20 minutes.

34
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,130
Okay. Thanks.

35
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,690
See you in a tick.

36
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,810
What's up with him?

37
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,040
No idea.

38
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,600
He seems in a huff.

39
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,840
She didn't say a word.

40
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,080
Who did you arrange
to play with tomorrow?

41
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,490
Her.

42
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,920
Yesterday?

43
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,650
The day before.

44
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,660
Well?

45
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,160
Nothing. She was totally normal.

46
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,560
Sissi isn't there.

47
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,620
Maybe she was just in the house.
Or at the beach.

48
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,470
Who were the two laddies?

49
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,300
How should I know?

50
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,310
They're probably relatives.
I think his brother has a son that age.

51
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,810
Don't put that there!
Take your things upstairs!

52
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:37,880
Okay.

53
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,290
Do it now!

54
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,190
Don't leave things in the entrance,
or someone will trip over.

55
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,760
There's still so much left in the car.

56
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,830
Are you listening?

57
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,770
I'm going!

58
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,270
Open the windows, will you.
We need to let some air in.

59
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,280
Okay, Mom!

60
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,880
Stop it, Rolfi! Stop it!

61
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,790
Go on, get down!

62
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,720
I have to unpack!

63
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,830
Go on, get out!

64
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,800
- Georg?
- Yes?

65
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,730
Where's the other box
with the food?

66
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,240
I'll bring it right away.

67
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,330
The golf gear was in the way.
I put it in the Rover last.

68
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,450
We'd better get them in quick!
The things have got really hot!

69
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,510
This cool-box is totally useless.

70
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,750
Stop it now, you'll knock me over.

71
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,550
- The butter's all soft.
- Go see your mistress.

72
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,890
There're some cold cuts in the other box.

73
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,090
I'll get it. I'll just open the windows.

74
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,600
Leave the shutters closed on the lake side,
or it'll be too hot.

75
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,390
Stop that. You'll get something

76
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,670
in a minute, I must just put this away.

77
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,910
Can't you call the dog?
He won't let me put the things away.

78
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,410
Rolfi!

79
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,510
Come here!

80
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,750
Come and see your master!

81
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,650
And the bottles too,
otherwise it'll all be warm by the evening.

82
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,990
Stop it, Rolfi!

83
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,550
Be quiet!

84
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,790
Come in!

85
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,800
Sorry. He's off his head.

86
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,360
Come in!

87
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,640
Hello.

88
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,540
Thanks for coming.
It'd have been tough on our own.

89
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,450
- No problem! This is...
- Paul. Nice to meet you.

90
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,250
Paul is son of a business colleague.

91
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,650
- It's a pleasure. Nice of you to help.
- Mine too.

92
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,380
I mean, the pleasure's mine.

93
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,620
- Not so much his.
- Will you be quiet?

94
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,850
Lunatic!

95
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,400
- Get into the house, go on!
- Come here, Rolfi!

96
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,700
- When did you get out here?
- Last week.

97
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,030
You too?

98
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,540
- Yes.
- No.

99
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,340
They didn't arrive till the weekend.
We came on Friday.

100
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,510
Hello, Fred!

101
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,670
Nice of you to come over right away.

102
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,180
- How's Eva?
- Fine.

103
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,720
- Hello.
- Hello, madam.

104
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,250
...and where's Tropea?

105
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,390
In south Italy. Right at the tip,

106
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,450
- almost on the toes of the boot.
- But it's even hotter there.

107
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,190
Not necessarily.

108
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,580
Last year when I was in Italy it was freezing

109
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,430
and here you were swimming, right?

110
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,310
But it's a shame Sissi isn't here.
Without her, it's...

111
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,710
- Be careful!
- I am!

112
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,110
Careful, or the overhauling
will have been for nothing.

113
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,170
Look, you can't see anything!

114
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,240
Good.

115
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,280
Can you help me lift the boom over?

116
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,650
Mind the halyard!

117
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,000
But she said she'd be there
for the whole holiday.

118
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,250
Listen, my boy.
I don't know why she isn't there either.

119
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,850
Maybe she went to Tropea
with a school friend. I don't know.

120
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,220
Tomorrow we'll go over and ask
her mother. She's bound to explain all.

121
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,950
Now stop moping...

122
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,190
Why was Uncle Fred so strange?

123
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,430
I'm not surprised!

124
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,090
She got pretty worked up
about it last time.

125
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,470
Forget it, please.

126
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,400
She won't change,
and you'll just get in a state.

127
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,510
Exactly!

128
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,880
That's it!

129
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,880
Great. They're outside
working on the boat.

130
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,650
What?

131
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,630
5:00 or 5:30.
I don't know the time here,

132
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,530
I mean, the kitchen clock has stopped.

133
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,790
I must get a new battery on Monday.

134
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,070
What?

135
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,900
Yes, that's what I'm doing now.

136
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,370
Some fillets.

137
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,270
Yes, you know, it's crazy. The whole thing

138
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,040
defrosted and now it needs eating.

139
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,940
Come out and see us!

140
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,010
No, really, like a fool, I froze
three pounds of beef fillet at once,

141
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,250
and now here I am.

142
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,890
No, I'm not joking.
Come and spend the weekend.

143
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,660
What?

144
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,200
He shouldn't make such a fuss.
Hold on.

145
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,030
We need a sharp knife.

146
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,630
I'd like to see it again some day.
Tell Dad.

147
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,040
Sorry.

148
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,600
Tell your beloved to pack up his laptop,

149
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,840
get in the car, and you'll be here
in two hours at the most!

150
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,650
He shouldn't be so elusive.

151
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,920
Okay. Think about it.

152
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,390
In any case,
there's enough steak here for a week.

153
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,590
Bye, Fanny.

154
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,830
Say, give us another ring anyway

155
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,500
to tell us whether we can expect you.

156
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,060
Yes, bye.

157
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,440
- What is it now?
- Someone's here.

158
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,440
- Where?
- At the door.

159
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,950
Hello?

160
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,150
Hello. Sorry to disturb you.

161
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,740
I'm from next door.

162
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,720
We saw each other
when you stopped the car at the gate.

163
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,450
Oh, yes, we did.

164
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,260
Come in, please.

165
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,090
Hurry up, we're eating in 10 minutes!

166
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,660
So what is it?

167
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,230
Well...

168
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,970
Eva sent...

169
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,030
I mean, Mrs. Berlinger sent me.

170
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,600
She's just cooking...

171
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:23,650
and she's run out of eggs.
She wonders if you can help her out.

172
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,480
But of course.

173
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,280
- How many does she need?
- Four.

174
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,010
Four?

175
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,020
- What for?
- Sorry?

176
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,580
What for?

177
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,650
What does she need the eggs for?

178
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,390
I mean, what's she making?

179
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,460
No idea.

180
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,360
Are they okay like that
or shall I wrap them?

181
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,530
As you like.

182
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,040
So how did you get in?

183
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,600
At the front.
I mean, by the beach.

184
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,840
But you didn't get wet at all!

185
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,410
There's a hole in the fence,

186
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,970
by the water, not in the water.

187
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,250
Fred knows -

188
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,590
I mean, Mr. Berlinger knows it.
He showed me it.

189
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,020
I see. Okay.

190
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,720
So, wrapped, or is this okay?

191
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,730
No, no, that's fine, no problem.

192
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,760
- Many thanks.
- You're welcome.

193
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,160
Love to Eva.
Look forward to the golf tomorrow!

194
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,100
I'll tell her. Thanks again.

195
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,660
And thanks again to Fred
and your friend -

196
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,230
- Damn it!
- What's up?

197
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,880
It's not a disaster.

198
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,620
Hang on.

199
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,970
Thank God, we just arrived...

200
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,300
and I must shop
in the village on Monday.

201
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,940
I'm really embarrassed.

202
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,510
It's nothing. No one here eats eggs
for breakfast anyway,

203
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,580
so it's not a major problem.

204
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,590
That's a relief, thank you.

205
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,250
I should just have been more careful.

206
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,930
- I put my left hand -
- Well, no point in crying over spilt milk.

207
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,330
You're really kind.

208
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,160
One does one's best.

209
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,630
I'm really sorry.

210
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,580
I'm very clumsy, you know.

211
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,360
I think I've got two left hands.

212
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,760
So you're ideal for carrying eggs.

213
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,760
Yes, you could say.

214
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,030
Well...

215
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,570
And what are we going to do now?

216
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,240
We do have steak,
but we might be getting visitors,

217
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,750
and they're bound to want eggs
for breakfast.

218
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,780
But you'll have four left.

219
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,280
After all, I did see
you had a box of twelve, right?

220
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,760
You're right.

221
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,540
Shouldn't I wrap them up?

222
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,270
No need.

223
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,510
Are you sure?

224
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,410
If you want to.

225
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,150
If I want to?

226
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,280
Well, maybe it is better after all.

227
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,590
- Oh, no!
- What's the matter?

228
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,420
Oh, no!

229
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,190
I'm sorry.

230
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,170
Before you destroy the rest of the kitchen,

231
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,700
maybe you should take your eggs and leave.

232
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,040
Well...

233
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,880
Here you are.

234
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,550
Won't you wrap them?

235
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,670
I'm really sorry.

236
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,000
Honestly.

237
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,570
Me too.

238
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,550
There.

239
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,290
- Here you are.
- Many thanks. Thank you.

240
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,330
I'll tell Mrs. Berlinger how nice you were.

241
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,460
Okay. Do as you see fit.

242
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,690
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

243
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,200
Excuse me?

244
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,050
Stop it! Rolfi!

245
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,610
Excuse me!

246
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,360
Off you go!

247
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,090
Get lost!

248
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,000
I mean now!

249
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,940
I'm sorry. He's completely harmless.

250
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,500
- He just wants to have a game.
- Funny game.

251
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,840
Did he hurt you?

252
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,570
Peter's just afraid of dogs.

253
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,840
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

254
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,910
He jumped up on me.

255
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,650
I'm sorry about that.

256
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,380
Well.

257
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,450
Shall I lock him in so you can leave?

258
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,550
- No need.
- I can tell my husband to -

259
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,620
There's really no need, thanks.

260
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,390
It's my fault.
I quite forgot the dog.

261
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,590
Otherwise, I'd have come to fetch the...

262
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh! What a wonderful kit!

263
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,730
Gallaway, isn't it?

264
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,640
It's fantastic.

265
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,270
May I?

266
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,510
We hardly stand a chance for tomorrow!

267
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,150
Good clubs don't make good golfers.

268
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,480
That's true, yes.

269
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,060
Would it be cheeky of me
to ask if I can try it just once?

270
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,220
Right now, outside?

271
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,560
Please! Okay?

272
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,630
From the lawn out to the lake, okay?

273
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,340
- If it makes you happy. I -
- Thanks.

274
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,100
Excuse me.

275
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,510
He loves golf!

276
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,550
- We both do.
- Sorry?

277
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,450
Both of us. We both love golf.

278
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,870
Rolfi!

279
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,530
Stop it!

280
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,270
Rolfi!

281
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,010
Be quiet now!

282
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,850
What's up?

283
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,750
I don't know,
probably it's too hot for him too.

284
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,430
I'll go and see.

285
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,960
Brilliant!

286
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,360
Like the difference
between day and night.

287
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,260
Thanks very much.

288
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,820
You're welcome.

289
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,440
Where's Tom?

290
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,670
- Who?
- Did you give him the eggs?

291
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,270
Sorry?

292
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,750
The driver is absolutely top-class.

293
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,150
You must try it.

294
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,380
Listen, young man.

295
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,510
I don't know what game you're playing,
but I'm not going to join in.

296
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,320
Will you go now, please?

297
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,960
What game?

298
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,670
Sorry, madam, but I don't understand

299
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,300
why you're suddenly so unfriendly.

300
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,140
Have Tom or I
done anything to annoy you?

301
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,150
Please, would you leave?

302
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,450
Did you behave badly while I was outside?

303
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,050
Was he cheeky?

304
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,990
- Did he say anything -
- That's enough.

305
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,190
I asked you to leave, so...

306
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,930
please go.

307
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,160
Okay.

308
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,560
I don't understand what's upset you so,
but if you insist...

309
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,300
Fine.

310
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,110
Give the eggs to Tom
and we won't bother you again.

311
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,840
I'm sorry?

312
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,410
Of course we'll be telling Eva and Fred.

313
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,850
Honestly, I've never experienced
anything like it before.

314
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,350
What about you, Tom?

315
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,730
May we have the eggs now, please?

316
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,970
I told you to leave!

317
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,970
Did I do something wrong...

318
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,030
Now just get out of here, you...

319
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,100
Is the dog with you?
What's going on?

320
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,340
- Get them out!
- Good to see you, Mr. Schober.

321
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,900
You are Mr. Schober, right?

322
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,970
Fred, I mean, Mr. Berlinger told me.

323
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,350
What?
What's the matter?

324
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,910
- Throw him out!
- Your wife's mistaken.

325
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,650
I'm very glad you're here.

326
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,890
I'm sure you can clarify
the misunderstanding.

327
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,950
- Daddy, I can't -
- Please, Georg!

328
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,900
It's outrageous!

329
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,670
Can I explain how this
misunderstanding arose?

330
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,910
Mrs. Berlinger sent me over
to fetch some eggs.

331
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,470
So what? And then?

332
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,880
Your wife gave the eggs to Peter,
but he smashed them.

333
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,050
Yes. And she gave me
four more eggs, but...

334
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,280
then the dog jumped up on me...

335
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,850
and now...

336
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,760
But it was a 12-pack,
and you're shopping Monday anyway...

337
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,820
We just want the eggs,

338
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,390
that's all.

339
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,230
Can you tell me what's going on?

340
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,140
Give them the eggs.

341
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,380
Hold on!
Can you wait a moment?

342
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,480
- Can I take them?
- Just a moment.

343
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,220
What's going on?

344
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,780
It can't just be about these ridiculous eggs.
Why this rage?

345
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,350
I'm not justifying myself to these...

346
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:58,160
I asked you to throw them out.
I must have my reasons.

347
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,840
Do as you wish.
For me, the subject is closed.

348
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,070
Anna?

349
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,110
Would you please leave?

350
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,780
My wife doesn't feel well.

351
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,690
I can't act as arbitrator in a matter
I don't know anything about.

352
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,420
Please, would you leave?

353
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,930
What is it?

354
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,490
If you don't mind?

355
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,640
So give them to him!

356
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,370
What's going on?

357
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,440
Nothing's going on.

358
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,850
She gave him the eggs,
the dog jumped on him, he smashed them.

359
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,250
He wants more.
Is it so complicated?

360
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,150
What kind of tone is that supposed to be?

361
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,490
Watch I don't smash your balls as well!

362
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,160
Now get out! Right now!

363
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,260
Is it broken?

364
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,780
Be good, now.

365
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,340
Behave yourself!

366
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,110
Be nice!

367
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,180
I don't want to hurt you,
but behave yourself!

368
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,400
Please stay where you are.

369
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,950
Please stay there!

370
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,330
- He hit me in the face.
- Yes. He started it.

371
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,660
You can help him if you want,
but no messing about.

372
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,840
- Bring him a chair.
- My knee!

373
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,910
- He should take off his pants and sit down.
- A chair!

374
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,480
Peter studies medicine. He'll fix it.

375
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,720
Take off your pants, please.

376
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,900
If you won't let me see your wound,
I can't help you.

377
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,240
Sorry I hurt you,

378
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,210
but you left me no choice,
you must admit.

379
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,610
Be reasonable, Mr. Schober.
Let him look at your leg.

380
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,510
He's sure to be able to help.

381
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,650
Will you leave please?

382
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,920
Please!

383
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,920
This won't get us anywhere.

384
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,830
You must let him help you.
You haven't any choice.

385
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,790
You're a ship's captain, sir.

386
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,870
You know that on board ship,
the Captain's word is final.

387
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,530
So, what do you want to do, sir?

388
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,040
Do you want to call someone?
An ambulance?

389
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,600
Or the police?

390
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,680
Go on! I won't stop you.
Nor will Tom.

391
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,480
That's a promise!

392
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,210
Right?

393
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,190
What are you waiting for?

394
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,100
He dropped the mobile in the water.

395
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,810
Why are you doing this?

396
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,380
Why not?

397
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,750
Okay, then, another game.

398
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,400
A guessing game.

399
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,420
What's this?

400
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,510
A golf ball.

401
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,110
Exactly, sir, a golf ball.

402
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,350
And why do I have it here in my pocket?

403
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,360
The lady knows.

404
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,090
Because...

405
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,860
Well?

406
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,000
Well?

407
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,440
- Because you didn't hit it.
- Exactly!

408
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,670
And why didn't I hit it?

409
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,150
Because you were stopped.

410
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,210
Exactly.

411
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,780
And because I had to test
the club another way.

412
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,030
Where is he?

413
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,430
Cold.

414
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,830
Cold.

415
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,170
Colder.

416
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,840
Cold.

417
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,990
Warmer.

418
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,470
Hotter.

419
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,870
Cold.

420
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,430
Really cold.

421
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,840
Warmer, hotter, boiling!

422
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,670
Would you kindly get me
some food from the kitchen?

423
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,340
Would it be possible?

424
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,650
Bananas or something like that.

425
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,490
And don't think of picking up
a knife or something.

426
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,400
I'd be sorry if you did.

427
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,960
For your sake.

428
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,480
The sun's coming out again.

429
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,680
Very kind of you. Thank you.

430
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,040
Hello! Sweetie!

431
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,950
Where are you?

432
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,390
Come on down!

433
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,560
We're both thinking the same, aren't we?

434
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,960
We saw your boat!

435
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,510
Hello, Gerda!
Hello, Robert!

436
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,240
How long have you been here?

437
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,800
Not long.

438
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,820
We're still unpacking.

439
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,980
How long are you staying?

440
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,890
A week or two.

441
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,620
We're not sure yet.

442
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,020
Great!

443
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,860
- Hello, darling, lovely to see you.
- Hello.

444
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,600
Have you met my sister?

445
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,110
No! Pleased to meet you!

446
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,330
Hello, Robert!

447
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,140
- Everything okay?
- Of course.

448
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,020
This is Paul.
He's living with our neighbors.

449
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,420
- Hello, Paul!
- Hello, pleased to meet you!

450
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,420
Are you cold?

451
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,150
No, I have eczema.

452
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,390
You should go swimming.
The water here does wonders for you.

453
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,790
Thank you for the tip.

454
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,230
Hello.

455
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,270
How's Georg?

456
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,490
Very well, thank you!

457
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,060
So where is he?

458
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,470
He pulled a muscle putting the mast up.

459
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,030
So he's lying down.

460
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,600
That's a real shame.

461
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,840
That's the result of doing
everything yourself.

462
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,320
Robert wouldn't dream of putting our boat

463
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,250
in the water on his own, right?

464
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,450
Tell your beloved to pull
himself together.

465
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,520
We barbecue nearly every night.
We can't do without him.

466
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,250
I'll tell him!

467
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,660
I mean it. As soon as he's better,
come and see us right away.

468
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:51,130
Robert's son is here with his girlfriend.
He'll like her.

469
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,300
Right then.

470
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,100
Have a good time, darling.

471
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,510
If the wind doesn't change, bring the car.

472
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,550
The weather forecast says wind.

473
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,670
For tomorrow.

474
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,410
- I said to Robert we'd get nowhere.
- Where are you moored?

475
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,980
What?

476
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,790
Oh! Over there,
behind the headland.

477
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,020
But on the other side.

478
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,190
- The wooden house covered in ivy?
- That's it.

479
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,360
- It looks very pretty.
- Indeed it is, young man.

480
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,270
Right then. Bye!

481
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,300
- Are you staying all week?
- This week, sure.

482
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,980
Might see you tonight!

483
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,990
As you like.
We're always pleased to see you!

484
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,390
I don't know yet.

485
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,790
- We'll see how Georg is.
- Yes, you see! See you soon!

486
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,960
They'll be here
in two hours at the latest...

487
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,870
and then this farce will be over.

488
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,770
Sorry, but that's not quite true.

489
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,140
I heard the end of your phone call.

490
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,150
You asked your friends to call you back
if they were coming tonight.

491
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,740
Or did I misunderstand you?

492
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,310
Even if they can't reach us,
they'll still come.

493
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,010
Is lying allowed?

494
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,410
Just a moment!

495
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,620
There you are. Please.

496
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,300
You really can speak to us openly.

497
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:23,200
You'll feel much better.
We're also being very open with you.

498
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,710
Perhaps try putting a cushion under it.

499
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,910
If you'd accepted Peter's help,
it would be hurting less.

500
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,250
I'm quite willing to help you.

501
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,490
But I don't want to impose.

502
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,190
Careful!

503
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,730
Yes, raise the leg.
That's bound to be more comfortable.

504
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,740
There we are! Done!

505
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,910
Can you leave it out, you bastards?

506
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,110
Is that an offer?

507
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,680
- What?
- Using our first names?

508
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,360
I'm very happy about that.

509
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:16,370
It does vastly simplify our communication.

510
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,700
I'd still like to apologize for just now,

511
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,710
for being too familiar,

512
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,560
but you must admit that the smack was

513
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,870
an unreasonable reaction nonetheless.

514
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,080
Paul.

515
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,880
This is Peter.

516
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,090
Come here, Tom.
Have you no manners?

517
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,820
Give Georg your hand.

518
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,560
Here, it's for the pain.

519
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,160
What? To you, we're non-existent?

520
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,570
- Being on familiar terms doesn't mean -
- You bastard...

521
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,760
Quiet! Please!

522
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,990
Stop!

523
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:18,330
Stop it now, otherwise your mother
will get it, do you understand?

524
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,660
Understand?

525
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,040
Keep quiet now.

526
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,220
What a scene,
just for being on first-name terms!

527
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,280
We were only trying to improve relations.

528
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,450
- I thought we could -
- Why are you doing that?

529
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,120
Fatty, why are you doing that?

530
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,350
Go on, tell us!

531
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,930
I don't know. I...

532
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,490
The Captain wants to know.

533
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,400
Why?

534
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,040
Well?

535
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,770
It's difficult to talk about it. I...

536
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,340
Don't be shy.

537
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,050
You know just how hard it is...

538
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,420
My God, what a fuss!

539
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,860
His father got a divorce...

540
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,420
when he was still that tiny,

541
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,730
- and he took another woman -
- That's not true!

542
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,290
He's lying!

543
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,430
It was my mother who divorced...

544
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,640
because...

545
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,300
because...

546
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,150
I...

547
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:09,060
Because she wanted to have
her little teddy all to herself,

548
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,460
and since then,
he's been a queer and a crook.

549
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,090
You see?

550
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,200
You're an asshole!

551
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:21,710
The truth is, he comes from
a filthy, deprived family,

552
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,280
he has five brothers and sisters

553
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,010
who are all drug addicts.

554
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,670
His dad's an alcoholic,

555
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,690
and as for his mother,
you can imagine.

556
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,250
Or rather, the truth is,
it's him who fucks her.

557
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,080
Tough,

558
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,650
but true.

559
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,300
Come on, calm down now.

560
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,460
You're disgusting. Can't you cut out

561
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,770
your obscenities in front of the child?

562
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,170
Oh! Sorry.

563
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,110
Of course.
What answer would you like?

564
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,840
What would satisfy you?

565
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,450
Anyway, what I said isn't true.
You know that as well as I.

566
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,950
Look at him.

567
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:07,660
Do you really think he comes from
a deprived background?

568
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,830
Right.

569
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,160
He's a spoiled little shit-face,

570
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,430
tormented by ennui and world-weariness,

571
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,470
weighed down by the void of existence!

572
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,010
That's hard, honestly!

573
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,950
You see, he's smiling again.

574
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,130
Right.

575
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,030
Satisfied?

576
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,190
Or another version?

577
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,770
I'm hungry.

578
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,010
I'll see what there is.

579
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,550
You see, the truth is,
he's a drug addict.

580
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,220
That's why he's going now, and...

581
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,600
That's why he has bad nerves, you see.

582
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,500
Me too, I'm a drug addict.

583
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:19,600
Together we rob rich families
in smart houses

584
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,010
so we can afford the stuff.

585
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,120
Can you stop this lunacy?

586
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,550
I get the message,

587
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,920
isn't that enough for you?

588
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,750
You get the message?

589
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,990
Great!

590
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,360
Fatty! He's got it!

591
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,160
Now he knows everything!

592
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,500
That's fantastic, really.

593
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,770
Listen.

594
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,330
Peter, come in here!

595
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,710
Listen, we're going to bet, okay?

596
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,380
Sit down, come on!

597
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,550
- It's dark in here.
- Now don't fall asleep!

598
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,520
We'll bet that -

599
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,080
What's the time?

600
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,030
Twenty to 9:00.

601
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,930
That in, let's say, 12 hours...

602
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,800
all three of you'll be kaput.

603
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,240
What?

604
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,930
You bet us, that tomorrow at 9:00,
you'll be alive,

605
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,840
and we bet you,
you'll be dead, okay?

606
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,660
They don't want to bet.

607
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,540
That's no good. You have to bet.

608
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,400
What do you think?
Do you think they've a chance of winning?

609
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,740
You are on their side, aren't you?

610
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,470
So, who will you bet with?

611
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,210
What kind of bet is this?

612
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,250
Dead, they can give nothing,
and conversely, they can win nothing.

613
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,790
They'll lose in any case. Obviously.

614
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,340
Stop this nonsense.

615
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,650
Are you trying to scare us?

616
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,820
Isn't what you've done already enough?

617
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,490
What do you want? Our money?

618
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,230
Help yourselves and get out.

619
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:15,230
Don't you think Fred and Eva
might come and see what's going on?

620
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,900
And give us a good hiding, right?

621
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,140
Okay.

622
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,710
As they say on TV:

623
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,450
The bets are placed!

624
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,460
And what'll we do now?

625
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,320
Could you kindly make us some food?

626
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,660
You worry me, Fatty.

627
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,560
Can't you control yourself?

628
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,570
You've just gobbled up the sausage.

629
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,230
It's disgusting.

630
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,800
What are these people going to think?

631
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,710
I haven't eaten since lunchtime!

632
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,680
And stop calling me Fatty.

633
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,870
- Okay, Tom.
- Okay, Jerry.

634
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:57,320
But can't you pay some attention
to your appearance?

635
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,320
You think it makes you more attractive?

636
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,320
Look at the Captain's wife.

637
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,320
Do you think she finds you attractive?

638
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,290
- With your flab?
- Stop it!

639
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,600
Look at her.

640
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,160
She's not as old as all that.

641
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,830
Excuse me, madam.

642
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,680
You'd be quite acceptable to her,

643
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,910
but with that figure of yours!

644
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,350
Follow her example.

645
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,750
Her body's really in shape.

646
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,520
Not a single extra calorie!

647
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,160
I'm not so sure!

648
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,230
What?

649
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,030
Did you hear that, madam?

650
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,200
That's really cheeky!

651
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:45,240
We can't put up with that, can we?

652
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,680
Hey you! Indian!

653
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,180
What's your name anyway?

654
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:03,960
Georg.

655
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,720
Like Daddy.

656
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,100
Lovely!

657
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,770
Georgie-boy, come over to me.

658
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,830
Come here.

659
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,710
Come on. Sit down beside me.
We're going to play a game.

660
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:23,770
Let the boy go!

661
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:27,990
I know you don't want to play,
but you'll see, it's fun.

662
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,720
Let the boy go!

663
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,690
See how your mother's
standing up for you?

664
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:37,700
- Dad could take an example from her!
- Stop it!

665
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:40,430
For that we're going
to let your mom play with us.

666
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,330
Hold Georgie a moment.

667
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,340
We're playing a nice little game:
Kitten in the Bag.

668
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,840
You'll see, it's fun.

669
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:57,190
There! Don't panic! Nothing will happen.

670
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:59,450
I said this is a nice game.

671
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:00,980
A family game.

672
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:04,960
Daddy is playing too
so he doesn't get bored.

673
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,020
Right. Now listen!

674
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,860
You'll have to keep still, or it's no fun.

675
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,870
Hey! Listen now!

676
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,300
That's right, Georgie.

677
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:19,110
We'll work together, okay?

678
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,590
The pillow case isn't uncomfortable, is it?

679
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,110
You've enough air, haven't you?

680
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,560
You've enough air, haven't you?

681
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:29,460
Yes.

682
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:31,220
Great. Then we can finally start.

683
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,730
So, the starting point of our game

684
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,960
was that mommy and our little Indian
wanted to slip out of here.

685
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,010
- But why?
- Don't know.

686
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:41,730
Is lying allowed, Fatty?

687
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,740
What an example you're setting!
You know why.

688
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,470
You mentioned her flab.

689
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,950
What do you mean, me?

690
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,180
It was you who doubted her flawlessness!

691
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,050
Okay. Forget it!

692
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,390
I understand too how it embarrassed her.
With the boy here.

693
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,320
That's why we play
"Kitten in the Bag. "

694
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,300
To preserve moral decency.

695
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,360
The kiddy wears a pillow case
While mummy strips off, in great haste!

696
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,130
We mustn't hurt the kitty cat, right?
Dad's broken leg is enough.

697
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,040
Let the child go. Please!

698
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,170
Exactly. Daddy's playing with us too.

699
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,480
What are we waiting for?

700
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,590
Tell your wife not to be so shy.
It's ridiculous.

701
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,530
Anyway, I'm sure she isn't flabby.

702
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,690
Please, let the child go.

703
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,870
Please!

704
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,730
You only have to say to her,
"Get undressed. "

705
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,480
I beg you!

706
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,310
"Get undressed, my darling. "

707
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,130
Get undressed.

708
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,640
"Get undressed, my darling. "

709
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,480
Get undressed, my darling.

710
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,420
Well done.

711
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,180
What did I say? Not an ounce of flab.

712
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,920
Now, let's get dressed again.

713
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:33,830
Fatty, can you take the little piggy?

714
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,060
He isn't quite potty-trained.

715
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,970
Go and clean him up.

716
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,700
- Let the child go!
- I won't do anything to him.

717
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,660
Will you sit down, please?

718
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,340
I'd advise you not to kick me.

719
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,350
I hope you won't be
too bored with these two.

720
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,890
Pour a pan of water over his head.

721
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,450
But make sure you don't ruin the carpet.

722
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:29,560
No, no, of course that was a joke.

723
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,970
I have to retake Latin in the autumn.

724
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:36,370
If I pass it, then things will get moving.
I'll study commercial law.

725
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,600
But before that there's military service.

726
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,110
Does it hurt a lot?

727
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,840
Why don't you kill us right away?

728
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,230
Don't forget the entertainment value.

729
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,040
We'd all be deprived of our pleasure.

730
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,980
Sorry about your leg.

731
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,320
But it's your fault, if I might say so.

732
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:53,830
Why did you smack Paul?

733
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:01,030
For me, begging for the eggs
to no avail was very unpleasant.

734
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,330
Humiliating, actually.

735
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,070
I don't know if you realize that.

736
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,540
It's just not worth it,

737
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:12,100
all this charade, for a box of eggs.

738
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:19,380
They should still be there.

739
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,290
You should have trusted
what your wife said.

740
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,020
She really begged you just
to let us leave with the eggs.

741
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,260
Naturally one's always wiser
after the event.

742
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:32,230
Ah! There they are!

743
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,730
One of them is cracked.

744
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:40,470
It's not bad, what these boxes withstand.
When you think-

745
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,580
Why are you doing that?

746
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:45,640
How stupid do you think I am?

747
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,380
I don't understand. You're really
forcing me to treat you badly.

748
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,060
Jesus! That's it! You've done it now!

749
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,970
And Paul even said
we should take care of the carpet!

750
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,140
Please, let us go!

751
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:14,320
You're so young still!

752
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:18,320
You have all your life before you!

753
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,720
Nothing's happened yet!

754
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:26,430
We'll say...

755
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,530
that Georg broke his leg in the boat.

756
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:32,800
- Everyone'll believe it, and -
- Please stop.

757
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:34,540
Why are you humiliating yourself?

758
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:36,670
It's just as unpleasant for me as for you.

759
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:15,810
Georgie?

760
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:18,800
Where are you?

761
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:45,820
Georgie!

762
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:47,380
I'm coming!

763
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,690
Hold on,
I'll put on some music for us.

764
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,080
Don't come any closer!

765
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:33,040
The trigger!

766
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:36,990
You have to prime the trigger!

767
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,000
And you need to pull it too!

768
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,840
Tralee trala, here we are!

769
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,540
Mommy!

770
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,210
Hello, my darling!

771
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:08,410
Is everything okay?

772
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:13,790
They've -

773
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,730
They've killed Sissi!

774
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,920
- Hi, Beavis!
- Hi, Butt-Head!

775
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,870
- Everything under control?
- Looks like it.

776
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:25,800
May I?

777
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,540
Please. Sure.

778
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:31,880
You must wonder, Captain,
where this lovely rifle comes from.

779
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,940
Or does it seem familiar?

780
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:37,650
Haven't you ever been hunting with Fred?

781
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:42,990
Do you know, your little darling
just tried to kill me with it?

782
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,160
Scarcely believable, but it's the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

783
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,730
Isn't that right, Georgie?

784
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,510
What do you say, Tom?

785
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,910
Dreadful.

786
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:03,510
What's the time?

787
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:06,250
Just after 11:00.

788
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,290
We should start thinking about our bet,
don't you think?

789
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:15,120
Actually we ought to be grateful
to Georgie for helping us.

790
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,130
One for Beavis,

791
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,960
one for Butt-Head.

792
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:25,640
A, B, BOO and out go you!

793
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:30,170
You're not leaving at this stage.
First you'll have to say your age.

794
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,250
Well?

795
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:39,450
She doesn't want to play.

796
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,050
Well, how old do you think she is?

797
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:45,560
37?

798
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:49,300
No flab...

799
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,500
So I'd say,

800
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:54,060
let's be generous,
let's say 35.

801
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:57,310
Agreed?

802
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,480
She agrees.

803
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:03,540
Who are you going to start counting with?

804
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,190
Her?

805
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,150
And now I'm going to
get myself something to eat.

806
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:15,490
One, two, three,

807
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:17,660
four, five, six, seven...

808
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,120
Can I get anyone anything?

809
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,730
You're an idiot, Fatty.

810
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,240
You don't shoot the person you've

811
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,170
counted out, but the one that's left over!

812
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,570
What's wrong with you?

813
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,800
- He tried to escape!
- So what?

814
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:24,040
That's no reason
to get trigger-happy.

815
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,600
Have you no sense of timing?

816
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:27,940
What's the time?

817
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,780
Just before 12:00.

818
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,340
Shit.

819
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,080
We'll get nothing from the others now.

820
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,090
- Let's get out of here.
- Fine.

821
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:41,120
Thanks so much for the driver.
I'll put it back in the bag, okay?

822
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,190
Thanks.

823
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:44,820
So, have a good evening!

824
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,230
Good-bye!

825
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,600
Bye!

826
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,630
They've gone.

827
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:53,670
Do you hear? They've gone!

828
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:39,720
I'll get a knife.

829
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,750
Come on.
Calm down now.

830
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:38,560
Take deep breaths.

831
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:43,630
Come on, darling.

832
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:46,570
Calm down now.

833
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,080
Calm yourself.

834
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:54,920
Calm yourself.

835
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:57,820
That's it. Take some deep breaths.

836
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:55,150
We've got to get out of here.

837
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:59,050
What if they come back?

838
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:04,160
Do you think you can walk
if I support you?

839
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,590
I'll try.

840
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:22,780
What's wrong with your arm?

841
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,620
Shall I try and make a splint for it?
Then I can hold you better.

842
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:36,460
No, it's okay. Come on.

843
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:02,920
Let's go.

844
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:11,500
Let's go.

845
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:22,780
Okay?

846
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,460
No! Anna!

847
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,870
No!

848
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,790
They've locked the door.

849
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,590
We must use the window.

850
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:31,150
I can't.

851
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:32,720
Georg!

852
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,130
- Please!
- I can't manage it.

853
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,360
You go.

854
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:39,930
It's crazy wasting so much time.
Run for it. Please!

855
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:41,840
Climb out of the kitchen window.

856
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:44,070
Try to get as far as the inn, or...

857
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:46,640
If we're locked in here,
the gate will be shut too.

858
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,250
That's true.

859
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,750
Take a pair of pliers and cut the fence.

860
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:57,760
But careful on the road.
Maybe they're waiting out there.

861
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:01,290
Where are the pliers?

862
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:06,060
I don't know.

863
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,130
Here, in the kitchen.

864
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:11,630
No,

865
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:13,240
down at the boat shed.

866
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,440
I can't leave you alone here.

867
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,010
Go now, please!

868
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:21,510
Put some clothes on.

869
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:24,080
And shoes too, so you can run.

870
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,930
Hold on, the bag's still here.

871
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,490
Down there.

872
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,050
I'll hide down in the wine cellar.

873
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,550
The key must be in the door.

874
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:55,320
I'll shut myself in
and wait for you to come back.

875
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,660
How will you get down there?

876
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:04,220
I'll manage.

877
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:22,390
Go now! Please!

878
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:45,080
The mobile! It's working again!

879
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:46,080
What?

880
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:48,640
It's working!
It's obviously dried out.

881
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,880
- So get on the phone!
- Who to?

882
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,450
Anyone! The police!

883
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:55,190
What's their number?

884
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,920
No idea.

885
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:58,390
Call my mother...

886
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:00,400
Your father-
No, wait...

887
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:03,130
Call Peter, he's at home,
I know, he wanted to -

888
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,870
Press four and then hit speed-dial.

889
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:10,200
It's not ringing.

890
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:14,200
Let me listen.

891
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:18,720
But there is a signal!

892
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:20,950
Some of the contacts
are probably still damp.

893
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:40,970
Nothing.

894
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:45,810
Get the hair dryer.
Maybe it'll help.

895
01:16:46,650 --> 01:16:48,810
Can you pass me the chair?

896
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:17,450
It won't work.

897
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,760
Leave it, come on.

898
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:06,010
Maybe it's permanently broken.

899
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,570
Get going!

900
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:13,740
We're wasting far too much time.
Let me do it.

901
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,920
Go on!

902
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:22,590
Pull me over there on the chair.

903
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:25,150
I think it'll be easier than walking.

904
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,030
Thanks.

905
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,440
And now, run!

906
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:16,990
Please, forgive me!

907
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,790
It -

908
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,870
I love you!

909
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,550
Run, please!

910
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,890
Help!

911
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,690
Peter? It's Georg!

912
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,140
Can you hear me?
I can barely hear you!

913
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:31,640
Listen, if you can hear me,

914
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:34,580
send the police over to our
lake house, right away!

915
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:37,580
Hello?

916
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,950
Shit!

917
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:53,670
Peter! Can you hear me?

918
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:02,340
Stop!

919
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:17,190
Missed!

920
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:18,760
Morning, Captain.

921
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,890
Morning.

922
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:24,800
They'll be there any minute.

923
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:27,870
We'll have to hurry then.
Right, Beavis?

924
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:29,780
Why don't you believe me?

925
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:33,040
- How old did we say? 37?
- 35.

926
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:37,180
Good that the battery
charger's in the car!

927
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:39,690
- If it's her age, you must start with her.
- Why?

928
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,590
- The battery was okay.
- That's the rules.

929
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:43,490
Okay, I'll start with her.

930
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,890
Yes, I know.

931
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:49,900
It's time you had another idea.
The lady tried that trick before.

932
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:51,460
Count faster, Beavis.

933
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:55,230
Do you think we have no imagination?

934
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:58,140
Without risk, you can't have a bet,
that's obvious, Captain.

935
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,180
You must have a chance too.

936
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,130
The wind blows where it wishes.

937
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,910
That's the joy of sailing, don't you think?

938
01:29:04,990 --> 01:29:06,320
Right then!

939
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:07,880
...thirty-four, thirty-five!

940
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:10,120
Don't make the same mistake again.

941
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:12,180
It's the one that's left who's turn it is,

942
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,690
not the one who's counted out.

943
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,240
Hang on.

944
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:22,970
I can see a new toy.

945
01:29:23,710 --> 01:29:25,770
I assume we owe this to the lady?

946
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:30,610
This will make things a bit more amusing.

947
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,550
The dumb suffer in unspectacular fashion.

948
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:38,050
We want to offer the audience something...

949
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,180
and show what we can do, right?

950
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,240
You can join in again now.

951
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:57,400
We were already
on first-name terms, right?

952
01:29:58,910 --> 01:30:00,580
So, Anna,

953
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,010
now we're going to play:

954
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:05,520
"The Loving Wife", or...

955
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:07,470
Whether by knife or whether by gun

956
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:09,680
Losing your life can sometimes be fun.

957
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:14,690
Hey! No falling asleep!

958
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:18,560
You have to play with us,
or you'll be gagged again.

959
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:20,470
That's not very nice, is it?

960
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:26,570
So, here are the rules of the game:

961
01:30:26,650 --> 01:30:29,840
Georgie senior has been counted out,
so it's his turn.

962
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:32,850
It'll be hard to change that.

963
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:35,850
Unless you want to take his place.

964
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:38,510
Do you want to?

965
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:44,330
I'm sure Fatty will understand.
Right, Fatty?

966
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,060
Don't call me Fatty.

967
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:50,470
- You see, he understands.
- Get this over with. That's enough.

968
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:52,200
That's enough?

969
01:30:52,270 --> 01:30:53,940
You think that's enough?

970
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:57,470
What do you think, Anna?

971
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:59,910
Have you had enough?
Or do you want to play some more?

972
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,310
Don't reply anymore.

973
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:04,720
Let them do what they want. Please!

974
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:06,950
Then it'll be over quicker.

975
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:09,190
Huh, that's cowardly!

976
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:12,090
We're not up to feature film length yet.

977
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,100
Is that enough?

978
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:15,590
But you want a real ending,

979
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:17,970
with plausible plot development, don't you?

980
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:21,670
The bet is still on.
It can't be withdrawn unilaterally.

981
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:23,430
So:

982
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:25,910
the game is called: "The Loving Wife. "

983
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:29,310
Although Beavis has done the counting,
she can choose...

984
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:31,870
who will be next. And...

985
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:33,610
using what implement!

986
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:36,450
Do we prefer the little knife?

987
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,360
Or the rifle?

988
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:41,760
Well then, what does the housewife say?

989
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:48,260
Hello, wakey, wakey!

990
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:53,910
So, you're not interested?

991
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:56,070
You don't want to play anymore.

992
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,340
Beavis, show her the game again.

993
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:00,610
Wait.

994
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:02,020
Here you are.

995
01:32:02,090 --> 01:32:03,580
Hey, careful!

996
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:05,320
I almost cut myself.

997
01:32:05,390 --> 01:32:06,880
Really?

998
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:21,100
You see. It's the little knife.
You can spare him that.

999
01:32:21,170 --> 01:32:23,010
You only have to play with us.

1000
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:27,770
I understand, Anna.

1001
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:29,340
I understand, really!

1002
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:33,520
It's not a good feeling,
causing the one you love to suffer.

1003
01:32:35,190 --> 01:32:38,250
But it costs so little to avoid all that.

1004
01:32:38,330 --> 01:32:41,820
You only need follow the rules,
and all will be well.

1005
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:09,890
What must I do?

1006
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:15,090
You see, it wasn't that difficult.

1007
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:17,530
And we'll make it easy too.

1008
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:19,770
You recite a prayer of your choice.

1009
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,340
If you say it flawlessly, God will help you

1010
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:24,370
and you choose what happens next.

1011
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:32,550
Or shall we carry on with Georgie senior?

1012
01:33:34,290 --> 01:33:35,320
I don't know a prayer.

1013
01:33:36,990 --> 01:33:38,650
You don't know any prayers?

1014
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,460
Not a single prayer?

1015
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:44,890
Is that possible?

1016
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:47,560
Tell her one, Fatty.

1017
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,660
Stop calling me Fatty all the time.

1018
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:51,730
I'll stop saying it. Well?

1019
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:56,150
Oh Lord and Father, make me kind,
So I, in heaven, my place may find.

1020
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:59,240
- That's too easy.
- I can't think of any others.

1021
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:01,580
Okay.

1022
01:34:01,650 --> 01:34:04,320
Oh Lord and Father, make me kind,
So I, in heaven, my place may find.

1023
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:08,260
No! Not like that!

1024
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:09,820
It's a prayer.

1025
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:12,490
You can't just drone on like that.

1026
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:15,730
You're asking the Lord God for something.
So pray properly.

1027
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:20,080
Go on.
Go down on your knees properly.

1028
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:23,500
Go on! Get on with it!

1029
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:31,620
There. That's right. Kneel down properly.

1030
01:34:34,130 --> 01:34:36,060
Put your hands together.

1031
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:38,560
Not on your stomach.

1032
01:34:38,630 --> 01:34:41,290
Where is the one you pray to?
Up there!

1033
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,970
You have to pray to the heavens!
That's it!

1034
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:50,240
Right, and now, in a fervent tone,
if you don't mind.

1035
01:34:56,450 --> 01:34:59,280
- Beavis, can you help her a little?
- No!

1036
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:10,090
Oh Lord and Father, make me kind,

1037
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,430
So I, in heaven, my place may find.

1038
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,970
Well done!
You did that well!

1039
01:35:17,310 --> 01:35:20,800
That was the trial run,
and now we're going for Olympic Gold:

1040
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:24,210
If you can recite this prayer,
which is sadly much too short,

1041
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:26,940
from back to front, without any mistakes,

1042
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:31,320
you can not only choose
which of you kicks the bucket first,

1043
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:35,660
but also, and no doubt
this will interest you more - how.

1044
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:39,990
whether quick and painless by the bullet...

1045
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:41,530
Careful!

1046
01:35:48,010 --> 01:35:49,980
Where's the remote?

1047
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:53,510
Where's the fucking remote control?

1048
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:22,940
That was the trial run,
and now we're going for Olympic Gold:

1049
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:26,850
If you can recite this prayer,
which is sadly much too short,

1050
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:30,580
from back to front, without any mistakes,

1051
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:33,650
you can not only choose
which of you kicks the bucket first,

1052
01:36:33,730 --> 01:36:38,060
but also, and no doubt
this will interest you more - how:

1053
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:40,970
whether quick and painless by the bul -

1054
01:36:44,710 --> 01:36:48,540
You shouldn't have done that, Anna.
One doesn't break the rules.

1055
01:36:48,610 --> 01:36:51,440
Sorry. You've failed.

1056
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:57,310
Say good-bye to Georgie.

1057
01:37:32,290 --> 01:37:34,280
Would you sit down?

1058
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:16,230
Can you give me your gloves?

1059
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:23,870
...only it's all inverted.

1060
01:38:23,950 --> 01:38:27,410
But of course all these predictions are wrong
so as to avoid a panic.

1061
01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:28,980
But now Kelvin knows how it really is...

1062
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:32,220
and wants to warn his wife
and daughter in time.

1063
01:38:32,290 --> 01:38:34,110
But the problem is not only getting

1064
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:36,290
from the world of antimatter to reality,

1065
01:38:36,370 --> 01:38:37,890
- but also to regain communication -
- Look!

1066
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,930
Now that's a sporting attitude!

1067
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:46,970
Hey, look out, fatso!

1068
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,530
I thought you were a non-swimmer.

1069
01:38:56,890 --> 01:38:59,050
Go and get the widow.
She'll feel lonely otherwise.

1070
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:04,520
Would you mind cooperating?

1071
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:07,570
It's not easy.
Otherwise I might hurt you.

1072
01:39:13,070 --> 01:39:15,010
So. Where was I?

1073
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:18,570
The communication problems
between matter and antimatter.

1074
01:39:18,650 --> 01:39:21,310
Exactly. As if you were in a black hole!

1075
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:25,220
Gravitation is so strong that nothing
can escape it: absolute silence.

1076
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:26,950
- By the way, what's the time?
- What?

1077
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:28,510
What's the time?

1078
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:30,080
Just after eight.

1079
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:31,150
Already?

1080
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:39,300
Why?

1081
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:42,530
The deadline was at 9:00.
She had almost an hour left!

1082
01:39:42,610 --> 01:39:45,070
Firstly,
it was too hard to sail like that,

1083
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:49,640
- and secondly, I'm starting to get hungry.
- That's true.

1084
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,990
...when Kelvin overcomes gravitation,

1085
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:07,400
it turns out that one universe is real,

1086
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:09,630
but the other is just a fiction.

1087
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:11,070
How does that happen?

1088
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:14,470
What do I know! It was a kind of
model projection in cyberspace.

1089
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:17,880
And where is your hero now?
In reality or fiction?

1090
01:40:17,950 --> 01:40:20,440
His family is in reality
and he's in fiction.

1091
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:23,680
- But the fiction is real, isn't it?
- How do you mean?

1092
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:26,750
- Well, you see it in the film, right?
- Of course.

1093
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:30,120
So, it's just as real as the reality
which you see likewise, right?

1094
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:31,320
- Crap.
- Why?

1095
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:02,230
Is anyone awake yet?

1096
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:10,830
Who is it?

1097
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:19,340
Good morning to you.

1098
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:21,910
Sorry to disturb you so early,
but I've come from Anna's.

1099
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:23,480
And?

1100
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:26,480
Don't you remember me?

1101
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:29,220
Yesterday afternoon, on the jetty.
I'm Paul.

1102
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:30,780
Oh, yes.

1103
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,830
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1104
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:37,230
Anna sent me. We had guests arrive
unexpectedly this morning...

1105
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:40,300
and she wonders if
you could spare her a few eggs?

1106
01:41:40,370 --> 01:41:41,860
I think so.

1107
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:43,430
Come in.

1108
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:45,670
Wait a minute.
