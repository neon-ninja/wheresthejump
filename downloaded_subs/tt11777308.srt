1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,302
Were they in Korean or English?

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,903
Or what? I couldn't tell.

3
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,772
I couldn't tell.

4
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,608
I thought that they
were arguing in Korean.

5
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,980
Can you turn off
the lights in the bathroom?

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,215
- Yeah.

7
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:18,418
Oh God, of all
the times for this to go down.

8
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,629
Do you want to open the windows?

9
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,155
- No.

10
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:25,558
They're taking
someone through the alley.

11
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,134
It's too dark, I can't see.

12
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,836
It looks like a woman.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,080
Okay look at this.

14
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,607
This must have something to do
with what happened last night.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,009
This is down the block
from my apartment.

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,390
More blood.

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,626
More blood.

18
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,772
So this is further up the block.

19
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:03,897
Look at this.

20
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,842
Something big went down
last night.

21
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,968
Something crazy happened here.

22
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,705
What the fuck
happened last night?

23
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,343
- What do you think?

24
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,669
-Creepy.

25
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,539
It's a coroner.

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,041
There you have it.

27
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,610
Murder in Koreatown on my block.

28
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,822
Got a little gruesome pic here

29
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,648
from the crime scene.

30
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,318
Okay so she was 26.

31
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,930
This guy was 31.

32
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,155
I'm gonna see if I can find

33
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,723
any of these neighbors,

34
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,593
see if anybody knew these people.
I just figure...

35
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,196
Maybe this is an interesting
thing I can make a video about.

36
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,032
And what I don't
understand also...

37
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,169
Okay. Lets just see.
Hold on one sec.

38
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:19,706
Okay. So let's do a little
recap of what happened.

39
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,407
Oops.

40
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,510
So there was a scream

41
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,311
out there in the alley.

42
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,013
And then...

43
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,582
The police took her through

44
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,218
the alley back here.

45
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,387
See right back there
there's the alley.

46
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,022
They took her through
there and then

47
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,691
all the way through
my apartment complex.

48
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,360
Now what's weird is that

49
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,362
her apartment complex is

50
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,839
way down there.

51
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,732
Uh, way down the block.

52
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,434
So I guess the thing
that's so weird to me

53
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,379
is uh what she was doing

54
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,006
so far down in this
part of the alley.

55
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,541
And then also...

56
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,176
Uh... I'm wondering about

57
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,319
the blood that was

58
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,013
down there on the corner

59
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,715
even further away
from the crime scene.

60
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,652
Okay, so I made this little
map here just to

61
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,064
sort of illustrate
just how far away

62
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,491
she was arrested from
her apartment,

63
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,792
the scene of the crime.

64
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,094
And also look at how far away

65
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,430
this blood that I
found on the front street

66
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,999
is away from the
scene of the crime as well.

67
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,969
So we'll be getting to the
bottom of this real soon.

68
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:29,909
- Here we are at the
scene of the crime.

69
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,445
I'm just gonna hang
out here for a little bit.

70
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,648
And see if anybody uh comes out.

71
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,926
And I'll ask them

72
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,751
If they know anything
about what happened.

73
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,820
So I'll be here.

74
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,696
Well it seems like
everybody's at work

75
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,664
or doing something right now.

76
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,833
So I'll take a little walk
around the neighborhood,

77
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:56,869
give you guys a tour,
a flavor of the city.

78
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,550
- Fuck you nigga.
- Fuck you.

79
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,619
Fuck you
motherfucking niggers man.

80
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,920
Don't steal again.

81
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,122
- Don't come again!

82
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,191
- Call the
motherfucking police bitch.

83
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,461
- Why you stealing?

84
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,264
- Call the motherfucking police.

85
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,832
Shut the fuck and
call the police.

86
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,235
You know it's not
really going my way today

87
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,081
I think it's a little hot
and everyone's inside or at work.

88
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,708
But I'm gonna come back out
a little bit later or tomorrow

89
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:36,776
and check back in.

90
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,078
You have a question for me?

91
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,947
- A question for you?

92
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,315
What kind of question

93
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,549
should I be asking you?

94
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,486
- It's your movie, I don't know.

95
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,122
You're the one
that asks the questions.

96
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,257
- Are you gonna try to murder me

97
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,726
like that lady murdered her husband?

98
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,497
Promise? - Only if you're bad.

99
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,999
- Only if I'm bad?

100
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,201
- Yeah.
- Okay.

101
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,009
Okay this guy sleeps right here

102
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,444
on the uh...

103
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,289
like in front of
my apartment building.

104
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,149
So he probably saw
what went down.

105
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,851
I'll ask him a little bit later
when he wakes up.

106
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,787
Did you see anything like...

107
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,864
there was a guy out here

108
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,022
he was bloody and stuff

109
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,900
- No.
- You didn't see anything?

110
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,492
Okay, so you don't
know what happened?

111
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,593
- No.

112
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,471
- Okay. Alright. Well thank you.

113
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,563
- Alright.
- Okay.

114
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,199
Okay here we are back again

115
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,802
another day at the
scene of the crime.

116
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,838
You know...

117
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,183
Let's see here...

118
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,527
Maybe I can get in

119
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,087
and check on this place.

120
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,130
Let's see here.

121
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,557
Let's see here
Okay. Well it's locked.

122
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,925
I probably shouldn't

123
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,293
be doing this anyway.

124
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,128
Well I'll just hang out here.

125
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,162
And uh see

126
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,907
If I can find any
of these neighbors

127
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,265
without trespassing.

128
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,043
So you didn't know her?

129
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,937
- No, no actually I just moved
in not too long ago so...

130
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,014
- Oh really?

131
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,107
Yeah so I don't really
know anybody there.

132
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,384
- Okay.
- To be honest, but uh...

133
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,552
- Where'd you move from?

134
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,920
- But yeah, from
Florida actually.

135
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:18,978
- Oh really?
- Yeah yeah.

136
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,148
- Alright, murder in your new
apartment complex, welcome to LA right?

137
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,249
Yeah right.

138
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,293
- Um.

139
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,486
Okay well do you think that

140
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,488
any of your neighbors
might know anybody

141
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,566
or like know any
information about it?

142
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,358
Like I said, I mean
I just moved in and

143
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,535
I don't really know anybody

144
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,237
- Okay you don't know anybody

145
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,463
- Yeah. To be honest,
the neighbors aren't that friendly

146
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,731
they kinda keep to themselves.

147
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,176
Oh actually there,
I think there is one lady that...

148
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,269
she lives downstairs who
might know something.

149
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,505
She talks a lot,
she's an old lady so...

150
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,473
Okay. Um.

151
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,242
Do you think there's any chance

152
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,387
cause there's a gate over there

153
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,479
um you can see it's locked.

154
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,914
Do you think maybe
I could come...

155
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,416
you could bring me
in there with you?

156
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,951
And uh, I could try to
talk to her a little bit?

157
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,653
Uh, I mean...

158
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,155
I dunno.
That might be a little much.

159
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,623
- It's too much.
- Yeah cause it's

160
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,868
it's kind of a sensitive topic.

161
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,427
- Okay. Uh. Well how about this?

162
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,563
Do you think I could get your number
and maybe you could ask that lady?

163
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,232
- Yeah. Yeah sure.

164
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,010
- I'll give you a ring later?

165
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,469
- Yeah hope it helps.

166
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,070
- Alright. Thanks buh bye.

167
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,572
Okay.

168
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,316
Okay.

169
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,551
- God bless you.

170
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,719
Thank you. God bless you.
Thank you.

171
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:34,921
I heard a scream.

172
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,123
Like I said
I can't talk about it right now

173
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,400
- Okay. Um....

174
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,864
Do you think
we could talk later? Or?

175
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,037
- Maybe, I don't know.
Now is not a good time.

176
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,430
- Okay.
- Alright. Okay thank you.

177
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,965
I think I'm going to call it a night.

178
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,867
People really aren't that friendly

179
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,270
they don't want to talk
to me but that's okay, so...

180
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,939
Uh... - You're crazy

181
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,608
- Well I'm not that crazy...
- Yeah.

182
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,144
- Okay but, okay so what do you...
you don't...

183
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,879
You just don't think
it's a big deal?

184
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,824
Or what's your?
- No. I mean I think it's like

185
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,827
I mean obviously it's a really
crazy thing to happen just...

186
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,420
right down the street from us
which is a little...

187
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,156
you know... unsettling.
...A little?

188
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,600
Why was she
so far back in our alley

189
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,125
I guess that's my question.

190
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,393
I mean...

191
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,830
It could be anything.

192
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,265
Like it could just be some...

193
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,767
small piece of evidence that
that she needed to show them

194
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,436
relating to the crime,
I mean who knows?

195
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,271
- She freaked out and ran I guess?

196
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,173
- Yeah like she
could've ran there or

197
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,051
- Well...
- I mean..

198
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,910
- I don't know.
- Well what about the blood...

199
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,478
In the front you know over on uh

200
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,946
Pico and Menlo.

201
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,214
That's like really far away

202
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,616
from their apartment complex.

203
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,385
- It's possible that he got got
stabbed more than once. Right?

204
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,453
And...

205
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,256
It's possible that if you're stabbed
without being life threatening

206
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,501
you're just kinda
bleeding all over the place, right?

207
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,060
- So she stabbed him
over at Pico and Menlo?

208
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,229
And then ran back,
he ran back to the apartment.

209
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,932
- She chased him with a knife.
It could be. Yeah.

210
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,133
Right? I mean.

211
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,401
- Well I don't buy it.

212
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,213
-I don't know. I don't think it's.

213
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,772
I think the case is closed.

214
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,285
I think you're overreacting.
I mean what do you think happened?

215
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,119
- I don't know what happened.
That's why I'm making...

216
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,312
that's why I'm doing this.
Cause I need to know.

217
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,414
- I dunno I think you're gonna
drive yourself crazy

218
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,850
trying to figure this out.
I think you just gotta give it up.

219
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,185
- Well I just,
I'm just getting started. So...

220
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,520
So one thing, I...

221
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,989
Uh...

222
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,992
You might be wondering why
you're not seeing my face.

223
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,061
Uh, but...

224
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,329
I'm a little bit camera shy...

225
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,264
I don't really know
if I want anybody to know

226
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,666
uh...

227
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,235
who's making this project. So...

228
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,672
Here is... the alley.

229
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,942
This is where they
arrested the murderer.

230
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,611
Okay, this is
the back of the apartment

231
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,513
where the body was found.

232
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,081
This is also where

233
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,583
the uh murderer

234
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,418
at some point came though this

235
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,728
uh little back part

236
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,363
down to the alley right here.

237
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,556
Some I'm just gonna hang
out in the alley a little bit

238
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,692
and see if I can't catch
some of these neighbors.

239
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,193
Hey excuse me.

240
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,428
Yes sir? - Uh...

241
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,596
I'm making a little video

242
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,131
about a murder that took place.
Uh....

243
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,943
So you don't really
know that much else

244
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,168
about what happened? Or...

245
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,279
- No I don't.
- Okay.

246
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,938
Alright, well uh...

247
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,774
Do you think your wife
knows anything else, or?

248
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,776
- No.
- Okay.

249
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,445
Alright. Well uh,

250
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,146
Thank you very much
for talking to me.

251
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,181
- Thank you.

252
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,692
- Alright have a good day.
- Thank you.

253
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,783
- Okay.

254
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,552
You don't know anything?

255
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,587
Okay, uh...
Do you speak English?

256
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,190
Uh not very much? Poquito?

257
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,135
Okay so you don't know anything
about the murder that...

258
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,194
- No man.

259
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,595
- No nothing?

260
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,997
Okay. Alright.

261
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,798
Okay thank you.... Okay.

262
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,201
- No that's okay.
...No no no, please please.

263
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,569
Please.... No no.

264
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:37,670
- Okay thank you.

265
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,112
Okay, finally... Excuse me.

266
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,723
Um... I'm doing a little uh

267
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:48,981
Documentary kind of thing

268
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,059
about a...
a murder that happened

269
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,652
over in uh this
apartment complex

270
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,463
Do you live in
that apartment complex?

271
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,497
- Yeah I do.

272
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,865
- Um...

273
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,990
Do you know

274
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,135
the lady who murdered her husband?
Did you know them?

275
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,162
- It's really sad I mean
she was a sweet lady

276
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,598
I don't know
anything what happened.

277
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,767
Okay you don't know what happened?
- No.

278
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,435
- But she was really nice.

279
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,537
- Okay. Were you there
the night of the murder?

280
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,906
- Yeah I was there. I mean...

281
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,007
I was home.

282
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,308
- Okay. Um...

283
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,611
But do you know why she did it?

284
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:19,812
- I have no idea.

285
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,181
- You...
- I mean it creeps me out.

286
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,550
- Okay. Yeah. It is pretty weird.

287
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,627
- It's really sad.

288
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,020
I don't want to really
talk about it right now.

289
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,256
Okay. Do you think
it would be possible if

290
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,867
maybe we talked a
little bit later about-

291
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,702
- I doubt it, no.

292
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,261
- No I don't want to talk about it.

293
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,305
- Okay, you don't want to talk about it?
- No.

294
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,007
- Okay. Alright. Well uh...

295
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,300
Thank you very much I appreciate it.
- Thank you. Ciao.

296
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,968
- Okay. Have a nice day. Okay.

297
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,439
Well that weird, uh I had it pulled up.

298
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,673
Okay. Well...

299
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,276
Here, have some... window.

300
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,244
I was looking into
getting the police report.

301
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,147
And it's a no go.
It's not happening.

302
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,315
There's a trial coming up

303
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,683
And basically the only way for me

304
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,820
to get a copy of that is if I had been

305
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,588
a relative of the deceased

306
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,193
or if I was a lawyer
somehow involved in the case. So...

307
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,734
Uh I haven't really
tried to track down

308
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,771
any of these people around uh
this little apartment here.

309
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:22,141
Near the corner
where I found the blood.

310
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,350
I've just been walking
up and down the block here.

311
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,196
You can kinda see maybe where
they cleaned it up a little bit.

312
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,689
But the rest of the blood is gone.

313
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,258
It's been cleaned up at this point.

314
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,227
So...

315
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,095
I hope you
can hear me over this...

316
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,630
Helicopter.

317
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,601
Eh...

318
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,770
Anyway so at this point...

319
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,204
I haven't found anybody

320
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,974
who knows what the fuck
happened here uh...

321
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:58,177
I might as well be like the only
person other than the police

322
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,846
who knows anything about
the blood that was over here.

323
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,415
Wow.

324
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,152
- It's a different world
when you wake up early boo.

325
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,287
- Well no, it's not about that.
- I'm kidding.

326
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,624
If you can't tell...

327
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,826
Part...
the reason I'm making this is...

328
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,861
Part of the reason I have
so much time on my hands

329
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,563
is because... uh...

330
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,466
you know I lost my job...

331
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,944
several months back... uh...

332
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,937
You know it's just...

333
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,908
It's tough getting back
into the swing of things and...

334
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,378
and dealing with... the uh...

335
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,190
constant rejection...

336
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,249
The world gets you down you know?

337
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,452
It's beating down on you every day.
And you know...

338
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,622
You know that's why uh...
doing this project

339
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,393
has been sort of like
a breath of fresh air for me because...

340
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,361
you know... its...

341
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,798
given me a little bit of a reason...

342
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,333
to wake up in the morning.

343
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,677
So you used to work with Tae right?

344
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,145
- Yeah. Well,
I knew him as Andy.

345
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,123
- Okay so how do you feel
about his death?

346
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,515
And the... - Its...

347
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,561
It's terrible. Um its...

348
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,795
super tragic...

349
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,288
I... it's the last person
that I would expect

350
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,158
something like that to...
you know, to happen to them.

351
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,493
- Okay. And so did you know
his wife as well?

352
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,728
Or? - Yeah.

353
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,663
Yeah I did. I had um...

354
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,133
I met her a few, a few times.
She was kind of quiet...

355
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,468
but seemed very sweet.

356
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,338
And it seemed like they had
a really good relationship overall.

357
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,040
And so like what happened?
Or why do you think she did it?

358
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,876
I don't know man.
Shit got really weird

359
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,487
right after they moved into
that new place a couple months ago.

360
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,380
- Okay, and how so?

361
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,415
- He... I dunno he just...

362
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,651
would have like weird
sort of expressions on his face.

363
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:49,054
He seemed like really tired like
he wasn't getting a lot of sleep.

364
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,789
It seemed like,
he didn't say it exactly...

365
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,667
but it seemed like
they were fighting a lot...

366
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,760
which had never happened before.

367
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,496
I know moving can be stressful.

368
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,798
But it was way more than...
than that...

369
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,767
Something was wrong.... Okay.

370
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,471
Uh, that's two people now
that have confirmed...

371
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:09,775
that the murderer
was a very nice lady.

372
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:16,448
Something doesn't ring about
the idea of a nice woman...

373
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,862
just, I dunno, snapping,
and killing her husband.

374
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,322
I mean, I guess murders happen but...

375
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,291
something about it
just doesn't add up.

376
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,993
- He was uh...

377
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,230
and someone put a chair for me
because I'm homeless.

378
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,066
And he came by and
graffiti'd it over and over.

379
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,944
And no, I don't know his name.

380
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,870
And I asked him
"what are you writing?"

381
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,471
He wouldn't say.
Then he pretends

382
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,775
he doesn't speak English.
That he only speaks uh...

383
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,977
- I'm the property manger, why?

384
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,646
- Uh well... Actually, uh...

385
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,015
Do you know anything about
the murder that happened here?

386
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,451
- As far as I'm concerned it's over.

387
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,653
- But you don't know about why
there was blood on the

388
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,465
front of the street or why she
was arrested so far back in my alley?

389
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,800
- I have no idea about that.

390
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,959
Look...

391
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,404
You can't keep filming here.
I'm gonna have to call the cops

392
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,229
cause the tenants
keep complaining about you.

393
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,598
- I'm not trying to
be disrespectful I just have

394
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,176
a lot of unanswered questions
about this murder.

395
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,269
- You're not gonna find anything.
- Yeah but...

396
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,847
Okay well...
- Look, you can't film here.

397
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,307
- Well...
- Put down the camera and go home.

398
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,876
I guess it's just...
It took a second

399
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,412
for it to really like
sink in what this means...

400
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,847
But uh... You know...

401
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,485
If I'm banned more or less
from the property...

402
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,221
where the victim was found...

403
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,291
Then this investigation
is like over.

404
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,226
I... you know... it's just...

405
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,195
Maybe I should
give this fucking thing up

406
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,974
and go look for a job.

407
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,875
Maybe it's just not right for me.

408
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,968
Who would've thought
that it would be this hard

409
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:47,373
to just find one person
who knows something more...

410
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,875
about what happened than
we already know.

411
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:54,413
You know, the world's not a fair place.
In case you didn't know, okay. So...

412
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,482
You know, just cause...

413
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,951
you know I deserve a
little something from this...

414
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,919
from all the the time
I've been putting into it.

415
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,288
You know, maybe I'm just
the world's worst investigator...

416
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,700
uh, failure at life...

417
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,960
I should just go
jump off a fucking bridge.

418
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,829
How am I supposed to go on
with my life if I don't know about

419
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,898
what she was doing in the alley.
And...

420
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,667
why there was blood on the front
of the street. Okay?

421
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,603
So now I don't really
know what to do

422
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,471
and I just wanted to tell you...

423
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:23,142
my confidant uh...
in this project...

424
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:27,513
So I just...
- I'm sorry. I mean...

425
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,919
Maybe it's just time to give it up.

426
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,490
Well, what about the
blood on the street,

427
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,160
you know I still have a lot
of unanswered questions.

428
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,905
I feel like it's not...
going anywhere.

429
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,932
And I feel like those things
are just...

430
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:50,736
random coincidences...
- Yeah we've it been over before.

431
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,173
I mean, I know you've been hating
on this project since the beginning.

432
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,409
It's okay, you can admit it.
I don't care.

433
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,845
- I just feel like it's not,
there's not point.

434
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,247
And I just think that
you're wasting your time.

435
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,758
-Ugh. Okay.

436
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,851
Well, maybe I'll just
sleep on it.

437
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,086
And maybe tomorrow

438
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,489
I'll just give it up and start
looking for a job.

439
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,561
- Is it good luck,
or is it bad luck?

440
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,697
-I hope it's good luck.

441
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,204
I just had the weirdest dream.

442
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,342
It was his face.

443
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,579
Right in front of me.
It was like staring at this picture.

444
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,047
And...

445
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,559
There was all this writing
that was in Korean.

446
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:41,053
And...
I have no idea what it said...

447
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,488
But it was like...

448
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:46,091
One of the most
weird dreams I've ever had.

449
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,069
And...

450
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,329
I just don't know
what to make of it.

451
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:17,866
- The bible says
hell is the whole salvation.

452
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,692
Hell is the accepted path.

453
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:26,732
Jesus Christ. Son of God.

454
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,967
- What you do with Jesus.

455
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,504
The call of God is to repent,
turn around.

456
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,007
Repent, turn around.

457
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,376
Believe in the lord Jesus Christ

458
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,521
follow righteousness and holiness

459
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,781
and you can escape the damnation of hell.

460
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,518
If this hasn't already been
a weird enough morning...

461
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,596
Look at this...
I just passed this.

462
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,355
And I need to get a shot of it.

463
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,358
Okay... Look at this.

464
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:59,340
Now this is going to
sound totally crazy but...

465
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:03,302
I feel like this message
is written for me because it's...

466
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,672
basically identical to
what I saw in my dream last night

467
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,108
and I would love to know
what the fuck this says....

468
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,779
because I am freaking out
right now.

469
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,224
There's no way it's just
a coincidence that I

470
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,884
stumble upon this writing that...

471
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,719
came to me in a dream.

472
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:24,189
And now it mentions
the pastor story.

473
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,767
And I happen to see...

474
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,227
A street preacher pastor kind of guy...

475
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,628
And... Okay...

476
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,830
This is already weird enough right?

477
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,265
It gets way crazier.

478
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,400
Okay. I've seen...

479
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,535
this guy...

480
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,314
maybe it was one of his friends,
I've seen him before.

481
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,606
Now look at this.

482
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:44,276
I took this video
the morning of the murder.

483
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,078
Maybe it's not the same guy.

484
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,412
But they're obviously...

485
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,981
you know... coordinated.

486
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:52,117
So what the fuck is happening here?

487
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,922
- So here's my question.
Can you get one of your friends from work

488
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,890
to help translate this for me?

489
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,427
Please?

490
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:06,431
- You have to
give this up, it's, this is insane.

491
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,866
- Just get her to come...

492
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,135
- I thought you
were done with this already.

493
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,412
- Well, I
said I would sleep on it

494
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,676
and I slept on it and a bunch
of other shit has happened.

495
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,550
So, now I'm not done with it
until I get this translated

496
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,651
and then maybe I'll be done with it,

497
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,178
or I will be done with it.
I promise, okay, just ask.

498
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,215
All you have to do is ask her.
It's gonna be great.

499
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,394
Okay so while I've got this downtime

500
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:30,431
waiting for our translator this weekend,

501
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,268
if I was gonna prioritize
what I need to be doing,

502
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,161
looking for somebody who
knows about the blood

503
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,563
that was on the front street
is the most important part

504
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,607
of my investigation.

505
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,676
So, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna stake it out

506
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,369
and I'm gonna find
somebody and that's that.

507
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,715
- Some... some... blood on his
hand, for sure, I saw that.

508
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,816
- Okay.

509
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,176
- He was like leaning
over kinda holding his side and...

510
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,621
I saw that. And I was like,
"Does this guy need any help?"

511
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,746
"Should I be concerned?"

512
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,924
I kind of approached him
and he just ran off.

513
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,960
He didn't want any help.
It was weird, man.

514
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,596
- Well... Which way did he run?

515
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,197
- He ran back that way.

516
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,266
- Okay, well.

517
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,201
- You all right though?

518
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,828
You doing all right, man?
- No no no I'm

519
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,273
- Look, okay,
here's what I don't understand...

520
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:18,070
Cause he was murdered down there
and he came, he ran this way?

521
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,304
- He did, but uh...

522
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,749
- Well, what did he look like?
Tell me what the guy looked like.

523
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:25,887
- Well he was an older, he was an older,
older, older like Asian guy,

524
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,389
probably like 5'6" or
whatever, but I'm not sure why....

525
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,957
No no he was...
- Why you're asking all that.

526
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:34,586
- No, he was younger.
He was a young tall guy and he,

527
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,388
are you sure you got a good look at him?

528
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:40,092
- 100% man, but you kind of, you know,
you're kind of scaring me a little bit.

529
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,337
You're looking kind of,
kind of nervous, man.

530
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,738
- No, no, no. Just...

531
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,807
- Hey, bro, see, I'm
trying to help you out

532
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,843
but you're kind of,
you're coming on a little strong.

533
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,445
You want me to call somebody?
- Dude I'm doing fine.

534
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,713
- You want me to call
somebody for you right now?

535
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:52,838
Okay you know what?

536
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,951
You don't know what you're talking about
You're full of shit, okay, all right.

537
00:22:56,341 --> 00:23:00,979
So, as you can see I've been
busy trying to work through

538
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:04,892
all the details and I'm just wondering,

539
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:09,063
is it possible that I was
wrong about this third person?

540
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,565
Could there have been a
third person involved?

541
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:14,893
I guess that would really answer
a lot of the questions I have here.

542
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,171
I was just searching the
Internet for this case

543
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:21,242
and Mi-Sun Yoo, who is accused
of murdering her husband,

544
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:25,113
she claimed, she said to
the police that there was

545
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:28,082
a third person there that
broke into their apartment

546
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,146
and committed this murder.

547
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,819
So, I think now it's almost certain

548
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,855
that there was a third
person involved in this.

549
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:38,693
This guy, the apartment
manager, was so defensive.

550
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:43,231
He definitely fits the description,
short Asian guy, older.

551
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,501
So, you know, maybe this is like
the big break in the case

552
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,993
that I've been looking for.

553
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,838
Okay, I'm just, I'm keeping my distance.

554
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,241
So, I'm not technically near the property

555
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,943
but I'm gonna stake this
place out for a little bit

556
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,571
and see if I can find
this apartment manager.

557
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,682
Okay well, I'm just going
back to my apartment now.

558
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,251
It's a waste of time at this point.

559
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,520
I'm gonna come back a little bit later

560
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,021
in the afternoon and try to catch him

561
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,123
when he's coming home from work.

562
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,527
Okay so, I just heard back from
this guy with some bad news.

563
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,796
The old lady at his apartment complex,

564
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,533
I won't be meeting with her
because I've already met her.

565
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:23,171
Voila, this is the "old
lady" who's probably like 40.

566
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:26,307
And then the other bad news is that

567
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:30,478
this apartment manager guy,
he's been confirmed now

568
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,614
that he was out of town on
the night of the murder,

569
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:37,118
so that's double dose of dead ends

570
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,910
and that's how my day is going.

571
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:44,883
Look at this weird light, so anyway.

572
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,421
Hello?

573
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,560
Weird vibe today.

574
00:24:56,428 --> 00:25:00,208
So, I don't even know really
what I'm gonna do now.

575
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,901
And I don't want to put all
of my eggs in one basket

576
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,713
but I really have a feeling.

577
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:10,117
And it's hard for me to explain really,
but I have a feeling like this graffiti

578
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,386
is possibly the missing
link and maybe there's

579
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,747
a piece of evidence in there that's really
gonna point me in the right direction.

580
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,459
So, we got the translator coming tomorrow

581
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,619
and I can't wait to see what she says.

582
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:25,266
I totally spaced that I had
seen this graffiti before.

583
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,336
On the couch, there's
the lady with the couch,

584
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,528
the homeless lady.

585
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,006
Look at this, like this
weird Jesus fish thing.

586
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,343
So, I think this is the same guy

587
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,470
and we'll try to get
this translated as well.

588
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,848
So, she didn't tell you about the murder

589
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,474
or anything like that? Or...?

590
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,743
- No.

591
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,555
- Okay so,
actually it happened to be

592
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,323
at this apartment complex right here.

593
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:52,260
And there's all these like, sort of like
weird inconsistencies

594
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,395
about like what happened with it.

595
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,266
So, I found this graffiti up here that I,

596
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,369
and there have been these
street preacher kinda guys,

597
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,370
and I uh, I don't know.

598
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,264
I just feel like it all is, you know,
like working together in some way.

599
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,576
You know?

600
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,101
- Okay.

601
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:14,539
Oh, no,
it used to be right there.

602
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,885
This is, oh shit.

603
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,520
Anyway, I think there's another one

604
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,188
that's like just down the block.

605
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,682
You're okay if we go check that one out?

606
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,159
- Um. Yeah.

607
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:29,063
- Okay cool, all right, oh, man.

608
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,398
I'm sorry about that.

609
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,724
We walked all the way
over here and it's gone.

610
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,870
Well, it used to be
right there and there was

611
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:39,140
a homeless lady that
used to live here, too.

612
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:46,171
And I don't know, hey,
you didn't see any,

613
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,949
there used to be a couch right here

614
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,808
with some like graffiti on it.
- What is it?

615
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,176
- A couch.
- A couch?

616
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,211
And a homeless lady
that used to live here.

617
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,513
- Yeah there used to be a
couch over here, what happened?

618
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,015
- I don't know what happened to it.

619
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,384
- You looking for the couch
or you're looking for the lady?

620
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,761
- Both actually.

621
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,463
Well, we've got her here.

622
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:06,191
She was gonna translate what
was written on the couch.

623
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,437
Okay, it's been gone?

624
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,830
- The lady comes at night time.

625
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,632
You find her at night time.
- Okay alright.

626
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,433
- In the day time,
I don't know where she at.

627
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,868
- Okay, all, right, well thank you.

628
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:21,573
Anyway, so yeah, this whole month or so

629
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,385
has been pretty crazy
because I've been looking

630
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,946
into what's been going
on with this murder and uh...

631
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,983
Okay, hold on, oh shit.

632
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,652
Okay, wait, there we go, all right.

633
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:34,719
Um...

634
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,023
Let's see.

635
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:43,428
- Well, he's talking
about a Korean pastor.

636
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:49,034
He's saying let's try to avoid him.

637
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,441
- Avoid who though, the pastor?

638
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:59,420
- Yeah, I guess he's
just telling everybody

639
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:03,448
to avoid the pastor as much as possible.

640
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:08,529
I mean, he seems kind of not all there,

641
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:11,032
like he's not making any sense.

642
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,468
- Okay, there was
another one right down here.

643
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:17,004
It's gone of course.

644
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,496
Let me just...

645
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:25,336
Okay well...

646
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,072
Okay sorry.

647
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,750
I just thought that it
might still be still under there,

648
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:30,885
but it's not.

649
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,953
I have video of that other one.

650
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:37,282
Do you think maybe we
could just go, oh sorry.

651
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,584
Do you think that maybe
we could just go

652
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,862
back to the apartment
and you can translate

653
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,288
maybe from the video?

654
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,923
Or, would that be okay?

655
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,624
There was another one. - Yeah.

656
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,326
- Okay, it's fine?

657
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,037
Okay, yeah, let's go back, we'll go back

658
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:54,008
and we'll just, yeah, we'll
translate from the video.

659
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,310
And I just, I wonder if it was here.

660
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,603
Hold on one second.

661
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,308
It's so thick, it could
be on any of these.

662
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,312
Okay, well, pardon the mess.

663
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,414
Okay, we'll go back to the
apartment and we'll just,

664
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,358
we'll go back to the apartment.

665
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,485
Okay, all right, let's just
go back to the apartment.

666
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:17,689
She's not that happy that I'm
still working on this but...

667
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,025
Sorry it's taking so long.

668
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,029
Okay, this is the one, this is the couch

669
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:28,533
the homeless lady had right next to her.

670
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,770
So, what's, what in the hell does it say?

671
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,483
- Bungeoppang,

672
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:41,813
bungeoppang is a old Korean dessert.

673
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,818
So, she wrote,
she drew a little fish.

674
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:51,790
It's a dessert that looks
like the shape of a fish.

675
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,834
- Well, okay,
hold on, there's another.

676
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,995
There's another, it's the pastor's story.

677
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,473
- Okay, this is insane.

678
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:03,377
The guy is talking about
the same pastor again,

679
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:08,873
but this time it seems like
he's mentioning other names

680
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,776
and they're saying that they're bad men.

681
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:15,089
He's saying that the pastors are bad men.

682
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:18,459
And he kind of just rambles on like
none of it makes sense.

683
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,853
I think he's, I want to
say he's not all there.

684
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,000
He might be mentally ill.

685
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,002
I'm pretty sure he's homeless.

686
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:31,238
- It's gotta
have something to do with what...

687
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,264
with what I'm working on.

688
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,533
You think?

689
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,769
- How?

690
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,773
- It's, it's, it's
not just a coincidence.

691
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:44,785
This all has, it's all
coming to a head somehow.

692
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,277
I just have to figure out how.

693
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,850
- I think you're reaching

694
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:55,029
and I don't think has...

695
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,288
- Okay, well,
you don't believe me then...

696
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,333
that's two.

697
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,535
One, two, I guess we're done.

698
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,095
You can go now,

699
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,465
I'll go in the bedroom.

700
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,411
My fucking girlfriend is gonna kill me,

701
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:15,173
but I feel like, like I have
to come back out tonight.

702
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:20,278
I'm telling you, I have
a feeling that tonight

703
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:24,582
I'm supposed to go out
here and find...

704
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:30,397
the lady with the couch or
find the guy who wrote the graffiti

705
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:34,802
or find something at
one of these key spots.

706
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:37,362
And I know it's gonna happen.
So...

707
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:41,299
Back here at the scene of the crime.

708
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,604
Back here where the blood was.

709
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:53,220
No couch, no lady.

710
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,780
I seen her fucking every day probably

711
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:59,350
for the past five years
and then out of nowhere

712
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,495
just the day that I need to find her

713
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,655
she's disappeared off the
fucking face of the Earth.

714
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:08,035
If I could just find the guy
who wrote this fucking graffiti

715
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,328
then I could sleep well tonight.

716
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,772
But it looks like

717
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,698
it's just not happening.

718
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,870
Back here in the alley
where she was arrested.

719
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:22,173
It's the last stop of the night.

720
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:33,861
Okay, look, I don't like
to be sneaking around

721
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,263
doing things behind my girlfriend's back

722
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,199
but basically I just
lied to her and told her

723
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,659
that I was giving up my investigation

724
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,263
and... I'm not.

725
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:49,067
Because there's something
else that's at play here.

726
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,136
I'm gonna make a big video tomorrow.

727
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,907
Sort of uh, explain something.

728
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,845
I just... I had the dream again.

729
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,050
I've taken some time
to collect my thoughts

730
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:09,263
and I wanted to make a video
to come clean about something

731
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,366
which might shed light
on my behavior lately.

732
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,235
I want to explain an aspect
of this investigation

733
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,561
that I haven't shared yet.

734
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,397
You didn't do it to play a trick on me?

735
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,308
- Why would I do that?

736
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,443
- You promise?

737
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,936
- Of course, I
wouldn't even think of that.

738
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,183
Pay for it, Bobby ain't bothering me.

739
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,884
You got it all coming on you.

740
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,944
You got it all coming on you.

741
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:45,390
- It's as if something
has been trying to communicate with me

742
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,292
and it's been giving me
a very distinct feeling

743
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:51,396
that I've only had once before in my life

744
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,700
when I was a child and my
mother died unexpectedly.

745
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,869
I woke up in the middle of the night

746
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:00,981
and I knew the moment that she passed.

747
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,841
I can't explain how but I felt it.

748
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:08,789
And it's the same feeling
that I've been having lately.

749
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,091
And it's part of the reason
I've been so persistent

750
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,051
in my investigation.

751
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,287
I haven't felt the same
since I first dreamt you,

752
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,532
Tae Kyung Sung.

753
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,359
I don't even know how
to say your name right

754
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,128
but I feel such a deep connection to you.

755
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:28,575
So, if it's you that's trying
to communicate with me,

756
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,080
I choose to communicate
back that I'm here to help.

757
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,239
But as I'm reaching a dead end,

758
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,508
I ask for your help in return,

759
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,311
for your blessing to continue

760
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:43,357
and for something that points
me in the right direction

761
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:46,350
so I can bring closure for us both.

762
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,043
Hey. - Hi, how are you?

763
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,079
- Good, do
you mind if I film this?

764
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,170
- No, go ahead.

765
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,639
- I've been
doing an investigation into a murder.

766
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:12,786
And it's possible that this guy who was
murdered is trying to communicate me,

767
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,655
with me from the, from beyond the grave,

768
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,715
and I just came for a
reading, or for your help

769
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,693
if you're able to... - Okay.

770
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,262
My reading is $20.

771
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:26,124
- Okay, here's the twenty bucks.

772
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,593
So, you're a real psychic?
- Yes, I am.

773
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,271
- Okay.
- I've been reading for 40 years.

774
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,398
- Okay, so, can you

775
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,833
- Let's see what my cards tell me.

776
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,301
- Okay.

777
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,404
- You know, what
I would advise you is,

778
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,382
because this person is
trying to contact you

779
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,875
from the other side...

780
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,252
- So he is?

781
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,778
- Is making you feel discomfortable.

782
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:54,685
Sometimes people's minds,
okay, work differently,

783
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,755
because maybe sometime in your past

784
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:03,261
or sometime in your childhood,
maybe you lost somebody,

785
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,597
or wanted to be with somebody
or was trying to contact somebody

786
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:11,311
and you couldn't and
maybe what you feel is that,

787
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,815
that is confusing you and troubling you.

788
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,918
And maybe you should just let it go

789
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,044
and not pursue it further

790
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,355
because it might cause you

791
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:27,051
more drama and make you
feel more discomfortable

792
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,096
in the future.

793
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,965
- Well, look,
I just, I have to know

794
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:35,002
what the answer to the inconsistencies

795
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,460
about this investigation are.

796
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,173
Do you know about this
stuff, like, what's?

797
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,142
- Well, you know son,
psychics feel

798
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,168
and sometimes know a lot of things.

799
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,403
Okay?

800
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:49,207
But sometimes to pursue everything in life
is not always the best thing.

801
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,509
- Well, what
does he want though?

802
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,221
- There's no telling
what this person wants.

803
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,314
- Is there anything I can do
to figure that out?

804
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,958
Or anything you can do?

805
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,084
- Well, you know, son,
there are a lot of things

806
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,696
that a person could do,
but I would suggest to you

807
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,988
just to leave it alone.

808
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:05,957
Just leave it alone.

809
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,869
Just try to be strong and positive

810
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,205
and don't listen to anybody or any voices

811
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,473
that tell you to pursue this.

812
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,577
- How do I get him to stop
if I'm not supposed to go on with this?

813
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,935
- You know, son, let me tell you.

814
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,672
Sometimes the signs that you
see are not put there for you.

815
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,046
Maybe you just think that
they're there for you

816
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:26,520
and the signs are telling
you this, but they're not.

817
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,614
I'm suggesting to you,
give it up, leave it alone.

818
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,649
- Okay well I-
- Don't pursue it.

819
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,084
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

820
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,720
Maybe she's just right.
You know...

821
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,856
What's fucked up is she clearly knew

822
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,902
about my mother dying when I was a kid

823
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,271
and that connection that I felt.

824
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,472
That this is the same thing
I'm feeling right now.

825
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:50,468
I'm just, why can't I, what's
wrong with me finding out

826
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,912
what's happening around here?

827
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,880
I mean, I just want to
know what's going on. Okay?

828
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,873
Okay now look at this. Okay?

829
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,418
How am I supposed to ignore this?
Okay?

830
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,054
This is clearly written for me.

831
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:04,215
I know that the pastor
and the pastors are bad. Okay?

832
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:07,285
I know that the pastors are bad men
and I'm supposed to avoid them.

833
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:10,054
I understand the warning, but why?

834
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,166
I feel like the reason
that this message is here

835
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,037
is maybe to get me to come
back to the scaffolding

836
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,706
and find the person
who wrote the graffiti.

837
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,570
I'm coming back tonight.
I'm gonna stake it out

838
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,635
and we're gonna settle this
once and for all.

839
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:29,073
This graffiti from earlier,
somebody's ripped it down.

840
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,976
Is this supposed to
be another sign for me?

841
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,989
I'm telling you, I have
a feeling that tonight

842
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,158
I'm supposed to find this guy.

843
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:39,917
I'm supposed to meet him here.

844
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,720
Uh. It's happening tonight,
it's happening tonight.

845
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:47,958
I think this guy has taken
the night off tonight. So...

846
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:52,830
Well, if it's not gonna be the guy who
wrote the graffiti then it's gonna be...

847
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:57,335
you know, the person whose blood was
out on the side of the street

848
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,338
or it's gonna be the lady with the couch
who's come back from the dead.

849
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,973
Again, the blood.

850
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,776
I know I'm not even
supposed to be here but

851
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,978
the scene of the crime again.

852
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,715
Still no couch, still no lady.

853
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,860
I'll go to each and every place

854
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,387
that I can possibly find anybody tonight

855
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,833
and I'm just gonna keep
on going back and forth

856
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:23,603
to these spots until I find the person

857
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,996
that I'm supposed to meet. Okay?

858
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,034
Back here in the alley
where she was arrested.

859
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,981
You probably can't hear me over these
fucking helicopters either.

860
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,508
Jesus fucking Christ, go away.

861
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,490
Am I supposed to meet you here?

862
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,427
- Am I supposed
to meet you here?

863
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,197
- I don't know, you tell me.

864
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,067
- I don't know, you tell me.

865
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:08,105
- Do you know anything
about what happened with the murder?

866
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,475
- Do you know anything about
what happened with the murder?

867
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,844
- You're just gonna repeat
everything that I say to you?

868
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,088
- Yeah.

869
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:17,615
- I think I'm
supposed to be here with you.

870
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,450
- Time out, are you making a movie?

871
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,119
I've been to 'Nam,
cut me a break.

872
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,723
Jesus Christ, it was a murder?

873
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,069
- It was a murder.
A woman murdered her husband.

874
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:33,197
- Oh, man, what the fuck is going on?

875
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,375
What town is this by the way?

876
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,676
- This is Koreatown.

877
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,112
- Oh, Koreatown, no wonder.

878
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:41,872
Jesus Christ.
A lot of murders happen in

879
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,275
Koreatown that people
don't even know about.

880
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,577
- You were here in this alley
the night of the murder?

881
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,821
- Hey, buddy, I don't know.

882
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,023
I must have been if that
was the purple flash

883
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:53,217
was the murder weapon fire discharging.

884
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,695
If it was, I don't know for sure.

885
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:59,032
I didn't hear a sound,
but I saw the light.

886
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,625
But it was purple in color
and it was up that way,

887
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:06,197
up into the sky from inside
that garage over there.

888
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,975
- And it has
to do with the murder?

889
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:12,303
- I guess, if that's what
you're investigating.

890
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:16,917
But I saw three figures inside the garage

891
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,085
during the flash.

892
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,253
I got keen eyes.

893
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,846
I've been to 'Nam.

894
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:26,293
So listen, buddy, I'm
telling you the truth.

895
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,527
Do you doubt my word?

896
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:28,562
- No.

897
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,131
- Okay, that's important news.

898
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:36,260
Since Cambodia, it's called
the People's Outdoor Court.

899
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:39,039
It's as good as in the court of law.

900
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,074
- Where did it
come from, which garage?

901
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:44,268
- The one back there, one
of the, how many of them are?

902
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,213
- Will you point it out?
Will you point it to me?

903
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,838
- Four or five, that one over there.

904
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:53,010
- I can't see anything.
Which one was it?

905
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,646
- One of them.
I don't know which one it was.

906
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,949
- His name was Tae Kyung Sung.

907
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,928
- Oh, I know
that guy, Tae Kyung Sung.

908
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:05,523
I know him personally from overseas.

909
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,858
- How'd you meet him?
- No, he was one of our group.

910
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:13,097
- I believe
that the spirit of the man who was killed

911
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,866
has been communicating with me
from the other side

912
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,869
- Okay.
- And leading me toward,

913
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:22,916
The... whatever he wants me to see...
- The other side of the poetic wall

914
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,009
- Yes, that's true,
probably true.

915
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,977
Lots of ghosts are like this.

916
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,246
They don't even realize they're dead.

917
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,881
They don't even know they're dead!

918
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,127
- Do you think that
we've met here for a reason?

919
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:37,030
- I think more than one reason.

920
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,890
I think we're meant to be here together

921
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,859
to solve this problem.

922
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,696
Do you think I'm going
on the right direction here?

923
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,108
- The right direction
with your investigation?

924
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:48,976
- Yeah.

925
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,645
- Oh yeah, I
think you're right on target,

926
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:56,116
locked on, ready to fire, as
they say in the Air Force.

927
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,185
Push the red button and you got them.

928
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,911
- Anything else?

929
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:03,147
- It's all coming down on you, buddy.

930
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,727
- What's coming down on me?

931
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:12,265
- Well, I
heard somebody say that today.

932
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,801
That's the only reason I mentioned it.

933
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:17,037
It's almost over.

934
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,862
I'm an expert witness.

935
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:22,909
I've been a witness before,
especially in Cambodia

936
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,579
where we did people's court.

937
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:30,040
In the evening, just before supper.

938
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,247
- I can't
overstate the significance

939
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:05,218
of last night and there's
a lot that went down

940
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,654
and a lot to decompress.

941
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,857
All of my suspicions have been confirmed,

942
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:13,326
that something else has happened

943
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,930
and there's weird shit going
on in this neighborhood.

944
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:21,935
You know, I feel validated right
now in this pursuit,

945
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:25,138
like this stuff really has
been happening for a reason,

946
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,765
like I've been chosen for something.

947
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:29,976
Something went down in this alley.

948
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,580
Something big went down in this alley.

949
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:36,049
I'm gonna find out what it was.

950
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,184
The reason that she was
arrested so far back here

951
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,654
in the alley is because her garage,

952
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,980
this must be her garage up here.

953
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,082
I'm just gonna...

954
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,853
This is sketchy as fuck,
okay well, something,

955
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,698
something went down in this garage

956
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:55,268
and I'm almost positive
this is her garage.

957
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,695
I have to come back tonight
and see what's in there.

958
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,839
I have to know.

959
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,832
Can I do that?
Am I gonna get in trouble?

960
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,902
I'm almost positive,
this has been triangulated

961
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,913
that there was a third person here

962
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:10,417
with the blood and whoever it was,

963
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:13,887
was in the garage with the
murder victim and the murderer.

964
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,846
Who was this third person?

965
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,817
I have to do this before
my girlfriend gets home.

966
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,552
It's not even dark out yet, I don't...

967
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:24,030
Let me get, hold on, I have
to turn this flash off.

968
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,356
It's too bright, okay.

969
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:39,236
Oh shit.

970
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:43,373
Okay, there's people up there.

971
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,610
This is too sketchy.

972
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,888
I...

973
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,281
There's no way I'm
breaking into this garage tonight.

974
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,818
I'm done filming for the night.
My girlfriend will be home any minute.

975
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,153
I need to go in the garage

976
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:58,055
But I'm gonna do through
the proper channel.

977
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,958
So, I put in a search with the city

978
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:03,536
for the property owner's information.

979
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,406
So, I can just contact the
landlord of this place.

980
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,909
It will be a couple days
so I asked this guy, Jack,

981
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,078
maybe he can give me
the information faster.

982
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:16,182
And if not, there's one other
thing that I really need

983
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:19,819
to get done right now,
which is I just realized,

984
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:22,422
so this guy, the guy from the alley,

985
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:27,660
I talked to him for hours
and I forgot to ask him

986
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,629
one of the most important questions

987
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:32,599
which is if he knows
anything about the pastors.

988
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:36,436
And it's really weird
it just kinda like slipped my mind.

989
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,240
And I'm almost sure that he
lives in one of the alleys

990
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,175
adjacent to this, to my alley.

991
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,644
So, I'm gonna go find this guy

992
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:46,937
and ask him a couple more questions.

993
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,874
I don't know where he goes when it rains.

994
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:58,649
Yes.

995
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:00,450
- It is?
- Yeah.

996
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,530
- How's it going, my friend?
- Is it still raining?

997
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,031
- No, it stopped raining.

998
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:07,834
- Yeah, I remember now,
you were talking to me

999
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,837
about your girlfriend being
murdered or something like that.

1000
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,230
- Well, it was
about my neighbor's murder...

1001
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,575
- Oh man, it's a wicked
town, man, it happens.

1002
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,378
- Well, so but, I just,
there are two things so...

1003
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:21,047
Well, first of all, you really saw

1004
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:22,749
the three people in the garage?

1005
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:25,275
- I told you the truth
about what I witnessed, sir.

1006
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,053
- Okay, so you weren't just
liquored up or something?

1007
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,412
- No, I'm...
- You really saw it?

1008
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:32,125
- I was wide awake. I saw what
I saw and I told you what I saw.

1009
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:34,384
- Okay, well,
do you know anything

1010
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:36,362
about the pastors? By the
way, that's the reason...

1011
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,031
- Pastors, I never met a pastor.

1012
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:39,999
I haven't met a pastor.

1013
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,501
- Okay, so you
don't know anything about that?

1014
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,594
- I've met preachers but
I haven't met a pastor.

1015
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,372
- - It's a little bit...
- Nobody with a official hat on.

1016
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,473
- Okay, it's too crazy for me

1017
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,609
to really tell you about
if you don't know already.

1018
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,001
- I just don't know about it.

1019
00:47:54,771 --> 00:48:00,177
- I just had
a repeat of the same dream

1020
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:05,015
and this time, this is
gonna sound so weird,

1021
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:08,252
he reached out and he grabbed my arm.

1022
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,721
And now, look at this.

1023
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,590
You see that?

1024
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:17,527
It looks like a burn or something.

1025
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,930
Okay, this is new.

1026
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,700
I am getting a really weird vibe today

1027
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,636
and I don't like it.

1028
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,582
You know, this is making me nervous.

1029
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,526
I feel like these guys
are following me around

1030
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,529
and I already know that they're bad men

1031
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:46,657
and to avoid them, so I'm
just gonna turn around

1032
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:47,891
and walk the other way.

1033
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,436
I just have this very weird
paranoid feeling right now

1034
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,930
like something is out to get me.

1035
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,166
See, they are, they're
following me around. Okay?

1036
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,701
I almost wanna just go up to the guy,

1037
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,294
ask him what the fuck he wants from me.

1038
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:02,773
I just want to know who they are,

1039
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:04,074
what they want from me

1040
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,776
and what they have to
do with the murder.

1041
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,111
You see this from earlier?

1042
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,580
You see this reflection?

1043
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,684
It's like the next level
of weird shit going on.

1044
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:14,751
Look at this.

1045
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:20,057
They all look at me at the same time.

1046
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:22,826
Okay, one more time.

1047
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,931
What the fuck?

1048
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,370
Great so now we got chicken sacrifices.

1049
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:36,506
Just a beautiful day in the neighborhood

1050
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:40,377
where people have been
sacrificing chickens apparently.

1051
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,223
Everything is fine in
Koreatown right now.

1052
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,683
Everything is peachy keen.

1053
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:52,689
This is horrible, oh my God.

1054
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,994
The guy who I interviewed...

1055
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:02,566
uh the actor who just
moved here from Florida...

1056
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:04,935
he killed himself.

1057
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:08,839
Does this look like the kind
of guy who kills himself?

1058
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:10,583
I feel horrible.

1059
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,075
I feel like this is my fault.

1060
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:18,982
Burn update.
It's not getting any better.

1061
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:23,286
This I don't like at all.
I just want to fucking...

1062
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,288
one second.

1063
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:28,835
So, the landlord
of their apartment building

1064
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,138
lives in the building behind
me, this building right here

1065
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:33,897
which he also owns.

1066
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,809
And he has a store in Koreatown as well.

1067
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,970
And I'm gonna go there right
now and ask him some questions.

1068
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:47,110
What the fuck is this place?

1069
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:51,515
- Hello?

1070
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:53,726
- Hi.

1071
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,396
- Yeah, are you the landlord
of 1100 Menlo Avenue?

1072
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,031
- Yes.

1073
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,899
- Yeah, I have
some questions because

1074
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:02,068
I'm doing an investigation into the murder

1075
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,936
that happened at your apartment complex

1076
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,472
and the suicide that just
occurred a couple days ago.

1077
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:07,774
- Excuse me, what this?
- Uh, it's a...

1078
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:08,932
- What's that camera?

1079
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,510
- Okay look.
I'm not filming you.

1080
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,236
There's something fucking weird
going on in your apartment complex

1081
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:19,185
and I have information to believe
that it all is centered in a garage.

1082
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:20,987
Do I have your permission
to enter the garage?

1083
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:21,878
- Please.

1084
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,790
- Okay, do I have your
permission to enter the garage?

1085
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:26,483
- No, no, please, please leave.
- Why not?

1086
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,694
Why can't I enter the garage?

1087
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:31,054
- Because I know nothing about that issues.

1088
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,131
- Okay, well
you don't think it's weird

1089
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:34,434
that people have been dying
at your apartment complex?

1090
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:35,968
- I'm asking you to put the camera down.

1091
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:38,871
- Okay, I'm putting it down
but why can't I go into the garage?

1092
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:40,297
Give me a clear answer.

1093
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,732
- I don't know,
just, I don't like to...

1094
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,569
I don't like you to be involved
in this anymore.

1095
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,280
- But why don't you
want me to be involved in it?

1096
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:48,939
I just have to know the truth.
Okay?

1097
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,751
Just tell me, where were you
on the night of the murder? Okay?

1098
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,415
You fit the description of this third man

1099
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,788
who was in the garage with the
murder victim and his wife.

1100
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,824
- Okay, I need to call up the police.

1101
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:58,792
- Okay, well, call the police

1102
00:51:58,816 --> 00:52:00,593
and bring them here and then
we're gonna go to the garage

1103
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,462
and we're gonna find whatever
evidence is in there.

1104
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,729
- You're bothering my business.
Okay?

1105
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:04,931
- Yeah, there's nobody in here

1106
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,724
except for her and who the fuck
is that fuck is that, by the way? Huh?

1107
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,502
- Please, I am asking you to leave.

1108
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:11,962
- Okay...
- Please leave.

1109
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:19,011
This guy is one of them,
this guy is one of them.

1110
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:22,172
He is one of them, he is one of them.

1111
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:24,050
- Are you one of the pastors?
- Get out. Get out.

1112
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,952
Where were you on the night of the murder?

1113
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,421
- I'm asking you to get
out, okay, just get out.

1114
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,156
- This guy
is one of the pastors!

1115
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:34,751
It's a cult or something, it's
a cult, it's a cult!

1116
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:35,886
Fuck.

1117
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,464
I know he's hiding
something in the garage.

1118
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,233
I know he was there on
the night of the murder.

1119
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:42,502
This guy might as well be
the fucking ring leader

1120
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:45,304
of this organization or
whatever the fuck it is.

1121
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,130
This is what I'm worried about.
Okay?

1122
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,775
It's possible that I've
been misinterpreting

1123
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:52,812
this whole thing and
the man who was killed,

1124
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:56,349
that he has been warning
me this whole time

1125
00:52:56,373 --> 00:53:00,319
and either the guy who
was murdered wants me

1126
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,455
to go to the garage and
find out what's in there

1127
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:05,591
and expose the truth so
that way no one else is hurt

1128
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:09,452
or it's like I'm being lured into a trap.

1129
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,087
Okay?

1130
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:13,790
It's the middle of the night.

1131
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,825
I don't want to wake up my girlfriend but,

1132
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:20,430
that's gotta be the
landlord's apartment building.

1133
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:24,701
Something really fucking crazy
is going on in this neighborhood.

1134
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,816
I think that I've figured
out a pattern here

1135
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,654
and it's not good and it
all has to do with how

1136
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:36,880
I found out about this.

1137
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,526
Okay, so, I had the dream.

1138
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,562
I saw the graffiti.

1139
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:48,124
I saw the pastor and the lady
with the couch went missing.

1140
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:53,039
Okay, let's fast forward
a couple days ago.

1141
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,409
I had the dream with the burn.

1142
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,378
I saw this Satanic graffiti.

1143
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:04,874
I saw the pastor and
this guy kills himself.

1144
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,252
Okay?

1145
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:07,853
It's the time in the middle that is

1146
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:11,090
a little bit off with this pattern.

1147
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:14,026
I don't know if anybody died that night,

1148
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:19,756
but I had the dream, I saw the graffiti,

1149
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,959
and who did I see that night?

1150
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,962
Who told me about the purple light?

1151
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:30,500
And who led me toward
investigating the garage?

1152
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,814
Okay?
Do you get where I'm going here?

1153
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:35,872
I have to know.

1154
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,980
Hey,

1155
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,950
Now I'm gonna ask you a question

1156
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:49,953
and I want a truthful answer from you.

1157
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,565
Are you one of the pastors?

1158
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:53,723
- Yes.

1159
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:57,637
- Leave me alone.

1160
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:01,131
- I will.

1161
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:04,367
- Don't talk to me anymore.
I don't want to see you in my alley.

1162
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,679
I should have known from the beginning

1163
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:10,040
and I am just way in
over my head right now

1164
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:11,608
and I am just fucked is what I am.

1165
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,220
I don't even know what I'm gonna do now.

1166
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:16,756
I feel like there are two factions

1167
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,159
fighting for control over my mind.

1168
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:22,695
And this investigation
has to end right now.

1169
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,196
This is my last video.

1170
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,564
I don't give a fuck what's in the garage.

1171
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,824
I'm never going back to that alley again.

1172
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:28,892
Thanks for watching.

1173
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,002
I can't sleep.

1174
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:43,616
I just... need to stand here

1175
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,275
and watch over her.

1176
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:46,443
I feel like if I don't

1177
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:48,044
then something horrible
is gonna happen.

1178
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,480
Like they're going to
come get her or something.

1179
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:56,720
I'm spending some quality time
with her this weekend.

1180
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,956
And I'm going
to ignore this investigation.

1181
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,458
And unless

1182
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:03,269
Tae Kyung Sung shows me

1183
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,562
a true proper sign

1184
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:08,031
then this investigation is still over.

1185
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:12,168
My relationship is in shambles.
My life is in shambles.

1186
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,238
And I need this to end.

1187
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:16,806
I'm done.

1188
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,538
Hold on a sec.

1189
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:07,924
Holy shit.

1190
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:08,892
What's wrong with you?

1191
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,560
- No look we
have to go right now okay?

1192
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,195
Why? I'm waiting for my food.

1193
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:13,506
Wait why? - We're not safe here.

1194
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,599
- What's wrong with you?
- Okay fine I'll meet you out front.

1195
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,774
I haven't really
finished my investigation.

1196
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:26,242
Wait, no no no. Just stop,

1197
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,753
I haven't been
completely honest with you.

1198
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:30,113
And I have to show you I haven't...
- No. Stop.

1199
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:31,781
Just stop filming.
Stop filming this.

1200
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:34,551
Somebody else has to see this
because I'm not...

1201
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:37,830
No, you do care. Okay?
Because it has to do with our safety.

1202
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:40,323
And what I've seen tonight
with one of the pastors...

1203
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:41,867
- No. Stop filming me...
- Means that something bad

1204
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,493
Is gonna happen tonight...
- No. Stop...

1205
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:44,937
And I'm the only one
who can stop it.

1206
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,539
Okay?
- No. Stop filming. Stop filming me.

1207
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:49,232
- The spirit of
the guy who was murdered

1208
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:51,201
has been communicating with me

1209
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:54,313
and his presence
is here right now and I can feel it.

1210
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:55,448
Okay?

1211
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,840
And I have been chosen

1212
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:59,442
to stop whatever bad
is supposed to happen tonight

1213
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,910
from happening. Okay? Do you...

1214
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:03,079
No. No, just, you've gone insane.

1215
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,882
He's here.

1216
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:13,756
Tae Kyung Sung.

1217
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,759
If this is you

1218
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:19,062
and you're trying
to communicate with me

1219
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,631
show me a sign.

1220
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,069
Whoa.

1221
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:30,740
Are you seeing this?

1222
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,678
Do you believe me now?

1223
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,416
Do you want me
to go to the garage?

1224
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,786
Is there a piece of evidence
there for me to find?

1225
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,365
I have to break in there...
- Please don't go.

1226
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:58,902
I have to go.

1227
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:21,057
Hey buddy...

1228
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,268
Come on over. Hey everybody

1229
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:25,128
check it out man,
I'm talking to the rats.

1230
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:28,107
Don't worry I can hear you.
You're sloshing your feet too.

1231
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,866
Must be wet up there.

1232
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,634
Hey buddy down here.

1233
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,070
Why don't you come down
here and join us?

1234
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:37,416
Stay out of trouble for a while,
warm your cockles.

1235
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,243
Look buddy I got some
really good news for you.

1236
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:43,079
You're this close to
nabbing the crook.

1237
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:47,784
Hey I know what,
let's talk a walk upstream a bit.

1238
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:51,154
Look there goes a couple of rats.
Hi Suzie...

1239
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:55,391
Anyway uh yeah,
let's walk up the shelf a little bit.

1240
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,360
Hobo's hit your row.

1241
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:00,730
Why don't you break into
that garage over there?

1242
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,166
You might find something
that'll help you.

1243
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:05,911
It's the perfect
time, it's raining.

1244
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,136
They'll never know.

1245
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,872
They won't even
see fingerprints if it's raining.

1246
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,741
Go to the garage.

1247
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:14,611
Break the lock. Open the door.

1248
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:15,678
Go inside.

1249
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:19,024
Make sure you collect
the evidence you need

1250
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:20,783
and then get out of there.

1251
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:22,518
And then it's sealed.

1252
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,554
For your humanity's sake...

1253
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,656
Do it. Do what we recommend.

1254
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,791
We don't mean
to tell you what to do

1255
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:29,969
like a 'straw boss'.

1256
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:32,962
But please, take our advice.

1257
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:39,002
It's King Kong crying
over your dead soul if you don't do it.

1258
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:16,799
I'm going to pass out.

1259
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:35,694
Okay I just woke up and I have
a huge fucking problem which is that

1260
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:39,288
And I don't know
where my girlfriend is.

1261
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:42,492
I don't remember exactly
what happened last night but...

1262
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:46,229
I think that she's mad at me at she's...
left.

1263
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:49,908
Something fucking bad happened...

1264
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,969
Something really bad fucking
happened and I don't know what to do.

1265
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:00,977
It's just really not like her
and she won't answer my calls and...

1266
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:03,346
I don't know
what the fuck happened last night.

1267
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,281
All I know is...

1268
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,785
I heard that wretched voice
coming from the sewer.

1269
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:16,225
Where is she?

1270
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:19,495
Are you down there still?

1271
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,466
Hello?

1272
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:35,077
- Hey it's Jen,
leave a message or send me a text. Bye.

1273
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:38,214
I feel like I saw
the landlord in the garage

1274
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:40,183
and he assaulted me.

1275
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:43,152
So as soon as it stops raining
I'm gonna go pay this guy a fucking visit.

1276
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:44,854
Look at this...

1277
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:48,558
Do you see this crack...
Hold on let me turn on the light here.

1278
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:56,365
Do you see this in my ceiling?
This crack in my ceiling!?

1279
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,768
This doesn't make any sense. Okay.

1280
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:03,406
At 10:08 is when I
recorded the video

1281
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:06,318
of my encounter with the
landlord in there.

1282
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:11,881
And then at 11:09 I left the garage,
I ran out of the garage...

1283
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,826
What the fuck happened to
me in there for an hour?

1284
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,352
Okay? What did he do to me?

1285
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,542
Hello?

1286
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:41,177
Uh who are you?

1287
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,079
I'm John. - Uh yeah

1288
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:45,648
I'm looking for the landlord who
I saw last night in the garage

1289
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:48,193
before my fucking girlfriend
went missing!

1290
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,653
- Last night happened something very bad.

1291
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,889
- Uh yeah well where's the landlord?

1292
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,991
He's... he's dead. - How?

1293
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:57,827
-I don't know, maybe a suicide.

1294
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,439
- He's not in here?
- No, he's not here now.

1295
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:03,032
Do you know what's going
on in this neighborhood

1296
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,701
with the pastors or any
of this other bullshit?

1297
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,770
- I don't know.

1298
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:09,572
It's okay?

1299
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,440
- No it's not okay. Okay?

1300
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:12,742
He's really dead?

1301
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:14,343
- Yeah he's really dead.

1302
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,384
The feeling I had with him is gone.

1303
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:24,654
And all I feel now...

1304
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:28,024
is nothing.

1305
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,133
- Hello?
- Can I help you?

1306
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:40,536
- Yeah my name is Sam,
I'm a friend of Jen's. I just wanna...

1307
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:43,072
come in and talk to you for a second.

1308
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:45,517
- Do you know where she is?

1309
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:48,253
- I don't that's why I want to talk.

1310
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,478
- Uh...

1311
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:51,981
How do you know her?
- I'm a family friend.

1312
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:53,454
- Look if you don't
know where she is

1313
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:55,818
then there's nothing
you can do to help.

1314
01:05:58,087 --> 01:05:59,889
- Open the door please.

1315
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,436
Her fucking family thinks
I've done something to her.

1316
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,895
I haven't done anything to her.

1317
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:08,564
I don't know what happened okay?
I don't know where she is.

1318
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:10,232
What the fuck am I going to do?

1319
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:14,971
- Fuck.

1320
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:35,891
He's coming upstairs.

1321
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:41,731
Okay. Here we are going to file
a missing persons report for my girlfriend

1322
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,699
at the request of the police.

1323
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:47,970
Well the police
think that I'm crazy.

1324
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:52,408
Uh yes, there's some weird
supernatural occurrences going on

1325
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:55,478
and my fucking girlfriend
has gone missing.

1326
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:59,081
What do you think the first
thing that comes out of their mouth is?

1327
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:01,017
Well where were you?
What were you doing?

1328
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:04,396
Surely there's gotta be somebody in this
town who can help me with this problem

1329
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,856
somebody who knows something
more about the pastors

1330
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:10,026
somebody who can
help me find my girlfriend.

1331
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:11,394
- Stay away. Stay away.

1332
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,030
- Just, I can't give you a reading
there's nothing I can do!

1333
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:18,300
I can't sleep.

1334
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:24,006
I'm going right now
to try to find the guy from the alley

1335
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:27,552
and when I find him,
I'm going to do this to him

1336
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:29,345
I'm gonna go
smash his fucking face in.

1337
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,163
Okay great now
this guy has gone missing too.

1338
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:40,623
The guy from the alley
is now officially missing

1339
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:42,096
because this is
where he used to live

1340
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:44,527
before he started
talking to me from the sewer

1341
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:49,331
Now look at this. Okay this alley
is blocked off by a bunch of rubbage.

1342
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:52,368
How is this possible?

1343
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,584
- Hallelujah!

1344
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:18,060
Holy shit.

1345
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:21,063
Hey!

1346
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:48,290
- I don't know what to do.

1347
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,629
I almost forgot she was gone.

1348
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,347
The police are out to get me.

1349
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:14,250
Like what the fuck do you do
when the police are out to get you?

1350
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:23,292
They're searching my garage.

1351
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,329
She's not in there, I already checked.

1352
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:29,231
I know she's not fucking in there.

1353
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:31,943
The next logical conclusion
they're going to come fucking arrest me.

1354
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:33,636
I'm so fucked here.

1355
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,573
Holy shit I'm fucked.

1356
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:41,343
The only thing I can do is try
to find the guy from the alley again.

1357
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:44,079
He's the only person who
knows anything about what's going on here.

1358
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:47,183
If I can't find the guy from the alley,
I'm going back to my apartment

1359
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,919
and I'm going to go hang myself
before the police arrest me.

1360
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:55,691
- I hear you coming.

1361
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,159
- Hello?

1362
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,970
Come on buddy get over here.

1363
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:00,729
- How do I get to the other side?

1364
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,872
What do you want from me?

1365
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:12,775
- I don't want anything from you, not me.

1366
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:15,778
- Well who does?
- You got any beans? Refried beans?

1367
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,715
- How do I get my girlfriend back?
- How about a tank of propane?

1368
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:21,116
- How do I get my girlfriend back?

1369
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:23,819
- You might have to wait another lifetime.
- How do I get her back?

1370
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:26,455
- Get her back?
You can't bring back the dead.

1371
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:27,890
Are you some kind of saint?

1372
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:29,325
- Who says she's dead?

1373
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,802
- I didn't say so...
- I didn't do anything to her

1374
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:33,829
- Any of you rats so so?
We didn't say so.

1375
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,540
We ain't accusing you of nothing.

1376
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:39,001
We're the people's court.
We're fair and just.

1377
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,646
- How did you get down there?
- We're not...

1378
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:44,106
You're accused
of murdering someone though.

1379
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,741
Or so we hear...

1380
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,376
- How did you get down there?

1381
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:50,312
- I come down a secret passage.
My own passage.

1382
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:53,382
Everyone has their own
separate rabbit hole you know.

1383
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,385
- How did you get
into the sewer the other night?

1384
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:00,789
- Well you're here now. How did
you get down? Through the manhole?

1385
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:02,091
Did you do something to her?

1386
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:04,964
- I didn't do anything to her.
- Do you know about what happened to her?

1387
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:06,495
- I've been down here for months.

1388
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:07,863
- What is happening?

1389
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:11,600
- I'm just withering down here.
- What happened to me in the garage?

1390
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:14,403
- What happened to you in the garage?
- When I went to the garage.

1391
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:15,938
- Oh...

1392
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:18,674
- I saw a glow
that lasted for a minute.

1393
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:21,610
A purple glow coming from the window.

1394
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,055
So maybe you killed
her maybe you didn't.

1395
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:26,015
Maybe you killed her in
an absent minded state.

1396
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:29,785
- I didn't kill anybody, I'm innocent.
- Well that's what you remember...

1397
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:32,688
Maybe you did it
in an absent minded state.

1398
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:35,090
I think you did it though.

1399
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,992
I think you did it.

1400
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,428
Cause you were in that place
and anyone who...

1401
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:43,275
Even an innocent person is guilty
once they're in there

1402
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,267
of killing someone
close to themselves.

1403
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,545
There's a long history of that place,

1404
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:51,483
that particular garage is haunted somehow

1405
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:53,275
it's cursed even,

1406
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:56,945
that people who go in there commit murder.

1407
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:59,548
They could give you time

1408
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:02,885
they could give you life
if they really wanted to.

1409
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:05,554
You stay here we'll give you free life.

1410
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,323
You wanna stay?

1411
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:08,824
Stay outta trouble?

1412
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:10,059
Stay with us.

1413
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:11,903
- You're guilty bud.

1414
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:13,929
You're guilty as charged.

1415
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:17,199
Unless you present evidence
to the contrary.

1416
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:19,735
- I didn't do anything
what are you talking about?

1417
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:22,137
What do you want from me?

1418
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,773
- Just do
what we recommend, we're doctors.

1419
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:30,245
Doctor's recommendation:
go to the garage...

1420
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:32,614
and find the evidence you need.

1421
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:35,260
This garage is haunted!

1422
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:37,186
It's run by the pastors!

1423
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:38,620
It's a portal to hell!

1424
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:42,291
People are talking to me
from the sewers!

1425
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:46,228
There's a portal to hell
in my neighbor's garage!

1426
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:50,232
It's cursed, run by the pastors!

1427
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:52,977
They talk to me from the sewers!

1428
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:55,237
My girlfriend's gone missing!

1429
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:57,940
My neighbor's garage is cursed!

1430
01:12:57,973 --> 01:12:59,708
There's a portal to hell inside!

1431
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:01,877
It's run by the pastors!

1432
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:04,179
They talk to me from the sewers!

1433
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,548
Now my girlfriend's gone missing!

1434
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:28,470
I didn't kill her!

1435
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,140
What do you want from me?

1436
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:33,842
What do you want from me?

1437
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,378
What do you want from me?

1438
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,480
What do you want from me?

1439
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:54,572
It has become clear
that I have traveled

1440
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:56,365
to a new distant world.

1441
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,734
And I am rapidly approaching the end

1442
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:00,202
of my investigation into

1443
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:02,604
into the murder of
Tae Kyung Sung.

1444
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:05,107
There is no one left to help me.

1445
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:08,844
And it's only a matter of time
before the police arrest me.

1446
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:13,682
My only recourse is to present
the evidence as clearly as possible.

1447
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,852
This will be my last video.

1448
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:17,886
When I'm finished,

1449
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,923
I will ship the footage to a friend
along with my notes.

1450
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:23,592
Because if this information
doesn't get out...

1451
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:26,261
More people will go missing...

1452
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,163
And more people will die.

1453
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:31,066
I have discovered
a series of pictures on my phone

1454
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:33,669
which I do not remember taking.

1455
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:36,305
Pictures that helped me crack the case.

1456
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:39,208
At the end of this recording
I will share them.

1457
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:40,852
But first...

1458
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:43,479
I'll take one last walk
to those familiar places.

1459
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,484
Back to their apartment
where Tae Kyung Sung's body was found.

1460
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:51,587
The man who communicated with me
from another world...

1461
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,956
maybe the one I'm in now.

1462
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:56,758
You touched me and I felt you.

1463
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:00,028
But I'm afraid I
felt something that wasn't true.

1464
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:05,000
I'm now confident that
his only communications were warnings.

1465
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,345
Like the burn on my arm

1466
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:09,080
Where he reached out...

1467
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:10,439
with whatever last bit of energy

1468
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:12,617
he had left in his former world.

1469
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:14,977
In a last ditch effort to save me.

1470
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,846
And everything I felt after that

1471
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,314
like the wind blowing in bathroom

1472
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:22,084
the night I was
lured into the garage

1473
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:24,529
wasn't coming from him at all

1474
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:28,257
it was coming from the pastors
or maybe the garage itself.

1475
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:31,593
Back to the scaffolding
where I found the graffiti.

1476
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:34,429
Where I was surprised to
learn that all those messages

1477
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:36,398
were most likely written by the landlord

1478
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:38,834
even after he was dead.

1479
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:40,936
Which seems impossible

1480
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,304
but not here.

1481
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:44,549
He prayed on my curiosity

1482
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:46,241
Knowing that I would take the bait

1483
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:50,145
his shiny shoes gave him away.

1484
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,848
I believe he brought the shopkeeper

1485
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:56,785
and the shopkeepers mother
from Africa to be sacrificed next.

1486
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:59,087
I want to believe that I saved them.

1487
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:02,508
Back to where I found
the blood on the front of the street.

1488
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,393
The landlord's blood.

1489
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,396
Also known as the mysterious 3rd man.

1490
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:08,730
Who after a skirmish

1491
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:11,533
with Tae Sung and his wife
in their apartment

1492
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,869
Stopped to check on his wound

1493
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,370
spewed his blood

1494
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:16,772
then ran home.

1495
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:20,275
Back to the alley where she was arrested.

1496
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:23,054
Where the pastor
spoke to me from the sewer.

1497
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,747
Where she ran after
realizing what had happened.

1498
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:27,950
And finally...

1499
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,152
Back to the garage.

1500
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:33,088
Where there exists some sort
of evil entity

1501
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:37,559
or portal to hell or new dimension
where your worst fears come true.

1502
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,228
Speculating about
it is pointless.

1503
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:45,467
It is impossible to understand because
it is an illogical hateful place.

1504
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:48,337
But I am certain that
there are more of these places.

1505
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:52,641
And more pastors who tend to them
as part of a supernatural cult.

1506
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:54,576
To enter alone is not enough.

1507
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:56,778
I believe a pastor must be present

1508
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:59,481
for the ritual or whatever it is,
to occur.

1509
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:01,350
The landlord served this function

1510
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:04,119
on the night of
Tae Kyung Sung's murder

1511
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:05,787
But the couple fought back

1512
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:07,956
because they were strong...

1513
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:09,725
much stronger than me.

1514
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:12,527
But not strong enough
to fend off the pastor's spell

1515
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:16,198
which caused Misun Yoo
to stab her husband.

1516
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:18,934
Apparently in an absent minded state.

1517
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:21,470
But not without
stabbing the landlord first.

1518
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:23,839
So now I'll take one last trip

1519
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:26,108
back to those familiar places.

1520
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:28,443
Back to where his body as found.

1521
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:31,747
Back to where I found the blood
on the front street.

1522
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:35,050
Back to the alley where she was arrested.

1523
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,618
And back to the garage.

1524
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:39,187
Armed with new regretful knowledge.

1525
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:41,723
The evidence that
helped me crack the case.

1526
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:45,794
The pictures on my phone which
I don't remember taking.

1527
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:49,698
And now I know the truth of
what happened to Tae Kyung Sung...

1528
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:52,267
and my girlfriend.

1529
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:55,291
