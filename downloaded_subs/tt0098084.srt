1
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:46,837
Bye, old Shep.
See you in heaven, yep?

2
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,390
This is where my kitty lays

3
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,100
No more he screams and hollers

4
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,603
He lived for five and 20 days

5
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,480
And cost me 50 dollars

6
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,027
Spot, a good fellow. We love you.

7
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,615
Finally here.

8
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,116
Yeah.

9
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,671
So?

10
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,389
- What do you think?
- It's gorgeous.

11
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,944
Decided to wake up
and see what home looks like, huh?

12
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,698
Come here.

13
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,543
Mommy! Daddy! I see a path.

14
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,968
Ellie, be careful.

15
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,262
Ellie!

16
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,181
Listen to your...

17
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,935
Mommy! Daddy!

18
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,520
It hurts!

19
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,065
Mommy! Daddy! It hurts!

20
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,650
- Are you OK?
- It hurts.

21
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,319
- Get rid of this.
- I got it, I got it.

22
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,486
Look out.

23
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,612
- You OK?
- It's all right.

24
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,740
No, it hurts.

25
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,909
Anyone who can scream that loud
isn't ready for intensive care just yet.

26
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,459
Cat.

27
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,965
She's just skinned her knee.

28
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,599
I don't want the stingy stuff, Daddy.

29
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,851
Where's Gage?

30
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,981
Gage!

31
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,571
No you don't, my friend.
Not in that road.

32
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,114
Gage!

33
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,699
I corralled him for you, missus.

34
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,327
Thank you. Thank you so much.

35
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,915
- Thank you. I'm Louis Creed.
- Jud Crandall.

36
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,170
I live just across the road.
You want to watch out for that road.

37
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,508
Them damn trucks go back and forth
all day and most of the night.

38
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,972
And who might you be, little miss?

39
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,557
I'm Ellen Creed.

40
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,977
And your dad's going to be
the new doctor at the college, I hear.

41
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,565
I think you're gonna be just as happy
as a clam here, Ellen Creed.

42
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,317
Are clams really happy?

43
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,074
Mr. Crandall, there's a path over there.
Do you know where it goes?

44
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,957
Yeah, that's a good story.
And a good walk.

45
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,419
I'll take you up there sometime.
Tell you the story, too.

46
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,963
After you get settled in.

47
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,089
Great.

48
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,384
Excuse me,
I've got to get this kid changed.

49
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,094
- It was nice to meet you.
- Same here.

50
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,680
Come on, Ellie. Give me your hand.

51
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,684
The house has stood empty too long.

52
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,978
It's damn good
to see people in it again.

53
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,617
Church!

54
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,036
You scared the life out of me, Church.

55
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,957
Come here.

56
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,599
- That you, Doc?
- Yeah, it's me.

57
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,434
Well, come on up and have a beer.

58
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,907
- Need a glass?
- Not at all.

59
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,283
Good for you.

60
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,247
Jesus.

61
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,418
Yeah. That's one mean road, all right.

62
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,881
You know that path
your wife commented on?

63
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:16,513
That road and those Orinco trucks
are the two main reasons it's there.

64
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,100
Well, where does it lead?

65
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,353
- Pet cemetery.
- Pet cemetery.

66
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:27,440
It's that damn road.
Uses up a lot of animals.

67
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,778
- Dogs and cats, mostly.
- My little girl's got a cat.

68
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,532
Winston Churchill.
We call him Church for short.

69
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,953
I'd get him fixed if I were you.

70
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,831
A fixed cat don't tend to wander.

71
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,333
If he's all the time
crossing back and forth on that road,

72
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,168
his luck will run out.

73
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,878
Well, I'll take it under advisement.

74
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,009
Meantime, Doc, here's to your bones.

75
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,469
And your bones.

76
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,359
I'll be going now, Dr. Creed.

77
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,278
All right, Missy. Thanks.

78
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,032
- Hi, Missy.
- Hi.

79
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,326
I'll do these up, bring them back
next time, Mrs. Creed.

80
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,203
Great. Can you come on Monday, Missy?

81
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,086
Always thought it would be lucky
to marry a doctor.

82
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,631
Wish I had a doctor around
with my stomach pain so bad.

83
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:37,385
Guess I'll never be lucky.
Hell, I ain't married to anyone.

84
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,849
Bye, Missy.

85
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,445
Mommy, Daddy, come on. Let's go!

86
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,113
We're coming!

87
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,160
All set? Let's get on with it.

88
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,085
There's the place.

89
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,920
What's it say, Mommy?

90
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,922
It says, "Pet sematary," honey.

91
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,508
It's misspelled,
but that's what it says.

92
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,345
Ellie, wait a minute!

93
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,642
I told you it was a bad road, Louis.

94
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,478
It's killed a lot of pets,
made a lot of kids unhappy.

95
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,984
At least something good come of it:
This place.

96
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,862
Couldn't plant nothing
but corpses here anyway, I guess.

97
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,365
How can you call it a good thing?

98
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,493
A graveyard for pets killed in the road,

99
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,662
built by brokenhearted children.

100
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,455
Well, they have to learn
about death somehow,

101
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,581
now, don't they, Mrs. Creed?

102
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,458
Why?

103
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,131
- Can I have the baby?
- Yeah.

104
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,058
Daddy, look, this one's a goldfishy.

105
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,645
That's right, Ellie.
They wasn't all killed by the road.

106
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,482
Especially the ones
from back in my time as a child.

107
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:21,281
They get older as you go
towards the middle. Harder to read.

108
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,367
Missy Ellen,
come over here just a minute.

109
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:31,583
That's where I buried my dog, Spot,
when he died of old age in 1924.

110
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,334
Ellie...

111
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,673
do you know
what a graveyard really is?

112
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,178
Well... I guess not.

113
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,181
It's a place where the dead speak.

114
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:51,019
No, not right out loud.

115
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,688
Their stones speak or their markers.

116
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,649
This ain't a scary place, Ellie.

117
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,736
It's a place of rest and speaking.

118
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,323
- Can you remember that?
- Yes, sir.

119
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,584
Hi, babe.

120
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:18,046
Daddy, what if Church dies?

121
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,341
What if he dies
and has to go to the pet sematary?

122
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,802
Honey, Church will be fine.

123
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,513
No, he won't. Not in the end.

124
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,390
In the end,
he's going to croak, isn't he?

125
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,100
Lovey...

126
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,563
Church might still be alive
when you're in high school,

127
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,440
and that's a very long time.

128
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:41,361
It doesn't seem long to me.
It seems short.

129
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,155
Well, if it was up to me,
I'd let Church live to be 100,

130
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,990
but I don't make up the rules.

131
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:50,078
And who does? God, I suppose.

132
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:56,084
He's not God's cat, he's my cat.
Let God get his own if he wants one.

133
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,587
Not mine. Not mine.

134
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,165
Yuck! Gross!

135
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,461
I'm scared.

136
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,589
What if school here
isn't like in Chicago?

137
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,966
I'm scared, and I want to go home.

138
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,801
You'll be all right, Ellie.

139
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,848
I don't want Church
to get his nuts cut, Daddy.

140
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,642
Good God, where did you hear that?

141
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,812
Missy Dandridge.
She says it's an operation.

142
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,525
The road is a lot more dangerous
than any operation.

143
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:07,572
Church will be just the same.
Well, almost the same.

144
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,076
And we won't have to worry about him
getting run over in the road by trucks.

145
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,411
Church'll be all right, honey.

146
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,079
You promise, Daddy?

147
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,585
Don't shilly-shally, Louis.
Give the little girl a promise.

148
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:26,174
Church will be fine. I promise.

149
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,601
Thank you.

150
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,603
You're very welcome.

151
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,563
But if anything does happen
while he's under the gas,

152
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:44,233
now, it's a one in 1,000 shot,
but it does happen,

153
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,944
you explain it to her.

154
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,697
Church!

155
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,125
Got to go.

156
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,731
- Going to get his...
- Nuts cut. Yes.

157
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,150
Thank you, Missy,
for introducing that colorful phrase

158
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,404
- into my daughter's vocabulary.
- Don't mention it.

159
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,283
How's that bellyache of yours?

160
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,786
No better. No worse.

161
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,208
You know,
I can take a look at that for you.

162
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,544
It'll pass. They always do.

163
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,178
- Missy.
- Ma'am.

164
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,103
Still friends, Doc?

165
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,574
I kissed you.

166
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,869
Have a great first day at school, Doc.

167
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,792
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

168
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,795
- Did anybody see what happened?
- He got hit by a truck.

169
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,423
- God!
- His head.

170
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,549
Hold him gently.

171
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,217
Didn't even stop!

172
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,470
- There's so much blood!
- What the hell's going on?

173
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,805
- Get the door.
- Get Dr. Creed!

174
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,307
What's happened here?

175
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,100
- He got hit by a truck.
- Oh, my God.

176
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,518
Dr. Creed!

177
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,604
Get them all out of here.

178
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,982
- Easy. Easy.
- All right. Everyone out, please.

179
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,692
Let the doctors do their work.

180
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,736
Come on, let's clear the room here.

181
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,696
Come on, everybody clear out!

182
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,739
Just clear out!

183
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,784
- Ambu bag. Start a cardiac monitor.
- Yes, sir.

184
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,327
Need large bores.

185
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,412
All right, get an ambulance here
and get it right now.

186
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,831
- He's got to go to EMC.
- It won't do any good.

187
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,335
I know it won't, but for God's sake,
let's do it by the rules. OK, now move!

188
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,380
- What's going on? Who is it?
- It's Pascow.

189
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,809
I told Rachel not so much
as a sprain today, my friend.

190
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,246
The soil...

191
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:49,043
of a man's heart...

192
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,881
is stonier...

193
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,051
Louis.

194
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,721
How did you know my name?

195
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,186
I'll come...

196
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,814
to you.

197
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,858
How did you know my name?

198
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:56,444
Come on, Doc. We've got places to go.

199
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,464
Come on, Doc.
Don't make me tell you twice.

200
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,152
Hey, why are you here?

201
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,865
I want to help you because...

202
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,492
Louis?

203
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,495
Because you tried to help me.

204
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,063
Let's go, Doc.

205
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,439
I don't like this dream.

206
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,693
Who said you were dreaming?

207
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:12,246
This is the place where the dead speak.

208
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,458
I want to wake up.
I want to wake up. That's all.

209
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,084
Don't go on, Doc.

210
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,630
No matter how much
you may feel you have to,

211
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,468
do not go on to the place

212
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:29,096
where the dead walk.

213
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,730
Please.

214
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:44,236
I just want to wake up. That's all.

215
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,866
The barrier was not meant to be crossed.

216
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,619
It's not my fault that you died.

217
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,163
You were as good as dead
when they brought you in.

218
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,583
The ground beyond...

219
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,505
is sour.

220
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,076
You up, Doc?

221
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,163
Getting there.

222
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,228
Thanks, nurse.

223
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,601
Louis, it's not right.

224
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,483
I don't like to think of you rattling
around the house on Thanksgiving Day.

225
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,694
That's supposed to be
a family holiday, Louis.

226
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:52,239
That's why you're going
with the kids and without me.

227
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,824
As far as your dad is concerned,

228
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,576
I'm never going to be
a member of the family.

229
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,703
But I want you around.

230
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,122
I'll be around plenty when you get back.

231
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,933
Hello.

232
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,019
Louis, afraid you may have
a spot of trouble here.

233
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,104
Jud? What trouble?

234
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,649
Well, there's a dead cat over here
on the edge of my lawn.

235
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,483
Oh, Jesus.

236
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,027
I think it might be your daughter's.

237
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,091
Yep. That's Church all right.

238
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,636
I'm sorry.

239
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,473
At least it don't look like he suffered.

240
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,768
Well, Ellie will suffer.
She'll suffer plenty.

241
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,145
Here. Give me that.

242
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,779
What are you going to do with it?

243
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:18,158
Put him in the garage, I guess.
I'll bury him in the morning.

244
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,498
You gonna tell Ellie?

245
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,668
Well, I'll have to mull that over
for a while.

246
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,086
Maybe when they call,
I'll just tell her

247
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,547
I haven't seen the damn cat around,
you know?

248
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,676
I don't want to spoil her holiday.
And Rachel's.

249
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,473
Maybe there's a better way.

250
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,942
So, do we plant him
on the outside of the circle

251
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,652
or do we start a new one?

252
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,195
The place we're going...

253
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,282
is on the other side of that.

254
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,871
We can't climb over that.
We'll break our necks.

255
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:08,000
No, we won't.
I've climbed it a time or two before.

256
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,085
I know all the places to step.

257
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,380
Just follow me.

258
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,216
Move easy.

259
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,723
Don't look down and don't stop.

260
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,770
If you stop,
you'll crash through for sure.

261
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,823
Just don't stop, and...

262
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,709
And don't look down. Right.

263
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,087
Louis, you all right?

264
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:58,008
Yeah. I guess I just lost
my happy thoughts there for a second.

265
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,354
Not much farther now.

266
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,614
Jud, what's that?

267
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,793
Just a loon. That's all.

268
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,174
Here we go.

269
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,969
Won't be much longer now.

270
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,152
Just down here a little ways.

271
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,336
Almost there, Louis.

272
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,172
You keep saying that.

273
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,882
This time, I mean it.

274
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,024
What is this place?

275
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,653
This was their burial ground.

276
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,116
Whose burial ground?

277
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,785
Micmac Indians.

278
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,372
I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.

279
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,917
Why, for God's sake?

280
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,588
I said why, Jud?

281
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,006
I had my reasons.

282
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,387
The soil's thin, but you'll manage.

283
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,558
I'm going to sit over yonder
and have a smoke.

284
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,895
I'd help you,
but you got to do it yourself.

285
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,855
Each buries his own.

286
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,629
Shit.

287
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,090
Louis?

288
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,968
- Louis?
- Yeah.

289
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,640
When you talk to them,

290
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,976
not one word
about what we done tonight.

291
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,729
What did we do tonight, Jud?

292
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:52,075
What we did, Louis, was a secret thing.

293
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,497
Women are supposed to be the ones
who are good at keeping secrets.

294
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:02,127
But any woman who knows
anything at all will tell you

295
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,838
she's never seen into a man's heart.

296
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,927
The soil of a man's heart,
Louis, is stonier...

297
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:15,182
like the soil up there
in the old Micmac burying ground.

298
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,544
Goldman residence.

299
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,880
Hi, Dory. It's Louis.

300
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,424
You want to talk to your daughter?

301
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,593
Yeah. That would be real fine.

302
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,179
Hi, Daddy.

303
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,722
Hi, baby.

304
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,225
How's everything in Chicago land?

305
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,019
Grandma and Grandpa
gave me all sorts of neat things.

306
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,147
How's Church, Daddy?
Does he miss me?

307
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,234
Well...

308
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,697
I guess he's just fine, Ellie.
I haven't seen him this evening, but...

309
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,574
Well, make sure you put him
down in the cellar before you go to bed

310
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,702
so he won't run out in the road.

311
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,080
And... and kiss him good night for me.

312
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,167
Yuck. Kiss your own cat.

313
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,007
Want to talk to Gage?

314
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:31,717
Yeah.

315
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,386
Here.

316
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:42,477
Hi, Daddy. I love you.

317
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,682
Jesus.

318
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,976
Church.

319
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,488
Food, Church.

320
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,660
Food.

321
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,833
Come on, Church. Chow down.

322
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,128
Come on, Church.

323
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,182
Christ. I don't believe this.

324
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,852
Oh, you stink, Church.

325
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,397
Hold on a second.

326
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,651
God, he chewed his way out.

327
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,115
Jesus, boy. Christ.

328
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,660
Damn it.

329
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,384
I'm trying to tell myself
that I buried him alive.

330
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,512
I'm not a vet.

331
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,722
It was dark.

332
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,182
Sure, it was dark.

333
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,478
But his head swiveled on his neck
like it was full of ball bearings.

334
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,898
When you moved him,
he pulled out of the frost, Louis.

335
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,777
Sounded like a piece
of Tickitape coming off a letter.

336
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,655
Live things don't do that.

337
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,950
You only stop melting
the frost under where you're laying

338
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,535
when you're dead.

339
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,455
Well, I feel like I'm going crazy.

340
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,299
It was the ragman
who told me about the place.

341
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,384
He was half Micmac himself.

342
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,679
He knew how I felt about my dog, Spot.

343
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,017
Spot had got caught
in barbed wire that infected.

344
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,103
When he died,
I thought I was gonna die.

345
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,066
The ragman did for me
what I did for you last night.

346
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,778
Only I wasn't alone
when Spot came back.

347
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,281
My mother was with me.

348
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,868
You could still see
the barbed wire marks on him.

349
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,081
Jud, come and get your dog!

350
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,959
He stinks of the ground
you buried him in!

351
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,502
Jud!

352
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,756
- Spot came back, all right.
- Spot!

353
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,342
He was never
quite the same dog that I knew.

354
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,510
Spot.

355
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,679
When he died peacefully in the night
that second time,

356
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,848
I buried him up there
in the pet sematary,

357
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,809
where, as you saw, his bones still lie.

358
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,146
A man doesn't always
know why he does things, Louis.

359
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,858
I think I did it
'cause your daughter ain't ready

360
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,027
for her favorite pet to die.

361
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,323
Maybe, with more time,
she'll learn what death really is,

362
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:27,786
which is where the pain stops
and the good memories begin.

363
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,330
Has anyone ever buried
a person up there?

364
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:36,211
Christ on his throne, no.
And who ever would?

365
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,992
Shit.

366
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,910
How the hell did you get in here?

367
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,765
Out!

368
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,220
Bye-bye, Ellie. Watch your step now.

369
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,680
There you go.

370
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,684
- Daddy!
- Hi, sugar.

371
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,144
Come here.

372
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,900
Hi, Daddy.

373
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,279
Daddy, is Church all right?

374
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,200
Yes. I guess so.

375
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,411
He was asleep on the porch when I left.

376
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,954
There you go.

377
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,374
Because I had a dream about him.

378
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,125
I dreamed he got hit by a car,

379
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:42,420
and you and Mr. Crandall
buried him in the pet sematary.

380
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,423
That was a silly dream, wasn't it?

381
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,634
Is he really all right?

382
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,803
Yes.

383
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,974
- Hi, honey.
- You want to take your son, Doc?

384
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,533
You smell bad.

385
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,666
Can cats have shampoos?

386
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,002
Yes, but you have to take them

387
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,170
to someone
who grooms animals, though,

388
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,673
and I think it's pretty expensive.

389
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:30,260
I don't care. I'll save up
my allowance and pay for it.

390
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,804
Church smells bad.

391
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,227
I'll cough up the money, Ellen.

392
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,688
I hate that smell.

393
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:45,150
Yes. I hate it, too.

394
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,862
- And a red balloon...
- This is the yellow one.

395
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:52,550
"And now, may the Lord bless you
and keep you."

396
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:55,762
May the Lord make his face
to shine upon you

397
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,265
and comfort you and lift you up

398
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,226
"and give you peace."

399
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:03,311
- Amen.
- Amen.

400
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,611
Rachel not feeling well?

401
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,488
Well, just a touch of the flu.

402
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,990
She's in bed. She's been throwing up

403
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,618
ever since Mrs. Rogers called
and said Mrs. Dandridge...

404
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,620
That's enough, Ellie.

405
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,332
Hop in.

406
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,000
Poor Missy.

407
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,629
I don't know why God'd take
someone like her

408
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,923
who should still have a bunch of years
left in front of her

409
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,801
and lets an old fart like me
just go on and on.

410
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,345
My father used to have a saying, Jud.

411
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,850
"God sees the truth, but waits."

412
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,311
Yeah.

413
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,771
How's your cat, Louis?

414
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,523
It's Ellie's cat.

415
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:52,151
No. It's your cat now.

416
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,744
Possibly more Atlantic
white-sided dolphins have beached

417
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,956
or stranded themselves
along the eastern Maine coast,

418
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,166
and scientists don't know why.

419
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,006
What's up, sugar?

420
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:16,384
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge
went to heaven?

421
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,179
Do you want to talk about it?

422
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,809
Is Missy in heaven, do you think?

423
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,312
I don't know, honey.

424
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,773
Different people believe
all sorts of different things.

425
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,401
Some believe in heaven or hell.

426
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,321
Some think we come back
as little children,

427
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,573
and some think we just wink out...

428
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,327
like a candle flame
when the wind blows hard.

429
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,746
Do you believe that?

430
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:51,878
No.

431
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,381
I think we go on.

432
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,930
Yeah. I have faith in that.

433
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,807
You believe in it.

434
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,893
Give me a kiss.

435
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,151
What do you want to watch?

436
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,876
I heard you and Ellie tonight.

437
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,046
I thought you might have.

438
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,215
I know you don't approve
of the subject.

439
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,550
I just get scared.

440
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,262
And you know me.

441
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:47,141
When I get scared, I get defensive.

442
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:50,103
Scared of what? Dying?

443
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,652
My sister, Zelda...

444
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,321
I know, she died. Spinal meningitis.

445
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,785
She was in the back bedroom
like a dirty secret.

446
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:12,417
My sister died in the back bedroom,

447
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,504
and that's what she was:
A dirty secret.

448
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:20,341
I had to... I had to feed her sometimes.

449
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,219
I hated it, but I did it.

450
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:30,059
We wanted her to die.
We wished for her to be dead.

451
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:34,480
It wasn't just so she wouldn't feel
any more pain.

452
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:37,275
It was so we wouldn't feel
any more pain.

453
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,778
It was because she started to look
like this monster.

454
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,364
Even now, I wake up and I think...

455
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,868
"Is Zelda dead yet?"

456
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,496
"Is she?"

457
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,752
My parents were gone when she died.

458
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,171
Rachel!

459
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,385
She started to...

460
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,556
She started to convulse,
and I thought...

461
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,517
I thought, "Oh my God, she's choking."

462
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,021
Zelda's choking!
And they'll come home,

463
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,940
and they'll say
I murdered her by choking.

464
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,527
They'll say, 'You hated her, Rachel, '
and that was true.

465
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,529
And they'll say,
'You wanted her to be dead, '

466
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,865
"and that was true, too."

467
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,911
And then she died.

468
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,208
And I started to scream.
I ran out of the house screaming,

469
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:39,545
"Zelda's dead! Zelda's dead!
Zelda's dead!"

470
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,049
And the neighbors,
they came out, and they looked.

471
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,511
They thought I was crying.

472
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,056
But you know something?

473
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,933
I think maybe...

474
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,311
I was laughing.

475
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,741
If you were, I salute you for it.

476
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,411
And if I ever needed another reason
not to like your mother and father,

477
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,163
I have one now.

478
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,542
You should never have been left alone
with her, Rachel.

479
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,628
Never. Where was her nurse?

480
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,423
They actually went out
and left an eight-year-old kid

481
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,509
in charge of her dying sister,

482
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,178
who was probably
clinically insane by then.

483
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,558
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get you a Valium.

484
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,393
But you know I don't take...

485
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,061
Tonight, you do.

486
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:06,632
Look!

487
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:07,884
He pulled.

488
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,468
Daddy's flying a kite.

489
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,554
- Mommy, look!
- Watch him!

490
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,599
- There it goes.
- That's it, Louis.

491
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,934
Go, Daddy.

492
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,270
Higher, higher. We want it higher.

493
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,147
Louis, let Gage do it.

494
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,315
Here you go, buddy.

495
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,297
You're flying it.

496
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,633
- There's the kite!
- You got it.

497
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,676
Gage is flying it. You got it.

498
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,553
Can I fly it now?

499
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,681
In a minute, honey.
Let Gage finish his turn.

500
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,351
- We gotted it.
- You got it.

501
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,647
- Look high goes.
- Now farther. Go ahead.

502
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,566
Go ahead. Run, buddy. Run.

503
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,736
Gage is flying it.

504
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,571
I'm flying it.

505
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,200
That kite's getting up there.

506
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,039
It got away from him, that numb shit.

507
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,750
Ellen Creed!

508
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,835
Oh, I dropped it.

509
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,590
Daddy, can I fly it now?

510
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,927
- OK, in just a minute.
- Louis, I want to fly it.

511
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:37,431
Daddy, Daddy, it's my turn now.

512
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,266
All right. Just a minute.

513
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,690
Don't let him go in the road, Louis!

514
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,192
Get him, Louis! Get the baby!

515
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:54,073
Get the baby!

516
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,702
Gage! Look out! Stop!

517
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:58,995
Stop!

518
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,955
Gage!

519
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,361
No!

520
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,390
Sedative finally took hold.

521
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,018
Rachel's asleep.

522
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,863
I want to go back to my own room.

523
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:20,409
I can't sleep with Mommy.
She keeps stealing the covers.

524
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,287
Ellie, what you got there?

525
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,999
What you got there? Let me see.

526
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,667
Can I see?

527
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:35,216
Ain't that real nice?
You pulling him in the wagon.

528
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,177
Bet he liked that, didn't he?

529
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,515
I'm going to carry this picture,
Mr. Crandall,

530
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,600
until God lets Gage come back.

531
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:48,687
Ellie, God doesn't do things like that.

532
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,689
He can if he wants to.

533
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:55,361
I have to keep his things
waiting for him.

534
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,571
That's what I think.

535
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:03,035
I've got his picture,
and I'm gonna sit in his chair...

536
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,370
Ellie.

537
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:17,258
Louis, take care of your little girl.

538
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,552
She needs you.

539
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,279
I knew something
like this would happen.

540
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,239
I told her when you were first married

541
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,617
you'll have all the grief
you can stand and more, I said.

542
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,578
Now, look at this.

543
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,580
I hope you rot in hell!

544
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,374
Where were you
when he was playing in the road?

545
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,917
You stinking shit!

546
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,253
You killer of children!

547
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,881
- Daddy!
- Ellie!

548
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,966
Stop it!

549
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,093
You son of a bitch!

550
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:06,473
No! Oh, God.

551
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,851
- No!
- No!

552
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,270
- No!
- Louis!

553
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,521
Son of a bitch!

554
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,523
You had no right!

555
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:16,775
What's wrong with you?

556
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:21,780
It's your son's funeral.
Get a hold of yourself, please.

557
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,903
Good night, Ellie.

558
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,407
Good night, Daddy.

559
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:11,163
Daddy?

560
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:19,546
God could take it back
if he wanted to, couldn't he?

561
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:23,509
If he really, really wanted to.

562
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,847
Can I have faith in that?

563
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,850
Yes.

564
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,395
I suppose you can.

565
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,690
Good night, Ellie.

566
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,425
Fuck off, hairball!

567
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,765
Jud, I buried my son today.

568
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:58,062
I'm very tired.
I wonder if we could just...

569
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:01,023
You're thinking thoughts
best not thought of, Louis.

570
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,694
I'm thinking about going to bed.

571
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,615
I'm responsible for more pain
in your heart

572
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,658
than you should have tonight.

573
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:17,122
For all I know, I may even be
responsible for the death of your son.

574
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,415
What?

575
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,422
Jud, you're talking crazy.

576
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,678
You are thinking
of putting him up there.

577
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:34,473
Don't deny the thought
hadn't crossed your mind, Louis.

578
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,396
Louis...

579
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,822
you asked me...

580
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:54,493
if anyone had ever buried a person
up there in the Micmac grounds.

581
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,455
I lied to you when I said no.

582
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,083
It's been done.

583
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,002
What you've been thinking of
has been done.

584
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,090
He was a local boy.

585
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,343
It was towards the end
of the Second World War.

586
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,596
His name was Timmy Baterman.

587
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:19,643
He was killed on his way home
from the Second World War.

588
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:22,020
His father, Bill Baterman,
was grief-struck.

589
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:25,524
He was so grief-struck,
he buried his son up there

590
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,986
before he ever had a chance
to get to the bottom of the truth.

591
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,198
I'll bite, Jud.

592
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,744
What's the bottom of the truth?

593
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:41,123
Well, sometimes dead is better.

594
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:46,462
The person you put up there
ain't the person that comes back.

595
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:51,216
It may look like that person,
but it ain't that person.

596
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:54,720
'Cause whatever lives in the ground

597
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:59,099
beyond the pet sematary
ain't human at all.

598
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:05,272
It was four or five days
after Timmy's funeral...

599
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,442
that Margie Washburn seen Timmy,

600
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,153
walking up the road
towards Yorkie's Livery.

601
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,323
As time went by,

602
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,409
lots of folks saw Timmy
walking back and forth.

603
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:23,165
But it was Margie who finally came
to some of us menfolks

604
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,250
and said it had to be stopped.

605
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,754
She knew it was an abomination.

606
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,176
So us men sat down and talked it out.

607
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,178
Then we got into my car

608
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,555
and went over to the Baterman place
to take care of it.

609
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,057
He's dead! He ain't natural!

610
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,266
One way or the other.

611
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,102
Yeah, there's no other way.
He's got to burn!

612
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,647
You're wrecking my house! Stop it!

613
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:49,525
- Timmy, stop it!
- Daddy.

614
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,151
The place is going up!

615
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,778
Go away!

616
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,821
Get out while you still can, Bill.

617
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,949
- Bring out the cans.
- I got them.

618
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:00,327
Wait a minute, fellows. Wait a minute.
He's a monster, Bill.

619
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:05,165
Leave us alone! He's my son!

620
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,293
- Come, Timmy. Let's get out.
- Love Dad!

621
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,546
Hate living!

622
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,506
Come on, son!

623
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:15,259
No, Timmy! No!

624
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,303
Love Dad! Hate living.

625
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:21,932
Louis, sometimes dead is better.

626
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,101
The Indians knew that.

627
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:28,355
They stopped using that burial ground
when the ground went sour.

628
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,316
Don't think about doing it, Louis.

629
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:35,988
The place gets a hold of you,
but the place is evil.

630
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,909
Sometimes dead is better.

631
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,289
You see, Louis,
what I'm getting at here?

632
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:46,456
You understand?

633
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,877
You're telling me that place knew
Gage was going to die?

634
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,089
I'm saying...

635
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,093
that place might have made Gage die

636
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,596
because I introduced you to the power.

637
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,349
I may have murdered your son, Louis.

638
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:17,362
This could be the beginning
of patching things up with your folks.

639
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:21,992
If something good doesn't come
from Gage's death, I think...

640
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,707
I don't want to go to Chicago,
Grandma Dory.

641
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,000
Why not, darling?

642
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,336
I had a bad dream last night.

643
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,338
About what?

644
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:37,883
About Daddy and Gage...

645
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,386
and someone named Paxcow.

646
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:44,431
You guys better get going,
or you're gonna miss the boat.

647
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:48,560
Louis, I am sorry.

648
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,605
What can I say? I lost my mind.

649
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,024
We all lost our minds, Irwin.

650
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,706
You take care of your mother, darling.

651
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:12,042
Come with us, Daddy.
Please come with us.

652
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,628
I'll be there in three days,
four at the most.

653
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,713
Please, Daddy, I'm scared.

654
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:20,175
Everything's going
to be all right, Ellie.

655
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,052
Do you swear?

656
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,264
I swear.

657
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,605
Come on, Ellie. Let's go.

658
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:27,993
It's wrong.

659
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,288
What happened to you is wrong.

660
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,207
Remember, Doc...

661
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:39,421
the barrier was not meant
to be crossed.

662
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,383
The ground is sour.

663
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,354
If it doesn't work...

664
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,650
if he comes back...

665
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,198
and he's like Jud said
Timmy Baterman was...

666
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:10,410
I'll just put him back to sleep.

667
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,123
They don't have to know.

668
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,419
Rachel and Ellie
don't ever have to know.

669
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:29,471
Mommy. Mommy.

670
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,391
Mommy! Mommy.

671
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:36,561
Mommy! Mommy!

672
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:40,273
Honey, you just had a bad dream,
that's all. You know that, don't you?

673
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:44,402
It wasn't a dream. It was Paxcow.

674
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:48,323
Paxcow says Daddy's
gonna do something really bad.

675
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,576
Who is this Paxcow?
Is he like the bogeyman?

676
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:54,871
He's a ghost. He's a good ghost.

677
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,499
He says he was sent to warn us.

678
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,919
He says he was near Daddy
because they were together

679
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,755
when his soul was dis...

680
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,591
Dis...

681
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:10,887
I can't remember.

682
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:12,013
Listen to me.

683
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:15,058
There are no ghosts, Ellie.
There are no ghosts.

684
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:18,436
Now, I want you to go to sleep
and forget all this nonsense.

685
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:20,355
Do you hear me?

686
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:25,318
Will you at least call
and make sure Daddy's OK?

687
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:27,195
Of course, I will.

688
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:54,180
Paxcow? Where do I know that name?

689
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,057
Pascow.

690
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,726
Pascow?

691
01:04:58,644 --> 01:04:59,978
Was she saying Pascow?

692
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:04,232
He was trying to help me
because Daddy was helping him

693
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,359
when his soul dis, dis...

694
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:08,653
Discorporate.

695
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:19,873
I'm going to bust you out, son.

696
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,694
He's not home.

697
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:54,991
Probably went out for a hamburger
or a chicken dinner, dear.

698
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:57,827
You know how men are
when they're alone.

699
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,548
- Hello?
- Hello, Jud. It's Rachel Creed.

700
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:12,634
I'm calling from Chicago.

701
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:15,428
Chicago? Is Louis with you?

702
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:18,723
No. We're going to be here a while,

703
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:21,685
and he needed a few days
to close things up back there.

704
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,229
I just wondered if he was with you.

705
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,439
No.

706
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:31,319
But if he drops by,
I'll tell him to call you.

707
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,071
Don't bother, Jud. I'm coming home.

708
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,281
Rachel, no.
You don't want to do that.

709
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:37,242
I have to do it, Jud. Goodbye.

710
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,037
Rachel! Rachel!

711
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:12,003
You've done it, you stupid old man.
Now you got to undo it.

712
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:36,694
Oh, Gage.

713
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,162
It's going to be all right.

714
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:50,333
I swear it's going to be all right.

715
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:55,607
I'm coming for you, Rachel.

716
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,235
And this time...

717
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,240
I'll get you.

718
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:10,455
Gage and I...

719
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,833
will get you...

720
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,961
for letting us die!

721
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,594
Good evening again,
ladies and gentlemen.

722
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,304
We've had a strong tailwind,

723
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:31,017
and we expect to arrive at
Boston's Logan Airport almost on time.

724
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,644
Thank God.

725
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,402
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

726
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:49,994
Excuse me.

727
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:55,708
Excuse me. Excuse me.

728
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:58,836
Excuse me. Excuse me!

729
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,094
Don't do that, babe.

730
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,846
- Make it wait.
- I can't.

731
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:12,183
All right, I'll call the pilot.

732
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,988
I'm not going to stop, Gage.

733
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,825
I'm not going to look down.

734
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:47,779
I'm sorry. It's been very busy.
I really don't have anything.

735
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:51,282
What about the Aries K,
the one with the scratch on its side?

736
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:56,120
I do have an Aries K,
but it came in rather beat-up,

737
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,081
and there's a long scrape up one side.

738
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,665
I'll take it.

739
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:03,711
OK, major credit card and a license.

740
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,444
Louis.

741
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,544
See?

742
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,380
Just imagination.

743
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:40,183
Now what?

744
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,435
It's trying to stop you.

745
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:45,646
Do you hear me? It's trying to stop you.

746
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,533
Is anyone there?

747
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:18,763
Come back to me, Gage.

748
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:24,727
Come back to us.

749
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:24,745
Hey!

750
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:27,039
Hey, stop!

751
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:39,343
Hop in, babe.

752
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,262
Thank you!

753
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:18,901
Oh, my.

754
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:54,520
Who's here?

755
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:03,612
Let's play hide and go seek.

756
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:24,842
Gage?

757
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:31,807
You the one playing games?

758
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:03,756
Gage?

759
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,052
Come on out.

760
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,598
I brought you something.

761
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:52,096
Where did you...

762
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:56,660
Thank you so much.

763
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:58,579
Think nothing of it.

764
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:02,708
Hell, I didn't get a ticket, lady,
so you're welcome.

765
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:05,377
Whatever your problems are,
I hope they work out.

766
01:22:05,545 --> 01:22:09,256
It's the end of the line for me, too.
I'm not allowed any further.

767
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:11,592
I'm sure things will be fine.

768
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,093
I'm not.

769
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,522
Rachel!

770
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:56,303
Church?

771
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:05,328
Jud?

772
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:51,984
Jud, are you up there?

773
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:19,903
Rachel.

774
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:37,571
Rachel, is that you?

775
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,116
I finally came back for you, Rachel.

776
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,703
I'm going to twist your back like mine

777
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:47,706
so you'll never get out of bed again.

778
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:51,835
Never get out of bed again.

779
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:58,383
Never get out of bed again!

780
01:25:11,022 --> 01:25:12,815
Oh, Gage.

781
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,321
I brought you something, Mommy.

782
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:21,406
Gage.

783
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:25,327
I brought you something, Mommy.

784
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:34,336
Gage. Gage.

785
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:37,673
I brought you something, Mommy.

786
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:50,978
Oh, Christ.

787
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:03,031
Gage.

788
01:26:23,636 --> 01:26:25,095
Oh, my God.

789
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:30,767
Gage?

790
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:58,295
Hello.

791
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:00,964
Hello, Louis. It's Irwin.

792
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:04,176
I just wanted to be sure
Rachel got back all right.

793
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:09,264
Louis? Are you there?

794
01:27:09,849 --> 01:27:11,642
Yes, I'm here.

795
01:27:11,809 --> 01:27:13,101
Did she get back all right?

796
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,562
Yes. She's fine.

797
01:27:16,105 --> 01:27:19,942
Well, put her on at that end,
and I'll put Ellie on this one.

798
01:27:20,318 --> 01:27:22,611
Ellie's very worried about her mother.

799
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,696
She's almost in hysterics.

800
01:27:24,864 --> 01:27:25,781
She's...

801
01:27:27,867 --> 01:27:29,201
Rachel's asleep.

802
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:31,328
Then, I suggest you wake her up.

803
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:34,748
Ellie had a dream
that her mother was dead.

804
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,334
Irwin, I can't talk to you right now.

805
01:27:55,895 --> 01:27:58,313
Irwin, I told you
I can't talk to you right now.

806
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:01,984
I'm at Jud's, Daddy.
Will you come over and play with me?

807
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:06,071
First, I played with Jud.

808
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:09,366
Then Mommy came,
and I played with Mommy.

809
01:28:09,867 --> 01:28:13,620
We played, Daddy.
We had a awful good time.

810
01:28:14,205 --> 01:28:16,707
Now I want to play with you.

811
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:24,548
What did you do?

812
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:39,688
Hi, Church.

813
01:28:40,773 --> 01:28:43,400
Want some grub, Church? Church.

814
01:28:56,622 --> 01:28:58,415
Don't mind me.

815
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:03,086
Eat it while you can.

816
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:07,507
That's right.

817
01:29:09,093 --> 01:29:13,096
Today is Thanksgiving Day for cats.

818
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,100
But only...

819
01:29:18,644 --> 01:29:20,645
if they came back from the dead.

820
01:29:44,128 --> 01:29:47,547
Go on. Lie down.

821
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,259
Play dead.

822
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:55,472
Be dead!

823
01:30:27,713 --> 01:30:29,313
Gage?

824
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:57,576
Gage, what have you done?

825
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:07,878
Rachel!

826
01:31:16,512 --> 01:31:18,388
Scared you, didn't I?

827
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:21,433
- Gage?
- Hi, Daddy.

828
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:24,311
Now I want to play with you.

829
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,404
All right, Gage.

830
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:39,618
Let's play.

831
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:22,405
Daddy.

832
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:30,788
Come here.

833
01:35:04,615 --> 01:35:06,533
No fair.

834
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:08,785
No fair, no fair.

835
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:36,498
I'm sorry, Louis.

836
01:36:37,082 --> 01:36:38,500
I'm so sorry.

837
01:36:39,251 --> 01:36:42,796
But don't make it worse. Don't!

838
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:45,215
I waited too long with Gage.

839
01:36:45,382 --> 01:36:50,762
With Rachel, it will work this time
because she just died.

840
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:53,306
She just died a little while ago.

841
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:59,479
Louis, don't!

842
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:02,899
Please, Louis!

843
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:05,401
No!

844
01:37:10,533 --> 01:37:12,742
It will be all right, Rachel.

845
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:15,495
I promise.

846
01:37:44,149 --> 01:37:47,735
The soil of a man's heart
is stonier, Louis.

847
01:37:48,904 --> 01:37:52,323
A man grows what he can.
Then he tends it.

848
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:57,120
Because what you buy is what you own.

849
01:37:58,622 --> 01:38:03,751
And what you own
always comes home to you.

850
01:39:14,865 --> 01:39:16,866
Darling.

851
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:35,426
No!
