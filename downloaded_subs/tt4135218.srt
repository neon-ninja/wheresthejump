1
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,670
What are you doing?

2
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,470
Is your Spotify working?

3
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,710
Yeah. Why?

4
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,630
I dunno, mine's being retarded.

5
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,550
Alex Freeman probably hacked you.

6
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,600
He did mine and changed every
single playlist to Jason Derulo.

7
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,430
I still haven't forgiven Alex

8
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,070
for changing all my contacts
to Harry Potter characters.

9
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,630
~ What a twat!
~ He put himself as Voldemort.

10
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,790
Oh, please! More like
Neville Longbottom.

11
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,230
My mum was Bellatrix Lestrange.

12
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,870
At least he got that right.

13
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,990
Here, what do we think
of this bronzer?

14
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,230
You look like a Wotsit.

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,510
See, this is why I need you.

16
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,350
My mum is now on
Snapchat, by the way.

17
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,430
Urgh! Why?!

18
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,310
I'd like to say she's just
trying to reconnect,

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,750
but I actually think she likes it.

20
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,230
What are you doing?

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,430
Checking flights to Barca.

22
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,230
Casey! We're going to Outlook!
Why are you fighting this?

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,230
Sonar! Barcelona has culture.

24
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,750
Er, Pula has a beach!

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,430
Barcelona has a beach,

26
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,670
and plus, if we don't get any more
money, we're not going anywhere.

27
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,910
Casey?

28
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,070
What?

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,270
Nathan.

30
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,670
Please don't use the N-word.

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,950
You should look.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,990
At what?

33
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,430
His tweet.

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,310
I unfollowed him. What does it say?

35
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,670
It's not very nice.

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,310
Can you just read it?

37
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,360
"I guess it's no surprise that Casey
Jacobs is on antidepressants.

38
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,880
"I spent one night with
her and it depressed me."

39
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,760
How could he write that?

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,630
Are you OK?

41
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,470
How does he know? I
haven't told anyone.

42
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,870
Tamara?

43
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,390
You're the only one I've told.

44
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,440
He was in your room,
did he see your pills?

45
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,950
Casey, I didn't tell anyone.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah, I know.

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,310
Oh, my God, no!

48
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,990
We are doing this!

49
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,830
~ What?
~ You know who!

50
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,630
Oh, no, Megan, just leave it.

51
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,070
What? No way! He owes us.

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,110
~ Hey, Alex.
~ Hey. What do you guys want?

53
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,390
Thanks for hacking my friend's
Spotify account.

54
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,390
You think I have nothing better to
do than hack your Spotify accounts?

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,110
We KNOW you have nothing
better to do.

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,790
Put the porn away. We need your help.

57
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,950
I'm not looking at porn!

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Have you seen what that dickwad
Nathan Legg has just tweeted?

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,550
Oh, peak!

60
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,910
Don't say "peak", Alex

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,350
I didn't even know you and
Nathan broke up. Sorry, Casey.

62
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,950
Yeah, don't be, he's a fucktard.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,630
So, what do you want me to do?

64
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,550
~ Hack that motherfucker.
~ Megan...

65
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,350
~ What? Come on, let's do him!
~ Just wait.

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,830
Er, I'm not hacking Nathan Legg.

67
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,150
~ Why not?
~ Guess what? He's not going
to kick the shit out of you.

68
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,710
~ How would he know it was you?
~ Yeah, how WOULD he know, genius?

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,030
As soon as anyone in school
gets hacked, they blame me!

70
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,390
You should have thought of that

71
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,230
before you hacked
everyone, Voldemort!

72
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,830
All right, fuck you, Megan!
I've hacked, like, two people.

73
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,880
All right, get back to
your porno, then, Useless!

74
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,150
Oh, shit. Jack's here.

75
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,630
Wait, you're going out?

76
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,870
Text me, OK?

77
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,670
OK, but won't Jack mind?

78
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,350
I love you, bitch.

79
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
I love you, ho.

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Case?

81
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,350
Case?

82
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,710
Yeah?

83
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,990
What's wrong?

84
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,990
Nothing!

85
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,550
What do you want for dinner?

86
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,190
(For fuck's sake...)

87
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,240
I'm not hungry!

88
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,110
When will you be hungry?!

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,160
I DON'T KNOW, OK? CAN YOU
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?!

90
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,920
Jesus!

91
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,560
We both call each other
bitch, you idiot!

92
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,600
(Nathan's profile?)

93
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Erectile dysfunction makes me bitter.

94
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,910
So bitter,

95
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,960
I vent my limp-dicked anger on women.

96
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,520
Please pray for me
and my pathetic penis.

97
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,350
Nathan.

98
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Kiss.

99
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,750
Shit!

100
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Who the fuck...?

101
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,880
No, we don't!

102
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,870
'Hi, it's Megan. Leave me a message
and I MIGHT get back to you.'

103
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,430
Hey, bitch. Sorry, I
know you're with Jack.

104
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,790
Er, can you give me a call?

105
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,470
I think someone's online as Alex.

106
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,710
Yeah, just call me back.

107
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Fuck off!

108
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Of course.

109
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Whatever!

110
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,440
A fan of what, you freak?

111
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,110
How the fuck...?

112
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,550
I can't stop shopping.
I don't know what it is,

113
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,750
I see it and I literally
am in love with it.

114
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,870
Sometimes I feel like there
are just the odd item

115
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,830
that you can't live without.

116
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,880
I'm a big blazer, kind
of kimono fan...

117
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,990
And you can open and close
them by turning the top.

118
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,550
And you can open and close
them by turning the top.

119
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,990
'This is the perfect neon
I've been looking for.

120
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,030
'I never know what to pick!

121
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,430
'This is the perfect neon
I've been looking for.

122
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,750
'I never know what to pick!'

123
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,550
This is muchos, muchos affordable.
Muchos, muchos affordable

124
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,390
Barg, barg...

125
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Hypocrite.

126
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,200
Without anyone judging us.

127
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,400
No fucking way!

128
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,630
'Hi, it's Megan. Leave me a message
and I MIGHT get back to you.'

129
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,350
Hey, bitch. I'm sorry
I missed your call.

130
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,310
You need to check your Instagram,
some fucker's into Alex's stuff

131
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,360
and mine and now yours. Just call me.

132
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,980
(Fuck, fuck, fuck...)

133
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Casey?

134
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,990
Case?

135
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,870
Yeah?

136
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,790
I'm taking Simon to football.

137
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,840
You all right?

138
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,280
I'm fine!

139
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,480
Are we alone now, Casey?

140
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,630
I know. It's awful...

141
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,550
I sound like a constipated
Stephen Hawking.

142
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,710
What the fuck?

143
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,760
And yes, I can totally hear you too.

144
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Now, sit down, Casey.

145
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,830
What did you do with that photo?

146
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,350
Nothing yet.

147
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,310
Why did you take them, Casey?

148
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,710
Nathan practically begged me to!

149
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,760
And it was just that one.

150
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,430
Now, now, Casey.

151
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Pants on fire, I counted
five, at least.

152
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,870
Nathan, if this is you...

153
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,190
I'll tell everyone what you told
me your mum did on holiday

154
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,470
in Weston-super-Mare!

155
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,520
I could've put that in
the tweet, but I didn't!

156
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,240
What did Nathan's mother do on
holiday in Weston-super-Mare?

157
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Please, Casey. Do you really
think Nathan Legg could do this?

158
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,910
~ What are you doing?
~ Flexing my muscles.

159
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,310
No wait, show me again, show me
again, do it again, do it again.

160
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,030
No, no, its more like...

161
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,670
~ Stop checking me out.
~ She needs to just hurry up and come out.

162
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,670
Seriously, it's getting embarrassing.

163
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,990
It's like a dog on heat.

164
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,950
~ She'll wait till she's at
Uni, then she'll go full dyke.
~ God!

165
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yeah, then we'll be like, "Tamara,
no shit you're gay?" Who knew?

166
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,990
All those times you came over,
just as we happened to be getting

167
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,040
changed, and stared at us half
naked, for like, ever...

168
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,150
We had no idea!

169
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,390
~ Next time she stares at me
I'm going to say something.
~ Well, like what?

170
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Like, Tamara, you're a total
fucking lesbian, deal with it.

171
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,470
What are you doing?

172
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,230
This is Tamara, right?

173
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,750
~ Wait.
~ You said she needs to come out.

174
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,350
Wait, what are you doing?

175
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,400
No, no, no! Please, don't. Stop!

176
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,630
No wait, show me again, show me
again, do it again, do it again.

177
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,830
No, no, no, it's more like...

178
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,510
~ What have you done?
~ Stop checking me out.

179
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,190
That was nothing.

180
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,190
Seriously, It's getting embarrassing.

181
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Now imagine if I did that
with your special selfies?

182
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,560
You know what happens to girls
when those photos get out there?

183
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,990
If you try to shut down...

184
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,030
If you try to switch
off the router...

185
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,080
If you leave the room,
the pictures go online.

186
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,840
What do you want?

187
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,150
Patience, Casey.

188
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,200
First of all, I want you to sit.

189
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,880
Look! Twitter-storm alert.

190
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Oh, God!

191
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,950
Don't be too sad, Casey.

192
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You upset ME first!

193
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,790
You lied to me, Casey.

194
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,150
About the door.

195
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,830
It wasn't closed, was it?

196
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,830
You promised.

197
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,880
And you weren't going to eat a
chicken dinner either, were you?

198
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,840
No more lies, Casey.

199
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Only truth.

200
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,760
Say, you promise.

201
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,750
Fine.

202
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,430
Say, you promise.

203
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,480
I promise.

204
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,070
Tell me what you're thinking, Casey.

205
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,310
Hi, its Megan, leave me a message
and I might get back to you.

206
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,110
Tell me what you're thinking, Casey.

207
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,310
I'm thinking about what
my friends will do

208
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,360
when they find out that
my webcam has been hacked

209
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,640
and that it wasn't me that posted
that video about Tamara.

210
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,510
I'm thinking about how
they'll track you down,

211
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,560
find you and fuck you up!

212
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,150
Knock, knock.

213
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,670
~ Knock, knock.
~ Who's there?

214
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,720
You'll never, ever know.

215
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,520
I know you're over 30.

216
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,230
It's the way you speak.

217
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,510
With the BFFs and the lols?

218
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,560
You sound like a parent.

219
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Get that right, did I?

220
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,750
How old are you?

221
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,800
Just tell me one thing
about yourself.

222
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,070
What colour is your hair?

223
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,870
Or are you bald?

224
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,920
That's it, isn't it? I am sorry.
I've heard it can be a really

225
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,160
traumatic time for a middle
aged man losing all his hair.

226
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,910
What makes you think I'm a man?

227
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,030
It's not fair!

228
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,080
You know everything about me
and I know nothing about you.

229
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,120
Pick it up.

230
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Go ahead. Get the phone.

231
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,110
Hey, Casey, does this sound familiar?

232
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,070
Hi, its Megan, leave me a message
and I might get back to you.

233
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,550
I'm thinking about what
my friends will do

234
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,110
when they find out my
webcam has been hacked.

235
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,230
I'm thinking about how
they'll track you down,

236
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,670
find you and fuck you up!

237
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,720
Casey, if I can take
over your computer,

238
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,950
do you really think I'd let you have

239
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,630
a smartphone to play with?

240
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,870
Why are you doing this?!

241
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,920
I told you, I help victims
of cyber bullying.

242
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,350
Really?

243
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,630
Oh, yes.

244
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,680
How the hell is this helping me?

245
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Ouch, that hurts! Soooo funny.

246
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,400
What's so fucking funny?

247
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You're not the victim, Casey.

248
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,920
You're the Cyber Bully!

249
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,910
How am I a cyberbully?

250
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,270
Wow, let me see.

251
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,270
So many examples.

252
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,070
'I can't stop shopping.'

253
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,230
'Sometimes I feel like there are
items that you can't live without.'

254
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,070
What? You think THAT
is cyber bullying?

255
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,030
'I don't know what it is, I see it
and I literally am in love with it.'

256
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,670
You're ridiculing people
on the internet.

257
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,070
What would you call it?

258
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,120
These are the sort of girls that
bully ugly and fat kids at school!

259
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,230
And that makes it OK
to bully them online?

260
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,750
It's not bullying!

261
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,950
It's...

262
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,270
It's sarcastic!

263
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,870
What about Mr Soft?

264
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,630
What Nathan? What about him?

265
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,990
Erectile dysfunction?

266
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,040
Can you imagine how much shit
he's going to get for that?

267
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,080
It wasn't him, was it?

268
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,550
You that sent that tweet.

269
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,600
You didn't even stop to question it.

270
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,510
What do you want from me?

271
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,350
Three things...

272
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,400
First, I want you to admit
what you really are.

273
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,110
What.. a bully?

274
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Then I want you to realise
who you have hurt.

275
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,990
Nathan?

276
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,040
And some idiot shoppers?

277
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,630
What, her?

278
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,150
You took her down.

279
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,910
Jennifer Li? No, I didn't.

280
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,910
Oh, God, she is just beyond awful.

281
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,990
~ ♪ Keep burning, keep... ♪
~ How did you know her?

282
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,910
I told you, she was in the
year above me at school.

283
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,870
You really found her funny, huh?

284
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,600
Chronic Youth, that's
you, right, Casey?

285
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,790
"When singers are too
deluded for X Factor."

286
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,270
Steerpike underscore 84...

287
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,270
"Har har - too shit for X Factor."

288
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,790
Alise underscore Dr1...

289
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,790
"Wat a talentless whore."

290
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,630
Mike2Rite...

291
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,230
"Go drink a bleach cocktail."

292
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,950
Urpaltommy...

293
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,830
"I fucked her and she
gave me chlamydia."

294
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,150
Mike2Rite...

295
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,710
"Just the kind of plastic bitch
who should be destroyed."

296
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,030
I didn't write all this!

297
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,230
But you started it, Casey.

298
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,030
You threw in the grenade and ran.

299
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,670
I just shared what
was already out there.

300
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,950
That's not all you did.

301
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Is it... Moe?

302
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,230
Oh, Come on! Moe Lester?

303
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,710
~ How did she not see..?
~ Read it.

304
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,390
Aloud.

305
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,710
"Jen. My name is Moe Lester.

306
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,150
"I am CEO of Columbia Records.

307
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,990
"Would you be interested
in signing with us?

308
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,990
"Columbia!"

309
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,670
"Hi, Moe. Yes, thanks
for your message.

310
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,230
"I would be super stoked
to sing along with you guys,

311
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,750
"it would be awesome."

312
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,070
Hi Moe.

313
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,120
Yes, I would be super stoked
to sing with you guys.

314
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,110
"Super Stoked," who says that?

315
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,160
'We are putting together
a new girl band.'

316
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,120
Like you never pretended
to be someone you're not.

317
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,230
I do it to help victims
of cyber bullying.

318
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,710
Everyone does it!

319
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,710
Nathan and Stuart Gorton pretended
to be a Russian lap dancer,

320
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,470
flirting with Kyle Harris for weeks!

321
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,430
Kyle was going to meet her in a hotel.
He thought they were in love.

322
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,430
The whole school knew about it!

323
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,110
And you think that's OK?

324
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,870
See, this is how I know you're old,

325
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,590
you don't get it!

326
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,030
Of course I don't think it's
OK, it's fucking nasty.

327
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:25,070
But it's normal, it happens
and we deal with it.

328
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,750
Like Jennifer did?

329
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,830
Why, what did she do?

330
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,470
You don't know?

331
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,150
No, she moved away

332
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,870
Hi, guys.

333
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,950
This is just a video to say,
I'm sorry the new website

334
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,070
isn't up and running yet.

335
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,870
I know most of you have been following
me for the right reasons,

336
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,270
and I thank you for
your love and support.

337
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,320
Unfortunately, there are some haters
who follow me wherever I go,

338
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,510
who have forced me to change domain
names and make a new website.

339
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,150
I would just like to say that
if you are one of the people

340
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,750
sending pictures of
dead animals to me

341
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,310
there's something wrong with
you and you need help.

342
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,150
For those of you who are looking
forward to my next recording,

343
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,200
I can reveal that I'm working
on some new songs of my own,

344
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,440
and they will be about Autumn because
that's my favourite season.

345
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,230
Oh, apart from Spring.

346
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,280
It's important the haters realise
that expressing creativity

347
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,710
is a fundamental human right...

348
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,790
Why is she doing this to herself?

349
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,710
.. and you shoot me down,
but I won't fall. No hate.

350
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,030
Peace out.

351
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,080
Rule number one, don't
feed the trolls!

352
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,160
And let me guess, they
trolled this video too?

353
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,920
Hello?

354
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,280
Oh, shit!

355
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,760
(Jennifer...)

356
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,630
Jennifer?

357
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,390
I'm sorry.

358
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,670
I'm so sorry I hurt you.

359
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,190
I should have just kept
my stupid mouth shut.

360
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,240
I had no right to judge you.

361
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,680
The truth is...

362
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,760
.. I've always been kind
of jealous of you.

363
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,040
At school you looked so...

364
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,030
.. comfortable...

365
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,750
with yourself.

366
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,800
And then online you
put yourself out there

367
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,990
for everyone to see.

368
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,510
And that's so cool.

369
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,560
I could never do something like that.

370
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,240
I use fake names.

371
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,430
Which makes me a bit of a coward,

372
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,480
I guess...

373
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,150
Touching, Casey.

374
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,870
Almost truthful, even.

375
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,920
But I'm not Jennifer.

376
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,270
What is that?

377
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,320
Girls at Jennifer's new school
dressed up as her for Halloween.

378
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,520
The pictures were sent
to her family members.

379
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,710
These arseholes that did this...

380
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,670
That's fucked up!

381
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,550
But why are you picking on me?

382
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,600
Because you were the first
to troll Jennifer's video.

383
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,990
It started with you.

384
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,230
It would have happened anyway.

385
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,910
Someone else would have done it.

386
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,310
You can't know that.

387
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,190
Yes, I can!

388
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,670
Because if there's
one thing we all know

389
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,830
it's that everything
gets slated online.

390
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,880
Jennifer Li knew that when
she posted her videos.

391
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,990
Didn't you, Jennifer?

392
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,590
I'm not Jennifer.

393
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,990
Yes, you are.

394
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,870
You're Jennifer Li.

395
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,350
Blaming me for all this just
because I was the first person

396
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,430
who posted that video is
just the kind of corny,

397
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,910
sentimental bullshit Jennifer
Li would come up with.

398
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,960
It fits perfectly with that,
"look at me" victim identity.

399
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You know why you get
bullied, Jennifer?

400
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,680
It's because you ask for it.

401
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,190
Wow!

402
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,910
Well done, Casey.

403
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,070
Now you're talking
like your true self.

404
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,310
A bully.

405
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Well, then, I guess we're all
bullies, aren't we, Jennifer?

406
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,750
I am not Jennifer Li.

407
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,160
What is that?

408
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,270
She didn't.

409
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,630
Jennifer thought that
if she posted this

410
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,510
the troll's would leave her alone.

411
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,390
She was wrong.

412
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,470
Steerpike underscore 84...

413
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,230
"Lame effort."

414
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,710
99Badman99...

415
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,710
"Attention whoring bitch."

416
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,110
I can read it for myself.

417
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,990
Blaze underscore 7
underscore Blaze...

418
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,150
"Try the other side of the
arm, you'll bleed more."

419
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,710
You don't need to read it out loud.

420
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,630
Would you like to see her last video?

421
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,350
No.

422
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,270
Oh, I've seen these.

423
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,950
They tell their sad story...

424
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,710
Why do they take so long over it?

425
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,590
My parents are divorced,

426
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,590
I didn't subject the world
to my singing voice.

427
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,040
I didn't know that.

428
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,230
I didn't know any of this.

429
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,350
I get it.

430
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,070
It's fucking terrible.

431
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,630
~ I don't need to watch any more.
~ Yes, you do, Casey.

432
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,110
This fucking music...

433
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,190
Look at the screen, Casey.

434
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,350
The abuse went on and on.

435
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,400
It only stopped two weeks ago.

436
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,880
What happened two weeks ago?

437
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,830
Shut the fuck up.

438
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,880
Go on.

439
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,310
I would've heard about it.

440
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,190
Jennifer did not make
the front pages.

441
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,550
Cybersuicides aren't
what they used to be.

442
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,870
You...

443
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,430
You're lying.

444
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,480
I'm surprised you didn't
troll her memorial page.

445
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,990
'Sup, Casey?

446
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,910
Regrets?

447
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,510
B-Bu...

448
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,710
But she-she was unstable -

449
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,760
with her mum and who knows what
else was going on at home?

450
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,190
You were Jennifer Li's first troll.

451
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,270
You have to face up to that.

452
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,350
You can't seriously blame m...

453
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,400
I wonder what your friends will say
when they realise you started this.

454
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,350
Nobody knows Chronic
Youth is you, right?

455
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,070
Not even Megan.

456
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,120
Will she still be your BFF?

457
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,040
I think I know who you are.

458
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,590
I can't...

459
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,640
I can't even imagine what it must
be like to lose someone you love...

460
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,680
.. especially like this.

461
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,230
I've never lost anyone.

462
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,150
My mum...

463
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,540
She doesn't live with us.

464
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,510
Of course, you know that.

465
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,560
You know everything.

466
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,280
She's not well.

467
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,190
I know what it's like...

468
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,750
.. to have a mum...

469
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,270
who's different...

470
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,320
.. and isn't there for you.

471
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,230
I know what it's like to
go to school every day

472
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,280
and pretend there's not
a problem when there is.

473
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,200
And... anxiety? Well...

474
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,830
I...

475
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,230
I am so sorry.

476
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,280
SO sorry for what happened
to your daughter.

477
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,110
And it makes me feel sick

478
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,160
to think that I was one of
those people who hurt her.

479
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,030
Wrong. I am not Jennifer's father

480
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,470
Well, stepmum, or stepsister?

481
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,990
I know that I'd want
to get back at someone

482
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,110
if they ever tried to
hurt my little brother.

483
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,430
I am not Jennifer's sister, brother,

484
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,510
lover, or anyone who knew her.

485
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,510
WELL, WHO ARE YOU, THEN?!

486
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,560
Why are you doing this, you
pathetic fucking loser?!

487
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,600
< I'm back, Case.

488
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:42,990
< Case?

489
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,840
Careful, Casey.

490
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,590
No daddy, Casey.

491
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,640
You in there?

492
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,710
I'm getting changed.

493
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,230
You going to bed?

494
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,070
What? No.

495
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,790
So what you getting changed for?

496
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,910
Fuck you.

497
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,430
What?!

498
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,950
Nothing! I just...

499
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,030
Can I help you?!

500
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,750
I'm making you something
to eat, come downstairs.

501
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,750
I'll eat later.

502
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,150
Well...

503
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,350
.. just come down anyway.

504
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,600
Barcelona are playing.

505
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,230
What's wrong, Casey?

506
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,230
Can I come in?

507
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,280
No!

508
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,150
I'm fine. Please!

509
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,470
Did you have an argument
with Megan or something?

510
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,920
~ Why would you even say that?
~ I don't know!

511
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,680
How can I know what's going
on if you don't speak to me?

512
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,790
Dad! Just go!

513
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,870
Casey...

514
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,590
No! Dad, please!

515
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,750
What don't you understand
about privacy?!

516
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,550
Can't I just have a minute
to get changed?!

517
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,600
What is wrong with you?!

518
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,800
What is it you want from me?

519
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,800
You want me to admit I'm a bully?

520
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,390
I'm a bully.

521
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,910
You're recording this?

522
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,630
Of course you are.

523
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,680
Make sure you get this.

524
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,430
I...

525
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,480
take responsibility...
for Jennifer Li's suicide.

526
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,470
It was me.

527
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,710
You mean it?

528
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,790
I mean it.

529
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,830
Truth, Casey.

530
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,750
Promise.

531
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,150
Weird.

532
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,350
What's weird?

533
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,150
After all the build-up...

534
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,200
it feels kind of underwhelming.

535
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,760
I think it's because it's insincere.

536
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,510
I believe you'll wait
until I've gone away,

537
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,560
then tell everyone that's some crazy
hacker forced you to confess.

538
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,750
Well, what do you want me to say?

539
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,830
Nothing.

540
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,070
We need action, not words.

541
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,070
What action?

542
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,120
It's time to take your medicine.

543
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,360
I've already had my medication
for today, thank you.

544
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,040
There's going to be a second helping.

545
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,520
'Ask yourself a question, Casey.

546
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,800
'What will life be like
after I've posted this?'

547
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,710
But you said you wouldn't!

548
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,030
'Will it be worth living?'

549
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,790
I've done everything that you asked!

550
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,910
'I asked for three things.

551
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,590
'You've accepted you're a bully.

552
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,630
'You admitted you killed Jennifer Li.

553
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,510
'Now you have to make amends.

554
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,560
'The pills or the pictures.

555
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,320
'Either way, your life is over.'

556
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,830
Fuck you.

557
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,550
'One pill, Casey.'

558
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,510
What?

559
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,560
'All you need to do to stop me from
tweeting this picture is swallow

560
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,520
'one of your little white pills.'

561
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,830
One?

562
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,880
'One pill, one picture.'

563
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,960
'I know what you're thinking, Casey.

564
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,600
'Did you shoot six topless
selfies, or only five?

565
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,710
'To tell you the truth,
in all this excitement,

566
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,760
'I've kind of lost track myself.

567
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,910
'In any case, five or six
pills won't kill you.

568
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,430
'We both know that.

569
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,150
'For this to work,

570
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,200
'we're going to need
some more photographs.'

571
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,350
Leave Megan out of this.

572
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,550
'Take one pill, or it gets tweeted...

573
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,600
'from your account.'

574
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,040
'Time's up.'

575
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,800
No!

576
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,030
'Next.

577
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:47,080
'Your BFF again.'

578
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,270
'One more pill won't hurt you, Casey.

579
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,320
'But it might spare Megan some hate.

580
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,870
'Time's up.'

581
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,840
'Wow. Bad friend.'

582
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,840
'How about this one?

583
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,600
'It's different when it's you, huh?'

584
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,360
'So, you're happy to pop pills to
save yourself from a slut-shaming.

585
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,800
'But you don't mind ruining
your BFF's life.

586
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,240
'Next.

587
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,880
'One pill.

588
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,680
'Wow. Loyalty!'

589
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,790
Ha-ha. You're funny(!)

590
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,840
'Har. Har. You too.'

591
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,880
Go on. Laugh some more.

592
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,040
I'll give you this one for free,
if you laugh at me again.

593
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,760
'O-M-F-A-O.'

594
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,800
No. Laugh at me properly,
you know, har har.

595
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:07,160
'Har. Har. Har.'

596
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,920
Slainte.

597
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,800
I wasn't the first, was I?

598
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,470
I wasn't the first person
to comment on Jennifer Li.

599
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,710
'Of course you were, Casey.'

600
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,790
Show me.

601
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,840
Show me, and I'll take five pills.

602
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,910
'Chronic Youth.

603
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,960
'You were the first.'

604
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,830
Yes.

605
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
But you were the second.

606
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,350
Steerpike underscore 84.

607
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,190
I can tell it's you
from the way you type.

608
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,670
H-A-R. No-one spells it like that.

609
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,670
'Five pills, Casey.'

610
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,950
You must write like that because it
sounds better in the Hawking voice.

611
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,950
You must have got used
to typing like that.

612
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,670
'You're embarrassing yourself.'

613
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,110
Does that mean I can track
you down now, Steerpike?

614
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,910
'Take the pills, or it all goes up.'

615
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,590
84?

616
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,750
What's that, the year you were born?

617
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,800
~ 'Take the pills.'
~ I'll do you a deal.

618
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,670
You leave me alone,

619
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,310
right now,

620
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,360
and I'll forget about Steerpike 84.

621
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,280
'OMFG! This is the funniest
video I have ever made!'

622
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,750
Really?

623
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,430
How many of these have you made?

624
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,830
How many kids have you bullied
to death? What about Jennifer?

625
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,750
You trolled her more than anyone.
You take responsibility,

626
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,800
you sick twisted fuck!

627
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,920
You want me to overdose?

628
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,270
Here's my suicide note.

629
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,110
They'll find it next to me.

630
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,160
And then they'll come and find you.

631
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,750
'Maybe.

632
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,710
'But you'll be dead.

633
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,350
'I still win.

634
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,400
'Now swallow the fucking pills, or
your pics will be online for ever.'

635
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,440
Megan's on the phone.

636
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,840
Case?

637
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,510
I'm not talking to her.

638
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,590
Look, it's none of my business, Case,

639
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,640
but it sounded like
she'd been crying.

640
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,160
I don't care. Tell
her to stop calling.

641
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,720
'Great job, Casey. Outstanding.

642
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,310
'There's only one way
to end the pain now.'

643
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,750
Case?

644
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,910
'He is really starting to annoy me.'

645
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,960
I told her you didn't want to talk,
and she said to give you a message.

646
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,670
She told me to tell you,

647
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,720
"Whatever is going on,
she knows this isn't you."

648
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,110
All right?

649
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,160
Here endeth the message.

650
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,760
'He interrupts again, Casey, I'm
going to have to take action.

651
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:14,630
'Casey?'

652
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:18,670
'No, Casey!

653
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,870
'You stupid, ugly bitch.

654
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,920
'Now you have to start over.

655
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,600
'Where are you going, Casey?

656
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,400
'Casey?'

657
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,230
'Stay where I can see you.'

658
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,310
Need to get rid of this
before it sets in.

659
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,310
There's nothing worse than
a puke smell, don't you think?

660
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,830
'Three seconds, and it all goes up.'

661
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,880
One time, Megan puked all
over her mum's living room.

662
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,280
We were scrubbing that carpet
for hours, and it still stank.

663
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,950
Raspberry vodka puke.

664
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,950
'Three...'

665
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I told her mum it was me, so
she wouldn't get grounded.

666
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,640
'Two...'

667
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,440
She'd do the same for me.

668
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,640
'I'm poting your shit, Casey.'

669
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,390
Poting?

670
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,470
'Posting, bitch.'

671
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,470
You having finger trouble?

672
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,310
Slow down.

673
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,360
Relax.

674
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,600
Go for it.

675
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:10,110
Post what you like.

676
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,350
'Your life is over.'

677
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,400
Is it?

678
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,750
What are you going to do?

679
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,910
Are you going to come here?

680
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,750
And hack my family?

681
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,800
Hack my best friend?

682
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,270
Which reminds me...

683
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:40,320
.. I need to call her back.

684
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,870
'Stay with me.

685
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,920
'I'll tell you who I really am.'

686
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,430
Promise?

687
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,480
'Promise.'

688
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:07,640
I thought you said I'd never know.

689
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,800
I thought you had some super
geek firewall IP rerouter,

690
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,280
and I'd never find out
who you really are.

691
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,150
But you know what?

692
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,200
It doesn't matter.

693
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,240
What are you when I
stop talking to you?

694
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,550
Nothing.

695
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,600
'Case...'

696
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,280
Dad!

697
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,960
Dad!
