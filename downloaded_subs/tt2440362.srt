1
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,821
The girl is born.

2
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,364
This joy shall fill the world.

3
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:30,711
SADAKO 2 -3D-

4
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:36,133
Five Years Later

5
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:48,729
Kagome, Kagome, the bird in the cage,
when, when will you come out?

6
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:57,112
In the evening of the dawn,
the crane and turtle slipped.

7
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:01,450
Who stands right behind you now?

8
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,806
Look, Nagi's all alone.

9
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,609
Hello? How is it?

10
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,617
Oh, I see...

11
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,292
I get it. Okay, I'll be waiting.

12
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,798
What? A girl's voice?

13
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:44,762
Huh?

14
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,555
There's no child here.

15
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,519
Okay, bye.

16
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,404
No!

17
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,967
Yuki Kindergarten

18
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,067
My mommy's coming for me soon.

19
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,321
Your mommy, Nagi?

20
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,825
Why's she never here?

21
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,538
Is she dead?

22
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,836
Say something!

23
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,892
Nagi, for you.

24
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,560
Fuko's here.

25
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:55,953
What did you do today? Draw pictures?

26
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,835
Is she your friend?

27
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,171
What's her name?

28
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,180
What do you want to eat?

29
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,069
Hello? Where you at? Movie theater?

30
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,614
Why YOU picking up then?

31
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,786
Anyway, about that. You see...

32
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,583
What?

33
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,797
- What?
- Sorry.

34
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,258
I'm sorry.

35
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,801
What's wrong, Nagi?

36
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,012
A weird kid grabbed me.

37
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,471
Let's go.

38
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,348
You sure?

39
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,078
Asakawa General Hospital

40
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:03,955
Hey!

41
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,168
Ando, there you are.

42
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:15,342
A power problem at the nurses' station.
Go check it out.

43
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:17,886
Okay.

44
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,265
Hey-

45
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:26,895
By the way, your sister called just now.

46
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,564
Get a mobile already.

47
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,609
Sorry.

48
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,743
Aren't you hungry?

49
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:32,043
I know, how about some rice balls?

50
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,384
I want Mom to cook for me.

51
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:51,688
Nagi, your mother isn't here anymore.

52
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,512
Hello? Takanori?

53
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,598
You called?

54
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,520
Yeah. Nothing urgent, but...

55
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,980
- Today...
- How's Nagi?

56
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,822
Uh, well...

57
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,490
- She enjoyed her dinner I...
- I see.

58
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,328
The psych test result:

59
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:33,290
instability and introversion.

60
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:34,749
Well done.

61
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,879
Now on the three steps of
psychotherapy used in Counseling:

62
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:43,550
psychoanalysis, Rogerian approach and
cognitive-behavioral therapy.

63
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:55,478
In psychoanalysis, you dig deep
into the patient's mind.

64
00:14:55,562 --> 00:15:00,650
To look for traumatic experiences
they may be suppressing.

65
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:23,006
Nagi...doesn't know Akane. Her long
lost mother. She died after giving birth.

66
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:31,306
But of course, I can't be Nagi's mother.
Nagi has this emptiness in her heart.

67
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:39,689
Hence, the drawings.

68
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,277
Just relax.

69
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:52,035
Children her age have a wild imagination
we adults can't imagine.

70
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:53,745
Still...

71
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,211
Here.

72
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,600
Ando,

73
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,145
aren't you just

74
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,109
projecting yourself onto Nagi?

75
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,451
You lost your mother to suicide.

76
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:41,251
Children like to blame
themselves to ease their pain.

77
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:47,966
You're still blaming yourself
for your mother.

78
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,308
Stopped dreaming about her?

79
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:00,603
Yes.

80
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,110
I see.

81
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:18,705
Then don't worry.

82
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:22,125
You can bring her anytime. Nagi, I mean.

83
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,351
I've had enough.
Sure, they pay me but still!

84
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,728
Right?

85
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,443
So creepy.

86
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,036
Let's see...

87
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,750
Seiji Kashiwada arrested

88
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,295
for multiple murder five years ago.

89
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:11,633
The verdict was announced today
without his testimony.

90
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:15,887
Kashiwada kidnapped and murdered
a number of women around Tokyo,

91
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,765
disposing their bodies in a well.

92
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:02,267
So, why isn't your mommy here, Nagi?

93
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,021
Tell me, why?

94
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,198
Let's go.

95
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:43,516
Kagome, Kagome, the bird in the cage...

96
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:51,024
Who stands right behind you now?

97
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,027
Yuna!

98
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,155
Yuna! Yuna!

99
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,910
Yuna!

100
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:50,291
Yuna!

101
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,643
Nagi?

102
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,687
Nagi?

103
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:29,682
Cut it out. Don't point the flash at me!

104
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,225
Sorry, sir.

105
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,742
Hey. You okay, Kakiuchi? Are you ready?

106
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:52,163
I'm fine, sir.

107
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,625
May I?

108
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:17,230
Sure. She cut
her own tongue off.

109
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:19,148
Smashed that

110
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,608
and committed suicide.

111
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:26,489
So many messed up
suicides lately.

112
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,034
I mean...

113
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,620
Huh?

114
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:41,712
This here...

115
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,134
She had a kid over?

116
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:49,804
Maybe...

117
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,723
The cursed video clip?

118
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:53,766
What?

119
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,354
Huh? No, never mind. Excuse me, sir.

120
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,693
Fuko, I've had enough!

121
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:07,155
I do have a life, too, you know?

122
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:07,864
Sorry,

123
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,199
Ms. Igarashi. I'm close.

124
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,201
I'm leaving!

125
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,831
Hey you!

126
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,712
Hands off that. It's not for kids.

127
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,257
What?

128
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,060
I'm leaving now.

129
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:42,607
What's with her?

130
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:20,102
Nagi!

131
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:24,732
Nagi! Nagi! Nagi!

132
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,060
Thank you for coming.

133
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,940
Kakiuchi of the Metropolitan Police.

134
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:11,362
We finally meet, Mr. Koiso.

135
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:25,876
Those who see something on
an electronic device commit suicide.

136
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,963
Just like your case.

137
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,257
It's happening all over again.

138
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:41,392
What's the "cursed video clip"?

139
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,522
Why do those who watch die?

140
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:54,572
People with absolutely
no reason to die have died.

141
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,246
Who made it?

142
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,916
Why is it killing people again?

143
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,843
Sadako.

144
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,266
Sadako...?

145
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:34,528
A girl who died decades ago.
She was different, had special powers.

146
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:40,076
But she was feared by others for that.

147
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:44,497
She was thrown into a well alive.

148
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:57,551
What's a girl who died decades ago
have to do with a deadly video clip?

149
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:05,810
A deep grudge-

150
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:20,741
Is there anyone else
who was involved in the case?

151
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,706
Akane Ayukawa.

152
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:33,045
Akane Ayukawa? Who's that?

153
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:40,594
A woman whose body Sadako desired.

154
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:49,812
Mr. Koiso,
I don't get a thing you're saying!

155
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:58,112
Thank you, sir.

156
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:15,713
Sadako...

157
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,068
Laboratory No. 11
Fumika Kamimura

158
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,846
Who's that?

159
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,819
Why are you drawing it?

160
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,114
Cos you'll die.

161
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,407
What?

162
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,677
You're lonely.

163
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:50,349
You draw to forget your loneliness

164
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,101
about your mother.

165
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,066
I can understand your loneliness.

166
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,113
No, you're lonely.

167
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:09,410
No one's there. You're always alone.

168
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:16,250
You're devoting yourself
to work to forget that.

169
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,182
You scared?

170
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:36,437
Scared of me?

171
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,648
No, I'm...

172
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,157
Everyone will die.

173
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:01,545
Professor?

174
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:07,843
Here.

175
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:24,109
She's a great girl.

176
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:34,119
She has the signs of a parentless child.
Blaming herself a bit.

177
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,749
But she'll get over it.

178
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,252
Yes...

179
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,847
She's such a sweet girl.

180
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,310
A nice girl.

181
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:15,619
Nagi?

182
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:19,999
Nagi!

183
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,960
A train is arriving.

184
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:27,464
Please stay behind the yellow line.

185
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,893
Doors are closing.

186
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:44,648
Please stand clear and
wait for the next train.

187
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:55,928
Nagi!

188
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,706
This way.

189
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:40,973
Stand back! Let us through!

190
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,227
You know it.

191
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,151
You know, right?

192
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,822
Know what?

193
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,952
Too many disasters around her.

194
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,709
The kindergarten girl,

195
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:54,338
Ms. Igarashi... The train, too.

196
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,678
Nagi's always there.

197
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,686
Why?

198
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,277
I'm scared of Nagi.

199
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:26,620
I'm more scared of you for saying that.

200
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:37,547
She's causing them, isn't she?

201
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:41,134
Who is she, really?

202
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:50,811
Is she really yours and Akane's child?

203
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,944
Mr. Ando? Takanori Ando?

204
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,992
Who's asking?

205
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,373
Kakiuchi of the Metropolitan Police.

206
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,876
Mr. Koiso told me.

207
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,257
Where is Akane Ayukawa?

208
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:19,478
Akane died...

209
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,148
Sorry to hear that.

210
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,525
Is that it?

211
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:31,573
Akane Ayukawa had a daughter?

212
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,871
She's such a cute girl.

213
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:40,415
How old is she?

214
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,959
Around four?

215
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,463
I'm in a hurry.

216
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:05,727
To Takanori Ando

217
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:10,565
How is Nagi?

218
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:18,031
How is Nagi? How is Nagi?

219
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:50,146
Seiji Kashiwada

220
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:56,319
Kashiwada... Seiji...?

221
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,332
Fuko Ando.

222
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:53,853
How do you know who I am?

223
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:00,068
How is Nagi?

224
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:07,158
How do you know Nagi?

225
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:10,119
And your letters?

226
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,541
I am Nagi's fan.

227
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,045
What?

228
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,344
You're scared.

229
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,974
Scared?

230
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,519
Of what?

231
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,817
Nagi.

232
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:49,951
Saw the cursed video clip?

233
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,205
What clip?

234
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:05,717
Not yet, it seems.

235
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:12,849
Nagi likes you, perhaps.

236
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:16,144
What do you mean?

237
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:22,191
You watch, you die.

238
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:34,787
You came to me for help, right?

239
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:37,832
What?

240
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:42,128
You've always sought Salvation.

241
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,005
No, I...

242
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,090
That's why you came.

243
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:49,677
Your mother's suicide in the tub.

244
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:52,138
How...?

245
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:55,141
You forced her into suicide.

246
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:58,102
When she needed help.

247
00:48:58,353 --> 00:48:59,187
Stop...

248
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,523
You couldn't help your mother.

249
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,025
Stop ¡t!

250
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:14,911
I got off track.

251
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,837
Nagi...

252
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:28,758
Who is she?

253
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:33,763
You think she's really Akane's?

254
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,476
What do you mean?

255
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:43,731
If Nagi's not Akane's,

256
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:46,359
whose child is she?

257
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,490
Sadako.

258
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,910
Sadako?

259
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,122
Who is she?

260
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,292
Despair.

261
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:11,092
Five years ago,
she sowed the seed of despair.

262
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:15,847
With the cursed video clip.

263
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:28,151
And the seed of despair kept growing,
now budding, ready to bloom.

264
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,821
That's...

265
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:36,034
Sadako's child.

266
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,621
Sadako's child?

267
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:50,923
You'll live that terror.

268
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,258
No...

269
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:55,428
You already have.

270
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:03,144
I know two ways to end that terror.

271
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,817
Want to hear?

272
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,124
One is...

273
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:31,005
Fuko, you die.

274
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:35,593
The other...

275
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:40,598
Pick the bud, soon to bloom.

276
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,103
You...

277
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:50,733
...kill Sadako's child.

278
00:51:53,736 --> 00:52:00,952
The terror will keep growing.

279
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:54,755
Fumika Kamimura

280
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:55,882
Professor?

281
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,673
Professor?

282
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,573
No!

283
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:13,894
Why won't you help me?

284
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:15,313
Mom!

285
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:17,815
Mom!Mom!

286
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:21,485
Mom!Mom!

287
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:24,613
Mom!Mom!

288
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:28,117
Mom!Mom!

289
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:34,332
Mom!Mom!

290
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,585
Don't go, Mom!

291
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:38,544
Mom!

292
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:01,650
Why won't you help me?

293
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:20,378
Nagi...

294
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:56,932
Sadako...

295
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:01,395
Auntie.

296
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:08,652
I'm hungry-

297
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:46,023
Why won't you help me?

298
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:50,027
Why won't you help me?

299
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:55,866
Why won't you help me?
Why won't you help me?

300
00:58:55,950 --> 00:59:01,830
Why won't you help me?
Why won't you help me?

301
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:04,166
I'm sorry... So sorry...

302
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,795
Why won't you help me?

303
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:03,077
Hey, Fuko!

304
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,204
Fuko, what's wrong? Tell me.

305
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:09,917
- I killed her! I killed Mom!
- Fuko!

306
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:12,795
Fuko, get a grip!

307
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:17,299
Mom killed herself! It wasn't your fault!

308
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:19,385
You were small,

309
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:21,887
but tried to help her.

310
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,192
It's okay, Fuko.

311
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:41,699
Mom's suicide wasn't your fault.
I know that for sure.

312
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,330
Takanori...

313
01:01:53,043 --> 01:02:00,509
Sorry I left you alone.

314
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:04,138
Listen, I quit my job.

315
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:07,933
I'll be with you from now.

316
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:12,688
So you won't be alone.

317
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:17,651
Really?

318
01:02:19,695 --> 01:02:24,825
Yeah. Everything will be alright now.

319
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,620
With Mom...

320
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,166
And Nagi, too.

321
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:40,883
Let's have dinner. Nagi's waiting, too.

322
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,811
Yeah? What is it?

323
01:02:58,901 --> 01:02:59,985
No!

324
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:52,704
You kill Sadako's child.

325
01:04:45,716 --> 01:04:47,593
Let's go home.

326
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:39,353
Where are we going?

327
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:45,400
Auntie?

328
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:12,464
You'll kill me?

329
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,012
You don't like me?

330
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,521
Why's everyone scared of me?

331
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:35,153
I want to see Mom.

332
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,578
I'm so sorry...

333
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:46,456
So sorry...

334
01:08:47,082 --> 01:08:48,875
- Sorry...
- I'm scared.

335
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:53,713
I can see people's deaths.

336
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:58,718
Help me, Auntie, help me...

337
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:30,584
You know, we haven't spoken
like this in ages.

338
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:38,091
When you're home, you avoid me.

339
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:41,678
I'm busy.

340
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,263
I need to go.

341
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:45,557
Nagi needs your help.

342
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,107
Nagi...

343
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:56,526
She said so.

344
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,907
Nagi...

345
01:10:03,575 --> 01:10:06,119
She may not be ordinary.

346
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:13,251
But that's not what she wants.

347
01:10:17,005 --> 01:10:22,177
I... I want to help her.

348
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:29,517
Tell me the truth.

349
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:32,938
Is Nagi...

350
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:37,067
...Sadako's child?

351
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:58,797
Akane...

352
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,259
She's alive.

353
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:56,289
Five years ago,

354
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:59,959
Sadako appeared before Akane and I.

355
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:04,506
Akane has special powers.

356
01:13:06,216 --> 01:13:09,052
Sadako tried to use Akane's body

357
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,388
to be born into this world.

358
01:13:14,099 --> 01:13:15,683
But Akane...

359
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:20,688
She trapped Sadako in her body.

360
01:13:22,941 --> 01:13:24,317
Soon after,

361
01:13:25,402 --> 01:13:27,320
Akane got pregnant.

362
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:32,826
That's Nagi?

363
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:41,334
Akane is still fighting all alone.

364
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:51,845
Nagi has been drawing Akane's picture.

365
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,273
Nagi has...

366
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:08,486
...always wanted to see her.

367
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:11,739
Can't they meet?

368
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:15,743
No, if Nagi sees Akane,

369
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:18,663
Sadako will be resurrected.

370
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,373
But that's...

371
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:23,668
They had to be separated.

372
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:30,383
That's why Akane...

373
01:14:30,884 --> 01:14:33,303
She has taken on everything
and stayed here.

374
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:38,766
Akane has been...

375
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:42,187
...preventing Sadako's power

376
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,898
from reaching Nagi?

377
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:47,734
Yeah.

378
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:49,611
Then the recent cases

379
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:53,656
weren't Nagi's fault?

380
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:56,826
It's not Nagi.

381
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:01,539
Then who?

382
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:50,171
Nagi! Nagi's missing!

383
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:52,423
Nagi's missing?

384
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,137
Nagi...

385
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,517
Takanori!

386
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:10,316
Nagi...

387
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:29,836
So... she is alive?
Akane Ayukawa.

388
01:16:30,962 --> 01:16:32,338
Don't move!

389
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:36,175
Nagi...

390
01:16:50,857 --> 01:16:53,443
I'll kill them both.

391
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:56,904
Somebody must end this!

392
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:01,242
Nagi, run!

393
01:17:14,005 --> 01:17:16,257
Nagi, run!

394
01:17:21,638 --> 01:17:26,225
Nagi... Nagi! Nagi... Run...

395
01:17:39,364 --> 01:17:41,908
Nagi, run!

396
01:18:34,252 --> 01:18:36,254
I said, don't move!

397
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:47,890
Yeah... me, too...

398
01:18:50,518 --> 01:18:53,104
I finally saw it.

399
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:57,191
The cursed video clip.

400
01:19:04,782 --> 01:19:06,534
It was her.

401
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:13,666
My wife was...

402
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:22,008
Killed by her!

403
01:19:24,469 --> 01:19:28,890
The cursed video clip... it's her doing!

404
01:19:29,599 --> 01:19:32,393
No, it's not Nagi!

405
01:19:32,894 --> 01:19:37,398
Both she and her mother have evil blood!

406
01:19:37,482 --> 01:19:39,066
No, they don't!

407
01:19:41,027 --> 01:19:42,779
Before I die,

408
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,406
I'll end her.

409
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:11,015
Nagi?

410
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,732
Is Mom here?

411
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,488
Why?

412
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:30,117
Why can't I see Mom?

413
01:20:56,686 --> 01:20:58,104
Nagi.

414
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:04,443
Let's go see her.

415
01:22:21,604 --> 01:22:22,980
Mom...?

416
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,396
Nagi...

417
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:08,359
I'm glad you came.

418
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:50,002
No...

419
01:24:55,925 --> 01:24:58,302
Mom...

420
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:04,308
Now, it's over.

421
01:25:09,522 --> 01:25:09,939
Nagi!

422
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:57,403
Nagi...

423
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:05,703
Nagi...

424
01:26:25,723 --> 01:26:27,975
Nagi!

425
01:26:30,978 --> 01:26:32,021
Nagi!

426
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:15,064
Nagi!

427
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:22,905
Nagi!

428
01:29:03,714 --> 01:29:06,216
Auntie...

429
01:29:11,972 --> 01:29:14,308
Nagi.

430
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,542
Do it again.

431
01:29:41,794 --> 01:29:42,795
Ready?

432
01:30:12,658 --> 01:30:16,245
I want you to witness my death.

433
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:21,333
It's not really death

434
01:30:21,417 --> 01:30:23,752
unless witnessed by others.

435
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:29,383
And what you've told me,

436
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:31,552
I finally understand.

437
01:30:37,224 --> 01:30:42,563
Death is merely a passing point.

438
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:48,527
That's right,

439
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:51,947
death is merely a passing point.

440
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:57,411
You can control the world
more after death than when alive.

441
01:31:07,588 --> 01:31:11,258
The seed of despair is growing,

442
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:15,512
budding now, ready to bloom.

443
01:31:17,264 --> 01:31:18,640
And that's...

444
01:31:20,726 --> 01:31:22,060
