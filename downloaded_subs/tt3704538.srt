1
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,692
I love this place.

2
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,153
- Yeah, me too.
- So strange, though.

3
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,230
- Why is it called a river?
- That's, what it is.

4
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:50,492
- Thank you.
- It's dried up, you know.

5
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,245
I actually used to come here
a lot when I was a kid.

6
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,788
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,124
- I used to ride my bike.
- It's our new spot.

8
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,543
What? You're gonna steal
my childhood memories?

9
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,879
No. We'll just make new ones.

10
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,181
- Promise?
- Promise.

11
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:25,319
- Give me that thing.
- Up-bup-bup! My camera, my show.

12
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,197
Besides, you're prettier than I am.

13
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,032
No fair.

14
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,496
- Don't show my face.
- Shut up.

15
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,247
Don't show my face.
Alright, give me that.

16
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,417
- No.
- I'm serious, little missy.

17
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,794
You mess with the bull,
you get the horns.

18
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,330
Don't cry.

19
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:55,073
God!

20
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,354
I love it when you record me.

21
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,231
No, really, I do.

22
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,876
It means that you love me.

23
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,366
What colour nail polish is that?

24
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,785
Since when do you care about...?

25
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,521
Goddammit, Kev.
You know when to turn that thing off!

26
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:19,289
Shit.

27
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,250
Get out here now.

28
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,293
Thought I told you not to leave

29
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,088
your girlfriend's damn
bike in the damn driveway!

30
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,383
- Little slut!
- Slut?

31
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,557
It's what it is.

32
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,862
But it's right up or
it's out of commission.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,027
Kevin.

34
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,697
Why are you so fascinated
with this thing?

35
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,121
Don't keep me at arm's length, Kev.

36
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:02,140
I'm much more fun in the flesh.

37
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,343
And that's all you get.

38
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,679
- Let go!
- ...and get a job!

39
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,526
Fuck you, Grandma!

40
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,819
- What the fuck?
- Oh, God!

41
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,654
Breaking news at 10:30...

42
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,990
near downtown Los Angeles,
a police pursuit.

43
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,658
- You see that van there...
- Kev!

44
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,535
- Holy shit. That's...
- Kev.

45
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,537
- That's down the block.
- Aren't you gonna talk about it?

46
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,498
Yeah, let's talk about how
awesome this fucking chase is!

47
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,626
Look at this!

48
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,128
Look. It's just down the street.

49
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,505
Kev, put that thing down
and face what's going on.

50
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,049
What's going on?

51
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,510
It's a crazy-ass chase,
headed right for us.

52
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,846
What do you think's gonna happen?

53
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,515
You think that shit's gonna go viral?

54
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,059
You're gonna become famous?

55
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,019
I got... I have to go shoot this.

56
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,105
It's sick, Kev. Put that thing down.

57
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,453
Come on, babe, this...
This is my chance.

58
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,530
Haven't you ever wanted to be a
part of something bigger than you?

59
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,415
Holy shit! Oh, my God.
It's here, it's here, it's here.

60
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,683
You made me miss it. Fuck!

61
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,254
- Fuck, fuck!
- Kev!

62
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,382
- Oh, my God, it's here.
- Come back!

63
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,301
Shit, shit, shit! It's right here!

64
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,470
Jesus Christ, Grandma!

65
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,097
- You little pervert!
- Move! Move! Shit.

66
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,224
You're gonna make me
fucking miss it. Shit, shit.

67
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,647
Fuck! Fuck! I missed it.

68
00:04:58,638 --> 00:05:01,910
Get back inside! It's not safe
out here. Are you filming me?

69
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,454
I'm on my property, man.
I'm on my own property right now.

70
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,766
Seriously!

71
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,044
Starting to see quite a
few pedestrians now...

72
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,006
...in the age of Twitter and YouTube,

73
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,593
people can track this sort of thing
and try to get in on the action,

74
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,973
get their special shots of
the driver or the action.

75
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,059
This guy is travelling at
such a high rate of speed

76
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,602
through these residential
neighbourhoods.

77
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,280
Definitely don't wanna be out
there making yourself a target.

78
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,787
Thank you, honey. You made me miss it.

79
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,782
Iris, what the hell? I'm sorry.

80
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,243
- Get back inside!
- What the hell?

81
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,121
I'll tase your ass if you don't
get inside right now, goddamn.

82
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,664
Iris, get out of the street.

83
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,584
I told you to get off the
street and turn that thing off!

84
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,880
Holy shit! Oh, my God! Iri... Iris!

85
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,871
Just come in and have a seat.

86
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,652
I'm Detective Hughes.

87
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,571
I'm gonna have to record
this conversation, OK?

88
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,531
- OK.
- Tell me your full name.

89
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,325
My name is Scarlett Kay.

90
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,536
And what is your occupation, Miss Kay?

91
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,830
I'm a magician's assistant
for Dante the Great.

92
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,595
The tape that you brought in to us,

93
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,847
where did you find that tape?

94
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,892
In his dressing-room,
there's a secret compartment

95
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,194
behind the breaker box.

96
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,197
Dante recorded everything.

97
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,533
He always needed an audience.

98
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,578
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

99
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,540
Thank you so much for coming
out to the show tonight.

100
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,542
The magician known as Dante the Great

101
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,469
was arrested today.

102
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:22,467
So just two years ago,
Dante the Great was John McMullen,

103
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,762
and he was living in a
trailer park in Atlanta

104
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,181
barely making ends meet,
couldn't pay the rent.

105
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,892
He would do tricks for his
friends in the neighbourhood,

106
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,769
and he was real good at it.

107
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,398
Cut the cards. Alright. Alright.

108
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,276
- Yeah, that's the blue...
- Pretend like you didn't see.

109
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,819
Figured out the trick!

110
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,154
Why don't you make some
beer appear? Be useful.

111
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,698
You suck, bro.

112
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,076
You guys are real funny for a bunch
of unemployed motherfuckers.

113
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:52,455
Dante came in possession of a cloak.

114
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,375
Nobody's really sure
where he got the cloak.

115
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,504
So the rumours are that
Harry Houdini himself

116
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,090
once owned this cloak.

117
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,770
And it frightened Houdini,
so he got rid of it.

118
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,965
Whoo! Whoo!

119
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:48,270
Well, there's no doubt that the
cloak changed Dante's life forever.

120
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,897
His shows were completely exclusive.

121
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,815
Passwords, knocking on doors.

122
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,665
You gotta know somebody
to even get a ticket.

123
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,532
That was the most amazing
show I've ever seen.

124
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,076
He picked my pocket.

125
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,536
From mid-balcony, he picked
my pocket, from the stage.

126
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,121
I don't know how he did it.

127
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,457
We went into the show
at 7 o'clock in New York.

128
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,751
- We walk out of the doors...
- We're in L.A.

129
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,294
We're in L.A. I...

130
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,463
I'm kind of fucking pissed,
but I'm kind of like,

131
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,507
this is the most amazing
thing I've ever seen.

132
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:30,529
His illusions were on a different
level than anyone else.

133
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,016
Today's magic is dead.

134
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,103
You wanna learn a trick,
go Google it, go find it.

135
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:44,035
It's on Wikipedia.
You will never discover how I do it.

136
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,124
Hewwo, wabbit.

137
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:56,246
Sa!

138
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:04,999
Firefighters arrived on the scene to
see heavy flames on the east side.

139
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:06,506
Not a lot of wind this afternoon,

140
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,659
so they're hoping to keep this
contained to one structure.

141
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,277
No word of any injuries or anyone inside.

142
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:22,122
We have an audience tonight,
so why aren't you working?!

143
00:10:25,307 --> 00:10:26,616
What?

144
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,252
What do you want from me?

145
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,034
Please.

146
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,828
The cloak's power comes
from what's inside it.

147
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:43,052
But he had to feed it, and it
was only hungry for one thing.

148
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,881
Dante. Oh, my God.
Turn that off. It's not funny.

149
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,183
Can you hand me a towel?

150
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,189
Seriously?

151
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,780
There were some people that went missing

152
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,698
that were close to Dante.

153
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,327
Some of his assistants.
No bodies, no evidence.

154
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,254
Just gone.

155
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,552
Tell me what was your first impression
of Dante when you met him.

156
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,847
The first time I met him, I was
auditioning for one of his shows,

157
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:22,559
and I was really nervous...
he was my idol.

158
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,185
Oh, my God!

159
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,147
Scarlett. She's different.

160
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:31,901
I just knew it was her, and we
were meant to work together,

161
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,488
meant to be great together.

162
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,074
So you always wanted to
be a magician's assistant?

163
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,243
No, I want to be a magician.

164
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,786
I wanted to work with him

165
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,290
because I thought I would get to learn
how to do the tricks and the illusions,

166
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,834
but no-one on the crew
knew how he did anything.

167
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,253
It was frustrating, to say the least.

168
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,880
Let's take five, guys.

169
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,550
I know that this can all be
very confusing to begin with.

170
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,218
It can take a lifetime of practice.

171
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,761
And you're... you're brand-new.

172
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:03,892
Let's say you and I just
put all this work aside

173
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,603
and tonight, you have dinner with me.

174
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,189
What do you say?

175
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,483
- No, I have... I have a thing.
- Cancel it.

176
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,036
He's picking me up in an hour.

177
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,866
Clay is my ex-boyfriend.

178
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,510
When's the last time you
heard from Clay, Miss Kay?

179
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,371
A month.

180
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,707
How was your relationship with Clay?

181
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,544
Clay... Clay had a temper,
but... it was OK.

182
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,517
We were OK.

183
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,598
You weren't just an
employee of Dante, right?

184
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:47,118
I mean, you guys had
some kind of relationship?

185
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,289
We became really close,
working together.

186
00:13:53,924 --> 00:13:55,542
How'd you do that?

187
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,238
I'll show you.

188
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,157
We're going to film this one, alright?
That was close.

189
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,160
- We're gonna try it again.
- OK. Alright.

190
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,946
Now, on the count.

191
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,004
One...

192
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:14,629
Hey! Look at that!
Perfect sleight of hand.

193
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:19,270
- He was my friend.
- Just friends?

194
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,437
He was more than just my friend.

195
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:30,728
The tapes that Scarlett
brought in indicated

196
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,940
several violent murders

197
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,776
that incriminated Dante
in the disappearance

198
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,737
of at least two of the
magician assistants

199
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,085
and her ex-boyfriend, Clay Bowland.

200
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,427
Were you aware that Dante
was going to confront Clay?

201
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,747
No.

202
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,475
Sit!

203
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,912
What a dick.

204
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,696
I'm sorry.

205
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,754
My shows are something that will reveal,

206
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,352
from the darkness, great light.

207
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,387
You will come through doorways that
you didn't even know were there,

208
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,182
see something unbelievable.

209
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,436
But you have to believe it because
it's right there in front of your eyes.

210
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,814
- They're recording here.
- Get down!

211
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,816
- Alright, alright.
- These guys with you?

212
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,360
No! No! No!

213
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,195
I guess that, concludes our interview.

214
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,364
I'm gonna need your badge number.

215
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,949
You have the right to remain silent.

216
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,719
The cloak, when he has
it on, he's different.

217
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,624
I can assure you, it's nothing magical,

218
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:18,419
nothing supernatural...
it's just a sociopath.

219
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:26,177
Hold onto your tickets.
It's gonna be a big finale.

220
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,846
What I need right now
from you is the truth.

221
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,308
I can't have any more
stories about magic.

222
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,531
I'm telling you the truth.

223
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,663
I know now that what he does,
they're not illusions.

224
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,374
There. Over there.

225
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,168
It's... magic.

226
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,470
There's no such thing as magic.

227
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,552
What is the first rule?

228
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,637
You never tell the rubes
how the trick is done.

229
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,973
- I saw what you did.
- What do I do with you now?

230
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,683
I know you murdered those women!

231
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,601
It wasn't me.

232
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,849
Not you? What is it? What is that thing?

233
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,319
Real magic.

234
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,239
Get down on the ground! Get down!

235
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,658
Gentlemen.

236
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,811
Welcome... to the show.

237
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,770
No!

238
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,106
Nothing up my sleeve!

239
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,208
Suspect down.

240
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,348
What the hell?

241
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,512
Ta-da!

242
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,026
What are you doing?

243
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,237
Scarlett, stop. Give that to me.

244
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,380
No!

245
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,011
Give me the cloak!

246
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,121
Scarlett!

247
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,392
Give it to me!

248
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,274
You made me do this!

249
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,098
Dante, please.

250
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:01,821
Dante?

251
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,698
I'm so sorry, my dear.

252
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,855
I'm sorry, my dear.

253
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:18,713
Scarlett, no! Wait! No!

254
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,420
So where's Dante now?

255
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,464
That's a great question.

256
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,717
I know our entire department
is looking for him.

257
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:38,179
We have gotten assistance from the FBI.

258
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,264
It's only a matter of time.

259
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,443
I like to think that he's somewhere...

260
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,521
planning his comeback.

261
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,858
We talked. We talked... few months back.

262
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,035
He missed me.

263
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,946
He said he's coming for a visit.

264
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,407
He'll... he'll come. He's coming.

265
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,618
He always does.

266
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,716
He comes home.

267
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,013
Where did the cloak end up?

268
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,803
Nobody knows for sure.

269
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,750
...down through this interchange again

270
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,377
with the LAPD right behind it,
we'll see which way he...

271
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,104
Iris, pick up your fucking phone.

272
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,395
- Kevin. Come here, please.
- Iris. Baby.

273
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,981
Please come, Kev!
I don't know what they're gonna do.

274
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,609
- Please.
- Baby. Don't hang up.

275
00:22:59,202 --> 00:23:00,237
Fuck!

276
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,390
What the fuck?

277
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,340
Hey, what you doing?
You're gonna miss it.

278
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,313
Miss what?

279
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,725
Can you see it?

280
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,356
They're coming this way.

281
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,024
Oh, man.

282
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,668
See it on YouTube, bitches.

283
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,124
Dude!

284
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,210
Holy shit!

285
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,196
- Look, there's another one.
- Look, there's another guy.

286
00:23:59,296 --> 00:24:00,840
Stop!

287
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,383
Stop!

288
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,927
Gotta help me!

289
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,682
They're coming back on the 110 freeway.

290
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,517
He's really picking up some speed.

291
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,535
Stop!

292
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,567
You little prick!
You're slowing us down!

293
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,569
I don't give a fuck
about your guys' video.

294
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,737
- That thing took my girlfriend.
- Will you fuck off already?

295
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,781
Dude, you don't understand.
It's coming back around.

296
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,033
- Yeah, no shit.
- No, you're not listening to me.

297
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,577
It's going in circles on purpose.

298
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:31,800
Why?

299
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,392
Oh, shit!

300
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,862
No! Oh, my God!

301
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,242
Fuck! It's got me!

302
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,329
Take my arm!

303
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:20,085
- Grab him!
- I can't get to him!

304
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,076
Grab him!

305
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,014
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

306
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,016
Look at me, dude! Grab my hand!

307
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,044
Oh, yeah!

308
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,410
No, no.

309
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,214
Marta.

310
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,687
Marta, Marta.

311
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,313
Reports now that there might actually be

312
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:11,067
a hostage situation, so LAPD is
going in a surveillance mode.

313
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,821
Stupid girls bike.

314
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:20,868
Fuck. Oh, shit,
it's turning around again.

315
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,296
Fuck, this can't be happening.

316
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:47,145
How much fucking hot dog
does he want? Go over there.

317
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,605
Fuck the hot dogs.

318
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,732
No, papi. Don't make
fun of your brother.

319
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,651
What's he gonna do about it?

320
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,862
One more strike,
he's back in for five to ten.

321
00:45:55,962 --> 00:46:00,074
Give me a burger before I give
you some matching eye shadow.

322
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,458
This thing has my girlfriend.
Please help me.

323
00:46:10,108 --> 00:46:11,718
Fuck!

324
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,013
You have the cojones to turn me in?

325
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,190
I got your cojones right here!

326
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,522
Who the fuck is that motherfucker?

327
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,733
Lucy, where did you get the camera?

328
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,651
Daddy. He has a trunk full of 'em.

329
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,624
Get rid of it!

330
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:42,200
You'd bring that to my uncle's house?

331
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,878
Do something, Uncle Alberto!

332
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:58,683
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Iris. I'm so sorry.

333
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,221
You touch her, I'll kill you!

334
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:05,086
Erase that.

335
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,551
Help!

336
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,398
...chased by... Oh!

337
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:30,445
Oh, my God. A huge
explosion right below...

338
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:38,524
Pussy!

339
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,860
Don't make it. Don't make it.
Trip, trip, trip, fall, fall.

340
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,570
Don't make it. Don't make it. Fuck.

341
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,031
- Whoo!
- Son of a fucktard!

342
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:46,866
- Why are we shooting?
- Did you get that?

343
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,951
No. Oh, that was the one?

344
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,787
Oh, no. Dude, I wasn't rolling.
Yeah, we gotta go again.

345
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,789
- Did you get it?
- What the fuck, man?

346
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,875
Craigslist ad said you could
operate that shitty-ass camera.

347
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,752
You said your skating didn't suck dick.

348
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,670
You guys are not allowed to be up here.

349
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,715
- Go back to your house.
- Hey, you got that shit!

350
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:05,051
Hey, you've got that shit.

351
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:10,431
Fuck.

352
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,559
Oh-ho! Oh, that was so trill!

353
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:17,146
Oh... just the focus, it was bad.
So, one more.

354
00:49:17,796 --> 00:49:19,507
Get the fuck out of here.

355
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:23,043
Three, two, one, action.

356
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,572
We all good?

357
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,421
All clear, big dog.

358
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,370
Jesus!

359
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,628
- Did you get that?
- Sorry, dude.

360
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:42,338
The battery just, like, fell out.

361
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,715
- We gotta go again.
- What are we paying you for?

362
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,801
If you fucked up my car,
I'm calling the cops.

363
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,719
Dude, fuck you.

364
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,846
Get back in your car.

365
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,983
Merry Christmas, dicks. Put 'em on.

366
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,160
- Oh, fuck that.
- Those are stupid.

367
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,911
Jump into it, and then do a Shamu dive.

368
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,305
And I'm gonna get a shot with this.

369
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:24,088
Whoa!

370
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,340
When you gonna help me out with a ride?

371
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,510
I got a nice vagina
just waiting for you.

372
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,638
- Yeah, right.
- I got the vag on deck all day.

373
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,849
I got vagina all day.

374
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,392
Do it, little homie.

375
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,697
Dude!

376
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,574
Oh, man. Are you OK, dude? My bad.

377
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:54,076
Semper fi, cockbag dick hole!

378
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,923
I'm just directing a Web series
right now about abused dolphins,

379
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:11,397
and then I freelance as a bartender.

380
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:15,055
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! I'm coming.

381
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,974
Keep fighting, keep fighting.
Keep punching.

382
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,144
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

383
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:23,288
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

384
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:31,793
Can't believe we got kicked
out for that shit, dude.

385
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,034
- I woulda shot those dudes.
- Yeah, right.

386
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,620
If it was life or death,
you would have left me chillin'.

387
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,163
- You would have bailed.
- Not even.

388
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,706
Excuse me. Do you have a dollar?

389
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,875
Nah. Take this, though, dude.
I bit the end, but...

390
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,545
I spent all my money on this
fucking filmer guy over here.

391
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,964
I got a stogy left if you want it.

392
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:53,135
You need a light? Oh, yeah. No problem.

393
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:56,096
- Fight the hobo! Bum fight!
- Dude, dude, are you serious?

394
00:51:56,196 --> 00:52:00,226
I go to sleep fucked up, not knowing
I peed in a bottle right next to me.

395
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:03,020
I wake up in the morning, like,
fuck, I need water, you know.

396
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,315
Bro, I grabbed the bottle and
just gulp, gulp, and then...

397
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:08,150
But it still tasted like beer, though.

398
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,153
There's this one time I went and
saw this old '80s hardcore band.

399
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,863
People were front-flipping and shit.

400
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,740
- All of a sudden, I look over...
- Front-flipping?

401
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,867
- People were front-flipping?
- Front-flipping into the crowd.

402
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,619
See, I told you, people can front-flip.

403
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,287
Dude, shut the fuck...

404
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,706
I look over and my homeboy's,
like, throwing kids,

405
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,875
like, just throwing 'em
into the wall and shit.

406
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,419
Little kids?
Throwing little kids into the wall?

407
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,296
No. No, dude. They're, like, 20. Boom!

408
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,423
The fat guy's homie, or should I say...

409
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,967
Was he bleeding?

410
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:36,136
I'm gonna fucking pistol-whip
the shit out of you if you...

411
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,097
Yo, don't touch my shit.

412
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:40,900
Dude, we need a new fucking
spot to finish this video.

413
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,853
My cousin told me about
this ditch in Tijuana.

414
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,189
He said it's always empty,
totally secret.

415
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,833
- You got gas money?
- I'm not paying.

416
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:54,029
Hey, hey! Sam! Hey, Sam!

417
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,116
- Dude, it's Shaun.
- Whatever the fuck. Come here.

418
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:59,201
When are we gonna finish my skate video?

419
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,329
It's done. Hey, do you still
have your dad's credit card?

420
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,331
Dude, we cannot go to TJ.

421
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,292
You know that fool
Carlos in third period?

422
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,711
The cartel stuffed his
uncle in a barrel of acid.

423
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,254
Dude, let's go.

424
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,339
You can go and fuck up
the filming some more.

425
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,717
Tijuana is fine now.
The drug dealers all left.

426
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:17,428
They got... they got firecrackers,

427
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,763
they got weed,
they don't card for alcohol.

428
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:36,405
Yeah, get a bunch.
Get the big ones, the big ones.

429
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:37,948
- Test 'em.
- They only have three.

430
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,700
Make sure they're not a dud. Test 'em.

431
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,719
- Nah, we'll...
- There you go. There you go.

432
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,394
Thanks for the ride. This is a
very serious piece of equipment.

433
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,730
- You have sex, keep it on.
- Alright, cool. I will.

434
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:13,067
This kid throws $20 for gas and
he gets the fucking titty cam?

435
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,693
No, that goes for both of you.

436
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,987
If you have sex, keep your cameras on.

437
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,530
Oh, damn!

438
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,407
You want a swig of this?

439
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,076
Tell your sister to go home.

440
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:23,661
She's got syphil-herp.

441
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,996
But the fact is,
'Faces of Death' and 'Jackass',

442
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,499
they sell more than every
skateboard video combined.

443
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,494
Yo, dude, you know...

444
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:35,047
- You know where the fuck we are?
- I do not! I have been lost for hours.

445
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,590
Seriously?

446
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:39,214
These come-bags are boring.

447
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,887
Is that a fucking earthquake?

448
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,639
I just survived a Mexican earthquake.

449
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:47,434
Hey, how often do you guys
clean your skateboard wheels?

450
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,813
This wasn't what I was thinking of,
but you can skate this, yeah?

451
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:53,440
Yeah, but it smells like your mom.

452
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,492
Do you all know how to climb fences?

453
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,906
Jason, did you turn on your camera?

454
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,200
Turn on these whack-ass titty cams.

455
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,743
- Guys, turn on your cameras!
- Shut up.

456
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,286
Turn on your camera.

457
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,831
It's been... Fuck off.

458
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,419
Pour some for the homies, Gas Money.

459
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,113
Hey, guys...

460
00:55:23,245 --> 00:55:26,857
Hey, dickhead, you think a skinned
kitten would still get views?

461
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:30,477
Oh, got a missed call.

462
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,062
You gonna start filming or what?

463
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,148
Remember that one time
you did a shitty kick-flip

464
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,483
and got more views than porn?

465
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:40,663
There's a bunch of dog shit
in the middle of it.

466
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,574
Dude, this place is weird.

467
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:46,368
I ain't going back, though.
We just walked three hours.

468
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:50,080
Something funky worth showing people.

469
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,623
No-one wants to see you guys

470
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,667
go backward and forward
for four fucking hours.

471
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,210
- Wait. Go on the barrel.
- The barrel?

472
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,713
- Go on top and do a front flip.
- A front flip?

473
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:00,132
Don't come off that barrel
until you do a front flip.

474
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,800
This goes out to your momma.

475
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,977
You be in the front right there.

476
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,388
That was the shittiest front flip...

477
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,390
That fucking camera guy is weird, dude.

478
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,768
I know, and he's got this
weird-ass look on his face

479
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,394
like he wants to touch me.

480
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,480
And Gas Money Kid just
sits there and stares.

481
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:20,110
Want to be immortal, or do you
want to be a giant vagina monster?

482
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,737
I will front-kick your asshole.

483
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:24,364
Some chick, she was all
fucked up at the park.

484
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,366
You know the bleachers,
how there's, like, gaps between?

485
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,369
She fell between 'em, like,
the top one. Like, "Boom, boom!"

486
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,622
- Terrible.
- Yeah, real fucking sad.

487
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,971
- Don't blow off your dick hand.
- At least your mom got two dick hands!

488
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:46,345
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

489
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:48,355
Dude, dude, is that bleeding?

490
00:56:50,734 --> 00:56:53,127
What the fuck? Hot as my balls.

491
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:00,291
What the fuck?

492
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,128
Dude.

493
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,952
Where did she come from?

494
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,162
Is she a ninja? Are you a ninja?!

495
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,789
Dude, your sister followed us here.

496
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,999
- What's wrong with her?
- Hey, I'm just kidding.

497
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,210
Hey. My name's Taylor. But...

498
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,295
No, seriously, though, I'm a director.

499
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,923
Want me to throw you in some movies?
We could do that.

500
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:32,057
Hey, video guy,
your dad's a good singer.

501
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,359
Dude, let's bounce.

502
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,692
Oh, shit! What the fuck?

503
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,820
- Oh, what the fuck, dude?
- Shit! Shit! Shit!

504
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,467
Hey, I'm gonna shoot one of
these motherfuckers, dog.

505
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,303
Oh, shit.

506
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,933
Get that fool, Gas Money, dog!

507
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,685
Get the fuck off him!

508
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:18,520
Come on, Gas Money. Crack him!

509
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,686
Get off that kid!

510
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,158
- Do what you gotta do, man!
- What am I doing, man?

511
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,131
- Where are you going?
- I don't know, man.

512
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:37,957
Dude, back up.

513
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,458
Dude, don't... Get...

514
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:46,115
Oh, my fucking God.

515
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:53,055
- Do crackheads have fire blood?
- Yeah, definitely.

516
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,599
I'll go to the Mexican hospital.
I don't give a fuck.

517
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,935
- Shit. There's more.
- But they go down easy!

518
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:00,103
- They're falling apart!
- They got a disease.

519
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,022
- Dude, use your gun.
- What the fuck?

520
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,120
I only got one more bullet, dog!

521
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:31,510
Where the fuck is Gas Money Kid going?

522
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,903
Oh, shit! Hey, dog.
I think they killed Gas Money Kid.

523
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,850
Don't talk. Just fight!

524
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:10,132
Find a weapon, find a weapon,
find a weapon.

525
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:35,532
Deck-check that fool!

526
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,379
Bitch!

527
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:42,539
Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!

528
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,527
Little fucking bitch! Bitch!

529
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:48,545
He's dead, motherfucker! Help me!

530
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,547
There's more of them!

531
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,894
Dude, they're everywhere!

532
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,325
What are you doing?

533
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,148
Oh, what the fuck?

534
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:10,192
Help, dog! Help!

535
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:14,124
What the...

536
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,868
What's up, motherfucker?

537
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,057
Fuck.

538
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,622
Oh, fuck that! Vámonos!

539
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:16,937
13, motherfucker!

540
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:25,642
- Fuck, man, you all good?
- You were kind of crazy.

541
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,854
Hey, we killed a lot of fools.
Killed a lot of fools.

542
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:31,356
Let's get the fuck out of here, psycho.

543
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,817
Motherfucker, they killed Gas
Money Kid and Camera Guy, man!

544
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,360
What the fuck you supposed to...

545
01:02:37,008 --> 01:02:38,446
Oh, shit.

546
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:53,307
Run!

547
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,649
Go under, dog. Go under!

548
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,069
- Hold 'em off for me, dog!
- Help me, you fucking psycho!

549
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,821
What are you doing?

550
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,595
Just give me a second, fool.

551
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:15,059
Run! Get the fuck out of here!

552
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:20,104
Run!

553
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,608
Come on, motherfucker! Let's go!

554
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:54,182
We're not dead, motherfucker!
Don't stop till the border!

555
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:01,256
Hey, dog, I'm still rolling!

556
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:02,924
Me too! Let's go!

557
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:06,011
Do you feel as bad as I do about
Gas Money Kid and Camera Guy?

558
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,721
Yeah. Come on, dude!

559
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:10,598
Hey, hold up, hold up!
Something's slowing me down.

560
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:13,268
Dude, are you fucking serious? Let's go!

561
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:59,856
Police are warning it's a
very dangerous situation

562
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,608
they are struggling to stay ahead of.

563
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:05,487
There are now reports of 11 fires
burning out of control across the city.

564
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:07,322
People should absolutely
be staying inside.

565
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:09,074
Do not...

566
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:17,749
Stop the fucking car! Please stop!

567
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:19,585
Trust me, baby.

568
01:06:21,684 --> 01:06:22,979
What the fuck?

569
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:25,423
I need your help! I need your help!

570
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:29,219
- You fuck!
- Get out of the car!

571
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:31,137
You keep going. Don't worry about that.

572
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,680
What are you doing?!

573
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,982
Keep going. We could edit that out.

574
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,020
Alright. And just
ignore the guy driving.

575
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,107
Just forget...
Don't even think about him.

576
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:44,705
Trust me, baby, I'm a pro at this.

577
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:49,531
Yeah, right there.
Oh, yeah, that's beautiful.

578
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:53,743
That's it. Take it slow, slow.
Slow gets 'em.

579
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:56,121
Slow is what sucks 'em in.

580
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:58,915
Aren't you gonna join me?

581
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:02,293
I only like to watch, baby.

582
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,422
Make sure you're in focus.

583
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:11,719
Yeah. They know they can't touch you,
and it gets 'em even more.

584
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:14,597
- That's it, slow.
- You don't recognise me, do you?

585
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:18,184
I do this eight days a week, baby.

586
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,979
I might have seen... I don't know.

587
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,648
I don't know why,
but I don't know how to...

588
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:25,400
Now do you recognise me?

589
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,527
What? What the f...

590
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:29,529
- Turn around, you...
- Sorry!

591
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:31,448
- Fuck with my rhythm!
- Sorry.

592
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:36,803
One more. OK. Now keep going.
Keep going. We could edit that out.

593
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:42,000
That's it. Don't worry about anything.

594
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,127
We're in our own little sanctuary.

595
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:48,256
Yes, yes. Drowned in slow.

596
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:51,468
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're good.

597
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:53,261
You're very... I knew you were hot.

598
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:55,013
- Yeah? You like...
- Don't... don't talk.

599
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,764
It's better if you don't talk.

600
01:07:56,864 --> 01:08:00,059
- Just show me.
- OK.

601
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:05,064
That's it. Very good. Nice and slow.

602
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:09,027
That's it, touch yourself.
Rub it. Attagirl. Yeah.

603
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:11,704
- Camera. Now!
- What the fuck?!

604
01:08:12,804 --> 01:08:14,716
Don't shoot my face! Don't shoot my face!

605
01:08:14,816 --> 01:08:18,411
Who cares about your face, asshole?
Let's see that pretty body of yours.

606
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:21,039
- Go ahead, strip.
- Fuck you, bitch!

607
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:23,182
Do it. Do it now.

608
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,586
How does it feel, huh?

609
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:29,589
Wow. You're the whole package.

610
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:32,592
I can't wait to introduce you to my mom.

611
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,719
Fuck this shit.
Hundred bucks or no hundred bucks!

612
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,804
Keep driving.

613
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:40,975
Maybe I'll make your retarded
friend strip next, huh?

614
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:44,562
A little threesome?
What a turn-on you are, yeah.

615
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:48,650
- So good, baby.
- Wait a second. I know you.

616
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:52,153
Yeah. Millions of guys do,
thanks to your website.

617
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,197
It was your ex-boyfriend.

618
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:55,865
You shouldn't have dumped him, lady.

619
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:59,244
I didn't film you. All I did was
buy the footage for my blog!

620
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:03,248
I got a blog.
It's called nutlesswonders.com.

621
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:05,833
Oh, don't! Please, don't!

622
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:09,295
Lesson learned!
Loud and fucking clear, man!

623
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,006
- I'll take it down. I promise!
- My tits made you money.

624
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:15,593
So now I'm here for my cut.
Here's the good part.

625
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:18,888
I bet people will pay to watch
me shoot your dick off.

626
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,432
Want to see whose video gets more hits?

627
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:23,560
Let's make a hole in you
and show the world.

628
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,729
Oh, yeah, bitch?!

629
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:31,025
Come on, let's see that star now,
get this thing to turn out like I told you.

630
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:35,154
You want to do it now, bitch?
Stick it out or I'll fucking turn it purple.

631
01:09:36,054 --> 01:09:38,733
Yeah, who's got you now, you smart-ass?

632
01:09:39,022 --> 01:09:40,745
Hey, you want a cut?

633
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:07,872
Something's going on.

634
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:11,142
This is absolutely insane.
Are you sending out...

635
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:04,387
Help me! Kevin!

636
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,923
Kevin.

637
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:44,693
Why are you so fascinated
with this thing?

638
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:49,348
Don't keep me at arm's length, Kev.

639
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,278
I'm serious, little missy.

640
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:04,001
- You mess with the bull...
- Don't cry.

641
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:09,911
Yeah? It's our new spot.

642
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,579
What? You're gonna steal
my childhood memories?

643
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,081
No. We'll just make new ones.

644
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:17,260
- Promise?
- Promise.

645
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,842
Iris?

646
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:38,523
- Kev?
- Iris?

647
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:41,192
You're filming it, aren't you?

648
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:44,529
That's so good, baby.
That means we'll be a part of it.

649
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,989
A part of what?

650
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,542
We're gonna finish it.

651
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:55,456
What are you talking about?

652
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:57,975
I think you know.

653
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,134
Oh, my God.

654
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:09,686
It's been filming us the whole time.

655
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,815
What the fuck?!

656
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:17,728
You're sick, Kev.

657
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:19,355
- We're all sick.
- Oh, my God.

658
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,525
What did I do? Oh, my God.

659
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,372
What the fuck?

660
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,614
Iris, where are you?
Iris, tell me you're OK.

661
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,962
Just start the upload.

662
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:35,705
I ca... I can't.

663
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:39,250
Haven't you ever wanted to be a
part of something bigger than you?

664
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:41,168
You don't know what's
happening out there.

665
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:43,462
These videos, they...
they fuck people up.

666
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,006
Do it.

667
01:14:45,838 --> 01:14:46,966
Do it.

668
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:48,926
I...I can't. I can't do it.

669
01:14:49,982 --> 01:14:52,430
- Do it.
- I can't. I can't do it.

670
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:55,516
Haven't you ever wanted to be a
part of something bigger than you?

671
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:56,809
You don't understand what's happening.

672
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:59,270
- Jesus Christ!
- Do it!

673
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:01,814
Fuck, fuck! Stop! Wait, wait, OK.

674
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:04,412
Stop, stop. I'll do it.

675
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,627
Fuck.

676
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:22,752
Gonna go viral.
This shit's gonna go viral.

677
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:26,505
This shit's gonna go viral.
This shit's gonna go viral.

678
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,717
- This shit's gonna go viral.
- Oh, fuck. What did I do?

679
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:33,137
What the fuck? What have I done? No.

680
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:35,598
- This shit's gonna go viral.
- What is going...

681
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,642
This shit's gonna go viral.

682
01:15:38,289 --> 01:15:39,894
Jesus Christ! Stop, stop!

683
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:42,063
- Stop it!
- Gonna go viral!

684
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:45,107
This shit's gonna go viral!
This shit's gonna go viral!

685
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,307
Gonna go viral!
