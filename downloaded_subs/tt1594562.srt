1
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:46,903
- What's up, Claire?
- Hey.

2
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:49,805
So this is it, huh?
Just you and me?

3
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:52,343
- End of days.
- Yeah.

4
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,481
Have you talked to Ron?
Really?

5
00:03:55,482 --> 00:04:00,907
Ron is in Barbados snorkeling to the
ever-elusive double back sablefish.

6
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:04,363
And he left exposed instructions
not to be disturbed.

7
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:08,406
You know, well, If you own this place,
you'd be at the Barbados too.

8
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:12,356
Sure I would, especially if I had two suckers
back at home waiting and cover for me.

9
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,930
- Did you get your camera fixed?
- No. It's totaled.

10
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:21,583
I have to send it back
to Pentax's suck-ass.

11
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:26,146
I have my microphone, though. So we can
make do with the EVP investigations.

12
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,979
Okay.

13
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:31,301
Oh, hey.
That reminds me.

14
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,837
I have to show you something.

15
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:42,250
So, I was trolling around on some
of the paranormal forums last night.

16
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:46,207
And I came across something pretty interesting.
You definitely gonna wanna see this.

17
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,945
What is it?

18
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:51,017
Hold on.
Just watch.

19
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:55,880
Look closely.

20
00:04:56,242 --> 00:05:00,098
I missed it the first time.
It can blow your mind.

21
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:02,795
Really heavy.

22
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:32,881
You bastard!

23
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:34,801
So good.

24
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,511
Oh my God, every time.

25
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:41,465
Oh, my God.

26
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:55,791
What room did you take?

27
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:58,503
- 216.
- Of course.

28
00:05:58,503 --> 00:06:01,805
Hey, I've been here since last night.
This is just the way it goes.

29
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:04,478
225 is taken.

30
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,943
All the rest is pretty much wide open.

31
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:12,714
Second floor only, I don't remember.
The third floor is already done.

32
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:14,953
Only one guest? Brutal.

33
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:18,147
It don't take a genius to get why
this place is going out of business.

34
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:24,583
Okay, I'll take room 214.

35
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:32,403
I figure we'll take 7 to 7 shifts,
something like that?

36
00:06:32,404 --> 00:06:35,733
You're right. Sounds good.
I'll bring it back down.

37
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:03,767
Okay, If I could just
get you to sign that?

38
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:09,856
This is your room key.
Number 224.

39
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:13,553
You wanna head up to the top of
the stairs, and take a right,

40
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:16,554
and then another quick right,
so like a doubly,

41
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:20,823
and then you go about halfway down of the
hallway, and It's on your right-hand side.

42
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:22,749
You can't miss it.

43
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,348
Thank you.

44
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:49,320
Do you know who that is?

45
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:53,284
- It's Leanne Rease-Jones.
- Okay.

46
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,206
She was the mom on
"Like Mother, Like Son"?

47
00:08:57,567 --> 00:09:01,254
- Dude, she is super famous.
- Okay, whatever.

48
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:08,489
Oh, man. Leanne Rease-Jones.
I wonder what she's doing here.

49
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:13,084
She's guest speaking at some
convention in Pots Town.

50
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,682
- How do you know that?
- She told me.

51
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:19,938
- What? What else did she tell you?
- Nothing. Why are you acting so weird?

52
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:23,982
- I'm not.
- Well, here is her autograph. Just relax.

53
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:26,254
Whatever.
Why are you being so grouchy today?

54
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:29,470
I'm not. I'm just stressed.
This site is killing me.

55
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:32,123
Let me see it.

56
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:42,368
Looks good.

57
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:44,764
I hate web design.

58
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:47,955
It looks really good.

59
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:50,659
I like the little ghost.

60
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:55,405
It's not the most professional,
but it's not bad.

61
00:09:55,406 --> 00:09:58,989
There's a lot of money in this right now,
I just... I have to act fast.

62
00:10:00,489 --> 00:10:03,830
Looks really good.
I like it.

63
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:07,563
And, you know, once you get some proof on that,
It won't matter what it looks like.

64
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,923
Hey, so I was thinking...

65
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:16,797
It seems like whenever something really creepy
happens, nobody else is around, right?

66
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,209
Like every time you've seen stuff,
you were alone. So...

67
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:26,904
I was just thinking that since
the hotel is practically empty,

68
00:10:26,905 --> 00:10:30,497
we might have a good chance
of making some real contact.

69
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:33,163
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah.

70
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:38,401
Yeah. I think this weekend's going to be it.
We're going to get something good, I can feel it.

71
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:46,278
- What?
- What?

72
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,528
- What?
- What?

73
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,757
Front desk.

74
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,970
Yes, Mrs. Rease-Jones.

75
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:03,144
Oh, sure, I'll send them
right up for you.

76
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:04,935
You're welcome.

77
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,975
- I forgot to stack the towels.
- I'll get them.

78
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:12,714
Good, save me the hassle
of that gale on 225,

79
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:15,636
she's driving me nuts and
I don't want her to see me.

80
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:19,054
Uh, that lady with the kid?
I know, what's her deal?

81
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:21,416
She was gonna give me total
aggro vibes upstairs.

82
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:23,554
She had a huge fight
with her husband

83
00:11:23,555 --> 00:11:26,894
and she's staying here till Sunday
with her son as payback.

84
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:29,955
she's having a very hard time
and she wants him to realize

85
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,093
how hard his life is without her.

86
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:36,000
- How do you know all that?
- She told me.

87
00:11:36,568 --> 00:11:39,974
Why do you always seem so surprised
that I talk to the guests?

88
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,377
Go on, superfan, don't keep
the towels waiting.

89
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:06,658
Mrs. Rease-Jones, I have your towels.

90
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:13,993
Mrs. Rease-Jones?

91
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,626
Be a lamb and hand me one of those?

92
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,486
Thank you.

93
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:30,041
You're welcome, Mrs. Rease-Jones.

94
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:34,899
- Call me Lee.
- Okay.

95
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:39,637
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Claire.

96
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:42,891
You're a lifesaver, Claire.

97
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:47,416
Oh, no no no, I couldn't. I couldn't.

98
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:50,654
Come on, you're hurting
an old lady's feelings.

99
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:59,135
Thanks, Mrs... Lee.

100
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:06,860
I am a really big fan of yours.

101
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:11,152
"Like Mother, Like Son" was one
of my all time favorite shows.

102
00:13:11,153 --> 00:13:14,143
And you were amazing in it.
And... And...

103
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:17,236
"The Waking Of Eleanor."

104
00:13:17,811 --> 00:13:19,830
I love that film.

105
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:24,051
I used to watch it all the time.
Crying out with my mom.

106
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:26,905
I even styled my hair in
little braids like you did.

107
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,127
But they never looked good, though.

108
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:34,198
Well, thank you.
That's very nice of you to say.

109
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:39,084
- And what do you do, Claire?
- I work at the front desk. So...

110
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:42,569
If there is anything else that you need,
just let me know. I mean...

111
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,323
This is our last weekend open.

112
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,484
So Luke and I are the only
people on staff today.

113
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:50,797
We actually sleep in here instead
of going home, which is pretty crazy.

114
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:55,805
I meant in life.
Are you an aspiring actress?

115
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:58,881
Is that what makes you such
a stout fan of my work?

116
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:02,599
Me? No.

117
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,435
I just work at the hotel.

118
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:20,341
But... I'm just kind like...
you know, I'm between... stuff.

119
00:14:27,104 --> 00:14:28,304
Okay.

120
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:31,655
Oh, Claire...

121
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:34,694
The towels.

122
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:37,662
Right. Of course. Yes.

123
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,167
There you go.

124
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,967
How'd it go?

125
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,957
You two gonna collaborate on something?

126
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:58,283
She got to make me feel
like an asshole.

127
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:02,024
Well, she is an actress.

128
00:15:02,744 --> 00:15:05,217
What's that supposed to mean?

129
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:08,080
What do you know about
actresses, anyway?

130
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:11,966
I don't know a lot, but I do know a
little bit about a lot of things.

131
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:17,937
Why you have to be such a bummer?

132
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:20,992
And why you have to be so negative?

133
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:23,871
I'm not negative, I'm realistic.
There's a difference.

134
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:30,528
- You're pessimist.
- Pessimism is just a higher form of optimism.

135
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:35,498
If you expect nothing from people, then you
go through life being pleasantly surprised.

136
00:15:36,296 --> 00:15:38,950
Yeah, but nobody loves an albatross.

137
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,583
- I need some coffee. You want anything?
- I do not.

138
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:44,408
Fine.

139
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:15,062
Hey, how's it going?

140
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:19,659
What can I get for you?

141
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,825
I'll tell you what. You take your time,
and if you have any questions, just let me know.

142
00:16:42,056 --> 00:16:45,029
Doesn't a Cyclops always has one eye?

143
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:49,687
What do you mean?

144
00:16:50,223 --> 00:16:52,360
Never mind.

145
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:54,906
I will have a...

146
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:59,700
large soy mocha latte
with a pump of caramel.

147
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:01,190
Good choice.

148
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,329
So how are things going next door?

149
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:13,527
Fine.

150
00:17:20,296 --> 00:17:22,267
Can I speak frankly with you?

151
00:17:22,735 --> 00:17:25,504
I mean, I know we don't know each other
that well, but I see you all the time

152
00:17:25,505 --> 00:17:27,528
and we are all girls here.

153
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:31,591
This Sunday my boyfriend is taking
me on a picnic to the bay.

154
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,479
And I'm really excited. I know
is gonna be super romantic

155
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,105
and I think that I'm not letting
myself be fully excited

156
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:42,537
because there's something in our
relationship that's been bothering me

157
00:17:42,637 --> 00:17:46,657
which that we've been together for almost a year
and he still has not told me that he loves me.

158
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:50,618
And I just need to talk to somebody about it
because I don't wanna ask him to tell me.

159
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,600
And he said it on IM.
That's the thing. He said it on IM.

160
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:56,180
Which my friends say that it doesn't count.
It's like saying "I love you" during sex.

161
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:57,380
It doesn't count.

162
00:17:57,591 --> 00:17:59,466
And so I wonder...

163
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,119
Where is your coffee?

164
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:09,331
They ran out.

165
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:15,362
Is that annoying girl still there?

166
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:17,986
Yes.

167
00:18:19,518 --> 00:18:22,558
What a failbug.

168
00:18:23,123 --> 00:18:24,658
Epic.

169
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:41,706
Do you ever think about when
you dropped out of the college

170
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:44,064
and wonder if you made
the right choice?

171
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:47,305
Every day.

172
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:50,840
Why do people have
such high expectations?

173
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:58,608
Everything happens
for a reason, Claire.

174
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,286
Nobody just ends up
at the Yankee Pedlar.

175
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:06,279
I guess.

176
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:12,777
- You know what really gets me though?
- Hold that on.

177
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:15,673
My eyes feel like they've been
doused with xxxxxxxx

178
00:19:15,674 --> 00:19:17,626
I need to go upstairs.

179
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:24,032
What?

180
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:29,171
I'm sorry. I'm dead. We can talk about your
upcoming quarter life crisis tomorrow.

181
00:19:29,531 --> 00:19:32,375
- I just need to tap out right now.
- Fine.

182
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,702
Leave your computer, though.

183
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:40,652
What? I'm not gonna hack the system.
I just want look for a pair of high tops.

184
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:45,211
And it gets really boring when
there's nobody else in the hotel.

185
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,976
And my book sucks.

186
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,908
Okay, just be careful with it.

187
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:54,556
Dah.

188
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:57,577
Oh, and if you get the itch
to do any recording,

189
00:19:57,578 --> 00:19:59,906
the recorder is charging
in the back office.

190
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,814
Remember how to use it,
you just point the microphone in the...

191
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:04,584
I know how to do it.
I get it.

192
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:08,298
Jesus, I would hate to be
a ghost in this hotel.

193
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:16,571
- Goodnight, Claire.
- Goodnight, Luke.

194
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,286
Where is your website?

195
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:32,465
Well done. I might forget
to remind him about this.

196
00:22:46,171 --> 00:22:48,858
Tragedy.

197
00:22:50,678 --> 00:22:52,083
Creepy.

198
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:37,620
Shit.
I can't work this thing.

199
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,161
I don't wanna scare you,
but I stand right behind you. Sorry.

200
00:24:35,162 --> 00:24:37,475
Fuck! What the fuck?!
Oh my God!

201
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,519
Jesus Christ, you scared
the shit out of me!

202
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,644
What are you doing over here, anyway?

203
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:45,478
- I thought I heard a noise, Luke.
- Like what?

204
00:24:47,113 --> 00:24:49,858
Banging, like a banging, man!

205
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:52,151
- Okay, well...
- God!

206
00:24:52,152 --> 00:24:55,570
I woke up and I couldn't get back to sleep.
So we can switch now, if you want.

207
00:24:55,571 --> 00:24:58,493
Fuck. Okay. Dah! Dah!

208
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:00,503
Sorry.

209
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,842
Fuck you.

210
00:25:20,515 --> 00:25:23,268
Do you know the story
of Madeline O'Malley?

211
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:26,509
She was the one that
died here in the hotel.

212
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:31,604
She hung herself after her fiance
stood her up on her wedding day.

213
00:25:36,306 --> 00:25:41,364
The original owners of the hotel, thought
it would be bad press and hurt the business.

214
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:47,382
So, they hid her dead body in
the wood cellar for three days.

215
00:25:47,383 --> 00:25:50,954
Before they could smuggle
her out of the loading bay.

216
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:54,486
When the people of the town finally
figured out what had happened here...

217
00:25:54,487 --> 00:26:01,425
they were outraged. So, the owners had to
close the hotel down and were forced to sell it.

218
00:26:02,008 --> 00:26:04,880
Nobody came through here
again until the '60s.

219
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:11,129
And ever since then, people have reported
seeing the ghost of Madeline O'Malley

220
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,831
roaming the hallways
waiting for her lover.

221
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:19,501
Some say, she's even looking
to take up a new one.

222
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,428
Excuse me?
What are you doing?

223
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:25,024
Mommy.

224
00:26:25,939 --> 00:26:27,537
What's going on?

225
00:26:27,538 --> 00:26:31,298
She said there's a ghost in that hotel.
She said it's coming to get me.

226
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:34,175
- I never said that.
- What's the matter with you?

227
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,022
He's just a child.

228
00:26:36,023 --> 00:26:38,392
Sweetie? Sweetie.

229
00:26:38,393 --> 00:26:40,581
It's okay.
It's not real.

230
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:42,671
It's just a story. Okay?

231
00:26:42,672 --> 00:26:44,672
Right? Come here.

232
00:26:44,892 --> 00:26:49,500
I don't need this.
I've enough going on in my life.

233
00:26:50,098 --> 00:26:51,732
Yes, ma'am.

234
00:26:51,908 --> 00:26:52,984
Are you okay?

235
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:56,160
And you.
We still need towels.

236
00:26:56,161 --> 00:27:00,754
I'm tired of asking.
Don't make me the bad guy in this.

237
00:27:00,755 --> 00:27:02,233
Alright.

238
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:05,723
- We're in the 225.
- Yeah, I know which room you're in.

239
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,794
I work in the hotel.

240
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:12,611
Come on, sweetie.
It's just a silly story, alright?

241
00:27:13,607 --> 00:27:14,907
Okay?

242
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,611
I've bought the cheap bread.
I can taste it.

243
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:45,775
Never skimp on bread.
You'll always regret it.

244
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:50,192
So, why do you think she
sticks around here?

245
00:27:50,707 --> 00:27:52,463
Beats me.

246
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:54,485
The rates aren't that cheap here.

247
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:57,707
"Courtyard by Marriott" on
the route 13 is much better.

248
00:27:57,757 --> 00:27:59,935
No, not her. I mean Madeline.

249
00:27:59,936 --> 00:28:02,090
- What do you think she wants?
- I don't know.

250
00:28:02,091 --> 00:28:06,189
I don't spend my time trying to figure out
what women want. Specially dead ones.

251
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,619
Please.

252
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:12,872
Well, when you saw her,
what did she look like?

253
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:15,006
Like she was all dead looking?

254
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:18,906
The thing about physical encounters is that
you don't really remember the details.

255
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:21,573
It's weird, cause you think
you would, but, it's like...

256
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:24,837
she was there one minute,
then gone the next.

257
00:28:24,838 --> 00:28:27,440
Almost like she was
never in there at all.

258
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:30,208
I know, it's kind of hard to explain,
you just have to be there.

259
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,603
I'm so jealous.

260
00:28:32,604 --> 00:28:36,150
But if I saw her,
probably I'd freak out.

261
00:28:37,224 --> 00:28:40,224
I can't believe that you
never had your camera with you.

262
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:42,820
I know. It kills me.

263
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:46,274
Looking down for some recording tonight?

264
00:28:48,234 --> 00:28:49,486
Definitely.

265
00:28:49,487 --> 00:28:52,608
We gotta find some proof that
Madeline O'Malley really exists

266
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:56,769
before this place closes down, we have to.
I mean, imagine how she feels,

267
00:28:57,086 --> 00:28:59,574
being stuck here forever.

268
00:29:00,385 --> 00:29:02,280
We gotta get something on tape.

269
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:05,003
It's like a moral imperative.

270
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,909
Oh my God.

271
00:32:38,008 --> 00:32:39,309
Shit.

272
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,768
How did you get in there, bird?

273
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:36,509
Luke.

274
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,557
Luke, you are not going to believe
what just happened to me.

275
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:49,509
Luke?

276
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:01,550
What?

277
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:03,411
Never mind.

278
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:08,251
I'm a pumpkin.
I'm gonna kill this snake.

279
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:10,411
Don't forget to record.

280
00:34:10,824 --> 00:34:13,532
I left a list for you on my desk.

281
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,209
Okay.

282
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,341
Enjoy your internet porn.

283
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,594
This is EVP recording
of the laundry room.

284
00:36:00,668 --> 00:36:03,833
Luke, I'm skipping this one.
There's nothing in here.

285
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,420
This is the EVP recording
of the banquet room.

286
00:36:26,676 --> 00:36:30,520
I'm trying to contact the
spirit of Madeline O'Malley.

287
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:36,165
Madeline, if you can hear me,
please give us a sign.

288
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:31,641
Damn it, Luke, you said that
this thing would have been set up.

289
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:27,811
Luke!
Luke, come here, wake up!

290
00:40:28,701 --> 00:40:32,045
- Come on, wake up, wake up, wake up.
- Hold on, hold on.

291
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,210
Luke!

292
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:41,656
What the... f?

293
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,944
Claire, I still have
like two hours left, man.

294
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:47,645
Dude, you have to listen to this.
The piano is playing by itself.

295
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:50,303
I think it was her.

296
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:53,636
Come on, I'll be down at 7:00.
I'll listen to it then.

297
00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:56,387
No, no, I'm scared.

298
00:40:58,121 --> 00:41:01,461
Okay, come in.

299
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,111
Shit.

300
00:41:07,274 --> 00:41:11,315
Actually... I'm...

301
00:41:11,316 --> 00:41:14,173
...okay.

302
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:18,675
Are you sure?

303
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:23,427
Yeah, I think I just freaked out
for a minute but I'll...

304
00:41:24,277 --> 00:41:26,914
I'll be fine.

305
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:27,913
Okay.

306
00:41:27,983 --> 00:41:30,740
Well, I'll be down in
a few hours, alright?

307
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:31,909
Okay.

308
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:55,368
Do you mind keep it down?

309
00:41:56,758 --> 00:42:00,208
Do I have to ask you again?

310
00:42:01,503 --> 00:42:06,013
You know what?
Just back off!

311
00:42:06,014 --> 00:42:07,371
Okay?

312
00:42:07,372 --> 00:42:10,353
You're asking me "what I do"
the other day?

313
00:42:10,354 --> 00:42:13,766
Well, I just recorded an...
unexplainable phenomenon!

314
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:19,815
There's a ghost in this hotel and I got it on tape
and it's a big deal! So just... leave me alone!

315
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:28,733
Come with me for a moment.

316
00:42:55,169 --> 00:42:57,886
Here, sit.

317
00:43:03,491 --> 00:43:06,475
You need a drink.

318
00:43:10,013 --> 00:43:12,319
Cheers.

319
00:43:19,609 --> 00:43:22,509
Are you alright?

320
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:26,700
Tell me about what you saw.

321
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:31,843
- I...
- Look...

322
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:37,725
I'm sorry about yesterday. I have a tendency
not to be a nice person, I know that.

323
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,384
Please don't take it personally.

324
00:43:46,695 --> 00:43:49,560
I don't apologize more than once.

325
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:54,583
Look, I can help you with
what you're looking for,

326
00:43:54,584 --> 00:43:57,524
I just need to know what it is
that you are looking for.

327
00:43:59,568 --> 00:44:02,425
I'm sorry, help me with what?

328
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:16,276
Do you know what this is?

329
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,595
It's a pendulum.

330
00:44:19,596 --> 00:44:24,129
It's used to answer life's more...

331
00:44:25,087 --> 00:44:28,420
difficult questions.

332
00:44:30,692 --> 00:44:32,812
Do you know why I'm here?

333
00:44:32,813 --> 00:44:36,233
You're speaking at an acting
convention in Pots Town?

334
00:44:36,234 --> 00:44:40,124
No, I'm not here for acting.
I am here as a guest

335
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:42,737
at the Healers Gathering.

336
00:44:42,772 --> 00:44:45,827
That's what I do now.
It's my true calling.

337
00:44:45,828 --> 00:44:49,316
Claire, everything in this
world is connected.

338
00:44:49,317 --> 00:44:54,743
Whether we understand that or not
depends on our sense of perception.

339
00:44:54,744 --> 00:44:59,621
Our willingness to communicate. Now, you wanna
communicate with the spirits in this hotel?

340
00:44:59,622 --> 00:45:03,185
I can help you do that.

341
00:45:04,373 --> 00:45:07,695
I just need to know what it is
that you want from them.

342
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:13,906
I don't know if they are real.

343
00:45:13,907 --> 00:45:17,145
- The ghosts.
- Spirits.

344
00:45:18,814 --> 00:45:23,880
There is no "real" in this world,
Claire, it's all a state of being.

345
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:29,472
There are no beginnings.
There are no ends.

346
00:45:29,473 --> 00:45:32,585
There are no ghosts.

347
00:45:32,586 --> 00:45:38,841
We're each divine beings that incorporate
one energy in the universe

348
00:45:38,842 --> 00:45:43,241
like uh... droplets of water
in a vast ocean.

349
00:45:46,292 --> 00:45:51,386
The universe has a plan for
each and every one of us.

350
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:57,535
Now, I want you to ignore what
your conscious mind tells you.

351
00:45:57,536 --> 00:46:00,558
And open yourself up.

352
00:46:02,081 --> 00:46:03,611
Okay?

353
00:46:12,758 --> 00:46:17,939
What is it that you want
from these spirits?

354
00:46:22,215 --> 00:46:29,077
I wanna know if it was Madeline O'Malley
playing the piano downstairs.

355
00:46:29,734 --> 00:46:36,043
And if she really is the spirit
living in this hotel.

356
00:46:44,249 --> 00:46:50,288
Ask again. This time close your
eyes and really concentrate.

357
00:46:52,972 --> 00:46:55,774
Open yourself up.

358
00:46:55,775 --> 00:46:59,221
Really ask and ask it directly.

359
00:47:10,283 --> 00:47:13,722
Are you the spirit
of Madeline O'Malley?

360
00:47:14,789 --> 00:47:18,225
Did you die in this hotel?

361
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:24,056
Was that you playing the piano?

362
00:47:32,455 --> 00:47:35,199
They aren't able
to say who they are.

363
00:47:36,368 --> 00:47:38,488
They?

364
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:41,549
There are three of them.

365
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:45,578
- What do they want?
- The same thing you do.

366
00:47:46,273 --> 00:47:50,615
- What?
- To live.

367
00:47:51,436 --> 00:47:54,247
But they are not alive.

368
00:47:55,955 --> 00:47:59,314
There was a terrible
tragedy in this hotel.

369
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:04,597
Something about the basement.
A mistake.

370
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:11,743
It's her. It's Madeline.
That's where they hid her body.

371
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:20,461
You mustn't go down into the basement.

372
00:48:20,462 --> 00:48:23,543
Why? Is where she's trapped?
Is her spirit trapped in there?

373
00:48:30,793 --> 00:48:32,911
You can't save her.

374
00:48:32,912 --> 00:48:35,944
They tried to warn her.
They tried to help her.

375
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,199
Who's they?
What do they want?

376
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:49,821
What happened?

377
00:48:51,921 --> 00:48:55,228
I lost contact.

378
00:49:58,336 --> 00:50:02,210
Luke... No towels.

379
00:51:59,811 --> 00:52:01,011
Luke!

380
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,010
Okay.

381
00:52:05,011 --> 00:52:10,235
That's it. I've had enough.
We're going back to dad. Okay?

382
00:52:33,404 --> 00:52:35,842
Drink.

383
00:52:36,918 --> 00:52:41,204
Don't worry about Gozer and her demon
seed leaving. You actually did us a favour.

384
00:52:41,681 --> 00:52:44,312
Claire, you're really freaking me out.

385
00:52:44,313 --> 00:52:47,319
You gotta pull it together,
you're way out into the weeds right now.

386
00:52:47,354 --> 00:52:50,358
It happened to me when I first started
messing around with all this stuff.

387
00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:52,877
You really gotta be careful
about what's going on up here.

388
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:56,824
You start thinking you're seeing things,
and it might never stop.

389
00:52:56,825 --> 00:53:01,825
Okay, fine. The dream in one thing,
but... what about the piano?

390
00:53:02,236 --> 00:53:05,904
- And what about everything Lee said?
- I listened to that piano tape...

391
00:53:05,905 --> 00:53:10,430
and I don't know what to tell you.
Maybe it's explainable, maybe it isn't.

392
00:53:10,431 --> 00:53:14,356
But it's not worth getting yourself
worked up over. None of this stuff is.

393
00:53:14,772 --> 00:53:20,067
As for the cook upstairs...
Look, Claire...

394
00:53:20,102 --> 00:53:23,116
How many times have you seen
someone on late night TV

395
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:27,544
talking of their psychic awareness to
an audience full of rubes? Tons, right?

396
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:30,281
And how many times have you seen
a psychic in the newspaper

397
00:53:30,282 --> 00:53:33,691
solving crimes, or healing
someone without medicine,

398
00:53:33,692 --> 00:53:36,585
or winning a lottery.
Almost never, right?

399
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:41,866
That's because is all bullshit.
It's Hocus Pocus.

400
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:44,951
That woman upstairs is just
an insecure old actress.

401
00:53:44,952 --> 00:53:47,311
She's just trying to stay relevant.
It's pathetic.

402
00:53:50,112 --> 00:53:51,312
Okay.

403
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:55,084
Don't you wanna try to figure out
what's going on here?

404
00:53:56,169 --> 00:53:59,722
Why are you not intrigued by this?
I mean, this could be it.

405
00:53:59,723 --> 00:54:04,028
This could be Madeline trying to make
contact and you just don't even care.

406
00:54:04,063 --> 00:54:07,005
Isn't this supposed to be your deal?

407
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:13,058
I swear to God, if that bitch
is back with her kid...

408
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,745
Be cool.

409
00:54:19,898 --> 00:54:25,524
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yes, I'd like a room for the night, please.

410
00:54:25,525 --> 00:54:28,973
- Okay, just one night?
- Yes.

411
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:34,017
I'd like room 353, please.

412
00:54:34,823 --> 00:54:37,870
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
That room is not available right now.

413
00:54:37,871 --> 00:54:40,447
We only have rooms available
on the second floor

414
00:54:40,448 --> 00:54:43,145
because this will be
our last weekend open.

415
00:54:43,653 --> 00:54:52,168
No, I must have room 353.

416
00:54:52,913 --> 00:54:56,162
- Yeah.
- Please.

417
00:55:02,879 --> 00:55:06,545
This is very important to me.

418
00:55:09,267 --> 00:55:14,015
I came a long way.

419
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:20,763
Sir, all the rooms on the third
floor have been stripped, so...

420
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:23,846
if you don't mind
putting up some sheets

421
00:55:23,847 --> 00:55:28,886
and sleeping in a room without furniture,
then, I think we can help you out.

422
00:55:31,229 --> 00:55:34,291
That would be fine.

423
00:55:36,516 --> 00:55:40,182
Okay, well, if I could just get a
credit card for the reservation?

424
00:55:42,191 --> 00:55:44,445
I'll pay cash.

425
00:55:44,446 --> 00:55:48,459
Okay, but we usually need a credit
card in cases of any damages...

426
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:55,169
Take these, please.

427
00:55:58,012 --> 00:55:59,312
Okay.

428
00:56:00,129 --> 00:56:04,669
Let's... go get you some sheets.

429
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,899
Have a nice day.

430
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:21,729
That's very kind of you
helping me out back here.

431
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:26,553
Oh, It's no problem. I mean, I figure... pretty
soon this old place will be a parking lot, anyway.

432
00:56:26,554 --> 00:56:30,912
So, if somebody wants a certain room,
who am I to stop him?

433
00:56:34,953 --> 00:56:37,700
It's really no big deal.

434
00:56:39,532 --> 00:56:42,308
Sir?

435
00:56:56,022 --> 00:56:58,430
Oh, thank you.

436
00:56:59,384 --> 00:57:03,464
353 is where I spent my honeymoon.

437
00:57:04,162 --> 00:57:09,469
This old place holds some
special memories for me.

438
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:13,270
And It's interesting,
come back to a place

439
00:57:13,271 --> 00:57:16,598
feels like you never left.

440
00:57:17,272 --> 00:57:21,431
Almost like you're right at home.

441
00:57:22,088 --> 00:57:26,105
- Don't you think?
- I don't know.

442
00:57:27,097 --> 00:57:30,417
Why don't we take them upstairs?

443
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:48,835
So, like we said, the rooms have all
been cleaned and stripped, and...

444
00:57:48,836 --> 00:57:51,381
most of the furniture and
linen are in the storage.

445
00:57:51,382 --> 00:57:56,947
But, lucky for you, the owner is too cheap to hire
real movers, so all the beds are still here.

446
00:57:57,477 --> 00:58:01,789
The room may not have quite the
same charm that you remember,

447
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:05,129
- but at least you'll not sleep on the floor.
- That's alright.

448
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:09,721
I'm just here for one
last bit of nostalgia.

449
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:13,634
Okay. Well, here we are.
Room 353.

450
00:58:14,439 --> 00:58:17,583
"Honeymoon Suite".

451
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:34,329
And if you change your mind and decide that you
wanna move to a room with TV, just let us know.

452
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:41,045
That won't be necessary.

453
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:45,048
This is just what I came for.

454
00:58:56,810 --> 00:59:00,965
- Thank you so much.
- Okay, well, enjoy your stay.

455
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:29,940
If I wanna stay up all night with you,
you gotta get drunk with me.

456
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:34,482
Cheers.

457
00:59:40,265 --> 00:59:43,066
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

458
00:59:43,067 --> 00:59:46,643
Good. Keep drinking.
That always helps.

459
00:59:55,513 --> 00:59:57,813
- Hi, Lee.
- Hi.

460
00:59:58,208 --> 01:00:00,681
- How was your seminar?
- Very good, thank you.

461
01:00:01,009 --> 01:00:03,518
- How are you two doing?
- Not bad.

462
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:06,831
- Do you want a beer?
- No, thank you.

463
01:00:06,931 --> 01:00:09,668
Really? I heard you're
a huge drinker.

464
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:15,903
Well, we all have our moments.

465
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:19,916
So, Lee, tell me,
how does it all work?

466
01:00:20,609 --> 01:00:25,237
- How does what work?
- You know, being a psychic and all.

467
01:00:28,683 --> 01:00:30,413
Well...

468
01:00:31,506 --> 01:00:35,815
Have you ever been
somewhere new and sworn

469
01:00:35,816 --> 01:00:38,947
- that you've been there before?
- Like a deja vu.

470
01:00:38,948 --> 01:00:41,200
Exactly.

471
01:00:41,201 --> 01:00:44,414
Well, if you've ever experienced
what you call a deja vu,

472
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:47,369
then you have the same
God-given ability I have.

473
01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:53,332
In fact, we all do.
It's just that...

474
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:56,927
Sometimes my deja vu's happening
in another direction.

475
01:00:57,531 --> 01:01:01,195
I can experience certain
feelings before they happen.

476
01:01:01,196 --> 01:01:04,627
It's not always clear when or
where they come from.

477
01:01:04,628 --> 01:01:06,955
So I have to be very careful in...

478
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,540
what I choose to share.

479
01:01:12,415 --> 01:01:13,834
Okay.

480
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:24,399
I'm really tired, so I'm gonna go upstairs
and go to sleep. It's been a long day.

481
01:01:24,707 --> 01:01:27,982
I'll come find you tomorrow
before you leave. Lee.

482
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:35,891
Don't let the spirits
keep you up all night.

483
01:01:38,568 --> 01:01:42,623
Dude, you don't need to say that.
That was really mean.

484
01:01:43,288 --> 01:01:46,987
Oh, whatever. You said it yourself.
She made you feel like an asshole.

485
01:01:48,752 --> 01:01:52,534
Besides, everybody needs a taste of
their own medicine once in a while.

486
01:01:59,831 --> 01:02:02,740
- Do you want another one?
- Yeah.

487
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:22,855
- Alright, are you ready?
- Yeah.

488
01:02:28,915 --> 01:02:33,326
Okay, this is Claire's haunted
re-enactment. Take one.

489
01:02:33,327 --> 01:02:37,920
Interior. Yankee pedophile.

490
01:02:46,803 --> 01:02:49,699
Was that the piano?

491
01:03:14,969 --> 01:03:17,389
What?

492
01:03:17,885 --> 01:03:21,763
Is it playing by itself?

493
01:03:23,293 --> 01:03:27,499
It must be the ghost of Madeline O'Malley
trying to tell me something.

494
01:03:31,113 --> 01:03:34,397
Show yourself, spirit.

495
01:03:35,697 --> 01:03:39,442
I said, show yourself, spirit!

496
01:04:19,096 --> 01:04:21,165
There she is.

497
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:25,206
Poor, poor, Madeline O'Malley.

498
01:04:32,615 --> 01:04:35,892
Do you think she's prettier than me?

499
01:04:35,893 --> 01:04:38,287
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

500
01:04:38,288 --> 01:04:41,031
She's a little homely for my taste.

501
01:04:41,032 --> 01:04:44,159
I think you're much prettier, Claire.

502
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,254
Thank you.
That's nice of you to say.

503
01:04:47,534 --> 01:04:52,041
In fact, Claire, I think you are
one of the prettiest girls I know.

504
01:04:54,315 --> 01:04:56,889
Who are the others?

505
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:01,388
My mother, my sister...

506
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,885
and that girl who works
at the Dirty Queen.

507
01:05:05,691 --> 01:05:10,170
- The one with the lazy eye?
- I find laziness very attractive.

508
01:05:13,706 --> 01:05:18,354
- I really like you, Claire.
- I really like you too.

509
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:22,274
No, I mean it. You're just like
the coolest person. I Just...

510
01:05:22,275 --> 01:05:26,064
I Just really feel like we match.

511
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:32,484
You know, I'd love the fact that
you support me with the website and...

512
01:05:33,142 --> 01:05:36,545
I just love the fact that
you take me seriously.

513
01:05:36,546 --> 01:05:40,267
It means a lot.
You are great.

514
01:05:40,941 --> 01:05:44,883
- Don't you think I'm going a little bit crazy?
- You're not going crazy.

515
01:05:44,884 --> 01:05:49,599
You are great.
I would do anything for you.

516
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,809
- Really?
- Absolutely.

517
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:57,707
Just... I like you so much.

518
01:06:04,062 --> 01:06:06,449
Hey, I have an idea.

519
01:06:09,018 --> 01:06:11,156
Me too. What's yours?

520
01:06:25,097 --> 01:06:29,954
Let's go to the basement, and find out
what the fucking ghost problem is.

521
01:06:33,645 --> 01:06:35,215
Okay.

522
01:07:30,983 --> 01:07:33,858
That's a good omen.

523
01:07:35,864 --> 01:07:38,716
Turn the recorder on.

524
01:08:23,992 --> 01:08:26,648
What was that?

525
01:08:26,649 --> 01:08:29,319
I tripped.

526
01:08:39,638 --> 01:08:43,258
Sorry.
It's just the lighting.

527
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:47,363
- A spider web.
- Follow me.

528
01:09:09,989 --> 01:09:13,217
I'm starting to think we should
have brought breadcrumbs.

529
01:09:14,177 --> 01:09:17,168
Hang on.

530
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:19,517
Hear something.

531
01:09:27,024 --> 01:09:29,884
It's weird. You're static.

532
01:09:29,885 --> 01:09:34,768
- I heard that too the other night.
- Must be a bad cable.

533
01:09:35,786 --> 01:09:39,059
No, it's her.

534
01:09:50,924 --> 01:09:53,263
This way.

535
01:10:17,994 --> 01:10:21,261
This is it.
This is where they hid her body.

536
01:10:53,063 --> 01:10:55,944
Are you ready?

537
01:11:01,686 --> 01:11:05,812
We wish to speak to the spirit
of Madeline O'Malley.

538
01:11:07,609 --> 01:11:11,175
If you're here with us,
give us a sign.

539
01:11:32,336 --> 01:11:35,183
Make noise if you can hear us.

540
01:11:41,619 --> 01:11:44,912
Why do you stay here, Madeline?

541
01:11:47,163 --> 01:11:50,453
Why did your spirit never rest?

542
01:12:15,676 --> 01:12:18,137
Madeline, give us a sign.

543
01:12:25,881 --> 01:12:29,233
Did you feel that?

544
01:12:34,753 --> 01:12:37,918
It's her.

545
01:12:38,478 --> 01:12:41,790
- That was the wind.
- No, she is with us right now.

546
01:12:48,401 --> 01:12:52,515
Madeline, speak to us.
We wish you no harm.

547
01:12:56,603 --> 01:12:59,596
Why do you stay here?

548
01:13:07,973 --> 01:13:11,061
Why did your spirit never rest?

549
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:26,884
Wait, no. Madeline, we know that you are
here with us right now. Speak to us.

550
01:13:51,831 --> 01:13:54,886
I can hear her.

551
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:02,917
Do you hear the whispering?

552
01:14:13,516 --> 01:14:15,316
Madeline?

553
01:14:26,616 --> 01:14:28,616
Holy shit.

554
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:35,910
What?

555
01:14:41,531 --> 01:14:44,916
She's right behind you.

556
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:54,257
She's coming closer.

557
01:14:58,416 --> 01:14:59,687
Luke!

558
01:15:12,916 --> 01:15:14,417
Luke!

559
01:15:16,472 --> 01:15:18,962
- I gotta get out of here.
- What?

560
01:15:18,963 --> 01:15:21,092
I don't wanna be here anymore.
I don't like this.

561
01:15:21,093 --> 01:15:23,117
What are you talking about?
We just made a physical contact.

562
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:24,358
Why are you freaking out?

563
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:26,919
I just don't wanna be here anymore.
That's it.

564
01:15:27,167 --> 01:15:29,002
Why? Was it different from the
other times that you saw her?

565
01:15:29,003 --> 01:15:32,622
- There were no other times.
- What?

566
01:15:33,523 --> 01:15:37,941
I made it up.
I never saw anything.

567
01:15:38,852 --> 01:15:43,122
I made it all up. I don't want
anything to do with this anymore.

568
01:15:43,123 --> 01:15:46,047
This is just too fucked up.

569
01:15:46,048 --> 01:15:48,978
I gotta go.

570
01:15:48,978 --> 01:15:50,186
Luke!

571
01:15:54,653 --> 01:15:57,789
- Luke, don't go!
- I'm sorry, Claire.

572
01:15:58,105 --> 01:16:01,137
- You can't leave me here.
- I'm really sorry.

573
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:17,256
What am I gonna do now?

574
01:17:02,316 --> 01:17:03,867
Lee?

575
01:17:06,017 --> 01:17:07,716
Lee!

576
01:17:11,417 --> 01:17:12,717
Lee.

577
01:17:13,866 --> 01:17:15,103
Lee! Lee.

578
01:17:15,104 --> 01:17:18,600
Lee, wake up. I need your help.
Help me.

579
01:17:19,117 --> 01:17:20,416
Lee!

580
01:17:25,782 --> 01:17:28,684
What are you doing in my room?

581
01:17:28,685 --> 01:17:31,944
- Get out of here.
- No. No, please. Plaese. Please.

582
01:17:31,945 --> 01:17:35,427
No, I will not help you.
Please go away.

583
01:17:35,428 --> 01:17:38,110
Come on.

584
01:17:38,811 --> 01:17:42,288
Why should I help you?
So you can make fun of me some more?

585
01:17:42,289 --> 01:17:45,464
You know, I believe in what I do.

586
01:17:45,465 --> 01:17:50,440
And I don't believe in wasting my time
on lonely hotel employees and their

587
01:17:50,441 --> 01:17:53,179
insulting ignorance.

588
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:57,577
Lee, I'm sorry, okay?
I should have defended you downstairs

589
01:17:57,578 --> 01:18:02,031
and I made a really big mistake, okay?
but I have a problem. I'm scared, I'm alone,

590
01:18:02,032 --> 01:18:05,917
and Madeline made contact with me,
and I don't know what else to do, okay?

591
01:18:05,918 --> 01:18:08,037
I don't know what else to do!

592
01:18:27,663 --> 01:18:31,219
- Is there anymore vodka over there?
- I'll check.

593
01:18:35,309 --> 01:18:37,736
Here, take this one.

594
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,617
Okay.

595
01:18:46,944 --> 01:18:50,258
Take me to where it happened.

596
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:00,418
Wait here.

597
01:20:33,085 --> 01:20:35,770
Lee! Was it Madeline?
Did you see her?

598
01:20:35,771 --> 01:20:39,354
- Lee, what happened?
- We must get out of this hotel.

599
01:20:39,355 --> 01:20:42,311
You're in great danger.
You can't stay here any longer.

600
01:20:42,312 --> 01:20:44,609
- What?
- I have to go get dressed.

601
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:47,468
Go get your things.
Trust me.

602
01:21:08,418 --> 01:21:09,818
Oh, no.

603
01:21:13,717 --> 01:21:17,055
Lee! I forgot something.
I'll meet you in the lobby.

604
01:21:32,934 --> 01:21:34,429
Sir?

605
01:21:41,168 --> 01:21:43,417
Sir?

606
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:50,617
Sir, I'm sorry that
I'm disturbing you, but...

607
01:21:50,618 --> 01:21:53,618
there has been an emergency and I have
to leave the hotel for a little bit.

608
01:22:00,765 --> 01:22:04,003
Sir, can you hear me in there?

609
01:22:13,718 --> 01:22:17,003
MY DARLING, THIS IS WHERE OUR
LIFE BEGAN. NOW THAT YOU ARE GONE,

610
01:22:17,004 --> 01:22:20,718
THIS IS WHERE I WANT MINE TO END.

611
01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:40,493
Sir?

612
01:23:49,918 --> 01:23:51,117
Holy shit!

613
01:23:51,118 --> 01:23:53,518
- Luke? What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry.

614
01:23:53,519 --> 01:23:55,107
I should have not left you like that.

615
01:23:55,108 --> 01:23:56,518
- Please don't be mad at me.
- No no no, listen.

616
01:23:56,519 --> 01:23:57,893
- We need to get out of here right now.
- No no no, Claire...

617
01:23:57,894 --> 01:24:00,917
- I have to tell you something.
- No! Listen to me, okay?

618
01:24:00,918 --> 01:24:02,262
- Remember that old man upstairs?
- Yeah!

619
01:24:02,263 --> 01:24:05,026
- Yes, so what?
- He's dead. He killed himself. He's dead.

620
01:24:06,123 --> 01:24:09,158
- What?
- Yeah, he's dead.

621
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:12,250
- Did you call the police?
- No, not yet.

622
01:24:12,251 --> 01:24:16,854
Lee... Lee said that it's no safe to be here
anymore, and we need to leave right now.

623
01:24:16,855 --> 01:24:21,413
- And I saw Madeline...
- Okay, wait, wait a second. Hold on.

624
01:24:21,414 --> 01:24:24,581
Come here. Jesus Christ.

625
01:24:25,161 --> 01:24:26,922
Here, sit down.

626
01:24:29,817 --> 01:24:32,906
It's alright.

627
01:24:34,157 --> 01:24:37,718
His face...
There was blood everywhere.

628
01:24:37,719 --> 01:24:39,572
It's okay.

629
01:24:41,373 --> 01:24:45,335
Please, please, please, just get me out of here.
I don't wanna be here anymore. Please.

630
01:24:45,336 --> 01:24:48,510
- Alright. Okay. Come on, let's go.
- Lee, she's still upstairs.

631
01:24:48,511 --> 01:24:51,093
- Where is she?
- I don't know, she's getting her things.

632
01:24:51,094 --> 01:24:53,118
Alright, I'll go get her, and
you just stay put for a second.

633
01:24:53,119 --> 01:24:54,918
Are you gonna be alright
down here for a minute?

634
01:24:54,919 --> 01:24:55,825
Yeah.

635
01:24:55,826 --> 01:24:57,917
It's fine. It's gonna be okay.
Just hold on.

636
01:25:11,618 --> 01:25:13,118
<i>Claire.</i>

637
01:25:20,219 --> 01:25:21,819
<i>Claire.</i>

638
01:25:32,464 --> 01:25:35,991
Lee, is that you?

639
01:26:24,369 --> 01:26:25,819
Lee?

640
01:27:08,419 --> 01:27:09,819
Lee?

641
01:27:15,318 --> 01:27:16,819
Lee?

642
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:23,287
I don't wanna go back down there.

643
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:38,509
Are you down there?

644
01:29:39,770 --> 01:29:43,025
Please, somebody help me!
Luke!

645
01:29:57,290 --> 01:29:58,881
Please!

646
01:29:58,882 --> 01:30:02,593
Somebody help me!
Please!

647
01:30:02,594 --> 01:30:06,898
Please, help me! Please!
Please, no! No, please!

648
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:44,181
Alright, guys, hold her up.
Hold her up.

649
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:51,719
Jesus.

650
01:30:55,269 --> 01:30:57,944
Alright, get her out of here.

651
01:31:09,665 --> 01:31:12,928
I was banging on the door
as hard as I could.

652
01:31:13,746 --> 01:31:17,134
I could hear her screaming.

653
01:31:17,135 --> 01:31:20,752
I was screaming for her
to open up, but she wouldn't.

654
01:31:23,552 --> 01:31:28,565
She called my name, but I wasn't
strong enough to break it down.

655
01:31:33,342 --> 01:31:37,220
This was at the bottom of the stairs.

656
01:31:39,298 --> 01:31:42,326
Alright, listen to me.
I need you to come with us,

657
01:31:42,327 --> 01:31:44,609
and answer some questions
about the gentleman upstairs.

658
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:48,934
And help getting contact with
her family. Can you do that?

659
01:31:48,935 --> 01:31:51,414
- Yeah, I just gotta get my stuff.
- Okay.

660
01:31:51,415 --> 01:31:55,153
You think you can tell the actress to hurry up
when you're in there? We need her too.

661
01:31:55,154 --> 01:31:56,669
Yeah.

662
01:31:57,582 --> 01:31:58,719
Oh, listen...

663
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:01,691
Are you sure you gave me all the names
and numbers of the other guests?

664
01:32:01,692 --> 01:32:03,765
Nobody I might be forgetting?

665
01:32:04,766 --> 01:32:08,078
No, I gave you everything. There was
just the other woman with her kid and...

666
01:32:08,079 --> 01:32:12,581
Ron the owner, but he doesn't get back
from Barbados till tomorrow.

667
01:32:13,849 --> 01:32:16,219
Alright, thanks.

668
01:33:42,369 --> 01:33:45,721
What are you doing in here?

669
01:33:48,221 --> 01:33:51,007
They're looking for you downstairs,
I said I'd find you.

670
01:33:51,008 --> 01:33:55,863
We have to go to the police station
and answer to some more questions.

671
01:34:00,234 --> 01:34:04,727
Did you hear me?
I said we have to go.

672
01:34:11,173 --> 01:34:14,348
You knew this was gonna
happen, didn't you?

673
01:34:16,887 --> 01:34:19,923
You could have done something.

674
01:34:23,097 --> 01:34:27,367
No. There's nothing anyone
could have done.

675
01:34:33,007 --> 01:34:36,265
They're looking for you downstairs.
