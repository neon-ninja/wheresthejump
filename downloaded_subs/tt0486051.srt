00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,189
Oh. Jerk.

3
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,963
Hey.

4
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,197
Do you think you could have parked
any further from the entrance?

5
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,739
Yeah, well, there were still some cars
when l got here. So...

6
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,172
Right.

7
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,803
l thought we were going to get an early start
and stay out of the snow.

8
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,243
What time is it?

9
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,144
lt's a quarter after 3:00.

10
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,547
l'm sorry,
you should have just left without me.

11
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,983
That's what l would have done.

12
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,988
l'm kind of getting kicked
out of my apartment, so...

13
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:23,187
-Okay, well, there's no room.
-Oh, no, no, no.

14
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,992
Why don't you just get the engine started
and put the heat on, okay?

15
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,192
And l can handle this.

16
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,203
-You sure you can...
-Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

17
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,946
Whoa, hang on, hang on.
lt sticks sometimes.

18
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,876
-What's wrong with this thing?
-That's as far up as it goes.

19
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,314
Oh, it's fine. l was two hours late.

20
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,323
Good start.

21
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,555
Well, tell me about it,

22
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,621
l'm supposed to be
sitting on a beach in Cabo.

23
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:36,429
He said we should see other people,
which is original.

24
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:44,903
l'm not. l mean, l'm just not.
l couldn't care less.

25
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:48,105
No, no, it's been about an hour.

26
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,843
Are you kidding? l'm bored to tears.

27
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,283
We're still on the highway
for another five hours.

28
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:59,016
How should l know?
All the highways look exactly alike.

29
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,091
Hey. What?

30
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,257
Oh, somebody is upset.

31
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,927
Who do you think? My ride.

32
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,299
Careful.

33
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,839
Would you get a look at that face, moody?

34
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,174
What?

35
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,682
lf l have to drive, you have to talk to me.

36
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,810
What, l'm the in-flight entertainment?

37
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,514
That's how this ride sharing thing works,
okay?

38
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,283
-Really?
-Division of labor.

39
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,019
-We split everything 50-50.
-Oh, well, l got news for you.

40
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:38,120
l don't get much more entertaining
than when l'm on the phone.

41
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,244
-So, you're from Wilmington, right?
-Yeah.

42
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,409
Where did you go to school?

43
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,309
St. Vitus Academy.

44
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,355
St. Vitus? l never heard of that.

45
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,220
You're acquainted with every school
in the area?

46
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,882
Pretty much, yeah.

47
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,053
Yeah, well, even the Catholic ones?
'Cause that's where l went to school.

48
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,757
St. Vitus Academy for Catholic boys.

49
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,569
We had a class together, you know.

50
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,875
lntro to modern philosophy.

51
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:37,952
What? There was like a million people
in that class. lt was like Woodstock.

52
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,290
You ever see
so many Eastern-religion types?

53
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,891
What's your major?

54
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,957
Eastern Religions.

55
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,098
So, you aren't majoring in philosophy?

56
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,540
No, why?

57
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,276
l don't know, l just assumed that you were...

58
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,280
Oh, yeah, well, try engineering.

59
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,542
l only took philosophy
because l needed a humanities credit

60
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,918
and l heard it was an easy A.

61
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,592
What did you put
for that last question on the final?

62
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,493
Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence?

63
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,895
Yeah, like reincarnation, right?

64
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,833
-No, they're actually not the same thing.
-Damn.

65
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,403
Reincarnation is when you come back
as something different

66
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:29,498
and eternal recurrence is when you live
the same life over and over again.

67
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:34,137
''The eternal hourglass of existence
is turned over and over, and you with it,

68
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,408
''a grain of dust.''

69
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,116
High school and philosophy,

70
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:48,716
that pretty much covers everything,
don't you think?

71
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,161
l guess that concludes
the entertainment portion of today's flight.

72
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:15,311
The next gas station you see,
do me a favor and pull over. l got to pee.

73
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,151
Yeah, okay, l'll keep my eyes peeled.

74
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,618
What?

75
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,856
No, it's that phrase,
keeping your eyes peeled.

76
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,988
l just find it creepy, you know.

77
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,497
Yeah, it is sort of.

78
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,659
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

79
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,860
Speaking of peeling eyeballs,

80
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,872
did you know that's how they do
that corrective eye surgery?

81
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,135
Yeah, they use a laser.

82
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:40,508
Yeah, they do,
but there's also peeling involved.

83
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,047
l saw it on <i>Discovery Health.</i>

84
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,344
You know, if more people knew
about the whole peeling part,

85
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,113
they might think twice
before going under the knife.

86
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,849
lt's a laser, they use a laser.

87
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,852
l'm having corrective eye surgery
over the break.

88
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,828
-Why? Why do you...
-Because l hate wearing my glasses, okay?

89
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,058
But they look so good on you.

90
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,000
How would you know?
l never wear them outside my dorm.

91
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,164
Hey, here's your gas station.

92
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,358
-What?
-l thought you had to pee.

93
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,865
Yeah, but l didn't expect us
to find a bathroom so soon.

94
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:12,199
-My nails aren't dry.
-Oh.

95
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,005
-Well...
-lt's fine, they'll be dry any second.

96
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,633
-lf you want, l can carry you.
-l'll just...

97
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,836
-You're not carrying me.
-No, no, no, trust me.

98
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,811
-l'm good at this, okay? l'm good at this.
-Give me a break.

99
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,142
-What the hell are you...
-Here you go, just...

100
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,306
For Christ's sake!

101
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,680
You're going to be thanking me, okay?
Just wrap your arms around me.

102
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:26,843
-Wait!
-Lift up...

103
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,582
-Oh, my God.
-There we go. Okay, now shut the door.

104
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,048
-This is sick.
-No, no, this is good, right?

105
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,990
This is good.

106
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,590
There you go.

107
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,364
Grab the door. You see that? lt's in there.

108
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,900
Thanks. That's sweet.

109
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,704
Put me down. You can put me down now.

110
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,413
Sir, is there a bathroom?

111
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:03,079
-ls there a bathroom?
-Yeah, it's right through there.

112
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,122
Oh, great.

113
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,890
Come on.

114
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,051
Piece of shit, come on.

115
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,826
Hey!

116
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,233
Hey, l'm locked in here!

117
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,166
Hey!

118
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,080
Hey, can...

119
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,159
Can anybody hear me? l'm locked in!

120
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,532
Hey, l'm locked in!

121
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,435
How could you not hear me?

122
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,733
Christ! Come on.

123
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,977
Hey. Hey, didn't you just hear me
banging in there?

124
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,579
When?

125
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,814
Oh, is that funny to you, me locked in?
You think that's funny?

126
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,253
What are you talking about?
Locked in where?

127
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,383
You're telling me, you didn't just hear me
banging on the door? l could hear you.

128
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,587
Listen, l don't know
what you're talking about.

129
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:38,798
Forget it. lt doesn't even matter.
Let's just get on the road.

130
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,098
Remember, the highway's your best bet.

131
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,833
Don't worry about it, man.
l got it all covered.

132
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,968
-Are we lost or something?
-No, l've done this drive a million times.

133
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,422
-What's that for?
-lt's my half of the gas.

134
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,617
-No, it's fine. lt's fine. No.
-Come on...

135
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,684
What do you mean?
''This is how ride sharing works.

136
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,127
''Division of labor.
We split everything 50-50.''

137
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:09,099
-Come on, take the money.
-l don't take money from friends.

138
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,676
What the hell is this?

139
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,483
-lt's a scenic detour.
-Get back on the highway.

140
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,682
-Look, would you just...
-No, l mean it, get back on the highway.

141
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:06,918
-Calm down.
-You don't know where you're going.

142
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,254
All right, will you chill? lt looks interesting.

143
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,591
No, l won't chill, get back on the highway.
This is not going to happen.

144
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,325
Look, relax, okay? lt's a shortcut.

145
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,925
We'll be back on the highway in no time.

146
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,593
Yeah, well, there's no radio station...

147
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,927
You're not going to get a signal,
we're in a valley.

148
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:53,027
FM radio waves travel in a straight line,
they can't penetrate the big hills. Try AM.

149
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:57,564
Where were you
when l was flunking freshman physics?

150
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,446
So, does your family do
the whole traditional family Christmas?

151
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,716
Yeah.

152
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,085
You?

153
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,457
No, my grandparents are Dutch,

154
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,225
so l was raised on salted liquorice
and <i>Sinterklaas.</i>

155
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,894
How is that different
from regular Santa Claus?

156
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,098
Well, instead of the North Pole,
he lives in Spain.

157
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:33,236
And instead of elves,
he's got this enforcer named Black Pete.

158
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:37,078
So, he's basically like your Santa Claus,
only scarier.

159
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,578
That's charming.

160
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:46,516
So, come on, what's your Christmas like?

161
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,925
Christmas is like me racing
back and forth between Mom and Dad,

162
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:54,363
who split in my freshman year. So...

163
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,594
Two turkey dinners, two trees,

164
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,502
two sets of presents
to return for store credit.

165
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,968
l can normally deal,

166
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:08,843
but this year Mom decided to rent
a condo at the beach, which is like...

167
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,341
Which is like what, two hours away?

168
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:17,217
l don't know, the beach can be
sort of nice in the winter.

169
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,653
Romantic.

170
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,991
You a Rehoboth Beach family
or Stone Harbor?

171
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,229
Stone Harbor.

172
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,828
Yeah, we always went to Rehoboth.

173
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,540
l was just jealous of all my friends

174
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:41,010
who got to spend summers
at the Jersey shore.

175
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,876
Yeah, me, too.

176
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,641
Stone Harbor is the Jersey shore.

177
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:50,981
-Yeah.
-You know that, right?

178
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,524
-No, no, l know where it is.
-You're not from Delaware, are you?

179
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,322
No. lt's complicated.

180
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,023
-Who are you?
-What are you talking about? l am...

181
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,327
-What the hell's going on here?
-Nothing's going on.

182
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,197
Yeah, what the hell's going on here?

183
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,702
-Will you just calm down, okay?
-No, you're freaking me out.

184
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,739
l can explain. lt's...

185
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,239
Well, you explain. l don't get any of this.

186
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,707
Watch out.

187
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,404
Do you have the lights on?
He doesn't even see us.

188
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,707
-Well, how can he not see us?
-Pull over! Let the asshole go by.

189
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,408
Where do you want me to pull over?
There's no shoulder.

190
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,915
l don't know. Slow down! He's not stopping!

191
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,211
Hold on! Hold on!

192
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,982
Come on.

193
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,157
Come on. Please.

194
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,966
Come on.

195
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,244
What are you doing?

196
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,312
Just calling 91 1 . l've been trying to call 91 1 .

197
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,822
-Any luck?
-l can't get a signal.

198
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:43,683
-What about yours?
-l don't have a cell.

199
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,026
How can you not have a cell?

200
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,065
How are you doing?

201
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,832
-You all right?
-l'm fine.

202
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,071
-How about you?
-l don't know. l think l...

203
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,708
l think l hit my head.

204
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:07,274
So what happened to the...

205
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,411
What happened to the guy?

206
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:13,184
l don't know.
He just decided to hit and run, l guess.

207
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,459
Yeah, but...

208
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,021
But where's...

209
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,795
Where's his tire tracks?

210
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,018
Hello!

211
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,593
ls anybody down there?

212
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,829
Anyone?

213
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,880
l guess we go back to the car,
see how bad we're stuck.

214
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,813
All right, why don't l...

215
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,887
Why don't you get in there and steer
and l'll push, okay?

216
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,949
Go ahead, start it up.

217
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,111
Yeah, give it gas.

218
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,121
Come on. Okay, give it more gas.

219
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,054
More gas, more gas!

220
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,222
More gas, more gas!

221
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,367
Okay, okay, stop.

222
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,480
Open up.

223
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,919
Can you pop the lock?

224
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,084
-Come on, it's freezing out here.
-Well, better get used to it, asshole.

225
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,390
What the hell is wrong with you?
What did l do?

226
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,054
You drove us here.

227
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,224
That's what you did.
What the hell did you think you were doing?

228
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,666
l thought l was driving you home.
What are you talking about?

229
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,670
You're not driving me home,
you don't live near my home,

230
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,332
and this piece of shit isn't driving anywhere.

231
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,671
Now, what are we doing here?

232
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,143
-Why did you get off the highway?
-Look, l told you, okay?

233
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,146
-This is a shortcut, all right?
-Oh, come on.

234
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,479
Anyway, you're the one who said
she was so bored driving on the highway.

235
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,018
l was. l was bored.

236
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,314
Well, this used to be called Scenic 606

237
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,856
because there's an amazing view
of the valley out here.

238
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,927
You've never been here before
so don't pretend you knew it's a shortcut,

239
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:39,953
and there's an amazing view of shit
because it's pitch black out.

240
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,828
Okay, so let me get this straight.

241
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,164
You think l intentionally arranged
for us to get stranded out here?

242
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,000
-l don't know!
-Look, it was an accident, God damn it!

243
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,040
You saw the other guy.
You think he was in on it, too, huh?

244
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,199
-Maybe, maybe!
-You're crazy.

245
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,368
-l'm crazy?
-Yes!

246
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,810
You know what?
While you were supposedly unconscious,

247
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,872
l got through to a friend's voicemail
and l'm sure she's called the cops by now.

248
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:02,442
Would you listen to yourself?
What kind of a psycho do you think l am?

249
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,112
Exactly!

250
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:16,890
All right, look, l'm going to head
back to the gas station, okay?

251
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,304
l'm going to go back there for help.

252
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:24,502
You should be fine.
You've got the radio, you've got the heater.

253
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:28,410
But l really think
you should consider coming with me.

254
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,538
Yeah, l bet you do.

255
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,511
All right, fine, whatever.

256
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,813
Look, if you start to feel cold
and you feel a draft

257
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,859
and you want to patch this,
l keep some duct tape in the back.

258
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,723
l bet you do!

259
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,598
<i>The National Weather Service in Harrisburg</i>

260
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,299

265
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,325
Hello! Do you live around here?

266
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,795
We've just had an accident.

267
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:04,562
We could really use some help here.

268
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,407
What the hell?

269
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:22,880
-Hey.
-Jesus!

270
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,012
Whoa, relax, relax. Take it easy. lt's just me.

271
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,284
-Just stay away from me.
-Oh, take it easy, what's wrong?

272
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:31,385
-You, everything and that guy...
-What guy? What guy?

273
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:34,522
l don't know, it was weird. l just saw some
guy who was walking down the road.

274
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,534
-Where'd he go, up here?
-lnto the woods.

275
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,168
All right, well, look,

276
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,608
why don't we just get in the car
and you can tell me all about it?

277
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:48,906
-What are you doing back so soon?
-What?

278
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,413
What about hiking to the gas station?

279
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,347
-lt should have taken you longer than that.
-lt was closed.

280
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,716
l was gonna leave a note,
but l didn't have anything to write with.

281
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,755
Those places are supposed
to stay open 24<i>l</i>7.

282
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,084
Why wasn't it open? Tell me that.

283
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,954
Well, how the hell should l know?
lt was an independent operator.

284
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,858
Look, it's freezing out here.
Let's just get in the car.

285
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:08,922
l'm not getting into the car with you,
you psycho.

286
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:13,367
Fine, suit yourself.
l'm getting in, you're welcome to join me.

287
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,308
God damn it.

288
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,492
God damn it.

289
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,845
Relax, we need to conserve the battery,
okay?

290
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,593
lt's not right.

291
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,425
The clock is not right.

292
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,863
lt's not. lt should say...

293
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,099
Well, my watch stopped, that's great.

294
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,936
Your head is bleeding.

295
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:26,636
Your head is bleeding by your ear.

296
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,272
lt's nothing.

297
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,645
Doesn't look like nothing. lt's a lot of blood.

298
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:36,176
Well, scalp wounds bleed a lot, you know?
Head wounds in general.

299
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,620
That's why, if you're ever in a bar fight,
what you should do is pick up a beer bottle

300
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,353
and smash the other guy
across the bridge of the nose

301
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,726
'cause it'll make his eyes
fill with blood and snot,

302
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:50,130
and it'll buy you time to get away, so...

303
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,533
That's really useful.

304
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,506
Where are you from?

305
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,240
A place called Glens Falls.

306
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,376
-That's not in Delaware.
-Nope.

307
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,047
-lt's like in the complete opposite direction.
-Yep.

308
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,592
-lt's like 10 minutes from school.
-Okay, all right. So l lied. Okay, so...

309
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,423
-Why? Why would you lie?
-l don't know.

310
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,157
l mean, you seem like a cool girl, you know.

311
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:27,000
And l don't have a line, or a game
or whatever it's called.

312
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:33,034
So, when l saw a chance to get you alone
for six uninterrupted hours, l took it.

313
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,446
How'd you know where l lived?

314
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,009
l asked around.

315
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,085
Yeah, so you knew l was from Delaware,

316
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:51,953
but how did you know
l needed a ride home? l mean...

317
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,293
l always fly. How could you possibly know

318
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,301
that for the first time in my college career
l was going Greyhound?

319
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:38,935
So excuse me
for attempting a romantic gesture.

320
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,776
Romantic? What the...
Come on, try stalkerish.

321
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,442
Yeah, well, not if things
had worked out between us.

322
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:50,112
l mean, l would have told you
everything eventually.

323
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,816
lt would just be
this sweet, funny story we'd have.

324
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,289
We?

325
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,919
Okay, all right,
you've made your point, all right?

326
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:02,125
l'm a creep who gets off on
chauffeuring women under false pretenses.

327
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,668
l got it, all right? Can we just drop this?

328
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,031
Yeah.

329
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,630
Look, l'm starving, okay?
l'm gonna get the groceries from the trunk.

330
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,108
Can you...

331
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,946
-What?
-Oh, shit, l think l left it in the parking lot.

332
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,040
-What?
-l'm sorry, it was an accident.

333
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:25,145
-You have so much crap in your car...
-l just spent 60 bucks on those groceries.

334
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:29,717
l bought all that gourmet crap that you like,
the Saint-André cheese,

335
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:33,820
the Carr's crackers,
those stupid little French pickles.

336
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,196
-Cornichons?
-Cornichons.

337
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,867
l love cornichons.

338
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,302
l know.

339
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:59,155
l think l remember losing a candy bar
down the seat cushion the other day.

340
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,851
Let me just... Oh, God, l'm starving.

341
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,929
What? What is it? What is it?

342
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,092
What?

343
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,094
lt's a candy bar.

344
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,932
You're an asshole.

345
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,700
-Give me these.
-Get off. Let go!

346
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,710
-All right, give me these, God damn it.
-Let go!

347
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,109
l need these.

348
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,840
You just ask.

349
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,580
l can't believe you left all the food
in that parking lot.

350
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,179
Oh, my God,
l will write you a check for 60 bucks

351
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,849
if it'll make you get off my case.

352
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,894
Let's just eat, all right?

353
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,724
You're killing me.

354
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:48,128
-Story of my life, never fails.
-What?

355
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,402
You, girls, women.

356
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,035
-l mean you seem cool at first...
-What are you talking about?

357
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:57,569
You should all come with a warning
like car mirrors.

358
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:00,947
Objects in belly shirts
are flakier than they appear.

359
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,612
You want to talk about flaky,
'cause l'll go there.

360
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,383
How about guys who pretend to be
from Delaware to meet girls?

361
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,391
Okay, how about we just stop talking
altogether, huh?

362
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,723
-That's perfect.
-All right, great, great.

363
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:14,561
That's perfect, 'cause now l'm not some
Nietzsche-spouting girl of your dreams,

364
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,260
suddenly l'm not worth knowing, right?

365
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,849
Well?

366
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,152
Gas.

367
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:39,816
Shit.

368
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,189
Yeah, the fuel tank must have cracked
in the accident.

369
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,192
What do you think?

370
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,800
You got a welding rig
in all that shit of yours?

371
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,532
Even if you did, it wouldn't matter.
We're out of gas.

372
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,834
We still have a battery.

373
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,001
We got no engine.

374
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,806
Okay? We got no heat.

375
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,485
All right.

376
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,781
Hold on a sec.

377
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:22,296
Layers. lt's the only way
we're going to make it to sunup.

378
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:27,528
So start layering up,
put on everything you brought, okay?

379
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,333
Well, l didn't bring anything.

380
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,341
-Oh, Jesus.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right.

381
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,469
l'm just so ill prepared
for us crashing into a snowdrift.

382
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,137
How could you not bring anything?

383
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:39,307
Because l have everything l need
in Delaware.

384
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,684
All right.

385
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:11,945
-What's the matter?
-lt's freezing. l can't feel my toes.

386
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,744
Yeah, me neither.

387
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,384
You know, there is a better way
for two people to conserve body heat.

388
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,121
Oh, dream on.

389
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,862
Whatever.

390
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,070
God.

391
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,612
-What?
-l got to pee.

392
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,580
-All right.
-Oh, sorry.

393
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,648
Why didn't you go
when we were outside before?

394
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,779
Because it's freezing out.

395
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,756
lt's like an arctic air mass out of Canada.

396
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,122
Yeah, well, it's still freezing out.

397
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,663
Yeah, well, l really got to go.
Just promise not to look.

398
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,118
Oh, my God!

399
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,629
Did you see? Did you see?
They were right here.

400
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,824
-Who? Who?
-These people just waltzed right past me.

401
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:12,198
Why didn't you stop them?
Jesus, where'd they go?

402
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,793
-Where'd they go?
-That way. They went...

403
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,862
Well, come on, let's...

404
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,909
Where did they go?

405
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:33,188
They're there, they're there, come on.

406
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:37,193
Hey! Wait! Hello!

407
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,752
There they are. Hello, wait!

408
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:52,103
Come on. Wait, hold on, give me a sec.

409
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:53,403
l guess it's... lt's my back.

410
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,206
-We should just go back to the car.
-No.

411
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:57,543
-No, we should just go back to the car.
-No, we should keep going.

412
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,448
Listen to me. Listen, he looked right at me.

413
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,781
Why wouldn't he stop?
Something's not right.

414
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:06,084
Look, maybe these guys can help us, okay?

415
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:13,062
Okay, you go back to the car
and l'll meet you there.

416
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,957
This is insane.

417
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:23,577
Wait. Wait! Wait! Just, please wait!

418
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,755
Wait! Just wait!

419
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:30,090
Please, Officer, please don't...

420
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,394
Wait!

421
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,397
Don't put me in the river.

422
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,437
Who did this to you?

423
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,496
-l can't hear what you're saying.
-Please, Officer, please.

424
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:46,098
-lt's okay, it's okay.
-Don't put me in the river.

425
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:49,009
-lt's okay. Stop, please stop, it's okay.
-Don't put me in the river.

426
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,686
What happened?

427
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,456
Are you all right?

428
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,157
Are you all right?

429
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,867
l didn't see anyone.
There's nobody up there.

430
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,904
There's nobody up there. Look. Look at me.
Are you all right? What happened?

431
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:53,568
There was this guy, l saw him walking
and there was something with his face.

432
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:56,077
l don't wanna talk. l can't talk.

433
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,171
Oh, Jesus, what happened?

434
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,012
l just went to touch him.

435
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:06,749
Okay.

436
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,891
Come on.

437
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,726
Where'd you get that?

438
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,457
Oh, there's a...

439
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:51,557
There's the ruins of an old house
or something up on the hill.

440
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:57,396
You know, we can use it
to patch the window.

441
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:02,410
Keep the air out better than that.
You got the duct tape?

442
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:06,415
Here.

443
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,252
Okay.

444
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:18,988
Here.

445
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,294
That should stick.

446
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:33,006
-Okay, l'm gonna get in the back.
-Wait.

447
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:55,362
You awake?

448
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,633
l don't want to sleep.

449
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,603
Why?

450
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:08,110
l'm just afraid l won't wake up, you know.

451
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:14,484
That's what they say happens
when you freeze to death.

452
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:17,349
lt's just like going to sleep.

453
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,389
Yeah, well, there's worse ways to go.

454
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:27,292
-Oh, my God, who is it?
-ls everything all right in there?

455
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,525
-lt's a cop, it's a cop.
-What?

456
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,897
-Oh, thank God. Thank God.
-Officer, Officer...

457
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:33,469
You don't know how glad we are to see you.

458
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:34,902
...you won't believe
what's been happening up here.

459
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,302
You don't know
how happy we are to see you.

460
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:37,635
Someone ran us off the road...

461
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,733
There's no parking here.

462
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,472
No, no, we're not...

463
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,877
What are you talking about?
Didn't you hear what she said?

464
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,211
-Somebody ran us off the road.
-Someone ran us off the road.

465
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,217
Of course, l might be willing
to let you off with a warning this time,

466
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,686
if we can come to some sort of arrangement.

467
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:58,152
What are you talking about, sir? We...

468
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:00,492
lt's a shakedown. lt's a shakedown.

469
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,725
He's probably partners with the guy
who ran us off the road.

470
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,427
Oh, Jesus,
you think this whole thing was a scam?

471
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:07,400
That son of a bitch could have killed us.

472
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:11,372
How much cash do you have on you?
Seriously, how much?

473
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,342
Oh, l can't believe this.

474
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,740
Here.

475
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:24,878
l got 20, 30, 40, 35... l got 40 bucks.

476
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,286
-Okay.
-l'll take care of...

477
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,291
No, come on, come on. Please.

478
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:32,692
How many speeding tickets
have you sweet-talked your way out of?

479
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,798
This is all we have.

480
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,595
Sir?

481
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,468
Some weather we're having.

482
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,131
Yeah, it sure is.

483
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,372
So, what do you say?
How about a little Christmas spirit here?

484
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:52,313
You know, this is one bad stretch of road.

485
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,713
Yeah.

486
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:56,548
All kinds of trouble going on up here.

487
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:59,282
Kids drag racing,

488
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,453
niggers hauling booze across state lines.

489
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:09,555
Lady drivers breaking down,
no one ever hears from them again.

490
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:16,732
We just want to get out of here,
so if you could just...

491
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:20,243
Let me tell you,
l've seen a lot of fatalities on this road.

492
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,744
You're lucky l came along when l did.

493
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:29,478
Yeah.

494
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,252
So why don't we get in my car?

495
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:34,483
l'm not getting in your car.

496
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:42,029
l think maybe l just...
l just want to go... l'll go back to my...

497
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:44,259
You're not going anywhere!

498
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:59,948
-Get in the damn patrol car.
-Please, just let us go.

499
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:01,643
Hurry up, we've got an audience.

500
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:03,845
We didn't do anything, just...

501
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,320
Please, just let us go.
We won't tell anybody.

502
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,051
lf you just...
We've done nothing wrong, we...

503
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:12,526
Sir, we got stranded here. Don't do this.

504
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:17,393
Get away from her, you bastard!

505
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,868
Oh, jeez, your fingers are stuck.

506
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,709
Okay, you need to breathe.
This is really gonna hurt, okay? Hold on.

507
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:32,975
-You ready?
-Okay.

508
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,516
-Just breathe.
-Okay.

509
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:38,685
Good, that's really good, that's really good.
Well done.

510
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,352
How bad?

511
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:45,053
You got frostbite, second and third degree.

512
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,995
-How do you know?
-Ski camp.

513
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:49,361
Okay.

514
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,134
Okay.

515
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:57,472
Oh, thanks,
but l'm not really in the mood anymore.

516
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:59,041
We have to re-warm your hands, okay?

517
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:02,977
We got to get the circulation going again.
You could lose your fingers.

518
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:07,208
lt's okay. Okay.

519
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,490
What just happened to us out there?

520
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:18,618
l don't know. You were there.

521
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:22,323
l know, but where did he go?
lt's like, who was he?

522
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:26,425
One minute he's there and then he's gone.
lt's like he was a...

523
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:28,095
A ghost.

524
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,399
No.

525
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:34,837
How do you make it stop?

526
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:39,109
l don't know.
They don't cover this in Philosophy 101 .

527
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,484
lt's okay.

528
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,626
lt's warm.

529
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:03,430
Oh, God!

530
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:07,108
l can feel your stomach rumbling.

531
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:11,113
Oh, God, l'd give anything
for some of those Carr's crackers.

532
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,706
Yeah, me, too.

533
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:20,483
What else did you have in that grocery bag?

534
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:22,184
You don't want to know.

535
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:26,695
l do. l really just...
Oh, just talk to me... l just need to...

536
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:33,133
Okay, l got duck liver pâté with truffles,

537
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:39,841
and l got some olives, the normal kind
and the little black shriveled...

538
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,173
-The shriveled ones.
-Yeah, the little ones with...

539
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:43,872
l got some white wine

540
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:49,316
and then for dessert, l got anisette biscotti

541
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:52,048
and a thermos of espresso.

542
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:58,051
That's pretty much the exact meal
l'd order for my last day on Earth.

543
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:01,156
-Yeah.
-You knew that, anyway.

544
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,165
Weirdo.

545
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:08,068
l'll have to get a restraining order
against you if we ever get out.

546
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,844
-l just want to get through this.
-Okay, come on.

547
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:19,704
lt can't be too much longer till dawn.

548
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,616
There's bound to be someone
who's gonna come by, by then.

549
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,621
Somebody will come by, you know.
Snowplough or something.

550
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:33,359
-How are your hands?
-They're starting to burn.

551
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,125
-Oh, that's good.
-Yeah.

552
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,893
That's really good,
that means the circulation's coming back.

553
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:41,698
That's great.
But, l mean, they're really starting to burn.

554
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,536
-l got some Tylenol.
-Yeah?

555
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,735
-Let go, l got some Tylenol.
-Okay.

556
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,150
lt's freezing.

557
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:17,805
Wait a second,
l think l know who those guys are.

558
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,465
-Listen.
-What?

559
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:23,672
''First to arrive at the scene
were Roman Catholic priests

560
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,010
''from St. Christopher's Home
for Retired Clergy.''

561
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,242
Priests?

562
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:30,309
''Hearing the crash on nearby Route 606,

563
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:35,687

566
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:52,599
That's from December 23, 1953.

567
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:56,037
We need to take turns keeping watch.

568
00:56:56,146 --> 00:57:00,674
Okay, l'll go first, you get some sleep.

569
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:29,595
Oh, my God. Hey. Hey.

570
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:39,635
Wake up. Hey, come on. Come on, wake up!

571
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,599
Oh, thank God.

572
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:08,491
Oh, God!

573
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,650
l think... l think he's gone.

574
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:38,989
What if he comes back?
What if he comes back?

575
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:45,329
We just have to stay in here
until morning, okay?

576
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:49,865
Just stay here until morning, okay?
We'll be safe in here, yeah.

577
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:12,560
So, what happened to the guy
you were supposed to go to Cabo with?

578
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:14,823
What?

579
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:18,623
l heard you talking about it on the phone.

580
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:21,568
-Did you?
-l was sitting here, remember?

581
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:25,372
So, what happened?

582
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:31,044
l blew it.

583
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:39,677
lt wasn't his fault, you know,
he was very sweet.

584
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:44,551
lnto me, a little too into me.

585
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:50,024
l just couldn't stand the idea
of spending all that time alone with him,

586
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,896
or with anyone.

587
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:02,439
l feel so stuck, you know,
in this role of being ''difficult''

588
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:06,709
and l don't know how to shake it off.

589
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:14,254
l'm getting real good at being on my own.

590
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,955
Well, for what it's worth,

591
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,730
l don't think you're that difficult.

592
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:31,240
Actually, maybe you're a little difficult.

593
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:40,879
l'm going to get you some Tylenol, okay?

594
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:50,992
What the hell is this?

595
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:54,320
ls this blood?

596
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,728
Have you been peeing blood?

597
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:03,099
How badly were you hurt in the crash?

598
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:06,269
lt's no big deal.

599
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:09,140
lf it doesn't kill you,
it makes you stronger, right?

600
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:10,837
How long have you known?

601
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:13,177
Since l started walking back
to the gas station.

602
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:14,749
God.

603
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:17,308
You were right, l didn't make it very far.

604
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:21,413
l started spitting out blood
and l turned around and came back.

605
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,151
Why didn't you tell me?

606
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:25,659
l didn't want to scare you, okay?

607
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,496
Jesus Christ.

608
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,661
l'm going to have to get you some help.

609
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:35,538
l'm going to...
l'm going to hike back to the gas station.

610
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,665
l'm going to...
l'm going to hike back to the gas station.

611
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:41,869
Oh, yeah, how far do you think you'll get
before you run into him?

612
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:51,218
l need a landline. l need a landline.

613
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:55,051
l need a landline, l got an idea.

614
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:58,615
-What are you looking at?
-A telephone pole.

615
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:04,155
You know, there's a junction box at the top,
and l've seen it, you can test the lines.

616
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:07,202
That one. That one. You see that one?

617
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:12,172
You have a phone. l saw you have a...

618
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:16,507
Okay, l can jack into it, okay?

619
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,309
And l can try and call for help.

620
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,976
l can do this.

621
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:25,646
-You're forgetting about one thing.
-What?

622
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,489
lt's that song.

623
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:40,160
You turn the radio on
and you listen out for that one song.

624
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:41,897
lt comes on just before he shows up.

625
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:44,234
You gotta listen and when you hear it,

626
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:50,142
you just yell and you honk the horn,
and l can hear you, and l can make it back.

627
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:55,576
-l can make it back.
-Yeah.

628
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:58,247
Okay.

629
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,589
-l've been thinking.
-What about?

630
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:09,595
-Eternal recurrence.
-Oh, yeah?

631
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:12,759
-Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
-What wouldn't?

632
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:18,800
Repeating this life. Over and over.

633
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:23,144
Exactly the same each time.

634
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,343
Even the last 24 hours?

635
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,418
Yeah.

636
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:39,585
l'd do it different.

637
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:55,037
You know what l'd do different?

638
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:03,948
Next time, l'd just walk up to you after class
and say hi.

639
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:09,856
You should.

640
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:14,226
Definitely do that.

641
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:30,305
Wait.

642
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,714
l'll be right back.

643
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,118
<i>91 1 emergency response.</i>

644
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:07,855
-Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi, we need help.
<i>-Yeah, we have a really bad connection...</i>

645
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:12,060
We're on Highway 606. Highway 606.

646
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:15,626
-Please hurry, my friend's hurt and he's...
<i>-Can you repeat your...</i>

647
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:18,401
Hello?

01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:22,827
l think l got through. l think l got through.

649
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:26,636
l don't know if she heard everything.

650
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:30,406
l got through. Yeah, l think l got...

651
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,207
Hey.

652
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:35,374
Hey, come on, wake up,
l think l got through.

653
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:38,986
Hey.

654
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:43,048
Hey, come on. Come on now.

655
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:47,094
Come on, don't do this to me. l got through!

656
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:50,996
Come on, wake up!
l got through! l got through!

657
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:13,381
You knew l was coming back.

658
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:17,722
l told you l was coming back.

659
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,656
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

660
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:33,093
Oh, God, come on. Come on.

661
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:03,164
-Dispatch, can you come in?
<i>-Go ahead.</i>

662
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:07,066
Yeah, l'm at the site of
that reported accident on Route 606.

663
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:08,466
One of them didn't make it.

664
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:11,199
l'm taking the other directly
to the trauma unit in Hadleyville.

665
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:12,967
<i>-Copy that.</i>
-Copy that.

666
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:47,039
There's been some pretty bad accidents
on this road over the years.

667
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:49,600
<i>Started back in the '50s.</i>

668
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:53,203
<i>Supposed to be a bad cop,</i>
<i>used to stop people here.</i>

669
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:56,376
<i>And that was the last you'd see of them.</i>

670
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:59,909
<i>One night, the cop was drunk,</i>
<i>ran some kids off the road.</i>

671
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:04,220
<i>Cop went over the cliff, burned to death.</i>
<i>Kids died, too.</i>

672
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:10,961
Not long after that, a family from
New York City was found froze to death.

673
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,796
Froze to death in their car.
Fire department had to hose them down

674
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:17,133
with hot water for two hours
just to thaw them out.

675
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:20,697
Every year, around the holidays,
seems to be an accident.

676
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:30,214
-What about the priests?
-Winter, '61 .

677
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:35,555
<i>They were all found froze to death</i>
<i>in their beds.</i>

678
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:54,674
Wow, who the hell
is that driving in this mess?

679
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:57,142
Oh, that must be Tom McClintock.

680
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:59,577
-Hey, Tom.
-lt's not Tom.

681
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,908
What the hell is he doing? Oh, my God!

682
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:30,707
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

683
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:37,877
Honey, you're going to be okay.

684
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:45,523
You stay here.

685
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:51,264
l'm going to see about the other guy.

686
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:04,911
Don't move.

687
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,925
Oh, my...

688
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:03,293
-Hang on, Officer. Hang on.
-What are you doing? Don't go down there.

689
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:10,607
-You hang on!
-Sir, don't go down there.

690
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:13,477
Can't move. Can't move!

691
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,574
-We got to help him.
-lt doesn't matter, he's already dead.

692
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:19,916
Stop it. Listen, l need to help him. All right?

693
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:37,831
-Who are they?
-lt's the priests.

694
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:41,170
What are you waiting for,
a letter from the bishop?

695
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,173
Hurry up. l smell gas.

696
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:57,621
What are you doing?

697
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:01,526
Where are you going?

698
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:05,898
You have no right to sit in judgment of me!

699
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:07,992
Whatever you think you saw...

700
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:10,333
lt was all lawfully done!

701
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:19,078
Oh, please, for the love of Christ,
have mercy on a poor sinner.

702
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:22,241
You bastard! No.

703
01:20:24,686 --> 01:20:27,052
You think you're getting rid of me?

704
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:29,817
You're never going to get rid of me.

705
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,102
Come on.

706
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:34,914
Come on. Come on.

707
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:45,758
Get away from her, you bastard!

708
01:21:56,444 --> 01:22:01,108
Oh! No!

709
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:05,108
Oh, just please stop.

710
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:42,680
l would have told you everything eventually.

711
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,019
l know.

712
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:48,853
lt'll be okay.

713
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,065
lt would just be
this sweet, funny story we'd have.
