00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:48,381
{y:i}It is said that over 1 50 years ago...

3
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,092
{y:i}...in the town of Darkness Falls...

4
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:55,930
{y:i}...Matilda Dickson
{y:i}was adored by all the children.

5
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:01,144
{y:i}Whenever one of them lost a tooth,
{y:i}they would bring it to her...

6
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,856
{y:i}...in exchange for a gold coin...

7
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:09,694
{y:i}...earning her the name
{y:i}''The Tooth Fairy. ''

8
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:14,449
{y:i}But fate was not kind to Matilda.

9
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:20,330
{y:i}One night, fire tore through
{y:i}her home on Lighthouse Point...

10
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:24,292
{y:i}...leaving her face horribly scarred.

11
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:31,549
{y:i}Matilda's burned flesh was so sensitive
{y:i}to light, she could only go out at night...

12
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:35,387
{y:i}...always wearing a porcelain mask...

13
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:39,557
{y:i}...so no one could
{y:i}ever look upon her face.

14
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:44,646
{y:i}One day, two children
{y:i}didn't come home.

15
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:49,901
{y:i}The townspeople blamed Matilda.
{y:i}They hanged her...

16
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:55,532
{y:i}...tearing off her mask, exposing
{y:i}her hideous face to the light.

17
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,869
{y:i}And with her dying breath...

18
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,499
{y:i}...Matilda laid a curse
{y:i}upon Darkness Falls.

19
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:10,964
{y:i}The next morning, the two children
{y:i}were found, safe and sound.

20
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:15,844
{y:i}The town buried their secret
{y:i}along with Matilda's body.

21
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,933
{y:i}Since then, there are some
{y:i}who believe that Matilda visits...

22
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,814
{y:i}...the children of Darkness Falls
{y:i}on the night they lose their last tooth...

23
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:32,444
{y:i}...seeking her vengeance on any
{y:i}who lay their eyes upon her face...

24
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,280
{y:i}...fulfilling her curse:

25
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,993
{y:i}''What I took before in kindness...

26
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,581
{y:i}...I will take forever in revenge. ''

27
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,424
You're going to ask Caitlin
to the dance tomorrow, right?

28
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:41,221
You'll do great. l love you.

29
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,397
Now, you get some sleep.

30
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,942
Good night.

31
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,002
Boo!

32
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,466
-That was stupid, Cat.
-Wuss.

33
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,429
You hear Amber said ''asshole''
to Miss Alison in third period?

34
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,390
She got detention for a week.

35
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,687
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

36
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,731
Okay.

37
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:19,235
A bunch of us are going swimming
at the quarry. You want to come?

38
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,574
No. l've gotta get up early for practice.

39
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,912
-l can't believe you still have this.
-Of course.

40
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,956
-Kindergarten, right?
-Right.

41
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,839
Are you sure
you don't want to come?

42
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,593
You're bleeding. Here.

43
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,304
lt's just my tooth.

44
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,267
-ls this the last one?
-Yeah.

45
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,812
This one's special.

46
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,898
Your last baby tooth.

47
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,068
Means you're not a baby anymore.

48
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,700
Okay. Well, l gotta go.

49
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,953
-Cat?
-Yeah?

50
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,791
There's this school dance
on Saturday night...

51
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:21,089
...and it's, like, one of those
boy-girl dances.

52
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,135
And boys ask girls, so--

53
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,804
l already told my mom
you'd be by at 7.

54
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,098
And she can drive us.

55
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:45,864
-So Saturday at 7, right?
-Okay.

56
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:56,082
First time shouldn't taste like blood.
lt should be sweet.

57
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,971
Remember, when the tooth fairy
comes, don't peek.

58
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,983
Kyle?

59
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:31,214
-l saw her. l saw her.
-Kyle! What are you talking about?

60
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,882
l peeked.

61
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,428
Kyle, look at me.

62
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:41,516
-There is no one in this house but us.
-You're wrong.

63
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,103
You're wrong.

64
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:50,567
-l'll go take a look. Okay, Kyle?
-You can't go. Please, Mom.

65
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,403
Please stay in the light, Mom.

66
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,574
Please stay in the light.
Please stay in the light.

67
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:01,202
Please stay in the light.
Oh, please, God.

68
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,135
See, Kyle?
There's nothing to be afraid of.

69
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,157
Mom.

70
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:08,204
There's no next of kin.
The state will look after him.

71
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,707
-Larry!
-Caitlin! What happened?

72
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,460
She was already dead
when we got here.

73
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:18,131
l heard he was having some
problems, but Jesus Christ.

74
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,801
Looks like his mom
put up a bit of a struggle.

75
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,887
Okay.

76
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,181
Kyle?

77
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,060
Kyle, this is Dr. Jenkins.

78
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,812
l want you to go with her.

79
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,823
Caitlin?

80
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,699
Caitlin?

81
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,993
-Caitlin.
-Sorry.

82
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:52,832
As l was saying, noctiphobia
is very common among his age group.

83
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:57,796
Now, we've run one CAT scan
and two MRls at your behest...

84
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,632
...and the conclusions
all say the same thing.

85
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,760
There's nothing wrong with your brother.

86
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:08,056
My brother hasn't slept more
than 1 0 minutes at a time...

87
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:12,852
...for the last three weeks. You go tell
him there's nothing wrong with him.

88
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:18,024
We've run every test possible.
There's nothing more we can do.

89
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,197
What happened?

90
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:28,868
He was asleep. l just closed the blinds.
l didn't think that....

91
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:35,208
l saw her. l saw her.
lt can't be dark.

92
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,627
lt's okay, Michael.

93
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,934
l won't let them shut off
the lights, okay? l promise.

94
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:58,023
lt'll be okay.
lt's okay, Michael.

95
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,387
{y:i}Hello?

96
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:15,850
Hi. ls this Kyle Walsh's number?
This is Caitlin Greene.

97
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,519
That's not funny.

98
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,022
Kyle. Hey, it's Cat.

99
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,442
{y:i}You asked me to the dance
{y:i}but never took me.

100
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:28,196
-Caitlin?
-"Yeah. Hey, you are..."

101
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,740
{y:i}...hard to track down.

102
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:35,245
l know it's been forever.

103
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,540
l'm sorry. Where are my manners?
How are you?

104
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,875
Fine.

105
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:46,047
-What do you want?
-Right. Right.

106
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,385
lt's my brother, Michael.

107
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:54,597
He's in the hospital, and he....

108
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:59,477
He's really scaring me. He won't sleep,
not even 1 0 minutes at a time...

109
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,314
{y:i}...and now he won't let us
{y:i}shut off any of the lights.

110
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,735
Doctors say he has something
called noctiphobia or....

111
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,903
Night terrors.

112
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,032
Right.

113
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,577
l remembered that's what they
said you had when your--

114
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,829
{y:i}When your mother was killed.

115
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:23,126
Anyway, l just thought maybe you
could tell me how you got over it.

116
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,425
l didn't.

117
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,152
You must be Michael.

118
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:35,323
lt's okay, man.
l'm not gonna hurt you.

119
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:39,828
l just wanna talk a little.
My name's Kyle.

120
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:45,125
Your sister says you're afraid
of the dark. Makes it tough to sleep.

121
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,585
You get a lot of sleep?

122
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,715
Me neither.

123
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,677
Well, this was a bad idea.

124
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:10,025
Caitlin says that when you grow up,
you're not afraid of the dark anymore.

125
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,453
-ls that true?
-Yes.

126
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,079
Why not?

127
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:29,210
Because you grow up and you realize
that there's nothing to be afraid of.

128
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,257
Then why are you still afraid?

129
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,595
Well, sometimes old habits die hard.

130
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:43,308
You wanna see something?
This flashlight, it's my peace of mind.

131
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,113
She won't come in the light.

132
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:02,285
-Who?
-You know who.

133
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:07,582
No. l don't know who.

134
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,043
Yes, you do.

135
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:14,339
You've seen her too.

136
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:24,099
Why would you say
something like that, Michael?

137
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,060
Because it's the truth.

138
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:33,983
Sometimes l think of
turning off all the lights...

139
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,486
...and letting her come and take me.

140
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:42,617
Sometimes l think that would be
easier than being so scared.

141
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,120
Did you ever think that?

142
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,258
She's gonna kill me, you know.

143
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:03,555
No one's gonna kill you, Michael.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

144
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,558
Your sister won't let it.

145
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,227
My sister can't stop her.

146
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,150
No one can stop her.

147
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,318
Kyle?

148
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:28,747
-l can't believe you came.
-That makes two of us.

149
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,791
So....

150
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:38,423
-So, what do you think? ls he--?
-What do the doctors say?

151
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:43,762
That he's a kid, he's just afraid
of the dark, he's confused.

152
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:47,682
Growing up here will do that to you.

153
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,893
Listen....

154
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,859
l hate to ask you this, but...

155
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:03,365
...when your mother died,
what really happened to you?

156
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,243
Cat, it's--

157
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,039
-Because it seems like it's the same--
-No.

158
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:16,211
-But the things he says--
-They're just things.

159
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,590
But these....

160
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,729
-Kyle?
-Did Michael just lose a tooth?

161
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,857
Yes, his last one.

162
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,276
But....

163
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:44,406
Come on, Kyle. You don't
still believe that, do you?

164
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:49,577
l mean, we all grew up with it,
but it was just a story to scare us.

165
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,838
l'm sorry, Caitlin.

166
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,423
This was a mistake.

167
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,763
Look, will you just--?
Wait a minute, please.

168
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,602
l don't think l know how
to help Michael.

169
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,272
Hey, Catey.

170
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:19,482
Kyle?

171
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,319
Larry.

172
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:27,115
You came. That's terrific.

173
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:31,286
lt's great to see you, buddy.
All right.

174
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,955
l came straight from work.

175
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:39,044
So is there any reason
for us to panic, or what?

176
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,504
No, no.

177
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:45,800
Good. Good.
Well, that's what l keep telling Catey.

178
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:49,929
We have some of the best doctors
in the state in this hospital.

179
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:53,350
How about l take you two guys
out to dinner tonight?

180
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:57,062
What do you say? We can
celebrate the prodigal's return.

181
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:00,565
l think l'm just gonna
stay here with Michael.

182
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:03,485
Okay. Yeah.
Well, good night, honey.

183
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,863
Caitlin?

184
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,367
l'm sorry.

185
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,874
Well, Kyle, what do you feel like doing?

186
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,835
l feel like l've been here
too long already.

187
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:24,422
-Wait. We could go to The lnn, right?
-l don't drink.

188
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:27,801
Come on, Kyle. l haven't
seen you in 1 2 years, man.

189
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,762
One drink's not gonna
kill anybody, right?

190
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,231
Where's Kyle?

191
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,484
He left.

192
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:48,071
ls he coming back?

193
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:49,948
l don't know.

194
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:12,178
-Walsh, what's going on, man?
-Relax, buddy.

195
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:16,599
You'll survive one drink, right?
Beer okay?

196
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:20,687
-Can't.
-Oh, Jesus.

197
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,777
-Long time no see, Walsh.
-Hey, Dave. Two drafts.

198
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:33,533
-Fleishman, who's your date?
-Remember Kyle? Thank you.

199
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:38,288
-Kyle, as in Kyle Walsh.
-That's right, Ray.

200
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:41,541
That's him in the flesh.
Thank you, Dave.

201
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:52,093
Where you going, man? Sit down.
l bought you a beer.

202
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,889
l figured you'd like this one.
lt's a light.

203
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,602
You should have told me
you were coming back.

204
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:05,190
-l didn't know you'd still be here.
-You left a lot of shit behind.

205
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:11,821
-What's wrong?
-That's the freak who killed his mother.

206
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:16,409
So come on, man.
What you been doing with yourself?

207
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:24,918
-l'm in the gaming industry.
-Larry Fleishman, attorney at law.

208
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:26,670
You're an attorney?

209
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:31,591
You stole more candy than anyone
in the history of stealing.

210
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:34,344
That's why l'm a defense attorney.

211
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:42,769
So come on, Kyle, give.
What are you really doing back here?

212
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,315
Jesus!

213
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,735
l came to see if l could help Michael.

214
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:53,196
You don't look like
you can help anybody.

215
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:57,701
Wanna tell me how you got over it?
You did get over it, right?

216
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:01,246
She's got a whole new life now.

217
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,581
Caitlin.

218
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,917
This whole thing with Mikey....

219
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:10,338
What the hell are you
doing back here, freak?

220
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,510
l thought they locked
you up for killing your mama.

221
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,890
l don't want any trouble, all right?

222
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:24,936
Oh, yeah? Well, trouble.

223
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:30,233
That's tough! Come on, you chickenshit.

224
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,654
-Hey, come on.
-Kick his ass, Ray.

225
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,448
You want a piece?

226
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:40,368
-Come on. Take a shot.
-Leave him alone, man.

227
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:45,206
Oh, yeah, keep walking.
You guys see that?

228
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,121
Eat this!

229
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,762
No!

230
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:03,410
Keep running, you freak!

231
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:07,580
l'll find you!

232
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:15,130
Walsh, l'm gonna kick your ass!
l'll find you.

233
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:22,137
These are my woods.
Nobody messes with me!

234
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,649
Larry! Larry!

235
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:46,119
There's no way they could
have come this far, Matty.

236
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,751
What the hell was that?

237
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:57,380
Ray! Kyle Walsh!

238
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:05,680
What are those guys doing? Batten,
get back there. Spread them out.

239
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:09,309
l'm just gonna stay right here
with you. Okay, Matt?

240
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:12,187
Okay, now that came from over there.

241
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:16,399
-You wait there, Larry.
-You got it.

242
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,044
Hey, Matt.

243
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,225
Matt?

244
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:56,356
Hey, buddy, this.... This whole
splitting up thing's kind of stupid.

245
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:58,108
Shit.

246
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,528
Oh, shit.

247
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:04,155
You're a grown man,
completely safe.

248
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:07,075
You're a grown man.
You're completely safe.

249
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:13,707
Get him off! Get him off!

250
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:27,220
''Light will spell her doom and death.

251
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:34,728
Brightest flame engulfed her whole,
setting free her wicked soul.''

252
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:55,123
Hey, Cat.

253
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,210
What happened to you?

254
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:03,131
Coming-home party.

255
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:07,469
Come here. Sit down.
You're bleeding.

256
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:10,638
Sit down. Come on, sit down.

257
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:19,731
Okay, l need to try to get
this gravel out of your scalp.

258
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:25,737
So how did this happen?

259
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:29,741
Okay.

260
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:37,582
How about telling me about the last 1 2
years of your life in 25 words or less?

261
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:43,421
l went to a foster home...

262
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:48,718
...and we moved out west
to Las Vegas...

263
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:53,556
...and now l work in a casino.
ls that 25 words yet?

264
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:55,350
Keep going.

265
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:59,020
Are you and Larry going out?

266
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:01,690
-Why do you ask?
-l don't know, l just--

267
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,734
Got it.

268
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:11,950
l don't know what l'm doing wrong.

269
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:19,833
-Don't give him any more tests.
-What?

270
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,210
They stuck me with every needle...

271
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:27,549
...gave me more Rorschachs than l
could count, and it didn't do a thing.

272
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:30,510
Don't let that happen to Michael.

273
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:32,262
Kyle Walsh.

274
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:35,348
You're gonna have to come with us.

275
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,278
You ever see anything like this,
Dad?

276
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:52,574
ln this town, you'd be surprised.

277
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:57,078
What's with all the flashlights?

278
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:03,084
-Are you afraid of the dark?
-Yes, sir.

279
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:06,296
lf you knew why,
you'd think l was crazy.

280
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,927
Klonopin.

281
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:16,056
Darvocet.

282
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,937
Shit, this one
l can't even pronounce.

283
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:27,734
Doc says half of these
are antipsychotics.

284
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:33,406
Now, l don't know much about
medicine, but it occurs to me...

285
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:39,412
...that if a man is taking antipsychotics,
he might have a tendency to become...

286
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:42,874
...well, psychotic.

287
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:46,211
Ray's dead.

288
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,380
He's dead?

289
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,466
l think you had something
to do with it.

290
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:56,596
l didn't kill him. l didn't do this.

291
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,723
No, it must have been....

292
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:02,811
l don't know.

293
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:05,063
He hasn't been the same
since his mom's murder.

294
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,023
He's not a killer.

295
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,402
How do you know?
You haven't seen him in 1 2 years.

296
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:14,656
Because l know. He's a good man.

297
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:18,702
-He's been a ward of the state.
-But he came to help Michael.

298
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:21,871
He was in a mental hospital
for nine years.

299
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:25,542
Caitlin, he's a dangerous guy.

300
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:31,840
l had a file sent over from State
Hospital about you. Ten feet long.

301
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:38,054
You spent a lot of time there. Major
disassociative syndrome, night terrors...

302
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:43,852
...sociopathic tendencies,
three suicide attempts.

303
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,104
l didn't do this.

304
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:49,482
You did it, Kyle. Don't turn away.

305
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:53,820
You killed your mother
and you killed Ray. Didn't you?

306
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:04,956
l need to call my lawyer.

307
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:09,753
-l don't believe this. l'm going.
-Caitlin, l'll be in touch.

308
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:15,383
Caitlin.

309
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:18,470
l have to get back to Michael
at the hospital.

310
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,681
Matt.

311
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:25,143
Keep working on your crap story.

312
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:30,065
Hope you got a good lawyer.

313
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:01,429
l can handle this.

314
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:04,641
l can handle this.

315
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:08,228
l can handle this.

316
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:19,739
Black cat.

317
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:22,075
Why not?

318
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:27,849
Michael!

319
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,270
Michael!

320
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:36,191
Michael, open the door! Michael!

321
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:40,987
-l'll call security.
-Michael? Can you hear me?

322
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:04,427
lt's okay.

323
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:11,601
-She's gonna get me.
-lt's okay.

324
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:23,863
Your brother is suffering from a form
of Pavor Nocturnus, or night terrors.

325
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:28,034
Because of his lack of sleep,
he's suffered a psychotic break.

326
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:34,207
Once that occurs, the subject can't
discern what is real and what is not.

327
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:38,753
-They begin to manifest a response.
-How do you mean?

328
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:44,759
A patient may hurt themselves because
they believe what they dream is real.

329
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:50,765
Michael feels that something
is after him, wanting to kill him.

330
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:56,354
And his self-inflicted wounds
are consistent with this fantasy.

331
00:39:56,521 --> 00:40:00,150
The good news is that there is
a procedure we can perform...

332
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:03,778
...right here, which has had an
overwhelming success rate.

333
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:06,823
-ls it surgical?
-No, not at all.

334
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:10,952
Michael is placed in a sensory
deprivation chamber.

335
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,789
He faces his fears and realizes
there's nothing to fear.

336
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:16,374
Tests.

337
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:20,628
-Michael hates the dark.
-Yeah.

338
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:22,756
That's the point.

339
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:30,263
ls there any other alternative?

340
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:33,433
Aggressive medication
coupled with counseling.

341
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:39,898
There are no guarantees. Meanwhile,
Michael might hurt himself again.

342
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,284
Ray and l were just sitting there,
having drinks...

343
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:53,953
...and Walsh starts fighting
with Ray....

344
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,374
-Where are my flashlights?
-Lab's not done with them.

345
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:00,877
That's all you remember?

346
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:04,089
The words you're looking for
are ''thank you.''

347
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:09,094
Hey, Kyle! Kyle, wait up!

348
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:15,141
l'm having a bad day, Kyle.
l had a dead guy fall on me.

349
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:20,397
You want to tell me where
you're going, huh? Kyle?

350
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:45,338
-How about a pistola? Huh?
-No.

351
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:51,761
Wait here a minute.

352
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:05,400
-Okay, now what?
-Where's your car?

353
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,902
-Why?
-l need a ride. Now!

354
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:13,241
Yeah. Car's over here. Hey, man,
you've been released into my custody.

355
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,910
-Kyle!
-lt's 5:35, Larry.

356
00:42:16,077 --> 00:42:21,875
The sun sets in 20 minutes. You've got
20 minutes to get me to the hospital.

357
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:29,007
We're almost set up.
lt'll just be another 1 5 minutes.

358
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:33,094
-Where's the other doctor?
-He had to get back upstate.

359
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:35,013
So you'll be doing this?

360
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:37,766
Why did you come back?

361
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:41,311
Do you know how long l've tried
to get through to her?

362
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:45,357
Her brother's always there
and then the ghost.

363
00:42:45,815 --> 00:42:47,067
A ghost?

364
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:49,694
You, man.

365
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:53,281
Nobody in this town
had a chance with her.

366
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,909
All she could think about was you.

367
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:59,871
-l need you to sign these.
-What are they?

368
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:04,042
Standard consent and release
of liability forms. He'll be fine.

369
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:07,253
Where are you taking me?
This isn't the way.

370
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,881
l'm not taking you to the hospital.

371
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:11,883
Lay low for the judge.

372
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:15,929
-l just want to help Michael.
-Michael's gonna be fine.

373
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:21,309
They're putting him in a sensory dep
tank. Gonna shut the lights out.

374
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:24,938
-They're putting him in the dark?
-Gonna fix him...

375
00:43:25,105 --> 00:43:27,899
...stop him from becoming
the next Kyle Walsh.

376
00:43:34,572 --> 00:43:39,202
lt's gonna be okay. l'm gonna be
watching you from the other room.

377
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:45,625
lf you put me in the dark,
she'll get me.

378
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:48,294
lt'll all be over soon, okay?

379
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:01,349
Turn this car around now.

380
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:10,316
Take me to Michael.

381
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,485
What if l don't?

382
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,571
Larry, don't look at her!

383
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:05,663
-Help! Help! Kyle!
-Larry!

384
00:45:06,831 --> 00:45:09,876
Help! Help me!

385
00:45:11,878 --> 00:45:15,632
Oh, God! Help!

386
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:02,929
Come on, Larry. l know it's in here.

387
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:09,978
-Saint Francis Hospital.
-"I need Caitlin Greene."

388
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:12,605
One moment, please.

389
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:17,068
-Miss Greene is unavailable.
-"This is Kyle Walsh."

390
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:22,699
-l need to talk to her now.
-"Sorry. Miss Greene is not available."

391
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:27,495
Don't let her put Michael in the dark.
l'm almost there.

392
00:46:30,957 --> 00:46:32,959
Hello, police?

393
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:48,558
Now, Michael, l'm going to need you
to hold still. Okay?

394
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:52,687
There might be just a little sting.

395
00:46:58,985 --> 00:47:00,695
-What's he doing?
-Hold him.

396
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:03,907
-There might be a burning sensation.
-Hold him down.

397
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:08,453
lt's all in.

398
00:47:09,996 --> 00:47:12,290
lt's all right. lt's almost over.

399
00:47:26,721 --> 00:47:28,390
Dim the lights.

400
00:47:44,155 --> 00:47:45,699
Stop!

401
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,828
Take him out of there!

402
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:52,664
Please, just do it.

403
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:57,961
Okay. The three of us are leaving.

404
00:47:59,045 --> 00:48:01,923
-Michael, it'll be okay.
-l got a car waiting.

405
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:03,425
Kyle!

406
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:07,971
Stop resisting, Walsh.

407
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:11,016
Stop resisting.

408
00:48:11,975 --> 00:48:13,852
Don't put him in the dark.

409
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:16,396
-Come on.
-Michael was right.

410
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:18,606
You have to believe me.

411
00:48:28,825 --> 00:48:32,037
-Let's see your lawyer get you out.
-That'll be tough...

412
00:48:32,203 --> 00:48:35,290
...since my lawyer's in pieces
on Ponus Avenue.

413
00:48:35,498 --> 00:48:37,542
ls that a confession?

414
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:44,674
Okay, l'll give this a shot.

415
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:49,888
l saw something when l was 1 0. You
heard the stories as a kid. We all did.

416
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:55,810
l saw her kill my mother. And once
you've seen her, she doesn't stop.

417
00:48:55,977 --> 00:48:59,606
l've stayed in the light since.
lt's the only way to be safe.

418
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:02,525
Michael has seen her too,
and she's coming for us.

419
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:06,446
l thought you'd say something
like that.

420
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:09,324
How many unsolved murders
have you had?

421
00:49:09,532 --> 00:49:12,369
Not just this year,
but in the last 1 00?

422
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:15,205
How many of them involved children?

423
00:49:23,213 --> 00:49:25,382
You're crazy, Walsh.

424
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:31,054
Crazy isn't what it used to be.

425
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:37,769
Yeah, Dad? We got him.

426
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:48,321
-What the hell's going on?
-No, no.

427
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:03,211
We're all gonna die.

428
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:06,840
Roy, you cover the docks, all right?
Get going.

429
00:50:07,465 --> 00:50:11,219
-What the hell is going on tonight?
-l don't know, Dad.

430
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:19,686
-Matt, take care of this.
-Yeah, all right.

431
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,356
-Batten, see what that was.
-No, you go see.

432
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:26,735
-l outrank you.
-Lead by example and see what it was.

433
00:50:26,901 --> 00:50:30,238
-Take a flashlight.
-Walsh, shut up.

434
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:32,866
Andy, give me your flashlight.

435
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:35,160
Stay in the light.

436
00:51:20,538 --> 00:51:21,831
Shit.

437
00:51:27,837 --> 00:51:29,255
Damn it!

438
00:51:31,716 --> 00:51:33,426
Come on.

439
00:52:11,464 --> 00:52:14,509
-What's going on here?
-Come on!

440
00:52:15,301 --> 00:52:18,972
-Jimmy, stay with me!
-l'm staying with you!

441
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,933
-Matt!
-Matt?

442
00:52:24,227 --> 00:52:27,147
-Go tell Batten l shot his dog.
-You shot Rocky?

443
00:52:27,313 --> 00:52:29,107
No, Phil. l shot at him.

444
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:31,443
lt was quick.

445
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:43,663
ls she gonna get me?

446
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:47,792
Yes.

447
00:52:54,632 --> 00:52:56,968
Man. What the--?

448
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,970
-Stay in the light.
-Shut up.

449
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:02,766
-Get in the light. Batten.
-Shut up!

450
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:23,870
-Get your flashlights!
-Over here.

451
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:26,164
-Walsh.
-Don't shoot.

452
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:30,877
She's in the building.
You have to believe me.

453
00:53:32,712 --> 00:53:36,091
Marnie, offices. Roy, check Andy.

454
00:53:36,675 --> 00:53:38,927
Phil and Mark, squad room.

455
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:40,595
You come with me.

456
00:53:42,555 --> 00:53:44,391
Oh, my God.

457
00:53:44,557 --> 00:53:46,309
-Andy.
-lnterrogation room.

458
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:48,812
-Get the flashlights.
-He's pretty bad.

459
00:53:48,978 --> 00:53:51,064
Please, get me a flashlight!

460
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:59,823
Stay in the light!
Don't shoot the lights!

461
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:02,075
She can't hurt you in the light!

462
00:54:06,996 --> 00:54:09,290
She's making you shoot the lights.

463
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:15,880
Let's go! Let's go!

464
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:18,967
Don't look at her!

465
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:22,721
-Don't look at her!
-Key 34!

466
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:27,934
Stay in the light!

467
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:31,312
Give me the flashlights.

468
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:46,786
Dad!

469
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:48,455
Dad!

470
00:55:00,383 --> 00:55:01,634
Dad!

471
00:55:08,516 --> 00:55:11,311
She's gonna go for Michael.
Take this.

472
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,280
-lt's okay, Michael. lt's okay.
-Caitlin, come on. lt's safe.

473
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:26,659
Get out from under the bed.
Come on, this is ridiculous.

474
00:55:26,826 --> 00:55:29,704
-No, you get under here.
-Come on, Michael.

475
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:32,123
There's nothing to worry about.

476
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,958
Caitlin, no!

477
00:55:46,638 --> 00:55:49,516
Okay, let's stay under the bed.

478
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:56,898
What the hell is that?

479
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,002
Run!

480
00:56:40,483 --> 00:56:42,027
Hello?

481
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:11,556
Go! Run!

482
00:57:13,224 --> 00:57:15,352
-Caitlin. Caitlin.
-Okay.

483
00:57:15,518 --> 00:57:17,979
-Get behind me, Michael.
-Caitlin.

484
00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:44,130
l knew you'd come back.

485
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:50,470
How do we stop it?

486
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:14,786
lt's all right. Come on.

487
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:19,582
-The hospital's losing power.
-Great.

488
00:58:23,169 --> 00:58:25,463
We need to get out of here now.

489
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:33,138
What the hell is that?

490
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:36,474
Go! Go! Go! Go!

491
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,685
Go! Go! Go!

492
00:58:39,436 --> 00:58:41,438
Get out now!

493
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:50,864
Help me!

494
00:58:57,871 --> 00:58:59,622
The bag.

495
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,417
-What?
-The bag of flashlights.

496
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:04,419
-Anybody grab it?
-No.

497
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:06,838
Damn. We need to get to the lobby.

498
00:59:07,005 --> 00:59:09,758
How long do we have
the emergency lights?

499
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:13,136
-A couple of minutes.
-That's all we need to get out.

500
00:59:14,804 --> 00:59:17,849
What is wrong with you people?
What's he doing here?

501
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:20,060
-l'm calling the police.
-They're dead.

502
00:59:20,226 --> 00:59:21,728
-All of them?
-Pretty much.

503
00:59:21,936 --> 00:59:24,898
-Where are the stairs?
-What is going on?

504
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,152
When this hospital goes dark,
we're all dead.

505
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:32,781
-Through to the old wing.
-l should evacuate patients.

506
00:59:32,947 --> 00:59:36,659
lt's not after them. lt's after us.
We saw it. They didn't.

507
00:59:36,826 --> 00:59:38,661
What about us?

508
00:59:39,287 --> 00:59:41,790
lf we stay in the light,
we stay alive.

509
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:49,214
This just keeps getting better
and better.

510
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,727
-Come on.
-Go. Go. Go.

511
01:00:05,605 --> 01:00:10,568
All right, stay in the light,
keep tight to the wall, single file.

512
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,240
Stay in the light!

513
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,662
-Jesus Christ.
-ls she okay?

514
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:22,163
Alex!

515
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:25,750
Keep going, Michael.

516
01:00:28,086 --> 01:00:29,838
Just stay in the light.

517
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:35,844
No!

518
01:00:38,555 --> 01:00:40,432
Run!

519
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,526
Wait, wait. Caitlin?

520
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:56,906
Kyle.

521
01:00:59,993 --> 01:01:02,037
-We have to jump it.
-Are you crazy?

522
01:01:02,245 --> 01:01:04,914
-Yeah, a bit.
-ls there any way she can get us?

523
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:07,167
We're gonna jump all at once.

524
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:10,962
We'll give her multiple targets.
Okay?

525
01:01:11,129 --> 01:01:12,547
-Kyle.
-Go on three.

526
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:14,883
One. Two. Three!

527
01:01:18,553 --> 01:01:20,055
Kyle!

528
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:22,807
Alex.

529
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:28,772
-We got one more to go. You ready?
-No, l'm not.

530
01:01:28,938 --> 01:01:31,399
-Kyle, hurry up.
-We go on three.

531
01:01:31,566 --> 01:01:33,735
One. Two.

532
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:36,613
-Okay.
-Three!

533
01:01:36,988 --> 01:01:38,990
Kyle!

534
01:01:41,951 --> 01:01:43,661
-She missed me.
-You okay?

535
01:01:43,828 --> 01:01:46,164
-Run!
-l'm getting the hell out of here!

536
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:49,376
-Caitlin! No!
-Get up!

537
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:52,295
No!

538
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:57,384
Kyle.

539
01:02:01,096 --> 01:02:02,972
Kyle!

540
01:02:04,391 --> 01:02:06,017
-Kyle.
-Help.

541
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,941
Look out!

542
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:17,696
lt's Matt!

543
01:02:18,988 --> 01:02:20,782
-Everyone in the car.
-Hurry!

544
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:23,284
-Go! Go!
-Hurry up. Get in the car.

545
01:02:23,451 --> 01:02:25,120
Go!

546
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:36,464
What the hell was that thing?

547
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,009
-Did you get them?
-Yeah.

548
01:02:39,175 --> 01:02:41,386
-What are you talking about?
-Gas cans.

549
01:02:41,553 --> 01:02:46,057
We're going to the lighthouse. lt's got
a gasoline-powered backup system.

550
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:48,059
lt's not far.

551
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:04,451
Why don't we keep driving?

552
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:07,370
We're safe in the car.

553
01:03:10,415 --> 01:03:11,833
Jesus Christ!

554
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:17,630
Goddamn it!

555
01:03:28,183 --> 01:03:30,852
-She's taking out the sirens!
-Keep going!

556
01:03:32,687 --> 01:03:35,482
-Everybody put your heads down!
-Michael!

557
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,035
No!

558
01:03:51,247 --> 01:03:55,377
lt's gone. lt's gone. lt's gone.
lt's gone.

559
01:03:57,962 --> 01:03:59,464
Got any lights back here?

560
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:02,384
There's two kerosene lanterns
in the back.

561
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:30,245
This must be it.

562
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:32,831
-l hope this works.
-lt has to.

563
01:04:53,268 --> 01:04:56,354
Kyle, there's the tank.

564
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,065
Come on.

565
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:08,491
Get all the gas in there.

566
01:05:10,618 --> 01:05:13,788
There's enough there to last us
a week. Let's go.

567
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:17,459
Let's go. Come on.

568
01:05:24,132 --> 01:05:25,717
All right.

569
01:05:29,554 --> 01:05:31,097
Come on.

570
01:05:31,973 --> 01:05:33,808
Let's go, Michael.

571
01:05:35,977 --> 01:05:37,896
Get up there, Michael.

572
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:42,275
lf that thing hates bright light,
she's not gonna come here.

573
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:51,743
Damn it. Come on.

574
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,661
-What happened?
-l don't know.

575
01:05:53,828 --> 01:05:58,249
Must be a fuel line blockage.
lt's not getting to the generator.

576
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:03,171
-That's encouraging.
-Lanterns aren't gonna last that long.

577
01:06:05,006 --> 01:06:08,718
-We're gonna have to go fix it.
-What do you mean ''we''?

578
01:06:08,885 --> 01:06:11,846
-You and me.
-No.

579
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:15,892
lt's the only way to do it.
We'll be right back, okay?

580
01:06:16,184 --> 01:06:19,521
-l promise.
-Kyle.

581
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:28,780
lf anything happens to me,
just keep that thing off them.

582
01:06:28,947 --> 01:06:31,700
All right, same goes for me.

583
01:06:31,866 --> 01:06:34,369
This thing's gonna kill us, isn't it?

584
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:37,122
Probably.

585
01:06:37,747 --> 01:06:40,041
All this over a fucking tooth.

586
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:46,131
-Do you smell that?
-Yeah, gas everywhere.

587
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:50,010
Don't drop that lantern, will you?

588
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:59,519
She comes at you fast, so be ready.

589
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:02,188
''She''?
You sound like you know her.

590
01:07:02,355 --> 01:07:04,649
She's been in my life a long time.

591
01:07:04,816 --> 01:07:06,568
-Hold up.
-Did you see that?

592
01:07:06,776 --> 01:07:08,945
Wait up for me. Stay in the light.

593
01:07:13,575 --> 01:07:16,911
Oh, man. lt doesn't look good.

594
01:07:19,581 --> 01:07:23,126
-There's gas all over the place.
-Yeah.

595
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:29,466
l've gotta tighten this rag
around this leak.

596
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:34,346
Hurry up.
This lamp's not gonna last long.

597
01:07:36,222 --> 01:07:41,686
-Caitlin, quickly. Here.
-What, this? Okay.

598
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,231
l need more light.

599
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:57,660
Get back. Get back in the light.

600
01:08:12,008 --> 01:08:14,094
The kerosene's almost gone.

601
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:19,683
Come on. Okay. Oh, God. Okay.

602
01:08:57,929 --> 01:08:59,472
Jump! Jump!

603
01:09:12,944 --> 01:09:15,196
Michael, get out of the dark!

604
01:09:15,864 --> 01:09:17,532
Come on.

605
01:09:34,632 --> 01:09:36,509
We're losing the light fast.

606
01:09:39,971 --> 01:09:44,517
l gotta move you. l gotta flip
the switch before the flame runs out.

607
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:50,565
Come on. Come on.

608
01:10:16,007 --> 01:10:17,509
Hit that switch, Michael.

609
01:10:18,343 --> 01:10:20,261
Go on, Michael.

610
01:10:24,724 --> 01:10:27,852
-Get it, Michael.
-l can't. l'm stuck.

611
01:10:28,019 --> 01:10:29,312
Go, Michael!

612
01:10:31,773 --> 01:10:34,234
This light's almost going out!

613
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,495
Go, Michael!

614
01:11:01,177 --> 01:11:03,722
Michael. Michael.

615
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:22,907
All right. Wait here, okay?

616
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:34,210
lt's all over.

617
01:11:36,171 --> 01:11:37,630
Come on.

618
01:11:37,797 --> 01:11:41,468
-lt's okay. Okay.
-Come on.

619
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:30,392
l see you, bitch!

620
01:13:09,472 --> 01:13:12,684
lt's okay. lt's okay, Michael. lt's okay.

621
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:58,355
Just leave this here, Billy.

622
01:13:59,481 --> 01:14:01,816
You're gonna go to sleep now?

623
01:14:02,192 --> 01:14:06,154
Just remember, don't peek.

624
01:14:30,595 --> 01:14:32,639
Tooth Fairy?

625
01:14:34,516 --> 01:14:38,019
lt's just Mommy, honey.
Go back to sleep.
