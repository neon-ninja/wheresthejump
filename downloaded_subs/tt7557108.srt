- Hi. Are you Maud?
- Yes. Hi.

14
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:58,500
So, I left some notes out
on the kitchen table with all her bits.

15
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,125
She has a mate
coming over tomorrow.

16
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,083
Try and keep her off the sauce.

17
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,625
Doctor's just started her
on a new course of B12 shots

18
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,167
so she's having one of those
every evening before dinner.

19
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:11,708
Your bedroom's upstairs on the left.
Her majesty's in there, having a nap.

20
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,708
How is she?

21
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:17,458

'Stage four lymphoma

Yep, yep.

'I daresay you'll be seeing
this one soon.'

29
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,375
- Feel that?
- Uh-huh.

30
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,375
- We done?
- Mm-hm.

31
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,458
What time would you like dinner?

32
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,708
Eight o'clock.

33
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,833
There's a shopping list
on the hall table.

34
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:44,792
I got it.

35
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,875

Spaghetti Bolognese and garlic bread.

41
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,458
Splendid.

42
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,708
- Is that temperature all right?
- Mm, it's fine.

43
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,875
Hello.

44
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,708
- Who's your saint?
- Mary Magdalene.

45
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:51,833
I didn't know
they made necklaces of her.

46
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,250
I ordered it online.

47
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,708
You're prettier than the last one.

48
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,333
Hey.

49
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:25,000
What do you think?

50
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,208
It's good.

51
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,417
- You must be Mary.
- No, Maud.

52
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:40,542
Ah.

53
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,292
Hope we're not turfing you out.

54
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:46,333
- No, no. I'm going to meet a friend.
- Good, good.

55
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,542
Cheerio, then.

56
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,583
'I should have told her
I'd be happy just to stay in my room.

00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,250
- Can you spare some change, please?
- Sorry, mate, I ain't got nothing.

59
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,583
Fuck off, then.

60
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,042
Excuse me, Miss.

61
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,500
Can you spare some change, please?

62
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,667
Thank you, love.

May God bless you
and never waste your pain.

65
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,917
- What?
- Nothing.

66
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:33,542

What's happened?

71
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,583
Come back to London.

72
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,250
You can't just lock yourself up here.
You should be around people.

73
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,125
Why the fuck do you care
so much all of a sudden?

74
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,875
Don't be petulant. You're getting
dangerously Norma Desmond.

75
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,917
Oh, fuck you!

76
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,708
You stupid cow.

00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,000
- Hello.
- Hello!

78
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:27,292
Sorry to call you back early.

79
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:30,292
Silly old thing used
to knock it back no problem.

80
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,917
Even I couldn't keep up with her.

81
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,583
Things are different now.

82
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,167
Yes.

83
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:36,333
Yes, of course.

84
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,542
Do you, um...
need me to do anything?

85
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:41,917
No.

86
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:45,458
- She'll be all right?
- Oh, don't be an idiot, Richard.

87
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:48,583
Yes, well...
take care of yourself, darling.

88
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,792
Pompous arsehole.

89
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:11,125
You should've seen him way back.
He was constantly trying to fuck me.

90
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,708
He has plugs now. Did you see?

91
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,500
- No.
- No.

92
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,625
Well...

93
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,833
No one sees
what they don't want to.

94
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:49,958
Stay with me.

95
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,667
I don't want to be alone.

96
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:12,333
How long have you been doing this?

97
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,792
Just over a year.

98
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,583
What were you doing before?

99
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,042
I worked at St Afra's hospital.

100
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:21,458
Horrible place.

101
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,167
Have you seen a lot of death?

102
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,125
Yes.

103
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,042
What made you leave?

104
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:40,458
I don't know,
I just needed a change.

105
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,458
I dunno.

106
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,667
I think I was spread too thin.

107
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,542
And it's what God wanted.

108
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:56,750
When he came, everything changed.

109
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:00,500
So this is a recent conversion?

110
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:07,333
When you pray,
do you get a response?

111
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,083
Sometimes he talks.

112
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,958
You hear his voice?

113
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:21,667
Most of the time it...

114
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:25,000
It's just like he's physically...

115
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,500
in me or around me.

116
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:31,250
It's how he guides me.

117
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:35,708
Like, when he's pleased,
it's like a...

118
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,625
a shiver or...

119
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,417
sometimes it's like a pulsing.

120
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,292
And it's all...

121
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,958
warm and good.

122
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,750
And he's just there.

123
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,542
Nothing feels real anymore.

124
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,208
Ever since I moved back here,

125
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,792
I keep thinking
about that last moment

126
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,792
and wondering...

127
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:17,083
...what it will be like.

128
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,042
What will I be looking at?

129
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,667
Will there be anyone else there?

130
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,167
And then what?

131
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:33,708
Nothing?

132
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,083
Tell me I'm wrong.

133
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,125
There is more.

134
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,292
And not just afterwards.

135
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,958
He's everywhere.

136
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,375
He sees you.

137
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:57,542
He won't let you fall.

138
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,250
My little saviour.

139
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,375
'Father, thank you.'

140
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
And bring your hand to join...

141
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,125
...your right hand.

142
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,917
And then draw a semi-circle
above your head.

143
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,792
'Now, don't get me wrong,
palliative care is noble work.

144
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,417
'But I always knew you had
something more planned for me.

00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,250
'But to save a soul,

00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,042
'that's quite something.

Oh.

- Cynthia left?
- Yes, I'm Maud.

- Carol.
- It's too late to be visiting now.

156
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,958
- It...
- She's expecting me.

157
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:05,292
She's sleeping.

00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,458
Hey.

183
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:10,958
No, I can't tonight.

184
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,542
You know where I am.

185
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:14,167
She's all right.

186
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:15,417
Bit weird but...

187
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:17,458
Shh. I gotta go.

188
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,625
Yeah, OK. Bye, bye.

189
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,042
Maud, your face.

190
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:39,125
Oh, shit.

191
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,708
Fuck, it's all over her dressing gown.

192
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:41,917
Shit.

193
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,292
Maud, I can do it.

194
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:49,583
- Don't let her drink too much.
- Don't worry, it's mostly for me.

195
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,125
Honey, come back to me.

196
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:02,333
'Religious themes would play
a prominent role

197
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,833
'throughout Blake's career,

198
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,875
'namely a rejection
of organised religion,

199
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,875
'which he claimed was an ugly distortion
of a true spiritual life.'

200
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,042
Hm.

201
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,250
Bye.

202
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:39,458
Carol?

203
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:40,583
Hey.

204
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:44,875
I need to talk to you.

205
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,292
Yeah?

206
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:54,958
- What's up?
- I want you to stop seeing Amanda.

207
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,792
- Huh?
- Just leave her alone.

208
00:28:57,917 --> 00:29:00,583
- Did she tell you to come after me?
- No, I'm telling you.

209
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,250
It's an important time for her.

210
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:06,000
She's got big things to deal with
and she needs to be focused.

211
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:10,125
And I just don't think
you can fit into that anymore.

212
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,125
I don't know
what you're talking about, but...

213
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,500
I'm sure your patient's sex life
is none of your business.

214
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:16,083
I know she's giving you money.

215
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,042
Again, none of your fucking business.

216
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:22,708
Look, I'm trying to be respectful.

217
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:24,958
I didn't swear at you or anything.

218
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:26,208
I just...

219
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:29,833
- I just don't think it's a good idea.
- Please. Respectful?

220
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,000
You just don't like
that she fucks women.

221
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:34,083
You could have
an eight-inch cock for all I care.

222
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:36,750
I'd still be telling you this
after the way you looked at her.

223
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,208
- Whoa. What?
- What was that, by the way?

224
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:42,958
Do you think you're too good for her?
Do you think this is a joke?

225
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,083
- Of course not.
- Amanda is dying.

226
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:48,625
I have a responsibility
to look after her.

227
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:51,958
This is life and death.

228
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,667
It's spiritual, on another level.

229
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,458
No hard feelings.
I'm sure you're great in bed.

230
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,500
But you're just a waste of her time
at the moment.

231
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:03,583
Can you hear yourself?

232
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,458
Maud, you're her nurse.

233
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:08,458
She doesn't want you to see it
but she is vulnerable right now.

234
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:12,333
And it is not right
that she spends her last days

235
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:16,042
getting worked up about a silly girl
who doesn't care about her.

236
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:18,042
- I care about her.
- Not enough.

237
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,500
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

238
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:23,667
Oh.

239
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:27,792
OK, so you'll do it?

240
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,250
Anything you say, Maud.

241
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,250
Don't tell her I told you, though.

242
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,292
Just, you know, make something up.

243
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,625
Don't hurt her feelings.

244
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,792
OK.

245
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:43,125
OK.

246
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,542
'I think it went well.

247
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,500
'A whole day
and her phone has been silent.

248
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,250
'It must be a relief to her too.

249
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:11,292
'She radiates peace,

250
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:14,833
'and I am reminded of myself
in the first flushes of your love.'

251
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:21,042
'We don't need anyone else.'

252
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:39,042
Katie?

253
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,958
Katie!

254
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,708
Katie, hey!
I thought that was you.

255
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:51,042
How's it going? It's been ages.

256
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,083
Yeah, good.

257
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,417
How are you, Joy?

258
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:59,458
Yeah, not bad, not bad.
You know, knackered.

259
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,208
Got patients sleeping in corridors.

260
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,750
Surgeries all double-booked.
It's a total madhouse.

261
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,708
So, how's it going?
Are you taking care of yourself?

262
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:10,833
Yeah.

263
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,750
We all thought you must've left town.

264
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:14,458
No one sees you
out and about anymore.

265
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:17,625
- I've been around.
- Oh, yeah?

266
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,167
- What are you up to?
- I'm a private carer.

267
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,958
You're still nursing?

268
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,625
- What?
- Nothing.

269
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,083
Just surprised. I mean...

270
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:29,625
- Where are you doing it? Who with?
- A private agency.

271
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,583
- And they know what happened?
- Yes.

272
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:36,500
Well, I've got to go.
It was nice to see you, Joy.

273
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,000
Katie.

274
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:50,792
Take my number, yeah?

275
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:51,958
What?

276
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:56,042
If you ever want to talk
or get a drink or... anything.

277
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,667
That one there.

278
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,042
Yes, and then that one.

279
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,250
Uh, you can't do that.

280
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:33,333
What?

281
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:37,167
You... you slipped those cards in.

282
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:38,833
Did I?

283
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,208
It's no fun if you cheat.

284
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:47,083
Which one was it?
Hm, that one.

285
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,625
Can you give me a moment?

286
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,792
- Uh, yes.
- And take that away.

287
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:59,000
- Ooh, can I have a cup of tea?
- Of course.

288
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,000
Hello.

289
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,208
I didn't expect to hear from you.

290
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:18,042
What do you mean?

291
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:21,542
Why?

292
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,958
There you go.

293
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:47,083
You know, I've been thinking,
it might be nice to go out sometime,

294
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:48,833
to the theatre or something.

295
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:53,250
I would have no clue what to see
but I'm sure you can suggest something.

296
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:57,250
- And maybe after I leave...
- I want to go to bed.

297
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,583
It's five o'clock.

298
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:04,042
I will go to bed
when I damn well like.

299
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,458
Yes, of course.

300
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:10,125
Now is not the time.

301
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:40,375
I need you to go into town.

302
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Yeah?

303
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:44,250
To pick up some things for tonight.
I'll make a list.

304
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,333
OK, no problem.

305
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,917
Oh, yes!

306
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:54,333
- Is it ready?
- I'm just lighting the candles.

307
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,250
Plates.

308
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,167
Get the lights.

309
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:22,875
♪ Happy birthday to you

310
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,083
♪ Happy birthday to you

311
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:32,083
♪ Happy birthday, dear Amanda

312
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:36,167
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

313
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:46,000
- Lights.
- Make a wish.

314
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:03,375
So, Carol,
how did you and Mandy meet?

315
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,833
We met online.

316
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:06,583
Ah, so now you have
a ménage à trois.

317
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:09,125
Hardly. Maud doesn't like Carol.

318
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:14,250
It's funny, I can't figure out
if she's a bigot or if she's just jealous.

319
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:18,458
She went sneaking behind my back
to try to scare Carol away.

320
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:24,125
To save my soul,
if I understand correctly.

321
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,167
Excuse me.

322
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:31,042
Don't run away.
I'm talking to you.

323
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:34,083
Maud is my saviour, you see.

324
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:38,875
She's been looking out for me
in more ways than one, but...

325
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,042
you got a little carried away,
didn't you?

326
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:44,792
So, what is it?

327
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:48,625
Am I indecent?

328
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,875
No, you're lost.

329
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:55,208
Richard, want to show us
some moves?

330
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,208
There's my little saint.

331
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:38,000
Oh, no, no.
Sweetheart, no, no, no.

332
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:41,375
You know you shouldn't take
anything I say seriously.

333
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,208
I just wanna see you loosen up.

334
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,375
You are a beautiful young woman,

335
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,208
and you should have some fun
while you still can.

336
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:52,375
I've got more important things
on my mind.

337
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,000
Oh, yes, of course.

338
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:57,833
How could mere human frivolity
possibly compete

339
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,333
with the heavenly Father's
warm heart pulsing...

340
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:03,875
Let's go. Let's go.

341
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:22,250
Maybe if you just let me talk to her.

342
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:24,083
No, absolutely not.

343
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:26,542
You should be thankful
she isn't pressing charges.

344
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:32,750
Ms Köhl expressed
some other concerns.

345
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:34,000
Is everything all right?

346
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,792
I'm fine.

347
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:58,708
'God,

348
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,958
'all I feel of you now is this pain.

349
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:03,750
'A gnawing burning.

350
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,958
'Maybe it's ulcers or cancer

351
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:10,750
'or appendicitis.

00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:40,208
'Quite frankly
it all just seems such a waste.

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,583

00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,125
'unemployable,

358
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:51,583
'unoccupied.

359
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:59,458
'Perhaps you weren't as wise
as I thought.

360
00:44:01,292 --> 00:44:03,417
'Perhaps I wasn't paying
enough attention.

361
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:18,667
'I can't help but feel
an act of spite has occurred.

362
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:31,167
'If this is how you treat
your most loyal subjects

363
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:35,792
'I shudder to think
what awaits those who shun you.'

364
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,292
Yes, that's it.

365
00:46:19,417 --> 00:46:20,500
Yeah, yeah.

366
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:23,167
Oh, yes. Oh!

367
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:27,292
- Not yet.
- Oh!

368
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:28,708
Oh, God!

369
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:30,458
Oh, sorry. Oh.

370
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,583
See you later.

371
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:45,250
Hey, Joy, it's Katie.

372
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:51,792
Hey. Yeah, I was just wondering
if you wanna go for that drink,

373
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:55,625
you know, have that chat
and just hang out,

374
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,625
like you said, to chat.

375
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:01,042
Cool. Great.

376
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:02,458
That's great.

377
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:05,250
Well, you know,
if I'm honest with you,

378
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,750
I did think it was kind of weird
when I saw you and you suggested it,

379
00:48:08,875 --> 00:48:11,708
just because you never seemed
to like me that much.

380
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:14,583
No...

381
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:18,208
No, no, no, no.
I didn't... I didn't mean...

382
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:19,500
Don't be like that.

383
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:24,625
Well, I'm just at the Star
at the moment with some friends,

384
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:27,750
but I think they're heading off soon
but I'm gonna hang around a bit.

385
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:29,542
Oh, sorry.

386
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:31,875
Yeah, of course.

387
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:36,125
In that case, my apologies.

388
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,917
I'm being stupid so, uh, bye.

389
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,375
Oh, careful.

390
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:24,875
You owe me a drink.

391
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,083
Is everything OK?

392
00:49:58,042 --> 00:49:59,667
Shh, shh, shh.

393
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:03,167
Shh, it's OK. It's OK.

394
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,250
Shh.

395
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:09,292
Come on.

396
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:12,000
- Easy.
- No.

397
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:13,250
Easy!

398
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,917
I remember you, you know.

399
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:50,083
You used to be out all the time.

400
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:52,083
While back.

401
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:54,583
I think...

402
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:57,792
you and my mate Tommy had it off.

403
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:02,375
Ah, I remember you.

404
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,000
A lovely, lovely little nursey, hey?

405
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:05,875
I did everything.

406
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,792
Everything.
I changed, didn't I?

407
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,125
I thought I did
what you told me to do.

408
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,250
Didn't I?

409
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:18,667
Please.

410
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:20,792
Please don't let me fall again.

411
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:23,500
I'm begging you.

412
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:26,167
I'll do anything.

413
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,375
Please guide me.

414
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:34,792
'Revelation, and just in time.

415
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:40,667
'Oh, Lord, your mercy
knows no bounds.

416
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:42,958
'For shame
that I almost fell so easily.'

417
00:56:35,042 --> 00:56:37,000
'I should have expected resistance.

418
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,958
'Nothing worthwhile comes easily.

419
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,917
'Amanda.

420
00:57:05,042 --> 00:57:07,250
'Amanda, Amanda.

421
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:08,875
'You called to me, Amanda.

422
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:12,042
'It was no small thing.

423
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:13,667
'It meant something.

424
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,250
'Never waste your pain.

425
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:21,625
'Never waste your pain.'

426
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:32,792
Beautiful.

427
00:58:32,917 --> 00:58:33,917
Mm.

428
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:39,917
- Do you mind if I sit?
- Hm? Course not.

429
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,375
Oh, you don't work at St Afra's,
do you?

430
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,958
Oh, no, no.
I'm a private carer.

431
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:53,125
Oh, right.

432
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:57,375
I have a friend who works at St Afra's
and I wondered if you knew her.

433
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,333
Oh, their uniform is blue.

434
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,333
I honestly have so much respect

435
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:05,833
for anyone in the medical profession.

436
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:07,333
Like, any area.

437
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:10,833
I really think
it's the most important thing

438
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:13,042
you can do with your life, almost.

439
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:16,417
Thank you.
That's so sweet.

440
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:19,625
Yeah, it can be really rewarding.

441
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,583
Not all that glamorous, but yeah.

442
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:25,333
- I love it.
- I bet you get no time for yourself.

443
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:28,375
Oh, it's fine. I have my own life.

444
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,125
My own things.

445
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,792
Got choir practice.

446
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:38,417
This person you're with at the moment,
what's wrong with them?

447
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:39,667
Oh, I'm...

448
00:59:41,167 --> 00:59:43,792
...not really supposed
to discuss the details.

449
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:46,083
But you have a good relationship?
You get on with them?

450
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,292
Mm, really well.

451
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:51,250
I'm with a lovely lady at the minute.
We're good pals.

452
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,042
That's one of the things
I love about the job.

453
00:59:56,167 --> 01:00:00,333
You find yourself quickly building
these quite meaningful relationships

454
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:04,000
and, you know,
you're often right there

455
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:06,583
at a very important time
in people's lives.

456
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:10,167
Yeah.

457
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:12,500
Although that sometimes
makes things harder in the end.

458
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:13,875
When you have to leave?

459
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,625
No, when they die.

460
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:20,875
I don't think I'll be with this one
much longer to be honest with you.

461
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,375
Sadly...

462
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,167
that, as they say,

463
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:26,958
is how the cookie crumbles.

464
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,167
Oh, I'm Esther, by the way.
What's your name?

465
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:47,250
'What if I'm getting it all wrong?

466
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:53,000
'What if you are smirking
or indifferent

467
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:55,667
'or think me a clueless idiot
like that stupid woman?

468
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:01,083
'Is that how Amanda
saw me all along?'

469
01:02:59,292 --> 01:03:00,750
How will I know what to do?

470
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:46,250
Katie?

471
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:51,458
Katie, it's Joy.

472
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,375
There you are.

473
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,333
Oh, sorry.
Did I get you out of bed?

474
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:06,292
- Mind if I come in?
- I'm busy.

475
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:08,792
I'll be quick, I promise.
I'm just on my way to work.

476
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:13,042
Thanks, love.

477
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,250
Oh.

478
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:19,375
This is nice.

479
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,750
Cor, you ain't half tidy, are you?

480
01:05:28,917 --> 01:05:30,958
I hope you don't mind.
I got your address from work.

481
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:32,792
Just wanted to see how you are.

482
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:40,458
Oh, this is cool.

483
01:05:41,167 --> 01:05:42,583
I like all this.

484
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:45,792
Sorry I couldn't see you
the other night.

485
01:05:45,917 --> 01:05:49,333
I was so shattered, I don't think
I would've been much fun.

486
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:51,000
I tried to call
but you didn't pick up.

487
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,542
Want a ciggie?

488
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:00,750
How's work going?

489
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,750
Are you not
with a patient at the moment?

490
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:15,625
I've been feeling bad about the way
I reacted last time I saw you.

491
01:06:16,583 --> 01:06:18,042
I'm sure you're doing a great job.

492
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:20,042
You always did.

493
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:22,042
And I know you put
a lot of pressure on yourself.

494
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:28,250
What happened before,
it wasn't your fault. I know that.

495
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:31,042
You do too, right?

496
01:06:38,542 --> 01:06:40,333
What's going on, Katie?

497
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:44,250
Come on, you can tell me.

498
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:49,417
Look, I know it's a bit late now,
but I wanted to tell you.

499
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:52,792
We should have been there
before it all happened.

500
01:06:54,042 --> 01:06:56,250
We could see
you were struggling for a while.

501
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:16,167
I know it feels like everyone's
in their own little bubble.

502
01:07:19,083 --> 01:07:20,667
But it does help to share.

503
01:07:39,667 --> 01:07:42,042
May the Lord bless
and keep you, Joy.

504
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:44,292
You what?

505
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:47,417
It was sweet of you to come
but you mustn't worry.

506
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:50,917
You're right,
back then I was so lost.

507
01:07:52,042 --> 01:07:54,833
But now I am transformed

508
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:57,875
and soon everyone will see.

509
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,583
Right. Well, that's good.

510
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:05,458
Thank you, Joy.
Thank you for coming.

511
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:13,125
Oh? Oh, right.

512
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,542
Are you sure you're OK, then?

513
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:21,833
Oh, fuck, I should go, actually.

514
01:08:28,708 --> 01:08:30,875
I'm gonna come back later, all right?

515
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,083
All right.

516
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:34,375
I'm really glad
things are looking up.

517
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:36,792
See you later.

518
01:11:48,792 --> 01:11:51,042
I'm so sorry.

519
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:53,833
I was unkind to you.

520
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:57,083
You made me think of things
I didn't want to.

521
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:01,458
It's all right.

522
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:04,542
- No.
- It is, Amanda.

523
01:12:05,542 --> 01:12:07,708
The Lord forgives that
which is said in anger.

524
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:11,000
He knows your heart.

525
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:12,500
The Lord.

526
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:13,875
Yes, God.

527
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:17,500
God sent me to you.

528
01:12:19,542 --> 01:12:21,000
He forgives everything.

529
01:12:22,625 --> 01:12:24,667
You only have to ask.

530
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:33,500
Heavenly Father...

531
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:35,542
- No, no.
- Bless this woman in her pain.

532
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:38,875
No, none of that nonsense.

533
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:46,708
Amanda?

534
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:57,792
You must be the loneliest girl
I've ever seen.

535
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,417
I'm here, Amanda.

536
01:13:04,042 --> 01:13:05,167
I am not alone.

537
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:08,083
And neither are you.

538
01:13:08,208 --> 01:13:09,458
No.

539
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:12,208
Snap out of it, honey.

540
01:13:17,417 --> 01:13:18,625
He isn't real.

541
01:13:20,042 --> 01:13:21,667
You must know that.

542
01:13:24,542 --> 01:13:25,708
No.

543
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:28,208
You felt him too, remember?

544
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:30,167
We both did.

545
01:13:30,292 --> 01:13:31,375
No, honey.

546
01:13:32,792 --> 01:13:34,458
I didn't.

547
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,333
That's not true.

548
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:43,875
You have no idea
how dull it is to be dying.

549
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:54,292
I hate to be the one to break it to you
but it's just you and me here.

550
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,333
Nothing you do matters.

551
01:14:10,333 --> 01:14:12,708
Well, that was easy.

552
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,458
Devil.

553
01:14:29,042 --> 01:14:32,167
Take responsibility for your actions.

554
01:14:32,292 --> 01:14:35,542
You came back here
because you are alone.

555
01:14:35,667 --> 01:14:37,875
If you were a true believer,
He would be enough

556
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,958
but it's clear now
you are as weak as your faith.

♪ I saw the light

558
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:21,917

564
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:38,250

565
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:42,458
- Oh, my God!
- No, no, no, don't!
