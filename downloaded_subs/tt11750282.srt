00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,500
NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,458
Do you know why I'm here, Eric?

3
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:13,375
Your parents called me
because they're worried about you.

4
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,666
Want to tell me what's wrong?

5
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,625
You can trust me.
I've helped kids like you.

6
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,125
There are other kids like me?

7
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,500
Of course.

8
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,750
Let me guess.

9
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,125
You're sad
because you had to leave your school

10
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,833
and your old house, right?

11
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,500
Eric, it's normal to be angry.

12
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,541
I don't like moving either.

13
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,375
But this is a very pretty house.

14
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:46,083
And you'll make new friends soon,
and it will be just like before.

15
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,291
Tell me, why do you have
so much trouble sleeping?

16
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,208
They always wake me up.

17
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,166
Who wakes you up?

18
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,166
The voices.

19
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,166
"Voices"? Your parents?

20
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,708
And what do the voices say?

21
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,416
Sometimes they ask me to draw things.

22
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,541
Eric, do you hear them right now?

23
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,208
Yes.

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,541
And what are they saying?

25
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,625
I can't tell you.

26
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,166
What's wrong with him?

27
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,333
He has a lot of imagination.

28
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,208
And the voices he says talk to him?

29
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,541
Your son is a very intelligent boy

30
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,916
who's had to get used to playing
and talking by himself, that's all.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,208
And why can't he sleep?

32
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,291
Sara told me
you buy houses to resell them.

33
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,708
Yes, that's right. We renovate them.

34
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,666
It's likely because of the instability
from so much moving.

35
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:10,416
That can cause anxiousness
and trouble sleeping.

36
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,208
It makes total sense.

37
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,458
There's a chance of showers.

38
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,833
Everywhere else will be
partly cloudy with lower temperatures.

39
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:07,375
A front will move in from Algeciras
bringing rain across southern Spain.

40
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,500
You're fucking kidding.

41
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,708
Dad, can you hear me? Over.

42
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,291
Dad here.

43
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,833
You have to say "over," over.

44
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,500
Dad here, over.

45
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:51,500
Can you get my ball out of the pool?
It went in there again, over.

46
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,833
On my way, over.

47
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,875
It's good you waited outside.
I don't like you to go in alone.

48
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,291
If it goes in again, let me know.

49
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,458
-What's that for?
-This?

50
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,083
Know what an infestation is?

51
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,625
The flies that live in my fireplace?

52
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,666
I don't think it's just your fireplace.

53
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,583
But don't say a word to your mom.

54
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,666
She'll kill me for buying an old house.

55
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,791
Eric.

56
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,041
It's bath time, Eric!

57
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,833
Come on, buddy.

58
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,875
See if you can steal it.

59
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:24,916
Come on.

60
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,375
He hates you…

61
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,333
You didn't rinse yet?

62
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,125
-I did.
-Come on, tip your head back.

63
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,375
What's this?

64
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,875
Were you playing with the cats?

65
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,375
I told you not to go near them,
you could catch something.

66
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,791
-Mom?
-What is it?

67
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:37,958
What is it?

68
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,666
Does Dad really hate me?

69
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,958
Where did you hear that nonsense?

70
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,958
I asked you a question, Eric.

71
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,250
Dad.

72
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,833
Dad said that? When did he say that?

73
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,041
On the walkie-talkie.

74
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,666
Don't lie.

75
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,041
Dad loves you very much, you know that.
Don't you?

76
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,583
Come on, it's dinnertime.

77
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,375
I've got your number in my contact list--

78
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,625
There's a man stuck to your back.

79
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:18,833
We're joined by Germán Domingo
for the release of his latest book,

80
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,375
titled Sounds from The Great Beyond.

81
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,875
How do you know an EVP is authentic?

82
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,791
They are voices that come
from a place with a lot of pain.

83
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,625
Believe me, when you hear a real one,

84
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,958
it's something you'll never forget.

85
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,875
How many of the EVPs
you've analyzed are real?

86
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:36,791
Very few.

87
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:40,833
Almost none, I'd say.
Most come from humans.

88
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,291
They're voices
from the street or the neighbor's TV.

89
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,458
-Dani.
-Yes?

90
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,875
Is it true real EVPs…

91
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,208
Did you scold Eric
or say something to him?

92
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,625
No, nothing. Why?

93
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,916
-Why these recordings don't have…
-Never mind, forget it.

94
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:58,916
…oscillations in the waveform
is something we haven't figured out.

95
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,083
You heard the psychologist,
there's nothing seriously wrong with him.

96
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,666
Once he makes a friend at school,
he'll be fine.

97
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,416
Sometimes he says things…

98
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,375
I don't know.

99
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,458
I think he's mad at me.

100
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,916
I'll try to get organized
and have more time to spend with him.

101
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,625
That would be good.

102
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,291
Don't worry.

103
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,458
Damn it.

104
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,583
Shit… Damn gate.

105
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,750
Not now. Let me sleep, I'm really tired.

106
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,208
What is it, sweetie?

107
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,291
-Please don't! Please!
-Easy, it's OK.

108
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,583
Please!

109
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,375
Easy, you're OK now.

110
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,666
-Please!
-What is it? You're OK.

111
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,375
Eric? What's the matter?

112
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,208
I don't know.

113
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:42,208
Honey, come here. It's OK.
It was just a bad dream. It's OK.

114
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,333
Dani… your hand.

115
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,291
Damn it.

116
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,000
Jesus, what a disgusting house.

117
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:34,875
Damn it.

118
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,000
-Why are you here? What happened?
-He got expelled.

119
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,375
-What did you do?
-Nothing.

120
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,708
What do you mean "nothing"?

121
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,500
He hid in a closet and when the principal
went to get him, he bit him.

122
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,250
-Does that seem normal?
-Why did you do that, partner?

123
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,833
Dr. Carol will come
every day starting tomorrow.

124
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,166
The doctor is dead.

125
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,666
-Where did that nonsense come from?
-The voices told me.

126
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,416
Go to your room
and start your homework, go on.

127
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,875
I can't do this alone, Dani.

128
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,500
I'm sorry. I'm truly very sorry.

129
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,041
If there's anything we can do, just--

130
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,208
I understand.

131
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,708
I understand. Goodbye.

132
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,666
What happened?

133
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,375
Her car went off the road
shortly after leaving here.

134
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,083
How did he know?

135
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,500
How could he know?

136
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,125
Someone must have
told him at school, right?

137
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,250
What's going on, Dani?

138
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,458
I don't know.

139
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,791
Can I come in, partner?

140
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,458
-I brought you a sandwich.
-I'm not hungry.

141
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,041
You have to eat something, come on.

142
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,833
Eric, before I came
in your room last night…

143
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,666
…you were talking on the walkie, right?

144
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,333
-To who?
-To you.

145
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,708
I didn't talk to you, partner.

146
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,500
It was your voice.

147
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,208
Go on, finish your sandwich.

148
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,875
Am I crazy, Dad?

149
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,250
You're not crazy at all, son.

150
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:10,375
You're just confused from the move
and all this mess, that's all.

151
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,750
I don't like this house.

152
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,958
Didn't you want a house with a pool?

153
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,416
I don't want to swim there.

154
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,333
Why don't we move somewhere else?

155
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:24,250
Until your mom and I fix it up,
we can't resell it, so…

156
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,708
Remember how well the last one went?

157
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,458
-We made a killing.
-Exactly, we made a killing.

158
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,958
Is Mom still mad at me?

159
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,750
She'll get over it, don't worry.

160
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,375
Go on, eat.

161
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:30,916
Dani…

162
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,666
Dani…

163
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,125
The pool gate.

164
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,750
Is someone there?

165
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,708
It's too late to play.

166
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,833
We're doing this again?

167
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,041
Eric!

168
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,458
Eric!

169
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,166
Eric!

170
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,125
Eric!

171
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:48,500
Eric!

172
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,291
Eric!

173
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,500
Eric!

174
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:14,791
Eric!

175
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,500
Are you sure
you don't want to come too?

176
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,666
It'd be good for you
to get away for a few days.

177
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,583
I have to finish as soon as possible.

178
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,375
Give your parents my regards, OK?

179
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,625
What will we do with the house?

180
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,958
I don't know, Sara.

181
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:33,250
Right now, I don't know.

182
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:34,958
I can't live here.

183
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,666
And what do you suggest?

184
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:43,500
I don't know if you've realized,
but all our money is invested in this.

185
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,958
All of it, Sara.

186
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:03,291
Take care.

187
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,791
Hurry up, we're getting wet.

188
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:30,500
Mom, look.

189
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,291
It's cool, right? Incredible.

190
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,333
-It is so big.
-Come on.

191
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:37,083
Wow, it's really big!

192
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:39,000
Yes, but there's a lot to fix.

193
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,541
Can we keep this one?

194
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,625
Yes, for a while. Then we'll see.

195
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:45,041
You know how this goes.

196
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:48,625
Three, two, one… Ta-da!

197
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:53,833
Wow, it's really cool. It's so big!

198
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,166
And it's your room.

199
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:57,916
-Seriously?
-Yes.

200
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,291
-What color should we paint it?
-Can we hang up my drawings?

201
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:05,125
Yes, just like the last house.
Drawings all over.

202
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,916
Downstairs too, in the kitchen.

203
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,541
Dad, can we go swimming in the pool?

204
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,750
-Have you seen the water? And it's cold.
-Then we'll clean it.

205
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,416
Or I can take this room.

206
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,333
-No.
-No?

207
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:22,625
-Hi, honey. How are you?
-We can decorate that tree over there.

208
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,958
I'm really sorry
for how I acted this morning.

209
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:27,833
I didn't want to argue.

210
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:28,833
-Seriously?
-Yes.

211
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,583
-Yes, there or there.
-Talk to you later, OK?

212
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,791
-It's huge.
-Can we have a barbecue?

213
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:35,666
-Yes, of course.
-I love you.

214
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:38,416
I don't think he likes this room, huh?

215
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,375
-I do like it!
-No.

216
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,750
-I do, Mom.
-No, you don't like it.

217
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,458
-Yes.
-No.

218
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:44,166
He doesn't like it. We'll take this room.

219
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,875
Are you sure you like it?

220
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:50,625
-Yes.
-See? You don't like it.

221
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:53,708
The robot doesn't like it either.
He doesn't want to stay here.

222
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:54,791
I'll take this room.

223
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,333
Hello?

224
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:10,291
Sara, what is it?

225
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,583
What's wrong? Is everything OK?

226
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,708
Yes, why?

227
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:21,791
I couldn't understand your message.
There were weird voices, like screams.

228
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,500
I don't know, it scared me.

229
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:26,458
-Are you sure you're OK?
-Yes.

230
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:29,416
The service here is bad, maybe that's it.

231
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:30,750
Alright.

232
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:34,333
Listen, I'll call you later, OK?

233
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,541
OK. I love you.

234
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:37,458
I love you too.

235
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,541
Hi, honey. How are you?

236
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:12,333
Hi, honey. How are you?

237
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:32,666
How are you?

238
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,750
Dad, help!

239
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:05,750
-For Javier.
-Javier.

240
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:09,416
Yes, thanks a lot.
It's an honor. I have all your books.

241
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,250
SOUNDS FROM THE GREAT BEYOND

242
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:12,458
-Thank you.
-Thanks a lot.

243
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:13,500
-You're welcome.
-Yes.

244
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,333
Well, I'll leave you to it.

245
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:17,875
TO MY WIFE, WHO'S WAITING FOR ME
ON THE OTHER SIDE

246
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:20,708
Excuse me, who should I dedicate it to?

247
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,125
To Daniel.

248
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:24,541
To Daniel.

249
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:31,875
Here you go.

250
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,333
Are you a fraud, Mr. Domingo?

251
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,541
-What was that?
-Is what you say in your book true?

252
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:42,791
Look…

253
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,125
I've published over ten books
on electronic voice phenomena.

254
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:49,750
If I didn't believe they were true,

255
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:52,125
I would have wasted my entire life.

256
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,125
I need you to listen to a recording.

257
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,916
Send it to me, my email is in the book.

258
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,375
I need you to listen now, please.

259
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:01,583
My son just died.

260
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,375
I think I recorded his voice.

261
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:09,416
I know it's hard to accept
the loss of a loved one,

262
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,666
especially a child,

263
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:13,708
but you're clinging
to something that won't return.

264
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:15,208
I'm asking you, please.

265
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,750
You're the only one who can help me.

266
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:22,416
Look,
this isn't how these things are done.

267
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,125
The waveform doesn't change
when the recording is playing.

268
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:31,541
Your book says that's a sign
that the EVP is real.

269
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,250
Isn't that right?

270
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:39,166
You think this one's real?

271
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,625
-Did you see the file I sent?
-Yes.

272
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,458
It may have been tampered with.

273
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:50,125
Why would a father fake
the voice of his dead son?

274
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:54,250
I don't know, Dad.
You just get so excited and then…

275
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:57,125
I have a feeling that this one is real.

276
00:34:58,875 --> 00:34:59,708
Fine.

277
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:09,375
CIVIL GUARD
DO NOT ENTER

278
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,708
Should I unload?

279
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:14,208
-Is that a joint?
-It sure is.

280
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:17,833
It's a rolled cigarette.

281
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:20,958
As smart as you are,
I don't know how you can still smoke.

282
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,791
-Thanks for coming so soon.
-It's my pleasure.

283
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:25,666
Ruth, this is Daniel…

284
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,791
Velasco. Daniel Velasco.
Pleasure to meet you.

285
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,458
I'm so sorry about your son.

286
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:33,041
-Shall we go inside?
-Yes, of course.

287
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:42,041
I apologize for the mess,
but I'm sure you understand

288
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,750
it's been a tough few days.

289
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,333
Don't worry about it.

290
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,541
-Is anyone else here?
-No.

291
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,791
My wife is with her parents.

292
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,375
Is there a more secluded room,

293
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:56,208
a basement or something
for me to set up in?

294
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:58,416
No basement,
but there are many empty rooms.

295
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,125
What's this?

296
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,833
My son said someone talked to him on it.

297
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:07,541
In fact,
he said it was my voice he heard.

298
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:10,458
I understand.

299
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:19,291
In the recording, it sounded like
my son was shouting asking for help.

300
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,958
Do you think
he's trying to tell me something?

301
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,291
It's possible.

302
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:28,041
But I'll warn you,
the message may not be pleasant.

303
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,708
What do you mean?

304
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:32,750
Look…

305
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,333
I am sure that…

306
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:39,958
what comes after death
isn't what we've been told all this time.

307
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:44,375
Are you saying
my son is somewhere horrible?

308
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:47,958
He was only eight.
What could he have done to deserve that?

309
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:53,041
And is it any less horrible here?

310
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:57,791
Wars,
children starving to death, disease…

311
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,250
Why wouldn't it be the same there?

312
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:08,625
I can't tell you your son is
in heaven surrounded by angels, Daniel.

313
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:10,333
I'll tell you what I know,

314
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:14,125
and what I know
is we have to be ready for anything.

315
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:19,166
If my son needs help,
I'm willing to do anything, Mr. Domingo.

316
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:34,541
How did it happen?

317
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:36,333
Couldn't he swim?

318
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,291
He knew how to swim.

319
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:46,625
The police think he must have gotten
caught on a branch trying to get his ball.

320
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,666
But I know that's impossible.

321
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:53,833
He never came in alone. He didn't like it.

322
00:38:57,333 --> 00:39:00,458
Don't ask me why, but I have a feeling
something else happened that night.

323
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:34,208
-Everything OK?
-Jesus!

324
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:36,208
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

325
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,375
Don't worry, I'm just a little jumpy.

326
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:41,291
That's not the best trait
for this job, is it?

327
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:43,375
This isn't my job.

328
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:46,708
I just help my dad occasionally.

329
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:48,416
What's all this for?

330
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:53,416
For studying sounds
that the human ear can't hear.

331
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,166
Sounds from The Great Beyond,
like your dad's book.

332
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:59,958
Well, unlike him,
I don't think they come from the dead.

333
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,208
I'm sure the voice
I recorded was my son's.

334
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:10,958
How's it going, honey?

335
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:12,958
Everything is almost ready.

336
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,833
We can start whenever.

337
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:16,708
Then let's start.

338
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,625
Point towards the corner.

339
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,000
Are you getting anything?

340
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:31,958
No, nothing is registering.

341
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:37,083
Dad, I really don't think
we'll find anything.

342
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:38,500
Patience, sweetie.

343
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:41,416
Without patience,
we can't discover anything.

344
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:43,708
Are you enjoying this?

345
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:46,458
What's so bad
about enjoying your work, Ruth?

346
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:49,416
I don't know how Mom could stand you.

347
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:09,916
Dad.

348
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,333
What is it?

349
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:15,333
Tell Daniel to get out, he's interfering.

350
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,791
-Ruth.
-Yes?

351
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:27,541
What's going on?

352
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:29,583
You can't be seeing Daniel.

353
00:41:29,666 --> 00:41:32,541
Of course I can.
He's in his son's room, I can see him.

354
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:36,583
I can see him too and he's outside.

355
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,750
You see something
in the boy's room, right?

356
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:01,916
This is really strange.

357
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,458
Can you hear that?

358
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:27,375
Yes.

359
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,208
It's coming from upstairs.

360
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:39,666
I'm going up.

361
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,291
Please be careful.

362
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:00,000
Can you see it?

363
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,000
Is it still here?

364
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:10,375
Dad.

365
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,416
-Ruth? I'm losing you.
-Dad…

366
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:14,458
-Ruth?
-Dad, do you hear me?

367
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:15,416
Ruth?

368
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,791
I'm losing you, Dad…

369
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:19,833
Dad, can you hear me?

370
00:44:19,916 --> 00:44:21,625
Yes, I can now. What is it?

371
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:23,291
You have to get out right now.

372
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:24,708
What's going on?

373
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:26,291
It's right in front of you.

374
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:27,083
This is incredible.

375
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,250
Who is it?

376
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:33,291
I wish I could answer that, Daniel.

377
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:35,791
You were there. Didn't you see anyone?

378
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,416
I didn't see anyone or anything.

379
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,333
You're saying
there's a presence in my house?

380
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:45,333
Well…

381
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,375
Accept it for what it is,

382
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:49,500
a paranormal phenomenon.

383
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,750
You recorded that figure.

384
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,458
A thermal figure, Dad.

385
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:56,833
And to record a temperature,
it needs a physical body.

386
00:45:56,916 --> 00:46:00,541
Just because we don't understand…
it doesn't mean it isn't real.

387
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,833
We have to try again tomorrow.

388
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:10,833
Germán.

389
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:19,583
Who's there?

390
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:28,708
Is that you, honey?

391
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:33,208
Come on. Come here.

392
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:00,958
Come on.

393
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:03,041
I'm waiting for you.

394
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:45,458
Hello, my love.

395
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:56,791
I'm dreaming.

396
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:03,291
Does this feel like a dream?

397
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:10,000
I bet you don't know what I'm making.

398
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:13,000
Sit down.

399
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:43,458
It's been so long.

400
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,000
Have you missed me?

401
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:50,875
I miss you every day.

402
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:57,708
You look the same, Sofía.

403
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:00,708
There had to be some advantage.

404
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:12,166
I've been waiting
for this moment for so long.

405
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:14,291
Haven't you?

406
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:17,791
I have too.

407
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:27,916
No.

408
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:39,291
We'll be together again.

409
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:52,958
Don't be afraid, my love.

410
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,875
Dad! What are you doing?

411
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:05,125
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing? Daniel!

412
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:08,291
Dad, look at me! Dad!

413
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:10,541
Daniel!

414
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:12,541
Daniel!

415
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:14,583
What are you doing?

416
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:16,250
Daniel!

417
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:37,250
UNKNOWN CALLER

418
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:49,791
Hello?

419
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:51,750
Hello?

420
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,333
Mom.

421
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,041
Who is this?

422
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:57,875
It's me, Eric.

423
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:00,583
Who is this? Is this a joke?

424
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,083
Mom, you have to come help me.

425
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:06,416
Eric?

426
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,333
Eric.

427
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:13,708
Mom, please. That man wants to hurt me.

428
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:14,666
What man?

429
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:18,208
A man Dad brought over.

430
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:19,875
Eric, where are you?

431
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:23,625
I'm hiding in my room, under the bed.

432
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,166
Hurry, pleas--

433
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,291
Eric?

434
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:27,791
Eric?

435
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:52,750
Daniel!

436
00:53:58,541 --> 00:53:59,708
Have you ever seen this?

437
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:02,583
Never.

438
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:05,583
I think I read about it.

439
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:07,583
What does it mean?

440
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:09,000
I don't know.

441
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:15,541
But… I don't think we can trust
what we see or what we hear.

442
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:18,208
It may all be a trick, Daniel.

443
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:20,000
A trick by who, Germán?

444
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,541
I don't know, Daniel.

445
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:23,750
Look…

446
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,250
I'm afraid the voice you recorded…

447
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:30,166
…may not have been your son's.

448
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:32,750
I'd recognize my son's voice anywhere.

449
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:51,375
-Why are you here?
-Who is that?

450
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:53,083
-Why didn't you call?
-Who is he?

451
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:54,791
Germán, a friend. He's a writer.

452
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,333
Sara, wait.

453
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:40,791
Come inside.

454
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,833
Come on.

455
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:47,041
You're from the house
with the voices, right?

456
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:09,666
You shouldn't go back there.

457
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:13,500
The voices know things about us,
they trick us,

458
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:15,833
and before you know it…

459
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,000
it's too late.

460
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:17,916
Eric?

461
00:57:24,291 --> 00:57:25,125
Eric?

462
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:35,375
Eric?

463
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:37,625
Eric?

464
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:48,416
Sorry my wife was so rude.
This has been very hard on her too.

465
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,666
Here it is.

466
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:52,375
I knew I'd seen it before. Look.

467
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:54,166
What is this?

468
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:56,416
What does it mean?

469
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,583
It's a threat.

470
00:59:57,666 --> 01:00:01,666
It was used in the Middle Ages to warn
outsiders they were in her territory.

471
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,833
-Whose territory?
-A witch's territory.

472
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,833
It's this house.

473
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:11,875
It seems there was a court here
300 years ago.

474
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:13,208
A court, here?

475
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:14,791
The Inquisition.

476
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:19,000
Yes, they must have tortured and killed
dozens of innocent women here.

477
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:23,083
It's hard to believe
someone deserved to be burned.

478
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:28,958
But even though it was usually
an injustice, evil has existed--

479
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,708
Sara!

480
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:36,458
Dad, are you OK?

481
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:39,458
Sara! Hold on.

482
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:42,791
Sara!

483
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:46,458
Sara!

484
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:50,833
Sara!

485
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,875
Have you seen them argue lately?

486
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:54,666
Not really.

487
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:58,375
Like I said before,
I've only known Daniel for 24 hours.

488
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:04,291
Yeah, sure, if I remember anything,
I'll let you know.

489
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:20,583
If you remember anything, call us.

490
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:22,166
-OK.
-Thanks a lot.

491
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,541
Honey, I want you to see this.

492
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:27,750
Dad, we have to talk.

493
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:31,750
I think I know where to find
the remains of the people tortured--

494
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:34,833
Dad, listen to me. We have to leave.

495
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:36,666
-I'll get our stuff.
-But Ruth…

496
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:39,500
You heard the voices too.

497
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,958
They're here.
they're trying to tell us something.

498
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:44,250
I've been looking for this
my whole career.

499
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:46,375
We can't go now. Don't you get it?

500
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:47,625
I can't leave.

501
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:51,083
You're doing all this
because of Mom, right?

502
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,250
What do you mean?

503
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:55,708
What happened?

504
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:01,875
Dad, tell me what happened.

505
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:04,791
I think I deserve to know
why she did what she did.

506
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:07,041
I'm not a little girl anymore.

507
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:10,625
You're still my little girl.

508
01:04:11,833 --> 01:04:13,333
It's over, we're leaving.

509
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:20,041
I hope one day you realize running
from everything isn't always the solution.

510
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,291
Dad, come here.

511
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:49,791
What is it?

512
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:16,125
No!

513
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:20,291
-What did I do?
-It wasn't you.

514
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,541
What was that?

515
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:56,083
-Daniel!
-Shit!

516
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:58,708
-What?
-She's here!

517
01:07:58,791 --> 01:08:00,833
-Daniel, easy.
-Can't you feel her?

518
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:02,875
-I hear her everywhere.
-Nobody's here.

519
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:04,500
I'm telling you she's here!

520
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:06,125
Easy, it's OK. Nobody's here!

521
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,333
Nobody's here.

522
01:08:08,416 --> 01:08:10,083
Look at me, Daniel. Nobody's here.

523
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:13,166
Easy, nobody's here.

524
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:14,916
It's OK. Look at me.

525
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:17,833
It's OK, Daniel. Easy.

526
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:19,541
Everything is OK.

527
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:30,375
Alright.

528
01:08:31,291 --> 01:08:32,750
How do you live with this?

529
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:39,583
How do you live knowing your son
is asking for help and you can't help him?

530
01:08:45,958 --> 01:08:49,625
Knowing you'll never really know
what happened to your family?

531
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:54,666
How the hell do you live with this?

532
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:56,958
It's not easy, Daniel.

533
01:08:57,541 --> 01:08:58,625
I can assure you.

534
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,541
It's all my fault.

535
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:14,500
I asked them to come here.

536
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:21,583
Now I'm alone.

537
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:23,708
You're not alone.

538
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:27,875
Look…

539
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:31,916
I think I know where we can find…

540
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:35,291
…the root of what's happening
in this house.

541
01:09:43,291 --> 01:09:46,458
If this was a court,

542
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:50,541
the people killed here
have to be hidden under our feet.

543
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:57,458
I think I know how we can get in.

544
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:05,666
Jesus.

545
01:13:08,208 --> 01:13:10,041
What the hell happened to her mouth?

546
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:15,041
The Holy Inquisition believed
the punishment

547
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:17,583
should fit the crimes committed.

548
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:24,291
If the crime was blasphemy,
lying, or manipulation,

549
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:29,416
the torture was applied to the victim's
mouth so they couldn't use it anymore.

550
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:46,916
Kill her!

551
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:47,833
Witch!

552
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:53,250
You'll pay for your crimes!

553
01:13:56,541 --> 01:13:57,708
It was her voice.

554
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:01,708
That's why they tried
to silence her forever.

555
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:07,333
All her rage has been
locked up in here all this time.

556
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:14,583
According to tradition, the only way
to destroy a witch is to burn her.

557
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:20,041
Here, take this one.

558
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:22,583
It won't be enough.

559
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:25,875
-I must have another.
-I'll go down, we have to hurry.

560
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:30,541
-Where's Daniel?
-He'll be right down.

561
01:14:30,625 --> 01:14:31,500
You stay here.

562
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:33,541
-What? No way--
-Listen to me, Ruth.

563
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:35,875
You asked for the truth
about your mom's death.

564
01:14:35,958 --> 01:14:38,916
You want to know why she killed herself,
you want answers?

565
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,125
Well, I don't know, Ruth. I wish I did.

566
01:14:41,666 --> 01:14:45,375
I dragged you here
and I can't lose you too.

567
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:47,958
Promise me if I'm not back in ten minutes,

568
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,625
you'll leave this house immediately.

569
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:52,541
Promise me.

570
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:54,750
Fine.

571
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:12,791
No!

572
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:17,291
No!

573
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,375
Dad!

574
01:17:47,916 --> 01:17:49,250
Dad, are you OK?

575
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:51,000
Dad?

576
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:06,041
Daniel, is that you?

577
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:00,125
My baby.

578
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:04,041
Don't you remember me?

579
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:08,000
Mom, is that you?

580
01:19:10,416 --> 01:19:12,083
You've grown so much, my love.

581
01:19:13,041 --> 01:19:14,666
You're a woman now.

582
01:19:16,125 --> 01:19:18,500
Come here, I want to see you.

583
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:24,500
I was very sad
because you didn't say goodbye to me.

584
01:19:25,916 --> 01:19:27,458
You didn't come to my funeral.

585
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:31,666
Dad wouldn't let me.

586
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:36,000
I'm very sorry I couldn't be with you,
sweetheart.

587
01:19:37,791 --> 01:19:40,791
But you're here now, we're together.

588
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:41,791
Come here.

589
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:44,666
Give me a hug.

590
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:49,000
Don't you want to hug your mom?

591
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,416
You're not my mom.

592
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,791
How could you say such a terrible thing?

593
01:19:53,875 --> 01:19:56,666
Come, my love. Give me a hug.

594
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:57,833
No!

595
01:22:52,125 --> 01:22:53,750
Don't let him do it, Dani.

596
01:22:56,666 --> 01:22:59,333
If you let him, we'll disappear too.

597
01:23:11,083 --> 01:23:12,750
I miss you both so much.

598
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:14,833
I miss you too.

599
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:17,625
Why don't you want to be with us anymore?

600
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:39,333
Dad.

601
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:50,708
Ruth.

602
01:24:57,583 --> 01:24:58,708
Fight, Ruth.

603
01:24:59,666 --> 01:25:00,916
You have to fight, honey.

604
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:19,041
Don't make me do it.

605
01:26:05,791 --> 01:26:07,833
What's going on? What happened, Dad?

606
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:10,333
-You're hurt! Come on!
-Alright.

607
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:13,666
Let's leave!

608
01:26:22,166 --> 01:26:23,166
Come on.

609
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:26,000
Careful. Watch your head.

610
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:30,625
Dad, I have to treat this, OK?

611
01:27:15,625 --> 01:27:16,458
Dad…

612
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:19,375
How are you?

613
01:27:20,583 --> 01:27:21,958
I'm fine, honey.

614
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:27,625
Do you think it worked?

615
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,500
I hope so.

616
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:33,083
But we're not staying to find out.

617
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:44,083
I can imagine
how you must have felt all this time.

618
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,541
But I needed an answer too.

619
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:52,666
That's why you started all this, right?

620
01:27:53,916 --> 01:27:55,083
I always thought…

621
01:27:56,916 --> 01:28:00,208
…there was something dark
behind your mom's death.

622
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:06,166
When she left us
in such a horrible and senseless way,

623
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:10,375
I understood evil exists
and it lies in wait.

624
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:14,333
And if that's the case…

625
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:21,250
…maybe good spirits
are nearby too, right?

626
01:28:24,416 --> 01:28:25,250
So, now what?

627
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:29,041
Now you can live your life.

628
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:32,666
-Or maybe…
-"Or maybe"?

629
01:28:34,875 --> 01:28:36,208
A few days ago…

630
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:40,250
…a friend who's a priest emailed me.

631
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:42,625
He wants me to interview a girl.

632
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:43,958
An exorcism?

633
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:48,750
I'm sure it's an untreated illness,
but you never know.

634
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:49,791
Sure.

635
01:28:51,166 --> 01:28:53,083
Well, you need to rest for now.

636
01:28:53,583 --> 01:28:55,416
And I need a week-long vacation.

637
01:30:36,958 --> 01:30:38,750
Dad, help me!

638
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:12,458
Please let me go.

639
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:18,291
Mom!

640
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:24,458
No!

641
01:31:33,041 --> 01:31:34,291
Let me go, Dad!

642
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:36,666
Please help me!

643
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:02,416
Daniel?

644
01:32:32,125 --> 01:32:33,041
Ruth!

645
01:32:38,041 --> 01:32:40,166
Daniel!

646
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:41,083
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou…

647
01:36:41,166 --> 01:36:45,958
Lord, hear our prayers
and don't allow our enemy to defeat us.

648
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:49,458
-Unleash your wrath on the beast.
-…now and at the hour of our death.

649
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:51,541
-Why am I here?
-And release your servant

650
01:36:51,625 --> 01:36:53,333
so she is no longer prisoner.

651
01:36:53,833 --> 01:36:54,916
Now and forever…

652
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,333
In the name of the Father,

653
01:36:56,416 --> 01:36:59,375
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

654
01:36:59,458 --> 01:37:00,541
Amen.
