00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:12,580
<b>THEY LOOK LIKE PEOPLE</b>

2
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:15,581
Subrip:
Pix

3
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:20,879
Can we not do your office?

4
00:01:20,912 --> 00:01:24,616
Can we meet
somewhere in the park...

5
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,618
In the park?

6
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:33,459
You too, sir.

7
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,828
You are a mountain.

8
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,798
You are a hundred miles high.

9
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:16,801
You are invincible.

10
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:19,572
You are forever.

11
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:23,643
-Those that try to hurt you...
-what?

12
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:27,212
-How are you man?
-Sorry, are you busy?

13
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:29,314
-Look at you.
-Your...

14
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:30,583
Your number changed.

15
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:34,654
Yeah. It's amazing
to see you.

16
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,756
Yeah, um, I'm just staying
up, with someone nearby,

17
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:44,329
and I thought I'd say hi.

18
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:46,731
-What are you doing now?
-Well, I got in this morning,

19
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:48,400
but now, nothing.

20
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:50,669
I just,
thought I'd say hi,

21
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,671
and...

22
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,474
Come up.
Give me your bag.

23
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:56,776
-I got it.
-No, it's cool,

24
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:58,978
I've been working out.
Come on.

25
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,715
-Jeez.
-Kitchen,

26
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:05,750
living room area, weird room I
don't really know what to do with,

27
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:08,920
it used to be Kat's
clothing warehouse.

28
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:11,524
You guys... i thought you
were getting married.

29
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:13,225
Yeah. Hey!

30
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:14,993
I heard you and Hannah
got engaged. That's amazing.

31
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:17,896
You gotta tell me all about
how you asked her.

32
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,498
So, this is the basement.

33
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:22,468
It's for killing people,
or raping animals.

34
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:25,638
Why am I showing
this to you?

35
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,615
You comin'?

36
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:41,820
Very cool.

37
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:45,458
Kat and I were always
gonna have a party up here,

38
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,894
but, then we didn't.

39
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:03,675
Okay, come on.

40
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:19,959
So, tell me about
your engagement.

41
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:23,629
So, where is she?
When's the wedding?

42
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:28,466
No wedding.

43
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,336
What happened?

44
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:32,538
She...
Cheated on me,

45
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:35,775
and then broke up with me,
if you can believe it.

46
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:45,884
-You guys were together...
-stupid, it's better though.

47
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:51,857
Do you need
help cleaning?

48
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:53,858
No, man, I'm sorry,
I'm just...

49
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:56,394
I've been trying to get up the
courage to ask this girl on a date,

50
00:04:56,427 --> 00:04:58,363
for, like, the past five
months, and I finally did,

51
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:00,598
so I have
this date tonight.

52
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:03,636
I should
be going anyway.

53
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:06,604
No. No, no, no, no, no. Seriously,

it's between, me and her,

54
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:09,079
and her friend's coming along too,
so it's perfect. You should come.

55
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,265
I don't have anything to wear.

56
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,645
Yeah, but you're
staying close by, right?

57
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:15,014
When do they get home?

58
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:17,450
It's fine...

59
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,718
You know,
we'll hang out later.

60
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,085
I got... I...

61
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:31,797
Stop.

62
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:33,699
Just stop. Just tell
whoever you're staying with

63
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:35,134
you're crashing
here tonight, okay?

64
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:42,742
I've a killer camping mat for
all the bitches I bring over.

65
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,714
Put your stuff down.

66
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,796
Hey. Remember that
date we have tonight?

67
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:07,866
Why don't you just get a little
friend to come along with you

68
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,634
at the last second?

69
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:12,638
Do not be a bitch.

70
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:16,675
The only thing that will get in
your way and make you hate yourself

71
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,645
is if you are a bitch.

72
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:22,648
You're a mountain.

73
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,254
Hey, man. The girls
are super excited.

74
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:37,857
Um, can I ask
you something?

75
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,869
Does it really
go down that far?

76
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:07,252
Are these your jeans?

77
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:11,789
She's been
at behemoth five months,

78
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:13,291
she's moved up twice.

79
00:08:13,324 --> 00:08:15,593
She makes dudes cry,
I gotta man up.

80
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:18,831
She sounds horrible.

81
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:20,598
You're not gonna answer it?

82
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:23,102
No, if it's important,
she'll text.

83
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:40,785
Are you calling
an ambulance?

84
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:43,054
Okay. Should...
Should we...

85
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:44,289
Yeah, yeah,
no, we'll just come.

86
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:45,890
Class and leopard.
Great.

87
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:50,328
Um... okay.
Change of plans.

88
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,564
I don't know
if a taxi's gonna come by here.

89
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:55,067
-I can't walk anymore in these shoes.
-Guys, you didn't have to come.

90
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,135
Wyatt's really good
with this stuff.

91
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:59,004
She slipped on the ice.

92
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:00,239
Hey, I'm Wyatt,
what's your name?

93
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:01,974
-Sandy.
-Hey, Sandy.

94
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:03,975
-Nice to meet you.
-Yeah.

95
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,978
Okay, you mind if I take
a look at your face?

96
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,046
You look great.

97
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,816
-Do you remember hitting your head?
-I... no.

98
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:15,354
Can you look this way
for just a second?

99
00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:17,789
You might want to take her to a
hospital if you want to be safe.

100
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:20,893
I hate ambulances. Emts are perverts
who smell like French fries.

101
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:51,856
-Wakey, wakey.
-Hey.

102
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,725
What you doing
sleeping in the stairway?

103
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,129
-I was...
-My gosh.

104
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,333
-You're um...
-did I fall asleep?

105
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:05,770
Yup. You look like
you fell asleep.

106
00:10:05,803 --> 00:10:08,039
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

107
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:09,641
Is everybody okay?

108
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:11,976
-We're okay, are you okay?
-Yeah.

109
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:15,047
You wanna go get
some snacks?

110
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,918
Ahem. Mara Drake.

111
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:22,754
Yeah?

112
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,255
Thanks for staying
all that time.

113
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:25,823
Honestly, it's no big deal.

114
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:27,425
We're just gonna take
a cab from here.

115
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,928
-You sure?
-Yeah, boy scout.

116
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:33,131
She's just
really embarrassed.

117
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,352
-Don't get any ideas.
-Don't flatter yourself.

118
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:58,923
-Okay, night.
-Okay.

119
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:01,894
Good night.

120
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:20,878
I think she likes
you anyway.

121
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:22,247
You want some?

122
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,948
I'm okay.

123
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,486
Hey, I gotta go
to work tomorrow.

124
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,356
Are you looking
for um, a new...

125
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,927
Job?

126
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,427
You're cool.
You're probably cool.

127
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:37,895
I'm leaving town.

128
00:11:37,928 --> 00:11:39,932
I have
the bus tickets, so.

129
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,441
Well, you're staying
here till then.

130
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,282
Was tonight
just supposed to be a date

131
00:11:57,315 --> 00:12:00,052
between
the two of you?

132
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:02,088
It wasn't a date.

133
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:10,395
Thank you.

134
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:12,498
All I know
is now that you're here,

135
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,999
everything's
gonna get awesome.

136
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,048
You should be very careful.

137
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,115
Do not look
at Christian.

138
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:42,020
Go down to the basement
of your building right now.

139
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:54,099
We warned you
not to go into the cities.

140
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:57,368
In the cities,
they are everywhere.

141
00:13:57,402 --> 00:13:59,937
Their plan
is almost complete.

142
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:01,572
If we do not stop them,

143
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:04,576
they will enslave the butcher
in every good person

144
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:06,278
left on earth.

145
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:10,349
You must prepare
for the war.

146
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:12,049
You want to protect
your friend,

147
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:14,586
but helping him
will be impossible.

148
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:17,522
He is good.
He is still human.

149
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:20,224
But he will not believe you.

150
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:23,394
Leave the city tonight.

151
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:26,564
We still do not know
how to infect the host.

152
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:29,433
Never look at their eyes.

153
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:31,302
When I reveal
my identity,

154
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:33,471
you must never contact me,

155
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:35,072
ever.

156
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:37,275
Here is what you must do.

157
00:15:16,981 --> 00:15:19,350
You've reached the offices
of Dr. James calvino.

158
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:20,619
Please leave a message.

159
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:22,621
Hello, sir.

160
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:26,591
This is Wyatt goodwin. I'm sorry
to be calling you so late.

161
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:30,228
I was wondering if we could
move our meeting to tomorrow.

162
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,096
Please let me know.
Thank you.

163
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:01,225
Can I get a copy
of these, please?

164
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:22,346
-Morning.
-Hey, man. What you doing there?

165
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,415
Just making a sandwich.
I brought some coffee, too.

166
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:27,019
Thank you.

167
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,086
How'd you sleep
last night?

168
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:30,088
Great.

169
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,656
-Air mattress okay?
-Yeah. Real comfortable.

170
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,460
Nice.

171
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:38,764
Hey, were you still working
at that repair store in nc?

172
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,365
Landscaping and maintenance
at the sisters of mercy.

173
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,701
-It was a nunnery.
-That's wild.

174
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:47,538
Yeah. They didn't need
anybody as much, so.

175
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:50,307
Wanna grab lunch
with me today?

176
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:55,413
-I, gotta run some stupid errands.
-Great.

177
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:59,384
Um, hey, man, I made an extra set
of keys for you. It's no big deal.

178
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,186
I don't,
I don't need keys.

179
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:02,521
I'm gonna leave
in a few days.

180
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:04,789
It's New York,
you need keys.

181
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:14,600
Nuns?

182
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:36,315
You are an ocean.

183
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:41,585
Weapons, swords and knives

184
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:46,457
all flow through you
like nothing.

185
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,728
You encompass
the entire world...

186
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,797
in your depth.

187
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:26,263
-There he is.
-Hi.

188
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:27,766
You look ten-feet tall.

189
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:36,307
I don't think
I'm schizophrenic.

190
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,609
I looked up
some stuff online.

191
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:45,450
Never any drugs.

192
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:48,886
No alcohol
for about ten weeks.

193
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,288
No caffeine.

194
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:53,524
All right.

195
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:56,260
It's the plight of the lame
and the boring, what a joke.

196
00:19:58,262 --> 00:20:00,865
Did you ever have
a long-term relationship

197
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:04,403
that didn't wind up
letting you down?

198
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,974
This friend
I'm staying with.

199
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,742
Chris,
the little skinny guy?

200
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:22,586
Is there some medication
you can give me?

201
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:23,654
Sure.

202
00:20:23,688 --> 00:20:26,291
-Will it help?
-Yeah.

203
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:33,732
Anything else?

204
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:39,537
It's stupid.

205
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:44,475
There was
this one dream, once.

206
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:48,814
Where certain people
around me didn't look human.

207
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:53,852
It started with my fiance.

208
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:57,422
I never want to see
what she turned into again.

209
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:01,826
It's like
they're in my head,

210
00:21:01,858 --> 00:21:04,361
they're listening to me.

211
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:06,798
It's getting worse.

212
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,868
I know
it's silly, right?

213
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,671
Do your parents
know about this?

214
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:14,638
No, is that all right?

215
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:16,575
Yeah.

216
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:22,614
So what do we do now?

217
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:24,415
You come in.

218
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:46,403
I'm still in mid-town.

219
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:48,372
Give 'em a call.

220
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:50,408
They'll set you up
for next week.

221
00:21:52,743 --> 00:21:55,547
You'll be all right.

222
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:57,982
Honestly,
I'm feeling better already.

223
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,365
You are a fire.

224
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:17,468
All that your enemies
place in your way...

225
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:19,904
Betrayal,
lies, poison...

226
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,776
You devour

227
00:22:24,808 --> 00:22:27,445
and become stronger.

228
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,618
You are unstoppable.

229
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,021
You are holy.

230
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:39,624
You are terrible.

231
00:22:39,656 --> 00:22:41,692
It's a whisper room.

232
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:43,661
-Come in.
-No.

233
00:22:43,693 --> 00:22:46,097
Yes, come on.
It's soundproof.

234
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:51,836
Welcome. Switch places.

235
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:52,971
It's cool, right?

236
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:55,039
Yeah.

237
00:22:59,076 --> 00:23:01,546
Thanks for helping us
last night.

238
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:07,419
-How's Sandy?
-Concussed, but fine.

239
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:10,622
Um, remember that lame
bottle of peach schnapps

240
00:23:10,654 --> 00:23:13,791
that you got me when I first
started working here?

241
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:17,061
Joyce told me that you get
one for every new girl.

242
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:18,062
Yeah, totally.

243
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:21,700
Well, I threw mine away.

244
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:28,006
If I can prove to you
I'm a psychic,

245
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:30,174
do you want to try again
tomorrow night?

246
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,645
Give me your hand.

247
00:23:37,748 --> 00:23:40,619
Now pick a number
between one and ten.

248
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:51,695
-Seven.
-What? Damn it.

249
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:53,865
You will have
three loves in your life.

250
00:23:53,897 --> 00:23:58,101
Those are life lines, goofus.

251
00:23:58,134 --> 00:24:00,070
Here.

252
00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:07,011
My grandma used
to do voodoo.

253
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:26,597
Hey, do you think
we have anything for Wyatt?

254
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,033
Like, client services,
or anything?

255
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:31,736
I can ask Gerald.

256
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:34,838
I talked to them
about you, by the way.

257
00:24:34,872 --> 00:24:37,976
Maybe some good news
for you on Friday.

258
00:24:39,844 --> 00:24:42,647
Thank you.

259
00:24:44,815 --> 00:24:46,718
What's it say?

260
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:52,190
This line says that you're a loser.
This line...

261
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:53,991
-I could do a move.
-Yeah?

262
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,927
-I could do a move.
-No, I meant like, later.

263
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,562
Like, not right now,
that's weird.

264
00:24:57,595 --> 00:24:59,230
So, okay, here it is,
you wanna follow me now?

265
00:24:59,262 --> 00:25:01,098
-I don't think so.
-Just kidding. No, go ahead.

266
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,866
-Really?
-Yeah, it's good. Yes, I think so.

267
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:07,005
My god!
Okay, that was good.

268
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:09,874
Are you okay?
I got your scarf.

269
00:25:09,906 --> 00:25:12,210
-Okay. Thanks.
-I'm sorry.

270
00:25:12,242 --> 00:25:13,944
When somebody's
coming at you,...

271
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:16,114
you've gotta
like, get them.

272
00:25:16,146 --> 00:25:17,714
-Like, see how you did that?
-Yeah.

273
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:19,150
That's the motion
that you want, in judo,

274
00:25:19,182 --> 00:25:20,652
is you want
somebody to go, "

275
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:22,086
-okay. Yeah.
-So you go like this.

276
00:25:22,118 --> 00:25:24,054
-Then you're gonna go around,
-yeah.

277
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:25,964
And then you wanna
choke them from here.

278
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:26,590
Yeah, yeah.

279
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:28,092
-And then...
-it's good. I'm sorry,

280
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,094
that was
an inappropriate touch.

281
00:25:30,126 --> 00:25:34,164
That's inappropriate
touching when you're choking.

282
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,936
That was a fast tap,

283
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,136
I'm sorry.

284
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,772
Okay, don't tap my ass.

285
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,707
It just seemed like...

286
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,275
-In the center here.
-Okay.

287
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:46,711
And then you're gonna,
like, do a hug motion.

288
00:25:46,743 --> 00:25:48,078
-It's a hug?
-Yeah.

289
00:25:48,112 --> 00:25:49,314
Okay.

290
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:51,048
-So, like that,
-yeah, yeah.

291
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,117
-And this one comes over the back.
-Yeah.

292
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,797
And you're gonna hold
this nook in there.

293
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:57,121
This? Yeah. Yeah.

294
00:25:57,153 --> 00:25:58,355
And it's like you hug.

295
00:25:58,388 --> 00:26:00,157
Okay. I prefer
regular hugging.

296
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,026
Hug, hug.

297
00:26:02,058 --> 00:26:04,127
-Okay.
-Come on, stop being a pussy.

298
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:06,730
There you go.

299
00:26:06,763 --> 00:26:08,932
Whatever.
I don't think that can work again.

300
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:43,668
Trust no one.

301
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:45,937
Trust was no longer
an option

302
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,838
once we discovered them.

303
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:53,144
They were at Jericho.

304
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:56,013
They surrounded
the temple of Solomon.

305
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,016
They were at golgotha.

306
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,153
They were once few.

307
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:04,788
Now they are everywhere.

308
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:07,758
Their disguises
have begun to fail.

309
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:10,928
This is how we know
they must strike soon.

310
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:15,432
Even before you were
one of the blessed

311
00:27:15,465 --> 00:27:17,334
who could sense them,

312
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:21,004
you knew
they were out there.

313
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,009
Suddenly,
they were right next to you.

314
00:27:26,477 --> 00:27:30,281
That is not a soldier
with a gun.

315
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:32,717
That is evil.

316
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,420
That is not
your co-worker.

317
00:27:35,452 --> 00:27:37,721
That is a demon.

318
00:27:37,755 --> 00:27:40,692
That is not a human,
not a neighbor,

319
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:43,160
not a friend, not a lover,

320
00:27:43,193 --> 00:27:47,731
a brother, a mother,
a father, a wife.

321
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:50,368
That is a monster.

322
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:52,336
That is your enemy.

323
00:27:52,368 --> 00:27:55,706
And that is what you must
be ready to destroy.

324
00:28:18,394 --> 00:28:19,896
You all right?
What happened?

325
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,766
I just went
and saw a family friend,

326
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,935
but he wasn't around
anymore.

327
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,438
I have an awesome
evening planned for us.

328
00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:31,275
Talked to my boss about you.
But everything sounds okay.

329
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:32,910
And everything's
going okay with Mara,

330
00:28:32,942 --> 00:28:34,244
and if I don't
do something physical,

331
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:36,213
I'm gonna explode.

332
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:41,219
I can get you
a new one.

333
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:42,452
That's fine,
I have like five.

334
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:45,022
Are you ready
to get demolished?

335
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:47,424
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

336
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:50,094
Come on, I'm gonna beat you
for the first time.

337
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:52,296
You know, I just used
to get pushed around at work,

338
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:55,232
and then I just
started to dominate,

339
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,034
and now
it's all happening.

340
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:59,202
-Dominate?
-Yeah.

341
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:02,907
You have no idea what it's like
not to feel like a wuss anymore.

342
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,909
Alley oop!

343
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:08,846
Nice.

344
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:22,093
You believe
in supernatural stuff?

345
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,461
You trying to distract me?

346
00:29:23,493 --> 00:29:25,863
Yeah, puffy jacket my ass.

347
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:32,136
Has anything really scary
ever happened to you?

348
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:37,040
No.

349
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:44,281
Like, you ever been
in a fight?

350
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,350
You ever been mugged?

351
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:49,252
Nope.

352
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:52,791
Not very manly.

353
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,894
If something really scary was
happening, would you be on my side?

354
00:29:57,928 --> 00:30:00,198
Look, man, I'm trying to make up
for ten years of losing to you.

355
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,835
-I can bench 250 now. I'm different.
-Really?

356
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:05,936
Look, if you're trying to ask me,
if someone pulled a gun on me,

357
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,605
would I stand up
and be a hero? Yeah.

358
00:30:07,637 --> 00:30:09,240
I think the new me would.
I've changed.

359
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:10,507
-I'm different.
-Okay.

360
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,042
Okay.

361
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:14,979
Hey, I saw you
on the phone last night

362
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:18,115
at like 4:00 A.M.
outside.

363
00:30:24,888 --> 00:30:26,456
Just bullshit.

364
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,070
So you wanna go out?

365
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,239
Could I wear
different jeans?

366
00:30:44,074 --> 00:30:46,911
Remember when
we played blobbie wars?

367
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:49,213
God, we were lame.

368
00:30:52,316 --> 00:30:54,251
So, we going out?

369
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,019
Yeah.

370
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:02,427
Blobbie.

371
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,000
It didn't really work.

372
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:11,301
-I mean, I had fun.
-I know, why didn't it work?

373
00:31:11,335 --> 00:31:13,403
-I just...
-blobbies was my favorite.

374
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:14,971
How much am I winning by?

375
00:31:15,005 --> 00:31:17,141
Except for
I think you're losing.

376
00:31:17,173 --> 00:31:19,977
That doesn't count, cause look,
look at how my gauntlet is. See?

377
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:22,346
-This is your stupid gauntlet!
-If you catch it in the gauntlet,

378
00:31:22,378 --> 00:31:24,447
-It doesn't count.
-I don't care about your gauntlet.

379
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,018
Look at this, anything you catch
in the gauntlet doesn't count.

380
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,618
That's what I thought.
That's what I thought.

381
00:31:28,652 --> 00:31:31,389
Don't use that voice.

382
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,958
You know
I don't like that voice.

383
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,992
Fine. All right,
I'll take off the gauntlet.

384
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:38,596
God, I just...
I am chivalrous.

385
00:31:38,628 --> 00:31:40,697
I am.
Don't laugh at me.

386
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,201
-Uzi's.
-None of that.

387
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:46,002
I can say only
half of these count.

388
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:49,039
Do you think girls
are just better at stuff?

389
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,442
No, man.
Guys are better.

390
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:54,144
It's like...

391
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:57,181
I'm gonna crash here.

392
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:01,920
Wyatt.

393
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,355
This is it.
This is the best way to...

394
00:32:10,426 --> 00:32:12,329
You'll like it.

395
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,065
-I think you will.
-Do you wanna have kids?

396
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,038
I wanna have, like,
a million kids.

397
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:53,063
Hello, again, Wyatt.

398
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:55,500
I assume by now
that you know who I am.

399
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:00,738
We believe the monsters
are uniquely vulnerable

400
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,206
to acid.

401
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,211
Our spies think the war
will begin very soon now.

402
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:11,214
If you ever hear three claps
of thunder in a clear sky,

403
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:13,317
the war has begun.

404
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:17,087
Now is the time
to prepare mentally.

405
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,389
To kill a monster is easy.

406
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:21,658
To kill a monster
who looks like a friend,

407
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:24,829
or a harmless innocent...

408
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:27,865
Wyatt,
is there something else

409
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:29,467
in the basement with...

410
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:25,815
Hey.

411
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:28,452
It's me, Christian.
Stop.

412
00:36:32,688 --> 00:36:35,391
Got you.

413
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:37,394
Yeah.

414
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:49,340
I can't tell
if I'm hung-over or drunk.

415
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,242
I thought someone
was in the house.

416
00:36:54,878 --> 00:36:56,881
Okay.

417
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:01,718
Nightmare...

418
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:04,621
It must have been serious.

419
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:08,292
-Hit me one.
-No.

420
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:15,565
God.

421
00:37:17,534 --> 00:37:19,403
-Come on.
-That'II... that'll wake you up.

422
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:21,639
Whatever. You suck.

423
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:36,853
My junior year roommate Asa
used to get these night terrors,

424
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,589
and I remember
his girlfriend Becky

425
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:40,590
would always
be wrestling with him

426
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:43,059
in the bunk beneath mine.
And one night,

427
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:46,429
she literally had to punch him
in the face to wake him up.

428
00:37:46,463 --> 00:37:49,833
When he did,
he was like, "sorry.

429
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:52,469
I was battling the York."

430
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:01,811
What were you battling?

431
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:12,656
I don't remember.

432
00:38:21,664 --> 00:38:24,067
I have to get ready
for work.

433
00:38:25,434 --> 00:38:28,371
-Blobbies.
-I won.

434
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:38,047
There may be
a promotion today,

435
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:41,018
if I can conquer
this meeting.

436
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,519
Good news for both
of us tonight.

437
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:45,088
Cool, I'll clean up.

438
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:47,857
Where is it at?
Don't worry about it.

439
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:49,360
Just chill.

440
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:31,782
You are a mountain.

441
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:34,318
You are a hundred miles high.

442
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:52,302
Hey there.

443
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:53,869
Gerald running late?

444
00:42:53,902 --> 00:42:55,738
Yeah.

445
00:42:55,771 --> 00:42:59,041
I am stuck with you.

446
00:42:59,074 --> 00:43:03,312
-How are you?
-Fine. What's wrong?

447
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:07,284
Nothing, um...

448
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:09,619
I'm not moving into design,
and that's okay.

449
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:11,253
Look, I'll talk to Gerald,
it's cool.

450
00:43:11,286 --> 00:43:13,322
Well, people...
People are getting...

451
00:43:13,356 --> 00:43:15,125
I am sure
it's not your fault.

452
00:43:15,157 --> 00:43:17,661
-Don't worry about it.
-You're being let go.

453
00:43:17,693 --> 00:43:20,197
It's... what?

454
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:24,001
-Look at your face.
-You're being let go today.

455
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,905
You've worked here for seven
years, and they like you,

456
00:43:28,938 --> 00:43:30,740
but they're killing off
half your department,

457
00:43:30,773 --> 00:43:32,141
it has nothing
to do with...

458
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:33,777
With anything.

459
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:43,253
No one else is leaving?

460
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:45,889
They want you to remove
your stuff within the hour.

461
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,865
Okay. Yeah.

462
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:57,835
-Hold on.
-No, it's... okay.

463
00:44:02,271 --> 00:44:04,674
-Look...
-cool, maybe later.

464
00:44:29,032 --> 00:44:31,168
You are a flash
of lightning

465
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:35,172
in the darkness
of night.

466
00:44:35,204 --> 00:44:38,307
Hang on. Let's flip
the piece of paper.

467
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,443
It's nice.

468
00:44:40,476 --> 00:44:42,945
Okay,
this is so silly.

469
00:44:42,978 --> 00:44:46,048
This is gonna help me at work
to stand up for myself more,

470
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:48,117
-hearing your voice.
-Okay.

471
00:44:49,152 --> 00:44:52,054
Okay.

472
00:44:52,088 --> 00:44:54,157
Besides,
I'm gonna be a dad,

473
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,460
so, you know,
I need to have a real job.

474
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:07,504
Do you have
sulfuric acid?

475
00:45:07,536 --> 00:45:09,872
Yeah, down the left aisle.

476
00:45:09,905 --> 00:45:11,942
What happens if you get it
on your face?

477
00:45:11,974 --> 00:45:13,976
It would probably
burn your face off.

478
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,746
You don't wanna
have it on there.

479
00:45:33,096 --> 00:45:35,364
Wyatt?

480
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:46,309
Yeah.

481
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,081
-Yeah.
-What's wrong with your phone?

482
00:45:51,114 --> 00:45:53,282
I tried calling you like 20 times.
I was worried about you.

483
00:45:53,315 --> 00:45:55,384
Sorry, I dropped
my cell on the sidewalk.

484
00:45:55,418 --> 00:45:56,608
I think I broke it.

485
00:45:56,609 --> 00:45:58,989
It smells absolutely
terrible down here.

486
00:45:59,021 --> 00:46:01,824
-How was work?
-Fine.

487
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:03,293
What are you doing?

488
00:46:03,326 --> 00:46:05,128
It's just some stuff
from the old job.

489
00:46:05,161 --> 00:46:06,929
I thought maybe
I could sell it.

490
00:46:06,963 --> 00:46:08,832
-Old tools.
-That's great.

491
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:16,005
I lost my job.

492
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:22,913
You wanna grab
something to eat?

493
00:46:22,945 --> 00:46:24,514
There's something
I wanna talk to you about.

494
00:46:29,885 --> 00:46:30,920
Hello.

495
00:46:32,889 --> 00:46:34,891
It's probably just someone
pushing all the buttons.

496
00:46:34,923 --> 00:46:36,525
Does that happen a lot?

497
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:38,428
What do you want
to talk to me about?

498
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:46,303
It's Mara.

499
00:46:46,335 --> 00:46:48,404
Stop it.

500
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,006
Are you gonna leave
her out there?

501
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:51,942
Yes, I'm gonna
leave her out there.

502
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,878
Hey.

503
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:57,079
-Hi.
-Sorry I didn't hear. Did you buzz?

504
00:46:57,112 --> 00:46:58,380
Yeah, no. Sorry.

505
00:46:58,414 --> 00:46:59,883
I was just in
the neighborhood.

506
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:02,619
Hi, Wyatt.

507
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:05,021
Hey.

508
00:47:05,054 --> 00:47:08,157
I found this

509
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,259
because I forgot
to throw it away.

510
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,505
Cool. I'll need it,
is what you're saying?

511
00:47:26,442 --> 00:47:28,110
Okay, I should...
I should go.

512
00:47:31,347 --> 00:47:36,186
I'm sorry. Can you... do you
want to come in for a second?

513
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:44,560
Just a second. Okay.

514
00:47:44,594 --> 00:47:47,329
-Okay.
-It's disgusting.

515
00:47:47,362 --> 00:47:48,431
Yeah.

516
00:47:48,463 --> 00:47:50,933
It's really healthy.

517
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,478
My god.

518
00:48:04,614 --> 00:48:06,316
Dude.

519
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:08,351
What's your favorite... what?

520
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:11,021
It's...
It's really lame.

521
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,023
It's...

522
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,391
Well, I mean, hopefully if they
follow the Isaac Asimov rules,

523
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,294
then everything
would be okay,

524
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,930
but that, that requires that we
actually program them properly.

525
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:21,498
But anyway, let's stop
talking about this.

526
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:23,400
Because I'm...
Enough, enough.

527
00:48:23,432 --> 00:48:25,068
That's your favorite novel?

528
00:48:25,101 --> 00:48:28,405
That or
"lord of the rings" tied.

529
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:33,943
I don't know what
you're talking about.

530
00:48:33,976 --> 00:48:36,346
Why anything
that isn't black tea?

531
00:48:36,378 --> 00:48:39,382
Okay, hold on. I know this
amazing place on Norman

532
00:48:39,414 --> 00:48:41,117
that has incredible tea.

533
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,720
Plus it comes
in a fancy tin.

534
00:48:43,753 --> 00:48:45,188
I'll go get it, okay?

535
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:47,056
It doesn't matter.

536
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,226
You need to go?

537
00:48:50,259 --> 00:48:52,329
No.

538
00:48:56,164 --> 00:48:58,701
-Cool.
-Okay.

539
00:49:02,505 --> 00:49:04,507
Is Sandy okay?

540
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:06,976
She asked
about you actually.

541
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,046
She's different
than you might think.

542
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,516
Awkward.

543
00:49:13,548 --> 00:49:17,253
Hey, I got a phone message
the other day from someone.

544
00:49:17,286 --> 00:49:18,989
At first
I didn't know who it was.

545
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:20,489
Weird.

546
00:49:20,523 --> 00:49:22,659
You don't know
who that could be, right?

547
00:49:22,692 --> 00:49:25,528
I don't think it was her.

548
00:49:30,365 --> 00:49:32,601
This is gonna sound
weird, but...

549
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:35,238
Do you ever hear
anything that's not there?

550
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:44,313
Actually, I do.

551
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:46,449
I get kind of a choir.

552
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:48,418
It comes and goes,
just a couple times a week.

553
00:49:49,684 --> 00:49:51,653
It's a neurological thing.

554
00:49:51,686 --> 00:49:54,391
My mom had it too,
except for her, it's jazz

555
00:49:54,423 --> 00:49:57,192
that she just
couldn't switch off.

556
00:49:57,226 --> 00:50:02,632
She, she thought it was, um,
some annoying, angelic jazz band

557
00:50:02,664 --> 00:50:07,137
but I think it's just
my brain playing tricks.

558
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:11,041
Besides, if it was angels,
they'd be in tune.

559
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:12,307
You have perfect pitch?

560
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,476
Maybe. Sing something.

561
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:17,614
"B" flat.

562
00:50:17,646 --> 00:50:19,750
I just made that up.

563
00:50:24,753 --> 00:50:28,157
Hey, has Christian ever showed
you the roof, or the basement?

564
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,393
They're pretty cool.

565
00:50:30,425 --> 00:50:33,663
-Really?
-Yeah.

566
00:50:33,695 --> 00:50:36,432
You want to check them out,
instead of awkwardly waiting?

567
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:46,043
Okay.

568
00:50:46,876 --> 00:50:49,278
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

569
00:50:56,418 --> 00:50:57,820
Neato.

570
00:51:00,523 --> 00:51:02,225
We're safe down here.

571
00:51:02,257 --> 00:51:03,559
You guys could start
a band down here.

572
00:51:03,592 --> 00:51:04,860
I've been getting
the supplies,

573
00:51:04,893 --> 00:51:09,164
just like you said
to in your messages.

574
00:51:09,197 --> 00:51:11,500
Um, should, should
we check out the roof?

575
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:13,436
No. They can't
hear us down here.

576
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:18,275
Where are they?

577
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:24,114
-Um...
-How do they infect us?

578
00:51:24,146 --> 00:51:27,217
I know that you said
they're vulnerable to acid.

579
00:51:29,351 --> 00:51:31,187
I got sulfuric.

580
00:51:33,722 --> 00:51:36,326
You're acting really weird.

581
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:43,333
Okay.

582
00:51:43,365 --> 00:51:48,637
Just tell me,
when is it gonna happen?

583
00:52:00,483 --> 00:52:01,851
-I'm leaving.
-I need help.

584
00:52:01,884 --> 00:52:03,786
Move before
I hurt you, Wyatt.

585
00:52:34,717 --> 00:52:37,554
Mara had to leave.

586
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:40,190
Don't worry about it.

587
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,563
Okay.

588
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,367
What happened?

589
00:52:52,367 --> 00:52:54,837
Okay, let me take
off my jacket.

590
00:53:03,945 --> 00:53:05,480
Wyatt, this...

591
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,624
Okay.

592
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,260
-Okay?
-Okay.

593
00:53:59,902 --> 00:54:02,472
Wyatt, what happened
with Mara?

594
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:05,375
You need to toughen up.

595
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,905
-Okay. Hang on.
-I knew this act of yours was bullshit.

596
00:54:36,938 --> 00:54:40,643
-The new you, you're fucking pathetic.
-I'm fucking pathetic?

597
00:54:40,675 --> 00:54:42,811
-Look at you.
-Wake up. This is real!

598
00:54:50,652 --> 00:54:53,355
Do you have any idea
what they can do to you?

599
00:54:55,657 --> 00:54:56,992
Do you think this is easy?

600
00:54:57,025 --> 00:54:59,928
You fucking pussy.

601
00:55:01,664 --> 00:55:02,932
Come on.

602
00:57:03,885 --> 00:57:06,588
You're too late,
soft boy.

603
00:57:09,724 --> 00:57:13,028
Know that you cannot fight us.

604
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:14,730
You can feel us
already, can't you?

605
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,132
Inside your skull.

606
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:22,704
We believe
you are special.

607
00:57:22,737 --> 00:57:24,706
We need the soft ones,

608
00:57:24,739 --> 00:57:27,743
and you are the softest
we have found.

609
00:57:29,177 --> 00:57:32,949
When we pull you
and your friend apart

610
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:34,184
ventricle by ventricle

611
00:57:35,717 --> 00:57:39,254
and spread you out
like a soft red tree,

612
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:43,592
perhaps we will see

613
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,896
why even when you
had the chance,

614
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:50,800
so many people
did so little to stop us.

615
00:57:52,166 --> 00:57:54,170
I love you, Wyatt.

616
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:37,079
So, I'm thinking about
inventing this food

617
00:58:37,112 --> 00:58:38,847
that's literally
just balls of bacon

618
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,882
that you eat
with your hands.

619
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:43,686
Can you just slice
some cheddar?

620
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:47,956
I knew I got my ax
for a reason.

621
00:58:53,628 --> 00:58:57,232
So I would get these

622
00:58:57,266 --> 00:59:00,103
phone messages at night.

623
00:59:03,771 --> 00:59:06,976
You know,
it was nightmares, I guess.

624
00:59:07,009 --> 00:59:09,612
I got one last night,
but I hung up.

625
00:59:13,748 --> 00:59:16,184
Is that pancake mix, too?

626
00:59:16,217 --> 00:59:18,820
So, last year
I tried to kill myself,

627
00:59:18,853 --> 00:59:20,789
and I went to talk
to this guy,

628
00:59:20,822 --> 00:59:22,257
just one time,

629
00:59:22,291 --> 00:59:24,160
and I called him
about you.

630
00:59:27,862 --> 00:59:29,764
He's awesome.

631
00:59:29,797 --> 00:59:32,867
He has a parrot
in his office.

632
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,303
When do I see him?

633
00:59:35,336 --> 00:59:37,206
Tomorrow.

634
00:59:39,141 --> 00:59:40,677
Make sure you wear
a straightjacket.

635
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:47,883
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

636
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:52,922
One matching luxury axe,

637
00:59:52,954 --> 00:59:57,594
and vintage hatchet set.

638
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,329
That's good.

639
01:00:01,929 --> 01:00:05,233
All-American.
Hold on a sec.

640
01:00:05,266 --> 01:00:06,969
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

641
01:00:07,001 --> 01:00:09,404
-Then why did you buy them?
-It just turned out

642
01:00:09,438 --> 01:00:12,842
the project I needed them
for didn't happen, so.

643
01:00:14,976 --> 01:00:20,382
I just want to make sure that
Christian and Mara can be okay.

644
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:24,086
And I'm leaving tomorrow so...

645
01:00:35,963 --> 01:00:37,232
Look at me.

646
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:39,769
I'm Sandy I almost died.

647
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,438
And now I got
a pillow on my neck.

648
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:46,775
Is that supposed to be funny
Wyatt, or psycho Wyatt?

649
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,110
I know Mara
has her own thing,

650
01:00:48,143 --> 01:00:49,811
but she really liked
your stupid buddy.

651
01:00:49,844 --> 01:00:51,279
Yeah, he likes her too.

652
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:52,748
What was it, anyway?

653
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:53,983
CIA tapping your brain?

654
01:00:54,016 --> 01:00:55,751
You got bugs
under your skin?

655
01:00:55,784 --> 01:00:57,452
-It wasn't... it was nothing.
-Killing zombies?

656
01:00:57,485 --> 01:00:59,821
Were they
cloning you, Wyatt?

657
01:00:59,855 --> 01:01:00,464
It was nothing.

658
01:01:00,465 --> 01:01:02,291
Come on, you don't have to
be a bitch, just tell me.

659
01:01:02,324 --> 01:01:03,901
Like, what, what the
fuck was that about?

660
01:01:03,902 --> 01:01:04,427
I thought...

661
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,929
-I mean, just tell me.
-I thought people were turning evil.

662
01:01:06,961 --> 01:01:09,097
If you ever
do anything like that

663
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:10,298
to a friend of mine ever again,

664
01:01:10,331 --> 01:01:12,902
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

665
01:01:17,806 --> 01:01:20,208
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

666
01:01:23,778 --> 01:01:25,681
You probably should.

667
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,159
Hi.

668
01:02:10,192 --> 01:02:11,894
Don't be scared.

669
01:02:11,927 --> 01:02:14,530
Touch me, and I will rip
your face out of your spine.

670
01:02:14,563 --> 01:02:15,653
I just wanted to say...

671
01:02:15,654 --> 01:02:17,833
What? Sorry for taking
you to a rapey basement?

672
01:02:17,865 --> 01:02:19,201
No, no, no. It's not what
you thought.

673
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:21,036
-Christian's a really good guy.
-Let me guess.

674
01:02:21,068 --> 01:02:22,871
You two are really
super nice guys,

675
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,940
and you're just going
through some stuff right now.

676
01:02:24,972 --> 01:02:27,842
It's not Christian's fault.
I've been messing up his life,

677
01:02:27,876 --> 01:02:28,921
and it's not his fault.

678
01:02:28,922 --> 01:02:31,013
It's his fault for
having a friend like you.

679
01:02:31,045 --> 01:02:34,483
And tell him that it wasn't
a seven, it was a three.

680
01:02:36,217 --> 01:02:37,920
Mara, wait.

681
01:02:41,923 --> 01:02:43,391
God damn it.

682
01:02:45,092 --> 01:02:47,797
I'm sorry.

683
01:02:47,829 --> 01:02:49,398
Please don't die.

684
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:54,169
Do you need
to call an ambulance?

685
01:02:54,202 --> 01:02:55,237
Can you tell?

686
01:02:59,007 --> 01:03:02,144
Come on.

687
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:08,083
Okay, come on.
It's freezing.

688
01:03:08,115 --> 01:03:11,420
My nose.
No.

689
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:15,557
So, it's like some sort
of anti-zombie bunker.

690
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:17,326
-I get it.
-Really?

691
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:19,061
No.

692
01:04:35,103 --> 01:04:37,907
Pack your bags.
Let's get out of the city.

693
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,909
I got a car.

694
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:43,177
We'll go up to some
cabin somewhere,

695
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:46,147
maybe up north
by a lake.

696
01:04:46,181 --> 01:04:47,949
What about your appointment?

697
01:04:47,983 --> 01:04:49,685
I called. It's...
I'm down for next week.

698
01:04:49,717 --> 01:04:51,920
They just told me
to avoid alcohol.

699
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:56,358
-What are you doing?
-Signing up for the army.

700
01:04:56,391 --> 01:04:59,028
-Nice.
-Yeah.

701
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,130
I kinda figured if anyone
ever put a gun in my face,

702
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:03,231
I'd probably just piss
myself and start crying.

703
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,369
I'd like to change
that permanently.

704
01:05:07,402 --> 01:05:09,170
Yeah, why don't you think
about what a little?

705
01:05:09,204 --> 01:05:11,340
Fuck you.

706
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:17,680
Come on.
It'll be great.

707
01:05:24,686 --> 01:05:26,956
Be careful.

708
01:05:42,536 --> 01:05:46,375
You're seeing him again,
aren't you?

709
01:05:46,407 --> 01:05:48,676
No, man.

710
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:52,181
No weapons. See?

711
01:05:52,213 --> 01:05:55,384
I'm not killing anyone.

712
01:05:55,416 --> 01:05:57,519
No worries.

713
01:06:02,157 --> 01:06:04,660
Tell me what to do
to help fight him.

714
01:06:09,463 --> 01:06:10,666
I don't believe
what you believe,

715
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:12,300
but I know
you believe it.

716
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:16,372
So just be honest
with me,

717
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:20,342
and you have to promise me
not to kill anyone, okay?

718
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:22,978
-Don't mess with me.
-I'm not.

719
01:06:32,653 --> 01:06:35,023
There's a battle
happening...

720
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,295
Tonight.

721
01:06:41,496 --> 01:06:45,434
At 6:00,
gives us 40 minutes.

722
01:06:45,467 --> 01:06:47,737
Let's do this noise.

723
01:06:50,704 --> 01:06:52,641
-Grab your clothes.
-Okay.

724
01:06:52,673 --> 01:06:54,442
Grab your,
grab your boots.

725
01:06:54,476 --> 01:06:56,644
-Grab weapons.
-Yeah. Pack for the apocalypse,

726
01:06:56,677 --> 01:06:57,712
got it.

727
01:06:57,746 --> 01:06:59,514
-We got it.
-We gotta...

728
01:06:59,547 --> 01:07:01,449
I'm excited.

729
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,653
Where are we going?

730
01:07:05,686 --> 01:07:07,288
To parents' place
in north Carolina.

731
01:07:07,322 --> 01:07:08,824
It starts in the city,
so we have to get out,

732
01:07:08,856 --> 01:07:10,559
and meet them,
and we have to protect them.

733
01:07:10,592 --> 01:07:14,063
They don't live
down there anymore.

734
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:15,731
Mom's in Canada.

735
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,516
You got the keys?

736
01:07:54,235 --> 01:07:56,404
Hey, Wyatt,
where'd you get this car?

737
01:08:11,418 --> 01:08:13,654
-Get back inside.
-Why?

738
01:08:13,688 --> 01:08:17,326
Because it's starting early.

739
01:08:29,604 --> 01:08:31,740
Give me your cell phone.

740
01:08:31,773 --> 01:08:34,208
We can be safe
down here.

741
01:08:34,242 --> 01:08:36,744
We just have to keep our heads, and
be ready for them if they find us.

742
01:08:36,778 --> 01:08:38,646
-I blacked out the windows.
-Tell me what you saw.

743
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,882
What made you sure
this time?

744
01:08:39,914 --> 01:08:41,416
I would love
to explain everything,

745
01:08:41,448 --> 01:08:44,319
but we don't have time.

746
01:08:47,689 --> 01:08:51,326
Hey. Tell me.

747
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,496
I went to go see
Mara for you.

748
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:55,831
They got to her.

749
01:08:55,863 --> 01:08:57,532
She turned
into an alien?

750
01:08:57,565 --> 01:09:00,402
Mara was good,
but it's like an infection

751
01:09:00,435 --> 01:09:02,704
that comes in through
your eyes or your ears.

752
01:09:02,737 --> 01:09:03,872
And then goes
to your brain.

753
01:09:03,904 --> 01:09:05,806
It's not peoples' fault.

754
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,676
What'd you see?

755
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:12,347
What'd you see?

756
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:20,655
Her face started twisting, and then
her smile started spreading out

757
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:22,724
farther than
a smile's supposed to,

758
01:09:22,756 --> 01:09:25,193
all the way
past her ears.

759
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:28,497
And then her head
split in two,

760
01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:31,332
and there was
this thing there.

761
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,373
You know what I thought?
That we're all alone.

762
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:45,681
You hurt her?

763
01:09:45,713 --> 01:09:47,716
I made it back
and found you.

764
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:54,323
When's this thing start?

765
01:09:55,422 --> 01:09:56,858
Six minutes.

766
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:58,859
Let's sing a song.

767
01:10:43,771 --> 01:10:46,007
Christian.
Stop, please.

768
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:50,613
Can you take off
the mask?

769
01:10:57,585 --> 01:11:00,822
You want me to be honest?

770
01:11:00,854 --> 01:11:03,458
You think I'm one of them.

771
01:11:07,761 --> 01:11:10,331
-Tie me up.
-Why would you want me...

772
01:11:10,364 --> 01:11:12,567
Because, yes, it's really
scary to trust you right now,

773
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,538
but that's what this is,
so, trust me

774
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:19,475
because I trust you.

775
01:11:22,844 --> 01:11:24,712
Okay.

776
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:44,466
Christian, they take over
your mind with their eyes,

777
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:51,472
and maybe their voice.

778
01:11:51,506 --> 01:11:54,776
How much longer?

779
01:11:54,809 --> 01:11:56,778
Four minutes.

780
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:59,947
Go for it.

781
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:02,016
Open wide.

782
01:12:21,536 --> 01:12:23,105
You okay?

783
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:49,898
Sorry.

784
01:12:55,036 --> 01:12:57,005
It's okay.

785
01:13:16,824 --> 01:13:18,626
Please, stop.

786
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:29,171
Wyatt?

787
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,675
Wyatt?

788
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:37,112
Sulfuric acid.

789
01:15:20,213 --> 01:15:23,618
Trust no one.

790
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:26,555
Even before
you were one of the blessed,

791
01:15:26,587 --> 01:15:28,222
you could sense them.

792
01:15:28,256 --> 01:15:33,295
You knew
they were out there.

793
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:35,197
Suddenly,
they were right next to you.

794
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:43,204
That is not a soldier,
with a gun.

795
01:15:43,237 --> 01:15:46,574
That is evil.

796
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:49,277
That is not
your co-worker.

797
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,780
That is a demon.

798
01:15:53,847 --> 01:15:58,720
That is not a human,
not a neighbor,

799
01:15:58,752 --> 01:16:01,055
not a friend,
not a lover.

800
01:16:01,088 --> 01:16:05,993
A brother, mother,
a father, a wife.

801
01:16:07,628 --> 01:16:09,264
That is a monster.

802
01:16:10,797 --> 01:16:13,068
That is your enemy.

803
01:16:14,969 --> 01:16:19,942
And that is what
you must be ready to destroy.

804
01:17:25,206 --> 01:17:27,342
Well, I didn't piss
myself after all.

805
01:17:30,778 --> 01:17:33,682
Hey, it occurred to me
that we never hugged.
