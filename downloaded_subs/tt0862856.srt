1
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,968
<i>During the spookiest time of the year...</i>

2
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:40,910
<i>... there are a few guidelines
all ghosts and goblins should follow.</i>

3
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:43,072
<i>Always stay on sidewalks.</i>

4
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,448
<i>Never go to a stranger's house,
and never go out alone.</i>

5
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:11,500
This is a great idea, honey. Really.

6
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:13,472
It's just magical.

7
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:15,872
It makes me wish every night
was Halloween.

8
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,880
I'm sorry, Em.

9
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:20,811
- Wait, wait. Not yet.
- What?

10
00:01:20,988 --> 00:01:23,456
- You're supposed to keep it lit.
- Why?

11
00:01:23,624 --> 00:01:25,216
Ancient tradition?

12
00:01:25,392 --> 00:01:28,486
Henry, it's Halloween, not Hanukkah.

13
00:01:28,662 --> 00:01:30,823
- Baby, I'm lit and you're lit.
- But honey...

14
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:33,523
But our little friend here?
His night's over.

15
00:01:35,903 --> 00:01:37,666
You know, you should be more careful.

16
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:39,567
There are rules.
You might upset someone.

17
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,300
Oh, please. Who?

18
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:03,285
What?

19
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,491
Inside. Upstairs.

20
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,726
Let's just take all this crap down.
It looks like a crime scene.

21
00:02:08,902 --> 00:02:11,336
- I told you I'd do it in the morning.
- No, you won't.

22
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:14,804
You're gonna sleep until noon
and then play video games until 4.

23
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:18,604
And besides, my mom is coming and
she'll have an aneurysm if she sees this.

24
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:20,041
Really?

25
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:22,272
I'll do it.

26
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:34,384
Go inside. Put on the tape.

27
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:48,667
I hate Halloween.

28
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,677
What took you guys so long?

29
00:04:08,188 --> 00:04:09,553
Happy Halloween.

30
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:26,902
<i>Yeah! Oh, baby!</i>

31
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:32,978
Henry!

32
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:21,016
Emma?

33
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:40,786
<i>Werewolves, zombies
and demons of every variety.</i>

34
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,052
<i>They've all descended...</i>

35
00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:45,288
<i>... on the normally sleepy town
of Warren valley, Ohio...</i>

36
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:48,093
<i>... where the holiday
and all of its strange traditions...</i>

37
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:50,327
<i>... are taken very seriously.</i>

38
00:08:50,503 --> 00:08:54,234
<i>It's only 8:00 and the streets are already
packed with costumed visitors...</i>

39
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:56,637
<i>... some to show off, others to blend in...</i>

40
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,802
<i>... but all to celebrate the magical night
of Halloween...</i>

41
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:03,938
...the one night a year when we can pretend
to be the scariest thing we can think of.

42
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:12,682
I am not wearing this. It's too small.

43
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:14,918
- My tits keep popping out.
- That's the idea.

44
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:18,189
Don't know why we drove here
when there are guys in the city.

45
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:19,354
Fresh meat.

46
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:21,159
It's what we do every Halloween, Laurie.

47
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:22,801
Whatever happened to trick-or-treating?

48
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:24,960
Puberty.
Last year we were in Tampa.

49
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:26,298
And went as sexy nurses.

50
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:30,068
No, Janet, Tampa was two
years ago. I remember because you puked...

51
00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:31,710
...doing a guy in his pickup.

52
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:34,210
I ate some bad Mexican,
and it was a Jeep.

53
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:38,340
Last year was San Diego. We
dressed as sailors and ended up with sailors.

54
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:40,679
Yeah, and Maria's sailor was a girl.

55
00:09:40,854 --> 00:09:45,791
So what? She had a nice ass.
It all tastes the same to me anyway.

56
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,722
Ladies, there are children out here.

57
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:52,865
Okay, all of you come out
on the count of three. One, two, three.

58
00:09:58,671 --> 00:10:01,765
- Nice.
- Right.

59
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,474
- Laurie, come on out.
- No.

60
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:11,241
- Open up.
- No.

61
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:15,980
Open the door,
or we'll huff and we'll puff...

62
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:19,053
Come on, seriously, open up.

63
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:21,489
Fine, just don't laugh, okay?

64
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:34,939
Danielle, I look like I'm 5.

65
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:36,803
Shut up, you look great.

66
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:40,102
- It's tradition.
- Great.

67
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,738
- What does tradition say we do now?
- We meet our dates.

68
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:48,050
Two thirty-three, 30-D.

69
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:50,215
I mean, $234.33.

70
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:52,615
Thanks.

71
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:56,660
You know, this might sound kind of
forward, but well, we're just in town...

72
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,266
...for a party tonight, and I was wondering
what time you get off work.

73
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:04,933
In about 20 minutes, actually.

74
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:07,265
Yeah? You know
where Sheep's Meadow is?

75
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,737
Sure, yeah, of course.

76
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:11,206
All right. So why don't you
meet me there in 45?

77
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:14,579
Okay, I guess.

78
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:17,049
Don't forget your costume.

79
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:05,621
That can't be good
for your diabetes, Charlie.

80
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,825
Don't waste a good lie on this.

81
00:12:10,003 --> 00:12:11,493
It's just candy.

82
00:12:11,671 --> 00:12:13,639
Guess it's a good thing I got more.

83
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:16,206
Why don't you sit down,
stay for a minute?

84
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:19,641
- Oh, I can't. I have...
- Sit down, Charlie.

85
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,416
Your problem is simple.
You always wait for them to come to you.

86
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:28,782
If you just tried a little harder,
you wouldn't be a virgin at 22.

87
00:12:28,955 --> 00:12:30,582
What? Excuse me?

88
00:12:30,757 --> 00:12:33,624
It's practically stapled to your forehead.

89
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:36,227
Laurie, please,
do not listen to them, okay?

90
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:38,455
The key thing is to just be yourself.

91
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:41,462
Being myself hasn't gotten me very far.

92
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:45,035
Maybe I'm too old-fashioned, but I've
always wanted my first time to be...

93
00:12:45,204 --> 00:12:47,468
- No, please, don't say it.
- Special.

94
00:12:48,174 --> 00:12:51,701
Honey, listen, we've all been there,
but you can't hesitate.

95
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:54,346
Watch.

96
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:02,815
That's some big equipment
you've got there.

97
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,687
- Thank you.
- I'm Maria. This is Janet.

98
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,795
- And we have a small problem.
- Really?

99
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:13,694
We've got this great party to go to...

100
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,727
But we don't have any dates.

101
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:25,601
Here. Help yourself.

102
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:30,081
It's for the pumpkin, not you. Promise.

103
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:32,080
All of mine were dull.

104
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:43,961
Smashing jack-o'- lanterns?
Stealing candy?

105
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,861
It's okay. Believe it or not,
I was just like you when I was a kid.

106
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:50,728
Till my dad set me straight, that is.

107
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:55,363
See, my dad taught me
tonight is about respecting the dead...

108
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,704
...because this is the one night
that the dead...

109
00:13:58,878 --> 00:14:04,077
...and all sorts of other things roam free
and pay us a visit.

110
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:06,708
Sorry.

111
00:14:07,086 --> 00:14:09,020
All these traditions...

112
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:14,387
...jack-o'- lanterns, putting on costumes,
handing out treats...

113
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,758
...they were started to protect us,
but nowadays...

114
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:21,996
...no one really cares.

115
00:14:22,168 --> 00:14:23,897
Yeah.

116
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:27,966
I didn't do such a good job, did I?

117
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,232
What do you think?

118
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,769
Hey.

119
00:14:36,516 --> 00:14:38,211
You okay?

120
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:40,947
You need a root beer?

121
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,921
Oh, wait.

122
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:49,027
That's right. There's another tradition.

123
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:52,163
A very important one.

124
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:56,366
Always check your candy.

125
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:05,106
Trick or...

126
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,946
Ugh!

127
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,028
Trick or treat!

128
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:07,535
We know you're in there.
We can see you.

129
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,974
Hello!
Just a minute!

130
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:21,179
Wait. No, no. Shh!

131
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:26,524
Great costume, Mr. Wilkins.

132
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,060
Oy.

133
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,328
Oh, right, candy.

134
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:36,157
Thanks.

135
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:41,537
Principal Wilkins, do you think we might
be able to have your jack-o'- lantern, please?

136
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:47,407
- You're not gonna smash it, are you?
- No, it's a scavenger hunt for UNICEF.

137
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:50,772
Anything for a good cause.

138
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:59,121
Happy Halloween.

139
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:03,188
Yeah. Happy Halloween.

140
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:08,597
Didn't you get one?

141
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,077
Are you sure about this?

142
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,309
There's gotta be one or two
extra guys there.

143
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:29,249
- I could help you.
- Go. I'll meet you there.

144
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,347
Call me if you get into trouble.

145
00:17:31,524 --> 00:17:33,116
You're turning into Mom.

146
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:34,850
Ouch.

147
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:38,485
- Just remember to be yourself.
- But play hard to get.

148
00:17:38,664 --> 00:17:39,961
Goodbye, Danielle!

149
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:23,742
Happy Halloween.

150
00:18:30,249 --> 00:18:34,686
Daddy!
I'm back from trick-or-treating!

151
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:36,253
Billy. Shh.

152
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:38,890
- Please, be quiet.
- Why?

153
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:41,260
Because you'll bother the neighbors.

154
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:44,624
<i>Now go watch Charlie Brown
and I'll be in in a minute.</i>

155
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:49,393
- Charlie Brown's an asshole!
- Billy Wilkins. Language.

156
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:25,396
Wait, hold on.

157
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,765
Come on. There you...

158
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:37,409
Yeah.

159
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,881
Here you go. Go get it! Shit.

160
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:48,286
Spite!

161
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,663
Spite! Get your ass in here.

162
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:01,705
Are you finished crapping or what?

163
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,134
Who the hell is that?

164
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:09,739
I got an NRA membership in my pocket...

165
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:12,179
...and a shotgun over the fireplace,
so get out...

166
00:20:12,351 --> 00:20:14,649
It's me, Mr. Kreeg.

167
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,482
Steven. Steven Wilkins.

168
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:21,148
What in God's name are you doing
down there, Wilkins? Hiding bodies?

169
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:24,318
What did you say?

170
00:20:25,664 --> 00:20:26,722
Nothing.

171
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:29,367
The septic tank is acting up.

172
00:20:29,535 --> 00:20:32,436
- Is that what that smell is?
- I'm afraid so.

173
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:36,097
Then fix it!
It stinks like a dead whore out here.

174
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,141
I'm...

175
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:40,275
...trying.

176
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:43,682
Keep your kid out of my yard!

177
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:46,951
Goddamn freak.

178
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:51,952
- Happy Halloween.
- Screw you!

179
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:05,370
Daddy!

180
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:09,998
I wanna carve the jack-o'- lantern now,
but I need your help with the eyes.

181
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:11,643
In a minute, Billy.

182
00:21:12,411 --> 00:21:14,845
And can I go to the parade
with you later?

183
00:21:15,014 --> 00:21:17,539
No, Daddy has a date.

184
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:21,152
Oh! But we haven't done anything
fun together.

185
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,417
How about if we make some
caramel apples, just like Grandpa used to?

186
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:29,060
- How about that?
- When?

187
00:21:29,228 --> 00:21:34,894
After we carve the jack-o'- lantern,
but you have to be quiet.

188
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:36,295
Okay.

189
00:21:43,342 --> 00:21:46,573
But don't forget to help me
with the eyes!

190
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,890
"Daddy, I wanna carve a pumpkin."

191
00:22:04,063 --> 00:22:06,896
"Daddy, I wanna go to the parade."

192
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:10,399
"Daddy, I wish Mommy was still alive."

193
00:22:20,146 --> 00:22:24,048
Wilkins! Wilkins, over here! Wilkins!

194
00:22:24,216 --> 00:22:25,547
Help me, goddamn it!

195
00:22:26,318 --> 00:22:27,751
Help me!

196
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,821
- Help me!
- Screw you.

197
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:39,327
Billy!

198
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:55,846
Gotcha.

199
00:23:00,186 --> 00:23:02,120
So can we carve it now?

200
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,355
Yeah.

201
00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:08,854
Let's go downstairs.

202
00:24:09,388 --> 00:24:13,222
Let's carve a scary face this time.

203
00:24:14,193 --> 00:24:16,821
A scary face it is.

204
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:39,479
Wrap it around.

205
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:45,153
But don't forget to help me
with the eyes.

206
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,101
Trick or treat!

207
00:25:05,477 --> 00:25:08,275
Aren't you guys adorable?

208
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:12,543
Thanks, Mrs. Henderson.
That's a great costume.

209
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:17,712
I know. Isn't it just "purr-fect"?

210
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:23,217
You want a drink or something?
It'll be our little secret.

211
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:26,956
- Sure.
- No, thanks. But...

212
00:25:27,132 --> 00:25:29,464
All right, fine. I'll see what I got for you.

213
00:25:29,635 --> 00:25:34,197
Actually, Mrs. Henderson,
we were wondering if you might...

214
00:25:36,842 --> 00:25:38,742
- If you might...
- Holy shit.

215
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:42,677
...have a jack-o'- lantern we could borrow.

216
00:25:42,848 --> 00:25:45,078
Here you go.

217
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,810
Now, be safe...

218
00:25:49,188 --> 00:25:51,315
...and watch out for monsters.

219
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:55,889
I don't even know what that was.

220
00:25:56,061 --> 00:26:00,054
Coach Taylor was in a hot-dog costume
butt-fucking a pig.

221
00:26:00,232 --> 00:26:03,326
- I think. And then...
- Chip. Let's just not.

222
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:13,009
- Trick or treat.
- What'd you find?

223
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,606
That's it?

224
00:26:15,781 --> 00:26:18,841
Sorry, but some asshole went
down the street smashing all of them.

225
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:20,951
But we have three. Isn't this enough?

226
00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:23,281
Almost.

227
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,327
Macy, why didn't we just start here?

228
00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:35,990
I didn't know she'd do this.

229
00:26:38,036 --> 00:26:39,128
This is weird.

230
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:42,364
Is that Rhonda the retard?

231
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,668
She's not a retard, she's an idiot savant.

232
00:26:44,843 --> 00:26:46,435
Here she comes.

233
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:51,373
You're on, Schrader.

234
00:27:02,728 --> 00:27:04,855
Did you carve all these yourself?

235
00:27:05,898 --> 00:27:10,198
Yeah. Made my costume too.
Like it?

236
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:11,768
I do.

237
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:14,871
I'm Schrader.

238
00:27:15,574 --> 00:27:17,439
Rhonda.

239
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,403
Let's get another drink.

240
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:09,515
Henry.

241
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:14,992
- I need help.
- She's just drunk, baby. Come on.

242
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:16,955
You must really like Halloween.

243
00:30:17,122 --> 00:30:20,353
- You mean Samhain?
- What?

244
00:30:20,525 --> 00:30:24,518
Samhain, also known as All Hallows' Eve,
also known as Halloween.

245
00:30:24,696 --> 00:30:27,062
Pre-dating Christianity,
the Celtic holiday...

246
00:30:27,232 --> 00:30:30,201
...was celebrated on the one
night between autumn and winter...

247
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:33,065
...when the barrier between living
and dead was thinnest...

248
00:30:33,238 --> 00:30:37,231
...and often involved rituals
that included human sacrifice.

249
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,807
I like your eye patch.

250
00:31:13,478 --> 00:31:17,005
Great, a rock quarry.
Nice way to celebrate Halloween, Macy.

251
00:31:17,182 --> 00:31:20,242
- Why are we here?
- To pay our respects to the dead.

252
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:23,081
What happened? Did somebody die here?

253
00:31:23,255 --> 00:31:24,313
Wait.

254
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,082
Is this where...?

255
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:30,319
- It is, isn't it? This is where that school...
- Shut up, Sara.

256
00:31:30,495 --> 00:31:32,087
The Halloween School Bus Massacre.

257
00:31:32,264 --> 00:31:35,256
- Just don't call it that.
- What's she talking about?

258
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:37,766
It's this awesome town legend.
There was this bus...

259
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:40,496
Jesus, will you shut up
and let me tell the damn story?

260
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,801
You said a bad word.

261
00:31:49,347 --> 00:31:51,838
It happened 30 years ago...

262
00:31:52,017 --> 00:31:56,511
...on a late Halloween afternoon.

263
00:32:04,763 --> 00:32:07,630
<i>A school bus was on its usual route.</i>

264
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:12,393
<i>But this wasn't your typical school bus...</i>

265
00:32:12,904 --> 00:32:15,702
<i>... and they weren't your typical kids.</i>

266
00:32:21,947 --> 00:32:23,642
<i>There were eight of them...</i>

267
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:25,974
<i>... and they were different.</i>

268
00:32:26,585 --> 00:32:28,052
<i>Troubled.</i>

269
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,653
<i>Disturbed.</i>

270
00:32:31,523 --> 00:32:34,856
<i>Every day, parents put their dirty secrets
on this bus...</i>

271
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:37,290
<i>... to be driven to a school
miles outside of town.</i>

272
00:32:37,462 --> 00:32:40,863
3260.

273
00:32:41,032 --> 00:32:44,866
3264.

274
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:48,563
3266.

275
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:53,172
<i>But that day...</i>

276
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:57,010
<i>... the driver took a different route.</i>

277
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,253
Wrong way.

278
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:08,683
Wrong way.

279
00:33:16,034 --> 00:33:17,729
Wrong way.

280
00:33:18,103 --> 00:33:19,968
<i>And instead of
taking the students home...</i>

281
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:25,135
<i>... he drove the bus
to an abandoned rock quarry.</i>

282
00:33:26,444 --> 00:33:29,242
This rock quarry.

283
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:46,156
<i>The kids didn't know that over the years,
their parents had become exhausted...</i>

284
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:48,094
<i>... embarrassed.</i>

285
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:57,933
<i>And they were willing to do anything
to ease their burden.</i>

286
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:05,916
<i>So one day, the parents approached
the bus driver and made him an offer.</i>

287
00:34:14,926 --> 00:34:16,416
Shh.

288
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:21,191
<i>With the money they collected together,
they asked him to do the unthinkable.</i>

289
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:37,437
<i>It almost worked perfectly.</i>

290
00:34:38,884 --> 00:34:40,647
Wrong way.

291
00:34:41,887 --> 00:34:43,548
Wrong way.

292
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:49,692
Home. Home.

293
00:34:50,595 --> 00:34:51,687
I wanna go home.

294
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:55,690
I wanna go home.

295
00:35:02,974 --> 00:35:04,669
Home.

296
00:35:11,383 --> 00:35:13,214
Home. Home.

297
00:35:16,988 --> 00:35:19,252
Home! Go home!

298
00:35:21,393 --> 00:35:22,951
Home.

299
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:04,224
<i>The driver was never heard from again.</i>

300
00:36:21,753 --> 00:36:27,817
<i>As for the bus, some say
it sank so deep that it couldn't be found.</i>

301
00:36:27,993 --> 00:36:31,292
<i>Others say the town
just didn't want it to be found.</i>

302
00:36:32,697 --> 00:36:35,325
For all we know, it's still down there...

303
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:39,164
...and so are those kids.

304
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,242
You are so full of shit.

305
00:36:48,413 --> 00:36:49,880
Really?

306
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,879
Then I guess
you won't mind being first.

307
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,881
First what?

308
00:36:54,052 --> 00:36:57,783
Eight victims, eight jack-o'- lanterns...

309
00:36:58,156 --> 00:37:00,954
...each one representing a lost soul.

310
00:37:01,126 --> 00:37:04,061
So we're going to leave them
by the side of the lake...

311
00:37:04,229 --> 00:37:06,026
...as an offering to those who died.

312
00:37:35,493 --> 00:37:37,222
Is that one of yours?

313
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,091
Yes.

314
00:37:40,265 --> 00:37:41,789
It's very pretty.

315
00:37:43,034 --> 00:37:44,797
Thank you.

316
00:38:04,656 --> 00:38:07,591
It can only hold three safely.

317
00:38:08,526 --> 00:38:12,360
I'll send the keys back up.
You guys bring the rest.

318
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,361
Uh... Okay.

319
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,809
I can't do this.
If you put me in a box...

320
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,708
...it makes me feel like
you're not proud of me.

321
00:39:06,885 --> 00:39:09,012
If you're not proud of me...

322
00:39:09,854 --> 00:39:12,414
- Hello?
- Who's your favorite big sister?

323
00:39:17,228 --> 00:39:18,422
<i>You there?</i>

324
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:22,127
Yeah. Hi.

325
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,269
So there's a guy here
who really wants to meet you.

326
00:39:25,436 --> 00:39:26,960
Is he young? Cute?

327
00:39:28,706 --> 00:39:31,004
Uh... Yeah.
Yeah, no, you could say that.

328
00:39:31,176 --> 00:39:33,303
<i>He's really, really nice.</i>

329
00:39:33,478 --> 00:39:35,002
So he's hideous.

330
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:39,082
Just get your ass over here.
Beggars can't be choosers.

331
00:39:43,388 --> 00:39:44,582
Nice.

332
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,255
Great.

333
00:39:47,425 --> 00:39:49,086
Not now, Andrew.

334
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,558
- Josh.
- Whatever.

335
00:39:58,002 --> 00:39:59,993
Werewolves.

336
00:40:02,507 --> 00:40:03,997
Very funny.

337
00:40:17,889 --> 00:40:20,551
That bus is around here somewhere.
I think it's over here.

338
00:40:20,725 --> 00:40:24,092
Over where? I can't see shit
in this fog. Think I found a dead retard.

339
00:40:24,262 --> 00:40:26,856
That's me, asshole.
Like I said.

340
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:29,659
Both of you shut up and keep looking.

341
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:31,961
There's something moving by that rock.

342
00:40:32,136 --> 00:40:34,229
I can't see.
Jesus, what is that?

343
00:40:35,573 --> 00:40:36,597
Help me!

344
00:40:36,774 --> 00:40:39,538
Sara! Where's Sara?

345
00:40:40,712 --> 00:40:42,202
Run!

346
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,315
There's nowhere to go.
Up! I wanna go back up!

347
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:04,757
Macy? Schrader? Sara?

348
00:41:23,721 --> 00:41:27,020
Aren't you coming? Okay, stay here.

349
00:41:27,191 --> 00:41:30,683
Don't let the candles go out
and they'll protect you, okay?

350
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:38,782
Oh, shit.

351
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,412
Is she dead?

352
00:44:44,589 --> 00:44:46,056
Hey.

353
00:44:50,595 --> 00:44:52,358
Rhonda.

354
00:44:53,197 --> 00:44:54,960
Rhonda.

355
00:45:08,212 --> 00:45:10,077
It was all going so well.

356
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:15,113
- You're all dead!
- Rhonda, calm down.

357
00:45:15,286 --> 00:45:17,413
It was all just a trick.

358
00:45:17,588 --> 00:45:21,547
Look, none of this is real.
It was just a trick.

359
00:45:22,293 --> 00:45:25,285
- A bad joke.
- I'd say it was a pretty good one.

360
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,095
Shut up.

361
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:33,027
Here, let me see.

362
00:45:38,009 --> 00:45:39,738
Does it hurt?

363
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:50,351
- Go pack everything up. We're leaving.
- Says who?

364
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:54,821
Macy, she's scared out of her mind.
What else do you want?

365
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,861
Let's go.

366
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,893
This one's still lit.

367
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:21,335
If this was all a trick,
then how did the school bus get here?

368
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,879
- That part's true.
- What happened to the bus driver?

369
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:26,539
I don't know, Chip.

370
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:31,219
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

371
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,853
- I'm not in the mood.
- It wasn't me.

372
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,156
What is that?

373
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,570
- Schrader!
- Not again.

374
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:57,013
- Over here!
- Wait here.

375
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,416
Help us!

376
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:03,518
Schrader!

377
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,130
- Schrader!
- What the hell?

378
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,324
We have to go.
We have to get out of here.

379
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,298
- Calm down.
- We have to go!

380
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,732
- Look, Macy...
- Listen to me!

381
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,737
We heard voices.
There are other people here.

382
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:30,811
What is that?

383
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:56,969
Help me! Help me!

384
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:01,736
No. Run.

385
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,084
Rhonda, open the gate.

386
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,015
- Let us in, please!
- Open the gate!

387
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:13,180
Open the gate, please.

388
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,289
Come on.

389
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:28,262
Open the gate.

390
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,936
- No! Rhonda, look at me.
- What are you doing?

391
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,444
It's not a trick, it's real.

392
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:38,774
Come back!

393
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:43,642
Where is she going?
Rhonda!

394
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:45,789
- No, no!
- It's not a trick!

395
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,210
Help me, please!

396
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,565
I'm not in the mood,
so just come on out.

397
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,010
Oh, my God. She's so funny.

398
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,248
No, thanks.

399
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,225
She's a big girl.
She can take care of herself.

400
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,156
I wish that were true.

401
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,927
Mom always said
she was the runt of the litter.

402
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,202
My, my...

403
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,544
...what big eyes you have.

404
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:00,120
So where's this guy
you're setting her up with?

405
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,348
The nice one?

406
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:16,528
Laurie.

407
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,622
Oh, my God.

408
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,133
Please, help me.

409
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:09,086
There she is.

410
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:12,586
Laurie, what's going on?

411
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,594
You're late.

412
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:18,267
Sorry. It took longer than I thought.

413
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:20,902
What did he do to you?

414
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:25,731
I listened to their advice
and played hard to get. He bit me.

415
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:32,880
Well, at least you made it. Drink?

416
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,516
Sure.

417
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,517
Come here.

418
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,823
- Please.
- Say "ah."

419
00:52:57,074 --> 00:52:58,598
Not bad.

420
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,136
What's your name, honey?

421
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:07,147
Steven.

422
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,945
- Steven?
- Steven Wilkins.

423
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:14,216
I'm glad you're her first, I really am.
I like you.

424
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,653
Who are you people?

425
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,191
I'm nervous.

426
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:55,259
Hey.

427
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:58,660
You're gonna be fine.

428
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,196
Just be yourself.

429
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:24,218
It's my first time...

430
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,322
...so just bear with me.

431
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,677
What are you doing?

432
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,742
My, my...

433
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,721
...what big eyes you have.

434
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:44,121
Trick or treat.

435
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,297
<i>You push it in, you slide the food in.</i>

436
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:00,766
<i>It pops right out, okay?</i>

437
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:05,499
<i>I'm gonna take this device.
I've done it three times already, inside.</i>

438
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:08,644
<i>I'm gonna show the folks
how to put it on the spit rod.</i>

439
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:10,609
<i>It's so darn easy.</i>

440
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:14,944
<i>I take the meat, and all I'm gonna do
is just center it like this.</i>

441
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:16,278
<i>It goes down.</i>

442
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:20,318
<i>I'll put the wheel on.
It's as simple as this.</i>

443
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,254
<i>This is about a 7-pound
pork loin roast.</i>

444
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:28,329
<i>I'll put it in the machine, I'll slide it back,
put up the window.</i>

445
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:31,125
<i>- You set it, and?
- Forget it!</i>

446
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:34,634
<i>Right. I'm gonna go over
to the pork loin roast over here now...</i>

447
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:39,340
<i>... and I'm gonna take this one out.
This has been done...</i>

448
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:42,444
<i>It's only 8:00, and the streets
are packed with visitors...</i>

449
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,603
<i>... some to show off, others to blend in...</i>

450
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:47,443
<i>... but all to celebrate the magical night
of Halloween.</i>

451
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:58,923
<i>Baked goods and crops
were left out as offerings for the dead...</i>

452
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,063
<i>... a custom now known
as trick-or-treating.</i>

453
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:02,892
Christ.

454
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:05,034
<i>Revolutionary. Now look.</i>

455
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:09,035
<i>Let me just start cutting this over here
so that folks can see.</i>

456
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,830
<i>This beautiful? Look at this
over here, folks, huh?</i>

457
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,978
<i>Look how beautiful that pork looks
with all its injected flavors on the...</i>

458
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:01,519
Happy Halloween.

459
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,156
Spite?

460
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:09,095
Spite.

461
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:25,645
Spite. Get your ass in here.

462
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:35,356
Are you finished crapping or what?

463
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,720
Who the hell is that?

464
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,593
I've got an NRA membership
in my pocket...

465
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:49,067
...and a shotgun over the fireplace,
so get out of here before I...

466
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:52,003
It's me, Mr. Kreeg.

467
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:53,972
Steven. Steven Wilkins.

468
01:01:56,145 --> 01:02:00,673
What in God's name are you doing
down there, Wilkins? Hiding bodies?

469
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:06,483
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

470
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:08,657
The septic tank is acting up.

471
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,258
Well, fix it!

472
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:12,690
It stinks like a dead whore out here.

473
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:16,059
I'm trying.

474
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,097
Keep your kid out of my yard!

475
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:21,166
Goddamn freak.

476
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,038
Happy Halloween.

477
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,200
Screw you!

478
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,987
Get the hell off my!

479
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:47,750
Well, zip-a-dee-doo-dah.

480
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:02,695
Spite?

481
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:38,331
Spite?

482
01:06:42,899 --> 01:06:45,060
Who the hell are you?

483
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,370
Wilkins! Wilkins!

484
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:40,948
Over here! Wilkins!
Wilkins, help me, goddamn it!

485
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,677
Help me! Wilkins!

486
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:45,184
Help me!

487
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:25,544
<i>- 911, please hold.
- Hello? Hello?</i>

488
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:30,956
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

489
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:34,096
Yeah, I'd like to report...

490
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:39,098
Hello? Hello? Hello?

491
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:15,161
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

492
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:06,014
Oh, no.

493
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:01,763
Trick or treat.

494
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:08,626
Thank you.

495
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:13,002
Thank you.

496
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:20,471
Thanks, Mr. Kreeg.
Great mummy costume.

497
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:45,005
Thank you.

498
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,174
This was a great idea, honey.

499
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:24,270
It's just magical. It makes me wish
every night was Halloween.

500
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:30,407
I'm sorry, Em. Wait, wait. Not yet.

501
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,387
- What?
- You're supposed to keep it lit.

502
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:36,854
- Why?
- Ancient tradition?

503
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:41,655
Henry, it's Halloween, not Hanukkah.
Baby, I'm lit, and you're lit.

504
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:45,527
But your little friend here?
His night's over.

505
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:48,765
You know, you should be more careful.

506
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:51,303
There are rules. You might upset someone.

507
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:54,101
Oh, please. Who?

508
01:17:17,533 --> 01:17:21,060
Over here.

509
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,206
Trick or treat.
