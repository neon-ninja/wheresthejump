1
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:18,655
Oh, I'm so hungry.

2
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:26,679
If only there was some juicy,
delectable, tasty humans.

3
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:33,525
But wait. I see one, two.

4
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,774
But which one will I eat first?

5
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:38,475
Her.

6
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,826
Her.

7
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,178
Her? You think her?

8
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:45,749
Well, maybe I'm gonna eat
her anyway. Ahhh!

9
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:47,818
Oh, I've got you.

10
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,257
Oh, I'm gonna miss you girls.

11
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,692
I hate it when you're away.

12
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,710
When will you be back?

13
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,729
It's just a couple of days
this time, alright?

14
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:03,333
Enough scary stories. Bed time.

15
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,535
No.

16
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,804
Come on. Bed time

17
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,340
Okay. Why don't you guys go
and brush your teeth

18
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:13,110
and I'll come upstairs, and we'll
read that book that you love, okay?

19
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:16,413
Okay. Go. Go. Quickly. Race.

20
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,771
I could get used to this.

21
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,741
Yeah. This...

22
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,823
this conference is...

23
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:31,561
It's the most important thing
ever. I know. You already said that.

24
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,830
Yeah. It's a big one.
It's a game changer.

25
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,833
Yeah, same as the last one,
and the next one after that.

26
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:40,704
Because I don't wanna, I don't wanna
bring the girls up in my Mom's old house

27
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:43,640
and I want them to have
their own bedrooms.

28
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,246
They love sharing, you know? Almost as
much as they love their Dad coming home.

29
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:57,270
Yeah, well, this is it and then
I am all theirs, and I'm all ours.

30
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,713
If that's okay, huh?

31
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,459
Bye.

32
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,621
Jess, you seen the book the
girls love?

33
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,792
Babe. I'm gonna check
if it's in the car.

34
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,761
Jess, you seen the keys?

35
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,256
What the fuck?

36
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,863
What's wrong with Mommy?

37
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:54,804
Baby, you stay here with Mommy.
Don't move. Don't move.

38
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:11,777
Daddy!

39
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,022
Baby?

40
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:26,992
Baby?

41
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,044
Oh, baby. Baby, give me your
hand.

42
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:36,046
Baby, it's okay.

43
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,337
It's okay. Give me your hand.

44
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,817
Baby, come on. It's okay.

45
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,908
Baby.

46
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,572
Welcome to paradise.

47
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,107
See anything on your way in?

48
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,776
Aah!

49
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:04,768
It's no use.

50
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:05,792
Oh fuck!

51
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:11,975
Oh, God. Jess. The kids.

52
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:15,545
No. No. No. Fuck, no.

53
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,447
He doesn't want them.

54
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,104
Only you.

55
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,740
What's your name?

56
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,743
Jay.

57
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,190
Adam.

58
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,658
Kat.

59
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,965
What is this place?

60
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,056
As bad as it looks, man.

61
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,661
I gotta get the fuck outta here.

62
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,112
You behave, you stay here.

63
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:26,071
You don't, you go back.
Understand?

64
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:33,513
Eat.

65
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,192
I said eat, boy.

66
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,036
This is your home now.

67
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,224
It's for the market.

68
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,658
What do we do when we're upset?

69
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,771
Remember.

70
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,728
Remember what?

71
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,208
Who saved me.

72
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:08,211
Yeah. Good boy. Hmm?

73
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,680
I just want my Mom.

74
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:14,751
Your mother and father are scum.
They abandoned you.

75
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:20,045
If they cared about you, they'd have
come looking for you, now, wouldn't they?

76
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,448
I'm your father now.

77
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:28,086
And if you upset me,
I swear to fucking God...

78
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,701
Who's doing this?

79
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,705
He was there when I got here.

80
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,074
Kat calls him Paul.

81
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,810
After my cat.

82
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,467
Paul doesn't say much.

83
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,751
Where were you when
you were taken?

84
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,386
Parking lot after a night out.

85
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,922
Working the graveyard shift.

86
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,475
It's his playground.

87
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,856
Whose?

88
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,230
See, this must have been a
mistake

89
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,232
'cause I'm a good person.

90
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,768
I didn't do anything wrong.

91
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,138
You see, I do charity. I...

92
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,540
I gave blood once.

93
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,842
Oh, get used to that shit.

94
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,945
A big fan of the red stuff.

95
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,181
I take it you've tried
to talk to this prick?

96
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:30,019
Oh, yeah. I've tried to hug
it out, bought him flowers.

97
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:33,022
One guy did all this? I mean,
you're a fucking cop!

98
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,557
Security guard.

99
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,025
Well, you are.

100
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,028
Good to know.

101
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,399
Dominic!

102
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,879
Are you trying to test me?

103
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,986
Hey, don't start with me, son.

104
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,512
Dominic?

105
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,233
Father, I'm sorry!

106
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,033
Are ya?

107
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:51,901
Yes!

108
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:52,635
Say it again.

109
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,436
I'm sorry!

110
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,437
Ssh.

111
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,545
That's it. Let the evil out.

112
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,237
What was that?

113
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,672
Feeding time.

114
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,073
What's with the lights?

115
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,675
Well, it ain't fucking
Christmas.

116
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,611
What, so he warns you
before he tortures you?

117
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,113
Yep.

118
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:41,372
Only it's not him that
does the torturing.

119
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,452
Who does?

120
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,945
You're his pets.

121
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,314
It's not even cooked.

122
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,653
No thanks. I'm vegan.

123
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,590
Of course, by vegan
you mean fucked.

124
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:25,528
Well don't waste it.
Throw it back.

125
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,966
Quite the summer camp, ain't it?

126
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,101
It's a big mistake, not eating.

127
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,103
Not exactly Mother Theresa.

128
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,140
What about Paul?

129
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,142
He gets injections.

130
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,233
They keep him alive.

131
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,084
That's your future, right there.

132
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,154
You two can do what you want

133
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,346
but I'm getting outta
here if it kills me.

134
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,694
A very poor choice of words.

135
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,106
Come on!

136
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,507
Any loose?

137
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,742
Not yet.

138
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,478
Nothing your side?

139
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,035
Found this.

140
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,638
Not been very lucky for me.

141
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,176
What?

142
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,750
It's a waste of time.

143
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,431
Like your police application?

144
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,133
Like your mom's labor.

145
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,606
Not got any keys?

146
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,640
Nope.

147
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,542
Do you have any?

148
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,840
Shit!

149
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,425
A hundred years, and nails like

150
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:05,327
Freddy fucking Krueger
wouldn't get through it.

151
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,486
Or you could learn the hard way.

152
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,367
Adam's right.

153
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,291
The only way out is
through that door.

154
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,525
Hey.

155
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,462
Seriously. If he sees you doing
that, he'll go fucking insane.

156
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:42,331
I had an ex just like you.

157
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,100
He wouldn't give up either.

158
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:48,637
I had to get his Dad arrested for
raping me, just to get rid of him.

159
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,605
So he deserved it.

160
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,363
Oh, he didn't touch me.

161
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,436
When I was 15, I'd set up
dates with married guys.

162
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:00,471
Take pictures

163
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,207
send them to their wives.

164
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,246
Fucking perverts.

165
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,760
I'd give a nut right now
to be back at home.

166
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,863
Guess which one's
gonna happen first?

167
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:16,754
Gives the old ball and chain
a whole new meaning, huh?

168
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:21,726
You guys are fucking
insane, you know that?

169
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,365
Don't.

170
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:35,584
If Frankenstein comes back
in, we'll all lose our fuckin' balls.

171
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,750
Dominic

172
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:06,330
Playing it safe, huh?

173
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:23,948
Why did you do that?

174
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,295
I don't know.

175
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,585
You don't know.

176
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:31,522
But you chose to do it.

177
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,971
You see, every maneuver is a
promise.

178
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:40,442
A promise to your next maneuver
and your next one.

179
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:45,002
'Cause life's all about choices.
When you got no choice

180
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,471
you got nothing.

181
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,911
You chose to be here
with me, didn't you?

182
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:57,648
Dominic.

183
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,891
Dominic.

184
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:10,594
I'm asking you a question.

185
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,890
Ugh!

186
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:06,095
Your mother and father are scum.
They abandoned you.

187
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,020
If they cared about you, they'd have
come looking for you now, wouldn't they?

188
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:14,759
I'm your father now.

189
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:27,798
I need to tell you a secret.

190
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,518
This is the world that
left you for dead.

191
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,825
But ours isn't a strange
world, is it, son?

192
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:52,022
I'll never let anyone
hurt you again.

193
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,666
Promise you'll never leave me.

194
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,847
Yes, father.

195
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:07,483
And you'll grow big and strong?

196
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:08,906
I promise.

197
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,242
Show me.

198
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:19,016
Grow big and strong,
just like him.

199
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,855
It's beautiful.

200
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,836
We're just like each other

201
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,927
one and the same.

202
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,585
Not all of us are kind.

203
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:20,222
Some of us need to have
the evil taken out of us.

204
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,313
Does that mean you're evil too?

205
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:26,044
Yeah.

206
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:29,468
See, sometimes, we do bad things and the
only way to take the bad out is through pain.

207
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:33,791
I want you to stab it.

208
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,226
Remove the evil.

209
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,943
It's what's gonna make you a
man, Dominic.

210
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,744
Healing through pain.

211
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:49,051
I promise. I'm not
gonna punish you.

212
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,226
Oh, that's it.

213
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,228
That's it.

214
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:04,989
Oh, good boy. Huh? That
wasn't so bad, was it?

215
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,292
Huh?

216
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,327
Watch the evil, huh?

217
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,796
Watch it leave me.

218
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:27,689
Oh, you...

219
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:30,381
You motherfucker.

220
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,028
What? What is it?

221
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:36,231
Oh, come on, then,
you fucking pussy.

222
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:38,033
You enjoy watching...

223
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,670
Have you never noticed this?

224
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:44,339
Shut the fuck up for our sakes.

225
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,041
What are you hiding from?

226
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:49,911
I'm married, you prick.
I have a fucking life.

227
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,292
Jay, please, Adam's right.

228
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,464
Great.

229
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:45,434
Great, thank you.
Thank you so much!

230
00:28:58,204 --> 00:28:59,347
Come on.

231
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,057
My wife, my daughters.

232
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:43,759
Hey!

233
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,315
My wife and my daughters.

234
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:47,851
Are they alright?

235
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,024
Does that mean they're okay?

236
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,165
Don't.

237
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25,100
You gotta let him, man.

238
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:27,369
Or he'll go for our families.

239
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:41,583
Oh.

240
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:13,582
Jay, you have to do what he
says.

241
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:20,488
It'll be worse if you don't.

242
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:33,401
Don't do anything stupid.
It's either Paul or you.

243
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:52,454
No, no. No, no.

244
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:08,436
No, no. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please.

245
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:39,167
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

246
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:49,678
It's... what the fuck?

247
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:57,552
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh my god, no.

248
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,538
She's fucking choking, man.

249
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,342
She's fucking choking!

250
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,100
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

251
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:41,078
I do like a birthday.

252
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,783
You can talk to me, you know.

253
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,726
What are you looking at?

254
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:58,728
Nothing.

255
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:00,797
Bring it here.

256
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:13,677
Who did that?

257
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,549
Doesn't matter.

258
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,197
Why?

259
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,554
I said it doesn't matter.

260
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:26,367
Sit down.

261
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,536
How come it doesn't matter?

262
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,599
Come here.

263
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:41,282
It's alright.

264
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:05,862
Whatever you're doing, don't.

265
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,780
Fuck you, man. How many
times I gotta tell you?

266
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:17,185
Paul tried that. You
wanna be like him?

267
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:19,276
Oh, fuck.

268
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:54,938
Grass greener on the other side
of the door, asshole?

269
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,440
Is there a way out?

270
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:02,879
Oh, so we didn't suffer for
nothing. Great.

271
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:07,328
We can escape.

272
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:10,965
We just need to be clever.

273
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,059
What's he doing?

274
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:18,906
He's just pissed you're back.

275
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,609
Why is everything a
fucking joke to you?

276
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,700
The joke's on us, my friend!

277
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,894
What's he doing?

278
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:41,396
Why doesn't he just kill us?

279
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,065
No one throw away
their favorite toys.

280
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,959
I have to.

281
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,597
Adam, please don't!

282
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:04,512
It's either you or me.

283
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:06,073
I can't fucking take
this anymore.

284
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:31,955
Never leave me.

285
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:51,786
I can't feel my arms!

286
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:32,549
God!

287
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,888
Come on! Get up!

288
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,223
Huh?

289
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,324
Come on!

290
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:09,252
You promised you were
gonna spent more time with us...

291
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:10,898
Jay!

292
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,482
Hey.

293
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,068
Jay! You've gotta
stay with us.

294
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,116
You guys ever seen his face?

295
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,885
Oh yeah, he's gorgeous.

296
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,787
No. We haven't.

297
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:37,925
So what's the freak hiding?

298
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,795
I don't know. Probably
just ugly. Never kissed a girl.

299
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:42,746
No, specifics.

300
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,699
Come on, you guys have clapped
eyes on him more than me.

301
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:45,833
He stinks.

302
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:48,135
Yeah. We all stink.

303
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:48,836
More.

304
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:51,105
He doesn't speak.

305
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,206
Right. More.

306
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,297
Paul, shut the fuck up.

307
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,851
What was that?

308
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:04,952
Just leave him be.

309
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,754
Schh!

310
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:08,756
He's trying to speak.

311
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:17,954
Paul, what?

312
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:31,312
Horse, what?

313
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:36,439
What are you trying to say?

314
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:49,318
Paul?

315
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:56,225
Horseshoe.

316
00:44:57,696 --> 00:44:59,173
He has a

317
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,276
a horseshoe burn on his hand.

318
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,680
I saw it when you
tore his glove off.

319
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:07,737
Oh my god.

320
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:10,885
Paul was trying to tell us.

321
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:15,078
There's spiders. Worms next?

322
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:19,182
I know you.

323
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:24,732
I fucking know you.

324
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:30,326
After the farmer's wife died

325
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:32,962
he went crazy.

326
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,877
Started wearing a pig skin mask.

327
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:39,447
Locked his kid in the old
farmhouse.

328
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:42,016
Didn't let him out of his sight.

329
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,841
Made him eat the pigs alive

330
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,189
and then one night,

331
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:50,191
when the sky was at its blackest

332
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:55,062
the old man sharpened his axe
until it was ripe for scalping.

333
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,831
The kid was hiding.

334
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:59,500
All he could hear were his
footsteps.

335
00:45:59,524 --> 00:46:03,104
Louder and louder, closer and
closer.

336
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:06,841
Police found what was left of
the kid

337
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:08,931
in the scalding chamber.

338
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:11,212
Skinless.

339
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:16,217
And they say the farmer
still stalks these woods

340
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:19,475
looking for his next victim...

341
00:46:23,481 --> 00:46:25,226
It's not true.

342
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,295
Is so. Creepy farmer.

343
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,764
Stuff of legend.

344
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:32,233
I'd kill that crazy freak.

345
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:36,036
I don't think I could.

346
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,093
Think about it.

347
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:40,563
Actually ending a dude's life.

348
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,812
Let's go find the farmhouse.

349
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,808
What's that?

350
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,601
Kat, Kat, come on. Kat.

351
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:29,456
Dominic, the boy.

352
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,258
What the fuck are
you talking about?

353
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:32,827
The traveller, Kat.

354
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:36,564
The one with the horseshoe
burned on the back of his hand.

355
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:39,322
It was my family summer
vacation.

356
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:41,602
Holy shit.

357
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:50,311
Hey. He's still following us.

358
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,274
Hey, what's that scar?

359
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:03,390
Whoa.

360
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:04,525
Looks like a wiener.

361
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:08,284
Wiener fingers doesn't
say much, does he?

362
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:11,921
Say Adam's a fucking asshole.

363
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:16,503
Adam's a fucking asshole.

364
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:20,875
So. Horseshoe.

365
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,877
You wanna hang with us?

366
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:28,449
You could replace.

367
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:35,444
What's your name?

368
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:39,159
Dominic.

369
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:41,128
Well, you can be in our gang.

370
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,654
Just needs to pass the dare.

371
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:19,523
Stop.

372
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:32,234
Oh shit! Did you swallow that?

373
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:34,571
Ugh.

374
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:37,044
You do wanna be in
our gang, right?

375
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,618
Don't let them get in your eye.

376
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:19,620
They'll eat your brain.

377
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:26,093
Actually, let's leave him.

378
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,264
Leave him?

379
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:42,342
Oh, fuck.

380
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:44,378
We left him in that
creepy farmhouse.

381
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:49,249
He's done all this 'cause he was in
some house for a moment? Come on.

382
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:51,118
It was more than a moment.

383
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:54,855
I don't wanna him back here,
okay, he can stay out for ever!

384
00:51:56,497 --> 00:51:58,092
Get, boy. You get
before I beat you!

385
00:51:58,116 --> 00:52:04,264
Stop it! No, don't say
that! Stop it! No!

386
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:05,632
What you say to me?

387
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:19,535
Someone's in trouble.

388
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:31,492
I did it after they
shot my horse.

389
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:36,619
He was my best friend.

390
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:40,801
I've got something really
cool to show you.

391
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,591
Don't worry, it's just us.

392
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:20,574
I'm sorry but...

393
00:53:20,598 --> 00:53:22,442
this really is the final dare.

394
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:26,835
Look, all you have to
do is just go inside.

395
00:53:27,605 --> 00:53:28,949
I'll kiss if you do it.

396
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:32,274
Show us how brave you
travel kids really are.

397
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:36,757
You wanna kiss me, right?
Then go inside.

398
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:37,724
20 minutes.

399
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,726
Make it 20 years.

400
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:01,982
No wait!

401
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:05,285
Shit!

402
00:54:16,787 --> 00:54:18,854
I went home that afternoon.

403
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,758
I never thought I'd
see you guys again.

404
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:26,673
Did anyone see
him after? The kid?

405
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:28,809
My mom. She said ..

406
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:30,844
Don't go into that farmhouse.

407
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:32,579
She'd known I was there.

408
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,448
What month were we at the camp?

409
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:36,583
My thirteenth birthday.

410
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:37,851
August 25th.

411
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:39,975
I had that big meeting tomorrow.

412
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:42,278
It was the 24th.

413
00:54:43,014 --> 00:54:44,558
That's 20 years.

414
00:54:44,582 --> 00:54:46,749
We were kids, we didn't
know any better.

415
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:49,263
Neither does he.

416
00:55:40,071 --> 00:55:41,570
Why aren't you working?

417
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:44,318
I heard a noise.

418
00:55:44,342 --> 00:55:46,320
Bullshit.

419
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:53,916
No!

420
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:00,022
Ahh!

421
00:56:03,894 --> 00:56:04,871
Oh sorry.

422
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:10,510
Get back to work.

423
00:58:30,608 --> 00:58:32,686
How dare you?

424
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:34,811
Okay.

425
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:39,047
Ahh!

426
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:56,009
Ahh! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

427
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,065
Ah!

428
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,783
No, don't! You, you had a son.

429
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:07,587
Henry. Are you gonna kill me

430
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:09,211
just like you killed him?

431
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:13,459
I didn't kill him.

432
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:16,162
It was an accident in the scalding
chamber, he wasn't strong enough.

433
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:18,954
You took me to replace him.

434
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:21,467
Didn't you?

435
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:23,158
I just wanted you to
be stronger, huh?

436
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:25,138
I hate you.

437
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:29,197
You wouldn't last five minutes
out there without me.

438
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,113
No one loves you like I do.

439
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:38,740
How do you love me?

440
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,022
That scum outside?

441
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:45,859
They're burning marks in
your skin. Leaving you to rot.

442
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:48,350
Well, surely they're a
better scum than you.

443
01:00:30,728 --> 01:00:32,138
I'm sorry.

444
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:34,708
I didn't mean
what I said before.

445
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:37,399
No wonder no one
came looking for you.

446
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:47,654
What are you doing?
Wait! Wait! No, stop! Stop!

447
01:00:47,678 --> 01:00:49,689
How can I let you live?

448
01:00:49,713 --> 01:00:51,658
A fraud in Henry's home.

449
01:00:51,682 --> 01:00:53,627
Please, please don't,
please don't!

450
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:54,928
Ahh! Ahh!

451
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:56,930
Oh god, oh, stop!

452
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:59,966
Tried to remove the evil ..

453
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,267
To make you strong!

454
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:03,737
No! Oh god, please!
Please, please no!

455
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:05,839
Father, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

456
01:01:05,863 --> 01:01:07,841
But it doesn't leave everyone.

457
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:13,079
Sorry, please! Let me go!

458
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:14,681
No, no, no!

459
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:18,685
Agh! Please no, stop!
Ah! Oh god! Ah!

460
01:01:58,382 --> 01:01:59,448
Henry.

461
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:01,394
It's Dominic.

462
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:05,331
My parents were looking for me.

463
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:07,734
You burned them alive.

464
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:13,740
I love you, son.

465
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:16,476
You already killed your son.

466
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:24,784
Ah! Oh, oh!

467
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:05,225
I need to tell ya a secret.

468
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:10,396
The only way you'll ever truly
be free is if you find them.

469
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:13,233
Those that abandoned you.

470
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:18,371
When you're big and strong,
no matter how long it takes

471
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:24,077
no matter how hard you look,
bring them back here

472
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:26,946
and let the evil out.

473
01:03:54,598 --> 01:03:56,176
We need to apologize.

474
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,844
For what?

475
01:03:57,868 --> 01:04:00,013
We only knew each other
two fucking days.

476
01:04:00,037 --> 01:04:01,047
At most.

477
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:03,499
Think about it.

478
01:04:03,523 --> 01:04:06,319
When kids get bullied, who do they
want to like 'em more than anyone else?

479
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:09,489
What a nicer place to make
friends.

480
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,057
Ah, think about it.

481
01:04:11,081 --> 01:04:13,293
If we can tap into even just a

482
01:04:13,317 --> 01:04:17,363
chink of humanity in that fucked
up head of his.

483
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:19,065
And do what? Just let us go?

484
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:20,300
Better the devil you know.

485
01:04:20,324 --> 01:04:21,034
Exactly.

486
01:04:21,058 --> 01:04:22,368
Jesus Christ.

487
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,370
Fuck you, I'm getting outta
here.

488
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:30,532
Alright. Huh. Dominic.

489
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:12,140
No.

490
01:05:13,176 --> 01:05:14,654
Dominic.

491
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:16,578
Now we know who you are.

492
01:05:17,314 --> 01:05:19,481
And we know what we did.

493
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:24,530
It was wrong to leave you.

494
01:05:24,554 --> 01:05:29,903
Now, I can't claim to know or...

495
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:31,271
or where to understand

496
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:32,938
I can't.

497
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:34,628
What you've been going
through in the past

498
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:37,032
the past 20 years.

499
01:05:38,669 --> 01:05:40,235
What I do know

500
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:43,038
is that each one of us

501
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:44,484
is sorry.

502
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:48,588
We're so sorry.

503
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:54,394
We wanna get out of here, we do,
man. We wanna get out of here with you.

504
01:06:04,962 --> 01:06:06,272
No, no.

505
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,106
No!

506
01:06:18,675 --> 01:06:21,187
Oh come on, man.

507
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:22,388
Spiders.

508
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:23,990
Come on, poor souls, ah.

509
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:27,593
Please no more. No more. No.

510
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,397
I'm sorry!

511
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:35,401
Okay. Okay.

512
01:06:36,727 --> 01:06:37,971
Okay.

513
01:06:50,774 --> 01:06:53,186
In her ear.

514
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:04,230
No!

515
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:21,400
No!

516
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:15,521
Yah! Grab the hose!

517
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:16,756
Adam, come on!

518
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,479
Ugh! Ugh!

519
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:35,396
No, no, no, no!
No! No! Oh!

520
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:39,779
Ugh! No! No!

521
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:44,606
Oh please! Oh.

522
01:10:45,675 --> 01:10:46,686
His eye.

523
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:47,987
Oh god, no!

524
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:48,854
Cut it.

525
01:10:56,886 --> 01:10:59,665
No, no!

526
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:45,833
Hey asshole!

527
01:11:46,703 --> 01:11:47,446
That's right.

528
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:55,655
No wonder we left you to rot.

529
01:11:57,447 --> 01:12:00,660
Look at you. A girl wouldn't
kiss you to save her life.

530
01:12:00,684 --> 01:12:04,363
You're nothing but
a waste of skin.

531
01:12:04,387 --> 01:12:08,534
Leaving you was the best thing we
ever fucking did, you fucking freak!

532
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:09,757
I'll kiss you then.

533
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,477
No one will ever love you.

534
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,746
All you have to do
is just go inside.

535
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:24,550
Your mother and father are scum.
They abandoned you...

536
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:26,319
I'm your father now.

537
01:12:26,343 --> 01:12:27,320
No one...

538
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:39,620
Get it out!

539
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:41,534
Cut me loose.

540
01:12:48,398 --> 01:12:50,376
Has it gone inside?

541
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,712
Oh shit, you gotta pull it out!

542
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:53,412
What?

543
01:12:55,071 --> 01:12:57,717
Pull it out! Don't let me die.

544
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:01,854
I'm not gonna let you die, I'm not
gonna let you die. Wait, bite down.

545
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,556
Right down. Hold him down.

546
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,646
Ahh!

547
01:14:25,929 --> 01:14:28,007
Alright this it okay, he's
gonna come for us.

548
01:14:28,031 --> 01:14:29,208
We've got nothing to lose.

549
01:14:29,232 --> 01:14:31,098
Just one other fucking eye.

550
01:14:31,835 --> 01:14:34,513
Oh, he's gonna kill me.

551
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:38,940
Oh god, it's fine, you're
gonna fucking kill me.

552
01:14:41,177 --> 01:14:44,812
It's best you hand over the
knife. I need it more than you.

553
01:14:46,015 --> 01:14:48,227
I gotta protect myself!

554
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:49,728
You're braver than me.

555
01:14:49,752 --> 01:14:51,130
No one's gonna get hurt anymore.

556
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:53,799
That's easy for you to say,
you got the fucking knife!

557
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,983
Give it!

558
01:14:55,007 --> 01:14:56,168
No, Adam. Adam, come on.

559
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:05,010
Don't. Don't.

560
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:08,914
Stop it! Stop it!

561
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:12,740
Stop!

562
01:15:23,286 --> 01:15:23,929
Adam.

563
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:54,560
Kat, it's not your fault.

564
01:15:54,584 --> 01:15:57,118
Kat, repeat after me,
"It wasn't my fault."

565
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,290
Maybe it was my fault.

566
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:04,158
All of it.

567
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:06,961
I never went back.

568
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:10,543
I never checked to
see if he was okay.

569
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:14,847
After you left, the police came.

570
01:16:14,871 --> 01:16:18,884
Asking all kinds of shit
about a missing boy.

571
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:21,554
And you know what I told them?

572
01:16:21,578 --> 01:16:24,189
Fucking zero.

573
01:16:24,213 --> 01:16:26,792
All this time you knew?

574
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:28,594
20 years.

575
01:16:28,618 --> 01:16:32,219
20 fucking years I held onto
this shit and for what?

576
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:35,356
You left him too.

577
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:38,971
You could have saved him.

578
01:16:38,995 --> 01:16:42,196
You could have told someone.

579
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,678
You could have stopped this.

580
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:50,204
Let her go.

581
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:53,352
We just wanna go home.

582
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:56,043
I returned to your world after.

583
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:02,194
Still no family.

584
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:04,029
You're a good kid, Dominic.

585
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:07,288
No. I was still unwanted.

586
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,290
An orphan.

587
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:14,139
Came back here.
The farmer was right.

588
01:17:14,163 --> 01:17:15,874
You are all scum!

589
01:17:15,898 --> 01:17:17,109
You were my friend.

590
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,133
No.

591
01:17:18,935 --> 01:17:20,212
You abandoned me.

592
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:22,715
Left me for dead.

593
01:17:26,776 --> 01:17:28,754
Why don't you let
me see that face?

594
01:17:36,686 --> 01:17:37,997
I'm not gonna hurt you.

595
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:40,733
Let me see, my friend.

596
01:17:58,374 --> 01:18:00,307
See that wasn't so hard.

597
01:18:02,412 --> 01:18:06,447
I would have come and rescued you if
I'd known what you were going through.

598
01:18:31,908 --> 01:18:32,451
Ahh!

599
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:21,155
I failed.

600
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:26,227
The evil never left you.

601
01:19:38,908 --> 01:19:40,341
Kill me.

602
01:19:55,992 --> 01:19:59,505
Look at you. You're pathetic.

603
01:20:08,371 --> 01:20:09,248
Come on!

604
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:04,203
Yaah! Ah, oh.

605
01:21:12,101 --> 01:21:13,278
Urgh!

606
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:14,146
Dah!

607
01:23:05,348 --> 01:23:07,259
Ahh-ah!

608
01:23:07,283 --> 01:23:08,283
Ugh.

609
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:09,750
Uugh!

610
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,031
Ah, god!

611
01:23:13,055 --> 01:23:14,055
Arrh!

612
01:23:17,727 --> 01:23:19,393
Ur-ah! Ya!

613
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,506
Raah!

614
01:23:34,076 --> 01:23:35,776
Ru-aah!

615
01:23:48,557 --> 01:23:55,662
Uahh! Uah! Uah! Uah! Ugh!

616
01:25:04,366 --> 01:25:06,578
I could have had a family.

617
01:25:16,212 --> 01:25:19,379
If I could fix it,
I would, I swear.

618
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:29,123
Well then, fix it now.

619
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,766
Now end it.

620
01:25:40,503 --> 01:25:41,813
Kill me.

621
01:25:48,177 --> 01:25:50,177
Kill me.

622
01:25:53,382 --> 01:25:55,193
No.

623
01:25:55,217 --> 01:25:56,661
No, I can't.

624
01:26:00,723 --> 01:26:02,701
Aah!

625
01:26:04,727 --> 01:26:06,771
Your wife. I'll take her.

626
01:26:06,795 --> 01:26:09,429
She'll suffer worse than you.

627
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,565
Look at me.

628
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:14,168
Ahh!

629
01:26:15,638 --> 01:26:17,838
Your daughters will live with
me.

630
01:26:19,742 --> 01:26:21,720
I will make them love me.

631
01:26:32,254 --> 01:26:33,231
Huah!

632
01:26:36,392 --> 01:26:38,503
Gah!

633
01:28:07,683 --> 01:28:09,283
Jay!

634
01:28:12,755 --> 01:28:13,765
Jay!

635
01:28:18,861 --> 01:28:20,572
Oh my god!

636
01:28:20,596 --> 01:28:21,973
I'll live.

637
01:28:25,034 --> 01:28:26,811
Daddy?

638
01:28:28,604 --> 01:28:30,582
Molly. Poppy.

639
01:28:37,046 --> 01:28:38,857
What's wrong with your face?

640
01:28:40,382 --> 01:28:42,883
Daddy's gonna be okay.
Alright?

641
01:29:33,502 --> 01:29:35,736
Dad would kill us if
he knew we were here.

642
01:29:36,672 --> 01:29:37,515
Dude...

643
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,919
Dad will never know.
Besides, the freak's long gone.

644
01:29:40,943 --> 01:29:43,543
D-E-A-D. Fucked.

645
01:29:44,413 --> 01:29:46,157
I hate dares.

646
01:29:46,181 --> 01:29:47,926
Well then, you should
have chosen truth instead.

647
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:52,119
And you and Isaac could have stayed
at home like little virgin snowflakes.

648
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:57,702
Is it really the same forest?

649
01:29:57,726 --> 01:30:00,138
Yeah. Not far from here.

650
01:30:00,162 --> 01:30:01,773
Your dad kicked his ass, right?

651
01:30:01,797 --> 01:30:05,432
Hells, yeah. Ten years ago
tonight.

652
01:30:06,001 --> 01:30:07,645
No, I get it.

653
01:30:10,406 --> 01:30:12,450
Freak fed him cockroaches.

654
01:30:12,474 --> 01:30:15,387
Made them slice each other.

655
01:30:15,411 --> 01:30:17,088
Nailed them to the wall.

656
01:30:17,112 --> 01:30:20,547
He even kept their skin.

657
01:30:21,683 --> 01:30:23,461
But that's not all.

658
01:30:23,485 --> 01:30:26,798
Dude, pinned one of the
prisoners down and...

659
01:30:26,822 --> 01:30:28,733
Got him with the worms!

660
01:30:29,191 --> 01:30:31,669
Poppy! Oh.

661
01:30:35,831 --> 01:30:36,841
So.

662
01:30:36,865 --> 01:30:40,145
Who's coming with me to find the
farmhouse?

663
01:30:40,169 --> 01:30:40,979
Yeah, I'm game.

664
01:30:41,003 --> 01:30:41,846
Yeah?

665
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:43,515
No, no way.

666
01:30:43,539 --> 01:30:45,517
You know they never found a
body.

667
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:46,541
What?

668
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:48,042
Oh shit.

669
01:30:49,711 --> 01:30:50,889
Yo.

670
01:30:50,913 --> 01:30:53,725
I'm gonna go grab my
gloves from the car.

671
01:30:53,749 --> 01:30:55,460
It's freezing out here, man.

672
01:31:06,061 --> 01:31:08,228
Yo. Fuck this, come on guys.

673
01:31:10,699 --> 01:31:13,211
Come on, I'll, I'll bring
the car around.

674
01:31:19,074 --> 01:31:21,453
We should go.

675
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:26,146
Pussies.

676
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:29,082
Poppy, come on!
