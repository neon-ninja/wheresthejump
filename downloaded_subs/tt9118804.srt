2
00:02:14,697 --> 00:02:16,431
I couldn't.

3
00:02:17,332 --> 00:02:18,834
You have to, Jerry.

4
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:21,235
The best revenge is revenge.

5
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:26,274
I mean come on, she cheated
on you first, right?

6
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:28,209
So I have to cheat on her?

7
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:29,712
You know what she's
gonna think if you don't?

8
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:30,879
No, why?

9
00:02:30,913 --> 00:02:33,214
She's gonna mistake kindness
for weakness, all right?

10
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:35,484
You'll be sending
the wrong message.

11
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:38,754
That it's all right to fuck
around without consequences.

12
00:02:38,787 --> 00:02:40,154
This will even the score.

13
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:44,493
A healthy relationship
is an equal relationship.

14
00:02:48,597 --> 00:02:52,768
I don't know, who am I
gonna cheat with, Mort?

15
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:54,570
Don't look at me, guys.

16
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:55,504
You're on the list.

17
00:02:56,572 --> 00:03:00,141
Jerry, you're a good guy
and you're a great husband.

18
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,479
- You think so?
- I know so

19
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:07,716
and that is why I have
the perfect thing for you.

20
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:13,187
Tonight, I'm getting you
the Special, my friend.

21
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:15,891
- No, Mike, no, no.
- Oh yes, man.

22
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:17,559
You're getting the Special.

23
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:18,861
I'm not going to some
massage parlor whorehouse

24
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:21,497
for a $5 happy ending I
could do myself for free.

25
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,531
Gross, please.

26
00:03:24,232 --> 00:03:25,166
Trust me.

27
00:03:26,367 --> 00:03:28,570
It is not what you think.

28
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:31,707
Before we go, I'm gonna need you

29
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,776
to put this bag over your head.

30
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:37,412
- Are you kidding me?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

31
00:03:37,445 --> 00:03:39,948
Put that on your head
or you can forget it.

32
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:41,517
Why?

33
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,384
Because I know you
well enough and after

34
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:45,420
you have what you're
about to have,

35
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:47,422
you're gonna go back
there every single night

36
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:50,526
until you're broke and
even that won't be enough.

37
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:52,561
So consider this a
preventative measure.

38
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:54,930
Really?

39
00:03:54,963 --> 00:03:57,599
Yeah, really, just
put the bag on, come on.

40
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:00,301
Okay, okay, fine.

41
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,337
Yeah.

42
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:06,542
Dick.

43
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:08,209
You're
gonna love it, man.

44
00:04:09,745 --> 00:04:10,679
You look good.

45
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:13,015
Am I gonna
suffocate in here?

46
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:14,550
- Can you breathe now?
- Yeah.

47
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,453
Then you're
fine, can you see?

48
00:04:17,486 --> 00:04:18,854
- No.
- Are you sure?

49
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,321
Mike, I can't see.

50
00:04:20,354 --> 00:04:21,890
How many fingers
am I holding up?

51
00:04:21,924 --> 00:04:23,959
I don't know, four?

52
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:25,293
That's a good guess.

53
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:48,517
All right my friend,
we have arrived.

54
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:52,286
Can I take this off?

55
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,856
Yeah, take it off.

56
00:04:58,794 --> 00:04:59,595
Where?

57
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:06,502
Not a massage parlor, a
psychic front for a whorehouse.

58
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:08,804
- Nice.
- Not just any psychic,

59
00:05:08,837 --> 00:05:10,706
Madam Zhora's.

60
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:12,708
Your future is
about to get rocked.

61
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:15,911
- Oh god Mike, all right.
- Come on.

62
00:05:15,944 --> 00:05:17,479
Let's get this over with.

63
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:19,615
Let's do it, come on.

64
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:23,317
Come on, you are gonna be
thanking me so much, Jerry.

65
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:26,522
- Who's house is this?
- Stop asking questions.

66
00:05:27,923 --> 00:05:29,458
Ladies.

67
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:52,446
Are you the Special?

68
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:58,620
Her name is Syn and believe
me, she lives up to the hype.

69
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:00,589
Wow.

70
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:02,825
Syn, you are

71
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:04,693
gold-

72
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:06,461
en.

73
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:10,398
Like me?

74
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:20,475
I like you, Jerry.

75
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:25,614
How did you know my...

76
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:28,483
You have it in your eyes.

77
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:35,423
- You will want the Special.
- That's what we're here for.

78
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:41,930
- She's not the Special?
- Her, no.

79
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:46,635
- Which one is it then?
- Oh, none of these.

80
00:06:46,668 --> 00:06:50,606
I mean they all seem pretty
damn special to me, man.

81
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,373
What do you want?

82
00:06:54,877 --> 00:06:58,580
Madame Zhora, we're
here for the special.

83
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:01,183
Both of you?

84
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:02,851
Oh no, just my buddy here.

85
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,419
His eyes.

86
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:07,656
Hey,

87
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:09,992
I'm Jerry.

88
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:14,428
Best sex of your life.

89
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:18,901
Dracula is the Special?

90
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:19,768
What?

91
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:23,639
Oh hell no, no.

92
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:25,540
You don't find me attractive?

93
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:28,810
Or

94
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:31,947
maybe you like Syn or

95
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:34,483
my other dolls better, eh?

96
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:37,953
Trust me Jerry,
after five minutes,

97
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:40,555
you're gonna be
forgetting all about Lisa.

98
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:45,060
- $60 now.
- Since when?

99
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:46,595
Since the last time.

100
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,675
Wait, there's nobody in here.

101
00:08:13,255 --> 00:08:14,623
What the fuck?

102
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:35,577
What?

103
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:48,623
No way.

104
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:08,643
Mike, this is some kind of joke.

105
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:30,699
Ugh, that's creepy.

106
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,934
Oh, gross.

107
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:36,872
Where am I?

108
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:44,613
You know what they
say, when in Rome, right?

109
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:47,549
All right.

110
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:51,053
Oh, I like this room.

111
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,756
So Syn, what are you...

112
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,692
It's a shame
you don't have it.

113
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:00,962
Oh, I got it and believe
me, I'm gonna bring it.

114
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:03,632
A few times, apparently.

115
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:23,919
Wow.

116
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:54,683
Dick in a box.

117
00:11:07,996 --> 00:11:12,167
I don't know where to
put my hands, okay.

118
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:18,640
Just the tip.

119
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,868
Jerry has found the Special.

120
00:12:01,816 --> 00:12:05,320
Get your friend, I
am missing my shows.

121
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:06,922
Okay, relax, "Matlock" is on

122
00:12:06,955 --> 00:12:09,691
like five times a day, lady.

123
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:14,829
Ah, jeez.

124
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:18,233
Jerry.

125
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:20,001
He breathes?

126
00:12:20,035 --> 00:12:21,470
He bleeds?

127
00:12:21,504 --> 00:12:23,338
Breathes, breathes,
he's breathing.

128
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:25,073
I think so, I'm not a doctor.

129
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,709
Like she's not a psychic, right?

130
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:30,145
- Oh, Jesus.
- Ivan.

131
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:35,217
- Hey Mike?
- Yeah Jerry, Jerry?

132
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,251
- Mike.
- Hey man.

133
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:40,288
- Jerry.
- Where is your car?

134
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:42,257
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
get off him, man.

135
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,825
He's still got a half
chop hanging out.

136
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:45,494
I can't take him
outside like this.

137
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:46,962
- So dress him.
- Me?

138
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:48,964
Isn't it what you
guys get paid for?

139
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:51,132
All right, jimmies

140
00:12:55,804 --> 00:12:58,273
and there's a lot of
sticky DNA on here.

141
00:13:01,276 --> 00:13:02,744
There you go, there you go.

142
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:06,214
- The car?
- It's out front.

143
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:08,984
It's gonna be all right, Jerry.

144
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:11,119
- Take the feet.
- Oh, god.

145
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:14,122
Okay.

146
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:17,158
Hey, hey, hey, let me get
his jacket, it's wintertime.

147
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:20,895
This is fun, all right.

148
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:24,266
Don't bring this one back,
tell him to not return.

149
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,969
He is what it wants.

150
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:30,171
Okay, understood.

151
00:13:39,582 --> 00:13:42,817
- What the fuck?
- Didn't I tell you?

152
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:46,421
Hey, just to be
transparent, I did have

153
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:49,024
to hold onto your penis while
we lifted you into the car.

154
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:52,427
You had one of those
four hour Viagra boners.

155
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:53,928
Yeah, I still do, dude.

156
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,397
Oh man, no.

157
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:58,534
God, what the
hell what in that box?

158
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:01,970
It is best not
to ask, trust me.

159
00:14:02,003 --> 00:14:04,540
Yeah, I guess, I mean
who the hell cares, right?

160
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:06,374
Exactly.

161
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:10,879
Please Mike, please.

162
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:17,453
See what I tell you, the
answer's no, all right?

163
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:19,387
- One and done.
- Come on.

164
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:21,189
- I'm your best friend.
- Yeah, I'm your best friend.

165
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:22,924
I'm doing you a favor
here, all right?

166
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:25,360
Just forget about
it, shake it off.

167
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:28,531
Just go in there and you
tell Lisa about how you

168
00:14:28,564 --> 00:14:32,867
just had the best sex of
your fucking life with a box.

169
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:37,172
Hey, you be a good boy

170
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:39,608
and I'll set you up with
Syn next time, all right?

171
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:41,343
She's pretty far out, trust me.

172
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:44,547
Just once a week, fuck
the bar, I need this, man.

173
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,382
Hey, hey, hey, baby steps.

174
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:48,950
Baby steps, we'll see.

175
00:14:58,627 --> 00:15:00,463
Where have you been?

176
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:01,996
Where does it look like, Lis?

177
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,234
Out drinking with Mike again?

178
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:08,937
I was
drinking with Jerry.

179
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:11,272
- Hey.
- What?

180
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,976
How'd you find
out about, you know?

181
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:18,380
Oh you know, drunk friend
of a friend type thing.

182
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:20,982
He must be a pretty good
customer because then one day,

183
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:25,019
that old lady, she
offered me the Special.

184
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:27,122
Shit.

185
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:31,226
I did it once, once is enough.

186
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:33,928
Why, is there some kind
of rule or something?

187
00:15:33,962 --> 00:15:36,231
Talk to Syn, she knows.

188
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:39,134
Once is enough.

189
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:43,506
Thanks, man.

190
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:46,341
That's what I do.

191
00:15:46,374 --> 00:15:47,442
For the support.

192
00:15:47,476 --> 00:15:49,944
Yeah, don't mention it, man.

193
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,515
- Are we square?
- Yeah.

194
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:53,948
- I got this.
- You got it.

195
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:00,021
Hey, don't forget
the Rhyerson files.

196
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:01,122
Yeah, yeah.

197
00:16:05,093 --> 00:16:07,028
No, I'm cool, thanks.

198
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:12,333
I think I'm just
gonna go to sleep.

199
00:16:13,602 --> 00:16:15,103
I'm pregnant, Jerry.

200
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:20,509
Are you serious?

201
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:25,180
I thought, I thought my...

202
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:27,449
Your swimmers swim.

203
00:16:32,488 --> 00:16:34,690
Are you sure it's mine?

204
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:41,764
You know, I'm just not feeling

205
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:45,333
really well and
I'm just shocked.

206
00:16:47,135 --> 00:16:49,170
This is big news.

207
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:53,542
Right?

208
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:43,358
- Hey Trudy.
- Good morning, Jerry.

209
00:17:43,391 --> 00:17:44,693
You need to see
these new pictures...

210
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:46,060
Bye, Trudy.

211
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:50,265
Yo, buddy.

212
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:54,470
What?

213
00:17:54,503 --> 00:17:56,705
Oh come on, we
didn't drink that much.

214
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:58,607
You didn't.

215
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:02,076
After you got home?

216
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:10,084
So you told her, huh?

217
00:18:10,118 --> 00:18:11,052
No.

218
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:15,591
- She told me she's pregnant.
- What?

219
00:18:15,624 --> 00:18:17,292
Holy shit.

220
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:18,494
And she said I was having

221
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:20,629
some kind of wet
dream last night.

222
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:22,565
Apparently I was saying some
shit in my sleep, so she

223
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:25,433
flat out asked me this morning
if I fucked someone else.

224
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:28,436
And then she told me that

225
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,172
she bought me a
snowblower for my birthday

226
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:33,174
and the guy that's
she's been going to see

227
00:18:33,207 --> 00:18:34,409
down at the shopping
center she texts

228
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:36,645
is the goddamn fucking
salesman, Mike.

229
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:40,849
And you're buying that?

230
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:42,685
Who texts a snowblower salesman?

231
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:46,187
I don't know Mike, she's
my wife and I trust her

232
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,458
and now I cheated on her
because I listened to you.

233
00:18:49,491 --> 00:18:50,291
Whoa.

234
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:54,295
Do not blame me,
we were drinking.

235
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:55,764
You were sober
enough to drive.

236
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:57,566
We knew what the
fuck we were doing.

237
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:00,234
Jerry,

238
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:05,608
I'm gonna give you a little
piece of wisdom here, okay?

239
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:09,478
Just forget about it,
forget it ever happened.

240
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:11,145
Hey, the whole thing
was a wet dream.

241
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:14,817
Yeah, I mean it's not like

242
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,685
it was real pussy
anyway, was it?

243
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:19,722
It's kinda like
using one of those

244
00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:22,658
Fleshlights or jacking off
to porn, is that cheating?

245
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:25,928
That's a little
above my pay grade but

246
00:19:25,961 --> 00:19:28,897
just forget it ever
happened, all right?

247
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:30,666
So tell me where the place is.

248
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,168
Did you just miss
the whole conversation?

249
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:36,337
I said it never happened,
I said forget it.

250
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,774
Come on Mike, you owe me that.

251
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:40,241
I should've never

252
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:41,275
brought you there
in the first place.

253
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:43,277
Yeah, but you did.

254
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:28,924
You have
reached Mystic Wanda.

255
00:20:28,957 --> 00:20:31,325
I can't come to
the phone right now

256
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,229
due to unforeseen circumstances
but please leave your...

257
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:49,444
Oh, the clients called
about tomorrow's meeting.

258
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:50,746
Lunch.

259
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:52,481
It's a little early
for lunch, isn't it?

260
00:20:54,016 --> 00:20:55,818
What do you want me
to tell the clients?

261
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:58,020
Tell them I'm going to lunch.

262
00:20:58,053 --> 00:20:59,788
Is Mike going with you?

263
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,825
You fucking see Mike?

264
00:21:39,094 --> 00:21:40,829
I see that we're
running low on time now

265
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:43,599
but I think we've accomplished
a lot with this reading.

266
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:47,503
So I want you to take
what we've uncovered now

267
00:21:48,637 --> 00:21:50,539
and put that to good
use over the next

268
00:21:50,572 --> 00:21:52,808
couple of months and then
I will see you again.

269
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:56,812
I'll be right with you.

270
00:21:57,813 --> 00:22:00,381
Yeah, I'm on my lunch break,
I don't have a lot of time.

271
00:22:00,414 --> 00:22:02,551
- Then please sit down.
- No.

272
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:04,887
Can you just tell me where
to find Madame Zhora?

273
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:08,624
I don't know who
you're talking about.

274
00:22:08,657 --> 00:22:12,027
You're a psychic and you
can't find another psychic?

275
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,529
Great, you're all full
of shit, I get it.

276
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:16,765
Ring any bells, Morticia?

277
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,408
Just in case, just in case.

278
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:48,030
- Closed, come back later.
- No, no, wait.

279
00:22:48,063 --> 00:22:49,464
I'm here for the Special.

280
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:53,401
- Syn is not here.
- No, no Syn.

281
00:22:55,403 --> 00:22:56,337
The Special.

282
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:01,342
I seem to remember you.

283
00:23:03,812 --> 00:23:04,613
Your eyes.

284
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:07,348
I'll pay double.

285
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:48,583
- No, no.
- No.

286
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:07,669
No.

287
00:27:38,286 --> 00:27:39,621
What can I get ya?

288
00:27:42,023 --> 00:27:45,927
Hey, I was just wondering
if you have weekly rates here?

289
00:27:47,129 --> 00:27:48,964
Hmm, you look more
like a minute man to me.

290
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:51,833
We got hourly, we got weekly,

291
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:53,768
you can get six nights for 250.

292
00:27:55,137 --> 00:27:58,140
Yeah, that sounds
good, six nights.

293
00:27:59,174 --> 00:28:00,308
If you're on disability,

294
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:01,776
fill this out so
my ass gets paid.

295
00:28:03,078 --> 00:28:04,179
No, I don't need that.

296
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:07,082
Cash or card?

297
00:28:18,226 --> 00:28:19,861
Just use my card.

298
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:41,316
All right, you're
gonna be upstairs,

299
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:43,018
second door on the left.

300
00:28:44,252 --> 00:28:46,221
I got a couple simple
rules up in here.

301
00:28:47,322 --> 00:28:49,324
Piss and shit in the toilet,

302
00:28:49,357 --> 00:28:51,893
clean up your mess on the
bed or wherever you make it.

303
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:53,295
Don't leave that shit for me

304
00:28:54,763 --> 00:28:56,298
and when you return the
key, you don't bring it

305
00:28:56,331 --> 00:28:59,468
down here, you bring it
upstairs to me, got it?

306
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:01,036
- Yeah.
- Hey.

307
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,838
When you leave, take
the body with you.

308
00:29:06,174 --> 00:29:06,975
What?

309
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:41,936
Fuck.

310
00:31:05,427 --> 00:31:06,227
Okay.

311
00:31:07,195 --> 00:31:08,129
That's good.

312
00:31:09,665 --> 00:31:11,966
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

313
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,936
- You're the new guest here?
- Yeah I am, why?

314
00:31:14,969 --> 00:31:16,338
Do you want the room cleaned?

315
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:18,073
No, I don't need anything,
don't worry about it.

316
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:19,542
Don't change the towels,
don't change the bed.

317
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:21,076
Just don't come
in for any reason.

318
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:22,877
- The floor and the bathroom?
- No, no, nothing.

319
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:24,145
Nada, okay?

320
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:26,081
Just stay out of the
room, okay, all right?

321
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:28,249
Okay, I'll stay out
while you're there.

322
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:32,053
You don't go in
there for any reason.

323
00:31:32,087 --> 00:31:33,622
Not when I'm here,
not when I'm not here.

324
00:31:33,656 --> 00:31:35,990
What the fuck is
so hard about that?

325
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:38,960
Okay,
okay, I'll stay out.

326
00:31:38,993 --> 00:31:40,028
That a girl.

327
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,465
Fuck.

328
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:48,069
Come on in, please.

329
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:50,872
It's okay, I'll stay here.

330
00:31:57,613 --> 00:31:59,447
Where
are your employees?

331
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:00,915
It's just and Madame.

332
00:32:05,153 --> 00:32:07,456
And how long have
you worked for,

333
00:32:08,691 --> 00:32:11,192
I'm sorry, what's
her real name again?

334
00:32:12,427 --> 00:32:13,395
Anya Gribinsky.

335
00:32:14,597 --> 00:32:16,398
I have been with Madame always.

336
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:19,901
And what do you do for her?

337
00:32:21,704 --> 00:32:24,439
- Security and maintenance.
- Really?

338
00:32:25,674 --> 00:32:27,142
There's enough riff
raff in a fortune teller

339
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:29,244
joint to have a guy
like you as a bouncer?

340
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:33,181
This place has a smell.

341
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,184
When you've been
doing this for awhile,

342
00:32:36,217 --> 00:32:39,254
you can almost be blind
and know where you are.

343
00:32:39,287 --> 00:32:41,389
Yeah, locker rooms
have their own smell.

344
00:32:42,991 --> 00:32:46,060
Bowling alleys, strip clubs.

345
00:32:48,464 --> 00:32:49,998
Bodies give off pheromones,
did you know that?

346
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:56,104
Tell me Detective, what
is it that you smell?

347
00:33:00,241 --> 00:33:01,009
Tea,

348
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,011
cigarettes.

349
00:33:04,345 --> 00:33:05,146
Pussy.

350
00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:09,718
I tell you already,

351
00:33:09,752 --> 00:33:13,154
I go to the store and she knows

352
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:15,524
do not let anyone in
until Ivan returns.

353
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:18,126
But she does not listen.

354
00:33:19,495 --> 00:33:22,397
Anything else I do not know.

355
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:27,603
You have no idea who
could've done this?

356
00:33:27,636 --> 00:33:29,237
I am not the psychic.

357
00:33:36,044 --> 00:33:38,246
Kimosabe, where were you?

358
00:33:39,214 --> 00:33:40,649
- What do you mean?
- Lunch.

359
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:42,250
I came by, you
were already gone.

360
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:44,487
I just felt like being alone.

361
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,523
I got a lot on my mind,
if you haven't guessed.

362
00:33:47,556 --> 00:33:48,356
That's all?

363
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,992
Yeah Mike, that's all.

364
00:33:53,662 --> 00:33:55,063
All right.

365
00:33:55,096 --> 00:33:57,533
You know, no hard feelings.

366
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:59,702
Nope, forgotten already.

367
00:33:59,735 --> 00:34:00,603
Really?

368
00:34:01,837 --> 00:34:03,371
Isn't that what
you said I should do?

369
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:06,642
Yeah, but I didn't
think you actually would.

370
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:08,511
Yeah, well I am.

371
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:10,445
I gotta make things right
with Lisa and hopefully

372
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:13,047
in a week or two, everything
will be back to normal.

373
00:34:13,081 --> 00:34:14,215
Good place to start.

374
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,820
Wanna hit Mort's
after work tonight?

375
00:34:17,853 --> 00:34:22,090
No, I can't, I made reservations
with Lisa at Chang's.

376
00:34:23,492 --> 00:34:24,292
Have fun.

377
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:32,535
So where's your
drinking buddy tonight?

378
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:34,168
Ah, with the wife.

379
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:36,437
Where you should be.

380
00:34:37,606 --> 00:34:39,542
When are you gonna
get married, man?

381
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:42,778
Come on Mort, you know I'm
not the marrying type and in

382
00:34:42,811 --> 00:34:45,781
fact, I don't even think humans
are meant to be monogamous.

383
00:34:45,814 --> 00:34:47,583
You know males are
wired to spread

384
00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:50,451
their seed, like farm equipment.

385
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:51,419
Is that right?

386
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,823
Well then maybe I should've
been a farmer, huh?

387
00:34:54,857 --> 00:34:56,825
Yeah, maybe you should've.

388
00:34:56,859 --> 00:34:58,594
You okay with that
or you need another?

389
00:34:58,627 --> 00:35:00,094
- I'm fine.
- All right.

390
00:35:30,826 --> 00:35:34,597
We're downtown outside
of Anya Gribinsky's,

391
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:37,700
known locally as Madame
Zhora's Psychic Parlor where

392
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:42,538
police say Gribinsky, aged
72, was found dead upstairs.

393
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:44,673
While local authorities
have no comment,

394
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:46,875
foul play is suspected.

395
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:49,678
Reporting from downtown,
this is Nick Roberts.

396
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:51,112
Back to you, Susan.

397
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:18,232
Fuck!

398
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,407
Hey.

399
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:35,878
How'd it go?

400
00:38:36,845 --> 00:38:37,813
How'd what go?

401
00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:42,350
The reason you're late.

402
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:44,553
The meeting with Mr.
Rhyerson you called about.

403
00:38:44,586 --> 00:38:45,419
Oh yeah,

404
00:38:46,455 --> 00:38:47,823
it went fine.

405
00:38:48,924 --> 00:38:50,459
Is that really where you were?

406
00:38:53,061 --> 00:38:54,295
What do you mean?

407
00:38:55,998 --> 00:39:00,569
You weren't out drinking
with Mike or someone else?

408
00:39:00,602 --> 00:39:03,472
No, we talked
about this, remember?

409
00:39:04,673 --> 00:39:05,507
We're good.

410
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:09,845
Are we, Jerry?

411
00:39:14,983 --> 00:39:16,384
I'm not feeling well.

412
00:39:48,016 --> 00:39:49,450
What are you doing?

413
00:39:49,484 --> 00:39:50,819
I thought you were
watching your show.

414
00:39:52,154 --> 00:39:53,555
I am now.

415
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:57,693
I was just getting ready
to come out and surprise you.

416
00:39:59,828 --> 00:40:00,762
Surprise, surprise.

417
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:06,434
Jerry, slow.

418
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:18,947
Oh, Jerry.

419
00:40:32,794 --> 00:40:36,031
Oh, Jerry.

420
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:36,999
Oh, Jerry.

421
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:40,469
Slow.

422
00:40:40,502 --> 00:40:41,603
Jerry, Jerry.

423
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:06,595
- Where are you going?
- Work.

424
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:14,069
The Rhyerson thing's
put me way behind.

425
00:41:14,102 --> 00:41:15,237
I'd rather it cut into

426
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,672
my mornings than my
weekends, you know?

427
00:41:19,207 --> 00:41:20,575
I'll talk to you later.

428
00:42:12,694 --> 00:42:15,630
- This is Mike.
- Hi, Mike.

429
00:42:15,664 --> 00:42:16,698
Lisa, hey.

430
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:20,869
Sorry to
bother you at work but

431
00:42:20,902 --> 00:42:23,238
I was wondering if I could
talk to you about Jerry?

432
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:24,773
Okay, what about?

433
00:42:26,341 --> 00:42:28,643
Does he seem like
himself to you lately?

434
00:42:29,978 --> 00:42:30,812
How do you mean?

435
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,749
I don't know, it's just that

436
00:42:33,782 --> 00:42:36,651
he treated me like a one
night stand this morning.

437
00:42:36,685 --> 00:42:38,553
It's like he couldn't get
out of here quick enough.

438
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:42,758
Good morning, Mr. Horford.

439
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:45,594
No Frank, it's a
great fucking morning.

440
00:42:46,528 --> 00:42:47,996
Do you think
he's cheating, Mike?

441
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:49,865
No.

442
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:51,933
You know,

443
00:42:53,802 --> 00:42:55,670
if he is, he hasn't
told me about it.

444
00:42:56,905 --> 00:42:59,007
- You're late again.
- Not anymore.

445
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:00,909
I need to know if
this is an affair.

446
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,980
If you see or hear
anything suspicious,

447
00:43:05,013 --> 00:43:06,615
will you let me know?

448
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:08,817
Yeah, of course.

449
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:09,684
Sure.

450
00:43:12,921 --> 00:43:13,722
I hope so.

451
00:43:16,691 --> 00:43:18,960
Jeez, you look like shit.

452
00:43:20,062 --> 00:43:22,330
That my Lisa you
were talking to?

453
00:43:22,364 --> 00:43:25,634
Actually it was and
you know why she called?

454
00:43:26,802 --> 00:43:28,904
She thinks you're
having an affair.

455
00:43:28,937 --> 00:43:29,738
Are you?

456
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:31,973
Am I what?

457
00:43:32,808 --> 00:43:34,943
Just because you
want to fuck my wife

458
00:43:34,976 --> 00:43:37,212
doesn't mean you can talk
to her behind my back.

459
00:43:37,245 --> 00:43:38,980
Hey, she called me.

460
00:43:39,014 --> 00:43:40,882
Next
time, don't answer.

461
00:44:16,785 --> 00:44:20,255
So, you've come to tell me
that you found who did this.

462
00:44:20,288 --> 00:44:21,756
No, but I hear you've

463
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,091
been doing a little
search of your own.

464
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:25,727
But you found something.

465
00:44:26,995 --> 00:44:28,663
What we found is
a lot of things that

466
00:44:28,697 --> 00:44:31,099
can't be traced back to
anyone with a record.

467
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:32,033
I'm actually here
because I'm wondering

468
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:34,769
if whoever did this took
more than your boss.

469
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:37,038
My boss?

470
00:44:38,306 --> 00:44:39,207
Madame.

471
00:44:40,709 --> 00:44:43,645
Nothing was taken
but Madame's life.

472
00:44:48,316 --> 00:44:50,652
You ever have something
stuck in your tooth?

473
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:54,457
A piece of popcorn maybe

474
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,191
stuck in your teeth
way back here?

475
00:44:56,224 --> 00:44:58,293
No matter how much you pick
at it, it won't come out.

476
00:44:58,326 --> 00:44:59,661
You ever had that happen?

477
00:45:00,195 --> 00:45:01,062
I floss.

478
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:10,138
You don't seem
very concerned with

479
00:45:10,172 --> 00:45:13,175
whether or not we find whoever
did this to Ms. Gribinsky.

480
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:15,844
In fact, it's almost
as if you don't want us

481
00:45:15,877 --> 00:45:18,180
to catch this person and you
know what that makes me think?

482
00:45:19,814 --> 00:45:21,816
I am that's something
that's stuck in the tooth.

483
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:23,885
Exactly.

484
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:25,820
Yeah, exactly.

485
00:45:26,988 --> 00:45:30,959
Americans have a saying, "What
goes around, comes around."

486
00:45:32,827 --> 00:45:36,965
I think whoever did this
will get what they deserve.

487
00:45:40,835 --> 00:45:43,405
What's with the
occult books here, Ivan?

488
00:45:43,438 --> 00:45:44,607
Well, the occult
was her career.

489
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,009
Curses too, how much for
her to put a curse on someone?

490
00:45:49,077 --> 00:45:53,148
Madame did that for free,
I wish I had her powers.

491
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:55,951
I would curse the
man who did this.

492
00:45:55,984 --> 00:45:58,220
- So it was a man?
- I assume so, yes.

493
00:46:01,056 --> 00:46:04,392
Well Ivan, why
would a man frequent

494
00:46:04,426 --> 00:46:06,127
a fortune teller,
let alone kill one?

495
00:46:08,296 --> 00:46:09,764
Men want to know things too.

496
00:46:17,405 --> 00:46:18,273
Something's wrong?

497
00:46:20,976 --> 00:46:23,144
Yeah, you know, I find
a lot wrong actually.

498
00:46:24,379 --> 00:46:25,981
What was on this table again?

499
00:46:29,284 --> 00:46:30,118
A box.

500
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:32,787
I like working with wood.

501
00:46:34,356 --> 00:46:35,190
A box for what?

502
00:46:36,925 --> 00:46:38,126
For putting things in.

503
00:46:39,861 --> 00:46:41,096
And where is this box?

504
00:47:02,117 --> 00:47:02,984
Ah, fuck.

505
00:47:45,528 --> 00:47:47,362
Yeah Trudy, this is Jerry.

506
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,633
Can you tell Mr. Rolf I'm not
gonna make it back in today?

507
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:52,501
I'm really sick.

508
00:47:52,535 --> 00:47:54,302
Brian, the doctor
will see you now.

509
00:47:54,336 --> 00:47:57,839
Shit, yeah, sorry,
they're calling me in.

510
00:47:59,274 --> 00:48:00,241
Yeah, got it.

511
00:48:01,477 --> 00:48:03,945
- So you're married?
- Yes.

512
00:48:03,978 --> 00:48:06,147
You and your wife having
more sex than usual?

513
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:09,618
No, less than
usual actually, ow.

514
00:48:09,652 --> 00:48:11,086
Sorry.

515
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,589
Are you having sex with
anyone other than your wife?

516
00:48:13,622 --> 00:48:15,357
No.

517
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:17,959
- Are you sure.
- Unless I'm sleep-fucking no.

518
00:48:19,294 --> 00:48:20,962
- Fuck.
- Look.

519
00:48:20,995 --> 00:48:22,364
I can't help you if
you're not honest.

520
00:48:22,397 --> 00:48:24,966
I'm not having sex
with anyone else, no.

521
00:48:24,999 --> 00:48:27,369
So you're masturbating
more than usual?

522
00:48:27,402 --> 00:48:31,106
Unless I'm using a cheese
grater, I mean look at this.

523
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:33,942
I think it's spreading
and it comes and goes.

524
00:48:33,975 --> 00:48:35,977
It's all over my fucking
dick, man, what is this?

525
00:48:38,614 --> 00:48:40,181
I don't know.

526
00:48:40,215 --> 00:48:41,883
I'll tell you what, mister,

527
00:48:42,752 --> 00:48:46,121
Mr. Smith, whatever
it is that your penis

528
00:48:46,154 --> 00:48:48,390
and you are doing,
just do it less often.

529
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:52,927
I'm gonna write you a prescription
for some LMX ointment.

530
00:48:54,697 --> 00:48:57,031
Go ahead and put that
on a couple times a day.

531
00:48:57,966 --> 00:48:58,933
See if that works.

532
00:49:01,436 --> 00:49:02,404
Fuck you.

533
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,047
- Is it ready yet?
- Just a minute.

534
00:49:21,156 --> 00:49:22,491
You have a bathroom here?

535
00:49:24,993 --> 00:49:26,027
It's in the back.

536
00:49:33,401 --> 00:49:35,638
Do I need to tell
you how to use this?

537
00:49:35,671 --> 00:49:37,439
Yeah, just rub it
on my dick, right?

538
00:49:39,274 --> 00:49:41,209
Fuck.

539
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:48,950
Oh.

540
00:50:12,641 --> 00:50:13,576
Jerry?

541
00:50:47,843 --> 00:50:49,712
Jerry, what are you doing?

542
00:50:49,745 --> 00:50:51,212
I'm sick.

543
00:50:57,686 --> 00:50:59,153
You don't feel hot.

544
00:50:59,822 --> 00:51:01,155
You can say that again.

545
00:51:02,725 --> 00:51:04,425
Is there anything
I can do to help?

546
00:51:05,494 --> 00:51:08,129
No, I think I'm just
gonna try to sleep it off.

547
00:51:09,698 --> 00:51:11,299
I gotta get to work tomorrow.

548
00:51:16,271 --> 00:51:17,573
What kinda sick are you?

549
00:51:18,841 --> 00:51:22,243
I don't know, flu
sick, cold sick.

550
00:51:23,278 --> 00:51:24,045
Why?

551
00:51:28,617 --> 00:51:30,318
I think I miscarried.

552
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,192
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.

553
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:42,397
I'm sorry.

554
00:51:45,868 --> 00:51:47,168
You're sorry?

555
00:51:48,336 --> 00:51:50,238
- That's it?
- Where is this going?

556
00:51:54,677 --> 00:51:56,077
Lisa, I really need to sleep.

557
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,482
It's going nowhere.

558
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:02,383
Look, I don't have
a VD if that's what

559
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:05,654
you're asking because again,
I am not cheating on you.

560
00:52:09,758 --> 00:52:10,559
Lis, Lis.

561
00:52:14,563 --> 00:52:15,430
We could try again.

562
00:52:22,771 --> 00:52:23,572
We will.

563
00:52:28,176 --> 00:52:29,377
It'll be okay.

564
00:52:36,585 --> 00:52:37,385
Please,

565
00:52:38,487 --> 00:52:40,254
can I just get
some sleep please?

566
00:52:42,423 --> 00:52:43,257
Thanks.

567
00:54:23,859 --> 00:54:24,760
What the?

568
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:28,664
No, no, no, no.

569
00:54:35,938 --> 00:54:37,271
Shit.

570
00:54:38,807 --> 00:54:40,274
No, no, no, no.

571
00:55:06,735 --> 00:55:08,302
Good morning
sir, how are you?

572
00:55:09,638 --> 00:55:11,372
Anything I can help you with?

573
00:55:11,405 --> 00:55:13,274
No, no, I'm cool.

574
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:31,026
Can I help you find something?

575
00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:32,426
Yeah.

576
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:34,530
Yeah.

577
00:55:35,264 --> 00:55:38,934
I'm looking for, I don't
know what it's called.

578
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:40,434
Yeah, I need to cut a lock.

579
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:43,005
Like bolt cutters?

580
00:55:43,038 --> 00:55:45,808
Yeah, yeah, that'll work.

581
00:56:08,597 --> 00:56:09,898
How
big is the lock?

582
00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:11,365
Shit, like this big.

583
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:14,435
- These should work fine.
- Yeah.

584
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:16,471
They're
used, is that okay?

585
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,441
Yeah, it's fine, that'll work.

586
00:56:49,872 --> 00:56:51,640
Yeah Trudy, it's Jerry.

587
00:56:51,673 --> 00:56:54,743
Thanks, I'm afraid I'm
still not feeling so well.

588
00:56:54,776 --> 00:56:58,780
So yeah, okay Trudy, yeah
I will, all right, okay.

589
00:57:27,943 --> 00:57:28,744
Shh.

590
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:31,513
Shh.

591
00:58:30,138 --> 00:58:30,939
Fuck.

592
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:44,786
Fuck, fuck, ah.

593
00:58:46,254 --> 00:58:47,589
Ah, okay.

594
00:58:55,964 --> 00:58:56,765
Okay.

595
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,920
Hello?

596
00:59:19,988 --> 00:59:22,524
Hi Lisa, it's
Trudy from Mike's workplace.

597
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:25,694
Oh hi Trudy, how are you?

598
00:59:25,727 --> 00:59:26,962
I'm okay,

599
00:59:26,995 --> 00:59:28,997
I just wanted to call
and check on Jerry.

600
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:33,668
What do you mean,
he's not at work?

601
00:59:33,702 --> 00:59:35,537
No, he called
in sick, something...

602
00:59:42,344 --> 00:59:43,879
What the hell?

603
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:39,067
I'd like to
welcome the board back.

604
01:00:39,101 --> 01:00:40,969
I know I can do all
of your counting

605
01:00:41,002 --> 01:00:42,604
and don't worry about
it, I'm totally fine.

606
01:00:44,272 --> 01:00:45,941
- Yes, you are.
- As you say.

607
01:00:47,943 --> 01:00:49,244
Yeah, man.

608
01:00:49,277 --> 01:00:51,780
Okay, and
Parkington writes in his book

609
01:00:51,813 --> 01:00:54,616
a lot about his mental
problems specifically.

610
01:01:14,035 --> 01:01:17,038
I told you
no cleaning here.

611
01:01:20,175 --> 01:01:21,042
And why not?

612
01:01:26,781 --> 01:01:28,049
Lisa?

613
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:30,852
Jerry.

614
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:34,256
What are
you doing here?

615
01:01:35,323 --> 01:01:36,725
What do you think?

616
01:01:36,758 --> 01:01:37,659
Open the door.

617
01:01:38,393 --> 01:01:40,028
Just wait a minute.

618
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,999
Now Jerry or I swear to God

619
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:46,301
I'm gonna scream rape
at the top of my lungs.

620
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:48,471
One second.

621
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:49,871
Jerry.

622
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:58,747
Fuck, Jesus Christ,
it stinks in here.

623
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:03,952
- It's an old room.
- No.

624
01:02:06,221 --> 01:02:06,988
Something stinks.

625
01:02:09,424 --> 01:02:10,759
Is it her?

626
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:14,829
Who?

627
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:18,200
The girl you're
cheating on me with.

628
01:02:18,233 --> 01:02:19,868
At least I hope it's a girl.

629
01:02:19,901 --> 01:02:22,938
Lisa, we talked about this,
there's nothing going on.

630
01:02:22,971 --> 01:02:24,973
You're gonna deny it
even though I caught you?

631
01:02:27,442 --> 01:02:28,777
You're pathetic.

632
01:02:30,845 --> 01:02:32,515
Where is she?

633
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:35,850
Did she go in the bathroom now?

634
01:02:35,884 --> 01:02:37,719
Don't go in there.

635
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:39,988
I wonder why.

636
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:44,159
How could you, Jerry?

637
01:02:44,192 --> 01:02:46,027
How could you?

638
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:48,163
- Get off me.
- Lisa, no.

639
01:02:48,196 --> 01:02:49,764
Get off me, get off.

640
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:51,299
Oh, fuck!

641
01:03:01,843 --> 01:03:04,145
What the hell is that?

642
01:05:34,095 --> 01:05:37,065
Not so much just that
first experience is that they

643
01:05:37,098 --> 01:05:40,001
like it enough to keep doing
it and then it's hard to stop.

644
01:05:40,034 --> 01:05:42,505
Listen, you do stuff
and you don't do stuff

645
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:46,509
and you do stuff that keeps
on making you feel good

646
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:49,344
until it doesn't make you feel
good and you stop doing it.

647
01:05:49,377 --> 01:05:50,713
That's what I tell
the kids, you know?

648
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:52,113
But the problem is,

649
01:05:52,147 --> 01:05:53,381
and as the Lord is
a witness to it,

650
01:05:57,686 --> 01:06:00,021
you keep doing it
and you'll die.

651
01:06:01,189 --> 01:06:03,391
But with the stuff that
you've been doing...

652
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:18,039
I don't know we keep
talking about my drug use.

653
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:52,073
I mean like it's just
that's the message

654
01:06:52,106 --> 01:06:54,477
that I'm giving you right
now as we're talking.

655
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,478
I understand that.

656
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,079
When I see people that
are playing video games

657
01:06:58,112 --> 01:07:00,315
or doing heroin, it
doesn't seem like

658
01:07:00,348 --> 01:07:02,450
they're having fun
or living their life

659
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:05,353
best suited to help
make them feel good

660
01:07:05,386 --> 01:07:08,323
and it ends up
making you feel bad.

661
01:07:10,158 --> 01:07:11,426
Fuck.

662
01:07:40,288 --> 01:07:42,290
Hey, hey, I'm
Dick, how are ya?

663
01:07:45,093 --> 01:07:46,194
You're Jerry, right?

664
01:07:47,195 --> 01:07:49,063
Yeah, yeah, I'm Jerry.

665
01:07:49,097 --> 01:07:50,533
- Cool.
- Yeah.

666
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:52,501
Well if you can just put
your initials on there for me?

667
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,606
- So you're the guy.
- Excuse me?

668
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:00,441
You're the guy.

669
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:02,443
I'm the guy.

670
01:08:06,381 --> 01:08:07,583
Is your wife on her way here?

671
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:09,150
No, she's not on her way here.

672
01:08:09,183 --> 01:08:10,753
She asked me to meet you, so...

673
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:12,655
- Oh.
- Yeah.

674
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:14,389
Right, yeah.

675
01:08:14,422 --> 01:08:16,291
Hey, why don't I
give you a once over?

676
01:08:16,324 --> 01:08:20,094
Hey Dick, I can read a manual
and figure it out myself.

677
01:08:20,128 --> 01:08:23,666
It's a snowblower, it's
not blowing me, is it?

678
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:28,236
- So where do you want it?
- We bought the stupid thing

679
01:08:28,269 --> 01:08:30,171
so you can drop the whole
bullshit salesman act, okay?

680
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,108
Yeah, right Jerry, no problem.

681
01:08:34,142 --> 01:08:36,344
If you could just give
me your initials here?

682
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:43,217
Great, thanks.

683
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:23,592
Shh.

684
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:18,514
Fuck.

685
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:07,388
So out with
the wife again, is he?

686
01:12:07,421 --> 01:12:09,491
Nope, he called in sick today.

687
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:19,802
Hey Mort, turn the volume
up on that TV, hurry, hurry.

688
01:12:20,434 --> 01:12:21,570
Authorities have not released

689
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:23,672
a list of suspects at this time.

690
01:12:23,705 --> 01:12:25,574
With more information
on this story,

691
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:30,378
I have Ivan Marovich,
caretaker at Madame Zhora's.

692
01:12:31,713 --> 01:12:34,448
Whoever did this, I
hope you are watching now.

693
01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:36,885
I know what is happening to you

694
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,689
and I am the only
one who can help you.

695
01:12:40,722 --> 01:12:43,859
So when you are ready
to accept my help,

696
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:46,862
I will be here waiting for you.

697
01:12:53,735 --> 01:12:56,905
- Did you clean up?
- It's clean enough.

698
01:12:57,906 --> 01:12:58,907
Move out, scoot.

699
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:07,482
You know, you really
don't look like

700
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:10,451
the usual type of person I
get coming through this place.

701
01:13:10,485 --> 01:13:12,855
It's a pretty high
class place you got here.

702
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:13,822
That's real funny.

703
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,458
No, I just mean
like you don't look

704
01:13:16,491 --> 01:13:19,695
like a meth head or
some sloshed up drunk.

705
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,396
What'd you do, molest somebody
and you're hiding out?

706
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:23,799
Did you kill someone?

707
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:25,601
Hey look, don't get me
wrong, I don't give a fuck

708
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:27,636
one way or the other but they
come up in here to get you,

709
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:29,638
I'm just gonna say I
didn't know anything.

710
01:13:31,506 --> 01:13:33,909
- I took some towels.
- Take 'em.

711
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:36,912
Hell, you want my opinion,
you oughta burn 'em.

712
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:38,013
You can charge me for them.

713
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:39,915
What, for cum rags?

714
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:41,016
You'll ruin the house, man.

715
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:41,917
Okay, all right.

716
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:44,553
Get out.

717
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:04,405
Anybody home?

718
01:14:06,174 --> 01:14:07,542
Hello?

719
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:09,912
Lisa?

720
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,416
Are you home?

721
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:30,465
Lisa?

722
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:38,006
Lisa?

723
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:45,547
Lisa, are you in there?

724
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:57,526
What the fuck?

725
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:09,571
Fuck.

726
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:37,532
Lisa,

727
01:15:39,267 --> 01:15:40,736
are you in here?

728
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:58,053
What the fuck did you do?

729
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:27,182
This is not what I
expected, what's up, Mike?

730
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:28,150
Jerry.

731
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:30,685
Hey, jeez.

732
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:34,089
- You look like shit.
- Why, this?

733
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:35,690
Yeah, it's just a rash.

734
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:37,159
The doc gave me some
kind of ointment,

735
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:40,128
he said it'll be all right,
it's pretty gross, right?

736
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:43,198
Is that from that thing,
that thing in the tub?

737
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,032
What?

738
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:47,235
That's what that
guy was talking about.

739
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,037
What who was talking about?

740
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,807
That guy, the big guy
from Madame Zhora's.

741
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,276
He was on the TV, she's
dead you know and he said

742
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:58,647
whoever did it, he's got
something that can fix it.

743
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:01,249
Was it you?

744
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,784
Come on Mike, you
believe that shit?

745
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:04,686
He's just trying
to trick me into

746
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:07,689
coming to him so he can
turn me in to the police.

747
01:17:07,722 --> 01:17:10,225
Okay, let's get
you to the hospital.

748
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:11,626
No, no, no hospital.

749
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,095
- I'm gonna stay here.
- Jerry, look.

750
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:14,763
How'd you get in here?

751
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,865
Your garage door was
open, it's always open.

752
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:20,035
Since when do you think you
can just walk into my house?

753
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:22,370
Hey, I'm just here
to help you, man.

754
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:24,005
Help?

755
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:26,241
I mean it's a little
late for that.

756
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:28,343
- Listen.
- Isn't it?

757
01:17:28,376 --> 01:17:30,245
Listen Jerry, if
you had anything to do

758
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,747
with Madame Zhora's death,
don't worry about it,

759
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:34,649
we'll cover it up,
tie up loose ends.

760
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:36,785
You can trust me,
I'm your buddy.

761
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:39,187
And Lisa?

762
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:42,624
What about Lisa?

763
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:44,726
She got in the way.

764
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,132
No.

765
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:50,932
No, Jerry, no.

766
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,068
Hey, did you forget?

767
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:55,337
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

768
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:56,872
Telling me to
cheat on my wife.

769
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:58,140
Is that your idea of help?

770
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,375
I said one time, one
and done, don't go back.

771
01:18:00,408 --> 01:18:02,177
You didn't listen, fuck!

772
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,064
Hey.

773
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:58,900
Hey.

774
01:18:58,934 --> 01:18:59,701
Shh.

775
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,771
He didn't hurt you, did he?

776
01:19:04,105 --> 01:19:04,906
Hey.

777
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:08,777
Come here.

778
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:12,881
Come here, beautiful.

779
01:19:18,554 --> 01:19:19,888
You okay?

780
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:32,127
I'll be back later.

781
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:43,405
Are you feeling okay?

782
01:21:09,964 --> 01:21:12,200
Happy birthday!

783
01:21:13,502 --> 01:21:14,869
What are you doing here?

784
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:15,970
It's your birthday.

785
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:18,306
It is?

786
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,375
Are you okay, Jerry?

787
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:21,443
Is that a rash?

788
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:23,579
I'm sick.

789
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:26,915
Oh, you poor baby.

790
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:28,083
But you can't be that sick

791
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:30,285
because your wife didn't
call us and cancel.

792
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:33,221
- She's sick too.
- Can we see her?

793
01:21:33,254 --> 01:21:34,889
No, she's sleeping,
we both were.

794
01:21:36,692 --> 01:21:39,894
Look, thanks for coming,
I really appreciate it.

795
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:43,064
But I'm sorry we
didn't call you guys

796
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:46,569
but the party's canceled and
you can just go now, thanks.

797
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:48,336
- What do you mean?
- Come on, Jerry.

798
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:49,672
We've been looking
forward to this all week.

799
01:21:49,705 --> 01:21:51,239
Would you just
get off my property?

800
01:21:51,272 --> 01:21:52,140
I thought your
wife was sleeping.

801
01:21:52,173 --> 01:21:54,275
George,
fuck off, both of you.

802
01:21:54,309 --> 01:21:57,145
All of you, just get outta
here, get off my property.

803
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:00,483
- I'm sick.
- Yeah, clearly.

804
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:00,034
I see you
got my message.

805
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:01,302
Can you really help me?

806
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:03,271
Of course.

807
01:24:04,807 --> 01:24:06,441
Is this what you took from us?

808
01:24:06,475 --> 01:24:09,979
- It is dead?
- No, I mean yeah.

809
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:13,281
I don't know, I think it is.

810
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:16,451
Can you fix it?

811
01:24:22,423 --> 01:24:23,559
Come with me.

812
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,499
What are we doing in here?

813
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:34,335
Sit down, try to relax

814
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:37,238
while I see what I can
do about our friend.

815
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:40,174
Wait, for what it's
worth, I'm really sorry.

816
01:24:41,644 --> 01:24:45,146
Listen, to make up for it,
the business that you lost,

817
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:47,816
I used part of it
on me with my wife

818
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:51,185
and it like rocked
her world, man.

819
01:24:52,186 --> 01:24:54,188
It works inside a woman?

820
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:56,124
I tried a little bit but it
does nothing for the girl.

821
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:58,727
No, no, I put it on me first

822
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:00,563
and it all happened
inside of her.

823
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,398
But who cares about what
it does for the girls?

824
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,534
It's all about the guys, right?

825
01:25:05,568 --> 01:25:09,203
They're your customer, as long
as it satisfies him, right?

826
01:25:10,171 --> 01:25:12,173
A little bit of the
Special with my girls.

827
01:25:12,206 --> 01:25:14,175
- Something to think about.
- Yes.

828
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:16,679
I mean maybe we
could work together.

829
01:25:16,712 --> 01:25:17,880
I can help, we could be partners

830
01:25:17,913 --> 01:25:22,083
or something and I
can be with it again.

831
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,855
Do not worry, you
will be with it again soon.

832
01:25:26,889 --> 01:25:29,792
So you'll be able to help it?

833
01:25:29,825 --> 01:25:32,561
Of course, I will get started.

834
01:25:32,595 --> 01:25:35,464
- Better if you relax now.
- Yes, thank you.

835
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:45,326
You said you'd help me.

836
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:52,366
You said you'd help me.

837
01:28:37,012 --> 01:28:38,379
No.

838
01:28:38,881 --> 01:28:39,815
No.

839
01:29:56,592 --> 01:29:58,594
Guess I could've
been the new psychic.

840
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,864
I saw this one
coming a mile away.

841
01:30:03,165 --> 01:30:04,900
So you are here
to arrest me then?

842
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08,070
Actually I'm here
because the money

843
01:30:08,103 --> 01:30:10,672
we found in Madame Zhora's
hand yielded DNA evidence.

844
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:15,644
Jerry Horford, he
sound familiar?

845
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:18,379
I do not know him.

846
01:30:18,981 --> 01:30:20,582
Well we think he was here.

847
01:30:20,616 --> 01:30:22,517
We think he may have
killed Madame Zhora.

848
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:32,728
You like what you see?

849
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:41,003
Maybe something
less compromising.

850
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:47,743
What are you implying?

851
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:50,479
Let me offer you
something better.

852
01:30:52,481 --> 01:30:55,651
Let me give you the
Special, no charge.

853
01:33:39,081 --> 01:33:42,684
So I just got back from my
stand up gig, you know the one.

854
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:44,352
Remember I told you
John van Tongeren

855
01:33:44,386 --> 01:33:46,121
and Michael Sweet
were in the crowd?

856
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:50,225
Well listen, you guys
have to come back with me.

857
01:33:50,258 --> 01:33:52,127
It was incredible.

858
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:55,130
After my set, this guy told me
to go to this fortune teller.

859
01:33:56,198 --> 01:33:58,200
Listen, it's like a whorehouse.

860
01:33:58,233 --> 01:34:00,335
I was drinking with this guy

861
01:34:00,368 --> 01:34:02,671
and he told me to
ask for the Special.

862
01:34:02,789 --> 01:34:04,625
