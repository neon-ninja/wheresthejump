someone's head off.

was an architect.

169
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:48,877
This brilliant architect. Okay?

170
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,746
He designed all these famous
buildings across the United States

171
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:54,350
including, actually the
first skyscraper in Chicago

172
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:57,286
and that amazing building
in New York City,

173
00:08:57,288 --> 00:09:02,924
the Flatiron. Anyway, his
real passion was wine.

174
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:05,861
Danny Burnham shipped his
around the world, twice,

175
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:09,798
on these slow freighters.
So, sometimes the wine

176
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,102
would take years, and years,
and years to come back to him.

177
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:17,105
Anyway, one day, me and my wife,

178
00:09:17,107 --> 00:09:19,975
we're in this really beautiful building
that Burnham designed in like,

179
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,776
nineteen hundred and something.

180
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:27,681
And we come across five
old, beautiful, dusty cases

181
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:30,184
of Daniel Burnham's wine.
The point is,

182
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:34,321
whenever Daniel Burnham opened a bottle
of his wine amongst his buddies,

183
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,403
he would read them the long
list of all the countries

184
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:38,759
that each specific
bottle had traveled,

185
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:42,363
so whenever they drank it they
knew it wasn't just a sip

186
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:45,266
of beautiful wine,

187
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:47,736
this was a trip around
the motherfucking world.

188
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,808
This wine is my only
connection to the past, Joe.

189
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,779
To the world as it was.

190
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:01,215
Remember that.

191
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:05,187
You know, Joe, I've forgotten
what fresh air feels like.

192
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:09,856
And sunlight. I hate this place.

193
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:11,424
I hate seeing you
people in pain.

194
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:13,126
I hate not being
able to help you,

195
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:17,864
but I wanna understand you, Joe.
I do.

196
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:19,832
<b></b> <i>Looks like we're making
real progress in there.</i>

197
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:21,334
Shit.

198
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:23,303
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

199
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:25,438
Don't make me. Come on, man.
Take it easy.

200
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,939
I wanna help you.

201
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:31,910
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Listen to me!

202
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:33,714
What is wrong with you?

203
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:37,417
I'm trying to make progress in there.
What is it with this dude?

204
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,351
- Are you all right?
- No. Yeah. I'm fine.

205
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:42,187
- What's he keep saying in there?
- For me to go fuck myself.

206
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:43,989
<b></b> Tell him we'd all
do that if we could.

207
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:45,791
<b></font></b> Why are you coddling
that son of a bitch?

208
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:47,459
Please, Colonel.

209
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:49,096
When was the last Halloween?

210
00:10:50,164 --> 00:10:51,863
Last October.

211
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:53,332
No, that we celebrated.

212
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:55,970
Oh. Um, a year and a half ago.

213
00:10:57,238 --> 00:10:59,173
My Tommy was Spiderman.

214
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,141
- I want some answers.
- Back off, Colonel.

215
00:11:03,143 --> 00:11:05,479
- What is the problem?
- Colonel, there is no problem.

216
00:11:05,713 --> 00:11:07,633
I just need the subject to calm down.
That's all.

217
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:09,414
Bullshit. Get him back inside

218
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,049
and show that monster who's
in charge, or I will.

219
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:14,320
- That's enough, Colonel.
- This guy, man.

220
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:18,889
You're damn right it is.

221
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:22,026
- What's he doing?
- Colonel!

222
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:23,194
- Hey! Hey!
- What?

223
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:30,101
Now, he looks pretty
damn calm to me.

224
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:31,383
What the fuck is wrong with you?

225
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:32,869
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

226
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:35,206
- He was wasting our time.
- He was from Minnesota.

227
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,806
He was infected Halloween night,

228
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:38,648
that predates any previous
record of infection.

229
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:41,445
He might, he just might, have
been a link to Patient Zero.

230
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:43,514
<b><font face="Rockwell" color="#D900D9">Get your hands off me.

231
00:11:43,516 --> 00:11:45,284
You're gonna shoot me, Colonel?

232
00:11:47,986 --> 00:11:50,989
There are a million
more just like him.

233
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:53,156
What the...

234
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:55,358
Put the fucking wine away.
Clean up this shit.

235
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
- You're an asshole.
- Let's bring in the next one.

236
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,230
You were born an asshole, and you
will fucking die an asshole.

237
00:12:00,232 --> 00:12:05,502
I hate this fucking place!

238
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:07,437
You overstep your
authority like that again

239
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,172
and I'll have you
stripped of your command.

240
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:12,074
- My orders...
- Your orders are to protect

241
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:15,311
my laboratory. What we do
here is scientific research,

242
00:12:15,313 --> 00:12:18,548
not executions. You shot
him to get even with me.

243
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,482
Don't even think
about denying it.

244
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:22,985
You're upset that I put you down
and spoke to you like a child.

245
00:12:22,987 --> 00:12:25,454
But I have no choice when you
continue to act like a child.

246
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:27,323
I get that you're frustrated,

247
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:30,159
that you're posted to a scientific
operation and not a military one.

248
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:33,962
I understand, but you do
something like that again

249
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:36,532
and I promise you will rue
the day that we ever met,

250
00:12:36,534 --> 00:12:39,069
if you don't already.
Are we clear, Colonel?

251
00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:49,212
I'll take that as a yes.

252
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:58,486
He was traveling in a much
larger pack than normal today.

253
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:00,188
250, he said, you know.

254
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,030
A wolf-pack stays big
enough to hunt as a team,

255
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:03,591
but small enough
to feed everybody.

256
00:13:03,593 --> 00:13:06,561
And 250 is not a pack,
it's a goddamn army.

257
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,563
I'd like you to calm down.
Take a couple of these.

258
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:11,532
No! No! I cannot
take any more pills.

259
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:13,401
It's driving me insane.

260
00:13:13,403 --> 00:13:16,537
I keep having these nightmares.
These vivid flashbacks.

261
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:18,341
Stay still, I'm gonna
take your pulse.

262
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:22,510
Yes, flashbacks, okay. Go on.

263
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:26,980
I can hear her scream,
but I can't, I just... <b></b>

264
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:28,515
I can't reach her, you know.

265
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,453
- Stop torturing yourself.
- That's all I do. Torture myself.

266
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:34,223
Stop.

267
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:39,559
You know Janet and
I had this thing.

268
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:41,428
We never liked saying
goodbye to each other

269
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,132
because it sounds so permanent.

270
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,566
So instead of saying goodbye,

271
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:49,671
we would pick a random
topic from the alphabet.

272
00:13:50,972 --> 00:13:53,339
And we would recycle
through all 26 letters

273
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:55,910
over and over again, but we
would never say the words,

274
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:59,013
- "Goodbye."
- That's cute.

275
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,649
Yeah.

276
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:04,018
Yeah, that's cute.

277
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,923
Don't you miss that? Don't
you miss being cute?

278
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:14,195
Being human? Hell, yeah.

279
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:19,132
You're fine.

280
00:15:32,237 --> 00:15:33,606
Hope you're being safe.

281
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:35,639
Excuse me.

282
00:15:35,641 --> 00:15:38,474
Is it advisable to consort with
someone who's been bitten,

283
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:40,543
from a scientific perspective?

284
00:15:40,545 --> 00:15:42,411
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

285
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:45,147
Or maybe this is some
perverse line of research.

286
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:47,619
I don't know. You tell me.

287
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,556
- Oh, my God. That's it.
- What?

288
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:57,795
You're upset that I care
for Morgan, aren't you?

289
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:03,398
- Excuse me?
- Colonel, I wouldn't have chosen you

290
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,302
if you were the
last man on Earth.

291
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:09,104
You know the first
thing they teach

292
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:10,426
a ranger about
counter-insurgence?

293
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,820
Oh, please enlighten me.

294
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:15,477
When confronted with a group
of suspected terrorists,

295
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:18,048
and one in that group is a
woman, you take her out first.

296
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:22,319
You know why?

297
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:26,254
Because you never
can trust a bitch.

298
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:28,090
Is that a threat, Colonel?

299
00:16:29,693 --> 00:16:31,160
Just sharing.

300
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,833
- You know why I think that is?
- No. Let's hear it.

301
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:42,603
Because women always have to
work harder to prove themselves.

302
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:44,706
Consequently, they
invariably become smarter

303
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,207
and more dangerous than
their male counterparts.

304
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:50,079
- Is that a threat, Doctor?
- Just sharing.

305
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:39,358
Hey.

306
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,795
Don't do that.

307
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:45,567
Look, we need to see
if it's working.

308
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:49,136
Please.

309
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:52,807
You gotta keep taking it, okay?
Please.

310
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:09,155
Sometimes I can hear the music.

311
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,587

You tell that to the guy who contracted
HIV by fucking that rhesus monkey.

317
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,234
That was never proven.

318
00:18:58,236 --> 00:19:00,637

self-respecting monkey

Place of birth?

You like that? You like The Who?
Boom!

435
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:48,451
You know, music has an
interesting effect on you guys.

436
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:52,488
Your auditory system has been changed.
You can't process harmony.

437
00:27:52,721 --> 00:27:55,021
No harmony anymore.
I mean, music.

438
00:27:55,023 --> 00:27:59,125
The one good thing that we actually
have left and you even screw that up.

439
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:00,887
And after what you did
to my friend, Scooter,

440
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:03,547
I got no reason not to play you
every goddamn record that I own.

I got soul, I got hip-hop.

442

Oh, okay. That feel good?
That feel nice?

00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:19,481
Yeah? Place of birth?

447
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:24,484
- Over a year ago, October.
- October? You sure?

448
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:26,419
It was the day
before my birthday.

449
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:28,988
- My wife bit me.
- Where?

450
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,990
- At home.
- And where's home?

451
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:32,260
Saint Paul.

452
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,866
- You know anything about Patient Zero?
- Who?

453
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,034
The first Infected.

454
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:44,336
- You mean the original?
- The original, yeah.

455
00:28:44,338 --> 00:28:47,339
Do you know where he is?
You know where he is.

456
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:49,073
You wanna listen to
some more music?

457
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:52,010
Go ahead. Play your
fucking music.

458
00:28:52,012 --> 00:28:55,079
It didn't save your friend.
It won't save you.

459
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:56,950

The only person who made me laugh

Do it. Do it.

475
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:49,568
Do it.

476
00:29:52,137 --> 00:29:56,239
<b></font></b> <i>Both subjects were turned a year
and a half ago in Minnesota.</i>

477
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:58,207
Which crucially leads
us to believe...

478
00:29:58,209 --> 00:30:02,211
So might one of them
be this Patient Zero?

479
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:06,115
Uh, no, sir, both were
turned by another Infected,

480
00:30:06,117 --> 00:30:10,353
but Patient Zero could be a part
of this early Minnesota pack.

481
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:13,055
What we need to do
is expand our search

482
00:30:13,057 --> 00:30:15,324
around the area where we
found both patients today.

483
00:30:15,326 --> 00:30:18,294
Why should we believe anything
one of them tells us?

484
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:20,096
Because they don't lie, sir.

485
00:30:20,098 --> 00:30:22,338
Are you saying that they have
some sort of moral compass?

486
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,698
No, sir, our studies tell us that
there is no such thing as deceit

487
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:27,636
among the Infected.

488
00:30:27,638 --> 00:30:30,907
Their responses, though almost
always violent, are always truthful.

489
00:30:32,377 --> 00:30:33,942
Why is that?

490
00:30:33,944 --> 00:30:36,311
Well, we're still studying
their neural control center

491
00:30:36,313 --> 00:30:38,146
to determine that, sir,
but I can tell you...

492
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:40,248
We can't risk any more soldiers

493
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,484
on another low
percentage mission.

494
00:30:42,486 --> 00:30:44,185
That's what it all
boils down to.

495
00:30:44,187 --> 00:30:47,522
We cannot reverse-engineer a
vaccine without Patient Zero.

496
00:30:47,524 --> 00:30:49,023
And there's no
plan B, gentlemen.

497
00:30:49,025 --> 00:30:51,192
No Plan B doesn't mean
we have a good Plan A.

498
00:30:51,194 --> 00:30:52,927
I was right about Vegas.

499
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:56,398
I gave Colonel Knox a report saying
that we're seeing more and more

500
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,933
evolution in the adaptive and
strategic behavior of the Infected.

501
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:03,371
It stated that as long as the
Vegas facility was exposed,

502
00:31:03,373 --> 00:31:04,851
then the Infected were
bound to find a way in.

503
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,073
I dealt with it in the way
it was warranted, sir.

504
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:07,635
Colonel Knox chose to
shelve the report.

505
00:31:07,637 --> 00:31:08,871
It was speculation at best.

506
00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:11,412
And it played out
exactly as I predicted.

507
00:31:11,414 --> 00:31:13,615
<b></b> This has nothing to do with
what we're talking about.

508
00:31:13,617 --> 00:31:15,817
This has everything to do with
what we're talking about.

509
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,985
I keep trying to tell you,

510
00:31:17,987 --> 00:31:22,256
the Infected are not just sick
people suffering from a deficit.

511
00:31:22,258 --> 00:31:26,493
Something new, smart and
dangerous is evolving, sir.

512
00:31:26,495 --> 00:31:28,662
- They're learning.
<b></font></b>- They're learning, exactly.

513
00:31:28,664 --> 00:31:32,232
She's right, they're learning.
They're developing new strategies.

514
00:31:32,234 --> 00:31:34,554
- They're becoming more aware.
- Traveling in larger packs.

515
00:31:34,578 --> 00:31:36,969
Exactly. Like, how much longer
do you think it's gonna be

516
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:39,542
until they realize that we're down here?
It's happening.

517
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,247
Sir.

518
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,685
You're right.

519
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:55,988
It sounds like
actionable intel to me.

520
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,091
- Oh, no. Respectfully, sir...
- She was right about Vegas.

521
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:00,326
Thank you, sir.

522
00:32:00,328 --> 00:32:02,228
Thousands of people
died in that base,

523
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,500
which is not something you should
be proud of being right about.

524
00:32:06,601 --> 00:32:09,100
What's Cheyenne got to say?

525
00:32:09,102 --> 00:32:10,670
Comm links with NORAD
and USNORTHCOM

526
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:12,707
Alternate Command are
still down, sir.

527
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:15,508
Dispatch squads for
thorough sweep.

528
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,479
- Sir.
- Time is running out.

529
00:32:20,514 --> 00:32:22,216
Anderson.

530
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:26,153
Pull the trigger.

531
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:30,290
Good job.

532
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:34,194
That guy is an asshole.

533
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:07,493
We could have a
baby, me and you.

534
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,632
Come on, Janet, what? You're not
gonna talk about this ever?

535
00:33:14,634 --> 00:33:17,133
Because I know how much
you want your own child.

536
00:33:17,135 --> 00:33:19,168
That's not true. I...

537
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,504
I want a child with you.

538
00:33:21,506 --> 00:33:24,675
You know I love you for saying that.
But you know it is.

539
00:33:24,677 --> 00:33:29,078
You know, we agreed we'd wait until
we could afford a surrogate.

540
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,581
Baby, there are so many kids
out there that need a home.

541
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:35,485
- What? What are you...
- Eat your pad thai.

542
00:33:43,361 --> 00:33:45,229
<b></font></b>I heard gunshots earlier.

543
00:33:46,665 --> 00:33:48,733
Oh, no. That's nothing.

544
00:33:51,036 --> 00:33:52,702
It didn't sound like nothing.

545
00:33:52,704 --> 00:33:54,436
It's business as usual.

546
00:33:54,438 --> 00:33:56,358
Well, I don't know what
"business as usual" means

547
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:58,140
because you never
tell me anything.

548
00:33:58,142 --> 00:34:00,777
Well, trust me, you don't wanna
know because it's ugly out there.

549
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,411
It's uglier in here.

550
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,117
You know how in the movies

551
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,720
when there's an alien invasion,
everybody comes together

552
00:34:11,722 --> 00:34:13,755
to defeat a common enemy?

553
00:34:13,757 --> 00:34:15,657
It turns out real
life is a little more

554
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,829
complicated than that, you know.

555
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:24,198
Everybody wants to kill everybody
else for food or shelter.

556
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,102
There's more that's complicated.

557
00:34:28,137 --> 00:34:29,740
Is it the doctor?

558
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:32,408
I can sense it.

559
00:34:35,778 --> 00:34:37,380
She's pretty.

560
00:34:37,847 --> 00:34:40,314
Janet.

561
00:34:40,316 --> 00:34:43,353
You know, I took for granted the
simple things that made me human.

562
00:34:44,354 --> 00:34:45,786
Like tears.

563
00:34:45,788 --> 00:34:48,356
- Hey, you are everything to me.
- Not everything.

564
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:50,658
- Baby, listen to me.
- I'm not your baby!

565
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,259
- Hey. Janet.
- I'm one of them!

566
00:34:53,261 --> 00:34:56,196
I know you don't wanna hear
this, but when I was out there,

567
00:34:56,198 --> 00:34:57,900
I liked it.

568
00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:00,533
- The simplicity, the freedom.
- No. No.

569
00:35:00,535 --> 00:35:02,872
- The violence. You have to let me go.
- No.

570
00:35:03,138 --> 00:35:05,741
- Please, stay away from me. Please.
- No.

571
00:35:09,378 --> 00:35:11,511
You gotta promise me

572
00:35:11,513 --> 00:35:13,680
that you're not gonna give up.

573
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:15,649
Because we are getting
somewhere here.

574
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:17,352
The treatment is working.

575
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,320
There's still hope.

576
00:35:20,322 --> 00:35:23,492
Don't you give up. Okay?

577
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,828
And I love you.

578
00:35:35,436 --> 00:35:36,838
All right.

579
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,175
W is for Waltz.

580
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,377
Remember when we took
that ballroom dance class

581
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:47,281
and fell all over each other?

582
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:04,663
- I gotta go. Bye.
- No. Don't leave me.

583
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,665
- Don't, don't, don't.
- Where did we leave off?

584
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,902
Uh... What, it's R-S-T.
I think it's your turn.

585
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:12,439
- T. T. T. T.
- Yeah, make it count.

586
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:15,239
- You ready?
- Okay.

587
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,878
- T is for tears.
- Okay.

588
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:25,418
You make me so happy. I can't
remember the last time I cried.

589
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:27,452
Oh.

590
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:29,556
- It's good. It's good.
- Good. Good.

591
00:36:34,894 --> 00:36:36,361
<b></b> Tears.

592
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:39,866
I miss my tears. I do...

593
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,270
Maybe we should take a day
off the vampire routine.

594
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:49,441
You look like shit.

595
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:51,577
What? Thank you.

596
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,346
I'm fine.

597
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,681
What do the lab results say?

598
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,850
We still don't know why
your blood is resistant.

599
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:01,651
But the antibody drug conjugate

600
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,920
is definitely lowering
Janet's viral load.

601
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,455
Okay.

602
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:08,026
It's slowing down the infection,
even easing the rage.

603
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:09,995
Okay, good.

604
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:13,531
But, uh, only temporarily. Look.

605
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:23,606
That rat was treated with our
latest vaccine from your blood.

606
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:26,043
It was only five minutes in.

607
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,744
Well, the guy's
behind you, still.

608
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,480
Well, he looks like an
asshole, for a rat.

609
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,855
What I'm trying to tell you is,

610
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,489
basically, we're still
far off the vaccine.

611
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:44,394
A vaccine will prevent
further infection, but...

612
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,890
Morgan, you gotta start
listening to me when I tell you

613
00:37:47,914 --> 00:37:50,116
that there's no guarantee
that I can bring Janet back.

614
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,467
Don't. Not this.

615
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:54,502
- You're not listening to me.
- Please, don't.

616
00:37:54,504 --> 00:37:57,374
I don't need it, okay. Not today.
Give me a break.

617
00:37:59,509 --> 00:38:00,610
Okay?

618
00:38:06,983 --> 00:38:09,751
- I feel how you touch me.
- Gina...

619
00:38:09,753 --> 00:38:11,588
I can see how you look at me.

620
00:38:15,324 --> 00:38:17,992
I love you, Morgan.

621
00:38:17,994 --> 00:38:20,831
I love that you still love her.
I do.

622
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:23,797
But it's time for you to let go.

623
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:26,700
Whoa, whoa. Don't tell me what
it's time for me to do, okay?

624
00:38:26,702 --> 00:38:28,769
That is not your place.
Just back the fuck up

625
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:31,073
for one minute here.
God damn it.

626
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:36,745
Oh, yeah, and by the way,
she's not dead. Okay?

627
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:42,484
No, she's worse.

628

630
00:39:21,488 --> 00:39:24,656
The record store was meant
to be our adventure.

631
00:39:24,658 --> 00:39:27,459
- Hey. Shh. It's okay.
- It's not okay.

632
00:39:27,461 --> 00:39:30,141
What, we gotta sell our wedding rings
to keep the goddamn lights on?

633
00:39:30,165 --> 00:39:31,300
I mean, come on.

634
00:39:38,872 --> 00:39:40,872
- Maybe I should go back to teaching.
<b></font></b>- No!

635
00:39:40,874 --> 00:39:45,178
You hated teaching. The shop
is your dream. Our dream.

00:39:45,412 --> 00:39:48,079
You know, and I won't give it up

He was one of mine.

Wait, wait, wait. Take it easy.
Don't kill him.

Take it easy, Knox. Okay?

Hey.

662

Hello.

663
00:45:06,256 --> 00:45:08,223
The music's not
affecting him at all.

664
00:45:08,225 --> 00:45:09,493
Nothing.

665
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,262
Not a bit.

666
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:24,107
- He's smoking.
- He's smoking.

667
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:39,489
He had a University of
Minneapolis campus ID on him.

668
00:45:39,723 --> 00:45:43,023
Professor Michael Jansen.

669
00:45:43,025 --> 00:45:44,860
- What kind of professor?
- Doesn't say.

670
00:45:58,741 --> 00:46:01,143
- Um... Be careful.
- I will.

671
00:46:02,311 --> 00:46:04,012
You know, I love this song.

672
00:46:13,422 --> 00:46:15,221
You wanted to speak with me?

673
00:46:15,223 --> 00:46:17,923
I wanted to see if the
rumors were true.

674
00:46:17,925 --> 00:46:19,992
The rumors. Oh, well.

675
00:46:19,994 --> 00:46:23,531
I didn't realize I was so popular.
How do you know about me?

676
00:46:23,766 --> 00:46:27,568
Well, you know us Infected.
We just love to gossip.

677
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,535
So you were a professor?

678
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,270
By passion and trade.

679
00:46:31,272 --> 00:46:33,239
Do you remember anything
about your human life?

680
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:34,340
Do you remember teaching?

681
00:46:34,342 --> 00:46:37,008
Of course. Don't you?

682
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,110
Well, I mean, how do
you know I was a...

683
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:41,382
Mmm. Like I said, word travels.
What subject?

684
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:47,520
- Biology. I gave it up.
- Yes.

685
00:46:47,522 --> 00:46:51,122
I would have to if I had to teach a
bunch of high school Neanderthals.

686
00:46:51,124 --> 00:46:53,260
Hey, don't hate on the kids.</font></b>

687
00:46:54,361 --> 00:46:57,862
No, no, no. Thank you. I quit.

688
00:46:57,864 --> 00:47:01,066
Good for you. I, however,
am a lifetime smoker.

689
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,270
Oh! That'll get you
in the end, you know.

690
00:47:05,105 --> 00:47:07,307
Okay, so when were you infected?

691
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,379
Oh, here we go. When
were you infected?

692
00:47:13,913 --> 00:47:15,582
When were you infected?

693
00:47:19,085 --> 00:47:23,053
When were you infected? No?
You don't wanna play?

694
00:47:23,055 --> 00:47:25,816
This is how you wanna play? You wanna
play nice? You wanna play rough?

695
00:47:26,325 --> 00:47:28,125
No, look, I got all
day, all night.

696
00:47:28,127 --> 00:47:30,361
Funnily enough, I got nowhere
that I need to be tonight,

697
00:47:30,363 --> 00:47:32,129
so it's only a matter of time.

698
00:47:32,131 --> 00:47:36,202
Trust me, young man, time's a
luxury that you cannot afford.

699
00:47:42,107 --> 00:47:44,941
- So, the music doesn't bother you?
- No.

700
00:47:44,943 --> 00:47:46,310
Is it supposed to?

701
00:47:46,312 --> 00:47:48,144
Well, it has with every
other Infected, yeah.

702
00:47:48,146 --> 00:47:52,081
So because of the behavior of a
few, you assume we're all the same?

703
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:53,983
Just an observation.
Broad observation.

704
00:47:53,985 --> 00:47:56,419
It doesn't take
individuality into account.

705
00:47:56,421 --> 00:47:58,554
Oh, excuse me. So each
Infected is different?

706
00:47:58,556 --> 00:48:00,323
Yes, well, why wouldn't we be?

707
00:48:00,325 --> 00:48:02,592
Each uninfected is different.

708
00:48:02,594 --> 00:48:05,395
Look at you. You were bitten.

709
00:48:05,397 --> 00:48:07,230
The virus altered
you enough so that

710
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:09,399
you could communicate
with us and yet,

711
00:48:09,401 --> 00:48:11,669
you're still not
really one of us.

712
00:48:13,171 --> 00:48:14,439
Are you?

713
00:48:15,507 --> 00:48:17,442
No, I'm not one of you.

714
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:22,445
Anyway, back to business.

715
00:48:22,447 --> 00:48:24,246
You wanna tell me
about Patient Zero?

716
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:25,650
Why would I answer
your questions?

717
00:48:25,884 --> 00:48:28,150
And even if I did, why would
I answer them honestly?

718
00:48:28,152 --> 00:48:31,119
Because I'm asking so nicely,
and I know that you can't lie.

719
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:34,055
- Oh, is that so?
- I believe it to be so.

720
00:48:34,057 --> 00:48:36,297
I mean, at least that is my
understanding of your nature.

721
00:48:36,321 --> 00:48:38,456
Oh, that is your
understanding of my nature?

722
00:48:39,463 --> 00:48:40,996
That's quite precious.

723
00:48:40,998 --> 00:48:42,997
Believe me, I've seen a
lot of you come and go.

724
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:45,200
A lot, but not all.

725
00:48:45,202 --> 00:48:47,169
Well, so you're the anomaly.

726
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:50,272
Well, I do like to think
of myself as special.

727
00:48:54,343 --> 00:48:56,145
Don't you believe in exceptions?

728
00:48:57,213 --> 00:49:00,114
I do believe in exceptions.

729
00:49:00,116 --> 00:49:01,951
- Go ahead. Please explain.
- I...

730
00:49:05,655 --> 00:49:07,490
This should be quite good.

731
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:11,625
Free will, Professor.

732
00:49:11,627 --> 00:49:14,328
I believe you lost that
capacity when you were turned.

733
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:16,397
Oh, I see.

734
00:49:16,399 --> 00:49:20,099
So, you're postulating that because I'm no
longer human, that I don't have free will.

735
00:49:20,101 --> 00:49:23,471
And yet, here I am conversing
with you, enjoying a smoke.

736
00:49:23,473 --> 00:49:25,641
These are hardly the traits
one would associate with

737
00:49:26,709 --> 00:49:28,642
an animal.

738
00:49:28,644 --> 00:49:33,112
In fact, I would argue that we're
a more evolved species than you.

739
00:49:33,114 --> 00:49:36,182
An evolved species that destroys
without any conscience.

740
00:49:36,184 --> 00:49:39,619
Yes, just like humans, who destroy
chickens and cows without a conscience.

741
00:49:39,621 --> 00:49:42,155
No, no, come on, man, that's
food, that's sustenance.

742
00:49:42,157 --> 00:49:44,459
What do you think
violence is for us?

743
00:49:50,499 --> 00:49:52,567
You wanna tell me how
you became infected?

744
00:50:03,511 --> 00:50:06,646
I was teaching a class
the day it happened.

745
00:50:06,648 --> 00:50:09,481
I had just started a lecture
on medieval philosophy.

746
00:50:09,483 --> 00:50:14,553
St. Augustine says that man must
love because he is incomplete.

747
00:50:14,555 --> 00:50:17,222
Loving is an act of good.

748
00:50:17,224 --> 00:50:22,160
A unique human ability, granted
as a gift from a higher power.

749
00:50:22,162 --> 00:50:26,032
In St. Augustine's
<i>Doctrine of Love,</i>

750
00:50:29,202 --> 00:50:32,372
he states that... Um...</font></b>

751
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:40,712
"To not love is
to be incomplete,

752
00:50:40,714 --> 00:50:46,486
"to not love is to not
be human." Excuse me.

753
00:50:49,122 --> 00:50:51,656
Hello. Hello.

754
00:50:51,658 --> 00:50:54,392
Yeah. Hi, honey, look, I can't
talk right now, all right?

755
00:50:54,394 --> 00:50:56,126
- I'm busy...
<b></font></b>- <i>People are being attacked.</i>

756
00:50:56,128 --> 00:50:57,628
- What?
- <i>You gotta come home.</i>

757
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:00,464
- <i>I'm really scared.</i>
- Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.

758
00:51:00,466 --> 00:51:02,700
- <i>I hear screams.</i>
- What's happening?

759
00:51:04,504 --> 00:51:07,024
Wait, honey, look, I'll call you back.
I'll call you right back.

760
00:51:18,517 --> 00:51:21,384
Help me. Help me, please.</font></b>

761
00:51:21,386 --> 00:51:23,553

763
00:51:50,247 --> 00:51:52,149
<b></font></b><i>What happened to your family?</i>

764
00:51:53,417 --> 00:51:56,120
<b></font></b>- <i>What?</i>
<b></font></b>- <i>Your family?</i>

765
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:03,859
- My family?
<b></font></b>- Yeah.

00:52:03,861 --> 00:52:05,396
You know what happened to them?

767
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,334
When the virus takes
over your body,

768
00:52:13,169 --> 00:52:14,905
it's like...

769
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,875
Every nerve has
been stretched...

770
00:52:19,877 --> 00:52:21,511
<i>Help!</i> <b></b>

and doused in vinegar.

773
00:52:31,788 --> 00:52:34,789
But even in the
throes of this pain,

774
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:37,327
I was driven by one
compelling thought.

775
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:43,265
I needed to see my family.

00:53:40,288 --> 00:53:42,588
<i>She begged me to stop.</i>

00:54:04,644 --> 00:54:07,948
I wanted to tell her that I
was no longer her daddy.

793
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,355
You're a goddamn animal.

794
00:54:19,425 --> 00:54:21,025
Between the humans
and The Infected,

795
00:54:21,027 --> 00:54:23,762
who do you think is on the top
of the evolutionary scale?

796
00:54:23,764 --> 00:54:26,332
- Not you.
- See, I beg to differ.

797
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:30,601
Our brains have been
enhanced by the virus.

798
00:54:30,603 --> 00:54:35,508
Therefore freeing us from the
limitations of what you call human.

799
00:54:53,893 --> 00:54:56,894
- Where is Patient Zero?
- Oh, there is none.

800
00:54:56,896 --> 00:54:58,831
The virus started
somewhere, where is he?

801
00:55:00,266 --> 00:55:01,430
The rage.

802
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:06,435
The rage started here
against the government.

803
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:10,673
The rich, the poor, foreigners,
intellectuals, conservatives,

804
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:13,545
feminists, freaks, name it.

805
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:16,412
- That's where it came from.
- Shut up.

806
00:55:16,414 --> 00:55:20,883
We became so angry for so many
good reasons, and for none.

807
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:23,953
The virus has laid dormant in
us since the beginning of time.

808
00:55:23,955 --> 00:55:26,055
- Shut up.
- And the extremes of modern stress

809
00:55:26,057 --> 00:55:27,757
- have caused it to awaken.
- Shut up.

810
00:55:27,759 --> 00:55:30,592
- We're all, in essence, Patient Zero.
- Shut up. Shut up.

811
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:32,931
Shut up, goddamn it!

812
00:55:34,032 --> 00:55:35,865
See?

813
00:55:35,867 --> 00:55:37,701
We're not that
different, are we?

814
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:54,015

- Sorry, he's debating with me.

- No, you shouldn't have hit him.

- He's being an asshole.
- Don't hit him again.

820
00:56:07,725 --> 00:56:09,663
- I won't.
- Don't let him get to you.

821
00:56:09,665 --> 00:56:10,968
Go in there and take control.

822
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:18,441

Is that a question?

826
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,824
It's nice to be in
love though, isn't it?

827
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,524
What, you gonna lecture
me about love now?

828
00:56:38,526 --> 00:56:39,646
What do you know about love?

829
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:42,096
Just because I killed my family,

830
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:43,598
doesn't mean I didn't love them.

831
00:56:51,806 --> 00:56:53,174
Thanks.

832
00:56:56,878 --> 00:56:58,146
How's your wife?

833
00:56:59,814 --> 00:57:00,880
Fine.

834
00:57:00,882 --> 00:57:01,983
Is she?

835
00:57:04,653 --> 00:57:06,587
No, she's not. Thank
you for asking.

836
00:57:09,724 --> 00:57:12,493
I don't know if my wife's
a human being anymore.

837
00:57:13,995 --> 00:57:15,696
That's how she is.

838
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,799
I remember why I quit.

839
00:57:24,772 --> 00:57:27,606
So that's why you're so interested
in finding Patient Zero.

840
00:57:27,608 --> 00:57:29,074
No, it's because
you're a disease.

841
00:57:29,076 --> 00:57:31,109
A disease that I
believe can be cured.

842
00:57:31,111 --> 00:57:33,679
- Do I look sick to you?
- Yes.

843
00:57:33,681 --> 00:57:37,217
<b></b> I don't think that
we're the disease.

844
00:57:37,483 --> 00:57:42,120
I think that human beings are the
disease, and we're the cure.

845
00:57:42,122 --> 00:57:44,959
The antidote that has
been given to Earth

846
00:57:46,793 --> 00:57:48,761
to get rid of the
human infection.

847
00:57:52,632 --> 00:57:54,072
How are those headaches
treating you?

848
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:56,934
Oh, fine and dandy, thank you.

849
00:57:56,936 --> 00:57:59,172
I know more about you than
you know about yourself.

850
00:58:02,709 --> 00:58:08,511
Those headaches, that's the rage
inside you, yearning to escape.

851
00:58:08,513 --> 00:58:10,883
Thank you for the
educational talk.

852
00:58:12,651 --> 00:58:15,186
But we are at war here.

853
00:58:15,188 --> 00:58:20,259
If we're at war, I suggest you
ask yourself who's winning.

854
00:58:20,492 --> 00:58:22,492
Oh, you think you're winning?
Hey, let me tell you.

855
00:58:22,516 --> 00:58:25,895
However slight the human race may
be, we will continue to fight.

856
00:58:25,897 --> 00:58:27,897
We will continue
to remain curious.

857
00:58:27,899 --> 00:58:31,067
We will continue to find solutions
and we will continue to adapt

858
00:58:31,069 --> 00:58:32,669
because that is what we do,

859
00:58:32,671 --> 00:58:35,005
and that is what we have done
since the dawn of time, okay?

860
00:58:35,007 --> 00:58:37,807
What, you see me rub my head,
you see me pop some pills,

861
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:40,610
and from that you figure out
I got chronic headaches?

862
00:58:40,612 --> 00:58:44,981
Geez, Columbo, like you
noticed the tan line

863
00:58:44,983 --> 00:58:47,117
around my ring finger
and from that you

864
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,252
figure out that I was
married, so what?

865
00:58:49,254 --> 00:58:51,154
<b><font face="Rockwell" color="#D900D9">You've been playing me.

866
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:52,956
You've been playing
tricks on me.

867
00:58:52,958 --> 00:58:55,557
Playing tricks like the way you
Trojan horsed yourself in here.

868
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:58,128
You know, you claim that
you wanted to talk to me,

869
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,561
and that's what
we've been doing,

870
00:58:59,563 --> 00:59:01,597
we've been talking, and talking,

871
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,200
and talking. We've been going around,
and around, and around in circles

872
00:59:05,202 --> 00:59:07,569
not talking about
anything specific.

873
00:59:07,571 --> 00:59:09,774
No, no, no. It's just
random bullshit.

874
00:59:11,675 --> 00:59:13,543
You're wasting my goddamn time.

875
00:59:16,881 --> 00:59:19,081
Time.

876
00:59:19,083 --> 00:59:21,252
Time which you claim
that I don't have.

877
00:59:30,094 --> 00:59:33,164
Gina, can you bring me your
frequency detector, like, now?

878
00:59:41,037 --> 00:59:42,739
What's going on?

879
00:59:43,973 --> 00:59:46,042
You think he's
transmitting a signal?

880
00:59:48,912 --> 00:59:50,612
I don't know.

881
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,188
Morgan?

882
01:00:05,328 --> 01:00:06,329
Hey!

883
01:00:15,871 --> 01:00:17,574
You knew about me, didn't you?

884
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,741
Just like the professor.

885
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,776
This whole goddamn
thing was a setup.

886
01:00:22,778 --> 01:00:25,848
Jesus Christ. You wanted it,
you wanted to be captured.

887
01:00:27,715 --> 01:00:30,885
Yeah, I know, and now I'm gonna
make you talk, motherfucker.

888
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,988
Security, open 23.

889
01:00:38,793 --> 01:00:43,365

893
01:00:56,643 --> 01:00:59,345
Knife. Knife. I need a knife.

895
01:01:29,342 --> 01:01:31,342
<b></font></b> It was definitely
sending out a signal.

896
01:01:31,344 --> 01:01:34,345
But who the hell put the tracking
device in this Pete Townshend?

897
01:01:34,347 --> 01:01:37,981
I don't know, sir. A smart, a
strategically advanced Infected.

898
01:01:37,983 --> 01:01:41,419
He said it. The guy I was interviewing.
Professor Asshole.

899
01:01:41,421 --> 01:01:43,120
You know, they know about me.

900
01:01:43,122 --> 01:01:44,222
They know what we're
trying to do here.

901
01:01:44,224 --> 01:01:45,856
They know that we're
trying to stop them.

902
01:01:45,858 --> 01:01:47,358
But they don't
know where we are.

903
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,294
So, they planted a tracking
device in Pete Townshend

904
01:01:50,296 --> 01:01:52,162
and The Infected are
now tracking us.

905
01:01:52,164 --> 01:01:53,931
- They know we're here.
- Jesus.

906
01:01:55,434 --> 01:01:57,401
Knox.

907
01:01:57,403 --> 01:01:59,136
Well, where are they now?

908
01:01:59,138 --> 01:02:01,258
- New body bags coming in from the field.
- Body bags?

909
01:02:01,282 --> 01:02:03,417
Make sure no one gets in
or out of this facility.

910
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,895

You really have no idea, do you?

We're all gonna fucking
die down here.

It was him or us.

I am, I'm sorry, Andrew.
You're right.

Put the gun down, you

I have to get my research.

01:15:08,769 --> 01:15:09,870
No!

1018
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:13,207
Hold on, I'm coming!

1019
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:14,842
Take my hand. <b></b>

1020
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:20,514
I got you, I got you. <b></b>

1021
01:15:21,649 --> 01:15:22,717
<b></font></b> Let's go.

1022
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:26,988
Let's go.

1023
01:15:33,827 --> 01:15:37,129
Sorry, Morgan. I
can't let you leave.

1024
01:15:37,131 --> 01:15:40,232
Your blood has something in it that
stops you from fully transforming.

1025
01:15:40,234 --> 01:15:42,033
<b></font></b> Morgan.

1026
01:15:42,035 --> 01:15:44,675
- From reaching complete enlightenment.
- Morgan, what's he saying?

1027
01:15:46,506 --> 01:15:47,874
- Shit.
- What?

1028
01:15:52,078 --> 01:15:54,245
- They're here for me.
<b></font></b>- What?

1029
01:15:54,247 --> 01:15:56,681
- Ironic, isn't it?
- Morgan, we need to get out of here.

1030
01:15:56,683 --> 01:15:58,850
You're our Patient Zero.

1031
01:15:58,852 --> 01:16:01,254
Which means that you're a
threat to our continued growth.

1032
01:16:01,921 --> 01:16:03,687
To our future.

1033
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:05,856
<b></font></b> We need to leave, now.

1034
01:16:05,858 --> 01:16:09,295
And that I cannot allow.

1035
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:12,063
<b></font></b> Run!

1036
01:17:04,082 --> 01:17:06,250
Your blood makes
you weak, Morgan.

1037
01:17:08,119 --> 01:17:09,786
You're afraid of pain.

1038
01:17:10,787 --> 01:17:12,356
You're afraid to go to extremes.

1039
01:17:12,589 --> 01:17:13,924
Embrace enlightenment.

1040
01:17:53,662 --> 01:17:54,797
Quickly.

1041
01:18:02,606 --> 01:18:03,606
Go!

1042
01:18:05,341 --> 01:18:07,174
Go!

1043
01:18:07,176 --> 01:18:09,042
- I can slow them down.
- Don't do this.

1044
01:18:09,044 --> 01:18:11,347
- Okay? You're coming with me.
- No. No.

1045
01:18:12,647 --> 01:18:14,214
Hurry, they're gonna
break through.

1046
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:17,317
- Save the baby.
- What?

1047
01:18:17,319 --> 01:18:19,754
Don't you sense it?
She's pregnant.

1048
01:18:20,289 --> 01:18:22,389
You're pregnant?

1049
01:18:22,391 --> 01:18:23,858
- I love you.
- Janet, no.

1050
01:18:25,059 --> 01:18:26,362
Janet, please.

1051
01:18:27,662 --> 01:18:28,663
Janet.

1052
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:35,268
No! No! Janet. Please. Please.

1053
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:37,270
- I love you.
- Janet!

1054
01:18:37,272 --> 01:18:40,072
Hey, Janet, please. Don't, don't.
Janet!

1055
01:18:40,074 --> 01:18:44,709
No, please don't do this.
No, no, no. Janet.

1056
01:18:44,711 --> 01:18:47,081
Janet! Janet!

1057
01:18:48,016 --> 01:18:49,915
I'm sorry.

1058
01:18:49,917 --> 01:18:51,917
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1059
01:18:51,919 --> 01:18:53,188
We gotta go.

1060
01:18:54,422 --> 01:18:56,123
Oh, fuck.

1061
01:18:57,925 --> 01:18:59,092
We gotta move.

1062
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:01,094
Okay?

1063
01:19:03,297 --> 01:19:05,030
We gotta go.

1064
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:06,099
Morgan, we gotta go.

1065
01:19:30,823 --> 01:19:32,091

1066
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:34,260
Come on.

1067
01:19:51,776 --> 01:19:53,410
So I can see it,

1068
01:19:53,412 --> 01:19:55,081
where my bike is stashed.

1069
01:19:57,916 --> 01:19:59,151
Let's go this way.

1070
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:14,132

1071
01:20:26,111 --> 01:20:27,279
Oh, God.

1072
01:20:28,946 --> 01:20:30,914
We're never gonna
make it this time.

1073
01:20:31,982 --> 01:20:35,117
Got you. Hey, listen to me.

1074
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:38,421
Don't talk like that, okay?
We are gonna make it.

1075
01:20:38,423 --> 01:20:41,290
Me, you, and that baby.
We are gonna be fine.

1076
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:43,827
We're gonna find somewhere
better, but you gotta trust me.

1077
01:20:45,262 --> 01:20:46,895
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1078
01:20:46,897 --> 01:20:48,065
Okay.
