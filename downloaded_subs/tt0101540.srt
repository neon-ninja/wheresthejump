for such a lovely river,

the name was mystifying,
Cape Fear.

When the only thing
to fear on those
enchanted summer nights

5
00:03:56,343 --> 00:03:58,010
was that the magic
would end

00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:00,429

come crashing in.

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,400
Oh, the houseboat.

175
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:27,408
LEIGH: It's not even
July 3rd yet.

176
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:28,493
Yeah.

177
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:29,869
Yeah. I was thinking
we ought to take

178
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:31,204
two weeks off and
go up to Wilmington

179
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:32,788
like the old times,
dock the houseboat.

180
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:34,541
I wanted to
in early June.

181
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:36,251
Remember you said
you didn't have time
this summer.

182
00:13:36,336 --> 00:13:37,377
I probably don't.

183
00:13:37,462 --> 00:13:38,879
Yeah, well,
now I don't, either.

184
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:41,424
Besides,
Dani's got summer school
till Labor Day.

185
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:42,926
Is it really
that critical

186
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,386
that she can't
miss two damn weeks?

187
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:48,015
(SIGHS) Well, you know,
the alternative was
to expel her.

188
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,851
Besides,
maybe this Drama teacher
from the college

189
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:52,811
will get her excited
about something,
you know?

190
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:54,940
Yeah, about him,
probably.

191
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:57,108
I mean, why'd they have
to make such a stink,

192
00:13:57,193 --> 00:13:59,361
like she was on heroin,
or something?

193
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:01,613
I mean, marijuana,
what's marijuana?

194
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:03,658
You and I smoked
a little dope
in our time.

195
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:04,825
Yeah.

196
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,160
You know,
in some cultures,

197
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,870
it's considered
almost a sacrament.

198
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:09,957
Of course,
I realize in ours,
it's forbidden.

199
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:15,212
Right up there with incest
and necrophilia
and bestiality.

200
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:16,714
Honey. Honey. Honey.

201
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,841
Worship of idols,
cannibalism.

202
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,009
Do that again.

203
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:21,803
What?

204
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:23,304
Do that again.

205
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,932
(LAUGHS)

206

(FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING)

207
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,643
Sam. Sam,
somebody's out there!
What?

208
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,939
No, leave the light off.
Leave it off.

209
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:26,361
I saw him when
the fireworks went off.

210

(MURMURING)

211
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:28,739
What?

212
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,991
I think I talked
to him this afternoon.
You know him?

213
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:35,288
I want you the hell
off my property!

214
00:16:48,303 --> 00:16:49,638
He's gone.

215
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:58,940
He said, "I'm gonna
make you think
about loss."

216
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:02,444
Or, "I'm gonna make
you learn about loss."
Something like that.

217
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:04,447
That's very poetic.

218
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:06,741
So, who is he?
Where did he come from?

219
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:07,992
Well, he's from...

220
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:11,413
Come on, Leigh,
get the dog off.
Ben, get down.

221
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:12,789
(LAUGHS)

222
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:14,666
He doesn't
mind me at all.

223
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,251
Leigh, he's your dog.
Come on.

224
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:18,796
No, he shouldn't
be up on the table.

225
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:21,299
You're gonna have
dog hairs in the tea
and everything.

226
00:17:21,383 --> 00:17:23,134
Get down.
So where's he from?

227
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:26,013
Oh, he's from the hills,
Pentecostal crackers,
you know.

228
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:29,183
What was he
in prison for?

229
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:32,604
I think it was battery.

230
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:34,147
You think
it was battery?
Yeah.

231
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:35,607
I mean, well,
who did he batter?

232
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:37,942
Did he batter a man?
Did he batter a woman?
What?

233
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:39,111
I don't know.

234
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:42,364
It was 14 years ago.
You know, it's kind of...

235
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:45,034
I really don't remember.

236
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,205
What does he want
with you?

237
00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:51,792
He's just trying
to bug us,
just messing around.

238
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:54,212
You know,
he's an ex-con,
so he's just...

239
00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:58,716
You know,
he's probably upset
at the lawyer.

240
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:00,803
Yeah, your clientele.

241
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:02,012
Yeah.

242
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:06,975
Bye, Dad.
Bye, Dani.

243
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,102
You look tired.

244
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,313
Thanks.
I needed that. Leigh.

245
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:12,190
Leigh,
I don't want
to alarm her,

246
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:14,317
but I'd rather Dani
didn't wander out alone

247
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:16,278
on her soul-searching
walks in the woods

248
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,822
at least till I've
started a few things,

249
00:18:17,906 --> 00:18:19,323
maybe even talked
to the boss.

250
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:20,991
What if she takes
Benjamin with her?

251
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:22,619
What? Big Ben,
our guard dog?

252
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:24,579
What's he gonna do,
lick him to death?

253
00:18:24,664 --> 00:18:26,206
Just tell her.
LEIGH: Tell her what?

254
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,041
I hardly know anything
about the man.

255
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,626
I don't mean
his biography.

256
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:31,045
Just there's
some creep around.

257
00:18:31,129 --> 00:18:33,631
And if you see him again,
call the cops
and then call me.

258
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,967
What about a weapon,
you know?

259
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:39,012
In case things get
exciting around here.

260
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:41,098
Look, Leigh,
would you really
feel more secure

261
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:42,558
with a loaded gun
in the house?

262
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:44,978
We'd probably end up
using it on each other.

263
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:46,521
Or Dani would.

264
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:48,815
He's not gonna do anything.
He just got out of prison.

265
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:51,192
He doesn't want
to go right back.
All right?

266
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:55,447
Call Lee Heller.

267
00:18:56,032 --> 00:18:57,533
Lee is
a colorful character,

268
00:18:57,617 --> 00:18:59,536
but he's still the best
criminal lawyer
in the state.

269
00:18:59,954 --> 00:19:01,788
Good.
Bonnie,
get me Lee Heller.

270
00:19:02,456 --> 00:19:04,875
Sam, you defended
this guy, right?

271
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:05,918
Right.

272
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:07,879
So, what makes you think
he wants to harm you?

273
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:09,922
Yesterday I was
getting in my car.

274
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:12,758
The guy comes up,
we have a little
conversation.

275
00:19:12,843 --> 00:19:16,096
He says to me,
"You're gonna
learn about loss."

276
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,309
That'd hardly qualify
under the terrorist
threat statutes.

277
00:19:20,644 --> 00:19:23,438
Oh, come on, Tom,
for Christ's sake,
the guy's an ex-con.

278
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:26,524
You know
as well as I do
what that means.

279
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:29,320
I mean, last night,
there he was,
he was behind our house.

280
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:31,071
Ah. Attempted B and E.

281
00:19:31,156 --> 00:19:32,406
No, not exactly.

282
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,119
I mean,
he was sitting on a wall
that bounds our property.

283
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:38,914
(LAUGHS) That's not
even trespassing, Sam.

284
00:19:38,998 --> 00:19:40,624
I mean, come on.
What can I say?

285
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,293
I mean,
get a restraining order.

286
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:45,713
I did.
I filed one this morning.
The hearing's in 10 days.

287
00:19:45,797 --> 00:19:49,175
Good. Good.
I mean, you know,
anything I can do.

288
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,345
Tom, 14 years ago

289
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:56,183
in this case
I had a report
on the victim.

290
00:19:56,518 --> 00:19:58,353
It was a rape case.
That's right.

291
00:19:58,437 --> 00:20:00,772
Rape and
aggravated sexual battery.

292
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:02,607
Anyway,
I had a report
on this victim

293
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:05,694
and it came back that
she was promiscuous.

294
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:08,822
And...

295
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,451
I buried it.

296
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,120
Whew.

297
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:17,207
Anybody else know
about this?

298
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,459
No, no, no,
I buried it.

299
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:19,669
I mean,
I didn't show it
to the client,

300
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:21,963
I didn't show it
to the prosecution.

301
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:24,924
But if you had seen
what this guy had
done to this girl...

302
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,178
"In every
criminal prosecution,
the accused shall have

303

"the Assistance of
Counsel for his defense."

00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:31,390
I know
the Sixth Amendment.

305
00:20:31,474 --> 00:20:32,809
I believe in
the Sixth Amendment.

306
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:35,436
I mean, that's why I left
the Public Defender's Office.

307
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:38,314
There was no way
to serve the law
in that capacity.

308
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:39,399
Some folks just
don't have the right

309
00:20:39,483 --> 00:20:40,567
to the best defense,
huh, Sam?

310
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:42,820
No! Of course
they deserve
the best defense!

311
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:45,614
But, I mean,
if you had seen what
he did to this girl...

312
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:46,907
You buried the report.

313
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:48,410
I mean, if it was
your own daughter, Tom.

314
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:51,496
Yeah, I mean...
Buried the report.

315
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:53,331
Jesus, Sam.

316
00:20:55,002 --> 00:20:56,377
Oh, God.

(SIGHS)

318
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:03,301
But I don't see how
he could know that.

319
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:04,553
I mean,
he was illiterate.

320
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:06,805
I mean, I had to
read everything to him,

the probable
cause affidavit,

322
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:10,685
the arrest reports,
everything.

323
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,856
There's no way
he could know that.

324
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:30,206
Hey, Dani,
it's so quiet out here,
and the light's so perfect,

325
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,461
why don't you get your book
and come out here and read?

326
00:21:33,545 --> 00:21:34,628
Why?

327
00:21:35,714 --> 00:21:37,131
I told you why.

328
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:41,470
Well, is it because
he's like a flasher
or just a peeper?

329
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:44,347
What do you know
about that?
A flasher?

330
00:21:44,432 --> 00:21:47,185
Oh, you don't think
I've been flashed
before?

331
00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:49,562
Oh, well,
I certainly didn't mean
to insult you.

332
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:51,397
I'm sure you've
been flashed before.

333
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:54,276
Look, if you want to
come out, come on out.
If you don't, go on.

334
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:56,403
Do whatever you want.

335

go outside.

00:22:28,273 --> 00:22:30,984
My own daughter,
she don't even know me.

343
00:22:31,402 --> 00:22:34,279
After I went inside,
her mama told her
I was dead,

344
00:22:34,364 --> 00:22:36,282
which, in a way,
I was.

345
00:22:36,784 --> 00:22:40,703
Look, Mr. Cady,
I realize that
you suffered.

346
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:41,913
(LAUGHS)

347
00:22:41,997 --> 00:22:44,917
I mean,
I understand your problem,
but, I mean, why me?

348
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,379
I was your lawyer.
I defended you.

349
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:51,967
I mean,
why not badger the D.A.
Or the judge?

350
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:53,135
(LAUGHING) "Badger."

351
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:54,261
Yeah. Why not them?

352
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:57,180
Yeah. Why not them?
"Badger."

353
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:01,269
Best I remember,
they was just doing
right by their jobs.

354
00:23:01,353 --> 00:23:03,855
Oh, I didn't do my job?
Is that right?

355
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:07,651
Look, I pleaded you out to
a lesser occluded offense.

356
00:23:07,735 --> 00:23:09,987
You could've gotten rape
instead of battery.

357
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:12,323
Oh, I'd have been up
for parole either way
in seven years

358
00:23:12,408 --> 00:23:13,616
according to the
Georgia penal code.

359
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:14,701
Rape is
a capital offense.

360
00:23:14,785 --> 00:23:17,328
I mean,
you could've gotten life,
you could've done death.

361
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:20,291
You could be sitting
on death row right now.

362
00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:24,628
I learned to read
during my stretch.

363
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:28,842
First,
Spot Goes to the Farm,

364
00:23:28,926 --> 00:23:32,220
then Runaway Bunny,
then law books, mostly.

365
00:23:34,266 --> 00:23:36,350
Did you know that
after I discharged you,

366
00:23:36,435 --> 00:23:38,269
I acted as
my own attorney?

367
00:23:38,854 --> 00:23:40,856
Applied several times
for an appeal.

368
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,816
No, I didn't know that.

369
00:23:44,277 --> 00:23:45,527
Mmm-hmm.

370
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:47,696
So, here we are,

371
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,284
two lawyers,
for all practical purposes,
talking shop.

372
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:54,204
All right. How much
do you want, Mr. Cady?

373
00:23:55,457 --> 00:23:57,041
How much
do I want what?

374
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,251
How much money
do you want?

375
00:23:59,586 --> 00:24:03,173
Money? Counselor,
do I look destitute
to you?

376
00:24:03,257 --> 00:24:06,426
Well,
I'm open to discussion,
within reasonable limits.

377
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:10,348
You ever been a woman?

378
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:11,807
A what?

379
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:12,934
A woman.

380
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:17,898
Some fat, hairy,
ugly hillbilly's
wet dream?

381
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:23,362
Look, I realize that
you suffered in prison.

382
00:24:23,446 --> 00:24:24,447
Suffered.

383
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:25,865
There's no question
about that.
"Suffered."

384
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,826
You don't know
what suffering is,
Counselor.

385
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:31,747
Like it says
in Galatians 3,

386
00:24:31,831 --> 00:24:34,667
"Have ye suffered
so many things in vain?"

387
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:37,044
Yeah.

388
00:24:37,128 --> 00:24:39,089
I learned from
the get-go in the joint
to get in touch

389
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:42,842
with the soft
nurturing side of myself,
the feminine side.

390
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:52,561
Well, I'm open to
some sort of discussion
on compensation.

391
00:24:53,773 --> 00:24:56,233
What shall be
my compensation, sir,

392
00:24:56,317 --> 00:24:59,528
for being held down
and sodomized
by four white guys

393
00:24:59,612 --> 00:25:01,572
or four black guys?

394
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:05,076
Shall my compensation
be the same?

395
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,205
What is the formula
for compensation, sir?

396
00:25:08,581 --> 00:25:10,874
How about $10,000
in cash?

397
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:15,088
Do I...

398
00:25:19,176 --> 00:25:20,802
Well, let's just
break that down.
No.

399
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:22,972
Now, wait, wait,
wait a minute.
Let's just break it down.

400
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:24,432
You see,
that figure just came
to the top of my head.

401
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:26,100
Well, let's just say,
for argument's sake,

402
00:25:26,184 --> 00:25:29,312
let's say $20,000,
let's say $30,000.

403
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:31,523
Say...
I'll tell you what.
Let's say $50,000.

404
00:25:32,692 --> 00:25:34,985
$50,000 into 14 years.

405
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:38,823
Fourteen years times
365 days is about...

406
00:25:39,366 --> 00:25:41,117
I say about 5,000 days.

407
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:45,581
Now,
you divide that by $50,000,
and that's like $10 a day.

408
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,792
(LAUGHING) That's
not even minimum wage.

409
00:25:48,877 --> 00:25:52,756
To say nothing about
the family that I lost,
the respect that I lost.

410
00:25:53,215 --> 00:25:55,175
I don't think you really,
really understand

411
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:57,344
what we're
talking about here.

412
00:25:57,428 --> 00:25:58,929
Fourteen years.

00:25:59,306 --> 00:26:00,931
(WATCH BEEPING)

414
00:26:01,224 --> 00:26:02,933
Whoops. Uh-oh.

415
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:04,101
Gotta git.

416
00:26:04,144 --> 00:26:05,979
(STARTS ENGINE)
I'm late for
another appointment.

417
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:13,237
Sam, my man,
I got some good news.

418
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,239
I got the bank,
I got the account number.

419
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,158
Great. I'll call your
son-in-law's lawyer,

420
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,326
tell him we're going
to court.

421
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,704
Mr. Bowden,
your wife's
on line one.

422
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,748
Ask her to hold.
I got to make
a quick call.

423
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,917
I wouldn't make
that call, Sam.
The way I'd...

424
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:27,086
Mr. Bowden,
she says it's urgent.

425
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,592
Yeah?

426
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,641
...these kind of horrible,
high-pitched howls.

427
00:26:38,725 --> 00:26:41,352
They sounded like
he was screaming,

428
00:26:41,436 --> 00:26:42,771
and then Dani
came running in,

429
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:44,106
and I...

430
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,317
I called the vet.

431
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,572
Then it was so weird
because

432
00:26:55,035 --> 00:26:57,371
it was like
he was winding down,

433
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:01,583
just winding down
like an old clock.

434
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:04,921
And then,
all of a sudden,
he just stopped.

435
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:08,550
He had this kind of...

436
00:27:10,553 --> 00:27:13,514
His eyes just wide open,
and this kind of

437
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,309
surprised look.

438
00:27:19,147 --> 00:27:20,522
And then...

439
00:27:23,901 --> 00:27:25,528
And then he died.

440
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:30,992
He just died,
before the vet
even got here.

441
00:27:33,246 --> 00:27:34,872
What did the vet say?

442
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,665
That he was poisoned.

443
00:27:36,749 --> 00:27:37,875
Poisoned?

444
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:39,836
What kind of a poison?

445
00:27:41,213 --> 00:27:42,714
I don't know
what kind of poison.

446
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:43,798
Oh, Jesus!

447
00:27:43,883 --> 00:27:45,341
Leigh, I told you not
to let him out.

448
00:27:45,426 --> 00:27:46,676
I didn't let him out!

449
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,803
Well, then how...

450
00:27:47,888 --> 00:27:49,805
I didn't let him out!
Stop!

451
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,015
(DOOR SLAMS CLOSED)

452
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:53,058
I've got
an English Setter myself,

453
00:27:53,143 --> 00:27:55,479
so I don't cotton
to dog killers.

454
00:27:55,563 --> 00:27:58,607
Trouble is,
poisoning a dog
is just a fine.

455
00:27:59,317 --> 00:28:01,903
But if he's unemployed,
he got to have money

456
00:28:01,987 --> 00:28:03,571
or we'll bust him
for vagrancy.

457
00:28:03,655 --> 00:28:06,407
We'll give him
a full-body strip search.

458
00:28:07,993 --> 00:28:09,953
Jerk a knot
in his tail.

459
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:11,997
All right.

460
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:17,086
They got so many ways
on the books to lean
on an undesirable.

461
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:19,339
He'll feel about
as welcome around here

462
00:28:19,423 --> 00:28:20,548
as a case
of yellow fever.

463
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:21,841
OFFICER 1: Hands
against the wall.

464
00:28:21,926 --> 00:28:24,136
Spread them.
Spread them.

465
00:28:24,221 --> 00:28:26,222
That him?
OFFICER 2: Face the wall.

One-way mirror,
Mr. Bowden.

467
00:28:28,183 --> 00:28:29,725
He doesn't
know you're here.

468
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:31,603
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.

469
00:28:31,854 --> 00:28:33,522
Get the shirt off.

470
00:28:34,815 --> 00:28:36,274
Come on, hurry up.

471
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,361
Let's go.
Just pass it
over to him.

472
00:28:40,614 --> 00:28:42,156
Hand it to me.

473
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:43,741
All right.
Knock off the shoes.

474
00:28:44,994 --> 00:28:47,287
Hand them to
the other officer.

475
00:28:48,957 --> 00:28:51,291
Pass them to him.
Come on, come on.

476
00:28:53,587 --> 00:28:55,838
All right.
Let's put the arms out.

477
00:28:55,923 --> 00:28:57,799
Put your arms
out straight.

478
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:01,845
Roll your palms.

Do what he says.

479

(SCOFFS)

481

I don't know whether
to look at him
or read him.

Stand still.

483

One more step for you.
You know the routine.

484
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:33,006
Against the wall.

485
00:29:33,674 --> 00:29:37,094
We searched his apartment.
His car registration
and everything's in order.

486
00:29:37,178 --> 00:29:40,764
There's no guns or
any other weapons.
But we found these.

487
00:29:43,352 --> 00:29:45,270
ELGART: Cady's
savings account.

488
00:29:46,022 --> 00:29:47,147
$30,000?

489
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:50,109
Yeah, well, see,
his mother died
while he was serving

490
00:29:50,193 --> 00:29:52,278
and the farm
got sold off.
He got the proceeds.

491
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:55,448
Well, he's got money.
Where does that leave us?

492
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:57,284
ELGART: Well,
at the very least,
we nail him for the dog.

493
00:29:57,368 --> 00:29:58,410
Now, what happened?

494
00:29:58,703 --> 00:30:00,245
You let the dog out.
Cady abducted him.

495
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,371
No.

496
00:30:02,707 --> 00:30:04,584
We didn't
let the dog out.

497
00:30:05,794 --> 00:30:06,836
Cady came
into your house?

498
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,671
That's illegal entry
with intent.

499
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:11,967
Yeah. But he didn't
come in the house.

500
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:16,889
Look, I'm not a cop.
I don't know exactly
how he did it.

501
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:19,434
I just know that
he did it somehow.

502
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,686
That's not good enough,
Mr. Bowden.

503
00:30:21,771 --> 00:30:23,897
Now, you're a lawyer.
You damn well know that.

504
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:25,649
OFFICER 1:
Get off the pants.

505
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,531
Sooner or later,
he's gonna screw up.

506
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:34,242
I mean, the sheriff
assured me

507
00:30:34,327 --> 00:30:36,328
that they always do.
He's an ex-con.

508
00:30:36,412 --> 00:30:38,914
And then he's going
to get the message
in no uncertain terms.

509
00:30:38,998 --> 00:30:40,499
I'd still like

00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:52,768
And then
you didn't call.

683
00:38:54,854 --> 00:38:59,859
And by last night,
I was feeling
pretty reckless.

684
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:04,197
I thought about
what you said,
you know,

685
00:39:04,281 --> 00:39:08,285
that your wife,
she didn't know
I existed.

686
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:13,749
And I felt like
I was going
to show you.

687
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,001
(SOBBING)

688
00:39:15,795 --> 00:39:18,713
I guess I showed you,
all right, didn't I?

689
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:22,635
I guess
I really showed you.

690
00:39:27,391 --> 00:39:30,102
Lori, listen to me,
okay?

691
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:36,276
Now, look, this guy Cady,
he's done this kind
of thing before.

692
00:39:37,486 --> 00:39:40,905
Now, he's going to
do this over
and over again

693
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:44,326
unless you testify and
we take him to court...

694
00:39:44,411 --> 00:39:45,577
No. No. No.

695
00:39:45,662 --> 00:39:48,247
And press charges
and testify.

696
00:39:48,331 --> 00:39:50,124
Lori.
Sam.

697
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:54,587
Sam, I know,
I know how it works.
I see it every day.

698
00:39:55,548 --> 00:39:58,217
Only this time,
I'm on the other side.

699
00:39:59,303 --> 00:40:02,930
I don't want to
explain why I was
in a bar

700
00:40:03,015 --> 00:40:06,518
and how much
I had to drink and
what I was wearing.

701
00:40:06,602 --> 00:40:08,895
Not by the people
I work with.

702
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,151
Not by the guys that
I see cross-examine
other people on the stand,

703
00:40:13,235 --> 00:40:17,989
just crucify them
and just laugh
about it later.

704
00:40:19,576 --> 00:40:21,744
They'll even ask
about you.

705
00:40:23,538 --> 00:40:26,498
Lori, listen to me.
I don't care about that.

706
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:28,710
Well, I care about that.

707
00:40:30,046 --> 00:40:31,880
I'm sure you do, too.

708
00:40:33,174 --> 00:40:34,383
I'm...

709
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,721
I'm terribly sorry, Lori.
I'm just terribly sorry.

710
00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:43,268
ELGART: Look.

711
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:45,896
If all this is
something personal

712
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,522
between you and
the girl and Cady...

713
00:40:47,607 --> 00:40:49,108
Personal? I mean...

714
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,486
All right, come on,
Lieutenant.

715
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,820
All right.
What are you implying?

716
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:54,322
Only that there
are some things

717
00:40:54,406 --> 00:40:56,325
that are better
handled quietly.

718
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:58,077
Not by the police.
(LAUGHS)

719
00:40:58,912 --> 00:41:00,871
This Cady guy
is planning to
rape my wife,

720
00:41:00,955 --> 00:41:02,122
but it's not
your problem anymore?

721
00:41:02,457 --> 00:41:04,709
I can't bust someone
for planning to
rape your wife.

722
00:41:04,794 --> 00:41:07,295
You're a lawyer, Mr. Bowden.
You know that damn well.

723
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,631
Thanks all the same.
The way I'd handle it...

724
00:41:09,715 --> 00:41:11,884
What,
file a restraining order?
I already did.

725
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:14,053
Just think of
this fellow Cady
as a tiger.

726
00:41:14,304 --> 00:41:16,472
The trick is to
get him out
of the brush.

727
00:41:16,556 --> 00:41:18,016
Now how do we
do that?

728
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,936
You stake out
a couple of your goats
and hide in a tree.

729
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,312
What are you suggesting,
Lieutenant?

730
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,900
That I use
my family as bait?
And then what?

731
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,069
What? I'm gonna hope
that this psychopath

732
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,904
attacks my wife
and child?

733
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,572
And then what?
Blow his head off?

734
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:32,699
I'm a law officer.

735
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:36,078
It would be
unethical of me
to advise a citizen

736
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:38,163
to take the law
into his own hands.

737
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:40,667
So, I suppose you must've
misunderstood me.

738
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:42,168
Oh, I guess I must've.

739
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:45,463
Well, pardon me
all over the place.

740
00:42:11,453 --> 00:42:14,705
And he's been
harassing my family,
but he's clever.

741
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:17,667
I mean, cleverly,
so that the law
can't touch him.

742
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:19,461
Also I believe
that he's able to slip

743
00:42:19,545 --> 00:42:21,212
into the house
and out undetected.

744
00:42:21,297 --> 00:42:22,965
Although, is he out?
I can't tell.

745
00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:25,843
He's either out
or he's in.
I'm not sure.

746
00:42:25,927 --> 00:42:27,428
Well, I can't
see through walls,
Mr. Bowden.

747
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:31,099
I'm not asking you
to see through walls.
That's fine.

748
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:33,185
I mean,
why can't anybody
do anything for me?

749
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:35,228
What good are cops
and laws...

750
00:42:35,313 --> 00:42:37,064
Sam, Sam, Sam,
calm down.

751
00:42:37,149 --> 00:42:38,983
Let me explain
something to you.

752
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:41,819
See, the system
is set up to handle
generalized problems

753
00:42:41,904 --> 00:42:43,946
like burglary
and robbery.

754
00:42:44,574 --> 00:42:47,868
But if some lone creep
out there targets you
for some obscure reason,

755
00:42:47,952 --> 00:42:51,288
the system is
slow and skeptical.
It's pathetic even.

756
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,250
What's your connection
with this fellow?

757
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,460
(SIGHS)

758
00:42:55,669 --> 00:42:57,754
I was his lawyer,
his public defender.

759
00:42:57,838 --> 00:42:59,798
But you shafted
him somehow, right?
(LAUGHS)

760
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:02,676
Well, at least that's
the way he perceives it.
Sam, Sam.

761
00:43:02,761 --> 00:43:05,429
I don't care
what you did.
What did he do?

762
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,016
He raped
a 16-year-old girl.

763
00:43:09,143 --> 00:43:10,727
Do you have a daughter
around sixteen?

764
00:43:11,646 --> 00:43:12,896
She's fifteen.

765
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:14,941
All right.
Here's the deal.

766
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,484
I'll do a background check
on him,

767
00:43:16,568 --> 00:43:18,611
follow him for about a week
and write you up
a risk assessment.

768
00:43:18,695 --> 00:43:19,946
All right, good.
Great, great.

769
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,031
Now, the cops...

770
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:22,449
I can find him.

771
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:24,159
His name's Max Cady.
You already told me.

772
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,578
Just take it easy.
Stay calm.

773
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:30,166
Now, Dani, you can
just relax because

774
00:43:30,251 --> 00:43:33,962
your daddy has
a private investigator
on the payroll.

775
00:43:34,547 --> 00:43:36,090
Isn't that right?

776
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:39,969
What's your feeling
about him?
What, Sam Spade?

777
00:43:40,345 --> 00:43:42,806
Mickey Spillane?
Peter Gunn?

778
00:43:43,933 --> 00:43:45,725
Dirty Harry?
Perry Mason?

779
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,394
No, no, no, no.
Perry Mason...

780
00:43:47,478 --> 00:43:48,812
Perry Mason
was a lawyer.

781
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:50,731
No, the minute
I walked in
this guy's office,

782
00:43:50,816 --> 00:43:52,066
I felt totally relaxed.

783
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,151
I mean, this guy is
totally in charge.

784
00:43:54,236 --> 00:43:56,195
Kersek deals
with these types
for a living.

785
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,407
He looked like
he was going
to enjoy...

786
00:43:58,491 --> 00:43:59,783
(TELEPHONE RINGS)
(ALL GASP)

787
00:44:01,369 --> 00:44:03,078
Yes?
Yeah, it's me.

788
00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:05,540
After you left,
I had this interesting
conversation

789
00:44:05,624 --> 00:44:07,375
with a C.O. Over at
Statesboro prison.

790
00:44:07,585 --> 00:44:09,919
Mmm-hmm.
Seems our man Cady had
a job in the kitchen.

791
00:44:10,004 --> 00:44:11,005
Right.

792
00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:12,631
There was this other
inmate working in there
with him,

793
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:14,425
he was an obstinate
S. O.B.
Right.

794
00:44:14,926 --> 00:44:16,260
He hated Cady's
cigar smoke

795
00:44:16,344 --> 00:44:18,805
and he was always bitching
and moaning about it.

796
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,056
Well, one day,
they found him

797
00:44:20,141 --> 00:44:22,017
with his neck broke
and his tongue bit off.

798
00:44:22,101 --> 00:44:23,810
Oh, Jesus.
Yeah.

799
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,022
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

800
00:44:28,358 --> 00:44:30,860
KERSEK: They never could
place Cady near the scene
of the accident,

801
00:44:30,944 --> 00:44:34,197
if you want
to call it that,
at least not out loud.

802
00:44:35,074 --> 00:44:38,577
But the parole board,
they kept him in
for another seven years.

803
00:44:39,037 --> 00:44:41,456
Uh-oh.
The subject is on the move.
Get a good night's sleep.

804
00:44:42,374 --> 00:44:44,334
DANIELLE: Who was that?
Our private eye.

805
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,210
I thought
we were relaxed now.

WOMAN ON PHONE:
New Essex County Hospital.

807
00:44:50,258 --> 00:44:53,594
Yes, room 5036, please.

808
00:44:53,678 --> 00:44:54,721
One minute, please.

809
00:44:54,805 --> 00:44:55,930
All right.

810
00:44:56,557 --> 00:44:57,515
LORI ON PHONE: Hello?

811
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,059
Hi, Lori,
it's me, Sam.

812
00:44:59,143 --> 00:45:01,394
Lori, I just
feel God-awful

813
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:02,813
you got dragged
into this thing.

814
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:03,981
It's not your fault.

815
00:45:04,066 --> 00:45:06,776
If I had any idea
that Cady would hurt you

816
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,987
to get at me,
I would have warned you.

817
00:45:09,072 --> 00:45:11,990
Yeah, I know. I know.
I'm glad you called.

818
00:45:12,075 --> 00:45:13,742
Yeah. Yeah, well.

819
00:45:13,826 --> 00:45:15,535
I'm so sorry
about this.

820
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,288
I feel the same way.

821
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,334
So, are you
really determined

822
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,002
about moving back
to Connecticut?

823
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:25,005
Well, I've thought
about it a lot.

824
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,716
I just think it's
probably the best thing.

825
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:31,179
I thought that
maybe I could
go back to school.

826
00:45:31,972 --> 00:45:34,557
I'm really going
to miss you, though.

827
00:45:34,642 --> 00:45:36,559
Right.
Excuse me, Lori.

828
00:45:36,686 --> 00:45:38,521
You know,
that sounds real good.
Yeah.

829
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:40,690
That's gonna work out fine.
I'll get right back to you.

830
00:45:40,774 --> 00:45:42,608
Okay. Bye.
All right, bye.

831
00:45:46,906 --> 00:45:49,866
Well, I just don't know
what I hate more,

832
00:45:50,493 --> 00:45:55,289
that insipid tone
or your stupid,
sophomoric infidelities.

833
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:58,209
Who was that? Huh?

834
00:45:58,794 --> 00:45:59,878
The girl that
got beat up?

835
00:45:59,963 --> 00:46:01,130
Yes,
it was the girl
that got beat up.

836
00:46:01,214 --> 00:46:02,589
Lori Davis.
I already told you.

837
00:46:02,674 --> 00:46:04,925
She works at
the county courthouse.
She's a clerk.

838
00:46:05,343 --> 00:46:07,762
And what?
You're fucking her?

839
00:46:09,306 --> 00:46:11,141
Interesting choice, Sam.

840
00:46:11,225 --> 00:46:13,059
Calling from
our bedroom phone.

841
00:46:13,144 --> 00:46:15,062
You know, Leigh,
why is it that

842
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,440
whenever I have
a private phone
conversation,

843
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,818
you assume that
I'm fucking someone,
huh? Why is that?

844
00:46:20,902 --> 00:46:23,280
That's why
that psychopath
chose her, right?

845
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,449
Yes, yes, that's why
he chose her.

846
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,617
But I'm not
fucking her
in any way.

847
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:32,832
Well, you sleazy
son of a bitch!

848
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:34,250
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

849
00:46:34,334 --> 00:46:36,253
Goddamn you!
You son of a bitch!

850
00:46:36,337 --> 00:46:37,629
Stop it! Leigh!

851
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:40,090
Dani is
right downstairs.

852
00:46:41,217 --> 00:46:43,553
Oh. Oh, honey,
there's nothing
the matter.

853
00:46:43,637 --> 00:46:45,388
Yeah, I can see, Dad.

854
00:46:46,515 --> 00:46:49,434
LEIGH: I thought
you promised to leave all
that shit behind in Atlanta.

855
00:46:49,518 --> 00:46:50,853
SAM: What shit?

856
00:46:51,855 --> 00:46:53,105
(MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)
(ARGUMENT CONTINUES)

857
00:46:57,277 --> 00:46:58,570
LEIGH: Christ,
what a waste!

858
00:46:59,322 --> 00:47:00,530
The humiliation
we went through

859
00:47:00,615 --> 00:47:02,449
confessing all our
dirty little secrets

860
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:04,618
in those horrible sessions
with Dr. Hackett.

861
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,954
Yeah. We talked that
one damn incident
to death, didn't we?

862
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:08,164
Yeah.
Why did you bother?

863
00:47:08,248 --> 00:47:09,582
Because you
asked me to go.

864
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:10,917
I mean,
why did you bother?

865
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:12,544
Why did you bother?

866
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:16,381
Why did you bother
with you and me?
With the marriage?

867
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:20,345
Uprooting me and Dani?
Moving?

868
00:47:20,763 --> 00:47:22,222
Because that's
what we decided to do!

869
00:47:22,348 --> 00:47:24,432
You said that
you wanted to get out!
You don't get it, do you, Sam?

870
00:47:24,517 --> 00:47:25,642
All right, Leigh.
What is it I don't get?

871
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:26,852
You just don't get it.

872
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:28,729
SAM: What...
What don't I get?

873
00:47:28,814 --> 00:47:31,732
LEIGH: Why put us
through all of that!
Why?

874
00:47:32,317 --> 00:47:34,069
Nadine? (SNIFFLING)

875
00:47:34,237 --> 00:47:35,570
It's Dani.

876
00:47:37,073 --> 00:47:38,281
Nothing.

877
00:47:39,492 --> 00:47:41,702
I'm just
losing my mind here.

878
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:45,456
You don't have
the balls to walk out,

879
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:47,166
if that's
what you wanted.
Oh, what I wanted?

880
00:47:47,251 --> 00:47:49,795
Like I was going to split,
with you acting
the way you acted.

881
00:47:49,879 --> 00:47:51,255
Acting?
Yeah.

882
00:47:51,339 --> 00:47:54,383
You did some acting.
I don't remember
doing any acting.

883
00:47:54,717 --> 00:47:55,844
Oh, you don't remember
doing any acting?

884
00:47:55,928 --> 00:47:57,637
Well, hey,
let me refresh
your memory.

885
00:47:57,721 --> 00:47:59,889
Do you remember
not taking any work
for three months?

886
00:47:59,974 --> 00:48:01,891
Do you remember that?
You remember not
fixing any meals?

887
00:48:01,976 --> 00:48:03,936
I'm not on
fucking trial here!

888
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:07,273
Do you remember crying
every goddamn morning,
afternoon, every evening?

889
00:48:07,357 --> 00:48:09,108
Do you remember that?

890
00:48:12,196 --> 00:48:13,822
I scared you, huh?

891
00:48:15,116 --> 00:48:17,118
What did you think, Sam?

892
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:21,038
What did you think?
You thought maybe I was
going to kill myself?

893
00:48:21,123 --> 00:48:22,790
Over you?
Who else?

894
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:24,000
You pompous ass.

895
00:48:24,084 --> 00:48:25,836
Oh, God damn it, Leigh,
who knew what
you were gonna do?

896
00:48:25,962 --> 00:48:27,004
You wouldn't
leave the bedroom!

897
00:48:27,088 --> 00:48:28,839
Yeah. I wish you
could say the same.

898
00:48:28,923 --> 00:48:31,801
Now, look, isn't this
what Dr. Hackett
talked about?

899
00:48:31,886 --> 00:48:33,636
Digging up the past.

900
00:48:36,473 --> 00:48:37,807
I mean,
the relevant issue here

901
00:48:37,892 --> 00:48:39,810
is whether I've been
messing around
in New Essex.

902
00:48:39,895 --> 00:48:41,478
And I have not been.

903
00:48:41,563 --> 00:48:44,899
As far as this girl goes,
Lori, she's just a kid.

904
00:48:44,983 --> 00:48:46,359
Well,
that shouldn't stop you.

905
00:48:46,777 --> 00:48:47,944
She's a baby.

906
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:49,404
I mean, you know
when you gravitate
to people

907
00:48:49,488 --> 00:48:50,572
in the same world
as you...

908
00:48:50,656 --> 00:48:52,240
You gravitate to women.

909
00:48:52,325 --> 00:48:53,659
Oh, come on, Leigh,
for Christ sake,

910
00:48:53,744 --> 00:48:55,828
I'm a lawyer,
she's a clerk.
She looks up to me.

911
00:48:55,913 --> 00:48:58,706
She's just infatuated.
I can't help that.

912
00:49:02,879 --> 00:49:04,087
(SIGHS)

913
00:49:04,172 --> 00:49:06,131
Look, Leigh,
I'm scared.

914
00:49:06,841 --> 00:49:09,177
I think this
whole thing has...

915
00:49:11,096 --> 00:49:15,100
I keep feeling that
there is some animal
out there stalking us.

916
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:18,145
I think he wants
to hurt us
in the worst way

917
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,815
and that's got me
frightened to death.

918
00:49:26,238 --> 00:49:27,656
You really are scared,
aren't you?

919
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,115
Yeah.

920
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,327
Somebody finally
got to you.

921
00:49:32,871 --> 00:49:35,206
Look, Leigh,
I think...

922
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:37,334
I think that this guy
beat and raped her

923
00:49:37,418 --> 00:49:40,420
because he knew that
she wouldn't testify,

924
00:49:40,505 --> 00:49:43,048
that she wouldn't
press charges,

925
00:49:43,132 --> 00:49:45,218
because she knows
the system.

926
00:49:45,302 --> 00:49:46,970
I mean,
she works in it.

927
00:49:47,054 --> 00:49:49,472
She knows that
she'd be on trial.

928
00:49:51,393 --> 00:49:54,853
And then, because
she wouldn't testify,
you would assume that

929
00:49:54,938 --> 00:49:58,315
there was something
going on between us

930
00:49:58,401 --> 00:50:00,318
and it would
cause a rift.

931
00:50:03,364 --> 00:50:06,158
That we'd be much more
vulnerable to him.

932
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:14,126
I'm glad we talked
about this,

933
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,294
because now
we can work together.

934
00:50:16,671 --> 00:50:17,838
We can beat that
son of a bitch,

935
00:50:17,922 --> 00:50:21,259
the two of us together,
working as a team.

936
00:50:22,428 --> 00:50:23,803
(GROANS)

937
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,722
Jesus Christ.

938
00:50:26,098 --> 00:50:29,518
Oh, yeah, this is great.
This is something else.

939
00:50:29,602 --> 00:50:31,186
Oh. Oh.

940
00:50:32,105 --> 00:50:33,105
Oh, shit!

941
00:50:44,077 --> 00:50:45,536
Here you go.

942
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:46,871
I'm sorry,
I haven't ordered yet.

943
00:50:46,955 --> 00:50:50,083
That fellow over there
sent this over,
paid for and all.

944
00:50:50,168 --> 00:50:51,251
Who?

945
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:52,711
Which one?

946
00:50:52,795 --> 00:50:54,504
That guy who
is just leaving.

947
00:50:54,881 --> 00:50:55,881
(SIGHS)

948
00:50:58,135 --> 00:50:59,177
Excuse me.

949
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,180
Hey. Cady, come here.

950
00:51:03,057 --> 00:51:04,683
Wait up a second.

951
00:51:04,934 --> 00:51:08,228
I've been in
a real bad mood lately.
Shame, ain't it?

952
00:51:08,313 --> 00:51:09,563
You know what you can do
to brighten my mood?

953
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,817
No.
Get the hell
out of here.

954
00:51:13,819 --> 00:51:14,861
I don't mean just
this whole town,

955
00:51:14,945 --> 00:51:16,738
I mean the whole
goddamn state.

956
00:51:16,822 --> 00:51:18,491
I don't want to see you,
I don't want to hear you

957
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,451
and I don't want
to smell you.
Now, leave.

958
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,578
I like...
Are you my friend?

959
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,288
No, I'm not your friend.

960
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,583
Oh. 'Cause I thought
maybe you were my friend

961
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,835
because I like
to plan my comings
and goings with friends.

962
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,087
But if you're
not my friend,

963
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,213
and you're planning
my comings and goings,

964
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:32,380
I'd call that
presumptuous.

965
00:51:32,466 --> 00:51:34,634
In fact, I'd call it
downright rude,

966
00:51:34,718 --> 00:51:36,344
because I ain't
your porch-baby, buddy.

967
00:51:36,595 --> 00:51:39,222
Gee golly gosh.
I sure am sorry
I offended you,

968
00:51:39,306 --> 00:51:41,183
you white trash
piece of shit.

969
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:44,144
Ooh-ooh. I got
the all-over fidgets
on that one.

970
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:46,981
You've really shaken me up.
I'm shivering all over.

971
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:48,900
Ooh.

972
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:52,320
It's not necessary to
lay a foul tongue
on me, my friend.

973
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:55,950
I could get upset.
Things could get
out of hand.

974
00:51:56,284 --> 00:51:59,036
And then, in self-defense,
I could do something to you

975
00:51:59,121 --> 00:52:00,788
that you would not like,
right here.

976
00:52:00,872 --> 00:52:02,916
Anytime you
feel squirrelly,
you just jump.

977
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,920
You threatening me?

978
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,756
You catch on fast.

979
00:52:09,466 --> 00:52:10,800
'Cause I'm well
within my rights

980
00:52:10,884 --> 00:52:12,343
to be here
and you know it.

981
00:52:12,427 --> 00:52:14,220
If I stay here,
what you going to do?

982
00:52:14,304 --> 00:52:16,473
I don't give a rat's ass
about your rights.

983
00:52:16,558 --> 00:52:18,809
You just watch your step,
and you know what
I'm talking about.

984
00:52:18,893 --> 00:52:20,561
What are you gonna do?
Arrest me?

985
00:52:20,645 --> 00:52:22,479
You a cop?
Or were you a cop?

986
00:52:22,564 --> 00:52:24,732
Or were you not good enough
to remain on the force?

987
00:52:24,817 --> 00:52:26,860
'Cause, you know
that's the feeling
I'm getting here.

988
00:52:29,572 --> 00:52:31,907
Hope you enjoyed
your breakfast.

989
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:41,668
Ma'am,
this belong to you?

990
00:52:41,752 --> 00:52:42,711
LEIGH: Can I help you?

991
00:52:42,795 --> 00:52:44,129
I just found it.

992
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,841
I thought you
might need it back.

993
00:52:46,925 --> 00:52:49,135
Not to frighten you,
but if a dogcatcher

994
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:50,803
comes across a dog
without a license,

995
00:52:50,888 --> 00:52:52,014
he's liable to
think he's a stray

996
00:52:52,098 --> 00:52:54,725
and do God knows
what to it.

997
00:52:55,268 --> 00:52:58,770
You know,
our dog is...

998
00:52:59,857 --> 00:53:01,024
He passed away.

999
00:53:01,108 --> 00:53:02,442
Oh, what a shame.
Yeah.

1000
00:53:02,526 --> 00:53:04,986
Man's best friend and all.
Woman's, too.

1001
00:53:06,865 --> 00:53:09,158
Even without
closing my eyes,
I can picture him,

1002
00:53:09,242 --> 00:53:13,204
big, friendly, shaggy,
asleep at your feet,

1003
00:53:13,288 --> 00:53:14,998
keeping you company
while you're trying

1004
00:53:15,082 --> 00:53:18,126
to finish up those
pesky little sketches.

1005
00:53:21,256 --> 00:53:23,591
Oh, you're Max Cady,
aren't you?

1006
00:53:25,928 --> 00:53:29,640
You know, you better
get the hell out of here
before I call the police.

1007
00:53:29,724 --> 00:53:31,433
I'm not doing nothing.

1008
00:53:31,517 --> 00:53:32,851
Just giving you back
your dog collar.

1009
00:53:32,936 --> 00:53:34,186
I'm not on
your property.

1010
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,397
Oh, what'd you
come out here for,
you want to look around?

1011
00:53:36,482 --> 00:53:38,566
Go ahead, Mr. Cady,
take a good look.

1012
00:53:39,485 --> 00:53:40,652
Nice house.
Yeah.

1013
00:53:40,736 --> 00:53:43,656
It is a nice house.
You satisfied
now you've seen it?

1014
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:47,493
Or is there more? Huh?

1015
00:53:48,578 --> 00:53:49,955
Is that it?

1016
00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:52,415
There is going to
be more, isn't there,
Mr. Cady? Huh?

1017
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,876
You won't stop
until you're happy.

1018
00:53:55,461 --> 00:53:58,589
How can I be happy, Leigh,
when you're not happy?

1019
00:53:59,675 --> 00:54:01,634
You don't know
anything about me.

1020
00:54:01,718 --> 00:54:02,927
I know what I see,
ma'am.

1021
00:54:03,011 --> 00:54:04,011
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

1022
00:54:06,182 --> 00:54:07,891
I wanted to know
what you looked like.

1023
00:54:07,976 --> 00:54:09,559
I've been waiting
to see your face,

1024
00:54:09,644 --> 00:54:11,478
but you know now
that I see you,

1025
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:15,066
you are just repulsive.

1026
00:54:15,484 --> 00:54:16,776
I understand.
Yeah.

1027
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,778
I'm not your type.
No.

1028
00:54:18,863 --> 00:54:21,115
All that prison time
made me coarse.

1029
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:24,034
Guess I'm covered in
too many tattoos, huh?

1030
00:54:24,411 --> 00:54:26,121
But, you see,
there's not a whole
hell of a lot

1031
00:54:26,205 --> 00:54:29,666
to do in prison but
desecrate your flesh.

1032
00:54:30,042 --> 00:54:31,960
Of course it didn't
have to be that way
for either of us

1033
00:54:32,044 --> 00:54:34,755
if your husband
hadn't betrayed us both.

1034
00:54:35,507 --> 00:54:37,466
Who knows?
We might have been
different people.

1035
00:54:37,551 --> 00:54:39,927
We might have
been happy, Leigh.

1036
00:54:40,638 --> 00:54:42,222

on the phone!

Yo, Sam.

1041
00:54:59,576 --> 00:55:01,076
Sam, I thought
I'd catch you here.

1042
00:55:02,496 --> 00:55:04,289
Well, that little
smart aleck made me.

1043
00:55:04,373 --> 00:55:05,373
He what?

1044
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:06,458
Well, it wasn't
my fault.

1045
00:55:06,542 --> 00:55:07,792
He was looking
to be covered.

1046
00:55:07,877 --> 00:55:09,628
You're right. There is
a lot of cutsie-cutsie

1047
00:55:09,713 --> 00:55:10,796
in that little prick,
isn't there?

1048
00:55:10,881 --> 00:55:11,881
Yeah, I told you.

1049
00:55:11,965 --> 00:55:13,090
You know
where he was today?

1050
00:55:13,175 --> 00:55:16,260
At the public library reading
Thus Spake Zarathustra

1051
00:55:16,345 --> 00:55:18,472
by Friedrich Nietzsche,
he's this German philosopher.

1052
00:55:18,556 --> 00:55:19,681
He said that
God is dead.

1053
00:55:19,766 --> 00:55:20,849
God is dead. Right.

1054
00:55:20,933 --> 00:55:22,601
Look, we can keep
going this way,

1055
00:55:22,685 --> 00:55:24,812
but it's going to get
awful expensive, Sam.

1056
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:28,066
Well, look, I'm not so
concerned about days.

1057
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:29,942
Just stay on him
a few more nights,
will you?

1058
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:32,112
Look, do you really want
to resolve this situation?

1059
00:55:32,989 --> 00:55:34,323
Yes, I'd love
to resolve it.

1060
00:55:34,407 --> 00:55:35,574
Then I got
a suggestion.

1061
00:55:36,868 --> 00:55:38,953
There's men that
can be hired, by me,

1062
00:55:39,038 --> 00:55:41,039
to do a little job on Cady,
a little hospital job.

1063
00:55:45,419 --> 00:55:47,088
What are we
talking about here?

1064

1066

He won't be
so scary after that.

1067
00:55:53,888 --> 00:55:54,930
I'm a lawyer, right?

1068
00:55:55,056 --> 00:55:56,139
We agree that
I'm a lawyer?
Yeah.

From English or Drama?

Drama.

1086
00:56:49,033 --> 00:56:50,033

going down the list,

greeting my

00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:57,542

going on around here,

all that negativity,
you can use that.

1099

I tell you everything

you're going through,
it's okay, go with it.

The awkwardness
you feel, say,

1104

when you're walking
down the street

00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:32,999

is making fun
of your sexuality,

of the month
comes around,

won't let you
just grow up

00:57:40,842 --> 00:57:43,011
and be yourself,
be a woman.

1111

Go with it.
Don't suppress
or deny it.

and your work.

think about all that.

we deal with here.

See the book you have,
Thomas Wolfe?

01:02:13,569 --> 01:02:16,697
It's all about
self-discovery,
the inner voyage.

I like the end

1178
01:02:21,078 --> 01:02:26,750
where Eugene's journey...
It was really mystical,
you know,

1179
01:02:27,627 --> 01:02:30,546
and it was almost
like a pilgrimage.

1180
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,508
Almost like a cop-out,
if you ask me.

1181
01:02:33,759 --> 01:02:36,678
Although those were
the facts of Wolfe's life.

1182
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,349
The novel is
what you would call
a roman à clef.

01:02:45,898 --> 01:02:47,524
Well, nonetheless,
you can't escape

1186
01:02:47,608 --> 01:02:49,401
your demons just
by leaving home.

1187
01:02:50,278 --> 01:02:53,489
Although writers
do find new freedom
when they relocate abroad.

1188
01:02:53,574 --> 01:02:56,534
Take Henry Miller.
Have you read
his trilogy?

1189
01:02:56,618 --> 01:02:58,119
Plexus, Nexus
and Sexus?

1190
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,748
No. No.
You haven't
read that?

1191
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:04,334
You're missing
something.

1192
01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:09,132
Well, you know what?
I did read
Tropic of Cancer.

1193
01:03:10,134 --> 01:03:11,718
Just parts of it,
though,

1194
01:03:11,802 --> 01:03:15,639
because I had to
sneak it off my parents'
shelf, you know?

1195
01:03:16,224 --> 01:03:20,811
But his descriptions
are pretty vivid,
I would say.

1196
01:03:21,479 --> 01:03:23,940
In one of the novels,
I don't recall which,

1197
01:03:24,025 --> 01:03:26,860
he describes an erection
as a piece of lead
with wings on it.

1198
01:03:28,029 --> 01:03:29,655
I didn't read
that part.

1199
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:31,490
Of course not.
You're not allowed.

1200
01:03:31,575 --> 01:03:33,618
Your parents
don't want you to
achieve adulthood.

1201
01:03:33,702 --> 01:03:34,744
That's natural.

1202
01:03:34,828 --> 01:03:37,998
They know the pitfalls
of adulthood,
all that freedom.

1203
01:03:38,082 --> 01:03:40,125
They know it
only too well.

1204
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,880
Temptation to stray,
deflecting their guilt
and anger onto you

1205
01:03:43,964 --> 01:03:47,425
for a crime that's
not even a crime,
for smoking grass.

1206
01:03:53,183 --> 01:03:54,683
Wait a second.

1207
01:03:56,311 --> 01:03:57,436
Where are you from?

1208
01:03:59,106 --> 01:04:00,148
Where am I from?

1209
01:04:00,232 --> 01:04:02,025
Yeah.
Where do you think
I'm from?

1210
01:04:02,985 --> 01:04:04,611
I don't know, but...

1211
01:04:04,695 --> 01:04:06,989
If I told you,
you going to
get mad at me?

1212
01:04:07,449 --> 01:04:08,532
No.

1213
01:04:14,707 --> 01:04:16,875
I'm from
the black forest.

1214
01:04:20,547 --> 01:04:22,048
That's funny.

1215
01:04:23,217 --> 01:04:26,260
You're not
the Drama teacher,
are you?

1216
01:04:27,222 --> 01:04:29,056
Maybe I'm
the big bad wolf.

1217
01:04:31,184 --> 01:04:32,184
Umm...

1218
01:04:33,812 --> 01:04:37,399
So you're that guy
that's been hanging
around the house?

1219
01:04:38,067 --> 01:04:40,777
You're the one that
killed my mom's dog?

1220
01:04:42,072 --> 01:04:43,239
Your mom's dog
was killed?

1221
01:04:43,323 --> 01:04:44,490
Yeah.

1222
01:04:45,242 --> 01:04:47,827
I didn't even know
anything about that.

1223
01:04:47,911 --> 01:04:49,413
That's a shame.

1224
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:51,289
That's a damn shame.

1225
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:53,667
Yes, it was.

1226
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,920
What kind
of dog was it?

1227
01:04:56,714 --> 01:04:59,007
I don't know.
He was just...

1228
01:04:59,091 --> 01:05:01,300
He was fluffy, and...

1229
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:03,929
Fluffy?

1230
01:05:04,931 --> 01:05:06,390
Mmm-hmm.

1231
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:10,603
So you didn't do that?

1232
01:05:10,688 --> 01:05:12,772
Of course
I didn't do that.

1233
01:05:17,612 --> 01:05:18,904
Okay.

1234
01:05:18,989 --> 01:05:20,281
I wouldn't do that.

1235
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:23,868
So why... What are
you doing here, then?

1236
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:27,372
Well, I came to meet you,
to be honest with you.

1237
01:05:31,252 --> 01:05:32,295
Why? I mean...

1238
01:05:32,379 --> 01:05:33,379
Because

1239
01:05:34,965 --> 01:05:38,384
I wanted to meet you,
see what you're like.

1240
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:41,472
I see you're
a nice person.
That's all.

1241
01:05:44,976 --> 01:05:46,478
You're not going
to hurt me, are you?

1242
01:05:46,562 --> 01:05:48,563
I'm not going to
hurt you at all.

1243
01:05:48,647 --> 01:05:50,732
There's no
hurting here, Danielle.

1244
01:05:52,193 --> 01:05:54,445
Between us,
there's no anger,
nothing.

1245
01:05:54,529 --> 01:05:56,530
Just a search
for truth.

1246
01:05:57,657 --> 01:06:00,744
I mean, did you judge me,
did you get angry at me

1247
01:06:00,828 --> 01:06:02,496
when you caught me
smoking the grass?

1248
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:03,705
Hmm?

1249
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:04,873
No.

1250
01:06:06,334 --> 01:06:08,252
But your parents,
they judged you.

1251
01:06:08,337 --> 01:06:10,463
They got plenty angry
at you, didn't they?

1252
01:06:10,547 --> 01:06:11,756
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

1253
01:06:12,341 --> 01:06:14,801
They punished you
for their sins.

1254
01:06:15,845 --> 01:06:17,262
What did they do?

1255
01:06:17,347 --> 01:06:18,514
They...

1256
01:06:19,557 --> 01:06:22,936
My dad...
They just yelled
a whole lot

1257
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,647
and my mom cried

1258
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:29,275
and my dad said
I couldn't drive
the Cherokee.

1259
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,737
I would say
they punished you
for their sins,

1260
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:33,155
and you resent that,

1261
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,241
and you should
resent it.

1262
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:39,371
But Professor do-right has
a little advice for you.

1263
01:06:39,747 --> 01:06:41,289
You shouldn't
damn them.

1264
01:06:41,374 --> 01:06:43,125
Don't judge them.
Just forgive them,

1265
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:45,253
for they know not
what they do.

1266
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,297
Oh...
Um...

1267
01:06:48,382 --> 01:06:49,632
Why do you
hate my father?

1268
01:06:50,008 --> 01:06:53,387
I don't hate him at all.
Oh, no. I pray for him.

1269
01:06:54,055 --> 01:06:55,848
I'm here to help him.

1270
01:06:56,266 --> 01:06:59,310
I mean, we all
make mistakes,
Danielle.

1271
01:06:59,937 --> 01:07:02,689
You and I have.
But at least we try
to admit it.

1272
01:07:03,065 --> 01:07:04,399
Don't we?

1273
01:07:04,817 --> 01:07:05,985
Yeah.

1274
01:07:06,486 --> 01:07:08,279
But your daddy,
he don't.

1275
01:07:09,906 --> 01:07:13,660
Every man carries
a circle of hell around
his head like a halo.

1276
01:07:13,744 --> 01:07:14,911
Your daddy, too.

1277
01:07:15,037 --> 01:07:20,000
Every man, every man
has to go through hell
to reach his paradise.

1278
01:07:20,794 --> 01:07:22,795
You know
what paradise is?

1279
01:07:23,463 --> 01:07:25,047
No.
Salvation.

1280
01:07:26,592 --> 01:07:28,594
'Cause your daddy's
not happy.

1281
01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:30,095
Your mommy's
not happy.

1282
01:07:30,638 --> 01:07:33,849
And you know what?
You're not happy.

1283
01:07:35,394 --> 01:07:36,519
Are you?

1284
01:07:36,604 --> 01:07:37,729
No, I'm not.

1285
01:07:42,569 --> 01:07:44,570
You thought about me
last night, didn't you?

1286
01:07:44,654 --> 01:07:45,946
(LAUGHS)

1287
01:07:47,991 --> 01:07:48,991
Um...

1288
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:51,244
Yes, I did.

1289
01:07:52,121 --> 01:07:53,288
I know.

1290
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:59,253
You know, I think
I might have
found a companion,

1291
01:08:00,589 --> 01:08:03,507
a companion for
that long walk
to the light.

1292
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:09,014
Do you mind if
I put my arm
around you?

1293
01:08:13,395 --> 01:08:14,562
Um...

1294
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:23,864
It's okay.

1295
01:08:25,993 --> 01:08:27,661
No, I don't mind.

1296
01:08:28,788 --> 01:08:29,996
Okay.

1297
01:08:43,972 --> 01:08:45,264
(GIGGLES)

1298
01:09:43,539 --> 01:09:44,831
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1299
01:09:58,097 --> 01:10:00,183
Kersek, where the hell
have you been,
for Christ sake?

1300
01:10:00,267 --> 01:10:01,684
He came at my daughter
at school.

1301
01:10:01,769 --> 01:10:02,810
You asked me to
watch him nights.

1302
01:10:02,895 --> 01:10:05,063
I'm watching him nights.
What happened?

1303
01:10:05,147 --> 01:10:07,691
My wife, Leigh,
she found some marijuana

1304
01:10:07,776 --> 01:10:09,109
in one of
Dani's schoolbooks.

1305
01:10:09,194 --> 01:10:12,029
We don't know if Cady
gave it to her or
exactly what happened,

1306
01:10:12,113 --> 01:10:13,864
but she's scared and
she won't talk about it.

1307
01:10:13,948 --> 01:10:16,284
But now this has
gone far enough.
It's got to stop!

1308
01:10:16,369 --> 01:10:17,369
You phone the cops?

1309
01:10:17,453 --> 01:10:18,953
No, I didn't
phone the cops.

1310
01:10:19,038 --> 01:10:20,205
I mean, what did
you call them?

1311
01:10:20,289 --> 01:10:22,208
You call them "Slow,
skeptical, pathetic, even."

1312
01:10:22,334 --> 01:10:24,126
Dani.
No, Leigh,
that's all right.

1313
01:10:24,211 --> 01:10:26,087
Just hold on a minute.

1314
01:10:28,048 --> 01:10:31,176
Kersek, look,
I want to hire
those three guys,

1315
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,844
you remember,
the hospital job.

1316
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:35,639
Consider it done,
the sooner the better.

1317
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:38,101
Three men's going
to cost you a grand.

1318
01:10:38,185 --> 01:10:39,352
Now I know that's
not chicken feed,

1319
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:40,937
but you don't wanna go
with less than three.

1320
01:10:41,021 --> 01:10:43,065
It's better to
overdo it.

1321
01:10:43,149 --> 01:10:44,942
Okay.
You'll have the money
in the morning.

1322
01:10:45,026 --> 01:10:46,735
All right.
Then we'll be on
for tomorrow night.

1323
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:50,072
And Sam,
you'll feel good
about this.

1324
01:10:53,828 --> 01:10:54,953
All right.

1325
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,429
Do you notice
these young people?

1326
01:11:10,513 --> 01:11:12,014
They don't
look very happy.

1327
01:11:12,099 --> 01:11:14,725
They're committed
to their professions
and to their ambitions,

1328
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:16,269
but they're not
committed to each other.

1329
01:11:16,353 --> 01:11:18,354
Cady, shut up
and listen.

1330
01:11:19,816 --> 01:11:21,608
If you don't leave...

1331
01:11:22,068 --> 01:11:23,944
If you don't
leave my family alone

1332
01:11:24,028 --> 01:11:26,155
and if you don't
get out of here,

1333
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:29,367
you're going to be hurting
like you never dreamed.

1334
01:11:31,328 --> 01:11:32,328
Could you repeat that?

1335
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,455
I said,

1336
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,708
if you don't
get out of here,

1337
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,169
you're going to be hurting
like you never dreamed.

1338
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:40,463
A threat?
Yeah.

1339
01:11:40,547 --> 01:11:42,299
You bet your ass
that's a threat.

1340
01:11:42,383 --> 01:11:44,342
Well,
I have thought
of relocating

1341
01:11:44,427 --> 01:11:47,471
somewhere where I'd
be more appreciated,
California, perhaps.

1342
01:11:47,555 --> 01:11:50,224
I could teach
earthquake preparedness.

1343
01:11:50,726 --> 01:11:54,270
But then it hits me,
I love New Essex,
Counselor.

1344
01:11:55,523 --> 01:11:57,649
I mean,
where else could
I just casually confer

1345
01:11:57,734 --> 01:11:58,901
with an old colleague?

1346
01:11:58,985 --> 01:12:02,362
We're not colleagues.
Do you understand that?
We're not colleagues.

1347
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:03,573
Still think you're
better than me.

1348
01:12:03,657 --> 01:12:04,949
No, I don't think
I'm better than you.

1349
01:12:05,034 --> 01:12:06,493
That's not
the goddamned point.

1350
01:12:06,577 --> 01:12:08,453
Good. 'Cause if
you're not better than me,

1351
01:12:08,537 --> 01:12:10,247
then I can have
what you have.

1352
01:12:10,999 --> 01:12:12,082
What do I have?

1353
01:12:12,459 --> 01:12:14,210
A wife, a daughter.

1354
01:12:16,588 --> 01:12:19,758
I'm going to teach you
the meaning of commitment.

1355
01:12:20,092 --> 01:12:22,219
Fourteen years ago,
I was forced to make

1356
01:12:22,303 --> 01:12:24,137
a commitment to
an eight-by-nine cell

1357
01:12:24,222 --> 01:12:27,266
and now you're
going to be forced
to make a commitment.

1358
01:12:27,351 --> 01:12:29,810
You could say I'm here
to save you.

1359
01:12:33,107 --> 01:12:34,191
Fine.

1360
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:37,444
Check out the Bible,
Counselor,

1361
01:12:37,529 --> 01:12:39,322
the book between
Esther and Psalms.

1362
01:12:46,331 --> 01:12:48,123
Dani? Dani?

1363
01:12:50,585 --> 01:12:52,086
You all right?

1364
01:12:53,046 --> 01:12:54,381
What?
Is everything
all right?

1365
01:12:54,465 --> 01:12:55,549
Yeah.

1366
01:12:58,803 --> 01:13:01,013
This isn't going
to work, you know.

1367
01:13:01,098 --> 01:13:02,557
What isn't going
to work?

1368
01:13:02,808 --> 01:13:05,309
Locking us in,
hiding us from the world.

1369
01:13:05,644 --> 01:13:07,311
Oh, don't be
so dramatic, Dani.

1370
01:13:07,646 --> 01:13:09,231
Making me stay out
of school.

1371
01:13:09,315 --> 01:13:11,233
You're going back
to school tomorrow.

1372
01:13:11,317 --> 01:13:12,442
And put
some clothes on.

1373
01:13:12,527 --> 01:13:14,027
You're not
a little kid anymore.

1374
01:13:14,195 --> 01:13:16,781
Yeah? Then why
am I going back
to school tomorrow?

1375
01:13:16,865 --> 01:13:18,116
What are you
going to do?

1376
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,660
That's none of
your concern, Dani.

1377
01:13:22,747 --> 01:13:27,334
Dad, he didn't
force himself
on me, you know.

1378
01:13:28,295 --> 01:13:30,171
I know you'd like
to think that he did.

1379
01:13:31,424 --> 01:13:33,216
But I think he was...

1380
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:37,555
I think he was
just trying to make
a connection with me.

1381
01:13:37,848 --> 01:13:38,889
You know?
Now, Dani,

1382
01:13:39,558 --> 01:13:41,017
I want you to
listen to me.

1383
01:13:41,101 --> 01:13:43,686
All right? No.
Do you understand?

1384
01:13:44,188 --> 01:13:48,066
No. There will never
be any connection

1385
01:13:48,151 --> 01:13:51,154
between you
and Max Cady.

1386
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:54,532
You understand that?

1387
01:14:04,252 --> 01:14:05,377
Did he touch you?

1388
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,047
(CHUCKLES)

1389
01:14:08,716 --> 01:14:12,135
What are you
laughing about?
Why are you smiling?

1390
01:14:12,219 --> 01:14:14,847
I'm asking you a question.
Did he touch you?

1391
01:14:16,099 --> 01:14:17,892
Dani, wipe that
smile off your face!

1392
01:14:17,976 --> 01:14:20,354
I'm asking you,
did he touch you?

1393
01:14:27,153 --> 01:14:29,364
No, no, no, wait, Dani.
I'm sorry.

1394
01:14:30,074 --> 01:14:31,574
No, I'm sorry.

1395
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:34,536
Wait, honey.
I'm sorry.

1396
01:14:34,621 --> 01:14:37,122
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

1397
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:43,546
(DOOR CLOSES)

1398
01:15:00,733 --> 01:15:01,900
THUG: Max?

1399
01:15:02,443 --> 01:15:03,778
(GRUNTING)

1400
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:46,200
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1401
01:15:46,326 --> 01:15:47,619
Come on.

1402
01:15:48,955 --> 01:15:50,289

1404
01:16:16,487 --> 01:16:21,866
Counselor?

1405
01:16:22,743 --> 01:16:24,119
Is that you?

1406
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:26,955
Counselor?

1407
01:16:27,999 --> 01:16:30,919
(SINGSONG VOICE)
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1408
01:16:45,478 --> 01:16:47,437
I ain't no white trash
piece of shit.

1409
01:16:47,522 --> 01:16:49,481
I'm better
than you all.

1410
01:16:52,402 --> 01:16:54,153
I can out-learn you.

1411
01:16:55,614 --> 01:16:57,573
I can out-read you.

1412
01:16:57,658 --> 01:17:02,371
I can outthink you,
and I can
out-philosophize you.

1413
01:17:02,664 --> 01:17:04,998
And I'm going
to outlast you.

1414
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:06,458
You think
a couple of whacks

1415
01:17:06,544 --> 01:17:09,212
to my good-old-boy gut's
gonna get me down?

1416
01:17:09,713 --> 01:17:12,006
It's going to
take a hell of a lot more
than that, Counselor,

1417
01:17:12,091 --> 01:17:14,343
to prove you're
better than me!

1418
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:20,891
"I am like God,
and God like me.

1419
01:17:20,977 --> 01:17:23,687
"I am as large as God.

1420
01:17:23,771 --> 01:17:26,773
"He is as small as I.

1421
01:17:26,858 --> 01:17:31,195
"He cannot above me
nor I beneath him be."

1422
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:36,368
Silesius,
17th century.

1423
01:17:41,332 --> 01:17:45,962
Counselor?

1424
01:17:48,632 --> 01:17:53,637
Could you be there?

1425
01:17:54,681 --> 01:17:55,931
(WHISTLES)

1426
01:17:57,184 --> 01:17:58,184
(WHISTLES AGAIN)

1427
01:17:59,061 --> 01:18:00,395
Counselor?

1428
01:18:08,155 --> 01:18:10,072
I wonder
if you're here.

1429
01:18:19,627 --> 01:18:20,835
Fuck it.

1430
01:18:22,212 --> 01:18:25,298
If you're here,
what the fuck's
the difference?

1431
01:18:26,217 --> 01:18:27,468
Fuck it!

1432
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:39,064
WOMAN: I've got
Mr. Kersek on one.

1433
01:18:39,148 --> 01:18:40,357
SAM: Good.
I'll take it.

1434
01:18:40,441 --> 01:18:41,525
Tom.

1435
01:18:42,444 --> 01:18:44,153
Sam, you look tired.
You get that writ?

1436
01:18:44,237 --> 01:18:47,615
No, no, we got to
get into that.
Let me just grab this.

1437
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:49,493
Kersek.
Look, I'm damn sorry
about last night.

1438
01:18:49,577 --> 01:18:50,661
That son of a bitch
could survive

1439
01:18:50,745 --> 01:18:51,870
a preemptive
nuclear strike.

1440
01:18:51,955 --> 01:18:53,246
All right.
Hang on a second.
Hang on a second.

1441
01:18:53,748 --> 01:18:55,875
Tom, I'm not doing it.
I pulled a fast one

1442
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,544
and it's come back and
it's bit me on the ass
in a major way.

1443
01:18:58,629 --> 01:18:59,671
What you did was dumb.

1444
01:18:59,755 --> 01:19:02,883
What I'm asking here
is no big deal, Sam.
This is my daughter!

1445
01:19:03,218 --> 01:19:04,635
No, Tom, it's perjury
and it's bullshit

1446
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,178
and I'm not doing it!
Now, excuse me.

1447
01:19:06,638 --> 01:19:08,389
All right?
All right.
I'll be in my office.

1448
01:19:09,015 --> 01:19:10,725
Tom, who was that
top criminal lawyer?

1449
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:12,560
Lee Heller.
Kersek.

1450
01:19:12,645 --> 01:19:13,812
We need to talk.
KERSEK: Trouble is

1451
01:19:13,896 --> 01:19:16,189
if word gets out
how Cady bushwhacked
those poor bastards,

1452
01:19:16,273 --> 01:19:17,817
it's gonna be
a bitch to line up
three new guys.

1453
01:19:17,901 --> 01:19:20,403
I don't want three new guys.
No more guys, you hear me?

1454
01:19:20,487 --> 01:19:22,279
Mr. Heller,
it's Sam Bowden

1455
01:19:22,364 --> 01:19:24,074
from Broadbent
and Denmeyer.

1456
01:19:25,034 --> 01:19:26,284
Tom speaks
very highly of you.

1457
01:19:26,369 --> 01:19:27,619
In fact,
he says you're the best,

1458
01:19:27,704 --> 01:19:28,912
and the best is
what I need right now.

1459
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:31,249
HELLER: (ON PHONE)
We froze our butts
together in Korea.

1460
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:32,667
How can I help you,
Sam?

1461
01:19:32,751 --> 01:19:35,503
Well, it's a simple petition
for a restraining order,

1462
01:19:35,587 --> 01:19:37,380
but there's been
some complications.

1463
01:19:37,464 --> 01:19:38,841
Now,
I know this is
short notice,

1464
01:19:38,925 --> 01:19:40,843
but look,
I need this injunction.

1465
01:19:40,927 --> 01:19:43,512
You see,
there's an ex-convict
by the name of Max Cady,

1466
01:19:43,596 --> 01:19:44,638
he's been
harassing my family.

1467
01:19:44,723 --> 01:19:48,268
I'm sorry, Mr. Bowden.
I can't continue
this conversation.

1468
01:19:48,352 --> 01:19:50,061
Well, is there
a more convenient time?

1469
01:19:50,146 --> 01:19:52,731
No, no. The damn thing
is I have a conflict.

1470
01:19:52,815 --> 01:19:54,608
Now, what would
that be?
Well, you see,

1471
01:19:54,693 --> 01:19:57,528
Mr. Cady retained
my services
as of yesterday.

1472
01:19:57,612 --> 01:19:58,654
He what?

1473
01:19:58,739 --> 01:20:00,657
In fact,
I see on my phone sheet

1474
01:20:00,742 --> 01:20:02,284
Mr. Cady called
this morning,

1475
01:20:02,368 --> 01:20:03,452
so I'm sure
he'll fill me in...

1476
01:20:03,536 --> 01:20:07,164
But wait a minute, Lee.
Now, look, this man
is a psychotic.

1477
01:20:07,248 --> 01:20:10,793
It appears
I'll be seeing you at
that hearing after all.

1478
01:20:12,588 --> 01:20:13,796
CADY ON TAPE:
Could you repeat that?

1479
01:20:13,881 --> 01:20:16,050
SAM ON TAPE: I said
if you don't leave...

1480
01:20:17,052 --> 01:20:18,886
If you don't
leave my family alone

1481
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:21,138
and if you don't
get out of here,

1482
01:20:21,222 --> 01:20:24,309
you're gonna be hurting
like you never dreamed.

1483
01:20:25,311 --> 01:20:26,269
A threat?

1484
01:20:26,353 --> 01:20:28,772
Yeah, you bet your ass
that's a threat.

1485
01:20:29,983 --> 01:20:34,070
HELLER:
You need only glance
at my client to know

1486
01:20:34,905 --> 01:20:37,115
that Mr. Bowden
made good

1487
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:40,535
on his heinous
and cowardly threat.

1488
01:20:41,079 --> 01:20:43,413
Just as God arose
to judgment

1489
01:20:43,498 --> 01:20:45,291
to save all the meek
of the earth,

1490
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:48,294
I hope and pray
you will do
the same, sir.

1491
01:20:48,378 --> 01:20:49,962
Your Honor,
(CLEARS THROAT)

1492
01:20:50,714 --> 01:20:53,926
Mr. Cady wouldn't
have surreptitiously
taped our meeting

1493
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:56,136
unless he knew
that he'd...

1494
01:20:57,806 --> 01:21:01,684
This court
does not condone

1495
01:21:02,645 --> 01:21:06,690
feuds, vendettas
or vigilantism.

1496
01:21:07,275 --> 01:21:12,071
Let me quote our
great Negro educator,
Mr. Booker T. Washington.

1497
01:21:12,865 --> 01:21:17,119
"I will let no man
drag me down so low

1498
01:21:18,287 --> 01:21:20,706
"as to make me
hate him."

1499
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:21,874
Yes.

1500
01:21:22,709 --> 01:21:25,378
I will grant
the restraining order

1501
01:21:25,462 --> 01:21:28,966
not to validate
the malice between you,

1502
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:34,138
but in the interest
of Christian harmony.

1503
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,810
You may not come
within 500 yards

1504
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:43,482
of Mr. Maximilian Cady

1505
01:21:44,234 --> 01:21:48,989
until such time
as the court may
lift the injunction.

1506
01:21:50,616 --> 01:21:54,578
King Solomon could
not have adjudicated
more wisely, Your Honor.

1507
01:21:55,371 --> 01:22:00,042
I am so offended by
the philistine tactics
of Mr. Bowden,

1508
01:22:00,127 --> 01:22:04,339
I petitioned the A. B.A.
For his disbarment

1509
01:22:04,424 --> 01:22:06,842
on the grounds of
moral turpitude.

1510
01:22:07,177 --> 01:22:10,179
Now, if you will
excuse us, my client...

1511
01:22:10,263 --> 01:22:11,264
Come on, son...

1512
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:13,099
Is due back
at the hospital

1513
01:22:15,728 --> 01:22:20,149
for the results of
his numerous X-rays.

1514
01:22:22,736 --> 01:22:23,861
Kersek, I want a gun.

1515
01:22:24,321 --> 01:22:25,530
I need a gun.
I want a gun.

1516
01:22:25,615 --> 01:22:26,781
You want a gun?

1517
01:22:26,866 --> 01:22:27,949
Yeah, I need a gun.

1518
01:22:28,618 --> 01:22:29,701
Know anything
about guns?
No.

1519
01:22:29,785 --> 01:22:30,869
No, I don't believe
in them.

1520
01:22:30,953 --> 01:22:32,413
I never had them
around the house
or anything.

1521
01:22:32,497 --> 01:22:33,539
All right,
I'll get you a gun.

1522
01:22:33,624 --> 01:22:35,041
What kind of
gun you want?
Now, calm down.

1523
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:37,126
Well, just something simple,
something I can handle.

1524
01:22:37,211 --> 01:22:40,214
Let me see
what fits you. A.45...

1525
01:22:40,298 --> 01:22:41,590
Let me see your hands.
Okay.

1526
01:22:43,468 --> 01:22:45,719
A.38 snub-nosed
special. Yeah.
All right. Good.

1527
01:22:45,803 --> 01:22:48,056
That'll do. I can even
teach you how to use it.

1528
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:50,016
All right. Great.
The first lesson
is this.

1529
01:22:50,517 --> 01:22:52,894
Don't think of it
as shooting a man
or trying to kill him.

1530
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:55,064
Right.
Think of it as
an extension of your fist.

1531
01:22:55,148 --> 01:22:57,149
You're just reaching out
and knocking the man down.

1532
01:22:57,817 --> 01:22:58,817
All right.

1533
01:22:58,902 --> 01:23:01,028
Later on we can
go out to the woods
and shoot some trees, okay?

1534
01:23:01,113 --> 01:23:03,782
That'd be great.
That'd be great. Good.

1535
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:07,661
What is it? What?

1536
01:23:07,745 --> 01:23:09,580
Well, Sam...
Yeah?

1537
01:23:09,665 --> 01:23:12,124
I give you a gun.
You pull it on Cady,

1538
01:23:12,209 --> 01:23:13,251
and it's gonna
dawn on you

1539
01:23:13,335 --> 01:23:14,335
that shooting a man
is different

1540
01:23:14,419 --> 01:23:16,213
than blowing holes
in some tree.

1541
01:23:16,297 --> 01:23:18,507
Next thing, you know,
you don't have my gun,
Cady does.

1542
01:23:19,008 --> 01:23:20,050
No, no, no.
You're gonna teach me.

1543
01:23:20,134 --> 01:23:21,551
I know how
to handle a gun.

1544
01:23:21,636 --> 01:23:22,762
He won't take it
away from me.

1545
01:23:22,846 --> 01:23:25,807
Best-case scenario,
you kill Cady dog-dead.

1546
01:23:26,809 --> 01:23:30,187
Fifteen years to life.
Do you realize that,
Counselor?

1547
01:23:35,986 --> 01:23:38,863
Oh, Jesus!
It's all fucked up,
Kersek!

1548
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:40,991
I mean,
the law considers me

1549
01:23:41,075 --> 01:23:42,909
more of a loose cannon
than Max Cady!

1550
01:23:42,994 --> 01:23:45,288
Some big-shit attorney
has whipped

1551
01:23:45,372 --> 01:23:47,623
the A. B.A.'s
ethics committee
into a frenzy.

1552
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:50,960
There's an emergency session
in Raleigh over the assault.

1553
01:23:51,336 --> 01:23:53,046
How did they link that
to you?

1554
01:23:53,214 --> 01:23:57,342
I went to warn Cady.
I thought it was
the decent thing to do.

1555
01:23:57,427 --> 01:24:00,388
Maybe I'd scare him.
And he was wired.

1556
01:24:03,142 --> 01:24:04,976
Goddamn fools.

1557
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,316
This hearing,
it's real important?

1558
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,900
(LAUGHS)

1559
01:24:12,569 --> 01:24:16,072
Only if I want to continue
to practice law. Yeah.

1560
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:18,241
Cady isn't
expected there, is he?

1561
01:24:18,743 --> 01:24:22,038
Oh, no, no, no.
Mr. Cady,
he's beyond reproach.

1562
01:24:22,164 --> 01:24:23,831
But you're required
to be there.
Yeah.

1563
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:26,167
When is this hearing?

1564
01:24:26,251 --> 01:24:28,337
It's Thursday morning,
9:00.

1565
01:24:28,421 --> 01:24:31,173
The torture begins
and lasts for two days.

1566
01:24:32,383 --> 01:24:33,675
You have to fly up
the night before?

1567
01:24:34,635 --> 01:24:35,803
Right.

1568
01:24:36,722 --> 01:24:38,514
Cady's an opportunist.

1569
01:24:38,599 --> 01:24:40,558
If he thinks
you're gonna be out
of town for two days,

1570
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:43,354
that's going to be
as tempting to him
as shit is to a fly.

1571
01:24:44,105 --> 01:24:45,689
If Cady breaks
into your home,

1572
01:24:45,774 --> 01:24:47,483
he can be killed.

1573
01:24:47,567 --> 01:24:48,942
Justifiably.

1574
01:24:50,988 --> 01:24:53,740
But he won't show
unless he's real sure
you're not gonna be there.

1575
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:33,160
(SWITCHING STATIONS)

1576
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:36,789
(CHOIR SINGING)

1577
01:26:02,987 --> 01:26:03,987
Have a good trip.

1578
01:26:04,071 --> 01:26:05,780
All right. Bye-bye.

1579
01:26:05,865 --> 01:26:06,865
Call us tonight, okay?

1580
01:26:06,949 --> 01:26:08,283
All right.

1581
01:26:18,713 --> 01:26:20,297
I didn't miss
the 9:20 to Raleigh?

1582
01:26:20,381 --> 01:26:22,674
I'm afraid you did, sir.
But there's a 10:20.

1583
01:26:22,758 --> 01:26:23,843
Oh, it's not that.

1584
01:26:23,927 --> 01:26:26,888
I just have some very,
very important papers
for Samuel Bowden.

1585
01:26:27,389 --> 01:26:28,639
Was he on the 9:20?

1586
01:26:29,558 --> 01:26:31,268
We can't give out
that information, sir.

1587
01:26:32,061 --> 01:26:33,562
Well, it's just...

1588
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:36,231
I guess I could send it
to him overnight,

1589
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:40,069
but he might be back,
for all I know,
tomorrow morning, and I...

1590
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:42,739
See, I...

1591
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:46,410
My wife and I have
been in an accident,
and he's our lawyer.

1592
01:26:46,495 --> 01:26:50,664
And if I don't get
in touch with him,
we could lose this case.

1593
01:26:50,749 --> 01:26:53,668
We've already lost
our little daughter, Dani.

1594
01:26:54,921 --> 01:26:56,046
Is...

1595
01:26:57,757 --> 01:26:58,924
Is there any way
I can find out

1596
01:26:59,008 --> 01:27:01,719
if he was on that flight
and when he's coming back?

1597
01:27:01,803 --> 01:27:03,930
It'd really,
really help us.

1598
01:27:06,517 --> 01:27:07,601
(KEYS CLATTERING)

1599
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:16,027
He'll be back the day
after tomorrow, sir.

1600
01:27:16,779 --> 01:27:18,404
Bless your heart.

1601
01:27:33,631 --> 01:27:35,215
(SOFTLY)
Go on. Go on in.

1602
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:39,470
Get down, Sam.

1603
01:27:44,852 --> 01:27:47,104
(BANGING ON DOOR)
Leigh. Leigh,
give me a cigarette.

1604
01:27:48,481 --> 01:27:49,648
You better
slow down, Sam.

1605
01:27:49,732 --> 01:27:51,693
You're outpacing me
two-to-one since
you started smoking.

1606
01:27:51,777 --> 01:27:54,404
Just keep track of
how many I owe you.

1607
01:27:56,323 --> 01:27:57,448
So, how'd it go
at the airport?

1608
01:27:57,533 --> 01:27:58,742
Well, we did our thing,

1609
01:27:58,827 --> 01:28:00,160
but we don't know
if he saw us,

1610
01:28:00,245 --> 01:28:02,288
we don't even know
if he was there.

1611
01:28:02,789 --> 01:28:04,832
Set the trap
and we'll see.

1612
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,543
What if we don't
want to see?

1613
01:28:06,919 --> 01:28:08,295
Dani!
DANIELLE: What?

1614
01:28:08,588 --> 01:28:10,463
Maybe he
poisoned the dog.

1615
01:28:10,798 --> 01:28:12,758
Dani...
Sam, watch out
for the windows.

1616
01:28:12,843 --> 01:28:15,845
Yeah, you're not
allowed to stand up,
Dad, remember?

1617
01:28:22,437 --> 01:28:23,604
Didn't Cady
go after her?

1618
01:28:23,688 --> 01:28:24,855
LEIGH:
You don't know Dani.

1619
01:28:24,939 --> 01:28:26,941
If she finds
a palmetto bug
in her bedroom,

1620
01:28:27,026 --> 01:28:28,776
she takes it outside.

1621
01:28:28,861 --> 01:28:31,237
You know, she could
never kill anything.

1622
01:28:31,322 --> 01:28:32,780
Even a six-foot
palmetto bug?

1623
01:28:32,865 --> 01:28:34,199
(LAUGHS)

1624
01:28:35,702 --> 01:28:37,202
Oh, God.

1625
01:28:46,005 --> 01:28:47,047
What is that?

1626
01:28:48,299 --> 01:28:51,761
It's a monofilament line.
I got it from
Sam's fishing gear.

1627
01:28:51,845 --> 01:28:54,513
See, what I do is
I stretch it across
the windows and the doors

1628
01:28:54,598 --> 01:28:56,600
and tie it to
Dani's teddy bear here.

1629
01:28:56,684 --> 01:28:58,268
If the bear moves
a quarter of an inch,

1630
01:28:58,353 --> 01:28:59,895
I'll know
if the holy ghost
is sneaking in.

1631
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,892
What are you reading?

1632
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,148
Why? Did Kersek quit?

1633
01:29:39,233 --> 01:29:40,316
No.

1634
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,194
It's just
that Cady said...

1635
01:29:43,278 --> 01:29:45,113
You want some answers.

1636
01:29:46,616 --> 01:29:47,825
Me, too.

1637
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:54,999
I'd like to know just
how strong we are
or how weak.

1638
01:29:57,628 --> 01:29:59,421
But I guess
the only way we're going
to find that out

1639
01:29:59,505 --> 01:30:02,675
is just by
going through this.

1640
01:30:06,513 --> 01:30:10,308
It's just that Cady said
to read the book between
Esther and Psalms.

1641
01:30:11,227 --> 01:30:12,853
Which is which one?

1642
01:30:13,354 --> 01:30:14,980
The Book of Job.

1643
01:30:18,152 --> 01:30:20,987
Job was a good man.
He believed in God

1644
01:30:22,114 --> 01:30:24,116
and God tested
his faith.

1645
01:30:24,534 --> 01:30:26,827
He took away
everything he had,

1646
01:30:28,455 --> 01:30:30,206
even his children.

1647
01:30:34,003 --> 01:30:35,295
(GASPS)

1648
01:30:46,517 --> 01:30:49,436
DANIELLE:
It's hideous, this plan.
I mean, barbaric.

1649
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:53,024
They're crazy.
My dad's turned
into some kind of...

1650
01:30:53,108 --> 01:30:54,275
I don't know what.

1651
01:30:54,359 --> 01:30:55,651
Barbaric.

1652
01:30:55,736 --> 01:30:57,612
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1653
01:30:59,032 --> 01:31:03,285
Listen to your father.
Do what they say.
What else you can do?

1654
01:31:03,369 --> 01:31:06,331
Leave. We could go
to the houseboat,
you know,

1655
01:31:06,415 --> 01:31:08,458
and get lost
in any inlet.

1656
01:31:13,215 --> 01:31:14,715
Dani, come on.

1657
01:31:15,217 --> 01:31:16,926
Don't stay outside.

1658
01:31:23,643 --> 01:31:28,064
You wanna know what
really disturbs me?
It's killing this guy.

1659
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:31,526
I mean,
taking a man's life.

1660
01:31:33,445 --> 01:31:36,073
I don't know if
I can live with that.

1661
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:38,283
You may have to.

1662
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:40,452
Sam, just remember
the plan.
I know the plan.

1663
01:31:41,412 --> 01:31:43,915
Damn, it's premeditated.
It's...

1664
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:47,585
It makes me an accomplice,
an accessory, an abettor.

1665
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:49,964
It's also excessive force.

1666
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:52,842
Sam,
the only thing excessive
we could do to Cady

1667
01:31:52,926 --> 01:31:55,845
would be to gut him
and eat his liver.

1668
01:31:55,929 --> 01:31:57,055
That might
be excessive.

1669
01:31:57,139 --> 01:31:59,391
Jesus Christ,
Kersek, I'm serious.

1670
01:31:59,475 --> 01:32:01,685
No, you're scared.

1671
01:32:02,228 --> 01:32:05,731
But that's okay.
I want you to
savor that fear.

1672
01:32:06,441 --> 01:32:08,651
You know,
the South evolved in fear.

1673
01:32:08,735 --> 01:32:12,948
Fear of the Indian,
fear of the slave,
fear of the damn Union.

1674
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:17,286
The South has
a fine tradition
of savoring fear.

1675
01:32:26,381 --> 01:32:27,882
(INAUDIBLE)

1676
01:32:34,932 --> 01:32:36,600
SAM: What's the matter?

1677
01:32:37,143 --> 01:32:39,269
Don't look over!
Don't look.

1678
01:32:39,645 --> 01:32:41,606
(WHISPERING)
She's making me nervous.

1679
01:32:42,983 --> 01:32:44,567
What would
she normally do

1680
01:32:44,651 --> 01:32:46,402
if Sam wasn't around
to run her home?

1681
01:32:46,737 --> 01:32:48,155
She'd stay...
SAM: She'd stay over.

1682
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:51,074
Well, then,

01:50:16,263 --> 01:50:19,016
Get out.
Get up here.

1859
01:50:19,142 --> 01:50:20,434
Cady, listen to me.
This is between

1860
01:50:20,519 --> 01:50:22,061
you and me.
Leave them out of it.

1861
01:50:22,437 --> 01:50:25,899
This is my night, Counselor.
Don't you step on my lines.

1862
01:50:25,983 --> 01:50:28,568
No! Stop! Stop!

1863
01:50:31,031 --> 01:50:32,365
Yes, Leigh?

1864
01:50:33,033 --> 01:50:36,202
Listen to me, Max.
Listen to me.

1865
01:50:38,540 --> 01:50:41,792
You know, Max,
since all this started,

1866
01:50:41,876 --> 01:50:43,502
I've thought
about you all the time.

1867
01:50:43,878 --> 01:50:49,175
I've tried to imagine
what it must have
been like for you

1868
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:50,969
all those years,
locked up in jail.

1869
01:50:51,637 --> 01:50:56,684
I've tried
to imagine you
and even your crimes

1870
01:50:56,768 --> 01:51:00,188
and how you must have felt
in those moments
that you did them.

1871
01:51:01,315 --> 01:51:05,026
See, I know
about loss, Max.

1872
01:51:05,111 --> 01:51:09,740
I know about losing time,
even losing years.

1873
01:51:10,576 --> 01:51:13,995
And I know it
doesn't compare to jail,

1874
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:19,459
but I can understand
and I could
share this with you.

1875
01:51:20,128 --> 01:51:24,465
Because of that,
whatever it is
that you've got planned,

1876
01:51:25,259 --> 01:51:27,594
I want you to do
it just with me,

1877
01:51:29,139 --> 01:51:30,639
not with her,

1878
01:51:31,474 --> 01:51:36,271
because we have
this connection.

1879
01:51:48,118 --> 01:51:50,328
What do you think,
Counselor?

1880
01:51:52,081 --> 01:51:53,123
No!

1881
01:51:55,627 --> 01:51:57,837
That was real eloquent,
Leigh.

1882
01:51:59,965 --> 01:52:01,341
Brave, too.

1883
01:52:01,842 --> 01:52:05,804
I wanna thank you
for conveying to me
your very powerful emotions

1884
01:52:06,848 --> 01:52:08,057
because

1885
01:52:13,856 --> 01:52:16,274
I'm gonna enjoy this
all the more.

1893
01:53:33,488 --> 01:53:35,156
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

1894
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:36,574
Cady, somebody's
got to man the boat.

1895
01:53:36,658 --> 01:53:37,867
We're heading into
unprotected water.

1896

Do you swear?
I'll do it, Dad.

You sit, Danielle!
Don't you make light

I'm sorry,

That was argumentative.

1908

did prepare a prior

I can ask
leading questions,
Your Honor.

1912
01:54:08,779 --> 01:54:10,363
He is a hostile witness.

1913
01:54:10,447 --> 01:54:11,947
Would you care
to tell the court

1914
01:54:12,032 --> 01:54:13,866
what the gist was
of this report?

1915
01:54:13,950 --> 01:54:16,578
Cady, it was 14 years ago.
I can't remember that.

How can he answer
when you're hitting him
like that?

01:54:21,042 --> 01:54:22,627
Because he's
perjuring himself,

He knows damn well
exactly what it said.

1920
01:54:24,671 --> 01:54:25,713
Don't you?

1921
01:54:25,798 --> 01:54:27,590
It said that
she was promiscuous.

1922
01:54:27,674 --> 01:54:30,135
It said that she had
three different lovers
in one month.

1923
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:32,054
At least three!
At least three!

1924
01:54:32,138 --> 01:54:34,473
And did you show
this report to the D. A?

1925
01:54:34,724 --> 01:54:35,933
No, no!

1926
01:54:38,854 --> 01:54:42,107
I only discovered it
by chance when I started
representing myself

1927
01:54:42,191 --> 01:54:43,733
six years
into my sentence!

1928
01:54:43,818 --> 01:54:45,403
But there it was
in the court file.

1929
01:54:45,487 --> 01:54:47,947
But back in '77,
you buried it,
Counselor.

1930
01:54:48,031 --> 01:54:50,699
Would you care to
tell the jury why?

1931
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:54,830
Would you care to
tell the court why?

1932
01:54:57,166 --> 01:54:59,919
Because I know
he brutally raped her
and he beat her.

1933
01:55:00,003 --> 01:55:01,838
Talk to me!
I'm standing here!

1934
01:55:02,881 --> 01:55:04,424
Just because she
was promiscuous

1935
01:55:04,508 --> 01:55:05,968
didn't give you
the right to rape her!

1936
01:55:06,052 --> 01:55:08,178
You bragged to me
that you beat two prior

1937
01:55:08,263 --> 01:55:09,805
aggravated rapes.
You were a menace!

1938
01:55:09,889 --> 01:55:12,975
You were my lawyer!
You were my lawyer!

1939
01:55:13,059 --> 01:55:15,854
That report could
have saved me 14 years.

1940
01:55:15,938 --> 01:55:16,938
You're probably right.

I sentence you to

Fear, I suppose,
that to remember his name
