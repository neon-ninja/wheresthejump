1
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,653
It's highly toxic.

2
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,621
Come on, lads, keep it moving.

3
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:41,923
Keep it moving.

4
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,393
Go, go, go!

5
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,329
Is this double pay or what?

6
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,464
There is toxic waste.

7
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,673
What are you doing
sitting there, mate?

8
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,407
You're almost there.

9
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,577
I want this filth off my ship
as fast as possible.

10
00:04:22,897 --> 00:04:24,665
What you doing, then?

11
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,434
Naughty.

12
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,971
Help! Help!

13
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:32,073
Naughty.

14
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,608
Shh.

15
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,942
Keep your little beak shut.

16
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:36,376
Not very nice.

17
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,745
Otherwise,
you'll go for a swim.

18
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,081
Help! Help!

19
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,717
Help me! Help me!

20
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,385
-Hey.
-Ah. Well done.

21
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,721
I'm here from the home office.

22
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,022
Bullshit.

23
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,658
Here checking on,
uh, security protocols...

24
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,795
...and, um, taking
a few pictures, so smile.

25
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,031
What are you doing in here?

26
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:58,566
- Not very nice.
- What's going on?

27
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,739
That's him!

28
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:05,740
I'll get you!

29
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,583
Hey, hey!
Get at this!

30
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:33,935
- Get up.
- Get Him down!

31
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,673
You two, go left!
Cut him off!

32
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:40,641
I want him caught,
dead or dead.

33
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,047
Not there!
Go around! Go around!

34
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,952
There you go, mate.
End of the line.

35
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,888
Okay.

36
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,957
You're all under arrest.

37
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,525
- Huh?
- For the illegal dumping

38
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,993
of radioactive materials.

39
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:03,064
Yeah, you, you,
you, you and you.

40
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:06,100
What, me and...
and him, and him? And him?

41
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:09,971
-Kill him.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

42
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:13,107
I know.
You want to see the warrant.

43
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,675
It's right in my pocket.

44
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:17,712
I'll see you in court, yeah?

45
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:25,086
We're out of shipping lanes,

46
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,988
and you're 200 miles
from shore.

47
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:28,723
So enjoy your swim.

48
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,897
I've got him.
Just off the port side.

49
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,167
<i>He's like a green James Bond.</i>
<i>I like it.</i>

50
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,640
Oh, no, my hat!

51
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,009
Hello, suckers.

52
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:49,644
Looks like
he's been making friends.

53
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:52,079
Wherever he goes,
people just love him.

54
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:53,446
God knows why.

55
00:06:58,619 --> 00:06:59,687
Do you got this?

56
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:01,956
We'll see.

57
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,893
Maybe this wasn't
the best idea.

58
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:08,129
Maybe this isn't
the best idea.

59
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,497
This is gonna be
awesome.

60
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,766
Define "awesome."

61
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,134
I'm about to.

62
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:15,670
Opening hatch.

63
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,187
Next time, put a little
more air in this thing.

64
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,822
It's like breathing
through a straw.

65
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,524
Worked, didn't it?

66
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,059
You okay?

67
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:39,593
If you love your job,

68
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,128
you'll never work a day
in your life.

69
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,270
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>bring in Test 15.</i>

70
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,005
Initiating suit power-up.

71
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,073
Clear.

72
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,010
Promising.

73
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,683
The exo suit
is performing way beyond

74
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:03,851
what we expected, Jiuming.

75
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:09,724
21% increase in power.

76
00:08:11,726 --> 00:08:12,827
Not bad, huh?

77
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,894
So cool.

78
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,900
I can't wait to use these
in the trench.

79
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:24,705
Hi.

80
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:25,973
What's up favourite niece?

81
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,008
I'm supposed
to tell you not to be

82
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,542
late for the party tonight.

83
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,878
Of course.

84
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,316
- Maybe 25. Hmm?
- Okay.

85
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,718
I mean it,
don't be late!

86
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,929
I cannot believe
you got this far in life

87
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:50,865
without knowing
how to tie a tie.

88
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,768
First, let's not overstate
how far I've gotten in life.

89
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:57,138
Second, never involved wearing
a monkey suit.

90
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:58,873
-Perfect. You look great.
-Thanks.

91
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,275
Ah. Maybe this is the start
of something.

92
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,711
Don't count on it.

93
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:08,282
Hi.

94
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,955
That guy look familiar
to you?

95
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:15,856
No.

96
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,161
- I don't like him.
- You don't like anyone.

97
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:21,762
I like you.

98
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:23,297
That's 'cause I save
your life all the time...

99
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,732
I buy you beers
and I back you up

100
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,000
in bar fights.

101
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,902
It's 'cause
you're a special guy.

102
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,770
You're both special.

103
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:32,273
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

104
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:33,607
Thanks for the money.

105
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:34,942
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

106
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,644
<i>welcome to</i>
<i>the 10th anniversary</i>

107
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,279
<i>of the Oceanic Institute.</i>

108
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:40,114
<i>I'm Hilary Driscoll.</i>

109
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:43,084
<i>Thank you for coming tonight,</i>
<i>and for joining me</i>

110
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:46,687
<i>in funding</i>
<i>this incredible work.</i>

111
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,123
Stop. Don't fidget.

112
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,325
Why exactly do I have to be

113
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,094
up here anyway?

114
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:54,695
'Cause you're a team player.

115
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:56,931
Great.

116
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,401
<i>Please give a warm welcome</i>

117
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,770
<i>to the director</i>
<i>of the Institute...</i>

118
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,606
<i>...Zhang Jiuming.</i>

119
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:10,377
<i>Thank you, Hilary.</i>

120
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:17,985
As the great
poet Song Lian said...

121
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:21,122
"Man is limited
only by his imagination."

122
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:26,127
My father named me Jiuming,

123
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,929
which means ocean

124
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,397
or abyss.

125
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,869
My father and my sister

126
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,971
spent their lives
studying the ocean.

127
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,673
It wasn't until

128
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:41,742
they were both gone
that I began to wonder

129
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,411
what my purpose was.

130
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:46,380
But through Suyin's daughter
Meiying,

131
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,182
I saw that there was a future.

132
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,385
I merged
my father's research institute

133
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,654
with my company

134
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,690
to carry forward

135
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:59,793
the spirit of exploring
the unknown in their honor.

136
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,167
To mark
this tenth anniversary,

137
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,703
I want to introduce you all
to someone very special.

138
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:19,146
Her name is Haiqi.

139
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,448
She is the world's
only megalodon in captivity.

140
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:24,485
We found her injured as a pup.

141
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,253
Thanks to Haiqi, we've learned
a tremendous amount

142
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:27,821
about the megalodons

143
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:30,824
as well as the trench
where they live.

144
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,860
<i>Thanks</i>
<i>to the generous donations</i>

145
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,728
<i>from our supporters,</i>

146
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,997
<i>we have been able</i>
<i>to create the technology</i>

147
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,999
<i>to pass through</i>
<i>the thermocline,</i>

148
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,902
<i>a thermal layer</i>
<i>of freezing cold water</i>

149
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,805
<i>that separates Haiqi's world</i>
<i>from ours</i>

150
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:48,876
<i>and into a trench 6,000 meters</i>
<i>below sea level.</i>

151
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,978
<i>Thanks to you,</i>
<i>we have the ability</i>

152
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,947
<i>to go further</i>
<i>than ever before.</i>

153
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,951
Love the ocean
and protect the ocean.

154
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,018
Thank you

155
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:03,390
<i>And thank you. Zhang Jiuming.</i>

156
00:12:03,424 --> 00:12:05,326
<i>So, thank you all</i>

157
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:09,964
<i>for being part of protecting</i>
<i>this incredible ecosystem.</i>

158
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:12,366
Thank you for coming.

159
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:15,069
Do you think
there are more creatures

160
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:16,036
to be discovered down there?

161
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:18,205
There has to be.

162
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,773
<i>Who wants to get a selfie</i>

163
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,375
<i>with the man</i>

164
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,811
<i>who fought a megalodon</i>
<i>and lived to tell the tale?</i>

165
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,379
<i>We give you,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

166
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,248
<i>Jonas Taylor.</i>

167
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,183
<i>There he is! There he is.</i>

168
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,154
I know this was your idea.

169
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:36,290
I'm gonna kill you.

170
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,092
Smile and pretend you love it.

171
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,227
<i>Go on, give him a hug.</i>
<i>Give him a tickle.</i>

172
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,230
<i>Oh, he loves people.</i>

173
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,444
I wanna go
to Mana One with you.

174
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:58,946
I want to dive the trench.

175
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,081
No.

176
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,183
Sorry, Meiying.

177
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,386
Why not?

178
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:08,355
Mom was diving all the time
at my age.

179
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,324
Not to 25,000 feet.

180
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,561
Saying it's too dangerous?

181
00:13:13,595 --> 00:13:14,862
Too dangerous for you.

182
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,299
But not dangerous.

183
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:21,569
In psychology, they call
that "cognitive dissonance."

184
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:25,472
In the real world,
they call it "parenting."

185
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:27,074
You need to start
taking me seriously

186
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,309
as a scientist.

187
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:31,078
-You're 14.
-Exactly.

188
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,113
I know every system
on Mana One,

189
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,915
every dive protocol

190
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,551
and every animal
we've seen down there.

191
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,887
Hey, look.

192
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,221
You can come to Mana One.

193
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:43,924
To observe the dive.

194
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:46,860
And that's it.

195
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,164
Jiuming is swimming
with the meg.

196
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,567
Uncle.

197
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,603
Haiqi's vitals
are elevated.

198
00:13:55,637 --> 00:13:58,138
Be careful,
she's definitely aware of you.

199
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,410
<i>Why are you swimming</i>

200
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:04,878
<i>with the meg, Jiuming?</i>

201
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:07,081
<i>I'm conducting an experiment.</i>

202
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,982
Is the experiment
"Do I taste good?"

203
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:12,986
Uncle, are you crazy?

204
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,556
<i>It's okay.</i>

205
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:16,524
<i>I've been training Haiqi</i>
<i>since she was a pup.</i>

206
00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:19,326
A meg is not trainable,
Jiuming.

207
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,228
But if you wanna be eaten

208
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,665
in front of your niece,
go ahead.

209
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:26,066
Fifty bucks says
this is gonna end badly.

210
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,468
I'll take that action.

211
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:29,303
I am all in
for team shark.

212
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,972
What? You can't bet
on a shark, man.

213
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,240
That's bad karma.

214
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,275
Come on, guys, focus.
That's not cool.

215
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,144
Jiuming...

216
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,445
I'd like
to respectfully suggest

217
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,180
that this is truly
a terrible idea.

218
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:42,483
Megs and humanity
were never meant to mix.

219
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,387
<i>Haiqi and I</i>
<i>have a special bond.</i>

220
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,921
<i>Watch this.</i>

221
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:52,627
<i>One click to come.</i>
<i>Two clicks to go.</i>

222
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,560
Whoa.
I think she's looking at us.

223
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:36,203
<i>You see?</i>

224
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:39,473
She's coming around.
Heart rate is up.

225
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:41,509
Moving in fast.

226
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:47,314
<i>Four hundred meters.</i>

227
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:56,423
Slowly, slowly.

228
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,394
Jiuming,
she's not responding.

229
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,462
<i>Come on, Haiqi.</i>

230
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:02,496
Two hundred meters.

231
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,301
<i>One hundred meters.</i>

232
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,603
Jiuming, move.

233
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:10,505
It's too late.
She's coming in too fast.

234
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:12,072
<i>Fifty meters.</i>

235
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:14,542
Pull the cord.

236
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:16,109
<i>Twenty meters.</i>

237
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,512
<i>Jiuming,</i>
<i>get out of there!</i>

238
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:18,680
<i>Uncle, no!</i>

239
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:25,587
Did it get him?

240
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,387
I don't know.
I couldn't watch.

241
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:29,389
I don't see him.

242
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:32,627
I knew this was a bad idea.

243
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,667
Total success.

244
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:44,171
Uncle! Are you crazy?

245
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,372
It's all right,
I'm good.

246
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,074
Huh?

247
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,009
That was exciting, huh?

248
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,280
I can't figure out
what's wrong with her.

249
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,482
She's been acting strangely
all week.

250
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:58,151
You can clickety-click
all you want.

251
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,087
The problem is
that it's a meg.

252
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,388
And you're a snack.

253
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,056
Yeah.

254
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,159
For the record, you scared
the hell out of Meiying.

255
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,461
You're one to talk.

256
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,396
What were you doing
on that ship?

257
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,432
Actually, don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.

258
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:14,669
Well, the Institute's mandate

259
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:17,237
is to protect the oceans,
right?

260
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:20,608
We can't be a part
of any illegal activity.

261
00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:22,175
Oh, I abhor lawlessness.

262
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,745
Oh, good.

263
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:25,613
Especially the illegal dumping
of radioactive waste.

264
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,584
You're taking
bigger and bigger risks

265
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:30,852
each time you go out.

266
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:32,820
Well, I guess
we both know about that.

267
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:36,089
It's not the same.

268
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:37,391
With me,

269
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,192
there's a calculation
of risks.

270
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:42,830
Not that I see.

271
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:57,745
Do you miss your mom,
big fish?

272
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,717
Doctor Howard.

273
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,418
Are you ready for Mana One?

274
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:08,656
Yes, whenever you're ready?

275
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,125
These new suits will let us
travel anywhere and at
any depth underwater.

276
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,194
Say.

277
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:17,799
What?

278
00:18:17,832 --> 00:18:19,534
No worries, no worries.

279
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,576
Mom and Grandpa
talked about you all the time.

280
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:31,846
Nothing good I suppose.

281
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,881
Wanna guess?

282
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,419
See this scar?

283
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:42,590
When I was 11
my father was busy in the lab.

284
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:45,425
So I snuck out to swim with my
friends on the rocky shores...

285
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:48,328
and had to get nine stitches
as a result of it.

286
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,197
When I returned home my father
taught me a real lesson.

287
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,700
Grandpa?

288
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:54,569
Of course.

289
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:56,470
He was kind to you
because you're
his granddaughter,

290
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:59,507
but he was tough on me.

291
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,612
So after college,
I started a company.

292
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:08,181
I wanted to get away from him.

293
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:11,586
I hadn't had any contact
with your grandfather
for many years.

294
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:15,255
Then he asked your mum
to bring me this calligraphy.

295
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:17,925
"Dragon travelling
across the Four Seas."

296
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:20,795
I thought it was
a form of ridicule...

297
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:25,566
but I came to realize that
he wanted me to
find my own way.

298
00:19:28,803 --> 00:19:30,437
Like the dragon...

299
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,675
I hope you can find
your own fate.

300
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,710
<i>Ground crew,</i>
<i>we're approaching Mana One.</i>

301
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:37,979
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>Rigas. Good to have you back.</i>

302
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:39,781
<i>I missed you guys.</i>

303
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:40,380
<i>Are you ready</i>
<i>to do some diving?</i>

304
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:42,617
<i>You know it.</i>

305
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,414
<i>Morning, everyone.</i>

306
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:48,783
<i>Let's get this show</i>
<i>underwater.</i>

307
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:49,751
<i>Dive 1 and Dive 2,</i>

308
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:51,284
<i>descend to 25,000 feet.</i>

309
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:53,020
<i>We're exploring Area 19.</i>

310
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:55,355
<i>Collecting rock samples</i>
<i>and logging any new species.</i>

311
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,625
<i>Diving in T-minus 20 minutes.</i>

312
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:59,459
<i>All eyes open</i>

313
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:01,461
<i>for a straightforward</i>
<i>sweep and scan. The usual.</i>

314
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:03,531
Yeah.
There's no usual down there.

315
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,767
System's up.

316
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:08,903
What's with
all these toys you have

317
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:10,505
hanging around your console,
Lance?

318
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:13,841
They're not toys,
they're figurines.

319
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,376
<i>They are</i>
<i>definitely toys, Lance.</i>

320
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,444
Thank you.

321
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:25,653
<i>Ready for the drop,</i>
<i>guys?</i>

322
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:52,312
So, are you and Sal, like,
Comic-Con guys or what?

323
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,616
Uh, absolutely right. Yeah.

324
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,919
Do you, um, dress up?

325
00:21:57,952 --> 00:21:59,620
Uh, yeah.

326
00:21:59,654 --> 00:22:01,421
Don't get him started,
unless you want to see

327
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:02,757
a million photographs.

328
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,792
<i>Oh, yes, please.</i>

329
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:06,426
<i>Stay focused, guys.</i>

330
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:10,665
<i>Passing 17,000.</i>

331
00:22:10,698 --> 00:22:12,399
<i>Telemetry's good.</i>

332
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:18,139
It's a beautiful day
in the neighborhood.

333
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:25,378
Passing 18,000 feet.

334
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:27,782
All systems nominal.

335
00:22:27,815 --> 00:22:29,449
Looking good, team.

336
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:30,585
Let's pull up the grids
we're gonna map today.

337
00:22:30,618 --> 00:22:32,419
<i>Area 19.</i>

338
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:33,921
<i>When are we going to</i>
<i>look at something different?</i>

339
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:34,889
<i>You know,</i>
<i>there's like 100 more</i>

340
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:36,123
<i>sectors to explore.</i>

341
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:38,526
Jonas,
can you confirm O2 levels?

342
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,596
Consumption is 11%
over mission spec.

343
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:43,965
Guess Rigas is nervous.

344
00:22:43,998 --> 00:22:45,800
More like
you're a mouth breather.

345
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,434
He totally is.

346
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:48,569
Can feel the breeze
from over here.

347
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:49,904
Yeah.

348
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:52,874
Firstly, it's called
a deviated septum.

349
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:55,676
Second, I distinctly remember
deviating it

350
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,044
while saving
your ungrateful ass

351
00:22:57,078 --> 00:22:59,814
<i>from a 70-foot megalodon.</i>

352
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:03,050
Passing 20,000 feet.
Approaching the thermocline.

353
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:08,556
Checking O2 lines
and tank pressure.

354
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:09,924
<i>Well,</i>
<i>if there was a leak,</i>

355
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:11,058
<i>there would be</i>
<i>a fluctuation on the readings.</i>

356
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:12,960
<i>I'm not seeing anything here.</i>

357
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:14,729
<i>Check the pressure</i>
<i>on the auxiliary O2 tanks.</i>

358
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:16,697
<i>Okay, I'll check again.</i>

359
00:23:16,731 --> 00:23:18,966
That's not the problem.

360
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,668
Uh, Jonas?

361
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,705
Meiying?

362
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:25,940
What the hell are you doing?

363
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:27,008
You gotta be kidding me.

364
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,679
I see that you're angry.

365
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:33,714
But I believe
that this is a reasonable

366
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:35,116
and responsible decision.

367
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:36,217
Stop the dive.

368
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:39,720
Full stop.

369
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:42,723
But before you start yelling,
can I just say...

370
00:23:42,757 --> 00:23:44,091
I did all kinds
of stupid things

371
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,893
when I was 14.

372
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:47,762
And look how I turned out.

373
00:23:47,795 --> 00:23:49,163
We're surfacing.

374
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:50,798
But I don't see
what the problem is.

375
00:23:50,831 --> 00:23:53,134
This is your 26th trench dive
without incident.

376
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:55,036
Subs have electric
predator countermeasures,

377
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:56,570
and emergency dive suits.

378
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:57,872
Which you don't have.

379
00:23:57,905 --> 00:23:58,873
Actually...

380
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:03,110
I packed one while you were
doing the pre-dive meeting.

381
00:24:03,144 --> 00:24:04,578
You know,

382
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:06,180
now's maybe
a good time to, uh,

383
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:09,784
sit down
and be quiet for a minute.

384
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:11,252
I can do a seatbelt by myself,
you know.

385
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:12,586
I know you can.

386
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,621
<i>Jonas.</i>

387
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:15,957
It's not your call, Jiuming.

388
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,124
We've got company.

389
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:20,194
Guys, it's a meg.

390
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:21,629
<i>Approaching fast.</i>

391
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:22,897
That's not possible.

392
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,598
they can't go through
the thermocline.

393
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:25,833
It's not come
from the thermocline.

394
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:27,068
I'm tracking it
from the shore.

395
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:30,905
Dive! Flank speed!

396
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:33,975
Engaging.
Rerouting battery array.

397
00:24:34,008 --> 00:24:35,042
<i>Hold on.</i>

398
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:38,980
Charging
the predator countermeasures.

399
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:41,115
We'll be dead
before they're online.

400
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:43,217
Thermocline's our only hope.

401
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,852
I'm reading Haiqi's tracker.

402
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,589
Impossible.

403
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:50,091
<i>Well,</i>
<i>impossible just got possible.</i>

404
00:24:50,124 --> 00:24:51,792
Five hundred meters
to the thermocline.

405
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:53,761
<i>Haiqi's closing fast.</i>

406
00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:54,962
<i>One hundred meters.</i>

407
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:55,997
She's right above us.

408
00:24:58,132 --> 00:24:59,834
Come on, come on!

409
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:01,802
<i>Entering the thermocline.</i>

410
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:03,137
Dive 1, Dive 2.

411
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,839
<i>Switch to low-frequency light.</i>

412
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:06,307
<i>you don't want to attract</i>
<i>any more megs.</i>

413
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,641
<i>I've lost her.</i>

414
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:08,976
<i>She can't follow us through.</i>

415
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,277
<i>Can she?</i>

416
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:12,079
<i>Going dark.</i>

417
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:14,081
<i>I've never crossed</i>
<i>the thermocline at 60 knots.</i>

418
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,753
<i>Careful. You don't want</i>
<i>to burn out the engines.</i>

419
00:25:18,786 --> 00:25:21,222
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
break the pretty toys.

420
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:31,465
Yes.

421
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:36,804
She's still on us.

422
00:25:36,837 --> 00:25:37,972
<i>Thirty seconds</i>

423
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:40,174
-for the countermeasures.
-Evasive.

424
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:41,609
She must have followed
our heat signature.

425
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:02,763
<i>How did your pet shark</i>

426
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:04,098
<i>get down here, Jiuming?</i>

427
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:05,766
She must have escaped.

428
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,635
How did that happen?

429
00:26:07,668 --> 00:26:09,003
<i>Predator countermeasures</i>
<i>active.</i>

430
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:12,139
Proximity alert.

431
00:26:12,173 --> 00:26:13,240
Megs.

432
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,179
No way.

433
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:32,059
That's the biggest meg
I've ever seen.

434
00:26:32,093 --> 00:26:34,895
Biggest meg
anyone's ever seen.

435
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:36,730
That's gotta be
the apex predator.

436
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:43,737
<i>Incredible. Megs are solitary.</i>

437
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:45,139
It's like
they're being called.

438
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:48,742
I'm changing the dive plan.

439
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:50,311
We have to see
what they're up to.

440
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:52,246
And what about Meiying?

441
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,747
Well, I vote we go.

442
00:26:54,682 --> 00:26:56,851
I wasn't asking you.

443
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:58,853
<i>Oxygen</i>
<i>reserves are at maximum.</i>

444
00:26:58,886 --> 00:27:01,722
Predator countermeasures
are deployed.

445
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:03,757
Right now
we are perfectly safe.

446
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:06,427
Right now, yeah.

447
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,296
If I see anything dangerous,
I'm pulling the plug.

448
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,664
<i>Mac, we're changing</i>

449
00:27:10,698 --> 00:27:11,899
<i>the mission profile.</i>

450
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:14,201
<i>Proceeding on heading 227.</i>

451
00:27:14,235 --> 00:27:15,402
Now, they're already
off mission.

452
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:16,871
They need to stay on course.

453
00:27:16,904 --> 00:27:18,139
Jonas,
you're going way outside

454
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:20,007
the sector we have
already mapped.

455
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,308
<i>This is</i>
<i>an exploration mission.</i>

456
00:27:21,342 --> 00:27:22,843
Let's explore.

457
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:25,045
Copy that.

458
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,113
Eyes open, watch your backs.

459
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:27,681
Really, Mac?

460
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:29,817
So, we're gonna follow
some giant sharks

461
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,886
to a unknown sector?

462
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,921
Man...

463
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:36,056
This some dumbass shit,
mark my words.

464
00:27:40,461 --> 00:27:42,863
<i>Entering sector 21.</i>

465
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,982
<i>Commencing geographical scan.</i>

466
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:04,785
It's so beautiful.

467
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:09,223
Your mum loved this place
more than anything.

468
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,426
I'm glad
I finally get to see it.

469
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:16,730
Don't get used to it.

470
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:18,465
You're grounded
for the rest of your life.

471
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:21,735
I love you, too.

472
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,273
<i>Haiqi</i>
<i>400 meters ahead and holding.</i>

473
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:27,875
<i>Where are we going now?</i>

474
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:29,410
<i>Into the unknown.</i>

475
00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:32,246
<i>That's what we came for.</i>

476
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,048
I've got
Haiqi's tracker ahead.

477
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:35,816
Looks like she's circling.

478
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:49,196
Look up.

479
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,365
It's some
instinctual gathering.

480
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:52,866
Incredible.

481
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,504
They're here to mate.

482
00:28:56,538 --> 00:28:59,340
This is why Haiqi has been
acting strangely.

483
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:01,909
Oh, great.
More megs.

484
00:29:09,116 --> 00:29:10,818
The scanner's detecting
an abnormal structure.

485
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,327
No way.

486
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:22,062
<i>Is that a wreck?</i>

487
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:27,569
It's some kind of
sea floor station.

488
00:29:27,602 --> 00:29:29,270
What could they be
doing down here?

489
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,975
Rigas, run all spectrums.

490
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,045
No, that's no wreck.

491
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:40,381
I'm getting
heat signatures off it.

492
00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:42,016
<i>Just can't see what's inside.</i>

493
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:43,317
<i>Multiple airlocks,</i>

494
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,586
<i>power generation.</i>

495
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:47,121
The resources needed
is staggering.

496
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:51,458
Who would even have
that technology?

497
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:55,162
Sonar says
there's something above us.

498
00:29:55,195 --> 00:29:57,264
It looks like a submarine.

499
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:59,033
Let's take a look.

500
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:00,200
<i>Charges set.</i>

501
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:01,969
<i>Priming zone for detonation.</i>

502
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:04,405
Come on.
We need to blow this ridge.

503
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:06,340
<i>Yeah, okay, okay.</i>

504
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,275
<i>We don't wanna be down here</i>
<i>any longer than needs be.</i>

505
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:12,880
<i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>this is the only place</i>

506
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:14,281
<i>to mine this stuff.</i>

507
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:17,918
Slow and steady.

508
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:19,353
<i>Hey, Montes.</i>

509
00:30:19,386 --> 00:30:20,387
<i>Why do you get to stay</i>
<i>in the submarine?</i>

510
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:24,291
<i>It's good</i>
<i>to be the king.</i>

511
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:26,093
<i>Incoming object detected.</i>

512
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:30,397
Zoom in 400%.

513
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:44,078
<i>Mana One crew is below us.</i>

514
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:46,947
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>they haven't seen the station.</i>

515
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,516
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

516
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,984
<i>I'm arming</i>
<i>the explosives right now.</i>

517
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:52,319
<i>You have to get out.</i>

518
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:54,254
<i>What? Wait, no,</i>
<i>you can't do that.</i>

519
00:30:54,288 --> 00:30:56,123
<i>There isn't time.</i>
<i>You know there isn't time.</i>

520
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:57,891
<i>It will take ten minutes</i>
<i>to get clear.</i>

521
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:00,127
<i>Montes!</i>

522
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:08,570
Sorry, guys.

523
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:10,237
<i>Montes!</i>
<i>Montes, don't do it!</i>

524
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:15,109
<i>What was that?</i>

525
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:19,146
Landslide!

526
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:21,215
I can't get ahead of it.
I'm gonna have to go through.

527
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,117
<i>Guys?</i>
<i>What's happening?</i>

528
00:31:57,151 --> 00:31:58,720
I'm reading
a thermocline breach.

529
00:31:58,753 --> 00:32:01,054
Something's ripped
a giant hole in it.

530
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:14,301
Rerouting the thrusters.
This is all we've got.

531
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,543
Vertical control is down.

532
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:23,778
Hydraulics are non-responsive.

533
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:28,683
We're pinned.

534
00:32:30,652 --> 00:32:31,653
Coming in.

535
00:32:34,054 --> 00:32:35,590
- <i>Hold us steady.</i>
- Yeah.

536
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:41,462
<i>Jiuming.</i>
<i>Sixty degrees down.</i>

537
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:43,030
Two feet forward.

538
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:47,535
Jiuming!

539
00:32:56,778 --> 00:32:57,978
Go, go, go!

540
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,615
Full thrust! Full thrust!

541
00:33:12,426 --> 00:33:13,360
Jiuming!

542
00:33:14,796 --> 00:33:15,663
No!

543
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:28,375
There's no telemetry.

544
00:33:30,477 --> 00:33:33,146
Dive 1, Dive 2. Do you copy?

545
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:36,383
Dive 1, Dive 2. Do you copy?

546
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:40,755
We've got nothing here.

547
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:44,626
Keep trying, DJ. Jess,
prep the rescue sub. Stat.

548
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:46,728
-Ugh, what happened?
-I don't know.

549
00:33:48,763 --> 00:33:50,598
How do we know
if they're still alive?

550
00:33:50,632 --> 00:33:52,132
Prep the rescue vehicle.

551
00:33:54,702 --> 00:33:57,304
Dive 1, Dive 2.
Do you copy?

552
00:33:58,105 --> 00:33:59,273
Come on, Jonas.

553
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:03,176
Meiying.

554
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,413
Meiying.

555
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:09,216
Meiying.

556
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:10,652
What happened?

557
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:11,786
Took a nasty hit.

558
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:15,088
Uncle Jiuming?

559
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,525
Where's Uncle Jiuming?

560
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:20,160
-Where is he?
-We can't raise him.

561
00:34:20,193 --> 00:34:22,797
Hey. We work the problems
one by one.

562
00:34:24,131 --> 00:34:25,198
We do what's in front of us...

563
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:27,467
...and then we do
the next thing.

564
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,203
We're gonna be okay.

565
00:34:31,606 --> 00:34:33,273
Mac!

566
00:34:33,307 --> 00:34:35,510
The rescue sub isn't working.

567
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:37,845
<i>The battery array</i>
<i>was deliberately shorted out.</i>

568
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,313
<i>It looks like sabotage.</i>

569
00:34:39,346 --> 00:34:40,380
How's that possible?

570
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:41,716
<i>This isn't a secure area.</i>

571
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:43,183
<i>There are 30 people</i>
<i>who work here.</i>

572
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:44,752
Well, how long to fix it?

573
00:34:44,786 --> 00:34:47,321
It's the control boards, Mac.
There is no fixing it.

574
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:52,225
Try it now.

575
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:53,460
What's our status?

576
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:54,529
No comms, no heat.

577
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,431
We're losing air fast.

578
00:34:57,464 --> 00:34:58,566
This isn't working.

579
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,100
Flood in my extra O2.

580
00:35:01,536 --> 00:35:02,670
Already done.

581
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:04,906
I've got one last idea.

582
00:35:04,939 --> 00:35:06,908
Route the power
through the heating cell.

583
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:15,449
I got Dive 1.
Mac, I got Dive 1.

584
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:17,585
Jonas?

585
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:19,286
Good to hear your voice, Mac.

586
00:35:19,319 --> 00:35:21,488
<i>Not as good as it is</i>
<i>to hear yours, brother.</i>

587
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:22,890
<i>Talk to me.</i>

588
00:35:22,924 --> 00:35:24,826
It ain't good.

589
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:27,562
<i>Almost every system is down,</i>
<i>and we're losing air fast.</i>

590
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:30,497
We'll get into
the emergency dive suits...

591
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:31,766
and we're gonna need
a ride up.

592
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:34,301
Jonas...

593
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,537
it's not gonna be possible.

594
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:39,439
What are you talking about?

595
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:41,341
<i>The battery array.</i>
<i>It shorted out</i>

596
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,310
<i>the control board</i>
<i>in the rescue sub.</i>

597
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:44,712
<i>We're investigating it now.</i>

598
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:49,216
Jonas?

599
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:51,586
Jonas, can you hear me?

600
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:54,856
<i>Jonas, we can't get to you.</i>

601
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,794
We're gonna walk.

602
00:36:01,763 --> 00:36:03,330
We're gonna walk back
across the trench.

603
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:05,399
Make it into
that sea floor station.

604
00:36:05,432 --> 00:36:06,834
<i>And we're gonna get inside.</i>

605
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:08,736
<i>And then we're gonna get</i>
<i>to the surface.</i>

606
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,338
Those suits have
two hours of air tops.

607
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:13,741
They're only designed
for brief extravehicular work.

608
00:36:13,775 --> 00:36:16,276
We'll go slow and steady.
They'll hold.

609
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:17,979
It's three kilometers.

610
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:19,914
You'll be defenseless
out there.

611
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:21,783
What do you want from me, Mac?

612
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:24,484
This is what we got, and this
is what we're gonna do.

613
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:28,556
Half our team is dead,

614
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:30,290
and I'm not losing
the other half.

615
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,733
<i>Beginning suit initialization.</i>

616
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,768
<i>Joint actuators functioning.</i>

617
00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:44,337
<i>Ultrasonic signal</i>
<i>communications online.</i>

618
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:46,206
<i>Initialization complete.</i>

619
00:36:49,043 --> 00:36:51,612
Abandoning Dive 1, Mac.

620
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,981
The radios won't relay
to the surface,

621
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:55,650
so we're going dark.

622
00:36:55,683 --> 00:36:57,685
<i>Talk to you on the other side.</i>

623
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:58,953
Godspeed, Jonas.

624
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,662
<i>Emergency escape initiated.</i>

625
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:54,407
<i>Hey. Whoa!</i>

626
00:37:55,877 --> 00:37:56,944
<i>Almost killed you.</i>

627
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,080
<i>The hell are you doing?</i>

628
00:37:59,113 --> 00:38:00,882
<i>Saving your ass.</i>

629
00:38:00,915 --> 00:38:02,650
<i>And walking back</i>
<i>to that station.</i>

630
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,987
<i>What are you doing?</i>

631
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,722
<i>Saving your ass.</i>

632
00:38:07,755 --> 00:38:10,057
<i>And walking back</i>
<i>to that station.</i>

633
00:38:10,091 --> 00:38:11,726
<i>-Don't have much time.</i>
<i>-Let's get going.</i>

634
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:15,763
<i>-Jiu.</i>
<i>-Oh.</i>

635
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,499
Uncle, I thought you --

636
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:21,401
You're not going
to get rid of me that easily.

637
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:24,539
<i>Hey.</i>

638
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:26,574
<i>Hey. Let me check.</i>

639
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:27,642
<i>Air left...</i>

640
00:38:27,675 --> 00:38:29,110
<i>Hey, you need to calm down</i>

641
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:30,711
<i>or you're gonna</i>
<i>run out of oxygen, Lance.</i>

642
00:38:30,745 --> 00:38:32,547
<i>I don't think i can.</i>

643
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,347
<i>Think of it as cosplay.</i>

644
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:37,685
<i>Or we could</i>
<i>be paintballing.</i>

645
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:39,554
<i>Like the ultimate</i>
<i>team-building exercise.</i>

646
00:38:39,587 --> 00:38:40,888
<i>We need</i>
<i>to cover distance</i>

647
00:38:40,922 --> 00:38:42,757
<i>while the megs</i>
<i>are still occupied.</i>

648
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,424
<i>Three</i>
<i>kilometers to destination.</i>

649
00:38:44,457 --> 00:38:46,127
<i>Away from the megs</i>
<i>is fine by me.</i>

650
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,895
<i>We're a strong group.</i>

651
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:49,096
<i>We can do this.</i>

652
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:53,568
<i>Amazing.</i>

653
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:56,537
<i>Lighting courtesy</i>
<i>of Mother Nature.</i>

654
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:57,905
<i>It's incredible,</i>

655
00:38:57,939 --> 00:39:00,007
<i>there are new species</i>
<i>all around us.</i>

656
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,442
<i>Hey. Look.</i>

657
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,111
<i>Look at this.</i>
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

658
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:09,984
<i>Hello,</i>
<i>my little biolum--</i>

659
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:14,021
<i>There's a snake!</i>
<i>There's a snake!</i>

660
00:39:14,055 --> 00:39:16,023
<i>Get this monster off my head!</i>

661
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:22,730
<i>No touching stuff.</i>

662
00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:24,765
<i>He started it.</i>

663
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:28,636
Everyone
clear the station.

664
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:30,137
DJ, what's our time on Jonas?

665
00:39:30,171 --> 00:39:32,006
Forty-one minutes
since they went dark.

666
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,507
At best,
it'll take another hour

667
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:34,642
for them
to cover the distance.

668
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:36,510
Listen up.

669
00:39:36,544 --> 00:39:38,546
We know there's some kind of
rogue operation in the trench.

670
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:39,714
Now, some bastard's
got his fingers

671
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:41,115
in our operation here.

672
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:43,150
That sub was
definitely sabotaged,

673
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:44,819
so we've got a mole
on the station.

674
00:39:44,852 --> 00:39:47,154
DJ, I want you to pull
all surveillance footage

675
00:39:47,188 --> 00:39:49,489
from the sub bay
for the last 24 hours.

676
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:51,659
Jess, run the personnel files
on the crew,

677
00:39:51,692 --> 00:39:53,661
look for anything suspect.

678
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:54,929
We're gonna get
these sons of bitches,

679
00:39:54,962 --> 00:39:56,731
but we have to watch
our own backs.

680
00:39:56,764 --> 00:39:59,734
One of us mans the DCC
at all times, understood?

681
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:00,768
Yes.

682
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:07,440
<i>Is it just me,</i>

683
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:09,510
<i>or does walking</i>
<i>three kilometers underwater</i>

684
00:40:09,543 --> 00:40:11,112
<i>sound like hard work?</i>

685
00:40:11,145 --> 00:40:13,147
<i>It certainly wasn't</i>
<i>on my to-do list.</i>

686
00:40:16,717 --> 00:40:19,153
<i>Baby octopi.</i>

687
00:40:19,186 --> 00:40:21,488
<i>So many colors.</i>
<i>That's incredible.</i>

688
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,560
<i>Anybody wanna play</i>
<i>a game?</i>

689
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:27,628
<i>A game?</i>

690
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:29,096
<i>This isn't a game.</i>

691
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,699
<i>She means to keep</i>
<i>our minds occupied.</i>

692
00:40:31,732 --> 00:40:34,602
<i>Right now, my mind is</i>
<i>pretty damn occupied.</i>

693
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:58,059
<i>- There's a... there's a...</i>
<i>- It's...</i>

694
00:40:58,693 --> 00:40:59,827
<i>Lance?</i>

695
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,595
<i>What was it?</i>

696
00:41:01,629 --> 00:41:03,597
- <i>I didn't see.</i>
<i>- Where's Lance?</i>

697
00:41:03,631 --> 00:41:04,865
<i>Is it a meg?</i>

698
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:09,537
<i>Some... something's</i>
<i>happened to him. I know it.</i>

699
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,638
<i>Lance?</i>

700
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:17,178
<i>No. Oh, no.</i>

701
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:18,879
<i>We have to keep moving.</i>

702
00:41:18,913 --> 00:41:20,681
<i>No, we... We can't just</i>
<i>leave him out there.</i>

703
00:41:20,715 --> 00:41:22,016
<i>We need to find him!</i>

704
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:23,551
<i>Please, Jiuming.</i>

705
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:24,685
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

706
00:41:25,586 --> 00:41:26,520
<i>He's gone.</i>

707
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:31,993
<i>Rigas, cover our six.</i>
<i>Shoot anything that moves.</i>

708
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:36,030
<i>You bet your ass I will.</i>

709
00:41:52,613 --> 00:41:54,548
<i>Comms online.</i>

710
00:41:57,118 --> 00:41:59,587
<i>What happened to you?</i>

711
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,189
<i>The Mana One crew</i>
<i>stumbled upon our station.</i>

712
00:42:02,223 --> 00:42:04,091
I took them out
with a landslide.

713
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:06,761
<i>Okay, this is...</i>
<i>this is out of control.</i>

714
00:42:06,794 --> 00:42:08,329
You authorized me

715
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:11,332
to do whatever's necessary
to protect our operation.

716
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:13,034
No.

717
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:15,269
They're not dead.

718
00:42:15,302 --> 00:42:19,607
They are walking right now
to the station.

719
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,808
If they get there,

720
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:23,277
<i>we are screwed.</i>

721
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,248
<i>There's still</i>
<i>a kilometer to go,</i>

722
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:28,716
<i>straight through</i>
<i>that valley,</i>

723
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:30,084
<i>and we don't have</i>

724
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:32,019
<i>the bioluminescence</i>
<i>to cover us.</i>

725
00:42:32,053 --> 00:42:33,254
<i>We're going to be</i>
<i>totally exposed out there.</i>

726
00:42:33,287 --> 00:42:34,955
<i>We don't have a choice.</i>

727
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:37,291
<i>We only have enough air</i>
<i>to go straight through.</i>

728
00:42:37,324 --> 00:42:41,162
<i>Let's keep</i>
<i>our lights on low spectrum.</i>

729
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:43,097
<i>Yeah. We don't want</i>
<i>to attract the megs.</i>

730
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,900
<i>One kilometer to destination.</i>

731
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:47,601
<i>O2 check?</i>

732
00:42:47,635 --> 00:42:49,070
<i>65%.</i>

733
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:50,137
<i>50.</i>

734
00:42:50,171 --> 00:42:52,306
<i>26%.</i>

735
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:53,941
<i>It's not gonna be enough.</i>

736
00:42:53,974 --> 00:42:55,609
<i>Hey, look at me.</i>
<i>Look at me.</i>

737
00:42:55,643 --> 00:42:57,845
<i>Look at me, okay? Focus, okay?</i>

738
00:42:57,878 --> 00:43:00,314
<i>You can do this.</i>
<i>Remember the training.</i>

739
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:03,784
<i>Anything on sonar?</i>

740
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:06,053
<i>I got something,</i>
<i>right at the edge of my range.</i>

741
00:43:07,054 --> 00:43:08,856
<i>Keeps going in and out.</i>

742
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:13,127
<i>Stalking us.</i>

743
00:43:21,936 --> 00:43:23,204
<i>Proximity alert.</i>

744
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:26,307
<i>What is it?</i>

745
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:33,414
<i>It's just</i>
<i>a shoal of fish.</i>

746
00:43:35,182 --> 00:43:36,784
<i>Stay calm, everyone.</i>

747
00:43:36,817 --> 00:43:38,385
<i>- </i> <i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

748
00:43:38,419 --> 00:43:39,687
<i>Keep moving.</i>

749
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:43,791
Ayo, Mac.

750
00:43:43,824 --> 00:43:45,259
We got jack
on the security footage.

751
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:46,427
Somebody deleted it.

752
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,695
For the sub bay?

753
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:49,663
For the whole damn station.

754
00:43:49,697 --> 00:43:51,265
They're good, but they don't
know everything.

755
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:53,400
There's a satellite uplink
with an encrypted backup.

756
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:54,935
I'm gonna go
to the server room,

757
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:56,237
see if I can pull it down.

758
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,838
Time?

759
00:43:57,872 --> 00:43:59,173
One hour, 50.
They'll be out of air soon.

760
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:01,242
I'm scanning all channels,
but nothing yet.

761
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,250
<i>That's it.</i>
<i>Maybe 400 meters.</i>

762
00:44:14,855 --> 00:44:15,890
<i>Warning.</i>

763
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:17,291
<i>Entering oxygen reserves.</i>

764
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:19,160
<i>You can do this.</i>

765
00:44:19,193 --> 00:44:21,162
<i>- Yeah?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

766
00:44:21,195 --> 00:44:22,963
<i>I'm getting</i>
<i>a reading.</i>

767
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:24,698
<i>Many contacts to our right.</i>

768
00:44:25,966 --> 00:44:27,034
<i>Coming in fast.</i>

769
00:44:30,004 --> 00:44:31,739
<i>What, megs?</i>

770
00:44:31,772 --> 00:44:34,975
<i>No. Smaller. Faster.</i>

771
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:40,481
<i>Everybody make it</i>
<i>to the station!</i>

772
00:44:40,515 --> 00:44:42,249
<i>- Go, move!</i>
<i>- Warning.</i>

773
00:44:42,283 --> 00:44:43,951
<i>- Oxygen level low.</i>
<i>- </i> <i>Come on.</i>

774
00:44:43,984 --> 00:44:44,185
- <i>Come on.</i>
<i>- </i> <i>I'm out of air.</i>

775
00:44:45,953 --> 00:44:47,321
<i>They're coming</i>
<i>over the ridge!</i>

776
00:44:51,526 --> 00:44:52,960
<i>What are those things?</i>

777
00:44:52,993 --> 00:44:54,328
<i>It's too far.</i>

778
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:56,397
<i>We need</i>
<i>to make a stand!</i>

779
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,731
<i>Turn and fight!</i>

780
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:12,880
<i>Come on!</i>

781
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:18,052
<i>Meiying!</i>

782
00:45:18,085 --> 00:45:19,820
<i>Help!</i>
<i>Shoot their head!</i>

783
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:21,055
<i>-Meiying!</i>
<i>-Uncle!</i>

784
00:45:23,991 --> 00:45:25,359
<i>I've got you!</i>

785
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:27,361
Hold on!

786
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:27,861
<i>They're biting</i>
<i>through the suit.</i>

787
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:32,399
<i>Meiying!</i>

788
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:43,511
<i>No. No.</i>

789
00:45:43,545 --> 00:45:45,145
<i>Hold on, Curtis!</i>

790
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:47,147
<i>Too many!</i>
<i>We don't have a chance!</i>

791
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,201
<i>Everybody stay back!</i>

792
00:46:09,103 --> 00:46:10,271
<i>Keep going!</i>

793
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:19,179
<i>Jiuming!</i>

794
00:46:19,213 --> 00:46:20,414
<i>There's no choice.</i>

795
00:46:22,016 --> 00:46:23,484
<i>You really want to die,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

796
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:50,244
<i>Gotta make it</i>
<i>to the airlock!</i>

797
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,892
<i>Warning. Low air.</i>

798
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:06,193
<i>It's no use</i>

799
00:47:06,226 --> 00:47:07,061
<i>-I'm holding you back.</i>
<i>-Low air.</i>

800
00:47:10,898 --> 00:47:12,466
<i>It's not too far.</i>

801
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:14,101
<i>You can make it!</i>

802
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:15,637
<i>Warning. Low air.</i>

803
00:47:18,138 --> 00:47:19,574
<i>Warning. Low air.</i>

804
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:22,910
<i>Air depleted.</i>

805
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:34,622
<i>Uncle!</i>

806
00:47:34,656 --> 00:47:36,390
<i>Visor failure imminent.</i>

807
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:39,059
<i>Jiuming!</i>

808
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:48,268
<i>Okay. We gotta go.</i>
<i>We don't have a choice.</i>

809
00:47:48,302 --> 00:47:49,937
<i>He's coming</i>
<i>back around!</i>

810
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,539
- <i>Oh, God!</i>
<i>- Go, go, go!</i>

811
00:47:54,408 --> 00:47:55,643
<i>We have to do the override.</i>

812
00:47:58,345 --> 00:48:00,047
<i>Come on, hurry up.</i>

813
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,684
<i>Rigas, come on!</i>

814
00:48:02,717 --> 00:48:04,051
<i>You can do it.</i>
<i>Get in!</i>

815
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:09,056
<i>Shut the door!</i>

816
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:10,457
<i>Curtis, you'll be okay.</i>

817
00:48:10,491 --> 00:48:12,459
<i>Suit implosion imminent.</i>

818
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:13,060
<i>- Almost there. Almost there!</i>
<i>- </i> <i>Oh, my God.</i>

819
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:17,264
<i>It's gonna implode.</i>

820
00:48:17,297 --> 00:48:18,566
<i>Depressurize the room!</i>

821
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,367
<i>No, no, no.</i>

822
00:48:20,401 --> 00:48:22,002
<i>No!</i>

823
00:49:04,144 --> 00:49:06,146
Son of a bitch!

824
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,481
I hate these things!

825
00:49:09,183 --> 00:49:11,084
Hey, Rigas.

826
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:12,687
Let's try to keep it together.

827
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:15,989
We ain't out of the woods yet.

828
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:45,118
Rigas.

829
00:49:57,264 --> 00:49:58,666
Where is everybody?

830
00:50:14,682 --> 00:50:16,183
What is that smell?

831
00:50:17,785 --> 00:50:19,086
Divers.

832
00:50:27,629 --> 00:50:28,696
Nobody home.

833
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,365
I'll cover the door.

834
00:50:37,672 --> 00:50:41,676
Whoever's running this
is not our friend.

835
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:43,143
We need to contact
Mana One ASAP.

836
00:50:43,176 --> 00:50:44,378
Think you can handle it?

837
00:50:44,411 --> 00:50:45,647
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

838
00:50:49,316 --> 00:50:51,351
What is this
that they're mining?

839
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:53,220
Whatever it is,
they're sending it

840
00:50:53,253 --> 00:50:55,222
up to the surface
with these pods.

841
00:51:01,663 --> 00:51:04,599
Mmm. Rare earth metals.

842
00:51:04,632 --> 00:51:06,266
They're used
in superconductors,

843
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,136
aerospace
and quantum computing.

844
00:51:09,169 --> 00:51:12,472
This box alone
could be a billion dollars.

845
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:15,475
"Billion" with a "B?"

846
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:16,544
Yes.

847
00:51:16,578 --> 00:51:17,612
Mana One.

848
00:51:17,645 --> 00:51:19,346
Jonas. Comms are live.

849
00:51:24,184 --> 00:51:25,452
<i>Come in.</i>

850
00:51:25,485 --> 00:51:27,287
<i>It's Jonas. Getting this?</i>

851
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:28,523
Hey, you're alive.

852
00:51:28,556 --> 00:51:30,792
What's your status?

853
00:51:30,825 --> 00:51:33,293
We lost Lance,
Sal, and Curtis.

854
00:51:34,562 --> 00:51:35,830
We're at the station.

855
00:51:35,863 --> 00:51:38,533
It's a rogue mining operation.

856
00:51:38,566 --> 00:51:39,867
<i>Is there anyone down there?</i>

857
00:51:39,901 --> 00:51:41,769
Not that we've seen so far.

858
00:51:41,803 --> 00:51:43,337
<i>They've infiltrated Mana One.</i>

859
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:45,372
<i>The rescue sub was sabotaged.</i>

860
00:51:45,405 --> 00:51:47,542
-By who?
<i>-We're working on it.</i>

861
00:51:47,575 --> 00:51:48,610
<i>But check this out.</i>

862
00:51:48,643 --> 00:51:50,344
<i>I was going over the video</i>

863
00:51:50,377 --> 00:51:52,614
<i>of when you went</i>
<i>over that station before.</i>

864
00:51:52,647 --> 00:51:54,114
<i>Look at the north side.</i>

865
00:51:56,751 --> 00:51:59,486
Looks like
emergency escape pods.

866
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,789
It's the opposite
side from where we are.

867
00:52:17,572 --> 00:52:19,272
Feels dead in here.

868
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:20,374
Stay close.

869
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:24,846
These are my designs.

870
00:52:25,947 --> 00:52:27,314
How do they have this?

871
00:52:39,694 --> 00:52:41,161
Looks like this is it.

872
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:53,473
On three.

873
00:52:53,508 --> 00:52:54,909
Three.

874
00:52:59,446 --> 00:53:00,648
- Again.
- It's not gonna work.

875
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:13,360
After you.

876
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:18,833
Ah,
this is more like it.

877
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:20,868
Let's crack open a pod
and get out of here.

878
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,972
Nothing here.

879
00:53:25,006 --> 00:53:26,874
These controls ain't working.

880
00:53:26,908 --> 00:53:28,341
We need to close the hatch.

881
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:29,476
On it.

882
00:53:33,915 --> 00:53:36,316
Guys, that wasn't me.

883
00:53:38,418 --> 00:53:40,888
<i>Jonas,</i>
<i>now that I have you here,</i>

884
00:53:40,922 --> 00:53:42,489
<i>we need to talk candidly.</i>

885
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:44,025
<i>I have full control</i>
<i>of the station,</i>

886
00:53:44,058 --> 00:53:45,693
<i>and I've locked down</i>
<i>this room.</i>

887
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:46,861
Jess?

888
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:48,596
<i>Your life is in my hands.</i>

889
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:49,797
What are you doing, Jess?

890
00:53:52,332 --> 00:53:54,669
These are your friends.

891
00:53:54,702 --> 00:53:56,369
They've been with you
for years.

892
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:57,839
<i>I know it hurts.</i>

893
00:53:57,872 --> 00:53:59,439
<i>And we're talking</i>
<i>because I'd prefer</i>

894
00:53:59,473 --> 00:54:01,341
<i>we were on the same side.</i>

895
00:54:01,374 --> 00:54:03,511
<i>All making so much money,</i>
<i>it ceases to have meaning.</i>

896
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:04,879
You're offering us money?

897
00:54:07,582 --> 00:54:09,817
Three of our friends are dead
because of you.

898
00:54:09,851 --> 00:54:11,753
You think
I'm gonna forget about that?

899
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:17,992
No, no, no, no, no!
That's the first escape pod!

900
00:54:18,025 --> 00:54:19,560
Son of a bitch!

901
00:54:19,594 --> 00:54:23,698
<i>Rigas?</i>
<i>Rigas, you can save Meiying.</i>

902
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:26,601
<i>Take that speargun</i>
<i>and shoot Jonas in the heart.</i>

903
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:49,891
Don't shoot him.

904
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:03,771
Do it.

905
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:05,706
Go ahead.

906
00:55:07,942 --> 00:55:09,877
It's the only way
Meiying survives.

907
00:55:14,015 --> 00:55:15,315
Do it.

908
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:18,451
Rigas!

909
00:55:19,787 --> 00:55:21,522
Do it!

910
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:26,027
-Do it!
-No. I'm sorry.

911
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:29,797
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't.
I can't. I can't.

912
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:39,372
That was the last pod.

913
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:43,644
<i>I told you that wouldn't work.</i>

914
00:55:43,678 --> 00:55:44,745
Put me on.

915
00:55:47,582 --> 00:55:49,784
<i>Oh, sorry</i>
<i>it had to come to this.</i>

916
00:55:50,918 --> 00:55:52,419
<i>So...</i>

917
00:55:52,452 --> 00:55:53,921
we'll be back at work
in a week,

918
00:55:53,955 --> 00:55:57,892
using your technology
to take whatever we want.

919
00:55:57,925 --> 00:56:01,529
<i>Your institute'll be</i>
<i>a platform that we use</i>

920
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:04,866
to plunder the ocean
for decades.

921
00:56:04,899 --> 00:56:06,667
Karma will get you.

922
00:56:06,701 --> 00:56:07,635
<i>And before you start whining</i>

923
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:08,970
<i>about the ecosystem,</i>

924
00:56:09,003 --> 00:56:10,972
<i>who cares?</i>
<i>We'll make billions.</i>

925
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:13,507
<i>And no one is going to see</i>
<i>the damage we do.</i>

926
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:14,575
Shut up!

927
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:18,112
<i>Jess,</i>
<i>I've already dispatched</i>

928
00:56:18,145 --> 00:56:20,615
<i>a clean-up crew to Mana One.</i>

929
00:56:20,648 --> 00:56:21,716
<i>Finish this.</i>

930
00:56:26,153 --> 00:56:28,890
How do we
open the door?

931
00:56:28,923 --> 00:56:31,125
If we could
cut the comm link
to the surface...

932
00:56:32,193 --> 00:56:33,728
she couldn't control anything.

933
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:35,096
But it's back
in the first room,

934
00:56:35,129 --> 00:56:37,131
and there's no getting through
this door.

935
00:56:37,164 --> 00:56:39,166
This airlock still works!

936
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,569
Why would you go through
the airlock? There's no pod.

937
00:56:41,602 --> 00:56:43,671
I'll swim to the airlock
where we came in

938
00:56:43,704 --> 00:56:45,006
and do the override.

939
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:48,109
You have no suit.
How could it work?

940
00:56:48,142 --> 00:56:50,144
Water doesn't compress
under pressure,

941
00:56:50,177 --> 00:56:52,213
so if he can force water
in his sinus cavities,

942
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:54,849
he could survive 30,
maybe 60 seconds

943
00:56:54,882 --> 00:56:56,183
before he passes out.

944
00:56:56,217 --> 00:56:57,518
It is possible.

945
00:56:59,887 --> 00:57:01,822
We work the problems
one by one.

946
00:57:03,658 --> 00:57:06,527
We do what's in front of us,
then we do the next thing.

947
00:57:14,635 --> 00:57:16,137
If anyone
can do this,

948
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:17,838
it's you.

949
00:57:35,656 --> 00:57:38,059
Won't he be crushed
by the pressure?

950
00:57:38,092 --> 00:57:39,961
It doesn't work
like that.

951
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:43,698
You don't see fish
wearing metal suits, do you?

952
00:57:43,731 --> 00:57:46,767
It's about air.
It reacts under pressure.

953
00:57:46,801 --> 00:57:49,537
And that's why he has to
blow it out of his sinuses.

954
00:58:49,163 --> 00:58:50,898
Hey there,
tree hugger.

955
00:58:55,069 --> 00:58:57,972
Jonas Taylor, eco-warrior,

956
00:58:58,005 --> 00:59:00,007
fighting the good fight.

957
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:02,009
Well, guess what?

958
00:59:02,043 --> 00:59:03,044
You lost.

959
00:59:08,015 --> 00:59:11,752
I spent two years
in a Manila prison

960
00:59:11,786 --> 00:59:14,655
after you
and your eco-freak buddies

961
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:17,358
had our ship seized.

962
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:20,027
I thought about you
every single day.

963
00:59:21,695 --> 00:59:24,231
You don't even remember me,
do you?

964
00:59:24,265 --> 00:59:25,866
Hmm?

965
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,268
No?

966
00:59:27,301 --> 00:59:29,637
Montes.

967
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:32,606
There's a million scumbags
in this world.

968
00:59:35,376 --> 00:59:37,611
It's hard to keep track
of all of 'em.

969
00:59:54,128 --> 00:59:55,629
I don't think I can make it!

970
00:59:55,663 --> 00:59:57,064
You can do it. It's okay.

971
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,314
We're going to die!

972
01:00:47,348 --> 01:00:48,349
It's ok, it's ok.

973
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:47,374
Meiying!

974
01:01:48,242 --> 01:01:49,243
Meiying!

975
01:02:08,395 --> 01:02:10,431
Clean up crew
approaching Mana One.

976
01:02:10,464 --> 01:02:12,766
<i>About time.</i>
<i>We are on alert.</i>

977
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,169
<i>Everyone confined</i>
<i>to their quarters.</i>

978
01:02:15,202 --> 01:02:17,539
<i>We need to get control</i>
<i>of Mana One</i>

979
01:02:17,572 --> 01:02:19,507
<i>and dispose</i>
<i>of any liabilities.</i>

980
01:02:24,512 --> 01:02:25,913
What's the emergency?

981
01:02:25,946 --> 01:02:27,881
I got into
the security backup.

982
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:28,949
Look at this.

983
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:32,520
Jess disabled the rescue sub.

984
01:02:34,088 --> 01:02:36,156
-What?
-Watch.

985
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:37,891
Like she could be
repairing it, right?

986
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:39,093
But no, wait.

987
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:44,932
It's Montes' sub.

988
01:02:44,965 --> 01:02:46,367
That's our ride out of here.

989
01:02:54,475 --> 01:02:55,943
There's a leak
in the hydraulics.

990
01:02:55,976 --> 01:02:57,579
Predator countermeasures
are down.

991
01:02:57,612 --> 01:02:59,581
We'll never make it
past the megs.

992
01:02:59,614 --> 01:03:01,315
We need
a distraction.

993
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,052
Light up the station.
The megs will attack it.

994
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:06,487
Yeah. And kill us.

995
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:09,089
Not if we're fast enough.

996
01:03:09,123 --> 01:03:10,024
Jiuming!

997
01:03:18,132 --> 01:03:19,967
- Hey, Rigas.
- Yep?

998
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,835
For a moment, I thought you
were gonna kill me back there.

999
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:24,305
Well, she did say
to shoot you in the heart.

1000
01:03:24,338 --> 01:03:26,541
And I know for a fact
you ain't got one of those.

1001
01:03:31,912 --> 01:03:33,147
Thank you for working.

1002
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:48,530
Gotta close
the hatch, Jonas.

1003
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,034
We're all gonna die.

1004
01:03:55,603 --> 01:03:56,638
He's gonna make it.

1005
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,838
No, he's not.

1006
01:04:01,075 --> 01:04:02,242
-He's gonna make it.
-No!

1007
01:04:02,276 --> 01:04:04,244
We have to close the hatch!

1008
01:04:09,049 --> 01:04:10,518
Close it! Jonas!

1009
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,494
I'm here!

1010
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:23,897
That's him!

1011
01:04:35,309 --> 01:04:36,377
That was close.

1012
01:04:38,145 --> 01:04:39,179
Too close.

1013
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:44,118
You should have shut
the hatch.

1014
01:04:44,151 --> 01:04:46,019
Yeah.
Meiying would have killed me.

1015
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,693
You thought about it, though.

1016
01:04:51,726 --> 01:04:53,193
Yeah. We thought about it.

1017
01:04:53,994 --> 01:04:55,095
Didn't we, Rigas?

1018
01:04:55,129 --> 01:04:56,930
Shut up.

1019
01:04:57,965 --> 01:05:00,000
Just a little bit.

1020
01:05:00,033 --> 01:05:01,636
Very funny.

1021
01:05:09,977 --> 01:05:11,145
Explosives?

1022
01:05:12,614 --> 01:05:13,615
Check this out.

1023
01:05:13,648 --> 01:05:15,349
Look what else.

1024
01:05:28,195 --> 01:05:30,130
Is that gonna be
a problem?

1025
01:05:30,164 --> 01:05:32,299
It's a hole
in the thermal layer.

1026
01:05:32,332 --> 01:05:35,402
It must have been caused
by the mining explosions.

1027
01:05:35,436 --> 01:05:37,004
It will seal up eventually.

1028
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:39,306
Eventually?

1029
01:05:39,339 --> 01:05:41,709
Yeah. Within an hour.

1030
01:05:41,743 --> 01:05:43,678
Can the megs
follow us through?

1031
01:05:44,779 --> 01:05:46,113
I hope not.

1032
01:06:10,471 --> 01:06:12,406
Boys,
I don't want to harm you,

1033
01:06:12,439 --> 01:06:14,475
but I do need you
to come out of this room.

1034
01:06:14,509 --> 01:06:16,678
It's Jess.
She's got three soldiers.

1035
01:06:17,812 --> 01:06:19,446
Yeah. It's go time.

1036
01:06:20,414 --> 01:06:21,616
Take this.

1037
01:06:21,649 --> 01:06:23,050
-The hell is this?
-It's a Taser.

1038
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:25,452
Open up.

1039
01:06:25,486 --> 01:06:26,688
They tried to kill Jonas,

1040
01:06:26,721 --> 01:06:28,021
they're definitely
gonna kill us.

1041
01:06:28,055 --> 01:06:29,423
Okay, listen.
Here's the plan.

1042
01:06:29,456 --> 01:06:31,358
On the count of three,
you'll open the door

1043
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:33,160
and I'mma pepper spray 'em.

1044
01:06:33,193 --> 01:06:34,394
Right, and you'll shut the door
and you're gonna wait.

1045
01:06:34,428 --> 01:06:36,163
Then go out there
and use the Taser.

1046
01:06:36,196 --> 01:06:37,665
One, two, three.

1047
01:06:40,835 --> 01:06:43,638
No, Mac, no! No, Mac...

1048
01:06:43,671 --> 01:06:46,541
It burns! It burns!

1049
01:06:46,574 --> 01:06:48,108
I'm sorry!

1050
01:06:48,141 --> 01:06:49,611
Sleepy time.

1051
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:05,325
What's that?

1052
01:07:08,362 --> 01:07:09,396
Trouble.

1053
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:19,641
So, we're walking fast
and with

1054
01:07:19,674 --> 01:07:21,709
a lot of determination,
which is great.

1055
01:07:21,743 --> 01:07:24,077
But what exactly
is the plan here?

1056
01:07:24,111 --> 01:07:25,379
They're armed and we're not.

1057
01:07:30,718 --> 01:07:32,252
All righty.
So what are you thinking?

1058
01:07:33,555 --> 01:07:35,590
What are you thinking?

1059
01:07:35,623 --> 01:07:37,291
You and I find Mac and DJ.

1060
01:07:37,324 --> 01:07:38,760
Rigas, grab what you can.

1061
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:40,193
Secure a Zodiac
so we can get off this thing.

1062
01:07:40,227 --> 01:07:41,563
Rock and roll.

1063
01:07:41,596 --> 01:07:43,297
Safest if Meiying
goes with you.

1064
01:07:51,573 --> 01:07:53,608
I'll protect her with my life.

1065
01:07:53,641 --> 01:07:54,742
And I'll protect her
with mine.

1066
01:07:55,543 --> 01:07:56,544
No.

1067
01:07:56,578 --> 01:07:57,745
No.

1068
01:07:57,779 --> 01:07:58,846
No.

1069
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,281
Let's go.

1070
01:08:13,528 --> 01:08:15,630
I told you to wait
before you went out that door.

1071
01:08:15,663 --> 01:08:17,632
-How's your eyes?
-My eye stings.

1072
01:08:17,665 --> 01:08:20,602
If we climb up
to the communications array,

1073
01:08:20,635 --> 01:08:22,804
we can bypass the DCC
and we can call for help.

1074
01:08:22,837 --> 01:08:24,171
What are we supposed to say?

1075
01:08:24,204 --> 01:08:26,440
Uh... terrorist action?

1076
01:08:26,473 --> 01:08:28,810
-Yeah, good. Terrorist action.
-Yeah, terrorist action.

1077
01:08:28,843 --> 01:08:30,310
- Okay.
- You got a better idea?

1078
01:08:30,344 --> 01:08:31,813
Freeze!

1079
01:08:31,846 --> 01:08:32,847
Oh, no.

1080
01:08:42,657 --> 01:08:44,358
DJ! DJ!

1081
01:08:46,326 --> 01:08:47,427
What the hell?

1082
01:08:47,461 --> 01:08:50,598
Wow! Yeah, baby!
Get some!

1083
01:08:50,632 --> 01:08:51,799
-Hey.
-Run, Mac! Run!

1084
01:08:53,266 --> 01:08:54,334
Go, go, go!

1085
01:09:06,914 --> 01:09:08,549
Spread out!
Find 'em.

1086
01:09:11,853 --> 01:09:14,822
You got Tasers?
Now you can swim?

1087
01:09:14,856 --> 01:09:17,759
All of a sudden you run around
like you're frickin' Batman.

1088
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:20,193
Hell yeah.

1089
01:09:20,227 --> 01:09:23,497
After last time,
y'all begged me to come back.

1090
01:09:23,531 --> 01:09:26,534
"DJ, oh, we family, DJ."

1091
01:09:26,567 --> 01:09:29,469
"DJ, we need you."
Yeah, all right. Bet.

1092
01:09:29,504 --> 01:09:30,805
But I ain't stupid.

1093
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:32,205
I trained up,
I learned how to fight,

1094
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:33,741
I learned how to swim,

1095
01:09:33,775 --> 01:09:35,743
and I will never go anywhere
without my survival pack.

1096
01:09:35,777 --> 01:09:37,411
-Survival pack?
-Yeah.

1097
01:09:37,444 --> 01:09:38,680
Check this out.

1098
01:09:38,713 --> 01:09:40,815
Mmm-hmm. Come here, baby.
Come here.

1099
01:09:40,848 --> 01:09:43,417
Bam.

1100
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:46,253
Yeah, I even made
poison-tipped bullets,

1101
01:09:46,286 --> 01:09:48,388
just like <i>Jaws 2.</i>

1102
01:09:51,893 --> 01:09:53,594
Come on, DJ!
Let's go, let's go.

1103
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:58,331
This is insane.

1104
01:10:01,903 --> 01:10:03,403
Freeze, assholes.

1105
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:07,575
Yeah, freeze.

1106
01:10:07,608 --> 01:10:08,676
You got this?

1107
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:15,449
That was some
unfortunate shit back there.

1108
01:10:15,482 --> 01:10:17,552
No, please!
Don't shoot!

1109
01:10:20,287 --> 01:10:21,723
I know you're
looking for me and Jonas.

1110
01:10:21,756 --> 01:10:23,323
I also know
you don't speak Chinese,

1111
01:10:23,356 --> 01:10:26,027
but I'm speaking it
to distract you guys,

1112
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,563
because my friend is about
to attack you from behind.

1113
01:10:28,596 --> 01:10:29,897
What?

1114
01:10:35,603 --> 01:10:37,437
sucker.

1115
01:10:40,608 --> 01:10:42,543
I thought you were dead.

1116
01:10:42,577 --> 01:10:44,444
Wishful thinking, Mac.

1117
01:10:44,478 --> 01:10:46,848
If it ain't
the deviated septum.

1118
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:48,415
Boat's leaving.

1119
01:10:52,687 --> 01:10:53,921
What's our status?

1120
01:10:53,955 --> 01:10:54,889
Bravo team
are inbound.

1121
01:10:54,922 --> 01:10:55,957
ETA, ten minutes.

1122
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:57,024
Excellent.

1123
01:10:58,826 --> 01:11:00,327
Uh, what are you doing here?

1124
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:05,566
Mmm.

1125
01:11:07,769 --> 01:11:09,670
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1126
01:11:10,705 --> 01:11:12,907
Jonas is on Mana One.

1127
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:15,810
We need to lock this place
down now.

1128
01:11:17,912 --> 01:11:19,781
Search the station
top to bottom.

1129
01:11:19,814 --> 01:11:21,414
Secure personnel
in their quarters,

1130
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:22,617
kill anyone else.

1131
01:11:23,084 --> 01:11:25,052
Go! Go!

1132
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,561
Oh, my God.

1133
01:11:38,599 --> 01:11:40,400
Uh, guys?

1134
01:11:41,102 --> 01:11:43,538
We've got a big problem.

1135
01:11:51,746 --> 01:11:53,380
<i>We tracked three megs</i>

1136
01:11:53,413 --> 01:11:54,749
<i>that escaped</i>
<i>before the breach closed.</i>

1137
01:11:54,782 --> 01:11:56,784
We're gonna need
a good cover story for this.

1138
01:11:56,818 --> 01:11:58,451
<i>Well, that shouldn't be hard.</i>

1139
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:00,755
Everyone knows Jonas
and Jiuming were reckless.

1140
01:12:00,788 --> 01:12:02,857
No, we need a hero.

1141
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:04,859
Like, someone to emerge

1142
01:12:04,892 --> 01:12:06,861
from this
unforeseeable tragedy,

1143
01:12:06,894 --> 01:12:08,963
who can step into
a leadership position

1144
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:10,430
<i>at the Institute.</i>

1145
01:12:10,463 --> 01:12:14,001
Jess, are you ready
for promotion?

1146
01:12:14,035 --> 01:12:16,604
I appreciate your confidence.

1147
01:12:16,637 --> 01:12:17,805
<i>Jess!</i>

1148
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:19,006
It's from
the thermocline breach.

1149
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,473
But you can relax.

1150
01:12:20,508 --> 01:12:22,810
This place? Meg-proof.

1151
01:12:22,844 --> 01:12:24,645
I mean, Jonas was
always afraid of this,

1152
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:26,413
but I think, between trackers
and gunships,

1153
01:12:26,446 --> 01:12:28,448
we can solve the problem
and come out the other side

1154
01:12:28,481 --> 01:12:30,450
<i>with a significant positive</i>
<i>PR spin.</i>

1155
01:12:31,085 --> 01:12:32,119
Yeah, I'm on it.

1156
01:12:32,153 --> 01:12:33,353
I was also thinking...

1157
01:12:59,213 --> 01:13:00,781
What now?

1158
01:13:00,815 --> 01:13:02,783
It's our only way off.
We have to take it.

1159
01:13:02,817 --> 01:13:03,985
But that thing
doesn't have the range

1160
01:13:04,018 --> 01:13:06,453
to get us to the mainland.

1161
01:13:06,486 --> 01:13:08,089
You're worried about
the destination?

1162
01:13:08,122 --> 01:13:09,857
What about
the first hundred yards?

1163
01:13:09,891 --> 01:13:11,626
That's where we goin' die.

1164
01:13:11,659 --> 01:13:12,960
We paddle out slow.

1165
01:13:12,994 --> 01:13:15,529
No engines.
Minimal motion.

1166
01:13:15,563 --> 01:13:16,898
We won't look like food.

1167
01:13:16,931 --> 01:13:19,166
When we're clear,
we make a run for it. Huh?

1168
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,433
Let's do it.

1169
01:13:22,103 --> 01:13:24,105
I still think
we look like food.

1170
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:26,707
Shh.
Quiet, everyone.

1171
01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:28,109
Paddle slowly.

1172
01:13:28,142 --> 01:13:30,745
This feels
unpleasantly familiar.

1173
01:13:30,778 --> 01:13:32,914
I just hope it goes better
than last time.

1174
01:13:33,814 --> 01:13:34,849
What happened last time?

1175
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:36,984
You don't wanna know.

1176
01:13:41,889 --> 01:13:44,225
Oh.
Here he comes.

1177
01:13:50,998 --> 01:13:52,133
Go, go, go!

1178
01:13:54,168 --> 01:13:56,170
Let's not
bring 'em back alive.

1179
01:13:57,738 --> 01:13:59,439
You do know how to
drive this thing, right?

1180
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,749
Stop! Stop the engine
right now.

1181
01:14:10,151 --> 01:14:11,852
Or you will attract the megs.

1182
01:14:13,187 --> 01:14:16,657
Okay. Be still.

1183
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:18,491
No motion whatsoever.

1184
01:14:23,564 --> 01:14:24,899
I have the shot.

1185
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,768
Take it.

1186
01:14:27,802 --> 01:14:29,503
- Get down!
- Mate, do your job.

1187
01:14:29,537 --> 01:14:30,271
-Take the bloody shot.
-It's not easy as it looks.

1188
01:14:35,109 --> 01:14:36,911
He got 'em!
He ate 'em!

1189
01:14:36,944 --> 01:14:38,145
He ate the whole boat!

1190
01:14:41,148 --> 01:14:43,150
What happened?

1191
01:14:43,184 --> 01:14:45,252
<i>Jess is dead.</i>

1192
01:14:45,286 --> 01:14:46,954
-What?
<i>-We stabilized Mana One</i>

1193
01:14:46,988 --> 01:14:49,156
<i>but Taylor and Zhang</i>
<i>have escaped.</i>

1194
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:50,524
What do you want me to do?

1195
01:14:50,558 --> 01:14:51,993
<i>Fix it! Kill them!</i>

1196
01:14:52,026 --> 01:14:54,261
<i>You do this,</i>
<i>you write your own ticket.</i>

1197
01:14:54,295 --> 01:14:55,763
You are set for life.

1198
01:14:56,797 --> 01:14:58,933
Okay.

1199
01:14:58,966 --> 01:15:01,202
There's only a couple places
they could make it to.

1200
01:15:01,235 --> 01:15:03,637
<i>Are you crying, Montes?</i>

1201
01:15:15,883 --> 01:15:17,184
Any sign of the megs?

1202
01:15:18,152 --> 01:15:19,787
Negative.

1203
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:21,822
There's no way
this thing's gonna work.

1204
01:15:22,823 --> 01:15:24,291
It's gonna work.

1205
01:15:24,325 --> 01:15:26,260
Bloke, you got more chance
of blowing up yourself

1206
01:15:26,293 --> 01:15:28,229
than one of the megs.

1207
01:15:28,262 --> 01:15:29,997
At least I won't get eaten.

1208
01:15:30,031 --> 01:15:31,932
Ha, I hear that.

1209
01:15:31,966 --> 01:15:33,901
Jo, can you make me one?

1210
01:15:35,636 --> 01:15:37,638
I got you covered, Mac.

1211
01:15:37,671 --> 01:15:39,707
We have to find a way
to warn people.

1212
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:42,043
In case the megs
move towards land.

1213
01:15:42,076 --> 01:15:45,880
There's an island 60 klicks
southeast of us.

1214
01:15:45,913 --> 01:15:47,915
It's listed as inhabited.

1215
01:15:47,948 --> 01:15:49,817
Inhabited by who?

1216
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:51,986
The name more or less
translates to...

1217
01:15:52,987 --> 01:15:53,988
Fun Island.

1218
01:15:55,122 --> 01:15:56,157
Fun Island?

1219
01:16:01,962 --> 01:16:03,064
Yeah!

1220
01:16:08,269 --> 01:16:12,740
Welcome to Fun Island.
Our resort has everything.

1221
01:16:12,773 --> 01:16:15,309
The restaurant, amazing.

1222
01:16:15,342 --> 01:16:17,878
The disco, incredible.

1223
01:16:17,912 --> 01:16:19,713
- And our spa, to die for.
- Oh.

1224
01:16:19,747 --> 01:16:21,749
- Oh.
- OMG.

1225
01:16:21,782 --> 01:16:24,118
It's our special dish.
Seafood Surprise!

1226
01:16:24,151 --> 01:16:26,787
Wow! I wouldn't know
where to start.

1227
01:16:26,821 --> 01:16:28,823
Well, just don't miss out
on the grilled shark.

1228
01:16:28,856 --> 01:16:30,391
Pippin! Pippin!

1229
01:16:30,424 --> 01:16:31,892
Pippin!

1230
01:16:31,926 --> 01:16:33,828
- Whoa, what is that?
- Pippin!

1231
01:16:33,861 --> 01:16:35,262
What are
they running from?

1232
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:40,201
Your first time
at the rodeo?

1233
01:16:41,969 --> 01:16:44,338
I worked with your dad since
before you were born.

1234
01:16:44,371 --> 01:16:45,940
I never had this kind
of trouble from him.

1235
01:16:45,973 --> 01:16:47,942
Can you put your phone down?

1236
01:16:47,975 --> 01:16:50,344
After all these hard years
we're finally on vacation,

1237
01:16:50,377 --> 01:16:52,980
savor the moment.

1238
01:16:53,013 --> 01:16:54,915
Yeah, and I yelled at him too.

1239
01:16:54,949 --> 01:16:58,152
I've already got 400 likes.

1240
01:16:59,687 --> 01:17:00,855
I'm sitting in paradise

1241
01:17:00,888 --> 01:17:02,756
and you are ruining it!

1242
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:03,924
Who does that? Who...

1243
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:05,893
ruins paradise
for other people?

1244
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:10,364
Hey, baby.

1245
01:17:10,397 --> 01:17:12,066
Wanna rub some oil on my back?

1246
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,869
No?

1247
01:17:14,902 --> 01:17:15,936
How 'bout my front?

1248
01:17:16,437 --> 01:17:17,404
Ew.

1249
01:17:23,244 --> 01:17:24,278
Come over.

1250
01:17:25,379 --> 01:17:26,680
What?

1251
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:31,385
What are you doing?

1252
01:17:37,391 --> 01:17:38,392
Yaoyao...

1253
01:17:41,428 --> 01:17:42,429
Will you marry me?

1254
01:17:47,735 --> 01:17:49,270
Find it, idiot!

1255
01:17:49,904 --> 01:17:50,905
Wait!

1256
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:54,909
Have you found it?

1257
01:17:58,779 --> 01:17:59,780
Hey.

1258
01:18:03,117 --> 01:18:04,285
Yaoyao.

1259
01:18:05,419 --> 01:18:07,388
Yaoyao.

1260
01:18:07,421 --> 01:18:09,323
Yaoyao! Yaoyao!

1261
01:18:42,524 --> 01:18:43,857
This doesn't look good.

1262
01:18:43,891 --> 01:18:46,327
Rigas, get us there fast!

1263
01:18:53,834 --> 01:18:55,402
Kill the cell phone uplink.

1264
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:08,550
There's a lot
of exposure for us on this.

1265
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:10,918
Take care of Jonas
and his team quickly,

1266
01:19:10,951 --> 01:19:12,386
and quietly.

1267
01:19:15,022 --> 01:19:16,558
Everybody
out of the water!

1268
01:19:16,591 --> 01:19:18,892
- Shark! Shark!
- Get back on the beach!

1269
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:21,428
Get out of the water!

1270
01:19:21,462 --> 01:19:22,830
Get back on the beach, every...

1271
01:19:26,233 --> 01:19:27,801
<i>Mobile comms</i>
<i>are down. Over.</i>

1272
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,114
You copy, guys?

1273
01:20:15,617 --> 01:20:18,152
Crocodile!

1274
01:20:18,185 --> 01:20:19,554
What is that?

1275
01:20:19,587 --> 01:20:21,155
- Move, move!
- Get into the chopper.

1276
01:20:21,188 --> 01:20:22,923
Now! Go with her!

1277
01:20:27,294 --> 01:20:29,330
Mmm. Mmm.

1278
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,873
Everybody out!

1279
01:20:39,907 --> 01:20:40,941
Shark!

1280
01:20:40,974 --> 01:20:42,009
Shark!

1281
01:20:42,042 --> 01:20:43,043
Go back!

1282
01:20:43,077 --> 01:20:44,011
Don't go into the water!

1283
01:20:44,044 --> 01:20:45,580
There's a shark!

1284
01:20:45,613 --> 01:20:47,014
Get on the beach!

1285
01:20:47,047 --> 01:20:48,215
Go back!

1286
01:20:48,248 --> 01:20:49,584
We have to save them.

1287
01:20:49,617 --> 01:20:51,952
-I'm not leaving ya.
-Cell phone's down.

1288
01:20:51,985 --> 01:20:53,354
Hello? Hello?

1289
01:20:53,387 --> 01:20:54,988
- No signal.
- There's no choice.

1290
01:20:55,022 --> 01:20:56,390
- She's right.
- We got no signal, guys.

1291
01:20:56,423 --> 01:20:58,459
Hey, you two!
Find a way to call for help.

1292
01:20:58,492 --> 01:21:00,227
Let everyone know
what happened.

1293
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,395
Come on! Come on!
This way! This way!

1294
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:03,631
You're gonna hide.

1295
01:21:03,665 --> 01:21:05,332
See that lifeguard tower?

1296
01:21:05,366 --> 01:21:06,668
-Yeah.
-You go there
and you stay there.

1297
01:21:06,701 --> 01:21:08,001
This is not
one of those things

1298
01:21:08,035 --> 01:21:09,336
where I tell you
to do something,

1299
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:10,605
you say "yes,"

1300
01:21:10,638 --> 01:21:12,039
and then you do
whatever you want.

1301
01:21:12,072 --> 01:21:13,374
Understand?

1302
01:21:13,407 --> 01:21:15,008
Yes.

1303
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:16,210
You're not messing with me?

1304
01:21:16,243 --> 01:21:17,945
No.

1305
01:21:17,978 --> 01:21:19,947
I can't do what I need to do
if I'm worried about you.

1306
01:21:20,715 --> 01:21:22,416
I'll be fine.

1307
01:21:22,449 --> 01:21:23,951
Promise me
you'll come back.

1308
01:21:27,354 --> 01:21:28,922
You know I love you.

1309
01:22:08,362 --> 01:22:09,463
Oh, shit.

1310
01:22:14,334 --> 01:22:15,670
Sonny.

1311
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:17,705
Check that out.

1312
01:22:21,576 --> 01:22:23,243
Hey, yo, my man.
You got a phone?

1313
01:22:24,579 --> 01:22:26,046
What's everyone running from?

1314
01:22:27,414 --> 01:22:29,584
What the hell was that?

1315
01:22:29,617 --> 01:22:30,685
Three megs.

1316
01:22:30,718 --> 01:22:32,019
Three of us.

1317
01:22:32,052 --> 01:22:33,454
We each grab a jet ski.

1318
01:22:33,487 --> 01:22:34,656
Get them to chase it away

1319
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:36,658
from these people
and out to sea.

1320
01:22:36,691 --> 01:22:38,091
Then we harpoon them.

1321
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:39,561
Oh, you mean
with those jerry-rigged,

1322
01:22:39,594 --> 01:22:42,095
maybe-they-work,
maybe-they-kill-us harpoons?

1323
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:43,163
Yeah.

1324
01:22:43,197 --> 01:22:44,766
It's a terrible idea.

1325
01:22:44,799 --> 01:22:46,099
You got a better one?

1326
01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:47,267
No. No.

1327
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:48,770
-Then we're agreed.
-Yeah.

1328
01:22:48,803 --> 01:22:50,103
-Good.
-Great.

1329
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:06,420
Montes!

1330
01:23:08,455 --> 01:23:09,456
Shit.

1331
01:23:37,484 --> 01:23:39,019
Let's go old school.

1332
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:47,294
The landline's down, too.

1333
01:23:47,327 --> 01:23:49,029
Okay, coast is clear.
Let's go.

1334
01:23:55,737 --> 01:23:57,070
They can walk?

1335
01:23:58,573 --> 01:23:59,507
Shit.

1336
01:24:01,108 --> 01:24:02,409
It's those things.

1337
01:24:02,442 --> 01:24:04,244
They haven't spotted us yet.

1338
01:24:04,278 --> 01:24:06,848
Okay.

1339
01:24:11,418 --> 01:24:12,854
What else you got in here?

1340
01:24:12,887 --> 01:24:14,488
Emergency stuff.

1341
01:24:17,124 --> 01:24:18,125
Okay.

1342
01:24:21,495 --> 01:24:23,798
Really? Condoms?

1343
01:24:23,831 --> 01:24:25,700
Different kind of emergencies.

1344
01:24:25,733 --> 01:24:26,534
Hand me that.

1345
01:24:30,437 --> 01:24:32,105
Now hand me
that gum in your mouth.

1346
01:24:34,408 --> 01:24:35,475
Thank you.

1347
01:24:48,523 --> 01:24:50,223
There's only one ski.

1348
01:24:50,257 --> 01:24:51,325
Give me your harpoons.

1349
01:24:52,627 --> 01:24:54,194
You sure?

1350
01:24:54,227 --> 01:24:55,128
Oh...

1351
01:24:59,366 --> 01:25:00,868
- I got this.
- Good luck.

1352
01:25:02,235 --> 01:25:04,171
We need more firepower.

1353
01:25:04,204 --> 01:25:05,205
Yeah.

1354
01:25:06,774 --> 01:25:09,209
I have an idea.
Let's go.

1355
01:25:17,919 --> 01:25:19,654
Not this time, Taylor.

1356
01:25:21,589 --> 01:25:22,590
<i>Vamos.</i>

1357
01:25:41,341 --> 01:25:42,744
This should be
the place.

1358
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:46,781
Come on.

1359
01:25:53,253 --> 01:25:54,354
What are we looking for?

1360
01:25:55,957 --> 01:25:57,457
Ammonium nitrate.

1361
01:25:58,893 --> 01:26:00,394
You're making a bomb?

1362
01:26:00,427 --> 01:26:02,764
This stuff is
as powerful as TNT.

1363
01:26:02,797 --> 01:26:03,898
Hey!

1364
01:26:03,931 --> 01:26:05,967
Get in! Get in!

1365
01:26:11,304 --> 01:26:12,406
Freeze!

1366
01:26:30,323 --> 01:26:31,291
Come on!

1367
01:27:02,957 --> 01:27:03,925
Come on!

1368
01:27:16,938 --> 01:27:18,606
Come on, let's see
if he's got a phone.

1369
01:27:21,943 --> 01:27:23,945
I got the sat phone.
I got the sat...

1370
01:27:23,978 --> 01:27:25,713
I got the phone.
Why you stealing his money?

1371
01:27:25,747 --> 01:27:27,314
What? He's not gonna need it.

1372
01:27:27,347 --> 01:27:29,050
Uh-oh.

1373
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:32,653
Nice doggies. Nice doggies.

1374
01:27:32,687 --> 01:27:33,955
Okay, Rigas.

1375
01:27:33,988 --> 01:27:36,323
On the count of three,
we're gonna bolt.

1376
01:27:36,356 --> 01:27:38,391
One. Two. Three!

1377
01:27:38,425 --> 01:27:39,694
What the hell? Hey!

1378
01:27:40,895 --> 01:27:43,731
Wait for DJ!
Wait for DJ!

1379
01:27:45,767 --> 01:27:47,802
They're right
behind us!

1380
01:27:47,835 --> 01:27:49,302
Let's hide in here!

1381
01:27:49,336 --> 01:27:51,338
Come on. Come on.
Come here. Come here.

1382
01:27:51,371 --> 01:27:53,373
-What the hell?
-Hi, DJ. Hi, Rigas.

1383
01:27:53,406 --> 01:27:54,509
- Whoa.
- All of you together.

1384
01:27:54,542 --> 01:27:56,778
Up against the wall.
Hands up!

1385
01:27:56,811 --> 01:27:57,879
I wouldn't point that at me

1386
01:27:57,912 --> 01:27:59,981
if I were you.
Trust me.

1387
01:28:00,014 --> 01:28:01,983
Shut it!
Keep your hands in the air.

1388
01:28:02,016 --> 01:28:03,084
Hands up!

1389
01:28:06,954 --> 01:28:08,823
Don't want to hurt you,

1390
01:28:08,856 --> 01:28:11,458
so I'm going
to give you one chance.

1391
01:28:11,491 --> 01:28:13,094
Put those weapons down.

1392
01:28:13,127 --> 01:28:14,394
Or you'll do what?

1393
01:28:15,596 --> 01:28:17,430
Stay still, little guy.

1394
01:28:23,671 --> 01:28:25,072
No, no! Joe, Joe, door!

1395
01:28:25,106 --> 01:28:27,809
Stay where you are!

1396
01:28:27,842 --> 01:28:29,577
- Go, go!
- Get to cover!

1397
01:28:47,628 --> 01:28:48,663
Damn!

1398
01:28:52,033 --> 01:28:53,067
I got signal.

1399
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:54,502
Call for help!

1400
01:28:54,535 --> 01:28:56,737
To get down to the beach
and help people!

1401
01:28:56,771 --> 01:28:58,105
Where are you going?

1402
01:28:58,139 --> 01:29:00,041
- Stealing a chopper.
- What chopper?

1403
01:29:00,074 --> 01:29:01,441
Global rescue?

1404
01:29:01,474 --> 01:29:02,777
We need rescue!

1405
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:04,477
We need you to send
everybody you got!

1406
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:06,013
The National Guard,
the lifeguard,

1407
01:29:06,047 --> 01:29:07,648
the Coast Guard. Anybody!

1408
01:29:07,682 --> 01:29:08,816
Just come now!

1409
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:16,984
Ugh, looks like
someone else

1410
01:30:17,018 --> 01:30:18,119
had the same idea.

1411
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,755
We need a plan.

1412
01:30:20,788 --> 01:30:23,024
We have to lead it away
and steal the chopper.

1413
01:30:23,057 --> 01:30:26,160
Okay, you lead it away,
I'll steal the chopper.

1414
01:30:26,193 --> 01:30:27,695
You distract it,
I'll get the chopper.

1415
01:30:27,728 --> 01:30:28,829
Why me?

1416
01:30:28,863 --> 01:30:30,031
Can you fly a chopper?

1417
01:30:30,064 --> 01:30:31,464
Yeah, I can.

1418
01:30:31,498 --> 01:30:32,600
-You have a license?
-Yes, I do!

1419
01:30:32,633 --> 01:30:33,834
-I didn't know that.
-What?

1420
01:30:33,868 --> 01:30:35,136
Okay, good plan.

1421
01:30:35,169 --> 01:30:36,170
Mac!

1422
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:16,577
Jiuming! We gotta go!

1423
01:31:23,184 --> 01:31:25,052
Fuel! Get the fuel!

1424
01:31:25,086 --> 01:31:26,087
Gas! We need gas!

1425
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:34,595
Get up!

1426
01:31:39,967 --> 01:31:41,068
Get the fuel!

1427
01:31:47,742 --> 01:31:49,210
Lizard incoming! Hold on!

1428
01:31:49,243 --> 01:31:51,779
Jiuming? Jiuming!

1429
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:03,758
Run!

1430
01:32:10,664 --> 01:32:11,632
Go!

1431
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:16,637
Whoa, yay!

1432
01:32:18,606 --> 01:32:19,640
Man,
I didn't think you were

1433
01:32:19,673 --> 01:32:20,941
gonna make that one.

1434
01:32:30,151 --> 01:32:31,052
Run!

1435
01:32:44,732 --> 01:32:46,834
No.

1436
01:33:13,227 --> 01:33:14,728
Where are you going,
Jonas?

1437
01:33:56,003 --> 01:33:57,838
Get lower! That's Meiying!

1438
01:33:57,872 --> 01:33:59,206
Are you sure
it's Meiying?

1439
01:34:05,112 --> 01:34:06,213
Get lower!

1440
01:34:06,247 --> 01:34:08,149
Okay, okay!
Hold on!

1441
01:34:23,797 --> 01:34:24,899
Meiying!

1442
01:34:26,501 --> 01:34:27,701
Over here!

1443
01:34:30,771 --> 01:34:31,739
Leap up!

1444
01:35:54,922 --> 01:35:56,123
Jonas is still alive?

1445
01:35:56,156 --> 01:35:57,925
Get me over there!

1446
01:36:03,964 --> 01:36:05,833
Help!

1447
01:36:05,866 --> 01:36:07,101
Hang on, Meiying!

1448
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:24,785
Taylor!

1449
01:36:28,289 --> 01:36:29,890
Come on!

1450
01:36:32,893 --> 01:36:35,162
Come out from under
the bridge, little troll!

1451
01:36:59,219 --> 01:37:01,088
End of the line, no?

1452
01:37:01,121 --> 01:37:02,156
I guess it is.

1453
01:37:03,190 --> 01:37:04,526
You got the gun.

1454
01:37:09,396 --> 01:37:10,431
I won't be needing this.

1455
01:37:14,168 --> 01:37:16,170
I knew you couldn't do it.

1456
01:37:19,206 --> 01:37:20,608
See you later, chum.

1457
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:26,614
Jiu!

1458
01:37:28,916 --> 01:37:30,451
Meiying!

1459
01:37:30,484 --> 01:37:32,286
Throw me the bomb!

1460
01:37:32,319 --> 01:37:33,287
Where?

1461
01:37:35,122 --> 01:37:36,156
Catch it!

1462
01:39:07,414 --> 01:39:09,950
Hold on! I'm coming!

1463
01:39:13,487 --> 01:39:14,622
Meiying!

1464
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:17,559
Meiying!

1465
01:39:17,592 --> 01:39:18,693
Jonas! Over here!

1466
01:39:19,794 --> 01:39:21,495
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1467
01:39:21,529 --> 01:39:23,030
Uncle Jiuming
and Mac's in trouble.

1468
01:39:28,202 --> 01:39:29,604
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

1469
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,280
Mac! Are you okay?

1470
01:39:40,314 --> 01:39:41,315
Mac?

1471
01:40:38,405 --> 01:40:40,274
Come on,
you ugly bastard!

1472
01:41:37,497 --> 01:41:39,299
Come on, come on, come on!

1473
01:41:39,333 --> 01:41:40,635
Come on, come on. I got you,
I got you. Come on, come on!

1474
01:41:40,668 --> 01:41:42,537
Come on!
Watch, watch, watch it!

1475
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:44,304
Come on, come on, come on!

1476
01:41:46,741 --> 01:41:48,843
Meiying,
what are you doing here?

1477
01:41:48,876 --> 01:41:50,210
I had to save the dog!

1478
01:41:50,678 --> 01:41:52,212
What?

1479
01:41:52,245 --> 01:41:53,480
Mommy's here.

1480
01:41:53,514 --> 01:41:55,282
-Thank you! Thank you!
-You're welcome.

1481
01:42:00,622 --> 01:42:01,623
Oh, no, you don't!

1482
01:42:01,656 --> 01:42:02,824
Meiying! Come!

1483
01:42:11,666 --> 01:42:12,667
Hell yeah!

1484
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:14,636
Get some!

1485
01:42:14,669 --> 01:42:17,572
Who says a .50 caliber
is an impractical round?

1486
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:24,512
Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

1487
01:42:24,545 --> 01:42:26,614
Everyone stay still.
No motion.

1488
01:42:28,315 --> 01:42:30,183
No, it's okay.

1489
01:42:30,217 --> 01:42:31,586
That's Haiqi.

1490
01:42:31,619 --> 01:42:32,920
Who cares which one it is?

1491
01:42:33,888 --> 01:42:35,489
She'll listen to me.

1492
01:42:35,523 --> 01:42:37,457
Let's spread out so that thing
don't get us all.

1493
01:42:37,491 --> 01:42:38,492
I got this!

1494
01:43:10,758 --> 01:43:13,695
Yes! I knew it!

1495
01:43:13,728 --> 01:43:16,363
I told you!
We have a special bond.

1496
01:43:16,396 --> 01:43:19,299
- It went after the dolphins.
- No!

1497
01:43:19,332 --> 01:43:20,802
She obeyed my command.

1498
01:43:20,835 --> 01:43:23,604
Ridiculous.

1499
01:43:23,638 --> 01:43:25,940
I didn't believe it before
and I don't believe it now.

1500
01:43:25,973 --> 01:43:27,709
Hey, Mac,
back me up.

1501
01:43:27,742 --> 01:43:29,476
I'm getting out of here
before she changes her mind.

1502
01:43:30,812 --> 01:43:32,013
Mac!

1503
01:43:32,046 --> 01:43:33,881
You guys stay there
and argue.

1504
01:43:33,915 --> 01:43:35,616
She obeyed my command!

1505
01:43:36,951 --> 01:43:38,653
-Dolphins.
-No!

1506
01:43:44,959 --> 01:43:46,894
It's not my fault.

1507
01:43:46,928 --> 01:43:48,261
Sometimes, there's a situation,

1508
01:43:48,295 --> 01:43:49,396
and bad things
are happening,

1509
01:43:49,429 --> 01:43:50,865
and you just have
to get involved.

1510
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:54,334
I'm glad
you finally understand.

1511
01:43:56,604 --> 01:43:57,672
I'm proud of you.

1512
01:44:00,908 --> 01:44:02,375
Next time
don't run around, ok?

1513
01:44:06,446 --> 01:44:09,550
<i>Rescue One</i>
<i>to Fun Island. Over.</i>

1514
01:44:09,584 --> 01:44:11,586
<i>Oh, it's good</i>
<i>to hear your voice, man.</i>

1515
01:44:11,619 --> 01:44:13,721
<i>We got a lot of people</i>
<i>who need help.</i>

1516
01:44:18,025 --> 01:44:19,426
Yeah,
I used to didn't know

1517
01:44:19,459 --> 01:44:20,494
how to swim,
but then, you know,

1518
01:44:20,528 --> 01:44:21,696
you out there chasing sharks,

1519
01:44:21,729 --> 01:44:22,964
you better learn
how to swim quick!

1520
01:44:24,732 --> 01:44:26,433
The water was cold. It wasn't
that cold, but yeah,

1521
01:44:26,466 --> 01:44:28,301
- I was just having fun!
- What about Haiqi?

1522
01:44:29,036 --> 01:44:30,571
She's still out there.

1523
01:44:30,605 --> 01:44:31,939
-Maybe pregnant.
-...lucky to be alive, baby.

1524
01:44:31,973 --> 01:44:32,840
- Oh, preferably not.
- Know what's crazy?

1525
01:44:32,874 --> 01:44:33,941
Like, a few years ago...

1526
01:44:33,975 --> 01:44:35,375
That's tomorrow.

1527
01:44:35,408 --> 01:44:38,378
Today, we count our blessings.

1528
01:44:38,411 --> 01:44:39,614
Here's to being alive.

1529
01:44:41,048 --> 01:44:43,084
Here's to dolphins.

1530
01:44:43,117 --> 01:44:46,587
To Meiying being safe.

1531
01:44:46,621 --> 01:44:48,488
And here's to Sal,
Lance, and Curtis.

1532
01:44:51,759 --> 01:44:53,060
So...

1533
01:44:53,094 --> 01:44:54,427
am I still grounded?

1534
01:44:57,799 --> 01:44:59,332
-Absolutely.
-Absolutely.

1535
01:45:04,972 --> 01:45:06,541
You two are ridiculous.

1536
01:45:08,408 --> 01:45:09,544
But I love you anyway.

1537
01:45:10,578 --> 01:45:11,444
Mmm.

1538
01:45:13,714 --> 01:45:16,784
Looks like you got
a little reckless out there.

1539
01:45:16,818 --> 01:45:19,787
No, everything
was totally under control.

1540
01:45:19,821 --> 01:45:21,622
Yeah, right.

1541
01:45:21,656 --> 01:45:24,091
Well, everything's about to be
totally not under control.

1542
01:45:26,093 --> 01:45:27,094
Give me some.

1543
01:45:31,666 --> 01:45:32,900
Mmm.

1544
01:45:32,934 --> 01:45:34,902
Yeah, that's the good stuff.
