1
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
Hello?

2
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,360
- Sorry.

3
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,720
Can you let me in?

4
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,000
- Hi.
- Hey.

5
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
You ready for tonight?

6
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,880
Yeah.
Yeah, it should be fun.

7
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,720
Um. Have you ever done
anything like this before?

8
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,640
No.
No?

9
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,880
Yeah, it's...
I've done it a few times,

10
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,280
and it is really cool.
Like...

11
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,360
Does anything ever happen?

12
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,960
Uh, yeah.
Yeah.

13
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,640
I mean, every time I've done it,
it's been --

14
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,800
like, something has gone on.

15
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,480
Sounds spooky.

16
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,920
It'll just be
a little different.

17
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,400
Um...

18
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,640
Oh, she's back.
Yay.

19
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,920
Are we just waiting
for the other guys?

20
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,320
Yeah.
Caroline just messaged me

21
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,720
and said she was running
a little bit late.

22
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,560
Okay.
There we go.

23
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,360
Ooh.I think you needed to, uh...

24
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,920
turn off the phone audio.

25
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Ooh.

26
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,600
You got to turn off
the phone audio, I think.

27
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,880
Maybe mute -- mute yourself
on one, or...

28
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,520
Aah...

29
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,920
Uh...
Okay.

30
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,320
Yeah.

31
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,200
That's good.

32
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,360
There she is.

33
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,400
Sorry, do you mind if I just
send a really quick e-mail?

34
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,480
Oh.
Yeah, no, no.

35
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,760
Go for it.

36
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,080
Yeah.

37
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,720
- Hi, guys.
- Hello. - Hi.

38
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,320
How are you? Good. How are you?

39
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm nervous.

40
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,360
What's there to be nervous
about?

41
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,640
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fun.

42
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,720
- Hey, guys.
- Radina!

43
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,880
Hi!
How are you?

44
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,320
- Radina.
- Oh, my God.

45
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,600
Your hair's so lovely
and curly like that.

46
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,760
- Thank you.
- Hello, girl.

47
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,440
Hello.

48
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh, is it something?

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,480
Oh.
She's coughing.

50
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,920
I'm fine, guys.

51
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,880
People are not allowed
to cough anymore.

52
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,360
This is ridiculous.

53
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,760
Well, you have to hide a cough
with a fart now

54
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,440
instead of the other
way around.

55
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,880
That's true.

56
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,640
Tuck it in.

57
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,480
- Oh, Caroline!
- What?

58
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,760
Caroline!

59
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,280
Caroline, there's something
on your face.

60
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,240
My pores are not doing well
in lockdown, so...

61
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,960
- Oh.
- Hello.

62
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,640
- Hi, Pat!
- Hi, Pat.

63
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,920
Did you ask
if he's staying indoors?

64
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,040
No, he's not staying indoors,
are you?

65
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,680
No, no, no, no, no.
I like the sunshine.

66
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,040
Oh, Pat,
you've got to be careful.

67
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,760
I absolutely love it.

68
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,160
Oh, my God. Put it away.

69
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,000
- You're such a flirt!
- Oh, my God!

70
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,520
Bye, Dad.

71
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,080
I love your dad.

72
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,480
You should invite him tonight.

73
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,480
I don't think his heart
could handle it.

74
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,640
He's so cute.
He's been so naughty, though.

75
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,960
Just keeps going out,
and then I have to --

76
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,400
I have to, like,
chase him down the street,

77
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,280
and I'm like,
"Dad, stop it!"

78
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,800
Just excuse me
for one second.

79
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,160
Is she okay?

80
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,840
Yeah, she's alright.

81
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,680
Eh, it doesn't
look alright.

82
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,800
It's a weird situation,
isn't it?

83
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,600
Well, they should have never
moved in together for lockdown.

84
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,720
Yeah, you don't know a person
in that short of time.

85
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,360
Well, what do you know?

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,320
Radina.
Hey.

87
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,520
Hey.

88
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,320
You okay?
Yeah.

89
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,160
Oh, my God, yeah.
Totally fine.

90
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,280
It's like, when we have
an argument,

91
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,960
he just goes
to the bedroom.

92
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,200
Now I have all
this space.

93
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,280
Hey, guys.
Look at this.

94
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,400
This is gonna be us later.

95
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,880
Emma.
Not funny.

96
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,600
I don't like that.

97
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,560
It's gonna appear behind you,
Caroline.

98
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,440
Oh, shut up.

99
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,720
- Emma.
- Wait.

100
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,800
Wait, look what I did.
Hang on.

101
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,440
It takes a while.

102
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,320
This is what lockdown's
led me to.

103
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,280
Look, look.
It's me.

104
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,840
- Oh, my God!
- Got a twin.

105
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,680
- Oh, no.
- There's two of you.

106
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,960
Yeah, no. I got lonely,
so I made a friend.

107
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,080
Oh, my God, guys,
I heard from Teddy.

108
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,760
He's actually gonna
be there tonight.

109
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,040
Oh, he is? Hang on.
Are you serious?

110
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,680
Thought I'd give you
the heads up, Caroline.

111
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Yeah, thanks for that.
A bit late.

112
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,480
Got this shit on my face.

113
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,560
Have you seen his
Instagram posts?

114
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,000
The one with Ginny
or the other one with Ginny?

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,600
Or the first one
with Ginny?

116
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,000
Her parents' house is, like,
a mansion.

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,480
He's so different now.
Like...

118
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,800
Well, it's her.
She's so fucking painful, guys.

119
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,720
You'd never put them together,
'cause Teddy is the opposite.

120
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,360
Well, you can have, like,
three conversations

121
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,160
with her in rotation
and that's about it.

122
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,360
And I've definitely seen her,
like, fake tan hand marks.

123
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,400
Like --Hi, Teddy!

124
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,560
- Hi, Teddy!
- Hi!

125
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,160
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

126
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,480
- Hey.
- Hi, Ginny.

127
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,680
- How you doing, guys?
- Hey, Ginny.

128
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,800
You made it.
How's it going?

129
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,920
Oh. Gin and tonic there.

130
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,400
You're fancy now.

131
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,080
Quarantine
has really done you good.

132
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,320
Oh, it's delish.
Hang on.

133
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,600
I'll come inside.
The signal's...

134
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,240
Yes.Just living the life
by the pool.

135
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,240
- Oh, no.
- Oh, come on.

136
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,840
- Bye, Ginny!
- Bye!

137
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,200
Oh, my God.

138
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,280
You coming on your own, Ted?

139
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,160
Uh, yes.
Big boy stuff.

140
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,040
I'm all by myself
with you lot.

141
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,640
- Aw.
- You got a little man-bun going.

142
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,880
When did you get a man-bun?

143
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,120
I think it's a twat knot
from corona.

144
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,560
Shall I give you
a little tour around?

145
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Yes, please.Hang on.

146
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Check this guy out.

147
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,480
Oh.

148
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,000
- Very creepy.
- So creepy.

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,240
Yeah, what the fuck?

150
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,880
You literally
have no fucking idea

151
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,760
how close this thing is.
Yeah, let's check out the...

152
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,080
Is that a bar behind you?

153
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.
Yeah, it is.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,080
The fucking hardest thing
is not getting cunted

155
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,240
in front of her dad.
There's so much booze here,

156
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,800
and yes, it's not exactly
like I can bring out

157
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,840
Red Ted from the '99 days.

158
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,320
Oh, Red Ted.

159
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,920
But it's weird being with her
and her parents.

160
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,280
They've got these weird rules,
like --

161
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,040
like, no Pornhub
in the dining room, and, uh...

162
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,840
How are you surviving? Barely.

163
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,400
Barely.
I'm a man on the edge.

164
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,720
I'm a man on the edge.

165
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Ted, how are you feeling
about tonight?

166
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,400
Do you have your item? I do.

167
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,080
Yeah, yeah, I've got it.

168
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,880
Bro, this is how seriously
I'm taking this fucking thing.

169
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,240
I went home to --
I broke quarantine

170
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,840
to go and get this, so...

171
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,000
You?
I'm telling.

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,680
I'll make this as atmospheric
as I can.

173
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,240
- Ooh.
- Wow. Oh, my God.

174
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,400
Fuckin' creepy.
You hear it?

175
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,040
Yeah.
Yes.

176
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,440
So, basically, it was --
it's my nan's, but I fucking --

177
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,200
I literally fucking hate this,
'cause my brother --

178
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,560
he used to be
a right little shit.

179
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,280
He'd go and hide it around
the house,

180
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,280
and it used to scare
the shit out of me.

181
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,960
I genuinely used to cry.

182
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,880
To be honest, when I hear
that music, it's um...

183
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,160
ooh!
It's fuckin' horrible.

184
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,880
It's horrible.
So, this -- this is his.

185
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,240
God bless him.
If it's playing, watch out.

186
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,800
That is so creepy. Sorry.
That is...

187
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,920
Are you not looking forward
to it?

188
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,080
I'm a bit nervous.

189
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm absolutely
shitting here.

190
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,600
Why?

191
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,680
I really don't
want to do it.

192
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,760
It'll be fine.

193
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,160
The woman is a friend of mine,

194
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,880
so she's done it
a bunch of times for me.

195
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,280
She'll kind of guide
everybody through it.

196
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,080
You kind of just have to
follow her instructions.

197
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,480
Just, please,
she is a friend of mine.

198
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,800
Not that I don't think
you would,

199
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,240
but please take it seriously,
though,

200
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,080
and be respectful.

201
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,120
Speaking of seriously,

202
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,480
and not to undermine
everything you've just said,

203
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,720
but can we do a, uh...
cheeky little shot

204
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,560
every time
she says "astroplane".

205
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,680
Yes!
It's my game!

206
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,240
Astral plane.

207
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,600
Astral plane.
Not "astro".

208
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
"Astral".Vodka bottle right here.

209
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,240
Just don't let her see.

210
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't know if she'll be o--
like, cool with that.

211
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,880
Oh, while you guys
are killing your livers,

212
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,320
I'm gonna drink water.That's just --

213
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,440
if we're gonna do the shots,
do it slightly...

214
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,160
I mean, I can't really do that
with a beer.

215
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,800
Alright, let's, uh...
let's do a shot guys.

216
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,480
To us.
It's fuckin' nice to see you.

217
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,120
Here, take a picture.

218
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,080
Brought this guy back out.

219
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,160
Aww.What should we toast to?

220
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,480
A, uh...

221
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,200
a happy -- happy seance?

222
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,920
Yeah.Happy spookies.

223
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,720
Happy spookies.

224
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,480
Okay, everyone, get in.

225
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,320
Three, two, one.

226
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,880
Cheers.
Cheers.

227
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,680
Cheers, guys.

228
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,120
Whoa.Oh, she just texted me.

229
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,400
What's it called when you,
like, send something --

230
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,080
something?
Telepathy.

231
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,120
Did she text you
with telepathy?

232
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,640
Tele-- Telethapy?

233
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,640
So, she actually texted me.

234
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,280
Oh.
With the phone.What's she saying?

235
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,640
She's in the waiting room.Ooh.

236
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,960
Scared!

237
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,480
Why are you making me do this?

238
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,640
Can't we just do, like,
I don't know.

239
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,080
A board game or something?

240
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,840
Nothing's gonna happen.

241
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,120
Exactly!

242
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,640
Oh, Teddy!

243
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,200
Teddy, keep that shut, please.

244
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,000
Alright, I'm gonna let her in.
Everybody ready?

245
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,200
- Yes.
- No.

246
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,520
Let's do this.

247
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,360
Ha!
I'm joking.

248
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,960
Please. Remember,
be respectful, everybody.

249
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,280
I'm gonna let her into the room.

250
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,440
Hi, Seylan.

251
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,480
Hi.
Can you hear me?

252
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,880
- Yeah.
- Hi.

253
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,760
Hi, Haley.
How are you doing?

254
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,960
Hi, everybody.Nice to meet you.

255
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,400
Nice to meet you, too.

256
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,600
Thanks so much
for inviting me along.

257
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,840
I've got to confess --

258
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,520
I've never done this
before over Zoom.

259
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,680
So, it's gonna be new for all
of us, which should be fun.

260
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,560
Um... now, did Haley mention to
you about trigger objects?

261
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,080
That's something
you might have, um...

262
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,040
that's closely connected
with somebody

263
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,400
that you might want
to speak to this evening.

264
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,280
You've all got something?
- Yeah.

265
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,920
- Good. - Yep.
- Can I ask -- Sorry.

266
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,600
Can I ask a question?
If my pa--

267
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,120
my grandparents
are Chinese and I am English

268
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,280
and I don't speak Chinese,
does that mean

269
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,880
that I will not be able
to communicate with them?

270
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,240
No. Not at all.

271
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,080
There's no language
on the astral plane,

272
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,720
so if they want
to communicate with you,

273
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,880
then they will let
you understand.

274
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,040
Okay.This might sound
really silly,

275
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,200
but can I potentially
contact a dead pet?

276
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,840
Yeah. Absolutely.

277
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,480
Like I said, on the astral
plane, there's no language.

278
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,440
If you bear in mind
that the laws are different

279
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,080
from what they are here,

280
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,160
so you might be able
to talk to a pet.

281
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,320
Yeah, absolutely.Can we light these now?

282
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,800
Yes.
Go ahead and light your candles.

283
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,080
Yep. The candle is going to be
our guiding focus

284
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,720
and it's going to
encourage the spirit.

285
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,640
It will give them almost
a beacon to come towards.

286
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,080
So, what I want you
to look out for

287
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,840
are the kind of response
that you might get from spirit,

288
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,000
and it might be a name
or a face,

289
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,080
an image that comes
into your mind,

290
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,040
but it can also be
physical things,

291
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,000
like you might hear a knock

292
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,440
or you might see
your candle light flicker.

293
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,160
You could feel a touch, feel
pressure on your body somewhere.

294
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,000
That's the kind of thing
that I want you to look out for.

295
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,880
Very quickly, before we start,
what was the name of that plane?

296
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,280
The astral plane.

297
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,600
Oh, right, right.

298
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,080
So, because we're doing this
over Zoom,

299
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,400
what it does mean is that
we're slightly less

300
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,080
protected
than we might have been,

301
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,520
so it's very important
that you respect the spirits

302
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,000
and you respect each other.

303
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,320
Is anybody feeling worried?

304
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,080
Does anybody...

305
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,160
anybody feeling a bit
vulnerable?

306
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,360
Yeah, Emma and Caroline.
Okay.

307
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
So, let me just quickly talk you
through a process

308
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,960
that you can do any time,

309
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,160
and normally, we would be
in a circle, holding hands,

310
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,680
with one candle in the center.

311
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,360
Because we're all...

312
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,640
not in the same place,

313
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,040
we're going to
visualize the circle.

314
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,560
We're going to visualize
ourselves

315
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,880
breaking that circle,

316
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,560
and then as
an extra precaution,

317
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,280
I'd like you to visualize a cord
or a rope around your waist

318
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,880
that's leading
towards your front door,

319
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,240
and then visualize yourself
cutting with

320
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,680
a knife or scissors,
whatever you like.

321
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,080
Just make a real
for yourself,

322
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,040
and that will sever
the connection

323
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,640
with the spirit realm.

324
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,880
Okay. Um, I'm gonna switch on
some isochronic tones,

325
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,240
and they just
help our energy

326
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,480
to join the vibrations
of the spirit realm.

327
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,600
Okay.
Now, close your eyes.

328
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,000
And I'd like you just
to visualize that circle.

329
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,880
Holy shit! What are you doing?

330
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,200
Knock it off, you shit.

331
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,360
Sorry, girls.

332
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,520
Hey.

333
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,840
What?

334
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,480
Teddy.

335
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,680
- Ted.
- Sorry, Ted's got to go.

336
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,720
Bye.Are you serious?

337
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,400
- Wow.
- Did he just leave?

338
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Such a fucking knobsack.She's a bitch.

339
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,560
In the span of
like two minutes.

340
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,280
Listen, d-don't worry.

341
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,080
Let's not let this affect us.

342
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,160
Let's just maintain our focus.

343
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,600
Um, obviously, we're not here
physically together,

344
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,280
but there's no reason why spirit
can't communicate with us

345
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,680
over the Internet.

346
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,920
Over the channel
of communication,

347
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
we could all be possessed.

348
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,480
Now --
- Possessed?

349
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,240
Don't be scared by that word.

350
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,640
That just means that the spirit
is communicating through us.

351
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,240
It's called "possessed",
but that doesn't

352
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,440
have to be a negative thing.
Just bear that in mind.

353
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,400
Now, I'd like you, please,
to visualize a circle.

354
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,920
Visualize us all together
in the one room,

355
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,280
sitting in a circle,

356
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,280
and we're just going to gently
join hands with each other.

357
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,880
Spirit, we invite you
to use us to pass

358
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,520
on any communication
you might have.

359
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,200
Is there anyone there?
Please come forward.

360
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,800
And all together.

361
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,840
Is there anyone there?
Please come forward.

362
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,880
Okay.

363
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,960
Now, I want you to tell me if
anything comes into your mind.

364
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,640
Perhaps a name, a face.

365
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,640
If you hear any sounds.

366
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,560
Radina, I don't want to
make you nervous, but...

367
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,720
can anybody something
going on just behind.

368
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,880
Yeah, looks like a light
moving about.

369
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,480
Yeah. But I'm kind of noticing
something in between.

370
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,280
Probably just a reflection
of something.

371
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,560
There's a light on my fridge.
Um...

372
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,400
It's moving, though.No.

373
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,000
This -- This is something
different.

374
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,720
It was a light that was static,
and it's now moving.

375
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,880
- It's moving quite a lot.
- Yeah.

376
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,680
- I don't like it.
- Oh, I think --

377
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,920
Oh, hold on.
Hold on.

378
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,760
I can make it a third eye.

379
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,840
Okay,
it's on her face now.

380
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,360
What was that?

381
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,080
- Haley, was that you?
- It wasn't.

382
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,880
I didn't do anything.

383
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,520
Did it --
Did everybody hear that?

384
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,440
I heard it.
I heard something.

385
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,920
Okay,
let's just listen out.

386
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,720
Um, spirit, if you're trying
to give us a sign,

387
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,080
please knock
one more time.

388
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,200
Fuck.

389
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,480
Oh, I'm so sorry.
That must be my delivery.

390
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,320
I'm really sorry.
I'll be back in a second.

391
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,120
Oh.

392
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,000
- Oh!
- What?!

393
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,480
Oh, my God.I'm sorry.
"That's my Ocado."

394
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,040
"Sorry, my food delivery's
arrived."

395
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,560
I'm getting a noise.
Um...

396
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,800
I'm getting aubergines
Um...

397
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,080
a jar of tahini.

398
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,920
Is anybody else
getting something?

399
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,800
No, I just hear my next-door
neighbors.

400
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,680
- Is she coming back?
- Where is she?

401
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,280
Her house is kind of creepy
in the dark.

402
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,160
Seylan?

403
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,400
We paying her, Haley?

404
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,000
- Oh, there she is.
- She's back.

405
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,840
Hey, guys.
I'm really sorry.

406
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,480
Sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

407
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,640
It was supposed to arrive
before our session,

408
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
so sorry about that.

409
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,760
Can we get back
to where we were?

410
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,600
Yeah.

411
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,280
So, let's just focus
a little bit more.

412
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,760
Is anybody getting a name,
perhaps?

413
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,600
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.Did anybody see that?

414
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,760
Okay,
what just happened?

415
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,320
I felt, like, a hand
on my -- on my shoulder.

416
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,920
Jemma?

417
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,520
- Jemma, are you okay?
- What was it?

418
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,880
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

419
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,520
Something just touched my neck.

420
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,240
Jemma, do you want to come
and talk to us?

421
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,880
Um...

422
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,720
Just try asking
some questions, Jemma.

423
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,760
Honestly, the pressure on
my neck is almost unbearable.

424
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,680
Do you want to call out
and ask who it is?

425
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,520
Maybe a name might come
into your head, or...

426
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,600
Hello?

427
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,880
Is there...

428
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,480
Is there someone there?

429
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,600
Oh.

430
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,360
The name Jack's come to mind.

431
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,280
Okay.

432
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
That's good.

433
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,840
Do you know anyone called
Jack who's passed?

434
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,480
Yeah.

435
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,640
A kid from school.

436
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,080
He was really nice
to me one time.

437
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,000
I cracked my head open...

438
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,720
and he, like, picked me up.

439
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,440
He hanged himself.

440
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,760
Listen, Jemma,
I want you to --

441
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,320
Where did Seylan go?

442
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,440
It might just be
a bad connection.

443
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,520
- You, uh... Call her, Haley.
- Yeah.

444
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,480
Jemma -- Jemma,
you alright?

445
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,880
You okay, Jemma?

446
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,240
Oh, my God.Haley: What?

447
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,920
You bitch.
No.

448
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,440
- You didn't.
- Oh, no.

449
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,880
- Oh, my God.
- Jemma.

450
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
Did you make that up?

451
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,080
Jemma, you're a psychopath.

452
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,280
Nothing was happening.

453
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,160
Jemma, I believed you.

454
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,800
I'm so -- I'm so sorry.

455
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,680
There was just nothing
being said.

456
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,840
I actually thought you were
gonna, like, die.

457
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,640
Have we heard from Seylan?

458
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,360
Yeah, is she okay?
What happened?

459
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,640
I didn't even see
what happened.

460
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,280
Her Internet went out.
I'm gonna pee.

461
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,440
Yeah. I might,
too, actually.

462
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,440
I'm gonna be smashed
if we carry this on.

463
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,080
Some water.

464
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,440
Ready, Haley?
Yep.

465
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,200
Oh, wait.

466
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,520
I'm sensing some...

467
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,240
tension.

468
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,680
But -- A name's just
come to mind.

469
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,280
Haley.

470
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,600
Haley.

471
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,760
Haley!

472
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,680
Fuck off, Jemma.

473
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,480
- Oh.
- Oh.

474
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,960
Haley just can't have fun.

475
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,480
You're not taking it
seriously like I asked you to.

476
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,000
Oh, shut up.
I'm so bored of this.

477
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,440
Oh, my God.

478
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,440
Why do we have to do this
tonight, guys?

479
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,760
You know what, Jemma?
Nobody -- Aah!

480
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,920
H-Haley, what's going on?

481
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,480
Oh, fuck.

482
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,520
Haley?

483
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,120
I think there's
something here.

484
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,800
Haley, stop fucking about,
please.

485
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,760
I swear, it wasn't --
Look.

486
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,200
I -- We have
to keep going.

487
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,840
- No.
- Please --

488
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,600
We connected with something.
We got to keep going.

489
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,880
We got to talk to it.
I'm gonna call out.

490
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,000
No. No.Is anybody here?

491
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,200
Does anyone want
to talk to me?

492
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,240
Turn your lights off.Haley, honestly, if I die,

493
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,800
I'm actually gonna
haunt you myself.

494
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,240
Shh. Just listen. Shh!

495
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,120
I heard something.

496
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,880
Turn your microphones up.

497
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,040
Should be under settings.

498
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,800
Is anybody here?

499
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,280
I don't like this.

500
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,040
What was that?

501
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,640
I heard something.

502
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,240
That wasn't in my house.

503
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,040
Caroline.

504
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,120
Caroline.
You got to go check it out.

505
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,520
Don't do that.

506
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,160
That's a stupid idea.

507
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,280
There's probably nothing there.
It's okay.

508
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,880
Dad?

509
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,480
What is it?

510
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,920
It's probably nothing.

511
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,560
Be careful.

512
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,040
Caroline, take us up.

513
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,520
It's okay.

514
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,800
Go on, Caroline.
It's okay.

515
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,520
It'll be fine.

516
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,600
No. No.

517
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,120
What are you doing,
Caroline?

518
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,440
Caroline,
what are you doing?

519
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,000
It's gonna be fine.

520
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,160
Go on, Caroline.
It's okay.

521
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,320
It's okay.
We're here.

522
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,720
Film what you see.

523
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,440
Do you see anything?

524
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,400
- What's that thing?
- Nothing, it's just focusing.

525
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,840
Nothing's there.
It's fine.

526
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,520
Look, look.

527
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,400
- Caroline, go back.
- What the fuck was that?

528
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,320
- What the fuck was that?
- I don't see anything.

529
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,480
Caroline, go down.
Caroline.

530
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,040
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out.

531
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,800
- What was it?
- What the fuck was that?

532
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,040
I definitely just
saw something.

533
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,640
You have to call Seylan.
Call Seylan.

534
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,600
Yeah, yeah. Just calm down.
Calm down.

535
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,720
I'm gonna call her.
I'm gonna call her.

536
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,160
I'm calling her.

537
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,120
Haley? What are you doing?

538
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,480
Haley. Haley.

539
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,440
Do you see that?

540
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,640
No. What?

541
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,520
I can't see anything?

542
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,600
It's not in there.

543
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,240
Haley, what is it?

544
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,440
It looked at me.

545
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,360
No.

546
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,560
What is that?

547
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,560
What the fuck?

548
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,640
What the fuck, guys?

549
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,560
This is not funny anymore.
Stop taking the piss.

550
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,880
Call Seylan.

551
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,640
It's ringing, it's ringing.
It's ringing.

552
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,160
Hello? Seylan?

553
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,480
H-Haley?

554
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,800
Haley, is that you? Yeah.

555
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,400
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

556
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,440
My Internet --
it's a bit of a --

557
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,880
Sorry, I've not been able
to get it going.

558
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
How's it going? We've had some --

559
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,280
We've had some interesting
experiences.

560
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,080
We've just --
Caroline's just a bit scared,

561
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,560
so we're just hoping
you can talk us through.

562
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,920
Okay. Yeah.
No -- No problem.

563
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,000
I mean, it's -- it's --
it's good

564
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,560
that you've had an experience.

565
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,360
That's what we're here for.
I'm really sorry

566
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,040
that I've not been there
to go through it with you,

567
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,920
but can the others hear me? Yeah, they can hear you.

568
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,440
They can hear you. Oh, they can hear me.
Okay.

569
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,880
Listen, guys, don't worry.

570
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,240
So, just --
let's just keep calm.

571
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,800
It's probably just --

572
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,880
just somebody trying
to pass on a message.

573
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,880
Jemma, you were telling us
about your friend, Jack.

574
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,160
So, it sounds pretty likely
that it's him.

575
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:40,200
Have you tried asking
if it's Jack?

576
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,320
I don't know. Jemma, have we
tried asking if it's Jack?

577
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,120
Eh...

578
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,320
Jemma!

579
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,720
Sorry.

580
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,360
Jack's not real.

581
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,960
What's going on?
Wait.Jack's not real.

582
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,560
Jemma made him up.

583
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,600
Jack doesn't --
Jack doesn't e-exist or --

584
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,280
or Jack does exist.
She just didn't hear him?

585
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,480
No, Jack doesn't
exist at all.

586
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,280
Look, guys, I...

587
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
I told you not to disrespect
the spirits.

588
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,680
This -- This isn't good.
This is not good.

589
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,960
I mean, basically, if --
by inventing a-a person

590
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,720
that doesn't exist,
we've basically

591
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,960
summoned a false spirit.

592
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,440
If you made this person up,
you -- you basically created --

593
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,520
Imagine, like,
you created a mask,

594
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,880
so now anything can come
through and wear that mask.

595
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,440
We -- We don't know
what it might be.

596
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,640
So... I mean, if we're lucky,
it's just --

597
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,080
it's just another spirit.

598
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,400
But what if --
what if we're not lucky, though?

599
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,920
H-Haley, ask her what if
we're not lucky.

600
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,800
What if we're not lucky,
Seylan?

601
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,240
Um...

602
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,280
I-It could be something...

603
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,960
demonic.

604
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,080
Look, I mean, basically,
Jemma has sent out

605
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,280
an invitation,
an open invitation.

606
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,680
We need to shut this down.

607
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,640
We need to --
Like I said to you.

608
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,680
We need to thank the spirits
and close it down,

609
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,480
and don't forget that --
visualizing that rope.

610
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,840
Okay?
So, um...

611
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,120
spirit, please give us
one knock for "yes"

612
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,280
and two knocks for "no".

613
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,000
Let's ask, "Do you have
a message for us?"

614
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,200
After three.
So, one, two, three.

615
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,720
Do you have a message for us?

616
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,240
My light just turned on.

617
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,680
Okay, Haley, that's great.

618
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,040
Let's -- Okay.

619
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,480
Um...

620
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,000
let's try another question.

621
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,520
Um...

622
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,040
all together, let's ask,
"Are you a friend?"

623
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,840
One, two, three.

624
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,600
Are you a friend?

625
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,040
Aah!

626
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,720
Seylan?
Are you there?

627
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,280
What the fuck is going on?!

628
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,880
Call her back.
Call her back now.

629
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,320
Fuck.
Fuck, she's not picking up.

630
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,160
Okay. Okay.

631
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,320
What do we do? What do we do?
What do we do? What do we do?

632
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,320
What do we do? Just a second.
I know what to do.

633
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,080
Okay, we just have to do the --
the rope thing and --

634
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,920
and we have to be polite
to the spirit --

635
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,000
You don't know
what you're doing! Just shut up, Jemma!

636
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,280
Just shut the fuck up
for one second!

637
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,160
Imagine a rope. Imagine the rope
around your waist,

638
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,480
rope around your waist.

639
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,320
Okay.
I'm sorry, spirit.

640
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,080
I'm sorry if
we confused you.

641
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,480
Just repeat after me.
I'm sorry if we confused you.

642
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,080
Sorry if we confused you.

643
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,520
Um, imagine the rope
to your door,

644
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,800
and then we're just
gonna cut the rope.

645
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,680
Okay? Okay, imagine
we're cutting the rope.

646
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,280
Okay.
I'm gonna call out again.

647
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,920
Is there anyone here?

648
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,000
And then, um, open your eyes
and blow out the candles

649
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,600
and that'll break
the circle.

650
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,320
I blew my candle already out.

651
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,200
It's okay.
It's okay.

652
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,240
Just remember, she said it was
just to guide them there,

653
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,480
so it's okay.

654
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,240
Bless you.

655
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,640
What the fuck?

656
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,920
That was...
It was exciting.

657
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,920
Oh, my God.
I'm so hot.

658
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,000
I-I smell so bad.

659
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,520
I'm really sweaty.

660
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,000
Oh, my God.
Whew.

661
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Guys, what
the fuck was that?

662
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,560
- Oh, God.
- Never again.

663
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,440
Radina,
are you on the toilet?

664
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,960
Maybe.

665
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,480
Panic wee.

666
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,000
Guys, I'm not going anywhere
alone after what just happened.

667
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,880
Shut up.

668
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,000
You okay, Caroline?

669
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,040
Fuckin' hell.
That gave me a shock.

670
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,720
Ugh.

671
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,920
Guys, I'm literally not going
to sleep tonight now.

672
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,440
Crazy, guys.
Fuckin' hell.

673
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,040
Emma, your glass.

674
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,320
I swear to God.
I didn't do anything.

675
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,640
That was an expensive one.

676
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,040
Wait until Teddy hears
about this.

677
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,240
He's just sitting there
eating his Chinese

678
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,760
and we've nearly died.

679
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,880
Oh, my God.
I can't wait to tell Teddy.

680
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,400
He's gonna be, like,
all flustered.

681
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,560
He'll come back and we're just
gonna be like,

682
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,440
"Mate, you've just
missed a storm."

683
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,880
Guys, did anybody see
Allen leaving?

684
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,040
He left his phone.

685
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,320
Where is...

686
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,760
Radina, has he gone
to the shop to do...

687
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,760
Maybe he's at his brother's.

688
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,200
Here, give him a call.

689
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,680
Crap. I've actually finished
the whole bottle of wine.

690
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,120
Um...
guys, I think I'm gonna head...

691
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,440
This has been, um...

692
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,120
Emma, my darling.

693
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,240
Goodbye, my dear.I love you.

694
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,760
Goodbye. Farewell.
So long.

695
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,920
See you later.Bye, Haley.

696
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,080
Bye, girls.
See you next time.

697
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,240
Can you say goodbye
to Radina for me, please?

698
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,080
Um...
yeah, I mean,

699
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,960
maybe we should wait
until she gets back.

700
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,680
Oh, no,
