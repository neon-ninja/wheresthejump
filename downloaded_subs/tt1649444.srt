00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:39,342
A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY

2
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,717
Okay. We're going to film
my cousin Koldo,

3
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:37,383
who I’m sure is a little nervous.

4
00:01:37,592 --> 00:01:38,633
Auntie!

5
00:01:39,383 --> 00:01:41,258
Koldo? Koldo?

6
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:43,508
- Congratulations
- Thanks.

7
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:44,717
Cousin!

8
00:01:45,508 --> 00:01:47,175
Hey!

9
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,008
- What's up, Cousin?
- How are you?

10
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:50,675
- Great. What about you?
- Well... Can't you tell?

11
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:52,717
You're great! You look great!

12
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,092
And no rice...

13
00:01:55,258 --> 00:01:57,633
No, don't throw rice.
The girl wants rose petals.

14
00:01:57,925 --> 00:01:59,050
- How refined
- Come on, give us a hand!

15
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:02,008
- Koldo! Koldito!
- Hey!

16
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:05,050
What are you doing lurking
around here?

17
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:06,633
Hey, do you remember
my cousin Adrián?

18
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:10,092
Of course I do. But the last time
I saw you, you were only knee high.

19
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,008
Hey, if you film any good-looking girls,
tell me, okay?

20
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:17,550
Speaking of the devil...
ls Natalie coming?

21
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:19,800
But aren’t you even going to
give it a rest on my wedding day?

22
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:21,842
- But is she coming or not?
- She's already inside.

23
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,092
Perfect!

24
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:25,342
Hey, who.... Who's Natalie?

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,467
Natalié, Natalié...
Ales enfants de la patrie.

26
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:33,800
Let's see. Look over there Okay...

27
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:36,258
Look, the wedding video man!
Nice equipment!

28
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:40,383
Hey, what's this for?

29
00:02:40,592 --> 00:02:44,800
That's for stabilising the image and
creating cinema-quality movements.

30
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:47,883
Otherwise, with all this stuff on your
shoulder, the picture is unwatchable.

31
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:49,967
Do they shoot films with this, too?

32
00:02:50,175 --> 00:02:51,967
Here, some of them
In America, all of them

33
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,550
All of them?

34
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:57,717
Look, look, look, look.
Cinema quality.

35
00:02:57,925 --> 00:02:59,925
And what about your camera, kid?

36
00:03:00,383 --> 00:03:03,550
This one's got high-definition HD
with megapixels.

37
00:03:03,758 --> 00:03:06,342
With megapixels?
Hey, can you do me a favour?

38
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:09,633
Could you get some shots inside,
being as how you’re family?

39
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:11,592
Yeah, I’m going to film everything,
no worries.

40
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,175
Film what the naked eye wouldn't see.
Dziga Vertov, Cinema verité...

41
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:17,383
Yeah, of course.
I swear to God I’ll film everything.

42
00:03:17,508 --> 00:03:19,800
- What's your name, sunshine?
- Adrián. And you?

43
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:22,175
- Atún.
- Okay. Pleased to meet you

44
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:27,967
Tita, put your cardigan on,
we're going.

45
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,842
See you later, Estela.

46
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,217
- Have you got your keys?
- Yes, dear, don’t worry

47
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:43,550
And where’s Clara?

48
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:45,550
Well, she's not upstairs
I don’t know

49
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,675
- What do you mean, she's not upstairs?
- No.

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,217
Go and look for your sister
in the kitchen.

51
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,300
No, this way

52
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:52,842
And put that camera away!

53
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:53,717
Oh...

54
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:57,175
Clara! Clara!

55
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:00,925
Clara, we're leaving!

56
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,883
Are you all right?

57
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:14,883
Tita, switch off the camera.
I’ve got something to tell you.

58
00:04:16,383 --> 00:04:16,925
I think..

59
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,092
Bye!

60
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,758
Here's Koldo with uncle Pepe Víctor.

61
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:23,008
Let's see what he’s got to say.
He's always stirring it.

62
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:25,258
Clara's great. If you change your mind,
I’ll divorce your aunt...

63
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:27,217
- ...and steal her from you.
- What are you talking about!

64
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:30,800
Well, that's great, Uncle.
Viva Valencia!

65
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,550
- Víctor, Pepe Víctor!
- I’m coming, Amparín, I’m coming!

66
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:37,592
Hey, Uncle, what happened
to your hand?

67
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,842
Don't say anything to your aunt.
A dog in the clinic...

68
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,883
- It looked like it was dead...
- What happened?

69
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:46,967
And it woke up and bam!
He just made a right mess of it

70
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:49,717
- You mean it bit you?
- Yeah, but don’t worry, I’m..

71
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:52,842
- Are you all right?
- Can't you tell? Eh?

72
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:55,508
- Come on! Pepe Víctor, let's go!
- I’ve got a little something for you.

73
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:57,550
- I’ll come and find you later, okay?
- Yeah, yeah...

74
00:04:58,467 --> 00:04:59,342
Give it to me.

75
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,675
I like filming.

76
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:03,717
Yeah...

77
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:07,758
Well, she's a bit nervous, of course.

78
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:12,425
But she's really beautiful.
You should see her.

79
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,592
All right.

80
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:18,925
She's coming. Come on, she's on her way
Everybody inside!

81
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,550
Come on, Koldo. Chin up!
Be brave!

82
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:21,550
Come on, get inside!

83
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:25,092
- Come on, inside!
- Come on, get moving!

84
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:27,758
- Where is he? Where's my father?
- Your father’s inside.

85
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:29,675
- With Mónica, Óscar and the kids.
- Okay, okay, come on...

86
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:32,050
Come on. Come on, let's go!
Everybody inside!

87
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:33,050
Go get'em!

88
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,675
At the back!
Come on, let's get inside

89
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,675
- Do you want one, Adri?
- No. No, thanks.

90
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,342
Rafa!

91
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:43,425
Hey! The boys are here!
Ha ha!

92
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,592
And the fool who's getting married?
Where's he got to, mate?

93
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:48,050
He's inside.
Where do you think?

94
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:49,800
Hey, kid!

95
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:51,092
Hey Rafita...

96
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,258
So good-looking...

97
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:55,258
Hey Charly! Inside!
Give us a hug!

98
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:57,092
There... Jumangi!

99
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,383
You're gorgeous!

100
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:48,092
And so, as you wish to enter
into matrimony, join hands...

101
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:57,258
Clara, take this ring, as a sign of
my love and my fidelity to you...

102
00:07:00,217 --> 00:07:06,133
Koldo, take this ring, as a sign of
my love and my fidelity to you...

103
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,258
Oh...

104
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:36,383
You've been tangled up with me
for years in my hands, my hair,

105
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:38,883
in my head...

106
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:41,300
And I can't do it any more

107
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:45,967
I can't do it any more

108
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:50,633
I should be tired of
your hands, your hair

109
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:53,425
your strange ways

110
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,258
but I want more

111
00:07:57,425 --> 00:08:00,508
I want more.

112
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:04,133
I can't live without you.

113
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:08,300
There's no way

114
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:12,383
I can’t be with out you.

115
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:16,883
No way, oh...

116
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,050
You're gorgeous!

117
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:34,175
Long live the happy couple!

118
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:35,050
Viva!

119
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:40,383
Well done, son!

120
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:05,467
Photo!

121
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,717
And now the family!

122
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:15,133
Uncle, Uncle, Uncle...

123
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,883
Granddad, how are you?
How are you?

124
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:23,842
- Okay, so you're going...
- Are you happy?

125
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:25,258
Oh, yes!

126
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:26,217
Your hearing aid!

127
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,258
Can you hear me?
Granddad!

128
00:09:29,383 --> 00:09:30,092
Are you hearing?

129
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:42,592
Can I have your attention, please?

130
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:46,717
The buses for the reception are
behind the church.

131
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:51,883
So, there's room for everyone,
but little by little.

132
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,383
Let's not all get there at once,
okay?

133
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:57,133
Okay, thanks.

134
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:02,008
Look at them!
You're going to look so cute!

135
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:03,800
Have you seen your brother?

136
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:06,342
Hey, kid, have you seen your brother?

137
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:09,050
The kid's just got married
and he's already sneaking off?

138
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:11,133
Unbelievable!

139
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:13,508
There's such a lot of people here!

140
00:10:15,592 --> 00:10:19,467
Well, we're at the reception,
in this marvellous place...

141
00:10:25,717 --> 00:10:27,675
This must have cost them a fortune!

142
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,008
Hi, beautiful.
How are you?

143
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,758
- No alcohol?
- No, it's alcohol free.

144
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,133
- No alcohol?
- No alcohol.

145
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:37,633
- What is it?
- Piña colada.

146
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:40,217
- Piña colada? I’ll have one!
- He knows it!

147
00:10:40,342 --> 00:10:42,008
- I’ll have one!
- All right!

148
00:10:43,758 --> 00:10:45,633
Mother and daughter!

149
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,592
Well, the mother's bit of a MILF,
isn't she?

150
00:10:54,342 --> 00:10:55,592
- Granddad?
- Yes?

151
00:10:55,717 --> 00:11:00,508
- They said it was going to rain, eh?
- Yes. When I went to school...

152
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:03,050
That hasn’t got much to do
with anything, but yeah..

153
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:05,008
I missed...

154
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:08,175
I was saying how pretty your mother
is... but you..

155
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,383
- Yeah, come on...
- It's getting better...

156
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:14,175
Bye.

157
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,592
Atún!

158
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,550
Cinema quality, mate!

159
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:19,925
There, there...

160
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:22,633
That guy's really good!

161
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:24,717
It has to be edited...

162
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:28,467
with a touch of fresco,
a touch of Renoir...

163
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:30,925
a pinch of cinema verité...

164
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:31,717
Yeah, yeah, right...

165
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:35,633
- Very down to earth, very online.
- Online?

166
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:39,508
Uncle... are you all right?

167
00:11:42,342 --> 00:11:43,842
- Yes.
- Yeah?

168
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:48,508
Look at the love birds

169
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:54,383
- I’m really happy, very happy.
- Me too.

170
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:56,383
No. What you are is really pretty.

171
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,883
- I want to tell you something.
- Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.

172
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:03,300
But you’re so pretty...

173
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:05,258
I mean, you're usually pretty,
but today..?

174
00:12:05,383 --> 00:12:06,383
Right..

175
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:08,467
Sorry.

176
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:12,383
This morning, at my parent's house...

177
00:12:12,508 --> 00:12:13,758
Hey!

178
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,883
Gorgeous!

179
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:08,425
Well, thanks to everyone
for being here, and...

180
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,383
I don’t know.. Koldo and I...

181
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:16,092
Koldo and I love you lots and...

182
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:20,842
it's great to see that you love us
so much and that you're happy

183
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,550
that we’ve found the loves
of our lives.

184
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:24,633
Bravo!

185
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:35,092
That's lovely. That's lovely.
That's lovely...

186
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:45,717
I want a bit!

187
00:13:51,258 --> 00:13:53,092
Get us!

188
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:54,092
There... there...

189
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:56,383
Long live the happy couple.
We love you lots...

190
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:57,467
And for love!

191
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:00,425
Pour l'amour. Pour l'amour.

192
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:04,550
Rafa!
Pour l'amour.

193
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:05,633
Oh, oh!

194
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:09,508
She's stood you up!
She's stood you up!

195
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:11,258
She came, she came...

196
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,717
She got confused and she's gone!

197
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:16,758
- She got away from you!
- For la France...

198
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:18,883
Natalié... Natalié...

199
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:21,800
Ales enfants de la patríe.

200
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:24,800
That's where I want it.

201
00:14:24,925 --> 00:14:27,550
Hey! Gorgeous!

202
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,342
Hey, Koldito!

203
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:37,092
Okay, cinema verité.

204
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:40,550
Let's continue our programme
with some interviews...

205
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,717
Here we have Sponge Bob...

206
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,592
Can I interview you?

207
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:49,175
Yes, but could we go outside?
I want to smoke a cigarette.

208
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,883
Okay, let's go outside.

209
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:54,133
There's a room next to the dining room,

210
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:55,800
where we put on games and shows

211
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:58,467
so that the kids are entertained
during the banquet.

212
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:00,883
And how long have you been
doing this?

213
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,425
Well, weddings, for about ten years...

214
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,592
and children's shows, eight.

215
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:10,800
And what exactly
are you dressed up as?

216
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:12,675
As Sponge John

217
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,633
That would be Sponge Bob?

218
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:17,842
No. Well, you see, there was
a copyright problem

219
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:20,383
and now the costume is called
Sponge John

220
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:23,383
We are talking about a character
that's got nothing to do with

221
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:26,258
the one you're talking about.
I don’t want any trouble later on.

222
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,550
I swear to God.

223
00:15:28,675 --> 00:15:31,925
Well, that's it. It’s really great.
Because the kids love it.

224
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,092
Fuck...
There goes the typical drunk!

225
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,967
That's my uncle!

226
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:41,008
- Oh, sorry kid, I didn’t know
- Uncle, are you all right?

227
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:44,383
Sorry, I didn’t know
he was your uncle.

228
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:47,550
What are those doing there?

229
00:15:57,883 --> 00:16:01,217
Once I heard
it was better to spray at night

230
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:02,383
How strange!

231
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:03,883
Have the cops arrived?

232
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:07,425
Oh, Uncle, if they breathalyse you...

233
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:08,717
Adrián!

234
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,092
I’ve just filmed my uncle Pepe Víctor
throwing up, man. It’s great!

235
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:14,508
Enough of Pepe,
enough crap and smokers.

236
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:17,675
Come inside and start
filming the good stuff.

237
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,592
You can’t rush..

238
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:35,092
You can’t rush things.

239
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:42,217
You can’t rush things...!
Come on, Rafa!

240
00:17:48,175 --> 00:17:49,967
Come on, Rafa!

241
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:51,092
Atún!

242
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,592
Atún!

243
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:55,967
I’ve just filmed Rafa getting off
with the Frenchwoman!

244
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,675
You were made for this, kid!

245
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,217
Oh! Yeah!

246
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,758
Uncle!

247
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:20,342
Uncle!

248
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:23,717
What are you doing?

249
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:25,967
Uncle!

250
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:27,925
Get down!

251
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,550
Uncle!

252
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:31,842
That's dangerous!

253
00:18:40,092 --> 00:18:41,550
Stop the music!

254
00:18:43,258 --> 00:18:44,467
Stop the music!

255
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:47,717
Call an ambulance!

256
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:50,217
Call an ambulance!
Please move!

257
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:53,550
Call an ambulance, come on!

258
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,175
An ambulance!

259
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:20,967
Have you seen Clara?
Have you seen Clara?

260
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:22,175
No?

261
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:23,842
Look, Tita is there!

262
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:25,425
Hey, come on!

263
00:20:32,508 --> 00:20:34,758
Follow me, Adrián!

264
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:38,925
This way! Koldo!

265
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:41,967
Get inside! And lock the door!

266
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:44,508
Lock the door!
It’s there!

267
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:46,508
Ah! God!

268
00:20:56,425 --> 00:20:59,467
Clara! Have you seen Clara?
Has anyone seen Clara?

269
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,467
No, I haven't seen her!

270
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:04,008
Jesus!

271
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:06,842
- What happened out there?
- I don’t know..

272
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:11,467
People went stark raving mad and
they just started eating each other.

273
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:14,425
- Are you filming?
- Yes, everything.

274
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:17,967
What are you doing?

275
00:21:18,092 --> 00:21:20,258
People have a right to
know what’s going on!

276
00:21:20,383 --> 00:21:21,925
I have to film everything!

277
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:27,383
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Stop! Stop!

278
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:28,800
- Give me the camera!
- Stop!

279
00:21:29,758 --> 00:21:30,633
You are going to..

280
00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:31,675
Break it!

281
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:06,508
You know you’re paying
for the camera, right?

282
00:22:20,342 --> 00:22:22,258
Try and call Clara, okay?

283
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,967
The stairs! Let's see if there’s an exit.
Come with me!

284
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:27,675
Come on, come on!

285
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,800
Get back, back!

286
00:22:32,925 --> 00:22:35,008
Lock the door!

287
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,925
- Well?
- I tried There's no cover.

288
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,925
I have to find Clara!
I have to find her!

289
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,425
That's not possible right now!

290
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:03,383
This is no time to act the crazy husband.
You see how fucked-up all this is.

291
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,092
Shit!

292
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:09,383
My name's Atún.
From Filmax films.

293
00:23:10,383 --> 00:23:11,925
Koldo.

294
00:23:12,842 --> 00:23:14,175
And this?

295
00:23:17,592 --> 00:23:19,550
My name's Moncho...

296
00:23:21,883 --> 00:23:23,967
What part of Clara's family
are you from, Moncho?

297
00:23:24,092 --> 00:23:26,133
He's not from my family.

298
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,633
SGAE Inspector.

299
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:31,550
What's that?

300
00:23:31,675 --> 00:23:33,883
I make a note of the songs played
at the wedding.

301
00:23:34,008 --> 00:23:35,758
For the royalties thing.

302
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:43,842
Hey, come here.
This grille must lead somewhere.

303
00:23:48,758 --> 00:23:49,467
Ah!

304
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:03,550
Go!

305
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,425
Go, go!

306
00:24:06,717 --> 00:24:11,175
Shit!
You fucking idiot, Royalties!

307
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:16,425
Hey, lads,
I think there's something over here!

308
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:20,258
Go on, go on...

309
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:25,467
Let me help you!

310
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:32,675
I’m not going to fit in there.

311
00:24:33,717 --> 00:24:35,425
We can’t leave here without Atún.

312
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,425
Don’t be so stupid.
Go on, get in!

313
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,133
We have to go! We have to go!

314
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:49,008
Here. I’ve put it on night-vision
so you can see inside there.

315
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:51,217
Don't even think about erasing
anything, eh?

316
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:58,175
Atún, I swear to God
we'll come back for you.

317
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:14,383
It’s dark!

318
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:15,425
I can't see a thing!

319
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,050
Cousin?

320
00:25:18,842 --> 00:25:21,217
Tita, here, take the camera!

321
00:25:21,342 --> 00:25:22,258
Come on!

322
00:25:34,175 --> 00:25:37,842
We don't know what's going on,
but everything will be all right.

323
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:40,717
We're going to find your sister and
we're going to get out of here, okay?

324
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:42,925
I promise.

325
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,300
Come on!
Come with me!

326
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:46,800
- Koldo!
- What’s wrong?

327
00:25:47,425 --> 00:25:51,758
When I was outside, I saw a police car.
We have to find it!

328
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:55,925
Come on, we have to get help,
no matter what!

329
00:25:56,592 --> 00:25:57,508
Shit!

330
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:01,758
Hey! Wait!
There is a light!

331
00:26:01,883 --> 00:26:03,758
I think.. I think I there’s a light.

332
00:26:05,842 --> 00:26:10,925
Maybe this leads to the garden.

333
00:26:53,717 --> 00:26:55,800
Come on! Come on!

334
00:27:01,883 --> 00:27:06,008

Hello? Please help us!
Can anyone hear me?

342
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:46,508
How the hell does this thing work?

00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:50,758
Please, can anyone hear me?

Come on!

348
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:25,842
I’m sorry.

00:30:28,383 --> 00:30:31,550
Get a move on!
What are you waiting for! Inside!

350
00:30:31,675 --> 00:30:32,633
Run, Grandma. Run!
Close it!

351
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:35,050
Shut up, wise guy.
They can't get in here.

352
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:39,092
Heretics! Bastards!

353
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:44,800
Clara!
Has anyone seen Clara?

354
00:30:45,508 --> 00:30:46,883
Does anyone have a mobile that works?

355
00:30:47,008 --> 00:30:49,008
None of them are working.

356
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:51,300
We've got to get these people
out of here!

357
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:52,800
We're safe in here, Grandma.

358
00:30:52,925 --> 00:30:53,758
Why don’t they come in?

359
00:30:53,883 --> 00:30:56,550
They can't set foot in the church,
and holy water hurts them.

360
00:30:56,675 --> 00:30:58,175
We don't know any more.

361
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,050
And I’m not your grandma, dear.

362
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:01,883
Is there a land line phone here?

363
00:31:02,008 --> 00:31:03,342
There is one, but it doesn’t work

364
00:31:11,717 --> 00:31:12,967
They seem to be going.

365
00:31:13,092 --> 00:31:15,633
Take the kids and get to the coaches,
all of you

366
00:31:15,758 --> 00:31:17,425
I’m going to find Clara.

367
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:21,758
- Wait, Koldo. We don't know if...
- No, don't say that. Shut up, okay?

368
00:31:21,883 --> 00:31:24,925
- Sir, remember that..
- Shut up! I don't want to hear it.

369
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,050
Koldo...

370
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:29,175
Clara is alive, I’m sure.

371
00:31:30,092 --> 00:31:32,467
I know, because I can sense her.

372
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,050
What the hell is that?

373
00:31:43,092 --> 00:31:44,508
Koldo.

374
00:31:45,258 --> 00:31:47,050
Koldo, it's me.

375
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:50,133
And I know that, wherever you are,
you can hear me.

376
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:51,925
I want to tell you that I’m all right.

377
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,467
Father Losara and me,
we've hidden and we’re okay.

378
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:57,258
And I know you’re okay, too.

379
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:59,967
I know you’re alive because
I can sense you, Koldo!

380
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:01,717
Baby!

381
00:32:01,842 --> 00:32:03,425
I love you!

382
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,258
And, well...

383
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,967
I’ve been trying to talk to you
all day, but...

384
00:32:09,092 --> 00:32:13,300
But we really haven’t had much time
to ourselves.

385
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,592
And, it doesn’t matter
So I’m going to tell you like this.

386
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:21,258
I’m pregnant.

387
00:32:21,383 --> 00:32:23,550
We're going to be parents, Koldo.

388
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,967
That's too much.

389
00:32:26,092 --> 00:32:27,342
And it wasn’t a shotgun wedding.

390
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:30,467
For anyone who's listening,
especially from my family.

391
00:32:30,592 --> 00:32:33,175
Just so you know, we didn't get
married because of that

392
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,342
I found out this morning, at home

393
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:41,717
What's happening?

394
00:32:42,842 --> 00:32:44,467
What's happening? Why did it stop?

395
00:32:44,592 --> 00:32:46,300
Why did it stop? Why did it stop?
Where is she?

396
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:49,050
The only place with a megaphone is
Central Control

397
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:49,967
They must be there.

398
00:32:50,092 --> 00:32:52,050
But right now it's impossible
to get to them.

399
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,800
No, there must be away.

400
00:32:55,508 --> 00:32:57,383
There must be away!

401
00:33:04,175 --> 00:33:06,967
Please, help me, God.

402
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:26,675
St. George.

403
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:34,008
St. George.

404
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:38,133
Where is Central Control?

405
00:33:42,092 --> 00:33:45,675
Koldo, where are you...?
Can you see him?

406
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,050
- it’s too soon.
- What is?

407
00:33:48,175 --> 00:33:51,175
Not yet it can’t be happening!

408
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,258
- What?
- Genesis.

409
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:59,550
And the angels who did not keep
their dignity,

410
00:33:59,675 --> 00:34:03,217
but abandoned their own abode...

411
00:34:05,592 --> 00:34:08,508
The Lord kept it in darkness...

412
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:10,967
eternal visions...

413
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,300
where they will be punished

414
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:19,633
and where they will not come back

415
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,508
until Judgement Day.

416
00:34:23,175 --> 00:34:25,175
Koldo, where are you?

417
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,758
He's here. He's here!
He's here, Father.

418
00:34:44,842 --> 00:34:46,425
Come on, Father.

419
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:47,967
This is the end.

420
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:35,592
Come on, Father!

421
00:35:43,383 --> 00:35:45,842
Father! Father!

422
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:47,008
What...?

423
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:52,175
I’m sorry,
we have to get out of here

424
00:36:21,842 --> 00:36:22,967
Let's go.

425
00:36:24,675 --> 00:36:25,758
Come on!

426
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:45,717
What's that?

427
00:37:07,883 --> 00:37:09,133
That's the...

428
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:12,717
...and now I’m going down
to the engine room...

429
00:37:12,842 --> 00:37:14,092
Rafa?

430
00:37:18,175 --> 00:37:19,925
Oh...

431
00:37:20,758 --> 00:37:22,967
Oh, Clara.

432
00:37:24,925 --> 00:37:27,008
What the hell are you doing here?

433
00:37:27,342 --> 00:37:29,717
You don't know what's going on?

434
00:37:32,758 --> 00:37:34,800
No.

435
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:38,925
Well, you'll never believe it...

436
00:37:44,425 --> 00:37:46,133
That way

437
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:38,300
First floor, corridor on the left.
Central Control is down there.

438
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,758
- But do you know where he is?
- No, but we’re going to find him.

439
00:39:04,883 --> 00:39:07,633
- A solution
- What?

440
00:39:07,758 --> 00:39:09,717
They obey orders. I’ve seen it.

441
00:39:09,842 --> 00:39:14,925
They move as one. They do what
a superior, malign being tells them.

442
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,550
Where did you get all that from, Father?

443
00:39:16,675 --> 00:39:20,508
I didn't get anything.
Look at how they behave, and you’ll see.

444
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:23,633
They tell us in the Bible.

445
00:39:23,758 --> 00:39:26,758
And then you wonder why everyone
thinks French girls are sluts.

446
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:28,842
They are bodies that...

447
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,508
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

448
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:51,258
Jesus...

449
00:39:52,925 --> 00:39:55,550
it’s her.
Father Albelda is right.

450
00:39:55,675 --> 00:39:57,508
Quickly! Go!

451
00:39:58,842 --> 00:40:00,842
Get going. Don't stop.

452
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:03,050
Hurry up, go on!
Come on, Clara!

453
00:40:03,175 --> 00:40:06,342
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want...

454
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,967
Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death,

455
00:40:09,092 --> 00:40:12,050
I shall fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

456
00:40:12,175 --> 00:40:13,925
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me

457
00:40:15,092 --> 00:40:18,383
Thy kindness and love will always
be with me each day of my life,

458
00:40:18,508 --> 00:40:20,633
and I will live forever in thy house,

459
00:40:21,383 --> 00:40:24,050
I asked the Lord to free me
three times,

460
00:40:24,175 --> 00:40:26,758
but he answered:
"My grace is sufficient,

461
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,425
because my power will triumph
in weakness".

462
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,050
So, I will boast all the more gladly
of my weaknesses,

463
00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:35,175
so that the power of Christ
may dwell in me.

464
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,008
I am content with insults,
hardships, persecutions,

465
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:40,592
and calamities
for the sake of Christ;

466
00:40:40,717 --> 00:40:45,300
for whenever I am weak,
then I am strong.

467
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:05,967
Clara?

468
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:15,467
Clara?

469
00:43:02,008 --> 00:43:03,842
Jesus, I can't see a thing.

470
00:43:04,842 --> 00:43:06,258
Where are we?

471
00:43:06,633 --> 00:43:08,008
I don’t know

472
00:43:10,092 --> 00:43:11,133
This way

473
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,800
Jesus!

474
00:43:24,133 --> 00:43:25,175
Shit!

475
00:43:25,633 --> 00:43:27,050
Oh Oh Oh Oh!

476
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:49,842
Hello?

477
00:43:50,883 --> 00:43:52,175
Who's that?

478
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:53,592
Don’t move!

479
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:57,133
It’s me, the children's entertainer.
Sponge John

480
00:43:57,467 --> 00:43:58,675
Jesus.

481
00:43:59,675 --> 00:44:00,592
You mean Bob?

482
00:44:00,717 --> 00:44:03,092
Well, there was this thing
with the copyright, and...

483
00:44:04,925 --> 00:44:06,967
Bob, put that down, please.

484
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,092
I took it from the guard.
I don't even know if it's loaded.

485
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,967
Don't hold that lighter too close.
This stuff catches fire easily.

486
00:44:13,633 --> 00:44:16,258
Help me to lift this barrier up.
It’s really heavy.

487
00:44:16,383 --> 00:44:18,258
And this sponge costume doesn’t help

488
00:44:18,633 --> 00:44:19,967
Why don't you take it off?

489
00:44:20,217 --> 00:44:22,217
Well, because I’m not wearing
anything underneath.

490
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:23,592
Is there a light here?

491
00:44:23,883 --> 00:44:26,675
Yes, there's a control panel
on the wall there.

492
00:44:30,383 --> 00:44:33,717
Clara, what is all this?

493
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:36,508
I don’t know I don’t know

494
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,383
We'll get out of here Don’t worry

495
00:44:40,508 --> 00:44:41,842
...two and three!

496
00:44:44,008 --> 00:44:46,425
I almost decided not to come.

497
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:48,092
What?

498
00:44:48,883 --> 00:44:52,050
I was thinking about not coming.

499
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:56,175
The truth is,
I was surprised you invited me.

500
00:44:57,508 --> 00:44:59,842
We haven't seen each other for ages.

501
00:45:00,717 --> 00:45:07,883
Well, I invited you to be nice.
Because I didn’t think you'd come.

502
00:45:11,092 --> 00:45:18,050
I looked on the Internet and I found
this really cheap low-cost ticket.

503
00:45:22,425 --> 00:45:24,008
Fuck!

504
00:45:26,967 --> 00:45:28,342
I’m sorry.

505
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:31,633
Oh, no!

506
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:33,675
Give me the bloody shotgun!

507
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:41,050
I’m really sorry I invited you
to my wedding.

508
00:45:41,508 --> 00:45:42,925
Jesus!

509
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:48,925
Natalié, Natalié.

510
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,925
Clara, please!

511
00:45:57,467 --> 00:45:59,258
Clara! Clara!

512
00:46:29,258 --> 00:46:32,633
This way! Come on!
This way!

513
00:46:32,675 --> 00:46:35,258
- Come on, Clara!
- Wait for me!

514
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:40,508
What’s wrong?

515
00:46:40,592 --> 00:46:42,175
I think I saw something..

516
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,133
Let's go and see.

517
00:46:46,508 --> 00:46:47,633
Come on.

518
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:51,925
Clara, you stay here. We're going
to see if it’s safe, okay?

519
00:47:54,342 --> 00:47:55,675
Mum?

520
00:48:02,383 --> 00:48:03,883
Mum?

521
00:48:08,717 --> 00:48:10,092
Mum?

522
00:48:58,217 --> 00:49:02,092
Clara, leave her. We have to go.

523
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:06,508
Clara, leave her, we have to go.

524
00:49:07,467 --> 00:49:08,842
This is my mother.

525
00:49:08,925 --> 00:49:11,008
Clara, it's not your mother, okay?

526
00:49:11,133 --> 00:49:12,800
Lether go, we have to leave.

527
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:16,300
Come on, Clara, they're coming.
Come on!

528
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:19,258
Come on! Run!

529
00:49:47,633 --> 00:49:48,800
This is it!

530
00:49:50,925 --> 00:49:52,008
Koldo!

531
00:49:55,842 --> 00:49:56,883
Clara!

532
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:01,800
Come on, Clara!
Get in, quick!

533
00:50:35,258 --> 00:50:36,467
Run!

534
00:50:42,217 --> 00:50:43,175
Stop!

535
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,592
The exit is over there!

536
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,217
Jesus, Clara, why are you stopping.
What’s wrong?

537
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:52,842
I’m not going without Koldo.

538
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,133
Don’t be so bloody stupid!
We have to go!

539
00:50:55,258 --> 00:50:57,342
Don’t tell me what I have to do!

540
00:50:58,467 --> 00:50:59,842
Listen, Clara...

541
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:04,175
if Koldo was alive...

542
00:51:05,342 --> 00:51:08,717
he would have given us some sign
to let us know.

543
00:51:20,467 --> 00:51:21,967
I’m sorry.

544
00:51:26,758 --> 00:51:29,300
I’m sorry, Clara...

545
00:52:06,008 --> 00:52:07,342
it’s him.

546
00:52:08,675 --> 00:52:10,050
It’s Koldo.

547
00:52:11,092 --> 00:52:12,508
It’s a sign.

548
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:17,258
He's in the Lounge.

549
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,842
No, we don't know if it's him.

550
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:21,383
You said that if he was alive,
he'd give us a sign, didn’t you?

551
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:23,800
Well, there it is

552
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:28,092
I’m not leaving here without Koldo.

553
00:52:37,008 --> 00:52:37,925
Move.

554
00:52:45,217 --> 00:52:46,383
Hold my dress.

555
00:52:46,508 --> 00:52:48,217
- What are you going to do?
- Hold my dress!

556
00:52:56,467 --> 00:52:57,550
Wow!

557
00:53:01,883 --> 00:53:03,800
Now, you make your own decision.

558
00:53:04,342 --> 00:53:06,592
But I know where I’m going.

559
00:53:35,175 --> 00:53:36,967
They've got in

560
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:55,675
Atún?

561
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,675
Uncle, no, no, no!

562
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,675
Jesus, they're already here.

563
00:56:32,758 --> 00:56:34,717
Clara, come on. Run!
We have to go!

564
00:56:37,092 --> 00:56:38,800
No fucking way.

565
00:56:44,008 --> 00:56:45,425
Clara, come on!

566
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:52,425
This is my day!

567
00:56:52,967 --> 00:56:54,592
This is my day!

568
00:58:09,258 --> 00:58:10,758
Jesus!

569
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:13,883
Fucking hell!

570
00:58:14,383 --> 00:58:15,717
Oh!

571
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:19,050
Oh, God!

572
00:58:22,342 --> 00:58:23,758
Rafa?

573
00:58:28,508 --> 00:58:29,675
Rafa?

574
00:58:34,508 --> 00:58:35,633
No!

575
00:58:42,508 --> 00:58:44,508
Clara, Clara...

576
00:58:47,383 --> 00:58:49,883
Jesus, this is really weird.

577
00:58:50,092 --> 00:58:51,550
This is really weird.

578
00:58:54,383 --> 00:58:56,300
I’m sorry, Rafa.

579
00:58:57,633 --> 00:58:59,050
Clara...

580
01:00:28,633 --> 01:00:29,550
Clara!

581
01:00:30,467 --> 01:00:33,633
Clara! I’m here!
I’m here, my love!

582
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:35,342
I’m up here!

583
01:00:39,592 --> 01:00:42,008
Koldo!
Koldo, my love!

584
01:00:42,258 --> 01:00:45,008
I’m here, my love!
I’m here!

585
01:00:45,592 --> 01:00:47,883
I knew it!

586
01:00:49,258 --> 01:00:51,717
Come up, come up.
There's a ladder here!

587
01:00:57,175 --> 01:00:58,508
My love...

588
01:00:59,133 --> 01:01:01,508
I’m coming, my love...

589
01:01:13,008 --> 01:01:14,842
I’m coming, my love!

590
01:01:16,008 --> 01:01:18,217
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

591
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,050
I love you.

592
01:01:19,383 --> 01:01:20,925
We're never going to separate again,
are we?

593
01:01:20,967 --> 01:01:22,550
- No.
- Never.

594
01:01:23,342 --> 01:01:25,217
And we’re going to be parents.

595
01:01:38,425 --> 01:01:39,967
We have to open this.

596
01:01:40,633 --> 01:01:41,883
The screwdriver.

597
01:01:42,008 --> 01:01:43,217
The screwdriver.

598
01:01:43,342 --> 01:01:46,133
There's a screwdriver
on the Swiss Army knife.

599
01:01:46,217 --> 01:01:47,508
It must be down there somewhere.

600
01:01:48,675 --> 01:01:50,175
You have to find it, baby.

601
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,383
It’s our only chance.
Look for it!

602
01:01:57,633 --> 01:01:59,842
It must be there somewhere.
Look again!

603
01:02:01,842 --> 01:02:03,258
It has to be there.

604
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,550
It has to be there.

605
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,925
I’ve got it!

606
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:09,508
Come on, bring it up!

607
01:02:17,425 --> 01:02:18,508
Here it is!

608
01:02:27,175 --> 01:02:28,717
They're coming, Koldo!

609
01:02:29,925 --> 01:02:31,342
They're coming!

610
01:02:32,925 --> 01:02:34,842
Open it, Koldo!
Open it!

611
01:02:37,383 --> 01:02:39,217
Hurry, Koldo!

612
01:02:39,383 --> 01:02:41,800
Koldo! Koldo!...

613
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,175
Lether go!

614
01:02:45,383 --> 01:02:46,425
Koldo!

615
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:49,883
- My love...
- Hurry, Koldo!

616
01:03:10,008 --> 01:03:11,467
My love...

617
01:03:21,425 --> 01:03:24,300
- Are you all right?
- Yes, and you?

618
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,842
Yes.

619
01:03:31,383 --> 01:03:35,550
- What's all this?
- I don’t know

620
01:03:41,008 --> 01:03:42,425
And now what do we do?

621
01:03:42,675 --> 01:03:44,842
The tunnel!
The tunnel, the tunnel!

622
01:03:44,883 --> 01:03:47,050
We got out through there earlier.

623
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,883
You would have been
a wonderful mother.

624
01:04:18,342 --> 01:04:19,675
I love you.

625
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:21,425
I love you.

626
01:04:25,467 --> 01:04:29,383
In the beginning, God created
the heaven and the earth.

627
01:04:29,425 --> 01:04:31,675
And the earth was
without form and void..

628
01:04:31,758 --> 01:04:34,967
And darkness was on the face
of the deep.

629
01:04:35,133 --> 01:04:37,592
And God divided the light
from the darkness.

630
01:04:37,842 --> 01:04:40,717
And God called the light Day, and...

631
01:04:40,925 --> 01:04:43,342
the darkness he called Night.

632
01:04:43,717 --> 01:04:45,092
They're stopping.

633
01:04:45,175 --> 01:04:48,342
And the evening and the morning
were the first day.

634
01:04:48,508 --> 01:04:51,425
They're stopping. They're stopping.
Why are they stopping?

635
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:53,758
I don’t know

636
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:57,258
But let's go.

637
01:04:57,342 --> 01:05:02,050
Let the waters under the heaven be
gathered together unto one place,

638
01:05:02,092 --> 01:05:04,758
and let the dry land appear:
and it was so.

639
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:08,133
And God called the dry land Earth;

640
01:05:08,717 --> 01:05:12,550
and the gathering together of the
waters called he Seas...

641
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:54,467
ls this our family?

642
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,258
Koldo...

643
01:05:57,383 --> 01:05:59,508
Not any more.

644
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,175
Not any more.

645
01:06:05,633 --> 01:06:07,717
...in the midst of the waters.

646
01:06:07,883 --> 01:06:12,300
And God said, Let there be light:
and there was light.

647
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:18,008
And let them be for lights
in the firmament of the heaven

648
01:06:18,092 --> 01:06:20,425
to give light upon the earth...

649
01:07:22,008 --> 01:07:24,633
No, no!

650
01:07:25,633 --> 01:07:26,550
No!

651
01:07:27,092 --> 01:07:28,342
No!

652
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:30,258
God!

653
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:34,425
Fuck my granddad and his stupid
bloody hearing aid!

654
01:07:54,758 --> 01:07:55,883
The sword.

655
01:07:59,592 --> 01:08:01,050
Pick up the sword.

656
01:08:06,508 --> 01:08:08,342
Pick it up, Koldo...

657
01:08:19,008 --> 01:08:20,383
Come on!

658
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:33,633
Do it!

659
01:08:59,008 --> 01:09:01,550
Well done, my love.

660
01:09:12,008 --> 01:09:14,842
You're going to be
a wonderful father.

661
01:10:17,175 --> 01:10:21,300
Koldo, there are people over there!

662
01:11:28,842 --> 01:11:32,342
Stay inside and do not come out!

663
01:11:34,092 --> 01:11:38,842
Stay inside!
I repeat, do not come out!

664
01:11:38,883 --> 01:11:41,425
Stay inside!

665
01:11:42,133 --> 01:11:43,633
I repeat...

666
01:12:15,758 --> 01:12:18,800
Put her on the ground!
She is infected!

667
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:22,175
I repeat,
put her on the ground!

668
01:12:22,425 --> 01:12:24,092
Get away!

669
01:12:28,217 --> 01:12:30,008
She is infected!

670
01:12:30,383 --> 01:12:35,633
I repeat, move away!
Put her on the ground!
