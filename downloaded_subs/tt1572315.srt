Oh, okay.

834
01:09:17,363 --> 01:09:18,364
Okay, so who is he?

835
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:22,827
Well, the person in the basement

836
01:09:24,245 --> 01:09:25,746
is Jedidiah Sawyer.

837
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:27,540
Goes by Jed.

838
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:29,542
He's your cousin.

839
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,711
For years I suspected something,

840
01:09:32,795 --> 01:09:34,630
but I never knew for sure about Jed

841
01:09:34,713 --> 01:09:37,424
until about four months ago when Verna,

842
01:09:38,884 --> 01:09:41,595
who was very sick, presented him to me.

843
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:45,850
A grown man, huge, but mentally stunted.

844
01:09:47,059 --> 01:09:49,562
With emotions of an eight-year-old.

845
01:09:50,896 --> 01:09:52,731
Frankly, he scared the shit out of me.

846
01:09:53,566 --> 01:09:54,567
Why'd she keep him?

847
01:09:56,235 --> 01:09:58,571
Nobody loves you like your family, I guess.

848
01:09:58,904 --> 01:10:00,281
She preserved you, too.

849
01:10:01,282 --> 01:10:04,243
She investigated everyone
who was involved with the...

850
01:10:04,952 --> 01:10:06,078
August 19th.

851
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:07,621
Found you right away.

852
01:10:07,705 --> 01:10:09,225
And she let me live with those people?

853
01:10:09,623 --> 01:10:11,083
You were safer there.

854
01:10:12,418 --> 01:10:15,296
And she knew
there would always come a day.

855
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:18,257
Jed knows about you, too.

856
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:19,925
That was some welcome.

857
01:10:22,386 --> 01:10:24,138
He doesn't know who you are.

858
01:10:24,597 --> 01:10:26,348
And the last time a girl got away,

859
01:10:26,432 --> 01:10:28,142
Jed lost his whole family.

860
01:10:28,225 --> 01:10:31,103
So, he'll stay after you.
He doesn't know any better.

861
01:10:31,437 --> 01:10:32,730
Burt Hartman, too.

862
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:36,233
