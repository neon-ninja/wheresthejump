1
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,900
-Oh, yeah!
-Hook them horns, baby!

2
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,500
We are on our way
to the biggest party of the world.

3
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,800
Yeah!

4
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,600
Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request Line.
This is Stretch.

5
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,900
<i>That's for Glen.</i>

6
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,100
<i>And could you tell the girls</i>
<i>at Mesquite High just to leave him alone?</i>

7
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,900
<i>Got it, and I believe it.</i>
<i>Glen is off-limits now.</i>

8
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,500
This is Stretch on an open request line
on K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas,

9
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,500
Red River Rock 'n' Roll, from the tip-top
of the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex.

10
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,700
Heck, let's give Stretch a call
and see what she says.

11
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
-What kind of name is Stretch?
-No idea.

12
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,700
Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request Line.
This is Stretch.

13
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,900
Yo, Stretch!
It's the one and only Buzz.

14
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And Rick the Prick!

15
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,800
And from all the senior boys
at Wheeler High to all the senior girls,

16
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,300
who are so stuck-up, boy,
you're on the road to nowhere.

17
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,300
No, you mean,
"We're on the road to nowhere."

18
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,500
No, baby.

19
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,400
We're on the road
to Texas-OU Weekend in Dallas!

20
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,100
You're on the road to nowhere!

21
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,300
Hook them horns, baby!

22
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,400
Real funny, guys.

23
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,200
Okay, you wanna hang up now?

24
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,200
Tying up the line. Hey, come on.

25
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,500
-No way, baby!
-We got a lot more requests!

26
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,200
Hey, check it out, dude.

27
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
Let's play a little chicken
with the farmer here.

28
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,400
-Come on, baby! Come on!
-Come on!

29
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Come on, man.

30
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,500
Come on!

31
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,300
-Hot damn!
-Hook them horns!

32
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,000
That was great! That was great!

33
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,400
You got that, babe? Hot line?

34
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
<i>You better stick with us, baby!</i>

35
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah. Later, sports. Just hang up, okay?

36
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,500
No way!

37
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,700
Hook them horns!

38
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,800
<i>-L.G!</i>
<i>-Damn it, I'm trying, darling.</i>

39
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,000
<i>Don't call me darling, damn it.</i>

40
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,300
It's 8:11, Texas-time, on a Friday night.

41
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,100
I know nobody's listening
because y'all are all zooming,

42
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,000
but I got a shot of hot rock 'n' roll
for you anyway.

43
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,900
K-OKLA, Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request.

44
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,700
What it is, Stretch? This is the Buzz again.

45
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,600
Not again. Hang it up, lame-o.
Go call your mother.

46
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah, yeah, talk dirty.
But this is for Rick the Prick.

47
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,800
He wants to hear
<i>Bright Lights, Big Titties.</i>

48
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,200
Wrong. I don't want to hear it.
I want to see it!

49
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,400
Bright lights, big titties!

50
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,800
L.G? L.G., get in here, please.

51
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,700
What the fuck?

52
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,000
Are you crazy?

53
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,500
Back up, pig fucker!

54
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,600
Come on. Hurry up. Get out of here!

55
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,500
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>They gotta hang up.</i>

56
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
<i>Step on it!</i>

57
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,400
-Shit! What the fuck?
-Come on, hurry up!

58
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,900
<i>Hang up!</i>

59
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,200
-What the hell is that?
-Look, it's some kind of geek.

60
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,200
-The geek's got a...
-Come on. What is that?

61
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,400
-Shit!
-Come on. Get out of here.

62
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,900
-Where'd he come from?
-I don't believe this shit!

63
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,800
Just keep driving. Come on.

64
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,700
-Hey, let's go. Come on.
-What the hell is that?

65
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,900
-Go on! What's he doing?
-God damn it!

66
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,500
What's he got there?

67
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,100
Jesus Christ!

68
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,900
-What?
-Come on. What is that?

69
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,600
-I don't believe this shit!
-Come on!

70
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,100
<i>You can do it! Come on!</i>

71
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,700
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God!

72
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,800
-Holy shit!
-Come on, get out of here!

73
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,200
He's got a fucking chainsaw!

74
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,600
-Sounds like a buzz saw.
-Buzz saw?

75
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
Hey, hang up, man.

76
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,400
Hang up. Hang up, hang up, hang up,
hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up!

77
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,900
Get him. Shoot the bastard. Get him. Shit!

78
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,900
Fuck! Shoot that motherfucker, yeah!

79
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,000
Shit! Keep back! God!

80
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,300
Son of a bitch! Shit!

81
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
Missed us, assholes.

82
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,000
What? It just cut off.

83
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,500
Did you do that? What happened?

84
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,100
It's like super feedback.

85
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Just put the underwoofer
across the overflapper.

86
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't know.

87
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,600
Just went dead air.

88
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,400
-I want the license plate.
-No problem.

89
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,700
All right, now, ease up here.

90
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You go get your pictures.

91
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,000
Watch out, Bob.

92
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
All right, keep
the tension on that line.

93
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,800
Hey, loosen that chain.
We need some slack.

94
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,800
Easy. Easy.

95
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,700
You, get out of there!

96
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,800
<i>Three-zero.</i>

97
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,400
Cowboy, get away from there.
This is an accident scene.

98
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,900
The area is restricted.

99
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,100
-Not gonna tell you...
-It's all right. It's all right, Wendell.

100
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,500
Lieutenant Enright, sir.

101
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,700
We heard you might be headed this way.
Did you come over for the big game?

102
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,300
You know why I'm here.

103
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,100
Yes, sir,
something about the chainsaw killers,

104
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,100
your brother's kids killed.

105
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,600
But that was 14 years ago, sir,
way down in South Texas.

106
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,600
Now, these are other kids.

107
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,400
This is just an accident.

108
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,900
Just a couple of wild punks
out raising hell.

109
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,700
Yep.

110
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
One of those boys is so wild
sawed his own head off

111
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,200
going 90 mile per hour.

112
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,300
Hell.

113
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,200
Hell's exactly what they raised.

114
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,500
No, sir, that information's off the record.

115
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,400
You know, sir, this is always
a pretty hairy weekend for Dallas.

116
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,100
Whole lot of folks come to town
and don't give a damn about football.

117
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,900
You know, they just wanna go blood crazy
for a few and riot.

118
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,400
You know what "riot" means.
You were a Ranger.

119
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,800
I can't hardly keep them down by law,
and if...

120
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,600
If you go around
promoting this chainsaw...

121
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,500
Try to speak plain.

122
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,200
Saves time.

123
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,800
I have authority

124
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,600
from the DA's office to put you
right back on the next plane to Amarillo.

125
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,300
Well, you just do that, son.
I'd like to see that authority.

126
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,600
All right, Lieutenant Enright,
what's your deal?

127
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,000
All right.

128
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm gonna ask some questions.

129
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,100
Put it in the press. Get it in the news.

130
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,900
Any information about this accident

131
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,300
and maybe some witnesses.

132
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,900
Yes, sir,
I know some old boys at the paper.

133
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,100
We'll get your story out for you.

134
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,800
Brazos.

135
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,700
Brazos.

136
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,400
Brazos!

137
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,400
Remember the Alamo, cowboy.

138
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,000
I won!

139
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,500
Come on!

140
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,300
Asshole.

141
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,200
You need a witness? I'm a witness.

142
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,200
This Mercedes? I think I was talking
to those kids when it happened.

143
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,700
No way was that an accident.

144
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,600
-You saw it.
-No, but I heard it.

145
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,500
You can listen. It's here on tape.

146
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,700
Regulations.
We gotta record all the call-ins.

147
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,200
End of the night, we wipe the tapes,

148
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,100
but I kept this one just 'cause...
It just got to me.

149
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
We got professionals working on this...

150
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,700
I didn't know what I'd heard,
but I read your story.

151
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,100
-What you're looking for is on this tape.
-...so don't fool with it.

152
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,800
You can slow it down now.

153
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,900
You're just a joke in this morning's paper.

154
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,700
"Cowboy chases chainsaws 14 years.

155
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,300
"Dallas police refuse comment."

156
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,600
Like you're, you know,
hung up on something crazy.

157
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,400
But I believe you.
I might be the only believer you got.

158
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,900
-'Cause it's right here.
-What is?

159
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,500
Right on here, those kids getting killed.

160
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,000
Now, this is evidence, sort of, right?

161
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,500
Yeah, it's time for you to go home.

162
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,800
-No, wait a minute, wait a minute.
-Come on.

163
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,900
Look, I came here
because I thought I could help you.

164
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I deejay this dumb show
on K-OKLA up in Burkburnett,

165
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
but people listen to me
all across North Texas.

166
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,400
Now, I could put you on the radio,

167
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,800
get people to believe you,
get you some help.

168
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,900
You're gonna get in my way.

169
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,100
-Don't you get in my way.
-No, I'm already right in the middle of this.

170
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,400
This is my chance
to stop playing head-banging music

171
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,800
and do something real.

172
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,400
Well, I don't need anybody
to stand with me,

173
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,700
all right?

174
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,000
You can't do it alone.

175
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,100
I got a perfect willingness to die.

176
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,000
That gives me a moral
on this bunch of mad dogs.

177
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,100
They live on fear. They thrive on it.

178
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,500
I ain't got no fear left.

179
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,800
I ain't got no fear, Lord.

180
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,600
-Hardass.
-Hardass? Me?

181
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,100
Well, maybe a semi-hardass,
but I got a soft heart.

182
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,800
Looky.

183
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,600
-Built you a little fry house.
-L.G!

184
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,200
What, darling?

185
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh, L.G.

186
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,200
<i>Okay, everybody, hush up. Listen up, y'all.</i>

187
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
<i>The Texas-OU Chili Cook-off champion is</i>

188
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,500
<i>from Norman, Oklahoma? No.</i>

189
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
<i>Waco, Texas?</i>

190
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,900
<i>Tulsa? Nope.</i>

191
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,600
-Pardon me.
<i>-Austin?</i>

192
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,100
<i>He's Dallas' favorite caterer.</i>
<i>I think he's kind of cute.</i>

193
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,600
<i>The Last Round-up Rolling Grill chef,</i>

194
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,000
<i>Drayton Sawyer!</i>

195
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,600
Drayton!

196
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,800
Drayton! Drayton! Drayton! Drayton!

197
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
Way to go, Drayton!

198
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,900
It's the second year in a row.
This year, Drayton,

199
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
you've got to tell the secret
of that fabulously tasty chili!

200
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,700
<i>No secret. It's the meat.</i>

201
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,500
<i>Don't skimp on the meat.</i>

202
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,000
<i>I got a real good eye for prime meat.</i>

203
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,800
<i>Runs in the family.</i>

204
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,700
Oops! Oops!

205
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,500
<i>It's one of those hard-shell peppercorns.</i>

206
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,400
<i>I gotta say, I love this town.</i>

207
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,700
<i>This town loves prime meat!</i>

208
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,000
<i>So there's the big story.</i>
<i>Texas clobbers Oklahoma in chili.</i>

209
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,200
<i>This is Stretch, your fearless reporter,</i>
<i>live from Dallas.</i>

210
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,900
<i>Now, be sure to watch</i>
<i>your drinking and driving</i>

211
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,900

<i>Texas-OU Weekend.</i>

212
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,900
<i>This is Stretch, on K-OKLA...</i>

213
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,000
Cut-Rite.

214
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,700
No, C.L., I ain't seen Fletcher.

215
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,600
Well, last Friday.

216
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,200
Well, hell, he's on the road, then.

217
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,800
Well, don't believe me, then. Fine.

218
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,800
C.L.

219
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,800
No.

220
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,800
I'll be with you in just a minute, sir.

221
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,300
Now, you're getting
as mean as a sting bat, C.L...

222
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,000
No, hell, don't call back.

223
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,000
No, don't you call back.
I got a business here,

224
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,100
and Fletcher ain't none of my business.

225
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,200
Damn!

226
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,200
What can I do you for?

227
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,200
Well, don't you wanna test them?
There's gas in them.

228
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,200
Get them suckers a time or two.

229
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,200
Oh, my kid banana.

230
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,800
Damn, what is he doing?

231
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,100
Now, this is very hard to believe.

232
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,300
I'd like you to play that tape, missy.

233
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,100
Come all the way up here to Burkburnett.
No shit!

234
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,400
Yeah.

235
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,100
Oh, you wanna hear it now.

236
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,700
I wanna hear it on the radio.

237
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,500
On your show.

238
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,100
Uh-uh.

239
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,900
I don't think it'd be legal to do that.

240
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,900
FCC regulations, those things.

241
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,600
Well, you just figure out how to do it
and do it.

242
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,300
You bend the rules. I don't know.

243
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,000
-Why?
-Because the killers are here.

244
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,700
Kill sites have been clustered all over
Northeast Texas the last two years.

245
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,800
The laws, they shy away
from piecing it together as murder.

246
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,100
They call it accidents, disappearances.

247
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,700
You got that last slaughter on tape.
You play it on the radio.

248
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,100
Maybe then, the laws will stop trying
to shut me up and start helping me.

249
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,900
Besides, it'll give you
something real to do.

250
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,200
You said you were gonna do this alone.

251
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
I need your help, missy.

252
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,300
Well,

253
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,900
you can call me Stretch, Mr. Enright.

254
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Well, now, you can call me Lefty.

255
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,000
It's mighty nice doing business with you.

256
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,100
-Thanks.
-All right.

257
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,400
You have a nice day, now.

258
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,200
You, too.

259
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,500
Number one again!

260
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,400
Drayton did it again. Number one.

261
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,900
Number one!
The Sawyers are number one!

262
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,600
Number one.

263
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,200
So here's a special request
we're doing this afternoon and tonight.

264
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,200
You steady listeners know
we're playing this every hour.

265
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,600
This is for Lefty.

266
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,000
<i>Hog fucker! Son of a bitch!</i>

267
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,400
Last Round-up Rolling Grill.
We're still number one.

268
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,900
I told you, boys, and I told you.

269
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,000
Don't call on this phone.
Now, damn it, get off.

270
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,200
What? What's on the radio?

271
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,000
Now, don't bullshit me. I can't...

272
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,300
I won't... All right, what station?

273
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,300
This ain't no joke, boy?

274
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Then I'm tuning it in.

275
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,800
<i>Hog fucker! Son of a bitch!</i>

276
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,400
You two nap-haired idiots.

277
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,300
You've done it again!

278
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,000
You coon shits! You fudge-packers!

279
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,000
You'll be the death of me yet!

280
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,400
<i>Missed us, assholes.</i>

281
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,000
K-OKLA.

282
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,500
Come on, Lefty. Where are you?

283
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,800
This concludes the broadcast day
for K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas,

284
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,500
Red River Rock 'n' Roll.

285
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,100
In New York, it's 1:00 a.m.,
still fun city.

286
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,900
In LA, 10:00 at night, party time.

287
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,500
But deep in the heart of Texas,
it's 12:00 midnight.

288
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,800
Ain't nothing going on.

289
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,600
<i>It's another cussing caller.</i>

290
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,700
<i>Your little ass is gonna be</i>
<i>in big trouble over that tape, girl.</i>

291
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,200
Nope.

292
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,100
Sure got a lot of complaints, darling.

293
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,500
L.G., it was a request, right?
It's listed in the logs as a request.

294
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,800
People complain
about the request every night, right?

295
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,700
Uh-huh.

296
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,900
Wanna go for coffee at Big State?

297
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,000
Nope.

298
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I guess you're waiting on this guy, Lefty?

299
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,400
L.G.

300
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,900
Night, L.G.

301
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,800
Good night.

302
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,800
God damn it!

303
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,800
Shit!

304
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,500
K-OKLA, this is Stretch.

305
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,500
Hello?

306
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,100
Hello?

307
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,100
Hello?

308
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,200
Hello, Lefty?

309
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,100
L.G?

310
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,100
Lefty?

311
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,100
Lefty?

312
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,600
I wanna buy some radio-ad time.

313
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Are you fucking crazy? We are closed!

314
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,500
Off the air till tomorrow.
You'll have to just come back.

315
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,700
No, but... But, yeah, but...

316
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,100
Whoa...

317
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,800
So this is radio land, huh?
The infinite turnover?

318
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,500
The waves through
the ether fuzz roll on forever.

319
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,200
Can't close that.
Hi, I know what you're thinking.

320
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,600
"This is weird. Hope I can handle it."

321
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,400
You know,

322
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,900
you're my fave.

323
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,000
Me and Bubba, my little brother,
we listen to you every night.

324
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,000
Music is my life.

325
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,300
You know, you're my fave,

326
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,100
but I get too embarrassed
to phone in my request.

327
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
It's too disembodied, you know?

328
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,600
But

329
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,000
Now that we're here in flesh and blood,

330
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,100
I could maybe make a request,
and it'd still count, huh?

331
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,200
Sure.

332
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,200
Well, what about

333
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,900
Iron Butterfly?

334
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,800
You know, like <i>In-A-Vida-Da-Gadda, Baby?</i>

335
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,600
Oh, it's heavy! You know,

336
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,800
I've never been to a radio station before.

337
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,300
Do you think you could do me a tour, huh?

338
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,900
Tour?

339
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,800
Tour. Sure, sure.

340
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,600
But seriously quick,
and it ends at the exit sign.

341
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,200
Oh, boy! Okay, yeah, sure!

342
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,900
Okay, your tour. Here's your tour.
Here's your tour. Here's a lamp.

343
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,900
Yeah, lamp.

344
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,600
Here's a typewriter.

345
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,200
-Rubber man.
-Rubber man. I like him.

346
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,700
Armadillo. Here's Mr. Shark.

347
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,000
Oh, Mr. Shark!

348
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,700
-Here's some flowers.
-Flowers.

349
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,800
-Rolodex.
-Rolodex.

350
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,500
Here's a lamp.

351
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,800
And there's the exit sign. Tour's over.

352
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:50,100
"E-X-I-T.

353
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,300
"Exit."

354
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,700
-Good night.
-Oh! Good night!

355
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,500
Good night!

356
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,400
Good night.

357
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,800
Good night!

358
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,800
Good night.

359
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,200
Hey, what about my request?

360
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,400
You know,

361
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,400
that Lefty-request record

362
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,500
that you honked out today?

363
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,100
I love that!

364
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,000
Let's see.

365
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,300
What was it, anyway?
The <i>Rambo III</i> soundtrack?

366
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,900
Gonna play it again?

367
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,600
Sure would like it.

368
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,100
Hey, maybe I could get a copy,

369
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,900
and you could autograph it.

370
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,000
To a far-out fan!

371
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,300
-What's in here?
-Record vault.

372
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,700
Oh, where you keep the golden oldies?

373
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,600
And maybe...

374
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,800
Maybe the new music's in...

375
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,700
Not me, you dumbass!

376
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,600
Get the girl! Get the girl!

377
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,900
Ow, ow, ow!

378
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,700
He dented my plate! My brain is burning!

379
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,500
Nam flashback! Nam flashback!

380
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,900
Leatherface, you bitch, I'll...

381
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,300
Look what you did
to my Sonny Bono wig-do.

382
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,100
Oh, God damn, I can't believe it!

383
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,300
You gonna have to buy me
a new plate cover!

384
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,800
You gonna have to buy me
a new plate cover, Leatherface.

385
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,100
He's gonna send me back
to the VA Hospital

386
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,800
with this dent in my plate.

387
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,200
Well, at least he didn't mess me up.

388
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,200
Dog will hunt.
Get that bitch, Leatherface.

389
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,900
Get that bitch!

390
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,000
Dog will hunt.

391
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,000
Go away!

392
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,500
Shit. Humble Pie!

393
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,800
Hurry up, Leatherface. Hurry up.
Get that bitch!

394
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,600
Go away!

395
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,700
Music is my life!

396
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,800
They live on fear. They live on fear.
They live on fear.

397
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,400
They live on fear. They live on fear.
They live on fear.

398
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,900
Stretch, darling,
you know the door's unlocked?

399
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,100
Hey!

400
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,400
What the shit?

401
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,700
Hey! Lick my plate, you dog dick!

402
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,500
What the fuck you think
you're doing in here,

403
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,800
you crazy-looking little son of a bitch?

404
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,100
Get out of here!

405
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,000
Time for incoming mail!

406
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,200
Ho Chi Minh!

407
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,200
A-one and a-two and a-three!

408
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,600
Go, you little bitch!

409
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,500
Go away! Leave me alone!

410
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,400
No, no, no, no! God, no, please don't!

411
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
Incoming mail!

412
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,300
No, no, no!

413
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,100
No, no, no, please, God, no!

414
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,500
No, no, no, please, God! Please, God, no!

415
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,900
No!

416
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,300
No, no, no, please, God! Stop it! God, no!

417
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,200
No, no, please, God!

418
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,300
Are you mad at me?

419
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,100
How mad at me are you?

420
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,500
You're not really mad at me.

421
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,800
How good are you?

422
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,700
Huh?

423
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,100
Get that bitch, Leatherface!
Get that bitch!

424
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,200
How good

425
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,700
are you?

426
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Oh...

427
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,100
Really?

428
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,200
Are you really, really

429
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,700
good?

430
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,300
Are you really good?

431
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,200
You're really good.

432
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,400
You're the best.

433
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,000
Oh, no.

434
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,700
No! No!

435
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,400
Please don't kill me!

436
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,800
No, God!

437
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,400
No, God!

438
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,200
No, please, God!

439
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,600
No, God!

440
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,100
Oh, God! Oh, God!

441
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,000
Leatherface.

442
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,600
Did you get her, Bubba?
Did you get that bitch?

443
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,200
She was my fave, but she knew.

444
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,600
And now, nobody knows.

445
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,900
Look what you did to my plate, you bitch!

446
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,900
You got her? Did you get her good?

447
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,600
Slap me five.

448
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,500
I got one, too.

449
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,200
A bonus body!

450
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,200
Look at that beef.

451
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,100
Help me get it out of here.

452
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,400
Whoa...

453
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:02,800
Giddyup!

454
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,900
No, they'll get away.

455
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,200
No, no, they'll get away.

456
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,800
They can't get away.

457
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
God damn it, Lefty. You're late.

458
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,500
Damn it, Lefty.

459
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,900
No!

460
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,500
Stretch!

461
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,400
Lefty?

462
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,600
Stretch!

463
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,500
Hold on!

464
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,200
Grab onto something. Hold onto it.

465
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,400
Lefty, they came! Where were you?

466
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,800
I had to do it. Damn, I used you, girl.

467
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I'm here now. Grab hold of this.

468
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,100
Grab hold of this, now.
Don't you cry, little sister. I'm here now.

469
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,100
Come on, I'm here now. You can get it.
Come on, now.

470
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,300
You got it. Come on.

471
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,700
Come on! Grab it!

472
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,400
Oh, my God.

473
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:43,400
Oh, Lord, help me beat this stranger
that walks beside me,

474
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,700
that takes away my strength.

475
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,700
Lord, you show me the end.

476
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,600
Show me what I fear
so I don't fear it no more.

477
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,300
It's the devil's playground.

478
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,000
I'm bringing it down! Down to hell!

479
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,900
Bring it all down!

480
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,100
Bring it all down!

481
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:38,600
I hate to say it, but that hillbilly hog
you boys got earlier is the tops tonight.

482
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,300
That's mine! Mine!
Not Bubba's. Me! Me!

483
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,900
Bust it up!

484
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,400
Wanna go to the movies?

485
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,100
No crowds.
Everybody's at the football parties.

486
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,800
Tonight's a washout.

487
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:53,000
Biggest meat-eater weekend of the month,
and we're gonna lose money on it.

488
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,300
Damn it all! Maybe we just ought to quit.

489
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,900
Oh, yeah? Kiss my plate,
Mr. Big Shot. Maybe you forgot.

490
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,400
This chromedome
bankrolled this food business.

491
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,200
No lucky goof with a machete,
no head wound.

492
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,500
No head wound,
no fancy rolling grill a-go-go.

493
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,100
Ain't no fool. Kiss it. Don't forget it.

494
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,000
Peel that pig
and slice him thick.

495
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,200
-That's my sweet pea.
-Get them hogs on the grill.

496
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,600
Big, big pre-game brunch tomorrow
means a ton of croissant sandwiches.

497
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,800
Oh, I love this town.

498
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,200
Hey, you nitwit,
get back in here and get that grill going.

499
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,000
No. No. No good.

500
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,600
No good.

501
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,500
No good.

502
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:24,800
Come on, Bubba. Cook's out here,
and he's chewing ass like it was steak.

503
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,100
"You gotta run for that money now.

504
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,600
"Chase that dollar.
Gotta go fast to catch it."

505
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,900
You dumb baboozer.
Too dumb to even close the door.

506
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I'm tired of kicking your asses.

507
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,900
What are you doing?
You trying to hide something?

508
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,500
Get that eyeball pâté working.

509
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,900
Hey, you coon shit, where are you going?

510
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,900
We need the club sandwiches...

511
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,200
Help. Help me. Please.

512
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,000
Please, help me.

513
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,800
Can you help me get out of here?

514
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,000
Can you help me get out of here?

515
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,800
What is it? Put that down. Put that down.

516
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,500
Put that down.

517
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,500
What is that?

518
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,900
Is it wet? It's wet. Put it down.

519
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,300
My darling.

520
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,500
Darling?

521
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,500
Darling?

522
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,600
Don't be scared, darling.

523
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,100
Oh, no, L.G.

524
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,200
Oh, no. Oh, no.

525
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,700
L.G!

526
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,100
Oh, my God!

527
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,500
L.G., they got you, too?

528
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,500
Oh, L.G!

529
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,500
We gotta get y'all loose.

530
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,700
I guess I'm falling apart on you, honey.

531
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,100
No.

532
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,200
No.

533
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,200
Shit.

534
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,700
L.G.,

535
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,300
I love you.

536
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,700
So he says,

537
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,000
"Hey, get me those lawyers. Legal meat."

538
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,000
Legal meat, yeah!

539
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,900
Legal meat, yeah!

540
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,400
Bubba, you idiot!
Get your ass over here.

541
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,600
-You fucked up again.
-You fucked up again.

542
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,400
He says,
"Hey, get me those lawyers.

543
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,200
"Legal meat, y'all."

544
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,900
Fuck me in the left eye!

545
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:37,100
Valuable kill-time wasted running down
them cooped-up pencil necks,

546
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,800
and not a good chop on the whole bunch.

547
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,800
I pick the vittles. Get it?

548
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,900
-I. Me. Nobody but...
-I pick the vittles, I.

549
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,600
-Bubba, you hull wreckage!
-Me. Nobody but...

550
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:52,000
Busted again, huh?
That's the main support beam.

551
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:58,400
Fuck, you idiots! You both will pay!

552
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,500
Both of you... You're both...

553
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,900
Look what your brother's done now.
You coon shit.

554
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,300
You cut the main support beam.
And this is what happens.

555
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,600
Of course this is what happens.

556
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,900
That big brute!

557
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,900
Dirty meat don't cut it.

558
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,400
Family standards only require
the best meat in town.

559
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,400
More money lost.

560
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,500
I never, never, never get a break.

561
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,100
Work, work night and day,

562
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,500
presenting myself to the people,
selling, selling.

563
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:35,100
You pair of prima donnas fooling around
here and listening to the radio all day

564
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,400
and sawing down your own house.

565
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,800
Take it all down!

566
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,200
Bring it all down!

567
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,500
Bury the devil!

568
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:59,400
May the Lord have mercy on our souls!

569
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,700
Get that thing out of here.

570
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,100
Maybe it cracked the main butane tank.

571
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,500
It's up there. Go look at it.

572
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,400
Taxes. Taxes.

573
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:19,100
Damn property taxes fuck up everything.

574
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:23,200
Crooks don't pay taxes. Politicians don't.

575
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,300
Movie stars don't.

576
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:30,400
It's the little guy that can't make a dime.
He pays the taxes.

577
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,600
Small businessman gets it in the ass
every time.

578
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,200
I ought to quit.

579
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,400
Right, it's junk. Quit.
Dump this cook show.

580
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:43,900
Sell off this turkey.
It's time. It's in the air.

581
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,700
It's what the public wants.

582
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,700
I don't wanna hear that again.

583
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,000
It's Nam Land!

584
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,600
What the hell was that?

585
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,900
I don't know, boy.
It looked like a big, big fireball.

586
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,700
Nam Land.

587
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:14,600
Napalm.

588
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,600
Fire in the hole.

589
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:26,200
That's the main butane tank
up there, Bubba.

590
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,000
Go look at it. Get your butt moving, boy.

591
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:33,500
Go up there and look at it.
Go look at it.

592
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,100
-I'll kick you in the ass again.
-Not now. It's Nam Land.

593
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,700
-It's a hit. It's a bang. It's a smash.
-Shut him up, Bubba.

594
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,600
Did you see it?

595
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,700
Well, did you? Didn't you?

596
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,700
Did you? Didn't you?

597
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,500
Go check it out, boy.

598
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:05,900
-Nam Land!
-Oh, shut up!

599
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,900
I told you to go check it out, boy,
before I start kicking your ass.

600
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,600
Some kind of crazy booger
just skipped through here.

601
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:15,900
No, a booger? How big?

602
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:20,500
A big crazy booger.
Let's haul butt, bro.

603
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,500
Oh, my God.

604
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,700
Oh, God.

605
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,500
Franklin.

606
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,500
Don't you cry, my brother.

607
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,500
I'm here now.

608
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,100
I'm here now.

609
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,100
They can't do this.

610
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,400
They can't do this!

611
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:46,500
They can't do this! They can't do this!

612
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,700
I'll take you back to hell!

613
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,200
I'll take you to hell!

614
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,300
All right, all right!

615
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:26,500
Let's talk about it.

616
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,300
Okay. What, are you pissed-off?
What about me?

617
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,500
Listen, this is not gonna work out.

618
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:40,500
I'm trying to be open with you.
It's nobody's fault. I just can't do this.

619
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,800
Let me go.

620
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,700
Let me go.

621
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:53,700
What the hell's going on here?

622
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,800
Bubba, you nap-haired idiot.

623
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,500
Get out of here.

624
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,400
Who's this? I get it.

625
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,400
Are you the saboteur
that's fucking up our house?

626
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,400
Trying to put me out of business?

627
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,700
Thousands of dollars lost.

628
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,700
You got that kind of money? No!

629
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,100
It's the deejay. My fave.

630
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,100
That dirty thing?

631
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,600
Told me you boys got her.

632
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,500
Well, yeah.

633
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,300
Leatherface killed her
once already tonight.

634
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,500
But look, she's red-faced.

635
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,600
Bubba's been playing with her.
Bubba likes her.

636
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,800
Bubba's got a girlfriend.

637
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,600
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!

638
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,800
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!

639
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,800
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!

640
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,600
Bubba's got a girl...

641
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,500
Is that what this is, Bubba?

642
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,000
The old cock-and-cunt swindle, huh?

643
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:03,100
S-C-E-X. Sex.

644
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,700
And you had to find out about it,
didn't you?

645
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,900
You just couldn't leave it alone.

646
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,200
If you wanted to know about it so bad,
why didn't you ask me?

647
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,100
You wanna know about it?
You wanna know about it?

648
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,600
Ask me. Ask me.

649
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:20,900
It's a swindle, that's all.
So don't get mixed up in it.

650
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,100
Help me. Help me.

651
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,800
Help me.

652
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,500
Please, help me. Please.

653
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,500
Help me.

654
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,100
Please, help me.

655
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,800
All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.

656
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,300
Leave him alone, damn it!

657
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:45,100
Bubba, you were supposed to finish her.
Finish her now.

658
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,600
-Burn her like a rat.
-Finish her.

659
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:52,200
-Burn her like a rat!
-Finish her now.

660
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,100
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!

661
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,200
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!

662
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:58,900
-Burn her like a rat!
-Finish her now!

663
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,600
-Finish her now, Bubba!
-Burn her like a rat!

664
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,900
-Finish her!
-Finish her. Finish her.

665
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,900
Give me that.

666
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:11,100
Turn traitor for a piece of tail.

667
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:15,600
You got one choice, boy, sex or the saw.

668
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,700
Sex is, well, nobody knows.

669
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,500
But the saw, the saw is family.

670
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,700
-The saw is family.
-Wait till Granddad hears about this.

671
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,300
Take her away.

672
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,700
-She's in the garbage now.
-Oh, no.

673
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,200
-Oh, no.
-A-one

674
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,200
and a-two

675
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,700
and three!

676
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,200
No!

677
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,400
Dinnertime, damn it! Let's go.

678
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,000
Eat and run. Eat and run.

679
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:15,400
There's a lot of hungry football fans
to feed.

680
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:19,000
Hurry it up. Grandpa likes to go fast.

681
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:22,500
He always did. Come on. Come on.

682
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,300
Time eats money.

683
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:29,800
Those damn coon shits
are the weight of the family.

684
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:34,300
I stoop my shoulders
taking care of my younger brothers.

685
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:38,500
It squashed the young years out of my life

686
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,700
like a can of cheese whip.

687
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:49,700
I wouldn't wish this rotten life off
on a one-eyed ferret with mange.

688
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:55,100
You're the first girl
Bubba's brought home to dinner.

689
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,200
This is a real special occasion.

690
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,700
Grandpa sure looks forward
to meeting you.

691
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:05,200
He's 137 years old
but still as fast as Jesse James,

692
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:07,400
so don't you worry none.

693
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,300
Here comes Grandpa now.

694
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,800
God bless you, Grandpa.

695
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:15,500
Oh, it's playtime!
It's dinnertime!

696
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,200
Your little boys
have some left here for you.

697
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,800
Yes, no, yes, no!
Yes, we do!

698
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:23,800
We love you!
We love you!

699
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,300
Okay, now. Take it easy, now.
Take it easy with Grandpa.

700
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,900
-That's right. That's right.
-Get him over here easy, now.

701
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,400
-That's right. Okay.
-Come on, you boys.

702
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,000
Easy with Grandpa, now.

703
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,100
-Oh, easy with Grandpa.
-No! No!

704
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:39,600
Oh, please, no.

705
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,900
Don't rattle him like that, damn it!

706
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,900
You're balling up his shit.

707
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,500
No!

708
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,700
Grandpa's strict liquid diet
keeps him as fresh as a rose.

709
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,200
Every spring,

710
01:19:56,300 --> 01:20:01,100
the Atlas Rendering Company
used to throw a big barbecue for Grandpa.

711
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,800
Oh, he was the master.

712
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,900
He was the one and only.

713
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,800
He showed us all the business.

714
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:10,800
We was raised in meat.

715
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:16,500
But then after the glory,
here comes the shame.

716
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:19,100
Atlas went for automation.

717
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,900
The electrified cages,

718
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,700
the cold-steel chutes,

719
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,200
the air-powered head hammers.

720
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:30,100
That drove Grandpa crazy,
seeing things done like that.

721
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,400
Let me go! Let me go!

722
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:36,200
No, no, that's all right. That's all right.
It'll be over soon.

723
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,100
Get the hammer.

724
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:42,500
Get the hammer.

725
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:46,300
The crunching and the grinding,

726
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,800
he just couldn't stand it, no way.

727
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,300
So that was all she wrote.

728
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:55,000
One morning, Grandpa just quit going in.

729
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,800
It was the shame.

730
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:00,600
It was the shame. The shame.

731
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,900
There's more work to do.
Let's get on with it.

732
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,300
Right. Let's get on with it. Bingo!

733
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:11,100
Give me that.
Get that tub over there in a hurry.

734
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,200
Do I have to do every damn thing
around here?

735
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,500
You just sit tight.

736
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,200
Bubba, she's ready. Bring her on down.

737
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,500
No!

738
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:30,000
-Oh, no!
-Bring her on down, damn it!

739
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,600
No! No!

740
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,500
Bring her on down!

741
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,100
No! No, no, no!

742
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,500
No, no, no!

743
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,500
Help me! No, no, no!

744
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:50,400
Let me go! You gotta let me go!
Let me go! Please, help me!

745
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,900
-This will be one you won't forget.
-Please, help me!

746
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,800
It's a real honor.

747
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,700
Grandpa, he's a one-hitter.

748
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:01,500
And it's just like going home.

749
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,500
Please help me!

750
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,600
-No! No! No, God!
-No, no.

751
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,300
Help me! Let me go!

752
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,800
Let me go! Let me go!

753
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,300
Help me, please!

754
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,900
Please, help me!

755
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,100
Let's go see Grandpa, boy.

756
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,700
No, don't!

757
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:32,500
-No! No, God!
-Come on. Bring the bitch down.

758
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,400
No! No! No!

759
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,500
No, no, let me go!

760
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,500
Let me go!

761
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,300
Let me go! No! No!

762
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,400
No, no, no!

763
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,400
No!

764
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,300
Here come the judge.
Here come the judge.

765
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,300
No!

766
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,400
Now, don't ruin Grandpa's favorite rug.

767
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,700
Be careful of the splatter.
You gotta be careful of the splatter.

768
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:04,000
Oh, Great-grandma in chainsaw heaven...

769
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:05,500
No! No! God!

770
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,000
...please don't hoodoo the boy.

771
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,600
Hey, Grandpa, here's the big boy.

772
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:13,200
Look what Bubba brought you.

773
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,200
Hey, Grandpa,
Bubba's got something to show you here.

774
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,200
Look, a Slurpee booty.

775
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,200
-Hit her, Grandpa.
-Come on, Grandpa.

776
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,900
Let's see you do it. Now, come on.
Come on, Grandpa. You're the best.

777
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,200
-Hit her, Grandpa. Hit her!
-Come on. Hit her, Grandpa.

778
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,000
Come on, I'm telling you...

779
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,900
Remember those thieves?
Come on. One-hitter.

780
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,600
-Come on, Grandpa.
-Hit her. Hit her, Grandpa.

781
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,600
Come on, you won't miss her.

782
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,800
-Come on, Grandpa.
-Come on, Grandpa.

783
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:48,200
Hit her. Hit that bitch. Hit that bitch.

784
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:49,500
Come on, Grandpa.

785
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,300
Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
You're the best.

786
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,300
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, there, Grandpa.

787
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,300
Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
You're the best.

788
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,000
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa.

789
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,900
You're the best, Grandpa.

790
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,500
Hit that bitch, Grandpa. Hit her.

791
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:11,200
Come on, Grandpa. Hit her.
You are, Grandpa. You're the best.

792
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,800
Come on, Grandpa. Hit her.
You are, Grandpa. You're the best.

793
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:19,200
Yeah!
That's good, isn't it, Grandpa?

794
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,000
Grandpa!

795
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,800
-Attaboy, Grandpa.
-Hit that bitch, now, Grandpa.

796
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:31,200
-Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
-Get her now, Grandpa. You can do it.

797
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:32,700
Come on, Grandpa.

798
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,300
No! No! No!

799
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:41,100
No! No! No! No!

800
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:44,200
No! No!

801
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:48,000
Hit that bitch. Hit that bitch!

802
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,600
Come on, Grandpa!

803
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,900
Come on, Grandpa!

804
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:00,000
Oh, Grandpa, let's get on with it.

805
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,800
All right! Slurpee-booty time!

806
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,000
Oh, shut up!

807
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,600
What the hell's going on here?

808
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,900
Boys, boys, boys.

809
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,900
What the hell's going on here?

810
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:17,100
Is that the American way of entering
a man's home, singing like that?

811
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:21,400
Oh, I get it. The old pressure game, huh?

812
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:27,400
Boys, you never
should have been doing this.

813
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:31,600
Who sent you?
Those sissies over at Del-Mar Catering?

814
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:34,800
That chickenshit burrito-man bunch?

815
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:40,200
Well, I don't care, you hear?
Yeah, that's right.

816
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,700
It's a dog-eat-dog world.

817
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,900
And from where I sit,
there just ain't enough damn dogs.

818
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,400
If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the damn kitchen.

819
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,700
How much, huh?
Let's make a deal right here.

820
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:58,100
Real cash money.

821
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,800
Just you and me, huh?
I don't care who sent you.

822
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:04,700
I'm the Lord of the Harvest.

823
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:08,300
Who's that? Some new health-food bunch?

824
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,400
Come on. Come on.

825
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:14,200
Is there any money in it, you wanna know?

826
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,900
Yeah, right here. How much, huh?
How much?

827
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:25,100
-Lefty.
-Sister.

828
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,900
Lefty!

829
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,700
Brazos!

830
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,600
Run, sister. Run!

831
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,000
Small businessman

832
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:26,000
that always, always, always
gets it in the ass!

833
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,100
Sure... Sure took care of my hems.

834
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,500
Saved a trip to the hospital.

835
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,500
Looks... Looks bad.

836
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:46,400
Sure burned my beads bad on that one.

837
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:25,800
Maybe it's time to just shut down.

838
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,500
Time to shut down the show, yeah.

839
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,200
Yeah, pull the plug. Come here, nubbins.

840
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,800
Where...
Where's that old "Fuck you, Charlie"?

841
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,600
That little "Just in case, baby"?

842
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,500
Where'd you put it?

843
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:21,700
Yeah, there it is.

844
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:27,000
Man... Man builds a good, sturdy trade

845
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,800
by hooking and crooking.

846
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,200
And then, kerplooey!

847
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,400
The gods just kick him right in the balls.

848
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:41,200
Oh, no, not this time.

849
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,200
No! No!

850
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:32,400
I got the last laugh right here.

851
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,700
Going down, now!

852
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:45,700
Going down! Going down, now!

853
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,700
Here I come, you hog bitch!

854
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,700
You hog bitch!

855
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,800
Dead end, girl. Dead end now.

856
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,100
Dead-end city.

857
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:06,600
Look at my face.

858
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:09,900
Look. Look!

859
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,200
It's like death eating a cracker,
isn't it?

860
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:37,800
No!

861
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,900
Get away from her! Get away!

862
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,800
Don't touch her! No!

863
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,000
Grandma!

864
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,300
No!

865
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:51,400
Grandma! Grandma!

866
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,300
Grandma!

867
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:58,200
Grandma!

868
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:08,400
You killed her, you hog bitch!

869
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:34,400
Die!
