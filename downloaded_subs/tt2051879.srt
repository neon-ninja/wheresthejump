1
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,888
- Man: Hey, buddy.

2
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,611
Space is great. Umm...

3
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,725
I miss you guys

4
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,121
We're a long way away now.
I can't even see, uh--

5
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,169
I can't even see Earth anymore.

6
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,166
Man:
And, uh... it's peaceful.

7
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,526
You know?

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,843
Don't tell your mom this,
but I think

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,525
I actually sleep...

10
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,166
- better up here, away from her snoring.

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,845
- Over.

12
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,769
Man #2 over radio:
Tanks B-7 and B-9 are showing

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,241
early signs of freezing. Over.

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,285
Man: What would you do
if you get out there

15
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,646
and you find nothing?

16
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,005
Well, even if we found nothing,

17
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,123
- it's in effect a discovery.

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,963
Man:
It would make me very frustrated.

19
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,128
Woman:
I know there's something there.

20
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,442
Man #2 on radio:
Check on NAV bays 3 and 4.

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,204
You might want to update...

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,851
Mission Control,
repeat please. Over.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,968
Mission Control:
Come in, Europa One.

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,167
Man #3: Do you want me
to show you how to beat 'em?

25
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,802
William, I've got some static
in the comm array feed up here.

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,645
- It looks like a radiation spike.

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,644
William:
Have you tried recycling the system?

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,882
Mission Control:
Rosa, we've lost your feed.

29
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,841
Europa One, come in.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,651
Europa One.

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,246
- Europa One.

32
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,848
Woman: These were
the last images we received

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,843
from the Europa One craft.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,207
At the time,
it had already gone farther

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,682
than any human being
had ever traveled before.

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,409
For 16 long months I've been asked

37
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,121
the simple but loaded question:
"What happened?"

38
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,042
All-- I'm sorry.

39
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,564
Woman:
We have to tell his family.

40
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,246
We can't.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,650
The communication fix
was never completed.

42
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,802
Man:
The system is fried!

43
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,406
Last sync with Mission Control
was 19 hours ago.

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,971
We're all alone now.

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,450
So what happens?

46
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,245
Do we go on?

47
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,403
I was on a plane,

48
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,767
a transatlantic flight,

49
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,207
when the mission feed went dark.

50
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,444
When I landed,
Mission Control was still saying

51
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,046
"Maybe it's just
a transmission delay."

52
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,090
But, by the time I made it
into Mission Control,

53
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,489
we were looking
at over 15 hours of dead feed.

54
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,329
After James was lost,

55
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,561
the joy of the mission,

56
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,087
the exhilaration of it all just--

57
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,606
it just left.

58
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,287
I stopped feeling
like a kid on a family trip.

59
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,964
The mission has
stretched on ahead of us,

60
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,122
somehow longer
than it had been before.

61
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,727
Man:
No one at home knows we're alive.

62
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,930
We're doing the right thing, right?

63
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,485
Absolutely.

64
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,490
Woman: Andrei, have you
looked out at Jupiter yet?

65
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,327
It's something to be excited about.

66
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,691
- Are you okay?
- Mmm.

67
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,442
You haven't said
a word to me in a week.

68
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,962
- Rosa: I woke up one morning--
- Okay.

69
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,202
I woke up at some point and...

70
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,044
didn't recognize myself.

71
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,450
Objectively, I know it's the zero g

72
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,211
and the isolation that changes you.

73
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,522
But that doesn't make it
any less strange.

74
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,207
It doesn't stop you
from slowly breaking.

75
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,923
Samantha:
I started living my life

76
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,129
in tune with the mission
that I hoped was still going on.

77
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,331
- Man: That's good.
- Andrei: Okay.

78
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,766
Man:
How's your appetite?

79
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,287
Andrei:
I'm fine.

80
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,930
Man:
And you're sleeping kind of--

81
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,411
Andrei:
I'm not.

82
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,082
Woman:
It's been a year since we lost him.

83
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,605
Tell me we can still...

84
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,844
- Good morning. I am very--
- Man: Shh shh shh.

85
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,004
We are all very excited
to be here today.

86
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,443
It has certainly been a long road

87
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,524
and all of us up here

88
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,728
started with the shared dream

89
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,604
of space and possibility.

90
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,526
And this really is a new
first-step for mankind.

91
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,802
From one perspective,

92
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,691
you can say our mission
actually began 400 years ago.

93
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,604
- That's when Galileo first saw...

94
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,969
...Jupiter and its moons
through his telescope.

95
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,851
Samantha: For something this big,
you get one shot.

96
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,970
An unmanned mission
simply wasn't going to cut it for us.

97
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,566
You put men and women into space

98
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,200
because they have strength
in the face of cosmic odds.

99
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,203
Mission Control:
Europa One is cleared for launch.

100
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,604
T-minus 10,

101
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,410
nine, eight,

102
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,289
- seven, six...
- William: All vents open.

103
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,602
- ...five, four...
- William: We're go for main engine.

104
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,371
...three, two, one.

105
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,851
William: Ignition.

106
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,850
Mission Control:
Liftoff! On the trek to Europa.

107
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,321
William:
Our engines at 98% thrust.

108
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,204
Fuel rate is nominal.

109
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,886
Mission Control:
Rolling right in zero-point-six degrees.

110
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,929
Telemetry nominal.

111
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,725
Loft at 225 meters-per-second.
Altitude, 2.3 nautical miles.

112
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,123
And in three, two, one.

113
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,049
We have good booster separation.

114
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,009
William:
Vehicle is supersonic.

115
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,810
Command module jettison in three,

116
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,765
- two, one.

117
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,242
Mission Control:
We have a good shell separation.

118
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,243
William:
Initial burn is complete.

119
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,209
Staging in three,

120
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,169
two, one.

121
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,567
Mission Control:
Copy. We have good stage separation.

122
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,529
Woman:
We have visual of command module.

123
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,644
Beginning turn for docking.

124
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,922
Mission Control:
Trajectory is good. Thrust is good.

125
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,250
Samantha: We hadn't left
near-Earth orbit since 1972.

126
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,290
Our company was tasked
with moving forward

127
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,762
where the space programs
of the 20th century had left off.

128
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,564
- Woman: 10 meters to docking.
- Samantha: I believe

129
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,722
if you have the scent
of a discovery this big...

130
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,285
- Five meters.
- ...you do not simply wait

131
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,044
and see what happens next.

132
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,009
- Contact.

133
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,605
Samantha:
You go after it.

134
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,882
Mission Control:
Copy. We are green on hard dock.

135
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,769
Locks B through D are green.

136
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,446
Connects are stable.
Repeat: We are green on dock.

137
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,968
Mission Control,

138
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,090
we are proud to report
that we are officially underway.

139
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,050
- Mission Control: Roger that.

140
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,248
We'll be here for you
when you get back.

141
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,011
We've prepped some light
traveling music for you.

142
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,006
Mission Control:
Internal cam check is a go.

143
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,691
- Must be peaceful up there.

144
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,727
Mission Control:
External cam check is a go.

145
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,567
- ¡Come on in!

146
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,807
Hello.
Please don't vote me off.

147
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,810
There's a camera.
What do ya know?

148
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,086
Reality TV.

149
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,083
Okay, Jamie, this is your own

150
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,050
personal tour of Europa One.

151
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,202
Oh look, it's you, Jamie.
Hi, Jamie.

152
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,930
"Hi, Dad."

153
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,321
Hey, Dan. You still upset
that you got the bottom bunk?

154
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,090
How did you know
I was thinking about that?

155
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,402
- I really was thinking about it.
- The top is just so much better.

156
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,686
- Dan: I was supposed to have that.
- Look at that.

157
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,604
- Here's Daniel down here...
- I'm supposed to have--

158
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,240
..."I'm so cramped."
Look at my spacious bunk.

159
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,289
- Film me for a second.
- Okay.

160
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,490
Okay, so this is actually
one of two living quarters.

161
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,803
What they do is they rotate
around the core module

162
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,970
so this gives us simulated gravity.

163
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,690
But watch this.

164
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,121
We also get to experience

165
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,931
real gravity-free

166
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,082
space excitement.

167
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,844
Whoo!

168
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,968
- And the head rush that goes with it.
- William: Crew meeting

169
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,282
- in one hour, guys.
- Okay.

170
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,847
Now the thing
about zero gravity is that

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,162
it makes our bones
and muscles really weak.

172
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,249
This is why we spend
as much time as possible

173
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,204
in these living modules.

174
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,880
Yeah, okay.
Just pass it up. I got it.

175
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,520
Okay.
And there's the lovely Katya.

176
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,409
Now these are some
of the science tools

177
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,767
that we're using to test
for life on Europa.

178
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,446
And your dad has to fix them
if any of them break.

179
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,011
When you're done playing tourist,

180
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,605
you can come over here
and help me.

181
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,127
If you're not afraid to chip a nail.

182
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,567
- James: Now-- whoa--

183
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,285
- this is the cockpit.

184
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,441
Rosa:
Mission Control...

185
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,840
...sync.

186
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,968
Mission Control:
Copy, Rosa. We have sync.

187
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,202
Man:
And Rosa, our pilot, used to fly jets

188
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,886
before she started flying us around.

189
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,168
And what's she doing?
She's setting up the camera system

190
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,164
which monitors everything
that happens on the ship.

191
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,328
Smile for Jamie, Rosa.

192
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,127
And now--
last thing I want to show you--

193
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,651
have a look at this.

194
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,161
The view.

195
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,570
Kind of ironic, really.

196
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,211
So little space in here

197
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,886
and so much space out there.

198
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,881
Whoa.

199
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,249
Samantha:
As the ship passed the moon,

200
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,765
it had already gone farther

201
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,285
than any human being

202
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,363
had ever traveled before.

203
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,403
I mean, think about that.

204
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,329
Across all of human history,

205
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,241
that moment was the farthest
anyone had ever gone.

206
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,364
But they still had millions
upon millions of miles to go.

207
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,649
Our craft was heading
for a moon of Jupiter

208
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,609
known as Europa.

209
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,009
James:
This mission is riding

210
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,931
on the shoulders
of many great men and women.

211
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,282
And so if we have any legacy at all,

212
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,363
I would hope that it would be

213
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,330
that we would inspire
those who come after us

214
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,528
to keep exploring,
to keep questioning,

215
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,409
to keep pushing the boundaries,

216
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,608
to keep looking for the answers

217
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,928
to those really tough questions--

218
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,081
Who are we?

219
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,321
Why are we here?

220
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,561
Where do we come from?

221
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,485
And... are we alone?

222
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,451
- For a very long time,

223
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,888
Europa has seemed
to be just a solid sphere of ice.

224
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,611
But even just looking at its surface,

225
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,967
there are clues, you know?
There might be water

226
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,446
underneath the ice.

227
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,761
And then in the fall of 2011,

228
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,844
scientists realized--
they released data

229
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,646
showing the presence
of sub-surface lakes--

230
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,247
of liquid! And-- wow!

231
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,289
- Wherever we have found water--

232
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,010
we have found life.

233
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,845
But what came next was, um...

234
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,411
even more startling.

235
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,801
NASA discovered heat signatures

236
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,089
under an area known
as the Conamara Chaos.

237
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,969
Well, they teased the idea that--

238
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,441
that simple mono-cellular life

239
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,491
in our solar system
might not just be possible,

240
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,051
it might be probable.

241
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,407
I wanna go to Europa
and go ice fishing.

242
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,881
Cut through the ice,
lower a submersible,

243
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,405
look around, see what's there.

244
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,803
See what swims up
to the camera lens and licks it.

245
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,406
If life exists on Europa,

246
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,325
it will be the single most profound

247
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,006
discovery in human history.

248
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,285
Rosa:
Dasque to Mission Control. Over.

249
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,408
Mission Control:
We read you, Rosa. Over.

250
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,761
Rosa:
Data sync is live.

251
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,002
Mission Control:
How's everyone holding up?

252
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,366
Daniel:
I think it's potato soup.

253
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,244
- Get something to drink.
- Dude, why--

254
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,488
why would you put garlic
into a space dish?

255
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,371
- Andrei: It's very rich.

256
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,488
- Katya: It's delicious.
- William: I have to say, though...

257
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,482
Okay, look look--
I've got another mile to go.

258
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,847
Rosa: Not bad, eh?

259
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,008
Daniel:
What about after your run?

260
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,685
When are you gonna
actually call someone?

261
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,411
- None of your business.

262
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,486
- Hey. It's time.

263
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,483
Daniel: I should have learned
Mandarin before we left.

264
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,369
- He's probably talking about us.
- Rosa: Gun it.

265
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,568
- One, two, one, two, one, two, one...

266
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,530
- Katya: How did you feel?
- William: I said yes

267
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,170
before the question had even sunk in.

268
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,289
They had to ask me four times
before I could even respond.

269
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,729
Mission Control:
No trouble on the ping requests.

270
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,531
We see a sticking valve in V-Tech.

271
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,170
Are you seeing that too? Over.

272
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,322
- Andrei is already working on a fix.

273
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,370
If it leaks any more,
we'll isolate the manifold.

274
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,048
Oh, and we have series

275
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,043
of fuse events in Rosa's station.

276
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,362
Can you have the team
on duty investigate? Over.

277
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,365
Mission Control:
Copy that. But you might have it fixed

278
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,010
before we finish the review.

279
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,288
You're making us feel
two steps behind.

280
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,010
- Over.

281
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,766
- You'll make him blush. Over.

282
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,209
- Mission Control, can you hear me?

283
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,084
Andrei is in the shower right now,
so I want to take this opportunity

284
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,323
to tell you that your shower system
is totally inadequate.

285
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,641
And I don't buy your theories about

286
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,649
the body adjusting
to the new hygiene regime.

287
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,285
You know what I can't adjust to?

288
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,329
The drinking of the distilled urine.

289
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,562
Oh! James!

290
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,761
I'm just saying--

291
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,285
you're worried about my smell

292
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,044
and you're drinking my urine?

293
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,601
You know what I think
they're really pissed off about?

294
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,047
You guys only gave them
four outfits.

295
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,964
So sometimes they wake up
in the morning,

296
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,885
they find out they're wearing
the same thing the entire day.

297
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,251
They get totally pissed off.

298
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,845
- And the shoes--

299
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,764
you gave them two pairs of shoes.

300
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,685
For women. I'm just saying.

301
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,888
Andrei:
Rosa, dinner! Where is she?

302
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,082
- Rosa: Coming.
- Daniel: Who's the lasagna?

303
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,685
- James: Yeah.
- Daniel: That's you?

304
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,241
- William: Oh God.
- Who's the pod macaroni and cheese-ish?

305
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,607
- William: I guess I'll take that.
- James: To six months!

306
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,000
- Katya: Mmm.
- All: Cheers.

307
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,446
- Okay, eyes. Eyes.
- Katya: Wait,

308
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,045
- you're not looking into my eyes.
- Oh, sorry.

309
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,050
- Katya: Can I see?
- Andrei: Did you see any polar bears?

310
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,521
- No, really.

311
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,041
Samantha: We--

312
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,521
we pulled our astronauts

313
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,127
from the very best space programs
across the globe.

314
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,846
Our captain is William Xu.

315
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,604
I think this mission
will show people that

316
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,240
we're still capable
of achieving impossible things.

317
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,811
Samantha:
Dr. Daniel Luxembourg.

318
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,123
My entire adult life has been dedicated
to exploring extreme environments.

319
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,248
And I became an astronaut specifically

320
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,925
to have the opportunity
to do something like this.

321
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,570
Samantha:
Dr. Katya Petrovna.

322
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,166
Life on Earth began in the ocean,
so in some ways

323
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,607
this mission will be like
taking a trip back in time.

324
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,122
My background is in marine biology
and oceanography.

325
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,841
To be honest,
sometimes I'm terrified of flying.

326
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,365
Samantha:
Andrei Blok.

327
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,690
I think I have
349 days in outer space,

328
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,888
so I'm what you call a veteran.

329
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,008
The only thing I can't face is...

330
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,961
- the food.

331
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,400
Samantha:
James Corrigan.

332
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,006
I remember watching
footage at school

333
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,043
of Neil Armstrong on the moon,

334
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,727
and just-- just knowing
"I want to do this."

335
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,049
- Rosa Dasque.
- Call me immature, reckless, arrogant.

336
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,330
I just want to go faster and farther
than anyone has before.

337
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,201
We had to design a spacecraft
unlike any before it.

338
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,160
Of course, once the decision
was made to put people on board,

339
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,049
the requirements ballooned.

340
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,885
Human beings need food, shelter.

341
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,725
They need an environment
that is survivable

342
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,928
and has some level of comfort.

343
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,045
It's cracking the ice.

344
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,929
Daniel:
We're a month away, Andrei.

345
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,890
We're still concerned
about your recovery.

346
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,688
So how should I be
recovering, exactly?

347
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,125
Excuse me.

348
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,800
William:
So what do you think?

349
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,802
I still wouldn't advise leaving him
in the orbiter alone for three weeks.

350
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,486
I'd rather not leave
our only engineer behind.

351
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,484
So we take him down
with us then.

352
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,646
Yeah.

353
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,486
Rosa: Jupiter.

354
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,450
Being so close to our destination
lifted our spirits.

355
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,249
It felt that everything
made sense again.

356
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,888
The thickness in the air cleared.

357
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,125
But what cleared it
was sheer adrenaline.

358
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,485
William over radio:
Prep for orbital transfer.

359
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,324
We're gonna feel some Gs here.

360
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,360
Rosa:
Pitch maneuver.

361
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,444
William:
We are clear of Jupiter's orbit.

362
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,090
Beginning orbital transfer.

363
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,604
Rosa:
Pitching for power descent.

364
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,004
William:
Daniel, can you keep Andrei abreast

365
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,884
of any of those changes
in the readouts, please?

366
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,526
- Daniel: Roger that.
- Rosa: Orbit trajectory, clear.

367
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,286
Current speed
60 kilometers per second.

368
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,688
- William: Ready?
- Rosa: Yeah.

369
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,247
William:
Surface conditions in the LZ?

370
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,562
Daniel: I've got heat plume
and radiation analysis incoming,

371
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,411
but the data is variable.
Heat is fluctuating.

372
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,925
Rosa:
Not far now.

373
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,331
Andrei: All systems online.
Showing green light.

374
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,407
William:
Landing gear armed and ready to deploy.

375
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,764
Rosa:
Ladies and gentlemen, hold on.

376
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,921
Here we go.

377
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,010
William:
Trajectory and speed?

378
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,567
Rosa:
Heading 270.3.

379
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,643
Coming in low across Thera Macula

380
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,610
at 458.4 meters per second.

381
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,409
Target site lining up.

382
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,608
Landing gear deployed.

383
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,330
William:
20 seconds to--

384
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,281
What was that?

385
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,681
Daniel: It's like a thermal vent.
Sort of an eruptive feature.

386
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,410
- Can you stabilize us?
- I'm trying!

387
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,324
Andrei, I need an option
for emergency landing.

388
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,482
Daniel: Vent's coming from the area
around our target site.

389
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,604
There's a low gradation of ice
just past the LZ, along Thrace Macula.

390
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,808
Okay. Land us long.
Get us past the vent area.

391
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,568
- Rosa: 100 meters to contact.
- William: 10 seconds of fuel.

392
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,087
Back off the burners on approach
or we'll melt our landing site.

393
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,805
Rosa:
Roger that. 10 meters.

394
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,644
- Five meters.
- William: Contact lights.

395
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,847
Rosa:
Shut down.

396
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,921
I think we've got it.

397
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,730
William:
Everything okay up here?

398
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,365
Katya: Sorry.

399
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,249
I can't pull my eyes away from it.

400
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,605
It takes your breath away.

401
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,767
That night I went out

402
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,924
and found Jupiter
in the night sky and...

403
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,731
I spent a long time
looking at it, just...

404
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,370
hoping-

405
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,564
Daniel: Surface temp in current position
is holding at absolute zero.

406
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,969
Prelim service data has us
on a bed of what looks like ice 11.

407
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,929
We should be there,

408
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,401
but we're here.

409
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,365
We flew 590 million kilometers

410
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,881
and then landed
100 meters off the mark.

411
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,530
- It seems insignificant,

412
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,445
but it will be difficult
to get useful surface analysis.

413
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,968
Sokolov: Ironically, what threw the ship
off course from the original target zone

414
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,646
was a reconfirmation
of what we had hoped for.

415
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,282
If such heat-plume eruptions were
escaping through the cracks in the ice,

416
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,762
it suggested strong underwater thermal
activity and the potential for life.

417
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,605
If they had landed on the target area,

418
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,127
which was ripe for surface analysis,

419
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,851
the mission would have begun
with extensive surface tests

420
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,764
using the ship's robotic arm,

421
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,843
followed by a few hours
of drilling through the ice

422
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,241
to deploy a remote underwater probe.

423
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,768
- So how will that affect procedure?

424
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,161
What it means is we won't get
the data we want very easily.

425
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,322
That's why I want to move back
Daniel's surface test

426
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,806
and start the drill immediately.

427
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,850
Our best hopes of success
lies under the ice.

428
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,764
Daniel, what do you think?

429
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,366
- I wanna argue...
- I'm sure you would.

430
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,488
...but with
our current position in the ice,

431
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,768
we won't get key data.

432
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,809
Let's go for a swim.

433
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,848
- Drill head is locked and prepped.

434
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,206
Beginning extension.

435
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,083
- Katya: Thermal is live.

436
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,163
Entering ice layer now.

437
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,202
- Daniel: Do you hear that?
- Uh-huh.

438
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,328
- Daniel: Are you getting it?
- Katya: Yeah.

439
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,369
Daniel:
I think that's just the ice shifting.

440
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,090
Everything's all right.

441
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,164
Katya: We can expect more of that
as the temperature drops.

442
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,489
Daniel: That was stronger
than our data projected it.

443
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,405
- William: Are we stable?
- Re-working the analysis now.

444
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,082
Katya, let's try the frequency
of these quakes.

445
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,083
Katya:
The increased tidal activity means

446
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,289
there could be more heat
than we thought beneath the surface.

447
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,723
- Daniel: Are you recording this?
- Katya: Yeah.

448
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,284
Okay, let's run
some diagnostics here,

449
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,169
because it seems
to be escalating a little bit.

450
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,488
Daniel: Might be some subsurface
aftershocks, but up here we'll be fine.

451
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,402
You saw it.

452
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,641
Huh.

453
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,524
Daniel:
You got to check out this activity.

454
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,489
- It's incredible.
- Katya: Everything's fine here.

455
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,801
What about the ECS?

456
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,486
William:
All clear?

457
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,404
- How about the hull and landing gear?
- You see this?

458
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,006
- Check out the activity. Incredible.
- Yeah, no deflection.

459
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,642
- ECS?
- William: ECS okay.

460
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,211
No problems here.

461
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,011
Andrei:
Guys, I saw something.

462
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,764
William:
What do you mean?

463
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,209
Uh, umm...

464
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,209
I saw something outside the ship.

465
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,761
From up there
through the porthole.

466
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,684
Maybe 100 meters out.

467
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,649
I tried to get a video, but I missed it.

468
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,406
It was a light down the linea.

469
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,291
I was working one of the servers
when the ice shook.

470
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,044
And... it was there.

471
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,049
William:
A light source outside the ship?

472
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,083
Andrei:
I know that I saw it.

473
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,760
- It was flickering.
- Katya: How strong was the light?

474
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,206
Well...

475
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,885
it was like an LED,

476
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,605
but dull from refraction.

477
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,491
But the-- oh, it happened so fast.

478
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,085
It was there and then it was gone.

479
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,287
You mean it moved?

480
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,205
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it moved.

481
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,442
Daniel:
I can check the heat signatures.

482
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,405
William:
Do you see anything?

483
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,609
Rosa:
I've checked this footage three times.

484
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,250
- There's nothing to see.
- Katya: Yeah,

485
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,084
but that doesn't mean
there was nothing there.

486
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,601
If it was too dim, these cameras
wouldn't have caught it.

487
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,491
Daniel: That's true.
A weak chemiluminescence maybe?

488
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,927
Triggered by shifts in the ice?

489
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,851
Katya: A chemical iridescence
doesn't fit this description.

490
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,930
Daniel: Maybe. When we prepare
the surface test, we'll know.

491
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,482
I find the idea of bacteria clinging
to the underside of the ice more likely.

492
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,042
Something that has a luminescent
response to radioactivity.

493
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,043
Yeah, but do you think
it actually moved?

494
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,770
Katya:
Scientifically I doubt it.

495
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,445
But personally, I hope so.
Daniel: Wait, did you notice that?

496
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,321
William: What?

497
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,044
Daniel:
Radiation interference.

498
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,965
It's on all the cameras.

499
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,250
Daniel:
Wait, let's take two steps back here.

500
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,607
I think there's another version
of this that we have to consider.

501
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,762
It's entirely possible
Andrei didn't see anything at all.

502
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,969
It's very dark out there and his mind
could be filling in the blanks.

503
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,009
But it could also be
our first indication

504
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,128
of exactly what
we came out here to find.

505
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,251
ls Andrei sleeping yet?
No.

506
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,081
Rosa's voice:
In those days there was a raw--

507
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,009
a raw mix of emotions.

508
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,802
We'd come so far,
weathered so much.

509
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,650
I think we were all in a place where

510
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,844
excitement blended with awe...

511
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,206
and fear.

512
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,845
- Okay, so Daniel is my witness.

513
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,571
You find a single microbe
up there and I win.

514
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,769
If you find a still-living microbe,
you win.

515
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,203
What? Evidence of extinction
doesn't win me the bet?

516
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,681
Andrei: You always find
a technicality like that

517
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,486
- for winning.
- James: No no. It's not a technicality.

518
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,927
It means that at some point
in time we were not alone.

519
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,287
Andrei:
It is a technicality.

520
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,726
- Daniel.
- What?

521
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,325
What are you doing, buddy?
What's happening?

522
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,891
- You lost something?
- I lost my toothbrush.

523
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,804
- What?
- He's unpacking his entire bunk.

524
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,961
You lost your toothbrush?

525
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,246
What color is it, man?
Did you pack it?

526
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,726
- Andrei: Oh no.
- Okay, where's my toothbrush?

527
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,450
- Andrei: We have to return to Earth.
- James: We better call housekeeping.

528
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,604
Daniel:
You should get some rest.

529
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,770
Not until I know
what I saw out there.

530
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,251
We're working on it.

531
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,880
- We'll figure it out.

532
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,408
What if I can't believe
or trust my own eyes?

533
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,810
You need to sleep.

534
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,167
We need you to sleep.

535
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,410
There's pills, sedatives.

536
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,366
Andrei:
No pills.

537
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,601
I need to stay alert.
I need to stay focused.

538
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,768
- Katya: How are you holding up?

539
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,041
Good.

540
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,003
Daniel:
We've broken through.

541
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,805
Water.

542
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,961
I'm patching in.

543
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,805
- Probe microphone live.

544
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,409
Katya: Wow. This is a completely
untouched environment.

545
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,130
Just waiting.

546
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,602
Katya:
We're so far from home, but...

547
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,127
it's like looking
at Lake Vostok right now.

548
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,886
Radiation levels
down here are minimal.

549
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,884
And there's definitely a heat source
somewhere in our target zone.

550
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,811
122 meters to heat-plume area.

551
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,486
There's 100 kilometers
of water down there.

552
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,041
It puts the trench zones
back on Earth to shame.

553
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,248
I think we're seeing
some tectonic plates here.

554
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,368
The sulfur concentration is showing

555
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,961
that the thermal vents
are closer than expected.

556
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,600
Creepy-

557
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,569
That's your scientific
assessment, is it?

558
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,960
- Daniel: Yep.
- "Creepy"?

559
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,202
- Is that the weathering of the ice?

560
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,970
Katya: Maybe.

561
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,088
Could be a bacteria.

562
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,727
Daniel:
Grabbing samples

563
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,770
and... moving on.

564
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,082
20 meters to target zone.

565
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,726
Look at how the sunlight
penetrates the ice here.

566
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,649
It must be much thinner
than we thought.

567
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,966
You hear that?

568
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,328
It could be coming
from reverberations,

569
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,847
deeper caverns caught in currents.

570
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,365
It's almost like a male whale sound.

571
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,642
Hey, a little presumptuous,
don't you think?

572
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,131
-Maybe.
- Oh yeah.

573
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,722
I've got some irregularities
in our data here.

574
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,644
Katya:
I'm getting a radiation spike.

575
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,609
Daniel:
Rosa, are you picking up on this?

576
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,888
Rosa:
There's something in the video feed too.

577
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,486
It's similar to what we saw
after the last ice shift.

578
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,570
Daniel:
That doesn't make any sense.

579
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,967
The ice should be shielding
the probe from radiation.

580
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,724
Katya:
It's not coming from above.

581
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,127
It's coming from deeper
into the target zone.

582
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,611
Daniel: Yeah.

583
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,167
Let's adjust course
and depth to investigate.

584
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,560
Katya:
Bringing us down.

585
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,564
- William: What was that?

586
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,484
Daniel:
What's our temperature down here?

587
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,290
Get ready to expand the probe arm

588
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,488
- to get samples.

589
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,927
Daniel:
What was that? Oh shit.

590
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,328
- Recycle power.

591
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,642
- All right, let's run some tests.

592
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,810
Katya: There was an abnormal shift
in the velocity of the current.

593
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,167
- Daniel: It's not reacting.
- William: Is it a remote issue?

594
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,846
- Daniel: I've lost control of it.
- Shit.

595
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,245
Andrei:
Can you play back the video?

596
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,128
William:
Did something hit the probe?

597
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,203
- What data do we have?
- Daniel: It'll take time to process,

598
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,011
- but I'll tell you right now, not much.

599
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,162
Rosa: It seemed like
it was right under the probe.

600
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,527
What was the last piece of data it sent?

601
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,648
The heat surged to 50°,

602
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,047
but that couldn't have
caused a critical...

603
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,326
- Rosa: Shit!

604
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,764
Samantha: A surface walk
was always heavily debated

605
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,161
at all stages of our mission planning.

606
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,166
And our main concern then
was the radiation from Jupiter.

607
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,567
Katya:
I will walk to the target zone

608
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,041
and I'll get the body
of samples we need.

609
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,844
Daniel:
Katya, the radiation alone--

610
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,243
The radiation is fluctuating.
It was 200 ram last time I checked.

611
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,084
I'm willing to take that risk.

612
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,765
What about everything else
that could go wrong?

613
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,081
It's 100 meters!

614
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,163
Sokolov: Having lost the probe,
the only way to get the data

615
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,084
was to explore the chaos zones

616
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,244
where the ice had cracked
and re-cracked.

617
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,564
And this process would
expose any microorganisms

618
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,410
that have been trapped inside the ice.

619
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,050
- Somebody's gotta go out there!

620
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,921
- Daniel: It's too risky.
- Enough! Enough!

621
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,243
James: I feel like it's
a critical phase and I'm not there.

622
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,283
- I just--

623
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,488
I just didn't realize
it would be this hard.

624
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,562
- Over,

625
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,126
- Daniel: Sounds like a car.

626
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,731
You know take him
to the game, if you want.

627
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,081
Umm...

628
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,522
I miss you guys. Love you.

629
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,081
Over.

630
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,966
- You Okay?

631
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,487
Yeah, I am good.

632
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,722
I'm good.

633
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,484
Not so easy, is it?

634
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,642
No.

635
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,881
No, it's not.

636
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,804
You know, my boy's gonna be
six when I see him again.

637
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,844
Daniel:
He's gonna be proud of you.

638
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,324
Andrei: What would you do if you
get out there and you find nothing?

639
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,008
Well, even if we found nothing,
it's in effect a discovery.

640
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,004
Andrei:
It would make me very frustrated.

641
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,401
Katya:
I know there's something there.

642
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,568
Mission Control:
Check on NAV bays 3 and 4.

643
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,648
Mission Control,
repeat please. Over.

644
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,404
Do you want me to show you
how to beat him?

645
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,642
Rosa: William, I've got some static
in the comm array feed up here.

646
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,370
It looks like a radiation spike.

647
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,681
William:
Have you tried recycling the system?

648
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,001
Mission Control:
Europa One, come in.

649
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,804
- Rosa, we've lost your feed.

650
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,405
Come in, Europa One.

651
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,847
- Europa One, come in.

652
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,804
Come in, Europa One.

653
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,162
Europa One, come in.

654
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,531
Europa One.

655
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,529
Mission Control:
Europa One, Europa One, do you--

656
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,440
Samantha: Now try as you might
to prepare for everything,

657
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,648
there will always be
that unknown element.

658
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,681
Samantha:
In this case a solar storm hit,

659
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,202
damaging key systems, including
communication with Mission Control.

660
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,566
Andrei:
Are you ready?

661
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,965
Okay. Oxygen is flowing.
We're good.

662
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,410
Andrei:
This never gets old.

663
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,449
James:
Okay, commencing egress.

664
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,605
James: William, I'm gonna
tether the EMUs once we're...

665
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,842
- on the hull.
- William: Roger that.

666
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,967
Samantha: Andrei and James had
to do an EVA to repair the system--

667
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,691
a bit like performing ballet
and rocket science

668
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,451
at 125,000 miles an hour.

669
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,809
James: This reminds me
of the ISS thrust fix all over again.

670
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,367
William:
5 hours, 13 minutes remaining on EVA.

671
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,727
James:
You know what time it is back on Earth?

672
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,890
Andrei:
Battery block D is non-functional.

673
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,449
William:
2 hours 55 minutes.

674
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,763
All right, I've got green lights
on the fan arrays.

675
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,729
How are we doing
on the comm power supply?

676
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,325
James:
So I said to the guy, "You know,

677
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,642
I can't just come along
and stay as long as you want.

678
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,484
You have to tell me
how long it's gonna take."

679
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,166
William: Okay, guys,
50 minutes remaining on EVA.

680
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,402
I can't keep you
out there much longer.

681
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,847
Andrei:
Panels one through six are clear.

682
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,963
- Moving onto seven.

683
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,484
James: We just need
a little more time, William.

684
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,768
I think it's a blown fuse
in the communication panel.

685
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,285
William:
You've got 37 minutes.

686
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,329
If you don't find it,
we'll need to begin regress.

687
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,887
James: Okay, we're at
the communication panel.

688
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,883
Opening up the door.

689
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,444
What do you got, Andrei?

690
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,284
James, get a look at this.

691
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,970
Whoo.

692
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,645
Andrei:
The receptors are shot.

693
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,804
James:
Yeah, William, the whole board is fried.

694
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,200
I gotta take the pins out.

695
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,361
Okay.

696
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,201
Taking out the first pin.

697
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,840
- Come on.

698
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,280
And first pin is clear.

699
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,680
Going for number two.

700
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,405
- Proceed.

701
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,010
James:
Come on.

702
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,889
Shit.

703
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,371
It's not coming.

704
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,849
Okay.
William, we've got a frozen pin.

705
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,367
William: Okay, guys,
leave that last panel for now.

706
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,800
What do you think?

707
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,765
Andrei: We can't tell
how bad it is till we get in there.

708
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,204
You sure, man? You don't want
to put heat on there first?

709
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,289
- It just feels--
- Andrei: The damage could spread.

710
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,561
- James: Okay.
- What the hell is going on out there?

711
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,366
James:
Okay. I'm set.

712
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,170
- James: Come on.

713
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,721
Ah! Shit! It snapped.

714
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,922
- The panel snapped.

715
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,367
- Andrei: I ripped my glove.

716
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,010
I ripped--

717
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,049
James:
It's okay. Andrei's okay.

718
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,486
- We're tethered.
- It's a tear of one inch.

719
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,045
- I've cut my skin.
- James: I got him hooked to me.

720
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,201
Andrei:
We're coming in.

721
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,567
Andrei, do not attempt
to climb back in on your own.

722
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,643
- James?
- I see him, I see him. I got him.

723
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,564
I'm going for him. Hang on.

724
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,245
- Andrei: It's a small rip.
- James: Take it easy.

725
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,522
- Just relax, big guy.
- William: Keep calm, Andrei.

726
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,330
- Andrei: I'm bleeding.
- William: Save your oxygen.

727
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,484
He's losing air,
but he's got his hand on it.

728
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,641
I'm bringing him in.

729
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,450
<i>' I 9011 you.</i>

730
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,045
Nice and easy.
Just relax, big guy.

731
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,850
- I got you.
- Oxygen pressure is dropping steadily.

732
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,963
- You don't have much time.

733
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,762
William: James, listen to me.
His oxygen level is red-lighting.

734
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,570
Get him back inside the ship.

735
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,922
James: Okay.

736
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,282
We're at the lock. I'm coming in.

737
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,725
Andrei:
Stop, don't go in.

738
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,726
- James: Why?
- There's something on your suit.

739
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,450
It's hydrazine.

740
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,047
Uh, guys, we've got a problem.

741
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,924
I've got hydrazine on my suit.

742
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,242
It must have hit me
when we popped the panel.

743
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,640
Andrei:
He's covered in it.

744
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,768
It's in the seams.
It's-- it's everywhere.

745
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,969
- What can we do to decontaminate?
- We can't.

746
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,646
If we bring him in,
the air in the ship will become toxic.

747
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,968
Come on. Shit.

748
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,929
We should get him in the lock,
get a v-cam reading.

749
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,367
We can't. There'd be too much risk
of lingering contamination.

750
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,488
We gotta figure out
a way to get the suit clean.

751
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,205
It's not coming out.

752
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,840
- I'm totally screwed.
- William: Andrei, get in the lock.

753
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,365
We need to depressurize
your suit now.

754
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,130
Then we'll figure out
how to get James in.

755
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,441
Seriously?!

756
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,681
Come on, man, I got--

757
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,810
I've got 20 minutes of oxygen.
ls there no way to get it clean?

758
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,447
- Andrei.
- Andrei: I'm not going in.

759
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,965
I'll get you out of the suit...

760
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,969
- What?
- ...Into the airlock.

761
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,844
You'll be out of the suit
less than two minutes.

762
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,128
- It's survivable.
- Rosa: Is that even possible?

763
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,521
Andrei:
I'll get you out of this. I'll fix it.

764
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,364
No. Andrei,
you're gonna black out, man.

765
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,965
- Andrei: No, I'm not.
- This isn't gonna work.

766
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,645
William:
James, now you're bleeding oxygen.

767
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,080
- No. No.
- Rosa: We're going to lose them both.

768
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,561
William: James, he's fading.
You have to get him in the lock.

769
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,044
Okay. Shit.

770
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,370
William:
Rosa, close the airlock now!

771
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,642
James is no longer
attached to the hull.

772
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,041
- I said close the lock!
- James: Rosa, close the lock!

773
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,762
- Rosa: Airlock is closed.

774
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,850
Oxygen is flowing.
Repressurization in 10 minutes.

775
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,082
This is insane.
You gotta go get him.

776
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,040
We can't.
By the time we'd get there, he'd--

777
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,160
James?

778
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,011
Yeah yeah yeah, I'm here. Umm...

779
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,764
Oh, Christ, I can't...

780
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,730
I'm gone.

781
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,325
Oh shit.

782
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,683
Is Andrei okay?

783
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,603
William:
Yeah. He's okay.

784
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,646
I'm sorry, James.

785
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,684
Don't be sorry.

786
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,283
It was an accident, you know?

787
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,965
Um...

788
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,002
I-- I don't have much time,
so tell Andrei...

789
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,603
tell Andrei he's a--

790
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,564
he's a crazy son of a bitch, you know?

791
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,491
And I love him for trying
to save my life and...

792
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,803
Deb and Jamie, I...

793
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,089
I love you so much.

794
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,847
Forgive me.

795
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,643
I thought I was trying to do
something great for mankind.

796
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,131
I always said it was
worth the risk but...

797
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,170
Forgive me for-- for hurting you.

798
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,891
A part of me kinda wishes I could just
float out here forever, you know?

799
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,047
James: I can't s--
I can't see anything. I can't...

800
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,565
I can't see any...

801
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,487
It's stupid to argue like this.

802
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,129
Katya, no way you can go out there
without us behind you.

803
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,611
And, William, with all due respect,

804
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,001
I think we should all
decide together how to do this.

805
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,123
I know what you think, William.

806
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,840
What about you, Daniel?

807
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,284
It's ill-advised.

808
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,886
A surface walk was
always a question mark.

809
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,281
Well, we can do it.
I'll walk the equipment out

810
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,249
and you can run
the analysis from here.

811
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,925
We can get what we came for.

812
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,082
And if she goes out there
and we never see her again?

813
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,969
- William: Think hard about that.

814
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,570
I think she should do it.
I'm sorry, William.

815
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,007
- Thank you.

816
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,041
- Andrei?
- It's too dangerous.

817
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,129
I vote no.

818
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,924
Absolutely.

819
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,964
So that's a tie then.

820
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,564
Rosa?

821
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,371
Rosa's voice: Katya made
our complete cosmic insignificance

822
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,329
seem like a call to arms.

823
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,284
What can I say?

824
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,329
She was right.

825
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,889
She's still right.

826
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,530
William:
Two hours of EVA.

827
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,165
210 meters out.

828
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,210
Search the top layer of ice
while Daniel runs analysis back here.

829
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,441
Katya:
Copy that.

830
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,246
Be careful.

831
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,926
Compared to the breadth
of knowledge yet to be known,

832
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,209
what does your life actually matter?

833
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,363
William:
30 minutes for depressurization.

834
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,083
- Katya: Batteries live.

835
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,050
William:
Switching to battery power.

836
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,089
Pressure's at 30 kPa.

837
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,890
How's your prep?

838
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,050
30 seconds to egress.

839
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,804
Good luck.

840
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,001
- Katya: I'm ready.

841
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,529
I can't believe I'm here.

842
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,200
We're here.

843
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,164
This is incredible.

844
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,840
Daniel:
Radiation is holding steady.

845
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,806
We're at 50 millisieverts per hour--
within acceptable limits.

846
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,162
Rosa: I'll check if I can
see her from upstairs.

847
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,968
Katya:
It's so still out here.

848
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,246
It's so-- I don't know what the word is.

849
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,167
- Creepy?

850
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,971
Katya: I was going to go
with "cosmically astounding."

851
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,007
I wish I could take one of these
gloves off and touch the ice.

852
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,926
- Really feel it.
- Please don't.

853
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,244
I have visual of her from here.

854
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,521
Katya: I'm heading towards
the target zone now.

855
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,564
William: We've got your back.
Life-support systems look good.

856
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,721
Daniel:
Okay, Katya, you are crossing

857
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,410
into the target zone.

858
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,766
You see that?

859
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,889
Where the ice is less deteriorated?
Just set up in the middle of that.

860
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,407
- Here?
- Daniel: Exactly.

861
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,449
She must have been
out there for an hour.

862
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,682
But it-- it felt like an eternity.

863
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,161
Each minute seemed to

864
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,681
divide and divide again
into endless moments.

865
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,445
Katya:
First sample ready for scan.

866
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,123
Sending data back to you now.

867
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,685
Are you reading?

868
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,604
Daniel:
Running analysis, stand by.

869
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,651
Daniel: We're negative for trace
carbon and chemotropic processes.

870
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,049
Can you try ice
with more trace rust?

871
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,725
Rosa:
You could feel...

872
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,003
every minute is somehow longer
than it had ever been before.

873
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,807
- Katya: Let's give it another shot.
- Daniel: Why don't you take

874
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,530
the equipment down
the linea to zone three?

875
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,004
William:
Radiation is trending upwards, Katya.

876
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,770
You've been out there 70 minutes.

877
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,490
Katya:
We're so close.

878
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,483
How much time
can you give me, William?

879
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,007
William: You've only got time
for a few more sample sets.

880
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,482
William: All right, Katya,
it's time to come back.

881
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,886
Katya: Okay.

882
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,001
I'm digging out a sub-surface sample
that isn't radiation blasted.

883
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,848
Are you guys seeing this?

884
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,525
- Here.

885
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,207
I'm getting imaging... now.

886
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,680
- It's a unicellular organism,

887
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,043
something akin to an algae.

888
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,731
I knew it.

889
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,889
- What is it?
- I don't know for sure, but...

890
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,690
I mean, it's not like it has a name.

891
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,047
Katya: It looks like
something Precambrian to me.

892
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,601
That's my first guess
on an Earth-based analogue.

893
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,888
I don't believe it.

894
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,644
We did it.

895
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,287
Daniel: Okay, Katya,
let's get you back into the ship

896
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,801
- and sort out this data.
- Katya: Packing up.

897
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,047
I hope the champagne's ready.

898
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,280
Look at that.

899
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,808
Do you guys read
that light in the distance?

900
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,931
William:
We're not reading anything.

901
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,441
It looks like some kind
of chemical iridescence.

902
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,807
I'm going to get closer to investigate.

903
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,405
Daniel: Reserve oxygen
will give her another 90 minutes.

904
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,647
William: Okay, Katya.
Proceed with caution.

905
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,007
I can't see her.

906
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,049
She's moving farther out.

907
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,926
Katya:
It's beautiful.

908
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,483
Andrei.
This looks like it could be

909
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,961
the light you were describing.

910
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,807
- I can see it again.

911
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,968
Can you check on my readouts?

912
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,640
Daniel:
it's-- it's-- it's-- it's hard to say.

913
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:00,086
I mean maybe there's
other microbial organisms

914
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,242
out there that eat through the ice.

915
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,210
This is a much more complex
ecosystem

916
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,283
than we'd previously thought.

917
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,722
I wanna see
if it's reacting to my lights.

918
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,171
I'm going to turn them off.

919
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,645
I'm going to get closer.

920
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,689
William:
Hold that action, Katya.

921
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,724
Katya, do you read me?

922
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,008
We have severe
electromagnetic interference.

923
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,525
William:
Did you see that?

924
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,045
She has to come back.

925
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,326
Katya:
...have visual.

926
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,562
I'm going to try to get it back.

927
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,330
I'm seeing it through the ice.

928
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,529
I think it's some sort
of bioluminescence.

929
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,404
Daniel:
We've got the data, Katya.

930
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,602
Heat and radiation levels
are moving with it.

931
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,888
I can't wrap my head around this.

932
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,280
It's...

933
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,050
Katya:
Okay, the ice is thin here,

934
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,168
but it seems stable. If I get close,

935
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,931
- I should be able to get a better look.
- William: Keep your line open.

936
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,570
I want to know
what's happening out there.

937
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,926
- Katya: The ground is not stable!

938
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,242
- The ice is breaking.

939
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,807
Katya, can you hear me?
Come back to the ship now!

940
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,247
It's cracking the ice!

941
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,370
- My foot is...

942
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,210
- Katya, do you read me? Come in!
- Andrei: Get her back in!

943
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,442
- Get her back in!
- Katya, come in. Do you read me?

944
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,284
- She's not listening.
- Rosa, do you see her out there?

945
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,930
Rosa:
Nothing. Just the ice.

946
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,801
- She's under the ice.
- William: What?

947
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,248
Under the water.

948
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,128
We've still got her helmet cam.

949
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,330
Daniel:
Whatever it was,

950
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,801
it was reacting
to the light on her helmet.

951
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,884
That's the behavior
of a complex organism.

952
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,324
Rosa:
The logs, the data--

953
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,841
they don't show
any proof of complex life.

954
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,729
We can't leave until we have that.

955
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,766
Andrei: We don't know how long
we'll be stable here.

956
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,366
William:
And we've lost two of our crew.

957
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,170
Andrei:
If we never leave,

958
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,051
no one on Earth will ever
know what we discovered.

959
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,211
I agree.

960
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,044
We need to leave now.

961
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,411
When the next launch window opens,
we take off.

962
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,004
Andrei: Mmm.

963
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,367
I want all the data secured
and double-checked...

964
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,047
- especially everything Katya found.

965
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:55,201
- Rosa: T-minus 32 seconds to liftoff.

966
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,124
Prepping for ascent ignition.

967
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,125
Orbital sync is established.

968
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,602
Docking operation
in t-minus eight minutes.

969
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,126
- William: Give me a systems check.
- Engine temperature's rising.

970
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,282
- William: Andrei?

971
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,763
Andrei:
Booster 3 is stuck at 30%.

972
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,365
William:
We've got to launch now.

973
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,604
Rosa:
Launch in three, two, one.

974
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,601
What the hell?
I can't keep it steady.

975
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,888
Our trajectory is way off course.

976
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,403
- The injectors are melting!

977
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:00,121
We've got engine mixture ratio errors
in engines two and three.

978
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,647
Daniel:
We're nowhere near orbital transfer!

979
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,801
Andrei: Hey!

980
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,609
Rosa:
I can try to correct course at apogee.

981
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,762
- The vernier thrusters might do it!
- Daniel: We need to shut

982
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,843
- the valves down!
- Get us back down on the surface.

983
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,002
- What?
- Don't engage the second burn.

984
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,810
You mean crash us?

985
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,961
Andrei:
What's happening up there?

986
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,489
- Andrei: Valves dow-

987
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,049
William:
2,000 meters.

988
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,161
1900.

989
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,685
I can't keep it steady.

990
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,365
Computer's unable to rectify.

991
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,609
Still dropping!
Coming in too fast!

992
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:52,891
What are you doing? William!

993
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,122
- William!
- I'm going to slow us down.

994
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,884
- I'm going to blow the water shielding.

995
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,286
- It'll create... thrust!

996
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,727
- Brace for impact!
- Daniel: 200 meters!

997
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,810
- Andrei? Andrei?

998
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,611
- Huh?
- Wake up, wake up!

999
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:37,323
- Rosa: William?

1000
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,762
- Okay

1001
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,964
Daniel:
He's dead.

1002
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,645
Rosa:
He saved us.

1003
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,122
Rosa's voice:
Europa wasn't ready to let us go yet.

1004
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,724
It quickly became apparent that

1005
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,121
we crashed
into the original landing zone.

1006
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,562
Ironic, I suppose.

1007
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,405
- Sokolov: This zone was much warmer,

1008
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,042
much more active than
any previous data had suggested.

1009
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,771
Underwater vents
had rendered the ice brittle

1010
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,161
and unstable and constantly shifting

1011
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,845
And then you add onto that

1012
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,207
William had jettisoned
the water shielding

1013
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:32,204
on descent and that had saved them,

1014
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,931
but it also left them

1015
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,924
dangerously exposed to radiation.

1016
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,970
- Andrei: We're leaking oxygen.

1017
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,645
And we're also losing heat--

1018
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,485
three degrees
since I started checking.

1019
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,725
If I would bet,
we'll freeze before we suffocate.

1020
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,124
The exterior light should be working.

1021
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,123
Daniel, can you check?

1022
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,450
- Daniel?
- Daniel: I am.

1023
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,521
It's not good.

1024
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,362
The ice is cracking under the ship.

1025
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,647
You can almost see
the ice/water interface.

1026
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,722
We're gonna be under the ice
in a matter of hours.

1027
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,889
Rosa: Our last shot
is docking with the orbiter...

1028
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,722
and using its back-up
life-support systems.

1029
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,884
Andrei: If the propulsion system
is still alive...

1030
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,482
I can get us into orbit.

1031
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,204
Come help me.

1032
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,925
It's pointless.

1033
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,846
- Rosa: Is this what you're looking for?

1034
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,162
Yeah. Thank you.

1035
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,446
Shit!

1036
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,928
- Are you all right?
- Daniel: The ice broke through.

1037
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,600
This is it. It's happening.

1038
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,365
It's the end.

1039
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,841
Rosa:
We'll find a way.

1040
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,610
We have to.

1041
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,807
Andrei:
The fuel line is partially frozen.

1042
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,849
That caused the loss of thrust.

1043
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,923
Daniel:
We're lodged in the ice.

1044
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,491
Can we even take off properly?

1045
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,244
Rosa:
If we time it right, maybe.

1046
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,482
Two hours
is the fastest we can fix it,

1047
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,802
but that is if...

1048
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,327
two of us is working on it.

1049
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,323
- You mean the three of us?
- Andrei: No.

1050
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,608
You have to stay inside,
prep engines.

1051
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,885
The fix must happen
outside the ship.

1052
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,566
- Rosa's voice: That was that.

1053
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,926
Are you ready?

1054
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,769
- Are you?

1055
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,729
Rosa's voice:
Daniel and Andrei entered the airlock

1056
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,564
for final de-pressurization.

1057
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,130
- Here.

1058
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,803
Two hours.

1059
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,201
Then I'll see you both
back here. Yeah?

1060
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,046
- Rosa's voice: And that...

1061
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,410
...brings us to now.

1062
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,568
If we don't make it...

1063
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,604
this record...

1064
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,050
one day...

1065
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,089
Just in case.

1066
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,890
Just in case.

1067
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,407
Depressurization complete.

1068
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,801
Rosa:
Pressure is 25 kilopascals.

1069
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,285
Daniel:
I'll go first,

1070
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,090
make sure the ice is stable.

1071
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,483
- Daniel: Beginning egress.

1072
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,005
Roger that.

1073
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,963
Rosa:
System signals are strong.

1074
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,968
- Daniel: The hatch is open.

1075
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,164
Oh shit.

1076
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,325
The ladder is a bit skewed,

1077
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,323
but I think I can make it.

1078
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,763
The ice beneath the ship is cracked,

1079
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,843
but it looks sturdy.

1080
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,883
Taking my first step now.

1081
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,928
- Rosa: Be careful.

1082
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,651
We're picking up
the same radiation signature.

1083
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,844
Okay. Taking my first step now.

1084
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,002
- I am on the ice.

1085
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,490
Oh God. I can feel it--

1086
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:06,124
Andrei:
Daniel? Daniel?!

1087
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,328
- Do you read me?
- Andrei: Daniel?!

1088
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,008
Daniel? Andrei?

1089
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,090
Talk to me!

1090
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,801
Andrei:
Rosa, turn off the exterior lights.

1091
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,691
- Turn off the exterior lights!
- Okay.

1092
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,525
Rosa:
I'm getting nothing.

1093
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,449
His mike is dead.
His camera is dead.

1094
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,165
He just vanished.

1095
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,126
Do you read me?

1096
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,210
What the hell
is going on out there?

1097
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,401
Andrei:
I don't know.

1098
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,408
What?

1099
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,643
I lost him. I lost him.

1100
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,928
The ice cracked beneath him.

1101
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,248
Daniel? Daniel?

1102
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,448
He was surrounded by lights,

1103
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,170
then he was gone.

1104
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,889
Tell me...

1105
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,928
tell me we can still
patch the fuel line.

1106
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,449
Andrei?
Say something.

1107
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:42,402
- Andrei?
- We can't.

1108
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,562
There's one thing still worth trying.

1109
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,966
The communication array
is still salvageable.

1110
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,167
I can fix it if I take parts

1111
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,004
from the life support.

1112
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,731
I don't know.

1113
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,802
Andrei:
Can you still prep data sync?

1114
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,928
Rosa, we can do this.

1115
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,211
How will I know when?

1116
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,125
When I remove life-support batteries

1117
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,248
you'll lose power
in the command module.

1118
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,721
- Then data sync...

1119
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,889
Andrei:
Keep talking to me.

1120
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,008
Keep the line open.

1121
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,600
It's dark.

1122
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,046
It's not gonna be easy.

1123
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,611
- Rosa: Andrei?

1124
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,250
I've lost your camera again.

1125
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,841
- Andrei: Can you hear me?
- Uh-huh.

1126
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,729
- Okay.
- Andrei: It's not far.

1127
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,370
- Rosa: Camera's back up.

1128
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,603
- Andrei: 10 paces...

1129
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,964
Andrei?

1130
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,645
Come on, come on.

1131
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,566
Andrei, I can see the light behind you.

1132
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,401
Hurry, please.

1133
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:55,004
Andrei:
I can see water under the ship.

1134
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,288
Come on, hold on.

1135
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,685
Rosa:
Another malfunction.

1136
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,644
I need to check the drives.

1137
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,285
Work, please.

1138
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,442
- It's just one more tweak and I'm done.
- Andrei?

1139
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,246
Do you read me?
Do you read me?!

1140
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,161
Andrei:
There's a cabinet in the cockpit...

1141
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,448
...that I've been working with.

1142
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,125
Join the wires...

1143
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,090
and the systems will start.

1144
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,248
Command module is just about dead.

1145
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,680
We're losing cameras here.

1146
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:36,727
I'm moving to the...

1147
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,441
Andrei?

1148
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,724
I'm connecting the wires.

1149
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,170
Almost there. Almost there.

1150
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,211
Rosa, it's working!

1151
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,407
It's working!

1152
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,963
- Rosa: Oh God.
Running out of time!

1153
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,931
Communications are up.

1154
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,009
- You did it!

1155
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,443
Andrei: You need to see this!
Are you getting this?!

1156
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,160
The luminescence is
all around the ship now!

1157
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,322
Rosa:
The exterior cameras are dying.

1158
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,330
Andrei:
Can you hear me?

1159
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,005
Andrei?

1160
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,324
Andrei:
The ship is sinking into the ice! Oh!

1161
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,281
Andrei?

1162
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,404
Do-- do you read? Andrei?

1163
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,805
Andrei, do you read?
Talk to me. Talk to me.

1164
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,006
Andrei, talk to me!

1165
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,407
Rosa's voice: Compared to the breadth
of knowledge yet to be known...

1166
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,360
...what does your life
actually matter?

1167
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,963
Samantha:
In those final moments,

1168
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,771
knowing communication
had been re-established,

1169
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,049
Rosa chose to open the airlock.

1170
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,284
I got the call at 3:00 a.m.

1171
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:58,489
telling me that communication
had been re-established.

1172
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,450
By the time I got
into our mission control

1173
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,489
our servers were flooded
with images of our crew.

1174
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,522
Our mission
had finally come back to us.

1175
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,047
We saw the sacrifices
they made for each other

1176
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,441
to keep the mission alive,

1177
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:29,086
to push the discovery further.

1178
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,608
And that final image--

1179
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,524
startling.

1180
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,842
Terrifying. Completely beyond

1181
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,287
our wildest theoretic models.

1182
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,129
The discovery of this creature

1183
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,011
is simply extraordinary.

1184
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,202
We now know that our universe

1185
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,204
is far stranger, far more alive

1186
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,044
than we had ever imagined.

1187
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,044
The crew of Europa One

1188
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,441
changed the fundamental context

1189
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,371
in which all of humanity
understands itself.

1190
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:11,449
I don't know what
greater measure of success

1191
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,045
- they could have achieved.

1192
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,328
- Is this smiling? Smiling?
- Wet your lip.

1193
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,403
- Yeah.
- Rosa: Uh-huh.

1194
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,562
One, two...
