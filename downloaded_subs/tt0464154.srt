1
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,239
Oh... boy...

2
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,824
That's a fast fish.

3
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,785
C'mon... C'mon! C'mon!

4
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,537
Look at that!

5
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,748
Son of a bitch!

6
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,114
Help...!

7
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,200
Help me...!

8
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:24,306
PIRANHA

9
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,939
Officer! It was a mistake.

10
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,065
Can't we work something out here?

11
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,692
No! Mistake or no mistake.
you just destroyed public property.

12
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,110
And from the smell of your breath!

13
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,570
I suggest you take the ticket.

14
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,905
Maybe get a ride home with your friends.

15
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,533
Oh, I don't know, I was kinda
hoping you might drive me home.

16
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,494
Touching a officer's uniform is consider assault?

17
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:51,828
Are you aware of that?

18
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,871
C'mon...

19
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,248
You look pretty hot in a tan.

20
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:58,293
It's not tan...

21
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,336
It's beige.

22
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,589
Hey, you think you can take it easy on us?

23
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,132
You boys take one more step!

24
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,968
You'll be pissing lightning bolts into next week.

25
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,052
Okay!

26
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,113
Yeah! Pretty much your everyday in college.

27
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,239
Kelly! Hey! Hmm...

28
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,907
I wasn't sure you were coming back...

29
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,159
for spring break.

30
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,286
Yeah! I'm... I'm here.

31
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,957
I can only assume you're here to
get on one of those boats.

32
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,125
No, no...

33
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,253
I came down here to pick up
my little sister for music lessons.

34
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,337
How bout yourself?

35
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,423
I'm just waiting for my ride.

36
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,509
Todd and his friends... We're gonna
go check out some music.

37
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,677
Todd Dupree?

38
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,388
Remind me who you going out with again?

39
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:54,516
Guy have standards alright!
That's all I'm saying.

40
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,728
Look! Todd's a really good DJ.

41
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,232
Kelly!

42
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,650
Let's go! Jump in, we're late!

43
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,447
Listen! He says he's got backstage passes for "Planners".

44
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,156
You should come.

45
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,824
Yeah I would...

46
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,577
But I'm pretty much under house arrest
watching Zana and Laura...

47
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,077
Then too bad.

48
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,872
I'll miss ya.

49
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,624
Anyway look! I'd gotta go.

50
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:19,541
C'mon! Let's go!

51
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,253
Yeah, yeah and hopefully I'll see
you again before you...

52
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,588
or you'll leave...

53
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,590
Gonna make a move, Jake.

54
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:30,010
Hey! Asswipe!

55
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,512
Cool shirt!

56
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,398
Nice horn.

57
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,316
Thanks.

58
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,276
Nice boobs.

59
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,070
Thanks

60
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,196
I have a training bra...

61
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,447
but I do not like to wear it.

62
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,573
Cos it itches.

63
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,450
Tell me about it.

64
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,912
Who're you waiting for?

65
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,872
My brother Jake. He's 17.

66
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,833
He'll like your boobs too.

67
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,834
They all do.

68
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:02,960
C'mon Laura, let's go.

69
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,378
What happened to you?

70
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,588
Look. I don't want to talk
about it okay. Let's go.

71
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:07,840
Hi Jake!

72
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,551
Try not to stare at her boobs.

73
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,593
Shut up.

74
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,179
I like your shirt.

75
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,056
Why? You want to throw something at me too?

76
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,767
No! Actually I like The Pixies.

77
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,768
Danni, Danni...

78
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,436
Where the hell is Crystal?

79
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,312
She's over there with Andrew...

80
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:23,981
They're gettin sunscreen.

81
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:24,815
We're just waiting.

82
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:25,774
Sunscreen?

83
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,693
Andrew! Crystal! we don't need sunscreen!

84
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,111
We need body paint! We need condoms!

85
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:30,112
We need ready whip!

86
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,196
You tell her 10 am tomorrow.

87
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,949
I want her bleached, blonded, booty at the marina.

88
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,450
Gonna get off my first shot by noon.

89

So bright and early baby!

90
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,871
Make sure those tities are nice and perky!

91
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,582
Who's this?

92
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,625
This is Jake.

93
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,668
He's a lifeful.

94
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:46,920
A sandrat huh?

95
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,672
You know your way around the lake?

96
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:49,756
Aah... Yeah!

97
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,633
You wanna job? I pay cash money.

98
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,051
Don't bullshit me Jake.

99
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,596

00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,430

101
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,139
Somebody with...

102
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,015
Ambition,

103
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,892
Someone who's willing to take chances...

104
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,476
... If you know what I mean.

105
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,979

106
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,023

114
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,578

115
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,121
He's the director.

116
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,248
Oh! So you're like a ...

117
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,708

119
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,381

00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,688
I need you.

130
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,691
We're talking life lessons here, Jake.

131
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:51,818
Great!

00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,612
Don't be late.

00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,906
And... wear a different shirt.

135
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,617
Guess we see you tomorrow Jake.

136
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,369
Actually! tomorrow he's ...

137
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:34,778
Jake?

138
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,531
Why you're gonna knock if
you're just gonna walk in?!

139
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,741
Am I disturbing you?

140
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,659
No, I'm just...

141
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,244
doing homework and...

142
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:45,122
and school work and research for school.

143
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:47,875
Laura!

144
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,544
Have been telling me that you may have
some other plans...

145
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,461
for tomorrow.

146
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,297
No! What's she talking about...

147
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,548
I'm a 100% baby sitting.

148
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,426
What? No, no... we don't want a babysitter!

149
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,136
Yeah mom! Especially not Jake.

150
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:00,971
Please...
- especially not Jake...

151
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:01,805
I'm serious.

152
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,016
No! We don't need one now!
- Get out, out, out!

153
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:04,850
Out...

154
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,895
Mom! C'mon... Please! We have to talk about this...

155
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:08,687
Mom...

156
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,231
Jake, you know I do not have a backup.

157
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,817
Yeah I know mom.

158
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,153
Yeah don't worry. I know how
crazy this week is for you.

159
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,237
And...

160
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,448
I'll take care of the nitwits, okay.

161
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,075
Remember, if you do not fulfill your responsiblity...

162
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,328
I have the power to arrest and...

163
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,537
and imprison you.

164
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:27,080
Mom, I'm not 12 okay.

165
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,208
playing the sheriff card isn't gonna work anymore.

166
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,335
No?
- No.

167
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,296
Like I said, I'll take care of it okay?

168
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,256
Alright.

169
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,633
Better.

170
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,967
Get outta here.

171
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,553
Alright... Well next year I'll try to find another solution.

172
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,679
Alright.
- Alright!

173
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,722
Okay.

174
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,898
Oh! And Jake?

175
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:53,941
Oh mom! C'mon on!

176
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,943
Really!

177
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,401
It's time for dinner.

178
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,695
Alright, alright... I'll be right there.

179
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,558
I hope I didn't wake the kids.

180
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,601
Oh god! They'll sleep thru anything.

181
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,980
So Maggie said that yesterday was
last time she saw them?

182
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,273
Yeah, just before noon.

183
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:37,401
She said Matt took the boat out to catch some bass.

184
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:40,153
She drove around the lake all night looking for him.

185
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,739
Where's the boat?
- Over there.

186
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,421
You feeling like a skinnydip?

187
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,882
Yeah, I think we can make it to the end of the pier.

188
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:00,549
Meaning what?

189
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,134
I'm too old or I'm too heavy?

190
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,886
I think you're too chickenshit.

191
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,183
By the way, Gordon called last night.

192
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:09,975
Yeah?

193
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,521
He said the USGS recorded a heavy
seismic activity beneath the lake.

194
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:15,606
Really?

195
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,692
They're sending in a team of seismologist divers.

196
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:19,735
Alright!

197
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,613
And he said you will escort them out.

198
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,032
Jesus Christ.

199
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,075
Just been invaded by 20,000 kids...

200
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,244
makes us a little busy at the moment.

201
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,787
You know. That's what I told them.

202
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,791
This doesn't sound too good.

203
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,100
So what time is the divers...

204
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,560
gonna get here?

205
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,394
He said about 10.

206
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,248
Shit.

207
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:20,963
C'mon just a little more.

208
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,508
Can't get it.

209
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,601
Give me your hand!

210
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:44,820
You think a propeller could have done it?

211
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:45,279
I doubt it.

212
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,030
Look at the bones, nothing's broken.

213
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,449
It's like something acidic...

214
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,285
or toxic decomposition.

215
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,911
Well if the body's been in the water for weeks.

216
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,500
What would you say if I was thinking about closing the lake?

217
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,336
You know, just until we get an autopsy report.

218
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,256
The autopsy report is gonna take a couple of days.

219
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,426
It'll be easier to drain this lake then to close it.

220
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,386
It's a big financial week for our town.

221
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,182
Too old for this.

222
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,293
We're not lying to mom.

223
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,878
Yeah! We're not lying to mom.

224
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:25,337
Come on guys...

225
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,588
every year it's the same thing.

226
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:27,631
I'm stuck here with you guys while...

227
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,883
I miss all spring break fun.

228
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,010
You mean spring break boobies?

229
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,471
What if I give you guys the cash for babysitting?

230
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,056
Sixty dollars and you got a deal.

231
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,933
Sixty! I'm only getting paid forty!

232
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:40,143
Twenty dollars deception surcharge.

233
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,192
Do not pickup the phone.

234
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,193
Do not answer the door.

235
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:51,238
And do not leave the house.

236
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,240
Okay? I'm counting on you guys.

237
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:53,866
Alright?

238
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:25,898
Hi!

239
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:27,774
After the dive.

240
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,693
Our presence is requested at the Kokamo's.

241
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,528
By the Arizona State Cheerleading team.

242
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,363
Hi! I'm Sherffi Forester.

243
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:35,324
Bob Gordon asked me to take you out to the site.

244
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:36,074
Very good to meet you.

245
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,868
I love the welcoming committee around here.

246
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,786
I assume that's technical equipment too?

247
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:42,080
Yes, Sam! Give those back.
C'mon.

248
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:44,958
According to the epicentre coordinates...

249
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,003
we need to go... here.

250
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,589
Okay.

251
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,008
It's about 20 minutes out.

252
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,176
Ready when you are.

253
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,219
Alright.

254
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:01,558
So you don't see many women working law
enforcement out here in cowboy country.

255
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:02,893
You see a lot of cowboys though.

256
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,353
Yeah, Sure.

257
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:41,408
Kelly!

258
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,034
Jake!

259
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:46,538
Who exactly are you babysitting here?

260
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,707
Well, it's a ...

261
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,375
It's a funny story actually, I...

262
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,418
I say tit!

263
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:52,586
You say eat!

264
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,046
Tit!
- Eat tit!

265
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:57,883
Look at those idiots.

266
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,426
It's a... terrible.

267
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:01,220
Sandrat!

268
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:02,930
Hey! Sandrat!

269
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:03,889
I'm talking to you.

270
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:04,932
SANDRAT!

271
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:05,974
Hello!

272
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:06,517
Where the hell have you been?

273
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:07,559
We got these girls souped up.

274
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,477
We're ready to roll!

275
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:09,770
I'm docking your paycheck!

276
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,979
C'mon! Let's go.

277
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,022
Okay!

278
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,736
Now I see what you've been
scouting in the last 15 minutes.

279
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:21,448
Well! Kelly it's nice to see you.
I know you gonna get going.

280
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:22,282
Kelly! Kelly.

281
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,076
Hi! I'm Derrick Jones.

282
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,118
Hi!

283
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,079
You know this guy?

284
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:28,622
Jake!

285
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:31,291
"Jake is my boy"!

286
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,917
Jake is the man with the plan!

287
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,460
The inside, the knowledge!

288
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:34,670
Yeah wait!

289
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,548
Those girls aren't with you,
are they?

290
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:40,551
Yeah! why? Are you into girls?

291
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,678
No, I'm just showing him around town...

292
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,346
ya know just all the hot spots.

293
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:45,389
Jake, jake, jake...

294
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,599
The job is called location scout and...

295
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,434
Kelly you should come with!

296
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:52,020
Today we're gonna be making movie history.

297
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,481
No! She's got other plans already.

298
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:56,692
Kelly do you like champagne?

299
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,240
I... I love champagne,

300
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,241
actually I love...

301
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,325
No, no, no! Wait a second!

302
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,245
I would love come on your boat Derrick,
thank you.

303
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:08,996
I mean...

304
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,914
Someone have to keep an eye
on the man with the plan here.

305
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:12,207
Right! Sand RAT!

306
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,250
C'mon, c'mon...

307
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,169
Let me... let me help you aboard.

308
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:16,461
Why! Why...

309
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:19,131
Hey! Todd, That's Kelly.

310
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,217
Hi Kelly! baby.

311
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:24,803
What happened to...

312
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:26,180
ya know hanging with us today?

313
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,931
Is that your boyfriend or something?
- No, no, no

314
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,224
He's just some guy from the school,

315
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:32,019
someone whom he said to have
backstage passes when he actually doesn't.

316
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,313
Have a good day Todd!
- C'mon Kelly!

317
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,814
Go on, have a T-shirt.

318
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:40,694
What the fuck?!

319
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:41,445
That's Derrick Jones...

320
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,405
Is it Jake Forrester?

321
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:46,116
Oh... fuck me...

322
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,660
Alright! We are off to shoot some wild porn...

323
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:53,165
royal like with these "Wild Wild Goddesses" !!

324
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:56,543
But we will see you all...

325
00:22:56,543 --> 00:23:00,005
4 o'clock Canyon Beach for the Lake Victoria wet t-shirt...

326
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:03,884
"Wild Extravaganza"!!

327
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,261
We told Dave we would stay in the house.

328
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:07,971
We told Jack that we'll stay home.

329
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,516
I told him I'd fish.

330
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,601
I can't if there aren't any.

331
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:13,977
The lake too busy!.

332
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,063
C'mon! Sand Island is really close.

333
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:30,035
I should've brought my trombone.

334
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,248
No way! Girl! Sunbath or something.

335
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,416
Well when I become a rock star...

336
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,086
see if I like you be in one of my groupies.

337
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,463
Give me a break dude!

338
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:44,132
You PLAY the trombone!

339
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:56,687
Alright ladies here we go...

340
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:59,064
a little bubbly!
- Thank you.

341
00:23:59,064 --> 00:23:59,815
Here you go!

342
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,985
Finest's your... Shinaz has to offer.

343
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:03,902
You're kidding.

344
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:07,072
Here we go... yeah!

345
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,115
Drink up. Crystal.

346
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:11,034
Yeah!
Join and cheers!

347
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:11,952
Cheers!

348
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,163
To our newest ''Wild Wild" Number.

349
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,457
You are beautiful.

350
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:20,377
That's why we came here.
Derrick wants to capture innocence.

351
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:22,379
It's all about innocence.

352
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:24,131
Just like her.

353
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,930
Alright! Derrick's just making his play.

354
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,349
He might as well ask me out to breathe.

355
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:38,103
Show a girl a camera and she WILL perform.

356
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,855
It's like a law of physics.

357
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:41,857
I've seen that guy charm the pants off a lot of ladies.

358
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,194
She's not messing up your party! Is she?

359
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:47,279
Like I care. She's not my girlfriend.

360
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,322
Oh! And...

361
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:51,074
I'm.. This is great. I'm having a great time...

362
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,117
We're... going wild...

363
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:55,078
I'm... going wild.

364
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,080
Hey, Jake! How far is this place?!

365
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,290
C'mon!

366
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:00,125
Yeah, yeah we're almost there!

367
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,087
So speaking of going wild?

368
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,424
You haven't seen anything yet.

369
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:30,656
Jake!

370
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:32,699
Jake.

371
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:33,742
Yeah?

372
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:38,288
Jake!

373
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:47,297
Why don't you put it somewhere...

374
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:49,216
Anyway you want.

375
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:54,096
Crystal! He's not even legal.

376
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,908
Hey, what's up guys?

377
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:58,118
Jake! Close that door! You're ruining our shot!

378
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:01,455
C'mon sandrat! Get with the program here.

379
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,873
Here they come, here they come!

380
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:04,625
Here come's my nymphs.

381
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:08,212
Oh my god!

382
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:10,547
Here we go!

383
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,509
Check it out!
The fish with boobies.

384
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,345
If fish looked like that! I would fuck fish!

385
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:18,263
I would only fuck fish!

386
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:19,932
Here we go...

387
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:21,600
Looking good ladies.

388
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,935
You like this right? Jake?

389
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:25,896
You're the one that should be paying us today,
not the other way around.

390
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,607
Zoom in. Zoom, zoom, zoom...

391
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:30,734
Get that ass.

392
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:33,779
Look at these Goddess of product...

393
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:34,988
bitches. This is hot Andy!

394
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,074
This is so hot! This is what it's all about!

395
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:41,453
Beer, sun and naked honeys making out underwater!

396
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:49,253
Better than any aquarium YOU been to sandrat!

397
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,133
Uh... mom! Hey! Umm...

398
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,176
Mom?

399
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,594
What... what's going on out over there? Cuz...

400
00:27:58,262 --> 00:27:59,304
Naked fishes!

401
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,015
Well then how come you didn't pickup the home phone?

402
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:03,767
Ya know! I've been trying to reach you.

403
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:05,894
Why? I... I...

404
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:07,312
I'm sorry we've just been outside.

405
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:10,399
But I... I can get them if you need me to.
- Crystal! spin around!

406
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:12,317
No, no that's okay.

407
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:17,156
Oh my god!

408
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:18,448
What?

409
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,286
Nothing, nothing it's just the...

410
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:23,996
It just the kids. They're...

411
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,748
Just pushed the tent outside and...

412
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:27,916
I... I...

413
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:30,586
It just really nice to see them...

414
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:32,671
to see them playing with each other.

415
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,215
Put you ass on the glass!

416
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:36,008
Yeah!

417
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:36,383
Your...cho...

418
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:37,426
Choucha!

419
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,344
Jake? Is someone there with you?

420
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:43,599
No, no, no. It's just the...

421
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,683
It's just the kids on the lake!

422
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:46,393
It's crazy here, you know how it is.

423
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:49,479
Honey, I do not want to Zane or Laura near the lake today,

424
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,522
Do you hear me?

425
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:52,691
Alright! Okay. We'll stay in and...

426
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:55,360
We'll watch some TV. Whatever's on okay!

427
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,198
Alright! I gonna go. Thank you so much for this.

428
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,700
I'll try really hard to be home early, okay?

429
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,036
Yeah. Alright, alright I love you.

430
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:05,078
Okay I gonna go!

431
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,415
Kelly?

432
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:15,130
Kelly, where are ya?!

433
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:22,262
Kelly?

434
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:27,434
Kelly?

435
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:14,690
Jake!

436
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,316
You just missed the rest of the big show!

437
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:19,903
There you go girls! Come on up!
Give 'em some towels!

438
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:24,783
Wow! Good work!

439
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:25,826
waste time for canoe.

440
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:28,745
I must've gotten my knots mixed up!

441
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:31,290
So you caught zero fish and you lose our only boat.

442
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,500
This sea is so full of accomplishment!

443
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,377
Jake is gonna kill us.

444
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:36,753
Somebody will see us.

445
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:39,047
Look! There's some boats just right over there!

446
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:41,842
Don't waste your time, they'll never see us.

447
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:42,885
They're way too far.

448
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,763
Hello!

449
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:54,646
Hello!

450
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:12,956
We need some help!

451
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:14,291
Hey!

452
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,834
We're over here!

453
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:18,545
Somebody please help us!

454
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:24,361
Look at the size of that!

455
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:26,989
What is it? A... a cavern system?

456
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:29,199
Looks to me like a subterranean lake.

457
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,534
Probably bigger then the one above.

458
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:34,371
You see that gap right there?
- Yeah?

459
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:35,622
Quake open that one up.

460
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:38,292
Now it's a
connecting passage.

461
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,251
A lake under a lake.

462
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:40,294
That's right.

463
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,295
Sorry! It's still your jurisdiction.

464
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:44,381
It's part of an old volcanic ridge all over this area.

465
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,216
That's the beauty of it.

466
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:48,510
We're gonna be the first ones to explore it.

467
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:50,262
You got it.

468
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,806
I don't know why you get excited over that crap.

469
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:55,267
All I ever see is rocks and sand.

470
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:18,540
You should probably warn them
that it's not pretty down there.

471
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:21,251
Tourists treat this lake like it's a gabbage can.

472
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,296
How you guys doing?

473
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:26,590
Sheriff said that  it's a regular treasure trove down there.

474
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:28,091
So...!

475
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:30,260
I got debs on these spent bubbles,

476
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,804
bad body sprays and back issues of drugs.

477
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,098
I got debs on home appliances.

478
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,476
I got debs on missing college girls.

479
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,024
Oh my god.

480
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,236
This is the longest one I've ever seen.

481
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:50,239
Can you keep your mind on the task at hand.

482
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:59,331
It's at least 100 feet Novak!

483
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:07,005
Almost full visibility.

484
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:08,590
Descending fissure!

485
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,510
My PO2 is set at 1. 1.3.

486
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:14,304
You should see this.

487
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,723
It's unbelievable.

488
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:19,935
Novak, do you copy?

489
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:20,978
Yeah! Pretty good.

490
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:30,320
Okay guys you are about 90 feet to the
entrance of the connecting passage.

491
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:36,535
Looks like single file time!

492
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:37,619
I'll go first.

493
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,913
No! I should do the prelim scout.

494
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:41,999
Your fat ass will get us stuck.

495
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:43,876
Baby! I'm like an eel.

496
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:44,668
I'm electric eel.

497
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,837
I get into such tight spaces.

498
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:47,880
It's shocking.

499
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:50,090
Huh! That's weird?

500
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:53,302
Here they are... but they're spiltting up.

501
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,265
Guys?

502
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:02,311
Everything alright? I'm losing you a little bit here.

503
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:17,201
I'm heading a serious drop in temperature here.

504
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:18,660
It's at least 30 degrees colder.

505
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:21,663
You're probably at the mountain near the water lake.

506
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:25,584
Do you have any visual?

507
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:30,047
I'm entering the cave.

508
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,738
Jesus!

509
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,824
This thing seems endless.

510
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:11,588
You gotta see this.

511
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:12,965
This is incredible.

512
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:15,944
Sam! What are you seeing down there?

513
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,406
Something bit me!

514
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:23,952
Oh yeah, right! I thought you always love that kinda stuff.

515
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:37,758
Sam! Sam!

516
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,092
Sam! Answer me!

517
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:40,135
SAM!

518
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:41,178
Sam!

519
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,359
Something's happening.

520
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:57,236
What? You mean aftershock?
- I don't know...

521
00:37:57,236 --> 00:37:58,278
Give me my flippers.

522
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:47,953
OH MY GOD!

523
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:17,274
Your body is a temple.

524
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:20,235
And now it is time to give thanks to the gods.

525
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:23,780
Andrew, roll camera!

526
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:24,573
Kelly, you're up! C'mon!

527
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,241
Me! No! no, no...

528
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:29,036
No, thanks. I think very had to drink too much.

529
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:30,996
Please! You don't want to worship this beautiful altar?!
- C'mon...

530
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:33,248
I know you're partial to the champagne,

531
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:35,667
but believe us you can trust Crystal right?

532
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:37,836
Hey! C'mon Derrick, she... she said no.

533
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:38,879
No...

534
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:40,380
She said no thanks...

535
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,256
There's a difference...

536
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:44,426
She understands gratitude is the right attitude.

537
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,094
Kelly!

538
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:46,929
Trust us!

539
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:49,264
It... It's never cheating if it's with another chick!

540
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,015
Yeah! C'mon try it!
- C'mon.

541
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:51,475
Sure!

542
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:52,518
Have fun!

543
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:55,938
Yeah! Jake! You're not gonna take away the fun now?

544
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:59,733
Like I said... she's not my girlfriend.

545
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:03,237
Fine! I'll do it.

546
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:04,571
Okay!
- Yeah!

547
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:05,489
Okay!

548
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:06,532
Here we go!

549
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:07,991
First, you lick this salt.

550
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:09,034
Here we go!
- Okay!

551
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:10,285
C'mon over here!

552
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:13,163
Then you suck up the tequila.

553
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,916
Here we go! Sorry about that
Crystal!

554
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:16,959
Here's your vitamin C!

555
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,919
Gonna get your lime!

556
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:20,963
Kelly! You don't have to do this.

557
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:23,340
I really don't think I need any
of your babysitting here. Jake!

558
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:25,884
Rachel!

559
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:30,639
Okay.

560
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:31,932
Okay.

561
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:43,235
Yeah!...

562
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:57,291
Alright! alright...

563
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:58,542
Let's switch places!

564
00:40:58,542 --> 00:40:59,585
Good job Kelly!

565
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:00,043
Jake you're up!

566
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:01,378
Derrick excuse me! Up a little bit.

567
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,297
How bout we try Jake and Kelly?

568
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:04,047
What?
- What?

569
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,048
No! I don't think she.
- No! I don't think...

570
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,091
Oh! C'mon Derrick.

571
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:07,801
C'mon guys, we'll shooting...

572
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:09,720
porno not a drama. Let's make a decision.

573
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,929
C'mon.

574
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:14,266
Fuck it! Sandrat...
Let's roll, c'mon!

575
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:16,059
There you go! Thank you Crystal!

576
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,270
C'mon Kelly. Come on up here.

577
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:20,439
Come on by the bed!

578
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:21,481
There we go!

579
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:24,485
Let's get you some salt!

580
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,822
A little bit of tequila!

581
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:29,990
Okay!

582
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,033
Yeah!

583
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:32,993
And... You're live!

584
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:33,744
Okay! okay!

585
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:34,578
Roll, roll, roll...

586
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:35,621
Roll!

587
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:55,390
Sandrat! Sandrat!...

588
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:08,403
Mr. Goodman?

589
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:10,447
Mr. Goodman!

590
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:13,784
I'm coming!

591
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:16,620
I'm coming, hold your horses!

592
00:42:18,497 --> 00:42:20,582
The store is closed!

593
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:31,718
I want to know what the hell
this thing is doing in my lake!

594
00:42:33,637 --> 00:42:35,305
Where did you get this?

595
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:37,099
Oh! In the middle of the lake.

596
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:39,643
Where they're two people dead!

597
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:45,399
Oh my...

598
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:46,775
Oh my! Yeah! That's right...

599
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:47,901
Oh my, oh my.

600
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,319
Excuse me!

601
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:50,195
But!

602
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:51,822
Is that a fucking Piranha?

603
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:53,699
Carl! Not the only one.

604
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:54,658
Yeah! here, here, here, look at these...

605
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:55,701
There are thousands of them.

606
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:58,328
Thousands! And they're pissed.

607
00:42:57,953 --> 00:43:00,038
You know I have heard of these happening.

608
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:02,541
It's like those alligators in New Jersey,

609
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:04,626
Someone leaves them and then they breed!

610
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:06,003
What?
- No...!

611
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:08,839
Who release this fish into the lake...

612
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:10,757
What are you talking about?

613
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:12,718
THIS!

614
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:14,011
Particular piranha,

615
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:16,138
Vanished! Off the face of the earth!

616
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,766
More than two million years ago!

617
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:23,896
Emm... Where's he going?

618
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,486
Allow me...

619
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:33,322
to introduce...

620
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:39,870
The "Pygocentrus Nattereri"

621
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:42,122
The regional Piranha!

622
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:45,709
They used to swim the entire Colorado river.

623
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:49,671
Right until the Piscusus epic .

624
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:53,717
I still don't understand how you found one.

625
00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:57,554
Alive!

626
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:00,599
We discovered a subterreanean lake through a rift,

627
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,059
caused by the quake.
- But!

628
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:06,438
How could it survived for so long,

629
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:06,939
cut out from the surface?

630
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:08,482
Cannibalism.

631
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:12,694
They must have fought each other to survive.

632
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:13,821
Look!

633
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,284
All those scars, on her scales.

634
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:22,913
Notice! The eyes.

635
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:25,499
Jesus. Like he's staring back at you.

636
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:28,502
No, no, no! Not staring...

637
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:30,712
sensing!

638
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:39,513
God! Don't do that!

639
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,933
Piranhas hunt in packs.

640
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:44,226
Not for protection!

641
00:44:44,893 --> 00:44:46,854
But overwhelming force.

642
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:50,524
They're organized, methodical...

643
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:54,444
The first bite draws blood,

644
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:56,738
more blood draws the pack!

645
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:59,491
So how are we going to stop them?

646
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:02,619
Wait. I'm sorry, you're not actually
consider going back out onto the lake?

647
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:05,205
They are killing machines but they're still fish.

648
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:06,373
You can catch them

649
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:08,584
or kill them!

650
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:11,712
If there really are thousands...

651
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:12,754
Ya?

652
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:16,633
Yesterday would have been a good time to start.

653
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:29,790
Oh Shit!

654
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:32,918
It's my little brother and sister!

655
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:34,378
Are they waving for help?

656
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:37,506
I don't know. They are supposed to be at home right now.

657
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:38,549
I'm supposed to be home right now!

658
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:40,300
Jake, jake, jake.

659
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:42,135
What are you doing?! You're gonna miss my money shot!

660
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:43,554
Okay. It's my family! Alright!

661
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:44,596
They could be in trouble!

662
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,224
You are gonna be the one in trouble,

663
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:49,685
if I don't get my flying catars right now!

664
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:52,020
What the hell's wrong with you man?

665
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:57,651
What's wrong with me?

666
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,488
Oh, God dammit! You're missing it.
You're missing it...

667
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:03,031
You're missing the shot!

668
00:47:04,908 --> 00:47:06,243
No, no, no...

669
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:09,163
Wow! You missed it! What is wrong with you?

670
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:11,790
Listen! They are stranded out there okay!

671
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:13,750
They might need my help.

672
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:15,377
Boobies, boobies...

673
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:15,919
Alright!

674
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:16,712
Listen to me.

675
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:19,548
My mom is the Sheriff.

676
00:47:34,897 --> 00:47:36,148
Alright! Let's...

677
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:37,733
swing by the island!

678
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:38,775
Throw the minerals in the boat!

679
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:40,777
It'll be great!

680
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:41,862
It'll be fun.

681
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:08,972
Take me up!

682
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:22,277
Help me!

683
00:48:22,277 --> 00:48:23,320
Take me up!

684
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:24,655
What the hell is goin on?

685
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:08,866
Weapons of mass offensive right over here!

686
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:10,242
Let's see those dance.

687
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:11,743
Alright girls!

688
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:14,037
Shake those booties!

689
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:15,080
Shake those Hoolas!

690
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:17,249
Willy Wonka and those chocolate factory!

691
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:40,606
Yes, I need the National Guard...

692
00:49:41,106 --> 00:49:41,899
I need the Coast Guard.

693
00:49:41,899 --> 00:49:44,485
I need all the forces in your power to deploy!

694
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:48,197
Everybody back to the beach!

695
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:50,991
Move back to the dock! Everybody!

696
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:52,034
Move back!

697
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:12,930
Don't talk about Satan. Just take your boat back.

698
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,140
No more talk about Satan.
Please!

699
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:18,727
Fuck them!

700
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:24,107
What the fuck?

701
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:36,328
This is the Lake Victoria sheriff's department.

702
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:40,749
The Sheriff has declared an emergency.

703
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:42,876
Don't worry, we got beer over here!

704
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:45,629
Geronimo!

705
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:48,757
Hi! Get on out over there.

706
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:51,510
I need you out of the water now!

707
00:50:51,844 --> 00:50:53,053
Yeah!

708
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:54,638
Hit it DJ Chocolate Thunder!

709
00:51:27,963 --> 00:51:30,090
Is that Jake? Why is he here?

710
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:30,966
I don't know.

711
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:32,926
We're so busted.
- No!

712
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:33,677
He is.

713
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,470
I didn't even catch any fish!

714
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:36,513
Slow down.

715
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:39,516
Slow down!
Okay! I know what I'm doing... alright!

716
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:41,518
Careful! It's not that deep!

717
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:44,354
We're busted.

718
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:50,861
Okay Jake! I'm not taking the fall for this.

719
00:51:50,861 --> 00:51:51,904
It was all Zane's idea.

720
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:55,157
I paid you $60 bucks to stay home.

721
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:56,074
What do you mean!

722
00:51:56,074 --> 00:51:57,367
How bout 40 we're call it even.

723
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:59,536
How bout you get on this boat and we go home!

724
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:00,704
End of story!

725
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:04,958
Just get on the boat!

726
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:06,793
Woah, woah, woah!
- We should've been at Canyon Beach

727
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:09,254
an hour ago for the mother fucking main event!

728
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:11,632
C'mon!
- Alright! Go ahead! Speedo!

729
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:13,342
Be careful getting outta here!

730
00:52:13,342 --> 00:52:15,802
the rocks sometimes circulate the engine!

731
00:52:24,102 --> 00:52:25,604
I want you to rest somehow, okay!

732
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:26,939
And keep Zane and Laura with you

733
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:28,816
I don't want them anywhere near Derrick.

734
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:31,777
Wow! The water is just so clear.

735
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:38,200
What kind of fish was that?

736
00:52:38,575 --> 00:52:39,660
I don't know.

737
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:41,995
I'm gonna make them take us
home right now okay.

738
00:52:44,832 --> 00:52:45,833
What is that?

739
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:47,334
What happened?

740
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:50,712
Are you guys okay?

741
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:53,257
I think we hit something.

742
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:03,308
Andrew! what hell's going on now?

743
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:06,186
I don't know! We're stuck on something!

744
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:08,147
Well! Fix it god dammit! Fix it!

745
00:53:08,814 --> 00:53:09,731
There are rocks everywhere!

746
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:11,191
Yeah! There're rocks down here!

747
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:13,110
What happened?

748
00:53:13,235 --> 00:53:15,487
God! I think something caught on the prop (rotors).

749
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,240
Okay, stay put!

750
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:19,575
Alright.

751
00:53:19,783 --> 00:53:21,285
Crystal, get the sandrat up here.

752
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,371
I said get the fucking sandrat up here!

753
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:25,622
What's wrong with you!
- Hey!

754
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:28,625
Why didn't you go get him yourself?

755
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:39,344
I just got here thinking...

756
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:42,139
how this whole fucked up day has been your fault.

757
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:44,308
Wanna help me with the new bitch?

758
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:47,144
Don't do a fucking thing I tell you...

759
00:53:47,144 --> 00:53:49,021
you take us way the fuck off course!

760
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:51,148
I... I...

761
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:52,357
I... get it.

762
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:53,817
You're, you're new at this.

763
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:56,320
I'm, I'm cool with that man. Really!

764
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,362
I am... but, but...

765
00:53:57,613 --> 00:53:58,614
But what you do to me...

766
00:53:59,406 --> 00:54:01,366
What this is...

767
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:03,410
Aarg! There is a word for it ...

768
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,120
It's a... it's a...

769
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:05,954
It's a boat word...

770
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:07,372
What is it? Ah...

771
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:09,583
Mutiny.

772
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:10,626
Is that what it is ?

773
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:12,669
Is this a Mutiny?

774
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,463
Relax Derrick. Okay.

775
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:15,797
I'm just...

776
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:16,840
I'm just going a bit wild.

777
00:54:24,473 --> 00:54:25,807
If anyone should down there helping,

778
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:27,309

779
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:30,646
Let me do that.

780
00:54:30,646 --> 00:54:31,563
Let me do that!

781
00:54:31,563 --> 00:54:32,356

00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:15,537
Where are you going?

795
00:58:16,288 --> 00:58:17,664
Throw me the gun!

796
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:18,707
It's fully loaded!

797
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:32,804

01:08:17,222 --> 01:08:18,348
This is Sheriff Forester.

871
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:20,058
Mom?
- Jake!

872
01:08:21,185 --> 01:08:22,728
I'm sorry, I screwed up. We're on the lake.

873
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:23,395
What?

874
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:25,606
Where's Lauren and Zane?

875
01:08:25,814 --> 01:08:27,065
They're with me on the boat.

876
01:08:27,608 --> 01:08:28,484
Oh my god! Jake.

877
01:08:29,193 --> 01:08:31,028
Whatever you do, do not go into the water!

878
01:08:31,653 --> 01:08:33,906
You do not understand, Mom! Our boat is sinking!

879
01:08:35,032 --> 01:08:36,074
What?...

880
01:08:38,785 --> 01:08:40,245
Where are you?

881
01:08:42,122 --> 01:08:43,040

That's mom.

885
01:09:26,124 --> 01:09:27,417

01:09:27,626 --> 01:09:28,669
Hey!

887
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:31,088
Stuck in rocks!
- Yeah!

888
01:09:32,214 --> 01:09:34,383
How're gonna get the boat close?
- I don't know.

889
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:36,301
Use the rope.

890
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:37,344
Here! They gonna reach!

891
01:09:37,636 --> 01:09:38,679

892
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:41,140
Jake! I'm gonna throw you the rope!

893
01:09:41,306 --> 01:09:43,308
Attach it to the highest railing!

894
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:43,851
Okay, mom!

895
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:46,979
Back it up.
- Yup.

896
01:09:49,982 --> 01:09:51,650
Back it up this way.

897
01:09:54,611 --> 01:09:56,488
Watch out for rocks!

898
01:09:57,614 --> 01:09:58,991
Yo! Watch out!

899
01:09:59,324 --> 01:10:00,284
Kay! You ready?

900
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:01,326

Okay!

Yeah!

904
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:24,308
Keep the CB on the police frequency.

905
01:10:24,308 --> 01:10:25,350
I've got my radio.

906
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:28,187
Okay! Just get there!

907
01:10:40,949 --> 01:10:41,992
Mom!

908
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:45,704
Mom, are you okay?

909
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:52,419
Is this everybody on the boat?

910
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:55,339
No! Kelly is still stuck down there in the cabin,

911
01:10:55,339 --> 01:10:56,340
we can't get her out!

912
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:57,382
We can't get her out!

913
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:58,175
Kelly?

914
01:10:58,634 --> 01:10:59,343
God!

915
01:10:59,718 --> 01:11:00,761

916
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,013
Julie? Oh my god! Hey!

917
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:04,973
You gotta help me.

918
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:06,058
Can you grab my arm?

919
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:08,519
You gonna help me get out of here.
The water's getting higher!

920
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:11,522
Can you reach the skylight?
- You better hurry! I'm fucking stuck!

921
01:11:11,563 --> 01:11:12,606
Julie!

922
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:13,899
You think I'd didn't try to pry that thing!

923
01:11:13,899 --> 01:11:14,942
God dammit!

924
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:16,610
Jake!

925
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:18,821
You guys! I'm scared!

926
01:11:19,238 --> 01:11:20,614
Please help!

927
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:23,909
Mom, we have to hurry!

928
01:11:24,201 --> 01:11:25,244
Kelly?

929
01:11:25,828 --> 01:11:26,870
Kelly!

930
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:27,704
We all gonna die?

931
01:11:27,704 --> 01:11:29,498
We're not gonna die. Okay!

932
01:11:36,755 --> 01:11:39,383
I need your help! Please!

933
01:11:39,883 --> 01:11:40,926
Jake!

934
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:43,262
The only way to get through to her is the bottom of the boat.

935
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:44,429
Get to the rope.

936
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:46,181
What are you talking about?

937
01:11:46,181 --> 01:11:47,850
We can't just leave her down there!

938
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,935
Once I get everyone across on the rope...

939
01:11:49,935 --> 01:11:51,395
I'm gonna come back for her!

940
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,856
No! I'm not gonna leave without! Mom!

941
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:54,815
Jesus Christ! Jake!

942
01:11:54,815 --> 01:11:56,108
The only way to get to her!

943
01:11:56,108 --> 01:11:58,318
Is for you to get into the water and
I'm not gonna let you do that!

944
01:11:58,318 --> 01:11:59,444
Now! C'mon and get on the boat...

945
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:01,113
Listen to me! The reason she came on this boat!

946
01:12:01,113 --> 01:12:02,489
Was because of me! Okay!

947
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:04,032
It's MY fault!

948
01:12:07,703 --> 01:12:08,912
I'm not coming without her...

949
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:11,123
Okay! This rope ain't gonna hold much longer!

950
01:12:11,123 --> 01:12:12,166
Let's go!

951
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:16,712
I'm gonna take Zane and Laura across and
I'm coming back!

952
01:12:17,337 --> 01:12:19,173
And we're gonna do it together.

953
01:12:19,631 --> 01:12:20,716
Alright.

954
01:12:21,258 --> 01:12:23,385
Alright! We're gonna keep two of them between us.

955
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:24,845
You gonna go first.

956
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:26,346
Can you do this?

957
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:29,725
Better believe it. Got my pull-ons for nothing.

958
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:35,772
You have a lot of explaining to do.

959
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:39,276
Okay, ready?

960
01:12:46,783 --> 01:12:49,119
Okay! Be careful! Don't look down! Let's go!

961
01:12:57,586 --> 01:12:59,421
Just like the playground...

962
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:01,465
Hand over hand.

963
01:13:03,926 --> 01:13:05,302
Don't look down.

964
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,138
Don't look down, alright!

965
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:11,558
Keep going. C'mon! You can do it.

966
01:13:11,892 --> 01:13:13,060
Hand over hand!

967
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,102
I'm scared!

968
01:13:18,315 --> 01:13:19,191
Keep going!

969
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:23,195
Careful.

970
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:25,155
Don't look down.

971
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,323
Okay!

972
01:13:26,323 --> 01:13:27,366
Oh god!

973
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:32,579
They're biting me!

974
01:13:33,997 --> 01:13:35,040
Oh god!

975
01:13:39,628 --> 01:13:42,881
Get off me!

976
01:13:55,769 --> 01:13:57,312
No! No! NO!

977
01:14:03,235 --> 01:14:04,403
God dammit!

978
01:14:11,702 --> 01:14:12,953
Listen to me! Both of you!

979
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:14,913
If you move fast!

980
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:16,123
It will NOT get you.

981
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:18,000
You have to move NOW!

982
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:19,585
Come on! MOVE IT!

983
01:14:19,585 --> 01:14:20,627
You can do it!

984
01:14:20,878 --> 01:14:21,920
GO!

985
01:14:24,256 --> 01:14:25,299
Keep moving now!

986
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:30,762
Keep going!

987
01:14:31,638 --> 01:14:32,514
Okay guys!

988
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:34,850
Good! You're here!

989
01:14:37,436 --> 01:14:39,188
Good going you guys did it!

990
01:14:45,235 --> 01:14:45,819
Dammit!

991
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:53,911
C'mon mom! Keep moving!

992
01:14:58,582 --> 01:14:59,541
You okay?

993
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,043
Cut the engine!

994
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:03,420
What are you doing?

995
01:15:04,296 --> 01:15:06,131
Jake! What are you doing?

996
01:15:09,092 --> 01:15:10,219
What are you doing?!

997
01:15:10,344 --> 01:15:11,178
Jake!

998
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:12,930
Jake! Do not do that!
- Please!

999
01:15:12,763 --> 01:15:15,057
After all they want blood right?

1000
01:15:15,057 --> 01:15:16,600
Let's give it to them.

1001
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:29,530
Wet T-shirt...

1002
01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:31,907
Wet T-shirt...

1003
01:16:53,906 --> 01:16:54,072
Jake!

1004
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:57,451
Oh my god!

1005
01:17:00,579 --> 01:17:01,288
We're getting outta of here. Okay!

1006
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:02,331
Both of us!

1007
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:04,750
Okay I'm in!

1008
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,168
I need you guys to pull us out!

1009
01:17:06,168 --> 01:17:07,503
As fast as possible.

1010
01:17:07,503 --> 01:17:08,420
Do you copy?

1011
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:10,005
Okay! We're ready when you are.

1012
01:17:16,553 --> 01:17:18,472
Jake! What are you doing?
They're gonna come back!

1013
01:17:18,263 --> 01:17:21,099
I gave them a scare okay! That's gonna
hold them off for at least...

1014
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:22,851
couple of minutes.

1015
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:29,775
Okay! I need you to tie these together okay!
- Why?

1016
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:30,984
Just do it!

1017
01:17:31,443 --> 01:17:32,945
Jake! Where are you going?!

1018
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:36,990
Jake!

1019
01:17:57,886 --> 01:17:59,221
I need to you to hold your breath...

1020
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:02,474
And we're gonna swim out
of the bottom of the boat. Okay!

1021
01:18:02,891 --> 01:18:04,101
And I need you to hold on tight!

1022
01:18:04,101 --> 01:18:05,561
Can you hold on TIGHT to me?

1023
01:18:08,647 --> 01:18:09,690
Alright...

1024
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:13,485
Do you clear! Pull us out in 10 seconds! Okay?

1025
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:14,528
Do you guys copy?!

1026
01:18:14,528 --> 01:18:16,071
Copy that! Ten seconds on your signal.

1027
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:17,447
Get the kids down.

1028
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:31,086
10.

1029
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:49,771
6 ... 5 ... 4 ...

1030
01:18:50,731 --> 01:18:53,942
... 3 ... 2 ... 1

1031
01:19:03,494 --> 01:19:04,786
Eh...! What's wrong?

1032
01:19:05,746 --> 01:19:06,788
C'mon!

1033
01:19:06,788 --> 01:19:07,831
Stuck!

1034
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:10,042
Rud clear!

1035
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:11,210
God dammit!

1036
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:12,252
Is it in gear?

1037
01:19:12,211 --> 01:19:12,753
No!

1038
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:14,296
C'mon!

1039
01:19:14,713 --> 01:19:16,548
C'mon! You fucking thing!

1040
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:28,310
It's gotta work! It's gotta work!

1041
01:19:56,088 --> 01:19:57,214
Oh my god!

1042
01:19:57,965 --> 01:19:59,299
Holy shit!

1043
01:20:19,069 --> 01:20:19,903
You alright?!

1044
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:24,032
Come!

1045
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:25,075
C'mon!

1046
01:20:27,327 --> 01:20:28,370
C'mon!

1047
01:20:30,998 --> 01:20:33,083
C'mon! You're alright! You're alright!

1048
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:34,543
Breathe! You're okay!

1049
01:20:35,127 --> 01:20:36,170
You're okay!

1050
01:20:37,421 --> 01:20:38,463
You're okay!

1051
01:20:38,755 --> 01:20:39,798
You're okay!

1052
01:20:39,923 --> 01:20:40,632
Oh my god!

1053
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:42,009
Glad to have you on board!

1054
01:20:42,009 --> 01:20:43,051
Jesus Christ!

1055
01:20:44,803 --> 01:20:45,637
Holy shit!

1056
01:20:50,142 --> 01:20:51,935
Look! Mom! Over here!

1057
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:54,354
They died!

1058
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,065
They're all dead!

1059
01:21:11,788 --> 01:21:13,040
You did it Jake!

1060
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:14,541
I did!

1061
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:15,667
It worked!

1062
01:21:15,709 --> 01:21:19,004
Hey! I thought dynamite fishing was
illegal in these parts sheriff?

1063
01:21:20,297 --> 01:21:22,674
Sheriff?

1064
01:21:21,215 --> 01:21:22,257
Sheriff?

1065
01:21:23,342 --> 01:21:24,635
Yeah! This is Julie!

1066
01:21:26,345 --> 01:21:27,638
Julie... this is Carl.

1067
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:30,057
We have a major problem.

1068
01:21:30,057 --> 01:21:32,851
Well! I am looking out at a school of dead piranhas.

1069
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:35,270
Not all of them but I think it's a good start.

1070
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,563
You don't understand.

1071
01:21:37,648 --> 01:21:39,900
The specimen you left with me...

1072
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,862
has no mature reproductive organs.

1073
01:21:45,656 --> 01:21:46,114
What?

1074
01:21:46,114 --> 01:21:48,534
What are you talking about?

1075
01:21:49,201 --> 01:21:52,037
The piranhas that killed those divers...

1076
01:21:52,037 --> 01:21:53,580
the ones you're hurting for...

1077
01:21:54,873 --> 01:21:56,834
They are not fully developed.

1078
01:21:57,209 --> 01:21:59,211
They're the babies!

1079
01:22:02,381 --> 01:22:03,841
Babies?

1080
01:22:05,384 --> 01:22:06,426
huh...

1081
01:22:07,469 --> 01:22:08,262
So?

1082
01:22:08,262 --> 01:22:11,515
Where are the parents?
