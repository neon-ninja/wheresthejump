1
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:33,551
Yeah, that's, yeah, that's really good.

2
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,845
And you... you like being a hockey coach?

3
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,847
Yes.

4
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,975
The girls love to play,
and if they're happy, I'm happy.

5
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,852
Mm.

6
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,564
Can be tricky, though.
I pity the boys trying to date them.

7
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,191
But on the pitch they're actually great.

8
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:51,861
Getting out all their frustrations...

9
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,363
I suppose.

10
00:01:54,488 --> 00:01:57,074
Something like that.

11
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,206
I can't.

12
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:06,041
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,836
It's so good to see you.

14
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,380
I'm gonna go.

15
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,295
Ah!

16
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,589
I reject the good. I reject the light.

17
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:38,759
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

18
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:41,303
Beneath this magic tree
given to the first witches

19
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:46,058
by the Prince of the Underworld...
we will bleed this body of its life.

20
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:56,277
We reach out to his realm
with this special gift.

21
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:00,448
Enchant this fruit
and grant us your familiars.

22
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,117
They will be our bond
with the world beneath.

23
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:09,665
Give us that power.

24
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,501
Give us your favor.

25
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,090
Death is the beginning of everything.

26
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,809
Death is the beginning.

27
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,187
Death is the beginning.

28
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:59,673
Orchard got its name because
it's located in a fruit farming area.

29
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,301
The town is also founded by a Utopian cult

30
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:04,845
which was later linked to witchcraft.

31
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,848
The most famous witch was Eleanor Young.

32
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:10,142
She was said to have been given
an enchanted Cherry Tree

33
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:11,769
as a gift from the underworld.

34
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,272
The roots of the tree were nourished
by the blood of human sacrifice

35
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:18,609
which, in turn gave her
the power to use its magic.

36
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:22,446
She also used its wood and fruit
to perform her spells and glamours.

37
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:26,534
The story goes that she was arrested
and convicted of witchcraft but...

38
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,869
when they tried to burn her
at the stake the fire wouldn't light.

39
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:31,372
- Ooh, nice block.
- All in a day's work.

40
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,082
Eventually she was banished from the town.

41
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,542
Hold it, Brian.

42
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,044
Is there something going on?

43
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,088
I asked a question.

44
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,758
Okay, carry on, Brian.

45
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:44,468
- He's not bad, is he?
- Thank you, Miss.

46
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:45,886
Shame about the hair, though.

47
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:49,098
Eleanor Young's legend features
strongly in local folklore but

48
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:53,561
there are, in fact, no records that exist
to prove she ever lived and, well,

49
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,938
no one's ever found the magic tree.

50
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:58,065
But many people in the 16th century

51
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,402
were accused of witchcraft
and communing with evil spirits.

52
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,904
They were often burned at the stake
with little proof of guilt.

53
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:06,532
Communing? Isn't that like an orgy?

54
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,576
You know, I think that
does mean 'orgy', yeah.

55
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,827
People, please.

56
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,830
Can we just concentrate on folklore.

57
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,039
Fuck-lore.

58
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,167
Faith. Amy.

59
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,086
I'll see you both after class.

60
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:39,523
Okay, girls, line up!

61
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:46,989
My name is Sissy Young
and I'm your new coach.

62
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:50,159
Now I know the loss of Miss Hunt last year

63
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:55,122
must have been very difficult for all of
you and things will never be the same.

64
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:58,459
But I know that she wouldn't
want you to live in past.

65
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,670
She would want you to train hard

66
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,964
and play to the best of your abilities.

67
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,134
So, let's honor her memory

68
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,595
and play every game this year to win.

69
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,307
I have two places available on
the senior team for the match on Friday.

70
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,810
Let's see you play.

71
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:18,729
- Ah.
- Sorry.

72
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:20,564
Hey, comedians, cut it out.

73
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,152
- What's your name?
- Faith Maguire.

74
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:26,487
Okay.

75
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,155
Let's go!

76
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,866
That's not where your
sani-pad goes, Faith.

77
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,058
Can I have your attention, please?

78
00:07:56,183 --> 00:08:00,187
I've made my decision for the senior
team line-up for the game on Friday.

79
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:05,025
Caroline St John and Jennifer Engels,
you will captain the team as usual.

80
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:07,695
What a shame, the fifteen
year old virgin didn't make it.

81
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,071
Shut up, Caroline.

82
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:10,865
I'm not finished, ladies.

83
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,868
I like to reward talent,
so I'm pleased to announce

84
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:18,330
the first place on the subs
bench will go to Faith Maguire.

85
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,925
You know Brian has a huge crush on you.

86
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,470
Brian Kelly?

87
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,555
He's cute.

88
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,307
Well, you go out with him then.

89
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,142
That's my plan.

90
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,810
Are you gonna help me or what?

91
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,353
Because I'm a mechanic now?

92
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,856
Oh, fucking whatever.
Just come and help me.

93
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,066
Lift that up.

94
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,278
Well done, Faith.

95
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,740
Best hockey player to never get a match.

96
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,910
Oh, just piss off, will you?

97
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,746
Congratulations on not making the team.

98
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,040
Virgins and retards tend not to fit in.

99
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,793
- Hey, no, no, no.
- Alright, girls, that's enough.

100
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,295
Save it for the hockey field.

101
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,297
Shake hands.

102
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:16,514
Jennifer, Caroline, I'm sure
you've got somewhere to be.

103
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,975
Come on, let's go.

104
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,479
We have another senior match on Friday.

105
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,064
Will you play?

106
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,316
Love to.

107
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,235
Come on.

108
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,089
- Hey.
- Hey, Faith.

109
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,636
- Where's dad?
- He's just...

110
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:06,897
Dad?

111
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,783
Have you taken your meds
since this morning?

112
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,457
Thank you.

113
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,834
I'm fine.

114
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,587
I'm fine, come on.

115
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,797
Well we've got a hearse
waiting outside, if you need it.

116
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,340
Very funny, smartass.

117
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,801
Shouldn't you be learning stuff
or something?

118
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,512
- I have news.
- Yeah?

119
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:41,307
Got put on the senior hockey team today.

120
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,976
That's amazing.

121
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,105
No fags.

122
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,400
Come on, Dad, at least try and look
after yourself, I'm worried about you.

123
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:55,070
Don't be, don't think about it.
Think about your birthday.

124
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,740
Let's have a party.

125
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,826
- Bye.
- See you.

126
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,663
She's always going on at me.

127
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,631
Hey, Faith.

128
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:15,424
Faith!

129
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,635
Hey.

130
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,806
Hey, Brian. What's up?

131
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,642
- I was looking for you after class.
- You were?

132
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,062
Yeah, um, I was just wondering
like, if you've got time or whatever,

133
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,523
d'you wanna go see a film
or get a pizza or something?

134
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:34,193
I just don't think Amy
would be very happy with that.

135
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,694
So?

136
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,114
She's not... my girlfriend.

137
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:42,034
Yeah, but she's my friend
and she likes you so, sorry.

138
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,786
Cool, yeah.

139
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,829
Sorry.

140
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,038
No.

141
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,790
That's my dad.

142
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,208
That's our house.

143
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,668
Okay, cool.

144
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,794
I am very flattered.

145
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,506
Well, look, if you change your mind
I'll be standing right here.

146
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,925
Dad?

147
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,554
- You alright?
- Dad, are you okay?

148
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,597
Dad, can you hear me?

149
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,104
Thanks, Brian.

150
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,647
Alright.

151
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,567
See you.

152
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,537
He is going to need a lot of care
over the coming days.

153
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:30,499
Yeah, yeah, I know.

154
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,588
Took a bit of a dive there, didn't I?

155
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,465
Hey, Dad.

156
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,799
How are you feeling?

157
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,469
Yeah, fine.

158
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,263
Doctor Slater.

159
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,765
Faith called me.

160
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,602
You're going to need to take
some rest for the next few days.

161
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,229
I'll see you soon.

162
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,709
- Faith.
- Mm.

163
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,045
They're calling me.

164
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,379
What?

165
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,924
I have to go.

166
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,595
Dad?

167
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,390
Dad?

168
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,493
Dad?

169
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,511
Dad?

170
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,648
Save me.

171
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,157
Remember you have a doctor's
appointment this morning.

172
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,367
- I know.
- You are going?

173
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,745
- Yeah.
- Good.

174
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,165
- Wish me luck for my big match.
- Break a leg.

175
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,167
Preferably not one of yours.

176
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,252
Bye.

177
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,388
This leukemia therapy
was a long shot, Sean.

178
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,557
It was working.

179
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:37,394
The balance between the red
and white cells had been restored.

180
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,563
But not any more.

181
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,109
I'm sorry.

182
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,322
How long?

183
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,616
Three months.

184
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,661
Probably less.

185
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,708
I can arrange counseling.

186
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,504
Sean.

187
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,462
- Good luck, Faith.
- Good luck, Faith.

188
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:48,382
Jennifer. Faith! Come here.

189
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,221
You're on the same team today, okay?

190
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,140
Alright, let's go.

191
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,309
Kill, kill, kill...

192
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:11,322
Orchard, Orchard, Orchard...

193
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,846
Faith?

194
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,891
- Dad?
- Hey.

195
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,102
Dad, why are you here?

196
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,980
I just thought I'd come and see you play.
I am the boss, I can do that, you know.

197
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,565
What did Doctor Slater say?

198
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,609
You know, the usual stuff.

199
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,569
Faith.

200
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,780
Look, let's talk after. Okay?

201
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,199
- It's fine.
- Come on, Faith.

202
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,035
Go on, you're holding the game up.

203
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,288
Talk to you after. Okay?

204
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,969
Ah.

205
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,929
Hey, Ref, come on!

206
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,306
Faith?

207
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,743
What the fuck, Faith?

208
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,536
Claire, it's me.

209
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,954
Is everything okay there?

210
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,081
Yeah, I'm on my way.

211
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:28,292
I've just got a bit of a thing with Faith.

212
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,878
I'll see you soon.

213
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,052
Sorry.

214
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,599
What did she say?

215
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,023
Okay.

216
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,819
- We're gonna fight it all the way.
- Mm.

217
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,301
Faith.

218
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,512
Coach?

219
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,806
Are you okay?

220
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:28,269
It's, er, my dad.

221
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,689
I thought he was better.

222
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,318
I'd like to show you something.

223
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,738
It might help.

224
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,700
Come.

225
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,504
This is quite a house.

226
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,672
Hmm.

227
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,384
It's been in the family a long time.

228
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,984
This way.

229
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,204
My great aunt.

230
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,873
We were very close.

231
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,761
Do you believe in magic, Faith?

232
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,304
I don't know.

233
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,681
That's a very strange question.

234
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,519
It's a very strange world.

235
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,897
Not all of it benign.

236
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,776
Beautiful in its own way.

237
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,113
I can't believe this is under your house.

238
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,532
Hmm, I knew you'd like it.

239
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,534
I don't like it.

240
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,119
What's it for?

241
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,122
It's a haven for people like me.

242
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,332
At its heart is a Chamber

243
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,127
where we're safe to practice our craft.

244
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:21,257
Nothing can enter from heaven
or hell unless we allow it.

245
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:25,469
This place is a gift from
the Lord of the Underworld.

246
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:32,810
Here we serve him
and we celebrate his glorious reign.

247
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,770
And in return

248
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,149
he rewards us with his dark powers.

249
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:41,277
But he demands complete devotion,

250
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,196
and if you defy that...

251
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:48,325
he draws down his terrible rage.

252
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,995
We're nearly here.

253
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:20,649
There are forces in nature
that people rarely see.

254
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:24,069
Some call it magic.

255
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:33,412
It is sacred and righteous.

256
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,667
Fuck.

257
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,883
These are nature's familiars.

258
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,762
They help us to reach
from this realm to the other

259
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:54,016
and use the power that lies there.

260
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,736
Watch.

261
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,426
You see?

262
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:32,596
Death is the beginning of everything.

263
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,854
You can cure him?

264
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,941
That's why I showed you.

265
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,651
Will you?

266
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,779
Power comes from desire.

267
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:15,658
How strong is your desire
to save your father?

268
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,536
He's all I have.

269
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,081
Will you help me?

270
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:25,209
I'd like something in return.

271
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,671
I want you to have a baby for me.

272
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,007
What?

273
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:38,013
I'm fifteen. I...

274
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,600
Well, think about it.

275
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,062
What if I have this baby?

276
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,773
I'll cure your father.

277
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,859
And the baby? What will happen to it?

278
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,779
It'll be mine.

279
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,658
And my dad, he'll be cured?

280
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,160
Everything is connected.

281
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,622
Everything has to be tallied and paid for.

282
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:31,419
If you give, you will be given to.

283
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:35,798
Your father's going to die, and if you
want to change the course of nature...

284
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:39,260
you have to honor that cycle.

285
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,097
It's your choice.

286
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,934
I have no choice.

287
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,569
I've never done it.

288
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:02,450
Who would I do it with?

289
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:06,829
Oh, come on,
there's nice young men everywhere.

290
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:10,249
You're young and beautiful.

291
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,628
What's wrong with that?

292
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,716
Your birthday's coming.

293
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,845
That's the time.

294
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,777
- Hi.
- Happy birthday.

295
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:40,321
- Thank you.
- It's good to see you.

296
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:41,530
- Jeremy.
- Happy birthday, Faith.

297
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,407
- Thank you.
- Many happy returns.

298
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:44,200
- How are you?
- Good.

299
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:45,409
- How are you?
- Very well.

300
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,203
- I'll see you in there, okay?
- Okay, darling, see you in there.

301
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,955
- Jeremy, how are you?
- Hello, how are you?

302
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,919
Hi, sweetheart. Happy birthday.

303
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,879
Thank you.

304
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,048
Champagne?

305
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:02,093
Er, Sicilian lemonade. Nice try.

306
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:04,428
There you go.

307
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,847
Oh, thank you.

308
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,265
Hello.

309
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,102
Jennifer mentioned it was your birthday.

310
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:12,436
I wanted to give you this.

311
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,188
Oh.

312
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,606
Thanks.

313
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,192
Save them for later.

314
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,786
- I'm Sissy, by the way.
- Sean. Nice to meet you properly.

315
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,913
- Small world.
- Yes, it is.

316
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:31,872
Ah, this is Jeremy.

317
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,374
- Jeremy, hello.
- Sissy, nice to meet you.

318
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,292
Excuse me.

319
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:37,920
- So are you having fun?
- Mm. Yep.

320
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:41,340
You are a terrible liar. Terrible.

321
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,509
Well, you'll be glad to know
this isn't your real party.

322
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:46,846
- Really?
- Really. Amy's gonna take it from here.

323
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:47,972
- And Brian.
- And Brian.

324
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,015
It's all been arranged.
Go out and have a good night.

325
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,350
- Love you.
- And I'll see you later.

326
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,143
- I love you.
- Mm, yes.

327
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,477
- Alright, happy birthday, sweetheart.
- Bye.

328
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:54,353
- See you.
- Alright, bye.

329
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,605
- Thank you.
- Take care.

330
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,193
Oh, cheeky.

331
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,203
Where are we going?

332
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:14,373
Okay, watch your step, watch your step.
Alright, alright, just through here.

333
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,958
Two seconds.

334
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,169
Okay. Are you ready?

335
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,170
- Okay, are you ready?
- Yes, yes, yes.

336
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:21,714
- Are you ready? Are you sure?
- Yes.

337
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,634
Happy birthday!

338
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,560
My humble abode.

339
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,478
Hey.

340
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:20,147
Hi.

341
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,817
Are you alright?

342
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:25,319
Yeah.

343
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,198
It's nice out here, isn't it?

344
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:33,953
Sorry, I'm way too good at
ruining special moments.

345
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:36,247
Unless, you know, you
want me to keep talking.

346
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:39,375
I can also do that
'cause I got plenty to say.

347
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,794
If that works for you,
I don't know, maybe.

348
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,463
Maybe not.

349
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,146
Hi, Brian.

350
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:01,772
Having a good time?

351
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,483
Uh...

352
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:07,653
You bitch.

353
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,614
Amy.

354
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:14,702
Sorry, I...

355
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:17,413
It's fine.

356
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,417
Walk me home?

357
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,127
Yeah.

358
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,921
Shh.

359
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:35,306
Quietly.

360
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:06,879
It's nice.

361
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:19,637
Faith.

362
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:22,139
Oh, God, Mrs. Fincher.

363
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:24,892
Sissy is here.

364
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:06,142
I reject the good.

365
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:09,061
I reject the light.

366
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:13,858
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

367
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,652
Come amongst us now.

368
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:19,989
Take our brother's hand.

369
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:25,578
Though today he falls,
tomorrow he will stand.

370
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,138
- Faith!
- Dad.

371
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:46,474
No, no, no!

372
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,362
I reject the good. I reject the light.

373
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:25,823
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

374
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,492
I reject the good. I reject the light.

375
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:31,245
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

376
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,956
I reject the good. I reject the light.

377
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:36,709
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

378
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:39,253
I reject the good. I reject the light.

379
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:42,006
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

380
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:44,592
I reject the good. I reject the light.

381
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:47,261
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

382
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:49,889
I reject the good. I reject the light.

383
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:53,893
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

384
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:34,809
- Dad.
- Hey.

385
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:36,560
That's a lot of food.

386
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:37,853
Yeah.

387
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:40,856
Feel a bit hung-over after the party.

388
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:43,567
It's good I've got an appetite, though.

389
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,277
You have fun?

390
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:48,447
Yeah, it was great.

391
00:41:51,302 --> 00:41:53,304
Faith.

392
00:41:53,429 --> 00:41:55,139
You're sick.

393
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:56,932
Yeah.

394
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,851
That's good.

395
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:00,936
Take this, pee on it.

396
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:03,773
Tell me what it says.

397
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:19,622
Sean.

398
00:42:19,747 --> 00:42:21,415
What d'you think you're doing?

399
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,835
Changing a bulb. What's it look like?

400
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:29,131
Sean?

401
00:42:31,509 --> 00:42:34,261
Sean!

402
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:40,142
You're both part of this.

403
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,478
That's fucked up.

404
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:44,271
If you say so.

405
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:47,316
Well, you can give her this.
Tell her I'm pregnant.

406
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:49,902
You should be happy, your dad is cured.

407
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:52,363
Listen.

408
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:55,574
How can I be pregnant so soon?

409
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,326
I know, right?

410
00:42:57,451 --> 00:43:00,538
Where's the fun in that?

411
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:12,466
Amy.

412
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:15,344
Amy. Amy, please, come on.

413
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:17,847
I suppose you're looking for Brian?

414
00:43:17,972 --> 00:43:23,686
I haven't seen him, so
you should go fuck yourself.

415
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:31,652
Hey, Claire. What's up?

416
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,071
What?

417
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,543
You tricked me.

418
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:49,962
My dad is still sick.
He was taken to hospital today.

419
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:53,382
- Come in, Faith.
- I'm pregnant!

420
00:43:55,384 --> 00:43:58,345
Your father is cured, I promise you.

421
00:43:58,471 --> 00:44:01,265
You have to trust me.

422
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:04,059
I need the bathroom.

423
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,063
It'll be over in six weeks.

424
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:13,778
And then another seven months of...

425
00:44:13,903 --> 00:44:17,698
No, you're going to
give birth soon, Faith.

426
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:20,451
How is that possible?

427
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:23,079
You'll see.

428
00:44:23,204 --> 00:44:24,997
What am I gonna tell my dad?

429
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:26,749
Nothing.

430
00:44:26,874 --> 00:44:28,584
For now.

431
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:32,213
Understand?

432
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:35,341
He better be cured.

433
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:49,939
- Excuse me, can I just...
- Just one second, please.

434
00:44:50,231 --> 00:44:51,774
Faith.

435
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:54,276
- Dad.
- I'm alright.

436
00:44:54,402 --> 00:44:55,986
I'm alright, really.

437
00:44:56,112 --> 00:44:58,447
It's just some sort of dizzy spell.

438
00:44:58,572 --> 00:45:02,243
I did some blood tests and it's alright.

439
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:08,499
Come on, let's get out of here.

440
00:45:53,669 --> 00:45:55,379
You alright?

441
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:57,131
Faith, listen.

442
00:45:57,256 --> 00:45:59,759
There have been reports of a
madman escaped from an asylum.

443
00:45:59,884 --> 00:46:03,846
He was last seen driving up
the Orchard Road in an old red car.

444
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:09,477
You're a dick.

445
00:46:13,397 --> 00:46:15,649
I've got news.

446
00:46:18,152 --> 00:46:20,529
The hospital just called.

447
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:24,116
My last blood test shows
no sign of leukemia.

448
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:26,702
I'm in remission.

449
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:45,805
Hey, Faith, great news about your dad.

450
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,640
Yeah, it's incredible.

451
00:46:47,765 --> 00:46:51,352
- Are you joining us?
- No rest for the wicked.

452
00:46:56,023 --> 00:46:57,733
Faith. Look who I bumped into.

453
00:46:57,858 --> 00:46:59,735
Hey, Faith.

454
00:47:00,945 --> 00:47:03,489
I'd like to make a toast.

455
00:47:04,698 --> 00:47:06,283
To life.

456
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:09,412
It never fails to surprise us.

457
00:47:09,537 --> 00:47:11,038
Cheers.

458
00:47:11,163 --> 00:47:13,290
Cheers.

459
00:47:43,195 --> 00:47:45,448
Sean.

460
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:33,329
Faith.

461
00:48:35,498 --> 00:48:38,334
Faith.

462
00:48:40,544 --> 00:48:42,046
I'm sorry.

463
00:48:42,171 --> 00:48:45,132
Sit down.

464
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,555
I don't know what to say.

465
00:48:53,516 --> 00:48:55,643
I'm... I'm just feeling so good lately.

466
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:58,604
I'm pregnant, Dad.

467
00:48:59,772 --> 00:49:02,191
Is this a joke?

468
00:49:07,279 --> 00:49:09,156
You wanna tell me about it?

469
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:10,658
There's nothing to say.

470
00:49:10,783 --> 00:49:13,160
I'm pregnant, I just
thought you should know.

471
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:15,704
You're sixteen, Faith.

472
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,748
Who's the boy?

473
00:49:17,873 --> 00:49:20,084
- Are you gonna tell him?
- No.

474
00:49:20,209 --> 00:49:23,003
I'm recovering from
a serious illness, Faith.

475
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:24,880
What if it comes back? What if I die?

476
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:27,341
- That won't happen.
- You don't know that.

477
00:49:27,466 --> 00:49:29,760
I do.

478
00:49:32,179 --> 00:49:35,433
I need to think about this.

479
00:49:59,957 --> 00:50:02,168
You shouldn't have told him.

480
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:06,338
You shouldn't have fucked him.

481
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:13,095
You know, Sean is a...
he's a wonderful man.

482
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:17,892
Be heartbreaking if he were
to get ill again, wouldn't it?

483
00:50:18,726 --> 00:50:22,438
And what d'you think would
happen to the baby then?

484
00:50:22,563 --> 00:50:24,023
I'll do what I want.

485
00:50:24,148 --> 00:50:26,025
Alright, Faith.

486
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,652
Have a look at this.

487
00:50:33,074 --> 00:50:36,410
- It's Brian.
- Mm-hmm.

488
00:50:36,535 --> 00:50:38,662
You did this?

489
00:50:38,788 --> 00:50:40,206
When you two were together

490
00:50:40,331 --> 00:50:43,501
he was possessed by another being.

491
00:50:43,626 --> 00:50:45,753
Tends to be an overwhelming experience.

492
00:50:45,878 --> 00:50:47,922
The thing is he's gone. Sean was dead.

493
00:50:48,047 --> 00:50:50,591
For him to be alive again someone else
had to die. It's the way it works.

494
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:54,095
- You said if I had a baby...
- I did, didn't I?

495
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:59,100
But before you get too upset about it,
remember this is what you wanted.

496
00:50:59,225 --> 00:51:03,896
Let's stick to the plan
from now on, shall we?

497
00:51:11,612 --> 00:51:13,989
Hey, Faith. Is everything okay?

498
00:51:14,115 --> 00:51:15,866
Well, no, not exactly.

499
00:51:15,991 --> 00:51:17,535
Can I help?

500
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,371
Um, could you come over tonight?

501
00:51:20,496 --> 00:51:22,915
I need to talk to you about something.

502
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,751
Okay, great. Thanks.

503
00:51:32,383 --> 00:51:33,801
He should be back soon.

504
00:51:33,926 --> 00:51:37,221
Never strays too far from
home on his day off.

505
00:51:37,346 --> 00:51:39,807
D'you want some tea?

506
00:51:43,227 --> 00:51:45,938
Thanks for coming over.

507
00:51:46,063 --> 00:51:48,566
I wanted to ask you
if dad and I went away,

508
00:51:48,691 --> 00:51:51,277
would you look after the restaurant?

509
00:51:51,402 --> 00:51:53,279
Probably heard I'm...

510
00:51:53,404 --> 00:51:54,989
Yeah.

511
00:51:55,114 --> 00:51:56,782
None of my business.

512
00:51:56,907 --> 00:51:59,201
She's an obstetrician.

513
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,413
Thanks.

514
00:52:09,086 --> 00:52:11,630
Is there someone...

515
00:52:46,665 --> 00:52:49,418
It's time to go now.

516
00:52:49,543 --> 00:52:52,171
I'm staying here, thanks.

517
00:52:52,296 --> 00:52:55,049
Are you threatening her?

518
00:52:55,174 --> 00:52:57,593
You've no right to be here.

519
00:52:57,718 --> 00:53:01,388
It's unfortunate that you're here, Claire.

520
00:53:01,514 --> 00:53:05,017
I want you to know that I'm truly sorry.

521
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:09,647
No. No, no!

522
00:53:09,772 --> 00:53:12,650
No, no, no, no!

523
00:53:23,285 --> 00:53:24,537
No!

524
00:53:24,662 --> 00:53:26,872
Get off me!

525
00:53:27,623 --> 00:53:30,918
You're halfway through your term, Faith.

526
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:36,465
You need to sleep now.

527
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,784
Dad. Dad, wake up.

528
00:54:44,909 --> 00:54:46,869
Dad.

529
00:54:47,745 --> 00:54:51,373
Dad, please. Please, wake up, please.

530
00:54:51,832 --> 00:54:53,375
Dad, I have to go for help.

531
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:55,795
Okay?

532
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:59,673
I'll come back for you, I swear.

533
00:55:56,105 --> 00:55:58,649
Jeremy, downstairs.

534
00:56:28,637 --> 00:56:31,182
That's not what I asked.

535
00:56:31,307 --> 00:56:35,227
Jeremy, everything is ready.

536
00:56:35,352 --> 00:56:40,274
I mean, every single thing is ready.

537
00:56:40,399 --> 00:56:42,359
No, no. That's not good enough.

538
00:56:42,485 --> 00:56:45,237
You go back, you check
everything and you come back

539
00:56:45,362 --> 00:56:47,907
and you tell me that
everything is in place.

540
00:56:48,032 --> 00:56:51,869
Six weeks, six days, six hours.

541
00:56:51,994 --> 00:56:53,704
We have to be ready.

542
00:56:53,829 --> 00:56:59,585
She is very close
and she is going to wake soon.

543
00:57:42,586 --> 00:57:45,381
Mrs. Fincher, can I go
to the bathroom, please?

544
00:57:45,506 --> 00:57:48,092
Two minutes.

545
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:56,559
Where the fuck have you
been for three weeks?

546
00:57:56,684 --> 00:57:58,477
And how come you're pregnant?

547
00:57:58,602 --> 00:58:01,522
- Three weeks?
- How come you're pregnant?

548
00:58:01,647 --> 00:58:03,607
And where's Brian?

549
00:58:03,733 --> 00:58:05,735
Amy, I'm in trouble.

550
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,695
No kidding.

551
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:10,531
Please.

552
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:14,869
Faith, you're my friend.

553
00:58:26,756 --> 00:58:28,299
Here, put this on.

554
00:58:28,424 --> 00:58:30,342
How d'you know I was gonna be in detention?

555
00:58:30,468 --> 00:58:33,053
Smart guess.

556
00:58:33,554 --> 00:58:34,805
Shit.

557
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:36,557
Fuck.

558
00:58:36,682 --> 00:58:37,933
Amy.

559
00:58:38,726 --> 00:58:40,061
Amy!

560
00:58:40,186 --> 00:58:41,479
Come on. Go, go, go.

561
00:58:41,604 --> 00:58:42,605
Amy, Amy, Amy.

562
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:43,689
Get off the bike.

563
00:58:43,814 --> 00:58:46,233
No, get off!

564
00:58:53,616 --> 00:58:55,785
Go!

565
00:59:09,298 --> 00:59:11,092
Fuck!

566
00:59:11,217 --> 00:59:13,886
Fuck! Fuck.

567
00:59:37,618 --> 00:59:40,746
Oh, Amy, the baby's coming.
The baby's coming.

568
00:59:41,163 --> 00:59:44,083
I have to push. I have to push.

569
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:12,945
Okay. Lay down.

570
01:00:15,364 --> 01:00:17,533
Are you okay?

571
01:00:20,911 --> 01:00:22,121
Water. Get me some water.

572
01:00:22,246 --> 01:00:24,790
- Water.
- Water.

573
01:00:28,085 --> 01:00:29,086
Damn.

574
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:31,922
Get me up, get me up, get me up.

575
01:00:32,047 --> 01:00:33,758
Okay.

576
01:00:33,883 --> 01:00:35,843
It's alright.

577
01:00:35,968 --> 01:00:38,012
Give me your weight.

578
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,020
- I need to push, I need to push.
- Okay, okay, okay.

579
01:00:46,145 --> 01:00:49,899
- Take my pants off, take my pants off.
- Okay, okay.

580
01:00:52,109 --> 01:00:54,570
Good girl, okay.

581
01:00:55,738 --> 01:00:56,864
I'm here. I'm here for you.

582
01:00:56,989 --> 01:00:59,575
I'm here, Faith. I'm here, Faith.

583
01:01:31,107 --> 01:01:33,109
Again, again, again.

584
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,156
Oh, my God.

585
01:01:39,281 --> 01:01:40,491
Just keep pushing.

586
01:01:40,616 --> 01:01:42,243
- Keep pushing, Faith.
- I can't.

587
01:01:42,368 --> 01:01:44,745
Come on, keep pushing. Come on.

588
01:02:03,472 --> 01:02:05,599
Hang on.

589
01:02:19,697 --> 01:02:22,742
I need to get some stuff
to look after you.

590
01:02:22,867 --> 01:02:25,828
If I go to the shop, will you be okay?

591
01:02:31,041 --> 01:02:33,919
Thank you.

592
01:02:34,044 --> 01:02:36,672
It's nothing.

593
01:02:37,339 --> 01:02:39,884
Be back soon.

594
01:04:19,567 --> 01:04:21,360
Faith?

595
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,332
Faith?

596
01:04:42,089 --> 01:04:44,508
Faith!

597
01:04:48,554 --> 01:04:51,557
We had an agreement, Faith.

598
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:57,730
I cured your father,
now you have to give me the baby.

599
01:04:59,982 --> 01:05:04,278
If I kill him, it's for good.

600
01:05:05,154 --> 01:05:06,947
Have it your way.

601
01:05:07,073 --> 01:05:09,241
Stop!

602
01:05:13,245 --> 01:05:15,748
Good girl.

603
01:05:18,584 --> 01:05:21,921
Oh, Faith.

604
01:05:30,137 --> 01:05:31,097
Dad.

605
01:05:31,222 --> 01:05:33,015
Dad, are you okay? Did they hurt you?

606
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,934
Dad? Dad, it's gonna be okay.

607
01:05:35,059 --> 01:05:36,060
It's gonna be okay.

608
01:05:36,185 --> 01:05:38,813
Here is our future.

609
01:05:39,772 --> 01:05:43,275
- Our key to the dark life.
- Get off.

610
01:05:43,692 --> 01:05:44,735
Dad. Dad. Get up.

611
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:47,196
His blood will set us free

612
01:05:47,321 --> 01:05:51,075
and bring the Underworld to our service.

613
01:05:51,367 --> 01:05:53,160
Our time has almost come.

614
01:05:53,285 --> 01:05:55,121
Dad, are you okay? Dad!

615
01:05:55,246 --> 01:05:57,206
We must make the final sacrifice.

616
01:05:57,331 --> 01:06:00,126
Jeremy, no! Jeremy!

617
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:02,211
Jeremy, what are you doing?

618
01:06:02,336 --> 01:06:04,463
Jeremy, no!

619
01:06:08,342 --> 01:06:09,760
Oh, fuck!

620
01:06:24,316 --> 01:06:26,402
Get out.

621
01:06:48,382 --> 01:06:51,010
Dad... Dad...

622
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:31,759
Faith.

623
01:07:33,052 --> 01:07:35,930
She cheated us, Faith.

624
01:07:36,597 --> 01:07:39,642
She cheated you and me.

625
01:07:44,563 --> 01:07:48,317
And now she plans to kill the child.

626
01:07:50,486 --> 01:07:53,322
Don't let her do it.

627
01:07:57,368 --> 01:08:01,288
I can enter the realm but not
the Chamber. You can.

628
01:08:01,414 --> 01:08:04,750
You can save him.

629
01:08:07,378 --> 01:08:12,049
You must save him.

630
01:09:44,141 --> 01:09:46,644
Brothers and sisters,

631
01:09:46,769 --> 01:09:50,898
tonight we end the journey.

632
01:09:51,023 --> 01:09:53,943
When I came back among you,
you reached down to the world

633
01:09:54,068 --> 01:09:57,405
beneath and drew up its power,

634
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:58,948
its familiars.

635
01:09:59,073 --> 01:10:04,912
They served us and we served their master.

636
01:10:10,376 --> 01:10:12,253
I reject the good. I reject the light.

637
01:10:12,378 --> 01:10:16,090
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

638
01:10:16,882 --> 01:10:21,762
I bleed this body to free ourselves

639
01:10:21,887 --> 01:10:24,974
No more mortals, weak and cowed.

640
01:10:25,099 --> 01:10:29,270
We will walk the night, strong and proud.

641
01:10:29,395 --> 01:10:32,648
Death is the beginning of everything.

642
01:10:32,773 --> 01:10:35,443
Death is the beginning of everything.

643
01:10:35,568 --> 01:10:38,571
Death is the beginning of everything.

644
01:10:53,669 --> 01:10:56,547
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

645
01:10:56,672 --> 01:10:58,966
I reject the good. I reject the light.

646
01:10:59,091 --> 01:11:01,469
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

647
01:11:01,594 --> 01:11:04,055
I reject the good. I reject the light.

648
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:06,640
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

649
01:11:06,766 --> 01:11:09,477
I reject the good. I reject the light.

650
01:11:24,784 --> 01:11:27,453
We're gonna bleed you and your baby.

651
01:11:33,292 --> 01:11:36,045
You fucking bitch.

652
01:11:46,972 --> 01:11:55,147
We gave him his child
and now I sell myself.

653
01:11:55,356 --> 01:11:58,943
I will drink his child's blood
and I will transform.

654
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:07,201
I will become Queen of the Underworld.

655
01:12:07,326 --> 01:12:11,872
Join me, and let our bodies rot and die.

656
01:12:11,997 --> 01:12:14,208
And in the first rays of the coming day

657
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:19,505
our new skin will change forever.

658
01:12:20,673 --> 01:12:23,217
I reject the good. I reject the light.

659
01:12:23,342 --> 01:12:26,512
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

660
01:12:26,637 --> 01:12:28,889
I reject the good. I reject the light.

661
01:12:29,014 --> 01:12:31,392
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

662
01:12:31,517 --> 01:12:33,811
I reject the good. I reject the light.

663
01:12:33,936 --> 01:12:36,480
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

664
01:12:36,605 --> 01:12:39,066
I reject the good. I reject the light.

665
01:12:39,191 --> 01:12:42,194
I embrace the dark. I embrace the night.

666
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:44,196
I bleed this body of its life

667
01:12:44,321 --> 01:12:47,575
to free us of what we used to be.

668
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,911
No more mortals, weak and cowed.

669
01:12:51,036 --> 01:12:54,874
We will walk the night, strong and proud.

670
01:12:54,999 --> 01:12:57,877
- Death...
- ...is the beginning

671
01:12:58,002 --> 01:13:00,087
- Death...
- ...is the beginning.

672
01:13:00,337 --> 01:13:02,381
- Death...
- ...is the beginning.

673
01:13:02,506 --> 01:13:04,717
- Death...
- ...is the beginning.

674
01:13:04,842 --> 01:13:06,719
- Death...
- ...is the beginning.

675
01:13:06,844 --> 01:13:09,263
- Death...
- ...is the beginning.

676
01:13:09,388 --> 01:13:11,432
- Death...
- ...is the beginning.

677
01:13:11,557 --> 01:13:14,060
- Death...
- ...is the beginning.

678
01:13:15,394 --> 01:13:17,730
...of everything.

679
01:13:17,855 --> 01:13:20,107
Bleed, bleed, bleed, bleed...

680
01:13:20,232 --> 01:13:22,234
No! No!

681
01:13:23,486 --> 01:13:26,322
No!

682
01:14:57,538 --> 01:15:01,000
Why aren't you dead?

683
01:15:02,626 --> 01:15:05,504
Are you stealing my property?

684
01:15:05,629 --> 01:15:08,841
How could you kill a baby?

685
01:15:09,133 --> 01:15:13,554
The child's blood is imbued
with the power of the Underworld.

686
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:17,433
When the sun rises,
the process will be complete.

687
01:15:17,558 --> 01:15:22,521
We will renew, and the day
and the night will be ours.

688
01:15:22,646 --> 01:15:25,691
We will be the greatest of witches.

689
01:15:25,816 --> 01:15:27,693
Unrivaled.

690
01:15:27,818 --> 01:15:29,904
Immortal.

691
01:15:30,029 --> 01:15:36,535
The child's remains must stay
inside the Cherry Tree.

692
01:15:37,161 --> 01:15:41,665
Give it... back!

693
01:15:46,045 --> 01:15:48,923
Stop her!

694
01:16:02,269 --> 01:16:04,271
Faith.

695
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,525
Faith.

696
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:10,277
You have to return to the Chamber.

697
01:16:10,403 --> 01:16:12,905
You can save him.

698
01:17:09,336 --> 01:17:11,130
Faith.

699
01:17:11,255 --> 01:17:13,841
You cannot save the child

700
01:17:13,966 --> 01:17:16,802
without the fruit of the Cherry Tree.

701
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:19,263
You have to return to the Chamber

702
01:17:19,388 --> 01:17:22,641
and face the witch.

703
01:17:43,579 --> 01:17:45,998
Faith.

704
01:17:46,123 --> 01:17:49,293
I knew you'd come back to me.

705
01:17:49,418 --> 01:17:52,505
You can't leave here, Sissy.

706
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:54,715
He's out there...

707
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,551
waiting.

708
01:17:58,386 --> 01:18:01,889
I know you're afraid, Faith,

709
01:18:02,014 --> 01:18:05,309
but we did this together.

710
01:18:05,434 --> 01:18:11,565
You asked me to cure
your father and I did.

711
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:14,443
If you had obeyed me,

712
01:18:14,568 --> 01:18:18,280
things would be so much better for you.

713
01:18:18,406 --> 01:18:21,617
They still can be.

714
01:18:21,742 --> 01:18:24,662
Talk to him.

715
01:18:26,956 --> 01:18:29,875
Why would I do that?

716
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,920
You have everything to gain.

717
01:18:33,045 --> 01:18:35,798
I admit I...

718
01:18:35,923 --> 01:18:38,718
misjudged things.

719
01:18:38,843 --> 01:18:40,886
But I've come to...

720
01:18:41,011 --> 01:18:45,224
I've come to truly admire you.

721
01:18:45,516 --> 01:18:51,188
Together... we could do anything.

722
01:18:51,313 --> 01:18:55,484
We could have everything.

723
01:18:56,652 --> 01:19:00,740
He's withdrawing the gift of my familiars.

724
01:19:00,865 --> 01:19:03,075
You can stop him.

725
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,996
You've taken away
everything I've ever loved.

726
01:19:07,121 --> 01:19:10,124
I'm just taking it back.

727
01:19:45,201 --> 01:19:47,745
Enjoy Hell.

728
01:22:03,881 --> 01:22:05,341
Come on, let's call here.

729
01:22:05,466 --> 01:22:07,510
But it's haunted, remember?

730
01:22:07,635 --> 01:22:10,846
That's why we've got to, right?

731
01:22:11,013 --> 01:22:13,432
Come on, it'll be cool.

732
01:22:36,163 --> 01:22:37,748
Trick or treat.

733
01:22:37,873 --> 01:22:40,251
Wow. Don't you all look so scary.

734
01:22:40,376 --> 01:22:43,087
Would anybody like a carrot?

735
01:22:43,212 --> 01:22:45,756
No? Well, maybe I have
something else inside.

736
01:22:45,881 --> 01:22:48,217
I'll have a look.

737
01:22:48,759 --> 01:22:50,553
Who's that?

738
01:22:50,678 --> 01:22:52,138
That's Sally.

739
01:22:52,263 --> 01:22:54,056
She's too scared to come in.

740
01:22:54,181 --> 01:22:57,101
Well, that's a shame, Sally,
'cause I'm all out of carrots

741
01:22:57,226 --> 01:22:59,895
but I do have some chocolate.

742
01:23:02,022 --> 01:23:04,150
Here, try some.

743
01:23:04,275 --> 01:23:05,943
It's homemade.

744
01:23:06,068 --> 01:23:07,987
Cherry flavor.

745
01:23:08,112 --> 01:23:10,698
Are you a witch?

746
01:23:10,823 --> 01:23:12,783
No.

747
01:23:13,993 --> 01:23:16,120
But my son is the Devil.
