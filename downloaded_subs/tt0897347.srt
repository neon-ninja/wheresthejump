2
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:51,757
Listen...

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Listen!

4
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:07,773
Do you hear it?

5
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,724
Go away!

6
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,457
You all have to go away!

7
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:30,398
No!

8
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:48,853
It's not in my head.

9
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:51,359
Bobby.

10
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:54,453
Bobby, where are you?

11
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,157
Bobby.

12
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:02,432
Bobby, why aren't you here?

13
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:08,911
It's happening again.

14
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:11,176
Shh, shh...

15
00:02:14,484 --> 00:02:17,476
They're after me.

16
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:24,093
I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.

17
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:26,819
You hear them, don't you?

18
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:37,769
No.

19
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:38,874
No!

20
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,779
Well, they're hiring
non-unions...

21
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,450
...down at sanitation,
if you're interested.

22
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,885
There's nothing
in transportation?

23
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:23,986
Not at the moment.

24
00:03:23,987 --> 00:03:27,617
Do you have any other
job skills?

25
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,785
Good mechanic.

26
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:34,029
Got a lot of mechanics waiting
for work already.

27
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,466
All right, now what time will I
expect you to call me tonight?

28
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,095
About what?

29
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:41,937
Well, it says here you got
a board release.

30
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:45,613
Do you understand
what that means?

31
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:47,776
I've never done this before.

32
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:50,412
It means parole
on a short leash.

33
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:51,513
So you call...

34
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:53,315
...in the next 24 hours
and let me know...

35
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,418
...where you're parking
yourself tonight.

36
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:59,355
I'm staying at my mother's.

37
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:00,456
All right.

38
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:04,827
You come in every Tuesday
for the next six months.

39
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,296
Now, this is important,
because you miss one...,

40
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:10,232
...you're in violation.

41
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,067
Does your mother know
you're staying with her?

42
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:13,068
No.

43
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,772
Well, don't you think
you should call and tell her?

44
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:19,783
She died while I was inside.

45
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:22,711
I'm sorry to hear that.

46
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:25,817
Do you have any other family?

47
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,954
Call him in the morning.

48
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:33,946
He may have work.

49
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:35,324
Not a lot of employers...

50
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:39,715
...want to hire people
in your situation.

51
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,852
Need something?

52
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,714
Helen Reynolds' son.

53
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:06,815
I left you that message.

54
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:07,916
Oh, yeah, yeah.

55
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:11,011
Of course, 519.

56
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,113
Wait here.

57
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:27,703
I don't know where I'm going.

58
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:29,519
Elevator to five.

59
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:35,277
Had to go in to change
the locks, you know?

60
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:36,283
How come?

61
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:38,080
Well, the police had to break
the door open...,

62
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:40,215
...you know, when they found her.

63
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:42,451
I didn't charge you for it,
though.

64
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:44,283
Thanks.

65
00:06:58,134 --> 00:06:59,761
Going up?

66
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,784
Ow!

67
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:52,918
Damn it.

68
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:22,891
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

69
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:23,992
Where were you?

70
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,561
I was just here
inside the house.

71
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:28,163
You were just here inside
of the house.

72
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,698
Now, how come I saw you
out by that door?

73
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:33,139
What are you doing at that door?

74
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:37,706
You weren't there?

75
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:40,699
What, am I seeing things?

76
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,163
I really don't understand.

77
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:03,169
What happened here?

78
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:22,350
Oh, there's another story again.

79
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:23,552
No, it's not a story.

80
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,612
She wanted to play.

81
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,155
She can play inside
the apartment.

82
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:32,841
Why do you have to play with her
out in the hallway?

83
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,400
I'll be right with you.

84
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:54,676
What do you guys want?

85
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:55,777
Tell me what's good here.

86
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:58,679
Listen.

87
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:00,942
Hey.

88
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:07,046
Can you excuse me?

89
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,282
Hi.

90
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:13,984
When did you get back?

91
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:16,294
A couple days.

92
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,556
Are you here for good?

93
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,819
I hope so.

94
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,145
I'm sorry about your mom...
I...I heard what happened.

95
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:34,105
Yeah, it's...

96
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:35,317
You look great.

97
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:37,149
No, no, I don't.

98
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:40,055
You don't have to say that.

99
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:42,190
Maybe a cup of coffee
or something later?

100
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,192
I can't.
I have finals.

101
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,194
School?
You're going to school?

102
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,628
Yep.

103
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,355
That's amazing.

104
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:51,566
I have to design
an entire line by next week.

105
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:54,400
It's...

106
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,338
...everything's really different
for me now.

107
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:57,672
Yeah, maybe another time.

108
00:15:57,673 --> 00:15:59,874
Maybe this weekend, maybe...

109
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,143
I'm working doubles
and school...,

110
00:16:02,144 --> 00:16:06,059
...and, look,
I have zero free time.

111
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:09,084
I don't think it's a good idea.

112
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:12,095
Can we get the bill, please?

113
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:13,288
I'm sorry.

114
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:16,224
I have to get back to work.

115
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,325
It's good to see you.

116
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:18,326
You too.

117
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,460
Help me.

118
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:52,652
See anything wrong?

119
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:55,590
Got to be a loose
brake pad spring.

120
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:56,691
You're sure about that?

121
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:57,859
Guy complained of a rattle...

122
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,461
...when he drives over bumps,
right?

123
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:01,089
That's right.

124
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:03,498
You know how to check for
misfires in alignment pressure?

125
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,435
Yeah.

126
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:12,607
Look, I've got to be honest
with you.

127
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:13,708
Involuntary manslaughter...,

128
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:15,243
...that's not exactly
a minor offense, you know?

129
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:17,745
If I had more to offer you
than my word...,

130
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:18,847
...I would give it to you, man.

131
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:24,198
But I'm just trying to put
my life back together.

132
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:27,088
Pay ain't high.

133
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:29,649
I don't need much.

134
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,295
If I hire you, I just ask you
to be straight with me.

135
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:35,396
All right?

136
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:37,031
It took me a long time
to build this shop...,

137
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,500
...and I don't want anything
risking that.

138
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:39,601
You understand?

139
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:43,638
Give me one week,
and I'll show you what I can do.

140
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:45,640
Come back tomorrow.

141
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:46,741
Thank you.

142
00:18:46,742 --> 00:18:49,302
All right.

143
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:50,751
Sir, get up.

144
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:08,293
It's suppertime.

145
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,167
He won't answer.

146
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:15,303
Got some plumbing problems,
I think.

147
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:19,459
Like, I'm hearing noises
in the walls.

148
00:19:34,123 --> 00:19:36,178
Patrol and unit 25.

149
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:48,237
We get calls.

150
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,934
This is a code four
on First and Broadway.

151
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:54,047
Code two.

152
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:56,737
Get 6544.

153
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:36,348
Great.

154
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,358
Miss Trupiano?

155
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:45,825
Bobby Reynolds.

156
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:46,928
Yeah.

157
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:48,730
Yeah, from high school.

158
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:53,668
Uh, yeah, I was released.

159
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:56,499
Is Louis there?

160
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:58,505
Oh, yeah?

161
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:02,477
You got a forwarding number
maybe or...

162
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:05,038
Hello?

163
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:08,139
Hello?

164
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:13,655
She's got the dirty mouth
from the South.

165
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:15,657
All the way from Pascagoula,
Mississippi...,

166
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:17,903
...it's Molly Ritter.

167
00:23:32,594 --> 00:23:35,363
You handle all the apartments
in the building, man?

168
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:36,731
Who's been in mine?

169
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:38,566
You have the only key.

170
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:40,398
Everything okay?

171
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:44,867
I found these.

172
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:49,677
They're fingernails.

173
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,912
I know what they are, man.

174
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:52,280
Why...why are they in my place?

175
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:53,381
Who would keep 'em?

176
00:23:53,382 --> 00:23:55,650
Maybe they belong
to your mother?

177
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:58,136
Why would she keep 'em?

178
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:02,261
When did you
speak to her last?

179
00:24:02,324 --> 00:24:03,424
Couple of years.

180
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:06,093
Yeah, you shouldn't have
to hear this from me...,

181
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:08,896
...but the neighbors heard
from the police.

182
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:11,933
Your mother locked herself
in her apartment for weeks...

183
00:24:11,934 --> 00:24:15,392
...before she died.

184
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:18,871
What?

185
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:20,608
You got any idea
why she would do that?

186
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:22,372
No idea.

187
00:24:22,478 --> 00:24:23,911
I started work here after.

188
00:24:23,912 --> 00:24:25,480
I never met her.

189
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:28,082
But when they found her,
she was in real bad shape.

190
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:31,314
You never knew about this?

191
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,588
Nobody check in on her?

192
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:37,389
She didn't have
anybody else, man.

193
00:24:37,493 --> 00:24:39,260
Maybe one of the neighbors
upstairs knows more.

194
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:40,361
Well, no offense, son...,

195
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:42,363
...but nobody here wants
to talk to you.

196
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:44,765
Everybody knows you were
in prison.

197
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:46,666
People talk.

198
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:48,970
She was sick, real sick.

199
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:49,971
Yeah.

200
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,906
You...you gonna check
on those noises?

201
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,040
What noises?

202
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,441
In the walls.

203
00:24:54,476 --> 00:24:55,643
Rusty pipes, I don't know.

204
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:57,845
They're coming
from somewhere, man.

205
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:59,814
Well, this is a prewar building.

206
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:01,082
You know, walls are thick.

207
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,884
There's vents running through
the ceiling.

208
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:04,619
There's no sound.

209
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:09,300
You seem to be the only one
hearing things.

210
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,601
- I wasn't there.
- You weren't there?

211
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,938
What am I...
am I seeing things?

212
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,640
I...I don't know what you're
talking about.

213
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:27,642
Why do you keep lying to me
all the time?

214
00:25:27,643 --> 00:25:28,743
I'm not lying to you.

215
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:29,911
What, I go to work all day.

216
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:31,212
I come home and what?

217
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:32,380
No, just just stop.

218
00:25:32,381 --> 00:25:33,481
Who is this guy?

219
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:34,482
Stop.

220
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:35,607
Stop it.

221
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:37,116
Please.

222
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:39,186
Well, you're acting like I'm...
what, like...what am I?

223
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:40,288
Am I the bad guy here?

224
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,455
You're the one that's out...

225
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,690
No, no, no, no,
I didn't say that.

226
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:43,791
I didn't say it.

227
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,459
Well, what the hell
were you doing there?

228
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,328
I wasn't doing anything.

229
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:49,096
I don't want to catch you
by that door again.

230
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:52,089
Are you all right in there?

231
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:13,688
All right, we'll start you off
with tune-ups.

232
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:15,122
We'll see how fast you work.

233
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:17,124
You're also going to bring
the cars in and park them...

234
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,426
...behind the gate every night.

235
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:20,127
It's freshman work,
but you're the new guy.

236
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:21,295
You show me you got skills,

237
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:22,964
I'll give you more shifts
and bigger jobs.

238
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:24,495
You hear that?

239
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,195
What?

240
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:28,737
Like a voice.

241
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:30,571
It's a valve grinder.

242
00:26:30,572 --> 00:26:34,133
Car keys are in there.

243
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:40,149
What is that?

244
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,649
That's the drop-box.

245
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,453
Don't give keys out till
the customer's paid in full.

246
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:46,554
You got it?

247
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:49,390
Had a lot of cars jacked
from this shop.

248
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:52,593
Can't risk that kind
of nonsense anymore.

249
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:54,425
Yo!

250
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,293
You with me?

251
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:01,426
Yeah.

252
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,060
Yeah.

253
00:27:03,171 --> 00:27:04,171
Good.

254
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:06,035
Get to work.

255
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:21,979
Two sugars, no milk.

256
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,910
I switched to Sweet'N Low.

257
00:27:24,993 --> 00:27:30,090
Are you gonna knock it,
or you gonna drink it?

258
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:37,772
You call anyone
from the neighborhood yet?

259
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:39,340
Yeah, I called around.

260
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:41,542
Seems like everybody moved away.

261
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:42,942
Hmm.

262
00:27:43,045 --> 00:27:44,578
People grew up.

263
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:48,616
Things ain't what
they used to be, right?

264
00:27:48,617 --> 00:27:50,384
Did you think everything
would be the same?

265
00:27:50,385 --> 00:27:54,110
I was hoping
some things would be.

266
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:56,891
Bobby...

267
00:27:56,992 --> 00:27:58,292
I know you got questions.

268
00:27:58,293 --> 00:27:59,493
No, no,
I don't have questions.

269
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:00,594
I had questions...,

270
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,997
...had questions for the past
few years.

271
00:28:02,998 --> 00:28:07,968
I stopped asking them
when you stopped writing.

272
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:13,129
I didn't know if you were alive
or coming back.

273
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:18,045
Why on Earth
would you just cut me off?

274
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:20,214
I thought I was
doing it for you.

275
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:21,546
For me?

276
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,851
Nothing that happened in there...

277
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:28,823
...was anything that we could have
talked about.

278
00:28:28,824 --> 00:28:30,758
So what did you think
was going to happen here?

279
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,860
You show up out of thin air...,

280
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:35,796
...bring me coffee,
and I forgive you?

281
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:40,857
You don't think people deserve
a second chance?

282
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,064
Bobby.

283
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:49,948
You want to come by
the apartment some time?

284
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:51,612
Maybe.

285
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:54,682
I'll take maybe.

286
00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:55,783
Maybe...

287
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:57,818
...I got to go.

288
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:21,483
Can I help you?

289
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:25,473
No.

290
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:31,041
What are you doing?

291
00:29:32,654 --> 00:29:34,355
Are they coming from you?

292
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:38,292
The sounds, is that you?

293
00:29:38,393 --> 00:29:39,860
Maybe the woman?

294
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,125
What did you say?

295
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:44,632
There's a woman who lives here.

296
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:45,733
I've seen her at your...

297
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:47,735
You don't know anything
about who lives here, man.

298
00:29:47,736 --> 00:29:50,000
You hear them.

299
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:54,631
Don't you?

300
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,128
Ah!

301
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:55,362
What?
Am I the bad guy here?

302
00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:57,298
No, no, no, no,
I didn't say that.

303
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:58,399
I didn't say it.

304
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,534
Well, what the hell are you
doing there?

305
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:02,202
I wasn't doing anything.

306
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:03,938
I don't want to catch you
by that door again.

307
00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:05,806
Do you understand?

308
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:07,035
Understand?

309
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:08,709
Do you understand me?

310
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,810
Do you understand?

311
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:11,771
You're hurting me!

312
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:15,249
There you go!

313
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,975
Don't you ever do that...

314
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,353
Oh...

315
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,159
Ew.

316
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,664
Listen.

317
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:06,206
Shh, shh...

318
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,299
Do you hear it?

319
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:22,045
No, no.

320
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:32,691
It's not in my head.

321
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:36,870
Bobby.

322
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:39,439
Bobby, where are you?

323
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,201
Bobby!

324
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:44,224
Bobby, why aren't you here?

325
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:46,313
Oh, it's happening again.

326
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:47,319
Shh, shh.

327
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:50,441
They're after me.

328
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:52,719
I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.

329
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,445
You hear them, don't you?

330
00:37:57,592 --> 00:37:59,660
You hear them, don't you?

331
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:00,661
Oh, no.

332
00:38:00,762 --> 00:38:02,662
No!

333
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,911
Going to the lobby?

334
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:23,193
Hello?

335
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:44,814
Do you know if he's in there?

336
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,808
Hello?

337
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,945
Bobby?

338
00:42:55,056 --> 00:42:58,219
Your door's open.

339
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:05,021
Hello?

340
00:43:43,604 --> 00:43:47,062
You came.

341
00:43:47,174 --> 00:43:48,274
How'd you get in?

342
00:43:48,275 --> 00:43:50,330
Your door was open.

343
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:53,918
You okay?

344
00:43:54,015 --> 00:43:55,505
Yeah.

345
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:57,017
Who...who lives
in that apartment?

346
00:43:57,018 --> 00:43:59,919
Nosy neighbors.

347
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:01,588
I guess they don't feel
too comfortable...

348
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:05,219
...with an ex-con in the building.

349
00:44:07,595 --> 00:44:08,595
Wow.

350
00:44:08,696 --> 00:44:11,164
Yeah, it's hers.

351
00:44:11,265 --> 00:44:13,967
All this...
all this is hers.

352
00:44:13,968 --> 00:44:16,936
I don't know what to do with it.

353
00:44:16,937 --> 00:44:19,269
Well, it's kind of...

354
00:44:19,373 --> 00:44:20,373
Vintage?

355
00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:22,032
Ugly.

356
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,444
Do you like it here?

357
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,812
Getting used to it.

358
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,586
Everybody here
seems a little off.

359
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,597
Well, it's the East Village.

360
00:44:39,894 --> 00:44:41,862
She looks happy.

361
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:46,365
I don't think she was.

362
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:48,901
She was on medication.

363
00:44:49,003 --> 00:44:51,337
It got so bad that, uh...,

364
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:57,338
...uh, she stayed here
at the apartment for weeks...

365
00:44:58,646 --> 00:45:04,646
...and didn't leave until
eventually she starved to death.

366
00:45:08,022 --> 00:45:10,557
I don't know if it was suicide.

367
00:45:10,558 --> 00:45:11,848
Nobody does.

368
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,360
I can't even go in her bedroom.

369
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:17,421
It sounds crazy, but I...

370
00:45:17,531 --> 00:45:22,066
...I feel sometimes
like she's still here.

371
00:45:22,503 --> 00:45:26,468
Bobby, it's gonna take time
to heal.

372
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,313
These are amazing.

373
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:36,477
They're just rough sketches.

374
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,290
What?

375
00:45:46,427 --> 00:45:51,152
Do you ever wonder what would
have happened?

376
00:45:54,702 --> 00:45:55,752
Sometimes.

377
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:01,968
Do you?

378
00:46:02,076 --> 00:46:03,839
Every day.

379
00:46:09,984 --> 00:46:11,849
What was it like?

380
00:46:15,456 --> 00:46:18,619
Isolating.

381
00:46:18,726 --> 00:46:24,026
But at the same time,
you never have any privacy.

382
00:46:24,498 --> 00:46:27,433
You just hang onto the stuff
you had, you know, before, the...

383
00:46:27,434 --> 00:46:29,439
...the good things.

384
00:46:37,077 --> 00:46:38,178
It's late.

385
00:46:38,179 --> 00:46:41,615
I should go.

386
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:45,583
Yeah.

387
00:47:01,001 --> 00:47:02,202
It's good to see you.

388
00:47:02,203 --> 00:47:04,637
You too.

389
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:35,291
Please, somebody help us!

390
00:47:41,175 --> 00:47:42,506
Hang on.

391
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:49,787
You okay?

392
00:47:56,724 --> 00:47:57,724
Miss?

393
00:47:59,493 --> 00:48:03,020
Miss?

394
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,123
You need some help
with something?

395
00:48:14,074 --> 00:48:16,508
Whatever it is...,

396
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:21,385
...I'm right next door
if you need anything.

397
00:48:38,198 --> 00:48:40,203
You need something?

398
00:48:42,636 --> 00:48:46,539
I want you to mind
your own business, okay?

399
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,540
Huh?

400
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:13,789
Please open the door.

401
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,505
These measurements are incorrect.

402
00:49:52,506 --> 00:49:53,606
Are you sure?

403
00:49:53,607 --> 00:49:56,701
Yeah, look at this.

404
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:59,112
Senior collection's
going up Friday...,

405
00:49:59,113 --> 00:50:02,648
...and you haven't even sewn yet.

406
00:50:04,284 --> 00:50:06,484
I went to see Bobby.

407
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:11,417
I saw a woman standing
at his door.

408
00:50:11,525 --> 00:50:15,894
She was crying.

409
00:50:15,996 --> 00:50:17,481
I don't know.

410
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:20,933
I...I suppose he doesn't owe me
an explanation or anything.

411
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:24,609
- You still have feelings
for him.

412
00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:28,672
I don't know.

413
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:29,776
Maybe.

414
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,879
What if I do?

415
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:37,756
What am I supposed
to do about it?

416
00:50:37,818 --> 00:50:41,978
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

417
00:50:49,263 --> 00:50:53,700
Somebody help us!

418
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:56,435
Come here!

419
00:50:56,437 --> 00:50:59,017
Come here!
Get in here.

420
00:50:59,773 --> 00:51:00,873
Let Carly go.

421
00:51:00,874 --> 00:51:02,535
Run, baby, run!

422
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:06,841
Look at me.

423
00:51:06,947 --> 00:51:08,847
Carly...
Carly!

424
00:51:08,949 --> 00:51:12,154
Do what you have to do to me!

425
00:51:13,787 --> 00:51:14,887
Where are you going?

426
00:51:14,888 --> 00:51:17,755
Fuck this.

427
00:51:17,858 --> 00:51:19,492
You weren't there?

428
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,861
What, am I...
am I seeing things?

429
00:51:21,862 --> 00:51:24,387
You okay?

430
00:51:28,268 --> 00:51:30,470
What, I go to work all day.

431
00:51:30,471 --> 00:51:31,838
Here, come in.

432
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:32,939
It's okay.

433
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,205
Come on.

434
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,378
What's your name?
Am I the bad guy here?

435
00:51:39,379 --> 00:51:40,480
You're the one that's out...

436
00:51:40,481 --> 00:51:41,581
No, no, no,
I didn't say that.

437
00:51:41,582 --> 00:51:42,682
I didn't say that.

438
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,117
My name is Bobby.

439
00:51:44,118 --> 00:51:47,153
I know you probably don't want
to talk to strangers, right?

440
00:51:47,154 --> 00:51:48,588
But if you tell me...

441
00:51:48,589 --> 00:51:50,623
what's going on in there,
I might be able to help you.

442
00:51:50,624 --> 00:51:54,355
You want to tell me?

443
00:51:58,765 --> 00:51:59,866
You play the piano?

444
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,232
Hey!

445
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:03,200
Listen to me.

446
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:06,739
Where were you?

447
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:07,974
Here, inside the house.

448
00:52:07,975 --> 00:52:10,009
You were just here
inside of the house?

449
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,611
So how...how come I saw you out
by that door?

450
00:52:11,612 --> 00:52:12,912
What were you doing
at that door?

451
00:52:12,913 --> 00:52:14,547
Hey, you want to play
a real piano?

452
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,648
You weren't there?

453
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:16,649
Come on.

454
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,299
Why don't we make some music
on a real piano?

455
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,554
I remember why I can't able to reach
the pedals...

456
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,789
...but I bet you can.

457
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:26,940
Stay right there.
One second.

458
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,106
What are you doing?

459
00:52:40,107 --> 00:52:44,122
Don't you dare try
to do that again!

460
00:53:08,468 --> 00:53:09,998
This is crazy.

461
00:53:11,572 --> 00:53:12,972
Stay right there.

462
00:53:12,973 --> 00:53:14,807
He's never going to hurt you
or your mother again.

463
00:53:14,808 --> 00:53:15,908
All right?

464
00:53:15,909 --> 00:53:18,444
Don't you dare do that!

465
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:26,822
Why do you keep lying to me
all the time?

466
00:53:32,092 --> 00:53:34,993
Where were you?

467
00:53:35,095 --> 00:53:36,262
No, I didn't say that.

468
00:53:36,263 --> 00:53:39,532
Well, what the hell were you
doing there?

469
00:53:39,533 --> 00:53:40,533
911!

470
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,001
What's your emergency?

471
00:53:42,002 --> 00:53:45,705
Yeah, I'm...I'm at 20 Avenue E,
apartment 519.

472
00:53:45,706 --> 00:53:48,307
The guy next door
is beating on his wife.

473
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,642
Do you understand?

474
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,110
Can you repeat the location,
please?

475
00:53:51,111 --> 00:53:52,278
20 Avenue E.

476
00:53:52,279 --> 00:53:53,646
When I tell you to stay in,
you stay in!

477
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:54,747
Sir, is anyone hurt?

478
00:53:54,748 --> 00:53:56,115
Yeah, I don't know.

479
00:53:56,116 --> 00:53:58,017
Well, just send...
you can't just send somebody?

480
00:53:58,018 --> 00:54:02,508
Sir, I need to confirm
if someone's hurt.

481
00:54:07,227 --> 00:54:09,923
I can hear you in there.

482
00:54:14,201 --> 00:54:16,035
Hug me once, okay?

483
00:54:16,036 --> 00:54:19,028
Open the goddamn door!

484
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,214
Domestic officers arrived.

485
00:54:28,215 --> 00:54:29,239
1026?

486
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:32,079
Yeah, right down here.

487
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,819
You know the tenants?

488
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,821
No.
They fight a lot.

489
00:54:35,822 --> 00:54:37,857
It got pretty bad tonight.

490
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,659
You see anything?

491
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,327
No, but there's a...
there's a little girl...,

492
00:54:41,328 --> 00:54:44,730
...and I didn't want
to take chances.

493
00:54:44,731 --> 00:54:46,646
The guy is a cop.

494
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,897
Please stand back, sir.

495
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,539
NYPD.

496
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:58,339
Anybody inside in need
of assistance?

497
00:55:00,113 --> 00:55:02,343
Open up!

498
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:04,883
Roger that.

499
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,175
This is a joke?

500
00:55:16,697 --> 00:55:18,264
Where are they?

501
00:55:18,265 --> 00:55:21,600
Are you sure this is
the apartment?

502
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:23,626
Yeah.
Yeah.

503
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,438
I...I just heard them.

504
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:31,377
It doesn't look like anyone's
lived here in a very long time.

505
00:55:31,378 --> 00:55:32,478
You been drinking tonight?

506
00:55:32,479 --> 00:55:34,965
No.
No!

507
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,216
The daughter just
visited my apartment!

508
00:55:37,217 --> 00:55:39,685
What's her name?

509
00:55:39,786 --> 00:55:41,253
I...I don't know.

510
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,722
And the wife,
the one that was beaten...,

511
00:55:42,723 --> 00:55:45,385
...do you know her name?

512
00:55:45,492 --> 00:55:46,659
She never told me.

513
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,828
Most people know a lot more...

514
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:50,896
...about their imaginary friends
than that, pal.

515
00:55:50,897 --> 00:55:53,199
You got yourself one hell
of a vivid imagination.

516
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,700
1080, cancel that call.

517
00:55:54,701 --> 00:55:56,896
104.

518
00:55:57,003 --> 00:55:59,198
They were just here!

519
00:55:59,306 --> 00:56:00,673
Look, you know what?

520
00:56:00,674 --> 00:56:02,475
Next time, just don't call us.

521
00:56:02,476 --> 00:56:03,531
Let's go.

522
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:06,569
Wasting my time, man.

523
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,065
Who lives in the apartment
next to mine?

524
00:56:26,066 --> 00:56:27,966
Why?

525
00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:29,602
Because I just called
the cops on them...,

526
00:56:29,603 --> 00:56:32,338
...and they showed up,
and there was nobody there.

527
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:35,934
So what the hell is going on?

528
00:56:38,412 --> 00:56:39,612
You called the police on who?

529
00:56:39,613 --> 00:56:41,514
On the guy in the apartment
next to mine.

530
00:56:41,515 --> 00:56:42,810
He's a cop.

531
00:56:43,917 --> 00:56:45,751
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

532
00:56:45,752 --> 00:56:46,852
That apartment's been empty...

533
00:56:46,853 --> 00:56:48,254
...ever since I started
working here.

534
00:56:48,255 --> 00:56:50,587
517, right?

535
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,021
Yeah...no.

536
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:54,760
There's...there's a girl.

537
00:56:54,761 --> 00:56:57,163
There's a kid and her mom...,

538
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:59,765
...and the dad is abusing them
all day long.

539
00:56:59,766 --> 00:57:01,167
Everybody in the place
can hear it.

540
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:02,368
Yeah, not everyone.

541
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:05,896
I've...
I've seen them.

542
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,240
Look, I've walked each and every
hall in this building.

543
00:57:08,241 --> 00:57:09,708
I know every tenant
that lives here.

544
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:12,912
I've never seen a girl
or a family in 517.

545
00:57:12,913 --> 00:57:17,308
Just you and that guy in 512
live there.

546
00:57:17,884 --> 00:57:19,909
Now, let me sleep.

547
00:58:22,382 --> 00:58:24,577
What?

548
00:58:24,684 --> 00:58:25,818
You're killing me.

549
00:58:25,819 --> 00:58:28,811
Sorry.

550
00:58:52,979 --> 00:58:54,647
We still have two more chapters.

551
00:58:54,648 --> 00:58:56,172
I got to go.

552
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:57,443
What?

553
00:58:57,551 --> 00:58:58,551
Why?

554
00:58:58,652 --> 00:59:01,678
Wait.

555
00:59:03,857 --> 00:59:05,292
Are you okay?

556
00:59:07,727 --> 00:59:08,994
It was my fault.

557
00:59:08,995 --> 00:59:11,020
What was?

558
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,599
Bobby went to jail
because of me.

559
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,036
What do you mean?

560
00:59:19,573 --> 00:59:23,203
We were at that bar
on Rivington.

561
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:26,879
Some guy followed me
into the bathroom.

562
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,181
He pushed me
up against the wall...,

563
00:59:29,182 --> 00:59:31,884
...and put his hand over my mouth.

564
00:59:31,885 --> 00:59:34,046
What?

565
00:59:36,089 --> 00:59:41,152
Next thing I know, Bobby...,

566
00:59:41,261 --> 00:59:47,261
...he hit him so hard that I heard
the bones in his face crack.

567
00:59:47,734 --> 00:59:50,999
And he didn't stop.

568
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:54,073
The more I cried,
the more Bobby hit him.

569
00:59:54,074 --> 00:59:56,414
Al, he killed someone.

570
00:59:58,878 --> 01:00:01,380
I don't know what to do.

571
01:00:01,381 --> 01:00:02,881
I mean, he did all that time.

572
01:00:02,882 --> 01:00:05,517
Maybe he'll hurt you some day.

573
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:06,819
It's...it's not him.

574
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,914
It never was.

575
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:13,049
He was only trying to help.

576
01:00:15,095 --> 01:00:19,429
I just want you
to be careful, okay?

577
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:20,556
Yeah.

578
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:20,615
What the hell's your problem,
man?

579
01:01:37,143 --> 01:01:39,198
You all right, bro?

580
01:01:39,813 --> 01:01:44,250
Uh, I got blood coming out
of my ears.

581
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:46,785
How the hell did you
do that, man?

582
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:47,886
I don't know.

583
01:01:47,887 --> 01:01:49,488
Go see a doctor.

584
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:50,823
I got to finish my shift, man.

585
01:01:50,824 --> 01:01:51,924
Go see a doctor.

586
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:53,592
Blood coming out of your ears
ain't normal.

587
01:01:53,593 --> 01:01:54,693
Are you sick or something?

588
01:01:54,694 --> 01:01:59,256
You doing okay?

589
01:01:59,365 --> 01:02:01,492
How do you mean?

590
01:02:01,601 --> 01:02:04,069
I'm not gonna pretend like
I know you...,

591
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:09,174
...but you been falling apart
since you took this job.

592
01:02:09,175 --> 01:02:15,175
Um, if I try to explain it,
it's not gonna sound right.

593
01:02:15,548 --> 01:02:18,517
When I came out of recovery,
I started over too.

594
01:02:18,518 --> 01:02:20,552
I had a sponsor to talk to
when things got out of hand.

595
01:02:20,553 --> 01:02:22,054
You know what I'm saying?

596
01:02:22,055 --> 01:02:26,125
You need someone to talk to,
or you're gonna fall apart.

597
01:02:26,126 --> 01:02:27,126
Go home.

598
01:02:27,227 --> 01:02:30,321
I'll lock up.

599
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:35,231
All right.

600
01:02:39,305 --> 01:02:40,439
I'm leaving the city.

601
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,540
I can't stay here.

602
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:42,541
Why?

603
01:02:42,642 --> 01:02:44,009
I think whatever's...

604
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,944
...whatever happened to my mother
is happening to me.

605
01:02:45,945 --> 01:02:48,614
And I...I just...
I just got to make it stop.

606
01:02:48,615 --> 01:02:49,707
What?

607
01:02:49,816 --> 01:02:52,979
What?

608
01:02:53,086 --> 01:02:56,455
I'm hear...I'm hearing sounds...,

609
01:02:56,456 --> 01:03:01,136
...and I am seeing people
who aren't there.

610
01:03:01,961 --> 01:03:05,488
Bobby,
your mother was sick.

611
01:03:05,598 --> 01:03:07,998
She wasn't crazy.

612
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:10,702
Something made her crazy.

613
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:13,001
Maybe you leaving...

614
01:03:13,106 --> 01:03:16,564
...did make her depressed.

615
01:03:19,412 --> 01:03:21,013
You deserted her...,

616
01:03:21,014 --> 01:03:26,611
...like you deserted a lot
of people in your life.

617
01:03:38,865 --> 01:03:40,490
You got tables.

618
01:03:44,771 --> 01:03:46,534
I got to go.

619
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,530
Open the door!

620
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,948
Open the door, please!

621
01:05:35,949 --> 01:05:38,484
I know you're in there!

622
01:07:18,751 --> 01:07:20,352
What do you want?

623
01:07:20,353 --> 01:07:23,618
What do you want?

624
01:07:24,824 --> 01:07:27,829
- Good morning, sir.
- Yeah.

625
01:07:28,561 --> 01:07:30,028
Do you know a Joseph Wright?

626
01:07:30,029 --> 01:07:31,930
He lives down the hall from you.

627
01:07:31,931 --> 01:07:33,098
I just moved in.

628
01:07:33,099 --> 01:07:34,766
Heard anything
out of the ordinary?

629
01:07:34,767 --> 01:07:36,701
Seen anyone suspicious?

630
01:07:36,702 --> 01:07:39,637
No.

631
01:07:39,739 --> 01:07:41,873
The neighbors told us
you just got out of Rikers.

632
01:07:41,874 --> 01:07:44,468
Is that true?

633
01:07:44,577 --> 01:07:45,677
What's this about?

634
01:07:45,678 --> 01:07:47,446
Were you home all evening?

635
01:07:47,447 --> 01:07:48,847
No, I was with a friend.

636
01:07:48,848 --> 01:07:52,573
I may be back
with more questions.

637
01:08:01,527 --> 01:08:04,325
No, no.

638
01:08:08,935 --> 01:08:11,927
You didn't see anything?

639
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:31,790
Rick, you want to give me
a hand with this?

640
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:33,258
Yo, Bobby!

641
01:08:36,729 --> 01:08:38,263
You're an hour late.

642
01:08:38,264 --> 01:08:41,233
Sorry, man, there's something
going on in my building today.

643
01:08:41,234 --> 01:08:43,004
We need to talk.

644
01:08:44,604 --> 01:08:47,405
You come by the shop
last night?

645
01:08:47,406 --> 01:08:49,033
No.

646
01:08:49,142 --> 01:08:50,242
You sure you didn't come by...

647
01:08:50,243 --> 01:08:51,343
...the shop
last night after closing?

648
01:08:51,344 --> 01:08:52,606
Yeah.

649
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:54,546
There was a 300 that came in
for a tire balance.

650
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,267
You remember it?

651
01:08:56,315 --> 01:08:57,415
It wasn't mine.

652
01:08:57,416 --> 01:08:59,417
I didn't do a balance yesterday.

653
01:08:59,418 --> 01:09:00,783
It's gone.

654
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,487
I came in this morning,
it was off the lot.

655
01:09:02,488 --> 01:09:07,225
I called up the owner,
she hasn't picked it up yet.

656
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:11,811
You got something you want
to ask me, man?

657
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:14,933
Look, my other guys have been
with me for years, Bobby.

658
01:09:14,934 --> 01:09:16,368
All I got on you
is your history.

659
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:19,804
But I have a situation
with no other answer.

660
01:09:19,805 --> 01:09:21,373
If that 300 gets returned
in the next hour...,

661
01:09:21,374 --> 01:09:22,474
I won't call the cops.

662
01:09:22,475 --> 01:09:23,575
I don't have the car, man.

663
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,777
No, I'm trying to give you
the benefit of the doubt here.

664
01:09:25,778 --> 01:09:27,871
Call the cops, man.

665
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,281
I don't have the car.

666
01:09:29,282 --> 01:09:32,684
I can't keep you on until
that 300 turns up.

667
01:09:32,685 --> 01:09:33,709
Yeah.

668
01:09:33,819 --> 01:09:36,811
All right.

669
01:10:11,591 --> 01:10:14,583
Hello?

670
01:10:17,029 --> 01:10:18,621
Hello?

671
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:01,105
Yo, what's this?

672
01:11:01,207 --> 01:11:03,141
How the hell did this happen?

673
01:11:03,142 --> 01:11:04,871
Damn, man!

674
01:11:04,977 --> 01:11:06,602
Watch the shop.

675
01:12:23,322 --> 01:12:25,153
Are you okay?

676
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,041
Alyssa Foldes?
Alyssa Foldes.

677
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:44,441
Anybody...

678
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:49,674
...nobody knows her?

679
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,015
Alyssa Foldes?

680
01:12:51,016 --> 01:12:53,075
You know Alyssa?

681
01:12:53,185 --> 01:12:55,687
It's really important
that I talk to her.

682
01:12:55,688 --> 01:12:57,212
Sorry.

683
01:12:57,323 --> 01:13:00,058
I don't know where she is.

684
01:13:00,059 --> 01:13:01,253
Come on.

685
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,895
You got to help me out.

686
01:13:06,365 --> 01:13:07,966
She put a lot of trust in you.

687
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,402
And you're going to end up
hurting her again.

688
01:13:10,403 --> 01:13:12,203
She can't deal with that
in her life right now.

689
01:13:12,204 --> 01:13:13,471
You don't know
what's going on.

690
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:15,006
I know Alyssa
never showed up tonight.

691
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,107
I know she didn't turn in
her final.

692
01:13:16,108 --> 01:13:17,275
And I know she's only been
acting like this...

693
01:13:17,276 --> 01:13:18,376
...since you showed up.

694
01:13:18,377 --> 01:13:20,811
Just leave her alone.

695
01:13:20,913 --> 01:13:23,148
She knows about the other girl.

696
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:25,379
What other girl?

697
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,444
The woman at your apartment.

698
01:13:28,687 --> 01:13:29,954
Did...did Alyssa talk to her?

699
01:13:29,955 --> 01:13:31,855
Don't know.

700
01:13:31,957 --> 01:13:34,347
Just have her call me.

701
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,097
Bobby, you there?

702
01:13:43,202 --> 01:13:45,864
It's Hector.

703
01:13:45,971 --> 01:13:47,939
The city towed
the wrong car, man.

704
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:50,275
I'm sorry I doubted you.

705
01:13:50,276 --> 01:13:54,679
You still have your job
if you want it, man.

706
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,672
Bobby!

707
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:35,203
Are you all right, kid?

708
01:14:55,274 --> 01:14:57,242
Hello?

709
01:14:57,343 --> 01:14:59,573
Little girl?

710
01:14:59,678 --> 01:15:03,079
You all right?

711
01:15:04,817 --> 01:15:08,048
Hello?

712
01:15:08,153 --> 01:15:09,683
Where are you?

713
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,121
Hello?

714
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:21,222
Little girl?

715
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:06,037
Help!

716
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:07,635
Help!

717
01:16:07,746 --> 01:16:08,746
Anybody?

718
01:16:08,847 --> 01:16:14,217
Help!

719
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:20,648
Damn it!

720
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:55,954
Hello?

721
01:16:56,061 --> 01:16:57,795
Mr. Reynolds, do you know
what day it is today?

722
01:16:57,796 --> 01:16:58,896
No.
What?

723
01:16:58,897 --> 01:17:01,717
It's your weekly check-in.

724
01:17:02,434 --> 01:17:04,669
Appointments with your PO
are not optional.

725
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:06,437
I thought we understood
each other.

726
01:17:06,438 --> 01:17:07,438
Yeah.

727
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:08,631
Sorry.

728
01:17:08,741 --> 01:17:12,321
Is there something
I should know?

729
01:17:15,414 --> 01:17:16,681
Mr. Reynolds?

730
01:17:16,682 --> 01:17:18,449
I can't talk right now.

731
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:20,551
Look, let me give this to you
in vivid detail.

732
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:22,754
You speed your way...

733
01:17:22,755 --> 01:17:24,155
...into the parole office
right now...

734
01:17:24,156 --> 01:17:26,858
...or you illegally violate,
and we come looking for you.

735
01:17:26,859 --> 01:17:28,622
You get me?

736
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:33,783
Mr. Reynolds?

737
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:17,808
Help...help me!

738
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:19,911
I know you're in there!
Please!

739
01:18:19,912 --> 01:18:22,574
Please open the door!

740
01:19:09,261 --> 01:19:10,261
Bobby?

741
01:19:10,362 --> 01:19:12,853
Bobby, can you hear me?

742
01:19:12,965 --> 01:19:14,198
Look, um, those...

743
01:19:14,199 --> 01:19:16,234
...those noises that you heard,
I think...

744
01:19:16,235 --> 01:19:17,568
...I think I may be
hearing them too.

745
01:19:17,569 --> 01:19:19,103
I don't understand
what's happening.

746
01:19:19,104 --> 01:19:20,838
You were trying to tell me
something...

747
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,306
...and I didn't listen,
and I'm sorry.

748
01:19:22,307 --> 01:19:26,847
And I'm going to come
and find you, okay?

749
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,930
Open the door!

750
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:01,179
Bobby?

751
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:24,836
Think I don't know
you're in there?

752
01:20:24,837 --> 01:20:27,362
I don't want trouble.

753
01:20:27,472 --> 01:20:29,407
You've been watching me.
I see you in the window.

754
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:31,988
What are you looking at?

755
01:20:32,177 --> 01:20:35,707
Something happened
on that floor.

756
01:20:40,786 --> 01:20:42,854
You know something, don't you?

757
01:20:42,855 --> 01:20:46,357
There was this family
living there.

758
01:20:46,358 --> 01:20:48,826
One night...,

759
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:50,595
...the mother, she kept screaming.

760
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,587
No.

761
01:20:52,698 --> 01:20:55,861
Don't!

762
01:20:55,968 --> 01:20:58,562
But nobody helped her.

763
01:21:00,505 --> 01:21:01,772
It doesn't make sense.

764
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:03,674
You could...you could have
just called the cops.

765
01:21:03,675 --> 01:21:05,977
A lot of terrible things
happen in this city every day.

766
01:21:05,978 --> 01:21:09,280
Either we assumed someone
would call the police...,

767
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:13,006
...or we were afraid to,
or worse.

768
01:21:13,819 --> 01:21:17,448
Some of us just didn't care.

769
01:21:17,556 --> 01:21:21,566
The next morning,
they were all dead.

770
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:32,793
It's your fault.

771
01:21:36,875 --> 01:21:39,043
You could have done something.

772
01:21:39,044 --> 01:21:40,144
You let them die.

773
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,313
Any one of you,
my mother included...,

774
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:43,414
...could have saved them.

775
01:21:43,415 --> 01:21:45,781
You realize that?

776
01:21:52,591 --> 01:21:54,836
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait!

777
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,728
I'm sorry! I can't help you!

778
01:21:56,729 --> 01:21:59,549
Why...why won't they stop?

779
01:22:06,972 --> 01:22:10,203
Hello, Miss?

780
01:22:10,309 --> 01:22:11,409
Is he in there?

781
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:14,230
I really need to find him.

782
01:22:24,623 --> 01:22:28,286
Anyone home?

783
01:22:34,299 --> 01:22:38,633
Sorry, I...

784
01:22:38,737 --> 01:22:43,272
...the woman who walked
in here, do you...

785
01:24:55,107 --> 01:24:56,240
Oh, my God!

786
01:24:56,241 --> 01:24:57,241
Alyssa?

787
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:59,674
Alyssa!

788
01:24:59,778 --> 01:25:00,911
I'm so sorry.

789
01:25:00,912 --> 01:25:02,937
I'm so sorry.

790
01:25:03,048 --> 01:25:04,709
Oh, my God.

791
01:25:04,816 --> 01:25:07,446
What did they do to you?

792
01:25:11,456 --> 01:25:12,980
Oh, God.

793
01:25:13,091 --> 01:25:15,082
Oh, God.

794
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:16,193
Please.

795
01:25:16,294 --> 01:25:18,295
911...
What is your emergency?

796
01:25:18,296 --> 01:25:19,897
I...I need an ambulance.

797
01:25:19,898 --> 01:25:21,866
Please.

798
01:25:21,967 --> 01:25:25,117
What is your current location?

799
01:25:27,272 --> 01:25:28,864
Sir?

800
01:25:28,974 --> 01:25:30,744
Can you hear me?

801
01:25:31,977 --> 01:25:32,977
Sir?

802
01:25:34,412 --> 01:25:36,413
You're doing real good, honey.

803
01:25:36,414 --> 01:25:38,415
Everything's going to be okay.

804
01:25:38,416 --> 01:25:42,219
But I want you to be strong
for mommy.

805
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:43,983
You got me?

806
01:25:44,089 --> 01:25:45,756
Right.
Let me see that pretty smile.

807
01:25:45,757 --> 01:25:48,749
There.

808
01:25:57,936 --> 01:26:00,516
Hey, what are you doing?

809
01:26:02,374 --> 01:26:06,572
Please don't do this.

810
01:26:06,678 --> 01:26:11,581
Don't do what?

811
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:19,820
We're leaving.

812
01:26:24,362 --> 01:26:26,512
Why are you leaving?

813
01:26:28,066 --> 01:26:29,166
You know why.

814
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:30,267
- But you...
- Don't!

815
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:32,069
You can't leave.
Whoa, whoa.

816
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:34,030
What?
Don't what?

817
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,774
Shh, it's okay.

818
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:40,176
It's okay.

819
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:41,808
Where are you?

820
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:46,977
Here, here, here,
here, here, here.

821
01:26:48,186 --> 01:26:49,761
Listen, listen.

822
01:26:51,122 --> 01:26:52,756
You just close your eyes...

823
01:26:52,757 --> 01:26:55,626
...and go to that special place
like always.

824
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:57,094
Nothing else will matter.

825
01:26:57,095 --> 01:26:58,195
Carly, are you okay?

826
01:26:58,196 --> 01:26:59,363
Why are you crying?
What...

827
01:26:59,364 --> 01:27:00,695
No.

828
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:03,968
I...I really don't understand
what's happening here.

829
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,449
What...what...

830
01:27:07,239 --> 01:27:09,673
Why do you want to leave me?

831
01:27:09,674 --> 01:27:10,774
- Why?
- Hmm?

832
01:27:10,775 --> 01:27:12,970
Look at me.

833
01:27:13,078 --> 01:27:15,246
You did...
you did this to me.

834
01:27:15,247 --> 01:27:17,738
I didn't do that.

835
01:27:17,849 --> 01:27:20,384
Who the hell did that to you?

836
01:27:20,385 --> 01:27:22,419
Go!
Run, baby, run!

837
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:23,520
Look at me!

838
01:27:23,521 --> 01:27:24,855
Just let Carly go, please.

839
01:27:24,856 --> 01:27:27,222
Uh, Carly...

840
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:28,792
Do what you have to do to me!

841
01:27:28,793 --> 01:27:30,021
Carly.

842
01:27:30,128 --> 01:27:32,696
I don't understand
what's happening here.

843
01:27:32,697 --> 01:27:35,860
Walter.

844
01:27:39,204 --> 01:27:40,871
It's fricking making me...

845
01:27:40,872 --> 01:27:42,977
It makes me so mad!

846
01:27:43,275 --> 01:27:47,144
It's making me lose
my freakin' mind, you know.

847
01:27:47,145 --> 01:27:50,881
Why won't you just let us go,
please?

848
01:27:50,882 --> 01:27:51,882
Please.

849
01:27:51,983 --> 01:27:53,450
Baby.

850
01:27:53,551 --> 01:27:55,656
I love you so much.

851
01:27:57,622 --> 01:28:00,224
Just say it for me once okay?

852
01:28:00,225 --> 01:28:01,558
Just tell me that you love me.

853
01:28:01,559 --> 01:28:03,460
Just once.
Just say it.

854
01:28:03,461 --> 01:28:04,561
Just say that you...

855
01:28:04,562 --> 01:28:05,562
No, no!

856
01:28:05,664 --> 01:28:07,529
Somebody help us!

857
01:28:07,632 --> 01:28:08,832
Please, someone help us!

858
01:28:08,833 --> 01:28:10,834
Open this door!
Come on.

859
01:28:10,835 --> 01:28:14,737
Please.

860
01:28:14,839 --> 01:28:18,138
No, don't, please.

861
01:28:18,243 --> 01:28:23,772
No, no.

862
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:26,350
Please, somebody help us!

863
01:28:26,351 --> 01:28:27,584
Come on and help me!

864
01:28:27,585 --> 01:28:29,143
Open the door!

865
01:28:29,254 --> 01:28:30,554
Somebody help us, please!

866
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:32,022
No, Walter, no!

867
01:28:32,023 --> 01:28:33,752
No!

868
01:28:33,858 --> 01:28:35,223
No!

869
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:17,861
Walter, no!

870
01:29:17,969 --> 01:29:20,699
Stop!

871
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,440
You've got to stop it!

872
01:29:28,813 --> 01:29:31,678
You mind your own business.

873
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:36,712
Agh!

874
01:29:42,293 --> 01:29:45,854
Agh!

875
01:29:48,666 --> 01:29:50,463
No!

876
01:31:46,551 --> 01:31:48,519
Alyssa!

877
01:31:50,989 --> 01:31:52,684
Alyssa?

878
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:04,599
Oh, it's okay.

879
01:32:04,702 --> 01:32:07,694
It's okay.

880
