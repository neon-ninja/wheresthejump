1
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,265
It scares us just thinking about it.

2
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,969
When you hear it,
you're gonna think we're insane.

3
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,560
It started out small...

4
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,967
like a hand or a leg was
in a different position.

5
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,191
And then its head was
looking up instead of down...

6
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:14,070
and then one day, it was in
a completely different room.

7
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,281
It was moving around by itself.

8
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,780
Camilla got in touch with a medium.
We learned from her...

9
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,067
that the doll was possessed by
a girl named Annabelle Higgins.

10
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,838
She had lost her parents and
had taken a liking to my doll.

11
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:29,774
All she wanted was to be friends.

12
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,767
When we heard this, we felt
really sorry for her. I mean,

13
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,387
we're nurses, we help people.

14
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,386
But then things got worse.

15
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,585
How did you end up with it?

16
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,729
It was a gift from my mom,
for my birthday.

17
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,983
I don't know where she got it...

18
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,403
but we are beyond terrified.

19
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,104
God honors sacrifice.

20
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:33,942
And our sacrifices touch God's
heart and move his hand.

21
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,908
Jesus said, "This is my commandment.

22
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,658
That you love one another
as I have loved you.

23
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,949
Greater love hath no one than this...

24
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,996
that he lay down his
life for his friends."

25
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,540
I win.

26
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,342
Let us pray.

27
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,430
Good to see you too. We'll see you soon.

28
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,421
Hey, you.

29
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,809
Okay, so...

30
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,651
who won?

31
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,054
John. But he cheats.

32
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:20,530
What? It was two against one.
I had to do something, right?

33
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,019
Yeah, right.

34
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,687
What?

35
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,489
Where did Sharon get off to?

36
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,442
- Oh, I'll find her.
- Thanks.

37
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,959
Bye.

38
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,767
Pete send you after me?

39
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,237
I swear, one day he thinks I'll just...

40
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,524
run off too.

41
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,491
Men.

42
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,491
What would they do without us?
I mean, honestly.

43
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,722
Hey, wait a second. Let me help you out.

44
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,381
- We appreciate the lift, Pete.
- Sure thing.

45
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,634
You just make sure to take care
of this wife and baby of yours.

46
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,177
Did we ask about names yet?

47
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,012
- Sharon.
- What? It's not prying.

48
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,223
- I don't know her.
- It's just conversation.

49
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,768
- We're still working on them anyway.
- But we're pretty sure "John" if it's a boy.

50
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,354
- And we're thinking "Phyllis" if it's a girl.
- We were?

51
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,658
- Yeah. You said you liked it.
- I never said that.

52
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,985
- It's my grandmother's name.
- And I can't stand your grandmother.

53
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,404
Oh, dear.

54
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,781
I mean, it's not only me.
Nobody can stand her.

55
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,854
No, she's right, everyone hates her.

56
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,202
Okay, well, on that note...

57
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,722
Sharon, let's go inside. These two,
they have a lot to talk about.

58
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:07,582
Thank you again.

59
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,917
Think nothing of it.

60
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,514
Just remember:

61
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,587
Children are a blessing.

62
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,005
Indeed they are.

63
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,799
And then they learn to talk.

64
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,521
Oh, you.

65
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,568
Bye.

66
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,223
I guess that's a "no" on Phyllis?

67
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:28,278
We shouldn't talk about the
baby so much in front of them.

68
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:31,288
- I just think it isn't right.
- Why not?

69
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,701
Well, they only lost their
daughter two years ago.

70
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,737
They didn't lose their daughter, Mia.

71
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,905
She ran away and joined up
with the hippies.

72
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,117
By now she's probably got three
husbands and calls herself "Star."

73
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:47,469
Well, even "Star" is a
better name than Phyllis.

74
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,376
Oh, you didn't lock it?

75
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,128
No. Why would I?

76
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,932
You have to start locking it, John.
I mean, it's a different world now.

77
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,678
They call themselves "The Family."

78
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,848
But police officials have
labeled them a dangerous cult.

79
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,476
Residing on the grounds
of Spahn Ranch...

80
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,604
once used as the backdrop for
many well-known Westerns...

81
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,078
the Family is estimated to
have close to 30 members...

82
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:18,462
many of them with histories of heavy
drug use and criminal behavior.

83
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,281
Currently, several Family
members are in custody...

84
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,202
awaiting charges for the brutal
Tate and LaBianca murders...

85
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,121
which held Los Angeles
in the grip of fear...

86
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,041
before police investigators
were led to the suspects...

87
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,209
Hey, honey?

88
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:36,296
Do you think you could shut off the TV?
It's making it a little hard to concentrate.

89
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,466
Their leader, Charles Manson,
was sometimes referred to...

90
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,803
as both "God" and "Satan"
by his devoted followers...

91
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:47,700
and had predicted an Armageddon-like
event he called Helter Skelter.

92
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,701
Thank you.

93
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,193
Hey. You know what, you shouldn't
even be watching that stuff. All right?

94
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,612
It could upset the baby.
There's new research out there...

95
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,114
- Oh, boy, more new research?
- It's true.

96
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,200
They are learning that
babies in utero...

97
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,703
experience more of the outside world
than they ever thought possible.

98
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,373
They recognize voices and noises, songs.

99
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,669
You know, I bet the men that did that
research spent millions of dollars...

100
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,722
when they could have just
asked the mother for free.

101
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,592
How's it going in here?

102
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,444
Well...

103
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,065
I am trying my hardest to enjoy it.

104
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,425
Everyone keeps telling me that...

105
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:34,604
once you're in the residency
it gets a million times worse.

106
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,440
I haven't even mentioned the fact
that I'm about to be a new father.

107
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,162
Why not?

108
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,861
I don't know.

109
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:45,031
Sometimes you just don't wanna
hear how difficult it's gonna be.

110
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,708
"Difficult"?

111
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,911
No, maybe difficult's
not the right word.

112
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,589
Challenging?

113
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:01,599
Are you talking about the residency,
or me and the baby?

114
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,884
I don't know.

115
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,802
All of it, I guess.

116
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,982
I mean, it's not like this is an ideal
situation for what I'm about to go through.

117
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,282
Like what we're about to go through.

118
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,723
I didn't mean for that to
sound like it did. I'm sorry.

119
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:41,264
It's not like difficult or
challenging are bad things, anyway.

120
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:47,218
Look, I know that I've been a little
caught up in my own world lately.

121
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,180
- Some people might call it self-centered.
- "Some people"?

122
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,527
Most people?

123
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,283
Everyone?

124
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,454
Can we just go back and redo
the last two minutes, please?

125
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,496
Please?

126
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,837
It's fine.

127
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,669
I know you're stressed.

128
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,666
I'm just a little, oversensitive lately.

129
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,092
Yeah.

130
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,338
- Do you want me to tell you why?
- Yes, doctor.

131
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,881
Okay, well, good. So...

132
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,718
In my, almost expert opinion...

133
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,804
you are a little sensitive...

134
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,527
because you are a lot pregnant.

135
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,395
Honey, I'm sorry, Mia. I am.

136
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,940
Yes. I'm stressed about
finishing med school...

137
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,359
and I'm freaking out about matching...

138
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,332
but I've never been happier.

139
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,750
Ever.

140
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,175
Okay? And that's because of you.

141
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,472
And it.

142
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,387
Oh, you know what?

143
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,393
There's something I wanna give you.

144
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,592
Oh, no. The last time you said
that I ended up pregnant.

145
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,314
Yes, you did.

146
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,995
Okay, close your eyes.

147
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,618
All right. Hold on a second. I was
waiting on this until the baby, but...

148
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,328
You were feeling a little...

149
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,372
Guilty, yes. Because of what I said.

150
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,424
Okay. Open your eyes.

151
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,763
You didn't.

152
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,646
Oh, my God, John.

153
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,119
- That's the one, right?
- Yes.

154
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,780
Where did you find her? I mean,
do you know how long I've been looking?

155
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,573
I know.

156
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,825
I'd completely lost hope.

157
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,798
Well, I have my ways.

158
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,478
We'll be a little short on the rent
the next few months, but...

159
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,730
There. She fits right in.

160
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,998
That completes the set, right?

161
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,076
Yes, it does.

162
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,708
Thank you. I love her.

163
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,987
John?

164
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,910
John, wake up.

165
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,354
- What is it? Is it the baby?
- No, no.

166
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,523
Next door, I heard a scream.

167
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,246
I think something's wrong.

168
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,973
Stay here. I'll go check it out.

169
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,514
John, wait!

170
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,670
Shouldn't we call the cops?

171
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,505
Because you think you heard a scream?

172
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,383
No, just let me go check it out.
They'd do the same for us.

173
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,053
If they heard me scream,
I'd rather they call the cops.

174
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,276
Think they heard you scream.

175
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,900
- Just be careful.
- I will.

176
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,035
John?

177
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,003
- Oh, my God! You're covered in blood.
- It's not mine.

178
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,182
Go back inside and call
an ambulance, right now. Go!

179
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,905
911 operator.

180
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,866
I need an ambulance.

181
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,713
What's your location?

182
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,953
307 Gardner Road.

183
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,288
In Santa Monica?

184
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,497
Yeah.

185
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,174
What's your emergency?

186
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,209
I don't know, but...

187
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,391
There's a lot of blood.

188
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,725
Please, just be as fast as possible.

189
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,556
I like your dolls.

190
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,646
My husband's coming back.

191
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:25,568
Just take whatever you
want and just get out!

192
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,557
Mia!

193
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,907
Get out of here!

194
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,994
Get out! Get out of here, Mia!

195
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,054
Open up!

196
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,669
- Open the door!
- I got you.

197
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,629
- Open up, this is the police.
- I got you.

198
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,226
Open the door!

199
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,479
You just breathe.

200
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,148
You're all right. We got you.

201
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,576
I'm right here. I'm right here with you.

202
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,608
In a tragic scene described
by one investigator...

203
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,944
as reminiscent of a
horrific occult ritual...

204
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,947
a man and his wife were
brutally stabbed to death...

205
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:55,076
by their estranged daughter, Annabelle
Higgins, and her unidentified boyfriend.

206
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,286
The two are believed to
be members of a cult.

207
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:01,332
The male suspect was shot and killed
as police arrived on scene...

208
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:05,878
while the daughter was found in an
apparent suicide, her throat slit open.

209
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,549
One officer summed up these
blood-soaked murders by saying:

210
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,945
"In all my years, I have never seen
anything quite as gruesome as this."

211
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:21,852
And while the amniotic
sac wasn't punctured...

212
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,105
and isn't ruptured...

213
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:29,662
we are seeing signs of
strain on the cervix.

214
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,572
Most likely caused by the trauma.

215
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,490
Which is why...

216
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,387
I am putting you on bed rest for
the remainder of your pregnancy.

217
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:43,624
Now, you can get up
and use the facilities...

218
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,268
if you do so delicately.

219
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,674
But anything beyond that would be putting
you and your child at risk. All right?

220
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,818
- Yes, sir. Thank you.
- Okay.

221
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,499
The lock.

222
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,307
I had them scrub everything.
At least twice.

223
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,477
Now you could perform surgery
in there, it's so clean.

224
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,117
You didn't have to do that.

225
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,874
You're on bed rest for a while.
You'd go crazy if I didn't.

226
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:59,075
Just don't get all obsessed
with those daytime soaps.

227
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,548
You know I can't stand them.

228
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,746
I'll bring your sewing bag in later on.

229
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:08,017
Okay? We can turn the whole room
into your own little sweatshop.

230
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,645
What is it?

231
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,234
You think the baby's okay?

232
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:21,055
The baby is not even
aware of what happened.

233
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:24,684
Oh, really? Because I heard there's
some new research that, you know...

234
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,611
Mia, come on.

235
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,813
You heard the doctors.

236
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,232
So if you listen to them,
the baby is fine.

237
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,775
The baby is fine.

238
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,819
I mean, you're its mother, right?

239
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,087
If it wasn't, you would know.

240
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,784
But if something does happen...

241
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,661
What? What's gonna happen?

242
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,080
Like when I go into labor, John.

243
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,848
Mia.

244
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,803
You'll save the baby over me.

245
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,765
- Come on.
- We have to talk about it.

246
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,945
I mean, I can't have
anything ever happen to it.

247
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,198
You promise me.

248
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,537
You promise me you'll save the baby.

249
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,085
Yeah, Mia, I promise.

250
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,862
But you know what?

251
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,363
It's gonna be okay.

252
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,711
You are gonna be fine.

253
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,752
What the hell is that?

254
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,388
John?

255
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,578
- John?
- It's okay.

256
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,383
I'm your friend,
you know that, don't you?

257
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,382
Are you, Phil?

258
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,387
Of course I am.

259
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,559
Well, then, I have a friend.

260
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,009
You have been terribly nice this
past week. Going to the movie...

261
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,108
Out to dinner. Even dancing.

262
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,735
It's been a lot of fun for me.

263
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,151
How'd it go today?

264
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,028
- TV went out again.
- Really?

265
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:31,002
Must be that room.
That never did that in the den.

266
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,450
What is all that?

267
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,329
This is a bunch of random stuff
that I picked up at the store...

268
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,540
to satisfy any pregnancy cravings.

269
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,043
You know, it's funny, I haven't
really had any cravings. It's funny.

270
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,396
Pickles.

271
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,008
Oh, my God, you know what
would go really well with pickles?

272
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,359
John Form, we are meant to be together.

273
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,265
Yeah, I know.

274
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,518
Like, mustard and pickles.

275
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,065
Did you get to have your meeting today?

276
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,567
Yeah, I did.

277
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:10,246
He, thinks I've got a real
shot at Huntington Memorial.

278
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,323
Of course you do.

279
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:17,469
It's in Pasadena, though. It's a little
further from the beach. You okay with that?

280
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,590
Change of view would be good.

281
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,126
Yeah.

282
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:27,838
There's this one day conference in
Sacramento that he thinks I should attend...

283
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,391
that, could help move
things in that direction.

284
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,149
I fly out for a day in a few days.

285
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,314
It's only a couple days.

286
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,233
I'll be fine.

287
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,977
Yeah, we gotta get you back to bed.

288
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,229
You shouldn't be sitting up this long.

289
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,576
Let's go.

290
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,775
Oh, and, Detective Clarkin called today.

291
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,486
He said he wanted to stop
by at some point this week.

292
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:54,364
I've already told him everything.
I'd rather just forget the whole thing.

293
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,167
I know. He just said he wanted
to go over a few things.

294
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,763
That doll.

295
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:06,335
We have to get rid of it.
I mean, she had it in her hands.

296
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:10,672
No, you're right. You're right.
Just, consider it gone.

297
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,676
I suppose you can tell Detective Clarkin
he can stop by whenever it's convenient.

298
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:19,277
I mean, it's not like I'm going
anywhere anytime soon.

299
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,516
They were members of a cult.

300
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:00,948
We've confirmed that it was Higgins'
daughter and her boyfriend.

301
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:05,227
- You may have heard on the news...
- That cults are taking over the world?

302
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,522
Well, it's not quite as prevalent
as they'd have you believe.

303
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,621
You're gonna have a hard
time convincing us of that.

304
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,210
Were they satanic?

305
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,995
It's okay. She should know.

306
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,788
Yes.

307
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:28,876
Yes, it is believed that they
had interest in the occult.

308
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,211
That they did this to
prove their devotion...

309
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,797
a sort of violence for violence's sake.

310
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,725
But that's crazy.

311
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,400
Well, crazy people do
crazy things, ma'am.

312
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,487
But that's all this was.

313
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,991
I'll tell you what.

314
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,773
I'll dig a little deeper.

315
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,609
See what I can find.

316
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,737
And if I come up with anything further,
I'll reach out and I'll let you...

317
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,630
No, no.

318
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,632
Thank you.

319
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:05,049
But, unless it has something
to do with our safety...

320
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,591
I'd rather not hear any more about it.

321
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:10,884
Okay.

322
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,678
I understand.

323
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,800
Okay. Good.

324
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,272
Right there.

325
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,650
Thank you.

326
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,973
I'm making popcorn.

327
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,992
- Tim Conway's here.
- And John Wayne.

328
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,396
He backed out again?!

329
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,826
Are you sure it's okay for the baby
to have this much butter and s...

330
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,996
- Raquel Welch and Sophia Loren.
- Now, you know they're not here.

331
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,666
- Well, where are they?
- I don't know where they are.

332
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,343
Let's get them on!

333
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,355
- How you feeling?
- A little nervous.

334
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,612
They are gonna love you.

335
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,913
I love you.

336
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,865
I love you too.

337
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:30,722
I realize, Miss Prentice, but you still
have time. Mind if I look around?

338
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,947
But wouldn't you be more
comfortable sitting down?

339
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,363
I do know how painful
this must be for you.

340
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,381
Look, it had absolutely
nothing to do with the money!

341
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,050
Look, I don't even want to talk about it.
I don't wanna think about it. I...

342
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,461
Why don't you just leave now.

343
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,671
What if they're not dead?
What'll you do then?

344
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,770
I told you, I don't know!
Would you please leave?!

345
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,359
Help me!

346
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,016
I got you. I got you.
It's okay. Come here.

347
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,277
Excuse me.

348
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,455
Hey. Hey.

349
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,414
Hi.

350
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,151
Hi.

351
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:08,071
I'm so sorry that I wasn't here.
I am so sorry.

352
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,839
Behind you.

353
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,510
Congratulations.

354
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,637
- It's a girl.
- This is my baby.

355
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,095
Oh, my gosh.

356
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,275
Leah?

357
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,070
Leah. Hi.

358
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,902
Hi, Leah, it's your daddy.

359
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,527
Look at her.

360
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,738
Look at her.

361
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,289
Hi.

362
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,951
- John...
- Yeah?

363
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,778
John, the fire...

364
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,740
It's fine. She's fine. You're fine.

365
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,417
No.

366
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,835
I don't know what happened.

367
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:59,089
It's like the house is accursed.

368
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:04,303
I can never go back there.
I can't. I can't, not with her. No.

369
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,013
You don't have to.

370
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,556
Ever.

371
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,394
Come on, come on.

372
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,029
Hey, honey, you all set?

373
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,282
Any second now...

374
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,325
she is gonna...

375
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,830
And then...

376
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,348
You need to get out more.
Come on, we'll be late.

377
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,548
You really think we should go?
I mean, Leah's being a little fussy.

378
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:34,593
Mia, she's fine. Okay?
You both need to get out of here.

379
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,804
- You've been cooped up in here too much.
- I know, but it's...

380
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,347
Look at it out here.

381
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,557
It's beautiful.

382
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:44,853
Okay? Come on, you need this. I need this.
Leah, she could definitely use some color.

383
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,646
Stop it! She's perfect.

384
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:50,025
Maybe we could put some of that, what do
you call it, what do you use these...?

385
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,902
Oh, cocoa butter. Maybe we should
slather her with some cocoa butter.

386
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,070
Okay, okay.

387
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,949
I will go as long as you stop talking.

388
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,922
I promise.

389
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,383
- Let's go.
- Come on.

390
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,382
We're going.

391
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:18,194
We cannot let fear control us.

392
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,056
For we are never truly alone...

393
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,903
when we walk with God.

394
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:28,789
Isn't it true that the more we know about
something the less fear we have from it?

395
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:34,036
We need to face our fears
to better understand them.

396
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,284
We need to shine a bright light...

397
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:45,205
on the monsters that feed
on our insecurities...

398
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,165
on our anxieties...

399
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,934
and on the doubt we cast on ourselves.

400
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:54,102
We need to remember that,
for those who have faith...

401
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,601
this light of truth is everlasting.

402
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:04,015
Mia. Mind if I take a
picture of your little one?

403
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,104
I like to hang photos of the
newest members of the congregation

404
00:38:07,205 --> 00:38:11,189
- on the visitors' bulletin board.
- Yes. Sure, of course.

405
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,617
No, no, no. Hold her on your lap.

406
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,165
Oh, you don't need me in the photo.

407
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,583
Of course I do.

408
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,628
Mothers are closer to God
than any other living creature.

409
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:24,511
For only they can share
in God's creative miracle.

410
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,788
Leah.

411
00:38:29,715 --> 00:38:31,288
Leah!

412
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,183
Wonderful. That should do it.

413
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:40,526
I still feel the Higgins'
absence every Sunday.

414
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,650
- I imagine it must be difficult for you...
- Oh, there's John. I should go.

415
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,323
We still have a lot of boxes to unpack.

416
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,998
Well, unfortunately, I don't have
a prayer to help you with that.

417
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:58,374
Well, I guess there are some things
we need to take care of ourselves.

418
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,749
Yes. Goodbye.

419
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,512
Father Perez.

420
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,658
I think this is the last of them.

421
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,991
Somebody pop the champagne.

422
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,042
I'll get her.

423
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,772
Wait a sec, how did that get in there?
I swear I threw it out.

424
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,699
I don't know.

425
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,245
Things must have gotten
mixed up after the fire.

426
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,584
Here, give her to me.

427
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,375
No.

428
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,003
You gave her to me as a gift.

429
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:34,470
Like Father Perez said, we should
celebrate our strength, right?

430
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,001
You sure?

431
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,769
Yeah.

432
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,931
Yeah.

433
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,657
There. She fits right in.

434
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:05,864
Come to Mommy! Come to Mommy!

435
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,077
Where doctors and nurses
dedicate their lives...

436
00:41:29,178 --> 00:41:32,044
to that wonder which is a human being.

437
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:16,976
...an ever-changing challenge of love
and hope, loneliness and despair.

438
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,904
General Hospital on ABC.

439
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:26,582
Doctors and nurses with first names and
last names, and tragedies of their own.

440
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,703
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Excuse me.

441
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,552
Oh, sorry. Thank you.

442
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,894
Hi!

443
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,546
Do you live here too?

444
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,800
- We live ups...
- Don't tell her.

445
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,695
We're not supposed to tell.
She's a stranger.

446
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,848
That's a very good rule to have.

447
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,767
I like your doll.

448
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,602
I have one just like it.

449
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,145
You do?

450
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,288
A few, actually.

451
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:07,289
I'm Mia and this is Leah.

452
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,446
Yeah.

453
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,872
What's your name?

454
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:17,049
- It's Nan...
- I said, don't tell her.

455
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:24,511
Well, maybe one day,
we can all be friends.

456
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:11,758
Hey. You're the new tenants
at the Palmeri, aren't you?

457
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,301
Yes.

458
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:17,013
I suppose this little one is
pretty much new to everything.

459
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,765
This is Leah.

460
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,692
She's adorable.

461
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,643
I'm Mia.

462
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,479
Evelyn, hi.

463
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,648
Here. This was my daughter's favorite.

464
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,669
Maybe Leah will like it too,
when she's a little older.

465
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,422
That's very sweet. Thank you.

466
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,576
Well, feel free to stop by anytime.

467
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,253
Thank you.

468
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,356
Hey.

469
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,813
Look what they drew for you.

470
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:09,190
See! That's us.

471
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,958
We're making friends already.

472
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,498
Yeah.

473
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,124
At least we're getting
a little exercise.

474
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,464
Look at this.

475
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,137
Should we, talk to their parents?

476
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,340
If Leah did something like this,
I would want to know about it.

477
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,450
Leah would never do anything
like this. This isn't even good.

478
00:46:18,551 --> 00:46:21,187
- Look at the proportions.
- John.

479
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,848
Yes, Mia, if she did,
I would want to know too.

480
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:27,810
Okay, so let's go find out where
they live, introduce ourselves.

481
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,946
But let's not make a big
deal out of this, okay?

482
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,502
It's not like this is a threat
or anything. This is just...

483
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:36,944
- one kid with an overactive imagination.
- I know. I know, I know.

484
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,907
You gotta remember that we moved
here to get away from what happened.

485
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:45,828
We packed up our clothes, we packed up our
furniture. We packed up the good memories.

486
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:49,582
But the fears and the anxieties,
we promised to leave those behind.

487
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:52,510
It is not as easy as it sounds, John.

488
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,964
You're off at work, having adult
conversation, and I'm here...

489
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,517
Working yourself up over nothing.

490
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:09,235
Look, I'm sorry.
Look, okay, you know what?

491
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,147
Tomorrow night,
I don't have to work late.

492
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:17,122
Okay, so I say I come home,
we sit down...

493
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,986
we have a nice dinner...

494
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,506
and we have some adult conversation.

495
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,710
Okay? Can we do that?

496
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,043
Hello?

497
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,234
Who are you?

498
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:21,961
There isn't anyone here.

499
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,671
It's just you, me and Leah.

500
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:27,475
- I know what I saw. It was her.
- Mia...

501
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:31,262
There are things happening
that I can't explain, John.

502
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:32,513
What things?

503
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:36,684
Baby, are you sure they're not just
manifestations of your anxiety?

504
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:40,187
It's perfectly normal for new
mothers to experience postpartum...

505
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:44,537
You know that being a doctor doesn't
make you an expert on everything, right?

506
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:57,255
I think we should talk to someone.

507
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,725
Like who?

508
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,344
A shrink?

509
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,718
I'm not crazy, John.
I'm not crazy, John.

510
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:14,693
I'm not saying that you're crazy, okay.
And I'm not talking about a shrink.

511
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,448
So we turned to the Church, Father.

512
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:24,648
It's what my parents did when
they hit a rough patch...

513
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,416
and it worked for them.

514
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:29,082
I understand, of course.

515
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:33,866
But you two hit more
than just a rough patch.

516
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:38,763
In a matter of months,
you've experienced the very worst of life.

517
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:41,136
And the very best.

518
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:47,004
A pendulum swing like that is enough to
shake even the strongest foundations.

519
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,681
But you survived.

520
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:52,760
And instead of trying to
forget this bad history...

521
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:58,237
I think you should use it as an example
of how strong you two can be when united.

522
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,369
You don't come out the other side
of something like this weaker.

523
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,780
You come out stronger.

524
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,207
You're right.

525
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:16,717
Good.

526
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,666
- Hey!
- Oh, hi.

527
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,376
- Mia, right?
- Yes.

528
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:29,463
And, of course, I remember Leah.
You are...?

529
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,006
- Hi. John.
- Hi.

530
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,634
This is Evelyn. She owns the
bookstore I was telling you about.

531
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:37,304
- Right. Yeah. Thank you for the book.
- I couldn't help myself.

532
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:42,531
I saw your girls and I felt like
I had known them a long time.

533
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,896
So where is this
beautiful family off to?

534
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,190
- We're just seeing him out.
- I have to get to the hospital.

535
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,485
- They put me on the night shift.
- I think he did something terrible.

536
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,112
They say that I'm being rewarded.

537
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:58,492
Well, if you guys ever want a tour of the
neighborhood, don't hesitate to call me.

538
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,743
Thank you.

539
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,636
- Blessed day.
- Bye.

540
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,124
I should probably go too. Go to Mommy?

541
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:06,333
Come on!

542
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,939
Come on! Come on!

543
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,475
Leah!

544
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,940
Leah!

545
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,256
Help me!

546
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,717
Help me!

547
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,416
I'm sorry.

548
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,051
Thank you.

549
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,580
Thank you for meeting with me.

550
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,040
It's fine.

551
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:05,752
I was a little surprised to hear from you,
though. Last time we spoke...

552
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,054
I said I didn't want to know any more.

553
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:12,059
Having had a little distance I am...

554
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:15,570
Well, I realized I could
use some closure.

555
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:18,765
I mean, there're just too
many unanswered questions.

556
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,442
I understand.

557
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:23,946
I brought what I have
on the Higgins case.

558
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:32,914
That's Annabelle there.
The Higgins girl.

559
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:37,676
That was, clearly, taken before
she got caught up in the cult.

560
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:42,218
Looks a lot different than the last
time you saw her, doesn't she?

561
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,140
This cult that she was in...

562
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,264
did you look further into it?

563
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:52,716
For what, specifically?

564
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:56,395
I don't know, there must have
been some motive for their attacks.

565
01:00:57,279 --> 01:01:00,858
- Crazy people do crazy things.
- Crazy things. I know.

566
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:04,153
They didn't think they were crazy.

567
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:07,034
They had to have had a reason.

568
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:12,903
After a little more digging, I did
find that their act wasn't devotional.

569
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:17,629
That they were actually trying
to conjure something up.

570
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,787
Like what?

571
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:24,039
The Devil? Demons?

572
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,958
The Tooth Fairy.
I don't know specifically.

573
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,556
- It doesn't really matter anywa...
- Why not?

574
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,048
Well, because this is all
just a bunch of hocus-pocus.

575
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,527
Please.

576
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,071
Ma'am...

577
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:51,283
these were miscreants.

578
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,569
They were probably hopped up
on God knows what...

579
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:58,294
and it made them see
and do all sorts of...

580
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,092
terrible things.

581
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,308
Does this mean anything to you?

582
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,527
Have you ever heard the expression:

583
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,221
"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar"?

584
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:25,901
Then you won't mind if I,
keep this one for myself.

585
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:31,448
And one more thing.
Does the cult have a name?

586
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:41,549
They called themselves
"The Disciples of the Ram."

587
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,728
Hello again.

588
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,640
Is there anything I can help you with?

589
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,945
Oh, no, no, no.
I was just browsing, really.

590
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,239
I just learned something.

591
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:15,158
You're a terrible liar.

592
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,837
Now, what is it you're looking for?

593
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,450
- Maybe I'll come back.
- Mia.

594
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,035
I'm old.

595
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:28,009
Which means there's very little
that surprises me anymore.

596
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,424
And if it does,
I'm too tired to show it.

597
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,952
Now, you gonna tell me? Or we just...

598
01:03:34,053 --> 01:03:37,623
I think my family's being
haunted by a ghost.

599
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:41,852
Aisle four. Follow me.

600
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:51,061
I know it sounds crazy, the ghost
of this girl haunting us, but I just...

601
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:54,064
No crazier than the Red Sea parting.

602
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,274
To nonbelievers, it's all crazy.

603
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:57,951
So you believe in this stuff?

604
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:03,615
Let's just say that I've had one
or two experiences in my life...

605
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:07,590
that have helped me
to keep an open mind.

606
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:20,106
I don't particularly think what you're
experiencing is the ghost of that girl.

607
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,092
Why not?

608
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,511
Well, ghosts haunt specific places.

609
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:27,514
Usually where something
terrible has happened.

610
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:29,566
Like your old house.

611
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:33,186
But we moved and it's still happening.

612
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,563
Which is why I don't think it's a ghost.

613
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,649
But now, that cult?

614
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:41,328
You said that they were
trying to summon something.

615
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,905
From what I've read in the past...

616
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:47,334
these cults, they don't summon ghosts.

617
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:50,095
They summon inhuman spirits.

618
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,840
Something that's never
existed in the flesh.

619
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,221
Demons.

620
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,970
What do they want?

621
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,765
A soul.

622
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:05,276
And they won't stop until they get one.

623
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,567
What do I do?

624
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:13,451
Hopefully, the answer
is in one of these books.

625
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,844
My daughter, Ruby.

626
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,890
She passed away when
she was about your age.

627
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,469
I'm sorry.

628
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:45,734
Without her, I felt like I had
nothing else to live for, so...

629
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:50,480
But as I lay there,
waiting for it all to end...

630
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:54,193
I heard her voice.

631
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:58,355
She told me that it wasn't my time.

632
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:01,534
That God had another purpose for me.

633
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,028
You, too, have a purpose, Mia.

634
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,947
To protect your family.

635
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,450
So don't think you're crazy
for trying to do that.

636
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:13,344
You do what you think is right.

637
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,264
You do what you have to do.

638
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,989
Mia.

639
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:11,094
"The Devil preys on the
weak and the vulnerable.

640
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:21,492
Seeking to devour their souls...

641
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,868
To perform incantations...

642
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:29,454
Spilling the blood of kin.

643
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:33,508
Spilling the blood of an innocent."

644
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,097
But how do I stop it?

645
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:51,525
Hey.

646
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:53,436
Hey.

647
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,704
Leah.

648
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,338
Leah!

649
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,593
Leah!

650
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,261
Leah!

651
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,449
Leah!

652
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,731
Oh, my God!

653
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:17,997
What happened?

654
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:22,795
Help us. You gotta help us, John.

655
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:46,321
- Thank you for coming, Father.
- Sure, of course.

656
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:50,955
I'll take your coat.

657
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,293
Mia...

658
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,153
this doll...

659
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,000
may I see it?

660
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:38,361
- John got rid of her.
- Or tried to.

661
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:41,072
There she was, at the bottom
of one of our last boxes.

662
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:45,297
I still don't understand what the doll
has to do with this supposed demon.

663
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:51,124
Demons can sometimes use objects as
conduits to achieve their desired goal.

664
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:53,051
"Their desired goal"?

665
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,644
Our souls, John.

666
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,143
That's why it's after Leah.

667
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,564
- It wants her soul.
- No, no, no.

668
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,154
Demons can't just take souls, Mia.

669
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:09,267
A soul needs to be offered to
the demon before it can take it.

670
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:12,366
Well, I don't plan on offering
my soul anytime soon.

671
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,231
The Devil is the father of lies.

672
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,817
Demons are his manipulators.

673
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:20,211
No one ever plans to offer their soul.

674
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,376
How do we get rid of it?

675
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:26,967
- How do we stop it from coming back?
- I don't know.

676
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,007
Not yet.

677
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,497
But someone at the church might.

678
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,753
At the very least,
I've heard of a married couple...

679
01:12:33,854 --> 01:12:38,171
that the church has worked with in the
past that deal with this type of thing.

680
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,798
They're back East,
but a call can always be placed.

681
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,771
What do we do in the meantime?

682
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:46,479
I can't have Leah
anywhere near that doll.

683
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:50,198
Let me take her.

684
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,603
Perhaps, if she's stored
in a sacred place...

685
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:57,624
it will weaken the demon enough,
it won't have the strength to return.

686
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:01,986
Thank you, Father.

687
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:03,788
Of course.

688
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,672
Come on, let's get you to bed.
Doctor's orders.

689
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:06,259
Oh, no. No, John. I can't.
Not until I know it's not coming back.

690
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:08,469
Mia. Come on, what if...

691
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:10,137
- What if I...
- John, I can't.

692
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:11,722
What if I just stayed up with her?

693
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:13,490
You get some rest.

694
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:17,073
- All right?
- Okay.

695
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,272
Good night.

696
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:20,824
John.

697
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:24,652
Yeah?

698
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:26,579
Thank you for believing me.

699
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:29,965
I didn't know if you would.

700
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:33,286
Mia, come on.

701
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:34,912
I love you.

702
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:37,260
I will always believe you.

703
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:42,394
Good night.

704
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,849
You think Father Perez can help us?

705
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,901
Yeah, I do.

706
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:56,571
The count is 2-and-1 on the 74th pitch.

707
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:59,145
Away there, and a beautiful
sinker right in the box.

708
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:02,481
Logonov swinging. Strike,
to bring the count to 2-and-2.

709
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:03,733
Now...

710
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,842
And the windup.

711
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:17,671
Come on.

712
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:21,459
May God have mercy on your soul!

713
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,117
Frankly, Mia...

714
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:20,715
it's none of your business.

715
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:22,955
This is between me and Leah...

716
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:26,625
and she said she wanted those pajamas.

717
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,269
You are going to spoil her.

718
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:33,353
I haven't had a chance for grandkids.
And besides,

719
01:17:33,454 --> 01:17:37,636
- it's impossible to spoil a baby.
- Oh, I don't know if that is true.

720
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:40,916
Well, we'll certainly find
out with Leah because...

721
01:17:41,017 --> 01:17:44,701
- she also pointed out these dresses.
- Oh, Evelyn.

722
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:14,173
Oh, sweetie pie, goodness gracious.

723
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,633
Oh, Mommy.

724
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:20,279
Okay. You know what, my Ruby used
to fuss and fuss until I rocked her.

725
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:22,148
Put her down here.

726
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:25,738
She used to fuss and fuss. Come on.

727
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:30,815
Come here, honey. Alrighty. Okay.
Here we go. Here we go, Leah.

728
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:37,501
We're gonna rock
that baby all night long

729
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:44,424
You are a lifesaver.

730
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:48,057
What was it that you were humming?

731
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:50,167
An old blues ditty.

732
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:55,018
It was the only thing that would settle
my Ruby down when she was a baby.

733
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:02,023
Do you mind if I ask how she passed?
I don't mind if...

734
01:19:02,124 --> 01:19:05,751
- If you don't wanna talk about it, it's fine.
- No. No, it's okay.

735
01:19:05,852 --> 01:19:08,281
It was a car accident.

736
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,565
We were driving back from my parents'.

737
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:14,358
They live up north.

738
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:18,379
So, I was tired, you know.

739
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,627
Family will do that to you.

740
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:26,466
And it was very late and I shouldn't
have been behind the wheel.

741
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:32,042
Last thing I remember was...

742
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:35,421
looking over in the passenger seat...

743
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:39,271
at my daughter asleep.

744
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,690
Mia, she had grown into the
most beautiful young woman.

745
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,897
I woke up three weeks later...

746
01:19:52,997 --> 01:19:55,074
and Ruby never did.

747
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,791
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

748
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:04,083
I didn't get to beg
God to take me first.

749
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,672
I made the mistake...

750
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:14,097
and she paid the price.

751
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,303
Father.

752
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,139
Where is it?

753
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:55,760
- Where's what?
- The doll.

754
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:57,970
You took it with you.

755
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,851
The evil.

756
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,720
Its presence.

757
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,068
I saw it, John.

758
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:11,488
I felt it.

759
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:14,361
I felt how much it wants.

760
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:16,605
Wants what?

761
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:19,525
To take her soul.

762
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:23,070
But you said that it can't take Leah's.
You said that it has to be offered.

763
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:24,622
Yes.

764
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:28,334
And a baby cannot offer its soul.

765
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:33,510
Oh, my God. Mia.

766
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:45,859
Here, I'll get her.

767
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:50,231
- Hello?
- Mia.

768
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,516
Father Perez was in
an accident. He said...

769
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:00,834
- John?
- Mia, I need you to get out of the house.

770
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,457
...there. I am leaving now!

771
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:30,146
Father Perez?

772
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:38,411
Is everything all right?

773
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:44,292
Father?

774
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:51,463
May God have mercy on your soul!

775
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:56,175
Who is that?

776
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:11,261
We need to leave.

777
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:15,358
Leah. Leah!

778
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:19,448
Leah!

779
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,337
Leah! Leah!

780
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,211
Leah!

781
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:39,164
Mia, the phone is dead. Come on.

782
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,208
- Oh, my God, it has my baby.
- We'll use the one in my apartment.

783
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:43,627
- You need to come with me.
- No, I need to find Leah.

784
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:47,339
We'll get her back. We need to get
to church, they'll help us. Come!

785
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:12,448
Evelyn!

786
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:28,062
Leah!

787
01:24:30,691 --> 01:24:32,063
Leah!

788
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,238
Leah!

789
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:49,743
Leah!

790
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:58,243
What do you want from me?

791
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,420
What do you want from me?!

792
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:00,279
You give her back to me!

793
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:05,493
You give her back! Where is she?!

794
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:21,968
Oh, God.

795
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:23,716
Leah!

796
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,465
Leah!

797
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:28,637
Leah!

798
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:31,837
Leah!

799
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:34,893
No!

800
01:26:37,984 --> 01:26:40,312
No! My baby!

801
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:43,861
Please, God, no!

802
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:49,700
Leah, Leah, Leah. Please, no.

803
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,343
Help! Please!

804
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:09,007
Where is she?!

805
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:12,098
There has to be another way!

806
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:28,952
Your soul.

807
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:33,164
Your soul.

808
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,785
Your soul.

809
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:38,836
Your soul.

810
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:55,645
It's okay.

811
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:15,328
Mommy's coming to save you, Leah.
Mommy's coming.

812
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:19,335
Mia!

813
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:26,793
Mia!

814
01:28:35,852 --> 01:28:37,679
Mia!

815
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,144
Mia!

816
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,943
Mommy's coming.

817
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:02,946
- Mia!
- Hey!

818
01:29:03,046 --> 01:29:05,874
- They're in there, I can't get in.
- Mia. Mia!

819
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:10,720
Mia!

820
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:16,350
Mia, no!

821
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:18,670
Stop! Stop!

822
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:20,839
Stop! Stop. Stop.

823
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:22,883
Okay, look, listen to me.

824
01:29:22,983 --> 01:29:24,560
Please, come down.

825
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:27,304
It took my baby.

826
01:29:27,404 --> 01:29:30,599
Please, you gotta come down.
Please come down. Okay?

827
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:33,435
It wants her soul.
I have to give it mine, John.

828
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:35,612
Mia, no! Don't do it.

829
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:37,814
It won't give her back unless I...

830
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:41,943
No, Mia, listen to me.
Leah needs you here. Okay, sweetie?

831
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,211
I need you here. Please, don't do this.

832
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:47,924
I love you, John.

833
01:29:48,425 --> 01:29:49,877
I love you.

834
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:52,841
I know you'll take
good care of our Leah.

835
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:55,598
You kiss her every night.

836
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:57,375
- When she's older...
- Don't. Please.

837
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:59,598
You tell her that I loved her.

838
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:01,855
No! No!

839
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:04,019
No! No!

840
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,343
- John, no!
- Stop. Stop.

841
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:08,845
- It wants her soul!
- Stop. You do not have to give in to it.

842
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:10,347
My baby!

843
01:30:10,447 --> 01:30:12,182
- We can figure this out.
- No!

844
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:13,975
Mia, listen to him.

845
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:15,993
You can't do this to Leah.

846
01:30:16,286 --> 01:30:18,313
A daughter needs her mother.

847
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:20,690
You said it needed a soul!

848
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:21,900
Please...

849
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,819
- Let me save her.
- Think about this.

850
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:27,113
Listen. You don't wanna do this.
Okay, listen to me. No, stop, stop.

851
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:30,075
You said you'd save her.
You said you'd save her over me!

852
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:33,370
- You promised! Please.
- Think about our baby. Think about Leah.

853
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:35,080
Okay? Think about her.

854
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,832
Please, don't do this to us.

855
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:39,726
- It wants her soul.
- There has to be another way.

856
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:41,557
There is.

857
01:30:42,062 --> 01:30:43,935
I can make it right.

858
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:46,524
- Evelyn.
- This is what Ruby meant.

859
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,314
- Evelyn.
- No, no!

860
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:57,531
- I got you.
- Evelyn.

861
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:02,407
No. Evelyn.

862
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:13,585
Oh, my God.

863
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:17,551
God honors sacrifice.

864
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:23,461
And our sacrifices touch God's
heart and move his hand.

865
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:28,441
Jesus said, "This is my commandment.

866
01:31:28,692 --> 01:31:31,941
That you love one another
as I have loved you.

867
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:35,232
Greater love hath no one than this.

868
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,694
That he lay down his
life for his friends."

869
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:43,618
Let us pray.

870
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,252
Wonderful sermon.

871
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:06,796
- You look well, Father.
- Thank you, Mia.

872
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:08,256
And how are you doing?

873
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:10,926
We're doing much better now. Thank you.

874
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:13,136
Has there been any sign of the doll?

875
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:16,848
No, not since that night.
I thought the police took it.

876
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:19,367
But Detective Clarkin
has no record of it.

877
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:24,606
But evil is constant. You cannot
destroy what was never created.

878
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:28,415
I just pray that whomever comes
into contact with the doll next

879
01:32:28,516 --> 01:32:30,003
gets the help they need.

880
01:32:31,713 --> 01:32:33,415
So do we.

881
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:36,952
- Good to see you.
- The same.

882
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:39,496
- Bye, Father.
- Goodbye, Mia.

883
01:32:39,596 --> 01:32:41,764
Oh, I almost forgot.

884
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:46,140
Oh. It's beautiful. Thank you, Father.

885
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:49,965
The loveliest masterpiece
of the heart of God...

886
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:52,188
is the love of a mother.

887
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:56,900
Thank you.

888
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:27,919
Anything I can help you with?

889
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:32,474
Oh, I'm just trying to find
something for my daughter. Thanks.

890
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:34,342
She's a nurse.

891
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,815
Always helping people.

892
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:40,724
We looked everywhere for one of these.

893
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:43,026
Never did find one.

894
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:45,437
It's a collector's item, supposedly.

895
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:48,411
That's why we price it a
little higher than the rest.

896
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,998
- You want me to ring it up?
- Yes, please.
