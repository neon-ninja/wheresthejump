1
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Miss Emerson?

2
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,000
Are you prepared?

3
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,040
I brought this.

4
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,080
Just get it ready. Get it ready.

5
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,240
Life given. Life returned.

6
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,200
Life given. Death lifted.

7
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,280
Take this life force,
consume its flesh.

8
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,200
Open our eyes to what is lost.

9
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,000
<i>Memento mori. Memento mori.</i>

10
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,040
<i>Memento mori. Memento mori.</i>

11
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,280
<i>Memento mori. Memento mori.</i>

12
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,600
<i>Memento mori.
Memento mori. Memento mori.</i>

13
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,040
Who? Whose loss?

14
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,040
This woman?

15
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,600
This grieving woman?

16
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,400
- Darling?
- Oh, God!

17
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,400
Don't look away. You mustn't look away.

18
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,760
Rose? Rose, darling.

19
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,880
I can see you.

20
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,920
I can see you.

21
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,720
Life given. Death lifted.
Life given. Death...

22
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,920
Get off me!

23
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,440
Sergeant Evans, the curtains.

24
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,880
The door! The door!

25
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,160
- Stay there, Captain.
- Get off me!

26
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,480
If you're a captain at all.

27
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,240
Sergeant Evans, fetch the others.

28
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,040
You bastard. You'll kill him!

29
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,680
I’ll fetch a doctor.

30
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,240
I’ll manage.

31
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,640
- Ah! Ow!
- Another miracle.

32
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,760
Miss Cathcart,
you shouldn't do that.

33
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,400
Cathcart. Florence Cathcart.

34
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,240
How dare you come here
under false pretences?

35
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,200
Ls your soldier boy even dead?

36
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,320
And this grotesque charade
won't bring him back.

37
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,800
Neither will your blood capsules
which you slipped from your cup

38
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,160
and your handkerchief as we started.

39
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,200
Nor your free hand pulling the wick
from this woman's candle.

40
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,960
As if the dead had
something against naked flames.

41
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,920
You're charlatans.

42
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,840
And poor ones at that.

43
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,440
Get them out of here, Evans.

44
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,720
Get off! You bastard.

45
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,000
- I’ve got your brooch.
- Oh, thank you, Evans.

46
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,800
Miss Cathcart, when you do these things

47
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,160
you've taken to
ordering me around a little.

48
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,600
I just think with you being...

49
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,120
What, you don't want your colleagues
seeing you bossed by a civilian woman?

50
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,640
Uh, I mean, if anyone was going to
order me around, it'd be...

51
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,720
I mean, if Mrs Evans wasn't Mrs Evans...

52
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,880
But she is.

53
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,960
And she's very lucky, she is.

54
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,560
I won't bully you any more. Promise.

55
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,880
You've never had a child, have you?

56
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,160
No, of course you haven't.

57
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,880
- Allow me, miss.
- Thank you, Katie.

58
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,680
It's all right.

59
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,440
Oh, for heaven's sake. Um...

60
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,720
- Who shall I make it out to?
- I'm sorry?

61
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,640
- Please, Mr...
- Mallory.

62
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,360
Mr Mallory, you'll excuse my brevity,
but this is my home.

63
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,120
- Very glad you enjoyed the book.
- I didn't.

64
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
- Excuse me?
- I didn't much like your book.

65
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,320
I found it too certain.

66
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,000
Perhaps that's only fitting
for someone so rude to strangers.

67
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,000
I’m a history master
at a boy's prep school.

68
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,160
Forgive my daughter, Mr Mallory.

69
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,840
She's not taking on any more work.
She's quite exhausted.

70
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,000
Um, let him speak, Harry. Please.

71
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,480
Um, I’m afraid Harry's right.
I’m really not taking on any more work.

72
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,080
But you are a ghost hunter
as well as an author?

73
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,520
Well, you can't hunt
what doesn't exist.

74
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,200
Ah, well, that's just it.

75
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,040
We think we have one that does.

76
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,080
I need to change.

77
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,200
Katie, will you show
Mr Mallory to my study.

78
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,280
- Yes, miss.
- I’ll be fine.

79
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,480
You're fine?

80
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,520
Mmm.

81
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,400
We always know
why you throw yourself into this.

82
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,720
And we don't blame you
for thinking that it will help.

83
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,080
But every time now, all we can see
is the pain it causes you.

84
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,480
Yes.

85
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,160
I know. I'm sorry I keep
doing this to you.

86
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,040
It's not fair.

87
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
"May your skin be flayed from your body"

88
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,080
"in the hell you so arrogantly claim
does not exist.'"

89
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,080
An elderly woman in Dorset,
I seem to remember.

90
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,160
Our school matron
is a devotee of your book

91
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,240
and has told the headmaster
about the work you do.

92
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,720
She assures him you're quite respected

93
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,880
and your book sits alongside the Bible
on many bookshelves.

94
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,040
Miss Cathcart,
rumour is a dangerous thing.

95
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,680
Conversations in this room
are confidential, Mr Mallory.

96
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,280
Especially if I don't take the case.

97
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,480
Our school is called Rookford
in Cumbria.

98
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,080
Some years ago, a child
was said to have been murdered there.

99
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,800
Not a pupil.
It was a private house then.

100
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,920
Well, who? Did they catch the killer?

101
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,160
There's no record. It was
an important family. All hushed up.

102
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,040
Still, it's perfectly possible
someone died there.

103
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,960
So you're here about a death
that may or may not have happened

104
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,520
however many years ago?

105
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,880
No.

106
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,960
I’m here about another death.

107
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,480
A pupil. Three weeks ago.

108
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,000
His name was Walter. Walter Portman.

109
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,320
The day before he died,
Walter went to see the headmaster,

110
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,360
quaking with fear,
convinced he'd seen a ghost.

111
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,320
The ghost of the murdered child.

112
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,680
Well, how did he know
what the murdered child looked like?

113
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,920
This was taken 18 years ago.

114
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,040
Mr Mallory, this is...
This is an old school prank.

115
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,680
As the camera sweeps across
to expose the plate...

116
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,200
One of the boys runs behind the row
to appear at both sides.

117
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,520
He was still moving
when it reached him.

118
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,360
I know. That was 1902.

119
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,920
This was '03.

120
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,200
'04.

121
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,960
1905.

122
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,960
And, lastly, '06.

123
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:57,200
All the boys in the school
are accounted for.

124
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,160
All of them. In all the photographs.

125
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,600
Including this one,
taken just one month ago.

126
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:06,440
Miss Cathcart, I can understand a child
running the length of the line

127
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,560
in the 15 seconds it takes
for the camera to make its sweep.

128
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,600
What I can't explain is
how he could get there.

129
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,920
The Millford woman.

130
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,240
Either a batch of partially exposed
photographic plates

131
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,680
or the same ghost was
in my mother's potting shed.

132
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,160
It's half-term in two days.

133
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,960
We'll be lucky to get any of
the children back unless...

134
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,440
I’m not interested in the
commercial fortunes of your school.

135
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,000
There have been other sightings.
The boys believe...

136
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,120
Boys believe in Santa Claus
and the Tooth Fairy.

137
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,880
I’m sure some of them
even believe in God.

138
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:49,040
You don't need me
to tell you what happened

139
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,360
to that generation of boys, Mr Mallory,

140
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,040
and yet you don't see their ghosts
stalking the halls of your school.

141
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,560
Rookford is a boarding school,
Miss Cathcart.

142
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,920
Most of the boys
are as good as orphans.

143
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,240
I don't say that
just because of your circumstances.

144
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,400
Well, then, why say it?

145
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,120
"Fear is all I remember of my childhood."

146
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,160
"I have glimpses of my parents' death"

147
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,080
"but nothing of our life in Kenya,
nor coming to London."

148
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,120
"Nothing but a feeling
of perpetual black terror.'"

149
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,880
Your tactics are despicable.

150
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,000
"Fear swallows children
and the adults we become.'"

151
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,280
These boys aren't worried
about bumps in the night.

152
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,520
They are frightened to death.

153
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,440
Please leave.

154
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,040
I was sent to request your help
and I've done that.

155
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,720
You strike me as a woman who won't
do anything she doesn't want to.

156
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,640
I’m at the Wellington Hotel.
Thank you for your time.

157
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,120
<i>Semper veritas.</i>

158
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,640
Latin gives a new school
an air of respectability.

159
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,600
Means they can add a pound to the fees.

160
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:55,360
And I should imagine a boney fide ghost
knocks it right off again.

161
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,760
Latin puns. What fun.

162
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,520
"Always the truth."

163
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,200
Let's see, shall we?

164
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,600
You can't wait.

165
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,720
You're that keen that
people believe in nothing?

166
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,640
No, without science
people don't believe in nothing.

167
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,520
They believe in anything,
including spirits.

168
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,400
So we need them. But you don't.

169
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,640
I believe in evidence.
Need has nothing to do with it.

170
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
And yet you carry
someone else's cigarette case.

171
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,160
Touché.

172
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,480
I’m sorry.

173
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,920
Mr Mallory, am I...

174
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,480
Go on.

175
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,920
Judd.

176
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,320
Hey! Knees, boys!

177
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:01,440
Miss Cathcart, this is Miss Hill
the school matron. Maud to you and! me.

178
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,720
- How do you do?
- Maud?

179
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,560
She's taken this very hard.

180
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,480
She's an odd fish at the best of times.

181
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,440
For a start, she liked your book.

182
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,320
I feel like I know you.

183
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,320
I’ve read your book
a dozen times at least.

184
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,800
It's on my bookshelf next to the Bible.

185
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,600
I’ve never met an educated lady before.

186
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,960
Not Cambridge and everything.

187
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,320
Never mind someone famous.

188
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,680
Oh, the Kaiser was famous, Miss Hill.

189
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,120
I... I just wrote a book.

190
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,720
Maud.

191
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,480
Mr Mallory told you to call me Maud.

192
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,120
Maud.

193
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

194
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,520
Did Mr McNair not say
all boys inside, Thomas?

195
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,000
Tom.

196
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,440
Everyone's nerves are shot to pieces.

197
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:11,240
I’ve been here 14 years.
I know this place.

198
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:14,240
And I don't hold with
any ghostly nonsense.

199
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,480
I just wanted you to know

200
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,360
I’m at your service.

201
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,680
Hello.

202
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,200
Stop it. Go on.

203
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,080
Howell, stick up for yourself.
And get that hair cut.

204
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,960
All of you, downstairs.

205
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,040
Thank you, Maud. I’ll take
Miss Cathcart to the headmaster.

206
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,360
Came with the building.
It's the boys' favourite.

207
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,840
John the Baptist, I think. This way.

208
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,440
It's actually Judith
slaying Holofernes.

209
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:56,720
Story of a woman
who stole into the enemy camp

210
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,320
and seduced then beheaded
their highest general.

211
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,440
Hmm. Those were the days, eh, Maud?

212
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:09,160
I’m not in, I’m out.

213
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,720
At least I was out. Now I'm in.

214
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,840
You must be the ghost lady.
Come through.

215
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,440
Reverend Purslow,
this is Miss Florence Cathcart.

216
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:21,560
An educated woman.
Well, well, well. Glad you're here.

217
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,440
Presume you know
you've a matron to thank.

218
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,640
So I believe. Glad I can be of service.

219
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,200
Child dying before a parent.
Dreadful thing.

220
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,280
I lost three of them.

221
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,120
I imagine you don't believe
in the afterlife, Miss Cathcart.

222
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,760
No, I don't.

223
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,840
Terrible, isn't it?

224
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,240
Mr Mallory will give
you a tour of the school.

225
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,960
I’m on my way to the dining room
should you wish to see it.

226
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,320
Mr Mallory.

227
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,560
So I’m the guide now?

228
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,080
He's coming. He's coming.

229
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,920
After supper there's an hour of scrubs,
that's compulsory reading to you.

230
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,480
OO.

231
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,400
I’ll show you where Walter was found.

232
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,960
I’d like to see everywhere
the boys claim to have seen the ghost.

233
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:19,000
And perhaps you'd ask Maud to join us?

234
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:26,720
Most of the sightings
were in here, including Walter's.

235
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,960
Ln fact, he was found outside
here on the terrace.

236
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:35,360
Many of the boys are now
too frightened to come in here.

237
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,520
Mr Mallory.

238
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,960
She doesn't like any superfluous sound.

239
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,000
<i>"Ego contemno Latin."</i> I hate Latin.

240
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:50,960
That you, Mallory?

241
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,560
Walter was found there.

242
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,120
Mr Broad found him
just before breakfast.

243
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,520
- And these doors were locked?
- Mmm-hmm.

244
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,680
Did he have a bear or a toy animal?

245
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:19,320
- It's in the front office, yes.
- Could you?

246
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,320
You don't like him.

247
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,960
I have my reasons.
It would be indiscreet.

248
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,440
Where are his glasses?
He used to keep up the pretence.

249
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,960
Used to have a limp, too.
Kept him out of the trenches.

250
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,680
- His mother couldn't bear to keep it.
- Thank you.

251
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,320
And this was still on his bed
the morning he was found?

252
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,880
Yes.

253
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,520
You said there were other sightings
elsewhere in the house?

254
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
Yes. Mostly in the west dormitory.

255
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,880
Maud, perhaps I could
leave this to you?

256
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,760
- Why aren't you at scrubs?
- My book, sir.

257
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,160
Are you all right?

258
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,400
And it's half-term tomorrow?

259
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,880
Boys with parents in
far-flung places stay behind.

260
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,840
Apart from that,
we have the place to ourselves.

261
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,280
Was he bullied?

262
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:11,600
They called him "Wheezy Walter".
He was asthmatic.

263
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,200
Who were his friends?

264
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,080
Did he have any friends?

265
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,560
Miss Cathcart, this is a good school.

266
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,840
But if you're different,
the wrong kind of different...

267
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:25,200
His isn't the only mattress like this.

268
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,000
"Then spake King Arthur
to Sir Bedivere."

269
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,840
"The sequel of today unsolders all"

270
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,640
"The goodliest fellowship
of famous knights."

271
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,880
"'Whereof this world hold record."

272
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,360
"Such a sleep they sleep,
the men I loved."

273
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,120
"I think that we shall...

274
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,240
"We shall never more, at..."

275
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,360
"I think that we shall never more,
at any future time,

276
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,880
"Delight our souls
with talk of knightly deeds."

277
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,760
Dowden!

278
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,440
Now.

279
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,520
Matron, I presume you've brought this
young lady to my classroom for a purpose

280
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,600
besides subjecting her to the
outrageous behaviour of Mr Dowden?

281
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,640
Mr McNair. Boys,

282
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,840
I know you're all upset and
frightened at the moment.

283
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,280
Well, Miss Cathcart is here
to put your fears to bed.

284
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:38,880
She's one of the cleverest people
in England. Miss Cathcart.

285
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,200
Stand.

286
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:48,520
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

287
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,040
Sit. Please sit.

288
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,560
How many of you did
Walter Portman talk to about this ghost?

289
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,800
Well, did any of you
see this ghost boy for yourselves?

290
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,440
I did, miss. I saw it.

291
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,040
Stand, boy.

292
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,600
Would you like to come with me
and describe...

293
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,680
It was horrible.
It was on the upper corridor.

294
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,240
- Wouldn't you rather...
- His face was twisted.

295
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:19,160
Blurred and sort of twisted.

296
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,440
Like in the photographs.

297
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,600
But he was in pain. Crying out.

298
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,440
It was him. Please kill it, miss.

299
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,760
Yes, please. Kill it, miss.

300
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,480
Silence.

301
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,240
Pocket Premo,
12 exposure pack with meniscus lens.

302
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:38,800
Sound recorder, part Bell-Tainter.

303
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,480
Fumigator for measuring contact traces.

304
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,880
Can Walter's dormitory sleep
elsewhere in the house?

305
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,720
We could move their mattresses
to the dining room.

306
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,000
Marconi magnetic field detector.

307
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,120
Third of an ounce of magnesium
and potassium chlorate per tray.

308
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:59,840
As the wire is tripped the aperture
opens for a thirtieth of a second,

309
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,960
and an electrical charge
ignites the powder.

310
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,320
- What about these?
- Those are footprint catchers.

311
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,680
Ghosts have footprints?

312
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,880
No, people pretending to be ghosts do.

313
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,360
They must hate you.

314
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,760
Who? The spiritualists?

315
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,040
No, the ghosts.

316
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,640
Be quiet.

317
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,240
You'll be quiet or so help me!

318
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,560
Victor, you did the run today.

319
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:27,160
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

320
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,000
What's this mess?

321
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,080
Will she do what they say? The lady?

322
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,000
And what do they say?

323
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,080
That she'll kill the ghost.

324
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:52,360
And that one boy a night will die
until she does.

325
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,640
She's not here to catch ghosts.

326
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,760
She's here to catch
naughty boys up to mischief.

327
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,160
Silence now. Eyes closed.

328
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,880
It'll be dark soon.

329
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,080
Pary.

330
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,720
Parry.

331
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,560
Nobody...

332
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,720
Likes...

333
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,000
You!

334
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,920
Be quiet.

335
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,280
You'll be quiet or so help me!

336
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,920
Shh! Keep still.

337
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,520
Hello?

338
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,000
I heard bells. Are you all right?

339
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,560
First bell!

340
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,320
First bell!

341
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,960
Next three boys, please.
Quieten down.

342
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,240
Next.

343
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,920
Boys who have been seen
can go to their classrooms at once.

344
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,560
They couldn't have
been made with socks?

345
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,960
The prints I followed
were definitely barefoot.

346
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,640
- Get back!
- Come on. Come on.

347
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,520
Why are we here, sir?

348
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:23,800
All right, turn around,
stick your feet up.

349
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,400
Headmaster.

350
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,520
Parry.

351
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:38,320
- Sir.
- Parry.

352
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,840
What would your father have thought?

353
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,320
The night Walter died,
he got up to use the latrine.

354
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,040
He wasn't wearing his spectacles.

355
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,640
Mr Parry here frightened him,
using this to blur his face.

356
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:50,920
I didn't. I didn't do it to Walter.

357
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,160
And last night he tried to do
the same thing to me. Didn't you?

358
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,600
Victor.

359
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,920
They said if I did it

360
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,520
then they'd be nice.

361
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:09,320
- Stop snivelling.
- Malcolm, please.

362
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:11,960
Who?

363
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,440
- Them.
- Scab!

364
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:15,960
- Quiet!
- But I didn't do it before.

365
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:18,480
Not to Walter.
I liked Walter. We shared grots.

366
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,800
- Victor.
- I didn't scare him.

367
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,560
- No one knows who did.
- A boy is dead.

368
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:24,360
- Wasn't me!
- All right, it wasn't just him.

369
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,200
There was another boy last night.

370
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,320
I saw him down in the stairwell.

371
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,640
What?

372
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,080
Dowden?

373
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,320
- There wasn't another boy.
- Ah-ah-ah. You're behind this.

374
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,160
- Honestly, sir.
- You will name this other boy now.

375
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,960
There wasn't another boy. Please!

376
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,200
You will name this boy or you'll be
thrashed where you stand. Mr McNair.

377
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,480
Honestly. No, there wasn't
another boy, sir.

378
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:45,720
Please, I tell you, sir.
There wasn't another boy!

379
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,360
Please, sir, I promise,
it was only me!

380
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,720
Wait, stop!

381
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,400
Honestly,
I’m telling you the truth.

382
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,120
For God's sakes. You've done quite
enough damage, you will not do this.

383
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:58,360
What did you say?

384
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,200
You use a balsam for your chest.

385
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:05,680
I just smelled it on you.

386
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,240
I also found it smeared on the glass of
the French doors and on the handles

387
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,600
and on Walter's bear.

388
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,680
You were... You were there
the night he died.

389
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,640
I protest. This is...

390
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,840
And did he protest
when you found him downstairs,

391
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,240
ripped the bear from him
and left him out in the dark?

392
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:26,600
I came here to protect children
from fear and you...

393
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,120
You are hell-bent
on making them live in it.

394
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,440
- You can't die of fear.
- No.

395
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,440
But you can die of an asthma attack
brought on by it.

396
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:53,960
- He was alive when I left him.
- Malcolm.

397
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,880
He was crying,

398
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,720
insisting he'd seen a ghost.

399
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,240
I thought...

400
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,480
I thought I'd toughen him up.

401
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:17,600
It's not enough
to be mollycoddled, Robert.

402
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,600
These boys must be strong.

403
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,120
Stronger than us.

404
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,080
Malcolm, there's not
a man on earth I’d rather protect.

405
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:43,480
But the parents arrive shortly,
and I must ask you to leave this school

406
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:44,880
at once.

407
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:20,880
♫ Be still, my soul ♫

408
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:25,520
♫ Though dearest friends depart ♫

409
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,680
There was a chap in a trench
not far from ours.

410
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,720
He used to sing this hymn most sunsets.

411
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,320
It's odd separating the past
from the present.

412
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,080
The boys are transformed.
You should be pleased.

413
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,480
<i>Semper veritas.</i>

414
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,080
- Mmm.
- Truth comes at a price.

415
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,800
Ruined a damaged man.

416
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,120
Oh, I’m not thinking about Malcolm.

417
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,400
Nor are you.

418
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,560
I saw you.

419
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:21,920
As soon as you proved the ghost was
a fraud, something happened to you.

420
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,400
- You were suddenly...
- Please, Robert.

421
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,000
I’ve done what was asked of me.

422
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:32,920
Proved there's nothing to fear.

423
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,240
Nothing.

424
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,200
You left church early.

425
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:06,400
Mr Judd.

426
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:07,960
You going home?

427
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,600
Found your ghost?

428
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,120
Another case to write up
while McNair's thrown to the dogs.

429
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:18,880
After all he's been through.

430
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,400
You know, I wonder
whether any of us really know

431
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,120
what he went through, Mr Judd.

432
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:28,880
- You shouldn't talk to me like that.
- Excuse me?

433
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,240
- I’m sorry. I didn't mean to...
- You think I don't know?

434
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,960
Staying at home was wrong?

435
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,320
Come down here

436
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,600
and tell me that?

437
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:49,560
Let me tell you something, ghost lady.

438
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,600
It's the living you wanna watch out for.

439
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,320
Not the dead.

440
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,200
There she is. Now try to forget
all about it. The headmaster will.

441
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:13,880
Getting to go home. Cakes and puddings.

442
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:16,040
Lucky beggars.

443
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,000
Still, we'll have a nice time.

444
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:21,480
You always say that.

445
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,280
Lucky beggars. You always say that.

446
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,280
No!

447
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,080
There's nothing.

448
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:36,120
There's nothing.

449
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,360
Goodbye. See you in a week.

450
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,400
Check the out buildings
before you go, Mr Baxter.

451
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,320
There are gypsies on the Tarrow farm.

452
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:26,720
Your ma and pa overseas, Tom?

453
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,880
They live in India.

454
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,080
Takes three weeks to travel to India.
They have tigers there.

455
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,840
Goodbye, Matron.

456
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:37,640
Mary.

457
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,280
Have you been?

458
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:42,080
No.

459
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,520
No, but I’ve seen the lions in Africa.

460
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:49,000
One of them even attacked me.

461
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:52,880
How come you're not dead?

462
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,800
Apparently I was rescued
by one of the villagers.

463
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,000
Actually, a tribal chieftain.

464
00:46:58,519 --> 00:46:59,880
Did he kill the lion?

465
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,960
I was very young. I think so.

466
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:06,880
The villagers took me in
and looked after me until help came.

467
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,160
They called me their "Mowa-Zee".

468
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,680
White doll.

469
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,920
I wonder what they'd think of me today,
seeing me in such a silly state.

470
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
- Tom, can you leave us now?
- Were your mother and father with you?

471
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,800
Were they killed?

472
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,760
Afraid they were.

473
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,000
Tom, Miss Cathcart and I
want a grown-up conversation.

474
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,520
I like grown-up conversations.

475
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,000
Now.

476
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,240
Goodbye, Mowa-Zee.

477
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,120
Maud, it was an accident.

478
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:49,120
I lost my cigarette case.

479
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,040
How could someone like you
want to do such a thing?

480
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,400
I don't want to talk about it.

481
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,840
Don't go. Miss,
something has happened to you.

482
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,400
You can't leave this house now.

483
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,400
Please stop calling me miss.
It's Florence.

484
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,080
And I can't stay here.

485
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,000
I’m sorry.

486
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,840
Thank you.

487
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:27,160
I’ll be gone in an hour.

488
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,480
I fell.

489
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:39,960
I fell.

490
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,320
I know you're there, Robert.

491
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:08,200
Please don't go away.

492
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,200
Don't go.

493
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,760
<i>You must be the ghost lady.</i>

494
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,920
<i>Come through.</i>

495
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,520
Good evening.

496
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:38,160
Good evening.

497
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,200
<i>Be quiet.</i>

498
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,200
<i>You'll be quiet or so help me!</i>

499
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,000
Mr Mallory, I need your help.

500
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,320
You're not going?

501
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,120
Some of the equipment needs resetting.

502
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:56,520
- Can I...
- I don't understand.

503
00:53:56,679 --> 00:53:58,800
You have your culprit.
You're doing more?

504
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,200
- Oh, would you...
- No, thank you.

505
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,080
Don't you like sherry?

506
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:05,160
I need to keep my wits about me.

507
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:08,320
I don't think
I shall ever drink alcohol.

508
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,720
- It makes you cross and sick.
- Mr Judd,

509
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,080
you're welcome to join us.

510
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,480
Things to do, Matron.

511
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:17,520
Mallory.

512
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:20,960
Mr Mallory.

513
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,920
Florence, what are you doing?

514
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,240
I was brought here to explain
a phenomenon in this house,

515
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,480
and whatever everyone else may believe,
I have yet to do that.

516
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:32,920
A collective delusion
has been experienced here,

517
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,560
a child moving through the house
as if there were no walls or floors.

518
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,960
You said that a child was murdered here.

519
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:41,680
What if that was also caused by...

520
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,680
You're doing this because of a feeling?

521
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,000
- This morning, you were...
- This is not a feeling!

522
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:49,000
This is a thesis. It's science.

523
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:52,680
- Tell me about the original murder.
- One can't even be sure there was one.

524
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,280
- Something is causing this.
- Two hours ago, you...

525
00:54:58,079 --> 00:54:59,800
- Florence, why are you doing this?
- Florence.

526
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:07,680
- What is it?
- A differential thermometer.

527
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,920
It means this side of the corridor
has suddenly become

528
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:13,160
much colder than that side.

529
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,600
You said this was a private house.

530
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:21,240
Housemaids often had hidden cupboards

531
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:25,040
for mops and brooms and so forth.

532
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:34,000
May even be stairs to the upper levels.

533
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,000
I know this.

534
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,760
It's an old nursery rhyme.

535
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,520
Ladybird, ladybird,

536
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,680
fly away home.

537
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,600
Your house is on fire.

538
00:56:33,639 --> 00:56:35,360
Your children are gone.

539
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,280
All except one.

540
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,040
We need to work. Lock the house.

541
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,360
- Florence, you don't need...
- Robert, lock the house.

542
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,000
This is nothing,
it's a silly nursery rhyme.

543
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,760
I’m frightened.

544
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,840
Tom.

545
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,240
- Tom.
- He wants to get me.

546
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,000
Tom, nothing is going
to happen to you. Nothing.

547
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,240
I promise you that.

548
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:11,280
Now I must work.
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

549
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,320
Can I sit with you? I won't talk.

550
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:55,120
Of course.

551
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,480
I get in trouble for talking.

552
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,200
But I don't talk much.

553
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,720
Did you have any friends at school?

554
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,080
You can talk to me.

555
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,400
I have make-believe friends. Sometimes.

556
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:27,120
There's nothing wrong with that.
Many children do. I know I did.

557
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,680
What was his name?

558
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:34,840
I’m not sure he had a name.

559
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,120
- Do yours have names?
- You're still lonely.

560
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:40,560
Aren't you?

561
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:45,440
I can tell.

562
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,640
With the boys at school, too,

563
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:49,680
I can tell.

564
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,280
You had a real friend once.

565
00:58:55,159 --> 00:58:56,600
And you don't any more.

566
00:58:58,119 --> 00:58:59,920
Did you love him or something?

567
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,400
Yes, I loved him.

568
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:10,280
He was a very kind man,
a very good man.

569
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,920
But I was...

570
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:23,440
I did something
very silly and very cruel.

571
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,560
I think I was frightened of losing him,
I loved him so much.

572
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,920
He was in the war.

573
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,520
What did you do?

574
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,200
I wrote to him and told him

575
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,640
I couldn't marry him
and I didn't love him any more.

576
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,800
What did he say?

577
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,480
He died.

578
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,840
Not long after he got the letter.

579
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:54,680
But you did love him.

580
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,480
That's why you want him back.

581
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:13,840
Thank you. Mowa-Zee.

582
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:24,440
I don't think there's a place on earth

583
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:27,440
people understand loneliness
better than here.

584
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:48,040
You're torturing yourself.
Is that what you're doing here?

585
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:50,200
Proving again and again
that he's really gone?

586
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:52,920
- Twisting the blade in deeper?
- You tell me.

587
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:54,120
Why? Is it guilt?

588
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:55,640
Preaching to me while
you rip your leg to shreds

589
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:58,080
as if that'll make you feel better
for having survived!

590
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,800
You don't know what
you're talking about.

591
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,320
Robert.

592
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,160
I’m frightened.

593
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,240
And I can't live with that.

594
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,320
And yes, you're right,
what I do comes at a price.

595
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,880
I hate myself more and more,
but I can't live with fear.

596
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:27,280
I’d sooner be dead myself.

597
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:40,000
Red four goes on the black five.

598
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:43,480
Every card has its place.

599
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,160
When they're back where they should be,
you win the game.

600
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,720
And that goes there.

601
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,280
That one there.

602
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:56,360
Black eight can go on red nine.

603
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,360
It takes time.

604
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,320
That's why they call it "patience".

605
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,800
She's downstairs.

606
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,840
- Mowa-Zee.
- Tom. Tom!

607
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,760
Tom!

608
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,200
I know it's you, Tom.

609
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,680
I won't chase you.

610
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:40,600
Keep playing.

611
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,840
Florence.

612
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,800
Why are you doing this? You!

613
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,520
I heard you giggle.

614
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:34,960
- I heard him giggle.
- Florence!

615
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,560
You took me to a man.
Who was he? Who was he?

616
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,680
There was a... There was a man!
There was... There was a man!

617
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,800
Stop this!

618
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:44,360
It's... It's all of you!

619
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,280
You're all doing this!

620
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,800
You, you...

621
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,920
You cruel and horrid little boy.

622
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,760
Florence!

623
01:05:53,719 --> 01:05:55,320
I hate you.

624
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,600
Thomas Hill, you will come back here
at once and apologise.

625
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:03,880
Stop bossing me around.
I haven't done anything wrong.

626
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:08,960
I don't recognise you.

627
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,320
I thought you were a kind,
loving girl but there's...

628
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:15,240
There's nothing left.

629
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:22,240
You're a shell.

630
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:38,760
She's very troubled.

631
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,240
You have to understand that.

632
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,600
She likes you very, very much.

633
01:07:01,639 --> 01:07:03,360
She doesn't care about me.

634
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,040
I may as well be dead like Walter.

635
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,320
I hate her.

636
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,560
Robert, I need your help.

637
01:07:42,679 --> 01:07:45,800
He had a shotgun, and he was there,

638
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,440
and one of these will prove it.

639
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:57,160
I can leave an amber light on,
but are you...

640
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,400
I’ll be fine.

641
01:08:12,519 --> 01:08:14,560
If you could just lift them.

642
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,720
That's good.

643
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,640
The dark used to bother me.

644
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,800
Later, of course, it came to mean
safety, no sniper fire, or...

645
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:29,400
- Thank you.
- ...shells, but

646
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,640
as a lad I’d huddle into my bed,

647
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:39,360
wanting to see what was there
but too frightened to open my eyes.

648
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,200
Thank you.

649
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:47,800
It's never darker than when we close
our eyes and yet we keep them shut.

650
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:52,760
Why is that?

651
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:56,800
Thank you.

652
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:10,000
The motion's not blurred,
so even if he's moving

653
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:12,560
one of these will have him clearly.

654
01:09:13,159 --> 01:09:15,080
Why do you keep
your eyes closed, Florence?

655
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,160
Where is he?

656
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,880
Oh, God.

657
01:09:36,199 --> 01:09:37,680
No.

658
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,240
You're real.

659
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:30,880
I am.

660
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:40,400
Why are these things here?
What do they want with me?

661
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,920
Maybe they aren't here for you.

662
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,760
Tom, stay here. Do not leave this room.

663
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,240
No! No! No!

664
01:13:56,039 --> 01:13:57,480
Open the door.

665
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,080
Have you left this room?
Something's happened to Florence.

666
01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:23,640
- Promise me you'll stay here.
- All right.

667
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,080
Tom!

668
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:26,520
I promise.

669
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,880
Maud! Florence!

670
01:14:38,439 --> 01:14:39,800
I saw you.

671
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,240
I saw you with him.

672
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:45,200
The war hero.

673
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:46,840
I don't know what you...

674
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:51,080
I’ve seen plenty through these windows
making my rounds, but never that.

675
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:57,120
Women. Just lap up
the sob stories, don't you?

676
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,560
They were sent, you know.
They didn't sign up.

677
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,600
Suddenly they're heroes.

678
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,040
How dare you!

679
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,360
You did nothing,

680
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,480
and you think you can mock men like him?

681
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,200
You take care of what you're saying.

682
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:19,400
You did... You did nothing
when men gave every...

683
01:15:52,439 --> 01:15:54,240
No!

684
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,600
Robert! Robert!

685
01:17:19,239 --> 01:17:21,280
Whatever happened?
What's happened, Florence?

686
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:23,680
- Florence, what is it? My darling girl!
- Florence!

687
01:17:25,239 --> 01:17:26,800
Judd attacked me.

688
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:31,920
He tried to... He tried to...
I think I killed him.

689
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,360
- I think I killed him.
- Maud, get a blanket.

690
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:35,920
And run a bath. Now, please.

691
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,760
Where? Where's Judd?

692
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,240
By the trees at the end of the driveway.

693
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,240
No, go inside. Get to Maud
and stay there. You hear?

694
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,520
Robert. Robert, don't tell Tom.

695
01:17:53,239 --> 01:17:54,240
Tom?

696
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:57,000
Little Tom. He's frightened enough.
He's the only child here.

697
01:17:57,079 --> 01:18:00,080
Florence, there are no children here.
It's just us three!

698
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:03,280
What?

699
01:18:36,039 --> 01:18:37,520
<i>Mowa-Zee.</i>

700
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:40,920
<i>Mowa-Zee.</i>

701
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,160
<i>Mowa-Zee.</i>

702
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:06,880
<i>Mowa-Zee.</i>

703
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:41,160
<i>I didn't mean to
scare Walter that night.</i>

704
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,240
I know.

705
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,040
I believe you.

706
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,640
You can control that?

707
01:20:21,319 --> 01:20:22,960
Sometimes I can.

708
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,400
But I don't know why he could see me.

709
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,440
No one sees me.

710
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:32,160
I can't make them.

711
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,400
We see what we need to.

712
01:20:37,159 --> 01:20:38,720
He needed a friend.

713
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,000
So did I.

714
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:45,240
But you were frightened. When you
heard the music from that rabbit doll

715
01:20:45,319 --> 01:20:47,440
you said someone was going to get you.

716
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,440
- Who were you frightened of?
- I can't tell you.

717
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,040
Please. Tell me, please.

718
01:20:52,119 --> 01:20:53,760
You have to see for yourself.

719
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,080
It's the only way we can be together.

720
01:20:58,439 --> 01:20:59,960
Again.

721
01:21:02,119 --> 01:21:03,560
What?

722
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,840
Promise you won't go away again.

723
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,160
Mousie.

724
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:09,920
Mow-zee?

725
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,000
Look at the doll's house. Look at it.

726
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,080
- No.
- You started to remember,

727
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:19,320
- I know you did.
- No.

728
01:21:19,399 --> 01:21:20,720
Look at it. You'll remember the rest.

729
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,920
- Look at it.
- I don't want to look.

730
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,280
You started to remember, I know you did.
Look at the house.

731
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:27,160
- I don't want to look! Get away from me!
- Look at the house.

732
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,160
<i>Mousie.</i>

733
01:21:41,239 --> 01:21:43,240
<i>You started to remember!
</i>You started!

734
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,560
<i>You started to remember!
I know you did!</i>

735
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:52,160
<i>But you go on and on!</i>

736
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:55,600
<i>I don't even wanna look at you!
I can't live like this!</i>

737
01:21:56,039 --> 01:21:58,280
<i>Look at it.
You'll remember the rest.</i>

738
01:22:02,439 --> 01:22:06,520
<i>You don't know! You scheme
and you laugh at me and plot!</i>

739
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,920
<i>No one is plotting.
It's just that we can't care any more.</i>

740
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,920
<i>You make it impossible to care.
You don't speak for days.</i>

741
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,320
<i>You don't speak to me.
You won't even look at her.</i>

742
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,960
Be quiet. You will be quiet,
or so help me!

743
01:22:23,159 --> 01:22:25,720
Your own child?
You despise her.

744
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,280
- You're a monster!
- She's not a boy!

745
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:30,640
She's bright,
and she's sweet, and she's...

746
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,000
- Give me a son! Stay here!
- You have one!

747
01:22:39,239 --> 01:22:41,760
How do you think that makes me feel
watching your bastard boy

748
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,200
running around with... Your bastard boy
running around with Florence!

749
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:46,440
Leave Tom out of this!

750
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:52,680
Making us pay because you...

751
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:54,760
Mummy! Mummy!

752
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,680
Stay back, Florence.
You can't help Mummy now.

753
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,440
Move out of the way!

754
01:23:09,159 --> 01:23:12,680
You can't help Mummy now.
Move out of the way!

755
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:22,320
You can't help Mummy now.
Move out of the way!

756
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,360
I need you to move out of the way.

757
01:23:34,439 --> 01:23:36,120
Please, Daddy.

758
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:39,600
Mousie, Mousie, run! Run!

759
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,720
Think I don't know
your little hiding places?

760
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:58,560
Know where my little mouse
hides herself for hours on end?

761
01:24:22,039 --> 01:24:23,680
Little Mousie.

762
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:36,520
Little Mousie.

763
01:24:43,239 --> 01:24:45,280
I really am sorry, Little Mousie.

764
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:57,400
I will find you, darling.

765
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:05,520
You have to go with Mummy now.

766
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,000
Mousie.

767
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:53,600
Mousie.

768
01:25:56,279 --> 01:25:57,560
Little Mousie.

769
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:41,000
You never said school.

770
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:49,120
From the moment you arrived,
you called this place a house.

771
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,560
You, nanny.

772
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:56,640
Tom's mother.

773
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,720
I thought bringing you here
would be enough.

774
01:26:59,399 --> 01:27:01,880
But you didn't remember me,
let alone the terrible things.

775
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:05,280
I knew your little mind had
blacked it all out.

776
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:07,640
But one thing kept me certain.

777
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,160
You saw him.

778
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,000
You saw my...

779
01:27:14,279 --> 01:27:15,640
My

780
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,160
darling

781
01:27:19,319 --> 01:27:20,760
murdered child,

782
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:26,840
who's lived here all these years
with friends he could never have.

783
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,360
I was his friend.

784
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,120
We shared everything.

785
01:27:35,119 --> 01:27:36,480
A father,

786
01:27:37,079 --> 01:27:38,440
everything.

787
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,320
But you needed to see.

788
01:27:41,159 --> 01:27:44,560
That's why I sent Tom
to frighten you those times.

789
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,520
To make you stay.

790
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,840
Because I know what's best for you.

791
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,480
I always did.

792
01:27:54,039 --> 01:27:55,840
Because I raised you.

793
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,480
I wet-nursed you.

794
01:27:59,159 --> 01:28:01,360
I watched you

795
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,320
taken away,

796
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,520
adopted.

797
01:28:07,479 --> 01:28:11,600
You were ripped from me
like my boy had been.

798
01:28:15,319 --> 01:28:17,640
I never asked anything of the world.

799
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:21,560
And it's a perfect hell on earth

800
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,600
to give a woman children to love

801
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:30,320
and to rob her of them.

802
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,040
Little Tom.

803
01:28:50,439 --> 01:28:52,000
Little Tom.

804
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:20,920
I’d forgotten everything.

805
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,160
Well, perhaps not everything.

806
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,720
"Eaten by lions."

807
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:34,600
Well, all memories are
a hoax of some sort.

808
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:38,040
You can't blame anyone
for letting you believe that one.

809
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,440
Mmm.

810
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:46,800
You needn't worry.

811
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,840
No one will find Judd's body.

812
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,040
I’ve buried better men than him.

813
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,880
You see your own ghosts, too?

814
01:30:10,039 --> 01:30:13,480
Are they with us now?

815
01:30:23,239 --> 01:30:24,440
Your friends.

816
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,880
They look like my friends.

817
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,240
They don't have the right.

818
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:36,720
No amount of guilt deserves
the pain you inflict on yourself.

819
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,560
- They died. I lived.
- No, you didn't.

820
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:42,040
A life haunted

821
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,440
isn't a life at all.

822
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:48,280
We may as well

823
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:52,040
be ghosts ourselves.

824
01:30:58,039 --> 01:31:00,280
Light a fire, get some glasses.

825
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,640
Someone once told me
it makes one cross and sick.

826
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:42,040
Tom, what... What is it? What's wrong?

827
01:31:42,119 --> 01:31:43,960
Mother said it would be all right.

828
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,240
She said that you would want us to.

829
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,000
The loneliest boys are
starting to see Tom now,

830
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:55,480
but will he listen to me?
Will he hide? He needs you.

831
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,200
Maud, I’m going home.

832
01:32:00,279 --> 01:32:02,240
Imagine what a fright you gave me
going in the lake like that

833
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:04,000
before you saw the truth.

834
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,360
But it's all right now.

835
01:32:09,159 --> 01:32:10,960
Because he can have you forever.

836
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,040
Everything in its place.

837
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:16,400
Maud

838
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:19,320
knows best.

839
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,440
Robert!

840
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,080
Florence?

841
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,080
- Florence?
- Mr Mallory!

842
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:33,760
Florence and I will be leaving now.

843
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:36,680
Tom needs his family with him.

844
01:32:37,479 --> 01:32:39,440
Florence? Florence?

845
01:32:40,119 --> 01:32:43,320
Robert, the medicine cabinet
in Maud's room. Quickly.

846
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,080
Something to make me sick.
Something to make me sick.

847
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:49,120
Oh, God! No! No!

848
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:54,560
Tom?

849
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:58,320
Tom?

850
01:33:01,359 --> 01:33:05,720
Don't be angry,
I just miss you.

851
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:07,920
All the time.

852
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:13,680
My whole life I’ve never been happy,
not one second since you left me.

853
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:18,720
But I can't... I can't... I can't come.

854
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:20,560
You know that, don't you?

855
01:33:23,239 --> 01:33:25,200
You're the only friend I’ve ever had.

856
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:31,000
But if I go with you now,
my soul will never be happy, and I...

857
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:34,560
I can be, thanks to you.

858
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,080
But you won't need me.

859
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,440
No one will need me.

860
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:42,880
Tom, you must be brave.

861
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:47,160
Can you move through the house
like there are no walls?

862
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:49,320
No walls and no floors.

863
01:33:49,399 --> 01:33:51,000
Help her, help her, help her!

864
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,440
Then fly, little Tom.

865
01:33:55,399 --> 01:33:56,760
Fly.

866
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,640
Are you dead?

867
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:20,480
Are you dying?

868
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:22,560
I don't know.

869
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,280
I need to sleep.

870
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:29,440
I need to close my eyes.

871
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,160
I’ll stay with you.

872
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:34,480
I promise.

873
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:37,600
Even if you can't see me.

874
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:41,720
I can...

875
01:34:42,199 --> 01:34:44,600
I can feel you now.

876
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,880
I’ll tell the boys
it was an accident, of course.

877
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,160
They'll be devastated. They adored her.

878
01:35:45,399 --> 01:35:47,520
We all did. Uh-uh-uh.

879
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:51,840
I can only think the Walter incident
hit her harder than we thought.

880
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,800
Mind you,
the Cathcart girl didn't help.

881
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:57,320
I suspect she wasn't
altogether well herself.

882
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:00,600
You know, I read a study last term.

883
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:03,840
Ladies minds often can't cope
with further education.

884
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:20,000
I know you're there.

885
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,000
That's more than your headmaster does.

886
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:31,960
I used to play here.

887
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:33,560
Hide and seek.

888
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,160
She would...

889
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,840
Maud would sit over there.

890
01:36:48,079 --> 01:36:49,640
I’m thinking of writing another book.

891
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,120
<i>The Interpretation of Ghosts.</i>

892
01:36:54,119 --> 01:36:56,120
Oh, God help us.

893
01:36:58,600 --> 01:36:59,960
Victor, do your laces.

894
01:37:04,359 --> 01:37:06,720
- Hello.
- Hello, again.

895
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,400
Actually, Robert,
can you tell the driver to wait for me

896
01:37:11,479 --> 01:37:12,840
at the end of drive?

897
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,280
I like the walk.

898
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,280
I always have.

899
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,880
Till Saturday week.

900
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,160
Not seeing them...

901
01:37:32,119 --> 01:37:34,200
It's not the same as forgetting.

902
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,440
It isn't.

903
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:54,360
- Hello.
- Hello.
