1
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,918
Bill?

2
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:20,873
It's like a nightmare...

3
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:21,974
Last night?

4
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,880
...my life.

5
00:02:28,054 --> 00:02:29,402
Are you scared?

6
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:33,274
I get scared.

7
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,015
Of what?

8
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:41,234
My parents, ah, my sister.

9
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,888
You.

10
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:51,021
Why?

11
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:55,806
I don't know.

12
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:02,984
I feel like something's
going to happen...

13
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:09,597
...and if I scratch the surface there'll
be something terrible underneath.

14
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:13,815
It is perfectly normal
to experience a certain...

15
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,043
...irrational fear.

16
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:20,044
It's no more than a phase.

17
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,083
It will pass, I assure you.

18
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,923
Come and get it, Milo!

19
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:22,839
Is that confidence or what?

20
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:26,450
- A matter of good breeding Milo.
- Yeah you're Mr Perfect!

21
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:29,670
You'll probably end up
assassinating the President.

22
00:05:29,757 --> 00:05:33,148
You have one warped sense of humor,
you know that?

23
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,063
Blanchard!

24
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,806
Jenny!

25
00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:48,894
What?

26
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:50,722
Blanchard is here!

27
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:54,289
Damn it, Bill, you know I can't see him.

28
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:55,855
Will you get rid of him for me, please?

29
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,291
What are brothers for, huh?

30
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,983
- Let go of me!
- I'm sorry about this, I didn't mean!

31
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:15,549
Just give me a minute, I can explain this!

32
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:17,116
Jenny, come on!

33
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:18,117
Listen to me!

34
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:22,552
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- I know how this looks!

35
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:27,598
Get out! Get out!

36
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:35,036
- Something very weird is going on here!
- Oh, no shit

37
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:36,604
I have to talk to you

38
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:38,779
I didn't know you had to hide
in a closet to talk.

39
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:41,647
- Bill, she's playing games with me, man.
I'm serious! - Liar!

40
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,738
Jen... Bill...

41
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:50,218
David, why do you keep bothering
my daughter?

42
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:53,830
- Mrs. Whitney, I just want to talk to her.
- Please, please...

43
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,656
...just leave!

44
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:56,657
C'mon Blanchard.

45
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:01,051
All right. I...

46
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:10,447
What's going on here, guys?

47
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:12,361
Oh, it was nothing, Dad.

48
00:08:12,665 --> 00:08:13,796
It's okay, Daddy.

49
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:18,492
I thought we weren't going
to see David Blanchard any more.

50
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,799
Yes, Daddy.

51
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:23,932
You should be getting ready.

52
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:27,193
You know Judge Carter
will be there tonight.

53
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:29,108
I'm almost ready know.

54
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:33,503
Oh, ah...

55
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:34,894
Bill...

56
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:36,763
Wasn't that Milo outside?

57
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:39,810
Yeah, yeah,
he was just goin to take me to the...

58
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:42,724
...ah the game.

59
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:57,252
- You okay?
- Sure!

60
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:01,559
So you want to tell me
what's going on with Blanchard?

61
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:05,518
I don't know, jealous I guess.
He just wasn't the right sort for me.

62
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:08,825
Could you zip me up Billy?

63
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:18,743
Something wrong?

64
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,964
Ah, no, no
It's just a little damp.

65
00:09:26,268 --> 00:09:28,574
Well, I'm not taking another shower.

66
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:29,922
Yeah.

67
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,316
But I'm really sorry
that I'm going to miss your coming out.

68
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:38,839
What a coincidence
the way things turn out, huh?

69
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:43,406
Yeah, come on, basketball's much more important
than a stupid coming out party.

70
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:46,714
Besides, I have already been dating
for years. Joke.

71
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,628
Yeah.

72
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,369
We are...

73
00:09:53,456 --> 00:09:54,630
...the one!

74
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,414
We are the one!

75
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,416
We are the one!

76
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,112
All right!

77
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:06,419
The hero, the best player,
our hero...

78
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:08,810
...Bill Whitney!

79
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:12,856
All right!

80
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:15,727
Isn't he wonderful?

81
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:19,469
You are for the girls!

82
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:22,035
We are number one!

83
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:29,344
They are just using
their athletic ability to get the votes...

84
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,084
...of the childish morons
in this audience.

85
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,652
Looks to me like you just lost
the moron vote Marty.

86
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:46,526
Alright!
Hey, let's carry on with the debate!

87
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:52,833
Candidate Whitney, you may respond
concerning the proposed dress code.

88
00:10:58,316 --> 00:10:59,447
Yeah...

89
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:01,274
Well...

90
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:08,363
We should have a dress code.
I guess.

91
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:13,411
...and I think we should follow it...

92
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:23,859
...in the most possible, ah strict,
as we possibly can.

93
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:36,770
What I mean is if we can prove
to the administration...

94
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:39,642
...that a dress code
really is a problem...

95
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:45,252
I mean just imagine everybody walking
around in those idiotic clothes.

96
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:48,950
Like Marty over here
is wearing right now.

97
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:52,995
And I mean everybody.

98
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,214
It would make them think that there
was some kind of a conspiracy.

99
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:09,177
Hey, she's bad news man.

100
00:12:12,788 --> 00:12:16,877
The debate and the game, I nailed the
guy, it was a shoe in, the election.

101
00:12:18,964 --> 00:12:23,446
Well I'm glad to see you're allowing yourself
some success without sabotaging it.

102
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:25,143
Let me ask you...

103
00:12:26,273 --> 00:12:30,449
...how do you feel about your family
in light of all these recent victories?

104
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:31,885
My family?

105
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:33,451
Yeah.

106
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:41,586
Ah, nothing.

107
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,370
I mean, I don't think about them,
they don't think about me, we're just...

108
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:49,329
...we're just one big happy family.

109
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:53,244
Except for a little incest and psychosis.

110
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:56,984
Look, I know you're being fishiest...

111
00:12:58,463 --> 00:13:00,725
...but I think you really believe that.

112
00:13:00,856 --> 00:13:01,943
No.

113
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:04,423
No, no, I don't.

114
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,816
We are getting along much better now.
Really.

115
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:08,947
Hey...

116
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:13,167
Let's not waste our time bullshitting.

117
00:13:13,514 --> 00:13:14,688
All right.

118
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:22,129
They don't approve of me, okay,
they don't accept my friends.

119
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,218
They don't talk to me like they do
Jenny.

120
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,176
And they don't even look like me!

121
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:34,613
I told you to teenagers sometimes feel alienated
from those closest to them.

122
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,224
I think I was adopted.

123
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,228
Don't you think
that sounds a little bit paranoid?

124
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:49,446
No, I've never been paranoid.

125
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,273
Just a little bit paranoid.

126
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,840
Within normal ranges.

127
00:13:56,885 --> 00:14:00,103
You know, you really deserve
what's going to happen to you.

128
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,366
What's going to happen?

129
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:05,672
You're going to make
a wonderful contribution to society.

130
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:18,210
Jenny!
Hey!

131
00:14:18,678 --> 00:14:20,636
I need some sun tan lotion!

132
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:24,421
Jenny!

133
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,335
Oh!

134
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:43,127
Listen, Jenny I'm just going...

135
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,748
God, Bill, what's the matter with you?

136
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:12,141
Get out of here!

137
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,970
I'm sorry, really,
I just came in here to get his.

138
00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:18,753
Get out of here!

139
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:44,073
- Most incredible product we've ever done!
- It was fabulous, did a terrific job

140
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:56,074
Bill?

141
00:15:57,425 --> 00:16:01,687
Ah, yes! The future student body
president of Beverly Hills Academy.

142
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,649
We're so excited about our party
for Judge Carter next week.

143
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:11,954
Well, I'm going to go to the beach today.

144
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:15,695
When will you be back, son?

145
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,566
- Well, that depends if we go out after...
- Don't be late, darling.

146
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:32,631
- I love that one, that's really good.
- That's the best product we've ever own.

147
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:34,662
It's absolutely terrific.

148
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:29,342
I love you, you know.

149
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:42,913
And, if you really loved me...

150
00:17:43,392 --> 00:17:46,698
...you'd get us invited
to Ted Ferguson's party.

151
00:17:46,828 --> 00:17:49,221
I can't believe we were left out!

152
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:56,181
Look, he's over there!

153
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,444
Come on, Billy Baby,
couldn't you just go talk to him?

154
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:02,010
Please?

155
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,311
Die, alien scum!

156
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:14,112
Jesus! Goddamnit! My hair!

157
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:19,847
Give me that!
Hey, get back here!

158
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:39,029
Don't get too hot.

159
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:25,140
Hey!

160
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,314
It's Whitney...

161
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:27,793
...the wonder boy!

162
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,316
Is this part of the beach dress code?

163
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:36,884
Hope you're not bent out of shape,
I'm captain of the debating team.

164
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:39,191
Hey, nothing you do can bend me.

165
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:42,452
Just remember Whitney we don't lose.

166
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:45,106
What are you going to do,
rig the election or something?

167
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:48,456
We don't have to.
Martin here was born to lead.

168
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:53,980
So, ah, you know
if anything's going on this week?

169
00:19:54,155 --> 00:19:55,285
This week?

170
00:19:58,548 --> 00:20:00,287
I can't think of anything.

171
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:06,162
- Well, if you do, let me know, huh.
- I'll send you a telegram.

172
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:17,082
- Yeah, let me know, huh?
- It's my pleasure.

173
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:28,259
Bill!

174
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:31,783
- Blanchard, what's up?
- I've got something you've got to hear.

175
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:35,262
- You were out of line with my sister.
- Oh god! Now look, I'm serious.

176
00:20:35,393 --> 00:20:37,436
This is very important.

177
00:20:37,741 --> 00:20:39,438
What are you talking about?

178
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:42,962
Not here,
Just come with me to the pier okay.

179
00:20:43,657 --> 00:20:44,702
Please!

180
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:56,579
...paragraph ten...

181
00:20:56,665 --> 00:20:58,405
Dad, something's wrong
with my earring.

182
00:20:58,536 --> 00:21:00,450
- Jenny!
- Oh hi, Judge Carter.

183
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:04,713
How is our newest confirmed member
of society this lovely afternoon?

184
00:21:05,191 --> 00:21:07,889
Oh, I'm fine, it's my earring that's not
doing so well.

185
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,630
I must say young lady you certainly
added beauty...

186
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:14,456
...to an altogether beautiful coming out
party. Don't you agree, Jim?

187
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,502
Prettiest girl there your honor.
Please, be seated.

188
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:24,419
Well, it's right in the back, by the claps.

189
00:21:25,768 --> 00:21:26,854
Oh, yes...

190
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,986
Seems to be something caught in there.

191
00:21:42,296 --> 00:21:44,080
Top Secret. Eh, Blanchard?

192
00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:52,954
Everybody in. All right girls,
don't forget your seatbelts.

193
00:21:53,282 --> 00:21:55,391
Wait a minute, that's my family!

194
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,400
Allright now Bill, I know you're going
to be a little upset about this but...

195
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,615
...I put a voice activated tape recorder
underneath your parents' car
and a microphone...

196
00:22:05,702 --> 00:22:09,051
Are you bugged my family!

197
00:22:09,182 --> 00:22:10,789
Just listen to the tape!

198
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:14,923
I remember my own coming out,
I was so excited!

199
00:22:15,052 --> 00:22:17,272
Then you can do it with women
as well as men?

200
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,099
- Of course!
- You know the schedule, first the dine,
then copulation.

201
00:22:21,187 --> 00:22:24,971
Someone your own age first,
then with your mother and me.

202
00:22:25,102 --> 00:22:27,972
Then in comes the host.

203
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,235
You know, I could hardly keep a straight
face when Bill apologized to me...

204
00:22:32,322 --> 00:22:33,757
...about not being able
to make it tonight.

205
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:38,238
Don't be concerned about your brother, Jen.
He's too busy with things in his own world
to worry about us.

206
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:45,547
You really lucked out, Jen!
Ted Ferguson is really cute!

207
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:47,243
Ted Ferguson?!

208
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,047
Yeah, Jenny and Ferguson.
That's just the beginning, here listen

209
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:54,900
Wow! Your boobs are totally sexy!

210
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:58,380
Guys are going to pop high ones
the second they see you.

211
00:22:58,554 --> 00:23:03,436
- I'm a little nervous about it.
- Oh relax Jenny! Just go with it!

212
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,439
It's so much fun
to see how far you can strech!

213
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:11,169
Yeah the hotter and wetter you get,
the more you can do, it's great!

214
00:23:16,215 --> 00:23:17,477
It's a microphone.

215
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,738
Let me see...

216
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:25,916
David Blanchard's been bothering
my daughter recently.

217
00:23:26,002 --> 00:23:28,396
Following her around, things like that...

218
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:33,179
He's a real electronics wizard.

219
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,094
Is that so, Jim?

220
00:23:40,197 --> 00:23:41,997
Oh, Ted you're wonderful!

221
00:23:48,196 --> 00:23:49,696
Oh, Ted! Oh my God!

222
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:52,797
Is that him?

223
00:24:09,697 --> 00:24:11,697
God! This is excellent!

224
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,331
What the hell are they doing?

225
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:21,378
Come on, you rigged it!

226
00:24:21,683 --> 00:24:24,555
What, you've been living with
these people all your life and you
don't know anything about this?!

227
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,511
Shut up!

228
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:30,705
Come on don't do it!

229
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:34,473
Here's your stupid recorder.

230
00:24:34,604 --> 00:24:36,082
Bill, wait!

231
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:45,479
Dr. Cleveland,
you got to listen this tape!

232
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,523
- Billy, something happen at home?
- I'm not crazy, this is real!

233
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:52,834
I can't right now, Billy,
but I'll be glad to listen to it later.

234
00:24:52,921 --> 00:24:54,169
No, now please.

235
00:24:54,256 --> 00:24:55,814
Billy, please, trust me...

236
00:24:56,032 --> 00:25:00,432
... I will call you just as soon as I listen to it
or I'll see you tomorrow.

237
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,747
No, it's okay Billy.

238
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,965
- Give me the tape.
- No!

239
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:06,968
You still don't trust me?

240
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:09,231
Are you still afraid of me?

241
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:14,579
Okay, it's up to you, Billy.

242
00:25:15,537 --> 00:25:18,017
If you want to bring
it tomorrow, it's okay.

243
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,280
I, I don't know why I'm afraid, but...

244
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:28,630
Doctor, it's very important.

245
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:30,805
I understand.

246
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:34,503
Listen to it.

247
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,599
Okay, Now listen...

248
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:54,382
Yesterday, after you left the beach,
I heard something.

249
00:25:54,557 --> 00:25:57,993
It involved my parents,
my sister and Ted Ferguson.

250
00:25:59,212 --> 00:26:01,299
He's not inviting us, is he?

251
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:03,300
I knew it!

252
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:07,085
Just listen to me for a minute here.
And stop worrying about that stupid party!

253
00:26:07,172 --> 00:26:10,086
It may seem stupid to you,
but I want to go.

254
00:26:10,391 --> 00:26:14,306
Is that all you think about?
Parties and social status?

255
00:26:14,436 --> 00:26:16,176
If you're having problems...

256
00:26:16,264 --> 00:26:18,613
...because you're
so big headed and selfish...

257
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,354
...no wonder
no one ever invites us anywhere!

258
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:22,919
Listen...

259
00:26:23,267 --> 00:26:27,487
I'm trying to tell you something you know?
You're doing is giving me a bunch of shit!

260
00:26:28,139 --> 00:26:31,532
Fine fine! That's just fine!

261
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,144
Is that how you feel about me?

262
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:38,188
Well, I'm just glad that I know it now,
rather than later.

263
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:40,363
I don't know, Billy...

264
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:43,539
Maybe we should start
seeing other people.

265
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,931
Wait a minute, Shauna!

266
00:26:47,931 --> 00:26:49,062
Shauna! Wait.

267
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,629
Oh! Man!

268
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,630
Hey, Bill!

269
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,935
Hi, Milo.

270
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,983
Hey dude, I see you got... Oh.

271
00:27:09,247 --> 00:27:12,075
- I'm very concerned about you, Billy.
- You listened to the tape?

272
00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:15,555
You're aware, aren't you,
that what you're doing is illegal?

273
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:17,687
Yeah, what about what they were
doing?

274
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,514
...my father...

275
00:27:21,385 --> 00:27:23,428
...my sister and my mother...

276
00:27:24,124 --> 00:27:25,298
...together?

277
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,086
Everybody in?

278
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:36,088
- Yes, Dad.
- All right girls, don't forget the seatbelts.

279
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,176
Fast forward a little bit.

280
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:48,223
Oh I remember my own coming out,
God, I was so excited!

281
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,460
You mean I can dance
with anyone I want?

282
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,061
Of course.

283
00:27:51,747 --> 00:27:53,617
I, what, I don't understand.

284
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:58,742
You know the schedule, first we dine,
then introductions, then you'll be presented.

285
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:00,361
No, ah, no.

286
00:28:01,577 --> 00:28:06,549
- Oh my god! It's so exciting!
- Don't worry, dear, we'll be there to help you.

287
00:28:06,607 --> 00:28:08,756
I felt really bad
that Bill couldn't come.

288
00:28:08,843 --> 00:28:10,583
I hope he doesn't fell left out.

289
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:14,935
We're very proud of your brother Jen, it's just
unfortunate that he couldn't be with us.

290
00:28:15,021 --> 00:28:16,805
That's not what I heard!

291
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,419
Bill!

292
00:28:30,506 --> 00:28:31,594
Billy!

293
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:35,553
People are what they are.

294
00:28:37,293 --> 00:28:39,640
Now you have to learn to accept that...

295
00:28:39,728 --> 00:28:43,294
...and you have to learn
to accept societies rules...

296
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:45,252
...of privacy.

297
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:50,169
If you don't follow the rules, Billy,
bad things happen.

298
00:28:51,256 --> 00:28:54,302
Some people make rules
and some people follow the rules.

299
00:28:54,388 --> 00:28:57,346
It's a question of what you're born to.

300
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:02,263
- I really hate giving you drugs!
- What?

301
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,308
I don't believe this!

302
00:29:05,396 --> 00:29:07,265
You can always trust me, Billy.

303
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,874
You got to believe me.

304
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:25,274
Blanchard, I need
another copy of this tape.

305
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,536
No, it can't wait!

306
00:29:28,493 --> 00:29:29,494
Yeah...

307
00:29:29,973 --> 00:29:32,931
The corner of Roxbury and Wilshire.
Right, okay hurry!

308
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:01,857
It's Blanchard.

309
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,091
Is he dead?

310
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,376
Hey!

311
00:31:21,028 --> 00:31:22,943
This isn't a garage sale.

312
00:31:23,378 --> 00:31:25,899
Look, officer. He was a friend.

313
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:30,511
Look! You can't just wander
into the scene of an accident.

314
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,732
- Look, officer, something is definitely wrong here.
- Get the hell out of here!

315
00:31:36,863 --> 00:31:39,560
- No, wait a minute, you don't understand...
- Get the hell out of here!

316
00:32:05,226 --> 00:32:07,662
Guess what,
telegram came for you.

317
00:32:09,532 --> 00:32:12,969
- Listen Jenny, something bad happened today.
- Come on! Don't you want to open it?

318
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,579
Go ahead, read it!

319
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25,886
"Mr. William Whitney...

320
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:31,064
...you're cordially invited to a
party to be given at the
residence of Theodore S. Ferguson..."

321
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:32,717
Wow!

322
00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:36,024
"...this evening 15th of October,
at eight PM.

323
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,938
Cordially attended, tycoon, Ferguson."

324
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:42,113
Sounds like some bash, son.

325
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:46,159
But be careful
on the drinking and driving.

326
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,725
That home is just beautiful!

327
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:53,990
Maurice Arno did most of the interiors
and he says it's his best work to date.

328
00:32:58,122 --> 00:32:59,992
You just don't understand.
I'm trying to tell you something.

329
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,456
We know all about the
automobile accident, son.

330
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:05,561
It's terrible, just terrible.

331
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:08,649
Oh, my! It's just awful.

332
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:15,305
I don't think
you quite understand here.

333
00:33:17,522 --> 00:33:18,915
David's dead!

334
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:24,353
- Jenny!
- I know, I'm really going to miss him.

335
00:33:25,091 --> 00:33:27,571
That's it, you're really going
to miss him?

336
00:33:29,095 --> 00:33:32,618
I know the guy freaked out after
you dumped him, but come on, still.

337
00:33:32,705 --> 00:33:35,401
Listen, I'd rather not talk about it.
Please.

338
00:33:39,926 --> 00:33:41,491
So, what are you going to wear?

339
00:33:42,275 --> 00:33:43,275
You mean to the funeral?

340
00:33:43,362 --> 00:33:45,842
No, you weirdo.
To the Ferguson's party!

341
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:48,496
Oh, Ferguson...

342
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:01,708
- Your name is Clarissa, isn't it?
- Uh huh.

343
00:35:04,884 --> 00:35:06,145
Clarissa Carlyn.

344
00:35:16,975 --> 00:35:18,280
So where is Shauna?

345
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:23,065
Well...

346
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:27,327
I didn't expect to see her here,
if that's what you mean.

347
00:35:29,851 --> 00:35:31,765
That is who
you're going out with right?

348
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:38,639
- Do you know my mom's maiden
name too? - Real or adopted?

349
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,945
Bill!
What happened with Blanchard?

350
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:43,207
Milo, Ferguson invited you?

351
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:44,598
Come on, give me a break.

352
00:35:44,946 --> 00:35:47,817
- I'm not in the mood, all right.
- Whatever turns you on.

353
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:50,646
At least don't turn tricks
to get my kicks.

354
00:35:59,346 --> 00:36:00,955
That was totally uncalled for.

355
00:36:01,043 --> 00:36:02,695
Well, have you seen her mother?

356
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:05,695
Wait, wait, listen, listen.
What happened today with Blanchard?

357
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,089
Hey, I asked you about Blanchard,
you saw it, didn't...

358
00:36:09,177 --> 00:36:11,831
I can't deal with that right now, okay?
I've got to go.

359
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:24,184
Well, Billy.

360
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:28,795
- We need to talk.
- I guess you got my telegram.

361
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,448
Sorry it was so much to last minute.

362
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:34,885
I want to talk to you about Blanchard
and my sister Jenny.

363
00:36:35,668 --> 00:36:37,452
I thought they broke up.

364
00:36:38,756 --> 00:36:40,801
He really wasn't her type anyway...

365
00:36:42,715 --> 00:36:44,585
You are so intense.

366
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:46,587
Just relax!

367
00:36:47,762 --> 00:36:49,023
Enjoy.

368
00:36:50,372 --> 00:36:51,981
I want to know
what happened to Blanchard!

369
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:54,593
And I want to know what you did
to my sister in her coming out?

370
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,287
You know the schedule,
first we dined...

371
00:36:58,462 --> 00:37:00,680
...then I fucked your sister!

372
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:05,074
And then everybody else
got so turned on, they fucked her too.

373
00:37:05,205 --> 00:37:07,422
And as far as that bagel breath
Blanchard goes...

374
00:37:07,554 --> 00:37:10,425
...I ran that low rent
fool right into a pole!

375
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:12,948
That was a pretty busy week,
don't you think?

376
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:22,562
You stupid!

377
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:31,219
You make waves within,
you're going to drown.

378
00:38:02,104 --> 00:38:03,583
Wet dreams?

379
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,194
You're crazy,
do you know what you just did?

380
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,543
No.

381
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,544
But I know what I'm about to.

382
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:13,326
Don't bother, it's his party.

383
00:38:13,935 --> 00:38:15,979
Some day it's going to be my party.

384
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:24,333
You're in a danger
of loosing this button here.

385
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,813
It's only held on by one thread.

386
00:38:30,204 --> 00:38:31,205
Oops!

387
00:38:32,293 --> 00:38:33,815
I told you!

388
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,122
You're weird.

389
00:38:38,323 --> 00:38:39,123
Wanna go get sex?

390
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,424
Umm, sure.

391
00:39:06,701 --> 00:39:08,833
Better get out of these wet things.

392
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:20,014
You're so fresh!

393
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:29,279
Are you sure no one's going come in?

394
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:33,282
We're all alone!

395
00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:45,113
Mean machine jelly bean.

396
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:48,941
Try to run now!

397
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:17,942
Clarissa?

398
00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:28,731
What's the matter, Billy?

399
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,299
You...

400
00:41:34,474 --> 00:41:36,386
...you were in a funny position!

401
00:41:37,257 --> 00:41:39,084
Billy, you are so sweet.

402
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:43,956
I wonder
when exactly you lost your virginity.

403
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,527
That's Bill's Jeep!!

404
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,135
It is.

405
00:41:53,396 --> 00:41:55,442
I can't believe he would do this to me.

406
00:41:55,528 --> 00:41:59,312
- Oh, come on, Shauna, it's better you
find out now, rather than wait, right? - No!

407
00:42:01,009 --> 00:42:03,749
God,
what a bitch that Clarissa Carlyn is!

408
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,577
- Can you imagine what's going on?
- All right.

409
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,886
How do you like your tea?
Cream? Sugar?

410
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,540
Or do you want me to pee in it?

411
00:42:23,325 --> 00:42:25,631
You're a class act, Clarissa!

412
00:42:37,593 --> 00:42:39,723
Oh, I'm so mad I could just scream!

413
00:42:42,203 --> 00:42:43,335
Who's that?

414
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,987
I don't know!

415
00:42:46,076 --> 00:42:48,164
- We better get out of here!
- Uh-uh!

416
00:43:00,165 --> 00:43:01,165
Oh, shit!

417
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:03,172
Clarissa!

418
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:19,222
Home a little early tonight,
don't you think so, mother?

419
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:23,746
Has that brain of yours
finally gone completely numb?

420
00:43:26,447 --> 00:43:28,047
Mrs. Carlyn, Bill Whitney.

421
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:40,800
Come on mother, out! Out!

422
00:43:42,148 --> 00:43:43,236
Out!

423
00:43:46,497 --> 00:43:47,890
What are you doing?

424
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,110
Lighten up Billy boy,
drink your tea before you drool.

425
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:56,372
So what's with her?

426
00:43:57,764 --> 00:43:59,983
She does things I don't like.

427
00:44:02,897 --> 00:44:05,332
I've never known anyone like you.

428
00:44:06,202 --> 00:44:08,683
It's about time you did honey bunny!

429
00:44:14,033 --> 00:44:15,775
It's getting late...

430
00:45:05,843 --> 00:45:08,366
- Shauna!
- So are you happy now?

431
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:11,628
- What do you mean?
- What a bitch that Clarissa Carlyn is!

432
00:45:11,715 --> 00:45:13,934
You think you can do
anything that you want?!

433
00:45:14,064 --> 00:45:16,977
- Calm down and let me explain.
- Was she a good fuck?!

434
00:45:17,065 --> 00:45:20,005
That's all you're really interested in,
isn't it, Billy?!

435
00:45:20,193 --> 00:45:22,372
No, look Shauna, let, ah...

436
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:26,331
Oh, Billy! How could you?

437
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:28,681
Ah, look, I...

438
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,160
Shauna!

439
00:45:58,479 --> 00:46:00,219
Yeah, right there dad, that's good!

440
00:46:01,784 --> 00:46:02,873
What's this?!

441
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,264
Oh, God! Bill!

442
00:46:05,308 --> 00:46:07,527
Is that thing what I think it is?

443
00:46:07,658 --> 00:46:11,007
That's a really disgusting thing
to bring into mom and dad's bedroom.

444
00:46:11,312 --> 00:46:13,876
I don't know what's going on here,
but I don't appreciate it!

445
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:17,358
- Calm down, Bill! - Some of us
have to go to school on time!

446
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,620
You know, you look really nice in a tie!

447
00:46:22,794 --> 00:46:23,926
Don't you think so, Jim?

448
00:46:24,405 --> 00:46:25,927
Yes, yes, he does!

449
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:28,538
Knock it off here!

450
00:46:29,276 --> 00:46:31,981
Why are you guys
doing this to me huh?!

451
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:33,930
Don't be so paranoid!

452
00:46:34,148 --> 00:46:35,193
Wait...

453
00:46:36,245 --> 00:46:37,424
I'm not paranoid!

454
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:40,230
Oh, don't be like that...

455
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,415
Come on, Bill, calm down.

456
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:48,316
You know, you'll make such a
great contribution to society.

457
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:52,332
You'll do our whole family proud.

458
00:46:56,596 --> 00:46:58,076
You guys disgust me.

459
00:47:01,163 --> 00:47:03,729
Don't be
disrespectful to your mother.

460
00:47:04,773 --> 00:47:07,991
My mother?
God knows where my mother is.

461
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:13,365
I won't tolerate this language
from you, young man.

462
00:47:13,866 --> 00:47:15,366
Fuck you, butthead.

463
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:18,040
Bill, how dare you
use the F word to your father.

464
00:47:18,258 --> 00:47:21,609
Oh gee, I'm sorry mom,
you prefer the word, copulation?

465
00:47:25,698 --> 00:47:27,829
You stay away from me,
don't touch me.

466
00:47:29,481 --> 00:47:33,137
- Do something with him.
- You don't have to do anything,
because I'm moving out.

467
00:47:33,266 --> 00:47:34,746
You can't do that.

468
00:48:05,934 --> 00:48:07,022
Oh, Blanchard...

469
00:48:10,327 --> 00:48:14,069
He looks really weird.
Not like himself at all.

470
00:48:17,113 --> 00:48:19,116
I think that is
what they always look like.

471
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:34,950
They ah, must have had to do
a lot of reconstructive stuff on him...

472
00:48:35,298 --> 00:48:36,299
Yeah.

473
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,100
Bill.

474
00:48:48,957 --> 00:48:50,697
It's imperative that I talk with you...

475
00:48:51,741 --> 00:48:53,568
...about your parents...

476
00:48:55,222 --> 00:48:56,832
...about him...

477
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:01,527
...about some things
that have been happening here lately...

478
00:49:04,051 --> 00:49:05,877
...Society.

479
00:49:06,052 --> 00:49:08,358
- What do you mean society?
- Not here.

480
00:49:09,749 --> 00:49:13,492
Meet me tonight at Franklin Canyon,
about nine, at the gate.

481
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:19,277
Petrie!

482
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:10,607
Hey!

483
00:50:37,231 --> 00:50:38,492
Petrie!

484
00:51:08,158 --> 00:51:09,246
Who's there?

485
00:51:52,095 --> 00:51:53,269
Who are you?

486
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:35,192
- Clarissa, what are you doing here?
- I live here.

487
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,017
Yeah, look, I just saw Petrie
with his neck cut.

488
00:53:38,105 --> 00:53:40,063
Poor baby,
I hope he didn't make a mess.

489
00:53:40,194 --> 00:53:41,368
Where's your father?

490
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,688
This isn't the one.

491
00:54:26,956 --> 00:54:29,568
I don't think we need the lab
to tell us there's no blood.

492
00:54:29,698 --> 00:54:31,958
Look officer, this isn't the car.

493
00:54:33,132 --> 00:54:35,569
- They must have taken it. I don't know.
- They?

494
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:38,223
What are you hopped up on?

495
00:54:38,614 --> 00:54:41,529
Look, I'm telling you,
someone killed Martin Petrie.

496
00:54:42,137 --> 00:54:44,227
Up against the car, kids.

497
00:54:49,142 --> 00:54:51,491
This isn't the car, okay, it was a Volvo...

498
00:54:51,577 --> 00:54:54,230
...not whatever this is
and there was a dead person in it.

499
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:56,798
Is it really this boring, being rich?

500
00:54:57,407 --> 00:54:59,494
You are going to frisk me, too?

501
00:54:59,581 --> 00:55:02,800
I guess you're just naturally fucked up.

502
00:55:07,064 --> 00:55:10,935
Next time I see you,
it will be a lot less pleasant.

503
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,639
What now?

504
00:55:26,205 --> 00:55:28,814
- You can go home with me.
- I'm not in the mood, all right.

505
00:55:28,901 --> 00:55:31,075
Hey, that's not what I meant.

506
00:55:59,918 --> 00:56:03,484
We'll have the presidential debate
in a moment.

507
00:56:04,397 --> 00:56:08,705
Why didn't you come home last night?
Mom and dad are really upset.

508
00:56:09,313 --> 00:56:11,749
Jenny,
do you have anything to tell me?

509
00:56:14,229 --> 00:56:15,490
What do you want me to say?

510
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:20,277
Come on, I swear it,
it'll be just between you and me.

511
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:22,147
Just tell me the truth.

512
00:56:22,275 --> 00:56:24,538
- About what?
- You know what.

513
00:56:26,017 --> 00:56:28,409
You know,
I'm really worried about you.

514
00:56:29,584 --> 00:56:31,803
Yeah, you are.

515
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:34,674
Pipe down!

516
00:56:36,066 --> 00:56:37,110
Thank you.

517
00:56:40,373 --> 00:56:41,546
Where's Petrie?

518
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:45,724
It's strange
that Martin Petrie isn't here.

519
00:56:46,593 --> 00:56:48,073
He's never late.

520
00:56:49,204 --> 00:56:52,509
He's won every attendance award,
but he's not coming here.

521
00:56:54,814 --> 00:56:56,163
So please.

522
00:56:57,426 --> 00:57:00,599
David Blanchard's death
was no accident.

523
00:57:03,689 --> 00:57:05,733
David Blanchard tried...

524
00:57:05,907 --> 00:57:10,475
...tried to tell me about the society
that kills to keep its existence a secret.

525
00:57:11,129 --> 00:57:12,869
They killed Blanchard.

526
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:15,262
Martin Petrie...

527
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:18,956
...tried to tell me about this society...

528
00:57:19,044 --> 00:57:21,175
...but they got to him before I did.

529
00:57:21,263 --> 00:57:24,701
I saw Petrie last night
in Franklin Canyon...

530
00:57:25,831 --> 00:57:26,832
...murdered.

531
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,049
Martin Petrie is dead!

532
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:39,445
Someone like to tell me
what's going on here?

533
00:57:40,447 --> 00:57:42,666
I had car trouble.

534
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,232
Nice speech, Whitney!

535
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:50,758
Bill!

536
00:58:01,675 --> 00:58:04,066
- Bill, we got to talk.
- Leave me alone, Milo!

537
00:58:04,198 --> 00:58:06,459
I fucked you up man, and I'm sorry.

538
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:08,896
- I didn't think you'd take it this far.
- What do you mean?

539
00:58:10,376 --> 00:58:14,333
I mean, I was the one who put the
shrunken head in your locker...

540
00:58:14,419 --> 00:58:17,812
...and the sex doll in your Jeep,
but I didn't think you'd flip out.

541
00:58:18,205 --> 00:58:22,638
You. You. Petrie, Ferguson,
who else was in on this, huh?

542
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:23,639
Who else, asshole?

543
00:58:23,425 --> 00:58:27,253
Just give me a chance to explain, I'm
trying to tell you, you son of a bitch...

544
00:58:27,384 --> 00:58:30,952
...but you got your own answers,
as usual. I'm not in on anything...

545
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,474
...but I followed you
to Franklin Canyon last night.

546
00:58:33,561 --> 00:58:36,258
I saw Petrie and Ferguson
coming out from the wood.

547
00:58:36,344 --> 00:58:40,739
Petrie was wrapped in a blanket, then
some old station wagon showed up...

548
00:58:40,826 --> 00:58:44,045
...then an old Ford.
The whole thing was weird.

549
00:58:48,743 --> 00:58:50,221
You, you saw it?

550
00:58:52,092 --> 00:58:55,746
I only followed you
because of the way you were acting.

551
00:58:56,746 --> 00:58:59,705
Oh, then it's not me,
I mean I'm not goin crazy here.

552
00:58:59,835 --> 00:59:01,141
Right!

553
00:59:03,447 --> 00:59:05,970
Why the dolls and stuff?

554
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:10,492
I don't know, you just go me angry.

555
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:13,276
You know, I'm your best friend
when it suits you.

556
00:59:14,408 --> 00:59:17,192
I guess I do go a little overboard.

557
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:20,846
I'm sorry.

558
00:59:23,587 --> 00:59:24,979
It's all right man.
It's all right.

559
00:59:28,154 --> 00:59:32,896
I don't know what kind of trouble
this is going to be.

560
00:59:34,462 --> 00:59:35,723
I'm with you.

561
01:00:12,046 --> 01:00:15,047
Why doesn't it surprise me
that you're all here like this?

562
01:00:15,264 --> 01:00:18,790
Thank God you're here!
You nearly spoiled everything.

563
01:00:27,446 --> 01:00:29,186
We've been worried sick about you.

564
01:00:29,272 --> 01:00:31,579
Look, I would really love
to stay and shoot the shit...

565
01:00:31,665 --> 01:00:34,711
...but I got a big day tomorrow,
so I'm going to go to bed.

566
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,886
Now wait.

567
01:00:37,755 --> 01:00:40,235
Wait a minute, Bill.
We want to talk to you for a second.

568
01:00:40,365 --> 01:00:42,322
I don't think so
Wait...

569
01:00:42,497 --> 01:00:44,281
Let go of me!

570
01:00:45,237 --> 01:00:46,717
What do you think you're doing?

571
01:00:47,195 --> 01:00:49,543
Yuo know how I hate to give you drugs.

572
01:00:49,674 --> 01:00:51,328
You can't do this to me.

573
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:53,720
I have rights, I'm almost eighteen.

574
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:57,680
Thanks, Cleave.

575
01:02:04,278 --> 01:02:05,277
Excuse me.

576
01:02:05,582 --> 01:02:06,627
Miss!

577
01:02:08,067 --> 01:02:10,585
Bill...
William Whitney, what room is he in?

578
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:23,543
I don't see
anything here about a Whitney.

579
01:02:23,635 --> 01:02:25,810
I know he's here,
he was just brought in.

580
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:27,724
Just a minute.

581
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:52,737
- William Whitney?
- Yeah.

582
01:02:54,259 --> 01:02:55,781
Are you a relative?

583
01:02:56,086 --> 01:02:57,131
Yes!

584
01:02:57,913 --> 01:03:00,131
Well, you'll have to go
to the morgue then.

585
01:03:00,262 --> 01:03:01,262
The morgue?

586
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:04,265
He isn't dead, he Just got here.

587
01:03:04,395 --> 01:03:07,919
- Well, I'm sorry.
- No, you're not sorry.

588
01:03:08,049 --> 01:03:09,092
There's been a mistake.

589
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:12,355
Please, we don't want
to have to call security.

590
01:03:13,226 --> 01:03:14,530
He can't be.

591
01:03:54,726 --> 01:03:58,466
I'm sorry, you know
how I hate to give you drugs.

592
01:04:01,077 --> 01:04:04,296
You know the schedule,
first we dine, then copulation.

593
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:06,340
Someone your age first.

594
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,472
Then your sister.

595
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:14,910
You know you'll make
such a great contribution to society.

596
01:04:24,132 --> 01:04:25,480
Blanchard!

597
01:04:28,351 --> 01:04:30,484
- Oh oh.
- Let's get this one out of here.

598
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:32,354
- Yes, doctor.
- Easy, easy now.

599
01:05:24,642 --> 01:05:29,035
That's right. Roll out the red carpet,
Bill Whitney never disappointed huh?

600
01:05:33,343 --> 01:05:35,039
They said you were dead.

601
01:05:35,213 --> 01:05:38,081
Things are just the way they seem,
only more so, Milo.

602
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:41,040
What happened in there?

603
01:05:41,128 --> 01:05:44,868
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing, I'm here, aren't I?

604
01:05:45,172 --> 01:05:47,348
I won, Milo. I'm free.

605
01:05:47,783 --> 01:05:50,654
They couldn't handle Whitney,
the wonder boy.

606
01:05:51,133 --> 01:05:53,308
Bullshit, it's a set up.

607
01:05:54,135 --> 01:05:57,005
- They even brought your Jeep here.
- Come on!

608
01:05:57,091 --> 01:05:59,310
They just want me to be happy.

609
01:06:00,529 --> 01:06:01,703
Bill...

610
01:06:02,182 --> 01:06:03,922
You're officially dead.

611
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:08,882
Come on, can't you see
they're setting you up for something?

612
01:06:11,536 --> 01:06:12,796
Paranoia?

613
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:16,364
I'm not paranoid, all my fears are real.

614
01:06:24,803 --> 01:06:26,935
Let's party, Jelly bean.

615
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:31,721
Where's your mom?
Or is she in on this too?

616
01:06:31,851 --> 01:06:33,502
Why don't you come upstairs?

617
01:06:33,806 --> 01:06:35,113
I want to be a bad...

618
01:06:35,243 --> 01:06:38,083
Bad little girl, now right huh?
Bad little girl?

619
01:06:38,896 --> 01:06:40,942
Come on, you want to get rough?

620
01:06:41,116 --> 01:06:43,419
- Things aren't the way they seem, Billy.
- Oh, yeah?

621
01:06:46,073 --> 01:06:47,901
Why don't you stay here a while?

622
01:06:51,902 --> 01:06:53,164
Yes, stay a while.

623
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:57,123
Quit it!

624
01:06:57,297 --> 01:06:58,689
It doesn't work anymore.

625
01:07:00,386 --> 01:07:01,821
Don't go home, Billy.

626
01:07:02,256 --> 01:07:05,693
Don't go home? Are you kidding me,
they want me home.

627
01:07:05,824 --> 01:07:07,651
It's time to party hardy.

628
01:07:15,829 --> 01:07:17,526
Where are we going? What's the plan?

629
01:07:17,613 --> 01:07:18,744
Plan?

630
01:07:18,917 --> 01:07:20,266
You kidding?

631
01:07:34,796 --> 01:07:35,795
Ah shit!

632
01:07:37,188 --> 01:07:38,624
Mrs. Carlyn!

633
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:40,233
Don't do that!

634
01:07:41,581 --> 01:07:43,408
Get out of the car!

635
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:46,625
Okay.

636
01:07:47,018 --> 01:07:48,975
We're going to take a little ride.

637
01:07:51,021 --> 01:07:52,978
But don't touch the hair.

638
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:50,560
Mom? Dad?

639
01:10:44,588 --> 01:10:45,718
Mom...

640
01:10:45,806 --> 01:10:46,850
Dad...

641
01:10:46,937 --> 01:10:48,895
What happened to you?

642
01:11:22,564 --> 01:11:23,913
Wonderful!

643
01:11:24,348 --> 01:11:27,785
Wonderful!
Everyone was just wonderful.

644
01:11:30,089 --> 01:11:33,614
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Judge Carter!

645
01:11:50,012 --> 01:11:51,840
My dear!

646
01:11:53,493 --> 01:11:57,364
You are both absolutely brilliant!

647
01:12:01,585 --> 01:12:03,760
Well done, well done indeed.

648
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:06,237
Effective...

649
01:12:07,326 --> 01:12:08,674
...efficient.

650
01:12:10,544 --> 01:12:12,850
And to say the very least...

651
01:12:13,024 --> 01:12:14,330
...entertaining.

652
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:19,245
I do love the...

653
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:24,638
... smell of the hunt
and the taste of the shunt.

654
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:32,165
What's going on?

655
01:12:32,295 --> 01:12:33,688
You see, Bill...

656
01:12:35,645 --> 01:12:37,341
...it's like this...

657
01:12:39,386 --> 01:12:42,128
...there's no business
like show business.

658
01:12:47,215 --> 01:12:48,348
Who are you?

659
01:12:50,609 --> 01:12:52,610
I'm not your mother.

660
01:12:53,306 --> 01:12:56,569
Jesus, Bill...
you never were one of us.

661
01:12:58,657 --> 01:13:00,049
Who are you?!

662
01:13:00,615 --> 01:13:02,701
You almost understand, don't you?

663
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:09,271
You're a different race from us,
a different species, a different class.

664
01:13:11,446 --> 01:13:13,577
You're not one of us.

665
01:13:15,274 --> 01:13:17,449
You have to be born into the society.

666
01:13:18,712 --> 01:13:20,058
Alien scum!

667
01:13:21,364 --> 01:13:22,451
No.

668
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:25,463
We are not from outer space
or anyhing like that.

669
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:29,891
We have been here
as long as you have.

670
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:36,154
It's a matter of good breeding, really.

671
01:13:37,068 --> 01:13:38,502
Alien scum!

672
01:15:15,031 --> 01:15:16,858
Clarissa, where have you been?

673
01:15:19,033 --> 01:15:20,641
You're late!

674
01:15:27,821 --> 01:15:29,430
You've done very well, James.

675
01:15:29,517 --> 01:15:32,300
I'm pleased to be able to contribute.

676
01:15:33,823 --> 01:15:35,432
Anything for society.

677
01:15:35,955 --> 01:15:39,348
You too, young man.
You have a bright future for you.

678
01:15:39,956 --> 01:15:43,350
We may have an internship for you
this summer in Washington.

679
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:07,492
Come on!

680
01:16:21,196 --> 01:16:22,806
Come on, Mrs. Carlyn!

681
01:16:23,415 --> 01:16:25,066
You're going to be my date.

682
01:16:27,285 --> 01:16:30,553
Jenny is going to Radcliff,
she'll tour Europe first of course.

683
01:16:31,767 --> 01:16:34,854
Oh, Nanny!
You're such a lucky woman.

684
01:16:36,116 --> 01:16:42,206
Jenny is a real beauty.
She possesses such natural poise.

685
01:16:43,161 --> 01:16:46,991
Yes, Jim and I both derive
a great deal of pleasure for her.

686
01:16:49,426 --> 01:16:50,775
Don't we, darling?

687
01:17:13,918 --> 01:17:15,397
Ladies and gentlemen...

688
01:17:16,441 --> 01:17:20,225
Tonight we have a double header.

689
01:17:23,749 --> 01:17:25,141
Blanchard!

690
01:17:29,056 --> 01:17:31,015
After the first shunting...

691
01:17:32,144 --> 01:17:36,365
...we'll have that special treating
we've been hearing so much about.

692
01:17:37,496 --> 01:17:40,692
A wonderful specimen, in his prime...

693
01:17:43,802 --> 01:17:46,021
...nurtured by Jim and Nan...

694
01:17:46,891 --> 01:17:48,935
...in their very own home.

695
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:18,038
Keep your eye on Blanchard,
Billy boy...

696
01:18:18,255 --> 01:18:19,604
...because you're the next.

697
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:24,737
What are you doing?

698
01:18:26,438 --> 01:18:27,438
No...

699
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:32,939
Oh, god... Please...

700
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:39,265
Let go of me!

701
01:19:19,266 --> 01:19:20,366
Jim!

702
01:19:21,505 --> 01:19:22,507
Jenny!

703
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:34,816
Good bye, David!

704
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:49,910
Stop it.

705
01:19:50,345 --> 01:19:53,520
You're not losing your taste
for these pathetic animals, are you?

706
01:19:54,653 --> 01:19:55,762
Don't worry.

707
01:19:55,992 --> 01:19:57,959
You'll get your share.

708
01:19:59,046 --> 01:20:00,830
We all gonna get our share.

709
01:20:01,526 --> 01:20:04,441
- What's going on?
- Didn't you know, Billy boy?

710
01:20:04,702 --> 01:20:08,356
The rich have always sucked off
low class shit like you.

711
01:20:22,981 --> 01:20:25,016
There it is.

712
01:20:28,277 --> 01:20:30,844
Hey, what are you doing in there?

713
01:20:31,453 --> 01:20:34,412
This is a private party.
And private property.

714
01:20:34,498 --> 01:20:35,673
To members only.

715
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,327
- We're invited.
- You're invited? Who's that?

716
01:20:38,545 --> 01:20:40,024
This is my mother.

717
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:41,329
That's your mother.

718
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:43,677
Hair.

719
01:20:43,764 --> 01:20:45,591
Hair, Mrs. Carlyn!

720
01:21:18,132 --> 01:21:19,959
Good and pliable, your honor.

721
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:32,960
Oh, no!

722
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:43,058
Look.

723
01:21:44,078 --> 01:21:45,623
A beauty mark.

724
01:21:46,524 --> 01:21:47,724
Pretty isn't it?

725
01:21:48,865 --> 01:21:50,600
Oh, please.

726
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,417
And now...

727
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:15,248
...we'll get to the bottom.

728
01:22:15,932 --> 01:22:16,982
Oh God!

729
01:22:44,521 --> 01:22:45,696
Run, Billy!

730
01:22:47,089 --> 01:22:48,306
I love you.

731
01:22:55,135 --> 01:22:56,354
Billy!

732
01:23:14,189 --> 01:23:15,450
Where are you?

733
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:21,497
Where are you, Billy?
Anyone around my station is, I see it.

734
01:23:26,152 --> 01:23:28,022
It's showtime, Billy!

735
01:23:29,067 --> 01:23:32,415
You want to play, huh?

736
01:23:35,809 --> 01:23:36,809
You...

737
01:23:37,071 --> 01:23:38,028
You...

738
01:23:41,682 --> 01:23:44,162
Let me give you a hand, Bill.

739
01:24:01,823 --> 01:24:02,868
Mom?

740
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:13,088
Oh, Billy! How sweet of you,
to come here to me.

741
01:24:40,017 --> 01:24:42,974
Do you have any edible fantasies,
you'd like to indulge in Billy?

742
01:24:43,061 --> 01:24:44,757
Now is the time.

743
01:24:54,641 --> 01:24:58,853
Well, son, I guess you're right,
I am a butthead.

744
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:04,629
Hey, hey, hey, Bill?

745
01:25:16,309 --> 01:25:18,907
This isn't another hang up, Billy.

746
01:26:33,509 --> 01:26:36,337
Hi, everybody!
Here comes Billy.

747
01:26:36,819 --> 01:26:38,064
Let go of me!

748
01:26:41,513 --> 01:26:43,732
Billy on the half shell.

749
01:26:45,473 --> 01:26:46,503
Billy!

750
01:26:48,257 --> 01:26:49,606
Leave her alone.

751
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,477
Well, well, well, what do we have here,
you're going to rescue
the young maiden Billy?

752
01:26:56,478 --> 01:26:57,478
Something like that.

753
01:26:59,697 --> 01:27:01,872
You and me, man to man.

754
01:27:03,437 --> 01:27:05,829
Well, a slave revolt.

755
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:15,830
I love it you gotta save the girl,
it's so cute.

756
01:27:17,010 --> 01:27:18,967
Billy don't,
you'll only make it worse.

757
01:27:19,097 --> 01:27:20,186
Shut up, Clarissa.

758
01:27:20,272 --> 01:27:22,752
Jim! Nan! Where the hell are you?

759
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:23,348
We got to pull myself together.

760
01:28:27,436 --> 01:28:29,051
A beauty mark.

761
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,967
I'm getting too old for this.

762
01:28:53,284 --> 01:28:57,563
Nan! Jim! Come on,
you guys, knock it off, will you?

763
01:28:57,564 --> 01:29:00,264
You've gotta come downstairs.
You've gotta see this.

764
01:29:00,349 --> 01:29:03,924
- We're changing!
- Oh really? Into what?

765
01:29:07,327 --> 01:29:09,459
Members of society...

766
01:29:10,938 --> 01:29:13,461
...hailing from Beverly Hills...

767
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:18,769
...with lineage dating from Julius
Caesar and Gengis Khan...

768
01:29:20,073 --> 01:29:23,901
...the master of the hunt,
the champion of the shunt...

769
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:27,206
...Ted the Tycoon Ferguson!

770
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:37,386
In this corner...

771
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:41,996
...from nowhere in particular...

772
01:29:43,823 --> 01:29:47,043
...Bill the Bastard Whitney!

773
01:29:48,957 --> 01:29:50,306
Gentlemen...

774
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:51,785
...begin!

775
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:06,140
Everybody ready
for the dessert of the night?

776
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:14,928
Ferguson!

777
01:31:06,429 --> 01:31:07,929
Bill! Bill!

778
01:31:17,655 --> 01:31:21,612
See this arm, Bill,
you can get very familiar with it.

779
01:31:42,362 --> 01:31:43,494
Oh, shit!

780
01:31:47,088 --> 01:31:48,676
Is that all you got?

781
01:31:49,288 --> 01:31:51,933
Come on, gummy.
Give me your best shot.

782
01:31:55,153 --> 01:31:58,067
All right Billy, the game's over.

783
01:32:17,946 --> 01:32:22,631
I told you Whitney, we don't lose, ever.

784
01:33:18,913 --> 01:33:21,066
It's turned inside out.

785
01:33:31,067 --> 01:33:32,067
Clarissa!

786
01:33:37,557 --> 01:33:39,092
Bill, come on man!

787
01:33:48,341 --> 01:33:50,037
You'll never get away with this.

788
01:33:55,518 --> 01:33:56,693
Don't count on it.

789
01:34:02,130 --> 01:34:03,267
Butthead!

790
01:34:08,743 --> 01:34:10,005
Come on! Come on!

791
01:34:40,498 --> 01:34:44,412
Well Dr. Cleveland, it looks
so I may have an opening...

792
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:48,894
...in Washington next summer.
Know what I mean?
