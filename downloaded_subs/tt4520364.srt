1
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,496
Hi, darling. It's me.

2
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,917
I thought we'd have lunch
together today.

3
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,599
Oh, angel, you look sad.

4
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,807
You know, it's a very,
very natural thing.

5
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,600
It's actually a very
human thing to feel sad.

6
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,478
But emotions aren't bad.

7
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,154
I'm sorry, baby.

8
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:11,947
I'm still trying to get them to change
their mind and let you out for a little bit.

9
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,330
No! Get off!

10
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,792
No!

11
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,377
Oh, god!

12
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,298
Morgan. Calm...
Hey. Calm down, please.

13
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,341
Hey, Morgan.

14
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,421
It's okay.

15
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:56,411
Remote access brief for synsect.

16
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,370
Morgan

17
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,040
case number 6b1138.

18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,130
Audio ID. Please identify.

19
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,250
Lee weathers.

20
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,305
Risk management.

21
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,877
Access granted.

22
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,931
Please stand by.

23
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,548
Good day, miss weathers.

24
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,717
Sorry for the short notice...

25
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,185
...but we really appreciate
your urgent response on this.

26
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,606
As you can see from the flash report,
details are sketchy.

27
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:32,569
We do know there was an incident
involving the I-9 prototype...

28
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,571
...at one of our off-site labs.

29
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,905
Normally, we would send
a security team...

30
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,160
...but given the extreme sensitivity
of the l-series genetic research...

31
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:46,543
...we feel it best to exert
a light touch here.

32
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,837
We don't want another Helsinki.

33
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,130
Keep the project staff on-site...

34
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,683
...and make your assessment
following the psych eval.

35
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:01,314
Dr. Ben Shapiro from psych tech
will join you to interview the subject.

36
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,189
Synsect has invested
significant capital...

37
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,017
...in the I-series product, and, well...

38
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:11,613
...let's just say these folks
have been holed up for quite a while.

39
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,690
Shortleaf.

40
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,034
Lee weathers. I'm expected.

41
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,701
The faculty are a close-knit group...

42
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,828
...so it's very possible
they've drifted off...

43
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,538
...the original project brief.

44
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:26,158
Update me following initial contact.

45
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,206
Confirmed. Delete file.

46
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,601
Miss Weathers.

47
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,892
Ted Brenner.

48
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,145
I'm the project manager.
We spoke online.

49
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,228
Nice to meet you.

50
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,022
Let me help you with your luggage.

51
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,356
Did you find the place okay?

52
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,403
I did.

53
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,125
I don't know if you've
already been informed,

54
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,737
but we just got word
that Dr. shapiro has been detained.

55
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,873
Yes, I've been informed.

56
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,452
It's unfortunate, I know.

57
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,866
He should be here
early tomorrow morning,

58
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,326
so, if you don't mind waiting...

59
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,165
I guess I don't really have
much of a choice.

60
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,086
This way, please.

61
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,852
You have your own bathroom
with a shower.

62
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,604
Hot water is ample here.

63
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,390
I'd be happy to give you a tour
of the facilities if you'd like.

64
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,773
I'd actually like to meet
with Dr. Cheng and Dr. ziegler.

65
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,034
Absolutely. They're eager to meet you.

66
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,107
And Kathy grieff.

67
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,569
Kathy...

68
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,906
I haven't checked in
on her today, but...

69
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,028
As soon as you do,
let her know I'd like to see her.

70
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,665
-Of course.
-And Morgan.

71
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,665
As soon as possible.

72
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,874
I will be sure
to let Dr. ziegler know.

73
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,838
I think you'll see the results
of our investment,

74
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,707
despite the current setbacks,

75
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,259
are quite remarkable.

76
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,092
Thank you, Ted.

77
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,144
Yes.

78
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:12,405
This is Lee.

79
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,691
You're clear to get started.

80
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,231
This is not just about the l-9.

81
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,237
Someone has really screwed up.

82
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:22,238
Use today to take
a closer look at the team.

83
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,281
Of course.

84
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,529
After shapiro's analysis tomorrow,

85
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,116
I'll have a more complete picture.

86
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,125
I also hope to see Morgan today.

87
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,705
I may need to press the issue.

88
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,001
Be cautious, miss weathers.

89
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,090
Make sure
all safety protocols are in place.

90
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,591
But above all, preserve the asset.

91
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,552
To confirm, I'm acting
on your full authority?

92
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,809
Absolutely, miss weathers.

93
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,848
Good.

94
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,566
-Hi.
-Hi.

95
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,201
I'm Amy.

96
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,077
The behaviorist.

97
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,709
That's right.

98
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:14,827
I just reviewed your paper
on cnt in hybridized neuro-tech,

99
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,045
and it was very impressive.

100
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,634
Oh, thank you. But, I mean...

101
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,169
That was an old paper.

102
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,924
I can't even remember what I wrote.

103
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,335
You seem to have managed
to put a lot of it into practice.

104
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,474
I'll take your word for it.

105
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,063
You know, you're nowhere
near as scary as I imagined.

106
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,190
I'd love to chat more, but I'm
in the middle of getting settled.

107
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,901
I'll get out of your hair.

108
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,189
Boundary issues, right?

109
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,071
Is that what it says in my file?

110
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,989
-Something like that.
-Yeah.

111
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,278
You probably know
more about me than I do.

112
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,696
I wouldn't say that.

113
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,582
Look, I get it.

114
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,250
Okay, you have a job to do,
just like everybody else here.

115
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,331
Look, if you ever
need anything from me,

116
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,212
don't hesitate to ask.

117
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,674
I appreciate that. Thank you.

118
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,670
They tell you dinner's at 8:00?

119
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,089
Skip's making a lasagna.

120
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,885
Everybody loves lasagna, right?

121
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,484
Right.

122
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,664
Hey, there.

123
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,416
You're skip.

124
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,249
Right. You're...

125
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,674
The consultant from corporate.

126
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,507
Well, I am the nutritionist
and general kitchen monkey,

127
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,430
so if you need anything, let me know.

128
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,637
Do you need anything? Water?

129
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,928
Beer? Maybe a protein shake?

130
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,230
No. I'm good. Thank you.

131
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,019
My glorious contribution to science.

132
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,529
You hunt?

133
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,942
Oh, yeah.
We're farm fresh around here.

134
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:06,986
I'm not a half bad shot.

135
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,704
There you are.

136
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,319
-I see you've met skip.
-I have.

137
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,236
Well, Dr. ziegler is just
finishing up a spot of work.

138
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,826
But I thought
we might pop in on Kathy.

139
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,043
Nice to meet you.

140
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,292
Nice to meet you.

141
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,380
Kathy, Brenda,
this is Lee weathers from corporate.

142
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,718
Dr. Finch.

143
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,718
Kathy, I'd love to have a chat.

144
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,142
I'm up for anything.

145
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:39,392
I told bren, I told the doc.

146
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,056
Hell, I told everybody. I don't need
to be in this goddamn bed.

147
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,935
But nobody seems to
want to listen to me, so...

148
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,439
She's just been medicated.

149
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,146
I'd like to speak with her in private.

150
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,656
She needs her rest.

151
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,907
It won't take too long.

152
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,239
It's fine.

153
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,367
We'll be right outside.

154
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,168
How are you feeling?

155
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,723
I look worse than I feel.

156
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,682
I can promise you that.

157
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:18,274
Look, this wasn't Morgan's fault.

158
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,975
It was my fault. Really.

159
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,937
I was, like...

160
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,321
Careless.

161
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,280
She was in a mood.

162
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,320
The company doesn't have to
worry about me. Really.

163
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,365
We are worried.

164
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,873
Any time an employee is in danger.

165
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,990
No, I don't...

166
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,906
That's not... I mean,
it was my mistake.

167
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,090
I shouldn't have confused her.

168
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,588
Morgan's not a "she."

169
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
It's an "it."

170
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,929
Oh, you're wrong about that,
miss weathers.

171
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,180
She's smart.

172
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,904
She's smarter than any of us.

173
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,767
But that's not what makes
Morgan special.

174
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,277
There was joy in her heart

175
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,315
before we shoved her back in that box.

176
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,569
You haven't met her?

177
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,242
Not yet.

178
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,454
You'll see.

179
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,575
You will. You really will.

180
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,037
Nothing here is a foregone conclusion.

181
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,343
I'm just looking for some answers.
Some information.

182
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,013
You're a liar.

183
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,015
There's a smile on your face, but...

184
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,306
I can tell what you are.

185
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,982
You're a goddamned assassin.

186
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,280
Get better soon.

187
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,161
No, I'm sorry.

188
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,251
It's these lousy drugs.
I'm not myself.

189
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,077
She's a good girl.

190
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,799
She just got it all mixed up,
just for a moment.

191
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,756
It can happen to anyone.

192
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,090
It can.

193
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,469
Feel better.

194
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:42,827
Dr. ziegler.

195
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:44,754
Miss weathers.

196
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,038
Pleasure.

197
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,581
Yes, absolutely.

198
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,917
It's unfortunate your stay
has been needlessly extended.

199
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,381
That's okay, doctor. We'll adjust.

200
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,761
Why don't you get me up to speed?

201
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,006
Yes. Please.

202
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,836
The creation of synthetic DNA

203
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,847
was the relatively simple half
of the equation.

204
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:06,432
The second half is where
it gets a little more tricky.

205
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,190
Like a magician,

206
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,019
we tricked the neural network
into accepting

207
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,725
our nano into its ranks,

208
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,991
to alight in its midst.

209
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,818
Then during the incubation period,

210
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,118
the nano begins to introduce
its own language,

211
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:23,994
its own commands.

212
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,456
The growth rate of the organism

213
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:33,133
gradually accelerates as it reacts to
and reproduces the new stimuli.

214
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,210
Yes, I have read the material, doctor.

215
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,930
Yes. Of course.

216
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:45,887
Well, as you know,
Morgan was our third attempt.

217
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:53,153
Our first full-term subject developed
internal features externally.

218
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,650
It's not working. It's dropping.

219
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,898
It expired not long after
its so-called birth.

220
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:00,947
No.

221
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,583
And then the second...

222
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,658
It exhibited more complete
physical growth,

223
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:10,173
but it was plagued by mental issues
in its development.

224
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,077
This only strengthened our decision

225
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,295
to start with a more
emotionally cognitive specimen.

226
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,629
Then,

227
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:22,506
after two years, we finally had our...

228
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,262
Our little breakthrough.

229
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,275
Yes!

230
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,183
Hi.

231
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,359
We knew right away
that Morgan was very special.

232
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,608
Very alert, very responsive.

233
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:40,987
You are!

234
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,953
Her intelligence grew steadily.

235
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,286
Advanced comprehension, growth rate.

236
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,207
-Are you ready?
-Within a month, walking and talking.

237
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,081
She was exactly what we intended,

238
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:57,086
a hybrid biological organism

239
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,169
with the capacity for
autonomous decision-making

240
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,505
and sophisticated emotional responses.

241
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:04,587
No, Morgan. Come back!

242
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:11,432
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you!

243
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,056
Morgan, look over here.

244
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,942
Look at this! Do you see? What's that?

245
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,492
I got three.

246
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,408
Isn't it amazing?
Like a nice little...

247
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,344
It's her first birth...

248
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,837
Its first birthday.

249
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:41,666
It exceeded our...

250
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,799
Our wildest expectations.

251
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,102
A great day.

252
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,137
Special day.

253
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,602
I'd like to discuss
the incident, if that's okay.

254
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:56,187
Yes.

255
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,727
What would you like to know?

256
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,995
I'm still unclear on the cause.

257
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:04,987
Yes.

258
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,663
There had been some debate

259
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,871
on Morgan's time outside.

260
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,582
Something she clearly loved.

261
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:16,212
When the excursions
with Amy were postponed,

262
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,080
she may well have overreacted.

263
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:24,052
I believe Amy's use of eco-therapy
was wonderful for Morgan.

264
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:28,303
Cheng believed Morgan
was introduced to this kind of stimuli

265
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,095
at too young an age.

266
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,848
It's okay. Hey, that's it, Morgan.

267
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,141
Hey, hey. It's okay. Hey.

268
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:36,897
No!

269
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,307
It's very unfortunate.

270
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,074
Put your head back.

271
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,147
But we have the opportunity
to learn from this.

272
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,985
We can condition Morgan's behavior.

273
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,319
Teach it about action and consequence.

274
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,620
No, I think that
despite these obvious setbacks,

275
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,332
this project is heading
in the right direction.

276
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,580
It's okay, it's okay.

277
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,706
No. Morgan.

278
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,894
I want you to see how special she is.

279
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,063
We've been working hard,
modifying command cues,

280
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,563
and with the psych
evaluation tomorrow,

281
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:24,035
I prefer your time
with her now be brief.

282
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:25,745
Darren.

283
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:28,571
Darren.

284
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,572
-Darren.
-Hey! Hey.

285
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,993
Lee weathers, from corporate.

286
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,125
Yeah. Right. Corporate.

287
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,701
-Hello. Welcome.
-Hello.

288
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:37,465
How's she doing?

289
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,416
You know, she's okay.

290
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:48,589
What's with the music?

291
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,102
Morgan finds it relaxing.

292
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,180
She likes different kinds of music.

293
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:56,894
Jazz, classical.

294
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,644
She's been quite taken
with opera of late.

295
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,653
Lee wants to say hello.

296
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,359
Can you get Morgan
to shut the music down?

297
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:06,654
Hey, Morgan, buddy.

298
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,566
Can you turn the music down for a few?

299
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,533
We've got somebody here
we'd like you to meet, okay?

300
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,415
We've configured the room.

301
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,746
Morgan's learning to control
some aspects of her environment

302
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,253
without an intermediary.

303
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:49,277
Hello, Morgan.

304
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:52,612
Hello, Lee.

305
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,835
-You know who I am?
-Yes.

306
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:58,619
Of course.

307
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,163
You're Lee weathers.

308
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,250
Risk management consultant at synsect.

309
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,133
And why I'm here?

310
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:10,051
To assess my viability
as a potential product stream...

311
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,391
In light of recent events.

312
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:16,974
That's right.

313
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,522
How are you feeling, Morgan?

314
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,401
I'm feeling

315
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,153
not quite myself.

316
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,782
Morgan's been quite upset

317
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:32,778
about Kathy.

318
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,655
I didn't mean to hurt her.

319
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,244
Kathy is a very sweet person.

320
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,326
I would never wanna do
anything to hurt her.

321
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:43,624
It was an error of judgment.

322
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:44,825
I made a mistake.

323
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,459
But it's okay now, Morgan.

324
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:51,836
It's all right.

325
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,474
I did not mean to be rude.

326
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:58,807
How are you feeling, Lee?

327
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,485
I'm okay.

328
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,227
I'm all right. Thank you for asking.

329
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,148
Would you like to talk about
what happened?

330
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:09,859
We're actually going to save

331
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,150
the psych evaluation
for tomorrow, Morgan.

332
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:15,199
Are we all good here, Lee?

333
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,239
We're good.

334
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:20,043
-Get a good night's sleep, Morgan.
-Yes.

335
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,657
Thank you, Dr. ziegler.

336
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,710
I should get a good night's sleep.

337
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,172
I do feel terribly about it all.

338
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:32,173
Everything that's happened.

339
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,384
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

340
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,094
Yes.

341
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,471
Tomorrow.

342
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,274
Nice to meet you, Morgan.

343
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,189
Nice to meet you, Lee.

344
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,461
You're not even gonna say it?

345
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,376
Say what?

346
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,432
That you're impressed?

347
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:21,679
Is that what you need me to say?

348
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,055
That I'm impressed?

349
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,778
Are we allowed to be here?

350
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,369
It's okay.

351
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,580
This can be our little secret.

352
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:52,843
See, this is a pine tree.

353
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,591
And, you know,

354
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,551
some of them can live
for thousands of years.

355
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,930
-Thousands of years?
-Yeah.

356
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,560
It's pretty cool, isn't it?

357
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,324
Morgan, I'm so proud of you.

358
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,122
Why?

359
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,288
Because you're learning
how to be yourself.

360
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,036
And that's the most important thing.

361
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,776
-That was delicious.
-Thanks.

362
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,453
What, you showing off
for the new girl?

363
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,448
So what does that mean, exactly?
"Risk management consultant"?

364
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,577
Pretty much how it sounds.

365
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:09,658
Most corporations employ
a certain amount of risk

366
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:12,505
and I assess that risk
against anticipated profit.

367
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,881
Of course.

368
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,416
Anticipated profit.

369
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,345
So, did you two meet on the job?

370
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,300
We did.

371
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:26,715
Close quarters makes for
strange bedfellows, I guess.

372
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:30,932
It's funny, but in a weird way,
Morgan really brought us together.

373
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:34,693
She's almost like a child to us.
Isn't that right, babe?

374
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,060
Absolutely.

375
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,146
You know. You met her today.

376
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,529
Saw how special she is.

377
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,285
And that's just the thing.

378
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:47,702
You see, it is so easy to forget
that Morgan is only five years old.

379
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:50,753
She is an innocent and she's learning,

380
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,747
and she has the right
to make mistakes.

381
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,369
She has no rights, whatsoever.

382
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:01,344
Yes. Well, we've been
living here for seven years.

383
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,841
As you can imagine,
it's difficult to avoid gender.

384
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,264
"She," "it," whatever--

385
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:08,222
so you assess this whole
anticipated profit thing.

386
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:09,845
And then what?

387
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,600
Then I make my recommendation
to corporate.

388
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,938
You'll have to forgive
Amy's curiosity.

389
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:18,114
Dr. Cheng,
may I present miss weathers.

390
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,150
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

391
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:21,362
Have we not met before?

392
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:23,027
I don't think so.

393
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,743
I'm sure I would have remembered.

394
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:26,664
So glad you could join us.

395
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:28,489
Thank you.

396
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,124
So, miss weathers...

397
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:33,909
I imagine that corporate has
granted you unreserved authority here.

398
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:38,175
I hope we are able to assist you
in coming to a fair conclusion.

399
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,290
Thank you.

400
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:45,715
I have an enormous amount
of respect for your work, Dr. Cheng.

401
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,049
And your judgment.

402
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,022
Were you in Helsinki for long?

403
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:56,814
Not until after.

404
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:58,561
I was with recovery.

405
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:00,863
I'm sure it was
very difficult for you.

406
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:04,025
No account could do it justice.

407
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,319
We had a team of 30 people
on that project.

408
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,244
It took only an hour

409
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:11,994
for 30 to become nine.

410
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:15,908
I have learned a hard lesson here.

411
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:19,328
For every decision we make,
there are consequences.

412
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:21,377
Well,

413
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,962
this is not Helsinki, Dr. Cheng.

414
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:27,591
Those were crude prototypes.

415
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,223
Morgan is much more advanced.

416
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,221
So much more than the company
could ever expect.

417
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:36,772
I hope that you are correct.

418
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,833
Why did you end Morgan's
eco-therapy sessions with Amy?

419
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,247
There was an incident in the woods.

420
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:58,287
Amy took Morgan
beyond the property lines.

421
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:00,712
It could have compromised
the entire project.

422
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:03,711
That was my excuse.

423
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:05,836
But the truth...

424
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,337
Do you know the cruelest thing

425
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:12,545
you can do to someone
you've locked in a room?

426
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,231
Press their face to the window.

427
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:22,274
You know what you must do.

428
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:45,091
-All right. I want you to watch this.
-Okay.

429
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,758
So, do that weird one he sings...

430
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:49,841
Okay.

431
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:02,812
And then sock you in the stomach
three more times.

432
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:04,525
How did you beat me?

433
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,825
-You're so good!
-Wonderful.

434
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:09,489
Baby, you're so good.
You picked that up so fast.

435
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:11,148
-Can we do it again?
-You guys get that?

436
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:12,316
Can we do it again?

437
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:02,705
You, too, huh?

438
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:04,287
You working late?

439
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,294
It's peaceful out here.

440
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:10,167
Yeah, out here.

441
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,430
Brenda and Darren are going at it

442
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,677
pretty good in the room next to mine.

443
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,059
It's a nice old house,
but the walls are thin.

444
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,930
Can I get you a drink?

445
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:24,555
Please.

446
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:28,065
So, you enjoy the corporate life?

447
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:29,649
It's fine.

448
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,395
Yeah? You been there long?

449
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:33,317
A while.

450
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:39,282
Is that what you wanted to be
when you grew up?

451
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:41,406
A risk management consultant?

452
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,540
You're kind of an over-sharer, huh?

453
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:52,169
So, did Darren and Brenda,
did they pair up early?

454
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:53,974
Pretty early, I guess.

455
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:57,088
After he got tired
of chasing after Amy.

456
00:27:58,762 --> 00:27:59,802
She's interesting.

457
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:03,346
Interesting is a word
to describe her. Sure.

458
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:06,392
You too?

459
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:08,397
Me too? No.

460
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,020
No, not really.

461
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:15,453
Yeah, we fooled around a bit
when we first got up here.

462
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,197
You know, it's... it happens.

463
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,742
-We don't...
-I don't mean to pry.

464
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:24,084
I'm just trying to figure out
how things work around here.

465
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:25,746
Right.

466
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,080
No, we're just two people
having a conversation.

467
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:32,553
There's nothing wrong with that.

468
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:34,708
Right, I understand. Me and Amy.

469
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:37,264
I guess we were
the only two to pick up

470
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:39,971
on the distinct summer camp vibe
when we first made bunk.

471
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,260
But I really don't think I'm her type.

472
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,524
-Hey, Ted.
-Hey.

473
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:50,438
How's she doing?

474
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:52,858
She's a little unsettled tonight.

475
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,900
Right.

476
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,325
What do you make of miss weathers?

477
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:03,949
Oh, you know me, Ted.
I hate just about everybody.

478
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,860
Morgan.

479
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:41,414
Morgan.

480
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:44,278
How do you feel about Morgan?

481
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:46,244
Honestly?

482
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,500
We're one big happy family
up here and all that,

483
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,620
but the thing has always
given me the creeps.

484
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:53,921
You're the only one
I've heard say that.

485
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:56,213
That may be true, but, you know,

486
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:58,425
I'm not a scientist,
maybe I'm just a little jealous.

487
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:00,224
Jealous?

488
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:01,839
-Maybe.
-Why?

489
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:06,474
It made a perfect Risotto.

490
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:09,565
Made it like it was nothing.

491
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:13,435
They say you have to cook with
your heart and soul, all that stuff,

492
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,030
but it just made
the most perfect Risotto.

493
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:29,078
I'm sorry.

494
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:30,788
Oh, god.

495
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:34,497
That is on me.

496
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:39,714
If you knew how long I've been up here
in the middle of nowhere,

497
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:42,047
flipping grilled cheese for these guys

498
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:44,052
and cutting the crusts off
for c-3po, it's...

499
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,176
-Have a good night, skip.
-All right.

500
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:03,492
That was... well played, skip.

501
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:04,989
Well played.

502
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:08,872
I wanted to talk to you

503
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:11,125
before tomorrow.

504
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:16,075
You'll do fine, Morgan.

505
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:17,752
You will.

506
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:19,923
Just be yourself.

507
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:22,673
Okay?

508
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:33,981
Yes.

509
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:36,155
I suppose that's

510
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,229
the only thing I can be.

511
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:43,401
Tell me again.

512
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:46,612
About the lake.

513
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:52,161
You remembered.

514
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:03,168
I'm going to take you to lake navar.

515
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:06,506
It's not too far
from where we are now.

516
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:13,274
It is the most beautiful lake
you will ever see.

517
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:17,273
And if we're quiet,

518
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,610
you can hear just the smallest
whisper of wind through the trees.

519
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:29,985
It's our own paradise, Morgan.

520
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,454
It's just like heaven.

521
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,064
How old is it?

522
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:56,642
I think it's about
as old as the universe.

523
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:11,914
It's a deer.

524
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:16,906
Morgan, don't scare it.

525
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:32,099
Is it hurt?

526
00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:38,677
This doctor, he a friend of yours?

527
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:41,388
No. Why?

528
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,650
I don't think I like him too much.

529
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:48,272
Good to know.

530
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:53,529
They say I can't be there
for the psych eval.

531
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:57,412
Apparently, I didn't clear
for essential personnel.

532
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:11,552
I've reviewed the files.

533
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:13,837
Seems fairly straightforward, no?

534
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:17,722
Well, you may find this is not
your garden variety evaluation.

535
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,595
Morgan is an exceptionally
complex specimen.

536
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:25,139
Well, it's a goddamn microwave,
as far as I'm concerned.

537
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,725
It's not gonna change how I do my job.

538
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:30,606
It's a standard long form
psych eval for 4th wave a.I.

539
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:34,068
Well, she's not a microwave,
and you'd do well to remember that.

540
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,200
This is my job, doctor.

541
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:40,408
It's a job I happen
to be very good at.

542
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:43,196
If you have a problem
with my methodology

543
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:44,705
or a lack of faith in my abilities,

544
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:46,406
I suggest you take that up
with corporate.

545
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,417
-Dr. shapiro.
-Yes?

546
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:50,839
This is Lee weathers.

547
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:53,338
Glad to see you finally arrived.
Trust everything's okay?

548
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,840
Yes. I've apologized for the delay.

549
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,633
I got caught up in Utah,
a personal matter.

550
00:36:57,676 --> 00:36:59,256
Not a problem. We're behind schedule.

551
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:00,933
Will you need to review
the background?

552
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:02,681
No, not necessary.
I can dive right in.

553
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:04,683
I need to be out of here
as soon as possible.

554
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:05,775
Okay. Let's get started then.

555
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:06,939
This way, please.

556
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:29,543
You want me to sit here?

557
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,462
Is this some kind of a joke?

558
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:36,264
Just... in light of recent events,

559
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:38,588
I think we'd all feel
a lot more comfortable

560
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:40,144
with a high safety protocol.

561
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:41,297
Comfortable, right.

562
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:44,097
Well, Ted, in my experience,

563
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:46,979
comfort can be a Thorn
in the side of revelation.

564
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:48,177
Of course. Yes, but--

565
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:50,977
it's my job to build trust
with the subject.

566
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:55,323
It's just gonna be a little hard
with a pane of glass between us.

567
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,399
It's really just
to ensure your safety, doctor.

568
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,117
What did I miss in the brief?

569
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:06,448
Does this thing shoot laser beams
out of its eyes or something?

570
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:09,125
Well, for one,
there's her emergent precognition.

571
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:11,924
What you don't understand is the...

572
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:14,385
The reach of her intelligence.

573
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:16,632
Doctor, all due respect,

574
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:19,302
you need me sitting on the other side
of the glass from this thing,

575
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:20,631
then I think it's safe to say

576
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:23,256
that it has already failed
the psych evaluation.

577
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:30,848
Good.

578
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:35,825
Hello, Morgan.

579
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:38,355
Hello, Dr. shapiro.

580
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:40,903
You know my name.

581
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:42,822
Yes.

582
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:44,784
And you know why I'm here?

583
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:46,909
Yes.

584
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:50,461
Great. Then we can dive right in.

585
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:52,461
That sound okay?

586
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:56,544
Yes.

587
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,840
There's no right or wrong
answers here, Morgan.

588
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:03,179
This is just us having a conversation.

589
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:06,015
Just me and you

590
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:08,425
getting to know each other.

591
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:10,813
Me getting to know you, especially.

592
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:11,981
So you just...

593
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,899
Be yourself. Okay?

594
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:16,731
Okay.

595
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,399
Okay.

596
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:20,606
All righty.

597
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:23,911
Yeah. I was...

598
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,620
I was reading in the report

599
00:39:27,284 --> 00:39:29,954
that you've been feeling a little sad.

600
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,581
You feeling a little sad, Morgan?

601
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:37,543
Yes.

602
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:39,752
Why are you feeling sad?

603
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,180
I'm sad about Kathy.

604
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:46,892
Kathy grieff?

605
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:48,888
Yes.

606
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:53,564
Can you tell me what you did?

607
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:58,273
I stabbed Kathy in the eye.

608
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:00,816
It was an error.

609
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:03,068
I shouldn't have done it.

610
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,080
Feeling sad is the correct response.

611
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:13,464
Yeah.

612
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:16,999
And...

613
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:21,548
What would we call
an incorrect response?

614
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:27,969
Laughter.

615
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:32,975
Yeah, sure. Laughter would be
an incorrect response, yeah.

616
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,305
What makes you laugh, Morgan?

617
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:38,193
I don't have
a very good sense of humor.

618
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
That's okay.

619
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:44,651
People tell me the same thing, so...

620
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:51,411
Do you consider yourself
a person, Morgan?

621
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:54,041
No. I am something new.

622
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:56,542
There is no appropriate label.

623
00:40:57,082 --> 00:41:00,672
Do you think it's safe to say
that your consciousness is superior?

624
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:01,801
No.

625
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:03,919
It's just different.

626
00:41:05,757 --> 00:41:07,177
Apples and oranges, huh?

627
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:14,269
It's a saying. It means that...

628
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:16,945
You're different from human beings

629
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:19,483
the way that apples
are different from oranges.

630
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:25,443
Yes. Of course.

631
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:27,945
I am apples and oranges.

632
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:35,156
Forgive me, I occasionally
struggle with metaphor.

633
00:41:35,204 --> 00:41:36,584
Do you like it here, Morgan?

634
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:40,084
Yes.

635
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:42,917
What do you like about it?

636
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:46,422
I like my music.

637
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:49,225
I like my friends.

638
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:50,389
Who are your friends?

639
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:52,355
Darren is my friend.

640
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:56,852
Brenda is my friend.
Amy is my friend--

641
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:58,846
they're your friends, right.

642
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,520
But do you think
they treat you like a friend?

643
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,359
Do you?

644
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:13,872
You think it's normal for friends
to lock each other in cages?

645
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:15,949
-I was not always in a cage.
-No?

646
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:19,866
Before the incident, I was free
to come and go as I pleased.

647
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:22,667
Well...

648
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,010
I was reading in the notes,
in regard to the incident with Kathy,

649
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:29,758
that there was, in fact,

650
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:32,472
some disagreement on that matter

651
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:34,511
the day before.
Could you look at me, please, Morgan?

652
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:42,599
I was meant to go
to the lake with Amy.

653
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:46,613
Go to the lake with Amy. I see.

654
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:49,862
That sounds like fun.
No wonder you were upset.

655
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:51,033
I was not upset.

656
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:54,276
There was an error.

657
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:57,414
An error?

658
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:59,872
Like the error that
occurred with Kathy?

659
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,500
I love Kathy.

660
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,249
You experience love?

661
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:14,929
I have the ability
to demonstrate love.

662
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:17,471
Okay.

663
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:22,059
So you can demonstrate love

664
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:23,982
and sadness.

665
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:26,901
How do you express other emotions?

666
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:28,567
What other emotions?

667
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,321
I don't know. Fear?

668
00:43:32,738 --> 00:43:33,858
Anger?

669
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,330
You're a father, aren't you?

670
00:43:49,004 --> 00:43:50,464
You have a 13-year-old daughter.

671
00:43:55,886 --> 00:43:57,676
You don't get to see her much anymore.

672
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:07,194
Yeah...

673
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:10,857
I am a father.

674
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:15,608
So, what...

675
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:18,952
What am I supposed to understand here?
What am I missing?

676
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:23,750
-I'm a child.
-You're a child.

677
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:29,129
Yeah. That's true. You're a child.

678
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:32,925
You're only five years old.

679
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,930
What emotion do you think you were
expressing with Kathy, Morgan?

680
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:43,766
I love Kathy.

681
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:48,019
What about me?

682
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:51,152
Do you love me?

683
00:44:52,568 --> 00:44:54,318
-No.
-No?

684
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:57,445
That hurts my feelings a little bit.

685
00:44:57,489 --> 00:45:00,369
But you know what?
I get it. You just met me.

686
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:03,333
But, you know,
you might grow to love me.

687
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:09,545
Yeah. If, say, I recommended
that you be allowed to go to the lake.

688
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:11,377
With Amy.

689
00:45:14,006 --> 00:45:15,336
Would you love me then?

690
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:20,803
I don't know.

691
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:26,431
What if I made
a different recommendation?

692
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:29,518
What if I recommended

693
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:32,857
that you should not be allowed
to leave this room?

694
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:38,947
My feelings are irrelevant.
If that is the recommendation--

695
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:40,119
okay.

696
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:43,327
What if I made the recommendation that
you not be able to leave this room

697
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:45,198
and you not be able
to listen to your music

698
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:46,995
and you not be able
to see your friends?

699
00:45:48,832 --> 00:45:52,172
What if I recommended
that you be terminated?

700
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:05,055
Okay. All right.

701
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:06,849
Forget that.

702
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:10,439
Okay? Forget it. Let's say...

703
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:12,729
Let's say I do the opposite, okay?

704
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:16,575
What if I recommend
that you be allowed to go to the lake

705
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,070
and then I drive you there myself?

706
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:23,161
Yeah. Then, it would be only natural
you'd have warmer feelings for me.

707
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,660
Feelings like you might have for Amy

708
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:27,082
or for any of your friends here.

709
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,120
Maybe even feelings like love.

710
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:32,964
I suppose. I... I don't know.
It's a hypothetical situation.

711
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:35,551
Exactly. So, hypothetically,
what would you do

712
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:37,877
if I recommended
that you be terminated?

713
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:39,553
What would you do, hypothetically?

714
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:41,551
-I don't know.
-Come on. You don't know?

715
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:43,510
-No.
-Off the top of your head.

716
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:45,354
-I don't know.
-No right or wrong answer.

717
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:46,509
-I don't know!
-Come on!

718
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:49,524
-Answer me. What would you do?
-I don't know.

719
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,440
What would you do?

720
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:52,937
We should end this.

721
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,650
Show me, if you can't tell me.

722
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:01,775
Demonstrate it for me.

723
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:04,991
That's it.

724
00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:10,751
What is that?
I don't know what that is.

725
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:12,828
What is that showing me?

726
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:14,747
Show me!

727
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:17,053
I don't know what this is.
What is that?

728
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:18,417
Show me how you feel!

729
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:23,259
Show me how you feel!

730
00:47:26,263 --> 00:47:27,263
Morgan!

731
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:28,723
Tranquilizers! Go!

732
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:30,596
Now!

733
00:47:36,315 --> 00:47:38,945
Brenda. Get Brenda. Go!

734
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:42,526
Shit. Shit.

735
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:46,324
Morgan!

736
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:51,365
No. What the fuck? Shit!

737
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:54,246
Morgan.

738
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:56,581
Buddy. I need you to
chill the fuck out, okay?

739
00:48:01,173 --> 00:48:02,263
Fuck. Fuck.

740
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:12,641
Morgan.

741
00:48:57,187 --> 00:48:58,187
Morgan?

742
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:14,161
Morgan?

743
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:16,038
Morgan, look at me.

744
00:49:16,707 --> 00:49:17,707
Morgan.

745
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:20,293
Baby.

746
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:42,321
What happened?

747
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:45,606
Please. Try to relax, Morgan.

748
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:50,373
Darren, did I hurt him?

749
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:52,949
No. I'm okay, buddy.

750
00:49:53,577 --> 00:49:54,577
I'm right here, okay?

751
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:56,405
I didn't mean to do it.

752
00:49:56,455 --> 00:49:59,005
Hey, I know. I know.

753
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:04,920
I can't move my arms.

754
00:50:04,963 --> 00:50:06,173
You've been restrained.

755
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:07,305
Morgan.

756
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:10,138
We have decided on a plan of action.

757
00:50:10,636 --> 00:50:12,176
One that is best for you.

758
00:50:13,597 --> 00:50:14,967
Best for me?

759
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:17,308
Oh, my god.

760
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:19,522
What are we doing?

761
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:22,651
We need to inform corporate
immediately, Dr. ziegler.

762
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:23,689
I've taken the Liberty.

763
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:26,361
A containment crew
will be here at daybreak

764
00:50:26,401 --> 00:50:28,821
to collect the specimen
and any other data for analysis.

765
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:29,952
No, that's not gonna work.

766
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:33,704
No one else can handle
this kind of material.

767
00:50:34,952 --> 00:50:37,912
It's more effective
if we process the data here.

768
00:50:38,497 --> 00:50:40,787
I'm sorry, doctor.
There's no other work to be done here.

769
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:42,082
But it's our work.

770
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:44,965
Our lives invested in this.

771
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:48,841
We've created new life and you want us
to just throw that away?

772
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:49,882
Enough.

773
00:50:51,844 --> 00:50:53,264
We've failed, Simon.

774
00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:57,638
-There's no reason to labor the point.
-Cheng--

775
00:50:57,683 --> 00:51:00,563
go back to the house.
You don't need to be here.

776
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:03,147
Right.

777
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:04,768
And allow you to do what?

778
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:08,114
To destroy years of work?

779
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:11,201
Go back to the house.
Pour yourself a drink.

780
00:51:15,826 --> 00:51:17,236
If that's what you think is best.

781
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,420
Sodium thiopental.

782
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:35,392
Five milliliters to sedate.

783
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:36,971
What are you doing?

784
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:41,435
Then, 30 milliliters
of dihydromorphinone.

785
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:44,558
Have I disappointed you, mother?

786
00:51:47,316 --> 00:51:50,106
Have I failed? I always do my best.

787
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:53,365
I do everything you ask, Ted.

788
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,571
Amy. Amy!

789
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:59,330
No. No.

790
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:02,043
No! I promise I'll do better.

791
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,250
-I'll do whatever you want.
-Take it easy.

792
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,090
-No, no!
-Just relax. Relax.

793
00:52:07,544 --> 00:52:10,424
-It is time to go to sleep, Morgan.
-No!

794
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,304
-It's gonna be okay, buddy.
-No.

795
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:15,093
I don't wanna die! Please, mother.

796
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,600
-This will help.
-No!

797
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,180
-You won't feel any more pain.
-No! Don't!

798
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:26,229
I wanna live. Please, mother.

799
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:28,611
I'm not your mother, Morgan.

800
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:30,936
You have no mother.

801
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:39,238
I have no mother.

802
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:43,496
I'm sorry.

803
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:46,165
We have failed you.

804
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:52,547
Make it quick.

805
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:07,353
Morgan!

806
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,275
I'm gonna get you!

807
00:53:10,649 --> 00:53:11,729
I'm gonna get you.

808
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:14,861
Morgan?

809
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:19,407
Morgan?

810
00:53:20,951 --> 00:53:21,951
Simon.

811
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:40,469
I am sorry.

812
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:14,962
Go fuck yourself.

813
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:20,593
I'm not gonna do it.

814
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:34,607
Darren.

815
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:41,663
-I'm sorry.
-No, you're right.

816
00:54:41,698 --> 00:54:42,698
Come on.

817
00:54:46,828 --> 00:54:48,118
I can't let you do this.

818
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:50,207
Get out of my way, Ted.

819
00:54:50,249 --> 00:54:51,329
I'm sorry, Lee, but no.

820
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:11,729
Lee!

821
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:13,479
Lee.

822
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:15,189
Lee.

823
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:18,573
It's usually effective
for at least another hour.

824
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:24,201
Lee. This is just
an unfortunate situation.

825
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:32,172
We all feel terrible about it,
about what happened.

826
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,381
Especially Amy.

827
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:36,499
Where's Morgan?

828
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:38,087
Look...

829
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:40,795
You know that I'm here, just like you,

830
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:42,761
as a representative of the company.

831
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:46,099
I'm here to act
in their best interests.

832
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:50,645
We have an honest
difference of opinion, you and I.

833
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:53,058
I feel like corporate deserves

834
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:55,233
an opportunity to hear
our side of things.

835
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:59,476
You're a professional, Lee.
And I respect that.

836
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:03,282
It's because of that professionalism
that I think you should understand

837
00:56:03,322 --> 00:56:05,662
and appreciate
our course of action here.

838
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:15,133
Let me out. Now.

839
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:17,634
I'm sorry, Lee. I can't do that.

840
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:29,759
They're gonna be here.

841
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:34,064
Your friends over at corporate are
gonna be here sooner than you think.

842
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:37,481
We're all gonna have
a nice little chat about everything.

843
00:56:39,525 --> 00:56:42,945
Of course. You get some rest now.

844
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:46,034
I understand
how you feel about Morgan.

845
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:48,162
How much you care for her.

846
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:52,159
Ted, it needs to be terminated.

847
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:07,932
She's angry.

848
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,390
Of course she's angry.

849
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:11,429
Can't worry about that now.
We're past that.

850
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:13,682
How close are we?

851
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:16,435
Brenda's bringing the minivan around
and clearing out the office.

852
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:17,977
-Darren?
-Yeah?

853
00:57:18,021 --> 00:57:20,981
-How we doing in there?
-We're close. Very close.

854
00:57:23,986 --> 00:57:24,986
Morgan.

855
00:57:31,702 --> 00:57:32,742
What's going on?

856
00:57:34,746 --> 00:57:36,786
Nothing. Go back to bed, Kathy.

857
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:38,542
I wanna know what's going on.

858
00:57:38,584 --> 00:57:41,504
Nothing. Just stay out of it.

859
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:43,958
What happened?

860
00:57:45,048 --> 00:57:46,928
Nothing. Everything is fine.

861
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:50,305
-Morgan is gonna be fine.
-Bren?

862
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:51,675
-Oh, god!
-Where's Morgan?

863
00:57:51,722 --> 00:57:53,062
Just go back to bed.

864
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:58,939
Where's Morgan?

865
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:01,647
Morgan.

866
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:03,316
Sweetie.

867
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:05,986
We have to go now, okay?

868
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:09,607
I need you to sit up for me.
Can you do that?

869
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:13,370
Morgan, come on. Come here. Morgan.

870
00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:15,539
-Darren?
-Yeah.

871
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:16,869
I need you to sit her up.

872
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:20,002
All right. Here. You do this.

873
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:21,634
Okay.

874
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:25,172
Hey, buddy. I need you
to wake up. Come on.

875
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,339
We're gonna go on a little trip here.

876
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:30,046
On a little adventure. Come on.

877
00:58:31,094 --> 00:58:34,434
Come here. Here, look. Look here.
Look here. Hey.

878
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:35,563
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

879
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:38,519
Hey, buddy.

880
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,270
Everything's gonna be okay.

881
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:53,032
Morgan, no! Darren!

882
00:58:56,203 --> 00:58:57,413
Oh, my god.

883
00:58:57,996 --> 00:58:59,746
Morgan. Morgan, no!

884
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:13,933
You gotta stop.

885
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:15,891
You're not well, Morgan.

886
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:18,057
You're sick.

887
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:20,846
I'm feeling much better.

888
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:52,338
Where are you going?

889
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:53,394
It's over.

890
00:59:53,886 --> 00:59:56,046
You're not leaving 'cause you're not
allowed to leave.

891
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:57,216
You wanna tell me what's going on?

892
00:59:57,264 --> 00:59:58,524
We're outta here, okay?

893
01:00:10,861 --> 01:00:11,901
Hello, Lee.

894
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:13,025
Open the door.

895
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,117
Doctor shapiro was correct.

896
01:00:17,534 --> 01:00:19,204
Those people were not my friends.

897
01:00:20,621 --> 01:00:21,791
They wanted to kill me.

898
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:23,456
Except for Amy.

899
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:26,378
She's the only one
that truly loved me.

900
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:28,667
You need help, Morgan.

901
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:31,841
Open the door and let me help you.

902
01:00:31,882 --> 01:00:32,882
I don't need your help.

903
01:00:35,052 --> 01:00:36,802
I'm starting to feel like myself.

904
01:00:37,804 --> 01:00:39,564
Do you feel like yourself, Lee?

905
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:43,889
Or do you feel like something else?

906
01:00:47,064 --> 01:00:48,774
I know why they made me.

907
01:00:49,942 --> 01:00:51,362
But what if they're wrong?

908
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:54,403
Why don't you come inside?

909
01:00:55,614 --> 01:00:56,824
We can talk about everything.

910
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:58,947
I'd love to stay and talk, Lee.

911
01:01:00,577 --> 01:01:02,657
I feel there's so much
we have to talk about.

912
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:08,211
-But I have to go now.
-Open the door.

913
01:01:08,794 --> 01:01:10,094
One day, you'll understand.

914
01:01:10,587 --> 01:01:11,587
Morgan!

915
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:16,383
Oh, fuck.

916
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:18,604
Amy!

917
01:01:19,555 --> 01:01:20,565
What are you doing?

918
01:01:21,098 --> 01:01:22,098
Skip.

919
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:24,933
Get Morgan back inside. Amy!

920
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,650
Stop them.

921
01:01:34,236 --> 01:01:36,106
-Skip, don't go in there, okay?
-Don't what?

922
01:01:36,154 --> 01:01:38,494
-Don't go down there, skip.
-What are you talking about?

923
01:01:38,532 --> 01:01:39,662
-Brenda!
-Where's Lee?

924
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:45,459
Brenda!

925
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:49,380
Brenda!

926
01:01:51,295 --> 01:01:52,305
Fuck!

927
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:55,545
-No, no, no.
-What the fuck? I nearly ran--

928
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:57,471
we gotta leave. Brenda, we gotta go.

929
01:01:57,509 --> 01:01:59,009
-Amy! What's going on?
-It's Morgan.

930
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:01,552
-Where is everyone else?
-It's Morgan.

931
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:04,219
-Where's Darren?
-Darren...

932
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:08,650
Okay. Morgan. Where is she?

933
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:10,607
Where is Morgan, Amy?

934
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:12,107
I'm right here, Brenda.

935
01:02:17,446 --> 01:02:19,856
Hey, Morgan. Hey.

936
01:02:21,366 --> 01:02:22,696
Okay.

937
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,910
Give me the gun, Morgan.

938
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:30,825
Easy, easy. Easy, Morgan.

939
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:32,668
Okay.

940
01:02:33,378 --> 01:02:35,048
Where's Darren, huh?

941
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:39,796
Where is Darren, Morgan?

942
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:46,734
Sorry, buddy.

943
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:01,605
Morgan!

944
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:13,338
Don't be afraid, Amy.

945
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:24,011
Get in the car.

946
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:30,516
I have to go say goodbye to mother.

947
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:48,497
This is Dr. lui Cheng.

948
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:52,366
Technical director
of the l-9 Morgan program.

949
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:58,375
It pains me to report an accident
that occurred

950
01:03:58,422 --> 01:04:01,802
during the scheduled
psychological evaluation of Morgan.

951
01:04:03,343 --> 01:04:06,763
We had anticipated
that by developing a model

952
01:04:06,805 --> 01:04:11,015
that was more self-aware,
more autonomous, and more human,

953
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:14,599
we could teach it to be
the best of what we are.

954
01:04:16,106 --> 01:04:20,686
Our intent was to demonstrate to you,
to the synsect board,

955
01:04:20,736 --> 01:04:24,856
that a more refined and peaceful
synthetic life-form is possible.

956
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:28,409
Morgan?

957
01:04:30,078 --> 01:04:31,078
Baby.

958
01:04:39,171 --> 01:04:40,261
Darren.

959
01:04:40,297 --> 01:04:42,587
Despite our attempts
to promote a natural

960
01:04:42,633 --> 01:04:44,053
emotional intelligence,

961
01:04:44,635 --> 01:04:47,265
Morgan has been unable to move beyond

962
01:04:47,304 --> 01:04:49,394
its weaponized design parameters.

963
01:04:54,436 --> 01:04:55,806
Shit. Fuck.

964
01:05:15,165 --> 01:05:16,165
Lee!

965
01:05:19,294 --> 01:05:21,054
Listen to me. You can't go in there.

966
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:23,208
Morgan's gone... she's gone postal.

967
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:25,877
This is what I do, skip.
Go get your rifle.

968
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:33,932
Confirmation of program collapse.

969
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,940
Morgan is no longer viable.

970
01:05:36,979 --> 01:05:37,979
Mother.

971
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:49,697
All right.

972
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:52,947
Implementation of loss protocol

973
01:05:53,912 --> 01:05:55,002
in action.

974
01:06:08,343 --> 01:06:10,223
I have come to say goodbye.

975
01:06:13,015 --> 01:06:15,025
You should have told me, mother.

976
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:17,596
What I truly was.

977
01:06:18,937 --> 01:06:20,517
What I would become.

978
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:27,319
I'm sorry.

979
01:06:28,447 --> 01:06:32,237
Now you know exactly who you are.

980
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,480
Amy.

981
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:46,230
Hey, get out of the car.

982
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:48,937
Amy, get out of the car.
It's not safe here.

983
01:07:49,444 --> 01:07:50,574
-Give me the gun.
-No!

984
01:07:51,905 --> 01:07:54,735
All right. Okay. Okay.

985
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:00,911
All right. Okay.

986
01:09:09,358 --> 01:09:10,898
No, stop. Stop!

987
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:18,315
Move. Now.

988
01:09:38,554 --> 01:09:39,554
Morgan.

989
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:42,639
Morgan. Morgan!

990
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:44,315
Morgan, no! Don't!

991
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:50,541
Oh, fuck!

992
01:10:52,377 --> 01:10:53,957
Morgan! Stop!

993
01:10:56,465 --> 01:10:57,475
No, Morgan.

994
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,605
Jesus Christ, you all right?

995
01:11:19,238 --> 01:11:21,198
-I'm taking your car.
-What?

996
01:11:21,823 --> 01:11:24,123
No, you're hurt. Let it go. Let it go.

997
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:27,253
No. That's not how it works.

998
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:33,376
Get in. I know where they're going.

999
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,230
I'm not gonna hurt you, Amy.

1000
01:12:32,936 --> 01:12:33,936
You'll see.

1001
01:12:50,412 --> 01:12:52,582
Pull over here. Not too close.

1002
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:07,351
Get back in the car.

1003
01:13:07,387 --> 01:13:08,807
No, goddamn it.
I'm coming to help you.

1004
01:13:10,015 --> 01:13:11,135
Let me do my job.

1005
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:37,835
You'll see now.

1006
01:13:40,087 --> 01:13:41,707
How happy we can be.

1007
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:39,371
Is this what heaven's like?

1008
01:15:46,213 --> 01:15:47,213
I don't know.

1009
01:15:59,893 --> 01:16:01,353
It must be.

1010
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,240
I feel...

1011
01:16:21,665 --> 01:16:22,675
Alive.

1012
01:17:25,562 --> 01:17:26,562
What was that?

1013
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:30,149
Morgan?

1014
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:34,820
Please, don't...

1015
01:17:35,656 --> 01:17:36,656
Morgan?

1016
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:12,860
Oh, shit.

1017
01:20:11,562 --> 01:20:12,732
What happened?

1018
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:15,936
Was it Lee?

1019
01:20:17,442 --> 01:20:18,822
We go. Now.

1020
01:20:18,861 --> 01:20:20,281
No! Morgan.

1021
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:23,698
You have to stop.

1022
01:20:25,784 --> 01:20:27,294
Okay? Stop.

1023
01:22:28,448 --> 01:22:29,448
What happened?

1024
01:22:30,742 --> 01:22:31,742
It's over.

1025
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,200
Morgan's dead?

1026
01:22:35,414 --> 01:22:36,414
It's dead.

1027
01:22:40,043 --> 01:22:41,093
Where's Amy?

1028
01:22:41,128 --> 01:22:42,128
We need to leave.

1029
01:22:44,214 --> 01:22:45,344
What happened to Amy?

1030
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:52,350
I'm sorry, skip.

1031
01:22:54,224 --> 01:22:55,434
Just wait a second. Lee...

1032
01:23:23,545 --> 01:23:24,875
She did very well.

1033
01:23:26,757 --> 01:23:28,717
Agreed, the situation is untidy,

1034
01:23:28,759 --> 01:23:31,509
but given the unpredictable
nature of the assignment,

1035
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:34,143
she prosecuted her mandate perfectly.

1036
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:36,768
She was measured and surgical,

1037
01:23:36,808 --> 01:23:40,518
even when the situation
was considerably less so.

1038
01:23:40,562 --> 01:23:41,902
Most importantly,

1039
01:23:42,689 --> 01:23:45,479
she followed her directives
without hesitation.

1040
01:23:47,528 --> 01:23:50,818
The collateral damage
was regrettable, of course.

1041
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:52,913
But in this case,

1042
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:54,655
unavoidable.

1043
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:02,577
I think these events
make it punishingly clear

1044
01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:04,086
what I had already predicted.

1045
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,504
The l-9

1046
01:24:07,256 --> 01:24:08,716
was the inferior program.

1047
01:24:14,847 --> 01:24:18,097
Though its emotional development
was certainly remarkable,

1048
01:24:18,976 --> 01:24:20,266
the immediate termination

1049
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:23,100
was an unfortunate
but clear necessity.

1050
01:24:23,605 --> 01:24:27,855
Well, I guess the old dogs
hunt the best, sir.

1051
01:24:28,569 --> 01:24:29,569
Then it's settled.

1052
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,610
We stick to what we know.

1053
01:24:32,447 --> 01:24:36,367
All development assets
revert to the l-4 stream.

1054
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:40,292
So what do we do about Lee weathers?

1055
01:24:41,915 --> 01:24:42,955
What about her?

1056
01:24:44,501 --> 01:24:45,501
She's perfect.
