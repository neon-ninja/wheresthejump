1
00:00:04,412 --> 00:00:12,536
(telephone ringing)

2
00:00:13,412 --> 00:00:15,536
- Hello?
- (the voice) Hello.

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,244
- Uh, yes?
- Who is this?

4
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:20,952
- Who are you calling?
- Who am I speaking to?

5
00:00:21,037 --> 00:00:22,660
(scoffs) Wrong number.
(beep)

6
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:25,036
- Who was that?
- Oh, nobody.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,202
- Did you pick a movie?
- Yeah. We're gonna go scary.

8
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:30,994
- "Saw 4."
- Ugh. I saw that in theaters.

9
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:33,202
It sucks.
It's not scary, it's gross.

10
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:35,119
I hate all that torture-porn shit.

11
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:37,785
(chuckles)
How do you really feel?

12
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,036
Well, I like Jigsaw.
I think he kills people very creatively.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,494
But you don't give a shit who dies
'cause there's no character development.

14
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,369
There's just body parts ripping
and blood spewing. Blah.

15
00:00:48,454 --> 00:00:51,328
- Who do you keep texting?
- I have a Facebook stalker.

16
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:54,369
- He keeps leaving me messages.
- Yeah, like what?

17
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:58,369
Just stuff. Like, "Hey, what's up?
You're hot. I wanna kill you."

18
00:00:58,454 --> 00:01:00,161
So delete him.

19
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:02,744
I did,
but he hacked his way back in.

20
00:01:02,828 --> 00:01:05,077
So report him.

21
00:01:05,162 --> 00:01:09,494
He's really hot, though.
You wanna see?

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,869
That's Channing Tatum.

23
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:17,036
It is not.
Is it?

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,910
Yeah, from his Abercrombie days.
You are being punk'd.

25
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:23,077
(telephone rings)

26
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:29,827
- Hello?
- (the voice) Who is this?

27
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:33,119
The more impatient version
of the person you just spoke to.

28
00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:36,036
I'm sorry.
You don't have to be a bitch about it.

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,577
No, of course I don't.
Eat me.

30
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:40,744
You hang up on me and I'll cut through
your neck until I feel bone!

31
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:43,619
- Who is it?
- It's for you.

32
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:48,411
- Hello?
- Who's this?

33
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:50,577
It's Trudie.
Who's this?

34
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:54,286
This is the last person
you're ever gonna see alive.

35
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,535
It's a prank. Hang up.

36
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,119
(beep)
Why'd you hand the phone to me?

37
00:01:58,203 --> 00:02:01,535
You're the one with the stalker.
Are the doors locked?

38
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,702
Don't freak out.

39
00:02:03,786 --> 00:02:07,328
(telephone rings)

40
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:11,411
Let it ring.

41
00:02:11,494 --> 00:02:13,493
(beep)

42
00:02:13,578 --> 00:02:16,453
(cell phone vibrates)

43
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,119
It's from stalker boy.

44
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:20,952
He said, "Answer the phone."

45
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:23,619
(sighs) For God's sake.
It's a joke, Trudie.

46
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:26,161
It's probably Lexi or Karen.
Where are you going?

47
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:28,702
To make sure
the front door is locked.

48
00:02:28,786 --> 00:02:30,869
(doorbell rings, both scream)

49
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:32,493
No. Don't open it.

50
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:36,244
You're overreacting.
(scoffs)

51
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:40,119
It's a joke, Trudie, okay?
Somebody made a dummy profile.

52
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:42,369
- They're just trying to scare you.
- Wait.

53
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,702
(loudly) Who is it?

54
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:47,660
I said, who is it?

55
00:02:47,745 --> 00:02:49,952
Let's call the cops.

56
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,702
(cell phone vibrates)

57
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:55,994
"I dare you to open the door."

58
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:57,702
No, Sherrie. Don't.

59
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:59,493
No, don't, I'm scared.

60
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:01,952
Hey,
it could be anyone that we know.

61
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:04,036
Lisa, Bailey, Wayne,

62
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,785
or the hopeful long shot,
Channing Tatum.

63
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:26,869
- There's nobody out here.
- (sighs softly)

64
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:30,286
(cell phone vibrates)

65
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,660
What does it say?

66
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:36,869
It says, "I'm not outside.
I'm right beside you."

67
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:39,869
(screams) Trudie!

68
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,161
Trudie... oh, my God.

69
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:43,493
(screams)

70
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:46,286
(gasping)

71
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:57,938
(woman screams)

72
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:01,869
Fucking kidding me?

73
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:03,244
What?

74
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:05,660
That was so fucking stupid.
Pure horseshit.

75
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,161
The death of horror
right here in front of us.

76
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:09,619
I jumped.
Scared me.

77
00:04:09,703 --> 00:04:13,161
A fucking Facebook killer?
You're kidding me, right?

78
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:16,910
I guess now it would be Twitter.
That'd make more sense.

79
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:20,619
A bunch of articulate teens sit around
and deconstruct horror movies

80
00:04:20,703 --> 00:04:23,202
until Ghostface kills them one by one?

81
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:24,994
It's been done to death,

82
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:28,202
the whole self-aware,
post-modern meta shit.

83
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,368
Stick a fork in 1996 already.

84
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:34,910
I like the "Stab" movies.
They're scarier.

85
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:38,202
It's not aliens or zombies
or little Asian ghost girls.

86
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:42,619
There's something real about a guy
with a knife who just...

87
00:04:42,703 --> 00:04:45,660
snaps.

88
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,785
It could really happen.

89
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,577
I can't do it.
These sequels don't know when to stop.

90
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:54,161
They just keep recycling
the same shit.

91
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:55,702
Even the opening scene.

92
00:04:55,786 --> 00:04:57,660
There's always some random girl
who gets a call

93
00:04:57,745 --> 00:04:59,286
that undoubtedly ends up
getting her killed.

94
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:01,827
It's all so predictable.
There's no element of surprise.

95
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:04,493
You can see everything coming!

96
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:06,244
Aah! (gasps softly)

97
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,619
- (gasps)
- Did that surprise you?

98
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,535
Why?

99
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,077
- Because you talk too much.
- Agh!

100
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,161
Now shut the fuck up
and watch the movie.

101
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,077
(chokes wetly)

102
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:31,744
(woman screams)

103
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,952
Oh, my God, I love it.

104
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:36,952
I've seen it five times,
and it still gets me every time.

105
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,702
You're kidding.
I don't get it.

106
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:42,493
(TV shuts off)

107
00:05:42,578 --> 00:05:45,244
Okay.
It's like "The Twilight Zone."

108
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:47,410
"Twilight Zone"?
A movie within a movie.

109
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:48,994
I get that.
But it's illogical.

110
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:51,827
It begs the question that if the
beginning of "Stab 7" is "Stab 6,"

111
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,202
then is the beginning
of "Stab 6" "Stab 5"?

112
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:55,910
And, if so,
what is "Stab 4" about?

113
00:05:55,995 --> 00:05:58,368
- You're over-thinking it.
- Am I?

114
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:00,077
Or did whoever make it
just under-think it?

115
00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:02,202
There's a reason
I don't watch these movies.

116
00:06:02,286 --> 00:06:05,619
I can't believe you haven't seen them.
We live in Woodsboro.

117
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,077
That has nothing to do
with Woodsboro.

118
00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:11,077
I... I thought you said "Stab"
was based on true stories.

119
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,161
The first three, the original trilogy,
is based off of Sidney Prescott,

120
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:17,161
but then she threatened to sue them
if they used her story,

121
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,161
so then they just started making
stuff up.

122
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:22,535
"Stab 5" has time travel,
which is by far the worst.

123
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,202
Don't we hear enough
about this story every year?

124
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,452
At least Woodsboro's known
for something.

125
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:31,243
(faint rattle)
Did you hear that?

126
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:33,452
Uh....

127
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:36,077
No, I didn't hear anything.

128
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,202
I did.

129
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,064
Jenny?

130
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:42,410
- Don't try to scare me.
- I'm not trying to scare you.

131
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:44,869
- You do it all the time.
- No, I don't.

132
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:47,910
- Where are you going?
- I told you, I heard something.

133
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:49,619
- I know you're trying to scare me.

134
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,026
- I'm not.

135
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,785
(faint thudding)

136
00:06:58,244 --> 00:07:00,410
What is it?

137
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:03,452
I must have left a window
in my room open.

138
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,201
(telephone rings)

139
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:08,910
Could you get that?

140
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,577
- Marnie?
- Yeah.

141
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:13,327
(ringing continues)

142
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,119
(beep)

143
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:18,994
- Hello?
- (the voice) Hello. Who is this?

144
00:07:19,078 --> 00:07:21,243
Marnie.
Who's this?

145
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:26,744
This is the last person
you're ever gonna see alive.

146
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,277
- What?
- (laughs)

147
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:32,744
(laughing) I'm sorry.

148
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,368
I had to.

149
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:36,619
(sigh) You bitch.

150
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,493
So not funny.

151
00:07:38,578 --> 00:07:40,827
Somebody falls for it
every year.

152
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:42,994
I don't see why you get off on this sh...

153
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:44,535
(chokes, gasps)

154
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,243
(dial tone)
Marnie?

155
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:48,418
(crash)

156
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,160
(beep)
Marnie?

157
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,410
Marnie?

158
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:05,119
Good one, Marnie.
Lights out, phone on the floor?

159
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:09,994
You know,
you really should direct horror films.

160
00:08:10,078 --> 00:08:12,785
Wherever you are.

161
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,368
(sighs) Let me guess.

162
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,952
You want me to walk by an open doorframe
so you can pop out, huh?

163
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:23,619
(telephone rings, gasps)

164
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:28,036
(chuckles) Okay, timing,
timing is perfect.

165
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:30,910
But you don't have the app
on your phone,

166
00:08:30,995 --> 00:08:33,744
so you can't talk like Ghostface,
can you?

167
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,994
(the voice) Yes I can.

168
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:39,160
- Who is this?
- Not an app.

169
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:40,660
Is this Trevor?

170
00:08:40,745 --> 00:08:43,744
Do I sound like a Trevor to you?
Think of me as your director.

171
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:47,410
You're in my movie.
You got a fun part, so don't blow it.

172
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,660
- What movie?
- Same one Marnie's in.

173
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:52,243
Only her part got cut way back.

174
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:55,118
But you, you're the dumb blonde
with the big tits.

175
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,036
We'll have some fun with you
before you die.

176
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:03,493
I have a 4.0 GPA and 135 IQ, asshole.
What did you do with Marnie?

177
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:06,368
- She's on the cutting room floor.
- That's not funny.

178
00:09:06,453 --> 00:09:08,285
This isn't a comedy.
It's a horror film.

179
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:11,869
People live, people die.
And you'd better start running.

180
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:14,785
(crash)
(screams)

181
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,827
(dog barking in distance)

182
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:18,577
Marnie?

183
00:09:19,265 --> 00:09:20,587
(whimpers)

184
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,076
(screams)

185
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,869
(screaming)

186
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:30,032
(screams again)

187
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,994
(panting)

188
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:44,735
(breathing heavily)

189
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,660
(screams)

190
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:51,676
(knife slash)
(scream)

191
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,760
(grunts)

192
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,235
(garage door whirs)

193
00:10:25,744 --> 00:10:26,954
(door whirs)

194
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,368
(grunting and whimpering)

195
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:29,577
(screams, crunch)

196
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:35,952
(whimpering)

197
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:39,702
(screams)

198
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:47,764
(screams)

199
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:51,201
(woman screams,
"Something To Die For" plays)

200
00:10:55,161 --> 00:10:58,368
<i>¶  Working for
another hour tonight</i>

201
00:10:58,453 --> 00:11:02,118
<i>¶  Staring at the wall
and let the time just pass me by</i>

202
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:05,535
<i>¶  You might think you know me,
but it's all just a face</i>

203
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,951
<i>¶  Trying to ignore
when people screaming my name</i>

204
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,493
<i>¶  When something's right</i>

205
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:14,827
<i>¶  Then something is worth to die for</i>

206
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:17,535
<i>¶  When I feel
that something is wrong</i>

207
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,951
<i>¶  Then something
is worth to fight for</i>

208
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:24,410
<i>¶  Don't say goodbye</i>

209
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:28,702
<i>¶  Just leave an open door</i>

210
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:31,452
<i>¶  I wanna hear you say</i>

211
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:35,744
<i>¶  You give me
something to die for...</i>

212
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,452
What do you think?

213
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:40,201
Well,
I guess today is the anniversary.

214
00:11:40,286 --> 00:11:43,869
- (Rebecca sighs) Kids.
- No, I meant the display.

215
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:45,160
Oh. (chuckles)

216
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,785
-It's good.
-Told the owner I'd kill his cat
if he didn't get it right.

217
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,785
(chuckles) Nice.

218
00:11:57,805 --> 00:12:00,285
(vibrating cell phone playing "Axel F")

219
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:06,451
(music stops)
(vibration begins/ends)

220
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:13,681
Mmm.

221
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,262
Mm.

222
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:29,797
(car alarm chirps)

223
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,899
(car approaching,
"Cup of Coffee" by The Novocaines blaring)

224
00:12:38,901 --> 00:12:41,240
Ho! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
25, stay alive!

225
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,744
Shit.
Sorry, Sheriff!

226
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,622
Kirby.

227
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,129
("Cup of Coffee" by 
The Novocaines continues)

228
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:52,035
Whoo.

229
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,493
(horn honks)

230
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:06,410
Hey, before you get in the car,
you have to promise not to kill me.

231
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,577
Why? What did you do?

232
00:13:08,661 --> 00:13:11,827
- Trevor called me last night.
- Why is he calling you?

233
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,243
Because you won't take his calls.

234
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:15,785
He knows I have your ear,
and he wants to know.

235
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:19,160
- Know what?
- How upset you are.

236
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:21,201
Can we just not talk about this now,
please?

237
00:13:21,286 --> 00:13:22,744
(softly) Fine. Fine.

238
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:25,327
Okay,
so Trevor called me last night.

239
00:13:25,411 --> 00:13:26,909
He called you, too?

240
00:13:26,994 --> 00:13:28,744
He's worried your cousin
coming to Woodsboro's

241
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:31,327
distracting you from knowing
how sorry he really is.

242
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,693
- Well, that's inventive.
- (chuckling) Oh, God.

243
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,468
(engine starts)

244
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,035
Oh, by the way, have you seen
the Grim Reaper, Angel of Death?

245
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,488
- What are you talking about?
- Your cousin.

246
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:47,378
Last stop on her book tour,

247
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,368
first stop on her road to a new life.
It's very dramatic.

248
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:53,660
She's the reason
why I love horror movies.

249
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:58,243
I'm sure she'd love to hear that.
If I knew her, which I don't really.

250
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,486
Well, wherever she went, people died.
Other people... it was never her.

251
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,562
I mean, "Stab"
is the wrong franchise for her.

252
00:14:05,564 --> 00:14:07,760
It should be "Final Destination."
(cell phone rings)

253
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,607
Okay,
why is Jenny Randall calling me?

254
00:14:10,038 --> 00:14:11,038
I Can not stand Jenny.

255
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,285
- Hello.
- (the voice) Hello, Jill.

256
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:16,577
- Why?
- Shh! Jenny?  Is this you?

257
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:20,923
- What's your favorite scary movie?
- Okay, who is this?

258
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:21,909
What does she want?

259
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,951
(beep)
I said, who is this?

260
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:29,660
(angrily) I asked you a question.
What's your favorite scary movie?

261
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,201
I'm hanging up.
(beep)

262
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,535
Wow. (chuckles)
That was original.

263
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:39,784
I got a call like that this morning
from Marnie the Carny.

264
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:43,660
- What?
- Watch out!
(horn blares, tires squeal)

265
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,993
(man) Nice move, asshole!

266
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:49,452
(panting) You just ran a stop sign.

267
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,076
Sorry.

268
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:55,702
- (sighs)
- Angel of Death.

269
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,993
(Deputy Judy) Mayor wants these down
before lunch.

270
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:05,415
(Joe) Only twenty-five more to go.

271
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:11,076
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.

272
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,029
- Joe.
- Morning, Sheriff.

273
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,160
Looks like the celebration's begun.

274
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:18,868
- High school kids, probably.
- Yeah.

275
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,837
One generation's tragedy
is the next one's joke.

276
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,285
Sorry you can never get away
from this.

277
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:28,535
You know, I wish I'd been old enough
to be part of the force

278
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,327
when you were solving those crimes.

279
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:31,701
Mmm.

280
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:35,368
It's those intense investigations
that really bond relationships.

281
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:38,732
Mmha, yeah.

282
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:41,000
How is Gale, by the way?

283
00:15:41,635 --> 00:15:43,076
Gale's good.
She's writing.

284
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,285
Fiction.

285
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:49,368
Hey, I made some lemon squares.
They're in my car.

286
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,368
Come on...
thanks, Deputy, but no thanks.

287
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,784
Sheriff, you're not cheatin' on your
wife if you eat my lemon square.

288
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,141
Yeah, but I would be
cheatin' on my diet.
(both laugh)

289
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:03,688
<i> (man on radio) :
Sheriff Riley? Come in,
Sheriff Riley!</i>

290
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:05,412
This is Sheriff Riley.
Go ahead.

291
00:16:05,587 --> 00:16:06,951
<i>You gotta get over
to the Randall house right away.</i>

292

real bad.

293

(siren wails, engine starts)
(tire sqeals)

294
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:17,992
(second siren begins)

295
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:23,666
<i>(television) :
The book is "Out of Darkness,"</i>

296
00:16:23,668 --> 00:16:26,620
<i>and its author, Sidney Prescott,

297
00:16:26,622 --> 00:16:28,586
<i>Have the seven "Stab" movies,</i>

298

<i>all based on Gale Weathers'

00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:33,384

300
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:36,125
<i>I don't blame Gale.
That's in the past.</i>

301
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:40,285
<i>If I was a victim for too long,
it was up to me to reinvent myself.</i>

302
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:43,243
<i>- That's why I wrote this book.
- Sidney Prescott, everybody.</i>

303
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:47,215
<i>And rave reviews for her book
"Out of Darkness."</i>

304
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:49,503
All right, Gale, let's do it.

305
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,368
Let's reinvent myself.

306
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:54,213
(sighs)

307
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:56,201
Except...

308
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,882
I have...

309
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,773
no fucking idea...

310
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:02,727
what to...

311
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:03,945
write.

312
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,223
(sighs)

313
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:15,367
Oh, is that new?

314
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,198
That's the 2.0 upgraded version.
I'm totally mobile now.

315
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:20,100
Nice. Look.

316
00:17:20,378 --> 00:17:23,570
Oh, this is "Hall Pass"
with Robbie Mercer,

317
00:17:23,572 --> 00:17:24,964
here with the luscious Olivia

318
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:27,072
"Don't look at my tits, I have a mind" Morris.

319
00:17:27,076 --> 00:17:29,699
Here is my Woodsboro Massacre
anniversary question:

320
00:17:29,768 --> 00:17:31,577
What is your favorite
scary movie?

321
00:17:31,705 --> 00:17:33,790
Is that all you've got?
Some stupid douche
question?

322
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:35,952
Yeah, where'd you
hear that anyways?

323
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:38,092
It's a line from "Stab One," duh!

324
00:17:38,094 --> 00:17:39,165
Hey, Charlie.

325
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,832
You're a--a genre nut, Kirby.
What's your favorite scary movie?

326
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:43,694
- "Bambi."
- Mm mmh.

327
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:45,415
Dork!
- What?

328
00:17:45,517 --> 00:17:47,554
That's funny, Kirby.

329
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:49,410
(girls chuckle)

330
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,490
Completely unaware you exist.

331
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:53,091
No, man, she wants me.

332
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,214
Yeah, I wish,
right, Asshole?

333
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:00,648
I think Charlie likes you.

334
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,118
And I like him.

335
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:05,773
To tease,
to torment,
to make him squirm.

336
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,160
You could do a lot worse,
trust me.

337
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:10,327
(gasps)

338
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:13,513
Oh!   Hi, Trevor.
Bye, Trevor.

339
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:16,035
Can we talk?

340
00:18:17,522 --> 00:18:19,996
Somebody cares about
you over here,
you know?

341
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,160
Someone who made you
really happy once.

342
00:18:23,115 --> 00:18:25,198
Someone who never
should have let you go.

343
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,304
When you're done with a phone call,
you let someone go.

344
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:32,265
Or, when you take
someone to the airport,
you let them go.

345
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:35,438
When you tell someone you love her
and she gives you everything,

346
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,243
and then you just go out
with someone else,

347
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:39,352
that is not letting her go,
that's dumping her.

348
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:43,280
Okay, that's--that's betrayal.
(sighs)

349
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,590
Trevor Sheldon,
denied live on "Hall Pass"
with Robbie Mercer.

350
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,215
What is your favorite scary movie,
man?

351
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:52,210
I'll show you.
(snarls)

352
00:18:58,886 --> 00:19:01,299
<i>(Sidney) :
And I began to believe myself,
that was all I was,</i>

353
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:05,172
<i>a--a victim,
and that was unacceptable to me.</i>

354
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:08,909
<i>So, I sat down...</i>

355
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,410
<i>and began to write
a new role that would be my own,</i>

356
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,433
a role for a woman who could leave
the walls of fear behind

357
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:19,907
and step out into the sunlight,
out of darkness.

358
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:22,477
(applause)
Thank you.

359
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:26,328
(Rebecca) :
Okay, we're gonna
start the book signing in a sec.

360
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,128
So buy your copies while they last.
Lookin' at you, ladies.

361
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,410
New York Times bestseller.
Rave reviews.

362
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,765
Gale.
I'm glad you came.

363
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,555
Congratulations, Sidney.

364
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,663
I haven't had a chance
to read it yet, but--

365
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,909
I know where you can get one.
(chuckles)

366
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:48,136
Dewey!   Hey!

367
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,068
Hey, Sidney.
Gale, you made it.

368
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,856
(sirens wailing, tires screeching)
What's going on, Dewey?

369
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,725
Oh, Sid, I'm sorry,
I gotta do something here.

370
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,773
- Shit!
- I'm really sorry.

371
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:59,243
Excuse me!
This will only take a minute.

372
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:02,246
I need you all to stay where you are
and remain silent.

373
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:04,179
Nobody leaves yet.
The Sheriff thanks you.

374
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:06,727
Can this wait, Barney Fife?
I'm running an event here.

375
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,743
Ma'am, this is a police event now.

376
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:09,932
What's going on?

377
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:12,495
Gale, this is police business.
If you could just let us handle this.

378
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:14,878
I'm talking to my husband,
Deputy Judy.

379
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,161
Listen, there's a phone
we believe

380
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:19,275
may have been taken
from the scene of a crime.

381
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:22,629
Deputy Hicks has traced its location
back to these coordinates.

382
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,743
The rest is need-to-know.

383
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,701
- And I'm not "need-to-know"?
- Shh.

384
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,885
(cell phone ringing)

385
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:32,368
Sheriff, it's ringing out here!

386
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:36,160
(ringing continues)

387
00:20:37,147 --> 00:20:38,368
There!

388
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:41,326
(ringing continues)

389
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,826
- It's coming from the trunk.
- There.

390
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,800
Dewey!
Gonna need everyone to stay back.

391
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:50,795
- Not now, Sid.
- It's my rental.

392
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,106
(ringing continues)

393
00:20:58,432 --> 00:20:59,807
(everyone gasps)

394
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:03,084
- Damn!
- Okay, it's now
an official crime scene.

395
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:05,436
Let's lock it down.
Get that camera outta here!
-It's a crime scene.

396
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:07,883
- Everybody back.
- Gimme that camera.

397
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:09,410
Please tell me this is a prank,
Dewey.

398
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,109
- I'm afraid not, Sid.
- On the curb, ma'am.

399
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,523
- Come on.  - Everybody, get back!
-Step back!   (cell phone dialing)

400
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,593
Henry, you're not gonna believe
what just happened.

401
00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:18,675
Stand back, Gale.
Gale.

402
00:21:18,716 --> 00:21:20,000
I just wanna see.

403
00:21:20,005 --> 00:21:21,118
(man) Cover up your kid's eyes!

404
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:25,682
Okay,
essays are due Tuesday.

405
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,047
"Why Woodsboro is the best--"
(multiple cell phones ringing)

406
00:21:28,736 --> 00:21:31,451
Anything with an on/off switch
should be off, that's the rule!

407
00:21:34,063 --> 00:21:34,829
Somebody wanna share?

408
00:21:35,272 --> 00:21:37,475
Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper
were murdered last night.

409
00:21:37,745 --> 00:21:39,135
- What?
(chattering)

410
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:40,173
What?

411
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,673
Stabbed to death.

412
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,862
- What's your favorite scary movie--
- Shut up!  -Shut up!  -Shut up!

413
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:46,576
- Yo, it's a news van!
- Class is not over!

414
00:21:46,925 --> 00:21:48,059
That was fast.

415
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,963
(woman reporter)
This week marks the anniversary
of the infamous Woodsboro Murders.

416
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:56,971
Two girls killed the exact day
local celebrity victim Sidney Prescott

417
00:21:56,973 --> 00:21:58,920
chose to return to her hometown.

418
00:21:58,922 --> 00:22:01,648
It all could be something right out
of a Gale Weathers' best-seller.

419
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,400
And where is she now?

420
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:05,368
Well, living right here in Woodsboro
as the wife of  Sherrif Dewey Riley--

421
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,681
- Mrs. Riley.
- Hoss.

422
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,243
- First Lady.
- Perkins.

423
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:12,674
Excuse me, Gale, he's
conducting an interview.

424
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,293
Great.
I love interviews.

425
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,515
You'll have to wait, Gale.
Sorry, can't let you in there.

426
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:20,326
(chuckles) What are you gonna do,
arrest me, Deputy Judy?

427
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:23,728
If it comes to it.
Civilian interference
with a police investigation

428
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,628
poses many a problem
in a court of law.

429
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,319
Okay, listen to me, Judy.

430
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:29,849
I don't mind that you're working
with my husband

431
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:33,255
or that you even bake him
those little treats, as you do,

432
00:22:33,463 --> 00:22:34,745
but, if you're gonna start
acting like him,

433
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:37,148
you gotta put a moustache on,
'cause you sound ridiculous.

434
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,601
- Gale!  - Judy!
- Gale! (clears throat)

435
00:22:40,603 --> 00:22:42,637
Deputy.   Gale.

436
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:44,867
(whispering) Please.

437
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:47,545
Uh, Sidney,
if you don't mind givin' us a minute.

438
00:22:47,895 --> 00:22:49,080
- Sid.
- Hi, Gale.

439
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,784
Dewey, would you please explain
to Betty Crocker

440
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:53,993
that I have every right to be here?

441
00:22:55,478 --> 00:22:59,102
If there's been another murder
in Woodsboro, obviously... what?

442
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:01,570
(whispering)
That is not public information!

443
00:23:01,543 --> 00:23:04,375
- It is all over the Internet, Dewey!
- It is?

444
00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:07,294
Yes! The whole world knows
about it before me!

445
00:23:07,249 --> 00:23:09,957
She wants to be a part
of the investigation, Sheriff.

446
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:11,756
(sighs) Hang on.

447
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:17,425
Um, are you familiar with the phrase,
"I wrote the book on this"?

448
00:23:21,155 --> 00:23:24,945
Gale, with all due respect,
I don't see how that pertains to--

449
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,690
Because I wrote the book on this!

450
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:31,503
"The Woodsboro Murders"
by Gale Weathers?

451
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,863
But you're not a reporter
anymore,  Gale.

452
00:23:33,863 --> 00:23:35,478
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- And even if you were...

453
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,760
Don't treat me like I'm the media.

454
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:41,973
I helped solve these things three times,
remember?

455
00:23:41,975 --> 00:23:43,894
You and me.
Together.

456
00:23:43,896 --> 00:23:46,756
(sighs)
But I'm the Sheriff now, Gale.

457
00:23:47,837 --> 00:23:49,241
Right?

458
00:23:50,903 --> 00:23:52,769
What, you're not gonna let me
help you with this?

459
00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:54,326
I can't.

460
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:58,800
All right,
then I'm going rogue.

461
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:00,696
This is what I'm good at,
Dewey.

462
00:24:00,698 --> 00:24:02,977
This is what I know how to do.

463
00:24:04,772 --> 00:24:06,155
(clears throat)

464
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,961
Your lemon squares taste like ass.

465
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:15,693
They don't.
They really don't.

466
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:18,732
- Thank you, sir.
- Sheriff.
- Yeah?

467
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:21,176
We've got a couple
high school kids in here.

468
00:24:21,178 --> 00:24:24,210
Two of 'em, they say they got
threatening phone calls this morning

469
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:25,859
from the victims' phones.

470
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,104
Names are Olivia Morris
and Jill Roberts.

471
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:32,600
That's Sid's cousin.
Damn.

472
00:24:33,715 --> 00:24:34,970
Right in here, Sheriff.

473
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,053
- Hey, Jill.
- Sidney.

474
00:24:37,735 --> 00:24:39,941
- Hi.
- Hi.

475
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:42,414
It's nice to see you
even under the circumstances.

476
00:24:42,468 --> 00:24:44,147
(both chuckle)
You okay?

477
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,955
- Yeah.
- So two of you got phone calls?

478
00:24:46,957 --> 00:24:50,661
Yeah, us two.
"What's your favorite scary movie?"

479
00:24:50,701 --> 00:24:53,783
It was the killer's voice.
From "Stab."

480
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,454
Or, I mean, you know,
from your life.

481
00:24:56,506 --> 00:24:58,962
I'm Kirby, by the way.
I'm their friend.

482
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:01,432
And the killer didn't call you?

483
00:25:01,486 --> 00:25:05,485
No.
Is--is that a bad thing?

484
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,560
Does that mean that I'm not gonna
live as long as these two?

485
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:07,409
(chuckling) No.

486
00:25:07,493 --> 00:25:09,925
No.  Maybe.

487
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:13,915
Of course not.
Just, uh, just be careful.

488
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,061
Oh, my God, did you hear that?
I'm gonna be next!

489
00:25:17,063 --> 00:25:18,974
Dewey, I shouldn't be here.
I should leave town.

490
00:25:19,365 --> 00:25:21,320
I'm afraid that's not really possible,
Sidney.

491
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,601
Look, nobody thinks you're involved,
but everyone's a suspect,
I'm sorry.

492
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,711
And there was evidence in your car,
connecting the killer to you.

493
00:25:29,865 --> 00:25:33,325
You may be a material witness.
- (sighs)

494
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:37,823
So, look, you'll have, uh,
24-hour police surveillance.

495
00:25:38,175 --> 00:25:40,200
That's comforting.

496
00:25:41,758 --> 00:25:43,792
(beep)
This is Rebecca.

497
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:47,778
Oh, my fucking God, Henry!
Yes! It's true.

498
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,771
Two girls butchered.
(chuckles) Payday.

499
00:25:51,164 --> 00:25:54,661
I was so not feeling Woodsboro.
I was like, lame PR move, right?

500
00:25:54,663 --> 00:25:58,514
Well, fuck me wow.
Best idea ever.

501
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,117
Henry, I'll call you back.
(beep)

502
00:26:02,755 --> 00:26:04,796
Excuse me I have to geek out.

503
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:06,318
I didn't get a chance
to say something earlier,

504
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,938
but it's such an honor to meet you.

505
00:26:07,974 --> 00:26:10,348
- Thank you.
- Rebecca Walters.
-  Hi.

506
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:13,234
When I was a kid, it was all about
"Top Story with Gale Weathers."

507
00:26:13,232 --> 00:26:16,564
- (chuckles) You were my '90s.
- Well, it's Gale Riley now.

508
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:18,214
You gave it all up for love,
I know that.

509
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:19,621
How long have you
and Dewey been married?

510
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:21,412
- Ten years.
- Aww!

511
00:26:21,443 --> 00:26:23,692
Just like your characters
in "Stab 3." Wow.

512
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,457
Wow.

513
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,203
Oh, I didn't mean bad wow.

514
00:26:28,205 --> 00:26:30,407
It just, it always seemed like more
of a movie romance than a real one

515
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:33,806
because it was a movie and in real life
you two would never be--

516
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:37,772
Ooh, dug a hole.
(chuckles nervously) Climbing out, here.

517
00:26:37,774 --> 00:26:41,230
So anyway kudos on being brave enough
to drop off the professional map.

518
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,812
Any plans on revitalizing
your tarnished brand?

519
00:26:44,702 --> 00:26:47,552
Listen, in about two seconds, I'm  gonna revitalize your face

520
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:50,882
with my tarnished brand.
- Ooh!

521
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:52,159
I still got it.

522
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,164
Oh, testy!

523
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:02,857
(indistinct talking)

524
00:27:04,092 --> 00:27:06,258
She's so pretty.

525
00:27:06,386 --> 00:27:08,759
I mean when you think about
what she survived, she must have
scars everywhere.

526
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:11,097
- (both) Shh!
- Come on!

527
00:27:11,224 --> 00:27:15,390
Her mom was my sister.
I have scars, too.

528
00:27:15,556 --> 00:27:18,263
No one ever asks me
about my scars.

529
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,190
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Roberts.
- She means knife scars, Mom.

530
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:24,055
Oh.

531
00:27:24,173 --> 00:27:28,006
Well... fine.

532
00:27:28,164 --> 00:27:30,497
How are you?

533
00:27:30,626 --> 00:27:32,792
How's Gale?

534
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:35,931
Uh, I'm all right.

535
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:39,368
But Gale, uh, it's been hard on her.

536
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:43,511
Small town...
small-town husband.

537
00:27:43,736 --> 00:27:46,902
(chuckles humorlessly)
Not much to write about.

538
00:27:47,117 --> 00:27:50,540
You two okay?

539
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:52,994
Well, I read somewhere once,

540
00:27:52,996 --> 00:27:56,366
"Just when you think things can't
get any worse,

541
00:27:56,368 --> 00:27:57,744
"sometimes they don't.

542
00:27:54,746 --> 00:28:00,303
(chuckling)
Sometimes they get better."

543
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:04,194
"Out of Darkness" by Sidney Prescott,
page 220.

544
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:06,986
(both chuckle)

545
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:15,674
Gotta get going.

546
00:28:20,642 --> 00:28:24,375
It's nice to see you, Dewey.
Been through a lot together.

547
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,172
And we'll get through this, too.
Okay?

548
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,435
- Lock up.
- Mm-hmm.

549
00:28:35,043 --> 00:28:38,452
(indistinct police radio chatter)

550
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:45,178
(dog barking)

551
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:52,952
- (gasps)
- Be cool.  It's okay.
Relax, relax. It's just me.

552
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,713
What the hell are you doing here?
There are cops right out front.

553
00:28:55,717 --> 00:28:57,681
No match for the ninja, baby.

554
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,021
(sighs)

555
00:29:00,557 --> 00:29:03,630
Anyway, what are you doing in the house
with Sidney Prescott?

556
00:29:03,632 --> 00:29:06,121
I mean, that's like being on "Top Chef"
with Jeffrey Dahmer.

557
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,999
Can you please get away
from the window?

558
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,235
Y--you have no right to be in here.
Not anymore.

559
00:29:12,237 --> 00:29:13,816
Hang on.

560
00:29:14,435 --> 00:29:16,125
I heard you got a phone call
from the killer.

561
00:29:17,144 --> 00:29:19,755
- Is that true?
- (sighs) What do you care?

562
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:23,077
Don't you think you'd be
a lot safer with me around?

563
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,688
- I don't trust you Trevor.
- Hey.

564
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,815
Then I'm just gonna have
to make sure that you do, all right?

565
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:31,409
(knock on door)

566
00:29:33,246 --> 00:29:34,595
Oh, sorry, I didn't--

567
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:37,620
No, he's just leaving.
It's--it's my ex.

568
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Oh.

569
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:41,199
Yeah.
Her one and only.

570
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,563
- Hi.
- Hi.

571
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,660
It's cool to meet you... officially.

572
00:29:47,455 --> 00:29:50,326
I keep meaning to pick up a copy
of your book, but--

573
00:29:52,072 --> 00:29:53,866
- You're smaller in person.
- (snorts)

574
00:29:55,053 --> 00:29:56,266
(sighs)

575
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,159
(chuckles softly)

576
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:03,349
What?

577
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:06,588
Nothing.   You just, uh...
you remind me of, uh...

578
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,448
...me.

579
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,400
(chuckles softly)

580
00:30:10,456 --> 00:30:12,037
Lock your window, okay?

581
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,649
Yeah.  Good night.

582
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,602
'Night.

583
00:30:16,885 --> 00:30:18,688
- (gasps)
- Sorry about that.

584
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:23,059
<i>(Deputy Judy)
Just makin' my rounds
before takin' off.</i>

585
00:30:23,061 --> 00:30:23,950
Great. Thanks.

586
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,664
<i>Y--You don't remember me,
do ya?</i>

587
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,260
Sorry?

588
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:34,604
<i>We went to high school together.
Judy Hicks?</i>

589
00:30:35,315 --> 00:30:38,910
<i>We had the same homeroom
and Drama Club, too.</i>

590
00:30:39,335 --> 00:30:41,377
<i>We were in "Peter Pan" together.</i>

591
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:43,419
I played a Lost Boy.

592
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,345
You were... Tiger Lily.

593
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,780
I'm sorry,
that was a long time ago.

594
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,509
It's okay, I mean,

595
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:59,564
you had...
a lot of stuff...
goin' on back then.

596
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,557
Well, it's nice to
see you again, Judy.

597
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:06,567
You too.
(door opens,
indistinct radio chatter)

598
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:11,743
(clears throat)
(clears throat)

599
00:31:12,075 --> 00:31:13,352
(man) Everything okay upstairs?

600
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:15,826
You're supposed to be
out front, Perkins.

601
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:20,095
(pop music playing on car radio)

602
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:26,860
What's a 4-letter word
for "courage"?

603
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:28,869
Uh...

604
00:31:29,718 --> 00:31:30,953
"guts."

605
00:31:36,383 --> 00:31:38,207
That's Olivia Morris.
She lives next door.

606
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:39,690
She's on the list.
- Yeah.

607
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,830
She can live next door to me.

608
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,773
(television) :
Now, seriously, uh...
uh, Mary,

609
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:48,579
I'm warning you, okay,
I'm gonna have to get physical.

610
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,925
I mean it. This is it!
- (snarling)

611
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:52,217
Just fuck off!

612
00:31:52,219 --> 00:31:53,660
(growling)

613
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:57,172
(girls laugh)

614
00:31:57,555 --> 00:31:59,003
(cell phone rings)

615
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:05,835
- Hello?
- What are you guys up to?

616
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,829
Oh, we're watching
"Shaun of the Dead."

617
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:10,678
You know there are two zombies
sitting outside the house in a car?

618
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:13,746
Yup. They're cops.
You wanna come up?

619
00:32:13,748 --> 00:32:15,243
The Angel of Death leave?

620
00:32:15,386 --> 00:32:17,512
No, she's in the guest room.
(chuckles)

621
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:19,476
Forget it.
Next door's close enough.

622
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:24,042
- Your mom home?
- She's at her boyfriend's.

623
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:25,622
It's creepy around here tonight.

624
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,996
- (laughs)
-Well, the zombies are
still in their car.

625
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,995
So you should be all right.

626
00:32:31,312 --> 00:32:33,250
- Call me tomorrow, okay?
- All right.

627
00:32:34,206 --> 00:32:36,955
- She didn't wanna come up?
- She fears the Reaper.

628
00:32:37,735 --> 00:32:38,492
Watch this.

629
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:41,159
(television silenced)

630
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,305
(cell phone rings)

631
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:49,476
Speaking.

632
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:53,265
(imitating Ghostface) What's
your favorite scary movie, Olivia?

633
00:32:53,637 --> 00:32:55,610
That's the worst imitation
I've ever heard, Jill.

634
00:32:55,963 --> 00:32:58,321
Speaking of "Stab," you heard
where the Stab-a-Thon's gonna be yet?

635
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:00,681
(beep)
No, and it doesn't matter to me anyways.

636
00:33:00,683 --> 00:33:02,133
My mom doesn't want me to go.

637
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:05,845
(cell phone rings)
(sighs) It's Trevor.

638
00:33:05,847 --> 00:33:09,376
- I'll handle this.
- Trevor's calling.   Again.

639
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:12,793
- What do you want?
- (the voice) I wanna talk to Jill.

640
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:15,498
Uh, no, it's Kirby.
Sorry, Trevor.

641
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,387
Jill is screening her calls
from all past relationships.

642
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:19,757
What's going on over there?

643
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:21,701
Hang on a sec.
What is he saying?

644
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:23,829
<i>(whispers) I'm not Trevor.</i>

645
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:27,145
W--what?
I can barely hear you, Trevor.

646
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,612
<i>This isn't Trevor.</i>

647
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,072
Oh, a--all right.

648
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:34,196
Well, then, why do you have his phone,
whoever this is?

649
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,031
(whispering)
He's trying to do Ghostface.
(laughs)

650
00:33:37,192 --> 00:33:38,705
(chuckles) He's being weird.

651
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,787
<i>I wanna talk to Jill.</i>

652
00:33:40,915 --> 00:33:42,716
Okay, well,
she doesn't wanna talk to you.

653
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:45,757
Come on, Mr. Ghostface,
whisper to me.

654
00:33:46,075 --> 00:33:48,559
Aren't you supposed
to ask me a question?

655
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,645
<i>All right.
How's the movie?</i>

656
00:33:52,087 --> 00:33:53,110
What movie?

657
00:33:53,113 --> 00:33:54,576
<i>"Shaun of the Dead."</i>

658
00:33:56,865 --> 00:33:57,993
How did you know that?

659
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:01,315
<i>Because I'm standing
in the closet.</i>

660
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:03,243
Stop. You are not.

661
00:34:03,615 --> 00:34:05,909
- What's going on?
- Trevor's being weird.

662
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,940
- I mean, if it is him, I don't know.
- What?

663
00:34:08,323 --> 00:34:10,133
<i>This is not fucking Trevor!</i>

664
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:11,880
Well then,
who the fuck are you?

665
00:34:12,415 --> 00:34:14,245
<i>Open the closet door.</i>

666
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:19,390
You do know there are cops
all over this house?

667
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:22,576
<i>I think I'd have just enough time
to slice someone open.</i>

668
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:26,182
- I--I'll talk to him.
- Shh!

669
00:34:27,605 --> 00:34:29,157
What's going on over there,
you guys?

670
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,830
S--Sorry.
I--I don't know, Kirby.

671
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,000
- Shh.
- Kirby.

672
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:36,628
<i>Come on, do it.</i>

673
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,327
There is no way you're in there.

674
00:34:38,612 --> 00:34:40,450
<i>See for yourself.</i>

675
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:43,252
Kirby?

676
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:45,460
Kirby, come on. Talk to me.
This isn't funny.

677
00:34:46,497 --> 00:34:47,579
Kirby!

678
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:49,467
(gasps)

679
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:56,868
Liar. I'm over this.

680
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,140
<i>I never said I was in your closet.</i>

681
00:34:59,657 --> 00:35:00,762
Wha--

682
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,154
(crash)
(Olivia screams)

683
00:35:05,156 --> 00:35:07,649
Oh, my God.
Olivia!

684
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:10,987
(Olivia screaming)
- Oh, my God, help!  -Help!

685
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,893
Aaagh! (gasping)

686
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,546
(crash)

687
00:35:16,165 --> 00:35:17,487
No!

688
00:35:18,155 --> 00:35:19,390
(crash)

689
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:22,496
(Olivia screams)

690
00:35:23,094 --> 00:35:25,446
(crying)
-No!    -No!

691
00:35:25,745 --> 00:35:26,965
Help!

692
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:30,040
(slashing)
(grunting and panting)

693
00:35:34,935 --> 00:35:36,785
Help!
Help!

694
00:35:37,731 --> 00:35:38,731
(slash)

695
00:35:38,865 --> 00:35:40,665
- Hoss!
- Somebody help!

696
00:35:41,135 --> 00:35:42,845
- Perkins!
- (Olivia screams)

697
00:35:43,802 --> 00:35:45,165
Shit!

698
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,084
Help!
Help!

699
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:51,867
(girls screaming)

700
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:56,937
(both screaming)

701
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:59,322
(breaking glass)

702
00:36:00,165 --> 00:36:02,173
(multiple screams and cries)

703
00:36:09,854 --> 00:36:11,991
(panting)

704
00:36:11,993 --> 00:36:16,505
(door creaks)

705
00:36:26,657 --> 00:36:27,975
(gasps)

706
00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:36,533
(cell phone rings)

707
00:36:40,974 --> 00:36:44,796
- What?
- (the voice) Welcome home, Sidney.
Preview of coming events.

708
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,623
Why don't you come for me?
You got the balls for that?

709
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,934
Oh, poor Sidney.
You think this is all about you.

710
00:36:49,936 --> 00:36:53,562
- You think you're still the star.
- This isn't a fucking movie!

711
00:36:53,564 --> 00:36:55,295
- It will be.
- These are innocent people.

712
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,761
<i>(angrily) Spare me the lecture.</i>

713
00:36:56,763 --> 00:36:59,503
<i>You've done very well
by all this bloodshed, haven't you?</i>

714
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:01,385
<i>Well, how about
the town you left behind?</i>

715
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,512
<i>I've got plans for you.</i>

716
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:06,225
<i>I'm gonna slit your eyelids in half
so you don't blink</i>

717
00:37:06,227 --> 00:37:08,021
<i>when I stab you in the face.</i>

718
00:37:08,512 --> 00:37:12,215
<i>You'll die when I want you to, Sidney.
Not a moment before.</i>

719
00:37:12,217 --> 00:37:15,544
<i>Until then...
you're going to suffer.</i>

720
00:37:15,546 --> 00:37:16,651
(click)

721
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:19,023
- Sidney?
- Jill!

722
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:22,000
- Stay right there!
- Is she--

723
00:37:22,003 --> 00:37:23,997
Do not look. Okay?

724
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:26,367
She said
you were the Angel of Death.

725
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:28,945
- Look out!
- (screams)

726
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,942
(grunting and panting)

727
00:37:33,548 --> 00:37:34,751
(glass breaking)

728
00:37:36,743 --> 00:37:38,054
(struggling)

729
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:42,820
(glass breaking)

730
00:37:47,527 --> 00:37:48,860
(kick)

731
00:37:49,923 --> 00:37:51,269
Have a look.
Look over there!

732
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:52,993
He's in here!

733
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:54,442
Where is he?

734
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,870
He was.
- (police radio) :
What is your status?

735
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,844
- Jill?
- (breathes heavily) Don't.

736
00:38:07,778 --> 00:38:10,277
(wimpering)

737
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:15,938
- What happened?
- (Jill whimpering)

738
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,034
Oh, my God, Jill.

739
00:38:19,457 --> 00:38:23,600
Jesus!..     I'll hold you up!
Hey, come on, let's go.
Let's go.

740
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,753
I'll take care of you,
all right?  I got it.

741
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,242
Jill?

742
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:29,433
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

743
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:32,379
- Here, keep pressure on it.
- There's nobody back there.

744
00:38:34,323 --> 00:38:35,647
- I'll call it in.
- Right.

745
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:38,769
Hey.
Are you okay?

746
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:41,907
You should look upstairs.

747
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:53,186
(indistinct conversations)

748
00:38:53,815 --> 00:38:56,295
<i>(woman) Let's get the coroner's van
brought around, please.</i>

749
00:38:58,865 --> 00:39:00,197
(indistinct radio chatter)

750
00:39:01,418 --> 00:39:02,660
<i>(woman 2) You've got to move over!</i>

751
00:39:06,265 --> 00:39:07,895
<i>(woman 3) It's all your fault, Sidney!</i>

752
00:39:08,703 --> 00:39:10,098
<i>(woman 4) Just like your mother!</i>

753
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:13,614
<i>(man) What's going on?
- (man 2) Come on! </i>

754
00:39:16,243 --> 00:39:17,872
I'm sorry about what I said.

755
00:39:19,906 --> 00:39:21,550
Do you wanna go
get that looked at?

756
00:39:22,615 --> 00:39:23,845
Yeah.

757
00:39:25,676 --> 00:39:27,115
What the hell happened?

758
00:39:27,425 --> 00:39:30,973
Okay.   I saw him go into that yard
two houses down right before--

759
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:33,349
Yeah, and I circled around
to cut him off.

760
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,308
And?

761
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,428
And I met Hoss coming
from the other direction.

762
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:40,195
No, no, he must've circled
back around somehow.
He's like a ghost.

763
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:43,774
- Chief, we're sorry.
- We feel terrible.

764
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:47,098
(sighs)   All right.
Get outta here.

765
00:39:51,452 --> 00:39:53,545
(siren wails)

766
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:58,465
(exhales loudly)

767
00:40:00,728 --> 00:40:02,207
This is "Hall Pass" with Robbie Mercer,

768
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:04,672
webcasting live in our darkest hour.

769
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,067
What began as
a day of remembrance
has ended with serial murder.

770
00:40:08,415 --> 00:40:11,968
Olivia Morris, who officially
will never go out with me, is dead.

771
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:13,995
So is Jenny Randall
and Marnie Cooper.

772
00:40:14,506 --> 00:40:18,120
Our local legacy, the "Stab" movies,
is coming to life.

773
00:40:18,288 --> 00:40:21,028
Excuse me.
Are you recording
with that thing?

774
00:40:21,515 --> 00:40:23,992
Live video-blog upload.
He's webcasting right now.

775
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:26,886
Oh!   Mind turning it off
for a little old-school off the record?

776
00:40:27,062 --> 00:40:28,717
Can't.
Owe it to my audience.

777
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,097
Turn that fucking thing off.

778
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:31,957
Okay.

779
00:40:33,342 --> 00:40:35,451
So, you two are the boys that run

780
00:40:35,452 --> 00:40:37,560
the movie club at Woodsboro High, huh?

781
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:40,635
Well, Charlie runs it.
I'm just V.P. In case he takes a bullet

782
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:41,938
It's called Cinema Club.

783
00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:45,741
So you must have
a very unique insight
into the movie buffs at your school.

784
00:40:47,272 --> 00:40:48,512
Maybe.

785
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:52,641
What if we could catch the killer
by working together?

786
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:55,498
Two generations
of cutting-edge journalists

787
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,500
intertwining our
passions for media?

788
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:00,576
What would you say?

789
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:02,239
I love you.

790
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,702
Hmm, very good.

791
00:41:04,144 --> 00:41:07,957
Now you give me
your expertise on the gore geek scene
at Woodsboro High

792
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:10,179
and maybe I give you
something in return.

793
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:14,024
Say, a celebrity visit to
your Cinema Club?
(laughs)

794
00:41:14,758 --> 00:41:16,048
By me.

795
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:18,904
What about Sidney?

796
00:41:20,005 --> 00:41:22,893
- What about Sidney?
- Yeah, you know her, right?
- I mean, you're friends with her?

797
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:26,775
No offense, but
that'd be a big deal
for Cinema Club.

798
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:30,017
A visit from Sidney Prescott?
I mean, she's the star.

799
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:32,046
(chuckles bitterly) Yes, she's

800
00:41:32,047 --> 00:41:34,073
Daniel Radcliffe to my J.K. Rowling.

801
00:41:34,656 --> 00:41:36,568
Well... without the book sales
and the box office.

802
00:41:37,732 --> 00:41:39,184
Whatever.

803
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:43,517
There's no broken bones.

804
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:46,290
I think you'll be fine.
Now we just...  take a
couple of weeks off.

805
00:41:46,868 --> 00:41:48,079
(indistinct hospital p.a.)

806
00:41:49,738 --> 00:41:51,841
So, Sidney, ooh, ow.
(chuckles)

807
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:53,740
Anyway, long story short,

808
00:41:53,742 --> 00:41:56,590
Random wants to lock you in
to three more books... now!

809
00:41:57,026 --> 00:42:00,606
See the blank line in your contract?
You can name your price.

810
00:42:00,608 --> 00:42:02,331
And as soon as you're clear
in this investigation,

811
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,123
we're on the
next plane to New York.

812
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:07,345
I  booked  "Today,"  "The View,"
"Nancy Grace,"  "MTV News"--

813
00:42:07,347 --> 00:42:09,197
Excuse me.
Can I ask you a question?

814
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:11,701
- Mm?
- Did you read my book?

815
00:42:13,642 --> 00:42:15,097
Thought I'd wait for the movie.
(nervous laugh)

816
00:42:16,148 --> 00:42:17,184
Book tour's over.

817
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:18,325
Sidney.

818
00:42:19,645 --> 00:42:21,315
Accept your situation.

819
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,712
You're a victim.
For life.

820
00:42:23,714 --> 00:42:26,797
So embrace it, use it.

821
00:42:27,702 --> 00:42:28,702
I know you care
about your readers.

822
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,544
All those little downtrodden fucks
that just need a light

823
00:42:31,546 --> 00:42:33,791
at the end of their tunnel
so they don't jump off a bridge.

824
00:42:33,793 --> 00:42:35,215
And a lucky break like this?

825
00:42:35,217 --> 00:42:38,351
I'm talkin' 100% increase
in sales, minimum.

826
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,611
That's maybe a million more people
get your message,

827
00:42:40,672 --> 00:42:42,565
and you get a ton more checks.

828
00:42:42,866 --> 00:42:43,930
Win-win.

829
00:42:43,932 --> 00:42:47,524
(exhales)
I won't be needing you anymore.

830
00:42:47,714 --> 00:42:49,432
- Sidney.
- You're fired

831
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,406
- Fired?
- Fired.

832
00:42:53,189 --> 00:42:54,354
Fine.

833
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,722
(running footsteps)
(door opens)

834
00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:12,353
(elevator bell)

835
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,334
"Have you even read my book,
Rebecca?"

836
00:43:19,921 --> 00:43:23,106
(odd mechanical sounds)

837
00:43:29,745 --> 00:43:31,181
(sighs softly)

838
00:43:32,118 --> 00:43:34,334
The problem with Sidney
is that she never gets laid.

839
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,259
Or even a little shit-faced
once in a while.

840
00:43:37,924 --> 00:43:39,561
She'll call me tonight
and apologize.

841
00:43:39,563 --> 00:43:41,633
(elevator bell)
Just watch.

842
00:43:48,311 --> 00:43:49,668
She'll come around.

843
00:43:50,663 --> 00:43:55,017
Gotta just give her time,
and Sidney will come 'a-round.'

844
00:43:56,473 --> 00:43:58,166
Where did I?

845
00:43:58,395 --> 00:44:01,070
(car alarm chirps)
(chirps again)

846
00:44:01,588 --> 00:44:04,440
Ah.
(cell phone rings)

847
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:08,379
This is Rebecca.

848
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:10,523
<i>(the voice) Sidney Prescott, please.</i>

849
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,746
I'm handling Miss Prescott's calls
and appearances.  May I take a message?

850
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,144
<i>You are the message.</i>

851
00:44:20,131 --> 00:44:21,608
<i>Are you writing this down?</i>

852
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:23,351
Yes, I am.

853
00:44:23,437 --> 00:44:25,960
It's kind of hard to hear you.
I'm in the hospital with Sidney.

854
00:44:26,374 --> 00:44:27,874
If you could just
hang on one second.

855
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:29,953
<i>(chuckles)   I've got time.</i>

856
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:31,851
<i>It's you that doesn't.</i>

857
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,896
(car alarm blares)

858
00:44:39,898 --> 00:44:43,511
<i>You know, Rebecca,
it doesn't sound to me like
you're in the hospital.  (she gasps)</i>

859
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,147
<i>Sounds like you're in a parking garage.</i>

860
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,428
<i>A dark and deserted
parking garage.</i>

861
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:55,550
But if you want to be in the hospital,
I'd be happy to put you there.

862
00:44:55,722 --> 00:44:57,317
<i>In the morgue!</i>

863
00:45:13,037 --> 00:45:14,450
(cell phone rings)
(keys drop to floor)
Aagh!

864
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,924
Shit!

865
00:45:16,842 --> 00:45:19,395
(phone continues ringing)
No!

866
00:45:20,726 --> 00:45:21,936
(keys jangle)

867
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:26,420
(engine tries to turn over)

868
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:29,451
(tries engine again)

869
00:45:39,021 --> 00:45:40,720
(Rebecca screams)

870
00:45:44,412 --> 00:45:45,825
Help!

871
00:45:46,635 --> 00:45:48,435
Help!   Help me!

872
00:45:48,451 --> 00:45:50,052
(tires squeal)
(Rebecca screams)

873
00:45:54,593 --> 00:45:55,905
Whoo!

874
00:46:03,835 --> 00:46:06,232
Cut and run,
you fucking bastard.

875
00:46:12,547 --> 00:46:14,225
(doors unlocking)

876
00:46:38,146 --> 00:46:39,800
(car alarm blaring)
(screams)

877
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:47,602
Huh.

878
00:46:55,216 --> 00:46:56,430
Huh.

879
00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:01,571
Huh!

880
00:47:01,702 --> 00:47:03,378
(screams)

881
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,712
(silence)

882
00:47:08,657 --> 00:47:09,657
(slash)

883
00:47:15,195 --> 00:47:17,400
(Dewey) :  This is an ongoing investigation.

884
00:47:18,216 --> 00:47:21,588
Rest assured, we're pursuing
a number of leads.

885
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:23,953
- Sheriff!
- The less I say about that,
the better.  -Sheriff!

886
00:47:24,915 --> 00:47:27,963
- So I'm taking questions.
- Sheriff! Sheriff!  - Sheriff.  - Sheriff!
- Sheriff!    - Sheriff.

887
00:47:28,294 --> 00:47:30,002
- Dewey!
- Gale?

888
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,843
Any comment on the fact
that these killings

889
00:47:31,845 --> 00:47:35,238
seem to resemble the pattern
of the original Woodsboro Murders?

890
00:47:35,798 --> 00:47:37,724
Hon? (feedback)
(whispers)   Later.

891
00:47:38,808 --> 00:47:39,944
<i>(woman) What was that, Sheriff?</i>

892
00:47:39,946 --> 00:47:43,943
As I was saying, uh,
my officers are hard at work,

893
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:47,576
and we just want the community
to know that we are very close

894
00:47:47,578 --> 00:47:50,575
to bringing this whole situation
under control--
(woman screams)

895
00:47:51,227 --> 00:47:52,514
(all scream)

896
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,090
(crash)

897
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:00,708
Someone, get up to the top
of the structure! Go, go!

898
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:03,899
- Everyone back! Stay back!
- All right, nobody move!

899
00:48:03,906 --> 00:48:05,886
Listen, I want a man
on each stairwell!

900
00:48:08,696 --> 00:48:10,972
- You see anybody?
-  (radio) Nobody up here.

901
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:12,845
There's nobody up there, Sheriff!

902
00:48:14,957 --> 00:48:16,747
It's all under control,
huh, Sheriff?

903
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,346
What am I supposed to say?

904
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:21,643
Listen, I may not be
wearing a uniform,

905
00:48:21,645 --> 00:48:23,805
but I happen to have a lead,
and you don't.

906
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,736
So let me know when
you're back on 'Team Gale.'

907
00:48:29,857 --> 00:48:31,445
Move it, amateurs!

908
00:48:36,941 --> 00:48:39,450
(chattering)

909
00:48:41,862 --> 00:48:44,210
Okay, Cinema Club.
We are now in session.

910
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:47,326
Welcome.  Tell you a
little bit about ourselves,

911
00:48:47,328 --> 00:48:50,010
We are a sanctioned
after-school activity,

912
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,542
one rung below the Glee Club,
two above Nintendo Wii Fit.
(sparse laughs)

913
00:48:54,628 --> 00:48:58,285
And (chuckles) let me just say
to our guest, Sidney Prescott,

914
00:48:59,015 --> 00:49:01,043
it's an honor.
(applause)

915
00:49:03,476 --> 00:49:05,628
Beyond Jamie Lee Curtis,
forget Linda Blair.

916
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,499
I mean, this is the ultimate.

917
00:49:08,063 --> 00:49:09,678
Thanks. I guess.

918
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,198
Um this,
you film your entire
high school experience

919
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,722
and, what?
Post it on the net?

920
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,618
Everybody'll be doing it
someday, Sid.

921
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,861
It's kind of the one component
the killer is missing.

922
00:49:18,863 --> 00:49:20,319
Wait.
What do you mean?

923
00:49:21,437 --> 00:49:23,958
Well, if you wanna be
the new, new version,

924
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,699
the killer
should be filming the murders.

925
00:49:26,018 --> 00:49:28,722
It's like the natural next step
in a psycho slasher innovation.

926
00:49:28,961 --> 00:49:31,261
I mean, you film 'em all real-time,
and then before you get caught,

927
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:34,752
you upload 'em into cyberspace.
- Making your art as immortal as you.

928
00:49:36,113 --> 00:49:37,693
- Not to implicate him.
- Not to implicate me.

929
00:49:37,695 --> 00:49:39,563
So who do you think
is behind the murders?

930
00:49:40,729 --> 00:49:43,264
(beep)
Well, it's a "Stab" fanatic clearly.

931
00:49:43,761 --> 00:49:46,473
Working on less of a shriekquel and...
and more of a scream-make.

932
00:49:46,475 --> 00:49:49,223
- Copyrighted terms, by the way.
- 'Cause all there are now are remakes.

933
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,764
Only horror the studios green-light.
I mean,

934
00:49:51,981 --> 00:49:53,263
- Psst.
- There are still rules.

935
00:49:53,265 --> 00:49:56,103
But the rules have changed.
The unexpected is the new cliché.

936
00:49:56,105 --> 00:49:59,002
Yeah, you gotta have an opening sequence
that blows the doors off,

937
00:49:59,005 --> 00:50:00,197
dial up some flashy
music-video direction,

938
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,945
and the kills gotta be
way more extreme.

939
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,808
Modern audiences get savvy
to the rules of the originals.

940
00:50:06,225 --> 00:50:07,915
So the reversals
become the new standard.

941
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,349
In fact, the only surefire way
to survive a modern horror movie?

942
00:50:12,086 --> 00:50:15,904
You pretty much have to be gay.
(light chuckling)

943
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:20,122
So why are you
so sure that the killer's
working by the rules of a horror remake?

944
00:50:20,438 --> 00:50:21,726
Well, the original "Stab" structure
is pretty apparent.

945
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,141
Yeah, two kids killed in a house when
their parents are away?

946
00:50:25,143 --> 00:50:27,758
And then the school's hot chick
savaged beyond recognition.

947
00:50:28,142 --> 00:50:30,566
- We all know where it goes from there.
- A party.

948
00:50:31,472 --> 00:50:33,346
Exactly. A party.

949
00:50:33,775 --> 00:50:35,835
Guaranteed third-act
main cast bloodbath.

950
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:37,899
Fingers crossed on some
nudity for a change.

951
00:50:38,419 --> 00:50:39,835
(light laughter)

952
00:50:40,307 --> 00:50:42,164
Okay, so do you know of a party
that's happening tonight?

953
00:50:43,613 --> 00:50:45,295
Well, there's Stab-a-Thon.

954
00:50:46,468 --> 00:50:47,699
Stab-a-Thon?

955
00:50:47,963 --> 00:50:51,228
Uh, it's a movie marathon.
All seven "Stabs" back-to-back.

956
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,174
- We do it every year.
- And it's tonight?

957
00:50:53,533 --> 00:50:57,767
(scoffs) There's a killer out there
patterning his murders after
the original movie.

958
00:50:57,769 --> 00:50:59,296
I know.
It's pretty wild.

959
00:50:59,366 --> 00:51:03,231
- Well, you have to call it off.
- Um, okay, I mean, it's Friday.

960
00:51:03,233 --> 00:51:05,756
I'm sure we're not the only party
that's goin' on in Woodsboro.

961
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:08,165
Where is this circle jerk
gonna take place?

962
00:51:08,914 --> 00:51:12,424
- So who's ready for this Q and A?
- No, no. I really want the location.

963
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:14,395
You know, it's kind
of an underground thing.

964
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,282
E-mail invites, pretty secret.

965
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,672
(chuckles)
What, you're not gonna tell me?

966
00:51:19,495 --> 00:51:20,459
Really?

967
00:51:20,739 --> 00:51:23,794
We're working together.
Remember?

968
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,213
(swallows)
So you ready for that Q and A?

969
00:51:26,215 --> 00:51:28,817
- Fuck you.
- Let's go.

970
00:51:29,473 --> 00:51:34,135
(chuckles softly)
That was awesome.

971
00:51:34,585 --> 00:51:36,903
<i>- No one brings the girls,
unless we say so.
- Got it!</i>

972
00:51:36,905 --> 00:51:38,365
(sighs)
I feel like I'm under
house arrest.

973
00:51:54,252 --> 00:51:57,294
You know when people say,
"I know how you feel,"

974
00:51:59,252 --> 00:52:01,533
but you know they're just saying that
because they really have

975
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,114
no frigging idea how you feel?

976
00:52:06,995 --> 00:52:08,345
I know how you feel.

977
00:52:10,806 --> 00:52:15,096
I... am so sorry about Olivia.

978
00:52:19,828 --> 00:52:21,614
I'm sorry about your publicist.

979
00:52:27,147 --> 00:52:31,203
How do you handle it?
People staring at you all the time?

980
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:33,800
People stare at me?

981
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:35,882
(both chuckle)

982
00:52:35,884 --> 00:52:37,719
I could never handle
that kind of attention.

983
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:40,738
I just... feel like it would
take over your whole life.

984
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:45,646
Ah--

985
00:52:47,045 --> 00:52:48,553
What I do is I...

986
00:52:49,473 --> 00:52:51,442
try not to think about me.

987
00:52:54,322 --> 00:52:57,493
I have people I care about.
I focus on them.

988
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:02,227
And the rest, it, um,
it works out.

989
00:53:05,145 --> 00:53:06,909
You saved my life last night.

990
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:10,535
I mean, I know we're family,
but you hardly know me.

991
00:53:11,971 --> 00:53:13,684
Makes me wonder, you know, if

992
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:16,789
...I'd have been brave enough
to do the same thing.

993
00:53:18,959 --> 00:53:21,170
I really hope you never
have to find that out.

994
00:53:25,242 --> 00:53:28,160
Well, if you need me,
you know where to find me.

995
00:53:28,472 --> 00:53:31,572
I'll be up in my cell,
or, I mean, my room.

996
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:59,046
Her room's all boarded up.
That's the view from my cell.

997
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:01,504
(sighs) It's really weird.

998
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,900
<i>(Kirby) I think Olivia
would understand, okay?</i>

999
00:54:03,902 --> 00:54:05,587
<i>She'd want me to be
around other people.</i>

1000
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:07,951
Holy shit.
(door shuts)

1001
00:54:07,964 --> 00:54:11,019
Even if I did just crash-land
on 'Planet Dork'--

1002
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:15,561
Speaking of which,
Trevor's here.
- Hey, Kirby.

1003
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:17,910
<i>What is he doing there?
That is so not his scene.</i>

1004
00:54:17,912 --> 00:54:20,179
I have no idea.
Maybe he thought you would be here.

1005
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,985
<i>Yeah, fat chance.
After what happened last night?</i>

1006
00:54:22,987 --> 00:54:26,156
<i>I mean, my mom
is just completely freaked out.
It's not pretty.</i>

1007
00:54:25,158 --> 00:54:29,885
All right, look, you go do
your "good girl" thing, and I will
drink for the both of us.

1008
00:54:30,275 --> 00:54:31,435
I will keep you posted.

1009
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,352
All right. Be safe.

1010
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,384
(rock music playing,
indistinct conversations)

1011
00:55:16,526 --> 00:55:17,968
(crowd chanting in unison) Stab-a-thon!
Stab-a-thon! Stab-a-thon!

1012
00:55:20,413 --> 00:55:21,745
(applause and cheers)

1013
00:55:23,254 --> 00:55:24,256
Thank you!

1014
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:25,697
(crowd cheering--indistiguishable)

1015
00:55:26,192 --> 00:55:27,453
Mmm.

1016
00:55:28,147 --> 00:55:31,506
Cinema Club thanks you for coming out
for our third annual Stab-a-thon.

1017
00:55:31,508 --> 00:55:33,789
(cheers and applause)
Safety in numbers, my friends!
Safety within the walls.

1018
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:36,600
Who's ready to drink every time
someone can't get a cell phone signal?
(cheers and applause)

1019
00:55:37,743 --> 00:55:40,123
Who's ready to drink every time
someone shuts the refrigerator door,

1020
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:44,089
and oh, my God, there's a harmless
character right behind it?
(hooting and cheering)

1021
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:46,143
Who's ready to drink every time
someone screams the word...

1022
00:55:47,226 --> 00:55:49,009
(all) No!

1023
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:52,538
So let's get this
Stab-a-thon started!
(audience applause and cheers)

1024
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:56,852
(eerie music plays)

1025
00:56:04,388 --> 00:56:06,368
(cheers and applause)

1026
00:56:07,043 --> 00:56:09,157
<i>- Hey, watch it!
- Get out of the way!</i>

1027
00:56:10,852 --> 00:56:14,256
<i>- Down in front!
- Move your ass!</i>

1028
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:16,776
<i>- Screw you!
(angry shouting)</i>

1029
00:56:21,605 --> 00:56:22,957
(dramatic music playing)

1030
00:56:37,283 --> 00:56:38,619
(glass shatters,
audience cheering)

1031
00:56:45,512 --> 00:56:46,830
(audience hooting)

1032
00:56:52,285 --> 00:56:53,593
(from film) Yes!

1033
00:56:55,272 --> 00:56:56,684
(thunder crashes on film,
audience cheers)

1034
00:57:00,164 --> 00:57:02,341
Oh, yeah!
Back on my game.

1035
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:05,224
(exhales) Perfect!

1036
00:57:05,298 --> 00:57:07,555
New work-in-progress,
chapter one.
(exhales)

1037
00:57:07,732 --> 00:57:11,354
When I moved to Woodsboro,
I never in a million years dreamed

1038
00:57:11,356 --> 00:57:14,517
that I would again play
the critical role

1039
00:57:14,517 --> 00:57:16,830
in solving another series of these--

1040
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:27,402
What the hell?

1041
00:57:48,955 --> 00:57:50,302
(cell phone rings)

1042
00:57:50,504 --> 00:57:51,842
Gale, where are you?

1043
00:57:52,049 --> 00:57:54,000
I followed the kids to the Stab-a-thon.

1044
00:57:54,289 --> 00:57:57,265
There's an old abandoned farm
on Fort Dillon Road.

1045
00:57:57,612 --> 00:57:59,020
Listen, I've got it
under surveillance,
and I--I

1046
00:57:59,022 --> 00:58:00,936
...I think the killer's
about to make his move.

1047
00:58:01,717 --> 00:58:03,301
What makes you so sure?

1048
00:58:04,445 --> 00:58:06,323
You do a remake
to out-do the original,

1049
00:58:06,324 --> 00:58:07,500
that's what the kids said.

1050
00:58:07,503 --> 00:58:09,384
This party
is all about the "Stab" movies.

1051
00:58:09,388 --> 00:58:11,788
Come on!
How 'meta' can you get?

1052
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,215
How "what-a" can you get?

1053
00:58:14,554 --> 00:58:15,960
I don't know.
I heard them say it.

1054
00:58:16,481 --> 00:58:18,994
Dewey, listen to me,
you have to get out here.

1055
00:58:19,485 --> 00:58:21,823
Come on, you catch the killer,
I get the story.

1056
00:58:21,825 --> 00:58:22,997
It's a win-win.

1057
00:58:23,172 --> 00:58:25,326
(sarcastically)
Well, I thought you
were going rogue, Gale.

1058
00:58:25,504 --> 00:58:27,622
Oh, co...  are you serious?
Come on!

1059
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:30,774
(sighs)  Forget it!
Thanks for having faith in me!

1060
00:58:31,792 --> 00:58:33,613
I gotta fix my equipment.
(beep)

1061
00:58:33,856 --> 00:58:35,108
Gale!

1062
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,640
Shit!

1063
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,139
(siren wails)

1064
00:58:46,244 --> 00:58:48,081
<i>(audience man) Why don't you get
more comfortable, baby?</i>

1065
00:58:49,424 --> 00:58:50,736
(whistles and cat calls)

1066
00:58:51,248 --> 00:58:52,704
(cheers)

1067
00:58:54,176 --> 00:58:57,994
(tipsy) Bravo.
Well... very well done!
Very... I'm very impressed.

1068
00:58:58,405 --> 00:59:00,881
Kind of... kind of impressed.
Not really.

1069
00:59:01,648 --> 00:59:04,242
- That'll do.
- Yeah?  - Yeah.
- I mean she wants it.  - Yeah

1070
00:59:04,282 --> 00:59:05,604
(telephone rings)

1071
00:59:08,677 --> 00:59:10,010
(audience groans)

1072
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:13,315
(cheers and applause)
Ghostface! Yeah!

1073
00:59:18,882 --> 00:59:20,450
(woman) Don't answer it!

1074
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:25,274
- Hello?
- (Ghostface) Hello.

1075
00:59:26,332 --> 00:59:27,379
Who is this?

1076
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:30,476
(audience mimicking dialogue)
- Were you expecting somebody?
- Hello?

1077
00:59:36,098 --> 00:59:37,465
(indistinct police radio chatter)

1078
00:59:37,889 --> 00:59:41,514
(audience talking along)
You know, I don't even know you,
and I dislike you already.

1079
00:59:41,685 --> 00:59:43,570
Hicks, how far are you
from Fort Dillon Road?

1080
00:59:43,972 --> 00:59:46,264
- Five minutes at the most, sir.
- Well, step on it.

1081
00:59:46,414 --> 00:59:47,583
(tense music playing)

1082
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:49,819
(Ghostface) Look out your window.

1083
00:59:50,117 --> 00:59:52,326
(glass breaking)
(audience screaming)

1084
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:27,282
(camera whirring)

1085
01:00:35,394 --> 01:00:37,582
Gale!
Gale, behind you!

1086
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,237
(gasps)

1087
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,814
(slash)

1088
01:00:44,328 --> 01:00:45,495
(screams nearly drowned-out by audience)

1089
01:00:50,082 --> 01:00:51,324
Aah!

1090
01:00:51,974 --> 01:00:53,207
(grunts)

1091
01:00:54,522 --> 01:00:55,924
Gale!

1092
01:00:57,901 --> 01:00:59,687
(screaming)

1093
01:01:01,434 --> 01:01:02,489
(onscreen woman screams)

1094
01:01:06,641 --> 01:01:07,843
(grunts)

1095
01:01:08,283 --> 01:01:09,493
Aaah!

1096
01:01:10,927 --> 01:01:12,137
Freeze!

1097
01:01:12,723 --> 01:01:13,897
(gunshot)

1098
01:01:14,952 --> 01:01:16,202
(slash)

1099
01:01:16,597 --> 01:01:17,808
Unh!

1100
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:19,983
(screams from audience)

1101
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:22,365
(gunshot)

1102
01:01:23,983 --> 01:01:25,295
(all screaming)

1103
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:26,821
Get out of the way,
you morons!

1104
01:01:29,707 --> 01:01:30,917
(slams)

1105
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:34,102
Damn it!

1106
01:01:37,257 --> 01:01:38,766
Okay, put pressure on that.

1107
01:01:39,297 --> 01:01:40,530
Did you catch him?

1108
01:01:41,086 --> 01:01:43,833
No. Hopefully your cameras
caught something.

1109
01:01:43,835 --> 01:01:45,878
- They weren't the only ones Dewey.
- What?

1110
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,309
There's a webcam
that's hidden up there.

1111
01:01:49,077 --> 01:01:51,594
- It was watching me.
- A webcam?

1112
01:01:52,222 --> 01:01:53,642
He's recording the murders.

1113
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:55,032
What?

1114
01:01:55,101 --> 01:01:58,416
This time... he's
making the movie.

1115
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:07,121
Sidney Prescott detail.
Man, I don't... like it.

1116
01:02:08,047 --> 01:02:09,926
The cops guarding the house,
they always get it.

1117
01:02:11,568 --> 01:02:13,859
- What are you talkin' about?
- It's a movie cop rule.

1118
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:16,775
Sucks to be a cop in a movie,
unless you're Bruce Willis.

1119
01:02:18,061 --> 01:02:20,033
Not all cops die in movies.

1120
01:02:20,729 --> 01:02:24,246
No, but if it's your last day
before retirement, you do.

1121
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:27,930
If you're a rookie, just found out
your wife is pregnant, you do.

1122
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:32,231
Or if your partner's better-looking
than you, you do, and by the way...

1123
01:02:32,233 --> 01:02:33,532
(both) I win that one.

1124
01:02:33,737 --> 01:02:35,381
(both chuckle)

1125
01:02:35,588 --> 01:02:37,246
You know what?
I'll take the next perimeter.

1126
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:38,677
I'll be right back.

1127
01:02:40,962 --> 01:02:43,529
Shit!  I know this one.

1128
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:45,002
You're not supposed to
say that, are you?

1129
01:02:45,004 --> 01:02:46,698
Eh, new decade, new rules.

1130
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,525
You know, these days,
you might come back, find me dead,

1131
01:02:49,527 --> 01:02:51,543
eyes gouged out,
tongue sticking out.

1132
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,217
- Could go either way.
- I gotta learn this shit.
-Okay...

1133
01:02:55,361 --> 01:02:56,792
(chuckles) I'll take this one.

1134
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,429
Hey, Hoss,

1135
01:03:01,575 --> 01:03:02,574
Be careful.

1136
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:04,015
I'm always careful.

1137
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:09,535
Dead man walking.

1138
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,325
(cat screeches then yowls)

1139
01:03:19,553 --> 01:03:21,065
(wind chimes tinkling)

1140
01:03:29,404 --> 01:03:30,778
(wind chimes continue)

1141
01:03:48,127 --> 01:03:49,481
(crickets)

1142
01:04:00,148 --> 01:04:02,613
Perkins, was there a window open
on your last perimeter check?

1143
01:04:06,054 --> 01:04:07,678
Perkins, come in, over.

1144
01:04:09,357 --> 01:04:14,092
(dog barking in distance)

1145
01:04:26,632 --> 01:04:27,847
(door creaks)

1146
01:04:38,473 --> 01:04:39,528
(whispers) Anthony?

1147
01:04:41,313 --> 01:04:42,695
(whispering) Perkins?

1148
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:45,719
- Aaah!
- Ohh!

1149
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:48,166
- (laughs)
- Damn it.

1150
01:04:48,755 --> 01:04:51,444
You should've seen the look
on your face, rookie.

1151
01:04:52,713 --> 01:04:54,170
- (strangled grunt)
- Hoss!

1152
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:56,701
What the fuck? Aah!

1153
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,330
Oh, shit.

1154
01:04:59,867 --> 01:05:01,077
Ugh.

1155
01:05:03,262 --> 01:05:04,472
Aaah!

1156
01:05:09,748 --> 01:05:10,984
Hoss!

1157
01:05:11,563 --> 01:05:12,618
Uah.

1158
01:05:12,963 --> 01:05:14,040
(grunts)

1159
01:05:17,696 --> 01:05:18,751
Aigh!
(dogs barking in distance)

1160
01:05:21,642 --> 01:05:22,719
(dogs barking in distance)

1161
01:05:27,514 --> 01:05:28,716
Fuck Bruce Willis.

1162
01:05:33,144 --> 01:05:35,505
(wind chimes tinkling)

1163
01:05:38,787 --> 01:05:39,865
(floor creaking)

1164
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:43,180
(chimes and creaking)

1165
01:05:48,558 --> 01:05:49,779
(chimes & dogs barking)

1166
01:05:58,052 --> 01:06:01,105
Sorry!
The wind chimes were over here.

1167
01:06:01,215 --> 01:06:03,126
That was me.
I was trying to fix 'em, sorry.

1168
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:06,784
I'm just back from the store.

1169
01:06:07,445 --> 01:06:08,449
You're shopping?

1170
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:11,616
My stress buster.
Got one more bag in the car.

1171
01:06:11,804 --> 01:06:12,991
I'll Be right back.

1172
01:06:15,061 --> 01:06:16,105
(door creaks)

1173
01:06:20,487 --> 01:06:21,596
(dogs barking)

1174
01:06:24,484 --> 01:06:25,694
(telephone rings)

1175
01:06:36,448 --> 01:06:37,602
(ringing continues)

1176
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:40,031
Jill, you gonna get that?

1177
01:06:44,104 --> 01:06:45,760
(beep)
Roberts' residence.

1178
01:06:45,953 --> 01:06:48,112
<i>(the voice) You're a survivor,
aren't you, Sidney?</i>

1179
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:51,335
<i>Your one and only skill.
You survive.</i>

1180
01:06:51,848 --> 01:06:53,496
<i>I have one question for you.</i>

1181
01:06:54,304 --> 01:06:56,726
<i>What good's it to be a survivor
in this little drama</i>

1182
01:06:56,728 --> 01:06:58,436
<i>if everyone close to you is dead?</i>

1183
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,027
- Who are you?
- Turn on the TV to channel 6.

1184
01:07:02,029 --> 01:07:03,414
Who the fuck are you?

1185
01:07:03,416 --> 01:07:05,406
<i>Turn it on.
Watch the teaser.</i>

1186
01:07:07,592 --> 01:07:10,843
(man on TV)
...nearly turned deadly tonight
with the latest victims of these attacks

1187
01:07:10,845 --> 01:07:14,583
being the wife of
the Woodsboro sheriff,
Gale Riley;

1188
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:18,930
AKA:  Gale Weathers who's in serious
condition tonight after being stabbed.

1189
01:07:18,932 --> 01:07:21,955
Her assailant then
disappeared in a sea of identic--

1190
01:07:21,957 --> 01:07:25,880
<i>(TV off)  (laughs)
Glad you came home, Sidney?
Has it been worth it yet?</i>

1191
01:07:25,882 --> 01:07:28,355
- Why are you doing this?
- Ah, friends count.

1192
01:07:28,357 --> 01:07:32,872
<i>But it's the family ties
that cut deep, am I right?</i>

1193
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,807
What do you mean?

1194
01:07:34,809 --> 01:07:36,918
<i>(chuckles)
The ones you care about most.</i>

1195
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:40,720
<i>And what's closer than family?
The bond of blood.</i>

1196
01:07:40,767 --> 01:07:46,427
- Don't.
- You can't save them.
All you can do is watch.  (laughs)

1197
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:47,950
Jill!

1198
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:56,740
(panting)

1199
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:07,620
Kate?

1200
01:08:07,622 --> 01:08:09,391
- Sid?
- Jill's not in her room.

1201
01:08:09,194 --> 01:08:10,918
- Oh, my God!
- She's gone to Kirby's.

1202
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,361
You gotta call her
and get her back here.
- Okay--

1203
01:08:13,726 --> 01:08:15,033
(beep)
(ringing)

1204
01:08:15,035 --> 01:08:16,039
Come on, Jill.

1205
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:17,190
<i>Leave a message.</i>

1206
01:08:17,192 --> 01:08:19,639
She's not picking up!
What's going on?

1207
01:08:19,812 --> 01:08:21,335
The killer called.
He's coming after me,

1208
01:08:21,745 --> 01:08:22,745
but he wants my family first.

1209
01:08:22,959 --> 01:08:24,738
- Oh, God, Jill!
- Let's get the cops.

1210
01:08:25,427 --> 01:08:26,429
- The cops aren't there.
- What?

1211
01:08:26,813 --> 01:08:28,690
They were there when I first came in,
but they're not there now.

1212
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:30,285
Let's get to Kirby's.

1213
01:08:34,429 --> 01:08:35,650
Out the front.

1214
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:40,751
(both gasp)

1215
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:41,964
Aaah!

1216
01:08:44,051 --> 01:08:46,437
Brace it from the bottom.
Can you?

1217
01:08:49,233 --> 01:08:50,443
(straining)

1218
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:51,510
(grunts)

1219
01:08:52,058 --> 01:08:53,418
(knob jiggling)
Let's get outta here.

1220
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:56,148
- (thud, grunts)
- (whispering) Kate, come on!

1221
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:12,673
Tell Jill... I'm so... sorry.

1222
01:09:13,151 --> 01:09:14,153
Shh!

1223
01:09:15,132 --> 01:09:16,577
(begins gasping)

1224
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:26,484
Kate?

1225
01:09:42,919 --> 01:09:44,767
Hicks?
What are you doing?

1226
01:09:44,769 --> 01:09:46,599
I just saw somebody coming around
the side of the house.

1227
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:48,878
Where are Hoss and Perkins?
I couldn't get them on the radio.

1228
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:51,721
Whose blood is that?

1229
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:54,735
It's--it's Kate's.
We were just attacked.

1230
01:09:54,947 --> 01:09:56,898
- She's dead.
- Where is she?

1231
01:09:57,407 --> 01:09:59,147
- Front door.
- Show me.

1232
01:09:59,149 --> 01:10:00,296
Okay.

1233
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,370
- Stay here.
- Okay.

1234
01:10:11,482 --> 01:10:13,180
(radio clicks)
This is Deputy Hicks.

1235
01:10:13,728 --> 01:10:15,729
I've got a homicide
at the Roberts residence.

1236
01:10:15,881 --> 01:10:17,449
No sign of Perkins or Hoss.

1237
01:10:17,899 --> 01:10:19,451
<i> (radio) Copy that, we'll try to locate them.</i>

1238
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:20,683
I'm so sorry--

1239
01:10:22,331 --> 01:10:23,652
(tires squealing)

1240
01:10:32,267 --> 01:10:34,863
You're gonna be fine.
All right?   I swear!

1241
01:10:35,654 --> 01:10:36,824
No more "on your own."

1242
01:10:37,444 --> 01:10:38,899
It's you and me, forever.

1243
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,732
One, two, three.
(grunts)

1244
01:10:41,504 --> 01:10:42,672
Easy!

1245
01:10:43,942 --> 01:10:45,495
- Dewey?
- Yeah?

1246
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:48,635
Promise me something.

1247
01:10:49,047 --> 01:10:50,473
Anything.

1248
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:53,139
(exhales)
Catch that motherfucker.

1249
01:10:54,544 --> 01:10:57,546
- Absolutely.  I love you.
-I love you.

1250
01:11:00,178 --> 01:11:02,737
You missed chaos.
Utter chaos.

1251
01:11:03,288 --> 01:11:05,590
- I can't believe that.
- The sheriff's wife, man!

1252
01:11:06,008 --> 01:11:07,710
She told us to cancel it,
and we didn't, and now this?

1253
01:11:08,028 --> 01:11:09,774
- What are we supposed to do?
- Robbie, calm down.

1254
01:11:09,776 --> 01:11:12,162
It makes sense.
This is what the re-boots do.

1255
01:11:12,164 --> 01:11:14,100
They--they one-up the
original ending.

1256
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:17,268
The Woodsboro
murders ended at a party.
So in the remake--

1257
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:20,097
The party's the false ending.
New rules.

1258
01:11:20,464 --> 01:11:21,789
Exactly.

1259
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,498
Okay, no offense, guys,
but I'm gonna put in "Stab 7."
-(Kirby)  Yes!

1260
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,743
- Nobody cancels my film festival.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1261
01:11:26,745 --> 01:11:29,432
I don't wanna watch that, not after
what happened to Olivia.

1262
01:11:29,983 --> 01:11:31,880
Oh, come on,
it was her favorite.

1263
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:35,080
Oh, wow, Kirby.
You got some classics here.

1264
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:37,249
- Yup.
- "Suspiria," "Don't Look Now."

1265
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:41,215
You know it.  I could
trivia your ass under the table,
'Cinema Boy.'

1266
01:11:41,535 --> 01:11:44,087
Oh, yeah?
Who played Leatherface first?

1267
01:11:44,835 --> 01:11:48,664
- Gunnar Hansen.
- Wow. Did you feel that?

1268
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,842
That charge that moved
between us just then?

1269
01:11:52,098 --> 01:11:54,782
Oh, that was me.
I have powers.

1270
01:11:55,275 --> 01:11:56,615
So sexy.

1271
01:11:57,596 --> 01:12:00,077
You guys are unbelievable.
You're playing fuckin' trivia games?

1272
01:12:00,262 --> 01:12:02,703
The cops are gonna come for us.
They're gonna shut down my website.

1273
01:12:02,863 --> 01:12:05,089
- We're so dead!
- Yeah. I agree.

1274
01:12:05,091 --> 01:12:07,409
- Jesus Christ, where'd you come from?
- The front door.

1275
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:10,253
By the way, Kirby, with everything
that's going on right now,

1276
01:12:10,255 --> 01:12:12,174
you probably shouldn't
leave that unlocked.

1277
01:12:13,784 --> 01:12:14,898
Sorry.

1278
01:12:15,281 --> 01:12:18,440
And, um, may I ask,
what the hell you're doing here?

1279
01:12:18,499 --> 01:12:20,744
What?
Didn't I find the after-party?

1280
01:12:21,551 --> 01:12:24,108
No, you found the anti-party,
and it's invitation only.

1281
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:27,575
Yeah, well, I got an invitation.
From Jill.

1282
01:12:29,843 --> 01:12:33,448
- So, what's the story?
- Eh, ah, w--what?

1283
01:12:34,253 --> 01:12:37,405
You sent me a text message.
"After-party at Kirby's house.

1284
01:12:38,674 --> 01:12:41,773
- I mean, it was from your phone.
- What do you mean from my phone?

1285
01:12:42,734 --> 01:12:45,871
W--where is my phone?
I think I left it in your car.

1286
01:12:45,873 --> 01:12:50,054
I didn't text him.
(sighs) I didn't text you.

1287
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:52,190
And I'll prove it.

1288
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,556
So, Charlie, Robbie,

1289
01:12:56,641 --> 01:12:58,687
how's it feel to be
accessories to a crime, huh?

1290
01:12:59,305 --> 01:13:01,385
I mean, really, Dewey's wife?

1291
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:03,030
My life is over.

1292
01:13:03,033 --> 01:13:05,526
So which one of
you guys sent me a text
message from Jill's phone, huh?

1293
01:13:05,691 --> 01:13:07,522
(snorts, coughs)

1294
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:11,227
We're supposed to accept
that you're telling the truth?

1295
01:13:12,216 --> 01:13:13,563
Isn't your phone missing?

1296
01:13:14,853 --> 01:13:16,624
- Got a new one.
- Really.

1297
01:13:17,218 --> 01:13:19,184
Oh, that's incredibly convenient.

1298
01:13:20,741 --> 01:13:22,708
- Dewey, it's Hicks.
- What's up?

1299
01:13:23,891 --> 01:13:25,410
- Kate Roberts is dead.
- Huh?

1300
01:13:25,446 --> 01:13:26,776
And Sidney fled the scene.

1301
01:13:27,689 --> 01:13:29,454
What?
What happened to Kate?

1302
01:13:29,944 --> 01:13:31,637
She was stabbed just like the others.

1303
01:13:31,841 --> 01:13:34,247
- What about Jill?
- No sign of her at all.

1304
01:13:34,881 --> 01:13:36,579
Where the hell
were Hoss and Perkins?

1305
01:13:37,231 --> 01:13:39,580
They were found dead
in their car two blocks away.

1306
01:13:40,228 --> 01:13:42,521
<i>(sighs) Multiple stab wounds</i>

1307
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:45,094
Okay.  (sighs)

1308
01:13:45,864 --> 01:13:46,983
I'm on my way.

1309
01:13:47,376 --> 01:13:48,376
Yes, sir.

1310
01:13:51,398 --> 01:13:53,778

1314
01:14:00,313 --> 01:14:03,616

- Yeah. We're gonna go scary.</i>

- Ugh, I saw that in theaters.</i>

It's not scary, it's gross,

All right.

1325
01:14:46,006 --> 01:14:49,262
Get ready for a "Hall Pass"
with Robbie Mercer extra.

1326
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:54,132
Now tonight, there is a good chance
that Charlie Walker,

1327
01:14:54,373 --> 01:14:58,608
yes, my Charlie Walker,
may get lucky with a girl.

1328
01:14:59,191 --> 01:15:03,701
Now I'm unable to, uh,
divulge my exact location, however,

1329
01:15:04,656 --> 01:15:10,728
suffice it to say, Woodsboro High
may be in store for some geek history.

1330
01:15:11,511 --> 01:15:12,739
We'll see.

- Yeah?

1345

I'm sorry, I know you're into
the movie and all,

1346
01:16:09,574 --> 01:16:13,621
but now would be a really good
time to  make a move.

01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:19,990
Ummm.

1349
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,581
Couldn't you make a move?

1350
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:24,690
I just did.

1351
01:16:26,002 --> 01:16:27,859
'Cause you're actually
pretty cute.

1352
01:16:28,953 --> 01:16:34,209
Especially when I'm scared
and... lonely...
and drunk.

1353
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:40,378
Hey, guys, did--did
you see Jill... come in?

1354
01:16:40,547 --> 01:16:41,778
I didn't see her outside.

1355
01:16:43,121 --> 01:16:45,251
Yes, Trevor, she is upstairs.

1356
01:16:45,579 --> 01:16:48,834
Thank God you're here to protect her
when you can't even find her.

1357
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:51,690
<i>(film)
There's nobody out here.</i>

1358
01:16:51,813 --> 01:16:54,137
(chuckles) Oh, dude,
I love this part of the movie.

1359
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:55,392
(sighs)

1360
01:16:55,412 --> 01:16:56,486
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1361
01:16:56,488 --> 01:17:00,512
Just when you think they're all safe
and comfortable in the house...

1362
01:17:01,227 --> 01:17:02,790
Ghostface comes in,
and, bam!

1363
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:08,948
Did I just interrupt
something right here?

1364
01:17:10,801 --> 01:17:14,196
Shut the fuck up.
(chuckles)

1365
01:17:14,198 --> 01:17:15,892
Who invited you, Trevor?

1366
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:19,018
(chuckling) All right.
Clearly not you.

1367
01:17:20,018 --> 01:17:22,659
Wow. I'm gonna be upstairs.
(exhales sharply)

1368
01:17:24,026 --> 01:17:25,771
Get out of my house!

1369
01:17:29,056 --> 01:17:30,210
Yeah, yeah.

1370
01:17:31,035 --> 01:17:34,985
Okay, I'm a little drunk, so don't
blame your internet connection. (chuckles)

1371
01:17:36,132 --> 01:17:38,561
Let's see what
Charlie's up to, shall we?

1372
01:17:39,013 --> 01:17:41,433
Or the saga of Trevor and Jill.

1373
01:17:41,902 --> 01:17:43,603
Oh, the intrigue
of Woodsboro High.

1374
01:17:43,605 --> 01:17:45,892
Who needs a killer around
when there's so much drama?

1375
01:17:59,373 --> 01:18:01,920
(chuckles) Oh, man.

1376
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:05,439
Yeah.

1377
01:18:05,861 --> 01:18:08,174
That's better.
(door opens, creaking)

1378
01:18:10,172 --> 01:18:11,300
(gasps) Aah!

1379
01:18:12,144 --> 01:18:13,790
Oh!

1380
01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:18,046
(slash)
Aah!   Aah-ha-ho!

1381
01:18:20,887 --> 01:18:23,791
Wait, no, you can't!
You can't! There's rules!

1382
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:25,679
I--I'm gay!   I'm gay!

1383
01:18:26,685 --> 01:18:28,430
I mean, if it helps.

1384
01:18:29,647 --> 01:18:31,450
(grunts)

1385
01:18:35,816 --> 01:18:36,816
<i>(film)...random girl who gets a call</i>

1386
01:18:36,818 --> 01:18:38,452
<i>that undoubtedly ends up
getting her killed.</i>

1387
01:18:38,454 --> 01:18:41,138
<i>It's all so predictable.
There's no element of surprise.</i>

1388
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:42,448
<i>You can see ev--  (Turns off)</i>

1389
01:18:43,266 --> 01:18:46,507
(odd faint 'sawing' sound)

1390
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:49,774
(dramatic music)

1391
01:18:57,211 --> 01:18:58,497
Kirby!

1392
01:18:58,652 --> 01:19:00,370
I found my phone.
It was up in your room.

1393
01:19:00,437 --> 01:19:02,369
There was no text
message sent to Trevor.

1394
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:06,285
He is such a liar.
Where is he?

1395
01:19:06,895 --> 01:19:09,396
What do you mean where is he?
He just went upstairs
looking for you.

1396
01:19:10,373 --> 01:19:11,739
He's not upstairs.

1397
01:19:13,557 --> 01:19:14,939
Trevor?

1398
01:19:17,309 --> 01:19:19,073
Charlie?   Robbie?

1399
01:19:20,513 --> 01:19:21,765
Maybe they're outside?

1400
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,567
- (screams)
- Jill.

1401
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:26,804
Sidney, I--I'm sorry,  I should've told
you and Mom where I was going.

1402
01:19:26,806 --> 01:19:28,974
No, it's okay. It's just, I-I
need you to come with me.
Come with me right now, okay?

1403
01:19:30,225 --> 01:19:31,225
(gasps)

1404
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,102
Run.

1405
01:19:33,104 --> 01:19:34,400
Robbie!

1406
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:36,881
(screaming)

1407
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,596
Go!

1408
01:19:39,435 --> 01:19:41,404
(all breathing heavily / gasping)

1409
01:19:41,408 --> 01:19:43,370
- Sidney!
- (grunts)

1410
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,100
Come on!

1411
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:51,650
- The balcony!
- There's no other way out?

1412
01:19:52,184 --> 01:19:54,391
We can jump.
(thudding, wood cracking)

1413
01:19:55,088 --> 01:19:57,155
It's two stories.
Where's your cell?

1414
01:19:57,157 --> 01:19:58,590
- Uh, here.
- Get under the bed!

1415
01:19:58,592 --> 01:19:59,968
- What?
- Just do what I say! Get under the bed.

1416
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:02,075
Don't make a sound and don't come out
until I come get you, okay?

1417
01:20:02,077 --> 01:20:03,473
- Just trust me.
- Okay.

1418
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,746
(crash)

1419
01:20:09,162 --> 01:20:11,633
(footsteps)

1420
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:15,278
You got it?  You're okay?
Jill, run!  Just keep running!
Get help!

1421
01:20:26,411 --> 01:20:28,788
(phone dialing)

1422
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:30,752
(telephone line ringing)

1423
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:32,890
(exhales)

1424
01:20:33,455 --> 01:20:36,043

(line ringing continues)

1425
01:20:39,431 --> 01:20:40,799
(grunts)
(panting)

1426
01:20:41,116 --> 01:20:42,854
(line ringing)
- (click) Hello?
- Dewey!

1427
01:20:42,856 --> 01:20:44,885
- Sidney, where are you?
- I'm at Kirby's.

1428
01:20:45,225 --> 01:20:46,805
The killer is here.
I need your help.

1429
01:20:46,807 --> 01:20:48,507
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.

1430
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:50,211
(grunts)

1431
01:20:51,547 --> 01:20:53,100
Sidney? Sidney!

1432
01:20:53,387 --> 01:20:55,822
I need all units to 329
Whispering Lane.

1433
01:20:56,090 --> 01:20:58,326
All units,
329 Whispering Lane!

1434
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:00,080

(sirens wailing)

1437
01:21:18,872 --> 01:21:20,072
(gasps)
Sorry. It's just me.

1438
01:21:20,074 --> 01:21:22,329
Look, I tried to call 911,
but the landline's dead

1439
01:21:22,331 --> 01:21:24,829
...and someone smashed the router
- I think I got through on my cell.

1440
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:27,316
Okay, where's Jill?
(footsteps overhead)

1441
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:29,051
We'll go and hide.
Go, go, go, go.

1442
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:33,320
(lock clicks)

1443
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,546
There's a room down here.
We can lock ourselves in.

1444
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,913
I heard you yelling to Jill.
Did she get away?

1445
01:21:38,424 --> 01:21:39,697
I think she's safe.

1446
01:21:43,672 --> 01:21:45,883
(lock clicks)

1447
01:21:47,248 --> 01:21:48,372
(thudding)
Kirby, let me in!

1448
01:21:49,139 --> 01:21:50,598
Charlie.

1449
01:21:52,492 --> 01:21:53,728
No.
No, no, no, no.

1450
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:56,064
I just found Robbie.
This--this is his blood.

1451
01:21:56,066 --> 01:21:58,727
Please. Please.
There is someone else out here.

1452
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:01,072
- Let me in!
- If you can't trust him,
don't open the door.

1453
01:22:03,292 --> 01:22:04,905
My God, let me in!

1454
01:22:04,907 --> 01:22:06,472
Get away from the door, Charlie.

1455
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,795
Kirby, it is me.
Please let me in!

1456
01:22:08,962 --> 01:22:10,564
Get away from the door, Charlie.

1457
01:22:10,566 --> 01:22:11,935
It's me!

1458
01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:15,994
(voice breaking)
I'm sorry,
I can't.

1459
01:22:16,256 --> 01:22:19,125
- What the fuck?!
- (whispers) I'm sorry.

1460
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:21,663
Behind you! Look out!

1461
01:22:22,316 --> 01:22:23,743

1462
01:22:24,141 --> 01:22:26,173

No!   No, no, no!

1463

(Kirby) : (sighs)
Oh, God, no, please.
(pounds on door)

1466
01:22:41,735 --> 01:22:43,384
Leave him alone!
(panting)

1467
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,188
Leave him alone!

1468
01:22:45,578 --> 01:22:47,016

1469
01:22:48,486 --> 01:22:50,932
It's Charlie's phone.

- Okay, okay. I'm gonna get Jill.

1475
01:23:03,665 --> 01:23:05,468
We should be in the same place.
Just--just keep him on the phone.

1476

I'll be right back, okay?

1477

You do know the genre.</i>

No, no, no.

01:25:00,755 --> 01:25:02,104
Great, Kirby.

1513
01:25:02,316 --> 01:25:03,807
(Kirby gasping)
I won.

1514
01:25:04,936 --> 01:25:06,935
(dogs barking)
Okay.  Almost there.

1515
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:09,496
Just hang tight.
Okay. Okay.

1516
01:25:10,414 --> 01:25:12,126
- All right.
- Kirby?

1517
01:25:12,128 --> 01:25:14,024
- Yeah?
- This is making a move.
- (gasps)

1518
01:25:16,037 --> 01:25:17,264
(gasps)

1519
01:25:17,266 --> 01:25:19,848
Four years of classes together,
and you notice me now?

1520
01:25:20,826 --> 01:25:23,312
- (Kirby gasping)
- Stupid bitch!  It's too late!

1521
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:25,121
(grunting)

1522
01:25:25,123 --> 01:25:26,357
Shh. Shh.

1523
01:25:26,359 --> 01:25:27,570
Oh, I know, I know.

1524
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:30,363
- (Kirby Gasps)
- It's okay.  Take your time

1525
01:25:30,365 --> 01:25:32,798
Doesn't happen as fast
as it does in the movies, I know.
- (she gasps)

1526
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:38,312
- Ch-- (gasps)  Char-- (gasps)
- Just a second!

1527
01:25:41,044 --> 01:25:42,640
(grunting)
(gurgling of blood)

1528
01:25:54,770 --> 01:25:58,052
(door opening and squeaking)

1529
01:25:59,054 --> 01:26:02,036
(gasps, breathes heavily)
(footsteps downstairs)

1530
01:26:02,041 --> 01:26:03,814
Kirby?
(door opening)

1531
01:26:04,787 --> 01:26:05,788
(she grunts)

1532
01:26:06,307 --> 01:26:07,800
(gasping)

1533
01:26:08,032 --> 01:26:10,440
You know, you learn a lot when
you watch movies over and over.

1534
01:26:10,881 --> 01:26:12,695
All the plots are about
trying to kill YOU.

1535
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:15,582
(gasping)  Where's Jill?

1536
01:26:15,584 --> 01:26:17,193
Oh, you think
she's gonna get away?

1537
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:19,038
You think anyone gets away?

1538
01:26:19,876 --> 01:26:20,978
(both grunt)

1539
01:26:21,937 --> 01:26:23,241
(she grunts then gasps)

1540
01:26:29,729 --> 01:26:32,262
- Jill?
- Hello, Sidney.

1541
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:34,068
Surprised?

1542
01:26:34,681 --> 01:26:36,073
Watch this.

1543
01:26:34,075 --> 01:26:37,883
This is the part, my dear cousin,

1544
01:26:37,885 --> 01:26:39,336
when the cameras...

1545
01:26:40,848 --> 01:26:42,720
...turn off.
- (Sidney gasps)
(beep)

1546
01:26:43,189 --> 01:26:44,189
(Sidney gasps)

1547
01:26:46,048 --> 01:26:47,148
Charlie?

1548
01:26:47,427 --> 01:26:48,645
Already taken care of.

1549
01:26:49,226 --> 01:26:51,612
Man, I got great footage
of my Robbie kill.

1550
01:26:51,959 --> 01:26:53,896
Better than Jenny
and Marnie or Olivia even.

1551
01:26:54,343 --> 01:26:57,083
Good, we'll cut and upload it later
and make it all traceable to Trevor.

1552
01:26:57,085 --> 01:26:58,460
Speaking of which...

1553
01:27:02,268 --> 01:27:04,744
- Remind you of anything?
- Jill, please--

1554
01:27:04,746 --> 01:27:05,745
Shut up!   Dick--

1555
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:08,065
Everything I learned,
I learned from you.

1556
01:27:08,648 --> 01:27:10,719
You think you had
a shitty boyfriend, Sidney?

1557
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:12,393
Here's one that fucks you,

1558
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:13,732
dumps you,

1559
01:27:14,223 --> 01:27:15,950
and doesn't even make you famous.

1560
01:27:16,589 --> 01:27:19,708
Dagh! What the fuck, Jill?
I loved you!

1561
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:21,727
Shut the fuck up already!

1562
01:27:22,068 --> 01:27:24,608
Agh!     Aagh!

1563
01:27:24,754 --> 01:27:26,529
I'm sure those cops
would want you to have this, Jill.

1564
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:28,000
For your protection.

1565
01:27:28,684 --> 01:27:29,684
(gasps) No--

1566
01:27:31,102 --> 01:27:32,607
Nn-nnh!

1567
01:27:33,098 --> 01:27:34,887
(sobbing)
Baby, please--

1568
01:27:34,889 --> 01:27:36,619
Shouldn't have killed
all these people, Trev.

1569
01:27:37,147 --> 01:27:38,734
Gone and put it on video even.

1570
01:27:39,556 --> 01:27:41,358
But it means a lot that
you did it for me.

1571
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:43,463
What the fuck are you
talking about?

1572
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:46,781
I am not...  the girl...  you cheat on.

1573
01:27:47,592 --> 01:27:49,644
(gunshot)
Aagh! Aaaagh! ahah.

1574
01:27:49,701 --> 01:27:51,478
(screams)
(cries)

1575
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:54,337
I've gone through everything.
We're definitely good on timeline.

1576
01:27:55,127 --> 01:27:57,050
Oh, yeah.
We're perfect.

1577
01:27:57,052 --> 01:27:58,762
No, no, no, please!

1578
01:27:58,764 --> 01:27:59,963
(gunshot)
(splatter sound)

1579
01:28:02,998 --> 01:28:04,008
(exhales)

1580
01:28:06,418 --> 01:28:07,938
Ready for act three?

1581
01:28:09,010 --> 01:28:10,559
Got it figured out yet, Sidney?

1582
01:28:10,967 --> 01:28:11,967
In keeping with our remake theme,

1583
01:28:12,882 --> 01:28:14,768
Trevor's this generation's
Billy Loomis,

1584
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:18,341
and we're the innocent victims,
Sidney and Randy.

1585
01:28:18,523 --> 01:28:22,150
See, with you, the world
just heard about what happened.

1586
01:28:22,152 --> 01:28:24,814
But with us, they're gonna see it.
(screaming on video)

1587
01:28:24,816 --> 01:28:26,912
It's gonna be a worldwide sensation.

1588
01:28:26,913 --> 01:28:29,008
I mean, people gotta see this shit.

1589
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:30,995
It's not like
anyone reads anymore.

1590
01:28:30,997 --> 01:28:32,979
(screaming on video)

1591
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:35,087
We're gonna know fame

1592
01:28:35,385 --> 01:28:38,274
like you never
even dreamed of.

1593
01:28:39,205 --> 01:28:40,626
Last two teenagers standing.

1594
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:43,593
This time Randy gets the girl.

1595
01:28:49,505 --> 01:28:52,183
You were amazing.
You're the perfect victim.

1596
01:28:53,044 --> 01:28:56,153
I was so believable
today, wasn't I?

1597
01:28:56,155 --> 01:29:00,000
I mean, I told so many lies that
I actually started to believe them.

1598
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,919
I really think that
I was born for this.

1599
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,355
How could you do this?

1600
01:29:07,011 --> 01:29:09,653
Do you know what it was like
growing up in this family?

1601
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:11,979
Related to you?

1602
01:29:12,249 --> 01:29:15,036
I mean, all I ever heard
was Sidney this

1603
01:29:15,038 --> 01:29:17,935
and Sidney that
and Sidney, Sidney, Sidney.

1604
01:29:18,703 --> 01:29:20,926
You were always
just so fucking special!

1605
01:29:22,449 --> 01:29:23,579
Well, now I'm
the special one.

1606
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:26,137
You'll slip.
They always do.

1607
01:29:26,585 --> 01:29:28,899
Hm!   Come on, Charlie,
let's get on with this.

1608
01:29:31,334 --> 01:29:34,086
You have to be strong

1609
01:29:34,088 --> 01:29:36,004
and hold still, okay?

1610
01:29:36,317 --> 01:29:38,875
Yeah.  Yeah, old school,
like Billy and Stu.

1611
01:29:39,935 --> 01:29:41,192
Come on, baby, get it up!

1612
01:29:41,952 --> 01:29:45,441
Come on. Shoulder me!
Shoulder me! Shoulder me!

1613
01:29:45,443 --> 01:29:47,021
Get it up!   (grunts)
(Sidney gasps)

1614
01:29:48,391 --> 01:29:49,624
What?
(gasps)

1615
01:29:50,685 --> 01:29:54,194
The heart... that's not the
way we rehearsed it.

1616
01:29:54,194 --> 01:29:57,682
You said it, Charlie:
Billy and Stu, Trevor and you.

1617
01:29:58,895 --> 01:30:00,511
What the media really loves, baby,
(Charlie gasping)

1618
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,307
is a SOLE survivor.
(Charlie gasping)

1619
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:06,104
Just ask you-know-who.
(Charlie gasping)

1620
01:30:06,106 --> 01:30:07,640
Trevor was your partner,

1621
01:30:08,299 --> 01:30:10,720
but you,
you were the idea man.

1622
01:30:10,854 --> 01:30:12,742
(Jill grunts)
(Charlie gasps)
(Sid gasps)

1623
01:30:13,638 --> 01:30:15,645
(Charlie continues gasping)

1624
01:30:19,946 --> 01:30:22,476
(inhales)
Even your friends.
(exhales)

1625
01:30:23,528 --> 01:30:24,923
My friends?

1626
01:30:25,374 --> 01:30:27,354
What world are you living in?

1627
01:30:27,356 --> 01:30:28,737
I don't need friends.

1628
01:30:29,429 --> 01:30:30,933
I need fans.

1629
01:30:31,668 --> 01:30:33,039
Don't you get it?

1630
01:30:33,487 --> 01:30:36,345
This has never been
about killing you.

1631
01:30:36,953 --> 01:30:39,377
It's about...  becoming you.

1632
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:42,241
I mean, for fuck's sake,
my own mother had to die...

1633
01:30:42,243 --> 01:30:45,696
no great loss there,
so I could stay TRUE to the original.

1634
01:30:46,487 --> 01:30:47,731
That's sick, right?

1635
01:30:48,417 --> 01:30:51,220
Well, sick is the new sane.

1636
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:53,544
You had your fifteen minutes.

1637
01:30:53,546 --> 01:30:55,176
Now I want mine!

1638
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,295
I mean, what am I
supposed to do?

1639
01:30:57,459 --> 01:31:01,373
Go to college?
Grad school?   Work?

1640
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:02,808
Look around.

1641
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,012
We all live in public now,
we're all on the Internet.

1642
01:31:05,658 --> 01:31:07,898
How do you think people
become famous anymore?

1643
01:31:08,739 --> 01:31:11,519
You don't have to achieve anything.

1644
01:31:12,775 --> 01:31:15,672
You just gotta have
fucked-up shit happen to you.

1645
01:31:16,693 --> 01:31:18,743
So, you do have to die, Sid.

1646
01:31:19,235 --> 01:31:23,061
Those are the rules.
New movie, new franchise.

1647
01:31:23,456 --> 01:31:25,822
There's only room for one lead,
and let's face it,

1648
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:28,704
your ingénue days,
they're over.

1649
01:31:28,706 --> 01:31:30,239
(Jill snorts)
(Sidney gasps)

1650
01:31:33,628 --> 01:31:35,403
(orgasmic gasp / sigh)

1651
01:31:35,405 --> 01:31:37,562
Don't tell me you didn't know
this day would come.

1652
01:31:37,564 --> 01:31:39,374
(Sidney gasps)

1653
01:31:41,915 --> 01:31:43,131
(sighs)

1654
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:47,290
(thud)

1655
01:31:48,725 --> 01:31:52,396
(forced rapid breathing)

1656
01:31:56,415 --> 01:31:57,786
(slash)
(grunts)

1657
01:32:00,968 --> 01:32:02,333
(slash)
(grunts)

1658
01:32:17,793 --> 01:32:19,004
(ripping)

1659
01:32:19,729 --> 01:32:20,880
Aah!

1660
01:32:23,425 --> 01:32:24,548
(grunts)

1661
01:32:28,734 --> 01:32:29,859
(grunts)

1662
01:32:34,123 --> 01:32:36,060
(ripping)
OW!

1663
01:32:37,217 --> 01:32:39,031
(cry of pain)

1664
01:32:48,983 --> 01:32:50,284
(inhales)

1665
01:32:51,773 --> 01:32:53,659
(breathing hard)

1666
01:32:54,634 --> 01:32:56,011
(slice)
(Jill screams)

1667
01:32:56,568 --> 01:32:57,873
(slash)
(gasps)

1668
01:32:57,875 --> 01:32:59,495
Oh, fuck!

1669
01:33:10,559 --> 01:33:12,640
(panting)

1670
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:16,568
(glass breaking)
(grunts)

1671
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:18,505
(grunts)

1672
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,443
(grunting)

1673
01:33:22,748 --> 01:33:23,961
Eeeh!
(exhales)

1674
01:33:26,039 --> 01:33:28,066
(panting)

1675
01:33:30,018 --> 01:33:31,452
(grunts)

1676
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:34,327
(panting)

1677
01:33:41,712 --> 01:33:43,549
(grunts)
(breaking glass)

1678
01:33:45,932 --> 01:33:47,167
(groans)

1679
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:51,103
(sighs)

1680
01:33:56,246 --> 01:33:59,561
(sirens approaching)

1681
01:34:00,291 --> 01:34:01,515
(grunts)

1682
01:34:06,414 --> 01:34:07,414
(multiple sirens very close)

1683
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,779
Come on, let's move it!

1684
01:34:30,101 --> 01:34:32,140
(siren winds down to silence)

1685
01:34:32,148 --> 01:34:33,873
Check the rooms,
both sides and upstairs.

1686
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:49,269
(mixture of sirens, police radios, chatter)

1687
01:34:52,305 --> 01:34:54,427
(cameras clicking)
Jill, can you give us a description
of the murderer?

1688
01:34:54,429 --> 01:34:56,790
(multiple reporters shouting questions)

1689
01:35:08,749 --> 01:35:10,766
<i>(woman) Jill, how does it feel to be a hero?</i>

1690
01:35:20,905 --> 01:35:22,425
(gasps)

1691
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:26,060
Jill, you made it,
that's all that matters.

1692
01:35:27,014 --> 01:35:28,938
Trevor, Charlie,
they tried to kill me.

1693
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:31,303
And I heard they killed my mom.

1694
01:35:32,042 --> 01:35:34,025
And Robbie and Kirby, too.

1695
01:35:34,314 --> 01:35:36,493
Shh. Just lay back.

1696
01:35:36,875 --> 01:35:37,874
Try to rest.

1697
01:35:37,929 --> 01:35:41,582
(exhales)
Is... is your wife...

1698
01:35:41,585 --> 01:35:42,968
(chuckles softly)

1699
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:45,690
She's gonna be fine.
She's recovering.

1700
01:35:47,517 --> 01:35:51,154
If I ever write a book one day,
I'd--I'd want her to write it with me.

1701
01:35:52,084 --> 01:35:55,703
We'd be a good team
with our matching wounds and all.

1702
01:35:58,948 --> 01:36:00,393
We're survivors now.

1703
01:36:01,263 --> 01:36:03,837
(voice breaking)
I just wish Sidney was, too.

1704
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:05,942
Jill...

1705
01:36:06,735 --> 01:36:08,377
they're not sure yet.

1706
01:36:09,089 --> 01:36:10,496
It's still touch and go.

1707
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:12,929
But she's in ICU.

1708
01:36:13,497 --> 01:36:16,040
And they think Sidney
just might make it.

1709
01:36:17,620 --> 01:36:19,101
What?

1710
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:21,499
But--but I saw Trevor kill her.

1711
01:36:21,713 --> 01:36:24,189
Look, we don't know yet.

1712
01:36:24,718 --> 01:36:26,071
But she's hanging on.

1713
01:36:29,593 --> 01:36:31,002
I--I--I wanna see her.

1714
01:36:31,931 --> 01:36:33,395
She's not awake yet.

1715
01:36:34,284 --> 01:36:37,103
And she may not
remember anything.

1716
01:36:37,183 --> 01:36:38,530
You'll to help her with that.

1717
01:36:39,790 --> 01:36:42,890
It's all in time.
Just get some rest now, okay?

1718
01:36:48,459 --> 01:36:52,284
(regular beep of infusion pump)

1719
01:36:57,456 --> 01:36:59,199
(infusion pump alarm)

1720
01:37:14,539 --> 01:37:17,041
(musical tension building)

1721
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:33,534
She gonna be okay?

1722
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:37,244
Yeah.
She's a strong kid.

1723
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:38,988
She's gonna have to be.

1724
01:37:40,775 --> 01:37:42,860
(chuckles)
She asked if you were okay.

1725
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:45,912
She thinks you guys
should write a book together...

1726
01:37:46,105 --> 01:37:48,141
...with your matching wounds
(chuckles)

1727
01:37:48,143 --> 01:37:49,817
Why?
She was stabbed in the shoulder?

1728
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:55,602
How did she know I was, too?

1729
01:38:01,325 --> 01:38:02,739
Shit!

1730
01:38:03,223 --> 01:38:05,182
(breathes deeply)

1731
01:38:08,651 --> 01:38:10,980
You just won't die, will you?

1732
01:38:11,985 --> 01:38:13,342
- (gasps)
- Who are you?

1733
01:38:13,345 --> 01:38:15,230
Michael fucking Myers?

1734
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,240
Yeah, I don't think so.

1735
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:20,991

01:38:34,317 --> 01:38:35,317
Augh!

1743

1744

How are those stitches?

1749
01:38:50,614 --> 01:38:51,894
(hoarse scream)

<i>(Dewey yelling in distance):

Hicks, get up to
Sidney Prescott's room

Be right up, sir!</i>

- Sid--
- Dewey!

(breathing heavily)
Is this how it's gonna be, Sid?

1761
01:39:37,443 --> 01:39:39,364
The ending of the movie
was supposed to be
at the house.

1762
01:39:39,366 --> 01:39:41,933
I mean, this is just... silly!
(chuckles)

1763
01:39:42,359 --> 01:39:44,168
(gasps)
Consider this
an alternate ending.

1764
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:47,732
You're never gonna get
out of this, Jill.

1765
01:39:47,790 --> 01:39:49,269
- Of course I will.
-(Gale) Dewey!

1766

(gasps) Sid?

1767
01:39:52,706 --> 01:39:55,551
Easy.
Okay, wait.

1768
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,201
What about the book?

1769
01:39:57,420 --> 01:39:59,552
Looks like I'll just
have to write it myself.

1770
01:39:59,639 --> 01:40:00,887
Eee-yah!

1771

- God damn it!
- Ohhh!

1773
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:08,105
Don't even think about shooting,
or I'll blow Dewey's head off.

1774

(gasps)

1775
01:40:09,267 --> 01:40:10,771
What you think I won't do it?

1776
01:40:11,454 --> 01:40:13,889
Gimme your gun!
- (Gale whispers) Do it!

1777
01:40:23,402 --> 01:40:25,173
You just had to be the hero, huh?

1778
01:40:26,415 --> 01:40:27,884
(safety clicks)
Give me... your gun!

1779
01:40:30,568 --> 01:40:32,027
What are you, deaf?

1780
01:40:32,707 --> 01:40:34,860
Give me your gun!

(scrapes along floor)

1783
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:44,034
And get up.

1784
01:40:46,186 --> 01:40:47,650
And keep your hands
over your head.

1785
01:40:48,047 --> 01:40:49,696
Don't do anything stu--
(gunshot)
(grunts)

1786

Don't fucking tell me
what to do.

1787
01:40:53,886 --> 01:40:55,232
(softly) Oh, God.

1788
01:40:55,675 --> 01:40:57,495
Now get up, bitch.

1789
01:40:57,875 --> 01:40:58,875
Okay.

1790
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:01,033
Get up!

1791
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:03,349
- Now!
- Okay.

1792
01:41:06,188 --> 01:41:07,188

1793
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:08,927

Okay.

1798
01:41:21,029 --> 01:41:24,252

I'm gonna enjoy blowing
your head off.

1799
01:41:25,409 --> 01:41:28,201
(machine still charging)
Okay, but can I just...

1800
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,388
...have one final word?

1801
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:33,543
What?
"Please"?

1802
01:41:36,164 --> 01:41:37,330
No.

1803
01:41:40,052 --> 01:41:42,006
- Clear.
- "Clear"?

1804
01:41:42,265 --> 01:41:43,462
Clear.     (zap)

1806
01:41:48,925 --> 01:41:50,744
You forgot the
first rule of remakes, Jill.

Don't fuck with the original.

1811
01:42:01,606 --> 01:42:04,356
Don't ask. (groans)

1812
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:06,680
You okay?

1813
01:42:09,633 --> 01:42:11,571

Several injuries.
