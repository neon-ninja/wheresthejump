00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,077
Mia?

3
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,163
Aiden?

4
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,502
Mia?

5
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,347
We have to go.

6
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,941
Mia?

7
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,116
Mia, let's go.

8
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,538
Aiden?

9
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,336
Aiden!
Come on.

10
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,381
- Just shake her hand.
- How did you get an outfit

11
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,216
- just like Mom?
- Shake it.

12
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,343
Shake her hand.

13
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,599
You're lucky
that can go right back in.

14
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,267
Let me see if her head
can go right back in.

15
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,644
N-N-N-No, no, no.

16
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,978
Not the head.

17
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,747
Is she gonna be there?

18
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,499
No.

19
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,169
She's such a retard.

20
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,860
Come on.

21
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,907
- Hey.
- Dad.

22
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,993
Where have you been?
Did you get lost?

23
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,288
I miss you.

24
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,081
Mwah.

25
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,500
Come on.
You, too, mister.

26
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,043
Hey, listen, can you guys, uh,

27
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,795
go to the store
and get some candy?

28
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,589
'Cause Mom and I need
to have a little talk, okay?

29
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,840
Thanks.

30
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,216
What-What's happening?

31
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,803
- Candy.
- And?

32
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,640
No artificial colors, gelatins,
or artificial sweeteners.

33
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,060
Don't be long.

34
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,687
Need a hand?

35
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,397
Okay.

36
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,567
You have a good drive over?

37
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,116
Thanks for bringing 'em over.

38
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,370
- She's not here.
- Uh...

39
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,663
You look nice.

40
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,378
Tea? Coffee?

41
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,381
Okay, I'll have coffee.

42
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,300
Um...
Well, we got instant.

43
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,302
Sorry, 'cause I gave it up.

44
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,512
Is that okay?

45
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,864
You wanted to talk.

46
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,034
Um, listen, um...

47
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:30,080
I think we should finalize
the divorce.

48
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,464
Laura, we can't stay
where we are.

49
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,341
We have to...

50
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,593
um...

51
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,136
Okay.

52
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,891
Grace and I
are gonna get married.

53
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,852
September.

54
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,568
Okay.

55
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,821
Laura.

56
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,117
Laura?

57
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,346
There is going
to be more humidity around,

58
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,640
and that's going to make it feel
a little bit hotter

59
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,434
and make it harder
to cool off for your body.

60
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,311
So we do have
this heat advisory up

61
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,062
for a lot
of easternmost Massachusetts,

62
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,856
away from
the immediate coastline.

63
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,441
And this is
in effect till about...

64
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,236
That sticky air is courtesy

65
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,071
of the southwesterly
wind flow here,

66
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,032
and you can see
the dew point temperatures

67
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,867
are running in the low 70s.

68
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,453
That's oppressive humidity
down toward D.C.,

69
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,996
and some of that
has climbed all the way up

70
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,456
near the Canadian border.

71
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,874
But as you go to the northwest,

72
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,375
back towards the Great Lakes,

73
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,960
see how these dew points drop

74
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,629
into that refreshing category?

75
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,380
That's going
to get here for tomorrow.

76
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,383
But first we'll have a frontal
boundary across the area,

77
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,052
and this front is gonna be
a trigger,

78
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,679
as we get into the afternoon,
for a few thunderstorms.

79
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,641
Now, the storm prediction center
is eyeing that area

80
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,226
for the potential
that a few of these storms,

81
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,605
uh, a marginal risk...

82
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,857
...and the primary concern
would be for some

83
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,692
potentially damaging winds.

84
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,904
Also, with so much moisture...
heavy rain,

85
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,906
and there should be...

86
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,783
...that develop
this afternoon as well.

87
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,369
So, take a look at the timeline
here on Futurecast...

88
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,872
...clouds are going
to start to build,

89
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,416
especially along...

90
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,210
As we get deeper
into the afternoon, though,

91
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,337
that's when the storm starts
to get going.

92
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,589
2:00 to 4:00 p.m.,
you can see a few...

93
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,204
I don't know much.

94
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,956
What I do know is this:

95
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,500
she was a good woman.

96
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,127
A very good woman.

97
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,423
And she was always there
for her family.

98
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,633
Do not forget,

99
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,886
birth and death are two doors

100
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,723
through which
we must all journey.

101
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,516
All of us.

102
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,643
Death, however,

103
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,480
is but a new beginning,
a new start.

104
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,317
Therefore,
let us all pray for her soul.

105
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,697
Pray that she crosses over
to where she needs to go.

she can't go to Heaven.

115
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,382
She can't go to Heaven.

116
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,009
She's not gonna...

117
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,804
she's not gonna go
to Heaven, Daddy.

118
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,598
She's not gonna go to Heaven.

119
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,934
You don't understand.

120
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,228
She can't. She...

121
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,777
Baby, listen to me.

122
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,779
Listen to me.

123
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,783
Nobody knows where we go.

124
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,286
Mama wouldn't want you to cry.

125
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,996
She wouldn't want you to worry.

126
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,706
- You don't understand.
- Baby.

127
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,417
- Go away!
- Okay.

128
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,419
Go away.
Leave me alone.

129
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,047
Go away.

130
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,757
Go away.

131
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,612
Is it okay?
Did you plug it in?

132
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,616
Hey, hang on a second.

133
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,160
Mia, can you come here a minute?

134
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,500
Okay, so...

135
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,585
Grace is gonna be here
in a second.

136
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,213
And I just wanted to talk
to you guys about something.

137
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,591
How would you feel about going

138
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,094
to the mountains again
for Christmas?

139
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,722
I thought you were working.

140
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,432
Yeah, I am, but, uh,

141
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,017
I'll drive you guys up
after school's out,

142
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,812
and then come back on the 25th.

143
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,690
Are we gonna be there alone?

144
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,609
No, I thought it'd be nice
to ask Grace to come with us,

145
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,528
and, you know,
you can have some fun,

146
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,571
get to know her a little better.

147
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,617
No.

148
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,244
No, you don't want to do that?

149
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,913
- No.
- How come?

150
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,751
I'm not going
anywhere with her, and...

151
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,337
least of all on Christmas.

152
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,673
- Why not?
- Are you crazy?

153
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,383
No, Aiden, I'm not crazy.

154
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,760
Grace is part of my life,
she's part of your life.

155
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,095
- What?
- And I think it's about time

156
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,888
you guys got to know her.

157
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,807
What do you mean?

158
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,268
Okay, look.
I'm gonna marry Grace.

159
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:38,276
We... we wanted
to tell you tonight.

160
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,861
It's all her fault.

161
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,696
I'm sorry?

162
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,448
I said it's all her fault.

163
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,574
What's her fault?

164
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,867
What do you mean,
what's her fault?

165
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,952
What do you mean?

166
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,246
You're talking about Mom?

167
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,585
You left Mom
for, for a psychopath.

168
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,504
Who told you
she was a psychopath?

169
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,423
Hmm?

170
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,717
She's in your books, right?

171
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,183
Fuck you.

172
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,267
Aiden.

173
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,526
I'm really sorry,

174
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,821
but we just can't do this
right now.

175
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,308
I'm gonna have
to go out again later, okay?

176
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,524
- What?
- I was right.

177
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,276
Grace is from his book on cults.

178
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,862
Oh, my God.

179
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:50,366
"Radical Christian sect."

180
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,994
Everyone committed suicide
except for her.

181
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,413
She's supposed to bring

182
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,749
the teachings of the sect
to the public.

183
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,750
Click there.

184
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,340
And you will find salvation.

185
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:10,553
Repent and you will wash away
every sin

186
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,555
that has been bothering you.

187
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,183
Just confess.

188
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,269
Repent and pray.

189
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:22,106
Now, don't think
I'm the only one watching.

190
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,609
God is waiting.

191
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,489
He's so impatient, and He can't
wait to see your smiling faces.

192
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,909
Please join with me.

193
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,163
Would you like to sing now?

194
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:41,000
♪ Nearer, my God ♪

195
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,085
♪ To Thee ♪

196
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,214
♪ Nearer to... ♪

197
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,559
Is that real?

198
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,414
What are you doing in here?

199
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,082
Um, I was just...

200
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,500
What's going on?

201
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,669
...looking something up
for Mia's school project,

202
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,254
because my...

203
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,381
computer is updating.

204
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,803
Okay.

205
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,100
Look, I was...
I was just with Grace.

206
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:24,604
She really wants to come on this
trip and get to know you guys.

207
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,774
It's important to me
that we give her a chance.

208
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,651
Okay?

209
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,654
Come on, she's got
all this fun stuff planned.

210
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,573
Stay up all night, watch movies.

211
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,492
She's a terrible cook,
so you can eat what you want.

212
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,495
You give it a chance?

213
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,166
Hmm? Think about it?

214
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,542
For me?

215
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,141
There she is.

216
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,418
It's the paper.
I've got to take this.

217
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,253
I'm sorry.

218
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,172
Yeah. What?

219
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,550
Well, I asked you
to e-mail it to me.

220
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,801
Well...

221
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,928
can you do that?

222
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,223
Hi, Aiden.

223
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,517
Hi, Mia.

224
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,739
Ready to go?

225
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,060
Oh.

226
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,274
Do you have the key?

227
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,109
I got the key.

228
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,444
Go pee, Grady.

229
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,945
Go pee.

230
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,858
I set up
a little dog bed in the hall.

231
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,276
A what?

232
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,362
Dog bed.

233
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,947
Is that okay?

234
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,074
Okay.

235
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,492
The bedrooms are upstairs.

236
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,160
It's the last door on the right.

237
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,161
Need a hand?

238
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,579
No, I'm okay.

239
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,164
There's your dog bed, Grady.

240
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,585
Good boy.

241
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,671
Look at your little skunk.

242
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,256
You guys want a cookie before
I finish this whole packet?

243
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,257
Yeah.

244
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,676
Take one for your brother.

245
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,011
- I have three.
- Okay.

246
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,211
Okay.

247
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,714
Here you go.

248
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,299
Who's hungry?

249
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,967
Dig in.

250
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,595
Bless us, 0 Lord, and these,

251
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,680
Thy gifts,
which we are about to receive.

252
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,016
- Amen.
- Amen.

253
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,780
What are you looking at?

254
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,159
That's Laura's.

255
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,830
Does it bother you?

256
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,791
I'll take 'em down.

257
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,334
It doesn't bother me.

258
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,254
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

259
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,819
Hmm?

260
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,530
Shh, shh, shh.

261
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,449
Shh.

262
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,704
Stop.

263
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,082
You're gonna make yourself bleed.

264
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:49,793
- I'm sorry.
- You'll make your nose bleed.

265
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,129
- No, I'm okay.
- Okay.

266
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,881
- You good?
- Yeah.

267
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,549
Okay.

268
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,908
I'll see you later.
See you later.

269
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,710
Stay, Grady. Stay.

270
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,092
Aiden.

271
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,471
Oh.

272
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,223
No!

273
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,183
Get you!

274
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,269
No! Aah!

275
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,688
How's it going?

276
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,023
Good.

277
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,110
- Do you need a hand?
- Yeah.

278
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,029
Hey, kids, give Grace a hand.

279
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,450
Go, go, go!

280
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,419
That's our mom's hat.

281
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,755
Oh.

282
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,383
I'm sorry, I...

283
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,386
I didn't know.

284
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,685
What happened?

285
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,772
I didn't know
it was their mom's hat.

286
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,774
It's okay.

287
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,860
Here. Take mine.

288
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,990
Come on.

289
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,992
Pull you?

290
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,411
Yeah.

291
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,871
That's way better.

292
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,748
This is the way to do it.

293
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,919
Mia?

294
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,214
You okay?

295
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,592
And...

296
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,676
GRACE.
Mia?

297
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,637
Mia?

298
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,349
Be careful.

299
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,017
There's a fishing hole.

300
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,771
Stop! Stop!

301
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,148
Stop! Stop, stop.

302
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,776
Move back.
You have to be careful.

303
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,695
Stay here. I'll get it.

304
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,364
Let me...

305
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,327
- Dad!
- What?

306
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,037
Dad!

307
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,455
Mia, get back!

308
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,752
Come here. Give me your hand.

309
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,462
Give me your hand. I got you.

310
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,755
I got you.

311
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,799
My doll!

312
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,845
I got you. Come on. You're okay.

313
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,680
You're okay. You're okay.

314
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,349
Get b... get back in the house.

315
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,767
You're okay.

316
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,772
You're okay.

317
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,241
Please.

318
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,500
Don't worry,
you'll be warm soon.

319
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,552
Here. It's really hot.

320
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,222
You feeling okay?

321
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,018
I'll make you something to eat.

322
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,153
Hmm.

323
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,656
Hey, it's me.

324
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,909
Uh, listen,
I can't come back tonight.

325
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,662
Well, uh, can you get someone
to cover for me?

326
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,373
It's kind of an emergency.

327
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,250
Mm-hmm.

328
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,144
You okay?

329
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,854
Mm-hmm.

330
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,319
I don't think
I should go to the city.

331
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,945
Why?

332
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,781
'Cause I don't want
to leave you here with the kids

333
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,159
if you're not feeling...

334
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:16,286
- up to it.
- Uh, I'm feeling fine.

335
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,455
It was my idea,
and it's a couple days.

336
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,457
I can do a couple days.

337
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,959
- You sure?
- Yeah.

338
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,836
As long as I don't have
to go ice-skating.

339
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,137
Okay.

340
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,684
You know what, come here.

341
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:48,026
One, two, three, four, five.

342
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,490
This is a family heirloom.

343
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,992
Belonged to Laura's dad.

344
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,495
You ever use one?

345
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,582
Stand like this at arm's length,

346
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,377
or you can use both hands.
It's up to you.

347
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:09,839
You cock the gun by pulling
the hammer all the way back.

348
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,425
Want to try?

349
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,885
Come on, have a go.

350
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,346
It's pretty easy.

351
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,598
Okay, here, hold this.

352
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,851
It's got quite a recoil,
so put your weight in...

353
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,944
Wow.

354
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,946
Wow.

355
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,532
Not bad.

356
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,245
Now I can drive.

357
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,416
Give me a kiss. I'm only gonna
be gone a couple of days.

358
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,084
Maybe I'll hitch a ride back
with Santa Claus.

359
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,086
What do you think? Hmm?

360
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,297
Okay, guys, I'm off.

361
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,091
Wendy from the gas station
has a key if anything happens.

362
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,010
The kids have their number.
Remember what I told you.

363
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,469
Be nice.

364
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,763
Don't go hunting
for your Christmas presents.

365
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,099
Have fun.

366
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,435
Bye! Love you, too!

367
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,089
I-I was gonna start
decorating the house

368
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,758
if you guys want to help.

369
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,347
Hello?

370
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,942
Shit.

371
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,533
Guys?

372
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,119
What do you want
for Christmas, Mia?

373
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,620
A dog.

374
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,710
I always wanted a dog
for Christmas,

375
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,129
and I never got one.

376
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,296
Why?

377
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,132
Uh...

378
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,883
Well, I didn't...
I didn't get presents

379
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,176
when I was a little girl.

380
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,595
And my-my dad was...

381
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,765
really serious about the Bible,

382
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:09,936
and it doesn't say anything
about presents in the Bible.

383
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,521
That's weird.

384
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,440
It is weird.

385
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,366
What kind of, um, dogs
do you like?

386
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,828
Bulldog.

387
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,205
Bulldogs are cute.

388
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,207
My dad doesn't want me

389
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,542
to get a dog, either.

390
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,046
He just thinks that
I'm not gonna take care of it.

391
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,465
Well, maybe
if you take good care

392
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,049
of your sea monkeys,
then you can get a dog.

393
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,719
I heard you can show your dad
that you can take care of...

394
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,220
Yeah.

395
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,432
I got Grady for myself
as a present to myself.

396
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:49,642
- Hmm.
- Whenever I...

397
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,436
was able to sort of

398
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:54,773
put all that behind me,
and he was my new life.

399
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,784
Do you want to see the present
that we made for my dad?

400
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,744
- Yeah.
- Okay.

401
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,166
Come down.

402
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,460
Okay.

403
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,378
Dad, watch!

404
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,637
Dad, watch!

405
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,893
- Hey.
- That's great work, Dad.

406
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,645
Mmm, this is good.

407
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,021
We have turkey hats.

408
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,818
Mm. What are you thankful
for? Because Thanksgiving

409
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,278
- is about being thankful.
- Mm-mm, no.

410
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,739
I'm thankful for my mom.

411
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,034
We did good.

412
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,954
We've done good.

413
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,299
We never have real turkey
on Thanksgiving, you know.

414
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,843
Hmm.

415
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,192
I'm gonna make something to eat
if you're hungry, Aiden.

416
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,364
Aiden?

417
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,202
Hello?

418
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,104
Grace, I can't find my doll.

419
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,110
Did you look
in your dad's room?

420
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,905
Grace, I haven't taken her
in there.

421
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,032
And you only took her here
and your room?

422
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,201
Did you look
in this... this room out here?

423
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,912
The... the room,
like, right here,

424
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:26,622
by the staircase.

425
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,916
I never take her in there.

426
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,044
Okay. I'm gonna check in there.
You want to come with me?

427
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,088
Well, I'm gonna look in there.

428
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,845
You want to look over there
in the...

429
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:42,763
by the shoe rack?

430
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,975
You don't know till you check.

431
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,023
Hmm.

432
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,151
Oh, my gosh! Grady!

433
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,153
What did you do?

434
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,197
Did you think it was a toy?

435
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,199
He must have thought
it was a toy.

436
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,475
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

437
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,644
<i>Um, I don't know why it's going
straight to voice mail,</i>

438
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,604
<i>but I just got
a missed call from you.</i>

439
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,232
Wanted to call you back,
but everything's okay,

440
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,567
and we're having fun.

441
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,361
We just watched a movie.

442
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,529
I made pancakes.

443
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,448
Um...

444
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,868
and we decorated the house
with Christmas stuff.

445
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,621
Try calling me back,

446
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,248
um, or text me.

447
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,832
Texting me is probably better.

448
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,167
I love you. Goodbye.

449
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,512
I'm making a sandwich,
Aiden, if you want one.

450
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,267
Aiden?

451
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,645
Hmm?

452
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,647
I'm making a sandwich
if you want one.

453
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,359
I'll make my own.

454
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,496
I think we need
to have a conversation, Aiden.

455
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,960
What?

456
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,299
I just feel like
things are very...

457
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,093
uncomfortable between us,
and I... I just wanted to know

458
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,846
if there's something I can do
to make... make that better,

459
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:49,223
or what-what your problem is.

460
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,477
Hormones?

461
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,983
Okay, I feel like
there's something

462
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,943
you're not saying to me, or...

463
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,862
I just want you to know
that I, I'm here

464
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,572
if you want to talk
to me about anything.

465
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,907
Why would I talk to you?

466
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,743
Because we're stuck
in a house together.

467
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,661
I didn't mean...

468
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:13,789
I didn't mean “stuck." I meant,
um, we're in a house together.

469
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,667
I want to be in the hou...
I mean...

470
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:19,795
I didn't mean...
I didn't mean that.

471
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,798
I just meant...
it would be a lot better,

472
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,593
I think, for both of us
if we could... talk.

473
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,723
I don't want to talk to you.

474
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,099
You don't want to talk to me?

475
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,559
Okay. You don't want
to talk to me.

476
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,227
You just want to watch me
in the shower.

477
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,026
You don't have anything
to say to me?

478
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:45,154
I just wanted to try
and make things better.

479
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,829
Oh, come on.

480
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,040
What were they doing
flying that low,

481
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,958
shooting at a dog?

482
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,752
Cabin fever. Who knows?

483
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,096
Go ahead.

484
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:13,391
Go ahead.
What are you waiting for?

485
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,851
Grace.

486
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,774
Is that for me?

487
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,901
Yes.

488
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,864
Thank you.

489
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:37,373
It's really cold.

490
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:41,210
Do you want some hot chocolate?

491
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,670
No, thank you.

492
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,758
Get your ass over here!

493
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,677
Well, you feel okay.

494
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,432
You want me
to go get the gas heater?

495
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,600
Yeah.

496
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,656
Damn it, Childs, torch it!

497
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:16,203
Is it safe
to have that on in the house?

498
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,498
Yeah, it's fine.

499
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,042
It always sounds like that.

500
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,961
Clear!

501
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,052
- Clear!
- Clear.

502
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,523
You guys want
to watch a different movie?

503
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,071
It's Christmas!

504
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,992
Merry Christmas, Dad!

505
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,577
Mer...

506
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:33,882
No! No!

507
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,045
Aiden.

508
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,338
Aiden?

509
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,048
The power's out

510
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,508
and the pipes are frozen.
Can you check the generator?

511
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,135
- Hmm. What time is it?
- I don't know.

512
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,638
My phone's dead. Check yours.

513
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,561
Mine's dead, too.

514
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,897
Where's the gas heater?

515
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,566
Did you move it?

516
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,361
- Aiden?
- What? No.

517
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,616
What is this?
Where is everything?

518
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,955
Did you do that?

519
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:31,166
Is this some kind of joke?

520
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,294
Grace!

521
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:50,060
If this is some kind of joke,
you got me, but it's not funny.

522
00:53:56,859 --> 00:54:00,279
Okay, I'm gonna go to my room,
and when I come back down,

523
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,741
all the food's gonna be back
and so is everything else.

524
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,148
Aiden! Mia!

525
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,567
Where are my things?

526
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:39,818
I need my pills.

527
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,987
Where are my pills?

528
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,491
We didn't do anything.

529
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,075
You took my pills

530
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,453
- and I want them back.
- We didn't do anything.

531
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:50,913
There's nobody else
in the fucking house, Aiden.

532
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,289
I don't know, maybe
you should ask yourself.

533
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,373
You're the one who's walking
through the house

534
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,374
all night long.

535
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,459
What?

536
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,170
We hear you every night.

537
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,005
So I took my fucking pills?

538
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,550
I'm gonna find my things.

539
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:05,219
Starting with your room.

540
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,475
Where is all your stuff?

541
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,230
Grace.

542
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,737
Stop.

543
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,072
Well, if you tell me

544
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:28,033
where my things are,
then I'll stop.

545
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,204
We didn't take anything.

546
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:39,253
Where's my doll?

547
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:50,013
Grady!

548
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,765
Grady!

549
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,059
Grady?

550
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,980
Grady!

551
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,565
Where's Grady?

552
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,024
What if he's outside?

553
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,026
How would he get outside?

554
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,362
Grady!

555
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:07,322
Grady!

556
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,241
Grady!

557
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,951
Grady!

558
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,369
Grady!

559
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,288
Grady!

560
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,294
Grady!

561
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,504
Grady!

562
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,470
Grady!

563
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,077
This fucking generator
won't work.

564
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,663
I don't know why.

565
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,582
No power.

566
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,336
How far is the nearest town?

567
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:05,047
It's miles.

568
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,008
And it's pointless without a car
in the storms.

569
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,344
The roads could be closed
for days.

570
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,995
I'm done.

571
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:52,636
I didn't want to say anything
in front of Mia, but, uh...

572
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,686
I had a, a weird dream
last night.

573
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:08,402
Well, uh, a nightmare,
but, um, in...

574
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:12,155
in... in the dream,
the gas heater started smoking

575
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:14,658
and we couldn't breathe, and...

576
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,160
uh, and...

577
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,706
...we suffocated.

578
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,382
Did you mess with the clocks?

579
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,303
No. Why?

580
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,520
Grace. Grace.

581
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,319
I've been playing
with Aiden a lot.

582
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,655
Yeah.

583
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,573
Just sleeping a lot.

584
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:22,911
Yeah, I miss you, too.

585
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,371
Yeah.

586
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:27,040
Okay.

587
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:30,460
Your phone's working?

588
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,630
It's-it's not working.

589
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:34,881
- So give me your phone.
- It's not working!

590
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,716
So let me have your phone!

591
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,725
I was just pretending.

592
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,355
I really miss Dad.

Repent your sins.

600
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:51,768
What?

601
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:54,104
I heard something.

602
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,398
- What?
- A voice.

603
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,568
Give me the flashlight.

604
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,913
Stay there.

605
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,092
It's just the window.

606
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,780
Repent.

607
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:29,157
Repent your sins.

608
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:46,549
You know how to open the door.

609
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:27,340
Just confess.

610
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,805
Repent your sins.

611
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,643
God's waiting.

612
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,880
<i>Grace.</i>

613
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:33,007
Grace.

614
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,469
Grace.

615
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:38,429
Grace?

616
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,014
Grace.

617
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,350
Grace!

618
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:43,601
Grace.

619
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:44,686
- Grace!
- Grace.

620
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:45,937
Aah!

621
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,773
Mia, you okay?

622
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:36,696
What are you doing?

623
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:40,658
We're leaving.

624
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,621
I need my pills, and we're
just gonna walk to the...

625
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:47,874
nearest town and call your dad.

626
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,542
Then he's gonna come pick us up.

627
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:52,086
So you have to pack your things.

628
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,672
What are you talking about?
We can't leave.

629
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:57,091
It's not up for discussion,
Aiden.

630
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,843
Look outside, Grace.

631
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,762
That's crazy.

632
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:05,933
We don't even have our jackets.

633
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,353
We're not going.

634
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,104
I'll go alone.

635
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,523
You won't make it.

636
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,195
Grace.

637
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,282
Grace.

638
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:27,497
Don't go.

639
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,938
Hello!

640
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,400
Hello!

641
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:27,533
Oh, God.

642
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,293
Grace.

643
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,314
Grace.

644
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,318
What is this?

645
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:13,783
I don't know, Aiden.

646
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:18,412
We're stuck here and we don't
know what's going on and-and...

647
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,165
And this picture...
what does it mean?

648
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,960
I don't know
what that photo means, Aiden.

649
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:28,589
What if we died?

650
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:33,010
We didn't die, Aiden.

651
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:34,762
How do you know?

652
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:37,014
If we had died,
how would we know?

653
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,684
Because it makes no sense.

654
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,686
Because I'm sitting here,
talking to you.

655
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:45,856
And because my feet are cold
and I'm hungry.

656
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:48,359
Maybe that's what it's like.

657
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:58,244
We wouldn't know if we died.

658
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,714
<i>Grace,</i>

659
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:12,008
<i>we must confess our sins</i>

660
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,635
<i>and cleanse our souls.</i>

661
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,971
<i>We're caught in purgatory.</i>

662
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,257
Would you like to pray?

663
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,931
Should we pray now?

664
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,189
Repent.

665
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,275
Repent your sins.

666
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:15,863
God's waiting.

667
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,719
<i>God...</i>

668
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,472
<i>He's so impatient,
and He can't wait</i>

669
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:45,351
<i>to see your smiling faces
today and tomorrow.</i>

670
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:47,353
<i>You're getting up for God.</i>

671
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:50,981
<i>You get to wake up, and He gets
to see you smile, my friends.</i>

672
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:55,194
<i>And you get to be
in His family now, His love.</i>

673
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:59,281
<i>I'd like you
to surrender your soul.</i>

674
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:02,034
<i>We know God is waiting.
It's time now.</i>

675
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:04,954
<i>It's time to open the door.</i>

676
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:08,916
<i>You and you alone hold the key,</i>

677
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,669
<i>and you know how
to open the door.</i>

678
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,441
Sorry for being
mean to my brother.

679
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,443
Sorry...

680
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:44,410
What is this?

681
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:51,625
Where did you get this?

682
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,169
Did you do that?

683
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:57,089
Grace, we must repent.

684
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:01,802
We must repent
for our sins, Grace.

685
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:03,804
- Stop, Aiden.
- You have to.

686
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:05,890
- Shut up, Aiden.
- You have to before it's too late.

687
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,391
- You have to repent.
- Shut up, Aiden.

688
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:08,601
- So that we can go to Heaven.
- Stop, Aiden.

689
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:09,602
You have to repent...

690
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:11,645
I said, stop it, Aiden.

691
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:12,980
You have to repent before...

692
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,773
- Stop it, Aiden!
- You have to atone...

693
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:16,066
Shut up!

694
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:17,610
- Stop it!
- You have to...

695
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:19,111
I said, stop it!

696
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:20,863
Stop it!

697
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:23,282
- Shut the fuck up, Aiden!
- You have to tell the truth.

698
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:24,658
- Shut up!
- You have to repent for your sins!

699
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:27,244
- You have to repent!
- Stop!

700
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:28,495
- You have to!
- Shut up!

701
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:29,663
Shut up, shut up!

702
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,374
I'll prove it to you.

703
01:18:57,691 --> 01:19:01,237
Grace! Grace!

704
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:02,988
Grace!

705
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:21,882
Do you see now?

706
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:25,219
You see, we cannot die.

707
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:27,763
You're already dead.

708
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:30,891
We're caught in purgatory.

709
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:34,019
We must confess our sins
and cleanse our souls

710
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:36,355
in order to go to Heaven, Grace.

711
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,984
Confess!

712
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:42,444
Repent! Repent your sins!

713
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:52,746
Please...

714
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,249
please protect me.

715
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,876
Please, Mother.

716
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:59,628
Please protect me.

717
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,463
Please help me.

718
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:03,340
Would you like to pray?

719
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:07,511
Holy Mother, please protect me!

720
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:09,680
Should we pray now?

721
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:12,057
Why did you leave me?!

722
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:19,273
Repent. Repent your sins.

723
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:24,695
Just confess.

724
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,614
God is waiting.

725
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,838
Please help me, Lord.

726
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:48,510
I know that I've sinned...

727
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,429
and I'm sorry.

728
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:56,393
Please forgive me.

729
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,744
Grady.

730
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:16,538
Grady?

731
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,085
Grady?

732
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,088
Grady!

733
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,006
No, don't, Mia. Mia...

734
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,136
Fuck.

735
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:57,788
It was my fault, Grace.

736
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:00,499
Grace.

737
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:02,543
I left the door open.

738
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,047
I'm so sorry.

739
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:11,677
Grady.

740
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:19,309
I'm-I'm so sorry.

741
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,691
Grace.

742
01:22:25,732 --> 01:22:27,693
Please come inside, Grace.

743
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:32,239
Grace... it's too cold.

744
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:34,158
Please come inside.

745
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,641
I don't know what to do.

746
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:05,814
She's gonna
freeze to death, Aiden.

747
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,858
I know.

748
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,701
We have to convince her
or something.

749
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,877
We have to...

750
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,672
We have to stop this.

751
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:32,257
I know.

752
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:59,076
You see her pills?

753
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,927
Grace?

754
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:26,562
Come on.

755
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,274
- Grace, come on.
- Let's go inside.

756
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:35,445
Come on.
It's too cold, Grace.

757
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:43,036
It's too cold.

758
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,955
Come inside.

759
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,959
We were just pretending.

760
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:52,546
We didn't die.

761
01:24:53,964 --> 01:24:55,966
Grace, I...

762
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,388
I actually didn't hang myself.

763
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:06,977
None of it was real.

764
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:09,396
Look, can we...
can we just go inside, please?

765
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:15,235
We're all sinners on Earth.

766
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,699
And may the Lord forgive us

767
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:23,201
so we can be welcome
into the kingdom of Heaven.

768
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:35,714
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

769
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:39,426
hallowed be Thy name.

770
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:42,095
Thy kingdom come.

771
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,681
Thy will be done
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

772
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:16,546
It's not working.

773
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:18,674
Fuck, fucking...

774
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:23,053
Fuck.

775
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:34,731
Phone charger's out.
We need power.

776
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,820
Give me your phone.

777
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,738
It's dead, too.

778
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:47,077
Sorry. I was on the phone
with Dad too much.

779
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:14,563
Maybe we should
give her another sleeping pill.

780
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:21,505
I repent...

781
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:25,425
the harm I've brought
to this family.

782
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:27,803
I repent my...

783
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:36,102
The lies I told...

784
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,897
and my desire and my fornication

785
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:40,649
and my impurity.

786
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:50,534
It's okay.

787
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:03,547
It's okay. Just...

788
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:48,925
Hey, it's me.

789
01:29:48,967 --> 01:29:50,886
Uh, I-I called you guys
all day yesterday,

790
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:53,054
but I can't seem
to get through to anybody.

791
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:55,765
I'm leaving now. It's gonna
take about five or six hours.

792
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,393
Depends if the roads are open,
but, um...

793
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:00,020
I hope you're okay.

794
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,272
And call me
when you get this message.

795
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:36,848
Mia?

796
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:40,352
I have to go to the bathroom.

797
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:41,770
Just go in the corner.

798
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:43,939
We can't go down there
right now.

799
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:48,944
Mia, don't.

800
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:34,758
Mia.

801
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:41,306
Aiden.

802
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,274
Go away.

803
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:54,444
You don't have to be afraid.

804
01:32:54,486 --> 01:32:56,404
It's okay, Mia.

805
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,788
You have nothing
to be scared of.

806
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:07,373
It's fine.

807
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:12,504
Death is already behind us.

808
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:16,549
We're not dead.
We're not dead.

809
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,176
We were just pretending.

810
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:20,929
We were just
pretending.

811
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:22,680
- That's all.
- We did it for Mommy!

812
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:26,101
Christ suffered in the flesh.

813
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:31,314
You have to release yourself
from earthly sins, Mia.

814
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:34,192
You need to sacrifice something
for the Lord, Mia.

815
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,237
No.

816
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:39,197
- Mia.
- Please.

817
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:41,449
- Burn her.
- Stop.

818
01:33:41,491 --> 01:33:44,244
You have to free yourself
from idols.

819
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:45,912
You need to burn her, Mia.

820
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:48,039
No!

821
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:49,791
Please stop!

822
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:52,794
- Stop it!
- Mia! Mia!

823
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:58,007
Mia.

824
01:33:58,049 --> 01:33:59,717
No!

825
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:01,136
- Hey.
- It's okay. It's okay.

826
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:02,846
It's okay.

827
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:06,432
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay, okay?

828
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:08,434
Look. Look, trust me.

829
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:10,520
You need to trust me, okay?

830
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:12,772
- Grace.
- Look, watch.

831
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:14,023
- Mia.
- Stop.

832
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:15,775
- Grace, stop!
- Don't.

833
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:32,834
Grace?

834
01:34:52,562 --> 01:34:54,522
Grace?

835
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:56,107
Aiden?

836
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:00,737
Grace.

837
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:03,031
Richard.

838
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:08,119
Hey, sweetie.

839
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:10,955
God is punishing us.

840
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:14,667
For, for what we did.

841
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:18,546
We didn't do anything.

842
01:35:18,588 --> 01:35:20,173
Oh, my God.

843
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:22,342
Baby. No, no, don't.

844
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:24,260
Don't do that, Grace.

845
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:25,678
Shh, it's okay.

846
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,680
You don't understand.

847
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:31,434
Look at me.

848
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:33,311
I'm already dead.

849
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:36,439
Please don't do that.

850
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:38,524
I've exited this vehicle,

851
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:40,985
and now I have to go
through the pain

852
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:42,612
and tortures of purgatory.

853
01:35:44,614 --> 01:35:46,574
You're not dead.

854
01:35:46,616 --> 01:35:48,117
There is no purgatory.

855
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,410
Look.

856
01:35:49,452 --> 01:35:50,787
I'll show you.

857
01:35:50,828 --> 01:35:52,038
Baby.

858
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:55,458
Don't do this.

859
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:03,508
I told you.

860
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:06,886
Give me the gun.

861
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:11,307
It's okay.

862
01:36:11,349 --> 01:36:13,518
You're not listening.

863
01:36:13,559 --> 01:36:15,353
I'm listening.

864
01:36:15,395 --> 01:36:16,854
Come on.

865
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:19,941
Give it to me.

866
01:36:19,983 --> 01:36:21,359
No.

867
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:23,236
See?

868
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:26,072
You feel that?

869
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:27,949
- Let it go.
- You don't get it.

870
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:31,995
- Dad.
- Dad!

871
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:34,914
- Dad!
- Dad! Dad! Dad!

872
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:36,165
- Richard.
- Dad!

873
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:39,043
Dad.

874
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:41,296
No!

875
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:44,549
Dad!

876
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:46,801
- No!
- Mia. Mia, now.

877
01:36:46,843 --> 01:36:48,845
- Richard.
- Mia!

878
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:50,346
- Now!
- No!

879
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:52,849
- Come on.
- No!

880
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,357
Richard?

881
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:10,950
Richard?

882
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:51,366
She's coming!

883
01:37:51,407 --> 01:37:53,951
Aiden, help!

884
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:00,958
Aiden!

885
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:15,306
Come on!

886
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:18,976
Aiden, go!

887
01:38:19,018 --> 01:38:21,396
Come on!

888
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:22,688
Oh, my God.

889
01:38:56,264 --> 01:38:59,559
Let us pray to our Lord...

890
01:39:01,269 --> 01:39:05,231
...that He can forgive
your father Richard.

891
01:39:05,273 --> 01:39:08,901
That he makes his way
into the kingdom of Heaven.

892
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:11,529
May He forgive us of our sins

893
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:15,491
so that we may be reunited
for eternity.

894
01:39:15,533 --> 01:39:17,410
Amen.
