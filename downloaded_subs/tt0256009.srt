1
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,919
What is a ghost?

2
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,274
A tragedy condemned
to repeat itself time and again?

3
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,076
An instant of pain, perhaps.

4
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,873
Something dead which still seems to be alive.

5
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,395
An emotion suspended in time.

6
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,312
Like a blurred photograph.

7
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,389
Like an insect trapped in amber.

8
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,671
THE DEVlL`S BACKBONE

9
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,069
We`ll be there soon.

10
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,949
What the...?

11
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,712
It fell quite a while ago, but it never exploded.

12
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,669
They came...

13
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,515
...they defused it...

14
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,313
...and they left it there. Nobody can move it.

15
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,669
Follow me, please.

16
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,951
Carlos...

17
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,550
Wait for me here. We won`t be long.

18
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,389
Who are those people outside?

19
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,993
The caretaker and two men who help him.

20
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,671
They`re from the town.
There`s always work to do here.

21
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,798
They`re building a chicken coop.

22
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,869
What`s going on out there?

23
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,669
-They`ve arrived.
-Ayala and Dominguez again?

24
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,959
Yes. Ayala`s wounded.

25
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,032
They`re always in trouble.

26
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,429
They`ve brought another boy.

27
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,711
As if we didn`t have enough already.

28
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,229
Let`s go.

29
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,229
Are you a new kid?

30
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,598
Got any candy? Or a bit of bread?

31
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,278
l`m Galvez, he`s Owl.
He doesn`t speak but he looks a lot.

32
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,749
l`m Carlos.

33
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,398
Got any fruit, even if it`s soft?

34
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,438
No, but l`ve got some comics and toys.

35
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,676
-Want to see them?
-Yeah.

36
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,429
I can`t do it.

37
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,232
I can`t accept another boy.

38
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,275
I can barely feed the ones who are here.
l`m sorry.

39
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,152
He`s the son of a comrade killed at the front.

40
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,629
The boy doesn`t know.

41
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,549
He doesn`t know.

42
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,591
Your husband was a leftist, a brave man.

43
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,629
Oh, no!

44
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,715
l`m the brave one.

45
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,598
Ricardo was a man of books of ideas.

46
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,354
He decided to die and leave me
here to defend his ideals.

47
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,513
The Nationalists will arrive any day
and what will they find?

48
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,199
Reds looking after the children of Reds.

49
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,989
Not to mention this!

50
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,316
I can`t keep it anymore.
If you want to leave the boy,...

51
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,389
...take the rest of the gold.

52
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,429
There are 10 ingots left.

53
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,353
At least you can buy guns.

54
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,274
I can`t even buy bread with it.

55
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,869
Take it away.

56
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,269
We can`t.

57
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,196
-We`re crossing enemy lines.
-You decide.

58
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,592
The boy goes hungry here
or gets killed out there.

59
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,549
Class time!

60
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,869
Come on!

61
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,869
Look, Owl, a comic book!

62
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,829
l`ll swap you.

63
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,112
Look at this marble. lt`s my favorite.
lt`s from China.

64
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,468
Or look at this one.

65
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,069
Owl made it himself.

66
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,638
All made from snot and mud.
lt`s six months of snot.

67
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,633
Hey, you! That`s mine!

68
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,993
-Are you here to stay?
-No.

69
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,838
Then why are you here?

70
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,232
I came with Mr Ayala, my tutor.

71
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,275
What`s a tutor?

72
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,958
He looks after me while my father`s away.

73
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,709
Shit, that`s posh!

74
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,869
No one here has one of those.

75
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,391
Take the comic from me. Go on.

76
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,879
Take it away. C`mon.

77
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,349
Carlos, look!

78
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,873
Mr. Ayala.

79
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,996
Your tutor`s leaving you, faggot!

80
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,839
Stay with him for a while.

81
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,549
He seems well behaved.

82
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,668
l`m sure you`ll get along.

83
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,269
We`ll have to fix it.

84
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,789
``The Count of Monte-Cristo.``

85
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,636
Has Edmond Dantes broken out of prison yet?

86
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,988
-Has he met Abbot Faria?
-They`re digging a tunnel.

87
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,960
-Do they manage to escape?
-I don`t know.

88
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,909
Why don`t you read on and tell me?

89
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,709
There are only three teachers left.
The lady with glasses is Alma.

90
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,032
She teaches maths and reading.

91
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,349
And the elegant lady you saw, remember?

92
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,869
Her name is Carmen.

93
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,836
-ls she your girlfriend?
-She`s the principal.

94
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,635
Why did they leave me here?

95
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,235
Why can`t I be with my father?

96
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,469
Carlitos...

97
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,914
...you`re staying with us for a while.

98
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,749
Just for a while.

99
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,469
So be patient.

100
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,713
Your soap has to last you all year.

101
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,755
Be careful with it...

102
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,549
...or you`ll be punished with
two weeks of extra tasks.

103
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,314
You can play in the yard,
but never inside the building.

104
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,269
This is your bed.

105
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,869
Number 12.

106
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,958
Why are there so many empty beds?

107
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,075
Some boys run away, but I wouldn`t advise it.

108
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,628
lt`s a day`s walk to town.

109
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,438
The nights are cold and the days...

110
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,435
For your locker.

111
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,195
Do you understand?

112
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,754
There are no bars here. This isn`t a prison.

113
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,392
See where they put the new kid?

114
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,559
-ln Santi`s bed.
-Shut up!

115
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,680
pig and I think that even though
you complain a lot...

116
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,069
...you`re all right here.

117
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,630
Far away from the war, well hidden.

118
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,949
Well looked after.

119
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,958
-What could be better?
-Granada.

120
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,079
Why go to Granada?

121
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,715
We`re getting married.

122
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,432
We want to buy a farm there.

123
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,349
Sure.

124
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,789
Granada!

125
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,752
Does Conchita have family there?
Do you know anyone?

126
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,389
I don`t need anyone.

127
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,712
l`ve managed fine on my own up to now.

128
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,389
Right.

129
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,755
And without parents.

130
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,350
Those Reds we saw were here for the gold.

131
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,916
-Yeah, the school`s gold.
-That`s why they eat so well here.

132
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,909
You don`t believe me now...

133
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,149
...but you will.

134
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,069
l`ll try these two tonight
and let you know what happens.

135
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,228
That`s great, kid.

136
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,269
Got a smoke?

137
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,110
-No.
-All right, so long.

138
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,234
I don`t like those two.

139
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,949
...l`d stand here...

140
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,109
...in the middle of the yard...

141
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,074
...and l`d look up at the sky.

142
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,359
I dreamed of getting out of here.

143
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,389
I prayed to become rich...

144
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,589
...so I could buy this dump and tear it down.

145
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,435
You`re so complicated.

146
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,191
I don`t want anyone to know
I spent 15 years here.

147
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,639
Well, l`m glad you came back.

148
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,916
Let`s go to my room, it`s getting cold.

149
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,394
San... ti...

150
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,908
Who are you?

151
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,389
What are you doing?

152
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,874
-Me? Nothing.
-What the hell`s going on?

153
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,397
The fucking new kid spilled our water.

154
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,155
Come on.

155
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,913
You`ll have to get more from the kitchen.

156
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,589
lsn`t that off limits?

157
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,669
No one`s ever been caught.

158
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,995
What about the ``one who sighs``?

159
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,196
What`s it to be? Are you going or not?

160
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,189
Who`s the ``one who sighs``?

161
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,789
You`re chickenshit.

162
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,069
No, l`m not.

163
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,598
You`re a shit, a queer.

164
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,869
All right, l`ll go.

165
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,069
But you`re coming with me.

166
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,913
We`ll each fill a jug.

167
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,113
But if you`re scared...

168
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,629
They say it`s switched off.

169
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,709
But I don`t believe it.

170
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,910
Put your ear against it, you`ll hear ticking.

171
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,311
That`s its heart. lt`s still alive.

172
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,029
And it knows we`re here.

173
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,829
Hide!

174
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,429
That one.

175
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,429
C`mon.

176
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,549
See you outside.

177
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,592
``No one`s ever been caught.`` Bastard.

178
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,629
Shit!

179
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,749
Hello.

180
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,429
Who are you?

181
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,995
Do you live down here?

182
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,399
Many of you will die.

183
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,269
Jaime!

184
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,678
What are you up to?

185
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,789
``Out, out,...

186
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,435
...yearnings of mine. Let not respect bind you.

187
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,509
It flatters pity...

188
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,075
It flatters pity not to be able to hide.

189
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,238
Let your lips bear witness...
...to the blaze in your heart.

190
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,351
No one will believe the fire
if the smoke sends no signals.

191
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,197
He who cares for his wellbeing
keeps not his feelings silent.

192
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,429
My grief is greater than l

193
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,753
And that being so...

194
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,234
...it will be easier...

195
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,474
...it will be easier....

196
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,359
...for it to defeat me...

197
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,633
...than for I to command it.

198
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,237
Consideration does not suffice
to prevent the cry.

199
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,555
He is not a brave prisoner.

200
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,038
Who dares not break down his gaol.``

201
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:39,559
A grain of strength.

202
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,756
Carlos, are you going to tell me
who was with you last night?

203
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,474
He`s not going to tell.

204
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,069
He`ll squeal in the end, just wait and see.

205
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,949
You understand?

206
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,839
Then, for the last time...

207
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,038
Who was with you last night?

208
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,589
I was alone.

209
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,035
That boy won`t talk.

210
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,753
If we want to know who was with him...

211
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,078
-What`s for breakfast?
-Milk and bread.

212
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,229
Perfect.

213
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,229
Very well.

214
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,869
You may begin.

215
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,873
They think Carlos has told, but they don`t care.

216
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,031
They`re ravenous, look at how they`re eating.

217
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,473
The first one to look up from his plate
is his accomplice.

218
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,473
Marcos,......Galvez, Jaime and Owl.

219
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,589
Come here.

220
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,913
I knew you wouldn`t squeal.

221
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,833
Dr. Casares tricked me.

222
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,669
That`s what I said.

223
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,279
It isn`t your fault, we were punished.

224
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,479
Dr. Casares is real smart.

225
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,829
He sure is!

226
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,675
Careful.

227
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,389
Come on, Owl.

228
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,270
Shit, for a dead guy, he sure weighs a lot!

229
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,269
Well, well!

230
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,788
Christ in the yard and John the Baptist in here.

231
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,949
Are things that bad?

232
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,148
If the new Spain is Catholic and apostolic...

233
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,189
Try it now.

234
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,189
I told you.

235
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,949
Dance with me.

236
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,309
-No.
-Come on.

237
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,593
-No.
-Come on, dance with me.

238
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,029
I can`t dance.

239
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,669
Ayala said so.

240
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,629
Catalonia is about to fall.

241
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,790
Then Madrid will fall, and then...

242
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,592
-There`s talk of a ghost. Have you heard?
-Yes.

243
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,955
Sometimes I think that we are the ghosts.

244
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,440
Galvez... Last night, you didn`t shoot.

245
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,639
That`s right.

246
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,669
Wow, that`s great!

247
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,229
lt`s for you.

248
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,749
Why are they laughing?

249
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,273
Go back to Argentina, while you still can.

250
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,119
The war isn`t over yet, Carmen.

251
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,399
England or France might still intervene.

252
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,271
That`s just wishful thinking.

253
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,558
-You`re like Ricardo.
-No.

254
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,235
No, l`m not like him.

255
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,475
20 years ago, I found the place for me.

256
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,150
And I stayed. That`s all.

257
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,353
Look at it jump!

258
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,115
Where`s the new kid?

259
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,039
Are you the ``one who sighs``?

260
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,549
Do you live down there?

261
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,589
Listen...

262
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,349
What are you up to?

263
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,069
Go on, call Dr. Casares.

264
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,109
Ass-kisser!

265
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,717
Throw him down! Go on!

266
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,749
He can`t swim!

267
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,636
-Over there!
-Over there, to your left!

268
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,909
There he is!

269
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,314
Grab him! Careful!

270
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,549
What`s going on?

271
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,749
What have I told you?

272
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,468
And you, eh?

273
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,836
What the fuck are you doing down here?

274
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,189
Whose is this?

275
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,269
Whose is this?

276
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,709
lt`s mine.

277
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,236
If anything happens to you, I get the blame.

278
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,029
Get out!

279
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,389
Out!

280
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,833
Say a word about this and l`ll cut you in half.

281
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,275
Got that?

282
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,029
There you go.

283
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,592
Our Carlos has been here five minutes...

284
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,559
...and he`s in trouble already.

285
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,559
Have you read any more of ``Monte-Cristo``?

286
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,394
Do you believe in ghosts?

287
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,754
There aren`t any in the novel.

288
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,076
I think I saw one, here.

289
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,311
Carlos, as you can see,...

290
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,828
...l`m a man of science.

291
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,070
But Spain is full of superstition.

292
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,109
Come here.

293
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,639
Europe is sick with fear now,
and fear sickens the soul.

294
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,117
And that, in turn, makes us see things.

295
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,429
in town...

296
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,029
...they call this...

297
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,715
...``the devil`s backbone``

298
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,309
They say a lot of things.

299
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,195
That this happens to children
who shouldn`t have been born.

300
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,995
``Nobody`s children.`` But that`s a lie.

301
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,352
Poverty and disease. That`s all there is.

302
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,315
The liquid they`re in is called ``limbo water``

303
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,398
In the old days,
it was made with various spices...

304
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,397
...cloves, rum...

305
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,278
So this is very, very old rum.

306
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,429
I sell it in town...

307
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,837
...and the money keeps the school going.

308
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,589
Do they drink it?

309
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,029
They say it helps...

310
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,075
...to cure blindness, kidney ailments...

311
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,835
...and also, apparently,...

312
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,679
...impotence.

313
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,273
Rubbish, but you know...

314
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,235
After 60, men will pay anything just to...

315
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,069
You know.

316
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,431
So if you`re going to believe in ghosts
and all that rubbish...

317
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,549
... you should have a sip of this...

318
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,829
...to heal your wound.

319
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,477
No, l`m not sure that I saw a ghost.
May I go now?

320
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,518
Yes, of course.

321
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,109
And be more careful?

322
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,759
Calm down.

323
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,069
l`m not going to hit you.

324
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,869
So don`t make any noise.

325
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,749
Carlos...

326
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,157
...get out your comics so we can look at them.

327
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,512
-That ring`s pretty.
-lt`s from a cigar.

328
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,428
I found it four summers ago.

329
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,109
lt`s very pretty.

330
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,156
Hey, Carlos, let`s swap.

331
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,509
Look.

332
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,029
A naked woman.

333
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,759
lt`s really well drawn, like a photo.

334
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,675
She`s a looker! Who drew this?

335
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,909
Her pussy`s the wrong way round.

336
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,839
It looks like a mouth.

337
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,635
What would you lot know?

338
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,879
Look, a slice of fig cake.

339
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,396
lt`s a bit squashed but it tastes good.

340
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,838
No, give me back my comics.

341
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,069
I want it back.

342
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,789
All right.

343
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,631
l`ll give it to you later. lt`s in my locker.

344
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,829
You`re a real artist.

345
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,113
When I grow up, I want to draw comics.

346
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,429
Like mine?

347
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,232
No, much better.
With more fights, more treasures.

348
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,559
And big ships with lots of cannons.

349
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,469
These bugs are disgusting. What do they eat?

350
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,829
Did you hear that?

351
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,309
A sigh.

352
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,469
I didn`t hear it.

353
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,069
I heard it too.

354
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,159
Don`t kiss me.

355
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,514
Right, I forgot.

356
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,789
This is the last time.

357
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,749
``This is the last time.``

358
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,155
Same old story.

359
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,755
Don`t make any noise.

360
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,314
Scared the old man will hear?

361
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,075
l`ve never been scared.

362
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,709
l`m ashamed.

363
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,669
Yeah.

364
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,068
You`re ashamed of me.

365
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,349
Not him.

366
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,989
He`s a gentleman.

367
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,152
What a pity that isn`t enough.

368
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,278
You need a hard cock as well.

369
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,754
And your husband and the doctor...

370
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,669
Tough luck.

371
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,953
The old man looks at you with love.

372
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,313
He did that even when your husband was alive.

373
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,229
I was 17.

374
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,389
By then, they took care of the poetry...

375
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,275
...and I of the flesh.

376
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,429
This leg...

377
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,798
I don`t like to think about this leg.

378
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,029
It hurts.

379
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,073
Some days I can`t bear it.

380
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,951
But I need it to stay on my feet.

381
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,233
I saw those lights again today,...

382
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,269
...in the sky.

383
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,199
That`s the war, it`ll never end.

384
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,875
The war`s shit.

385
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,675
Well, like it.

386
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,754
You like it, dickhead?

387
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,999
Yeah, because you see the planes doing this.

388
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,437
My mother says that the earth`s so dry here.

389
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,669
and the air`s so hot...

390
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,871
...that the dead get stuck half way to heaven.

391
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,792
-That`s rubbish!
-lt`s like the ``one who sighs``.

392
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,670
Not that again, you little shit!

393
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,552
Even if it annoys him, there is a ghost.

394
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,192
The day the bomb fell, a boy disappeared. Santi.

395
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,836
Since then, no one has dared take Jaime on.

396
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,430
Santi slept in your bed, number 12.

397
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,159
Shit, l`m telling the story.

398
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,830
The teachers think that when the bomb fell...

399
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,469
...Santi got scared and ran away...

400
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,470
...and maybe some shepherds found him
and he`s alive.

401
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,434
Or a cutthroat got him and took his blood.

402
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,549
Yeah.

403
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,117
They sell the blood to rich people
to cure their tuberculosis.

404
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,109
And where`s the ghost?

405
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,029
It came with the bomb.

406
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,468
Maybe if you ask it...

407
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,389
Take that one.

408
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,549
Out of the way.

409
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,671
Put those in, but be careful!

410
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,629
Don`t break them.

411
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,589
Miss...

412
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,153
Look, I found this.

413
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,629
I thought you`d like it.

414
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,509
Open the gate, Jaime.

415
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,395
lt`s lovely.

416
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,911
It looks like gold, but it isn`t.

417
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,070
Well, for me, it is.

418
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,149
lt`s beautiful.

419
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,869
Thank you.

420
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,269
What`s that?

421
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,829
Kids` stuff.

422
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,749
Can anyone tell me...

423
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,629
...what these elegant gentlemen are hunting?

424
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,233
-Galvez?
-A pig.

425
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,555
Well, a boar.

426
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,995
Why not a giraffe?

427
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,349
Carlos?

428
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,389
A mammoth.

429
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,396
-Very good. And what`s a mammoth?
-An ancestor of the elephant.

430
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,429
Very good.

431
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,509
Your tutor taught you that.

432
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,191
In those days, men had to act in groups.

433
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,153
No one could give up.

434
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,039
lmagine the death of a mammoth.

435
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,994
It must have been terrible.

436
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,316
A mammoth steak, great!

437
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,428
When you get to draw your comics...

438
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,275
...l could help you write the stories.

439
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,149
I don`t need anyone.

440
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,911
My stories and my drawings are mine, got that?

441
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,750
Tomorrow, we`ll continue with
the second part of prehistory.

442
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,431
Leave your things in the dormitory.

443
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,269
Then it`s recess.

444
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,389
Santi...

445
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,832
-Satisfaction guaranteed.
-I hope so.

446
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,469
Here you go.

447
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,829
There isn`t much.

448
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,594
Hey, you! Bastards!

449
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,189
What`s going on?

450
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,197
lnternational Brigade. 2 Spaniards,
6 Canadians, 1 Chinaman.

451
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,830
What the fuck`s a Chinaman
doing in a Spanish war?

452
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,435
You, look at your damn feet!

453
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,194
Someone you know, doctor?

454
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,515
Bomb...

455
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,949
If you`re alive...

456
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,229
...tell me where Santi is.

457
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,629
Santi...

458
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,269
Talk to me.

459
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,154
I don`t want anyone to die.

460
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,077
Many of you will die.

461
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,229
Please.

462
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:13,075
A grain of strength.

463
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,792
-You`re up late.
-Please, give me a minute.

464
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,714
I need to talk to you,
but I don`t want the boys to hear.

465
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,789
Things are very bad out there.

466
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,352
-ls something wrong?
-Yes.

467
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,391
We have to leave. Today if possible.

468
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,757
-Ayala was taken prisoner...
-Ayala?

469
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,633
Yes, l`m sure they questioned him.
We have to go.

470
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,749
Go where?

471
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,552
To Marseille, with the Ricards.

472
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,512
-We can`t stay here another minute.
-But I can`t leave the boys!

473
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,395
Very well, we`ll take them, as many as we can.

474
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,114
-We`ll use the gold.
-The gold belongs to the cause.

475
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,716
Fuck the cause, Carmen, fuck the cause!

476
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,597
I always thought there`d be an afterwards.

477
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,949
There is no afterwards!

478
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,149
Carmen...

479
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,555
...if anything happened you...

480
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,549
Doctor...

481
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,478
The boys are waiting for your permission
to have breakfast.

482
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,759
l`ll need some papers.

483
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,515
But we`ll go.

484
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,915
Boys, you may start.

485
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,631
Come along. Get started, please.

486
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,229
Get started.

487
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,395
My mother wrote to me.

488
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,789
She`s a lot better.

489
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,599
She`s coming for me soon.

490
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,553
Last night I saw the ``one who sighs``

491
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,829
Last night?

492
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,309
You`re making it up.

493
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,669
lt`s Santi.

494
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,389
l`m sure.

495
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,189
Are you leaving?

496
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,749
Where are you going?

497
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,954
What about me?

498
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,959
Fuck me, right?

499
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,349
Well, good.

500
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,913
I want you to finish breakfast,
but while you`re doing so...

501
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:51,873
...listen very carefully because
I have to tell you something...

502
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,911
You can go, but the gold stays here.

503
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,509
The gold?

504
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,273
Is that all you care about?

505
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,033
That`s it.

506
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,149
What are you doing?

507
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,790
I hid you here so you wouldn`t die outside...

508
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,951
-...with no one to mourn you.
-Give me the key.

509
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,549
You know what?

510
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,477
Of all the orphans, you were always the saddest.

511
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,429
The lost one.

512
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,309
A prince without a kingdom.

513
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,749
Shut up!

514
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,473
-The only one who was really alone.
-I said, shut up!

515
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,756
Get out of here, or l`ll kill you!

516
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,909
Look who`s come to save you.

517
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,349
The old sage.

518
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,389
Will this weapon work?

519
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,558
You know that while you say sweet things
to this old hag...

520
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,433
...l`m the one who screws her?

521
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,029
And now...

522
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,909
...get out.

523
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,669
What did you see?

524
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:48,909
You know already.

525
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,758
I don`t know anything. Tell me.

526
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,909
Santi.

527
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,912
He`s the ``one who sighs``.

528
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,469
He`s dead, isn`t he?

529
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,109
Come on, boys.

530
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,029
Conchita...

531
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,270
Would you bring me a few cans of gas
for the journey?

532
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,715
Please, no!

533
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,913
You`ll all travel in the back of the truck.

534
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,309
l`ll be a long journey.

535
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,035
The older boys will have to
look after the little ones.

536
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,320
If any of you are scared you can sit with me.

537
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,429
What are you doing?

538
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,232
Are you all right, ma`am?

539
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,719
lt`s my bad leg.

540
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,029
lt`s heavier than ever.

541
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,594
Did you think someone would
just give us a farm?

542
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,469
What are you doing with that?

543
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,229
You`re crazy.

544
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,109
They`re all inside.

545
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,869
You going to shoot me?

546
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,029
Please...

547
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,308
-What was that?
-The children!

548
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,592
Get them out! lt`s going to blow up!

549
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,989
Get out!

550
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,989
Outside!

551
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:19,949
Carmen?

552
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,195
Alma, leave it be, come on!

553
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,669
Get out!

554
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,469
All of you!

555
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,834
-l`m very cold.
-lt`s all right.

556
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,233
Don`t move.

557
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,959
Don`t move, don`t look.

558
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,629
Is it bad?

559
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,389
Fetch my bag from the lab. Quickly!

560
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,151
They won`t have heard the explosion in town.

561
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,514
And it was just one of many.
We can`t expect any help.

562
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,788
If I walk all night,
l`ll get to town by noon tomorrow.

563
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,989
l`ve...

564
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,598
l`ve got something to tell you.

565
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,593
-lf I don`t tell you now...
-No, please, don`t.

566
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,232
I couldn`t...

567
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,272
I can`t hear you. So, please...

568
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,069
This time...

569
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,792
...let me do the talking.

570
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,674
-l`ve learned a new poem.
-Yes.

571
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,353
A poem.

572
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,035
``Stay by my side as my light grows dim,...

573
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,359
...as my blood slows down...

574
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,474
...and my nerves shatter with stabbing pain...

575
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,752
...as my heart grows weak...

576
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,991
...and the wheels of my being turn slowly.

577
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,749
Stay by my side...

578
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,269
...as my fragile body is racked by pain...

579
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,839
...which verges on truth...

580
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:13,873
...and manic time...

581
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,439
...continues scattering dust...

582
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,989
...and furious life bursts out in flames.

583
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,034
Stay by my side...

584
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,429
...as I fade...

585
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,669
...so you can point to the end of my struggle...

586
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,395
...and the twilight...

587
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,153
...of eternal days...

588
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,998
...at the low, dark edge of life.``

589
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,109
Miss...

590
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,634
A grain of strength.

591
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,669
Carlos, look.

592
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,309
Dr Casares...

593
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,078
That son of a bitch...

594
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,831
I should have killed him when I had the chance.

595
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,629
But he`ll be back.

596
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,269
And l`ll be here...

597
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:21,989
...waiting for him.

598
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,349
Carlitos...

599
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:27,909
...bring me...

600
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,310
...my records, my music.

601
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,151
I need them. All right?

602
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,709
Are you hungry?

603
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,350
``Eat beans, good for the heart.

604
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:15,629
The more you eat, the more you fart.``

605
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,195
My stomach`s all upset.

606
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,758
But the little ones might be hungry.

607
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,154
Could you kill someone?

608
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,709
I could.

609
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,279
What you said about Santi is true.

610
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,829
He`s dead.

611
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,715
But I didn`t kill him.

612
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,675
-I thought...
-I was with him.

613
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,229
I saw everything.

614
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,389
It started in the pit.

615
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:57,589
I dared him to come down with me
at night to gather slugs.

616
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,999
Run, Jaime. Jacinto`s here.

617
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,839
-What did you see?
-Nothing.

618
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,069
-Did you see the safe?
-No.

619
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,269
Did you see the safe?

620
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:13,509
Why the fuck are you in here?

621
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:16,789
Who was with you?

622
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,149
Get up.

623
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,429
Get up.

624
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,309
I was a coward.

625
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,198
I was always afraid of Jacinto.

626
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,989
Very afraid.

627
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,555
But not anymore.

628
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,917
The next time I see him...

629
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,068
...l know l`m going to kill him.

630
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:18,509
Look who`s here.

631
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,069
What`ll he do?

632
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,073
Say you`re sorry and get in the car.

633
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,355
l`m not scared of you.

634
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,233
You`re making me look like a fool.

635
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,151
Say you`re sorry, they`re looking at us.

636
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,149
l`m not afraid of you.

637
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:01,709
Say you`re sorry.

638
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:08,955
You`re an animal.

639
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,270
Doctor, I did what you told me.

640
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,029
I did what you told me.

641
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,558
But Owl`s wound is still bleeding.

642
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:13,949
Conchita...

643
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:18,949
Someone`s coming.

644
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,229
Someone`s coming, doctor!

645
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,475
Help me on my feet.

646
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,794
Jaime, put on the record.

647
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,108
Turn the horn towards the window.

648
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,389
Didn`t you say he was dead?

649
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,869
Bastard!

650
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,635
Nobody knows anything. We`re going to wait.

651
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,599
They`re leaving!

652
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,114
All my life l`ve always stopped short...

653
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,873
...left things unfinished.

654
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,549
l`m not going to leave you alone, I promise you.

655
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,394
I will never leave this place.

656
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,715
We`ll wait for you upstairs.

657
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,315
l`m not going to run away.

658
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:40,954
I want to talk to you.

659
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,829
Nothing.

660
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:54,789
They must have driven on.

661
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,710
Tell me, what do you want?

662
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,268
Jacinto.

663
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:32,435
Bring him to me.

664
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,469
I understand.

665
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,554
l`m going to help you.

666
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:45,349
Jaime! I saw Santi!
He told me what he wants!

667
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,633
I had to break the old man`s fingers.

668
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,269
Even dead, he`s stubborn.

669
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,953
Hurry up! Come on!

670
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,079
There`s something here!

671
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,188
Marcelo! Out of the way!

672
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:36,112
Fucking great.
It wasn`t a complete waste of time.

673
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,429
This is yours, isn`t it?

674
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:32,549
We have to get out of here.

675
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,392
One of us has to climb through the window.

676
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,315
And then open the door.

677
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,029
And what then?

678
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,189
What`s wrong?

679
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:51,949
You scared?

680
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:53,909
Yea, I am, asshole.

681
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:56,198
You`re not wounded, like Owl is.

682
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:59,230
You`re not bleeding, you`re not even hurt.

683
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,149
Santi is dead.

684
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,269
Jacinto killed him.

685
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,593
If we stay here, he`ll kill us all.

686
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,713
Do you want to sit and wait?

687
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,634
You think that he`ll let us go?

688
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,518
That it`ll all work out if we behave?

689
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,835
They have the rifle.

690
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,590
They`re bigger than us, and stronger.

691
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:33,948
Yes, but there`s more of us.

692
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:52,549
Wait!

693
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,115
Wait. Check if they`re still working.

694
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,148
Go on.

695
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,079
All right.

696
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:32,718
Galvez, did you hurt yourself?

697
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:36,069
A bit.

698
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:51,429
Fuck!

699
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,349
Look again!

700
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:58,476
There`s nothing here but souvenirs,
photographs! Just crap!

701
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:03,275
One of us has to go out and get Galvez.

702
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,189
Who`ll do it?

703
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,589
l`ll go.

704
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,959
No, not you. l`ll go, l`m skinnier.

705
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:29,269
Who opened it?

706
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,113
Dr. Casares opened the door.

707
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:54,191
He said l`d be all right,
and that we should be brave.

708
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,391
There`s no fucking gold here! You hear me?

709
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,429
You and your fancy ideas!

710
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,189
Fuck!

711
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,829
Gold, gold... My ass!

712
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,189
My father.

713
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,669
He was from Canada.

714
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:29,109
He was an accountant.

715
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:34,509
My mother was from Toledo.

716
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:37,749
And that`s me.

717
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:40,549
lt`s blurred, `cause I moved.

718
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,189
But that`s me.

719
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,073
We`re leaving tomorrow.

720
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:49,950
pig, do you think your brother in portugal
could put us up?

721
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,394
We don`t have much time.

722
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,828
``How lonely, the prince without a kingdom...

723
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:03,229
...the man without warmth.

724
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,756
Jacinto, 1925, in Malaga.``

725
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:17,589
I saw that gold.

726
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:19,469
lt`s here.

727
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:21,749
We just have to look for it.

728
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,472
We`ll find it, and tomorrow we`ll burn everything.

729
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:29,709
And the boys?

730
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:31,469
They`ve got no parents.

731
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,590
They`ve got no one. Who`ll miss them?

732
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,749
We`re at war.

733
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,118
A drop in the ocean.

734
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:47,429
Look, Jacinto.

735
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,389
Burn the place, kill the kids, I don`t give a shit.

736
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,432
But we`re getting out of here tomorrow.

737
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:13,552
-We need stuff from the car.
-Hurry up.

738
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:15,709
l`ll need a hand.

739
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,189
Come on, Pig.

740
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,758
You`re crazy, asshole!

741
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,759
Fuck you!

742
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:13,470
No, fuck you! lt`s all for me.

743
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:43,995
Son of a bitch!

744
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:40,275
What a joke!

745
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:57,314
Calvez, you go over there.

746
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,313
The rifle, Jaime, the rifle.

747
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:29,949
Santi...

748
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:11,434
What is a ghost?

749
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:16,275
A tragedy condemned to repeat itself
time and again?

750
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,831
A moment of pain, perhaps.

751
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,559
Something dead which still seems to be alive.

752
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,555
An emotion suspended in time.

753
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,553
Like a blurred photograph.

754
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,711
Like an insect trapped in amber.

755
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:16,469
A ghost.

756
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:19,309
That`s what I am.

757
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,836
TO MY PARENTS
