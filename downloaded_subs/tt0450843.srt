1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,200
How are you doing?

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
- Ready for this?
- Hell, yeah, we're ready for it!

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,040
You seem ready!

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,800
Well, okay!

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
SATAN

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Tonight, at Styxx Club,
we're going to start some shit!

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve,
but we don't give a fuck about holidays!

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
LORD, DO NOT FORGIVE THEM,
FOR THEY KNOW WHAT THEY DO

9
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Damn, Bart!
There's some bitches in tonight. Look!

10
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,720
The party's real fly! Lots of people tonight!

11
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,760
- No, it's not fly.
- Dope party!

12
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,800
- Where are the bottles?
- What bottles? We just ordered two of them!

13
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,560
- Nice shirt!
- Don't touch!

14
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,640
- Five minutes ago.
- Two bottles?

15
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,520
Didn't we ask for two bottles?
Five minutes ago?

16
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,440
It's our last night.
We want to bust out tonight!

17
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,920
- They should be here by now.
- I'll be back in five. Lf...

18
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,160
- What are you doing?
- Chill, homie!

19
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,800
- Sit down and shut the fuck up!
- Whatever!

20
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
- Yasmine, give me a vodka!
- Got money?

21
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
- No.
- Then no.

22
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
- Just one, for Christmas!
- I've been hooking you up all night!

23
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,160
Yasmine, not going to introduce me?

24
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,240
Sorry. Eve, a childhood friend.
Eve, this is Thaiii.

25
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yo, Ladj!

26
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,720
Last one!

27
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,320
- Ladj, Eve.
- What's up?

28
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
Eve, Ladj.

29
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Want to dance?

30
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,640
- What's up, Yasmine?
- Hi.

31
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,920
Want a drink?

32
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,120
- What?
- A drink?

33
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,560
I'm going to go change. Meet me outside.
I need fresh air.

34
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hope you dug it because
I got a fucking Christmas gift for you all!

35
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Barbarian bastards!

36
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,720
- Want to dance?
- I'm okay.

37
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,760
I didn't ask if you're okay.
I asked if you want to dance, bitch.

38
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,000
Your breath reeks!

39
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,680
- Got a phone number?
- No.

40
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,560
You think I'm going to buy that,
you ugly skank?

41
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,320
- Back off, moron!
- "Back off, moron."

42
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
- Back off!
- Are you crazy? That's enough!

43
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
- Stop it!
- Bring it on, asshole!

44
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What's your problem? Get off me!

45
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
- Get your hands off me, motherfucker!
- Be cool! Be cool!

46
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Out of the way! Get away! Move!

47
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
- I work with Byron.
- Since when?

48
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,440
What's going on?
Why are you pushing him?

49
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Got a problem?

50
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What's your problem?

51
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Easy. Easy. Go on, beat it.

52
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,760
- Bart, are you okay?
- Yeah.

53
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,720
- Is it bleeding a lot?
- A lot.

54
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,240
- Give me a handkerchief.
- Just a minute.

55
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There's a lot?

56
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,440
- What happened?
- Cocksucking bartender!

57
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
- Bart, you got your ass kicked?
- No, it was that guy...

58
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,320
- You started that mess.
- He busted a bottle in my face.

59
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,680
- Damn! He got you good!
- No big deal.

60
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,000
Come on, let's get out of here.
We're not going to stick around all night.

61
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,040
What do you mean? Are you crazy?

62
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,840
We're not going home, are we?
Girls, any ideas?

63
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,840
We can go to my place if you want,
in the country.

64
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,680
Got a ride?

65
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,600
They're assholes in that club!

66
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,520
They're assholes in that club!

67
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,280
Real pussies! He's a pussy!

68
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,240
Get out. Now.

69
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,320
- I'll beat your ass, you damn dog!
- Move it, Bart!

70
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,520
Move it. Move it.

71
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,680
- That dog reeks!
- Like his owner!

72
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,720
You think your shit don't stink?

73
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,360
- Damn, I'm low on gas.
- Go to lvry Garage.

74
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,000
- Who's got dough?
- I'm broke.

75
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
- Anyone got any aspirin?
- Sorry. Payday's next week.

76
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,320
- My head hurts.
- Fucking cheapskates.

77
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,800
Sorry. I'm broke, too.

78
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,880
Who cares? Let's gas and dash.

79
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,240
- I'm going to grab some food.
- Go on.

80
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What's gas and dash?

81
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
- Give me that.
- What are you doing with my scarf?

82
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,480
Boss.

83
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,040
Can you fill up number 4, please?

84
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,160
- There.
- Thanks.

85
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
When is Christmas?

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,720
- When is Christmas?
- It's tomorrow, asshole.

87
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,160
You don't even know what day it is?

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,680
About that chick, are you going to hit that?

89
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Don't worry. She's going to get it tonight.

90
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Wait. Wait!

91
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,720
Let's go.

92
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,440
Now.

93
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You little shits!

94
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What is it?

95
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Faggots!

96
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
- Take that side street!
- Slower! Slower! Slower!

97
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Put some music on.

98
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
- Want some candy?
- I want to go home!

99
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
- What about me?
- Have one, too!

100
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Go! Go!

101
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,440
Step on the gas! Fuck!

102
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,680
- Ladj! Ladj!
- Don't throw your candy on me!

103
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Tyson, you want a cookie?

104
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,600
Don't feed him that shit!

105
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Are you crazy or what?

106
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Wake up, Bart!

107
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Wake up, Bart!

108
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,000
Fuck, Bart!

109
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Wake up!

110
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
- What?
- We're there.

111
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
- What's going on?
- The goats are blocking the road.

112
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,880
Hit the gas! Who gives a fuck?

113
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't move. Stay there.

114
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,480
Stay.

115
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What the fuck?

116
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
- Where's your crib?
- Over there.

117
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
- Yasmine, I think I love you.
- Quit it.

118
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,320
- I dreamt about your tits.
- Dream on.

119
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,000
- I was about to kiss you, and I woke up.
- Drop it.

120
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,040
You're so cute.

121
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,080
- Can't we fool around a little?
- You're retarded.

122
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,720
Bart, check out that one.

123
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,840
Come here. Look at that face.

124
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Come here. Looks nasty.

125
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,880
Must have been in an accident.

126
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,280
I hold you
You hold me

127
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,240
By the goatee

128
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,640
The first one to grin

129
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,160
Gets a slap in the face

130
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,080
Motherfucking...

131
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Are you crazy?

132
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,440
What are you looking at? Dirty bitch!

133
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,320
- You, too! Get away!
- Have you lost your mind?

134
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,320
- Get away!
- Bart, got yourself in a fight again?

135
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
Come on. What?

136
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,800
I told you last time to call me
when you're in trouble, and you got beat up.

137
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,960
I'm here now. You won't get beat up again.
Go for it!

138
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,440
Which one smacked you?
Tell me which one.

139
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,240
- He wants a fight or something?
- I'm kidding.

140
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,200
I don't care.

141
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This is Joseph, the housekeeper.

142
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Hi.

143
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,920
- Hello.
- Hi.

144
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Hi.

145
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,600
Thaiii.

146
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,000
What's up?

147
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
- Marc.
- No, Bart.

148
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
- Marc.
- And Yasmine.

149
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,520
Hello.

150
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Little Turk. She's pretty.

151
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Big tits or what?

152
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
- That's Catherine.
- She's got milk?

153
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Best in the county. Famous everywhere.

154
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,440
- Who wants some?
- Me.

155
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
- Chink?
- No, thanks.

156
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
- Your turn.
- I don't like milk.

157
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,920
- There, Marc.
- Yo! What's up?

158
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,840
- What's your problem?
- What?

159
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,240
- What?
- It's a joke.

160
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,560
I'm not joking with you.

161
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,800
Come on, let's go!

162
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That guy's weird.
He looks like a dim-witted perv.

163
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What's a perv?

164
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You know, a pervert.

165
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You stay there.

166
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
- Hit the gas!
- Go, Bart! Bart, push!

167
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Forget about it.

168
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We're fucked. Boss, got a vehicle?

169
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
- Get in, Bart!
- Come on, open the door!

170
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
- Bart! Bart!
- Come on! Come on!

171
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
- Stop teasing me! Quit it!
- Bart!

172
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Stop playing around!

173
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Ladj, you're crazy. He chased a goat,

174
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,440
and he sucked the milk out of its udder.

175
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,080
Then he sheared its hair
to make some boots.

176
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Tyson, come here. Come.

177
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,640
Welcome.

178
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This crib is fly!

179
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You're a rich girl. What do your folks do?

180
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
My mum died giving birth to me,
and my dad hung himself.

181
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
- I'm sorry.
- I'm joking. Cheer up!

182
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,040
- What's this workshop?
- Hold on.

183
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
- Are your folks here?
- No, why?

184
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,800
No reason.

185
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,360
What's this workshop?

186
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,960
Dad owned a doll store. This is his stock.

187
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
- Dope couch!
- Want a tour?

188
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,920
- I ain't moving.
- Me, neither.

189
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,840
Got to rest.

190
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,480
- Coming, Yasmine?
- Sure.

191
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,840
Ladj, you're coming.

192
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,200
The toilet, my room, Joseph's rooms.

193
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,800
- He lives here?
- Sure. Let's go upstairs.

194
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,920
It's massive!

195
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,320
My parents' bedroom.

196
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,600
Coming?

197
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,000
- Nice bed.
- Come on.

198
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,520
- I saved the best for last.
- What is it?

199
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,800
You'll see.

200
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Dad's collection.

201
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,040
It's beautiful.

202
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,640
Come on.

203
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Bart, check it out.

204
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So your folks are gone for the evening?

205
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What's with the hand?

206
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Acting all coy, huh?

207
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,760
Look for trouble, and you're going to find it.

208
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,000
Eve. Eve, stop it.

209
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,320
Your parents aren't here,
so you want to be naughty, huh?

210
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,960
That's what happens
when you get me started.

211
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Take it like a big girl, like that.

212
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Not acting like a grown-up now?

213
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,920
Hello, ma'am.

214
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,600
- You saw someone?
- Yeah.

215
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
You stay here.

216
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Bart, check it out.

217
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,160
- Crazy blade, huh?
- Let me see it.

218
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,960
Don't touch! Leave it alone.

219
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
We saw a lady.

220
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's Marie, the housekeeper's wife.
She's pregnant. Be quiet.

221
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
- We were quiet.
- Want to see the greenhouse?

222
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Don't worry, baby.
It'll all be ready for your birth.

223
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Daddy's picking you some nice clothes
and beautiful eyes.

224
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
- That one's crazy.
- That's the slipper orchid. Come see.

225
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,480
Has to have pure water.

226
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,440
Brought you some milk.

227
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,600
Sir, I already told you. I don't like milk.

228
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,200
That's for reproduction.

229
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,560
The male insect works his way in there
and fertilises it.

230
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Wild!

231
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
- It's hot.
- It's from the hot spring.

232
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The hot spring's warm water
makes these plants grow so luscious.

233
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yo, Eve, Thaiii, want to go to the hot spring?

234
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,120
The two of us can go, if you want.

235
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
- Thaiii! Not just the two of us, sir.
- Why not?

236
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
We can swim there. I swear, it's very warm.

237
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,560
Trust me. That way, I can show you around.

238
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Come on. Let's go, buddy.

239
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,920
Eve, he's nuts. No sir, please.

240
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,920
- Later.
- But it's really warm!

241
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,160
No one's around. You can skinny dip.

242
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,640
We all do it, even me!

243
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Stop kissing ass!

244
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
- Lf not, I can lend you trunks.
- Bart!

245
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,600
Let go!

246
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,480
Fuck!

247
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,720
Look what you did!

248
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,800
Cut it out!

249
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Shut up!

250
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,640
Shut up!

251
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,080
Guys, come here.

252
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,560
Yasmine, hold him tight, or they'll fight.

253
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,480
Don't worry.

254
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,120
My girl's sweating me. Let's roll.

255
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,000
Who's the boss? She got you tamed?

256
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,920
- Nobody tames me.
- So shut up.

257
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So we're going to the hot spring?

258
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Get away from my car!

259
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
- This is Gilou.
- Hey, Gilou.

260
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Hey, Gilou.

261
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,880
Shall we go?

262
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,080
Bart, come here.

263
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,280
- Why are you cock blocking?
- What?

264
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,520
Don't act stupid.
I see what you're up to with Yasmine.

265
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:41,240
- You're nuts. I don't care about Yasmine.
- Hit on Eve, but leave Yasmine alone.

266
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,760
What?

267
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,760
- Who's that?
- You like her?

268
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,160
Want to fuck her?

269
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Jeanne! Come on over! Come here!

270
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,720
- This is Bork.
- It's Bart.

271
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,040
- Marc.
- Hey, Marc.

272
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,560
- No, Bart. Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Bart.

273
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,640
This is Jeanne.

274
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
What's that?

275
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,760
- You want to know everything, don't you?
- What were you saying?

276
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,720
You two getting acquainted?

277
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,880
- Going to the hot spring?
- Right.

278
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
- Like her?
- Sure.

279
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,040
She's my niece.

280
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,560
- See you there?
- Right.

281
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,680
- That's all you got for me?
- Come on, Bart.

282
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Bart!

283
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
What?

284
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,720
Watch it, motherfucker.
Are you fucking blind?

285
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Go, Gilou!

286
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Quit it! Fuck!

287
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
- It's warm.
- It is.

288
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
- Hurry. It's nice and hot.
- Like you.

289
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
- Come on.
- Damn!

290
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
- Coming in, Bart?
- I don't want to.

291
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,880
Where is he?

292
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Joseph!

293
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Dive under!

294
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,160
Something bit me!

295
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Little Turk.

296
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Did you get scared?
The little Turk got scared.

297
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,480
Gilou, come here a sec.

298
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,560
You want to take a hike?

299
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,040
Come here, you.

300
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I saved your life.

301
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
- Is it because of me?
- What?

302
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Titty hard-on.

303
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
- Stop.
- Stop what?

304
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,200
You don't like it?

305
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,440
Okay, enough, already!

306
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,280
What are you doing?

307
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Knock it off. Get off me.

308
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
What are you doing? Go over there!

309
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,160
Why are you touching him like that?

310
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,000
Stop! Stop!

311
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,840
Stop! Stop!

312
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,560
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

313
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,600
- You want to turn me on?
- You want to turn me on?

314
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,760
- Stop repeating.
- Stop repeating.

315
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,920
- Stop repeating.
- Stop repeating.

316
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,960
You're insane.

317
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,480
Easy.

318
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,480
Fuck!

319
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
- What are you doing?
- That's enough! Stop it! Stop it!

320
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Come on! Stop it! Fuck!

321
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
What's the matter? Want something?

322
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,160
- Are you talking to me?
- Who else?

323
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,960
What's up?

324
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,640
- Want to duel?
- I'm down.

325
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,440
Go for it.

326
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Bring it on.

327
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
- It's on!
- Yeah! It's on!

328
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
- Bart.
- What?

329
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,880
Come get it.

330
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
- Want to hop on my shoulders?
- What?

331
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,080
On my shoulders?

332
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,240
- Think I'm a fag?
- Come on, Bart!

333
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,120
- I'm not doing it.
- Come on!

334
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,840
Come on, Marc. Come on, Marc.

335
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,200
- Go on, Marc.
- No way. That's enough.

336
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,680
- Go, Bart! Go, Bart! Go, Bart!
- No, no.

337
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,600
Let's go. Hop on my shoulders.

338
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,520
Only if we switch teams after.

339
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Go! Go!

340
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,560
You cunt! Stop laughing!

341
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Are you crazy?
Stop laughing, you stupid cunt!

342
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Shut up, or I'll smack you, bitch!

343
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
- Chill out!
- What?

344
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,200
What, you want to be Rambo?
Don't tell me to chill out!

345
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,720
Get away!

346
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
- Look here, Barto.
- Leave me alone!

347
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,320
What the fuck am I supposed to do now?

348
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,120
- Careful, Ladj, you'll burn yourself.
- Don't worry.

349
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,880
Feel better?

350
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Bart. Bart!

351
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Get your dog out of here. Bart, get him out.

352
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
- Here.
- Thanks.

353
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
- Quit it!
- Isn't Bart cute?

354
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,040
Joseph's getting you dry clothes.

355
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
See, my darling?
You can come into this world,

356
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
just like I promised.

357
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,600
Your gift's almost ready.

358
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Daddy's taking care of everything.

359
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,320
Marie, the scissors.

360
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,920
Hey, Yasmine!

361
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,080
- Who wants an apple?
- No, thanks.

362
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,280
- Yasmine?
- What?

363
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,520
Give me a massage.

364
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,960
- Watch it!
- What? I just wanted a rub.

365
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,400
- Want to help me get some wood?
- Sure.

366
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,840
- Leave the lovebirds to it.
- Whatever.

367
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,760
- Two's enough.
- We need more.

368
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,000
Get the clean ones, at least. Those are dirty.
Not too many!

369
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,480
- One more.
- Forget it.

370
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,000
- Now we're good.
- Take that one off!

371
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
- Fuck!
- What?

372
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,040
- Bart!
- What?

373
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,480
There's a snake. Don't send him my way!

374
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,840
- There it is!
- What are you doing? Get it away from me!

375
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,200
- What do you want me to do?
- Get it away! Stop playing!

376
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,000
What the hell are you doing?

377
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,480
What's wrong with you?

378
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,960
It's a Tarasque. They're almost extinct.

379
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,320
- I didn't mean to...
- You want me to tread on you, too?

380
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,000
- I just panicked.
- Go.

381
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,200
- Is he nuts?
- Help me pick them up.

382
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Bart. Bart.

383
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
He disrespected you.
You're just going to sit there?

384
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
- He likes it.
- Really? You like being disrespected?

385
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Leave him alone.

386
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Next time, I'll mess him up.
Who does he think I am?

387
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
- A wimp.
- A wimp.

388
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,720
- You're not a wimp. Have a bite.
- No thanks.

389
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
- Want a bite?
- A bite of you.

390
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm crazy. No one fucks with me and my dog.

391
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Tyson, come here! Shut up, Tyson!

392
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
What's that? Take that! Tyson, help me!

393
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,040
You want me to tread on you, too?

394
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,000
Sorry, sir. I panicked. I'm a wimp.
Leave me alone!

395
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
- Surprise downstairs!
- Coming.

396
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,560
Why make me look stupid?

397
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,880
You wimped out because you're a wimp.

398
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,120
I didn't say shit
because I saw he was an animal lover.

399
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,880
You were shitting yourself.

400
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You broke my snake.

401
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,120
- Are you coming?
- Be right there.

402
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,000
Hello.

403
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Baby, how are you?

404
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,560
I was going to call you.

405
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
"Baby, I was going to call you."

406
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,160
- I'm on the phone.
- "I can't stop thinking of you."

407
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,240
- Don't act like a kid.
- Stop it.

408
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,000
- Who's the boss?
- Stop it.

409
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,520
Yeah.

410
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,600
We got held up.

411
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,840
Soon as my clothes are dry, I'm out.

412
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,600
What are you talking about?

413
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,240
- You heard me.
- It's on.

414
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,720
- What's on?
- It's on.

415
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,880
They act all easy, but they're dick teasers.
Teasers!

416
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,480
You say that because Ladj has got Yasmine,
and Eve's with me.

417
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,240
You're alone with your dog.
Looks like your only hope is Joseph.

418
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,720
Drop this Joseph shit!

419
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,880
Guys, Joseph brought us a present.

420
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,840
A young goat!

421
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
This food's making me feel sick.

422
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
- Your loss. It's tasty.
- Barto?

423
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,760
Delicious.

424
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,920
Joseph, you're the goat master!

425
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,080
Merry Christmas!

426
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,000
- Merry Christmas!
- Two and a three.

427
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Wake up, sweet baby

428
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Caresses and kisses

429
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It's Christmas Eve

430
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,440
In Heaven and on Earth

431
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Wake up, sweet baby

432
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Caresses and kisses

433
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,480
Tonight's Christmas Eve

434
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Encore! Encore! Encore!

435
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Check out Jo-Jo!

436
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,880
- Why isn't your wife eating with us?
- That slut's a ball-breaker!

437
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,280
Your folks don't celebrate Christmas?

438
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,800
- I'm Muslim.
- So am I.

439
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:38,000
Same here.
Tyson and I converted, but I still eat pork.

440
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,640
- You're Muslim, too?
- No.

441
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,280
- You don't believe in God?
- That's not it.

442
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:51,200
My grandma was tortured in 'Nam.
She was fucked by sodding priests.

443
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,120
Religion's bullshit. Bullshit.

444
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,600
- Do you believe in God?
- Of course not.

445
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,920
- Why do you think you're here?
- Why?

446
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,800
My dad banged my mum, and now I'm here.
So what?

447
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:09,000
That's not what I'm asking.
Why are you here next to me?

448
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Stop brainwashing him. Religion's bullshit.

449
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,480
- That's blasphemy. Have some respect.
- You're one to talk.

450
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,280
With a spliff in your mouth,
ready to gangbang?

451
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,680
Who are you to judge?

452
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,040
And you, serving booze
and shaking your ass for a living.

453
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,000
Working isn't in your religion?

454
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:37,600
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- I've been busting my balls for 20 years,

455
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,600
and I have nothing to show for it.
God doesn't give a fuck about me.

456
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,840
I don't give a shit
if He fucks His own mother, either!

457
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,440
Don't talk like that, or I'll fuck you up!

458
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,200
Shit-face, the Sheitan's eating your brain.
He pushes us to sin.

459
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,720
He's everywhere, so don't talk like that.

460
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,520
- Who's the Sheitan?
- Satan.

461
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,840
The nigger's right!

462
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,440
If there's one thing
you ought to be scared of, it's Satan.

463
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
There was once a guy just like you, fearless.

464
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Satan paid him a visit in his dreams
and asked him what he wanted to be.

465
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,600
The guy wanted to be invincible,
so Satan made him invincible.

466
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,800
Later that night,

467
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,480
well,

468
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
he climbed onto his sister
and fucked her like a pig!

469
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Real deep!

470
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
But the next morning,

471
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
he realised she had a bun in the oven.

472
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,720
Pregnant.

473
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,840
Satan came back and told him,

474
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
"The rugrat,
who will be born on Christmas Eve

475
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
"when the church bells ring 12 times,

476
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
"it's my child," Satan said.

477
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,560
He told the guy, "You'll give him a gift."

478
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,000
Satan tells him,

479
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,560
"The gift for the nipper

480
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
"has to be..."

481
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Look at the coon!

482
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,880
This shit makes me want to piss.
Where's the can?

483
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
The door at the end.

484
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,480
Fuck!

485
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
What's going on?

486
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,920
What is this?

487
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,560
What are you doing here?

488
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,480
What?

489
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,040
You got scared?

490
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,440
No.

491
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Fearless, huh?

492
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
What's the matter, Bart?
What are you doing?

493
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,760
Joseph's driving me nuts,
acting like a psycho.

494
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,600
I've been telling you since the beginning.
He likes you. Seal the deal with him.

495
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,720
I'm not kidding.

496
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Hold on. Come.

497
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,840
Come see. It's Eve's bedroom.

498
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,640
Come on, it's Eve's bedroom.

499
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
No!

500
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,920
Check it out.

501
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Bart, wake up!

502
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
What is it?

503
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,720
Oh, shit!

504
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Here's some pictures.

505
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Isn't that adorable?

506
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Her leotard with that camel toe.

507
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,200
Look at her mouth.

508
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,440
Look at her mouth.

509
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,320
I bet her pussy's real fresh.

510
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,560
With a nice mouth like that,
she's got to have a fresh pussy.

511
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,720
- I don't agree.
- What are you talking about?

512
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,240
That girl, last summer?

513
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,280
- The Indian one?
- Not that one.

514
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,480
The one from the tent next to ours.

515
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,080
- She was ugly!
- You mean she was banging!

516
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,320
She had perky tits and the best ass.

517
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,920
- But she wasn't giving any away.
- No way!

518
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,000
Four days on her case and nothing!

519
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,320
She would only jerk me off, like that.

520
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Finally, I'm like, "Heloise, we like
each other. Enough of this kid's stuff."

521
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,440
Know what she told me?

522
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,880
"Well, my folks are going out tonight."

523
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,680
That night,
we had the whole tent to ourselves.

524
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,000
Air mattress, ostrich down comforters.

525
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I brought some vodka mixes
and got her drunk.

526
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
She gets wild.

527
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I start unbuttoning her and going down.

528
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,760
She grabs my hand and says,
"I don't put out on the first night."

529
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I start to suck on her titties,
and then I spot it.

530
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
- What?
- Her panties.

531
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Fountain woman! Everything was drenched.
So I got suspicious.

532
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I pulled down her panties,
slowly spread her legs, and there it was,

533
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,720
a fucking cold-cut platter!

534
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,160
I've never seen anything like it.
Disgusting! A cockscomb!

535
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,360
Flesh hanging everywhere, dripping.

536
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,600
- And then...
- No!

537
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,680
I did my thing.

538
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,400
- That's why your breath stinks!
- It stinks?

539
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,200
Get out of here. What are you doing?

540
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,160
Thaiii! Bart!

541
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,600
Thaiii?

542
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,520
What's this?

543
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Are you upstairs? You here?

544
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,040
Bunch of jerks!

545
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
You guys are jerks.

546
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,600
- What did you do, Bart?
- I didn't do shit.

547
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,560
Who messed with my dad's dolls?

548
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,440
- It wasn't me. Word to Allah.
- It's not funny!

549
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,000
- Chill. Sit down.
- Bastards.

550
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
You think we want to play with dolls?

551
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
- We were just watching TV. Relax.
- Bastards.

552
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,440
- You cold?
- A little.

553
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,040
- Want some heat?
- Yeah.

554
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,280
- It's not working.
- It's all right.

555
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,240
- Where are you from?
- Algeria.

556
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,000
Algerian?

557
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,600
I never dated one before.

558
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,520
- You speak Arabic?
- A little.

559
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,280
Go ahead.

560
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
- Sounds like Chinese!
- Really?

561
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,480
Yeah.

562
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,600
- I really like you.
- Really? That's sweet.

563
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,320
Yo, Sheitan's video!

564
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,040
Think I'm cute?

565
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,760
Be honest.

566
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,280
- A little bit.
- A bit?

567
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,040
- Yeah, but...
- Just a bit?

568
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
- What?
- Nothing.

569
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,640
Kiss me.

570
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
- What?
- It's that...

571
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,640
You don't want to kiss me?

572
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,640
That shit's the bomb, bro!

573
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,880
This shit is wild!

574
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Sorry. Back in two seconds.

575
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,480
Baby!

576
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,600
I'll call you back later.

577
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
- Where do I sleep?
- My parents' bedroom.

578
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,720
- Be up in a sec.
- Me, too.

579
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,920
- Yasmine.
- What?

580
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,080
- Seen Joseph?
- Why, you miss him?

581
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,760
Wait up.

582
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,040
Let me have a piece of that, bro.

583
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,160
Stop jocking her.

584
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,120
What are you talking about?
She's the one jocking me.

585
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:11,120
If I'm sexier than you,
blame it on Mother Nature.

586
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,200
You're going to leave me hanging?

587
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,000
Drop it. She's feeling me.

588
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,560
Let me warm her up, then you get a bite,
just like we agreed.

589
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,160
I don't want to do that.

590
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,040
- Makes me look like a loser.
- You are a loser.

591
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
- Here, towel and bubble bath.
- Thanks.

592
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
- So?
- What?

593
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,760
What's up?

594
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I'm glad you're here.

595
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,640
Me, too.

596
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
See you later.

597
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,080
I miss you, too.

598
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,040
I don't know. They're barbarians.

599
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Forget about it. Yeah. Yeah.

600
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I love you very much.

601
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,040
You want to play with your dolls?

602
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,560
I'd rather play doctor.

603
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
You smell good.

604
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Can I unbutton that?

605
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,360
Let me unbutton that!

606
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,400
- You're a pain.
- Stop it, Bart.

607
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,760
- Give me your hand.
- It's a princess.

608
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,800
Here, my doll.

609
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,200
My favourite song.

610
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Knock it off!

611
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,400
You're ruining the vibe because you think
I messed up the dolls, is that it?

612
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
- Whatever.
- I see what you two are up to. I'm out.

613
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,600
You're making me nervous.

614
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,480
What?

615
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,480
What?

616
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,640
Quit it.

617
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,280
What are you doing?

618
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,440
Let's go to your room.

619
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,480
Ladj?

620
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Ladj, is that you?

621
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,480
Shit!

622
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
- Baby?
- Fuck!

623
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,120
Ladj, you're starting to piss me off
with that phone!

624
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,480
Whose voice is that?

625
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,880
Nothing. It's the TV.

626
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,560
At least put the light on!

627
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,600
Fuck. It's nothing. It's the TV.

628
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Baby? Hello?

629
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,480
Fuck.

630
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,840
Yasmine, come here. Hurry up.

631
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
What?

632
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Word to Allah,
Joseph was spying on Eve's room.

633
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,600
Go take a bath instead of talking nonsense.

634
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,800
What? Do I stink?

635
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,320
Like it in the dark?

636
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
- Real nice.
- Yeah, right.

637
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Get her out of there! Get her out!
Come here! Fuck!

638
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Yasmine! Come!

639
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Is it ready?

640
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,600
Almost.

641
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,640
Come on.

642
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,640
Only the eyes are missing.

643
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,080
Where's the boy?

644
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,000
In her bedroom.

645
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Joseph, he's moving.

646
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,160
It's almost time.

647
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,800
Let's roll.

648
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,880
- Jerks!
- What?

649
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,640
- It's that bastard.
- Who?

650
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,440
Your housekeeper. I saw him.

651
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,480
- Go in front.
- You go.

652
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,000
You've got the stick. Go.

653
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Come out of there!

654
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,640
Come on!

655
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,920
- Stop running!
- What was that?

656
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,560
The guy from the spring.

657
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,520
There.

658
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,600
I'm going to fuck you up!

659
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Hey, baby. You're here, baby?

660
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,480
Baby.

661
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,880
Little baby.

662
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,600
Damn it! Your cell phone!

663
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,520
Hello?

664
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,920
No reception!

665
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,600
I'm going to fuck you up!

666
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,680
- Either hide or come with me!
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

667
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:50,120
I'm going to fuck you up, motherfucker!

668
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,680
I'm going to stuff your mother!
I'm going to stuff your mother!

669
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,600
Get on!

670
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
- There they are!
- Just give up!

671
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
What's going on?

672
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,520
Hail Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is
with thee. Blessed art thou among women,

673
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:07,280
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus...

674
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Please, take care of the boy.

675
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,760
- What's going on?
- They played a prank on us.

676
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,720
Where's Bart?

677
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,760
They left.

678
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
What the hell?

679
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,280
What have you done?

680
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Where are you going?

681
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Why did you do that?

682
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,440
Why?

683
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,320
You want to blow it?

684
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:28,000
Stop, Joseph! Stop! Stop!

685
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Stop! Stop! You'll kill him! Let go of him!

686
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I'll be out front.

687
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,480
Fuck!

688
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,640
What the hell is going on?

689
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Come here, big dog.

690
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Leave him!

691
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Tyson! Get off of him! Tyson! Tyson!

692
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Get off of him!

693
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,760
Come here!

694
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,920
Where's Bart?

695
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Come back! Over here!

696
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,760
Come back!

697
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,760
Come back!

698
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,880
Where is he?

699
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Tyson. Tyson.

700
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Hurry, Bart! What are you doing?

701
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Get in the fucking car! Come on!

702

Tyson, what are you doing?

Don't move.

You're leaving him like this?

He deserved it.
The tough guy learnt his lesson.

Dangerous, especially with bottles.
It doesn't look too serious.

Okay. Don't open your eyes.
I'm pulling off the gauze.

740
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,520
There.

Get out of here!

You're dreaming, Bart.

It's just as good.

757
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
It's a dream.

758
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Calm down.

759
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,760
Joseph's driving me nuts,
acting like a psycho.

760
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,920
What's wrong?

761
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:51,000
The Sheitan is eating your brain.

762
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,800

I climbed on my sister
and fucked her like a pig!

764
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Why are you here next to me?

01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Sweet baby

766
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Open wide your pretty eyes

01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Your eyes, Barto.

768
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Shut up. Shut up.

769
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Let's sing and dance

770
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
It's Christmas Eve

771
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:55,000
