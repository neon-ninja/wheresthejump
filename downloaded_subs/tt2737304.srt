1
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,020
We have a place, a compound.

2
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,020
We have a community.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,930
It's safe here.

4
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,220
How many of you are there?

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,640
Are any of them children?

6
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,810
Because the fastest way
to get here is by the river,

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,640
and I don't think
you could make it with kids.

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,720
Listen to me.
I'm only gonna say this once.

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,390
We are going on the trip now.
It's going to be rough.

10
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,100
It's gonna feel like
it's going on for a long time,

11
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,060
so it's gonna be hard to stay alert.

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,100
It's gonna be even harder to be quiet,
but you have to do both.

13
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,970
You have to do every single thing I say
or we will not make it.

14
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,180
Understand?

15
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,640
Under no circumstance are you allowed
to take off your blindfold.

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,350
If I find that you have, I will hurt you.

17
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,970
Do you understand?

18
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,180
It's cold. We have blankets.

19
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,720
Boy, you have your dog.
Girl, you have your kitty.

20
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,640
This is just a place.
There's nothing more that we need from it.

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,520
Do you understand?

22
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,810
And no talking on the river.

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,720
You must listen as closely as you can.

24
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,560
If you hear something in the woods,
you tell me.

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,270
If you hear something in the water,
you tell me.

26
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,720
But you never, ever
take off your blindfold.

27
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,020
If you look, you will die.

28
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,560
Do you understand?

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,600
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,350
- Kitty.
- It's okay. It's okay.

31
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,020
Let's go.

32
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,470
Okay. Okay.

33
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,850
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

34
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,810
Ah.

35
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,720
Twenty-eight, 29, 30.
Okay, this way. It's fine.

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,270
Thirty-one, 32, 33.

37
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,720
Where is it? Where is it?

38
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,640
- Uh... asshole, I was listening to that.
- Yeah, so were the people down the street.

39
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,560
The store was packed.
This thing seems serious.

40
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Wow, you literally have no food.

41
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,720
- What... What thing?
- Are you serious?

42
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,600
- I'm serious.
- Turn on the news, dumb-dumb.

43
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,930
Dumb-dumb.

44
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,810
- What channel, dumb-dumb?
- Any one of them.

45
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,470
Airports and train stations
have shut down.

46
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Streets are crowded with people
escaping cities by car and on foot

47
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,140
as witnesses report
unexplained mass suicides.

48
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,140
First recorded in Romania,

49
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,560
there's now an alarming spread
of incidents into Europe and Siberia.

50
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,770
Estimated death toll
is in the tens of thousands.

51
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,640
...don't yet know what is causing
the mass suicides in Europe and Russia.

52
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,310
The eyewitness reports tell of people
exhibiting psychotic behavior.

53
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,970
Our sources are telling us

54
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,600
this does not appear to be
pathological or viral.

55
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,390
US authorities are advising the public
to remain calm.

56
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,860
There have been
no officially confirmed inst...

57
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,720
Well, it's in Russia, so...

58
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,720
Well, try telling that to the soccer moms
fighting over bottled water.

59
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,220
Speaking of which,
I just got off the phone with Mom.

60
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,640
How come I have to update her
about you all the time?

61
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,560
- Why do you have to talk about me?
- I'm not telling her about my life.

62
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,060
At three o'clock, I'm gonna go check out
an Arabian stud in Sausalito.

63
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,310
See, now that is a sentence
you don't hear every day.

64
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,270
- You wanna come?
- I can't. I've got my OB with Dr. Lapham.

65
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,810
- Lapham, when?
- Oh, my God.

66
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,850
Why does your voice get high
when it gets excited?

67
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,450
- How about I drive you?
- No, I'm fine.

68
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,680
I can go in. We can maybe see the baby.

69
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,350
Or I can cancel the appointment
and we can go and see a horse.

70
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,140
No. Fuck the horse.

71
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,180
Wow. Such venom.

72
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,520
What do you think?

73
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,220
I think I see
a whole bunch of people sitting together,

74
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,140
but they all feel incredibly lonely.

75
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,850
The loneliness is just incidental.

76
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,970
It's really about
people's inability to connect.

77
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,600
Inability to connect to what?

78
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,890
- Can you move?
- Malorie.

79
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,696
- I need you to move.
- We've been through this.

80
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,930
- Mm-hmm.
- That's not how it's gonna be for you.

81
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,720
It's different with a baby.
It's an immediate love affair.

82
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,786
- It's not gonna be that way for me.
- Yes, it will.

83
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,970
- No, ma'am.
- You should be afraid of being alone,

84
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,220
not of this.

85
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,020
And what we need to do is get you...

86
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,520
...out into the real world
with other people,

87
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,520
not stuck in this house all day.
You never leave.

88
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,890
Why should I leave?
I have you to get me groceries.

89
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,366
- You have to move.
- No, not moving.

90
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,560
- Yes, you do.
- Not moving.

91
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,270
- Why?
- Not moving. I love my house!

92
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,810
I know it took you a long time
to find a studio you loved,

93
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,310
and ever since Ryan left,
you've gotten a lot more work done.

94
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,890
But, so fine, so no more roommates.

95
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,060
Ryan was not a roommate.

96
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,850
Uh, it turns out he kind of was.

97
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,560
Anyway, can't raise a kid here.
Where would you even put her?

98
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,140
How do you know it's a she?

99
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,930
Wishful thinking, I guess.

100
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,470
Sorry, it's work.
I'll be there in a second.

101
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,850
Hi.

102
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,810
Yeah, they just had
to push the surgery back an hour.

103
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,890
Yes?

104
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,020
Yeah.

105
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,770
I'll call right back.

106
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,850
What?

107
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,470
You still don't wanna know the gender?

108
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,180
And ruin the surprise, Dr. Lapham? No.

109
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,850
How have you been feeling?
Have you been sleeping any better?

110
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:25,850
Rough.

111
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,680
I never slept well
before I had this condition.

112
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,140
It's called pregnancy.
It's okay to say it out loud.

113
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,810
Oh, don't you know, Doctor,
if you don't acknowledge a thing,

114
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,890
it simply goes away?

115
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,180
Oh, really? All this time, I had no idea.

116
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,116
- When a horse gets pregnant...
- God, the horse.

117
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,970
You know about horses? When a horse
gets pregnant, it knows right away.

118
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,930
Does it?

119
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,220
It changes the way it eats.
It changes its gait.

120
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,060
It bites all the other horses
who come too close.

121
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,520
It's too bad we're not horses.

122
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,810
It is too bad. Great to be a horse.
Then we would have, like, a mother

123
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,470
who would have actually raised us

124
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,430
and a father
off on some faraway stud farm.

125
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,930
Hold on.
Our father was off on a faraway stud farm.

126
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,560
- That is correct.
- That is correct.

127
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,770
Poor us.

128
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,390
We should go feel sorry for ourselves
with lunch and a bottle of wine.

129
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,600
Oh, finally,
now you're making some sense.

130
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,770
- Good.
- Really, in front of me?

131
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,850
We didn't mean it...

132
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,810
No, like a tiny glass of rosé
is not gonna hurt the little bean.

133
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,570
I'm pretty sure I heard the word "bottle."

134
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,800
You might want to think of a name
besides "little bean"

135
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,140
seeing as your child
is now the size of a small melon.

136
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,100
Small melon!

137
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,020
I know it's hard to love someone
you haven't met yet.

138
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,060
Oh, that's beautiful.

139
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,470
Thought about stitching that on,
like, a little lavender sachet?

140
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,196
- Could sell them in the gift shop.
- In the gift shop.

141
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,600
You're having a baby, Malorie.

142
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,720
Pretty soon you and I, Jessica,
and some hard-ass labor and delivery nurse

143
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,946
will be on the third floor
making the same wise cracks.

144
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,600
Only this time,
you won't be going home by yourself.

145
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,390
I know. I know.

146
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,640
But if that's not what you want,

147
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,520
there are plenty of couples
who are desperate to adopt a child.

148
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,770
There are no judgments here.
You can make whatever choice you want.

149
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,680
But what you can't do is ignore it
and hope it just goes away.

150
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,970
You okay in there?

151
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,140
I'm great.

152
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,220
Are you puking?

153
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,850
Just go to the car.

154
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,140
Is it chunky?

155
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,270
No, it was actually the really smooth kind
that just shoots out real clean.

156
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,140
I'll meet you at the car, okay?

157
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,810
- In the corridor.
- Let's get it clear.

158
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,520
Hey! Hey! Hey, security!

159
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,060
Watch out. Help. I need help!

160
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,520
No, get back!

161
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,350
- Calm down. Please calm down.
- Code gray. Level one.

162
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,270
Calm down. Security!

163
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,770
- You feel better?
- It's happening now.

164
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,720
You get any on you?

165
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,390
The thing in Russia that's making
everybody crazy, it's here now.

166
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,220
- What?
- Can you just, please...

167
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,970
- Hold on.
- Inside the hospital.

168
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,140
Go, go, go, go!

169
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,680
Go, go, go, go, go!

170
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,350
We're going straight to Santa Rosa.

171
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,970
You can stay at my place
until whatever the fuck this is isn't.

172
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,406
- I don't have any clothes.
- You can wear something of mine.

173
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,350
I'm not much of a chaps-and-boots gal.

174
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,310
You're worried about
what to wear right now?

175
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,600
Well, I find it comforting
to focus on the wrong things.

176
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,100
- Shit.
- What?

177
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,380
There's a car stopped in
the middle of the fucking road.

178
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,310
Stop. Just go round.

179
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,430
Move. Let me go.

180
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,850
If this thing gets any worse,
you'll wanna be off the roads

181
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,140
and on a damn horse, trust me.

182
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,520
- Oh, my God!
- Shit. Shit, shit, shit!

183
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,720
People have to stop being so stupid.

184
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,390
Oh, my God, Jess. Just go. Go.

185
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,366
I'm not running the light
with a pregnant lady in the car.

186
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,640
Just drive the car!

187
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,770
You gotta let me just drive.
You're freaking me out.

188
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,020
- You know what?
- Just let me do it.

189
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,270
- This isn't me.
- My phone is in the back seat.

190
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,190
- It's the foreman wondering where I am.
- Right, just hold your horses.

191
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,156
- Yeah, ha ha.
- What did you do with it?

192
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,270
Oh, my God. What the fuck is that?

193
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,656
What the fuck is what?

194
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,600
What the fuck is what?

195
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,730
What the fuck is what?
What are you looking at?

196
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,060
What did you see? Talk to me.
What the fuck is what?

197
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,560
What are you doing? Oh, my God, Jess.
Jess, don't do that.

198
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,430
Just what are you... What is wrong
with you? No. Stop it! Stop it!

199
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,020
No, no, no!

200
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Stop it! Stop it!

201
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,850
Jess, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Jess, please. Stop it, Jess.

202
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,180
God damn it! Stop it! Please stop it!

203
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,576
- Lydia, what are you doing?
- She's pregnant.

204
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,770
Lydia, not now. Let's go in.

205
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,100
She's pregnant.

206
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,220
You can't help!

207
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,350
Hurry, come inside!

208
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,430
Okay.

209
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,680
Sweetheart, get up. Right now.

210
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,350
Mom.

211
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,310
Please don't go.

212
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,140
Please don't go.

213
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,970
Hey. Hey. Hey.

214
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,850
Keep your eyes down.

215
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,270
Open the door.
This woman is pregnant.

216
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,310
- Open the door!
- No.

217
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,220
- Hey! Open the door. Police.
- Don't open it.

218
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,560
- Police! Open the fucking door!
- I'm sorry. It's my house.

219
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,600
Get in. Hurry!

220
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,680
Come on. You good?

221
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,770
Are you okay?

222
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,430
She went to help you.

223
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,850
Now she's gone.

224
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,390
Come on. Now everybody's
obviously just a little freaked out.

225
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,231
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Come in. Come inside the house.

226
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,850
Come on. Come on.

227
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,640
Is everybody all right?

228
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,560
Is anyone getting service in here?
You don't have any Wi-Fi?

229
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,810
I have not gotten any.

230
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,270
Come on.

231
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,656
- It's not working.
- I gotta get a hold of my kids.

232
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,270
No, nothing.

233
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,560
- Honey?
- Nothing. I have nothing.

234
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,140
- They're at home?
- Excuse me.

235
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,970
Mom? Mom, call me. Call me right now.

236
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,890
Something... Hello? Hello?

237
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,220
That thing fucks with your nervous system.
I've seen it in my clients for weeks.

238
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,350
Hey, did I mention I'm a fucking cop?

239
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,970
You're in the Academy.
Doesn't make you a cop.

240
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,680
Whatever it is,
I'm sure they'll send someone soon.

241
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,680
No, the only thing that will happen soon
is we're all gonna die soon.

242
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,770
This has a classic bio-warfare signature.

243
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,600
North Korea or Iran.

244
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,560
Douglas, that's it.
They don't know what it is yet, okay?

245
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,680
We just all gotta try to stay calm.

246
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,060
- Really?
- Yeah.

247
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,680
Please.

248
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,180
We are so fucking fucked.

249
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,270
I think I heard one.

250
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,310
We were running up the street,
and I swear to God, I... I felt something.

251
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,656
- I heard something.
- Did you see it? What was it?

252
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,470
I... I don't know. It was just there.

253
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,220
- The presence?
- Yeah.

254
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,020
So fucking fucked.

255
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,690
Gotta be an image out there.
They must have released some video.

256
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,430
- I haven't seen anything.
- My crew saw one.

257
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,390
- What?
- What?

258
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,020
One minute,
we were digging a foundation...

259
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,560
and then my contractor just lies down
in front of the bulldozer.

260
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,520
And then my operator tips the rig
into the ditch and snaps his own neck.

261
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,770
- Oh.
- It seems like if you look at it,

262
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,470
it makes you crazy
or it makes you wanna hurt yourself.

263
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,100
No, it makes you kill yourself.

264
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,680
And you just...
you just look at it.

265
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,560
- And you commit suicide.
- How can that be?

266
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,390
Close the windows. Get the windows!
Close all the windows.

267
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,310
Everybody, get the windows.

268
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,310
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

269
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,850
Andy, Bailey, can you hear me?

270
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,720
Dad? What's that thing outside?

271
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,640
- Bailey! Bailey?
- Bailey.

272
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Bailey! Bailey!

273
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,270
- If you go outside, you'll die.
- My children are out there!

274
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,640
- Move!
- You won't make it to your children!

275
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,020
- It's back on. Turn it up.
- The President has declared

276
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,390
a state of emergency
and has closed all borders.

277
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,560
Do not, do not go outside.

278
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,680
Avoid social media. Use radi...

279
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,520
What? What in the shit is happening?

280
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,720
- It's an end game, man.
- I'm sorry, what?

281
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,270
The end game. Humanity has been judged,
and we've been found wanting.

282
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,370
- Judged? By who?
- They go by different names.

283
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,520
You got world religion and mythology
that's full of mentions of demons

284
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,270
or spirit creatures.
People who've seen these creatures

285
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,890
almost always describe
their encounter as this...

286
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,220
as with an entity that takes on
a form of your worst fears or...

287
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,850
your deepest sadness
or your greatest loss.

288
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,850
Sounds like bullshit to me.
Religious talk.

289
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,140
It's not bullshit, okay?
It's real talk. It's facts.

290
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,810
They come in all different forms.

291
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:37,850
You got the Aka Manah, the Varios Daevas
from ancient Zoroastrian legend.

292
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,100
You've got the Surgat
from ancient Christian occult beliefs

293
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,180
that made pregnant women encounter
their unborn children as other creatures

294
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,720
such as lobsters or spiders.

295
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:51,310
You've got the Huli-jing from China.
You've got the Puca from Celtic mythology.

296
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,600
All different names, but the same thing.

297
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
And what's that?

298
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,770
The end of us.

299
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,640
Charlie, did you learn all of that
working at the supermarket?

300
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,930
- No, I've been studying it for years.
- In college?

301
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,390
Not college per se, but...

302
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,350
I mean the Internet. That's where you get
all your information from.

303
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,220
- I'm working on a novel, guys.
- Fuck's sake.

304
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,156
So we can't do anything
but wait here until we go crazy like him?

305
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,180
The army is bound
to get this under control.

306
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,060
We just have to wait.

307
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,270
Hey. Hey.
Why don't we sit back down?

308
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,100
No, no, no. I'm fine.
I'm... I'm just trying to make a call.

309
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,680
- Understood.
- I'm okay.

310
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,600
Understood. Understood. Um...

311
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,890
- The phones aren't working right now.
- Okay. Okay.

312
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,350
Listen, are you in any pain?

313
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,100
What? No. No.

314
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,020
- I feel like you may have a concussion.
- I am fine. I'm fine.

315
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,270
- Okay. Okay.
- I am fine.

316
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,850
Okay.

317
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,270
We were just driving.

318
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,890
And then she saw something.

319
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,770
I didn't see what it was,
but then she got this look on her face.

320
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,060
It's like she got...

321
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,430
She got so sad, and Jess does not get sad.

322
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,060
No.

323
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,270
She stepped out of the car
and ran into the street...

324
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,770
and she's not suicidal.

325
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,180
She would never do that.

326
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,220
But it was...

327
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,470
And then that woman...
that woman, she saw me,

328
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,180
and then she started talking
to her mom and I...

329
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,770
That woman was my wife.

330
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,180
- Her name was Lydia.
- Okay.

331
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,470
And she wasn't talking to her mother.
Her mother's been dead ten years.

332
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,930
Hello?

333
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,770
Hello, can anybody hear me? Hello?

334
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,560
Hello? Can anybody hear me? Hello.

335
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,850
Is anybody out there?
Hello, my name is Malorie.

336
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,890
I'm on the river. Is anybody out there?

337
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,680
Hello? Hello? Is anybody out there?

338
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,470
Can anybody hear me? Hello?

339
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,720
Malorie. Malorie.

340
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,560
Malorie.

341
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,220
It's been three days
since these, um, events unfolded.

342
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,720
Station's lines are down.

343
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,930
I can't get in touch with anyone.

344
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,680
We haven't heard anything
from any authorities...

345
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,020
but if you are listening,

346
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,020
from what I can gather,
as long as you stay indoors,

347
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,270
as long as you don't look
at those things...

348
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,520
you should be fine.

349
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,350
Do not go outside.

350
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,680
The moment I receive any more news,
I will be sure to update you.

351
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,850
My husband works in trusts and estates.
What kind of law do you practice?

352
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,810
- Bankruptcy.
- When he's not suing his neighbors.

353
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,100
Hey, how long's
our food gonna last?

354
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,600
Not much longer.

355
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,890
Because some of us
don't understand the concept of rationing.

356
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,220
Douglas, your house is behind this one.

357
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,140
When we finish this,
let's go for a food run.

358
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,600
We'd never make it back.
What you don't understand is...

359
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,060
- Hey, Tom...
- We can't let anyone in.

360
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,970
Okay, just calm down.

361
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,020
- Hello?
- Yes, hello.

362
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,770
- You're making a big mistake.
- Douglas.

363
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,680
- Yes, hello.
- Hello?

364
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,520
My name is Olympia.
I need help. Please.

365
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,850
- Don't open the goddamn...
- I'm gonna open the door.

366
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,930
Fuck!

367
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,430
Okay, one second.

368
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,100
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

369
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,220
Move.

370
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,140
Go ahead.

371
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,640
Go ahead.

372
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,930
Go get a...
Go get a blanket. Go get a blanket.

373
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,616
There should be two lamps
on either side of the door.

374
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,060
I'm gonna hand you a blanket and I want
you to drape it across the both of them.

375
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,220
- Okay.
- Okay?

376
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,020
I need you to block the view for me.

377
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,620
- Cover your eyes.
- So stupid.

378
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,770
Malorie, cover your eyes.

379
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,810
Here. Here. Okay.

380
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,680
Okay.

381
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,350
Let me know when you have it.

382
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,810
Tom, is this safe?

383
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,810
- Shut up.
- Hold on, please!

384
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,850
- Okay, it's all covered.
- Okay.

385
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,810
I got you. Come on.

386
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,890
Hold on. Hold on.

387
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,310
We're good.

388
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,640
- Malorie.
- Yeah.

389
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,270
- The gun, please.
- Yeah.

390
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,850
Yeah, before you kill someone with it
since you have no idea how it works.

391
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,350
It's okay.

392
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,600
How...

393
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,560
There are so many of you.

394
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,220
So are you, um...

395
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,850
Are... Are you pregnant?

396
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,100
Yeah. October 1st.

397
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:56,890
What about you?

398
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,600
Uh, end of, uh, September.

399
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,430
Wait. Hold on. Is shit
still going crazy out there or what?

400
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,770
Are you on your own?

401
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,350
Yeah, I am.

402
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,850
My husband was deployed last month
'cause he's in the Air Force.

403
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,560
I tried to make stuff last
as long as I could, um...

404
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,470
but I was so hungry
and I was afraid I would starve my baby,

405
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,890
so I didn't know what to do.

406
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,430
- Have some water.
- Thank you.

407
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,020
So you left and started knocking
on random doors?

408
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,720
I only live a block away.

409
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:29,020
Great, now we can all starve
here in the maternity ward.

410
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,520
It just means we need
to get more supplies.

411
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,970
Of course, but we can't get anything
if we can't see.

412
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,720
Oh, we're so fucking trapped.

413
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,310
Maybe not.

414
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,390
Maybe we can see better than we thought.

415
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,430
- What do you mean?
- Come here.

416
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,100
We have cameras around the house
transmitting a live feed.

417
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,270
Come upstairs. Come on.

418
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,810
It's a digitized signal.

419
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,470
It just shows the color temperatures
of the objects. It's neutered information.

420
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,220
- Colors on a flat screen.
- But an image can still have power.

421
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,270
We have no idea
how these things can operate.

422
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,890
These images are not direct.

423
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,100
We can't look at whatever it is
with the naked eye,

424
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,310
but maybe we can with a translator.

425
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,180
Pixels and heat.

426
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,390
Maybe it won't even show up.

427
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,470
Well, we're not gonna find out
until one of us takes a look.

428
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,220
I think it's a huge mistake.

429
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,100
You would, Douglas.
You think everything is a huge mistake.

430
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,640
Sooner or later
we're gonna have to do something.

431
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,850
We don't know how long
we're gonna have electricity.

432
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,720
You gotta trust me on this.
I really think this is gonna work.

433
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,060
Okay. Okay.

434
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,180
Maybe if it does, we could use
the technology for supply runs or...

435
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,180
Exactly.

436
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,850
Just not too tight.

437
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,640
I hope you know what you're doing.

438
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,430
Listen... you and your husband,
you're good people.

439
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,890
You know, it wasn't... It wasn't that.

440
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,140
Thank you, Douglas.

441
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,310
You don't have to do this.

442
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,810
I know. Don't worry.

443
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,600
- Tom, I need the remote.
- Yeah.

444
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,850
There you go, bud.

445
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,600
So why are you suing him?

446
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,786
'Cause they want to tear down
this part of their house

447
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,020
and build some glass monstrosity.

448
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,770
His husband's an architect.

449
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,350
It's his property.
Why do you care what he builds?

450
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,350
Because I have to look at it.

451
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,020
Not a chance.

452
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,270
Well, the world's ending, baby,
so you never know.

453
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,600
Hmm.

454
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,470
Where are you, motherfucker?

455
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,270
Come on, Greg.

456
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,470
Focus.

457
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,390
It's, uh...
It's about the end of the world.

458
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,390
My novel.

459
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,600
But it's not one of those kids' stories
where they all got crossbows

460
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,970
and they're killing each other to survive
or running around some giant maze.

461
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,600
- Mm-hmm.
- No, this story is, um...

462
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,770
This story's gonna be real.

463
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,060
Did you ever think
it was gonna be anything like this?

464
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,390
Greg! Greg, can we come in?

465
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,890
- What's going on?
- Greg!

466
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,640
Greg, can we come in?

467
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,430
Look away!

468
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,720
Cover your eyes!
Cover your eyes. Find the monitor.

469
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,310
- Greg.
- Greg.

470
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,770
- Come on, Greg.
- Greg?

471
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,060
- Shit.
- I've got it here.

472
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,560
Okay! Okay! Okay!
You can open your eyes. You can see.

473
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,640
I fucking told him that it was a mistake.

474
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,350
Come on.
We got to move. We got to move.

475
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:06,810
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Come on. We gotta go.

476
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,310
We're never getting out of here.

477
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,930
No one's coming for us.

478
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,890
No one's coming for...

479
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,930
We need to go.

480
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,640
Hi.

481
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,020
Hi.

482
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,310
Yeah.

483
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,350
I thought it might be good for us
to be close considering...

484
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,270
Sure.

485
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,220
You know,
this way, we won't be lonely.

486
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:08,140
I read this blog post once
about how pregnant women

487
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,020
should always sleep next to someone

488
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,770
because the baby can sense
when the mother is lonely.

489
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,470
Perfect.

490
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,390
So, um...
have you thought about names yet?

491
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,100
No, not yet.

492
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,350
How about you?

493
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,060
Well, if it's a girl we wanted
to name her, like, Ariel or Jasmine.

494
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,350
I mean, I would love to name her
Cinderella and just call her Ella.

495
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,520
And what did your husband like?

496
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,310
He loves everything I love.

497
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,520
What about you?
Does your husband have a favorite?

498
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,560
Oh, it's just me.

499
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,140
- Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

500
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,970
Well, what about your family?
They must be excited...

501
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,520
Do you know what?
Could you just excuse me for one second?

502
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,640
I'll be right back.

503
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
Sorry.

504
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,470
That's something you can't unsee.

505
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,020
Ah, no. No, you cannot.

506
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,220
Yeah.

507
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,350
Sorry.

508
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,430
Shh.

509
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,600
- Shh, shh.
- Hmm.

510
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,640
Are you okay?

511
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,180
Yeah.

512
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,390
I'll wait to do my laundry in the morning.

513
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,600
- That's probably a good idea.
- Yeah, I think so.

514
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,810
Good night.

515
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,310
Hello!

516
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,270
You guys need some help?

517
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,270
- It's okay to take your blindfolds off.
- Do not take your blindfolds off. Do not!

518
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,720
I got some food.
Those kids look hungry.

519
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,220
Get down! Get down! Get down!
Down. Down. Down.

520
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,310
Hey, little buddies.

521
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,140
Have you ever seen a baby deer?

522
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,720
I'll tell you a secret.

523
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,220
I found one in the woods.

524
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,100
Okay. I know you're scared.
Well, listen, there's no need.

525
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,350
I'm not here to hurt you.
I can pull you to shore.

526
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,890
Take your goddamn blindfold off!

527
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,180
Ah!

528
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,680
I've seen one. I've seen the truth.

529
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,850
Take your blindfold off.

530
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,060
It's beautiful. It's beautiful.
Take your blindfold off.

531
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,560
Take your blindfold off!

532
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,350
It shall cleanse the world!

533
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,640
Everyone must look.

534
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,220
Everyone must look.

535
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,020
Got some bad news.

536
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,470
All right. We're running out of food
and there's no help coming.

537
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,220
We've got to get outside.

538
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,470
Look, I might know where we can get more.

539
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,470
- Where, Charlie?
- The Fields market.

540
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,140
I locked the place up
when everything started going crazy.

541
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,680
- You're just telling us this?
- At least we know now. Thank you.

542
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,270
Okay, so we'll need a group of us to go.

543
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,140
Whoa. We'll be dead before we get there.

544
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,850
- Are you kidding me?
- I'll go.

545
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,180
- Well, if he's going, I'm going.
- You're pregnant!

546
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,770
Well, if all you guys are going,
then I can come too.

547
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:51,270
Why don't I go on the first run
and then you can go on the second run?

548
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,640
- I'll come.
- What?

549
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,001
- It's a death wish.
- I have the training. It'll be fine.

550
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,890
I don't like this.
I don't think anyone should go.

551
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,446
- There are four of us.
- Five. Charlie's going.

552
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,770
Charlie's going?
Charlie ain't going nowhere.

553
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,220
- You know the security system.
- No chance I'm going.

554
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,270
I gave you the information.
That's all you needed.

555
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,850
You don't need me to tell you
where to go. It is a supermarket.

556
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,020
They got signs.
You've been shopping before.

557
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,020
You wanna get cereal,
the sign will say cereals.

558
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,970
If you can't read, I get it,
but you can read.

559
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,810
- No. You don't need me to go with you...
- Charlie. It'll be research for the book.

560
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,850
Okay? Be awesome.

561
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,640
All right, so the idea is if we
can black out all the windows,

562
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,270
it's efficient and it's safe.

563
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,890
Is anybody else hearing this?

564
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,100
How is driving blind safer?

565
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,100
We're not.

566
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,470
We've got the GPS.

567
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,310
Calculating route.

568
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,520
Continue straight.

569
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,640
In half a mile,
turn right onto Bay Street.

570
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,520
- What is that?
- It's a curb.

571
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,810
It's just a curb.

572
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,060
It's a proximity sensor.

573
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:05,020
Just a speed bump. It's just a speed bump.

574
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,890
Turn right here.

575
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,770
- Are we off the road?
- No, there's something.

576
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:34,220
- I think it must be just a truck.
- Just go around.

577
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,270
- Keep going around it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

578
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,970
What was that?

579
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,060
Is somebody else driving out there?

580
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,220
- Charlie, breathe.
- Shit! Fuck this shit.

581
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,220
- Get the fuck out!
- Charlie! Calm down.

582
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,310
Guys, stop touching him.

583
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,930
- Look at me. You have to be quiet.
- Shut him up.

584
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,470
Ah. Ah!

585
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,930
Fuck! We're not gonna make it.

586
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:31,060
Calm down. Calm down.

587
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,350
- Oh, shit!
- Everybody, hold on.

588
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,470
Hold on to something. Gonna move!

589
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,930
Ah!

590
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:39,970
Hold on!

591
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,520
That's not a fucking speed bump!

592
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,560
- Fuck, it's stuck.
- Hold on.

593
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,350
- Turn left here.
- Slow down! Slow down!

594
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,720
You have arrived.

595
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,270
What the fuck?

596
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,810
And after all this,
we're supposed to get out now?

597
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
Lucky us.

598
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,996
- On three. One...
- I'm ready now.

599
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,350
...two, three.

600
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,390
What was that?
What did I just hit?

601
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,890
That's just a pillar.

602
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,930
Okay. Where's the...

603
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,850
The door should be
just a couple of paces up, man.

604
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,746
- I'm lost.
- Towards your left.

605
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,310
Left. Left. I'm lost.

606
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,560
- Come on, you guys.
- I'm lost.

607
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,020
- Oh, here. Here.
- Okay. Okay.

608
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,270
- You're in?
- No.

609
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,720
Okay. Wait. Almost got it.

610
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,270
Okay, I got it.

611
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,220
Go on.

612
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,560
All right. We're in.

613
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,640
- Hello!
- Shh! Shh!

614
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,520
I'll check the windows.

615
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,970
Here we go. Here we go.

616
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,850
All right, I think we're clear.
You can take 'em off.

617
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:16,890
Oh, my God.

618
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,680
- Jack-fucking-pot.
- Yeah.

619
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,770
- Where are the canned goods?
- Aisle two.

620
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,180
- Toilet paper?
- Five.

621
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,680
- Fuck that. Where's the booze?
- It's in seven.

622
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:30,770
Let's not forget. We have limited space.
Stick to non-perishables, the necessities.

623
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,640
- Where are the electronics?
- Go to six.

624
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,470
Six. All right. Cool. Thank you.

625
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,560
I'm not cleaning this shit up.

626
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,520
Sweet.

627
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,310
Boy, I'm glad I tagged along.

628
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:53,180
This is truly the happiest place on Earth.

629
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,350
I know. You're not kidding!

630
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:04,970
It's, uh... my baby shower gift to you.

631
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,720
Why, thank you.

632
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,020
Yeah.

633
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,220
So, my sister is
expecting her fourth, so...

634
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,270
Oh, my God. She's a saint.

635
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:16,560
Yeah, she is.

636
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,720
And I'm always touching her belly.

637
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,020
It's calming.

638
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,770
Yeah, it's nature's dirty little trick.

639
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:30,470
Is your sister in Sacramento?

640
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,640
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

641
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,720
Yeah.

642
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:42,770
What about you? Where did you...
Where did you grow up?

643
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,350
Oh, just outside of Stockton.

644
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:45,930
- Stockton.
- Yeah.

645
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,060
- We raised horses.
- On a real ranch?

646
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,520
- Well, my daddy was a real cowboy.
- That's... That's how you learned your...

647
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,060
- What?
- ...little shotgun trick.

648
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,390
Yeah. I had an interesting childhood.

649
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:57,470
Hmm.

650
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,430
Ah, but Stockton wasn't
all that far from Sacramento.

651
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,770
No. Just down 99.

652
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,220
- Just down Highway 99.
- Worlds apart, right?

653
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,140
Still we could've met some other way.

654
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,390
Sure.

655
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,140
Could have been your babysitter.

656
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,060
My hot babysitter.

657
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:26,060
You're... You're only saying that
'cause we're all gonna die.

658
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:28,810
Possibly.

659
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:08,100
How did you guys get so lucky?

660
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:10,520
Huh?

661
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,060
Hi.

662
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,390
Hi, there.

663
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,470
So sleepy.

664
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,520
Attention, all shoppers,
come to aisle seven, please.

665
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,560
I have a big, big, big, big, big
announcement to make.

666
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,560
- Ladies and gentlemen, please...
- Yes, Douglas.

667
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:40,850
I would like to take this opportunity
to make a toast to all of us...

668
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:48,270
because all of us, collectively,
are making the end of the world...

669
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,060
great again! Yeah!

670
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,720
Birdies.

671
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,890
I mean, don't you doofuses get it?

672
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,970
Uh, we could just stay here.

673
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:14,270
We have a year's supply
of food and drink right here.

674
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,680
We don't ever have to pay
and we shouldn't ever leave.

675
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,970
And what are they gonna
do at Greg's? Starve?

676
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,350
Better them than us.

677
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:27,720
We have everything we need to live here.
Everything.

678
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:34,100
There is no statistical, logical, or legal
argument for trying to get back there.

679
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:37,310
Here's an argument: we're not assholes.

680
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,850
And we're not staying.

681
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,100
What is it?

682
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:59,180
- Somebody let me out of here.
- Charlie, what's behind there?

683
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,430
It's a loading dock.

684
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,060
Hello?

685
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:05,270
Please let me in.

686
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:07,930
Speak up, I can't hear you.

687
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,890
Please let me in.

688
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,640
Cover your eyes.

689
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,406
- What?
- I'm gonna open the door.

690
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,560
- No.
- There's a person out there.

691
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,270
I have to open the door.

692
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,100
Okay.

693
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,310
Okay. Uh...

694
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:25,970
Okay.

695
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:30,890
- Hello?
- Hello.

696
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,810
Please let me in. I'm trapped.

697
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,640
Wait, wait, wait. Is that...
Fish Fingers, is that you?

698
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,970
- Charlie, yeah, it's me.
- Who's Fish Fingers, Charlie?

699
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,076
He works here at the supermarket with me.
He works in the seafood department.

700
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,470
He's been to prison and he's a bit crazy,
but he's always nice to me.

701
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,850
- How did you get there, man?
- I got... I got...

702
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:50,600
They tricked me!

703
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,680
Who's they?

704
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,720
Who you talking about?
Are you there alone?

705
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:55,770
They tricked me
and they left me to rot here.

706
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:57,890
Who left you to rot?
What are you talking about?

707
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,020
You guys,
there's something wrong.

708
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,390
There's something wrong!

709
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:04,390
- Please let me in. I'm trapped.
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

710
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,770
What are you doin', Fish Fingers?
What are you doing, man?

711
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,930
Look at it!
It wants you to see it! Let me in!

712
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,100
He's too strong. I can't hold him.

713
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,520
Let me in!

714
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,930
Shit!

715
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:23,640
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

716
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,020
Fuck! Ah!

717
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,430
Charlie, wait!

718
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,100
Look at it, Charlie. It's beautiful.

719
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,020
- Charlie?
- Charlie!

720
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,810
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

721
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:39,810
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, fuck.

722
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,060
Fuck!

723
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,310
We gotta go.

724
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:51,680
We gotta move. Come on. Let's go.

725
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:52,970
Let's get out of here.

726
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:59,970
Please. Please let me in.

727
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,060
How is that guy alive in there?

728
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,350
Please let me in.

729
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:29,600
Hi, Felix!

730
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:33,180
Oh, my God. Look at all this stuff.

731
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:36,100
- Birdies?
- Yeah, they, uh...

732
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,680
They seem to sense
when the creatures are around.

733
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:40,640
Where's Charlie?

734
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,310
Another novel I won't have to read.

735
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:47,810
He saved us, you fucking asshole.

736
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:12,220
I know what you think of me,
what everybody thinks of me.

737
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:14,220
You know, in the divorce petition...

738
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:20,640
my first wife said that to call me a creep
would be an affront to creeps everywhere.

739
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:25,310
My second wife said
she no longer feared going to hell,

740
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:28,430
'cause it couldn't possibly be worse
than being married to me.

741
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,600
Think I would have loved them.

742
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,680
Maybe.

743
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,220
And then Lydia.

744
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:37,100
Third time really was the charm for me.

745
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,890
She was the kindest person I ever met.

746
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,390
But I'm here and she's gone.
You know why that is?

747
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:47,060
Because, in the end,
there are only two types of people.

748
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,140
The assholes and the dead.

749
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,430
God, you sound like my father.

750
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,270
Like your father? Why?

751
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:58,600
Was he a towering intellect given
to dispensing wisdom to undeserving fools?

752
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,520
Yes, he was fluent in asshole as well.

753
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:06,470
And just like you, he blamed
everything he did on some deeper meaning,

754
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,140
convoluted conspiracy theories and...

755
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,060
how it was everybody else's fault
when he was clearly in the wrong.

756
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,470
But, you know, once my sister and I
realized it was just an excuse

757
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,270
to treat his family like shit,
it made life a little easier.

758
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:23,310
You know what though?
I see one difference between us.

759
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,520
Hmm?

760
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,600
I'm never wrong.

761
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,310
You are...

762
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:29,810
You're two pricks in a pod.

763
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:32,350
Do I look like him as well?

764
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,180
Mm...

765
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,180
Not really.

766
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:40,470
- He wasn't exquisitely handsome?
- It's not that, it's just...

767
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:44,470
the hair... the hair is different.

768
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,930
- The hair?
- Yeah.

769
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,060
He had some.

770
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,640
Oh.

771
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:00,060
Oh, I can't.

772
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,890
Oh, come on, the world is ending.

773
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:06,890
I really don't think a quarter-ounce
of whiskey's gonna tip the scales, do you?

774
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:11,390
Well...

775
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:13,850
I hope you're wrong.

776
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:16,720
About the assholes and the dead.

777
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,390
I hope there is more.

778
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,390
Here's to hoping there is more.

779
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:49,220
- Close the garage.
- I've got it.

780
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,100
Wait. Wait. Wait.

781
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,810
- Cover your eyes.
- Yeah.

782
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,560
Okay, okay, okay.
It's closed. It's closed.

783
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,470
Sons of bitches.

784
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:02,270
Where's the goddamn car?

785
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:04,470
You guys.
You guys, where are Lucy and Felix?

786
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:14,390
Fuck.

787
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:44,600
You stopped rowing.

788
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,810
I'm just taking a break.

789
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,600
How much longer?

790
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,720
A few hours.

791
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:11,970
Ah!

792
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,890
Malorie!

793
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:20,350
Malorie! Malorie!

794
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:21,560
Help!

795
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,060
Malorie!

796
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,810
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- Yes.

797
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,350
- I'm cold.
- I know. I know you're cold. Hold on.

798
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:42,310
No, no, no, no, no, no.
All the food and blankets. God damn it!

799
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:45,140
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's...

800
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:46,220
Hold on.

801
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:48,810
Okay. All right.

802
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:51,350
- Okay.
- I'm so cold.

803
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:55,100
We're gonna get you warmed up, okay?
We're gonna get you warmed up.

804
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:59,020
Put this around you.

805
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,060
Keep your blindfolds on. Stay tight.

806
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,600
Did you hear that?

807
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,680
Did you hear that?

808
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,060
Lay down on the bottom of the boat.
Lay down, really flat.

809
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,560
I need you to be quiet.
I'm gonna leave the birds with you.

810
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,600
I'm gonna cover you up, but do not
make a sound and do not leave this boat.

811
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,100
Understand? Do not leave this boat!

812
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,640
Shit.

813
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,430
Malorie.

814
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,270
Malorie.

815
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:57,680
Malorie.

816
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:09,850
Something is wrong with Malorie.

817
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:12,180
Malorie.

818
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:13,350
Ah! Ah!

819
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:47,850
Malorie?

820
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,600
Malorie?

821
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,310
Malorie?

822
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:09,930
I told you to stay on the boat.

823
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,060
You don't think.

824
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,520
You do exactly what I say or you die,
do you understand me?

825
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,270
If something happens to me,
do not try and help me.

826
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:18,180
Forget about me and try to save yourself.

827
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:19,640
Do you understand?

828
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,850
Say it! If something happens to me,
what do you do?

829
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:25,310
You save yourself. Say it!

830
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:27,930
- I save myself.
- You save yourself.

831
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:31,100
I can't trust you.

832
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,850
The end of the world makes us do things.

833
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,850
- It's not the end of the world.
- Really?

834
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,810
It sure feels like it.

835
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:08,270
At the end of my deployment in Iraq,
we were stationed at this village...

836
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,520
ordered to patrol the streets,
make sure everybody was safe.

837
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:16,970
One morning, we saw...

838
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:21,020
this father walking with his four kids.

839
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,470
So I pulled over to make sure
everything was okay

840
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,180
and to make sure he got
wherever he was going safely.

841
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,350
Come to find out,
he was walking his kids to school.

842
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,180
In the middle of all that shit,

843
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:39,270
all that chaos,
he was walking his kids to school.

844
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:47,350
So...

845
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:52,220
So we just followed him.

846
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:54,850
Day after day.

847
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:56,520
We escorted him.

848
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:01,430
That just became our routine.

849
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:06,520
And then, at the end of our time,

850
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,270
he gave me this
when it was time to come back home.

851
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:17,770
Mm.

852
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:26,520
I like to think he's still
walking his kids to school.

853
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:09,470
Hello, can anybody hear me? Hello?

854
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,140
This is Malorie.
Anybody, can you hear me? Hello?

855
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:18,600
Can anybody hear me? Hello?
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

856
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:22,850
Hello? Testing, hello?

857
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,180
Hello, is anyone out there? Hello?

858
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,140
Can you hear me, please?

859
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:32,220
- Hello? Testing.
- Are you a...

860
01:05:32,310 --> 01:05:33,720
Do you have a blindfold on?

861
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:37,640
You do.
Is... Is the blanket behind you still up?

862
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,810
Ah...

863
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:42,270
Okay, just come in really, really quickly.

864
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:45,810
Thank you. Here's my blindfold.
Thank you so much.

865
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:49,390
It's okay. Just wait. Wait here. Malorie!

866
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:51,230
- I gotta pee.
- Olympia, what are you doing?

867
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:52,560
- Malorie!
- What are you doing?

868
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,430
- What are you thinking? Get down!
- Okay, he's just scared.

869
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,470
- He's just scared.
- Tom. Check the bag.

870
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:01,060
Get over here, Olympia. Get over here.

871
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:02,770
- Who are you?
- Who is this guy?

872
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:05,100
Tom, I've got him. Check the bag.
Check the bag.

873
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,060
- Who is this?
- He's just scared.

874
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:08,656
- Who are you?
- How did he get in here?

875
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,220
- Shut up, Olympia. Who are you?
- He was scared, okay? I just let him in.

876
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:14,680
- You let a stranger in the house!
- I'm sorry.

877
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,430
- He was terrified!
- Are you a simpleton?

878
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:18,970
Oh, God. Okay. Please.

879
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,430
My name is Gary.

880
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,430
I live in the city.

881
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:25,691
When these things came, I got
the first train out with some colleagues

882
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:27,270
because we thought it would be safe.

883
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:34,060
Please, please just let me stay here.
They're after me.

884
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,890
Who's after you?

885
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,600
- I don't believe it. He's lying.
- Who's after you?

886
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:39,810
It's obvious he's lying.

887
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:41,390
- I swear.
- Why are you here?

888
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:45,430
We went
to my colleague Carl's house to lay low.

889
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:49,270
Everything was fine until they broke in.

890
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,350
Creatures don't break into people's homes.

891
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:54,520
No, not the creatures, these psychos.

892
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:58,350
These psychos from Northwood.

893
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:00,850
Northwood?
I don't... Where is that?

894
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:03,640
It's a mental institution
for the criminally insane.

895
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,930
Well, it's nice to know
they have hall passes now.

896
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,600
And then what?

897
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:13,020
They took us outside
and they forced our eyes open

898
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,470
so that we would have
to look at the creatures.

899
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,060
What?

900
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:21,060
- Did you look?
- No.

901
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:26,930
Somehow, my friend Carl managed to tackle
one of these people to the ground

902
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:29,140
and the rest of us made a run for it.

903
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,640
I just kept on running
and running and running till I got here.

904
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:37,390
I've been knocking on
all the doors and nobody answered.

905
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:40,770
Until you did, so...

906
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:43,810
Thank you.

907
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:55,470
Birds.

908
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:01,640
The scariest thing was, uh...
when these people broke in, they...

909
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:05,850
they weren't wearing blindfolds.

910
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,100
It's like they didn't need them.

911
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:11,680
But they'd been outside.
You have to wear blindfolds.

912
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:12,770
Not these people.

913
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:16,850
These crazy guys
weren't affected like everyone else.

914
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,470
They wanted to see.

915
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,180
They were happy.

916
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:23,470
They were so glad.

917
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,520
And they said everyone needed to see.

918
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,470
Wait.

919
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,350
Get up and get out.
It's not an orphanage.

920
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:41,930
New guy, you had a great visit.
We really loved meeting you. Now fuck off.

921
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:46,350
And anybody who doesn't agree,
you go with him.

922
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:48,600
- Out now!
- Douglas, that is murder.

923
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,100
No. This is murder.

924
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:53,060
- Please.
- Letting strangers into this house.

925
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,600
Every contact we have had
with the outside has brought us death.

926
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,600
Lydia, Greg, Charlie.

927
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,600
If you wanna save people out there,

928
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,560
then you go right through that door
and you go do it.

929
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,390
We're not bringing
any more strangers in here.

930
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:10,270
Not while I'm alive.

931
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:13,180
I won't tell you again, get up and get...

932
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:22,770
Thank you.

933
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:25,600
You'll sleep in the garage.

934
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:37,140
The only reason I opened that door

935
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:39,890
is 'cause I remember
what it felt like to be outside of it.

936
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,180
If you guys hadn't let me in, I...

937
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,180
I feel like such a burden.

938
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:48,810
You are no more a burden than I am, okay?

939
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:50,470
- That's not true.
- It is. It is.

940
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,060
You're not soft like me.

941
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:55,600
I'm so spoiled.

942
01:09:56,470 --> 01:10:00,720
My parents have always done
everything for me and then my husband,

943
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:04,180
and I just...
I got soft from all that love.

944
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,470
Well, I was raised by wolves,
so consider yourself lucky.

945
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:17,270
If something happens to me,
I want you to take care of my baby.

946
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,140
Okay?

947
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,810
- No. No.
- Please.

948
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:22,180
- It's your baby.
- Malorie.

949
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:23,520
No.

950
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,770
- Promise me.
- Nothing is gonna happen to you.

951
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:26,680
It's your baby.

952
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:27,770
- Promise me.
- Nothing...

953
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,470
Please promise me.

954
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,140
Yeah, okay. Yeah, of course.

955
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,060
What is this?

956
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,810
Well, if I was just gonna tell you,

957
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:49,770
I wouldn't have bothered
putting it in this fancy... this fancy bag.

958
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,680
I got it on the supply run.

959
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:03,140
- It's so cute.
- Mm-hmm.

960
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:05,810
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

961
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,350
I know it's not the baby shower
you've always dreamt of.

962
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:15,970
No, it's... It's perfect.

963
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:20,520
And you can give it to your little one
when she's old enough, okay?

964
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:24,810
Thank you.

965
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:45,020
You guys, the river's speeding up.
It's time for a meeting.

966
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,890
I need to talk to you about the rapids.

967
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,890
The rapids are
where the water gets very bumpy.

968
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:08,180
It's very loud. It's very dangerous,

969
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:10,930
and it's gonna be
the hardest thing we have ever done.

970
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:17,350
And when we reach them, one of you
is gonna have a very important job.

971
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,060
One of you is gonna have to look.

972
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:27,390
And the person who looks,

973
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:31,350
they have to tell me
which direction to steer into

974
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,060
so that I go the right way.

975
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,390
Because if I look, we won't make it.

976
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:42,810
What if we see something?

977
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:45,520
- I'll do it.
- No, no, no, no.

978
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,850
I'm... I'm the one
who will say who looks, okay? I say it.

979
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:51,890
I'll say who goes. I'll say who looks.

980
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:53,640
I say who looks.

981
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,930
Testing. Testing. Hello?
Hello? Is anyone out there?

982
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,140
Hello? Testing, one, two, three. Hello?

983
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:30,970
Testing.

984
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:36,390
- I love this song.
- Me too.

985
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:37,720
- Me too.
- Me too.

986
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:40,890
- I've never actually heard it before.
- Hmm.

987
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,310
- It could be a false alarm, right?
- All right.

988
01:13:57,390 --> 01:13:58,890
We're going upstairs to the bedroom.

989
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:03,180
We need towels, sponges,
um... scissors, and lots of water.

990
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:06,680
Buckets of water. It's okay. It's okay.

991
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:09,020
It's okay.

992
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,680
It's okay.

993
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:12,720
Take it easy. I've got you.

994
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:15,100
It's okay. It's okay.

995
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:50,310
Ah, the scissors are in the, um, drawer
by the side of your left hand. Yeah.

996
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:05,310
- Okay, so the baby's coming.
- No, not happening.

997
01:15:05,390 --> 01:15:07,640
- Not happening.
- It's definitely coming.

998
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,100
- Come with me. Come with me.
- This is not happening.

999
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,770
It's happening. Let's go. Come on. Hey.

1000
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:15,140
- I have to do the water.
- We'll do the water.

1001
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,810
Okay, here we go.

1002
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,470
- You two are doing great.
- Oh, shut up.

1003
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:03,470
One more time.

1004
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,270
Come on. Come on.

1005
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:44,180
It's okay. It's okay.

1006
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:48,850
It's a boy.

1007
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:51,520
Oh.

1008
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,180
No.

1009
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,100
And your auntie thought you'd be a girl.

1010
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,390
Hey, new guy. New guy, let me in.

1011
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:30,640
Just come and unlock the door. Come on.

1012
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,560
Let me out. What are you doing?

1013
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:35,350
What?

1014
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:42,850
What are you doing?

1015
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,520
Gary?

1016
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:04,430
Gary!

1017
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,520
Hey.

1018
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,430
Tom! He put the birds in the freezer.

1019
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,430
Tom, I told you he's fucking crazy.

1020
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,600
Ga...

1021
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:29,850
Tom. Get the shotgun.

1022
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:31,310
He's crazy.

1023
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:42,680
What the fuck are you doing?
We let you into this house. We let...

1024
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:51,140
No! No! Fuck.

1025
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:55,770
Fucking asshole.
I knew you were a fucking lunatic.

1026
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:58,720
You fucking piece of shit. We saved you.

1027
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:00,850
Fuck!

1028
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:10,220
- Almost there.
- That's right. That's right.

1029
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:12,220
Yes! Yes!

1030
01:19:12,930 --> 01:19:13,850
Yes.

1031
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:14,930
Oh.

1032
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:17,220
You did it, Mama. You did it.

1033
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:22,220
Oh.

1034
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:23,720
Hello.

1035
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:26,430
You look so beautiful.

1036
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,310
What's going on down there?

1037
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,140
Can I see?

1038
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:43,770
So beautiful.

1039
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:44,970
Thank you.

1040
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:48,720
Can I see yours?

1041
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:57,640
Wow.

1042
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,100
Hum.

1043
01:20:01,770 --> 01:20:02,970
Thank you.

1044
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:06,350
Look at this.

1045
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:08,310
Look at this.

1046
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,786
- Olympia, cover your eyes.
- Isn't it beautiful?

1047
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:16,060
No. Why are you doing this?
Gary, please don't do this.

1048
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:18,850
- Look.
- Gary, please don't do this.

1049
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:21,390
- Show the baby.
- No, no, no, Olympia.

1050
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:23,140
Olympia, cover the baby's eyes.

1051
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:24,350
Olympia.

1052
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,270
See?

1053
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:29,970
- Show your baby.
- Olympia, let me see your baby.

1054
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,020
- You're not so bad.
- Olympia, let me see your baby.

1055
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:37,680
Keep the baby's eyes covered.
Let me see your baby, just for one minute.

1056
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:41,270
Olympia, let me hold your baby
just for one minute!

1057
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:42,350
Just one minute.

1058
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:44,600
Let me hold her for one minute, okay?

1059
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,270
- One minute.
- See.

1060
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:48,430
- Okay?
- See.

1061
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,560
See!

1062
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,890
No. Oh, no. Oh, please, no. Oh!

1063
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:05,890
- See it. See it.
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

1064
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38,850
Hey, Malorie.

1065
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:41,430
Give me the children.

1066
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:45,350
Give me the kids.

1067
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,680
Give me the children or I'll take them!

1068
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:50,640
Hey, asshole.

1069
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:52,390
Hey.

1070
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:55,180
What are you doing here?

1071
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:00,390
Have you come to see?

1072
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,680
Open your eyes.

1073
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,350
Don't be frightened.

1074
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:12,430
Look at me. Look at me.

1075
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,520
Look at me. Look at me!

1076
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:22,180
Ow.

1077
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:49,770
I'm sorry.

1078
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,680
I'm sorry that you didn't get to see.

1079
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:58,560
It is beautiful.

1080
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,020
So beautiful.

1081
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:05,270
I'm sorry.

1082
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:11,720
It shall cleanse the world.

1083
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:59,930
Please don't. Please don't hurt us.
Please stay away from us.

1084
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:02,470
Please. Please. Please. Please.

1085
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,350
Please don't do this. Don't do this.
Please don't do this.

1086
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:11,770
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1087
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:39,560
Listen to the clicks.

1088
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:43,640
Listen to the sounds,
if they're softer or louder.

1089
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:45,970
Listen to this.

1090
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,180
Listen.

1091
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:51,720
If they're louder,
you're in an open space. Do you hear that?

1092
01:24:51,810 --> 01:24:55,020
But if they're softer,
something is very close.

1093
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:57,470
Please. Anyone. Hello? Hello?

1094
01:24:58,270 --> 01:24:59,560
Hello, hel...

1095
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:04,060
Hello?

1096
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:55,390
Check it out. Yeah.

1097
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:59,310
There is nothing here.

1098
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:02,520
- Let's go to another spot.
- Fucking time.

1099
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:28,930
- Hey.
- Hey.

1100
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:53,720
What's wrong?

1101
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,220
I heard some of them again.

1102
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,520
What?

1103
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:01,810
A few of 'em...

1104
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:03,770
driving around.

1105
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:07,850
Driving around like
they're not blindfolded.

1106
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:10,890
Okay.

1107
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,810
No more runs alone.

1108
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,600
Okay.

1109
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:23,680
What's this?

1110
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:26,720
I was thinking like
a warning system for the kids.

1111
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:30,970
- If they're in trouble, ring the bell.
- Right. That's nice.

1112
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:38,060
How about this?

1113
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:40,140
Oh, it's...

1114
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,060
It's purely survival.

1115
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:43,890
- Purely survival?
- Yeah.

1116
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:23,100
Hello?

1117
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:24,970
Hello?

1118
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,640
Is anyone there? Hello?

1119
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:30,890
Testing. Testing.

1120
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:33,930
If there is anyone there, please respond.

1121
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:35,640
- Hello?
- Hello.

1122
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,140
Who is this?

1123
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:39,060
My name is Rick.

1124
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:40,720
Who is this?

1125
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:44,390
Rick, this is Tom.

1126
01:28:44,470 --> 01:28:45,810
We have a place.

1127
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:48,430
A compound with enough supplies...

1128
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:50,930
We have a community.

1129
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,640
It's safe here.

1130
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:56,680
We're down by the river's end.

1131
01:28:56,770 --> 01:28:59,060
- Where are you?
- Don't answer that.

1132
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:01,560
Near Pike's Quarry.

1133
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:05,680
Jesus. You're a ways away.
How many of you are there?

1134
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,350
- Four of us.
- Hmm-mm.

1135
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:09,970
Are any of them children?

1136
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:12,600
- Don't, do not say anything.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1137
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:16,140
No. Why?

1138
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:19,640
Because the fastest way
to get here is by the river,

1139
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:22,430
and I don't think
you could make it with kids.

1140
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:24,720
Wait, the river?

1141
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:27,060
Float downstream as far as you can.

1142
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:29,310
Stay on the water
until you hit the rapids.

1143
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:32,600
The water is fast there. It's dangerous.

1144
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:34,430
We've lost some people.

1145
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:37,390
You need to see clearly.

1146
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:40,100
- What does that mean?
- What do you mean, see clearly?

1147
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:43,310
You will have to look.

1148
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,850
- I'm telling you.
- Rick, we'll have blindfolds on.

1149
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:48,100
We can't look.

1150
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:50,060
I'm glad you said that.

1151
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:51,850
Someone will have to take a...

1152
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:57,520
Prepare for two days' journey
at the pace of the river's current.

1153
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,180
Bring supplies for longer.

1154
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,890
How do I find you after the rapids, Rick?

1155
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:03,220
You'll hear the birds.

1156
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:07,060
We've got a lot of them.
Just follow the sound to us.

1157
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:10,520
Down a small embankment,
you'll find a wall with a gate.

1158
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,600
That's our...

1159
01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:15,410
- That's their what?
- That's our what?

1160
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:17,310
Rick?

1161
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:19,520
Rick?

1162
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:31,810
It could be real.

1163
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:32,890
- No.
- Could be the truth.

1164
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:35,196
- Could be is not good enough.
- What if Rick could help us?

1165
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:36,850
And what if Rick is one of them?

1166
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:38,640
Huh?

1167
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,310
Wait, he knew about the birds.

1168
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:43,720
Oh, my God. Gary knew about the birds
and he put them in the freezer.

1169
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:46,020
I cannot believe
you're actually thinking about this.

1170
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:48,020
Every house has run out of food.
We have to move.

1171
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:51,220
You really don't think I know that?
You don't think I know that?

1172
01:30:56,770 --> 01:30:59,140
When I was little,
we had a boat just like this.

1173
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,970
And every single summer,
we would take it to the lake.

1174
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:03,060
Every summer.

1175
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:07,020
You guys would have loved it up there.
They had trees. They had flowers.

1176
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,470
The water was warm,
the clouds were in the sky.

1177
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:14,140
We'd all play in the water.
All the kids, all the children.

1178
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:16,220
We would all just run
up and down the shore.

1179
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:18,270
There were other children in the world?

1180
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:21,520
Yeah, just like you. Just like you.

1181
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,020
Like you.

1182
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:26,930
One day, we saw
this really, really big oak tree.

1183
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:28,560
It was bigger than this house.

1184
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:31,100
It was so big and old,
I couldn't see the top of it.

1185
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:32,600
- Guess what we did?
- Climbed it.

1186
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,310
We climbed it. Yes, we climbed it.

1187
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:36,770
We climbed it and climbed it
until we got to the top.

1188
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,360
Guess what we saw when we got to the top?

1189
01:31:39,390 --> 01:31:40,890
Boy! Girl! Time for bed.

1190
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:42,520
But Tom's telling a story.

1191
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,970
- Mal, let me just... We're almost done.
- I'm not gonna say it again. Come on.

1192
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:49,600
Girl, come on.

1193
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:52,100
Right now.

1194
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:53,180
Come on.

1195
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:55,430
Right now.

1196
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:57,390
Bed!

1197
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:02,866
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1198
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:06,010
Now they think they're gonna go outside
and climb trees with all these new kids

1199
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:08,060
- and see butterflies and flowers!
- It's a story.

1200
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:10,100
It's not a story. It's a lie.

1201
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:13,060
Because they'll never climb trees,
they are never gonna make new friends.

1202
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:15,810
- Why make them believe that?
- They have to believe in something.

1203
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:18,210
What is this for
if they don't have anything to believe in?

1204
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:20,430
- So that they survive!
- Surviving is not living.

1205
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,930
They're gonna die if they listen to you!

1206
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:28,430
Life is more than just what is. It's
what could be. What you could make it.

1207
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:31,390
You need to promise them dreams
that may never come true.

1208
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:34,810
You need to love them knowing
that you may lose them at any second.

1209
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:38,390
They deserve dreams. They deserve love.
They deserve hope. They deserve a mother.

1210
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,390
They deserve a mother.

1211
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:44,890
You haven't given them names, Mal.
Their names are Boy and Girl!

1212
01:32:44,970 --> 01:32:45,810
Think about that.

1213
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:48,390
Every single decision I have made
has been for them.

1214
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:50,640
Every single one.

1215
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:12,020
You know what I saw?

1216
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:15,930
At the top of the tree?

1217
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,060
I saw a nest.

1218
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:22,970
With five birds.

1219
01:33:23,970 --> 01:33:26,020
Sitting on the top branch.

1220
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:32,390
And then they just flew away.

1221
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:00,350
Got it. Got it. Sit. Sit!

1222
01:34:29,810 --> 01:34:31,180
It's safe. Come in.

1223
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:06,060
Wow.

1224
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:07,600
No, you did not.

1225
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:11,390
- They're probably stale.
- Yeah.

1226
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:13,430
Come here.

1227
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:15,930
Just how I like 'em.

1228
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:18,100
I'm sorry.

1229
01:35:20,430 --> 01:35:22,270
- Sorry.
- Me too.

1230
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:26,060
Come here.

1231
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:43,600
Kids.

1232
01:35:47,770 --> 01:35:49,520
This is strawberry.

1233
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,640
This is what strawberry tastes like.

1234
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,350
- What's that?
- Quiet.

1235
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:15,720
Shh.

1236
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:18,720
Anybody home?

1237
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:23,520
Take the kids out the back.
I'll distract them.

1238
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:26,470
If I'm not home in 15 minutes,
you take the kids to the boat and you go.

1239
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,140
- I'm not leaving you!
- Mal.

1240
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:30,390
- No, I'm not leaving you.
- Listen to me.

1241
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:32,850
I love you so much.

1242
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:36,310
I love you. Go.

1243
01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:38,270
- No!
- Go. Please go.

1244
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:40,100
Be good. Go.

1245
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:41,470
Go!

1246
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:42,720
I'm coming out!

1247
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:47,470
- Hey there, friend.
- Can I help you?

1248
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:50,720
I don't think so, friend.

1249
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:52,140
We can help you though.

1250
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:53,680
No. Go!

1251
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:56,430
- Take off your blindfold.
- Stand back.

1252
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,470
- Stand back!
- She's not moving.

1253
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:05,560
Hey. Got a woman and two kids over here.

1254
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:20,930
They're coming.

1255
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,270
They won't hurt you.

1256
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:25,060
Fuck it. Fuck it.

1257
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:27,430
On the contrary...

1258
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:31,060
it's a beautiful thing, friend.

1259
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:56,850
Listen to me.
I'm only gonna say this once.

1260
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:59,720
We are going on the trip now.
It's going to be rough.

1261
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:04,470
You have to do every single thing I say
or we will not make it.

1262
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:05,720
Understand?

1263
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:08,100
Where's Tom?

1264
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:10,310
He's not coming.

1265
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:30,770
It's time. It's time. It's time.

1266
01:40:44,470 --> 01:40:45,640
You remember the rapids?

1267
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,720
Remember I told you about the rapids?

1268
01:40:50,270 --> 01:40:51,270
Well, they're close.

1269
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:56,560
It is very dangerous and there's only
one way for me to navigate through them.

1270
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:58,640
Somebody has to look.

1271
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:01,600
- I'll look.
- No. I will decide! Okay? I will decide.

1272
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:03,560
Just give me... Just give me a second.

1273
01:41:11,390 --> 01:41:12,390
I'll do it.

1274
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:43,520
I love you so much.

1275
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:54,640
Nobody's looking.

1276
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:57,060
Okay, nobody's looking.

1277
01:41:58,270 --> 01:41:59,270
Okay?

1278
01:42:09,810 --> 01:42:11,350
Do your eyes. Let's do eyes.

1279
01:42:17,810 --> 01:42:20,930
Come on. Get on your knees.
Stay down low. Hold on tight.

1280
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:22,680
Don't move. Hold tight.

1281
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:41,430
Hold tight. Don't let go.
We're gonna be okay.

1282
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:44,220
Hold on!

1283
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:51,180
Please hold on. Hold on!

1284
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:01,100
Ah!

1285
01:43:06,270 --> 01:43:07,270
Ah!

1286
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:34,140
Girl! Boy!

1287
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:45,850
Girl! Boy!

1288
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:51,270
Girl! Boy! Boy?

1289
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:53,930
Girl!

1290
01:43:57,310 --> 01:43:58,520
Malorie.

1291
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:00,220
Boy!

1292
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:02,850
- Keep calling me!
- Help!

1293
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:04,720
- Malorie.
- Keep calling me.

1294
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:05,850
Malorie!

1295
01:44:05,930 --> 01:44:07,850
- I'm right here.
- Malorie!

1296
01:44:07,930 --> 01:44:09,810
- I'm coming. Where are you?
- Malorie.

1297
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:12,470
Where's Girl? Girl? Girl?

1298
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:16,220
Keep ringing. I hear you. Keep ringing.

1299
01:44:30,310 --> 01:44:31,770
Keep ringing, Girl.

1300
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:34,970
Keep ringing. Keep ringing.

1301
01:44:36,810 --> 01:44:38,220
Good girl.

1302
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:42,770
Okay. Good job. Get up. Stand up.

1303
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:48,600
Oh, good. Good, good, good.

1304
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:51,020
Good girl. Okay.
Do you guys hear those birds?

1305
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,890
That's where we're headed.
We just follow that sound.

1306
01:44:53,970 --> 01:44:55,810
Stay behind me.

1307
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:29,220
Psst.

1308
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:31,350
Dumb-dumb. Hey, dumb-dumb.

1309
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:35,270
Open your eyes, Malorie.
Dummy. I'm right here.

1310
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:37,930
No, no, no, no, no.

1311
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:39,390
No, you're not.

1312
01:45:39,470 --> 01:45:41,390
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1313
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:43,470
Malorie, look at me.

1314
01:45:47,270 --> 01:45:50,100
Look at me. Malorie, look at me.

1315
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:53,060
- Malorie, look at me.
- It's not real. It's not real.

1316
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:55,720
It's not real. It's not real.
it's not real.

1317
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:04,850
- Malorie?
- Malorie?

1318
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:10,680
Malorie?

1319
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:18,890
Malorie?

1320
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:34,310
Malorie. Malorie.

1321
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:35,720
Look at me, Malorie.

1322
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:37,970
- Boy. Girl.
- Malorie.

1323
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,680
Don't move. Stay right where you are!

1324
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:42,140
Open your eyes.

1325
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:44,100
Open your eyes.

1326
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:46,640
Malorie, open your eyes.

1327
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:58,810
Boy. Girl. Where are you?

1328
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:08,100
Come with me. Look at me.

1329
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,930
I need you. Just look at me.

1330
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:13,020
Can I really take off my blindfold?

1331
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:14,850
- Boy!
- It's safe?

1332
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:16,720
No, that's not me.

1333
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:20,520
No, no, no. Keep your blindfold on.

1334
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,020
Boy, that's not real.

1335
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:24,470
Keep your blindfold on. Listen to me.

1336
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:26,430
Listen to my voice! This is my voice!

1337
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:40,680
Girl, come with me. Look at me.

1338
01:47:41,770 --> 01:47:43,770
Take the blindfold off.
You can look at me.

1339
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:45,720
Isn't it dangerous if I look?

1340
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:50,270
No. No, I'm right here. I'm right here!
Do not take off your blindfold!

1341
01:47:50,350 --> 01:47:51,560
Please listen to me!

1342
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:52,930
- Malorie.
- What? No.

1343
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:55,220
- Please open your eyes.
- No. Girl, call out to me.

1344
01:47:55,310 --> 01:47:59,180
- It's just beautiful.
- Call out to me, please. Where are you?

1345
01:47:59,810 --> 01:48:02,720
Boy. Girl. Where are you?
Don't take my children.

1346
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:04,390
Do not take my children!

1347
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,826
Oh, baby, keep ringing. Keep ringing.

1348
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:12,430
Keep ringing, baby.
I'm coming. Keep ringing.

1349
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:14,970
Come on, keep ringing. Keep ringing.

1350
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:16,890
Oh, my God. I've got you.

1351
01:48:17,470 --> 01:48:21,430
I've got you. We're good. Where's Girl?
Where's Girl? Where's Girl?

1352
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:23,680
Girl. Girl! Girl!

1353
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:25,430
Where's Girl?

1354
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:27,270
She's scared of you.

1355
01:48:27,350 --> 01:48:28,520
What?

1356
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,060
She's scared of you.

1357
01:48:32,390 --> 01:48:33,390
It's okay.

1358
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:34,470
Uh...

1359
01:48:35,470 --> 01:48:37,270
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1360
01:48:38,270 --> 01:48:40,640
I'm so sorry, sweet girl. I'm so sorry.

1361
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:44,140
I was wrong.
I shouldn't have been so harsh.

1362
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:47,310
I shouldn't have stopped you from playing.

1363
01:48:47,850 --> 01:48:54,180
I shouldn't have ended Tom's story
because it wasn't finished.

1364
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:58,100
When he climbed to the very top
of that giant oak tree,

1365
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:01,560
he saw the most beautiful things.

1366
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:05,140
He saw hundreds of children playing games.

1367
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:06,310
Hundreds.

1368
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:08,520
And he saw birds...

1369
01:49:09,470 --> 01:49:11,020
all different colored birds,

1370
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:14,060
and... and he saw us.

1371
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:16,970
He saw us from the very top.

1372
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:19,680
He saw us together,
and we have to be together.

1373
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:22,390
And it's not just a story.

1374
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:26,470
It's not, because I have
so much I want to show you.

1375
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:30,720
I have so much I want you to see. Okay?

1376
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:32,970
But we have to do it together, okay?

1377
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:36,850
So I just need you
to come to me right now, okay? Please?

1378
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:38,390
Just come to me.

1379
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:40,390
Baby, come to me, okay?

1380
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:41,850
Oh! Ah.

1381
01:49:52,430 --> 01:49:55,640
I love you so much.
I love you so much. I love you so much.

1382
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,430
I love you so much.

1383
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,470
We need to find the birds, okay?
Find the birds.

1384
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:04,220
I want you to listen for the birds, okay?

1385
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:08,680
Listen for the birds.

1386
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:11,020
Okay, listen for the birds.

1387
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:22,720
Listen for the birds.
Just listen for the birds.

1388
01:50:22,810 --> 01:50:24,220
Malorie.

1389
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:31,890
Malorie.

1390
01:50:35,850 --> 01:50:38,520
Be quiet. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.

1391
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,930
Malorie,
I know you're scared, but it's me.

1392
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:45,180
Please. Where are you, Mal? I need help!

1393
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:48,220
Just take a peek and find me.

1394
01:50:50,430 --> 01:50:51,680
Come on.

1395
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:53,640
Come on.

1396
01:50:56,770 --> 01:50:58,600
Go to the birds. Where are the birds?

1397
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:06,520
Where are the birds?
The birds. Where are the birds?

1398
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:07,600
That way.

1399
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:12,640
I can't hear the birds!
I can't hear the birds!

1400
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:14,560
It's too loud. It's too noisy!

1401
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:17,470
Malorie! It's too loud!

1402
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:30,850
This way!

1403
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:07,970
Step. Step.

1404
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:11,770
Hello! Hello! Hello!

1405
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:14,270
Open the door. Please open the door!

1406
01:52:14,350 --> 01:52:17,390
My name is Malorie.
I'm Malorie. I have children.

1407
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:20,590
Please find Rick and tell Rick we followed
the river and we followed the birds.

1408
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:21,640
Malorie!

1409
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:23,116
- Help!
- Look at me, Malorie!

1410
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:25,640
- Please!
- Look at me, Malorie!

1411
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:27,060
Malorie.

1412
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:30,270
Okay. Just take the children.
Just take the children.

1413
01:52:30,350 --> 01:52:33,270
Take the children. They're just children.
Please let my children in!

1414
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:36,020
- Please! Open the door!
- Look at me!

1415
01:52:38,970 --> 01:52:41,520
Let me see your eyes!
Let me see your eyes!

1416
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:42,600
Okay.

1417
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:49,930
She's okay.

1418
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:53,020
She's okay. They're all okay.

1419
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:54,640
Get Rick.

1420
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:56,560
It's okay.

1421
01:52:58,470 --> 01:52:59,560
Malorie?

1422
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:00,640
Yes.

1423
01:53:01,470 --> 01:53:04,180
I'm Rick. Come with me.

1424
01:53:05,810 --> 01:53:06,720
Okay.

1425
01:53:06,810 --> 01:53:08,180
Right this way.

1426
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:14,270
You're inside and you're safe.

1427
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:17,810
You can take your blindfolds off.

1428
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:46,470
Come with me.

1429
01:54:14,350 --> 01:54:15,350
The birds.

1430
01:54:15,810 --> 01:54:18,560
They warn the sighted people
whenever those things are around.

1431
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:21,390
It's not much, but it's something.

1432
01:54:33,810 --> 01:54:36,220
I'm going to get you some dry clothes.

1433
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:47,270
Hey.

1434
01:54:48,060 --> 01:54:52,930
What do you guys say we let the birds go
and be with their friends?

1435
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:54,600
Shall we do that?

1436
01:54:56,770 --> 01:54:57,770
Okay.

1437
01:55:11,890 --> 01:55:12,890
Malorie?

1438
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:16,680
Malorie Hayes?

1439
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:18,470
Dr. Lapham.

1440
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:24,850
And what are your names?

1441
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:26,430
Girl.

1442
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:29,140
Boy.

1443
01:55:32,850 --> 01:55:33,850
Actually...

1444
01:55:35,890 --> 01:55:37,430
your name is Olympia.

1445
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:40,060
Yeah.

1446
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:43,680
Named after the sweetest girl I ever met.

1447
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:46,970
And your name...

1448
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:50,720
Your name is Tom.

1449
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:53,720
Tom.

1450
01:55:59,930 --> 01:56:01,520
And I am their mother.

1451
01:56:07,930 --> 01:56:09,576
Would you like to
play with the other kids?

1452
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,720
You want to go play?

1453
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:12,970
You want to go play?

1454
01:56:28,350 --> 01:56:30,640
Thank you. Thank you very much.
