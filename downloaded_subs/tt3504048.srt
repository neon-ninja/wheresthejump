1
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:14,307
- Take your time, Justin.
- I'm fucking trying.

2
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,971
Fuck!

3
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,319
If it pleases Your Honor,
as Miss Bucknell's crime

4
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:51,738
has been fueled by ongoing
methamphetamine and alcohol abuse,

5
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:56,191
the report does recommend
ongoing treatment at Tiaki Wairua.

6
00:02:56,296 --> 00:03:00,331
This... It's a new facility. It offers
courses in anger management,

7
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:03,706
substance abuse, social disorders.

8
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:09,806
They also teach basic job skills and
life skills like cooking, cleaning,

9
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:13,378
- budgeting.
- With respect, Mr. Hollis,

10
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:17,832
your client has been through a number
of these treatment programs in the past,

11
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:21,242
and as the events of the last
week probably would testify,

12
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:23,712
the results have been
less than spectacular.

13
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:27,887
Now, I agree with you that Miss
Bucknell is in need of rehabilitation,

14
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:29,904
but she is also in need of stability.

15
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,975
I therefore ordering an urgent report into
the suitability of her mother's house

16
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,733
at 57 Lynfield Road for a sentence
of eight months home detention.

17
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:40,028
Thank you. Stand down.

18
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:30,684
Do you want a few minutes
before we come in?

19
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:58,728
God. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I didn't even see you there.

20
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:02,660
I think that there's more damage to mine,
though, than there is to yours.

21
00:05:02,764 --> 00:05:05,130
Oh, yes, that just clips
on like that, does it?

22
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:06,695
Yep. That's all good to go.

23
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:09,618
Now, in the event that there's
an unauthorized absence,

24
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:11,218
you'll get a call to the modem.

25
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:14,141
If you don't respond, an officer
will be dispatched straightaway.

26
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:16,507
The bracelet has a fiber
optic cable inside it.

27
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:19,707
So if you try to break
it or if you damage it,

28
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:21,482
a tamper signal will be
sent out immediately.

29
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:24,577
Gosh, that's high-tech, isn't it?
Aren't you lucky, Kylie?

30
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:28,821
Having all that fancy technology
on your foot. Quite spoilt.

31
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:34,181
Keep coming.

32
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:36,407
Keep coming.

33
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:39,015
Keep coming.

34
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:42,843
Breach.

35
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:01,318
That's a flash phone, Kylie.
Is that one of those iPhones?

36
00:06:01,423 --> 00:06:03,719
- No.
- Flash, isn't it?

37
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:06,477
- Not really.
- See that, Graeme?

38
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:09,854
- Kylie's got one of those iPhones.
- It's not an iPhone.

39
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:14,934
That Leslie's a lovely
wee girl, isn't she?

40
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:18,941
I was just saying to Kylie, Graeme, the wee
Maori girl who gave Kylie a ride home,

41
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,133
she's very nice. Very well-spoken.

42
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:24,942
She was very well-spoken,
wasn't she, Kylie?

43
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:26,647
- She's a probation officer.
- Oh.

44
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,352
Still, it's nice to
meet an educated one.

45
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:30,960
God, you should see some
of the ones outside the TAB.

46
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:34,962
10:00 in the morning, they're lining up
to play the pokies, o shoes on their feet.

47
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:39,065
Half of them have got kids with them.
No shoes on their feet either.

48
00:06:56,741 --> 00:07:00,566
Welcome to the prepaid
top-up menu. To...

49
00:07:35,742 --> 00:07:36,995
Yes.

50
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:40,405
Well, no. Look,
'cause she just wouldn't.

51
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:43,174
No, you wouldn't read about it.

52
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:45,902
I need to use the phone.

53
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:48,720
Hang on a second, Jocelyn.
In a minute, Kylie. I'm on the phone.

54
00:07:48,825 --> 00:07:50,460
That's what I'm saying.
I need to use it.

55
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:54,078
Well, it'll have to wait.
This is a very important call.

56
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,444
Sorry, Jocelyn. What were you saying?

57
00:07:56,861 --> 00:08:00,548
Well, I don't know. I think
it's been going on for years.

58
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:04,620
Because I ran into him at the
Pak'nSave and I said to him

59
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:07,855
I said, "How's things," and he said,
"Oh, yeah, bit of a domestic."

60
00:08:09,804 --> 00:08:12,657
I know that's what he said.
"Bit of a domestic."

61
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:14,396
Well, that's what
he's like, isn't it?

62
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,909
Yeah. He is. He's a right hard case.

63
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:28,293
...both locally and internationally

64
00:08:28,398 --> 00:08:30,818
and safe to clean any exterior
surface around your home.

65
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:32,941

Or phone 0800-30-3000.

68
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:43,038
And now, Andrew Dickens.

69
00:08:43,143 --> 00:08:47,900
Call 0800-8010-80... on Newstalk ZB.

70
00:08:48,422 --> 00:08:50,441
It's open line talk back
with Andrew Dickens.

71
00:08:50,545 --> 00:08:52,007
Good evening, Miriam. How are ya?

72
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:55,172
Yes, thanks, Andrew.
I was actually listening before,

73
00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:57,921
and you had a lady talking about
ghosts and supernatural things.

74
00:08:58,025 --> 00:09:00,948
Oh, right. Yes, yes. We weren't
talking about cognitive bias,

75
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:03,905
which is where the brain deviates
from logical thought into fallacy.

76
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:07,906
It explains why people allow themselves to
interpret everyday things as paranormal.

77
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,063
I just think she didn't know
what she was talking about,

78
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:12,992
because I've had things happen to me
like that, and it has got nothing to do

79
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:15,735
- with a deviation in the brain.
- Okay, what sort of things?

80
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,100
Well, for as long as
I've lived in this house,

81
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:19,805
we've had all sorts
of stuff going on.

82
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,789
We've heard noises in
the middle of the night.

83
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:24,432
We've had things moving
about by themselves.

84
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:26,589
We've had, fluctuations
in the power bills.

85
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:29,164
Now, I'm not sure that qualifies
as bulletproof evidence.

86
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,912
But, see, I think that's the thing.
I think that's part of it.

87
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:35,322
And they do that on purpose so that you
don't know if you're imagining it or not.

88
00:09:35,426 --> 00:09:37,619
- Yeah, well.
- Having said all that,

89
00:09:37,723 --> 00:09:41,759
there was one incident in particular that
I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt,

90
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:45,272
took place in the real world
and not in my imagination.

91
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,847
There was one this night,
and I was in the basement

92
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:49,796
getting a chicken out of the freezer.

93
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,382
I was just bending over and
getting it out, and all of a sudden,

94
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:57,519
I got what I can only describe
as an enormous sense of dread.

95
00:09:57,623 --> 00:10:01,207
Like, every hair on my
body was standing upright.

96
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:07,001
And I turned around, and I saw this
thing disappear back into the darkness.

97
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:10,914
- God, you must have been petrified.
- Yes. I was out of there like a shot.

98
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:13,767
It took me two months to work up the
nerve to go back down there again.

99
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:16,237
So can you describe
what it looked like?

100
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:20,453
W... It happened very,
very quickly. But,

101
00:10:20,558 --> 00:10:23,196
Oh, gosh, what was it like?

102
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,318
It was sort of like a
white sheet or something,

103
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:29,563
but it was sort of...
tattered and faded.

104
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:34,537
But look, I've never seen it since,
and I hope I never do. Touch wood.

105
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:38,087
But to this day, I don't
know how to explain it.

106
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:41,809
Yes, well, I'm not sure I do either Miriam,
but thank you so much for your call.

107
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:43,617
Open line...

108
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:56,838
Finished with the phone?

109
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:05,501
Psychic hotline's just opened.
Maybe you wanna give them a call.

110
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,337
White sheet. That's original.

111
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:14,478
Would you mind putting
that cigarette out, please?

112
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,946
We don't smoke in the house.

113
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,917
You honestly think
this house is haunted?

114
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,635
I don't want to get into
this with you, Kylie.

115
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:32,709
Obviously, you're just
going to make fun of me.

116
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:35,179
There's nothing funny about
having a mother with dementia.

117
00:11:35,283 --> 00:11:37,545
You realize they put me on house
arrest to get some stability.

118
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:40,432
Well, obviously, you've got
a very selective memory.

119
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:43,669
What's that supposed to mean?

120
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:46,382
I'm not the only one who thought
there was a ghost in this house, Kylie.

121
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:48,748
In fact, you used to be so
terrified you couldn't sleep.

122
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:53,617
Yeah, I also use to think the moon was
made of cheese. It's called childhood.

123
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:20,341
Kylie.

124
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:25,886
Kylie, it's half past 11:00.

125
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,698
- Oh, no. I'm gonna be late.
- What for?

126
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:32,885
Nothing.

127
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,027
Nice being back home?

128
00:15:44,171 --> 00:15:47,167
Least there's plenty of space to
run around. Big place like this.

129
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:50,610
- How's things with your mum?
- Great.

130
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:53,508
- She seems like a nice lady.
- She's a fucking dick.

131
00:15:53,613 --> 00:15:56,454
Well, I think that's a
bit unfair. I mean...

132
00:15:56,558 --> 00:15:59,110
letting you come back home couldn't
have been an easy decision to make.

133
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:01,023
This isn't my home.

134
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:05,094
Okay, but considering you're going
to be spending a lot of time together,

135
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,042
don't you think you should
be making more of an effort?

136
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:08,850
No.

137
00:16:16,193 --> 00:16:20,716
- What's the situation with Graeme?
- He's a cabbage in a polar fleece.

138
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,594
- What's he doing for work?
- I don't fuckin' know.

139
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:24,925
He's around here somewhere.
Why don't you go and ask him?

140
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:27,791
What about your real father?

141
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:34,441
Miriam says he runs a boat
brokerage on the Gold Coast.

142
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:37,172
Done quite well for himself.

143
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:40,756
New life. New family. But...

144
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,539
she says he doesn't stay in touch.

145
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,117
- Have you ever considered...
- I'm giving you two more minutes

146
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:49,037
and then I'm turning the TV back on.

147
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:53,211
This watch was handed down
from my great-grandfather.

148
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:57,768
He was the owner of the St. Paul
Pioneer Press and Dispatch

149
00:16:57,873 --> 00:17:04,303
back in 1914, when he received this
watch, and it was handed down

150
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:08,450
to my father and then he gave
it to me. It's a beautiful watch.

151
00:17:08,554 --> 00:17:13,495
It's manufactured by the Patek-Phillipe
company of Geneva, Switzerland.

152
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,139
This is a photocopy of
the original warranty,

153
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:20,174
depicting some of the
complications of this watch.

154
00:17:20,278 --> 00:17:21,879
You let the fire go out.

155
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:28,035
...the front of the watch has the hour
and minute hand and the second hand.

156
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:38,995
Kylie, where's that meat loaf?

157
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:44,876
- I made that for tonight.
- Well, I've eaten it.

158
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,546
- A whole meat loaf?
- No.

159
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:49,015
The whole thing's gutted.

160
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:54,820
So I suppose I'll have to go
back to the supermarket

161
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:58,617
- and get something else for tea then?
- Well, I can't go, can I?

162
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:07,655
This watch, at auction, I suspect, would
bring close to a quarter million dollars.

163
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,203
- No.
- Yes.

164
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,222
That was your watch,
and to the police,

165
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:18,416
that clue's a homing pigeon.
Comes right back to you.

166
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,443
I'll take care of Romo and
find out who he's working for.

167
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:23,286
I'm the detective.

168
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,860
Kylie?

169
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:31,289
Kylie,

170
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:34,837
Thursdays and Fridays are
Coronation Street nights.

171
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:37,377
Now, it's only for an hour.

172
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:41,831
But it starts at 7:30.
And it's almost 7:30 now.

173
00:18:41,935 --> 00:18:45,110
Your gonna write this to
the Globe. Now, listen.

174
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,754
Kylie, please.

175
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:52,790
What's important? Who are you?
How did you get in here?

176
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,157
Exactly at 9:30?

177
00:18:59,261 --> 00:19:01,521
You have no right to take him.

178
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:08,275
Oh, for God's sake.
I can't even hear it.

179
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:15,019
I mean, why should we
be in here? It's our house.

180
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:19,978
You know, you could
say something to her.

181
00:19:20,804 --> 00:19:23,178
Tell you one thing, I'm not gonna
spend the next eight months

182
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:28,382
as a prisoner in my own home.
No way, buster.

183
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,957
She'll learn.

184
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:34,505
One way or another, she'll have to.

185
00:19:34,818 --> 00:19:39,098
- How long is the workout?
- Forty-five minutes a day, for 90 days.

186
00:19:39,202 --> 00:19:40,958
No need to spend countless
hours at the gym.

187
00:19:41,062 --> 00:19:43,666
- Tapout will even show you how to eat.
- Oh, that's good, isn't it?

188
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,952
And it's not a lot of time
each day to get results.

189
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:48,701
So, Lou, come on.
What's your favorite move?

190
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:50,893
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

191
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:52,458
Left jab. Right jab.

192
00:19:52,562 --> 00:19:56,459
Left hook. Right upper.
Left, right, left. Boom. Boom.

193
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,313
Boom. Boom. Boom.
Finish it with a kick! Are you ready?

194
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:01,365
- Bang!
- Missed the last bit, but never mind.

195
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:05,850
If you're serious about losing
weight, then this is for you.

196
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:49,097
If you want a Tapout body, you have
to come and get it. Come on. Boom!

197
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:22,150
Hello, Mortar.

198
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,375
Hello, Mortar.

199
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:11,554
Hello, Mortar.

200
00:22:24,984 --> 00:22:27,209
Hello, Mortar.

201
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:27,469
Jesus.

202
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:02,750
Let me just explain a couple
of things to you, Kylie.

203
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:04,733
Some of us have to go
to work in the morning.

204
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:07,238
Now, I realize being here is
an inconvenience for you,

205
00:24:07,342 --> 00:24:09,743
but that doesn't mean you have to be
an inconvenience to everybody else.

206
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:11,551
There's someone down there.
We need to call the police.

207
00:24:11,655 --> 00:24:14,247
You can do what you like.
I'm going back to sleep.

208
00:24:20,353 --> 00:24:23,309
- Where's Graeme?
- He's on the night shift.

209
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:25,746
He's on the night shift.

210
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:59,771
I can't stay like this
for long, Kylie. My knees.

211
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:16,995
That was a gift from your Uncle Melvin.
It's genuine Cameroon.

212
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:20,264
Good, then it won't break.

213
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,400
Is anyone here?

214
00:25:45,663 --> 00:25:48,760
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait. It's just me.

215
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:51,334
- What are you doing here?
- I got a break signal.

216
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:53,492
Oh, what you just happened
to be in the neighborhood.

217
00:25:53,596 --> 00:25:57,804
No. I live in the neighborhood.

218
00:26:33,363 --> 00:26:36,528
Looks like he's taken off already.

219
00:26:37,258 --> 00:26:39,069
What was he... What did he look like?

220
00:26:39,173 --> 00:26:41,399
I told you I didn't get
a good look at him.

221
00:26:41,503 --> 00:26:44,042
- What was he wearing?
- I don't know.

222
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:50,654
Look, I came down to look for
my phone. My bracelet went off.

223
00:26:50,758 --> 00:26:53,678
Somebody grabbed my leg,
but I only saw his hand.

224
00:26:54,307 --> 00:26:56,187
- How come your bracelet went off?
- Why are you asking me?

225
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:57,713
Why don't you tell him
what you really saw?

226
00:26:57,817 --> 00:27:01,196
- Why don't you shut up?
- I'm sorry, Amos.

227
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,213
It's just that this house is
prone to certain disturbances.

228
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:07,250
- Mum.
- What do you mean?

229
00:27:07,354 --> 00:27:12,988
Well, there may be one or two occupants
who haven't quite left the premises.

230
00:27:15,132 --> 00:27:16,979
No, I'm sorry. I still
don't get what you mean.

231
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:19,218
Well...

232
00:27:19,322 --> 00:27:22,558
Obviously, my daughter and I have
a difference of opinion on the matter.

233
00:27:22,662 --> 00:27:27,255
But based on personal experience,
I have what I feel...

234
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,565
is some reason to believe
that the house...

235
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:34,429
could, in fact, be,

236
00:27:34,596 --> 00:27:36,229
you know,

237
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:39,569
haunted.

238
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:42,248
Really?

239
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:55,749
This is the record I.D. for the
house of Kylie and Miriam Bucknell.

240
00:27:55,854 --> 00:28:01,421
The date is the 18th of March, 2013.
The time, 2:30 a.m.

241
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:03,576
What are you doing?

242
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:17,056
To the restless spirit that lives in
this house, what is your business here?

243
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:31,409
Did you leave this world
not of your own free will?

244
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:45,779
Is there anyone here today
you want to communicate with?

245
00:28:49,886 --> 00:28:52,805
You honestly think
somebody's gonna answer?

246
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,736
Maybe they already have.

247
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:05,574
To the restless spirit that lives in
this house, what is your business here?

248
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:17,614
Did you leave this world
not of your own free will?

249
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:30,729
Is there anyone here today
you want to communicate with?

250
00:29:41,168 --> 00:29:43,915
Do you honestly think
somebody's gonna...

251
00:29:45,134 --> 00:29:47,495
I'll run that through a
filter when I get home.

252
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,269
- You mentioned some disturbances?
- Yes.

253
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:51,250
Banging on the walls,
knocking on the pipes?

254
00:29:51,355 --> 00:29:54,668
- Taps turning on and off, that kind of thing?
- Oh, day and night.

255
00:29:54,773 --> 00:29:57,974
I mean the furnace could account for
some of the banging if it actually went,

256
00:29:58,078 --> 00:30:01,174
but the thing's been
busted for years.

257
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,948
It's colder in here. You notice that?

258
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:06,811
Yeah. No, we tried to get it
going again, but it's so old.

259
00:30:06,915 --> 00:30:09,177
You just can't get parts for it.

260
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:12,134
I'd say it's dropped another
four degrees, at least.

261
00:30:12,238 --> 00:30:14,256
We were supposed to get
one of those heat pumps.

262
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,561
But then they went and cut
the blimmen, whatchamacallit.

263
00:30:17,665 --> 00:30:21,145
- How long have you lived here?
- Oh, about 20 years now.

264
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:22,698
What do you know about
the previous owners?

265
00:30:22,803 --> 00:30:26,259
Not much I'm afraid. It was my
ex-husband who bought the place.

266
00:30:26,364 --> 00:30:30,052
But the lady who was here before
us lived here for quite some time.

267
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:32,591
We never dealt with her though.
She passed away.

268
00:30:32,695 --> 00:30:34,504
- How did she die?
- Pardon?

269
00:30:34,608 --> 00:30:37,705
- How did she die?
- Oh, she was quite old, I think.

270
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:41,358
Yeah. No, she used to run a B&B.

271
00:30:41,462 --> 00:30:44,176
Actually, I thought about doing that
myself with the place at one time.

272
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,951
You were going to run a B&B?

273
00:30:46,055 --> 00:30:49,012
I have wanted to do other things with my
life besides put up with your nonsense.

274
00:30:49,116 --> 00:30:52,457
- Who would want a holiday in Bulford?
- We live on the Twin Coast Highway, Kylie.

275
00:30:52,562 --> 00:30:56,769
- Lots of tourists drive through here.
- Yeah, at warp fucking speed.

276
00:30:59,586 --> 00:31:03,452
So what I'd like to do now, Miriam, we'll
kick this operation off into phase two.

277
00:31:03,556 --> 00:31:07,000
We'll start with a daisy chain of EMF
readers, microphones, data loggers,

278
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:10,166
and then, if it's okay with you, we'll
set up some closed-circuit surveillance,

279
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,463
see if we can't figure out
exactly what we're dealing with.

280
00:31:12,567 --> 00:31:14,897
Oh. Well, I appreciate
you trying to help, Amos.

281
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:18,342
It's just... I don't think I can
actually afford to pay for all that.

282
00:31:18,446 --> 00:31:20,673
Please, Miriam,
this is a pro bono gig.

283
00:31:20,777 --> 00:31:24,533
It's the advancement of paranormal
research that's reward enough.

284
00:31:26,936 --> 00:31:29,580
Just be careful if you're putting
nails in that wall, Amos,

285
00:31:29,684 --> 00:31:32,383
'cause the last time Graeme
tried to put a shelf up in here,

286
00:31:32,487 --> 00:31:35,330
- he actually hit a power cable.
- Thanks for the concern, Miriam,

287
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,484
but I always check the circuit's
off before an installa...

288
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:40,921
Oh. Shit.

289
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:42,833
Are you all right?

290
00:31:43,426 --> 00:31:45,720
Did you hurt yourself?

291
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:52,506
At some stage... you just might
want to get your wiring checked.

292
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:04,058
What are you doing now?

293
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:07,225
Just getting a baseline
reading for the data loggers.

294
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:11,538
- What are they supposed to log?
- Fluctuations in room temperature.

295
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:13,209
Ghosts have a lower body
temperature than humans.

296
00:32:13,313 --> 00:32:15,122
Do they?

297
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:18,177
Yeah, they do.

298
00:32:18,282 --> 00:32:21,245
You know, the closed mind is the worst
defense against the paranormal, Kylie.

299
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:23,228
What are you gonna do
against a hostile spirit?

300
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:26,974
- You just gonna crack jokes?
- No, I'm going to smash it in the face.

301
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:31,186
You cannot punch ectoplasm.

302
00:32:52,627 --> 00:32:57,219
Nice. You know, I can still see you.

303
00:33:16,216 --> 00:33:19,450
I can hear you breathing.

304
00:33:27,907 --> 00:33:30,479
The fuck did you just say?

305
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,700
Stop tickling me.

306
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,772
I just want to be friends.

307
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:05,062
I could never do that to my friend.

308
00:34:42,674 --> 00:34:45,148
Could you give that a shake,
please, Miriam?

309
00:35:08,281 --> 00:35:10,541
- What about the cameras?
- Checked the cameras remotely.

310
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:11,656
- And?
- And what?

311
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,439
Spend eight hours waiting for a
teddy bear to crawl out of a fireplace.

312
00:35:14,543 --> 00:35:17,605
- It was pretty uneventful.
- You think I'm making this up.

313
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:19,344
Honestly, I don't know.

314
00:35:19,448 --> 00:35:21,745
But unless I have reason to think
otherwise, I have to remain skeptical.

315
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,120
Skeptical? The other night you were
practically creaming your pants.

316
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:27,938
And you thought it was all a big joke.
Interesting turn of events.

317
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:31,939
Hey. I've got better things to do with
my time than make up ghost stories.

318
00:35:32,356 --> 00:35:34,685
Sure you do.

319
00:35:48,673 --> 00:35:51,527
Our brains are made up
of cells called neurons.

320
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:54,797
These cells have nerve
endings called synapses.

321
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:58,415
Synapses release chemical
and electrical stimuli

322
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,173
which communicate with each
other to form neuropath ways.

323
00:36:02,278 --> 00:36:04,991
- Now, if we...
- How long have you been a counselor?

324
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:10,036
Oh. Gosh... 15, 16 years.

325
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:12,990
A few years of study prior to that.

326
00:36:14,448 --> 00:36:17,604
So you got, like, a diploma?

327
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:21,029
A doctorate in clinical psychology.

328
00:36:24,996 --> 00:36:27,987
My mum thinks this house is haunted.

329
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:34,840
And what do you think?

330
00:36:37,557 --> 00:36:40,697
Some things have happened
since I've been here.

331
00:36:42,905 --> 00:36:45,139
Things I can't explain.

332
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:50,953
When you put an overactive
mind in an inactive environment,

333
00:36:51,058 --> 00:36:53,817
there's bound to
be complications. Particularly,

334
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:57,246
- if chemical substances are involved.
- I'm not on drugs.

335
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:04,038
Well, the easiest way to
maintain a healthy mind

336
00:37:04,143 --> 00:37:07,094
is to make sure it has
plenty of exercise.

337
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:11,401
Now, look, you can view the next
eight months as a punishment,

338
00:37:11,505 --> 00:37:16,696
or you can see it as...
as an opportunity.

339
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:49,502
- Jesus Christ! Graeme, what the fuck!
- Sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.

340
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,871
What do you want?

341
00:39:53,095 --> 00:39:54,801
I'm just wondering if
you're not doing anything,

342
00:39:54,905 --> 00:39:56,948
maybe you wouldn't mind
helping me with this.

343
00:39:57,052 --> 00:39:59,694
Piss off. I'm not your slave.

344
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:31,633
If you hold this piece,
I can put this piece on top.

345
00:40:45,621 --> 00:40:49,099
Just need to hold it
in place until it sets.

346
00:40:51,954 --> 00:40:54,839
- How long does that take?
- Ten minutes.

347
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:07,050
Sorry I'm not much
of a conversationalist.

348
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:09,937
What?

349
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,515
Well, just, we don't really talk.

350
00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:16,105
It's fine. Neither am I.

351
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:21,906
- If you wanted to...
- I don't though.

352
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:24,341
No.

353
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:29,285
It's just...

354
00:41:30,327 --> 00:41:32,173
I suppose what I'm trying to say
is that I don't want you to think

355
00:41:32,277 --> 00:41:34,851
I've got anything
against you or nothin'.

356
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:39,067
My old man was never
really there, you know.

357
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:43,967
My mum, she wasn't much better.
I don't know.

358
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:49,846
I think maybe I was the only reason
they stayed together probably.

359
00:41:50,924 --> 00:41:54,838
And maybe they resented me for
that or something. I don't know.

360
00:41:55,100 --> 00:42:00,418
The thing is, I never
talked openly about things.

361
00:42:00,563 --> 00:42:02,685
And you're the closest thing
to a daughter that I've got.

362
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:05,990
You don't feel cramped in here?
Look at the state of this fucking room.

363
00:42:06,095 --> 00:42:07,729
- No wonder you've got asthma.
- Angina.

364
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:11,243
If you cleared some shit out of here,
you could have a half decent work space.

365
00:42:11,348 --> 00:42:13,366
Your mum's a bit funny about
throwing things away.

366
00:42:13,471 --> 00:42:17,367
Yeah 'cause you never know when you're
gonna need a three-quarter scale Jesus.

367
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,985
Besides, if it means that much to her,
why does she keep it in the basement?

368
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:23,961
Most of this stuff was here
when she bought the place.

369
00:42:25,664 --> 00:42:29,266
- Why didn't they just take it with them?
- Well, they left in a bit of a hurry.

370
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:32,117
And most of this stuff
was probably donated.

371
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:35,119
Why would anyone donate
to a bed and breakfast?

372
00:42:39,773 --> 00:42:43,160
Why would anyone donate to
a bed and breakfast, Graeme?

373
00:42:44,725 --> 00:42:47,507
I think you better go
and talk to your mum.

374
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:50,121
Look, it wasn't even my idea.
It was your father's.

375
00:43:50,226 --> 00:43:52,523
He knew they'd want rid of
the place as quickly as possible,

376
00:43:52,627 --> 00:43:54,366
so he made them a cash offer.

377
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:57,672
And he had some idea about moving the place
off-site and restoring it somewhere else

378
00:43:57,776 --> 00:44:00,212
and then subdividing the section
off to the neighbors or something.

379
00:44:00,316 --> 00:44:03,517
Look, I don't remember the details exactly,
but the way he explained it to me...

380
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:05,187
we would've got twice
what we paid for it.

381
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:08,456
You knew a girl was murdered in my
room and you still let me live in it.

382
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:11,867
It wasn't an ideal situation, but as I said,
it was only supposed to be short term.

383
00:44:11,971 --> 00:44:15,659
Ideal? She was stabbed 67
times with a meat fork.

384
00:44:15,764 --> 00:44:18,547
Listen, when you start working and
you have to pay bills of your own,

385
00:44:18,651 --> 00:44:21,504
we'll see how quick you are to
snub your nose at a bargain.

386
00:44:21,608 --> 00:44:23,383
I can see why you never
open your mouth, Graeme.

387
00:44:23,487 --> 00:44:25,156
Don't blame him. He thought
you'd already told me.

388
00:44:25,261 --> 00:44:28,183
- Why didn't you?
- Because you were four years old.

389
00:44:28,288 --> 00:44:29,994
And by the time you were old
enough to know the truth,

390
00:44:30,098 --> 00:44:31,976
you never wanted to
speak to me anyway.

391
00:44:33,436 --> 00:44:36,426
Look, I'm sorry, Kylie. Okay?

392
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:41,507
I guess I just thought... what you
didn't know wouldn't hurt you.

393
00:44:45,858 --> 00:44:49,164
"In what was considered one of New
Zealand's most brutal murders,

394
00:44:49,268 --> 00:44:52,225
Elizabeth Chalmers, or Lizzy as
she was more commonly known,

395
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:54,626
had been beaten, bitten

396
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,348
and stabbed over 60 times
with a carving fork.

397
00:44:58,452 --> 00:45:02,558
Police claimed to have multiple suspects,
but to date, no arrests have been made.

398
00:45:02,663 --> 00:45:07,221
After alleged reports of assault against
staff and an increase in neighborhood crime,

399
00:45:07,326 --> 00:45:11,012
this was the last in a long line
of unwanted controversies

400
00:45:11,116 --> 00:45:13,657
for the church-owned and
operated halfway house

401
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:16,371
which was forced to
finally shut its doors

402
00:45:16,476 --> 00:45:20,404
on February 28, 1996."

403
00:45:23,085 --> 00:45:25,451
I may have been a bit hasty
with my initial investigation.

404
00:45:26,077 --> 00:45:29,692
If I had to make a bet, I'd say
this place is crawling with NRE.

405
00:45:30,078 --> 00:45:33,070
- What?
- Negative residual energy.

406
00:45:33,279 --> 00:45:35,770
- It's what happens when a spirit...
- I don't need to know the lingo.

407
00:45:35,874 --> 00:45:38,268
- I just need you to get rid of it.
- Well, it's not that simple.

408
00:45:38,372 --> 00:45:40,324
- Why did you say it was?
- I didn't.

409
00:45:40,429 --> 00:45:42,674
All I said is I could help you
figure out what we're dealing with.

410
00:45:42,778 --> 00:45:45,491
And now we know. A murdered
girl who needs our help.

411
00:45:45,595 --> 00:45:47,404
So what are you suggesting? A séance?

412
00:45:47,509 --> 00:45:50,153
You wanna light some candles, play pass
the parcel with a fucking dead girl?

413
00:45:50,257 --> 00:45:51,719
I don't have time for that.

414
00:45:51,823 --> 00:45:55,578
Kylie, as long as you live in this house,
I'm not sure you have a choice.

415
00:45:58,048 --> 00:45:59,781
The thing about the
justice system, Kylie,

416
00:45:59,886 --> 00:46:02,331
is that they don't really like
to make special allowances.

417
00:46:02,435 --> 00:46:05,392
I'm not asking them to change the sentence.
I'm just asking for a transfer.

418
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,279
And in another three months,
once you've shown some compliance,

419
00:46:08,384 --> 00:46:11,446
- maybe we can ask the judge to reconsider.
- Three months? I could be dead by then.

420
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:14,055
- What we need is some perspective.
- Would you shut up, Dennis?

421
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:17,360
I don't need a counseling session.
I just need to get out of this house.

422
00:46:17,465 --> 00:46:21,955
Look, Kylie, unless we can prove
that you're in danger to yourself

423
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:25,328
or someone else, then you'll to have to
remain here for the time being, okay?

424
00:46:25,432 --> 00:46:28,771
Now, I won't be offended if
you don't eat any of these...

425
00:46:46,446 --> 00:46:47,838
Miriam, with respect,

426
00:46:47,942 --> 00:46:51,316
I'm worried about how these superstitions
might be affecting Kylie's...

427
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,500
Oh, dear.

428
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:54,310
Oh, no. They've been
doing this all week.

429
00:46:54,414 --> 00:46:56,989
Hold on. I'll go and have
a look at the switchboard.

430
00:46:57,093 --> 00:47:00,433
It's these old houses, you see.
It doesn't take much to overload them.

431
00:47:00,537 --> 00:47:03,634
- Oh, God. What have I done that for?
- Do you need a hand, Miriam?

432
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,174
No, I've gotta try to turn
the light switch on and off.

433
00:47:06,278 --> 00:47:09,232
Forgot that's why I'm out here
in the first place. Hold on.

434
00:47:11,145 --> 00:47:14,177
I'll have to do it by feel 'cause
I can't see what I'm doing.

435
00:47:14,871 --> 00:47:17,064
Right.

436
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:19,819
- What does that one do?
- No.

437
00:47:21,863 --> 00:47:24,960
- Anything?
- No.

438
00:47:27,082 --> 00:47:28,301
Oh. That was it.

439
00:47:28,405 --> 00:47:30,736
- Was it?
- The one you did before.

440
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:33,589
What was that?

441
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:36,962
Jesus Christ!

442
00:47:54,533 --> 00:47:57,178
So from what I understand,

443
00:47:57,282 --> 00:48:00,866
you showed some aggressive
behavior towards Mr. McRandle

444
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:02,849
in the moments leading
up to the incident,

445
00:48:02,953 --> 00:48:04,450
- is that correct?
- No.

446
00:48:04,554 --> 00:48:07,859
Okay, so you didn't say,
"Shut the fuck up, Dennis.

447
00:48:07,964 --> 00:48:11,442
I don't need a counseling session.
I need to get out of this house."

448
00:48:11,546 --> 00:48:13,357
To which Mr. Hollis replied,

449
00:48:13,461 --> 00:48:17,427
"Unless we can prove that you're a
danger to yourself or someone else,

450
00:48:17,532 --> 00:48:19,201
you will have to
remain in this house."

451
00:48:19,305 --> 00:48:22,194
Now, this was in regards to a request
that you made for a transfer.

452
00:48:22,298 --> 00:48:24,872
Listen, I didn't have
anything to do with this.

453
00:48:24,977 --> 00:48:26,681
I wasn't even in the
room at the time.

454
00:48:26,786 --> 00:48:28,908
- Can you just stand over there, please?
- What?

455
00:48:29,012 --> 00:48:31,933
Can you just stand over there
while we talk to your mum?

456
00:48:39,137 --> 00:48:40,703
Anything you want to tell us, Miriam?

457
00:48:40,807 --> 00:48:45,144
I... I don't think there's
anything else to add.

458
00:48:45,248 --> 00:48:47,278
It's all been a bit much,
to be honest.

459
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,714
So are you happy to
proceed with the story

460
00:48:49,818 --> 00:48:53,921
that Mr. McRandle was
attacked by a vengeful ghost?

461
00:48:55,941 --> 00:48:58,319
- Yes.
- Righto.

462
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:04,865
Look, I'm not overly familiar with
things of the supernatural nature,

463
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:07,874
so I don't give any advice on that.

464
00:49:41,936 --> 00:49:43,641
You realize I had to call
the probation office?

465
00:49:43,745 --> 00:49:45,868
- Good.
- Get in the car.

466
00:49:45,972 --> 00:49:47,920
- No.
- I'm not gonna ask again.

467
00:49:48,024 --> 00:49:49,729
Oh, fuck off. What can you do?

468
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:52,229
When are you gonna stop acting
like a baby and start thinking

469
00:49:52,334 --> 00:49:55,366
- about someone other than yourself?
- What?

470
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:59,505
If you were stabbed to death and no one
gave a shit, how do you think you'd feel?

471
00:50:01,651 --> 00:50:02,763
Fucked off.

472
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:04,968
Why do you think it's you she
chose to communicate with?

473
00:50:05,072 --> 00:50:06,257
I don't fuckin' know.

474
00:50:06,361 --> 00:50:09,144
Well, let me give you a hint. You both
feel like the world owes you something.

475
00:50:09,248 --> 00:50:13,040
You're both permanently pissed off.
And you're both stuck up in that house.

476
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:16,832
Except her sentence doesn't last
eight months. It lasts forever.

477
00:50:16,936 --> 00:50:19,823
Unless someone's
willing to help her out.

478
00:50:23,894 --> 00:50:26,503
It's not gonna change anything.

479
00:50:27,531 --> 00:50:29,739
Maybe she doesn't expect it to.

480
00:50:32,218 --> 00:50:34,878
Maybe she just wants you to listen.

481
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:22,327
You know what, Lizzy? If you've
got something to say to me,

482
00:51:22,431 --> 00:51:24,709
could you just fucking say it?

483
00:53:12,007 --> 00:53:14,372
Hello, Mortar.

484
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:10,771
So you think this was Elizabeth's?

485
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:14,144
How many 15-year-old girls
do you know with dentures?

486
00:54:23,992 --> 00:54:27,994
I've got a theory if you wanna hear it.
I reckon she was a thief.

487
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,951
I reckon she was ripping off the neighbors,
and one of them got wise to it.

488
00:54:31,055 --> 00:54:32,169
- How?
- It doesn't matter how.

489
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:35,160
The point is he decides to take
matters into his own hands.

490
00:54:35,265 --> 00:54:37,770
He sneaks into her room,
waits for her to come back.

491
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:41,144
When she opens the vent to hide
her stash, his suspicion pays off.

492
00:54:41,561 --> 00:54:42,780
How's this come into it?

493
00:54:42,885 --> 00:54:45,354
The newspaper article
said she was bitten.

494
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:47,198
But I don't think that
was part of his plan.

495
00:54:47,303 --> 00:54:48,939
I think he just got caught
up in the frenzy of it,

496
00:54:49,043 --> 00:54:51,791
and he never would have thought
to take out his dental plate first.

497
00:54:51,896 --> 00:54:54,123
So he bites into her neck
like a fuckin' maniac.

498
00:54:54,227 --> 00:54:56,940
His teeth fall down the vent. But there's
nothing he could have done about it.

499
00:54:57,045 --> 00:55:00,377
All he can do is make sure
nobody else ever finds it.

500
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:03,620
- Why are you making that face?
- I don't know. It seems thin.

501
00:55:04,037 --> 00:55:05,464
What about it seems thin?

502
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:07,517
For starters, who kills
someone over a brooch?

503
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:10,579
It's not a brooch, you fuckwit.
It's a Vacheron Constantin.

504
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:14,301
It's over a hundred years old, and it still
works, which means it's worth a lot of money.

505
00:55:14,406 --> 00:55:17,571
Whoever it belonged to took it's
disappearance pretty personally.

506
00:55:17,676 --> 00:55:19,555
So why did he leave it behind?

507
00:55:19,659 --> 00:55:21,399
I'm sorry, Amos.
Did you have some ideas?

508
00:55:21,503 --> 00:55:24,182
Am I hogging the floor here? Is there
something you'd like to bring to the table?

509
00:55:24,286 --> 00:55:25,921
Don't get shitty.
I'm just being devil's advocate.

510
00:55:26,026 --> 00:55:29,120
No, you're undermining me,
and it's starting to piss me off.

511
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:34,133
Obviously, he meant
to take it with him.

512
00:55:34,237 --> 00:55:36,533
But after he'd just spent
a fortnight stabbing her,

513
00:55:36,637 --> 00:55:39,455
he probably had to make a quick exit.

514
00:55:45,474 --> 00:55:46,971
His name's Mads Kraglund.

515
00:55:47,075 --> 00:55:49,267
He's been in that house
since before we got here.

516
00:55:49,371 --> 00:55:51,181
Mum's had to call the
council a bunch of times

517
00:55:51,285 --> 00:55:54,138
because of this rancid smell
that wafts over the fence.

518
00:55:54,242 --> 00:55:57,165
Well, he's skinning possums.
That'll be the smell.

519
00:55:57,269 --> 00:56:02,036
You know what else causes
a rancid smell? Dead people.

520
00:56:02,453 --> 00:56:04,889
Mum reckons that when one of the other
neighbors confronted him about it,

521
00:56:04,993 --> 00:56:06,663
Kraglund pulled a gun on him.

522
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:08,437
Then when the cops
tried to sort it out,

523
00:56:08,541 --> 00:56:11,361
she said they found a fridge
full of aborted fetuses.

524
00:56:11,465 --> 00:56:15,396
Well, you know, your mum's
got a penchant for gossip.

525
00:56:15,813 --> 00:56:18,283
Maybe, but one thing she
doesn't have is an imagination.

526
00:56:18,387 --> 00:56:21,066
She couldn't make up
something like that.

527
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:25,625
All right, look, I'll set up a
camera on the borderline.

528
00:56:25,729 --> 00:56:29,035
If he gets up to anything out of the
ordinary, we'll know all about it.

529
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:31,608
Fuck that noise. I say we
break in there tonight.

530
00:56:31,712 --> 00:56:34,775
Kylie, I'm not losing
my job over this.

531
00:56:34,879 --> 00:56:38,218
Not unless I've got a reason to
believe that this guy's a killer.

532
00:56:50,779 --> 00:56:53,841
If that dental plate matches,
this could all be over tomorrow.

533
00:56:53,945 --> 00:56:56,659
- I can't just break into the guy's house.
- Then let me do it.

534
00:56:56,763 --> 00:56:58,503
No. You know that's not possible.

535
00:56:58,607 --> 00:57:01,564
You know, you've got some nerve.
Two days ago I was gonna walk.

536
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,382
You were the one who made me give
a shit. Do you remember that speech?

537
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:06,958
Look, even if I could convince them
that there was a fault with the modem,

538
00:57:07,062 --> 00:57:08,941
the best I could get you
would be half an hour.

539
00:57:09,045 --> 00:57:12,037
I know this guy's routine.
He doesn't get out of bed before 2:00.

540
00:57:12,141 --> 00:57:16,590
All I need to do is go in and get it while
he's asleep. It'll take me three minutes.

541
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:19,799
Fuck.

542
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,585
- What are you doing?
- Just in case we need to break a window.

543
00:57:46,689 --> 00:57:48,985
What? You never said anything
about breaking windows.

544
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,601
Well, I don't suppose he's gonna leave
a key under the mat for us, is he?

545
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,512
Hey, you should see this guy's house.

546
00:59:11,616 --> 00:59:13,565
- Did you get the dental plate?
- I think he's got it with him.

547
00:59:13,669 --> 00:59:16,695
Oh! Well, come on. Let's go.

548
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,624
- I might take a look around.
- What?

549
00:59:18,728 --> 00:59:20,987
Well, I'm not gonna leave here empty-handed.
There's got to be something else

550
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:22,550
- we can pin on him.
- Kylie.

551
00:59:22,654 --> 00:59:26,018
- Just wait there. I'll be two seconds.
- Kylie.

552
01:01:15,688 --> 01:01:18,093
- What's your problem?
- My leg!

553
01:01:23,831 --> 01:01:26,059
- I think I should go back in there.
- What?

554
01:01:26,163 --> 01:01:28,626
I thought he sprung me, but he's
completely whacked off his nut.

555
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,958
I saw the dental plate.
It's in a pile of newspapers...

556
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:32,125
Do you know what this is?

557
01:01:32,226 --> 01:01:34,439
This is what happens when a shitty
idea blows up in your face.

558
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:37,438
Except it doesn't blow up in your face,
Kylie. It blows up in mine.

559
01:01:37,539 --> 01:01:40,018
Now, please stop pissing
around and help me.

560
01:02:04,066 --> 01:02:05,072
Go.

561
01:02:35,703 --> 01:02:38,439
I need a number
for Bucknell, Bulford.

562
01:02:38,545 --> 01:02:40,990
Yes. Yeah. Lynfield Road.

563
01:02:42,729 --> 01:02:45,060
Fifty fuckin' cents?

564
01:02:50,872 --> 01:02:53,627
Kylie, it's Amos.
He's coming. He's got a gun.

565
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:57,343
- Shit. What do we do?
- I don't know. Get out the house. Hide.

566
01:03:58,649 --> 01:04:00,317
No.

567
01:08:24,316 --> 01:08:26,569
Just browsing, are ya?

568
01:08:28,191 --> 01:08:32,006
Give me your home address. Maybe I'll sniff
around your shit, see how you like it.

569
01:08:32,736 --> 01:08:35,693
- I know what you did.
- In relation to what?

570
01:08:35,798 --> 01:08:38,977
The girl next door,
the one you murdered.

571
01:08:40,464 --> 01:08:44,219
How did you come by that estimation?
From a few old newspapers?

572
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:48,984
And this.

573
01:08:52,289 --> 01:08:54,898
That hole in the door
was a nifty trick.

574
01:08:55,002 --> 01:08:57,926
Can't say the same about
your powers of deduction.

575
01:08:58,135 --> 01:08:59,909
Before you go around
accusing people of shit,

576
01:09:00,014 --> 01:09:01,370
you ought to get a handle
on some of the facts.

577
01:09:01,474 --> 01:09:03,839
Would that be something
you'd agree with?

578
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:06,378
More or less.

579
01:09:09,372 --> 01:09:11,736
Come. I'll show you something.

580
01:09:15,148 --> 01:09:18,686
The brooch belonged to my son Eugene.
When I say he was my son,

581
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:21,271
he wasn't my son by blood or
any other legitimate means.

582
01:09:21,376 --> 01:09:24,263
But I knew his mother, Joanie.

583
01:09:24,367 --> 01:09:28,195
And when I say I knew her, we had a certain
professional arrangement. You know?

584
01:09:28,299 --> 01:09:32,370
Anyway, she showed up at my
place one day with this young'un.

585
01:09:32,474 --> 01:09:37,762
Skinny as a rake. Huge black eyes.
Shivering half to death.

586
01:09:37,866 --> 01:09:40,963
I didn't know what they were running from,
but I knew that it couldn't be good.

587
01:09:41,067 --> 01:09:43,955
I told them they could stay at
my place as long as they needed.

588
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:46,426
She didn't even last the night.

589
01:09:47,332 --> 01:09:52,201
Now, I'm no Joe Doakes myself,
but this kid was really fucking strange.

590
01:09:52,306 --> 01:09:54,810
He never said more than three words,

591
01:09:54,914 --> 01:09:59,751
never looked you in the eye
and never ate off a plate.

592
01:09:59,856 --> 01:10:04,269
But he had a gift.
He loved mechanical stuff.

593
01:10:04,448 --> 01:10:06,779
Didn't matter whether it was
a motor or a circuit board.

594
01:10:06,884 --> 01:10:09,458
He'd figure out a way to make it go.

595
01:10:09,562 --> 01:10:12,902
And me being a bloke that had
a lot of stuff that needed fixing,

596
01:10:13,006 --> 01:10:16,486
I thought, shit,
maybe this could work out.

597
01:10:17,424 --> 01:10:20,800
Didn't matter whether it was
a car engine or a toastie oven,

598
01:10:20,904 --> 01:10:24,979
he'd pull it apart and
reassemble it again bit by bit,

599
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:28,725
sometimes adding his
own twist. "Eugenized."

600
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:33,464
That's what I used to call it.
I thought it was pretty funny,

601
01:10:33,569 --> 01:10:36,003
until one day I caught him
tearing the limbs off a moggy

602
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:38,820
to see if he could put
'em on backwards.

603
01:10:43,414 --> 01:10:45,920
I tried to set him straight,
but it wouldn't stick.

604
01:10:46,024 --> 01:10:49,608
The next time he strayed, I did the
only thing I felt equipped to do.

605
01:10:50,025 --> 01:10:52,043
Unfortunately, I was coming off
the back of a three-day bender

606
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:54,861
and I probably shouldn't
have used a tire chain.

607
01:10:55,695 --> 01:10:58,932
I actually thought I
killed the little bastard.

608
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,680
Next morning I come back to face
up to my sins and he was gone.

609
01:11:01,784 --> 01:11:04,253
That was the last I ever seen him.

610
01:11:04,566 --> 01:11:06,455
How long ago was this?

611
01:11:06,559 --> 01:11:09,855
About a year before that
young lady was killed.

612
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:16,014
A year's a long time. How do
you know he didn't leave town?

613
01:11:16,118 --> 01:11:19,001
There's something else you
should know about Eugene.

614
01:11:21,616 --> 01:11:24,740
And this makes his disappearance
a little hard to explain.

615
01:11:25,498 --> 01:11:28,629
He wasn't a fan of open spaces.

616
01:11:28,734 --> 01:11:30,627
What do you mean?

617
01:11:30,731 --> 01:11:35,253
Ten years he never went outside.
Barely left the house.

618
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:39,207
Can I take a look at his room?

619
01:11:42,943 --> 01:11:45,133
Go for your life.

620
01:13:23,253 --> 01:13:26,057
Well, hello there.

621
01:13:26,924 --> 01:13:33,196
You can record a message by pressing
the green button on my fanny pack.

622
01:14:20,588 --> 01:14:23,475
I can still see you.

623
01:14:28,957 --> 01:14:33,096
I tried to tell my mum about you.

624
01:14:33,305 --> 01:14:38,577
I said, "Mum, there's a man
who lives in the walls."

625
01:14:39,764 --> 01:14:44,658
I would never do that to my friend.

626
01:14:45,725 --> 01:14:49,104
Not if you tell me your name.

627
01:14:53,729 --> 01:14:57,156
Not if you tell me your name.

628
01:14:58,063 --> 01:15:00,165
Eugene.

629
01:17:40,345 --> 01:17:42,653
Jesus! Je...

630
01:18:33,485 --> 01:18:35,537
Kylie!

631
01:18:47,611 --> 01:18:50,922
Hello? Hello! Officer!

632
01:18:56,214 --> 01:18:58,746
- I thought you were on house arrest.
- Officer, you need to help me, please.

633
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:01,493
- Why? What's going on?
- We have to go back to my house.

634
01:19:01,598 --> 01:19:03,192
You just left the house,
and now you wanna go back?

635
01:19:03,296 --> 01:19:05,774
No, you don't understand.
My mum might be back by now.

636
01:19:05,878 --> 01:19:08,381
All right, all right. First thing we
need to do is make a statement.

637
01:19:08,486 --> 01:19:10,503
Now, what exactly
is this in relation to?

638
01:19:10,608 --> 01:19:13,461
I was vacuuming the house, and then
I put the vacuum back in the cupboard,

639
01:19:13,566 --> 01:19:16,523
and I saw that there was this
recess and it led to a secret room,

640
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:18,680
and there was this guy
in the walls, and he's pale.

641
01:19:18,784 --> 01:19:20,872
He's got black lips and a bung eye,
and he's fucking crazy.

642
01:19:20,976 --> 01:19:23,378
I swear to God, he tried to kill
me and that's why I took off.

643
01:19:23,482 --> 01:19:24,838
- Hold on, hold on.
- And then I couldn't...

644
01:19:24,943 --> 01:19:27,830
You're going too fast here. Okay.

645
01:19:27,934 --> 01:19:31,063
"Put vacuum cleaner...

646
01:19:31,483 --> 01:19:34,531
back in cupboard."

647
01:19:36,368 --> 01:19:38,637
And the rest is a blur.
What did you say?

648
01:20:03,457 --> 01:20:05,230
Kylie!

649
01:20:14,598 --> 01:20:17,666
Don't tell me to calm down!
Just listen to what I'm telling you!

650
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,818
There is a man living in the walls of
my house, and unless you do something,

651
01:20:20,923 --> 01:20:26,523
he's gonna kill my mum!
Just call my house, please! Please.

652
01:20:31,325 --> 01:20:35,117
Yeah. Hi. Can you put me
through to Probation Services?

653
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:36,579
God.

654
01:20:36,683 --> 01:20:38,214
- Amos.
- Are you okay?

655
01:20:38,318 --> 01:20:40,406
- This is gonna sound insane.
- I know. There's a guy in the walls.

656
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:43,222
She's telling the truth.
We have to get back to her place.

657
01:21:43,367 --> 01:21:45,128
This is bullshit.

658
01:21:47,492 --> 01:21:51,242
Look. You see that? That hole leads
to a passageway inside the walls.

659
01:21:51,346 --> 01:21:55,243
This explanis everything. There was
never any ghost or the noises.

660
01:21:55,347 --> 01:21:58,012
The power bills,
the stolen food... it was him.

661
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:02,853
Not that I'm trying to pick holes,

662
01:22:02,957 --> 01:22:05,750
but in the 15 years a deranged
killer spends hiding in the attic,

663
01:22:05,855 --> 01:22:07,802
you'd think he'd want to do
something a little more heinous

664
01:22:07,907 --> 01:22:11,282
- than steal food from the pantry.
- Maybe it was just a bad dream.

665
01:22:11,386 --> 01:22:13,787
It wasn't a dream.
Why can't you just fucking look?

666
01:22:13,891 --> 01:22:16,988
Kylie, we've searched the entire house.
We haven't found anything.

667
01:22:17,092 --> 01:22:19,944
Well, that's not entirely true.

668
01:22:24,224 --> 01:22:26,764
Kylie, it's the drugs you haven't
taken that concern me the most.

669
01:22:26,868 --> 01:22:27,982
What are you talking about?

670
01:22:28,086 --> 01:22:29,965
A year ago you were
diagnosed as bipolar.

671
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:32,401
Yeah, to get on the sickness benefit.
Everyone does it.

672
01:22:32,505 --> 01:22:34,106
Going off your medication
can be very dangerous.

673
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:36,541
Dennis, I think you'll find my
mental state is pretty sound

674
01:22:36,645 --> 01:22:39,324
compared to the maniac that's
living in our fucking walls!

675
01:22:39,428 --> 01:22:41,621
- Now, just listen for a moment...
- No, you listen. I'm not crazy.

676
01:22:41,725 --> 01:22:44,264
But I will be if you keep
trying to rationalize this.

677
01:22:44,368 --> 01:22:47,396
All you need to do is tear down that wall
and you'll see what I'm talking about.

678
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,458
- Well, we're not going to do that.
- Okay, if you won't then I will.

679
01:22:50,562 --> 01:22:52,545
Kylie, sit down.

680
01:22:54,295 --> 01:22:56,253
Sit down.

681
01:23:06,183 --> 01:23:09,524
I realize how difficult this is for you.
But if you can just imagine for a moment

682
01:23:09,628 --> 01:23:13,172
that the danger you think you're
in may not be as real as it seems.

683
01:23:14,983 --> 01:23:17,421
Are you familiar with the term
"dissociative identity disorder?"

684
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:20,622
- Oh, get fucked.
- Just hear him out, Kylie.

685
01:23:21,873 --> 01:23:24,206
- Do you ever lose track of time?
- No, I don't.

686
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:26,676
- Do you sometimes hear voices?
- This is ridiculous.

687
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:29,946
- What about your menstruating patterns?
- I beg your pardon?

688
01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:32,735
A hallmark of the disorder in
women is that each personality

689
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,601
has its own menstrual cycle.
This would mean that your periods

690
01:23:35,705 --> 01:23:38,818
- are more frequent than usual.
- Well, that explains a lot.

691
01:23:39,757 --> 01:23:42,228
When an incident occurs that we
don't feel equipped to deal with,

692
01:23:42,332 --> 01:23:44,628
the mind has the ability to
generate additional personalities.

693
01:23:44,733 --> 01:23:46,576
Yeah, I understand the
mechanics of it, shithead.

694
01:23:46,681 --> 01:23:49,707
I just don't understand how this is any
less retarded than what I'm suggesting.

695
01:23:49,812 --> 01:23:52,060
These hauntings, the blackouts,
the voice on the tape,

696
01:23:52,164 --> 01:23:54,616
- it's all just a coping device.
- To cope with what?

697
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:58,476
This. Being back in this house. The thought
of spending the next seven months

698
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:01,676
in the one place you've spent
your whole life trying to escape.

699
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:04,188
You've staged an elaborate
hoax to give credence

700
01:24:04,292 --> 01:24:05,921
to a delusion which is
starting to fall apart.

701
01:24:06,025 --> 01:24:09,468
If it's a delusion, how come I'm
not the only one that saw him?

702
01:24:13,435 --> 01:24:15,105
Tell him.

703
01:24:15,209 --> 01:24:18,688
It was years ago, Kylie.
I don't know what I saw.

704
01:24:35,841 --> 01:24:37,997
Get off me!

705
01:24:45,896 --> 01:24:48,089
Can I make a suggestion?

706
01:24:48,297 --> 01:24:52,646
I think perhaps it's time we
transferred Kylie to the clinic.

707
01:24:52,751 --> 01:24:56,299
She'd be under 24-hour supervision.
We'd have a much better chance

708
01:24:56,403 --> 01:24:59,308
of knowing if she stops
taking her medication.

709
01:25:01,446 --> 01:25:03,786
Perhaps that would be for the best.

710
01:25:04,574 --> 01:25:10,296
We have to try and present this in a way
that she... feels like it's her decision.

711
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:15,113
All right, I'll leave
Grayson here with you...

712
01:25:15,217 --> 01:25:17,868
in case she relapses.

713
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,906
Lovely.

714
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:36,449
Well, if there's anything to be
learned from the situation, Kylie,

715
01:25:36,553 --> 01:25:39,197
you need to be around
people your own age.

716
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:44,124
Oh! Oh! Oh, excuse me.

717
01:25:44,438 --> 01:25:46,886
And don't forget,
within a few months,

718
01:25:46,990 --> 01:25:49,948
we can look at applying
for approved absences.

719
01:25:50,052 --> 01:25:53,079
You won't feel quite so shut
out from the outside world.

720
01:25:53,183 --> 01:25:57,717
Of course friends and family can
come and visit any time as well.

721
01:25:57,821 --> 01:26:00,490
The facilities themselves,
they really are top-notch.

722
01:26:00,595 --> 01:26:03,447
The place is fully equipped with
a rumpus room, badminton court.

723
01:26:03,552 --> 01:26:05,778
There's even a Flying Fox.
It's dreadfully good fun.

724
01:26:05,882 --> 01:26:12,074
But the whole purpose of Tiaki Wairua...
is to promote a sense of independence.

725
01:26:12,806 --> 01:26:16,631
So, what do you think?
Would it be okay?

726
01:26:22,652 --> 01:26:26,514
- Yeah, I think it sounds great.
- Wonderful.

727
01:26:27,302 --> 01:26:29,245
Mum, can I talk to you
in private for a sec?

728
01:26:29,349 --> 01:26:31,331
What about?

729
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:36,394
Women's stuff.

730
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:47,111
The only person Eugene ever tried to harm
was Dennis. Why do you think that is?

731
01:26:47,215 --> 01:26:49,860
- I beg your pardon?
- Mum, he has a dental plate.

732
01:26:49,964 --> 01:26:51,912
Well, lots of people
have dental plates.

733
01:26:52,016 --> 01:26:53,930
What if he was a counselor
at Sunshine Grove?

734
01:26:54,035 --> 01:26:56,372
If Eugene was hiding in the
walls when Lizzy was killed,

735
01:26:56,477 --> 01:26:59,304
he would've seen him do it.
Do you see what this means?

736
01:26:59,409 --> 01:27:01,723
He wasn't trying to scare us.
He was trying to warn us.

737
01:27:01,828 --> 01:27:03,464
Kylie, we've been
through this before.

738
01:27:03,568 --> 01:27:06,003
- It's all in your head.
- That's what he wants us to think.

739
01:27:06,107 --> 01:27:09,517
So you're basing all this on the fact
that he's got one of his teeth missing?

740
01:27:09,621 --> 01:27:11,987
I can prove it. I just need
you to keep him in that room

741
01:27:12,091 --> 01:27:14,179
within eyeshot of the
cop until I get back.

742
01:27:14,283 --> 01:27:17,865
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Just do what you do best.

743
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,665
- Miriam, do you mind if I...
- So you live out at Shepherd Heights,

744
01:27:28,769 --> 01:27:31,818
- do you, Dennis?
- Yes, yes, that's right.

745
01:27:31,922 --> 01:27:33,349
Well, it's nice up there.

746
01:27:33,453 --> 01:27:36,237
Graeme and I sometimes go to
Sammy's on a Wednesday night

747
01:27:36,341 --> 01:27:39,046
for the all-you-can-eat buffet.
It's good value, isn't it?

748
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:42,568
- You must go there all the time, do you?
- No, not... not really.

749
01:27:42,673 --> 01:27:45,631
No, no. No, you wouldn't.
That's the thing about buffets.

750
01:27:45,735 --> 01:27:48,449
It's all the young kids. Sure, it's a
great place to throw birthday parties,

751
01:27:48,554 --> 01:27:52,657
but I wouldn't want your six-year-old's
fist in my crème brûlée, thanks very much.

752
01:28:20,492 --> 01:28:22,962
I said, "Go-Ann, how many
sick days have you got left?"

753
01:28:23,066 --> 01:28:25,085
She said, "I don't know. What is
sick day?" This is what she said.

754
01:28:25,189 --> 01:28:26,963
She's a wee Chinese girl.
You know what they're like.

755
01:28:27,067 --> 01:28:29,259
I said, "Your husband's lost
the use of both his legs.

756
01:28:29,363 --> 01:28:32,112
You're entitled to a bloody
sick day." "Oh, I'm not sure."

757
01:28:32,216 --> 01:28:34,966
- Poor thing. She didn't understand.
- Miriam, look, I'm sorry. I...

758
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:37,296
Maybe it's a cultural thing. I don't know.
But they're good wee workers.

759
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,556
Miriam!

760
01:28:43,802 --> 01:28:48,010
I need to use the bathroom, please.

761
01:29:18,802 --> 01:29:21,586
- What are you doing? Where is he?
- He said he had to go to the toilet.

762
01:29:21,691 --> 01:29:23,325
I told you not to let
him out of your sight.

763
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:26,352
Well, if a man's got to go,
he's got to go, doesn't he?

764
01:29:26,457 --> 01:29:29,691
There's not anything I
can do about it, is there?

765
01:29:35,294 --> 01:29:37,034
Where's the cop?

766
01:29:39,023 --> 01:29:41,799
I guess he had to go as well.

767
01:29:52,829 --> 01:29:55,193
Officer Grayson?

768
01:30:06,432 --> 01:30:09,112
Now, hang on a minute, Kylie.
Shouldn't we discuss this first?

769
01:30:09,216 --> 01:30:11,025
You can't accuse somebody
of murder over a cup of tea

770
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:13,426
and a biscuit, Mum.
It doesn't work like that.

771
01:30:13,634 --> 01:30:17,178
But do you really think waving a knife
around is gonna do us any favors?

772
01:30:17,805 --> 01:30:20,476
I don't know.
Let's see how it plays out.

773
01:31:01,681 --> 01:31:05,836
- Looking for something?
- I was just using the bathroom.

774
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:09,329
What's wrong with the one downstairs?

775
01:31:09,748 --> 01:31:12,072
I was hoping to be discreet.

776
01:31:12,386 --> 01:31:14,554
How did you know we
had a bathroom up here?

777
01:31:15,493 --> 01:31:16,263
What's all this about?

778
01:31:16,368 --> 01:31:17,861
We were just wondering if
maybe you worked here.

779
01:31:17,965 --> 01:31:20,922
- Could you let me ask the questions?
- Well, you're taking long enough.

780
01:31:21,235 --> 01:31:25,444
A year before Elizabeth Chalmers was
killed you came here on work experience.

781
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:29,097
First day on the job you get the shit
kicked out of you by a 15-year-old girl.

782
01:31:29,201 --> 01:31:34,341
That can't have been fun. Worst part
is you didn't even get paid for it.

783
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:38,420
Miriam, I think your
daughter's a little confused.

784
01:31:38,524 --> 01:31:43,570
No. No. I'm the one that's confused.
But I'm starting to get my head around it.

785
01:33:17,891 --> 01:33:22,856
Jesus, Kylie, he's got a
bloody corkscrew in his neck.

786
01:33:32,608 --> 01:33:33,956
What are you doing?

787
01:33:34,061 --> 01:33:36,749
Unless you can find anything else
we can use to defend ourselves,

788
01:33:36,853 --> 01:33:40,679
I'm afraid this is all we've got. Now,
would you please come give me a hand?

789
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:04,582
- Have you got any scissors?
- What for?

790
01:34:04,686 --> 01:34:07,955
If I can break the strap,
it'll send out a tamper signal.

791
01:34:14,462 --> 01:34:16,827
Well... Oh, yeah, okay.

792
01:34:28,518 --> 01:34:30,709
Go! Go! Go!

793
01:34:46,053 --> 01:34:47,202
Move your fat ass!

794
01:34:47,307 --> 01:34:50,506
I can't help it, Kylie.
I'm bottom heavy, all right?

795
01:36:10,006 --> 01:36:11,745
Amos. Thank God.

796
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:13,813
I got a tamper signal.
What happened to your face?

797
01:36:13,917 --> 01:36:18,322
It seems I've made a terrible mistake.
She was telling the truth. It was Eugene.

798
01:36:18,426 --> 01:36:22,079
He's killed Officer Grayson and
he's taken Kylie and Miriam,

799
01:36:22,183 --> 01:36:27,367
and I-I can't find them anywhere.
Oh, God, I'm such a fool.

800
01:36:34,589 --> 01:36:37,666
- What's that?
- It'll pick up Kylie's signal.

801
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:40,865
Here, you call the police.

802
01:36:50,156 --> 01:36:51,790
Amos!

803
01:36:57,288 --> 01:36:59,800
Amos, it's Dennis!

804
01:37:00,775 --> 01:37:02,645
Did you hear that?

805
01:37:19,381 --> 01:37:22,057
I need something to
wedge this open with.

806
01:37:26,409 --> 01:37:28,774
Nah, it's too thin.

807
01:37:28,879 --> 01:37:31,208
Give me something heavy.

808
01:38:41,547 --> 01:38:43,114
Fuck.

809
01:39:22,718 --> 01:39:24,729
What do you say?

810
01:39:25,049 --> 01:39:29,015
- What?
- Be nice to the man. Say thank you.

811
01:39:29,744 --> 01:39:34,094
- Whose do you think this is?
- I only take the little things.

812
01:39:36,529 --> 01:39:38,998
But I always give 'em back.

813
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:55,108
You're okay, sweetheart?

814
01:39:56,327 --> 01:39:58,691
- Do you need some help?
- I'm fine.

815
01:39:59,615 --> 01:40:03,400
You're as pale as a sheet.
You should drink some water.

816
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:07,528
- What? What is it?
- I don't know, but it's not fucking water.

817
01:40:15,114 --> 01:40:16,766
Is this funny, is it, mate?

818
01:40:19,355 --> 01:40:21,426
You seem to find this whole
situation quite amusing.

819
01:40:21,531 --> 01:40:23,220
Kylie, don't.

820
01:40:23,324 --> 01:40:28,091
Two people are dead. My leg's
been split open like a fucking bagel,

821
01:40:28,196 --> 01:40:31,778
and this bottom-feeding little
pissant thinks it's hysterical.

822
01:40:31,883 --> 01:40:33,960
He saw what happened to Elizabeth.

823
01:40:34,064 --> 01:40:36,136
You never tried to stop it.
You never called for help.

824
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:38,529
- You just sat there and watched.
- He doesn't mean us any harm.

825
01:40:38,633 --> 01:40:40,930
That doesn't change the fact
that he's a gutless maggot.

826
01:40:41,034 --> 01:40:41,942
- Kylie!
- What?

827
01:40:42,046 --> 01:40:44,896
You're always antagonizing people.
Just stop it.

828
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,514
I'm antagonizing? We wouldn't even
be in this shit if it wasn't for him.

829
01:40:48,618 --> 01:40:50,080
- You can't blame him.
- Why not?

830
01:40:50,184 --> 01:40:52,253
'Cause he's not right
in the head obviously.

831
01:40:52,758 --> 01:40:54,638
It's not gonna do us
any good to upset him.

832
01:40:54,742 --> 01:40:58,168
Oh, am I upsetting you, Eugene?
I'm sorry. I didn't realize...

833
01:41:21,474 --> 01:41:23,445
This me?

834
01:41:34,126 --> 01:41:37,012
- It's good.
- I've got other ones.

835
01:41:40,910 --> 01:41:43,519
That's you in the bathtub.

836
01:41:43,939 --> 01:41:46,047
Is there gonna be more
of these pictures?

837
01:41:46,152 --> 01:41:47,695
No.

838
01:41:50,001 --> 01:41:53,267
That's you on the
first day of school.

839
01:41:54,426 --> 01:41:57,520
That's you when you got expelled.

840
01:41:58,995 --> 01:42:02,895
That's you stealing Amarula
from the liquor cabinet.

841
01:42:04,048 --> 01:42:07,805
That's you being sick from
drinking too much Amarula.

842
01:42:09,749 --> 01:42:14,244
That's you punching your mum in
the face after she told you off.

843
01:42:14,984 --> 01:42:18,122
That's you not feeling
very good about it.

844
01:42:19,243 --> 01:42:23,005
That's you the day you went away.

845
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:28,509
And that's us waiting
for you to come back.

846
01:42:42,039 --> 01:42:44,092
Who's this one?

847
01:42:45,453 --> 01:42:47,468
Is this Lizzy?

848
01:42:53,259 --> 01:42:55,754
Why didn't you tell somebody?

849
01:43:00,235 --> 01:43:02,983
I thought they'd take me away.

850
01:43:06,463 --> 01:43:09,036
I thought they'd think I did it.

851
01:43:14,395 --> 01:43:17,144
I was only small, Kylie.

852
01:43:19,738 --> 01:43:21,930
I was only a kid.

853
01:43:29,113 --> 01:43:32,125
You have to help us, Eugene. Please.

854
01:43:33,582 --> 01:43:35,895
I know a place we can hide.

855
01:43:49,287 --> 01:43:51,072
Eugene...

856
01:44:06,131 --> 01:44:08,324
Now, see, this is a perfect example

857
01:44:08,428 --> 01:44:11,837
of what happens when we don't
discuss our problems openly.

858
01:44:12,030 --> 01:44:15,415
Is this how you work through
your problems, Dennis?

859
01:44:16,844 --> 01:44:19,816
I don't need you to tell
me what I did was wrong.

860
01:44:20,013 --> 01:44:22,725
And I'm not trying to make excuses.

861
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:27,792
But anyone who says there's
no such thing as a bad egg...

862
01:44:27,897 --> 01:44:30,921
obviously hasn't worked
in social services.

863
01:44:32,394 --> 01:44:35,043
All I ever wanted to
do was help people.

864
01:44:35,148 --> 01:44:38,069
But you've got no idea what it's
like to try and help someone...

865
01:44:38,174 --> 01:44:40,677
when all they want to do is
throw it back in your face.

866
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:58,001
Fuckin' hell.

867
01:46:36,522 --> 01:46:39,389
What shall I say? There's been
a murder? Attempted murder?

868
01:46:39,493 --> 01:46:42,794
- Look, do you want to talk to them?
- Why don't you just say...

869
01:46:44,536 --> 01:46:47,408
Just say something's come up and
you'll have to phone them back.

870
01:48:22,789 --> 01:48:26,757
All right, there she is,
looking very excited.

871
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:29,689
And here's Amos with the special...

872
01:48:29,793 --> 01:48:33,227
Oh. Is that all you do? You just
cut it off with a pair of scissors?

873
01:48:33,332 --> 01:48:35,211
- Yep.
- Oh. And then what do you do with it?

874
01:48:35,315 --> 01:48:39,593
Just chuck it in the rubbish.
Or we can keep it as a souvenir.

875
01:48:40,010 --> 01:48:42,327
- Did you hear that, Graeme?
- Eh?

876
01:48:42,431 --> 01:48:46,704
Amos was just saying to Kylie...
Oh, don't worry.

877
01:48:47,143 --> 01:48:50,136
- Okay, here we go.
- Oh, hold on.

878
01:48:51,267 --> 01:48:52,741
Why has it done that?

879
01:48:52,845 --> 01:48:55,042
- What?
- It's just turned itself off.

880
01:48:55,146 --> 01:48:57,268
It can't just turn off by itself.
You must've press something.

881
01:48:57,372 --> 01:49:00,191
- No, I didn't. I didn't press anything.
- Is the battery flat?

882
01:49:00,295 --> 01:49:03,796
Well, it shouldn't be.
It's been on the charger all night.

883
01:49:04,763 --> 01:49:06,063
Eugene!
