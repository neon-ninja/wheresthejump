1
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:01,751
Daddy...

2
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:05,501
Kimberly.

3
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,667
Daddy, where's the car?

4
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:43,709
Mama?

5
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:37,709
Father Brian?

6
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:40,417
Sorry to disturb.

7
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:43,251
Yes of course.
Come in, Katherine.

8
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:47,751
Sit down.

9
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:49,834
Thank you Dawn.

10
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:55,251
Mr. Walch tells me your recital's

11
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:59,292
coming along very, very nicely.
Sorry I won't be around to see it,

12
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:04,901
But I'm sure that you'll enjoy performing for your
friends and your parents all the same, won't you?

13
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:06,667
Where are you going?

14
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,917
I have some personal business in Albany.

15
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:15,126
How long does it take to get to Albany?

16
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:19,876
Oh... couple of hours... by train.

17
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:26,126
So about the same exact time to
come back then, I guess... huh?

18
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,501
Katherine...

19
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,751
are you concerned about something?

20
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:45,042
I mean just wish you could
stay and see my performance.

21
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:46,876
That's all.

22
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:52,001
Well, I'm sorry but this time
it just can't be helped.

23
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:58,167
When do you come back?

24
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:02,292
After the break...

25
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:06,042
with everyone else, I should imagine.

26
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:22,251
Is something funny?

27
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,626
Funny?

28
00:04:30,126 --> 00:04:32,376
No.
Why?

29
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:36,042
You smiled a little.

30
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,459
I did?

31
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,292
Yes you did.

32
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,917
I was just thinking to say I hope
you have a fun time in Albany.

33
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,792
Headache, you say?

34
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:45,667
And my throat kinda hurts when I swallow.

35
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:48,292
You poor thing...

36
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:51,834
It would be a shame to
be sick over the break.

37
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:53,042
I know...

38
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:57,334
Here you are, dear.

39
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:11,501
So you really think I should tell him?

40
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,751
Rose, of course you have to tell him!

41
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:17,834
It's like half his.
It's half his problem anyway.

42
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:20,042
No it isn't.
Not really.

43
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,542
Well it should be.

44
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:25,209
He's the one who got you in this
situation in the first place.

45
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:27,126
He knew exactly what he was doing.

46
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:29,876
Like I didn't?
He was doing it to me.

47
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:32,417
And I was liking it.

48
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:37,667
Don't laugh.
It's so not funny.

49
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:42,209
Besides it's only been four days.

50
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:43,626
I could still get it.

51
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:46,834
You think you're going
to tell your parents?

52
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:55,709
Of course, everyone is excited
to have your parents come and

53
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:59,001
tour the classrooms and share your life

54
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:00,959
here at Bramford with them.

55
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,501
But that doesn't mean

56
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:07,084
there's going to be any change when
when it comes to con-duct ex-pec-ta-tions.

57
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:11,876
If anything, conduct is more
important today than any other day

58
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:16,917
because today we are all here
today representing Bramford.

59
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:21,542
And that means that you are representing
all the young women who came before you

60
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,209
and all the women who will follow you

61
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:25,959
after you've moved on.

62
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:29,167
Sound good?

63
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:31,667
Sounds good...

64
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:35,126
And if I don't see you before you
leave, have a great week off

65
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:37,376
We'll see you on the...

66
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:32,334
Rose!

67
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:34,792
Where are you going?

68
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,334
I was gonna check out
some of the performance.

69
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:39,751
You okay?

70
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,292
Yeah, of course

71
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:43,834
Where are your parents?

72
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,709
They're waiting inside
so I better go.

73
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:51,876
Okay, well... I'll see you
next week then, okay?

74
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:21,709
Katherine...

75
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:24,001
Have you checked your cellular phone?

76
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:25,751
Maybe they called you there.

77
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:28,584
I don't have one yet.

78
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:31,876
They said maybe for my birthday.

79
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:40,167
You know, bad weather coming in
all over the east coast an'

80
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,126
maybe they got caught up in that.

81
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,459
Planes get delayed.

82
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:47,626
And Rose, what about you?

83
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:52,292
I thought we got out on Friday so
I told my parents to come on Friday.

84
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,417
Guess I spaced out.

85
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:58,626
Were you able to reach them?

86
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:02,959
Yeah... it just may take a day or so
to change their plans.

87
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,459
- A day?
- Yeah, 'cause they're...

88
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,417
planning on coming
on Friday so they'll

89
00:12:08,584 --> 00:12:10,417
probably still come on Friday.

90
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:15,501
All right, well... Miss Prescott
and Miss Drake

91
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:18,376
will be here in any case.
Now do you hear that, Katherine?

92
00:12:19,084 --> 00:12:22,209
It happens that parents get confused and

93
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:25,751
Worst case is they come on Friday
and everyone goes home

94
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:28,417
and has a really nice break anyway

95
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,876
After all... we can't let you live here.

96
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:36,501
Rose, Would you look after Kat

97
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:38,292
until her parents arrive?

98
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:42,042
I actually haven't been feeling very well.

99
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:46,792
I have a really sore throat.
I was gonna stay in bed

100
00:12:58,001 --> 00:12:59,042
Uh, Miss Prescott,

101
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:03,001
You will call Mr Cornish

102
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:06,626
in a few hours, both on his home
phone and his mobile

103
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:09,501
- Won't you?
- Of course we will.

104
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:11,751
Sound good?

105
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:16,376
Katherine?

106
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:19,376
Sounds good.

107
00:13:24,126 --> 00:13:25,667
Hey... dad.

108
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:30,292
It's me.

109
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,292
Just calling to see where
you and mom were...

110
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:37,542
if you're coming...

111
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:43,042
I guess you could call the school.

112
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,001
Dear Lord,

113
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:37,126
Thank you for this meal that
you have placed in front of us

114
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,459
on this night.

115
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:50,324
You know I'm not babysitting
you tonight right, Freshman?

116
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:55,042
Mr Gordon said you were
supposed to stay with me.

117
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:59,959
Yeah but what's he gonna do, bust me
for not being in school over vacation?

118
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:01,126
Mr Gordon said that...

119
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:04,501
"Mr Gordon said... Mr Gordon said"

120
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,334
What are you, a freaking recording?

121
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,542
- Where are you going?
- Me?

122
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,292
Nowhere

123
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:17,126
And if the sisters say anything, just tell them
I wasn't feeling well so I'm staying in bed.

124
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:21,084
You do know about the sisters, don't you?

125
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:23,209
Know what?

126
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,292
You know they wear wigs, right?

127
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,292
You know they have no hair on their bodies?

128
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:33,751
No hair anywhere

129
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,751
Next time, check their eyebrows.

130
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:41,376
Totally fake.

131
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:46,126
The real ones... burned right off.

132
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:47,876
That's not true.

133
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:51,001
You didn't hear about Jen Darling's sister?

134
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,334
Graduated three years ago.

135
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:57,459
She walked in on them one night...

136
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,292
worshipping the Devil.

137
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,167
Who told you?

138
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:20,251
Don't come in my room, okay?

139
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:24,084
And don't touch my shit.

140
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:33,209
Th... uh, there's someone in here.

141
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:10,626
<i>I'm sorry. The number you have dialled has
been disconnected or is no longer in service.</i>

142
00:21:14,126 --> 00:21:15,334
Are you okay?

143
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:19,934
You can't be warm enough in that jacket.

144
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,042
Are you waiting for someone?

145
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:32,409
Can we give you a lift somewhere?
You gotta be freezing.

146
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,459
Where are you heading?

147
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:40,751
We're gonna get back on the highway and
then we're gonna head east a little while.

148
00:21:41,876 --> 00:21:43,542
How 'bout you, you heading someplace?

149
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:49,167
- Portsmith.
- Sure, I know Portsmith.

150
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:52,893
I'm parked right over there. My
wife's waiting in the car

151
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:54,417
See? Right there.

152
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:00,542
My name's Bill.

153
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:02,209
What's your name?

154
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:04,667
Joan.

155
00:22:05,584 --> 00:22:06,792
My name's Joan.

156
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:10,834
Nice, nice name.

157
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,667
Bill, what're you doing?

158
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:18,417
Just trying to help.

159
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:21,834
C'mon.

160
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,459
We'll take her to the next gas station.

161
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:45,792
I'm trying to help.

162
00:23:41,584 --> 00:23:42,792
Call me later okay?

163
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:45,959
I don't have my phone.

164
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:51,126
So that's it?

165
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:54,126
Stop saying that.

166
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,459
What am I supposed to say?

167
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:01,792
Nothing.

168
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:08,542
I'll take care of it.

169
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,042
Can you at least let me drive you there?

170
00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:14,417
No... no way

171
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:19,167
Careful, OK?

172
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:25,667
Careful...
Yeah, right.

173
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:30,334
Idiot!

174
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:46,917
Katherine?

175
00:31:58,834 --> 00:31:59,834
It's Bill.

176
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:03,417
From the bus station.

177
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:07,709
Do you mind if I come in?

178
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:30,167
Just wanted to see how you're doing.

179
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:34,959
I see you're up at least.

180
00:32:58,001 --> 00:32:59,084
So...

181
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:03,459
I guess you're pretty
zonked out there, huh?

182
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,501
You slept for four hours in the backseat.

183
00:33:09,084 --> 00:33:10,126
I'm sorry.

184
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:11,334
For what?

185
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:16,792
First rule,

186
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:19,709
you don't apologise to me, young lady.

187
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:22,376
I'm happy to help, okay?

188
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,542
I'm sorry...

189
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:27,084
It's okay.

190
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:32,709
Why are you doing this?

191
00:33:34,334 --> 00:33:35,334
Doing what?

192
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:37,542
Helping me so much?

193
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:44,376
Do you believe in God, Joan?

194
00:33:49,209 --> 00:33:51,167
No? Just like that?

195
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,334
Ever try to look for him?

196
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,001
It's strange.

197
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:11,917
People think you look for Him
in some book, or a church or

198
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,334
a statue

199
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:17,042
maybe even a candle flame.

200
00:34:20,042 --> 00:34:21,792
But that's not how it works for me.

201
00:34:24,126 --> 00:34:27,042
I look for Him in the
unlikely things that happen.

202
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:30,042
Little coïncidences.

203
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:34,667
When I saw you sitting
at that bus station,

204
00:34:37,334 --> 00:34:39,251
You reminded me so much
of someone...

205
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,917
someone I haven't seen
in a long time...

206
00:34:47,959 --> 00:34:50,667
And then, when you said you
were going to Portsmith...

207
00:34:51,251 --> 00:34:55,501
Well... a coincidence like that
I just can't ignore it.

208
00:34:59,251 --> 00:35:01,959
So strange as it may sound,

209
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:06,042
I guess I saw God in you.

210
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:15,292
Are you going to Portsmith too?

211
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:17,542
No, not exactly.

212
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,959
Linda and I are headed
to the town just before it...

213
00:35:22,334 --> 00:35:23,501
We're going to Bramford.

214
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,251
Do you know Bramford?

215
00:35:44,084 --> 00:35:45,084
What's that?

216
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:47,376
When do we leave?

217
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,084
What's your hurry?

218
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:58,626
Where's your wife?

219
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:03,501
She's sleeping.

220
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,001
Why?

221
00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:23,251
Well, hopefully we can...

222
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:25,792
get out of here first thing
in the morning.

223
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:29,042
I, uh... bet you're pretty hungry.

224
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:33,376
There's a restaurant next door.

225
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:36,084
Why don't you get dressed,
come down and have some dinner.

226
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:14,501
You know how much trouble
I could get into for this?

227
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:27,959
Do you need a towel?

228
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:38,167
So what were you doing down there?

229
00:37:47,876 --> 00:37:49,251
Were you sleepwalking?

230
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:53,001
Do you sleepwalk, is that
what that was?

231
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:04,126
What about your parents?

232
00:38:04,876 --> 00:38:06,084
Did they call?

233
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,251
They're not going to call.

234
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:28,709
They just got confused.

235
00:38:29,459 --> 00:38:30,459
Like your parents?

236
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:34,001
But your parents didn't get confused.

237
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:37,667
You told them not to come
so you could go out on a date.

238
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:42,959
- It wasn't a date.
- It wasn't?

239
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,126
- No, it wasn't.
- What was it?

240
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:48,251
Nothing.

241
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:54,792
Mr Gordon said you were
supposed to look after me.

242
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:05,334
I know what Mr Gordon said.

243
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:08,542
Mr Gordon said worst case they'd
be here by Friday.

244
00:39:08,876 --> 00:39:11,167
- Yeah, I know what he said...
- And now it's too late.

245
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:13,084
Too late for what?

246
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:16,542
They're dead.

247
00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:31,626
That is an awful thing to say.

248
00:39:34,084 --> 00:39:35,626
You shouldn't say things like that.

249
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,876
You shouldn't say things like that,
okay? It's just not funny.

250
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:54,167
You smell pretty...

251
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:00,542
You should go to bed.

252
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,827
Just go to bed, then when you wake up
in the morning...

253
00:40:06,126 --> 00:40:08,959
you're gonna be okay, alright?

254
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:13,167
They'll be here on Friday.
They're already on their way.

255
00:40:13,334 --> 00:40:14,709
That's it. OK?

256
00:40:16,126 --> 00:40:17,292
That's it.

257
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:22,751
You should go to bed now.

258
00:40:24,459 --> 00:40:26,084
Is there anything else I can get you?

259
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:30,584
No, you had your chance.

260
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:42,667
There she is

261
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:46,209
Linda has an extra coat.
It's a lot warmer than yours.

262
00:41:46,376 --> 00:41:47,876
She won't mind if you borrow it.

263
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:49,584
She's gonna be along any minute.

264
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,334
So... Portsmith, huh?

265
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:56,459
Is that your home?

266
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:58,251
Your mom and dad?

267
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:04,251
No... friends? Someone?

268
00:42:06,459 --> 00:42:09,126
- Someone.
- That's better than having no one, isn't it?

269
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:14,126
They changed the decor of
this place a few years ago.

270
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:18,167
Used to be more of a kid's place,

271
00:42:18,334 --> 00:42:21,001
famous for their chicken noodle soup.

272
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:23,459
That's how we came by it anyway.

273
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:26,306
Linda and I used to, uh, spend a lot
of time here with our daughter.

274
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:32,792
Remember I told you that you,
uh, remind me of somebody?

275
00:42:36,876 --> 00:42:39,876
You reminded me of her... my daughter.

276
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:44,084
She'd be right about your age by now.

277
00:42:47,126 --> 00:42:48,834
We lost her nine years ago.

278
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:51,667
Nine years, uh...

279
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:54,501
tomorrow, actually.

280
00:42:56,417 --> 00:42:58,167
And it's okay, we do okay...

281
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:00,751
It's difficult but uh...

282
00:43:01,751 --> 00:43:03,959
You know what they say,
time heals all wounds.

283
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:07,751
And little by little it does
get easier, except...

284
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:11,209
around this time of year when
we go and lay flowers...

285
00:43:11,376 --> 00:43:12,542
on the anniversary.

286
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:17,542
I've got a picture.

287
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,667
That's my Rose.

288
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:53,917
She's pretty.

289
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:56,876
Yes she is, isn't she?

290
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:03,751
Have you decided?

291
00:44:03,792 --> 00:44:05,709
Oh, uh, yes I've decided.

292
00:44:06,501 --> 00:44:09,042
- Joan, you decided?
- Excuse me.

293
00:45:13,084 --> 00:45:14,959
Oh, there you are.

294
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:18,501
Look, we've got some, uh, really
bad weather coming in overnight.

295
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:22,126
And if we don't get on the road tonight,
we're gonna be snowed in tomorrow,

296
00:45:22,292 --> 00:45:24,126
maybe the day after.

297
00:45:25,084 --> 00:45:28,484
They're gonna pack up our food for us, so why
don't you grab it and meet me out front?

298
00:45:58,917 --> 00:46:00,892
What did he tell you?

299
00:46:06,084 --> 00:46:07,934
Did he tell you about our daughter?

300
00:46:16,084 --> 00:46:18,501
When he told you about
our daughter he said,

301
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:22,084
HAVE, didn't he?

302
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:30,251
"We HAVE a daughter."

303
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:41,459
He told you, you remind
him of her.

304
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:48,626
He actually said that to you,
didn't he?

305
00:46:53,626 --> 00:46:56,417
It's okay, poor thing...

306
00:46:56,876 --> 00:46:59,376
He tries to say that to everyone.

307
00:47:01,376 --> 00:47:03,084
Of course, I never see it.

308
00:47:04,334 --> 00:47:06,084
Of course it isn't true.

309
00:47:12,459 --> 00:47:16,001
But still sometimes I try.

310
00:47:19,334 --> 00:47:21,209
I saw it once,

311
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:26,542
I was at the supermarket alone.

312
00:47:27,459 --> 00:47:32,126
And I was standing in the middle
of a long aisle all by myself.

313
00:47:35,376 --> 00:47:37,292
And a girl came 'round the corner.

314
00:47:39,917 --> 00:47:42,376
She was looking on a low
shelf for something.

315
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:44,959
She's about 15.

316
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:51,584
And she had her money held
tightly in her hand

317
00:47:51,751 --> 00:47:53,417
like children do.

318
00:47:57,459 --> 00:47:59,667
I guess school had gone back already.

319
00:48:02,042 --> 00:48:03,876
- (Indecipherable) -

320
00:48:04,626 --> 00:48:08,709
She was just in her uniform, skirt...

321
00:48:08,876 --> 00:48:11,292
sneakers... with no socks.

322
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:14,042
Her knees were pink,

323
00:48:15,751 --> 00:48:17,917
It was red from the cold.

324
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:20,126
But what did she know?

325
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:26,292
She had her hair in a ponytail

326
00:48:27,376 --> 00:48:30,792
and I could see the roots being
pulled back from her ears.

327
00:48:52,417 --> 00:48:54,042
You don't look anything like her.

328
00:48:59,959 --> 00:49:01,334
It's strange.

329
00:49:02,459 --> 00:49:04,334
I can't see you at all.

330
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:20,917
Well what did they say?

331
00:50:27,626 --> 00:50:28,917
What did they say?

332
00:50:29,751 --> 00:50:30,959
He said it's all right.

333
00:50:31,292 --> 00:50:32,959
Wait, what's all right?
Who says?

334
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:36,001
He says I can't live here,

335
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,626
but I can... with him.

336
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:42,042
Who's he?

337
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:44,792
You know who.

338
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,042
No, I don't know.

339
00:50:47,459 --> 00:50:49,126
Mr Gordon

340
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:50,709
Silly...

341
00:50:51,459 --> 00:50:53,126
He's the headmaster.

342
00:51:07,459 --> 00:51:09,084
You smell pretty...

343
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:38,542
Dear Lord...

344
00:51:39,084 --> 00:51:42,126
Thank you for this meal that you have
placed in front of us on this day.

345
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:44,501
Katherine...

346
00:51:50,876 --> 00:51:51,876
Yes, ma'am?

347
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:54,751
Is there something wrong?

348
00:51:56,542 --> 00:51:57,542
No, ma'am.

349
00:51:59,751 --> 00:52:01,334
In that case,

350
00:52:02,209 --> 00:52:05,376
kindly repeat Grace for
the rest of us.

351
00:52:15,417 --> 00:52:16,751
Dear Lord...

352
00:52:18,751 --> 00:52:23,584
Thank you for this meal that you've
place in front of us that...

353
00:52:25,959 --> 00:52:27,334
and for which we're truly...

354
00:52:27,501 --> 00:52:28,501
Katherine!

355
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,501
Mercy!

356
00:52:57,959 --> 00:52:59,417
Is she okay?

357
00:53:06,126 --> 00:53:07,709
She's fine.

358
00:53:10,126 --> 00:53:11,542
Did Mr Gordon call?

359
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:14,751
Why on earth would the
headmaster call here?

360
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:17,834
I don't know... just...

361
00:53:18,001 --> 00:53:20,459
To see if they were all right?
Her parents?

362
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:22,709
Of course they are all right.

363
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:26,251
And Katherine is all right as well.

364
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:31,042
Thank you, Miss Drake.

365
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:32,876
Drink this, dear.

366
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:37,584
Katherine...

367
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:42,292
Get your hands off me, cunt.

368
00:53:55,209 --> 00:53:57,084
Miss Drake, the telephone please!

369
00:53:58,542 --> 00:53:59,876
Certainly, dear.

370
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:10,917
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

371
00:54:12,084 --> 00:54:14,751
You will look at me when
I am talking to you!

372
00:54:15,834 --> 00:54:16,834
Miss Prescott?

373
00:54:17,126 --> 00:54:18,167
A word, please.

374
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:25,167
He really did say he'd come.

375
00:54:28,334 --> 00:54:30,459
He'll come and he'll say he was wrong.

376
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:35,667
This time he'll say that
I can live here.

377
00:54:36,709 --> 00:54:38,501
He's the headmaster...

378
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,834
Rose, uh, come out here please.

379
00:54:58,876 --> 00:55:02,542
I'm kindly asking... to shovel
the path between the houses

380
00:55:03,876 --> 00:55:05,959
Shovel it down to the earth.

381
00:55:06,126 --> 00:55:08,376
Me?
Why me?

382
00:55:08,876 --> 00:55:10,251
What did I do?

383
00:55:10,417 --> 00:55:13,292
Mr Gordon will be arriving
this afternoon.

384
00:55:15,626 --> 00:55:17,126
Mr Gordon...

385
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:20,834
What happened?

386
00:55:23,084 --> 00:55:26,667
Down to the earth... please.

387
00:58:11,709 --> 00:58:14,876
- You alright?
- Uh, yes.

388
00:58:15,209 --> 00:58:17,042
They should be over this way.

389
00:59:11,709 --> 00:59:13,126
Miss Prescott?

390
01:01:05,376 --> 01:01:06,376
Mommy?

391
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:10,292
Dad?

392
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:15,792
<i>Hi, baby girl.</i>

393
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:22,667
Dad?

394
01:01:24,459 --> 01:01:25,834
<i>Katherine...</i>

395
01:01:30,917 --> 01:01:32,751
Wh-Who is it?

396
01:01:42,459 --> 01:01:44,626
<i>They're not coming.</i>

397
01:01:46,917 --> 01:01:49,917
<i>Kill all the cunts.</i>

398
01:03:24,042 --> 01:03:25,917
<i>They're wigs, right?</i>

399
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:30,917
<i>You know that they have no hair
on their bodies?</i>

400
01:03:32,459 --> 01:03:34,376
<i>No hair anywhere?</i>

401
01:03:36,084 --> 01:03:38,376
<i>Next time check their eyebrows.</i>

402
01:03:39,084 --> 01:03:40,501
<i>Totally fake.</i>

403
01:03:41,709 --> 01:03:45,626
<i>The real ones... burned right off.</i>

404
01:03:46,959 --> 01:03:49,584
<i>You didn't hear about
Jen Darling's sister?</i>

405
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:52,251
<i>Graduated three years ago.</i>

406
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:56,376
<i>She walked in on them one night...</i>

407
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:01,917
<i>worshipping the Devil.</i>

408
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:16,542
<i>You can stay here with me...</i>

409
01:05:23,334 --> 01:05:25,292
<i>long time...</i>

410
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:34,417
<i>(Indecipherable)</i>

411
01:08:31,834 --> 01:08:35,042
Oh my god... oh my god.

412
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:52,584
Katherine?

413
01:14:22,517 --> 01:14:23,551
Oh Jesus...

414
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:33,042
Hey, drop it!

415
01:14:44,417 --> 01:14:46,667
Hey drop... drop it...

416
01:14:58,876 --> 01:15:01,626
Drop it!
Drop the knife!

417
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,526
Drop the knife, goddammit! This is your
last warning! I will shoot you!

418
01:15:16,792 --> 01:15:18,126
DROP THE KNIFE!!

419
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:29,376
I have Satan...

420
01:15:32,542 --> 01:15:33,667
I have Satan...

421
01:15:33,834 --> 01:15:35,417
I SAID DROP THE KNIFE!

422
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:23,209
Did you tell her?

423
01:16:24,292 --> 01:16:25,751
Did you tell her all about it?

424
01:16:26,251 --> 01:16:27,334
I told her.

425
01:16:30,459 --> 01:16:33,542
When you meet these people,
do you say to them...

426
01:16:34,584 --> 01:16:35,959
do you say that she was murdered?

427
01:16:36,126 --> 01:16:37,376
Please!

428
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:39,167
No, you don't.

429
01:16:39,417 --> 01:16:40,834
You don't say

430
01:16:41,251 --> 01:16:42,292
that when she was found,

431
01:16:42,459 --> 01:16:43,917
they had to do a blood test

432
01:16:44,084 --> 01:16:45,584
to see if her head matched the body.

433
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:46,417
That's enough!

434
01:16:46,584 --> 01:16:48,834
Just focus on the road!

435
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:51,084
Don't touch me!

436
01:17:19,792 --> 01:17:21,042
Can you please pull over?

437
01:17:22,059 --> 01:17:23,334
Huh? What was that?

438
01:17:24,501 --> 01:17:25,626
I think I'm gonna be sick.

439
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:27,292
Are you alright back there?

440
01:17:27,751 --> 01:17:28,751
Please, pull over.

441
01:17:29,109 --> 01:17:32,917
Alright, hold on. Hold on.

442
01:17:33,042 --> 01:17:35,934
Bill, please. Just go past it.
We're not stopping.

443
01:17:36,076 --> 01:17:37,542
Hold on, hold on.

444
01:17:37,751 --> 01:17:39,292
Goddammit Bill, don't stop here!

445
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:42,167
Okay... here we go.

446
01:21:46,792 --> 01:21:48,251
Katherine?

447
01:22:09,167 --> 01:22:10,376
There you are.

448
01:22:17,292 --> 01:22:19,126
You are not wanted here.

449
01:22:23,709 --> 01:22:26,751
I say, you will go from this place.

450
01:22:29,334 --> 01:22:30,834
You will leave here.

451
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:40,876
<i>You will leave this poor girl...</i>

452
01:22:42,084 --> 01:22:44,542
<i>and you will never come back</i>

453
01:24:11,709 --> 01:24:13,376
I command that you leave this place.

454
01:24:16,667 --> 01:24:18,709
I command that you go out!

455
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:22,209
I command that you go out!

456
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:26,334
By the power of Christ!

457
01:24:26,751 --> 01:24:27,751
I command you!

458
01:24:28,584 --> 01:24:31,042
I command you to leave this girl!

459
01:24:31,626 --> 01:24:33,626
And never come back!

460
01:24:36,667 --> 01:24:38,167
I command you to go out!

461
01:24:55,251 --> 01:24:56,459
Don't go.
