1
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:54,282
Hi. I'm Elise.
You must be Lorraine.

2
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:57,619
Yes. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry it's so late.

3
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:00,830
My dayjob kind of makes
raising my son a nightjob.

4
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:02,248
Don't worry about it.

5
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:06,127
In my line of work, things tend
to happen when it gets dark.

6
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:07,545
Please.
Thank you.

7
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:16,721
Ahoy, Carl!

8
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:20,642
Elise, thank you for coming.

9
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:24,145
I didn't know what else
to do, except call you.

10
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:25,939
Oh, I understand.

11
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:27,816
You had a big problem
and you thought

12
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:30,151
you'd make it my problem, too.
Is that it?

13
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:32,654
Uh, uh...

14
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:34,489
I'm teasing.

15
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:37,408
You know I'm always
happy to help, Carl.

16
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:39,410
Would you like
some coffee or tea?

17
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:41,329
No, thank you.

18
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,998
I'd like to get started
right away, if that's okay.

19
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:45,625
Carl told me on the phone

20
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,336
your son is the one
affected, is that right?

21
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,838
Yes, that's right.

22
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,422
My son, Josh.

23
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,300
Something is following him.

24
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,887
Show her.

25
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:02,559
I started with
all the usual checks,

26
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:04,978
mental health tests,
medical records.

27
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:06,646
Everything normal.

28
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:09,899
Then I saw the photos.

29
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:14,195
First noticed it
about six weeks ago.

30
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,698
Thought it was
a camera problem.

31
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:19,701
Then it became apparent
that it was more than that.

32
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:22,871
I interviewed the boy.

33
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:25,748
He won't tell me anything.
He's afraid.

34
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,460
I'm afraid, too.

35
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:32,839
There's something in this house.
I can feel it.

36
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:35,091
It doesn't want me here.

37
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:56,613
May I meet him?

38
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:01,743
<i>Hi, Josh. I'm Elise.</i>

39
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:04,537
<i>I would love to ask you
some simple questions.</i>

40
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,748
<i>Do you like living here?</i>

41
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:08,917
Yeah, I guess.

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,794
Are there a lot of kids your
age in this neighborhood?

43
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,590
<i>A few.
One kid lives next door.</i>

44
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,300
That must be fun.

45
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:22,221
Is there anything you don't like
about living in this house?

46
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,812
<i>I have bad dreams sometimes.</i>

47
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,190
What happens in your dreams?

48
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:39,113
I'd like to try something
with you, Josh.

49
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:42,158
And I promise, it won't hurt.

50
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,707
I want you to just relax.

51
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,419
Listen to the ticking.

52
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:54,963
Focus on it.

53
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:57,048
Tune everything else out.

54
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,593
Feel yourself getting sleepier.

55
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,723
We are now inside
your dream, Josh.

56
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,184
Look around.

57
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,769
What do you see?

58
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:14,357
I see myself

59
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,360
sleeping in bed.

60
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,404
Are you in your bedroom?

61
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:22,281
No.

62
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:24,242
I'm somewhere dark.

63
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:26,661
It's always dark here.

64
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,538
Are you alone?

65
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:31,249
No.

66
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,626
She's here.

67
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,128
Who is "she"?

68
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:38,381
She says she's a friend.

69
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,718
She visits me every night.

70
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,430
Where is she
right at this moment?

71
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,599
Is she here in
this house with us?

72
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,894
I'd like to talk to her.

73
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:05,408
Okay, we're gonna play
a little game, Josh.

74
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,452
It's called Hot and Cold.

75
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:09,996
<i>I'll walk around the house,</i>

76
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,042
<i>and you tell me if I'm
getting warmer or colder.</i>

77
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,471
Cold.

78
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:43,154
Warm.

79
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:05,843
<i>Warmer.</i>

80
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,190
Colder.

81
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,592
<i>Getting warm.</i>

82
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,310
Hotter.

83
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,233
It's very hot.

84
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,000
Please get out of there.

85
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,547
Who are you?

86
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:27,300
What do you want?

87
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:48,029
What happened?

88
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:50,198
I saw what haunts him,
and it's not a friend.

89
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:54,118
It's a parasite. I've never
felt such a malignant presence.

90
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:56,162
It wants to be him.

91
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:57,580
Miss Lambert,

92
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:01,250
I think your son has a
unique ability, a gift.

93
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:05,171
When he sleeps at night, he's
able to go places, see things.

94
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,716
Things no living person
is supposed to see.

95
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:13,387
Only now, one of the
dead has seen him, too.

96
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,348
Oh, my God.

97
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,476
Well, can you stop it?

98
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:21,896
I could take away his gift

99
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,440
to suppress his memory
of his ability.

100
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,858
How would we do that?

101
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,033
I'll show you.

102
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,402
Do whatever you have to.
Make him forget.

103
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,688
One morning, Dalton
just wouldn't wake up.

104
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,483
We took him to the best
doctors we could find,

105
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:57,278
but none of them had any idea.

106
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:01,574
Eventually,
we just took him home,

107
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,701
still in his coma.

108
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:08,080
Then things started
happening around the house.

109
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:10,624
Unexplained things.

110
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,294
I got so freaked out, we moved.

111
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,379
But they kept happening.

112
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:21,302
And you believe that there was
some sort of supernatural force at work?

113
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:26,265
When did you hire the services

114
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,350
of the deceased Elise Rainier?

115
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,396
When we ran out
of places to go.

116
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,317
It says in your
statement, Mrs. Lambert,

117
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,321
that last night, at
approximately 10:00 p.m.,

118
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:44,283
Elise put your husband
into a state of hypnosis.

119
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,161
She did this as
part of a ritual that

120
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,831
she believed would allow him to

121
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:56,170
"project his unconscious
into a..." Uh...

122
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:59,381
I'm sorry, I can't read
my own handwriting.

123
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:04,345
"...Into a spirit realm, where
he could locate your son

124
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:08,015
"and bring him back
to consciousness."

125
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:14,939
Now, did you really
believe that would help?

126
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,860
I had to. Whatever she
did, it worked.

127
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:21,779
Dalton woke up.

128
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:25,449
And what happened
after your son woke up?

129
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,913
RENAII Josh!

130
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,833
Josh, where are you?

131
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:37,545
Josh!

132
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,270
Renai.

133
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,230
I'm right here.

134
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,232
<i>What'?
Rena“</i>

135
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,861
Oh, no, no, no.

136
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,488
Elise! Elise!

137
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,575
Mom, get Dalton out of here!
Call an ambulance!

138
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:08,867
No, no, no. Elise!

139
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,828
Oh, no!

140
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,288
No, no!

141
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,334
What?

142
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,753
Why are you looking
at me like that?

143
00:15:21,297 --> 00:15:22,715
You think I did this?

144
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,637
Did you believe him?

145
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,556
He's my husband. That's
not what I asked.

146
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,060
Yes, I believed him. My husband
isn't capable of killing anybody.

147
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,981
This is a photo Elise took
seconds before she was killed.

148
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,609
Can you tell me who that
is in this picture?

149
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,989
There were a lot of strange
things happening in our house.

150
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,116
I saw apparitions,
lots of them.

151
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,202
Are you telling me that this
is a photograph of a ghost?

152
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:55,497
Listen, I'm not interested
in ghosts, Mrs. Lambert.

153
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:58,208
I'm interested in the living
people who create them.

154
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,713
Elise has marks on her neck

155
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,882
that were put there
by human hands.

156
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:11,055
I'll let you know if forensics
matches those marks to your husband.

157
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:21,273
Jessica, we're home.

158
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:22,316
Hey, guys.

159
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,153
Dad! Look what I made. Hey.

160
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,655
What?
It's a cup phone.

161
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,490
See? You put your ear in that,
and I put my mouth in that.

162
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:32,868
You are a genius. Absolute brilliance.
Thanks for watching them.

163
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,495
Say hi to your mom from me.
I will.

164
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,501
Oh. Mom,
I'll get that.

165
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,378
I'll go up and make the beds.

166
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,021
All right.

167
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:02,648
Time for bed, boys.

168
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,441
How long are we
gonna be here for?

169
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,694
We're gonna be at Grandma's
house for a little bit

170
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,821
while the police
work at our house.

171
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,118
You know, this house has been
in the family for a long time.

172
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,869
And you guys

173
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,790
get to stay in
Daddy's old bedroom.

174
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,875
Did you see
anything bad in here?

175
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,002
No.

176
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:26,588
And neither will you, okay?

177
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:27,798
Okay.

178
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,299
Good night.

179
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,055
What?

180
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,349
Just glad you're awake.

181
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:42,479
Good night, boys.

182
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:43,647
Good night.

183
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,403
Hey, Dalton.

184
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,738
What?

185
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:52,906
Look what I made.

186
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,491
Do I have to?

187
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,744
Yeah.

188
00:17:58,495 --> 00:17:59,538
This is stupid.

189
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,208
Come on, it really works. I wanna
ask you something, all right?

190
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,710
All right, fine. The
string needs to be tight.

191
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,587
Go farther back.
Okay.

192
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,965
So, what do you think of this?

193
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,551
I think it's stupid.

194
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:13,969
Hey.

195
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,228
Lorraine?

196
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,444
It's okay.

197
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,697
It's still happening.
What is?

198
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,866
I heard the piano playing
by itself downstairs

199
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,494
and I found Kali on the floor
of her room by her crib!

200
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:26,870
Well, maybe she
climbed out of her crib.

201
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:28,372
Has she ever done that before?

202
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,207
What? What is
wrong with you?

203
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,876
Renai, I just want us to move
on from this, that's all.

204
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,440
I want us to be
a normal family again.

205
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,756
There is nothing normal about this, okay?
These things are still here.

206
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,093
Elise is dead! No one's talking about it!
Someone murdered her!

207
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,303
Then let's talk about it.

208
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:44,888
You think I did it?

209
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:49,142
No. No, I don't.

210
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:50,477
Good. Good.

211
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,853
Because I know what happened.

212
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:54,272
I went into that place
to get our son back

213
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:57,442
and something evil followed
me and killed Elise.

214
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,195
You saw it.

215
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,822
You saw those things.

216
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:06,702
Listen to me. Nothing is gonna
bother us, not anymore.

217
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,162
We have our family back.

218
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:11,915
We have our son.

219
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,002
Isn't that what
we should be focusing on?

220
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:19,172
Yeah.

221
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,995
You think all the
ghosts we've seen

222
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:53,123
would somehow make me feel
better that Elise is gone.

223
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,043
I mean, you and I have

224
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:59,629
firsthand knowledge that there's
something out there beyond death.

225
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:04,926
But it's not helping.

226
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,059
Turns out the living version
of someone is always better.

227
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:33,205
She never left the
reading room unlocked.

228
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,636
You first.

229
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:51,181
Hunter, ninja, bear.

230
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:57,104
Hunter, ninja, bear.

231
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,652
That's bullshit.

232
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,115
How does a bear
beat a goddamn ninja?

233
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:10,033
Superior sense
of smell, my friend.

234
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,089
You know what? I don't think
we should be down here.

235
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,428
Let's go back.

236
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:42,107
That's a private room.
You should stay...

237
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,734
See?
Oh, my nuts!

238
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,320
I'm not helping.

239
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:11,636
<i>Hi, Josh. I'm Elise.</i>

240
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,138
Hey.

241
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,473
<i>I would love to ask you
some simple questions.</i>

242
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,643
<i>But they're the good kind,
the kind you can't get wrong.</i>

243
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:19,978
<i>Do you like living here?</i>

244
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,146
Yeah.

245
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:24,232
Amateur framing.
Just horrible.

246
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,236
<i>A few.
One kid lives next door.</i>

247
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,033
<i>Can you stop it?</i>

248
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:35,202
<i>I could try
to take away his gift</i>

249
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,454
<i>to suppress his
memory of his ability.</i>

250
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:38,830
<i>How would we do that?</i>

251
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:40,123
<i>I'll show you.</i>

252
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,134
Who the hell's he talking to?

253
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:53,428
<i>I could try
to take away his gift,</i>

254
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,180
<i>to suppress his
memory of his ability.</i>

255
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:56,389
<i>How would we do that?</i>

256
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:57,515
<i>I'll show you.</i>

257
00:25:58,725 --> 00:25:59,726
Right there.

258
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:48,066
sleep.
Then I flew away.

259
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,989
Please don't leave us again.

260
00:26:58,618 --> 00:26:59,661
Grandma?

261
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:01,663
Mmm-hmm.

262
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:05,417
There's someone
standing behind you.

263
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,594
Renai?

264
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:40,822
Oh, my God, Josh!
Mom!

265
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:42,574
Did you see her?
I saw someone!

266
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:44,617
No, you didn't. No, I did!
There was somebody...

267
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,077
Ma, there is no one here, okay?

268
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,288
Because if there was,
that would scare my family,

269
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:51,124
and I don't need Renai hearing
any of that stuff right now.

270
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:52,959
Understand?

271
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,965
Yeah, you're right.
Um...

272
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:00,717
It was probably my imagination.

273
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,135
Yeah.

274
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,721
Sorry. You should
get some sleep.

275
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:29,537
You want some more?

276
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:35,960
All right, go farther back so we can stretch it.
We need to make it tight.

277
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,463
Daddy?

278
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:40,173
I gotcha! I gotcha!
Oh, my God!

279
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:42,008
I'm going to eat you.

280
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:43,092
Mom?

281
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:45,803
Hey, honey, what do you
want for breakfast?

282
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,182
Anything you want.

283
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,436
I don't care.

284
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,315
What's wrong?

285
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:00,151
What's the matter?
You can tell me.

286
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,404
I had a bad dream.

287
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,534
Okay.

288
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,953
I'm sorry.
What was it about?

289
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:14,082
I was in my bed sleeping.

290
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,543
Grandma walked in.

291
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:22,465
I could see someone
else in my room.

292
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,968
<i>Please don't leave us again.</i>

293
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,515
<i>Grandma?</i>

294
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,183
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

295
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:35,228
<i>There's someone
standing behind you.</i>

296
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,527
I tried to wake myself up.

297
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,280
It took a while, but I did it.

298
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:47,824
I heard voices in the hallway.

299
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:56,124
You got to go.

300
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:57,667
You have to go.

301
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,751
<i>It was Daddy.</i>

302
00:31:58,835 --> 00:31:59,794
You have to leave.

303
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:02,005
And he was talking to someone.

304
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,592
You have to go.

305
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:15,018
Is there something
wrong with Daddy, Mom?

306
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:18,354
No.

307
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:19,856
No, honey.

308
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,899
He's just been through a lot.

309
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:24,569
That's all.
We all have.

310
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:26,821
It's okay, it's just a dream.

311
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:30,241
I'm gonna take
the boys to school.

312
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,118
You should rest, relax a bit.

313
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:36,623
Come on, son.

314
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,043
Okay.

315
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:55,433
Are you okay, Lorraine?

316
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:56,517
You said something was wrong.

317
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:59,604
Whatever it was
that killed Elise,

318
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:04,067
whatever it was that
was haunting my family

319
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,403
is not done with us.

320
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:13,451
Last night I saw
someone in my house.

321
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,913
I need your help.

322
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:20,083
Do you remember the first
time Elise visited your house

323
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,210
to talk to Josh
when he was a boy?

324
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:25,129
No. I did a lot
to try to...

325
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:28,800
Try to forget that part of
my life, until recently.

326
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:31,344
All right. Well,
Elise hypnotized him,

327
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,554
asked him a series
of questions.

328
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:36,974
I digitized the actual footage
taken from the night.

329
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:41,604
I cropped and
lightened the image.

330
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,067
What?

331
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:48,903
Lorraine, is that Josh?

332
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:51,864
How is that possible?

333
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:54,742
We don't know.

334
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:58,538
If only Elise
were here to help us.

335
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,588
What?

336
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:29,318
Hello?

337
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:32,196
<i>Renai Lambert,
this is Detective Sendai.</i>

338
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:33,489
Oh.

339
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:35,491
Hello, Detective.

340
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:39,078
<i>I told you I would inform you
once I got the forensics results.</i>

341
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,371
<i>Well, I got some.</i>

342
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:43,249
<i>It seems the bruises
on Elise Rainier's neck</i>

343
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,752
<i>do not match your
husband's hands.</i>

344
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:48,087
<i>We're not ruling
anything out at this point,</i>

345
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:49,964
<i>but I just thought
you should know.</i>

346
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:53,426
Thank you, Detective.
Uh...

347
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:58,097
I really needed to hear that.
Thank you.

Kali?

354
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,697
Kali, what's wrong?

355
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:41,826
Kali! Kali!

356
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:46,706

00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:09,353
Kali!

362
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:14,734
Kali!

363
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:16,402
Kali!

364
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:18,946
Kali? Baby?

365
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,240
My baby, Kali. Kali.

366
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:22,909
Don't you dare!

367
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:43,346
He's here.

368
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:48,935
Carl, I'm Specs. I'm the guy
you spoke to on the phone.

369
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:50,645
Oh, hello!
Come in.

370
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:53,773
Hi, Carl.
Oh.

371
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,858
It's been a long time.

372
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:57,234
Yeah.

373
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,947
Looks like I did the
aging for the both of us.

374
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,239
Oh, please stop it.

375
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:04,784
You met Specs.
This is Tucker.

376
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:09,080
Elise talked about you a lot.

377
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:10,915
Oh. Yeah, said you were
the second best person

378
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:11,999
she ever worked with.

379
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,335
Second best, that's generous.

380
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:20,257
I had been meaning to catch
up with her, to call her.

381
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:22,927
But I always kept putting it off
till the next week, you know?

382
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,221
And now she's gone.

383
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:28,307
Well, maybe this is your
chance to say your good-byes.

384
00:38:28,391 --> 00:38:31,978
Specs told me on the phone,
but I'm not sure we should...

385
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:33,896
We have questions
that need answering,

386
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,316
and the only person we could
think of to ask is Elise.

387
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,111
Please help us, Carl.

388
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:42,488
Help us contact her.

389
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:47,660
Everybody has their
own way of making contact.

390
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:50,162
This is mine.

391
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:53,791
I ask questions and the
spirits answer with the dice.

392
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,876
You look for the words
in the letters.

393
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:03,926
Elise, we are
calling out to you.

394
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:06,554
Tell us if you are there.

395
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:22,820
Elise, please talk to us.

396
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:25,906
Give us a sign that
you can hear my voice.

397
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:34,665
All right, I suppose
I should've explained

398
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:36,029
that this isn't
an exact science.

399
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:39,712
Sometimes contact
can't be made.

400
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:41,964
Elise.

401
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:46,510
Please tell me, are you here?

402
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:49,889
Are you here?

403
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,650
I'l go get...
No!

404
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:03,152
Do not break the circle.

405
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:27,051
Elise.

406
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:29,762
We need to know who killed you.

407
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:30,846
Tell us.

408
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,683
"She did."

409
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:50,449
What does she want?

410
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:54,620
I see it.

411
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:56,497
Where?

412
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:01,335
"K-l-L-L."

413
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:08,926
Where is she?

414
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:13,055
"Hiding."

415
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:18,894
Where is she hiding?

416
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:41,750
Elise, tell us where
to find your killer.

417
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:49,675
"Our Lady Angls"?

418
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:51,844
Our Lady Angls,
what does that mean?

419
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,929
It's "Angels."

420
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:55,764
Our Lady of the Angels.

421
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,558
It's a hospital.

422
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:01,770
I know because
I used to work there.

423
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:15,451
Renai?

424
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:33,594
Renai.

425
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:52,154
Most of my work
was in this East Wing.

426
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:55,074
But it's all closed now.

427
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:56,825
Now only the ghosts are left.

428
00:42:57,243 --> 00:43:00,246
Personally, I
prefer the ghosts to people.

429
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:06,627
The question is,
what are we looking for?

430
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,713
Elise led us here for a reason.

431
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:12,549
Just forget
the actual building.

432
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:15,719
Think of the doctors,
the nurses you worked with,

433
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:17,596
the patients, everyone.

434
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:39,827
Mama! Mama!

435
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:55,551
What is it?

436
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:07,229
In there.

437
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,130
What was in this room?

438
00:44:37,134 --> 00:44:39,428
This was an ICU.

439
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:42,931
I remember it very well.

440
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,688
Should we do
pizza night tonight?

441
00:44:49,772 --> 00:44:50,939
How about mac and cheese?

442
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:52,024
Hi, Pam.
Hi, Lorraine.

443
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,525
Mac and cheese.

444
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:55,486
Okay, that can be done.

445
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:59,365
Keep quiet.
Don't touch anything.

446
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:02,117
How is he?

447
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:04,661
His vital signs
are stabilizing,

448
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,205
but he's still unresponsive.

449
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:09,875
His blood
pressure's doing better.

450
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,502
Yes, after we upped the dosage.

451
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:13,587
- Okay, let's keep him on that.
- Okay.

452
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,256
And when was the last
time you checked the glucose?

453
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:30,813
It's okay.
It's okay.

454
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:36,693
<i>A few days
later, I saw him again.</i>

455
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:38,946
<i>For the last time.</i>

456
00:45:57,131 --> 00:45:59,633
Parker, what are you...

457
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:02,636
You should be resting.
You shouldn't be out of bed.

458
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:14,606
Listen, I wanna apologize
for my son the other day.

459
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,859
He was being a nosy kid.

460
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:39,548
Hey, Hillary, why is the
patient from Room 104

461
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:40,883
up and walking around?

462
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:43,385
What do you mean?

463
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:45,971
The patient from ICU,
Parker Crane?

464
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:48,640
What do you mean,
walking around?

465
00:46:48,724 --> 00:46:50,976
I just rode down in
the elevator with him.

466
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:52,644
He should be in bed,
on the monitor...

467
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:56,440
Lorraine, that patient
died yesterday morning.

468
00:46:56,523 --> 00:46:57,858
What?

469
00:46:57,941 --> 00:46:59,401
He jumped to his death.

470
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:12,581
So, why was he
here in the first place?

471
00:47:14,917 --> 00:47:18,462
He tried to castrate himself.

472
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:45,697
Oh, no.

473
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,200
No.

474
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:50,202
No, not yet.

475
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:52,412
Please, no.

476
00:47:52,496 --> 00:47:58,544
Your dead soul
is killing his living skin.

477
00:47:58,627 --> 00:48:00,754
I wanna live.

478
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:02,881
I wanna live!

479
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:06,885
<i>Only if you kill them.</i>

480
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:09,388
No. Please, no.

481
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,306
I can't, Mother.

482
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,559
Please don't make me do it.

483
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:15,602
<i>You must!</i>

484
00:48:15,686 --> 00:48:19,940
<i>Or you'll waste away.</i>

485
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:35,789
Yes, we can.

486
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:37,374
No way.
Lorraine!

487
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:41,878
Is that our man?

488
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:43,505
Parker Crane, that's him.

489
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,301
This address,
there's something there.

490
00:48:58,228 --> 00:49:00,355
It's okay, it's okay.
Renai.

491
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:03,609
It's okay. It's okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

492
00:49:03,692 --> 00:49:05,027
Oh, God.
You're okay.

493
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:07,029
Where's Kali?

494
00:49:07,112 --> 00:49:08,739
She's fine.
She's in her room sleeping.

495
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:11,408
She's fine. No, she's not!
No, she's not!

496
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:14,620
She's asleep! RenaH No! No!

497
00:49:14,703 --> 00:49:16,121
Kali.

498
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:21,293
See? I told you,
she's fine.

499
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:29,676
Oh, God! What happened? Tell me.

500
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,886
Someone attacked me!

501
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:32,137
Who?

502
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,140
In the living room, a woman. She hit me.
These things are back, Josh!

503
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:36,808
We have to go!
We gotta get the kids

504
00:49:36,892 --> 00:49:38,477
and we gotta get
out of the house!

505
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,853
No, it's not the house.
You know that.

506
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:41,021
We've been through this before.

507
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:43,482
They will follow us. You
have to just not be afraid.

508
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:44,816
You have to relax.

509
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,152
Relax? I can't relax!

510
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:48,403
There's ghosts everywhere!

511
00:49:48,487 --> 00:49:49,821
It's like we're already dead!

512
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:51,406
No, it's not!

513
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:53,825
No, it's not.

514
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:56,244
This is nothing
like being dead.

515
00:49:57,079 --> 00:49:59,831
I know.
I have seen it.

516
00:49:59,915 --> 00:50:01,750
I have seen where
these things exist.

517
00:50:02,209 --> 00:50:03,835
They want what you have.

518
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:05,337
Life.

519
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,381
But they have
no power over you.

520
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:11,051
All you have to do is ignore
them, and they will go away.

521
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:01,810
See, I told you.

522
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:16,116
What are you doing?

523
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:23,665
That's the song
that's been playing.

524
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:26,585
What song?
What are you talking about?

525
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:30,922
You don't know thatsong?

526
00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:33,258
No, I don't.

527
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:37,512
That's my song,
the song I wrote for you?

528
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:44,853
Well, it's not the song that
we should be worried about.

529
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:50,150
There's somebody in this house.

530
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:04,289
Stay here.

531
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:12,506
Hey, look,
they left the window open.

532
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,679
Watch your step.

533
00:52:34,945 --> 00:52:36,655
Do you feel something?

534
00:52:36,738 --> 00:52:37,739
Um...

535
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:42,369
Let's just say that
this house is not a place

536
00:52:42,452 --> 00:52:44,746
where many good things
have happened.

537
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,461
Probably a lot of good
collectibles in here.

538
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:07,978
What is that smell?

539
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:10,021
Hey, Specs.

540
00:53:10,105 --> 00:53:11,106
Yeah.

541
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,983
Upstairs.

542
00:54:13,168 --> 00:54:16,838
I'm guessing this might
be Parker Crane's bedroom.

543
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:20,342
No, it seems a little
girly for a boy's bedroom,

544
00:54:20,425 --> 00:54:21,426
don't you think?

545
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:22,844
Why?

546
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:25,263
I mean, look at this dollhouse.

547
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:27,974
What?

548
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,394
I had a dollhouse.

549
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:34,564
This is a Rhode Island Red.

550
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:37,692
Come on, let's get outta here.

551
00:54:50,622 --> 00:54:51,706
This is my room!

552
00:54:56,169 --> 00:54:57,963
Tucker!

553
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:36,876
Listen,
Tucker. Tucker.

554
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:47,095
You can't be in here.

555
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,103
If she sees you,
she'll make me kill you.

556
00:56:17,459 --> 00:56:19,878
Dalton.

557
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:25,967
<i>Dalton.</i>

558
00:56:33,099 --> 00:56:34,601
What?

559
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:40,315
<i>I have something to show you.</i>

560
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,234
Stop, Foster.

561
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:46,404
Just go back to bed. You're
gonna get us in trouble.

562
00:56:46,488 --> 00:56:49,491
<i>I'm not Foster.</i>

563
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:30,198
Foster, wake up.

564
00:57:31,658 --> 00:57:34,744
Foster, please wake up!

565
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:57,976
Who are you?

566
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:03,314
<i>The ones he killed.</i>

567
00:58:04,399 --> 00:58:06,818
<i>We are many.</i>

568
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:09,154
What do you want?

569
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:25,211
<i>Please help me!</i>

570
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,841
<i>Make the pain stop!</i>

571
00:58:46,608 --> 00:58:49,485
It's okay! It's okay! It's okay!

572
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:52,739
It's okay!
It's okay! It's okay!

573
00:58:52,822 --> 00:58:57,202
Oh, Jesus.
Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

574
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:01,539
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

575
00:59:01,623 --> 00:59:04,542
It was just a dream.
It's just a dream.

576
00:59:04,626 --> 00:59:06,961
It's just a dream.

577
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:14,469
You're trying to reach
her, but you won't.

578
00:59:16,221 --> 00:59:18,014
Not from over there.

579
00:59:19,974 --> 00:59:22,018
Shadows are your home now.

580
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:37,575
<i>Help!</i>

581
00:59:58,346 --> 00:59:59,681
Elise.

582
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:01,933
Why did you bring us here?

583
01:00:12,694 --> 01:00:14,946
What are we looking for?

584
01:00:29,419 --> 01:00:31,379
<i>"Mors."</i>

585
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:34,757
Latin for "Death"?

586
01:00:49,022 --> 01:00:50,189
Carl.

587
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:53,609
This is the woman
who was in my house.

588
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:56,696
Lorraine, look out!

589
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:06,581
What happened?

590
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,003
What happened?
Give me a light over here.

591
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:13,421
Over here!

592
01:01:16,591 --> 01:01:18,301
You're not Elise, are you?

593
01:01:32,774 --> 01:01:34,192
Who are you?

594
01:01:39,614 --> 01:01:42,241
Mother of Death.

595
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:44,535
What does that mean?

596
01:01:45,078 --> 01:01:46,996
It's literal.

597
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:50,041
It simply means the mother

598
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:51,834
of Parker Crane.

599
01:02:29,539 --> 01:02:30,915
Okay, move that.

600
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:36,879
One, two, and three.

601
01:02:43,386 --> 01:02:44,846
Pull it this way.

602
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:55,249
Don't touch anything.

603
01:04:18,648 --> 01:04:19,941
Guys.

604
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:24,362
"Bride in Black."

605
01:04:25,613 --> 01:04:27,156
I know that name.

606
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:30,409
Where? What you got?

607
01:04:32,954 --> 01:04:35,540
"One of the victims
managed to elude the killer.

608
01:04:35,623 --> 01:04:39,210
"Police said she
described her attacker

609
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:44,882
"as an old woman dressed in a
black wedding gown and veil."

610
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:50,930
"Bride in Black
claims his 15th victim."

611
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:52,682
Victims.

612
01:04:56,644 --> 01:04:58,104
Oh, my God.

613
01:05:03,651 --> 01:05:04,860
Wait a sec.

614
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:07,530
Uh...

615
01:05:34,557 --> 01:05:37,518
Parker wore that dress

616
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:39,353
to commit these murders.

617
01:05:40,855 --> 01:05:42,815
It was his disguise.

618
01:05:44,442 --> 01:05:47,653
He killed for his mother
because she forced him to.

619
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,323
He wanted his childhood back.

620
01:05:50,698 --> 01:05:52,700
That's why he went
after your son.

621
01:06:16,057 --> 01:06:18,768
Renai!
Jesus! Lorraine!

622
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:19,935
Where have you been?

623
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:21,312
I need to speak to you.

624
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:22,480
Where is he, Josh?

625
01:06:22,563 --> 01:06:24,523
He's not feeling well.
He's been in bed all day.

626
01:06:24,607 --> 01:06:25,847
And where are
Dalton and Foster?

627
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,109
I just dropped
them off at Jessica's.

628
01:06:27,193 --> 01:06:28,653
Why? You and the
kids are in danger.

629
01:06:28,736 --> 01:06:29,820
I'll explain, but not here.

630
01:06:29,904 --> 01:06:31,072
Please, let's just
get in the car and go.

631
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:32,740
Have you been seeing them, too?

632
01:06:34,784 --> 01:06:36,369
Around the house?

633
01:06:37,703 --> 01:06:40,998
It's not the house, it's Josh.

634
01:07:04,939 --> 01:07:06,732
They're gone.
It's go time.

635
01:07:06,899 --> 01:07:10,319
Okay.
We'll hear everything.

636
01:07:10,403 --> 01:07:12,363
Sing out if you need us.

637
01:07:12,446 --> 01:07:14,990
The code word
is "Quesadilla."

638
01:07:15,116 --> 01:07:16,717
Say it with me. Quesadilla.
"Quesadilla."

639
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:19,036
I thought we agreed on
"Unicorn" as the code word.

640
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,372
Uh... "Quesadilla" is easier
to bring up in conversation.

641
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:22,832
Not at all.
How would you bring up

642
01:07:22,915 --> 01:07:24,115
"quesadilla" in a conversation?

643
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:26,565
It's lunch time. It's quesadilla time.
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

644
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:28,462
I'd love a quesadilla.
Can I have a quesadilla?

645
01:07:28,546 --> 01:07:29,714
Really?

646
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:31,590
I don't think it matters.

647
01:07:31,716 --> 01:07:33,676
You'll know if I need you.
It doesn't matter.

648
01:07:36,137 --> 01:07:37,805
Tranquilizer.

649
01:07:54,864 --> 01:07:56,115
Can I help you?

650
01:07:57,158 --> 01:07:58,284
My name's Carl.

651
01:07:59,744 --> 01:08:02,246
Uh, I know you don't
remember me, Josh.

652
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:05,374
Elise and I did our best
to make sure of that.

653
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:07,334
You're right,
I don't remember you.

654
01:08:08,169 --> 01:08:11,630
Your mother called me when you
started experiencing some problems

655
01:08:11,714 --> 01:08:16,385
<i>and what I saw scared me so badly
that I, uh, reached out to Elise.</i>

656
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,013
Now Elise is gone.

657
01:08:19,472 --> 01:08:22,933
I was wondering if you could
help give me some closure.

658
01:08:24,852 --> 01:08:26,145
Ineedit

659
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:29,690
Sure.

660
01:08:32,693 --> 01:08:33,736
Okay.

661
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:39,575
Phew!

662
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:41,368
This is pretty exciting.

663
01:08:41,452 --> 01:08:43,412
I feel like an FBI agent.

664
01:08:54,715 --> 01:08:58,093
Tell me what you're thinking.
Lorraine, what do you know?

665
01:08:58,177 --> 01:09:01,931
I think that when Josh went
into that other world,

666
01:09:02,932 --> 01:09:04,558
something else came back.

667
01:09:05,434 --> 01:09:08,687
We believe it's a
spirit that's killed

668
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:11,065
many times before,
and it'll kill again.

669
01:09:11,148 --> 01:09:14,109
That's why I had to get you
and the kids away from him.

670
01:09:14,193 --> 01:09:17,154
Last night, when I
looked into his eyes,

671
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:20,282
like I have every day
for the last 12 years,

672
01:09:20,366 --> 01:09:23,077
was the first time
I didn't recognize him.

673
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,788
I was scared of him.

674
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:27,122
Right now, at the house,

675
01:09:27,206 --> 01:09:31,168
there is an acquaintance of Elise's
and mine, and he's talking to Josh.

676
01:09:31,252 --> 01:09:33,921
We're going to try to sedate
him and when he's under,

677
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:36,966
we're going to try to reach
out to the real Josh.

678
01:09:37,049 --> 01:09:38,968
And what if we can't find him?

679
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:46,141
Are you feeling okay?

680
01:09:47,393 --> 01:09:48,769
I'm fine.

681
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:51,316
Just woke up feeling
a little under the weather.

682
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:54,984
Isuppose I wanted to ask you

683
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:58,028
if you've any idea
what happened to Elise.

684
01:09:58,112 --> 01:09:59,864
No, I don't.

685
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:03,284
Look, I...

686
01:10:04,368 --> 01:10:07,329
I should remind you that, um...

687
01:10:07,413 --> 01:10:09,623
I'm not the person who's
gonna look at you funny

688
01:10:09,707 --> 01:10:12,543
if you tell me
something unusual.

689
01:10:12,626 --> 01:10:13,627
Mmm-hmm.

690
01:10:13,752 --> 01:10:16,338
I've seen things
with my own eyes

691
01:10:17,131 --> 01:10:20,175
that most people have to
go to sleep to conjure up.

692
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:24,972
Elise sent me to a place
that still haunts my dreams.

693
01:10:26,891 --> 01:10:28,851
But I got my son back.

694
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:35,608
I don't know, I left the
room for about 10 minutes,

695
01:10:35,691 --> 01:10:38,611
and when I came back,
Elise was dead.

696
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:41,697
She had been strangled.

697
01:10:45,534 --> 01:10:47,244
That's pretty horrific.

698
01:10:50,831 --> 01:10:51,832
I guess.

699
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:53,250
Oh!

700
01:10:54,335 --> 01:10:55,336
Um...

701
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:59,048
When you were a boy,

702
01:10:59,131 --> 01:11:02,092
you said it was an old
woman who haunted you.

703
01:11:02,968 --> 01:11:05,095
Did you see that same old woman

704
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:06,680
when you were in
that other world?

705
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:09,224
No.

706
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:13,562
Okay. Um...

707
01:11:20,027 --> 01:11:22,571
Say, would you like a drink?

708
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:26,867
Water. A glass of
water would be nice.

709
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:28,702
Sure.

710
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,562
What you got there?

711
01:11:56,855 --> 01:11:58,524
Huh? Oh. Uh...

712
01:11:58,691 --> 01:11:59,733
Nothing.

713
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:02,236
I thought maybe you were
playing with your dice.

714
01:12:03,904 --> 01:12:05,197
Excuse me?

715
01:12:05,447 --> 01:12:08,075
Mother tells me you
like to play with dice.

716
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:12,871
Did she? I didn't realize you
guys had spoken this morning.

717
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:16,542
It's how I do my readings.

718
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:17,710
Ah.

719
01:12:22,715 --> 01:12:24,076
What have you got
behind your back?

720
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:31,765
Why don't you ask your dice
what I have behind my back?

721
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:37,438
Come on, roll them and see.

722
01:12:39,898 --> 01:12:42,735
Mother tells me you were very
good with them at the house.

723
01:12:46,447 --> 01:12:48,699
Come on, it'll be fun.

724
01:12:57,458 --> 01:12:58,459
What...

725
01:12:58,542 --> 01:12:59,918
What does Josh...

726
01:13:04,256 --> 01:13:09,136
What is Parker Crane
holding behind his back?

727
01:13:19,313 --> 01:13:20,481
She was always right.

728
01:13:23,275 --> 01:13:24,359
Shit!

729
01:13:30,491 --> 01:13:31,492
Ah!

730
01:13:32,618 --> 01:13:34,161
Come on!

731
01:13:49,802 --> 01:13:51,053
Quesadilla.

732
01:13:55,516 --> 01:13:57,059
- Carl!
- In here!

733
01:13:57,768 --> 01:13:58,769
I got you!

734
01:14:46,692 --> 01:14:49,069
<i>I know you, don't I?</i>

735
01:14:50,904 --> 01:14:54,366
<i>Well, if you're here, I guess I
don't have to ask where I am.</i>

736
01:15:00,164 --> 01:15:01,915
<i>He killed you.</i>

737
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:05,794
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

738
01:15:05,878 --> 01:15:08,630
<i>That thing is gonna murder my
family if I don't get back.</i>

739
01:15:08,714 --> 01:15:11,049
<i>I am trapped here.
I'm getting weaker</i>

740
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:13,427
<i>the longer I'm away
from my body.</i>

741
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:20,267
<i>Elise.</i>

742
01:15:20,976 --> 01:15:22,686
<i>Elise, she's not here.</i>

743
01:15:23,687 --> 01:15:25,647
<i>Well, then we'll
have to find her.</i>

744
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,284
<i>Into the Further we go.</i>

745
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:48,337
<i>You need to kill the others.</i>

746
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:51,840
<i>It's the only
way to stay alive.</i>

747
01:15:52,174 --> 01:15:54,676
Shut up! Shut up!
Get out of my head!

748
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,386
Shutup!
Get outta here!

749
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:58,096
Get out of my head!

750
01:16:10,442 --> 01:16:13,904
Okay, I've just got a message from Tucker.
He says they're ready.

751
01:16:20,035 --> 01:16:21,370
<i>JOSH". Elise?</i>

752
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:27,626
<i>Elise!</i>

753
01:16:32,339 --> 01:16:34,258
<i>Don't do that.</i>

754
01:16:43,558 --> 01:16:45,394
<i>What is it?</i>

755
01:16:45,477 --> 01:16:47,521
<i>There's someone
standing in front of you.</i>

756
01:16:51,149 --> 01:16:52,651
<i>I don't see anybody.</i>

757
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:54,861
<i>He's right in front of you!</i>

758
01:16:56,697 --> 01:16:57,698
<i>He's...</i>

759
01:16:57,781 --> 01:16:59,157
<i>He's talking to you.</i>

760
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:02,452
<i>What's he saying?</i>

761
01:17:02,536 --> 01:17:03,787
<i>CARL".
"He's got your baby."</i>

762
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:07,374
<i>"He's got your baby. He's got your baby.
He's got your baby."</i>

763
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:10,043
<i>He's got your baby.
He's got your baby.</i>

764
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:14,715
<i>What's he doing now?</i>

765
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:16,091
<i>He...</i>

766
01:17:16,174 --> 01:17:18,343
<i>He's pointing at something.</i>

767
01:17:23,307 --> 01:17:24,850
<i>Over there.</i>

768
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:39,614
<i>I heard this noise coming from Kali's room.
It was on the baby monitor.</i>

769
01:17:39,698 --> 01:17:40,779
<i>Probably just interference.</i>

770
01:17:40,824 --> 01:17:41,825
<i>. I don't know.</i>

771
01:17:41,908 --> 01:17:46,204
It sounded so clear. It was
like this whispering. It was...

772
01:17:46,288 --> 01:17:47,914
Scared the hell out of me.

773
01:17:48,874 --> 01:17:51,960
<i>Then I went to hear the
monitor and turned up the volume</i>

774
01:17:52,044 --> 01:17:53,337
<i>and heard a man's voice.</i>

775
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:56,715
<i>I ran up there
and I looked inside.</i>

776
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:03,305
<i>Probably just some noise.
Those things always pick up...</i>

777
01:18:08,643 --> 01:18:11,688
<i>No! No! No.</i>

778
01:18:12,689 --> 01:18:14,316
<i>No! Hey!</i>

779
01:18:18,737 --> 01:18:19,905
Who the hell is that?

780
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:24,951
Hold on.

781
01:18:26,244 --> 01:18:27,496
Stay here.

782
01:18:27,788 --> 01:18:29,373
<i>Renai!</i>

783
01:18:57,818 --> 01:18:59,319
Hello?

784
01:19:07,536 --> 01:19:09,037
<i>No. Josh, no!</i>

785
01:19:24,511 --> 01:19:27,222
Josh! Josh! Quick! There's someone in here!
Someone in the curtains!

786
01:19:29,266 --> 01:19:30,267
<i>CARL'. Josh! Josh!</i>

787
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:31,351
<i>Renai!</i>

788
01:19:36,148 --> 01:19:37,482
<i>Renai!</i>

789
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:45,282
<i>Get away from her!</i>

790
01:19:45,365 --> 01:19:47,367
<i>Get away from her!</i>

791
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,498
<i>ELSE'. Go to hell!</i>

792
01:20:15,353 --> 01:20:16,521
Josh.

793
01:20:21,526 --> 01:20:24,362
<i>I wish I could say
it's good to see you.</i>

794
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:29,242
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

795
01:20:30,577 --> 01:20:31,745
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

796
01:20:32,496 --> 01:20:34,956
<i>We all pass through
this place eventually.</i>

797
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:37,792
<i>Hopefully, on our way
to someplace better.</i>

798
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:40,378
<i>I've seen that better place,</i>

799
01:20:40,795 --> 01:20:43,381
<i>but I came back here
because I heard you calling,</i>

800
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:45,091
<i>and I think I can help.</i>

801
01:20:48,261 --> 01:20:50,180
<i>Carl, what are you doing here?</i>

802
01:20:50,263 --> 01:20:52,807
<i>You are not
supposed to be here.</i>

803
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:54,601
<i>I failed you, Elise.</i>

804
01:20:54,976 --> 01:20:56,061
<i>Oh...</i>

805
01:20:56,353 --> 01:20:59,981
<i>No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.</i>

806
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,443
<i>You were looking for Josh
and you found him.</i>

807
01:21:04,945 --> 01:21:07,322
<i>Josh, you don't belong here,</i>

808
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:09,824
<i>and neither does that entity
belong in your world.</i>

809
01:21:09,908 --> 01:21:11,201
<i>I don't know how to fight her.</i>

810
01:21:11,284 --> 01:21:13,036
<i>Out there in the darkness,</i>

811
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:17,541
<i>she has a home where all her
memories live from her life.</i>

812
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:20,335
<i>Use those memories to draw
her out of your vessel</i>

813
01:21:20,418 --> 01:21:22,379
<i>so that you can get
back into your body.</i>

814
01:21:22,963 --> 01:21:24,506
<i>But where do I find her home?</i>

815
01:21:24,839 --> 01:21:26,591
<i>Only you know where that is.</i>

816
01:21:28,677 --> 01:21:30,053
<i>I don't remember.</i>

817
01:21:31,972 --> 01:21:34,349
<i>Maybe we're asking
the wrong Josh.</i>

818
01:21:40,647 --> 01:21:41,815
What happened?

819
01:21:41,898 --> 01:21:45,151
I saw what haunts him, and it's not a friend.
It's a parasite.

820
01:21:45,485 --> 01:21:48,029
I've never felt such
a malignant presence.

821
01:21:48,113 --> 01:21:50,073
<i>It wants to be him.</i>

822
01:21:50,156 --> 01:21:55,120
<i>Miss Lambert, I think your son
has a unique ability, a gift.</i>

823
01:22:02,127 --> 01:22:03,420
<i>Josh.</i>

824
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:06,631
<i>I need your help.</i>

825
01:22:07,465 --> 01:22:10,969
<i>I don't have any memories
of the old woman anymore,</i>

826
01:22:11,052 --> 01:22:12,887
<i>but you do.</i>

827
01:22:13,805 --> 01:22:15,890
<i>I need to know where she lives.</i>

828
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:26,860
<i>I'll show you.</i>

829
01:23:04,147 --> 01:23:06,775
<i>So that's what that was about.</i>

830
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,096
Carl?

831
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:48,233
Josh?

832
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:52,195
Josh?

833
01:23:54,906 --> 01:23:56,908
Hi, honey.

834
01:23:57,909 --> 01:24:01,204
I'm waiting for the boys.
They're not home yet.

835
01:24:01,454 --> 01:24:03,790
Did my friend
Carl stop by today?

836
01:24:05,959 --> 01:24:07,836
No, I don't think so.

837
01:24:24,477 --> 01:24:25,937
You did this to yourselves!

838
01:24:36,406 --> 01:24:38,742
It's been so long
since I felt real pain.

839
01:24:38,825 --> 01:24:40,493
Renai, help me!

840
01:24:43,663 --> 01:24:47,500
I missed it, but not as much as
I miss inflicting it on others.

841
01:25:06,644 --> 01:25:08,480
Renai, get out
of here! Run!

842
01:25:12,025 --> 01:25:13,359
I'll come back for you, Mommy!

843
01:25:33,296 --> 01:25:35,256
- Okay, guys, we're here.
- Yay!

844
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:36,341
Thanks, Jessica.

845
01:25:36,382 --> 01:25:37,943
Thank you. No problem.
See you tomorrow.

846
01:25:38,009 --> 01:25:39,302
Let's go, Foster.

847
01:25:41,179 --> 01:25:42,680
I didn't want this, RenaL

848
01:25:43,890 --> 01:25:47,101
She wanted me to kill
you, but I said no.

849
01:25:47,852 --> 01:25:51,064
But now, I know she was right.

850
01:26:02,075 --> 01:26:05,578
You are a miserable,
ungrateful bitch.

851
01:26:05,662 --> 01:26:07,956
You have no idea
how much you've wasted

852
01:26:08,039 --> 01:26:09,499
your life being
afraid of the dead,

853
01:26:09,582 --> 01:26:12,544
because pretty soon, you're
going to be one of them.

854
01:26:13,878 --> 01:26:16,965
Then, when I take you
to my home in the dark,

855
01:26:17,423 --> 01:26:20,134
you'll realize how happy
you should've been

856
01:26:20,218 --> 01:26:23,096
for your brief,
little moment in the sun.

857
01:26:42,448 --> 01:26:43,700
Mommy! Mommy!

858
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:45,535
Daddy! No!

859
01:26:54,794 --> 01:26:56,296
Come on!

860
01:28:38,564 --> 01:28:39,732
<i>Hello?</i>

861
01:28:45,863 --> 01:28:47,782
<i>My name is Parker!</i>

862
01:28:47,865 --> 01:28:49,367
<i>What is this?</i>

863
01:28:50,243 --> 01:28:52,537
<i>Did you do this?</i>

864
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,625
<i>Don't you dare!</i>

865
01:29:00,753 --> 01:29:02,046
<i>But, Mommy...</i>

866
01:29:05,216 --> 01:29:06,801
<i>Speak the truth.</i>

867
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:10,179
<i>Did you?</i>

868
01:29:12,724 --> 01:29:15,560
<i>Yes.
That is not your name!</i>

869
01:29:16,352 --> 01:29:19,689
<i>Parker is not your name!</i>

870
01:29:19,897 --> 01:29:23,109
<i>That is the name
your father gave you!</i>

871
01:29:23,317 --> 01:29:25,445
<i>Your name</i>

872
01:29:26,487 --> 01:29:28,114
<i>is Marilyn.</i>

873
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:31,117
<i>Do you understand?</i>

874
01:29:33,077 --> 01:29:34,954
<i>Repeat after me.</i>

875
01:29:36,414 --> 01:29:39,500
<i>"My name is Marilyn."</i>

876
01:29:41,794 --> 01:29:43,880
<i>Say m</i>

877
01:29:43,963 --> 01:29:45,673
<i>My name is...</i>

878
01:29:47,091 --> 01:29:48,468
<i>Marilyn.</i>

879
01:29:52,638 --> 01:29:53,681
<i>Quiet, now.</i>

880
01:29:54,307 --> 01:29:59,729
<i>If you don't be a good
little girl, you'll get...</i>

881
01:30:17,997 --> 01:30:20,416
Mommy, Mommy, I can go
into the dark place

882
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,085
and find Daddy,
if I go to sleep.

883
01:30:22,168 --> 01:30:23,669
No, it's too dangerous.

884
01:30:23,753 --> 01:30:25,088
I nearly lost you once before.

885
01:30:25,171 --> 01:30:26,464
I'm not gonna let
that happen again.

886
01:30:26,547 --> 01:30:30,009
Loan find him. I promise I'll find him.
I promise.

887
01:30:30,843 --> 01:30:31,886
I will.

888
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:40,353
Turn around.

889
01:30:50,863 --> 01:30:52,532
It's okay!

890
01:30:54,826 --> 01:30:55,868
Be careful.

891
01:30:58,955 --> 01:31:00,206
I love you.

892
01:31:38,619 --> 01:31:41,205
<i>Destroy her, Josh!
End this!</i>

893
01:31:46,043 --> 01:31:47,712
Where am <i>I?</i>

894
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:16,259
Let her go!

895
01:33:16,342 --> 01:33:17,343
Lorraine?

896
01:33:22,556 --> 01:33:23,683
Where is he?
He...

897
01:33:23,766 --> 01:33:24,850
He's got Renai.

898
01:33:34,777 --> 01:33:35,778
What the hell!

899
01:34:11,647 --> 01:34:14,734
<i>Parker, help me destroy
the memories of her.</i>

900
01:34:15,151 --> 01:34:16,736
<i>It will set you free.</i>

901
01:34:16,819 --> 01:34:19,030
<i>Please let me in.</i>

902
01:34:19,238 --> 01:34:20,990
<i>Open the door.</i>

903
01:34:39,925 --> 01:34:43,179
<i>Little girls need
to learn to be good!</i>

904
01:35:03,324 --> 01:35:04,950
No!

905
01:35:24,804 --> 01:35:25,805
Baby!

906
01:35:26,305 --> 01:35:27,473
Hey!

907
01:35:27,765 --> 01:35:29,392
Hey, come back!
Come back!

908
01:35:33,896 --> 01:35:34,897
<i>Elise!</i>

909
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,315
<i>Josh, go now.</i>

910
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:37,817
<i>I wish I could
take you with me.</i>

911
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,652
<i>I can't.
But you can take Carl.</i>

912
01:35:39,735 --> 01:35:40,778
<i>What?</i>

913
01:35:40,986 --> 01:35:42,655
<i>I told you,
you don't belong here.</i>

914
01:35:42,738 --> 01:35:44,448
<i>I felt your heartbeat
when I hugged you.</i>

915
01:35:44,532 --> 01:35:47,076
<i>You're still alive.
It's time to live again.</i>

916
01:35:47,159 --> 01:35:48,744
<i>But you both have to go now!</i>

917
01:35:49,286 --> 01:35:51,288
<i>Go now!</i>

918
01:35:51,372 --> 01:35:53,040
Go!

919
01:36:19,316 --> 01:36:20,484
<i>Get away!</i>

920
01:36:24,321 --> 01:36:26,740
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

921
01:36:27,533 --> 01:36:29,160
<i>DALTON". Daddy!</i>

922
01:36:29,827 --> 01:36:31,454
Dalton?

923
01:36:33,664 --> 01:36:34,832
<i>Dalton!</i>

924
01:36:34,915 --> 01:36:36,041
<i>DALTON". Daddy!</i>

925
01:36:38,002 --> 01:36:39,044
<i>Where are you, son?</i>

926
01:36:39,128 --> 01:36:40,504
<i>Daddy!</i>

927
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:42,381
<i>Oh!</i>

928
01:36:42,756 --> 01:36:45,634
<i>Oh, good boy!
What are you doing here?</i>

929
01:36:45,718 --> 01:36:47,970
<i>I came to bring you home!</i>

930
01:36:49,054 --> 01:36:50,139
<i>How did you find me?</i>

931
01:36:50,222 --> 01:36:51,932
<i>I followed your steps.</i>

932
01:36:52,016 --> 01:36:54,018
<i>RENAY. Please wake up!</i>

933
01:36:55,186 --> 01:36:57,188
Where are you?
Come back, come on!

934
01:36:58,355 --> 01:36:59,523
<i>Come back to me.</i>

935
01:36:59,607 --> 01:37:00,774
<i>That's Mommy.</i>

936
01:37:00,858 --> 01:37:02,651
<i>Wake up!</i>

937
01:37:03,694 --> 01:37:05,237
<i>Get back to me!</i>

938
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:08,073
<i>Clever boy.
Follow me.</i>

939
01:37:10,242 --> 01:37:11,494
Wake up.

940
01:37:11,577 --> 01:37:13,662
Come on, wake up!

941
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:42,566
It's me.

942
01:37:43,776 --> 01:37:45,736
Renai, it's me, it's okay.

943
01:37:46,654 --> 01:37:47,947
It's okay.

944
01:37:48,364 --> 01:37:49,949
Daddy?

945
01:37:50,491 --> 01:37:51,534
Yeah.

946
01:37:52,409 --> 01:37:53,494
Daddy, you're back!

947
01:37:53,577 --> 01:37:54,620
Yeah.

948
01:37:55,496 --> 01:37:57,122
Thanks to you.

949
01:38:00,167 --> 01:38:01,961
My boys. Hey, buddy.

950
01:38:07,925 --> 01:38:09,885
Renai, it's me, it's okay.

951
01:38:13,681 --> 01:38:15,975
I tried reaching you. I tried everything.

952
01:38:16,976 --> 01:38:18,310
I played your song.

953
01:38:29,321 --> 01:38:31,490
I should've known it was you.

954
01:38:32,783 --> 01:38:35,369
Only you could
play it that badly.

955
01:38:36,245 --> 01:38:37,538
<i>(BOTH LAUGH';</i>

956
01:38:53,178 --> 01:38:54,638
Bring it!

957
01:39:03,731 --> 01:39:04,857
Are you ready?

958
01:39:05,232 --> 01:39:06,859
We're ready.

959
01:39:07,735 --> 01:39:10,487
Ready to forget
once and for all.

960
01:39:10,571 --> 01:39:12,531
No more traveling, right?

961
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:16,076
This is the only
world we wanna be in.

962
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:17,953
Good, Mr. Lambert.

963
01:39:18,037 --> 01:39:20,748
So then, close your eyes.

964
01:39:22,833 --> 01:39:23,917
Both of you.

965
01:39:25,169 --> 01:39:27,129
Now take a deep breath,

966
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,507
and just listen to the ticking.

967
01:39:30,591 --> 01:39:34,970
Now feel yourselves getting
sleepier and sleepier,

968
01:39:35,054 --> 01:39:39,600
and let the darkness
drift further

969
01:39:39,683 --> 01:39:42,853
and further away.

970
01:40:11,256 --> 01:40:13,884
Who is it? I
have a message for you.

971
01:40:13,967 --> 01:40:15,386
It's about Allison.

972
01:40:19,556 --> 01:40:21,141
Is this some kind of joke?

973
01:40:21,225 --> 01:40:24,436
We have a close personal
friend who has, uh,

974
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,271
spoken with Allison.

975
01:40:26,397 --> 01:40:27,439
That's not possible.

976
01:40:27,523 --> 01:40:29,364
You better leave now
or I'm calling the police.

977
01:40:29,441 --> 01:40:31,276
Wait, Brian.

978
01:40:32,945 --> 01:40:34,029
Who are you guys?

979
01:40:34,113 --> 01:40:36,699
Uh... We help
people, ma'am.

980
01:40:38,075 --> 01:40:41,120
People who've been afflicted by...
Who's the lady?

981
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:44,540
What lady, honey?

982
01:40:44,623 --> 01:40:46,125
The lady standing behind them.

983
01:40:51,004 --> 01:40:52,005
Um...

984
01:40:52,631 --> 01:40:54,967
Our friend told us to tell you

985
01:40:55,050 --> 01:40:57,511
that Allison's
accident was no accident.

986
01:40:57,594 --> 01:41:01,265
When she was resuscitated
back to life at the hospital,

987
01:41:01,348 --> 01:41:02,975
she brought something
back with her.

988
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:05,394
Not just one
thing, many things.

989
01:41:05,477 --> 01:41:08,313
And they're living here
in this house with you.

990
01:41:10,774 --> 01:41:12,359
Allison.

991
01:41:16,405 --> 01:41:18,323
Allison.

992
01:41:39,303 --> 01:41:41,638
Oh, my God!
