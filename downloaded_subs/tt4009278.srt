00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:01,195
You're not supposed
to be here.

3
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:09,069
You know better.

4
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:15,375
It's a beautiful night.

5
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:20,681
Share it with me.

6
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:25,385
You can get yourself back in.

7
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:47,241
You're mad.

8
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:55,249
- Birdie.
- Don't call me that.

9
00:02:56,316 --> 00:02:59,384
We can skip your exercise.

10
00:02:59,418 --> 00:03:02,555
You fit that in last night.

11
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:05,323
I was...
trying to talk to you.

12
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:08,127
I'm not interested
in that talk.

13
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:11,731
- Anna...
- No.

14
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:26,112
It won't change anything.

15
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,596
Hey.

16
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:45,765
You must be Anna.

17
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,169
Who are you?

18
00:03:51,203 --> 00:03:52,972
Oh, sweetie,

19
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:56,442
did he not tell you
that I was coming?

20
00:03:56,476 --> 00:03:58,612
I'm the lawyer.

21
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,983
So your brother's
already approved these.

22
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:07,119
He's taken care of everything,
so when the time comes,

23
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:09,322
you won't have to make
any arrangements.

24
00:04:09,356 --> 00:04:12,225
I just need a signature.

25
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:17,463
Anna, I'm here to help Conrad
get what he wants.

26
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:20,467
What he wants is for you
to be taken care of.

27
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:28,940
My mother had it too.

28
00:04:28,974 --> 00:04:30,509
Not pancreatic, but...

29
00:04:30,543 --> 00:04:34,814
I do know how hard it is.

30
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:40,019
And acceptance is only a choice
that you can make.

31
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:45,759
Then I won't choose.

32
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:52,197
Submitted for your approval.

33
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:53,932
Today's offering:

34
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:55,500
meatloaf.

35
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:57,603
Loaf: confirmed. Meat:

36
00:04:57,637 --> 00:04:59,504
jury's out.

37
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:02,675
Green beans almondine:
nutty, beanie.

38
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:06,077
And the pièce de résistance?

39
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:08,447
Apple cobbler:

40
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:10,216
sweet, tart.

41
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,683
Uh-huh.

42
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:14,086
Uh... it's...

43
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,221
it's really good.

44
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:18,089
This a bad time?

45
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:20,125
No, she was just leaving.

46
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:23,028
As soon as I get a signature.

47
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,240
Okay, alright...

48
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:37,540
I got you.

49
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:40,045
Okay. Okay. It's okay.

50
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,692
I don't know how I'm gonna
do this without you.

51
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:55,728
Ah...

52
00:05:57,296 --> 00:06:00,399
I'll be with you.

53
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:03,603
You don't believe
in that stuff.

54
00:06:05,604 --> 00:06:09,408
I'm not talking
about that stuff.

55
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:12,711
I'm talking about us.

56
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:15,915
What we've been through
together.

57
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:21,622
You're stronger now
because of it.

58
00:06:24,457 --> 00:06:26,324
Hey...

59
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:31,596
you can't stay locked up
forever.

60
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,767
You have to get out
and be a part of the world.

61
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:38,303
I want to leave me alone.

62
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:41,307
That's not the way it works.

63
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:46,312
It's time to forgive Dad.

64
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:50,550
- Birdie...
- Stop.

65
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:56,490
I will never forgive him
for what he did.

66
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:00,326
Anna...

67
00:08:34,586 --> 00:08:37,923
I have terrible news.

68
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:42,427
Beef Stroganoff.

69
00:08:42,461 --> 00:08:45,263
But there's a glimmer of hope.

70
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:46,932
Tater tots!

71
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:08,686
Maybe it's good.

72
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,457
He's not suffering anymore.

73
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:16,328
There's gotta be some kind
of relief in that, right?

74
00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:19,464
You've been so strong
this whole time.

75
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:22,300
Never heard you complain.
Not once.

76
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:25,806
On this job, trust me,
it's rare.

77
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,709
It's not a relief.

78
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:36,315
Yeah... sorry,
that came out wrong.

79
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:38,316
All I mean is...

80
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,419
it's impressive, you know.

81
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:42,122
You're impressive.

82
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:48,493
So what's the plan, then?

83
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:52,330
Are you... gonna keep the place,
or...

84
00:09:52,364 --> 00:09:53,799
What?

85
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,502
Are you gonna keep the place?

86
00:09:56,536 --> 00:09:57,969
Oh, of course.

87
00:09:58,003 --> 00:09:59,905
Where would I go?

88
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:04,609
No, it's just some people need
to leave in order to move on.

89
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:07,514
But... this is my home.

90
00:10:08,547 --> 00:10:10,516
Yeah, okay.

91
00:10:17,556 --> 00:10:19,824
Could you leave that easily?

92
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:21,560
You know,
I shouldn't have asked.

93
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:24,662
No. Could you?

94
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:27,999
Well... not everybody feels
so strongly about home.

95
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:31,871
Not everybody feels
like they have a home.

96
00:10:33,705 --> 00:10:37,244
- Then why haven't you left?
- One guess.

97
00:10:38,411 --> 00:10:40,345
Girlfriend.

98
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:42,013
No.

99
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,019
I haven't really made the best
decisions in that department.

100
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:18,550
Whoa.

101
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:22,054
That's your last reason
for not leaving, right?

102
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:24,422
Uh, I...

103
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:26,058
I...

104
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:28,060
I can't take this.

105
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:31,729
No, I have more than I know
what to do with, honest.

106
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:33,598
Take it.

107
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:35,769
Make your escape.

108
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:45,743
I'm sorry.

109
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:48,014
I just can't.

110
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,646
<i>Hello.</i>

111
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,481
<i>You've reached
the Rook residence.</i>

112
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:24,916
<i>Conrad and Anna
aren't available right now.</i>

113
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,654
<i>If you leave a message,
I will return your call.</i>

114
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:30,421
<i>Hey, Anna.</i>

115
00:12:30,455 --> 00:12:32,858
<i>This is Charlotte.
I was just thinking about you,</i>

116
00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:36,795
<i>and I wanted to let you know
how proud I am of you for,</i>

117
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:38,664
<i>you know, facing your fears,</i>

118
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:41,666
and getting out there and
going to your brother's funeral.

119
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,036
<i>Um, so I guess
I'll see you there.</i>

120
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,137
<i>Okay, bye-bye.</i>

121
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:48,707
<i>Hey, Anna. This is Charlotte.</i>

122
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:52,044
<i>I know you've been struggling,
but you can do this.</i>

123
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,113
<i>I'll see you at the funeral,
sweetie. Stay strong.</i>

124
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:57,549
<i>Anna, are you there?</i>

125
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,386
<i>Anna, please pick up the phone.</i>

126
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,819
<i>Look, the funeral's starting.</i>

127
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:04,390
<i>If you leave now,
you can still make it.</i>

128
00:13:04,424 --> 00:13:05,991
<i>Please come.
I really hope you...</i>

129
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:59,744
Hey, go around back.

130
00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:02,214
And don't let anyone see you.

131
00:14:56,669 --> 00:15:00,807
Alright, let's make this quick.
You know what to look for.

132
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:42,447
What's that?

133
00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:08,541
Find her. Cut the phone line.

134
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:53,110
Ah!

135
00:17:53,144 --> 00:17:55,714
She's upstairs!

136
00:18:05,857 --> 00:18:07,993
What the hell?

137
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:32,818
You're not supposed to be here.

138
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:35,854
Please, stop looking at me.
Please, okay?

139
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:37,888
Explain it to me.

140
00:18:37,922 --> 00:18:40,359
Why aren't you
at your brother's funeral?

141
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:48,133
You're Anna, right?

142
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:51,002
Okay, Anna...

143
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:55,040
I need you
to be straight with me.

144
00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:57,610
I need to know
where you keep the money.

145
00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:01,980
What are you doing?

146
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:04,281
Always be prepared.

147
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:08,352
I'm sorry, prepared for what?
This is fucking crazy, JP.

148
00:19:08,386 --> 00:19:10,955
We should just fucking leave,
goddammit!

149
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:13,023
Use my name again,
why don't you?!

150
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:15,028
Go ahead!

151
00:19:16,862 --> 00:19:19,231
There's nothing
on the scanner.

152
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:22,867
So... looks like
she didn't call anybody.

153
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:25,070
Did you?

154
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:35,446
You're an odd bird.

155
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,883
Look at me.

156
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:42,354
Three men break into your home
and you don't call the police?

157
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:45,823
I was scared.
I... didn't have time to think.

158
00:19:45,857 --> 00:19:49,528
I have a solution.

159
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:53,197
Just a quick little love tap
behind the ear.

160
00:19:53,231 --> 00:19:56,134
We are not doing that!
We are not doing that!

161
00:19:56,168 --> 00:19:58,502
- Hey.
- Then we burn this fucker down.

162
00:19:58,536 --> 00:20:00,806
Fucking Chri...
you gonna stop this shit?

163
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,240
Hey, go make some coffee.

164
00:20:02,274 --> 00:20:04,909
- What?
- Go make some coffee.

165
00:20:04,943 --> 00:20:06,310
Go.

166
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:08,548
Let the adults talk.

167
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:11,717
Ah, fuck it.

168
00:20:17,456 --> 00:20:19,957
So?

169
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:21,760
We're not killing anyone.

170
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:29,166
Can I leave you alone with her
without making a mess of things?

171
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,302
- Of course.
- I mean it.

172
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:35,240
- I'm calm as fuck.
- Hey, I mean it.

173
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:41,247
Scout's honour.

174
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:50,120
They don't have any coffee.

175
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:51,589
Forget it.

176
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:53,358
I've got a plan.

177
00:20:53,392 --> 00:20:55,292
Ah, yeah?
You always got a plan.

178
00:20:55,326 --> 00:20:58,096
You always expect me
to be a part of it,

179
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,898
but I'm not Perry, okay?
I'm not your fucking lapdog!

180
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:04,302
Look, if you wanna leave,
this is the time to go.

181
00:21:06,471 --> 00:21:08,640
Really?

182
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:15,848
What about you?

183
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:19,050
I'm still thinking it through.

184
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:21,485
Look, I could get the money.

185
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,155
This shit just got
a little complicated.

186
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:25,624
Yeah, a little.

187
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:28,193
Look, you're still clean,
little brother.

188
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:30,595
Let's keep it that way, okay?

189
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:34,598
Come on, man,
you know I need this money too.

190
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:37,234
Does that mean
you're with me on this, huh?

191
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:39,471
All the way.

192
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:41,239
All the way.

193
00:21:41,273 --> 00:21:43,910
Let's go find it.

194
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:56,687
Jesus.

195
00:21:56,721 --> 00:21:59,223
Fucking mess, man.

196
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:10,234
What was that before?

197
00:22:10,268 --> 00:22:12,503
Just leave me alone, please.

198
00:22:12,537 --> 00:22:14,438
You were gone.

199
00:22:14,472 --> 00:22:17,542
Why didn't you run?

200
00:22:19,711 --> 00:22:21,512
Nowhere to go.

201
00:22:21,546 --> 00:22:23,682
That's not it.

202
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,686
There's something else going on.

203
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,923
Hmm?

204
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:45,237
What's in there?

205
00:22:50,476 --> 00:22:54,247
Vance, just get started.
I'm gonna get this room.

206
00:23:00,451 --> 00:23:03,754
- Ow.
- You gotta be shitting me.

207
00:23:03,788 --> 00:23:07,425
So you're telling me
you haven't left this house...

208
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:09,426
in over 10 years?

209
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,763
Yeah.

210
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:17,303
Okay.

211
00:23:18,469 --> 00:23:22,307
I can just leave this door open.

212
00:23:22,341 --> 00:23:25,242
I can go make myself
a cup of tea.

213
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:28,413
When I come back...

214
00:23:28,447 --> 00:23:30,650
...you're still sitting there?

215
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:36,620
That's crazy.

216
00:23:38,356 --> 00:23:40,157
Ah, fuck, that's sad.

217
00:23:40,191 --> 00:23:42,662
This is actually really sad.

218
00:23:52,703 --> 00:23:55,272
Hey, you know what?

219
00:23:55,306 --> 00:23:57,809
I think I can help you.

220
00:24:00,245 --> 00:24:02,547
No, no, no!

221
00:24:02,581 --> 00:24:04,648
- No! No!!
- Huh? C'mere!

222
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:07,385
Stop, please!
Please, please, please!

223
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:10,155
- C'mere! C'mere!
- Please stop! Stop!

224
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:21,534
No, no, no...

225
00:24:27,405 --> 00:24:29,206
See?

226
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,774
It's not so bad.

227
00:24:30,808 --> 00:24:34,479
I got you. I got you. Okay.
What the hell did you do?

228
00:24:34,513 --> 00:24:37,381
She doesn't go outside.
I was just trying to show her.

229
00:24:37,415 --> 00:24:38,782
You gonna be okay?

230
00:24:38,816 --> 00:24:42,186
Perry, go inside.

231
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,423
Hey, I need you to focus.

232
00:24:45,457 --> 00:24:48,393
- Let me back in!
- Hey, hey, we go back inside,

233
00:24:48,427 --> 00:24:50,494
- Perry's gonna kill you.
- I don't care.

234
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:53,031
Please!!!

235
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:04,242
Anna. Anna, we looked upstairs
and we didn't find anything.

236
00:25:04,276 --> 00:25:07,412
Look, is there an attic?

237
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:10,415
Huh? Huh? Safe?

238
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:12,416
Basement?

239
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,685
Huh? Huh?

240
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:18,423
Basement? Huh? Basement?

241
00:25:18,457 --> 00:25:22,760
Okay.
Okay, let's get you back inside.

242
00:25:22,794 --> 00:25:26,065
Take her upstairs,
get her cleaned up.

243
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:32,169
Well, you had your chance
to leave.

244
00:25:32,203 --> 00:25:35,439
Look, don't make me regret
letting you stay.

245
00:25:35,473 --> 00:25:37,075
Fuck.

246
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:47,452
God-fuckin'...

247
00:25:59,965 --> 00:26:02,802
Put these on.

248
00:26:13,644 --> 00:26:17,615
Hey, you sure you don't
want me to look after her?

249
00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:19,817
- After what you just pulled?
- I'm just saying,

250
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:22,486
do you really think
Vance is up for this?

251
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,355
He'll be fine.

252
00:26:30,661 --> 00:26:33,431
You gonna tell me
what we're doing down here?

253
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:36,502
Trust me, man,
we hit the jackpot.

254
00:26:39,904 --> 00:26:41,638
Yeah...

255
00:26:41,672 --> 00:26:43,741
Jackpot.

256
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,150
Uh... what the hell?

257
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:57,655
Oh, you like sitting around
in your own pee. Got it.

258
00:26:57,689 --> 00:27:00,358
Just change, please.

259
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:03,194
I... I can't. Ahem.

260
00:27:12,903 --> 00:27:14,672
Ouch.

261
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:16,709
Sorry.

262
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:20,913
Fuck!

263
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,416
Come over here man.
Gimme a hand with this.

264
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,685
I'm more curious
what's behind door number two.

265
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,553
Why's that?

266
00:27:29,587 --> 00:27:31,557
No handle.

267
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:44,801
Uh...

268
00:27:44,835 --> 00:27:47,539
it can be hard...

269
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:50,340
...to be with someone

270
00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:53,511
who has
such a strong personality.

271
00:27:53,545 --> 00:27:54,878
I can tell...

272
00:27:54,912 --> 00:27:57,314
you're just going along.

273
00:27:57,348 --> 00:27:59,217
I can see it.

274
00:28:02,754 --> 00:28:05,557
Don't you fucking shrink me.

275
00:28:06,624 --> 00:28:07,992
Ow.

276
00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:11,729
Don't think I've dealt
with this my entire life?

277
00:28:11,763 --> 00:28:14,898
Maybe I was the one
who found out about this place.

278
00:28:14,932 --> 00:28:16,733
You ever think about that?

279
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:20,504
I mean, maybe this whole thing
was my idea?

280
00:28:20,538 --> 00:28:22,973
I don't think you realize
how serious this is.

281
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:25,009
- No, I do.
- You've seen our faces.

282
00:28:25,043 --> 00:28:26,910
You know our names.

283
00:28:26,944 --> 00:28:30,248
You really think
we're just gonna let you go?

284
00:28:31,482 --> 00:28:33,617
Now put on
the fucking sweatpants!

285
00:28:33,651 --> 00:28:34,985
Stop!

286
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:36,921
- Please, stop!
- Stop moving, goddammit!

287
00:28:36,955 --> 00:28:38,755
- Stop! Stop...
- Hey! What the hell?!

288
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:41,059
- Stop it!
- Hey! Get the fuck off her!

289
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:44,028
- It's not what it looks like!
- What are you doing?

290
00:28:44,062 --> 00:28:45,929
- Honestly...
- Are you okay?

291
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:48,598
...you gotta listen to me!
She wasn't supposed to be here.

292
00:28:48,632 --> 00:28:50,335
- Listen to me, Danny, please!
- Get back!

293
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:53,604
Dan...
you guys know each other?

294
00:28:53,638 --> 00:28:55,072
Yes, but that's not...

295
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:56,808
- No, no.
- Anna, Anna,

296
00:28:56,842 --> 00:28:59,077
- I had nothing to do with this.
- You cannot be here.

297
00:28:59,111 --> 00:29:01,044
- You gotta get out of here, okay?
- Oh, shit!

298
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:03,880
- Get back.
- You cannot be here, Danny.

299
00:29:03,914 --> 00:29:06,751
Honest, if we knew
she was gonna be here...

300
00:29:06,785 --> 00:29:08,953
- What do you mean, "we"?
- Danny boy.

301
00:29:08,987 --> 00:29:10,687
Leave him alone, dude!

302
00:29:10,721 --> 00:29:13,791
- Don't fucking touch me.
- Where is she?

303
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:15,728
Huh?

304
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,963
Fuck.

305
00:29:18,997 --> 00:29:20,998
- Hey, hey, hey!
- What?!

306
00:29:21,032 --> 00:29:23,235
Do you know
how this has to end?

307
00:29:24,702 --> 00:29:26,838
We can't let her go.

308
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:31,677
Just find her.

309
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:35,847
Come on.

310
00:29:59,136 --> 00:30:01,439
You like to disappear,
don't you?

311
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:07,179
Come out and play, little girl.

312
00:30:13,051 --> 00:30:16,820
I got a few tricks of my own.

313
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,903
C'mere.

314
00:30:36,775 --> 00:30:40,011
For my next trick,
I would like to invite

315
00:30:40,045 --> 00:30:42,213
my lovely assistant
to the stage.

316
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:45,951
Anna, would you be so kind
as to join us?

317
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:50,221
I don't think she's coming.

318
00:30:50,255 --> 00:30:52,758
It's really too bad.

319
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:56,226
She would've been
of great value to us.

320
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,397
I guess I'll have to do this
on my own.

321
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,276
Hey. Perry!

322
00:31:16,515 --> 00:31:19,015
- Open wide, Dan.
- What the fuck?

323
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:21,953
Stupid thing didn't talk.

324
00:32:20,178 --> 00:32:23,048
- Ah! Oh!
- I found her!

325
00:32:24,716 --> 00:32:27,918
- You got her?
- Yeah, I got her!

326
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:31,121
Get the fuck off there! Please.

327
00:32:31,155 --> 00:32:33,089
Don't you understand
I'm the least

328
00:32:33,123 --> 00:32:35,326
of your fucking worries
right now?! Please!

329
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:03,354
Come on.

330
00:33:03,388 --> 00:33:06,123
He's taking his time.

331
00:33:06,157 --> 00:33:09,859
If he loses her,
we'll find her.

332
00:33:09,893 --> 00:33:12,029
Put out some breadcrumbs,
she'll come.

333
00:33:13,797 --> 00:33:16,099
Come on, man, be serious.

334
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:18,237
Maybe I am.

335
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:34,385
You got her?

336
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,000
You hear that?

337
00:34:00,277 --> 00:34:02,547
Stay.

338
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,593
No! No!

339
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:18,262
Vance!

340
00:34:18,296 --> 00:34:19,897
Vance!!

341
00:34:19,931 --> 00:34:21,265
Vance!!!

342
00:34:21,299 --> 00:34:23,401
Vance!

343
00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:25,971
Wake up!!

344
00:34:27,772 --> 00:34:29,372
Is he dead?

345
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:31,242
Argh...

346
00:34:31,276 --> 00:34:34,377
Ah, goddamn. Argh...

347
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:36,614
Ah, Vance.

348
00:34:46,123 --> 00:34:48,359
Hey. Hey! Hey, you, open!

349
00:34:48,393 --> 00:34:53,098
Open it, you fucking bitch!
Open the fucking door!

350
00:35:00,872 --> 00:35:02,606
Anna!

351
00:35:04,341 --> 00:35:06,010
Anna...

352
00:35:06,044 --> 00:35:08,144
Come on!

353
00:35:25,062 --> 00:35:27,198
Hello?

354
00:35:42,513 --> 00:35:45,916
Hey, JP, something weird
is going on here, man.

355
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,487
Come on, we gotta
get the fuck outta here.

356
00:35:55,893 --> 00:35:58,195
Oh, fuck.

357
00:36:04,868 --> 00:36:07,805
You bitch!
You fucking bitch!!

358
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,541
Get down here!

359
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:26,557
Argh!

360
00:36:26,591 --> 00:36:28,726
Fucking bitch!

361
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:31,762
Argh!

362
00:37:03,594 --> 00:37:07,364
Is she making fucking tea?

363
00:37:20,178 --> 00:37:22,580
Hey, nothing in here's
gonna get us up there.

364
00:37:22,614 --> 00:37:24,615
Let's drag
this fucking cabinet in there.

365
00:37:24,649 --> 00:37:26,885
It's bolted to the wall.

366
00:37:40,665 --> 00:37:43,200
- Goddammit!
- Doesn't matter.

367
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:45,501
She was behind
that fucking door,

368
00:37:45,535 --> 00:37:48,638
and then she was up there,
like that!

369
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,406
The bitch doesn't have wings.

370
00:37:52,343 --> 00:37:53,977
Anna!

371
00:37:54,011 --> 00:37:56,514
Anna. Help me.

372
00:37:58,049 --> 00:37:59,684
Hurry!

373
00:38:01,986 --> 00:38:04,322
Cut me loose.

374
00:38:06,223 --> 00:38:09,026
Robbing me...
during Conrad's funeral?

375
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,593
No, no.

376
00:38:10,627 --> 00:38:14,198
- They did this, not me!
- Then what are you doing here?

377
00:38:14,232 --> 00:38:17,669
I... I wanted
to be there for you.

378
00:38:22,073 --> 00:38:23,673
You...

379
00:38:23,707 --> 00:38:25,408
you went?

380
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:27,510
You didn't show.

381
00:38:27,544 --> 00:38:29,680
I got worried.

382
00:38:29,714 --> 00:38:32,348
Was it...

383
00:38:32,382 --> 00:38:34,450
was it nice?

384
00:38:34,484 --> 00:38:38,388
It... it was peaceful.

385
00:38:38,422 --> 00:38:40,692
Nobody came?

386
00:38:42,093 --> 00:38:44,595
No, uh, it was me and...

387
00:38:44,629 --> 00:38:47,064
Charlotte and the priest.

388
00:38:47,098 --> 00:38:48,531
He gave a good talk.

389
00:38:48,565 --> 00:38:51,968
It was... it was really nice.

390
00:38:52,002 --> 00:38:53,704
It's okay.

391
00:38:53,738 --> 00:38:56,372
You know, it was...

392
00:38:56,406 --> 00:38:58,542
just me and him.

393
00:38:58,576 --> 00:39:01,246
We only had each other.

394
00:39:10,288 --> 00:39:12,722
Do you know
you've been bringing us food

395
00:39:12,756 --> 00:39:15,258
for almost a year?

396
00:39:15,292 --> 00:39:17,260
I checked the calendar.

397
00:39:17,294 --> 00:39:19,263
Almost to the day.

398
00:39:19,297 --> 00:39:22,566
It feels like longer,
doesn't it?

399
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,401
A-Anna.

400
00:39:24,435 --> 00:39:27,137
Is that how you do it?

401
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:28,738
You go into people's homes
and...

402
00:39:28,772 --> 00:39:31,441
...steal their things
and then you call your friends

403
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:34,644
- to go and steal all of it?
- They're not my friends!

404
00:39:34,678 --> 00:39:38,582
Well... Vance is, but...

405
00:39:38,616 --> 00:39:40,517
...not the other two.

406
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:43,220
You told him about the money?

407
00:39:43,254 --> 00:39:44,754
I... I...

408
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:46,557
I told him about you.

409
00:39:46,591 --> 00:39:48,524
I told him about your situation.

410
00:39:48,558 --> 00:39:52,262
And, yeah, I told him
you tried to give me money.

411
00:39:52,296 --> 00:39:55,631
It took me off-guard.
I didn't mean...

412
00:39:55,665 --> 00:39:58,635
I... I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

413
00:39:58,669 --> 00:40:01,639
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

414
00:40:06,643 --> 00:40:10,314
You know,
I almost believe you this time.

415
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:13,383
Listen to me.
I get if you hate me,

416
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:16,285
but you have to believe...

417
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,523
I would never hurt you.

418
00:40:22,393 --> 00:40:24,160
What happened to you?

419
00:40:24,194 --> 00:40:27,031
W-w-why don't you leave
the house?

420
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:33,571
I haven't left the house
since Daddy died.

421
00:40:36,841 --> 00:40:40,477
Whenever I had a problem,
I could always ask Connie.

422
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:42,178
Hmm...

423
00:40:42,212 --> 00:40:45,717
He always knew
how to handle any situation.

424
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:52,023
How would he handle this one?

425
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:04,200
Oh!!

426
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:08,807
Ow!! Ow!!

427
00:41:20,718 --> 00:41:23,086
If you meant what you said
in there,

428
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,787
then you have to trust me.

429
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:26,423
I do.

430
00:41:26,457 --> 00:41:29,526
Then you have to jump.

431
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,227
No!

432
00:41:31,261 --> 00:41:34,397
It'll be much safer
if you turn around.

433
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:37,767
- I'm not... I'm not doing that.
- None of this would've happened

434
00:41:37,801 --> 00:41:40,471
if you would've just taken
the money!

435
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,676
You're not like this.

436
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,678
You have no idea
what I'm like.

437
00:41:47,712 --> 00:41:50,048
Ah!

438
00:42:21,745 --> 00:42:25,448
<i>You don't know me.</i>

439
00:42:25,482 --> 00:42:27,216
<i>Help me!</i>

440
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,653
- What the fuck are you doing?!
- Hey! Shut up!

441
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:31,555
Fuck, man.

442
00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:32,923
Fuck...

443
00:42:32,957 --> 00:42:34,624
Please help.

444
00:42:34,658 --> 00:42:36,392
Alright, fine.

445
00:42:36,426 --> 00:42:37,861
Fuckin' let me
take a look at it.

446
00:42:37,895 --> 00:42:41,466
Oh... Caref... Ow.

447
00:42:46,803 --> 00:42:49,673
Careful, careful... Ow.

448
00:42:49,707 --> 00:42:52,408
- Oh.
- What, is it bad?

449
00:42:52,442 --> 00:42:54,211
Fuck, it's bad.

450
00:42:54,245 --> 00:42:55,778
Kneecap's dislocated.

451
00:42:55,812 --> 00:42:57,815
Fuck.

452
00:43:00,817 --> 00:43:03,486
Okay...

453
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,821
I'm gonna have to pop it
back into place

454
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:09,258
before the swelling is too bad
I won't be able to, okay?

455
00:43:09,292 --> 00:43:11,495
- Dan.
- Huh?

456
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,597
It's gonna hurt.

457
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:16,233
Oh...

458
00:43:18,835 --> 00:43:20,604
JP.

459
00:43:20,638 --> 00:43:22,974
Hey! JP.

460
00:43:24,475 --> 00:43:26,945
Hold his body down.

461
00:43:31,848 --> 00:43:33,984
Hold him down here.

462
00:43:44,328 --> 00:43:46,463
Three, two...

463
00:43:56,873 --> 00:43:58,975
That was kinda fun.

464
00:44:05,049 --> 00:44:07,018
<i>You're alright.</i>

465
00:44:12,589 --> 00:44:14,323
Thank you.

466
00:44:14,357 --> 00:44:17,060
Whatever.

467
00:44:22,433 --> 00:44:24,600
Vance?

468
00:44:24,634 --> 00:44:26,035
Vance!

469
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:28,738
- He's dead. Shut the fuck up!
- Hey, let it go.

470
00:44:28,772 --> 00:44:31,675
Let it go? We had her
until this shitheel showed up.

471
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:33,843
I said we should do this
just us.

472
00:44:33,877 --> 00:44:36,747
You didn't want to.
I said take care of that bitch.

473
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:38,414
You said no.

474
00:44:38,448 --> 00:44:40,316
Now we're stuck
in a fucking basement

475
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:43,687
with one live piece of shit
and one dead one!

476
00:44:43,721 --> 00:44:46,455
Fuck you!
Get a hold of yourself.

477
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:50,327
I'm a hold!
I'm a hold of my fucking self!

478
00:44:50,361 --> 00:44:53,430
Just re-evaluate your fucking
priorities, okay, JP?

479
00:44:53,464 --> 00:44:56,399
I'm not the one who's slipping.

480
00:44:58,736 --> 00:45:01,037
JP. JP!

481
00:45:01,071 --> 00:45:02,571
J...

482
00:45:02,605 --> 00:45:04,208
JP?

483
00:45:09,747 --> 00:45:11,481
- Are you okay?
- I...

484
00:45:11,515 --> 00:45:14,517
I... I need to go to a hospital.

485
00:45:14,551 --> 00:45:17,687
I can't... I can't take you
to the hospital.

486
00:45:17,721 --> 00:45:19,789
- No kidding.
- You can't even check

487
00:45:19,823 --> 00:45:21,925
your fucking mail,
you psycho bitch.

488
00:45:21,959 --> 00:45:24,461
- Don't call me that.
- What?

489
00:45:24,495 --> 00:45:26,863
Psycho, or bitch?

490
00:45:26,897 --> 00:45:29,098
We could all stop this.
Let's all stop, okay?

491
00:45:29,132 --> 00:45:30,934
Are you retarded?!

492
00:45:30,968 --> 00:45:34,104
She's not gonna come down here
and fucking save you, Dan!

493
00:45:34,138 --> 00:45:35,838
Can't you get him
under control?

494
00:45:35,872 --> 00:45:38,075
No one fucking controls me,
do you understand?!

495
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:40,343
Okay...

496
00:45:40,377 --> 00:45:43,146
That's what you get!

497
00:45:44,582 --> 00:45:47,718
I'm cool. I'm okay, JP.

498
00:45:47,752 --> 00:45:49,385
Just breathe.

499
00:45:49,419 --> 00:45:52,388
There's a first-aid kit.

500
00:45:52,422 --> 00:45:55,492
- So go get it.
- No.

501
00:45:55,526 --> 00:45:57,928
- Down there.
- It's locked.

502
00:45:57,962 --> 00:46:00,030
Try again.

503
00:46:07,772 --> 00:46:10,775
Don't go anywhere.

504
00:46:25,556 --> 00:46:28,457
Oh, fuck!
Hey, open this stupid door!

505
00:46:28,491 --> 00:46:30,426
What's in there?

506
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:33,162
What the fuck?!

507
00:46:35,732 --> 00:46:38,468
Ah...

508
00:46:38,502 --> 00:46:40,002
Perry!

509
00:46:40,036 --> 00:46:42,039
Goddamn!

510
00:46:56,587 --> 00:46:59,123
What the fuck?

511
00:47:33,256 --> 00:47:36,793
Fucking bitch!

512
00:47:47,837 --> 00:47:50,807
Get me outta here!

513
00:47:52,843 --> 00:47:54,477
Hello?

514
00:47:54,511 --> 00:47:56,513
Can you guys hear me?

515
00:47:56,547 --> 00:47:58,814
Yo, Perry, are you there?

516
00:47:58,848 --> 00:48:01,818
- Aren't you gonna do something?
- Oh...

517
00:48:01,852 --> 00:48:03,653
like what?

518
00:48:03,687 --> 00:48:05,789
Get him outta there.

519
00:48:05,823 --> 00:48:07,791
Get him outta there...

520
00:48:07,825 --> 00:48:10,827
Why didn't I think of that?

521
00:48:10,861 --> 00:48:13,696
I should've thought of that.
God, what a fucking idiot.

522
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,698
What an idiot.
Okay, here we go.

523
00:48:15,732 --> 00:48:17,700
We're just gonna
get him outta there.

524
00:48:17,734 --> 00:48:20,003
You just stay seated,
you fucking cripple.

525
00:48:21,538 --> 00:48:23,840
JP, come on out!

526
00:48:25,709 --> 00:48:27,843
Come on, buddy. Huh.

527
00:48:27,877 --> 00:48:29,879
Quit fucking around.

528
00:48:29,913 --> 00:48:33,517
Get me the fuck outta here!

529
00:48:33,551 --> 00:48:35,184
The door seems to be locked.

530
00:48:35,218 --> 00:48:37,053
Do you remember
when that happened?

531
00:48:37,087 --> 00:48:38,821
- What's going on out there?!
- Forget it.

532
00:48:38,855 --> 00:48:40,624
Is that probably
when the door closed?

533
00:48:40,658 --> 00:48:44,026
Did you hear
the locking mechanism?

534
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,995
Hmm...

535
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,010
Yeah.

536
00:49:00,044 --> 00:49:02,546
This'll do.

537
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,213
Come on, big fella.

538
00:49:04,247 --> 00:49:07,551
Goddamn, you fat fuck.

539
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:14,723
What are you doing?

540
00:49:14,757 --> 00:49:18,596
Putting him in the doorway.
What's it look like?

541
00:49:19,763 --> 00:49:21,830
He's my friend.

542
00:49:21,864 --> 00:49:24,901
He was your friend.
Now, he's a doorstop.

543
00:49:26,703 --> 00:49:28,571
- Hmm?
- Ah...

544
00:49:28,605 --> 00:49:30,541
Fuck.

545
00:49:46,756 --> 00:49:49,225
Fuck you!

546
00:49:52,962 --> 00:49:54,931
Fuck.

547
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:32,369
Hey... JP.

548
00:50:33,837 --> 00:50:36,138
We're gonna get you out.

549
00:50:36,172 --> 00:50:38,707
Perry's looking for something.

550
00:50:38,741 --> 00:50:40,809
He won't find anything.

551
00:50:42,779 --> 00:50:45,280
He might.

552
00:50:45,314 --> 00:50:49,152
Open it,
you fucking nutty cunt!

553
00:50:52,321 --> 00:50:55,458
Dan... listen to me.

554
00:50:58,127 --> 00:51:01,132
You know
she's not gonna let us go.

555
00:51:03,132 --> 00:51:04,968
Can you blame her?

556
00:51:05,002 --> 00:51:07,736
You were gonna kill her
an hour ago.

557
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:09,972
Come on.

558
00:51:10,006 --> 00:51:12,309
I was just playing.

559
00:51:13,477 --> 00:51:15,980
Look where it got you.

560
00:51:21,151 --> 00:51:23,320
JP!

561
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:28,992
She's gonna pay for it.

562
00:52:14,471 --> 00:52:16,507
Fuck this.

563
00:52:24,547 --> 00:52:26,950
JP?

564
00:52:26,984 --> 00:52:29,986
JP?

565
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:33,124
JP, I think
I'm on the other side of you.

566
00:52:38,094 --> 00:52:40,897
Can you hear me?

567
00:52:40,931 --> 00:52:44,167
There's a fucking noose in here.

568
00:52:44,201 --> 00:52:46,070
Hey, Perry!

569
00:52:49,071 --> 00:52:51,074
Can you hear me?

570
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:01,552
Fuck.

571
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:49,524
Nice one.

572
00:55:41,277 --> 00:55:43,413
Hello?

573
00:55:45,348 --> 00:55:47,417
Anna?

574
00:55:51,288 --> 00:55:52,689
Hello?

575
00:55:52,723 --> 00:55:54,892
Anna?

576
00:56:12,676 --> 00:56:14,612
Hello?

577
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:34,296
Is everything okay?

578
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,064
Everything's fine.

579
00:56:36,098 --> 00:56:38,700
Are you okay?

580
00:56:38,734 --> 00:56:40,602
Just...

581
00:56:40,636 --> 00:56:43,641
just a little accident.

582
00:56:50,513 --> 00:56:53,549
Is that Dan's car out front?

583
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,365
Oh!

584
00:57:09,399 --> 00:57:13,468
Dan came to check on me
because I wasn't at the funeral.

585
00:57:13,502 --> 00:57:16,472
So he broke in?

586
00:57:16,506 --> 00:57:18,341
I didn't answer the door,

587
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:21,644
and he was worried
I was gonna do something bad.

588
00:57:21,678 --> 00:57:24,713
Is there something going on
between you two?

589
00:57:24,747 --> 00:57:27,182
- What? No.
- I knew there was something.

590
00:57:27,216 --> 00:57:29,618
I saw it the other day
when he came over.

591
00:57:29,652 --> 00:57:32,388
Well, I-I've just been so, um,

592
00:57:32,422 --> 00:57:35,191
lonely since Conrad got sick
and I...

593
00:57:35,225 --> 00:57:38,260
Oh, shhh. Honey, it's okay.

594
00:57:38,294 --> 00:57:42,365
Hey, you're going through
a rough time.

595
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:46,202
You've done nothing wrong.

596
00:57:46,236 --> 00:57:50,106
And if you can't believe that,
you know what you need to do?

597
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,075
No.

598
00:57:52,109 --> 00:57:54,510
Forgive yourself.

599
00:57:54,544 --> 00:57:57,680
Come here.

600
00:57:57,714 --> 00:58:00,816
I'll try.

601
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:21,137
I'll call you in a few days
just to see how you're doing.

602
00:58:23,406 --> 00:58:25,776
That's nice, thanks.

603
00:58:29,546 --> 00:58:32,647
What is that?

604
00:58:37,587 --> 00:58:40,256
Radiator.

605
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:42,459
Help!

606
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,896
It's... an old house.

607
00:58:49,366 --> 00:58:53,170
Dan's taking a look at it
for me.

608
00:58:56,772 --> 00:58:58,740
Oh. So sweet.

609
00:58:58,774 --> 00:59:01,778
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

610
01:00:08,477 --> 01:00:11,147
You're in a lot of pain,
aren't you?

611
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:17,920
Come on, I'll help you.

612
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:35,138
What'd you do?

613
01:00:40,944 --> 01:00:43,713
Have a seat.

614
01:00:45,714 --> 01:00:48,251
Now lift your legs up.

615
01:00:48,285 --> 01:00:50,554
- Please...
- Now.

616
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,563
You'll understand soon.

617
01:01:43,939 --> 01:01:46,408
What the fuck?

618
01:01:46,442 --> 01:01:47,910
Fuck!

619
01:01:47,944 --> 01:01:50,379
Fuck! God!

620
01:01:50,413 --> 01:01:52,747
Argh! Girly-girl!

621
01:01:52,781 --> 01:01:56,452
You sneaky little fuck!

622
01:01:56,486 --> 01:01:58,255
Argh!

623
01:02:04,127 --> 01:02:06,461
Fuck!

624
01:02:06,495 --> 01:02:09,632
I didn't know you were invited,
Dan.

625
01:02:11,567 --> 01:02:13,636
Perry's dead.

626
01:02:15,971 --> 01:02:19,742
There's a body in the freezer.

627
01:02:19,776 --> 01:02:21,943
Yeah...
You could tell me

628
01:02:21,977 --> 01:02:25,113
there's a unicorn in the attic,
I wouldn't be surprised.

629
01:02:25,147 --> 01:02:27,615
What is this place?

630
01:02:27,649 --> 01:02:29,819
Fucked up, right?

631
01:02:31,687 --> 01:02:35,691
I mean, there's another one
like it upstairs.

632
01:02:35,725 --> 01:02:39,663
Why would you make...
the exact... bedroom?

633
01:02:47,002 --> 01:02:50,138
Are you back there, Anna?

634
01:02:50,172 --> 01:02:52,842
You watching us?

635
01:03:05,187 --> 01:03:06,821
Fu...

636
01:03:08,725 --> 01:03:10,926
We're your zoo animals now?
Huh?

637
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,697
You gonna observe us
in captivity?

638
01:03:16,732 --> 01:03:18,969
Fuck.

639
01:03:22,038 --> 01:03:24,106
<i>Argh!</i>

640
01:03:26,042 --> 01:03:28,878
- Take it easy.
- Fuck!

641
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:33,983
<i>You can't break it.</i>

642
01:03:35,451 --> 01:03:37,887
<i>It's bulletproof.</i>

643
01:03:37,921 --> 01:03:39,688
You...

644
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:46,428
There's a shirt
in the dresser.

645
01:03:46,462 --> 01:03:48,197
<i>Put it on.</i>

646
01:03:52,768 --> 01:03:54,736
You know, something tells me

647
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:57,071
we're not your first guests
here.

648
01:03:57,105 --> 01:04:01,075
<i>You're sitting behind
your little desk, aren't you?</i>

649
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:03,879
- <i>Huh?</i>
- No.

650
01:04:03,913 --> 01:04:06,080
<i>What's your game, huh?</i>

651
01:04:06,114 --> 01:04:09,618
<i>Who do you watch back there?</i>

652
01:04:09,652 --> 01:04:11,053
<i>What do you do?</i>

653
01:04:11,087 --> 01:04:12,787
Put on the shirt.

654
01:04:12,821 --> 01:04:14,756
What do you do, huh?

655
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:16,591
Daddy issues?

656
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:19,227
- <i>Just put on the shirt.</i>
- Or else what?

657
01:04:19,261 --> 01:04:22,997
- <i>Conrad will come.</i>
- Conrad's the dead guy?

658
01:04:23,031 --> 01:04:26,769
You're making it worse.

659
01:04:26,803 --> 01:04:29,205
Anna?

660
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:32,207
Anna, please open the door.

661
01:04:32,241 --> 01:04:36,512
Not yet.
Not until he puts on the shirt.

662
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:42,852
Fine! I'll put your shirt on.

663
01:04:42,886 --> 01:04:45,489
I'll play your game.

664
01:04:47,957 --> 01:04:50,658
<i>We're gonna figure this out,
Anna.</i>

665
01:04:50,692 --> 01:04:53,028
<i>You wanna start?</i>

666
01:04:53,062 --> 01:04:56,097
<i>No?!</i>

667
01:04:56,131 --> 01:04:59,135
Fine. I like puzzles.

668
01:05:00,636 --> 01:05:04,206
So you trap some poor fuck
in here...

669
01:05:07,843 --> 01:05:10,111
Conrad sneaks through here.

670
01:05:10,145 --> 01:05:12,280
<i>Yeah?</i>

671
01:05:12,314 --> 01:05:14,817
Fucking airlock?

672
01:05:16,152 --> 01:05:17,952
And he kills them.

673
01:05:17,986 --> 01:05:19,821
Hmm.

674
01:05:19,855 --> 01:05:21,122
Alright.

675
01:05:21,156 --> 01:05:23,559
Simple enough, right?

676
01:05:23,593 --> 01:05:25,528
Just stop.

677
01:05:25,562 --> 01:05:28,664
But if Conrad wants
to kill these guys,

678
01:05:28,698 --> 01:05:31,835
why's he put them in here first?

679
01:05:35,004 --> 01:05:37,240
So you could talk to them.

680
01:05:42,011 --> 01:05:43,979
I... I didn't talk to them.

681
01:05:44,013 --> 01:05:46,483
<i>So it's Conrad, then, huh?</i>

682
01:05:47,783 --> 01:05:49,318
What does he say?

683
01:05:49,352 --> 01:05:52,687
No, no, no, no, wrong question.

684
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:55,591
What does he want from them?
That's the question.

685
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:59,563
And what did he do when
he didn't get what he wants?

686
01:06:01,196 --> 01:06:03,332
Hey, you hungry?

687
01:06:05,368 --> 01:06:07,068
Fuck you.

688
01:06:07,102 --> 01:06:09,171
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

689
01:06:09,205 --> 01:06:11,006
No, no, no, no, no...

690
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:14,211
Perry said there's a noose
in the other room.

691
01:06:16,379 --> 01:06:19,714
You drugged their food.

692
01:06:19,748 --> 01:06:22,017
Then Conrad came in,

693
01:06:22,051 --> 01:06:25,354
drug them out...

694
01:06:25,388 --> 01:06:27,256
...and he strung them up.

695
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:28,756
Stop talking.

696
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:30,825
<i>You know what?</i>

697
01:06:30,859 --> 01:06:33,829
<i>I hate to break it to you,
darling,</i>

698
01:06:33,863 --> 01:06:37,198
<i>but there's no one coming
through that door tonight.</i>

699
01:06:37,232 --> 01:06:39,734
- <i>Conrad's gone.</i>
- Shut up!

700
01:06:39,768 --> 01:06:42,137
You're twisting it around
and you're...

701
01:06:42,171 --> 01:06:44,238
<i>making it sound all wrong!</i>

702
01:06:44,272 --> 01:06:46,908
But... but it's true?

703
01:06:46,942 --> 01:06:50,447
You watched Conrad kill people?

704
01:07:08,964 --> 01:07:10,932
So what?

705
01:07:10,966 --> 01:07:13,001
Supposed to absolve you?

706
01:07:13,035 --> 01:07:14,236
Wh-wh-what is it?

707
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:16,940
They were killing perverts.

708
01:07:21,109 --> 01:07:23,678
<i>We weren't doing a bad thing.</i>

709
01:07:23,712 --> 01:07:25,948
<i>You have to believe me.</i>

710
01:07:25,982 --> 01:07:28,182
Murder's murder.

711
01:07:28,216 --> 01:07:29,952
No! We were fixing them!

712
01:07:29,986 --> 01:07:31,419
<i>Is that
what you'd tell yourselves?</i>

713
01:07:31,453 --> 01:07:34,356
<i>It's the truth!
They needed our help.</i>

714
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:37,292
<i>They were sick,
just like Daddy was.</i>

715
01:07:37,326 --> 01:07:40,262
<i>He said he loved me all along,</i>

716
01:07:40,296 --> 01:07:44,300
<i>but... that didn't stop him
from doing what he did to me.</i>

717
01:07:45,902 --> 01:07:47,903
It wasn't so bad after a while,

718
01:07:47,937 --> 01:07:51,906
'cause he would hold me
afterwards and...

719
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:55,109
Conrad stopped him?

720
01:07:55,143 --> 01:07:56,979
<i>Yeah, he saved me.</i>

721
01:07:57,013 --> 01:07:59,448
<i>He wrapped the sheet
around father's neck</i>

722
01:07:59,482 --> 01:08:03,017
<i>and he pulled it so tight!</i>

723
01:08:03,051 --> 01:08:07,122
When it was all over,
Connie looked at me and I knew.

724
01:08:07,156 --> 01:08:09,825
I knew he would never hurt me.

725
01:08:09,859 --> 01:08:12,060
That he loved me.

726
01:08:12,094 --> 01:08:15,331
That's when you stopped
leaving the house, yeah?

727
01:08:17,099 --> 01:08:18,734
<i>And he built this room</i>

728
01:08:18,768 --> 01:08:22,136
<i>to punish fucking pedophiles
like your dad.</i>

729
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:26,275
Ah, I saw some twisted
fucking shit, but this...

730
01:08:26,309 --> 01:08:30,078
Pfft, you must be really proud
of yourself.

731
01:08:30,112 --> 01:08:32,480
No, I would've stopped,
but they didn't show me

732
01:08:32,514 --> 01:08:34,917
- they were sorry!
- <i>How would they do that?</i>

733
01:08:34,951 --> 01:08:38,020
Buy you flowers?

734
01:08:38,054 --> 01:08:41,489
Dear Anna,
so sorry to let you down.

735
01:08:41,523 --> 01:08:44,860
<i>- Yours truly, your stand-in dad.
- Stop.</i>

736
01:08:44,894 --> 01:08:47,863
<i>So pleased I got to join you
in your beautiful basement</i>

737
01:08:47,897 --> 01:08:50,031
<i>so we could help you erase
the feeling</i>

738
01:08:50,065 --> 01:08:51,800
<i>of Daddy between your legs.</i>

739
01:08:51,834 --> 01:08:54,302
- Stop...
- <i>Your brother was a sick fuck!</i>

740
01:08:54,336 --> 01:08:56,404
He got his rocks off
killing your dad,

741
01:08:56,438 --> 01:08:59,341
and he wanted to relive
the moment over and over again.

742
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:01,142
<i>- That's not true.
- Little crazy sister,</i>

743
01:09:01,176 --> 01:09:03,412
<i>little Anna, too scared
to leave, too dumb...</i>

744
01:09:03,446 --> 01:09:05,513
- No!
- <i>Shut the fuck up! Just stop!</i>

745
01:09:05,547 --> 01:09:07,348
Oh, I'm sorry, Dan.

746
01:09:07,382 --> 01:09:10,453
Sorry to mess with your girl.

747
01:09:28,938 --> 01:09:30,204
Dan.

748
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:32,039
Hmm...?

749
01:09:32,073 --> 01:09:34,411
Come to the mirror.

750
01:09:46,956 --> 01:09:48,791
What do you want?

751
01:09:48,825 --> 01:09:50,559
I want him to pay.

752
01:09:50,593 --> 01:09:52,561
<i>Oh...</i>

753
01:09:52,595 --> 01:09:55,897
<i>Okay, he's dead, Anna.</i>

754
01:09:55,931 --> 01:09:59,501
Okay?
He's been dead for a long time.

755
01:09:59,535 --> 01:10:01,436
No.

756
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:03,673
Him.

757
01:10:12,982 --> 01:10:14,348
Do it.

758
01:10:14,382 --> 01:10:17,586
Do what now?

759
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:19,288
<i>I'll let you go.</i>

760
01:10:19,322 --> 01:10:21,422
No.

761
01:10:21,456 --> 01:10:23,460
<i>Please?</i>

762
01:10:25,161 --> 01:10:26,528
I'm not like them.

763
01:10:26,562 --> 01:10:28,498
Just do it!

764
01:10:30,265 --> 01:10:32,534
Now dammit, Dan!

765
01:10:38,174 --> 01:10:39,842
<i>This is how?</i>

766
01:10:42,144 --> 01:10:45,480
This is how they show you
they're sorry?

767
01:10:45,514 --> 01:10:47,983
So much regret,

768
01:10:48,017 --> 01:10:50,284
so much remorse,

769
01:10:50,318 --> 01:10:52,287
that they just...

770
01:10:52,321 --> 01:10:55,289
bang.

771
01:10:55,323 --> 01:10:57,993
They were supposed
to take responsibility

772
01:10:58,027 --> 01:11:01,096
for what they did!
Just like you.

773
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:04,266
<i>Don't you feel sorry
for what you did?</i>

774
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:06,935
Big brothers are supposed to
protect their younger siblings,

775
01:11:06,969 --> 01:11:09,238
which is more than you did
for Vance.

776
01:11:09,272 --> 01:11:11,873
- <i>Stop talking about him.</i>
- You know it's your fault!

777
01:11:11,907 --> 01:11:14,543
- <i>Shut your mouth.</i>
- You knew he looked up to you.

778
01:11:14,577 --> 01:11:17,178
<i>You ever wonder if things
would've turned out differently</i>

779
01:11:17,212 --> 01:11:18,480
<i>if only...</i>

780
01:11:18,514 --> 01:11:20,414
I know
what you're trying to do.

781
01:11:20,448 --> 01:11:23,651
It doesn't change the truth.
I could let you go right now,

782
01:11:23,685 --> 01:11:27,657
<i>and there's nowhere you could go
to get away from what you did.</i>

783
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:43,539
I'm sorry!

784
01:11:45,707 --> 01:11:47,409
<i>Good.</i>

785
01:11:47,443 --> 01:11:50,212
That's good. Now... now show me.

786
01:11:57,553 --> 01:12:01,088
- Oh...
- <i>Show me you're sorry.</i>

787
01:12:01,122 --> 01:12:02,858
Show me.

788
01:12:14,103 --> 01:12:17,038
<i>You think I'm that weak?</i>

789
01:12:20,608 --> 01:12:23,345
I'd live a thousand years
with this on my shoulders

790
01:12:23,379 --> 01:12:25,414
before I pull this trigger.

791
01:12:27,416 --> 01:12:30,587
<i>You will... eventually.</i>

792
01:12:35,657 --> 01:12:37,726
One bullet for one man.

793
01:12:39,627 --> 01:12:41,898
No!

794
01:12:43,366 --> 01:12:47,002
What... what...
what are you doing?

795
01:12:47,036 --> 01:12:50,504
I found my way out.

796
01:12:50,538 --> 01:12:52,306
<i>You killed Vance,</i>

797
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:54,643
<i>- you killed Perry...
- Fuck.</i>

798
01:12:56,144 --> 01:12:59,213
<i>But you're still alive, Dan.</i>

799
01:12:59,247 --> 01:13:00,582
That doesn't mean anything!

800
01:13:00,616 --> 01:13:03,217
Ah, let's see.

801
01:13:06,688 --> 01:13:10,292
- <i>Argh...!</i>
- Mm! Please.

802
01:13:10,326 --> 01:13:12,627
No, no! Please stop!

803
01:13:12,661 --> 01:13:14,730
Please don't hurt him.

804
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,484
Fuck.

805
01:13:36,352 --> 01:13:37,819
Come on.

806
01:14:45,821 --> 01:14:49,025
Alright, brother, come on.

807
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:10,380
No.

808
01:15:34,636 --> 01:15:37,771
Fucking...
burn this house down.

809
01:15:37,805 --> 01:15:40,441
Burn his fucking memories.

810
01:15:40,475 --> 01:15:43,712
Burn his fucking
fucked-up family.

811
01:15:43,746 --> 01:15:46,614
Ah!

812
01:15:46,648 --> 01:15:48,917
...all fucking locked up.

813
01:15:48,951 --> 01:15:50,619
I let you go.

814
01:15:50,653 --> 01:15:53,187
Uh, yeah,
guess that was a mistake.

815
01:15:53,221 --> 01:15:54,788
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

816
01:15:54,822 --> 01:15:58,325
It was.
Now I just wanna see you burn.

817
01:16:07,603 --> 01:16:10,538
Argh!! Fuck!

818
01:16:10,572 --> 01:16:12,073
Fuck!

819
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:21,050
Bitch.

820
01:16:22,818 --> 01:16:24,686
Huh? C'mere.

821
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,954
C'mere. C'mon.

822
01:16:26,988 --> 01:16:28,789
Ah!!

823
01:16:28,823 --> 01:16:31,325
Ah!!! Ah!

824
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,294
I've got an idea.

825
01:16:33,328 --> 01:16:35,297
Ah! Ah!

826
01:16:35,331 --> 01:16:37,567
Ah! No!

827
01:16:41,737 --> 01:16:43,404
Don't!

828
01:16:43,438 --> 01:16:44,905
No!

829
01:16:44,939 --> 01:16:47,876
Don't! Ah!

830
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:49,945
Ah!!

831
01:16:51,846 --> 01:16:55,251
One last walk
down memory lane.

832
01:16:57,653 --> 01:17:03,592
Hold still! I'll give it to you
like Daddy did, just like Papa.

833
01:17:03,626 --> 01:17:07,529
Be a good little girl.
It'll be over soon.

834
01:17:07,563 --> 01:17:10,565
Hold still, Daddy's little girl.
Little angel.

835
01:17:10,599 --> 01:17:13,301
Yeah, that's it, just lie there,

836
01:17:13,335 --> 01:17:15,537
you broken little bitch.

837
01:17:15,571 --> 01:17:16,671
Hey! Stop!

838
01:17:16,705 --> 01:17:20,441
Ah! Stop, stop, stop, stop!

839
01:17:20,475 --> 01:17:22,545
Stop! Stop!

840
01:17:24,712 --> 01:17:27,916
This won't bring Vance back!

841
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:29,950
No more killing.

842
01:18:03,452 --> 01:18:05,588
I forgive you.
