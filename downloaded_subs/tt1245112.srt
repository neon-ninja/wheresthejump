1
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:39,884
Record it all, God damn it!

2
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:47,160
Rosso, record!

3
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:48,683
Okay!

4
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,077
Okay, let’s check.
Connect!

5
00:00:55,407 --> 00:00:57,523
From now on we record it all.

6
00:00:57,887 --> 00:01:00,196
Don’t disconnect
until we’re finished.

7
00:01:00,487 --> 00:01:03,399
-Finished what, chief?
-’Till I say so, okay?

8
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:07,037
-Anything else?
-No. We’re going in.

9
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:08,925
Fuckin’ great!

10
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:11,484
Rosso, let’s check.

11
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:12,602
Mini cameras in.

12
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:15,836
-Martos, in.
-Make me look handsome.

13
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:17,565
We’re working on that.

14
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:21,043
Now I’ve got you, Rosso!

15
00:01:25,207 --> 00:01:26,686
Chief, in.

16
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:30,040
-The signal is failing.
-As usual!

17
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:33,405
How much time have we got?

18
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:34,921
3 minutes.

19
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:38,126
Let’s check weapons...

20
00:01:39,687 --> 00:01:43,441
The area is sealed. The usual
protocol, inspect and recognition.

21
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:46,321
-We’ll get orders when we get there.
Orders from who?

22
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:50,116
From whoever gives orders.
Shit, let’s make it easy.

23
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:51,481
Easy? No shit!

24
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:55,638
We’ll have to use this.
Here.

25
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:56,557
Hell!

26
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:58,558
So the infection is for real?

27
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:00,922
-So it seems.
-Fuckin’ masks again!

28
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,645
-You too, Rosso.
-Shit!

29
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,676
How many times are you gonna check?

30
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:11,124
Okay, guys, get ready.

31
00:02:11,287 --> 00:02:14,563
Chief, can you turn the light off?
I’ll check the searchlight.

32
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:17,642
Larra, Argentinean and from
the Valencia soccer team.

33
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:20,082
I have been since “El Matador”.

34
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:21,600
Who is “El Matador”?

35
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:26,242
You don’t know? I won’t stand up
‘cause I don’t fit.

36
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:28,125
Maria Alberto Kempes!

37
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:29,925
-We got backup lights?
-Assault, three.

38
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:31,998
You’re from Granada and for the Barca.

39
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:36,001
Yes, but don’t compare.
Rivaldo, Romario, Koeman,

40
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:37,998
-Kily, Pirjo...
-That’s enough!

41
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:44,356
We’re arriving.
There seems to be action.

42
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:46,436
...fuckin’ great...

43
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:50,795
Take it all.
Battering rams, flares. Everything.

44
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:53,242
Sir, who carries the battering ram?

45
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,126
-I will. Fuck you!
-come on, guys!

46
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,720
I only asked...

47
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:00,355
Enough! Okay, let’s go, go, go...!

48
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:09,640
Attention, attention,
leave the perimeter!

49
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:15,637
Sir!

50
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:18,640
This is the situation.

51
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:21,082
We know there is
a contagious infection.

52
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:22,885
We’ve quarantined the building.

53
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:25,003
A technician from
the Ministry is going in

54
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:27,886
to see if he can find out
what’s going on.

55
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:29,765
Your mission is to escort him.

56
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:32,487
-This is Dr....
Owen, Ministry of Health.

57
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:35,081
A pleasure.
No one’s gone in or out?

58
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:38,125
2 hrs. ago a Ministry Dr.
went in to

59
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:42,280
try and control this,
but we lost contact 70 minutes ago.

60
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:46,439
The people infected seem
to show a certain type of

61
00:03:47,807 --> 00:03:48,523
aggressiveness.

62
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,598
The symptoms are similar to rabies.

63
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:53,679
We have at least
two deceased inside,

64
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:55,075
and one is a cop.

65
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:00,885
-Hold it, hold it!
-You’re going in?

66
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:03,925
You’re going in?
I need to go in with you.

67
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:06,555
My wife and daughter
are in there.

68
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:08,001
Get him out of here!

69
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,681
They have a fever.
I went to the drug store...

70
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:12,565
Rosso, we’re going in.

71
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:15,200
-Thanks,
-Let’s go!

72
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:16,402
Be careful in there.

73
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:21,237
You know, guys!
Fast and easy!

74
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:24,001
-Fast and easy, sir.
-Fast and easy!

75
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:28,403
-We need an authorization.
-Authorization granted.

76
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:29,963
Rosso!

77
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:32,277
Let’s go!

78
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:36,679
Main door locked.

79
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:48,677
Don’t touch it!

80
00:04:57,527 --> 00:04:58,846
What the fuck...?

81
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:02,247
The virus is not in the air,

82
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:05,365
just in fluids, blood and saliva.

83
00:05:05,527 --> 00:05:08,280
You can take it off,
there’s no danger.

84
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:11,280
-So why’d they force us to...
-Pure show.

85
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:13,278
We must keep this confidential.

86
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,085
What do we do, chief?

87
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:18,361
Out!
-Are you sure?

88
00:05:20,327 --> 00:05:22,841
-We’ll start upstairs.
-Let’s go!

89
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:30,119
We must reach the penthouse.

90
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,562
We think the infection
started there.

91
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:34,483
All clear!

92
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:41,004
This is too calm.

93
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:53,076
Let’s keep going.

94
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:06,037
Chief, chief, doctor.

95
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,485
Doctor, upstairs.

96
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:15,446
Make way.

97
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:19,316
Go on.

98
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:24,602
-And you?
-I need to get a sample.

99
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,519
-We should have controlled downstairs.
-There’s no time.

100
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:51,122
Let’s go.

101
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:04,597
Hold it!

102
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:07,363
Rosso, cover me.

103
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:12,640
Stop, stop!

104
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:17,924
It’s here.
We must go over it.

105
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,516
Be careful!

106
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:22,157
Battering ram!

107
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:28,877
Ready.

108
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,877
Larra, light!

109
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:51,963
-Control the door, Martos.
Okay.

110
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:57,284
We have to secure this place

111
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:59,483
but above all, don’t touch anything.

112
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,444
If in doubt, let me know.

113
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:04,847
Martos, how’s that going?

114
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:06,360
Done.

115
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,803
Okay, you’ve heard.
Let’s get to work.

116
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:12,882
-Rosso, you stay there.
Okay.

117
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:14,639
Whatever he says.

118
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:18,525
You know how it works,

119
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:22,200
extensive documentation,
so record everything.

120
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,678
What are we looking for, exactly?

121
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:41,758
You just record.

122
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:00,885
Give me some light here.

123
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:04,040
It’s still hot.

124
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:10,400
The enzyme has proven
to be extremely contagious.

125
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:13,121
They’re very nervous in Rome.

126
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,517
Carboni called this morning.

127
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,518
He ordered me to stop it all.

128
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:19,917
But the insect bites worry me.

129
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:21,640
I think they are mosquitoes.

130
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:24,162
Record the walls, everything...

131
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:28,161
They are afraid it’s too late.
Dear God, I’m your humble servant...

132
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:37,239
There’s something here!

133
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,957
Let’s go!

134
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:44,600
Martos, check it out.

135
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:47,801
Be careful.

136
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:03,276
Up we go!

137
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:11,840
Rosso, tap in.

138
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,357
In.

139
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:25,597
Report.

140
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,166
Looks like a junk room.

141
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:41,204
Nothing, just shit.
Clear.

142
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:44,161
What was that?

143
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:47,282
It seems as if
we’re not alone.

144
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:50,117
So it seems.
Let’s go check it out.

145
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:53,438
No! Our priority is
to examine this place.

146
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:56,405
Yes, and see if there are
any survivors.

147
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:59,843
I remind you that
I give the orders here.

148
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:02,123
come on, come on!

149
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:04,963
Martos!

150
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:06,795
Go, Martos!

151
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:18,402
Go, go!

152
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:36,205
You are making a mistake.

153
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:40,600
What is that?

154
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:41,603
Martos.

155
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,322
Larra, cover.

156
00:11:55,487 --> 00:11:57,842
Rosso... cut in.

157
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:01,683
In!

158
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:12,241
Martos, report.

159
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:16,882
It comes from here.
The door is open.

160
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:19,277
I’m going in.

161
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:21,406
Okay, but be careful.

162
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:26,964
It seems all clear.

163
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:28,355
Okay, go on.

164
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:48,122
It’s here.

165
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:50,363
Be careful.

166
00:12:57,847 --> 00:13:00,236
Martos, Martos!

167
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:06,637
Someone seems to have had a party.

168
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:10,920
Okay, come back here.

169
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:20,955
What is it, Martos?

170
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:34,163
What is that?
What’s going on there?

171
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,760
Hang on, Martos!

172
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:47,365
Hang on, Martos!
We’re coming!

173
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,004
-Where?
-It’s over there!

174
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:53,115
Martos!

175
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:55,801
What happened,
where is that thing?

176
00:13:57,487 --> 00:13:59,318
-Careful!
-Martos, no!

177
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:02,638
Martos, take it easy!
It’s us!

178
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:04,320
Martos, take it easy!

179
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:10,678
-Get it off me!
-Fuck, Martos!

180
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:13,361
Martos, what the fuck are you doing?

181
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,316
Get it off, Larra.

182
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:27,363
Holy father!

183
00:14:27,527 --> 00:14:29,916
Look at this servant of yours, and

184
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:31,918
send your Spirit to him.

185
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:34,806
Christ’s blood breaks all bonds,

186
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:37,162
all influence on this body.

187
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:40,876
In the sign of the cross,
free us of our enemies, Our Lord.

188
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:43,880
By your cross, save us.

189
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:45,366
What shit is this?

190
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:50,399
Larra, fuckin’ help me!

191
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:51,717
What should I do?

192
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:55,357
You record. Keep on recording.
Make way!

193
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:57,884
-Shit!
-I can’t take this!

194
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,366
I just can’t!

195
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:11,924
Why’d he stop now?

196
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:14,726
What did he do?
What shit is this?

197
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:17,765
We have to go back
to the penthouse.

198
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:20,316
We must get the fuck out of here!

199
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:24,960
That man was okay 5 minutes ago!
What sort of a virus does this?

200
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:29,280
I recommend you limit yourselves
to carrying out your orders.

201
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:31,885
You recommend...!

202
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:35,198
The way things are now,
we can’t guarantee your safety,

203
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,439
nor ours either.
This is way too big.

204
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:40,802
I remind you that no one is leaving

205
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:43,242
until I give the order, and

206
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:46,126
you know how it works,
voice recognition.

207
00:15:46,287 --> 00:15:48,164
Now you listen to me!

208
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:51,956
I’ve just lost, or whatever,
one of my men.

209
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:55,119
So start telling us all you know

210
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,403
because clearly you know more than me.

211
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:00,798
Chief, relax.

212
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:08,645
Okay, okay, but let’s go upstairs,

213
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:10,206
we’re not safe here.

214
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:14,481
Let’s go, let’s go!

215
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:23,921
Larra, the door.

216
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:26,157
Okay.

217
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:30,597
Now you tell me what the fuck
happened down there.

218
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,883
It’s not just a simple virus.

219
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:39,003
We just fuckin’ saw that!

220
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,876
This is Tristana Medeiros.

221
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:50,761
At 11 she began giving signs
of being possessed.

222
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:55,598
The Vatican checked it and
the case was accepted.

223
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,598
Possessed by what?

224
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:00,118
A diabolic possession.

225
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:05,559
Father Albelda took charge
of the girl.

226
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:09,962
It was a perfect chance to study
the physiological symptoms

227
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:12,277
of a diabolic possession.

228
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:16,637
If we could isolate
the chemical essence, we could

229
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:18,365
find an antidote.

230
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:21,601
What the fuck’s he saying, chief?

231
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:23,280
What the fuck are you saying?

232
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:25,957
It all had to be very discreet

233
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:28,197
that’s why they chose this place.

234
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:30,517
I can’t believe this.

235
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,444
You can’t be serious.

236
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:36,758
We seemed to have
achieved it, but

237
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:38,997
something must have gone wrong.

238
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,203
This is fuckin’ shit!

239
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:43,961
This guy’s pulling our fuckin’ leg!

240
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:46,402
Who the fuck are you?

241
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:50,320
We were told you were from
the Ministry of Health.

242
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,719
Don’t be a fool.

243
00:17:54,927 --> 00:17:57,043
Answer! Who the fuck sent you?

244
00:17:57,207 --> 00:17:59,960
It has nothing to do with them.

245
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:03,524
They don’t know
what’s really going on.

246
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:05,917
They’re not in charge here.

247
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:13,917
What a fuckin’ joke!
Chief, the guy is a priest.

248
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:16,919
A priest, chief.

249
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:18,964
-Sons of a bitch!
-They tricked us!

250
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:21,766
This is a secret operation.

251
00:18:22,487 --> 00:18:25,763
No one should know.
You either.

252
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:28,477
What are you going to do?
What?

253
00:18:28,647 --> 00:18:31,002
Kill us after we’re finished?

254
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:33,237
What are you going to do,
you son of a bitch?

255
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:36,160
Be sure no one will believe you.

256
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:38,761
You’re right!
You’re right!

257
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:41,441
What will we say,
the building is infested with what?

258
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:43,245
Possessed people.

259
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,361
Demons.

260
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:56,202
Chief!

261
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,558
Shit... Shit!

262
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:03,717
Hey,

263
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,638
I don’t care what happened here.

264
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:09,877
I’ve just lost a man

265
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:15,004
and all I want is to get
out of this fuckin’ hell now!

266
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:17,803
So...

267
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:20,563
tell me what we must do...

268
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:23,083
and let’s get this the fuck over!

269
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:25,563
As per reports,

270
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:28,958
there should be a blood sample
of the girl,

271
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,881
the original blood,
that’s what we want.

272
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,244
We need it to find
the antidote.

273
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,804
Let’s finish searching here.

274
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,765
There was a door at the back.
come on, Larra!

275
00:19:47,527 --> 00:19:49,597
come on, come on, come on!

276
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:51,519
I’m coming, I’m coming.

277
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,516
come on, Rosso!

278
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:02,403
It’s there!

279
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:04,398
Yes... it has to be here.

280
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:30,116
come on, come on.

281
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:32,437
Doctor...

282
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,440
This has no way out.

283
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:46,441
-This doesn’t make sense.
-There’s nothing here.

284
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:51,600
What shit is this?

285
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,723
Get back, get back!

286
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,718
What shit is this?

287
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:59,324
These are your experiments?
What is this?

288
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:00,522
Relax!

289
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:04,077
Relax? These are children!
They’re children!

290
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:05,637
Fuck!

291
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,719
Where the fuck did they
send us, chief?

292
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:09,683
Relax.

293
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:11,246
I’m relaxed, chief.

294
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:14,001
Larra! Larra!
Relax, okay?

295
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:19,201
What is this?
What is this?

296
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:21,642
Relax, Larra!
Fuckin’ relax!

297
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:26,085
Relax. Relax, okay?

298
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:29,678
Okay, it’s over. There’s nothing here.

299
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:31,405
No! We must go on!

300
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,956
That blood must be somewhere.
I don’t get it.

301
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,083
-Nothing here!
-It has to be.

302
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:37,677
Chief!

303
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:41,563
Chief!

304
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:43,924
-Shoot!
-Get it off. Get it off me!

305
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:45,315
Don’t move...

306
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:47,682
Careful!

307
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:53,115
-Chief, what was that?
-I don’t fuckin’ know!

308
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:56,484
Relax, everyone take it easy!

309
00:21:56,647 --> 00:21:57,557
Let’s go...

310
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,082
The ceiling, the ceiling!

311
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:06,920
Where has it gone?

312
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:08,756
Chief, chief!

313
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:19,123
Get away!

314
00:22:30,927 --> 00:22:31,677
Be careful!

315
00:22:33,247 --> 00:22:34,680
Don’t come closer. Back!

316
00:22:36,207 --> 00:22:38,675
Back, back, Rosso, back.

317
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:43,165
-Shit!
-Freeze!

318
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:46,437
Don’t come closer.

319
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:48,883
The ceiling, watch the ceiling.

320
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:52,237
Turn it around, carefully.

321
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:56,398
Okay, get back.

322
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:59,280
Who the fuck is he?

323
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:02,761
Albelda, no doubt.

324
00:23:02,927 --> 00:23:05,566
Chief, there’s something here.

325
00:23:05,727 --> 00:23:07,365
I think it’s a duct.

326
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,925
A duct, of course.

327
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:13,279
Bravo, Albelda, very smart!

328
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:16,837
That blood must be up there.
We must...

329
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:20,283
Get it off!

330
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:22,881
Get it off me!

331
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:28,121
Okay, shoot, aim at his head.
Aim at his head!

332
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,125
Shoot it, shoot it!

333
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:38,885
Okay. Shoot at the head!

334
00:23:39,047 --> 00:23:41,481
-It’s under control.
-It’s just a child!

335
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,359
-Just a child!
-No!

336
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:45,637
No, it’s not.

337
00:24:11,407 --> 00:24:12,317
Rosso...

338
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,318
Larra, check the ceiling.

339
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:22,441
It’ll hold up.

340
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:28,602
Doctor!

341
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:31,996
Take good hold.

342
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:39,285
-Be careful!
-Shit!

343
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,602
Be careful!

344
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:48,564
-What do you see?
-Just a moment.

345
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:54,006
Rosso, cut in!

346
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:54,758
In.

347
00:25:10,847 --> 00:25:12,803
Larra, be very careful.

348
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:14,723
Don’t worry.

349
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:20,317
Shit...

350
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:22,121
See anything?

351
00:25:25,647 --> 00:25:26,841
There’s something here.

352
00:25:27,007 --> 00:25:27,917
What is it?

353
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:31,080
It’s like a freezer.
And it seems to work.

354
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:39,483
The test tube! Get it!

355
00:25:43,927 --> 00:25:46,487
-It’s got a label.
-What’s it say?

356
00:25:46,647 --> 00:25:49,241
C28, M03, T. Medeiros.

357
00:25:49,407 --> 00:25:52,444
We’ve got it.
Now bring it here.

358
00:25:57,527 --> 00:25:59,279
-What’s going on?
-I don’t know.

359
00:25:59,807 --> 00:26:01,604
-What’s going on?
-I don’t know.

360
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:02,756
What is this?

361
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:07,522
come on, get out of there,
Larra, get out!

362
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:19,645
Come on, Larra, out you go!

363
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:25,557
Are you okay?

364
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:26,762
Fuckin’ great.

365
00:26:26,927 --> 00:26:28,201
Now give it to me.

366
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:35,726
You have her blood.
Now let us out of here.

367
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:39,323
No, not until we’re sure.
I must check it.

368
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:43,164
But check what, fuck?
It’s quite clear there.

369
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:45,318
Medeiros. What more do you need?

370
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:48,524
That makes no difference.
I told you, I must check it.

371
00:26:49,727 --> 00:26:52,082
You already have, Medeiros!
Doctor!

372
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:57,684
My omnipotent God, see my
distress and come in my aid,

373
00:26:57,847 --> 00:27:01,556
Jesus, image of the Father,
splendor of the eternal light.

374
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,718
Hold this. Very carefully.

375
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:09,280
What the fuck’s he saying?

376
00:27:09,447 --> 00:27:10,197
...comfort for the abandoned,

377
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:13,325
you who came into this world
so compassionate of me,

378
00:27:13,487 --> 00:27:15,637
who went down to the hells,

379
00:27:15,807 --> 00:27:17,923
who resurrected amongst the dead,

380
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:21,238
free us from our enemies,
have compassion of us.

381
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,359
It has reacted, we’ve got it.

382
00:27:26,327 --> 00:27:27,282
Hell!

383
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,965
I’m sorry. It was burning.

384
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:35,957
What now?

385
00:27:36,127 --> 00:27:39,403
That was the only one we had!
Fuck!

386
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:45,041
-Voice recognition requested.
Owen.

387
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:48,440
-Recognition confirmed.
-Go ahead.

388
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,400
We have seen civilians at a window.
What do we do?

389
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:53,602
No one is to leave.

390
00:27:53,767 --> 00:27:56,964
I repeat, no one is to go
outside until I give the order.

391
00:27:57,127 --> 00:27:58,162
Roger!

392
00:27:58,327 --> 00:27:59,646
What now?

393
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:07,798
-Keep on looking.
Oh, come on.

394
00:28:10,207 --> 00:28:12,277
-Larra, the door!
-Yes, chief.

395
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:16,401
No one’s out of here until
we finish the mission.

396
00:28:17,527 --> 00:28:20,678
That’s clear.
What’s not so clear is...

397
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:21,757
Watch it!

398
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:27,956
Stay clear!

399
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:33,396
Get back, Larra!

400
00:28:40,247 --> 00:28:42,044
Hey, who the fuck are you?

401
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:45,361
-How did they get in?
-They’ve got a camera.

402
00:28:45,887 --> 00:28:46,797
Catch them!

403
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:49,324
Catch them? What for?

404
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:51,757
They’re not going anywhere,
you said so.

405
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:53,645
You know what
a secret operation is.

406
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:56,275
No cameras can be around.

407
00:28:57,007 --> 00:28:58,440
That’s an order!

408
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:02,205
-come on, come on!
-God damn it!

409
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:05,445
Hold it! Freeze!

410
00:29:06,487 --> 00:29:07,397
Move it, fast!

411
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:15,635
Let’s go!

412
00:29:17,887 --> 00:29:21,118
-Where the fuck did they go?
-I don’t know. Move, move!

413
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:31,117
Larra, check.

414
00:29:38,127 --> 00:29:39,116
Larra, report.

415
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:43,320
All clear.
It seems they’re not here.

416
00:29:43,487 --> 00:29:45,557
In any case,
they’re not getting out.

417
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:47,320
All clear.

418
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:48,883
Make sure.

419
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:54,077
-What is this?
-I said in the head!

420
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:56,805
-Shit!
-Larra.

421
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:57,797
Fast!

422
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:02,159
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

423
00:30:02,687 --> 00:30:04,917
Fast, fast, move it!

424
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:06,556
Here, use it!

425
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:36,642
Over here, the door!
It’s open.

426
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:44,922
This will hold.

427
00:30:45,127 --> 00:30:46,685
What are they doing?

428
00:30:47,327 --> 00:30:48,362
Leaving.

429
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:53,556
-Larra, Larra... fuck!
-Cut in Rosso.

430
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:54,318
-In.
-Shit!

431
00:30:58,727 --> 00:31:02,197
Larra... Larra... Situation.
Larra!

432
00:31:05,927 --> 00:31:07,201
I’m in front, chief.

433
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:10,997
Stay there.
We’ll get you out.

434
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:15,163
Hold on. As soon as it’s all clear,
we’ll go get you.

435
00:31:21,687 --> 00:31:22,881
-Ma’am, hold it.
-Shoot.

436
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,002
-Hold it.
-Shoot.

437
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:30,685
Okay, okay, okay...

438
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:35,804
Larra, get back!
come on, do it!

439
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:43,602
Take cover. Take cover.

440
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:47,636
The clip, chief!
I’m out of fuckin’ ammo!

441
00:31:53,487 --> 00:31:54,556
Take cover, quick!

442
00:32:01,927 --> 00:32:03,360
The window, the window.

443
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:09,761
Shit!

444
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:13,444
Okay, okay.
Keep cool.

445
00:32:13,607 --> 00:32:16,724
The gun.
Listen, the pistol.

446
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:19,959
You still have ammo.
You can do it, Larra.

447
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:23,162
You can do it...

448
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:30,201
Larra, what are you doing?

449
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:32,481
Larra... Larra!

450
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:35,395
Larra!

451
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:44,956
Chief...

452
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:51,315
We’re getting out.

453
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:55,285
Give the fuckin’ order.

454
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:00,800
We’re getting out!

455
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:04,359
Incorrect voice recognition.

456
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:08,916
We’re not finished,

457
00:33:10,327 --> 00:33:12,283
we need the blood.

458
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:15,405
There was just one sample,
you said so.

459
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:19,324
Now it’s lost.
It’s all over.

460
00:33:19,487 --> 00:33:21,159
We can get a new sample.

461
00:33:21,327 --> 00:33:22,885
That’s bull shit.

462
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:25,681
You said it had to be
the original blood.

463
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:29,681
The girl Medeiros
began the contagion.

464
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:33,880
The evil resides within her.

465
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:37,159
We must find her and
take a sample.

466
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:38,806
It’s the only way.

467
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:40,923
We don’t even know
if she’s still alive.

468
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:43,362
Enough!

469
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:45,043
We’re leaving.

470
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:53,442
Do you have kids?

471
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:56,920
What about you?

472
00:33:57,607 --> 00:33:58,403
What?

473
00:34:00,807 --> 00:34:03,480
Would you shoot them
in the head given the case?

474
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,277
If this virus got out of here

475
00:34:10,807 --> 00:34:13,924
we had better have an antidote.

476
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:21,757
Chief...

477
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:24,762
Don’t move.

478
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:34,722
Don’t touch it.

479
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:37,243
A woman.

480
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:39,957
She’s dead.

481
00:34:43,607 --> 00:34:46,041
-What is this?
-A rocket.

482
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:47,436
A rocket?

483
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:48,835
What the hell...?

484
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,476
Chief, I’m receiving
a signal from Martos.

485
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:53,638
What? Cut in.

486
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:57,035
Cut in, Rosso.

487
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:06,199
Now we know where they are.

488
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:09,122
Watch out!

489
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:16,677
Get her off me!
Get her off!

490
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:36,165
The camera, get the camera!

491
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:40,318
I’ve got her, I’ve got her!

492
00:35:42,087 --> 00:35:43,042
I know you.

493
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,005
Shut up! In the name of Christ,
where are you?

494
00:35:47,847 --> 00:35:50,077
Record it all. That’s fundamental.

495
00:35:51,087 --> 00:35:53,282
She knows you?
What the fuck’s going on?

496
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:56,962
They are her puppets.
She talks through them.

497
00:35:57,127 --> 00:35:59,800
Who’s she?

498
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:02,481
The girl, Medeiros. The evil.

499
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:04,964
Where are you?

500
00:36:05,127 --> 00:36:06,799
You never give up, father.

501
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:08,161
God protects me.

502
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:10,960
Help me, I can’t hold her back.

503
00:36:13,727 --> 00:36:14,603
Here you are!

504
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:20,639
Get her!

505
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,197
In the name of God,
where are you hiding?

506
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:25,846
Search, priest, search!

507
00:36:26,647 --> 00:36:28,763
She’s getting away, Rosso.
Help me!

508
00:36:28,927 --> 00:36:32,442
No, wait, we need her.
For the last time, where are you?

509
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:35,685
Our God orders you: Tell me

510
00:36:35,847 --> 00:36:37,360
where you are?

511
00:36:37,527 --> 00:36:38,755
What should I do?

512
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:43,966
Rosso, fuck!

513
00:36:51,327 --> 00:36:53,682
Hold her tight!

514
00:36:58,127 --> 00:37:01,676
What have you done?
I could have made her talk.

515
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:05,997
We almost had it.
It was our last chance.

516
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:12,443
No, there’s still a chance.

517
00:37:17,287 --> 00:37:19,960
-Martos.
-Shit!

518
00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:22,118
What’s going on?

519
00:37:22,287 --> 00:37:25,518
I don’t know.
The lenses are broken.

520
00:37:25,687 --> 00:37:26,961
It’s shifted.

521
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:45,605
Use your lighter.

522
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:51,560
-I’m not sure.
-Where should we put it?

523
00:37:52,207 --> 00:37:54,880
-Here, here.
-What the fuck am I doing here?

524
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:57,038
-It won’t fall?
-No, grab it over here.

525
00:37:57,207 --> 00:37:59,516
I’ll give it some more,
just in case.

526
00:37:59,687 --> 00:38:01,484
-How many now?
-Three.

527
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:03,956
Only?
-That’s what we said.

528
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:05,879
Will this last long?

529
00:38:06,647 --> 00:38:08,399
Don’t you worry. Just record.

530
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:10,478
But, will it fly with three?

531
00:38:10,647 --> 00:38:13,366
Well, it cost me 20 Euros which,

532
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:16,485
by the way,
we were to split between three.

533
00:38:16,647 --> 00:38:17,238
Yeah!

534
00:38:17,407 --> 00:38:19,363
Did we say that, or didn’t we?

535
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:20,437
Bull shit!

536
00:38:20,607 --> 00:38:23,041
-Shit, didn’t we?
-Sure, man.

537
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:24,959
She’s an asshole!

538
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:26,845
come on, she’s your sister.

539
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:29,965
-Sure, you like her.
-What, asshole?

540
00:38:31,607 --> 00:38:34,041
-What a pain.
-Where do we put it?

541
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:36,880
-Here.
-I don’t know why the fuck I’m here.

542
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:38,878
-You sure it won’t fall?
-Yeah, grab this.

543
00:38:39,047 --> 00:38:40,366
Mire, come over here.

544
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:43,041
It’s going to fly and
you must follow it.

545
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:44,435
Sure, we’ll see.

546
00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:47,565
Fuckin’ shit!
You record, I don’t trust her.

547
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:49,640
Yeah, you record and don’t get...

548
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,196
come on, come on...

549
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:54,880
One, two, three.

550
00:38:55,887 --> 00:38:57,479
come on, guys!

551
00:38:58,687 --> 00:38:59,642
come on!

552
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:05,962
Up and away!

553
00:39:07,007 --> 00:39:09,475
Come on, cutie, let’s fly!

554
00:39:15,407 --> 00:39:17,045
What shit!

555
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:19,084
You were taken for 20 Euros.

556
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:21,807
-Oh, shit.
-What the fuck is this?

557
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,122
What a couple of assholes, guys!

558
00:39:25,807 --> 00:39:27,479
Shit, what is this?

559
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:28,483
Fuck.

560
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:32,961
What the fuck are you doing here?

561
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:33,764
Nothing!

562
00:39:33,927 --> 00:39:35,997
We are evacuating the building.

563
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:38,681
-Why?
-Move it, now!

564
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:45,678
What is this?

565
00:39:53,847 --> 00:39:55,246
Incredible, man!

566
00:39:55,407 --> 00:39:57,477
It’s covered with plastic.

567
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:01,562
Let me see.

568
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,759
Fuck, and those?

569
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:08,761
-I don’t know but they’re like SWAT.
-SWAT?

570
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:10,920
What are they going to do?

571
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:15,118
I don’t know, but something
big is going down there.

572
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:16,762
If not, why...?

573
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,078
Uri, Uri. Look at that guy.

574
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:24,321
You’re recording, right?

575
00:40:24,487 --> 00:40:26,125
He’s out of it, man.

576
00:40:26,407 --> 00:40:27,806
What?

577
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,686
-Follow him.
-Shut the fuck up!

578
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:35,121
-come on Uri, follow them.
-Hey, you can’t be here, guys.

579
00:40:35,287 --> 00:40:38,438
Uri, come on, fast.
-I’m coming, fuckin’ hell!

580
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,838
-What?
-He’s there, man, over there.

581
00:40:43,727 --> 00:40:44,682
What’s he doing?

582
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:47,566
Look, he’s with a fireman.
They’re up to something.

583
00:40:48,967 --> 00:40:49,717
Tito!

584
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,080
We’ve got coverage.

585
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:54,602
I spoke with mama.
She said to go to auntie’s place.

586
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:57,281
-You’ll go to auntie’s place.
-Idiot!

587
00:40:57,967 --> 00:41:00,925
-Look! What are you doing?
-They’re coming, man.

588
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:07,476
I told you!

589
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:09,126
I’m sure they’re coming in.

590
00:41:09,807 --> 00:41:11,206
Let’s go!

591
00:41:12,007 --> 00:41:14,202
-Fuck, let’s go!
-Go, go, go...

592
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:17,765
-Tito, you’ll get into a mess.
-come on, man!

593
00:41:17,927 --> 00:41:18,882
Wait, Mire!

594
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:22,046
Fuckin’ wait.

595
00:41:23,087 --> 00:41:25,157
-Run, run, run!
-Holy shit!

596
00:41:26,607 --> 00:41:28,438
You’ll get into a mess, Tito.

597
00:41:28,727 --> 00:41:30,080
-It’s here!
-You sure?

598
00:41:30,247 --> 00:41:31,965
If not, why would it be open?

599
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:34,197
-What do we do?
-Fuck, go in, right?

600
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:37,122
-Don’t fuck around, man.
-Well, okay...

601
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,243
-come on, help me.
-Mire, hold it, please.

602
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:40,806
No, I’m not going in.

603
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:43,845
-Sure you are!
-No, I’m not going in.

604
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:45,406
Fuck, Mire, please...

605
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:48,365
This is our chance.
We go in, and that’s it.

606
00:41:48,527 --> 00:41:49,198
Sure...

607
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:51,198
maybe we’ll make some money.

608
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:54,040
You’re out of it!
Can’t you see what’s going on?

609
00:41:54,207 --> 00:41:56,767
-You’re like kids.
-Then why the fuck did we come here?

610
00:41:56,927 --> 00:41:58,565
You guys came.
Don’t involve me.

611
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:00,524
I’m sick of your stupidities.

612
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,405
First with the doll,
and now this.

613
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:04,956
-Okay, don’t blow my mind!
-Fuckin’ relax, guys!

614
00:42:05,127 --> 00:42:08,244
She’s always fuckin’ us.
For once we can do something cool...

615
00:42:08,407 --> 00:42:09,442
You know what?

616
00:42:09,607 --> 00:42:11,484
The camera is mine
and I’m out of here.

617
00:42:11,647 --> 00:42:13,558
Fuck, Tito! Fuck, Tito!
Fuck, man!

618
00:42:13,727 --> 00:42:15,285
She’s so dumb.

619
00:42:15,447 --> 00:42:16,766
Then let her go.

620
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:18,997
What’s this all about?
You always mess things up.

621
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,158
-Don’t mess up, Mire.
-Fuck, Mire.

622
00:42:21,327 --> 00:42:22,442
Mire...!

623
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,962
-Do it for me.
-This girl is dumb.

624
00:42:25,247 --> 00:42:27,363
Go to hell, you nerd!

625
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:31,236
-Mire, please!
-I said no...!

626
00:42:33,807 --> 00:42:35,365
-Fuck!
-What’s up?

627
00:42:35,527 --> 00:42:37,324
I don’t know,
I can’t see a shit.

628
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:40,240
How weird because this is full of it.

629
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:42,682
We’ll get sick here.

630
00:42:42,847 --> 00:42:44,758
Fuck, I thought it would be worse.

631
00:42:44,927 --> 00:42:46,838
Worse? I’m about to throw up.

632
00:42:47,007 --> 00:42:48,565
This is your street, isn’t it?

633
00:42:48,727 --> 00:42:51,161
-Some of your shit must be here.
-You’re such a pig!

634
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:52,555
You don’t shit, or what?

635
00:42:52,727 --> 00:42:54,683
Sure I do,
but this isn’t my street!

636
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,315
-Dogs?
-Uri, hold the camera.

637
00:42:58,287 --> 00:42:59,242
Okay, okay.
-Got it?

638
00:42:59,527 --> 00:43:02,246
-Tito, this isn’t cool, let’s go.
-What the fuck is this?

639
00:43:03,767 --> 00:43:05,803
-The cops!
-Fuck!

640
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:06,717
Run, run, run...

641
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:09,162
Shut up!
They’ll hear you.

642
00:43:09,327 --> 00:43:11,443
We’re fucking this up!

643
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:13,122
They are coming!

644
00:43:15,487 --> 00:43:16,806
What are you doing?

645
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:19,040
-This way.
-come on!

646
00:43:19,207 --> 00:43:20,765
Make it fuckin’ fast.
This way!

647
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:22,764
We’re gonna flow it, man.

648
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:23,643
Shut up!

649
00:43:25,287 --> 00:43:28,359
-They got in this way.
-You’re crazy!

650
00:43:31,647 --> 00:43:33,285
We’re overdoing it.

651
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:36,325
Mire, we can’t go back.
They’ve seen us.

652
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:38,757
Go on, move.

653
00:43:41,767 --> 00:43:43,758
Where are we?

654
00:43:45,487 --> 00:43:46,761
Shit!

655
00:43:52,767 --> 00:43:54,883
Okay, we’re in, now let’s get out.

656
00:43:55,047 --> 00:43:57,197
Fuckin’ wait.
You’re a pain in the ass!

657
00:43:57,967 --> 00:44:00,117
Hell, Tito.
Have a look, man.

658
00:44:00,447 --> 00:44:02,438
-Uri, drop that!
-Shit!

659
00:44:02,847 --> 00:44:05,520
Cool. Is it real?

660
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:07,917
-It weighs a lot.
-Tito, please, drop that.

661
00:44:08,807 --> 00:44:10,081
Fuck...

662
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:13,802
I told you, we’re gonna get caught.

663
00:44:14,287 --> 00:44:17,245
You see, it’s them.
The fireman and the freak.

664
00:44:20,447 --> 00:44:21,482
See anything?

665
00:44:24,967 --> 00:44:26,480
-Holy shit!
-It just went off.

666
00:44:27,927 --> 00:44:28,564
Shit!

667
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,206
-We’ve done nothing!
-How’d you get in?

668
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:34,244
That way, just like you.

669
00:44:34,407 --> 00:44:36,045
What’s going on here?

670
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:37,959
This is dangerous,
you can’t stay here.

671
00:44:38,127 --> 00:44:39,242
What about you?

672
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:40,283
come on, let’s go.

673
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:43,086
Fuck, wait, wait!
What are you doing with the camera?

674
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:45,321
-Holy shit!
-I’m sorry!

675
00:44:45,487 --> 00:44:48,240
Where the fuck did you get that?

676
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:49,965
It was there, on the floor.

677
00:44:50,127 --> 00:44:52,641
It looks official,
police issue.

678
00:44:52,807 --> 00:44:55,367
Must be from the first who came in.

679
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:57,961
Get out of here, fast!

680
00:44:58,127 --> 00:44:59,606
Why is that?

681
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:01,997
There’s an infection in the air!

682
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:04,920
And so you don’t wear masks.
You think we’re dumb?

683
00:45:05,087 --> 00:45:07,123
-They are of no use.
-Shut the fuck up!

684
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,003
But it’s true.

685
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:11,079
Just shut the fuck up.
And you guys, out.

686
00:45:11,247 --> 00:45:13,203
-Tito, let’s go.
-No, Mire, no.

687
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:15,517
-Fuck, I’m out of here.
-come on, Tito!

688
00:45:15,687 --> 00:45:17,279
Didn’t you hear?

689
00:45:17,727 --> 00:45:19,319
If not, will you shoot me?

690
00:45:26,087 --> 00:45:28,521
Tito, Tito!
Uri, hold it, please.

691
00:45:29,767 --> 00:45:32,327
-Tito, please.
-Leave me alone.

692
00:45:32,607 --> 00:45:33,926
come on, Tito.

693
00:45:34,087 --> 00:45:34,837
Tito!

694
00:45:37,207 --> 00:45:38,481
Son of a bitch!

695
00:45:38,847 --> 00:45:40,041
This is locked.

696
00:45:41,007 --> 00:45:42,076
Get the fuck back.

697
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:45,080
This is locked.
It’s fuckin’ hot!

698
00:45:46,447 --> 00:45:47,675
-It’s burning...
-Shit!

699
00:45:47,847 --> 00:45:50,441
They’ve welded it,
we can’t get out now.

700
00:45:50,607 --> 00:45:53,599
-Fuckin great!
-But why?

701
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:57,476
Because they followed you,
assholes. Shit!

702
00:45:57,647 --> 00:45:59,365
There must be another exit.

703
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:02,803
What exit? They have orders to shoot.
I hear them over the radio.

704
00:46:04,647 --> 00:46:05,796
And now what?

705
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:09,679
Now you’ll do what I say,
understood?

706
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,804
Understood?

707
00:46:15,007 --> 00:46:17,123
I told you to turn
that fuckin’ camera off.

708
00:46:19,887 --> 00:46:23,323
You wanted to record, right?
Well, record this, let everyone see!

709
00:46:24,127 --> 00:46:26,595
-They’re fooling you...
-What is this?

710
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:29,918
Ask them outside!

711
00:46:30,727 --> 00:46:34,561
No, we’ve got to go now.
My daughter, upstairs...

712
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:39,238
Calm down, you’re putting
all of us in danger.

713
00:46:39,407 --> 00:46:42,365
I too want to find my companions.

714
00:46:42,527 --> 00:46:46,520
But all together.
Shut up! Where is it?

715
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:51,796
-Second floor.
-Okay, come on, then!

716
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:55,801
Let’s go, let’s go, fast!
come on, come on!

717
00:47:05,687 --> 00:47:07,962
-I don’t want to go up.
-Mire, please!

718
00:47:08,127 --> 00:47:10,595
No, please! I don’t want
to go up there!

719
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:13,076
Please, I want to go home!

720
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,124
You should have thought
that before!

721
00:47:17,207 --> 00:47:18,401
Mire, relax...

722
00:47:19,207 --> 00:47:22,040
Fuck, come on.

723
00:47:23,247 --> 00:47:23,963
It’s here.

724
00:47:24,447 --> 00:47:26,324
come on, fast...

725
00:47:26,487 --> 00:47:28,762
Don’t lag behind. Move it fast!

726
00:47:29,287 --> 00:47:32,199
Go on, go on, go on... go on!

727
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:37,285
Shit! Sure it’s here?

728
00:47:37,447 --> 00:47:39,199
-Which one?
-This one.

729
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:41,039
Shit, shit, shit.

730
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:50,044
Move it fast, don’t lag behind!

731
00:47:50,727 --> 00:47:52,240
In, fast!

732
00:47:53,487 --> 00:47:55,125
Tito, please, let’s go.

733
00:47:55,287 --> 00:47:58,484
Be quiet.
Relax.

734
00:47:58,647 --> 00:48:02,481
Jennifer? Mari Carmen?
Jenni...

735
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,281
Mari Carmen!
Where is Jenni?

736
00:48:19,127 --> 00:48:21,038
Mari Carmen, where is the girl?

737
00:48:29,087 --> 00:48:31,999
Take it easy, lady, take it easy!

738
00:48:33,407 --> 00:48:34,283
Shit!

739
00:48:38,367 --> 00:48:39,766
What’s on her face?

740
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:43,716
Hold the camera.

741
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,799
Hold it!

742
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,999
-Where’s the lighter!
-What now, Tito?

743
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:57,361
Tito, what are you doing?

744
00:49:13,647 --> 00:49:15,285
Mari Carmen!

745
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:20,636
We’ll all die,
thanks to your fuckin’ video.

746
00:49:21,927 --> 00:49:24,760
Listen, no one is going to die here...

747
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:28,604
no one.
And what are you doing?

748
00:49:31,527 --> 00:49:33,085
She’s bitten me.

749
00:49:34,727 --> 00:49:36,638
I must stop the infection.

750
00:49:39,127 --> 00:49:41,960
Water... water... water.

751
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:47,763
-You have to help us, please!
-You have to do something, please!

752
00:49:47,927 --> 00:49:49,645
You can get us out.

753
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:52,356
Outside is full
of policemen, please!

754
00:49:52,527 --> 00:49:55,485
Take it easy, relax.
Okay.

755
00:49:56,047 --> 00:49:58,959
Everyone relax.

756
00:50:05,087 --> 00:50:08,477
Don’t go near the windows
for your own safety.

757
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:12,801
I repeat, keep away
from the windows.

758
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:15,720
Tell them we’re kids
and have done nothing.

759
00:50:15,967 --> 00:50:18,037
Snipers, code 3.

760
00:50:24,447 --> 00:50:25,357
What happened?

761
00:50:25,527 --> 00:50:27,358
Down! Get down!

762
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:29,483
What’s going on...?

763
00:50:29,647 --> 00:50:31,797
I don’t know.
They’re shooting.

764
00:50:57,007 --> 00:50:58,486
come on, come on!

765
00:51:02,327 --> 00:51:04,283
Hey, wait! Fuck! Hold it.

766
00:51:04,487 --> 00:51:06,205
Jennifer!

767
00:51:09,087 --> 00:51:09,963
Hold it.

768
00:51:17,967 --> 00:51:19,366
Get back, Larra!

769
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:27,766
Who the fuck are you?

770
00:51:28,007 --> 00:51:30,475
SWAT.
What should we do?

771
00:51:31,247 --> 00:51:33,761
They’re cops, they have to help us.

772
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:38,119
Fast... don’t let them get away!

773
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:45,480
Be quiet! Be quiet!

774
00:51:47,087 --> 00:51:48,918
Where the fuck are they?

775
00:51:49,687 --> 00:51:50,642
Be quiet.

776
00:51:57,167 --> 00:51:58,725
What do we do now?

777
00:51:59,767 --> 00:52:02,884
I want to get out of here,
to get out, please!

778
00:52:03,047 --> 00:52:06,881
Well, fuck you!
We’ll never get out of here.

779
00:52:07,047 --> 00:52:08,958
We’ll all die for your fault!

780
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:11,880
Shut the fuck up! Shit, shut up!

781
00:52:14,607 --> 00:52:17,804
What’s going on?
What is this?

782
00:52:28,887 --> 00:52:31,401
Uri, there’s something here.

783
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,406
A helmet.

784
00:52:38,567 --> 00:52:40,637
-What could have happened?
-Give me that.

785
00:52:46,287 --> 00:52:47,356
Daddy...

786
00:52:48,447 --> 00:52:49,766
Is that you, Daddy?

787
00:52:49,927 --> 00:52:50,916
Who’s that?

788
00:52:57,087 --> 00:52:57,963
The child.

789
00:52:58,767 --> 00:52:59,597
I’m here.

790
00:52:59,767 --> 00:53:00,563
Jennifer?

791
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:06,078
Daddy, I’m afraid.

792
00:53:14,967 --> 00:53:16,002
Jennifer?

793
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:18,002
It’s over there.

794
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,806
What should we do?

795
00:53:22,727 --> 00:53:24,957
We must get her out of there.

796
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:32,240
-What is this?
-Daddy, open up.

797
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:34,557
Open up, please.

798
00:53:34,727 --> 00:53:37,002
-We have to help her, please!
-No!

799
00:53:52,407 --> 00:53:54,716
The girl... where is the girl?

800
00:53:55,767 --> 00:53:59,396
We’ve done nothing.
We just want to help her.

801
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:08,401
-Go away, go...!
-No!

802
00:54:23,607 --> 00:54:27,441
The pistol, the pistol.
Shoot him!

803
00:54:28,287 --> 00:54:29,322
Shoot!

804
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:35,803
-The pistol!
-Shoot him!

805
00:54:38,327 --> 00:54:39,601
Shoot!

806
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,079
Kill him, please!

807
00:54:43,247 --> 00:54:44,362
Shoot, Mire!

808
00:54:45,007 --> 00:54:48,841
Mire! Fuck, Mire!
Shoot!

809
00:55:16,207 --> 00:55:19,324
Hold it!
Don’t move. Hold it!

810
00:55:19,487 --> 00:55:22,001
-Please help us!
-Don’t move... freeze!

811
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:24,886
We haven’t done anything, please.

812
00:55:25,047 --> 00:55:27,117
Relax, relax.

813
00:55:32,727 --> 00:55:35,287
Where is he? Where is he?

814
00:55:35,447 --> 00:55:38,439
-He attacked us.
-But where is he?

815
00:55:39,447 --> 00:55:40,800
I killed him.

816
00:55:42,007 --> 00:55:45,283
Okay, it’s okay.
Just give me the gun, slowly.

817
00:55:45,447 --> 00:55:48,962
Why’d you open the door?
You shouldn’t have done that!

818
00:55:49,127 --> 00:55:51,561
He talked like a little girl,
and we thought...

819
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:55,163
What the fuck were you thinking?
What the fuck are you doing here?

820
00:55:55,327 --> 00:55:57,477
I don’t know, I don’t know.

821
00:55:58,927 --> 00:56:00,406
What do we do now?

822
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:03,764
You tell me.
That was our last chance.

823
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:06,361
We’re back where we started.

824
00:56:07,727 --> 00:56:10,082
What’s wrong with you?

825
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:13,886
It hurts a lot.
I think he bit me.

826
00:56:14,047 --> 00:56:16,766
-Stay back!
-No, no, what are you doing?

827
00:56:21,327 --> 00:56:25,081
Grab him, we need him.

828
00:56:26,607 --> 00:56:29,758
Relax, kid, just relax.
Everything’s okay.

829
00:56:29,927 --> 00:56:31,679
-No, no, no!
-What are you doing?

830
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:43,235
That door, we must lock them in!

831
00:56:46,807 --> 00:56:48,798
come on, come on, put her inside.

832
00:56:51,327 --> 00:56:52,680
Quick, close it.

833
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:57,881
We have to block it.
Get that piece!

834
00:56:58,407 --> 00:57:00,875
come on, quick, move it.

835
00:57:02,807 --> 00:57:05,116
Shit! He got away.

836
00:57:05,287 --> 00:57:08,085
-Don’t run, kid.
-Don’t let him get away.

837
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:12,843
come on, bring him here.

838
00:57:20,767 --> 00:57:21,358
Help me!

839
00:57:21,727 --> 00:57:24,958
Rosso, get the camera,
we need it.

840
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:27,921
We must record everything,
document it.

841
00:57:29,967 --> 00:57:31,764
-Shit!
-What’s wrong?

842
00:57:31,927 --> 00:57:33,918
The battery is about to die.

843
00:57:34,087 --> 00:57:37,921
So what?
Let’s get this over.

844
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:41,875
No, we need proof. I told you,
those are the orders!

845
00:58:14,047 --> 00:58:16,720
Okay, the sound
seems to be coming in.

846
00:58:16,887 --> 00:58:18,639
-Does it work?
-I’m working on it.

847
00:58:18,807 --> 00:58:19,956
come on, Rosso.

848
00:58:22,327 --> 00:58:23,555
Okay!

849
00:58:27,367 --> 00:58:28,322
Recording!

850
00:58:28,487 --> 00:58:32,321
Now I am going to ask you
once again.

851
00:58:33,407 --> 00:58:36,205
Who are you and
what are you doing here?

852
00:58:39,647 --> 00:58:42,764
We came to make a TV show,
and that’s it.

853
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:44,486
A TV show...

854
00:58:44,847 --> 00:58:46,758
...I hid because...

855
00:58:48,207 --> 00:58:51,324
She must be the TV anchor
who came in with the firemen.

856
00:58:53,247 --> 00:58:56,125
-Stay back, we can’t be sure.
-Careful.

857
00:58:56,287 --> 00:58:57,925
Make sure.

858
00:58:58,327 --> 00:59:02,081
come here, come here.

859
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:04,520
Turn around!

860
00:59:04,687 --> 00:59:07,997
-What is this?
-None of your business. Relax.

861
00:59:08,167 --> 00:59:08,963
Careful.

862
00:59:09,127 --> 00:59:09,877
Relax.

863
00:59:11,527 --> 00:59:13,722
Look at me, look at me....!

864
00:59:17,127 --> 00:59:20,961
-She seems to be okay.
-She started it all.

865
00:59:21,847 --> 00:59:24,042
-What?
-I saw her.

866
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:27,998
-Who?
-I don’t know, it was dark.

867
00:59:28,887 --> 00:59:31,606
The girl Medeiros?
It must be her!

868
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:33,723
-I don’t know.
-Where?

869
00:59:33,887 --> 00:59:35,400
In the penthouse.

870
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:37,876
There’s no one there.

871
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:41,006
Wherever she is,
it’s time to find out.

872
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,083
Let’s go.

873
00:59:59,527 --> 01:00:03,281
You shouldn’t insist so much,
I warned you last time.

874
01:00:03,447 --> 01:00:07,281
Last time you were lucky.
But not this one...

875
01:00:08,207 --> 01:00:10,084
Now tell me where you are.

876
01:00:12,327 --> 01:00:14,283
Tell me.

877
01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:19,437
In the name of God Almighty,
who orders you,...

878
01:00:19,607 --> 01:00:21,006
tell me where you are.

879
01:00:23,327 --> 01:00:25,204
Everywhere.

880
01:00:25,367 --> 01:00:29,155
No, the original body,
the girl,

881
01:00:30,047 --> 01:00:32,038
that’s where you hide.

882
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:35,483
Don’t be so smart.
If you were you’d be running.

883
01:00:35,647 --> 01:00:37,922
Under the protection of God.

884
01:00:38,087 --> 01:00:40,601
He gives me the power to
walk over snakes, and

885
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:43,122
win over all my enemies.

886
01:00:43,327 --> 01:00:45,045
Where are you?

887
01:00:47,447 --> 01:00:49,677
In your mother’s cunt!

888
01:00:49,847 --> 01:00:52,407
Look there,
you will enjoy it.

889
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:54,717
Your tricks work no longer.

890
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:56,879
Tell me where you are.

891
01:00:59,567 --> 01:01:01,956
I will not fear the night terrors,

892
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:05,245
nor the arrow that flies by day,

893
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,398
nor the plague that
stalks the darkness,

894
01:01:08,327 --> 01:01:11,478
in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit,

895
01:01:11,647 --> 01:01:13,046
tell me where you are.

896
01:01:14,687 --> 01:01:16,359
High above.

897
01:01:17,247 --> 01:01:19,761
Your blasphemy
doesn’t scare me.

898
01:01:20,847 --> 01:01:22,121
Where are you?

899
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:25,281
I told you, high above.

900
01:01:25,447 --> 01:01:27,563
Perhaps you’re afraid, priest?

901
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:31,677
In the penthouse.

902
01:01:31,847 --> 01:01:34,839
She’s not there,
there’s nothing there.

903
01:01:35,727 --> 01:01:37,365
The light blinds you.

904
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:40,121
In God’s name, where?

905
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:43,761
The light doesn’t let
you see the path.

906
01:01:43,927 --> 01:01:45,918
What a shame, don’t you think?

907
01:01:46,087 --> 01:01:47,964
What fuckin’ light?

908
01:01:48,887 --> 01:01:52,641
You said it was dark.
How’d you see her?

909
01:01:53,207 --> 01:01:54,003
What?

910
01:01:54,687 --> 01:01:57,121
How’d you see her if it was dark?

911
01:01:57,287 --> 01:01:59,164
The camera...

912
01:01:59,767 --> 01:02:01,246
It has night vision.

913
01:02:03,527 --> 01:02:05,961
-I should have imagined.
-What?

914
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:09,356
...And the angels who
lost their dignity,

915
01:02:09,527 --> 01:02:12,166
but abandoned their own dwellings,

916
01:02:12,327 --> 01:02:16,161
The Lord kept them in eternal
prisons of darkness,

917
01:02:16,927 --> 01:02:19,202
until the final judgment day.

918
01:02:19,367 --> 01:02:20,925
What the fuck are you saying?

919
01:02:21,647 --> 01:02:23,285
Prisons of darkness,

920
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:28,121
where she is, light is not reflected.

921
01:02:29,447 --> 01:02:32,723
Hot, priest, hot,
but don’t get excited.

922
01:02:34,567 --> 01:02:35,602
In the penthouse!

923
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:38,963
Let’s go!

924
01:02:41,087 --> 01:02:44,921
Rosso, did you fix the spotlight?

925
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:46,236
Yes.

926
01:02:46,407 --> 01:02:49,160
Where are they?
Why don’t they attack us?

927
01:02:49,327 --> 01:02:51,887
I don’t know, but I don’t like it.

928
01:02:54,647 --> 01:02:57,286
Rosso, from now on be on alert.

929
01:02:58,287 --> 01:03:00,801
The night vision will
reveal hidden things,

930
01:03:01,807 --> 01:03:03,399
things we didn’t see.

931
01:03:03,567 --> 01:03:05,876
Where do we start?

932
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:09,686
I think I know.

933
01:03:13,047 --> 01:03:14,844
come on, quick!

934
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:21,566
Please, please, no!

935
01:03:21,727 --> 01:03:24,446
-come on, come on!
-Let’s go!

936
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,559
-Rosso!
-I’m... I’m coming.

937
01:03:30,967 --> 01:03:31,877
In you go!

938
01:03:34,807 --> 01:03:38,163
Now what? Fuck, we were here
before, and there’s nothing.

939
01:03:38,327 --> 01:03:40,079
What are we looking for?

940
01:03:40,247 --> 01:03:43,364
Okay, turn the light off.

941
01:03:43,767 --> 01:03:44,961
Turn it all off.

942
01:03:49,007 --> 01:03:51,396
Night vision, turn it on.

943
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:56,045
What? No, that’s impossible...

944
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,926
-What?
-What the fuck is this?

945
01:03:59,767 --> 01:04:02,645
-What do you see?
-A door...in the back.

946
01:04:03,087 --> 01:04:04,884
A door?
What the fuck are you saying?

947
01:04:05,047 --> 01:04:08,676
-I assure you there was a door.
-Of course... A door...

948
01:04:11,287 --> 01:04:13,755
Okay, turn it off.

949
01:04:14,807 --> 01:04:17,162
-Shit!
-Guide me.

950
01:04:17,847 --> 01:04:19,565
Go to the back.

951
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,042
In front of you.

952
01:04:30,007 --> 01:04:32,282
You’re almost there, 3 steps.

953
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:41,998
You’re touching it.

954
01:04:45,687 --> 01:04:46,597
Get back!

955
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:58,683
Calm down, okay?

956
01:04:58,847 --> 01:05:01,361
Do you want to get out
of here or not?

957
01:05:03,927 --> 01:05:04,962
Let’s go!

958
01:05:09,607 --> 01:05:10,517
Watch it!

959
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,796
Grab on to me, grab on to me.

960
01:05:16,527 --> 01:05:17,596
Be careful.

961
01:05:19,327 --> 01:05:20,521
Rosso, light!

962
01:05:45,367 --> 01:05:46,595
Watch it, chief.

963
01:06:01,447 --> 01:06:02,960
There’s nothing here.

964
01:06:03,127 --> 01:06:05,880
The light doesn’t
let us see. Turn it off!

965
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,918
Go on, search.
Something must be different.

966
01:06:22,247 --> 01:06:24,078
What do you see?

967
01:06:25,007 --> 01:06:26,156
Do you see anything?

968
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:35,601
Shit!

969
01:06:36,687 --> 01:06:38,518
-Here.
-What?

970
01:06:38,687 --> 01:06:40,439
There was something there.

971
01:06:43,127 --> 01:06:45,687
-Where?
-Up front...

972
01:06:45,847 --> 01:06:46,996
Okay.

973
01:06:47,567 --> 01:06:48,283
Turn it off.

974
01:06:51,047 --> 01:06:51,957
There it is.

975
01:06:54,047 --> 01:06:55,036
Watch it!

976
01:06:56,047 --> 01:06:56,843
Guide us!

977
01:06:57,567 --> 01:06:59,876
Chief, not that way. To your left.

978
01:07:00,927 --> 01:07:01,723
Right in front.

979
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,040
-Watch it!
-There, there!

980
01:07:06,687 --> 01:07:07,836
There’s water.

981
01:07:09,247 --> 01:07:11,363
It’s... it’s like a well.

982
01:07:16,327 --> 01:07:17,999
-Be careful, chief.
-There’s something here.

983
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:19,077
Watch it!

984
01:07:24,567 --> 01:07:27,001
Chief, chief!

985
01:07:28,247 --> 01:07:29,123
Shit!

986
01:07:29,647 --> 01:07:32,605
Rosso, where is he?

987
01:07:32,767 --> 01:07:35,361
I don’t know.
He was over there.

988
01:07:35,847 --> 01:07:37,200
Turn it off, off!

989
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,039
Rosso, where is he?

990
01:07:40,207 --> 01:07:42,357
I don’t know. Something
took him away.

991
01:07:44,447 --> 01:07:46,199
Guide me, Rosso!

992
01:07:49,127 --> 01:07:49,923
Holy shit!

993
01:07:54,127 --> 01:07:59,838
Rosso, Rosso, where are you?
What happened, what was that?

994
01:08:00,007 --> 01:08:01,520
Something hit me.

995
01:08:01,727 --> 01:08:04,366
-It’s her.
-Shit, shit!

996
01:08:05,127 --> 01:08:08,278
Is that her? Is it her?
Tell me.

997
01:08:08,447 --> 01:08:10,039
I don’t know!

998
01:08:10,207 --> 01:08:12,482
We have to get out of here now!

999
01:08:12,647 --> 01:08:15,002
I lost the camera!

1000
01:08:15,167 --> 01:08:18,603
Find it, we need it!
Find it, Rosso, for God’s sake!

1001
01:08:18,767 --> 01:08:20,837
I don’t know where it is.
I can see nothing.

1002
01:08:21,007 --> 01:08:23,919
-Well, look for it, Rosso!
-I’m working on it!

1003
01:08:27,727 --> 01:08:30,116
I can’t find it, I can’t!

1004
01:08:39,967 --> 01:08:42,925
I’ve got it, I’ve got it!

1005
01:08:45,807 --> 01:08:48,719
I’m over here.
It’s me, relax.

1006
01:08:50,567 --> 01:08:54,401
-We have to get out of here.
-She’s going to kill us.

1007
01:08:54,567 --> 01:08:56,285
No, we’re getting out.

1008
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,563
No, I need that blood!

1009
01:08:58,727 --> 01:09:01,287
Rosso, where is she?
Can you see her?

1010
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,644
-I see nothing.
-Look for her!

1011
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:08,964
-I can’t see her.
-I need that blood, Rosso.

1012
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:15,117
She can’t see us.
Don’t move.

1013
01:09:15,807 --> 01:09:18,526
If she doesn’t hear us
she can’t find us.

1014
01:10:16,887 --> 01:10:18,684
Doctor. Respond.

1015
01:10:19,087 --> 01:10:20,406
Voice recognition requested.

1016
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:26,637
Doctor, respond.
Please, I repeat, respond.

1017
01:10:27,047 --> 01:10:29,925
Doctor, respond.
Voice recognition requested.

1018
01:10:30,087 --> 01:10:32,442
Doctor, respond.

1019
01:10:48,607 --> 01:10:51,075
What the fuck are you doing?
Stop it!

1020
01:10:55,447 --> 01:10:57,278
You bitch!

1021
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:08,082
Let’s go, let’s go!

1022
01:11:08,247 --> 01:11:10,761
What have you done?
I needed her.

1023
01:11:10,927 --> 01:11:13,395
-I don’t care.
-I needed that blood.

1024
01:11:13,567 --> 01:11:15,603
I don’t care.
We’re out of here.

1025
01:11:17,567 --> 01:11:19,205
Wait, wait...

1026
01:11:19,367 --> 01:11:22,006
we can’t leave until
he gives the order.

1027
01:11:22,167 --> 01:11:23,566
What is that?

1028
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:26,400
Helicopters.

1029
01:11:31,007 --> 01:11:32,201
Give the order!

1030
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:35,598
Not until my mission is finished.

1031
01:11:35,967 --> 01:11:37,958
I said: Give the order!

1032
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,278
And I said I have
to finish the mission.

1033
01:11:41,447 --> 01:11:44,484
Nothing more can be done.
Get us out of here!

1034
01:11:45,087 --> 01:11:47,317
Give the fucking order!

1035
01:11:50,047 --> 01:11:51,526
What the fuck are you doing?

1036
01:11:54,087 --> 01:11:55,600
-Give the order.
-I can’t.

1037
01:11:55,767 --> 01:11:56,995
-Stop.
-I want out!

1038
01:11:59,367 --> 01:12:00,595
What are you doing?

1039
01:12:01,767 --> 01:12:04,679
-I can’t.
-Yes you can.

1040
01:12:04,847 --> 01:12:07,759
-Stop it.
-Of course you can!

1041
01:12:09,687 --> 01:12:11,325
Listen to me.

1042
01:12:12,767 --> 01:12:13,722
Get away!

1043
01:12:16,247 --> 01:12:17,236
Give it!

1044
01:12:19,647 --> 01:12:20,682
Calm down.

1045
01:12:23,287 --> 01:12:25,801
I must finish... the mission.

1046
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:28,004
You’re mission is over.

1047
01:12:28,527 --> 01:12:31,325
Hold it, stop!

1048
01:12:31,887 --> 01:12:33,718
You’re out of your fuckin’ mind!

1049
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:36,241
What are you doing?

1050
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:41,438
Listen well.
You can’t short him.

1051
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:44,446
We need him to get out.
Don’t you get it?

1052
01:12:45,687 --> 01:12:46,836
Calm down.

1053
01:13:27,247 --> 01:13:29,556
Don’t make it any more difficult.

1054
01:13:30,887 --> 01:13:33,037
Give the order.

1055
01:13:38,127 --> 01:13:39,640
How did you do it?

1056
01:13:54,047 --> 01:13:55,685
You can’t force me!

1057
01:13:57,167 --> 01:14:00,364
God protects me.

1058
01:14:10,007 --> 01:14:13,602
I’d have loved you getting
me out of here.

1059
01:14:15,967 --> 01:14:18,037
It would have been perfect.

1060
01:14:21,447 --> 01:14:22,926
But, you know what?

1061
01:14:32,967 --> 01:14:35,117
I don’t need you.

1062
01:14:37,527 --> 01:14:39,085
You know that, right?

1063
01:15:00,087 --> 01:15:01,884
Voice recognition requested.

1064
01:15:02,287 --> 01:15:03,117
Owen.

1065
01:15:08,327 --> 01:15:10,124
Voice recognition confirmed.

1066
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:13,446
The mission is over,
I request evacuation.

1067
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:17,400
Any survivors?

1068
01:15:18,487 --> 01:15:20,159
Just one, a woman.

1069
01:15:21,247 --> 01:15:23,124
I’m staying, I’m infected.

1070
01:15:24,127 --> 01:15:27,039
Follow the plan and
burn it all.

1071
01:15:28,247 --> 01:15:32,081
