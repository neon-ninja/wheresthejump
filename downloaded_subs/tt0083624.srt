1
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,982
Who's there?

2
00:01:55,312 --> 00:01:58,966
- Glens Falls Police Department.
- This is Dr. Lifflander. I want ...

3
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:23,672
Hello?  Can you send
someone to ...? Hello hello.

4
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:25,760
Oh God!

5
00:02:54,947 --> 00:02:56,947
Oh, God ... no!
No!

6
00:03:04,647 --> 00:03:05,777
I've got a gun!

7
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,170
I'll shoot!
Get out or I'll shoot!

8
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:16,894
Smoke, smoke I've got joints in bags,
leaves and dime bag, gold Colombian smoke.

9
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:20,591
I've got acid, blanche, rainbow,
wonder paint, speeds, downs,

10
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:23,158
Seconal, Valium,
mescaline, THC,

11
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,508
I've got some good cocaine,
peyote, cannabis, grass, angel dust,

12
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:32,249
Check it out man!
Tranquilizers, amphetamines, white,

13
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,773
ecstasy, methadone,
marijuana, morphine ...

14
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:37,773
What do you want? Some girls?
I've got some nice girls.

15
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:39,730
What the fuck is wrong
with you anyway, man?

16
00:04:57,825 --> 00:05:00,044
I sold it to Dirty Lou.
You remember him.

17
00:05:00,044 --> 00:05:02,306
He looks like Smuggle in the comics.

18
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:06,263
Dirty Lou ...
The name sounds so familiar.

19
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:07,960
Wait a minute ...
Didn't he get run over?

20
00:05:08,004 --> 00:05:11,657
It was suicide. He hailed a cab
and when it pulled up to the kerb,

21
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:13,092
he jumped in front of it.

22
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:15,398
Get out of here!
You're full of crap!

23
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:16,921
Company ...

24
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,225
I'd like a room.

25
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:22,053
- For how long?
- I'm not sure ...

26
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,402
A couple of hours?   A couple
of years?  What?  Give me a hint.

27
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,751
- A few days.
- Are you by yourself?

28
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,665
Yes, alone, by myself.

29
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:34,102
All alone in this
cold, cruel world ...

30
00:05:34,798 --> 00:05:37,799
20 bucks a night.
In advance ...

31
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:40,713
And if you pay by the
day, it's due at noon.

32
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:44,802
And I don't want no junkies in here,
cause this is a respectable hotel.

33
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,498
I just need a place to stay.

34
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:50,413
- What's in the basket?
- Clothes.

35
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:54,284
He's smoking thru' a case of booze.
He's going to throw us a party!

36
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,765
- Room 7, third floor.
- Great!

37
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:03,070
20 bucks.

38
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:05,158
Oh, right.

39
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:25,906
- Is this stuff real?
- Hmm.

40
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:37,868
- Did you see that? He's loaded!
- So are you.

41
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:49,134
Hi, I'm Josephine.
What room are you in?

42
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:51,439
- Seven.
- Oh, you're so lucky!

43
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,571
That's the best room in the place!

44
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:57,137
It was lived in by a little old lady
who only went out on Sundays.

45
00:06:57,181 --> 00:07:00,051
She lived there for ages.
Used to tell everyone she was rich

46
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,357
on oil well in Texas.
Had millions ...

47
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:05,489
and was hiding from her relatives
who were trying to steal it from her.

48
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:10,448
She'd creep up to you and say:
"They try to take my money,"

49
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:14,319
"... But don't know where I am!"

50
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:16,449
Everyone thought she was nuts.

51
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:20,843
Then one day, she appeared in the
lobby, dressed with pearls and jewels.

52
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:22,975
Said she was leaving
to tour the world.

53
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,541
She paid her bill and left.
No one heard from her since.

54
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,669
We're here.

55
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:05,322
Is there any place I can get
something to eat around here?

56
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:08,672
- Nothing too fancy, I hope.
- No, just pizza or burgers.

57
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,934
- Yeah, there're plenty ...
- There's one right across the street.

58
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:12,325
Great, thanks.

59
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:45,470
Got you something to eat.

60
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:54,387
Take your time!
There's plenty.

61
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:19,180
<i> PATIENT: DUANE BRADLEY
MD. H.Needleman and J.Kutter</i>

62
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:32,186
Finished already?

63
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:48,976
Damn!
Kutter's name isn't listed.

64
00:10:50,193 --> 00:10:52,281
Well, Needleman must
have the number.

65
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:37,779
You're not going to pace
the floor all night are you?

66
00:11:42,608 --> 00:11:46,697
No. I don't want to talk now.
Go back to sleep!

67
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:53,568
Oh, come on!
I got to get up early.

68
00:11:58,136 --> 00:11:59,745
We've been through
this before, you know.

69
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:03,965
Look, I'm not going to
stay up half the night talking.

70
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:06,792
It's 3:30 in the morning.
Go back to sleep!

71
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:17,405
I'm not going to debate this!
Now good night!

72
00:12:25,322 --> 00:12:29,323
For Christ sake!
Shut up and let me get some sleep!

73
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:34,413
Always waste time to
start a conversation.

74
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:38,832
Oh, great!

75
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:43,181
Last week you were in the dumb
waiter, this week it's keyholes!

76
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:45,704
- There's somebody in there.
- I figured that!

77
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:48,227
You should see ... he's got a
roll of bills in them.  Like this.

78
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,706
Oh, give me a break!

79
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:52,445
He's kind of letting him run
loose ... in his pocket!

80
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:56,274
You've got two seconds before
I start pounding on his door.

81
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:57,839
- No, wait ...
- One ..

82
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,145
I'm going!

83
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:03,451
Keyhole peekers,
cockroaches as big as dogs,

84
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:06,278
saxophones playing at
4 o'clock in the morning

85
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,931
and that crazy broad across the hall,

86
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:13,368
who I know is pissing on
my door step, I mean ...!

87
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:21,154
Just a minute!

88
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:31,419
Hi, I live across the hall and ...

89
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:33,028
Well, the reason I'm bothering is ...

90
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:35,769
now I don't want you think I go
around butting into people's business

91
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:38,031
but somebody has been
snooping around your door,

92
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:40,031
you know, peeking
through the keyhole and shit.

93
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:43,207
So, if you have anything of value
in there, like money or something,

94
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:45,294
I wouldn't leave it laying around.

95
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:47,034
Right, sure.

96
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:49,775
You know I can't stand to
see somebody get ripped off.

97
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:53,211
Especially without a fighting
chance.  My name is Casey.

98
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:56,343
- Duane Bradley.
- Nice meeting you, Duane Bradley.

99
00:14:56,343 --> 00:14:58,170
What the hell are
you doing in this dump?

100
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:00,867
It was the first hotel I came to.

101
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,955
Obviously, a hard man to
please. Where are you from?

102
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:05,521
Upstate.

103
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:07,782
- Oh, first time in New York?
- Yeah.

104
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:09,697
Listen, we have to go
for a drink some time.

105
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:12,262
- Okay, sure.
- Catch you later kid. Bye.

106
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,271
Come one. We gotta pay a little
visit to a doctor friend of mine.

107
00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:17,638
Now the drugstore said he never
should have prescribed it to me

108
00:16:17,638 --> 00:16:18,900
in the first place.

109
00:16:18,987 --> 00:16:21,814
It's the wrong drug!
I'm allergic to it!

110
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,728
That's terrible!
Does he know you're allergic?

111
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:28,078
Well, he should. It's the second time
he gave me the wrong prescription.

112
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:30,166
The first time was
just as bad!

113
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,079
Oh, my goodness!

114
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:34,950
I'll be right with you.
It's this typewriter.

115
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,734
It was terrible!

116
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:39,170
First I got dizzy,

117
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:41,388
then I couldn't breathe

118
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:44,215
then my throat
felt like it was on fire!

119
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:47,477
Well, you make sure and
tell all this to the doctor.

120
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,438
Okay, this is the one!

121
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,092
Hear that?

122
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:04,311
Sounds like
something grinding inside.

123
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:06,398
And the carriage won't return.

124
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:11,574
Yesterday it was squeaking,
like if a mouse was caught inside.

125
00:17:11,574 --> 00:17:14,880
Real high-pitched, like ...

126
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,101
I don't know anything about typewriters.
I just want to see the doctor.

127
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:26,233
Oh, my goodness, I'm sorry!
I just assumed ...

128
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,451
Oh, I didn't think you were a patient.

129
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:31,236
I'm expecting someone to fix
the typewriter this afternoon,

130
00:17:31,236 --> 00:17:35,802
and I just thought, I figured that
was your toolbox or something.

131
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:38,890
Dr. Needleman is an
old friend of the family.

132
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,457
Is there any chance I could
see him without an appointment?

133
00:17:41,457 --> 00:17:45,284
He'll tell you no,
friend of the family or not!

134
00:17:45,328 --> 00:17:49,808
But as you can see, we have hundreds
of patients waiting to see him.

135
00:17:49,808 --> 00:17:52,505
So we'll just pretend you did call

136
00:17:52,592 --> 00:17:55,985
and have an appointment
for ... 11:30 ...

137
00:17:57,551 --> 00:17:59,290
You're next!

138
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:00,726
Thanks!

139
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:02,031
What's your name?

140
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:03,423
Duane Bradley.

141
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:05,076
Oh, but don't write that ...!

142
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:09,643
I want to surprise him, and he'd
recognize that name right away.

143
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:13,123
Put down something like ... Smith,
Duane Smith.

144
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:16,864
He'll appreciate this.
He's a million laughs.

145
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:20,169
Okay and you fill out the rest.

146
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:34,523
What's in the basket?
Easter eggs?

147
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,615
Just visiting New York or ...?

148
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:46,833
Yes, this is my first time.

149
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:50,530
So have you gone to the Empire State
Building yet and the Statue of Liberty?

150
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:52,227
No, I haven't had time.

151
00:18:52,227 --> 00:18:54,358
Haven't had the time?

152
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:57,447
What about the Radio City
Music Hall? Or the UN?

153
00:18:57,664 --> 00:19:01,230
- Had time for them?
- No, I ...

154
00:19:01,318 --> 00:19:04,710
What about the World Trade Towers?
Or the Trolley-cars?

155
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:07,277
- It's not that I don't want to, but ...
- The Met?

156
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,103
The Cloisters?
Grummans Chinese?

157
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,887
It's just that I don't
know where anything is.

158
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:16,106
Oh, if you need a Tour Guide
I'd be happy to volunteer ...

159
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:23,413
Or even buy you some 3D postcards
and an "I Love New York" T-shirt.

160
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,242
You're next!

161
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:40,290
Come in.

162
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:42,161
Yes, sir ...

163
00:19:42,204 --> 00:19:43,857
Smith.

164
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:47,555
Smith.

165
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:50,078
All right.

166
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:54,645
Mr. Smith ...
What seems to be the problem?

167
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:58,255
My chest.
I've got this pain and ...

168
00:19:58,342 --> 00:20:00,995
Well, why not you put
whatever that is down,

169
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:04,997
take off your shirt,
step in there and see.

170
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:48,842
So, what did he give you?
48 hours to live?

171
00:20:48,842 --> 00:20:51,277
No. We just had a nice chat.

172
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:56,410
- Was he surprised?
- Oh, yeah. Very.

173
00:20:56,801 --> 00:21:00,238
Anyway. Coming back to what
we were talking about before,

174
00:21:00,238 --> 00:21:03,065
I get off here tonight at 7:00.

175
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:04,892
Feeling keen?

176
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:08,328
Well, I'd like to ...

177
00:21:08,677 --> 00:21:11,939
... But I can't.
Not tonight.

178
00:21:13,678 --> 00:21:16,724
Can't say I didn't try.

179
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:30,120
- Can I call you tomorrow?
- 233-3000.

180
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:33,252
He doesn't have hours on Wednesday.
I have the whole day free.

181
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:36,036
- Where do you live?
- I'll write it down.

182
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:39,951
It's all the way downtown.

183
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:43,126
Why are we whispering?

184
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:46,084
- I don't want him to hear.
- Who? Does the doctor?

185
00:21:46,128 --> 00:21:47,476
I'll see you later.

186
00:22:13,182 --> 00:22:14,791
Lifflander.

187
00:23:39,611 --> 00:23:42,090
Not now.
Not yet.

188
00:23:44,438 --> 00:23:47,093
Save it.

189
00:24:57,949 --> 00:25:01,081
- That was delicious.
- So are you.

190
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:03,037
Come on, have some more!

191
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:05,908
No, really.
I've had enough.

192
00:25:05,908 --> 00:25:08,257
Nonsense!
We're just beginning.

193
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:12,564
Listen, if I have any more,
I won't be liable to ...

194
00:25:12,564 --> 00:25:16,696
That's alright, I like you drunk.
You're cute when you slobber.

195
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,176
Shit!

196
00:25:21,524 --> 00:25:23,699
Excuse me for a minute, love.

197
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:35,921
Dr. Kutter speaking.

198
00:25:35,921 --> 00:25:38,835
- This is Needleman.
- Who?

199
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:44,708
Harold, I thought I made it clear,
you weren't to call me again, ever.

200
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:47,753
You remember Lifflander?
From Glens Falls?

201
00:25:47,753 --> 00:25:50,797
Well, a few days ago he left a
message on my answering service

202
00:25:50,797 --> 00:25:52,624
that I was to get in touch with him.

203
00:25:52,668 --> 00:25:54,712
- So?
- So ...

204
00:25:54,712 --> 00:26:00,671
So today, a young man comes to see me,
about 20 years old, using a phony name,

205
00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:03,238
and nothing's wrong with him,
except he's from Glens Falls

206
00:26:03,238 --> 00:26:06,109
and he has a deep scar
running down his right side.

207
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:08,718
Please Harold, I'm in
the middle of dinner.

208
00:26:08,718 --> 00:26:10,371
But what he said about Lifflander?

209
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:11,850
I've been trying to get
him and I get no answer.

210
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,807
And this kid says it's
because Lifflander is dead!

211
00:26:14,851 --> 00:26:17,200
Murdered!
Cut in half!

212
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:21,375
Calm down now, Harold
and pay attention. Ready?

213
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:24,072
Neither of us know any Dr. Lifflander

214
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:26,725
and neither of us have
ever been in Glens Falls.

215
00:26:26,943 --> 00:26:31,031
But one of us wants to get
back to her dinner. Good night!

216
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:37,774
Sorry about that Cuddles.
Now, where were we?

217
00:27:17,573 --> 00:27:19,966
Are you leaving now
or should I lock up?

218
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:25,447
No, I'll be a while, but ...
go and lock up anyway.

219
00:27:25,664 --> 00:27:28,317
Okay.
See you on Thursday.

220
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:27,865
She just left.
He's in there alone.

221
00:28:57,182 --> 00:28:59,617
Don't forget the adress book.

222
00:29:01,444 --> 00:29:03,619
Hurry up.
I'll be outside.

223
00:32:41,408 --> 00:32:43,670
Did you get his address book?

224
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:45,802
Great!

225
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:50,673
Kutter is listed.  He's got
her address.  We're in luck.

226
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:22,078
I brought you some goodies.

227
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,776
But first, breakfast.

228
00:33:44,914 --> 00:33:48,611
I also got you a surprise.
But don't look till I'm ready.

229
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:52,439
I don't see any reason why
you need to come with me today.

230
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:54,918
I'm just going to case
Kutter's apartment.

231
00:33:54,918 --> 00:33:58,963
I gotta find out if she's home
or when she'll be back.

232
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:02,138
Maybe I can find
out where she works.

233
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:03,573
It's going to be dull.

234
00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:06,793
So I figured you'd have
a better time here ...

235
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:08,881
... with this!

236
00:34:18,928 --> 00:34:20,276
Great, huh?

237
00:34:20,494 --> 00:34:23,235
Got it on 14th Street.
Even has a guarantee.

238
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:24,800
Listen, I don't know
how long I'll be,

239
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,976
but if you get tired of watching
TV, I also got you the paper.

240
00:34:27,976 --> 00:34:29,368
See you later!

241
00:35:23,565 --> 00:35:27,784
I got to get these boots off.
My feet are killing me!

242
00:35:29,698 --> 00:35:32,046
That was a rare thrill!

243
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:35,831
Every time the wind blew,
I thought I was going to collapse.

244
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:37,440
Listen ...

245
00:35:37,484 --> 00:35:39,441
Don't get mad or anything, but ...

246
00:35:39,441 --> 00:35:45,487
I really don't want to see the city.
I just said that as an excuse to see you.

247
00:35:45,575 --> 00:35:47,096
You're not mad?

248
00:35:47,096 --> 00:35:48,663
You dummy!

249
00:35:49,011 --> 00:35:53,708
I suggested we tour this city for the
same reason you went along with it.

250
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:56,492
I wanted to be with you too.

251
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:01,320
- You did?
- Duane!

252
00:36:02,146 --> 00:36:05,147
I know an awful lot of guys, Duane,

253
00:36:05,278 --> 00:36:07,018
but you're ...

254
00:36:07,105 --> 00:36:08,714
... different.

255
00:36:08,758 --> 00:36:11,150
Don't you have girls upstate?

256
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:15,282
Well, I keep pretty
much to myself.

257
00:36:15,326 --> 00:36:18,545
You're a dying breed, Duane.

258
00:37:27,313 --> 00:37:30,184
- What the hell is going on in here?
- Sounds like an animal.

259
00:37:30,272 --> 00:37:32,446
- Why don't you check it out, man?
- It's wrecking up the place, man.

260
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:34,447
Alright now, check it out!

261
00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:40,581
In here!
In here!

262
00:37:58,893 --> 00:38:01,806
What the hell is going on up there?

263
00:38:01,806 --> 00:38:03,459
Come!  Let's go!

264
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:10,941
I trying to get some sleep, but
that guy above me, he's gone crazy!

265
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:12,898
I know, I know.

266
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:17,030
I gotta get some sleep!

267
00:38:27,295 --> 00:38:29,514
Get out of the way, will you!
Come on, let me through!

268
00:38:29,514 --> 00:38:31,210
Get out of the way!

269
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,169
In here!
In here!

270
00:38:35,169 --> 00:38:36,865
Come on,
back up, please.

271
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:39,475
Back off!
Move back! Huh.

272
00:38:49,045 --> 00:38:51,219
What the hell going on here?

273
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:53,828
Looks like a God damn
bomb hit this place!

274
00:38:53,828 --> 00:38:55,481
Where is the kid?

275
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:57,048
He went out earlier today.

276
00:38:57,048 --> 00:39:00,180
Well, no one came out of here,
I've been standing here all the time.

277
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,790
All the while it was being wrecked.
Someone's got to be in here!

278
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:07,139
Unless they climbed out the window,
because this just doesn't make any sense.

279
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:10,967
- These things couldn't get
thrown around by themselves...
- Come on, out, out.

280
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:14,142
I heard them screaming, they couldn't
have gotten out without me seeing them.

281
00:39:14,142 --> 00:39:16,622
I mean, I was the first one here and
I've been leaning right against the door

282
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:17,708
and no one came out.

283
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,188
Which means they're still in
here.   Somewhere in here.

284
00:39:20,188 --> 00:39:21,841
Well, whoever was in
here, he ain't here now.

285
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:23,016
But that's impossible!

286
00:39:23,016 --> 00:39:24,842
- Oh really. You see anybody?
- There is something wrong in here.

287
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:27,713
- I know there is something!
- Come on.  Donovan! Donovan!

288
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,366
Come on Donovan! Come on.
Let's go! Break it up.

289
00:39:30,366 --> 00:39:32,628
I don't want anybody
congregating around the hallway.

290
00:39:32,628 --> 00:39:35,412
Come on, get back to your room.
There's nothing here to see any more.

291
00:39:35,412 --> 00:39:38,761
Come on!  Go back to your rooms!
Come on, move it!

292
00:39:38,761 --> 00:39:40,109
Come on O'Donovan.

293
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:44,503
No, I'm going to my room.
I'm going to lie down for a while.

294
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:46,591
All right, everybody!
Come on, break it up!

295
00:39:46,591 --> 00:39:49,809
Get out of here, let's go.  Come on, guys.
Back to your room.  Please, let's go.

296
00:39:50,027 --> 00:39:52,724
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

297
00:39:53,029 --> 00:39:56,638
Look, if this happens again ...

298
00:39:56,943 --> 00:39:59,465
I don't know.
What do I know?

299
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:02,206
I only rent the place.  Why
should anybody tell me anything?

300
00:40:02,206 --> 00:40:05,817
I don't know nothing.  Why should
I know everything?  No reason for it.

301
00:41:30,418 --> 00:41:32,549
Duane, are you all right?

302
00:41:36,899 --> 00:41:38,247
Move it!

303
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:47,686
Got to get back.

304
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,167
Duane, wait!
Duane!

305
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:55,559
Down here!  Please hurry.
I don't know what's going on!

306
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:27,181
Oh, God!

307
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:44,537
Alright, clear the lobby.
Come on.

308
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,929
- Come on, Marlin, outside. Let's go!
- What happened?

309
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:50,148
Someone killed O'Donovan
and ripped him to pieces.

310
00:42:50,191 --> 00:42:53,279
- They just carried him away.
- But the culprit was scaring everyone.

311
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:55,149
- You can't come in here!
- But I only want ...

312
00:42:55,149 --> 00:42:56,802
Get out of here!

313
00:42:57,629 --> 00:43:00,631
- You heard what they said?
He killed O'Donovan!
- Who?

314
00:43:00,631 --> 00:43:03,197
I don't want him kill you!

315
00:43:06,807 --> 00:43:10,940
Thanks.  You've been very helpful.
We'll probably have more questions ...

316
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:22,727
Would you hold it a minute?

317
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:26,206
- Do you live here?
- Yes

318
00:43:26,206 --> 00:43:28,251
- What's your name?
- Duane Bradley.

319
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:30,730
- How long you been out, Duane?
- Since this morning.

320
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:34,993
- Do you have pets? Any animals in there?
- No, nothing.  Why?

321
00:43:34,993 --> 00:43:35,994
Oh, one of your neighbors,

322
00:43:36,037 --> 00:43:39,038
a Mr Brian Mickey O'Donovan
was murdered a few hours ago.

323
00:43:39,082 --> 00:43:40,995
And we're just questioning
everybody in the building.

324
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:43,257
- Mind if we come in?
- No.

325
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:57,046
Duane, right before the murder,

326
00:43:57,046 --> 00:44:00,134
some of the tenants claim to have
heard noises coming from this room.

327
00:44:00,743 --> 00:44:03,701
Like someone on a rampage.

328
00:44:03,701 --> 00:44:07,528
- Any idea who it was?
- No, I don't know.  I was out.

329
00:44:08,964 --> 00:44:10,748
What happened?

330
00:44:11,225 --> 00:44:14,706
That was an accident.  It happened last
night.  We went out for burgers, and ...

331
00:44:14,924 --> 00:44:16,141
We?

332
00:44:16,315 --> 00:44:18,707
No, me.  Just me.

333
00:44:18,707 --> 00:44:22,492
And you don't own any pets?
No dogs or anything?

334
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:23,796
No.

335
00:44:25,884 --> 00:44:27,972
What's in the basket?

336
00:44:35,672 --> 00:44:37,237
Nothing ...

337
00:44:40,499 --> 00:44:42,240
Duane, where are you from?

338
00:44:42,979 --> 00:44:45,675
Upstate.  Glens Falls.  Upstate.

339
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:53,505
Do you always leave
money lying around like that?

340
00:44:57,376 --> 00:44:59,420
Uh, must have
fallen off the dresser.

341
00:44:59,682 --> 00:45:03,161
- And you've been out all day?
- Yes, since about 9:00.

342
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:05,902
- Alone or ...?
- With someone.

343
00:45:07,424 --> 00:45:10,294
If you have to prove where you were
and who you're with, would you be able to?

344
00:45:10,338 --> 00:45:11,817
Sure.

345
00:45:13,992 --> 00:45:16,994
- How long you going to be staying here?
- A few days.

346
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:19,603
If I wanted to come back again
and look around, will that be alright?

347
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:21,126
Sure.

348
00:45:25,345 --> 00:45:28,433
Okay, Mr. Bradley.
Thank you very much.

349
00:45:28,738 --> 00:45:31,000
Listen, if you think of
anything that may help us,

350
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,522
I'd appreciate you
getting in touch with us.

351
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,348
Okay, sure.

352
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:09,495
Are you crazy?
You could have us arrested!

353
00:46:09,798 --> 00:46:13,452
No, no. You can't blame this on me.
I didn't know he would break you.

354
00:46:13,452 --> 00:46:14,757
What?

355
00:46:15,322 --> 00:46:17,541
Wait a minute.
Hold it!

356
00:46:18,149 --> 00:46:20,369
All right, all right.

357
00:46:21,238 --> 00:46:23,848
Okay yes, I was with a girl.

358
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:25,893
Yes, the receptionist.

359
00:46:25,893 --> 00:46:28,285
Yes, I lied.

360
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,461
No, I didn't go to Dr. Kutters.

361
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:37,506
I knew if I told you, you'd get mad.

362
00:46:37,593 --> 00:46:41,594
But I didn't do anything, she just
showed me around, that's all.

363
00:46:41,594 --> 00:46:47,162
I'm not deserting you!
I just want some time for myself.

364
00:46:47,467 --> 00:46:51,120
Look. I've helped you with
everything so far, haven't I?

365
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,861
Killing Lifflander, was your idea.

366
00:46:53,078 --> 00:46:55,862
Coming to New York to get
the other two, was your idea.

367
00:46:55,862 --> 00:46:59,515
Now wait a minute!
Let me finish!

368
00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:02,386
I'm not saying that!

369
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:07,693
Of course you're right.
They deserve what they get.

370
00:47:07,823 --> 00:47:12,303
All I'm saying, it's been your
idea every step of the way.

371
00:47:12,738 --> 00:47:15,130
But I've helped you, haven't I?

372
00:47:16,523 --> 00:47:21,568
Never desert you, not after all
we've been through, you know that.

373
00:47:22,612 --> 00:47:25,048
We'll always be together.

374
00:47:57,062 --> 00:47:59,716
What the hell are you doing here?

375
00:47:59,758 --> 00:48:03,325
Wait, no, don't tell me.
It's the first bar you came in, right?

376
00:48:03,325 --> 00:48:05,196
Hi, Casey!

377
00:48:07,588 --> 00:48:11,590
You really doing New York in style.
First the broad and now this place.

378
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,635
- Aw, you come here often?
- I don't even drink!

379
00:48:14,635 --> 00:48:18,854
That's obvious.  You're not still
upset about this afternoon, are you?

380
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,855
That isn't half of it ...

381
00:48:20,855 --> 00:48:23,813
I'm so messed up
about a lot of things.

382
00:48:23,813 --> 00:48:29,119
And now this girl I have met ...
I don't know what's going on anymore.

383
00:48:30,902 --> 00:48:33,338
Tell you what.
Why don't you and that ...

384
00:48:33,338 --> 00:48:36,340
... picnic basket of yours,
join me at the back table?

385
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,167
I've got some heavy boozing to do

386
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:41,037
and looks like you can use
some good company.  Come on.

387
00:48:56,914 --> 00:49:00,741
Now tell me ...
What do you do in Glens Falls?

388
00:49:00,741 --> 00:49:02,960
- I'm a sorter.
- A sort of what?

389
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,656
No, a letter sorter.
I sort mail.

390
00:49:05,656 --> 00:49:07,744
You're a mailman?

391
00:49:13,703 --> 00:49:15,878
That's great!

392
00:49:17,097 --> 00:49:20,707
There is something else
I've been dying to ask you ...

393
00:49:22,446 --> 00:49:25,100
What's in the basket?

394
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,318
- My brother.
- Your brother!

395
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:34,104
What is it?
A midget?

396
00:49:34,278 --> 00:49:38,018
No, we're twins!
Siamese Twins!

397
00:49:38,149 --> 00:49:41,802
That's funny, you don't look oriental!

398
00:49:43,499 --> 00:49:46,066
So what happened?
So bad it shrink him?

399
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,849
No, he is deformed!

400
00:49:49,937 --> 00:49:54,113
A freak!
He looks like a squashed octopus!

401
00:49:56,243 --> 00:50:00,593
Our mother died giving birth to us.
He was attached to my right side.

402
00:50:00,593 --> 00:50:04,290
They wouldn't let us go to school
or anything.  They kept us hidden.

403
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:09,858
We were the big family secret.
Everyone hated us, except our aunt.

404
00:50:09,988 --> 00:50:11,946
Listen, he likes the dark,

405
00:50:11,946 --> 00:50:15,382
he doesn't like to be seen,
not even by me, sometimes.

406
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:16,470
And you know what else?

407
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,253
He talks to me, up
here, without words.

408
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:21,167
I just hear him
whispering in my brain.

409
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:23,952
Sometimes he talks for
hours, he won't shut up!

410
00:50:23,994 --> 00:50:26,256
I used to be able to
talk to him like that,

411
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,562
but that's when we
were still connected.

412
00:50:28,605 --> 00:50:31,215
Our aunt said it
was our special gift,

413
00:50:31,215 --> 00:50:34,217
but since we have been
separated, I can't do it anymore.

414
00:50:34,217 --> 00:50:38,349
But he can still do it to me,
in fact, he's even better at it now.

415
00:50:38,349 --> 00:50:42,306
- He always knows what I'm thinking.
- Duane, you're giving me the creeps.

416
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:44,221
They didn't want him to live!

417
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:48,570
But he fooled them.  He
didn't die, he just got stronger.

418
00:50:49,745 --> 00:50:52,094
Oh, if you only knew
what it was like.

419
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:54,747
So in the end, I kept
him from everyone.

420
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:57,400
Well, both of us are messed up!

421
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,924
I don't know which
one of us is worse ...

422
00:51:01,576 --> 00:51:02,924
Duane.

423
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,751
Duane!

424
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:11,145
No, no, God no!   I don't
even want it in the house!

425
00:51:11,189 --> 00:51:15,147
It should be dead instead of my wife!
How could you let it be born?

426
00:51:15,147 --> 00:51:18,192
Why didn't kill it
before it killed her?

427
00:51:18,236 --> 00:51:22,542
And then, after they
tell me, my wife died,

428
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:25,760
after they tell me my child
is a twisted block of flesh

429
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,587
then she tells me
I need two names for it.

430
00:51:28,587 --> 00:51:30,849
One for the child and
one for the monster!

431
00:51:30,849 --> 00:51:33,763
As if I had two sons
instead of one freak!

432
00:51:33,763 --> 00:51:35,895
It killed its own mother!

433
00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:42,593
You want a name for it, I will
name him "killer".  A murderer!

434
00:51:47,073 --> 00:51:49,249
The boy is how old now?
Twelve?

435
00:51:49,249 --> 00:51:52,206
You mean "boys".
There are two of them.

436
00:51:52,206 --> 00:51:55,773
Boys ...
Yes, of course.

437
00:51:57,687 --> 00:51:59,514
They're upstairs.

438
00:52:00,862 --> 00:52:03,646
And just how long have you
actually tutored the child?

439
00:52:03,646 --> 00:52:06,865
Children.  I've been with
them since they were born.

440
00:52:06,865 --> 00:52:10,953
As their aunt, I'm sure you're
doing what you think best.

441
00:52:12,606 --> 00:52:14,912
I've got a copy of
your teaching certificate

442
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:16,956
as well as the
school board's report.

443
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,480
However the state does have final say
and I must examine the boy for myself

444
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,524
before any tutoring can
replace proper schooling.

445
00:52:24,524 --> 00:52:27,003
Now you do understand?

446
00:52:27,003 --> 00:52:30,440
Now, if I may be
blunt, can't they ...

447
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:34,180
Couldn't they have an operation?

448
00:52:34,268 --> 00:52:36,877
It's not that simple.

449
00:52:56,581 --> 00:53:00,279
I think we should
discuss this downstairs.

450
00:53:03,977 --> 00:53:06,499
<i> No, no.  I think we're
making a big mistake.</i>

451
00:53:06,499 --> 00:53:08,718
<i>We're rushing things.
We shouldn't even be here.</i>

452
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:09,718
<i>Where is boy now?</i>

453
00:53:09,718 --> 00:53:11,936
<i>He's upstairs, in bed, asleep.
He can't hear us.</i>

454
00:53:11,936 --> 00:53:14,633
<i>We need time to think
this over, talk it over ...</i>

455
00:53:14,633 --> 00:53:18,504
<i>We don't have time.  It must be done
now, while my sister-in-law is away.</i>

456
00:53:18,504 --> 00:53:20,679
<i>I'm not sure.
I've got second thoughts.</i>

457
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:21,766
<i>Bullshit second thoughts.</i>

458
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:24,637
<i>I've had 12 years of
doctors' second thoughts.</i>

459
00:53:24,681 --> 00:53:26,508
<i>I not know ...
I just don't know.</i>

460
00:53:26,508 --> 00:53:30,117
<i>Well, you'll sure as hell know if it were
your own son we were talking about!</i>

461
00:53:30,117 --> 00:53:34,076
<i> You understand that if we separate the
deformity from Duane, it will probably die?</i>

462
00:53:34,076 --> 00:53:37,078
It's better off dead!  What kind
of life will it have the way it is?

463
00:53:37,078 --> 00:53:39,513
- We're talking about your child!
- Child?

464
00:53:39,513 --> 00:53:42,645
Duane is my child,
not that other thing!

465
00:53:42,688 --> 00:53:44,602
All I want is Duane to be normal.

466
00:53:44,646 --> 00:53:47,560
It's too late to change the
other one, just cut Duane from it.

467
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:49,561
I don't know.
I don't know!

468
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:52,953
The hospital says no, every
doctor I've asked says no ...

469
00:53:52,953 --> 00:53:55,433
You two may be my last hope!

470
00:53:55,476 --> 00:53:59,261
I don't know who you are, or where
Lifflander found you and I don't care.

471
00:53:59,261 --> 00:54:01,827
No questions asked.
Just separate them.

472
00:54:01,827 --> 00:54:05,350
He's right of course.  The boy
should have a chance of a normal life.

473
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:08,612
They don't share organs or
bones, just tissue and flesh.

474
00:54:08,656 --> 00:54:12,788
If the operation is successful, the
most Duane will have is a nasty scar.

475
00:54:12,788 --> 00:54:14,745
- And the other one?
- Doctor ...

476
00:54:14,745 --> 00:54:17,617
I'm not even sure it's human.

477
00:54:20,095 --> 00:54:23,097
No, God no!
Help help!  No!

478
00:54:23,097 --> 00:54:25,315
Stop fighting, God damn it!

479
00:54:25,663 --> 00:54:28,142
We're just going into the
dining room, Duane.  Now stop it!

480
00:54:28,142 --> 00:54:31,536
It won't hurt, Duane.
I promise, this won't hurt!

481
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:35,754
Duane, hold still!

482
00:54:36,538 --> 00:54:38,147
Don't fight it ...

483
00:54:38,147 --> 00:54:40,496
- We're only trying to help you.
- This is for your own good.

484
00:54:40,539 --> 00:54:43,410
- Now, we've got to hold you still.
- Duane, God dammit!

485
00:54:43,454 --> 00:54:45,716
- Hold his arms.
- No, help!  God, no!

486
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,804
Damn it!
It's for your own good!

487
00:54:47,847 --> 00:54:50,327
No, God!
No, help!

488
00:54:50,674 --> 00:54:53,675
Hold him, hold him, that's it.

489
00:54:57,025 --> 00:54:58,939
Damn it!  If it is squirming around,

490
00:54:58,982 --> 00:55:00,243
this is not going to work,
if it's squirming around.

491
00:55:00,243 --> 00:55:03,331
- Hold him still!
- Hold him.  Hold him ...

492
00:55:05,246 --> 00:55:08,290
- Look, I've got it ...
- Okay, hold him.

493
00:56:56,076 --> 00:56:58,294
Is that you, Belial?

494
00:56:59,164 --> 00:57:00,904
Where?

495
00:57:01,817 --> 00:57:03,470
I'm coming.

496
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:35,883
God damn it, Duane!   If that's you
down there, you'd better answer me!

497
00:59:47,801 --> 00:59:49,280
Duane?

498
01:01:32,673 --> 01:01:34,978
It's all right now.

499
01:01:35,978 --> 01:01:39,197
Everyone's gone,
the police have left.

500
01:01:40,459 --> 01:01:43,807
They could find no evidence
of who killed your father,

501
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,722
nor do they have
any idea what killed him.

502
01:01:46,766 --> 01:01:51,507
Dr. Lifflander said that he performed
an emergency operation on your brother

503
01:01:51,551 --> 01:01:56,118
and that he died and was
removed from your side.

504
01:01:57,901 --> 01:02:00,815
I am not going to ask
you what really happened.

505
01:02:00,859 --> 01:02:03,860
I know that you and your
brother have gone through hell.

506
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:08,427
Everyone thinks Belial is dead now
and we'll let them.  It's safer that way.

507
01:02:08,427 --> 01:02:12,516
But I'm here now to
care of you.  Both of you.

508
01:02:26,348 --> 01:02:29,262
- Aren't thou afraid?
- No, monster.  Not I.

509
01:02:29,262 --> 01:02:32,046
Be not afraid.
The isle is full of noises,

510
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:35,134
sounds, and sweet airs
that give delight and hurt not.

511
01:02:35,308 --> 01:02:39,528
Sometimes a thousand twangling
instruments will hum about mine ears,

512
01:02:39,528 --> 01:02:40,920
and sometimes voices,

513
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,226
that if I then had waked after long
sleep, will make me sleep again.

514
01:02:45,312 --> 01:02:46,617
And then in dreaming,

515
01:02:46,617 --> 01:02:50,793
the clouds we thought would open and
show riches ready to drop upon me.

516
01:02:50,837 --> 01:02:55,230
That when I awake,
I cried to dream again.

517
01:03:35,377 --> 01:03:36,987
Hey, that's your room.

518
01:03:36,987 --> 01:03:40,162
- Yeah, but you're going home first.
- No, you first.

519
01:03:40,162 --> 01:03:41,684
All right.

520
01:03:44,686 --> 01:03:46,121
Now, yours.

521
01:03:46,121 --> 01:03:48,644
- I'm okay, really.
- Yeah, I know.  Give me your key.

522
01:03:48,644 --> 01:03:51,124
I can do it myself.

523
01:03:53,124 --> 01:03:54,646
I'm fine.

524
01:03:55,169 --> 01:03:57,952
- Really, I'm really okay ...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

525
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:03,955
See?
I'm all right.

526
01:04:03,999 --> 01:04:05,825
Are you sure?

527
01:04:05,869 --> 01:04:09,914
- A hundred percent.
- Okay, baby.

528
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:10,679
Almost forgot him.

529
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,235
Help!

530
01:08:18,542 --> 01:08:20,412
Help!

531
01:08:23,544 --> 01:08:26,459
There's something in my room!

532
01:08:26,503 --> 01:08:29,982
- Move out!
- I saw it, I saw it!

533
01:08:29,982 --> 01:08:32,157
He tried to kill me!

534
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:36,028
Just head ...
There's nothing else!

535
01:08:37,768 --> 01:08:39,900
That thing is in my room!

536
01:09:02,778 --> 01:09:05,128
I want you to stay with me tonight.

537
01:09:05,128 --> 01:09:08,128
You can sleep on my couch.
Are you okay, honey?

538
01:09:25,397 --> 01:09:28,660
- Whatever was in there, is gone.
- No!

539
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:31,704
It's alright, you can
stay with me tonight.

540
01:09:34,184 --> 01:09:37,794
All right!   Get back to
your rooms!  Come on!

541
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:41,013
This ain't a God
damned subway station!

542
01:09:44,275 --> 01:09:46,450
Move it!
Come on!

543
01:09:46,797 --> 01:09:48,364
Clear the hallway!

544
01:10:25,292 --> 01:10:28,729
This isn't a hotel, it's a nuthouse!

545
01:11:04,613 --> 01:11:07,658
Come on, let's get this over with.

546
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:26,493
This is a vet.
An animal doctor!

547
01:11:38,411 --> 01:11:40,064
Mr. White?

548
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:49,894
It's the last door at
the end of the hall.

549
01:11:53,635 --> 01:11:54,983
So.

550
01:11:54,983 --> 01:11:58,289
Tell me about your cat.   You
said on the phone he's badly cut.

551
01:11:58,332 --> 01:12:00,420
- Yes, on his side.
- Okay.

552
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,638
Let's take him into the next room.

553
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:10,903
Just sit him there on the table.

554
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:18,733
Well then.
Let's take a look at him.

555
01:12:18,733 --> 01:12:21,038
- Only it's not a cat.
- I thought you said ...

556
01:12:21,038 --> 01:12:24,560
And I think I should explain how
he got his cut before you see him.

557
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,866
Another vet, Dr. Lifflander,

558
01:12:27,866 --> 01:12:31,433
operated on him
upstate unsuccessfully.

559
01:12:31,433 --> 01:12:33,608
Dr. Lifflander?

560
01:12:33,652 --> 01:12:36,175
Yes, you know him?

561
01:12:36,348 --> 01:12:39,176
Ahh yes, I see.

562
01:12:39,176 --> 01:12:41,568
I'm beginning to understand now.

563
01:12:41,568 --> 01:12:45,309
You're that kid Needleman
warned me about.  The Bradley boy.

564
01:12:45,309 --> 01:12:47,658
The freak we separated.

565
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:50,616
What a pleasant surprise
after all these years!

566
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:54,139
You seem to have gone through
a great deal of trouble to find me.

567
01:12:54,139 --> 01:12:55,835
The question is, why?

568
01:12:55,835 --> 01:12:57,836
I would assume it's to thank me?

569
01:12:57,836 --> 01:12:59,141
To thank you?

570
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:02,099
Well, after all I made
you normal, didn't I?

571
01:13:02,099 --> 01:13:04,317
You did it to kill my brother!

572
01:13:04,317 --> 01:13:07,449
Oh, dear ...
Hostility?

573
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:10,841
You've got two seconds to
haul your ass out of my office!

574
01:13:10,841 --> 01:13:14,670
I'm not going to be threatened by some
adolescent punk with a smoldering grudge,

575
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:17,932
unless you've got something
else you want to cut off.

576
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:20,672
What's in the basket?

577
01:14:11,824 --> 01:14:13,086
Doctor?

578
01:14:13,172 --> 01:14:15,086
Dr. Kutter, are you all right?

579
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:16,653
Open the door!

580
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:18,480
Dr. Kutter!

581
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:49,972
Doctor?

582
01:14:49,972 --> 01:14:52,929
Dr. Kutter!
Are you all right in there?

583
01:14:52,972 --> 01:14:55,452
Dr. Kutter!
Open the door!

584
01:14:55,582 --> 01:14:57,061
Dr. Kutter!

585
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:27,335
Duane!

586
01:15:28,944 --> 01:15:30,554
Duane!

587
01:15:34,468 --> 01:15:36,644
Oh, God, Duane!
Something awful has happened!

588
01:15:36,686 --> 01:15:37,905
What?
Tell me.

589
01:15:37,905 --> 01:15:39,645
I've been with the
police all morning.

590
01:15:39,645 --> 01:15:42,603
- The police?
- Dr. Needleman's been murdered.

591
01:15:42,603 --> 01:15:45,082
They found his body
some time last night.

592
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:48,388
- They don't think that you ...?
- Oh, no!  Of course not!

593
01:15:48,388 --> 01:15:51,694
It's so awful!
I'm still shaky ... I

594
01:15:51,694 --> 01:15:56,216
I mean ... I didn't like the man,
but God, Duane, someone killing him.

595
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,740
I am a wreck ... I

596
01:15:59,697 --> 01:16:04,263
I need to be with someone.
I don't want to be alone.

597
01:16:06,351 --> 01:16:09,092
I want to be with you, Duane.

598
01:16:14,572 --> 01:16:16,139
I don't know why.

599
01:16:16,139 --> 01:16:19,662
Especially after the way you
acted yesterday, but I just ...

600
01:16:19,662 --> 01:16:22,272
You are the first
person I thought of.

601
01:16:22,315 --> 01:16:25,490
The only person I thought of!

602
01:16:27,361 --> 01:16:29,319
Please don't cry.

603
01:16:29,449 --> 01:16:31,493
It's alright, really.

604
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,538
Come on upstairs.

605
01:16:42,846 --> 01:16:44,890
Well Duane, it was awful!

606
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:47,238
They wanted me to identify the body,

607
01:16:47,238 --> 01:16:49,631
even though they saw
how bad I was taking it.

608
01:16:49,675 --> 01:16:52,720
I don't understand why
I'm just upset.  I just am.

609
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,547
And don't know why
I've been thinking of you.

610
01:16:55,547 --> 01:16:57,635
But it's all I did.

611
01:16:57,635 --> 01:17:01,027
I've been thinking of you all day.

612
01:17:01,462 --> 01:17:03,464
Oh, God, Duane!

613
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,972
Take me, Duane.

614
01:18:13,319 --> 01:18:14,581
Oh, God!
What's that?

615
01:18:14,667 --> 01:18:16,929
Duane, let me up.
Let me up.

616
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:20,322
Duane, let me up!
Let me up!

617
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:21,801
Duane!

618
01:18:21,845 --> 01:18:24,976
Duane, let me up!

619
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:27,543
Duane, let go!

620
01:18:51,292 --> 01:18:55,338
Duane, open up!
What's happening in there?

621
01:18:55,338 --> 01:18:56,338
Duane!

622
01:18:56,338 --> 01:18:58,034
Duane, open up!

623
01:18:58,338 --> 01:19:01,253
What are you trying to do to me?

624
01:19:01,253 --> 01:19:04,429
<i>Let me in!
Are you alright?</i>

625
01:19:04,429 --> 01:19:07,256
- Go away!
- Duane, let me in!

626
01:19:08,126 --> 01:19:09,995
Duane, let me in!

627
01:19:10,039 --> 01:19:11,866
It'll never work!

628
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:15,041
Damn you!

629
01:19:15,259 --> 01:19:17,391
Duane, talk to me, please.

630
01:19:17,391 --> 01:19:20,609
Damn you!

631
01:19:23,915 --> 01:19:26,220
Why?

632
01:19:39,356 --> 01:19:42,183
Duane!

633
01:27:09,897 --> 01:27:11,767
No, never again!

634
01:27:11,767 --> 01:27:15,030
She was good!
She was pure!

635
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:17,075
She wasn't one of them!

636
01:27:17,161 --> 01:27:18,684
Why her?

637
01:27:18,684 --> 01:27:22,120
Because I loved her?
Because she loved me?

638
01:27:22,164 --> 01:27:24,208
What's wrong with you?

639
01:27:24,252 --> 01:27:27,991
No!  I'll never let you out!
No way!

640
01:27:27,991 --> 01:27:30,646
No, I won't have it!
No!

641
01:27:30,732 --> 01:27:33,951
Just because you can't
doesn't mean I shouldn't!

642
01:27:33,951 --> 01:27:37,256
No!  God damn you!
Damn you to hell!

643
01:27:37,344 --> 01:27:40,737
Is this what I have to worry
about every time I find a girl I like?

644
01:27:40,737 --> 01:27:42,520
You climbing on top of her.

645
01:27:42,564 --> 01:27:47,218
If I ever get my hands on you, I'll
kill you!  I swear to God, I'll kill you!

646
01:27:47,218 --> 01:27:50,306
The first girl I ever kissed
and you destroy her!

647
01:27:50,393 --> 01:27:52,306
Why did you do that to me?

648
01:27:54,351 --> 01:27:55,047
Damn you!

649
01:27:56,352 --> 01:27:57,874
Duane, what's the matter?

650
01:27:57,918 --> 01:27:59,483
Get out of here!

651
01:28:17,404 --> 01:28:19,927
No ... !

652
01:28:23,537 --> 01:28:25,712
Jesus Christ!

653
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:42,067
.... bulging biceps.

654
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:51,158
Oh! What's that?

655
01:28:51,158 --> 01:28:54,769
Oh girls, look at that!
What is that?  Oh, no!

656
01:28:58,857 --> 01:29:01,075
- Hey, there's a guy up there!
- No!

657
01:29:03,772 --> 01:29:06,164
Hey!
Are you okay up there?

658
01:29:18,344 --> 01:29:21,258
Hang on, he's going to
fall on one of you people!

659
01:29:32,871 --> 01:29:34,524
Oh, no!

660
01:29:39,744 --> 01:29:41,745
Don't touch him.
