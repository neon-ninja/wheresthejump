1
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,958
It's been 4 weeks since
I asked for a nanny.

2
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,500
If you tell me you're still
looking, how should I respond?

3
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:30,750
I told you many times, I
don't care about paying more.

4
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,833
I said it's urgent for work.

5
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,333
Please look for a nanny properly.

6
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,500
Ina, our new home is

7
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,917
really quiet and has clean air too.

8
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,000
The doctor said it'd be good for you.

9
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:07,250
Once you live there,
you'll grow to love it.

10
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,458
Sweetie.

11
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,667
That doll there,

12
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,000
it's a limited edition.

13
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,292
It was really hard getting it.

14
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,083
You should be thanking me.

15
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:44,250
WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY KIM KWANG-BIN

16
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,792
Ina!

17
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,083
Yeon Ina!

18
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,375
Ina!

19
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,417
Sweetie!

20
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,542
You can't run off like that, I
looked everywhere for you.

21
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,708
Ina, that's our new home.

22
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,625
Do you like it?

23
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,042
<i>You should've come early.</i>

24
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,500
<i>You missed Ina getting the award.</i>

25
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,250
You know about my new project.

26
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,208
It's a state of emergency.

27
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,625
Do you even know what
your birthday gift to her was?

28
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,875
It's this necklace.

29
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,667
She wears it everyday
since I told her it's from you.

30
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:55,792
Honey!

31
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,500
<i>Panic attack isn't something
that gets better with some rest.</i>

32
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,583
<i>It needs constant care.</i>

33
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:24,042
Or you'll have seizures again.

34
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,833
Set an alarm and medicate regularly.

35
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:33,583
I can take care of myself,
but Ina's not getting better.

36
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,375
<i>Is she in bad shape?</i>

37
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,333
She won't even lock eyes with me.

38
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,542
<i>She'll get better in clean air environment.
Architect of the Year</i>

39
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,250
<i>You moved there for that reason.</i>

40
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,208
It's just frustrating, I'm
doing everything possible.

41
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,208
<i>The last resort would be
the art camp I mentioned,</i>

42
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,583
<i>but you two will be apart,
so I don't recommend it.</i>

43
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,542
<i>You're in treatment too,
that's what worries me.</i>

44
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,500
I'm more concerned with her.

45
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,125
<i>Dad, watch me run!</i>

46
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,708
<i>Okay, my little star, do your best!</i>

47
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,167
Yeah, listen to me.

48
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,250
Wasn't I supposed to handle
everything from concept to finish?

49
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,333
<i>But you're never here.</i>

50
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,250
I'm not saying I won't go!

51
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:29,708
It's because of the kid!

52
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,583
Listen, this is a unilateral
contract termination.

53
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,833
Am I wrong?

54
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,042
Let's talk face-to-face,
I'll come to the site.

55
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,792
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

56
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:46,292
<i>My lovely Ina,</i>

57
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,167
<i>happy birthday to you!</i>

58
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,375
<i>Blow out the candles,</i>

59
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:53,958
<i>or I will.</i>

60
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,208
<i>No way!</i>

61
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,708
<i>- What was your wish?
- Secret!</i>

62
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,500
<i>- You won't tell me?
- Nope!</i>

63
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,750
Ina!

64
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,542
What happened, sweetie?

65
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,167
Did you scream just now?

66
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,500
I didn't scream.

67
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,750
Is everything okay?

68
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:16,792
Yup.

69
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,167
Can I come in for a bit?

70
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:24,917
Yup.

71
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,375
That's weird.

72
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,833
You really didn't scream?

73
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,000
Nope.

74
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,833
Where did you get that doll?

75
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,000
It was in here.

76
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:51,917
- In there?
- Yup.

77
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,083
Hold on.

78
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:06,625
You know that doll I
bought you recently?

79
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,583
I think it'd be more
fun to play with that.

80
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,625
Dad, can I keep this?

81
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,875
Someone else
played with it, it's dirty.

82
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,292
Give it to me, I'll throw it out.

83
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:19,917
I want to play with both dolls.

84
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,875
Are you really okay?

85
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:28,417
Yup.

86
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,125
All right.

87
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,750
Sleep early.

88
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,208
Okay.

89
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,417
Thank you for the meal.

90
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,250
Dad, can I play in my room?

91
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:21,250
You want to?

92
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,083
I like this house.

93
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:40,917
I got a friend too.

94
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,375
That's great, Ina, thank you.

95
00:14:58,167 --> 00:14:59,875
<i>Why is Hyun-sang in the conversation?</i>

96
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,917
If we share the design, the
concept will get tangled up.

97
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,125
What does he know about galleries?

98
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,875
He hasn't even done a 2-floor cabin.

99
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,333
While you were on leave,
he did a gallery in Jeju.

100
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:17,042
He's doing well, like
you in your prime.

101
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,667
Honestly,

102
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,208
they just wanted him,
but I championed you.

103
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,667
What a load of crap...

104
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,875
The boss is asking,

105
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:31,000
how an architect designs
when he's not even on site.

106
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:32,958
It's all been agreed to!

107
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,458
I'd come down as
soon as I find a nanny!

108
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,875
It's been over a month now.

109
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,542
We're out of time.

110
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,708
Why is he here?

111
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,125
Yeah, that's odd.

112
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,292
Why is Hyun-sang
here? Out on a stroll?

113
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
So it's already been decided.

114
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,500
No way, dude.

115
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,375
I'll come down, so get rid of him.

116
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,750
What?

117
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,542
I'll report to the site!

118
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,208
<i>Stop moving!</i>

119
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,875
<i>Don't fool around!</i>

120
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:53,958
<i>Hold on!</i>

121
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,292
Ina, what were you doing?

122
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,792
I was making a song for you.

123
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,292
Wanna hear it?

124
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,708
Ina.

125
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,417
I have to tell you something.

126
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,208
Remember how I said I was designing
a museum in Tongyeong?

127
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,292
That job is starting,

128
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,083
so I need to work at
the site for a little while.

129
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:30,000
A nanny will stay here with you.

130
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,500
How long?

131
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:34,042
About 2 months?

132
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,458
But I'll come home
every weekend to see you.

133
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,417
Can I come with you?

134
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,333
I really want you to come with me,

135
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,750
but it's a construction
site, so it's bad for you.

136
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,917
If you're understanding
and help me out,

137
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,125
I'll buy you a present.

138
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,833
You were gonna do whatever you want.

139
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,125
Why bother asking?

140
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,000
Honey.

141
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,708
I'm not doing whatever I want,

142
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,417
I want to find a way together.

143
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:17,708
But if you always give
me an attitude like this,

144
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,042
I don't know what to do.

145
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:26,250
Could you try to understand
and think in my shoes?

146
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,750
I'll think about what you want.

147
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,917
Ina, let's talk again.

148
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,625
Ina, it's late, get to bed!

149
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:08,417
<i>Decide if you'll come
or not by tomorrow.</i>

150
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,708
<i>How is the art camp treatment done?</i>

151
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:20,292
<i>They'll start with
isolation treatment.</i>

152
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:22,625
<i>Will she be okay?</i>

153
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,792
<i>Being away from me,
since her mom's gone too.</i>

154
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,167
<i>It won't be easy, but what can you do?</i>

155
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,583
<i>It's too much for you.</i>

156
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,833
<i>They take only a few kids,
so you'll need to donate.</i>

157
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:35,792
<i>Think about it.</i>

158
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,500
Where are you going?

159
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:45,917
Ina, I'm going to the site for a bit.

160
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,042
I'll be right back.

161
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,458
You said we'll talk again.

162
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,625
Can't think of what to buy me?

163
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:54,375
Ina.

164
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,083
Let's talk tonight.

165
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:01,083
And that doll in New
York, I ordered it.

166
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,500
It'll arrive soon.

167
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,500
Do you know how old I am? I
don't need those dumb dolls.

168
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,292
Ina.

169
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:14,042
You said you liked that doll.

170
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,292
And why are you talking
like that to your dad?

171
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,375
Why do you decide what I like?

172
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,458
Then tell me what you really like!

173
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:26,625
I don't need anything.

174
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,167
- Calls himself 'dad'...
- What?

175
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,792
- Ina.
- Let go.

176
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:36,792
Let go! Let go!

177
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,167
Let go!

178
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:40,333
Let go! Let go!

179
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:41,667
Let go! Let go!

180
00:24:57,792 --> 00:24:59,792
D'you ask for a nanny?

181
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,125
Yes, hello, I was just heading out.

182
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:07,167
$150 for a day.

183
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,292
Okay.

184
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,875
Do-hyun, that donation
to the art camp,

185
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:24,708
<i>how much would be enough?</i>

186
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:36,042
They're pretty well off.

187
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,625
The kid's in her room, doing whatever.

188
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,375
No wife.

189
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,917
Who knows, maybe she ran off.

190
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:51,667
He stashed all the expensive stuff.

191
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,875
It's so my style.

192
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:14,292
Hey.

193
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:15,625
This is Mr. Park.

194
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,333
- Good work.
- It's so nice to meet you.

195
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,708
- This is Mr. Kim.
- Great to meet you.

196
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,792
Good to meet you, sir.

197
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,125
- Shall we go inside and talk?
- Sure.

198
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:27,542
She's screaming and
smashing shit in her room.

199
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:30,500
She doesn't eat no matter what I make.

200
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:33,708
She'll wise up when she starves.

201
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:52,875
Crazy little bitch!

202
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:57,625
She started today, how
could she just leave?

203
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:02,208
Stop giving me a load of shit.

204
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,875
I'll head home tonight,
so keep her there till then.

205
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:09,583
If she took the money,
she must be responsible!

206
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,417
I can't go right now!

207
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:17,042
Okay.

208
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:22,458
<i>Talked to art camp
director, send her next week.</i>

209
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,417
I want to go too,

210
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,542
take me with you.

211
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,958
<i>Come with us...</i>

212
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,208
<i>We'll take you with us...</i>

213
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:02,750
<i>Missing Child: Yeon Ina, female (11)</i>

214
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:07,958
Thank you all.

215
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:24,917
She's not my daughter.

216
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:30,542
She's been missing for a
month, and you got nothing?

217
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,125
It's killing us too.

218
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:34,708
Nothing comes up at all.

219
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,958
That nanny I hired,

220
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,750
Ina disappeared
shortly after she left.

221
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:41,708
Let's investigate her once more.

222
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:44,917
We checked the dash cam
from the car she drove that day,

223
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:47,583
and we even did a lie detector test.

224
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:49,125
She's clean.

225
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:50,875
Please go home and wait.

226
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:53,292
You've been telling me to
go home and wait for a month!

227
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,875
Are you investigating properly?!

228
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:57,667
Why the hell are you
lashing out at me?!

229
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:03,500
- All done.
- Okay.

230
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:10,667
All right, Mr. Yeon,

231
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,208
please look at the camera.

232
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:17,250
You can speak freely about Ina.

233
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,875
Hello, I'm Yeon Sang-won.

234
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:31,250
This is my daughter, Ina.

235
00:30:32,292 --> 00:30:33,750
She's 11 years old,

236
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,375
and she disappeared about a month ago.

237
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:45,792
I really want to find
her, please help.

238
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,917
<i>We scoured all security cams,</i>

239
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:56,833
<i>and dash cams in 3km vicinity,</i>

240
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:59,125
<i>but we did not see any traces of her.</i>

241
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:04,042
<i>Her mother died in a
car accident last year,</i>

242
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:05,583
<i>and she lived with her dad.</i>

243
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:10,208
<i>According to people around
them, they weren't in good terms.</i>

244
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:16,875
<i>While filming, we stumbled
upon a dozen pill containers.</i>

245
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,083
<i>They're all used to
treat mental illnesses.</i>

246
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:24,167
<i>The medication shows his
illnesses must be serious,</i>

247
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:26,833
<i>and he may be experiencing
overlapping symptoms.</i>

248
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:31,083
<i>He was so fixated on work,
to the point that I felt bad.</i>

249
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:35,333
<i>Maybe because he took some time off,</i>

250
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:37,125
<i>he looked nervous and anxious.</i>

251
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:40,583
<i>Unfortunately, many of
the missing child cases</i>

252
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
<i>are linked to family members.</i>

253
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:48,917
<i>Remember the Mi-jin case
we introduced 3 years ago?</i>

254
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:55,583
<i>There are many similarities
between these two cases.</i>

255
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,208
<i>Perhaps this is the point</i>

256
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,542
<i>where we need to look at
the case from another angle.</i>

257
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:07,250
<i>A girl who disappeared
from inside her home,</i>

258
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:10,667
<i>where could she be now?</i>

259
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:13,208
<i>We're waiting for your tips.</i>

260
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:18,458
Is this <i>Behind the Story</i>?

261
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,583
<i>Her dad is suspicious.</i>

262
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:29,750
Man...

263
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,292
<i>There is no Internet connection.</i>

264
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:48,625
<i>Tada!</i>

265
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:51,000
<i>This is a gift from dad.</i>

266
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:52,542
<i>A butterfly necklace!</i>

267
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:55,542
<i>It's so pretty!</i>

268
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:57,917
<i>You love it that much?</i>

269
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:00,083
<i>Do you want to thank dad?</i>

270
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:02,250
<i>Thank you, dad!</i>

271
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,458
Who are you?

272
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,042
Hello, you called for
an internet technician?

273
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,667
The door was open.

274
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:40,417
This house is so big,

275
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:42,792
I'll need to look around
to find the problem.

276
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,250
This house is humungous.

277
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:50,417
Are you an artist?

278
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:53,292
Or are you making a house?

279
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,917
I've always wanted to
live in a big house like this.

280
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:59,875
But my family was poor.

281
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,792
It's not here.

282
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,333
How do you clean a house like this?

283
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:05,958
You'll tire yourself
out doing it alone.

284
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,667
Do you get a maid?

285
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,083
Really high ceiling too.

286
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,333
Do you get really high heating bills?

287
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,875
I'm sure you get government
subsidies for solar panels,

288
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:19,958
but you can't tell how
efficient those panels are, right?

289
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:23,375
How much is it per square foot?

290
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:24,750
Higher than Gangnam?

291
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:28,125
You can ask the real estate agency.

292
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,625
Could you just get
to fixing the internet?

293
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:34,833
There are cable problems
out here in the country.

294
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:37,708
So the EMF...

295
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:51,750
So I'm using an EMF
detector to check the condition.

296
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,833
Is this how you fix the internet?

297
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:58,958
May I?

298
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Sure.

299
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:17,125
Excuse me?

300
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:18,667
Could I get your business card?

301
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:20,792
Wait a minute, that's not important,

302
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:23,125
I'm about to solve the problem.

303
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:45,000
I checked the terminal
box just in case,

304
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:47,083
and someone had cut the cable.

305
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,750
What did you say?

306
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,792
Didn't you call for an
internet technician?

307
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:57,333
Sir, could we be civil
and talk about this?

308
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:58,750
Listen to me, will you?

309
00:36:58,792 --> 00:36:59,292
Wait a minute!

310
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,542
Who the hell are you?

311
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:04,583
Don't take it the wrong way.

312
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:07,667
I needed to check something,
I'm here to help you.

313
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:10,333
Are you from the TV show?
I'm not getting fooled twice.

314
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:12,583
I'm calling the cops.

315
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:17,417
Didn't Ina's personality
change before she disappeared?

316
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,583
Acting weird, talking to herself
or screaming in front of the closet.

317
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:25,292
How did you know that?

318
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,542
Ina isn't the first child to
disappear in her house.

319
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,667
32 kids have disappeared since 1998,

320
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,208
and I've been at it for 10 years.

321
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:37,583
If you Google 'Exorcist
Heo', you'll find me.

322
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:41,893
I've been blogged many times
and went on TV shows too.

323
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:43,309
<i>Exorcism at your service
Exorcist Heo Kyung-hoon</i>

324
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:46,375
When it comes to exorcism,
I'm pretty much No.1 in Korea.

325
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:49,625
Top class fame and skills
but with reasonable rates,

326
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,667
like this.

327
00:37:57,917 --> 00:37:59,583
Take a look at this first.

328
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,000
They all disappeared from their homes.

329
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:09,167
Playing, doing homework, sleeping,

330
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,625
they all vanished without a trace.

331
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,667
They drew those drawings.

332
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
They all point to a child.

333
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:28,333
A girl named Hyun-soo disappeared
like Ina 20 years ago.

334
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:33,583
Her parents set up this ritual
to find out if she was dead.

335
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,833
You saw her, right? That's my mom.

336
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:16,375
A few parents of the
missing kids said so,

337
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:18,083
that they saw her.

338
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:23,167
I think she was trying to warn them,

339
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:25,083
trying to stop it
from taking the kids.

340
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:29,833
Shall I continue?

341
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:41,542
She killed my mom, took the children,

342
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,083
and now Ina too.

343
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:45,750
It's her.

344
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:49,167
The source of everything,
a demonic child.

345
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:06,208
How am I supposed to take this in?

346
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,708
Does this make sense to you?

347
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,750
A ghost took my child?

348
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,500
You're just trying to
get paid for a ritual!

349
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:14,875
Are you out of your mind?!

350
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,333
Get out, leave.

351
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:31,417
Don't believe me? Okay.

352
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:36,292
I'm the only one who believe you.

353
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,833
Everyone thinks you killed her.

354
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:43,958
If it's delayed any longer,
she'll be lost forever.

355
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,792
Wait.

356
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,750
Can you really find her?

357
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:06,833
Yes.

358
00:41:12,292 --> 00:41:15,500
Spirit of the living remains
in the underworld for 49 days,

359
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:17,042
so-called '49-day memorial rite'.

360
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:21,917
It's easily explained in the
movie <i>Along with the Gods</i>.

361
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:26,375
You didn't see that movie?

362
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:27,583
Never got to.

363
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:29,333
I thought you were cultured.

364
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:33,417
In any case, Ina has only 3 days left.

365
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:35,083
3 days.

366
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:41,917
This is a detector that finds

367
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,625
objects with wavelengths
beyond quantum mechanics.

368
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:51,667
When ghosts appear,
this reacts to them.

369
00:41:57,667 --> 00:42:00,167
So where exactly is Ina right now?

370
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:03,375
Realm of the dead.

371
00:42:05,917 --> 00:42:07,417
We call it the dark realm.

372
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:11,375
It means...

373
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,250
- Let me take a page...
- Don't tear that.

374
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:17,250
Jeez...

375
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,833
Take a look.

376
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:35,125
Realm of the living is
separated from realm of the dead.

377
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:36,500
They share the side.

378
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:39,250
They're stepping on the same space,

379
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:42,167
but they can't see each
other because of the border.

380
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:46,583
But if the resonance
frequency is in sync,

381
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:49,583
they can see each other.

382
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:51,875
They can cross realms.

383
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:54,083
Like the movie <i>Interstellar</i>.

384
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:59,000
The shaman exorcism is like
scrubbing the radio frequency.

385
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:01,458
It's often called 'possession'.

386
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,750
This happens frequently,
so I need protection.

387
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:15,948
There is a breed of ghosts
that are especially malicious.

388
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,167
Like the demon we're after.

389
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:22,417
They find people who sync up
and drag them to their realm.

390
00:43:23,292 --> 00:43:27,458
The victims lose their memories over
time, and are left with only malice.

391
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,708
They become the Blinded.

392
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,542
Once they lock eyes,
they'll swallow everything,

393
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:35,708
they're horrifying beings.

394
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:48,750
What can I do to find her?

395
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,083
We have to capture the
demon to get her back.

396
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:54,833
Beat it up or negotiate,
whatever it takes.

397
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:03,542
<i>The child demons are
subconsciously drawn to dolls.</i>

398
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:06,917
<i>When they hold the straw
dolls with my blood on them,</i>

399
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:09,625
<i>it'll generate a tingly sensation.</i>

400
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:11,500
<i>It's like a trap.</i>

401
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:28,625
This creates a boundary,

402
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,958
these are all money.

403
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,833
Value of these talismans
shot up lately!

404
00:44:34,042 --> 00:44:38,333
So yeah, these are expensive.

405
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:53,083
Watch carefully, it'll come out soon.

406
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,792
Have you tried this cup noodle?

407
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:31,792
It feels so genuine.

408
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:33,708
It has real fried tofu.

409
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:38,375
Who cares about fried
tofu, does this really work?

410
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:41,083
Yes, of course.

411
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:43,125
Be patient.

412
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:49,750
Did it figure us out?
Why isn't it coming?

413
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,292
I hear something.

414
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:29,125
Huh? It's Ina's violin.

415
00:46:52,917 --> 00:46:54,708
My ears...

416
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,708
She's a bold one.

417
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:16,500
Was Ina here?

418
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:20,417
Not sure about that.

419
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,542
We'll try once more,

420
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:25,000
with a big doll drenched in blood.

421
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:30,375
She's really something.

422
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:51,833
Sir.

423
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:54,208
Which singers does Ina like?

424
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:56,542
BTS? BLACKPINK?

425
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,292
Bands that kids nowadays like.

426
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,208
You don't know? Who's her best friend?

427
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:16,625
You really don't know much about her.

428
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:19,833
You two don't talk?

429
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,750
That's not right.

430
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:27,042
I absolutely hate silence.

431
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,375
I actually hate being talkative,

432
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:32,417
but I talk a lot because
I hate silence more.

433
00:48:33,417 --> 00:48:36,000
So, how should I address you?

434
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,333
Whatever you feel like.

435
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,458
Then...

436
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:43,250
Mr. Yeon?

437
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:47,750
No, since you retained
me how's 'boss'?

438
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:51,458
I'd rather you call me Mr. Yeon.

439
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,167
What should I call you?

440
00:48:53,792 --> 00:48:56,833
General Manager Heo,
GMs work the hardest.

441
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:01,917
I'm thirsty, let me raid your fridge.

442
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:03,833
I could use a beer.

443
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:33,333
GM Heo.

444
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:35,083
GM Heo!

445
00:49:47,542 --> 00:49:48,875
<i>Dad...</i>

446
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:57,875
<i>Dad!</i>

447
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:15,417
<i>Mr. Yeon, close your eyes.</i>

448
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:16,583
<i>Close them now!</i>

449
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:32,792
<i>We didn't set the trap, she did.</i>

450
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,375
The Blinded can only see
those with opened eyes.

451
00:51:37,417 --> 00:51:42,250
So don't open them and
get out of there quietly.

452
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:43,708
Stay still for now.

453
00:51:44,542 --> 00:51:45,875
Completely still.

454
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:54,167
Now, do exactly what I tell you.

455
00:51:56,708 --> 00:52:02,417
<i>Keep your body low,
and turn right slowly.</i>

456
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:31,583
No, left from there!

457
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,792
<i>Mr. Yeon, stop!</i>

458
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:55,083
Don't' move.

459
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:00,458
<i>Don't move and stay right there.</i>

460
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:08,333
You're almost there, just hang on.

461
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:21,167
You're so close, don't move a muscle,

462
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:23,917
I'll be right there, don't move.

463
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:31,750
Goddammit...

464
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:39,250
<i>Mr. Yeon, get out of there.</i>

465
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,708
<i>Just come out!</i>

466
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,833
<i>All the beings in heaven,</i>

467
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:32,667

470
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:44,583

00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:47,750

472
00:54:50,542 --> 00:54:51,542
You're...

473
00:54:53,542 --> 00:54:54,822
<i>Missing Child Cho Myung-jin (11)</i>

474
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:23,167
Heo!

475
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:28,417
Heo!

476
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:41,042
What happened?

477
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:46,083
That was embarrassing...

478
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,917
- It was Myung-jin...
- Myung-jin?

479
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:07,458
<i>In Surgery</i>

480
00:56:19,208 --> 00:56:23,292
<i>Missing Child Cho Myung-jin (11)</i>

481
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:42,375
<i>Chungcheong Province,
Jujin District, near Gyunbaek...</i>

482
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,375
<i>Gyunbaek Real Estate</i>

483
00:56:48,792 --> 00:56:52,542
I'm not sure, got another photo?

484
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,333
That's all.

485
00:56:58,042 --> 00:57:00,000
He looks like an ex-con.

486
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:03,708
Did he steal money from you?

487
00:57:04,542 --> 00:57:06,208
His child went missing.

488
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,875
Is that so?

489
00:57:08,917 --> 00:57:10,708
Sorry for what I said...

490
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:13,000
Wait, a missing child?

491
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:17,125
Could it be that Sangdong man?

492
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:21,750
There's a man who lives
alone in Mt. Sangdong,

493
00:57:22,542 --> 00:57:25,792
he's famous for all the
weird stuff around his house.

494
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:29,042
<i>From what I hear,
his kid went missing.</i>

495
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:55,250
<i>Kyung-hoon...</i>

00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:57,750
<i>It's mom... mom...</i>

00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:00,542
<i>Find mom...</i>

498
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:07,417
- Defibrillator!
- Yes, doctor!

499
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:36,333
Hello?

500
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:40,917
Excuse me!

501
00:58:41,917 --> 00:58:43,417
Is anyone home?

502
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,333
Who are you?

503
00:58:57,292 --> 00:58:59,125
Are you Myung-jin's father?

504
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:01,625
Please leave.

505
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:04,167
I have some questions about her.

506
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,208
Are you a cop?

507
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,333
No, sir.

508
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:31,167
My daughter also disappeared.

509
00:59:31,917 --> 00:59:34,417
I think it's related to
Myung-jin somehow.

510
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:43,125
She disappeared while
sleeping in the next room.

511
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:48,417
My wife went out to look
for her, and never returned.

512
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:53,792
I searched her for 10
years before giving up.

513
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:59,917
And spent another 10
years trying to forget her.

514
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:06,500
I don't want to dig up
the past, please leave me.

515
01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:11,208
Did anything happen
before her disappearance?

516
01:00:12,792 --> 01:00:16,625
This might sound weird, but
did her personality change,

517
01:00:16,667 --> 01:00:19,500
or maybe she talked to
herself in front of the closet?

518
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:23,750
Why do you think I live up here?

519
01:00:27,417 --> 01:00:30,500
It suffocates me to see kids,

520
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:36,250
why do you think I live
in complete isolation?

521
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:38,917
My apologies.

522
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:49,042
Do you know anything about this doll?

523
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,208
Why is this... But how?!

524
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:09,875
Why are you here?

525
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,125
Why did you come?!

526
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:18,042
I'm not gonna die!

527
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:20,417
You won't get me!

528
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:29,417
This can't be here.

529
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:31,958
I have to burn it...

530
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:42,042
<i>Dad...</i>

531
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,917
Myung-jin...

532
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,042
Sir?

533
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:19,542
Hello?

534
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:34,958
Honey...

535
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:37,792
It's okay...

536
01:03:37,917 --> 01:03:39,333
What are you doing?!

537
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:40,833
Just hold on...

538
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,250
You go on ahead and wait for us.

539
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,333
Sir, please...

540
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:50,042
I'll be...

541
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:54,542
right there...

542
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:05,333
Dad! Dad! Please let me out!

543
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:09,458
Dad! I'm really scared!

544
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,917
Mom! Dad!

545
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:20,708
<i>Over 1,000 shops have
closed down or are on sale.</i>

546
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,250
<i>In Seoul alone...</i>

547
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,500
Please let me out, dad!

548
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:27,708
Let me out, dad!

549
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:34,542
Mom! Mom!

550
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:38,125
Please let me out!

551
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:43,208
I'm sorry!

552
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:46,917
Dad!

553
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,750
Myung-jin.

554
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:59,625
Breathing doesn't
prove that we're alive.

555
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:03,375
Dad, please help me...

556
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:07,042
When we are reborn,

557
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:12,417
we'll be happy, with no debts.

558
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:17,417
Dad, I'm really sorry...

559
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:24,375
Please let me out, I'm sorry...

560
01:05:25,792 --> 01:05:28,000
Rather than living like this...

561
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:37,375
we'll be happier dead.

562
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:41,667
I'm scared, dad...

563
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:43,792
Please!

564
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:49,250
Please, I'm sorry!

565
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:50,875
Dad!

566
01:05:51,292 --> 01:05:52,542
Dad!

567
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,750
Dad!

568
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,833
Help me...

569
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,417
I saw Myung-jin's memory.

570
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:13,125
You and Myung-jin's
frequencies must be in sync.

571
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:15,708
Then you can see
each other's memories.

572
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:20,208
Her resentment turned her into a demon,

573
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:23,125
and she's been gathering
other kids in pain.

574
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,917
It all makes sense now.

575
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:33,458
You resented Ina, no?

576
01:07:35,042 --> 01:07:36,458
Be honest for a moment.

577
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:39,250
Work always meant more than her,

578
01:07:39,292 --> 01:07:41,083
and you wanted her to go away.

579
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,292
Get to your point.

580
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:47,042
Kids know everything instinctively,

581
01:07:47,917 --> 01:07:50,375
whether someone
truly loves them or not.

582
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:53,750
Buying her some dolls
can't hide your feelings.

583
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:57,125
All missing kids have
something in common.

584
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:02,625
They're scarred by their parents:

585
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:05,208
assault, verbal abuse,
and abandonment.

586
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:07,833
Same thing with Ina.

587
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,208
How painful would it have
been to live with a dad

588
01:08:12,208 --> 01:08:13,875
who wanted her gone.

589
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,083
Imagine her loneliness.

590
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:25,417
Her sorrow called for Myung-jin.

591
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:32,000
So it was me who sent her away.

592
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:05,042
- Mr. Heo.
- Holy craps...

593
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:07,208
What is it?

594
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:10,000
About that frequency,

595
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:14,917
so you're saying if we're in sync,

596
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:16,917
I can see and enter their realm?

597
01:09:17,292 --> 01:09:19,000
Right, if you're in sync.

598
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:24,417
When I had that panic attack, you
said I was in sync with Myung-jin.

599
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,375
Does that mean I can meet Ina?

600
01:09:28,917 --> 01:09:30,208
What do you want to do?

601
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:33,583
We're running out of time,
let me enter their realm.

602
01:09:35,542 --> 01:09:39,958
No way, it's too dangerous,
you'll get hurt.

603
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,542
I don't care if it's too dangerous,

604
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:49,250
there's no other way,
unless you got a plan.

605
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:53,542
Help me get there.

606
01:09:54,708 --> 01:09:56,292
You have no idea what you're saying.

607
01:09:56,833 --> 01:09:59,458
Once you're there, you
could get stuck and die.

608
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,625
Plus, you'll ruin my exorcism career.

609
01:10:01,667 --> 01:10:03,875
You're asking the impossible,
it's just not doable.

610
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:14,333
Sorry for bringing up money,
but I'll pay you whatever you want.

611
01:10:17,083 --> 01:10:19,958
So help me get there.

612
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,375
I want to see her, please help me.

613
01:10:27,417 --> 01:10:29,125
Jesus...

614
01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:32,750
I'll protect you with a ritual,

615
01:10:33,167 --> 01:10:35,083
but you'll have no
longer than 30 minutes.

616
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:37,917
If you don't come out before
then, remember the Blinded?

617
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,625
You'll turn into that and
stay in the underworld.

618
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:43,500
It's okay, let's try it.

619
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:46,417
All right, let's try it.

620
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:49,875
<i>How to worsen your panic attack?</i>

621
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:51,583
<i>That's a weird question.</i>

622
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:55,000
Could you just trust me? Please.

623
01:11:13,958 --> 01:11:16,750
<i>Cho Myung-jin (11)</i>

624
01:11:28,708 --> 01:11:30,917
<i>If there's a high
intake of caffeine pills,</i>

625
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:33,958
<i>you'll get a panic attack,
and at worse, death,</i>

626
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:36,417
<i>so be absolutely careful.</i>

627
01:11:37,417 --> 01:11:39,167
<i>Remember that I've warned you.</i>

628
01:12:03,167 --> 01:12:04,333
Are you ready?

629
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:07,250
My symptom will start soon.

630
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:10,958
Myung-jin created that realm,
so anything can happen,

631
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,708
she'll do whatever
it takes to stop you,

632
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,167
so be prepared.

633
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:18,750
I'm bringing my daughter back.

634
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:23,292
Stay alive...

635
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:27,500
and pay me for my service, got it?

636
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:30,917
Depends on your performance.

637
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:03,208
This fire is linked to you.

638
01:13:04,167 --> 01:13:06,250
If the time runs out, or if you die,

639
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:08,458
this fire will go out.

640
01:16:43,208 --> 01:16:44,333
Seung-hee...

641
01:16:51,542 --> 01:16:53,083
Wait, honey!

642
01:16:58,625 --> 01:16:59,833
Seung-hee...

643
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,625
Look what you've done to Ina.

644
01:17:12,292 --> 01:17:14,625
Ina is dying.

645
01:17:14,667 --> 01:17:15,833
Die!

646
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:26,333
Ina!

647
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:14,042
Ina!

648
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:28,833
Ina!

649
01:20:45,667 --> 01:20:46,792
Seung-hee...

650
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:48,708
Honey, are you okay?

651
01:20:49,292 --> 01:20:50,333
Baby...

652
01:20:51,333 --> 01:20:52,417
Ina...

653
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:54,125
Ina?

654
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:57,958
Protect her no matter what, okay?

655
01:21:01,167 --> 01:21:03,167
Seung-hee! Honey!

656
01:21:04,417 --> 01:21:05,583
Sweetheart...

657
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:08,708
No! Seung-hee!

658
01:21:17,792 --> 01:21:18,792
Ina...

659
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,000
Ina!

660
01:21:22,917 --> 01:21:24,542
Why are you here?

661
01:21:33,667 --> 01:21:37,583
Myung-jin, I came to get Ina.

662
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:40,917
Why? This is what you wanted.

663
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:43,958
You wanted to throw her away.

664
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:51,292
That donation to the art camp,
how much would be enough?

665
01:21:52,292 --> 01:21:56,083
Back then, I...

666
01:21:56,125 --> 01:21:58,583
Ina will soon live with us here.

667
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:06,167
Myung-jin!

668
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:07,542
Please let her go...

669
01:22:08,208 --> 01:22:10,042
Please let me take her back.

670
01:22:23,875 --> 01:22:24,917
Myung-jin,

671
01:22:25,667 --> 01:22:27,667
what happened to you that day...

672
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:30,458
I saw it all.

673
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:37,000
That's why you brought
other kids here, Ina too.

674
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:43,000
The last thing you heard that day...

675
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:44,208
I don't want to hear it!

676
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:46,875
Rather than living like this...

677
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:50,125
We'll be happier dead.

678
01:22:51,208 --> 01:22:52,542
Do you trust me?

679
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:03,375
Mom!

680
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:08,542
Mom...

681
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:14,333
I want to live...

682
01:23:17,542 --> 01:23:19,458
It's all grown-ups' fault.

683
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:21,917
It's my fault.

684
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:28,292
It's all my fault...

685
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:30,125
Don't lie to me!

686
01:23:38,958 --> 01:23:39,958
It's mom...

687
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:42,625
<i>Don't forget, find mom!</i>

688
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:44,458
Mom...

689
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:01,417
Ina, honey!

690
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:07,125
Kill him.

691
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,667
Ina, please snap out of it.

692
01:24:19,917 --> 01:24:21,625
Everything belongs somewhere,

693
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:24,875
you will find out where god is.

694
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,917
Ina, please...

695
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Ina!

696
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:48,833
<i>Myung-jin?</i>

697
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:15,125
Here you were, my baby.

698
01:25:17,292 --> 01:25:18,375
Mom?

699
01:25:18,958 --> 01:25:21,208
How scared must you have been?

700
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:28,500
How painful...

701
01:25:33,333 --> 01:25:35,458
I should've protected you...

702
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:38,875
I'm so sorry, sweetheart...

703
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,542
I only waited for you.

704
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:50,333
- Mom...
- Myung-jin.

705
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:58,042
You can rest with me now.

706
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:04,875
Ina.

707
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:07,667
Ina...

708
01:26:13,792 --> 01:26:14,875
Myung-jin...

709
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:19,083
Mom!

710
01:26:21,792 --> 01:26:23,083
Mom...

711
01:26:25,083 --> 01:26:26,417
Mom!

712
01:26:36,417 --> 01:26:37,625
Mom!

713
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:45,167
Mom...

714
01:26:46,458 --> 01:26:50,750
Mom! Mom!

715
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:56,958
Mom! Mom!

716
01:26:57,125 --> 01:27:01,542
Mom! Mom!

717
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,833
Mom!

718
01:27:07,375 --> 01:27:08,542
Myung-jin.

719
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:25,500
Mr. Yeon, hurry, there's no time.

720
01:27:42,417 --> 01:27:43,583
Myung-jin.

721
01:27:50,167 --> 01:27:51,500
I'm really sorry.

722
01:27:59,167 --> 01:28:00,583
I'm so sorry.

723
01:29:26,667 --> 01:29:27,875
Ina!

724
01:29:39,542 --> 01:29:40,792
Ina, wake up...

725
01:29:43,125 --> 01:29:44,458
Ina...

726
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:03,000
Dad...

727
01:30:04,917 --> 01:30:07,417
Dad, I want to go home.

728
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:12,167
Ina, let's go home,
we'll be right there.

729
01:30:13,125 --> 01:30:14,292
Let's go home.

730
01:31:03,167 --> 01:31:04,167
Mr. Yeon!

731
01:32:29,583 --> 01:32:31,500
She still doesn't remember
the underworld?

732
01:32:31,542 --> 01:32:33,250
I hope she doesn't ever remember it.

733
01:32:35,625 --> 01:32:36,875
How's the new house?

734
01:32:38,167 --> 01:32:40,583
It's good enough for us, very cozy.

735
01:32:41,708 --> 01:32:42,708
That's great.

736
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:49,958
If you want to use a credit
card, there's a 10% surcharge.

737
01:32:51,625 --> 01:32:54,208
If you blog about me, I'll
give you free talismans.

738
01:32:59,083 --> 01:33:01,250
<i>Total: $205,000</i>

739
01:33:07,625 --> 01:33:08,708
Ina!

740
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:12,083
Hi, dad!

741
01:33:12,125 --> 01:33:13,917
Hop in, little miss!

742
01:33:17,208 --> 01:33:19,333
It's okay, baby, he's a good man.

743
01:33:21,667 --> 01:33:23,250
You'll have to revise this.

744
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:25,000
I'll just ignore it.

745
01:33:25,024 --> 01:33:28,024
