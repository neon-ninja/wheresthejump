1
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,172
OK, Take it easy.

2
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,733
See you.

3
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,168
Turn it down!

4
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,729
I'm serious.

5
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,215
No way! I don't believe it.

6
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,857
No way. You're such a liar.
I can't believe you.

7
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,936
Oh, no. Look behind us.

8
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,653
That one's for you.
He's a live one.

9
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,578
He's yours. Here's my stop.

10
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,216
Hey, driver!

11
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,614
Hey!

12
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,731
Hey, driver, that was my stop.

13
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,573
Driver, that was my stop!

14
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,409
Driver, what's going on?

15
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,734
Where are we going?

16
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,814
- Driver!
- Where are you going?

17
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,939
Stop it!

18
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,659
Stop!

19
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,179
Please. Please, stop.

20
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,098
What... what is he?

21
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,539
I think he's dead.

22
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,729
Oh, no!

23
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,575
Oh, my God!

24
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,099
What's happening?

25
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,377
Oh, my God. We're dead.

26
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,256
Oh, my God! What is it?

27
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,579
What's that?

28
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,899
Oh, my God!

29
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,250
Oh, my God! Help me!

30
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,339
Look out, he's coming!
He's coming!

31
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,092
We've got to keep balanced!

32
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,771
Mommy, why can't Jesse wake up
like everybody else?

33
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,697
Oh, honey, he's all right.

34
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,697
He's just having a bad dream.

35
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,777
Mmm. Thank you.

36
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,129
Morning, honey.

37
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,409
Hi, Mom.

38
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,735
Well, two more. Hallelujah.

39
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,291
I want that room unpacked
by tonight, young man.

40
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,853
O K, Dad. I promise.

41
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,130
I don't want
any more promises, Jesse.

42
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,898
I want that room cleaned up, O K?

43
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,612
All right. I'll g et on it.

44
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,255
Angie, what are you up to?

45
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,177
I'm trying to g et
the Fu Man Fingers.

46
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,336
Want some eggs?

47
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,178
Jesse, are you O K?

48
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,655
It's just so hot up there.
I'm having trouble sleeping.

49
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,815
I know.

50
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,976
I wish you'd have
the air conditioning...

51
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,137
There's nothing
wrong with it, Mom.

52
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,329
It just needs a shot of Freon.

53
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,370
Here they are.

54
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,371
Dad, you're not trying to fix
something again.

55
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,296
Nobody likes a smart ass,
buddy-boy.

56
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,455
Look.

57
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,489
Who is that?

58
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,735
It's Lisa.

59
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,088
I've got to get to school.

60
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,448
Whoa. Who's Lisa?

61
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,729
Who is Lisa?

62
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,933
Just eat your eggs, dear.

63
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,973
Don't you use a key?

64
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,852
Why?

65
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,459
Somebody could steal your car,
couldn't they?

66
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,779
The deadly dinosaur?

67
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,216
Grady, come on. You can hit it!

68
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,417
Let's go, Grady!

69
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,495
Ready, girls?

70
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,339
Strike!

71
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,455
It didn't feel right.
Give me a break.

72
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,218
So, you getting any yet, Lise?

73
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,570
Kerry,
he's my ride to school, O K?

74
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,254
Are you all right?

75
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,058
You O K?

76
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,575
You O K?

77
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,019
Yeah, I'm fine.

78
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,415
Well, pay attention next time.

79
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,609
Very heads-up play.

80
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,774
N ice catch, Walsh.

81
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,253
Come on, come on! Let's go!

82
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,619
You're out!

83
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,378
Heads-up play, Grady.

84
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,819
All right!

85
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,329
N ice ass.

86
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,853
Nail him!

87
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,179
H it him!

88
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,335
Come on, slug him!

89
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,412
Here comes Schneider. Watch out.

90
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,690
Get out of my way.

91
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,928
Move it!

92
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,573
O K, dirtballs...

93
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,334
assume the position!

94
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,888
See you around, coach.

95
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,655
How much longer do you think
he'll keep us out here?

96
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,974
It could be all night.

97
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,250
He gets his rocks off like this.

98
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,450
Hangs around
queer S and M joints downtown.

99
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,137
He likes pretty boys like you.

100
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,375
Get out of here.

101
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,212
So what about
you and that rich babe...

102
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,693
you've been cruising to school
with every day?

103
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,775
What about her?

104
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,095
Are you mounting her nightly
or what?

105
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,097
Look, Grady,
you got some problem with me?

106
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,256
No, bro. Just killing time.

107
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,175
O K, dirtballs, hit the shower!

108
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,899
So you live around here or what?

109
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,136
Yeah. My parents bought a place
on Elm Street.

110
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,136
Elm Street?

111
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,330
You telling me you moved
into that big white house...

112
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,939
with bars on the window?

113
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,209
Yeah. What about it?

114
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,059
Shit. Tell your old man
he's a real chump.

115
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,772
What are you talking about now?

116
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,134
Some chick was locked in there
by her mother and went crazy.

117
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,933
She watched her boyfriend g et
butchered across the street...

118
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,539
by some maniac.

119
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,933
You're full of shit, Grady.

120
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,815
Shit.

121
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,259
Help!

122
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,338
Daddy can't help you now!

123
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,379
I need you, Jesse.

124
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,015
We got special work to do here,
you and me.

125
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,052
You've got the body...

126
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,811
I've got the brain.

127
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,093
You think
we should call a doctor?

128
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,938
No, I'm fine.

129
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,733
It's just a bad dream, O K?

130
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,932
Yeah. Go to sleep.

131
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,928
So...

132
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,939
to review...

133
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,379
the solid waste...

134
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,412
those nutrients not absorbed
in the lining of the stomach...

135
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,939
the large intestine...

136
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,415
the small intestine,
and the alimentary canal...

137
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,178
are passed out
through the colon.

138
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,219
Liquid nutrients
are then carried...

139
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,137
through an elaborate system
of filtering...

140
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,218
aided by the pancreas,
liver, and gall bladder...

141
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,416
or collected in the bladder
to be expelled at a later time.

142
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,255
And this entire process
is kept moving...

143
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,291
through
the circulatory system...

144
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,092
the centre of which is...

145
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,652
the heart.

146
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,217
Four chambers... just like
the human heart, really.

147
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,219
From the body...

148
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,568
to the right auricle...

149
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,769
to the right ventricle...

150
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,130
and out the pulmonary
arteries to the lungs.

151
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,094
There it trades off
carbon dioxide for oxygen.

152
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,415
Carbon dioxide is exhaled...

153
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,658
and oxygenated blood continues
passing through the veins...

154
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,975
into the left auricle...

155
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,455
through the left ventricle,
passing out again.

156
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,454
If you want to play
with animals, M r Walsh...

157
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,377
join the circus.

158
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,611
Lisa, sweetheart!

159
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,332
There's a Jesse on the phone.

160
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,655
OK. Thanks, Mom.

161
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,289
Where are you going, Jess?

162
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,773
Just out for a little while.

163
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,414
I told you
I want that room unpacked.

164
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,576
Dad, it's just for a few hours.

165
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,099
No. Upstairs.

166
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,778
Right now, son.

167
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,969
Right now.

168
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,178
How do you like that, Dad?

169
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,254
I'll leave the two of you alone.

170
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,449
Excuse me.

171
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,971
I told her you invited me over.

172
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,532
I guess maybe
I should've called.

173
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,535
It's fine, really.

174
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,855
I mean,
I was just cleaning my room.

175
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,652
I know.

176
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,692
I figured
you might like some help.

177
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,132
Where does this go?

178
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,209
Do sweaters go in the closet?

179
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,699
What's this?

180
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,617
I don't know.
Looks like a diary to me.

181
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,852
"Nancy Thompson,
1428 Elm Street."

182
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,095
That's right here.

183
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,616
You know this is five years old?

184
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,059
You know her?

185
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,375
No. Before my time.

186
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,049
Wait. Listen to this.

187
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,569
"Sometimes
when I'm lying here in bed...

188
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,850
I see Glenn in his window
across the way...

189
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,777
getting ready for bed.

190
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,697
H is body is slim and smooth.

191
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,811
I know I shouldn't watch him...

192
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,135
but that part of me
that wants him...

193
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,739
forces me to.

194
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,059
That's when I weaken.

195
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,091
That's when
I want to go to him."

196
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,815
Can I see that?

197
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,569
"March Fifteenth.

198
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,179
He comes to me at night...

199
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,178
horrible, ugly, and dirty...

200
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,733
under the sheets with me...

201
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,250
tearing at my nightgown
with his steel claws.

202
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,731
H is name is Fred...

203
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,896
and he keeps trying to take me
to the boiler room.

204
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,538
He wants to kill me."

205
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,893
What is it?

206
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,019
"Tina is dead"?

207
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,773
Jesse, are you O K?

208
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,931
It's just something
that Grady said to me...

209
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,130
about the girl
that used to live here.

210
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,613
How she went crazy...

211
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,459
when she saw her boyfriend
g et murdered across the street.

212
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,895
Go ahead, Jesse.

213
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,895
Try it on for size.

214
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,975
Kill for me.

215
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,256
It was
like I was sleepwalking.

216
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,331
Maybe you were having
a premonition or something...

217
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,735
like the guys
who help police solve crimes...

218
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,737
and find missing people.

219
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,691
You ever have anything like this
happen before?

220
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,855
No, never.

221
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,572
You think that's what it is?

222
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,258
I don't know.

223
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,450
Can I see the diary
for a little while?

224
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,769
Thanks.

225
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,016
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Kerry.

226
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,938
I got your invitation
for the party this weekend.

227
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,459
Any cute guys gonna be there?

228
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,377
All of them.

229
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,298
Is your dad
gonna be the D.J. Again?

230
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,297
Mom's gonna try to keep him
upstairs this time.

231
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,092
Oh, good.

232
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,573
Last party I had...

233
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,409
my dad insisted on playing
Benny Goodman all night.

234
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,697
I'll see you later, O K?

235
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,099
Hey, Grady,
do you remember your dreams?

236
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,699
Only the wet ones.

237
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,458
No talking!

238
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,052
Schneider shouldn't have called
you out on that last play.

239
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,530
Schneider's
got a stick up his ass today.

240
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,652
Schneider's
always got a stick up his ass.

241
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,577
Hello, dirtballs.

242
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,530
Oh, it is so hot in here!

243
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,097
Let me look at the thermostat.

244
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,294
My God,
it is hot as an oven in here.

245
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,492
Shh! The birds are sleeping.

246
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,538
Cheryl, it's
ninety-seven degrees in here.

247
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,654
Damn it!

248
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,378
Angela, watch out!

249
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,089
Watch out, Jesse!

250
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,498
Ken, are you all right?

251
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,609
Damn bird!

252
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,537
Look out, Angela! Get down!

253
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,250
Look out, Angela!

254
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,572
Jesse, g et out of here!

255
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,532
What are you doing, Jesse?
Help me move this.

256
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,218
It isn't the gas.

257
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,659
Don't tell me it's not the gas.

258
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,657
Your mother thought
she smelled gas.

259
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,498
Ken, I thought I did.
I wasn't sure.

260
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,497
Then what is it? Bird rabies?

261
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,099
It's that cheap seed
you've been buying.

262
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,858
Please, Ken, really...

263
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,698
There's gotta be
a rational explanation.

264
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,936
Animals don't just explode
into flames for no reason.

265
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,049
That's right.

266
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,249
All right.

267
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,859
It's sure not a leaky gas pipe.

268
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,410
- You all right?
- Oh, it's all right.

269
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,735
You set this whole thing up,
didn't you?

270
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,209
What are you talking about?

271
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,058
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

272
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,375
What did you use, firecrackers?

273
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,218
He used a goddam cherry bomb.

274
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,375
- Oh, stop.
- That's what he did.

275
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,172
You can't talk to me like that.

276
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,574
Jesse, come back here.

277
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,179
Come back here, Jesse!

278
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,619
Ken, stop it!
You're being ridiculous!

279
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,014
Stop it!

280
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,579
Shit.

281
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,771
Jesus, I don't know.
He does the strangest things.

282
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,899
Can I have a beer, please?

283
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,499
H it the shower.

284
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,017
No, God damn it!

285
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,459
Oh, boy.

286
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,656
Good evening.
Does this belong to you?

287
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,850
Yes, sir. He's my son.

288
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,175
We found him on the highway
wandering around.

289
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,131
He was naked.

290
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,860
I'd keep a short leash on him
if I were you.

291
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,969
Thank you.

292
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,374
Jesse, come in. Come in.

293
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,049
Come here.

294
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,498
Two questions...

295
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,095
you answer them,
and we can all go to bed.

296
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,253
What are you taking, son?

297
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,739
Who are you getting it from?

298
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,216
I'm not taking drugs.

299
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,375
Mom, I want to go to bed.

300
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,615
Yeah, come on.

301
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,178
It's a problem
I have to work out on my own.

302
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,972
I know,
but something's bothering you.

303
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,852
I'm concerned about you. Jesse!

304
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,813
I'm fine. Just leave me alone.

305
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,329
Can't we at least talk about it?

306
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,489
He needs professional help.

307
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,690
We have to take him to see
a psychiatrist.

308
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,175
Are you out of your gourd?
What the hell will that do?

309
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,212
I don't know. He needs help
we can't give to him.

310
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,659
Oh, come on.

311
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,214
Are you hearing me?
That boy's in trouble!

312
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,932
No, he's not in trouble!

313
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,528
What that boy needs
is a goddam kick in the butt.

314
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,570
That's what he needs!

315
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,008
Tell you what he needs.
He needs a methadone clinic.

316
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,889
What's happening?

317
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,336
I want all you students
to step back here.

318
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,774
Don't worry.

319
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,333
Let them do their work,
all right?

320
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,939
Yo, man, where have you been?

321
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,539
Schneider got wasted last night.

322
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,139
He must've been working late.

323
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,057
Some maniac sliced him up
like a kielbasa...

324
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,169
hacked him in the shower.

325
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,097
Got bloody footprints
all over the place.

326
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,334
Kill for me.

327
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,052
One, two

328
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:19,571
Freddy's coming for you

329
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,416
Three

330
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,019
Four

331
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:29,168
Better lock your door

332
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,011
Five

333
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,289
Six

334
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,618
Grab your crucifix

335
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,254
Morning, Jess.

336
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,415
Morning.

337
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,290
How come it took them five years
to sell this house?

338
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,093
Oh, I don't know.
Couldn't g et the right price.

339
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,575
You didn't know about the murder
across the street...

340
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,849
and the crazy girl
that lived here...

341
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,299
that saw the whole thing?

342
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,217
They told me something about it.

343
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,570
You knew something
about this, and...

344
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,737
How do you think
we got such a good deal?

345
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,618
Did they tell you
that that girl lost her mind...

346
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,856
and her mother killed herself
in our living room?

347
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,698
- What?
- Did they tell you that?

348
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,936
Mom, I'm scared.

349
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,049
Come here.

350
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,329
Oh, honey, it's all right.

351
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,815
Daddy and Jesse
are just pretending.

352
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,578
We shouldn't discuss this here.

353
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,769
See what you're doing?

354
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,333
I don't want to hear
one more word about it.

355
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,577
There's absolutely nothing wrong
with this house.

356
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,769
Come on.

357
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,014
Is something burning?

358
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,049
Good Lord!

359
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,368
That's the craziest damn thing
I've ever seen.

360
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,929
Look here, Cheryl.

361
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,408
It wasn't even plugged in.

362
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,734
Jesse, you can't blame yourself
for what happened to Schneider.

363
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,737
Just because you dreamt it
doesn't mean you did it.

364
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,849
Where are we going?

365
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,049
Bear left over here.

366
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,939
I really think
this is all in your mind.

367
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,449
You're picking up
some psychic signals.

368
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,849
What is this place?

369
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,819
Do you remember in the diary...

370
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,170
when Nancy said she kept finding
herself in a boiler room?

371
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,530
Fred Krueger worked here.

372
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,059
It's an old power plant.

373
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,575
Here.

374
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,569
What is all this?

375
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,419
I did some reading
on our friend Fred Krueger.

376
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,893
How long has it been
closed down?

377
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,658
A long time. Come on.

378
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,816
Fred Krueger
kidnapped twenty kids...

379
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,498
and brought them here...

380
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,894
and killed them.

381
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,169
Do you feel anything?

382
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,169
What do you mean?

383
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,212
I thought you might be able to
make a connection or something.

384
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,299
I feel like a jerk.

385
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,978
Shh. Just concentrate.

386
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,458
Do you feel anything?

387
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,494
Wake up, little girl.

388
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,179
What time is it?

389
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,015
It's late.

390
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,898
Go back to sleep.

391
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,338
Morning, honey.

392
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,529
Did you sleep O K?

393
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,218
Yeah, fine.

394
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,329
Good.

395
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,688
You're looking better.

396
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,212
You had another nightmare,
didn't you?

397
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,131
Yes, I had a bad night.

398
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,659
Do you want to talk about it?

399
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,816
My dad thinks I'm on drugs.

400
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,259
My mom thinks I'm crazy.

401
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,369
And you know, at this point...

402
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,138
I don't know
if I don't agree with her.

403
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,569
What's wrong with Jesse?
He seems kind of freaked out.

404
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,610
You want to go get a movie
or something, hang out?

405
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,459
Maybe g et things off your mind,
g et a pizza or something?

406
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,615
Hey, guys.

407
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,169
Hi, Ronnie.

408
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,299
You going to Lisa's house
tomorrow night?

409
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,251
Nope. Can't. I'm grounded.

410
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,052
How come?

411
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,489
I threw my grandmother
down a flight of stairs.

412
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,138
Jesse, I think
you should eat something.

413
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,295
I'm not hungry.

414
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,376
I wish you would talk to me.

415
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,649
We can figure it out.

416
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,498
We can figure it out tog ether.

417
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,497
There is nothing to figure out.

418
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,655
I don't know
why you're wasting your time.

419
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,453
- He's a basket case.
- Shut up, Grady!

420
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,899
You want me to shut up?

421
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,215
Fine! I'll shut up. No problem.

422
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,288
See you around, buddy.

423
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,779
Medium rare.

424
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,812
Hey! Cut that out.

425
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:30,889
I've got it.

426
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,494
Sweetheart, it's a nice party.

427
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,611
Come on, skinny.
It's time for bed.

428
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,453
You're in charge, hot shot.

429
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,973
Twelve-thirty, miss. No later.

430
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,011
- Twelve-thirty.
- Have a nice time.

431
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,973
What's the matter with Jesse?

432
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,929
I don't know.

433
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,929
I'll be out in a second.

434
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,415
Can I please come in
and talk to you?

435
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,848
Listen, I'm going to leave.
I'm not into this.

436
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,489
I'm sorry.

437
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,656
Jesse, why won't you talk to me?

438
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,015
- Will you just leave me alone?
- You're not being fair.

439
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,488
I want to help you.

440
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,014
How can you help me?

441
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,979
What are you gonna do for me?

442
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,809
Look, I feel like
I'm losing my mind...

443
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,534
and I don't want you to watch me
fall apart.

444
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,174
I'm afraid to go to sleep.

445
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,938
I'm afraid to stay awake.

446
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,449
I'm ruining your party.

447
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,774
They're gonna take me away.

448
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,652
Come on. Don't say that.

449
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,975
Listen, we'll stay up all night
if we have to.

450
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,614
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

451
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,616
Any second now. Any second now.

452
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,769
Party time!

453
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,777
I got the music!

454
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,573
What the hell
are they doing down there?

455
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,849
Oh, Eddie, they're kids.

456
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:32,097
I know they're kids,
but I got to get some rest.

457
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,379
What is it?

458
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,933
Jesse, what's wrong?

459
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,333
Jesus Christ!

460
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,098
You scared
the shit out of me, man.

461
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,816
Hey, what are you doing?

462
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,809
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing in my room?

463
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,770
Listen...

464
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,288
I'm in trouble.

465
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,932
I need you to let me
stay here tonight.

466
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,618
Are you out of your mind?

467
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,939
I don't know.

468
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,249
Oh, man.

469
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,255
Why don't you just go home and
take a bottle of sleeping pills?

470
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,777
I killed Schneider.

471
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,050
You what?

472
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,330
Only it wasn't me, see?

473
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,178
There's something inside of me.

474
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,019
And last night it made me go
to my sister's room.

475
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,937
And tonight,
with Lisa in the cabana...

476
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,016
it started to happen again.

477
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,734
I think you are seriously
losing it, bro.

478
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,578
I'm scared, Grady.

479
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,575
Something is trying
to g et inside my body.

480
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,895
She's female and waiting for
you in the cabana.

481
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,294
And you wanna sleep with me.

482
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,651
Look, I don't care
if you believe me or not!

483
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,133
Hey! I believe you!

484
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,410
You've had
some scary dreams, O K?

485
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,579
I don't... know.

486
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,453
I'm all messed up.

487
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,333
What difference does it make?

488
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,979
I'm in trouble...

489
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,977
and I need you to help me.

490
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,332
All right, man.
What do you want me to do?

491
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,934
Just watch me.

492
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,776
If anything starts to happen...

493
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,418
if I start to act weird...

494
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,292
or start dreaming weird...

495
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,012
or try to walk out of here...

496
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,493
you gotta stop me.

497
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,497
I don't care if you have
to hit me over the head...

498
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,338
just don't let me leave.

499
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,973
And, Grady...

500
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,978
don't fall asleep.

501
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,495
Hot dog?

502
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,928
Come back in the water.

503
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,093
I'm busy, O K?

504
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,057
I don't know.
I feel I should go see him...

505
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,296
but I can't
just leave the party.

506
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,456
Fuck the party.

507
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,019
Go see him.

508
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,731
The land of the dead...

509
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,532
I want youse to meet Lou...

510
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:34,618
And now I see the...

511
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,729
Gee, kid, you're a doll.

512
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,009
You sure handled
that situation...

513
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,894
Was he alive? That funnels
into a bottomless pit!

514
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,533
Sweet dreams, pal.

515
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,809
What?

516
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,457
It's starting to happen again.

517
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,329
Jesus.

518
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,250
Hey, man.

519
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,972
What the fuck's
wrong with you, dude?

520
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,453
Shit.

521
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,853
Dad, open the door!

522
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,850
Oh, my God!

523
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,058
Dad, open this door!

524
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,489
What is it?

525
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,213
Ron, open the door!

526
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,456
Ron, are you all right?

527
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,135
Ron, it's your father!
Open this door!

528
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,375
Open it up!

529
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,779
Get help!

530
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,215
You son of a bitch!

531
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,495
You killed him!

532
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,892
Is somebody in there? Open up.

533
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,975
Break it down. Come on.

534
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,849
Hit it again.

535
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,609
Again.

536
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,378
Jesse! My God. What happened?

537
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,333
I killed him. I killed him.

538
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,934
Jesse, my God. You're hurt.
What happened?

539
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,176
L... I killed Grady.

540
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,531
Lisa, I killed Schneider.

541
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,015
Oh, no. My God!

542
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,979
I'm so scared!

543
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,250
Jesse,
what are you talking about?

544
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:39,689
He's inside me.

545
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:42,009
I'm scared.

546
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,539
Jesse, who is doing this to you?

547
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,059
Fred Krueger!

548
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,859
He's inside me...

549
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,494
and he wants to take me again!

550
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,009
This is not happening.

551
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,779
It's got to be everything
you've taken in...

552
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,494
Schneider,
the diary, the glove...

553
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:05,655
only it's all mix ed up.

554
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:09,853
Christ, what do I have to do
to make you understand me?

555
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:14,012
Last night, he made me
try to kill my sister.

556
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,773
I got blood on my hands.

557
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,653
He owns me.

558
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,780
Could somebody turn down
the heat in the pool?

559
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,738
What's going on?

560
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,088
Shit!

561
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,329
Yay, Rocky!

562
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,052
Our hero!

563
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,693
Come on. I just want you
to listen to this.

564
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:20,290
It's something Nancy said
in the last page of her diary.

565
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,489
Listen.

566
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,611
"He is evil itself.

567
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:27,413
I know now that I brought him
into my world.

568
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:28,859
We all did.

569
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,777
Gave him
all the energy he needed.

570
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,495
Our screams
were all he needed."

571
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,140
Jesse, she wasn't crazy.

572
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,613
All this really happened.

573
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,537
You can fight him.

574
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,651
Oh, God. He's coming back.

575
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:58,849
Get out of here, Lisa!

576
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,129
Jesse, fight him!

577
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,454
I can't.

578
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:05,574
Fight it, Jesse.

579
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:10,492
You created him!
You can destroy him!

580
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,815
Lisa! Open this door!

581
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:15,613
He is living off of your fear.

582
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,173
- Jesse, fight him.
- I can't!

583
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,369
Yes, you can!

584
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:20,449
Fight him!

585
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:23,458
You're not afraid of him.
He doesn't even exist!

586
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:33,935
Oh, my God!

587
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:44,859
He can't fight me.

588
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,379
I'm him.

589
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:32,769
It's getting too hot!

590
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,777
Get out!

591
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,538
Get me out!

592
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,692
Jesse, help.

593
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,538
There is no Jesse!

594
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,139
I'm Jesse now!

595
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:57,013
Get away from me!

596
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,218
Kill me, Lisa.

597
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,573
Please kill me.

598
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:10,815
Come on, Lisa.

599
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,373
Kill him!

600
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,455
I love you, Lisa.

601
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,855
Oh, God.

602
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,859
Oh, please.

603
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,613
I love you, Lisa.

604
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,450
Jesse, help!

605
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:30,650
Hey, is everybody O K?

606
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:32,896
Search me.

607
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,658
What's going on?

608
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,099
Wait a minute! Wait!

609
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:22,449
Lisa, are you all right?

610
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:23,649
Mommy.

611
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,657
Get her out of here!

612
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:42,769
All right!

613
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,651
Just calm down, all right?

614
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:49,899
Relax.

615
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,053
It's going to be all right.

616
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,259
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

617
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:02,859
Just tell us what you want,
all right?

618
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,897
I'm here to help you.

619
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:10,454
Help yourself, fucker!

620
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:25,733
You are all my children now.

621
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:32,779
- Daddy!
- Oh, shit!

622
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,658
What the hell are you doing?

623
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,658
Where'd he go?

624
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:01,778
Come to me, Lisa.

625
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:09,931
Jesse, I know you're in there.

626
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,290
- Stop him!
- No. Jesse's dead.

627
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,175
I love you, Jesse.

628
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,376
Come back to me, Lisa.

629
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:03,771
I am not afraid of you.

630
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,537
He's in there...

631
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,651
and I want him back!

632
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,816
I'm going to take him
away from you...

633
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:19,096
and you are gonna go
straight back to hell...

634
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,539
you son of a bitch!

635
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:22,378
No. Jesse's dead!

636
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,418
Come back to me, Jesse.

637
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,532
I love you.

638
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:32,378
Come back to me.

639
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,853
He's dead!

640
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,139
He can't hold you, Jesse.

641
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,012
He's losing his grip.

642
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:43,539
You can g et out.

643
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:49,810
He'll die with me.

644
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,969
He'll die with both of us.

645
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,258
It's great to have you
home again, Jess.

646
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,699
I can't believe I'm going back.

647
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:23,095
- I'm glad.
- Good.

648
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:24,972
- Have a good day.
- OK.

649
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:27,089
Thanks, Mom.

650
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,658
What is so funny?

651
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:49,171
That was a really great party.

652
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,619
Thanks, Lise.

653
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:52,014
Thanks a lot.

654
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:55,289
I can't believe
it's actually all over.

655
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,978
Let's not talk about it.

656
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:06,252
What is this?

657
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:09,213
Am I going crazy,
or is this bus going too fast?

658
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:10,693
It's going fine.

659
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,048
No problem.

660
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:18,336
This bus is going too fast.

661
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:23,012
Lisa, it's starting to speed up.

662
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:24,493
It's fine.

663
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:25,609
Driver!

664
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:26,729
Driver, stop!

665
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:28,134
Jesse, just sit down.

666
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,289
I'm sorry.

667
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,455
It's OK. It's all right.

668
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,815
Jesse, it's OK.

669
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:55,373
It's all over.
