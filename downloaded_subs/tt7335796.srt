<i>"Beware of
the Jabberwock, my son.</i>

3
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:31,621
"The jaws that bite,

4
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:33,556
"the claws that catch!

5
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:35,358
"Beware the Jubjub bird

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,596
"and shun
the frumious Bandersnatch.

00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,965
"He took his vorpal sword
in hand

8
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:43,000
"Long time the manxome foe
he sought.

00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,435
"The Jabberwock,
with eyes of flame

10
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:47,339
"Came whiffling through
the tulgey wood."

11
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:51,341
Oh, hi, Rachel.

12
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,443
Mom wants Angela
to get ready for bed,

13
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:55,614
and she says it's time
for Charles to go home.

14
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:03,188
Go brush your teeth, Angela.

15
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,291
It's just a book.

16
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:10,495
People don't actually
go through mirrors.

17
00:01:11,631 --> 00:01:13,496
Here, play a song
on your music box,

18
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:14,634
it will make you feel better.

19
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:48,868
So, I was thinking,

20
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:51,769
my dad said I could...

21
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:53,371
borrow a car
from the dealership.

22
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,780
There's this place
that people go to.

23
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:04,614
And what would we do?

24
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:06,518
Um...

25
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:29,874
Angela?

26
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:31,374
Are you almost done
in there?

27
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:43,687
Angela?

28
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:57,567
Angela!
What is it?

29
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,584
This doesn't look so bad,
does it?

30
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:42,740
I'm not sure
what's going on.

31
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:43,874
I spoke to your aunt

32
00:04:43,876 --> 00:04:45,042
just two two days ago
and told her

33
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:46,542
we'd be here this morning.

34
00:04:46,544 --> 00:04:48,178
Is this normal for her?

35
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,947
We don't know.

36
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,149
I don't know what we're going
to do if she's not here.

37
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:54,754
We could go back home.

38
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:57,121
Hello!

39
00:04:57,123 --> 00:04:59,089
I'm Charles,
I'm a friend of Beth's.

40
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,258
I live down the road.
I was supposed to be here

41
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,861
when you arrived,
but overslept. I'm sorry.

42
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:05,195
It's all right.

43
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,597
You must be Olivia and Claire.

44
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,999
Is their aunt home?

45
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:10,134
She should be.

46
00:05:10,136 --> 00:05:11,669
I was knocking and...

47
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:13,906
Well, she's a little slow
getting around.

48
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:16,106
She's, uh...

49
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,209
not well.

50
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:19,743
Oh.

51
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:22,447
But let's go inside,
and we'll find her.

52
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:24,150
Come on.

53
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:30,754
You've got Olivia here.

54
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:31,889
It's gonna be okay.

55
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:33,523
It should only be
a few days.

56
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:34,694
We're going to find your dad.

57
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,494
Just a few days.

58
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:38,030
Okay?

59
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,738
It's all right, Claire bear.

60
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,072
Everything's going
to be all right.

61
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:51,911
We're together.

62
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,857
Hi, you must be Beth.

63
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,739
Excuse me.

64
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,016
I'm sorry,
is everything all right?

65
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:32,018
I don't want them here.

66
00:06:33,786 --> 00:06:34,787
What?

67
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:37,823
What I mean is...

68
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,660
I think it would be best
if you took them.

69
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:44,194
Yes, um...

70
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,363
that's not possible.

71
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,832
I thought I explained all this
to you on the phone.

72
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:50,302
Uh, who are you again?

73
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:53,037
Camilla Clark.

74
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,572
I worked with their mother.

75
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:57,875
Is there
some sort of problem,

76
00:06:57,877 --> 00:06:59,643
- because when we talked...
- The problem is,

77
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,947
I don't normally
entertain visitors.

78
00:07:02,815 --> 00:07:04,582
They're not just visitors,

79
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,251
they're your nieces.

80
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,754
Their mother's just died.

81
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:10,923
Your own sister.

82
00:07:12,324 --> 00:07:14,992
My husband and I are moving
clear across the country

83
00:07:14,994 --> 00:07:16,360
in a matter of days.

84
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:17,593
All of our things are packed.

85
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:20,664
We can't take them with us.
Not under these circumstances.

86
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,032
What about their father?

87
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:24,168
He's working out of
the country somewhere,

88
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,036
we haven't been able
to reach him.

89
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:29,075
I guess he and Rachel have been
divorced for some time?

90
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,308
I wouldn't know.

91
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,343
We've been trying
to contact him,

92
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:36,115
but we just haven't been
able to yet.

93
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:38,982
I'm sure as soon as we do,

94
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:41,952
he'll want to come straight
back to collect the girls.

95
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:43,821
In the meantime,

96
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:46,156
considering all
they've been through,

97
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:48,158
I really think
the best thing for them

98
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,962
is to be with family.

99
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:10,249
Don't mind your aunt.

100
00:08:11,851 --> 00:08:13,750
She acts a little...

101
00:08:13,752 --> 00:08:16,155
different sometimes,
but she means well.

102
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:23,229
She's a very
extraordinary person...

103
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,169
But she's been through
a lot in her life.

104
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,437
We should form a club.

105
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:35,739
Well, girls,

106
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:36,942
I'm afraid
I have to be going.

107
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:44,381
Your father will be here
soon, I'm sure.

108
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:45,816
And in the meantime,

109
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:48,785
if you girls need anything,
anything at all,

110
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:50,053
don't hesitate to call.

111
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:51,090
Okay?

112
00:08:55,227 --> 00:08:56,395
I'll let myself out.

113
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:02,768
Goodbye.

114
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:16,782
This is your
Aunt Angela's room.

115
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,984
The one who died?

116
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:22,119
Unless you have
another Aunt Angela

117
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:23,689
no one's told me about.

118
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,124
It's the only other room
in the house

119
00:09:27,126 --> 00:09:29,393
with a bed in it
at the moment.

120
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:30,863
So, you'll have to share.

121
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:38,204
I didn't want you
to come here.

122
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:41,405
And by your expressions...

123
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:44,009
I can only gather
that the feeling is mutual.

124
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:49,179
But you're here,
and while you are,

125
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:50,983
there are some rules
you'll need to follow.

126
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:57,221
No one in the kitchen
between mealtimes,

127
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:59,389
everyone in your rooms
by 10:00,

128
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,124
lights out by 11:00.

129
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:02,359
There's an elevator there,

130
00:10:02,361 --> 00:10:04,228
but it's broken
and dangerous.

131
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,796
Stay out of it.

132
00:10:05,798 --> 00:10:08,532
There is a bathroom
adjacent to your room,

133
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:10,500
so there should be no reason

134
00:10:10,502 --> 00:10:12,338
for anyone to come out
until morning.

135
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:15,241
That is my study.

136
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:19,078
No one is to go in there.

137
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
This door leads
to the basement.

138
00:10:23,482 --> 00:10:25,515
It stays locked at all times.

139
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:27,084
Why?

140
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:29,853
Because the basement
has rats.

141
00:10:29,855 --> 00:10:30,990
Any more questions?

142
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:49,072
This... is the dining room.

143
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:51,408
The kitchen is just there.

144
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,343
If you hear any noises
in the night,

145
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:55,078
ignore them.

146
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,480
It's an old house,

147
00:10:56,482 --> 00:10:58,849
and besides,
I have a tendency to sleepwalk,

148
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:00,317
so it's probably just me

149
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:02,788
bumping into something
or knocking it over.

150
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,990
If I see either of you

151
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:09,593
wandering the house
after hours,

152
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:11,263
there will be consequences.

153
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:14,266
Are all those rules clear?

154
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,168
Yes.

155
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:24,608
Claire,

156
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,080
do you mind asking Lucy B
if she understands the rules?

157
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:36,288
She says she does.

158
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:40,658
Since the accident,

159
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,293
she doesn't like
to talk to strangers.

160
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:45,095
The doctors say
it's perfectly normal

161
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:46,530
for a girl her age
who's been through...

162
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:48,365
It's a weakness.

163
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:50,436
And weakness is not good.

164
00:11:58,043 --> 00:12:00,510
Well, I have some work to do.

165
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,580
I assume you girls
can entertain yourselves

166
00:12:03,582 --> 00:12:05,017
until dinnertime?

167
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:07,353
Good.

168
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,021
Oh, hello.

169
00:13:17,122 --> 00:13:18,457
I was just looking around.

170
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:20,225
No, it's fine.

171
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:27,230
What are you doing?

172
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:28,567
Planting some flowers.

173
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:30,502
Pansies.

174
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,206
You could eat these,
you know.

175
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,578
Do you live here?

176
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,013
No.

177
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:44,414
But, uh...

178
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,615
I do come over a lot,

179
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,217
to help out with things.

180
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:48,418
Like gardening?

181
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,220
Yes.

182
00:13:50,222 --> 00:13:53,624
I suppose I enjoy
participating in the...

183
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:56,629
miracle of creating new life
in some small way.

184
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,598
And I never had
any children of my own,

185
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,467
so I guess in a small way,

186
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:05,602
I look on these
little flowers

187
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:07,204
as my children.

188
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:08,806
You might want to
get ready for dinner.

189
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:10,108
We'll be eating soon.

190
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:12,679
Okay.

191
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:31,263
Hope you girls like this.

192
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,431
It's actually
an African recipe.

193
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:35,833
Don't worry.
There's nothing strange in it,

194
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:38,335
it's mostly just chicken
and vegetables.

195
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:40,504
Your Aunt Beth would live
on toast and tea

196
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:41,507
if left to herself.

197
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:43,743
Well, bon appetit.

198
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:47,544
We're honored you could
tear yourself away

199
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:49,379
from your work
long enough to join us.

200
00:14:50,616 --> 00:14:51,816
What is this?

201
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:53,751
It's that African stew.

202
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:55,020
You'll like it.

203
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:00,592
I got you something.

204
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:03,761
They had it.

205
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:04,797
They did.

206
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:06,733
What's that?

207
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:08,467
A book.

208
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:12,369
A late Coptic necromancy.

209
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:14,406
On the history,
it's a book on...

210
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:15,808
history.

211
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,746
So, what do you girls
like to do for fun?

212
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:21,547
I don't know...

213
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:23,213
Stuff.

214
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:24,283
"Stuff"?

215
00:15:24,784 --> 00:15:26,616
I enjoy stuff.

216
00:15:26,618 --> 00:15:28,653
Maybe once you're
settled in, we can...

217
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,487
find some fun stuff to do.

218
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:32,622
They're not going
to be here that long.

219
00:15:32,624 --> 00:15:34,257
I know that.
But that doesn't mean

220
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:36,361
that while they're here
they can't have a good time.

221
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:41,431
So...

222
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,502
you two have known each
other for a long time?

223
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,169
Since we were kids.

224
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:47,905
Younger than you.

225
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:51,076
Yup. Everyone knew about
the Molnars around here.

226
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:53,278
Especially your Aunt Beth.

227
00:15:53,813 --> 00:15:55,145
Why is that?

228
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:56,413
Because your Aunt Beth

229
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,384
won a very prestigious
violin competition.

230
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:00,818
Really?

231
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,319
When she was only ten.

232
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:03,587
Is that true?

233
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:04,722
He talks too much.

234
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:07,092
It's absolutely true
and she knows it.

235
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:09,629
Claire, you haven't
eaten anything.

236
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,530
You better eat.

237
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:13,731
Lucy B would like this.

238
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:14,734
It has carrots.

239
00:16:18,503 --> 00:16:19,504
Come on.

240
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,213
See? It isn't too bad.

241
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:40,323
What's in this?

242
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:42,325
Chicken, vegetables,
some spices...

243
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:44,529
I use a little peanut butter
to thicken the sauce.

244
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:46,465
Why? Why?

245
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:48,398
Why?

246
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:55,205
Olivia?

247
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:57,374
Claire, breathe. Breathe.

248
00:16:57,376 --> 00:16:59,242
Claire. Claire, breathe.

249
00:16:59,244 --> 00:17:00,945
Claire, breathe.
Claire, breathe.

250
00:17:00,947 --> 00:17:02,379
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.

251
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:03,615
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Move!

252
00:17:07,854 --> 00:17:09,787
She gonna be all right?

253
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:12,857
I should have told you
she has a severe peanut allergy.

254
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,326
I'm so sorry.

255
00:19:22,387 --> 00:19:23,455
<i>Listen to me.</i>

256
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:27,958
<i>Come here. Hear me.
Listen to me.</i>

257
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,061
<i>Listen to me.</i>

258
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,563
<i>Come to the basement.</i>

259
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:34,765
What?

260
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:36,636
<i>Come to the basement.</i>

261
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:38,803
I can't.

262
00:19:38,805 --> 00:19:40,840
Aunt Beth told us
not to go in there.

263
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:43,943
<i>Go help Mommy, Claire.</i>

264
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,645
Mommy?

265
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:48,611
My mommy?

266
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:49,782
<i>Go to the basement.</i>

267
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,816
<i>Go to the basement.</i>

268
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:53,351
How? It's locked.

269
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:55,922
<i>I know where the key is.</i>

270
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:00,385
Hmm?

271
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:07,392
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

272
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,929
<i>I'm here with you.</i>

273
00:21:21,707 --> 00:21:23,774
<i>Move the piece on the side</i>

274
00:21:23,776 --> 00:21:26,078
<i>and slide the top off.</i>

275
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,949
<i>Slide it down
and then the top will open.</i>

276
00:21:45,497 --> 00:21:47,199
<i>Yes...</i>

277
00:22:23,002 --> 00:22:24,868
I don't want to.

278
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,303
<i>It's okay.</i>

279
00:24:03,135 --> 00:24:04,303
Mommy...

280
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:07,973
Is that you?

281
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:13,979
Where are you?

282
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:09,001
How?

283
00:25:20,713 --> 00:25:21,914
Then can I see you?

284
00:25:47,473 --> 00:25:50,307
"Mirror, mirror, open wide,

285
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:52,042
"let the spirit come inside."

286
00:25:54,113 --> 00:25:56,914
"Mirror, mirror, open wide,

287
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:58,382
"let the spirit come inside."

288
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:08,859
"Mirror, mirror, open wide,

289
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,360
"let the spirit come inside."

290
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:12,932
Mommy?

291
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:21,273
Mommy?

292
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:48,934
Claire?

293
00:27:04,383 --> 00:27:05,517
Claire?

294
00:27:45,257 --> 00:27:46,456
Claire?

295
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,559
What are you doing?

296
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,126
Hiding.

297
00:27:49,128 --> 00:27:50,427
From what?

298
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:51,430
From Aunt Beth.

299
00:27:52,331 --> 00:27:54,064
She wants to hurt me.

300
00:27:54,066 --> 00:27:55,299
What are you talking about?

301
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:57,069
Aunt Beth
doesn't want to hurt you.

302
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:58,437
Come on.

303
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:07,079
Please.

304
00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:09,214
Don't let her get me.

305
00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:12,217
Nobody wants
to get you, Claire.

306
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,055
I'll show you.

307
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:31,370
We can't go in there.

308
00:28:48,454 --> 00:28:50,089
What are you doing?

309
00:29:08,507 --> 00:29:09,875
Here it is.

310
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:18,217
This must be
what I saw in the mirror.

311
00:29:20,452 --> 00:29:22,285
How did you know about this?

312
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:24,089
Mom told me.

313
00:29:52,985 --> 00:29:56,219
Hello? Mrs. Clark,
this is Olivia McCallum.

314
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:58,321
Hi, Olivia. How's it going?

315
00:29:58,323 --> 00:30:00,357
We need to get out of here.

316
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,492
<i>You gotta get over here, now.</i>

317
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:03,960
What's going on?

318
00:30:03,962 --> 00:30:07,065
<i>I just found an article saying
that Aunt Beth murdered somebody.</i>

319
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:46,203
You're not eating your food.

320
00:30:46,205 --> 00:30:49,341
I'm not really that hungry.
Sorry.

321
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:53,043
Someone else,
on the other hand,

322
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:56,279
is turning into a ravenous
little tiger.

323
00:30:56,281 --> 00:30:59,652
I'm glad to hear that.
I was worried about her.

324
00:31:02,454 --> 00:31:05,589
You know...
I was thinking,

325
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:09,426
now that we've had a chance to get
to know each other a little better,

326
00:31:09,428 --> 00:31:13,263
it might be nice for you girls
to stay a little longer.

327
00:31:13,265 --> 00:31:15,367
We are family, after all.

328
00:31:16,602 --> 00:31:18,401
That's very nice of you,

329
00:31:18,403 --> 00:31:23,406
but I'm sure my father would
want to get us right away.

330
00:31:23,408 --> 00:31:27,611
From what I've heard, your father's
pretty hard to reach right now.

331
00:31:27,613 --> 00:31:30,080
Well, our friend reached him,
so it's okay.

332
00:31:30,082 --> 00:31:31,583
He should be here
in a few days.

333
00:31:32,284 --> 00:31:33,385
I see.

334
00:31:36,622 --> 00:31:39,523
Well, maybe we should ask
Claire what she thinks.

335
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:42,325
Now that
she's feeling better.

336
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:44,361
What do you think, Claire?

337
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:48,735
Would you like to stay here,
in this house, for a while?

338
00:31:56,308 --> 00:31:58,643
So...

339
00:31:58,645 --> 00:32:02,080
you'd like to stay here,
instead of going with your father?

340
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:03,683
Yes.

341
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:22,367
Get out!

342
00:32:24,136 --> 00:32:26,169
Get it out.

343
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:27,239
Get it out.

344
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:30,140
Get it out.

345
00:32:30,142 --> 00:32:31,678
Get it out.

346
00:32:32,611 --> 00:32:34,712
What are you doing, Claire?

347
00:32:34,714 --> 00:32:36,683
I wanna get it out.

348
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,217
Get it out.

349
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:43,754
I want to get it out.

350
00:32:43,756 --> 00:32:45,690
I want to get it out.

351
00:32:45,692 --> 00:32:46,857
I want to get it out!

352
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:48,661
- I want to get it out!
- Stop that!

353
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,843
What's wrong with her?

354
00:33:04,744 --> 00:33:06,311
I don't know.

355
00:33:07,512 --> 00:33:09,581
- I'll go get Charles.
- No.

356
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,719
To take her
to the hospital.

357
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,657
How is she?

358
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:54,557
She's sleeping now.

359
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,329
Well, Charles brought his car.

360
00:33:58,765 --> 00:34:01,231
Okay, then, I'll go get her.

361
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:02,867
There's no need to wake her.

362
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:04,635
I'll carry her down.

363
00:34:04,637 --> 00:34:06,304
You go wait in the car.

364
00:34:48,346 --> 00:34:49,816
Where's Claire?

365
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:57,054
She went into
the basement, didn't she?

366
00:34:57,056 --> 00:34:59,757
I could see it in her eyes.

367
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:02,461
It's the same look Angela had.

368
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,363
No!

369
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:07,564
No!

370
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:09,734
Get her phone.
Get her phone!

371
00:35:09,736 --> 00:35:11,468
No. Get off me!

372
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,005
Hold her still.

373
00:35:15,507 --> 00:35:17,977
Come on! Take it.

374
00:35:18,945 --> 00:35:20,612
Oh, get your gun.

375
00:35:21,948 --> 00:35:22,949
Okay!

376
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:26,618
Okay.

377
00:36:40,126 --> 00:36:41,828
No!

378
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:45,062
Let me out!

379
00:36:45,064 --> 00:36:46,598
Please!

380
00:37:05,852 --> 00:37:07,483
Everything okay?

381
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:09,722
Yeah. There's been
a change of plans...

382
00:37:13,626 --> 00:37:14,725
Oh, they're asleep right now,

383
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:16,593
so it's probably
not the best time.

384
00:37:19,464 --> 00:37:20,998
I'm gonna
pick them up in the morning.

385
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:24,502
- Okay. Yeah.
- Travel safe.

386
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,038
No.

387
00:37:32,078 --> 00:37:34,078
I'm up here!

388
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,814
Please, don't go!

389
00:37:36,816 --> 00:37:39,384
Don't go! Don't go!

390
00:37:39,752 --> 00:37:41,053
Don't...

391
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:48,460
She's gone.

392
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,659
Hey.

393
00:38:23,129 --> 00:38:24,163
Come on.

394
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:36,574
Come on!

395
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,882
Did you call the police?

396
00:38:51,691 --> 00:38:52,792
Gun.

397
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:55,094
Okay.

398
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:25,191
I found this under the...

399
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:33,263
You should leave.

400
00:39:33,265 --> 00:39:35,666
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

401
00:39:35,668 --> 00:39:37,868
I know all about you.

402
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:40,270
- I don't think you know what...
- Shut up!

403
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:41,941
Go get the girls.

404
00:39:44,576 --> 00:39:45,610
Go!

405
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,615
You try anything,
she dies.

406
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:01,127
- Where's Claire?
- She's in there.

407
00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:03,896
Go get her.

408
00:40:06,165 --> 00:40:08,901
Don't look at her,
just go get Claire!

409
00:40:18,811 --> 00:40:20,246
You're a courageous woman.

410
00:40:21,113 --> 00:40:25,049
Foolish, but courageous.
I admire that.

411
00:40:25,051 --> 00:40:27,953
I don't give a shit
what you admire.

412
00:40:31,657 --> 00:40:34,358
Oh, my God.
What did they do to you?

413
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,326
We didn't do anything to her.

414
00:40:36,328 --> 00:40:39,129
- Get down there!
- You can't take her away from here.

415
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:40,731
It won't let you.

416
00:40:40,733 --> 00:40:42,001
Just go!

417
00:40:51,977 --> 00:40:54,011
No, I don't want to go!

418
00:40:54,013 --> 00:40:55,079
- Claire, come on.
- No, you have to.

419
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:56,346
- Come on.
- No!

420
00:40:56,348 --> 00:40:58,248
- No. I don't want to.
- You'll feel better soon, Claire.

421
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,417
No! No.

422
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:02,286
Olivia, grab her feet.

423
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:03,921
- I don't want to go. No!
- It's okay, honey.

424
00:41:03,923 --> 00:41:06,323
No! No! No!

425
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:08,260
- Claire.
- I don't want to. No.

426
00:41:09,395 --> 00:41:10,595
No!

427
00:41:11,197 --> 00:41:12,898
I want to wait for Mommy.

428
00:41:13,899 --> 00:41:16,700
Mommy's dead, Claire.

429
00:41:16,702 --> 00:41:19,371
I know.
But she's coming back.

430
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:22,308
Back where?

431
00:41:23,676 --> 00:41:25,077
Into the world.

432
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:32,282
Let's get out of here.

433
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:34,251
I want Lucy B.

434
00:41:34,253 --> 00:41:36,019
Claire, we have to go.

435
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:38,088
Please?

436
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,125
- I need Lucy B.
- Okay, it's fine. Just be quick.

437
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:43,260
- All right?
- Okay.

438
00:41:43,262 --> 00:41:45,829
- Hurry.
- I'll be right back.

439
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:48,465
Okay? She's gonna
go get Lucy B.

440
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:50,202
Everything's going to be okay.

441
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,835
<i>Don't leave.</i>

442
00:42:34,446 --> 00:42:36,148
<i>It's safe in here.</i>

443
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:15,888
Where's your sister?

444
00:43:16,922 --> 00:43:18,224
She's gone.

445
00:43:19,425 --> 00:43:20,893
And your friend?

446
00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:42,512
<i>I was about
your same age...</i>

447
00:43:42,514 --> 00:43:45,351
<i>when I first learned the
truth about this house.</i>

448
00:43:47,453 --> 00:43:50,220
And I can assure you,

449
00:43:50,222 --> 00:43:53,492
I felt very much the same way
you do right now.

450
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:56,395
What is happening?

451
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,298
The first thing you need to know
is that your sister, Claire,

452
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,200
is completely innocent.

453
00:44:03,202 --> 00:44:05,969
Everything she's doing
right now

454
00:44:05,971 --> 00:44:07,306
is because of it.

455
00:44:09,908 --> 00:44:11,310
"It"?

456
00:44:14,246 --> 00:44:19,383
This house is inhabited by an
entity of extreme malevolence.

457
00:44:19,385 --> 00:44:21,585
It's using your sister
to free itself

458
00:44:21,587 --> 00:44:24,521
and get back
into the world.

459
00:44:24,523 --> 00:44:28,558
Yes, it says there are
three doors.

460
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,395
The mirror
is the first door.

461
00:44:31,397 --> 00:44:34,097
It leads to the mind.

462
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:37,167
The mind is the second door.

463
00:44:37,169 --> 00:44:38,902
It leads to the body.

464
00:44:38,904 --> 00:44:42,105
The body is the third door.

465
00:44:42,107 --> 00:44:44,107
It leads to the world,

466
00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:45,978
and to destruction.

467
00:45:08,033 --> 00:45:11,970
That thing is using
your sister as a vessel.

468
00:45:14,306 --> 00:45:17,374
Taking shape inside her.

469
00:45:17,376 --> 00:45:20,012
Just like it did
inside Angela.

470
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:23,882
So that's why you killed her?

471
00:45:26,418 --> 00:45:28,285
Yes.

472
00:45:28,287 --> 00:45:32,422
But only after I saw what she
had done to our parents.

473
00:45:32,424 --> 00:45:34,458
Then, it was self-defense?

474
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,962
Of course it was.
What else would it be?

475
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:42,301
You are not going
to kill my sister.

476
00:45:44,103 --> 00:45:46,038
Of course not.

477
00:45:47,573 --> 00:45:49,473
Why do you think
I came back here,

478
00:45:49,475 --> 00:45:51,341
to this house,

479
00:45:51,343 --> 00:45:52,945
after they released me?

480
00:45:54,714 --> 00:45:58,150
To find a way
to finally defeat it.

481
00:45:59,585 --> 00:46:01,654
To find a way
not to kill.

482
00:46:08,728 --> 00:46:11,261
Where do you think
she would be?

483
00:46:11,263 --> 00:46:15,132
She won't go far.
It won't let her.

484
00:46:15,134 --> 00:46:18,470
No. It needs
to keep her safe.

485
00:46:19,706 --> 00:46:21,907
She'll be somewhere
in this house.

486
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:32,015
Can I ask you something?

487
00:46:32,017 --> 00:46:33,452
Of course.

488
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,925
In the paper...

489
00:46:41,126 --> 00:46:44,161
it said that you were
a person of interest

490
00:46:44,163 --> 00:46:45,931
in Angela's killing.

491
00:46:50,035 --> 00:46:51,236
Yeah.

492
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:54,039
That's what they said.

493
00:46:56,308 --> 00:46:57,710
Well?

494
00:46:58,645 --> 00:47:00,745
"Well," what?

495
00:47:00,747 --> 00:47:03,146
Were you there?

496
00:47:03,148 --> 00:47:05,551
Did you see Aunt Beth
kill Aunt Angela?

497
00:47:07,252 --> 00:47:08,954
Yeah.

498
00:47:10,022 --> 00:47:11,390
I was there.

499
00:47:14,627 --> 00:47:16,261
And, no...

500
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:21,066
I didn't see your Aunt Beth
kill your Aunt Angela.

501
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:28,006
We were both there.

502
00:47:30,042 --> 00:47:31,376
But it was...

503
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:33,378
me.

504
00:47:34,346 --> 00:47:36,148
Me who...

505
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:40,250
But you never went
to jail.

506
00:47:40,252 --> 00:47:43,656
I ran before the cops
got there.

507
00:47:44,757 --> 00:47:48,558
But...
Not your aunt.

508
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,331
She thought if she could
just tell them the truth,

509
00:47:53,232 --> 00:47:54,466
they'd believe her.

510
00:47:56,101 --> 00:47:58,638
They interrogated her
for over 14 hours.

511
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:03,141
She could have implicated me
at any time.

512
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:06,278
Bargained for a better deal.

513
00:48:08,213 --> 00:48:09,381
She never did.

514
00:48:11,183 --> 00:48:14,152
She never even mentioned
my name.

515
00:48:17,122 --> 00:48:20,524
She spent the better part
of her young adult life

516
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:23,293
in a... mental hospital.

517
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,795
While...

518
00:48:24,797 --> 00:48:27,798
I graduated high school,
went to college,

519
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,169
got married,
got divorced...

520
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,643
I owe her my life.

521
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:47,386
There you are.

522
00:48:49,621 --> 00:48:50,690
So...

523
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:53,626
Do you think
you're up for this?

524
00:51:37,422 --> 00:51:39,257
Charles! Beth!

525
00:52:24,336 --> 00:52:25,403
No!

526
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:29,367
Claire?

527
00:53:39,111 --> 00:53:40,478
Who are you?

528
00:53:48,855 --> 00:53:50,923
No. Claire?

529
00:53:52,158 --> 00:53:53,458
Claire.

530
00:53:57,596 --> 00:53:59,697
Claire, stop!

531
00:53:59,699 --> 00:54:00,933
Stop, please!

532
00:54:02,635 --> 00:54:03,669
Please.

533
00:54:18,885 --> 00:54:21,151
How long till we get
this thing out of her?

534
00:54:21,153 --> 00:54:23,153
Not long.

535
00:54:26,025 --> 00:54:30,761
Uh, yeah. We just need something
that belongs to your sister.

536
00:54:30,763 --> 00:54:31,797
Her bunny.

537
00:54:32,632 --> 00:54:34,464
Perfect.

538
00:54:34,466 --> 00:54:35,968
The two of you go get it.

539
00:54:36,369 --> 00:54:38,037
Yeah, okay.

540
00:54:45,044 --> 00:54:46,578
It should be in here.

541
00:54:49,215 --> 00:54:51,050
No!

542
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:56,621
No, no, no!

543
00:55:06,498 --> 00:55:09,567
No! Let me out!

544
00:55:13,773 --> 00:55:15,607
Please!

545
00:55:22,949 --> 00:55:24,083
No.

546
00:55:27,954 --> 00:55:29,088
I'm sorry.

547
00:56:04,957 --> 00:56:06,192
Get away from her.

548
00:56:09,228 --> 00:56:10,928
Olivia.

549
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:12,730
What did you do to her?

550
00:56:12,732 --> 00:56:15,866
We just gave her a sedative
to relax her.

551
00:56:15,868 --> 00:56:17,835
Put down the knife.

552
00:56:17,837 --> 00:56:19,872
- Olivia.
- Put it down!

553
00:56:27,246 --> 00:56:29,682
You said you were
going to help her.

554
00:56:31,817 --> 00:56:34,818
I wish I could help her.

555
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:39,757
For more than 15 years,
I have tried to find a way to help her,

556
00:56:39,759 --> 00:56:41,559
and others like her.

557
00:56:42,795 --> 00:56:44,596
But I failed.

558
00:56:45,097 --> 00:56:46,632
You lied to me.

559
00:56:47,633 --> 00:56:49,333
I had no choice.

560
00:56:49,335 --> 00:56:52,336
If this thing gets out,

561
00:56:52,338 --> 00:56:54,306
many more people will die.

562
00:56:57,009 --> 00:56:59,278
It says in the book...

563
00:57:00,046 --> 00:57:02,913
"Only through death

564
00:57:02,915 --> 00:57:05,983
"will the third door
be closed."

565
00:57:05,985 --> 00:57:08,087
We have to do this!

566
00:57:14,293 --> 00:57:15,294
Give me the knife.

567
00:57:39,685 --> 00:57:40,884
Take her out of here.

568
00:57:40,886 --> 00:57:43,320
No.

569
00:57:43,322 --> 00:57:46,156
Are you really gonna
let her do this?

570
00:57:46,158 --> 00:57:47,991
Are you really gonna
let her kill Claire

571
00:57:47,993 --> 00:57:50,661
because of something
she read in a book?

572
00:57:50,663 --> 00:57:52,031
Don't listen to her.

573
00:57:52,998 --> 00:57:55,099
Think!

574
00:57:55,101 --> 00:57:57,334
Do you really want the death
of another little girl

575
00:57:57,336 --> 00:57:59,136
in your conscience?

576
00:57:59,138 --> 00:58:01,140
You know this has to be done!

577
00:58:12,184 --> 00:58:14,186
There has to be another way.

578
00:58:15,221 --> 00:58:17,788
There is no other way.

579
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:19,358
And you know that!

580
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,961
No.

581
00:58:22,228 --> 00:58:24,728
I don't.

582
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:26,966
All I know
is what you've told me.

583
00:58:28,734 --> 00:58:30,636
Don't be a fool!

584
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:32,972
I'm sorry.

585
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,215
You were always weak.

586
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:55,327
You don't know
what you're doing!

587
00:59:01,467 --> 00:59:03,300
She's not evil,
you know?

588
00:59:03,302 --> 00:59:06,737
She... She loved Angela,
and she loves your sister, too.

589
00:59:06,739 --> 00:59:09,408
She just...
believes what she's saying.

590
00:59:10,776 --> 00:59:11,877
And what about you?

591
00:59:13,312 --> 00:59:14,978
What do you believe?

592
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,513
I... I don't know.

593
00:59:16,515 --> 00:59:19,917
All I know is that when Angela
died, that thing was gone.

594
00:59:19,919 --> 00:59:23,889
Well, not gone, it's...
It's back in its cage, anyway.

595
00:59:26,192 --> 00:59:28,392
You're probably hungry,
I'll make you some food.

596
00:59:28,394 --> 00:59:29,795
No peanut butter.

597
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:32,831
Wait.

598
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:40,406
Are you sure about this?

599
00:59:44,176 --> 00:59:47,246
No. But what other choice
do we have?

600
01:00:32,258 --> 01:00:33,792
Not yet!

601
01:00:57,549 --> 01:00:58,884
Not yet!

602
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:20,973
Now!

603
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:24,276
Come on.

604
01:01:26,979 --> 01:01:29,415
- Fuck!
- Come on, Claire.

605
01:01:32,518 --> 01:01:34,953
Come on. Come on, come on.

606
01:01:37,022 --> 01:01:39,191
Come on, Claire.

607
01:01:49,101 --> 01:01:50,235
Can she take that many?

608
01:01:57,609 --> 01:01:58,844
Claire.

609
01:02:03,315 --> 01:02:06,684
Claire?
Come on, Claire. Please.

610
01:02:06,686 --> 01:02:09,254
Come on. Claire, come on.
Wake up.

611
01:02:09,922 --> 01:02:11,288
Claire, wake up.

612
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:13,056
- Wake up.
- Claire!

613
01:02:13,058 --> 01:02:16,026
Wake up! Wake up. Please.

614
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:19,563
Please, wake up.

615
01:02:19,565 --> 01:02:22,601
Please, Claire...

616
01:02:37,483 --> 01:02:38,951
I'm so sorry.

617
01:02:40,386 --> 01:02:41,520
I'm sorry.

618
01:02:47,092 --> 01:02:48,093
Livvy?

619
01:02:55,702 --> 01:02:57,469
Claire... Claire...

620
01:03:01,473 --> 01:03:03,306
My stomach hurts.

621
01:03:30,569 --> 01:03:32,102
Hey.

622
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:33,605
How's she holding up?

623
01:03:34,774 --> 01:03:36,306
Like you'd expect.

624
01:03:36,308 --> 01:03:38,608
Stubbornly insisting
that she's right,

625
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:41,111
that we couldn't possibly
have sent that thing back

626
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:42,546
using peanut butter.

627
01:03:42,548 --> 01:03:45,048
Then, how does she
explain Claire?

628
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:47,186
I don't think she can,
to be honest.

629
01:03:53,225 --> 01:03:56,326
It's enough to get you by
until your dad gets back.

630
01:03:56,328 --> 01:03:58,430
Beth asked me
to give it to you.

631
01:03:59,164 --> 01:04:00,165
It's all right.

632
01:04:01,099 --> 01:04:02,299
Take it.

633
01:04:02,301 --> 01:04:05,137
I think it's the easiest way
for her to say she's sorry.

634
01:04:08,741 --> 01:04:09,975
Where will you go?

635
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:12,677
Back to our old house for now.

636
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:15,078
Girls your age
shouldn't be on their own.

637
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,782
I think we'll survive.

638
01:04:17,784 --> 01:04:19,817
Well, let me give you
a lift, anyway.

639
01:04:19,819 --> 01:04:21,520
It's the least I can do.

640
01:04:27,593 --> 01:04:29,426
You couldn't find her?

641
01:04:29,428 --> 01:04:31,127
No.

642
01:04:31,129 --> 01:04:32,763
But it's okay.

643
01:04:32,765 --> 01:04:34,333
I don't need her anymore.

644
01:04:36,134 --> 01:04:38,437
Great. Let's go, then.

645
01:04:59,424 --> 01:05:01,159
Back door.

646
01:05:16,643 --> 01:05:18,375
Claire!

647
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:21,814
Come on!

648
01:05:24,416 --> 01:05:25,652
What happened?

649
01:05:36,829 --> 01:05:37,830
Claire.

650
01:05:45,304 --> 01:05:46,405
Olivia.

651
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:48,440
Olivia!

652
01:05:59,919 --> 01:06:01,484
Olivia, come on!

653
01:06:03,522 --> 01:06:05,288
This way.

654
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:06,456
This way, come on.

655
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,381
It stopped.

656
01:06:34,486 --> 01:06:35,621
What's happening?

657
01:06:40,793 --> 01:06:45,462
Wait.
I, uh... Wait, wait.

658
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:47,199
I read something here.

659
01:06:48,233 --> 01:06:50,600
Wait, it's... here.

660
01:06:50,602 --> 01:06:54,872
"It is possible, if their door
be not fully closed,

661
01:06:54,874 --> 01:06:57,675
"in traveling from the realms
of elemental darkness,

662
01:06:57,677 --> 01:07:01,546
"a spirit may become
caught between two worlds...

663
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,882
"tethered to their place
of origin

664
01:07:04,884 --> 01:07:07,317
"until such time
as they're able

665
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:08,721
"to complete their journey."

666
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:13,456
That must be it.

667
01:07:13,458 --> 01:07:16,259
That's why it still
wants Claire.

668
01:07:16,261 --> 01:07:18,595
And that's why it's able
to touch us,

669
01:07:18,597 --> 01:07:20,965
to affect us physically...

670
01:07:20,967 --> 01:07:23,936
even though
we still can't see it.

671
01:07:31,243 --> 01:07:32,511
I did see it.

672
01:07:36,615 --> 01:07:38,685
And I think I heard it.

673
01:07:44,657 --> 01:07:45,792
That means...

674
01:07:46,993 --> 01:07:48,928
maybe we can kill it.

675
01:07:50,362 --> 01:07:52,529
But we need something first.

676
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:53,900
What?

677
01:08:30,636 --> 01:08:32,602
What happened?

678
01:08:32,604 --> 01:08:35,405
Olivia!

679
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:36,807
There are flashlights
in the cupboard.

680
01:08:36,809 --> 01:08:38,410
There's more
in the kitchen.

681
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:41,712
I can't find it.

682
01:08:46,819 --> 01:08:48,921
Beth, wasn't there
a lantern in here?

683
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:53,325
Claire...

684
01:08:57,496 --> 01:08:58,865
What?

685
01:09:06,105 --> 01:09:07,905
Charles!

686
01:09:07,907 --> 01:09:09,572
What happened?
What happened?

687
01:09:09,574 --> 01:09:11,508
She's gone. It took her.

688
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:12,943
Claire! Claire!

689
01:09:12,945 --> 01:09:14,577
Claire!

690
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:17,648
- Claire! Claire!
- Claire!

691
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:19,850
I don't see her.
She's not here.

692
01:09:19,852 --> 01:09:22,387
Claire.

693
01:09:25,524 --> 01:09:27,057
The basement!

694
01:09:27,059 --> 01:09:28,795
The basement!

695
01:09:34,867 --> 01:09:38,535
- Oh, come on.
- Claire!

696
01:09:40,472 --> 01:09:42,041
- The elevator!
- No!

697
01:09:43,475 --> 01:09:44,710
What?

698
01:09:49,715 --> 01:09:51,447
- Charles!
- It won't open!

699
01:10:03,562 --> 01:10:06,065
<i>Say the words, Claire.</i>

700
01:10:08,034 --> 01:10:09,702
<i>Be a good girl.</i>

701
01:10:15,741 --> 01:10:18,010
<i>You wouldn't want to
make Mommy...</i>

702
01:10:19,078 --> 01:10:20,079
<i>angry!</i>

703
01:10:27,419 --> 01:10:28,855
She's upstairs!

704
01:10:36,528 --> 01:10:38,865
Claire!

705
01:11:27,046 --> 01:11:29,046
Run, Claire!

706
01:11:58,678 --> 01:12:00,478
No!

707
01:12:42,955 --> 01:12:44,088
Olivia?

708
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:46,726
Claire? Claire!

709
01:13:02,241 --> 01:13:03,575
Olivia?

710
01:13:04,944 --> 01:13:05,945
Olivia!

711
01:14:19,685 --> 01:14:20,853
Olivia!

712
01:14:37,002 --> 01:14:39,338
Olivia!

713
01:14:41,073 --> 01:14:42,808
Olivia!

714
01:14:43,709 --> 01:14:46,011
No!

715
01:14:56,322 --> 01:14:59,123
Mirror, mirror, open wide,

716
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:01,694
let the spirit come inside.

717
01:15:10,269 --> 01:15:14,073
Mirror, mirror, open wide...

718
01:15:16,809 --> 01:15:18,909
Let the spirit
come inside...

719
01:15:26,886 --> 01:15:29,086
- Don't let her say the words.
- Mirror, mirror,

720
01:15:29,088 --> 01:15:32,990
open wide.
Let the spirit come inside.

721
01:15:32,992 --> 01:15:35,794
Claire, don't say the words!

722
01:15:52,344 --> 01:15:57,283
Mirror, mirror,
open wide,

723
01:15:58,217 --> 01:16:02,186
let this spirit come inside.

724
01:16:02,188 --> 01:16:03,987
Aunt Beth, no.

725
01:16:03,989 --> 01:16:10,060
Mirror, mirror, open wide...

726
01:16:10,062 --> 01:16:15,267
Let this spirit come inside.

727
01:16:18,537 --> 01:16:24,908
Mirror, mirror, open wide,

728
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:29,079
let this spirit come inside!

729
01:16:29,081 --> 01:16:30,783
Please, no.

730
01:16:31,483 --> 01:16:33,817
Aunt Beth, I can't do this.

731
01:16:33,819 --> 01:16:34,820
Do it.

732
01:16:38,023 --> 01:16:39,189
I can't.

733
01:16:42,161 --> 01:16:44,528
No. Please, stop.

734
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:45,796
No.

735
01:17:58,904 --> 01:18:00,005
Claire...

736
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:06,945
It's over. It's over.

737
01:18:09,081 --> 01:18:12,818

This is being reported
as a murder-suicide.

But we aren't gonna talk
about that to anybody, okay?

766
01:20:59,184 --> 01:21:00,550
Livvy.

767
01:21:00,552 --> 01:21:01,553
