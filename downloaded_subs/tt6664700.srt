00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,939
Pull it out!

3
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:12,942
C'mon, you're not doing it
right!

4
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:20,608
He can't breathe!

5
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,209
You're hurting me! You're
hurting me!

6
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:27,905
Hey, I'm fucking serious! I'm
serious, I'm fucking done here!

7
00:01:27,907 --> 00:01:31,405
We'll talk about you going home
after you stop fucking breathing!

8
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:32,740
I want to go home.

9
00:01:32,742 --> 00:01:35,373
- Oh, he's scared!
- No no no, please! No!

10
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,506
I've made a mistake, I don't
want to...

11
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:38,973
Hello?

12
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:41,176
Can you be ready tomorrow?

13
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:42,406
Yes.

14
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:44,575
Good. Your mission awaits you.

15
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,241
I 100% agree with you.

16
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:07,472
why we like physical media so much

17
00:04:07,474 --> 00:04:09,771
is in that era, which we've
lost,

18
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:13,772
whether you were the big budget
Hollywood multimillion dollar movie

19
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:16,775
or the super low budget Roger
Corman film...

20
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:24,771
Hi.

21
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:27,175
Allie? Thank God! Where are you?

22
00:04:27,574 --> 00:04:29,508
Don't worry, I'm fine.

23
00:04:29,774 --> 00:04:31,838
No, listen to me.
You're not fine!

24
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,738
I know exactly what I'm doing.
You just have to trust me.

25
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,838
I don't know if I can trust
you, because you're off your medication.

26
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,742
I know you are.

27
00:04:41,274 --> 00:04:43,473
I've
got them right here.

28
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:45,476
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

29
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,941
I didn't mean for it
to go so far. Just come home, please?

30
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:56,208
I love you. Okay?

31
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:59,875
I know I've never said that
before, but I do.

32
00:05:00,573 --> 00:05:02,574
I wanna be deserving of you.

33
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:04,774
You have nothing to be scared
of.

34
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:09,607
I'm the one who's scared. I'm the one
who's been scared for so many years.

35
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,342
Not after today.

36
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:14,738
Allie, just stop.
Wherever you are, just turn ar...

37
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:06,405
My name is Allison Bell. I'm making this video
as a stipulation before entering Perdition.

38
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,939
I cannot say where I am, but I can say
that I am here of my own free will.

39
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:13,305
Anything that happens inside Perdition
is done with my full consent.

40
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:18,439
I release Perdition and it's staff of any
responsibility for whatever may occur during my visit.

41
00:06:22,774 --> 00:06:24,305
I'm here.

42
00:06:24,307 --> 00:06:27,705
Leave your phone and keys
in the car. The back door is unlocked.

43
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:33,841
Proceed to the ladies' room, you'll find a
release form there. Sign it.

44
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:51,972
God, this place is a shithole.

45
00:06:51,974 --> 00:06:53,972
Yeah, I think that's the point.

46
00:06:53,974 --> 00:06:56,474
I'm so fucking jealous
I didn't get picked.

47
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,972
I'll call you when I'm done.

48
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:01,175
Love you.

49
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:07,706
- Fucking wicked, huh?
- Yeah.

50
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,340
So this is it?

51
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:10,871
I think so.

52
00:07:10,873 --> 00:07:12,874
- Zachary.
- Allison.

53
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:17,341
Let the fun begin.

54
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,742
I can taste
the asbestos already.

55
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:36,407
There's a light down here.

56
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:46,806
You ever do this before?

57
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:48,808
No, you?

58
00:07:49,374 --> 00:07:51,539
First time.

59
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,472
I'm supposed to go in there.

60
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:54,839
How do you know?

61
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,842
He told me.

62
00:08:00,874 --> 00:08:02,874
Wow.

63
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:19,807
Shouldn't you read that first?

64
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:22,276
What's the fun in that?

65
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:52,240
Oh, I'm not doing that.

66
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:56,408
I will.

67
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,542
Oh Jesus, it's real.

68
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:39,175
What is it?

69
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:52,775
Put these on.

70
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,508
Cute.

71
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,672
How do I look?

72
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:31,275
- Get off of me!
- No!

73
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:33,608
Get off of me!

74
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:45,642
Just watch it, alright?

75
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:48,408
Easy, buddy.

76
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:50,642
Fuck you, man!

77
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:15,872
Somebody please help me!
She's dying, I need your help!

78
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:18,441
Oh my God! Come on baby!

79
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,608
Do you know why you're here?

80
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:27,871
Because female maintenance puts me
in close proximity to razor blades?

81
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:32,372
Yes. That is why you
are here at this very moment.

82
00:11:32,374 --> 00:11:36,272
But why are you back here, after
all these years?

83
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:38,805
I don't know how you want me to
answer that.

84
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:41,941
Because I'm fucked up? I don't
know.

85
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:47,372
You have unresolved issues. No
one can blame you for that.

86
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:51,504
But if you don't want to end up
back here, or worse,

87
00:11:51,506 --> 00:11:53,807
you have to deal with them. Head
on.

88
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:18,706
What the fuck
are they doing? Where-

89
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,708
Shh. I can't hear.

90
00:13:17,974 --> 00:13:23,674
Your
souls belong to Perdition now.

91
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:39,508
Sit down. Sit the fuck down!

92
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,842
Stay.

93
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,742
Good little doggy!

94
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,474
Welcome... to Perdition.

95
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,942
Am I being videotaped right
now?

96
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:30,340
You've seen our videos.
Of course you are.

97
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:34,905
Every moment of your experience
is being documented.

98
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,905
So those Chinese people... is that
what they're here for?

99
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:41,906
They're Japanese.
And they're from

100
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:45,571
Gashadokuro, you will treat
them with the utmost respect.

101
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:47,575
So is the world gonna see this?

102
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,707
I chose you for this night.

103
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,175
So consider it an honor.

104
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,407
Why are you here?

105
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,771
I told you in my interview.

106
00:14:57,773 --> 00:15:00,474
No, you told me what scares you.

107
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,471
That's not what I'm asking.

108
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:04,774
I have unresolved issues.

109
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,808
A fear. A darkness.

110
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,607
And you want us to what?

111
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:12,871
Literally scare the hell out of
you?

112
00:15:12,873 --> 00:15:14,571
I guess.

113
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:17,307
Any moron can scare you. It's
easy.

114
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:23,538
Is that was this is gonna be?

115
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,940
Cheap tricks? Because that's gonna
get really boring really fast

116
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,542
Boring?

117
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:33,906
You have no idea where you are
right now.

118
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:34,972
No one does.

119
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:38,774
We could be dangerous people.
Could be killers.

120
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:40,606
Really?

121
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,972
You have a website and a YouTube
channel.

122
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:45,341
How dangerous can you be?

123
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:48,539
I will be many things.

124
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,542
But boring will not be one of
them.

125
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:53,439
Masks don't scare me.

126
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:55,941
Oh, we all wear masks,
Allison.

127
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,905
Even you.

128
00:15:57,907 --> 00:16:00,808
It's what's underneath that
scares us.

129
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:19,870
What scares you, Allison?

130
00:16:19,872 --> 00:16:21,638
I don't know if things scare me.

131
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,471
Maybe I'm not being clear.
What limits you?

132
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:26,475
What holds you back from living?

133
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:29,404
I'm extremely claustrophobic?

134
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,641
Lots of people
hate small spaces, Allison.

135
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:35,674
It's like being afraid of the
dark, or spiders.

136
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:38,642
Unless it comes from a real
trauma.

137
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:41,542
What else?

138
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,871
This might sound
weird, but..winter.

139
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,272
You're scared of the winter?

140
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,372
No, I'm not scared of winter.

141
00:16:51,374 --> 00:16:53,375
But it reminds me of my
childhood.

142
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:57,575
And I don't like to remember my
childhood.

143
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:00,504
Too many bad memories?

144
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:02,507
Yeah, you could say that.

145
00:18:06,406 --> 00:18:08,407
Hello?

146
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,004
Who's in here?

147
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:24,474
Who's there?!

148
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:28,575
I'm not scared of you!

149
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:43,541
The darkness
fucks with your mind.

150
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,770
It plays tricks on the mind.

151
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:47,773
It doesn't take long.

152
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:55,505
Tonight, you
have two people going

153
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:58,275
through Perdition:
Zachary and Allison.

154
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,707
Why did you choose them,
specifically?

155
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,307
All I can say is you'll see.

156
00:19:03,507 --> 00:19:05,938
It was a decision I came to very
carefully.

157
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,004
And after tonight, people will
be talking

158
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:11,340
about their visit for a very
long time.

159
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,241
Repeat after me:

160
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,275
"I belong to Perdition now!"

161
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:20,271
I belong to Perdition now.

162
00:20:20,273 --> 00:20:22,274
I relinquish all control

163
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:26,440
of my mind and my body

164
00:20:26,773 --> 00:20:28,937
to Perdition.

165
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:31,439
I relinquish all control of

166
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:33,441
my mind and my body

167
00:20:33,907 --> 00:20:35,175
to Perdition.

168
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,438
I am nothing now.

169
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,404
I'm just a plaything

170
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,407
of Perdition.

171
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,238
I am nothing now.

172
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,870
I'm just a plaything

173
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:48,873
of Perdition.

174
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,340
Do with me whatever you wish.

175
00:20:55,907 --> 00:20:59,837
Do with me whatever you wish.

176
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,838
With enthusiasm!

177
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,508
Do with me whatever you wish!

178
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:09,606
Now take off your clothes.

179
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,670
What?

180
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:14,307
No.

181
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:18,407
Take off your clothes!

182
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:21,174
No.

183
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,641
You bitch!

184
00:21:43,373 --> 00:21:45,374
Alright!

185
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:49,474
Well, you don't wanna do
it yourself, I gotta do it for you!

186
00:21:55,572 --> 00:21:57,573
Put those on.

187
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:00,274
Take off everything.

188
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,874
Take off the goddamn underwear.

189
00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:10,806
All of it.

190
00:22:15,273 --> 00:22:17,274
Now put those on.

191
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,506
See, that wasn't so hard, now
was it?

192
00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:52,541
Babe. Not right now.

193
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,805
Just keep reading.
I won't bother you.

194
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,774
Seriously, I don't feel like it.
I'm sorry.

195
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:01,637
Don't do this to me.

196
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:03,640
I'm not asking for much.

197
00:23:04,706 --> 00:23:06,871
I'm in love with an android.

198
00:23:06,873 --> 00:23:08,607
Don't be a bitch.

199
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:10,806
Two months we haven't had sex.

200
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
Does that sound normal to you?

201
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:17,574
We're young. We have our own
place.

202
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:21,239
We could be doing it all day,
every day,

203
00:23:21,241 --> 00:23:23,241
but I'm not asking for that.

204
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:26,441
I'm just asking for a little bit
of passion.

205
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,341
Occasionally.

206
00:23:30,772 --> 00:23:32,840
Not once in a quarter.

207
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,671
Don't! Get off me!

208
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:44,673
What the fuck?

209
00:23:45,806 --> 00:23:47,806
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

210
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
Listen, I get it.

211
00:23:53,707 --> 00:23:55,870
You don't have to explain
yourself to me.

212
00:23:55,872 --> 00:23:57,873
You know it's not you.

213
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,175
I know.

214
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,274
Still doesn't make it easy.

215
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:11,841
I'm gonna go out.

216
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,806
You move you die.

217
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,941
You love your girlfriend,
but her touch disgusts you.

218
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:53,339
No.

219
00:24:53,341 --> 00:24:54,341
No?

220
00:24:55,306 --> 00:24:58,439
Well, it's touch itself that
disgusts you.

221
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,174
One of our basic needs as
humans.

222
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,841
Don't be shy.

223
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:40,638
Hey.

224
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,937
did you cut yourself?

225
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:43,737
Just give in.

226
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:45,740
I know you want to.

227
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:52,737
If you don't,

228
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:54,740
something bad's gonna happen.

229
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:37,571
Stop!

230
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:45,940
Night Night! You're next!

231
00:26:49,506 --> 00:26:51,506
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

232
00:26:57,506 --> 00:26:58,638
Allison!

233
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,474
Just do what I
do, or you'll suffer.

234
00:27:02,673 --> 00:27:04,674
You both will.

235
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:37,506
Stop!

236
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,841
Stop.

237
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:40,674
No!

238
00:27:42,272 --> 00:27:42,940
Stop.

239
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,740
Look at me!

240
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,673
Are you ready?

241
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,740
Would you
allow us to see your face?

242
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,274
You told me there weren't gonna
be any dogs!

243
00:31:34,972 --> 00:31:38,207
And for some reason,
you believed us.

244
00:31:38,573 --> 00:31:40,573
First one to find the exit wins.

245
00:31:41,406 --> 00:31:42,403
Believe me.

246
00:31:43,673 --> 00:31:45,673
you don't want to lose.

247
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:48,207
Twenty second head start, kids.

248
00:31:48,872 --> 00:31:50,206
Dog follows.

249
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,270
Get going.

250
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:29,741
Hey! Wait!

251
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:54,506
Zachary!

252
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,207
Help me! Help me,
help me, help me!

253
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:44,507
Looks like Zachary won.

254
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,607
And so, he'll be rewarded.

255
00:34:49,306 --> 00:34:51,307
Which means you lose.

256
00:34:55,805 --> 00:34:57,870
It's a madhouse!

257
00:34:57,872 --> 00:35:00,003
Say it! Say it!

258
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:02,339
It's a madhouse! It's a fucking
madhouse!

259
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,541
Say it! Say it!

260
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:40,772
No! No!

261
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,374
No, no, no! Please, no!

262
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:45,471
No, I promise I'll be good!

263
00:35:45,473 --> 00:35:47,474
No, I can't! No!

264
00:35:48,372 --> 00:35:50,936
It's exactly why
you're going to.

265
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:52,307
Please! Please!

266
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:56,471
No!

267
00:35:56,473 --> 00:35:58,474
Shhh.

268
00:35:58,972 --> 00:36:01,339
Dad! Let me out,
please!

269
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:03,869
Let me out, I promise I'll be
good!

270
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:05,872
Dad! No! Please!

271
00:36:06,606 --> 00:36:08,571
The more you scream,

272
00:36:08,573 --> 00:36:10,574
the worse it gets.

273
00:36:11,273 --> 00:36:13,274
That, I promise you.

274
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:16,174
No, no.

275
00:36:16,939 --> 00:36:17,873
No!

276
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:26,303
Let me out!

277
00:36:56,706 --> 00:36:58,703
What the hell is this?

278
00:36:58,705 --> 00:36:59,838
It's Jack Rabe's new
movie.

279
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,541
That underground filmmaker from
Ohio I told you about?

280
00:37:11,705 --> 00:37:13,804
Are you fucking kidding me?

281
00:37:13,806 --> 00:37:14,873
What?

282
00:37:15,672 --> 00:37:17,370
Geez, it's just a
movie.

283
00:37:17,372 --> 00:37:18,406
Is it?

284
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:20,503
Yes, Erica.

285
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,403
Watching horror doesn't make me
deranged,

286
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:23,704
which is how you make me feel.

287
00:37:23,706 --> 00:37:25,907
This isn't horror. This is
different.

288
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:29,605
And when you go after dark shit
like this...

289
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:33,307
I've seen it happen before.

290
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,673
I'm only trying to help, okay?

291
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:40,603
I don't need your
help.

292
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:42,303
Do you wanna end up back in the
hospital?

293
00:37:42,305 --> 00:37:43,903
Is that what you want?

294
00:37:43,905 --> 00:37:45,636
This is fucking dark
shit, Allie.

295
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,872
Rape, torture, beheadings?

296
00:37:48,938 --> 00:37:49,971
What are you doing?

297
00:37:49,973 --> 00:37:51,303
- Put those down!
- I am!

298
00:37:51,305 --> 00:37:53,307
Quit being a fucking bitch!

299
00:37:56,772 --> 00:37:58,640
Get your fucking hands off me!

300
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:04,474
Please don't go!

301
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:09,307
Let me out!

302
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:26,605
Help me! Help me!

303
00:38:37,473 --> 00:38:38,739
Let's just do it.

304
00:38:38,939 --> 00:38:40,940
Let's just do it. You're so
beautiful.

305
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:44,406
- Help me.
- I need.

306
00:39:20,273 --> 00:39:21,340
Hello?

307
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:23,872
Hello, Allison.

308
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:25,904
Hi.

309
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:28,840
I just finished
watching your submission.

310
00:39:29,705 --> 00:39:31,672
I think you're an excellent
candidate.

311
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:34,240
Really?

312
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:36,771
That's great.

313
00:39:37,905 --> 00:39:39,937
I need a letter from your doctor

314
00:39:39,939 --> 00:39:41,940
stating you're in good mental
and physical condition.

315
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,374
Can you do this?

316
00:39:44,972 --> 00:39:47,173
Yeah. That's no problem.

317
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,339
What scares you, Allison?

318
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,340
I don't know if things scare me.

319
00:39:56,806 --> 00:39:58,806
Maybe I'm not being clear.

320
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:01,339
What limits you?

321
00:40:01,772 --> 00:40:04,270
What holds you back from living?

322
00:40:11,505 --> 00:40:14,636
I went to the website
of this Perdition place.

323
00:40:14,638 --> 00:40:15,736
Checked it out.

324
00:40:15,738 --> 00:40:17,736
Honestly, Allison,

325
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:20,572
I don't see any therapeutic
value in it.

326
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:23,371
Now, you asked me to look at the
website,

327
00:40:23,373 --> 00:40:25,374
consider this as a therapy
option.

328
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:27,436
I looked at it.

329
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:29,438
I read everything on that
website,

330
00:40:29,906 --> 00:40:31,907
and I have considered this
carefully.

331
00:40:32,439 --> 00:40:34,439
My answer is no.

332
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:37,174
I strongly urge you not to go.

333
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:41,604
And I absolutely cannot write
you a letter

334
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,206
of mental health.

335
00:40:45,672 --> 00:40:47,936
You have made significant
progress

336
00:40:47,938 --> 00:40:50,003
over the past decade in the wake

337
00:40:50,005 --> 00:40:52,640
of traumatic events in your
life.

338
00:40:53,938 --> 00:40:56,271
You've moved back into the
world.

339
00:40:56,273 --> 00:40:57,537
You have an apartment,

340
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,636
you're in a good relationship.

341
00:40:59,638 --> 00:41:01,669
Don't throw it all away

342
00:41:01,671 --> 00:41:03,536
over a dumb haunted house.

343
00:41:03,538 --> 00:41:04,805
It's not dumb.

344
00:41:05,404 --> 00:41:06,539
It's what I want.

345
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:07,839
It's what I need.

346
00:41:09,871 --> 00:41:12,239
This infatuation with horror

347
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,370
has the potential to derail

348
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:15,740
all your progress.

349
00:41:16,372 --> 00:41:18,605
Horror is no better than
pornography.

350
00:41:18,972 --> 00:41:20,337
It's smut,

351
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:21,805
dressed up as entertainment.

352
00:41:22,371 --> 00:41:24,605
It serves no greater purpose.

353
00:41:25,371 --> 00:41:27,572
It's death, on sale.

354
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:30,540
And on sale cheap.

355
00:41:35,738 --> 00:41:37,740
Allison?

356
00:41:39,939 --> 00:41:41,206
Allison?

357
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,273
Allison?

358
00:41:45,438 --> 00:41:46,470
I'm going to forget we

359
00:41:46,472 --> 00:41:48,273
ever had this conversation.

360
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:51,539
Do I have to schedule another
evaluation?

361
00:41:52,273 --> 00:41:54,473
No, Dr. Nicholas, we don't.

362
00:41:55,005 --> 00:41:56,207
Okay.

363
00:41:56,572 --> 00:41:58,436
You forget about this.

364
00:41:58,438 --> 00:42:00,004
You'll thank me.

365
00:42:28,906 --> 00:42:30,907
Leave me alone!

366
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:58,706
The dog's alive! Yeah!

367
00:42:58,938 --> 00:43:01,338
John Hainey, thirty-eight years
old.

368
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,906
Been with Perdition for... geez.

369
00:43:05,438 --> 00:43:07,537
Going on ten years now.

370
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:08,640
This is Russell.

371
00:43:10,973 --> 00:43:12,438
This is pretty boy, Floyd.

372
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:13,504
Prop gun.

373
00:43:13,506 --> 00:43:15,673
I used to work in special makeup
effects.

374
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:17,636
Underground films, mostly.

375
00:43:19,672 --> 00:43:20,769
You play how many characters?

376
00:43:20,771 --> 00:43:21,570
Three.

377
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:24,240
Beanie, Psycho Clown, and
Gorilla.

378
00:43:24,906 --> 00:43:26,536
Now, the Gorilla is obviously
the one closest

379
00:43:26,538 --> 00:43:27,803
to my own personality.

380
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:28,869
When I first started,

381
00:43:28,871 --> 00:43:30,536
I was what we call White Skull.

382
00:43:30,538 --> 00:43:31,903
That's the entry-level position.

383
00:43:31,905 --> 00:43:33,173
Mainly grunt work.

384
00:43:33,571 --> 00:43:34,603
But after a year of that,

385
00:43:34,605 --> 00:43:36,302
I graduated character work.

386
00:43:36,304 --> 00:43:37,971
This gives me more of an
opportunity

387
00:43:37,973 --> 00:43:39,540
to express myself artistically.

388
00:43:49,238 --> 00:43:50,171
Tell us your name.

389
00:43:50,173 --> 00:43:52,306
Phil Cutter. Been with Perdition
ten years.

390
00:43:53,372 --> 00:43:54,903
What made you
want to scare people?

391
00:43:54,905 --> 00:43:56,470
I served eight tours,

392
00:43:56,472 --> 00:43:58,236
Iraq and Afghanistan,

393
00:43:58,238 --> 00:44:00,336
and uh saw some bad shit,

394
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,173
and this is therapy for me.

395
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:05,769
How did you meet Bob?

396
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:07,336
He was a struggling screenwriter

397
00:44:07,338 --> 00:44:08,503
when I met him.

398
00:44:08,505 --> 00:44:09,937
He was writing a Vietnam script,

399
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,971
something for a military
advisor.

400
00:44:11,973 --> 00:44:14,004
He was a friend of a friend so I
helped out.

401
00:44:14,006 --> 00:44:16,004
The script went nowhere, but uh

402
00:44:16,006 --> 00:44:18,269
that was our first
collaboration,

403
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:20,672
and uh, he's an interesting guy.

404
00:44:24,005 --> 00:44:26,672
What unique
skills do you bring Perdition?

405
00:45:31,705 --> 00:45:33,705
What do you want from us?

406
00:45:34,805 --> 00:45:36,805
What?

407
00:45:39,405 --> 00:45:41,004
Now listen carefully.

408
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:42,569
It's a simple question.

409
00:45:42,571 --> 00:45:44,539
What do you

410
00:45:45,671 --> 00:45:46,739
want from us?

411
00:45:47,872 --> 00:45:49,873
I don't know what you mean.

412
00:46:03,872 --> 00:46:05,540
What do you

413
00:46:06,371 --> 00:46:07,506
want from us?

414
00:46:08,006 --> 00:46:10,539
I want you to push me to my
limits!

415
00:46:49,605 --> 00:46:52,273
What are you-what are
you doing to her?

416
00:46:53,304 --> 00:46:54,604
What are you doing to her?!

417
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:55,639
Stop!

418
00:46:59,405 --> 00:47:01,470
What do you want from us,
Allison?

419
00:47:01,472 --> 00:47:04,639
Stop! I want you to stop!

420
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:08,506
That's the wrong answer.

421
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:22,004
What do you want from us,
Allison?

422
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,839
I felt like I was drowning!

423
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:25,940
You can't do this!

424
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:31,837
Stop it!

425
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,903
Stop it, you're gonna kill her!

426
00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:41,870
What do you want from us?

427
00:47:41,872 --> 00:47:43,337
I want you to make me

428
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:44,603
face my fears!

429
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:45,672
What fears?

430
00:48:04,005 --> 00:48:05,272
Daddy.

431
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:13,940
Stop, something's wrong with
her! Stop!

432
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:18,536
Allison. Allison, listen to me!
Listen to me,

433
00:48:18,538 --> 00:48:20,705
you're having a panic attack,
okay?

434
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:23,502
I'm gonna say a sequence of
numbers,

435
00:48:23,504 --> 00:48:25,670
and I want you to repeat them
back to me,

436
00:48:25,672 --> 00:48:26,907
do you understand?

437
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:29,337
Now listen, here we go, here we
go

438
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,336
2, 5, 4,

439
00:48:31,338 --> 00:48:33,472
6, 0, 8, 9.

440
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:36,670
Six, oh, eight.

441
00:48:36,672 --> 00:48:37,673
Yeah

442
00:48:40,605 --> 00:48:41,904
What's happening?

443
00:48:41,906 --> 00:48:43,337
Don't worry.

444
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:44,969
It's all under control.

445
00:48:44,971 --> 00:48:47,772
It's okay. 6, 8, 4,

446
00:48:48,238 --> 00:48:50,238
1, 3, 7, 2.

447
00:48:50,671 --> 00:48:52,672
6, 8, 5

448
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:55,273
...no, 4, 4...

449
00:48:56,906 --> 00:48:59,173
Calm down, calm down. it's
okay.

450
00:48:59,805 --> 00:49:01,870
one

451
00:49:04,338 --> 00:49:06,338
Take it easy. It's alright.

452
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,905
It's alright.

453
00:49:17,439 --> 00:49:18,503
Stop. Stop!

454
00:49:18,505 --> 00:49:20,405
Let go of me! Help!

455
00:49:20,871 --> 00:49:22,505
Stop! Let go!

456
00:49:23,739 --> 00:49:24,740
Get off of him!

457
00:49:25,605 --> 00:49:28,203
Why'd you say "Daddy"?

458
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:28,870
Because I'm fucked up, okay?

459
00:49:28,872 --> 00:49:30,873
Now we're getting somewhere.

460
00:49:31,971 --> 00:49:33,273
Why are you here?

461
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:35,570
To see what I'm capable of!

462
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:36,536
Yeah, why?

463
00:49:36,538 --> 00:49:38,540
- 'Cause I'm afraid.
- Of what?

464
00:49:39,238 --> 00:49:41,236
That I'll never amount to
anything!

465
00:49:41,238 --> 00:49:42,171
Chill Hipster brain,

466
00:49:42,173 --> 00:49:43,970
come up with that shit all on
your own?

467
00:49:43,972 --> 00:49:45,369
- No.
- Yeah

468
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:45,406
Yeah, then where'd you hear it?

469
00:49:47,605 --> 00:49:49,470
From my parents.

470
00:49:49,472 --> 00:49:51,604
Sounds like they know you pretty
well.

471
00:49:51,606 --> 00:49:52,939
What else they have to say?

472
00:49:53,904 --> 00:49:55,705
That I'm not strong enough.

473
00:49:55,938 --> 00:49:57,272
That I'm weak.

474
00:49:57,671 --> 00:49:58,872
I'm... I'm

475
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:01,473
- a loser!
- Keep going!

476
00:50:01,938 --> 00:50:02,938
Hey!

477
00:50:03,672 --> 00:50:05,473
Oh, you ready to talk now?

478
00:50:06,372 --> 00:50:07,373
Yeah.

479
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:08,740
Alright.

480
00:50:10,805 --> 00:50:12,938
You ready to tell me what I
wanna hear?

481
00:50:15,738 --> 00:50:16,739
Yeah.

482
00:50:17,539 --> 00:50:18,706
Well I'm all ears.

483
00:50:21,339 --> 00:50:22,803
Oh, shit!

484
00:50:22,805 --> 00:50:24,805
Did you see that?

485
00:50:25,937 --> 00:50:26,938
Fuck!

486
00:50:51,639 --> 00:50:53,336
I got a treat for you, honey.

487
00:50:53,338 --> 00:50:55,338
No! No! No!

488
00:50:58,639 --> 00:50:59,706
No!

489
00:51:08,605 --> 00:51:09,906
No! No!

490
00:51:24,272 --> 00:51:25,737
I'm drowning!

491
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:27,872
Shut up and drown, then!

492
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,406
Tell me about your father.

493
00:51:50,605 --> 00:51:51,606
Go to Hell!

494
00:51:51,971 --> 00:51:53,569
I'm not playing.

495
00:51:53,571 --> 00:51:54,868
Why should I tell you?

496
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:57,703
You're just some fucking loser
in a mask!

497
00:52:14,371 --> 00:52:15,506
I can't help you.

498
00:52:39,771 --> 00:52:41,302
Fuck!

499
00:52:41,304 --> 00:52:42,936
God, this mask can go fuck
itself,

500
00:52:42,938 --> 00:52:44,469
I'm tired of this thing.

501
00:52:44,471 --> 00:52:45,470
You know, I shoulda been

502
00:52:45,472 --> 00:52:46,473
fucking Peep Show Girl.

503
00:52:47,737 --> 00:52:48,935
I'm way hotter than that bitch

504
00:52:48,937 --> 00:52:50,637
anyway and then she just comes
in like,

505
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:52,436
"I'm Hainey's wife!

506
00:52:52,438 --> 00:52:54,338
I should be Peep Show Girl!"

507
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,305
Fucking stupid bitch.

508
00:53:01,738 --> 00:53:02,739
What's wrong?

509
00:53:05,705 --> 00:53:06,705
You okay?

510
00:53:10,404 --> 00:53:11,405
Look at me.

511
00:53:13,638 --> 00:53:14,804
Who's your sister?

512
00:53:18,606 --> 00:53:19,405
Who loves you?

513
00:53:23,472 --> 00:53:24,872
You bet your ass I do.

514
00:53:34,938 --> 00:53:37,473
We're gonna get outta here soon,
okay?

515
00:53:37,738 --> 00:53:38,739
Just temporary.

516
00:53:40,004 --> 00:53:41,206
Grab a gun.

517
00:53:49,571 --> 00:53:50,838
I love the way I look.

518
00:54:22,671 --> 00:54:23,672
Help!

519
00:54:31,671 --> 00:54:32,672
Help me!

520
00:54:34,338 --> 00:54:35,339
Help!

521
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:32,704
You see this?

522
00:55:33,937 --> 00:55:36,506
That there is Boticelli's map of
hell

523
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:40,272
Now, Perdition,

524
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,339
that's my hell.

525
00:55:43,938 --> 00:55:45,303
For the time,

526
00:55:45,305 --> 00:55:46,306
yours too.

527
00:55:46,937 --> 00:55:47,938
See,

528
00:55:48,472 --> 00:55:50,305
the crime that got me here,

529
00:55:51,371 --> 00:55:52,871
well, that was cowardice

530
00:55:53,371 --> 00:55:54,437
Didn't even get me to

531
00:55:54,439 --> 00:55:56,373
the top of the first circle.

532
00:55:57,737 --> 00:55:58,771
Now see I'm...

533
00:55:59,705 --> 00:56:01,639
I'm just outside the gates,
right there.

534
00:56:03,472 --> 00:56:04,472
So,

535
00:56:04,904 --> 00:56:05,905
every day,

536
00:56:07,771 --> 00:56:09,539
I have to pay for my sins.

537
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:11,705
My family

538
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:14,639
would go on vacation in
New Jersey every summer.

539
00:56:16,305 --> 00:56:17,405
Wild Wood.

540
00:56:18,404 --> 00:56:20,738
My mom, my dad,

541
00:56:22,304 --> 00:56:23,571
and my brother Joey.

542
00:56:24,638 --> 00:56:25,702
See, Joey,

543
00:56:25,704 --> 00:56:27,803
he was two years older than me.

544
00:56:27,805 --> 00:56:28,936
His favorite ride was...

545
00:56:28,938 --> 00:56:30,536
was always the haunted houses.

546
00:56:30,538 --> 00:56:32,239
I'm scared to hell of it,

547
00:56:33,504 --> 00:56:34,602
he would tease me.

548
00:56:34,604 --> 00:56:36,237
Until I eventually agreed

549
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:37,502
to go on the ride with him.

550
00:56:37,504 --> 00:56:38,535
But even then, I just, I just

551
00:56:38,537 --> 00:56:40,302
still just, I closed my eyes

552
00:56:40,304 --> 00:56:41,672
the entire ride, right.

553
00:56:42,738 --> 00:56:44,502
But the scariest one of them all
was

554
00:56:44,504 --> 00:56:45,905
called the Pit of Doom.

555
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:47,872
One night,

556
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:49,738
while we were there,

557
00:56:50,004 --> 00:56:51,206
it burned.

558
00:56:52,238 --> 00:56:54,871
Joey and I were on that ride
when it went down.

559
00:56:56,604 --> 00:56:58,239
Halfway through the ride,

560
00:56:59,271 --> 00:57:00,272
we stopped.

561
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:03,306
Lights went out.

562
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:06,804
Smoke was everywhere.

563
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:08,472
The place it, it...

564
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,471
was engulfed in seconds, really

565
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:15,206
but a man with a flashlight came
by.

566
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:17,605
Found us.

567
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:20,003
He pulled us out of the car.

568
00:57:20,005 --> 00:57:22,536
He told us, told us to hold
hands.

569
00:57:22,538 --> 00:57:24,273
"Don't let go!" he said.

570
00:57:24,937 --> 00:57:26,172
So he held mine,

571
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:28,272
and I held Joey's.

572
00:57:29,437 --> 00:57:32,337
He lead us through this, this
burning maze.

573
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:33,402
Searching for a way out

574
00:57:33,404 --> 00:57:34,702
but we couldn't breath,

575
00:57:34,704 --> 00:57:35,936
and we couldn't see.

576
00:57:35,938 --> 00:57:38,435
It was then that Joey's hand

577
00:57:38,437 --> 00:57:39,804
slipped from my grasp.

578
00:57:41,972 --> 00:57:43,501
And I didn't

579
00:57:43,503 --> 00:57:45,504
say. A thing.

580
00:57:47,604 --> 00:57:49,704
I was too afraid, hmmm? Yeah.

581
00:57:50,972 --> 00:57:52,539
So I just kept moving on,

582
00:57:53,338 --> 00:57:54,769
kept getting pulled forward,

583
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:56,669
and then it wasn't until we were
outside

584
00:57:56,671 --> 00:57:59,337
when they realized that Joey was
no longer

585
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:00,505
behind me.

586
00:58:03,339 --> 00:58:04,804
By then it was too late.

587
00:58:07,338 --> 00:58:08,672
Place was an inferno.

588
00:58:08,871 --> 00:58:10,505
They didn't blame me though.

589
00:58:11,737 --> 00:58:13,438
I was just a kid, right?

590
00:58:15,904 --> 00:58:17,671
I could've said something.

591
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:20,704
I could've done something.

592
00:58:23,304 --> 00:58:24,538
I let Joey die,

593
00:58:25,604 --> 00:58:27,371
because I was too afraid.

594
00:58:29,404 --> 00:58:30,539
Because I

595
00:58:30,938 --> 00:58:32,472
wanted to stay alive.

596
00:58:39,371 --> 00:58:40,739
What did he do to you?

597
00:58:41,938 --> 00:58:43,239
I don't remember.

598
00:58:43,637 --> 00:58:44,638
How bad was it?

599
00:58:57,403 --> 00:58:58,538
Allison.

600
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:01,273
Answer the question.

601
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,405
I can't.

602
00:59:05,537 --> 00:59:06,538
I can't.

603
00:59:07,571 --> 00:59:08,639
Please, I can't.

604
00:59:13,238 --> 00:59:15,173
Okay. Then back under you go.

605
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:27,835
Let me in!

606
01:00:27,837 --> 01:00:29,804
Open this door right now!

607
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,338
Right now!

608
01:00:34,538 --> 01:00:36,605
Leave me alone.

609
01:01:28,937 --> 01:01:31,735
What did I tell you
about locking the door?

610
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:33,605
Get up!

611
01:01:37,905 --> 01:01:39,535
Take it off now!

612
01:01:39,537 --> 01:01:41,536
Is that why you had that door
locked?

613
01:01:41,538 --> 01:01:42,936
Take it off!

614
01:01:42,938 --> 01:01:44,671
That's right cry!

615
01:01:45,605 --> 01:01:48,868
How did you process
your mother's passing?

616
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:50,805
How do you think I processed it?

617
01:01:51,503 --> 01:01:52,603
I was ten.

618
01:01:52,605 --> 01:01:53,736
It sucked.

619
01:01:53,738 --> 01:01:55,438
Cancer's a bitch, right?

620
01:01:56,637 --> 01:01:58,568
I was under the impression your
mother

621
01:01:58,570 --> 01:01:59,969
took her own life.

622
01:01:59,971 --> 01:02:02,171
That's one way to see it, sure.

623
01:02:02,972 --> 01:02:04,702
But that's not how I saw it.

624
01:02:04,704 --> 01:02:05,839
How do you see it?

625
01:02:06,271 --> 01:02:08,638
She was just desperate for a way
out.

626
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:11,702
The cancer was there, alright.

627
01:02:11,704 --> 01:02:14,235
Not something you could see
under a microscope but,

628
01:02:14,237 --> 01:02:16,538
it was there, eating away at
everything.

629
01:02:18,905 --> 01:02:19,906
He let it in.

630
01:02:20,972 --> 01:02:22,635
Your father?

631
01:02:22,637 --> 01:02:23,638
The monster.

632
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,504
And how did he react to her
death?

633
01:02:31,604 --> 01:02:34,402
I know you don't want to discus
these things

634
01:02:34,404 --> 01:02:37,435
but these issues should've been
dealt with earlier.

635
01:02:37,437 --> 01:02:39,301
I was hospitalized for two
years,

636
01:02:39,303 --> 01:02:41,003
I think I dealt with them.

637
01:02:41,005 --> 01:02:42,205
Not properly,

638
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:45,739
or you wouldn't be back here,
now would you?

639
01:02:47,404 --> 01:02:48,404
He drank more.

640
01:02:48,971 --> 01:02:50,839
And that's saying something.

641
01:02:51,303 --> 01:02:53,736
And how did this behavior

642
01:02:53,738 --> 01:02:55,372
affect you at the time?

643
01:02:56,371 --> 01:02:57,739
It's hard to remember.

644
01:02:58,938 --> 01:02:59,939
But it's there.

645
01:03:02,004 --> 01:03:03,371
It's always there.

646
01:03:05,438 --> 01:03:06,438
What is?

647
01:03:07,804 --> 01:03:08,805
The weight.

648
01:03:11,238 --> 01:03:12,872
The gnashing in my stomach.

649
01:03:14,637 --> 01:03:16,271
The poison in my veins.

650
01:03:16,972 --> 01:03:18,639
And it's his blood, too.

651
01:03:19,937 --> 01:03:22,903
And it's black, and it's vile!

652
01:03:22,905 --> 01:03:25,336
And the more I have to fucking
think about it,

653
01:03:25,338 --> 01:03:28,605
the more I want to scratch my
fucking eyes out!

654
01:03:33,338 --> 01:03:34,338
Very good.

655
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:39,171
Now we're getting somewhere.

656
01:03:41,404 --> 01:03:42,636
Why'd you pick her?

657
01:03:42,638 --> 01:03:45,235
I told you, she looked
better than anyone else.

658
01:03:45,237 --> 01:03:47,769
There's something
you're not telling me.

659
01:03:47,771 --> 01:03:50,402
Can't reveal all
my secrets, can I?

660
01:03:50,404 --> 01:03:52,335
She broke my nose, man!

661
01:03:52,337 --> 01:03:54,804
And you're just gonna what. cry
about it?

662
01:03:55,504 --> 01:03:57,235
How about I break your nose,
fucker,

663
01:03:57,237 --> 01:03:58,369
and we see how much you like it?

664
01:03:58,371 --> 01:04:00,336
You know how the game is played.

665
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:02,437
I'm the only one who knows all
the cards.

666
01:04:03,237 --> 01:04:04,736
If you don't like it, then don't
play.

667
01:04:04,738 --> 01:04:05,936
There's something wrong with
her.

668
01:04:05,938 --> 01:04:08,935
Look, this is her
paperwork, right here, okay?

669
01:04:08,937 --> 01:04:10,469
There's a fucking doctor's note
in there,

670
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,903
read it if you don't believe me.

671
01:04:11,905 --> 01:04:12,936
Get rid of her.

672
01:04:12,938 --> 01:04:14,536
You know I can't do that,

673
01:04:14,538 --> 01:04:15,902
not with the crew here.

674
01:04:15,904 --> 01:04:17,268
Send her home.

675
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,571
I need her here tonight.

676
01:04:21,471 --> 01:04:22,472
And right now,

677
01:04:23,438 --> 01:04:25,539
she's putting on one hell of a
show, okay?

678
01:04:25,938 --> 01:04:27,572
Don't you get it?

679
01:04:28,237 --> 01:04:31,338
I'm trying to take us to the
next fucking level.

680
01:04:31,604 --> 01:04:33,504
Everything is riding on this.

681
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:36,535
Perdition, it should be the
best.

682
01:04:36,537 --> 01:04:38,568
And we should be enjoying the
splendors of the best,

683
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:42,535
But no, I have fourteen fucking
dollars in my name,

684
01:04:42,537 --> 01:04:45,269
and I'm eating macaroni and
fucking cheese!

685
01:04:45,271 --> 01:04:47,836
And you can't help
but pick the most unstable,

686
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:49,437
batshit crazy bitch you could
find, right?

687
01:04:49,738 --> 01:04:52,436
And you poke around in that
fragile brain of hers,

688
01:04:52,438 --> 01:04:54,872
just to see what fireworks might
go off?

689
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:58,803
What happened
to helping people, Bob?

690
01:04:58,805 --> 01:05:01,572
If you don't like how I'm
running things,

691
01:05:02,337 --> 01:05:03,338
then go.

692
01:05:04,538 --> 01:05:05,906
Nobody's stopping you.

693
01:05:06,437 --> 01:05:08,237
You're paying for my nose.

694
01:05:09,638 --> 01:05:10,639
Send me a bill.

695
01:05:12,537 --> 01:05:16,271
Get to the back of the fucking
line like everyone else.

696
01:05:18,271 --> 01:05:20,437
Perdition is gonna fail.

697
01:05:21,605 --> 01:05:23,771
And you're a shitty
screenwriter.

698
01:05:25,637 --> 01:05:26,802
Excuse me?

699
01:05:26,804 --> 01:05:28,237
Yeah, you heard me.

700
01:05:30,804 --> 01:05:31,805
Ah!

701
01:05:34,438 --> 01:05:35,438
Stay down, Bob.

702
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:42,272
What're you doing? Get outta
here!

703
01:05:50,771 --> 01:05:52,635
We ain't fuckin' actors, okay?

704
01:05:52,637 --> 01:05:54,838
This ain't playtime. This is
real.

705
01:05:58,838 --> 01:06:01,738
When you say "real," you mean?

706
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:04,772
Real means real.

707
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:08,237
Do you speak English, you stupid
bitch?

708
01:06:11,337 --> 01:06:13,302
The fuck are you guys saying?

709
01:06:13,304 --> 01:06:15,372
What the fuck are you
even doing here?

710
01:06:16,571 --> 01:06:18,372
Goddamnit, get outta here!

711
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:33,935
Hello?

712
01:06:33,937 --> 01:06:35,839
Hey, um, it's me.

713
01:06:36,904 --> 01:06:39,336
I know it's you.
What do you want?

714
01:06:39,338 --> 01:06:41,438
Um... is Taylor there?

715
01:06:42,504 --> 01:06:44,337
He's doing homework.

716
01:06:44,605 --> 01:06:47,372
Look, I just wanted to, you
know, say hi.

717
01:06:48,003 --> 01:06:49,402
Tell him I love him.

718
01:06:49,404 --> 01:06:50,535
We're kinda busy over here,

719
01:06:50,537 --> 01:06:52,301
we don't have all the free time
you do.

720
01:06:52,303 --> 01:06:54,336
I'll tell him you called, okay?

721
01:06:54,338 --> 01:06:58,368
Look, Rene, um, I need to talk
to Taylor, okay?

722
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:00,502
Just have a heart here, okay?

723
01:07:00,504 --> 01:07:02,172
It's been like, a month.

724
01:07:03,704 --> 01:07:05,571
It's not a good time.

725
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:07,604
Well, when...

726
01:07:08,771 --> 01:07:10,238
When is a good time?

727
01:07:11,571 --> 01:07:16,236
You're two months behind
on child support. Two months!

728
01:07:16,238 --> 01:07:17,336
Look, I know. Okay,

729
01:07:17,338 --> 01:07:19,336
but I... I miss him.

730
01:07:19,338 --> 01:07:20,870
I know, I know,

731
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:24,335
Taylor needs food Bob. Taylor
needs clothes.

732
01:07:24,337 --> 01:07:25,867
Taylor needs health insurance.

733
01:07:25,869 --> 01:07:27,536
He's falling behind on his
reading,

734
01:07:27,538 --> 01:07:28,868
and now I have to pay for a
tutor.

735
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:30,704
Do you have money for that?

736
01:07:32,936 --> 01:07:34,002
No.

737
01:07:34,004 --> 01:07:35,402
No, of course not.

738
01:07:35,404 --> 01:07:36,469
You never have money.

739
01:07:36,471 --> 01:07:39,739
You can talk to Taylor when you
pay what you owe.

740
01:07:40,471 --> 01:07:42,338
Look, I'm his father, Rene.

741
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:43,738
Then act like it!

742
01:07:44,937 --> 01:07:45,938
Anything else?

743
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:50,572
Yeah.

744
01:07:52,437 --> 01:07:53,768
Go fuck yourself!

745
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:55,835
Nice. So nice. Scumbag.

746
01:07:55,837 --> 01:07:58,472
Rene, no, Rene, just let me
speak to...

747
01:08:34,304 --> 01:08:35,905
Move fucker!

748
01:08:48,904 --> 01:08:50,767
The next game is called, "Run."

749
01:08:50,769 --> 01:08:52,901
I don't wanna play.
It's freezing!

750
01:08:52,903 --> 01:08:54,704
I don't wanna play!

751
01:08:54,971 --> 01:08:57,272
I didn't fucking ask you, pansy!

752
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:03,372
Are you scared?

753
01:09:04,438 --> 01:09:05,505
It's not loaded.

754
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:18,238
Think again.

755
01:09:21,936 --> 01:09:24,504
Ain't no use in crying, little
baby!

756
01:09:25,936 --> 01:09:27,937
It ain't gonna do you no good!

757
01:09:30,503 --> 01:09:31,505
Shit!

758
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:33,969
Nell pick up.

759
01:09:33,971 --> 01:09:34,835
Go.

760
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:35,868
Is everything okay over there?

761
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:36,935
She's got a gun!

762
01:09:36,937 --> 01:09:39,335
10-9, I didn't get that.

763
01:09:39,337 --> 01:09:40,868
I said we're having fun!

764
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:41,871
10-4.

765
01:09:42,869 --> 01:09:44,271
Turn that shit off.

766
01:09:45,769 --> 01:09:47,667
As I was saying,

767
01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:49,737
the next game is called, "Run."

768
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:51,468
The object of the game is

769
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:53,271
to not fucking get caught.

770
01:09:53,538 --> 01:09:55,438
If you get caught, you lose.

771
01:09:56,437 --> 01:09:58,538
I'd suggest not getting caught.

772
01:10:01,503 --> 01:10:02,505
Now run.

773
01:10:05,736 --> 01:10:07,668
Run, little piggies!

774
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:08,638
Run!

775
01:10:39,371 --> 01:10:41,338
Let's go huntin', sis.

776
01:11:22,636 --> 01:11:24,336
They're gonna fucking kill us.

777
01:11:24,338 --> 01:11:25,338
Quiet!

778
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:30,837
Did you hear that?

779
01:11:44,003 --> 01:11:45,204
Gotcha, baby!

780
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,670
- Bum a smoke, man?
- Yeah.

781
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:53,703
Cathy picking you up?

782
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:57,337
Yeah, she'll be
here in a few minutes.

783
01:12:23,437 --> 01:12:25,369
Think we ever go too far?

784
01:12:25,371 --> 01:12:26,372
What's too far?

785
01:12:27,271 --> 01:12:28,602
Fucking people up forever.

786
01:12:28,604 --> 01:12:29,604
No.

787
01:12:30,603 --> 01:12:32,435
We haven't gone that far.

788
01:12:32,437 --> 01:12:33,437
Not yet.

789
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:35,468
It's too much white noise now.

790
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:38,368
That's why we have to keep going
harder and harder.

791
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:39,935
Otherwise, we're
just gonna be forgotten

792
01:12:39,937 --> 01:12:41,371
and... I don't know.

793
01:12:42,569 --> 01:12:43,937
Like we never existed.

794
01:13:27,804 --> 01:13:29,336
I was first.

795
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:30,501
They all stole it from me.

796
01:13:30,503 --> 01:13:33,470
These... these damn movie studios

797
01:13:33,704 --> 01:13:34,902
fuckin' franchises,

798
01:13:34,904 --> 01:13:37,002
these East Coast hipster
perverts.

799
01:13:37,004 --> 01:13:39,301
These fuckin' horror directors,

800
01:13:39,303 --> 01:13:40,735
and they got nothin' better to
do.

801
01:13:40,737 --> 01:13:43,401
You got to remember
why you started this.

802
01:13:43,403 --> 01:13:45,804
Not to be the best. Not for the
money.

803
01:13:46,737 --> 01:13:47,935
You did it because there's not

804
01:13:47,937 --> 01:13:48,801
a night that goes by

805
01:13:48,803 --> 01:13:50,938
that you don't wake up in a cold
sweat.

806
01:13:51,769 --> 01:13:53,538
You're fuckin' scarin' me.

807
01:13:54,337 --> 01:13:56,801
- You're in the right place.
- John!

808
01:13:56,803 --> 01:13:59,802
- You smokin' again?
- God no! Swear to God, no!

809
01:13:59,804 --> 01:14:01,235
Get your ass in here.

810
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:02,671
Gotta go, man.

811
01:14:20,737 --> 01:14:21,738
Stop!

812
01:14:22,769 --> 01:14:24,172
Turn around.

813
01:14:26,569 --> 01:14:27,601
Guess what?

814
01:14:27,603 --> 01:14:28,604
You won!

815
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:33,235
Yup. So that means
you get to keep your life.

816
01:14:33,237 --> 01:14:36,336
And this little turd over here
gets to fuckin' die!

817
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:38,001
Allison, don't let them kill me!

818
01:14:38,003 --> 01:14:39,737
They're not gonna kill you.

819
01:14:40,637 --> 01:14:42,205
Because this is fake.

820
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:44,501
Yeah.

821
01:14:44,503 --> 01:14:45,504
You're right.

822
01:14:45,837 --> 01:14:47,570
We're not gonna kill him.

823
01:14:47,804 --> 01:14:48,802
Because...

824
01:14:48,804 --> 01:14:49,804
you are.

825
01:14:51,604 --> 01:14:53,838
Point the fucking gun at his
head.

826
01:14:55,736 --> 01:14:56,738
No.

827
01:14:57,502 --> 01:15:00,001
What? You think this fuckin' boy

828
01:15:00,003 --> 01:15:02,002
is any different from all the
other men

829
01:15:02,004 --> 01:15:04,237
that have used and abused you?

830
01:15:04,936 --> 01:15:06,603
Oh c'mon, Allison.

831
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:10,701
This little fucker's gonna go
off to college,

832
01:15:10,703 --> 01:15:12,803
and the first party he comes to,

833
01:15:13,237 --> 01:15:16,603
he's gonna find some drunk,
unsuspecting girl,

834
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:18,634
he's gonna get her alone,

835
01:15:18,636 --> 01:15:20,435
he's gonna fucking rip her
panties off,

836
01:15:20,437 --> 01:15:22,734
stick her face in the couch
cushion,

837
01:15:22,736 --> 01:15:25,171
and fucking rape her.

838
01:15:25,971 --> 01:15:27,902
I'd never do that, Allison,

839
01:15:27,904 --> 01:15:29,935
I swear to God, I swear!

840
01:15:29,937 --> 01:15:30,801
Liar.

841
01:15:30,803 --> 01:15:32,271
He's a fucking liar!

842
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:34,935
You gonna let that happen,
Allison?

843
01:15:34,937 --> 01:15:37,500
She's gonna have to live with that
for the rest of her goddamn life

844
01:15:37,502 --> 01:15:38,868
and you're gonna let that
happen?!

845
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:40,701
Are you gonna fucking do
something about him

846
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,336
and kill him right now?

847
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:45,668
Do it. Do it, Allison.

848
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:46,767
Do it!

849
01:15:46,769 --> 01:15:48,835
Allison, I can blow your brains
out

850
01:15:48,837 --> 01:15:49,934
a fucking killer...

851
01:15:49,936 --> 01:15:50,938
Do it!

852
01:15:55,603 --> 01:15:56,703
The fuck?

853
01:15:57,536 --> 01:15:58,835
Jesus fucking Christ!

854
01:15:58,837 --> 01:16:00,404
- What the fuck!
- Oh no!

855
01:16:02,904 --> 01:16:03,934
I gave them the wrong...

856
01:16:03,936 --> 01:16:05,002
I gave her the right gun!

857
01:16:05,004 --> 01:16:06,467
He's dead!

858
01:16:06,469 --> 01:16:08,935
I gave her the right gun! I
gave her the wrong fucking gun,

859
01:16:08,937 --> 01:16:10,301
what the fuck?!

860
01:16:10,303 --> 01:16:11,701
This is a fucking fake gun!

861
01:16:11,703 --> 01:16:12,934
He's not supposed to be dead!

862
01:16:12,936 --> 01:16:14,368
I didn't fucking do this!

863
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:16,205
- I gave her the gun!
- Somebody help!

864
01:16:19,904 --> 01:16:20,902
Help!

865
01:16:20,904 --> 01:16:22,204
Please!

866
01:16:22,469 --> 01:16:24,470
- Help me!
- Hurry the fuck up!

867
01:16:25,302 --> 01:16:27,236
- Please!
- Come on, come on! Get her!

868
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:28,538
Get her! Fuck!

869
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:31,537
Fuck! What the fuck happened!

870
01:16:41,637 --> 01:16:43,735
Did you do the dishes, sweetie?

871
01:16:43,737 --> 01:16:44,738
Yes, Daddy.

872
01:16:47,837 --> 01:16:49,738
Something you wanna tell me?

873
01:16:50,937 --> 01:16:51,938
No, Daddy.

874
01:16:57,836 --> 01:16:59,303
'Cause I, uh,

875
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:02,871
found a bowl that was missing
from the...

876
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:04,871
cupboard.

877
01:17:08,536 --> 01:17:11,204
And, uh, the funny thing is,

878
01:17:11,703 --> 01:17:13,002
I found it

879
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:14,671
in the trash can.

880
01:17:15,636 --> 01:17:17,268
It was all shattered,

881
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:18,503
and, uh, some blood

882
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:20,670
next to the trash can.

883
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:23,538
I dropped it from the sink.

884
01:17:24,769 --> 01:17:25,771
It broke.

885
01:17:34,503 --> 01:17:35,838
Did you cut yourself?

886
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:52,400
- Where's the body?
- It's still there.

887
01:17:52,402 --> 01:17:54,367
You left the body in the woods?

888
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:56,400
What, I don't know
what the fuck to do with it!?

889
01:17:56,402 --> 01:17:58,002
What if somebody...
You want me to fucking go get it?

890
01:17:58,004 --> 01:18:00,404
Fine. Fuck, I'll go get it!

891
01:18:02,369 --> 01:18:03,500
Bring the body here,

892
01:18:03,502 --> 01:18:05,570
and I'll figure out what to do.

893
01:18:13,937 --> 01:18:16,370
The straps are for your own
safety.

894
01:18:17,369 --> 01:18:19,204
So you don't hurt yourself.

895
01:18:19,536 --> 01:18:20,570
Where's Zachary?

896
01:18:21,804 --> 01:18:23,334
Allison, that was an accident.

897
01:18:23,336 --> 01:18:24,534
No, we need to call the police.

898
01:18:24,536 --> 01:18:25,538
No, just...

899
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:28,234
No police.

900
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:29,734
We kil-we killed him.

901
01:18:29,736 --> 01:18:32,368
Yeah, and you pulled the
trigger, okay?

902
01:18:32,370 --> 01:18:34,234
So just... no... police.

903
01:18:34,236 --> 01:18:35,401
It's m-murder.

904
01:18:35,403 --> 01:18:36,500
Don't

905
01:18:36,502 --> 01:18:37,534
say that.

906
01:18:37,536 --> 01:18:39,304
Don't ever say that again.

907
01:18:40,537 --> 01:18:41,601
It was an accident.

908
01:18:41,603 --> 01:18:43,835
There's no one to blame.
No one needs to find out.

909
01:18:43,837 --> 01:18:44,838
No.

910
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:46,400
No.

911
01:18:46,402 --> 01:18:47,404
We killed him!

912
01:18:49,636 --> 01:18:50,638
Allison.

913
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:53,171
I'm not going to go to jail.

914
01:18:54,402 --> 01:18:55,670
I'm not gonna lose

915
01:18:55,904 --> 01:18:57,703
what little I have left.
Not for him.

916
01:18:57,970 --> 01:18:59,435
And not for you, okay?

917
01:18:59,437 --> 01:19:01,471
And I will bury you

918
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:03,171
both.

919
01:19:03,503 --> 01:19:04,937
Before I let it happen.

920
01:19:05,936 --> 01:19:07,270
Don't...

921
01:19:08,236 --> 01:19:09,236
test me.

922
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:11,703
Now,

923
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:14,237
what are we gonna do?

924
01:19:17,769 --> 01:19:20,537
You know, maybe I know
someone who can

925
01:19:22,236 --> 01:19:24,470
change your perspective on
things.

926
01:19:30,903 --> 01:19:31,905
Help!

927
01:19:32,803 --> 01:19:33,938
Somebody help me!

928
01:19:37,502 --> 01:19:39,670
Somebody help me!

929
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:43,771
Are you ready?

930
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:45,571
Somebody!

931
01:19:46,869 --> 01:19:47,904
Then go.

932
01:19:48,937 --> 01:19:50,236
It's your time.

933
01:20:04,502 --> 01:20:05,567
Help me!

934
01:20:05,569 --> 01:20:06,603
Help me, please!

935
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:09,838
Please, we need to call the
police! Please!

936
01:20:10,804 --> 01:20:13,434
I don't know what you want from
me!

937
01:20:13,436 --> 01:20:14,603
Please let me go!

938
01:20:30,736 --> 01:20:32,270
No! No! No!

939
01:20:32,603 --> 01:20:33,603
Wha-Get awa-

940
01:20:33,837 --> 01:20:34,835
No!

941
01:20:34,837 --> 01:20:35,838
No!

942
01:20:36,403 --> 01:20:37,371
No!

943
01:20:38,936 --> 01:20:41,204
Don't be scared.
Don't be scared.

944
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:43,867
I'm sorry I had to wear the
mask.

945
01:20:43,869 --> 01:20:45,235
They made me.

946
01:20:45,237 --> 01:20:46,269
No!

947
01:20:46,271 --> 01:20:48,803
It was the only way I could
come and see you.

948
01:20:50,437 --> 01:20:51,938
I know I did bad to you.

949
01:20:52,436 --> 01:20:54,235
- No!
- I wasn't right in the head then.

950
01:20:54,237 --> 01:20:55,868
After Mom died,

951
01:20:55,870 --> 01:20:58,267
it was the booze, it was never
me!

952
01:20:58,269 --> 01:20:59,271
Never me.

953
01:21:00,337 --> 01:21:01,671
And I did my time.

954
01:21:02,703 --> 01:21:05,770
And you know I paid for what I
did to you.

955
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:08,738
Fuck you! You didn't pay for
shit!

956
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:12,301
I can't let you run away again.

957
01:21:12,303 --> 01:21:13,304
No!

958
01:21:13,736 --> 01:21:15,837
We can go back to the way it
was.

959
01:21:16,269 --> 01:21:18,436
Remember? You remember?

960
01:21:18,904 --> 01:21:21,837
Remember how good I used to make
you feel?

961
01:21:24,703 --> 01:21:25,703
I remember.

962
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:28,571
I think about it every day.

963
01:21:29,269 --> 01:21:30,336
And every night.

964
01:21:50,436 --> 01:21:52,236
No. No!

965
01:21:53,637 --> 01:21:56,468
This is for every time you ever

966
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:59,671
tortured and degraded me.
You evil fucking piece of shit!

967
01:22:59,804 --> 01:23:01,601
Damn fake blood got in my eye

968
01:23:01,603 --> 01:23:04,537
when that squib went off, stings
like hell.

969
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:06,371
What the fuck?

970
01:23:09,336 --> 01:23:10,337
Allison.

971
01:23:12,002 --> 01:23:13,204
Liar.

972
01:23:14,803 --> 01:23:15,803
Look.

973
01:23:16,935 --> 01:23:20,237
Don't do anything you're
gonna regret, okay? Yeah?

974
01:23:21,237 --> 01:23:22,604
I'm in on it, alright?

975
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:26,301
I've been in on it from the start,
I'm part of the crew, okay?

976
01:23:26,303 --> 01:23:28,738
But this is, this is all just
part show.

977
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:30,704
Part of the experience.

978
01:23:31,303 --> 01:23:33,234
Like bringing my father here,

979
01:23:33,236 --> 01:23:34,770
part of the fucking show?

980
01:23:35,002 --> 01:23:37,936
I don't know anything about your
father, alright Allison? Okay?

981
01:23:38,868 --> 01:23:39,870
You're a liar.

982
01:23:40,503 --> 01:23:41,869
I fucking trusted you!

983
01:23:43,569 --> 01:23:44,571
Listen. Okay.

984
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:47,604
You need help, Allison.

985
01:23:47,935 --> 01:23:50,869
Alright, so, why don't we
put the bat down?

986
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:53,837
We both call 911 together?

987
01:23:57,269 --> 01:23:58,271
Please.

988
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:04,471
Allison, stop, this isn't real!

989
01:24:11,469 --> 01:24:15,170
I'm sorry! Allison. I'm sorry!

990
01:24:23,569 --> 01:24:24,571
Fuck you!

991
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:34,304
That...

992
01:24:34,603 --> 01:24:35,901
felt good.

993
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:08,571
Allison, you, uh...

994
01:25:09,936 --> 01:25:10,937
y-you did it.

995
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:15,304
You-You survived Perdition.

996
01:25:16,569 --> 01:25:17,571
Look, um,

997
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:19,702
I'm proud of you,

998
01:25:19,704 --> 01:25:20,704
but, uh,

999
01:25:21,269 --> 01:25:22,267
now it's just,

1000
01:25:22,269 --> 01:25:23,271
now it's time to just-

1001
01:25:23,669 --> 01:25:24,737
put down the bat, and-

1002
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:26,869
and go home, okay?

1003
01:25:27,503 --> 01:25:28,504
It's over.

1004
01:25:29,836 --> 01:25:31,371
Now Allison, Allison just-

1005
01:25:32,269 --> 01:25:34,567
just put it down okay.
No, no, no! Wa-Wa-Wait!

1006
01:25:45,936 --> 01:25:47,204
Oh my god...

1007
01:25:48,269 --> 01:25:49,470
Allison, look just...

1008
01:25:50,769 --> 01:25:53,604
just stop before you do anymore
harm, okay?

1009
01:25:55,436 --> 01:25:57,570
You're having a mental
breakdown.

1010
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:03,437
No, Bob. I'm having a
breakthrough.

1011
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:23,571
Oh God!

1012
01:26:48,337 --> 01:26:49,337
Daddy?

1013
01:26:51,403 --> 01:26:52,203
Taylor.

1014
01:26:53,603 --> 01:26:55,235
Mommy didn't want me to call,

1015
01:26:55,237 --> 01:26:57,234
but she's in the shower,
so I took her phone.

1016
01:26:57,236 --> 01:27:01,503
I just wanted to tell you that I
miss you and that I love you a lot.

1017
01:27:02,436 --> 01:27:03,436
I love you, too

1018
01:27:04,635 --> 01:27:05,637
Listen.

1019
01:27:08,537 --> 01:27:12,503
I'm always gonna love you.
I'm sorry for everything.

1020
01:27:15,503 --> 01:27:17,770
Why are you crying, Daddy?

1021
01:27:21,337 --> 01:27:22,703
Daddy? Daddy?

1022
01:27:39,736 --> 01:27:42,271
That pretty little map
on the bottom of your mask?

1023
01:27:43,369 --> 01:27:46,370
I knew what that was
before you said a word.

1024
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:50,837
Do you know what's at the bottom
of hell?

1025
01:27:51,935 --> 01:27:53,336
Charlatans.

1026
01:27:54,437 --> 01:27:55,504
And con artists.

1027
01:27:57,403 --> 01:27:59,204
That's all you'll ever be.

1028
01:28:11,269 --> 01:28:12,271
Oh God!

1029
01:28:57,602 --> 01:28:58,569
Go.

1030
01:29:36,336 --> 01:29:37,436
It's just us now.

1031
01:29:40,536 --> 01:29:41,537
Don't worry.

1032
01:29:42,636 --> 01:29:43,869
It will all be over soon.

1033
01:29:53,669 --> 01:29:54,670
Shhh.

1034
01:30:56,402 --> 01:30:57,403
Goodbye, Daddy.

1035
01:31:24,902 --> 01:31:26,270
It happened again.

1036
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:28,271
I know.

1037
01:31:29,936 --> 01:31:31,204
I don't like it.

1038
01:31:32,902 --> 01:31:33,904
It feels wrong.

1039
01:31:35,302 --> 01:31:36,304
It feels ugly.

1040
01:31:38,602 --> 01:31:40,400
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1041
01:31:40,402 --> 01:31:42,603
I'm gonna get us both out of
here.

1042
01:31:43,836 --> 01:31:44,837
Okay, mom.

1043
01:31:46,401 --> 01:31:47,636
Don't call me that.

1044
01:31:47,936 --> 01:31:49,503
I'm your sister, okay?

1045
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:54,271
Okay.

1046
01:32:49,369 --> 01:32:50,770
This is my exit video.

1047
01:32:51,868 --> 01:32:54,435
Tonight was important for me.

1048
01:32:55,802 --> 01:32:56,937
Filled with fear.

1049
01:32:57,869 --> 01:32:58,870
Vengeance.

1050
01:33:00,836 --> 01:33:02,837
Acceptance.

1051
01:33:03,236 --> 01:33:04,236
Death.

1052
01:33:04,935 --> 01:33:05,937
Rebirth.

1053
01:33:07,736 --> 01:33:10,403
It was... It was truly beautiful.

1054
01:33:13,536 --> 01:33:15,203
I survived Perdition

1055
01:33:33,268 --> 01:33:35,233
- I'm flipping starving!
- I swear to God,

1056
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:37,266
if I open this thing and
there's dog feces in it,

1057
01:33:37,268 --> 01:33:38,536
I'm gonna fart in your mouth.

1058
01:33:44,235 --> 01:33:45,536
Who the hell is that?

1059
01:33:48,602 --> 01:33:50,569
Turn off your lights, asshole!

1060
